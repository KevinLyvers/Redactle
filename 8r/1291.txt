acupuncture, is, a, form, of, alternative, medicine, and, a, component, of, traditional, chinese, medicine, tcm, in, which, thin, needles, are, inserted, into, the, body, acupuncture, is, a, pseudoscience, the, theories, and, practices, of, tcm, are, not, based, on, scientific, knowledge, and, it, has, been, characterized, as, quackery, there, is, a, range, of, acupuncture, technological, variants, that, originated, in, different, philosophies, and, techniques, vary, depending, on, the, country, in, which, it, is, performed, however, it, can, be, divided, into, two, main, foundational, philosophical, applications, and, approaches, the, first, being, the, modern, standardized, form, called, eight, principles, tcm, and, the, second, being, an, older, system, that, is, based, on, the, ancient, daoist, wuxing, better, known, as, the, five, elements, or, phases, in, the, west, acupuncture, is, most, often, used, to, attempt, pain, relief, though, acupuncturists, say, that, it, can, also, be, used, for, a, wide, range, of, other, conditions, acupuncture, is, generally, used, only, in, combination, with, other, forms, of, treatment, the, global, acupuncture, market, was, worth, us, 24, 55, billion, in, 2017, the, market, was, led, by, europe, with, a, 32, 7, share, followed, by, asia, pacific, with, a, 29, 4, share, and, the, americas, with, a, 25, 3, share, it, was, estimated, in, 2021, that, the, industry, would, reach, a, market, size, of, us, 55, billion, by, 2023, the, conclusions, of, trials, and, systematic, reviews, of, acupuncture, generally, provide, no, good, evidence, of, benefit, which, suggests, that, it, is, not, an, effective, method, of, healthcare, acupuncture, is, generally, safe, when, done, by, appropriately, trained, practitioners, using, clean, needle, technique, and, single, use, needles, when, properly, delivered, it, has, a, low, rate, of, mostly, minor, adverse, effects, when, accidents, and, infections, do, occur, they, are, associated, with, neglect, on, the, part, of, the, practitioner, particularly, in, the, application, of, sterile, techniques, a, review, conducted, in, 2013, stated, that, reports, of, infection, transmission, increased, significantly, in, the, preceding, decade, the, most, frequently, reported, adverse, events, were, pneumothorax, and, infections, since, serious, adverse, events, continue, to, be, reported, it, is, recommended, that, acupuncturists, be, trained, sufficiently, to, reduce, the, risk, scientific, investigation, has, not, found, any, histological, or, physiological, evidence, for, traditional, chinese, concepts, such, as, qi, meridians, and, acupuncture, points, and, many, modern, practitioners, no, longer, support, the, existence, of, life, force, energy, qi, or, meridians, which, was, a, major, part, of, early, belief, systems, acupuncture, is, believed, to, have, originated, around, 100, bc, in, china, around, the, time, the, inner, classic, of, huang, di, huangdi, neijing, was, published, though, some, experts, suggest, it, could, have, been, practiced, earlier, over, time, conflicting, claims, and, belief, systems, emerged, about, the, effect, of, lunar, celestial, and, earthly, cycles, yin, and, yang, energies, and, a, body, s, rhythm, on, the, effectiveness, of, treatment, acupuncture, fluctuated, in, popularity, in, china, due, to, changes, in, the, country, s, political, leadership, and, the, preferential, use, of, rationalism, or, scientific, medicine, acupuncture, spread, first, to, korea, in, the, 6th, century, ad, then, to, japan, through, medical, missionaries, and, then, to, europe, beginning, with, france, in, the, 20th, century, as, it, spread, to, the, united, states, and, western, countries, spiritual, elements, of, acupuncture, that, conflicted, with, scientific, knowledge, were, sometimes, abandoned, in, favor, of, simply, tapping, needles, into, acupuncture, points, acupuncture, is, a, form, of, alternative, medicine, it, is, used, most, commonly, for, pain, relief, though, it, is, also, used, to, treat, a, wide, range, of, conditions, acupuncture, is, generally, only, used, in, combination, with, other, forms, of, treatment, for, example, the, american, society, of, anesthesiologists, states, it, may, be, considered, in, the, treatment, of, nonspecific, noninflammatory, low, back, pain, only, in, conjunction, with, conventional, therapy, acupuncture, is, the, insertion, of, thin, needles, into, the, skin, according, to, the, mayo, foundation, for, medical, education, and, research, mayo, clinic, a, typical, session, entails, lying, still, while, approximately, five, to, twenty, needles, are, inserted, for, the, majority, of, cases, the, needles, will, be, left, in, place, for, ten, to, twenty, minutes, it, can, be, associated, with, the, application, of, heat, pressure, or, laser, light, classically, acupuncture, is, individualized, and, based, on, philosophy, and, intuition, and, not, on, scientific, research, there, is, also, a, non, invasive, therapy, developed, in, early, 20th, century, japan, using, an, elaborate, set, of, instruments, other, than, needles, for, the, treatment, of, children, sh, nishin, or, sh, nihari, clinical, practice, varies, depending, on, the, country, a, comparison, of, the, average, number, of, patients, treated, per, hour, found, significant, differences, between, china, 10, and, the, united, states, 1, 2, chinese, herbs, are, often, used, there, is, a, diverse, range, of, acupuncture, approaches, involving, different, philosophies, although, various, different, techniques, of, acupuncture, practice, have, emerged, the, method, used, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, tcm, seems, to, be, the, most, widely, adopted, in, the, us, traditional, acupuncture, involves, needle, insertion, moxibustion, and, cupping, therapy, and, may, be, accompanied, by, other, procedures, such, as, feeling, the, pulse, and, other, parts, of, the, body, and, examining, the, tongue, traditional, acupuncture, involves, the, belief, that, a, life, force, qi, circulates, within, the, body, in, lines, called, meridians, the, main, methods, practiced, in, the, uk, are, tcm, and, western, medical, acupuncture, the, term, western, medical, acupuncture, is, used, to, indicate, an, adaptation, of, tcm, based, acupuncture, which, focuses, less, on, tcm, the, western, medical, acupuncture, approach, involves, using, acupuncture, after, a, medical, diagnosis, limited, research, has, compared, the, contrasting, acupuncture, systems, used, in, various, countries, for, determining, different, acupuncture, points, and, thus, there, is, no, defined, standard, for, acupuncture, points, in, traditional, acupuncture, the, acupuncturist, decides, which, points, to, treat, by, observing, and, questioning, the, patient, to, make, a, diagnosis, according, to, the, tradition, used, in, tcm, the, four, diagnostic, methods, are, inspection, auscultation, and, olfaction, inquiring, and, palpation, inspection, focuses, on, the, face, and, particularly, on, the, tongue, including, analysis, of, the, tongue, size, shape, tension, color, and, coating, and, the, absence, or, presence, of, teeth, marks, around, the, edge, auscultation, and, olfaction, involve, listening, for, particular, sounds, such, as, wheezing, and, observing, body, odor, inquiring, involves, focusing, on, the, seven, inquiries, chills, and, fever, perspiration, appetite, thirst, and, taste, defecation, and, urination, pain, sleep, and, menses, and, leukorrhea, palpation, is, focusing, on, feeling, the, body, for, tender, a, shi, points, and, feeling, the, pulse, the, most, common, mechanism, of, stimulation, of, acupuncture, points, employs, penetration, of, the, skin, by, thin, metal, needles, which, are, manipulated, manually, or, the, needle, may, be, further, stimulated, by, electrical, stimulation, electroacupuncture, acupuncture, needles, are, typically, made, of, stainless, steel, making, them, flexible, and, preventing, them, from, rusting, or, breaking, needles, are, usually, disposed, of, after, each, use, to, prevent, contamination, reusable, needles, when, used, should, be, sterilized, between, applications, in, many, areas, only, sterile, single, use, acupuncture, needles, are, allowed, including, the, state, of, california, usa, needles, vary, in, length, between, 13, and, 130, millimetres, 0, 51, and, 5, 12, in, with, shorter, needles, used, near, the, face, and, eyes, and, longer, needles, in, areas, with, thicker, tissues, needle, diameters, vary, from, 0, 16, mm, 0, 006, in, to, 0, 46, mm, 0, 018, in, with, thicker, needles, used, on, more, robust, patients, thinner, needles, may, be, flexible, and, require, tubes, for, insertion, the, tip, of, the, needle, should, not, be, made, too, sharp, to, prevent, breakage, although, blunt, needles, cause, more, pain, apart, from, the, usual, filiform, needle, other, needle, types, include, three, edged, needles, and, the, nine, ancient, needles, japanese, acupuncturists, use, extremely, thin, needles, that, are, used, superficially, sometimes, without, penetrating, the, skin, and, surrounded, by, a, guide, tube, a, 17th, century, invention, adopted, in, china, and, the, west, korean, acupuncture, uses, copper, needles, and, has, a, greater, focus, on, the, hand, the, skin, is, sterilized, and, needles, are, inserted, frequently, with, a, plastic, guide, tube, needles, may, be, manipulated, in, various, ways, including, spinning, flicking, or, moving, up, and, down, relative, to, the, skin, since, most, pain, is, felt, in, the, superficial, layers, of, the, skin, a, quick, insertion, of, the, needle, is, recommended, often, the, needles, are, stimulated, by, hand, in, order, to, cause, a, dull, localized, aching, sensation, that, is, called, de, qi, as, well, as, needle, grasp, a, tugging, feeling, felt, by, the, acupuncturist, and, generated, by, a, mechanical, interaction, between, the, needle, and, skin, acupuncture, can, be, painful, the, acupuncturist, s, skill, level, may, influence, the, painfulness, of, the, needle, insertion, a, sufficiently, skilled, practitioner, may, be, able, to, insert, the, needles, without, causing, any, pain, de, qi, chinese, pinyin, d, q, arrival, of, qi, refers, to, a, claimed, sensation, of, numbness, distension, or, electrical, tingling, at, the, needling, site, if, these, sensations, are, not, observed, then, inaccurate, location, of, the, acupoint, improper, depth, of, needle, insertion, inadequate, manual, manipulation, are, blamed, if, de, qi, is, not, immediately, observed, upon, needle, insertion, various, manual, manipulation, techniques, are, often, applied, to, promote, it, such, as, plucking, shaking, or, trembling, once, de, qi, is, observed, techniques, might, be, used, which, attempt, to, influence, the, de, qi, for, example, by, certain, manipulation, the, de, qi, can, allegedly, be, conducted, from, the, needling, site, towards, more, distant, sites, of, the, body, other, techniques, aim, at, tonifying, chinese, pinyin, b, or, sedating, chinese, pinyin, xi, qi, the, former, techniques, are, used, in, deficiency, patterns, the, latter, in, excess, patterns, de, qi, is, more, important, in, chinese, acupuncture, while, western, and, japanese, patients, may, not, consider, it, a, necessary, part, of, the, treatment, as, of, 2021, many, thousands, of, papers, had, been, published, on, the, efficacy, of, acupuncture, for, the, treatment, of, various, adult, health, conditions, but, there, was, no, robust, evidence, it, was, beneficial, for, anything, except, shoulder, pain, and, fibromyalgia, for, science, based, medicine, steven, novella, wrote, that, the, overall, pattern, of, evidence, was, reminiscent, of, that, for, homeopathy, compatible, with, the, hypothesis, that, most, if, not, all, benefits, were, due, to, the, placebo, effect, and, strongly, suggestive, that, acupuncture, had, no, beneficial, therapeutic, effects, at, all, it, is, difficult, but, not, impossible, to, design, rigorous, research, trials, for, acupuncture, due, to, acupuncture, s, invasive, nature, one, of, the, major, challenges, in, efficacy, research, is, in, the, design, of, an, appropriate, placebo, control, group, for, efficacy, studies, to, determine, whether, acupuncture, has, specific, effects, sham, forms, of, acupuncture, where, the, patient, practitioner, and, analyst, are, blinded, seem, the, most, acceptable, approach, sham, acupuncture, uses, non, penetrating, needles, or, needling, at, non, acupuncture, points, e, g, inserting, needles, on, meridians, not, related, to, the, specific, condition, being, studied, or, in, places, not, associated, with, meridians, the, under, performance, of, acupuncture, in, such, trials, may, indicate, that, therapeutic, effects, are, due, entirely, to, non, specific, effects, or, that, the, sham, treatments, are, not, inert, or, that, systematic, protocols, yield, less, than, optimal, treatment, a, 2014, review, in, nature, reviews, cancer, found, that, contrary, to, the, claimed, mechanism, of, redirecting, the, flow, of, qi, through, meridians, researchers, usually, find, that, it, generally, does, not, matter, where, the, needles, are, inserted, how, often, that, is, no, dose, response, effect, is, observed, or, even, if, needles, are, actually, inserted, in, other, words, sham, or, placebo, acupuncture, generally, produces, the, same, effects, as, real, acupuncture, and, in, some, cases, does, better, a, 2013, meta, analysis, found, little, evidence, that, the, effectiveness, of, acupuncture, on, pain, compared, to, sham, was, modified, by, the, location, of, the, needles, the, number, of, needles, used, the, experience, or, technique, of, the, practitioner, or, by, the, circumstances, of, the, sessions, the, same, analysis, also, suggested, that, the, number, of, needles, and, sessions, is, important, as, greater, numbers, improved, the, outcomes, of, acupuncture, compared, to, non, acupuncture, controls, there, has, been, little, systematic, investigation, of, which, components, of, an, acupuncture, session, may, be, important, for, any, therapeutic, effect, including, needle, placement, and, depth, type, and, intensity, of, stimulation, and, number, of, needles, used, the, research, seems, to, suggest, that, needles, do, not, need, to, stimulate, the, traditionally, specified, acupuncture, points, or, penetrate, the, skin, to, attain, an, anticipated, effect, e, g, psychosocial, factors, a, response, to, sham, acupuncture, in, osteoarthritis, may, be, used, in, the, elderly, but, placebos, have, usually, been, regarded, as, deception, and, thus, unethical, however, some, physicians, and, ethicists, have, suggested, circumstances, for, applicable, uses, for, placebos, such, as, it, might, present, a, theoretical, advantage, of, an, inexpensive, treatment, without, adverse, reactions, or, interactions, with, drugs, or, other, medications, as, the, evidence, for, most, types, of, alternative, medicine, such, as, acupuncture, is, far, from, strong, the, use, of, alternative, medicine, in, regular, healthcare, can, present, an, ethical, question, using, the, principles, of, evidence, based, medicine, to, research, acupuncture, is, controversial, and, has, produced, different, results, some, research, suggests, acupuncture, can, alleviate, pain, but, the, majority, of, research, suggests, that, acupuncture, s, effects, are, mainly, due, to, placebo, evidence, suggests, that, any, benefits, of, acupuncture, are, short, lasting, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, support, use, of, acupuncture, compared, to, mainstream, medical, treatments, acupuncture, is, not, better, than, mainstream, treatment, in, the, long, term, the, use, of, acupuncture, has, been, criticized, owing, to, there, being, little, scientific, evidence, for, explicit, effects, or, the, mechanisms, for, its, supposed, effectiveness, for, any, condition, that, is, discernible, from, placebo, acupuncture, has, been, called, theatrical, placebo, and, david, gorski, argues, that, when, acupuncture, proponents, advocate, harnessing, of, placebo, effects, or, work, on, developing, meaningful, placebos, they, essentially, concede, it, is, little, more, than, that, publication, bias, is, cited, as, a, concern, in, the, reviews, of, randomized, controlled, trials, of, acupuncture, a, 1998, review, of, studies, on, acupuncture, found, that, trials, originating, in, china, japan, hong, kong, and, taiwan, were, uniformly, favourable, to, acupuncture, as, were, ten, out, of, eleven, studies, conducted, in, russia, a, 2011, assessment, of, the, quality, of, randomized, controlled, trials, on, traditional, chinese, medicine, including, acupuncture, concluded, that, the, methodological, quality, of, most, such, trials, including, randomization, experimental, control, and, blinding, was, generally, poor, particularly, for, trials, published, in, chinese, journals, though, the, quality, of, acupuncture, trials, was, better, than, the, trials, testing, traditional, chinese, medicine, remedies, the, study, also, found, that, trials, published, in, non, chinese, journals, tended, to, be, of, higher, quality, chinese, authors, use, more, chinese, studies, which, have, been, demonstrated, to, be, uniformly, positive, a, 2012, review, of, 88, systematic, reviews, of, acupuncture, published, in, chinese, journals, found, that, less, than, half, of, these, reviews, reported, testing, for, publication, bias, and, that, the, majority, of, these, reviews, were, published, in, journals, with, impact, factors, of, zero, a, 2015, study, comparing, pre, registered, records, of, acupuncture, trials, with, their, published, results, found, that, it, was, uncommon, for, such, trials, to, be, registered, before, the, trial, began, this, study, also, found, that, selective, reporting, of, results, and, changing, outcome, measures, to, obtain, statistically, significant, results, was, common, in, this, literature, scientist, and, journalist, steven, salzberg, identifies, acupuncture, and, chinese, medicine, generally, as, a, focus, for, fake, medical, journals, such, as, the, journal, of, acupuncture, and, meridian, studies, and, acupuncture, in, medicine, acupuncture, is, generally, safe, when, administered, by, an, experienced, appropriately, trained, practitioner, using, clean, needle, technique, and, sterile, single, use, needles, when, improperly, delivered, it, can, cause, adverse, effects, accidents, and, infections, are, associated, with, infractions, of, sterile, technique, or, neglect, on, the, part, of, the, practitioner, to, reduce, the, risk, of, serious, adverse, events, after, acupuncture, acupuncturists, should, be, trained, sufficiently, a, 2009, overview, of, cochrane, reviews, found, acupuncture, is, not, effective, for, a, wide, range, of, conditions, people, with, serious, spinal, disease, such, as, cancer, or, infection, are, not, good, candidates, for, acupuncture, contraindications, to, acupuncture, conditions, that, should, not, be, treated, with, acupuncture, include, coagulopathy, disorders, e, g, hemophilia, and, advanced, liver, disease, warfarin, use, severe, psychiatric, disorders, e, g, psychosis, and, skin, infections, or, skin, trauma, e, g, burns, further, electroacupuncture, should, be, avoided, at, the, spot, of, implanted, electrical, devices, such, as, pacemakers, a, 2011, systematic, review, of, systematic, reviews, internationally, and, without, language, restrictions, found, that, serious, complications, following, acupuncture, continue, to, be, reported, between, 2000, and, 2009, ninety, five, cases, of, serious, adverse, events, including, five, deaths, were, reported, many, such, events, are, not, inherent, to, acupuncture, but, are, due, to, malpractice, of, acupuncturists, this, might, be, why, such, complications, have, not, been, reported, in, surveys, of, adequately, trained, acupuncturists, most, such, reports, originate, from, asia, which, may, reflect, the, large, number, of, treatments, performed, there, or, a, relatively, higher, number, of, poorly, trained, asian, acupuncturists, many, serious, adverse, events, were, reported, from, developed, countries, these, included, australia, austria, canada, croatia, france, germany, ireland, the, netherlands, new, zealand, spain, sweden, switzerland, the, uk, and, the, us, the, number, of, adverse, effects, reported, from, the, uk, appears, particularly, unusual, which, may, indicate, less, under, reporting, in, the, uk, than, other, countries, reports, included, 38, cases, of, infections, and, 42, cases, of, organ, trauma, the, most, frequent, adverse, events, included, pneumothorax, and, bacterial, and, viral, infections, a, 2013, review, found, without, restrictions, regarding, publication, date, study, type, or, language, 295, cases, of, infections, mycobacterium, was, the, pathogen, in, at, least, 96, likely, sources, of, infection, include, towels, hot, packs, or, boiling, tank, water, and, reusing, reprocessed, needles, possible, sources, of, infection, include, contaminated, needles, reusing, personal, needles, a, person, s, skin, containing, mycobacterium, and, reusing, needles, at, various, sites, in, the, same, person, although, acupuncture, is, generally, considered, a, safe, procedure, a, 2013, review, stated, that, the, reports, of, infection, transmission, increased, significantly, in, the, prior, decade, including, those, of, mycobacterium, although, it, is, recommended, that, practitioners, of, acupuncture, use, disposable, needles, the, reuse, of, sterilized, needles, is, still, permitted, it, is, also, recommended, that, thorough, control, practices, for, preventing, infection, be, implemented, and, adapted, a, 2013, systematic, review, of, the, english, language, case, reports, found, that, serious, adverse, events, associated, with, acupuncture, are, rare, but, that, acupuncture, is, not, without, risk, between, 2000, and, 2011, the, english, language, literature, from, 25, countries, and, regions, reported, 294, adverse, events, the, majority, of, the, reported, adverse, events, were, relatively, minor, and, the, incidences, were, low, for, example, a, prospective, survey, of, 34, 000, acupuncture, treatments, found, no, serious, adverse, events, and, 43, minor, ones, a, rate, of, 1, 3, per, 1000, interventions, another, survey, found, there, were, 7, 1, minor, adverse, events, of, which, 5, were, serious, amid, 97, 733, acupuncture, patients, the, most, common, adverse, effect, observed, was, infection, e, g, mycobacterium, and, the, majority, of, infections, were, bacterial, in, nature, caused, by, skin, contact, at, the, needling, site, infection, has, also, resulted, from, skin, contact, with, unsterilized, equipment, or, with, dirty, towels, in, an, unhygienic, clinical, setting, other, adverse, complications, included, five, reported, cases, of, spinal, cord, injuries, e, g, migrating, broken, needles, or, needling, too, deeply, four, brain, injuries, four, peripheral, nerve, injuries, five, heart, injuries, seven, other, organ, and, tissue, injuries, bilateral, hand, edema, epithelioid, granuloma, pseudolymphoma, argyria, pustules, pancytopenia, and, scarring, due, to, hot, needle, technique, adverse, reactions, from, acupuncture, which, are, unusual, and, uncommon, in, typical, acupuncture, practice, included, syncope, galactorrhoea, bilateral, nystagmus, pyoderma, gangrenosum, hepatotoxicity, eruptive, lichen, planus, and, spontaneous, needle, migration, a, 2013, systematic, review, found, 31, cases, of, vascular, injuries, caused, by, acupuncture, three, causing, death, two, died, from, pericardial, tamponade, and, one, was, from, an, aortoduodenal, fistula, the, same, review, found, vascular, injuries, were, rare, bleeding, and, pseudoaneurysm, were, most, prevalent, a, 2011, systematic, review, without, restriction, in, time, or, language, aiming, to, summarize, all, reported, case, of, cardiac, tamponade, after, acupuncture, found, 26, cases, resulting, in, 14, deaths, with, little, doubt, about, cause, in, most, fatal, instances, the, same, review, concluded, that, cardiac, tamponade, was, a, serious, usually, fatal, though, theoretically, avoidable, complication, following, acupuncture, and, urged, training, to, minimize, risk, a, 2012, review, found, that, a, number, of, adverse, events, were, reported, after, acupuncture, in, the, uk, s, national, health, service, nhs, 95, of, which, were, not, severe, though, miscategorization, and, under, reporting, may, alter, the, total, figures, from, january, 2009, to, december, 2011, 468, safety, incidents, were, recognized, within, the, nhs, organizations, the, adverse, events, recorded, included, retained, needles, 31, dizziness, 30, loss, of, consciousness, unresponsive, 19, falls, 4, bruising, or, soreness, at, needle, site, 2, pneumothorax, 1, and, other, adverse, side, effects, 12, acupuncture, practitioners, should, know, and, be, prepared, to, be, responsible, for, any, substantial, harm, from, treatments, some, acupuncture, proponents, argue, that, the, long, history, of, acupuncture, suggests, it, is, safe, however, there, is, an, increasing, literature, on, adverse, events, e, g, spinal, cord, injury, acupuncture, seems, to, be, safe, in, people, getting, anticoagulants, assuming, needles, are, used, at, the, correct, location, and, depth, but, studies, are, required, to, verify, these, findings, a, 2010, systematic, review, of, the, chinese, language, literature, found, numerous, acupuncture, related, adverse, events, including, pneumothorax, fainting, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, and, infection, as, the, most, frequent, and, cardiovascular, injuries, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and, recurrent, cerebral, hemorrhage, as, the, most, serious, most, of, which, were, due, to, improper, technique, between, 1980, and, 2009, the, chinese, language, literature, reported, 479, adverse, events, prospective, surveys, show, that, mild, transient, acupuncture, associated, adverse, events, ranged, from, 6, 71, to, 15, in, a, study, with, 190, 924, patients, the, prevalence, of, serious, adverse, events, was, roughly, 0, 024, another, study, showed, a, rate, of, adverse, events, requiring, specific, treatment, of, 2, 2, 4, 963, incidences, among, 229, 230, patients, infections, mainly, hepatitis, after, acupuncture, are, reported, often, in, english, language, research, though, are, rarely, reported, in, chinese, language, research, making, it, plausible, that, acupuncture, associated, infections, have, been, underreported, in, china, infections, were, mostly, caused, by, poor, sterilization, of, acupuncture, needles, other, adverse, events, included, spinal, epidural, hematoma, in, the, cervical, thoracic, and, lumbar, spine, chylothorax, injuries, of, abdominal, organs, and, tissues, injuries, in, the, neck, region, injuries, to, the, eyes, including, orbital, hemorrhage, traumatic, cataract, injury, of, the, oculomotor, nerve, and, retinal, puncture, hemorrhage, to, the, cheeks, and, the, hypoglottis, peripheral, motor, nerve, injuries, and, subsequent, motor, dysfunction, local, allergic, reactions, to, metal, needles, stroke, and, cerebral, hemorrhage, after, acupuncture, a, causal, link, between, acupuncture, and, the, adverse, events, cardiac, arrest, pyknolepsy, shock, fever, cough, thirst, aphonia, leg, numbness, and, sexual, dysfunction, remains, uncertain, the, same, review, concluded, that, acupuncture, can, be, considered, inherently, safe, when, practiced, by, properly, trained, practitioners, but, the, review, also, stated, there, is, a, need, to, find, effective, strategies, to, minimize, the, health, risks, between, 1999, and, 2010, the, korean, language, literature, contained, reports, of, 1104, adverse, events, between, the, 1980s, and, 2002, the, japanese, language, literature, contained, reports, of, 150, adverse, events, although, acupuncture, has, been, practiced, for, thousands, of, years, in, china, its, use, in, pediatrics, in, the, united, states, did, not, become, common, until, the, early, 2000s, in, 2007, the, national, health, interview, survey, nhis, conducted, by, the, national, center, for, health, statistics, nchs, estimated, that, approximately, 150, 000, children, had, received, acupuncture, treatment, for, a, variety, of, conditions, in, 2008, a, study, determined, that, the, use, of, acupuncture, needle, treatment, on, children, was, questionable, due, to, the, possibility, of, adverse, side, effects, and, the, pain, manifestation, differences, in, children, versus, adults, the, study, also, includes, warnings, against, practicing, acupuncture, on, infants, as, well, as, on, children, who, are, over, fatigued, very, weak, or, have, over, eaten, when, used, on, children, acupuncture, is, considered, safe, when, administered, by, well, trained, licensed, practitioners, using, sterile, needles, however, a, 2011, review, found, there, was, limited, research, to, draw, definite, conclusions, about, the, overall, safety, of, pediatric, acupuncture, the, same, review, found, 279, adverse, events, 25, of, them, serious, the, adverse, events, were, mostly, mild, in, nature, e, g, bruising, or, bleeding, the, prevalence, of, mild, adverse, events, ranged, from, 10, 1, to, 13, 5, an, estimated, 168, incidences, among, 1, 422, patients, on, rare, occasions, adverse, events, were, serious, e, g, cardiac, rupture, or, hemoptysis, many, might, have, been, a, result, of, substandard, practice, the, incidence, of, serious, adverse, events, was, 5, per, one, million, which, included, children, and, adults, when, used, during, pregnancy, the, majority, of, adverse, events, caused, by, acupuncture, were, mild, and, transient, with, few, serious, adverse, events, the, most, frequent, mild, adverse, event, was, needling, or, unspecified, pain, followed, by, bleeding, although, two, deaths, one, stillbirth, and, one, neonatal, death, were, reported, there, was, a, lack, of, acupuncture, associated, maternal, mortality, limiting, the, evidence, as, certain, probable, or, possible, in, the, causality, evaluation, the, estimated, incidence, of, adverse, events, following, acupuncture, in, pregnant, women, was, 131, per, 10, 000, although, acupuncture, is, not, contraindicated, in, pregnant, women, some, specific, acupuncture, points, are, particularly, sensitive, to, needle, insertion, these, spots, as, well, as, the, abdominal, region, should, be, avoided, during, pregnancy, four, adverse, events, associated, with, moxibustion, were, bruising, burns, and, cellulitis, spinal, epidural, abscess, and, large, superficial, basal, cell, carcinoma, ten, adverse, events, were, associated, with, cupping, the, minor, ones, were, keloid, scarring, burns, and, bullae, the, serious, ones, were, acquired, hemophilia, a, stroke, following, cupping, on, the, back, and, neck, factitious, panniculitis, reversible, cardiac, hypertrophy, and, iron, deficiency, anemia, as, with, other, alternative, medicines, unethical, or, na, ve, practitioners, may, induce, patients, to, exhaust, financial, resources, by, pursuing, ineffective, treatment, professional, ethics, codes, set, by, accrediting, organizations, such, as, the, national, certification, commission, for, acupuncture, and, oriental, medicine, require, practitioners, to, make, timely, referrals, to, other, health, care, professionals, as, may, be, appropriate, stephen, barrett, states, that, there, is, a, risk, that, an, acupuncturist, whose, approach, to, diagnosis, is, not, based, on, scientific, concepts, will, fail, to, diagnose, a, dangerous, condition, acupuncture, is, a, substantial, part, of, traditional, chinese, medicine, tcm, early, acupuncture, beliefs, relied, on, concepts, that, are, common, in, tcm, such, as, a, life, force, energy, called, qi, qi, was, believed, to, flow, from, the, body, s, primary, organs, zang, fu, organs, to, the, superficial, body, tissues, of, the, skin, muscles, tendons, bones, and, joints, through, channels, called, meridians, acupuncture, points, where, needles, are, inserted, are, mainly, but, not, always, found, at, locations, along, the, meridians, acupuncture, points, not, found, along, a, meridian, are, called, extraordinary, points, and, those, with, no, designated, site, are, called, a, shi, points, in, tcm, disease, is, generally, perceived, as, a, disharmony, or, imbalance, in, energies, such, as, yin, yang, qi, xu, z, ng, f, meridians, and, of, the, interaction, between, the, body, and, the, environment, therapy, is, based, on, which, pattern, of, disharmony, can, be, identified, for, example, some, diseases, are, believed, to, be, caused, by, meridians, being, invaded, with, an, excess, of, wind, cold, and, damp, in, order, to, determine, which, pattern, is, at, hand, practitioners, examine, things, like, the, color, and, shape, of, the, tongue, the, relative, strength, of, pulse, points, the, smell, of, the, breath, the, quality, of, breathing, or, the, sound, of, the, voice, tcm, and, its, concept, of, disease, does, not, strongly, differentiate, between, the, cause, and, effect, of, symptoms, many, within, the, scientific, community, consider, acupuncture, to, be, quackery, and, pseudoscience, having, no, effect, other, than, as, theatrical, placebo, david, gorski, has, argued, that, of, all, forms, of, quackery, acupuncture, has, perhaps, gained, most, acceptance, among, physicians, and, institutions, academics, massimo, pigliucci, and, maarten, boudry, describe, acupuncture, as, a, borderlands, science, lying, between, science, and, pseudoscience, it, is, a, generally, held, belief, within, the, acupuncture, community, that, acupuncture, points, and, meridians, structures, are, special, conduits, for, electrical, signals, but, no, research, has, established, any, consistent, anatomical, structure, or, function, for, either, acupuncture, points, or, meridians, human, tests, to, determine, whether, electrical, continuity, was, significantly, different, near, meridians, than, other, places, in, the, body, have, been, inconclusive, scientific, research, has, not, supported, the, existence, of, qi, meridians, or, yin, and, yang, a, nature, editorial, described, tcm, as, fraught, with, pseudoscience, with, the, majority, of, its, treatments, having, no, logical, mechanism, of, action, quackwatch, states, that, tcm, theory, and, practice, are, not, based, upon, the, body, of, knowledge, related, to, health, disease, and, health, care, that, has, been, widely, accepted, by, the, scientific, community, tcm, practitioners, disagree, among, themselves, about, how, to, diagnose, patients, and, which, treatments, should, go, with, which, diagnoses, even, if, they, could, agree, the, tcm, theories, are, so, nebulous, that, no, amount, of, scientific, study, will, enable, tcm, to, offer, rational, care, academic, discussions, of, acupuncture, still, make, reference, to, pseudoscientific, concepts, such, as, qi, and, meridians, despite, the, lack, of, scientific, evidence, some, modern, practitioners, support, the, use, of, acupuncture, to, treat, pain, but, have, abandoned, the, use, of, qi, meridians, yin, yang, and, other, mystical, energies, as, an, explanatory, frameworks, the, use, of, qi, as, an, explanatory, framework, has, been, decreasing, in, china, even, as, it, becomes, more, prominent, during, discussions, of, acupuncture, in, the, us, many, acupuncturists, attribute, pain, relief, to, the, release, of, endorphins, when, needles, penetrate, but, no, longer, support, the, idea, that, acupuncture, can, affect, a, disease, some, studies, suggest, acupuncture, causes, a, series, of, events, within, the, central, nervous, system, and, that, it, is, possible, to, inhibit, acupuncture, s, analgesic, effects, with, the, opioid, antagonist, naloxone, mechanical, deformation, of, the, skin, by, acupuncture, needles, appears, to, result, in, the, release, of, adenosine, the, anti, nociceptive, effect, of, acupuncture, may, be, mediated, by, the, adenosine, a1, receptor, a, 2014, review, in, nature, reviews, cancer, analyzed, mouse, studies, that, suggested, acupuncture, relieves, pain, via, the, local, release, of, adenosine, which, then, triggered, nearby, a1, receptors, the, review, found, that, in, those, studies, because, acupuncture, caused, more, tissue, damage, and, inflammation, relative, to, the, size, of, the, animal, in, mice, than, in, humans, such, studies, unnecessarily, muddled, a, finding, that, local, inflammation, can, result, in, the, local, release, of, adenosine, with, analgesic, effect, acupuncture, along, with, moxibustion, is, one, of, the, oldest, practices, of, traditional, chinese, medicine, most, historians, believe, the, practice, began, in, china, though, there, are, some, conflicting, narratives, on, when, it, originated, academics, david, ramey, and, paul, buell, said, the, exact, date, acupuncture, was, founded, depends, on, the, extent, to, which, dating, of, ancient, texts, can, be, trusted, and, the, interpretation, of, what, constitutes, acupuncture, acupressure, therapy, was, prevalent, in, india, once, buddhism, spread, to, china, the, acupressure, therapy, was, also, integrated, into, common, medical, practice, in, china, and, it, came, to, be, known, as, acupuncture, the, major, points, of, indian, acupressure, and, chinese, acupuncture, are, similar, to, each, other, according, to, an, article, in, rheumatology, the, first, documentation, of, an, organized, system, of, diagnosis, and, treatment, for, acupuncture, was, in, inner, classic, of, huang, di, huangdi, neijing, from, about, 100, bc, gold, and, silver, needles, found, in, the, tomb, of, liu, sheng, from, around, 100, bc, are, believed, to, be, the, earliest, archaeological, evidence, of, acupuncture, though, it, is, unclear, if, that, was, their, purpose, according, to, plinio, prioreschi, the, earliest, known, historical, record, of, acupuncture, is, the, shiji, records, of, the, grand, historian, written, by, a, historian, around, 100, bc, it, is, believed, that, this, text, was, documenting, what, was, established, practice, at, that, time, the, 5, 000, year, old, mummified, body, of, tzi, the, iceman, was, found, with, 15, groups, of, tattoos, many, of, which, were, located, at, points, on, the, body, where, acupuncture, needles, are, used, for, abdominal, or, lower, back, problems, evidence, from, the, body, suggests, tzi, had, these, conditions, this, has, been, cited, as, evidence, that, practices, similar, to, acupuncture, may, have, been, practised, elsewhere, in, eurasia, during, the, early, bronze, age, however, the, oxford, handbook, of, the, history, of, medicine, calls, this, theory, speculative, it, is, considered, unlikely, that, acupuncture, was, practised, before, 2000, bc, acupuncture, may, have, been, practised, during, the, neolithic, era, near, the, end, of, the, stone, age, using, sharpened, stones, called, bian, shi, 70, many, chinese, texts, from, later, eras, refer, to, sharp, stones, called, plen, which, means, stone, probe, that, may, have, been, used, for, acupuncture, purposes, 70, the, ancient, chinese, medical, text, huangdi, neijing, indicates, that, sharp, stones, were, believed, at, the, time, to, cure, illnesses, at, or, near, the, body, s, surface, perhaps, because, of, the, short, depth, a, stone, could, penetrate, 71, however, it, is, more, likely, that, stones, were, used, for, other, medical, purposes, such, as, puncturing, a, growth, to, drain, its, pus, the, mawangdui, texts, which, are, believed, to, be, from, the, 2nd, century, bc, mention, the, use, of, pointed, stones, to, open, abscesses, and, moxibustion, but, not, for, acupuncture, it, is, also, speculated, that, these, stones, may, have, been, used, for, bloodletting, due, to, the, ancient, chinese, belief, that, illnesses, were, caused, by, demons, within, the, body, that, could, be, killed, or, released, it, is, likely, bloodletting, was, an, antecedent, to, acupuncture, according, to, historians, lu, gwei, djen, and, joseph, needham, there, is, substantial, evidence, that, acupuncture, may, have, begun, around, 600, bc, some, hieroglyphs, and, pictographs, from, that, era, suggests, acupuncture, and, moxibustion, were, practised, however, historians, lu, and, needham, said, it, was, unlikely, a, needle, could, be, made, out, of, the, materials, available, in, china, during, this, time, period, 71, 72, it, is, possible, that, bronze, was, used, for, early, acupuncture, needles, tin, copper, gold, and, silver, are, also, possibilities, though, they, are, considered, less, likely, or, to, have, been, used, in, fewer, cases, 69, if, acupuncture, was, practised, during, the, shang, dynasty, 1766, to, 1122, bc, organic, materials, like, thorns, sharpened, bones, or, bamboo, may, have, been, used, 70, once, methods, for, producing, steel, were, discovered, it, would, replace, all, other, materials, since, it, could, be, used, to, create, a, very, fine, but, sturdy, needle, 74, lu, and, needham, noted, that, all, the, ancient, materials, that, could, have, been, used, for, acupuncture, and, which, often, produce, archaeological, evidence, such, as, sharpened, bones, bamboo, or, stones, were, also, used, for, other, purposes, an, article, in, rheumatology, said, that, the, absence, of, any, mention, of, acupuncture, in, documents, found, in, the, tomb, of, mawangdui, from, 198, bc, suggest, that, acupuncture, was, not, practised, by, that, time, several, different, and, sometimes, conflicting, belief, systems, emerged, regarding, acupuncture, this, may, have, been, the, result, of, competing, schools, of, thought, some, ancient, texts, referred, to, using, acupuncture, to, cause, bleeding, while, others, mixed, the, ideas, of, blood, letting, and, spiritual, ch, i, energy, over, time, the, focus, shifted, from, blood, to, the, concept, of, puncturing, specific, points, on, the, body, and, eventually, to, balancing, yin, and, yang, energies, as, well, according, to, david, ramey, no, single, method, or, theory, was, ever, predominantly, adopted, as, the, standard, at, the, time, scientific, knowledge, of, medicine, was, not, yet, developed, especially, because, in, china, dissection, of, the, deceased, was, forbidden, preventing, the, development, of, basic, anatomical, knowledge, it, is, not, certain, when, specific, acupuncture, points, were, introduced, but, the, autobiography, of, bian, que, from, around, 400, 500, bc, references, inserting, needles, at, designated, areas, bian, que, believed, there, was, a, single, acupuncture, point, at, the, top, of, one, s, skull, that, he, called, the, point, of, the, hundred, meetings, 83, texts, dated, to, be, from, 156, to, 186, bc, document, early, beliefs, in, channels, of, life, force, energy, called, meridians, that, would, later, be, an, element, in, early, acupuncture, beliefs, ramey, and, buell, said, the, practice, and, theoretical, underpinnings, of, modern, acupuncture, were, introduced, in, the, yellow, emperor, s, classic, huangdi, neijing, around, 100, bc, it, introduced, the, concept, of, using, acupuncture, to, manipulate, the, flow, of, life, energy, qi, in, a, network, of, meridian, channels, in, the, body, the, network, concept, was, made, up, of, acu, tracts, such, as, a, line, down, the, arms, where, it, said, acupoints, were, located, some, of, the, sites, acupuncturists, use, needles, at, today, still, have, the, same, names, as, those, given, to, them, by, the, yellow, emperor, s, classic, 93, numerous, additional, documents, were, published, over, the, centuries, introducing, new, acupoints, 101, by, the, 4th, century, ad, most, of, the, acupuncture, sites, in, use, today, had, been, named, and, identified, 101, in, the, first, half, of, the, 1st, century, ad, acupuncturists, began, promoting, the, belief, that, acupuncture, s, effectiveness, was, influenced, by, the, time, of, day, or, night, the, lunar, cycle, and, the, season, 140, 41, the, science, of, the, yin, yang, cycles, y, n, q, xu, was, a, set, of, beliefs, that, curing, diseases, relied, on, the, alignment, of, both, heavenly, tian, and, earthly, di, forces, that, were, attuned, to, cycles, like, that, of, the, sun, and, moon, 140, 41, there, were, several, different, belief, systems, that, relied, on, a, number, of, celestial, and, earthly, bodies, or, elements, that, rotated, and, only, became, aligned, at, certain, times, 140, 41, according, to, needham, and, lu, these, arbitrary, predictions, were, depicted, by, acupuncturists, in, complex, charts, and, through, a, set, of, special, terminology, acupuncture, needles, during, this, period, were, much, thicker, than, most, modern, ones, and, often, resulted, in, infection, infection, is, caused, by, a, lack, of, sterilization, but, at, that, time, it, was, believed, to, be, caused, by, use, of, the, wrong, needle, or, needling, in, the, wrong, place, or, at, the, wrong, time, 102, 03, later, many, needles, were, heated, in, boiling, water, or, in, a, flame, sometimes, needles, were, used, while, they, were, still, hot, creating, a, cauterizing, effect, at, the, injection, site, 104, nine, needles, were, recommended, in, the, great, compendium, of, acupuncture, and, moxibustion, from, 1601, which, may, have, been, because, of, an, ancient, chinese, belief, that, nine, was, a, magic, number, 102, 03, other, belief, systems, were, based, on, the, idea, that, the, human, body, operated, on, a, rhythm, and, acupuncture, had, to, be, applied, at, the, right, point, in, the, rhythm, to, be, effective, 140, 41, in, some, cases, a, lack, of, balance, between, yin, and, yang, were, believed, to, be, the, cause, of, disease, 140, 41, in, the, 1st, century, ad, many, of, the, first, books, about, acupuncture, were, published, and, recognized, acupuncturist, experts, began, to, emerge, the, zhen, jiu, jia, yi, jing, which, was, published, in, the, mid, 3rd, century, became, the, oldest, acupuncture, book, that, is, still, in, existence, in, the, modern, era, other, books, like, the, yu, gui, zhen, jing, written, by, the, director, of, medical, services, for, china, were, also, influential, during, this, period, but, were, not, preserved, in, the, mid, 7th, century, sun, simiao, published, acupuncture, related, diagrams, and, charts, that, established, standardized, methods, for, finding, acupuncture, sites, on, people, of, different, sizes, and, categorized, acupuncture, sites, in, a, set, of, modules, acupuncture, became, more, established, in, china, as, improvements, in, paper, led, to, the, publication, of, more, acupuncture, books, the, imperial, medical, service, and, the, imperial, medical, college, which, both, supported, acupuncture, became, more, established, and, created, medical, colleges, in, every, province, 129, the, public, was, also, exposed, to, stories, about, royal, figures, being, cured, of, their, diseases, by, prominent, acupuncturists, 129, 35, by, time, the, great, compendium, of, acupuncture, and, moxibustion, was, published, during, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, ad, most, of, the, acupuncture, practices, used, in, the, modern, era, had, been, established, by, the, end, of, the, song, dynasty, 1279, ad, acupuncture, had, lost, much, of, its, status, in, china, 25, it, became, rarer, in, the, following, centuries, and, was, associated, with, less, prestigious, professions, like, alchemy, shamanism, midwifery, and, moxibustion, 25, additionally, by, the, 18th, century, scientific, rationality, was, becoming, more, popular, than, traditional, superstitious, beliefs, by, 1757, a, book, documenting, the, history, of, chinese, medicine, called, acupuncture, a, lost, art, 160, its, decline, was, attributed, in, part, to, the, popularity, of, prescriptions, and, medications, as, well, as, its, association, with, the, lower, classes, 188, in, 1822, the, chinese, emperor, signed, a, decree, excluding, the, practice, of, acupuncture, from, the, imperial, medical, institute, he, said, it, was, unfit, for, practice, by, gentlemen, scholars, 308, in, china, acupuncture, was, increasingly, associated, with, lower, class, illiterate, practitioners, 58, it, was, restored, for, a, time, but, banned, again, in, 1929, in, favor, of, science, based, medicine, although, acupuncture, declined, in, china, during, this, time, period, it, was, also, growing, in, popularity, in, other, countries, korea, is, believed, to, be, the, first, country, in, asia, that, acupuncture, spread, to, outside, of, china, within, korea, there, is, a, legend, that, acupuncture, was, developed, by, emperor, dangun, though, it, is, more, likely, to, have, been, brought, into, korea, from, a, chinese, colonial, prefecture, in, 514, ad, 262, 63, acupuncture, use, was, commonplace, in, korea, by, the, 6th, century, it, spread, to, vietnam, in, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, as, vietnam, began, trading, with, japan, and, china, around, the, 9th, century, it, was, influenced, by, their, acupuncture, practices, as, well, china, and, korea, sent, medical, missionaries, that, spread, traditional, chinese, medicine, to, japan, starting, around, 219, ad, in, 553, several, korean, and, chinese, citizens, were, appointed, to, re, organize, medical, education, in, japan, and, they, incorporated, acupuncture, as, part, of, that, system, 264, japan, later, sent, students, back, to, china, and, established, acupuncture, as, one, of, five, divisions, of, the, chinese, state, medical, administration, system, 264, 65, acupuncture, began, to, spread, to, europe, in, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, around, this, time, the, surgeon, general, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, met, japanese, and, chinese, acupuncture, practitioners, and, later, encouraged, europeans, to, further, investigate, it, 264, 65, he, published, the, first, in, depth, description, of, acupuncture, for, the, european, audience, and, created, the, term, acupuncture, in, his, 1683, work, de, acupunctura, france, was, an, early, adopter, among, the, west, due, to, the, influence, of, jesuit, missionaries, who, brought, the, practice, to, french, clinics, in, the, 16th, century, the, french, doctor, louis, berlioz, the, father, of, the, composer, hector, berlioz, is, usually, credited, with, being, the, first, to, experiment, with, the, procedure, in, europe, in, 1810, before, publishing, his, findings, in, 1816, 308, by, the, 19th, century, acupuncture, had, become, commonplace, in, many, areas, of, the, world, 295, americans, and, britons, began, showing, interest, in, acupuncture, in, the, early, 19th, century, although, interest, waned, by, mid, century, western, practitioners, abandoned, acupuncture, s, traditional, beliefs, in, spiritual, energy, pulse, diagnosis, and, the, cycles, of, the, moon, sun, or, the, body, s, rhythm, diagrams, of, the, flow, of, spiritual, energy, for, example, conflicted, with, the, west, s, own, anatomical, diagrams, it, adopted, a, new, set, of, ideas, for, acupuncture, based, on, tapping, needles, into, nerves, in, europe, it, was, speculated, that, acupuncture, may, allow, or, prevent, the, flow, of, electricity, in, the, body, as, electrical, pulses, were, found, to, make, a, frog, s, leg, twitch, after, death, the, west, eventually, created, a, belief, system, based, on, travell, trigger, points, that, were, believed, to, inhibit, pain, they, were, in, the, same, locations, as, china, s, spiritually, identified, acupuncture, points, but, under, a, different, nomenclature, the, first, elaborate, western, treatise, on, acupuncture, was, published, in, 1683, by, willem, ten, rhijne, 75, in, china, the, popularity, of, acupuncture, rebounded, in, 1949, when, mao, zedong, took, power, and, sought, to, unite, china, behind, traditional, cultural, values, it, was, also, during, this, time, that, many, eastern, medical, practices, were, consolidated, under, the, name, traditional, chinese, medicine, tcm, new, practices, were, adopted, in, the, 20th, century, such, as, using, a, cluster, of, needles, 164, electrified, needles, or, leaving, needles, inserted, for, up, to, a, week, 164, a, lot, of, emphasis, developed, on, using, acupuncture, on, the, ear, 164, acupuncture, research, organizations, such, as, the, international, society, of, acupuncture, were, founded, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, and, acupuncture, services, became, available, in, modern, hospitals, china, where, acupuncture, was, believed, to, have, originated, was, increasingly, influenced, by, western, medicine, meanwhile, acupuncture, grew, in, popularity, in, the, us, the, us, congress, created, the, office, of, alternative, medicine, in, 1992, and, the, national, institutes, of, health, nih, declared, support, for, acupuncture, for, some, conditions, in, november, 1997, in, 1999, the, national, center, for, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, was, created, within, the, nih, acupuncture, became, the, most, popular, alternative, medicine, in, the, us, politicians, from, the, chinese,
