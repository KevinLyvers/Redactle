a, shrimp, pl, shrimp, us, or, shrimps, uk, is, a, crustacean, a, form, of, shellfish, with, an, elongated, body, and, a, primarily, swimming, mode, of, locomotion, typically, belonging, to, the, caridea, or, dendrobranchiata, of, the, order, decapoda, although, some, crustaceans, outside, of, this, order, are, also, referred, to, as, shrimp, more, narrow, definitions, may, be, restricted, to, caridea, to, smaller, species, of, either, group, or, to, only, the, marine, species, under, a, broader, definition, shrimp, may, be, synonymous, with, prawn, covering, stalk, eyed, swimming, crustaceans, with, long, narrow, muscular, tails, abdomens, long, whiskers, antennae, and, slender, legs, any, small, crustacean, which, resembles, a, shrimp, tends, to, be, called, one, they, swim, forward, by, paddling, with, swimmerets, on, the, underside, of, their, abdomens, although, their, escape, response, is, typically, repeated, flicks, with, the, tail, driving, them, backwards, very, quickly, crabs, and, lobsters, have, strong, walking, legs, whereas, shrimp, have, thin, fragile, legs, which, they, use, primarily, for, perching, shrimp, are, widespread, and, abundant, there, are, thousands, of, species, adapted, to, a, wide, range, of, habitats, they, can, be, found, feeding, near, the, seafloor, on, most, coasts, and, estuaries, as, well, as, in, rivers, and, lakes, to, escape, predators, some, species, flip, off, the, seafloor, and, dive, into, the, sediment, they, usually, live, from, one, to, seven, years, shrimp, are, often, solitary, though, they, can, form, large, schools, during, the, spawning, season, they, play, important, roles, in, the, food, chain, and, are, an, important, food, source, for, larger, animals, ranging, from, fish, to, whales, the, muscular, tails, of, many, shrimp, are, edible, to, humans, and, they, are, widely, caught, and, farmed, for, human, consumption, commercial, shrimp, species, support, an, industry, worth, 50, billion, dollars, a, year, and, in, 2010, the, total, commercial, production, of, shrimp, was, nearly, 7, million, tonnes, shrimp, farming, became, more, prevalent, during, the, 1980s, particularly, in, china, and, by, 2007, the, harvest, from, shrimp, farms, exceeded, the, capture, of, wild, shrimp, there, are, significant, issues, with, excessive, bycatch, when, shrimp, are, captured, in, the, wild, and, with, pollution, damage, done, to, estuaries, when, they, are, used, to, support, shrimp, farming, many, shrimp, species, are, small, as, the, term, shrimp, suggests, about, 2, cm, 0, 79, in, long, but, some, shrimp, exceed, 25, cm, 9, 8, in, larger, shrimp, are, more, likely, to, be, targeted, commercially, and, are, often, referred, to, as, prawns, particularly, in, the, commonwealth, of, nations, and, former, british, colonies, from, raymond, bauer, in, remarkable, shrimps, from, the, english, oxford, dictionaries, shrimp, are, swimming, crustaceans, with, long, narrow, muscular, abdomens, and, long, antennae, unlike, crabs, and, lobsters, shrimp, have, well, developed, pleopods, swimmerets, and, slender, walking, legs, they, are, more, adapted, for, swimming, than, walking, historically, it, was, the, distinction, between, walking, and, swimming, that, formed, the, primary, taxonomic, division, into, the, former, suborders, natantia, and, reptantia, members, of, the, natantia, shrimp, in, the, broader, sense, were, adapted, for, swimming, while, the, reptantia, crabs, lobsters, etc, were, adapted, for, crawling, or, walking, some, other, groups, also, have, common, names, that, include, the, word, shrimp, any, small, swimming, crustacean, resembling, a, shrimp, tends, to, be, called, one, the, following, description, refers, mainly, to, the, external, anatomy, of, the, common, european, shrimp, crangon, crangon, as, a, typical, example, of, a, decapod, shrimp, the, body, of, the, shrimp, is, divided, into, two, main, parts, the, head, and, thorax, which, are, fused, together, to, form, the, cephalothorax, and, a, long, narrow, abdomen, the, shell, which, protects, the, cephalothorax, is, harder, and, thicker, than, the, shell, elsewhere, on, the, shrimp, and, is, called, the, carapace, the, carapace, typically, surrounds, the, gills, through, which, water, is, pumped, by, the, action, of, the, mouthparts, the, rostrum, eyes, whiskers, and, legs, also, issue, from, the, carapace, the, rostrum, from, the, latin, r, strum, meaning, beak, looks, like, a, beak, or, pointed, nose, at, the, front, of, the, shrimp, s, head, it, is, a, rigid, forward, extension, of, the, carapace, and, can, be, used, for, attack, or, defense, it, may, also, stabilize, the, shrimp, when, it, swims, backward, two, bulbous, eyes, on, stalks, sit, either, side, of, the, rostrum, these, are, compound, eyes, which, have, panoramic, vision, and, are, very, good, at, detecting, movement, two, pairs, of, whiskers, antennae, also, issue, from, the, head, one, of, these, pairs, is, very, long, and, can, be, twice, the, length, of, the, shrimp, while, the, other, pair, is, quite, short, the, antennae, have, sensors, on, them, which, allow, the, shrimp, to, feel, where, they, touch, and, also, allow, them, to, smell, or, taste, things, by, sampling, the, chemicals, in, the, water, the, long, antennae, help, the, shrimp, orient, itself, with, regard, to, its, immediate, surroundings, while, the, short, antennae, help, assess, the, suitability, of, prey, eight, pairs, of, appendages, issue, from, the, cephalothorax, the, first, three, pairs, the, maxillipeds, latin, for, jaw, feet, are, used, as, mouthparts, in, crangon, crangon, the, first, pair, the, maxillula, pumps, water, into, the, gill, cavity, after, the, maxilliped, come, five, more, pairs, of, appendages, the, pereiopods, these, form, the, ten, decapod, legs, in, crangon, crangon, the, first, two, pairs, of, pereiopods, have, claws, or, chela, the, chela, can, grasp, food, items, and, bring, them, to, the, mouth, they, can, also, be, used, for, fighting, and, grooming, the, remaining, four, legs, are, long, and, slender, and, are, used, for, walking, or, perching, the, muscular, abdomen, has, six, segments, and, has, a, thinner, shell, than, the, carapace, each, segment, has, a, separate, overlapping, shell, which, can, be, transparent, the, first, five, segments, each, have, a, pair, of, appendages, on, the, underside, which, are, shaped, like, paddles, and, are, used, for, swimming, forward, the, appendages, are, called, pleopods, or, swimmerets, and, can, be, used, for, purposes, other, than, swimming, some, shrimp, species, use, them, for, brooding, eggs, others, have, gills, on, them, for, breathing, and, the, males, in, some, species, use, the, first, pair, or, two, for, insemination, the, sixth, segment, terminates, in, the, telson, flanked, by, two, pairs, of, appendages, called, the, uropods, the, uropods, allow, the, shrimp, to, swim, backward, and, function, like, rudders, steering, the, shrimp, when, it, swims, forward, together, the, telson, and, uropods, form, a, splayed, tail, fan, if, a, shrimp, is, alarmed, it, can, flex, its, tail, fan, in, a, rapid, movement, this, results, in, a, backward, dart, called, the, caridoid, escape, reaction, lobstering, shrimp, are, widespread, and, can, be, found, near, the, seafloor, of, most, coasts, and, estuaries, as, well, as, in, rivers, and, lakes, there, are, numerous, species, and, usually, there, is, a, species, adapted, to, any, particular, habitat, most, shrimp, species, are, marine, although, about, a, quarter, of, the, described, species, are, found, in, fresh, water, marine, species, are, found, at, depths, of, up, to, 5, 000, metres, 16, 000, ft, and, from, the, tropics, to, the, polar, regions, although, shrimp, are, almost, entirely, fully, aquatic, the, two, species, of, merguia, are, semi, terrestrial, and, spend, a, significant, part, of, their, life, on, land, in, mangrove, there, are, many, variations, in, the, ways, different, types, of, shrimp, look, and, behave, even, within, the, core, group, of, caridean, shrimp, the, small, delicate, pederson, s, shrimp, above, looks, and, behaves, quite, unlike, the, large, commercial, pink, shrimp, or, the, snapping, pistol, shrimp, the, caridean, family, of, pistol, shrimp, are, characterized, by, big, asymmetrical, claws, the, larger, of, which, can, produce, a, loud, snapping, sound, the, family, is, diverse, and, worldwide, in, distribution, consisting, of, about, 600, species, colonies, of, snapping, shrimp, are, a, major, source, of, noise, in, the, ocean, and, can, interfere, with, sonar, and, underwater, communication, the, small, emperor, shrimp, has, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, sea, slugs, and, sea, cucumbers, and, may, help, keep, them, clear, of, ectoparasites, most, shrimp, are, omnivorous, but, some, are, specialised, for, particular, modes, of, feeding, some, are, filter, feeders, using, their, setose, bristly, legs, as, a, sieve, some, scrape, algae, from, rocks, cleaner, shrimp, feed, on, the, parasites, and, necrotic, tissue, of, the, reef, fish, they, groom, some, species, of, shrimp, are, known, to, cannibalize, others, as, well, if, other, food, sources, are, not, readily, available, in, turn, shrimp, are, eaten, by, various, animals, particularly, fish, and, seabirds, and, frequently, host, bopyrid, parasites, females, of, the, freshwater, shrimp, caridina, ensifera, are, capable, of, storing, sperm, from, multiple, partners, and, thus, can, produce, progeny, with, different, paternities, reproductive, success, of, sires, was, found, to, correlate, inversely, with, their, genetic, relatedness, to, the, mother, this, finding, suggests, that, sperm, competition, and, or, pre, and, post, copulatory, female, choice, occurs, female, choice, may, increase, the, fitness, of, progeny, by, reducing, inbreeding, depression, that, ordinarily, results, from, the, expression, of, homozygous, deleterious, recessive, mutations, there, is, little, agreement, among, taxonomists, concerning, the, phylogeny, of, crustaceans, within, the, decapods, every, study, gives, totally, different, results, nor, do, even, one, of, these, studies, match, any, of, the, rival, morphology, studies, some, taxonomists, identify, shrimp, with, the, infraorder, caridea, and, prawns, with, the, suborder, dendrobranchiata, while, different, experts, give, different, answers, there, is, no, disagreement, that, the, caridean, species, are, shrimp, there, are, over, 3000, caridean, species, occasionally, they, are, referred, to, as, true, shrimp, traditionally, decapods, were, divided, into, two, suborders, the, natantia, or, swimmers, and, the, reptantia, or, walkers, the, natantia, or, swimmers, included, the, shrimp, they, were, defined, by, their, abdomen, which, together, with, its, appendages, was, well, adapted, for, swimming, the, reptantia, or, walkers, included, the, crabs, and, lobsters, these, species, have, small, abdominal, appendages, but, robust, legs, well, adapted, for, walking, the, natantia, was, thought, to, be, paraphyletic, that, is, it, was, thought, that, originally, all, decapods, were, like, shrimp, however, classifications, are, now, based, on, clades, and, the, paraphyletic, suborder, natantia, has, been, discontinued, on, this, basis, taxonomic, classifications, now, divide, the, order, decapoda, into, the, two, suborders, dendrobranchiata, for, the, largest, shrimp, clade, and, pleocyemata, for, all, other, decapods, the, pleocyemata, are, in, turn, divided, into, half, a, dozen, infra, orders, a, particularly, significant, family, in, this, suborder, is, the, penaeidae, often, referred, to, as, penaeid, shrimp, or, penaeid, prawn, most, commercially, important, species, are, in, this, family, see, below, other, decapod, crustaceans, also, called, shrimp, are, the, ghost, or, mud, shrimp, belonging, to, the, infra, order, thalassinidea, in, australia, they, are, called, yabbies, the, monophyly, of, the, group, is, not, certain, recent, studies, have, suggested, dividing, the, group, into, two, infraorders, gebiidea, and, axiidea, a, shrimp, seems, to, be, almost, any, crustacean, that, isn, t, a, lobster, barnacle, or, crab, greg, jensen, a, wide, variety, of, non, decapod, crustaceans, are, also, commonly, referred, to, as, shrimp, this, includes, the, brine, shrimp, clam, shrimp, fairy, shrimp, and, tadpole, shrimp, belonging, to, the, branchiopods, the, lophogastridan, shrimp, opossum, shrimp, and, skeleton, shrimp, belonging, the, malacostraca, and, seed, shrimp, which, are, ostracods, many, of, these, species, look, quite, unlike, the, commercial, decapod, shrimp, that, are, eaten, as, seafood, for, example, skeleton, shrimp, have, short, legs, and, a, slender, tail, like, a, scorpion, tail, fairy, shrimp, swim, upside, down, with, swimming, appendages, that, look, like, leaves, and, the, tiny, seed, shrimp, have, bivalved, carapaces, which, they, can, open, or, close, krill, resemble, miniature, shrimp, and, are, sometimes, called, krill, shrimp, some, mantis, shrimp, are, a, foot, long, and, have, bulging, eyes, a, flattened, tail, and, formidable, claws, equipped, with, clubs, or, sharp, spikes, which, it, can, use, to, knock, out, its, opponents, in, 1991, archeologists, suggested, that, ancient, raised, paved, areas, near, the, coast, in, chiapas, mexico, were, platforms, used, for, drying, shrimp, in, the, sun, and, that, adjacent, clay, hearths, were, used, to, dry, the, shrimp, when, there, was, no, sun, the, evidence, was, circumstantial, because, the, chitinous, shells, of, shrimp, are, so, thin, they, degrade, rapidly, leaving, no, fossil, remains, in, 1985, quitmyer, and, others, found, direct, evidence, dating, back, to, 600, ad, for, shrimping, off, the, southeastern, coast, of, north, america, by, successfully, identifying, shrimp, from, the, archaeological, remains, of, their, mandibles, jaws, clay, vessels, with, shrimp, decorations, have, been, found, in, the, ruins, of, pompeii, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, the, greek, author, athenaeus, wrote, in, his, literary, work, deipnosophistae, of, all, fish, the, daintiest, is, a, young, shrimp, in, fig, leaves, in, north, america, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, captured, shrimp, and, other, crustaceans, in, fishing, weirs, and, traps, made, from, branches, and, spanish, moss, or, used, nets, woven, with, fibre, beaten, from, plants, at, the, same, time, early, european, settlers, oblivious, to, the, protein, rich, coasts, all, about, them, starved, from, lack, of, protein, in, 1735, beach, seines, were, imported, from, france, and, cajun, fishermen, in, louisiana, started, catching, white, shrimp, and, drying, them, in, the, sun, as, they, still, do, today, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, chinese, immigrants, arrived, for, the, california, gold, rush, many, from, the, pearl, river, delta, where, netting, small, shrimp, had, been, a, tradition, for, centuries, some, immigrants, starting, catching, shrimp, local, to, san, francisco, bay, particularly, the, small, inch, long, crangon, franciscorum, these, shrimp, burrow, into, the, sand, to, hide, and, can, be, present, in, high, numbers, without, appearing, to, be, so, the, catch, was, dried, in, the, sun, and, was, exported, to, china, or, sold, to, the, chinese, community, in, the, united, states, this, was, the, beginning, of, the, american, shrimping, industry, overfishing, and, pollution, from, gold, mine, tailings, resulted, in, the, decline, of, the, fishery, it, was, replaced, by, a, penaeid, white, shrimp, fishery, on, the, south, atlantic, and, gulf, coasts, these, shrimp, were, so, abundant, that, beaches, were, piled, with, windrows, from, their, moults, modern, industrial, shrimping, methods, originated, in, this, area, for, shrimp, to, develop, into, one, of, the, world, s, most, popular, foods, it, took, the, simultaneous, development, of, the, otter, trawl, and, the, internal, combustion, engine, shrimp, trawling, can, capture, shrimp, in, huge, volumes, by, dragging, a, net, along, the, seafloor, trawling, was, first, recorded, in, england, in, 1376, when, king, edward, iii, received, a, request, that, he, ban, this, new, and, destructive, way, of, fishing, in, 1583, the, dutch, banned, shrimp, trawling, in, estuaries, in, the, 1920s, diesel, engines, were, adapted, for, use, in, shrimp, boats, power, winches, were, connected, to, the, engines, and, only, small, crews, were, needed, to, rapidly, lift, heavy, nets, on, board, and, empty, them, shrimp, boats, became, larger, faster, and, more, capable, new, fishing, grounds, could, be, explored, trawls, could, be, deployed, in, deeper, offshore, waters, and, shrimp, could, be, tracked, and, caught, round, the, year, instead, of, seasonally, as, in, earlier, times, larger, boats, trawled, offshore, and, smaller, boats, worked, bays, and, estuaries, by, the, 1960s, steel, and, fibreglass, hulls, further, strengthened, shrimp, boats, so, they, could, trawl, heavier, nets, and, steady, advances, in, electronics, radar, sonar, and, gps, resulted, in, more, sophisticated, and, capable, shrimp, fleets, as, shrimp, fishing, methods, industrialised, parallel, changes, were, happening, in, the, way, shrimp, were, processed, in, the, 19th, century, sun, dried, shrimp, were, largely, replaced, by, canneries, in, the, 20th, century, the, canneries, were, replaced, with, freezers, in, the, 1970s, significant, shrimp, farming, was, initiated, particularly, in, china, the, farming, accelerated, during, the, 1980s, as, the, quantity, of, shrimp, demand, exceeded, the, quantity, supplied, and, as, excessive, bycatch, and, threats, to, endangered, sea, turtles, became, associated, with, trawling, for, wild, shrimp, in, 2007, the, production, of, farmed, shrimp, exceeded, the, capture, of, wild, shrimp, although, there, are, thousands, of, species, of, shrimp, worldwide, only, about, 20, of, these, species, are, commercially, significant, the, following, table, contains, the, principal, commercial, shrimp, the, seven, most, harvested, species, all, of, them, are, decapods, most, of, them, belong, to, the, dendrobranchiata, and, four, of, them, are, penaeid, shrimp, commercial, techniques, for, catching, wild, shrimp, include, otter, trawls, seines, and, shrimp, baiting, a, system, of, nets, is, used, when, trawling, baited, traps, are, common, in, parts, of, the, pacific, northwest, shrimp, trawling, can, result, in, very, high, incidental, catch, rates, of, non, target, species, in, 1997, the, fao, found, discard, rates, up, to, 20, pounds, for, every, pound, of, shrimp, the, world, average, was, 5, 7, pounds, for, every, pound, of, shrimp, trawl, nets, in, general, and, shrimp, trawls, in, particular, have, been, identified, as, sources, of, mortality, for, species, of, finfish, and, cetaceans, bycatch, is, often, discarded, dead, or, dying, by, the, time, it, is, returned, to, the, sea, and, may, alter, the, ecological, balance, in, discarded, regions, worldwide, shrimp, trawl, fisheries, generate, about, 2, of, the, world, s, catch, of, fish, in, weight, but, result, in, more, than, one, third, of, the, global, bycatch, total, the, most, extensively, fished, species, are, the, akiami, paste, shrimp, the, northern, prawn, the, southern, rough, shrimp, and, the, giant, tiger, prawn, together, these, four, species, account, for, nearly, half, of, the, total, wild, capture, in, recent, years, the, global, capture, of, wild, shrimp, has, been, overtaken, by, the, harvest, from, farmed, shrimp, a, shrimp, farm, is, an, aquaculture, business, for, the, cultivation, of, marine, shrimp, or, prawns, for, human, consumption, commercial, shrimp, farming, began, in, the, 1970s, and, production, grew, steeply, particularly, to, match, the, market, demands, of, the, united, states, japan, and, western, europe, the, total, global, production, of, farmed, shrimp, reached, more, than, 1, 6, million, tonnes, in, 2003, representing, a, value, of, nearly, 9, billion, u, s, dollars, about, 75, of, farmed, shrimp, are, produced, in, asia, in, particular, in, china, thailand, indonesia, india, and, vietnam, the, other, 25, are, produced, mainly, in, latin, america, where, brazil, is, the, largest, producer, by, 2016, the, largest, exporting, nation, is, india, followed, by, ecuador, thailand, indonesia, and, china, as, can, be, seen, from, the, global, production, chart, on, the, left, significant, aquaculture, production, started, slowly, in, the, 1970s, and, then, rapidly, expanded, during, the, 1980s, after, a, lull, in, growth, during, the, 1990s, due, to, pathogens, production, took, off, again, and, by, 2007, exceeded, the, capture, from, wild, fisheries, by, 2010, the, aquaculture, harvest, was, 3, 9, million, tonnes, compared, to, 3, 1, million, tonnes, for, the, capture, of, wild, shrimp, in, the, earlier, years, of, marine, shrimp, farming, the, preferred, species, was, the, large, giant, tiger, prawn, this, species, is, reared, in, circular, holding, tanks, where, they, think, they, are, in, the, open, ocean, and, swim, in, never, ending, migration, around, the, circumference, of, the, tank, in, 2000, global, production, was, 630, 984, tonnes, compared, to, only, 146, 362, tonnes, for, whiteleg, shrimp, subsequently, these, positions, reversed, and, by, 2010, the, production, of, giant, tiger, prawn, increased, modestly, to, 781, 581, tonnes, while, whiteleg, shrimp, rocketed, nearly, twenty, fold, to, 2, 720, 929, tonnes, the, whiteleg, shrimp, is, currently, the, dominant, species, in, shrimp, farming, it, is, a, moderately, large, shrimp, reaching, a, total, length, of, 230, mm, 9, and, is, particularly, suited, to, farming, because, it, breeds, well, in, captivity, can, be, stocked, at, small, sizes, grows, fast, and, at, uniform, rates, has, comparatively, low, protein, requirements, and, adapts, well, to, variable, environmental, conditions, in, china, prawns, are, cultured, along, with, sea, cucumbers, and, some, fish, species, in, integrated, multi, trophic, systems, the, major, producer, of, farmed, shrimp, is, china, other, significant, producers, are, thailand, indonesia, india, vietnam, brazil, ecuador, and, bangladesh, most, farmed, shrimp, is, exported, to, the, united, states, the, european, union, and, japan, also, other, asian, markets, including, south, korea, hong, kong, taiwan, and, singapore, investigations, by, the, guardian, in, 2014, and, the, associated, press, in, 2015, found, human, rights, abuses, on, fishing, boats, operated, by, thailand, the, boats, are, manned, with, slaves, and, catch, shrimp, and, fish, including, fish, for, the, production, of, fishmeal, which, is, fed, to, farmed, prawns, greenpeace, has, challenged, the, sustainability, of, tropical, shrimp, farming, practices, on, the, grounds, that, farming, these, species, has, led, to, the, destruction, of, vast, areas, of, mangroves, in, several, countries, over, fishing, of, juvenile, shrimp, from, the, wild, to, supply, farms, greenpeace, has, placed, a, number, of, the, prominent, tropical, shrimp, species, that, are, farmed, commercially, on, its, seafood, red, list, including, the, whiteleg, shrimp, indian, prawn, and, giant, tiger, shrimp, there, is, also, evidence, that, shrimps, like, other, crustaceans, can, feel, pain, common, welfare, concerns, include, water, pollution, high, population, densities, and, the, spread, of, diseases, additionally, many, female, shrimps, have, their, eyes, cut, without, anesthetic, in, order, to, induce, maturation, of, the, ovaries, shrimp, are, marketed, and, commercialized, with, several, issues, in, mind, most, shrimp, are, sold, frozen, and, marketed, based, on, their, categorization, of, presentation, grading, colour, and, uniformity, shrimp, have, high, levels, of, omega, 3, fatty, acids, and, low, levels, of, mercury, usually, shrimp, is, sold, whole, though, sometimes, only, the, meat, of, shrimp, is, marketed, as, with, other, seafood, shrimp, is, high, in, calcium, iodine, and, protein, but, low, in, food, energy, a, shrimp, based, meal, is, also, a, significant, source, of, cholesterol, from, 122, mg, to, 251, mg, per, 100, g, of, shrimp, depending, on, the, method, of, preparation, shrimp, consumption, however, is, considered, healthy, for, the, circulatory, system, because, the, lack, of, significant, levels, of, saturated, fat, in, shrimp, means, that, the, high, cholesterol, content, in, shrimp, improves, the, ratio, of, ldl, to, hdl, cholesterol, and, lowers, triglycerides, ebiko, shrimp, roe, sometimes, translated, as, shrimp, flakes, is, used, as, one, of, the, ingredients, in, the, preparation, of, sushi, shrimp, and, other, shellfish, are, among, the, most, common, food, allergens, they, are, not, kosher, and, thus, are, forbidden, in, jewish, cuisine, since, the, early, 2020s, plant, based, and, cultured, alternatives, to, shrimps, have, emerged, and, have, been, rapidly, improving, several, types, of, shrimp, are, kept, in, home, aquaria, some, are, purely, ornamental, while, others, are, useful, in, controlling, algae, and, removing, debris, freshwater, shrimp, commonly, available, for, aquaria, include, the, bamboo, shrimp, japanese, marsh, shrimp, caridina, multidentata, also, called, amano, shrimp, as, their, use, in, aquaria, was, pioneered, by, takashi, amano, cherry, shrimp, neocaridina, heteropoda, and, ghost, or, glass, shrimp, palaemonetes, spp, popular, saltwater, shrimp, include, the, cleaner, shrimp, lysmata, amboinensis, the, fire, shrimp, lysmata, debelius, and, the, harlequin, shrimp, hymenocera, picta, the, terms, shrimp, and, prawn, are, common, names, not, scientific, names, they, are, vernacular, or, colloquial, terms, which, lack, the, formal, definition, of, scientific, terms, they, are, not, taxa, but, are, terms, of, convenience, with, little, circumscriptional, significance, there, is, no, reason, to, avoid, using, the, terms, shrimp, or, prawn, when, convenient, but, it, is, important, not, to, confuse, them, with, the, names, or, relationships, of, actual, taxa, according, to, the, crustacean, taxonomist, tin, yam, chan, the, terms, shrimp, and, prawn, have, no, definite, reference, to, any, known, taxonomic, groups, although, the, term, shrimp, is, sometimes, applied, to, smaller, species, while, prawn, is, more, often, used, for, larger, forms, there, is, no, clear, distinction, between, both, terms, and, their, usage, is, often, confused, or, even, reverse, in, different, countries, or, regions, writing, in, 1980, l, b, holthuis, noted, that, the, terms, prawn, and, shrimp, were, used, inconsistently, even, within, a, single, region, generalising, that, larger, species, fished, commercially, were, generally, called, shrimp, in, the, united, states, and, prawns, in, other, english, speaking, countries, although, not, without, exceptions, a, lot, of, confusion, surrounds, the, scope, of, the, term, shrimp, part, of, the, confusion, originates, with, the, association, of, smallness, that, creates, problems, with, shrimp, like, species, that, are, not, small, the, expression, jumbo, shrimp, can, be, viewed, as, an, oxymoron, a, problem, that, does, not, exist, with, the, commercial, designation, jumbo, prawns, the, term, shrimp, originated, around, the, 14th, century, with, the, middle, english, shrimpe, akin, to, the, middle, low, german, schrempen, and, meaning, to, contract, or, wrinkle, and, the, old, norse, skorpna, meaning, to, shrivel, up, or, skreppa, meaning, a, thin, person, it, is, not, clear, where, the, term, prawn, originated, but, early, forms, of, the, word, surfaced, in, england, in, the, early, 15th, century, as, prayne, praine, and, prane, according, to, the, linguist, anatoly, liberman, it, is, unclear, how, shrimp, in, english, came, to, be, associated, with, small, no, germanic, language, associates, the, shrimp, with, its, size, the, same, holds, for, romance, it, remains, unclear, in, what, circumstances, the, name, was, applied, to, the, crustacean, taxonomic, studies, in, europe, on, shrimp, and, prawns, were, shaped, by, the, common, shrimp, and, the, common, prawn, both, found, in, huge, numbers, along, the, european, coastlines, the, common, shrimp, crangon, crangon, was, categorised, in, 1758, by, carl, linnaeus, and, the, common, prawn, palaemon, serratus, was, categorised, in, 1777, by, thomas, pennant, the, common, shrimp, is, a, small, burrowing, species, aligned, with, the, notion, of, a, shrimp, as, being, something, small, whereas, the, common, prawn, is, much, larger, the, terms, true, shrimp, or, true, prawn, are, sometimes, used, to, mean, what, a, particular, person, thinks, is, a, shrimp, or, prawn, this, varies, with, the, person, using, the, terms, but, such, terms, are, not, normally, used, in, the, scientific, literature, because, the, terms, shrimp, and, prawn, themselves, lack, scientific, standing, over, the, years, the, way, shrimp, and, prawn, are, used, has, changed, and, nowadays, the, terms, are, almost, interchangeable, although, from, time, to, time, some, biologists, declare, that, certain, common, names, should, be, confined, to, specific, taxa, the, popular, use, of, these, names, seems, to, continue, unchanged, only, 57, exclusively, fossil, species, are, known, in, the, shrimp, fossil, record, the, earliest, dates, from, the, lower, jurassic, followed, by, specimens, from, the, cretaceous
