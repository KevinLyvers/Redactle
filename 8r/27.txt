homo, habilis, lit, handy, man, is, an, extinct, species, of, archaic, human, from, the, early, pleistocene, of, east, and, south, africa, about, 2, 3, million, years, ago, to, 1, 65, million, years, ago, mya, upon, species, description, in, 1964, h, habilis, was, highly, contested, with, many, researchers, recommending, it, be, synonymised, with, australopithecus, africanus, the, only, other, early, hominin, known, at, the, time, but, h, habilis, received, more, recognition, as, time, went, on, and, more, relevant, discoveries, were, made, by, the, 1980s, h, habilis, was, proposed, to, have, been, a, human, ancestor, directly, evolving, into, homo, erectus, which, directly, led, to, modern, humans, this, viewpoint, is, now, debated, several, specimens, with, insecure, species, identification, were, assigned, to, h, habilis, leading, to, arguments, for, splitting, namely, into, h, rudolfensis, and, h, gautengensis, of, which, only, the, former, has, received, wide, support, like, contemporary, homo, h, habilis, brain, size, generally, varied, from, 500, 900, cm, 3, 31, 55, cu, in, the, body, proportions, of, h, habilis, are, only, known, from, two, highly, fragmentary, skeletons, and, is, based, largely, on, assuming, a, similar, anatomy, to, the, earlier, australopithecines, because, of, this, it, has, also, been, proposed, h, habilis, be, moved, to, the, genus, australopithecus, as, australopithecus, habilis, however, the, interpretation, of, h, habilis, as, a, small, statured, human, with, inefficient, long, distance, travel, capabilities, has, been, challenged, the, presumed, female, specimen, oh, 62, is, traditionally, interpreted, as, having, been, 100, 120, cm, 3, ft, 3, in, 3, ft, 11, in, in, height, and, 20, 37, kg, 44, 82, lb, in, weight, assuming, australopithecine, like, proportions, but, assuming, humanlike, proportions, she, would, have, been, about, 148, cm, 4, ft, 10, in, and, 35, kg, 77, lb, nonetheless, h, habilis, may, have, been, at, least, partially, arboreal, like, what, is, postulated, for, australopithecines, early, hominins, are, typically, reconstructed, as, having, thick, hair, and, marked, sexual, dimorphism, with, males, much, larger, than, females, though, relative, male, and, female, size, is, not, definitively, known, h, habilis, manufactured, the, oldowan, stone, tool, industry, and, mainly, used, tools, in, butchering, early, homo, compared, to, australopithecines, are, generally, thought, to, have, consumed, high, quantities, of, meat, and, in, the, case, of, h, habilis, scavenged, meat, typically, early, hominins, are, interpreted, as, having, lived, in, polygynous, societies, though, this, is, highly, speculative, assuming, h, habilis, society, was, similar, to, that, of, modern, savanna, chimpanzees, and, baboons, groups, may, have, numbered, 70, 85, members, this, configuration, would, be, advantageous, with, multiple, males, to, defend, against, open, savanna, predators, such, as, big, cats, hyenas, and, crocodiles, h, habilis, coexisted, with, h, rudolfensis, h, ergaster, h, erectus, and, paranthropus, boisei, the, first, recognised, remains, oh, 7, partial, juvenile, skull, hand, and, foot, bones, dating, to, 1, 75, million, years, ago, mya, were, discovered, in, olduvai, gorge, tanzania, in, 1960, by, jonathan, leakey, with, other, native, africans, who, digged, into, olduvai, gorge, and, who, worked, for, jonathan, leakey, however, the, actual, first, remains, oh, 4, a, molar, were, discovered, by, the, senior, assistant, of, louis, and, mary, leakey, jonathan, s, parents, heselon, mukiri, other, native, africans, in, 1959, but, this, was, not, realised, at, the, time, by, this, time, the, leakeys, had, spent, 29, years, excavating, in, olduvai, gorge, for, early, hominin, remains, but, had, instead, recovered, mainly, other, animal, remains, as, well, as, the, oldowan, stone, tool, industry, the, industry, had, been, ascribed, to, paranthropus, boisei, at, the, time, zinjanthropus, in, 1959, as, it, was, the, first, and, only, hominin, recovered, in, the, area, but, this, was, revised, upon, oh, 7, s, discovery, in, 1964, louis, south, african, palaeoanthropologist, phillip, v, tobias, and, british, primatologist, john, r, napier, officially, assigned, the, remains, into, the, genus, homo, and, on, recommendation, by, australian, anthropologist, raymond, dart, the, specific, name, h, habilis, meaning, able, handy, mentally, skillful, vigorous, in, latin, the, specimen, s, association, with, the, oldowan, then, considered, evidence, of, advanced, cognitive, ability, was, also, used, as, justification, for, classifying, it, into, homo, oh, 7, was, designated, the, holotype, specimen, after, description, it, was, hotly, debated, if, h, habilis, should, be, reclassified, into, australopithecus, africanus, the, only, other, early, hominin, known, at, the, time, in, part, because, the, remains, were, so, old, and, at, the, time, homo, was, presumed, to, have, evolved, in, asia, with, the, australopithecines, having, no, living, descendants, also, the, brain, size, was, smaller, than, what, wilfrid, le, gros, clark, proposed, in, 1955, when, considering, homo, the, classification, h, habilis, began, to, receive, wider, acceptance, as, more, fossil, elements, and, species, were, unearthed, in, 1983, tobias, proposed, that, a, africanus, was, a, direct, ancestor, of, paranthropus, and, homo, the, two, were, sister, taxa, and, that, a, africanus, evolved, into, h, habilis, which, evolved, into, h, erectus, which, evolved, into, modern, humans, by, a, process, of, cladogenesis, he, further, said, that, there, was, a, major, evolutionary, leap, between, a, africanus, and, h, habilis, and, thereupon, human, evolution, progressed, gradually, because, h, habilis, brain, size, had, nearly, doubled, compared, to, australopithecine, predecessors, many, had, accepted, tobias, model, and, assigned, late, pliocene, to, early, pleistocene, hominin, remains, outside, the, range, of, paranthropus, and, h, erectus, into, h, habilis, for, non, skull, elements, this, was, done, on, the, basis, of, size, as, there, was, a, lack, of, clear, diagnostic, characteristics, because, of, these, practices, the, range, of, variation, for, the, species, became, quite, wide, and, the, terms, h, habilis, sensu, stricto, i, e, strictly, and, h, habilis, sensu, lato, i, e, broadly, were, in, use, to, include, and, exclude, respectively, more, discrepant, morphs, to, address, this, in, 1985, english, palaeoanthropologist, bernard, wood, proposed, that, the, comparatively, massive, skull, knm, er, 1470, from, lake, turkana, kenya, discovered, in, 1972, and, assigned, to, h, habilis, actually, represented, a, different, species, now, referred, to, as, homo, rudolfensis, it, is, also, argued, that, instead, it, represents, a, male, specimen, whereas, other, h, habilis, specimens, are, female, early, homo, from, south, africa, have, variously, been, assigned, to, h, habilis, or, h, ergaster, h, erectus, but, species, designation, has, largely, been, unclear, in, 2010, australian, archaeologist, darren, curoe, proposed, splitting, off, south, african, early, homo, into, a, new, species, homo, gautengensis, in, 1986, oh, 62, a, fragmentary, skeleton, was, discovered, by, american, anthropologist, tim, d, white, in, association, with, h, habilis, skull, fragments, definitively, establishing, aspects, of, h, habilis, skeletal, anatomy, for, the, first, time, and, revealing, more, australopithecus, like, than, homo, like, features, because, of, this, as, well, as, similarities, in, dental, adaptations, wood, and, biological, anthropologist, mark, collard, suggested, moving, the, species, to, australopithecus, in, 1999, however, reevaluation, of, oh, 62, to, a, more, humanlike, physiology, if, correct, would, cast, doubt, on, this, the, discovery, of, the, 1, 8, ma, georgian, dmanisi, skulls, in, the, early, 2000s, which, exhibit, several, similarities, with, early, homo, has, led, to, suggestions, that, all, contemporary, groups, of, early, homo, in, africa, including, h, habilis, and, h, rudolfensis, are, the, same, species, and, should, be, assigned, to, h, erectus, h, habilis, h, rudolfensis, h, ergaster, h, erectus, h, antecessor, h, heidelbergensis, h, neanderthalensis, h, sapiens, there, is, still, no, wide, consensus, as, to, whether, or, not, h, habilis, is, ancestral, to, h, ergaster, h, erectus, or, is, an, offshoot, of, the, human, line, and, whether, or, not, all, specimens, assigned, to, h, habilis, are, correctly, assigned, or, the, species, is, an, assemblage, of, different, australopithecus, and, homo, species, nonetheless, h, habilis, and, h, rudolfensis, generally, are, recognised, members, of, the, genus, at, the, base, of, the, family, tree, with, arguments, for, synonymisation, or, removal, from, the, genus, not, widely, adopted, though, it, is, now, largely, agreed, upon, that, homo, evolved, from, australopithecus, the, timing, and, placement, of, this, split, has, been, much, debated, with, many, australopithecus, species, having, been, proposed, as, the, ancestor, the, discovery, of, ld, 350, 1, the, oldest, homo, specimen, dating, to, 2, 8, mya, in, the, afar, region, of, ethiopia, may, indicate, that, the, genus, evolved, from, a, afarensis, around, this, time, this, specimen, was, initially, classified, as, homo, sp, though, subsequent, studies, have, suggested, that, it, also, shares, characteristics, with, australopithecus, and, that, it, is, clearly, distinct, from, h, habilis, the, oldest, h, habilis, specimen, a, l, 666, 1, dates, to, 2, 3, mya, but, is, anatomically, more, derived, has, less, ancestral, or, basal, traits, than, the, younger, oh, 7, suggesting, derived, and, basal, morphs, lived, concurrently, and, that, the, h, habilis, lineage, began, before, 2, 3, mya, based, on, 2, 1, million, year, old, stone, tools, from, shangchen, china, h, habilis, or, an, ancestral, species, may, have, dispersed, across, asia, the, youngest, h, habilis, specimen, oh, 13, dates, to, about, 1, 65, mya, it, has, generally, been, thought, that, brain, size, increased, along, the, human, line, especially, rapidly, at, the, transition, between, species, with, h, habilis, brain, size, smaller, than, that, of, h, ergaster, h, erectus, jumping, from, about, 600, 650, cc, 37, 40, cu, in, in, h, habilis, to, about, 900, 1, 000, cc, 55, 61, cu, in, in, h, ergaster, and, h, erectus, however, a, 2015, study, showed, that, the, brain, sizes, of, h, habilis, h, rudolfensis, and, h, ergaster, generally, ranged, between, 500, 900, cc, 31, 55, cu, in, after, reappraising, the, brain, volume, of, oh, 7, from, 647, 687, cc, 39, 5, 41, 9, cu, in, to, 729, 824, cc, 44, 5, 50, 3, cu, in, this, does, nonetheless, indicate, a, jump, from, australopithecine, brain, size, which, generally, ranged, from, 400, 500, cc, 24, 31, cu, in, the, brain, anatomy, of, all, homo, features, an, expanded, cerebrum, in, comparison, to, australopithecines, the, pattern, of, striations, on, the, teeth, of, oh, 65, slant, right, which, may, have, been, accidentally, self, inflicted, when, the, individual, was, pulling, a, piece, of, meat, with, its, teeth, and, the, left, hand, while, trying, to, cut, it, with, a, stone, tool, using, the, right, hand, if, correct, this, could, indicate, right, handedness, and, handedness, is, associated, with, major, reorganisation, of, the, brain, and, the, lateralisation, of, brain, function, between, the, left, and, right, hemispheres, this, scenario, has, also, been, hypothesised, for, some, neanderthal, specimens, lateralisation, could, be, implicated, in, tool, use, in, modern, humans, lateralisation, is, weakly, associated, with, language, the, tooth, rows, of, h, habilis, were, v, shaped, as, opposed, to, u, shaped, in, later, homo, and, the, mouth, jutted, outwards, was, prognathic, though, the, face, was, flat, from, the, nose, up, based, on, the, fragmentary, skeletons, oh, 62, presumed, female, and, knm, er, 3735, presumed, male, h, habilis, body, anatomy, has, generally, been, considered, to, have, been, more, apelike, than, even, that, of, the, earlier, a, afarensis, and, consistent, with, an, at, least, partially, arboreal, lifestyle, in, the, trees, as, is, assumed, in, australopithecines, based, on, oh, 62, and, assuming, comparable, body, dimensions, to, australopithecines, h, habilis, has, generally, been, interpreted, as, having, been, small, bodied, like, australopithecines, with, oh, 62, generally, estimated, at, 100, 120, cm, 3, ft, 3, in, 3, ft, 11, in, in, height, and, 20, 37, kg, 44, 82, lb, in, weight, however, assuming, longer, modern, humanlike, legs, oh, 62, would, have, been, about, 148, cm, 4, ft, 10, in, and, 35, kg, 77, lb, and, knm, er, 3735, about, the, same, size, for, comparison, modern, human, men, and, women, in, the, year, 1900, averaged, 163, cm, 5, ft, 4, in, and, 152, 7, cm, 5, 01, ft, respectively, it, is, generally, assumed, that, pre, h, ergaster, hominins, including, h, habilis, exhibited, notable, sexual, dimorphism, with, males, markedly, bigger, than, females, however, relative, female, body, mass, is, unknown, in, this, species, early, hominins, including, h, habilis, are, thought, to, have, had, thick, body, hair, coverage, like, modern, non, human, apes, because, they, appear, to, have, inhabited, colder, regions, and, are, thought, to, have, had, a, less, active, lifestyle, than, presumed, hairless, post, ergaster, species, consequently, they, probably, required, thick, body, hair, to, stay, warm, based, on, dental, development, rates, h, habilis, is, assumed, to, have, had, an, accelerated, growth, rate, compared, to, modern, humans, more, like, that, of, modern, non, human, apes, the, arms, of, h, habilis, and, australopithecines, have, generally, been, considered, to, have, been, proportionally, long, and, so, adapted, for, climbing, and, swinging, in, 2004, anthropologists, martin, haeusler, and, henry, mchenry, argued, that, because, the, humerus, to, femur, ratio, of, oh, 62, is, within, the, range, of, variation, for, modern, humans, and, knm, er, 3735, is, close, to, the, modern, human, average, it, is, unsafe, to, assume, apelike, proportions, nonetheless, the, humerus, of, oh, 62, measured, 258, 270, mm, 10, 2, 10, 6, in, long, and, the, ulna, forearm, 245, 255, mm, 9, 6, 10, 0, in, which, is, closer, to, the, proportion, seen, in, chimpanzees, the, hand, bones, of, oh, 7, suggest, precision, gripping, important, in, dexterity, as, well, as, adaptations, for, climbing, in, regard, to, the, femur, traditionally, comparisons, with, the, a, afarensis, specimen, al, 288, 1, have, been, used, to, reconstruct, stout, legs, for, h, habilis, but, haeusler, and, mchenry, suggested, the, more, gracile, oh, 24, femur, either, belonging, to, h, ergaster, h, erectus, or, p, boisei, may, be, a, more, apt, comparison, in, this, instance, h, habilis, would, have, had, longer, humanlike, legs, and, have, been, effective, long, distance, travellers, as, is, assumed, to, have, been, the, case, in, h, ergaster, however, estimating, the, unpreserved, length, of, a, fossil, is, highly, problematic, the, thickness, of, the, limb, bones, in, oh, 62, is, more, similar, to, chimpanzees, than, h, ergaster, h, erectus, and, modern, humans, which, may, indicate, different, load, bearing, capabilities, more, suitable, for, arboreality, in, h, habilis, the, strong, fibula, of, oh, 35, though, this, may, belong, to, p, boisei, is, more, like, that, of, non, human, apes, and, consistent, with, arboreality, and, vertical, climbing, oh, 8, a, foot, is, better, suited, for, terrestrial, movement, than, the, foot, of, a, afarensis, though, it, still, retains, many, apelike, features, consistent, with, climbing, however, the, foot, has, projected, toe, bone, and, compacted, mid, foot, joint, structures, which, restrict, rotation, between, the, foot, and, ankle, as, well, as, at, the, front, foot, foot, stability, enhances, the, efficiency, of, force, transfer, between, the, leg, and, the, foot, and, vice, versa, and, is, implicated, in, the, plantar, arch, elastic, spring, mechanism, which, generates, energy, while, running, but, not, walking, this, could, possibly, indicate, h, habilis, was, capable, of, some, degree, of, endurance, running, which, is, typically, thought, to, have, evolved, later, in, h, ergaster, h, erectus, typically, h, ergaster, h, erectus, is, considered, to, have, been, the, first, human, to, have, lived, in, a, monogamous, society, and, all, preceding, hominins, were, polygynous, however, it, is, highly, difficult, to, speculate, with, any, confidence, the, group, dynamics, of, early, hominins, the, degree, of, sexual, dimorphism, and, the, size, disparity, between, males, and, females, is, often, used, to, correlate, between, polygyny, with, high, disparity, and, monogamy, with, low, disparity, based, on, general, trends, though, not, without, exceptions, seen, in, modern, primates, rates, of, sexual, dimorphism, are, difficult, to, determine, as, early, hominin, anatomy, is, poorly, represented, in, the, fossil, record, in, some, cases, sex, is, arbitrarily, determined, in, large, part, based, on, perceived, size, and, apparent, robustness, in, the, absence, of, more, reliable, elements, in, sex, identification, namely, the, pelvis, mating, systems, are, also, based, on, dental, anatomy, but, early, hominins, possess, a, mosaic, anatomy, of, different, traits, not, seen, together, in, modern, primates, the, enlarged, cheek, teeth, would, suggest, marked, size, related, dimorphism, and, thus, intense, male, male, conflict, over, mates, and, a, polygynous, society, but, the, small, canines, should, indicate, the, opposite, other, selective, pressures, including, diet, can, also, dramatically, impact, dental, anatomy, the, spatial, distribution, of, tools, and, processed, animal, bones, at, the, flk, zinj, and, ptk, sites, in, olduvai, gorge, indicate, the, inhabitants, used, this, area, as, a, communal, butchering, and, eating, grounds, as, opposed, to, the, nuclear, family, system, of, modern, hunter, gatherers, where, the, group, is, subdivided, into, smaller, units, each, with, their, own, butchering, and, eating, grounds, the, behaviour, of, early, homo, including, h, habilis, is, sometimes, modelled, on, that, of, savanna, chimps, and, baboons, these, communities, consist, of, several, males, as, opposed, to, a, harem, society, in, order, to, defend, the, group, on, the, dangerous, and, exposed, habitat, sometimes, engaging, in, a, group, display, of, throwing, sticks, and, stones, against, enemies, and, predators, the, left, foot, oh, 8, seems, to, have, been, bitten, off, by, a, crocodile, possibly, crocodylus, anthropophagus, and, the, leg, oh, 35, which, either, belongs, to, p, boisei, or, h, habilis, shows, evidence, of, leopard, predation, h, habilis, and, contemporary, hominins, were, likely, predated, upon, by, other, large, carnivores, of, the, time, such, as, in, olduvai, gorge, the, hunting, hyena, chasmaporthetes, nitidula, and, the, saber, toothed, cats, dinofelis, and, megantereon, in, 1993, american, palaeoanthropologist, leslie, c, aiello, and, british, evolutionary, psychologist, robin, dunbar, estimated, that, h, habilis, group, size, ranged, from, 70, 85, members, on, the, upper, end, of, chimp, and, baboon, group, size, based, on, trends, seen, in, neocortex, size, and, group, size, in, modern, non, human, primates, h, habilis, coexisted, with, h, rudolfensis, h, ergaster, h, erectus, and, p, boisei, it, is, unclear, how, all, of, these, species, interacted, to, explain, why, p, boisei, was, associated, with, olduwan, tools, despite, not, being, the, knapper, the, one, who, made, the, tools, leakey, and, colleagues, when, describing, h, habilis, suggested, that, one, possibility, was, p, boisei, was, killed, by, h, habilis, perhaps, as, food, however, when, describing, p, boisei, five, years, earlier, louis, leakey, said, there, is, no, reason, whatever, in, this, case, to, believe, that, the, skull, represents, the, victim, of, a, cannibalistic, feast, by, some, hypothetical, more, advanced, type, of, man, it, is, thought, h, habilis, derived, meat, from, scavenging, rather, than, hunting, scavenger, hypothesis, acting, as, a, confrontational, scavenger, and, stealing, kills, from, smaller, predators, such, as, jackals, or, cheetahs, fruit, was, likely, also, an, important, dietary, component, indicated, by, dental, erosion, consistent, with, repetitive, exposure, to, acidity, based, on, dental, microwear, texture, analysis, h, habilis, like, other, early, homo, likely, did, not, regularly, consume, tough, foods, microwear, texture, complexity, is, on, average, somewhere, between, that, of, tough, food, eaters, and, leaf, eaters, folivores, and, points, to, an, increasingly, generalised, and, omnivorous, diet, freshwater, fish, likely, were, also, consumed, evidenced, by, the, findings, of, fish, remains, at, archaeological, sites, most, likely, associated, with, h, habilis, it, is, typically, thought, that, the, diets, of, h, habilis, and, other, early, homo, had, a, greater, proportion, of, meat, than, australopithecus, and, that, this, led, to, brain, growth, the, main, hypotheses, regarding, this, are, meat, is, energy, and, nutrient, rich, and, put, evolutionary, pressure, on, developing, enhanced, cognitive, skills, to, facilitate, strategic, scavenging, and, monopolise, fresh, carcasses, or, meat, allowed, the, large, and, calorie, expensive, ape, gut, to, decrease, in, size, allowing, this, energy, to, be, diverted, to, brain, growth, alternatively, it, is, also, suggested, that, early, homo, in, a, drying, climate, with, scarcer, food, options, relied, primarily, on, underground, storage, organs, such, as, tubers, and, food, sharing, which, facilitated, social, bonding, among, both, male, and, female, group, members, however, unlike, what, is, presumed, for, h, ergaster, and, later, homo, short, statured, early, homo, are, generally, considered, to, have, been, incapable, of, endurance, running, and, hunting, and, the, long, and, australopithecus, like, forearm, of, h, habilis, could, indicate, early, homo, were, still, arboreal, to, a, degree, also, organised, hunting, and, gathering, is, thought, to, have, emerged, in, h, ergaster, nonetheless, the, proposed, food, gathering, models, to, explain, large, brain, growth, necessitate, increased, daily, travel, distance, it, has, also, been, argued, that, h, habilis, instead, had, long, modern, humanlike, legs, and, was, fully, capable, of, effective, long, distance, travel, while, still, remaining, at, least, partially, arboreal, large, incisor, size, in, h, habilis, compared, to, australopithecus, predecessors, implies, this, species, relied, on, incisors, more, the, bodies, of, the, mandibles, of, h, habilis, and, other, early, homo, are, thicker, than, those, of, modern, humans, and, all, living, apes, more, comparable, to, australopithecus, the, mandibular, body, resists, torsion, from, the, bite, force, or, chewing, meaning, their, jaws, could, produce, unusually, powerful, stresses, while, eating, the, greater, molar, cusp, relief, in, h, habilis, compared, to, australopithecus, suggests, the, former, used, tools, to, fracture, tough, foods, such, as, pliable, plant, parts, or, meat, otherwise, the, cusps, would, have, been, more, worn, down, nonetheless, the, jaw, adaptations, for, processing, mechanically, challenging, food, indicates, technological, advancement, did, not, greatly, affect, diet, h, habilis, is, associated, with, the, early, stone, age, oldowan, stone, tool, industry, individuals, likely, used, these, tools, primarily, to, butcher, and, skin, animals, and, crush, bones, but, also, sometimes, to, saw, and, scrape, wood, and, cut, soft, plants, knappers, individuals, shaping, stones, appear, to, have, carefully, selected, lithic, cores, and, knew, that, certain, rocks, would, break, in, a, specific, way, when, struck, hard, enough, and, on, the, right, spot, and, they, produced, several, different, types, including, choppers, polyhedrons, and, discoids, nonetheless, specific, shapes, were, likely, not, thought, of, in, advance, and, probably, stem, from, a, lack, of, standardisation, in, producing, such, tools, as, well, as, the, types, of, raw, materials, at, the, knappers, disposal, for, example, spheroids, are, common, at, olduvai, which, features, an, abundance, of, large, and, soft, quartz, and, quartzite, pieces, whereas, koobi, fora, lacks, spheroids, and, provides, predominantly, hard, basalt, lava, rocks, unlike, the, later, acheulean, culture, invented, by, h, ergaster, h, erectus, oldowan, technology, does, not, require, planning, and, foresight, to, manufacture, and, thus, does, not, indicate, high, cognition, in, oldowan, knappers, though, it, does, require, a, degree, of, coordination, and, some, knowledge, of, mechanics, oldowan, tools, infrequently, exhibit, retouching, and, were, probably, discarded, immediately, after, use, most, of, the, time, the, oldowan, was, first, reported, in, 1934, but, it, was, not, until, the, 1960s, that, it, become, widely, accepted, as, the, earliest, culture, dating, to, 1, 8, mya, and, as, having, been, manufactured, by, h, habilis, since, then, more, discoveries, have, placed, the, origins, of, material, culture, substantially, backwards, in, time, with, the, oldowan, being, discovered, in, ledi, geraru, and, gona, in, ethiopia, dating, to, 2, 6, mya, perhaps, associated, with, the, evolution, of, the, genus, australopithecines, are, also, known, to, have, manufactured, tools, such, as, the, 3, 3, ma, lomekwi, stone, tool, industry, and, some, evidence, of, butchering, from, about, 3, 4, mya, nonetheless, the, comparatively, sharp, edged, oldowan, culture, was, a, major, innovation, from, australopithecine, technology, and, it, would, have, allowed, different, feeding, strategies, and, the, ability, to, process, a, wider, range, of, foods, which, would, have, been, advantageous, in, the, changing, climate, of, the, time, it, is, unclear, if, the, oldowan, was, independently, invented, or, if, it, was, the, result, of, hominin, experimentation, with, rocks, over, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, across, multiple, species, in, 1962, a, 366, cm, 427, cm, 30, cm, 12, ft, 14, ft, 1, ft, circle, made, with, volcanic, rocks, was, discovered, in, olduvai, gorge, at, 61, 76, cm, 2, 2, 5, ft,
