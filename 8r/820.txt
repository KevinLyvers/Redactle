the, order, peramelemorphia, p, r, m, l, m, r, f, i, includes, the, bandicoots, and, bilbies, all, members, of, the, order, are, endemic, to, australia, new, guinea, and, most, have, the, characteristic, bandicoot, shape, a, plump, arch, backed, body, with, a, long, delicately, tapering, snout, very, large, upright, ears, relatively, long, thin, legs, and, a, thin, tail, their, size, varies, from, about, 140, grams, up, to, 4, kilograms, but, most, species, are, about, one, kilogram, the, position, of, the, peramelemorphia, within, the, marsupial, family, tree, has, long, been, puzzling, and, controversial, there, are, two, morphological, features, in, the, order, that, appear, to, show, a, clear, evolutionary, link, with, another, marsupial, group, the, type, of, foot, and, the, teeth, unfortunately, these, clear, signposts, point, in, opposite, directions, all, members, of, the, order, are, polyprotodont, have, several, pairs, of, lower, front, teeth, in, the, case, of, the, peramelemorphia, three, pairs, this, suggests, that, they, have, evolved, within, dasyuromorphia, marsupial, carnivores, on, the, other, hand, they, also, have, an, unusual, feature, in, their, feet, the, second, and, third, toes, are, fused, together, this, condition, is, called, syndactyly, and, is, characteristic, of, the, diprotodontia, the, order, of, marsupial, herbivores, that, includes, kangaroos, wombats, possums, and, many, others, attempts, to, resolve, this, puzzle, include, the, view, that, the, bandicoot, group, evolved, from, the, carnivores, retaining, the, polyprotodont, dentition, and, independently, evolving, a, syndactyl, hind, foot, the, contrary, view, that, syndactyly, is, so, unusual, that, it, is, unlikely, to, have, evolved, twice, and, therefore, the, bandicoot, group, must, have, evolved, from, a, possum, like, diprotodont, creature, and, re, evolved, its, extra, teeth, a, third, view, suggests, that, the, bandicoot, group, evolved, from, a, primitive, carnivore, developed, the, syndactylous, hind, foot, as, a, specialisation, for, climbing, and, the, diprotodonts, then, split, off, and, evolved, the, two, tooth, jaw, that, gives, them, their, name, recent, molecular, level, investigations, do, not, so, far, appear, to, have, resolved, the, puzzle, but, do, strongly, suggest, that, whatever, the, relationship, of, the, bandicoot, group, to, the, other, marsupial, orders, may, be, it, is, a, distant, one, recent, molecular, analyses, have, resulted, in, a, phylogenetic, reconstruction, of, the, members, of, peramelemorphia, with, quite, strong, support, the, most, basal, split, separates, thylacomyidae, macrotis, from, all, other, bandicoots, probably, the, next, to, diverge, was, the, recently, extinct, chaeropodidae, chaeropus, the, remaining, taxa, comprise, the, peramelidae, which, divides, into, subfamilies, peramelinae, isoodon, and, perameles, and, a, clade, in, which, the, echymiperinae, echymipera, and, microperoryctes, form, a, sister, group, to, peroryctinae, peroryctes, macrotis, chaeropus, isoodon, perameles, echymipera, microperoryctes, peroryctes, macrotis, rhynchomeles, isoodon, perameles, peroryctes, echymipera, microperoryctes, macrotis, isoodon, perameles, peroryctes, echymipera, microperoryctes, many, specimens, of, modern, peramelemorphian, e, g, perameles, spp, and, isoodon, spp, have, been, recovered, in, the, fossil, record, from, pleistocene, and, holocene, fossil, localities, however, very, few, fossil, species, have, been, recovered, to, date, the, first, species, of, fossil, peramelemorphian, was, described, by, r, a, stirton, in, 1955, the, specimen, stirton, described, was, a, partial, lower, jaw, from, the, tirari, desert, in, central, australia, pliocene, in, age, the, lower, jaw, morphology, suggested, a, relationship, with, bilbies, family, thylacomyidae, and, was, named, ischnodon, australis, it, was, not, until, 1976, that, archer, and, wade, described, the, next, fossil, bandicoot, a, single, upper, molar, was, recovered, from, the, bluff, downs, fossil, site, allingham, formation, in, northern, queensland, also, pliocene, in, age, the, tooth, was, similar, to, that, of, species, of, perameles, and, was, therefore, named, perameles, allinghamensis, in, 1995, the, first, miocene, species, was, described, from, riversleigh, and, was, named, yarala, burchfieldi, by, dr, jeannette, muirhead, the, species, was, represented, by, several, upper, and, lower, jaws, which, were, smaller, than, any, living, bandicoots, and, had, a, very, primitive, dentition, a, skull, was, later, recovered, in, 2000, the, first, for, any, fossil, peramelemorphian, to, date, features, of, the, skull, and, dentition, suggested, that, yarala, burchfieldi, was, distinct, from, other, peramelemorphians, and, for, this, reason, a, new, superfamily, yaraloidea, and, family, yaralidae, were, erected, to, classify, this, species, in, 1997, muirhead, dawson, and, archer, described, a, new, species, of, perameles, perameles, bowensis, from, teeth, recovered, from, two, pliocene, fossil, localities, bow, and, wellington, caves, the, same, species, was, later, reported, in, 2000, from, chinchilla, queensland, by, mackness, and, colleagues, in, 2002, price, described, a, new, species, perameles, perameles, sobbei, from, the, darling, downs, pleistocene, in, age, south, eastern, queensland, this, species, was, represented, by, a, lower, jaw, and, a, few, isolated, lower, molars, additional, material, were, later, described, in, 2005, from, the, same, site, including, upper, molars, a, second, species, of, yarala, yarala, kida, was, described, in, 2006, by, schwartz, this, species, was, recovered, from, kangaroo, well, a, late, oligocene, site, from, the, northern, territory, in, australia, this, species, is, thought, to, be, even, more, primitive, than, yarala, burchfieldi, the, second, fossil, skull, of, any, fossil, peramelemorphian, was, also, recovered, from, miocene, sites, of, riversleigh, in, fact, more, than, one, skull, of, this, new, species, was, found, and, several, lower, and, upper, jaws, and, was, significantly, different, from, any, other, bandicoot, to, erect, a, new, genus, galadi, the, species, was, named, galadi, speciosus, by, travouillon, and, colleagues, it, was, short, snouted, unlike, modern, bandicoots, suggesting, that, it, was, more, carnivorous, than, its, omnivorous, modern, relatives, its, relationship, to, other, bandicoots, is, unclear, but, it, was, likely, to, be, less, primitive, than, yarala, but, more, primitive, than, living, bandicoots, an, additional, three, species, of, galadi, were, later, described, in, 2013, and, named, galadi, grandis, galadi, amplus, and, galadi, adversus, gurovich, et, al, 2013, described, a, new, species, of, mouse, sized, bandicoot, from, riversleigh, and, from, kutjamarpu, southern, australia, the, species, named, bulungu, palara, is, represented, by, a, skull, and, several, lower, and, upper, jaws, two, other, species, in, this, genus, were, also, described, from, the, etadunna, formation, in, south, australia, bulungu, muirheadae, which, was, the, oldest, fossil, bandicoot, recovered, as, of, 2013, about, 24, million, years, old, and, bulungu, campbelli, the, oldest, modern, bandicoot, peramelid, and, the, oldest, bilby, thylacomyid, were, later, discovered, by, travouillon, et, al, 2014, from, riversleigh, world, heritage, area, from, middle, miocene, fossil, deposits, around, 15, million, years, old, the, peramelid, crash, bandicoot, was, named, after, the, famous, video, game, character, and, is, only, represented, by, a, single, upper, jaw, the, bilby, liyamayi, dayi, named, after, geologist, and, philanthropist, robert, day, is, only, known, from, 3, teeth, 2, upper, molar, 1, lower, molar, the, first, record, of, sexual, dimorphism, difference, in, size, between, males, and, females, in, a, fossil, bandicoot, was, reported, from, two, new, species, from, riversleigh, travouillon, et, al, 2014, named, madju, variae, and, madju, encorensis, they, are, closely, related, to, modern, bandicoots, but, do, not, fall, in, any, modern, family, as, did, galadi, and, bulungu, instead, they, are, classified, as, perameloid, with, all, known, peremelemorphian, to, the, exclusion, of, yaralids, madju, variae, is, also, unusual, in, preserving, an, ontogenetic, series, age, series, from, pouch, young, to, adult, the, second, of, any, fossil, marsupial, mammal, in, australia, the, study, of, this, ontogenetic, series, lead, researchers, to, think, that, madju, variae, developed, slow, than, modern, bandicoots, much, more, like, a, bilby, and, therefore, the, rapid, development, of, modern, bandicoots, must, have, evolved, after, the, middle, miocene, when, australia, started, to, become, more, arid
