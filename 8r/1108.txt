collard, is, a, group, of, loose, leafed, cultivars, of, brassica, oleracea, the, same, species, as, many, common, vegetables, including, cabbage, and, broccoli, part, of, the, acephala, kale, cultivar, group, it, is, also, classified, as, the, variety, b, oleracea, var, viridis, the, plants, are, grown, as, a, food, crop, for, their, large, dark, green, edible, leaves, which, are, cooked, and, eaten, as, vegetables, collard, greens, have, been, cultivated, as, food, since, classical, antiquity, the, term, colewort, is, a, medieval, term, for, non, heading, brassica, crops, the, term, collard, has, been, used, to, include, many, non, heading, brassica, oleracea, crops, while, american, collards, are, best, placed, in, the, viridis, crop, group, the, acephala, greek, for, without, a, head, cultivar, group, is, also, used, referring, to, a, lack, of, close, knit, core, of, leaves, a, head, like, cabbage, does, making, collards, more, tolerant, of, high, humidity, levels, and, less, susceptible, to, fungal, diseases, in, africa, it, is, known, as, sukuma, east, africa, muriwo, or, umbhida, southern, africa, in, india, it, is, known, as, haakh, kashmir, the, plant, is, a, biennial, where, winter, frost, occurs, some, varieties, may, be, perennial, in, warmer, regions, it, has, an, upright, stalk, often, growing, over, two, feet, tall, and, up, to, six, feet, for, the, portuguese, cultivars, popular, cultivars, of, collard, greens, include, georgia, southern, vates, morris, heading, blue, max, top, bunch, butter, collard, couve, manteiga, couve, tronchuda, and, groninger, blauw, collard, is, generally, described, as, part, of, the, acephala, kale, cultivar, group, but, is, also, classified, as, the, variety, b, oleracea, var, viridis, the, plant, is, commercially, cultivated, for, its, thick, slightly, bitter, edible, leaves, they, are, available, year, round, but, are, tastier, and, more, nutritious, in, the, cold, months, after, the, first, frost, for, best, texture, the, leaves, are, picked, before, they, reach, their, maximum, size, at, which, stage, they, are, thicker, and, are, cooked, differently, from, the, new, leaves, age, does, not, affect, flavor, flavor, and, texture, also, depend, on, the, cultivar, the, couve, manteiga, and, couve, tronchuda, are, especially, appreciated, in, brazil, and, portugal, the, large, number, of, varieties, grown, in, the, united, states, decreased, as, people, moved, to, towns, after, world, war, ii, leaving, only, five, varieties, commonly, in, cultivation, however, seeds, of, many, varieties, remained, in, use, by, individual, farmers, growers, and, seed, savers, as, well, as, within, u, s, government, seed, collections, in, the, appalachian, region, cabbage, collards, characterized, by, yellow, green, leaves, and, a, partially, heading, structure, are, more, popular, than, the, dark, green, non, heading, types, in, the, coastal, south, there, have, been, projects, from, the, early, 2000s, to, both, preserve, seeds, of, uncommon, varieties, and, also, enable, more, varieties, to, return, to, cultivation, the, sting, nematode, belonolaimus, gracilis, and, the, awl, nematode, dolichodorus, spp, are, both, ectoparasites, that, can, injure, collard, root, symptoms, include, stubby, or, coarse, roots, that, are, dark, at, the, tips, shoot, symptoms, include, stunted, growth, premature, wilting, and, chlorosis, nguyen, and, smart, 1975, another, species, of, the, sting, worm, belonolaimus, longicaudatus, is, a, pest, of, collards, in, georgia, and, north, carolina, robbins, and, barker, 1973, b, longicaudatus, is, devastating, to, seedlings, and, transplants, as, few, as, three, nematodes, per, 100, g, 3, 5, oz, of, soil, when, transplanting, can, cause, significant, yield, losses, on, susceptible, plants, they, are, most, common, in, sandy, soils, noling, 2012, the, stubby, root, nematodes, trichodorus, and, paratrichodorus, attach, and, feed, near, the, tip, of, collard, s, taproots, the, damage, caused, prevents, proper, root, elongation, leading, to, tight, mats, that, could, appear, swollen, therefore, resulting, in, a, stubby, root, noling, 2012, several, species, of, the, root, knot, nematode, meloidogyne, spp, infest, collards, these, include, m, javanica, m, incognita, and, m, arenaria, second, stage, juveniles, attack, the, plant, and, settle, in, the, roots, however, infestation, seems, to, occur, at, lower, populations, compared, to, other, cruciferous, plants, root, symptoms, include, deformation, galls, and, injury, that, prevent, proper, water, and, nutrient, uptake, this, could, eventually, lead, to, stunting, wilting, and, chlorosis, of, the, shoots, the, false, root, knot, nematode, nacobbus, aberrans, has, a, wide, host, range, of, up, to, 84, species, including, many, weeds, on, brassicas, it, has, been, reported, in, several, states, including, nebraska, wyoming, utah, colorado, montana, south, dakota, and, kansas, manzanilla, l, pez, et, al, 2002, as, a, pest, of, collards, the, degree, of, damage, is, dependent, upon, the, nematode, population, in, the, soil, some, collard, cultivars, exhibit, resistance, to, bacterial, leaf, blight, incited, by, pseudomonas, cannabina, pv, alisalensis, pca, raw, collard, greens, are, 90, water, 6, carbohydrates, 3, protein, and, contain,
