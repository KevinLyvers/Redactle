myriapods, from, ancient, greek, mur, os, countless, and, po, s, foot, are, the, members, of, subphylum, myriapoda, containing, arthropods, such, as, millipedes, and, centipedes, the, group, contains, about, 13, 000, species, all, of, them, terrestrial, although, molecular, evidence, and, similar, fossils, suggests, a, diversification, in, the, cambrian, period, the, oldest, known, fossil, record, of, myriapods, dates, between, the, late, silurian, and, early, devonian, with, pneumodesmus, preserving, the, earliest, known, evidence, of, air, breathing, on, land, other, early, myriapod, fossil, species, around, the, similar, time, period, include, kampecaris, obanensis, and, archidesmus, sp, the, phylogenetic, classification, of, myriapods, is, still, debated, the, scientific, study, of, myriapods, is, myriapodology, and, those, who, study, myriapods, are, myriapodologists, myriapods, have, a, single, pair, of, antennae, and, in, most, cases, simple, eyes, exceptions, are, the, two, classes, symphylans, and, pauropods, and, the, millipede, order, polydesmida, and, the, centipede, order, geophilomorpha, which, are, all, eyeless, the, house, centipedes, scutigera, on, the, other, hand, have, large, and, well, developed, compound, eyes, the, mouthparts, lie, on, the, underside, of, the, head, with, an, epistome, and, labrum, forming, the, upper, lip, and, a, pair, of, maxillae, forming, the, lower, lip, a, pair, of, mandibles, lie, inside, the, mouth, myriapods, breathe, through, spiracles, that, connect, to, a, tracheal, system, similar, to, that, of, insects, there, is, a, long, tubular, heart, that, extends, through, much, of, the, body, but, usually, few, if, any, blood, vessels, malpighian, tubules, excrete, nitrogenous, waste, into, the, digestive, system, which, typically, consists, of, a, simple, tube, although, the, ventral, nerve, cord, has, a, ganglion, in, each, segment, the, brain, is, relatively, poorly, developed, during, mating, male, myriapods, produce, a, packet, of, sperm, or, spermatophore, which, they, must, transfer, to, the, female, externally, this, process, is, often, complex, and, highly, developed, the, female, lays, eggs, which, hatch, as, much, shortened, versions, of, the, adults, with, only, a, few, segments, and, as, few, as, three, pairs, of, legs, with, the, exception, of, the, two, centipede, orders, scolopendromorpha, and, geophilomorpha, which, have, epimorphic, development, all, body, segments, are, formed, segments, embryonically, the, young, add, additional, segments, and, limbs, as, they, repeatedly, moult, to, reach, the, adult, form, the, process, of, adding, new, segments, during, postembryonic, growth, is, known, as, anamorphosis, of, which, there, are, three, types, euanamorphosis, emianamorphosis, and, teloanamorphosis, in, euanamorphosis, every, moult, is, followed, by, addition, of, new, segments, even, after, reaching, sexual, maturity, in, emianamorphosis, new, segments, are, added, until, a, certain, stage, and, further, moults, happen, without, addition, of, segments, and, in, teloanamorphosis, where, the, addition, of, new, segments, stops, after, the, adult, form, is, reached, after, no, further, moults, occur, myriapods, are, most, abundant, in, moist, forests, where, they, fulfill, an, important, role, in, breaking, down, decaying, plant, material, although, a, few, live, in, grasslands, semi, arid, habitats, or, even, deserts, a, very, small, percentage, of, species, are, littoral, found, along, the, sea, shore, the, majority, are, detritivorous, with, the, exception, of, centipedes, which, are, chiefly, nocturnal, predators, a, few, species, of, centipedes, and, millipedes, are, able, to, produce, light, and, are, therefore, bioluminescent, pauropodans, and, symphylans, are, small, sometimes, microscopic, animals, that, resemble, centipedes, superficially, and, live, in, soils, millipedes, differ, from, the, other, groups, in, having, their, body, segments, fused, into, pairs, giving, the, appearance, that, each, segment, bears, two, pairs, of, legs, while, the, other, three, groups, have, a, single, pair, of, legs, on, each, body, segment, although, not, generally, considered, dangerous, to, humans, many, millipedes, produce, noxious, secretions, often, containing, benzoquinones, which, in, rare, cases, can, cause, temporary, blistering, and, discolouration, of, the, skin, large, centipedes, however, can, bite, humans, and, although, the, bite, may, cause, intense, pain, and, discomfort, fatalities, are, extremely, rare, there, has, been, much, debate, as, to, which, arthropod, group, is, most, closely, related, to, the, myriapoda, under, the, mandibulata, hypothesis, myriapoda, is, the, sister, taxon, to, pancrustacea, a, group, comprising, the, crustacea, and, hexapoda, insects, and, their, close, relatives, under, the, atelocerata, hypothesis, hexapoda, is, the, closest, whereas, under, the, paradoxopoda, hypothesis, chelicerata, is, the, closest, this, last, hypothesis, although, supported, by, few, if, any, morphological, characters, is, supported, by, a, number, of, molecular, studies, a, 2020, study, found, numerous, characters, of, the, eye, and, preoral, region, suggesting, that, the, closest, relatives, to, crown, myriapods, are, the, extinct, euthycarcinoids, there, are, four, classes, of, extant, myriapods, chilopoda, centipedes, diplopoda, pauropoda, and, symphyla, containing, a, total, of, around, 12, 000, species, while, each, of, these, groups, of, myriapods, is, believed, to, be, monophyletic, relationships, among, them, are, less, certain, centipedes, make, up, the, class, chilopoda, they, are, fast, predatory, and, venomous, hunting, mostly, at, night, there, are, around, 3, 300, species, ranging, from, the, diminutive, nannarrup, hoffmani, less, than, 12, mm, or, 1, 2, in, in, length, to, the, giant, scolopendra, gigantea, which, may, exceed, 30, centimetres, 12, in, millipedes, form, the, class, diplopoda, most, millipedes, are, slower, than, centipedes, and, feed, on, leaf, litter, and, detritus, except, for, the, first, segment, called, collum, which, don, t, have, any, appendages, and, the, next, three, segments, with, a, single, pair, of, legs, each, they, are, distinguished, by, the, fusion, of, each, pair, of, body, segments, into, a, single, unit, giving, the, appearance, of, having, two, pairs, of, legs, per, segment, it, is, also, common, for, the, sternites, pleurites, and, tergites, to, fuse, into, rigid, armour, rings, the, males, produce, aflagellate, sperm, cells, unlike, the, rest, of, the, myriapods, which, produce, flagellated, sperm, around, 12, 000, species, have, been, described, which, may, represent, less, than, a, tenth, of, the, true, global, millipede, diversity, although, the, name, millipede, is, a, compound, word, formed, from, the, latin, roots, millia, thousand, and, pes, gen, pedis, foot, millipedes, typically, have, between, 36, and, 400, legs, in, 2021, however, was, described, eumillipes, persephone, the, first, species, known, to, have, 1, 000, or, more, legs, possessing, 1, 306, of, them, pill, millipedes, are, much, shorter, and, are, capable, of, rolling, up, into, a, ball, like, pillbugs, symphylans, or, garden, centipedes, are, closely, related, to, centipedes, and, millipedes, they, are, 3, to, 6, cm, long, and, have, 6, to, 12, pairs, of, legs, depending, on, their, life, stage, their, eggs, which, are, white, and, spherical, and, covered, with, small, hexagonal, ridges, are, laid, in, batches, of, 4, to, 25, at, a, time, and, usually, take, up, to, 40, days, to, hatch, there, are, about, 200, species, worldwide, pauropoda, is, another, small, group, of, small, myriapods, they, are, typically, 0, 5, 2, 0, mm, long, and, live, in, the, soil, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, over, 700, species, have, been, described, they, are, believed, to, be, the, sister, group, to, millipedes, and, have, the, dorsal, tergites, fused, across, pairs, of, segments, similar, to, the, more, complete, fusion, of, segments, seen, in, millipedes, arthropleurideans, were, ancient, myriapods, that, are, now, extinct, known, from, the, late, silurian, to, the, permian, the, most, famous, members, are, from, the, genus, arthropleura, which, was, a, giant, probably, herbivorous, animal, that, could, be, up, to, 2, 63, metres, 8, ft, 8, in, long, but, the, group, also, includes, species, less, than, 1, cm, 0, 39, in, arthropleuridea, was, historically, considered, a, distinct, class, of, myriapods, but, since, 2000, scientific, consensus, has, viewed, the, group, as, a, subset, of, millipedes, although, the, relationship, of, arthropleurideans, to, other, millipedes, and, to, each, other, is, debated, a, variety, of, groupings, clades, of, the, myriapod, classes, have, been, proposed, some, of, which, are, mutually, exclusive, and, all, of, which, represent, hypotheses, of, evolutionary, relationships, traditional, relationships, supported, by, morphological, similarities, anatomical, or, developmental, similarities, are, challenged, by, newer, relationships, supported, by, molecular, evidence, including, dna, sequence, and, amino, acid, similarities
