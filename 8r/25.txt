human, evolution, is, the, evolutionary, process, within, the, history, of, primates, that, led, to, the, emergence, of, homo, sapiens, as, a, distinct, species, of, the, hominid, family, that, includes, all, the, great, apes, this, process, involved, the, gradual, development, of, traits, such, as, human, bipedalism, dexterity, and, complex, language, as, well, as, interbreeding, with, other, hominins, a, tribe, of, the, african, hominid, subfamily, indicating, that, human, evolution, was, not, linear, but, weblike, the, study, of, the, origins, of, humans, involves, several, scientific, disciplines, including, physical, and, evolutionary, anthropology, paleontology, and, genetics, the, field, is, also, known, by, the, terms, anthropogeny, anthropogenesis, and, anthropogony, the, latter, two, terms, are, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, the, related, subject, of, hominization, primates, diverged, from, other, mammals, about, 85, million, years, ago, mya, in, the, late, cretaceous, period, with, their, earliest, fossils, appearing, over, 55, mya, during, the, paleocene, primates, produced, successive, clades, leading, to, the, ape, superfamily, which, gave, rise, to, the, hominid, and, the, gibbon, families, these, diverged, some, 15, 20, mya, african, and, asian, hominids, including, orangutans, diverged, about, 14, mya, hominins, including, the, australopithecine, and, panina, subtribes, parted, from, the, gorillini, tribe, gorillas, between, 8, and, 9, mya, australopithecine, including, the, extinct, biped, ancestors, of, humans, separated, from, the, pan, genus, containing, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, 4, 7, mya, the, homo, genus, is, evidenced, by, the, appearance, of, h, habilis, over, 2, mya, while, anatomically, modern, humans, emerged, in, africa, approximately, 300, 000, years, ago, the, evolutionary, history, of, primates, can, be, traced, back, 65, million, years, one, of, the, oldest, known, primate, like, mammal, species, the, plesiadapis, came, from, north, america, another, archicebus, came, from, china, other, similar, basal, primates, were, widespread, in, eurasia, and, africa, during, the, tropical, conditions, of, the, paleocene, and, eocene, david, r, begun, concluded, that, early, primates, flourished, in, eurasia, and, that, a, lineage, leading, to, the, african, apes, and, humans, including, to, dryopithecus, migrated, south, from, europe, or, western, asia, into, africa, the, surviving, tropical, population, of, primates, which, is, seen, most, completely, in, the, upper, eocene, and, lowermost, oligocene, fossil, beds, of, the, faiyum, depression, southwest, of, cairo, gave, rise, to, all, extant, primate, species, including, the, lemurs, of, madagascar, lorises, of, southeast, asia, galagos, or, bush, babies, of, africa, and, to, the, anthropoids, which, are, the, platyrrhines, or, new, world, monkeys, the, catarrhines, or, old, world, monkeys, and, the, great, apes, including, humans, and, other, hominids, the, earliest, known, catarrhine, is, kamoyapithecus, from, the, uppermost, oligocene, at, eragaleit, in, the, northern, great, rift, valley, in, kenya, dated, to, 24, million, years, ago, its, ancestry, is, thought, to, be, species, related, to, aegyptopithecus, propliopithecus, and, parapithecus, from, the, faiyum, at, around, 35, mya, in, 2010, saadanius, was, described, as, a, close, relative, of, the, last, common, ancestor, of, the, crown, catarrhines, and, tentatively, dated, to, 29, 28, mya, helping, to, fill, an, 11, million, year, gap, in, the, fossil, record, in, the, early, miocene, about, 22, million, years, ago, the, many, kinds, of, arboreally, adapted, tree, dwelling, primitive, catarrhines, from, east, africa, suggest, a, long, history, of, prior, diversification, fossils, at, 20, million, years, ago, include, fragments, attributed, to, victoriapithecus, the, earliest, old, world, monkey, among, the, genera, thought, to, be, in, the, ape, lineage, leading, up, to, 13, million, years, ago, are, proconsul, rangwapithecus, dendropithecus, limnopithecus, nacholapithecus, equatorius, nyanzapithecus, afropithecus, heliopithecus, and, kenyapithecus, all, from, east, africa, the, presence, of, other, generalized, non, cercopithecids, of, middle, miocene, from, sites, far, distant, such, as, otavipithecus, from, cave, deposits, in, namibia, and, pierolapithecus, and, dryopithecus, from, france, spain, and, austria, is, evidence, of, a, wide, diversity, of, forms, across, africa, and, the, mediterranean, basin, during, the, relatively, warm, and, equable, climatic, regimes, of, the, early, and, middle, miocene, the, youngest, of, the, miocene, hominoids, oreopithecus, is, from, coal, beds, in, italy, that, have, been, dated, to, 9, million, years, ago, in, 2023, an, analysis, of, anadoluvius, turkae, from, 8, 7, million, years, ago, led, the, researchers, of, the, study, to, conclude, that, hominids, originated, in, europe, with, the, eastern, mediterranean, hominids, originating, from, earlier, central, and, western, european, hominids, the, authors, state, that, the, oldest, known, hominines, are, european, and, also, stating, that, the, more, likely, and, more, parsimonious, interpretation, is, that, hominines, evolved, over, a, lengthy, period, in, europe, and, dispersed, into, africa, before, 7, ma, molecular, evidence, indicates, that, the, lineage, of, gibbons, diverged, from, the, line, of, great, apes, some, 18, 12, mya, and, that, of, orangutans, subfamily, ponginae, diverged, from, the, other, great, apes, at, about, 12, million, years, there, are, no, fossils, that, clearly, document, the, ancestry, of, gibbons, which, may, have, originated, in, a, so, far, unknown, southeast, asian, hominoid, population, but, fossil, proto, orangutans, may, be, represented, by, sivapithecus, from, india, and, griphopithecus, from, turkey, dated, to, around, 10, mya, hominidae, subfamily, homininae, african, hominids, diverged, from, ponginae, orangutans, about, 14, mya, hominins, including, humans, and, the, australopithecine, and, panina, subtribes, parted, from, the, gorillini, tribe, gorillas, between, 8, and, 9, mya, australopithecine, including, the, extinct, biped, ancestors, of, humans, separated, from, the, pan, genus, containing, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, 4, 7, mya, the, homo, genus, is, evidenced, by, the, appearance, of, h, habilis, over, 2, mya, while, anatomically, modern, humans, emerged, in, africa, approximately, 300, 000, years, ago, species, close, to, the, last, common, ancestor, of, gorillas, chimpanzees, and, humans, may, be, represented, by, nakalipithecus, fossils, found, in, kenya, and, ouranopithecus, found, in, greece, molecular, evidence, suggests, that, between, 8, and, 4, million, years, ago, first, the, gorillas, and, then, the, chimpanzees, genus, pan, split, off, from, the, line, leading, to, the, humans, human, dna, is, approximately, 98, 4, identical, to, that, of, chimpanzees, when, comparing, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, see, human, evolutionary, genetics, the, fossil, record, however, of, gorillas, and, chimpanzees, is, limited, both, poor, preservation, rain, forest, soils, tend, to, be, acidic, and, dissolve, bone, and, sampling, bias, probably, contribute, to, this, problem, other, hominins, probably, adapted, to, the, drier, environments, outside, the, equatorial, belt, and, there, they, encountered, antelope, hyenas, dogs, pigs, elephants, horses, and, others, the, equatorial, belt, contracted, after, about, 8, million, years, ago, and, there, is, very, little, fossil, evidence, for, the, split, thought, to, have, occurred, around, that, time, of, the, hominin, lineage, from, the, lineages, of, gorillas, and, chimpanzees, the, earliest, fossils, argued, by, some, to, belong, to, the, human, lineage, are, sahelanthropus, tchadensis, 7, ma, and, orrorin, tugenensis, 6, ma, followed, by, ardipithecus, 5, 5, 4, 4, ma, with, species, ar, kadabba, and, ar, ramidus, it, has, been, argued, in, a, study, of, the, life, history, of, ar, ramidus, that, the, species, provides, evidence, for, a, suite, of, anatomical, and, behavioral, adaptations, in, very, early, hominins, unlike, any, species, of, extant, great, ape, this, study, demonstrated, affinities, between, the, skull, morphology, of, ar, ramidus, and, that, of, infant, and, juvenile, chimpanzees, suggesting, the, species, evolved, a, juvenalised, or, paedomorphic, craniofacial, morphology, via, heterochronic, dissociation, of, growth, trajectories, it, was, also, argued, that, the, species, provides, support, for, the, notion, that, very, early, hominins, akin, to, bonobos, pan, paniscus, the, less, aggressive, species, of, the, genus, pan, may, have, evolved, via, the, process, of, self, domestication, consequently, arguing, against, the, so, called, chimpanzee, referential, model, the, authors, suggest, it, is, no, longer, tenable, to, use, chimpanzee, pan, troglodytes, social, and, mating, behaviors, in, models, of, early, hominin, social, evolution, when, commenting, on, the, absence, of, aggressive, canine, morphology, in, ar, ramidus, and, the, implications, this, has, for, the, evolution, of, hominin, social, psychology, they, wrote, of, course, ar, ramidus, differs, significantly, from, bonobos, bonobos, having, retained, a, functional, canine, honing, complex, however, the, fact, that, ar, ramidus, shares, with, bonobos, reduced, sexual, dimorphism, and, a, more, paedomorphic, form, relative, to, chimpanzees, suggests, that, the, developmental, and, social, adaptations, evident, in, bonobos, may, be, of, assistance, in, future, reconstructions, of, early, hominin, social, and, sexual, psychology, in, fact, the, trend, towards, increased, maternal, care, female, mate, selection, and, self, domestication, may, have, been, stronger, and, more, refined, in, ar, ramidus, than, what, we, see, in, bonobos, 128, the, authors, argue, that, many, of, the, basic, human, adaptations, evolved, in, the, ancient, forest, and, woodland, ecosystems, of, late, miocene, and, early, pliocene, africa, consequently, they, argue, that, humans, may, not, represent, evolution, from, a, chimpanzee, like, ancestor, as, has, traditionally, been, supposed, this, suggests, many, modern, human, adaptations, represent, phylogenetically, deep, traits, and, that, the, behavior, and, morphology, of, chimpanzees, may, have, evolved, subsequent, to, the, split, with, the, common, ancestor, they, share, with, humans, the, genus, australopithecus, evolved, in, eastern, africa, around, 4, million, years, ago, before, spreading, throughout, the, continent, and, eventually, becoming, extinct, 2, million, years, ago, during, this, time, period, various, forms, of, australopiths, existed, including, australopithecus, anamensis, a, afarensis, a, sediba, and, a, africanus, there, is, still, some, debate, among, academics, whether, certain, african, hominid, species, of, this, time, such, as, a, robustus, and, a, boisei, constitute, members, of, the, same, genus, if, so, they, would, be, considered, to, be, robust, australopiths, while, the, others, would, be, considered, gracile, australopiths, however, if, these, species, do, indeed, constitute, their, own, genus, then, they, may, be, given, their, own, name, paranthropus, a, new, proposed, species, australopithecus, deyiremeda, is, claimed, to, have, been, discovered, living, at, the, same, time, period, of, a, afarensis, there, is, debate, whether, a, deyiremeda, is, a, new, species, or, is, a, afarensis, australopithecus, prometheus, otherwise, known, as, little, foot, has, recently, been, dated, at, 3, 67, million, years, old, through, a, new, dating, technique, making, the, genus, australopithecus, as, old, as, afarensis, given, the, opposable, big, toe, found, on, little, foot, it, seems, that, the, specimen, was, a, good, climber, it, is, thought, given, the, night, predators, of, the, region, that, he, built, a, nesting, platform, at, night, in, the, trees, in, a, similar, fashion, to, chimpanzees, and, gorillas, the, earliest, documented, representative, of, the, genus, homo, is, homo, habilis, which, evolved, around, 2, 8, million, years, ago, and, is, arguably, the, earliest, species, for, which, there, is, positive, evidence, of, the, use, of, stone, tools, the, brains, of, these, early, hominins, were, about, the, same, size, as, that, of, a, chimpanzee, although, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, was, the, time, in, which, the, human, srgap2, gene, doubled, producing, a, more, rapid, wiring, of, the, frontal, cortex, during, the, next, million, years, a, process, of, rapid, encephalization, occurred, and, with, the, arrival, of, homo, erectus, and, homo, ergaster, in, the, fossil, record, cranial, capacity, had, doubled, to, 850, cm, 3, such, an, increase, in, human, brain, size, is, equivalent, to, each, generation, having, 125, 000, more, neurons, than, their, parents, it, is, believed, that, h, erectus, and, h, ergaster, were, the, first, to, use, fire, and, complex, tools, and, were, the, first, of, the, hominin, line, to, leave, africa, spreading, throughout, africa, asia, and, europe, between, 1, 3, to, 1, 8, million, years, ago, according, to, the, recent, african, origin, theory, modern, humans, evolved, in, africa, possibly, from, h, heidelbergensis, h, rhodesiensis, or, h, antecessor, and, migrated, out, of, the, continent, some, 50, 000, to, 100, 000, years, ago, gradually, replacing, local, populations, of, h, erectus, denisova, hominins, h, floresiensis, h, luzonensis, and, h, neanderthalensis, whose, ancestors, had, left, africa, in, earlier, migrations, archaic, homo, sapiens, the, forerunner, of, anatomically, modern, humans, evolved, in, the, middle, paleolithic, between, 400, 000, and, 250, 000, years, ago, recent, dna, evidence, suggests, that, several, haplotypes, of, neanderthal, origin, are, present, among, all, non, african, populations, and, neanderthals, and, other, hominins, such, as, denisovans, may, have, contributed, up, to, 6, of, their, genome, to, present, day, humans, suggestive, of, a, limited, interbreeding, between, these, species, according, to, some, anthropologists, the, transition, to, behavioral, modernity, with, the, development, of, symbolic, culture, language, and, specialized, lithic, technology, happened, around, 50, 000, years, ago, beginning, of, the, upper, paleolithic, although, others, point, to, evidence, of, a, gradual, change, over, a, longer, time, span, during, the, middle, paleolithic, homo, sapiens, is, the, only, extant, species, of, its, genus, homo, while, some, extinct, homo, species, might, have, been, ancestors, of, homo, sapiens, many, perhaps, most, were, likely, cousins, having, speciated, away, from, the, ancestral, hominin, line, there, is, yet, no, consensus, as, to, which, of, these, groups, should, be, considered, a, separate, species, and, which, should, be, subspecies, this, may, be, due, to, the, dearth, of, fossils, or, to, the, slight, differences, used, to, classify, species, in, the, genus, homo, the, sahara, pump, theory, describing, an, occasionally, passable, wet, sahara, desert, provides, one, possible, explanation, of, the, intermittent, migration, and, speciation, in, the, genus, homo, based, on, archaeological, and, paleontological, evidence, it, has, been, possible, to, infer, to, some, extent, the, ancient, dietary, practices, of, various, homo, species, and, to, study, the, role, of, diet, in, physical, and, behavioral, evolution, within, homo, some, anthropologists, and, archaeologists, subscribe, to, the, toba, catastrophe, theory, which, posits, that, the, supereruption, of, lake, toba, on, sumatran, island, in, indonesia, some, 70, 000, years, ago, caused, global, starvation, killing, the, majority, of, humans, and, creating, a, population, bottleneck, that, affected, the, genetic, inheritance, of, all, humans, today, the, genetic, and, archaeological, evidence, for, this, remains, in, question, however, a, 2023, genetic, study, suggests, that, a, similar, human, population, bottleneck, of, between, 1, 000, and, 100, 000, survivors, occurred, around, 930, 000, and, 813, 000, years, ago, lasted, for, about, 117, 000, years, and, brought, human, ancestors, close, to, extinction, homo, habilis, lived, from, about, 2, 8, to, 1, 4, ma, the, species, evolved, in, south, and, east, africa, in, the, late, pliocene, or, early, pleistocene, 2, 5, 2, ma, when, it, diverged, from, the, australopithecines, with, the, development, of, smaller, molars, and, larger, brains, one, of, the, first, known, hominins, it, made, tools, from, stone, and, perhaps, animal, bones, leading, to, its, name, homo, habilis, latin, handy, man, bestowed, by, discoverer, louis, leakey, some, scientists, have, proposed, moving, this, species, from, homo, into, australopithecus, due, to, the, morphology, of, its, skeleton, being, more, adapted, to, living, in, trees, rather, than, walking, on, two, legs, like, later, hominins, in, may, 2010, a, new, species, homo, gautengensis, was, discovered, in, south, africa, these, are, proposed, species, names, for, fossils, from, about, 1, 9, 1, 6, ma, whose, relation, to, homo, habilis, is, not, yet, clear, the, first, fossils, of, homo, erectus, were, discovered, by, dutch, physician, eugene, dubois, in, 1891, on, the, indonesian, island, of, java, he, originally, named, the, material, anthropopithecus, erectus, 1892, 1893, considered, at, this, point, as, a, chimpanzee, like, fossil, primate, and, pithecanthropus, erectus, 1893, 1894, changing, his, mind, as, of, based, on, its, morphology, which, he, considered, to, be, intermediate, between, that, of, humans, and, apes, years, later, in, the, 20th, century, the, german, physician, and, paleoanthropologist, franz, weidenreich, 1873, 1948, compared, in, detail, the, characters, of, dubois, java, man, then, named, pithecanthropus, erectus, with, the, characters, of, the, peking, man, then, named, sinanthropus, pekinensis, weidenreich, concluded, in, 1940, that, because, of, their, anatomical, similarity, with, modern, humans, it, was, necessary, to, gather, all, these, specimens, of, java, and, china, in, a, single, species, of, the, genus, homo, the, species, h, erectus, homo, erectus, lived, from, about, 1, 8, ma, to, about, 70, 000, years, ago, which, would, indicate, that, they, were, probably, wiped, out, by, the, toba, catastrophe, however, nearby, h, floresiensis, survived, it, the, early, phase, of, h, erectus, from, 1, 8, to, 1, 25, ma, is, considered, by, some, to, be, a, separate, species, h, ergaster, or, as, h, erectus, ergaster, a, subspecies, of, h, erectus, many, paleoanthropologists, now, use, the, term, homo, ergaster, for, the, non, asian, forms, of, this, group, and, reserve, h, erectus, only, for, those, fossils, that, are, found, in, asia, and, meet, certain, skeletal, and, dental, requirements, which, differ, slightly, from, h, ergaster, in, africa, in, the, early, pleistocene, 1, 5, 1, ma, some, populations, of, homo, habilis, are, thought, to, have, evolved, larger, brains, and, to, have, made, more, elaborate, stone, tools, these, differences, and, others, are, sufficient, for, anthropologists, to, classify, them, as, a, new, species, homo, erectus, in, africa, the, evolution, of, locking, knees, and, the, movement, of, the, foramen, magnum, are, thought, to, be, likely, drivers, of, the, larger, population, changes, this, species, also, may, have, used, fire, to, cook, meat, richard, wrangham, notes, that, homo, seems, to, have, been, ground, dwelling, with, reduced, intestinal, length, smaller, dentition, and, brains, to, their, current, horrendously, fuel, inefficient, size, and, hypothesizes, that, control, of, fire, and, cooking, which, released, increased, nutritional, value, was, the, key, adaptation, that, separated, homo, from, tree, sleeping, australopithecines, these, are, proposed, as, species, intermediate, between, h, erectus, and, h, heidelbergensis, h, heidelbergensis, heidelberg, man, lived, from, about, 800, 000, to, about, 300, 000, years, ago, also, proposed, as, homo, sapiens, heidelbergensis, or, homo, sapiens, paleohungaricus, homo, neanderthalensis, alternatively, designated, as, homo, sapiens, neanderthalensis, lived, in, europe, and, asia, from, 400, 000, to, about, 28, 000, years, ago, there, are, a, number, of, clear, anatomical, differences, between, anatomically, modern, humans, amh, and, neanderthal, specimens, many, relating, to, the, superior, neanderthal, adaptation, to, cold, environments, neanderthal, surface, to, volume, ratio, was, even, lower, than, that, among, modern, inuit, populations, indicating, superior, retention, of, body, heat, neanderthals, also, had, significantly, larger, brains, as, shown, from, brain, endocasts, casting, doubt, on, their, intellectual, inferiority, to, modern, humans, however, the, higher, body, mass, of, neanderthals, may, have, required, larger, brain, mass, for, body, control, also, recent, research, by, pearce, stringer, and, dunbar, has, shown, important, differences, in, brain, architecture, the, larger, size, of, the, neanderthal, orbital, chamber, and, occipital, lobe, suggests, that, they, had, a, better, visual, acuity, than, modern, humans, useful, in, the, dimmer, light, of, glacial, europe, neanderthals, may, have, had, less, brain, capacity, available, for, social, functions, inferring, social, group, size, from, endocranial, volume, minus, occipital, lobe, size, suggests, that, neanderthal, groups, may, have, been, limited, to, 120, individuals, compared, to, 144, possible, relationships, for, modern, humans, larger, social, groups, could, imply, that, modern, humans, had, less, risk, of, inbreeding, within, their, clan, trade, over, larger, areas, confirmed, in, the, distribution, of, stone, tools, and, faster, spread, of, social, and, technological, innovations, all, these, may, have, all, contributed, to, modern, homo, sapiens, replacing, neanderthal, populations, by, 28, 000, bp, earlier, evidence, from, sequencing, mitochondrial, dna, suggested, that, no, significant, gene, flow, occurred, between, h, neanderthalensis, and, h, sapiens, and, that, the, two, were, separate, species, that, shared, a, common, ancestor, about, 660, 000, years, ago, however, a, sequencing, of, the, neanderthal, genome, in, 2010, indicated, that, neanderthals, did, indeed, interbreed, with, anatomically, modern, humans, c, 45, 000, 80, 000, years, ago, around, the, time, modern, humans, migrated, out, from, africa, but, before, they, dispersed, throughout, europe, asia, and, elsewhere, the, genetic, sequencing, of, a, 40, 000, year, old, human, skeleton, from, romania, showed, that, 11, of, its, genome, was, neanderthal, implying, the, individual, had, a, neanderthal, ancestor, 4, 6, generations, previously, in, addition, to, a, contribution, from, earlier, interbreeding, in, the, middle, east, though, this, interbred, romanian, population, seems, not, to, have, been, ancestral, to, modern, humans, the, finding, indicates, that, interbreeding, happened, repeatedly, all, modern, non, african, humans, have, about, 1, to, 4, or, 1, 5, to, 2, 6, by, more, recent, data, of, their, dna, derived, from, neanderthals, this, finding, is, consistent, with, recent, studies, indicating, that, the, divergence, of, some, human, alleles, dates, to, one, ma, although, this, interpretation, has, been, questioned, neanderthals, and, amh, homo, sapiens, could, have, co, existed, in, europe, for, as, long, as, 10, 000, years, during, which, amh, populations, exploded, vastly, outnumbering, neanderthals, possibly, outcompeting, them, by, sheer, numbers, in, 2008, archaeologists, working, at, the, site, of, denisova, cave, in, the, altai, mountains, of, siberia, uncovered, a, small, bone, fragment, from, the, fifth, finger, of, a, juvenile, member, of, another, human, species, the, denisovans, artifacts, including, a, bracelet, excavated, in, the, cave, at, the, same, level, were, carbon, dated, to, around, 40, 000, bp, as, dna, had, survived, in, the, fossil, fragment, due, to, the, cool, climate, of, the, denisova, cave, both, mtdna, and, nuclear, dna, were, sequenced, while, the, divergence, point, of, the, mtdna, was, unexpectedly, deep, in, time, the, full, genomic, sequence, suggested, the, denisovans, belonged, to, the, same, lineage, as, neanderthals, with, the, two, diverging, shortly, after, their, line, split, from, the, lineage, that, gave, rise, to, modern, humans, modern, humans, are, known, to, have, overlapped, with, neanderthals, in, europe, and, the, near, east, for, possibly, more, than, 40, 000, years, and, the, discovery, raises, the, possibility, that, neanderthals, denisovans, and, modern, humans, may, have, co, existed, and, interbred, the, existence, of, this, distant, branch, creates, a, much, more, complex, picture, of, humankind, during, the, late, pleistocene, than, previously, thought, evidence, has, also, been, found, that, as, much, as, 6, of, the, dna, of, some, modern, melanesians, derive, from, denisovans, indicating, limited, interbreeding, in, southeast, asia, alleles, thought, to, have, originated, in, neanderthals, and, denisovans, have, been, identified, at, several, genetic, loci, in, the, genomes, of, modern, humans, outside, africa, hla, haplotypes, from, denisovans, and, neanderthal, represent, more, than, half, the, hla, alleles, of, modern, eurasians, indicating, strong, positive, selection, for, these, introgressed, alleles, corinne, simoneti, at, vanderbilt, university, in, nashville, and, her, team, have, found, from, medical, records, of, 28, 000, people, of, european, descent, that, the, presence, of, neanderthal, dna, segments, may, be, associated, with, a, higher, rate, of, depression, the, flow, of, genes, from, neanderthal, populations, to, modern, humans, was, not, all, one, way, sergi, castellano, of, the, max, planck, institute, for, evolutionary, anthropology, reported, in, 2016, that, while, denisovan, and, neanderthal, genomes, are, more, related, to, each, other, than, they, are, to, us, siberian, neanderthal, genomes, show, more, similarity, to, modern, human, genes, than, do, european, neanderthal, populations, this, suggests, neanderthal, populations, interbred, with, modern, humans, around, 100, 000, years, ago, probably, somewhere, in, the, near, east, studies, of, a, neanderthal, child, at, gibraltar, show, from, brain, development, and, tooth, eruption, that, neanderthal, children, may, have, matured, more, rapidly, than, homo, sapiens, h, floresiensis, which, lived, from, approximately, 190, 000, to, 50, 000, years, before, present, bp, has, been, nicknamed, the, hobbit, for, its, small, size, possibly, a, result, of, insular, dwarfism, h, floresiensis, is, intriguing, both, for, its, size, and, its, age, being, an, example, of, a, recent, species, of, the, genus, homo, that, exhibits, derived, traits, not, shared, with, modern, humans, in, other, words, h, floresiensis, shares, a, common, ancestor, with, modern, humans, but, split, from, the, modern, human, lineage, and, followed, a, distinct, evolutionary, path, the, main, find, was, a, skeleton, believed, to, be, a, woman, of, about, 30, years, of, age, found, in, 2003, it, has, been, dated, to, approximately, 18, 000, years, old, the, living, woman, was, estimated, to, be, one, meter, in, height, with, a, brain, volume, of, just, 380, cm, 3, considered, small, for, a, chimpanzee, and, less, than, a, third, of, the, h, sapiens, average, of, 1400, cm, 3, however, there, is, an, ongoing, debate, over, whether, h, floresiensis, is, indeed, a, separate, species, some, scientists, hold, that, h, floresiensis, was, a, modern, h, sapiens, with, pathological, dwarfism, this, hypothesis, is, supported, in, part, because, some, modern, humans, who, live, on, flores, the, indonesian, island, where, the, skeleton, was, found, are, pygmies, this, coupled, with, pathological, dwarfism, could, have, resulted, in, a, significantly, diminutive, human, the, other, major, attack, on, h, floresiensis, as, a, separate, species, is, that, it, was, found, with, tools, only, associated, with, h, sapiens, the, hypothesis, of, pathological, dwarfism, however, fails, to, explain, additional, anatomical, features, that, are, unlike, those, of, modern, humans, diseased, or, not, but, much, like, those, of, ancient, members, of, our, genus, aside, from, cranial, features, these, features, include, the, form, of, bones, in, the, wrist, forearm, shoulder, knees, and, feet, additionally, this, hypothesis, fails, to, explain, the, find, of, multiple, examples, of, individuals, with, these, same, characteristics, indicating, they, were, common, to, a, large, population, and, not, limited, to, one, individual, in, 2016, fossil, teeth, and, a, partial, jaw, from, hominins, assumed, to, be, ancestral, to, h, floresiensis, were, discovered, at, mata, menge, about, 74, km, 46, mi, from, liang, bua, they, date, to, about, 700, 000, years, ago, and, are, noted, by, australian, archaeologist, gerrit, van, den, bergh, for, being, even, smaller, than, the, later, fossils, a, small, number, of, specimens, from, the, island, of, luzon, dated, 50, 000, to, 67, 000, years, ago, have, recently, been, assigned, by, their, discoverers, based, on, dental, characteristics, to, a, novel, human, species, h, luzonensis, h, sapiens, the, adjective, sapiens, is, latin, for, wise, or, intelligent, emerged, in, africa, around, 300, 000, years, ago, likely, derived, from, h, heidelbergensis, or, a, related, lineage, in, september, 2019, scientists, reported, the, computerized, determination, based, on, 260, ct, scans, of, a, virtual, skull, shape, of, the, last, common, human, ancestor, to, modern, humans, h, sapiens, representative, of, the, earliest, modern, humans, and, suggested, that, modern, humans, arose, between, 260, 000, and, 350, 000, years, ago, through, a, merging, of, populations, in, east, and, south, africa, between, 400, 000, years, ago, and, the, second, interglacial, period, in, the, middle, pleistocene, around, 250, 000, years, ago, the, trend, in, intra, cranial, volume, expansion, and, the, elaboration, of, stone, tool, technologies, developed, providing, evidence, for, a, transition, from, h, erectus, to, h, sapiens, the, direct, evidence, suggests, there, was, a, migration, of, h, erectus, out, of, africa, then, a, further, speciation, of, h, sapiens, from, h, erectus, in, africa, a, subsequent, migration, both, within, and, out, of, africa, eventually, replaced, the, earlier, dispersed, h, erectus, this, migration, and, origin, theory, is, usually, referred, to, as, the, recent, single, origin, hypothesis, or, out, of, africa, theory, h, sapiens, interbred, with, archaic, humans, both, in, africa, and, in, eurasia, in, eurasia, notably, with, neanderthals, and, denisovans, the, toba, catastrophe, theory, which, postulates, a, population, bottleneck, for, h, sapiens, about, 70, 000, years, ago, was, controversial, from, its, first, proposal, in, the, 1990s, and, by, the, 2010s, had, very, little, support, distinctive, human, genetic, variability, has, arisen, as, the, result, of, the, founder, effect, by, archaic, admixture, and, by, recent, evolutionary, pressures, since, homo, sapiens, separated, from, its, last, common, ancestor, shared, with, chimpanzees, human, evolution, is, characterized, by, a, number, of, morphological, developmental, physiological, behavioral, and, environmental, changes, environmental, cultural, evolution, discovered, much, later, during, the, pleistocene, played, a, significant, role, in, human, evolution, observed, via, human, transitions, between, subsistence, systems, the, most, significant, of, these, adaptations, are, bipedalism, increased, brain, size, lengthened, ontogeny, gestation, and, infancy, and, decreased, sexual, dimorphism, the, relationship, between, these, changes, is, the, subject, of, ongoing, debate, other, significant, morphological, changes, included, the, evolution, of, a, power, and, precision, grip, a, change, first, occurring, in, h, erectus, bipedalism, walking, on, two, legs, is, the, basic, adaptation, of, the, hominid, and, is, considered, the, main, cause, behind, a, suite, of, skeletal, changes, shared, by, all, bipedal, hominids, the, earliest, hominin, of, presumably, primitive, bipedalism, is, considered, to, be, either, sahelanthropus, or, orrorin, both, of, which, arose, some, 6, to, 7, million, years, ago, the, non, bipedal, knuckle, walkers, the, gorillas, and, chimpanzees, diverged, from, the, hominin, line, over, a, period, covering, the, same, time, so, either, sahelanthropus, or, orrorin, may, be, our, last, shared, ancestor, ardipithecus, a, full, biped, arose, approximately, 5, 6, million, years, ago, the, early, bipeds, eventually, evolved, into, the, australopithecines, and, still, later, into, the, genus, homo, there, are, several, theories, of, the, adaptation, value, of, bipedalism, it, is, possible, that, bipedalism, was, favored, because, it, freed, the, hands, for, reaching, and, carrying, food, saved, energy, during, locomotion, enabled, long, distance, running, and, hunting, provided, an, enhanced, field, of, vision, and, helped, avoid, hyperthermia, by, reducing, the, surface, area, exposed, to, direct, sun, features, all, advantageous, for, thriving, in, the, new, savanna, and, woodland, environment, created, as, a, result, of, the, east, african, rift, valley, uplift, versus, the, previous, closed, forest, habitat, a, 2007, study, provides, support, for, the, hypothesis, that, bipedalism, evolved, because, it, used, less, energy, than, quadrupedal, knuckle, walking, however, recent, studies, suggest, that, bipedality, without, the, ability, to, use, fire, would, not, have, allowed, global, dispersal, this, change, in, gait, saw, a, lengthening, of, the, legs, proportionately, when, compared, to, the, length, of, the, arms, which, were, shortened, through, the, removal, of, the, need, for, brachiation, another, change, is, the, shape, of, the, big, toe, recent, studies, suggest, that, australopithecines, still, lived, part, of, the, time, in, trees, as, a, result, of, maintaining, a, grasping, big, toe, this, was, progressively, lost, in, habilines, anatomically, the, evolution, of, bipedalism, has, been, accompanied, by, a, large, number, of, skeletal, changes, not, just, to, the, legs, and, pelvis, but, also, to, the, vertebral, column, feet, and, ankles, and, skull, the, femur, evolved, into, a, slightly, more, angular, position, to, move, the, center, of, gravity, toward, the, geometric, center, of, the, body, the, knee, and, ankle, joints, became, increasingly, robust, to, better, support, increased, weight, to, support, the, increased, weight, on, each, vertebra, in, the, upright, position, the, human, vertebral, column, became, s, shaped, and, the, lumbar, vertebrae, became, shorter, and, wider, in, the, feet, the, big, toe, moved, into, alignment, with, the, other, toes, to, help, in, forward, locomotion, the, arms, and, forearms, shortened, relative, to, the, legs, making, it, easier, to, run, the, foramen, magnum, migrated, under, the, skull, and, more, anterior, the, most, significant, changes, occurred, in, the, pelvic, region, where, the, long, downward, facing, iliac, blade, was, shortened, and, widened, as, a, requirement, for, keeping, the, center, of, gravity, stable, while, walking, bipedal, hominids, have, a, shorter, but, broader, bowl, like, pelvis, due, to, this, a, drawback, is, that, the, birth, canal, of, bipedal, apes, is, smaller, than, in, knuckle, walking, apes, though, there, has, been, a, widening, of, it, in, comparison, to, that, of, australopithecine, and, modern, humans, thus, permitting, the, passage, of, newborns, due, to, the, increase, in, cranial, size, this, is, limited, to, the, upper, portion, since, further, increase, can, hinder, normal, bipedal, movement, the, shortening, of, the, pelvis, and, smaller, birth, canal, evolved, as, a, requirement, for, bipedalism, and, had, significant, effects, on, the, process, of, human, birth, which, is, much, more, difficult, in, modern, humans, than, in, other, primates, during, human, birth, because, of, the, variation, in, size, of, the, pelvic, region, the, fetal, head, must, be, in, a, transverse, position, compared, to, the, mother, during, entry, into, the, birth, canal, and, rotate, about, 90, degrees, upon, exit, the, smaller, birth, canal, became, a, limiting, factor, to, brain, size, increases, in, early, humans, and, prompted, a, shorter, gestation, period, leading, to, the, relative, immaturity, of, human, offspring, who, are, unable, to, walk, much, before, 12, months, and, have, greater, neoteny, compared, to, other, primates, who, are, mobile, at, a, much, earlier, age, the, increased, brain, growth, after, birth, and, the, increased, dependency, of, children, on, mothers, had, a, major, effect, upon, the, female, reproductive, cycle, and, the, more, frequent, appearance, of, alloparenting, in, humans, when, compared, with, other, hominids, delayed, human, sexual, maturity, also, led, to, the, evolution, of, menopause, with, one, explanation, the, grandmother, hypothesis, providing, that, elderly, women, could, better, pass, on, their, genes, by, taking, care, of, their, daughter, s, offspring, as, compared, to, having, more, children, of, their, own, the, human, species, eventually, developed, a, much, larger, brain, than, that, of, other, primates, typically, 1, 330, cm, 3, 81, cu, in, in, modern, humans, nearly, three, times, the, size, of, a, chimpanzee, or, gorilla, brain, after, a, period, of, stasis, with, australopithecus, anamensis, and, ardipithecus, species, which, had, smaller, brains, as, a, result, of, their, bipedal, locomotion, the, pattern, of, encephalization, started, with, homo, habilis, whose, 600, cm, 3, 37, cu, in, brain, was, slightly, larger, than, that, of, chimpanzees, this, evolution, continued, in, homo, erectus, with, 800, 1, 100, cm, 3, 49, 67, cu, in, and, reached, a, maximum, in, neanderthals, with, 1, 200, 1, 900, cm, 3, 73, 116, cu, in, larger, even, than, modern, homo, sapiens, this, brain, increase, manifested, during, postnatal, brain, growth, far, exceeding, that, of, other, apes, heterochrony, it, also, allowed, for, extended, periods, of, social, learning, and, language, acquisition, in, juvenile, humans, beginning, as, much, as, 2, million, years, ago, encephalization, may, be, due, to, a, dependency, on, calorie, dense, difficult, to, acquire, food, furthermore, the, changes, in, the, structure, of, human, brains, may, be, even, more, significant, than, the, increase, in, size, fossilized, skulls, shows, the, brain, size, in, early, humans, fell, within, the, range, of, modern, humans, 300, 000, years, ago, but, only, got, its, present, day, brain, shape, between, 100, 000, and, 35, 000, years, ago, the, temporal, lobes, which, contain, centers, for, language, processing, have, increased, disproportionately, as, has, the, prefrontal, cortex, which, has, been, related, to, complex, decision, making, and, moderating, social, behavior, encephalization, has, been, tied, to, increased, starches, and, meat, in, the, diet, however, a, 2022, meta, study, called, into, question, the, role, of, meat, other, factors, are, the, development, of, cooking, and, it, has, been, proposed, that, intelligence, increased, as, a, response, to, an, increased, necessity, for, solving, social, problems, as, human, society, became, more, complex, changes, in, skull, morphology, such, as, smaller, mandibles, and, mandible, muscle, attachments, allowed, more, room, for, the, brain, to, grow, the, increase, in, volume, of, the, neocortex, also, included, a, rapid, increase, in, size, of, the, cerebellum, its, function, has, traditionally, been, associated, with, balance, and, fine, motor, control, but, more, recently, with, speech, and, cognition, the, great, apes, including, hominids, had, a, more, pronounced, cerebellum, relative, to, the, neocortex, than, other, primates, it, has, been, suggested, that, because, of, its, function, of, sensory, motor, control, and, learning, complex, muscular, actions, the, cerebellum, may, have, underpinned, human, technological, adaptations, including, the, preconditions, of, speech, the, immediate, survival, advantage, of, encephalization, is, difficult, to, discern, as, the, major, brain, changes, from, homo, erectus, to, homo, heidelbergensis, were, not, accompanied, by, major, changes, in, technology, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, changes, were, mainly, social, and, behavioural, including, increased, empathic, abilities, increases, in, size, of, social, groups, and, increased, behavioral, plasticity, humans, are, unique, in, the, ability, to, acquire, information, through, social, transmission, and, adapt, that, information, the, emerging, field, of, cultural, evolution, studies, human, sociocultural, change, from, an, evolutionary, perspective, the, reduced, degree, of, sexual, dimorphism, in, humans, is, visible, primarily, in, the, reduction, of, the, male, canine, tooth, relative, to, other, ape, species, except, gibbons, and, reduced, brow, ridges, and, general, robustness, of, males, another, important, physiological, change, related, to, sexuality, in, humans, was, the, evolution, of, hidden, estrus, humans, are, the, only, hominoids, in, which, the, female, is, fertile, year, round, and, in, which, no, special, signals, of, fertility, are, produced, by, the, body, such, as, genital, swelling, or, overt, changes, in, proceptivity, during, estrus, nonetheless, humans, retain, a, degree, of, sexual, dimorphism, in, the, distribution, of, body, hair, and, subcutaneous, fat, and, in, the, overall, size, males, being, around, 15, larger, than, females, these, changes, taken, together, have, been, interpreted, as, a, result, of, an, increased, emphasis, on, pair, bonding, as, a, possible, solution, to, the, requirement, for, increased, parental, investment, due, to, the, prolonged, infancy, of, offspring, the, ulnar, opposition, the, contact, between, the, thumb, and, the, tip, of, the, little, finger, of, the, same, hand, is, unique, to, the, genus, homo, including, neanderthals, the, sima, de, los, huesos, hominins, and, anatomically, modern, humans, in, other, primates, the, thumb, is, short, and, unable, to, touch, the, little, finger, the, ulnar, opposition, facilitates, the, precision, grip, and, power, grip, of, the, human, hand, underlying, all, the, skilled, manipulations, a, number, of, other, changes, have, also, characterized, the, evolution, of, humans, among, them, an, increased, reliance, on, vision, rather, than, smell, highly, reduced, olfactory, bulb, a, longer, juvenile, developmental, period, and, higher, infant, dependency, a, smaller, gut, and, small, misaligned, teeth, faster, basal, metabolism, loss, of, body, hair, an, increase, in, eccrine, sweat, gland, density, that, is, ten, times, higher, than, any, other, catarrhinian, primates, yet, humans, use, 30, to, 50, less, water, per, day, compared, to, chimps, and, gorillas, more, rem, sleep, but, less, sleep, in, total, a, change, in, the, shape, of, the, dental, arcade, from, u, shaped, to, parabolic, development, of, a, chin, found, in, homo, sapiens, alone, styloid, processes, and, a, descended, larynx, as, the, human, hand, and, arms, adapted, to, the, making, of, tools, and, were, used, less, for, climbing, the, shoulder, blades, changed, too, as, a, side, effect, it, allowed, human, ancestors, to, throw, objects, with, greater, force, speed, and, accuracy, the, use, of, tools, has, been, interpreted, as, a, sign, of, intelligence, and, it, has, been, theorized, that, tool, use, may, have, stimulated, certain, aspects, of, human, evolution, especially, the, continued, expansion, of, the, human, brain, paleontology, has, yet, to, explain, the, expansion, of, this, organ, over, millions, of, years, despite, being, extremely, demanding, in, terms, of, energy, consumption, the, brain, of, a, modern, human, consumes, on, average, about, 13, watts, 260, kilocalories, per, day, a, fifth, of, the, body, s, resting, power, consumption, increased, tool, use, would, allow, hunting, for, energy, rich, meat, products, and, would, enable, processing, more, energy, rich, plant, products, researchers, have, suggested, that, early, hominins, were, thus, under, evolutionary, pressure, to, increase, their, capacity, to, create, and, use, tools, precisely, when, early, humans, started, to, use, tools, is, difficult, to, determine, because, the, more, primitive, these, tools, are, for, example, sharp, edged, stones, the, more, difficult, it, is, to, decide, whether, they, are, natural, objects, or, human, artifacts, there, is, some, evidence, that, the, australopithecines, 4, ma, may, have, used, broken, bones, as, tools, but, this, is, debated, many, species, make, and, use, tools, but, it, is, the, human, genus, that, dominates, the, areas, of, making, and, using, more, complex, tools, the, oldest, known, tools, are, flakes, from, west, turkana, kenya, which, date, to, 3, 3, million, years, ago, the, next, oldest, stone, tools, are, from, gona, ethiopia, and, are, considered, the, beginning, of, the, oldowan, technology, these, tools, date, to, about, 2, 6, million, years, ago, a, homo, fossil, was, found, near, some, oldowan, tools, and, its, age, was, noted, at, 2, 3, million, years, old, suggesting, that, maybe, the, homo, species, did, indeed, create, and, use, these, tools, it, is, a, possibility, but, does, not, yet, represent, solid, evidence, the, third, metacarpal, styloid, process, enables, the, hand, bone, to, lock, into, the, wrist, bones, allowing, for, greater, amounts, of, pressure, to, be, applied, to, the, wrist, and, hand, from, a, grasping, thumb, and, fingers, it, allows, humans, the, dexterity, and, strength, to, make, and, use, complex, tools, this, unique, anatomical, feature, separates, humans, from, apes, and, other, nonhuman, primates, and, is, not, seen, in, human, fossils, older, than, 1, 8, million, years, bernard, wood, noted, that, paranthropus, co, existed, with, the, early, homo, species, in, the, area, of, the, oldowan, industrial, complex, over, roughly, the, same, span, of, time, although, there, is, no, direct, evidence, which, identifies, paranthropus, as, the, tool, makers, their, anatomy, lends, to, indirect, evidence, of, their, capabilities, in, this, area, most, paleoanthropologists, agree, that, the, early, homo, species, were, indeed, responsible, for, most, of, the, oldowan, tools, found, they, argue, that, when, most, of, the, oldowan, tools, were, found, in, association, with, human, fossils, homo, was, always, present, but, paranthropus, was, not, in, 1994, randall, susman, used, the, anatomy, of, opposable, thumbs, as, the, basis, for, his, argument, that, both, the, homo, and, paranthropus, species, were, toolmakers, he, compared, bones, and, muscles, of, human, and, chimpanzee, thumbs, finding, that, humans, have, 3, muscles, which, are, lacking, in, chimpanzees, humans, also, have, thicker, metacarpals, with, broader, heads, allowing, more, precise, grasping, than, the, chimpanzee, hand, can, perform, susman, posited, that, modern, anatomy, of, the, human, opposable, thumb, is, an, evolutionary, response, to, the, requirements, associated, with, making, and, handling, tools, and, that, both, species, were, indeed, toolmakers, anthropologists, describe, modern, human, behavior, to, include, cultural, and, behavioral, traits, such, as, specialization, of, tools, use, of, jewellery, and, images, such, as, cave, drawings, organization, of, living, space, rituals, such, as, grave, gifts, specialized, hunting, techniques, exploration, of, less, hospitable, geographical, areas, and, barter, trade, networks, as, well, as, more, general, traits, such, as, language, and, complex, symbolic, thinking, debate, continues, as, to, whether, a, revolution, led, to, modern, humans, big, bang, of, human, consciousness, or, whether, the, evolution, was, more, gradual, until, about, 50, 000, 40, 000, years, ago, the, use, of, stone, tools, seems, to, have, progressed, stepwise, each, phase, h, habilis, h, ergaster, h, neanderthalensis, marked, a, new, technology, followed, by, very, slow, development, until, the, next, phase, currently, paleoanthropologists, are, debating, whether, these, homo, species, possessed, some, or, many, modern, human, behaviors, they, seem, to, have, been, culturally, conservative, maintaining, the, same, technologies, and, foraging, patterns, over, very, long, periods, around, 50, 000, bp, human, culture, started, to, evolve, more, rapidly, the, transition, to, behavioral, modernity, has, been, characterized, by, some, as, a, great, leap, forward, or, as, the, upper, palaeolithic, revolution, due, to, the, sudden, appearance, in, the, archaeological, record, of, distinctive, signs, of, modern, behavior, and, big, game, hunting, evidence, of, behavioral, modernity, significantly, earlier, also, exists, from, africa, with, older, evidence, of, abstract, imagery, widened, subsistence, strategies, more, sophisticated, tools, and, weapons, and, other, modern, behaviors, and, many, scholars, have, recently, argued, that, the, transition, to, modernity, occurred, sooner, than, previously, believed, other, scholars, consider, the, transition, to, have, been, more, gradual, noting, that, some, features, had, already, appeared, among, archaic, african, homo, sapiens, 300, 000, 200, 000, years, ago, recent, evidence, suggests, that, the, australian, aboriginal, population, separated, from, the, african, population, 75, 000, years, ago, and, that, they, made, a, 160, km, 99, mi, sea, journey, 60, 000, years, ago, which, may, diminish, the, significance, of, the, upper, paleolithic, revolution, modern, humans, started, burying, their, dead, making, clothing, from, animal, hides, hunting, with, more, sophisticated, techniques, such, as, using, pit, traps, or, driving, animals, off, cliffs, and, cave, painting, as, human, culture, advanced, different, populations, innovated, existing, technologies, artifacts, such, as, fish, hooks, buttons, and, bone, needles, show, signs, of, cultural, variation, which, had, not, been, seen, prior, to, 50, 000, bp, typically, the, older, h, neanderthalensis, populations, did, not, vary, in, their, technologies, although, the, chatelperronian, assemblages, have, been, found, to, be, neanderthal, imitations, of, h, sapiens, aurignacian, technologies, anatomically, modern, human, populations, continue, to, evolve, as, they, are, affected, by, both, natural, selection, and, genetic, drift, although, selection, pressure, on, some, traits, such, as, resistance, to, smallpox, has, decreased, in, the, modern, age, humans, are, still, undergoing, natural, selection, for, many, other, traits, some, of, these, are, due, to, specific, environmental, pressures, while, others, are, related, to, lifestyle, changes, since, the, development, of, agriculture, 10, 000, years, ago, urbanization, 5, 000, and, industrialization, 250, years, ago, it, has, been, argued, that, human, evolution, has, accelerated, since, the, development, of, agriculture, 10, 000, years, ago, and, civilization, some, 5, 000, years, ago, resulting, it, is, claimed, in, substantial, genetic, differences, between, different, current, human, populations, and, more, recent, research, indicates, that, for, some, traits, the, developments, and, innovations, of, human, culture, have, driven, a, new, form, of, selection, that, coexists, with, and, in, some, cases, has, largely, replaced, natural, selection, particularly, conspicuous, is, variation, in, superficial, characteristics, such, as, afro, textured, hair, or, the, recent, evolution, of, light, skin, and, blond, hair, in, some, populations, which, are, attributed, to, differences, in, climate, particularly, strong, selective, pressures, have, resulted, in, high, altitude, adaptation, in, humans, with, different, ones, in, different, isolated, populations, studies, of, the, genetic, basis, show, that, some, developed, very, recently, with, tibetans, evolving, over, 3, 000, years, to, have, high, proportions, of, an, allele, of, epas1, that, is, adaptive, to, high, altitudes, other, evolution, is, related, to, endemic, diseases, the, presence, of, malaria, selects, for, sickle, cell, trait, the, heterozygous, form, of, sickle, cell, gene, while, in, the, absence, of, malaria, the, health, effects, of, sickle, cell, anemia, select, against, this, trait, for, another, example, the, population, at, risk, of, the, severe, debilitating, disease, kuru, has, significant, over, representation, of, an, immune, variant, of, the, prion, protein, gene, g127v, versus, non, immune, alleles, the, frequency, of, this, genetic, variant, is, due, to, the, survival, of, immune, persons, some, reported, trends, remain, unexplained, and, the, subject, of, ongoing, research, in, the, novel, field, of, evolutionary, medicine, polycystic, ovary, syndrome, pcos, reduces, fertility, and, thus, is, expected, to, be, subject, to, extremely, strong, negative, selection, but, its, relative, commonality, in, human, populations, suggests, a, counteracting, selection, pressure, the, identity, of, that, pressure, remains, the, subject, of, some, debate, recent, human, evolution, related, to, agriculture, includes, genetic, resistance, to, infectious, disease, that, has, appeared, in, human, populations, by, crossing, the, species, barrier, from, domesticated, animals, as, well, as, changes, in, metabolism, due, to, changes, in, diet, such, as, lactase, persistence, culturally, driven, evolution, can, defy, the, expectations, of, natural, selection, while, human, populations, experience, some, pressure, that, drives, a, selection, for, producing, children, at, younger, ages, the, advent, of, effective, contraception, higher, education, and, changing, social, norms, have, driven, the, observed, selection, in, the, opposite, direction, however, culturally, driven, selection, need, not, necessarily, work, counter, or, in, opposition, to, natural, selection, some, proposals, to, explain, the, high, rate, of, recent, human, brain, expansion, indicate, a, kind, of, feedback, whereupon, the, brain, s, increased, social, learning, efficiency, encourages, cultural, developments, that, in, turn, encourage, more, efficiency, which, drive, more, complex, cultural, developments, that, demand, still, greater, efficiency, and, so, forth, culturally, driven, evolution, has, an, advantage, in, that, in, addition, to, the, genetic, effects, it, can, be, observed, also, in, the, archaeological, record, the, development, of, stone, tools, across, the, palaeolithic, period, connects, to, culturally, driven, cognitive, development, in, the, form, of, skill, acquisition, supported, by, the, culture, and, the, development, of, increasingly, complex, technologies, and, the, cognitive, ability, to, elaborate, them, in, contemporary, times, since, industrialization, some, trends, have, been, observed, for, instance, menopause, is, evolving, to, occur, later, other, reported, trends, appear, to, include, lengthening, of, the, human, reproductive, period, and, reduction, in, cholesterol, levels, blood, glucose, and, blood, pressure, in, some, populations, the, name, homo, of, the, biological, genus, to, which, humans, belong, is, latin, for, human, it, was, chosen, originally, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, classification, system, the, english, word, human, is, from, the, latin, humanus, the, adjectival, form, of, homo, the, latin, homo, derives, from, the, indo, european, root, dhghem, or, earth, linnaeus, and, other, scientists, of, his, time, also, considered, the, great, apes, to, be, the, closest, relatives, of, humans, based, on, morphological, and, anatomical, similarities, the, possibility, of, linking, humans, with, earlier, apes, by, descent, became, clear, only, after, 1859, with, the, publication, of, charles, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, in, which, he, argued, for, the, idea, of, the, evolution, of, new, species, from, earlier, ones, darwin, s, book, did, not, address, the, question, of, human, evolution, saying, only, that, light, will, be, thrown, on, the, origin, of, man, and, his, history, the, first, debates, about, the, nature, of, human, evolution, arose, between, thomas, henry, huxley, and, richard, owen, huxley, argued, for, human, evolution, from, apes, by, illustrating, many, of, the, similarities, and, differences, between, humans, and, other, apes, and, did, so, particularly, in, his, 1863, book, evidence, as, to, man, s, place, in, nature, many, of, darwin, s, early, supporters, such, as, alfred, russel, wallace, and, charles, lyell, did, not, initially, agree, that, the, origin, of, the, mental, capacities, and, the, moral, sensibilities, of, humans, could, be, explained, by, natural, selection, though, this, later, changed, darwin, applied, the, theory, of, evolution, and, sexual, selection, to, humans, in, his, 1871, book, the, descent, of, man, and, selection, in, relation, to, sex, a, major, problem, in, the, 19th, century, was, the, lack, of, fossil, intermediaries, neanderthal, remains, were, discovered, in, a, limestone, quarry, in, 1856, three, years, before, the, publication, of, on, the, origin, of, species, and, neanderthal, fossils, had, been, discovered, in, gibraltar, even, earlier, but, it, was, originally, claimed, that, these, were, the, remains, of, a, modern, human, who, had, suffered, some, kind, of, illness, despite, the, 1891, discovery, by, eug, ne, dubois, of, what, is, now, called, homo, erectus, at, trinil, java, it, was, only, in, the, 1920s, when, such, fossils, were, discovered, in, africa, that, intermediate, species, began, to, accumulate, in, 1925, raymond, dart, described, australopithecus, africanus, the, type, specimen, was, the, taung, child, an, australopithecine, infant, which, was, discovered, in, a, cave, the, child, s, remains, were, a, remarkably, well, preserved, tiny, skull, and, an, endocast, of, the, brain, although, the, brain, was, small, 410, cm, 3, its, shape, was, rounded, unlike, that, of, chimpanzees, and, gorillas, and, more, like, a, modern, human, brain, also, the, specimen, showed, short, canine, teeth, and, the, position, of, the, foramen, magnum, the, hole, in, the, skull, where, the, spine, enters, was, evidence, of, bipedal, locomotion, all, of, these, traits, convinced, dart, that, the, taung, child, was, a, bipedal, human, ancestor, a, transitional, form, between, apes, and, humans, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, hundreds, of, fossils, were, found, in, east, africa, in, the, regions, of, the, olduvai, gorge, and, lake, turkana, these, searches, were, carried, out, by, the, leakey, family, with, louis, leakey, and, his, wife, mary, leakey, and, later, their, son, richard, and, daughter, in, law, meave, fossil, hunters, and, paleoanthropologists, from, the, fossil, beds, of, olduvai, and, lake, turkana, they, amassed, specimens, of, the, early, hominins, the, australopithecines, and, homo, species, and, even, h, erectus, these, finds, cemented, africa, as, the, cradle, of, humankind, in, the, late, 1970s, and, the, 1980s, ethiopia, emerged, as, the, new, hot, spot, of, paleoanthropology, after, lucy, the, most, complete, fossil, member, of, the, species, australopithecus, afarensis, was, found, in, 1974, by, donald, johanson, near, hadar, in, the, desertic, afar, triangle, region, of, northern, ethiopia, although, the, specimen, had, a, small, brain, the, pelvis, and, leg, bones, were, almost, identical, in, function, to, those, of, modern, humans, showing, with, certainty, that, these, hominins, had, walked, erect, lucy, was, classified, as, a, new, species, australopithecus, afarensis, which, is, thought, to, be, more, closely, related, to, the, genus, homo, as, a, direct, ancestor, or, as, a, close, relative, of, an, unknown, ancestor, than, any, other, known, hominid, or, hominin, from, this, early, time, range, the, specimen, was, nicknamed, lucy, after, the, beatles, song, lucy, in, the, sky, with, diamonds, which, was, played, loudly, and, repeatedly, in, the, camp, during, the, excavations, the, afar, triangle, area, would, later, yield, discovery, of, many, more, hominin, fossils, particularly, those, uncovered, or, described, by, teams, headed, by, tim, d, white, in, the, 1990s, including, ardipithecus, ramidus, and, a, kadabba, in, 2013, fossil, skeletons, of, homo, naledi, an, extinct, species, of, hominin, assigned, provisionally, to, the, genus, homo, were, found, in, the, rising, star, cave, system, a, site, in, south, africa, s, cradle, of, humankind, region, in, gauteng, province, near, johannesburg, as, of, september, 2015, fossils, of, at, least, fifteen, individuals, amounting, to, 1, 550, specimens, have, been, excavated, from, the, cave, the, species, is, characterized, by, a, body, mass, and, stature, similar, to, small, bodied, human, populations, a, smaller, endocranial, volume, similar, to, australopithecus, and, a, cranial, morphology, skull, shape, similar, to, early, homo, species, the, skeletal, anatomy, combines, primitive, features, known, from, australopithecines, with, features, known, from, early, hominins, the, individuals, show, signs, of, having, been, deliberately, disposed, of, within, the, cave, near, the, time, of, death, the, fossils, were, dated, close, to, 250, 000, years, ago, and, thus, are, not, ancestral, but, contemporary, with, the, first, appearance, of, larger, brained, anatomically, modern, humans, the, genetic, revolution, in, studies, of, human, evolution, started, when, vincent, sarich, and, allan, wilson, measured, the, strength, of, immunological, cross, reactions, of, blood, serum, albumin, between, pairs, of, creatures, including, humans, and, african, apes, chimpanzees, and, gorillas, the, strength, of, the, reaction, could, be, expressed, numerically, as, an, immunological, distance, which, was, in, turn, proportional, to, the, number, of, amino, acid, differences, between, homologous, proteins, in, different, species, by, constructing, a, calibration, curve, of, the, id, of, species, pairs, with, known, divergence, times, in, the, fossil, record, the, data, could, be, used, as, a, molecular, clock, to, estimate, the, times, of, divergence, of, pairs, with, poorer, or, unknown, fossil, records, in, their, seminal, 1967, paper, in, science, sarich, and, wilson, estimated, the, divergence, time, of, humans, and, apes, as, four, to, five, million, years, ago, at, a, time, when, standard, interpretations, of, the, fossil, record, gave, this, divergence, as, at, least, 10, to, as, much, as, 30, million, years, subsequent, fossil, discoveries, notably, lucy, and, reinterpretation, of, older, fossil, materials, notably, ramapithecus, showed, the, younger, estimates, to, be, correct, and, validated, the, albumin, method, progress, in, dna, sequencing, specifically, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, and, then, y, chromosome, dna, y, dna, advanced, the, understanding, of, human, origins, application, of, the, molecular, clock, principle, revolutionized, the, study, of, molecular, evolution, on, the, basis, of, a, separation, from, the, orangutan, between, 10, and, 20, million, years, ago, earlier, studies, of, the, molecular, clock, suggested, that, there, were, about, 76, mutations, per, generation, that, were, not, inherited, by, human, children, from, their, parents, this, evidence, supported, the, divergence, time, between, hominins, and, chimpanzees, noted, above, however, a, 2012, study, in, iceland, of, 78, children, and, their, parents, suggests, a, mutation, rate, of, only, 36, mutations, per, generation, this, datum, extends, the, separation, between, humans, and, chimpanzees, to, an, earlier, period, greater, than, 7, million, years, ago, ma, additional, research, with, 226, offspring, of, wild, chimpanzee, populations, in, eight, locations, suggests, that, chimpanzees, reproduce, at, age, 26, 5, years, on, average, which, suggests, the, human, divergence, from, chimpanzees, occurred, between, 7, and, 13, mya, and, these, data, suggest, that, ardipithecus, 4, 5, ma, orrorin, 6, ma, and, sahelanthropus, 7, ma, all, may, be, on, the, hominid, lineage, and, even, that, the, separation, may, have, occurred, outside, the, east, african, rift, region, furthermore, analysis, of, the, two, species, genes, in, 2006, provides, evidence, that, after, human, ancestors, had, started, to, diverge, from, chimpanzees, interspecies, mating, between, proto, human, and, proto, chimpanzees, nonetheless, occurred, regularly, enough, to, change, certain, genes, in, the, new, gene, pool, the, research, suggests, in, the, 1990s, several, teams, of, paleoanthropologists, were, working, throughout, africa, looking, for, evidence, of, the, earliest, divergence, of, the, hominin, lineage, from, the, great, apes, in, 1994, meave, leakey, discovered, australopithecus, anamensis, the, find, was, overshadowed, by, tim, d, white, s, 1995, discovery, of, ardipithecus, ramidus, which, pushed, back, the, fossil, record, to, 4, 2, million, years, ago, in, 2000, martin, pickford, and, brigitte, senut, discovered, in, the, tugen, hills, of, kenya, a, 6, million, year, old, bipedal, hominin, which, they, named, orrorin, tugenensis, and, in, 2001, a, team, led, by, michel, brunet, discovered, the, skull, of, sahelanthropus, tchadensis, which, was, dated, as, 7, 2, million, years, ago, and, which, brunet, argued, was, a, bipedal, and, therefore, a, hominid, that, is, a, hominin, cf, hominidae, terms, hominids, and, hominins, anthropologists, in, the, 1980s, were, divided, regarding, some, details, of, reproductive, barriers, and, migratory, dispersals, of, the, genus, homo, subsequently, genetics, has, been, used, to, investigate, and, resolve, these, issues, according, to, the, sahara, pump, theory, evidence, suggests, that, the, genus, homo, have, migrated, out, of, africa, at, least, three, and, possibly, four, times, e, g, homo, erectus, homo, heidelbergensis, and, two, or, three, times, for, homo, sapiens, recent, evidence, suggests, these, dispersals, are, closely, related, to, fluctuating, periods, of, climate, change, recent, evidence, suggests, that, humans, may, have, left, africa, half, a, million, years, earlier, than, previously, thought, a, joint, franco, indian, team, has, found, human, artifacts, in, the, siwalk, hills, north, of, new, delhi, dating, back, at, least, 2, 6, million, years, this, is, earlier, than, the, previous, earliest, finding, of, genus, homo, at, dmanisi, in, georgia, dating, to, 1, 85, million, years, although, controversial, tools, found, at, a, chinese, cave, strengthen, the, case, that, humans, used, tools, as, far, back, as, 2, 48, million, years, ago, this, suggests, that, the, asian, chopper, tool, tradition, found, in, java, and, northern, china, may, have, left, africa, before, the, appearance, of, the, acheulian, hand, axe, up, until, the, genetic, evidence, became, available, there, were, two, dominant, models, for, the, dispersal, of, modern, humans, the, multiregional, hypothesis, proposed, that, the, genus, homo, contained, only, a, single, interconnected, population, as, it, does, today, not, separate, species, and, that, its, evolution, took, place, worldwide, continuously, over, the, last, couple, of, million, years, this, model, was, proposed, in, 1988, by, milford, h, wolpoff, in, contrast, the, out, of, africa, model, proposed, that, modern, h, sapiens, speciated, in, africa, recently, that, is, approximately, 200, 000, years, ago, and, the, subsequent, migration, through, eurasia, resulted, in, the, nearly, complete, replacement, of, other, homo, species, this, model, has, been, developed, by, chris, stringer, and, peter, andrews, sequencing, mtdna, and, y, dna, sampled, from, a, wide, range, of, indigenous, populations, revealed, ancestral, information, relating, to, both, male, and, female, genetic, heritage, and, strengthened, the, out, of, africa, theory, and, weakened, the, views, of, multiregional, evolutionism, aligned, in, genetic, tree, differences, were, interpreted, as, supportive, of, a, recent, single, origin, out, of, africa, has, thus, gained, much, support, from, research, using, female, mitochondrial, dna, and, the, male, y, chromosome, after, analysing, genealogy, trees, constructed, using, 133, types, of, mtdna, researchers, concluded, that, all, were, descended, from, a, female, african, progenitor, dubbed, mitochondrial, eve, out, of, africa, is, also, supported, by, the, fact, that, mitochondrial, genetic, diversity, is, highest, among, african, populations, a, broad, study, of, african, genetic, diversity, headed, by, sarah, tishkoff, found, the, san, people, had, the, greatest, genetic, diversity, among, the, 113, distinct, populations, sampled, making, them, one, of, 14, ancestral, population, clusters, the, research, also, located, a, possible, origin, of, modern, human, migration, in, southwestern, africa, near, the, coastal, border, of, namibia, and, angola, the, fossil, evidence, was, insufficient, for, archaeologist, richard, leakey, to, resolve, the, debate, about, exactly, where, in, africa, modern, humans, first, appeared, studies, of, haplogroups, in, y, chromosomal, dna, and, mitochondrial, dna, have, largely, supported, a, recent, african, origin, all, the, evidence, from, autosomal, dna, also, predominantly, supports, a, recent, african, origin, however, evidence, for, archaic, admixture, in, modern, humans, both, in, africa, and, later, throughout, eurasia, has, recently, been, suggested, by, a, number, of, studies, recent, sequencing, of, neanderthal, and, denisovan, genomes, shows, that, some, admixture, with, these, populations, has, occurred, all, modern, human, groups, outside, africa, have, 1, 4, or, according, to, more, recent, research, about, 1, 5, 2, 6, neanderthal, alleles, in, their, genome, and, some, melanesians, have, an, additional, 4, 6, of, denisovan, alleles, these, new, results, do, not, contradict, the, out, of, africa, model, except, in, its, strictest, interpretation, although, they, make, the, situation, more, complex, after, recovery, from, a, genetic, bottleneck, that, some, researchers, speculate, might, be, linked, to, the, toba, supervolcano, catastrophe, a, fairly, small, group, left, africa, and, interbred, with, neanderthals, probably, in, the, middle, east, on, the, eurasian, steppe, or, even, in, north, africa, before, their, departure, their, still, predominantly, african, descendants, spread, to, populate, the, world, a, fraction, in, turn, interbred, with, denisovans, probably, in, southeastern, asia, before, populating, melanesia, hla, haplotypes, of, neanderthal, and, denisova, origin, have, been, identified, in, modern, eurasian, and, oceanian, populations, the, denisovan, epas1, gene, has, also, been, found, in, tibetan, populations, studies, of, the, human, genome, using, machine, learning, have, identified, additional, genetic, contributions, in, eurasians, from, an, unknown, ancestral, population, potentially, related, to, the, neanderthal, denisovan, lineage, there, are, still, differing, theories, on, whether, there, was, a, single, exodus, from, africa, or, several, a, multiple, dispersal, model, involves, the, southern, dispersal, theory, which, has, gained, support, in, recent, years, from, genetic, linguistic, and, archaeological, evidence, in, this, theory, there, was, a, coastal, dispersal, of, modern, humans, from, the, horn, of, africa, crossing, the, bab, el, mandib, to, yemen, at, a, lower, sea, level, around, 70, 000, years, ago, this, group, helped, to, populate, southeast, asia, and, oceania, explaining, the, discovery, of, early, human, sites, in, these, areas, much, earlier, than, those, in, the, levant, this, group, seems, to, have, been, dependent, upon, marine, resources, for, their, survival, stephen, oppenheimer, has, proposed, a, second, wave, of, humans, may, have, later, dispersed, through, the, persian, gulf, oases, and, the, zagros, mountains, into, the, middle, east, alternatively, it, may, have, come, across, the, sinai, peninsula, into, asia, from, shortly, after, 50, 000, yrs, bp, resulting, in, the, bulk, of, the, human, populations, of, eurasia, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, second, group, possibly, possessed, a, more, sophisticated, big, game, hunting, tool, technology, and, was, less, dependent, on, coastal, food, sources, than, the, original, group, much, of, the, evidence, for, the, first, group, s, expansion, would, have, been, destroyed, by, the, rising, sea, levels, at, the, end, of, each, glacial, maximum, the, multiple, dispersal, model, is, contradicted, by, studies, indicating, that, the, populations, of, eurasia, and, the, populations, of, southeast, asia, and, oceania, are, all, descended, from, the, same, mitochondrial, dna, l3, lineages, which, support, a, single, migration, out, of, africa, that, gave, rise, to, all, non, african, populations, on, the, basis, of, the, early, date, of, badoshan, iranian, aurignacian, oppenheimer, suggests, that, this, second, dispersal, may, have, occurred, with, a, pluvial, period, about, 50, 000, years, before, the, present, with, modern, human, big, game, hunting, cultures, spreading, up, the, zagros, mountains, carrying, modern, human, genomes, from, oman, throughout, the, persian, gulf, northward, into, armenia, and, anatolia, with, a, variant, travelling, south, into, israel, and, to, cyrenicia, recent, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, all, modern, non, african, populations, including, those, of, eurasia, and, oceania, are, descended, from, a, single, wave, that, left, africa, between, 65, 000, and, 50, 000, years, ago, the, evidence, on, which, scientific, accounts, of, human, evolution, are, based, comes, from, many, fields, of, natural, science, the, main, source, of, knowledge, about, the, evolutionary, process, has, traditionally, been, the, fossil, record, but, since, the, development, of, genetics, beginning, in, the, 1970s, dna, analysis, has, come, to, occupy, a, place, of, comparable, importance, the, studies, of, ontogeny, phylogeny, and, especially, evolutionary, developmental, biology, of, both, vertebrates, and, invertebrates, offer, considerable, insight, into, the, evolution, of, all, life, including, how, humans, evolved, the, specific, study, of, the, origin, and, life, of, humans, is, anthropology, particularly, paleoanthropology, which, focuses, on, the, study, of, human, prehistory, the, closest, living, relatives, of, humans, are, bonobos, and, chimpanzees, both, genus, pan, and, gorillas, genus, gorilla, with, the, sequencing, of, both, the, human, and, chimpanzee, genome, as, of, 2012, estimates, of, the, similarity, between, their, dna, sequences, range, between, 95, and, 99, it, is, also, noteworthy, that, mice, share, around, 97, 5, of, their, working, dna, with, humans, by, using, the, technique, called, the, molecular, clock, which, estimates, the, time, required, for, the, number, of, divergent, mutations, to, accumulate, between, two, lineages, the, approximate, date, for, the, split, between, lineages, can, be, calculated, the, gibbons, family, hylobatidae, and, then, the, orangutans, genus, pongo, were, the, first, groups, to, split, from, the, line, leading, to, the, hominins, including, humans, followed, by, gorillas, genus, gorilla, and, ultimately, by, the, chimpanzees, genus, pan, the, splitting, date, between, hominin, and, chimpanzee, lineages, is, placed, by, some, between, 4, to, 8, million, years, ago, that, is, during, the, late, miocene, speciation, however, appears, to, have, been, unusually, drawn, out, initial, divergence, occurred, sometime, between, 7, to, 13, million, years, ago, but, ongoing, hybridization, blurred, the, separation, and, delayed, complete, separation, during, several, millions, of, years, patterson, 2006, dated, the, final, divergence, at, 5, to, 6, million, years, ago, genetic, evidence, has, also, been, employed, to, compare, species, within, the, genus, homo, investigating, gene, flow, between, early, modern, humans, and, neanderthals, and, to, enhance, the, understanding, of, the, early, human, migration, patterns, and, splitting, dates, by, comparing, the, parts, of, the, genome, that, are, not, under, natural, selection, and, which, therefore, accumulate, mutations, at, a, fairly, steady, rate, it, is, possible, to, reconstruct, a, genetic, tree, incorporating, the, entire, human, species, since, the, last, shared, ancestor, each, time, a, certain, mutation, single, nucleotide, polymorphism, appears, in, an, individual, and, is, passed, on, to, his, or, her, descendants, a, haplogroup, is, formed, including, all, of, the, descendants, of, the, individual, who, will, also, carry, that, mutation, by, comparing, mitochondrial, dna, which, is, inherited, only, from, the, mother, geneticists, have, concluded, that, the, last, female, common, ancestor, whose, genetic, marker, is, found, in, all, modern, humans, the, so, called, mitochondrial, eve, must, have, lived, around, 200, 000, years, ago, human, evolutionary, genetics, studies, how, human, genomes, differ, among, individuals, the, evolutionary, past, that, gave, rise, to, them, and, their, current, effects, differences, between, genomes, have, anthropological, medical, and, forensic, implications, and, applications, genetic, data, can, provide, important, insight, into, human, evolution, in, may, 2023, scientists, reported, a, more, complicated, pathway, of, human, evolution, than, previously, understood, according, to, the, studies, humans, evolved, from, different, places, and, times, in, africa, instead, of, from, a, single, location, and, period, of, time, there, is, little, fossil, evidence, for, the, divergence, of, the, gorilla, chimpanzee, and, hominin, lineages, the, earliest, fossils, that, have, been, proposed, as, members, of, the, hominin, lineage, are, sahelanthropus, tchadensis, dating, from, 7, million, years, ago, orrorin, tugenensis, dating, from, 5, 7, million, years, ago, and, ardipithecus, kadabba, dating, to, 5, 6, million, years, ago, each, of, these, have, been, argued, to, be, a, bipedal, ancestor, of, later, hominins, but, in, each, case, the, claims, have, been, contested, it, is, also, possible, that, one, or, more, of, these, species, are, ancestors, of, another, branch, of, african, apes, or, that, they, represent, a, shared, ancestor, between, hominins, and, other, apes, the, question, then, of, the, relationship, between, these, early, fossil, species, and, the, hominin, lineage, is, still, to, be, resolved, from, these, early, species, the, australopithecines, arose, around, 4, million, years, ago, and, diverged, into, robust, also, called, paranthropus, and, gracile, branches, one, of, which, possibly, a, garhi, probably, went, on, to, become, ancestors, of, the, genus, homo, the, australopithecine, species, that, is, best, represented, in, the, fossil, record, is, australopithecus, afarensis, with, more, than, 100, fossil, individuals, represented, found, from, northern, ethiopia, such, as, the, famous, lucy, to, kenya, and, south, africa, fossils, of, robust, australopithecines, such, as, a, robustus, or, alternatively, paranthropus, robustus, and, a, p, boisei, are, particularly, abundant, in, south, africa, at, sites, such, as, kromdraai, and, swartkrans, and, around, lake, turkana, in, kenya, the, earliest, member, of, the, genus, homo, is, homo, habilis, which, evolved, around, 2, 8, million, years, ago, h, habilis, is, the, first, species, for, which, we, have, positive, evidence, of, the, use, of, stone, tools, they, developed, the, oldowan, lithic, technology, named, after, the, olduvai, gorge, in, which, the, first, specimens, were, found, some, scientists, consider, homo, rudolfensis, a, larger, bodied, group, of, fossils, with, similar, morphology, to, the, original, h, habilis, fossils, to, be, a, separate, species, while, others, consider, them, to, be, part, of, h, habilis, simply, representing, intraspecies, variation, or, perhaps, even, sexual, dimorphism, the, brains, of, these, early, hominins, were, about, the, same, size, as, that, of, a, chimpanzee, and, their, main, adaptation, was, bipedalism, as, an, adaptation, to, terrestrial, living, during, the, next, million, years, a, process, of, encephalization, began, and, by, the, arrival, about, 1, 9, million, years, ago, of, h, erectus, in, the, fossil, record, cranial, capacity, had, doubled, h, erectus, were, the, first, of, the, hominins, to, emigrate, from, africa, and, from, 1, 8, to, 1, 3, million, years, ago, this, species, spread, through, africa, asia, and, europe, one, population, of, h, erectus, also, sometimes, classified, as, separate, species, h, ergaster, remained, in, africa, and, evolved, into, h, sapiens, it, is, believed, that, h, erectus, and, h, ergaster, were, the, first, to, use, fire, and, complex, tools, in, eurasia, h, erectus, evolved, into, species, such, as, h, antecessor, h, heidelbergensis, and, h, neanderthalensis, the, earliest, fossils, of, anatomically, modern, humans, are, from, the, middle, paleolithic, about, 300, 200, 000, years, ago, such, as, the, herto, and, omo, remains, of, ethiopia, jebel, irhoud, remains, of, morocco, and, florisbad, remains, of, south, africa, later, fossils, from, the, skhul, cave, in, israel, and, southern, europe, begin, around, 90, 000, years, ago, 0, 09, million, years, ago, as, modern, humans, spread, out, from, africa, they, encountered, other, hominins, such, as, h, neanderthalensis, and, the, denisovans, who, may, have, evolved, from, populations, of, h, erectus, that, had, left, africa, around, 2, million, years, ago, the, nature, of, interaction, between, early, humans, and, these, sister, species, has, been, a, long, standing, source, of, controversy, the, question, being, whether, humans, replaced, these, earlier, species, or, whether, they, were, in, fact, similar, enough, to, interbreed, in, which, case, these, earlier, populations, may, have, contributed, genetic, material, to, modern, humans, this, migration, out, of, africa, is, estimated, to, have, begun, about, 70, 50, 000, years, bp, and, modern, humans, subsequently, spread, globally, replacing, earlier, hominins, either, through, competition, or, hybridization, they, inhabited, eurasia, and, oceania, by, 40, 000, years, bp, and, the, americas, by, at, least, 14, 500, years, bp, the, hypothesis, of, interbreeding, also, known, as, hybridization, admixture, or, hybrid, origin, theory, has, been, discussed, ever, since, the, discovery, of, neanderthal, remains, in, the, 19th, century, the, linear, view, of, human, evolution, began, to, be, abandoned, in, the, 1970s, as, different, species, of, humans, were, discovered, that, made, the, linear, concept, increasingly, unlikely, in, the, 21st, century, with, the, advent, of, molecular, biology, techniques, and, computerization, whole, genome, sequencing, of, neanderthal, and, human, genome, were, performed, confirming, recent, admixture, between, different, human, species, in, 2010, evidence, based, on, molecular, biology, was, published, revealing, unambiguous, examples, of, interbreeding, between, archaic, and, modern, humans, during, the, middle, paleolithic, and, early, upper, paleolithic, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, interbreeding, happened, in, several, independent, events, that, included, neanderthals, and, denisovans, as, well, as, several, unidentified, hominins, today, approximately, 2, of, dna, from, all, non, african, populations, including, europeans, asians, and, oceanians, is, neanderthal, with, traces, of, denisovan, heritage, also, 4, 6, of, modern, melanesian, genetics, are, denisovan, comparisons, of, the, human, genome, to, the, genomes, of, neandertals, denisovans, and, apes, can, help, identify, features, that, set, modern, humans, apart, from, other, hominin, species, in, a, 2016, comparative, genomics, study, a, harvard, medical, school, ucla, research, team, made, a, world, map, on, the, distribution, and, made, some, predictions, about, where, denisovan, and, neanderthal, genes, may, be, impacting, modern, human, biology, for, example, comparative, studies, in, the, mid, 2010s, found, several, traits, related, to, neurological, immunological, developmental, and, metabolic, phenotypes, that, were, developed, by, archaic, humans, to, european, and, asian, environments, and, inherited, to, modern, humans, through, admixture, with, local, hominins, although, the, narratives, of, human, evolution, are, often, contentious, several, discoveries, since, 2010, show, that, human, evolution, should, not, be, seen, as, a, simple, linear, or, branched, progression, but, a, mix, of, related, species, in, fact, genomic, research, has, shown, that, hybridization, between, substantially, diverged, lineages, is, the, rule, not, the, exception, in, human, evolution, furthermore, it, is, argued, that, hybridization, was, an, essential, creative, force, in, the, emergence, of, modern, humans, stone, tools, are, first, attested, around, 2, 6, million, years, ago, when, hominins, in, eastern, africa, used, so, called, core, tools, choppers, made, out, of, round, cores, that, had, been, split, by, simple, strikes, this, marks, the, beginning, of, the, paleolithic, or, old, stone, age, its, end, is, taken, to, be, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, around, 10, 000, years, ago, the, paleolithic, is, subdivided, into, the, lower, paleolithic, early, stone, age, ending, around, 350, 000, 300, 000, years, ago, the, middle, paleolithic, middle, stone, age, until, 50, 000, 30, 000, years, ago, and, the, upper, paleolithic, late, stone, age, 50, 000, 10, 000, years, ago, archaeologists, working, in, the, great, rift, valley, in, kenya, have, discovered, the, oldest, known, stone, tools, in, the, world, dated, to, around, 3, 3, million, years, ago, the, implements, are, some, 700, 000, years, older, than, stone, tools, from, ethiopia, that, previously, held, this, distinction, the, period, from, 700, 000, to, 300, 000, years, ago, is, also, known, as, the, acheulean, when, h, ergaster, or, erectus, made, large, stone, hand, axes, out, of, flint, and, quartzite, at, first, quite, rough, early, acheulian, later, retouched, by, additional, more, subtle, strikes, at, the, sides, of, the, flakes, after, 350, 000, bp, the, more, refined, so, called, levallois, technique, was, developed, a, series, of, consecutive, strikes, by, which, scrapers, slicers, racloirs, needles, and, flattened, needles, were, made, finally, after, about, 50, 000, bp, ever, more, refined, and, specialized, flint, tools, were, made, by, the, neanderthals, and, the, immigrant, cro, magnons, knives, blades, skimmers, bone, tools, were, also, made, by, h, sapiens, in, africa, by, 90, 000, 70, 000, years, ago, and, are, also, known, from, early, h, sapiens, sites, in, eurasia, by, about, 50, 000, years, ago, this, list, is, in, chronological, order, across, the, table, by, genus, some, species, subspecies, names, are, well, established, and, some, are, less, established, especially, in, genus, homo,
