a, concussion, also, known, as, a, mild, traumatic, brain, injury, mtbi, is, a, head, injury, that, temporarily, affects, brain, functioning, symptoms, may, include, loss, of, consciousness, memory, loss, headaches, difficulty, with, thinking, concentration, or, balance, nausea, blurred, vision, dizziness, sleep, disturbances, and, mood, changes, any, of, these, symptoms, may, begin, immediately, or, appear, days, after, the, injury, concussion, should, be, suspected, if, a, person, indirectly, or, directly, hits, their, head, and, experiences, any, of, the, symptoms, of, concussion, symptoms, of, a, concussion, may, be, delayed, by, 1, 2, days, after, the, accident, it, is, not, unusual, for, symptoms, to, last, 2, weeks, in, adults, and, 4, weeks, in, children, fewer, than, 10, of, sports, related, concussions, among, children, are, associated, with, loss, of, consciousness, common, causes, include, motor, vehicle, collisions, falls, sports, injuries, and, bicycle, accidents, risk, factors, include, physical, violence, drinking, alcohol, and, a, prior, history, of, concussion, the, mechanism, of, injury, involves, either, a, direct, blow, to, the, head, or, forces, elsewhere, on, the, body, that, are, transmitted, to, the, head, this, is, believed, to, result, in, neuron, dysfunction, as, there, are, increased, glucose, requirements, but, not, enough, blood, supply, a, thorough, evaluation, by, a, qualified, medical, provider, working, in, their, scope, of, practice, such, as, a, physician, or, nurse, practitioner, is, required, to, rule, out, life, threatening, head, injuries, injuries, to, the, cervical, spine, and, neurological, conditions, and, to, use, information, obtained, from, the, medical, evaluation, to, diagnose, a, concussion, glasgow, coma, scale, score, 13, to, 15, loss, of, consciousness, for, less, than, 30, minutes, and, memory, loss, for, less, than, 24, hours, may, be, used, to, rule, out, moderate, or, severe, traumatic, brain, injuries, diagnostic, imaging, such, as, a, ct, scan, or, an, mri, may, be, required, to, rule, out, severe, head, injuries, routine, imaging, is, not, required, to, diagnose, concussion, prevention, of, concussions, includes, the, use, of, a, helmet, when, bicycling, or, motorbiking, treatment, includes, physical, and, mental, rest, for, 1, 2, days, with, a, gradual, step, wise, return, to, activities, school, and, work, prolonged, periods, of, rest, may, slow, recovery, and, result, in, greater, depression, and, anxiety, paracetamol, acetaminophen, or, nsaids, may, be, recommended, to, help, with, a, headache, prescribed, aerobic, exercise, may, improve, recovery, physiotherapy, may, be, useful, for, persisting, balance, problems, headache, or, whiplash, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, may, be, useful, for, mood, changes, evidence, to, support, the, use, of, hyperbaric, oxygen, therapy, and, chiropractic, therapy, is, lacking, worldwide, concussions, are, estimated, to, affect, more, than, 3, 5, per, 1, 000, people, a, year, concussions, are, classified, as, mild, traumatic, brain, injuries, and, are, the, most, common, type, of, tbis, males, and, young, adults, are, most, commonly, affected, outcomes, are, generally, good, another, concussion, before, the, symptoms, of, a, prior, concussion, have, resolved, is, associated, with, worse, outcomes, repeated, concussions, may, also, increase, the, risk, in, later, life, of, chronic, traumatic, encephalopathy, parkinson, s, disease, and, depression, concussion, symptoms, vary, between, people, and, include, physical, cognitive, and, emotional, symptoms, symptoms, may, appear, immediately, or, be, delayed, by, 1, 2, days, delayed, onset, of, symptoms, may, still, be, serious, and, require, a, medical, assessment, up, to, one, third, of, people, with, concussion, experience, longer, or, persisting, concussion, symptoms, also, known, as, post, concussion, syndrome, or, persisting, symptoms, after, concussion, which, is, defined, as, concussion, symptoms, lasting, for, 4, weeks, or, longer, in, children, and, adolescents, and, symptoms, lasting, for, more, than, 14, days, in, an, adult, the, severity, of, the, initial, symptoms, is, the, strongest, predictor, of, recovery, time, in, adults, headaches, are, the, most, common, mtbi, symptom, others, include, dizziness, vomiting, nausea, lack, of, motor, coordination, difficulty, balancing, or, other, problems, with, movement, or, sensation, visual, symptoms, include, light, sensitivity, seeing, bright, lights, blurred, vision, and, double, vision, tinnitus, or, a, ringing, in, the, ears, is, also, commonly, reported, in, one, in, about, seventy, concussions, concussive, convulsions, occur, but, seizures, that, take, place, during, or, immediately, after, a, concussion, are, not, post, traumatic, seizures, and, unlike, post, traumatic, seizures, are, not, predictive, of, post, traumatic, epilepsy, which, requires, some, form, of, structural, brain, damage, not, just, a, momentary, disruption, in, normal, brain, functioning, concussive, convulsions, are, thought, to, result, from, temporary, loss, or, inhibition, of, motor, function, and, are, not, associated, either, with, epilepsy, or, with, more, serious, structural, damage, they, are, not, associated, with, any, particular, sequelae, and, have, the, same, high, rate, of, favorable, outcomes, as, concussions, without, convulsions, cognitive, symptoms, include, confusion, disorientation, and, difficulty, focusing, attention, loss, of, consciousness, may, occur, but, is, not, necessarily, correlated, with, the, severity, of, the, concussion, if, it, is, brief, post, traumatic, amnesia, in, which, events, following, the, injury, cannot, be, recalled, is, a, hallmark, of, concussions, confusion, may, be, present, immediately, or, may, develop, over, several, minutes, a, person, may, repeat, the, same, questions, be, slow, to, respond, to, questions, or, directions, have, a, vacant, stare, or, have, slurred, or, incoherent, speech, other, concussion, symptoms, include, changes, in, sleeping, patterns, and, difficulty, with, reasoning, concentrating, and, performing, everyday, activities, a, concussion, can, result, in, changes, in, mood, including, crankiness, loss, of, interest, in, favorite, activities, or, items, tearfulness, and, displays, of, emotion, that, are, inappropriate, to, the, situation, common, symptoms, in, concussed, children, include, restlessness, lethargy, and, irritability, the, brain, is, surrounded, by, cerebrospinal, fluid, which, protects, it, from, light, trauma, more, severe, impacts, or, the, forces, associated, with, rapid, acceleration, may, not, be, absorbed, by, this, cushion, concussions, and, other, head, related, injuries, occur, when, external, forces, acting, on, the, head, are, transferred, to, the, brain, such, forces, can, occur, when, the, head, is, struck, by, an, object, or, surface, a, direct, impact, or, when, the, torso, rapidly, changes, position, i, e, from, a, body, check, and, force, is, transmitted, to, the, head, an, indirect, impact, forces, may, cause, linear, rotational, or, angular, movement, of, the, brain, or, a, combination, of, them, in, rotational, movement, the, head, turns, around, its, center, of, gravity, and, in, angular, movement, it, turns, on, an, axis, not, through, its, center, of, gravity, the, amount, of, rotational, force, is, thought, to, be, the, major, component, in, concussion, and, its, severity, as, of, 2007, studies, with, athletes, have, shown, that, the, amount, of, force, and, the, location, of, the, impact, are, not, necessarily, correlated, with, the, severity, of, the, concussion, or, its, symptoms, and, have, called, into, question, the, threshold, for, concussion, previously, thought, to, exist, at, around, 70, 75, g, the, parts, of, the, brain, most, affected, by, rotational, forces, are, the, midbrain, and, diencephalon, it, is, thought, that, the, forces, from, the, injury, disrupt, the, normal, cellular, activities, in, the, reticular, activating, system, located, in, these, areas, and, that, this, disruption, produces, the, loss, of, consciousness, often, seen, in, concussion, other, areas, of, the, brain, that, may, be, affected, include, the, upper, part, of, the, brain, stem, the, fornix, the, corpus, callosum, the, temporal, lobe, and, the, frontal, lobe, angular, accelerations, of, 4600, 5900, or, 7900, rad, s, 2, are, estimated, to, have, 25, 50, or, 80, risk, of, mtbi, respectively, in, both, animals, and, humans, mtbi, can, alter, the, brain, s, physiology, for, hours, to, years, setting, into, motion, a, variety, of, pathological, events, as, one, example, in, animal, models, after, an, initial, increase, in, glucose, metabolism, there, is, a, subsequent, reduced, metabolic, state, which, may, persist, for, up, to, four, weeks, after, injury, though, these, events, are, thought, to, interfere, with, neuronal, and, brain, function, the, metabolic, processes, that, follow, concussion, are, reversible, in, a, large, majority, of, affected, brain, cells, however, a, few, cells, may, die, after, the, injury, included, in, the, cascade, of, events, unleashed, in, the, brain, by, concussion, is, impaired, neurotransmission, loss, of, regulation, of, ions, deregulation, of, energy, use, and, cellular, metabolism, and, a, reduction, in, cerebral, blood, flow, excitatory, neurotransmitters, chemicals, such, as, glutamate, that, serve, to, stimulate, nerve, cells, are, released, in, excessive, amounts, the, resulting, cellular, excitation, causes, neurons, to, fire, excessively, this, creates, an, imbalance, of, ions, such, as, potassium, and, calcium, across, the, cell, membranes, of, neurons, a, process, like, excitotoxicity, at, the, same, time, cerebral, blood, flow, is, relatively, reduced, for, unknown, reasons, though, the, reduction, in, blood, flow, is, not, as, severe, as, it, is, in, ischemia, thus, cells, get, less, glucose, than, they, normally, do, which, causes, an, energy, crisis, concurrently, with, these, processes, the, activity, of, mitochondria, may, be, reduced, which, causes, cells, to, rely, on, anaerobic, metabolism, to, produce, energy, increasing, levels, of, the, byproduct, lactate, for, a, period, of, minutes, to, days, after, a, concussion, the, brain, is, especially, vulnerable, to, changes, in, intracranial, pressure, blood, flow, and, anoxia, according, to, studies, performed, on, animals, which, are, not, always, applicable, to, humans, large, numbers, of, neurons, can, die, during, this, period, in, response, to, slight, normally, innocuous, changes, in, blood, flow, concussion, involves, diffuse, as, opposed, to, focal, brain, injury, meaning, that, the, dysfunction, occurs, over, a, widespread, area, of, the, brain, rather, than, in, a, particular, spot, it, is, thought, to, be, a, milder, type, of, diffuse, axonal, injury, because, axons, may, be, injured, to, a, minor, extent, due, to, stretching, animal, studies, in, which, rodents, were, concussed, have, revealed, lifelong, neuropathological, consequences, such, as, ongoing, axonal, degeneration, and, neuroinflammation, in, subcortical, white, matter, tracts, axonal, damage, has, been, found, in, the, brains, of, concussion, patients, who, died, from, other, causes, but, inadequate, blood, flow, to, the, brain, due, to, other, injuries, may, have, contributed, findings, from, a, study, of, the, brains, of, deceased, nfl, athletes, who, received, concussions, suggest, that, lasting, damage, is, done, by, such, injuries, this, damage, the, severity, of, which, increases, with, the, cumulative, number, of, concussions, sustained, can, lead, to, a, variety, of, other, health, issues, the, debate, over, whether, concussion, is, a, functional, or, structural, phenomenon, is, ongoing, structural, damage, has, been, found, in, the, mildly, traumatically, injured, brains, of, animals, but, it, is, not, clear, whether, these, findings, would, apply, to, humans, such, changes, in, brain, structure, could, be, responsible, for, certain, symptoms, such, as, visual, disturbances, but, other, sets, of, symptoms, especially, those, of, a, psychological, nature, are, more, likely, to, be, caused, by, reversible, pathophysiological, changes, in, cellular, function, that, occur, after, concussion, such, as, alterations, in, neurons, biochemistry, these, reversible, changes, could, also, explain, why, dysfunction, is, frequently, temporary, a, task, force, of, head, injury, experts, called, the, concussion, in, sport, group, met, in, 2001, and, decided, that, concussion, may, result, in, neuropathological, changes, but, the, acute, clinical, symptoms, largely, reflect, a, functional, disturbance, rather, than, structural, injury, using, animal, studies, the, pathology, of, a, concussion, seems, to, start, with, mechanical, shearing, and, stretching, forces, disrupting, the, cell, membrane, of, nerve, cells, through, mechanoporation, this, results, in, potassium, outflow, from, within, the, cell, into, the, extracellular, space, with, the, subsequent, release, of, excitatory, neurotransmitters, including, glutamate, which, leads, to, enhanced, potassium, extrusion, in, turn, resulting, in, sustained, depolarization, impaired, nerve, activity, and, potential, nerve, damage, human, studies, have, failed, to, identify, changes, in, glutamate, concentration, immediately, post, mtbi, though, disruptions, have, been, seen, 3, days, to, 2, weeks, post, injury, in, an, effort, to, restore, ion, balance, the, sodium, potassium, ion, pumps, increase, activity, which, results, in, excessive, atp, adenosine, triphosphate, consumption, and, glucose, utilization, quickly, depleting, glucose, stores, within, the, cells, simultaneously, inefficient, oxidative, metabolism, leads, to, anaerobic, metabolism, of, glucose, and, increased, lactate, accumulation, there, is, a, resultant, local, acidosis, in, the, brain, and, increased, cell, membrane, permeability, leading, to, local, swelling, after, this, increase, in, glucose, metabolism, there, is, a, subsequent, lower, metabolic, state, which, may, persist, for, up, to, 4, weeks, after, injury, a, completely, separate, pathway, involves, a, large, amount, of, calcium, accumulating, in, cells, which, may, impair, oxidative, metabolism, and, begin, further, biochemical, pathways, that, result, in, cell, death, again, both, of, these, main, pathways, have, been, established, from, animal, studies, and, the, extent, to, which, they, apply, to, humans, is, still, somewhat, unclear, head, trauma, recipients, are, initially, assessed, to, exclude, a, more, severe, emergency, such, as, an, intracranial, hemorrhage, or, other, serious, head, or, neck, injuries, this, includes, the, abcs, airway, breathing, circulation, and, stabilization, of, the, cervical, spine, which, is, assumed, to, be, injured, in, any, athlete, who, is, found, to, be, unconscious, after, head, or, neck, injury, indications, that, screening, for, more, serious, injury, is, needed, include, red, flag, symptoms, or, concussion, danger, signs, worsening, headaches, persisting, vomiting, increasing, disorientation, or, a, deteriorating, level, of, consciousness, seizures, and, unequal, pupil, size, those, with, such, symptoms, or, those, who, are, at, higher, risk, of, a, more, serious, brain, injury, require, an, emergency, medical, assessment, brain, imaging, such, as, a, ct, scan, or, mri, may, be, suggested, but, should, be, avoided, unless, there, are, progressive, neurological, symptoms, focal, neurological, findings, or, concern, of, skull, fracture, on, exam, diagnosis, of, concussion, requires, an, assessment, performed, by, a, physician, or, nurse, practitioner, to, rule, out, severe, injuries, to, the, brain, and, cervical, spine, mental, health, conditions, or, other, medical, conditions, diagnosis, is, based, on, physical, and, neurological, examination, findings, duration, of, unconsciousness, usually, less, than, 30, minutes, and, post, traumatic, amnesia, usually, less, than, 24, hours, and, the, glasgow, coma, scale, people, with, mtbi, have, scores, of, 13, to, 15, a, ct, scan, or, mri, is, not, required, to, diagnose, concussion, neuropsychological, tests, such, as, the, scat5, child, scat5, may, be, suggested, measure, cognitive, function, such, tests, may, be, administered, hours, days, or, weeks, after, the, injury, or, at, different, times, to, demonstrate, any, trend, some, athletes, are, also, being, tested, pre, season, pre, season, baseline, testing, to, provide, a, baseline, for, comparison, in, the, event, of, an, injury, though, this, may, not, reduce, risk, or, affect, return, to, play, and, baseline, testing, is, not, required, or, suggested, for, most, children, and, adults, if, the, glasgow, coma, scale, is, less, than, 15, at, two, hours, or, less, than, 14, at, any, time, a, ct, is, recommended, in, addition, a, ct, scan, is, more, likely, to, be, performed, if, observation, after, discharge, is, not, assured, or, intoxication, is, present, there, is, suspected, increased, risk, for, bleeding, age, greater, than, 60, or, less, than, 16, most, concussions, without, complication, cannot, be, detected, with, mri, or, ct, scans, however, changes, have, been, reported, on, mri, and, spect, imaging, in, those, with, concussion, and, normal, ct, scans, and, persisting, concussion, symptoms, may, be, associated, with, abnormalities, visible, on, spect, and, pet, scans, mild, head, injury, may, or, may, not, produce, abnormal, eeg, readings, a, blood, test, known, as, the, brain, trauma, indicator, was, approved, in, the, united, states, in, 2018, and, may, be, able, to, rule, out, the, risk, of, intracranial, bleeding, and, thus, the, need, for, a, ct, scan, for, adults, concussion, may, be, under, diagnosed, because, of, the, lack, of, the, highly, noticeable, signs, and, symptoms, while, athletes, may, minimize, their, injuries, to, remain, in, the, competition, direct, impact, to, the, head, is, not, required, for, a, concussion, diagnosis, as, other, bodily, impacts, with, a, subsequent, force, transmission, to, the, head, are, also, causes, a, retrospective, survey, in, 2005, suggested, that, more, than, 88, of, concussions, are, unrecognized, particularly, many, younger, athletes, struggle, with, identifying, their, concussions, which, often, result, in, the, non, disclosure, of, concussions, and, consequently, under, representing, the, incidence, of, concussions, in, the, context, of, sport, diagnosis, can, be, complex, because, concussion, shares, symptoms, with, other, conditions, for, example, persisting, concussion, symptoms, such, as, cognitive, problems, may, be, misattributed, to, brain, injury, when, in, fact, due, to, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, there, are, no, fluid, biomarkers, i, e, blood, or, urine, tests, that, are, validated, for, diagnosing, concussion, in, children, or, adolescents, no, single, definition, of, concussion, minor, head, injury, or, mild, traumatic, brain, injury, is, universally, accepted, in, 2001, the, expert, concussion, in, sport, group, of, the, first, international, symposium, on, concussion, in, sport, defined, concussion, as, a, complex, pathophysiological, process, affecting, the, brain, induced, by, traumatic, biomechanical, forces, it, was, agreed, that, concussion, typically, involves, temporary, impairment, of, neurological, function, that, heals, by, itself, within, time, and, that, neuroimaging, normally, shows, no, gross, structural, changes, to, the, brain, as, the, result, of, the, condition, however, although, no, structural, brain, damage, occurs, according, to, the, classic, definition, some, researchers, have, included, injuries, in, which, structural, damage, has, occurred, and, the, national, institute, for, health, and, clinical, excellence, definition, includes, physiological, or, physical, disruption, in, the, brain, s, synapses, also, by, definition, concussion, has, historically, involved, a, loss, of, consciousness, however, the, definition, has, evolved, over, time, to, include, a, change, in, consciousness, such, as, amnesia, although, controversy, continues, about, whether, the, definition, should, include, only, those, injuries, in, which, loss, of, consciousness, occurs, this, debate, resurfaces, in, some, of, the, best, known, concussion, grading, scales, in, which, those, episodes, involving, loss, of, consciousness, are, graded, as, being, more, severe, than, those, without, definitions, of, mild, traumatic, brain, injury, mtbi, were, inconsistent, until, the, world, health, organization, s, international, statistical, classification, of, diseases, and, related, health, problems, icd, 10, provided, a, consistent, authoritative, definition, across, specialties, in, 1992, since, then, various, organizations, such, as, the, american, congress, of, rehabilitation, medicine, and, the, american, psychiatric, association, in, its, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, have, defined, mtbi, using, some, combination, of, loss, of, consciousness, post, traumatic, amnesia, and, the, glasgow, coma, scale, concussion, falls, under, the, classification, of, mild, tbi, but, it, is, not, clear, whether, concussion, is, implied, in, mild, brain, injury, or, mild, head, injury, mtbi, and, concussion, are, often, treated, as, synonyms, in, medical, literature, but, other, injuries, such, as, intracranial, hemorrhages, e, g, intra, axial, hematoma, epidural, hematoma, and, subdural, hematoma, are, not, necessarily, precluded, in, mtbi, or, mild, head, injury, as, they, are, in, concussion, mtbi, associated, with, abnormal, neuroimaging, may, be, considered, complicated, mtbi, concussion, can, be, considered, to, imply, a, state, in, which, brain, function, is, temporarily, impaired, and, mtbi, to, imply, a, pathophysiological, state, but, in, practice, few, researchers, and, clinicians, distinguish, between, the, terms, descriptions, of, the, condition, including, the, severity, and, the, area, of, the, brain, affected, are, now, used, more, often, than, concussion, in, clinical, neurology, prevention, of, mtbi, involves, general, measures, such, as, wearing, seat, belts, using, airbags, in, cars, and, protective, equipment, such, as, helmets, for, high, risk, sports, older, people, are, encouraged, to, reduce, fall, risk, by, keeping, floors, free, of, clutter, and, wearing, thin, flat, shoes, with, hard, soles, that, do, not, interfere, with, balance, protective, equipment, such, as, helmets, and, other, headgear, and, policy, changes, such, as, the, banning, of, body, checking, in, youth, hockey, leagues, have, been, found, to, reduce, the, number, and, severity, of, concussions, in, athletes, secondary, prevention, such, as, a, return, to, play, protocol, for, an, athlete, may, reduce, the, risk, of, repeat, concussions, new, head, impact, telemetry, system, technology, is, being, placed, in, helmets, to, study, injury, mechanisms, and, may, generate, knowledge, that, will, potentially, help, reduce, the, risk, of, concussions, among, american, football, players, mouth, guards, have, been, put, forward, as, a, preventative, measure, and, there, is, mixed, evidence, supporting, its, use, in, preventing, concussions, but, rather, has, support, in, preventing, dental, trauma, educational, interventions, such, as, handouts, videos, workshops, and, lectures, can, improve, concussion, knowledge, of, diverse, groups, particularly, youth, athletes, and, coaches, strong, concussion, knowledge, may, be, associated, with, greater, recognition, of, concussion, symptoms, higher, rates, of, concussion, reporting, behaviors, and, reduced, body, checking, related, penalties, and, injuries, thereby, lowering, risk, of, mtbi, due, to, the, incidence, of, concussion, in, sport, younger, athletes, often, do, not, disclose, concussions, and, their, symptoms, common, reasons, for, non, disclosure, include, a, lack, of, awareness, of, the, concussion, the, belief, that, the, concussion, was, not, serious, enough, and, not, wanting, to, leave, the, game, or, team, due, to, their, injury, self, reported, concussion, rates, among, u, 20, and, elite, rugby, union, players, in, ireland, are, 45, 48, indicating, that, many, concussions, go, unreported, changes, to, the, rules, or, enforcing, existing, rules, in, sports, such, as, those, against, head, down, tackling, or, spearing, which, is, associated, with, a, high, injury, rate, may, also, prevent, concussions, adults, and, children, with, a, suspected, concussion, require, a, medical, assessment, with, a, doctor, or, nurse, practitioner, to, confirm, the, diagnosis, of, concussion, and, rule, out, more, serious, head, injuries, after, life, threatening, head, injuries, injuries, to, the, cervical, spine, and, neurological, conditions, are, ruled, out, exclusion, of, neck, or, head, injury, observation, should, be, continued, for, several, hours, if, repeated, vomiting, worsening, headache, dizziness, seizure, activity, excessive, drowsiness, double, vision, slurred, speech, unsteady, walk, or, weakness, or, numbness, in, arms, or, legs, or, signs, of, basilar, skull, fracture, develop, immediate, assessment, in, an, emergency, department, is, needed, observation, to, monitor, for, worsening, condition, is, an, important, part, of, treatment, while, it, is, common, advice, that, someone, who, is, concussed, should, not, be, allowed, to, fall, asleep, in, case, they, go, into, a, coma, for, general, cases, this, is, not, supported, by, current, evidence, people, may, be, released, after, assessment, from, their, primary, care, medical, clinic, hospital, or, emergency, room, to, the, care, of, a, trusted, person, with, instructions, to, return, if, they, display, worsening, symptoms, or, those, that, might, indicate, an, emergent, condition, red, flag, symptoms, such, as, change, in, consciousness, convulsions, severe, headache, extremity, weakness, vomiting, new, bleeding, or, deafness, in, either, or, both, ears, education, about, symptoms, their, management, and, their, normal, time, course, may, lead, to, an, improved, outcome, physical, and, cognitive, rest, is, recommended, for, the, first, 24, 48, hours, following, a, concussion, after, which, injured, persons, should, gradually, start, gentle, low, risk, physical, and, cognitive, activities, that, do, not, make, current, symptoms, worse, or, bring, on, new, symptoms, any, activity, for, which, there, is, a, risk, of, contact, falling, or, bumping, the, head, should, be, avoided, until, the, person, has, clearance, from, a, doctor, or, nurse, practitioner, low, risk, activities, can, be, started, even, while, a, person, has, symptoms, resting, completely, for, longer, than, 24, 48, hours, following, concussion, has, been, shown, to, be, associated, with, longer, recovery, the, resumption, of, low, risk, school, activities, should, begin, as, soon, as, the, student, feels, ready, and, has, completed, an, initial, period, of, cognitive, rest, of, no, more, than, 24, 48, hours, following, the, acute, injury, long, absences, from, school, are, not, suggested, however, the, return, to, school, should, be, gradual, and, step, wise, prolonged, complete, mental, or, physical, rest, beyond, 24, 48, hours, after, the, accident, that, lead, to, the, concussion, may, worsen, outcomes, however, rushing, back, to, full, school, work, load, before, the, person, is, ready, has, also, been, associated, with, longer, lasting, symptoms, and, an, extended, recovery, time, students, with, a, suspected, concussion, are, required, to, see, a, doctor, for, an, initial, medical, assessment, and, for, suggestions, on, recovery, however, medical, clearance, is, not, required, for, a, student, to, return, to, school, since, students, may, appear, normal, continuing, education, of, relevant, school, personnel, may, be, needed, to, ensure, appropriate, accommodations, are, made, such, as, part, days, and, extended, deadlines, accommodations, should, be, based, on, the, monitoring, of, symptoms, that, are, present, during, the, return, to, school, transition, including, headaches, dizziness, vision, problems, memory, loss, difficulty, concentrating, and, abnormal, behavior, students, must, have, completely, resumed, their, school, activities, without, requiring, concussion, related, academic, supports, before, returning, to, full, contact, or, competitive, sports, for, persons, participating, in, athletics, it, is, suggested, that, participants, progress, through, a, series, of, graded, steps, these, steps, include, at, each, step, the, person, should, not, have, worsening, or, new, symptoms, for, at, least, 24, hours, before, progressing, to, the, next, if, symptoms, worsen, or, new, symptoms, begin, athletes, should, drop, back, to, the, previous, level, for, at, least, another, 24, hours, intercollegiate, or, professional, athletes, are, typically, followed, closely, by, team, athletic, trainers, during, this, period, but, others, may, not, have, access, to, this, level, of, health, care, and, may, be, sent, home, with, minimal, monitoring, medications, may, be, prescribed, to, treat, headaches, sleep, problems, and, depression, analgesics, such, as, ibuprofen, can, be, taken, for, headaches, but, paracetamol, acetaminophen, is, preferred, to, minimize, the, risk, of, intracranial, hemorrhage, concussed, individuals, are, advised, not, to, use, alcohol, or, other, drugs, that, have, not, been, approved, by, a, doctor, as, they, can, impede, healing, activation, database, guided, eeg, biofeedback, has, been, shown, to, return, the, memory, abilities, of, the, concussed, individual, to, levels, better, than, the, control, group, about, one, percent, of, people, who, receive, treatment, for, mtbi, need, surgery, for, a, brain, injury, determining, the, ideal, time, for, a, person, to, return, to, work, will, depend, on, personal, factors, and, job, related, factors, including, the, intensity, of, the, job, and, the, risk, of, falling, or, hitting, one, s, head, at, work, during, recovery, after, the, required, initial, recovery, period, of, complete, rest, 24, 48, hours, after, the, concussion, began, gradually, and, safely, returning, to, the, workplace, with, accommodations, and, support, in, place, should, be, prioritized, over, staying, home, and, resting, for, long, periods, of, time, to, promote, physical, recovery, and, reduce, the, risk, of, people, becoming, socially, isolated, the, person, should, work, with, their, employer, to, design, a, step, wise, return, to, work, plan, for, those, with, a, high, risk, job, medical, clearance, may, be, required, before, resuming, an, activity, that, could, lead, to, another, head, injury, students, should, have, completed, the, full, return, to, school, progression, with, no, academic, accommodations, related, to, the, concussion, required, before, starting, to, return, to, part, time, work, the, majority, of, children, and, adults, fully, recover, from, a, concussion, however, some, may, experience, a, prolonged, recovery, there, is, no, single, physical, test, blood, test, or, fluid, biomarkers, or, imaging, test, that, can, be, used, to, determine, when, a, person, has, fully, recovered, from, concussion, a, person, s, recovery, may, be, influenced, by, a, variety, of, factors, that, include, age, at, the, time, of, injury, intellectual, abilities, family, environment, social, support, system, occupational, status, coping, strategies, and, financial, circumstances, factors, such, as, a, previous, head, injury, or, a, coexisting, medical, condition, have, been, found, to, predict, longer, lasting, persisting, concussion, symptoms, other, factors, that, may, lengthen, recovery, time, after, mtbi, include, psychological, problems, such, as, substance, abuse, or, clinical, depression, poor, health, before, the, injury, or, additional, injuries, sustained, during, it, and, life, stress, longer, periods, of, amnesia, or, loss, of, consciousness, immediately, after, the, injury, may, indicate, longer, recovery, times, from, residual, symptoms, other, strong, factors, include, participation, in, a, contact, sport, and, body, mass, size, most, children, recover, completely, from, concussion, in, less, than, four, weeks, however, 15, 30, of, youth, may, experience, symptoms, that, last, longer, than, a, month, mild, traumatic, brain, injury, recovery, time, in, people, over, age, 65, may, have, increased, complications, due, to, elevated, health, concerns, or, comorbidities, this, often, results, in, longer, hospitalization, duration, poorer, cognitive, outcomes, and, higher, mortality, rates, for, unknown, reasons, having, had, one, concussion, significantly, increases, a, person, s, risk, of, having, another, having, previously, sustained, a, sports, concussion, has, been, found, to, be, a, strong, factor, increasing, the, likelihood, of, a, concussion, in, the, future, people, who, have, had, a, concussion, seem, more, susceptible, to, another, one, particularly, if, the, new, injury, occurs, before, symptoms, from, the, previous, concussion, have, completely, gone, away, it, is, also, a, negative, process, if, smaller, impacts, cause, the, same, symptom, severity, repeated, concussions, may, increase, a, person, s, risk, in, later, life, for, dementia, parkinson, s, disease, and, depression, in, post, concussion, syndrome, symptoms, do, not, resolve, for, weeks, months, or, years, after, a, concussion, and, may, occasionally, be, permanent, about, 10, to, 20, of, people, have, persisting, concussion, symptoms, for, more, than, a, month, symptoms, may, include, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety, memory, and, attention, problems, sleep, problems, and, irritability, rest, a, previously, recommended, recovery, technique, has, limited, effectiveness, a, recommended, treatment, in, both, children, and, adults, with, symptoms, beyond, 4, weeks, involves, an, active, rehabilitation, program, with, reintroduction, of, non, contact, aerobic, activity, progressive, physical, exercise, has, been, shown, to, reduce, long, term, post, concussive, symptoms, symptoms, usually, go, away, on, their, own, within, months, but, may, last, for, years, the, question, of, whether, the, syndrome, is, due, to, structural, damage, or, other, factors, such, as, psychological, ones, or, a, combination, of, these, has, long, been, the, subject, of, debate, as, of, 1999, cumulative, effects, of, concussions, were, poorly, understood, especially, the, effects, on, children, the, severity, of, concussions, and, their, symptoms, may, worsen, with, successive, injuries, even, if, a, subsequent, injury, occurs, months, or, years, after, an, initial, one, symptoms, may, be, more, severe, and, changes, in, neurophysiology, can, occur, with, the, third, and, subsequent, concussions, as, of, 2006, studies, had, conflicting, findings, on, whether, athletes, have, longer, recovery, times, after, repeat, concussions, and, whether, cumulative, effects, such, as, impairment, in, cognition, and, memory, occur, cumulative, effects, may, include, chronic, traumatic, encephalopathy, psychiatric, disorders, and, loss, of, long, term, memory, for, example, the, risk, of, developing, clinical, depression, has, been, found, to, be, significantly, greater, for, retired, american, football, players, with, a, history, of, three, or, more, concussions, than, for, those, with, no, concussion, history, an, experience, of, three, or, more, concussions, is, associated, with, a, fivefold, greater, chance, of, developing, alzheimer, s, disease, earlier, and, a, threefold, greater, chance, of, developing, memory, deficits, chronic, traumatic, encephalopathy, or, cte, is, an, example, of, the, cumulative, damage, that, can, occur, as, the, result, of, multiple, concussions, or, less, severe, blows, to, the, head, the, condition, was, previously, referred, to, as, dementia, pugilistica, or, punch, drunk, syndrome, as, it, was, first, noted, in, boxers, the, disease, can, lead, to, cognitive, and, physical, disabilities, such, as, parkinsonism, speech, and, memory, problems, slowed, mental, processing, tremor, depression, and, inappropriate, behavior, it, shares, features, with, alzheimer, s, disease, second, impact, syndrome, in, which, the, brain, swells, dangerously, after, a, minor, blow, may, occur, in, very, rare, cases, the, condition, may, develop, in, people, who, receive, a, second, blow, days, or, weeks, after, an, initial, concussion, before, its, symptoms, have, gone, away, no, one, is, certain, of, the, cause, of, this, often, fatal, complication, but, it, is, commonly, thought, that, the, swelling, occurs, because, the, brain, s, arterioles, lose, the, ability, to, regulate, their, diameter, causing, a, loss, of, control, over, cerebral, blood, flow, as, the, brain, swells, intracranial, pressure, rapidly, rises, the, brain, can, herniate, and, the, brain, stem, can, fail, within, five, minutes, except, in, boxing, all, cases, have, occurred, in, athletes, under, age, 20, due, to, the, very, small, number, of, documented, cases, the, diagnosis, is, controversial, and, doubt, exists, about, its, validity, a, 2010, pediatrics, review, article, stated, that, there, is, debate, whether, the, brain, swelling, is, due, to, two, separate, hits, or, to, just, one, hit, but, in, either, case, catastrophic, football, head, injuries, are, three, times, more, likely, in, high, school, athletes, than, in, college, athletes, most, cases, of, traumatic, brain, injury, are, concussions, a, world, health, organization, who, study, estimated, that, between, 70, and, 90, of, head, injuries, that, receive, treatment, are, mild, however, due, to, under, reporting, and, to, the, widely, varying, definitions, of, concussion, and, mtbi, it, is, difficult, to, estimate, how, common, the, condition, is, estimates, of, the, incidence, of, concussion, may, be, artificially, low, for, example, due, to, under, reporting, at, least, 25, of, people, with, mtbi, fail, to, get, assessed, by, a, medical, professional, the, who, group, reviewed, studies, on, the, epidemiology, of, mtbi, and, found, a, hospital, treatment, rate, of, 1, 3, per, 1000, people, but, since, not, all, concussions, are, treated, in, hospitals, they, estimated, that, the, rate, per, year, in, the, general, population, is, over, 6, per, 1000, people, young, children, have, the, highest, concussion, rate, among, all, age, groups, however, most, people, with, a, concussion, are, young, adults, a, canadian, study, found, that, the, yearly, incidence, of, mtbi, is, lower, in, older, age, groups, graph, at, right, studies, suggest, males, develop, mtbi, at, about, twice, the, rate, of, their, female, counterparts, however, female, athletes, may, be, at, a, higher, risk, of, sustaining, a, concussion, than, their, male, counterparts, up, to, five, percent, of, sports, injuries, are, concussions, the, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, estimates, that, 300, 000, sports, related, concussions, occur, yearly, in, the, u, s, but, that, number, includes, only, athletes, who, lost, consciousness, since, loss, of, consciousness, is, thought, to, occur, in, less, than, 10, of, concussions, the, cdc, estimate, is, likely, lower, than, the, real, number, sports, in, which, concussion, is, particularly, common, include, american, football, the, rugby, codes, mma, and, boxing, a, boxer, aims, to, knock, out, i, e, give, a, mild, traumatic, brain, injury, to, the, opponent, the, injury, is, so, common, in, the, latter, that, several, medical, groups, have, called, for, a, ban, on, the, sport, including, the, american, academy, of, neurology, the, world, medical, association, and, the, medical, associations, of, the, uk, the, us, australia, and, canada, concussions, may, also, be, common, and, occur, in, the, workplace, according, to, the, us, bureau, of, labour, statistics, the, most, common, causes, of, mtbi, related, hospitalizations, and, deaths, from, the, workplace, are, falls, force, of, heavy, objects, and, vehicular, collisions, as, a, consequence, jobs, in, the, construction, transportation, and, natural, resource, industries, e, g, agriculture, fishing, mining, have, more, elevated, mtbi, incidence, rates, ranging, from, 10, to, 20, cases, per, 100, 000, workers, in, particular, as, vehicular, collisions, are, the, leading, cause, of, workplace, mtbi, related, injuries, workers, from, the, transportation, sector, often, carry, the, most, risk, despite, these, findings, there, still, remain, important, gaps, in, data, compilation, on, workplace, related, mtbis, which, has, raised, questions, about, increased, concussion, surveillance, and, preventive, measures, in, private, industry, the, hippocratic, corpus, a, collection, of, medical, works, from, ancient, greece, mentions, concussion, later, translated, to, commotio, cerebri, and, discusses, loss, of, speech, hearing, and, sight, that, can, result, from, commotion, of, the, brain, this, idea, of, disruption, of, mental, function, by, shaking, of, the, brain, remained, the, widely, accepted, understanding, of, concussion, until, the, 19th, century, in, the, 10th, century, the, persian, physician, muhammad, ibn, zakar, ya, r, zi, was, the, first, to, write, about, concussion, as, distinct, from, other, types, of, head, injury, he, may, have, been, the, first, to, use, the, term, cerebral, concussion, and, his, definition, of, the, condition, a, transient, loss, of, function, with, no, physical, damage, set, the, stage, for, the, medical, understanding, of, the, condition, for, centuries, in, the, 13th, century, the, physician, lanfranc, of, milan, s, chiurgia, magna, described, concussion, as, brain, commotion, also, recognizing, a, difference, between, concussion, and, other, types, of, traumatic, brain, injury, though, many, of, his, contemporaries, did, not, and, discussing, the, transience, of, post, concussion, symptoms, as, a, result, of, temporary, loss, of, function, from, the, injury, in, the, 14th, century, the, surgeon, guy, de, chauliac, pointed, out, the, relatively, good, prognosis, of, concussion, as, compared, to, more, severe, types, of, head, trauma, such, as, skull, fractures, and, penetrating, head, trauma, in, the, 16th, century, the, term, concussion, came, into, use, and, symptoms, such, as, confusion, lethargy, and, memory, problems, were, described, the, 16th, century, physician, ambroise, par, used, the, term, commotio, cerebri, as, well, as, shaking, of, the, brain, commotion, and, concussion, until, the, 17th, century, a, concussion, was, usually, described, by, its, clinical, features, but, after, the, invention, of, the, microscope, more, physicians, began, exploring, underlying, physical, and, structural, mechanisms, however, the, prevailing, view, in, the, 17th, century, was, that, the, injury, did, not, result, from, physical, damage, and, this, view, continued, to, be, widely, held, throughout, the, 18th, century, the, word, concussion, was, used, at, the, time, to, describe, the, state, of, unconsciousness, and, other, functional, problems, that, resulted, from, the, impact, rather, than, a, physiological, condition, in, 1839, guillaume, dupuytren, described, brain, contusions, which, involve, many, small, hemorrhages, as, contusio, cerebri, and, showed, the, difference, between, unconsciousness, associated, with, damage, to, the, brain, parenchyma, and, that, due, to, concussion, without, such, injury, in, 1941, animal, experiments, showed, that, no, macroscopic, damage, occurs, in, concussion, due, to, the, lack, of, a, consistent, definition, the, economic, costs, of, mtbi, are, not, known, but, they, are, estimated, to, be, very, high, these, high, costs, are, due, in, part, to, the, large, percentage, of, hospital, admissions, for, head, injury, that, is, due, to, mild, head, trauma, but, indirect, costs, such, as, lost, work, time, and, early, retirement, account, for, the, bulk, of, the, costs, these, direct, and, indirect, costs, cause, the, expense, of, mild, brain, trauma, to, rival, that, of, moderate, and, severe, head, injuries, the, terms, mild, brain, injury, mild, traumatic, brain, injury, mtbi, mild, head, injury, mhi, and, concussion, may, be, used, interchangeably, although, the, term, concussion, is, still, used, in, sports, literature, as, interchangeable, with, mhi, or, mtbi, the, general, clinical, medical, literature, uses, mtbi, instead, since, a, 2003, cdc, report, outlined, it, as, an, important, strategy, in, this, article, concussion, and, mtbi, are, used, interchangeably, the, term, concussion, is, from, latin, concutere, to, shake, violently, or, concussus, action, of, striking, together, minocycline, lithium, and, n, acetylcysteine, show, tentative, success, in, animal, models, measurement, of, predictive, visual, tracking, is, being, studied, as, a, screening, technique, to, identify, mild, traumatic, brain, injury, a, head, mounted, display, unit, with, eye, tracking, capability, shows, a, moving, object, in, a, predictive, pattern, for, the, person, to, follow, with, their, eyes, people, without, brain, injury, will, be, able, to, track, the, moving, object, with, smooth, pursuit, eye, movements, and, correct, trajectory, while, it, is, hypothesized, that, those, with, mild, traumatic, brain, injury, cannot, national, and, international, clinical, practice, guidelines, do, not, recommend, a, concussion, grading, system, for, use, by, medical, professionals, in, the, past, the, decision, to, allow, athletes, to, return, to, participation, was, frequently, based, on, the, grade, of, concussion, however, current, research, and, recommendations, by, professional, organizations, including, the, national, athletic, trainers, association, recommend, against, such, use, of, these, grading, systems, currently, injured, athletes, are, prohibited, from, returning, to, play, before, they, are, symptom, free, during, both, rest, and, exertion, and, until, results, of, the, neuropsychological, tests, have, returned, to, pre, injury, levels, three, grading, systems, have, been, most, widely, followed, by, robert, cantu, the, colorado, medical, society, and, the, american, academy, of, neurology, each, employs, three, grades, as, summarized, in, the, following, table, at, least, 41, systems, measure, the, severity, or, grade, of, a, mild, head, injury, and, there, is, little, agreement, about, which, is, best, in, an, effort, to, simplify, the, 2nd, international, conference, on, concussion, in, sport, meeting, in, prague, in, 2004, decided, that, these, systems, should, be, abandoned, in, favor, of, a, simple, or, complex, classification, however, the, 2008, meeting, in, zurich, abandoned, the, simple, versus, complex, terminology, although, the, participants, did, agree, to, keep, the, concept, that, most, 80, 90, concussions, resolve, in, a, short, period, 7, 10, days, and, although, the,
