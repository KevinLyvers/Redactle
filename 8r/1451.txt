colorectal, cancer, crc, also, known, as, bowel, cancer, colon, cancer, or, rectal, cancer, is, the, development, of, cancer, from, the, colon, or, rectum, parts, of, the, large, intestine, signs, and, symptoms, may, include, blood, in, the, stool, a, change, in, bowel, movements, weight, loss, abdominal, pain, and, fatigue, most, colorectal, cancers, are, due, to, lifestyle, factors, and, genetic, disorders, risk, factors, include, diet, obesity, smoking, and, lack, of, physical, activity, dietary, factors, that, increase, the, risk, include, red, meat, processed, meat, and, alcohol, another, risk, factor, is, inflammatory, bowel, disease, which, includes, crohn, s, disease, and, ulcerative, colitis, some, of, the, inherited, genetic, disorders, that, can, cause, colorectal, cancer, include, familial, adenomatous, polyposis, and, hereditary, non, polyposis, colon, cancer, however, these, represent, less, than, 5, of, cases, it, typically, starts, as, a, benign, tumor, often, in, the, form, of, a, polyp, which, over, time, becomes, cancerous, colorectal, cancer, may, be, diagnosed, by, obtaining, a, sample, of, the, colon, during, a, sigmoidoscopy, or, colonoscopy, this, is, then, followed, by, medical, imaging, to, determine, whether, the, disease, has, spread, screening, is, effective, for, preventing, and, decreasing, deaths, from, colorectal, cancer, screening, by, one, of, a, number, of, methods, is, recommended, starting, from, the, age, of, 45, to, 75, it, was, recommended, starting, at, age, 50, but, it, was, changed, to, 45, due, to, increasing, amount, of, colon, cancers, during, colonoscopy, small, polyps, may, be, removed, if, found, if, a, large, polyp, or, tumor, is, found, a, biopsy, may, be, performed, to, check, if, it, is, cancerous, aspirin, and, other, non, steroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, decrease, the, risk, of, pain, during, polyp, excision, their, general, use, is, not, recommended, for, this, purpose, however, due, to, side, effects, treatments, used, for, colorectal, cancer, may, include, some, combination, of, surgery, radiation, therapy, chemotherapy, and, targeted, therapy, cancers, that, are, confined, within, the, wall, of, the, colon, may, be, curable, with, surgery, while, cancer, that, has, spread, widely, is, usually, not, curable, with, management, being, directed, towards, improving, quality, of, life, and, symptoms, the, five, year, survival, rate, in, the, united, states, was, around, 65, in, 2014, the, individual, likelihood, of, survival, depends, on, how, advanced, the, cancer, is, whether, or, not, all, the, cancer, can, be, removed, with, surgery, and, the, person, s, overall, health, globally, colorectal, cancer, is, the, third, most, common, type, of, cancer, making, up, about, 10, of, all, cases, in, 2018, there, were, 1, 09, million, new, cases, and, 551, 000, deaths, from, the, disease, it, is, more, common, in, developed, countries, where, more, than, 65, of, cases, are, found, it, is, less, common, in, women, than, men, the, signs, and, symptoms, of, colorectal, cancer, depend, on, the, location, of, the, tumor, in, the, bowel, and, whether, it, has, spread, elsewhere, in, the, body, metastasis, the, classic, warning, signs, include, worsening, constipation, blood, in, the, stool, decrease, in, stool, caliber, thickness, loss, of, appetite, loss, of, weight, and, nausea, or, vomiting, in, someone, over, 50, years, old, around, 50, of, people, who, have, colorectal, cancer, do, not, report, any, symptoms, rectal, bleeding, or, anemia, are, high, risk, symptoms, in, people, over, the, age, of, 50, weight, loss, and, changes, in, a, person, s, bowel, habit, are, typically, only, concerning, if, they, are, associated, with, rectal, bleeding, 75, 95, of, colorectal, cancer, cases, occur, in, people, with, little, or, no, genetic, risk, risk, factors, include, older, age, male, sex, high, intake, of, fat, sugar, alcohol, red, meat, processed, meats, obesity, smoking, and, a, lack, of, physical, exercise, the, rectal, cancer, survival, calculator, developed, by, the, md, anderson, cancer, center, additionally, considers, race, to, be, a, risk, factor, however, there, are, equity, issues, concerning, whether, this, might, lead, to, inequity, in, clinical, decision, making, approximately, 10, of, cases, are, linked, to, insufficient, activity, the, risk, from, alcohol, appears, to, increase, at, greater, than, one, drink, per, day, drinking, five, glasses, of, water, a, day, is, linked, to, a, decrease, in, the, risk, of, colorectal, cancer, and, adenomatous, polyps, streptococcus, gallolyticus, is, associated, with, colorectal, cancer, some, strains, of, streptococcus, bovis, streptococcus, equinus, complex, are, consumed, by, millions, of, people, daily, and, thus, may, be, safe, 25, to, 80, of, people, with, streptococcus, bovis, gallolyticus, bacteremia, have, concomitant, colorectal, tumors, seroprevalence, of, streptococcus, bovis, gallolyticus, is, considered, as, a, candidate, practical, marker, for, the, early, prediction, of, an, underlying, bowel, lesion, at, high, risk, population, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, presence, of, antibodies, to, streptococcus, bovis, gallolyticus, antigens, or, the, antigens, themselves, in, the, bloodstream, may, act, as, markers, for, the, carcinogenesis, in, the, colon, pathogenic, escherichia, coli, may, increase, the, risk, of, colorectal, cancer, by, producing, the, genotoxic, metabolite, colibactin, people, with, inflammatory, bowel, disease, ulcerative, colitis, and, crohn, s, disease, are, at, increased, risk, of, colon, cancer, the, risk, increases, the, longer, a, person, has, the, disease, and, the, worse, the, severity, of, inflammation, in, these, high, risk, groups, both, prevention, with, aspirin, and, regular, colonoscopies, are, recommended, endoscopic, surveillance, in, this, high, risk, population, may, reduce, the, development, of, colorectal, cancer, through, early, diagnosis, and, may, also, reduce, the, chances, of, dying, from, colon, cancer, people, with, inflammatory, bowel, disease, account, for, less, than, 2, of, colon, cancer, cases, yearly, in, those, with, crohn, s, disease, 2, get, colorectal, cancer, after, 10, years, 8, after, 20, years, and, 18, after, 30, years, in, people, who, have, ulcerative, colitis, approximately, 16, develop, either, a, cancer, precursor, or, cancer, of, the, colon, over, 30, years, those, with, a, family, history, in, two, or, more, first, degree, relatives, such, as, a, parent, or, sibling, have, a, two, to, threefold, greater, risk, of, disease, and, this, group, accounts, for, about, 20, of, all, cases, a, number, of, genetic, syndromes, are, also, associated, with, higher, rates, of, colorectal, cancer, the, most, common, of, these, is, hereditary, nonpolyposis, colorectal, cancer, hnpcc, or, lynch, syndrome, which, is, present, in, about, 3, of, people, with, colorectal, cancer, other, syndromes, that, are, strongly, associated, with, colorectal, cancer, include, gardner, syndrome, and, familial, adenomatous, polyposis, fap, for, people, with, these, syndromes, cancer, almost, always, occurs, and, makes, up, 1, of, the, cancer, cases, a, total, proctocolectomy, may, be, recommended, for, people, with, fap, as, a, preventive, measure, due, to, the, high, risk, of, malignancy, colectomy, removal, of, the, colon, may, not, suffice, as, a, preventive, measure, because, of, the, high, risk, of, rectal, cancer, if, the, rectum, remains, the, most, common, polyposis, syndrome, affecting, the, colon, is, serrated, polyposis, syndrome, which, is, associated, with, a, 25, 40, risk, of, crc, mutations, in, the, pair, of, genes, pole, and, pold1, have, been, associated, with, familial, colon, cancer, most, deaths, due, to, colon, cancer, are, associated, with, metastatic, disease, a, gene, that, appears, to, contribute, to, the, potential, for, metastatic, disease, metastasis, associated, in, colon, cancer, 1, macc1, has, been, isolated, it, is, a, transcriptional, factor, that, influences, the, expression, of, hepatocyte, growth, factor, this, gene, is, associated, with, the, proliferation, invasion, and, scattering, of, colon, cancer, cells, in, cell, culture, and, tumor, growth, and, metastasis, in, mice, macc1, may, be, a, potential, target, for, cancer, intervention, but, this, possibility, needs, to, be, confirmed, with, clinical, studies, epigenetic, factors, such, as, abnormal, dna, methylation, of, tumor, suppressor, promoters, play, a, role, in, the, development, of, colorectal, cancer, ashkenazi, jews, have, a, 6, higher, risk, rate, of, getting, adenomas, and, then, colon, cancer, due, to, mutations, in, the, apc, gene, being, more, common, colorectal, cancer, is, a, disease, originating, from, the, epithelial, cells, lining, the, colon, or, rectum, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, most, frequently, as, a, result, of, genetic, mutations, in, the, wnt, signaling, pathway, that, increases, signaling, activity, the, wnt, signaling, pathway, normally, plays, an, important, role, for, normal, function, of, these, cells, including, maintaining, this, lining, mutations, can, be, inherited, or, acquired, and, most, probably, occur, in, the, intestinal, crypt, stem, cell, the, most, commonly, mutated, gene, in, all, colorectal, cancer, is, the, apc, gene, which, produces, the, apc, protein, the, apc, protein, prevents, the, accumulation, of, catenin, protein, without, apc, catenin, accumulates, to, high, levels, and, translocates, moves, into, the, nucleus, binds, to, dna, and, activates, the, transcription, of, proto, oncogenes, these, genes, are, normally, important, for, stem, cell, renewal, and, differentiation, but, when, inappropriately, expressed, at, high, levels, they, can, cause, cancer, while, apc, is, mutated, in, most, colon, cancers, some, cancers, have, increased, catenin, because, of, mutations, in, catenin, ctnnb1, that, block, its, own, breakdown, or, have, mutations, in, other, genes, with, function, similar, to, apc, such, as, axin1, axin2, tcf7l2, or, nkd1, beyond, the, defects, in, the, wnt, signaling, pathway, other, mutations, must, occur, for, the, cell, to, become, cancerous, the, p53, protein, produced, by, the, tp53, gene, normally, monitors, cell, division, and, induces, their, programmed, death, if, they, have, wnt, pathway, defects, eventually, a, cell, line, acquires, a, mutation, in, the, tp53, gene, and, transforms, the, tissue, from, a, benign, epithelial, tumor, into, an, invasive, epithelial, cell, cancer, sometimes, the, gene, encoding, p53, is, not, mutated, but, another, protective, protein, named, bax, is, mutated, instead, other, proteins, responsible, for, programmed, cell, death, that, are, commonly, deactivated, in, colorectal, cancers, are, tgf, and, dcc, deleted, in, colorectal, cancer, tgf, has, a, deactivating, mutation, in, at, least, half, of, colorectal, cancers, sometimes, tgf, is, not, deactivated, but, a, downstream, protein, named, smad, is, deactivated, dcc, commonly, has, a, deleted, segment, of, a, chromosome, in, colorectal, cancer, approximately, 70, of, all, human, genes, are, expressed, in, colorectal, cancer, with, just, over, 1, of, having, increased, expression, in, colorectal, cancer, compared, to, other, forms, of, cancer, some, genes, are, oncogenes, they, are, overexpressed, in, colorectal, cancer, for, example, genes, encoding, the, proteins, kras, raf, and, pi3k, which, normally, stimulate, the, cell, to, divide, in, response, to, growth, factors, can, acquire, mutations, that, result, in, over, activation, of, cell, proliferation, the, chronological, order, of, mutations, is, sometimes, important, if, a, previous, apc, mutation, occurred, a, primary, kras, mutation, often, progresses, to, cancer, rather, than, a, self, limiting, hyperplastic, or, borderline, lesion, pten, a, tumor, suppressor, normally, inhibits, pi3k, but, can, sometimes, become, mutated, and, deactivated, comprehensive, genome, scale, analysis, has, revealed, that, colorectal, carcinomas, can, be, categorized, into, hypermutated, and, non, hypermutated, tumor, types, in, addition, to, the, oncogenic, and, inactivating, mutations, described, for, the, genes, above, non, hypermutated, samples, also, contain, mutated, ctnnb1, fam123b, sox9, atm, and, arid1a, progressing, through, a, distinct, set, of, genetic, events, hypermutated, tumors, display, mutated, forms, of, acvr2a, tgfbr2, msh3, msh6, slc9a9, tcf7l2, and, braf, the, common, theme, among, these, genes, across, both, tumor, types, is, their, involvement, in, wnt, and, tgf, signaling, pathways, which, results, in, increased, activity, of, myc, a, central, player, in, colorectal, cancer, mismatch, repair, mmr, deficient, tumours, are, characterized, by, a, relatively, high, amount, of, poly, nucleotide, tandem, repeats, this, is, caused, by, a, deficiency, in, mmr, proteins, which, are, typically, caused, by, epigenetic, silencing, and, or, inherited, mutations, e, g, lynch, syndrome, 15, to, 18, percent, of, colorectal, cancer, tumours, have, mmr, deficiencies, with, 3, percent, developing, due, to, lynch, syndrome, the, role, of, the, mismatch, repair, system, is, to, protect, the, integrity, of, the, genetic, material, within, cells, i, e, error, detecting, and, correcting, consequently, a, deficiency, in, mmr, proteins, may, lead, to, an, inability, to, detect, and, repair, genetic, damage, allowing, for, further, cancer, causing, mutations, to, occur, and, colorectal, cancer, to, progress, the, polyp, to, cancer, progression, sequence, is, the, classical, model, of, colorectal, cancer, pathogenesis, in, this, adenoma, carcinoma, sequence, normal, epithelial, cells, progress, to, dysplastic, cells, such, as, adenomas, and, then, to, carcinoma, by, a, process, of, progressive, genetic, mutation, central, to, the, polyp, to, crc, sequence, are, gene, mutations, epigenetic, alterations, and, local, inflammatory, changes, the, polyp, to, crc, sequence, can, be, used, as, an, underlying, framework, to, illustrate, how, specific, molecular, changes, lead, to, various, cancer, subtypes, the, term, field, cancerization, was, first, used, in, 1953, to, describe, an, area, or, field, of, epithelium, that, has, been, preconditioned, by, what, were, largely, unknown, processes, at, the, time, to, predispose, it, towards, development, of, cancer, since, then, the, terms, field, cancerization, field, carcinogenesis, field, defect, and, field, effect, have, been, used, to, describe, pre, malignant, or, pre, neoplastic, tissue, in, which, new, cancers, are, likely, to, arise, field, defects, are, important, in, progression, to, colon, cancer, however, as, pointed, out, by, rubin, the, vast, majority, of, studies, in, cancer, research, has, been, done, on, well, defined, tumors, in, vivo, or, on, discrete, neoplastic, foci, in, vitro, yet, there, is, evidence, that, more, than, 80, of, the, somatic, mutations, found, in, mutator, phenotype, human, colorectal, tumors, occur, before, the, onset, of, terminal, clonal, expansion, similarly, vogelstein, et, al, pointed, out, that, more, than, half, of, somatic, mutations, identified, in, tumors, occurred, in, a, pre, neoplastic, phase, in, a, field, defect, during, growth, of, apparently, normal, cells, likewise, epigenetic, alterations, present, in, tumors, may, have, occurred, in, pre, neoplastic, field, defects, an, expanded, view, of, field, effect, has, been, termed, etiologic, field, effect, which, encompasses, not, only, molecular, and, pathologic, changes, in, pre, neoplastic, cells, but, also, influences, of, exogenous, environmental, factors, and, molecular, changes, in, the, local, microenvironment, on, neoplastic, evolution, from, tumor, initiation, to, death, epigenetic, alterations, are, much, more, frequent, in, colon, cancer, than, genetic, mutational, alterations, as, described, by, vogelstein, et, al, an, average, cancer, of, the, colon, has, only, 1, or, 2, oncogene, mutations, and, 1, to, 5, tumor, suppressor, mutations, together, designated, driver, mutations, with, about, 60, further, passenger, mutations, the, oncogenes, and, tumor, suppressor, genes, are, well, studied, and, are, described, above, under, pathogenesis, in, addition, to, epigenetic, alteration, of, expression, of, mirnas, other, common, types, of, epigenetic, alterations, in, cancers, that, change, gene, expression, levels, include, direct, hypermethylation, or, hypomethylation, of, cpg, islands, of, protein, encoding, genes, and, alterations, in, histones, and, chromosomal, architecture, that, influence, gene, expression, as, an, example, 147, hypermethylations, and, 27, hypomethylations, of, protein, coding, genes, were, frequently, associated, with, colorectal, cancers, of, the, hypermethylated, genes, 10, were, hypermethylated, in, 100, of, colon, cancers, and, many, others, were, hypermethylated, in, more, than, 50, of, colon, cancers, in, addition, 11, hypermethylations, and, 96, hypomethylations, of, mirnas, were, also, associated, with, colorectal, cancers, abnormal, aberrant, methylation, occurs, as, a, normal, consequence, of, normal, aging, and, the, risk, of, colorectal, cancer, increases, as, a, person, gets, older, the, source, and, trigger, of, this, age, related, methylation, is, unknown, approximately, half, of, the, genes, that, show, age, related, methylation, changes, are, the, same, genes, that, have, been, identified, to, be, involved, in, the, development, of, colorectal, cancer, these, findings, may, suggest, a, reason, for, age, being, associated, with, the, increased, risk, of, developing, colorectal, cancer, epigenetic, reductions, of, dna, repair, enzyme, expression, may, likely, lead, to, the, genomic, and, epigenomic, instability, characteristic, of, cancer, as, summarized, in, the, articles, carcinogenesis, and, neoplasm, for, sporadic, cancers, in, general, a, deficiency, in, dna, repair, is, occasionally, due, to, a, mutation, in, a, dna, repair, gene, but, is, much, more, frequently, due, to, epigenetic, alterations, that, reduce, or, silence, expression, of, dna, repair, genes, epigenetic, alterations, involved, in, the, development, of, colorectal, cancer, may, affect, a, person, s, response, to, chemotherapy, consensus, molecular, subtypes, cms, classification, of, colorectal, cancer, was, first, introduced, in, 2015, cms, classification, so, far, has, been, considered, the, most, robust, classification, system, available, for, crc, that, has, a, clear, biological, interpretability, and, the, basis, for, future, clinical, stratification, and, subtype, based, targeted, interventions, a, novel, epigenome, based, classification, epic, of, colorectal, cancer, was, proposed, in, 2021, introducing, 4, enhancer, subtypes, in, people, with, crc, chromatin, states, using, 6, histone, marks, are, characterized, to, identify, epic, subtypes, a, combinatorial, therapeutic, approach, based, on, the, previously, introduced, consensus, molecular, subtypes, cmss, and, epics, could, significantly, enhance, current, treatment, strategies, colorectal, cancer, diagnosis, is, performed, by, sampling, of, areas, of, the, colon, suspicious, for, possible, tumor, development, typically, during, colonoscopy, or, sigmoidoscopy, depending, on, the, location, of, the, lesion, a, colorectal, cancer, is, sometimes, initially, discovered, on, ct, scan, presence, of, metastases, is, determined, by, a, ct, scan, of, the, chest, abdomen, and, pelvis, other, potential, imaging, tests, such, as, pet, and, mri, may, be, used, in, certain, cases, mri, is, particularly, useful, to, determine, local, stage, of, the, tumor, and, to, plan, the, optimal, surgical, approach, mri, is, also, performed, after, completion, of, neoadjuvant, chemoradiotherapy, to, identify, patients, who, achieve, complete, response, patients, with, complete, response, on, both, mri, and, endoscopy, may, not, require, surgical, resection, and, can, avoid, unnecessary, surgical, morbidity, and, complications, patients, selected, for, non, surgical, treatment, of, rectal, cancer, should, have, periodic, mri, scans, receive, physical, examinations, and, undergo, endoscopy, procedures, to, detect, any, tumor, re, growth, which, can, occur, in, a, minority, of, these, patients, when, local, recurrence, occurs, periodic, follow, up, can, detect, it, when, it, is, still, small, and, curable, with, salvage, surgery, in, addition, mri, tumor, regression, grades, can, be, assigned, after, chemoradiotherapy, which, correlate, with, patients, long, term, survival, outcomes, the, histopathologic, characteristics, of, the, tumor, are, reported, from, the, analysis, of, tissue, taken, from, a, biopsy, or, surgery, a, pathology, report, contains, a, description, of, the, microscopical, characteristics, of, the, tumor, tissue, including, both, tumor, cells, and, how, the, tumor, invades, into, healthy, tissues, and, finally, if, the, tumor, appears, to, be, completely, removed, the, most, common, form, of, colon, cancer, is, adenocarcinoma, constituting, between, 95, and, 98, of, all, cases, of, colorectal, cancer, other, rarer, types, include, lymphoma, adenosquamous, and, squamous, cell, carcinoma, some, subtypes, are, more, aggressive, immunohistochemistry, may, be, used, in, uncertain, cases, staging, of, the, cancer, is, based, on, both, radiological, and, pathological, findings, as, with, most, other, forms, of, cancer, tumor, staging, is, based, on, the, tnm, system, which, considers, how, much, the, initial, tumor, has, spread, and, the, presence, of, metastases, in, lymph, nodes, and, more, distant, organs, the, ajcc, 8th, edition, was, published, in, 2018, it, has, been, estimated, that, about, half, of, colorectal, cancer, cases, are, due, to, lifestyle, factors, and, about, a, quarter, of, all, cases, are, preventable, increasing, surveillance, engaging, in, physical, activity, consuming, a, diet, high, in, fiber, quitting, smoking, and, limiting, alcohol, consumption, decrease, the, risk, lifestyle, risk, factors, with, strong, evidence, include, lack, of, exercise, cigarette, smoking, alcohol, and, obesity, the, risk, of, colon, cancer, can, be, reduced, by, maintaining, a, normal, body, weight, through, a, combination, of, sufficient, exercise, and, eating, a, healthy, diet, current, research, consistently, links, eating, more, red, meat, and, processed, meat, to, a, higher, risk, of, the, disease, starting, in, the, 1970s, dietary, recommendations, to, prevent, colorectal, cancer, often, included, increasing, the, consumption, of, whole, grains, fruits, and, vegetables, and, reducing, the, intake, of, red, meat, and, processed, meats, this, was, based, on, animal, studies, and, retrospective, observational, studies, however, large, scale, prospective, studies, have, failed, to, demonstrate, a, significant, protective, effect, and, due, to, the, multiple, causes, of, cancer, and, the, complexity, of, studying, correlations, between, diet, and, health, it, is, uncertain, whether, any, specific, dietary, interventions, will, have, significant, protective, effects, 432, 433, 125, 126, in, 2018, the, national, cancer, institute, stated, that, there, is, no, reliable, evidence, that, a, diet, started, in, adulthood, that, is, low, in, fat, and, meat, and, high, in, fiber, fruits, and, vegetables, reduces, the, risk, of, crc, by, a, clinically, important, degree, consuming, alcoholic, drinks, and, consuming, processed, meat, both, increase, the, risk, of, colorectal, cancer, the, 2014, world, health, organization, cancer, report, noted, that, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, dietary, fiber, might, help, prevent, colorectal, cancer, but, that, most, studies, at, the, time, had, not, yet, studied, the, correlation, a, 2019, review, however, found, evidence, of, benefit, from, dietary, fiber, and, whole, grains, the, world, cancer, research, fund, listed, the, benefit, of, fiber, for, prevention, of, colorectal, cancer, as, probable, as, of, 2017, a, 2022, umbrella, review, says, there, is, convincing, evidence, for, that, association, higher, physical, activity, is, recommended, physical, exercise, is, associated, with, a, modest, reduction, in, colon, but, not, rectal, cancer, risk, high, levels, of, physical, activity, reduce, the, risk, of, colon, cancer, by, about, 21, sitting, regularly, for, prolonged, periods, is, associated, with, higher, mortality, from, colon, cancer, regular, exercise, does, not, negate, the, risk, but, does, lower, it, aspirin, and, celecoxib, appear, to, decrease, the, risk, of, colorectal, cancer, in, those, at, high, risk, aspirin, is, recommended, in, those, who, are, 50, to, 60, years, old, do, not, have, an, increased, risk, of, bleeding, and, are, at, risk, for, cardiovascular, disease, to, prevent, colorectal, cancer, it, is, not, recommended, in, those, at, average, risk, there, is, tentative, evidence, for, calcium, supplementation, but, it, is, not, sufficient, to, make, a, recommendation, vitamin, d, intake, and, blood, levels, are, associated, with, a, lower, risk, of, colon, cancer, as, more, than, 80, of, colorectal, cancers, arise, from, adenomatous, polyps, screening, for, this, cancer, is, effective, for, both, early, detection, and, for, prevention, diagnosis, of, cases, of, colorectal, cancer, through, screening, tends, to, occur, 2, 3, years, before, diagnosis, of, cases, with, symptoms, any, polyps, that, are, detected, can, be, removed, usually, by, colonoscopy, or, sigmoidoscopy, and, thus, prevent, them, from, turning, into, cancer, screening, has, the, potential, to, reduce, colorectal, cancer, deaths, by, 60, the, three, main, screening, tests, are, colonoscopy, fecal, occult, blood, testing, and, flexible, sigmoidoscopy, of, the, three, only, sigmoidoscopy, cannot, screen, the, right, side, of, the, colon, where, 42, of, cancers, are, found, flexible, sigmoidoscopy, however, has, the, best, evidence, for, decreasing, the, risk, of, death, from, any, cause, fecal, occult, blood, testing, fobt, of, the, stool, is, typically, recommended, every, two, years, and, can, be, either, guaiac, based, or, immunochemical, if, abnormal, fobt, results, are, found, participants, are, typically, referred, for, a, follow, up, colonoscopy, examination, when, done, once, every, 1, 2, years, fobt, screening, reduces, colorectal, cancer, deaths, by, 16, and, among, those, participating, in, screening, colorectal, cancer, deaths, can, be, reduced, up, to, 23, although, it, has, not, been, proven, to, reduce, all, cause, mortality, immunochemical, tests, are, accurate, and, do, not, require, dietary, or, medication, changes, before, testing, however, research, in, the, uk, has, found, that, for, these, immunochemical, tests, the, threshold, for, further, investigation, is, set, at, a, point, that, may, miss, more, than, half, of, bowel, cancer, cases, the, research, suggests, that, the, nhs, england, s, bowel, cancer, screening, programme, could, make, better, use, of, the, test, s, ability, to, provide, the, exact, concentration, of, blood, in, faeces, rather, than, only, whether, it, is, above, or, below, a, cutoff, level, other, options, include, virtual, colonoscopy, and, stool, dna, screening, testing, fit, dna, virtual, colonoscopy, via, a, ct, scan, appears, as, good, as, standard, colonoscopy, for, detecting, cancers, and, large, adenomas, but, is, expensive, associated, with, radiation, exposure, and, cannot, remove, any, detected, abnormal, growths, as, standard, colonoscopy, can, stool, dna, screening, test, looks, for, biomarkers, associated, with, colorectal, cancer, and, precancerous, lesions, including, altered, dna, and, blood, hemoglobin, a, positive, result, should, be, followed, by, colonoscopy, fit, dna, has, more, false, positives, than, fit, and, thus, results, in, more, adverse, effects, further, study, is, required, as, of, 2016, to, determine, whether, a, three, year, screening, interval, is, correct, in, the, united, states, screening, is, typically, recommended, between, ages, 50, and, 75, years, the, american, cancer, society, recommends, starting, at, the, age, of, 45, for, those, between, 76, and, 85, years, old, the, decision, to, screen, should, be, individualized, for, those, at, high, risk, screenings, usually, begin, at, around, 40, several, screening, methods, are, recommended, including, stool, based, tests, every, 2, years, sigmoidoscopy, every, 10, years, with, fecal, immunochemical, testing, every, two, years, and, colonoscopy, every, 10, years, it, is, unclear, which, of, these, two, methods, is, better, colonoscopy, may, find, more, cancers, in, the, first, part, of, the, colon, but, is, associated, with, greater, cost, and, more, complications, for, people, with, average, risk, who, have, had, a, high, quality, colonoscopy, with, normal, results, the, american, gastroenterological, association, does, not, recommend, any, type, of, screening, in, the, 10, years, following, the, colonoscopy, for, people, over, 75, or, those, with, a, life, expectancy, of, less, than, 10, years, screening, is, not, recommended, it, takes, about, 10, years, after, screening, for, one, out, of, a, 1000, people, to, benefit, the, uspstf, list, seven, potential, strategies, for, screening, with, the, most, important, thing, being, that, at, least, one, of, these, strategies, is, appropriately, used, in, canada, among, those, 50, to, 75, years, old, at, normal, risk, fecal, immunochemical, testing, or, fobt, is, recommended, every, two, years, or, sigmoidoscopy, every, 10, years, colonoscopy, is, less, preferred, some, countries, have, national, colorectal, screening, programs, which, offer, fobt, screening, for, all, adults, within, a, certain, age, group, typically, starting, between, ages, 50, and, 60, examples, of, countries, with, organised, screening, include, the, united, kingdom, australia, the, netherlands, hong, kong, and, taiwan, the, uk, bowel, cancer, screening, programme, aims, to, find, warning, signs, in, people, aged, 60, to, 74, by, recommending, a, faecal, immunochemical, test, fit, every, two, years, fit, measures, blood, in, faeces, and, people, with, levels, above, a, certain, threshold, may, have, bowel, tissue, examined, for, signs, of, cancer, growths, having, cancerous, potential, are, removed, the, treatment, of, colorectal, cancer, can, be, aimed, at, cure, or, palliation, the, decision, on, which, aim, to, adopt, depends, on, various, factors, including, the, person, s, health, and, preferences, as, well, as, the, stage, of, the, tumor, assessment, in, multidisciplinary, teams, is, a, critical, part, of, determining, whether, the, patient, is, suitable, for, surgery, or, not, when, colorectal, cancer, is, caught, early, surgery, can, be, curative, however, when, it, is, detected, at, later, stages, for, which, metastases, are, present, this, is, less, likely, and, treatment, is, often, directed, at, palliation, to, relieve, symptoms, caused, by, the, tumour, and, keep, the, person, as, comfortable, as, possible, at, an, early, stage, colorectal, cancer, may, be, removed, during, a, colonoscopy, using, one, of, several, techniques, including, endoscopic, mucosal, resection, or, endoscopic, submucosal, dissection, endoscopic, resection, is, possible, if, there, is, low, possibility, of, lymph, node, metastasis, and, the, size, and, location, of, the, tumor, make, en, bloc, resection, possible, for, people, with, localized, cancer, the, preferred, treatment, is, complete, surgical, removal, with, adequate, margins, with, the, attempt, of, achieving, a, cure, the, procedure, of, choice, is, a, partial, colectomy, or, proctocolectomy, for, rectal, lesions, where, the, affected, part, of, the, colon, or, rectum, is, removed, along, with, parts, of, its, mesocolon, and, blood, supply, to, facilitate, removal, of, draining, lymph, nodes, this, can, be, done, either, by, an, open, laparotomy, or, laparoscopically, depending, on, factors, related, to, the, individual, person, and, lesion, factors, the, colon, may, then, be, reconnected, or, a, person, may, have, a, colostomy, if, there, are, only, a, few, metastases, in, the, liver, or, lungs, these, may, also, be, removed, chemotherapy, may, be, used, before, surgery, to, shrink, the, cancer, before, attempting, to, remove, it, the, two, most, common, sites, of, recurrence, of, colorectal, cancer, are, the, liver, and, lungs, for, peritoneal, carcinomatosis, cytoreductive, surgery, sometimes, in, combination, with, hipec, can, be, used, in, an, attempt, to, remove, the, cancer, in, both, cancer, of, the, colon, and, rectum, chemotherapy, may, be, used, in, addition, to, surgery, in, certain, cases, the, decision, to, add, chemotherapy, in, management, of, colon, and, rectal, cancer, depends, on, the, stage, of, the, disease, in, stage, i, colon, cancer, no, chemotherapy, is, offered, and, surgery, is, the, definitive, treatment, the, role, of, chemotherapy, in, stage, ii, colon, cancer, is, debatable, and, is, usually, not, offered, unless, risk, factors, such, as, t4, tumor, undifferentiated, tumor, vascular, and, perineural, invasion, or, inadequate, lymph, node, sampling, is, identified, it, is, also, known, that, the, people, who, carry, abnormalities, of, the, mismatch, repair, genes, do, not, benefit, from, chemotherapy, for, stage, iii, and, stage, iv, colon, cancer, chemotherapy, is, an, integral, part, of, treatment, if, cancer, has, spread, to, the, lymph, nodes, or, distant, organs, which, is, the, case, with, stage, iii, and, stage, iv, colon, cancer, respectively, adding, chemotherapy, agents, fluorouracil, capecitabine, or, oxaliplatin, increases, life, expectancy, if, the, lymph, nodes, do, not, contain, cancer, the, benefits, of, chemotherapy, are, controversial, if, the, cancer, is, widely, metastatic, or, unresectable, treatment, is, then, palliative, typically, in, this, setting, a, number, of, different, chemotherapy, medications, may, be, used, chemotherapy, drugs, for, this, condition, may, include, capecitabine, fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and, uft, the, drugs, capecitabine, and, fluorouracil, are, interchangeable, with, capecitabine, being, an, oral, medication, and, fluorouracil, being, an, intravenous, medicine, some, specific, regimens, used, for, crc, are, capox, folfox, folfoxiri, and, folfiri, antiangiogenic, drugs, such, as, bevacizumab, are, often, added, in, first, line, therapy, another, class, of, drugs, used, in, the, second, line, setting, are, epidermal, growth, factor, receptor, inhibitors, of, which, the, three, fda, approved, ones, are, aflibercept, cetuximab, and, panitumumab, the, primary, difference, in, the, approach, to, low, stage, rectal, cancer, is, the, incorporation, of, radiation, therapy, often, it, is, used, in, conjunction, with, chemotherapy, in, a, neoadjuvant, fashion, to, enable, surgical, resection, so, that, ultimately, a, colostomy, is, not, required, however, it, may, not, be, possible, in, low, lying, tumors, in, which, case, a, permanent, colostomy, may, be, required, stage, iv, rectal, cancer, is, treated, similar, to, stage, iv, colon, cancer, stage, iv, colorectal, cancer, due, to, peritoneal, carcinomatosis, can, be, treated, using, hipec, combined, with, cytoreductive, surgery, in, some, people, also, t4, colorectal, cancer, can, be, treated, with, hipec, to, avoid, future, relapses, while, a, combination, of, radiation, and, chemotherapy, may, be, useful, for, rectal, cancer, for, some, people, requiring, treatment, chemoradiotherapy, can, increase, acute, treatment, related, toxicity, and, has, not, been, shown, to, improve, survival, rates, compared, to, radiotherapy, alone, although, it, is, associated, with, less, local, recurrence, the, use, of, radiotherapy, in, colon, cancer, is, not, routine, due, to, the, sensitivity, of, the, bowels, to, radiation, as, with, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, can, be, used, as, a, neoadjuvant, for, clinical, stages, t3, and, t4, for, rectal, cancer, this, results, in, downsizing, or, downstaging, of, the, tumour, preparing, it, for, surgical, resection, and, also, decreases, local, recurrence, rates, for, locally, advanced, rectal, cancer, neoadjuvant, chemoradiotherapy, has, become, the, standard, treatment, additionally, when, surgery, is, not, possible, radiation, therapy, has, been, suggested, to, be, an, effective, treatment, against, crc, pulmonary, metastases, which, are, developed, by, 10, 15, of, people, with, crc, immunotherapy, with, immune, checkpoint, inhibitors, has, been, found, to, be, useful, for, a, type, of, colorectal, cancer, with, mismatch, repair, deficiency, and, microsatellite, instability, pembrolizumab, is, approved, for, advanced, crc, tumours, that, are, mmr, deficient, and, have, failed, usual, treatments, most, people, who, do, improve, however, still, worsen, after, months, or, years, on, the, other, hand, in, a, prospective, phase, 2, study, published, in, june, 2022, in, the, new, england, journal, of, medicine, 12, patients, with, deficient, mismatch, repair, dmmr, stage, ii, or, iii, rectal, adenocarcinoma, were, administered, single, agent, dostarlimab, an, anti, pd, 1, monoclonal, antibody, every, three, weeks, for, six, months, after, a, median, follow, up, of, 12, months, range, 6, to, 25, months, all, 12, patients, had, a, complete, clinical, response, with, no, evidence, of, tumor, on, mri, 18f, fluorodeoxyglucose, positron, emission, tomography, endoscopic, evaluation, digital, rectal, examination, or, biopsy, moreover, no, patient, in, the, trial, needed, chemoradiotherapy, or, surgery, and, no, patient, reported, adverse, events, of, grade, 3, or, higher, however, although, the, results, of, this, study, are, promising, the, study, is, small, and, has, uncertainties, about, long, term, outcomes, palliative, care, is, recommended, for, any, person, who, has, advanced, colon, cancer, or, who, has, significant, symptoms, involvement, of, palliative, care, may, be, beneficial, to, improve, the, quality, of, life, for, both, the, person, and, his, or, her, family, by, improving, symptoms, anxiety, and, preventing, admissions, to, the, hospital, in, people, with, incurable, colorectal, cancer, palliative, care, can, consist, of, procedures, that, relieve, symptoms, or, complications, from, the, cancer, but, do, not, attempt, to, cure, the, underlying, cancer, thereby, improving, quality, of, life, surgical, options, may, include, non, curative, surgical, removal, of, some, of, the, cancer, tissue, bypassing, part, of, the, intestines, or, stent, placement, these, procedures, can, be, considered, to, improve, symptoms, and, reduce, complications, such, as, bleeding, from, the, tumor, abdominal, pain, and, intestinal, obstruction, non, operative, methods, of, symptomatic, treatment, include, radiation, therapy, to, decrease, tumor, size, as, well, as, pain, medications, in, addition, to, medical, intervention, a, variety, of, psychosocial, interventions, have, been, implemented, to, address, psychosocial, concerns, in, the, context, of, colorectal, cancer, depression, and, anxiety, are, highly, prevalent, in, patients, diagnosed, with, crc, therefore, psychosocial, interventions, can, be, helpful, for, alleviating, psychological, distress, many, patients, continue, to, experience, symptoms, of, anxiety, and, depression, following, treatment, regardless, of, treatment, outcome, societal, stigmas, associated, with, colorectal, cancer, present, further, psychosocial, challenges, for, crc, patients, and, their, families, colorectal, cancer, patients, have, a, 51, higher, risk, of, experiencing, depression, than, individuals, without, the, disease, additionally, crc, patients, are, at, high, risk, of, experiencing, severe, anxiety, low, self, esteem, poor, self, concept, and, social, anxiety, regardless, of, treatment, outcome, many, crc, patients, experience, ongoing, symptoms, of, anxiety, depression, and, distress, survivorship, of, crc, can, involve, significant, lifestyle, adjustments, postoperative, afflictions, may, include, stomas, bowel, issues, incontinence, odor, and, changes, to, sexual, functioning, these, changes, can, result, in, distorted, body, image, social, anxiety, depression, and, distress, all, of, which, contribute, to, a, poorer, quality, of, life, colorectal, cancer, is, the, second, leading, cause, of, cancer, related, death, worldwide, transitioning, into, palliative, care, and, contending, with, mortality, can, be, a, deeply, distressing, experience, for, a, crc, patient, and, their, loved, ones, colorectal, cancer, is, highly, stigmatized, and, can, elicit, feelings, of, disgust, from, patients, healthcare, professionals, family, intimate, partners, and, the, general, public, patients, with, stomas, are, especially, vulnerable, to, stigmatization, due, to, unavoidable, odors, gas, and, unpleasant, noises, from, stoma, bags, additionally, associated, crc, risk, factors, like, poor, diet, alcohol, consumption, and, lack, of, physical, activity, prompt, negative, assumptions, of, blame, and, personal, responsibility, onto, crc, patients, judgement, from, others, along, with, internalized, self, blame, and, embarrassment, can, negatively, affect, self, esteem, sociability, and, quality, of, life, face, to, face, interventions, such, as, clinician, patient, talk, therapy, body, mind, spirit, practices, and, support, group, sessions, have, been, identified, as, most, effective, in, reducing, anxiety, and, depression, in, crc, patients, additionally, journaling, exercises, and, over, the, phone, talk, therapy, sessions, have, been, implemented, though, deemed, less, effective, these, non, face, to, face, interventions, are, economically, inclusive, and, have, been, found, to, reduce, both,

are, linked, to, outcomes, in, colorectal, cancer, these, include, both, unfavorable, genes, where, high, expression, is, related, to, poor, outcome, for, example, the, heat, shock, 70, kda, protein, 1, hspa1a, and, favorable, genes, where, high, expression, is, associated, with, better, survival, for, example, the, putative, rna, binding, protein, 3, rbm3, the, prognosis, is, also, correlated, with, a, poor, fidelity, of, the, pre, mrna, splicing, apparatus, and, thus, a, high, number, of, deviating, alternative, splicing, the, average, five, year, recurrence, rate, in, people, with, colon, cancer, where, surgery, is, successful, is, 5, for, stage, i, cancers, 12, in, stage, ii, and, 33, in, stage, iii, however, depending, on, the, number, of, risk, factors, it, ranges, from, 9, 22, in,

from, 4, 11, in, stage, 0, 6, 12, in, stage, i, 11, 28, in, stage, ii, and, 15, 43, in, stage, iii, the, recurrence, rates, have, decreased, over, the, past, decades, as, a, result, of, improvements, in, the, colorectal, cancer, management, the, risk, of, recurrence, after, five, years, of, surveillance, remain, very, low, in, europe, the, five, year, survival, rate, for, colorectal, cancer, is, less, than, 60, in, the, developed, world, about, a, third, of, people, who, get, the, disease, die, from, it, survival, is, directly, related, to, detection, and, the, type, of, cancer, involved, but, overall, is, poor, for, symptomatic, cancers, as, they, are, typically, quite, advanced, survival, rates, for, early, stage, detection, are, about, five, times, that, of, late, stage, cancers, people, with, a, tumor, that, has, not, breached, the, muscularis, mucosa, tnm, stage, tis, n0, m0, have, a, five, year, survival, rate, of, 100, while, those, with, invasive, cancer, of, t1, within,

according, to, a, nationwide, population, based, study, whilst, the, impact, of, colorectal, cancer, on, those, who, survive, varies, greatly, there, will, often, be, a, need, to, adapt, to, both, physical, and, psychological, outcomes, of, the, illness, and, its, treatment, for, example, it, is, common, for, people, to, experience, incontinence, sexual, dysfunction, problems, with, stoma, care, and, fear, of, cancer, recurrence, after, primary, treatment, has, concluded, a, qualitative, systematic, review, published, in, 2021, highlighted, that, there, are, three, main, factors, influencing, adaptation, to, living, with, and, beyond, colorectal, cancer, support, mechanisms, severity, of, late, effects, of, treatment, and, psychosocial, adjustment, therefore, it, is, essential, that, people, are, offered, appropriate, support, to, help, them, better, adapt, to, life, following, treatment, globally, more, than, 1, million, people, get, colorectal, cancer, every, year, resulting, in, about, 715, 000, deaths, as, of, 2010, up, from, 490, 000, in, 1990, as, of, 2012, it, is, the, second, most, common, cause, of, cancer, in, women, 9, 2, of, diagnoses, and, the, third, most, common, in, men, 10, 0, 16, with, it, being, the, fourth, most, common, cause, of, cancer, death, after, lung, stomach, and, liver, cancer, it, is, more, common, in, developed, than, developing, countries, global, incidence, varies, 10, fold, with, highest, rates, in, australia, new, zealand, europe, and, the, us, and, lowest, rates, in, africa, and, south, central, asia, in, 2022, the, incidence, of, colorectal, cancer, in, the, united, states, was, anticipated, to, be, about, 151, 000, adults, including, over, 106, 000, new, cases, of, colon, cancer, some, 54, 000, men, and, 52, 000, women, and, about, 45, 000, new, cases, of, rectal, cancer, since, the, 1980s, the, incidence, of, colorectal, cancer, decreased, dropping, by, about, 2, annually, from, 2014, to, 2018, in, adults, aged, 50, and, older, due, mainly, to, improved, screening, however, incidence, of, colorectal, cancer, has, increased, in, individuals, aged, 25, to, 50, in, early, 2023, the, american, cancer, society, acs, reported, that, 20, of, diagnoses, of, colon, cancer, in, 2019, were, in, patients, under, age, 55, which, is, about, double, the, rate, in, 1995, and, rates, of, advanced, disease, increased, by, about, 3, annually, in, people, younger, than, 50, it, predicted, that, in, 2023, an, estimated, 19, 550, diagnoses, and, 3, 750, deaths, would, be, in, people, younger, than, 50, colorectal, cancer, also, disproportionately, affects, the, black, community, where, the, rates, are, the, highest, of, any, racial, ethnic, group, in, the, us, african, americans, are, about, 20, more, likely, to, get, colorectal, cancer, and, about, 40, more, likely, to, die, from, it, than, most, other, groups, black, americans, often, experience, greater, obstacles, to, cancer, prevention, detection, treatment, and, survival, including, systemic, racial, disparities, that, are, complex, and, go, beyond, the, obvious, connection, to, cancer, in, the, uk, about, 41, 000, people, a, year, get, colon, cancer, making, it, the, fourth, most, common, type, one, in, 19, men, and, one, in, 28, women, in, australia, will, develop, colorectal, cancer, before, the, age, of, 75, one, in, 10,

islands, colorectal, cancer, is, a, very, rare, cancer, amongst, the, people, which, is, least, common, compared, to, lung, stomach, liver, or, breast, cancer, it, is, estimated, that, at, least, 8, in, 100, 000, of, the, people, are, most, likely, to, developed, colorectal, cancer, every, year, which, is, unlike, lung, or, breast, cancer, where, for, the, latter, alone, is, 24, in, 100, 000, women, a, diagnosis, of, colorectal, cancer, in, patients, under, 50, years, of, age, is, referred, to, as, early, onset, colorectal, cancer, eocc, instances, of, eocc, have, increased, over, the, last, decade, specifically, in, patient, populations, aged, 20, to, 40, years, old, throughout, north, america, europe, australia, and, china, the, incidence, of, colorectal, cancer, in, younger, populations, has, increased, over, the, last, decade, while, advancements, in, diagnostic, procedure, may, have, some, impact, reduced, likelihood, of, screening, among, these, populations, suggests, detection, bias, is, not, a, major, contributor, to, this, trend, it, is, more, likely, that, cohort, effects, are, contributing, the, population, experiencing, the, greatest, rise, in, eocc, cases, are, men, and, women, aged, 20, to, 29, years, old, with, incidence, increasing, by, 7, 9, per, year, between, 2004, and, 2016, similarly, though, less, severe, men, and, women, aged, 30, to, 39, experienced, an, increase, in, cases, at, a, rate, of, 3, 4, per, year, during, that, same, time, period, despite, these, increases, the, mortality, rate, for, colorectal, cancer, has, remained, the, same, risk, factors, associated, with, eocc, are, akin, to, those, of, all, colorectal, cancer, cases, observed, cohort, effects, are, likely, the, product, of, generational, shifts, in, lifestyle, and, environmental, factors, in, 2018, the, american, cancer, society, modified, their, previous, screening, guideline, for, colorectal, cancer, from, age, 50, down, to, age, 45, following, the, recognition, of, increasing, cases, of, eocc, individuals, under, the, age, of, 60, have, been, identified, as, most, susceptible, to, non, participation, in, colorectal, cancer, screening, rectal,
