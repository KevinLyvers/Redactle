as, well, as, toe, tufts, and, ear, tufts, some, long, haired, cats, are, not, able, to, maintain, their, own, coat, which, must, be, frequently, groomed, by, a, human, or, may, be, prone, to, matting, because, of, their, wide, gene, pool, domestic, long, haireds, are, not, predisposed, to, any, genetically, inherited, problems, having, apparently, originated, in, western, asia, domestic, long, haired, cats, have, been, kept, as, pets, around, the, world, for, several, centuries, during, the, 16th, century, the, first, long, haired, cats, were, imported, into, europe, in, the, mid, 17th, century, when, the, great, plague, of, london, decimated, much, of, london, s, human, population, the, number, of, cats, started, to, recover, after, centuries, of, persecution, as, they, were, encouraged, as, protectors, from, flea, carrying, rats, how, the, variant, developed, is, still, a, matter, of, speculation, the, long, coat, may, have, been, the, result, of, a, recessive, mutant, gene, when, a, long, haired, cat, is, mated, to, one, with, a, short, coat, only, short, haired, kittens, can, result, however, their, offspring, when, mated, can, produce, a, proportion, of, long, coated, kittens, successive, litters, of, early, european, long, haired, cats, produced, more, and, more, long, coated, offspring, which, were, more, likely, to, survive, in, the, cooler, european, climates, by, the, year, 1521, around, the, time, they, were, first, documented, in, italy, the, variety, had, become, fixed, after, only, a, few, generations, in, the, late, 18th, century, peter, simon, pallas, advanced, the, hypothesis, that, the, manul, also, known, as, pallas, s, cat, might, be, the, ancestor, of, the, long, haired, domestic, cat, he, had, anecdotal, evidence, that, established, even, though, the, male, offspring, would, be, sterile, hybrids, the, female, offspring, could, again, reproduce, with, domestic, cats, and, pass, on, a, small, proportion, of, the, manul, s, genes, in, 1907, zoologist, reginald, innes, pocock, refuted, this, claim, citing, his, work, on, the, skull, differences, between, the, manul, and, the, angoras, or, persians, of, his, time, this, early, hypothesis, overlooked, the, potential, for, crossbreeding, within, the, family, felidae, for, example, the, savannah, cat, is, a, crossbreed, between, a, domestic, short, haired, cat, and, a, wild, serval, both, of, which, have, different, skulls, and, evolutionary, lineage, furthermore, hybrid, females, in, the, related, genus, panthera, such, as, ligers, and, tigons, have, successfully, mated, producing, tiligers, and, litigons, the, first, modern, formal, breeds, of, long, haired, cats, were, the, persian, and, the, angora, named, after, ankara, turkey, and, were, said, to, have, come, from, those, two, areas
