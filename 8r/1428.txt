gonorrhoea, or, gonorrhea, colloquially, known, as, the, clap, is, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, sti, caused, by, the, bacterium, neisseria, gonorrhoeae, infection, may, involve, the, genitals, mouth, or, rectum, infected, men, may, experience, pain, or, burning, with, urination, discharge, from, the, penis, or, testicular, pain, infected, women, may, experience, burning, with, urination, vaginal, discharge, vaginal, bleeding, between, periods, or, pelvic, pain, complications, in, women, include, pelvic, inflammatory, disease, and, in, men, include, inflammation, of, the, epididymis, many, of, those, infected, however, have, no, symptoms, if, untreated, gonorrhea, can, spread, to, joints, or, heart, valves, gonorrhea, is, spread, through, sexual, contact, with, an, infected, person, this, includes, oral, anal, and, vaginal, sex, it, can, also, spread, from, a, mother, to, a, child, during, birth, diagnosis, is, by, testing, the, urine, urethra, in, males, or, cervix, in, females, testing, all, women, who, are, sexually, active, and, less, than, 25, years, of, age, each, year, as, well, as, those, with, new, sexual, partners, is, recommended, the, same, recommendation, applies, in, men, who, have, sex, with, men, msm, gonorrhea, can, be, prevented, with, the, use, of, condoms, having, sex, with, only, one, person, who, is, uninfected, and, by, not, having, sex, treatment, is, usually, with, ceftriaxone, by, injection, and, azithromycin, by, mouth, resistance, has, developed, to, many, previously, used, antibiotics, and, higher, doses, of, ceftriaxone, are, occasionally, required, retesting, is, recommended, three, months, after, treatment, sexual, partners, from, the, last, two, months, should, also, be, offered, treatment, gonorrhea, affects, about, 0, 8, of, women, and, 0, 6, of, men, an, estimated, 33, to, 106, million, new, cases, occur, each, year, out, of, the, 498, million, new, cases, of, curable, sti, which, also, includes, syphilis, chlamydia, and, trichomoniasis, infections, in, women, most, commonly, occur, when, they, are, young, adults, in, 2015, it, caused, about, 700, deaths, descriptions, of, the, disease, date, back, to, before, the, common, era, within, the, hebrew, bible, old, testament, leviticus, 15, 2, 3, the, current, name, was, first, used, by, the, greek, physician, galen, before, ad, 200, who, referred, to, it, as, an, unwanted, discharge, of, semen, gonorrhea, infections, of, mucosal, membranes, can, cause, swelling, itching, pain, and, the, formation, of, pus, the, time, from, exposure, to, symptoms, is, usually, between, two, and, 14, days, with, most, symptoms, appearing, between, four, and, six, days, after, infection, if, they, appear, at, all, both, men, and, women, with, infections, of, the, throat, may, experience, a, sore, throat, though, such, infection, does, not, produce, symptoms, in, 90, of, cases, other, symptoms, may, include, swollen, lymph, nodes, around, the, neck, either, sex, can, become, infected, in, the, eyes, or, rectum, if, these, tissues, are, exposed, to, the, bacterium, which, can, lead, to, pain, with, bowel, movements, rectal, discharge, or, constipation, half, of, women, with, gonorrhea, are, asymptomatic, but, the, other, half, experience, vaginal, discharge, lower, abdominal, pain, or, pain, with, sexual, intercourse, associated, with, inflammation, of, the, uterine, cervix, common, medical, complications, of, untreated, gonorrhea, in, women, include, pelvic, inflammatory, disease, which, can, cause, scars, to, the, fallopian, tubes, and, result, in, later, ectopic, pregnancy, among, those, women, who, become, pregnant, most, infected, men, with, symptoms, have, inflammation, of, the, penile, urethra, associated, with, a, burning, sensation, during, urination, and, discharge, from, the, penis, in, men, discharge, with, or, without, burning, occurs, in, half, of, all, cases, and, is, the, most, common, symptom, of, the, infection, this, pain, is, caused, by, a, narrowing, and, stiffening, of, the, urethral, lumen, the, most, common, medical, complication, of, gonorrhea, in, men, is, inflammation, of, the, epididymis, gonorrhea, is, also, associated, with, increased, risk, of, prostate, cancer, if, not, treated, gonococcal, ophthalmia, neonatorum, will, develop, in, 28, of, infants, born, to, women, with, gonorrhea, if, left, untreated, gonorrhea, can, spread, from, the, original, site, of, infection, and, infect, and, damage, the, joints, skin, and, other, organs, indications, of, this, can, include, fever, skin, rashes, sores, and, joint, pain, and, swelling, in, advanced, cases, gonorrhea, may, cause, a, general, feeling, of, tiredness, similar, to, other, infections, it, is, also, possible, for, an, individual, to, have, an, allergic, reaction, to, the, bacteria, in, which, case, any, appearing, symptoms, will, be, greatly, intensified, very, rarely, it, may, settle, in, the, heart, causing, endocarditis, or, in, the, spinal, column, causing, meningitis, both, are, more, likely, among, individuals, with, suppressed, immune, systems, however, gonorrhea, is, caused, by, the, bacterium, neisseria, gonorrhoeae, previous, infection, does, not, confer, immunity, a, person, who, has, been, infected, can, become, infected, again, by, exposure, to, someone, who, is, infected, infected, persons, may, be, able, to, infect, others, repeatedly, without, having, any, signs, or, symptoms, of, their, own, the, infection, is, usually, spread, from, one, person, to, another, through, vaginal, oral, or, anal, sex, men, have, a, 20, risk, of, getting, the, infection, from, a, single, act, of, vaginal, intercourse, with, an, infected, woman, the, risk, for, men, who, have, sex, with, men, msm, is, higher, insertive, msm, may, get, a, penile, infection, from, anal, intercourse, while, receptive, msm, may, get, anorectal, gonorrhea, women, have, a, 60, 80, risk, of, getting, the, infection, from, a, single, act, of, vaginal, intercourse, with, an, infected, man, a, mother, may, transmit, gonorrhea, to, her, newborn, during, childbirth, when, affecting, the, infant, s, eyes, it, is, referred, to, as, ophthalmia, neonatorum, it, may, be, able, to, spread, through, the, objects, contaminated, with, body, fluid, from, an, infected, person, the, bacteria, typically, does, not, survive, long, outside, the, body, typically, dying, within, minutes, to, hours, it, is, discovered, that, sexually, active, women, younger, than, 25, and, men, who, have, sex, with, men, are, at, increased, risk, of, getting, gonorrhea, other, risk, factors, include, untreated, gonorrhea, can, lead, to, major, complications, such, as, traditionally, gonorrhea, was, diagnosed, with, gram, stain, and, culture, however, newer, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, based, testing, methods, are, becoming, more, common, if, initial, treatment, fails, a, culture, should, be, done, to, determine, the, sensitivity, of, the, bacteria, to, antibiotics, tests, that, use, pcr, aka, nucleic, acid, amplification, to, identify, genes, unique, to, n, gonorrhoeae, are, recommended, for, screening, and, diagnosis, of, gonorrhea, infection, these, pcr, based, tests, require, a, sample, of, urine, urethral, swabs, or, cervical, vaginal, swabs, culture, growing, colonies, of, bacteria, in, order, to, isolate, and, identify, them, and, gram, stain, staining, of, bacterial, cell, walls, to, reveal, morphology, can, also, be, used, to, detect, the, presence, of, n, gonorrhoeae, in, all, specimen, types, except, urine, studies, of, the, swab, sample, method, for, gonorrhea, infections, have, not, shown, any, difference, in, the, number, of, patients, treated, whether, the, sample, was, collected, at, home, or, in, the, clinic, the, implications, for, number, of, patients, cured, reinfection, rates, partner, management, and, safety, are, unknown, if, gram, negative, oxidase, positive, diplococci, are, visualized, on, direct, gram, stain, of, urethral, pus, male, genital, infection, no, further, testing, is, needed, to, establish, the, diagnosis, of, gonorrhea, infection, however, direct, gram, stain, of, cervical, swabs, is, not, useful, because, the, n, gonorrhoeae, organisms, are, less, concentrated, in, these, samples, the, chance, of, a, false, positive, test, is, also, higher, for, a, cervical, swab, as, gram, negative, diplococci, native, to, the, normal, vaginal, flora, cannot, be, distinguished, from, n, gonorrhoeae, in, that, context, thus, cervical, swabs, must, be, cultured, under, the, conditions, described, above, if, oxidase, positive, gram, negative, diplococci, are, isolated, from, a, culture, of, a, cervical, vaginal, swab, specimen, then, the, diagnosis, is, made, culture, is, especially, useful, for, diagnosis, of, infections, of, the, throat, rectum, eyes, blood, or, joints, areas, where, pcr, based, tests, are, not, well, established, in, all, labs, culture, is, also, useful, for, antimicrobial, sensitivity, testing, analyzing, treatment, failure, and, epidemiological, purposes, outbreaks, surveillance, in, patients, who, may, have, disseminated, gonococcal, infection, dgi, all, possible, mucosal, sites, should, be, cultured, e, g, pharynx, cervix, urethra, rectum, three, sets, of, blood, cultures, should, also, be, obtained, synovial, fluid, should, be, collected, in, cases, of, septic, arthritis, all, people, testing, positive, for, gonorrhea, should, be, tested, for, other, sexually, transmitted, infections, such, as, chlamydia, syphilis, and, human, immunodeficiency, virus, studies, have, found, co, infection, with, chlamydia, ranging, from, 46, to, 54, in, young, people, with, gonorrhea, among, persons, in, the, united, states, between, 14, and, 39, years, of, age, 46, of, people, with, gonorrheal, infection, also, have, chlamydial, infection, for, this, reason, gonorrhea, and, chlamydia, testing, are, often, combined, people, diagnosed, with, gonorrhea, infection, have, a, fivefold, increase, risk, of, hiv, transmission, additionally, infected, persons, who, are, hiv, positive, are, more, likely, to, shed, and, transmit, hiv, to, uninfected, partners, during, an, episode, of, gonorrhea, the, united, states, preventive, services, task, force, uspstf, recommends, screening, for, gonorrhea, in, women, at, increased, risk, of, infection, which, includes, all, sexually, active, women, younger, than, 25, years, extragenital, gonorrhea, and, chlamydia, are, highest, in, men, who, have, sex, with, men, msm, additionally, the, uspstf, also, recommends, routine, screening, in, people, who, have, previously, tested, positive, for, gonorrhea, or, have, multiple, sexual, partners, and, individuals, who, use, condoms, inconsistently, provide, sexual, favors, for, money, or, have, sex, while, under, the, influence, of, alcohol, or, drugs, screening, for, gonorrhea, in, women, who, are, or, intend, to, become, pregnant, and, who, are, found, to, be, at, high, risk, for, sexually, transmitted, infections, is, recommended, as, part, of, prenatal, care, in, the, united, states, as, with, most, sexually, transmitted, infections, the, risk, of, infection, can, be, reduced, significantly, by, the, correct, use, of, condoms, not, having, sex, or, can, be, removed, almost, entirely, by, limiting, sexual, activities, to, a, mutually, monogamous, relationship, with, an, uninfected, person, those, previously, infected, are, encouraged, to, return, for, follow, up, care, to, make, sure, that, the, infection, has, been, eliminated, in, addition, to, the, use, of, phone, contact, the, use, of, email, and, text, messaging, have, been, found, to, improve, the, re, testing, for, infection, newborn, babies, coming, through, the, birth, canal, are, given, erythromycin, ointment, in, the, eyes, to, prevent, blindness, from, infection, the, underlying, gonorrhea, should, be, treated, if, this, is, done, then, usually, a, good, prognosis, will, follow, antibiotics, are, used, to, treat, gonorrhea, infections, as, of, 2016, both, ceftriaxone, by, injection, and, azithromycin, by, mouth, are, most, effective, however, due, to, increasing, rates, of, antibiotic, resistance, local, susceptibility, patterns, must, be, taken, into, account, when, deciding, on, treatment, ertapenem, is, a, potential, effective, alternative, treatment, for, ceftriaxone, resistant, gonorrhea, adults, may, have, eyes, infected, with, gonorrhoea, and, require, proper, personal, hygiene, and, medications, addition, of, topical, antibiotics, have, not, been, shown, to, improve, cure, rates, compared, to, oral, antibiotics, alone, in, treatment, of, eye, infected, gonorrhea, for, newborns, erythromycin, ointment, is, recommended, as, a, preventative, measure, for, gonococcal, infant, conjunctivitis, infections, of, the, throat, can, be, especially, problematic, as, antibiotics, have, difficulty, becoming, sufficiently, concentrated, there, to, destroy, the, bacteria, this, is, amplified, by, the, fact, that, pharyngeal, gonorrhoea, is, mostly, asymptomatic, and, gonococci, and, commensal, neisseria, species, can, coexist, for, long, time, periods, in, the, pharynx, and, share, anti, microbial, resistance, genes, accordingly, an, enhanced, focus, on, early, detection, i, e, screening, of, high, risk, populations, such, as, men, who, have, sex, with, men, pcr, testing, should, be, considered, and, appropriate, treatment, of, pharyngeal, gonorrhoea, is, important, it, is, recommended, that, sexual, partners, be, tested, and, potentially, treated, one, option, for, treating, sexual, partners, of, people, infected, is, patient, delivered, partner, therapy, pdpt, which, involves, providing, prescriptions, or, medications, to, the, person, to, take, to, his, her, partner, without, the, health, care, provider, s, first, examining, him, her, the, united, states, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, currently, recommend, that, individuals, who, have, been, diagnosed, and, treated, for, gonorrhea, avoid, sexual, contact, with, others, until, at, least, one, week, past, the, final, day, of, treatment, in, order, to, prevent, the, spread, of, the, bacterium, many, antibiotics, that, were, once, effective, including, penicillin, tetracycline, and, fluoroquinolones, are, no, longer, recommended, because, of, high, rates, of, resistance, resistance, to, cefixime, has, reached, a, level, such, that, it, is, no, longer, recommended, as, a, first, line, agent, in, the, united, states, and, if, it, is, used, a, person, should, be, tested, again, after, a, week, to, determine, whether, the, infection, still, persists, public, health, officials, are, concerned, that, an, emerging, pattern, of, resistance, may, predict, a, global, epidemic, in, 2016, the, who, published, new, guidelines, for, treatment, stating, there, is, an, urgent, need, to, update, treatment, recommendations, for, gonococcal, infections, to, respond, to, changing, antimicrobial, resistance, amr, patterns, of, n, gonorrhoeae, high, level, resistance, to, previously, recommended, quinolones, is, widespread, and, decreased, susceptibility, to, the, extended, spectrum, third, generation, cephalosporins, another, recommended, first, line, treatment, in, the, 2003, guidelines, is, increasing, and, several, countries, have, reported, treatment, failures, gonorrhea, if, left, untreated, may, last, for, weeks, or, months, with, higher, risks, of, complications, one, of, the, complications, of, gonorrhea, is, systemic, dissemination, resulting, in, skin, pustules, or, petechia, septic, arthritis, meningitis, or, endocarditis, this, occurs, in, between, 0, 6, and, 3, of, infected, women, and, 0, 4, and, 0, 7, of, infected, men, in, men, inflammation, of, the, epididymis, prostate, gland, and, urethra, can, result, from, untreated, gonorrhea, in, women, the, most, common, result, of, untreated, gonorrhea, is, pelvic, inflammatory, disease, other, complications, include, inflammation, of, the, tissue, surrounding, the, liver, a, rare, complication, associated, with, fitz, hugh, curtis, syndrome, septic, arthritis, in, the, fingers, wrists, toes, and, ankles, septic, abortion, chorioamnionitis, during, pregnancy, neonatal, or, adult, blindness, from, conjunctivitis, and, infertility, men, who, have, had, a, gonorrhea, infection, have, an, increased, risk, of, getting, prostate, cancer, about, 88, million, cases, of, gonorrhea, occur, each, year, out, of, the, 448, million, new, cases, of, curable, sti, each, year, that, also, includes, syphilis, chlamydia, and, trichomoniasis, the, prevalence, was, highest, in, the, african, region, the, americas, and, western, pacific, and, lowest, in, europe, in, 2013, it, caused, about, 3, 200, deaths, up, from, 2, 300, in, 1990, in, the, united, kingdom, 196, per, 100, 000, males, 20, to, 24, years, old, and, 133, per, 100, 000, females, 16, to, 19, years, old, were, diagnosed, in, 2005, in, 2013, the, cdc, estimated, that, more, than, 820, 000, people, in, the, united, states, get, a, new, gonorrheal, infection, each, year, fewer, than, half, of, these, infections, are, reported, to, cdc, in, 2011, 321, 849, cases, of, gonorrhea, were, reported, to, the, cdc, after, the, implementation, of, a, national, gonorrhea, control, program, in, the, mid, 1970s, the, national, gonorrhea, rate, declined, from, 1975, to, 1997, after, a, small, increase, in, 1998, the, gonorrhea, rate, has, decreased, slightly, since, 1999, in, 2004, the, rate, of, reported, gonorrheal, infections, was, 113, 5, per, 100, 000, persons, in, the, us, it, is, the, second, most, common, bacterial, sexually, transmitted, infections, chlamydia, remains, first, according, to, the, cdc, african, americans, are, most, affected, by, gonorrhea, accounting, for, 69, of, all, gonorrhea, cases, in, 2010, the, world, health, organization, warned, in, 2017, of, the, spread, of, untreatable, strains, of, gonorrhea, following, analysis, of, at, least, three, cases, in, japan, france, and, spain, which, survived, all, antibiotic, treatment, some, scholars, translate, the, biblical, terms, zav, for, a, male, and, zavah, for, a, female, as, gonorrhea, it, has, been, suggested, that, mercury, was, used, as, a, treatment, for, gonorrhea, surgeons, tools, on, board, the, recovered, english, warship, the, mary, rose, included, a, syringe, that, according, to, some, was, used, to, inject, the, mercury, via, the, urinary, meatus, into, crewmen, with, gonorrhea, the, name, the, clap, in, reference, to, the, disease, is, recorded, as, early, as, the, sixteenth, century, referring, to, a, medieval, red, light, district, in, paris, les, clapiers, translating, to, the, rabbit, holes, it, was, so, named, for, the, small, huts, in, which, prostitutes, worked, silver, nitrate, was, one, of, the, widely, used, drugs, in, the, 19th, century, however, it, became, replaced, by, protargol, arthur, eichengr, n, invented, this, type, of, colloidal, silver, which, was, marketed, by, bayer, from, 1897, onward, the, silver, based, treatment, was, used, until, the, first, antibiotics, came, into, use, in, the, 1940s, the, exact, time, of, onset, of, gonorrhea, as, prevalent, disease, or, epidemic, cannot, be, accurately, determined, from, the, historical, record, one, of, the, first, reliable, notations, occurs, in, the, acts, of, the, english, parliament, in, 1161, this, body, passed, a, law, to, reduce, the, spread, of, the, perilous, infirmity, of, burning, the, symptoms, described, are, consistent, with, but, not, diagnostic, of, gonorrhea, a, similar, decree, was, passed, by, louis, ix, in, france, in, 1256, replacing, regulation, with, banishment, similar, symptoms, were, noted, at, the, siege, of, acre, by, crusaders, coincidental, to, or, dependent, on, the, appearance, of, a, gonorrhea, epidemic, several, changes, occurred, in, european, medieval, society, cities, hired, public, health, doctors, to, treat, affected, patients, without, right, of, refusal, pope, boniface, rescinded, the, requirement, that, physicians, complete, studies, for, the, lower, orders, of, the, catholic, priesthood, medieval, public, health, physicians, in, the, employ, of, their, cities, were, required, to, treat, prostitutes, infected, with, the, burning, as, well, as, lepers, and, other, epidemic, patients, after, pope, boniface, completely, secularized, the, practice, of, medicine, physicians, were, more, willing, to, treat, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, a, vaccine, for, gonorrhea, has, been, developed, that, is, effective, in, mice, it, will, not, be, available, for, human, use, until, further, studies, have, demonstrated, that, it, is, both, safe, and, effective, in, the, human, population, development, of, a, vaccine, has, been, complicated, by, the, ongoing, evolution, of, resistant, strains, and, antigenic, variation, the, ability, of, n, gonorrhoeae, to, disguise, itself, with, different, surface, markers, to, evade, the, immune, system, as, n, gonorrhoeae, is, closely, related, to, n, meningitidis, and, they, have, 80, 90, homology, in, their, genetic, sequences, some, cross, protection, by, meningococcal, vaccines, is, plausible, a, study, published, in, 2017, showed, that, menzb, group, b, meningococcal, vaccine, provided, a, partial, protection, against, gonorrhea, the, vaccine, efficiency, was, calculated, to, be, 31, in, june, 2023, glaxosmithkline, won, fast, track, designation, from, the, food, and, drug, administration, for, its, vaccine, candidate, against, gonorrhea
