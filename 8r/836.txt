o, rosmarus, rosmarus, o, rosmarus, divergens, o, rosmarus, laptevi, debated, the, walrus, odobenus, rosmarus, is, a, large, pinniped, marine, mammal, with, discontinuous, distribution, about, the, north, pole, in, the, arctic, ocean, and, subarctic, seas, of, the, northern, hemisphere, it, is, the, only, extant, species, in, the, family, odobenidae, and, genus, odobenus, this, species, is, subdivided, into, two, subspecies, the, atlantic, walrus, o, r, rosmarus, which, lives, in, the, atlantic, ocean, and, the, pacific, walrus, o, r, divergens, which, lives, in, the, pacific, ocean, adult, walrus, are, characterised, by, prominent, tusks, and, whiskers, and, considerable, bulk, adult, males, in, the, pacific, can, weigh, more, than, 2, 000, kilograms, 4, 400, pounds, and, among, pinnipeds, are, exceeded, in, size, only, by, the, two, species, of, elephant, seals, walrus, live, mostly, in, shallow, waters, above, the, continental, shelves, spending, significant, amounts, of, their, lives, on, the, sea, ice, looking, for, benthic, bivalve, molluscs, walruses, are, relatively, long, lived, social, animals, and, are, considered, to, be, a, keystone, species, in, the, arctic, marine, regions, the, walrus, has, played, a, prominent, role, in, the, cultures, of, many, indigenous, arctic, peoples, who, have, hunted, it, for, meat, fat, skin, tusks, and, bone, during, the, 19th, century, and, the, early, 20th, century, walrus, were, widely, hunted, for, their, blubber, walrus, ivory, and, meat, the, population, of, walruses, dropped, rapidly, all, around, the, arctic, region, it, has, rebounded, somewhat, since, though, the, populations, of, atlantic, and, laptev, walruses, remain, fragmented, and, at, low, levels, compared, with, the, time, before, human, interference, the, origin, of, the, word, walrus, derives, from, a, germanic, language, and, it, has, been, attributed, largely, to, either, the, dutch, language, or, old, norse, its, first, part, is, thought, to, derive, from, a, word, such, as, old, norse, hvalr, whale, and, the, second, part, has, been, hypothesized, to, come, from, the, old, norse, word, hross, horse, for, example, the, old, norse, word, hrosshvalr, means, horse, whale, and, is, thought, to, have, been, passed, in, an, inverted, form, to, both, dutch, and, the, dialects, of, northern, germany, as, walros, and, walross, an, alternative, theory, is, that, it, comes, from, the, dutch, words, wal, shore, and, reus, giant, the, species, name, rosmarus, is, scandinavian, the, norwegian, manuscript, konungs, skuggsj, thought, to, date, from, around, ad, 1240, refers, to, the, walrus, as, rosmhvalr, in, iceland, and, rostungr, in, greenland, walruses, were, by, now, extinct, in, iceland, and, norway, while, the, word, evolved, in, greenland, several, place, names, in, iceland, greenland, and, norway, may, originate, from, walrus, sites, hvalfjord, hvallatrar, and, hvalsnes, to, name, some, all, being, typical, walrus, breeding, grounds, the, archaic, english, word, for, walrus, morse, is, widely, thought, to, have, come, from, the, slavic, languages, which, in, turn, borrowed, it, from, finno, ugric, languages, and, ultimately, according, to, ante, aikio, from, an, unknown, pre, finno, ugric, substrate, language, of, northern, europe, compare, mor, in, russian, mursu, in, finnish, mor, a, in, northern, saami, and, morse, in, french, olaus, magnus, who, depicted, the, walrus, in, the, carta, marina, in, 1539, first, referred, to, the, walrus, as, the, ros, marus, probably, a, latinization, of, mor, and, this, was, adopted, by, linnaeus, in, his, binomial, nomenclature, the, coincidental, similarity, between, morse, and, the, latin, word, morsus, a, bite, supposedly, contributed, to, the, walrus, s, reputation, as, a, terrible, monster, the, compound, odobenus, comes, from, odous, greek, for, teeth, and, baino, greek, for, walk, based, on, observations, of, walruses, using, their, tusks, to, pull, themselves, out, of, the, water, the, term, divergens, in, latin, means, turning, apart, referring, to, their, tusks, the, inuttitut, term, for, the, creature, is, aivik, similar, to, the, inuktitut, word, aiviq, the, walrus, is, a, mammal, in, the, order, carnivora, it, is, the, sole, surviving, member, of, the, family, odobenidae, one, of, three, lineages, in, the, suborder, pinnipedia, along, with, true, seals, phocidae, and, eared, seals, otariidae, while, there, has, been, some, debate, as, to, whether, all, three, lineages, are, monophyletic, i, e, descended, from, a, single, ancestor, or, diphyletic, recent, genetic, evidence, suggests, all, three, descended, from, a, caniform, ancestor, most, closely, related, to, modern, bears, recent, multigene, analysis, indicates, the, odobenids, and, otariids, diverged, from, the, phocids, about, 20, 26, million, years, ago, while, the, odobenids, and, the, otariids, separated, 15, 20, million, years, ago, odobenidae, was, once, a, highly, diverse, and, widespread, family, including, at, least, twenty, species, in, the, subfamilies, imagotariinae, dusignathinae, and, odobeninae, the, key, distinguishing, feature, was, the, development, of, a, squirt, suction, feeding, mechanism, tusks, are, a, later, feature, specific, to, odobeninae, of, which, the, modern, walrus, is, the, last, remaining, relict, species, two, subspecies, of, walrus, are, widely, recognized, the, atlantic, walrus, o, r, rosmarus, linnaeus, 1758, and, the, pacific, walrus, o, r, divergens, illiger, 1815, fixed, genetic, differences, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, subspecies, indicate, very, restricted, gene, flow, but, relatively, recent, separation, estimated, at, 500, 000, and, 785, 000, years, ago, these, dates, coincide, with, the, hypothesis, derived, from, fossils, that, the, walrus, evolved, from, a, tropical, or, subtropical, ancestor, that, became, isolated, in, the, atlantic, ocean, and, gradually, adapted, to, colder, conditions, in, the, arctic, the, modern, walrus, is, mostly, known, from, arctic, regions, but, a, substantial, breeding, population, occurred, on, isolated, sable, island, 100, mi, 160, km, southeast, of, nova, scotia, and, 500, mi, 800, km, due, east, of, portland, maine, until, the, early, colonial, period, abundant, walrus, remains, have, also, been, recovered, from, the, southern, north, sea, dating, to, the, eemian, interglacial, period, when, that, region, would, have, been, submerged, as, it, is, today, unlike, the, intervening, glacial, lowstand, when, the, shallow, north, sea, was, dry, land, fossils, known, from, san, francisco, vancouver, and, the, atlantic, us, coast, as, far, south, as, north, carolina, have, been, referred, to, glacial, periods, an, isolated, population, in, the, laptev, sea, was, considered, by, some, authorities, including, many, russian, biologists, and, the, canonical, mammal, species, of, the, world, to, be, a, third, subspecies, o, r, laptevi, chapskii, 1940, but, has, since, been, determined, to, be, of, pacific, walrus, origin, while, some, outsized, pacific, males, can, weigh, as, much, as, 2, 000, kg, 4, 400, lb, most, weigh, between, 800, and, 1, 700, kg, 1, 800, and, 3, 700, lb, an, occasional, male, of, the, pacific, subspecies, far, exceeds, normal, dimensions, in, 1909, a, walrus, hide, weighing, 500, kg, 1, 100, lb, was, collected, from, an, enormous, bull, in, franz, josef, land, while, in, august, 1910, jack, woodson, shot, a, 4, 9, metre, long, 16, ft, walrus, harvesting, its, 450, kg, 1, 000, lb, hide, since, a, walrus, s, hide, usually, accounts, for, about, 20, of, its, body, weight, the, total, body, mass, of, these, two, giants, is, estimated, to, have, been, at, least, 2, 300, kg, 5, 000, lb, the, atlantic, subspecies, weighs, about, 10, 20, less, than, the, pacific, subspecies, male, atlantic, walrus, weigh, an, average, of, 900, kg, 2, 000, lb, the, atlantic, walrus, also, tends, to, have, relatively, shorter, tusks, and, somewhat, more, of, a, flattened, snout, females, weigh, about, two, thirds, as, much, as, males, with, the, atlantic, females, averaging, 560, kg, 1, 230, lb, sometimes, weighing, as, little, as, 400, kg, 880, lb, and, the, pacific, female, averaging, 800, kg, 1, 800, lb, length, typically, ranges, from, 2, 2, to, 3, 6, m, 7, ft, 3, in, to, 11, ft, 10, in, newborn, walruses, are, already, quite, large, averaging, 33, to, 85, kg, 73, to, 187, lb, in, weight, and, 1, to, 1, 4, m, 3, ft, 3, in, to, 4, ft, 7, in, in, length, across, both, sexes, and, subspecies, all, told, the, walrus, is, the, third, largest, pinniped, species, after, the, two, elephant, seals, walruses, maintain, such, a, high, body, weight, because, of, the, blubber, stored, underneath, their, skin, this, blubber, keeps, them, warm, and, the, fat, provides, energy, to, the, walrus, the, walrus, s, body, shape, shares, features, with, both, sea, lions, eared, seals, otariidae, and, seals, true, seals, phocidae, as, with, otariids, it, can, turn, its, rear, flippers, forward, and, move, on, all, fours, however, its, swimming, technique, is, more, like, that, of, true, seals, relying, less, on, flippers, and, more, on, sinuous, whole, body, movements, also, like, phocids, it, lacks, external, ears, the, extraocular, muscles, of, the, walrus, are, well, developed, this, and, its, lack, of, orbital, roof, allow, it, to, protrude, its, eyes, and, see, in, both, a, frontal, and, dorsal, direction, however, vision, in, this, species, appears, to, be, more, suited, for, short, range, while, this, was, not, true, of, all, extinct, walruses, the, most, prominent, feature, of, the, living, species, is, its, long, tusks, these, are, elongated, canines, which, are, present, in, both, male, and, female, walruses, and, can, reach, a, length, of, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, and, weigh, up, to, 5, 4, kg, 12, lb, tusks, are, slightly, longer, and, thicker, among, males, which, use, them, for, fighting, dominance, and, display, the, strongest, males, with, the, largest, tusks, typically, dominate, social, groups, tusks, are, also, used, to, form, and, maintain, holes, in, the, ice, and, aid, the, walrus, in, climbing, out, of, water, onto, ice, tusks, were, once, thought, to, be, used, to, dig, out, prey, from, the, seabed, but, analyses, of, abrasion, patterns, on, the, tusks, indicate, they, are, dragged, through, the, sediment, while, the, upper, edge, of, the, snout, is, used, for, digging, while, the, dentition, of, walruses, is, highly, variable, they, generally, have, relatively, few, teeth, other, than, the, tusks, the, maximal, number, of, teeth, is, 38, with, dentition, formula, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, but, over, half, of, the, teeth, are, rudimentary, and, occur, with, less, than, 50, frequency, such, that, a, typical, dentition, includes, only, 18, teeth, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, surrounding, the, tusks, is, a, broad, mat, of, stiff, bristles, mystacial, vibrissae, giving, the, walrus, a, characteristic, whiskered, appearance, there, can, be, 400, to, 700, vibrissae, in, 13, to, 15, rows, reaching, 30, cm, 12, in, in, length, though, in, the, wild, they, are, often, worn, to, much, shorter, lengths, due, to, constant, use, in, foraging, the, vibrissae, are, attached, to, muscles, and, are, supplied, with, blood, and, nerves, making, them, highly, sensitive, organs, capable, of, differentiating, shapes, 3, mm, 1, 8, in, thick, and, 2, mm, 3, 32, in, wide, aside, from, the, vibrissae, the, walrus, is, sparsely, covered, with, fur, and, appears, bald, its, skin, is, highly, wrinkled, and, thick, up, to, 10, cm, 4, in, around, the, neck, and, shoulders, of, males, the, blubber, layer, beneath, is, up, to, 15, cm, 6, in, thick, young, walruses, are, deep, brown, and, grow, paler, and, more, cinnamon, colored, as, they, age, old, males, in, particular, become, nearly, pink, because, skin, blood, vessels, constrict, in, cold, water, the, walrus, can, appear, almost, white, when, swimming, as, a, secondary, sexual, characteristic, males, also, acquire, significant, nodules, called, bosses, particularly, around, the, neck, and, shoulders, the, walrus, has, an, air, sac, under, its, throat, which, acts, like, a, flotation, bubble, and, allows, it, to, bob, vertically, in, the, water, and, sleep, the, males, possess, a, large, baculum, penis, bone, up, to, 63, cm, 25, in, in, length, the, largest, of, any, land, mammal, both, in, absolute, size, and, relative, to, body, size, walruses, live, to, about, 20, 30, years, old, in, the, wild, the, males, reach, sexual, maturity, as, early, as, seven, years, but, do, not, typically, mate, until, fully, developed, at, around, 15, years, of, age, they, rut, from, january, through, april, decreasing, their, food, intake, dramatically, the, females, begin, ovulating, as, soon, as, four, to, six, years, old, the, females, are, diestrous, coming, into, heat, in, late, summer, and, around, february, yet, the, males, are, fertile, only, around, february, the, potential, fertility, of, this, second, period, is, unknown, breeding, occurs, from, january, to, march, peaking, in, february, males, aggregate, in, the, water, around, ice, bound, groups, of, estrous, females, and, engage, in, competitive, vocal, displays, the, females, join, them, and, copulate, in, the, water, gestation, lasts, 15, to, 16, months, the, first, three, to, four, months, are, spent, with, the, blastula, in, suspended, development, before, it, implants, itself, in, the, uterus, this, strategy, of, delayed, implantation, common, among, pinnipeds, presumably, evolved, to, optimize, both, the, mating, season, and, the, birthing, season, determined, by, ecological, conditions, that, promote, newborn, survival, calves, are, born, during, the, spring, migration, from, april, to, june, they, weigh, 45, to, 75, kg, 99, to, 165, lb, at, birth, and, are, able, to, swim, the, mothers, nurse, for, over, a, year, before, weaning, but, the, young, can, spend, up, to, five, years, with, the, mothers, walrus, milk, contains, higher, amounts, of, fats, and, protein, compared, to, land, animals, but, lower, compared, to, phocid, seals, this, lower, fat, content, in, turn, causes, a, slower, growth, rate, among, calves, and, a, longer, nursing, investment, for, their, mothers, because, ovulation, is, suppressed, until, the, calf, is, weaned, females, give, birth, at, most, every, two, years, leaving, the, walrus, with, the, lowest, reproductive, rate, of, any, pinniped, the, rest, of, the, year, late, summer, and, fall, walruses, tend, to, form, massive, aggregations, of, tens, of, thousands, of, individuals, on, rocky, beaches, or, outcrops, the, migration, between, the, ice, and, the, beach, can, be, long, distance, and, dramatic, in, late, spring, and, summer, for, example, several, hundred, thousand, pacific, walruses, migrate, from, the, bering, sea, into, the, chukchi, sea, through, the, relatively, narrow, bering, strait, the, majority, of, the, population, of, the, pacific, walrus, spends, its, summers, north, of, the, bering, strait, in, the, chukchi, sea, of, the, arctic, ocean, along, the, northern, coast, of, eastern, siberia, around, wrangel, island, in, the, beaufort, sea, along, the, northern, shore, of, alaska, south, to, unimak, island, and, in, the, waters, between, those, locations, smaller, numbers, of, males, summer, in, the, gulf, of, anadyr, on, the, southern, coast, of, the, siberian, chukchi, peninsula, and, in, bristol, bay, off, the, southern, coast, of, alaska, west, of, the, alaska, peninsula, in, the, spring, and, fall, walruses, congregate, throughout, the, bering, strait, reaching, from, the, western, coast, of, alaska, to, the, gulf, of, anadyr, they, winter, over, in, the, bering, sea, along, the, eastern, coast, of, siberia, south, to, the, northern, part, of, the, kamchatka, peninsula, and, along, the, southern, coast, of, alaska, a, 28, 000, year, old, fossil, walrus, was, dredged, up, from, the, bottom, of, san, francisco, bay, indicating, that, pacific, walruses, ranged, that, far, south, during, the, last, ice, age, commercial, harvesting, reduced, the, population, of, the, pacific, walrus, to, between, 50, 000, and, 100, 000, in, the, 1950s, 1960s, limits, on, commercial, hunting, allowed, the, population, to, increase, to, a, peak, in, the, 1970s, 1980s, but, subsequently, walrus, numbers, have, again, declined, early, aerial, censuses, of, pacific, walrus, conducted, at, five, year, intervals, between, 1975, and, 1985, estimated, populations, of, above, 220, 000, in, each, of, the, three, surveys, in, 2006, the, population, of, the, pacific, walrus, was, estimated, to, be, around, 129, 000, on, the, basis, of, an, aerial, census, combined, with, satellite, tracking, there, were, roughly, 200, 000, pacific, walruses, in, 1990, the, much, smaller, population, of, atlantic, walruses, ranges, from, the, canadian, arctic, across, greenland, svalbard, and, the, western, part, of, arctic, russia, there, are, eight, hypothetical, subpopulations, of, atlantic, walruses, based, largely, on, their, geographical, distribution, and, movements, five, west, of, greenland, and, three, east, of, greenland, the, atlantic, walrus, once, ranged, south, to, sable, island, off, of, nova, scotia, as, late, as, the, 18th, century, they, could, be, found, in, large, numbers, in, the, greater, gulf, of, st, lawrence, region, sometimes, in, colonies, of, 7, 8, 000, individuals, this, population, was, nearly, eradicated, by, commercial, harvest, their, current, numbers, though, difficult, to, estimate, probably, remain, below, 20, 000, in, april, 2006, the, canadian, species, at, risk, act, listed, the, populations, of, northwestern, atlantic, walrus, in, qu, bec, new, brunswick, nova, scotia, newfoundland, and, labrador, as, having, been, eradicated, in, canada, a, genetically, distinct, population, existed, in, iceland, that, was, wiped, out, after, norse, settlement, around, 1213, 1330, ad, an, isolated, population, is, restricted, year, round, to, the, central, and, western, regions, of, the, laptev, sea, from, the, eastern, kara, sea, to, the, westernmost, regions, of, the, east, siberian, sea, the, current, population, of, these, laptev, walruses, has, been, estimated, at, between, 5, 10, 000, even, though, walruses, can, dive, to, depths, beyond, 500, meters, they, spend, most, of, their, time, in, shallow, waters, and, the, nearby, ice, floes, hunting, for, bivalves, in, march, 2021, a, single, walrus, nicknamed, wally, the, walrus, was, sighted, at, valentia, island, ireland, far, south, of, its, typical, range, potentially, due, to, having, fallen, asleep, on, an, iceberg, that, then, drifted, south, towards, ireland, days, later, a, walrus, thought, to, be, the, same, animal, was, spotted, on, the, pembrokeshire, coast, wales, in, june, 2022, a, single, walrus, was, sighted, on, the, shores, of, the, baltic, sea, at, r, gen, island, germany, mielno, poland, and, sk, lder, bay, sweden, in, july, 2022, there, was, a, report, of, a, lost, starving, walrus, nicknamed, as, stena, in, the, coastal, waters, of, the, towns, of, hamina, and, kotka, in, kymenlaakso, finland, that, despite, rescue, attempts, died, of, starvation, when, the, rescuers, tried, to, transport, it, to, the, korkeasaari, zoo, for, treatment, walruses, prefer, shallow, shelf, regions, and, forage, primarily, on, the, sea, floor, often, from, sea, ice, platforms, they, are, not, particularly, deep, divers, compared, to, other, pinnipeds, the, deepest, dives, in, a, study, of, atlantic, walrus, near, svalbard, were, only, 31, 17, m, 102, 56, ft, but, a, more, recent, study, recorded, dives, exceeding, 500, m, 1640, ft, in, smith, sound, between, nw, greenland, and, arctic, canada, in, general, peak, dive, depth, can, be, expected, to, depend, on, prey, distribution, and, seabed, depth, the, walrus, has, a, diverse, and, opportunistic, diet, feeding, on, more, than, 60, genera, of, marine, organisms, including, shrimp, crabs, priapulids, spoon, worms, tube, worms, soft, corals, tunicates, sea, cucumbers, various, mollusks, such, as, snails, octopuses, and, squid, some, types, of, slow, moving, fish, and, even, parts, of, other, pinnipeds, however, it, prefers, benthic, bivalve, mollusks, especially, clams, for, which, it, forages, by, grazing, along, the, sea, bottom, searching, and, identifying, prey, with, its, sensitive, vibrissae, and, clearing, the, murky, bottoms, with, jets, of, water, and, active, flipper, movements, the, walrus, sucks, the, meat, out, by, sealing, its, powerful, lips, to, the, organism, and, withdrawing, its, piston, like, tongue, rapidly, into, its, mouth, creating, a, vacuum, the, walrus, palate, is, uniquely, vaulted, enabling, effective, suction, the, diet, of, the, pacific, walrus, consist, almost, exclusively, of, benthic, invertebrates, 97, percent, aside, from, the, large, numbers, of, organisms, actually, consumed, by, the, walrus, its, foraging, has, a, large, peripheral, impact, on, benthic, communities, it, disturbs, bioturbates, the, sea, floor, releasing, nutrients, into, the, water, column, encouraging, mixing, and, movement, of, many, organisms, and, increasing, the, patchiness, of, the, benthos, seal, tissue, has, been, observed, in, a, fairly, significant, proportion, of, walrus, stomachs, in, the, pacific, but, the, importance, of, seals, in, the, walrus, diet, is, under, debate, there, have, been, isolated, observations, of, walruses, preying, on, seals, up, to, the, size, of, a, 200, kg, 440, lb, bearded, seal, rarely, incidents, of, walruses, preying, on, seabirds, particularly, the, br, nnich, s, guillemot, uria, lomvia, have, been, documented, walruses, may, occasionally, prey, on, ice, entrapped, narwhals, and, scavenge, on, whale, carcasses, but, there, is, little, evidence, to, prove, this, due, to, its, great, size, and, tusks, the, walrus, has, only, two, natural, predators, the, orca, and, the, polar, bear, the, walrus, does, not, however, comprise, a, significant, component, of, either, of, these, predators, diets, both, the, orca, and, the, polar, bear, are, also, most, likely, to, prey, on, walrus, calves, the, polar, bear, often, hunts, the, walrus, by, rushing, at, beached, aggregations, and, consuming, the, individuals, crushed, or, wounded, in, the, sudden, exodus, typically, younger, or, infirm, animals, the, bears, also, isolate, walruses, when, they, overwinter, and, are, unable, to, escape, a, charging, bear, due, to, inaccessible, diving, holes, in, the, ice, however, even, an, injured, walrus, is, a, formidable, opponent, for, a, polar, bear, and, direct, attacks, are, rare, armed, with, its, ivory, tusks, walruses, have, been, known, to, fatally, injure, polar, bears, in, battles, if, the, latter, follows, the, other, into, the, water, where, the, bear, is, at, a, disadvantage, polar, bear, walrus, battles, are, often, extremely, protracted, and, exhausting, and, bears, have, been, known, to, break, away, from, the, attack, after, injuring, a, walrus, orcas, regularly, attack, walruses, although, walruses, are, believed, to, have, successfully, defended, themselves, via, counterattack, against, the, larger, cetacean, however, orcas, have, been, observed, successfully, attacking, walruses, with, few, or, no, injuries, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, walrus, was, heavily, exploited, by, american, and, european, sealers, and, whalers, leading, to, the, near, extirpation, of, the, atlantic, subspecies, as, early, as, 1871, traditional, hunters, were, expressing, concern, about, the, numbers, of, walrus, being, hunted, by, whaling, fleets, commercial, walrus, harvesting, is, now, outlawed, throughout, its, range, although, chukchi, yupik, and, inuit, peoples, are, permitted, to, kill, small, numbers, towards, the, end, of, each, summer, traditional, hunters, used, all, parts, of, the, walrus, the, meat, often, preserved, is, an, important, winter, nutrition, source, the, flippers, are, fermented, and, stored, as, a, delicacy, until, spring, tusks, and, bone, were, historically, used, for, tools, as, well, as, material, for, handicrafts, the, oil, was, rendered, for, warmth, and, light, the, tough, hide, made, rope, and, house, and, boat, coverings, and, the, intestines, and, gut, linings, made, waterproof, parkas, while, some, of, these, uses, have, faded, with, access, to, alternative, technologies, walrus, meat, remains, an, important, part, of, local, diets, and, tusk, carving, and, engraving, remain, a, vital, art, form, according, to, adolf, erik, nordenski, ld, european, hunters, and, arctic, explorers, found, walrus, meat, not, particularly, tasty, and, only, ate, it, in, case, of, necessity, however, walrus, tongue, was, a, delicacy, walrus, hunts, are, regulated, by, resource, managers, in, russia, the, united, states, canada, and, greenland, and, by, representatives, of, the, respective, hunting, communities, an, estimated, four, to, seven, thousand, pacific, walruses, are, harvested, in, alaska, and, in, russia, including, a, significant, portion, about, 42, of, struck, and, lost, animals, several, hundred, are, removed, annually, around, greenland, the, sustainability, of, these, levels, of, harvest, is, difficult, to, determine, given, uncertain, population, estimates, and, parameters, such, as, fecundity, and, mortality, the, boone, and, crockett, big, game, record, book, has, entries, for, atlantic, and, pacific, walrus, the, recorded, largest, tusks, are, just, over, 30, inches, and, 37, inches, long, respectively, the, effects, of, global, climate, change, are, another, element, of, concern, the, extent, and, thickness, of, the, pack, ice, has, reached, unusually, low, levels, in, several, recent, years, the, walrus, relies, on, this, ice, while, giving, birth, and, aggregating, in, the, reproductive, period, thinner, pack, ice, over, the, bering, sea, has, reduced, the, amount, of, resting, habitat, near, optimal, feeding, grounds, this, more, widely, separates, lactating, females, from, their, calves, increasing, nutritional, stress, for, the, young, and, lower, reproductive, rates, reduced, coastal, sea, ice, has, also, been, implicated, in, the, increase, of, stampeding, deaths, crowding, the, shorelines, of, the, chukchi, sea, between, eastern, russia, and, western, alaska, analysis, of, trends, in, ice, cover, published, in, 2012, indicate, that, pacific, walrus, populations, are, likely, to, continue, to, decline, for, the, foreseeable, future, and, shift, further, north, but, that, careful, conservation, management, might, be, able, to, limit, these, effects, currently, two, of, the, three, walrus, subspecies, are, listed, as, least, concern, by, the, iucn, while, the, third, is, data, deficient, the, pacific, walrus, is, not, listed, as, depleted, according, to, the, marine, mammal, protection, act, nor, as, threatened, or, endangered, under, the, endangered, species, act, the, russian, atlantic, and, laptev, sea, populations, are, classified, as, category, 2, decreasing, and, category, 3, rare, in, the, russian, red, book, global, trade, in, walrus, ivory, is, restricted, according, to, a, cites, appendix, 3, listing, in, october, 2017, the, center, for, biological, diversity, announced, they, would, sue, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, to, force, it, to, classify, the, pacific, walrus, as, a, threatened, or, endangered, species, in, 1952, walruses, in, svalbard, were, nearly, gone, due, to, ivory, hunting, over, a, 300, years, period, but, the, norwegian, government, banned, their, commercial, hunting, and, the, walruses, began, to, repopulate, by, 2018, the, population, had, increased, to, an, estimated, 5, 503, walruses, in, the, svalbard, area, the, walrus, plays, an, important, role, in, the, religion, and, folklore, of, many, arctic, peoples, skin, and, bone, are, used, in, some, ceremonies, and, the, animal, appears, frequently, in, legends, for, example, in, a, chukchi, version, of, the, widespread, myth, of, the, raven, in, which, raven, recovers, the, sun, and, the, moon, from, an, evil, spirit, by, seducing, his, daughter, the, angry, father, throws, the, daughter, from, a, high, cliff, and, as, she, drops, into, the, water, she, turns, into, a, walrus, according, to, various, legends, the, tusks, are, formed, either, by, the, trails, of, mucus, from, the, weeping, girl, or, her, long, braids, this, myth, is, possibly, related, to, the, chukchi, myth, of, the, old, walrus, headed, woman, who, rules, the, bottom, of, the, sea, who, is, in, turn, linked, to, the, inuit, goddess, sedna, both, in, chukotka, and, alaska, the, aurora, borealis, is, believed, to, be, a, special, world, inhabited, by, those, who, died, by, violence, the, changing, rays, representing, deceased, souls, playing, ball, with, a, walrus, head, most, of, the, distinctive, 12th, century, lewis, chessmen, from, northern, europe, are, carved, from, walrus, ivory, though, a, few, have, been, found, to, be, made, of, whales, teeth, because, of, its, distinctive, appearance, great, bulk, and, immediately, recognizable, whiskers, and, tusks, the, walrus, also, appears, in, the, popular, cultures, of, peoples, with, little, direct, experience, with, the, animal, particularly, in, english, children, s, literature, perhaps, its, best, known, appearance, is, in, lewis, carroll, s, whimsical, poem, the, walrus, and, the, carpenter, that, appears, in, his, 1871, book, through, the, looking, glass, in, the, poem, the, eponymous, antiheroes, use, trickery, to, consume, a, great, number, of, oysters, although, carroll, accurately, portrays, the, biological, walrus, s, appetite, for, bivalve, mollusks, oysters, primarily, nearshore, and, intertidal, inhabitants, these, organisms, in, fact, comprise, an, insignificant, portion, of, its, diet, in, captivity, the, walrus, in, the, cryptic, song, i, am, the, walrus, by, the, beatles, is, a, reference, to, the, lewis, carroll, poem, another, appearance, of, the, walrus, in, literature, is, in, the, story, the, white, seal, in, rudyard, kipling, s, the, jungle, book, where, it, is, the, old, sea, vitch, the, big, ugly, bloated, pimpled, fat, necked, long, tusked, walrus, of, the, north, pacific, who, has, no, manners, except, when, he, is, asleep
