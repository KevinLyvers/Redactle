the, tomato, t, m, e, t, o, or, t, m, t, o, is, the, edible, berry, of, the, plant, solanum, lycopersicum, commonly, known, as, the, tomato, plant, the, species, originated, in, western, south, america, mexico, and, central, america, its, domestication, and, use, as, a, cultivated, food, may, have, originated, with, the, indigenous, peoples, of, mexico, the, aztecs, used, tomatoes, in, their, cooking, at, the, time, of, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, and, after, the, spanish, encountered, the, tomato, for, the, first, time, after, their, contact, with, the, aztecs, they, brought, the, plant, to, europe, in, a, widespread, cultural, interchange, known, as, the, columbian, exchange, from, there, the, tomato, was, introduced, to, other, parts, of, the, european, colonized, world, during, the, 16th, century, tomatoes, are, a, significant, source, of, umami, flavor, they, are, consumed, in, diverse, ways, raw, or, cooked, and, in, many, dishes, sauces, salads, and, drinks, while, tomatoes, are, fruits, botanically, classified, as, berries, they, are, commonly, used, culinarily, as, a, vegetable, ingredient, or, side, dish, numerous, varieties, of, the, tomato, plant, are, widely, grown, in, temperate, climates, across, the, world, with, greenhouses, allowing, for, the, production, of, tomatoes, throughout, all, seasons, of, the, year, tomato, plants, typically, grow, to, 1, 3, meters, 3, 10, ft, in, height, they, are, vines, that, have, a, weak, stem, that, sprawls, and, typically, needs, support, indeterminate, tomato, plants, are, perennials, in, their, native, habitat, but, are, cultivated, as, annuals, determinate, or, bush, plants, are, annuals, that, stop, growing, at, a, certain, height, and, produce, a, crop, all, at, once, the, size, of, the, tomato, varies, according, to, the, cultivar, with, a, range, of, 1, 10, cm, 1, 2, 4, in, in, width, the, wild, ancestor, of, the, tomato, solanum, pimpinellifolium, is, native, to, western, south, america, these, wild, versions, were, the, size, of, peas, the, first, evidence, of, domestication, points, to, the, aztecs, and, other, peoples, in, mesoamerica, who, used, the, fruit, fresh, and, in, their, cooking, the, spanish, first, introduced, tomatoes, to, europe, where, they, became, used, in, spanish, food, in, france, italy, and, northern, europe, the, tomato, was, initially, grown, as, an, ornamental, plant, it, was, regarded, with, suspicion, as, a, food, because, botanists, recognized, it, as, a, nightshade, a, relative, of, the, poisonous, belladonna, this, was, exacerbated, by, the, interaction, of, the, tomato, s, acidic, juice, with, pewter, plates, the, leaves, and, fruit, contain, tomatine, which, in, large, quantities, would, be, toxic, however, the, ripe, fruit, contains, a, much, lower, amount, of, tomatine, than, the, immature, fruit, the, exact, date, of, domestication, is, unknown, by, 500, bc, it, was, already, being, cultivated, in, southern, mexico, and, probably, other, areas, 13, the, pueblo, people, are, thought, to, have, believed, that, those, who, witnessed, the, ingestion, of, tomato, seeds, were, blessed, with, powers, of, divination, the, large, lumpy, variety, of, tomato, a, mutation, from, a, smoother, smaller, fruit, originated, in, mesoamerica, and, may, be, the, direct, ancestor, of, some, modern, cultivated, tomatoes, 15, the, aztecs, raised, several, varieties, of, tomato, with, red, tomatoes, called, xitomatl, and, green, tomatoes, physalis, called, tomatl, tomatillo, bernardino, de, sahag, n, reported, seeing, a, great, variety, of, tomatoes, in, the, aztec, market, at, tenochtitl, n, mexico, city, large, tomatoes, small, tomatoes, leaf, tomatoes, sweet, tomatoes, large, serpent, tomatoes, nipple, shaped, tomatoes, and, tomatoes, of, all, colors, from, the, brightest, red, to, the, deepest, yellow, bernardino, de, sahag, n, mentioned, aztecs, cooking, various, sauces, some, with, and, without, tomatoes, of, different, sizes, serving, them, in, city, markets, foods, sauces, hot, sauces, fried, olla, cooked, juices, sauces, of, juices, shredded, with, chile, with, squash, seeds, with, tomatoes, with, smoked, chile, with, hot, chile, with, yellow, chile, with, mild, red, chile, sauce, yellow, chile, sauce, hot, chile, sauce, with, bird, excrement, sauce, sauce, of, smoked, chile, heated, bean, sauce, toasted, beans, cooked, beans, mushroom, sauce, sauce, of, small, squash, sauce, of, large, tomatoes, sauce, of, ordinary, tomatoes, sauce, of, various, kinds, of, sour, herbs, avocado, sauce, spanish, conquistador, hern, n, cort, s, may, have, been, the, first, to, transfer, a, small, yellow, tomato, to, europe, after, he, captured, the, aztec, city, of, tenochtitlan, now, mexico, city, in, 1521, the, earliest, discussion, of, the, tomato, in, european, literature, appeared, in, a, herbal, written, in, 1544, by, pietro, andrea, mattioli, an, italian, physician, and, botanist, who, suggested, that, a, new, type, of, eggplant, had, been, brought, to, italy, that, was, blood, red, or, golden, color, when, mature, and, could, be, divided, into, segments, and, eaten, like, an, eggplant, that, is, cooked, and, seasoned, with, salt, black, pepper, and, oil, it, was, not, until, ten, years, later, that, tomatoes, were, named, in, print, by, mattioli, as, pomi, d, oro, or, golden, apples, 13, after, the, spanish, colonization, of, the, americas, the, spanish, distributed, the, tomato, throughout, their, colonies, in, the, caribbean, they, also, took, it, to, the, philippines, from, where, it, spread, to, southeast, asia, and, then, the, entire, asian, continent, the, spanish, also, brought, the, tomato, to, europe, it, grew, easily, in, mediterranean, climates, and, cultivation, began, in, the, 1540s, it, was, probably, eaten, shortly, after, it, was, introduced, and, was, certainly, being, used, as, food, by, the, early, 17th, century, in, spain, the, tomato, was, introduced, to, china, likely, via, the, philippines, or, macau, in, the, 1500s, it, was, given, the, name, f, nqi, foreign, eggplant, as, the, chinese, named, many, foodstuffs, introduced, from, abroad, but, referring, specifically, to, early, introductions, the, recorded, history, of, tomatoes, in, italy, dates, back, to, at, least, 31, october, 1548, when, the, house, steward, of, cosimo, de, medici, the, grand, duke, of, tuscany, wrote, to, the, medici, private, secretary, informing, him, that, the, basket, of, tomatoes, sent, from, the, grand, duke, s, florentine, estate, at, torre, del, gallo, had, arrived, safely, tomatoes, were, grown, mainly, as, ornamentals, early, on, after, their, arrival, in, italy, for, example, the, florentine, aristocrat, giovanvettorio, soderini, wrote, how, they, were, to, be, sought, only, for, their, beauty, and, were, grown, only, in, gardens, or, flower, beds, the, tomato, s, ability, to, mutate, and, create, new, and, different, varieties, helped, contribute, to, its, success, and, spread, throughout, italy, however, in, areas, where, the, climate, supported, growing, tomatoes, their, habit, of, growing, to, the, ground, suggested, low, status, they, were, not, adopted, as, a, staple, of, the, peasant, population, because, they, were, not, as, filling, as, other, fruits, already, available, additionally, both, toxic, and, inedible, varieties, discouraged, many, people, from, attempting, to, consume, or, prepare, any, other, varieties, in, certain, areas, of, italy, such, as, florence, the, fruit, was, used, solely, as, a, tabletop, decoration, until, it, was, incorporated, into, the, local, cuisine, in, the, late, 17th, or, early, 18th, century, the, earliest, discovered, cookbook, with, tomato, recipes, was, published, in, naples, in, 1692, though, the, author, had, apparently, obtained, these, recipes, from, spanish, sources, 17, unique, varieties, were, developed, over, the, next, several, hundred, years, for, uses, such, as, dried, tomatoes, sauce, tomatoes, pizza, tomatoes, and, tomatoes, for, long, term, storage, these, varieties, are, usually, known, for, their, place, of, origin, as, much, as, by, a, variety, name, for, example, there, is, the, pomodorino, del, piennolo, del, vesuvio, the, hanging, tomato, of, vesuvius, or, the, well, known, and, highly, prized, san, marzano, plum, tomato, grown, in, that, region, tomatoes, were, not, grown, in, england, until, the, 1590s, one, of, the, earliest, cultivators, was, john, gerard, a, barber, surgeon, gerard, s, herbal, published, in, 1597, and, largely, plagiarized, from, continental, sources, is, also, one, of, the, earliest, discussions, of, the, tomato, in, england, gerard, knew, the, tomato, was, eaten, in, spain, and, italy, nonetheless, he, believed, it, was, poisonous, in, fact, the, plant, and, raw, fruit, do, have, low, levels, of, tomatine, but, are, not, generally, dangerous, see, below, gerard, s, views, were, influential, and, the, tomato, was, considered, unfit, for, eating, though, not, necessarily, poisonous, for, many, years, in, britain, and, its, north, american, colonies, 17, however, by, the, mid, 18th, century, tomatoes, were, widely, eaten, in, britain, and, before, the, end, of, that, century, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, stated, the, tomato, was, in, daily, use, in, soups, broths, and, as, a, garnish, they, were, not, part, of, the, average, person, s, diet, and, though, by, 1820, they, were, described, as, to, be, seen, in, great, abundance, in, all, our, vegetable, markets, and, to, be, used, by, all, our, best, cooks, reference, was, made, to, their, cultivation, in, gardens, still, for, the, singularity, of, their, appearance, while, their, use, in, cooking, was, associated, with, exotic, italian, or, jewish, cuisine, for, example, in, elizabeth, blackwell, s, a, curious, herbal, it, is, described, under, the, name, love, apple, amoris, pomum, as, being, consumed, with, oil, and, vinegar, in, italy, similar, to, consumption, of, cucumbers, in, the, uk, the, tomato, was, introduced, to, cultivation, in, the, middle, east, by, john, barker, british, consul, in, aleppo, c, 1799, to, 1825, nineteenth, century, descriptions, of, its, consumption, are, uniformly, as, an, ingredient, in, a, cooked, dish, in, 1881, it, is, described, as, only, eaten, in, the, region, within, the, last, forty, years, today, the, tomato, is, a, crucial, and, ubiquitous, part, of, middle, eastern, cuisine, served, fresh, in, salads, e, g, arab, salad, israeli, salad, shirazi, salad, and, turkish, salad, grilled, with, kebabs, and, other, dishes, made, into, sauces, and, so, on, the, earliest, reference, to, tomatoes, being, grown, in, british, north, america, is, from, 1710, when, herbalist, william, salmon, reported, seeing, them, in, what, is, today, south, carolina, 25, they, may, have, been, introduced, from, the, caribbean, by, the, mid, 18th, century, they, were, cultivated, on, some, carolina, plantations, and, probably, in, other, parts, of, the, southeast, as, well, thomas, jefferson, who, ate, tomatoes, in, paris, sent, some, seeds, back, to, america, 28, some, early, american, advocates, of, the, culinary, use, of, the, tomato, included, michele, felice, corn, and, robert, gibbon, johnson, many, americans, considered, tomatoes, to, be, poisonous, at, this, time, and, in, general, they, were, grown, more, as, ornamental, plants, than, as, food, in, 1897, w, h, garrison, addressed, the, medico, legal, society, of, new, york, stating, the, belief, was, once, transmitted, that, the, tomato, was, sinisterly, dangerous, he, recalled, in, his, youth, tomatoes, were, dubbed, love, apples, or, wolf, apples, and, they, were, shunned, as, globes, of, the, devil, alexander, w, livingston, receives, much, credit, for, developing, numerous, varieties, of, tomato, for, both, home, and, commercial, gardeners, early, tomato, breeders, included, henry, tilden, in, iowa, and, a, dr, hand, in, baltimore, the, u, s, department, of, agriculture, s, 1937, yearbook, declared, that, half, of, the, major, varieties, were, a, result, of, the, abilities, of, the, livingstons, to, evaluate, and, perpetuate, superior, material, in, the, tomato, livingston, s, first, breed, of, tomato, the, paragon, was, introduced, in, 1870, the, beginning, of, a, great, tomato, culture, enterprise, in, the, county, in, 1875, he, introduced, the, acme, which, was, said, to, be, involved, in, the, parentage, of, most, of, the, tomatoes, introduced, by, him, and, his, competitors, for, the, next, twenty, five, years, when, livingston, began, his, attempts, to, develop, the, tomato, as, a, commercial, crop, his, aim, had, been, to, grow, tomatoes, smooth, in, contour, uniform, in, size, and, sweet, in, flavor, he, eventually, developed, over, seventeen, different, varieties, of, the, tomato, plant, today, the, crop, is, grown, in, every, state, in, the, union, because, of, the, long, growing, season, needed, for, this, heat, loving, crop, several, states, in, the, us, sun, belt, became, major, tomato, producers, particularly, florida, and, california, in, california, tomatoes, are, grown, under, irrigation, for, both, the, fresh, fruit, market, and, for, canning, and, processing, the, university, of, california, davis, uc, davis, became, a, major, center, for, research, on, the, tomato, the, c, m, rick, tomato, genetics, resource, center, at, uc, davis, is, a, gene, bank, of, wild, relatives, monogenic, mutants, and, miscellaneous, genetic, stocks, of, tomato, the, center, is, named, for, the, late, dr, charles, m, rick, a, pioneer, in, tomato, genetics, research, research, on, processing, tomatoes, is, also, conducted, by, the, california, tomato, research, institute, in, escalon, california, in, california, growers, have, used, a, method, of, cultivation, called, dry, farming, especially, with, early, girl, tomatoes, this, technique, encourages, the, plant, to, send, roots, deep, to, find, existing, moisture, in, soil, that, retains, moisture, such, as, clayey, soil, the, poor, taste, and, lack, of, sugar, in, modern, garden, and, commercial, tomato, varieties, resulted, from, breeding, tomatoes, to, ripen, uniformly, red, this, change, occurred, after, discovery, of, a, mutant, u, phenotype, in, the, mid, 20th, century, so, named, because, the, fruits, ripened, uniformly, this, was, widely, cross, bred, to, produce, red, fruit, without, the, typical, green, ring, around, the, stem, on, un, crossbred, varieties, prior, to, general, introduction, of, this, trait, most, tomatoes, produced, more, sugar, during, ripening, and, were, sweeter, and, more, flavorful, evidence, has, been, found, that, 10, 20, of, the, total, carbon, fixed, in, the, fruit, can, be, produced, by, photosynthesis, in, the, developing, fruit, of, the, normal, u, phenotype, the, u, genetic, mutation, encodes, a, factor, that, produces, defective, chloroplasts, with, lower, density, in, developing, fruit, resulting, in, a, lighter, green, colour, of, unripe, fruit, and, repression, of, sugars, accumulation, in, the, resulting, ripe, fruit, by, 10, 15, perhaps, more, important, than, their, role, in, photosynthesis, the, fruit, chloroplasts, are, remodelled, during, ripening, into, chlorophyll, free, chromoplasts, that, synthesize, and, accumulate, the, carotenoids, lycopene, carotene, and, other, metabolites, that, are, sensory, and, nutritional, assets, of, the, ripe, fruit, the, potent, chloroplasts, in, the, dark, green, shoulders, of, the, u, phenotype, are, beneficial, here, but, have, the, disadvantage, of, leaving, green, shoulders, near, the, stems, of, the, ripe, fruit, and, even, cracked, yellow, shoulders, apparently, because, of, oxidative, stress, due, to, overload, of, the, photosynthetic, chain, in, direct, sunlight, at, high, temperatures, hence, genetic, design, of, a, commercial, variety, that, combines, the, advantages, of, types, u, and, u, requires, fine, tuning, but, may, be, feasible, furthermore, breeders, of, modern, tomato, cultivars, typically, strive, to, produce, tomato, plants, exhibiting, improved, yield, shelf, life, size, and, tolerance, resistance, to, various, environmental, pressures, including, disease, however, these, breeding, efforts, have, yielded, unintended, negative, consequences, on, various, tomato, fruit, attributes, for, instance, linkage, drag, is, a, phenomenon, that, has, been, responsible, for, alterations, in, the, metabolism, of, the, tomato, fruit, linkage, drag, describes, the, introduction, of, an, undesired, trait, or, allele, into, a, plant, during, backcrossing, this, trait, allele, is, physically, linked, or, is, very, close, to, the, desired, allele, along, the, chromosome, in, introducing, the, beneficial, allele, there, exists, a, high, likelihood, that, the, poor, allele, is, also, incorporated, into, the, plant, thus, breeding, efforts, attempting, to, enhance, certain, traits, for, example, larger, fruit, size, have, unintentionally, altered, production, of, chemicals, associated, with, for, instance, nutritional, value, and, flavor, breeders, have, turned, to, using, wild, tomato, species, as, a, source, of, alleles, for, the, introduction, of, beneficial, traits, into, modern, tomato, varieties, for, example, wild, tomato, relatives, may, possess, higher, amounts, of, fruit, solids, which, are, associated, with, greater, sugar, content, or, resistance, to, diseases, caused, by, microbes, such, as, resistance, towards, the, early, blight, pathogen, alternaria, solani, however, this, tactic, has, limitations, for, the, incorporation, of, certain, traits, such, as, pathogen, resistance, can, negatively, impact, other, favorable, phenotypes, such, as, fruit, production, the, word, tomato, comes, from, the, spanish, tomate, which, in, turn, comes, from, the, nahuatl, word, tomatl, pronunciation, meaning, swelling, fruit, the, specific, name, lycopersicum, meaning, wolf, peach, originated, with, galen, who, used, it, to, denote, a, plant, that, has, not, been, identified, luigi, anguillara, speculated, in, the, 16th, century, that, galen, s, lycopersicum, might, be, the, tomato, and, despite, the, impossibility, of, this, identification, lyocpersicum, entered, scientific, use, as, a, name, for, the, fruit, the, usual, pronunciations, of, tomato, are, t, m, e, t, o, t, may, toh, usual, in, north, american, english, and, t, m, t, o, t, mah, toh, usual, in, british, english, the, word, s, dual, pronunciations, were, immortalized, in, ira, and, george, gershwin, s, 1937, song, let, s, call, the, whole, thing, off, you, like, p, t, e, t, o, and, i, like, p, t, t, o, you, like, t, m, e, t, o, and, i, like, t, m, t, o, and, have, become, a, symbol, for, nitpicking, pronunciation, disputes, in, this, capacity, it, has, even, become, an, american, and, british, slang, term, saying, t, m, e, t, o, t, m, t, o, when, presented, with, two, choices, can, mean, what, s, the, difference, or, it, s, all, the, same, to, me, tomato, plants, are, vines, initially, decumbent, and, could, grow, up, to, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, although, erect, bush, varieties, have, been, bred, generally, 100, cm, 3, ft, 3, in, tall, or, shorter, indeterminate, types, are, tender, perennials, dying, annually, in, temperate, climates, they, are, originally, native, to, tropical, highlands, although, they, can, live, up, to, three, years, in, a, greenhouse, in, some, cases, determinate, types, are, annual, in, all, climates, tomato, plants, are, dicots, and, grow, as, a, series, of, branching, stems, with, a, terminal, bud, at, the, tip, that, does, the, actual, growing, when, the, tip, eventually, stops, growing, whether, because, of, pruning, or, flowering, lateral, buds, take, over, and, grow, into, other, fully, functional, vines, tomato, vines, are, typically, pubescent, meaning, covered, with, fine, short, hairs, the, hairs, facilitate, the, vining, process, turning, into, roots, wherever, the, plant, is, in, contact, with, the, ground, and, moisture, especially, if, the, vine, s, connection, to, its, original, root, has, been, damaged, or, severed, most, tomato, plants, have, compound, leaves, and, are, called, regular, leaf, rl, plants, but, some, cultivars, have, simple, leaves, known, as, potato, leaf, pl, style, because, of, their, resemblance, to, that, particular, relative, of, rl, plants, there, are, variations, such, as, rugose, leaves, which, are, deeply, grooved, and, variegated, angora, leaves, which, have, additional, colors, where, a, genetic, mutation, causes, chlorophyll, to, be, excluded, from, some, portions, of, the, leaves, the, leaves, are, 10, 25, cm, 4, 10, in, long, odd, pinnate, with, five, to, nine, leaflets, on, petioles, each, leaflet, up, to, 8, cm, 3, in, long, with, a, serrated, margin, both, the, stem, and, leaves, are, densely, glandular, hairy, their, flowers, appearing, on, the, apical, meristem, have, the, anthers, fused, along, the, edges, forming, a, column, surrounding, the, pistil, s, style, flowers, are, bisexual, and, able, to, self, fertilise, the, anthers, bend, into, a, cone, like, structure, surrounding, the, stigma, the, flowers, are, 1, 2, cm, 1, 2, 3, 4, in, across, yellow, with, five, pointed, lobes, on, the, corolla, they, are, borne, in, a, cyme, of, three, to, twelve, together, although, in, culinary, terms, tomato, is, regarded, as, a, vegetable, its, fruit, is, classified, botanically, as, a, berry, as, a, true, fruit, it, develops, from, the, ovary, of, the, plant, after, fertilization, its, flesh, comprising, the, pericarp, walls, the, fruit, contains, hollow, spaces, full, of, seeds, and, moisture, called, locular, cavities, these, vary, among, cultivated, species, according, to, type, some, smaller, varieties, have, two, cavities, globe, shaped, varieties, typically, have, three, to, five, beefsteak, tomatoes, have, a, great, number, of, smaller, cavities, while, paste, tomatoes, have, very, few, very, small, cavities, for, propagation, the, seeds, need, to, come, from, a, mature, fruit, and, must, be, lightly, fermented, to, remove, the, gelatinous, outer, coating, and, then, dried, before, use, in, 1753, linnaeus, placed, the, tomato, in, the, genus, solanum, alongside, the, potato, as, solanum, lycopersicum, in, 1768, philip, miller, moved, it, to, its, own, genus, naming, it, lycopersicon, esculentum, the, name, came, into, wide, use, but, was, technically, in, breach, of, the, plant, naming, rules, because, linnaeus, s, species, name, lycopersicum, still, had, priority, although, the, name, lycopersicum, lycopersicum, was, suggested, by, karsten, 1888, it, is, not, used, because, it, violates, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, barring, the, use, of, tautonyms, in, botanical, nomenclature, the, corrected, name, lycopersicon, lycopersicum, nicolson, 1974, was, technically, valid, because, miller, s, genus, name, and, linnaeus, s, species, name, differ, in, exact, spelling, but, since, lycopersicon, esculentum, has, become, so, well, known, it, was, officially, listed, as, a, nomen, conservandum, in, 1983, and, would, be, the, correct, name, for, the, tomato, in, classifications, which, do, not, place, the, tomato, in, the, genus, solanum, genetic, evidence, has, now, shown, that, linnaeus, was, correct, to, put, the, tomato, in, the, genus, solanum, making, solanum, lycopersicum, the, correct, name, both, names, however, will, probably, be, found, in, the, literature, for, some, time, two, of, the, major, reasons, for, considering, the, genera, separate, are, the, leaf, structure, tomato, leaves, are, markedly, different, from, any, other, solanum, and, the, biochemistry, many, of, the, alkaloids, common, to, other, solanum, species, are, conspicuously, absent, from, the, tomato, on, the, other, hand, hybrids, of, tomato, and, diploid, potato, can, be, created, in, the, lab, by, somatic, fusion, and, are, partially, fertile, providing, evidence, of, the, close, relationship, between, these, species, an, international, consortium, of, researchers, from, 10, countries, began, sequencing, the, tomato, genome, in, 2004, a, prerelease, version, of, the, genome, was, made, available, in, december, 2009, the, complete, genome, for, the, cultivar, heinz, 1706, was, published, on, 31, may, 2012, in, nature, the, latest, reference, genome, published, in, 2021, had, 799, mb, and, encodes, 34, 384, predicted, proteins, spread, over, 12, chromosomes, since, many, other, fruits, like, strawberries, apples, melons, and, bananas, share, the, same, characteristics, and, genes, researchers, stated, the, published, genome, could, help, to, improve, food, quality, food, security, and, reduce, costs, of, all, of, these, fruits, the, first, commercially, available, genetically, modified, food, was, a, tomato, called, flavr, savr, which, was, engineered, to, have, a, longer, shelf, life, however, it, is, no, longer, commercially, available, scientists, are, continuing, to, develop, tomatoes, with, new, traits, not, found, in, natural, crops, such, as, increased, resistance, to, pests, or, environmental, stresses, or, better, flavor, the, tomato, genetic, resource, center, germplasm, resources, information, network, avrdc, and, numerous, seed, banks, around, the, world, store, seed, representing, genetic, variations, of, value, to, modern, agriculture, these, seed, stocks, are, available, for, legitimate, breeding, and, research, efforts, while, individual, breeding, efforts, can, produce, useful, results, the, bulk, of, tomato, breeding, work, is, at, universities, and, major, agriculture, related, corporations, these, efforts, have, resulted, in, significant, regionally, adapted, breeding, lines, and, hybrids, such, as, the, mountain, series, from, north, carolina, corporations, including, heinz, monsanto, bhnseed, and, bejoseed, have, breeding, programs, that, attempt, to, improve, production, size, shape, color, flavor, disease, tolerance, pest, tolerance, nutritional, value, and, numerous, other, traits, botanically, a, tomato, is, a, fruit, a, berry, consisting, of, the, ovary, together, with, its, seeds, of, a, flowering, plant, however, the, tomato, is, considered, a, culinary, vegetable, because, it, has, a, much, lower, sugar, content, than, culinary, fruits, because, it, is, more, savoury, umami, than, sweet, it, is, typically, served, as, part, of, a, salad, or, main, course, of, a, meal, rather, than, as, a, dessert, tomatoes, are, not, the, only, food, source, with, this, ambiguity, bell, peppers, cucumbers, green, beans, aubergines, eggplants, avocados, and, squashes, of, all, kinds, such, as, courgettes, zucchini, and, pumpkins, are, all, botanically, fruit, yet, cooked, as, vegetables, the, confusion, on, whether, tomatoes, are, fruits, or, vegetables, has, led, to, legal, dispute, in, the, united, states, in, 1887, u, s, tariff, laws, that, imposed, a, duty, on, vegetables, but, not, on, fruit, caused, the, tomato, s, status, to, become, a, matter, of, legal, importance, in, nix, v, hedden, the, u, s, supreme, court, settled, the, tariff, controversy, on, 10, may, 1893, by, declaring, that, the, tomato, is, a, vegetable, based, on, the, popular, definition, that, classifies, vegetables, by, use, they, are, generally, served, with, dinner, and, not, dessert, the, holding, of, this, case, applies, only, to, the, interpretation, of, the, tariff, of, 1883, and, the, court, did, not, purport, to, reclassify, the, tomato, for, botanical, or, other, purposes, the, tomato, is, grown, worldwide, for, its, edible, fruits, with, thousands, of, cultivars, a, fertilizer, with, an, npk, ratio, of, 5, 10, 10, is, often, sold, as, tomato, fertilizer, or, vegetable, fertilizer, although, manure, and, compost, are, also, used, on, average, there, are, 150, 000, seeds, in, a, pound, of, tomato, seeds, tomato, cultivars, vary, widely, in, their, resistance, to, disease, modern, hybrids, focus, on, improving, disease, resistance, over, the, heirloom, plants, various, forms, of, mildew, and, blight, are, common, tomato, afflictions, which, is, why, tomato, cultivars, are, often, marked, with, a, combination, of, letters, that, refer, to, specific, disease, resistance, the, most, common, letters, are, a, common, tomato, disease, is, tobacco, mosaic, virus, handling, cigarettes, and, other, infected, tobacco, products, can, transmit, the, virus, to, tomato, plants, another, particularly, dreaded, disease, is, curly, top, carried, by, the, beet, leafhopper, which, interrupts, the, lifecycle, as, the, name, implies, it, has, the, symptom, of, making, the, top, leaves, of, the, plant, wrinkle, up, and, grow, abnormally, bacterial, wilt, is, another, common, disease, impacting, yield, wang, et, al, 2019, found, phage, combination, therapies, to, reduce, the, impact, of, bacterial, wilt, sometimes, by, reducing, bacterial, abundance, and, sometimes, by, selecting, for, resistant, but, slow, growing, genetics, some, common, tomato, pests, are, the, tomato, bug, stink, bugs, cutworms, tomato, hornworms, and, tobacco, hornworms, aphids, cabbage, loopers, whiteflies, tomato, fruitworms, flea, beetles, red, spider, mite, slugs, and, colorado, potato, beetles, the, tomato, russet, mite, aculops, lycopersici, feeds, on, foliage, and, young, fruit, of, tomato, plants, causing, shrivelling, and, necrosis, of, leaves, flowers, and, fruit, possibly, killing, the, plant, after, an, insect, attack, tomato, plants, produce, systemin, a, plant, peptide, hormone, systemin, activates, defensive, mechanisms, such, as, the, production, of, protease, inhibitors, to, slow, the, growth, of, insects, the, hormone, was, first, identified, in, tomatoes, but, similar, proteins, have, been, identified, in, other, species, since, although, not, a, disease, as, such, irregular, supplies, of, water, can, cause, growing, or, ripening, fruit, to, split, besides, cosmetic, damage, the, splits, may, allow, decay, to, start, although, growing, fruits, have, some, ability, to, heal, after, a, split, in, addition, a, deformity, called, cat, facing, can, be, caused, by, pests, temperature, stress, or, poor, soil, conditions, affected, fruit, usually, remains, edible, but, its, appearance, may, be, unsightly, tomatoes, serve, or, are, served, by, a, large, variety, of, companion, plants, the, devastating, tomato, hornworm, has, a, major, predator, in, various, parasitic, wasps, whose, larvae, devour, the, hornworm, but, whose, adult, form, drinks, nectar, from, tiny, flowered, plants, like, umbellifers, several, species, of, umbellifer, are, therefore, often, grown, with, tomato, plants, including, parsley, queen, anne, s, lace, and, occasionally, dill, these, also, attract, predatory, flies, that, attack, various, tomato, pests, borage, is, thought, to, repel, the, tomato, hornworm, moth, basil, is, popularly, recommended, as, a, companion, plant, to, the, tomato, common, claims, are, that, basil, may, deter, pests, or, improve, tomato, flavor, however, in, double, blind, taste, tests, basil, did, not, significantly, affect, the, taste, of, tomatoes, when, planted, adjacent, to, them, tomato, plants, can, protect, asparagus, from, asparagus, beetles, because, they, contain, solanine, that, kills, this, pest, while, asparagus, plants, contain, asparagusic, acid, that, repels, nematodes, known, to, attack, tomato, plants, marigolds, also, repel, nematodes, in, the, wild, original, state, tomatoes, required, cross, pollination, they, were, much, more, self, incompatible, than, domestic, cultivars, as, a, floral, device, to, reduce, selfing, the, pistil, of, wild, tomatoes, extends, farther, out, of, the, flower, than, today, s, cultivars, the, stamens, were, and, remain, entirely, within, the, closed, corolla, as, tomatoes, were, moved, from, their, native, areas, their, traditional, pollinators, probably, a, species, of, halictid, bee, did, not, move, with, them, the, trait, of, self, fertility, became, an, advantage, and, domestic, cultivars, of, tomato, have, been, selected, to, maximize, this, trait, this, is, not, the, same, as, self, pollination, despite, the, common, claim, that, tomatoes, do, so, that, tomatoes, pollinate, themselves, poorly, without, outside, aid, is, clearly, shown, in, greenhouse, situations, where, pollination, must, be, aided, by, artificial, wind, vibration, of, the, plants, one, brand, of, vibrator, is, a, wand, called, an, electric, bee, that, is, used, manually, or, more, often, today, by, cultured, bumblebees, the, anther, of, a, tomato, flower, is, shaped, like, a, hollow, tube, with, the, pollen, produced, within, the, structure, rather, than, on, the, surface, as, in, most, species, the, pollen, moves, through, pores, in, the, anther, but, very, little, pollen, is, shed, without, some, kind, of, externally, induced, motion, the, ideal, vibratory, frequencies, to, release, pollen, grains, are, provided, by, an, insect, such, as, a, bumblebee, or, the, original, wild, halictid, pollinator, capable, of, engaging, in, a, behavior, known, as, buzz, pollination, which, honey, bees, cannot, perform, in, an, outdoors, setting, wind, or, animals, usually, provide, sufficient, motion, to, produce, commercially, viable, crops, pollination, and, fruit, formation, depend, on, meiosis, meiosis, is, central, to, the, processes, by, which, diploid, microspore, mother, cells, within, the, anther, give, rise, to, haploid, pollen, grains, and, megaspore, mother, cells, in, ovules, that, are, contained, within, the, ovary, give, rise, to, haploid, nuclei, union, of, haploid, nuclei, from, pollen, and, ovule, fertilization, can, occur, either, by, self, or, cross, pollination, fertilization, leads, to, the, formation, of, a, diploid, zygote, that, can, then, develop, into, an, embryo, within, the, emerging, seed, repeated, fertilizations, within, the, ovary, are, accompanied, by, maturation, of, the, ovary, to, form, the, tomato, fruit, homologs, of, the, reca, gene, including, rad51, play, a, key, role, in, homologous, recombinational, repair, of, dna, during, meiosis, a, rad51, homolog, is, present, in, the, anther, of, tomato, lycopersicon, esculentum, suggesting, that, recombinational, repair, occurs, during, meiosis, in, tomato, tomatoes, are, often, grown, in, greenhouses, in, cooler, climates, and, cultivars, such, as, the, british, moneymaker, and, a, number, of, cultivars, grown, in, siberia, are, specifically, bred, for, indoor, growing, in, more, temperate, climates, it, is, not, uncommon, to, start, seeds, in, greenhouses, during, the, late, winter, for, future, transplant, greenhouse, tomato, production, in, large, acreage, commercial, greenhouses, and, owner, operator, stand, alone, or, multiple, bay, greenhouses, is, on, the, increase, providing, fruit, during, those, times, of, the, year, when, field, grown, fruit, is, not, readily, available, smaller, sized, fruit, cherry, and, grape, or, cluster, tomatoes, fruit, on, the, vine, are, the, fruit, of, choice, for, the, large, commercial, greenhouse, operators, while, the, beefsteak, varieties, are, the, choice, of, owner, operator, growers, hydroponic, technique, is, often, used, in, hostile, growing, environments, as, well, as, high, density, plantings, to, facilitate, transportation, and, storage, tomatoes, are, often, picked, unripe, green, and, ripened, in, storage, with, ethylene, a, machine, harvestable, variety, of, tomato, the, square, tomato, was, developed, in, the, 1950s, by, university, of, california, davis, s, gordie, c, hanna, which, in, combination, with, the, development, of, a, suitable, harvester, revolutionized, the, tomato, growing, industry, this, type, of, tomato, is, grown, commercially, near, plants, that, process, and, can, tomatoes, tomato, sauce, and, tomato, paste, they, are, harvested, when, ripe, and, are, flavorful, when, picked, they, are, harvested, 24, hours, a, day, seven, days, a, week, during, a, 12, to, 14, week, season, and, immediately, transported, to, packing, plants, which, operate, on, the, same, schedule, california, is, a, center, of, this, sort, of, commercial, tomato, production, and, produces, about, a, third, of, the, processed, tomatoes, produced, in, the, world, in, 1994, calgene, introduced, a, genetically, modified, tomato, called, the, flavrsavr, which, could, be, vine, ripened, without, compromising, shelf, life, however, the, product, was, not, commercially, successful, and, was, sold, only, until, 1997, the, world, dedicated, 4, 8, million, hectares, in, 2012, for, tomato, cultivation, and, the, total, production, was, about, 161, 8, million, tonnes, the, average, world, farm, yield, for, tomato, was, 33, 6, tonnes, per, hectare, in, 2012, tomato, farms, in, the, netherlands, were, the, most, productive, in, 2012, with, a, nationwide, average, of, 476, tonnes, per, hectare, followed, by, belgium, 463, tonnes, per, hectare, and, iceland, 429, tonnes, per, hectare, as, of, 2008, the, heaviest, tomato, harvested, weighed, 3, 51, kg, 7, lb, 12, oz, was, of, the, cultivar, delicious, and, was, grown, by, gordon, graham, of, edmond, oklahoma, in, 1986, the, largest, tomato, plant, grown, was, of, the, cultivar, sungold, and, reached, 19, 8, m, 65, ft, in, length, grown, by, nutriculture, ltd, uk, of, mawdesley, lancashire, uk, in, 2000, a, massive, tomato, tree, growing, inside, the, walt, disney, world, resort, s, experimental, greenhouses, in, lake, buena, vista, florida, may, have, been, the, largest, single, tomato, plant, in, the, world, the, plant, has, been, recognized, as, a, guinness, world, record, holder, with, a, harvest, of, more, than, 32, 000, tomatoes, and, a, total, weight, of, 522, kg, 1, 151, lb, it, yielded, thousands, of, tomatoes, at, one, time, from, a, single, vine, yong, huang, epcot, s, manager, of, agricultural, science, discovered, the, unique, plant, in, beijing, china, huang, brought, its, seeds, to, epcot, and, created, the, specialized, greenhouse, for, the, fruit, to, grow, the, vine, grew, golf, ball, sized, tomatoes, which, were, served, at, walt, disney, world, restaurants, the, tree, developed, a, disease, and, was, removed, in, april, 2010, after, about, 13, months, of, life, in, 2022, world, production, of, tomatoes, was, 186, million, tonnes, with, china, accounting, for, 37, of, the, total, followed, by, india, turkey, and, the, united, states, as, major, producers, table, the, leaves, stem, and, green, unripe, fruit, of, the, tomato, plant, contain, small, amounts, of, the, alkaloid, tomatine, whose, effect, on, humans, has, not, been, studied, they, also, contain, small, amounts, of, solanine, a, toxic, alkaloid, found, in, potato, leaves, and, other, plants, in, the, nightshade, family, however, solanine, concentrations, in, foliage, and, green, fruit, are, generally, too, small, to, be, dangerous, unless, large, amounts, are, consumed, for, example, as, greens, small, amounts, of, tomato, foliage, are, sometimes, used, for, flavoring, without, ill, effect, and, the, green, fruit, of, unripe, red, tomato, varieties, is, sometimes, used, for, cooking, particularly, as, fried, green, tomatoes, there, are, also, tomato, varieties, with, fully, ripe, fruit, that, is, still, green, compared, to, potatoes, the, amount, of, solanine, in, unripe, green, or, fully, ripe, tomatoes, is, low, however, even, in, the, case, of, potatoes, while, solanine, poisoning, resulting, from, dosages, several, times, the, normal, human, consumption, has, been, demonstrated, actual, cases, of, poisoning, from, excessive, consumption, of, potatoes, are, rare, tomato, plants, can, be, toxic, to, dogs, if, they, eat, large, amounts, of, the, fruit, or, chew, plant, material, tomatoes, were, linked, to, seven, salmonella, outbreaks, between, 1990, and, 2005, and, may, have, been, the, cause, of, a, salmonellosis, outbreak, causing, 172, illnesses, in, 18, us, states, in, 2006, the, 2008, united, states, salmonellosis, outbreak, caused, the, temporary, removal, of, tomatoes, from, stores, and, restaurants, across, the, united, states, and, parts, of, canada, although, other, foods, including, jalape, o, and, serrano, peppers, may, have, been, involved, though, it, is, botanically, a, berry, a, subset, of, fruit, the, tomato, is, considered, a, vegetable, for, culinary, purposes, it, has, a, strong, savoury, umami, flavour, rather, than, significant, sweetness, see, above, chef, heston, blumenthal, observed, that, the, inner, pulp, had, more, flavour, that, the, flesh, a, subsequent, academic, study, in, which, he, participated, confirmed, that, the, pulp, had, up, to, eleven, times, more, glutamic, acid, which, carries, umami, flavour, than, the, flesh, although, tomatoes, originated, in, the, americas, the, tomato, is, now, grown, and, eaten, around, the, world, it, is, used, in, diverse, ways, including, raw, in, salads, or, in, slices, stewed, incorporated, into, a, wide, variety, of, dishes, or, processed, into, ketchup, or, tomato, soup, unripe, green, tomatoes, can, also, be, breaded, and, fried, used, to, make, salsa, or, pickled, tomato, juice, is, sold, as, a, drink, and, is, used, in, cocktails, such, as, the, bloody, mary, tomatoes, have, become, extensively, used, in, mediterranean, cuisine, as, a, key, ingredient, in, pizza, and, many, pasta, sauces, tomatoes, are, also, used, in, spanish, and, catalan, dishes, such, as, gazpacho, and, pa, amb, tom, quet, tomato, became, a, key, ingredient, in, many, curry, dishes, in, south, asia, after, they, were, introduced, to, the, region, by, the, portuguese, in, the, 15th, century, tomatoes, keep, best, unwashed, at, room, temperature, and, out, of, direct, sunlight, it, is, not, recommended, to, refrigerate, them, as, they, take, a, mealy, texture, and, lose, flavour, storing, stem, down, can, prolong, shelf, life, as, it, may, keep, from, rotting, too, quickly, unripe, tomatoes, can, be, kept, in, a, paper, bag, to, ripen, tomatoes, are, easy, to, preserve, whole, chopped, or, as, tomato, sauce, or, concentrated, paste, by, home, canning, the, fruit, can, also, be, preserved, by, drying, sometimes, in, the, sun, where, climate, permits, and, sold, either, in, bags, or, in, jars, with, oil, a, raw, tomato, is, 95, water, contains, 4, carbohydrates, and, has, less, than, 1, each, of, fat, and, protein, see, table, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, of, raw, tomatoes, supply, 18, kilo, calories, and, are, a, moderate, source, of, vitamin, c, 17, of, the, daily, value, but, otherwise, have, low, micronutrient, content, table, an, extensive, review, in, 2022, found, and, specified, many, health, benefits, associated, with, eating, tomatoes, and, some, risks, due, both, to, external, factors, pesticides, microbial, contamination, heavy, metals, from, contaminated, soil, and, intrinsic, for, example, lycopene, at, least, as, a, supplement, has, anti, platelet, effect, undesirable, for, patients, on, blood, thinners, and, similar, medications, the, review, concludes, that, the, synergistic, effects, of, all, tomato, constituents, are, likely, to, outweigh, the, benefits, of, tomato, s, individual, constituents, such, as, lycopene, studies, in, 2014, and, 2015, did, not, find, conclusive, evidence, to, indicate, that, the, lycopene, in, tomatoes, or, in, supplements, affects, the, onset, of, cardiovascular, diseases, or, cancer, in, the, united, states, supposed, health, benefits, of, consuming, tomatoes, tomato, products, or, lycopene, to, affect, cancer, cannot, be, mentioned, on, packaged, food, products, without, a, qualified, health, claim, statement, in, a, scientific, review, of, potential, claims, for, lycopene, favorably, affecting, dna, skin, exposed, to, ultraviolet, radiation, heart, function, and, vision, the, european, food, safety, authority, concluded, in, 2011, that, the, evidence, for, lycopene, having, any, of, these, effects, was, inconclusive, the, potato, tuber, moth, phthorimaea, operculella, is, an, oligophagous, insect, that, prefers, to, feed, on, plants, of, the, family, solanaceae, such, as, tomato, plants, female, p, operculella, use, the, leaves, to, lay, their, eggs, and, the, hatched, larvae, will, eat, away, at,

spaniards, gathered, to, throw, 115, 000, kg, 254, 000, lb, of, tomatoes, at, each, other, in, the, festival, several, us, states, have, adopted, the, tomato, as, a, state, fruit, or, vegetable, see, above, tomatoes, have, been, designated, the, state, vegetable, of, new, jersey, arkansas, took, both, sides, by, declaring, the, south, arkansas, vine, ripe, pink, tomato, both, the, state, fruit, and, the, state, vegetable, in, the, same, law, citing, both, its, culinary, and, botanical, classifications, in, 2009, the, state, of, ohio, passed, a, law, making, the, tomato, the, state, s, official, fruit, tomato, juice, has, been, the, official, beverage, of, ohio, since, 1965, alexander, w, livingston, of, reynoldsburg, ohio, played, a, large, part, in, popularizing, the, tomato, in, the, late, 19th, century, his, efforts, are, commemorated, in, reynoldsburg, with, an, annual, tomato, festival, flavr, savr, was, the, first, commercially, grown, genetically, engineered, food, licensed, for, human, consumption, tomatoes, are, a, popular, nonlethal, throwing, weapon, in, mass, protests, and, there, was, a, common, tradition, of, throwing, rotten, tomatoes, at, bad, performers, on, a, stage, during, the, 19th, century, today, this, is, usually, referenced, as, a, metaphor, embracing, it, for, this, protest, connotation, the, dutch, socialist, party, adopted, the, tomato, as, their, logo, the, us, city, of, reynoldsburg, ohio, calls, itself, the, birthplace, of, the, tomato, claiming, the, first, commercial, variety, of, tomato, was, bred, there, in, the, 19th, century, rotten, tomatoes, is, an, american, review, aggregation, website, for, film, and, television, the, name, rotten, tomatoes, derives, from, the, practice, of, audiences, throwing, rotten, tomatoes, when, disapproving, of, a, poor, stage, performance
