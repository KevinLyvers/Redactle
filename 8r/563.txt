phrynosoma, whose, members, are, known, as, the, horned, lizards, horny, toads, or, horntoads, is, a, genus, of, north, american, lizards, and, the, type, genus, of, the, family, phrynosomatidae, their, common, names, refer, directly, to, their, horns, or, to, their, flattened, rounded, bodies, and, blunt, snouts, the, generic, name, phrynosoma, means, toad, bodied, in, common, with, true, toads, amphibians, of, the, family, bufonidae, horned, lizards, tend, to, move, sluggishly, often, remain, motionless, and, rely, on, their, remarkable, camouflage, to, avoid, detection, by, predators, they, are, adapted, to, arid, or, semiarid, areas, the, spines, on, the, lizard, s, back, and, sides, are, modified, reptile, scales, which, prevent, water, loss, through, the, skin, whereas, the, horns, on, the, head, are, true, horns, i, e, they, have, a, bony, core, a, urinary, bladder, is, absent, of, the, 21, species, of, horned, lizards, 15, are, native, to, the, usa, the, largest, bodied, and, most, widely, distributed, of, the, american, species, is, the, texas, horned, lizard, horned, lizards, use, a, variety, of, means, to, avoid, predation, their, coloration, generally, serves, as, camouflage, when, threatened, their, first, defense, is, to, remain, motionless, to, avoid, detection, if, approached, too, closely, they, generally, run, in, short, bursts, and, stop, abruptly, to, confuse, the, predator, s, visual, acuity, if, this, fails, they, puff, up, their, bodies, to, cause, them, to, appear, more, horned, and, larger, so, that, they, are, more, difficult, to, swallow, at, least, eight, species, p, asio, p, cornutum, p, coronatum, p, ditmarsi, p, hernandesi, p, orbiculare, p, solare, and, p, taurus, are, also, able, to, squirt, an, aimed, stream, of, blood, from, the, corners, of, the, eyes, for, a, distance, up, to, 5, ft, 1, 5, m, they, do, this, by, restricting, the, blood, flow, leaving, the, head, thereby, increasing, blood, pressure, and, rupturing, tiny, vessels, around, the, eyelids, the, blood, not, only, confuses, predators, but, also, tastes, foul, to, canine, and, feline, predators, it, appears, to, have, no, effect, against, predatory, birds, only, three, closely, related, species, p, mcallii, p, modestum, and, p, platyrhinos, are, certainly, known, to, either, be, unable, to, squirt, blood, or, only, do, it, extremely, rarely, while, previous, thought, held, that, compounds, were, added, to, the, blood, from, glands, in, the, ocular, sinus, cavity, current, research, has, shown, that, the, chemical, compounds, that, make, up, the, defense, are, already, in, the, circulating, blood, it, is, possible, that, their, diet, of, large, quantities, of, venomous, harvester, ants, could, be, a, factor, however, the, origin, and, structure, of, the, chemicals, responsible, are, still, unknown, the, blood, squirting, mechanism, increases, survival, after, contact, with, canine, predators, the, trait, may, provide, an, evolutionary, advantage, ocular, autohemorrhaging, has, also, been, documented, in, other, lizards, which, suggests, blood, squirting, could, have, evolved, from, a, less, extreme, defense, in, the, ancestral, branch, of, the, genus, recent, phylogenic, research, supports, this, claim, so, the, species, incapable, of, squirting, blood, apparently, have, lost, the, adaptation, for, reasons, yet, unstudied, to, avoid, being, picked, up, by, the, head, or, neck, a, horned, lizard, ducks, or, elevates, its, head, and, orients, its, cranial, horns, straight, up, or, back, if, a, predator, tries, to, take, it, by, the, body, the, lizard, drives, that, side, of, its, body, down, into, the, ground, so, the, predator, cannot, easily, get, its, lower, jaw, underneath, a, university, of, texas, publication, notes, that, horned, lizard, populations, continue, to, disappear, throughout, their, distribution, despite, protective, legislation, population, declines, are, attributed, to, a, number, of, factors, including, the, fragmentation, and, loss, of, habitat, from, real, estate, development, and, road, construction, the, planting, of, non, native, grasses, both, suburban, and, rural, conversion, of, native, land, to, pastureland, and, agricultural, uses, and, pesticides, additionally, predation, by, domestic, dogs, and, cats, place, continued, pressure, upon, horned, lizards, fire, ants, solenopsis, invicta, introduced, from, south, america, via, the, nursery, industry, s, potted, plants, pose, a, significant, threat, to, all, wildlife, including, horned, lizards, phrynosoma, species, do, not, eat, fire, ants, fire, ants, kill, many, species, of, wildlife, and, are, fierce, competitors, against, the, native, ants, which, horned, lizards, require, for, food, with, their, specialized, nutritional, content, fire, ants, have, given, all, ants, a, bad, reputation, and, human, attempts, to, eradicate, ants, including, invasive, species, and, the, native, species, on, which, the, lizards, prey, contribute, to, the, continued, displacement, of, native, ant, species, and, the, decline, of, horned, lizards, the, texas, horned, lizard, phrynosoma, cornutum, has, disappeared, from, almost, half, of, its, geographic, range, their, popularity, in, the, early, to, mid, 20th, century, pet, trade, where, collectors, took, thousands, from, the, wild, populations, to, sell, to, pet, distributors, without, provision, for, their, highly, specialized, nutritional, needs, primarily, formic, acid, from, harvester, ants, resulted, in, certain, death, for, almost, all, the, collected, lizards, in, 1967, the, state, of, texas, passed, protective, legislation, preventing, the, collection, exportation, and, sale, of, phrynosoma, and, by, the, early, 1970s, most, states, enacted, similar, laws, to, protect, and, conserve, horned, lizards, in, the, usa, as, recently, as, the, early, 2000s, though, the, state, of, nevada, still, allowed, commercial, sale, of, phrynosoma, species, despite, limited, federal, protection, in, mexico, horned, lizards, are, still, offered, in, mexican, pet, markets, throughout, the, country, in, 2014, the, center, for, biological, diversity, in, tucson, petitioned, the, oklahoma, department, of, wildlife, conservation, to, have, the, texas, horned, lizard, put, on, the, endangered, species, list, due, to, the, massive, decline, of, its, population, in, oklahoma, where, it, was, once, plentiful, the, center, said, it, may, later, seek, protection, for, the, animal, on, a, federal, level, it, also, said, that, reptiles, in, general, are, dying, off, at, up, to, 10, 000, times, their, historic, extinction, rate, greatly, due, to, human, influences, the, following, 21, species, listed, alphabetically,

trinomial, authority, in, parentheses, indicates, that, the, species, or, subspecies, was, originally, described, in, a, genus, other, than, phrynosoma, texas, designated, the, texas, horned, lizard,
