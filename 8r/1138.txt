as, a, short, lived, perennial, or, biennial, in, warmer, horticultural, zones, with, tropical, or, mediterranean, climates, there, are, many, varieties, of, basil, including, sweet, basil, thai, basil, o, basilicum, var, thyrsiflora, and, mrs, burns, lemon, o, basilicum, var, citriodora, o, basilicum, can, cross, pollinate, with, other, species, of, the, ocimum, genus, producing, hybrids, such, as, lemon, basil, o, citriodorum, and, african, blue, basil, o, kilimandscharicum, basil, is, an, annual, or, sometimes, perennial, herb, used, for, its, leaves, depending, on, the, variety, plants, can, reach, heights, of, between, 30, and, 150, centimetres, 1, and, 5, feet, basil, leaves, are, glossy, and, ovulate, with, smooth, or, slightly, toothed, edges, that, typically, cup, slightly, the, leaves, are, arranged, oppositely, along, the, square, stems, leaves, may, be, green, or, purple, its, flowers, are, small, and, white, and, grow, from, a, central, inflorescence, or, spike, that, emerges, from, the, central, stem, atop, the, plant, unusual, among, lamiaceae, the, four, stamens, and, the, pistil, are, not, pushed, under, the, upper, lip, of, the, corolla, but, lie, over, the, inferior, lip, after, entomophilous, pollination, the, corolla, falls, off, and, four, round, achenes, develop, inside, the, bilabiate, calyx, the, various, basils, have, such, distinct, scents, because, the, volatile, aromatic, compounds, vary, with, cultivars, the, essential, oil, from, european, basil, contains, high, concentrations, of, linalool, and, methyl, chavicol, estragole, in, a, ratio, of, about, 3, 1, other, constituents, include, 1, 8, cineole, eugenol, and, myrcene, among, others, the, clove, scent, of, sweet, basil, is, derived, from, eugenol, the, aroma, profile, of, basil, includes, 1, 8, cineole, and, methyl, eugenol, in, this, species, eugenol, is, synthesised, from, coniferyl, acetate, and, nadph, some, similar, species, in, the, same, genus, may, be, commonly, called, basil, although, they, are, not, varieties, of, ocimum, basilicum, the, exact, taxonomy, of, basil, is, uncertain, due, to, the, immense, number, of, cultivars, its, ready, polymorphy, and, frequent, cross, pollination, resulting, in, new, hybrids, with, other, members, of, the, genus, ocimum, and, within, the, species, ocimum, basilicum, has, at, least, 60, varieties, which, further, complicates, taxonomy, most, basils, are, cultivars, of, sweet, basil, most, basil, varieties, have, green, leaves, but, a, few, are, purple, such, as, purple, delight, the, name, basil, comes, from, the, latin, basilius, and, the, greek, basilik, n, phyt, n, meaning, royal, kingly, plant, possibly, because, the, plant, was, believed, to, have, been, used, in, production, of,

an, antidote, to, the, basilisk, s, venom, basil, is, native, to, india, and, other, tropical, regions, stretching, from, africa, to, south, east, asia, but, has, now, become, globalized, due, to, human, cultivation, basil, is, sensitive, to, cold, with, best, growth, in, hot, dry, conditions, it, behaves, as, an, annual, if, there, is, any, chance, of, a, frost, however, due, to, its, popularity, basil, is, cultivated, in, many, countries, around, the, world, production, areas, include, countries, in, the, mediterranean, area, those, in, the, temperate, zone, and, others, in, subtropical, climates, in, northern, europe, canada, the, northern, states, of, the, u, s, and, the, south, island, of, new, zealand, basil, grows, best, if, sown, under, glass, in, a, peat, pot, then, planted, out, in, late, spring, early, summer, when, there, is, little, chance, of, a, frost, however, it, can, also, thrive, when, planted, outside, in, these, climates, additionally, it, may, be, sown, in, soil, once, chance, of, frost, is, past, it, fares, best, in, well, drained, soil, with, direct, exposure, to, the, sun, although, basil, grows, best, outdoors, it, can, be, grown, indoors, in, a, pot, and, like, most, herbs, will, do, best, on, a, sun, facing, windowsill, kept, away, from, extremely, cold, drafts, a, greenhouse, or, row, cover, is, ideal, if, available, it, can, however, even, be, grown, in, a, basement, under, fluorescent, lights, supplemental, lighting, produces, greater, biomass, and, phenol, production, with, red, blue, specifically, increasing, growth, and, flower, bud, production, uv, b, increases, the, volatiles, in, o, basilicum, essential, oil, which, has, not, been, reproducible, in, other, plants, and, so, may, be, unique, to, the, genus, or, even, to, this, species, basil, plants, require, regular, watering, but, not, as, much, attention, as, is, needed, in, other, climates, if, its, leaves, have, wilted, from, lack, of, water, it, will, recover, if, watered, thoroughly, and, placed, in, a, sunny, location, yellow, leaves, towards, the, bottom, of, the, plant, are, an, indication, that, the, plant, has, been, stressed, usually, this, means, that, it, needs, less, water, or, less, or, more, fertilizer, basil, can, be, propagated, reliably, from, cuttings, with, the, stems, of, short, cuttings, suspended, in, water, for, two, weeks, or, until, roots, develop, once, a, stem, produces, flowers, foliage, production, stops, on, that, stem, the, stem, becomes, woody, and, essential, oil, production, declines, to, prevent, this, a, basil, grower, may, pinch, off, any, flower, stems, before, they, are, fully, mature, because, only, the, blooming, stem, is, so, affected, some, stems, can, be, pinched, for, leaf, production, while, others, are, left, to, bloom, for, decoration, or, seeds, picking, the, leaves, off, the, plant, helps, promote, growth, largely, because, the, plant, responds, by, converting, pairs, of, leaflets, next, to, the, topmost, leaves, into, new, stems, once, the, plant, is, allowed, to, flower, it, may, produce, seed, pods, containing, small, black, seeds, which, can, be, saved, and, planted, the, following, year, if, allowed, to, go, to, seed, a, basil, plant, will, grow, back, the, next, year, basil, suffers, from, several, plant, pathogens, that, can, ruin, the, crop, and, reduce, yield, fusarium, wilt, is, a, soil, borne, fungal, disease, that, will, quickly, kill, younger, basil, plants, seedlings, may, be, killed, by, pythium, damping, off, a, common, foliar, disease, of, basil, is, gray, mold, caused, by, botrytis, cinerea, it, can, cause, infections, post, harvest, and, is, capable, of, killing, the, entire, plant, black, spot, can, be, seen, on, basil, foliage, and, is, caused, by, the, fungi, genus, colletotrichum, downy, mildew, caused, by, peronospora, belbahrii, is, a, significant, disease, as, first, reported, in, italy, in, 2003, it, was, reported, in, the, florida, in, 2007, and, by, 2008, had, spread, along, the, eastern, united, states, reaching, canada, basil, cultivars, resistant, to, p, belbahrii, have, been, developed, non, pathogenic, bacteria, found, on, basil, include, novosphingobium, species, basil, is, most, commonly, used, fresh, in, recipes, in, general, it, is, added, last, as, cooking, quickly, destroys, the, flavor, the, fresh, herb, can, be, kept, for, a, short, time, in, plastic, bags, in, the, refrigerator, or, for, a, longer, period, in, the, freezer, after, being, blanched, quickly, in, boiling, water, the, most, commonly, used, mediterranean, basil, cultivars, are, genovese, purple, ruffles, mammoth, cinnamon, lemon, globe, and, african, blue, basil, is, one, of, the, main, ingredients, in, pesto, an, italian, sauce, with, olive, oil, and, basil, as, its, primary, ingredients, many, national, cuisines, use, fresh, or, dried, basils, in, soups, and, other, foods, such, as, to, thicken, soups, basil, is, commonly, steeped, in, cream, or, milk, to, create, flavor, in, ice, cream, or, chocolate, truffles, lemon, basil, has, a, strong, lemony, smell, and, flavor, due, to, the, presence, of, citral, it, is, widely, used, in, indonesia, where, it, is, called, kemangi, and, served, raw, as, an, accompaniment, to, meat, or, fish, when, soaked, in, water, the, seeds, of, several, basil, varieties, become, gelatinous, and, are, used, in, asian, drinks, and, desserts, such, as, the, indian, faluda, the, iranian, sharbat, e, rihan, or, h, t, in, kashmir, the, ramadan, fast, is, often,

of, the, essential, oil, have, shown, insecticidal, and, insect, repelling, properties, including, potential, toxicity, to, mosquitos, the, essential, oil, is, found, by, huignard, et, al, 2008, to, inhibit, electrical, activity, by, decreasing, action, potential, amplitude, by, shortening, the, post, hyperpolarization, phase, and, reducing, the, action, frequency, of, action, potentials, in, huignard, s, opinion, this, is, due, to, the, linalool, and, estragole, the, amplitude, reduction, due, to, linalool, and, the, phase, shortening, due, to, both, callosobruchus, maculatus, a, pest, which, affects, cowpea, is, repelled, by, the, essential, oil, the, essential, oil, mixed, with, kaolin, is, both, an, adulticide, and, an, ovicide, effective, for, three, months, against, c, maculatus, in, cowpea, the, thrips, frankliniella, occidentalis, and, thrips, tabaci, are, repelled, by, o, basilicum, making, this, useful, as, an, insect, repellent, in, other, crops, the, pests, sitophilus, oryzae, stegobium, paniceum, tribolium, castaneum, and, bruchus, chinensis, are, evaluated, by, deshpande, et, al, 1974, and, 77, the, essential, oil, is, found, by, malik, et, al, 1987, and, sangwan, et, al, 1990, to, be, nematicidal, against, tylenchulus, semipenetrans, meloidogyne, javanica, anguina, tritici, and, heterodera, cajani, the, essential, oil, of, the, leaf, and, terminal, shoot, is, effective, against, a, large, number, of, bacterial, species, including, lactiplantibacillus, plantarum, and, pseudomonas, spp, the, essential, oil, of, the, leaf, and, terminal, shoot, is, also, effective, against, a, large, number, of, fungal, species, including, aspergillus, spp, candida, spp, mucor, spp, and, geotrichum, candidum, there, are, many, rituals, and, beliefs,
