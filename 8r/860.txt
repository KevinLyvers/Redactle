elephants, are, the, largest, living, land, animals, three, living, species, are, currently, recognised, the, african, bush, elephant, loxodonta, africana, the, african, forest, elephant, l, cyclotis, and, the, asian, elephant, elephas, maximus, they, are, the, only, surviving, members, of, the, family, elephantidae, and, the, order, proboscidea, extinct, relatives, include, mammoths, and, mastodons, distinctive, features, of, elephants, include, a, long, proboscis, called, a, trunk, tusks, large, ear, flaps, pillar, like, legs, and, tough, but, sensitive, grey, skin, the, trunk, is, prehensile, bringing, food, and, water, to, the, mouth, and, grasping, objects, tusks, which, are, derived, from, the, incisor, teeth, serve, both, as, weapons, and, as, tools, for, moving, objects, and, digging, the, large, ear, flaps, assist, in, maintaining, a, constant, body, temperature, as, well, as, in, communication, african, elephants, have, larger, ears, and, concave, backs, whereas, asian, elephants, have, smaller, ears, and, convex, or, level, backs, elephants, are, scattered, throughout, sub, saharan, africa, south, asia, and, southeast, asia, and, are, found, in, different, habitats, including, savannahs, forests, deserts, and, marshes, they, are, herbivorous, and, they, stay, near, water, when, it, is, accessible, they, are, considered, to, be, keystone, species, due, to, their, impact, on, their, environments, elephants, have, a, fission, fusion, society, in, which, multiple, family, groups, come, together, to, socialise, females, cows, tend, to, live, in, family, groups, which, can, consist, of, one, female, with, her, calves, or, several, related, females, with, offspring, the, leader, of, a, female, group, usually, the, oldest, cow, is, known, as, the, matriarch, males, bulls, leave, their, family, groups, when, they, reach, puberty, and, may, live, alone, or, with, other, males, adult, bulls, mostly, interact, with, family, groups, when, looking, for, a, mate, they, enter, a, state, of, increased, testosterone, and, aggression, known, as, musth, which, helps, them, gain, dominance, over, other, males, as, well, as, reproductive, success, calves, are, the, centre, of, attention, in, their, family, groups, and, rely, on, their, mothers, for, as, long, as, three, years, elephants, can, live, up, to, 70, years, in, the, wild, they, communicate, by, touch, sight, smell, and, sound, elephants, use, infrasound, and, seismic, communication, over, long, distances, elephant, intelligence, has, been, compared, with, that, of, primates, and, cetaceans, they, appear, to, have, self, awareness, and, possibly, show, concern, for, dying, and, dead, individuals, of, their, kind, african, bush, elephants, and, asian, elephants, are, listed, as, endangered, and, african, forest, elephants, as, critically, endangered, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, one, of, the, biggest, threats, to, elephant, populations, is, the, ivory, trade, as, the, animals, are, poached, for, their, ivory, tusks, other, threats, to, wild, elephants, include, habitat, destruction, and, conflicts, with, local, people, elephants, are, used, as, working, animals, in, asia, in, the, past, they, were, used, in, war, today, they, are, often, controversially, put, on, display, in, zoos, or, employed, for, entertainment, in, circuses, elephants, have, an, iconic, status, in, human, culture, and, have, been, widely, featured, in, art, folklore, religion, literature, and, popular, culture, the, word, elephant, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, elephas, genitive, elephantis, elephant, which, is, the, latinised, form, of, the, ancient, greek, elephas, genitive, elephantos, probably, from, a, non, indo, european, language, likely, phoenician, it, is, attested, in, mycenaean, greek, as, e, re, pa, genitive, e, re, pa, to, in, linear, b, syllabic, script, as, in, mycenaean, greek, homer, used, the, greek, word, to, mean, ivory, but, after, the, time, of, herodotus, it, also, referred, to, the, animal, the, word, elephant, appears, in, middle, english, as, olyfaunt, c, 1300, and, was, borrowed, from, old, french, oliphant, 12th, century, orycteropodidae, macroscelididae, chrysochloridae, tenrecidae, procaviidae, elephantidae, dugongidae, trichechidae, elephants, belong, to, the, family, elephantidae, the, sole, remaining, family, within, the, order, proboscidea, their, closest, extant, relatives, are, the, sirenians, dugongs, and, manatees, and, the, hyraxes, with, which, they, share, the, clade, paenungulata, within, the, superorder, afrotheria, elephants, and, sirenians, are, further, grouped, in, the, clade, tethytheria, three, species, of, living, elephants, are, recognised, the, african, bush, elephant, loxodonta, africana, forest, elephant, loxodonta, cyclotis, and, asian, elephant, elephas, maximus, african, elephants, were, traditionally, considered, a, single, species, loxodonta, africana, but, molecular, studies, have, affirmed, their, status, as, separate, species, mammoths, mammuthus, are, nested, within, living, elephants, as, they, are, more, closely, related, to, asian, elephants, than, to, african, elephants, another, extinct, genus, of, elephant, palaeoloxodon, is, also, recognised, which, appears, to, have, close, affinities, with, african, elephants, and, to, have, hybridised, with, african, forest, elephants, over, 180, extinct, members, of, order, proboscidea, have, been, described, the, earliest, proboscideans, the, african, eritherium, and, phosphatherium, are, known, from, the, late, paleocene, the, eocene, included, numidotherium, moeritherium, and, barytherium, from, africa, these, animals, were, relatively, small, and, some, like, moeritherium, and, barytherium, were, probably, amphibious, later, on, genera, such, as, phiomia, and, palaeomastodon, arose, the, latter, likely, inhabited, more, forested, areas, proboscidean, diversification, changed, little, during, the, oligocene, one, notable, species, of, this, epoch, was, eritreum, melakeghebrekristosi, of, the, horn, of, africa, which, may, have, been, an, ancestor, to, several, later, species, early, proboscideans, e, g, moeritherium, deinotheriidae, mammutidae, gomphotheriidae, stegodontidae, loxodonta, palaeoloxodon, mammuthus, elephas, a, major, event, in, proboscidean, evolution, was, the, collision, of, afro, arabia, with, eurasia, during, the, early, miocene, around, 18, 19, million, years, ago, allowing, proboscideans, to, disperse, from, their, african, homeland, across, eurasia, and, later, around, 16, 15, million, years, ago, into, north, america, across, the, bering, land, bridge, proboscidean, groups, prominent, during, the, miocene, include, the, deinotheres, along, with, the, more, advanced, elephantimorphs, including, mammutids, mastodons, gomphotheres, amebelodontids, which, includes, the, shovel, tuskers, like, platybelodon, choerolophodontids, and, stegodontids, around, 10, million, years, ago, the, earliest, members, of, the, family, elephantidae, emerged, in, africa, having, originated, from, gomphotheres, elephantids, are, distinguished, from, earlier, proboscideans, by, a, major, shift, in, the, molar, morphology, to, parallel, lophs, rather, than, the, cusps, of, earlier, proboscideans, allowing, them, to, become, higher, crowned, hypsodont, and, more, efficient, in, consuming, grass, the, late, miocene, saw, major, climactic, changes, which, resulted, in, the, decline, and, extinction, of, many, proboscidean, groups, the, earliest, members, of, the, modern, genera, of, elephantidae, appeared, during, the, latest, miocene, early, pliocene, around, 5, million, years, ago, the, elephantid, genera, elephas, which, includes, the, living, asian, elephant, and, mammuthus, mammoths, migrated, out, of, africa, during, the, late, pliocene, around, 3, 6, to, 3, 2, million, years, ago, over, the, course, of, the, early, pleistocene, all, non, elephantid, probobscidean, genera, outside, of, the, americas, became, extinct, with, the, exception, of, stegodon, with, gomphotheres, dispersing, into, south, america, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, and, mammoths, migrating, into, north, america, around, 1, 5, million, years, ago, at, the, end, of, the, early, pleistocene, around, 800, 000, years, ago, the, elephantid, genus, palaeoloxodon, dispersed, outside, of, africa, becoming, widely, distributed, in, eurasia, proboscideans, were, represented, by, around, 23, species, at, the, beginning, of, the, late, pleistocene, proboscideans, underwent, a, dramatic, decline, during, the, late, pleistocene, as, part, of, the, late, pleistocene, extinctions, of, most, large, mammals, globally, with, all, remaining, non, elephantid, proboscideans, including, stegodon, mastodons, and, the, american, gomphotheres, cuvieronius, and, notiomastodon, and, palaeoloxodon, becoming, extinct, with, mammoths, only, surviving, in, relict, populations, on, islands, around, the, bering, strait, into, the, holocene, with, their, latest, survival, being, on, wrangel, island, where, they, persisted, until, around, 4, 000, years, ago, over, the, course, of, their, evolution, probobscideans, grew, in, size, with, that, came, longer, limbs, and, wider, feet, with, a, more, digitigrade, stance, along, with, a, larger, head, and, shorter, neck, the, trunk, evolved, and, grew, longer, to, provide, reach, the, number, of, premolars, incisors, and, canines, decreased, and, the, cheek, teeth, molars, and, premolars, became, longer, and, more, specialised, the, incisors, developed, into, tusks, of, different, shapes, and, sizes, several, species, of, proboscideans, became, isolated, on, islands, and, experienced, insular, dwarfism, some, dramatically, reducing, in, body, size, such, as, the, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, tall, dwarf, elephant, species, palaeoloxodon, falconeri, elephants, are, the, largest, living, terrestrial, animals, some, species, of, the, extinct, elephant, genus, palaeoloxodon, considerably, exceeded, modern, elephants, in, size, making, them, among, the, largest, land, mammals, ever, the, skeleton, is, made, up, of, 326, 351, bones, the, vertebrae, are, connected, by, tight, joints, which, limit, the, backbone, s, flexibility, african, elephants, have, 21, pairs, of, ribs, while, asian, elephants, have, 19, or, 20, pairs, the, skull, contains, air, cavities, sinuses, that, reduce, the, weight, of, the, skull, while, maintaining, overall, strength, these, cavities, give, the, inside, of, the, skull, a, honeycomb, like, appearance, by, contrast, the, lower, jaw, is, dense, the, cranium, is, particularly, large, and, provides, enough, room, for, the, attachment, of, muscles, to, support, the, entire, head, the, skull, is, built, to, withstand, great, stress, particularly, when, fighting, or, using, the, tusks, the, brain, is, surrounded, by, arches, in, the, skull, which, serve, as, protection, because, of, the, size, of, the, head, the, neck, is, relatively, short, to, provide, better, support, elephants, are, homeotherms, and, maintain, their, average, body, temperature, at, 36, c, 97, f, with, a, minimum, of, 35, 2, c, 95, 4, f, during, the, cool, season, and, a, maximum, of, 38, 0, c, 100, 4, f, during, the, hot, dry, season, elephant, ear, flaps, or, pinnae, are, 1, 2, mm, 0, 039, 0, 079, in, thick, in, the, middle, with, a, thinner, tip, and, supported, by, a, thicker, base, they, contain, numerous, blood, vessels, called, capillaries, warm, blood, flows, into, the, capillaries, releasing, excess, heat, into, the, environment, this, effect, is, increased, by, flapping, the, ears, back, and, forth, larger, ear, surfaces, contain, more, capillaries, and, more, heat, can, be, released, of, all, the, elephants, african, bush, elephants, live, in, the, hottest, climates, and, have, the, largest, ear, flaps, the, ossicles, are, adapted, for, hearing, low, frequencies, being, most, sensitive, at, 1, khz, lacking, a, lacrimal, apparatus, tear, duct, the, eye, relies, on, the, harderian, gland, in, the, orbit, to, keep, it, moist, a, durable, nictitating, membrane, shields, the, globe, the, animal, s, field, of, vision, is, compromised, by, the, location, and, limited, mobility, of, the, eyes, elephants, are, dichromats, and, they, can, see, well, in, dim, light, but, not, in, bright, light, the, elongated, and, prehensile, trunk, or, proboscis, consists, of, both, the, nose, and, upper, lip, which, fuse, in, early, fetal, development, this, versatile, appendage, contains, up, to, 150, 000, separate, muscle, fascicles, with, no, bone, and, little, fat, these, paired, muscles, consist, of, two, major, types, superficial, surface, and, internal, the, former, are, divided, into, dorsal, ventral, and, lateral, muscles, while, the, latter, are, divided, into, transverse, and, radiating, muscles, the, muscles, of, the, trunk, connect, to, a, bony, opening, in, the, skull, the, nasal, septum, consists, of, small, elastic, muscles, between, the, nostrils, which, are, divided, by, cartilage, at, the, base, a, unique, proboscis, nerve, a, combination, of, the, maxillary, and, facial, nerves, lines, each, side, of, the, appendage, as, a, muscular, hydrostat, the, trunk, moves, through, finely, controlled, muscle, contractions, working, both, with, and, against, each, other, using, three, basic, movements, bending, twisting, and, longitudinal, stretching, or, retracting, the, trunk, has, near, unlimited, flexibility, objects, grasped, by, the, end, of, the, trunk, can, be, moved, to, the, mouth, by, curving, the, appendage, inward, the, trunk, can, also, bend, at, different, points, by, creating, stiffened, pseudo, joints, the, tip, can, be, moved, in, a, way, similar, to, the, human, hand, the, skin, is, more, elastic, on, the, dorsal, side, of, the, elephant, trunk, than, underneath, allowing, the, animal, to, stretch, and, coil, while, maintaining, a, strong, grasp, the, african, elephants, have, two, finger, like, extensions, at, the, tip, of, the, trunk, that, allow, them, to, pluck, small, food, the, asian, elephant, has, only, one, and, relies, more, on, wrapping, around, a, food, item, asian, elephant, trunks, have, better, motor, coordination, the, trunk, s, extreme, flexibility, allows, it, to, forage, and, wrestle, other, elephants, with, it, it, is, powerful, enough, to, lift, up, to, 350, kg, 770, lb, but, it, also, has, the, precision, to, crack, a, peanut, shell, without, breaking, the, seed, with, its, trunk, an, elephant, can, reach, items, up, to, 7, m, 23, ft, high, and, dig, for, water, in, the, mud, or, sand, below, it, also, uses, it, to, clean, itself, individuals, may, show, lateral, preference, when, grasping, with, their, trunks, some, prefer, to, twist, them, to, the, left, others, to, the, right, elephant, trunks, are, capable, of, powerful, siphoning, they, can, expand, their, nostrils, by, 30, leading, to, a, 64, greater, nasal, volume, and, can, breathe, in, almost, 30, times, faster, than, a, human, sneeze, at, over, 150, m, s, 490, ft, s, they, suck, up, water, which, is, squirted, into, the, mouth, or, over, the, body, the, trunk, of, an, adult, asian, elephant, is, capable, of, retaining, 8, 5, l, 2, 2, us, gal, of, water, they, will, also, sprinkle, dust, or, grass, on, themselves, when, underwater, the, elephant, uses, its, trunk, as, a, snorkel, the, trunk, also, acts, as, a, sense, organ, its, sense, of, smell, may, be, four, times, greater, than, a, bloodhound, s, nose, the, infraorbital, nerve, which, makes, the, trunk, sensitive, to, touch, is, thicker, than, both, the, optic, and, auditory, nerves, whiskers, grow, all, along, the, trunk, and, are, particularly, packed, at, the, tip, where, they, contribute, to, its, tactile, sensitivity, unlike, those, of, many, mammals, such, as, cats, and, rats, elephant, whiskers, do, not, move, independently, whisk, to, sense, the, environment, the, trunk, itself, must, move, to, bring, the, whiskers, into, contact, with, nearby, objects, whiskers, grow, in, rows, along, each, side, on, the, ventral, surface, of, the, trunk, which, is, thought, to, be, essential, in, helping, elephants, balance, objects, there, whereas, they, are, more, evenly, arranged, on, the, dorsal, surface, the, number, and, patterns, of, whiskers, are, distinctly, different, between, species, damaging, the, trunk, would, be, detrimental, to, an, elephant, s, survival, although, in, rare, cases, individuals, have, survived, with, shortened, ones, one, trunkless, elephant, has, been, observed, to, graze, using, its, lips, with, its, hind, legs, in, the, air, and, balancing, on, its, front, knees, floppy, trunk, syndrome, is, a, condition, of, trunk, paralysis, recorded, in, african, bush, elephants, and, involves, the, degeneration, of, the, peripheral, nerves, and, muscles, the, disorder, has, been, linked, to, lead, poisoning, elephants, usually, have, 26, teeth, the, incisors, known, as, the, tusks, 12, deciduous, premolars, and, 12, molars, unlike, most, mammals, teeth, are, not, replaced, by, new, ones, emerging, from, the, jaws, vertically, instead, new, teeth, start, at, the, back, of, the, mouth, and, push, out, the, old, ones, the, first, chewing, tooth, on, each, side, of, the, jaw, falls, out, when, the, elephant, is, two, to, three, years, old, this, is, followed, by, four, more, tooth, replacements, at, the, ages, of, four, to, six, 9, 15, 18, 28, and, finally, in, their, early, 40s, the, final, usually, sixth, set, must, last, the, elephant, the, rest, of, its, life, elephant, teeth, have, loop, shaped, dental, ridges, which, are, more, diamond, shaped, in, african, elephants, the, tusks, of, an, elephant, are, modified, second, incisors, in, the, upper, jaw, they, replace, deciduous, milk, teeth, at, 6, 12, months, of, age, and, keep, growing, at, about, 17, cm, 7, in, a, year, as, the, tusk, develops, it, is, topped, with, smooth, cone, shaped, enamel, that, eventually, wanes, the, dentine, is, known, as, ivory, and, has, a, cross, section, of, intersecting, lines, known, as, engine, turning, which, create, diamond, shaped, patterns, being, living, tissue, tusks, are, fairly, soft, and, about, as, dense, as, the, mineral, calcite, the, tusk, protrudes, from, a, socket, in, the, skull, and, most, of, it, is, external, at, least, one, third, of, the, tusk, contains, the, pulp, and, some, have, nerves, that, stretch, even, further, thus, it, would, be, difficult, to, remove, it, without, harming, the, animal, when, removed, ivory, will, dry, up, and, crack, if, not, kept, cool, and, wet, tusks, function, in, digging, debarking, marking, moving, objects, and, fighting, elephants, are, usually, right, or, left, tusked, similar, to, humans, who, are, typically, right, or, left, handed, the, dominant, or, master, tusk, is, typically, more, worn, down, as, it, is, shorter, and, blunter, for, african, elephants, tusks, are, present, in, both, males, and, females, and, are, around, the, same, length, in, both, sexes, reaching, up, to, 300, cm, 9, ft, 10, in, but, those, of, males, tend, to, be, more, massive, in, the, asian, species, only, the, males, have, large, tusks, female, asians, have, very, small, tusks, or, none, at, all, tuskless, males, exist, and, are, particularly, common, among, sri, lankan, elephants, asian, males, can, have, tusks, as, long, as, africans, but, they, are, usually, slimmer, and, lighter, the, largest, recorded, was, 302, cm, 9, ft, 11, in, long, and, weighed, 39, kg, 86, lb, hunting, for, elephant, ivory, in, africa, and, asia, has, resulted, in, an, effective, selection, pressure, for, shorter, tusks, and, tusklessness, an, elephant, s, skin, is, generally, very, tough, at, 2, 5, cm, 1, in, thick, on, the, back, and, parts, of, the, head, the, skin, around, the, mouth, anus, and, inside, of, the, ear, is, considerably, thinner, elephants, are, typically, grey, but, african, elephants, look, brown, or, reddish, after, rolling, in, coloured, mud, asian, elephants, have, some, patches, of, depigmentation, particularly, on, the, head, calves, have, brownish, or, reddish, hair, with, the, head, and, back, being, particularly, hairy, as, elephants, mature, their, hair, darkens, and, becomes, sparser, but, dense, concentrations, of, hair, and, bristles, remain, on, the, tip, of, the, tail, and, parts, of, the, head, and, genitals, normally, the, skin, of, an, asian, elephant, is, covered, with, more, hair, than, its, african, counterpart, their, hair, is, thought, to, help, them, lose, heat, in, their, hot, environments, although, tough, an, elephant, s, skin, is, very, sensitive, and, requires, mud, baths, to, maintain, moisture, and, protection, from, burning, and, insect, bites, after, bathing, the, elephant, will, usually, use, its, trunk, to, blow, dust, onto, its, body, which, dries, into, a, protective, crust, elephants, have, difficulty, releasing, heat, through, the, skin, because, of, their, low, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, which, is, many, times, smaller, than, that, of, a, human, they, have, even, been, observed, lifting, up, their, legs, to, expose, their, soles, to, the, air, elephants, only, have, sweat, glands, between, the, toes, but, the, skin, allows, water, to, disperse, and, evaporate, cooling, the, animal, in, addition, cracks, in, the, skin, may, reduce, dehydration, and, allow, for, increased, thermal, regulation, in, the, long, term, to, support, the, animal, s, weight, an, elephant, s, limbs, are, positioned, more, vertically, under, the, body, than, in, most, other, mammals, the, long, bones, of, the, limbs, have, cancellous, bones, in, place, of, medullary, cavities, this, strengthens, the, bones, while, still, allowing, haematopoiesis, blood, cell, creation, both, the, front, and, hind, limbs, can, support, an, elephant, s, weight, although, 60, is, borne, by, the, front, the, position, of, the, limbs, and, leg, bones, allows, an, elephant, to, stand, still, for, extended, periods, of, time, without, tiring, elephants, are, incapable, of, turning, their, manus, as, the, ulna, and, radius, of, the, front, legs, are, secured, in, pronation, elephants, may, also, lack, the, pronator, quadratus, and, pronator, teres, muscles, or, have, very, small, ones, the, circular, feet, of, an, elephant, have, soft, tissues, or, cushion, pads, beneath, the, manus, or, pes, which, allow, them, to, bear, the, animal, s, great, mass, they, appear, to, have, a, sesamoid, an, extra, toe, similar, in, placement, to, a, giant, panda, s, extra, thumb, that, also, helps, in, weight, distribution, as, many, as, five, toenails, can, be, found, on, both, the, front, and, hind, feet, elephants, can, move, both, forward, and, backward, but, are, incapable, of, trotting, jumping, or, galloping, they, can, move, on, land, only, by, walking, or, ambling, a, faster, gait, similar, to, running, in, walking, the, legs, act, as, pendulums, with, the, hips, and, shoulders, moving, up, and, down, while, the, foot, is, planted, on, the, ground, the, fast, gait, does, not, meet, all, the, criteria, of, running, since, there, is, no, point, where, all, the, feet, are, off, the, ground, although, the, elephant, uses, its, legs, much, like, other, running, animals, and, can, move, faster, by, quickening, its, stride, fast, moving, elephants, appear, to, run, with, their, front, legs, but, walk, with, their, hind, legs, and, can, reach, a, top, speed, of, 25, km, h, 16, mph, at, this, speed, most, other, quadrupeds, are, well, into, a, gallop, even, accounting, for, leg, length, spring, like, kinetics, could, explain, the, difference, between, the, motion, of, elephants, and, other, animals, the, cushion, pads, expand, and, contract, and, reduce, both, the, pain, and, noise, that, would, come, from, a, very, heavy, animal, moving, elephants, are, capable, swimmers, they, can, swim, for, up, to, six, hours, while, completely, waterborne, moving, at, 2, 1, km, h, 1, mph, and, traversing, up, to, 48, km, 30, mi, continuously, the, brain, of, an, elephant, weighs, 4, 5, 5, 5, kg, 10, 12, lb, compared, to, 1, 6, kg, 4, lb, for, a, human, brain, it, is, the, largest, of, all, terrestrial, mammals, while, the, elephant, brain, is, larger, overall, it, is, proportionally, smaller, than, the, human, brain, at, birth, an, elephant, s, brain, already, weighs, 30, 40, of, its, adult, weight, the, cerebrum, and, cerebellum, are, well, developed, and, the, temporal, lobes, are, so, large, that, they, bulge, out, laterally, their, temporal, lobes, are, proportionally, larger, than, those, of, other, animals, including, humans, the, throat, of, an, elephant, appears, to, contain, a, pouch, where, it, can, store, water, for, later, use, the, larynx, of, the, elephant, is, the, largest, known, among, mammals, the, vocal, folds, are, anchored, close, to, the, epiglottis, base, when, comparing, an, elephant, s, vocal, folds, to, those, of, a, human, an, elephant, s, are, proportionally, longer, thicker, with, a, greater, cross, sectional, area, in, addition, they, are, located, further, up, the, vocal, tract, with, an, acute, slope, the, heart, of, an, elephant, weighs, 12, 21, kg, 26, 46, lb, its, apex, has, two, pointed, ends, an, unusual, trait, among, mammals, in, addition, the, ventricles, of, the, heart, split, towards, the, top, a, trait, also, found, in, sirenians, when, upright, the, elephant, s, heart, beats, around, 28, beats, per, minute, and, actually, speeds, up, to, 35, beats, when, it, lies, down, the, blood, vessels, are, thick, and, wide, and, can, hold, up, under, high, blood, pressure, the, lungs, are, attached, to, the, diaphragm, and, breathing, relies, less, on, the, expanding, of, the, ribcage, connective, tissue, exists, in, place, of, the, pleural, cavity, this, may, allow, the, animal, to, deal, with, the, pressure, differences, when, its, body, is, underwater, and, its, trunk, is, breaking, the, surface, for, air, elephants, breathe, mostly, with, the, trunk, but, also, with, the, mouth, they, have, a, hindgut, fermentation, system, and, their, large, and, small, intestines, together, reach, 35, m, 115, ft, in, length, less, than, half, of, an, elephant, s, food, intake, gets, digested, despite, the, process, lasting, a, day, an, elephant, s, kidneys, can, produce, more, than, 50, litres, of, urine, per, day, a, male, elephant, s, testes, like, other, afrotheria, are,

reach, of, the, female, s, trunk, elephants, have, a, unique, organ, the, temporal, gland, located, on, both, sides, of, the, head, this, organ, is, associated, with, sexual, behaviour, and, males, secrete, a, fluid, from, it, when, in, musth, females, have, also, been, observed, with, these, secretions, elephants, are, herbivorous, and, will, eat, leaves, twigs, fruit, bark, grass, and, roots, african, elephants, mostly, browse, while, asian, elephants, mainly, graze, they, can, eat, as, much, as, 300, kg, 660, lb, of, food, and, drink, 40, l, 11, us, gal, of, water, in, a, day, elephants, tend, to, stay, near, water, sources, they, have, morning, afternoon, and, nighttime, feeding, sessions, at, midday, elephants, rest, under, trees, and, may, doze, off, while, standing, sleeping, occurs, at, night, while, the, animal, is, lying, down, elephants, average, 3, 4, hours, of, sleep, per, day, both, males, and, family, groups, typically, move, no, more, than, 20, km, 12, mi, a, day, but, distances, as, far, as, 180, km, 112, mi, have, been, recorded, in, the, etosha, region, of, namibia, elephants, go, on, seasonal, migrations, in, response, to, changes, in, environmental, conditions, in, northern, botswana, they, travel, 325, km, 202, mi, to, the, chobe, river, after, the, local, waterholes, dry, up, in, late, august, because, of, their, large, size, elephants, have, a, huge, impact, on, their, environments, and, are, considered, keystone, species, their, habit, of, uprooting, trees, and, undergrowth, can, transform, savannah, into, grasslands, smaller, herbivores, can, access, trees, mowed, down, by, elephants, when, they, dig, for, water, during, droughts, they, create, waterholes, that, can, be, used, by, other, animals, when, they, use, waterholes, they, end, up, making, them, bigger, at, mount, elgon, elephants, dig, through, caves, and, pave, the, way, for, ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds, and, insects, elephants, are, important, seed, dispersers, african, forest, elephants, consume, and, deposit, many, seeds, over, great, distances, with, either, no, effect, or, a, positive, effect, on, germination, in, asian, forests, large, seeds, require, giant, herbivores, like, elephants, and, rhinoceros, for, transport, and, dispersal, this, ecological, niche, cannot, be, filled, by, the, smaller, malayan, tapir, because, most, of, the, food, elephants, eat, goes, undigested, their, dung, can, provide, food, for, other, animals, such, as, dung, beetles, and, monkeys, elephants, can, have, a, negative, impact, on, ecosystems, at, murchison, falls, national, park, in, uganda, elephant, numbers, have, threatened, several, species, of, small, birds, that, depend, on, woodlands, their, weight, causes, the, soil, to, compress, leading, to, runoff, and, erosion, elephants, typically, coexist, peacefully, with, other, herbivores, which, will, usually, stay, out, of, their, way, some, aggressive, interactions, between, elephants, and, rhinoceros, have, been, recorded, the, size, of, adult, elephants, makes, them, nearly, invulnerable, to, predators, calves, may, be, preyed, on, by, lions, spotted, hyenas, and, wild, dogs, in, africa, and, tigers, in, asia, the, lions, of, savuti, botswana, have, adapted, to, hunting, elephants, targeting, calves, juveniles, or, even, sub, adults, there, are, rare, reports, of, adult, asian, elephants, falling, prey, to, tigers, elephants, tend, to, have, high, numbers, of, parasites, particularly, nematodes, compared, to, many, other, mammals, this, may, be, due, to, elephants, being, less, vulnerable, to, predation, in, other, mammal, species, individuals, weakened, by, significant, parasite, loads, are, easily, killed, off, by, predators, removing, them, from, the, population, elephants, are, generally, gregarious, animals, african, bush, elephants, in, particular, have, a, complex, stratified, social, structure, female, elephants, spend, their, entire, lives, in, tight, knit, matrilineal, family, groups, they, are, led, by, the, matriarch, who, is, often, the, eldest, female, she, remains, leader, of, the, group, until, death, or, if, she, no, longer, has, the, energy, for, the, role, a, study, on, zoo, elephants, found, that, the, death, of, the, matriarch, led, to, greater, stress, in, the, surviving, elephants, when, her, tenure, is, over, the, matriarch, s, eldest, daughter, takes, her, place, instead, of, her, sister, if, present, one, study, found, that, younger, matriarchs, take, potential, threats, less, seriously, large, family, groups, may, split, if, they, cannot, be, supported, by, local, resources, at, amboseli, national, park, kenya, female, groups, may, consist, of, around, ten, members, including, four, adults, and, their, dependent, offspring, here, a, cow, s, life, involves, interaction, with, those, outside, her, group, two, separate, families, may, associate, and, bond, with, each, other, forming, what, are, known, as, bond, groups, during, the, dry, season, elephant, families, may, aggregate, into, clans, these, may, number, around, nine, groups, in, which, clans, do, not, form, strong, bonds, but, defend, their, dry, season, ranges, against, other, clans, the, amboseli, elephant, population, is, further, divided, into, the, central, and, peripheral, subpopulations, female, asian, elephants, tend, to, have, more, fluid, social, associations, in, sri, lanka, there, appear, to, be, stable, family, units, or, herds, and, larger, looser, groups, they, have, been, observed, to, have, nursing, units, and, juvenile, care, units, in, southern, india, elephant, populations, may, contain, family, groups, bond, groups, and, possibly, clans, family, groups, tend, to, be, small, with, only, one, or, two, adult, females, and, their, offspring, a, group, containing, more, than, two, cows, and, their, offspring, is, known, as, a, joint, family, malay, elephant, populations, have, even, smaller, family, units, and, do, not, reach, levels, above, a, bond, group, groups, of, african, forest, elephants, typically, consist, of, one, cow, with, one, to, three, offspring, these, groups, appear, to, interact, with, each, other, especially, at, forest, clearings, adult, males, live, separate, lives, as, he, matures, a, bull, associates, more, with, outside, males, or, even, other, families, at, amboseli, young, males, may, be, away, from, their, families, 80, of, the, time, by, 14, 15, years, of, age, when, males, permanently, leave, they, either, live, alone, or, with, other, males, the, former, is, typical, of, bulls, in, dense, forests, a, dominance, hierarchy, exists, among, males, whether, they, are, social, or, solitary, dominance, depends, on, age, size, and, sexual, condition, male, elephants, can, be, quite, sociable, when, not, competing, for, mates, and, form, vast, and, fluid, social, networks, older, bulls, act, as, the, leaders, of, these, groups, the, presence, of, older, males, appears, to, subdue, the, aggression, and, deviant, behaviour, of, younger, ones, the, largest, all, male, groups, can, reach, close, to, 150, individuals, adult, males, and, females, come, together, to, breed, bulls, will, accompany, family, groups, if, a, cow, is, in, oestrous, adult, males, enter, a, state, of, increased, testosterone, known, as, musth, in, a, population, in, southern, india, males, first, enter, musth, at, 15, years, old, but, it, is, not, very, intense, until, they, are, older, than, 25, at, amboseli, no, bulls, under, 24, were, found, to, be, in, musth, while, half, of, those, aged, 25, 35, and, all, those, over, 35, were, in, some, areas, there, may, be, seasonal, influences, on, the, timing, of, musths, the, main, characteristic, of, a, bull, s, musth, is, a, fluid, discharged, from, the, temporal, gland, that, runs, down, the, side, of, his, face, behaviours, associated, with, musth, include, walking, with, a, high, and, swinging, head, nonsynchronous, ear, flapping, picking, at, the, ground, with, the, tusks, marking, rumbling, and, urinating, in, the, sheath, the, length, of, this, varies, between, males, of, different, ages, and, conditions, lasting, from, days, to, months, males, become, extremely, aggressive, during, musth, size, is, the, determining, factor, in, agonistic, encounters, when, the, individuals, have, the, same, condition, in, contests, between, musth, and, non, musth, individuals, musth, bulls, win, the, majority, of, the, time, even, when, the, non, musth, bull, is, larger, a, male, may, stop, showing, signs, of, musth, when, he, encounters, a, musth, male, of, higher, rank, those, of, equal, rank, tend, to, avoid, each, other, agonistic, encounters, typically, consist, of, threat, displays, chases, and, minor, sparring, rarely, do, they, full, on, fight, elephants, are, polygynous, breeders, and, most, copulations, occur, during, rainfall, an, oestrous, cow, uses, pheromones, in, her, urine, and, vaginal, secretions, to, signal, her, readiness, to, mate, a, bull, will, follow, a, potential, mate, and, assess, her, condition, with, the, flehmen, response, which, requires, him, to, collect, a, chemical, sample, with, his, trunk, and, taste, it, with, the, vomeronasal, organ, at, the, roof, of, the, mouth, the, oestrous, cycle, of, a, cow, lasts, 14, 16, weeks, with, the, follicular, phase, lasting, 4, 6, weeks, and, the, luteal, phase, lasting, 8, 10, weeks, while, most, mammals, have, one, surge, of, luteinizing, hormone, during, the, follicular, phase, elephants, have, two, the, first, or, anovulatory, surge, appears, to, change, the, female, s, scent, signaling, to, males, that, she, is, in, heat, but, ovulation, does, not, occur, until, the, second, or, ovulatory, surge, cows, over, 45, 50, years, of, age, are, less, fertile, bulls, engage, in, a, behaviour, known, as, mate, guarding, where, they, follow, oestrous, females, and, defend, them, from, other, males, most, mate, guarding, is, done, by, musth, males, and, females, seek, them, out, particularly, older, ones, musth, appears, to, signal, to, females, the, condition, of, the, male, as, weak, or, injured, males, do, not, have, normal, musths, for, young, females, the, approach, of, an, older, bull, can, be, intimidating, so, her, relatives, stay, nearby, for, comfort, during, copulation, the, male, rests, his, trunk, on, the, female, the, penis, is, mobile, enough, to, move, without, the, pelvis, before, mounting, it, curves, forward, and, upward, copulation, lasts, about, 45, seconds, and, does, not, involve, pelvic, thrusting, or, an, ejaculatory, pause, homosexual, behaviour, is, frequent, in, both, sexes, as, in, heterosexual, interactions, this, involves, mounting, male, elephants, sometimes, stimulate, each, other, by, playfighting, and, championships, may, form, between, old, bulls, and, younger, males, female, same, sex, behaviours, have, been, documented, only, in, captivity, where, they, engage, in, mutual, masturbation, with, their, trunks, gestation, in, elephants, typically, lasts, between, one, and, a, half, and, two, years, and, the, female, will, not, give, birth, again, for, at, least, four, years, the, relatively, long, pregnancy, is, supported, by, several, corpus, luteums, and, gives, the, foetus, more, time, to, develop, particularly, the, brain, and, trunk, births, tend, to, take, place, during, the, wet, season, typically, only, a, single, young, is, born, but, twins, sometimes, occur, calves, are, born, roughly, 85, cm, 33, in, tall, and, with, a, weight, of, around, 120, kg, 260, lb, they, are, precocial, and, quickly, stand, and, walk, to, follow, their, mother, and, family, herd, a, newborn, calf, will, attract, the, attention, of, all, the, herd, members, adults, and, most, of, the, other, young, will, gather, around, the, newborn, touching, and, caressing, it, with, their, trunks, for, the, first, few, days, the, mother, limits, access, to, her, young, alloparenting, where, a, calf, is, cared, for, by, someone, other, than, its, mother, takes, place, in, some, family, groups, allomothers, are, typically, aged, two, to, twelve, years, for, the, first, few, days, the, newborn, is, unsteady, on, its, feet, and, needs, its, mother, s, help, it, relies, on, touch, smell, and, hearing, as, its, eyesight, is, less, developed, with, little, coordination, in, its, trunk, it, can, only, flop, it, around, which, may, cause, it, to, trip, when, it, reaches, its, second, week, the, calf, can, walk, with, more, balance, and, has, more, control, over, its, trunk, after, its, first, month, the, trunk, can, grab, and, hold, objects, but, still, lacks, sucking, abilities, and, the, calf, must, bend, down, to, drink, it, continues, to, stay, near, its, mother, as, it, is, still, reliant, on, her, for, its, first, three, months, a, calf, relies, entirely, on, its, mother, s, milk, after, which, it, begins, to, forage, for, vegetation, and, can, use, its, trunk, to, collect, water, at, the, same, time, there, is, progress, in, lip, and, leg, movements, by, nine, months, mouth, trunk, and, foot, coordination, are, mastered, suckling, bouts, tend, to, last, 2, 4, min, hr, for, a, calf, younger, than, a, year, after, a, year, a, calf, is, fully, capable, of, grooming, drinking, and, feeding, itself, it, still, needs, its, mother, s, milk, and, protection, until, it, is, at, least, two, years, old, suckling, after, two, years, may, improve, growth, health, and, fertility, play, behaviour, in, calves, differs, between, the, sexes, females, run, or, chase, each, other, while, males, play, fight, the, former, are, sexually, mature, by, the, age, of, nine, years, while, the, latter, become, mature, around, 14, 15, years, adulthood, starts, at, about, 18, years, of, age, in, both, sexes, elephants, have, long, lifespans, reaching, 60, 70, years, of, age, lin, wang, a, captive, male, asian, elephant, lived, for, 86, years, elephants, communicate, in, various, ways, individuals, greet, one, another, by, touching, each, other, on, the, mouth, temporal, glands, and, genitals, this, allows, them, to, pick, up, chemical, cues, older, elephants, use, trunk, slaps, kicks, and, shoves, to, control, younger, ones, touching, is, especially, important, for, mother, calf, communication, when, moving, elephant, mothers, will, touch, their, calves, with, their, trunks, or, feet, when, side, by, side, or, with, their, tails, if, the, calf, is, behind, them, a, calf, will, press, against, its, mother, s, front, legs, to, signal, it, wants, to, rest, and, will, touch, her, breast, or, leg, when, it, wants, to, suckle, visual, displays, mostly, occur, in, agonistic, situations, elephants, will, try, to, appear, more, threatening, by, raising, their, heads, and, spreading, their, ears, they, may, add, to, the, display, by, shaking, their, heads, and, snapping, their, ears, as, well, as, tossing, around, dust, and, vegetation, they, are, usually, bluffing, when, performing, these, actions, excited, elephants, also, raise, their, heads, and, spread, their, ears, but, additionally, may, raise, their, trunks, submissive, elephants, will, lower, their, heads, and, trunks, as, well, as, flatten, their, ears, against, their, necks, while, those, that, are, ready, to, fight, will, bend, their, ears, in, a, v, shape, elephants, produce, several, vocalisations, some, of, which, pass, though, the, trunk, for, both, short, and, long, range, communication, this, includes, trumpeting, bellowing, roaring, growling, barking, snorting, and, rumbling, elephants, can, produce, infrasonic, rumbles, for, asian, elephants, these, calls, have, a, frequency, of, 14, 24, hz, with, sound, pressure, levels, of, 85, 90, db, and, last, 10, 15, seconds, for, african, elephants, calls, range, from, 15, to, 35, hz, with, sound, pressure, levels, as, high, as, 117, db, allowing, communication, for, many, kilometres, possibly, over, 10, km, 6, mi, elephants, are, known, to, communicate, with, seismics, vibrations, produced, by, impacts, on, the, earth, s, surface, or, acoustical, waves, that, travel, through, it, an, individual, foot, stomping, or, mock, charging, can, create, seismic, signals, that, can, be, heard, at, travel, distances, of, up, to, 32, km, 20, mi, seismic, waveforms, produced, by, rumbles, travel, 16, km, 10, mi, elephants, are, among, the, most, intelligent, animals, they, exhibit, mirror, self, recognition, an, indication, of, self, awareness, and, cognition, that, has, also, been, demonstrated, in, some, apes, and, dolphins, one, study, of, a, captive, female, asian, elephant, suggested, the, animal, was, capable, of, learning, and, distinguishing, between, several, visual, and, some, acoustic, discrimination, pairs, this, individual, was, even, able, to, score, a, high, accuracy, rating, when, re, tested, with, the, same, visual, pairs, a, year, later, elephants, are, among, the, species, known, to, use, tools, an, asian, elephant, has, been, observed, fine, tuning, branches, for, use, as, flyswatters, tool, modification, by, these, animals, is, not, as, advanced, as, that, of, chimpanzees, elephants, are, popularly, thought, of, as, having, an, excellent, memory, this, could, have, a, factual, basis, they, possibly, have, cognitive, maps, which, give, them, long, lasting, memories, of, their, environment, on, a, wide, scale, individuals, may, be, able, to, remember, where, their, family, members, are, located, scientists, debate, the, extent, to, which, elephants, feel, emotion, they, are, attracted, to, the, bones, of, their, own, kind, regardless, of, whether, they, are, related, as, with, chimpanzees, and, dolphins, a, dying, or, dead, elephant, may, elicit, attention, and, aid, from, others, including, those, from, other, groups, this, has, been, interpreted, as, expressing, concern, however, the, oxford, companion, to, animal, behaviour, 1987, said, that, one, is, well, advised, to, study, the, behaviour, rather, than, attempting, to, get, at, any, underlying, emotion, african, bush, elephants, were, listed, as, endangered, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, in, 2021, and, african, forest, elephants, were, listed, as, critically, endangered, in, the, same, year, in, 1979, africa, had, an, estimated, population, of, at, least, 1, 3, million, elephants, possibly, as, high, as, 3, 0, million, a, decade, later, the, population, was, estimated, to, be, 609, 000, with, 277, 000, in, central, africa, 110, 000, in, eastern, africa, 204, 000, in, southern, africa, and, 19, 000, in, western, africa, the, population, of, rainforest, elephants, was, lower, than, anticipated, at, around, 214, 000, individuals, between, 1977, and, 1989, elephant, populations, declined, by, 74, in, east, africa, after, 1987, losses, in, elephant, numbers, hastened, and, savannah, populations, from, cameroon, to, somalia, experienced, a, decline, of, 80, african, forest, elephants, had, a, total, loss, of, 43, population, trends, in, southern, africa, were, various, with, unconfirmed, losses, in, zambia, mozambique, and, angola, while, populations, grew, in, botswana, and, zimbabwe, and, were, stable, in, south, africa, the, iucn, estimated, that, total, population, in, africa, is, estimated, at, to, 415, 000, individuals, for, both, species, combined, as, of, 2016, african, elephants, receive, at, least, some, legal, protection, in, every, country, where, they, are, found, successful, conservation, efforts, in, certain, areas, have, led, to, high, population, densities, while, failures, have, led, to, declines, as, high, as, 70, or, more, of, the, course, of, ten, years, as, of, 2008, local, numbers, were, controlled, by, contraception, or, translocation, large, scale, cullings, stopped, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, in, 1989, the, african, elephant, was, listed, under, appendix, i, by, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, of, wild, fauna, and, flora, cites, making, trade, illegal, appendix, ii, status, which, allows, restricted, trade, was, given, to, elephants, in, botswana, namibia, and, zimbabwe, in, 1997, and, south, africa, in,

for, elephant, trophies, in, 2020, the, iucn, listed, the, asian, elephant, as, endangered, due, to, the, population, declining, by, half, over, the, last, three, generations, asian, elephants, once, ranged, from, western, to, east, asia, and, south, to, sumatra, and, java, it, is, now, extinct, in, these, areas, and, the, current, range, of, asian, elephants, is, highly, fragmented, the, total, population, of, asian, elephants, is, estimated, to, be, around, 40, 000, 50, 000, although, this, may, be, a, loose, estimate, around, 60, of, the, population, is, in, india, although, asian, elephants, are, declining, in, numbers, overall, particularly, in, southeast, asia, the, population, in, the, western, ghats, may, have, stabilised, the, poaching, of, elephants, for, their, ivory, meat, and, hides, has, been, one, of, the, major, threats, to, their, existence, historically, numerous, cultures, made, ornaments, and, other, works, of, art, from, elephant, ivory, and, its, use, was, comparable, to, that, of, gold, the, ivory, trade, contributed, to, the, fall, of, the, african, elephant, population, in, the, late, 20th, century, this, prompted, international, bans, on, ivory, imports, starting, with, the, united, states, in, june, 1989, and, followed, by, bans, in, other, north, american, countries, western, european, countries, and, japan, around, the, same, time, kenya, destroyed, all, its, ivory, stocks, ivory, was, banned, internationally, by, cites, in, 1990, following, the, bans, unemployment, rose, in, india, and, china, where, the, ivory, industry, was, important, economically, by, contrast, japan, and, hong, kong, which, were, also, part, of, the, industry, were, able, to, adapt, and, were, not, as, badly, affected, zimbabwe, botswana, namibia, zambia, and, malawi, wanted, to, continue, the, ivory, trade, and, were, allowed, to, since, their, local, populations, were, healthy, but, only, if, their, supplies, were, from, culled, individuals, or, those, that, died, of, natural, causes, the, ban, allowed, the, elephant, to, recover, in, parts, of, africa, in, february, 2012, 650, elephants, in, bouba, njida, national, park, cameroon, were, slaughtered, by, chadian, raiders, this, has, been, called, one, of, the, worst, concentrated, killings, since, the, ivory, ban, asian, elephants, are, potentially, less, vulnerable, to, the, ivory, trade, as, females, usually, lack, tusks, still, members, of, the, species, have, been, killed, for, their, ivory, in, some, areas, such, as, periyar, national, park, in, india, china, was, the, biggest, market, for, poached, ivory, but, announced, they, would, phase, out, the, legal, domestic, manufacture, and, sale, of, ivory, products, in, may, 2015, and, in, september, 2015, china, and, the, united, states, said, they, would, enact, a, nearly, complete, ban, on, the, import, and, export, of, ivory, due, to, causes, of, extinction, other, threats, to, elephants, include, habitat, destruction, and, fragmentation, the, asian, elephant, lives, in, areas, with, some, of, the, highest, human, populations, and, may, be, confined, to, small, islands, of, forest, among, human, dominated, landscapes, elephants, commonly, trample, and, consume, crops, which, contributes, to, conflicts, with, humans, and, both, elephants, and, humans, have, died, by, the, hundreds, as, a, result, mitigating, these, conflicts, is, important, for, conservation, one, proposed, solution, is, the, protection, of, wildlife, corridors, which, give, populations, greater, interconnectivity, and, space, chili, pepper, products, as, well, as, guarding, with, defense, tools, have, been, found, to, be, effective, in, preventing, crop, raiding, by, elephants, less, effective, tactics, include, beehive, and, electric, fences, elephants, have, been, working, animals, since, at, least, the, indus, valley, civilization, over, 4, 000, years, ago, and, continue, to, be, used, in, modern, times, there, were, 13, 000, 16, 500, working, elephants, employed, in, asia, in, 2000, these, animals, are, typically, captured, from, the, wild, when, they, are, 10, 20, years, old, when, they, are, both, more, trainable, and, can, work, for, more, years, they, were, traditionally, captured, with, traps, and, lassos, but, since, 1950, tranquillisers, have, been, used, individuals, of, the, asian, species, have, been, often, trained, as, working, animals, asian, elephants, are, used, to, carry, and, pull, both, objects, and, people, in, and, out, of, areas, as, well, as, lead, people, in, religious, celebrations, they, are, valued, over, mechanised, tools, as, they, can, perform, the, same, tasks, but, in, more, difficult, terrain, with, strength, memory, and, delicacy, elephants, can, learn, over, 30, commands, musth, bulls, are, difficult, and, dangerous, to, work, with, and, so, are, chained, up, until, their, condition, passes, in, india, many, working, elephants, are, alleged, to, have, been, subject, to, abuse, they, and, other, captive, elephants, are, thus, protected, under, the, prevention, of, cruelty, to, animals, act, of, 1960, in, both, myanmar, and, thailand, deforestation, and, other, economic, factors, have, resulted, in, sizable, populations, of, unemployed, elephants, resulting, in, health, problems, for, the, elephants, themselves, as, well, as, economic, and, safety, problems, for, the, people, amongst, whom, they, live, the, practice, of, working, elephants, has, also, been, attempted, in, africa, the, taming, of, african, elephants, in, the, belgian, congo, began, by, decree, of, leopold, ii, of, belgium, during, the, 19th, century, and, continues, to, the, present, with, the, api, elephant, domestication, centre, historically, elephants, were, considered, formidable, instruments, of, war, they, were, described, in, sanskrit, texts, as, far, back, as, 1500, bc, from, south, asia, the, use, of, elephants, in, warfare, spread, west, to, persia, and, east, to, southeast, asia, the, persians, used, them, during, the, achaemenid, empire, between, the, 6th, and, 4th, centuries, bc, while, southeast, asian, states, first, used, war, elephants, possibly, as, early, as, the, 5th, century, bc, and, continued, to, the, 20th, century, war, elephants, were, also, employed, in, the, mediterranean, and, north, africa, throughout, the, classical, period, since, the, reign, of, ptolemy, ii, in, egypt, the, carthaginian, general, hannibal, famously, took, african, elephants, across, the, alps, during, his, war, with, the, romans, and, reached, the, po, valley, in, 218, bc, with, all, of, them, alive, but, died, of, disease, and, combat, a, year, later, an, elephant, s, head, and, sides, were, equipped, with, armour, the,

they, might, have, grasped, an, enemy, soldier, with, the, trunk, and, tossed, him, to, their, mahout, or, pinned, the, soldier, to, the, ground, and, speared, him, some, shortcomings, of, war, elephants, included, their, great, visibility, which, made, them, easy, to, target, and, limited, maneuverability, compared, to, horses, alexander, the, great, achieved, victory, over, armies, with, war, elephants, by, having, his, soldiers, injure, the, trunks, and, legs, of, the, animals, which, caused, them, to, panic, and, become, uncontrollable, elephants, have, traditionally, been, a, major, part, of, zoos, and, circuses, around, the, world, in, circuses, they, are, trained, to, perform, tricks, the, most, famous, circus, elephant, was, probably, jumbo, 1861, 15, september, 1885, who, was, a, major, attraction, in, the, barnum, bailey, circus, these, animals, do, not, reproduce, well, in, captivity, due, to, the, difficulty, of, handling, musth, bulls, and, limited, understanding, of, female, oestrous, cycles, asian, elephants, were, always, more, common, than, their, african, counterparts, in, modern, zoos, and, circuses, after, cites, listed, the, asian, elephant, under, appendix, i, in, 1975, imports, of, the, species, almost, stopped, by, the, end, of, the, 1980s, subsequently, the, us, received, many, captive, african, elephants, from, zimbabwe, which, had, an, overabundance, of, the, animals, keeping, elephants, in, zoos, has, met, with, some, controversy, proponents, of, zoos, argue, that, they, allow, easy, access, to, the, animals, and, provide, fund, and, knowledge, for, preserving, their, natural, habitats, as, well, as, safekeeping, for, the, species, opponents, claim, that, animals, in, zoos, are, under, physical, and, mental, stress, elephants, have, been, recorded, displaying, stereotypical, behaviours, in, the, form, of, wobbling, the, body, or, head, and, pacing, the, same, route, both, forwards, and, backwards, this, has, been, observed, in, 54, of, individuals, in, uk, zoos, elephants, in, european, zoos, appear, to, have, shorter, lifespans, than, their, wild, counterparts, at, only, 17, years, although, other, studies, suggest, that, zoo, elephants, live, just, as, long, the, use, of, elephants, in, circuses, has, also, been, controversial, the, humane, society, of, the, united, states, has, accused, circuses, of, mistreating, and, distressing, their, animals, in, testimony, to, a, us, federal, court, in, 2009, barnum, bailey, circus, ceo, kenneth, feld, acknowledged, that, circus, elephants, are, struck, behind, their, ears, under, their, chins, and, on, their, legs, with, metal, tipped, prods, called, bull, hooks, or, ankus, feld, stated, that, these, practices, are, necessary, to, protect, circus, workers, and, acknowledged, that, an, elephant, trainer, was, rebuked, for, using, an, electric, prod, on, an, elephant, despite, this, he, denied, that, any, of, these, practices, hurt, the, animals, some, trainers, have, tried, to, train, elephants, without, the, use, of, physical, punishment, ralph, helfer, is, known, to, have, relied, on, positive, reinforcement, when, training, his,

the, ancient, romans, who, kept, the, animals, in, captivity, depicted, elephants, more, accurately, than, medieval, europeans, who, portrayed, them, more, like, fantasy, creatures, with, horse, bovine, and, boar, like, traits, and, trumpet, like, trunks, as, europeans, gained, more, access, to, captive, elephants, during, the, 15th, century, depictions, of, them, became, more, accurate, including, one, made, by, leonardo, da, vinci, elephants, have, been, the, subject, of, religious, beliefs, the, mbuti, people, of, central, africa, believe, that, the, souls, of, their, dead,
