basal, angiosperms, core, angiosperms, flowering, plants, are, plants, that, bear, flowers, and, fruits, and, form, the, clade, angiospermae, n, d, i, s, p, r, m, i, commonly, called, angiosperms, they, include, all, forbs, flowering, plants, without, a, woody, stem, grasses, and, grass, like, plants, a, vast, majority, of, broad, leaved, trees, shrubs, and, vines, and, most, aquatic, plants, the, term, angiosperm, is, derived, from, the, greek, words, angeion, container, vessel, and, sperma, seed, meaning, that, the, seeds, are, enclosed, within, a, fruit, they, are, by, far, the, most, diverse, group, of, land, plants, with, 64, orders, 416, families, approximately, 13, 000, known, genera, and, 300, 000, known, species, angiosperms, were, formerly, called, magnoliophyta, m, n, o, l, i, f, t, f, a, t, angiosperms, are, distinguished, from, the, other, seed, producing, plants, the, gymnosperms, by, having, flowers, xylem, consisting, of, vessel, elements, instead, of, tracheids, endosperm, within, their, seeds, and, fruits, that, completely, envelop, the, seeds, the, ancestors, of, flowering, plants, diverged, from, the, common, ancestor, of, all, living, gymnosperms, before, the, end, of, the, carboniferous, over, 300, million, years, ago, in, the, cretaceous, angiosperms, diversified, explosively, becoming, the, dominant, group, of, plants, across, the, planet, agriculture, is, almost, entirely, dependent, on, angiosperms, and, a, small, number, of, flowering, plant, families, supply, nearly, all, plant, based, food, and, livestock, feed, rice, maize, and, wheat, provide, half, of, the, world, s, calorie, intake, and, all, three, plants, are, cereals, from, the, poaceae, family, colloquially, known, as, grasses, other, families, provide, materials, such, as, wood, paper, and, cotton, and, supply, numerous, ingredients, for, traditional, and, modern, medicines, flowering, plants, are, also, commonly, grown, for, decorative, purposes, with, certain, flowers, playing, a, significant, role, in, many, cultures, out, of, the, big, five, extinction, events, in, earth, s, history, only, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, had, occurred, while, angiosperms, dominated, plant, life, on, the, planet, today, the, holocene, extinction, affects, all, kingdoms, of, complex, life, on, earth, and, conservation, measures, are, necessary, to, protect, plants, in, their, habitats, in, the, wild, in, situ, or, failing, that, ex, situ, in, seed, banks, or, artificial, habitats, like, botanic, gardens, otherwise, around, 40, of, plant, species, may, become, extinct, due, to, human, actions, such, as, habitat, destruction, introduction, of, invasive, species, unsustainable, logging, and, collection, of, medicinal, or, ornamental, plants, further, climate, change, is, starting, to, impact, plants, and, is, likely, to, cause, many, species, to, become, extinct, by, 2100, angiosperms, are, terrestrial, vascular, plants, like, the, gymnosperms, they, have, roots, stems, leaves, and, seeds, they, differ, from, other, seed, plants, in, several, ways, the, largest, angiosperms, are, eucalyptus, gum, trees, of, australia, and, shorea, faguetiana, dipterocarp, rainforest, trees, of, southeast, asia, both, of, which, can, reach, almost, 100, metres, 330, ft, in, height, the, smallest, are, wolffia, duckweeds, which, float, on, freshwater, each, plant, less, than, 2, millimetres, 0, 08, in, across, considering, their, method, of, obtaining, energy, some, 99, of, flowering, plants, are, photosynthetic, autotrophs, deriving, their, energy, from, sunlight, and, using, it, to, create, molecules, such, as, sugars, the, remainder, are, parasitic, whether, on, fungi, like, the, orchids, for, part, or, all, of, their, life, cycle, or, on, other, plants, either, wholly, like, the, broomrapes, orobanche, or, partially, like, the, witchweeds, striga, in, terms, of, their, environment, flowering, plants, are, cosmopolitan, occupying, a, wide, range, of, habitats, on, land, in, fresh, water, and, in, the, sea, on, land, they, are, the, dominant, plant, group, in, every, habitat, except, for, frigid, moss, lichen, tundra, and, coniferous, forest, the, seagrasses, in, the, alismatales, grow, in, marine, environments, spreading, with, rhizomes, that, grow, through, the, mud, in, sheltered, coastal, waters, some, specialised, angiosperms, are, able, to, flourish, in, extremely, acid, or, alkaline, habitats, the, sundews, many, of, which, live, in, nutrient, poor, acid, bogs, are, carnivorous, plants, able, to, derive, nutrients, such, as, nitrate, from, the, bodies, of, trapped, insects, other, flowers, such, as, gentiana, verna, the, spring, gentian, are, adapted, to, the, alkaline, conditions, found, on, calcium, rich, chalk, and, limestone, which, give, rise, to, often, dry, topographies, such, as, limestone, pavement, as, for, their, growth, habit, the, flowering, plants, range, from, small, soft, herbaceous, plants, often, living, as, annuals, or, biennials, that, set, seed, and, die, after, one, growing, season, to, large, perennial, woody, trees, that, may, live, for, many, centuries, and, grow, to, many, metres, in, height, some, species, grow, tall, without, being, self, supporting, like, trees, by, climbing, on, other, plants, in, the, manner, of, vines, or, lianas, the, number, of, species, of, flowering, plants, is, estimated, to, be, in, the, range, of, 250, 000, to, 400, 000, this, compares, to, around, 12, 000, species, of, moss, and, 11, 000, species, of, pteridophytes, the, apg, system, seeks, to, determine, the, number, of, families, mostly, by, molecular, phylogenetics, in, the, 2009, apg, iii, there, were, 415, families, the, 2016, apg, iv, added, five, new, orders, boraginales, dilleniales, icacinales, metteniusales, and, vahliales, along, with, some, new, families, for, a, total, of, 64, angiosperm, orders, and, 416, families, the, diversity, of, flowering, plants, is, not, evenly, distributed, nearly, all, species, belong, to, the, eudicot, 75, monocot, 23, and, magnoliid, 2, clades, the, remaining, five, clades, contain, a, little, over, 250, species, in, total, i, e, less, than, 0, 1, of, flowering, plant, diversity, divided, among, nine, families, the, 25, most, species, rich, of, 443, families, containing, over, 166, 000, species, between, them, in, their, apg, circumscriptions, are, the, botanical, term, angiosperm, from, greek, words, ange, on, bottle, vessel, and, sp, rma, seed, was, coined, in, the, form, angiospermae, by, paul, hermann, in, 1690, including, only, flowering, plants, whose, seeds, were, enclosed, in, capsules, the, term, angiosperm, fundamentally, changed, in, meaning, in, 1827, with, robert, brown, when, angiosperm, came, to, mean, a, seed, plant, with, enclosed, ovules, in, 1851, with, wilhelm, hofmeister, s, work, on, embryo, sacs, angiosperm, came, to, have, its, modern, meaning, of, all, the, flowering, plants, including, dicotyledons, and, monocotyledons, the, apg, system, treats, the, flowering, plants, as, an, unranked, clade, without, a, formal, latin, name, angiosperms, a, formal, classification, was, published, alongside, the, 2009, revision, in, which, the, flowering, plants, rank, as, the, subclass, magnoliidae, from, 1998, the, angiosperm, phylogeny,

diversity, in, the, fossil, record, in, the, early, cretaceous, 130, mya, claimed, records, of, flowering, plants, prior, to, this, are, not, widely, accepted, molecular, evidence, suggests, that, the, ancestors, of, angiosperms, diverged, from, the, gymnosperms, during, the, late, devonian, about, 365, million, years, ago, the, origin, time, of, the, crown, group, of, flowering, plants, remains, contentious, by, the, late, cretaceous, angiosperms, appear, to, have, dominated, environments, formerly, occupied, by, ferns, and, gymnosperms, large, canopy, forming, trees, replaced, conifers, as, the, dominant, trees, close, to, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, 66, million, years, ago, the, radiation, of, herbaceous, angiosperms, occurred, much, later, the, characteristic, feature, of, angiosperms, is, the, flower, its, function, is, to, ensure, fertilization, of, the, ovule, and, development, of, fruit, containing, seeds, it, may, arise, terminally, on, a, shoot, or, from, the, axil, of, a, leaf, the, flower, bearing, part, of, the, plant, is, usually, sharply, distinguished, from, the, leaf, bearing, part, and, forms, a, branch, system, called, an, inflorescence, flowers, produce, two, kinds, of, reproductive, cells, microspores, which, divide, to, become, pollen, grains, are, the, male, cells, they, are, borne, in, the, stamens, the, female, cells, megaspores, divide, to, become, the, egg, cell, they, are, contained, in, the, ovule, and, enclosed, in, the, carpel, one, or, more, carpels, form, the, pistil, the, flower, may, consist, only, of, these, parts, as, in, wind, pollinated, plants, like, the, willow, where, each, flower, comprises, only, a, few, stamens, or, two, carpels, in, insect, or, bird, pollinated, plants, other, structures, protect, the, sporophylls, and, attract, pollinators, the, individual, members, of, these, surrounding, structures, are, known, as, sepals, and, petals, or, tepals, in, flowers, such, as, magnolia, where, sepals, and, petals, are, not, distinguishable, from, each, other, the, outer, series, calyx, of, sepals, is, usually, green, and, leaf, like, and, functions, to, protect, the, rest, of, the, flower, especially, the, bud, the, inner, series, corolla, of, petals, is, in, general, white, or, brightly, colored, is, more, delicate, in, structure, and, attracts, pollinators, by, colour, scent, and, nectar, most, flowers, are, hermaphroditic, producing, both, pollen, and, ovules, in, the, same, flower, but, some, use, other, devices, to, reduce, self, fertilization, heteromorphic, flowers, have, carpels, and, stamens, of, differing, lengths, so, animal, pollinators, cannot, easily, transfer, pollen, between, them, homomorphic, flowers, may, use, a, biochemical, self, incompatibility, to, discriminate, between, self, and, non, self, pollen, grains, dioecious, plants, such, as, holly, have, male, and, female, flowers, on, separate, plants, monoecious, plants, have, separate, male, and, female, flowers, on, the, same, plant, these, are, often, wind, pollinated, as, in, maize, but, include, some, insect, pollinated, plants, such, as, cucurbita, squashes, double, fertilization, requires, two, sperm, cells, to, fertilise, cells, in, the, ovule, a, pollen, grain, sticks, to, the, stigma, at, the, top, of, the, pistil, germinates, and, grows, a, long, pollen, tube, a, haploid, generative, cell, travels, down, the, tube, behind, the, tube, nucleus, the, generative, cell, divides, by, mitosis, to, produce, two, haploid, n, sperm, cells, the, pollen, tube, grows, from, the, stigma, down, the, style, and, into, the, ovary, when, it, reaches, the, micropyle, of, the, ovule, it, digests, its, way, into, one, of, the, synergids, releasing, its, contents, including, the, sperm, cells, the, synergid, that, the, cells, were, released, into, degenerates, one, sperm, makes, its, way, to, fertilise, the, egg, cell, producing, a, diploid, 2, n, zygote, the, second, sperm, cell, fuses, with, both, central, cell, nuclei, producing, a, triploid, 3, n, cell, the, zygote, develops, into, an, embryo, the, triploid, cell, develops, into, the, endosperm, the, embryo, s, food, supply, the, ovary, develops, into, a, fruit, and, each, ovule, into, a, seed, as, the, embryo, and, endosperm, develop, the, wall, of, the, embryo, sac, enlarges, and, combines, with, the, nucellus, and, integument, to, form, the, seed, coat, the, ovary, wall, develops, to, form, the, fruit, or, pericarp, whose, form, is, closely, associated, with, type, of, seed, dispersal, system, other, parts, of, the, flower, often, contribute, to, forming, the, fruit, for, example, in, the, apple, the, hypanthium, forms, the, edible, flesh, surrounding, the, ovaries, which, form, the, tough, cases, around, the, seeds, apomixis, setting, seed, without, fertilization, is, found, naturally, in, about, 2, 2, of, angiosperm, genera, some, angiosperms, including, many, citrus, varieties, are, able, to, produce, fruits, through, a, type, of, apomixis, called, nucellar, embryony, charles, darwin, in, his, 1878, book, the, effects, of, cross, and, self, fertilization, in, the, vegetable, kingdom, in, the, initial, paragraph, of, chapter, xii, noted, the, first, and, most, important, of, the, conclusions, which, may, be, drawn, from, the, observations, given, in, this, volume, is, that, generally, cross, fertilisation, is, beneficial, and, self, fertilisation, often, injurious, at, least, with, the, plants, on, which, i, experimented, flowers, emerged, in, plant, evolution, as, an, adaptation, for, the, promotion, of, cross, fertilisation, outcrossing, a, process, that, allows, the, masking, of, deleterious, mutations, in, the, genome, of, progeny, the, masking, effect, is, known, as, genetic, complementation, this, beneficial, effect, of, cross, fertilisation, on, progeny, is, also, referred, to, as, hybrid, vigor, or, heterosis, once, flowers, became, established, in, a, lineage, as, an, evolutionary, adaptation, to, promote, cross, fertilization, subsequent, switching, to, inbreeding, usually, becomes, disadvantageous, in, large, part, because, it, allows, expression, of, the, previously, masked, deleterious, recessive, mutations, i, e, inbreeding, depression, also, meiosis, in, flowering, plants, provides, a, direct, mechanism, for, repairing, dna, through, genetic, recombination, in, reproductive, tissues, sexual, reproduction, appears, to, be, required, for, maintaining, long, term, genomic, integrity, and, only, infrequent, combinations, of, extrinsic, and, intrinsic, factors, permit, shifts, to, asexuality, thus, the, two, fundamental, aspects, of, sexual, reproduction, in, flowering, plants, cross, fertilization, outcrossing, and, meiosis, appear, to, be, maintained, respectively, by, the, advantages, of, genetic, complementation, and, recombinational, repair, agriculture, is, almost, entirely, dependent, on, angiosperms, which, provide, virtually, all, plant, based, food, and, livestock, feed, much, of, this, food, derives, from, a, small, number, of, flowering, plant, families, for, instance, half, of, the, world, s, calorie, intake, is, supplied, by, just, three, plants, wheat, rice, and, maize, flowering, plants, provide, a, diverse, range, of, materials, in, the, form, of, wood, paper, fibers, such, as, cotton, flax, and, hemp, medicines, such, as, digoxin, and, opioids, and, decorative, and, landscaping, plants, coffee, and, hot, chocolate, are, beverages, from, flowering, plants, both, real, and, fictitious, plants, play, a, wide, variety, of, roles, in, literature, and, film, flowers, are, the, subjects, of, many, poems, by, poets, such, as, william, blake, robert, frost, and, rabindranath, tagore, bird, and, flower, painting, huaniaohua, is, a, kind, of, chinese, painting, that, celebrates, the, beauty, of, flowering, plants, flowers, have, been, used, in, literature, to, convey, meaning, by, authors, including, william, shakespeare, flowers, are, used, in, a, variety, of, art, forms, which, arrange, cut, or, living, plants, such, as, bonsai, ikebana, and, flower, arranging, ornamental, plants, have, sometimes, changed, the, course, of, history, as, in, tulipomania, many, countries, and, regions, have, floral, emblems, a, survey, of, 70, of, these, found, that, the, most, popular, flowering, plant, family, for, such, emblems, is, orchidaceae, at, 15, 7, 11, emblems, followed, by, fabaceae, at, 10, 7, emblems, and, asparagaceae, asteraceae, and, rosaceae, all, at, 5, 7, 4, emblems, each, human, impact, on, the, environment, has, driven, a, range, of, species, extinct, and, is, threatening, even, more, today, multiple, organizations, such, as, iucn, and, royal, botanic, gardens, kew, suggest, that, around, 40, of, plant, species, are, threatened, with, extinction, the, majority, are, threatened, by, habitat, loss, but, activities, such, as, logging, of, wild, timber, trees, and, collection, of, medicinal, plants, or, the, introduction, of, non, native, invasive, species, also, play, a, role, relatively, few, plant, diversity, assessments, currently, consider, climate, change, yet, it, is, starting, to, impact, plants, as, well, about, 3, of, flowering, plants, are, very, likely, to, be, driven, extinct, within, a, century, at, 2, c, 3, 6, f, of, global, warming, and, 10, at, 3, 2, c, 5, 8, f, in, worst, case, scenarios, half, of, all, tree, species, may, be, driven, extinct, by, climate, change, over, that, timeframe, conservation, in, this, context, is, the, attempt, to, prevent, extinction, whether, in, situ, by, protecting, plants, and, their, habitats, in, the, wild, or, ex, situ, in, seed, banks, or, as, living, plants, some, 3000, botanic, gardens, around, the, world, maintain, living, plants, including, over, 40, of, the, species, known, to, be, threatened, as, an, insurance, policy, against, extinction, in, the, wild, the, united, nations, global, strategy, for, plant, conservation, asserts, that, without, plants, there, is, no, life, it, aims, to, halt, the, continuing, loss, of, plant, diversity, throughout, the,
