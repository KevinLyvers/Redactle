calliasterellidae, trichasteropsida, starfish, or, sea, stars, are, star, shaped, echinoderms, belonging, to, the, class, asteroidea, s, t, r, d, i, common, usage, frequently, finds, these, names, being, also, applied, to, ophiuroids, which, are, correctly, referred, to, as, brittle, stars, or, basket, stars, starfish, are, also, known, as, asteroids, due, to, being, in, the, class, asteroidea, about, 1, 900, species, of, starfish, live, on, the, seabed, in, all, the, world, s, oceans, from, warm, tropical, zones, to, frigid, polar, regions, they, are, found, from, the, intertidal, zone, down, to, abyssal, depths, at, 6, 000, m, 20, 000, ft, below, the, surface, starfish, are, marine, invertebrates, they, typically, have, a, central, disc, and, usually, five, arms, though, some, species, have, a, larger, number, of, arms, the, aboral, or, upper, surface, may, be, smooth, granular, or, spiny, and, is, covered, with, overlapping, plates, many, species, are, brightly, coloured, in, various, shades, of, red, or, orange, while, others, are, blue, grey, or, brown, starfish, have, tube, feet, operated, by, a, hydraulic, system, and, a, mouth, at, the, centre, of, the, oral, or, lower, surface, they, are, opportunistic, feeders, and, are, mostly, predators, on, benthic, invertebrates, several, species, have, specialized, feeding, behaviours, including, eversion, of, their, stomachs, and, suspension, feeding, they, have, complex, life, cycles, and, can, reproduce, both, sexually, and, asexually, most, can, regenerate, damaged, parts, or, lost, arms, and, they, can, shed, arms, as, a, means, of, defense, the, asteroidea, occupy, several, significant, ecological, roles, starfish, such, as, the, ochre, sea, star, pisaster, ochraceus, and, the, reef, sea, star, stichaster, australis, have, become, widely, known, as, examples, of, the, keystone, species, concept, in, ecology, the, tropical, crown, of, thorns, starfish, acanthaster, planci, is, a, voracious, predator, of, coral, throughout, the, indo, pacific, region, and, the, northern, pacific, seastar, is, on, the, list, of, the, world, s, 100, worst, invasive, alien, species, the, fossil, record, for, starfish, is, ancient, dating, back, to, the, ordovician, around, 450, million, years, ago, but, it, is, rather, sparse, as, starfish, tend, to, disintegrate, after, death, only, the, ossicles, and, spines, of, the, animal, are, likely, to, be, preserved, making, remains, hard, to, locate, with, their, appealing, symmetrical, shape, starfish, have, played, a, part, in, literature, legend, design, and, popular, culture, they, are, sometimes, collected, as, curios, used, in, design, or, as, logos, and, in, some, cultures, despite, possible, toxicity, they, are, eaten, most, starfish, have, five, arms, that, radiate, from, a, central, disc, but, the, number, varies, with, the, group, some, species, have, six, or, seven, arms, and, others, have, 10, 15, arms, the, antarctic, labidiaster, annulatus, can, have, over, fifty, mapping, the, expression, patterns, of, genes, that, express, differently, across, the, body, axes, suggest, that, one, could, think, of, the, body, of, a, starfish, as, a, disembodied, head, walking, about, the, sea, floor, on, its, lips, the, known, markers, for, trunk, structures, are, expressed, only, in, internal, tissues, rather, than, on, the, surface, only, the, front, part, of, the, axis, which, specifies, head, related, structures, is, represented, on, the, body, surface, the, body, wall, consists, of, a, thin, cuticle, an, epidermis, consisting, of, a, single, layer, of, cells, a, thick, dermis, formed, of, connective, tissue, and, a, thin, coelomic, myoepithelial, layer, which, provides, the, longitudinal, and, circular, musculature, the, dermis, contains, an, endoskeleton, of, calcium, carbonate, components, known, as, ossicles, these, are, honeycombed, structures, composed, of, calcite, microcrystals, arranged, in, a, lattice, they, vary, in, form, with, some, bearing, external, granules, tubercles, and, spines, but, most, are, tabular, plates, that, fit, neatly, together, in, a, tessellated, manner, and, form, the, main, covering, of, the, aboral, surface, some, are, specialised, structures, such, as, the, madreporite, the, entrance, to, the, water, vascular, system, pedicellariae, and, paxillae, pedicellariae, are, compound, ossicles, with, forceps, like, jaws, they, remove, debris, from, the, body, surface, and, wave, around, on, flexible, stalks, in, response, to, physical, or, chemical, stimuli, while, continually, making, biting, movements, they, often, form, clusters, surrounding, spines, paxillae, are, umbrella, like, structures, found, on, starfish, that, live, buried, in, sediment, the, edges, of, adjacent, paxillae, meet, to, form, a, false, cuticle, with, a, water, cavity, beneath, in, which, the, madreporite, and, delicate, gill, structures, are, protected, all, the, ossicles, including, those, projecting, externally, are, covered, by, the, epidermal, layer, several, groups, of, starfish, including, valvatida, and, forcipulatida, possess, pedicellariae, in, forcipulatida, such, as, asterias, and, pisaster, they, occur, in, pompom, like, tufts, at, the, base, of, each, spine, whereas, in, the, goniasteridae, such, as, hippasteria, phrygiana, the, pedicellariae, are, scattered, over, the, body, surface, some, are, thought, to, assist, in, defence, while, others, aid, in, feeding, or, in, the, removal, of, organisms, attempting, to, settle, on, the, starfish, s, surface, some, species, like, labidiaster, annulatus, rathbunaster, californicus, and, novodinia, antillensis, use, their, large, pedicellariae, to, capture, small, fish, and, crustaceans, there, may, also, be, papulae, thin, walled, protrusions, of, the, body, cavity, that, reach, through, the, body, wall, and, extend, into, the, surrounding, water, these, serve, a, respiratory, function, the, structures, are, supported, by, collagen, fibres, set, at, right, angles, to, each, other, and, arranged, in, a, three, dimensional, web, with, the, ossicles, and, papulae, in, the, interstices, this, arrangement, enables, both, easy, flexion, of, the, arms, by, the, starfish, and, the, rapid, onset, of, stiffness, and, rigidity, required, for, actions, performed, under, stress, the, water, vascular, system, of, the, starfish, is, a, hydraulic, system, made, up, of, a, network, of, fluid, filled, canals, and, is, concerned, with, locomotion, adhesion, food, manipulation, and, gas, exchange, water, enters, the, system, through, the, madreporite, a, porous, often, conspicuous, sieve, like, ossicle, on, the, aboral, surface, it, is, linked, through, a, stone, canal, often, lined, with, calcareous, material, to, a, ring, canal, around, the, mouth, opening, a, set, of, radial, canals, leads, off, this, one, radial, canal, runs, along, the, ambulacral, groove, in, each, arm, there, are, short, lateral, canals, branching, off, alternately, to, either, side, of, the, radial, canal, each, ending, in, an, ampulla, these, bulb, shaped, organs, are, joined, to, tube, feet, podia, on, the, exterior, of, the, animal, by, short, linking, canals, that, pass, through, ossicles, in, the, ambulacral, groove, there, are, usually, two, rows, of, tube, feet, but, in, some, species, the, lateral, canals, are, alternately, long, and, short, and, there, appear, to, be, four, rows, the, interior, of, the, whole, canal, system, is, lined, with, cilia, when, longitudinal, muscles, in, the, ampullae, contract, valves, in, the, lateral, canals, close, and, water, is, forced, into, the, tube, feet, these, extend, to, contact, the, substrate, although, the, tube, feet, resemble, suction, cups, in, appearance, the, gripping, action, is, a, function, of, adhesive, chemicals, rather, than, suction, other, chemicals, and, relaxation, of, the, ampullae, allow, for, release, from, the, substrate, the, tube, feet, latch, on, to, surfaces, and, move, in, a, wave, with, one, arm, section, attaching, to, the, surface, as, another, releases, some, starfish, turn, up, the, tips, of, their, arms, while, moving, which, gives, maximum, exposure, of, the, sensory, tube, feet, and, the, eyespot, to, external, stimuli, having, descended, from, bilateral, organisms, starfish, may, move, in, a, bilateral, fashion, particularly, when, hunting, or, in, danger, when, crawling, certain, arms, act, as, the, leading, arms, while, others, trail, behind, most, starfish, cannot, move, quickly, a, typical, speed, being, that, of, the, leather, star, dermasterias, imbricata, which, can, manage, just, 15, cm, 6, in, in, a, minute, some, burrowing, species, from, the, genera, astropecten, and, luidia, have, points, rather, than, suckers, on, their, long, tube, feet, and, are, capable, of, much, more, rapid, motion, gliding, across, the, ocean, floor, the, sand, star, luidia, foliolata, can, travel, at, a, speed, of, 2, 8, m, 9, ft, 2, in, per, minute, when, a, starfish, finds, itself, upside, down, two, adjacent, arms, are, bent, backwards, to, provide, support, the, opposite, arm, is, used, to, stamp, the, ground, while, the, two, remaining, arms, are, raised, on, either, side, finally, the, stamping, arm, is, released, as, the, starfish, turns, itself, over, and, recovers, its, normal, stance, apart, from, their, function, in, locomotion, the, tube, feet, act, as, accessory, gills, the, water, vascular, system, serves, to, transport, oxygen, from, and, carbon, dioxide, to, the, tube, feet, and, also, nutrients, from, the, gut, to, the, muscles, involved, in, locomotion, fluid, movement, is, bidirectional, and, initiated, by, cilia, gas, exchange, also, takes, place, through, other, gills, known, as, papulae, which, are, thin, walled, bulges, on, the, aboral, surface, of, the, disc, and, arms, oxygen, is, transferred, from, these, to, the, coelomic, fluid, which, acts, as, the, transport, medium, for, gasses, oxygen, dissolved, in, the, water, is, distributed, through, the, body, mainly, by, the, fluid, in, the, main, body, cavity, the, circulatory, system, may, also, play, a, minor, role, the, gut, of, a, starfish, occupies, most, of, the, disc, and, extends, into, the, arms, the, mouth, is, located, in, the, centre, of, the, oral, surface, where, it, is, surrounded, by, a, tough, peristomial, membrane, and, closed, with, a, sphincter, the, mouth, opens, through, a, short, oesophagus, into, a, stomach, divided, by, a, constriction, into, a, larger, eversible, cardiac, portion, and, a, smaller, pyloric, portion, the, cardiac, stomach, is, glandular, and, pouched, and, is, supported, by, ligaments, attached, to, ossicles, in, the, arms, so, it, can, be, pulled, back, into, position, after, it, has, been, everted, the, pyloric, stomach, has, two, extensions, into, each, arm, the, pyloric, caeca, these, are, elongated, branched, hollow, tubes, that, are, lined, by, a, series, of, glands, which, secrete, digestive, enzymes, and, absorb, nutrients, from, the, food, a, short, intestine, and, rectum, run, from, the, pyloric, stomach, to, open, at, a, small, anus, at, the, apex, of, the, aboral, surface, of, the, disc, primitive, starfish, such, as, astropecten, and, luidia, swallow, their, prey, whole, and, start, to, digest, it, in, their, cardiac, stomachs, shell, valves, and, other, inedible, materials, are, ejected, through, their, mouths, the, semi, digested, fluid, is, passed, into, their, pyloric, stomachs, and, caeca, where, digestion, continues, and, absorption, ensues, in, more, advanced, species, of, starfish, the, cardiac, stomach, can, be, everted, from, the, organism, s, body, to, engulf, and, digest, food, when, the, prey, is, a, clam, or, other, bivalve, the, starfish, pulls, with, its, tube, feet, to, separate, the, two, valves, slightly, and, inserts, a, small, section, of, its, stomach, which, releases, enzymes, to, digest, the, prey, the, stomach, and, the, partially, digested, prey, are, later, retracted, into, the, disc, here, the, food, is, passed, on, to, the, pyloric, stomach, which, always, remains, inside, the, disc, the, retraction, and, contraction, of, the, cardiac, stomach, is, activated, by, a, neuropeptide, known, as, ngffyamide, because, of, this, ability, to, digest, food, outside, the, body, starfish, can, hunt, prey, much, larger, than, their, mouths, their, diets, include, clams, and, oysters, arthropods, small, fish, and, gastropod, molluscs, some, starfish, are, not, pure, carnivores, supplementing, their, diets, with, algae, or, organic, detritus, some, of, these, species, are, grazers, but, others, trap, food, particles, from, the, water, in, sticky, mucus, strands, that, are, swept, towards, the, mouth, along, ciliated, grooves, the, main, nitrogenous, waste, product, is, ammonia, starfish, have, no, distinct, excretory, organs, waste, ammonia, is, removed, by, diffusion, through, the, tube, feet, and, papulae, the, body, fluid, contains, phagocytic, cells, called, coelomocytes, which, are, also, found, within, the, hemal, and, water, vascular, systems, these, cells, engulf, waste, material, and, eventually, migrate, to, the, tips, of, the, papulae, where, a, portion, of, body, wall, is, nipped, off, and, ejected, into, the, surrounding, water, some, waste, may, also, be, excreted, by, the, pyloric, glands, and, voided, with, the, faeces, starfish, do, not, appear, to, have, any, mechanisms, for, osmoregulation, and, keep, their, body, fluids, at, the, same, salt, concentration, as, the, surrounding, water, although, some, species, can, tolerate, relatively, low, salinity, the, lack, of, an, osmoregulation, system, probably, explains, why, starfish, are, not, found, in, fresh, water, or, even, in, many, estuarine, environments, although, starfish, do, not, have, many, well, defined, sense, organs, they, are, sensitive, to, touch, light, temperature, orientation, and, the, status, of, the, water, around, them, the, tube, feet, spines, and, pedicellariae, are, sensitive, to, touch, the, tube, feet, especially, those, at, the, tips, of, the, rays, are, also, sensitive, to, chemicals, enabling, the, starfish, to, detect, odour, sources, such, as, food, there, are, eyespots, at, the, ends, of, the, arms, each, one, made, of, 80, 200, simple, ocelli, these, are, composed, of, pigmented, epithelial, cells, that, respond, to, light, and, are, covered, by, a, thick, transparent, cuticle, that, both, protects, the, ocelli, and, acts, to, focus, light, many, starfish, also, possess, individual, photoreceptor, cells, in, other, parts, of, their, bodies, and, respond, to, light, even, when, their, eyespots, are, covered, whether, they, advance, or, retreat, depends, on, the, species, while, a, starfish, lacks, a, centralized, brain, it, has, a, complex, nervous, system, with, a, nerve, ring, around, the, mouth, and, a, radial, nerve, running, along, the, ambulacral, region, of, each, arm, parallel, to, the, radial, canal, the, peripheral, nerve, system, consists, of, two, nerve, nets, a, sensory, system, in, the, epidermis, and, a, motor, system, in, the, lining, of, the, coelomic, cavity, neurons, passing, through, the, dermis, connect, the, two, the, ring, nerves, and, radial, nerves, have, sensory, and, motor, components, and, coordinate, the, starfish, s, balance, and, directional, systems, the, sensory, component, receives, input, from, the, sensory, organs, while, the, motor, nerves, control, the, tube, feet, and, musculature, the, starfish, does, not, have, the, capacity, to, plan, its, actions, if, one, arm, detects, an, attractive, odour, it, becomes, dominant, and, temporarily, over, rides, the, other, arms, to, initiate, movement, towards, the, prey, the, mechanism, for, this, is, not, fully, understood, the, body, cavity, contains, the, circulatory, or, haemal, system, the, vessels, form, three, rings, one, around, the, mouth, the, hyponeural, haemal, ring, another, around, the, digestive, system, the, gastric, ring, and, the, third, near, the, aboral, surface, the, genital, ring, the, heart, beats, about, six, times, a, minute, and, is, at, the, apex, of, a, vertical, channel, the, axial, vessel, that, connects, the, three, rings, at, the, base, of, each, arm, are, paired, gonads, a, lateral, vessel, extends, from, the, genital, ring, past, the, gonads, to, the, tip, of, the, arm, this, vessel, has, a, blind, end, and, there, is, no, continuous, circulation, of, the, fluid, within, it, this, liquid, does, not, contain, a, pigment, and, has, little, or, no, respiratory, function, but, is, probably, used, to, transport, nutrients, around, the, body, starfish, produce, a, large, number, of, secondary, metabolites, in, the, form, of, lipids, including, steroidal, derivatives, of, cholesterol, and, fatty, acid, amides, of, sphingosine, the, steroids, are, mostly, saponins, known, as, asterosaponins, and, their, sulphated, derivatives, they, vary, between, species, and, are, typically, formed, from, up, to, six, sugar, molecules, usually, glucose, and, galactose, connected, by, up, to, three, glycosidic, chains, long, chain, fatty, acid, amides, of, sphingosine, occur, frequently, and, some, of, them, have, known, pharmacological, activity, various, ceramides, are, also, known, from, starfish, and, a, small, number, of, alkaloids, have, also, been, identified, the, functions, of, these, chemicals, in, the, starfish, have, not, been, fully, investigated, but, most, have, roles, in, defence, and, communication, some, are, feeding, deterrents, used, by, the, starfish, to, discourage, predation, others, are, antifoulants, and, supplement, the, pedicellariae, to, prevent, other, organisms, from, settling, on, the, starfish, s, aboral, surface, some, are, alarm, pheromones, and, escape, eliciting, chemicals, the, release, of, which, trigger, responses, in, conspecific, starfish, but, often, produce, escape, responses, in, potential, prey, research, into, the, efficacy, of, these, compounds, for, possible, pharmacological, or, industrial, use, occurs, worldwide, most, species, of, starfish, are, gonochorous, there, being, separate, male, and, female, individuals, these, are, usually, not, distinguishable, externally, as, the, gonads, cannot, be, seen, but, their, sex, is, apparent, when, they, spawn, some, species, are, simultaneous, hermaphrodites, producing, eggs, and, sperm, at, the, same, time, and, in, a, few, of, these, the, same, gonad, called, an, ovotestis, produces, both, eggs, and, sperm, other, starfish, are, sequential, hermaphrodites, protandrous, individuals, of, species, like, asterina, gibbosa, start, life, as, males, before, changing, sex, into, females, as, they, grow, older, in, some, species, such, as, nepanthia, belcheri, a, large, female, can, split, in, half, and, the, resulting, offspring, are, males, when, these, grow, large, enough, they, change, back, into, females, each, starfish, arm, contains, two, gonads, that, release, gametes, through, openings, called, gonoducts, located, on, the, central, disc, between, the, arms, fertilization, is, generally, external, but, in, a, few, species, internal, fertilization, takes, place, in, most, species, the, buoyant, eggs, and, sperm, are, simply, released, into, the, water, free, spawning, and, the, resulting, embryos, and, larvae, live, as, part, of, the, plankton, in, others, the, eggs, may, be, stuck, to, the, undersides, of, rocks, in, certain, species, of, starfish, the, females, brood, their, eggs, either, by, simply, enveloping, them, or, by, holding, them, in, specialised, structures, brooding, may, be, done, in, pockets, on, the, starfish, s, aboral, surface, inside, the, pyloric, stomach, leptasterias, tenera, or, even, in, the, interior, of, the, gonads, themselves, those, starfish, that, brood, their, eggs, by, sitting, on, them, usually, assume, a, humped, posture, with, their, discs, raised, off, the, substrate, pteraster, militaris, broods, a, few, of, its, young, and, disperses, the, remaining, eggs, that, are, too, numerous, to, fit, into, its, pouch, in, these, brooding, species, the, eggs, are, relatively, large, and, supplied, with, yolk, and, they, generally, develop, directly, into, miniature, starfish, without, an, intervening, larval, stage, the, developing, young, are, called, lecithotrophic, because, they, obtain, their, nutrition, from, the, yolk, as, opposed, to, planktotrophic, larvae, that, feed, in, the, water, column, in, parvulastra, parvivipara, an, intragonadal, brooder, the, young, starfish, obtain, nutrients, by, eating, other, eggs, and, embryos, in, the, brood, pouch, brooding, is, especially, common, in, polar, and, deep, sea, species, that, live, in, environments, unfavourable, for, larval, development, and, in, smaller, species, that, produce, just, a, few, eggs, in, the, tropics, a, plentiful, supply, of, phytoplankton, is, continuously, available, for, starfish, larvae, to, feed, on, spawning, takes, place, at, any, time, of, year, each, species, having, its, own, characteristic, breeding, season, in, temperate, regions, the, spring, and, summer, brings, an, increase, in, food, supplies, the, first, individual, of, a, species, to, spawn, may, release, a, pheromone, that, serves, to, attract, other, starfish, to, aggregate, and, to, release, their, gametes, synchronously, in, other, species, a, male, and, female, may, come, together, and, form, a, pair, this, behaviour, is, called, pseudocopulation, and, the, male, climbs, on, top, placing, his, arms, between, those, of, the, female, when, she, releases, eggs, into, the, water, he, is, induced, to, spawn, starfish, may, use, environmental, signals, to, coordinate, the, time, of, spawning, day, length, to, indicate, the, correct, time, of, the, year, dawn, or, dusk, to, indicate, the, correct, time, of, day, and, chemical, signals, to, indicate, their, readiness, to, breed, in, some, species, mature, females, produce, chemicals, to, attract, sperm, in, the, sea, water, most, starfish, embryos, hatch, at, the, blastula, stage, the, original, ball, of, cells, develops, a, lateral, pouch, the, archenteron, the, entrance, to, this, is, known, as, the, blastopore, and, it, will, later, develop, into, the, anus, together, with, chordates, echinoderms, are, deuterostomes, meaning, the, second, deutero, invagination, becomes, the, mouth, stome, members, of, all, other, phyla, are, protostomes, and, their, first, invagination, becomes, the, mouth, another, invagination, of, the, surface, will, fuse, with, the, tip, of, the, archenteron, as, the, mouth, while, the, interior, section, will, become, the, gut, at, the, same, time, a, band, of, cilia, develops, on, the, exterior, this, enlarges, and, extends, around, the, surface, and, eventually, onto, two, developing, arm, like, outgrowths, at, this, stage, the, larva, is, known, as, a, bipinnaria, the, cilia, are, used, for, locomotion, and, feeding, their, rhythmic, beat, wafting, phytoplankton, towards, the, mouth, the, next, stage, in, development, is, a, brachiolaria, larva, and, involves, the, growth, of, three, short, additional, arms, these, are, at, the, anterior, end, surround, a, sucker, and, have, adhesive, cells, at, their, tips, both, bipinnaria, and, brachiolaria, larvae, are, bilaterally, symmetrical, when, fully, developed, the, brachiolaria, settles, on, the, seabed, and, attaches, itself, with, a, short, stalk, formed, from, the, ventral, arms, and, sucker, metamorphosis, now, takes, place, with, a, radical, rearrangement, of, tissues, the, left, side, of, the, larval, body, becomes, the, oral, surface, of, the, juvenile, and, the, right, side, the, aboral, surface, part, of, the, gut, is, retained, but, the, mouth, and, anus, move, to, new, positions, some, of, the, body, cavities, degenerate, but, others, become, the, water, vascular, system, and, the, visceral, coelom, the, starfish, is, now, pentaradially, symmetrical, it, casts, off, its, stalk, and, becomes, a, free, living, juvenile, starfish, about, 1, mm, 0, 04, in, in, diameter, starfish, of, the, order, paxillosida, have, no, brachiolaria, stage, with, the, bipinnaria, larvae, settling, on, the, seabed, and, developing, directly, into, juveniles, some, species, of, starfish, in, the, three, families, asterinidae, asteriidae, and, solasteridae, are, able, to, reproduce, asexually, as, adults, either, by, fission, of, their, central, discs, or, by, autotomy, of, one, or, more, of, their, arms, which, of, these, processes, occurs, depends, on, the, genus, among, starfish, that, are, able, to, regenerate, their, whole, body, from, a, single, arm, some, can, do, so, even, from, fragments, just, 1, cm, 0, 4, in, long, single, arms, that, regenerate, a, whole, individual, are, called, comet, forms, the, division, of, the, starfish, either, across, its, disc, or, at, the, base, of, the, arm, is, usually, accompanied, by, a, weakness, in, the, structure, that, provides, a, fracture, zone, the, larvae, of, several, species, of, starfish, can, reproduce, asexually, before, they, reach, maturity, they, do, this, by, autotomising, some, parts, of, their, bodies, or, by, budding, when, such, a, larva, senses, that, food, is, plentiful, it, takes, the, path, of, asexual, reproduction, rather, than, normal, development, though, this, costs, it, time, and, energy, and, delays, maturity, it, allows, a, single, larva, to, give, rise, to, multiple, adults, when, the, conditions, are, appropriate, some, species, of, starfish, have, the, ability, to, regenerate, lost, arms, and, can, regrow, an, entire, new, limb, given, time, a, few, can, regrow, a, complete, new, disc, from, a, single, arm, while, others, need, at, least, part, of, the, central, disc, to, be, attached, to, the, detached, part, regrowth, can, take, several, months, or, years, and, starfish, are, vulnerable, to, infections, during, the, early, stages, after, the, loss, of, an, arm, a, separated, limb, lives, off, stored, nutrients, until, it, regrows, a, disc, and, mouth, and, is, able, to, feed, again, other, than, fragmentation, carried, out, for, the, purpose, of, reproduction, the, division, of, the, body, may, happen, inadvertently, due, to, part, being, detached, by, a, predator, or, part, may, be, actively, shed, by, the, starfish, in, an, escape, response, the, loss, of, parts, of, the, body, is, achieved, by, the, rapid, softening, of, a, special, type, of, connective, tissue, in, response, to, nervous, signals, this, type, of, tissue, is, called, catch, connective, tissue, and, is, found, in, most, echinoderms, an, autotomy, promoting, factor, has, been, identified, which, when, injected, into, another, starfish, causes, rapid, shedding, of, arms, the, lifespan, of, a, starfish, varies, considerably, between, species, generally, being, longer, in, larger, forms, and, in, those, with, planktonic, larvae, for, example, leptasterias, hexactis, broods, a, small, number, of, large, yolked, eggs, it, has, an, adult, weight, of, 20, g, 0, 7, oz, reaches, sexual, maturity, in, two, years, and, lives, for, about, ten, years, pisaster, ochraceus, releases, a, large, number, of, eggs, into, the, sea, each, year, and, has, an, adult, weight, of, up, to, 800, g, 28, oz, it, reaches, maturity, in, five, years, and, has, a, maximum, recorded, lifespan, of, 34, years, the, average, lifespan, of, a, starfish, is, 35, years, and, larger, starfish, species, typically, live, longer, than, their, smaller, counterparts, echinoderms, including, starfish, maintain, a, delicate, internal, electrolyte, balance, that, is, in, equilibrium, with, sea, water, making, it, impossible, for, them, to, live, in, a, freshwater, habitat, starfish, species, inhabit, all, of, the, world, s, oceans, habitats, range, from, tropical, coral, reefs, rocky, shores, tidal, pools, mud, and, sand, to, kelp, forests, seagrass, meadows, and, the, deep, sea, floor, down, to, at, least, 6, 000, m, 20, 000, ft, the, greatest, diversity, of, species, occurs, in, coastal, areas, most, species, are, generalist, predators, eating, microalgae, sponges, bivalves, snails, and, other, small, animals, the, crown, of, thorns, starfish, consumes, coral, polyps, while, other, species, are, detritivores, feeding, on, decomposing, organic, material, and, faecal, matter, a, few, are, suspension, feeders, gathering, in, phytoplankton, henricia, and, echinaster, often, occur, in, association, with, sponges, benefiting, from, the, water, current, they, produce, various, species, have, been, shown, to, be, able, to, absorb, organic, nutrients, from, the, surrounding, water, and, this, may, form, a, significant, portion, of, their, diet, the, processes, of, feeding, and, capture, may, be, aided, by, special, parts, pisaster, brevispinus, the, short, spined, pisaster, from, the, west, coast, of, america, can, use, a, set, of, specialized, tube, feet, to, dig, itself, deep, into, the, soft, substrate, to, extract, prey, usually, clams, grasping, the, shellfish, the, starfish, slowly, pries, open, the, prey, s, shell, by, wearing, out, its, adductor, muscle, and, then, inserts, its, everted, stomach, into, the, crack, to, digest, the, soft, tissues, the, gap, between, the, valves, need, only, be, a, fraction, of, a, millimetre, wide, for, the, stomach, to, gain, entry, cannibalism, has, been, observed, in, juvenile, sea, stars, as, early, as, four, days, after, metamorphosis, starfish, are, keystone, species, in, their, respective, marine, communities, their, relatively, large, sizes, diverse, diets, and, ability, to, adapt, to, different, environments, makes, them, ecologically, important, the, term, keystone, species, was, in, fact, first, used, by, robert, paine, in, 1966, to, describe, a, starfish, pisaster, ochraceus, when, studying, the, low, intertidal, coasts, of, washington, state, paine, found, that, predation, by, p, ochraceus, was, a, major, factor, in, the, diversity, of, species, experimental, removals, of, this, top, predator, from, a, stretch, of, shoreline, resulted, in, lower, species, diversity, and, the, eventual, domination, of, mytilus, mussels, which, were, able, to, outcompete, other, organisms, for, space, and, resources, similar, results, were, found, in, a, 1971, study, of, stichaster, australis, on, the, intertidal, coast, of, the, south, island, of, new, zealand, s, australis, was, found, to, have, removed, most, of, a, batch, of, transplanted, mussels, within, two, or, three, months, of, their, placement, while, in, an, area, from, which, s, australis, had, been, removed, the, mussels, increased, in, number, dramatically, overwhelming, the, area, and, threatening, biodiversity, the, feeding, activity, of, the, omnivorous, starfish, oreaster, reticulatus, on, sandy, and, seagrass, bottoms, in, the, virgin, islands, appears, to, regulate, the, diversity, distribution, and, abundance, of, microorganisms, these, starfish, engulf, piles, of, sediment, removing, the, surface, films, and, algae, adhering, to, the, particles, organisms, that, dislike, this, disturbance, are, replaced, by, others, better, able, to, rapidly, recolonise, clean, sediment, in, addition, foraging, by, these, migratory, starfish, creates, diverse, patches, of, organic, matter, which, may, play, a, role, in, the, distribution, and, abundance, of, organisms, such, as, fish, crabs, and, sea, urchins, that, feed, on, the, sediment, starfish, sometimes, have, negative, effects, on, ecosystems, outbreaks, of, crown, of, thorns, starfish, have, caused, damage, to, coral, reefs, in, northeast, australia, and, french, polynesia, a, study, in, polynesia, found, that, coral, cover, declined, drastically, with, the, arrival, of, migratory, starfish, in, 2006, dropping, from, 50, to, under, 5, in, three, years, this, had, a, cascading, effect, on, the, whole, benthic, community, and, reef, feeding, fish, asterias, amurensis, is, one, of, a, few, echinoderm, invasive, species, its, larvae, likely, arrived, in, tasmania, from, central, japan, via, water, discharged, from, ships, in, the, 1980s, the, species, has, since, grown, in, numbers, to, the, point, where, they, threaten, commercially, important, bivalve, populations, as, such, they, are, considered, pests, and, are, on, the, invasive, species, specialist, group, s, list, of, the, world, s, 100, worst, invasive,

and, that, by, 2021, sea, urchins, have, destroyed, 95, of, california, s, kelp, forests, starfish, may, be, preyed, on, by, conspecifics, sea, anemones, other, starfish, species, tritons, crabs, fish, gulls, and, sea, otters, their, first, lines, of, defence, are, the, saponins, present, in, their, body, walls, which, have, unpleasant, flavours, some, starfish, such, as, astropecten, polyacanthus, also, include, powerful, toxins, such, as, tetrodotoxin, among, their, chemical, armoury, and, the, slime, star, can, ooze, out, large, quantities, of, repellent, mucus, they, also, have, body, armour, in, the, form, of, hard, plates, and, spines, the, crown, of, thorns, starfish, is, particularly, unattractive, to, potential, predators, being, heavily, defended, by, sharp, spines, laced, with, toxins, and, sometimes, with, bright, warning, colours, other, species, protect, their, vulnerable, tube, feet, and, arm, tips, by, lining, their, ambulacral, grooves, with, spines, and, heavily, plating, their, extremities, several, species, sometimes, suffer, from, a, wasting, condition, caused, by, bacteria, in, the, genus, vibrio, however, a, more, widespread, wasting, disease, causing, mass, mortalities, among, starfish, appears, sporadically, a, paper, published, in, november, 2014, revealed, the, most, likely, cause, of, this, disease, to, be, a, densovirus, the, authors, named, sea, star, associated, densovirus, ssadv, the, protozoan, orchitophrya, stellarum, is, known, to, infect, the, gonads, of, starfish, and, damage, tissue, starfish, are, vulnerable, to, high, temperatures, experiments, have, shown, that, the, feeding, and, growth, rates, of, p, ochraceus, reduce, greatly, when, their, body, temperatures, rise, above, 23, c, 73, f, and, that, they, die, when, their, temperature, rises, to, 30, c, 86, f, this, species, has, a, unique, ability, to, absorb, seawater, to, keep, itself, cool, when, it, is, exposed, to, sunlight, by, a, receding, tide, it, also, appears, to, rely, on, its, arms, to, absorb, heat, so, as, to, protect, the, central, disc, and, vital, organs, like, the, stomach, starfish, and, other, echinoderms, are, sensitive, to, marine, pollution, the, common, starfish, is, considered, to, be, a, bioindicator, for, marine, ecosystems, a, 2009, study, found, that, p, ochraceus, is, unlikely, to, be, affected, by, ocean, acidification, as, severely, as, other, marine, animals, with, calcareous, skeletons, in, other, groups, structures, made, of, calcium, carbonate, are, vulnerable, to, dissolution, when, the, ph, is, lowered, researchers, found, that, when, p, ochraceus, were, exposed, to, 21, c, 70, f, and, 770, ppm, carbon, dioxide, beyond, rises, expected, in, the, next, century, they, were, relatively, unaffected, their, survival, is, likely, due, to, the, nodular, nature, of, their, skeletons, which, are, able, to, compensate, for, a, shortage, of, carbonate, by, growing, more, fleshy, tissue, echinoderms, first, appeared, in, the, fossil, record, in, the, cambrian, the, first, known, asterozoans, were, the, somasteroidea, which, exhibit, characteristics, of, both, groups, starfish, are, infrequently, found, as, fossils, possibly, because, their, hard, skeletal, components, separate, as, the, animal, decays, despite, this, there, are, a, few, places, where, accumulations, of, complete, skeletal, structures, occur, fossilized, in, place, in, lagerst, tten, so, called, starfish, beds, by, the, late, paleozoic, the, crinoids, and, blastoids, were, the, predominant, echinoderms, and, some, limestones, from, this, period, are, made, almost, entirely, from, fragments, from, these, groups, in, the, two, major, extinction, events, that, occurred, during, the, late, devonian, and, late, permian, the, blastoids, were, wiped, out, and, only, a, few, species, of, crinoids, survived, many, starfish, species, also, became, extinct, in, these, events, but, afterwards, the, surviving, few, species, diversified, rapidly, within, about, sixty, million, years, during, the, early, jurassic, and, the, beginning, of, the, middle, jurassic, a, 2012, study, found, that, speciation, in, starfish, can, occur, rapidly, during, the, last, 6, 000, years, divergence, in, the, larval, development, of, cryptasterina, hystera, and, cryptasterina, pentagona, has, taken, place, the, former, adopting, internal, fertilization, and, brooding, and, the, latter, remaining, a, broadcast, spawner, the, scientific, name, asteroidea, was, given, to, starfish, by, the, french, zoologist, de, blainville, in, 1830, it, is, derived, from, the, greek, aster, a, star, and, the, greek, eidos, form, likeness, appearance, the, class, asteroidea, belongs, to, the, phylum, echinodermata, as, well, as, the, starfish, the, echinoderms, include, sea, urchins, sand, dollars, brittle, and, basket, stars, sea, cucumbers, and, crinoids, the, larvae, of, echinoderms, have, bilateral, symmetry, but, during, metamorphosis, this, is, replaced, with, radial, symmetry, typically, pentameric, adult, echinoderms, are, characterized, by, having, a, water, vascular, system, with, external, tube, feet, and, a, calcareous, endoskeleton, consisting, of, ossicles, connected, by, a, mesh, of, collagen, fibres, starfish, are, included, in, the, subphylum, asterozoa, the, characteristics, of, which, include, a, flattened, star, shaped, body, as, adults, consisting, of, a, central, disc, and, multiple, radiating, arms, the, subphylum, includes, the, two, classes, of, asteroidea, the, starfish, and, ophiuroidea, the, brittle, stars, and, basket, stars, asteroids, have, broad, based, arms, with, skeletal, support, provided, by, calcareous, plates, in, the, body, wall, while, ophiuroids, have, clearly, demarcated, slender, arms, strengthened, by, paired, fused, ossicles, forming, jointed, vertebrae, the, starfish, are, a, large, and, diverse, class, with, over, 1, 900, living, species, there, are, seven, extant, orders, brisingida, forcipulatida, notomyotida, paxillosida, spinulosida, valvatida, and, velatida, and, two, extinct, ones, calliasterellidae, and, trichasteropsida, living, asteroids, the, neoasteroidea, are, morphologically, distinct, from, their, forerunners, in, the, paleozoic, the, taxonomy, of, the, group, is, relatively, stable, but, there, is, ongoing, debate, about, the, status, of, the, paxillosida, and, the, deep, water, sea, daisies, though, clearly, asteroidea, and, currently, included, in, velatida, do, not, fit, easily, in, any, accepted, lineage, phylogenetic, data, suggests, that, they, may, be, a, sister, group, the, concentricycloidea, to, the, neoasteroidea, or, that, the, velatida, themselves, may, be, a, sister, group, extinct, groups, within, the, asteroidea, include, starfish, are, deuterostome, animals, like, the, chordates, a, 2014, analysis, of, 219, genes, from, all, classes, of, echinoderms, gives, the, following, phylogenetic, tree, the, times, at, which, the, clades, diverged, are, shown, under, the, labels, in, millions, of, years, ago, mya, xenacoelomorpha, chordata, holothuroidea, echinoidea, ophiuroidea, asteroidea, crinoidea, ecdysozoa, spiralia, the, phylogeny, of, the, asteroidea, has, been, difficult, to, resolve, with, visible, morphological, features, proving, inadequate, and, the, question, of, whether, traditional, taxa, are, clades, in, doubt, the, phylogeny, proposed, by, gale, in, 1987, is, palaeozoic, asteroids, paxillosida, valvatida, including, velatida, spinulosida, not, a, clade, forcipulatida, including, brisingida, the, phylogeny, proposed, by, blake, in, 1987, is, palaeozoic, asteroids, calliasterellidae, compasteridae, trichasteropsida, brisingida, forcipulatida, spinulosida, velatida, notomyotida, valvatida, paxillosida, later, work, making, use, of, molecular, evidence, with, or, without, the, use, of, morphological, evidence, had, by, 2000, failed, to, resolve, the, argument, in, 2011, on, further, molecular, evidence, janies, and, colleagues, noted, that, the, phylogeny, of, the, echinoderms, has, proven, difficult, and, that, the, overall, phylogeny, of, extant, echinoderms, remains, sensitive, to, the, choice, of, analytical, methods, they, presented, a, phylogenetic, tree, for, the, living, asteroidea, only, using, the, traditional, names, of, starfish, orders, where, possible, and, indicating, part, of, otherwise, the, phylogeny, is, shown, below, the, solasteridae, are, split, from, the, velatida, and, the, old, spinulosida, is, broken, up, solasteridae, and, part, of, spinulosida, e, g, stegnaster, and, part, of, valvatida, e, g, asterina, odontasteridae, which, was, a, part, of, valvatida, paxillosida, part, of, spinulosida, e, g, echinaster, part, of, valvatida, e, g, archaster, forcipulatida, brisingida, with, part, of, velatida, e, g, caymanostella, and, part, of, forcipulatida, e, g, stichaster, velatida, except, for, solasteridae, notomyotida, not, analysed, starfish, are, deuterostomes, closely, related, together, with, all, other, echinoderms, to, chordates, and, are, used, in, reproductive, and, developmental, studies, female, starfish, produce, large, numbers, of, oocytes, that, are, easily, isolated, these, can, be, stored, in, a, pre, meiosis, phase, and, stimulated, to, complete, division, by, the, use, of, 1, methyladenine, starfish, oocytes, are, well, suited, for, this, research, as, they, are, large, and, easy, to, handle, transparent, simple, to, maintain, in, sea, water, at, room, temperature, and, they, develop, rapidly, asterina, pectinifera, used, as, a, model, organism, for, this, purpose, is, resilient, and, easy, to, breed, and, maintain, in, the, laboratory, another, area, of, research, is, the, ability, of, starfish, to, regenerate, lost, body, parts, the, stem, cells, of, adult, humans, are, incapable, of, much, differentiation, and, understanding, the, regrowth, repair, and, cloning, processes, in, starfish, may, have, implications, for, human, medicine, starfish, also, have, an, unusual, ability, to, expel, foreign, objects, from, their, bodies, which, makes, them, difficult, to, tag, for, research, tracking, purposes, an, aboriginal, australian, fable, retold, by, the, welsh, school, headmaster, william, jenkyn, thomas, 1870, 1959, tells, how, some, animals, needed, a, canoe, to, cross, the, ocean, whale, had, one, but, refused, to, lend, it, so, starfish, kept, him, busy, telling, him, stories, and, grooming, him, to, remove, parasites, while, the, others, stole, the, canoe, when, whale, realized, the, trick, he, beat, starfish, ragged, which, is, how, starfish, still, is, today, in, 1900, the, scholar, edward, tregear, documented, the, creation, song, which, he, describes, as, an, ancient, prayer, for, the, dedication, of, a, high, chief, of, hawaii, among, the, uncreated, gods, described, early, in, the, song, are, the, male, kumulipo, creation, and, the, female, poele, both, born, in, the, night, a, coral, insect, the, earthworm, and, the, starfish, georg, eberhard, rumpf, s, 1705, the, ambonese, curiosity, cabinet, describes, the, tropical, varieties, of, stella, marina, or, bintang, laut, sea, star, in, latin, and, malay, respectively, known, in, the, waters, around, ambon, he, writes, that, the, histoire, des, antilles, reports, that, when, the, sea, stars, see, thunder, storms, approaching, grab, hold, of, many,

addison, wrote, a, non, fiction, book, titled, starfish, a, year, in, the, life, of, bereavement, and, depression, the, starfish, and, the, spider, is, a, 2006, business, management, book, by, ori, brafman, and, rod, beckstrom, its, title, alludes, to, the, ability, of, the, starfish, to, regenerate, itself, because, of, its, decentralized, nervous, system, and, the, book, suggests, ways, that, a, decentralized, organisation, may, flourish, in, the, nickelodeon, animated, television, series, spongebob, squarepants, the, eponymous, character, s, best, friend, is, a, dim, witted, starfish, patrick, star, starfish, are, widespread, in, the, oceans, but, are, only, occasionally, used, as, food, there, may, be, good, reason, for, this, the, bodies, of, numerous, species, are, dominated, by, bony, ossicles, and, the, body, wall, of, many, species, contains, saponins, which, have, an, unpleasant, taste, and, others, contain, tetrodotoxins, which, are, poisonous, some, species, that, prey, on, bivalve, molluscs, can, transmit, paralytic, shellfish, poisoning, georg, eberhard, rumpf, found, few, starfish, being, used, for, food, in, the, indonesian, archipelago, other, than, as, bait, in, fish, traps, but, on, the, island, of, huamobel, the, people, cut, them, up, squeeze, out, the, black, blood, and, cook, them, with, sour, tamarind, leaves, after, resting, the, pieces, for, a, day, or, two, they, remove, the, outer, skin, and, cook, them, in, coconut, milk, starfish, are, sometimes, eaten, in, china, japan, and, in, micronesia, starfish, are, in, some, cases, taken, from, their, habitat, and, sold, to, tourists, as, souvenirs, ornaments, curios, or, for, display, in, aquariums, in, particular, oreaster, reticulatus, with, its, easily, accessed, habitat, and, conspicuous, coloration, is, widely, collected, in, the, caribbean, in, the, early, to, mid, 20th, century, this, species, was, common, along, the, coasts, of, the, west, indies, but, collection, and, trade, have, severely, reduced, its, numbers, in, the, state, of, florida, o, reticulatus, is, listed, as, endangered, and, its, collection, is, illegal, nevertheless, it, is, still, sold, throughout, its, range, and, beyond, a, similar, phenomenon, exists, in, the, indo, pacific, for, species, such, as, protoreaster, nodosus, with, its, multiple, arms, the, starfish, provides, a, popular,
