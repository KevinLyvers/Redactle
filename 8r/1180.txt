escherichia, coli, r, k, i, k, o, l, a, esh, rik, ee, koh, lye, is, a, gram, negative, facultative, anaerobic, rod, shaped, coliform, bacterium, of, the, genus, escherichia, that, is, commonly, found, in, the, lower, intestine, of, warm, blooded, organisms, most, e, coli, strains, are, harmless, but, some, serotypes, such, as, epec, and, etec, are, pathogenic, and, can, cause, serious, food, poisoning, in, their, hosts, and, are, occasionally, responsible, for, food, contamination, incidents, that, prompt, product, recalls, most, strains, are, part, of, the, normal, microbiota, of, the, gut, and, are, harmless, or, even, beneficial, to, humans, although, these, strains, tend, to, be, less, studied, than, the, pathogenic, ones, for, example, some, strains, of, e, coli, benefit, their, hosts, by, producing, vitamin, k, 2, or, by, preventing, the, colonization, of, the, intestine, by, pathogenic, bacteria, these, mutually, beneficial, relationships, between, e, coli, and, humans, are, a, type, of, mutualistic, biological, relationship, where, both, the, humans, and, the, e, coli, are, benefitting, each, other, e, coli, is, expelled, into, the, environment, within, fecal, matter, the, bacterium, grows, massively, in, fresh, fecal, matter, under, aerobic, conditions, for, three, days, but, its, numbers, decline, slowly, afterwards, e, coli, and, other, facultative, anaerobes, constitute, about, 0, 1, of, gut, microbiota, and, fecal, oral, transmission, is, the, major, route, through, which, pathogenic, strains, of, the, bacterium, cause, disease, cells, are, able, to, survive, outside, the, body, for, a, limited, amount, of, time, which, makes, them, potential, indicator, organisms, to, test, environmental, samples, for, fecal, contamination, a, growing, body, of, research, though, has, examined, environmentally, persistent, e, coli, which, can, survive, for, many, days, and, grow, outside, a, host, the, bacterium, can, be, grown, and, cultured, easily, and, inexpensively, in, a, laboratory, setting, and, has, been, intensively, investigated, for, over, 60, years, e, coli, is, a, chemoheterotroph, whose, chemically, defined, medium, must, include, a, source, of, carbon, and, energy, e, coli, is, the, most, widely, studied, prokaryotic, model, organism, and, an, important, species, in, the, fields, of, biotechnology, and, microbiology, where, it, has, served, as, the, host, organism, for, the, majority, of, work, with, recombinant, dna, under, favourable, conditions, it, takes, as, little, as, 20, minutes, to, reproduce, e, coli, is, a, gram, negative, facultative, anaerobe, nonsporulating, coliform, bacterium, cells, are, typically, rod, shaped, and, are, about, 2, 0, m, long, and, 0, 25, 1, 0, m, in, diameter, with, a, cell, volume, of, 0, 6, 0, 7, m, 3, e, coli, stains, gram, negative, because, its, cell, wall, is, composed, of, a, thin, peptidoglycan, layer, and, an, outer, membrane, during, the, staining, process, e, coli, picks, up, the, color, of, the, counterstain, safranin, and, stains, pink, the, outer, membrane, surrounding, the, cell, wall, provides, a, barrier, to, certain, antibiotics, such, that, e, coli, is, not, damaged, by, penicillin, the, flagella, which, allow, the, bacteria, to, swim, have, a, peritrichous, arrangement, it, also, attaches, and, effaces, to, the, microvilli, of, the, intestines, via, an, adhesion, molecule, known, as, intimin, e, coli, can, live, on, a, wide, variety, of, substrates, and, uses, mixed, acid, fermentation, in, anaerobic, conditions, producing, lactate, succinate, ethanol, acetate, and, carbon, dioxide, since, many, pathways, in, mixed, acid, fermentation, produce, hydrogen, gas, these, pathways, require, the, levels, of, hydrogen, to, be, low, as, is, the, case, when, e, coli, lives, together, with, hydrogen, consuming, organisms, such, as, methanogens, or, sulphate, reducing, bacteria, in, addition, e, coli, s, metabolism, can, be, rewired, to, solely, use, co, 2, as, the, source, of, carbon, for, biomass, production, in, other, words, this, obligate, heterotroph, s, metabolism, can, be, altered, to, display, autotrophic, capabilities, by, heterologously, expressing, carbon, fixation, genes, as, well, as, formate, dehydrogenase, and, conducting, laboratory, evolution, experiments, this, may, be, done, by, using, formate, to, reduce, electron, carriers, and, supply, the, atp, required, in, anabolic, pathways, inside, of, these, synthetic, autotrophs, e, coli, has, three, native, glycolytic, pathways, empp, edp, and, oppp, the, empp, employs, ten, enzymatic, steps, to, yield, two, pyruvates, two, atp, and, two, nadh, per, glucose, molecule, while, oppp, serves, as, an, oxidation, route, for, nadph, synthesis, although, the, edp, is, the, more, thermodynamically, favourable, of, the, three, pathways, e, coli, do, not, use, the, edp, for, glucose, metabolism, relying, mainly, on, the, empp, and, the, oppp, the, edp, mainly, remains, inactive, except, for, during, growth, with, gluconate, when, growing, in, the, presence, of, a, mixture, of, sugars, bacteria, will, often, consume, the, sugars, sequentially, through, a, process, known, as, catabolite, repression, by, repressing, the, expression, of, the, genes, involved, in, metabolizing, the, less, preferred, sugars, cells, will, usually, first, consume, the, sugar, yielding, the, highest, growth, rate, followed, by, the, sugar, yielding, the, next, highest, growth, rate, and, so, on, in, doing, so, the, cells, ensure, that, their, limited, metabolic, resources, are, being, used, to, maximize, the, rate, of, growth, the, well, used, example, of, this, with, e, coli, involves, the, growth, of, the, bacterium, on, glucose, and, lactose, where, e, coli, will, consume, glucose, before, lactose, catabolite, repression, has, also, been, observed, in, e, coli, in, the, presence, of, other, non, glucose, sugars, such, as, arabinose, and, xylose, sorbitol, rhamnose, and, ribose, in, e, coli, glucose, catabolite, repression, is, regulated, by, the, phosphotransferase, system, a, multi, protein, phosphorylation, cascade, that, couples, glucose, uptake, and, metabolism, optimum, growth, of, e, coli, occurs, at, 37, c, 99, f, but, some, laboratory, strains, can, multiply, at, temperatures, up, to, 49, c, 120, f, e, coli, grows, in, a, variety, of, defined, laboratory, media, such, as, lysogeny, broth, or, any, medium, that, contains, glucose, ammonium, phosphate, monobasic, sodium, chloride, magnesium, sulfate, potassium, phosphate, dibasic, and, water, growth, can, be, driven, by, aerobic, or, anaerobic, respiration, using, a, large, variety, of, redox, pairs, including, the, oxidation, of, pyruvic, acid, formic, acid, hydrogen, and, amino, acids, and, the, reduction, of, substrates, such, as, oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl, sulfoxide, and, trimethylamine, n, oxide, e, coli, is, classified, as, a, facultative, anaerobe, it, uses, oxygen, when, it, is, present, and, available, it, can, however, continue, to, grow, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, using, fermentation, or, anaerobic, respiration, respiration, type, is, managed, in, part, by, the, arc, system, the, ability, to, continue, growing, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, is, an, advantage, to, bacteria, because, their, survival, is, increased, in, environments, where, water, predominates, the, bacterial, cell, cycle, is, divided, into, three, stages, the, b, period, occurs, between, the, completion, of, cell, division, and, the, beginning, of, dna, replication, the, c, period, encompasses, the, time, it, takes, to, replicate, the, chromosomal, dna, the, d, period, refers, to, the, stage, between, the, conclusion, of, dna, replication, and, the, end, of, cell, division, the, doubling, rate, of, e, coli, is, higher, when, more, nutrients, are, available, however, the, length, of, the, c, and, d, periods, do, not, change, even, when, the, doubling, time, becomes, less, than, the, sum, of, the, c, and, d, periods, at, the, fastest, growth, rates, replication, begins, before, the, previous, round, of, replication, has, completed, resulting, in, multiple, replication, forks, along, the, dna, and, overlapping, cell, cycles, the, number, of, replication, forks, in, fast, growing, e, coli, typically, follows, 2n, n, 1, 2, or, 3, this, only, happens, if, replication, is, initiated, simultaneously, from, all, origins, of, replications, and, is, referred, to, as, synchronous, replication, however, not, all, cells, in, a, culture, replicate, synchronously, in, this, case, cells, do, not, have, multiples, of, two, replication, forks, replication, initiation, is, then, referred, to, being, asynchronous, however, asynchrony, can, be, caused, by, mutations, to, for, instance, dnaa, or, dnaa, initiator, associating, protein, diaa, although, e, coli, reproduces, by, binary, fission, the, two, supposedly, identical, cells, produced, by, cell, division, are, functionally, asymmetric, with, the, old, pole, cell, acting, as, an, aging, parent, that, repeatedly, produces, rejuvenated, offspring, when, exposed, to, an, elevated, stress, level, damage, accumulation, in, an, old, e, coli, lineage, may, surpass, its, immortality, threshold, so, that, it, arrests, division, and, becomes, mortal, cellular, aging, is, a, general, process, affecting, prokaryotes, and, eukaryotes, alike, e, coli, and, related, bacteria, possess, the, ability, to, transfer, dna, via, bacterial, conjugation, or, transduction, which, allows, genetic, material, to, spread, horizontally, through, an, existing, population, the, process, of, transduction, which, uses, the, bacterial, virus, called, a, bacteriophage, is, where, the, spread, of, the, gene, encoding, for, the, shiga, toxin, from, the, shigella, bacteria, to, e, coli, helped, produce, e, coli, o157, h7, the, shiga, toxin, producing, strain, of, e, coli, e, coli, encompasses, an, enormous, population, of, bacteria, that, exhibit, a, very, high, degree, of, both, genetic, and, phenotypic, diversity, genome, sequencing, of, many, isolates, of, e, coli, and, related, bacteria, shows, that, a, taxonomic, reclassification, would, be, desirable, however, this, has, not, been, done, largely, due, to, its, medical, importance, and, e, coli, remains, one, of, the, most, diverse, bacterial, species, only, 20, of, the, genes, in, a, typical, e, coli, genome, is, shared, among, all, strains, in, fact, from, the, more, constructive, point, of, view, the, members, of, genus, shigella, s, dysenteriae, s, flexneri, s, boydii, and, s, sonnei, should, be, classified, as, e, coli, strains, a, phenomenon, termed, taxa, in, disguise, similarly, other, strains, of, e, coli, e, g, the, k, 12, strain, commonly, used, in, recombinant, dna, work, are, sufficiently, different, that, they, would, merit, reclassification, a, strain, is, a, subgroup, within, the, species, that, has, unique, characteristics, that, distinguish, it, from, other, strains, these, differences, are, often, detectable, only, at, the, molecular, level, however, they, may, result, in, changes, to, the, physiology, or, lifecycle, of, the, bacterium, for, example, a, strain, may, gain, pathogenic, capacity, the, ability, to, use, a, unique, carbon, source, the, ability, to, take, upon, a, particular, ecological, niche, or, the, ability, to, resist, antimicrobial, agents, different, strains, of, e, coli, are, often, host, specific, making, it, possible, to, determine, the, source, of, fecal, contamination, in, environmental, samples, for, example, knowing, which, e, coli, strains, are, present, in, a, water, sample, allows, researchers, to, make, assumptions, about, whether, the, contamination, originated, from, a, human, another, mammal, or, a, bird, a, common, subdivision, system, of, e, coli, but, not, based, on, evolutionary, relatedness, is, by, serotype, which, is, based, on, major, surface, antigens, o, antigen, part, of, lipopolysaccharide, layer, h, flagellin, k, antigen, capsule, e, g, o157, h7, it, is, however, common, to, cite, only, the, serogroup, i, e, the, o, antigen, at, present, about, 190, serogroups, are, known, the, common, laboratory, strain, has, a, mutation, that, prevents, the, formation, of, an, o, antigen, and, is, thus, not, typeable, like, all, lifeforms, new, strains, of, e, coli, evolve, through, the, natural, biological, processes, of, mutation, gene, duplication, and, horizontal, gene, transfer, in, particular, 18, of, the, genome, of, the, laboratory, strain, mg1655, was, horizontally, acquired, since, the, divergence, from, salmonella, e, coli, k, 12, and, e, coli, b, strains, are, the, most, frequently, used, varieties, for, laboratory, purposes, some, strains, develop, traits, that, can, be, harmful, to, a, host, animal, these, virulent, strains, typically, cause, a, bout, of, diarrhea, that, is, often, self, limiting, in, healthy, adults, but, is, frequently, lethal, to, children, in, the, developing, world, more, virulent, strains, such, as, o157, h7, cause, serious, illness, or, death, in, the, elderly, the, very, young, or, the, immunocompromised, the, genera, escherichia, and, salmonella, diverged, around, 102, million, years, ago, credibility, interval, 57, 176, mya, an, event, unrelated, to, the, much, earlier, see, synapsid, divergence, of, their, hosts, the, former, being, found, in, mammals, and, the, latter, in, birds, and, reptiles, this, was, followed, by, a, split, of, an, escherichia, ancestor, into, five, species, e, albertii, e, coli, e, fergusonii, e, hermannii, and, e, vulneris, the, last, e, coli, ancestor, split, between, 20, and, 30, million, years, ago, the, long, term, evolution, experiments, using, e, coli, begun, by, richard, lenski, in, 1988, have, allowed, direct, observation, of, genome, evolution, over, more, than, 65, 000, generations, in, the, laboratory, for, instance, e, coli, typically, do, not, have, the, ability, to, grow, aerobically, with, citrate, as, a, carbon, source, which, is, used, as, a, diagnostic, criterion, with, which, to, differentiate, e, coli, from, other, closely, related, bacteria, such, as, salmonella, in, this, experiment, one, population, of, e, coli, unexpectedly, evolved, the, ability, to, aerobically, metabolize, citrate, a, major, evolutionary, shift, with, some, hallmarks, of, microbial, speciation, in, the, microbial, world, a, relationship, of, predation, can, be, established, similar, to, that, observed, in, the, animal, world, considered, it, has, been, seen, that, e, coli, is, the, prey, of, multiple, generalist, predators, such, as, myxococcus, xanthus, in, this, predator, prey, relationship, a, parallel, evolution, of, both, species, is, observed, through, genomic, and, phenotypic, modifications, in, the, case, of, e, coli, the, modifications, are, modified, in, two, aspects, involved, in, their, virulence, such, as, mucoid, production, excessive, production, of, exoplasmic, acid, alginate, and, the, suppression, of, the, ompt, gene, producing, in, future, generations, a, better, adaptation, of, one, of, the, species, that, is, counteracted, by, the, evolution, of, the, other, following, a, co, evolutionary, model, demonstrated, by, the, red, queen, hypothesis, e, coli, is, the, type, species, of, the, genus, escherichia, and, in, turn, escherichia, is, the, type, genus, of, the, family, enterobacteriaceae, where, the, family, name, does, not, stem, from, the, genus, enterobacter, i, sic, aceae, but, from, enterobacterium, aceae, enterobacterium, being, not, a, genus, but, an, alternative, trivial, name, to, enteric, bacterium, the, original, strain, described, by, escherich, is, believed, to, be, lost, consequently, a, new, type, strain, neotype, was, chosen, as, a, representative, the, neotype, strain, is, u5, 41, t, also, known, under, the, deposit, names, dsm, 30083, atcc, 11775, and, nctc, 9001, which, is, pathogenic, to, chickens, and, has, an, o1, k1, h7, serotype, however, in, most, studies, either, o157, h7, k, 12, mg1655, or, k, 12, w3110, were, used, as, a, representative, e, coli, the, genome, of, the, type, strain, has, only, lately, been, sequenced, many, strains, belonging, to, this, species, have, been, isolated, and, characterised, in, addition, to, serotype, vide, supra, they, can, be, classified, according, to, their, phylogeny, i, e, the, inferred, evolutionary, history, as, shown, below, where, the, species, is, divided, into, six, groups, as, of, 2014, particularly, the, use, of, whole, genome, sequences, yields, highly, supported, phylogenies, the, phylogroup, structure, remains, robust, to, newer, methods, and, sequences, which, sometimes, adds, newer, groups, giving, 8, or, 14, as, of, 2023, the, link, between, phylogenetic, distance, relatedness, and, pathology, is, small, e, g, the, o157, h7, serotype, strains, which, form, a, clade, an, exclusive, group, group, e, below, are, all, enterohaemorragic, strains, ehec, but, not, all, ehec, strains, are, closely, related, in, fact, four, different, species, of, shigella, are, nested, among, e, coli, strains, vide, supra, while, e, albertii, and, e, fergusonii, are, outside, this, group, indeed, all, shigella, species, were, placed, within, a, single, subspecies, of, e, coli, in, a, phylogenomic, study, that, included, the, type, strain, all, commonly, used, research, strains, of, e, coli, belong, to, group, a, and, are, derived, mainly, from, clifton, s, k, 12, strain, f, o16, and, to, a, lesser, degree, from, d, herelle, s, bacillus, coli, strain, b, strain, o7, there, have, been, multiple, proposals, to, revise, the, taxonomy, to, match, phylogeny, however, all, these, proposals, need, to, face, the, fact, that, shigella, remains, a, widely, used, name, in, medicine, and, find, ways, to, reduce, any, confusion, that, can, stem, from, renaming, salmonella, enterica, e, albertii, e, fergusonii, e, coli, se15, o150, h5, commensal, e, coli,

into, 2584, operons, seven, ribosomal, rna, rrna, operons, and, 86, transfer, rna, trna, genes, despite, having, been, the, subject, of, intensive, genetic, analysis, for, about, 40, years, many, of, these, genes, were, previously, unknown, the, coding, density, was, found, to, be, very, high, with, a, mean, distance, between, genes, of, only, 118, base, pairs, the, genome, was, observed, to, contain, a, significant, number, of, transposable, genetic, elements, repeat, elements, cryptic, prophages, and, bacteriophage, remnants, most, genes, have, only, a, single, copy, more, than, three, hundred, complete, genomic, sequences, of, escherichia, and, shigella, species, are, known, the, genome, sequence, of, the, type, strain, of, e, coli, was, added, to, this, collection, before, 2014, comparison, of, these, sequences, shows, a, remarkable, amount, of, diversity, only, about, 20, of, each, genome, represents, sequences, present, in, every, one, of, the, isolates, while, around, 80, of, each, genome, can, vary, among, isolates, each, individual, genome, contains, between, 4, 000, and, 5, 500, genes, but, the, total, number, of, different, genes, among, all, of, the, sequenced, e, coli, strains, the, pangenome, exceeds, 16, 000, this, very, large, variety, of, component, genes, has, been, interpreted, to, mean, that, two, thirds, of, the, e, coli, pangenome, originated, in, other, species, and, arrived, through, the, process, of, horizontal, gene, transfer, genes, in, e, coli, are, usually, named, in, accordance, with, the, uniform, nomenclature, proposed, by, demerec, et, al, gene, names, are, 3, letter, acronyms, that, derive, from, their, function, when, known, or, mutant, phenotype, and, are, italicized, when, multiple, genes, have, the, same, acronym, the, different, genes, are, designated, by, a, capital, later, that, follows, the, acronym, and, is, also, italicized, for, instance, reca, is, named, after, its, role, in, homologous, recombination, plus, the, letter, a, functionally, related, genes, are, named, recb, recc, recd, etc, the, proteins, are, named, by, uppercase, acronyms, e, g, reca, recb, etc, when, the, genome, of, e, coli, strain, k, 12, substr, mg1655, was, sequenced, all, known, or, predicted, protein, coding, genes, were, numbered, more, or, less, in, their, order, on, the, genome, and, abbreviated, by, b, numbers, such, as, b2819, recd, the, b, names, were, created, after, fred, b, lattner, who, led, the, genome, sequence, effort, another, numbering, system, was, introduced, with, the, sequence, of, another, e, coli, k, 12, substrain, w3110, which, was, sequenced, in, japan, and, hence, uses, numbers, starting, by, jw, j, apanese, w, 3110, e, g, jw2787, recd, hence, recd, b2819, jw2787, note, however, that, most, databases, have, their, own, numbering, system, e, g, the, ecogene, database, uses, eg10826, for, recd, finally, eck, numbers, are, specifically, used, for, alleles, in, the, mg1655, strain, of, e, coli, k, 12, complete, lists, of, genes, and, their, synonyms, can, be, obtained, from, databases, such, as, ecogene, or, uniprot, the, genome, sequence, of, e, coli, predicts, 4288, protein, coding, genes, of, which, 38, percent, initially, had, no, attributed, function, comparison, with, five, other, sequenced, microbes, reveals, ubiquitous, as, well, as, narrowly, distributed, gene, families, many, families, of, similar, genes, within, e, coli, are, also, evident, the, largest, family, of, paralogous, proteins, contains, 80, abc, transporters, the, genome, as, a, whole, is, strikingly, organized, with, respect, to, the, local, direction, of, replication, guanines, oligonucleotides, possibly, related, to, replication, and, recombination, and, most, genes, are, so, oriented, the, genome, also, contains, insertion, sequence, is, elements, phage, remnants, and, many, other, patches, of, unusual, composition, indicating, genome, plasticity, through, horizontal, transfer, several, studies, have, experimentally, investigated, the, proteome, of, e, coli, by, 2006, 1, 627, 38, of, the, predicted, proteins, open, reading, frames, orfs, had, been, identified, experimentally, mateus, et, al, 2020, detected, 2, 586, proteins, with, at, least, 2, peptides, 60, of, all, proteins, although, much, fewer, bacterial, proteins, seem, to, have, post, translational, modifications, ptms, compared, to, eukaryotic, proteins, a, substantial, number, of, proteins, are, modified, in, e, coli, for, instance, potel, et, al, 2018, found, 227, phosphoproteins, of, which, 173, were, phosphorylated, on, histidine, interestingly, the, majority, of, phosphorylated, amino, acids, were, serine, 1, 220, sites, with, only, 246, sites, on, histidine, and, 501, phosphorylated, threonines, and, 162, tyrosines, the, interactome, of, e, coli, has, been, studied, by, affinity, purification, and, mass, spectrometry, ap, ms, and, by, analyzing, the, binary, interactions, among, its, proteins, protein, complexes, a, 2006, study, purified, 4, 339, proteins, from, cultures, of, strain, k, 12, and, found, interacting, partners, for, 2, 667, proteins, many, of, which, had, unknown, functions, at, the, time, a, 2009, study, found, 5, 993, interactions, between, proteins, of, the, same, e, coli, strain, though, these, data, showed, little, overlap, with, those, of, the, 2006, publication, binary, interactions, rajagopala, et, al, 2014, have, carried, out, systematic, yeast, two, hybrid, screens, with, most, e, coli, proteins, and, found, a, total, of, 2, 234, protein, protein, interactions, this, study, also, integrated, genetic, interactions, and, protein, structures, and, mapped, 458, interactions, within, 227, protein, complexes, e, coli, belongs, to, a, group, of, bacteria, informally, known, as, coliforms, that, are, found, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, of, warm, blooded, animals, e, coli, normally, colonizes, an, infant, s, gastrointestinal, tract, within, 40, hours, of, birth, arriving, with, food, or, water, or, from, the, individuals, handling, the, child, in, the, bowel, e, coli, adheres, to, the, mucus, of, the, large, intestine, it, is, the, primary, facultative, anaerobe, of, the, human, gastrointestinal, tract, facultative, anaerobes, are, organisms, that, can, grow, in, either, the, presence, or, absence, of, oxygen, as, long, as, these, bacteria, do, not, acquire, genetic, elements, encoding, for, virulence, factors, they, remain, benign, commensals, due, to, the, low, cost, and, speed, with, which, it, can, be, grown, and, modified, in, laboratory, settings, e, coli, is, a, popular, expression, platform, for, the, production, of, recombinant, proteins, used, in, therapeutics, one, advantage, to, using, e, coli, over, another, expression, platform, is, that, e, coli, naturally, does, not, export, many, proteins, into, the, periplasm, making, it, easier, to, recover, a, protein, of, interest, without, cross, contamination, the, e, coli, k, 12, strains, and, their, derivatives, dh1, dh5, mg1655, rv308, and, w3110, are, the, strains, most, widely, used, by, the, biotechnology, industry, nonpathogenic, e, coli, strain, nissle, 1917, ecn, mutaflor, and, e, coli, o83, k24, h31, colinfant, are, used, as, probiotic, agents, in, medicine, mainly, for, the, treatment, of, various, gastrointestinal, diseases, including, inflammatory, bowel, disease, it, is, thought, that, the, ecn, strain, might, impede, the, growth, of, opportunistic, pathogens, including, salmonella, and, other, coliform, enteropathogens, through, the, production, of, microcin, proteins, the, production, of, siderophores, most, e, coli, strains, do, not, cause, disease, naturally, living, in, the, gut, but, virulent, strains, can, cause, gastroenteritis, urinary, tract, infections, neonatal, meningitis, hemorrhagic, colitis, and, crohn, s, disease, common, signs, and, symptoms, include, severe, abdominal, cramps, diarrhea, hemorrhagic, colitis, vomiting, and, sometimes, fever, in, rarer, cases, virulent, strains, are, also, responsible, for, bowel, necrosis, tissue, death, and, perforation, without, progressing, to, hemolytic, uremic, syndrome, peritonitis, mastitis, sepsis, and, gram, negative, pneumonia, very, young, children, are, more, susceptible, to, develop, severe, illness, such, as, hemolytic, uremic, syndrome, however, healthy, individuals, of, all, ages, are, at, risk, to, the, severe, consequences, that, may, arise, as, a, result, of, being, infected, with, e, coli, some, strains, of, e, coli, for, example, o157, h7, can, produce, shiga, toxin, the, shiga, toxin, causes, inflammatory, responses, in, target, cells, of, the, gut, leaving, behind, lesions, which, result, in, the, bloody, diarrhea, that, is, a, symptom, of, a, shiga, toxin, producing, e, coli, stec, infection, this, toxin, further, causes, premature, destruction, of, the, red, blood, cells, which, then, clog, the, body, s, filtering, system, the, kidneys, in, some, rare, cases, usually, in, children, and, the, elderly, causing, hemolytic, uremic, syndrome, hus, which, may, lead, to, kidney, failure, and, even, death, signs, of, hemolytic, uremic, syndrome, include, decreased, frequency, of, urination, lethargy, and, paleness, of, cheeks, and, inside, the, lower, eyelids, in, 25, of, hus, patients, complications, of, nervous, system, occur, which, in, turn, causes, strokes, in, addition, this, strain, causes, the, buildup, of, fluid, since, the, kidneys, do, not, work, leading, to, edema, around, the, lungs, legs, and, arms, this, increase, in, fluid, buildup, especially, around, the, lungs, impedes, the, functioning, of, the, heart, causing, an, increase, in, blood, pressure, uropathogenic, e, coli, upec, is, one, of, the, main, causes, of, urinary, tract, infections, it, is, part, of, the, normal, microbiota, in, the, gut, and, can, be, introduced, in, many, ways, in, particular, for, females, the, direction, of, wiping, after, defecation, wiping, back, to, front, can, lead, to, fecal, contamination, of, the, urogenital, orifices, anal, intercourse, can, also, introduce, this, bacterium, into, the, male, urethra, and, in, switching, from, anal, to, vaginal, intercourse, the, male, can, also, introduce, upec, to, the, female, urogenital, system, enterotoxigenic, e, coli, etec, is, the, most, common, cause, of, traveler, s, diarrhea, with, as, many, as, 840, million, cases, worldwide, in, developing, countries, each, year, the, bacteria, typically, transmitted, through, contaminated, food, or, drinking, water, adheres, to, the, intestinal, lining, where, it, secretes, either, of, two, types, of, enterotoxins, leading, to, watery, diarrhea, the, rate, and, severity, of, infections, are, higher, among, children, under, the, age, of, five, including, as, many, as, 380, 000, deaths, annually, in, may, 2011, one, e, coli, strain, o104, h4, was, the, subject, of, a, bacterial, outbreak, that, began, in, germany, certain, strains, of, e, coli, are, a, major, cause, of, foodborne, illness, the, outbreak, started, when, several, people, in, germany, were, infected, with, enterohemorrhagic, e, coli, ehec, bacteria, leading, to, hemolytic, uremic, syndrome, hus, a, medical, emergency, that, requires, urgent, treatment, the, outbreak, did, not, only, concern, germany, but, also, 15, other, countries, including, regions, in, north, america, on, 30, june, 2011, the, german, bundesinstitut, f, r, risikobewertung, bfr, federal, institute, for, risk, assessment, a, federal, institute, within, the, german, federal, ministry, of, food, agriculture, and, consumer, protection, announced, that, seeds, of, fenugreek, from, egypt, were, likely, the, cause, of, the, ehec, outbreak, some, studies, have, demonstrated, an, absence, of, e, coli, in, the, gut, flora, of, subjects, with, the, metabolic, disorder, phenylketonuria, it, is, hypothesized, that, the, absence, of, these, normal, bacterium, impairs, the, production, of, the, key, vitamins, b, 2, riboflavin, and, k, 2, menaquinone, vitamins, which, are, implicated, in, many, physiological, roles, in, humans, such, as, cellular, and, bone, metabolism, and, so, contributes, to, the, disorder, carbapenem, resistant, e, coli, carbapenemase, producing, e, coli, that, are, resistant, to, the, carbapenem, class, of, antibiotics, considered, the, drugs, of, last, resort, for, such, infections, they, are, resistant, because, they, produce, an, enzyme, called, a, carbapenemase, that, disables, the, drug, molecule, the, time, between, ingesting, the, stec, bacteria, and, feeling, sick, is, called, the, incubation, period, the, incubation, period, is, usually, 3, 4, days, after, the, exposure, but, may, be, as, short, as, 1, day, or, as, long, as, 10, days, the, symptoms, often, begin, slowly, with, mild, belly, pain, or, non, bloody, diarrhea, that, worsens, over, several, days, hus, if, it, occurs, develops, an, average, 7, days, after, the, first, symptoms, when, the, diarrhea, is, improving, diagnosis, of, infectious, diarrhea, and, identification, of, antimicrobial, resistance, is, performed, using, a, stool, culture, with, subsequent, antibiotic, sensitivity, testing, it, requires, a, minimum, of, 2, days, and, maximum, of, several, weeks, to, culture, gastrointestinal, pathogens, the, sensitivity, true, positive, and, specificity, true, negative, rates, for, stool, culture, vary, by, pathogen, although, a, number, of, human, pathogens, can, not, be, cultured, for, culture, positive, samples, antimicrobial, resistance, testing, takes, an, additional, 12, 24, hours, to, perform, current, point, of, care, molecular, diagnostic, tests, can, identify, e, coli, and, antimicrobial, resistance, in, the, identified, strains, much, faster, than, culture, and, sensitivity, testing, microarray, based, platforms, can, identify, specific, pathogenic, strains, of, e, coli, and, e, coli, specific, amr, genes, in, two, hours, or, less, with, high, sensitivity, and, specificity, but, the, size, of, the, test, panel, i, e, total, pathogens, and, antimicrobial, resistance, genes, is, limited, newer, metagenomics, based, infectious, disease, diagnostic, platforms, are, currently, being, developed, to, overcome, the, various, limitations, of, culture, and, all, currently, available, molecular, diagnostic, technologies, the, mainstay, of, treatment, is, the, assessment, of, dehydration, and, replacement, of, fluid, and, electrolytes, administration, of, antibiotics, has, been, shown, to, shorten, the, course, of, illness, and, duration, of, excretion, of, enterotoxigenic, e, coli, etec, in, adults, in, endemic, areas, and, in, traveller, s, diarrhea, though, the, rate, of, resistance, to, commonly, used, antibiotics, is, increasing, and, they, are, generally, not, recommended, the, antibiotic, used, depends, upon, susceptibility, patterns, in, the, particular, geographical, region, currently, the, antibiotics, of, choice, are, fluoroquinolones, or, azithromycin, with, an, emerging, role, for, rifaximin, rifaximin, a, semisynthetic, rifamycin, derivative, is, an, effective, and, well, tolerated, antibacterial, for, the, management, of, adults, with, non, invasive, traveller, s, diarrhea, rifaximin, was, significantly, more, effective, than, placebo, and, no, less, effective, than, ciprofloxacin, in, reducing, the, duration, of, diarrhea, while, rifaximin, is, effective, in, patients, with, e, coli, predominant, traveller, s, diarrhea, it, appears, ineffective, in, patients, infected, with, inflammatory, or, invasive, enteropathogens, etec, is, the, type, of, e, coli, that, most, vaccine, development, efforts, are, focused, on, antibodies, against, the, lt, and, major, cfs, of, etec, provide, protection, against, lt, producing, etec, expressing, homologous, cfs, oral, inactivated, vaccines, consisting, of, toxin, antigen, and, whole, cells, i, e, the, licensed, recombinant, cholera, b, subunit, rctb, wc, cholera, vaccine, dukoral, have, been, developed, there, are, currently, no, licensed, vaccines, for, etec, though, several, are, in, various, stages, of, development, in, different, trials, the, rctb, wc, cholera, vaccine, provided, high, 85, 100, short, term, protection, an, oral, etec, vaccine, candidate, consisting, of, rctb, and, formalin, inactivated, e, coli, bacteria, expressing, major, cfs, has, been, shown, in, clinical, trials, to, be, safe, immunogenic, and, effective, against, severe, diarrhoea, in, american, travelers, but, not, against, etec, diarrhoea, in, young, children, in, egypt, a, modified, etec, vaccine, consisting, of, recombinant, e, coli, strains, over, expressing, the, major, cfs, and, a, more, lt, like, hybrid, toxoid, called, lctba, are, undergoing, clinical, testing, other, proven, prevention, methods, for, e, coli, transmission, include, handwashing, and, improved, sanitation, and, drinking, water, as, transmission, occurs, through, fecal, contamination, of, food, and, water, supplies, additionally, thoroughly, cooking, meat, and, avoiding, consumption, of, raw, unpasteurized, beverages, such, as, juices, and, milk, are, other, proven, methods, for, preventing, e, coli, lastly, cross, contamination, of, utensils, and, work, spaces, should, be, avoided, when, preparing, food, because, of, its, long, history, of, laboratory, culture, and, ease, of, manipulation, e, coli, plays, an, important, role, in, modern, biological, engineering, and, industrial, microbiology, the, work, of, stanley, norman, cohen, and, herbert, boyer, in, e, coli, using, plasmids, and, restriction, enzymes, to, create, recombinant, dna, became, a, foundation, of, biotechnology, e, coli, is, a, very, versatile, host, for, the, production, of, heterologous, proteins, and, various, protein, expression, systems, have, been, developed, which, allow, the, production, of, recombinant, proteins, in, e, coli, researchers, can, introduce, genes, into, the, microbes, using, plasmids, which, permit, high, level, expression, of, protein, and, such, protein, may, be, mass, produced, in, industrial, fermentation, processes, one, of, the, first, useful, applications, of, recombinant, dna, technology, was, the, manipulation, of, e, coli, to, produce, human, insulin, many, proteins, previously, thought, difficult, or, impossible, to, be, expressed, in, e, coli, in, folded, form, have, been, successfully, expressed, in, e, coli, for, example, proteins, with, multiple, disulphide, bonds, may, be, produced, in, the, periplasmic, space, or, in, the, cytoplasm, of, mutants, rendered, sufficiently, oxidizing, to, allow, disulphide, bonds, to, form, while, proteins, requiring, post, translational, modification, such, as, glycosylation, for, stability, or, function, have, been, expressed, using, the, n, linked, glycosylation, system, of, campylobacter, jejuni, engineered, into, e, coli, modified, e, coli, cells, have, been, used, in, vaccine, development, bioremediation, production, of, biofuels, lighting, and, production, of, immobilised, enzymes, strain, k, 12, is, a, mutant, form, of, e, coli, that, over, expresses, the, enzyme, alkaline, phosphatase, alp, the, mutation, arises, due, to, a, defect, in, the, gene, that, constantly, codes, for, the, enzyme, a, gene, that, is, producing, a, product, without, any, inhibition, is, said, to, have, constitutive, activity, this, particular, mutant, form, is, used, to, isolate, and, purify, the, aforementioned, enzyme, strain, op50, of, escherichia, coli, is, used, for, maintenance, of, caenorhabditis, elegans, cultures, strain, jm109, is, a, mutant, form, of, e, coli, that, is, reca, and, enda, deficient, the, strain, can, be, utilized, for, blue, white, screening, when, the, cells, carry, the, fertility, factor, episome, lack, of, reca, decreases, the, possibility, of, unwanted, restriction, of, the, dna, of, interest, and, lack, of, enda, inhibit, plasmid, dna, decomposition, thus, jm109, is, useful, for, cloning, and, expression, systems, e, coli, is, frequently, used, as, a, model, organism, in, microbiology, studies, cultivated, strains, e, g, e, coli, k12, are, well, adapted, to, the, laboratory, environment, and, unlike, wild, type, strains, have, lost, their, ability, to, thrive, in, the, intestine, many, laboratory, strains, lose, their, ability, to, form, biofilms, these, features, protect, wild, type, strains, from, antibodies, and, other, chemical, attacks, but, require, a, large, expenditure, of, energy, and, material, resources, e, coli, is, often, used, as, a, representative, microorganism, in, the, research, of, novel, water, treatment, and, sterilisation, methods, including, photocatalysis, by, standard, plate, count, methods, following, sequential, dilutions, and, growth, on, agar, gel, plates, the, concentration, of, viable, organisms, or, cfus, colony, forming, units, in, a, known, volume, of, treated, water, can, be, evaluated, allowing, the, comparative, assessment, of, materials, performance, in, 1946, joshua, lederberg, and, edward, tatum, first, described, the, phenomenon, known, as, bacterial, conjugation, using, e, coli, as, a, model, bacterium, and, it, remains, the, primary, model, to, study, conjugation, e, coli, was, an, integral, part, of, the, first, experiments, to, understand, phage, genetics, and, early, researchers, such, as, seymour, benzer, used, e, coli, and, phage, t4, to, understand, the, topography, of, gene, structure, prior, to, benzer, s, research, it, was, not, known, whether, the, gene, was, a, linear, structure, or, if, it, had, a, branching, pattern, e, coli, was, one, of, the, first, organisms, to, have, its, genome, sequenced, the, complete, genome, of, e, coli, k12, was, published, by, science, in, 1997, from, 2002, to, 2010, a, team, at, the, hungarian, academy, of, science, created, a, strain, of, escherichia, coli, called, mds42, which, is, now, sold, by, scarab, genomics, of, madison, wi, under, the, name, of, clean, genome, e, coli, where, 15, of, the, genome, of, the, parental, strain, e, coli, k, 12, mg1655, were, removed, to, aid, in, molecular, biology, efficiency, removing, is, elements, pseudogenes, and, phages, resulting, in, better, maintenance, of, plasmid, encoded, toxic, genes, which, are, often, inactivated, by, transposons, biochemistry, and, replication, machinery, were, not, altered, by, evaluating, the, possible, combination, of, nanotechnologies, with, landscape, ecology, complex, habitat, landscapes, can, be, generated, with, details, at, the, nanoscale, on, such, synthetic, ecosystems, evolutionary, experiments, with, e, coli, have, been, performed, to, study, the, spatial, biophysics, of, adaptation, in, an, island, biogeography, on, chip, in, other, studies, non, pathogenic, e, coli, has, been, used, as, a, model, microorganism, towards, understanding, the, effects, of, simulated, microgravity, on, earth, on, the, same, since, 1961, scientists, proposed, the, idea, of, genetic, circuits, used, for, computational, tasks, collaboration, between, biologists, and, computing, scientists, has, allowed, designing, digital, logic, gates, on, the, metabolism, of, e, coli, as, lac, operon, is, a, two, stage, process, genetic, regulation, in, the, bacteria, is, used, to, realize, computing, functions, the, process, is, controlled, at, the, transcription, stage, of, dna, into, messenger, rna, studies, are, being, performed, attempting, to, program, e, coli, to, solve, complicated, mathematics, problems, such, as, the, hamiltonian, path, problem, a, computer, to, control, protein, production, of, e, coli, within, yeast, cells, has, been, developed, a, method, has, also, been, developed, to, use, bacteria, to, behave, as, an, lcd, screen, in, july, 2017, separate, experiments, with, e, coli, published, on, nature, showed, the, potential, of, using, living, cells, for, computing, tasks, and, storing, information, a, team, formed, with, collaborators, of, the, biodesign, institute, at, arizona, state, university, and, harvard, s, wyss, institute, for, biologically, inspired, engineering, developed, a, biological, computer, inside, e, coli, that, responded, to, a, dozen, inputs, the, team, called, the, computer, ribocomputer, as, it, was, composed, of, ribonucleic, acid, meanwhile, harvard, researchers, probed, that, is, possible, to, store, information, in, bacteria, after, successfully, archiving, images, and, movies, in, the, dna, of, living, e, coli, cells, in, 2021, a, team, led, by, biophysicist, sangram, bagh, realized, a, study, with, e, coli, to, solve, 2, 2, maze, problems, to, probe, the, principle, for, distributed, computing, among, cells, in, 1885, the, german, austrian, pediatrician, theodor, escherich, discovered, this, organism, in, the, feces, of, healthy, individuals, he, called, it, bacterium, coli, commune, because, it, is, found, in, the, colon, early, classifications, of, prokaryotes, placed, these, in, a, handful, of, genera, based, on, their, shape, and, motility, at, that, time, ernst, haeckel, s, classification, of, bacteria, in, the, kingdom, monera, was, in, place, bacterium, coli, was, the, type, species, of, the, now, invalid, genus, bacterium, when, it, was, revealed, that, the, former, type, species, bacterium, triloculare, was, missing, following, a, revision, of, bacterium, it, was, reclassified, as, bacillus, coli, by, migula, in, 1895, and, later, reclassified, in, the, newly, created, genus, escherichia, named, after, its, original, discoverer, by, aldo, castellani, and, albert, john, chalmers, in, 1996, an, outbreak, of, e, coli, food, poisoning, occurred, in, wishaw, scotland, killing, 21, people, this, death, toll, was, exceeded, in, 2011, when, the, 2011, germany, e, coli, o104, h4, outbreak, linked, to, organic, fenugreek, sprouts, killed, 53, people, e, coli, has, several, practical, uses, besides, its, use, as, a, vector, for, genetic, experiments, and, processes, for, example, e, coli, can, be, used, to, generate, synthetic, propane, and, recombinant, human, growth,
