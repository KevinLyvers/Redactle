staphylococcus, aureus, is, a, gram, positive, spherically, shaped, bacterium, a, member, of, the, bacillota, and, is, a, usual, member, of, the, microbiota, of, the, body, frequently, found, in, the, upper, respiratory, tract, and, on, the, skin, it, is, often, positive, for, catalase, and, nitrate, reduction, and, is, a, facultative, anaerobe, meaning, that, it, can, grow, without, oxygen, although, s, aureus, usually, acts, as, a, commensal, of, the, human, microbiota, it, can, also, become, an, opportunistic, pathogen, being, a, common, cause, of, skin, infections, including, abscesses, respiratory, infections, such, as, sinusitis, and, food, poisoning, pathogenic, strains, often, promote, infections, by, producing, virulence, factors, such, as, potent, protein, toxins, and, the, expression, of, a, cell, surface, protein, that, binds, and, inactivates, antibodies, s, aureus, is, one, of, the, leading, pathogens, for, deaths, associated, with, antimicrobial, resistance, and, the, emergence, of, antibiotic, resistant, strains, such, as, methicillin, resistant, s, aureus, mrsa, the, bacterium, is, a, worldwide, problem, in, clinical, medicine, despite, much, research, and, development, no, vaccine, for, s, aureus, has, been, approved, an, estimated, 21, to, 30, of, the, human, population, are, long, term, carriers, of, s, aureus, which, can, be, found, as, part, of, the, normal, skin, microbiota, in, the, nostrils, and, as, a, normal, inhabitant, of, the, lower, reproductive, tract, of, females, s, aureus, can, cause, a, range, of, illnesses, from, minor, skin, infections, such, as, pimples, impetigo, boils, cellulitis, folliculitis, carbuncles, scalded, skin, syndrome, and, abscesses, to, life, threatening, diseases, such, as, pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, toxic, shock, syndrome, bacteremia, and, sepsis, it, is, still, one, of, the, five, most, common, causes, of, hospital, acquired, infections, and, is, often, the, cause, of, wound, infections, following, surgery, each, year, around, 500, 000, hospital, patients, in, the, united, states, contract, a, staphylococcal, infection, chiefly, by, s, aureus, up, to, 50, 000, deaths, each, year, in, the, u, s, are, linked, to, staphylococcal, infection, in, 1880, alexander, ogston, a, scottish, surgeon, discovered, that, staphylococcus, can, cause, wound, infections, after, noticing, groups, of, bacteria, in, pus, from, a, surgical, abscess, during, a, procedure, he, was, performing, he, named, it, staphylococcus, after, its, clustered, appearance, evident, under, a, microscope, then, in, 1884, german, scientist, friedrich, julius, rosenbach, identified, staphylococcus, aureus, discriminating, and, separating, it, from, staphylococcus, albus, a, related, bacterium, in, the, early, 1930s, doctors, began, to, use, a, more, streamlined, test, to, detect, the, presence, of, an, s, aureus, infection, by, the, means, of, coagulase, testing, which, enables, detection, of, an, enzyme, produced, by, the, bacterium, prior, to, the, 1940s, s, aureus, infections, were, fatal, in, the, majority, of, patients, however, doctors, discovered, that, the, use, of, penicillin, could, cure, s, aureus, infections, unfortunately, by, the, end, of, the, 1940s, penicillin, resistance, became, widespread, amongst, this, bacterium, population, and, outbreaks, of, the, resistant, strain, began, to, occur, staphylococcus, aureus, can, be, sorted, into, ten, dominant, human, lineages, there, are, numerous, minor, lineages, as, well, but, these, are, not, seen, in, the, population, as, often, genomes, of, bacteria, within, the, same, lineage, are, mostly, conserved, with, the, exception, of, mobile, genetic, elements, mobile, genetic, elements, that, are, common, in, s, aureus, include, bacteriophages, pathogenicity, islands, plasmids, transposons, and, staphylococcal, cassette, chromosomes, these, elements, have, enabled, s, aureus, to, continually, evolve, and, gain, new, traits, there, is, a, great, deal, of, genetic, variation, within, the, s, aureus, species, a, study, by, fitzgerald, et, al, 2001, revealed, that, approximately, 22, of, the, s, aureus, genome, is, non, coding, and, thus, can, differ, from, bacterium, to, bacterium, an, example, of, this, difference, is, seen, in, the, species, virulence, only, a, few, strains, of, s, aureus, are, associated, with, infections, in, humans, this, demonstrates, that, there, is, a, large, range, of, infectious, ability, within, the, species, it, has, been, proposed, that, one, possible, reason, for, the, great, deal, of, heterogeneity, within, the, species, could, be, due, to, its, reliance, on, heterogeneous, infections, this, occurs, when, multiple, different, types, of, s, aureus, cause, an, infection, within, a, host, the, different, strains, can, secrete, different, enzymes, or, bring, different, antibiotic, resistances, to, the, group, increasing, its, pathogenic, ability, thus, there, is, a, need, for, a, large, number, of, mutations, and, acquisitions, of, mobile, genetic, elements, another, notable, evolutionary, process, within, the, s, aureus, species, is, its, co, evolution, with, its, human, hosts, over, time, this, parasitic, relationship, has, led, to, the, bacterium, s, ability, to, be, carried, in, the, nasopharynx, of, humans, without, causing, symptoms, or, infection, this, allows, it, to, be, passed, throughout, the, human, population, increasing, its, fitness, as, a, species, however, only, approximately, 50, of, the, human, population, are, carriers, of, s, aureus, with, 20, as, continuous, carriers, and, 30, as, intermittent, this, leads, scientists, to, believe, that, there, are, many, factors, that, determine, whether, s, aureus, is, carried, asymptomatically, in, humans, including, factors, that, are, specific, to, an, individual, person, according, to, a, 1995, study, by, hofman, et, al, these, factors, may, include, age, sex, diabetes, and, smoking, they, also, determined, some, genetic, variations, in, humans, that, lead, to, an, increased, ability, for, s, aureus, to, colonize, notably, a, polymorphism, in, the, glucocorticoid, receptor, gene, that, results, in, larger, corticosteroid, production, in, conclusion, there, is, evidence, that, any, strain, of, this, bacterium, can, become, invasive, as, this, is, highly, dependent, upon, human, factors, though, s, aureus, has, quick, reproductive, and, micro, evolutionary, rates, there, are, multiple, barriers, that, prevent, evolution, with, the, species, one, such, barrier, is, agr, which, is, a, global, accessory, gene, regulator, within, the, bacteria, this, such, regulator, has, been, linked, to, the, virulence, level, of, the, bacteria, loss, of, function, mutations, within, this, gene, have, been, found, to, increase, the, fitness, of, the, bacterium, containing, it, thus, s, aureus, must, make, a, trade, off, to, increase, their, success, as, a, species, exchanging, reduced, virulence, for, increased, drug, resistance, another, barrier, to, evolution, is, the, sau1, type, i, restriction, modification, rm, system, this, system, exists, to, protect, the, bacterium, from, foreign, dna, by, digesting, it, exchange, of, dna, between, the, same, lineage, is, not, blocked, since, they, have, the, same, enzymes, and, the, rm, system, does, not, recognize, the, new, dna, as, foreign, but, transfer, between, different, lineages, is, blocked, staphylococcus, aureus, s, t, f, l, k, k, s, r, i, s, l, o, greek, grape, cluster, berry, latin, aureus, golden, is, a, facultative, anaerobic, gram, positive, coccal, round, bacterium, also, known, as, golden, staph, and, oro, staphira, s, aureus, is, nonmotile, and, does, not, form, spores, in, medical, literature, the, bacterium, is, often, referred, to, as, s, aureus, staph, aureus, or, staph, a, s, aureus, appears, as, staphylococci, grape, like, clusters, when, viewed, through, a, microscope, and, has, large, round, golden, yellow, colonies, often, with, hemolysis, when, grown, on, blood, agar, plates, s, aureus, reproduces, asexually, by, binary, fission, complete, separation, of, the, daughter, cells, is, mediated, by, s, aureus, autolysin, and, in, its, absence, or, targeted, inhibition, the, daughter, cells, remain, attached, to, one, another, and, appear, as, clusters, staphylococcus, aureus, is, catalase, positive, meaning, it, can, produce, the, enzyme, catalase, catalase, converts, hydrogen, peroxide, h, 2, o, 2, to, water, and, oxygen, catalase, activity, tests, are, sometimes, used, to, distinguish, staphylococci, from, enterococci, and, streptococci, previously, s, aureus, was, differentiated, from, other, staphylococci, by, the, coagulase, test, however, not, all, s, aureus, strains, are, coagulase, positive, and, incorrect, species, identification, can, impact, effective, treatment, and, control, measures, natural, genetic, transformation, is, a, reproductive, process, involving, dna, transfer, from, one, bacterium, to, another, through, the, intervening, medium, and, the, integration, of, the, donor, sequence, into, the, recipient, genome, by, homologous, recombination, s, aureus, was, found, to, be, capable, of, natural, genetic, transformation, but, only, at, low, frequency, under, the, experimental, conditions, employed, further, studies, suggested, that, the, development, of, competence, for, natural, genetic, transformation, may, be, substantially, higher, under, appropriate, conditions, yet, to, be, discovered, in, humans, s, aureus, can, be, present, in, the, upper, respiratory, tract, gut, mucosa, and, skin, as, a, member, of, the, normal, microbiota, however, because, s, aureus, can, cause, disease, under, certain, host, and, environmental, conditions, it, is, characterized, as, a, pathobiont, while, s, aureus, usually, acts, as, a, commensal, bacterium, asymptomatically, colonizing, about, 30, of, the, human, population, it, can, sometimes, cause, disease, in, particular, s, aureus, is, one, of, the, most, common, causes, of, bacteremia, and, infective, endocarditis, additionally, it, can, cause, various, skin, and, soft, tissue, infections, particularly, when, skin, or, mucosal, barriers, have, been, breached, staphylococcus, aureus, infections, can, spread, through, contact, with, pus, from, an, infected, wound, skin, to, skin, contact, with, an, infected, person, and, contact, with, objects, used, by, an, infected, person, such, as, towels, sheets, clothing, or, athletic, equipment, joint, replacements, put, a, person, at, particular, risk, of, septic, arthritis, staphylococcal, endocarditis, infection, of, the, heart, valves, and, pneumonia, staphylococcus, aureus, is, a, significant, cause, of, chronic, biofilm, infections, on, medical, implants, and, the, repressor, of, toxins, is, part, of, the, infection, pathway, staphylococcus, aureus, can, lie, dormant, in, the, body, for, years, undetected, once, symptoms, begin, to, show, the, host, is, contagious, for, another, two, weeks, and, the, overall, illness, lasts, a, few, weeks, if, untreated, though, the, disease, can, be, deadly, deeply, penetrating, s, aureus, infections, can, be, severe, skin, infections, are, the, most, common, form, of, s, aureus, infection, this, can, manifest, in, various, ways, including, small, benign, boils, folliculitis, impetigo, cellulitis, and, more, severe, invasive, soft, tissue, infections, staphylococcus, aureus, is, extremely, prevalent, in, persons, with, atopic, dermatitis, ad, more, commonly, known, as, eczema, it, is, mostly, found, in, fertile, active, places, including, the, armpits, hair, and, scalp, large, pimples, that, appear, in, those, areas, may, exacerbate, the, infection, if, lacerated, colonization, of, s, aureus, drives, inflammation, of, ad, s, aureus, is, believed, to, exploit, defects, in, the, skin, barrier, of, persons, with, atopic, dermatitis, triggering, cytokine, expression, and, therefore, exacerbating, symptoms, this, can, lead, to, staphylococcal, scalded, skin, syndrome, a, severe, form, of, which, can, be, seen, in, newborns, antibiotics, are, commonly, used, to, target, overgrowth, of, s, aureus, but, their, benefit, is, limited, and, they, increase, the, risk, of, antimicrobial, resistance, for, these, reasons, they, are, only, recommended, for, people, who, not, only, present, symptoms, on, the, skin, but, feel, systematically, unwell, staphylococcus, aureus, is, also, responsible, for, food, poisoning, and, achieves, this, by, generating, toxins, in, the, food, which, is, then, ingested, its, incubation, period, lasts, 30, minutes, to, eight, hours, with, the, illness, itself, lasting, from, 30, minutes, to, 3, days, preventive, measures, one, can, take, to, help, prevent, the, spread, of, the, disease, include, washing, hands, thoroughly, with, soap, and, water, before, preparing, food, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, recommends, staying, away, from, any, food, if, ill, and, wearing, gloves, if, any, open, wounds, occur, on, hands, or, wrists, while, preparing, food, if, storing, food, for, longer, than, 2, hours, it, is, recommended, to, keep, the, food, below, 4, 4, or, above, 60, c, below, 40, or, above, 140, f, staphylococcus, aureus, is, a, common, cause, of, major, bone, and, joint, infections, including, osteomyelitis, septic, arthritis, and, infections, following, joint, replacement, surgeries, staphylococcus, aureus, is, a, leading, cause, of, bloodstream, infections, throughout, much, of, the, industrialized, world, infection, is, generally, associated, with, breaks, in, the, skin, or, mucosal, membranes, due, to, surgery, injury, or, use, of, intravascular, devices, such, as, cannulas, hemodialysis, machines, or, hypodermic, needles, once, the, bacteria, have, entered, the, bloodstream, they, can, infect, various, organs, causing, infective, endocarditis, septic, arthritis, and, osteomyelitis, this, disease, is, particularly, prevalent, and, severe, in, the, very, young, and, very, old, without, antibiotic, treatment, s, aureus, bacteremia, has, a, case, fatality, rate, around, 80, with, antibiotic, treatment, case, fatality, rates, range, from, 15, to, 50, depending, on, the, age, and, health, of, the, patient, as, well, as, the, antibiotic, resistance, of, the, s, aureus, strain, staphylococcus, aureus, is, often, found, in, biofilms, formed, on, medical, devices, implanted, in, the, body, or, on, human, tissue, it, is, commonly, found, with, another, pathogen, candida, albicans, forming, multispecies, biofilms, the, latter, is, suspected, to, help, s, aureus, penetrate, human, tissue, a, higher, mortality, is, linked, with, multispecies, biofilms, staphylococcus, aureus, biofilm, is, the, predominant, cause, of, orthopedic, implant, related, infections, but, is, also, found, on, cardiac, implants, vascular, grafts, various, catheters, and, cosmetic, surgical, implants, after, implantation, the, surface, of, these, devices, becomes, coated, with, host, proteins, which, provide, a, rich, surface, for, bacterial, attachment, and, biofilm, formation, once, the, device, becomes, infected, it, must, be, completely, removed, since, s, aureus, biofilm, cannot, be, destroyed, by, antibiotic, treatments, current, therapy, for, s, aureus, biofilm, mediated, infections, involves, surgical, removal, of, the, infected, device, followed, by, antibiotic, treatment, conventional, antibiotic, treatment, alone, is, not, effective, in, eradicating, such, infections, an, alternative, to, postsurgical, antibiotic, treatment, is, using, antibiotic, loaded, dissolvable, calcium, sulfate, beads, which, are, implanted, with, the, medical, device, these, beads, can, release, high, doses, of, antibiotics, at, the, desired, site, to, prevent, the, initial, infection, novel, treatments, for, s, aureus, biofilm, involving, nano, silver, particles, bacteriophages, and, plant, derived, antibiotic, agents, are, being, studied, these, agents, have, shown, inhibitory, effects, against, s, aureus, embedded, in, biofilms, a, class, of, enzymes, have, been, found, to, have, biofilm, matrix, degrading, ability, thus, may, be, used, as, biofilm, dispersal, agents, in, combination, with, antibiotics, staphylococcus, aureus, can, survive, on, dogs, cats, and, horses, and, can, cause, bumblefoot, in, chickens, some, believe, health, care, workers, dogs, should, be, considered, a, significant, source, of, antibiotic, resistant, s, aureus, especially, in, times, of, outbreak, in, a, 2008, study, by, boost, o, donoghue, and, james, it, was, found, that, just, about, 90, of, s, aureus, colonized, within, pet, dogs, presented, as, resistant, to, at, least, one, antibiotic, the, nasal, region, has, been, implicated, as, the, most, important, site, of, transfer, between, dogs, and, humans, staphylococcus, aureus, is, one, of, the, causal, agents, of, mastitis, in, dairy, cows, its, large, polysaccharide, capsule, protects, the, organism, from, recognition, by, the, cow, s, immune, defenses, staphylococcus, aureus, produces, various, enzymes, such, as, coagulase, bound, and, free, coagulases, which, facilitates, the, conversion, of, fibrinogen, to, fibrin, to, cause, clots, which, is, important, in, skin, infections, hyaluronidase, also, known, as, spreading, factor, breaks, down, hyaluronic, acid, and, helps, in, spreading, it, deoxyribonuclease, which, breaks, down, the, dna, protects, s, aureus, from, neutrophil, extracellular, trap, mediated, killing, s, aureus, also, produces, lipase, to, digest, lipids, staphylokinase, to, dissolve, fibrin, and, aid, in, spread, and, beta, lactamase, for, drug, resistance, depending, on, the, strain, s, aureus, is, capable, of, secreting, several, exotoxins, which, can, be, categorized, into, three, groups, many, of, these, toxins, are, associated, with, specific, diseases, a, secretion, system, is, a, highly, specialised, multi, protein, unit, that, is, embedded, in, the, cell, envelope, with, the, function, of, translocating, effector, proteins, from, inside, of, the, cell, to, the, extracellular, space, or, into, a, target, host, cytosol, the, exact, structure, and, function, of, t7ss, is, yet, to, be, fully, elucidated, currently, four, proteins, are, known, components, of, s, aureus, type, vii, secretion, system, essc, is, a, large, integral, membrane, atpase, which, most, likely, powers, the, secretion, systems, and, has, been, hypothesised, forming, part, of, the, translocation, channel, the, other, proteins, are, esaa, essb, essa, that, are, membrane, proteins, that, function, alongside, essc, to, mediate, protein, secretion, the, exact, mechanism, of, how, substrates, reach, the, cell, surface, is, unknown, as, is, the, interaction, of, the, three, membrane, proteins, with, each, other, and, essc, t7, dependent, effector, proteins, esad, is, dna, endonuclease, toxin, secreted, by, s, aureus, has, been, shown, to, inhibit, growth, of, competitor, s, aureus, strain, in, vitro, esad, is, cosecreted, with, chaperone, esae, which, stabilises, esad, structure, and, brings, esad, to, essc, for, secretion, strains, that, produce, esad, also, co, produce, esag, a, cytoplasmic, anti, toxin, that, protects, the, producer, strain, from, esad, s, toxicity, tspa, is, another, toxin, that, mediates, intraspecies, competition, it, is, a, bacteriostatic, toxin, that, has, a, membrane, depolarising, activity, facilitated, by, its, c, terminal, domain, tsai, is, a, transmembrane, protein, that, confers, immunity, to, the, producer, strain, of, tspa, as, well, as, the, attacked, strains, there, is, genetic, variability, of, the, c, terminal, domain, of, tspa, therefore, it, seems, like, the, strains, may, produce, different, tspa, variants, to, increase, competitiveness, toxins, that, play, a, role, in, intraspecies, competition, confers, an, advantage, by, promoting, successful, colonisation, in, polymicrobial, communities, such, as, the, nasopharynx, and, lung, by, outcompeting, lesser, strains, there, are, also, t7, effector, proteins, that, play, role, a, in, pathogenesis, for, example, mutational, studies, of, s, aureus, have, suggested, that, esxb, and, esxc, contribute, to, persistent, infection, in, a, murine, abscess, model, esxx, has, been, implicated, in, neutrophil, lysis, therefore, suggested, as, contributing, to, the, evasion, of, host, immune, system, deletion, of, essx, in, s, aureus, resulted, in, significantly, reduced, resistance, to, neutrophils, and, reduced, virulence, in, murine, skin, and, blood, infection, models, altogether, t7ss, and, known, secreted, effector, proteins, are, a, strategy, of, pathogenesis, by, improving, fitness, against, competitor, s, aureus, species, as, well, as, increased, virulence, via, evading, the, innate, immune, system, and, optimising, persistent, infections, the, list, of, small, rnas, involved, in, the, control, of, bacterial, virulence, in, s, aureus, is, growing, this, can, be, facilitated, by, factors, such, as, increased, biofilm, formation, in, the, presence, of, increased, levels, of, such, small, rnas, for, example, rnaiii, sprd, sprc, rsae, spra1, ssr42, artr, sprx, and, teg49, host, neutrophils, cause, dna, double, strand, breaks, in, s, aureus, through, the, production, of, reactive, oxygen, species, for, infection, of, a, host, to, be, successful, s, aureus, must, survive, such, damages, caused, by, the, hosts, defenses, the, two, protein, complex, rexab, encoded, by, s, aureus, is, employed, in, the, recombinational, repair, of, dna, double, strand, breaks, many, mrnas, in, s, aureus, carry, three, prime, untranslated, regions, 3, utr, longer, than, 100, nucleotides, which, may, potentially, have, a, regulatory, function, further, investigation, of, i, car, mrna, mrna, coding, for, the, repressor, of, the, main, expolysaccharidic, compound, of, the, bacteria, biofilm, matrix, demonstrated, that, the, 3, utr, binding, to, the, 5, utr, can, interfere, with, the, translation, initiation, complex, and, generate, a, double, stranded, substrate, for, rnase, iii, the, interaction, is, between, the, uccccug, motif, in, the, 3, utr, and, the, shine, dalagarno, region, at, the, 5, utr, deletion, of, the, motif, resulted, in, icar, repressor, accumulation, and, inhibition, of, biofilm, development, the, biofilm, formation, is, the, main, cause, of, staphylococcus, implant, infections, biofilms, are, groups, of, microorganisms, such, as, bacteria, that, attach, to, each, other, and, grow, on, wet, surfaces, the, s, aureus, biofilm, is, embedded, in, a, glycocalyx, slime, layer, and, can, consist, of, teichoic, acids, host, proteins, extracellular, dna, edna, and, sometimes, polysaccharide, intercellular, antigen, pia, s, aureus, biofilms, are, important, in, disease, pathogenesis, as, they, can, contribute, to, antibiotic, resistance, and, immune, system, evasion, s, aureus, biofilm, has, high, resistance, to, antibiotic, treatments, and, host, immune, response, one, hypothesis, for, explaining, this, is, that, the, biofilm, matrix, protects, the, embedded, cells, by, acting, as, a, barrier, to, prevent, antibiotic, penetration, however, the, biofilm, matrix, is, composed, with, many, water, channels, so, this, hypothesis, is, becoming, increasingly, less, likely, but, a, biofilm, matrix, possibly, contains, antibiotic, degrading, enzymes, such, as, lactamases, which, can, prevent, antibiotic, penetration, another, hypothesis, is, that, the, conditions, in, the, biofilm, matrix, favor, the, formation, of, persister, cells, which, are, highly, antibiotic, resistant, dormant, bacterial, cells, s, aureus, biofilms, also, have, high, resistance, to, host, immune, response, though, the, exact, mechanism, of, resistance, is, unknown, s, aureus, biofilms, have, increased, growth, under, the, presence, of, cytokines, produced, by, the, host, immune, response, host, antibodies, are, less, effective, for, s, aureus, biofilm, due, to, the, heterogeneous, antigen, distribution, where, an, antigen, may, be, present, in, some, areas, of, the, biofilm, but, completely, absent, from, other, areas, studies, in, biofilm, development, have, shown, to, be, related, to, changes, in, gene, expression, there, are, specific, genes, that, were, found, to, be, crucial, in, the, different, biofilm, growth, stages, two, of, these, genes, include, rocd, and, gudb, which, encode, for, the, enzyme, s, ornithine, oxo, acid, transaminase, and, glutamate, dehydrogenase, which, are, important, for, amino, acid, metabolism, studies, have, shown, biofilm, development, rely, on, amino, acids, glutamine, and, glutamate, for, proper, metabolic, functions, protein, a, is, anchored, to, staphylococcal, peptidoglycan, pentaglycine, bridges, chains, of, five, glycine, residues, by, the, transpeptidase, sortase, a, protein, a, an, igg, binding, protein, binds, to, the, fc, region, of, an, antibody, in, fact, studies, involving, mutation, of, genes, coding, for, protein, a, resulted, in, a, lowered, virulence, of, s, aureus, as, measured, by, survival, in, blood, which, has, led, to, speculation, that, protein, a, contributed, virulence, requires, binding, of, antibody, fc, regions, protein, a, in, various, recombinant, forms, has, been, used, for, decades, to, bind, and, purify, a, wide, range, of, antibodies, by, immunoaffinity, chromatography, transpeptidases, such, as, the, sortases, responsible, for, anchoring, factors, like, protein, a, to, the, staphylococcal, peptidoglycan, are, being, studied, in, hopes, of, developing, new, antibiotics, to, target, mrsa, infections, some, strains, of, s, aureus, are, capable, of, producing, staphyloxanthin, a, golden, coloured, carotenoid, pigment, this, pigment, acts, as, a, virulence, factor, primarily, by, being, a, bacterial, antioxidant, which, helps, the, microbe, evade, the, reactive, oxygen, species, which, the, host, immune, system, uses, to, kill, pathogens, mutant, strains, of, s, aureus, modified, to, lack, staphyloxanthin, are, less, likely, to, survive, incubation, with, an, oxidizing, chemical, such, as, hydrogen, peroxide, than, pigmented, strains, mutant, colonies, are, quickly, killed, when, exposed, to, human, neutrophils, while, many, of, the, pigmented, colonies, survive, in, mice, the, pigmented, strains, cause, lingering, abscesses, when, inoculated, into, wounds, whereas, wounds, infected, with, the, unpigmented, strains, quickly, heal, these, tests, suggest, the, staphylococcus, strains, use, staphyloxanthin, as, a, defence, against, the, normal, human, immune, system, drugs, designed, to, inhibit, the, production, of, staphyloxanthin, may, weaken, the, bacterium, and, renew, its, susceptibility, to, antibiotics, in, fact, because, of, similarities, in, the, pathways, for, biosynthesis, of, staphyloxanthin, and, human, cholesterol, a, drug, developed, in, the, context, of, cholesterol, lowering, therapy, was, shown, to, block, s, aureus, pigmentation, and, disease, progression, in, a, mouse, infection, model, depending, upon, the, type, of, infection, present, an, appropriate, specimen, is, obtained, accordingly, and, sent, to, the, laboratory, for, definitive, identification, by, using, biochemical, or, enzyme, based, tests, a, gram, stain, is, first, performed, to, guide, the, way, which, should, show, typical, gram, positive, bacteria, cocci, in, clusters, second, the, isolate, is, cultured, on, mannitol, salt, agar, which, is, a, selective, medium, with, 7, 5, nacl, that, allows, s, aureus, to, grow, producing, yellow, colored, colonies, as, a, result, of, mannitol, fermentation, and, subsequent, drop, in, the, medium, s, ph, furthermore, for, differentiation, on, the, species, level, catalase, positive, for, all, staphylococcus, species, coagulase, fibrin, clot, formation, positive, for, s, aureus, dnase, zone, of, clearance, on, dnase, agar, lipase, a, yellow, color, and, rancid, odor, smell, and, phosphatase, a, pink, color, tests, are, all, done, for, staphylococcal, food, poisoning, phage, typing, can, be, performed, to, determine, whether, the, staphylococci, recovered, from, the, food, were, the, source, of, infection, diagnostic, microbiology, laboratories, and, reference, laboratories, are, key, for, identifying, outbreaks, and, new, strains, of, s, aureus, recent, genetic, advances, have, enabled, reliable, and, rapid, techniques, for, the, identification, and, characterization, of, clinical, isolates, of, s, aureus, in, real, time, these, tools, support, infection, control, strategies, to, limit, bacterial, spread, and, ensure, the, appropriate, use, of, antibiotics, quantitative, pcr, is, increasingly, being, used, to, identify, outbreaks, of, infection, when, observing, the, evolvement, of, s, aureus, and, its, ability, to, adapt, to, each, modified, antibiotic, two, basic, methods, known, as, band, based, or, sequence, based, are, employed, keeping, these, two, methods, in, mind, other, methods, such, as, multilocus, sequence, typing, mlst, pulsed, field, gel, electrophoresis, pfge, bacteriophage, typing, spa, locus, typing, and, sccmec, typing, are, often, conducted, more, than, others, with, these, methods, it, can, be, determined, where, strains, of, mrsa, originated, and, also, where, they, are, currently, with, mlst, this, technique, of, typing, uses, fragments, of, several, housekeeping, genes, known, as, aroe, glpf, gmk, pta, tip, and, yqil, these, sequences, are, then, assigned, a, number, which, give, to, a, string, of, several, numbers, that, serve, as, the, allelic, profile, although, this, is, a, common, method, a, limitation, about, this, method, is, the, maintenance, of, the, microarray, which, detects, newly, allelic, profiles, making, it, a, costly, and, time, consuming, experiment, with, pfge, a, method, which, is, still, very, much, used, dating, back, to, its, first, success, in, 1980s, remains, capable, of, helping, differentiate, mrsa, isolates, to, accomplish, this, the, technique, uses, multiple, gel, electrophoresis, along, with, a, voltage, gradient, to, display, clear, resolutions, of, molecules, the, s, aureus, fragments, then, transition, down, the, gel, producing, specific, band, patterns, that, are, later, compared, with, other, isolates, in, hopes, of, identifying, related, strains, limitations, of, the, method, include, practical, difficulties, with, uniform, band, patterns, and, pfge, sensitivity, as, a, whole, spa, locus, typing, is, also, considered, a, popular, technique, that, uses, a, single, locus, zone, in, a, polymorphic, region, of, s, aureus, to, distinguish, any, form, of, mutations, although, this, technique, is, often, inexpensive, and, less, time, consuming, the, chance, of, losing, discriminatory, power, making, it, hard, to, differentiate, between, mlst, clonal, complexes, exemplifies, a, crucial, limitation, for, susceptible, strains, the, treatment, of, choice, for, s, aureus, infection, is, penicillin, an, antibiotic, derived, from, some, penicillium, fungal, species, penicillin, inhibits, the, formation, of, peptidoglycan, cross, linkages, that, provide, the, rigidity, and, strength, in, a, bacterial, cell, wall, the, four, membered, lactam, ring, of, penicillin, is, bound, to, enzyme, dd, transpeptidase, an, enzyme, that, when, functional, cross, links, chains, of, peptidoglycan, that, form, bacterial, cell, walls, the, binding, of, lactam, to, dd, transpeptidase, inhibits, the, enzyme, s, functionality, and, it, can, no, longer, catalyze, the, formation, of, the, cross, links, as, a, result, cell, wall, formation, and, degradation, are, imbalanced, thus, resulting, in, cell, death, in, most, countries, however, penicillin, resistance, is, extremely, common, 90, and, first, line, therapy, is, most, commonly, a, penicillinase, resistant, lactam, antibiotic, for, example, oxacillin, or, flucloxacillin, both, of, which, have, the, same, mechanism, of, action, as, penicillin, or, vancomycin, depending, on, local, resistance, patterns, combination, therapy, with, gentamicin, may, be, used, to, treat, serious, infections, such, as, endocarditis, but, its, use, is, controversial, because, of, the, high, risk, of, damage, to, the, kidneys, the, duration, of, treatment, depends, on, the, site, of, infection, and, on, severity, adjunctive, rifampicin, has, been, historically, used, in, the, management, of, s, aureus, bacteraemia, but, randomised, controlled, trial, evidence, has, shown, this, to, be, of, no, overall, benefit, over, standard, antibiotic, therapy, antibiotic, resistance, in, s, aureus, was, uncommon, when, penicillin, was, first, introduced, in, 1943, indeed, the, original, petri, dish, on, which, alexander, fleming, of, imperial, college, london, observed, the, antibacterial, activity, of, the, penicillium, fungus, was, growing, a, culture, of, s, aureus, by, 1950, 40, of, hospital, s, aureus, isolates, were, penicillin, resistant, by, 1960, this, had, risen, to, 80, methicillin, resistant, staphylococcus, aureus, mrsa, often, pronounced, m, r, s, or, m, r, s, e, is, one, of, a, number, of, greatly, feared, strains, of, s, aureus, which, have, become, resistant, to, most, lactam, antibiotics, for, this, reason, vancomycin, a, glycopeptide, antibiotic, is, commonly, used, to, combat, mrsa, vancomycin, inhibits, the, synthesis, of, peptidoglycan, but, unlike, lactam, antibiotics, glycopeptide, antibiotics, target, and, bind, to, amino, acids, in, the, cell, wall, preventing, peptidoglycan, cross, linkages, from, forming, mrsa, strains, are, most, often, found, associated, with, institutions, such, as, hospitals, but, are, becoming, increasingly, prevalent, in, community, acquired, infections, minor, skin, infections, can, be, treated, with, triple, antibiotic, ointment, one, topical, agent, that, is, prescribed, is, mupirocin, a, protein, synthesis, inhibitor, that, is, produced, naturally, by, pseudomonas, fluorescens, and, has, seen, success, for, treatment, of, s, aureus, nasal, carriage, staphylococcus, aureus, was, found, to, be, the, second, leading, pathogen, for, deaths, associated, with, antimicrobial, resistance, in, 2019, staphylococcal, resistance, to, penicillin, is, mediated, by, penicillinase, a, form, of, beta, lactamase, production, an, enzyme, that, cleaves, the, lactam, ring, of, the, penicillin, molecule, rendering, the, antibiotic, ineffective, penicillinase, resistant, lactam, antibiotics, such, as, methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and, flucloxacillin, are, able, to, resist, degradation, by, staphylococcal, penicillinase, resistance, to, methicillin, is, mediated, via, the, mec, operon, part, of, the, staphylococcal, cassette, chromosome, mec, scc, mec, sccmec, is, a, family, of, mobile, genetic, elements, which, is, a, major, driving, force, of, s, aureus, evolution, resistance, is, conferred, by, the, meca, gene, which, codes, for, an, altered, penicillin, binding, protein, pbp2a, or, pbp2, that, has, a, lower, affinity, for, binding, lactams, penicillins, cephalosporins, and, carbapenems, this, allows, for, resistance, to, all, lactam, antibiotics, and, obviates, their, clinical, use, during, mrsa, infections, studies, have, explained, that, this, mobile, genetic, element, has, been, acquired, by, different, lineages, in, separate, gene, transfer, events, indicating, that, there, is, not, a, common, ancestor, of, differing, mrsa, strains, interestingly, one, study, suggests, that, mrsa, sacrifices, virulence, for, example, toxin, production, and, invasiveness, for, survival, and, creation, of, biofilms, aminoglycoside, antibiotics, such, as, kanamycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, were, once, effective, against, staphylococcal, infections, until, strains, evolved, mechanisms, to, inhibit, the, aminoglycosides, action, which, occurs, via, protonated, amine, and, or, hydroxyl, interactions, with, the, ribosomal, rna, of, the, bacterial, 30s, ribosomal, subunit, three, main, mechanisms, of, aminoglycoside, resistance, mechanisms, are, currently, and, widely, accepted, aminoglycoside, modifying, enzymes, ribosomal, mutations, and, active, efflux, of, the, drug, out, of, the, bacteria, aminoglycoside, modifying, enzymes, inactivate, the, aminoglycoside, by, covalently, attaching, either, a, phosphate, nucleotide, or, acetyl, moiety, to, either, the, amine, or, the, alcohol, key, functional, group, or, both, groups, of, the, antibiotic, this, changes, the, charge, or, sterically, hinders, the, antibiotic, decreasing, its, ribosomal, binding, affinity, in, s, aureus, the, best, characterized, aminoglycoside, modifying, enzyme, is, aminoglycoside, adenylyltransferase, 4, ia, ant, 4, ia, this, enzyme, has, been, solved, by, x, ray, crystallography, the, enzyme, is, able, to, attach, an, adenyl, moiety, to, the, 4, hydroxyl, group, of, many, aminoglycosides, including, kanamycin, and, gentamicin, glycopeptide, resistance, is, typically, mediated, by, acquisition, of, the, vana, gene, which, originates, from, the, tn1546, transposon, found, in, a, plasmid, in, enterococci, and, codes, for, an, enzyme, that, produces, an, alternative, peptidoglycan, to, which, vancomycin, will, not, bind, today, s, aureus, has, become, resistant, to, many, commonly, used, antibiotics, in, the, uk, only, 2, of, all, s, aureus, isolates, are, sensitive, to, penicillin, with, a, similar, picture, in, the, rest, of, the, world, the, lactamase, resistant, penicillins, methicillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, and, flucloxacillin, were, developed, to, treat, penicillin, resistant, s, aureus, and, are, still, used, as, first, line, treatment, methicillin, was, the, first, antibiotic, in, this, class, to, be, used, it, was, introduced, in, 1959, but, only, two, years, later, the, first, case, of, methicillin, resistant, staphylococcus, aureus, mrsa, was, reported, in, england, despite, this, mrsa, generally, remained, an, uncommon, finding, even, in, hospital, settings, until, the, 1990s, when, the, mrsa, prevalence, in, hospitals, exploded, and, it, is, now, endemic, now, methicillin, resistant, staphylococcus, aureus, mrsa, is, not, only, a, human, pathogen, causing, a, variety, of, infections, such, as, skin, and, soft, tissue, infection, ssti, pneumonia, and, sepsis, but, it, also, can, cause, disease, in, animals, known, as, livestock, associated, mrsa, la, mrsa, mrsa, infections, in, both, the, hospital, and, community, setting, are, commonly, treated, with, non, lactam, antibiotics, such, as, clindamycin, a, lincosamine, and, co, trimoxazole, also, commonly, known, as, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, resistance, to, these, antibiotics, has, also, led, to, the, use, of, new, broad, spectrum, anti, gram, positive, antibiotics, such, as, linezolid, because, of, its, availability, as, an, oral, drug, first, line, treatment, for, serious, invasive, infections, due, to, mrsa, is, currently, glycopeptide, antibiotics, vancomycin, and, teicoplanin, a, number, of, problems, with, these, antibiotics, occur, such, as, the, need, for, intravenous, administration, no, oral, preparation, is, available, toxicity, and, the, need, to, monitor, drug, levels, regularly, by, blood, tests, also, glycopeptide, antibiotics, do, not, penetrate, very, well, into, infected, tissues, this, is, a, particular, concern, with, infections, of, the, brain, and, meninges, and, in, endocarditis, glycopeptides, must, not, be, used, to, treat, methicillin, sensitive, s, aureus, mssa, as, outcomes, are, inferior, because, of, the, high, level, of, resistance, to, penicillins, and, because, of, the, potential, for, mrsa, to, develop, resistance, to, vancomycin, the, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, has, published, guidelines, archived, 2006, 09, 23, at, the, wayback, machine, for, the, appropriate, use, of, vancomycin, in, situations, where, the, incidence, of, mrsa, infections, is, known, to, be, high, the, attending, physician, may, choose, to, use, a, glycopeptide, antibiotic, until, the, identity, of, the, infecting, organism, is, known, after, the, infection, is, confirmed, to, be, due, to, a, methicillin, susceptible, strain, of, s, aureus, treatment, can, be, changed, to, flucloxacillin, or, even, penicillin, as, appropriate, vancomycin, resistant, s, aureus, vrsa, is, a, strain, of, s, aureus, that, has, become, resistant, to, the, glycopeptides, the, first, case, of, vancomycin, intermediate, s, aureus, visa, was, reported, in, japan, in, 1996, but, the, first, case, of, s, aureus, truly, resistant, to, glycopeptide, antibiotics, was, only, reported, in, 2002, three, cases, of, vrsa, infection, had, been, reported, in, the, united, states, as, of, 2005, at, least, in, part, the, antimicrobial, resistance, in, s, aureus, can, be, explained, by, its, ability, to, adapt, multiple, two, component, signal, transduction, pathways, helps, s, aureus, to, express, genes, that, are, required, to, survive, under, antimicrobial, stress, among, the, various, mechanisms, that, mrsa, acquires, to, elude, antibiotic, resistance, e, g, drug, inactivation, target, alteration, reduction, of, permeability, there, is, also, the, overexpression, of, efflux, pumps, efflux, pumps, are, membrane, integrated, proteins, that, are, physiologically, needed, in, the, cell, for, the, exportation, of, xenobiotic, compounds, they, are, divided, into, six, families, each, of, which, has, a, different, structure, function, and, transport, of, energy, the, main, efflux, pumps, of, s, aureus, are, the, mfs, major, facilitator, superfamily, which, includes, the, mdea, pump, as, well, as, the, nora, pump, and, the, mate, multidrug, and, toxin, extrusion, to, which, it, belongs, the, mepa, pump, for, transport, these, families, use, an, electrochemical, potential, and, an, ion, concentration, gradient, while, the, atp, binding, cassette, abc, family, acquires, its, energy, from, the, hydrolysis, of, atp, these, pumps, are, overexpressed, by, mdr, s, aureus, multidrug, resistant, s, aureus, and, the, result, is, an, excessive, expulsion, of, the, antibiotic, outside, the, cell, which, makes, its, action, ineffective, efflux, pumps, also, contribute, significantly, to, the, development, of, impenetrable, biofilms, by, directly, modulating, efflux, pumps, activity, or, decreasing, their, expression, it, may, be, possible, to, modify, the, resistant, phenotype, and, restore, the, effectiveness, of, existing, antibiotics, about, 33, of, the, u, s, population, are, carriers, of, s, aureus, and, about, 2, carry, mrsa, even, healthcare, providers, can, be, mrsa, colonizers, the, carriage, of, s, aureus, is, an, important, source, of, hospital, acquired, infection, also, called, nosocomial, and, community, acquired, mrsa, although, s, aureus, can, be, present, on, the, skin, of, the, host, a, large, proportion, of, its, carriage, is, through, the, anterior, nares, of, the, nasal, passages, and, can, further, be, present, in, the, ears, the, ability, of, the, nasal, passages, to, harbour, s, aureus, results, from, a, combination, of, a, weakened, or, defective, host, immunity, and, the, bacterium, s, ability, to, evade, host, innate, immunity, nasal, carriage, is, also, implicated, in, the, occurrence, of, staph, infections, spread, of, s, aureus, including, mrsa, generally, is, through, human, to, human, contact, although, recently, some, veterinarians, have, discovered, the, infection, can, be, spread, through, pets, with, environmental, contamination, thought, to, play, a, relatively, less, important, part, emphasis, on, basic, hand, washing, techniques, are, therefore, effective, in, preventing, its, transmission, the, use, of, disposable, aprons, and, gloves, by, staff, reduces, skin, to, skin, contact, so, further, reduces, the, risk, of, transmission, recently, myriad, cases, of, s, aureus, have, been, reported, in, hospitals, across, america, transmission, of, the, pathogen, is, facilitated, in, medical, settings, where, healthcare, worker, hygiene, is, insufficient, s, aureus, is, an, incredibly, hardy, bacterium, as, was, shown, in, a, study, where, it, survived, on, polyester, for, just, under, three, months, polyester, is, the, main, material, used, in, hospital, privacy, curtains, the, bacteria, are, transported, on, the, hands, of, healthcare, workers, who, may, pick, them, up, from, a, seemingly, healthy, patient, carrying, a, benign, or, commensal, strain, of, s, aureus, and, then, pass, it, on, to, the, next, patient, being, treated, introduction, of, the, bacteria, into, the, bloodstream, can, lead, to, various, complications, including, endocarditis, meningitis, and, if, it, is, widespread, sepsis, ethanol, has, proven, to, be, an, effective, topical, sanitizer, against, mrsa, quaternary, ammonium, can, be, used, in, conjunction, with, ethanol, to, increase, the, duration, of, the, sanitizing, action, the, prevention, of, nosocomial, infections, involves, routine, and, terminal, cleaning, nonflammable, alcohol, vapor, in, co, 2, nav, co, 2, systems, have, an, advantage, as, they, do, not, attack, metals, or, plastics, used, in, medical, environments, and, do, not, contribute, to, antibacterial, resistance, an, important, and, previously, unrecognized, means, of, community, associated, mrsa, colonization, and, transmission, is, during, sexual, contact, staphylococcus, aureus, is, killed, in, one, minute, at, 78, c, and, in, ten, minutes, at, 64, c, but, is, resistant, to, freezing, certain, strains, of, s, aureus, have, been, described, as, being, resistant, to, chlorine, disinfection, the, use, of, mupirocin, ointment, can, reduce, the, rate, of, infections, due, to, nasal, carriage, of, s, aureus, there, is, limited, evidence, that, nasal, decontamination, of, s, aureus, using, antibiotics, or, antiseptics, can, reduce, the, rates, of, surgical, site, infections, as, of, 2021, no, approved, vaccine, exists, against, s, aureus, early, clinical, trials, have, been, conducted, for, several, vaccines, candidates, such, as, nabi, s, staphvax, and, pentastaph, intercell, s, merck, s, v710, vri, s, sa75, and, others, while, some, of, these, vaccines, candidates, have, shown, immune, responses, others, aggravated, an, infection, by, s, aureus, to, date, none, of, these, candidates, provides, protection, against, a, s, aureus, infection, the, development, of, nabi, s, staphvax, was, stopped, in, 2005, after, phase, iii, trials, failed, intercell, s, first, v710, vaccine, variant, was, terminated, during, phase, ii, iii, after, higher, mortality, and, morbidity, were, observed, among, patients, who, developed, s, aureus, infection, nabi, s, enhanced, s, aureus, vaccines, candidate, pentastaph, was, sold, in, 2011, to, glaxosmithkline, biologicals, s, a, the, current, status, of, pentastaph, is, unclear, a, who, document, indicates, that, pentastaph, failed, in, the, phase, iii, trial, stage, in, 2010, glaxosmithkline, started, a, phase, 1, blind, study, to, evaluate, its, gsk2392103a, vaccine, as, of, 2016, this, vaccine, is, no, longer, under, active, development, pfizer, s, s, aureus, four, antigen, vaccine, sa4ag, was, granted, fast, track, designation, by, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, in, february, 2014, in, 2015, pfizer, has, commenced, a, phase, 2b, trial, regarding, the, sa4ag, vaccine, phase, 1, results, published, in, february, 2017, showed, a, very, robust, and, secure, immunogenicity, of, sa4ag, the, vaccine, underwent, clinical, trial, until, june, 2019, with, results, published, in, september, 2020, that, did, not, demonstrate, a, significant, reduction, in, postoperative, bloodstream, infection, after, surgery, in, 2015, novartis, vaccines, and, diagnostics, a, former, division, of, novartis, and, now, part, of, glaxosmithkline, published, promising, pre, clinical, results, of, their, four, component, staphylococcus, aureus, vaccine, 4c, staph, in, addition, to, vaccine, development, research, is, being, performed, to, develop, alternative, treatment, options, that, are, effective, against, antibiotic, resistant, strains, including, mrsa, examples, of, alternative, treatments, are, phage, therapy, antimicrobial, peptides, and, host, directed, therapy, a, number, of, standard, strains, of, s, aureus, called, type, cultures, are, used, in, research, and, in, laboratory, testing, such, as
