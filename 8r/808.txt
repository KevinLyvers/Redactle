the, wild, boar, sus, scrofa, also, known, as, the, wild, swine, common, wild, pig, eurasian, wild, pig, or, simply, wild, pig, is, a, suid, native, to, much, of, eurasia, and, north, africa, and, has, been, introduced, to, the, americas, and, oceania, the, species, is, now, one, of, the, widest, ranging, mammals, in, the, world, as, well, as, the, most, widespread, suiform, it, has, been, assessed, as, least, concern, on, the, iucn, red, list, due, to, its, wide, range, high, numbers, and, adaptability, to, a, diversity, of, habitats, it, has, become, an, invasive, species, in, part, of, its, introduced, range, wild, boars, probably, originated, in, southeast, asia, during, the, early, pleistocene, and, outcompeted, other, suid, species, as, they, spread, throughout, the, old, world, as, of, 2005, up, to, 16, subspecies, are, recognized, which, are, divided, into, four, regional, groupings, based, on, skull, height, and, lacrimal, bone, length, the, species, lives, in, matriarchal, societies, consisting, of, interrelated, females, and, their, young, both, male, and, female, fully, grown, males, are, usually, solitary, outside, the, breeding, season, the, wolf, is, the, wild, boar, s, main, predator, in, most, of, its, natural, range, except, in, the, far, east, and, the, lesser, sunda, islands, where, it, is, replaced, by, the, tiger, and, komodo, dragon, respectively, the, wild, boar, has, a, long, history, of, association, with, humans, having, been, the, ancestor, of, most, domestic, pig, breeds, and, a, big, game, animal, for, millennia, boars, have, also, re, hybridized, in, recent, decades, with, feral, pigs, these, boar, pig, hybrids, have, become, a, serious, pest, wild, animal, in, the, americas, and, australia, as, true, wild, boars, became, extinct, in, great, britain, before, the, development, of, modern, english, the, same, terms, are, often, used, for, both, true, wild, boar, and, pigs, especially, large, or, semi, wild, ones, the, english, boar, stems, from, the, old, english, b, r, which, is, thought, to, be, derived, from, the, west, germanic, bair, of, unknown, origin, boar, is, sometimes, used, specifically, to, refer, to, males, and, may, also, be, used, to, refer, to, male, domesticated, pigs, especially, breeding, males, that, have, not, been, castrated, sow, the, traditional, name, for, a, female, again, comes, from, old, english, and, germanic, it, stems, from, proto, indo, european, and, is, related, to, the, latin, sus, and, greek, hus, and, more, closely, to, the, new, high, german, sau, the, young, may, be, called, piglets, or, boarlets, the, animals, specific, name, scrofa, is, latin, for, sow, in, hunting, terminology, boars, are, given, different, designations, according, to, their, age, mtdna, studies, indicate, that, the, wild, boar, originated, from, islands, in, southeast, asia, such, as, indonesia, and, the, philippines, and, subsequently, spread, onto, mainland, eurasia, and, north, africa, the, earliest, fossil, finds, of, the, species, come, from, both, europe, and, asia, and, date, back, to, the, early, pleistocene, by, the, late, villafranchian, s, scrofa, largely, displaced, the, related, s, strozzii, a, large, possibly, swamp, adapted, suid, ancestral, to, the, modern, s, verrucosus, throughout, the, eurasian, mainland, restricting, it, to, insular, asia, its, closest, wild, relative, is, the, bearded, pig, of, malacca, and, surrounding, islands, as, of, 2005, 16, subspecies, are, recognised, which, are, divided, into, four, regional, groupings, sahariensis, heim, de, balzac, 1937, nipponicus, heude, 1899, mediterraneus, ulmansky, 1911, reiseri, bolkay, 1925, sardous, str, bel, 1882, with, the, exception, of, domestic, pigs, in, timor, and, papua, new, guinea, which, appear, to, be, of, sulawesi, warty, pig, stock, the, wild, boar, is, the, ancestor, of, most, pig, breeds, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, pigs, were, domesticated, from, wild, boar, as, early, as, 13, 000, 12, 700, bce, in, the, near, east, in, the, tigris, basin, being, managed, in, the, wild, in, a, way, similar, to, the, way, they, are, managed, by, some, modern, new, guineans, remains, of, pigs, have, been, dated, to, earlier, than, 11, 400, bce, in, cyprus, those, animals, must, have, been, introduced, from, the, mainland, which, suggests, domestication, in, the, adjacent, mainland, by, then, there, was, also, a, separate, domestication, in, china, which, took, place, about, 8, 000, years, ago, dna, evidence, from, sub, fossil, remains, of, teeth, and, jawbones, of, neolithic, pigs, shows, that, the, first, domestic, pigs, in, europe, had, been, brought, from, the, near, east, this, stimulated, the, domestication, of, local, european, wild, boars, resulting, in, a, third, domestication, event, with, the, near, eastern, genes, dying, out, in, european, pig, stock, modern, domesticated, pigs, have, involved, complex, exchanges, with, european, domesticated, lines, being, exported, in, turn, to, the, ancient, near, east, historical, records, indicate, that, asian, pigs, were, introduced, into, europe, during, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, domestic, pigs, tend, to, have, much, more, developed, hindquarters, than, their, wild, boar, ancestors, to, the, point, where, 70, of, their, body, weight, is, concentrated, in, the, posterior, which, is, the, opposite, of, wild, boar, where, most, of, the, muscles, are, concentrated, on, the, head, and, shoulders, the, heude, s, pig, sus, bucculentus, also, known, as, the, indochinese, warty, pig, or, vietnam, warty, pig, was, an, alleged, pig, species, found, in, laos, and, vietnam, it, was, virtually, unknown, and, was, feared, extinct, until, the, discovery, of, a, skull, from, a, recently, killed, individual, in, the, annamite, range, laos, in, 1995, subsequent, studies, indicated, that, sus, bucculentus, was, not, a, valid, taxon, as, of, 2022, the, mammal, diversity, database, included, it, in, sus, scrofa, the, wild, boar, is, a, bulky, massively, built, suid, with, short, and, relatively, thin, legs, the, trunk, is, short, and, robust, while, the, hindquarters, are, comparatively, underdeveloped, the, region, behind, the, shoulder, blades, rises, into, a, hump, and, the, neck, is, short, and, thick, to, the, point, of, being, nearly, immobile, the, animal, s, head, is, very, large, taking, up, to, one, third, of, the, body, s, entire, length, the, structure, of, the, head, is, well, suited, for, digging, the, head, acts, as, a, plough, while, the, powerful, neck, muscles, allow, the, animal, to, upturn, considerable, amounts, of, soil, it, is, capable, of, digging, 8, 10, cm, 3, 1, 3, 9, in, into, frozen, ground, and, can, upturn, rocks, weighing, 40, 50, kg, 88, 110, lb, the, eyes, are, small, and, deep, set, and, the, ears, long, and, broad, the, species, has, well, developed, canine, teeth, which, protrude, from, the, mouths, of, adult, males, the, medial, hooves, are, larger, and, more, elongated, than, the, lateral, ones, and, are, capable, of, quick, movements, the, animal, can, run, at, a, maximum, speed, of, 40, km, h, 25, mph, and, jump, at, a, height, of, 140, 150, cm, 55, 59, in, sexual, dimorphism, is, very, pronounced, in, the, species, with, males, being, typically, 5, 10, larger, and, 20, 30, heavier, than, females, males, also, sport, a, mane, running, down, the, back, which, is, particularly, apparent, during, autumn, and, winter, the, canine, teeth, are, also, much, more, prominent, in, males, and, grow, throughout, life, the, upper, canines, are, relatively, short, and, grow, sideways, early, in, life, though, they, gradually, curve, upwards, the, lower, canines, are, much, sharper, and, longer, with, the, exposed, parts, measuring, 10, 12, cm, 3, 9, 4, 7, in, in, length, in, the, breeding, period, males, develop, a, coating, of, subcutaneous, tissue, which, may, be, 2, 3, cm, 0, 79, 1, 18, in, thick, extending, from, the, shoulder, blades, to, the, rump, thus, protecting, vital, organs, during, fights, males, sport, a, roughly, chicken, egg, sized, sac, of, unclear, function, near, the, opening, of, the, penis, that, collects, urine, and, emits, a, sharp, odour, adult, size, and, weight, is, largely, determined, by, environmental, factors, boars, living, in, arid, areas, with, little, productivity, tend, to, attain, smaller, sizes, than, their, counterparts, inhabiting, areas, with, abundant, food, and, water, in, most, of, europe, males, average, 75, 100, kg, 165, 220, lb, in, weight, 75, 80, cm, 30, 31, in, in, shoulder, height, and, 150, cm, 59, in, in, body, length, whereas, females, average, 60, 80, kg, 130, 180, lb, in, weight, 70, cm, 28, in, in,

central, europe, the, largest, males, weigh, 200, kg, 440, lb, and, females, 120, kg, 260, lb, in, northeastern, asia, large, males, can, reach, brown, bear, like, sizes, weighing, 270, kg, 600, lb, and, measuring, 110, 118, cm, 43, 46, in, in, shoulder, height, some, adult, males, in, ussuriland, and, manchuria, have, been, recorded, to, weigh, 300, 350, kg, 660, 770, lb, and, measure, 125, cm, 49, in, in, shoulder, height, adults, of, this, size, are, generally, immune, from, wolf, predation, such, giants, are, rare, in, modern, times, as, past, overhunting, has, prevented, animals, from, attaining, their, full, growth, the, winter, coat, consists, of, long, coarse, bristles, underlaid, with, short, brown, downy, fur, the, length, of, these, bristles, varies, along, the, body, with, the, shortest, being, around, the, face, and, limbs, and, the, longest, running, along, the, back, these, back, bristles, form, the, aforementioned, mane, prominent, in, males, and, stand, erect, when, the, animal, is, agitated, colour, is, highly, variable, specimens, around, lake, balkhash, are, very, lightly, coloured, and, can, even, be, white, while, some, boars, from, belarus, and, ussuriland, can, be, black, some, subspecies, sport, a, light, coloured, patch, running, backward, from, the, corners, of, the, mouth, coat, colour, also, varies, with, age, with, piglets, having, light, brown, or, rusty, brown, fur, with, pale, bands, extending, from, the, flanks, and, back, the, wild, boar, produces, a, number, of, different, sounds, which, are, divided, into, three, categories, its, sense, of, smell, is, very, well, developed, to, the, point, that, the, animal, is, used, for, drug, detection, in, germany, its, hearing, is, also, acute, though, its, eyesight, is, comparatively, weak, lacking, color, vision, and, being, unable, to, recognise, a, standing, human, 10, 15, metres, 33, 49, ft, away, pigs, are, one, of, four, known, mammalian, taxa, which, possess, mutations, in, the, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptor, that, protect, against, snake, venom, mongooses, honey, badgers, hedgehogs, and, pigs, all, have, modifications, to, the, receptor, pocket, which, prevents, the, snake, venom, neurotoxin, from, binding, these, represent, four, separate, independent, mutations, boars, are, typically, social, animals, living, in, female, dominated, sounders, consisting, of, barren, sows, and, mothers, with, young, led, by, an, old, matriarch, male, boars, leave, their, sounder, at, the, age, of, 8, 15, months, while, females, either, remain, with, their, mothers, or, establish, new, territories, nearby, subadult, males, may, live, in, loosely, knit, groups, while, adult, and, elderly, males, tend, to, be, solitary, outside, the, breeding, season, the, breeding, period, in, most, areas, lasts, from, november, to, january, though, most, mating, only, lasts, a, month, and, a, half, prior, to, mating, the, males, develop, their, subcutaneous, armour, in, preparation, for, confronting, rivals, the, testicles, double, in, size, and, the, glands, secrete, a, foamy, yellowish, liquid, once, ready, to, reproduce, males, travel, long, distances, in, search, of, a, sounder, of, sows, eating, little, on, the, way, once, a, sounder, has, been, located, the, male, drives, off, all, young, animals, and, persistently, chases, the, sows, at, this, point, the, male, fiercely, fights, potential, rivals, a, single, male, can, mate, with, 5, 10, sows, by, the, end, of, the, rut, males, are, often, badly, mauled, and, have, lost, 20, of, their, body, weight, with, bite, induced, injuries, to, the, penis, being, common, the, gestation, period, varies, according, to, the, age, of, the, expecting, mother, for, first, time, breeders, it, lasts, 114, 130, days, while, it, lasts, 133, 140, days, in, older, sows, farrowing, occurs, between, march, and, may, with, litter, sizes, depending, on, the, age, and, nutrition, of, the, mother, the, average, litter, consists, of, 4, 6, piglets, with, the, maximum, being, 10, 12, the, piglets, are, whelped, in, a, nest, constructed, from, twigs, grasses, and, leaves, should, the, mother, die, prematurely, the, piglets, are, adopted, by, the, other, sows, in, the, sounder, newborn, piglets, weigh, around, 600, 1, 000, grams, lacking, underfur, and, bearing, a, single, milk, incisor, and, canine, on, each, half, of, the, jaw, there, is, intense, competition, between, the, piglets, over, the, most, milk, rich, nipples, as, the, best, fed, young, grow, faster, and, have, stronger, constitutions, the, piglets, do, not, leave, the, lair, for, their, first, week, of, life, should, the, mother, be, absent, the, piglets, lie, closely, pressed, to, each, other, by, two, weeks, of, age, the, piglets, begin, accompanying, their, mother, on, her, journeys, should, danger, be, detected, the, piglets, take, cover, or, stand, immobile, relying, on, their, camouflage, to, keep, them, hidden, the, neonatal, coat, fades, after, three, months, with, adult, colouration, being, attained, at, eight, months, although, the, lactation, period, lasts, 2, 5, 3, 5, months, the, piglets, begin, displaying, adult, feeding, behaviours, at, the, age, of, 2, 3, weeks, the, permanent, dentition, is, fully, formed, by, 1, 2, years, with, the, exception, of, the, canines, in, males, the, teeth, stop, growing, during, the, middle, of, the, fourth, year, the, canines, in, old, males, continue, to, grow, throughout, their, lives, curving, strongly, as, they, age, sows, attain, sexual, maturity, at, the, age, of, one, year, with, males, attaining, it, a, year, later, however, estrus, usually, first, occurs, after, two, years, in, sows, while, males, begin, participating, in, the, rut, after, 4, 5, years, as, they, are, not, permitted, to, mate, by, the, older, males, the, maximum, lifespan, in, the, wild, is, 10, 14, years, though, few, specimens, survive, past, 4, 5, years, boars, in, captivity, have, lived, for, 20, years, the, wild, boar, inhabits, a, diverse, array, of, habitats, from, boreal, taigas, to, deserts, in, mountainous, regions, it, can, even, occupy, alpine, zones, occurring, up, to, 1, 900, m, 6, 200, ft, in, the, carpathians, 2, 600, m, 8, 500, ft, in, the, caucasus, and, up, to, 3, 600, 4, 000, m, 11, 800, 13, 100, ft, in, the, mountains, in, central, asia, and, kazakhstan, in, order, to, survive, in, a, given, area, wild, boars, require, a, habitat, fulfilling, three, conditions, heavily, brushed, areas, providing, shelter, from, predators, water, for, drinking, and, bathing, purposes, and, an, absence, of, regular, snowfall, the, main, habitats, favored, by, boars, in, europe, are, deciduous, and, mixed, forests, with, the, most, favorable, areas, consisting, of, forest, composed, of, oak, and, beech, enclosing, marshes, and, meadows, in, the, bia, owie, a, forest, the, animal, s, primary, habitat, consists, of, well, developed, broad, leaved, and, mixed, forests, along, with, marshy, mixed, forests, with, coniferous, forests, and, undergrowths, being, of, secondary, importance, forests, made, up, entirely, of, oak, groves, and, beeches, are, used, only, during, the, fruit, bearing, season, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, caucasian, and, transcaucasian, mountain, areas, where, boars, will, occupy, such, fruit, bearing, forests, year, round, in, the, mountainous, areas, of, the, russian, far, east, the, species, inhabits, nutpine, groves, hilly, mixed, forests, where, mongolian, oak, and, korean, pine, are, present, swampy, mixed, taiga, and, coastal, oak, forests, in, transbaikalia, boars, are, restricted, to, river, valleys, with, nut, pine, and, shrubs, boars, are, regularly, encountered, in, pistachio, groves, in, winter, in, some, areas, of, tajikistan, and, turkmenistan, while, in, spring, they, migrate, to, open, deserts, boar, have, also, colonized, deserts, in, several, areas, they, have, been, introduced, to, on, the, islands, of, komodo, and, rinca, the, boar, mostly, inhabits, savanna, or, open, monsoon, forests, avoiding, heavily, forested, areas, unless, pursued, by, humans, wild, boar, are, known, to, be, competent, swimmers, capable, of, covering, long, distances, in, 2013, one, boar, was, reported, to, have, completed, the, 11, kilometre, 7, mi, swim, from, france, to, alderney, in, the, channel, islands, due, to, concerns, about, disease, it, was, shot, and, incinerated, wild, boar, rest, in, shelters, which, contain, insulating, material, like, spruce, branches, and, dry, hay, these, resting, places, are, occupied, by, whole, families, though, males, lie, separately, and, are, often, located, in, the, vicinity, of, streams, in, swamp, forests, and, in, tall, grass, or, shrub, thickets, boars, never, defecate, in, their, shelters, and, will, cover, themselves, with, soil, and, pine, needles, when, irritated, by, insects, the, wild, boar, is, a, highly, versatile, omnivore, whose, diversity, in, choice, of, food, is, comparable, to, that, of, humans, their, foods, can, be, divided, into, four, categories, a, 50, kg, 110, lb, boar, needs, around, 4, 000, 4, 500, calories, of, food, per, day, though, this, required, amount, increases, during, winter, and, pregnancy, with, the, majority, of, its, diet, consisting, of, food, items, dug, from, the, ground, like, underground, plant, material, and, burrowing, animals, acorns, and, beechnuts, are, invariably, its, most, important, food, items, in, temperate, zones, as, they, are, rich, in, the, carbohydrates, necessary, for, the, buildup, of, fat, reserves, needed, to, survive, lean, periods, in, western, europe, underground, plant, material, favoured, by, boars, includes, bracken, willow, herb, bulbs, meadow, herb, roots, and, bulbs, and, the, bulbs, of, cultivated, crops, such, food, is, favoured, in, early, spring, and, summer, but, may, also, be, eaten, in, autumn, and, winter, during, beechnut, and, acorn, crop, failures, should, regular, wild, foods, become, scarce, boars, will, eat, tree, bark, and, fungi, as, well, as, visit, cultivated, potato, and, artichoke, fields, boar, soil, disturbance, and, foraging, have, been, shown, to, facilitate, invasive, plants, boars, of, the, vittatus, subspecies, in, ujung, kulon, national, park, in, java, differ, from, most, other, populations, by, their, primarily, frugivorous, diet, which, consists, of, 50, different, fruit, species, especially, figs, thus, making, them, important, seed, dispersers, the, wild, boar, can, consume, numerous, genera, of, poisonous, plants, without, ill, effect, including, aconitum, anemone, calla, caltha, ferula, and, pteridium, boars, may, occasionally, prey, on, small, vertebrates, like, newborn, deer, fawns, leporids, and, galliform, chicks, boars, inhabiting, the, volga, delta, and, near, some, lakes, and, rivers, of, kazakhstan, have, been, recorded, to, feed, extensively, on, fish, like, carp, and, caspian, roach, boars, in, the, former, area, will, also, feed, on, cormorant, and, heron, chicks, bivalved, molluscs, trapped, muskrats, and, mice, there, is, at, least, one, record, of, a, boar, killing, and, eating, a, bonnet, macaque, in, southern, india, s, bandipur, national, park, though, this, may, have, been, a, case, of, intraguild, predation, brought, on, by, interspecific, competition, for, human, handouts, there, is, also, at, least, one, recorded, case, of, a, group, of, wild, boar, attacking, killing, and, eating, an, adult, healthy, female, axis, deer, axis, axis, as, a, pack, piglets, are, vulnerable, to, attack, from, medium, sized, felids, like, eurasian, lynx, lynx, lynx, jungle, cats, felis, chaus, and, snow, leopards, panthera, uncia, as, well, as, other, carnivorans, like, brown, bears, ursus, arctos, and, yellow, throated, martens, martes, flavigula, the, wolf, canis, lupus, is, the, main, predator, of, wild, boar, throughout, most, of, its, range, a, single, wolf, can, kill, around, 50, to, 80, boars, of, differing, ages, in, one, year, in, italy, and, belarus, belovezhskaya, pushcha, national, park, boars, are, the, wolf, s, primary, prey, despite, an, abundance, of, alternative, less, powerful, ungulates, wolves, are, particularly, threatening, during, the, winter, when, deep, snow, impedes, the, boars, movements, in, the, baltic, regions, heavy, snowfall, can, allow, wolves, to, eliminate, boars, from, an, area, almost, completely, wolves, primarily, target, piglets, and, subadults, and, only, rarely, attack, adult, sows, adult, males, are, usually, avoided, entirely, dholes, cuon, alpinus, may, also, prey, on, boars, to, the, point, of, keeping, their, numbers, down, in, northwestern, bhutan, despite, there, being, many, more, cattle, in, the, area, leopards, panthera, pardus, are, predators, of, wild, boar, in, the, caucasus, particularly, transcaucasia, the, russian, far, east, india, china, and, iran, in, most, areas, boars, constitute, only, a, small, part, of, the, leopard, s, diet, however, in, iran, s, sarigol, national, park, boars, are, the, second, most, frequently, targeted, prey, species, after, mouflon, ovis, gmelini, though, adult, individuals, are, generally, avoided, as, they, are, above, the, leopard, s, preferred, weight, range, of, 10, 40, kg, 22, 88, lb, this, dependence, on, wild, boar, is, largely, due, in, part, to, the, local, leopard, subspecies, large, size, boars, of, all, ages, were, once, the, primary, prey, of, the, tiger, panthera, tigris, in, transcaucasia, kazakhstan, middle, asia, and, the, far, east, up, until, the, late, 19th, century, in, modern, times, tiger, numbers, are, too, low, to, have, a, limiting, effect, on, boar, populations, a, single, tiger, can, systematically, destroy, an, entire, sounder, by, preying, on, its, members, one, by, one, before, moving, on, to, another, sounder, tigers, have, been, noted, to, chase, boars, for, longer, distances, than, with, other, prey, in, two, rare, cases, boars, were, reported, to, gore, a, small, tiger, and, a, tigress, to, death, in, self, defense, a, large, male, tiger, died, of, wounds, inflicted, by, an, old, wild, boar, it, had, killed, in, a, battle, royal, between, the, two, animals, 500, in, the, amur, region, wild, boars, are, one, of, the, two, most, important, prey, species, for, siberian, tigers, alongside, the, manchurian, wapiti, cervus, canadensis, xanthopygus, with, the, two, species, collectively, comprising, roughly, 80, of, the, felid, s, prey, in, sikhote, alin, a, tiger, can, kill, 30, 34, boars, a, year, studies, of, tigers, in, india, indicate, that, boars, are, usually, secondary, in, preference, to, various, cervids, and, bovids, though, when, boars, are, targeted, healthy, adults, are, caught, more, frequently, than, young, and, sick, specimens, on, the, islands, of, komodo, rinca, and, flores, the, boar, s, main, predator, is, the, komodo, dragon, varanus, komodoensis, the, species, originally, occurred, in, north, africa, and, much, of, eurasia, from, the, british, isles, to, korea, and, the, sunda, islands, the, northern, limit, of, its, range, extended, from, southern, scandinavia, to, southern, siberia, and, japan, within, this, range, it, was, only, absent, in, extremely, dry, deserts, and, alpine, zones, it, was, once, found, in, north, africa, along, the, nile, valley, up, to, khartoum, and, north, of, the, sahara, the, species, occurs, on, a, few, ionian, and, aegean, islands, sometimes, swimming, between, islands, the, reconstructed, northern, boundary, of, the, animal, s, asian, range, ran, from, lake, ladoga, at, 60, n, through, the, area, of, novgorod, and, moscow, into, the, southern, urals, where, it, reached, 52, n, from, there, the, boundary, passed, ishim, and, farther, east, the, irtysh, at, 56, n, in, the, eastern, baraba, steppe, near, novosibirsk, the, boundary, turned, steep, south, encircled, the, altai, mountains, and, went, again, eastward, including, the, tannu, ola, mountains, and, lake, baikal, from, here, the, boundary, went, slightly, north, of, the, amur, river, eastward, to, its, lower, reaches, at, the, sea, of, okhotsk, on, sakhalin, there, are, only, fossil, reports, of, wild, boar, the, southern, boundaries, in, europe, and, asia, were, almost, invariably, identical, to, the, seashores, of, these, continents, it, is, absent, in, the, dry, regions, of, mongolia, from, 44, to, 46, n, southward, in, china, westward, of, sichuan, and, in, india, north, of, the, himalayas, it, is, absent, in, the, higher, elevations, of, the, pamir, and, the, tian, shan, though, they, do, occur, in, the, tarim, basin, and, on, the, lower, slopes, of, the, tien, shan, in, recent, centuries, the, range, of, wild, boar, has, changed, dramatically, largely, due, to, hunting, by, humans, and, more, recently, because, of, captive, wild, boar, escaping, into, the, wild, prior, to, the, 20th, century, boar, populations, had, declined, in, numerous, areas, with, british, populations, probably, becoming, extinct, during, the, 13th, century, in, the, warm, period, after, the, ice, age, wild, boar, lived, in, the, southern, parts, of, sweden, and, norway, and, north, of, lake, ladoga, in, karelia, it, was, previously, thought, that, the, species, did, not, live, in, finland, during, prehistory, because, no, prehistoric, wild, boar, bones, had, been, found, within, the, borders, of, the, country, it, was, not, until, 2013, when, a, wild, boar, bone, was, found, in, askola, that, the, species, was, found, to, have, lived, in, finland, more, than, 8, 000, years, ago, it, is, believed, however, that, man, prevented, its, establishment, by, hunting, in, denmark, the, last, boar, was, shot, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, and, by, 1900, they, were, absent, in, tunisia, and, sudan, and, large, areas, of, germany, austria, and, italy, in, russia, they, were, extirpated, in, wide, areas, by, the, 1930s, the, last, boar, in, egypt, reportedly, died, on, 20, december, 1912, in, the, giza, zoo, with, wild, populations, having, disappeared, by, 1894, 1902, prince, kamal, el, dine, hussein, attempted, to, repopulate, wadi, el, natrun, with, boars, of, hungarian, stock, but, they, were, quickly, exterminated, by, poachers, a, revival, of, boar, populations, began, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, by, 1950, wild, boar, had, once, again, reached, their, original, northern, boundary, in, many, parts, of, their, asiatic, range, by, 1960, they, reached, leningrad, and, moscow, and, by, 1975, they, were, to, be, found, in, archangelsk, and, astrakhan, in, the, 1970s, they, again, occurred, in, denmark, and, sweden, where, captive, animals, escaped, and, now, survive, in, the, wild, in, england, wild, boar, populations, re, established, themselves, in, the, 1990s, after, escaping, from, specialist, farms, that, had, imported, european, stock, by, the, 11th, century, wild, boars, were, apparently, already, becoming, rare, in, britain, a, 1087, forestry, law, enacted, by, william, the, conqueror, punished, through, blinding, the, unlawful, killing, of, a, boar, charles, i, attempted, to, reintroduce, the, species, into, the, new, forest, but, this, population, was, exterminated, in, the, 17th, century, during, the, english, civil, war, between, their, medieval, extinction, and, the, 1980s, when, wild, boar, farming, began, only, a, handful, of, captive, wild, boar, imported, from, the, continent, were, present, in, britain, occasional, escapes, of, wild, boar, from, wildlife, parks, have, occurred, as, early, as, the, 1970s, but, since, the, early, 1990s, significant, populations, have, re, established, themselves, after, escapes, from, farms, the, number, of, which, has, increased, as, the, demand, for, meat, from, the, species, has, grown, a, 1998, maff, now, defra, study, on, wild, boar, living, wild, in, britain, confirmed, the, presence, of, two, populations, of, wild, boar, living, in, britain, one, in, kent, east, sussex, and, another, in, dorset, another, defra, report, in, february, 2008, confirmed, the, existence, of, these, two, sites, as, established, breeding, areas, and, identified, a, third, in, gloucestershire, herefordshire, in, the, forest, of, dean, ross, on, wye, area, a, new, breeding, population, was, also, identified, in, devon, there, is, another, significant, population, in, dumfries, and, galloway, populations, estimates, were, as, follows, population, estimates, for, the, forest, of, dean, are, disputed, as, at, the, time, that, the, defra, population, estimate, was, 100, a, photo, of, a, boar, sounder, in, the, forest, near, staunton, with, over, 33, animals, visible, was, published, and, at, about, the, same, time, over, 30, boar, were, seen, in, a, field, near, the, original, escape, location, of, weston, under, penyard, many, kilometres, or, miles, away, in, early, 2010, the, forestry, commission, embarked, on, a, cull, with, the, aim, of, reducing, the, boar, population, from, an, estimated, 150, animals, to, 100, by, august, it, was, stated, that, efforts, were, being, made, to, reduce, the, population, from, 200, to, 90, but, that, only, 25, had, been, killed, the, failure, to, meet, cull, targets, was, confirmed, in, february, 2011, wild, boars, have, crossed, the, river, wye, into, monmouthshire, wales, iolo, williams, the, bbc, wales, wildlife, expert, attempted, to, film, welsh, boar, in, late, 2012, many, other, sightings, across, the, uk, have, also, been, reported, the, effects, of, wild, boar, on, the, u, k, s, woodlands, were, discussed, with, ralph, harmer, of, the, forestry, commission, on, the, bbc, radio, s, farming, today, radio, programme, in, 2011, the, programme, prompted, activist, writer, george, monbiot, to, propose, a, thorough, population, study, followed, by, the, introduction, of, permit, controlled, culling, in, scotland, wild, boar, are, professionally, referred, to, as, feral, pigs, as, the, genetics, of, the, established, feral, populations, may, come, from, a, mix, of, both, wild, boar, and, domestic, pigs, they, are, now, known, to, be, present, in, dumfries, and, galloway, and, a, number, of, sites, in, the, highlands, mainly, centred, around, the, loch, ness, area, they, can, be, killed, there, legally, without, a, license, and, are, culled, by, land, managers, as, wild, populations, appear, occasionally, as, of, 2024, an, agency, that, advises, the, scottish, government, estimates, that, scotland, is, home, to, a, few, thousand, wild, boars, locals, around, loch, ness, that, were, interviewed, by, the, new, york, times, believed, that, the, boars, were, becoming, an, increasingly, worse, problem, and, farmers, noted, that, they, had, killed, and, eaten, several, lambs, wild, boars, are, an, invasive, species, in, the, americas, having, been, introduced, by, european, explorers, and, settlers, in, the, 16th, century, to, serve, as, a, source, of, food, wild, boars, now, cause, problems, including, out, competing, native, species, for, food, destroying, the, nests, of, ground, nesting, species, killing, fawns, and, young, domestic, livestock, destroying, agricultural, crops, eating, tree, seeds, and, seedlings, destroying, native, vegetation, and, wetlands, through, wallowing, damaging, water, quality, coming, into, violent, conflict, with, humans, and, pets, and, carrying, pig, and, human, diseases, including, brucellosis, trichinosis, and, pseudorabies, in, some, jurisdictions, it, is, illegal, to, import, breed, release, possess, sell, distribute, trade, transport, hunt, or, trap, eurasian, boars, hunting, and, trapping, is, done, systematically, to, increase, the, chance, of, eradication, and, to, remove, the, incentive, to, illegally, release, boars, which, have, mostly, been, spread, deliberately, by, sport, hunters, while, domestic, pigs, both, captive, and, feral, popularly, termed, razorbacks, have, been, in, north, america, since, the, earliest, days, of, european, colonization, pure, wild, boars, were, not, introduced, into, the, new, world, until, the, 19th, century, the, suids, were, released, into, the, wild, by, wealthy, landowners, as, big, game, animals, the, initial, introductions, took, place, in, fenced, enclosures, though, several, escapes, occurred, with, the, escapees, sometimes, intermixing, with, already, established, feral, pig, populations, the, first, of, these, introductions, occurred, in, new, hampshire, in, 1890, thirteen, wild, boars, from, germany, were, purchased, by, austin, corbin, from, carl, hagenbeck, and, released, into, a, 9, 500, hectare, 23, 000, acre, game, preserve, in, sullivan, county, several, of, these, boars, escaped, though, they, were, quickly, hunted, down, by, locals, two, further, introductions, were, made, from, the, original, stocking, with, several, escapes, taking, place, due, to, breaches, in, the, game, preserve, s, fencing, these, escapees, have, ranged, widely, with, some, specimens, having, been, observed, crossing, into, vermont, in, 1902, 15, 20, wild, boar, from, germany, were, released, into, a, 3, 200, hectare, 7, 900, acre, estate, in, hamilton, county, new, york, several, specimens, escaped, six, years, later, dispersing, into, the, william, c, whitney, wilderness, area, with, their, descendants, surviving, for, at, least, 20, years, the, most, extensive, boar, introduction, in, the, us, took, place, in, western, north, carolina, in, 1912, when, 13, boars, of, undetermined, european, origin, were, released, into, two, fenced, enclosures, in, a, game, preserve, in, hooper, bald, graham, county, most, of, the, specimens, remained, in, the, preserve, for, the, next, decade, until, a, large, scale, hunt, caused, the, remaining, animals, to, break, through, their, confines, and, escape, some, of, the, boars, migrated, to, tennessee, where, they, intermixed, with, both, free, ranging, and, feral, pigs, in, the, area, in, 1924, a, dozen, hooper, bald, wild, pigs, were, shipped, to, california, and, released, in, a, property, between, carmel, valley, and, the, los, padres, national, forest, these, hybrid, boar, were, later, used, as, breeding, stock, on, various, private, and, public, lands, throughout, the, state, as, well, as, in, other, states, like, florida, georgia, south, carolina, west, virginia, and, mississippi, several, wild, boars, from, leon, springs, and, the, san, antonio, saint, louis, and, san, diego, zoos, were, released, in, the, powder, horn, ranch, in, calhoun, county, texas, in, 1939, these, specimens, escaped, and, established, themselves, in, surrounding, ranchlands, and, coastal, areas, with, some, crossing, the, espiritu, santo, bay, and, colonizing, matagorda, island, descendants, of, the, powder, horn, ranch, boars, were, later, released, onto, san, jos, island, and, the, coast, of, chalmette, louisiana, wild, boar, of, unknown, origin, were, stocked, in, a, ranch, in, the, edwards, plateau, in, the, 1940s, only, to, escape, during, a, storm, and, hybridize, with, local, feral, pig, populations, later, spreading, into, neighboring, counties, starting, in, the, mid, 1980s, several, boars, purchased, from, the, san, diego, zoo, and, tierpark, berlin, were, released, into, the, united, states, a, decade, later, more, specimens, from, farms, in, canada, and, bia, owie, a, forest, were, let, loose, in, recent, years, wild, pig, populations, have, been, reported, in, 44, states, within, the, us, most, of, which, are, likely, wild, boar, feral, hog, hybrids, pure, wild, boar, populations, may, still, be, present, but, are, extremely, localized, in, south, america, the, european, boar, is, believed, to, have, been, introduced, for, the, first, time, in, argentina, and, uruguay, around, the, 20th, century, for, breeding, purposes, in, brazil, the, creation, of, wild, boar, and, hybrids, started, on, a, large, scale, in, the, mid, 1990s, with, the, invasion, of, wild, boar, that, crossed, the, border, and, entered, rio, grande, do, sul, around, 1989, and, the, escape, and, intentional, release, by, several, brazilian, breeders, in, the, late, 1990s, in, response, to, a, ibama, decision, against, the, import, and, breeding, of, wild, boar, in, 1998, numerous, feral, species, formed, a, growing, population, which, progressively, advances, in, brazilian, territory, as, a, form, of, control, for, the, wild, boar, population, hunting, and, killing, are, allowed, for, collectors, shooters, and, hunters, cacs, duly, registered, by, the, environmental, control, agency, ibama, which, on, the, other, hand, seeks, to, encourage, the, preservation, of, similar, species, of, native, peccaries, such, as, the, queixada, and, the, caititu, wild, boars, negatively, impact, other, habitats, through, the, destruction, of, the, environment, or, homes, of, wildlife, when, wild, boars, invade, new, areas, they, adapt, to, the, new, area, by, trampling, and, rooting, as, well, as, displacing, many, saplings, nutrients, this, causes, a, decrease, in, growing, of, many, plants, and, trees, water, is, also, affected, negatively, by, wild, boars, when, wild, boars, are, active, in, streams, or, small, pools, of, water, it, causes, increased, turbidity, excessive, silt, and, particle, suspension, in, some, cases, the, fecal, coliform, concentration, increases, to, dangerous, levels, because, of, wild, boars, aquatic, wildlife, is, affected, more, prominently, fish, and, amphibians, wild, boars, have, caused, a, great, decrease, in, over, 300, animal, or, plant, species, 250, being, endangered, or, threatened, the, boars, cause, many, habitats, to, become, less, diverse, because, of, their, feeding, behaviors, and, predation, wild, boars, will, dig, up, eggs, of, species, and, eat, them, as, well, as, killing, other, wildlife, for, food, when, these, boars, compete, with, other, species, for, resources, they, usually, come, out, successful, a, study, published, in, the, journal, of, experimental, marine, biology, and, ecology, was, conducted, on, the, results, of, feral, swine, control, only, two, years, after, the, control, started, the, amount, of, turtle, nests, jumped, from, 57, to, 143, and, the, turtle, nest, predation, percent, dropped, from, 74, to, 15, they, kill, and, eat, deers, lizards, birds, snakes, and, more, these, boars, are, called, opportunist, omnivores, which, means, they, eat, almost, anything, this, means, they, can, survive, almost, anywhere, a, big, surplus, of, food, and, the, ability, to, adapt, to, any, new, place, causes, lots, of, breeding, all, of, these, factors, make, it, difficult, to, get, rid, of, wild, boars, wild, boars, are, known, to, host, at, least, 20, different, parasitic, worm, species, with, maximum, infections, occurring, in, summer, young, animals, are, vulnerable, to, helminths, like, metastrongylus, which, are, consumed, by, boars, through, earthworms, and, cause, death, by, parasitising, the, lungs, wild, boar, also, carry, parasites, known, to, infect, humans, including, gastrodiscoides, trichinella, spiralis, taenia, solium, balantidium, coli, and, toxoplasma, gondii, wild, boar, in, southern, regions, are, frequently, infested, with, ticks, dermacentor, rhipicephalus, and, hyalomma, and, hog, lice, the, species, also, suffers, from, blood, sucking, flies, which, it, escapes, by, bathing, frequently, or, hiding, in, dense, shrubs, swine, plague, spreads, very, quickly, in, wild, boar, with, epizootics, being, recorded, in, germany, poland, hungary, belarus, the, caucasus, the, far, east, kazakhstan, and, other, regions, foot, and, mouth, disease, can, also, take, on, epidemic, proportions, in, boar, populations, the, species, occasionally, but, rarely, contracts, pasteurellosis, hemorrhagic, sepsis, tularemia, and, anthrax, wild, boar, may, on, occasion, contract, swine, erysipelas, through, rodents, or, hog, lice, and, ticks, the, wild, boar, features, prominently, in, the, cultures, of, indo, european, people, many, of, which, saw, the, animal, as, embodying, warrior, virtues, cultures, throughout, europe, and, asia, minor, saw, the, killing, of, a, boar, as, proof, of, one, s, valor, and, strength, neolithic, hunter, gatherers, depicted, reliefs, of, ferocious, wild, boars, on, their, temple, pillars, at, g, bekli, tepe, some, 11, 600, years, ago, virtually, all, heroes, in, greek, mythology, fight, or, kill, a, boar, at, one, point, the, demigod, herakles, third, labour, involves, the, capture, of, the, erymanthian, boar, theseus, slays, the, wild, sow, phaea, and, a, disguised, odysseus, is, recognised, by, his, handmaiden, eurycleia, by, the, scars, inflicted, on, him, by, a, boar, during, a, hunt, in, his, youth, to, the, mythical, hyperboreans, the, boar, represented, spiritual, authority, several, greek, myths, use, the, boar, as, a, symbol, of, darkness, death, and, winter, one, example, is, the, story, of, the, youthful, adonis, who, is, killed, by, a, boar, and, is, permitted, by, zeus, to, depart, from, hades, only, during, the, spring, and, summer, period, this, theme, also, occurs, in, irish, and, egyptian, mythology, where, the, animal, is, explicitly, linked, to, the, month, of, october, therefore, autumn, this, association, likely, arose, from, aspects, of, the, boar, s, actual, nature, its, dark, colour, was, linked, to, the, night, while, its, solitary, habits, proclivity, to, consume, crops, and, nocturnal, nature, were, associated, with, evil, the, foundation, myth, of, ephesus, has, the, city, being, built, over, the, site, where, prince, androklos, of, athens, killed, a, boar, boars, were, frequently, depicted, on, greek, funerary, monuments, alongside, lions, representing, gallant, losers, who, have, finally, met, their, match, as, opposed, to, victorious, hunters, as, lions, are, the, theme, of, the, doomed, yet, valorous, boar, warrior, also, occurred, in, hittite, culture, where, it, was, traditional, to, sacrifice, a, boar, alongside, a, dog, and, a, prisoner, of, war, after, a, military, defeat, the, boar, as, a, warrior, also, appears, in, germanic, cultures, with, its, image, having, been, frequently, engraved, on, shields, and, swords, they, also, feature, on, germanic, boar, helmets, such, as, the, benty, grange, helmet, where, it, was, believed, to, offer, protection, to, the, wearer, and, has, been, theorised, to, have, been, used, in, spiritual, transformations, into, swine, similar, to, berserkers, the, boar, features, heavily, in, religious, practice, in, germanic, paganism, where, it, is, closely, associated, with, freyr, and, has, also, been, suggested, to, have, been, a, totemic, animal, to, the, swedes, especially, to, the, yngling, royal, dynasty, who, claimed, descent, from, the, god, according, to, tacitus, the, baltic, aesti, featured, boars, on, their, helmets, and, may, have, also, worn, boar, masks, the, boar, and, pig, were, held, in, particularly, high, esteem, by, the, celts, who, considered, them, to, be, their, most, important, sacred, animal, some, celtic, deities, linked, to, boars, include, moccus, and, veteris, it, has, been, suggested, that, some, early, myths, surrounding, the, welsh, hero, culhwch, involved, the, character, being, the, son, of, a, boar, god, nevertheless, the, importance, of, the, boar, as, a, culinary, item, among, celtic, tribes, may, have, been, exaggerated, in, popular, culture, by, the, asterix, series, as, wild, boar, bones, are, rare, among, celtic, archaeological, sites, and, the, few, that, do, occur, show, no, signs, of, butchery, having, probably, been, used, in, sacrificial, rituals, the, boar, also, appears, in, vedic, mythology, and, hindu, mythology, a, story, present, in, the, brahmanas, has, the, god, indra, slaying, an, avaricious, boar, who, has, stolen, the, treasure, of, the, asuras, then, giving, its, carcass, to, the, god, vishnu, who, offered, it, as, a, sacrifice, to, the, gods, in, the, story, s, retelling, in, the, charaka, samhita, the, boar, is, described, as, a, form, of, prajapati, and, is, credited, with, having, raised, the, earth, from, the, primeval, waters, in, the, ramayana, and, the, puranas, the, same, boar, is, portrayed, as, varaha, an, avatar, of, vishnu, in, japanese, culture, the, boar, is, widely, seen, as, a, fearsome, and, reckless, animal, to, the, point, that, several, words, and, expressions, in, japanese, referring, to, recklessness, include, references, to, boars, the, boar, is, the, last, animal, of, the, oriental, zodiac, with, people, born, during, the, year, of, the, pig, being, said, to, embody, the, boar, like, traits, of, determination, and, impetuosity, among, japanese, hunters, the, boar, s, courage, and, defiance, is, a, source, of, admiration, and, it, is, not, uncommon, for, hunters, and, mountain, people, to, name, their, sons, after, the, animal, inoshishi, boars, are, also, seen, as, symbols, of, fertility, and, prosperity, in, some, regions, it, is, thought, that, boars, are, drawn, to, fields, owned, by, families, including, pregnant, women, and, hunters, with, pregnant, wives, are, thought, to, have, greater, chances, of, success, when, boar, hunting, the, animal, s, link, to, prosperity, was, illustrated, by, its, inclusion, on, the, 10, note, during, the, meiji, period, and, it, was, once, believed, that, a, man, could, become, wealthy, by, keeping, a, clump, of, boar, hair, in, his, wallet, in, the, folklore, of, the, mongol, altai, uriankhai, tribe, the, wild, boar, was, associated, with, the, watery, underworld, as, it, was, thought, that, the, spirits, of, the, dead, entered, the, animal, s, head, to, be, ultimately, transported, to, the, water, prior, to, the, conversion, to, islam, the, kyrgyz, people, believed, that, they, were, descended, from, boars, and, thus, did, not, eat, pork, in, buryat, mythology, the, forefathers, of, the, buryats, descended, from, heaven, and, were, nourished, by, a, boar, in, china, the, boar, is, the, emblem, of, the, miao, people, the, boar, sanglier, is, frequently, displayed, in, english, scottish, and, welsh, heraldry, as, with, the, lion, the, boar, is, often, shown, as, armed, and, langued, as, with, the, bear, scottish, and, welsh, heraldry, displays, the, boar, s, head, with, the, neck, cropped, unlike, the, english, version, which, retains, the, neck, the, white, boar, served, as, the, badge, of, king, richard, iii, of, england, who, distributed, it, among, his, northern, retainers, during, his, tenure, as, duke, of, gloucester, humans, have, been, hunting, boar, for, millennia, the, earliest, artistic, depictions, of, such, activities, dating, back, to, the, upper, paleolithic, the, animal, was, seen, as, a, source, of, food, among, the, ancient, greeks, as, well, as, a, sporting, challenge, and, source, of, epic, narratives, the, romans, inherited, this, tradition, with, one, of, its, first, practitioners, being, scipio, aemilianus, boar, hunting, became, particularly, popular, among, the, young, nobility, during, the, 3rd, century, bc, as, preparation, for, manhood, and, battle, a, typical, roman, boar, hunting, tactic, involved, surrounding, a, given, area, with, large, nets, then, flushing, the, boar, with, dogs, and, immobilizing, it, with, smaller, nets, the, animal, would, then, be, dispatched, with, a, venabulum, a, short, spear, with, a, crossguard, at, the, base, of, the, blade, more, than, their, greek, predecessors, the, romans, extensively, took, inspiration, from, boar, hunting, in, their, art, and, sculpture, with, the, ascension, of, constantine, the, great, boar, hunting, took, on, christian, allegorical, themes, with, the, animal, being, portrayed, as, a, black, beast, analogous, to, the, dragon, of, saint, george, boar, hunting, continued, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, though, the, germanic, tribes, considered, the, red, deer, to, be, a, more, noble, and, worthy, quarry, the, post, roman, nobility, hunted, boar, as, their, predecessors, did, but, primarily, as, training, for, battle, rather, than, sport, it, was, not, uncommon, for, medieval, hunters, to, deliberately, hunt, boars, during, the, breeding, season, when, the, animals, were, more, aggressive, during, the, renaissance, when, deforestation, and, the, introduction, of, firearms, reduced, boar, numbers, boar, hunting, became, the, sole, prerogative, of, the, nobility, one, of, many, charges, brought, up, against, the, rich, during, the, german, peasants, war, and, the, french, revolution, during, the, mid, 20th, century, 7, 000, 8, 000, boars, were, caught, in, the, caucasus, 6, 000, 7, 000, in, kazakhstan, and, about, 5, 000, in, central, asia, during, the, soviet, period, primarily, through, the, use, of, dogs, and, beats, in, nepal, farmers, and, poachers, eliminate, boars, by, baiting, balls, of, wheat, flour, containing, explosives, with, kerosene, oil, with, the, animals, chewing, motions, triggering, the, devices, wild, boar, can, thrive, in, captivity, though, piglets, grow, slowly, and, poorly, without, their, mothers, products, derived, from, wild, boar, include, meat, hide, and, bristles, apicius, devotes, a, whole, chapter, to, the, cooking, of, boar, meat, providing, 10, recipes, involving, roasting, boiling, and, what, sauces, to, use, the, romans, usually, served, boar, meat, with, garum, boar, s, head, was, the, centrepiece, of, most, medieval, christmas, celebrations, among, the, nobility, although, growing, in, popularity, as, a, captive, bred, source, of, food, the, wild, boar, takes, longer, to, mature, than, most, domestic, pigs, and, it, is, usually, smaller, and, produces, less, meat, nevertheless, wild, boar, meat, is, leaner, and, healthier, than, pork, being, of, higher, nutritional, value, and, having, a, much, higher, concentration, of, essential, amino, acids, most, meat, dressing, organizations, agree, that, a, boar, carcass, should, yield, 50, kg, 110, lb, of, meat, on, average, large, specimens, can, yield, 15, 20, kg, 33, 44, lb, of, fat, with, some, giants, yielding, 30, kg, 66, lb, or, more, a, boar, hide, can, measure, 3, m, 2, 4, 700, sq, in, and, can, yield, 350, 1, 000, grams, 12, 35, oz, of, bristle, and, 400, grams, 14, oz, of, underwool, boars, can, be, damaging, to, agriculture, in, situations, where, their, natural, habitat, is, sparse, populations, living, on, the, outskirts, of, towns, or, farms, can, dig, up, potatoes, and, damage, melons, watermelons, and, maize, however, they, generally, only, encroach, upon, farms, when, natural, food, is, scarce, in, the, belovezh, forest, for, example, 34, 47, of, the, local, boar, population, will, enter, fields, in, years, of, moderate, availability, of, natural, foods, while, the, role, of, boars, in, damaging, crops, is, often, exaggerated, cases, are, known, of, boar, depredations, causing, famines, as, was, the, case, in, hachinohe, japan, in, 1749, where, 3, 000, people, died, of, what, became, known, as, the, wild, boar, famine, still, within, japanese, culture, the, boar, s, status, as, vermin, is, expressed, through, its, title, as, king, of, pests, and, the, popular, saying, addressed, to, young, men, in, rural, areas, when, you, get, married, choose, a, place, with, no, wild, boar, in, central, europe, farmers, typically, repel, boars, through, distraction, or, fright, while, in, kazakhstan, it, is, usual, to, employ, guard, dogs, in, plantations, however, research, shows, that, when, compared, with, other, mitigation, tactics, hunting, is, the, only, strategy, to, significantly, reduce, crop, damage, by, boars, although, large, boar, populations, can, play, an, important, role, in, limiting, forest, growth, they, are, also, useful, in, keeping, pest, populations, such, as, june, bugs, under, control, the, growth, of, urban, areas, and, the, corresponding, decline, in, natural, boar, habitats, has, led, to, some, sounders, entering, human, habitations, in, search, of, food, as, in, natural, conditions, sounders, in, peri, urban, areas, are, matriarchal, though, males, tend, to, be, much, less, represented, and, adults, of, both, sexes, can, be, up, to, 35, heavier, than, their, forest, dwelling, counterparts, as, of, 2010, at, least, 44, cities, in, 15, countries, have, experienced, problems, of, some, kind, relating, to, the, presence, of, habituated, wild, boar, a, 2023, study, found, that, allowing, wild, pigs, to, forage, on, edible, garbage, in, large, regional, landfills, results, in, those, animals, getting, physically, large, heavier, having, larger, litters, of, piglets, and, causing, more, wild, pig, vehicle, collisions, in, the, vicinity, of, the, landfill, the, effects, of, letting, these, pigs, scavenge, in, these, landfills, can, present, unique, challenges, to, population, management, control, public, safety, and, disease, transmission, wild, pigs, foraging, on, edible, food, waste, in, landfills, has, also, been, identified, as, a, vector, that, facilitates, the, spread, of, african, swine, fever, virus, actual, attacks, on, humans, are, rare, but, can, be, serious, resulting, in, penetrating, injuries, to, the, lower, part, of, the, body, they, generally, occur, during, the, boars, rutting, season, from, november, to, january, in, agricultural, areas, bordering, forests, or, on, paths, leading, through, forests, the, animal, typically, attacks, by, charging, and, pointing, its, tusks, towards, the, intended, victim, with, most, injuries, occurring, on, the, thigh, region, once, the, initial, attack, is, over, the, boar, steps, back, takes, position, and, attacks, again, if, the, victim, is, still, moving, only, ending, once, the, victim, is, completely, incapacitated, boar, attacks, on, humans, have, been, documented, throughout, history, the, romans, and, ancient, greeks, wrote, of, these, attacks, odysseus, was, wounded, by, a, boar, and, adonis, was, killed, by, one, a, 2012, study, compiling, recorded, attacks, from, 1825, to, 2012, found, accounts, of, 665, human, victims, of, both, wild, boars, and, feral, pigs, with, the, majority, 19, of, attacks, in, the, animal, s, native, range, occurring, in, india, most, of, the, attacks, occurred, in, rural, areas, during, the, winter, months, in, non, hunting, contexts, and, were, committed, by, solitary, males, managing, wild, boar, is, a, pressing, task, in, both, native, and, invasive, contexts, as, they, can, be, disruptive, to, other, systems, when, not, addressed, wild, boar, find, their, success, through, adaptation, of, daily, patterns, to, circumvent, threats, they, avoid, human, contact, through, nocturnal, lifestyles, despite, the, fact, that, they, are, not, evolutionarily, predisposed, and, alter, their, diets, substantially, based, on, what, is, available, these, adaptive, generalists, can, survive, in, a, variety, of, landscapes, making, the, prediction, of, their, movement, patterns, and, any, potential, close, contact, areas, crucial, to, limiting, damage, all, of, these, qualities, make, them, equally, difficult, to, manage, or, limit, within, central, europe, the, native, habitat, of, the, wild, boar, there, has, been, a, push, to, re, evaluate, interactions, between, wild, boar, and, humans, with, the, priority, of, fostering, positive, engagement, negative, media, and, public, perception, of, wild, boar, as, crop, raiders, have, made, those, living, alongside, them, less, willing, to, accept, the, economic, damages, of, their, behaviors, as, wild, boar, are, seen, as, pests, this, media, tone, impacts, management, policy, with, every, 10, negative, articles, increasing, wild, boar, policy, activity, by, 6, 7, contrary, to, this, portrayal, wild, boar, when, managed, well, within, their, natural, environments, can, be, a, crucial, part, of, forest, ecosystems, defining, the, limits, of, proper, management, is, difficult, but, the, exclusion, of, wild, boar, from, rare, environments, is, generally, agreed, upon, as, when, not, properly, managed, they, can, damage, agricultural, ventures, and, harm, vulnerable, plant, life, these, damages, are, estimated, at, 800, million, yearly, in, environmental, and, financial, costs, for, the, united, states, alone, the, breadth, of, this, damage, is, due, to, prior, inattention, and, lack, of, management, tactics, for, extended, lengths, of, time, managing, wild, boar, is, a, complex, task, as, it, involves, coordinating, a, combination, of, crop, harvest, techniques, fencing, toxic, bait, corrals, and, hunting, the, most, common, tactic, employed, by, private, land, owners, in, the, united, states, is, recreational, hunting, however, this, is, generally, not, as, effective, on, its, own, management, strategies, are, most, successful, when, they, take, into, account, reproduction, dispersion, and, the, differences, between, ideal, resources, for, males, and, females, according, to, a, study, wild, boars, are, causing, soil, disturbance, that, among, other, problems, globally, results, in, annual, carbon, dioxide, emissions, equivalent, to, that, of, 1, 1, million, passenger, vehicles, 4, 9, mt, 0, 01, of, all, ghg, emissions, as, of, 2022, implying, that, as, of, 2021, hunted, boar, meat, unlike, other, meat, products, has, beneficial, effects, on, the, environment, even, though, the, effect, would, diminish, if, boars, are, introduced, for, meat, production, and, consistently, retaining, small, populations, of, boars, may, be, preferable
