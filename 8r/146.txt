in, botany, a, berry, is, a, fleshy, fruit, without, a, stone, pit, produced, from, a, single, flower, containing, one, ovary, berries, so, defined, include, grapes, currants, and, tomatoes, as, well, as, cucumbers, eggplants, aubergines, persimmons, and, bananas, but, exclude, certain, fruits, that, meet, the, culinary, definition, of, berries, such, as, strawberries, and, raspberries, the, berry, is, the, most, common, type, of, fleshy, fruit, in, which, the, entire, outer, layer, of, the, ovary, wall, ripens, into, a, potentially, edible, pericarp, berries, may, be, formed, from, one, or, more, carpels, from, the, same, flower, i, e, from, a, simple, or, a, compound, ovary, the, seeds, are, usually, embedded, in, the, fleshy, interior, of, the, ovary, but, there, are, some, non, fleshy, exceptions, such, as, capsicum, species, with, air, rather, than, pulp, around, their, seeds, many, berries, are, edible, but, others, such, as, the, fruits, of, the, potato, and, the, deadly, nightshade, are, poisonous, to, humans, a, plant, that, bears, berries, is, said, to, be, bacciferous, or, baccate, from, latin, bacca, in, everyday, english, a, berry, is, any, small, edible, fruit, berries, are, usually, juicy, round, brightly, coloured, sweet, or, sour, and, do, not, have, a, stone, or, pit, although, many, small, seeds, may, be, present, in, botanical, language, a, berry, is, a, simple, fruit, having, seeds, and, fleshy, pulp, the, pericarp, produced, from, the, ovary, of, a, single, flower, the, ovary, can, be, inferior, or, superior, it, is, indehiscent, i, e, it, does, not, have, a, special, line, of, weakness, along, which, it, splits, to, release, the, seeds, when, ripe, the, pericarp, is, divided, into, three, layers, the, outer, layer, is, called, the, exocarp, or, epicarp, the, middle, layer, the, mesocarp, or, sarcocarp, the, inner, layer, the, endocarp, botanists, have, not, applied, these, terms, consistently, exocarp, and, endocarp, may, be, restricted, to, more, or, less, single, layered, skins, or, may, include, tissues, adjacent, to, them, thus, on, one, view, the, exocarp, extends, inwards, to, the, layer, of, vascular, bundles, veins, the, inconsistency, in, usage, has, been, described, as, a, source, of, confusion, the, nature, of, the, endocarp, distinguishes, a, berry, from, a, drupe, which, has, a, hardened, or, stony, endocarp, see, also, below, the, two, kinds, of, fruit, intergrade, depending, on, the, state, of, the, endocarp, some, sources, have, attempted, to, quantify, the, difference, e, g, requiring, the, endocarp, to, be, less, than, 2, mm, thick, in, a, berry, examples, of, botanical, berries, include, true, berries, or, baccae, may, also, be, required, to, have, a, thin, outer, skin, not, self, supporting, when, removed, from, the, berry, this, distinguishes, for, example, a, vaccinium, or, solanum, berry, from, an, adansonia, baobab, amphisarca, which, has, a, dry, more, rigid, and, self, supporting, skin, the, fruit, of, citrus, such, as, the, orange, kumquat, and, lemon, is, a, berry, with, a, thick, rind, and, a, very, juicy, interior, divided, into, segments, by, septa, that, is, given, the, special, name, hesperidium, a, specialized, term, pepo, is, also, used, for, fruits, of, the, gourd, family, cucurbitaceae, which, are, modified, to, have, a, hard, outer, rind, but, are, not, internally, divided, by, septa, the, fruits, of, passiflora, passion, fruit, and, carica, papaya, are, sometimes, also, considered, pepos, berries, that, develop, from, an, inferior, ovary, are, sometimes, termed, epigynous, berries, or, false, berries, as, opposed, to, true, berries, which, develop, from, a, superior, ovary, in, epigynous, berries, the, berry, includes, tissue, derived, from, parts, of, the, flower, other, than, the, ovary, the, floral, tube, formed, from, the, basal, part, of, the, sepals, petals, and, stamens, can, become, fleshy, at, maturity, and, is, united, with, the, ovary, to, form, the, fruit, common, fruits, that, are, sometimes, classified, as, epigynous, berries, include, bananas, coffee, members, of, the, genus, vaccinium, e, g, cranberries, and, blueberries, and, members, of, the, family, cucurbitaceae, gourds, cucumbers, melons, and, squash, many, fruits, which, are, berries, in, the, culinary, definition, are, not, berries, in, the, botanic, sense, but, fall, into, one, of, the, following, categories, drupes, are, varyingly, distinguished, from, botanical, berries, drupes, are, fleshy, fruits, produced, from, a, usually, single, seeded, ovary, with, a, hard, woody, layer, called, the, endocarp, surrounding, the, seed, familiar, examples, include, the, stonefruits, of, the, genus, prunus, peaches, plums, and, cherries, olives, coconut, dates, bayberry, and, persea, species, some, definitions, make, the, mere, presence, of, an, internally, differentiated, endocarp, the, defining, feature, of, a, drupe, others, qualify, the, nature, of, the, endocarp, required, in, a, drupe, e, g, defining, berries, to, have, endocarp, less, than, 2, mm, thick, the, term, drupaceous, is, used, of, fruits, that, have, the, general, structure, and, texture, of, a, drupe, without, necessarily, meeting, the, full, definition, other, drupe, like, fruits, with, a, single, seed, that, lack, the, stony, endocarp, include, sea, buckthorn, hippophae, rhamnoides, elaeagnaceae, which, is, an, achene, surrounded, by, a, swollen, hypanthium, that, provides, the, fleshy, layer, fruits, of, coffea, species, are, described, as, either, drupes, or, berries, the, pome, fruits, produced, by, plants, in, subtribe, pyrinae, of, family, rosaceae, such, as, apples, and, pears, have, a, structure, the, core, in, which, tough, tissue, clearly, separates, the, seeds, from, the, outer, softer, pericarp, although, pomes, are, not, botanical, berries, amelanchier, pomes, become, soft, at, maturity, resembling, a, blueberry, and, are, commonly, called, juneberries, serviceberries, or, saskatoon, berries, aggregate, or, compound, fruits, contain, seeds, from, different, ovaries, of, a, single, flower, with, the, individual, fruitlets, joined, at, maturity, to, form, the, complete, fruit, examples, of, aggregate, fruits, commonly, called, berries, include, members, of, the, genus, rubus, such, as, blackberry, and, raspberry, botanically, these, are, not, berries, other, large, aggregate, fruits, such, as, soursop, annona, muricata, are, not, usually, called, berries, although, some, sources, do, use, this, term, multiple, fruits, are, not, botanical, berries, multiple, fruits, are, the, fruits, of, two, or, more, multiple, flowers, that, are, merged, or, packed, closely, together, the, mulberry, is, a, berry, like, example, of, a, multiple, fruit, it, develops, from, a, cluster, of, tiny, separate, flowers, that, become, compressed, as, they, develop, into, fruit, accessory, fruits, are, not, botanical, berries, in, accessory, fruits, the, edible, part, is, not, generated, by, the, ovary, berry, like, examples, include, the, female, seed, cones, of, some, conifers, have, fleshy, and, merged, scales, giving, them, a, berry, like, appearance, juniper, berries, family, cupressaceae, in, particular, those, of, juniperus, communis, are, used, to, flavour, gin, the, seed, cones, of, species, in, the, families, podocarpaceae, and, taxaceae, have, a, bright, colour, when, fully, developed, increasing, the, resemblance, to, true, berries, the, berries, of, yews, taxus, species, consist, of, a, female, seed, cone, with, which, develops, a, fleshy, red, aril, partially, enclosing, the, poisonous, seed, the, latin, word, baca, or, bacca, plural, baccae, was, originally, used, for, any, small, round, fruit, andrea, caesalpinus, 1519, 1603, classified, plants, into, trees, and, herbs, further, dividing, them, by, properties, of, their, flowers, and, fruit, he, did, not, make, the, modern, distinction, between, fruits, and, seeds, calling, hard, structures, like, nuts, semina, or, seeds, a, fleshy, fruit, was, called, a, pericarpium, for, caesalpinus, a, true, bacca, or, berry, was, a, pericarpium, derived, from, a, flower, with, a, superior, ovary, one, derived, from, a, flower, with, an, inferior, ovary, was, called, a, pomum, in, 1751, carl, linnaeus, wrote, philosophia, botanica, considered, to, be, the, first, textbook, of, descriptive, systematic, botany, he, used, eight, different, terms, for, fruits, one, of, which, was, bacca, or, berry, distinguished, from, other, types, of, fruit, such, as, drupa, drupe, and, pomum, pome, a, bacca, was, defined, as, pericarpium, farctum, evalve, semina, ceteroquin, nuda, continens, meaning, unvalved, solid, pericarp, containing, otherwise, naked, seeds, the, adjective, farctus, here, has, the, sense, of, solid, with, tissue, softer, than, the, outside, stuffed, a, berry, or, bacca, was, distinguished, from, a, drupe, and, a, pome, both, of, which, also, had, an, unvalved, solid, pericarp, a, drupe, also, contained, a, nut, nux, and, a, pome, a, capsule, capsula, rather, than, the, berry, s, naked, seeds, linnaeus, use, of, bacca, and, pomum, was, thus, significantly, different, from, that, of, caesalpinus, botanists, continue, to, differ, on, how, fruit, should, be, classified, joseph, gaertner, published, a, two, volume, work, de, fructibus, et, seminibus, plantarum, on, the, fruits, and, seeds, of, plants, between, 1788, and, 1792, in, addition, to, linnaeus, eight, terms, he, introduced, seven, more, including, pepo, for, the, berry, like, fruits, of, cucurbits, a, pepo, was, distinguished, by, being, a, fleshy, berry, with, the, seeds, distant, from, the, axis, and, so, nearer, the, fruit, wall, i, e, by, having, parietal, placentation, in, modern, terminology, nicaise, auguste, desvaux, in, 1813, used, the, terms, hesperidium, and, amphisarca, as, further, subdivisions, of, berries, a, hesperidium, called, by, others, bacca, corticata, berry, with, a, cortex, had, separate, internal, compartments, loges, in, the, original, french, and, a, separable, membraneous, epicarp, or, skin, an, amphisarca, was, described, as, woody, on, the, outside, and, fleshy, on, the, inside, hesperidium, remains, in, general, use, but, amphisarca, is, rarely, used, there, remains, no, universally, agreed, system, of, classification, for, fruits, and, there, continues, to, be, confusion, over, classification, of, fruit, types, and, the, definitions, given, to, fruit, terms, by, definition, berries, have, a, fleshy, indehiscent, pericarp, as, opposed, to, a, dry, dehiscent, pericarp, fossils, show, that, early, flowering, plants, had, dry, fruits, fleshy, fruits, such, as, berries, or, drupes, appeared, only, towards, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, or, the, beginning, of, the, paleogene, period, about, 66, million, years, ago, the, increasing, importance, of, seed, dispersal, by, fruit, eating, vertebrates, both, mammals, and, birds, may, have, driven, the, evolution, of, fleshy, fruits, alternatively, the, causal, direction, may, be, the, other, way, round, large, fleshy, fruits, are, associated, with, moist, habitats, with, closed, tree, canopies, where, wind, dispersal, of, dry, fruits, is, less, effective, such, habitats, were, increasingly, common, in, the, paleogene, and, the, associated, change, in, fruit, type, may, have, led, to, the, evolution, of, fruit, eating, in, mammals, and, birds, fruit, type, has, been, considered, to, be, a, useful, character, in, classification, and, in, understanding, the, phylogeny, of, plants, the, evolution, of, fruits, with, a, berry, like, pericarp, has, been, studied, in, a, wide, range, of, flowering, plant, families, repeated, transitions, between, fleshy, and, dry, pericarps, have, been, demonstrated, regularly, one, well, studied, family, is, the, solanaceae, because, of, the, commercial, importance, of, fruit, such, as, tomatoes, bell, peppers, and, eggplants, or, aubergines, capsules, which, are, dry, dehiscent, fruits, appear, to, be, the, original, form, of, the, fruit, in, the, earliest, diverging, members, of, the, family, berries, have, then, evolved, at, least, three, times, in, cestrum, duboisia, and, in, the, subfamily, solanoideae, detailed, anatomical, and, developmental, studies, have, shown, that, the, berries, of, cestrum, and, those, of, the, solanoideae, are, significantly, different, for, example, expansion, of, the, fruit, during, development, involves, cell, divisions, in, the, mesocarp, in, solanoideae, berries, but, not, in, cestrum, berries, when, fruits, described, as, berries, were, studied, in, the, family, melastomaceae, they, were, found, to, be, highly, variable, in, structure, some, being, soft, with, an, endocarp, that, soon, broke, down, others, having, a, hard, persistent, endocarp, even, woody, in, some, species, fruits, classified, as, berries, are, thus, not, necessarily, homologous, with, the, fleshy, part, being, derived, from, different, parts, of, the, ovary, and, with, other, structural, and, developmental, differences, the, presence, or, absence, of, berries, is, not, a, reliable, guide, to, phylogeny, indeed, fruit, type, in, general, has, proved, to, be, an, unreliable, guide, to, flowering, plant, relationships, berries, defined, loosely, have, been, valuable, as, a, food, source, to, humans, since, before, the, start, of, agriculture, and, remain, among, the, primary, food, sources, of, other, primates, botanically, defined, berries, with, culinary, uses, include, some, berries, are, brightly, coloured, due, to, plant, pigments, such, as, anthocyanins, and, other, flavonoids, these, pigments, are, localized, mainly, in, the, outer, surface, and, the, seeds, such, pigments, have, antioxidant, properties, in, vitro, but, there, is, no, reliable, evidence, that, they, have, antioxidant, or, any, other, useful, functions, within, the, human, body, consequently, it, is, not, permitted, to, claim, that, foods, containing, plant, pigments, have, antioxidant, health, value, on, product, labels, in, the, united, states, or, europe, some, spices, are, prepared, from, berries, allspice, is, made, from, the, dried, berries, of, pimenta, dioica, the, fruits, berries, of, different, cultivars, of, capsicum, annuum, are, used, to, make, paprika, mildly, hot, chili, pepper, hot, and, cayenne, pepper, very, hot, pepos, characterized, by, a, hard, outer, rind, have, also, been, used, as, containers, by, removing, the, inner, flesh, and, seeds, and, then, drying, the, remaining, exocarp, the, english, name, of, lagenaria, siceraria, bottle, gourd, reflects, its, use, as, a, liquid, container, some, true, berries, have, also, been, used, as, a, source, of, dyes, in, hawaii, these, included, berries, from, a, species, of, dianella, used, to, produce, blue, and, berries, from, black, nightshade, solanum, americanum, used, to, produce, green, cucurbit, berries, or, pepos, particularly, from, cucurbita, and, lagenaria, are, the, earliest, plants, known, to, be, domesticated, before, 9, 000, 10, 000, bp, in, the, americas, and, probably, by, 12, 000, 13, 000, bp, in, asia, peppers, were, domesticated, in, mesoamerica, by, 8, 000, bp, many, other, early, cultivated, plants, were, also, berries, by, the, strict, botanical, definition, including, grapes, domesticated, by, 8, 000, bp, and, known, to, have, been, used, in, wine, production, by, 6, 000, bp, bananas, were, first, domesticated, in, papua, new, guinea, and, southeast, asia, archaeological, and, palaeoenvironmental, evidence, at, kuk, swamp, in, the, western, highlands, province, of, papua, new, guinea, suggests, that, banana, cultivation, there, goes, back, to, at, least, 7, 000, bp, and, possibly, to, 10, 000, bp, the, history, of, cultivated, citrus, fruit, remains, unclear, although, some, recent, research, suggests, a, possible, origin, in, papuasia, rather, than, continental, southeast, asia, chinese, documents, show, that, mandarins, and, pomelos, were, established, in, cultivation, there, by, around, 4, 200, bp, according, to, faostat, data, in, 2013, four, of, the, five, top, fruit, crops, in, terms, of, world, production, by, weight, were, botanical, berries, the, other, was, a, pome, apples, citrus, fruit, includes, but, is, not, limited, to, oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit, including, pomelos, tangerines, mandarins, clementines, and, satsumas, oranges, make, up, 53, of, the, total, according, to, faostat, in, 2001, bananas, including, plantains, and, citrus, comprised, over, 25, by, value, of, the, world, s, exported, fruits, and, vegetables, citrus, fruits, being, more, valuable, than, bananas, export, quantities, of, fruit, are, not, entirely, comparable, with, production, quantities, since, slightly, different, categories, are, used, the, top, five, fruit, exports, by, weight, in, 2012, are, shown, in, the, table, below, the, top, two, places, are, again, occupied, by, bananas, and, citrus, citrus, fruit, includes, oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit, including, pomelos, tangerines, mandarins, clementines, and, satsumas, oranges, make, up, 43, of, the, total, prepared, fruit, here, is, fruit, nuts, and, peel, including, frozen, prepared, or, preserved, jam, paste, marmalade, pur, e, and, cooked, fruits, other, than, those, listed, separately
