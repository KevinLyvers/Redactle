transcription, is, the, process, of, copying, a, segment, of, dna, into, rna, the, segments, of, dna, transcribed, into, rna, molecules, that, can, encode, proteins, produce, messenger, rna, mrna, other, segments, of, dna, are, transcribed, into, rna, molecules, called, non, coding, rnas, ncrnas, both, dna, and, rna, are, nucleic, acids, which, use, base, pairs, of, nucleotides, as, a, complementary, language, during, transcription, a, dna, sequence, is, read, by, an, rna, polymerase, which, produces, a, complementary, antiparallel, rna, strand, called, a, primary, transcript, in, virology, the, term, transcription, is, used, when, referring, to, mrna, synthesis, from, a, viral, rna, molecule, the, genome, of, many, rna, viruses, is, composed, of, negative, sense, rna, which, acts, as, a, template, for, positive, sense, viral, messenger, rna, a, necessary, step, in, the, synthesis, of, viral, proteins, needed, for, viral, replication, this, process, is, catalyzed, by, a, viral, rna, dependent, rna, polymerase, a, dna, transcription, unit, encoding, for, a, protein, may, contain, both, a, coding, sequence, which, will, be, translated, into, the, protein, and, regulatory, sequences, which, direct, and, regulate, the, synthesis, of, that, protein, the, regulatory, sequence, before, upstream, from, the, coding, sequence, is, called, the, five, prime, untranslated, regions, 5, utr, the, sequence, after, downstream, from, the, coding, sequence, is, called, the, three, prime, untranslated, regions, 3, utr, as, opposed, to, dna, replication, transcription, results, in, an, rna, complement, that, includes, the, nucleotide, uracil, u, in, all, instances, where, thymine, t, would, have, occurred, in, a, dna, complement, only, one, of, the, two, dna, strands, serves, as, a, template, for, transcription, the, antisense, strand, of, dna, is, read, by, rna, polymerase, from, the, 3, end, to, the, 5, end, during, transcription, 3, 5, the, complementary, rna, is, created, in, the, opposite, direction, in, the, 5, 3, direction, matching, the, sequence, of, the, sense, strand, except, switching, uracil, for, thymine, this, directionality, is, because, rna, polymerase, can, only, add, nucleotides, to, the, 3, end, of, the, growing, mrna, chain, this, use, of, only, the, 3, 5, dna, strand, eliminates, the, need, for, the, okazaki, fragments, that, are, seen, in, dna, replication, this, also, removes, the, need, for, an, rna, primer, to, initiate, rna, synthesis, as, is, the, case, in, dna, replication, the, non, template, sense, strand, of, dna, is, called, the, coding, strand, because, its, sequence, is, the, same, as, the, newly, created, rna, transcript, except, for, the, substitution, of, uracil, for, thymine, this, is, the, strand, that, is, used, by, convention, when, presenting, a, dna, sequence, transcription, has, some, proofreading, mechanisms, but, they, are, fewer, and, less, effective, than, the, controls, for, copying, dna, as, a, result, transcription, has, a, lower, copying, fidelity, than, dna, replication, transcription, is, divided, into, initiation, promoter, escape, elongation, and, termination, setting, up, for, transcription, in, mammals, is, regulated, by, many, cis, regulatory, elements, including, core, promoter, and, promoter, proximal, elements, that, are, located, near, the, transcription, start, sites, of, genes, core, promoters, combined, with, general, transcription, factors, are, sufficient, to, direct, transcription, initiation, but, generally, have, low, basal, activity, other, important, cis, regulatory, modules, are, localized, in, dna, regions, that, are, distant, from, the, transcription, start, sites, these, include, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and, tethering, elements, among, this, constellation, of, elements, enhancers, and, their, associated, transcription, factors, have, a, leading, role, in, the, initiation, of, gene, transcription, an, enhancer, localized, in, a, dna, region, distant, from, the, promoter, of, a, gene, can, have, a, very, large, effect, on, gene, transcription, with, some, genes, undergoing, up, to, 100, fold, increased, transcription, due, to, an, activated, enhancer, enhancers, are, regions, of, the, genome, that, are, major, gene, regulatory, elements, enhancers, control, cell, type, specific, gene, transcription, programs, most, often, by, looping, through, long, distances, to, come, in, physical, proximity, with, the, promoters, of, their, target, genes, while, there, are, hundreds, of, thousands, of, enhancer, dna, regions, for, a, particular, type, of, tissue, only, specific, enhancers, are, brought, into, proximity, with, the, promoters, that, they, regulate, in, a, study, of, brain, cortical, neurons, 24, 937, loops, were, found, bringing, enhancers, to, their, target, promoters, multiple, enhancers, each, often, at, tens, or, hundred, of, thousands, of, nucleotides, distant, from, their, target, genes, loop, to, their, target, gene, promoters, and, can, coordinate, with, each, other, to, control, transcription, of, their, common, target, gene, the, schematic, illustration, in, this, section, shows, an, enhancer, looping, around, to, come, into, close, physical, proximity, with, the, promoter, of, a, target, gene, the, loop, is, stabilized, by, a, dimer, of, a, connector, protein, e, g, dimer, of, ctcf, or, yy1, with, one, member, of, the, dimer, anchored, to, its, binding, motif, on, the, enhancer, and, the, other, member, anchored, to, its, binding, motif, on, the, promoter, represented, by, the, red, zigzags, in, the, illustration, several, cell, function, specific, transcription, factors, there, are, about, 1, 600, transcription, factors, in, a, human, cell, generally, bind, to, specific, motifs, on, an, enhancer, and, a, small, combination, of, these, enhancer, bound, transcription, factors, when, brought, close, to, a, promoter, by, a, dna, loop, govern, level, of, transcription, of, the, target, gene, mediator, a, complex, usually, consisting, of, about, 26, proteins, in, an, interacting, structure, communicates, regulatory, signals, from, enhancer, dna, bound, transcription, factors, directly, to, the, rna, polymerase, ii, pol, ii, enzyme, bound, to, the, promoter, enhancers, when, active, are, generally, transcribed, from, both, strands, of, dna, with, rna, polymerases, acting, in, two, different, directions, producing, two, enhancer, rnas, ernas, as, illustrated, in, the, figure, an, inactive, enhancer, may, be, bound, by, an, inactive, transcription, factor, phosphorylation, of, the, transcription, factor, may, activate, it, and, that, activated, transcription, factor, may, then, activate, the, enhancer, to, which, it, is, bound, see, small, red, star, representing, phosphorylation, of, transcription, factor, bound, to, enhancer, in, the, illustration, an, activated, enhancer, begins, transcription, of, its, rna, before, activating, transcription, of, messenger, rna, from, its, target, gene, transcription, regulation, at, about, 60, of, promoters, is, also, controlled, by, methylation, of, cytosines, within, cpg, dinucleotides, where, 5, cytosine, is, followed, by, 3, guanine, or, cpg, sites, 5, methylcytosine, 5, mc, is, a, methylated, form, of, the, dna, base, cytosine, see, figure, 5, mc, is, an, epigenetic, marker, found, predominantly, within, cpg, sites, about, 28, million, cpg, dinucleotides, occur, in, the, human, genome, in, most, tissues, of, mammals, on, average, 70, to, 80, of, cpg, cytosines, are, methylated, forming, 5, methylcpg, or, 5, mcpg, however, unmethylated, cytosines, within, 5, cytosine, guanine, 3, sequences, often, occur, in, groups, called, cpg, islands, at, active, promoters, about, 60, of, promoter, sequences, have, a, cpg, island, while, only, about, 6, of, enhancer, sequences, have, a, cpg, island, cpg, islands, constitute, regulatory, sequences, since, if, cpg, islands, are, methylated, in, the, promoter, of, a, gene, this, can, reduce, or, silence, gene, transcription, dna, methylation, regulates, gene, transcription, through, interaction, with, methyl, binding, domain, mbd, proteins, such, as, mecp2, mbd1, and, mbd2, these, mbd, proteins, bind, most, strongly, to, highly, methylated, cpg, islands, these, mbd, proteins, have, both, a, methyl, cpg, binding, domain, as, well, as, a, transcription, repression, domain, they, bind, to, methylated, dna, and, guide, or, direct, protein, complexes, with, chromatin, remodeling, and, or, histone, modifying, activity, to, methylated, cpg, islands, mbd, proteins, generally, repress, local, chromatin, such, as, by, catalyzing, the, introduction, of, repressive, histone, marks, or, creating, an, overall, repressive, chromatin, environment, through, nucleosome, remodeling, and, chromatin, reorganization, as, noted, in, the, previous, section, transcription, factors, are, proteins, that, bind, to, specific, dna, sequences, in, order, to, regulate, the, expression, of, a, gene, the, binding, sequence, for, a, transcription, factor, in, dna, is, usually, about, 10, or, 11, nucleotides, long, as, summarized, in, 2009, vaquerizas, et, al, indicated, there, are, approximately, 1, 400, different, transcription, factors, encoded, in, the, human, genome, by, genes, that, constitute, about, 6, of, all, human, protein, encoding, genes, about, 94, of, transcription, factor, binding, sites, tfbss, that, are, associated, with, signal, responsive, genes, occur, in, enhancers, while, only, about, 6, of, such, tfbss, occur, in, promoters, egr1, protein, is, a, particular, transcription, factor, that, is, important, for, regulation, of, methylation, of, cpg, islands, an, egr1, transcription, factor, binding, site, is, frequently, located, in, enhancer, or, promoter, sequences, there, are, about, 12, 000, binding, sites, for, egr1, in, the, mammalian, genome, and, about, half, of, egr1, binding, sites, are, located, in, promoters, and, half, in, enhancers, the, binding, of, egr1, to, its, target, dna, binding, site, is, insensitive, to, cytosine, methylation, in, the, dna, while, only, small, amounts, of, egr1, transcription, factor, protein, are, detectable, in, cells, that, are, un, stimulated, translation, of, the, egr1, gene, into, protein, at, one, hour, after, stimulation, is, drastically, elevated, production, of, egr1, transcription, factor, proteins, in, various, types, of, cells, can, be, stimulated, by, growth, factors, neurotransmitters, hormones, stress, and, injury, in, the, brain, when, neurons, are, activated, egr1, proteins, are, up, regulated, and, they, bind, to, recruit, the, pre, existing, tet1, enzymes, that, are, produced, in, high, amounts, in, neurons, tet, enzymes, can, catalyse, demethylation, of, 5, methylcytosine, when, egr1, transcription, factors, bring, tet1, enzymes, to, egr1, binding, sites, in, promoters, the, tet, enzymes, can, demethylate, the, methylated, cpg, islands, at, those, promoters, upon, demethylation, these, promoters, can, then, initiate, transcription, of, their, target, genes, hundreds, of, genes, in, neurons, are, differentially, expressed, after, neuron, activation, through, egr1, recruitment, of, tet1, to, methylated, regulatory, sequences, in, their, promoters, the, methylation, of, promoters, is, also, altered, in, response, to, signals, the, three, mammalian, dna, methyltransferasess, dnmt1, dnmt3a, and, dnmt3b, catalyze, the, addition, of, methyl, groups, to, cytosines, in, dna, while, dnmt1, is, a, maintenance, methyltransferase, dnmt3a, and, dnmt3b, can, carry, out, new, methylations, there, are, also, two, splice, protein, isoforms, produced, from, the, dnmt3a, gene, dna, methyltransferase, proteins, dnmt3a1, and, dnmt3a2, the, splice, isoform, dnmt3a2, behaves, like, the, product, of, a, classical, immediate, early, gene, and, for, instance, it, is, robustly, and, transiently, produced, after, neuronal, activation, where, the, dna, methyltransferase, isoform, dnmt3a2, binds, and, adds, methyl, groups, to, cytosines, appears, to, be, determined, by, histone, post, translational, modifications, on, the, other, hand, neural, activation, causes, degradation, of, dnmt3a1, accompanied, by, reduced, methylation, of, at, least, one, evaluated, targeted, promoter, transcription, begins, with, the, rna, polymerase, and, one, or, more, general, transcription, factors, binding, to, a, dna, promoter, sequence, to, form, an, rna, polymerase, promoter, closed, complex, in, the, closed, complex, the, promoter, dna, is, still, fully, double, stranded, rna, polymerase, assisted, by, one, or, more, general, transcription, factors, then, unwinds, approximately, 14, base, pairs, of, dna, to, form, an, rna, polymerase, promoter, open, complex, in, the, open, complex, the, promoter, dna, is, partly, unwound, and, single, stranded, the, exposed, single, stranded, dna, is, referred, to, as, the, transcription, bubble, rna, polymerase, assisted, by, one, or, more, general, transcription, factors, then, selects, a, transcription, start, site, in, the, transcription, bubble, binds, to, an, initiating, ntp, and, an, extending, ntp, or, a, short, rna, primer, and, an, extending, ntp, complementary, to, the, transcription, start, site, sequence, and, catalyzes, bond, formation, to, yield, an, initial, rna, product, in, bacteria, rna, polymerase, holoenzyme, consists, of, five, subunits, 2, subunits, 1, subunit, 1, subunit, and, 1, subunit, in, bacteria, there, is, one, general, rna, transcription, factor, known, as, a, sigma, factor, rna, polymerase, core, enzyme, binds, to, the, bacterial, general, transcription, sigma, factor, to, form, rna, polymerase, holoenzyme, and, then, binds, to, a, promoter, rna, polymerase, is, called, a, holoenzyme, when, sigma, subunit, is, attached, to, the, core, enzyme, which, is, consist, of, 2, subunits, 1, subunit, 1, subunit, only, unlike, eukaryotes, the, initiating, nucleotide, of, nascent, bacterial, mrna, is, not, capped, with, a, modified, guanine, nucleotide, the, initiating, nucleotide, of, bacterial, transcripts, bears, a, 5, triphosphate, 5, ppp, which, can, be, used, for, genome, wide, mapping, of, transcription, initiation, sites, in, archaea, and, eukaryotes, rna, polymerase, contains, subunits, homologous, to, each, of, the, five, rna, polymerase, subunits, in, bacteria, and, also, contains, additional, subunits, in, archaea, and, eukaryotes, the, functions, of, the, bacterial, general, transcription, factor, sigma, are, performed, by, multiple, general, transcription, factors, that, work, together, in, archaea, there, are, three, general, transcription, factors, tbp, tfb, and, tfe, in, eukaryotes, in, rna, polymerase, ii, dependent, transcription, there, are, six, general, transcription, factors, tfiia, tfiib, an, ortholog, of, archaeal, tfb, tfiid, a, multisubunit, factor, in, which, the, key, subunit, tbp, is, an, ortholog, of, archaeal, tbp, tfiie, an, ortholog, of, archaeal, tfe, tfiif, and, tfiih, the, tfiid, is, the, first, component, to, bind, to, dna, due, to, binding, of, tbp, while, tfiih, is, the, last, component, to, be, recruited, in, archaea, and, eukaryotes, the, rna, polymerase, promoter, closed, complex, is, usually, referred, to, as, the, preinitiation, complex, transcription, initiation, is, regulated, by, additional, proteins, known, as, activators, and, repressors, and, in, some, cases, associated, coactivators, or, corepressors, which, modulate, formation, and, function, of, the, transcription, initiation, complex, after, the, first, bond, is, synthesized, the, rna, polymerase, must, escape, the, promoter, during, this, time, there, is, a, tendency, to, release, the, rna, transcript, and, produce, truncated, transcripts, this, is, called, abortive, initiation, and, is, common, for, both, eukaryotes, and, prokaryotes, abortive, initiation, continues, to, occur, until, an, rna, product, of, a, threshold, length, of, approximately, 10, nucleotides, is, synthesized, at, which, point, promoter, escape, occurs, and, a, transcription, elongation, complex, is, formed, mechanistically, promoter, escape, occurs, through, dna, scrunching, providing, the, energy, needed, to, break, interactions, between, rna, polymerase, holoenzyme, and, the, promoter, in, bacteria, it, was, historically, thought, that, the, sigma, factor, is, definitely, released, after, promoter, clearance, occurs, this, theory, had, been, known, as, the, obligate, release, model, however, later, data, showed, that, upon, and, following, promoter, clearance, the, sigma, factor, is, released, according, to, a, stochastic, model, known, as, the, stochastic, release, model, in, eukaryotes, at, an, rna, polymerase, ii, dependent, promoter, upon, promoter, clearance, tfiih, phosphorylates, serine, 5, on, the, carboxy, terminal, domain, of, rna, polymerase, ii, leading, to, the, recruitment, of, capping, enzyme, ce, the, exact, mechanism, of, how, ce, induces, promoter, clearance, in, eukaryotes, is, not, yet, known, one, strand, of, the, dna, the, template, strand, or, noncoding, strand, is, used, as, a, template, for, rna, synthesis, as, transcription, proceeds, rna, polymerase, traverses, the, template, strand, and, uses, base, pairing, complementarity, with, the, dna, template, to, create, an, rna, copy, which, elongates, during, the, traversal, although, rna, polymerase, traverses, the, template, strand, from, 3, 5, the, coding, non, template, strand, and, newly, formed, rna, can, also, be, used, as, reference, points, so, transcription, can, be, described, as, occurring, 5, 3, this, produces, an, rna, molecule, from, 5, 3, an, exact, copy, of, the, coding, strand, except, that, thymines, are, replaced, with, uracils, and, the, nucleotides, are, composed, of, a, ribose, 5, carbon, sugar, whereas, dna, has, deoxyribose, one, fewer, oxygen, atom, in, its, sugar, phosphate, backbone, mrna, transcription, can, involve, multiple, rna, polymerases, on, a, single, dna, template, and, multiple, rounds, of, transcription, amplification, of, particular, mrna, so, many, mrna, molecules, can, be, rapidly, produced, from, a, single, copy, of, a, gene, the, characteristic, elongation, rates, in, prokaryotes, and, eukaryotes, are, about, 10, 100, nts, sec, in, eukaryotes, however, nucleosomes, act, as, major, barriers, to, transcribing, polymerases, during, transcription, elongation, in, these, organisms, the, pausing, induced, by, nucleosomes, can, be, regulated, by, transcription, elongation, factors, such, as, tfiis, elongation, also, involves, a, proofreading, mechanism, that, can, replace, incorrectly, incorporated, bases, in, eukaryotes, this, may, correspond, with, short, pauses, during, transcription, that, allow, appropriate, rna, editing, factors, to, bind, these, pauses, may, be, intrinsic, to, the, rna, polymerase, or, due, to, chromatin, structure, double, strand, breaks, in, actively, transcribed, regions, of, dna, are, repaired, by, homologous, recombination, during, the, s, and, g2, phases, of, the, cell, cycle, since, transcription, enhances, the, accessibility, of, dna, to, exogenous, chemicals, and, internal, metabolites, that, can, cause, recombinogenic, lesions, homologous, recombination, of, a, particular, dna, sequence, may, be, strongly, stimulated, by, transcription, bacteria, use, two, different, strategies, for, transcription, termination, rho, independent, termination, and, rho, dependent, termination, in, rho, independent, transcription, termination, rna, transcription, stops, when, the, newly, synthesized, rna, molecule, forms, a, g, c, rich, hairpin, loop, followed, by, a, run, of, us, when, the, hairpin, forms, the, mechanical, stress, breaks, the, weak, ru, da, bonds, now, filling, the, dna, rna, hybrid, this, pulls, the, poly, u, transcript, out, of, the, active, site, of, the, rna, polymerase, terminating, transcription, in, rho, dependent, termination, rho, a, protein, factor, destabilizes, the, interaction, between, the, template, and, the, mrna, thus, releasing, the, newly, synthesized, mrna, from, the, elongation, complex, transcription, termination, in, eukaryotes, is, less, well, understood, than, in, bacteria, but, involves, cleavage, of, the, new, transcript, followed, by, template, independent, addition, of, adenines, at, its, new, 3, end, in, a, process, called, polyadenylation, beyond, termination, by, a, terminator, sequences, which, is, a, part, of, a, gene, transcription, may, also, need, to, be, terminated, when, it, encounters, conditions, such, as, dna, damage, or, an, active, replication, fork, in, bacteria, the, mfd, atpase, can, remove, a, rna, polymerase, stalled, at, a, lesion, by, prying, open, its, clamp, it, also, recruits, nucleotide, excision, repair, machinery, to, repair, the, lesion, mfd, is, proposed, to, also, resolve, conflicts, between, dna, replication, and, transcription, in, eukayrotes, atpase, ttf2, helps, to, suppress, the, action, of, rnap, i, and, ii, during, mitosis, preventing, errors, in, chromosomal, segregation, in, archaea, the, eta, atpase, is, proposed, to, play, a, similar, role, rna, polymerase, plays, a, very, crucial, role, in, all, steps, including, post, transcriptional, changes, in, rna, as, shown, in, the, image, in, the, right, it, is, evident, that, the, ctd, c, terminal, domain, is, a, tail, that, changes, its, shape, this, tail, will, be, used, as, a, carrier, of, splicing, capping, and, polyadenylation, as, shown, in, the, image, on, the, left, transcription, inhibitors, can, be, used, as, antibiotics, against, for, example, pathogenic, bacteria, antibacterials, and, fungi, antifungals, an, example, of, such, an, antibacterial, is, rifampicin, which, inhibits, bacterial, transcription, of, dna, into, mrna, by, inhibiting, dna, dependent, rna, polymerase, by, binding, its, beta, subunit, while, 8, hydroxyquinoline, is, an, antifungal, transcription, inhibitor, the, effects, of, histone, methylation, may, also, work, to, inhibit, the, action, of, transcription, potent, bioactive, natural, products, like, triptolide, that, inhibit, mammalian, transcription, via, inhibition, of, the, xpb, subunit, of, the, general, transcription, factor, tfiih, has, been, recently, reported, as, a, glucose, conjugate, for, targeting, hypoxic, cancer, cells, with, increased, glucose, transporter, production, in, vertebrates, the, majority, of, gene, promoters, contain, a, cpg, island, with, numerous, cpg, sites, when, many, of, a, gene, s, promoter, cpg, sites, are, methylated, the, gene, becomes, inhibited, silenced, colorectal, cancers, typically, have, 3, to, 6, driver, mutations, and, 33, to, 66, hitchhiker, or, passenger, mutations, however, transcriptional, inhibition, silencing, may, be, of, more, importance, than, mutation, in, causing, progression, to, cancer, for, example, in, colorectal, cancers, about, 600, to, 800, genes, are, transcriptionally, inhibited, by, cpg, island, methylation, see, regulation, of, transcription, in, cancer, transcriptional, repression, in, cancer, can, also, occur, by, other, epigenetic, mechanisms, such, as, altered, production, of, micrornas, in, breast, cancer, transcriptional, repression, of, brca1, may, occur, more, frequently, by, over, produced, microrna, 182, than, by, hypermethylation, of, the, brca1, promoter, see, low, expression, of, brca1, in, breast, and, ovarian, cancers, active, transcription, units, are, clustered, in, the, nucleus, in, discrete, sites, called, transcription, factories, or, euchromatin, such, sites, can, be, visualized, by, allowing, engaged, polymerases, to, extend, their, transcripts, in, tagged, precursors, br, utp, or, br, u, and, immuno, labeling, the, tagged, nascent, rna, transcription, factories, can, also, be, localized, using, fluorescence, in, situ, hybridization, or, marked, by, antibodies, directed, against, polymerases, there, are, 10, 000, factories, in, the, nucleoplasm, of, a, hela, cell, among, which, are, 8, 000, polymerase, ii, factories, and, 2, 000, polymerase, iii, factories, each, polymerase, ii, factory, contains, 8, polymerases, as, most, active, transcription, units, are, associated, with, only, one, polymerase, each, factory, usually, contains, 8, different, transcription, units, these, units, might, be, associated, through, promoters, and, or, enhancers, with, loops, forming, a, cloud, around, the, factor, a, molecule, that, allows, the, genetic, material, to, be, realized, as, a, protein, was, first, hypothesized, by, fran, ois, jacob, and, jacques, monod, severo, ochoa, won, a, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1959, for, developing, a, process, for, synthesizing, rna, in, vitro, with, polynucleotide, phosphorylase, which, was, useful, for, cracking, the, genetic, code, rna, synthesis, by, rna, polymerase, was, established, in, vitro, by, several, laboratories, by, 1965, however, the, rna, synthesized, by, these, enzymes, had, properties, that, suggested, the, existence, of, an, additional, factor, needed, to, terminate, transcription, correctly, roger, d, kornberg, won, the, 2006, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, studies, of, the, molecular, basis, of, eukaryotic, transcription, transcription, can, be, measured, and, detected, in, a, variety, of, ways, some, viruses, such, as, hiv, the, cause, of, aids, have, the, ability, to, transcribe, rna, into, dna, hiv, has, an, rna, genome, that, is, reverse, transcribed, into, dna, the, resulting, dna, can, be, merged, with, the, dna, genome, of, the, host, cell, the, main, enzyme, responsible, for, synthesis, of, dna, from, an, rna, template, is, called, reverse, transcriptase, in, the, case, of, hiv, reverse, transcriptase, is, responsible, for, synthesizing, a, complementary, dna, strand, cdna, to, the, viral, rna, genome, the, enzyme, ribonuclease, h, then, digests, the, rna, strand, and, reverse, transcriptase, synthesises, a, complementary, strand, of, dna, to, form, a, double, helix, dna, structure, cdna, the, cdna, is, integrated, into, the, host, cell, s, genome, by, the, enzyme, integrase, which, causes, the, host, cell, to, generate, viral, proteins, that, reassemble, into, new, viral, particles, in, hiv, subsequent, to, this, the, host, cell, undergoes, programmed, cell, death, or, apoptosis, of, t, cells, however, in, other, retroviruses, the, host, cell, remains, intact, as, the, virus, buds, out, of, the, cell, some, eukaryotic, cells, contain, an, enzyme, with, reverse, transcription, activity, called, telomerase, telomerase, carries, an, rna, template, from, which, it, synthesizes, a, telomere, a, repeating, sequence, of, dna, to, the, end, of, linear, chromosomes, it, is, important, because, every, time, a, linear, chromosome, is, duplicated, it, is, shortened, with, the, telomere, at, the, ends, of, chromosomes, the, shortening, eliminates, some, of, the, non, essential, repeated, sequence, rather, than, the, protein, encoding, dna, sequence, farther, away, from, the, chromosome, end, telomerase, is, often, activated, in, cancer, cells, to, enable, cancer, cells, to, duplicate, their, genomes, indefinitely, without, losing, important, protein, coding, dna, sequence, activation, of, telomerase, could, be, part, of, the, process, that, allows, cancer, cells, to, become, immortal, the, immortalizing, factor, of, cancer, via, telomere, lengthening, due, to, telomerase, has, been, proven, to, occur, in, 90, of, all, carcinogenic, tumors, in, vivo, with, the, remaining, 10, using, an, alternative, telomere, maintenance, route, called, alt, or, alternative, lengthening, of, telomeres
