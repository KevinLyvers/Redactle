see, text, amaranthus, is, a, cosmopolitan, group, of, more, than, 50, species, which, make, up, the, genus, of, annual, or, short, lived, perennial, plants, collectively, known, as, amaranths, some, of, the, more, well, known, names, include, prostrate, pigweed, and, love, lies, bleeding, some, amaranth, species, are, cultivated, as, leaf, vegetables, pseudocereals, and, ornamental, plants, catkin, like, cymes, of, densely, packed, flowers, grow, in, summer, or, fall, amaranth, varies, in, flower, leaf, and, stem, color, with, a, range, of, striking, pigments, from, the, spectrum, of, maroon, to, crimson, and, can, grow, longitudinally, from, 1, to, 2, 5, metres, 3, to, 8, feet, tall, with, a, cylindrical, succulent, fibrous, stem, that, is, hollow, with, grooves, and, bracteoles, when, mature, there, are, approximately, 75, species, in, the, genus, 10, of, which, are, dioecious, and, native, to, north, america, and, the, remaining, 65, are, monoecious, species, that, are, endemic, to, every, continent, except, antarctica, from, tropical, lowlands, to, the, himalayas, members, of, this, genus, share, many, characteristics, and, uses, with, members, of, the, closely, related, genus, celosia, amaranth, grain, is, collected, from, the, genus, the, leaves, of, some, species, are, also, eaten, amaranthus, comes, from, the, name, of, this, plant, in, ancient, greek, amaranth, immortal, noun, formed, from, the, privative, prefix, without, and, the, verb, to, consume, to, exhaust, indeed, the, amaranth, has, a, reputation, for, not, withering, with, in, particular, its, calice, which, remains, persistent, and, for, this, reason, represents, a, symbol, of, immortality, some, species, are, used, in, dry, bouquets, the, form, amaranthus, with, h, comes, from, an, erroneous, association, with, the, greek, etymon, anthos, lat, anthus, meaning, flower, found, in, the, name, of, many, plants, agapanthus, for, example, its, denominations, in, the, languages, of, the, peoples, cultivating, it, since, ancient, times, in, america, are, huauhtli, in, nahuatl, kiwicha, ata, o, in, quechua, tez, or, xtes, in, maya, ahparie, in, pur, pecha, wa, ve, in, huichol, and, guegui, in, tarahumara, amaranth, is, a, herbaceous, plant, or, shrub, that, is, either, annual, or, perennial, across, the, genus, flowers, vary, interspecifically, from, the, presence, of, 3, or, 5, tepals, and, stamens, whereas, a, 7, porate, pollen, grain, structure, remains, consistent, across, the, family, species, across, the, genus, contain, concentric, rings, of, vascular, bundles, and, fix, carbon, efficiently, with, a, c4, photosynthetic, pathway, leaves, are, approximately, 6, 5, 15, centimetres, 2, 1, 2, 6, inches, and, of, oval, or, elliptical, shape, that, are, either, opposite, or, alternate, across, species, although, most, leaves, are, whole, and, simple, with, entire, margins, amaranth, has, a, primary, root, with, deeper, spreading, secondary, fibrous, root, structures, inflorescences, are, in, the, form, a, large, panicle, that, varies, from, terminal, to, axial, color, and, sex, the, tassel, of, fluorescence, is, either, erect, or, bent, and, varies, in, width, and, length, between, species, flowers, are, radially, symmetric, and, either, bisexual, or, unisexual, with, very, small, bristly, perianth, and, pointy, bracts, species, in, this, genus, are, either, monecious, e, g, a, hybridus, or, dioecious, e, g, a, palmeri, fruits, are, in, the, form, of, capsules, referred, to, as, a, unilocular, pixdio, that, opens, at, maturity, the, top, operculum, of, the, unilocular, pixdio, releases, the, urn, that, contains, the, seed, seeds, are, circular, form, from, 1, to, 1, 5, millimeters, in, diameter, and, range, in, color, with, a, shiny, smooth, seed, coat, the, panicle, is, harvested, 200, days, after, cultivation, with, approximately, 1, 000, to, 3, 000, seeds, harvested, per, gram, amaranth, grain, contains, phytochemicals, that, are, not, defined, as, nutrients, and, may, be, antinutrient, factors, such, as, polyphenols, saponins, tannins, and, oxalates, these, compounds, are, reduced, in, content, and, antinutrient, effect, by, cooking, amaranthus, shows, a, wide, variety, of, morphological, diversity, among, and, even, within, certain, species, amaranthus, is, part, of, the, amaranthaceae, that, is, part, of, the, larger, grouping, of, the, carophyllales, although, the, family, amaranthaceae, is, distinctive, the, genus, has, few, distinguishing, characters, among, the, 75, species, present, across, six, continents, this, complicates, taxonomy, and, amaranthus, has, generally, been, considered, among, systematists, as, a, difficult, genus, and, to, hybridize, often, in, 1955, sauer, classified, the, genus, into, two, subgenera, differentiating, only, between, monoecious, and, dioecious, species, acnida, l, aellen, ex, k, r, robertson, and, amaranthus, although, this, classification, was, widely, accepted, further, infrageneric, classification, was, and, still, is, needed, to, differentiate, this, widely, diverse, group, mosyakin, and, robertson, 1996, later, divided, into, three, subgenera, acnida, amaranthus, and, albersia, the, support, for, the, addition, of, the, subdivision, albersia, because, of, its, indehiscent, fruits, coupled, with, three, elliptic, to, linear, tepals, to, be, exclusive, characters, to, members, of, this, subgenus, the, classification, of, these, groups, are, further, supported, with, a, combination, of, floral, characters, reproductive, strategies, geographic, distribution, and, molecular, evidence, the, phylogenies, of, amaranthus, using, maximum, parsimony, and, bayesian, analysis, of, nuclear, and, chloroplast, genes, suggest, five, clades, within, the, genus, diecious, pumilus, hybris, galapagos, eurasian, south, african, australian, esa, esa, south, american, amaranthus, includes, three, recognised, subgenera, and, 75, species, although, species, numbers, are, questionable, due, to, hybridisation, and, species, concepts, infrageneric, classification, focuses, on, inflorescence, flower, characters, and, whether, a, species, is, monoecious, dioecious, as, in, the, sauer, 1955, suggested, classification, bracteole, morphology, present, on, the, stem, is, used, for, taxonomic, classification, of, amaranth, wild, species, have, longer, bracteoles, compared, to, cultivated, species, a, modified, infrageneric, classification, of, amaranthus, includes, three, subgenera, acnida, amaranthus, and, albersia, with, the, taxonomy, further, differentiated, by, sections, within, each, of, the, subgenera, there, is, near, certainty, that, a, hypochondriacus, is, the, common, ancestor, to, the, cultivated, grain, species, however, the, later, series, of, domestication, to, follow, remains, unclear, there, has, been, opposing, hypotheses, of, a, single, as, opposed, to, multiple, domestication, events, of, the, three, grain, species, there, is, evidence, of, phylogenetic, and, geographical, support, for, clear, groupings, that, indicate, separate, domestication, events, in, south, america, and, central, america, a, hybridus, may, derive, from, south, america, whereas, a, caudatus, a, hypochondriacus, and, a, quentiensis, are, native, to, central, and, north, america, species, include, amaranth, derives, from, greek, am, rantos, unfading, with, the, greek, word, for, flower, nthos, factoring, into, the, word, s, development, as, amaranth, the, unfading, flower, amarant, is, an, archaic, variant, the, name, was, first, applied, to, the, related, celosia, amaranthus, and, celosia, share, long, lasting, dried, flowers, as, amaranthus, plants, were, not, yet, known, in, europe, amaranth, weed, species, have, an, extended, period, of, germination, rapid, growth, and, high, rates, of, seed, production, and, have, been, causing, problems, for, farmers, since, the, mid, 1990s, this, is, partially, due, to, the, reduction, in, tillage, reduction, in, herbicidal, use, and, the, evolution, of, herbicidal, resistance, in, several, species, where, herbicides, have, been, applied, more, often, the, following, 9, species, of, amaranthus, are, considered, invasive, and, noxious, weeds, in, the, u, s, and, canada, a, albus, a, blitoides, a, hybridus, a, palmeri, a, powellii, a, retroflexus, a, spinosus, a, tuberculatus, and, a, viridis, a, new, herbicide, resistant, strain, of, a, palmeri, has, appeared, it, is, glyphosate, resistant, and, so, cannot, be, killed, by, herbicides, using, the, chemical, also, this, plant, can, survive, in, tough, conditions, the, species, amaranthus, palmeri, palmer, amaranth, causes, the, greatest, reduction, in, soybean, yields, and, has, the, potential, to, reduce, yields, by, 17, 68, in, field, experiments, palmer, amaranth, is, among, the, top, five, most, troublesome, weeds, in, the, southeast, of, the, united, states, and, has, already, evolved, resistances, to, dinitroaniline, herbicides, and, acetolactate, synthase, inhibitors, this, makes, the, proper, identification, of, amaranthus, species, at, the, seedling, stage, essential, for, agriculturalists, proper, weed, control, needs, to, be, applied, before, the, species, successfully, colonizes, in, the, crop, field, and, causes, significant, yield, reductions, an, evolutionary, lineage, of, around, 90, species, within, the, genus, has, acquired, the, c, 4, carbon, fixation, pathway, which, increases, their, photosynthetic, efficiency, this, probably, occurred, in, the, miocene, all, parts, of, the, plant, are, considered, edible, though, some, may, have, sharp, spines, that, need, to, be, removed, before, consumption, amaranth, is, high, in, oxalates, but, this, may, be, partially, offset, by, its, high, calcium, content, uncooked, amaranth, grain, by, weight, is, 12, water, 65, carbohydrates, including, 7, dietary, fiber, 14, protein, and, 7, fat, table, a, 100, gram, 3, 1, 2, ounce, reference, serving, of, uncooked, amaranth, grain, provides, 1, 550, kilojoules, 371, kilocalories, of, food, energy, and, is, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, protein, dietary, fiber, pantothenic, acid, vitamin, b6, folate, and, several, dietary, minerals, table, uncooked, amaranth, is, particularly, rich, in, manganese, 159, dv, phosphorus, 80, dv, magnesium, 70, dv, iron, 59, dv, and, selenium, 34, dv, amaranth, has, a, high, oxalate, content, cooking, decreases, its, nutritional, value, substantially, across, all, nutrients, with, only, dietary, minerals, remaining, at, moderate, levels, cooked, amaranth, leaves, are, a, rich, source, of, vitamin, a, vitamin, c, calcium, and, manganese, with, moderate, levels, of, folate, iron, magnesium, and, potassium, amaranth, does, not, contain, gluten, the, native, range, of, the, genus, is, cosmopolitan, in, pre, hispanic, times, amaranth, was, cultivated, by, the, aztec, and, their, tributary, communities, in, a, quantity, very, similar, to, maize, known, to, the, aztecs, as, hu, uhtli, amaranth, is, thought, to, have, represented, up, to, 80, of, their, energy, consumption, before, the, spanish, conquest, another, important, use, of, amaranth, throughout, mesoamerica, was, in, ritual, drinks, and, foods, to, this, day, amaranth, grains, are, toasted, much, like, popcorn, and, mixed, with, honey, molasses, or, chocolate, to, make, a, treat, called, alegr, a, meaning, joy, in, spanish, while, all, species, are, believed, to, be, native, to, the, americas, several, have, been, cultivated, and, introduced, to, warm, regions, worldwide, amaranth, s, cosmopolitan, distribution, makes, it, one, of, many, plants, providing, evidence, of, pre, columbian, oceanic, contact, the, earliest, archeological, evidence, for, amaranth, in, the, old, world, was, found, in, an, excavation, in, narhan, india, dated, to, 1000, 800, bce, because, of, its, importance, as, a, symbol, of, indigenous, culture, its, palatability, ease, of, cooking, and, a, protein, that, is, particularly, well, suited, to, human, nutritional, needs, interest, in, amaranth, seeds, especially, a, cruentus, and, a, hypochondriacus, revived, in, the, 1970s, it, was, recovered, in, mexico, from, wild, varieties, and, is, now, commercially, cultivated, it, is, a, popular, snack, in, mexico, sometimes, mixed, with, chocolate, or, puffed, rice, and, its, use, has, spread, to, europe, and, other, parts, of, north, america, several, species, are, raised, for, amaranth, grain, in, asia, and, the, americas, amaranth, and, its, relative, quinoa, are, considered, pseudocereals, because, of, their, similarities, to, cereals, in, flavor, and, cooking, the, spread, of, amaranthus, is, of, a, joint, effort, of, human, expansion, adaptation, and, fertilization, strategies, grain, amaranth, has, been, used, for, food, by, humans, in, several, ways, the, grain, can, be, ground, into, a, flour, for, use, like, other, grain, flours, it, can, be, popped, like, popcorn, or, flaked, like, oatmeal, seeds, of, amaranth, grain, have, been, found, in, antofagasta, de, la, sierra, department, catamarca, argentina, in, the, southern, puna, desert, of, the, north, of, argentina, dating, from, 4, 500, years, ago, with, evidence, suggesting, earlier, use, archeological, evidence, of, seeds, from, a, hypochondriacus, and, a, cruentus, found, in, a, cave, in, tehuac, n, mexico, suggests, amaranth, was, part, of, aztec, civilization, in, the, 1400s, ancient, amaranth, grains, still, used, include, the, three, species, amaranthus, caudatus, a, cruentus, and, a, hypochondriacus, evidence, from, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, and, chromosome, structure, supports, a, hypochondriacus, as, the, common, ancestor, of, the, three, grain, species, it, has, been, proposed, as, an, inexpensive, native, crop, that, could, be, cultivated, by, indigenous, people, in, rural, areas, for, several, reasons, in, the, united, states, the, amaranth, crop, is, mostly, used, for, seed, production, most, amaranth, in, american, food, products, starts, as, a, ground, flour, blended, with, wheat, or, other, flours, to, create, cereals, crackers, cookies, bread, or, other, baked, products, despite, utilization, studies, showing, that, amaranth, can, be, blended, with, other, flours, at, levels, above, 50, without, affecting, functional, properties, or, taste, most, commercial, products, use, amaranth, only, as, a, minor, portion, of, their, ingredients, despite, them, being, marketed, as, amaranth, products, amaranth, species, are, cultivated, and, consumed, as, a, leaf, vegetable, in, many, parts, of, the, world, four, species, of, amaranthus, are, documented, as, cultivated, vegetables, in, eastern, asia, amaranthus, cruentus, amaranthus, blitum, amaranthus, dubius, and, amaranthus, tricolor, in, indonesia, and, malaysia, leaf, amaranth, is, called, bayam,
