among, untreated, acute, cases, 10, will, shed, bacteria, for, three, months, after, initial, onset, of, symptoms, and, 2, 5, will, become, chronic, typhoid, carriers, typhoid, fever, also, known, simply, as, typhoid, is, a, disease, caused, by, salmonella, enterica, serotype, typhi, bacteria, also, called, salmonella, typhi, symptoms, vary, from, mild, to, severe, and, usually, begin, six, to, 30, days, after, exposure, often, there, is, a, gradual, onset, of, a, high, fever, over, several, days, this, is, commonly, accompanied, by, weakness, abdominal, pain, constipation, headaches, and, mild, vomiting, some, people, develop, a, skin, rash, with, rose, colored, spots, in, severe, cases, people, may, experience, confusion, without, treatment, symptoms, may, last, weeks, or, months, diarrhea, may, be, severe, but, is, uncommon, other, people, may, carry, it, without, being, affected, but, are, still, contagious, typhoid, fever, is, a, type, of, enteric, fever, along, with, paratyphoid, fever, salmonella, enterica, typhi, is, believed, to, infect, and, replicate, only, within, humans, typhoid, is, caused, by, the, bacterium, salmonella, enterica, subsp, enterica, serovar, typhi, growing, in, the, intestines, peyer, s, patches, mesenteric, lymph, nodes, spleen, liver, gallbladder, bone, marrow, and, blood, typhoid, is, spread, by, eating, or, drinking, food, or, water, contaminated, with, the, feces, of, an, infected, person, risk, factors, include, limited, access, to, clean, drinking, water, and, poor, sanitation, those, who, have, not, yet, been, exposed, to, it, and, ingest, contaminated, drinking, water, or, food, are, most, at, risk, for, developing, symptoms, only, humans, can, be, infected, there, are, no, known, animal, reservoirs, salmonella, typhi, which, causes, typhoid, fever, is, different, than, the, other, salmonella, bacteria, that, usually, cause, salmonellosis, a, common, type, of, food, poisoning, diagnosis, is, performed, by, culturing, and, identifying, s, enterica, typhi, from, patient, samples, or, detecting, an, immune, response, to, the, pathogen, from, blood, samples, recently, new, advances, in, large, scale, data, collection, and, analysis, have, allowed, researchers, to, develop, better, diagnostics, such, as, detecting, changing, abundances, of, small, molecules, in, the, blood, that, may, specifically, indicate, typhoid, fever, diagnostic, tools, in, regions, where, typhoid, is, most, prevalent, are, quite, limited, in, their, accuracy, and, specificity, and, the, time, required, for, a, proper, diagnosis, the, increasing, spread, of, antibiotic, resistance, and, the, cost, of, testing, are, also, hardships, for, under, resourced, healthcare, systems, a, typhoid, vaccine, can, prevent, about, 40, to, 90, of, cases, during, the, first, two, years, the, vaccine, may, have, some, effect, for, up, to, seven, years, for, those, at, high, risk, or, people, traveling, to, areas, where, it, is, common, vaccination, is, recommended, other, efforts, to, prevent, it, include, providing, clean, drinking, water, good, sanitation, and, handwashing, until, an, infection, is, confirmed, as, cleared, the, infected, person, should, not, prepare, food, for, others, typhoid, is, treated, with, antibiotics, such, as, azithromycin, fluoroquinolones, or, third, generation, cephalosporins, resistance, to, these, antibiotics, has, been, developing, which, has, made, treatment, more, difficult, in, 2015, 12, 5, million, new, typhoid, cases, were, reported, the, disease, is, most, common, in, india, children, are, most, commonly, affected, typhoid, decreased, in, the, developed, world, in, the, 1940s, as, a, result, of, improved, sanitation, and, the, use, of, antibiotics, every, year, about, 400, cases, are, reported, in, the, u, s, and, an, estimated, 6, 000, people, have, typhoid, in, 2015, it, resulted, in, about, 149, 000, deaths, worldwide, down, from, 181, 000, in, 1990, without, treatment, the, risk, of, death, may, be, as, high, as, 20, with, treatment, it, is, between, 1, and, 4, typhus, is, a, different, disease, caused, by, unrelated, species, of, bacteria, owing, to, their, similar, symptoms, they, were, not, recognized, as, distinct, diseases, until, the, 1800s, typhoid, means, resembling, typhus, classically, the, progression, of, untreated, typhoid, fever, has, three, distinct, stages, each, lasting, about, a, week, over, the, course, of, these, stages, the, patient, becomes, exhausted, and, emaciated, the, gram, negative, bacterium, that, causes, typhoid, fever, is, salmonella, enterica, subsp, enterica, serovar, typhi, based, on, mlst, subtyping, scheme, the, two, main, sequence, types, of, the, s, typhi, are, st1, and, st2, which, are, widespread, globally, global, phylogeographical, analysis, showed, dominance, of, a, haplotype, 58, h58, which, probably, originated, in, india, during, the, late, 1980s, and, is, now, spreading, through, the, world, with, multi, drug, resistance, a, more, detailed, genotyping, scheme, was, reported, in, 2016, and, is, now, being, used, widely, this, scheme, reclassified, the, nomenclature, of, h58, to, genotype, 4, 3, 1, unlike, other, strains, of, salmonella, no, animal, carriers, of, typhoid, are, known, humans, are, the, only, known, carriers, of, the, bacterium, s, enterica, subsp, enterica, serovar, typhi, is, spread, by, the, fecal, oral, route, from, people, who, are, infected, and, from, asymptomatic, carriers, of, the, bacterium, an, asymptomatic, human, carrier, is, someone, who, is, still, excreting, typhoid, bacteria, in, stool, a, year, after, the, acute, stage, of, the, infection, diagnosis, is, made, by, any, blood, bone, marrow, or, stool, cultures, and, with, the, widal, test, demonstration, of, antibodies, against, salmonella, antigens, o, somatic, and, h, flagellar, in, epidemics, and, less, wealthy, countries, after, excluding, malaria, dysentery, or, pneumonia, a, therapeutic, trial, time, with, chloramphenicol, is, generally, undertaken, while, awaiting, the, results, of, the, widal, test, and, blood, and, stool, cultures, the, widal, test, is, used, to, identify, specific, antibodies, in, the, serum, of, people, with, typhoid, by, using, antigen, antibody, interactions, in, this, test, the, serum, is, mixed, with, a, dead, bacterial, suspension, of, salmonella, with, specific, antigens, if, the, patient, s, serum, contains, antibodies, against, those, antigens, they, get, attached, to, them, forming, clumps, if, clumping, does, not, occur, the, test, is, negative, the, widal, test, is, time, consuming, and, prone, to, significant, false, positives, it, may, also, be, falsely, negative, in, recently, infected, people, but, unlike, the, typhidot, test, the, widal, test, quantifies, the, specimen, with, titres, rapid, diagnostic, tests, such, as, tubex, typhidot, and, test, it, have, shown, moderate, diagnostic, accuracy, typhidot, is, based, on, the, presence, of, specific, igm, and, igg, antibodies, to, a, specific, 50, kd, omp, antigen, this, test, is, carried, out, on, a, cellulose, nitrate, membrane, where, a, specific, s, typhi, outer, membrane, protein, is, attached, as, fixed, test, lines, it, separately, identifies, igm, and, igg, antibodies, igm, shows, recent, infection, igg, signifies, remote, infection, the, sample, pad, of, this, kit, contains, colloidal, gold, anti, human, igg, or, gold, anti, human, igm, if, the, sample, contains, igg, and, igm, antibodies, against, those, antigens, they, will, react, and, turn, red, the, typhidot, test, becomes, positive, within, 2, 3, days, of, infection, two, colored, bands, indicate, a, positive, test, a, single, control, band, indicates, a, negative, test, a, single, first, fixed, line, or, no, band, at, all, indicates, an, invalid, test, typhidot, s, biggest, limitation, is, that, it, is, not, quantitative, just, positive, or, negative, the, tubex, test, contains, two, types, of, particles, brown, magnetic, particles, coated, with, antigen, and, blue, indicator, particles, coated, with, o9, antibody, during, the, test, if, antibodies, are, present, in, the, serum, they, will, attach, to, the, brown, magnetic, particles, and, settle, at, the, base, while, the, blue, indicator, particles, remain, in, the, solution, producing, a, blue, color, which, means, the, test, is, positive, if, the, serum, does, not, have, an, antibody, in, it, the, blue, particles, attach, to, the, brown, particles, and, settle, at, the, bottom, producing, a, colorless, solution, which, means, the, test, is, negative, sanitation, and, hygiene, are, important, to, prevent, typhoid, it, can, spread, only, in, environments, where, human, feces, can, come, into, contact, with, food, or, drinking, water, careful, food, preparation, and, washing, of, hands, are, crucial, to, prevent, typhoid, industrialization, contributed, greatly, to, the, elimination, of, typhoid, fever, as, it, eliminated, the, public, health, hazards, associated, with, having, horse, manure, in, public, streets, which, led, to, a, large, number, of, flies, which, are, vectors, of, many, pathogens, including, salmonella, spp, according, to, statistics, from, the, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, the, chlorination, of, drinking, water, has, led, to, dramatic, decreases, in, the, transmission, of, typhoid, fever, two, typhoid, vaccines, are, licensed, for, use, for, the, prevention, of, typhoid, the, live, oral, ty21a, vaccine, sold, as, vivotif, by, crucell, switzerland, ag, and, the, injectable, typhoid, polysaccharide, vaccine, sold, as, typhim, vi, by, sanofi, pasteur, and, typherix, by, glaxosmithkline, both, are, efficacious, and, recommended, for, travelers, to, areas, where, typhoid, is, endemic, boosters, are, recommended, every, five, years, for, the, oral, vaccine, and, every, two, years, for, the, injectable, form, an, older, killed, whole, cell, vaccine, is, still, used, in, countries, where, the, newer, preparations, are, not, available, but, this, vaccine, is, no, longer, recommended, for, use, because, it, has, more, side, effects, mainly, pain, and, inflammation, at, the, site, of, the, injection, to, help, decrease, rates, of, typhoid, fever, in, developing, nations, the, world, health, organization, who, endorsed, the, use, of, a, vaccination, program, starting, in, 1999, vaccination, has, proven, effective, at, controlling, outbreaks, in, high, incidence, areas, and, is, also, very, cost, effective, prices, are, normally, less, than, us, 1, per, dose, because, the, price, is, low, poverty, stricken, communities, are, more, willing, to, take, advantage, of, the, vaccinations, although, vaccination, programs, for, typhoid, have, proven, effective, they, alone, cannot, eliminate, typhoid, fever, combining, vaccines, with, public, health, efforts, is, the, only, proven, way, to, control, this, disease, since, the, 1990s, the, who, has, recommended, two, typhoid, fever, vaccines, the, vips, vaccine, is, given, by, injection, and, the, ty21a, by, capsules, only, people, over, age, two, are, recommended, to, be, vaccinated, with, the, vips, vaccine, and, it, requires, a, revaccination, after, 2, 3, years, with, a, 55, 72, efficacy, the, ty21a, vaccine, is, recommended, for, people, five, and, older, lasting, 5, 7, years, with, 51, 67, efficacy, the, two, vaccines, have, proved, safe, and, effective, for, epidemic, disease, control, in, multiple, regions, a, version, of, the, vaccine, combined, with, a, hepatitis, a, vaccine, is, also, available, results, of, a, phase, 3, trial, of, typhoid, conjugate, vaccine, tcv, in, december, 2019, reported, 81, fewer, cases, among, children, the, rediscovery, of, oral, rehydration, therapy, in, the, 1960s, provided, a, simple, way, to, prevent, many, of, the, deaths, of, diarrheal, diseases, in, general, where, resistance, is, uncommon, the, treatment, of, choice, is, a, fluoroquinolone, such, as, ciprofloxacin, otherwise, a, third, generation, cephalosporin, such, as, ceftriaxone, or, cefotaxime, is, the, first, choice, cefixime, is, a, suitable, oral, alternative, properly, treated, typhoid, fever, is, not, fatal, in, most, cases, antibiotics, such, as, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, and, ciprofloxacin, have, been, commonly, used, to, treat, it, treatment, with, antibiotics, reduces, the, case, fatality, rate, to, about, 1, without, treatment, some, patients, develop, sustained, fever, bradycardia, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal, symptoms, and, occasionally, pneumonia, in, white, skinned, patients, pink, spots, which, fade, on, pressure, appear, on, the, skin, of, the, trunk, in, up, to, 20, of, cases, in, the, third, week, untreated, cases, may, develop, gastrointestinal, and, cerebral, complications, which, may, prove, fatal, in, 10, 20, of, cases, the, highest, case, fatality, rates, are, reported, in, children, under, 4, around, 2, 5, of, those, who, contract, typhoid, fever, become, chronic, carriers, as, bacteria, persist, in, the, biliary, tract, after, symptoms, have, resolved, surgery, is, usually, indicated, if, intestinal, perforation, occurs, one, study, found, a, 30, day, mortality, rate, of, 9, 8, 88, and, surgical, site, infections, at, 67, 59, 88, with, the, disease, burden, borne, predominantly, by, low, resource, countries, for, surgical, treatment, most, surgeons, prefer, simple, closure, of, the, perforation, with, drainage, of, the, peritoneum, small, bowel, resection, is, indicated, for, patients, with, multiple, perforations, if, antibiotic, treatment, fails, to, eradicate, the, hepatobiliary, carriage, the, gallbladder, should, be, resected, cholecystectomy, is, sometimes, successful, especially, in, patients, with, gallstones, but, is, not, always, successful, in, eradicating, the, carrier, state, because, of, persisting, hepatic, infection, as, resistance, to, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and, streptomycin, is, now, common, these, agents, are, no, longer, used, as, first, line, treatment, of, typhoid, fever, typhoid, resistant, to, these, agents, is, known, as, multidrug, resistant, typhoid, ciprofloxacin, resistance, is, an, increasing, problem, especially, in, the, indian, subcontinent, and, southeast, asia, many, centres, are, shifting, from, ciprofloxacin, to, ceftriaxone, as, the, first, line, for, treating, suspected, typhoid, originating, in, south, america, india, pakistan, bangladesh, thailand, or, vietnam, also, it, has, been, suggested, that, azithromycin, is, better, at, treating, resistant, typhoid, than, both, fluoroquinolone, drugs, and, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, can, be, taken, by, mouth, and, is, less, expensive, than, ceftriaxone, which, is, given, by, injection, a, separate, problem, exists, with, laboratory, testing, for, reduced, susceptibility, to, ciprofloxacin, current, recommendations, are, that, isolates, should, be, tested, simultaneously, against, ciprofloxacin, cip, and, against, nalidixic, acid, nal, that, isolates, sensitive, to, both, cip, and, nal, should, be, reported, as, sensitive, to, ciprofloxacin, and, that, isolates, sensitive, to, cip, but, not, to, nal, should, be, reported, as, reduced, sensitivity, to, ciprofloxacin, but, an, analysis, of, 271, isolates, found, that, around, 18, of, isolates, with, a, reduced, susceptibility, to, fluoroquinolones, the, class, which, cip, belongs, mic, 0, 125, 1, 0, mg, l, would, not, be, detected, by, this, method, in, 2000, typhoid, fever, caused, an, estimated, 21, 7, million, illnesses, and, 217, 000, deaths, it, occurs, most, often, in, children, and, young, adults, between, 5, and, 19, years, old, in, 2013, it, resulted, in, about, 161, 000, deaths, down, from, 181, 000, in, 1990, infants, children, and, adolescents, in, south, central, and, southeast, asia, have, the, highest, rates, of, typhoid, outbreaks, are, also, often, reported, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, southeast, asia, in, 2000, more, than, 90, of, morbidity, and, mortality, due, to, typhoid, fever, occurred, in, asia, in, the, u, s, about, 400, cases, occur, each, year, 75, of, which, are, acquired, while, traveling, internationally, before, the, antibiotic, era, the, case, fatality, rate, of, typhoid, fever, was, 10, 20, today, with, prompt, treatment, it, is, less, than, 1, but, 3, 5, of, people, who, are, infected, develop, a, chronic, infection, in, the, gall, bladder, since, s, enterica, subsp, enterica, serovar, typhi, is, human, restricted, these, chronic, carriers, become, the, crucial, reservoir, which, can, persist, for, decades, for, further, spread, of, the, disease, further, complicating, its, identification, and, treatment, lately, the, study, of, s, enterica, subsp, enterica, serovar, typhi, associated, with, a, large, outbreak, and, a, carrier, at, the, genome, level, provides, new, insight, into, the, pathogenesis, of, the, pathogen, in, industrialized, nations, water, sanitation, and, food, handling, improvements, have, reduced, the, number, of, typhoid, cases, third, world, nations, have, the, highest, rates, these, areas, lack, access, to, clean, water, proper, sanitation, systems, and, proper, health, care, facilities, in, these, areas, such, access, to, basic, public, health, needs, is, not, expected, in, the, near, future, in, 2004, 2005, an, outbreak, in, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, resulted, in, more, than, 42, 000, cases, and, 214, deaths, since, november, 2016, pakistan, has, had, an, outbreak, of, extensively, drug, resistant, xdr, typhoid, fever, in, europe, a, report, based, on, data, for, 2017, retrieved, from, the, european, surveillance, system, tessy, on, the, distribution, of, confirmed, typhoid, and, paratyphoid, fever, cases, found, that, 22, eu, eea, countries, reported, a, total, of, 1, 098, cases, 90, 9, of, which, were, travel, related, mainly, acquired, during, travel, to, south, asia, the, plague, of, athens, during, the, peloponnesian, war, was, most, likely, an, outbreak, of, typhoid, fever, during, the, war, athenians, retreated, into, a, walled, in, city, to, escape, attack, from, the, spartans, this, massive, influx, of, humans, into, a, concentrated, space, overwhelmed, the, water, supply, and, waste, infrastructure, likely, leading, to, unsanitary, conditions, as, fresh, water, became, harder, to, obtain, and, waste, became, more, difficult, to, collect, and, remove, beyond, the, city, walls, in, 2006, examining, the, remains, for, a, mass, burial, site, from, athens, from, around, the, time, of, the, plague, 430, b, c, revealed, that, fragments, of, dna, similar, to, modern, day, s, typhi, dna, were, detected, whereas, yersinia, pestis, plague, rickettsia, prowazekii, typhus, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, cowpox, virus, and, bartonella, henselae, were, not, detected, in, any, of, the, remains, tested, it, is, possible, that, the, roman, emperor, augustus, caesar, had, either, a, liver, abscess, or, typhoid, fever, and, survived, by, using, ice, baths, and, cold, compresses, as, a, means, of, treatment, for, his, fever, there, is, a, statue, of, the, greek, physician, antonius, musa, who, treated, his, fever, the, french, doctors, pierre, fidele, bretonneau, and, pierre, charles, alexandre, louis, are, credited, with, describing, typhoid, fever, as, a, specific, disease, unique, from, typhus, both, doctors, performed, autopsies, on, individuals, who, died, in, paris, due, to, fever, and, indicated, that, many, had, lesions, on, the, peyer, s, patches, which, correlated, with, distinct, symptoms, before, death, british, medics, were, skeptical, of, the, differentiation, between, typhoid, and, typhus, because, both, were, endemic, to, britain, at, that, time, however, in, france, only, typhoid, was, present, circulating, in, the, population, pierre, charlles, alexandre, louis, also, performed, case, studies, and, statistical, analysis, to, demonstrate, that, typhoid, was, contagious, and, that, persons, who, already, had, the, disease, seemed, to, be, protected, afterward, several, american, doctors, confirmed, these, findings, and, then, sir, william, jenner, convinced, any, remaining, skeptics, that, typhoid, is, a, specific, disease, recognizable, by, lesions, in, the, peyer, s, patches, by, examining, sixty, six, autopsies, from, fever, patients, and, concluding, that, the, symptoms, of, headaches, diarrhea, rash, spots, and, abdominal, pain, were, present, only, in, patients, who, were, found, to, have, intestinal, lesions, after, death, these, observations, solidified, the, association, of, the, disease, with, the, intestinal, tract, and, gave, the, first, clue, to, the, route, of, transmission, in, 1847, william, budd, learned, of, an, epidemic, of, typhoid, fever, in, clifton, and, identified, that, all, 13, of, 34, residents, who, had, contracted, the, disease, drew, their, drinking, water, from, the, same, well, notably, this, observation, was, two, years, prior, to, john, snow, first, publishing, an, early, version, of, his, theory, that, contaminated, water, was, the, central, conduit, for, transmitting, cholera, budd, later, became, health, officer, of, bristol, and, ensured, a, clean, water, supply, and, documented, further, evidence, of, typhoid, as, a, water, borne, illness, throughout, his, career, polish, scientist, tadeusz, browicz, described, a, short, bacillus, in, the, organs, and, feces, of, typhoid, victims, in, 1874, browicz, was, able, to, isolate, and, grow, the, bacilli, but, did, not, go, as, far, as, to, insinuate, or, prove, that, they, caused, the, disease, in, april, 1880, three, months, prior, to, eberth, s, publication, edwin, klebs, described, short, and, filamentous, bacilli, in, the, peyer, s, patches, in, typhoid, victims, the, bacterium, s, role, in, disease, was, speculated, but, not, confirmed, in, 1880, karl, joseph, eberth, described, a, bacillus, that, he, suspected, was, the, cause, of, typhoid, eberth, is, given, credit, for, discovering, the, bacterium, definitively, by, successfully, isolating, the, same, bacterium, from, 18, of, 40, typhoid, victims, and, failing, to, discover, the, bacterium, present, in, any, control, victims, of, other, diseases, in, 1884, pathologist, georg, theodor, august, gaffky, 1850, 1918, confirmed, eberth, s, findings, gaffky, isolated, the, same, bacterium, as, eberth, from, the, spleen, of, a, typhoid, victim, and, was, able, to, grow, the, bacterium, on, solid, media, the, organism, was, given, names, such, as, eberth, s, bacillus, eberthella, typhi, and, gaffky, eberth, bacillus, today, the, bacillus, that, causes, typhoid, fever, goes, by, the, scientific, name, salmonella, enterica, serovar, typhi, most, developed, countries, had, declining, rates, of, typhoid, fever, throughout, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, due, to, vaccinations, and, advances, in, public, sanitation, and, hygiene, in, 1893, attempts, were, made, to, chlorinate, the, water, supply, in, hamburg, germany, and, in, 1897, maidstone, england, was, the, first, town, to, have, its, entire, water, supply, chlorinated, in, 1905, following, an, outbreak, of, typhoid, fever, the, city, of, lincoln, england, instituted, permanent, water, chlorination, the, first, permanent, disinfection, of, drinking, water, in, the, us, was, made, in, 1908, to, the, jersey, city, new, jersey, water, supply, credit, for, the, decision, to, build, the, chlorination, system, has, been, given, to, john, l, leal, the, chlorination, facility, was, designed, by, george, w, fuller, outbreaks, in, traveling, military, groups, led, to, the, creation, of, the, lyster, bag, in, 1915, a, bag, with, a, faucet, which, can, be, hung, from, a, tree, or, pole, filled, with, water, and, comes, with, a, chlorination, tablet, to, drop, into, the, water, the, lyster, bag, was, essential, for, the, survival, of, american, soldiers, in, the, vietnam, war, there, were, several, occurrences, of, milk, delivery, men, spreading, typhoid, fever, throughout, the, communities, they, served, although, typhoid, is, not, spread, through, milk, itself, there, were, several, examples, of, milk, distributors, in, many, locations, watering, their, milk, down, with, contaminated, water, or, cleaning, the, glass, bottles, the, milk, was, placed, in, with, contaminated, water, boston, had, two, such, cases, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, in, 1899, there, were, 24, cases, of, typhoid, traced, to, a, single, milkman, whose, wife, had, died, of, typhoid, fever, a, week, before, the, outbreak, in, 1908, j, j, fallon, who, was, also, a, milkman, died, of, typhoid, fever, following, his, death, and, confirmation, of, the, typhoid, fever, diagnosis, the, city, conducted, an, investigation, of, typhoid, symptoms, and, cases, along, his, route, and, found, evidence, of, a, significant, outbreak, a, month, after, the, outbreak, was, first, reported, the, boston, globe, published, a, short, statement, declaring, the, outbreak, over, stating, t, jamaica, plain, there, is, a, slight, increase, the, total, being, 272, cases, throughout, the, city, there, is, a, total, of, 348, cases, there, was, at, least, one, death, reported, during, this, outbreak, mrs, sophia, s, engstrom, aged, 46, typhoid, continued, to, ravage, the, jamaica, plain, neighborhood, in, particular, throughout, 1908, and, several, more, people, were, reported, dead, due, to, typhoid, fever, although, these, cases, were, not, explicitly, linked, to, the, outbreak, the, jamaica, plain, neighborhood, at, that, time, was, home, to, many, working, class, and, poor, immigrants, mostly, from, ireland, the, most, notorious, carrier, of, typhoid, fever, but, by, no, means, the, most, destructive, was, mary, mallon, known, as, typhoid, mary, although, other, cases, of, human, to, human, spread, of, typhoid, were, known, at, the, time, the, concept, of, an, asymptomatic, carrier, who, was, able, to, transmit, disease, had, only, been, hypothesized, and, not, yet, identified, or, proven, mary, mallon, became, the, first, known, example, of, an, asymptomatic, carrier, of, an, infectious, disease, making, typhoid, fever, the, first, known, disease, being, transmissible, through, asymptomatic, hosts, the, cases, and, deaths, caused, by, mallon, were, mainly, upper, class, families, in, new, york, city, at, the, time, of, mallon, s, tenure, as, a, personal, cook, for, upper, class, families, new, york, city, reported, 3, 000, to, 4, 500, cases, of, typhoid, fever, annually, in, the, summer, of, 1906, two, daughters, of, a, wealthy, family, and, maids, working, in, their, home, became, ill, with, typhoid, fever, after, investigating, their, home, water, sources, and, ruling, out, water, contamination, the, family, hired, civil, engineer, george, soper, to, conduct, an, investigation, of, the, possible, source, of, typhoid, fever, in, the, home, soper, described, himself, as, an, epidemic, fighter, his, investigation, ruled, out, many, sources, of, food, and, led, him, to, question, if, the, cook, the, family, hired, just, prior, to, their, household, outbreak, mallon, was, the, source, since, she, had, already, left, and, begun, employment, elsewhere, he, proceeded, to, track, her, down, in, order, to, obtain, a, stool, sample, when, he, was, able, to, finally, meet, mallon, in, person, he, described, her, by, saying, mary, had, a, good, figure, and, might, have, been, called, athletic, had, she, not, been, a, little, too, heavy, in, recounts, of, soper, s, pursuit, of, mallon, his, only, remorse, appears, to, be, that, he, was, not, given, enough, credit, for, his, relentless, pursuit, and, publication, of, her, personal, identifying, information, stating, that, the, media, rob, me, of, whatever, credit, belongs, to, the, discovery, of, the, first, typhoid, fever, carrier, to, be, found, in, america, ultimately, 51, cases, and, 3, deaths, were, suspected, to, be, caused, by, mallon, in, 1924, the, city, of, portland, oregon, experienced, an, outbreak, of, typhoid, fever, consisting, of, 26, cases, and, 5, deaths, all, deaths, due, to, intestinal, hemorrhage, all, cases, were, concluded, to, be, due, to, a, single, milk, farm, worker, who, was, shedding, large, amounts, of, the, typhoid, pathogen, in, his, urine, misidentification, of, the, disease, due, to, inaccurate, widal, test, results, delayed, identification, of, the, carrier, and, proper, treatment, ultimately, it, took, four, samplings, of, different, secretions, from, all, of, the, dairy, workers, in, order, to, successfully, identify, the, carrier, upon, discovery, the, dairy, worker, was, forcibly, quarantined, for, seven, weeks, and, regular, samples, were, taken, most, of, the, time, the, stool, samples, yielding, no, typhoid, and, often, the, urine, yielding, the, pathogen, the, carrier, was, reported, as, being, 72, years, old, and, appearing, in, excellent, health, with, no, symptoms, pharmaceutical, treatment, decreased, the, amount, of, bacteria, secreted, however, the, infection, was, never, fully, cleared, from, the, urine, and, the, carrier, was, released, under, orders, never, again, to, engage, in, the, handling, of, foods, for, human, consumption, at, the, time, of, release, the, authors, noted, for, more, than, fifty, years, he, has, earned, his, living, chiefly, by, milking, cows, and, knows, little, of, other, forms, of, labor, it, must, be, expected, that, the, closest, surveillance, will, be, necessary, to, make, certain, that, he, does, not, again, engage, in, this, occupation, overall, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, medical, profession, began, to, identify, carriers, of, the, disease, and, evidence, of, transmission, independent, of, water, contamination, in, a, 1933, american, medical, association, publication, physicians, treatment, of, asymptomatic, carriers, is, best, summarized, by, the, opening, line, carriers, of, typhoid, bacilli, are, a, menace, within, the, same, publication, the, first, official, estimate, of, typhoid, carriers, is, given, 2, to, 5, of, all, typhoid, patients, and, distinguished, between, temporary, carriers, and, chronic, carriers, the, authors, further, estimate, that, there, are, four, to, five, chronic, female, carriers, to, every, one, male, carrier, although, offered, no, data, to, explain, this, assertion, of, a, gender, difference, in, the, rate, of, typhoid, carriers, as, far, as, treatment, the, authors, suggest, when, recognized, carriers, must, be, instructed, as, to, the, disposal, of, excreta, as, well, as, to, the, importance, of, personal, cleanliness, they, should, be, forbidden, to, handle, food, or, drink, intended, for, others, and, their, movements, and, whereabouts, must, be, reported, to, the, public, health, officers, today, typhoid, carriers, exist, all, over, the, world, but, the, highest, incidence, of, asymptomatic, infection, is, likely, to, occur, in, south, southeast, asian, and, sub, saharan, countries, the, los, angeles, county, department, of, public, health, tracks, typhoid, carriers, and, reports, the, number, of, carriers, identified, within, the, county, yearly, between, 2006, and, 2016, 0, 4, new, cases, of, typhoid, carriers, were, identified, per, year, cases, of, typhoid, fever, must, be, reported, within, one, working, day, from, identification, as, of, 2018, chronic, typhoid, carriers, must, sign, a, carrier, agreement, and, are, required, to, test, for, typhoid, shedding, twice, yearly, ideally, every, 6, months, carriers, may, be, released, from, their, agreements, upon, fulfilling, release, requirements, based, on, completion, of, a, personalized, treatment, plan, designed, with, medical, professionals, fecal, or, gallbladder, carrier, release, requirements, 6, consecutive, negative, feces, and, urine, specimens, submitted, at, 1, month, or, greater, intervals, beginning, at, least, 7, days, after, completion, of, therapy, urinary, or, kidney, carrier, release, requirements, 6, consecutive, negative, urine, specimens, submitted, at, 1, month, or, greater, intervals, beginning, at, least, 7, days, after, completion, of, therapy, due, to, the, nature, of, asymptomatic, cases, many, questions, remain, about, how, individuals, are, able, to, tolerate, infection, for, long, periods, of, time, how, to, identify, such, cases, and, efficient, options, for, treatment, researchers, are, currently, working, to, understand, asymptomatic, infection, with, salmonella, species, by, studying, infections, in, laboratory, animals, which, will, ultimately, lead, to, improved, prevention, and, treatment, options, for, typhoid, carriers, in, 2002, john, gunn, described, the, ability, of, salmonella, sp, to, form, biofilms, on, gallstones, in, mice, providing, a, model, for, studying, carriage, in, the, gallbladder, denise, monack, and, stanley, falkow, described, a, mouse, model, of, asymptomatic, intestinal, and, systemic, infection, in, 2004, and, monack, went, on, to, demonstrate, that, a, sub, population, of, superspreaders, are, responsible, for, the, majority, of, transmission, to, new, hosts, following, the, 80, 20, rule, of, disease, transmission, and, that, the, intestinal, microbiota, likely, plays, a, role, in, transmission, monack, s, mouse, model, allows, long, term, carriage, of, salmonella, in, mesenteric, lymph, nodes, spleen, and, liver, british, bacteriologist, almroth, edward, wright, first, developed, an, effective, typhoid, vaccine, at, the, army, medical, school, in, netley, hampshire, it, was, introduced, in, 1896, and, used, successfully, by, the, british, during, the, second, boer, war, in, south, africa, at, that, time, typhoid, often, killed, more, soldiers, at, war, than, were, lost, due, to, enemy, combat, wright, further, developed, his, vaccine, at, a, newly, opened, research, department, at, st, mary, s, hospital, medical, school, in, london, from, 1902, where, he, established, a, method, for, measuring, protective, substances, opsonin, in, human, blood, wright, s, version, of, the, typhoid, vaccine, was, produced, by, growing, the, bacterium, at, body, temperature, in, broth, then, heating, the, bacteria, to, 60, c, to, heat, inactivate, the, pathogen, killing, it, while, keeping, the, surface, antigens, intact, the, heat, killed, bacteria, was, then, injected, into, a, patient, to, show, evidence, of, the, vaccine, s, efficacy, wright, then, collected, serum, samples, from, patients, several, weeks, post, vaccination, and, tested, their, serum, s, ability, to, agglutinate, live, typhoid, bacteria, a, positive, result, was, represented, by, clumping, of, bacteria, indicating, that, the, body, was, producing, anti, serum, now, called, antibodies, against, the, pathogen, citing, the, example, of, the, second, boer, war, during, which, many, soldiers, died, from, easily, preventable, diseases, wright, convinced, the, british, army, that, 10, million, vaccine, doses, should, be, produced, for, the, troops, being, sent, to, the, western, front, thereby, saving, up, to, half, a, million, lives, during, world, war, i, the, british, army, was, the, only, combatant, at, the, outbreak, of, the, war, to, have, its, troops, fully, immunized, against, the, bacterium, for, the, first, time, their, casualties, due, to, combat, exceeded, those, from, disease, in, 1909, frederick, f, russell, a, u, s, army, physician, adopted, wright, s, typhoid, vaccine, for, use, with, the, army, and, two, years, later, his, vaccination, program, became, the, first, in, which, an, entire, army, was, immunized, it, eliminated, typhoid, as, a, significant, cause, of, morbidity, and, mortality, in, the, u, s, military, typhoid, vaccination, for, members, of, the, american, military, became, mandatory, in, 1911, before, the, vaccine, the, rate, of, typhoid, fever, in, the, military, was, 14, 000, or, greater, per, 100, 000, soldiers, by, world, war, i, the, rate, of, typhoid, in, american, soldiers, was, 37, per, 100, 000, during, the, second, world, war, the, united, states, army, authorized, the, use, of, a, trivalent, vaccine, containing, heat, inactivated, typhoid, paratyphi, a, and, paratyphi, b, pathogens, in, 1934, discovery, of, the, vi, capsular, antigen, by, arthur, felix, and, miss, s, r, margaret, pitt, enabled, development, of, the, safer, vi, antigen, vaccine, which, is, widely, in, use, today, arthur, felix, and, margaret, pitt, also, isolated, the, strain, ty2, which, became, the, parent, strain, of, ty21a, the, strain, used, as, a, live, attenuated, vaccine, for, typhoid, fever, today, chloramphenicol, was, isolated, from, streptomyces, by, david, gotlieb, during, the, 1940s, in, 1948, american, army, doctors, tested, its, efficacy, in, treating, typhoid, patients, in, kuala, lumpur, malaysia, individuals, who, received, a, full, course, of, treatment, cleared, the, infection, whereas, patients, given, a, lower, dose, had, a, relapse, asymptomatic, carriers, continued, to, shed, bacilli, despite, chloramphenicol, treatment, only, ill, patients, were, improved, with, chloramphenicol, resistance, to, chloramphenicol, became, frequent, in, southeast, asia, by, the, 1950s, and, today, chloramphenicol, is, only, used, as, a, last, resort, due, to, the, high, prevalence, of, resistance, the, disease, has, been, referred, to, by, various, names, often, associated, with, symptoms, such, as, gastric, fever, enteric, fever, abdominal, typhus, infantile, remittant, fever, slow, fever, nervous, fever, pythogenic, fever, drain, fever, and, low, fever
