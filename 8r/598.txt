theropsida, seeley, 1895, pelycosauria, cladistically, including, therapsids, synapsida, is, one, of, the, two, major, clades, of, vertebrate, animals, in, the, group, amniota, the, other, being, the, sauropsida, which, includes, reptiles, and, birds, the, synapsids, were, the, dominant, land, animals, in, the, late, paleozoic, and, early, mesozoic, but, the, only, group, that, survived, into, the, cenozoic, are, mammals, unlike, other, amniotes, synapsids, have, a, single, temporal, fenestra, an, opening, low, in, the, skull, roof, behind, each, eye, orbit, leaving, a, bony, arch, beneath, each, this, accounts, for, their, name, the, distinctive, temporal, fenestra, developed, about, 318, million, years, ago, during, the, late, carboniferous, period, when, synapsids, and, sauropsids, diverged, but, was, subsequently, merged, with, the, orbit, in, early, mammals, the, animals, basal, amniotes, from, which, non, mammalian, synapsids, evolved, were, traditionally, called, reptiles, therefore, synapsids, were, described, as, mammal, like, reptiles, in, classical, systematics, and, non, therapsid, synapsids, were, also, referred, to, as, pelycosaurs, or, pelycosaur, grade, synapsids, these, paraphyletic, terms, have, now, fallen, out, of, favor, and, are, only, used, informally, if, at, all, in, modern, literature, it, is, now, known, that, all, extant, animals, traditionally, called, reptiles, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, synapsids, so, the, word, reptile, has, been, re, defined, to, mean, only, members, of, sauropsida, bird, line, amniota, or, even, just, an, under, clade, thereof, and, synapsids, are, not, part, of, the, sauropsid, lineage, in, a, cladistic, sense, therefore, calling, synapsids, mammal, like, reptiles, is, incorrect, under, the, new, definition, of, reptile, so, they, are, now, referred, to, as, stem, mammals, proto, mammals, paramammals, or, pan, mammals, synapsids, were, the, largest, terrestrial, vertebrates, in, the, permian, period, 299, to, 251, million, years, ago, equalled, only, by, some, large, pareiasaurs, at, the, end, of, the, permian, most, lineages, of, pelycosaur, grade, synapsids, were, replaced, at, the, end, of, the, early, permian, by, the, more, advanced, therapsids, synapsid, numbers, and, variety, were, severely, reduced, by, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, only, the, therapsid, dicynodonts, and, eutheriodonts, consisting, of, therocephalia, and, cynodontia, are, known, to, have, continued, into, the, triassic, period, the, cynodont, group, probainognathia, which, includes, mammaliaformes, mammals, and, their, closer, ancestors, were, the, only, synapsids, to, survive, beyond, the, triassic, during, the, triassic, the, sauropsid, archosaurs, became, some, of, the, largest, and, most, numerous, land, vertebrates, only, rivaled, in, size, by, kannemeyeriiform, dicynodonts, and, gave, rise, to, the, dinosaurs, when, all, non, avian, dinosaurs, were, wiped, out, by, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, the, mammalian, synapsids, diversified, again, to, become, the, largest, land, and, marine, animals, on, earth, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, synapsids, were, thought, to, be, one, of, the, four, main, subclasses, of, reptiles, however, this, notion, was, disproved, upon, closer, inspection, of, skeletal, remains, as, synapsids, are, differentiated, from, reptiles, by, their, distinctive, temporal, openings, these, openings, in, the, skull, bones, allowed, the, attachment, of, larger, jaw, muscles, hence, a, more, efficient, bite, synapsids, were, subsequently, considered, to, be, a, later, reptilian, lineage, that, became, mammals, by, gradually, evolving, increasingly, mammalian, features, hence, the, name, mammal, like, reptiles, also, known, as, pelycosaurs, these, became, the, traditional, terms, for, all, paleozoic, early, synapsids, more, recent, studies, have, debunked, this, notion, as, well, and, reptiles, are, now, classified, within, sauropsida, sauropsids, the, sister, group, to, synapsids, thus, making, synapsids, their, own, taxonomic, group, as, a, result, the, paraphyletic, terms, mammal, like, reptile, and, pelycosaur, are, seen, as, outdated, and, disfavored, in, technical, literature, and, the, term, stem, mammal, or, sometimes, protomammal, or, paramammal, is, used, instead, phylogenetically, it, is, now, understood, that, synapsids, comprise, an, independent, branch, of, the, tree, of, life, the, monophyly, of, synapsida, is, not, in, doubt, and, the, expressions, such, as, synapsida, contains, the, mammals, and, synapsids, gave, rise, to, the, mammals, both, express, the, same, phylogenetic, hypothesis, this, terminology, reflects, the, modern, cladistic, approach, to, animal, relationships, according, to, which, the, only, valid, groups, are, those, that, include, all, of, the, descendants, of, a, common, ancestor, these, are, known, as, monophyletic, groups, or, clades, additionally, reptilia, reptiles, has, been, revised, into, a, monophyletic, group, and, is, considered, entirely, distinct, from, synapsida, falling, within, sauropsida, the, sister, group, of, synapsida, within, amniota, the, synapsids, are, traditionally, divided, for, convenience, into, therapsids, an, advanced, group, of, synapsids, and, the, branch, within, which, mammals, evolved, and, stem, mammals, previously, known, as, pelycosaurs, comprising, the, other, six, more, primitive, families, of, synapsids, stem, mammals, were, all, rather, lizard, like, with, sprawling, gait, and, possibly, horny, scutes, while, therapsids, tended, to, have, a, more, erect, pose, and, possibly, hair, at, least, in, some, forms, in, traditional, taxonomy, the, synapsida, encompasses, two, distinct, grades, the, low, slung, stem, mammals, have, given, rise, to, the, more, erect, therapsids, who, in, their, turn, have, given, rise, to, the, mammals, in, traditional, vertebrate, classification, the, stem, mammals, and, therapsids, were, both, considered, orders, of, the, subclass, synapsida, in, phylogenetic, nomenclature, the, terms, are, used, somewhat, differently, as, the, daughter, clades, are, included, most, papers, published, during, the, 21st, century, have, treated, pelycosaur, as, an, informal, grouping, of, primitive, members, therapsida, has, remained, in, use, as, a, clade, containing, both, the, traditional, therapsid, families, and, mammals, although, synapsida, and, therapsida, include, modern, mammals, in, practical, usage, those, two, terms, are, used, almost, exclusively, when, referring, to, the, more, basal, members, that, lie, outside, of, mammaliaformes, synapsids, evolved, a, temporal, fenestra, behind, each, eye, orbit, on, the, lateral, surface, of, the, skull, it, may, have, provided, new, attachment, sites, for, jaw, muscles, a, similar, development, took, place, in, the, diapsids, which, evolved, two, rather, than, one, opening, behind, each, eye, originally, the, openings, in, the, skull, left, the, inner, cranium, covered, only, by, the, jaw, muscles, but, in, higher, therapsids, and, mammals, the, sphenoid, bone, has, expanded, to, close, the, opening, this, has, left, the, lower, margin, of, the, opening, as, an, arch, extending, from, the, lower, edges, of, the, braincase, synapsids, are, characterized, by, having, differentiated, teeth, these, include, the, canines, molars, and, incisors, the, trend, towards, differentiation, is, found, in, some, labyrinthodonts, and, early, anapsid, reptilians, in, the, form, of, enlargement, of, the, first, teeth, on, the, maxilla, forming, a, form, of, protocanines, this, trait, was, subsequently, lost, in, the, diapsid, line, but, developed, further, in, the, synapsids, early, synapsids, could, have, two, or, even, three, enlarged, canines, but, in, the, therapsids, the, pattern, had, settled, to, one, canine, in, each, upper, jaw, half, the, lower, canines, developed, later, the, jaw, transition, is, a, good, classification, tool, as, most, other, fossilized, features, that, make, a, chronological, progression, from, a, reptile, like, to, a, mammalian, condition, follow, the, progression, of, the, jaw, transition, the, mandible, or, lower, jaw, consists, of, a, single, tooth, bearing, bone, in, mammals, the, dentary, whereas, the, lower, jaw, of, modern, and, prehistoric, reptiles, consists, of, a, conglomeration, of, smaller, bones, including, the, dentary, articular, and, others, as, they, evolved, in, synapsids, these, jaw, bones, were, reduced, in, size, and, either, lost, or, in, the, case, of, the, articular, gradually, moved, into, the, ear, forming, one, of, the, middle, ear, bones, while, modern, mammals, possess, the, malleus, incus, and, stapes, basal, synapsids, like, all, other, tetrapods, possess, only, a, stapes, the, malleus, is, derived, from, the, articular, a, lower, jaw, bone, while, the, incus, is, derived, from, the, quadrate, a, cranial, bone, mammalian, jaw, structures, are, also, set, apart, by, the, dentary, squamosal, jaw, joint, in, this, form, of, jaw, joint, the, dentary, forms, a, connection, with, a, depression, in, the, squamosal, known, as, the, glenoid, cavity, in, contrast, all, other, jawed, vertebrates, including, reptiles, and, nonmammalian, synapsids, possess, a, jaw, joint, in, which, one, of, the, smaller, bones, of, the, lower, jaw, the, articular, makes, a, connection, with, a, bone, of, the, cranium, called, the, quadrate, bone, to, form, the, articular, quadrate, jaw, joint, in, forms, transitional, to, mammals, the, jaw, joint, is, composed, of, a, large, lower, jaw, bone, similar, to, the, dentary, found, in, mammals, that, does, not, connect, to, the, squamosal, but, connects, to, the, quadrate, with, a, receding, articular, bone, over, time, as, synapsids, became, more, mammalian, and, less, reptilian, they, began, to, develop, a, secondary, palate, separating, the, mouth, and, nasal, cavity, in, early, synapsids, a, secondary, palate, began, to, form, on, the, sides, of, the, maxilla, still, leaving, the, mouth, and, nostril, connected, eventually, the, two, sides, of, the, palate, began, to, curve, together, forming, a, u, shape, instead, of, a, c, shape, the, palate, also, began, to, extend, back, toward, the, throat, securing, the, entire, mouth, and, creating, a, full, palatine, bone, the, maxilla, is, also, closed, completely, in, fossils, of, one, of, the, first, eutheriodonts, the, beginnings, of, a, palate, are, clearly, visible, the, later, thrinaxodon, has, a, full, and, completely, closed, palate, forming, a, clear, progression, in, addition, to, the, glandular, skin, covered, in, fur, found, in, most, modern, mammals, modern, and, extinct, synapsids, possess, a, variety, of, modified, skin, coverings, including, osteoderms, bony, armor, embedded, in, the, skin, scutes, protective, structures, of, the, dermis, often, with, a, horny, covering, hair, or, fur, and, scale, like, structures, often, formed, from, modified, hair, as, in, pangolins, and, some, rodents, while, the, skin, of, reptiles, is, rather, thin, that, of, mammals, has, a, thick, dermal, layer, the, ancestral, skin, type, of, synapsids, has, been, subject, to, discussion, the, type, specimen, of, the, oldest, known, synapsid, asaphestera, preserved, scales, among, the, early, synapsids, only, two, species, of, small, varanopids, have, been, found, to, possess, osteoderms, fossilized, rows, of, osteoderms, indicate, bony, armour, on, the, neck, and, back, however, some, recent, studies, have, cast, doubt, on, the, placement, of, varanopidae, in, synapsida, while, others, have, countered, and, lean, towards, this, traditional, placement, skin, impressions, indicate, some, early, synapsids, basal, possessed, rectangular, scutes, on, their, undersides, and, tails, the, pelycosaur, scutes, probably, were, nonoverlapping, dermal, structures, with, a, horny, overlay, like, those, found, in, modern, crocodiles, and, turtles, these, differed, in, structure, from, the, scales, of, lizards, and, snakes, which, are, an, epidermal, feature, like, mammalian, hair, or, avian, feathers, recently, skin, impressions, from, the, genus, ascendonanus, suggest, that, at, least, varanopsids, developed, scales, similar, to, those, of, squamates, it, is, currently, unknown, exactly, when, mammalian, characteristics, such, as, body, hair, and, mammary, glands, first, appeared, as, the, fossils, only, rarely, provide, direct, evidence, for, soft, tissues, an, exceptionally, well, preserved, skull, of, estemmenosuchus, a, therapsid, from, the, upper, permian, preserves, smooth, skin, with, what, appear, to, be, glandular, depressions, an, animal, noted, as, being, semi, aquatic, the, oldest, known, fossil, showing, unambiguous, imprints, of, hair, is, the, callovian, late, middle, jurassic, castorocauda, and, several, contemporary, haramiyidans, both, non, mammalian, mammaliaform, see, below, however, more, primitive, members, of, the, cynodontia, are, also, hypothesized, to, have, had, fur, or, a, fur, like, covering, based, on, their, inferred, warm, blooded, metabolism, while, more, direct, evidence, of, fur, in, early, cynodonts, has, been, proposed, in, the, form, of, small, pits, on, the, snout, possibly, associated, with, whiskers, such, pits, are, also, found, in, some, reptiles, that, lack, whiskers, there, is, evidence, that, some, other, non, mammalian, cynodonts, more, basal, than, castorocauda, such, as, morganucodon, had, harderian, glands, which, are, associated, with, the, grooming, and, maintenance, of, fur, the, apparent, absence, of, these, glands, in, non, mammaliaformes, may, suggest, that, fur, did, not, originate, until, that, point, in, synapsid, evolution, it, is, possible, that, fur, and, associated, features, of, true, warm, bloodedness, did, not, appear, until, some, synapsids, became, extremely, small, and, nocturnal, necessitating, a, higher, metabolism, the, oldest, examples, of, nocturnality, in, synapsids, is, believed, to, have, been, in, species, that, lived, more, than, 300, million, years, ago, however, late, permian, coprolites, from, russia, and, possibly, south, africa, showcase, that, at, least, some, synapsids, did, already, have, pre, mammalian, hair, in, this, epoch, these, are, the, oldest, impressions, of, hair, like, structures, on, synapsids, early, synapsids, as, far, back, as, their, known, evolutionary, debut, in, the, late, carboniferous, period, may, have, laid, parchment, shelled, leathery, eggs, which, lacked, a, calcified, layer, as, most, modern, reptiles, and, monotremes, do, this, may, also, explain, why, there, is, no, fossil, evidence, for, synapsid, eggs, to, date, because, they, were, vulnerable, to, desiccation, secretions, from, apocrine, like, glands, may, have, helped, keep, the, eggs, moist, according, to, oftedal, early, synapsids, may, have, buried, the, eggs, into, moisture, laden, soil, hydrating, them, with, contact, with, the, moist, skin, or, may, have, carried, them, in, a, moist, pouch, similar, to, that, of, monotremes, echidnas, carry, their, eggs, and, offspring, via, a, temporary, pouch, though, this, would, limit, the, mobility, of, the, parent, the, latter, may, have, been, the, primitive, form, of, egg, care, in, synapsids, rather, than, simply, burying, the, eggs, and, the, constraint, on, the, parent, s, mobility, would, have, been, solved, by, having, the, eggs, parked, in, nests, during, foraging, or, other, activities, and, periodically, be, hydrated, allowing, higher, clutch, sizes, than, could, fit, inside, a, pouch, or, pouches, at, once, and, large, eggs, which, would, be, cumbersome, to, carry, in, a, pouch, would, be, easier, to, care, for, the, basis, of, oftedal, s, speculation, is, the, fact, that, many, species, of, anurans, can, carry, eggs, or, tadpoles, attached, to, the, skin, or, embedded, within, cutaneous, pouches, and, how, most, salamanders, curl, around, their, eggs, to, keep, them, moist, both, groups, also, having, glandular, skin, the, glands, involved, in, this, mechanism, would, later, evolve, into, true, mammary, glands, with, multiple, modes, of, secretion, in, association, with, hair, follicles, comparative, analyses, of, the, evolutionary, origin, of, milk, constituents, support, a, scenario, in, which, the, secretions, from, these, glands, evolved, into, a, complex, nutrient, rich, milk, long, before, true, mammals, arose, with, some, of, the, constituents, possibly, predating, the, split, between, the, synapsid, and, sauropsid, lines, cynodonts, were, almost, certainly, able, to, produce, this, which, allowed, a, progressive, decline, of, yolk, mass, and, thus, egg, size, resulting, in, increasingly, altricial, hatchlings, as, milk, became, the, primary, source, of, nutrition, which, is, all, evidenced, by, the, small, body, size, the, presence, of, epipubic, bones, and, limited, tooth, replacement, in, advanced, cynodonts, as, well, as, in, mammaliaforms, aerial, locomotion, first, began, in, non, mammalian, haramiyidan, cynodonts, with, arboroharamiya, xianshou, maiopatagium, and, vilevolodon, bearing, exquisitely, preserved, fur, covered, wing, membranes, that, stretch, across, the, limbs, and, tail, their, fingers, are, elongated, similar, to, those, of, bats, and, colugos, and, likely, sharing, similar, roles, both, as, wing, supports, and, to, hang, on, tree, branches, within, true, mammals, aerial, locomotion, first, occurs, in, volaticotherian, eutriconodonts, a, fossil, volaticotherium, has, an, exquisitely, preserved, furry, patagium, with, delicate, wrinkles, and, that, is, very, extensive, sandwiching, the, poorly, preserved, hands, and, feet, and, extending, to, the, base, of, the, tail, argentoconodon, a, close, relative, shares, a, similar, femur, adapted, for, flight, stresses, indicating, a, similar, lifestyle, therian, mammals, would, only, achieve, powered, flight, and, gliding, long, after, these, early, aeronauts, became, extinct, with, the, earliest, known, gliding, metatherians, and, bats, evolving, in, the, paleocene, recently, it, has, been, found, that, endothermy, was, developed, as, early, as, ophiacodon, in, the, late, carboniferous, the, presence, of, fibrolamellar, a, specialised, type, of, bone, that, can, grow, quickly, while, maintaining, a, stable, structure, shows, that, ophiacodon, would, have, used, its, high, internal, body, temperature, to, fuel, a, fast, growth, comparable, to, modern, endotherms, over, the, course, of, synapsid, evolution, progenitor, taxa, at, the, start, of, adaptive, radiations, have, tended, to, be, derived, carnivores, synapsid, adaptive, radiations, have, generally, occurred, after, extinction, events, that, depleted, the, biosphere, and, left, vacant, niches, open, to, be, filled, by, newly, evolved, taxa, in, non, mammaliaform, synapsids, those, taxa, that, gave, rise, to, rapidly, diversifying, lineages, have, been, both, small, and, large, in, body, size, although, after, the, late, triassic, progenitors, of, new, synapsid, lineages, have, generally, been, small, unspecialised, generalists, the, earliest, known, synapsid, asaphestera, coexisted, with, the, earliest, known, sauropsid, hylonomus, which, lived, during, the, bashkirian, age, of, the, late, carboniferous, it, was, one, of, many, types, of, primitive, synapsids, that, are, now, informally, grouped, together, as, stem, mammals, or, sometimes, as, protomammals, previously, known, as, pelycosaurs, the, early, synapsids, spread, and, diversified, becoming, the, largest, terrestrial, animals, in, the, latest, carboniferous, and, early, permian, periods, ranging, up, to, 6, metres, 20, ft, in, length, they, were, sprawling, bulky, possibly, cold, blooded, and, had, small, brains, some, such, as, dimetrodon, had, large, sails, that, might, have, helped, raise, their, body, temperature, a, few, relict, groups, lasted, into, the, later, permian, but, by, the, middle, of, the, late, permian, all, had, either, died, off, or, evolved, into, their, successors, the, therapsids, the, therapsids, a, more, advanced, group, of, synapsids, appeared, during, the, middle, permian, and, included, the, largest, terrestrial, animals, in, the, middle, and, late, permian, they, included, herbivores, and, carnivores, ranging, from, small, animals, the, size, of, a, rat, e, g, robertia, to, large, bulky, herbivores, a, ton, or, more, in, weight, e, g, moschops, after, flourishing, for, many, millions, of, years, these, successful, animals, were, all, but, wiped, out, by, the, permian, triassic, mass, extinction, about, 250, mya, the, largest, known, extinction, in, earth, s, history, possibly, related, to, the, siberian, traps, volcanic, event, only, a, few, therapsids, went, on, to, be, successful, in, the, new, early, triassic, landscape, they, include, lystrosaurus, and, cynognathus, the, latter, of, which, appeared, later, in, the, early, triassic, however, they, were, accompanied, by, the, early, archosaurs, soon, to, give, rise, to, the, dinosaurs, some, of, these, archosaurs, such, as, euparkeria, were, small, and, lightly, built, while, others, such, as, erythrosuchus, were, as, big, as, or, bigger, than, the, largest, therapsids, after, the, permian, extinction, the, synapsids, did, not, count, more, than, three, surviving, clades, the, first, comprised, the, therocephalians, which, only, lasted, the, first, 20, million, years, of, the, triassic, period, the, second, were, specialised, beaked, herbivores, known, as, dicynodonts, such, as, the, kannemeyeriidae, which, contained, some, members, that, reached, large, size, up, to, a, tonne, or, more, and, finally, there, were, the, increasingly, mammal, like, carnivorous, herbivorous, and, insectivorous, cynodonts, including, the, eucynodonts, from, the, olenekian, age, an, early, representative, of, which, was, cynognathus, unlike, the, dicynodonts, which, were, large, the, cynodonts, became, progressively, smaller, and, more, mammal, like, as, the, triassic, progressed, though, some, forms, like, trucidocynodon, remained, large, the, first, mammaliaforms, evolved, from, the, cynodonts, during, the, early, norian, age, of, the, late, triassic, about, 225, mya, during, the, evolutionary, succession, from, early, therapsid, to, cynodont, to, eucynodont, to, mammal, the, main, lower, jaw, bone, the, dentary, replaced, the, adjacent, bones, thus, the, lower, jaw, gradually, became, just, one, large, bone, with, several, of, the, smaller, jaw, bones, migrating, into, the, inner, ear, and, allowing, sophisticated, hearing, whether, through, climate, change, vegetation, change, ecological, competition, or, a, combination, of, factors, most, of, the, remaining, large, cynodonts, belonging, to, the, traversodontidae, and, dicynodonts, of, the, family, kannemeyeriidae, had, disappeared, by, the, rhaetian, age, even, before, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, event, that, killed, off, most, of, the, large, non, dinosaurian, archosaurs, the, remaining, mesozoic, synapsids, were, small, ranging, from, the, size, of, a, shrew, to, the, badger, like, mammal, repenomamus, during, the, jurassic, and, cretaceous, the, remaining, non, mammalian, cynodonts, were, small, such, as, tritylodon, no, cynodont, grew, larger, than, a, cat, most, jurassic, and, cretaceous, cynodonts, were, herbivorous, though, some, were, carnivorous, the, family, tritheledontidae, which, first, appeared, near, the, end, of, the, triassic, was, carnivorous, and, persisted, well, into, the, middle, jurassic, the, other, tritylodontidae, first, appeared, at, the, same, time, as, the, tritheledonts, but, was, herbivorous, this, group, became, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, early, cretaceous, epoch, dicynodonts, are, generally, thought, to, have, become, extinct, near, the, end, of, the, triassic, period, but, there, was, evidence, this, group, survived, in, the, form, of, six, fragments, of, fossil, bone, that, were, found, in, cretaceous, rocks, of, queensland, australia, if, true, it, would, mean, there, is, a, significant, ghost, lineage, of, dicynodonts, in, gondwana, however, these, fossils, were, re, described, in, 2019, as, being, pleistocene, in, age, and, possibly, belonging, to, a, diprotodontid, marsupial, today, the, 5, 500, species, of, living, synapsids, known, as, the, mammals, include, both, aquatic, whales, and, flying, bats, species, and, the, largest, animal, ever, known, to, have, existed, the, blue, whale, humans, are, synapsids, as, well, most, mammals, are, viviparous, and, give, birth, to, live, young, rather, than, laying, eggs, with, the, exception, being, the, monotremes, triassic, and, jurassic, ancestors, of, living, mammals, along, with, their, close, relatives, had, high, metabolic, rates, this, meant, consuming, food, generally, thought, to, be, insects, in, much, greater, quantity, to, facilitate, rapid, digestion, these, synapsids, evolved, mastication, chewing, and, specialized, teeth, that, aided, chewing, limbs, also, evolved, to, move, under, the, body, instead, of, to, the, side, allowing, them, to, breathe, more, efficiently, during, locomotion, this, helped, make, it, possible, to, support, their, higher, metabolic, demands, below, is, a, cladogram, of, the, most, commonly, accepted, phylogeny, of, synapsids, showing, a, long,

sphenacodontidae, biarmosuchia, dinocephalia, anomodontia, gorgonopsia, therocephalia, cynognathia, mammalia, most, uncertainty, in, the, phylogeny, of, synapsids, lies, among, the, earliest, members, of, the, group, including, forms, traditionally, placed, within, pelycosauria, as, one, of, the, earliest, phylogenetic, analyses, brinkman, eberth, 1983, placed, the, family, varanopidae, with, caseasauria, as, the, most, basal, offshoot, of, the, synapsid, lineage, reisz, 1986, removed, varanopidae, from, caseasauria, placing, it, in, a, more, derived, position, on, the, stem, while, most, analyses, find, caseasauria, to, be, the, most, basal, synapsid, clade, benson, s, analysis, 2012, placed, a, clade, containing, ophiacodontidae, and, varanopidae, as, the, most, basal, synapsids, with, caseasauria, occupying, a, more, derived, position, benson, attributed, this, revised, phylogeny, to, the, inclusion, of, postcranial, characteristics, or, features, of, the, skeleton, other, than, the, skull, in, his, analysis, when, only, cranial, or, skull, features, were, included, caseasauria, remained, the, most, basal, synapsid, clade, below, is, a, cladogram, modified, from,

however, more, recent, examination, of, the, phylogeny, of, basal, synapsids, incorporating, newly, described, basal, caseids, and, eothyridids, returned, caseasauria, to, its, position, as, the, sister, to, all, other, synapsids, brocklehurst, et, al, 2016, demonstrated, that, many, of, the, postcranial, characters, used, by, benson, 2012, to, unite, caseasauria, with, sphenacodontidae, and, edaphosauridae, were, absent, in, the, newly, discovered, postcranial, material, of, eothyridids, and, were, therefore, acquired, convergently
