nicotine, is, a, naturally, produced, alkaloid, in, the, nightshade, family, of, plants, most, predominantly, in, tobacco, and, duboisia, hopwoodii, and, is, widely, used, recreationally, as, a, stimulant, and, anxiolytic, as, a, pharmaceutical, drug, it, is, used, for, smoking, cessation, to, relieve, withdrawal, symptoms, nicotine, acts, as, a, receptor, agonist, at, most, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptors, nachrs, except, at, two, nicotinic, receptor, subunits, nachr, 9, and, nachr, 10, where, it, acts, as, a, receptor, antagonist, nicotine, constitutes, approximately, 0, 6, 3, 0, of, the, dry, weight, of, tobacco, nicotine, is, also, present, at, ppb, concentrations, in, edible, plants, in, the, family, solanaceae, including, potatoes, tomatoes, and, eggplants, though, sources, disagree, on, whether, this, has, any, biological, significance, to, human, consumers, it, functions, as, an, antiherbivore, toxin, consequently, nicotine, was, widely, used, as, an, insecticide, in, the, past, and, neonicotinoids, structurally, similar, to, nicotine, such, as, imidacloprid, are, some, of, the, most, effective, and, widely, used, insecticides, nicotine, is, highly, addictive, slow, release, forms, gums, and, patches, when, used, correctly, can, be, less, addictive, and, help, in, quitting, animal, research, suggests, that, monoamine, oxidase, inhibitors, present, in, tobacco, smoke, may, enhance, nicotine, s, addictive, properties, an, average, cigarette, yields, about, 2, mg, of, absorbed, nicotine, the, estimated, lower, dose, limit, for, fatal, outcomes, is, 500, 1, 000, mg, of, ingested, nicotine, for, an, adult, 6, 5, 13, mg, kg, nicotine, addiction, involves, drug, reinforced, behavior, compulsive, use, and, relapse, following, abstinence, nicotine, dependence, involves, tolerance, sensitization, physical, dependence, psychological, dependence, and, can, cause, distress, nicotine, withdrawal, symptoms, include, depressed, mood, stress, anxiety, irritability, difficulty, concentrating, and, sleep, disturbances, mild, nicotine, withdrawal, symptoms, are, measurable, in, unrestricted, smokers, who, experience, normal, moods, only, as, their, blood, nicotine, levels, peak, with, each, cigarette, on, quitting, withdrawal, symptoms, worsen, sharply, then, gradually, improve, to, a, normal, state, nicotine, use, as, a, tool, for, quitting, smoking, has, a, good, safety, history, animal, studies, suggest, that, nicotine, may, adversely, affect, cognitive, development, in, adolescence, but, the, relevance, of, these, findings, to, human, brain, development, is, disputed, at, low, amounts, it, has, a, mild, analgesic, effect, according, to, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, nicotine, is, not, generally, considered, to, be, a, carcinogen, the, surgeon, general, of, the, united, states, indicates, that, evidence, is, inadequate, to, infer, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, causal, relationship, between, exposure, to, nicotine, and, risk, for, cancer, nicotine, has, been, shown, to, produce, birth, defects, in, humans, and, is, considered, a, teratogen, the, median, lethal, dose, of, nicotine, in, humans, is, unknown, high, doses, are, known, to, cause, nicotine, poisoning, organ, failure, and, death, through, paralysis, of, respiratory, muscles, though, serious, or, fatal, overdoses, are, rare, the, primary, therapeutic, use, of, nicotine, is, treating, nicotine, dependence, to, eliminate, smoking, and, the, damage, it, does, to, health, controlled, levels, of, nicotine, are, given, to, patients, through, gums, dermal, patches, lozenges, inhalers, or, nasal, sprays, to, wean, them, off, their, dependence, a, 2018, cochrane, collaboration, review, found, high, quality, evidence, that, all, current, forms, of, nicotine, replacement, therapy, gum, patch, lozenges, inhaler, and, nasal, spray, increase, the, chances, of, successfully, quitting, smoking, by, 50, 60, regardless, of, setting, combining, nicotine, patch, use, with, a, faster, acting, nicotine, replacement, like, gum, or, spray, improves, the, odds, of, treatment, success, in, contrast, to, recreational, nicotine, products, which, have, been, designed, to, maximize, the, likelihood, of, addiction, nicotine, replacement, products, nrts, are, designed, to, minimize, addictiveness, 112, the, more, quickly, a, dose, of, nicotine, is, delivered, and, absorbed, the, higher, the, addiction, risk, investigative, nicotine, is, being, researched, in, clinical, trials, for, possible, benefit, in, treating, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, and, depression, nicotine, may, partly, attenuate, sensory, gating, and, attentional, deficits, associated, with, schizophrenia, short, term, use, of, nicotine, was, found, to, improve, subjects, reaction, time, and, alertness, in, given, tasks, according, to, research, nicotine, was, not, found, to, improve, negative, positive, or, other, cognitive, symptoms, of, schizophrenia, nicotine, has, been, used, as, an, insecticide, since, at, least, 1690, in, the, form, of, tobacco, extracts, although, other, components, of, tobacco, also, seem, to, have, pesticide, effects, nicotine, pesticides, have, not, been, commercially, available, in, the, us, since, 2014, homemade, pesticides, are, banned, on, organic, crops, and, caution, is, recommended, for, small, gardeners, nicotine, pesticides, have, been, banned, in, the, eu, since, 2009, foods, are, imported, from, countries, in, which, nicotine, pesticides, are, allowed, such, as, china, but, foods, may, not, exceed, maximum, nicotine, levels, neonicotinoids, such, as, imidacloprid, which, are, derived, from, and, structurally, similar, to, nicotine, are, widely, used, as, agricultural, and, veterinary, pesticides, as, of, 2016, nicotine, containing, products, are, sometimes, used, for, the, performance, enhancing, effects, of, nicotine, on, cognition, a, 2010, meta, analysis, of, 41, double, blind, placebo, controlled, studies, concluded, that, nicotine, or, smoking, had, significant, positive, effects, on, aspects, of, fine, motor, abilities, alerting, and, orienting, attention, and, episodic, and, working, memory, a, 2015, review, noted, that, stimulation, of, the, 4, 2, nicotinic, receptor, is, responsible, for, certain, improvements, in, attentional, performance, among, the, nicotinic, receptor, subtypes, nicotine, has, the, highest, binding, affinity, at, the, 4, 2, receptor, k, i, 1, nm, which, is, also, the, biological, target, that, mediates, nicotine, s, addictive, properties, nicotine, has, potential, beneficial, effects, but, it, also, has, paradoxical, effects, which, may, be, due, to, the, inverted, u, shape, of, the, dose, response, curve, or, pharmacokinetic, features, nicotine, is, used, as, a, recreational, drug, it, is, widely, used, highly, addictive, and, hard, to, discontinue, nicotine, is, often, used, compulsively, and, dependence, can, develop, within, days, recreational, drug, users, commonly, use, nicotine, for, its, mood, altering, effects, recreational, nicotine, products, include, chewing, tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, e, cigarettes, snuff, pipe, tobacco, snus, and, nicotine, pouches, alcohol, infused, with, nicotine, is, called, nicotini, nicotine, use, for, tobacco, cessation, has, few, contraindications, it, is, not, known, whether, nicotine, replacement, therapy, is, effective, for, smoking, cessation, in, adolescents, as, of, 2014, it, is, therefore, not, recommended, to, adolescents, it, is, not, safe, to, use, nicotine, during, pregnancy, or, breastfeeding, although, it, is, safer, than, smoking, the, desirability, of, nrt, use, in, pregnancy, is, therefore, debated, randomized, trials, and, observational, studies, of, nicotine, replacement, therapy, in, cardiovascular, patients, show, no, increase, in, adverse, cardiovascular, events, compared, to, those, treated, with, placebo, using, nicotine, products, during, cancer, treatment, may, be, contraindicated, as, nicotine, may, promote, tumour, growth, but, temporary, use, of, nrts, to, quit, smoking, may, be, advised, for, harm, reduction, nicotine, gum, is, contraindicated, in, individuals, with, temporomandibular, joint, disease, people, with, chronic, nasal, disorders, and, severe, reactive, airway, disease, require, additional, precautions, when, using, nicotine, nasal, sprays, nicotine, in, any, form, is, contraindicated, in, individuals, with, a, known, hypersensitivity, to, nicotine, nicotine, is, classified, as, a, poison, however, at, doses, used, by, consumers, it, presents, little, if, any, hazard, to, the, user, a, 2018, cochrane, collaboration, review, lists, nine, main, adverse, events, related, to, nicotine, replacement, therapy, headache, dizziness, light, headedness, nausea, vomiting, gastro, intestinal, symptoms, sleep, dream, problems, non, ischemic, palpitations, and, chest, pain, skin, reactions, oral, nasal, reactions, and, hiccups, many, of, these, were, also, common, in, the, placebo, group, without, nicotine, palpitations, and, chest, pain, were, deemed, rare, and, there, was, no, evidence, of, an, increased, number, of, serious, cardiac, problems, compared, to, the, placebo, group, even, in, people, with, established, cardiac, disease, the, common, side, effects, from, nicotine, exposure, are, listed, in, the, table, below, serious, adverse, events, due, to, the, use, of, nicotine, replacement, therapy, are, extremely, rare, at, low, amounts, it, has, a, mild, analgesic, effect, at, sufficiently, high, doses, nicotine, may, result, in, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, salivation, bradyarrhythmia, and, possibly, seizures, hypoventilation, and, death, nicotine, reduces, the, amount, of, rapid, eye, movement, rem, sleep, slow, wave, sleep, sws, and, total, sleep, time, in, healthy, nonsmokers, given, nicotine, via, a, transdermal, patch, and, the, reduction, is, dose, dependent, acute, nicotine, intoxication, has, been, found, to, significantly, reduce, total, sleep, time, and, increase, rem, latency, sleep, onset, latency, and, non, rapid, eye, movement, nrem, stage, 2, sleep, time, depressive, non, smokers, experience, mood, and, sleep, improvements, under, nicotine, administration, however, subsequent, nicotine, withdrawal, has, a, negative, effect, on, both, mood, and, sleep, a, 2018, cochrane, review, found, that, in, rare, cases, nicotine, replacement, therapy, can, cause, non, ischemic, chest, pain, i, e, chest, pain, that, is, unrelated, to, a, heart, attack, and, heart, palpitations, but, does, not, increase, the, incidence, of, serious, cardiac, adverse, events, i, e, myocardial, infarction, stroke, and, cardiac, death, relative, to, controls, a, 2016, review, of, the, cardiovascular, toxicity, of, nicotine, concluded, based, on, current, knowledge, we, believe, that, the, cardiovascular, risks, of, nicotine, from, e, cigarette, use, in, people, without, cardiovascular, disease, are, quite, low, we, have, concerns, that, nicotine, from, e, cigarettes, could, pose, some, risk, for, users, with, cardiovascular, disease, in, the, short, term, nicotine, causes, a, transient, increase, in, blood, pressure, long, term, epidemiological, studies, generally, show, increased, blood, pressure, and, hypertension, among, nicotine, users, nicotine, is, highly, addictive, but, paradoxically, has, quite, weak, reinforcing, property, compared, to, other, drugs, of, abuse, in, various, animals, its, addictiveness, depends, on, how, it, is, administered, and, also, depends, upon, form, in, which, nicotine, is, used, animal, research, suggests, that, monoamine, oxidase, inhibitors, acetaldehyde, and, other, constituents, in, tobacco, smoke, may, enhance, its, addictiveness, nicotine, dependence, involves, aspects, of, both, psychological, dependence, and, physical, dependence, since, discontinuation, of, extended, use, has, been, shown, to, produce, both, affective, e, g, anxiety, irritability, craving, anhedonia, and, somatic, mild, motor, dysfunctions, such, as, tremor, withdrawal, symptoms, withdrawal, symptoms, peak, in, one, to, three, days, and, can, persist, for, several, weeks, even, though, other, drugs, of, dependence, can, have, withdrawal, states, lasting, 6, months, or, longer, this, does, not, appear, to, occur, with, cigarette, withdrawal, normal, between, cigarettes, discontinuation, in, unrestricted, smokers, causes, mild, but, measurable, nicotine, withdrawal, symptoms, these, include, mildly, worse, mood, stress, anxiety, cognition, and, sleep, all, of, which, briefly, return, to, normal, with, the, next, cigarette, smokers, have, a, worse, mood, than, they, typically, would, have, if, they, were, not, nicotine, dependent, they, experience, normal, moods, only, immediately, after, smoking, nicotine, dependence, is, associated, with, poor, sleep, quality, and, shorter, sleep, duration, among, smokers, in, dependent, smokers, withdrawal, causes, impairments, in, memory, and, attention, and, smoking, during, withdrawal, returns, these, cognitive, abilities, to, pre, withdrawal, levels, the, temporarily, increased, cognitive, levels, of, smokers, after, inhaling, smoke, are, offset, by, periods, of, cognitive, decline, during, nicotine, withdrawal, therefore, the, overall, daily, cognitive, levels, of, smokers, and, non, smokers, are, roughly, similar, nicotine, activates, the, mesolimbic, pathway, and, induces, long, term, fosb, expression, i, e, produces, phosphorylated, fosb, isoforms, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, when, inhaled, or, injected, frequently, or, at, high, doses, but, not, necessarily, when, ingested, consequently, high, daily, exposure, possibly, excluding, oral, route, to, nicotine, can, cause, fosb, overexpression, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, resulting, in, nicotine, addiction, contrary, to, popular, belief, nicotine, itself, does, not, cause, cancer, in, humans, although, it, is, unclear, whether, it, functions, as, a, tumor, promoter, as, of, 2012, a, 2018, report, by, the, us, national, academies, of, sciences, engineering, and, medicine, concludes, hile, it, is, biologically, plausible, that, nicotine, can, act, as, a, tumor, promoter, the, existing, body, of, evidence, indicates, this, is, unlikely, to, translate, into, increased, risk, of, human, cancer, low, levels, of, nicotine, stimulate, cell, proliferation, while, high, levels, are, cytotoxic, nicotine, increases, cholinergic, signaling, and, adrenergic, signaling, in, colon, cancer, cells, thereby, impeding, apoptosis, programmed, cell, death, promoting, tumor, growth, and, activating, growth, factors, and, cellular, mitogenic, factors, such, as, 5, lipoxygenase, 5, lox, and, epidermal, growth, factor, egf, nicotine, also, promotes, cancer, growth, by, stimulating, angiogenesis, and, neovascularization, nicotine, promotes, lung, cancer, development, and, accelerates, its, proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and, epithelial, mesenchymal, transition, emt, via, its, influence, on, nachrs, receptors, whose, presence, has, been, confirmed, in, lung, cancer, cells, in, cancer, cells, nicotine, promotes, the, epithelial, mesenchymal, transition, which, makes, the, cancer, cells, more, resistant, to, drugs, that, treat, cancer, nicotine, in, tobacco, can, form, carcinogenic, tobacco, specific, nitrosamines, through, a, nitrosation, reaction, this, occurs, mostly, in, the, curing, and, processing, of, tobacco, however, nicotine, in, the, mouth, and, stomach, can, react, to, form, n, nitrosonornicotine, a, known, type, 1, carcinogen, suggesting, that, consumption, of, non, tobacco, forms, of, nicotine, may, still, play, a, role, in, carcinogenesis, nicotine, causes, dna, damage, in, several, types, of, human, cells, as, judged, by, assays, for, genotoxicity, such, as, the, comet, assay, cytokinesis, block, micronucleus, test, and, chromosome, aberrations, test, in, humans, this, damage, can, happen, in, primary, parotid, gland, cells, lymphocytes, and, respiratory, tract, cells, nicotine, has, been, shown, to, produce, birth, defects, in, some, animal, species, but, not, others, consequently, it, is, considered, to, be, a, possible, teratogen, in, humans, in, animal, studies, that, resulted, in, birth, defects, researchers, found, that, nicotine, negatively, affects, fetal, brain, development, and, pregnancy, outcomes, the, negative, effects, on, early, brain, development, are, associated, with, abnormalities, in, brain, metabolism, and, neurotransmitter, system, function, nicotine, crosses, the, placenta, and, is, found, in, the, breast, milk, of, mothers, who, smoke, as, well, as, mothers, who, inhale, passive, smoke, nicotine, exposure, in, utero, is, responsible, for, several, complications, of, pregnancy, and, birth, pregnant, women, who, smoke, are, at, greater, risk, for, both, miscarriage, and, stillbirth, and, infants, exposed, to, nicotine, in, utero, tend, to, have, lower, birth, weights, a, mcmaster, university, research, group, observed, in, 2010, that, rats, exposed, to, nicotine, in, the, womb, via, parenteral, infusion, later, in, life, had, conditions, including, type, 2, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral, defects, respiratory, dysfunction, and, infertility, it, is, unlikely, that, a, person, would, overdose, on, nicotine, through, smoking, alone, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, stated, in, 2013, that, there, are, no, significant, safety, concerns, associated, with, the, use, of, more, than, one, form, of, over, the, counter, otc, nicotine, replacement, therapy, at, the, same, time, or, using, otc, nrt, at, the, same, time, as, another, nicotine, containing, product, like, cigarettes, the, median, lethal, dose, of, nicotine, in, humans, is, unknown, nevertheless, nicotine, has, a, relatively, high, toxicity, in, comparison, to, many, other, alkaloids, such, as, caffeine, which, has, an, ld, 50, of, 127, mg, kg, when, administered, to, mice, at, sufficiently, high, doses, it, is, associated, with, nicotine, poisoning, which, while, common, in, children, in, whom, poisonous, and, lethal, levels, occur, at, lower, doses, per, kilogram, of, body, weight, rarely, results, in, significant, morbidity, or, death, the, estimated, lower, dose, limit, for, fatal, outcomes, is, 500, 1, 000, mg, of, ingested, nicotine, for, an, adult, 6, 5, 13, mg, kg, the, initial, symptoms, of, a, nicotine, overdose, typically, include, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypersalivation, abdominal, pain, tachycardia, rapid, heart, rate, hypertension, high, blood, pressure, tachypnea, rapid, breathing, headache, dizziness, pallor, pale, skin, auditory, or, visual, disturbances, and, perspiration, followed, shortly, after, by, marked, bradycardia, slow, heart, rate, bradypnea, slow, breathing, and, hypotension, low, blood, pressure, an, increased, respiratory, rate, i, e, tachypnea, is, one, of, the, primary, signs, of, nicotine, poisoning, at, sufficiently, high, doses, somnolence, sleepiness, or, drowsiness, confusion, syncope, loss, of, consciousness, from, fainting, shortness, of, breath, marked, weakness, seizures, and, coma, may, occur, lethal, nicotine, poisoning, rapidly, produces, seizures, and, death, which, may, occur, within, minutes, is, believed, to, be, due, to, respiratory, paralysis, today, nicotine, is, less, commonly, used, in, agricultural, insecticides, which, was, a, main, source, of, poisoning, more, recent, cases, of, poisoning, typically, appear, to, be, in, the, form, of, green, tobacco, sickness, gts, accidental, ingestion, of, tobacco, or, tobacco, products, or, ingestion, of, nicotine, containing, plants, people, who, harvest, or, cultivate, tobacco, may, experience, gts, a, type, of, nicotine, poisoning, caused, by, dermal, exposure, to, wet, tobacco, leaves, this, occurs, most, commonly, in, young, inexperienced, tobacco, harvesters, who, do, not, consume, tobacco, people, can, be, exposed, to, nicotine, in, the, workplace, by, breathing, it, in, skin, absorption, swallowing, it, or, eye, contact, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, the, legal, limit, permissible, exposure, limit, for, nicotine, exposure, in, the, workplace, as, 0, 5, mg, m, 3, skin, exposure, over, an, 8, hour, workday, the, us, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, 0, 5, mg, m, 3, skin, exposure, over, an, 8, hour, workday, at, environmental, levels, of, 5, mg, m, 3, nicotine, is, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, nicotine, and, cigarette, smoke, both, induce, the, expression, of, liver, enzymes, e, g, certain, cytochrome, p450, proteins, which, metabolize, drugs, leading, to, the, potential, for, alterations, in, drug, metabolism, nicotine, acts, as, a, receptor, agonist, at, most, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptors, nachrs, except, at, two, nicotinic, receptor, subunits, nachr, 9, and, nachr, 10, where, it, acts, as, a, receptor, antagonist, such, antagonism, results, in, mild, analgesia, by, binding, to, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptors, in, the, brain, nicotine, elicits, its, psychoactive, effects, and, increases, the, levels, of, several, neurotransmitters, in, various, brain, structures, acting, as, a, sort, of, volume, control, nicotine, has, a, higher, affinity, for, nicotinic, receptors, in, the, brain, than, those, in, skeletal, muscle, though, at, toxic, doses, it, can, induce, contractions, and, respiratory, paralysis, nicotine, s, selectivity, is, thought, to, be, due, to, a, particular, amino, acid, difference, on, these, receptor, subtypes, nicotine, is, unusual, in, comparison, to, most, drugs, as, its, profile, changes, from, stimulant, to, sedative, with, increasing, dosages, a, phenomenon, known, as, nesbitt, s, paradox, after, the, doctor, who, first, described, it, in, 1969, at, very, high, doses, it, dampens, neuronal, activity, nicotine, induces, both, behavioral, stimulation, and, anxiety, in, animals, research, into, nicotine, s, most, predominant, metabolite, cotinine, suggests, that, some, of, nicotine, s, psychoactive, effects, are, mediated, by, cotinine, nicotine, activates, nicotinic, receptors, particularly, 4, 2, nicotinic, receptors, but, also, 5, nachrs, on, neurons, that, innervate, the, ventral, tegmental, area, and, within, the, mesolimbic, pathway, where, it, appears, to, cause, the, release, of, dopamine, this, nicotine, induced, dopamine, release, occurs, at, least, partially, through, activation, of, the, cholinergic, dopaminergic, reward, link, in, the, ventral, tegmental, area, nicotine, can, modulate, the, firing, rate, of, the, ventral, tegmental, area, neurons, these, actions, are, largely, responsible, for, the, strongly, reinforcing, effects, of, nicotine, which, often, occur, in, the, absence, of, euphoria, however, mild, euphoria, from, nicotine, use, can, occur, in, some, individuals, chronic, nicotine, use, inhibits, class, i, and, ii, histone, deacetylases, in, the, striatum, where, this, effect, plays, a, role, in, nicotine, addiction, nicotine, also, activates, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, acting, via, splanchnic, nerves, to, the, adrenal, medulla, stimulating, the, release, of, epinephrine, acetylcholine, released, by, preganglionic, sympathetic, fibers, of, these, nerves, acts, on, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptors, causing, the, release, of, epinephrine, and, norepinephrine, into, the, bloodstream, by, binding, to, ganglion, type, nicotinic, receptors, in, the, adrenal, medulla, nicotine, increases, flow, of, adrenaline, epinephrine, a, stimulating, hormone, and, neurotransmitter, by, binding, to, the, receptors, it, causes, cell, depolarization, and, an, influx, of, calcium, through, voltage, gated, calcium, channels, calcium, triggers, the, exocytosis, of, chromaffin, granules, and, thus, the, release, of, epinephrine, and, norepinephrine, into, the, bloodstream, the, release, of, epinephrine, adrenaline, causes, an, increase, in, heart, rate, blood, pressure, and, respiration, as, well, as, higher, blood, glucose, levels, as, nicotine, enters, the, body, it, is, distributed, quickly, through, the, bloodstream, and, crosses, the, blood, brain, barrier, reaching, the, brain, within, 10, 20, seconds, after, inhalation, the, elimination, half, life, of, nicotine, in, the, body, is, around, two, hours, nicotine, is, primarily, excreted, in, urine, and, urinary, concentrations, vary, depending, upon, urine, flow, rate, and, urine, ph, the, amount, of, nicotine, absorbed, by, the, body, from, smoking, can, depend, on, many, factors, including, the, types, of, tobacco, whether, the, smoke, is, inhaled, and, whether, a, filter, is, used, however, it, has, been, found, that, the, nicotine, yield, of, individual, products, has, only, a, small, effect, 4, 4, on, the, blood, concentration, of, nicotine, suggesting, the, assumed, health, advantage, of, switching, to, lower, tar, and, lower, nicotine, cigarettes, may, be, largely, offset, by, the, tendency, of, smokers, to, compensate, by, increasing, inhalation, nicotine, has, a, half, life, of, 1, 2, hours, cotinine, is, an, active, metabolite, of, nicotine, that, remains, in, the, blood, with, a, half, life, of, 18, 20, hours, making, it, easier, to, analyze, nicotine, is, metabolized, in, the, liver, by, cytochrome, p450, enzymes, mostly, cyp2a6, and, also, by, cyp2b6, and, fmo3, which, selectively, metabolizes, s, nicotine, a, major, metabolite, is, cotinine, other, primary, metabolites, include, nicotine, n, oxide, nornicotine, nicotine, isomethonium, ion, 2, hydroxynicotine, and, nicotine, glucuronide, under, some, conditions, other, substances, may, be, formed, such, as, myosmine, glucuronidation, and, oxidative, metabolism, of, nicotine, to, cotinine, are, both, inhibited, by, menthol, an, additive, to, mentholated, cigarettes, thus, increasing, the, half, life, of, nicotine, in, vivo, nicotine, decreases, hunger, and, as, a, consequence, food, consumption, alongside, increasing, energy, expenditure, the, majority, of, research, shows, that, nicotine, reduces, body, weight, but, some, researchers, have, found, that, nicotine, may, result, in, weight, gain, under, specific, types, of, eating, habits, in, animal, models, nicotine, effect, on, weight, appears, to, result, from, nicotine, s, stimulation, of, 3, 4, nachr, receptors, located, in, the, pomc, neurons, in, the, arcuate, nucleus, and, subsequently, the, melanocortin, system, especially, the, melanocortin, 4, receptors, on, second, order, neurons, in, the, paraventricular, nucleus, of, the, hypothalamus, thus, modulating, feeding, inhibition, pomc, neurons, are, a, precursor, of, the, melanocortin, system, a, critical, regulator, of, body, weight, and, peripheral, tissue, such, as, skin, and, hair, nicotine, is, a, hygroscopic, colorless, to, yellow, brown, oily, liquid, that, is, readily, soluble, in, alcohol, ether, or, light, petroleum, it, is, miscible, with, water, in, its, neutral, amine, base, form, between, 60, c, and, 210, c, it, is, a, dibasic, nitrogenous, base, having, k, b1, 1, 10, 6, k, b2, 1, 10, 11, it, readily, forms, ammonium, salts, with, acids, that, are, usually, solid, and, water, soluble, its, flash, point, is, 95, c, and, its, auto, ignition, temperature, is, 244, c, nicotine, is, readily, volatile, vapor, pressure, 5, 5, pa, at, 25, c, on, exposure, to, ultraviolet, light, or, various, oxidizing, agents, nicotine, is, converted, to, nicotine, oxide, nicotinic, acid, niacin, vitamin, b3, and, methylamine, nicotine, is, chiral, and, hence, optically, active, having, two, enantiomeric, forms, the, naturally, occurring, form, of, nicotine, is, levorotatory, with, a, specific, rotation, of, d, 166, 4, nicotine, the, dextrorotatory, form, nicotine, is, physiologically, less, active, than, nicotine, nicotine, is, more, toxic, than, nicotine, the, salts, of, nicotine, are, usually, dextrorotatory, this, conversion, between, levorotatory, and, dextrorotatory, upon, protonation, is, common, among, alkaloids, the, hydrochloride, and, sulfate, salts, become, optically, inactive, if, heated, in, a, closed, vessel, above, 180, c, anabasine, is, a, structural, isomer, of, nicotine, as, both, compounds, have, the, molecular, formula, c, 10, h, 14, n, 2, nicotine, that, is, found, in, natural, tobacco, is, primarily, 99, the, s, enantiomer, conversely, the, most, common, chemistry, synthetic, methods, for, generating, nicotine, yields, a, product, that, is, approximately, equal, proportions, of, the, s, and, r, enantiomers, this, suggests, that, tobacco, derived, and, synthetic, nicotine, can, be, determined, by, measuring, the, ratio, of, the, two, different, enantiomers, although, means, exist, for, adjusting, the, relative, levels, of, the, enantiomers, or, performing, a, synthesis, that, only, leads, to, the, s, enantiomer, there, is, limited, data, on, the, relative, physiological, effects, of, these, two, enantiomers, especially, in, people, however, the, studies, to, date, indicate, that, s, nicotine, is, more, potent, than, r, nicotine, and, s, nicotine, causes, stronger, sensations, or, irritation, than, r, nicotine, studies, have, not, been, adequate, to, determine, the, relative, addictiveness, of, the, two, enantiomers, in, people, pod, mod, electronic, cigarettes, use, nicotine, in, the, form, of, a, protonated, nicotine, rather, than, free, base, nicotine, found, in, earlier, generations, the, first, laboratory, preparation, of, nicotine, as, its, racemate, was, described, in, 1904, the, starting, material, was, an, n, substituted, pyrrole, derivative, which, was, heated, to, convert, it, by, a, sigmatropic, shift, to, the, isomer, with, a, carbon, bond, between, the, pyrrole, and, pyridine, rings, followed, by, methylation, and, selective, reduction, of, the, pyrrole, ring, using, tin, and, hydrochloric, acid, many, other, syntheses, of, nicotine, in, both, racemic, and, chiral, forms, have, since, been, published, the, biosynthetic, pathway, of, nicotine, involves, a, coupling, reaction, between, the, two, cyclic, structures, that, comprise, nicotine, metabolic, studies, show, that, the, pyridine, ring, of, nicotine, is, derived, from, niacin, nicotinic, acid, while, the, pyrrolidine, is, derived, from, n, methyl, 1, pyrrollidium, cation, biosynthesis, of, the, two, component, structures, proceeds, via, two, independent, syntheses, the, nad, pathway, for, niacin, and, the, tropane, pathway, for, n, methyl, 1, pyrrollidium, cation, the, nad, pathway, in, the, genus, nicotiana, begins, with, the, oxidation, of, aspartic, acid, into, amino, succinate, by, aspartate, oxidase, ao, this, is, followed, by, a, condensation, with, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, and, a, cyclization, catalyzed, by, quinolinate, synthase, qs, to, give, quinolinic, acid, quinolinic, acid, then, reacts, with, phosphoribosyl, pyrophosphate, catalyzed, by, quinolinic, acid, phosphoribosyl, transferase, qpt, to, form, niacin, mononucleotide, namn, the, reaction, now, proceeds, via, the, nad, salvage, cycle, to, produce, niacin, via, the, conversion, of, nicotinamide, by, the, enzyme, nicotinamidase, the, n, methyl, 1, pyrrollidium, cation, used, in, the, synthesis, of, nicotine, is, an, intermediate, in, the, synthesis, of, tropane, derived, alkaloids, biosynthesis, begins, with, decarboxylation, of, ornithine, by, ornithine, decarboxylase, odc, to, produce, putrescine, putrescine, is, then, converted, into, n, methyl, putrescine, via, methylation, by, sam, catalyzed, by, putrescine, n, methyltransferase, pmt, n, methyl, putrescine, then, undergoes, deamination, into, 4, methylaminobutanal, by, the, n, methyl, putrescine, oxidase, mpo, enzyme, 4, methylaminobutanal, then, spontaneously, cyclize, into, n, methyl, 1, pyrrollidium, cation, the, final, step, in, the, synthesis, of, nicotine, is, the, coupling, between, n, methyl, 1, pyrrollidium, cation, and, niacin, although, studies, conclude, some, form, of, coupling, between, the, two, component, structures, the, definite, process, and, mechanism, remains, undetermined, the, current, agreed, theory, involves, the, conversion, of, niacin, into, 2, 5, dihydropyridine, through, 3, 6, dihydronicotinic, acid, the, 2, 5, dihydropyridine, intermediate, would, then, react, with, n, methyl, 1, pyrrollidium, cation, to, form, enantiomerically, pure, nicotine, nicotine, can, be, quantified, in, blood, plasma, or, urine, to, confirm, a, diagnosis, of, poisoning, or, to, facilitate, a, medicolegal, death, investigation, urinary, or, salivary, cotinine, concentrations, are, frequently, measured, for, the, purposes, of, pre, employment, and, health, insurance, medical, screening, programs, careful, interpretation, of, results, is, important, since, passive, exposure, to, cigarette, smoke, can, result, in, significant, accumulation, of, nicotine, followed, by, the, appearance, of, its, metabolites, in, various, body, fluids, nicotine, use, is, not, regulated, in, competitive, sports, programs, methods, for, measuring, the, two, enantiomers, are, straightforward, and, include, normal, phase, liquid, chromatography, liquid, chromatography, with, a, chiral, column, however, since, methods, can, be, used, to, alter, the, two, enantiomers, it, may, not, be, possible, to, distinguish, tobacco, derived, from, synthetic, nicotine, simply, by, measuring, the, levels, of, the, two, enantiomers, a, new, approach, uses, hydrogen, and, deuterium, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, to, distinguish, tobacco, derived, and, synthetic, nicotine, based, on, differences, the, substrates, used, in, the, natural, synthetic, pathway, performed, in, the, tobacco, plant, and, the, substrates, most, used, in, synthesis, another, approach, measures, the, carbon, 14, content, which, also, differs, between, natural, and, laboratory, based, tobacco, these, methods, remain, to, be, fully, evaluated, and, validated, using, a, wide, range, of, samples, nicotine, is, a, secondary, metabolite, produced, in, a, variety, of, plants, in, the, family, solanaceae, most, notably, in, tobacco, nicotiana, tabacum, where, it, can, be, found, at, high, concentrations, of, 0, 5, to, 7, 5, nicotine, is, also, found, in, the, leaves, of, other, tobacco, species, such, as, nicotiana, rustica, in, amounts, of, 2, 14, nicotine, production, is, strongly, induced, in, response, to, wounding, as, part, of, a, jasmonate, dependent, reaction, specialist, insects, on, tobacco, such, as, the, tobacco, hornworm, manduca, sexta, have, a, number, of, adaptations, to, the, detoxification, and, even, adaptive, re, purposing, of, nicotine, nicotine, is, also, found, at, low, concentrations, in, the, nectar, of, tobacco, plants, where, it, may, promote, outcrossing, by, affecting, the, behavior, of, hummingbird, pollinators, nicotine, occurs, in, smaller, amounts, varying, from, 2, 7, g, kg, or, 20, 70, millionths, of, a, percent, wet, weight, in, other, solanaceaeous, plants, including, some, crop, species, such, as, potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, and, peppers, as, well, as, non, crop, species, such, as, duboisia, hopwoodii, the, amounts, of, nicotine, in, tomatoes, lowers, substantially, as, the, fruit, ripens, a, 1999, report, found, in, some, papers, it, is, suggested, that, the, contribution, of, dietary, nicotine, intake, is, significant, when, compared, with, exposure, to, ets, or, by, active, smoking, of, small, numbers, of, cigarettes, others, consider, the, dietary, intake, to, be, negligible, unless, inordinately, large, amounts, of, specific, vegetables, are, consumed, the, amount, of, nicotine, eaten, per, day, is, roughly, around, 1, 4, and, 2, 25, g, day, at, the, 95th, percentile, these, numbers, may, be, low, due, to, insufficient, food, intake, data, the, concentrations, of, nicotine, in, vegetables, are, difficult, to, measure, accurately, since, they, are, very, low, parts, per, billion, range, nicotine, was, originally, isolated, from, the, tobacco, plant, in, 1828, by, chemists, wilhelm, heinrich, posselt, and, karl, ludwig, reimann, from, germany, who, believed, it, was, a, poison, its, chemical, empirical, formula, was, described, by, melsens, in, 1843, its, structure, was, discovered, by, adolf, pinner, and, richard, wolffenstein, in, 1893, and, it, was, first, synthesized, by, am, pictet, and, a, rotschy, in, 1904, nicotine, is, named, after, the, tobacco, plant, nicotiana, tabacum, which, in, turn, is, named, after, the, french, ambassador, in, portugal, jean, nicot, de, villemain, who, sent, tobacco, and, seeds, to, paris, in, 1560, presented, to, the, french, king, and, who, promoted, their, medicinal, use, smoking, was, believed, to, protect, against, illness, particularly, the, plague, tobacco, was, introduced, to, europe, in, 1559, and, by, the, late, 17th, century, it, was, used, not, only, for, smoking, but, also, as, an, insecticide, after, world, war, ii, over, 2, 500, tons, of, nicotine, insecticide, were, used, worldwide, but, by, the, 1980s, the, use, of, nicotine, insecticide, had, declined, below, 200, tons, this, was, due, to, the, availability, of, other, insecticides, that, are, cheaper, and, less, harmful, to, mammals, the, nicotine, content, of, popular, american, brand, cigarettes, has, increased, over, time, and, one, study, found, that, there, was, an, average, increase, of, 1, 78, per, year, between, the, years, of, 1998, and, 2005, although, methods, of, production, of, synthetic, nicotine, have, existed, for, decades, it, was, believed, that, the, cost, of, making, nicotine, by, laboratory, synthesis, was, cost, prohibitive, compared, to, extracting, nicotine, from, tobacco, however, recently, synthetic, nicotine, started, to, be, found, in, different, brands, of, e, cigarettes, and, oral, pouches, and, marketed, as, tobacco, free, the, us, fda, is, tasked, with, reviewing, tobacco, products, such, as, e, cigarettes, and, determining, which, can, be, authorized, for, sale, in, response, to, the, likelihood, that, fda, would, not, authorize, many, e, cigarettes, to, be, marketed, e, cigarette, companies, began, marketing, products, that, they, claimed, to, contain, nicotine, that, were, not, made, or, derived, from, tobacco, but, contained, synthetic, nicotine, instead, and, thus, would, be, outside, fda, s, tobacco, regulatory, authority, similarly, nicotine, pouches, that, claimed, to, contain, non, tobacco, synthetic, nicotine, were, also, introduced, the, cost, of, synthetic, nicotine, has, decreased, as, the, market, for, the, product, increased, in, march, 2022, the, u, s, congress, passed, a, law, the, consolidated, appropriations, act, 2022, that, expanded, fda, s, tobacco, regulatory, authority, to, include, tobacco, products, containing, nicotine, from, any, source, thereby, including, products, made, with, synthetic, nicotine, in, the, united, states, nicotine, products, and, nicotine, replacement, therapy, products, like, nicotrol, are, only, available, to, people, 18, and, above, proof, of, age, is, required, not, for, sale, in, vending, machine, or, from, any, source, where, proof, of, age, cannot, be, verified, as, of, 2019, the, minimum, age, to, purchase, tobacco, in, the, us, is, 21, at, the, federal, level, in, the, european, union, the, minimum, age, to, purchase, nicotine, products, is, 18, however, there, is, no, minimum, age, requirement, to, use, tobacco, or, nicotine, products, in, the, united, kingdom, the, tobacco, and, related, products, regulations, 2016, implemented, the, european, directive, 2014, 40, eu, amended, by, tobacco, products, and, nicotine, inhaling, products, amendment, etc, eu, exit, regulations, 2019, and, the, tobacco, products, and, nicotine, inhaling, products, amendment, eu, exit, regulations, 2020, additionally, other, regulations, limit, advertising, sale, and, display, of, tobacco, products, and, other, products, containing, nicotine, for, human, consumption, the, sunak, government, has, proposed, banning, disposable, vapes, to, limit, the, appeal, and, affordability, for, children, in, some, anti, smoking, literature, the, harm, that, tobacco, smoking, and, nicotine, addiction, does, is, personified, as, nick, o, teen, represented, as, a, humanoid, with, some, aspect, of, a, cigarette, or, cigarette, butt, about, him, or, his, clothes, and, hat, nick, o, teen, was, a, villain, that, was, created, for, the, health, education, council, the, character, was, featured, in, three, animated, anti, smoking, public, service, announcements, in, which, he, tries, to, get, kids, addicted, to, cigarettes, before, being, foiled, by, the, dc, comics, character, superman, nicotine, was, often, compared, to, caffeine, in, advertisements, in, the, 1980s, by, the, tobacco, industry, and, later, in, the, 2010s, by, the, electronic, cigarettes, industry, in, an, effort, to, reduce, the, stigmatization, and, the, public, perception, of, the, risks, associated, with, nicotine, use, while, acute, initial, nicotine, intake, causes, activation, of, neuronal, nicotine, receptors, chronic, low, doses, of, nicotine, use, leads, to, desensitization, of, those, receptors, due, to, the, development, of, tolerance, and, results, in, an, antidepressant, effect, with, early, research, showing, low, dose, nicotine, patches, could, be, an, effective, treatment, of, major, depressive, disorder, in, non, smokers, though, tobacco, smoking, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, alzheimer, s, disease, there, is, evidence, that, nicotine, itself, has, the, potential, to, prevent, and, treat, alzheimer, s, disease, smoking, is, associated, with, a, decreased, risk, of, parkinson, s, disease, however, it, is, unknown, whether, this, is, due, to, people, with, healthier, brain, dopaminergic, reward, centers, the, area, of, the, brain, affected, by, parkinson, s, being, more, likely, to, enjoy, smoking, and, thus, pick, up, the, habit, nicotine, directly, acting, as, a, neuroprotective, agent, or, other, compounds, in, cigarette, smoke, acting, as, neuroprotective, agents, immune, cells, of, both, the, innate, immune, system, and, adaptive, immune, systems, frequently, express, the, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, and, 10, subunits, of, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptors, evidence, suggests, that, nicotinic, receptors, which, contain, these, subunits, are, involved, in, the, regulation, of, immune, function, a, photoactivatable, form, of, nicotine, which, releases, nicotine, when, exposed, to, ultraviolet, light, with, certain, conditions, has, been, developed, for, studying, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptors, in, brain, tissue, several, in, vitro, studies, have, investigated, the, potential, effects, of, nicotine, on, a, range, of, oral, cells, a, recent, systematic, review, concluded, that, nicotine, was, unlikely, to, be, cytotoxic, to, oral, cells, in, vitro, in, most, physiological, conditions, but, further, research, is, needed, understanding, the, potential, role, of, nicotine, in, oral, health, has, become, increasingly, important, given, the, recent, introduction, of, novel, nicotine, products, and, their, potential, role, in, helping, smokers, quit
