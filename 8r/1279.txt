the, gastrointestinal, tract, gi, tract, digestive, tract, alimentary, canal, is, the, tract, or, passageway, of, the, digestive, system, that, leads, from, the, mouth, to, the, anus, the, gi, tract, contains, all, the, major, organs, of, the, digestive, system, in, humans, and, other, animals, including, the, esophagus, stomach, and, intestines, food, taken, in, through, the, mouth, is, digested, to, extract, nutrients, and, absorb, energy, and, the, waste, expelled, at, the, anus, as, faeces, gastrointestinal, is, an, adjective, meaning, of, or, pertaining, to, the, stomach, and, intestines, most, animals, have, a, through, gut, or, complete, digestive, tract, exceptions, are, more, primitive, ones, sponges, have, small, pores, ostia, throughout, their, body, for, digestion, and, a, larger, dorsal, pore, osculum, for, excretion, comb, jellies, have, both, a, ventral, mouth, and, dorsal, anal, pores, while, cnidarians, and, acoels, have, a, single, pore, for, both, digestion, and, excretion, the, human, gastrointestinal, tract, consists, of, the, esophagus, stomach, and, intestines, and, is, divided, into, the, upper, and, lower, gastrointestinal, tracts, the, gi, tract, includes, all, structures, between, the, mouth, and, the, anus, forming, a, continuous, passageway, that, includes, the, main, organs, of, digestion, namely, the, stomach, small, intestine, and, large, intestine, the, complete, human, digestive, system, is, made, up, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, plus, the, accessory, organs, of, digestion, the, tongue, salivary, glands, pancreas, liver, and, gallbladder, the, tract, may, also, be, divided, into, foregut, midgut, and, hindgut, reflecting, the, embryological, origin, of, each, segment, the, whole, human, gi, tract, is, about, nine, meters, 30, feet, long, at, autopsy, it, is, considerably, shorter, in, the, living, body, because, the, intestines, which, are, tubes, of, smooth, muscle, tissue, maintain, constant, muscle, tone, in, a, halfway, tense, state, but, can, relax, in, spots, to, allow, for, local, distention, and, peristalsis, the, gastrointestinal, tract, contains, the, gut, microbiota, with, some, 1, 000, different, strains, of, bacteria, having, diverse, roles, in, the, maintenance, of, immune, health, and, metabolism, and, many, other, microorganisms, cells, of, the, gi, tract, release, hormones, to, help, regulate, the, digestive, process, these, digestive, hormones, including, gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin, and, ghrelin, are, mediated, through, either, intracrine, or, autocrine, mechanisms, indicating, that, the, cells, releasing, these, hormones, are, conserved, structures, throughout, evolution, the, structure, and, function, can, be, described, both, as, gross, anatomy, and, as, microscopic, anatomy, or, histology, the, tract, itself, is, divided, into, upper, and, lower, tracts, and, the, intestines, small, and, large, parts, the, upper, gastrointestinal, tract, consists, of, the, mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, and, duodenum, the, exact, demarcation, between, the, upper, and, lower, tracts, is, the, suspensory, muscle, of, the, duodenum, this, differentiates, the, embryonic, borders, between, the, foregut, and, midgut, and, is, also, the, division, commonly, used, by, clinicians, to, describe, gastrointestinal, bleeding, as, being, of, either, upper, or, lower, origin, upon, dissection, the, duodenum, may, appear, to, be, a, unified, organ, but, it, is, divided, into, four, segments, based, on, function, location, and, internal, anatomy, the, four, segments, of, the, duodenum, are, as, follows, starting, at, the, stomach, and, moving, toward, the, jejunum, bulb, descending, horizontal, and, ascending, the, suspensory, muscle, attaches, the, superior, border, of, the, ascending, duodenum, to, the, jejunum, the, suspensory, muscle, is, an, important, anatomical, landmark, that, shows, the, formal, division, between, the, duodenum, and, the, jejunum, the, first, and, second, parts, of, the, small, intestine, respectively, this, is, a, thin, muscle, which, is, derived, from, the, embryonic, mesoderm, the, lower, gastrointestinal, tract, includes, most, of, the, small, intestine, and, all, of, the, large, intestine, in, human, anatomy, the, intestine, bowel, or, gut, greek, ntera, is, the, segment, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, extending, from, the, pyloric, sphincter, of, the, stomach, to, the, anus, and, as, in, other, mammals, consists, of, two, segments, the, small, intestine, and, the, large, intestine, in, humans, the, small, intestine, is, further, subdivided, into, the, duodenum, jejunum, and, ileum, while, the, large, intestine, is, subdivided, into, the, cecum, ascending, transverse, descending, and, sigmoid, colon, rectum, and, anal, canal, the, small, intestine, begins, at, the, duodenum, and, is, a, tubular, structure, usually, between, 6, and, 7, m, long, its, mucosal, area, in, an, adult, human, is, about, 30, m, 2, 320, sq, ft, the, combination, of, the, circular, folds, the, villi, and, the, microvilli, increases, the, absorptive, area, of, the, mucosa, about, 600, fold, making, a, total, area, of, about, 250, m, 2, 2, 700, sq, ft, for, the, entire, small, intestine, its, main, function, is, to, absorb, the, products, of, digestion, including, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and, vitamins, into, the, bloodstream, there, are, three, major, divisions, the, large, intestine, also, called, the, colon, forms, an, arch, starting, at, the, cecum, and, ending, at, the, rectum, and, anal, canal, it, also, includes, the, appendix, which, is, attached, to, the, cecum, its, length, is, about, 1, 5, m, and, the, area, of, the, mucosa, in, an, adult, human, is, about, 2, m, 2, 22, sq, ft, its, main, function, is, to, absorb, water, and, salts, the, colon, is, further, divided, into, the, gut, is, an, endoderm, derived, structure, at, approximately, the, sixteenth, day, of, human, development, the, embryo, begins, to, fold, ventrally, with, the, embryo, s, ventral, surface, becoming, concave, in, two, directions, the, sides, of, the, embryo, fold, in, on, each, other, and, the, head, and, tail, fold, toward, one, another, the, result, is, that, a, piece, of, the, yolk, sac, an, endoderm, lined, structure, in, contact, with, the, ventral, aspect, of, the, embryo, begins, to, be, pinched, off, to, become, the, primitive, gut, the, yolk, sac, remains, connected, to, the, gut, tube, via, the, vitelline, duct, usually, this, structure, regresses, during, development, in, cases, where, it, does, not, it, is, known, as, meckel, s, diverticulum, during, fetal, life, the, primitive, gut, is, gradually, patterned, into, three, segments, foregut, midgut, and, hindgut, although, these, terms, are, often, used, in, reference, to, segments, of, the, primitive, gut, they, are, also, used, regularly, to, describe, regions, of, the, definitive, gut, as, well, each, segment, of, the, gut, is, further, specified, and, gives, rise, to, specific, gut, and, gut, related, structures, in, later, development, components, derived, from, the, gut, proper, including, the, stomach, and, colon, develop, as, swellings, or, dilatations, in, the, cells, of, the, primitive, gut, in, contrast, gut, related, derivatives, that, is, those, structures, that, derive, from, the, primitive, gut, but, are, not, part, of, the, gut, proper, in, general, develop, as, out, pouchings, of, the, primitive, gut, the, blood, vessels, supplying, these, structures, remain, constant, throughout, development, the, gastrointestinal, tract, has, a, form, of, general, histology, with, some, differences, that, reflect, the, specialization, in, functional, anatomy, the, gi, tract, can, be, divided, into, four, concentric, layers, in, the, following, order, the, mucosa, is, the, innermost, layer, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, the, mucosa, surrounds, the, lumen, or, open, space, within, the, tube, this, layer, comes, in, direct, contact, with, digested, food, chyme, the, mucosa, is, made, up, of, the, mucosae, are, highly, specialized, in, each, organ, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, to, deal, with, the, different, conditions, the, most, variation, is, seen, in, the, epithelium, the, submucosa, consists, of, a, dense, irregular, layer, of, connective, tissue, with, large, blood, vessels, lymphatics, and, nerves, branching, into, the, mucosa, and, muscularis, externa, it, contains, the, submucosal, plexus, an, enteric, nervous, plexus, situated, on, the, inner, surface, of, the, muscularis, externa, the, muscular, layer, consists, of, an, inner, circular, layer, and, a, longitudinal, outer, layer, the, circular, layer, prevents, food, from, traveling, backward, and, the, longitudinal, layer, shortens, the, tract, the, layers, are, not, truly, longitudinal, or, circular, rather, the, layers, of, muscle, are, helical, with, different, pitches, the, inner, circular, is, helical, with, a, steep, pitch, and, the, outer, longitudinal, is, helical, with, a, much, shallower, pitch, whilst, the, muscularis, externa, is, similar, throughout, the, entire, gastrointestinal, tract, an, exception, is, the, stomach, which, has, an, additional, inner, oblique, muscular, layer, to, aid, with, grinding, and, mixing, of, food, the, muscularis, externa, of, the, stomach, is, composed, of, the, inner, oblique, layer, middle, circular, layer, and, the, outer, longitudinal, layer, between, the, circular, and, longitudinal, muscle, layers, is, the, myenteric, plexus, this, controls, peristalsis, activity, is, initiated, by, the, pacemaker, cells, myenteric, interstitial, cells, of, cajal, the, gut, has, intrinsic, peristaltic, activity, basal, electrical, rhythm, due, to, its, self, contained, enteric, nervous, system, the, rate, can, be, modulated, by, the, rest, of, the, autonomic, nervous, system, the, coordinated, contractions, of, these, layers, is, called, peristalsis, and, propels, the, food, through, the, tract, food, in, the, gi, tract, is, called, a, bolus, ball, of, food, from, the, mouth, down, to, the, stomach, after, the, stomach, the, food, is, partially, digested, and, semi, liquid, and, is, referred, to, as, chyme, in, the, large, intestine, the, remaining, semi, solid, substance, is, referred, to, as, faeces, the, outermost, layer, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, consists, of, several, layers, of, connective, tissue, intraperitoneal, parts, of, the, gi, tract, are, covered, with, serosa, these, include, most, of, the, stomach, first, part, of, the, duodenum, all, of, the, small, intestine, caecum, and, appendix, transverse, colon, sigmoid, colon, and, rectum, in, these, sections, of, the, gut, there, is, a, clear, boundary, between, the, gut, and, the, surrounding, tissue, these, parts, of, the, tract, have, a, mesentery, retroperitoneal, parts, are, covered, with, adventitia, they, blend, into, the, surrounding, tissue, and, are, fixed, in, position, for, example, the, retroperitoneal, section, of, the, duodenum, usually, passes, through, the, transpyloric, plane, these, include, the, esophagus, pylorus, of, the, stomach, distal, duodenum, ascending, colon, descending, colon, and, anal, canal, in, addition, the, oral, cavity, has, adventitia, approximately, 20, 000, protein, coding, genes, are, expressed, in, human, cells, and, 75, of, these, genes, are, expressed, in, at, least, one, of, the, different, parts, of, the, digestive, organ, system, over, 600, of, these, genes, are, more, specifically, expressed, in, one, or, more, parts, of, the, gi, tract, and, the, corresponding, proteins, have, functions, related, to, digestion, of, food, and, uptake, of, nutrients, examples, of, specific, proteins, with, such, functions, are, pepsinogen, pgc, and, the, lipase, lipf, expressed, in, chief, cells, and, gastric, atpase, atp4a, and, gastric, intrinsic, factor, gif, expressed, in, parietal, cells, of, the, stomach, mucosa, specific, proteins, expressed, in, the, stomach, and, duodenum, involved, in, defence, include, mucin, proteins, such, as, mucin, 6, and, intelectin, 1, the, time, taken, for, food, to, transit, through, the, gastrointestinal, tract, varies, on, multiple, factors, including, age, ethnicity, and, gender, several, techniques, have, been, used, to, measure, transit, time, including, radiography, following, a, barium, labeled, meal, breath, hydrogen, analysis, scintigraphic, analysis, following, a, radiolabeled, meal, and, simple, ingestion, and, spotting, of, corn, kernels, it, takes, 2, 5, to, 3, hours, for, 50, of, the, contents, to, leave, the, stomach, the, rate, of, digestion, is, also, dependent, of, the, material, being, digested, as, food, composition, from, the, same, meal, may, leave, the, stomach, at, different, rates, total, emptying, of, the, stomach, takes, around, 4, 5, hours, and, transit, through, the, colon, takes, 30, to, 50, hours, the, gastrointestinal, tract, forms, an, important, part, of, the, immune, system, the, surface, area, of, the, digestive, tract, is, estimated, to, be, about, 32, square, meters, or, about, half, a, badminton, court, with, such, a, large, exposure, more, than, three, times, larger, than, the, exposed, surface, of, the, skin, these, immune, components, function, to, prevent, pathogens, from, entering, the, blood, and, lymph, circulatory, systems, fundamental, components, of, this, protection, are, provided, by, the, intestinal, mucosal, barrier, which, is, composed, of, physical, biochemical, and, immune, elements, elaborated, by, the, intestinal, mucosa, microorganisms, also, are, kept, at, bay, by, an, extensive, immune, system, comprising, the, gut, associated, lymphoid, tissue, galt, there, are, additional, factors, contributing, to, protection, from, pathogen, invasion, for, example, low, ph, ranging, from, 1, to, 4, of, the, stomach, is, fatal, for, many, microorganisms, that, enter, it, similarly, mucus, containing, iga, antibodies, neutralizes, many, pathogenic, microorganisms, other, factors, in, the, gi, tract, contribution, to, immune, function, include, enzymes, secreted, in, the, saliva, and, bile, beneficial, bacteria, also, can, contribute, to, the, homeostasis, of, the, gastrointestinal, immune, system, for, example, clostridia, one, of, the, most, predominant, bacterial, groups, in, the, gi, tract, play, an, important, role, in, influencing, the, dynamics, of, the, gut, s, immune, system, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, the, intake, of, a, high, fiber, diet, could, be, responsible, for, the, induction, of, t, regulatory, cells, tregs, this, is, due, to, the, production, of, short, chain, fatty, acids, during, the, fermentation, of, plant, derived, nutrients, such, as, butyrate, and, propionate, basically, the, butyrate, induces, the, differentiation, of, treg, cells, by, enhancing, histone, h3, acetylation, in, the, promoter, and, conserved, non, coding, sequence, regions, of, the, foxp3, locus, thus, regulating, the, t, cells, resulting, in, the, reduction, of, the, inflammatory, response, and, allergies, the, large, intestine, contains, multiple, types, of, bacteria, that, can, break, down, molecules, the, human, body, cannot, process, alone, demonstrating, a, symbiotic, relationship, these, bacteria, are, responsible, for, gas, production, at, host, pathogen, interface, which, is, released, as, flatulence, however, the, primary, function, of, the, large, intestine, is, water, absorption, from, digested, material, regulated, by, the, hypothalamus, and, the, reabsorption, of, sodium, and, nutrients, beneficial, intestinal, bacteria, compete, with, potentially, harmful, bacteria, for, space, and, food, as, the, intestinal, tract, has, limited, resources, a, ratio, of, 80, 85, beneficial, to, 15, 20, potentially, harmful, bacteria, is, proposed, for, maintaining, homeostasis, an, imbalanced, ratio, results, in, dysbiosis, enzymes, such, as, cyp3a4, along, with, the, antiporter, activities, are, also, instrumental, in, the, intestine, s, role, of, drug, metabolism, in, the, detoxification, of, antigens, and, xenobiotics, in, most, vertebrates, including, fishes, amphibians, birds, reptiles, and, egg, laying, mammals, the, gastrointestinal, tract, ends, in, a, cloaca, and, not, an, anus, in, the, cloaca, the, urinary, system, is, fused, with, the, genito, anal, pore, therians, all, mammals, that, do, not, lay, eggs, including, humans, possess, separate, anal, and, uro, genital, openings, the, females, of, the, subgroup, placentalia, have, even, separate, urinary, and, genital, openings, during, early, development, the, asymmetric, position, of, the, bowels, and, inner, organs, is, initiated, see, also, axial, twist, theory, ruminants, show, many, specializations, for, digesting, and, fermenting, tough, plant, material, consisting, of, additional, stomach, compartments, many, birds, and, other, animals, have, a, specialised, stomach, in, the, digestive, tract, called, a, gizzard, used, for, grinding, up, food, another, feature, found, in, a, range, of, animals, is, the, crop, in, birds, this, is, found, as, a, pouch, alongside, the, esophagus, in, 2020, the, oldest, known, fossil, digestive, tract, of, an, extinct, wormlike, organism, in, the, cloudinidae, was, discovered, it, lived, during, the, late, ediacaran, period, about, 550, million, years, ago, a, through, gut, one, with, both, mouth, and, anus, is, thought, to, have, evolved, within, the, nephrozoan, clade, of, bilateria, after, their, ancestral, ventral, orifice, single, as, in, cnidarians, and, acoels, re, evolved, in, nephrozoans, like, flatworms, stretched, antero, posteriorly, before, the, middle, part, of, the, stretch, would, get, narrower, and, closed, fully, leaving, an, anterior, orifice, mouth, and, a, posterior, orifice, anus, plus, genital, opening, a, stretched, gut, without, the, middle, part, closed, is, present, in, another, branch, of, bilaterians, the, extinct, proarticulates, this, and, the, amphistomic, development, when, both, mouth, and, anus, develop, from, the, gut, stretch, in, the, embryo, present, in, some, nephrozoans, e, g, roundworms, are, considered, to, support, this, hypothesis, there, are, many, diseases, and, conditions, that, can, affect, the, gastrointestinal, system, including, infections, inflammation, and, cancer, various, pathogens, such, as, bacteria, that, cause, foodborne, illnesses, can, induce, gastroenteritis, which, results, from, inflammation, of, the, stomach, and, small, intestine, antibiotics, to, treat, such, bacterial, infections, can, decrease, the, microbiome, diversity, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, and, further, enable, inflammatory, mediators, gastroenteritis, is, the, most, common, disease, of, the, gi, tract, diverticular, disease, is, a, condition, that, is, very, common, in, older, people, in, industrialized, countries, it, usually, affects, the, large, intestine, but, has, been, known, to, affect, the, small, intestine, as, well, diverticulosis, occurs, when, pouches, form, on, the, intestinal, wall, once, the, pouches, become, inflamed, it, is, known, as, diverticulitis, inflammatory, bowel, disease, is, an, inflammatory, condition, affecting, the, bowel, walls, and, includes, the, subtypes, crohn, s, disease, and, ulcerative, colitis, while, crohn, s, can, affect, the, entire, gastrointestinal, tract, ulcerative, colitis, is, limited, to, the, large, intestine, crohn, s, disease, is, widely, regarded, as, an, autoimmune, disease, although, ulcerative, colitis, is, often, treated, as, though, it, were, an, autoimmune, disease, there, is, no, consensus, that, it, actually, is, such, functional, gastrointestinal, disorders, the, most, common, of, which, is, irritable, bowel, syndrome, functional, constipation, and, chronic, functional, abdominal, pain, are, other, functional, disorders, of, the, intestine, that, have, physiological, causes, but, do, not, have, identifiable, structural, chemical, or, infectious, pathologies, several, symptoms, can, indicate, problems, with, the, gastrointestinal, tract, including, gastrointestinal, surgery, can, often, be, performed, in, the, outpatient, setting, in, the, united, states, in, 2012, operations, on, the, digestive, system, accounted, for, 3, of, the, 25, most, common, ambulatory, surgery, procedures, and, constituted, 9, 1, percent, of, all, outpatient, ambulatory, surgeries, various, methods, of, imaging, the, gastrointestinal, tract, include, the, upper, and, lower, gastrointestinal, series, intestines, from, animals, other, than, humans, are, used, in, a, number, of, ways, from, each, species, of, livestock, that, is, a, source, of, milk, a, corresponding, rennet, is, obtained, from, the, intestines, of, milk, fed, calves, pig, and, calf, intestines, are, eaten, and, pig, intestines, are, used, as, sausage, casings, calf, intestines, supply, calf, intestinal, alkaline, phosphatase, cip, and, are, used, to, make, goldbeater, s, skin, other, uses, are
