the, koala, phascolarctos, cinereus, sometimes, called, the, koala, bear, is, an, arboreal, herbivorous, marsupial, native, to, australia, it, is, the, only, extant, representative, of, the, family, phascolarctidae, its, closest, living, relatives, are, the, wombats, the, koala, is, found, in, coastal, areas, of, the, island, s, eastern, and, southern, regions, inhabiting, queensland, new, south, wales, victoria, and, south, australia, it, is, easily, recognisable, by, its, stout, tailless, body, and, large, head, with, round, fluffy, ears, and, large, dark, nose, the, koala, has, a, body, length, of, 60, 85, cm, 24, 33, in, and, weighs, 4, 15, kg, 8, 8, 33, 1, lb, fur, colour, ranges, from, silver, grey, to, chocolate, brown, koalas, from, the, northern, populations, are, typically, smaller, and, lighter, in, colour, than, their, counterparts, further, south, these, populations, possibly, are, separate, subspecies, but, this, is, disputed, koalas, typically, inhabit, open, eucalyptus, woodland, as, the, leaves, of, these, trees, make, up, most, of, their, diet, this, eucalypt, diet, has, low, nutritional, and, caloric, content, and, contains, toxic, compounds, that, deter, most, other, mammals, from, feeding, on, it, koalas, are, largely, sedentary, and, sleep, up, to, twenty, hours, a, day, they, are, asocial, only, mothers, bond, to, dependent, offspring, adult, males, communicate, with, bellows, that, intimidate, rivals, and, attract, mates, males, mark, their, presence, with, secretions, from, scent, glands, located, on, their, chests, like, other, marsupials, koalas, give, birth, to, young, known, as, joeys, at, a, very, early, stage, of, development, they, crawl, into, their, mothers, pouches, where, they, live, for, their, first, six, to, seven, months, they, are, fully, weaned, around, a, year, old, koalas, have, few, natural, predators, and, parasites, but, are, threatened, by, pathogens, such, as, chlamydiaceae, bacteria, and, koala, retrovirus, because, of, their, distinctive, appearance, koalas, along, with, kangaroos, and, emus, are, recognised, worldwide, as, symbols, of, australia, they, were, hunted, by, indigenous, australians, and, depicted, in, myths, and, cave, art, for, millennia, the, first, recorded, encounter, between, a, european, and, a, koala, was, in, 1798, and, an, image, of, the, animal, was, published, in, 1810, by, naturalist, george, perry, botanist, robert, brown, wrote, the, first, detailed, scientific, description, in, 1814, although, his, work, remained, unpublished, for, 180, years, artist, john, gould, illustrated, and, described, the, koala, introducing, the, species, to, the, british, public, further, details, about, the, animal, s, biology, were, revealed, in, the, 19th, century, by, english, scientists, koalas, are, listed, as, a, vulnerable, species, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, among, the, many, threats, to, their, existence, are, habitat, destruction, caused, by, agriculture, urbanisation, droughts, and, associated, bushfires, some, related, to, climate, change, in, february, 2022, the, koala, was, officially, listed, as, endangered, in, the, australian, capital, territory, new, south, wales, and, queensland, the, word, koala, comes, from, the, dharug, gula, meaning, no, water, although, the, vowel, u, was, originally, written, in, the, english, orthography, as, oo, in, spellings, such, as, coola, or, koolah, two, syllables, the, spelling, later, became, oa, and, the, word, is, now, pronounced, in, three, syllables, possibly, in, error, adopted, by, white, settlers, koala, became, one, of, hundreds, of, aboriginal, loan, words, in, australian, english, where, it, was, also, commonly, referred, to, as, native, bear, later, koala, bear, for, its, resemblance, to, a, bear, it, is, one, of, several, aboriginal, words, that, made, it, into, international, english, alongside, words, like, didgeridoo, and, kangaroo, the, generic, name, phascolarctos, is, derived, from, the, greek, words, phaskolos, pouch, and, arktos, bear, the, specific, name, cinereus, is, latin, for, ash, coloured, the, koala, was, given, its, generic, name, phascolarctos, in, 1816, by, french, zoologist, henri, marie, ducrotay, de, blainville, who, did, not, give, it, a, specific, name, until, further, review, in, 1819, german, zoologist, georg, august, goldfuss, gave, it, the, binomial, lipurus, cinereus, because, phascolarctos, was, published, first, according, to, the, international, code, of, zoological, nomenclature, it, has, priority, as, the, official, genus, name, 58, 59, french, naturalist, anselme, ga, tan, desmarest, coined, the, name, phascolarctos, fuscus, in, 1820, suggesting, that, the, brown, coloured, versions, were, a, different, species, than, the, grey, ones, other, names, suggested, by, european, authors, included, marodactylus, cinereus, by, goldfuss, in, 1820, p, flindersii, by, ren, primev, re, lesson, in, 1827, and, p, koala, by, john, edward, gray, in, 1827, 45, the, koala, is, classified, with, wombats, family, vombatidae, and, several, extinct, families, including, marsupial, tapirs, marsupial, lions, and, giant, wombats, in, the, suborder, vombatiformes, within, the, order, diprotodontia, the, vombatiformes, are, a, sister, group, to, a, clade, that, includes, macropods, kangaroos, and, wallabies, and, possums, the, koala, s, lineage, possibly, branched, off, around, 40, million, years, ago, during, the, eocene, the, modern, koala, is, the, only, extant, member, of, phascolarctidae, a, family, that, includes, several, extinct, genera, and, species, during, the, oligocene, and, miocene, koalas, lived, in, rainforests, and, had, broader, diets, some, species, such, as, nimiokoala, greystanesi, and, some, species, of, perikoala, were, around, the, same, size, as, the, modern, koala, while, others, such, as, species, of, litokoala, were, one, half, to, two, thirds, its, size, like, the, modern, species, prehistoric, koalas, had, well, developed, ear, structures, which, suggests, that, they, also, made, long, distance, vocalisations, and, had, a, relatively, inactive, lifestyle, during, the, miocene, the, australian, continent, began, drying, out, leading, to, the, decline, of, rainforests, and, the, spread, of, open, eucalyptus, woodlands, the, genus, phascolarctos, split, from, litokoala, in, the, late, miocene, and, had, several, adaptations, that, allowed, it, to, live, on, a, eucalyptus, diet, the, palate, shifted, towards, the, front, of, the, skull, the, upper, teeth, were, lined, by, thicker, bone, molars, became, relatively, low, compared, to, the, jaw, joint, and, with, more, chewing, surface, the, pterygoid, fossa, shrank, and, a, larger, gap, separated, the, incisor, teeth, and, the, molars, 226, p, cinereus, may, have, emerged, as, a, dwarf, form, of, the, giant, koala, p, stirtoni, following, the, disappearance, of, several, giant, animals, in, the, late, pleistocene, a, 2008, study, questioned, this, hypothesis, noting, that, p, cinereus, and, p, stirtoni, were, sympatric, during, the, mid, late, pleistocene, and, that, their, teeth, morphology, displayed, the, major, differences, the, fossil, record, of, the, modern, koala, extends, back, at, least, to, the, middle, pleistocene, vombatidae, wombats, phascolarctidae, koalas, acrobatidae, tarsipedidae, honey, possum, petauridae, wrist, winged, gliders, and, allies, pseudocheiridae, ringtail, possums, and, allies, macropodidae, kangaroos, wallabies, and, allies, phalangeridae, brushtail, possums, and, cuscuses, burramyidae, pygmy, possums, thylacoleonidae, extinct, marsupial, lion, and, allies, vombatomorphia, wombats, and, fossil, relatives, priscakoala, lucyturnbullae, madakoala, spp, perikoala, robustus, nimiokoala, greystanesi, litokoala, dicksmithi, litokoala, kutjamarpensis, phascolarctos, cinereus, three, subspecies, are, recognised, the, queensland, koala, phascolarctos, cinereus, adustus, thomas, 1923, the, new, south, wales, koala, phascolarctos, cinereus, cinereus, goldfuss, 1817, and, the, victorian, koala, phascolarctos, cinereus, victor, troughton, 1935, these, forms, are, distinguished, by, pelage, colour, and, thickness, body, size, and, skull, shape, the, queensland, koala, is, the, smallest, with, silver, or, grey, short, hairs, and, a, shorter, skull, the, victorian, koala, is, the, largest, with, shaggier, brown, fur, and, a, wider, skull, 7, the, geographic, limits, of, these, variations, are, based, on, state, borders, and, their, status, as, subspecies, is, disputed, a, 1999, genetic, study, suggests, koalas, exist, as, a, cline, within, a, single, evolutionarily, significant, unit, with, limited, gene, flow, between, local, populations, other, studies, have, found, that, koala, populations, are, highly, inbred, with, low, genetic, variation, such, low, genetic, diversity, may, have, been, caused, by, population, declines, during, the, late, pleistocene, rivers, and, roads, limit, gene, flow, and, contribute, to, the, isolation, of, southeast, queensland, populations, in, april, 2013, scientists, from, the, australian, museum, and, queensland, university, of, technology, announced, they, had, fully, sequenced, the, koala, genome, the, koala, is, a, robust, animal, with, a, large, head, and, vestigial, or, non, existent, tail, 1, it, has, a, body, length, of, 60, 85, cm, 24, 33, in, and, a, weight, of, 4, 15, kg, 8, 8, 33, 1, lb, making, it, among, the, largest, arboreal, marsupials, koalas, from, victoria, are, twice, as, heavy, as, those, from, queensland, 7, the, species, is, sexually, dimorphic, males, are, 50, larger, than, females, males, noses, are, more, curved, and, sport, chest, glands, which, are, visible, as, bald, patches, 55, the, female, s, pouch, opening, is, secured, by, a, sphincter, which, holds, the, young, in, the, pelage, of, the, koala, is, denser, on, the, back, back, fur, colour, varies, from, light, grey, to, chocolate, brown, 1, 2, the, belly, fur, is, whitish, on, the, rump, it, is, mottled, whitish, and, dark, the, koala, has, the, most, effective, insulating, back, fur, of, any, marsupial, and, is, resilient, to, wind, and, rain, while, the, belly, fur, can, reflect, solar, radiation, the, koala, has, curved, sharp, claws, well, adapted, for, climbing, trees, the, large, forepaws, have, two, opposable, digits, the, first, and, second, which, are, opposable, to, the, other, three, that, allow, them, to, grip, small, branches, on, the, hind, paws, the, second, and, third, digits, are, fused, a, typical, condition, for, members, of, the, diprotodontia, and, the, attached, claws, which, are, still, separate, function, like, a, comb, 5, the, animal, has, a, robust, skeleton, and, a, short, muscular, upper, body, with, relatively, long, upper, limbs, that, contribute, to, its, ability, to, climb, the, thigh, muscles, are, anchored, further, down, the, shinbone, increasing, its, climbing, power, 183, for, a, mammal, the, koala, has, a, disproportionately, small, brain, 81, 60, smaller, than, that, of, a, typical, diprotodont, weighing, only, 19, 2, g, 0, 68, oz, on, average, the, brain, s, surface, is, fairly, smooth, and, primitive, 52, it, does, not, entirely, fill, the, cranial, cavity, unlike, most, mammals, 81, and, is, lightened, by, large, amounts, of, cerebrospinal, fluid, it, is, possible, that, the, fluid, protects, the, brain, should, the, animal, fall, from, a, tree, 52, 53, the, koala, s, small, brain, may, be, an, adaptation, to, the, energy, restrictions, imposed, by, its, diet, which, is, insufficient, to, sustain, a, larger, brain, 81, its, small, brain, limits, its, ability, to, perform, complex, behaviours, for, example, it, will, not, eat, plucked, eucalyptus, leaves, on, a, flat, surface, which, does, not, match, its, feeding, routine, 234, the, koala, has, a, broad, dark, nose, with, a, good, sense, of, smell, and, it, is, known, to, sniff, the, oils, of, individual, branchlets, to, assess, their, edibility, 81, its, relatively, small, eyes, are, unusual, among, marsupials, in, that, the, pupils, have, vertical, slits, an, adaptation, to, living, on, a, more, vertical, plane, its, round, ears, provide, it, with, good, hearing, 6, and, it, has, a, well, developed, middle, ear, the, koala, larynx, is, located, relatively, low, in, the, vocal, tract, and, can, be, pulled, further, down, they, possess, unique, folds, in, the, velum, soft, palate, known, as, velar, vocal, folds, in, addition, to, the, typical, vocal, folds, of, the, larynx, these, features, allow, the, koala, to, produce, deeper, sounds, than, would, otherwise, be, possible, for, their, size, the, koala, has, several, adaptations, for, its, low, nutrient, toxic, and, fibrous, diet, 76, the, animal, s, dentition, consists, of, incisors, and, cheek, teeth, a, single, premolar, and, four, molars, on, each, jaw, that, are, separated, by, a, large, gap, a, characteristic, feature, of, herbivorous, mammals, the, koala, bites, a, leaf, with, the, incisors, and, clips, it, with, the, premolars, at, the, petiole, before, chewing, it, to, pieces, with, the, cusped, molars, 46, koalas, may, store, food, in, their, cheek, pouches, before, it, is, ready, to, be, chewed, the, partially, worn, molars, of, koalas, in, their, prime, are, optimal, for, breaking, leaves, into, small, particles, resulting, in, more, efficient, stomach, digestion, and, nutrient, absorption, in, the, small, intestine, 231, which, digests, the, eucalyptus, leaves, to, provide, most, of, the, animal, s, energy, 47, a, koala, sometimes, regurgitates, the, food, into, the, mouth, to, be, chewed, a, second, time, koalas, are, hindgut, fermenters, and, their, digestive, retention, can, last, 100, hours, in, the, wild, or, 200, hours, in, captivity, 48, this, is, made, possible, by, their, caecum, 200, cm, 79, in, long, and, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, in, diameter, possibly, the, largest, for, an, animal, of, its, size, 188, koalas, can, retain, food, particles, for, longer, fermentation, if, needed, they, are, more, likely, keep, smaller, particles, as, larger, ones, take, longer, to, digest, 48, while, the, hindgut, is, relatively, large, only, 10, of, the, animal, s, energy, is, obtained, from, digestion, in, this, chamber, the, koala, s, metabolic, rate, is, only, 50, of, the, typical, mammalian, rate, owing, to, its, low, energy, intake, 77, 78, although, this, can, vary, across, seasons, and, sexes, 49, they, can, digest, the, toxic, plant, secondary, metabolites, phenolic, compounds, and, terpenes, due, to, their, production, of, cytochrome, p450, which, neutralises, these, poisons, in, the, liver, the, koala, replaces, lost, water, at, a, lower, rate, than, species, such, as, some, possums, 231, it, maintains, water, by, absorbing, it, in, the, caecum, resulting, in, drier, faecal, pellets, packed, with, undigested, fibre, 231, 188, the, koala, s, range, covers, roughly, 1, 000, 000, km, 2, 390, 000, sq, mi, and, 30, ecoregions, it, ranges, throughout, mainland, eastern, and, southeastern, australia, including, the, states, of, queensland, new, south, wales, victoria, and, south, australia, the, koala, was, introduced, to, several, nearby, islands, the, population, on, magnetic, island, represents, the, northern, limit, of, its, range, fossil, evidence, shows, that, the, koala, s, range, stretched, as, far, west, as, southwestern, western, australia, during, the, late, pleistocene, they, were, likely, driven, to, extinction, in, these, areas, by, environmental, changes, and, hunting, by, indigenous, australians, 12, 13, koalas, were, introduced, to, western, australia, at, yanchep, in, 1938, but, that, population, was, reduced, to, 4, individuals, by, 2022, koalas, can, be, found, in, both, tropical, and, temperate, habitats, ranging, from, dense, woodlands, to, more, spaced, out, forests, in, semi, arid, climates, they, prefer, riparian, habitats, where, nearby, streams, and, creeks, provide, refuge, during, times, of, drought, and, extreme, heat, koalas, are, herbivorous, and, while, most, of, their, diet, consists, of, eucalypt, leaves, they, can, be, found, in, trees, of, other, genera, such, as, acacia, allocasuarina, callitris, leptospermum, and, melaleuca, 73, though, the, foliage, of, over, 600, species, of, eucalyptus, is, available, the, koala, shows, a, strong, preference, for, around, 30, they, prefer, plant, matter, with, higher, protein, than, fibre, and, lignin, 231, the, most, favoured, species, are, eucalyptus, microcorys, e, tereticornis, and, e, camaldulensis, which, on, average, make, up, more, than, 20, of, their, diet, despite, its, reputation, as, a, picky, eater, the, koala, is, more, generalist, than, some, other, marsupial, species, such, as, the, greater, glider, the, koala, does, not, need, to, drink, often, as, it, can, get, enough, water, from, the, leaves, 73, 74, though, larger, males, may, additionally, drink, water, found, on, the, ground, or, in, tree, hollows, 231, when, feeding, a, koala, reaches, out, to, grab, leaves, with, one, forepaw, while, the, other, paws, hang, on, to, the, branch, depending, on, the, size, of, the, individual, a, koala, can, walk, to, the, end, of, a, branch, or, must, stay, near, the, base, 96, each, day, koalas, eat, up, to, 400, grams, 14, oz, of, leaves, spread, over, four, to, six, feeding, periods, 187, despite, their, adaptations, to, a, low, energy, lifestyle, they, have, meagre, fat, reserves, 189, their, low, energy, diet, limits, their, activity, and, they, sleep, 20, hours, a, day, 93, they, are, predominantly, active, at, night, and, spend, most, of, their, waking, hours, foraging, they, typically, eat, and, sleep, in, the, same, tree, possibly, for, as, long, as, a, day, 39, on, warm, days, a, koala, may, rest, with, its, back, against, a, branch, or, lie, down, with, its, limbs, dangling, 93, 94, when, it, gets, hot, the, koala, rests, lower, in, the, canopy, and, near, the, trunk, where, the, surface, is, cooler, than, the, surrounding, air, it, curls, up, when, it, gets, cold, and, wet, 39, it, resorts, to, a, lower, thicker, branch, during, high, winds, while, it, spends, most, of, the, time, in, the, tree, the, animal, descends, to, the, ground, to, move, to, another, tree, with, either, a, walking, or, leaping, gait, 93, 94, the, koala, usually, grooms, itself, with, its, hind, paws, with, their, double, claws, but, sometimes, uses, its, forepaws, or, mouth, 97, 98, koalas, are, asocial, and, spend, just, 15, minutes, a, day, on, social, behaviours, in, areas, of, higher, density, and, fewer, trees, home, ranges, are, smaller, and, more, clumped, 98, koala, society, appears, to, consist, of, residents, and, transients, the, former, are, mostly, adult, females, and, the, latter, are, males, resident, males, appear, to, be, territorial, and, dominant, the, territories, of, dominant, males, are, found, near, breeding, females, while, younger, males, must, wait, until, they, reach, full, size, to, challenge, for, breeding, rights, 191, adult, males, occasionally, venture, outside, their, home, ranges, when, they, do, dominant, ones, retain, their, status, 99, as, a, male, climbs, a, new, tree, he, rubs, his, chest, against, it, and, sometimes, dribbles, urine, this, scent, marking, behaviour, probably, serves, as, communication, and, individuals, are, known, to, sniff, the, bottom, of, a, newly, found, tree, 54, 56, chest, gland, secretions, are, complex, chemical, mixtures, about, 40, compounds, were, identified, in, one, analysis, that, vary, in, composition, and, concentration, across, season, and, age, adult, males, communicate, with, loud, bellows, a, long, series, of, deep, snoring, inhalations, and, belching, exhalations, because, of, their, low, frequency, these, bellows, can, travel, far, through, the, forest, 56, koalas, may, bellow, at, any, time, particularly, during, the, breeding, season, when, it, serves, to, attract, females, and, possibly, intimidate, other, males, they, also, bellow, to, advertise, their, presence, when, they, change, trees, 57, these, sounds, signal, and, exaggerate, the, male, s, body, size, females, pay, more, attention, to, bellows, by, larger, males, female, koalas, bellow, though, more, softly, in, addition, to, making, snarls, wails, and, screams, these, calls, are, produced, when, in, distress, and, when, making, defensive, threats, younger, animals, squeak, and, older, ones, squawk, when, distraught, when, another, individual, climbs, over, it, a, koala, makes, a, low, closed, mouth, grunt, 102, 03, koalas, also, communicate, with, facial, expressions, when, snarling, wailing, or, squawking, the, animal, curls, the, upper, lip, and, points, its, ears, forward, screaming, koalas, pull, their, lips, and, ears, back, females, form, an, oval, shape, with, their, lips, when, annoyed, 104, 05, agonistic, behaviour, typically, consists, of, quarrels, between, individuals, who, are, trying, to, pass, each, other, on, a, tree, this, occasionally, involves, biting, strangers, may, wrestle, chase, and, bite, 102, in, extreme, situations, a, larger, male, may, try, to, displace, a, smaller, rival, from, a, tree, chasing, cornering, and, biting, it, once, the, individual, is, driven, away, the, victor, bellows, and, marks, the, tree, 101, 02, pregnant, and, lactating, females, are, particularly, aggressive, and, attack, individuals, who, come, too, close, in, general, however, koalas, tend, to, avoid, fighting, due, to, energy, costs, 191, koalas, are, seasonal, breeders, and, give, birth, from, october, to, may, females, in, oestrus, lean, their, heads, back, and, shake, their, bodies, despite, these, obvious, signals, males, try, to, copulate, with, any, female, during, this, period, mounting, them, from, behind, because, of, his, much, larger, size, a, male, can, overpower, a, female, a, female, may, scream, and, vigorously, fight, off, her, suitors, but, will, accede, to, one, that, is, dominant, or, familiar, the, commotion, can, attract, other, males, to, the, scene, obliging, the, incumbent, to, delay, mating, and, fight, off, the, intruders, a, female, may, learn, who, is, more, dominant, during, these, fights, 58, 60, older, males, typically, accumulate, scratches, scars, and, cuts, on, the, exposed, parts, of, their, noses, and, their, eyelids, 192, koalas, are, induced, ovulators, the, gestation, period, lasts, 33, 35, days, and, a, female, gives, birth, to, one, joey, or, occasionally, twins, the, young, are, born, tiny, and, barely, formed, weighing, no, more, than, 0, 5, g, 0, 018, oz, however, their, lips, forelimbs, and, shoulders, are, relatively, advanced, and, they, can, breathe, defecate, and, urinate, the, joey, crawls, into, its, mother, s, pouch, to, continue, its, development, 61, female, koalas, do, not, clean, their, pouches, an, unusual, trait, among, marsupials, 181, the, joey, latches, on, to, one, of, the, female, s, two, teats, and, suckles, it, 61, the, female, lactates, for, as, long, as, a, year, to, make, up, for, her, low, energy, production, unlike, in, other, marsupials, koala, milk, becomes, less, fatty, as, the, joey, grows, 62, after, seven, weeks, the, joey, has, a, proportionally, large, head, clear, edges, around, its, face, more, colouration, and, a, visible, pouch, if, female, or, scrotum, male, at, 13, weeks, the, joey, weighs, around, 50, g, 1, 8, oz, and, its, head, doubles, in, size, the, eyes, begin, to, open, and, hair, begins, to, appear, at, 26, weeks, the, fully, furred, animal, resembles, an, adult, and, can, look, outside, the, pouch, 63, at, six, or, seven, months, the, joey, weighs, 300, 500, g, 11, 18, oz, and, fully, emerges, from, the, pouch, for, the, first, time, it, explores, its, new, surroundings, cautiously, clutching, its, mother, for, support, 65, around, this, time, the, mother, prepares, it, for, a, eucalyptus, diet, by, producing, a, faecal, pap, that, the, joey, eats, from,

2, 2, lb, having, permanently, left, the, pouch, it, rides, on, its, mother, s, back, for, transportation, learning, to, climb, by, grasping, branches, 65, 66, gradually, it, becomes, more, independent, the, mother, becomes, pregnant, again, after, a, year, when, the, offspring, reaches, around, 2, 5, kg, 5, 5, lb, she, permanently, severs, her, bond, with, her, previous, offspring, and, no, longer, allows, it, to, suckle, but, it, remains, nearby, until, it, is, one, and, a, half, to, two, years, old, 66, 67, females, become, sexually, mature, at, about, three, years, of, age, in, comparison, males, reach, sexual, maturity, at, about, age, four, although, they, can, experience, spermatogenesis, as, early, as, two, years, 68, males, do, not, start, marking, their, scent, until, they, reach, sexual, maturity, though, their, chest, glands, become, functional, much, earlier, koalas, can, breed, every, year, if, environmental, conditions, are, good, though, the, long, dependence, of, the, young, usually, leads, to, year, long, gaps, in, births, 236, koalas, live, from, 13, to, 18, years, in, the, wild, although, males, may, die, sooner, because, of, their, more, risky, lives, 69, koalas, usually, survive, falls, from, trees, but, they, can, get, hurt, and, even, die, particularly, inexperienced, young, and, fighting, males, 72, 73, around, age, six, the, koala, s, chewing, teeth, begin, to, wear, down, and, their, chewing, efficiency, decreases, eventually, the, cusps, disappear, completely, and, the, animal, dies, of, starvation, koalas, have, few, predators, dingos, and, large, pythons, and, some, birds, of, prey, may, take, them, koalas, are, generally, not, subject, to, external, parasites, other, than, ticks, around, the, coast, the, mite, sarcoptes, scabiei, gives, koalas, mange, while, the, bacterium, mycobacterium, ulcerans, skin, ulcers, but, these, are, uncommon, internal, parasites, are, few, and, have, little, effect, 71, 74, these, include, the, bertiella, obesa, tapeworm, commonly, found, in, the, intestine, and, the, marsupostrongylus, longilarvatus, and, durikainema, phascolarcti, nematodes, which, are, infrequently, found, in, the, lungs, in, a, three, year, study, of, almost, 600, koalas, taken, to, the, australia, zoo, wildlife, hospital, in, queensland, 73, 8, of, the, animals, were, infected, with, parasitic, protozoal, genus, trypanosoma, the, most, frequent, of, which, was, t, irwini, koalas, can, be, subject, to, pathogens, such, as, chlamydiaceae, bacteria, 74, 75, which, can, cause, keratoconjunctivitis, urinary, tract, infection, and, reproductive, tract, infection, 229, 30, such, infections, are, common, on, the, mainland, but, absent, in, some, island, populations, 114, the, koala, retrovirus, korv, may, cause, koala, immune, deficiency, syndrome, kids, which, is, similar, to, aids, in, humans, prevalence, of, korv, in, koala, populations, suggests, it, spread, from, north, to, south, as, only, southern, populations, have, virus, free, individuals, the, animals, are, vulnerable, to, bushfires, due, to, their, slow, speed, and, the, flammability, of, eucalypt, trees, 26, the, koala, instinctively, seeks, refuge, in, the, higher, branches, where, it, is, vulnerable, to, heat, and, fire, bushfires, divide, the, animal, s, habitat, which, isolates, them, decreases, their, numbers, and, creates, genetic, bottlenecks, 209, 11, dehydration, and, overheating, can, prove, fatal, 80, consequently, the, koala, is, vulnerable, to, the, effects, of, climate, change, models, of, climate, change, predict, warmer, and, drier, climates, suggesting, that, the, koala, s, range, will, shrink, in, the, east, and, south, to, more, mesic, habitats, the, first, written, reference, to, the, koala, was, recorded, by, john, price, servant, of, john, hunter, the, governor, of, new, south, wales, price, encountered, the, cullawine, on, 26, january, 1798, during, an, expedition, to, the, blue, mountains, but, his, remarks, would, first, be, published, in, historical, records, of, australia, nearly, a, century, later, 8, in, 1802, french, born, explorer, francis, louis, barrallier, encountered, the, animal, when, his, two, aboriginal, guides, returning, from, a, hunt, brought, back, two, koala, feet, they, were, intending, to, eat, barrallier, preserved, the, appendages, and, sent, them, and, his, notes, to, hunter, s, successor, philip, gidley, king, who, forwarded, them, to, joseph, banks, similar, to, price, barrallier, s, notes, were, not, published, until, 1897, 9, 10, reports, of, the, koolah, appeared, in, the, sydney, gazette, in, late, 1803, and, helped, provide, the, impetus, for, king, to, send, artist, john, lewin, to, create, watercolours, of, the, animal, lewin, painted, three, pictures, one, of, which, was, printe, d, in, georges, cuvier, s, le, r, gne, animal, the, animal, kingdom, 1827, 12, 13, botanist, robert, brown, was, the, first, to, write, a, formal, scientific, description, in, 1803, based, on, a, female, specimen, captured, near, what, is, now, mount, kembla, in, the, illawarra, region, of, new, south, wales, austrian, botanical, illustrator, ferdinand, bauer, drew, the, animal, s, skull, throat, feet, and, paws, brown, s, work, remained, unpublished, and, largely, unnoticed, however, his, field, books, and, notes, remained, in, his, possession, until, his, death, when, they, were, bequeathed, to, the, british, museum, in, london, they, were, not, identified, until, 1994, while, bauer, s, koala, watercolours, were, not, published, until, 1989, 16, 28, william, paterson, who, had, befriended, brown, and, bauer, during, their, stay, in, new, south, wales, wrote, an, eyewitness, report, of, his, encounters, with, the, animals, and, this, would, be, the, basis, for, british, surgeon, everard, home, s, anatomical, writings, on, them, 33, 36, home, who, in, 1808, published, his, report, coined, the, scientific, name, didelphis, coola, 36, george, perry, officially, published, the, first, image, of, the, koala, in, his, 1810, natural, history, work, arcana, 37, perry, called, it, the, new, holland, sloth, and, his, dislike, for, the, koala, evident, in, his, description, of, the, animal, was, reflected, in, the, contemporary, british, attitudes, towards, australian, animals, as, strange, and, primitive, 40, the, eye, is, placed, like, that, of, the, sloth, very, close, to, the, mouth, and, nose, which, gives, it, a, clumsy, awkward, appearance, and, void, of, elegance, in, the, combination, they, have, little, either, in, their, character, or, appearance, to, interest, the, naturalist, or, philosopher, as, nature, however, provides, nothing, in, vain, we, may, suppose, that, even, these, torpid, senseless, creatures, are, wisely, intended, to, fill, up, one, of, the, great, links, of, the, chain, of, animated, nature, naturalist, and, popular, artist, john, gould, illustrated, and, described, the, koala, in, his, three, volume, work, the, mammals, of, australia, 1845, 1863, and, introduced, the, species, as, well, as, other, members, of, australia, s, little, known, faunal, community, to, the, public, 87, 93, comparative, anatomist, richard, owen, in, a, series, of, publications, on, the, physiology, and, anatomy, of, australian, mammals, presented, a, paper, on, the, anatomy, of, the, koala, to, the, zoological, society, of, london, in, this, widely, cited, publication, he, provided, an, early, description, of, its, internal, anatomy, and, noted, its, general, structural, similarity, to, the, wombat, 94, 96, english, naturalist, george, robert, waterhouse, curator, of, the, zoological, society, of, london, was, the, first, to, correctly, classify, the, koala, as, a, marsupial, in, the, 1840s, and, compared, it, to, fossil, species, diprotodon, and, nototherium, which, had, been, discovered, just, recently, 46, 48, similarly, gerard, krefft, curator, of, the, australian, museum, in, sydney, noted, evolutionary, mechanisms, at, work, when, comparing, the, koala, to, fossil, marsupials, in, his, 1871, the, mammals, of, australia, 103, 105, britain, received, its, first, living, koala, in, 1881, which, was, obtained, by, the, zoological, society, of, london, as, related, by, prosecutor, to, the, society, william, alexander, forbes, the, animal, suffered, an, accidental, demise, when, the, heavy, lid, of, a, washstand, fell, on, it, and, it, was, unable, to, free, itself, forbes, dissected, the, specimen, and, wrote, about, the, female, reproductive, system, the, brain, and, the, liver, parts, not, previously, described, by, owen, who, had, access, only, to, preserved, specimens, 105, 06, scottish, embryologist, william, caldwell, well, known, in, scientific, circles, for, determining, the, reproductive, mechanism, of, the, platypus, described, the, uterine, development, of, the, koala, in, 1884, and, used, this, new, information, to, convincingly, map, out, the, evolutionary, timeline, of, the, koala, and, the, monotremes, 111, the, koala, is, known, worldwide, and, is, a, major, draw, for, australian, zoos, and, wildlife, parks, it, has, been, featured, in, popular, culture, and, as, soft, toys, ix, it, benefited, the, australian, tourism, industry, by, over, 1, billion, in, 1998, and, subsequently, grown, 201, its, international, popularly, rose, after, world, war, ii, when, tourism, increased, and, the, animals, were, exported, to, zoos, overseas, 156, in, 1997, about, 75, of, european, and, japanese, tourists, placed, the, koala, at, the, top, of, their, list, of, animals, to, see, 216, according, to, biologist, stephen, jackson, if, you, were, to, take, a, straw, poll, of, the, animal, most, closely, associated, with, australia, it, s, a, fair, bet, that, the, koala, would, come, out, marginally, in, front, of, the, kangaroo, ix, factors, that, contribute, to, the, koala, s, enduring, popularity, include, its, teddy, bear, like, appearance, with, childlike, body, proportions, 3, the, koala, features, in, the, dreamtime, stories, and, mythology, of, indigenous, australians, the, tharawal, people, believed, that, the, animal, helped, them, get, to, australia, by, rowing, the, boat, 21, another, myth, tells, of, a, tribe, that, killed, a, koala, and, used, its, long, intestines, to, create, a, bridge, for, people, from, other, parts, of, the, world, 17, how, the, koala, lost, its, tail, is, the, subject, of, many, tales, in, one, a, kangaroo, cuts, it, off, to, punish, the, koala, for, uncouth, behaviour, 28, tribes, in, queensland, and, victoria, regarded, the, koala, as, a, wise, animal, that, gave, valuable, guidance, bidjara, speaking, people, credited, the, koala, for, making, trees, grow, in, their, arid, lands, 41, 43, the, animal, is, depicted, in, rock, carvings, though, less, so, than, some, other, species, 45, 46, early, european, settlers, in, australia, considered, the, koala, to, be, a, creeping, sloth, like, animal, with, a, fierce, and, menacing, look, 143, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, koala, s, reputation, took, a, positive, turn, it, appears, in, ethel, pedley, s, 1899, book, dot, and, the, kangaroo, as, the, funny, native, bear, 144, artist, norman, lindsay, depicted, a,

president, vladimir, putin, and, us, president, barack, obama, were, photographed, holding, koalas, the, event, gave, rise, to, the, term, koala, diplomacy, which, became, the, oxford, word, of, the, month, for, december, 2016, the, term, also, includes, the, loan, of, koalas, by, the, australian, government, to, overseas, zoos, in, countries, such, as, singapore, and, japan, as, a, form, of, soft, power, diplomacy, like, the, panda, diplomacy, practised, by, china, the, koala, was, originally, classified, as, least, concern, on, the, red, list, and, reassessed, as, vulnerable, in, 2014, in, the, australian, capital, territory, new, south, wales, and, queensland, the, species, was, listed, under, the, epbc, act, in, february, 2022, as, endangered, by, extinction, the, described, population, was, determined, in, 2012, to, be, a, species, for, the, purposes, of, the, epbc, act, 1999, in, federal, legislation, australian, policymakers, declined, a, 2009, proposal, to, include, the, koala, in, the, environment, protection, and, biodiversity, conservation, act, 1999, a, 2017, wwf, report, found, a, 53, decline, per, generation, in, queensland, and, a, 26, decline, in, new, south, wales, the, koala, population, in, south, australia, and, victoria, appear, to, be, abundant, however, the, australian, koala, foundation, akf, argued, that, the, exclusion, of, victorian, populations, from, protective, measures, was, based, on, a, misconception, that, the, total, population, was, 200, 000, whereas, they, believed, in, 2012, that, it, was, probably, less, than, 100, 000, akf, estimated, in, 2022, that, there, could, be, 43, 000, 100, 000, this, compares, with, 8, to, 10, million, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, the, australian, government, s, threatened, species, scientific, committee, estimated, that, the, 2021, koala, population, was, 92, 000, down, from, 185, 000, two, decades, prior, the, koala, was, heavily, hunted, by, european, settlers, in, the, early, 20th, century, 121, 128, largely, for, its, fur, australia, exported, as, many, as, two, million, pelts, by, 1924, koala, furs, were, used, to, make, rugs, coat, linings, muffs, and, on, women, s, garment, trimmings, 125, the, first, successful, efforts, at, conserving, the, species, were, initiated, by, the, establishment, of, brisbane, s, lone, pine, koala, sanctuary, and, sydney, s, koala, park, sanctuary, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, its, owner, noel, burnet, created, the, first, successful, breeding, program, 157, 159, one, of, the, biggest, anthropogenic, threats, to, the, koala, is, habitat, destruction, and, fragmentation, near, the, coast, the, main, cause, of, this, is, urbanisation, while, in, rural, areas, habitat, is, cleared, for, agriculture, its, favoured, trees, are, harvested, for, wood, products, 104, 107, in, 2000, australia, had, the, fifth, highest, rate, of, land, clearance, globally, stripping, 564, 800, hectares, 1, 396, 000, acres, of, native, plants, 222, the, koalas, distribution, has, shrunk, by, more, than, 50, since, european, arrival, largely, due, to, habitat, fragmentation, in, queensland, nevertheless, koalas, live, in, many, protected, areas, while, urbanisation, can, pose, a, threat, to, koala, populations, the, animals, can, survive, in, urban, areas, given, enough, trees, urban, populations, have, distinct, vulnerabilities, collisions, with, vehicles, and, attacks, by, domestic, dogs, cars, and, dogs, kill, about, 4, 000, animals, every, year, to, reduce, road, deaths, government, agencies, have, been, exploring, various, wildlife, crossing, options, such, as, the, use, of, fencing, to, channel, animals, toward, an, underpass, in, some, cases, adding, a, walkway, to, an, existing, culvert, injured, koalas, are, often, taken, to, wildlife, hospitals, and, rehabilitation, centres, in, a, 30, year, retrospective, study, performed, at, a, new, south, wales, koala, rehabilitation, centre, trauma, was, found, to, be, the, most, frequent, cause, of, admission, followed, by, symptoms, of, chlamydia, infection
