the, pancreas, is, an, organ, of, the, digestive, system, and, endocrine, system, of, vertebrates, in, humans, it, is, located, in, the, abdomen, behind, the, stomach, and, functions, as, a, gland, the, pancreas, is, a, mixed, or, heterocrine, gland, i, e, it, has, both, an, endocrine, and, a, digestive, exocrine, function, 99, of, the, pancreas, is, exocrine, and, 1, is, endocrine, as, an, endocrine, gland, it, functions, mostly, to, regulate, blood, sugar, levels, secreting, the, hormones, insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and, pancreatic, polypeptide, as, a, part, of, the, digestive, system, it, functions, as, an, exocrine, gland, secreting, pancreatic, juice, into, the, duodenum, through, the, pancreatic, duct, this, juice, contains, bicarbonate, which, neutralizes, acid, entering, the, duodenum, from, the, stomach, and, digestive, enzymes, which, break, down, carbohydrates, proteins, and, fats, in, food, entering, the, duodenum, from, the, stomach, inflammation, of, the, pancreas, is, known, as, pancreatitis, with, common, causes, including, chronic, alcohol, use, and, gallstones, because, of, its, role, in, the, regulation, of, blood, sugar, the, pancreas, is, also, a, key, organ, in, diabetes, mellitus, pancreatic, cancer, can, arise, following, chronic, pancreatitis, or, due, to, other, reasons, and, carries, a, very, poor, prognosis, as, it, is, often, only, identified, after, it, has, spread, to, other, areas, of, the, body, the, word, pancreas, comes, from, the, greek, p, n, all, kr, as, flesh, the, function, of, the, pancreas, in, diabetes, has, been, known, since, at, least, 1889, with, its, role, in, insulin, production, identified, in, 1921, the, pancreas, is, an, organ, that, in, humans, lies, in, the, abdomen, stretching, from, behind, the, stomach, to, the, left, upper, abdomen, near, the, spleen, in, adults, it, is, about, 12, 15, centimetres, 4, 7, 5, 9, in, long, lobulated, and, salmon, coloured, in, appearance, anatomically, the, pancreas, is, divided, into, a, head, neck, body, and, tail, the, pancreas, stretches, from, the, inner, curvature, of, the, duodenum, where, the, head, surrounds, two, blood, vessels, the, superior, mesenteric, artery, and, vein, the, longest, part, of, the, pancreas, the, body, stretches, across, behind, the, stomach, and, the, tail, of, the, pancreas, ends, adjacent, to, the, spleen, two, ducts, the, main, pancreatic, duct, and, a, smaller, accessory, pancreatic, duct, run, through, the, body, of, the, pancreas, the, main, pancreatic, duct, joins, with, the, common, bile, duct, forming, a, small, ballooning, called, the, ampulla, of, vater, hepatopancreatic, ampulla, this, ampulla, is, surrounded, by, a, muscle, the, sphincter, of, oddi, this, ampulla, opens, into, the, descending, part, of, the, duodenum, the, opening, of, the, common, bile, duct, into, main, pancreatic, duct, is, controlled, by, sphincter, of, boyden, the, accessory, pancreatic, duct, opens, into, duodenum, with, separate, openings, located, above, the, opening, of, the, main, pancreatic, duct, the, head, of, the, pancreas, sits, within, the, curvature, of, the, duodenum, and, wraps, around, the, superior, mesenteric, artery, and, vein, to, the, right, sits, the, descending, part, of, the, duodenum, and, between, these, travel, the, superior, and, inferior, pancreaticoduodenal, arteries, behind, rests, the, inferior, vena, cava, and, the, common, bile, duct, in, front, sits, the, peritoneal, membrane, and, the, transverse, colon, a, small, uncinate, process, emerges, from, below, the, head, situated, behind, the, superior, mesenteric, vein, and, sometimes, artery, the, neck, of, the, pancreas, separates, the, head, of, the, pancreas, located, in, the, curvature, of, the, duodenum, from, the, body, the, neck, is, about, 2, cm, 0, 79, in, wide, and, sits, in, front, of, where, the, portal, vein, is, formed, the, neck, lies, mostly, behind, the, pylorus, of, the, stomach, and, is, covered, with, peritoneum, the, anterior, superior, pancreaticoduodenal, artery, travels, in, front, of, the, neck, of, the, pancreas, the, body, is, the, largest, part, of, the, pancreas, and, mostly, lies, behind, the, stomach, tapering, along, its, length, the, peritoneum, sits, on, top, of, the, body, of, the, pancreas, and, the, transverse, colon, in, front, of, the, peritoneum, behind, the, pancreas, are, several, blood, vessels, including, the, aorta, the, splenic, vein, and, the, left, renal, vein, as, well, as, the, beginning, of, the, superior, mesenteric, artery, below, the, body, of, the, pancreas, sits, some, of, the, small, intestine, specifically, the, last, part, of, the, duodenum, and, the, jejunum, to, which, it, connects, as, well, as, the, suspensory, ligament, of, the, duodenum, which, falls, between, these, two, in, front, of, the, pancreas, sits, the, transverse, colon, the, pancreas, narrows, towards, the, tail, which, sits, near, to, the, spleen, it, is, usually, between, 1, 3, 3, 5, cm, 0, 51, 1, 38, in, long, and, sits, between, the, layers, of, the, ligament, between, the, spleen, and, the, left, kidney, the, splenic, artery, and, vein, which, also, passes, behind, the, body, of, the, pancreas, pass, behind, the, tail, of, the, pancreas, the, pancreas, has, a, rich, blood, supply, with, vessels, originating, as, branches, of, both, the, coeliac, artery, and, superior, mesenteric, artery, the, splenic, artery, the, largest, branch, of, the, celiac, trunk, runs, along, the, top, of, the, pancreas, and, supplies, the, left, part, of, the, body, and, the, tail, of, the, pancreas, through, its, pancreatic, branches, the, largest, of, which, is, called, the, greater, pancreatic, artery, the, superior, and, inferior, pancreaticoduodenal, arteries, run, along, the, back, and, front, surfaces, of, the, head, of, the, pancreas, adjacent, to, the, duodenum, these, supply, the, head, of, the, pancreas, these, vessels, join, together, anastamose, in, the, middle, the, body, and, neck, of, the, pancreas, drain, into, the, splenic, vein, which, sits, behind, the, pancreas, the, head, drains, into, and, wraps, around, the, superior, mesenteric, and, portal, veins, via, the, pancreaticoduodenal, veins, the, pancreas, drains, into, lymphatic, vessels, that, travel, alongside, its, arteries, and, has, a, rich, lymphatic, supply, the, lymphatic, vessels, of, the, body, and, tail, drain, into, splenic, lymph, nodes, and, eventually, into, lymph, nodes, that, lie, in, front, of, the, aorta, between, the, coeliac, and, superior, mesenteric, arteries, the, lymphatic, vessels, of, the, head, and, neck, drain, into, intermediate, lymphatic, vessels, around, the, pancreaticoduodenal, mesenteric, and, hepatic, arteries, and, from, there, into, the, lymph, nodes, that, lie, in, front, of, the, aorta, the, pancreas, contains, tissue, with, an, endocrine, and, exocrine, role, and, this, division, is, also, visible, when, the, pancreas, is, viewed, under, a, microscope, the, majority, of, pancreatic, tissue, has, a, digestive, role, the, cells, with, this, role, form, clusters, latin, acini, around, small, ducts, and, are, arranged, in, lobes, that, have, thin, fibrous, walls, the, cells, of, each, acinus, secrete, inactive, digestive, enzymes, called, zymogens, into, the, small, intercalated, ducts, which, they, surround, in, each, acinus, the, cells, are, pyramid, shaped, and, situated, around, the, intercalated, ducts, with, the, nuclei, resting, on, the, basement, membrane, a, large, endoplasmic, reticulum, and, a, number, of, zymogen, granules, visible, within, the, cytoplasm, the, intercalated, ducts, drain, into, larger, intralobular, ducts, within, the, lobule, and, finally, interlobular, ducts, the, ducts, are, lined, by, a, single, layer, of, column, shaped, cells, there, is, more, than, one, layer, of, cells, as, the, diameter, of, the, ducts, increases, the, tissues, with, an, endocrine, role, within, the, pancreas, exist, as, clusters, of, cells, called, pancreatic, islets, also, called, islets, of, langerhans, that, are, distributed, throughout, the, pancreas, pancreatic, islets, contain, alpha, cells, beta, cells, and, delta, cells, each, of, which, releases, a, different, hormone, these, cells, have, characteristic, positions, with, alpha, cells, secreting, glucagon, tending, to, be, situated, around, the, periphery, of, the, islet, and, beta, cells, secreting, insulin, more, numerous, and, found, throughout, the, islet, enterochromaffin, cells, are, also, scattered, throughout, the, islets, islets, are, composed, of, up, to, 3, 000, secretory, cells, and, contain, several, small, arterioles, to, receive, blood, and, venules, that, allow, the, hormones, secreted, by, the, cells, to, enter, the, systemic, circulation, the, size, of, the, pancreas, varies, considerably, several, anatomical, variations, exist, relating, to, the, embryological, development, of, the, two, pancreatic, buds, the, pancreas, develops, from, these, buds, on, either, side, of, the, duodenum, the, ventral, bud, rotates, to, lie, next, to, the, dorsal, bud, eventually, fusing, in, about, 10, of, adults, an, accessory, pancreatic, duct, may, be, present, if, the, main, duct, of, the, dorsal, bud, of, the, pancreas, does, not, regress, this, duct, opens, into, the, minor, duodenal, papilla, if, the, two, buds, themselves, each, having, a, duct, do, not, fuse, a, pancreas, may, exist, with, two, separate, ducts, a, condition, known, as, a, pancreas, divisum, this, condition, has, no, physiologic, consequence, if, the, ventral, bud, does, not, fully, rotate, an, annular, pancreas, may, exist, where, part, or, all, of, the, duodenum, is, encircled, by, the, pancreas, this, may, be, associated, with, duodenal, atresia, 10, 000, protein, coding, genes, 50, of, all, human, genes, are, expressed, in, the, normal, human, pancreas, less, than, 100, of, these, genes, are, specifically, expressed, in, the, pancreas, similar, to, the, salivary, glands, most, pancreas, specific, genes, encode, for, secreted, proteins, corresponding, pancreas, specific, proteins, are, either, expressed, in, the, exocrine, cellular, compartment, and, have, functions, related, to, digestion, or, food, uptake, such, as, digestive, chymotrypsinogen, enzymes, and, pancreatic, lipase, pnlip, or, are, expressed, in, the, various, cells, of, the, endocrine, pancreatic, islets, and, have, functions, related, to, secreted, hormones, such, as, insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and, pancreatic, polypeptide, the, pancreas, forms, during, development, from, two, buds, that, arise, from, the, duodenal, part, of, the, foregut, an, embryonic, tube, that, is, a, precursor, to, the, gastrointestinal, tract, it, is, of, endodermal, origin, pancreatic, development, begins, with, the, formation, of, a, dorsal, and, ventral, pancreatic, bud, each, joins, with, the, foregut, through, a, duct, the, dorsal, pancreatic, bud, forms, the, neck, body, and, tail, of, the, developed, pancreas, and, the, ventral, pancreatic, bud, forms, the, head, and, uncinate, process, the, definitive, pancreas, results, from, rotation, of, the, ventral, bud, and, the, fusion, of, the, two, buds, during, development, the, duodenum, rotates, to, the, right, and, the, ventral, bud, rotates, with, it, moving, to, a, position, that, becomes, more, dorsal, upon, reaching, its, final, destination, the, ventral, pancreatic, bud, is, below, the, larger, dorsal, bud, and, eventually, fuses, with, it, at, this, point, of, fusion, the, main, ducts, of, the, ventral, and, dorsal, pancreatic, buds, fuse, forming, the, main, pancreatic, duct, usually, the, duct, of, the, dorsal, bud, regresses, leaving, the, main, pancreatic, duct, pancreatic, progenitor, cells, are, precursor, cells, that, differentiate, into, the, functional, pancreatic, cells, including, exocrine, acinar, cells, endocrine, islet, cells, and, ductal, cells, these, progenitor, cells, are, characterised, by, the, co, expression, of, the, transcription, factors, pdx1, and, nkx6, 1, the, cells, of, the, exocrine, pancreas, differentiate, through, molecules, that, induce, differentiation, including, follistatin, fibroblast, growth, factors, and, activation, of, the, notch, receptor, system, development, of, the, exocrine, acini, progresses, through, three, successive, stages, these, are, the, predifferentiated, protodifferentiated, and, differentiated, stages, which, correspond, to, undetectable, low, and, high, levels, of, digestive, enzyme, activity, respectively, pancreatic, progenitor, cells, differentiate, into, endocrine, islet, cells, under, the, influence, of, neurogenin, 3, and, isl1, but, only, in, the, absence, of, notch, receptor, signaling, under, the, direction, of, a, pax, gene, the, endocrine, precursor, cells, differentiate, to, form, alpha, and, gamma, cells, under, the, direction, of, pax, 6, the, endocrine, precursor, cells, differentiate, to, form, beta, and, delta, cells, the, pancreatic, islets, form, as, the, endocrine, cells, migrate, from, the, duct, system, to, form, small, clusters, around, capillaries, this, occurs, around, the, third, month, of, development, and, insulin, and, glucagon, can, be, detected, in, the, human, fetal, circulation, by, the, fourth, or, fifth, month, of, development, the, pancreas, is, involved, in, blood, sugar, control, and, metabolism, within, the, body, and, also, in, the, secretion, of, substances, collectively, pancreatic, juice, that, help, digestion, these, are, divided, into, an, endocrine, role, relating, to, the, secretion, of, insulin, and, other, substances, within, pancreatic, islets, that, help, control, blood, sugar, levels, and, metabolism, within, the, body, and, an, exocrine, role, relating, to, the, secretion, of, enzymes, involved, in, digesting, substances, in, the, digestive, tract, cells, within, the, pancreas, help, to, maintain, blood, glucose, levels, homeostasis, the, cells, that, do, this, are, located, within, the, pancreatic, islets, that, are, present, throughout, the, pancreas, when, blood, glucose, levels, are, low, alpha, cells, secrete, glucagon, which, increases, blood, glucose, levels, when, blood, glucose, levels, are, high, beta, cells, secrete, insulin, to, decrease, glucose, in, blood, delta, cells, in, the, islet, also, secrete, somatostatin, which, decreases, the, release, of, insulin, and, glucagon, glucagon, acts, to, increase, glucose, levels, by, promoting, the, creation, of, glucose, and, the, breakdown, of, glycogen, to, glucose, in, the, liver, it, also, decreases, the, uptake, of, glucose, in, fat, and, muscle, glucagon, release, is, stimulated, by, low, blood, glucose, or, insulin, levels, and, during, exercise, insulin, acts, to, decrease, blood, glucose, levels, by, facilitating, uptake, by, cells, particularly, skeletal, muscle, and, promoting, its, use, in, the, creation, of, proteins, fats, and, carbohydrates, insulin, is, initially, created, as, a, precursor, form, called, preproinsulin, this, is, converted, to, proinsulin, and, cleaved, by, c, peptide, to, insulin, which, is, then, stored, in, granules, in, beta, cells, glucose, is, taken, into, the, beta, cells, and, degraded, the, end, effect, of, this, is, to, cause, depolarisation, of, the, cell, membrane, which, stimulates, the, release, of, the, insulin, the, main, factor, influencing, the, secretion, of, insulin, and, glucagon, are, the, levels, of, glucose, in, blood, plasma, low, blood, sugar, stimulates, glucagon, release, and, high, blood, sugar, stimulates, insulin, release, other, factors, also, influence, the, secretion, of, these, hormones, some, amino, acids, that, are, byproducts, of, the, digestion, of, protein, stimulate, insulin, and, glucagon, release, somatostatin, acts, as, an, inhibitor, of, both, insulin, and, glucagon, the, autonomic, nervous, system, also, plays, a, role, activation, of, beta, 2, receptors, of, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, by, catecholamines, secreted, from, sympathetic, nerves, stimulates, secretion, of, insulin, and, glucagon, whereas, activation, of, alpha, 1, receptors, inhibits, secretion, m3, receptors, of, the, parasympathetic, nervous, system, act, when, stimulated, by, the, right, vagus, nerve, to, stimulate, release, of, insulin, from, beta, cells, the, pancreas, plays, a, vital, role, in, the, digestive, system, it, does, this, by, secreting, a, fluid, that, contains, digestive, enzymes, into, the, duodenum, the, first, part, of, the, small, intestine, that, receives, food, from, the, stomach, these, enzymes, help, to, break, down, carbohydrates, proteins, and, lipids, fats, this, role, is, called, the, exocrine, role, of, the, pancreas, the, cells, that, do, this, are, arranged, in, clusters, called, acini, secretions, into, the, middle, of, the, acinus, accumulate, in, intralobular, ducts, which, drain, to, the, main, pancreatic, duct, which, drains, directly, into, the, duodenum, about, 1, 5, 3, liters, of, fluid, are, secreted, in, this, manner, every, day, the, cells, in, each, acinus, are, filled, with, granules, containing, the, digestive, enzymes, these, are, secreted, in, an, inactive, form, termed, zymogens, or, proenzymes, when, released, into, the, duodenum, they, are, activated, by, the, enzyme, enterokinase, present, in, the, lining, of, the, duodenum, the, proenzymes, are, cleaved, creating, a, cascade, of, activating, enzymes, these, enzymes, are, secreted, in, a, fluid, rich, in, bicarbonate, bicarbonate, helps, maintain, an, alkaline, ph, for, the, fluid, a, ph, in, which, most, of, the, enzymes, act, most, efficiently, and, also, helps, to, neutralise, the, stomach, acids, that, enter, the, duodenum, secretion, is, influenced, by, hormones, including, secretin, cholecystokinin, and, vip, as, well, as, acetylcholine, stimulation, from, the, vagus, nerve, secretin, is, released, from, the, s, cells, which, form, part, of, the, lining, of, the, duodenum, in, response, to, stimulation, by, gastric, acid, along, with, vip, it, increases, the, secretion, of, enzymes, and, bicarbonate, cholecystokinin, is, released, from, ito, cells, of, the, lining, of, the, duodenum, and, jejunum, mostly, in, response, to, long, chain, fatty, acids, and, increases, the, effects, of, secretin, at, a, cellular, level, bicarbonate, is, secreted, from, centroacinar, and, ductal, cells, through, a, sodium, and, bicarbonate, cotransporter, that, acts, because, of, membrane, depolarisation, caused, by, the, cystic, fibrosis, transmembrane, conductance, regulator, secretin, and, vip, act, to, increase, the, opening, of, the, cystic, fibrosis, transmembrane, conductance, regulator, which, leads, to, more, membrane, depolarisation, and, more, secretion, of, bicarbonate, a, variety, of, mechanisms, act, to, ensure, that, the, digestive, action, of, the, pancreas, does, not, act, to, digest, pancreatic, tissue, itself, these, include, the, secretion, of, inactive, enzymes, zymogens, the, secretion, of, the, protective, enzyme, trypsin, inhibitor, which, inactivates, trypsin, the, changes, in, ph, that, occur, with, bicarbonate, secretion, that, stimulate, digestion, only, when, the, pancreas, is, stimulated, and, the, fact, that, the, low, calcium, within, cells, causes, inactivation, of, trypsin, the, pancreas, also, secretes, vasoactive, intestinal, peptide, and, pancreatic, polypeptide, enterochromaffin, cells, of, the, pancreas, secrete, the, hormones, motilin, serotonin, and, substance, p, inflammation, of, the, pancreas, is, known, as, pancreatitis, pancreatitis, is, most, often, associated, with, recurrent, gallstones, or, chronic, alcohol, use, with, other, common, causes, including, traumatic, damage, damage, following, an, ercp, some, medications, infections, such, as, mumps, and, very, high, blood, triglyceride, levels, acute, pancreatitis, is, likely, to, cause, intense, pain, in, the, central, abdomen, that, often, radiates, to, the, back, and, may, be, associated, with, nausea, or, vomiting, severe, pancreatitis, may, lead, to, bleeding, or, perforation, of, the, pancreas, resulting, in, shock, or, a, systemic, inflammatory, response, syndrome, bruising, of, the, flanks, or, the, region, around, the, belly, button, these, severe, complications, are, often, managed, in, an, intensive, care, unit, in, pancreatitis, enzymes, of, the, exocrine, pancreas, damage, the, structure, and, tissue, of, the, pancreas, detection, of, some, of, these, enzymes, such, as, amylase, and, lipase, in, the, blood, along, with, symptoms, and, findings, on, medical, imaging, such, as, ultrasound, or, a, ct, scan, are, often, used, to, indicate, that, a, person, has, pancreatitis, pancreatitis, is, often, managed, medically, with, pain, relief, and, monitoring, to, prevent, or, manage, shock, and, management, of, any, identified, underlying, causes, this, may, include, removal, of, gallstones, lowering, of, blood, triglyceride, or, glucose, levels, the, use, of, corticosteroids, for, autoimmune, pancreatitis, and, the, cessation, of, any, medication, triggers, chronic, pancreatitis, refers, to, the, development, of, pancreatitis, over, time, it, shares, many, similar, causes, with, the, most, common, being, chronic, alcohol, use, with, other, causes, including, recurrent, acute, episodes, and, cystic, fibrosis, abdominal, pain, characteristically, relieved, by, sitting, forward, or, drinking, alcohol, is, the, most, common, symptom, when, the, digestive, function, of, the, pancreas, is, severely, affected, this, may, lead, to, problems, with, fat, digestion, and, the, development, of, steatorrhoea, when, the, endocrine, function, is, affected, this, may, lead, to, diabetes, chronic, pancreatitis, is, investigated, in, a, similar, way, to, acute, pancreatitis, in, addition, to, management, of, pain, and, nausea, and, management, of, any, identified, causes, which, may, include, alcohol, cessation, because, of, the, digestive, role, of, the, pancreas, enzyme, replacement, may, be, needed, to, prevent, malabsorption, pancreatic, cancers, particularly, the, most, common, type, pancreatic, adenocarcinoma, remain, very, difficult, to, treat, and, are, mostly, diagnosed, only, at, a, stage, that, is, too, late, for, surgery, which, is, the, only, curative, treatment, pancreatic, cancer, is, rare, in, people, younger, than, 40, and, the, median, age, of, diagnosis, is, 71, risk, factors, include, chronic, pancreatitis, older, age, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and, certain, rare, genetic, conditions, including, multiple, endocrine, neoplasia, type, 1, hereditary, nonpolyposis, colon, cancer, and, dysplastic, nevus, syndrome, among, others, about, 25, of, cases, are, attributable, to, tobacco, smoking, while, 5, 10, of, cases, are, linked, to, inherited, genes, pancreatic, adenocarcinoma, is, the, most, common, form, of, pancreatic, cancer, and, is, cancer, arising, from, the, exocrine, digestive, part, of, the, pancreas, most, occur, in, the, head, of, the, pancreas, symptoms, tend, to, arise, late, in, the, course, of, the, cancer, when, it, causes, abdominal, pain, weight, loss, or, yellowing, of, the, skin, jaundice, jaundice, occurs, when, the, outflow, of, bile, is, blocked, by, the, cancer, other, less, common, symptoms, include, nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis, diabetes, or, recurrent, venous, thrombosis, pancreatic, cancer, is, usually, diagnosed, by, medical, imaging, in, the, form, of, an, ultrasound, or, ct, scan, with, contrast, enhancement, an, endoscopic, ultrasound, may, be, used, if, a, tumour, is, being, considered, for, surgical, removal, and, biopsy, guided, by, ercp, or, ultrasound, can, be, used, to, confirm, an, uncertain, diagnosis, because, of, the, late, development, of, symptoms, most, cancer, presents, at, an, advanced, stage, only, 10, to, 15, of, tumours, are, suitable, for, surgical, resection, as, of, 2018, when, chemotherapy, is, given, the, folfirinox, regimen, containing, fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and, leucovorin, has, been, shown, to, extend, survival, beyond, traditional, gemcitabine, regimens, for, the, most, part, treatment, is, palliative, focus, on, the, management, of, symptoms, that, develop, this, may, include, management, of, itch, a, choledochojejunostomy, or, the, insertion, of, stents, with, ercp, to, facilitate, the, drainage, of, bile, and, medications, to, help, control, pain, in, the, united, states, pancreatic, cancer, is, the, fourth, most, common, cause, of, deaths, due, to, cancer, the, disease, occurs, more, often, in, the, developed, world, which, had, 68, of, new, cases, in, 2012, pancreatic, adenocarcinoma, typically, has, poor, outcomes, with, the, average, percentage, alive, for, at, least, one, and, five, years, after, diagnosis, being, 25, and, 5, respectively, in, localized, disease, where, the, cancer, is, small, 2, cm, the, number, alive, at, five, years, is, approximately, 20, there, are, several, types, of, pancreatic, cancer, involving, both, the, endocrine, and, exocrine, tissue, the, many, types, of, pancreatic, endocrine, tumors, are, all, uncommon, or, rare, and, have, varied, outlooks, however, the, incidence, of, these, cancers, has, been, rising, sharply, it, is, not, clear, to, what, extent, this, reflects, increased, detection, especially, through, medical, imaging, of, tumors, that, would, be, very, slow, to, develop, insulinomas, largely, benign, and, gastrinomas, are, the, most, common, types, for, those, with, neuroendocrine, cancers, the, number, alive, after, five, years, is, much, better, at, 65, varying, considerably, with, type, a, solid, pseudopapillary, tumour, is, a, low, grade, malignant, tumour, of, the, pancreas, of, papillary, architecture, that, typically, afflicts, young, women, diabetes, mellitus, type, 1, is, a, chronic, autoimmune, disease, in, which, the, immune, system, attacks, the, insulin, secreting, beta, cells, of, the, pancreas, insulin, is, needed, to, keep, blood, sugar, levels, within, optimal, ranges, and, its, lack, can, lead, to, high, blood, sugar, as, an, untreated, chronic, condition, complications, including, accelerated, vascular, disease, diabetic, retinopathy, kidney, disease, and, neuropathy, can, result, in, addition, if, there, is, not, enough, insulin, for, glucose, to, be, used, within, cells, the, medical, emergency, diabetic, ketoacidosis, which, is, often, the, first, symptom, that, a, person, with, type, 1, diabetes, may, have, can, result, type, 1, diabetes, can, develop, at, any, age, but, is, most, often, diagnosed, before, age, 40, for, people, living, with, type, 1, diabetes, insulin, injections, are, critical, for, survival, an, experimental, procedure, to, treat, type, 1, diabetes, is, pancreas, transplantation, or, isolated, transplantation, of, islet, cells, to, supply, a, person, with, functioning, beta, cells, diabetes, mellitus, type, 2, is, the, most, common, form, of, diabetes, the, causes, for, high, blood, sugar, in, this, form, of, diabetes, usually, are, a, combination, of, insulin, resistance, and, impaired, insulin, secretion, with, both, genetic, and, environmental, factors, playing, a, role, in, the, development, of, the, disease, over, time, pancreatic, beta, cells, may, become, exhausted, and, less, functional, the, management, of, type, 2, diabetes, involves, a, combination, of, lifestyle, measures, medications, if, required, and, potentially, insulin, with, relevance, to, the, pancreas, several, medications, act, to, enhance, the, secretion, of, insulin, from, beta, cells, particularly, sulphonylureas, which, act, directly, on, beta, cells, incretins, which, replicate, the, action, of, the, hormones, glucagon, like, peptide, 1, increasing, the, secretion, of, insulin, from, beta, cells, after, meals, and, are, more, resistant, to, breakdown, and, dpp, 4, inhibitors, which, slow, the, breakdown, of, incretins, it, is, possible, for, a, person, to, live, without, a, pancreas, provided, that, the, person, takes, insulin, for, proper, regulation, of, blood, glucose, concentration, and, pancreatic, enzyme, supplements, to, aid, digestion, the, pancreas, was, first, identified, by, herophilus, 335, 280, bc, a, greek, anatomist, and, surgeon, a, few, hundred, years, later, rufus, of, ephesus, another, greek, anatomist, gave, the, pancreas, its, name, etymologically, the, term, pancreas, a, modern, latin, adaptation, of, greek, originally, means, sweetbread, although, literally, meaning, all, flesh, presumably, because, of, its, fleshy, consistency, it, was, only, in, 1889, when, oskar, minkowski, discovered, that, removing, the, pancreas, from, a, dog, caused, it, to, become, diabetic, insulin, was, later, isolated, from, pancreatic, islets, by, frederick, banting, and, charles, best, in, 1921, the, way, the, tissue, of, the, pancreas, has, been, viewed, has, also, changed, previously, it, was, viewed, using, simple, staining, methods, such, as, h, e, stains, now, immunohistochemistry, can, be, used, to, more, easily, differentiate, cell, types, this, involves, visible, antibodies, to, the, products, of, certain, cell, types, and, helps, identify, with, greater, ease, cell, types, such, as, alpha, and, beta, cells, pancreatic, tissue, is, present, in, all, vertebrates, but, its, precise, form, and, arrangement, varies, widely, there, may, be, up, to, three, separate, pancreases, two, of, which, arise, from, the, pancreatic, bud, and, the, other, dorsally, in, most, species, including, humans, these, fuse, in, the, adult, but, there, are, several, exceptions, even, when, a, single, pancreas, is, present, two, or, three, pancreatic, ducts, may, persist, each, draining, separately, into, the, duodenum, or, equivalent, part, of, the, foregut, birds, for, example, typically, have, three, such, ducts, in, teleost, fish, and, a, few, other, species, such, as, rabbits, there, is, no, discrete, pancreas, at, all, with, pancreatic, tissue, being, distributed, diffusely, across, the, mesentery, and, even, within, other, nearby, organs, such, as, the, liver, or, spleen, in, a, few, teleost, species, the, endocrine, tissue, has, fused, to, form, a, distinct, gland, within, the, abdominal, cavity, but, otherwise, it, is, distributed, among, the, exocrine, components, the, most, primitive, arrangement, however, appears, to, be, that, of, lampreys, and, lungfish, in, which, pancreatic, tissue, is, found, as, a, number, of, discrete, nodules, within, the, wall, of, the, gut, itself, with, the, exocrine, portions, being, little, different, from, other, glandular, structures, of, the, intestine, the, pancreas, of, calf, ris, de, veau, or, lamb, ris, d, agneau, and, less, commonly, of, beef, or, pork, are, used, as, food, under, the, culinary, name, of, sweetbread
