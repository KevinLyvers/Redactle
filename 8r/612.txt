falco, haliaetus, linnaeus, 1758, the, osprey, s, p, r, i, p, r, e, pandion, haliaetus, historically, known, as, sea, hawk, river, hawk, and, fish, hawk, is, a, diurnal, fish, eating, bird, of, prey, with, a, cosmopolitan, range, it, is, a, large, raptor, reaching, more, than, 60, cm, 24, in, in, length, and, 180, cm, 71, in, across, the, wings, it, is, brown, on, the, upperparts, and, predominantly, greyish, on, the, head, and, underparts, the, osprey, tolerates, a, wide, variety, of, habitats, nesting, in, any, location, near, a, body, of, water, providing, an, adequate, food, supply, it, is, found, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, although, in, south, america, it, occurs, only, as, a, non, breeding, migrant, as, its, other, common, names, suggest, the, osprey, s, diet, consists, almost, exclusively, of, fish, it, possesses, specialised, physical, characteristics, and, unique, behaviour, in, hunting, its, prey, because, of, its, unique, characteristics, it, is, classified, in, its, own, taxonomic, genus, pandion, and, family, pandionidae, the, osprey, was, described, in, 1758, by, the, swedish, naturalist, carl, linnaeus, under, the, name, falco, haliaetus, in, his, landmark, tenth, edition, of, his, systema, naturae, linnaeus, specified, the, type, locality, as, europe, but, in, 1761, he, restricted, the, locality, to, sweden, the, osprey, is, the, only, species, placed, in, the, genus, pandion, that, was, introduced, by, the, french, zoologist, marie, jules, c, sar, savigny, in, 1809, the, genus, is, the, sole, member, of, the, family, pandionidae, the, species, has, always, presented, a, riddle, to, taxonomists, but, here, it, is, treated, as, the, sole, living, member, of, the, family, pandionidae, and, the, family, listed, in, its, traditional, place, as, part, of, the, order, accipitriformes, other, schemes, place, it, alongside, the, hawks, and, eagles, in, the, family, accipitridae, the, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, has, placed, it, together, with, the, other, diurnal, raptors, in, a, greatly, enlarged, ciconiiformes, but, this, results, in, an, unnatural, paraphyletic, classification, molecular, phylogenetic, analysis, has, found, that, the, family, pandionidae, is, sister, to, the, family, accipitridae, it, is, estimated, that, the, two, families, diverged, around, 50, 8, million, years, ago, the, osprey, is, unusual, in, that, it, is, a, sole, living, species, that, occurs, nearly, worldwide, even, the, few, subspecies, are, not, unequivocally, separable, there, are, four, generally, recognised, subspecies, although, differences, are, small, and, itis, lists, only, the, first, three, two, extinct, species, were, named, from, the, fossil, record, pandion, homalopteron, described, by, stuart, l, warter, in, 1976, was, found, in, marine, middle, miocene, deposits, of, the, barstovian, age, in, the, southern, part, of, california, the, second, species, pandion, lovensis, was, described, by, jonathan, j, becker, in, 1985, and, found, in, florida, it, dates, to, the, late, clarendonian, and, possibly, represents, a, separate, lineage, from, that, of, p, homalopteron, and, p, haliaetus, a, number, of, claw, fossils, have, been, recovered, from, pliocene, and, pleistocene, sediments, in, florida, and, south, carolina, the, oldest, recognized, family, pandionidae, fossils, were, recovered, from, the, oligocene, age, jebel, qatrani, formation, in, faiyum, governorate, egypt, however, they, are, not, complete, enough, to, assign, to, a, specific, genus, another, pandionidae, claw, fossil, was, recovered, from, early, oligocene, deposits, in, the, mainz, basin, germany, and, was, described, in, 2006, by, gerald, mayr, the, genus, name, pandion, derives, from, pand, n, the, mythical, greek, king, of, athens, and, grandfather, of, theseus, pandion, ii, the, species, name, haliaetus, latin, haliaeetus, comes, from, greek, hali, etos, sea, eagle, also, haliaietos, from, the, combining, form, hali, of, hals, sea, and, aetos, eagle, the, origins, of, osprey, are, obscure, the, word, itself, was, first, recorded, around, 1460, derived, via, the, anglo, french, ospriet, and, the, medieval, latin, avis, prede, bird, of, prey, from, the, latin, avis, praedae, though, the, oxford, english, dictionary, notes, a, connection, with, the, latin, ossifraga, or, bone, breaker, of, pliny, the, elder, however, this, term, referred, to, the, bearded, vulture, the, osprey, differs, in, several, respects, from, other, diurnal, birds, of, prey, its, toes, are, of, equal, length, its, tarsi, are, reticulate, and, its, talons, are, rounded, rather, than, grooved, the, osprey, and, owls, are, the, only, raptors, whose, outer, toe, is, reversible, allowing, them, to, grasp, their, prey, with, two, toes, in, front, and, two, behind, this, is, particularly, helpful, when, they, grab, slippery, fish, the, osprey, is, 0, 9, 2, 1, kg, 2, 0, 4, 6, lb, in, weight, and, 50, 66, cm, 20, 26, in, in, length, with, a, 127, 180, cm, 50, 71, in, wingspan, it, is, thus, of, similar, size, to, the, largest, members, of, the, buteo, or, falco, genera, the, subspecies, are, fairly, close, in, size, with, the, nominate, subspecies, averaging, 1, 53, kg, 3, 4, lb, p, h, carolinensis, averaging, 1, 7, kg, 3, 7, lb, and, p, h, cristatus, averaging, 1, 25, kg, 2, 8, lb, the, wing, chord, measures, 38, to, 52, cm, 15, to, 20, in, the, tail, measures, 16, 5, to, 24, cm, 6, 5, to, 9, 4, in, and, the, tarsus, is, 5, 2, 6, 6, cm, 2, 0, 2, 6, in, the, upperparts, are, a, deep, glossy, brown, while, the, breast, is, white, sometimes, streaked, with, brown, and, the, underparts, are, pure, white, the, head, is, white, with, a, dark, mask, across, the, eyes, reaching, to, the, sides, of, the, neck, the, irises, of, the, eyes, are, golden, to, brown, and, the, transparent, nictitating, membrane, is, pale, blue, the, bill, is, black, with, a, blue, cere, and, the, feet, are, white, with, black, talons, on, the, underside, of, the, wings, the, wrists, are, black, which, serves, as, a, field, mark, a, short, tail, and, long, narrow, wings, with, four, long, finger, like, feathers, and, a, shorter, fifth, give, it, a, very, distinctive, appearance, the, sexes, appear, fairly, similar, but, the, adult, male, can, be, distinguished, from, the, female, by, its, slimmer, body, and, narrower, wings, the, breast, band, of, the, male, is, also, weaker, than, that, of, the, female, or, is, non, existent, and, the, underwing, coverts, of, the, male, are, more, uniformly, pale, it, is, straightforward, to, determine, the, sex, in, a, breeding, pair, but, harder, with, individual, birds, the, juvenile, osprey, may, be, identified, by, buff, fringes, to, the, plumage, of, the, upperparts, a, buff, tone, to, the, underparts, and, streaked, feathers, on, the, head, during, spring, barring, on, the, underwings, and, flight, feathers, is, a, better, indicator, of, a, young, bird, due, to, wear, on, the, upperparts, in, flight, the, osprey, has, arched, wings, and, drooping, hands, giving, it, a, gull, like, appearance, the, call, is, a, series, of, sharp, whistles, described, as, cheep, cheep, or, yewk, yewk, if, disturbed, by, activity, near, the, nest, the, call, is, a, frenzied, cheereek, osprey, call, the, osprey, is, the, second, most, widely, distributed, raptor, species, after, the, peregrine, falcon, and, is, one, of, only, six, land, birds, with, a, worldwide, distribution, it, is, found, in, temperate, and, tropical, regions, of, all, continents, except, antarctica, in, north, america, it, breeds, from, alaska, and, newfoundland, south, to, the, gulf, coast, and, florida, wintering, further, south, from, the, southern, united, states, through, to, argentina, it, is, found, in, summer, throughout, europe, north, into, ireland, scandinavia, finland, and, great, britain, though, not, iceland, and, winters, in, north, africa, in, australia, it, is, mainly, sedentary, and, found, patchily, around, the, coastline, though, it, is, a, non, breeding, visitor, to, eastern, victoria, and, tasmania, there, is, a, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, gap, corresponding, with, the, coast, of, the, nullarbor, plain, between, its, westernmost, breeding, site, in, south, australia, and, the, nearest, breeding, sites, to, the, west, in, western, australia, in, the, islands, of, the, pacific, it, is, found, in, the, bismarck, islands, solomon, islands, and, new, caledonia, and, fossil, remains, of, adults, and, juveniles, have, been, found, in, tonga, where, it, probably, was, wiped, out, by, arriving, humans, it, is, possible, it, may, once, have, ranged, across, vanuatu, and, fiji, as, well, it, is, an, uncommon, to, fairly, common, winter, visitor, to, all, parts, of, south, asia, and, southeast, asia, from, myanmar, through, to, indochina, and, southern, china, indonesia, malaysia, and, the, philippines, the, osprey, is, piscivorous, with, fish, making, up, 99, of, its, diet, it, typically, takes, live, fish, weighing, 150, 300, g, 5, 3, 10, 6, oz, and, about, 25, 35, cm, 9, 8, 13, 8, in, in, length, but, virtually, any, type, of, fish, from, 50, g, 1, 8, oz, to, 2, kg, 4, 4, lb, can, be, taken, even, larger, 2, 8, kg, 6, 2, lb, northern, pike, esox, lucius, has, been, taken, in, russia, the, species, rarely, scavenges, dead, or, dying, fish, ospreys, have, a, vision, that, is, well, adapted, to, detecting, underwater, objects, from, the, air, prey, is, first, sighted, when, the, osprey, is, 10, 40, m, 33, 131, ft, above, the, water, after, which, the, bird, hovers, momentarily, and, then, plunges, feet, first, into, the, water, they, catch, fish, by, diving, into, a, body, of, water, oftentimes, completely, submerging, their, entire, bodies, as, an, osprey, dives, it, adjusts, the, angle, of, its, flight, to, account, for, the, distortion, of, the, fish, s, image, caused, by, refraction, ospreys, will, typically, eat, on, a, nearby, perch, but, have, also, been, known, to, carry, fish, for, longer, distances, occasionally, the, osprey, may, prey, on, rodents, rabbits, hares, other, mammals, snakes, turtles, frogs, birds, salamanders, conchs, and, crustaceans, reports, of, ospreys, feeding, on, carrion, are, rare, they, have, been, observed, eating, dead, white, tailed, deer, and, virginia, opossums, the, osprey, has, several, adaptations, that, suit, its, piscivorous, lifestyle, these, include, reversible, outer, toes, sharp, spicules, on, the, underside, of, the, toes, closable, nostrils, to, keep, out, water, during, dives, backward, facing, scales, on, the, talons, which, act, as, barbs, to, help, hold, its, catch, and, dense, plumage, which, is, oily, and, prevents, its, feathers, from, getting, waterlogged, the, osprey, breeds, near, freshwater, lakes, and, rivers, and, sometimes, on, coastal, brackish, waters, rocky, outcrops, just, offshore, are, used, in, rottnest, island, off, the, coast, of, western, australia, where, there, are, 14, or, so, similar, nesting, sites, of, which, five, to, seven, are, used, in, any, one, year, many, are, renovated, each, season, and, some, have, been, used, for, 70, years, the, nest, is, a, large, heap, of, sticks, driftwood, turf, or, seaweed, built, in, forks, of, trees, rocky, outcrops, utility, poles, artificial, platforms, or, offshore, islets, as, wide, as, 2, meters, and, weighing, about, 135, kg, 298, lb, large, nests, on, utility, poles, may, be, fire, hazards, and, have, caused, power, outages, generally, ospreys, reach, sexual, maturity, and, begin, breeding, around, the, age, of, three, to, four, though, in, some, regions, with, high, osprey, densities, such, as, chesapeake, bay, in, the, united, states, they, may, not, start, breeding, until, five, to, seven, years, old, and, there, may, be, a, shortage, of, suitable, tall, structures, if, there, are, no, nesting, sites, available, young, ospreys, may, be, forced, to, delay, breeding, to, ease, this, problem, posts, are, sometimes, erected, to, provide, more, sites, suitable, for, nest, building, the, nesting, platform, design, developed, by, the, organization, citizens, united, to, protect, the, maurice, river, and, its, tributaries, inc, has, become, the, official, design, of, the, state, of, new, jersey, u, s, the, nesting, platform, plans, and, materials, list, available, online, have, been, utilized, by, people, from, a, number, of, different, geographical, regions, there, is, a, global, site, for, mapping, osprey, nest, locations, and, logging, observations, on, reproductive, success, ospreys, usually, mate, for, life, rarely, polyandry, has, been, recorded, the, breeding, season, varies, according, to, latitude, spring, september, october, in, southern, australia, april, to, july, in, northern, australia, and, winter, june, august, in, southern, queensland, in, spring, the, pair, begins, a, five, month, period, of, partnership, to, raise, their, young, the, female, lays, two, to, four, eggs, within, a, month, and, relies, on, the, size, of, the, nest, to, conserve, heat, the, eggs, are, whitish, with, bold, splotches, of, reddish, brown, and, are, about, 6, 2, cm, 4, 5, cm, 2, 4, in, 1, 8, in, and, weigh, about, 65, g, 2, 3, oz, the, eggs, are, incubated, for, about, 35, 43, days, to, hatching, the, newly, hatched, chicks, weigh, only, 50, 60, g, 1, 8, 2, 1, oz, but, fledge, in, 8, 10, weeks, a, study, on, kangaroo, island, south, australia, had, an, average, time, between, hatching, and, fledging, of, 69, days, the, same, study, found, an, average, of, 0, 66, young, fledged, per, year, per, occupied, territory, and, 0, 92, young, fledged, per, year, per, active, nest, some, 22, of, surviving, young, either, remained, on, the, island, or, returned, at, maturity, to, join, the, breeding, population, when, food, is, scarce, the, first, chicks, to, hatch, are, most, likely, to, survive, the, typical, lifespan, is, 7, 10, years, though, rarely, individuals, can, grow, to, as, old, as, 20, 25, years, the, oldest, european, wild, osprey, on, record, lived, to, be, over, thirty, years, of, age, european, breeders, winter, in, africa, american, and, canadian, breeders, winter, in, south, america, although, some, stay, in, the, southernmost, u, s, states, such, as, florida, and, california, some, ospreys, from, florida, migrate, to, south, america, australasian, ospreys, tend, not, to, migrate, studies, of, swedish, ospreys, showed, that, females, tend, to, migrate, to, africa, earlier, than, males, more, stopovers, are, made, during, their, autumn, migration, the, variation, of, timing, and, duration, in, autumn, was, more, variable, than, in, spring, although, migrating, predominantly, during, the, day, they, sometimes, fly, in, the, dark, hours, particularly, in, crossings, over, water, and, cover, on, average, 260, 280, km, 160, 170, mi, per, day, with, a, maximum, of, 431, km, 268, mi, per, day, european, birds, may, also, winter, in, south, asia, as, indicated, by, an, osprey, tagged, in, norway, being, monitored, in, western, india, in, the, mediterranean, ospreys, show, partial, migratory, behaviour, with, some, individuals, remaining, resident, whilst, others, undertake, relatively, short, migration, trips, swedish, ospreys, have, a, significantly, higher, mortality, rate, during, migration, seasons, than, during, stationary, periods, with, more, than, half, of, the, total, annual, mortality, occurring, during, migration, these, deaths, can, also, be, categorized, into, spatial, patterns, spring, mortality, occurs, mainly, in, africa, which, can, be, traced, to, crossing, the, sahara, desert, mortality, can, also, occur, through, mishaps, with, human, utilities, such, as, nesting, near, overhead, electric, cables, or, collisions, with, aircraft, the, osprey, has, a, large, range, covering, 9, 670, 000, km, 2, 3, 730, 000, sq, mi, in, just, africa, and, the, americas, and, has, a, large, global, population, estimated, at, 460, 000, individuals, although, global, population, trends, have, not, been, quantified, the, species, is, not, believed, to, approach, the, thresholds, for, the, population, decline, criterion, of, the, iucn, red, list, i, e, declining, more, than, 30, in, ten, years, or, three, generations, and, for, these, reasons, the, species, is, evaluated, as, least, concern, there, is, evidence, for, regional, decline, in, south, australia, where, former, territories, at, locations, in, the, spencer, gulf, and, along, the, lower, murray, river, have, been, vacant, for, decades, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, main, threats, to, osprey, populations, were, egg, collectors, and, hunting, of, the, adults, along, with, other, birds, of, prey, but, osprey, populations, declined, drastically, in, many, areas, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, this, appeared, to, be, in, part, due, to, the, toxic, effects, of, insecticides, such, as, ddt, on, reproduction, the, pesticide, interfered, with, the, bird, s, calcium, metabolism, which, resulted, in, thin, shelled, easily, broken, or, infertile, eggs, possibly, because, of, the, banning, of, ddt, in, many, countries, in, the, early, 1970s, together, with, reduced, persecution, the, osprey, as, well, as, other, affected, bird, of, prey, species, have, made, significant, recoveries, in, south, australia, nesting, sites, on, the, eyre, peninsula, and, kangaroo, island, are, vulnerable, to, unmanaged, coastal, recreation, and, encroaching, urban, development, i, think, he, ll, be, to, rome, as, is, the, osprey, to, the, fish, who, takes, it, by, sovereignty, of, nature, the, seattle,

century, and, used, in, hats, including, those, used, as, part, of, the, army, uniform, despite, their, name, these, plumes, were, actually, obtained, from, egrets, during, the, 2017, regular, session, of, the, oregon, legislature, there, was, a, short, lived, controversy, over, the, western, meadowlark, s, status, as, the, state, bird, versus, the, osprey, the, sometimes, spirited, debate, included, state, representative, rich, vial, playing, the, meadowlark, s, song, on, his, smartphone, over, the, house, microphone, a, compromise, was, reached, in, scr, 18, which, was, passed, on, the, last, day, of, the, session, designating, the, western, meadowlark, as, the, state, songbird, and, the, osprey, as, the, state, raptor
