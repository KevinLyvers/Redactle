the, vicu, a, lama, vicugna, or, vicuna, both, v, k, u, n, j, very, rarely, spelled, vicugna, its, former, genus, name, is, one, of, the, two, wild, south, american, camelids, which, live, in, the, high, alpine, areas, of, the, andes, the, other, being, the, guanaco, which, lives, at, lower, elevations, vicu, as, are, relatives, of, the, llama, and, are, now, believed, to, be, the, wild, ancestor, of, domesticated, alpacas, which, are, raised, for, their, coats, vicu, as, produce, small, amounts, of, extremely, fine, wool, which, is, very, expensive, because, the, animal, can, only, be, shorn, every, three, years, and, has, to, be, caught, from, the, wild, when, knitted, together, the, product, of, the, vicu, a, s, wool, is, very, soft, and, warm, the, inca, valued, vicu, as, highly, for, their, wool, and, it, was, against, the, law, for, anyone, but, royalty, to, wear, vicu, a, garments, today, the, vicu, a, is, the, national, animal, of, peru, and, appears, on, the, peruvian, coat, of, arms, both, under, the, rule, of, the, inca, and, today, vicu, as, have, been, protected, by, law, but, they, were, heavily, hunted, in, the, intervening, period, when, they, were, declared, endangered, in, 1974, only, about, 6, 000, animals, were, left, today, the, vicu, a, population, has, recovered, to, about, 350, 000, and, although, conservation, organizations, have, reduced, its, level, of, threat, classification, they, still, call, for, active, conservation, programs, to, protect, populations, from, poaching, habitat, loss, and, other, threats, previously, the, vicu, a, was, not, considered, domesticated, and, the, llama, and, the, alpaca, were, regarded, as, descendants, of, the, closely, related, guanaco, however, dna, research, published, in, 2001, has, demonstrated, that, the, alpaca, may, have, vicu, a, parentage, today, the, vicu, a, is, mainly, wild, but, the, local, people, still, perform, special, rituals, with, these, creatures, including, a, fertility, rite, the, vicu, a, is, considered, more, delicate, and, gracile, than, the, guanaco, and, smaller, a, key, distinguishing, element, of, morphology, is, the, better, developed, incisor, roots, for, the, guanaco, the, vicu, a, s, long, woolly, coat, is, tawny, brown, on, the, back, whereas, the, hair, on, the, throat, and, chest, is, white, and, quite, long, its, head, is, slightly, shorter, than, guanaco, s, and, the, ears, are, slightly, longer, the, length, of, the, head, and, body, ranges, from, 1, 45, to, 1, 60, m, about, 5, ft, shoulder, height, is, from, 75, to, 85, cm, around, 3, ft, its, weight, is, from, 35, to, 65, kg, under, 150, lb, it, falls, prey, to, the, cougar, and, culpeo, there, are, two, subspecies, of, vicu, a, while, vicu, as, are, restricted, to, the, more, extreme, elevations, of, the, andes, in, modern, times, they, may, have, also, been, present, in, the, lowland, regions, of, patagonia, as, much, as, 3500, km, south, of, their, current, range, during, the, late, pleistocene, and, early, holocene, fossils, of, these, lowland, camelids, have, been, assigned, to, a, species, known, as, lama, gracilis, but, genetic, and, morphological, analysis, between, them, and, modern, vicu, a, indicate, the, two, may, be, the, same, vicu, as, are, native, to, south, america, s, central, andes, they, are, found, in, peru, northwestern, argentina, bolivia, and, northern, chile, a, smaller, introduced, population, lives, in, central, ecuador, vicu, as, live, at, altitudes, of, 3, 200, to, 4, 800, m, 10, 500, 15, 700, ft, they, feed, in, the, daytime, on, the, grassy, plains, of, the, andes, mountains, but, spend, the, nights, on, the, slopes, in, these, areas, only, nutrient, poor, tough, bunch, grasses, and, festuca, grow, the, sun, s, rays, can, penetrate, the, thin, atmosphere, producing, relatively, warm, temperatures, during, the, day, however, the, temperatures, drop, to, freezing, at, night, the, vicu, a, s, thick, but, soft, coat, is, a, unique, adaptation, that, traps, layers, of, warm, air, close, to, its, body, to, tolerate, freezing, temperatures, chief, predators, include, pumas, and, the, culpeo, the, behavior, of, vicu, as, is, similar, to, that, of, the, guanacos, they, are, timid, animals, and, are, easily, aroused, by, intruders, due, among, other, things, to, their, extraordinary, hearing, like, the, guanacos, they, frequently, lick, calcareous, stones, and, rocks, which, together, with, salt, water, is, its, source, of, salt, vicu, as, are, clean, animals, and, always, deposit, their, excrement, in, the, same, place, their, diets, consist, mainly, of, low, grasses, which, grow, in, clumps, on, the, ground, vicu, as, live, in, family, based, groups, of, a, male, 5, to, 15, females, and, their, young, each, group, has, its, territory, of, about, 18, km, 2, 6, 9, sq, mi, which, can, fluctuate, depending, on, food, availability, mating, usually, occurs, in, march, april, and, after, a, gestation, about, 11, months, the, female, gives, birth, to, a, single, fawn, which, is, nursed, for, about, ten, months, the, fawn, becomes, independent, at, about, 12, to, 18, months, old, young, males, form, bachelor, groups, and, the, young, females, search, for, a, sorority, to, join, this, deters, intraspecific, competition, and, inbreeding, until, 1964, hunting, of, the, vicu, a, was, unrestricted, which, reduced, its, numbers, to, only, 6, 000, in, the, 1960s, as, a, result, the, species, was, declared, endangered, in, 1974, and, its, status, prohibited, the, trade, of, vicu, a, wool, in, peru, during, 1964, 1966, the, servicio, forestal, y, de, caza, in, cooperation, with, the, us, peace, corps, nature, conservancy, world, wildlife, fund, and, the, national, agrarian, university, of, la, molina, established, a, nature, conservatory, for, the, vicu, a, called, the, pampa, galeras, barbara, d, achille, in, lucanas, province, ayacucho, during, that, time, a, game, warden, academy, was, held, in, nazca, where, eight, men, from, peru, and, six, from, bolivia, were, trained, to, protect, the, vicu, a, from, poaching, to, cooperate, on, the, conservation, of, the, vicu, a, the, governments, of, bolivia, and, peru, signed, the, convention, for, the, conservation, of, the, vicu, a, on, 16, august, 1969, in, la, paz, explicitly, leaving, the, treaty, open, to, accession, by, argentina, and, chile, ecuador, acceded, on, 11, february, 1976, the, convention, prohibited, their, international, trade, and, domestic, exploitation, and, ordered, the, parties, to, create, reserves, and, breeding, centres, a, follow, up, treaty, the, convention, for, the, conservation, and, management, of, the, vicu, a, was, signed, between, bolivia, chile, ecuador, and, peru, on, 20, december, 1979, in, lima, it, explicitly, allowed, only, argentina, to, sign, it, if, it, also, signed, the, 1969, la, paz, convention, article, 12, argentina, joined, in, 1981, and, did, not, allow, other, countries, to, accede, to, the, convention, due, to, its, specific, character, article, 13, the, 1979, convention, did, allow, the, use, of, the, vicu, a, under, strict, circumstances, if, the, animal, population, had, recovered, sufficiently, in, combination, with, cites, effective, in, 1975, as, well, as, usa, and, eu, trade, legislation, the, conventions, were, highly, successful, as, the, vicu, a, population, substantially, grew, as, a, result, the, estimated, population, in, peru, was, 66, 559, in, 1994, 103, 161, in, 1997, 118, 678, in, 2000, and, 208, 899, in, 2012, currently, the, community, of, lucanas, conducts, a, chaccu, herding, capturing, and, shearing, on, the, reserve, each, year, to, harvest, the, wool, organized, by, the, national, council, for, south, american, camelids, conacs, in, bolivia, the, ulla, ulla, national, reserve, was, founded, 1977, partly, as, a, sanctuary, for, the, species, their, numbers, grew, to, 125, 000, in, peru, chile, argentina, and, bolivia, since, this, was, a, ready, cash, crop, for, community, members, the, countries, relaxed, regulations, on, vicu, a, wool, in, 1993, enabling, its, trade, once, again, the, wool, is, sold, on, the, world, market, for, over, 300, per, kg, in, 2002, the, us, fish, and, wildlife, service, reclassified, most, populations, as, threatened, but, still, lists, ecuador, s, population, as, endangered, while, the, population, levels, have, recovered, to, a, healthy, level, poaching, remains, a, constant, threat, as, do, habitat, loss, and, other, threats, consequently, the, iucn, still, supports, active, conservation, programs, to, protect, vicu, as, though, they, lowered, their, status, to, least, concern, in, 2018, in, 2015, french, luxury, group, lvmh, said, that, loro, piana, saved, the, species, the, italian, company, has, been, criticized, for, underpaying, local, communities, collecting, the, wool, in, 2022, the, argentine, government, s, national, council, for, scientific, and, technical, investigation, estimated, that, andean, communities, receive, around, 3, of, the, value, generated, by, the, vicu, a, fiber, chain, its, wool, is, famous, for, its, warmth, and, is, used, for, apparel, such, as, socks, sweaters, accessories, shawls, coats, suits, and, home, furnishings, such, as, blankets, and, throws, its, properties, come, from, the, tiny, scales, on, the, hollow, air, filled, fibres, which, causes, them, to, interlock, and, trap, insulating, air, vicu, as, have, some, of, the, finest, fibers, in, the, world, at, a, diameter, of, 12, m, the, fiber, of, cashmere, goats, is, 14, to, 19, m, while, angora, rabbit, is, 8, to, 12, m, and, that, of, shahtoosh, from, the, tibetan, antelope, or, chiru, is, from, 9, to, 12, m
