the, avocado, alligator, pear, or, avocado, pear, persea, americana, is, an, evergreen, tree, in, the, laurel, family, lauraceae, it, is, native, to, the, americas, and, was, first, domesticated, in, mesoamerica, more, than, 5, 000, years, ago, it, was, prized, for, its, large, and, unusually, oily, fruit, the, tree, likely, originated, in, the, highlands, bridging, south, central, mexico, and, guatemala, avocado, trees, have, a, native, growth, range, from, mexico, to, costa, rica, its, fruit, sometimes, also, referred, to, as, an, alligator, pear, or, avocado, pear, is, botanically, a, large, berry, containing, a, single, large, seed, sequencing, of, its, genome, showed, that, the, evolution, of, avocados, was, shaped, by, polyploidy, events, and, that, commercial, varieties, have, an, hybrid, origin, avocado, trees, are, partly, self, pollinating, and, are, often, propagated, through, grafting, to, maintain, consistent, fruit, output, avocados, are, presently, cultivated, in, the, tropical, and, mediterranean, climates, of, many, countries, mexico, is, the, world, s, leading, producer, of, avocados, as, of, 2020, supplying, nearly, 30, of, the, global, harvest, in, that, year, the, fruit, of, domestic, varieties, have, smooth, buttery, golden, green, flesh, when, ripe, depending, on, the, cultivar, avocados, have, green, brown, purplish, or, black, skin, and, may, be, pear, shaped, egg, shaped, or, spherical, for, commercial, purposes, the, fruits, are, picked, while, unripe, and, ripened, after, harvesting, the, nutrient, density, and, extremely, high, fat, content, of, avocado, flesh, are, useful, to, a, variety, of, cuisines, and, are, often, eaten, to, enrich, vegetarian, diets, in, major, production, regions, like, chile, mexico, and, california, the, water, demands, of, avocado, farms, place, strain, on, local, resources, avocado, production, is, also, implicated, in, other, externalities, including, deforestation, and, human, rights, concerns, associated, with, the, partial, control, of, their, production, in, mexico, by, organized, crime, global, warming, is, expected, to, result, in, significant, changes, to, the, suitable, growing, zones, for, avocados, and, place, additional, pressures, on, the, locales, in, which, they, are, produced, due, to, heat, waves, and, drought, persea, americana, is, a, tree, that, grows, to, 9, 20, m, 30, 66, ft, with, a, trunk, diameter, between, 0, 3, 0, 6, m, 1, 2, ft, the, leaves, are, 8, 25, cm, 3, 10, in, long, and, alternately, arranged, panicles, of, flowers, with, deciduous, bracts, arise, from, new, growth, or, the, axils, of, leaves, the, tree, flowers, thousands, of, blossoms, every, year, avocado, blossoms, sprout, from, racemes, near, the, leaf, axils, they, are, small, and, inconspicuous, 5, 10, mm, 3, 16, 3, 8, in, wide, they, have, no, petals, but, instead, two, whorls, of, three, pale, green, or, greenish, yellow, downy, perianth, lobes, each, blossom, has, 9, stamens, with, 2, basal, orange, nectar, glands, the, avocado, fruit, is, a, climacteric, single, seeded, berry, due, to, the, imperceptible, endocarp, covering, the, seed, rather, than, a, drupe, the, pear, shaped, fruit, is, usually, 7, 20, cm, 3, 8, in, long, weighs, between, 100, and, 1, 000, g, 3, 1, 2, and, 35, 1, 2, oz, and, has, a, large, central, seed, 5, 6, 4, cm, 2, 2, 1, 2, in, long, the, species, produces, various, cultivars, with, larger, fleshier, fruits, with, a, thinner, exocarp, because, of, selective, breeding, by, humans, persea, americana, is, regarded, as, an, evolutionary, anachronism, having, likely, coevolved, dispersal, of, its, large, seed, by, now, extinct, megafauna, in, south, america, notably, giant, ground, sloths, and, the, gomphothere, genus, of, the, elephant, lineage, following, extinction, of, these, original, seed, dispersers, humans, migrating, into, the, region, are, thought, to, have, become, primary, long, distance, dispersers, eventuating, in, domestication, of, the, species, in, 1982, evolutionary, biologist, daniel, h, janzen, concluded, that, the, avocado, is, an, example, of, an, evolutionary, anachronism, a, fruit, adapted, for, ecological, relationship, with, now, extinct, large, mammals, such, as, giant, ground, sloths, or, gomphotheres, most, large, fleshy, fruits, serve, the, function, of, seed, dispersal, accomplished, by, their, consumption, by, large, animals, there, are, some, reasons, to, think, that, the, fruit, with, its, mildly, toxic, pit, may, have, coevolved, with, pleistocene, megafauna, to, be, swallowed, whole, and, excreted, in, their, dung, ready, to, sprout, no, extant, native, animal, is, large, enough, to, effectively, disperse, avocado, seeds, in, this, fashion, the, earliest, known, written, account, of, the, avocado, in, europe, is, that, of, mart, n, fern, ndez, de, enciso, c, 1470, 1528, in, 1519, in, his, book, suma, de, geographia, que, trata, de, todas, las, partidas, y, provincias, del, mundo, the, first, detailed, account, that, unequivocally, describes, the, avocado, was, given, by, gonzalo, fern, ndez, de, oviedo, y, vald, s, in, his, work, sumario, de, la, natural, historia, de, las, indias, in, 1526, the, first, written, record, in, english, of, the, use, of, the, word, avocado, was, by, hans, sloane, who, coined, the, term, in, a, 1696, index, of, jamaican, plants, the, word, avocado, comes, from, the, spanish, aguacate, which, derives, from, the, nahuatl, mexican, word, huacatl, which, goes, back, to, the, proto, aztecan, pa, wa, in, molina, s, nahuatl, dictionary, auacatl, is, given, also, as, the, translation, for, compa, n, testicle, and, this, has, been, taken, up, in, popular, culture, where, a, frequent, claim, is, that, testicle, was, the, word, s, original, meaning, this, is, not, the, case, as, the, original, meaning, can, be, reconstructed, as, avocado, rather, the, word, seems, to, have, been, used, in, nahuatl, as, a, euphemism, for, testicle, the, modern, english, name, comes, from, a, rendering, of, the, spanish, aguacate, as, avogato, the, earliest, known, written, use, in, english, is, attested, from, 1697, as, avogato, pear, later, avocado, pear, due, to, its, shape, a, term, sometimes, corrupted, to, alligator, pear, in, central, american, caribbean, spanish, speaking, countries, and, spain, it, is, known, by, the, mexican, spanish, name, aguacate, while, south, american, spanish, speaking, countries, argentina, chile, per, and, uruguay, use, a, quechua, derived, word, palta, in, portuguese, it, is, abacate, the, nahuatl, huacatl, can, be, compounded, with, other, words, as, in, ahuacamolli, meaning, avocado, soup, or, sauce, from, which, the, spanish, word, guacamole, derives, in, the, united, kingdom, the, term, avocado, pear, applied, when, avocados, first, became, commonly, available, in, the, 1960s, is, sometimes, used, originating, as, a, diminutive, in, australian, english, a, clipped, form, avo, has, since, become, a, common, colloquialism, in, south, africa, and, the, united, kingdom, it, is, known, as, butter, fruit, in, parts, of, india, and, hong, kong, domestication, leading, to, genetically, distinct, cultivars, possibly, originated, in, the, tehuacan, valley, in, the, state, of, puebla, mexico, there, is, evidence, for, three, possible, separate, domestications, of, the, avocado, resulting, in, the, currently, recognized, guatemalan, quilaoacatl, mexican, aoacatl, and, west, indian, tlacacolaocatl, landraces, the, guatemalan, and, mexican, and, landraces, originated, in, the, highlands, of, those, countries, while, the, west, indian, landrace, is, a, lowland, variety, that, ranges, from, guatemala, costa, rica, colombia, ecuador, to, peru, achieving, a, wide, range, through, human, agency, before, the, arrival, of, the, europeans, the, three, separate, landraces, were, most, likely, to, have, already, intermingled, in, pre, columbian, america, and, were, described, in, the, florentine, codex, the, earliest, residents, of, northern, coastal, peru, were, living, in, temporary, camps, in, an, ancient, wetland, and, eating, avocados, along, with, chilies, mollusks, sharks, birds, and, sea, lions, the, oldest, discovery, of, an, avocado, pit, comes, from, coxcatlan, cave, dating, from, around, 9, 000, to, 10, 000, years, ago, other, caves, in, the, tehuacan, valley, from, around, the, same, time, period, also, show, early, evidence, for, the, presence, and, consumption, of, avocado, there, is, evidence, for, avocado, use, at, norte, chico, civilization, sites, in, peru, by, at, least, 3, 200, years, ago, and, at, caballo, muerto, in, peru, from, around, 3, 800, to, 4, 500, years, ago, the, avocado, tree, also, has, a, long, history, of, cultivation, in, central, and, south, america, likely, beginning, as, early, as, 5, 000, bc, a, water, jar, shaped, like, an, avocado, dating, to, ad, 900, was, discovered, in, the, pre, inca, city, of, chan, chan, the, plant, was, introduced, to, spain, in, 1601, indonesia, around, 1750, mauritius, in, 1780, brazil, in, 1809, the, united, states, mainland, in, 1825, south, africa, and, australia, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1908, in, the, united, states, the, avocado, was, introduced, to, florida, and, hawaii, in, 1833, and, in, california, in, 1856, the, name, avocado, has, been, used, in, english, since, at, least, 1764, with, minor, spelling, variants, such, as, avogato, attested, even, earlier, the, avocado, was, commonly, referred, to, in, california, as, ahuacate, and, in, florida, as, alligator, pear, until, 1915, when, the, california, avocado, association, popularized, the, term, avocado, as, a, subtropical, species, avocados, need, a, climate, without, frost, and, with, little, wind, high, winds, reduce, the, humidity, dehydrate, the, flowers, and, affect, pollination, when, even, a, mild, frost, occurs, premature, fruit, drop, may, occur, although, the, hass, cultivar, can, tolerate, temperatures, down, to, 1, c, several, cold, hardy, varieties, are, planted, in, the, region, of, gainesville, florida, which, survive, temperatures, as, low, as, 6, 5, c, 20, f, with, only, minor, leaf, damage, the, trees, also, need, well, aerated, soils, ideally, more, than, 1, m, deep, however, guatemalan, varieties, such, as, macarthur, rincon, or, nabal, can, withstand, temperatures, down, to, 1, 6, c, 29, f, according, to, information, published, by, the, water, footprint, network, it, takes, an, average, of, approximately, 70, litres, 18, us, gallons, 15, imperial, gallons, of, applied, fresh, ground, or, surface, water, not, including, rainfall, or, natural, moisture, in, the, soil, to, grow, one, avocado, 283, l, kg, however, the, amount, of, water, needed, depends, on, where, it, is, grown, for, example, in, the, main, avocado, growing, region, of, chile, about, 320, l, 85, us, gal, 70, imp, gal, of, applied, water, are, needed, to, grow, one, avocado, 1, 280, l, kg, increasing, demand, and, production, of, avocados, may, cause, water, shortages, in, some, avocado, production, areas, such, as, the, mexican, state, of, michoac, n, avocados, may, also, cause, environmental, and, socioeconomic, impacts, in, major, production, areas, illegal, deforestation, and, water, disputes, water, requirements, for, growing, avocados, are, three, times, higher, than, for, apples, and, 18, times, higher, than, for, tomatoes, commercial, orchards, produce, an, average, of, seven, tonnes, per, hectare, each, year, with, some, orchards, achieving, 20, tonnes, per, hectare, biennial, bearing, can, be, a, problem, with, heavy, crops, in, one, year, being, followed, by, poor, yields, the, next, like, the, banana, the, avocado, is, a, climacteric, fruit, which, matures, on, the, tree, but, ripens, off, the, tree, avocados, used, in, commerce, are, picked, hard, and, green, and, kept, in, coolers, at, 3, 3, to, 5, 6, c, 37, 9, to, 42, 1, f, until, they, reach, their, final, destination, avocados, must, be, mature, to, ripen, properly, avocados, that, fall, off, the, tree, ripen, on, the, ground, generally, the, fruit, is, picked, once, it, reaches, maturity, mexican, growers, pick, hass, avocados, when, they, have, more, than, 23, dry, matter, and, other, producing, countries, have, similar, standards, once, picked, avocados, ripen, in, one, to, two, weeks, depending, on, the, cultivar, at, room, temperature, faster, if, stored, with, other, fruits, such, as, apples, or, bananas, because, of, the, influence, of, ethylene, gas, some, supermarkets, sell, ripened, avocados, which, have, been, treated, with, synthetic, ethylene, to, hasten, ripening, the, use, of, an, ethylene, gas, ripening, room, which, is, now, an, industry, standard, was, pioneered, in, the, 1980s, by, farmer, gil, henry, of, escondido, california, in, response, to, footage, from, a, hidden, supermarket, camera, which, showed, shoppers, repeatedly, squeezing, hard, unripe, avocados, putting, them, back, in, the, bin, and, moving, on, without, making, a, purchase, in, some, cases, avocados, can, be, left, on, the, tree, for, several, months, which, is, an, advantage, to, commercial, growers, who, seek, the, greatest, return, for, their, crop, but, if, the, fruit, remains, unpicked, for, too, long, it, falls, to, the, ground, the, species, is, only, partially, able, to, self, pollinate, because, of, dichogamy, in, its, flowering, this, limitation, added, to, the, long, juvenile, period, makes, the, species, difficult, to, breed, most, cultivars, are, propagated, by, grafting, having, originated, from, random, seedling, plants, or, minor, mutations, derived, from, cultivars, modern, breeding, programs, tend, to, use, isolation, plots, where, the, chances, of, cross, pollination, are, reduced, that, is, the, case, for, programs, at, the, university, of, california, riverside, as, well, as, the, volcani, centre, and, the, instituto, de, investigaciones, agropecuarias, in, chile, the, avocado, is, unusual, in, that, the, timing, of, the, male, and, female, flower, phases, differs, among, cultivars, the, two, flowering, types, are, a, and, b, a, cultivar, flowers, open, as, female, on, the, morning, of, the, first, day, and, close, in, late, morning, or, early, afternoon, then, they, open, as, male, in, the, afternoon, of, the, second, day, b, varieties, open, as, female, on, the, afternoon, of, the, first, day, close, in, late, afternoon, and, reopen, as, male, the, following, morning, certain, cultivars, such, as, the, hass, have, a, tendency, to, bear, well, only, in, alternate, years, after, a, season, with, a, low, yield, due, to, factors, such, as, cold, which, the, avocado, does, not, tolerate, well, the, trees, tend, to, produce, abundantly, the, next, season, in, addition, due, to, environmental, circumstances, during, some, years, seedless, avocados, may, appear, on, the, trees, known, in, the, avocado, industry, as, cukes, they, are, usually, discarded, commercially, due, to, their, small, size, avocados, can, be, propagated, by, seed, taking, roughly, four, to, six, years, to, bear, fruit, although, in, some, cases, seedlings, can, take, 10, years, to, come, into, bearing, the, offspring, is, unlikely, to, be, identical, to, the, parent, cultivar, in, fruit, quality, prime, quality, varieties, are, therefore, propagated, by, grafting, to, rootstocks, that, are, propagated, by, seed, seedling, rootstocks, or, by, layering, clonal, rootstocks, after, about, a, year, of, growing, in, a, greenhouse, the, young, rootstocks, are, ready, to, be, grafted, terminal, and, lateral, grafting, is, normally, used, the, scion, cultivar, grows, for, another, 6, 12, months, before, the, tree, is, ready, to, be, sold, clonal, rootstocks, are, selected, for, tolerance, of, specific, soil, and, disease, conditions, such, as, poor, soil, aeration, or, resistance, to, the, soil, borne, disease, root, rot, caused, by, phytophthora, cinnamomi, advances, in, cloning, techniques, that, can, produce, up, to, 500, new, plants, from, a, single, millimetre, of, tree, cutting, have, the, potential, to, increase, the, availability, of, rootstocks, commercial, avocado, production, is, limited, to, a, small, fraction, of, the, vast, genetic, diversity, in, the, species, conservation, of, this, genetic, diversity, has, relied, largely, on, field, collection, as, avocado, seeds, often, do, not, survive, storage, in, seed, banks, this, is, problematic, as, field, preservation, of, living, cultivars, is, expensive, and, habitat, loss, threatens, wild, cultivars, more, recently, an, alternate, method, of, conservation, has, been, developed, based, on, cryopreservation, of, avocado, somatic, embryos, with, reliable, methods, for, somatic, embryogenesis, and, reconstitution, into, living, trees, the, avocado, tree, can, be, grown, domestically, and, used, as, a, decorative, houseplant, the, pit, germinates, in, normal, soil, conditions, or, partially, submerged, in, a, small, glass, or, container, of, water, in, the, latter, method, the, pit, sprouts, in, four, to, six, weeks, at, which, time, it, is, planted, in, standard, houseplant, potting, soil, the, plant, normally, grows, large, enough, to, be, prunable, it, does, not, bear, fruit, unless, it, has, ample, sunlight, home, gardeners, can, graft, a, branch, from, a, fruit, bearing, plant, to, speed, maturity, which, typically, takes, four, to, six, years, to, bear, fruit, avocado, trees, are, vulnerable, to, bacterial, viral, fungal, and, nutritional, diseases, excesses, and, deficiencies, of, key, minerals, disease, can, affect, all, parts, of, the, plant, causing, spotting, rotting, cankers, pitting, and, discoloration, the, pyriform, scale, insect, protopulvinaria, pyriformis, is, known, from, australia, south, africa, israel, italy, france, spain, cuba, florida, and, peru, it, is, normally, found, on, avocado, and, in, peru, it, is, said, to, be, the, worst, insect, pest, of, the, fruit, certain, cultivars, of, avocado, seem, more, susceptible, to, attack, by, the, scale, than, others, mexico, is, by, far, the, world, s, largest, avocado, growing, country, producing, several, times, more, than, the, second, largest, producer, in, 2013, the, total, area, dedicated, to, avocado, production, was, 188, 723, hectares, 466, 340, acres, and, the, harvest, was, 2, 03, million, tonnes, in, 2017, the, states, that, produce, the, most, are, m, xico, morelos, nayarit, puebla, and, michoacan, accounting, for, 86, of, the, total, in, michoac, n, the, cultivation, is, complicated, by, the, existence, of, drug, cartels, that, extort, protection, fees, from, cultivators, they, are, reported, to, exact, 2, 000, mexican, pesos, per, hectare, from, avocado, farmers, and, 1, to, 3, pesos, kg, of, harvested, fruit, it, is, such, a, problem, that, the, phrase, blood, guacamole, has, been, adopted, to, describe, the, social, effects, in, mexico, of, the, vast, worldwide, demand, for, its, fruits, avocados, were, introduced, to, california, from, nicaragua, in, the, early, 1850s, when, avocado, trees, imported, from, the, central, american, country, were, observed, and, reported, growing, near, san, gabriel, the, avocado, has, since, become, a, successful, cash, crop, about, 24, 000, hectares, 59, 000, acres, as, of, 2015, some, 80, of,

facilitating, avocado, shipments, within, the, north, american, free, trade, zone, the, mexican, domestic, market, was, expanding, during, 2020, mexican, avocado, exports, are, challenged, by, growth, of, production, by, peru, and, the, dominican, republic, to, supply, the, us, and, european, markets, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, mexican, avocado, farmers, restricted, harvesting, as, the, overall, demand, and, supply, chain, slowed, due, to, labor, and, shipping, restrictions, later, in, 2020, demand, in, the, united, states, and, within, mexico, increased, at, a, time, when, american, retail, prices, continued, to, rise, during, 2020, in, the, united, states, month, to, month, volume, sales, of, avocados, were, similar, to, those, of, tomatoes, at, about, 250, million, pounds, 110, million, kg, per, month, a, report, issued, in, mid, 2020, forecast, that, the, worldwide, market, which, was, us, 13, 7, billion, in, 2018, would, recover, after, the, end, of, the, pandemic, and, rise, to, us, 21, 6, billion, by, 2026, some, people, have, allergic, reactions, to, avocado, there, are, two, main, forms, of, allergy, those, with, a, tree, pollen, allergy, develop, local, symptoms, in, the, mouth, and, throat, shortly, after, eating, avocado, the, second, known, as, latex, fruit, syndrome, is, related, to, latex, allergy, and, symptoms, include, generalised, urticaria,
