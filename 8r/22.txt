genetic, drift, also, known, as, random, genetic, drift, allelic, drift, or, the, wright, effect, is, the, change, in, the, frequency, of, an, existing, gene, variant, allele, in, a, population, due, to, random, chance, genetic, drift, may, cause, gene, variants, to, disappear, completely, and, thereby, reduce, genetic, variation, it, can, also, cause, initially, rare, alleles, to, become, much, more, frequent, and, even, fixed, when, few, copies, of, an, allele, exist, the, effect, of, genetic, drift, is, more, notable, and, when, many, copies, exist, the, effect, is, less, notable, due, to, the, law, of, large, numbers, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, vigorous, debates, occurred, over, the, relative, importance, of, natural, selection, versus, neutral, processes, including, genetic, drift, ronald, fisher, who, explained, natural, selection, using, mendelian, genetics, held, the, view, that, genetic, drift, plays, at, most, a, minor, role, in, evolution, and, this, remained, the, dominant, view, for, several, decades, in, 1968, population, geneticist, motoo, kimura, rekindled, the, debate, with, his, neutral, theory, of, molecular, evolution, which, claims, that, most, instances, where, a, genetic, change, spreads, across, a, population, although, not, necessarily, changes, in, phenotypes, are, caused, by, genetic, drift, acting, on, neutral, mutations, in, the, 1990s, constructive, neutral, evolution, was, proposed, which, seeks, to, explain, how, complex, systems, emerge, through, neutral, transitions, the, process, of, genetic, drift, can, be, illustrated, using, 20, marbles, in, a, jar, to, represent, 20, organisms, in, a, population, consider, this, jar, of, marbles, as, the, starting, population, half, of, the, marbles, in, the, jar, are, red, and, half, are, blue, with, each, colour, corresponding, to, a, different, allele, of, one, gene, in, the, population, in, each, new, generation, the, organisms, reproduce, at, random, to, represent, this, reproduction, randomly, select, a, marble, from, the, original, jar, and, deposit, a, new, marble, with, the, same, colour, into, a, new, jar, this, is, the, offspring, of, the, original, marble, meaning, that, the, original, marble, remains, in, its, jar, repeat, this, process, until, 20, new, marbles, are, in, the, second, jar, the, second, jar, will, now, contain, 20, offspring, or, marbles, of, various, colours, unless, the, second, jar, contains, exactly, 10, red, marbles, and, 10, blue, marbles, a, random, shift, has, occurred, in, the, allele, frequencies, if, this, process, is, repeated, a, number, of, times, the, numbers, of, red, and, blue, marbles, picked, each, generation, fluctuates, sometimes, a, jar, has, more, red, marbles, than, its, parent, jar, and, sometimes, more, blue, this, fluctuation, is, analogous, to, genetic, drift, a, change, in, the, population, s, allele, frequency, resulting, from, a, random, variation, in, the, distribution, of, alleles, from, one, generation, to, the, next, in, any, one, generation, no, marbles, of, a, particular, colour, could, be, chosen, meaning, they, have, no, offspring, in, this, example, if, no, red, marbles, are, selected, the, jar, representing, the, new, generation, contains, only, blue, offspring, if, this, happens, the, red, allele, has, been, lost, permanently, in, the, population, while, the, remaining, blue, allele, has, become, fixed, all, future, generations, are, entirely, blue, in, small, populations, fixation, can, occur, in, just, a, few, generations, the, mechanisms, of, genetic, drift, can, be, illustrated, with, a, very, simple, example, consider, a, very, large, colony, of, bacteria, isolated, in, a, drop, of, solution, the, bacteria, are, genetically, identical, except, for, a, single, gene, with, two, alleles, labeled, a, and, b, which, are, neutral, alleles, meaning, that, they, do, not, affect, the, bacteria, s, ability, to, survive, and, reproduce, all, bacteria, in, this, colony, are, equally, likely, to, survive, and, reproduce, suppose, that, half, the, bacteria, have, allele, a, and, the, other, half, have, allele, b, thus, a, and, b, each, has, an, allele, frequency, of, 1, 2, the, drop, of, solution, then, shrinks, until, it, has, only, enough, food, to, sustain, four, bacteria, all, other, bacteria, die, without, reproducing, among, the, four, that, survive, 16, possible, combinations, for, the, a, and, b, alleles, exist, a, a, a, a, b, a, a, a, a, b, a, a, b, b, a, a, a, a, b, a, b, a, b, a, a, b, b, a, b, b, b, a, a, a, a, b, b, a, a, b, a, b, a, b, b, b, a, b, a, a, b, b, b, a, b, b, a, b, b, b, b, b, b, b, since, all, bacteria, in, the, original, solution, are, equally, likely, to, survive, when, the, solution, shrinks, the, four, survivors, are, a, random, sample, from, the, original, colony, the, probability, that, each, of, the, four, survivors, has, a, given, allele, is, 1, 2, and, so, the, probability, that, any, particular, allele, combination, occurs, when, the, solution, shrinks, is, the, original, population, size, is, so, large, that, the, sampling, effectively, happens, with, replacement, in, other, words, each, of, the, 16, possible, allele, combinations, is, equally, likely, to, occur, with, probability, 1, 16, counting, the, combinations, with, the, same, number, of, a, and, b, gives, the, following, table, as, shown, in, the, table, the, total, number, of, combinations, that, have, the, same, number, of, a, alleles, as, of, b, alleles, is, six, and, the, probability, of, this, combination, is, 6, 16, the, total, number, of, other, combinations, is, ten, so, the, probability, of, unequal, number, of, a, and, b, alleles, is, 10, 16, thus, although, the, original, colony, began, with, an, equal, number, of, a, and, b, alleles, quite, possibly, the, number, of, alleles, in, the, remaining, population, of, four, members, will, not, be, equal, the, situation, of, equal, numbers, is, actually, less, likely, than, unequal, numbers, in, the, latter, case, genetic, drift, has, occurred, because, the, population, s, allele, frequencies, have, changed, due, to, random, sampling, in, this, example, the, population, contracted, to, just, four, random, survivors, a, phenomenon, known, as, a, population, bottleneck, the, probabilities, for, the, number, of, copies, of, allele, a, or, b, that, survive, given, in, the, last, column, of, the, above, table, can, be, calculated, directly, from, the, binomial, distribution, where, the, success, probability, probability, of, a, given, allele, being, present, is, 1, 2, i, e, the, probability, that, there, are, k, copies, of, a, or, b, alleles, in, the, combination, is, given, by, where, n, 4, is, the, number, of, surviving, bacteria, mathematical, models, of, genetic, drift, can, be, designed, using, either, branching, processes, or, a, diffusion, equation, describing, changes, in, allele, frequency, in, an, idealised, population, consider, a, gene, with, two, alleles, a, or, b, in, diploidy, populations, consisting, of, n, individuals, have, 2, n, copies, of, each, gene, an, individual, can, have, two, copies, of, the, same, allele, or, two, different, alleles, the, frequency, of, one, allele, is, assigned, p, and, the, other, q, the, wright, fisher, model, named, after, sewall, wright, and, ronald, fisher, assumes, that, generations, do, not, overlap, for, example, annual, plants, have, exactly, one, generation, per, year, and, that, each, copy, of, the, gene, found, in, the, new, generation, is, drawn, independently, at, random, from, all, copies, of, the, gene, in, the, old, generation, the, formula, to, calculate, the, probability, of, obtaining, k, copies, of, an, allele, that, had, frequency, p, in, the, last, generation, is, then, where, the, symbol, signifies, the, factorial, function, this, expression, can, also, be, formulated, using, the, binomial, coefficient, the, moran, model, assumes, overlapping, generations, at, each, time, step, one, individual, is, chosen, to, reproduce, and, one, individual, is, chosen, to, die, so, in, each, timestep, the, number, of, copies, of, a, given, allele, can, go, up, by, one, go, down, by, one, or, can, stay, the, same, this, means, that, the, transition, matrix, is, tridiagonal, which, means, that, mathematical, solutions, are, easier, for, the, moran, model, than, for, the, wright, fisher, model, on, the, other, hand, computer, simulations, are, usually, easier, to, perform, using, the, wright, fisher, model, because, fewer, time, steps, need, to, be, calculated, in, the, moran, model, it, takes, n, timesteps, to, get, through, one, generation, where, n, is, the, effective, population, size, in, the, wright, fisher, model, it, takes, just, one, in, practice, the, moran, and, wright, fisher, models, give, qualitatively, similar, results, but, genetic, drift, runs, twice, as, fast, in, the, moran, model, if, the, variance, in, the, number, of, offspring, is, much, greater, than, that, given, by, the, binomial, distribution, assumed, by, the, wright, fisher, model, then, given, the, same, overall, speed, of, genetic, drift, the, variance, effective, population, size, genetic, drift, is, a, less, powerful, force, compared, to, selection, even, for, the, same, variance, if, higher, moments, of, the, offspring, number, distribution, exceed, those, of, the, binomial, distribution, then, again, the, force, of, genetic, drift, is, substantially, weakened, random, changes, in, allele, frequencies, can, also, be, caused, by, effects, other, than, sampling, error, for, example, random, changes, in, selection, pressure, one, important, alternative, source, of, stochasticity, perhaps, more, important, than, genetic, drift, is, genetic, draft, genetic, draft, is, the, effect, on, a, locus, by, selection, on, linked, loci, the, mathematical, properties, of, genetic, draft, are, different, from, those, of, genetic, drift, the, direction, of, the, random, change, in, allele, frequency, is, autocorrelated, across, generations, the, hardy, weinberg, principle, states, that, within, sufficiently, large, populations, the, allele, frequencies, remain, constant, from, one, generation, to, the, next, unless, the, equilibrium, is, disturbed, by, migration, genetic, mutations, or, selection, however, in, finite, populations, no, new, alleles, are, gained, from, the, random, sampling, of, alleles, passed, to, the, next, generation, but, the, sampling, can, cause, an, existing, allele, to, disappear, because, random, sampling, can, remove, but, not, replace, an, allele, and, because, random, declines, or, increases, in, allele, frequency, influence, expected, allele, distributions, for, the, next, generation, genetic, drift, drives, a, population, towards, genetic, uniformity, over, time, when, an, allele, reaches, a, frequency, of, 1, 100, it, is, said, to, be, fixed, in, the, population, and, when, an, allele, reaches, a, frequency, of, 0, 0, it, is, lost, smaller, populations, achieve, fixation, faster, whereas, in, the, limit, of, an, infinite, population, fixation, is, not, achieved, once, an, allele, becomes, fixed, genetic, drift, comes, to, a, halt, and, the, allele, frequency, cannot, change, unless, a, new, allele, is, introduced, in, the, population, via, mutation, or, gene, flow, thus, even, while, genetic, drift, is, a, random, directionless, process, it, acts, to, eliminate, genetic, variation, over, time, assuming, genetic, drift, is, the, only, evolutionary, force, acting, on, an, allele, after, t, generations, in, many, replicated, populations, starting, with, allele, frequencies, of, p, and, q, the, variance, in, allele, frequency, across, those, populations, is, assuming, genetic, drift, is, the, only, evolutionary, force, acting, on, an, allele, at, any, given, time, the, probability, that, an, allele, will, eventually, become, fixed, in, the, population, is, simply, its, frequency, in, the, population, at, that, time, for, example, if, the, frequency, p, for, allele, a, is, 75, and, the, frequency, q, for, allele, b, is, 25, then, given, unlimited, time, the, probability, a, will, ultimately, become, fixed, in, the, population, is, 75, and, the, probability, that, b, will, become, fixed, is, 25, the, expected, number, of, generations, for, fixation, to, occur, is, proportional, to, the, population, size, such, that, fixation, is, predicted, to, occur, much, more, rapidly, in, smaller, populations, normally, the, effective, population, size, which, is, smaller, than, the, total, population, is, used, to, determine, these, probabilities, the, effective, population, n, e, takes, into, account, factors, such, as, the, level, of, inbreeding, the, stage, of, the, lifecycle, in, which, the, population, is, the, smallest, and, the, fact, that, some, neutral, genes, are, genetically, linked, to, others, that, are, under, selection, the, effective, population, size, may, not, be, the, same, for, every, gene, in, the, same, population, one, forward, looking, formula, used, for, approximating, the, expected, time, before, a, neutral, allele, becomes, fixed, through, genetic, drift, according, to, the, wright, fisher, model, is, where, t, is, the, number, of, generations, n, e, is, the, effective, population, size, and, p, is, the, initial, frequency, for, the, given, allele, the, result, is, the, number, of, generations, expected, to, pass, before, fixation, occurs, for, a, given, allele, in, a, population, with, given, size, n, e, and, allele, frequency, p, the, expected, time, for, the, neutral, allele, to, be, lost, through, genetic, drift, can, be, calculated, as, when, a, mutation, appears, only, once, in, a, population, large, enough, for, the, initial, frequency, to, be, negligible, the, formulas, can, be, simplified, to, for, average, number, of, generations, expected, before, fixation, of, a, neutral, mutation, and, for, the, average, number, of, generations, expected, before, the, loss, of, a, neutral, mutation, in, a, population, of, actual, size, n, the, formulae, above, apply, to, an, allele, that, is, already, present, in, a, population, and, which, is, subject, to, neither, mutation, nor, natural, selection, if, an, allele, is, lost, by, mutation, much, more, often, than, it, is, gained, by, mutation, then, mutation, as, well, as, drift, may, influence, the, time, to, loss, if, the, allele, prone, to, mutational, loss, begins, as, fixed, in, the, population, and, is, lost, by, mutation, at, rate, m, per, replication, then, the, expected, time, in, generations, until, its, loss, in, a, haploid, population, is, given, by, where, displaystyle, gamma, is, euler, s, constant, the, first, approximation, represents, the, waiting, time, until, the, first, mutant, destined, for, loss, with, loss, then, occurring, relatively, rapidly, by, genetic, drift, taking, time, 1, m, n, e, the, second, approximation, represents, the, time, needed, for, deterministic, loss, by, mutation, accumulation, in, both, cases, the, time, to, fixation, is, dominated, by, mutation, via, the, term, 1, m, and, is, less, affected, by, the, effective, population, size, in, natural, populations, genetic, drift, and, natural, selection, do, not, act, in, isolation, both, phenomena, are, always, at, play, together, with, mutation, and, migration, neutral, evolution, is, the, product, of, both, mutation, and, drift, not, of, drift, alone, similarly, even, when, selection, overwhelms, genetic, drift, it, can, only, act, on, variation, that, mutation, provides, while, natural, selection, has, a, direction, guiding, evolution, towards, heritable, adaptations, to, the, current, environment, genetic, drift, has, no, direction, and, is, guided, only, by, the, mathematics, of, chance, as, a, result, drift, acts, upon, the, genotypic, frequencies, within, a, population, without, regard, to, their, phenotypic, effects, in, contrast, selection, favors, the, spread, of, alleles, whose, phenotypic, effects, increase, survival, and, or, reproduction, of, their, carriers, lowers, the, frequencies, of, alleles, that, cause, unfavorable, traits, and, ignores, those, that, are, neutral, the, law, of, large, numbers, predicts, that, when, the, absolute, number, of, copies, of, the, allele, is, small, e, g, in, small, populations, the, magnitude, of, drift, on, allele, frequencies, per, generation, is, larger, the, magnitude, of, drift, is, large, enough, to, overwhelm, selection, at, any, allele, frequency, when, the, selection, coefficient, is, less, than, 1, divided, by, the, effective, population, size, non, adaptive, evolution, resulting, from, the, product, of, mutation, and, genetic, drift, is, therefore, considered, to, be, a, consequential, mechanism, of, evolutionary, change, primarily, within, small, isolated, populations, the, mathematics, of, genetic, drift, depend, on, the, effective, population, size, but, it, is, not, clear, how, this, is, related, to, the, actual, number, of, individuals, in, a, population, genetic, linkage, to, other, genes, that, are, under, selection, can, reduce, the, effective, population, size, experienced, by, a, neutral, allele, with, a, higher, recombination, rate, linkage, decreases, and, with, it, this, local, effect, on, effective, population, size, this, effect, is, visible, in, molecular, data, as, a, correlation, between, local, recombination, rate, and, genetic, diversity, and, negative, correlation, between, gene, density, and, diversity, at, noncoding, dna, regions, stochasticity, associated, with, linkage, to, other, genes, that, are, under, selection, is, not, the, same, as, sampling, error, and, is, sometimes, known, as, genetic, draft, in, order, to, distinguish, it, from, genetic, drift, low, allele, frequency, makes, alleles, more, vulnerable, to, being, eliminated, by, random, chance, even, overriding, the, influence, of, natural, selection, for, example, while, disadvantageous, mutations, are, usually, eliminated, quickly, within, the, population, new, advantageous, mutations, are, almost, as, vulnerable, to, loss, through, genetic, drift, as, are, neutral, mutations, not, until, the, allele, frequency, for, the, advantageous, mutation, reaches, a, certain, threshold, will, genetic, drift, have, no, effect, a, population, bottleneck, is, when, a, population, contracts, to, a, significantly, smaller, size, over, a, short, period, of, time, due, to, some, random, environmental, event, in, a, true, population, bottleneck, the, odds, for, survival, of, any, member, of, the, population, are, purely, random, and, are, not, improved, by, any, particular, inherent, genetic, advantage, the, bottleneck, can, result, in, radical, changes, in, allele, frequencies, completely, independent, of, selection, the, impact, of, a, population, bottleneck, can, be, sustained, even, when, the, bottleneck, is, caused, by, a, one, time, event, such, as, a, natural, catastrophe, an, interesting, example, of, a, bottleneck, causing, unusual, genetic, distribution, is, the, relatively, high, proportion, of, individuals, with, total, rod, cell, color, blindness, achromatopsia, on, pingelap, atoll, in, micronesia, after, a, bottleneck, inbreeding, increases, this, increases, the, damage, done, by, recessive, deleterious, mutations, in, a, process, known, as, inbreeding, depression, the, worst, of, these, mutations, are, selected, against, leading, to, the, loss, of, other, alleles, that, are, genetically, linked, to, them, in, a, process, of, background, selection, for, recessive, harmful, mutations, this, selection, can, be, enhanced, as, a, consequence, of, the, bottleneck, due, to, genetic, purging, this, leads, to, a, further, loss, of, genetic, diversity, in, addition, a, sustained, reduction, in, population, size, increases, the, likelihood, of, further, allele, fluctuations, from, drift, in, generations, to, come, a, population, s, genetic, variation, can, be, greatly, reduced, by, a, bottleneck, and, even, beneficial, adaptations, may, be, permanently, eliminated, the, loss, of, variation, leaves, the, surviving, population, vulnerable, to, any, new, selection, pressures, such, as, disease, climatic, change, or, shift, in, the, available, food, source, because, adapting, in, response, to, environmental, changes, requires, sufficient, genetic, variation, in, the, population, for, natural, selection, to, take, place, there, have, been, many, known, cases, of, population, bottleneck, in, the, recent, past, prior, to, the, arrival, of, europeans, north, american, prairies, were, habitat, for, millions, of, greater, prairie, chickens, in, illinois, alone, their, numbers, plummeted, from, about, 100, million, birds, in, 1900, to, about, 50, birds, in, the, 1990s, the, declines, in, population, resulted, from, hunting, and, habitat, destruction, but, a, consequence, has, been, a, loss, of, most, of, the, species, genetic, diversity, dna, analysis, comparing, birds, from, the, mid, century, to, birds, in, the, 1990s, documents, a, steep, decline, in, the, genetic, variation, in, just, the, latter, few, decades, currently, the, greater, prairie, chicken, is, experiencing, low, reproductive, success, however, the, genetic, loss, caused, by, bottleneck, and, genetic, drift, can, increase, fitness, as, in, ehrlichia, over, hunting, also, caused, a, severe, population, bottleneck, in, the, northern, elephant, seal, in, the, 19th, century, their, resulting, decline, in, genetic, variation, can, be, deduced, by, comparing, it, to, that, of, the, southern, elephant, seal, which, were, not, so, aggressively, hunted, the, founder, effect, is, a, special, case, of, a, population, bottleneck, occurring, when, a, small, group, in, a, population, splinters, off, from, the, original, population, and, forms, a, new, one, the, random, sample, of, alleles, in, the, just, formed, new, colony, is, expected, to, grossly, misrepresent, the, original, population, in, at, least, some, respects, it, is, even, possible, that, the, number, of, alleles, for, some, genes, in, the, original, population, is, larger, than, the, number, of, gene, copies, in, the, founders, making, complete, representation, impossible, when, a, newly, formed, colony, is, small, its, founders, can, strongly, affect, the, population, s, genetic, make, up, far, into, the, future, a, well, documented, example, is, found, in, the, amish, migration, to, pennsylvania, in, 1744, two, members, of, the, new, colony, shared, the, recessive, allele, for, ellis, van, creveld, syndrome, members, of, the, colony, and, their, descendants, tend, to, be, religious, isolates, and, remain, relatively, insular, as, a, result, of, many, generations, of, inbreeding, ellis, van, creveld, syndrome, is, now, much, more, prevalent, among, the, amish, than, in, the, general, population, the, difference, in, gene, frequencies, between, the, original, population, and, colony, may, also, trigger, the, two, groups, to, diverge, significantly, over, the, course, of, many, generations, as, the, difference, or, genetic, distance, increases, the, two, separated, populations, may, become, distinct, both, genetically, and, phenetically, although, not, only, genetic, drift, but, also, natural, selection, gene, flow, and, mutation, contribute, to, this, divergence, this, potential, for, relatively, rapid, changes, in, the, colony, s, gene, frequency, led, most, scientists, to, consider, the, founder, effect, and, by, extension, genetic, drift, a, significant, driving, force, in, the, evolution, of, new, species, sewall, wright, was, the, first, to, attach, this, significance, to, random, drift, and, small, newly, isolated, populations, with, his, shifting, balance, theory, of, speciation, following, after, wright, ernst, mayr, created, many, persuasive, models, to, show, that, the, decline, in, genetic, variation, and, small, population, size, following, the, founder, effect, were, critically, important, for, new, species, to, develop, however, there, is, much, less, support, for, this, view, today, since, the, hypothesis, has, been, tested, repeatedly, through, experimental, research, and, the, results, have, been, equivocal, at, best, the, role, of, random, chance, in, evolution, was, first, outlined, by, arend, l, hagedoorn, and, anna, cornelia, hagedoorn, vorstheuvel, la, brand, in, 1921, they, highlighted, that, random, survival, plays, a, key, role, in, the, loss, of, variation, from, populations, fisher, 1922, responded, to, this, with, the, first, albeit, marginally, incorrect, mathematical, treatment, of, the, hagedoorn, effect, notably, he, expected, that, many, natural, populations, were, too, large, an, n, 10, 000, for, the, effects, of, drift, to, be, substantial, and, thought, drift, would, have, an, insignificant, effect, on, the, evolutionary, process, the, corrected, mathematical, treatment, and, term, genetic, drift, was, later, coined, by, a, founder, of, population, genetics, sewall, wright, his, first, use, of, the, term, drift, was, in, 1929, though, at, the, time, he, was, using, it, in, the, sense, of, a, directed, process, of, change, or, natural, selection, random, drift, by, means, of, sampling, error, came, to, be, known, as, the, sewall, wright, effect, though, he, was, never, entirely, comfortable, to, see, his, name, given, to, it, wright, referred, to, all, changes, in, allele, frequency, as, either, steady, drift, e, g, selection, or, random, drift, e, g, sampling, error, drift, came, to, be, adopted, as, a, technical, term, in, the, stochastic, sense, exclusively, today, it, is, usually, defined, still, more, narrowly, in, terms, of, sampling, error, although, this, narrow, definition, is, not, universal, wright, wrote, that, the, restriction, of, random, drift, or, even, drift, to, only, one, component, the, effects, of, accidents, of, sampling, tends, to, lead, to, confusion, sewall, wright, considered, the, process, of, random, genetic, drift, by, means, of, sampling, error, equivalent, to, that, by, means, of, inbreeding, but, later, work, has, shown, them, to, be, distinct, in, the, early, days, of, the, modern, evolutionary, synthesis, scientists, were, beginning, to, blend, the, new, science, of, population, genetics, with, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, natural, selection, within, this, framework, wright, focused, on, the, effects, of, inbreeding, on, small, relatively, isolated, populations, he, introduced, the, concept, of, an, adaptive, landscape, in, which, phenomena, such, as, cross, breeding, and, genetic, drift, in, small, populations, could, push, them, away, from, adaptive, peaks, which, in, turn, allow, natural, selection, to, push, them, towards, new, adaptive, peaks, wright, thought, smaller, populations, were, more, suited, for, natural, selection, because, inbreeding, was, sufficiently, intense, to, create, new, interaction, systems, through, random, drift, but, not, intense, enough, to, cause, random, nonadaptive, fixation, of, genes, wright, s, views, on, the, role, of, genetic, drift, in, the, evolutionary, scheme, were, controversial, almost, from, the, very, beginning, one, of, the, most, vociferous, and, influential, critics, was, colleague, ronald, fisher, fisher, conceded, genetic, drift, played, some, role, in, evolution, but, an, insignificant, one, fisher, has, been, accused, of, misunderstanding, wright, s, views, because, in, his, criticisms, fisher, seemed, to, argue, wright, had, rejected, selection, almost, entirely, to, fisher, viewing, the, process, of, evolution, as, a, long, steady, adaptive, progression, was, the, only, way, to, explain, the, ever, increasing, complexity, from, simpler, forms, but, the, debates, have, continued, between, the, gradualists, and, those, who, lean, more, toward, the, wright, model, of, evolution, where, selection, and, drift, together, play, an, important, role, in, 1968, motoo, kimura, rekindled, the, debate, with, his, neutral, theory, of, molecular, evolution, which, claims, that, most, of, the, genetic, changes, are, caused, by, genetic, drift, acting, on, neutral, mutations, the, role, of, genetic, drift, by, means, of, sampling, error, in, evolution, has, been, criticized, by, john, h, gillespie, and, william, b, provine, who, argue, that, selection, on, linked, sites, is, a, more, important, stochastic, force
