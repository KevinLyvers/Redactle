barley, hordeum, vulgare, a, member, of, the, grass, family, is, a, major, cereal, grain, grown, in, temperate, climates, globally, it, was, one, of, the, first, cultivated, grains, it, was, domesticated, in, the, fertile, crescent, around, 9000, bc, giving, it, nonshattering, spikelets, and, making, it, much, easier, to, harvest, its, use, then, spread, throughout, eurasia, by, 2000, bc, barley, prefers, relatively, low, temperatures, and, well, drained, soil, to, grow, it, is, relatively, tolerant, of, drought, and, soil, salinity, but, is, less, winter, hardy, than, wheat, or, rye, in, 2022, barley, was, fourth, among, grains, in, quantity, produced, 155, million, tonnes, behind, maize, wheat, and, rice, globally, 70, of, barley, production, is, used, as, animal, feed, while, 30, is, used, as, a, source, of, fermentable, material, for, beer, or, further, distilled, into, whisky, and, as, a, component, of, various, foods, it, is, used, in, soups, and, stews, and, in, barley, bread, of, various, cultures, barley, grains, are, commonly, made, into, malt, using, a, traditional, and, ancient, method, of, preparation, in, english, folklore, john, barleycorn, personifies, the, grain, and, the, alcoholic, beverages, made, from, it, english, pub, names, such, as, the, barley, mow, allude, to, its, role, in, the, production, of, beer, the, old, english, word, for, barley, was, bere, this, survives, in, the, north, of, scotland, as, bere, it, is, used, for, a, strain, of, six, row, barley, grown, there, modern, english, barley, derives, from, the, old, english, adjective, b, rlic, meaning, of, barley, the, word, barn, derives, from, old, english, bere, aern, meaning, barley, store, the, name, of, the, genus, is, from, latin, hordeum, barley, likely, related, to, latin, horrere, to, bristle, barley, is, a, cereal, a, member, of, the, grass, family, with, edible, grains, its, flowers, are, clusters, of, spikelets, arranged, in, a, distinctive, herringbone, pattern, each, spikelet, has, a, long, thin, awn, to, 160, mm, 6, 3, in, long, making, the, ears, look, tufted, the, spikelets, are, in, clusters, of, three, in, six, row, barley, all, three, spikelets, in, each, cluster, are, fertile, in, two, row, barley, only, the, central, one, is, fertile, it, is, a, self, pollinating, diploid, species, with, 14, chromosomes, the, genome, of, barley, was, sequenced, in, 2012, by, the, international, barley, genome, sequencing, consortium, and, the, uk, barley, sequencing, consortium, the, genome, is, organised, into, seven, pairs, of, nuclear, chromosomes, recommended, designations, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h, and, 7h, and, one, mitochondrial, and, one, chloroplast, chromosome, with, a, total, of, 5000, mbp, details, of, the, genome, are, freely, available, in, several, barley, databases, the, barley, genus, hordeum, is, relatively, closely, related, to, wheat, and, rye, within, the, triticeae, and, more, distantly, to, rice, within, the, bop, clade, of, grasses, poaceae, the, phylogeny, of, the, triticeae, is, complicated, by, horizontal, gene, transfer, between, species, so, there, is, a, network, of, relationships, rather, than, a, simple, inheritance, based, tree, bambusoideae, bamboos, fescue, ryegrass, hordeum, barley, triticum, wheat, secale, rye, oryza, rice, other, grasses, sorghum, sorghum, zea, maize, barley, was, one, of, the, first, grains, to, be, domesticated, in, the, fertile, crescent, an, area, of, relatively, abundant, water, in, western, asia, around, 9, 000, bc, wild, barley, h, vulgare, ssp, spontaneum, ranges, from, north, africa, and, crete, in, the, west, to, tibet, in, the, east, a, study, of, genome, wide, diversity, markers, found, tibet, to, be, an, additional, center, of, domestication, of, cultivated, barley, the, earliest, archaeological, evidence, of, the, consumption, of, wild, barley, hordeum, spontaneum, comes, from, the, epipaleolithic, at, ohalo, ii, at, the, southern, end, of, the, sea, of, galilee, where, grinding, stones, with, traces, of, starch, were, found, the, remains, were, dated, to, about, 23, 000, bc, the, earliest, evidence, for, the, domestication, of, barley, in, the, form, of, cultivars, that, cannot, reproduce, without, human, assistance, comes, from, mesopotamia, specifically, the, jarmo, region, of, modern, day, iraq, around, 9, 000, 7, 000, bc, domestication, changed, the, morphology, of, the, barley, grain, substantially, from, an, elongated, shape, to, a, more, rounded, spherical, one, wild, barley, has, distinctive, genes, alleles, and, regulators, with, potential, for, resistance, to, abiotic, or, biotic, stresses, these, may, help, cultivated, barley, to, adapt, to, climatic, changes, wild, barley, has, a, brittle, spike, upon, maturity, the, spikelets, separate, facilitating, seed, dispersal, domesticated, barley, has, nonshattering, spikelets, making, it, much, easier, to, harvest, the, mature, ears, the, nonshattering, condition, is, caused, by, a, mutation, in, one, of, two, tightly, linked, genes, known, as, bt, 1, and, bt, 2, many, cultivars, possess, both, mutations, the, nonshattering, condition, is, recessive, so, varieties, of, barley, that, exhibit, this, condition, are, homozygous, for, the, mutant, allele, domestication, in, barley, is, followed, by, the, change, of, key, phenotypic, traits, at, the, genetic, level, the, wild, barley, found, currently, in, the, fertile, crescent, may, not, be, the, progenitor, of, the, barley, cultivated, in, eritrea, and, ethiopia, indicating, that, it, may, have, been, domesticated, separately, in, eastern, africa, archaeobotanical, evidence, shows, that, barley, had, spread, throughout, eurasia, by, 2, 000, bc, genetic, analysis, demonstrates, that, cultivated, barley, followed, several, different, routes, over, time, by, 4200, bc, domesticated, barley, had, reached, eastern, finland, barley, has, been, grown, in, the, korean, peninsula, since, the, early, mumun, pottery, period, circa, 1500, 850, bc, barley, yava, in, sanskrit, is, mentioned, many, times, in, the, rigveda, and, other, indian, scriptures, as, a, principal, grain, in, ancient, india, traces, of, barley, cultivation, have, been, found, in, post, neolithic, bronze, age, harappan, civilization, 5, 700, 3, 300, years, ago, barley, beer, was, probably, one, of, the, first, alcoholic, drinks, developed, by, neolithic, humans, later, it, was, used, as, currency, the, sumerian, language, had, a, word, for, barley, akiti, in, ancient, mesopotamia, a, stalk, of, barley, was, the, primary, symbol, of, the, goddess, shala, rations, of, barley, for, workers, appear, in, linear, b, tablets, in, mycenaean, contexts, at, knossos, and, at, mycenaean, pylos, in, mainland, greece, the, ritual, significance, of, barley, possibly, dates, back, to, the, earliest, stages, of, the, eleusinian, mysteries, the, preparatory, kykeon, or, mixed, drink, of, the, initiates, prepared, from, barley, and, herbs, mentioned, in, the, homeric, hymn, to, demeter, the, goddess, s, name, may, have, meant, barley, mother, incorporating, the, ancient, cretan, word, d, ai, barley, the, practice, was, to, dry, the, barley, groats, and, roast, them, before, preparing, the, porridge, according, to, pliny, the, elder, s, natural, history, tibetan, barley, has, been, a, staple, food, in, tibetan, cuisine, since, the, fifth, century, ad, this, grain, along, with, a, cool, climate, that, permitted, storage, produced, a, civilization, that, was, able, to, raise, great, armies, it, is, made, into, a, flour, product, called, tsampa, that, is, still, a, staple, in, tibet, in, medieval, europe, bread, made, from, barley, and, rye, was, peasant, food, while, wheat, products, were, consumed, by, the, upper, classes, spikelets, are, arranged, in, triplets, which, alternate, along, the, rachis, in, wild, barley, and, other, old, world, species, of, hordeum, only, the, central, spikelet, is, fertile, while, the, other, two, are, reduced, this, condition, is, retained, in, certain, cultivars, known, as, two, row, barleys, a, pair, of, mutations, one, dominant, the, other, recessive, result, in, fertile, lateral, spikelets, to, produce, six, row, barleys, a, mutation, in, one, gene, vrs1, is, responsible, for, the, transition, from, two, row, to, six, row, barley, brewers, in, europe, tend, to, use, two, row, cultivars, and, breweries, in, north, america, use, six, row, barley, or, a, mix, and, there, are, important, differences, in, enzyme, content, kernel, shape, and, other, factors, that, malters, and, brewers, must, take, into, consideration, in, traditional, taxonomy, different, forms, of, barley, were, classified, as, different, species, based, on, morphological, differences, two, row, barley, with, shattering, spikes, wild, barley, was, named, hordeum, spontaneum, two, row, barley, with, nonshattering, spikes, was, named, as, h, distichon, six, row, barley, with, nonshattering, spikes, as, h, vulgare, or, h, hexastichum, and, six, row, with, shattering, spikes, as, h, agriocrithon, because, these, differences, were, driven, by, single, gene, mutations, coupled, with, cytological, and, molecular, evidence, most, recent, classifications, treat, these, forms, as, a, single, species, h, vulgare, hulless, or, naked, barley, hordeum, vulgare, var, nudum, is, a, form, of, domesticated, barley, with, an, easier, to, remove, hull, naked, barley, is, an, ancient, food, crop, but, a, new, industry, has, developed, around, uses, of, selected, hulless, barley, to, increase, the, digestibility, of, the, grain, especially, for, pigs, and, poultry, hulless, barley, has, been, investigated, for, several, potential, new, applications, as, whole, grain, bran, and, flour, in, 2022, world, production, of, barley, was, 155, million, tonnes, led, by, russia, accounting, for, 15, of, the, world, total, table, france, germany, and, canada, were, secondary, producers, worldwide, barley, production, was, fourth, among, grains, following, maize, 1, 2, billion, tonnes, wheat, 808, million, tonnes, and, rice, 776, million, tonnes, barley, is, a, crop, that, prefers, relatively, low, temperatures, 15, to, 20, c, 59, to, 68, f, in, the, growing, season, it, is, grown, around, the, world, in, temperate, areas, it, grows, best, in, well, drained, soil, in, full, sunshine, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, it, is, grown, for, food, and, straw, in, south, asia, north, and, east, africa, and, in, the, andes, of, south, america, in, dry, regions, it, requires, irrigation, it, has, a, short, growing, season, and, is, relatively, drought, tolerant, barley, is, more, tolerant, of, soil, salinity, than, other, cereals, varying, in, different, cultivars, it, has, less, winter, hardiness, than, winter, wheat, and, far, less, than, rye, like, other, cereals, barley, is, typically, planted, on, tilled, land, seed, was, traditionally, scattered, but, in, developed, countries, is, usually, drilled, as, it, grows, it, requires, soil, nutrients, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, often, supplied, as, fertilizers, it, needs, to, be, monitored, for, pests, and, diseases, and, if, necessary, treated, before, these, become, serious, the, stems, and, ears, turn, yellow, when, ripe, and, the, ears, begin, to, droop, traditional, harvesting, was, by, hand, with, sickles, or, scythes, in, developed, countries, harvesting, is, mechanised, with, combine, harvesters, among, the, insect, pests, of, barley, are, aphids, such, as, russian, wheat, aphid, caterpillars, such, as, of, the, armyworm, moth, barley, mealybug, and, wireworm, larvae, of, click, beetle, genera, such, as, aeolus, aphid, damage, can, often, be, tolerated, whereas, armyworms, can, eat, whole, leaves, wireworms, kill, seedlings, and, require, seed, or, preplanting, treatment, serious, fungal, diseases,
