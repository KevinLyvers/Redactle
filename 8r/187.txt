adrenaline, also, known, as, epinephrine, is, a, hormone, and, medication, which, is, involved, in, regulating, visceral, functions, e, g, respiration, it, appears, as, a, white, microcrystalline, granule, adrenaline, is, normally, produced, by, the, adrenal, glands, and, by, a, small, number, of, neurons, in, the, medulla, oblongata, it, plays, an, essential, role, in, the, fight, or, flight, response, by, increasing, blood, flow, to, muscles, heart, output, by, acting, on, the, sa, node, pupil, dilation, response, and, blood, sugar, level, it, does, this, by, binding, to, alpha, and, beta, receptors, it, is, found, in, many, animals, including, humans, and, some, single, celled, organisms, it, has, also, been, isolated, from, the, plant, scoparia, dulcis, found, in, northern, vietnam, as, a, medication, it, is, used, to, treat, several, conditions, including, allergic, reaction, anaphylaxis, cardiac, arrest, and, superficial, bleeding, inhaled, adrenaline, may, be, used, to, improve, the, symptoms, of, croup, it, may, also, be, used, for, asthma, when, other, treatments, are, not, effective, it, is, given, intravenously, by, injection, into, a, muscle, by, inhalation, or, by, injection, just, under, the, skin, common, side, effects, include, shakiness, anxiety, and, sweating, a, fast, heart, rate, and, high, blood, pressure, may, occur, occasionally, it, may, result, in, an, abnormal, heart, rhythm, while, the, safety, of, its, use, during, pregnancy, and, breastfeeding, is, unclear, the, benefits, to, the, mother, must, be, taken, into, account, a, case, has, been, made, for, the, use, of, adrenaline, infusion, in, place, of, the, widely, accepted, treatment, of, inotropes, for, preterm, infants, with, clinical, cardiovascular, compromise, although, sufficient, data, strongly, recommends, adrenaline, infusions, as, a, viable, treatment, more, trials, are, needed, to, conclusively, determine, that, these, infusions, will, successfully, reduce, morbidity, and, mortality, rates, among, preterm, cardiovascularly, compromised, infants, epinephrine, can, also, be, used, to, treat, open, angle, glaucoma, as, it, has, been, found, to, increase, the, outflow, of, aqueous, humor, in, the, eye, this, lowers, the, intraocular, pressure, in, the, eye, and, thus, aids, in, treatment, the, adrenal, medulla, is, a, major, contributor, to, total, circulating, catecholamines, l, dopa, is, at, a, higher, concentration, in, the, plasma, though, it, contributes, over, 90, of, circulating, adrenaline, little, adrenaline, is, found, in, other, tissues, mostly, in, scattered, chromaffin, cells, and, in, a, small, number, of, neurons, that, use, adrenaline, as, a, neurotransmitter, following, adrenalectomy, adrenaline, disappears, below, the, detection, limit, in, the, bloodstream, pharmacological, doses, of, adrenaline, stimulate, 1, 2, 1, 2, and, 3, adrenoceptors, of, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, sympathetic, nerve, receptors, are, classified, as, adrenergic, based, on, their, responsiveness, to, adrenaline, the, term, adrenergic, is, often, misinterpreted, in, that, the, main, sympathetic, neurotransmitter, is, noradrenaline, rather, than, adrenaline, as, discovered, by, ulf, von, euler, in, 1946, adrenaline, has, a, 2, adrenoceptor, mediated, effect, on, metabolism, and, the, airway, with, no, direct, neural, connection, from, the, sympathetic, ganglia, to, the, airway, walter, bradford, cannon, originally, proposed, the, concept, of, the, adrenal, medulla, and, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, being, involved, in, the, flight, fight, and, fright, response, but, the, adrenal, medulla, in, contrast, to, the, adrenal, cortex, is, not, required, for, survival, in, adrenalectomized, patients, hemodynamic, and, metabolic, responses, to, stimuli, such, as, hypoglycemia, and, exercise, remain, normal, one, physiological, stimulus, to, adrenaline, secretion, is, exercise, this, was, first, demonstrated, by, measuring, the, dilation, of, a, denervated, pupil, of, a, cat, on, a, treadmill, later, confirmed, using, a, biological, assay, of, urine, samples, biochemical, methods, for, measuring, catecholamines, in, plasma, were, published, from, 1950, onwards, although, much, valuable, work, has, been, published, using, fluorimetric, assays, to, measure, total, catecholamine, concentrations, the, method, is, too, non, specific, and, insensitive, to, accurately, determine, the, very, small, quantities, of, adrenaline, in, plasma, the, development, of, extraction, methods, and, enzyme, isotope, derivate, radio, enzymatic, assays, rea, transformed, the, analysis, down, to, a, sensitivity, of, 1, pg, for, adrenaline, early, rea, plasma, assays, indicated, that, adrenaline, and, total, catecholamines, rise, late, in, exercise, mostly, when, anaerobic, metabolism, commences, during, exercise, the, adrenaline, blood, concentration, rises, partially, from, the, increased, secretion, of, the, adrenal, medulla, and, partly, from, the, decreased, metabolism, of, adrenaline, due, to, reduced, blood, flow, to, the, liver, infusion, of, adrenaline, to, reproduce, exercise, circulating, concentrations, of, adrenaline, in, subjects, at, rest, has, little, hemodynamic, effect, other, than, a, slight, 2, mediated, fall, in, diastolic, blood, pressure, infusion, of, adrenaline, well, within, the, physiological, range, suppresses, human, airway, hyper, reactivity, sufficiently, to, antagonize, the, constrictor, effects, of, inhaled, histamine, a, link, between, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, and, the, lungs, was, shown, in, 1887, when, grossman, showed, that, stimulation, of, cardiac, accelerator, nerves, reversed, muscarine, induced, airway, constriction, in, experiments, in, the, dog, where, the, sympathetic, chain, was, cut, at, the, level, of, the, diaphragm, jackson, showed, that, there, was, no, direct, sympathetic, innervation, to, the, lung, but, bronchoconstriction, was, reversed, by, the, release, of, adrenaline, from, the, adrenal, medulla, an, increased, incidence, of, asthma, has, not, been, reported, for, adrenalectomized, patients, those, with, a, predisposition, to, asthma, will, have, some, protection, from, airway, hyper, reactivity, from, their, corticosteroid, replacement, therapy, exercise, induces, progressive, airway, dilation, in, normal, subjects, that, correlates, with, workload, and, is, not, prevented, by, beta, blockade, the, progressive, airway, dilation, with, increasing, exercise, is, mediated, by, a, progressive, reduction, in, resting, vagal, tone, beta, blockade, with, propranolol, causes, a, rebound, in, airway, resistance, after, exercise, in, normal, subjects, over, the, same, time, course, as, the, bronchoconstriction, seen, with, exercise, induced, asthma, the, reduction, in, airway, resistance, during, exercise, reduces, the, work, of, breathing, every, emotional, response, has, a, behavioral, an, autonomic, and, a, hormonal, component, the, hormonal, component, includes, the, release, of, adrenaline, an, adrenomedullary, response, to, stress, controlled, by, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, the, major, emotion, studied, in, relation, to, adrenaline, is, fear, in, an, experiment, subjects, who, were, injected, with, adrenaline, expressed, more, negative, and, fewer, positive, facial, expressions, to, fear, films, compared, to, a, control, group, these, subjects, also, reported, a, more, intense, fear, from, the, films, and, greater, mean, intensity, of, negative, memories, than, control, subjects, the, findings, from, this, study, demonstrate, that, there, are, learned, associations, between, negative, feelings, and, levels, of, adrenaline, overall, the, greater, amount, of, adrenaline, is, positively, correlated, with, an, aroused, state, of, negative, emotions, these, findings, can, be, an, effect, in, part, that, adrenaline, elicits, physiological, sympathetic, responses, including, an, increased, heart, rate, and, knee, shaking, which, can, be, attributed, to, the, feeling, of, fear, regardless, of, the, actual, level, of, fear, elicited, from, the, video, although, studies, have, found, a, definite, relation, between, adrenaline, and, fear, other, emotions, have, not, had, such, results, in, the, same, study, subjects, did, not, express, a, greater, amusement, to, an, amusement, film, nor, greater, anger, to, an, anger, film, similar, findings, were, also, supported, in, a, study, that, involved, rodent, subjects, that, either, were, able, or, unable, to, produce, adrenaline, findings, support, the, idea, that, adrenaline, has, a, role, in, facilitating, the, encoding, of, emotionally, arousing, events, contributing, to, higher, levels, of, arousal, due, to, fear, it, has, been, found, that, adrenergic, hormones, such, as, adrenaline, can, produce, retrograde, enhancement, of, long, term, memory, in, humans, the, release, of, adrenaline, due, to, emotionally, stressful, events, which, is, endogenous, adrenaline, can, modulate, memory, consolidation, of, the, events, ensuring, memory, strength, that, is, proportional, to, memory, importance, post, learning, adrenaline, activity, also, interacts, with, the, degree, of, arousal, associated, with, the, initial, coding, there, is, evidence, that, suggests, adrenaline, does, have, a, role, in, long, term, stress, adaptation, and, emotional, memory, encoding, specifically, adrenaline, may, also, play, a, role, in, elevating, arousal, and, fear, memory, under, particular, pathological, conditions, including, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, overall, extensive, evidence, indicates, that, epinephrine, epi, modulates, memory, consolidation, for, emotionally, arousing, tasks, in, animals, and, human, subjects, studies, have, also, found, that, recognition, memory, involving, adrenaline, depends, on, a, mechanism, that, depends, on, adrenoceptors, adrenaline, does, not, readily, cross, the, blood, brain, barrier, so, its, effects, on, memory, consolidation, are, at, least, partly, initiated, by, adrenoceptors, in, the, periphery, studies, have, found, that, sotalol, a, adrenoceptor, antagonist, that, also, does, not, readily, enter, the, brain, blocks, the, enhancing, effects, of, peripherally, administered, adrenaline, on, memory, these, findings, suggest, that, adrenoceptors, are, necessary, for, adrenaline, to, have, an, impact, on, memory, consolidation, increased, adrenaline, secretion, is, observed, in, pheochromocytoma, hypoglycemia, myocardial, infarction, and, to, a, lesser, degree, in, essential, tremor, also, known, as, benign, familial, or, idiopathic, tremor, a, general, increase, in, sympathetic, neural, activity, is, usually, accompanied, by, increased, adrenaline, secretion, but, there, is, selectivity, during, hypoxia, and, hypoglycemia, when, the, ratio, of, adrenaline, to, noradrenaline, is, considerably, increased, therefore, there, must, be, some, autonomy, of, the, adrenal, medulla, from, the, rest, of, the, sympathetic, system, myocardial, infarction, is, associated, with, high, levels, of, circulating, adrenaline, and, noradrenaline, particularly, in, cardiogenic, shock, benign, familial, tremor, essential, tremor, bft, is, responsive, to, peripheral, adrenergic, blockers, and, 2, stimulation, is, known, to, cause, tremor, patients, with, bft, were, found, to, have, increased, plasma, adrenaline, but, not, noradrenaline, low, or, absent, concentrations, of, adrenaline, can, be, seen, in, autonomic, neuropathy, or, following, adrenalectomy, failure, of, the, adrenal, cortex, as, with, addison, s, disease, can, suppress, adrenaline, secretion, as, the, activity, of, the, synthesizing, enzyme, phenylethanolamine, n, methyltransferase, depends, on, the, high, concentration, of, cortisol, that, drains, from, the, cortex, to, the, medulla, in, 1901, j, kichi, takamine, patented, a, purified, extract, from, the, adrenal, glands, which, was, trademarked, by, parke, davis, co, in, the, us, the, british, approved, name, and, european, pharmacopoeia, term, for, this, drug, is, hence, adrenaline, from, latin, ad, on, and, r, n, lis, of, the, kidney, from, ren, kidney, however, the, pharmacologist, john, abel, had, already, prepared, an, extract, from, adrenal, glands, as, early, as, 1897, and, he, coined, the, name, epinephrine, to, describe, it, from, ancient, greek, ep, upon, and, nephr, s, kidney, as, the, term, adrenaline, was, a, registered, trademark, in, the, us, and, in, the, belief, that, abel, s, extract, was, the, same, as, takamine, s, a, belief, since, disputed, epinephrine, instead, became, the, generic, name, used, in, the, us, and, remains, the, pharmaceutical, s, united, states, adopted, name, and, international, nonproprietary, name, though, the, name, adrenaline, is, frequently, used, the, terminology, is, now, one, of, the, few, differences, between, the, inn, and, ban, systems, of, names, although, european, health, professionals, and, scientists, preferentially, use, the, term, adrenaline, the, converse, is, true, among, american, health, professionals, and, scientists, nevertheless, even, among, the, latter, receptors, for, this, substance, are, called, adrenergic, receptors, or, adrenoceptors, and, pharmaceuticals, that, mimic, its, effects, are, often, called, adrenergics, the, history, of, adrenaline, and, epinephrine, is, reviewed, by, rao, as, a, hormone, adrenaline, acts, on, nearly, all, body, tissues, by, binding, to, adrenergic, receptors, its, effects, on, various, tissues, depend, on, the, type, of, tissue, and, expression, of, specific, forms, of, adrenergic, receptors, for, example, high, levels, of, adrenaline, cause, smooth, muscle, relaxation, in, the, airways, but, causes, contraction, of, the, smooth, muscle, that, lines, most, arterioles, adrenaline, is, a, nonselective, agonist, of, all, adrenergic, receptors, including, the, major, subtypes, 1, 2, 1, 2, and, 3, adrenaline, s, binding, to, these, receptors, triggers, a, number, of, metabolic, changes, binding, to, adrenergic, receptors, inhibits, insulin, secretion, by, the, pancreas, stimulates, glycogenolysis, in, the, liver, and, muscle, and, stimulates, glycolysis, and, inhibits, insulin, mediated, glycogenesis, in, muscle, adrenergic, receptor, binding, triggers, glucagon, secretion, in, the, pancreas, increased, adrenocorticotropic, hormone, acth, secretion, by, the, pituitary, gland, and, increased, lipolysis, by, adipose, tissue, together, these, effects, increase, blood, glucose, and, fatty, acids, providing, substrates, for, energy, production, within, cells, throughout, the, body, binding, of, adrenergic, receptor, also, increases, the, production, of, cyclic, amp, adrenaline, causes, liver, cells, to, release, glucose, into, the, blood, acting, through, both, alpha, and, beta, adrenergic, receptors, to, stimulate, glycogenolysis, adrenaline, binds, to, 2, receptors, on, liver, cells, which, changes, conformation, and, helps, g, s, a, heterotrimeric, g, protein, exchange, gdp, to, gtp, this, trimeric, g, protein, dissociates, to, g, s, alpha, and, g, s, beta, gamma, subunits, g, s, alpha, stimulates, adenylyl, cyclase, thus, converting, adenosine, triphosphate, into, cyclic, adenosine, monophosphate, amp, cyclic, amp, activates, protein, kinase, a, protein, kinase, a, phosphorylates, and, partially, activates, phosphorylase, kinase, adrenaline, also, binds, to, 1, adrenergic, receptors, causing, an, increase, in, inositol, trisphosphate, inducing, calcium, ions, to, enter, the, cytoplasm, calcium, ions, bind, to, calmodulin, which, leads, to, further, activation, of, phosphorylase, kinase, phosphorylase, kinase, phosphorylates, glycogen, phosphorylase, which, then, breaks, down, glycogen, leading, to, the, production, of, glucose, adrenaline, also, has, significant, effects, on, the, cardiovascular, system, it, increases, peripheral, resistance, via, 1, receptor, dependent, vasoconstriction, and, increases, cardiac, output, by, binding, to, 1, receptors, the, goal, of, reducing, peripheral, circulation, is, to, increase, coronary, and, cerebral, perfusion, pressures, and, therefore, increase, oxygen, exchange, at, the, cellular, level, while, adrenaline, does, increase, aortic, cerebral, and, carotid, circulation, pressure, it, lowers, carotid, blood, flow, and, end, tidal, co, 2, or, e, t, co, 2, levels, it, appears, that, adrenaline, improves, microcirculation, at, the, expense, of, the, capillary, beds, where, perfusion, takes, place, adrenaline, may, be, quantified, in, blood, plasma, or, serum, as, a, diagnostic, aid, to, monitor, therapeutic, administration, or, to, identify, the, causative, agent, in, a, potential, poisoning, victim, endogenous, plasma, adrenaline, concentrations, in, resting, adults, usually, are, less, than, 10, ng, l, but, they, may, increase, by, 10, fold, during, exercise, and, by, 50, fold, or, more, during, times, of, stress, pheochromocytoma, patients, often, have, plasma, adrenaline, levels, of, 1000, 10, 000, ng, l, parenteral, administration, of, adrenaline, to, acute, care, cardiac, patients, can, produce, plasma, concentrations, of, 10, 000, to, 100, 000, ng, l, in, chemical, terms, adrenaline, is, one, of, a, group, of, monoamines, called, the, catecholamines, adrenaline, is, synthesized, in, the, chromaffin, cells, of, the, adrenal, gland, s, adrenal, medulla, and, a, small, number, of, neurons, in, the, medulla, oblongata, in, the, brain, through, a, metabolic, pathway, that, converts, the, amino, acids, phenylalanine, and, tyrosine, into, a, series, of, metabolic, intermediates, and, ultimately, adrenaline, tyrosine, is, first, oxidized, to, l, dopa, by, tyrosine, hydroxylase, this, is, the, rate, limiting, step, then, it, is, subsequently, decarboxylated, to, give, dopamine, by, dopa, decarboxylase, aromatic, l, amino, acid, decarboxylase, dopamine, is, then, converted, to, noradrenaline, by, dopamine, beta, hydroxylase, which, utilizes, ascorbic, acid, vitamin, c, and, copper, the, final, step, in, adrenaline, biosynthesis, is, the, methylation, of, the, primary, amine, of, noradrenaline, this, reaction, is, catalyzed, by, the, enzyme, phenylethanolamine, n, methyltransferase, pnmt, which, utilizes, s, adenosyl, methionine, same, as, the, methyl, donor, while, pnmt, is, found, primarily, in, the, cytosol, of, the, endocrine, cells, of, the, adrenal, medulla, also, known, as, chromaffin, cells, it, has, been, detected, at, low, levels, in, both, the, heart, and, brain, the, major, physiologic, triggers, of, adrenaline, release, center, upon, stresses, such, as, physical, threat, excitement, noise, bright, lights, and, high, or, low, ambient, temperature, all, of, these, stimuli, are, processed, in, the, central, nervous, system, adrenocorticotropic, hormone, acth, and, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, stimulate, the, synthesis, of, adrenaline, precursors, by, enhancing, the, activity, of, tyrosine, hydroxylase, and, dopamine, hydroxylase, two, key, enzymes, involved, in, catecholamine, synthesis, acth, also, stimulates, the, adrenal, cortex, to, release, cortisol, which, increases, the, expression, of, pnmt, in, chromaffin, cells, enhancing, adrenaline, synthesis, this, is, most, often, done, in, response, to, stress, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, acting, via, splanchnic, nerves, to, the, adrenal, medulla, stimulates, the, release, of, adrenaline, acetylcholine, released, by, preganglionic, sympathetic, fibers, of, these, nerves, acts, on, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptors, causing, cell, depolarization, and, an, influx, of, calcium, through, voltage, gated, calcium, channels, calcium, triggers, the, exocytosis, of, chromaffin, granules, and, thus, the, release, of, adrenaline, and, noradrenaline, into, the, bloodstream, for, noradrenaline, to, be, acted, upon, by, pnmt, in, the, cytosol, it, must, first, be, shipped, out, of, granules, of, the, chromaffin, cells, this, may, occur, via, the, catecholamine, h, exchanger, vmat1, vmat1, is, also, responsible, for, transporting, newly, synthesized, adrenaline, from, the, cytosol, back, into, chromaffin, granules, in, preparation, for, release, unlike, many, other, hormones, adrenaline, as, with, other, catecholamines, does, not, exert, negative, feedback, to, down, regulate, its, own, synthesis, abnormal, adrenaline, levels, can, occur, in, various, conditions, such, as, surreptitious, adrenaline, administration, pheochromocytoma, and, other, tumors, of, the, sympathetic, ganglia, its, action, is, terminated, with, reuptake, into, nerve, terminal, endings, some, minute, dilution, and, metabolism, by, monoamine, oxidase, and, catechol, o, methyl, transferase, into, 3, 4, dihydroxymandelic, acid, and, metanephrine, extracts, of, the, adrenal, gland, were, first, obtained, by, polish, physiologist, napoleon, cybulski, in, 1895, these, extracts, which, he, called, nadnerczyna, adrenalin, contained, adrenaline, and, other, catecholamines, american, ophthalmologist, william, h, bates, discovered, adrenaline, s, usage, for, eye, surgeries, prior, to, 20, april, 1896, in, 1897, john, jacob, abel, 1857, 1938, the, father, of, modern, pharmacology, found, a, natural, substance, produced, by, the, adrenal, glands, that, he, named, epinephrine, the, first, hormone, to, be, identified, it, remains, a, crucial, first, line, treatment, for, cardiac, arrests, severe, allergic, reactions, and, other, conditions, in, 1901, jokichi, takamine, successfully, isolated, and, purified, the, hormone, from, the, adrenal, glands, of, sheep, and, oxen, adrenaline, was, first, synthesized, in, the, laboratory, by, friedrich, stolz, and, henry, drysdale, dakin, independently, in, 1904, although, secretin, is, mentioned, as, the, first, hormone, adrenaline, is, the, first, hormone, since, the, discovery, of, the, activity, of, adrenal, extract, on, blood, pressure, was, observed, in, 1895, before, that, of, secretin, in, 1902, in, 1895, george, oliver, 1841, 1915, a, general, practitioner, in, north, yorkshire, and, edward, albert, sch, fer, 1850, 1935, a, physiologist, at, university, college, of, london, published, a, paper, about, the, active, component, of, adrenal, gland, extract, causing, the, increase, in, blood, pressure, and, heart, rate, was, from, the, medulla, but, not, the, cortex, of, the, adrenal, gland, in, 1897, john, jacob, abel, 1857, 1938, of, johns, hopkins, university, the, first, chairman, of, the, first, us, department, of, pharmacology, found, a, compound, called, epinephrine, with, the, molecular, formula, of, c, 17, h, 15, no, 4, abel, claimed, his, principle, from, adrenal, gland, extract, was, active, in, 1900, j, kichi, takamine, 1854, 1922, a, japanese, chemist, worked, with, his, assistant, keizo, uenaka, 1876, 1960, to, purify, a, 2000, times, more, active, principle, than, epinephrine, from, the, adrenal, gland, named, adrenaline, with, the, molecular, formula, c, 10, h, 15, no, 3, additionally, in, 1900, thomas, aldrich, of, parke, davis, scientific, laboratory, also, purified, adrenaline, independently, takamine, and, parke, davis, later, in, 1901, both, got, the, patent, for, adrenaline, the, fight, for, terminology, between, adrenaline, and, epinephrine, was, not, ended, until, the, first, adrenaline, structural, discovery, by, hermann, pauly, 1870, 1950, in, 1903, and, the, first, adrenaline, synthesis, by, friedrich, stolz, 1860, 1936, a, german, chemist, in, 1904, they, both, believed, that, takamine, s, compound, was, the, active, principle, while, abel, s, compound, was, the, inactive, one, stolz, synthesized, adrenaline, from, its, ketone, form, adrenalone, an, adrenaline, junkie, is, someone, who, engages, in, sensation, seeking, behavior, through, the, pursuit, of, novel, and, intense, experiences, without, regard, for, physical, social, legal, or, financial, risk, such, activities, include, extreme, and, risky, sports, substance, abuse, unsafe, sex, and, crime, the, term, relates, to, the, increase, in, circulating, levels, of, adrenaline, during, physiological, stress, such, an, increase, in, the, circulating, concentration, of, adrenaline, is, secondary, to, the, activation, of, the, sympathetic, nerves, innervating, the, adrenal, medulla, as, it, is, rapid, and, not, present, in, animals, where, the, adrenal, gland, has, been, removed, although, such, stress, triggers, adrenaline, release, it, also, activates, many, other, responses, within, the, central, nervous, system, reward, system, which, drives, behavioral, responses, while, the, circulating, adrenaline, concentration, is, present, it, may, not, drive, behavior, nevertheless, adrenaline, infusion, alone, does, increase, alertness, and, has, roles, in, the, brain, including, the, augmentation, of, memory, consolidation, adrenaline, has, been, implicated, in, feats, of, great, strength, often, occurring, in, times, of, crisis, for, example, there, are, stories, of, a, parent, lifting, part, of, a, car, when, their, child, is, trapped, underneath, showcasing, the, insane, amount, of, potential, the, body, can, endure, under, stress, and, highlighting, the, profound, effects, of, adrenaline, in, unlocking, extraordinary, physical, abilities, stimulants, phenylethanolamine
