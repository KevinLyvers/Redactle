crabs, are, decapod, crustaceans, of, the, infraorder, brachyura, which, typically, have, a, very, short, projecting, tail, like, abdomen, usually, hidden, entirely, under, the, thorax, brachyura, means, short, tail, in, greek, they, live, in, all, the, world, s, oceans, in, freshwater, and, on, land, are, generally, covered, with, a, thick, exoskeleton, and, have, a, single, pair, of, pincers, on, each, arm, they, first, appeared, during, the, jurassic, period, around, 200, million, years, ago, crabs, are, generally, covered, with, a, thick, exoskeleton, composed, primarily, of, highly, mineralized, chitin, behind, their, pair, of, chelae, claws, are, six, walking, legs, and, then, two, swimming, legs, the, crab, breathes, through, gills, on, its, underside, gills, must, be, at, least, moist, to, work, crabs, vary, in, size, from, the, pea, crab, a, few, millimeters, wide, to, the, japanese, spider, crab, with, a, leg, span, up, to, 4, m, 13, ft, several, other, groups, of, crustaceans, with, similar, appearances, such, as, king, crabs, and, porcelain, crabs, are, not, true, crabs, but, have, evolved, features, similar, to, true, crabs, through, a, process, known, as, carcinisation, crabs, are, found, in, all, of, the, world, s, oceans, as, well, as, in, fresh, water, and, on, land, particularly, in, tropical, regions, about, 850, species, are, freshwater, crabs, crabs, often, show, marked, sexual, dimorphism, males, often, have, larger, claws, a, tendency, that, is, particularly, pronounced, in, the, fiddler, crabs, of, the, genus, uca, ocypodidae, in, fiddler, crabs, males, have, one, greatly, enlarged, claw, used, for, communication, particularly, for, attracting, a, mate, another, conspicuous, difference, is, the, form, of, the, pleon, abdomen, in, most, male, crabs, this, is, narrow, and, triangular, in, form, while, females, have, a, broader, rounded, abdomen, this, is, because, female, crabs, brood, fertilised, eggs, on, their, pleopods, crabs, attract, a, mate, through, chemical, pheromones, visual, acoustic, or, vibratory, means, pheromones, are, used, by, most, fully, aquatic, crabs, while, terrestrial, and, semiterrestrial, crabs, often, use, visual, signals, such, as, fiddler, crab, males, waving, their, large, claws, to, attract, females, the, vast, number, of, brachyuran, crabs, have, internal, fertilisation, and, mate, belly, to, belly, for, many, aquatic, species, mating, takes, place, just, after, the, female, has, moulted, and, is, still, soft, females, can, store, the, sperm, for, a, long, time, before, using, it, to, fertilise, their, eggs, when, fertilisation, has, taken, place, the, eggs, are, released, onto, the, female, s, abdomen, below, the, tail, flap, secured, with, a, sticky, material, in, this, location, they, are, protected, during, embryonic, development, females, carrying, eggs, are, called, berried, since, the, eggs, resemble, round, berries, when, development, is, complete, the, female, releases, the, newly, hatched, larvae, into, the, water, where, they, are, part, of, the, plankton, the, release, is, often, timed, with, the, tidal, and, light, dark, diurnal, cycle, the, free, swimming, tiny, zoea, larvae, can, float, and, take, advantage, of, water, currents, they, have, a, spine, which, probably, reduces, the, rate, of, predation, by, larger, animals, the, zoea, of, most, species, must, find, food, but, some, crabs, provide, enough, yolk, in, the, eggs, that, the, larval, stages, can, continue, to, live, off, the, yolk, each, species, has, a, particular, number, of, zoeal, stages, separated, by, moults, before, they, change, into, a, megalopa, stage, which, resembles, an, adult, crab, except, for, having, the, abdomen, tail, sticking, out, behind, after, one, more, moult, the, crab, is, a, juvenile, living, on, the, bottom, rather, than, floating, in, the, water, this, last, moult, from, megalopa, to, juvenile, is, critical, and, it, must, take, place, in, a, habitat, that, is, suitable, for, the, juvenile, to, survive, 63, 77, most, species, of, terrestrial, crabs, must, migrate, down, to, the, ocean, to, release, their, larvae, in, some, cases, this, entails, very, extensive, migrations, after, living, for, a, short, time, as, larvae, in, the, ocean, the, juveniles, must, do, this, migration, in, reverse, in, many, tropical, areas, with, land, crabs, these, migrations, often, result, in, considerable, roadkill, of, migrating, crabs, 113, 114, once, crabs, have, become, juveniles, they, still, have, to, keep, moulting, many, more, times, to, become, adults, they, are, covered, with, a, hard, shell, which, would, otherwise, prevent, growth, the, moult, cycle, is, coordinated, by, hormones, when, preparing, for, moult, the, old, shell, is, softened, and, partly, eroded, away, while, the, rudimentary, beginnings, of, a, new, shell, form, under, it, at, the, time, of, moulting, the, crab, takes, in, a, lot, of, water, to, expand, and, crack, open, the, old, shell, at, a, line, of, weakness, along, the, back, edge, of, the, carapace, the, crab, must, then, extract, all, of, itself, including, its, legs, mouthparts, eyestalks, and, even, the, lining, of, the, front, and, back, of, the, digestive, tract, from, the, old, shell, this, is, a, difficult, process, that, takes, many, hours, and, if, a, crab, gets, stuck, it, will, die, after, freeing, itself, from, the, old, shell, now, called, an, exuvia, the, crab, is, extremely, soft, and, hides, until, its, new, shell, has, hardened, while, the, new, shell, is, still, soft, the, crab, can, expand, it, to, make, room, for, future, growth, 78, 79, crabs, typically, walk, sideways, hence, the, term, crabwise, because, of, the, articulation, of, the, legs, which, makes, a, sidelong, gait, more, efficient, some, crabs, walk, forward, or, backward, including, raninids, libinia, emarginata, and, mictyris, platycheles, some, crabs, like, the, portunidae, and, matutidae, are, also, capable, of, swimming, the, portunidae, especially, so, as, their, last, pair, of, walking, legs, are, flattened, into, swimming, paddles, 96, crabs, are, mostly, active, animals, with, complex, behaviour, patterns, such, as, communicating, by, drumming, or, waving, their, pincers, crabs, tend, to, be, aggressive, toward, one, another, and, males, often, fight, to, gain, access, to, females, on, rocky, seashores, where, nearly, all, caves, and, crevices, are, occupied, crabs, may, also, fight, over, hiding, holes, fiddler, crabs, genus, uca, dig, burrows, in, sand, or, mud, which, they, use, for, resting, hiding, and, mating, and, to, defend, against, intruders, 28, 29, 99, crabs, are, omnivores, feeding, primarily, on, algae, and, taking, any, other, food, including, molluscs, worms, other, crustaceans, fungi, bacteria, and, detritus, depending, on, their, availability, and, the, crab, species, for, many, crabs, a, mixed, diet, of, plant, and, animal, matter, results, in, the, fastest, growth, and, greatest, fitness, some, species, are, more, specialised, in, their, diets, based, in, plankton, clams, or, fish, 85, crabs, are, known, to, work, together, to, provide, food, and, protection, for, their, family, and, during, mating, season, to, find, a, comfortable, spot, for, the, female, to, release, her, eggs, crabs, make, up, 20, of, all, marine, crustaceans, caught, farmed, and, consumed, worldwide, amounting, to, 1, 5, million, tonnes, annually, one, species, portunus, trituberculatus, accounts, for, one, fifth, of, that, total, other, commercially, important, taxa, include, portunus, pelagicus, several, species, in, the, genus, chionoecetes, the, blue, crab, callinectes, sapidus, charybdis, spp, cancer, pagurus, the, dungeness, crab, metacarcinus, magister, and, scylla, serrata, each, of, which, yields, more, than, 20, 000, tonnes, annually, in, some, crab, species, meat, is, harvested, by, manually, twisting, and, pulling, off, one, or, both, claws, and, returning, the, live, crab, to, the, water, in, the, knowledge, that, the, crab, may, survive, and, regenerate, the, claws, crabs, are, prepared, and, eaten, as, a, dish, in, many, different, ways, all, over, the, world, some, species, are, eaten, whole, including, the, shell, such, as, soft, shell, crab, with, other, species, just, the, claws, or, legs, are, eaten, the, latter, is, particularly, common, for, larger, crabs, such, as, the, snow, crab, in, many, cultures, the, roe, of, the, female, crab, is, also, eaten, which, usually, appears, orange, or, yellow, in, fertile, crabs, this, is, popular, in, southeast, asian, cultures, some, mediterranean, and, northern, european, cultures, and, on, the, east, chesapeake, and, gulf, coasts, of, the, united, states, in, some, regions, spices, improve, the, culinary, experience, in, southeast, asia, and, the, indosphere, masala, crab, and, chilli, crab, are, examples, of, heavily, spiced, dishes, in, the, chesapeake, bay, region, blue, crab, is, often, steamed, with, old, bay, seasoning, alaskan, king, crab, or, snow, crab, legs, are, usually, simply, boiled, and, served, with, garlic, or, lemon, butter, for, the, british, dish, dressed, crab, the, crab, meat, is, extracted, and, placed, inside, the, hard, shell, one, american, way, to, prepare, crab, meat, is, by, extracting, it, and, adding, varying, amounts, of, binders, such, as, egg, white, cracker, meal, mayonnaise, or, mustard, creating, a, crab, cake, crabs, can, also, be, made, into, a, bisque, a, global, dish, of, french, origin, which, in, its, authentic, form, includes, in, the, broth, the, pulverized, shells, of, the, shellfish, from, which, it, is, made, imitation, crab, also, called, surimi, is, made, from, minced, fish, meat, that, is, crafted, and, colored, to, resemble, crab, meat, while, it, is, sometimes, disdained, among, some, elements, of, the, culinary, industry, as, an, unacceptably, low, quality, substitute, for, real, crab, this, does, not, hinder, its, popularity, especially, as, a, sushi, ingredient, in, japan, and, south, korea, and, in, home, cooking, where, cost, is, often, a, chief, concern, indeed, surimi, is, an, important, source, of, protein, in, most, east, and, southeast, asian, cultures, appearing, in, staple, ingredients, such, as, fish, balls, and, fish, cake, whether, crustaceans, as, a, whole, experience, pain, or, not, is, a, scientific, debate, that, has, ethical, implications, for, crab, dish, preparation, crabs, are, very, often, boiled, alive, as, part, of, the, cooking, process, advocates, for, animals, a, scottish, animal, welfare, group, stated, in, 2005, that, scientific, evidence, strongly, suggests, that, there, is, a, potential, for, decapod, crustaceans, and, cephalopods, to, experience, pain, and, suffering, this, is, primarily, due, to, the, likelihood, that, decapod, crustaceans, can, feel, pain, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, they, have, been, shown, to, have, opioid, receptors, and, to, respond, to, opioids, analgesics, such, as, morphine, in, a, similar, way, to, vertebrates, similarities, between, decapod, and, vertebrate, stress, systems, and, behavioral, responses, to, noxious, stimuli, were, given, as, additional, evidence, for, the, capacity, of, decapods, to, experience, pain, in, 2005, a, review, of, the, literature, by, the, norwegian, scientific, committee, for, food, safety, tentatively, concluded, that, it, is, unlikely, that, can, feel, pain, though, they, note, that, there, is, apparently, a, paucity, of, exact, knowledge, on, sentience, in, crustaceans, and, more, research, is, needed, this, conclusion, is, based, on, the, lobster, s, simple, nervous, system, the, report, assumes, that, the, violent, reaction, of, lobsters, to, boiling, water, is, a, reflex, response, i, e, does, not, involve, conscious, perception, to, noxious, stimuli, the, earliest, unambiguous, crab, fossils, date, from, the, early, jurassic, with, the, oldest, being, eocarcinus, from, the, early, pliensbachian, of, britain, which, likely, represents, a, stem, group, lineage, as, it, lacks, several, key, morphological, features, that, define, modern, crabs, most, jurassic, crabs, are, only, known, from, dorsal, top, half, of, the, body, carapaces, making, it, difficult, to, determine, their, relationships, crabs, radiated, in, the, late, jurassic, corresponding, with, an, increase, in, reef, habitats, though, they, would, decline, at, the, end, of, the, jurassic, as, the, result, of, the, decline, of, reef, ecosystems, crabs, increased, in, diversity, through, the, cretaceous, and, represented, the, dominant, group, of, decapods, by, the, end, of, the, period, the, crab, infraorder, brachyura, belongs, to, the, group, reptantia, which, consists, of, the, walking, crawling, decapods, lobsters, and, crabs, brachyura, is, the, sister, clade, to, the, infraorder, anomura,

species, in, 98, families, as, many, as, the, remainder, of, the, decapoda, the, evolution, of, crabs, is, characterized, by, an, increasingly, robust, body, and, a, reduction, in, the, abdomen, although, many, other, groups, have, undergone, similar, processes, carcinisation, is, most, advanced, in, crabs, the, telson, is, no, longer, functional, in, crabs, and, the, uropods, are, absent, having, probably, evolved, into, small, devices, for, holding, the, reduced, abdomen, tight, against, the, sternum, in, most, decapods, the, gonopores, sexual, openings, are, found, on, the, legs, since, crabs, use, their, first, two, pairs, of, pleopods, abdominal, appendages, for, sperm, transfer, this, arrangement, has, changed, as, the, male, abdomen, evolved, into, a, slimmer, shape, the, gonopores, have, moved, toward, the, midline, away, from, the, legs, and, onto, the, sternum, a, similar, change, occurred, independently, with, the, female, gonopores, the, movement, of, the, female, gonopore, to, the, sternum, defines, the, clade, eubrachyura, and, the, later, change, in, the, position, of, the, male, gonopore, defines, the, thoracotremata, it, is, still, a, subject, of, debate, whether, a, monophyletic, group, is, formed, by, those, crabs, where, the, female, but, not, male, gonopores, are, situated, on, the, sternum, numbers, of, extant, and, extinct, species, are, given, in, brackets, the, superfamily, eocarcinoidea, containing, eocarcinus, and, platykotta, was, formerly, thought, to, contain, the, oldest, crabs, it, is, now, considered, part, of, the, anomura, recent, studies, have, found, the, following, superfamilies, and, families, to, not, be, monophyletic, but, rather, paraphyletic, or, polyphyletic, both, the, constellation, cancer, and, the, astrological, sign, cancer, are, named, after, the, crab, and, depicted, as, a, crab, william, parsons, 3rd, earl, of, rosse, drew, the, crab, nebula, in, 1848, and, noticed, its, similarity, to, the,

the, sea, tells, the, story, of, a, gigantic, crab, who, made, the, waters, of, the, sea, go, up, and, down, like, the, tides, the, auction, for, the, crab, quota, in, 2019, russia, is, the, largest, revenue, auction, in, the, world, except, the, spectrum, auctions, in, malay, mythology, as, related, by, hugh, clifford, to, walter, william, skeat, ocean, tides, are, believed, to, be, caused, by, water, rushing, in, and, out, of, a, hole, in, the, navel, of, the, seas, pusat, tasek, where, there, sits, a, gigantic, crab, which, twice, a, day, gets, out, in, order, to, search, for, food, 7, 8, the, kapsiki, people, of, north, cameroon, use, the, way, crabs, handle, objects, for, divination, the, term, crab, mentality, is, derived, from, a, type, of, detrimental, social, behavior, observed, in, crabs
