agaricus, is, a, genus, of, mushroom, forming, fungi, containing, both, edible, and, poisonous, species, with, over, 400, members, worldwide, and, possibly, again, as, many, disputed, or, newly, discovered, species, the, genus, includes, the, common, button, mushroom, agaricus, bisporus, and, the, field, mushroom, a, campestris, the, dominant, cultivated, mushrooms, of, the, west, members, of, agaricus, are, characterized, by, having, a, fleshy, cap, or, pileus, from, the, underside, of, which, grow, a, number, of, radiating, plates, or, gills, on, which, are, produced, the, naked, spores, they, are, distinguished, from, other, members, of, their, family, agaricaceae, by, their, chocolate, brown, spores, members, of, agaricus, also, have, a, stem, or, stipe, which, elevates, it, above, the, object, on, which, the, mushroom, grows, or, substrate, and, a, partial, veil, which, protects, the, developing, gills, and, later, forms, a, ring, or, annulus, on, the, stalk, several, origins, of, genus, name, agaricus, have, been, proposed, it, possibly, originates, from, ancient, sarmatia, europaea, where, people, agari, promontory, agarum, and, a, river, agarus, were, known, all, located, on, the, northern, shore, of, sea, of, azov, probably, near, modern, berdiansk, in, ukraine, note, also, greek, agarik, n, a, sort, of, tree, fungus, there, has, been, an, agaricon, adans, genus, treated, by, donk, in, persoonia, 1, 180, for, many, years, members, of, the, genus, agaricus, were, given, the, generic, name, psalliota, and, this, can, still, be, seen, in, older, books, on, mushrooms, all, proposals, to, conserve, agaricus, against, psalliota, or, vice, versa, have, so, far, been, considered, superfluous, dok, reports, linnaeus, name, is, devalidated, so, the, proper, author, citation, apparently, is, l, per, fr, 1821, because, agaricus, was, not, linked, to, tournefort, s, name, linnaeus, places, both, agaricus, dill, and, amanita, dill, in, synonymy, but, truly, a, replacement, for, amanita, dill, which, would, require, a, quercinus, not, a, campestris, be, the, type, this, question, is, compounded, because, fries, himself, used, agaricus, roughly, in, linnaeus, sense, which, leads, to, issues, with, amanita, and, a, campestris, was, eventually, excluded, from, agaricus, by, karsten, and, was, apparently, in, lepiota, at, the, time, donk, wrote, this, commenting, that, a, type, conservation, might, become, necessary, the, alternate, name, for, the, genus, psalliota, derived, from, the, greek, psalion, ring, was, first, published, by, fries, 1821, as, trib, psalliota, the, type, is, agaricus, campestris, widely, accepted, except, by, earle, who, proposed, a, cretaceus, paul, kummer, not, qu, let, who, merely, excluded, stropharia, was, the, first, to, elevate, the, tribe, to, a, genus, psalliota, was, the, tribe, containing, the, type, of, agaricus, so, when, separated, it, should, have, caused, the, rest, of, the, genus, to, be, renamed, but, this, is, not, what, happened, the, use, of, phylogenetic, analysis, to, determine, evolutionary, relationships, amongst, agaricus, species, has, increased, the, understanding, of, this, taxonomically, difficult, genus, although, much, work, remains, to, be, done, to, fully, delineate, infrageneric, relationships, prior, to, these, analyses, the, genus, agaricus, as, circumscribed, by, rolf, singer, was, divided, into, 42, species, grouped, into, five, sections, based, on, reactions, of, mushroom, tissue, to, air, or, various, chemical, reagents, as, well, as, subtle, differences, in, mushroom, morphology, restriction, fragment, length, polymorphism, analysis, demonstrated, this, classification, scheme, needed, revision, as, of, 2018, this, genus, is, divided, into, 6, subgenera, and, more, than, 20, sections, subgenus, agaricus, subgenus, flavoagaricus, subgenus, minores, subgenus, minoriopsis, subgenus, pseudochitonia, subgenus, spissicaules, the, fungal, genus, agaricus, as, late, as, 2008, was, believed, to, contain, about, 200, species, worldwide, but, since, then, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, have, revalidated, several, disputed, species, as, well, as, resolved, some, species, complexes, and, aided, in, discovery, and, description, of, a, wide, range, of, mostly, tropical, species, that, were, formerly, unknown, to, science, as, of, 2020, the, genus, is, believed, to, contain, no, fewer, than, 400, species, and, possibly, many, more, the, medicinal, mushroom, known, in, japan, as, echigoshirayukidake, was, initially, also, thought, to, be, an, agaricus, either, a, subspecies, of, agaricus, blazei, i, e, a, subrufescens, or, a, new, species, it, was, eventually, identified, as, sclerotium, of, the, crust, forming, bark, fungus, ceraceomyces, tessulatus, which, is, not, particularly, closely, related, to, agaricus, several, secotioid, puffball, like, fungi, have, in, recent, times, be, recognized, as, highly, aberrant, members, of, agaricus, and, are, now, included, here, these, typically, inhabit, deserts, where, few, fungi, and, even, fewer, of, the, familiar, cap, and, stalk, mushroom, shape, grow, another, desert, species, a, zelleri, was, erroneously, placed, in, the, present, genus, and, is, now, known, as, gyrophragmium, californicum, in, addition, the, scientific, names, agaricus, and, even, more, so, psalliota, were, historically, often, used, as, a, wastebasket, taxon, for, any, and, all, similar, mushrooms, regardless, of, their, actual, relationships, species, either, confirmed, or, suspected, to, belong, into, this, genus, include, a, notable, group, of, poisonous, agaricus, is, the, clade, around, the, yellow, staining, mushroom, a, xanthodermus, one, species, reported, from, africa, a, aurantioviolaceus, is, reportedly, deadly, poisonous, far, more, dangerous, is, the, fact, that, agaricus, when, still, young, and, most, valuable, for, eating, are, easily, confused, with, several, deadly, species, of, amanita, in, particular, the, species, collectively, called, destroying, angels, as, well, as, the, white, form, of, the, appropriately, named, death, cap, amanita, phalloides, as, well, as, some, other, highly, poisonous, fungi, an, easy, way, to, recognize, amanita, is, the, gills, which, remain, whitish, at, all, times, in, that, genus, in, agaricus, by, contrast, the, gills, are, only, initially, white, turning, dull, pink, as, they, mature, and, eventually, the, typical, chocolate, brown, as, the, spores, are, released, even, so, agaricus, should, generally, be, avoided, by, inexperienced, collectors, since, other, harmful, species, are, not, as, easily, recognized, and, clearly, recognizable, mature, agaricus, are, often, too, soft, and, maggot, infested, for, eating, when, collecting, agaricus, for, food, it, is, important, to, identify, every, individual, specimen, with, certainty, since, one, amanita, fungus, of, the, most, poisonous, species, is, sufficient, to, kill, an, adult, human, even, the, shed, spores, of, a, discarded, specimen, are, suspected, to, cause, life, threatening, poisoning, confusing, poisonous, amanita, with, an, edible, agaricus, is, the, most, frequent, cause, of, fatal, mushroom, poisonings, world, wide, reacting, to, some, distributors, marketing, dried, agaricus, or, agaricus, extract, to, cancer, patients, it, has, been, identified, by, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, as, a, fake, cancer, cure, the, species, most, often, sold, as, such, quack, cures, is, a, subrufescens, which, is, often, referred, to, by, the, erroneous, name, agaricus, blazei, and, advertised, by, fanciful, trade, names, such, as, god, s, mushroom, or, mushroom, of, life, but, can, cause, allergic, reactions, and, even, liver, damage, if, consumed, in, excessive, amounts, the, genus, contains, the, most, widely, consumed, and, best, known, mushroom, today, a, bisporus, with, a, arvensis, a, campestris, and, a, subrufescens, also, being, well, known, and, highly, regarded, a, porphyrocephalus, is, a, choice, edible, when, young, and, many, others, are, edible, as, well, namely, members, of, sections, agaricus, arvense, duploannulatae, and, sanguinolenti
