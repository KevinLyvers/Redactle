cellulose, is, an, organic, compound, with, the, formula, c, 6, h, 10, o, 5, n, a, polysaccharide, consisting, of, a, linear, chain, of, several, hundred, to, many, thousands, of, 1, 4, linked, d, glucose, units, cellulose, is, an, important, structural, component, of, the, primary, cell, wall, of, green, plants, many, forms, of, algae, and, the, oomycetes, some, species, of, bacteria, secrete, it, to, form, biofilms, cellulose, is, the, most, abundant, organic, polymer, on, earth, the, cellulose, content, of, cotton, fiber, is, 90, that, of, wood, is, 40, 50, and, that, of, dried, hemp, is, approximately, 57, cellulose, is, mainly, used, to, produce, paperboard, and, paper, smaller, quantities, are, converted, into, a, wide, variety, of, derivative, products, such, as, cellophane, and, rayon, conversion, of, cellulose, from, energy, crops, into, biofuels, such, as, cellulosic, ethanol, is, under, development, as, a, renewable, fuel, source, cellulose, for, industrial, use, is, mainly, obtained, from, wood, pulp, and, cotton, cellulose, is, also, greatly, affected, by, direct, interaction, with, several, organic, liquids, some, animals, particularly, ruminants, and, termites, can, digest, cellulose, with, the, help, of, symbiotic, micro, organisms, that, live, in, their, guts, such, as, trichonympha, in, human, nutrition, cellulose, is, a, non, digestible, constituent, of, insoluble, dietary, fiber, acting, as, a, hydrophilic, bulking, agent, for, feces, and, potentially, aiding, in, defecation, cellulose, was, discovered, in, 1838, by, the, french, chemist, anselme, payen, who, isolated, it, from, plant, matter, and, determined, its, chemical, formula, cellulose, was, used, to, produce, the, first, successful, thermoplastic, polymer, celluloid, by, hyatt, manufacturing, company, in, 1870, production, of, rayon, artificial, silk, from, cellulose, began, in, the, 1890s, and, cellophane, was, invented, in, 1912, hermann, staudinger, determined, the, polymer, structure, of, cellulose, in, 1920, the, compound, was, first, chemically, synthesized, without, the, use, of, any, biologically, derived, enzymes, in, 1992, by, kobayashi, and, shoda, cellulose, has, no, taste, is, odorless, is, hydrophilic, with, the, contact, angle, of, 20, 30, degrees, is, insoluble, in, water, and, most, organic, solvents, is, chiral, and, is, biodegradable, it, was, shown, to, melt, at, 467, c, in, pulse, tests, made, by, dauenhauer, et, al, 2016, it, can, be, broken, down, chemically, into, its, glucose, units, by, treating, it, with, concentrated, mineral, acids, at, high, temperature, cellulose, is, derived, from, d, glucose, units, which, condense, through, 1, 4, glycosidic, bonds, this, linkage, motif, contrasts, with, that, for, 1, 4, glycosidic, bonds, present, in, starch, and, glycogen, cellulose, is, a, straight, chain, polymer, unlike, starch, no, coiling, or, branching, occurs, and, the, molecule, adopts, an, extended, and, rather, stiff, rod, like, conformation, aided, by, the, equatorial, conformation, of, the, glucose, residues, the, multiple, hydroxyl, groups, on, the, glucose, from, one, chain, form, hydrogen, bonds, with, oxygen, atoms, on, the, same, or, on, a, neighbor, chain, holding, the, chains, firmly, together, side, by, side, and, forming, microfibrils, with, high, tensile, strength, this, confers, tensile, strength, in, cell, walls, where, cellulose, microfibrils, are, meshed, into, a, polysaccharide, matrix, the, high, tensile, strength, of, plant, stems, and, of, the, tree, wood, also, arises, from, the, arrangement, of, cellulose, fibers, intimately, distributed, into, the, lignin, matrix, the, mechanical, role, of, cellulose, fibers, in, the, wood, matrix, responsible, for, its, strong, structural, resistance, can, somewhat, be, compared, to, that, of, the, reinforcement, bars, in, concrete, lignin, playing, here, the, role, of, the, hardened, cement, paste, acting, as, the, glue, in, between, the, cellulose, fibers, mechanical, properties, of, cellulose, in, primary, plant, cell, wall, are, correlated, with, growth, and, expansion, of, plant, cells, live, fluorescence, microscopy, techniques, are, promising, in, investigation, of, the, role, of, cellulose, in, growing, plant, cells, compared, to, starch, cellulose, is, also, much, more, crystalline, whereas, starch, undergoes, a, crystalline, to, amorphous, transition, when, heated, beyond, 60, 70, c, in, water, as, in, cooking, cellulose, requires, a, temperature, of, 320, c, and, pressure, of, 25, mpa, to, become, amorphous, in, water, several, types, of, cellulose, are, known, these, forms, are, distinguished, according, to, the, location, of, hydrogen, bonds, between, and, within, strands, natural, cellulose, is, cellulose, i, with, structures, i, and, i, cellulose, produced, by, bacteria, and, algae, is, enriched, in, i, while, cellulose, of, higher, plants, consists, mainly, of, i, cellulose, in, regenerated, cellulose, fibers, is, cellulose, ii, the, conversion, of, cellulose, i, to, cellulose, ii, is, irreversible, suggesting, that, cellulose, i, is, metastable, and, cellulose, ii, is, stable, with, various, chemical, treatments, it, is, possible, to, produce, the, structures, cellulose, iii, and, cellulose, iv, many, properties, of, cellulose, depend, on, its, chain, length, or, degree, of, polymerization, the, number, of, glucose, units, that, make, up, one, polymer, molecule, cellulose, from, wood, pulp, has, typical, chain, lengths, between, 300, and, 1700, units, cotton, and, other, plant, fibers, as, well, as, bacterial, cellulose, have, chain, lengths, ranging, from, 800, to, 10, 000, units, molecules, with, very, small, chain, length, resulting, from, the, breakdown, of, cellulose, are, known, as, cellodextrins, in, contrast, to, long, chain, cellulose, cellodextrins, are, typically, soluble, in, water, and, organic, solvents, the, chemical, formula, of, cellulose, is, c, 6, h, 10, o, 5, n, where, n, is, the, degree, of, polymerization, and, represents, the, number, of, glucose, groups, plant, derived, cellulose, is, usually, found, in, a, mixture, with, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin, and, other, substances, while, bacterial, cellulose, is, quite, pure, has, a, much, higher, water, content, and, higher, tensile, strength, due, to, higher, chain, lengths, 3384, cellulose, consists, of, fibrils, with, crystalline, and, amorphous, regions, these, cellulose, fibrils, may, be, individualized, by, mechanical, treatment, of, cellulose, pulp, often, assisted, by, chemical, oxidation, or, enzymatic, treatment, yielding, semi, flexible, cellulose, nanofibrils, generally, 200, nm, to, 1, m, in, length, depending, on, the, treatment, intensity, cellulose, pulp, may, also, be, treated, with, strong, acid, to, hydrolyze, the, amorphous, fibril, regions, thereby, producing, short, rigid, cellulose, nanocrystals, a, few, 100, nm, in, length, these, nanocelluloses, are, of, high, technological, interest, due, to, their, self, assembly, into, cholesteric, liquid, crystals, production, of, hydrogels, or, aerogels, use, in, nanocomposites, with, superior, thermal, and, mechanical, properties, and, use, as, pickering, stabilizers, for, emulsions, in, plants, cellulose, is, synthesized, at, the, plasma, membrane, by, rosette, terminal, complexes, rtcs, the, rtcs, are, hexameric, protein, structures, approximately, 25, nm, in, diameter, that, contain, the, cellulose, synthase, enzymes, that, synthesise, the, individual, cellulose, chains, each, rtc, floats, in, the, cell, s, plasma, membrane, and, spins, a, microfibril, into, the, cell, wall, rtcs, contain, at, least, three, different, cellulose, synthases, encoded, by, cesa, ces, is, short, for, cellulose, synthase, genes, in, an, unknown, stoichiometry, separate, sets, of, cesa, genes, are, involved, in, primary, and, secondary, cell, wall, biosynthesis, there, are, known, to, be, about, seven, subfamilies, in, the, plant, cesa, superfamily, some, of, which, include, the, more, cryptic, tentatively, named, csl, cellulose, synthase, like, enzymes, these, cellulose, syntheses, use, udp, glucose, to, form, the, 1, 4, linked, cellulose, bacterial, cellulose, is, produced, using, the, same, family, of, proteins, although, the, gene, is, called, bcsa, for, bacterial, cellulose, synthase, or, cela, for, cellulose, in, many, instances, in, fact, plants, acquired, cesa, from, the, endosymbiosis, event, that, produced, the, chloroplast, all, cellulose, synthases, known, belongs, to, glucosyltransferase, family, 2, gt2, cellulose, synthesis, requires, chain, initiation, and, elongation, and, the, two, processes, are, separate, cellulose, synthase, cesa, initiates, cellulose, polymerization, using, a, steroid, primer, sitosterol, beta, glucoside, and, udp, glucose, it, then, utilizes, udp, d, glucose, precursors, to, elongate, the, growing, cellulose, chain, a, cellulase, may, function, to, cleave, the, primer, from, the, mature, chain, cellulose, is, also, synthesised, by, tunicate, animals, particularly, in, the, tests, of, ascidians, where, the, cellulose, was, historically, termed, tunicine, tunicin, cellulolysis, is, the, process, of, breaking, down, cellulose, into, smaller, polysaccharides, called, cellodextrins, or, completely, into, glucose, units, this, is, a, hydrolysis, reaction, because, cellulose, molecules, bind, strongly, to, each, other, cellulolysis, is, relatively, difficult, compared, to, the, breakdown, of, other, polysaccharides, however, this, process, can, be, significantly, intensified, in, a, proper, solvent, e, g, in, an, ionic, liquid, most, mammals, have, limited, ability, to, digest, dietary, fiber, such, as, cellulose, some, ruminants, like, cows, and, sheep, contain, certain, symbiotic, anaerobic, bacteria, such, as, cellulomonas, and, ruminococcus, spp, in, the, flora, of, the, rumen, and, these, bacteria, produce, enzymes, called, cellulases, that, hydrolyze, cellulose, the, breakdown, products, are, then, used, by, the, bacteria, for, proliferation, the, bacterial, mass, is, later, digested, by, the, ruminant, in, its, digestive, system, stomach, and, small, intestine, horses, use, cellulose, in, their, diet, by, fermentation, in, their, hindgut, some, termites, contain, in, their, hindguts, certain, flagellate, protozoa, producing, such, enzymes, whereas, others, contain, bacteria, or, may, produce, cellulase, the, enzymes, used, to, cleave, the, glycosidic, linkage, in, cellulose, are, glycoside, hydrolases, including, endo, acting, cellulases, and, exo, acting, glucosidases, such, enzymes, are, usually, secreted, as, part, of, multienzyme, complexes, that, may, include, dockerins, and, carbohydrate, binding, modules, at, temperatures, above, 350, c, cellulose, undergoes, thermolysis, also, called, pyrolysis, decomposing, into, solid, char, vapors, aerosols, and, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, maximum, yield, of, vapors, which, condense, to, a, liquid, called, bio, oil, is, obtained, at, 500, c, semi, crystalline, cellulose, polymers, react, at, pyrolysis, temperatures, 350, 600, c, in, a, few, seconds, this, transformation, has, been, shown, to, occur, via, a, solid, to, liquid, to, vapor, transition, with, the, liquid, called, intermediate, liquid, cellulose, or, molten, cellulose, existing, for, only, a, fraction, of, a, second, glycosidic, bond, cleavage, produces, short, cellulose, chains, of, two, to, seven, monomers, comprising, the, melt, vapor, bubbling, of, intermediate, liquid, cellulose, produces, aerosols, which, consist, of, short, chain, anhydro, oligomers, derived, from, the, melt, continuing, decomposition, of, molten, cellulose, produces, volatile, compounds, including, levoglucosan, furans, pyrans, light, oxygenates, and, gases, via, primary, reactions, within, thick, cellulose, samples, volatile, compounds, such, as, levoglucosan, undergo, secondary, reactions, to, volatile, products, including, pyrans, and, light, oxygenates, such, as, glycolaldehyde, hemicelluloses, are, polysaccharides, related, to, cellulose, that, comprises, about, 20, of, the, biomass, of, land, plants, in, contrast, to, cellulose, hemicelluloses, are, derived, from, several, sugars, in, addition, to, glucose, especially, xylose, but, also, including, mannose, galactose, rhamnose, and, arabinose, hemicelluloses, consist, of, shorter, chains, between, 500, and, 3000, sugar, units, furthermore, hemicelluloses, are, branched, whereas, cellulose, is, unbranched, cellulose, is, soluble, in, several, kinds, of, media, several, of, which, are, the, basis, of, commercial, technologies, these, dissolution, processes, are, reversible, and, are, used, in, the, production, of, regenerated, celluloses, such, as, viscose, and, cellophane, from, dissolving, pulp, the, most, important, solubilizing, agent, is, carbon, disulfide, in, the, presence, of, alkali, other, agents, include, schweizer, s, reagent, n, methylmorpholine, n, oxide, and, lithium, chloride, in, dimethylacetamide, in, general, these, agents, modify, the, cellulose, rendering, it, soluble, the, agents, are, then, removed, concomitant, with, the, formation, of, fibers, cellulose, is, also, soluble, in, many, kinds, of, ionic, liquids, the, history, of, regenerated, cellulose, is, often, cited, as, beginning, with, george, audemars, who, first, manufactured, regenerated, nitrocellulose, fibers, in, 1855, although, these, fibers, were, soft, and, strong, resembling, silk, they, had, the, drawback, of, being, highly, flammable, hilaire, de, chardonnet, perfected, production, of, nitrocellulose, fibers, but, manufacturing, of, these, fibers, by, his, process, was, relatively, uneconomical, in, 1890, l, h, despeissis, invented, the, cuprammonium, process, which, uses, a, cuprammonium, solution, to, solubilize, cellulose, a, method, still, used, today, for, production, of, artificial, silk, in, 1891, it, was, discovered, that, treatment, of, cellulose, with, alkali, and, carbon, disulfide, generated, a, soluble, cellulose, derivative, known, as, viscose, this, process, patented, by, the, founders, of, the, viscose, development, company, is, the, most, widely, used, method, for, manufacturing, regenerated, cellulose, products, courtaulds, purchased, the, patents, for, this, process, in, 1904, leading, to, significant, growth, of, viscose, fiber, production, by, 1931, expiration, of, patents, for, the, viscose, process, led, to, its, adoption, worldwide, global, production, of, regenerated, cellulose, fiber, peaked, in, 1973, at, 3, 856, 000, tons, regenerated, cellulose, can, be, used, to, manufacture, a, wide, variety, of, products, while, the, first, application, of, regenerated, cellulose, was, as, a, clothing, textile, this, class, of, materials, is, also, used, in, the, production, of, disposable, medical, devices, as, well, as, fabrication, of, artificial, membranes, the, hydroxyl, groups, oh, of, cellulose, can, be, partially, or, fully, reacted, with, various, reagents, to, afford, derivatives, with, useful, properties, like, mainly, cellulose, esters, and, cellulose, ethers, or, in, principle, although, not, always, in, current, industrial, practice, cellulosic, polymers, are, renewable, resources, ester, derivatives, include, cellulose, acetate, and, cellulose, triacetate, are, film, and, fiber, forming, materials, that, find, a, variety, of, uses, nitrocellulose, was, initially, used, as, an, explosive, and, was, an, early, film, forming, material, when, plasticized, with, camphor, nitrocellulose, gives, celluloid, cellulose, ether, derivatives, include, the, sodium, carboxymethyl, cellulose, can, be, cross, linked, to, give, the, croscarmellose, sodium, e468, for, use, as, a, disintegrant, in, pharmaceutical, formulations, furthermore, by, the, covalent, attachment, of, thiol, groups, to, cellulose, ethers, such, as, sodium, carboxymethyl, cellulose, ethyl, cellulose, or, hydroxyethyl, cellulose, mucoadhesive, and, permeation, enhancing, properties, can, be, introduced, thiolated, cellulose, derivatives, see, thiomers, exhibit, also, high, binding, properties, for, metal, ions, cellulose, for, industrial, use, is, mainly, obtained, from, wood, pulp, and, from, cotton, energy, crops, the, major, combustible, component, of, non, food, energy, crops, is, cellulose, with, lignin, second, non, food, energy, crops, produce, more, usable, energy, than, edible, energy, crops, which, have, a, large, starch, component, but, still, compete, with, food, crops, for, agricultural, land, and, water, resources, typical, non, food, energy, crops, include, industrial, hemp, switchgrass, miscanthus, salix, willow, and, populus, poplar, species, a, strain, of, clostridium, bacteria, found, in, zebra, dung, can, convert, nearly, any, form, of, cellulose, into, butanol, fuel, another, possible, application, is, as, insect, repellents
