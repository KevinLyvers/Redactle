homalozoa, gill, caster, 1960, crinozoa, asterozoa, echinozoa, blastozoa, extinct, an, echinoderm, k, a, n, d, r, m, k, is, any, deuterostomal, animal, of, the, phylum, echinodermata, k, a, n, o, d, r, m, t, which, includes, starfish, brittle, stars, sea, urchins, sand, dollars, and, sea, cucumbers, as, well, as, the, sessile, sea, lilies, or, stone, lilies, while, bilaterally, symmetrical, as, larvae, as, adults, echinoderms, are, recognisable, by, their, usually, five, pointed, radial, symmetry, pentamerous, symmetry, and, are, found, on, the, sea, bed, at, every, ocean, depth, from, the, intertidal, zone, to, the, abyssal, zone, the, phylum, contains, about, 7, 600, living, species, making, it, the, second, largest, group, of, deuterostomes, after, the, chordates, as, well, as, the, largest, marine, only, phylum, the, first, definitive, echinoderms, appeared, near, the, start, of, the, cambrian, the, echinoderms, are, important, both, ecologically, and, geologically, ecologically, there, are, few, other, groupings, so, abundant, in, the, biotic, desert, of, the, deep, sea, as, well, as, shallower, oceans, most, echinoderms, are, able, to, reproduce, asexually, and, regenerate, tissue, organs, and, limbs, in, some, cases, they, can, undergo, complete, regeneration, from, a, single, limb, geologically, the, value, of, echinoderms, is, in, their, ossified, dermal, endoskeletons, which, are, major, contributors, to, many, limestone, formations, and, can, provide, valuable, clues, as, to, the, geological, environment, they, were, the, most, used, species, in, regenerative, research, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, further, some, scientists, hold, that, the, radiation, of, echinoderms, was, responsible, for, the, mesozoic, marine, revolution, the, name, echinoderm, is, from, ancient, greek, ekh, nos, hedgehog, and, d, rma, skin, echinoderms, are, bilaterians, meaning, that, their, ancestors, were, mirror, symmetric, among, the, bilaterians, they, belong, to, the, deuterostome, division, meaning, that, the, blastopore, the, first, opening, to, form, during, embryo, development, becomes, the, anus, instead, of, the, mouth, the, characteristics, of, adult, echinoderms, are, the, possession, of, a, water, vascular, system, with, external, tube, feet, and, a, calcareous, endoskeleton, consisting, of, ossicles, connected, by, a, mesh, of, collagen, fibres, historically, taxonomists, believed, that, the, ophiuroidea, were, sister, to, the, asteroidea, as, the, clade, asterozoa, or, that, they, were, sister, to, the, holothuroidea, echinoidea, as, the, clade, cryptosyringida, however, a, 2014, analysis, of, 219, genes, from, all, classes, of, echinoderms, resulted, in, strong, support, for, asterozoa, an, independent, analysis, in, 2015, of, rna, transcriptomes, from, 23, species, across, all, classes, of, echinoderms, gave, the, same, tree, the, context, of, the, echinoderms, within, the, bilateria, is, xenacoelomorpha, chordata, echinodermata, hemichordata, ecdysozoa, spiralia, crinoidea, feather, stars, there, are, about, 7, 600, extant, species, of, echinoderm, as, well, as, about, 13, 000, extinct, species, all, echinoderms, are, marine, but, they, are, found, in, habitats, ranging, from, shallow, intertidal, areas, to, abyssal, depths, two, main, subdivisions, are, traditionally, recognised, the, more, familiar, motile, eleutherozoa, which, encompasses, the, asteroidea, starfish, with, some, 1, 745, species, ophiuroidea, brittle, stars, with, around, 2, 300, species, echinoidea, sea, urchins, and, sand, dollars, with, some, 900, species, and, holothuroidea, sea, cucumbers, with, about, 1, 430, species, and, the, pelmatozoa, some, of, which, are, sessile, while, others, are, motile, these, consist, of, the, crinoidea, feather, stars, and, sea, lilies, with, around, 580, species, and, the, extinct, blastoids, and, paracrinoids, the, oldest, candidate, echinoderm, fossil, is, arkarua, from, the, precambrian, of, australia, these, fossils, are, disc, like, with, radial, ridges, on, the, rim, and, a, five, pointed, central, depression, marked, with, radial, lines, however, the, fossils, have, no, stereom, or, internal, structure, indicating, a, water, vascular, system, so, they, cannot, be, conclusively, identified, the, first, universally, accepted, echinoderms, appear, in, the, lower, cambrian, period, asterozoans, appeared, in, the, ordovician, while, the, crinoids, were, a, dominant, group, in, the, paleozoic, echinoderms, left, behind, an, extensive, fossil, record, it, is, hypothesised, that, the, ancestor, of, all, echinoderms, was, a, simple, motile, bilaterally, symmetrical, animal, with, a, mouth, gut, and, anus, this, ancestral, organism, adopted, an, attached, mode, of, life, with, suspension, feeding, and, developed, radial, symmetry, even, so, the, larvae, of, all, echinoderms, are, bilaterally, symmetrical, and, all, develop, radial, symmetry, at, metamorphosis, like, their, ancestor, the, starfish, and, crinoids, still, attach, themselves, to, the, seabed, while, changing, to, their, adult, form, the, first, echinoderms, were, non, motile, but, evolved, into, animals, able, to, move, freely, these, soon, developed, endoskeletal, plates, with, stereom, structure, and, external, ciliary, grooves, for, feeding, the, paleozoic, echinoderms, were, globular, attached, to, the, substrate, and, were, orientated, with, their, oral, surfaces, facing, upwards, these, early, echinoderms, had, ambulacral, grooves, extending, down, the, side, of, the, body, fringed, on, either, side, by, brachioles, like, the, pinnules, of, a, modern, crinoid, eventually, except, for, the, crinoids, all, the, classes, of, echinoderms, reversed, their, orientation, to, become, mouth, downward, before, this, happened, the, podia, probably, had, a, feeding, function, as, they, do, in, the, crinoids, today, the, locomotor, function, of, the, podia, came, later, when, the, re, orientation, of, the, mouth, brought, the, podia, into, contact, with, the, substrate, for, the, first, time, echinoderms, evolved, from, animals, with, bilateral, symmetry, although, adult, echinoderms, possess, pentaradial, symmetry, their, larvae, are, ciliated, free, swimming, organisms, with, bilateral, symmetry, later, during, metamorphosis, the, left, side, of, the, body, grows, at, the, expense, of, the, right, side, which, is, eventually, absorbed, the, left, side, then, grows, in, a, pentaradially, symmetric, fashion, in, which, the, body, is, arranged, in, five, parts, around, a, central, axis, within, the, asterozoa, there, can, be, a, few, exceptions, from, the, rule, most, starfish, in, the, genus, leptasterias, have, six, arms, although, five, armed, individuals, can, occur, the, brisingida, also, contain, some, six, armed, species, amongst, the, brittle, stars, six, armed, species, such, as, ophiothela, danae, ophiactis, savignyi, and, ophionotus, hexactis, exists, and, ophiacantha, vivipara, often, has, more, than, six, echinoderms, have, secondary, radial, symmetry, in, portions, of, their, body, at, some, stage, of, life, most, likely, an, adaptation, to, a, sessile, or, slow, moving, existence, many, crinoids, and, some, seastars, are, symmetrical, in, multiples, of, the, basic, five, starfish, such, as, labidiaster, annulatus, possess, up, to, fifty, arms, while, the, sea, lily, comaster, schlegelii, has, two, hundred, genetic, studies, have, showed, that, genes, which, direct, the, development, of, the, trunk, region, is, absent, during, the, development, only, known, exception, is, a, gene, active, at, the, tip, of, the, sea, stars, arms, indicating, that, their, body, consists, of, just, a, developed, head, region, echinoderms, have, a, mesodermal, skeleton, in, the, dermis, composed, of, calcite, based, plates, known, as, ossicles, if, solid, these, would, form, a, heavy, skeleton, so, they, have, a, sponge, like, porous, structure, known, as, stereom, ossicles, may, be, fused, together, as, in, the, test, of, sea, urchins, or, may, articulate, to, form, flexible, joints, as, in, the, arms, of, sea, stars, brittle, stars, and, crinoids, the, ossicles, may, bear, external, projections, in, the, form, of, spines, granules, or, warts, and, they, are, supported, by, a, tough, epidermis, skeletal, elements, are, sometimes, deployed, in, specialized, ways, such, as, the, chewing, organ, called, aristotle, s, lantern, in, sea, urchins, the, supportive, stalks, of, crinoids, and, the, structural, lime, ring, of, sea, cucumbers, although, individual, ossicles, are, robust, and, fossilize, readily, complete, skeletons, of, starfish, brittle, stars, and, crinoids, are, rare, in, the, fossil, record, on, the, other, hand, sea, urchins, are, often, well, preserved, in, chalk, beds, or, limestone, during, fossilization, the, cavities, in, the, stereom, are, filled, in, with, calcite, that, is, continuous, with, the, surrounding, rock, on, fracturing, such, rock, paleontologists, can, observe, distinctive, cleavage, patterns, and, sometimes, even, the, intricate, internal, and, external, structure, of, the, test, the, epidermis, contains, pigment, cells, that, provide, the, often, vivid, colours, of, echinoderms, which, include, deep, red, stripes, of, black, and, white, and, intense, purple, these, cells, may, be, light, sensitive, causing, many, echinoderms, to, change, appearance, completely, as, night, falls, the, reaction, can, happen, quickly, the, sea, urchin, centrostephanus, longispinus, changes, colour, in, just, fifty, minutes, when, exposed, to, light, one, characteristic, of, most, echinoderms, is, a, special, kind, of, tissue, known, as, catch, connective, tissue, this, collagen, based, material, can, change, its, mechanical, properties, under, nervous, control, rather, than, by, muscular, means, this, tissue, enables, a, starfish, to, go, from, moving, flexibly, around, the, seabed, to, becoming, rigid, while, prying, open, a, bivalve, mollusc, or, preventing, itself, from, being, extracted, from, a, crevice, similarly, sea, urchins, can, lock, their, normally, mobile, spines, upright, as, a, defensive, mechanism, when, attacked, echinoderms, possess, a, unique, water, vascular, system, a, network, of, fluid, filled, canals, modified, from, the, coelom, body, cavity, that, function, in, gas, exchange, feeding, sensory, reception, and, locomotion, this, system, varies, between, different, classes, of, echinoderm, but, typically, opens, to, the, exterior, through, a, sieve, like, madreporite, on, the, aboral, upper, surface, of, the, animal, the, madreporite, is, linked, to, a, slender, duct, the, stone, canal, which, extends, to, a, ring, canal, that, encircles, the, mouth, or, oesophagus, the, ring, canal, branches, into, a, set, of, radial, canals, which, in, asteroids, extend, along, the, arms, and, in, echinoids, adjoin, the, test, in, the, ambulacral, areas, short, lateral, canals, branch, off, the, radial, canals, each, one, ending, in, an, ampulla, part, of, the, ampulla, can, protrude, through, a, pore, or, a, pair, of, pores, in, sea, urchins, to, the, exterior, forming, a, podium, or, tube, foot, the, water, vascular, system, assists, with, the, distribution, of, nutrients, throughout, the, animal, s, body, it, is, most, visible, in, the, tube, feet, which, can, be, extended, or, contracted, by, the, redistribution, of, fluid, between, the, foot, and, the, internal, ampulla, the, organisation, of, the, water, vascular, system, is, somewhat, different, in, ophiuroids, where, the, madreporite, may, be, on, the, oral, surface, and, the, podia, lack, suckers, in, holothuroids, the, system, is, reduced, often, with, few, tube, feet, other, than, the, specialised, feeding, tentacles, and, the, madreporite, opens, on, to, the, coelom, some, holothuroids, like, the, apodida, lack, tube, feet, and, canals, along, the, body, others, have, longitudinal, canals, the, arrangement, in, crinoids, is, similar, to, that, in, asteroids, but, the, tube, feet, lack, suckers, and, are, used, in, a, back, and, forth, wafting, motion, to, pass, food, particles, captured, by, the, arms, towards, the, central, mouth, in, the, asteroids, the, same, motion, is, employed, to, move, the, animal, across, the, ground, echinoderms, possess, a, simple, digestive, system, which, varies, according, to, the, animal, s, diet, starfish, are, mostly, carnivorous, and, have, a, mouth, oesophagus, two, part, stomach, intestine, and, rectum, with, the, anus, located, in, the, centre, of, the, aboral, body, surface, with, a, few, exceptions, the, members, of, the, order, paxillosida, do, not, possess, an, anus, in, many, species, of, starfish, the, large, cardiac, stomach, can, be, everted, to, digest, food, outside, the, body, some, other, species, are, able, to, ingest, whole, food, items, such, as, molluscs, brittle, stars, which, have, varying, diets, have, a, blind, gut, with, no, intestine, or, anus, they, expel, food, waste, through, their, mouth, sea, urchins, are, herbivores, and, use, their, specialised, mouthparts, to, graze, tear, and, chew, their, food, mainly, algae, they, have, an, oesophagus, a, large, stomach, and, a, rectum, with, the, anus, at, the, apex, of, the, test, sea, cucumbers, are, mostly, detritivores, sorting, through, the, sediment, with, modified, tube, feet, around, their, mouth, the, buccal, tentacles, sand, and, mud, accompanies, their, food, through, their, simple, gut, which, has, a, long, coiled, intestine, and, a, large, cloaca, crinoids, are, suspension, feeders, passively, catching, plankton, which, drift, into, their, outstretched, arms, boluses, of, mucus, trapped, food, are, passed, to, the, mouth, which, is, linked, to, the, anus, by, a, loop, consisting, of, a, short, oesophagus, and, longer, intestine, the, coelomic, cavities, of, echinoderms, are, complex, aside, from, the, water, vascular, system, echinoderms, have, a, haemal, coelom, a, peri, visceral, coelom, a, gonadal, coelom, and, often, also, a, perihaemal, coelom, during, development, echinoderm, coelom, is, divided, into, the, metacoel, mesocoel, and, protocoel, also, called, somatocoel, hydrocoel, and, axocoel, respectively, the, water, vascular, system, haemal, system, and, perihaemal, system, form, the, tubular, coelomic, system, echinoderms, are, unusual, in, having, both, a, coelomic, circulatory, system, the, water, vascular, system, and, a, haemal, circulatory, system, as, most, groups, of, animals, have, just, one, of, the, two, haemal, and, perihaemal, systems, are, derived, from, the, original, coelom, forming, an, open, and, reduced, circulatory, system, this, usually, consists, of, a, central, ring, and, five, radial, vessels, there, is, no, true, heart, and, the, blood, often, lacks, any, respiratory, pigment, gaseous, exchange, occurs, via, dermal, branchiae, or, papulae, in, starfish, genital, bursae, in, brittle, stars, peristominal, gills, in, sea, urchins, and, cloacal, trees, in, sea, cucumbers, exchange, of, gases, also, takes, place, through, the, tube, feet, echinoderms, lack, specialized, excretory, waste, disposal, organs, and, so, nitrogenous, waste, chiefly, in, the, form, of, ammonia, diffuses, out, through, the, respiratory, surfaces, the, coelomic, fluid, contains, the, coelomocytes, or, immune, cells, there, are, several, types, of, immune, cells, which, vary, among, classes, and, species, all, classes, possess, a, type, of, phagocytic, amebocyte, which, engulf, invading, particles, and, infected, cells, aggregate, or, clot, and, may, be, involved, in, cytotoxicity, these, cells, are, usually, large, and, granular, and, are, believed, to, be, a, main, line, of, defence, against, potential, pathogens, depending, on, the, class, echinoderms, may, have, spherule, cells, for, cytotoxicity, inflammation, and, anti, bacterial, activity, vibratile, cells, for, coelomic, fluid, movement, and, clotting, and, crystal, cells, which, may, serve, for, osmoregulation, in, sea, cucumbers, the, coelomocytes, secrete, antimicrobial, peptides, against, bacteria, and, have, a, set, of, lectins, and, complement, proteins, as, part, of, an, innate, immune, system, that, is, still, being, characterised, echinoderms, have, a, simple, radial, nervous, system, that, consists, of, a, modified, nerve, net, of, interconnected, neurons, with, no, central, brain, although, some, do, possess, ganglia, nerves, radiate, from, central, rings, around, the, mouth, into, each, arm, or, along, the, body, wall, the, branches, of, these, nerves, coordinate, the, movements, of, the, organism, and, the, synchronisation, of, the, tube, feet, starfish, have, sensory, cells, in, the, epithelium, and, have, simple, eyespots, and, touch, sensitive, tentacle, like, tube, feet, at, the, tips, of, their, arms, sea, urchins, have, no, particular, sense, organs, but, do, have, statocysts, that, assist, in, gravitational, orientation, and, they, too, have, sensory, cells, in, their, epidermis, particularly, in, the, tube, feet, spines, and, pedicellariae, brittle, stars, crinoids, and, sea, cucumbers, in, general, do, not, have, sensory, organs, but, some, burrowing, sea, cucumbers, of, the, order, apodida, have, a, single, statocyst, adjoining, each, radial, nerve, and, some, have, an, eyespot, at, the, base, of, each, tentacle, the, gonads, at, least, periodically, occupy, much, of, the, body, cavities, of, sea, urchins, and, sea, cucumbers, while, the, less, voluminous, crinoids, brittle, stars, and, starfish, have, two, gonads, in, each, arm, while, the, ancestors, of, modern, echinoderms, are, believed, to, have, had, one, genital, aperture, many, organisms, have, multiple, gonopores, through, which, eggs, or, sperm, may, be, released, many, echinoderms, have, great, powers, of, regeneration, many, species, routinely, autotomize, and, regenerate, arms, and, viscera, sea, cucumbers, often, discharge, parts, of, their, internal, organs, if, they, perceive, themselves, to, be, threatened, regenerating, them, over, the, course, of, several, months, sea, urchins, constantly, replace, spines, lost, through, damage, while, sea, stars, and, sea, lilies, readily, lose, and, regenerate, their, arms, in, most, cases, a, single, severed, arm, cannot, grow, into, a, new, starfish, in, the, absence, of, at, least, part, of, the, disc, however, in, a, few, species, a, single, arm, can, survive, and, develop, into, a, complete, individual, and, arms, are, sometimes, intentionally, detached, for, the, purpose, of, asexual, reproduction, during, periods, when, they, have, lost, their, digestive, tracts, sea, cucumbers, live, off, stored, nutrients, and, absorb, dissolved, organic, matter, directly, from, the, water, the, regeneration, of, lost, parts, involves, both, epimorphosis, and, morphallaxis, in, epimorphosis, stem, cells, either, from, a, reserve, pool, or, those, produced, by, dedifferentiation, form, a, blastema, and, generate, new, tissues, morphallactic, regeneration, involves, the, movement, and, remodelling, of, existing, tissues, to, replace, lost, parts, direct, transdifferentiation, of, one, type, of, tissue, to, another, during, tissue, replacement, is, also, observed, echinoderms, become, sexually, mature, after, approximately, two, to, three, years, depending, on, the, species, and, the, environmental, conditions, almost, all, species, have, separate, male, and, female, sexes, though, some, are, hermaphroditic, the, eggs, and, sperm, cells, are, typically, released, into, open, water, where, fertilisation, takes, place, the, release, of, sperm, and, eggs, is, synchronised, in, some, species, usually, with, regard, to, the, lunar, cycle, in, other, species, individuals, may, aggregate, during, the, reproductive, season, increasing, the, likelihood, of, successful, fertilisation, internal, fertilisation, has, been, observed, in, three, species, of, sea, star, three, brittle, stars, and, a, deep, water, sea, cucumber, even, at, abyssal, depths, where, no, light, penetrates, echinoderms, often, synchronise, their, reproductive, activity, some, echinoderms, brood, their, eggs, this, is, especially, common, in, cold, water, species, where, planktonic, larvae, might, not, be, able, to, find, sufficient, food, these, retained, eggs, are, usually, few, in, number, and, are, supplied, with, large, yolks, to, nourish, the, developing, embryos, in, starfish, the, female, may, carry, the, eggs, in, special, pouches, under, her, arms, under, her, arched, body, or, even, in, her, cardiac, stomach, many, brittle, stars, are, hermaphrodites, they, often, brood, their, eggs, usually, in, special, chambers, on, their, oral, surfaces, but, sometimes, in, the, ovary, or, coelom, in, these, starfish, and, brittle, stars, development, is, usually, direct, to, the, adult, form, without, passing, through, a, bilateral, larval, stage, a, few, sea, urchins, and, one, species, of, sand, dollar, carry, their, eggs, in, cavities, or, near, their, anus, holding, them, in, place, with, their, spines, some, sea, cucumbers, use, their, buccal, tentacles, to, transfer, their, eggs, to, their, underside, or, back, where, they, are, retained, in, a, very, small, number, of, species, the, eggs, are, retained, in, the, coelom, where, they, develop, viviparously, later, emerging, through, ruptures, in, the, body, wall, in, some, crinoids, the, embryos, develop, in, special, breeding, bags, where, the, eggs, are, held, until, sperm, released, by, a, male, happens, to, find, them, one, species, of, seastar, ophidiaster, granifer, reproduces, asexually, by, parthenogenesis, in, certain, other, asterozoans, adults, reproduce, asexually, until, they, mature, then, reproduce, sexually, in, most, of, these, species, asexual, reproduction, is, by, transverse, fission, with, the, disc, splitting, in, two, both, the, lost, disc, area, and, the, missing, arms, regrow, so, an, individual, may, have, arms, of, varying, lengths, during, the, period, of, regrowth, they, have, a, few, tiny, arms, and, one, large, arm, and, are, thus, often, known, as, comets, adult, sea, cucumbers, reproduce, asexually, by, transverse, fission, holothuria, parvula, uses, this, method, frequently, splitting, into, two, a, little, in, front, of, the, midpoint, the, two, halves, each, regenerate, their, missing, organs, over, a, period, of, several, months, but, the, missing, genital, organs, are, often, very, slow, to, develop, the, larvae, of, some, echinoderms, are, capable, of, asexual, reproduction, this, has, long, been, known, to, occur, among, starfish, and, brittle, stars, but, has, more, recently, been, observed, in, a, sea, cucumber, a, sand, dollar, and, a, sea, urchin, this, may, be, by, autotomising, parts, that, develop, into, secondary, larvae, by, budding, or, by, splitting, transversely, autotomised, parts, or, buds, may, develop, directly, into, fully, formed, larvae, or, may, pass, through, a, gastrula, or, even, a, blastula, stage, new, larvae, can, develop, from, the, preoral, hood, a, mound, like, structure, above, the, mouth, the, side, body, wall, the, postero, lateral, arms, or, their, rear, ends, cloning, is, costly, to, the, larva, both, in, resources, and, in, development, time, larvae, undergo, this, process, when, food, is, plentiful, or, temperature, conditions, are, optimal, cloning, may, occur, to, make, use, of, the, tissues, that, are, normally, lost, during, metamorphosis, the, larvae, of, some, sand, dollars, clone, themselves, when, they, detect, dissolved, fish, mucus, indicating, the, presence, of, predators, asexual, reproduction, produces, many, smaller, larvae, that, escape, better, from, planktivorous, fish, implying, that, the, mechanism, may, be, an, anti, predator, adaptation, development, begins, with, a, bilaterally, symmetrical, embryo, with, a, coeloblastula, developing, first, gastrulation, marks, the, opening, of, the, second, mouth, that, places, echinoderms, within, the, deuterostomes, and, the, mesoderm, which, will, host, the, skeleton, migrates, inwards, the, secondary, body, cavity, the, coelom, forms, by, the, partitioning, of, three, body, cavities, the, larvae, are, often, planktonic, but, in, some, species, the, eggs, are, retained, inside, the, female, while, in, some, the, female, broods, the, larvae, the, larvae, pass, through, several, stages, which, have, specific, names, derived, from, the, taxonomic, names, of, the, adults, or, from, their, appearance, for, example, a, sea, urchin, has, an, echinopluteus, larva, while, a, brittle, star, has, an, ophiopluteus, larva, a, starfish, has, a, bipinnaria, larva, which, develops, into, a, multi, armed, brachiolaria, larva, a, sea, cucumber, s, larva, is, an, auricularia, while, a, crinoid, s, is, a, vitellaria, all, these, larvae, are, bilaterally, symmetrical, and, have, bands, of, cilia, with, which, they, swim, some, usually, known, as, pluteus, larvae, have, arms, when, fully, developed, they, settle, on, the, seabed, to, undergo, metamorphosis, and, the, larval, arms, and, gut, degenerate, the, left, hand, side, of, the, larva, develops, into, the, oral, surface, of, the, juvenile, while, the, right, side, becomes, the, aboral, surface, at, this, stage, the, pentaradial, symmetry, develops, a, plankton, eating, larva, living, and, feeding, in, the, water, column, is, considered, to, be, the, ancestral, larval, type, for, echinoderms, but, in, extant, echinoderms, some, 68, of, species, develop, using, a, yolk, feeding, larva, the, provision, of, a, yolk, sac, means, that, smaller, numbers, of, eggs, are, produced, the, larvae, have, a, shorter, development, period, and, a, smaller, dispersal, potential, but, a, greater, chance, of, survival, echinoderms, are, globally, distributed, in, almost, all, depths, latitudes, and, environments, in, the, ocean, adults, are, mainly, benthic, living, on, the, seabed, whereas, larvae, are, often, pelagic, living, as, plankton, in, the, open, ocean, some, holothuroid, adults, such, as, pelagothuria, are, however, pelagic, some, crinoids, are, pseudo, planktonic, attaching, themselves, to, floating, logs, and, debris, although, this, behaviour, was, exercised, most, extensively, in, the, paleozoic, before, competition, from, organisms, such, as, barnacles, restricted, the, extent, of, the, behaviour, echinoderms, primarily, use, their, tube, feet, to, move, about, though, some, sea, urchins, also, use, their, spines, the, tube, feet, typically, have, a, tip, shaped, like, a, suction, pad, in, which, a, vacuum, can, be, created, by, contraction, of, muscles, this, combines, with, some, stickiness, from, the, secretion, of, mucus, to, provide, adhesion, the, tube, feet, contract, and, relax, in, waves, which, move, along, the, adherent, surface, and, the, animal, moves, slowly, along, brittle, stars, are, the, most, agile, of, the, echinoderms, any, one, of, the, arms, can, form, the, axis, of, symmetry, pointing, either, forwards, or, back, the, animal, then, moves, in, a, co, ordinated, way, propelled, by, the, other, four, arms, during, locomotion, the, propelling, arms, can, made, either, snake, like, or, rowing, movements, starfish, move, using, their, tube, feet, keeping, their, arms, almost, still, including, in, genera, like, pycnopodia, where, the, arms, are, flexible, the, oral, surface, is, covered, with, thousands, of, tube, feet, which, move, out, of, time, with, each, other, but, not, in, a, metachronal, rhythm, in, some, way, however, the, tube, feet, are, coordinated, as, the, animal, glides, steadily, along, some, burrowing, starfish, have, points, rather, than, suckers, on, their, tube, feet, and, they, are, able, to, glide, across, the, seabed, at, a, faster, rate, sea, urchins, use, their, tube, feet, to, move, around, in, a, similar, way, to, starfish, some, also, use, their, articulated, spines, to, push, or, lever, themselves, along, or, lift, their, oral, surfaces, off, the, substrate, if, a, sea, urchin, is, overturned, it, can, extend, its, tube, feet, in, one, ambulacral, area, far, enough, to, bring, them, within, reach, of, the, substrate, and, then, successively, attach, feet, from, the, adjoining, area, until, it, is, righted, some, species, bore, into, rock, usually, by, grinding, away, at, the, surface, with, their, mouthparts, sea, cucumbers, are, generally, sluggish, animals, many, can, move, on, the, surface, of, the, seabed, or, burrow, through, sand, or, mud, using, peristaltic, movements, some, have, short, tube, feet, on, their, under, surface, with, which, they, can, creep, along, in, the, manner, of, a, starfish, some, species, drag, themselves, along, using, their, buccal, tentacles, while, others, manage, to, swim, with, peristaltic, movements, or, rhythmic, flexing, many, live, in, cracks, hollows, and, burrows, and, hardly, move, at, all, some, deep, water, species, are, pelagic, and, can, float, in, the, water, with, webbed, papillae, forming, sails, or, fins, the, majority, of, crinoids, are, motile, but, sea, lilies, are, sessile, and, attached, to, hard, substrates, by, stalks, movement, in, most, sea, lilies, is, limited, to, bending, their, stems, can, bend, and, rolling, and, unrolling, their, arms, a, few, species, can, relocate, themselves, on, the, seabed, by, crawling, the, sea, feathers, are, unattached, and, usually, live, in, crevices, under, corals, or, inside, sponges, with, their, arms, the, only, visible, part, some, sea, feathers, emerge, at, night, and, perch, themselves, on, nearby, eminences, to, better, exploit, food, bearing, currents, many, species, can, walk, across, the, seabed, raising, their, body, with, the, help, of, their, arms, or, swim, using, their, arms, most, species, of, sea, feather, however, are, largely, sedentary, seldom, moving, far, from, their, chosen, place, of, concealment, the, modes, of, feeding, vary, greatly, between, the, different, echinoderm, taxa, crinoids, and, some, brittle, stars, tend, to, be, passive, filter, feeders, enmeshing, suspended, particles, from, passing, water, most, sea, urchins, are, grazers, sea, cucumbers, are, deposit, feeders, and, the, majority, of, starfish, are, active, hunters, crinoids, catch, food, particles, using, the, tube, feet, on, their, outspread, pinnules, move, them, into, the, ambulacral, grooves, wrap, them, in, mucus, and, convey, them, to, the, mouth, using, the, cilia, lining, the, grooves, the, exact, dietary, requirements, of, crinoids, have, been, little, researched, but, in, the, laboratory, they, can, be, fed, with, diatoms, basket, stars, are, suspension, feeders, raising, their, branched, arms, to, collect, zooplankton, while, other, brittle, stars, use, several, methods, of, feeding, some, are, suspension, feeders, securing, food, particles, with, mucus, strands, spines, or, tube, feet, on, their, raised, arms, others, are, scavengers, and, detritus, feeders, others, again, are, voracious, carnivores, and, able, to, lasso, their, waterborne, prey, with, a, sudden, encirclement, by, their, flexible, arms, the, limbs, then, bend, under, the, disc, to, transfer, the, food, to, the, jaws, and, mouth, many, sea, urchins, feed, on, algae, often, scraping, off, the, thin, layer, of, algae, covering, the, surfaces, of, rocks, with, their, specialised, mouthparts, known, as, aristotle, s, lantern, other, species, devour, smaller, organisms, which, they, may, catch, with, their, tube, feet, they, may, also, feed, on, dead, fish, and, other, animal, matter, sand, dollars, may, perform, suspension, feeding, and, feed, on, phytoplankton, detritus, algal, pieces, and, the, bacterial, layer, surrounding, grains, of, sand, sea, cucumbers, are, often, mobile, deposit, or, suspension, feeders, using, their, buccal, podia, to, actively, capture, food, and, then, stuffing, the, particles, individually, into, their, buccal, cavities, others, ingest, large, quantities, of, sediment, absorb, the, organic, matter, and, pass, the, indigestible, mineral, particles, through, their, guts, in, this, way, they, disturb, and, process, large, volumes, of, substrate, often, leaving, characteristic, ridges, of, sediment, on, the, seabed, some, sea, cucumbers, live, infaunally, in, burrows, anterior, end, down, and, anus, on, the, surface, swallowing, sediment, and, passing, it, through, their, gut, other, burrowers, live, anterior, end, up, and, wait, for, detritus, to, fall, into, the, entrances, of, the, burrows, or, rake, in, debris, from, the, surface, nearby, with, their, buccal, podia, nearly, all, starfish, are, detritus, feeders, or, carnivores, though, a, few, are, suspension, feeders, small, fish, landing, on, the, upper, surface, may, be, captured, by, pedicilaria, and, dead, animal, matter, may, be, scavenged, but, the, main, prey, items, are, living, invertebrates, mostly, bivalve, molluscs, to, feed, on, one, of, these, the, starfish, moves, over, it, attaches, its, tube, feet, and, exerts, pressure, on, the, valves, by, arching, its, back, when, a, small, gap, between, the, valves, is, formed, the, starfish, inserts, part, of, its, stomach, into, the, prey, excretes, digestive, enzymes, and, slowly, liquefies, the, soft, body, parts, as, the, adductor, muscle, of, the, bivalve, relaxes, more, stomach, is, inserted, and, when, digestion, is, complete, the, stomach, is, returned, to, its, usual, position, in, the, starfish, with, its, now, liquefied, bivalve, meal, inside, it, other, starfish, evert, the, stomach, to, feed, on, sponges, sea, anemones, corals, detritus, and, algal, films, despite, their, low, nutrition, value, and, the, abundance, of, indigestible, calcite, echinoderms, are, preyed, upon, by, many, organisms, including, bony, fish, sharks, eider, ducks, gulls, crabs, gastropod, molluscs, other, echinoderms, sea, otters, arctic, foxes, and, humans, larger, starfish, prey, on, smaller, ones, the, great, quantity, of, eggs, and, larva, that, they, produce, form, part, of, the, zooplankton, consumed, by, many, marine, creatures, crinoids, on, the, other, hand, are, relatively, free, from, predation, antipredator, defences, include, the, presence, of, spines, toxins, inherent, or, delivered, through, the, tube, feet, and, the, discharge, of, sticky, entangling, threads, by, sea, cucumbers, although, most, echinoderm, spines, are, blunt, those, of, the, crown, of, thorns, starfish, are, long, and, sharp, and, can, cause, a, painful, puncture, wound, as, the, epithelium, covering, them, contains, a, toxin, because, of, their, catch, connective, tissue, which, can, change, rapidly, from, a, flaccid, to, a, rigid, state, echinoderms, are, very, difficult, to, dislodge, from, crevices, some, sea, cucumbers, have, a, cluster, of, cuvierian, tubules, which, can, be, ejected, as, long, sticky, threads, from, their, anus, to, entangle, and, permanently, disable, an, attacker, sea, cucumbers, occasionally, defend, themselves, by, rupturing, their, body, wall, and, discharging, the, gut, and, internal, organs, starfish, and, brittle, stars, may, undergo, autotomy, when, attacked, detaching, an, arm, this, may, distract, the, predator, for, long, enough, for, the, animal, to, escape, some, starfish, species, can, swim, away, from, danger, echinoderms, are, numerous, invertebrates, whose, adults, play, an, important, role, in, benthic, ecosystems, while, the, larvae, are, a, major, component, of, the, plankton, among, the, ecological, roles, of, adults, are, the, grazing, of, sea, urchins, the, sediment, processing, of, heart, urchins, and, the, suspension, and, deposit, feeding, of, crinoids, and, sea, cucumbers, some, sea, urchins, can, bore, into, solid, rock, destabilising, rock, faces, and, releasing, nutrients, into, the, ocean, coral, reefs, are, also, bored, into, in, this, way, but, the, rate, of, accretion, of, carbonate, material, is, often, greater, than, the, erosion, produced, by, the, sea, urchin, echinoderms, sequester, about, 0, 1, gigatonnes, of, carbon, dioxide, per, year, as, calcium, carbonate, making, them, important, contributors, in, the, global, carbon, cycle, echinoderms, sometimes, have, large, population, swings, which, can, transform, ecosystems, in, 1983, for, example, the, mass, mortality, of, the, tropical, sea, urchin, diadema, antillarum, in, the, caribbean, caused, a, change, from, a, coral, dominated, reef, system, to, an, alga, dominated, one, sea, urchins, are, among, the, main, herbivores, on, reefs, and, there, is, usually, a, fine, balance, between, the, urchins, and, the, kelp, and, other, algae, on, which, they, graze, a, diminution, of, the, numbers, of, predators, otters, lobsters, and, fish, can, result, in, an, increase, in, urchin, numbers, causing, overgrazing, of, kelp, forests, resulting, in, an, alga, denuded, urchin, barren, on, the, great, barrier, reef, an, unexplained, increase, in, the, numbers, of, crown, of, thorns, starfish, acanthaster, planci, which, graze, on, living, coral, tissue, has, greatly, increased, coral, mortality, and, reduced, coral, reef, biodiversity, in, 2019, 129, 052, tonnes, of, echinoderms, were, harvested, the, majority, of, these, were, sea, cucumbers, 59, 262, tonnes, and, sea, urchins, 66, 341, tonnes, these, are, used, mainly, for, food, but, also, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, sea, cucumbers, are, considered, a, delicacy, in, some, countries, of, southeast, asia, as, such, they, are, in, imminent, danger, of, being, over, harvested, popular, species, include, the, pineapple, roller, thelenota, ananas, susuhan, and, the, red, sea, cucumber, holothuria, edulis, these, and, other, species, are, colloquially, known, as, b, che, de, mer, or, trepang, in, china, and, indonesia, the, sea, cucumbers, are, boiled, for, twenty, minutes, and, then, dried, both, naturally, and, later, over, a, fire, which, gives, them, a, smoky, tang, in, china, they, are, used, as, a, basis, for, gelatinous, soups, and, stews, both, male, and, female, gonads, of, sea, urchins, are, consumed, particularly, in, japan, and, france, the, taste, is, described, as, soft, and, melting, like, a, mixture, of, seafood, and, fruit, sea, urchin, breeding, trials, have, been, undertaken, to, try, to, compensate, for, overexploitation, because, of, their, robust, larval, growth, sea, urchins, are, widely, used, in, research, particularly, as, model, organisms, in, developmental, biology, and, ecotoxicology, strongylocentrotus, purpuratus, and, arbacia, punctulata, are, used, for, this, purpose, in, embryological, studies, the, large, size, and, the, transparency, of, the, eggs, enables, the, observation, of, sperm, cells, in, the, process, of, fertilising, ova, the, arm, regeneration, potential, of, brittle, stars, is, being, studied, in, connection, with, understanding, and, treating, neurodegenerative, diseases, in, humans, genomic, data, relevant, to, echinoderm, model, organisms, are, collected, in, echinobase, currently, there, are, 4, species, of, echinoderms, fully, supported, gene, pages, blast, jbrowse, tracks, genome, downloads, including, strongylocentrotus, purpuratus, purple, sea, urchin, lytechinus, variegatus,
