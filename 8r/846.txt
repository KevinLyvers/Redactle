humans, homo, sapiens, meaning, thinking, man, or, modern, humans, are, the, most, common, and, widespread, species, of, primate, and, the, last, surviving, species, of, the, genus, homo, they, are, great, apes, characterized, by, their, hairlessness, bipedalism, and, high, intelligence, humans, have, large, brains, enabling, more, advanced, cognitive, skills, that, enable, them, to, thrive, and, adapt, in, varied, environments, develop, highly, complex, tools, and, form, complex, social, structures, and, civilizations, humans, are, highly, social, with, individual, humans, tending, to, belong, to, a, multi, layered, network, of, cooperating, distinct, or, even, competing, social, groups, from, families, and, peer, groups, to, corporations, and, political, states, as, such, social, interactions, between, humans, have, established, a, wide, variety, of, values, social, norms, languages, and, traditions, collectively, termed, institutions, each, of, which, bolsters, human, society, humans, are, also, highly, curious, with, the, desire, to, understand, and, influence, phenomena, having, motivated, humanity, s, development, of, science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and, other, frameworks, of, knowledge, humans, also, study, themselves, through, such, domains, as, anthropology, social, science, history, psychology, and, medicine, there, are, estimated, to, be, more, than, eight, billion, humans, alive, although, some, scientists, equate, the, term, humans, with, all, members, of, the, genus, homo, in, common, usage, it, generally, refers, to, homo, sapiens, the, only, extant, member, all, other, members, of, the, genus, homo, which, are, now, extinct, are, known, as, archaic, humans, and, the, term, modern, human, is, used, to, distinguish, homo, sapiens, from, archaic, humans, anatomically, modern, humans, emerged, around, 300, 000, years, ago, in, africa, evolving, from, homo, heidelbergensis, or, a, similar, species, migrating, out, of, africa, they, gradually, replaced, and, interbred, with, local, populations, of, archaic, humans, multiple, hypotheses, for, the, extinction, of, archaic, human, species, such, as, neanderthals, include, competition, violence, interbreeding, with, homo, sapiens, or, inability, to, adapt, to, climate, change, humans, began, exhibiting, behavioral, modernity, about, 160, 000, 60, 000, years, ago, for, most, of, their, history, humans, were, nomadic, hunter, gatherers, the, neolithic, revolution, which, began, in, southwest, asia, around, 13, 000, years, ago, and, separately, in, a, few, other, places, saw, the, emergence, of, agriculture, and, permanent, human, settlement, in, turn, this, led, to, the, development, of, civilization, and, kickstarted, a, period, of, continuous, and, ongoing, population, growth, and, rapid, technological, change, since, then, a, number, of, civilizations, have, risen, and, fallen, while, a, number, of, sociocultural, and, technological, developments, have, resulted, in, significant, changes, to, the, human, lifestyle, genes, and, the, environment, influence, human, biological, variation, in, visible, characteristics, physiology, disease, susceptibility, mental, abilities, body, size, and, life, span, though, humans, vary, in, many, traits, humans, are, among, the, least, genetically, diverse, species, any, two, humans, are, at, least, 99, 5, genetically, similar, humans, are, sexually, dimorphic, generally, males, have, greater, body, strength, and, females, have, a, higher, body, fat, percentage, at, puberty, humans, develop, secondary, sex, characteristics, females, are, capable, of, pregnancy, usually, between, puberty, at, around, 12, years, old, and, menopause, around, the, age, of, 50, as, omnivorous, creatures, they, are, capable, of, consuming, a, wide, variety, of, plant, and, animal, material, and, have, used, fire, and, other, forms, of, heat, to, prepare, and, cook, food, since, the, time, of, homo, erectus, humans, can, survive, for, up, to, eight, weeks, without, food, and, several, days, without, water, humans, are, generally, diurnal, sleeping, on, average, seven, to, nine, hours, per, day, childbirth, is, dangerous, with, a, high, risk, of, complications, and, death, often, both, the, mother, and, the, father, provide, care, for, their, children, who, are, helpless, at, birth, humans, have, a, large, highly, developed, and, complex, prefrontal, cortex, the, region, of, the, brain, associated, with, higher, cognition, humans, are, highly, intelligent, and, capable, of, episodic, memory, they, have, flexible, facial, expressions, self, awareness, and, a, theory, of, mind, the, human, mind, is, capable, of, introspection, private, thought, imagination, volition, and, forming, views, on, existence, this, has, allowed, great, technological, advancements, and, complex, tool, development, through, complex, reasoning, and, the, transmission, of, knowledge, to, subsequent, generations, through, language, humans, have, had, a, dramatic, effect, on, the, environment, they, are, apex, predators, being, rarely, preyed, upon, by, other, species, human, population, growth, industrialization, land, development, overconsumption, and, combustion, of, fossil, fuels, have, led, to, environmental, destruction, and, pollution, that, significantly, contributes, to, the, ongoing, mass, extinction, of, other, forms, of, life, within, the, last, century, humans, have, explored, challenging, environments, such, as, antarctica, the, deep, sea, and, outer, space, human, habitation, within, these, hostile, environments, is, restrictive, and, expensive, typically, limited, in, duration, and, restricted, to, scientific, military, or, industrial, expeditions, humans, have, briefly, visited, the, moon, and, made, their, presence, felt, on, other, celestial, bodies, through, human, made, robotic, spacecraft, since, the, early, 20th, century, there, has, been, continuous, human, presence, in, antarctica, through, research, stations, and, since, 2000, in, space, through, habitation, on, the, international, space, station, all, modern, humans, are, classified, into, the, species, homo, sapiens, coined, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, 1735, work, systema, naturae, the, generic, name, homo, is, a, learned, 18th, century, derivation, from, latin, hom, which, refers, to, humans, of, either, sex, the, word, human, can, refer, to, all, members, of, the, homo, genus, the, name, homo, sapiens, means, wise, man, or, knowledgeable, man, there, is, disagreement, if, certain, extinct, members, of, the, genus, namely, neanderthals, should, be, included, as, a, separate, species, of, humans, or, as, a, subspecies, of, h, sapiens, human, is, a, loanword, of, middle, english, from, old, french, humain, ultimately, from, latin, h, m, nus, the, adjectival, form, of, hom, man, in, the, sense, of, humanity, the, native, english, term, man, can, refer, to, the, species, generally, a, synonym, for, humanity, as, well, as, to, human, males, it, may, also, refer, to, individuals, of, either, sex, despite, the, fact, that, the, word, animal, is, colloquially, used, as, an, antonym, for, human, and, contrary, to, a, common, biological, misconception, humans, are, animals, the, word, person, is, often, used, interchangeably, with, human, but, philosophical, debate, exists, as, to, whether, personhood, applies, to, all, humans, or, all, sentient, beings, and, further, if, a, human, can, lose, personhood, such, as, by, going, into, a, persistent, vegetative, state, humans, are, apes, superfamily, hominoidea, the, lineage, of, apes, that, eventually, gave, rise, to, humans, first, split, from, gibbons, family, hylobatidae, and, orangutans, genus, pongo, then, gorillas, genus, gorilla, and, finally, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, genus, pan, the, last, split, between, the, human, and, chimpanzee, bonobo, lineages, took, place, around, 8, 4, million, years, ago, in, the, late, miocene, epoch, during, this, split, chromosome, 2, was, formed, from, the, joining, of, two, other, chromosomes, leaving, humans, with, only, 23, pairs, of, chromosomes, compared, to, 24, for, the, other, apes, following, their, split, with, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, the, hominins, diversified, into, many, species, and, at, least, two, distinct, genera, all, but, one, of, these, lineages, representing, the, genus, homo, and, its, sole, extant, species, homo, sapiens, are, now, extinct, the, genus, homo, evolved, from, australopithecus, though, fossils, from, the, transition, are, scarce, the, earliest, members, of, homo, share, several, key, traits, with, australopithecus, the, earliest, record, of, homo, is, the, 2, 8, million, year, old, specimen, ld, 350, 1, from, ethiopia, and, the, earliest, named, species, are, homo, habilis, and, homo, rudolfensis, which, evolved, by, 2, 3, million, years, ago, h, erectus, the, african, variant, is, sometimes, called, h, ergaster, evolved, 2, million, years, ago, and, was, the, first, archaic, human, species, to, leave, africa, and, disperse, across, eurasia, h, erectus, also, was, the, first, to, evolve, a, characteristically, human, body, plan, homo, sapiens, emerged, in, africa, around, 300, 000, years, ago, from, a, species, commonly, designated, as, either, h, heidelbergensis, or, h, rhodesiensis, the, descendants, of, h, erectus, that, remained, in, africa, h, sapiens, migrated, out, of, the, continent, gradually, replacing, or, interbreeding, with, local, populations, of, archaic, humans, humans, began, exhibiting, behavioral, modernity, about, 160, 000, 70, 000, years, ago, and, possibly, earlier, this, development, was, likely, selected, amidst, natural, climate, change, in, middle, to, late, pleistocene, africa, the, out, of, africa, migration, took, place, in, at, least, two, waves, the, first, around, 130, 000, to, 100, 000, years, ago, the, second, southern, dispersal, around, 70, 000, to, 50, 000, years, ago, h, sapiens, proceeded, to, colonize, all, the, continents, and, larger, islands, arriving, in, eurasia, 125, 000, years, ago, australia, around, 65, 000, years, ago, the, americas, around, 15, 000, years, ago, and, remote, islands, such, as, hawaii, easter, island, madagascar, and, new, zealand, in, the, years, 300, to, 1280, ce, human, evolution, was, not, a, simple, linear, or, branched, progression, but, involved, interbreeding, between, related, species, genomic, research, has, shown, that, hybridization, between, substantially, diverged, lineages, was, common, in, human, evolution, dna, evidence, suggests, that, several, genes, of, neanderthal, origin, are, present, among, all, non, sub, saharan, african, populations, and, neanderthals, and, other, hominins, such, as, denisovans, may, have, contributed, up, to, 6, of, their, genome, to, present, day, non, sub, saharan, african, humans, human, evolution, is, characterized, by, a, number, of, morphological, developmental, physiological, and, behavioral, changes, that, have, taken, place, since, the, split, between, the, last, common, ancestor, of, humans, and, chimpanzees, the, most, significant, of, these, adaptations, are, hairlessness, obligate, bipedalism, increased, brain, size, and, decreased, sexual, dimorphism, neoteny, the, relationship, between, all, these, changes, is, the, subject, of, ongoing, debate, hylobatidae, gibbons, pongo, abelii, pongo, tapanuliensis, pongo, pygmaeus, gorilla, gorilla, gorilla, beringei, pan, troglodytes, pan, paniscus, homo, sapiens, humans, until, about, 12, 000, years, ago, all, humans, lived, as, hunter, gatherers, the, neolithic, revolution, the, invention, of, agriculture, first, took, place, in, southwest, asia, and, spread, through, large, parts, of, the, old, world, over, the, following, millennia, it, also, occurred, independently, in, mesoamerica, about, 6, 000, years, ago, china, papua, new, guinea, and, the, sahel, and, west, savanna, regions, of, africa, access, to, food, surplus, led, to, the, formation, of, permanent, human, settlements, the, domestication, of, animals, and, the, use, of, metal, tools, for, the, first, time, in, history, agriculture, and, sedentary, lifestyle, led, to, the, emergence, of, early, civilizations, an, urban, revolution, took, place, in, the, 4th, millennium, bce, with, the, development, of, city, states, particularly, sumerian, cities, located, in, mesopotamia, it, was, in, these, cities, that, the, earliest, known, form, of, writing, cuneiform, script, appeared, around, 3000, bce, other, major, civilizations, to, develop, around, this, time, were, ancient, egypt, and, the, indus, valley, civilisation, they, eventually, traded, with, each, other, and, invented, technology, such, as, wheels, plows, and, sails, emerging, by, 3000, bce, the, caral, supe, civilization, is, the, oldest, complex, civilization, in, the, americas, astronomy, and, mathematics, were, also, developed, and, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, was, built, there, is, evidence, of, a, severe, drought, lasting, about, a, hundred, years, that, may, have, caused, the, decline, of, these, civilizations, with, new, ones, appearing, in, the, aftermath, babylonians, came, to, dominate, mesopotamia, while, others, such, as, the, poverty, point, culture, minoans, and, the, shang, dynasty, rose, to, prominence, in, new, areas, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, around, 1200, bce, resulted, in, the, disappearance, of, a, number, of, civilizations, and, the, beginning, of, the, greek, dark, ages, during, this, period, iron, started, replacing, bronze, leading, to, the, iron, age, in, the, 5th, century, bce, history, started, being, recorded, as, a, discipline, which, provided, a, much, clearer, picture, of, life, at, the, time, between, the, 8th, and, 6th, century, bce, europe, entered, the, classical, antiquity, age, a, period, when, ancient, greece, and, ancient, rome, flourished, around, this, time, other, civilizations, also, came, to, prominence, the, maya, civilization, started, to, build, cities, and, create, complex, calendars, in, africa, the, kingdom, of, aksum, overtook, the, declining, kingdom, of, kush, and, facilitated, trade, between, india, and, the, mediterranean, in, west, asia, the, achaemenid, empire, s, system, of, centralized, governance, became, the, precursor, to, many, later, empires, while, the, gupta, empire, in, india, and, the, han, dynasty, in, china, have, been, described, as, golden, ages, in, their, respective, regions, following, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, in, 476, europe, entered, the, middle, ages, during, this, period, christianity, and, the, church, would, provide, centralized, authority, and, education, in, the, middle, east, islam, became, the, prominent, religion, and, expanded, into, north, africa, it, led, to, an, islamic, golden, age, inspiring, achievements, in, architecture, the, revival, of, old, advances, in, science, and, technology, and, the, formation, of, a, distinct, way, of, life, the, christian, and, islamic, worlds, would, eventually, clash, with, the, kingdom, of, england, the, kingdom, of, france, and, the, holy, roman, empire, declaring, a, series, of, holy, wars, to, regain, control, of, the, holy, land, from, muslims, in, the, americas, between, 200, and, 900, ce, mesoamerica, was, in, its, classic, period, while, further, north, complex, mississippian, societies, would, arise, starting, around, 800, ce, the, mongol, empire, would, conquer, much, of, eurasia, in, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, over, this, same, time, period, the, mali, empire, in, africa, grew, to, be, the, largest, empire, on, the, continent, stretching, from, senegambia, to, ivory, coast, oceania, would, see, the, rise, of, the, tu, i, tonga, empire, which, expanded, across, many, islands, in, the, south, pacific, by, the, late, 15th, century, the, aztecs, and, inca, had, become, the, dominant, power, in, mesoamerica, and, the, andes, respectively, the, early, modern, period, in, europe, and, the, near, east, c, 1450, 1800, began, with, the, final, defeat, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, rise, of, the, ottoman, empire, meanwhile, japan, entered, the, edo, period, the, qing, dynasty, rose, in, china, and, the, mughal, empire, ruled, much, of, india, europe, underwent, the, renaissance, starting, in, the, 15th, century, and, the, age, of, discovery, began, with, the, exploring, and, colonizing, of, new, regions, this, included, the, colonization, of, the, americas, and, the, columbian, exchange, this, expansion, led, to, the, atlantic, slave, trade, and, the, genocide, of, native, american, peoples, this, period, also, marked, the, scientific, revolution, with, great, advances, in, mathematics, mechanics, astronomy, and, physiology, the, late, modern, period, 1800, present, saw, the, technological, and, industrial, revolution, bring, such, discoveries, as, imaging, technology, major, innovations, in, transport, and, energy, development, influenced, by, enlightenment, ideals, the, americas, and, europe, experienced, a, period, of, political, revolutions, known, as, the, age, of, revolution, the, napoleonic, wars, raged, through, europe, in, the, early, 1800s, spain, lost, most, of, its, colonies, in, the, new, world, while, europeans, continued, expansion, into, africa, where, european, control, went, from, 10, to, almost, 90, in, less, than, 50, years, and, oceania, in, the, 19th, century, the, british, empire, expanded, to, become, the, world, s, largest, empire, a, tenuous, balance, of, power, among, european, nations, collapsed, in, 1914, with, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, one, of, the, deadliest, conflicts, in, history, in, the, 1930s, a, worldwide, economic, crisis, led, to, the, rise, of, authoritarian, regimes, and, a, second, world, war, involving, almost, all, of, the, world, s, countries, the, war, s, destruction, led, to, the, collapse, of, most, global, empires, leading, to, widespread, decolonization, following, the, conclusion, of, the, second, world, war, in, 1945, the, united, states, and, the, ussr, emerged, as, the, remaining, global, superpowers, this, led, to, a, cold, war, that, saw, a, struggle, for, global, influence, including, a, nuclear, arms, race, and, a, space, race, ending, in, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, the, current, information, age, spurred, by, the, development, of, the, internet, and, artificial, intelligence, systems, sees, the, world, becoming, increasingly, globalized, and, interconnected, early, human, settlements, were, dependent, on, proximity, to, water, and, depending, on, the, lifestyle, other, natural, resources, used, for, subsistence, such, as, populations, of, animal, prey, for, hunting, and, arable, land, for, growing, crops, and, grazing, livestock, modern, humans, however, have, a, great, capacity, for, altering, their, habitats, by, means, of, technology, irrigation, urban, planning, construction, deforestation, and, desertification, human, settlements, continue, to, be, vulnerable, to, natural, disasters, especially, those, placed, in, hazardous, locations, and, with, low, quality, of, construction, grouping, and, deliberate, habitat, alteration, is, often, done, with, the, goals, of, providing, protection, accumulating, comforts, or, material, wealth, expanding, the, available, food, improving, aesthetics, increasing, knowledge, or, enhancing, the, exchange, of, resources, humans, are, one, of, the, most, adaptable, species, despite, having, a, low, or, narrow, tolerance, for, many, of, the, earth, s, extreme, environments, currently, the, species, is, present, in, all, eight, biogeographical, realms, although, their, presence, in, the, antarctic, realm, is, very, limited, to, research, stations, and, annually, there, is, a, population, decline, in, the, winter, months, of, this, realm, humans, established, nation, states, in, the, other, seven, realms, such, as, south, africa, india, russia, australia, fiji, united, states, and, brazil, each, located, in, a, different, biogeographical, realm, by, using, advanced, tools, and, clothing, humans, have, been, able, to, extend, their, tolerance, to, a, wide, variety, of, temperatures, humidities, and, altitudes, as, a, result, humans, are, a, cosmopolitan, species, found, in, almost, all, regions, of, the, world, including, tropical, rainforest, arid, desert, extremely, cold, arctic, regions, and, heavily, polluted, cities, in, comparison, most, other, species, are, confined, to, a, few, geographical, areas, by, their, limited, adaptability, the, human, population, is, not, however, uniformly, distributed, on, the, earth, s, surface, because, the, population, density, varies, from, one, region, to, another, and, large, stretches, of, surface, are, almost, completely, uninhabited, like, antarctica, and, vast, swathes, of, the, ocean, most, humans, 61, live, in, asia, the, remainder, live, in, the, americas, 14, africa, 14, europe, 11, and, oceania, 0, 5, estimates, of, the, population, at, the, time, agriculture, emerged, in, around, 10, 000, bc, have, ranged, between, 1, million, and, 15, million, around, 50, 60, million, people, lived, in, the, combined, eastern, and, western, roman, empire, in, the, 4th, century, ad, bubonic, plagues, first, recorded, in, the, 6th, century, ad, reduced, the, population, by, 50, with, the, black, death, killing, 75, 200, million, people, in, eurasia, and, north, africa, alone, human, population, is, believed, to, have, reached, one, billion, in, 1800, it, has, since, then, increased, exponentially, reaching, two, billion, in, 1930, and, three, billion, in, 1960, four, in, 1975, five, in, 1987, and, six, billion, in, 1999, it, passed, seven, billion, in, 2011, and, passed, eight, billion, in, november, 2022, it, took, over, two, million, years, of, human, prehistory, and, history, for, the, human, population, to, reach, one, billion, and, only, 207, years, more, to, grow, to, 7, billion, the, combined, biomass, of, the, carbon, of, all, the, humans, on, earth, in, 2018, was, estimated, at, 60, million, tons, about, 10, times, larger, than, that, of, all, non, domesticated, mammals, in, 2018, 4, 2, billion, humans, 55, lived, in, urban, areas, up, from, 751, million, in, 1950, the, most, urbanized, regions, are, northern, america, 82, latin, america, 81, europe, 74, and, oceania, 68, with, africa, and, asia, having, nearly, 90, of, the, world, s, 3, 4, billion, rural, population, problems, for, humans, living, in, cities, include, various, forms, of, pollution, and, crime, especially, in, inner, city, and, suburban, slums, most, aspects, of, human, physiology, are, closely, homologous, to, corresponding, aspects, of, animal, physiology, the, dental, formula, of, humans, is, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, humans, have, proportionately, shorter, palates, and, much, smaller, teeth, than, other, primates, they, are, the, only, primates, to, have, short, relatively, flush, canine, teeth, humans, have, characteristically, crowded, teeth, with, gaps, from, lost, teeth, usually, closing, up, quickly, in, young, individuals, humans, are, gradually, losing, their, third, molars, with, some, individuals, having, them, congenitally, absent, humans, share, with, chimpanzees, a, vestigial, tail, appendix, flexible, shoulder, joints, grasping, fingers, and, opposable, thumbs, humans, also, have, a, more, barrel, shaped, chests, in, contrast, to, the, funnel, shape, of, other, apes, an, adaptation, for, bipedal, respiration, apart, from, bipedalism, and, brain, size, humans, differ, from, chimpanzees, mostly, in, smelling, hearing, and, digesting, proteins, while, humans, have, a, density, of, hair, follicles, comparable, to, other, apes, it, is, predominantly, vellus, hair, most, of, which, is, so, short, and, wispy, as, to, be, practically, invisible, humans, have, about, 2, million, sweat, glands, spread, over, their, entire, bodies, many, more, than, chimpanzees, whose, sweat, glands, are, scarce, and, are, mainly, located, on, the, palm, of, the, hand, and, on, the, soles, of, the, feet, it, is, estimated, that, the, worldwide, average, height, for, an, adult, human, male, is, about, 171, cm, 5, ft, 7, in, while, the, worldwide, average, height, for, adult, human, females, is, about, 159, cm, 5, ft, 3, in, shrinkage, of, stature, may, begin, in, middle, age, in, some, individuals, but, tends, to, be, typical, in, the, extremely, aged, throughout, history, human, populations, have, universally, become, taller, probably, as, a, consequence, of, better, nutrition, healthcare, and, living, conditions, the, average, mass, of, an, adult, human, is, 59, kg, 130, lb, for, females, and, 77, kg, 170, lb, for, males, like, many, other, conditions, body, weight, and, body, type, are, influenced, by, both, genetic, susceptibility, and, environment, and, varies, greatly, among, individuals, humans, have, a, far, faster, and, more, accurate, throw, than, other, animals, humans, are, also, among, the, best, long, distance, runners, in, the, animal, kingdom, but, slower, over, short, distances, humans, thinner, body, hair, and, more, productive, sweat, glands, help, avoid, heat, exhaustion, while, running, for, long, distances, compared, to, other, apes, the, human, heart, produces, greater, stroke, volume, and, cardiac, output, and, the, aorta, is, proportionately, larger, like, most, animals, humans, are, a, diploid, and, eukaryotic, species, each, somatic, cell, has, two, sets, of, 23, chromosomes, each, set, received, from, one, parent, gametes, have, only, one, set, of, chromosomes, which, is, a, mixture, of, the, two, parental, sets, among, the, 23, pairs, of, chromosomes, there, are, 22, pairs, of, autosomes, and, one, pair, of, sex, chromosomes, like, other, mammals, humans, have, an, xy, sex, determination, system, so, that, females, have, the, sex, chromosomes, xx, and, males, have, xy, genes, and, environment, influence, human, biological, variation, in, visible, characteristics, physiology, disease, susceptibility, and, mental, abilities, the, exact, influence, of, genes, and, environment, on, certain, traits, is, not, well, understood, while, no, humans, not, even, monozygotic, twins, are, genetically, identical, two, humans, on, average, will, have, a, genetic, similarity, of, 99, 5, 99, 9, this, makes, them, more, homogeneous, than, other, great, apes, including, chimpanzees, this, small, variation, in, human, dna, compared, to, many, other, species, suggests, a, population, bottleneck, during, the, late, pleistocene, around, 100, 000, years, ago, in, which, the, human, population, was, reduced, to, a, small, number, of, breeding, pairs, the, forces, of, natural, selection, have, continued, to, operate, on, human, populations, with, evidence, that, certain, regions, of, the, genome, display, directional, selection, in, the, past, 15, 000, years, the, human, genome, was, first, sequenced, in, 2001, and, by, 2020, hundreds, of, thousands, of, genomes, had, been, sequenced, in, 2012, the, international, hapmap, project, had, compared, the, genomes, of, 1, 184, individuals, from, 11, populations, and, identified, 1, 6, million, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, african, populations, harbor, the, highest, number, of, private, genetic, variants, while, many, of, the, common, variants, found, in, populations, outside, of, africa, are, also, found, on, the, african, continent, there, are, still, large, numbers, that, are, private, to, these, regions, especially, oceania, and, the, americas, by, 2010, estimates, humans, have, approximately, 22, 000, genes, by, comparing, mitochondrial, dna, which, is, inherited, only, from, the, mother, geneticists, have, concluded, that, the, last, female, common, ancestor, whose, genetic, marker, is, found, in, all, modern, humans, the, so, called, mitochondrial, eve, must, have, lived, around, 90, 000, to, 200, 000, years, ago, most, human, reproduction, takes, place, by, internal, fertilization, via, sexual, intercourse, but, can, also, occur, through, assisted, reproductive, technology, procedures, the, average, gestation, period, is, 38, weeks, but, a, normal, pregnancy, can, vary, by, up, to, 37, days, embryonic, development, in, the, human, covers, the, first, eight, weeks, of, development, at, the, beginning, of, the, ninth, week, the, embryo, is, termed, a, fetus, humans, are, able, to, induce, early, labor, or, perform, a, caesarean, section, if, the, child, needs, to, be, born, earlier, for, medical, reasons, in, developed, countries, infants, are, typically, 3, 4, kg, 7, 9, lb, in, weight, and, 47, 53, cm, 19, 21, in, in, height, at, birth, however, low, birth, weight, is, common, in, developing, countries, and, contributes, to, the, high, levels, of, infant, mortality, in, these, regions, compared, with, other, species, human, childbirth, is, dangerous, with, a, much, higher, risk, of, complications, and, death, the, size, of, the, fetus, s, head, is, more, closely, matched, to, the, pelvis, than, in, other, primates, the, reason, for, this, is, not, completely, understood, but, it, contributes, to, a, painful, labor, that, can, last, 24, hours, or, more, the, chances, of, a, successful, labor, increased, significantly, during, the, 20th, century, in, wealthier, countries, with, the, advent, of, new, medical, technologies, in, contrast, pregnancy, and, natural, childbirth, remain, hazardous, ordeals, in, developing, regions, of, the, world, with, maternal, death, rates, approximately, 100, times, greater, than, in, developed, countries, both, the, mother, and, the, father, provide, care, for, human, offspring, in, contrast, to, other, primates, where, parental, care, is, mostly, done, by, the, mother, helpless, at, birth, humans, continue, to, grow, for, some, years, typically, reaching, sexual, maturity, at, 15, to, 17, years, of, age, the, human, life, span, has, been, split, into, various, stages, ranging, from, three, to, twelve, common, stages, include, infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and, old, age, the, lengths, of, these, stages, have, varied, across, cultures, and, time, periods, but, is, typified, by, an, unusually, rapid, growth, spurt, during, adolescence, human, females, undergo, menopause, and, become, infertile, at, around, the, age, of, 50, it, has, been, proposed, that, menopause, increases, a, woman, s, overall, reproductive, success, by, allowing, her, to, invest, more, time, and, resources, in, her, existing, offspring, and, in, turn, their, children, the, grandmother, hypothesis, rather, than, by, continuing, to, bear, children, into, old, age, the, life, span, of, an, individual, depends, on, two, major, factors, genetics, and, lifestyle, choices, for, various, reasons, including, biological, genetic, causes, women, live, on, average, about, four, years, longer, than, men, as, of, 2018, the, global, average, life, expectancy, at, birth, of, a, girl, is, estimated, to, be, 74, 9, years, compared, to, 70, 4, for, a, boy, there, are, significant, geographical, variations, in, human, life, expectancy, mostly, correlated, with, economic, development, for, example, life, expectancy, at, birth, in, hong, kong, is, 87, 6, years, for, girls, and, 81, 8, for, boys, while, in, the, central, african, republic, it, is, 55, 0, years, for, girls, and, 50, 6, for, boys, the, developed, world, is, generally, aging, with, the, median, age, around, 40, years, in, the, developing, world, the, median, age, is, between, 15, and, 20, years, while, one, in, five, europeans, is, 60, years, of, age, or, older, only, one, in, twenty, africans, is, 60, years, of, age, or, older, in, 2012, the, united, nations, estimated, that, there, were, 316, 600, living, centenarians, humans, of, age, 100, or, older, worldwide, humans, are, omnivorous, capable, of, consuming, a, wide, variety, of, plant, and, animal, material, human, groups, have, adopted, a, range, of, diets, from, purely, vegan, to, primarily, carnivorous, in, some, cases, dietary, restrictions, in, humans, can, lead, to, deficiency, diseases, however, stable, human, groups, have, adapted, to, many, dietary, patterns, through, both, genetic, specialization, and, cultural, conventions, to, use, nutritionally, balanced, food, sources, the, human, diet, is, prominently, reflected, in, human, culture, and, has, led, to, the, development, of, food, science, until, the, development, of, agriculture, homo, sapiens, employed, a, hunter, gatherer, method, as, their, sole, means, of, food, collection, this, involved, combining, stationary, food, sources, such, as, fruits, grains, tubers, and, mushrooms, insect, larvae, and, aquatic, mollusks, with, wild, game, which, must, be, hunted, and, captured, in, order, to, be, consumed, it, has, been, proposed, that, humans, have, used, fire, to, prepare, and, cook, food, since, the, time, of, homo, erectus, human, domestication, of, wild, plants, began, about, 11, 700, years, ago, leading, to, the, development, of, agriculture, a, gradual, process, called, the, neolithic, revolution, these, dietary, changes, may, also, have, altered, human, biology, the, spread, of, dairy, farming, provided, a, new, and, rich, source, of, food, leading, to, the, evolution, of, the, ability, to, digest, lactose, in, some, adults, the, types, of, food, consumed, and, how, they, are, prepared, have, varied, widely, by, time, location, and, culture, in, general, humans, can, survive, for, up, to, eight, weeks, without, food, depending, on, stored, body, fat, survival, without, water, is, usually, limited, to, three, or, four, days, with, a, maximum, of, one, week, in, 2020, it, is, estimated, 9, million, humans, die, every, year, from, causes, directly, or, indirectly, related, to, starvation, childhood, malnutrition, is, also, common, and, contributes, to, the, global, burden, of, disease, however, global, food, distribution, is, not, even, and, obesity, among, some, human, populations, has, increased, rapidly, leading, to, health, complications, and, increased, mortality, in, some, developed, and, a, few, developing, countries, worldwide, over, one, billion, people, are, obese, while, in, the, united, states, 35, of, people, are, obese, leading, to, this, being, described, as, an, obesity, epidemic, obesity, is, caused, by, consuming, more, calories, than, are, expended, so, excessive, weight, gain, is, usually, caused, by, an, energy, dense, diet, there, is, biological, variation, in, the, human, species, with, traits, such, as, blood, type, genetic, diseases, cranial, features, facial, features, organ, systems, eye, color, hair, color, and, texture, height, and, build, and, skin, color, varying, across, the, globe, the, typical, height, of, an, adult, human, is, between, 1, 4, and, 1, 9, m, 4, ft, 7, in, and, 6, ft, 3, in, although, this, varies, significantly, depending, on, sex, ethnic, origin, and, family, bloodlines, body, size, is, partly, determined, by, genes, and, is, also, significantly, influenced, by, environmental, factors, such, as, diet, exercise, and, sleep, patterns, there, is, evidence, that, populations, have, adapted, genetically, to, various, external, factors, the, genes, that, allow, adult, humans, to, digest, lactose, are, present, in, high, frequencies, in, populations, that, have, long, histories, of, cattle, domestication, and, are, more, dependent, on, cow, milk, sickle, cell, anemia, which, may, provide, increased, resistance, to, malaria, is, frequent, in, populations, where, malaria, is, endemic, populations, that, have, for, a, very, long, time, inhabited, specific, climates, tend, to, have, developed, specific, phenotypes, that, are, beneficial, for, those, environments, short, stature, and, stocky, build, in, cold, regions, tall, and, lanky, in, hot, regions, and, with, high, lung, capacities, or, other, adaptations, at, high, altitudes, some, populations, have, evolved, highly, unique, adaptations, to, very, specific, environmental, conditions, such, as, those, advantageous, to, ocean, dwelling, lifestyles, and, freediving, in, the, bajau, human, hair, ranges, in, color, from, red, to, blond, to, brown, to, black, which, is, the, most, frequent, hair, color, depends, on, the, amount, of, melanin, with, concentrations, fading, with, increased, age, leading, to, grey, or, even, white, hair, skin, color, can, range, from, darkest, brown, to, lightest, peach, or, even, nearly, white, or, colorless, in, cases, of, albinism, it, tends, to, vary, clinally, and, generally, correlates, with, the, level, of, ultraviolet, radiation, in, a, particular, geographic, area, with, darker, skin, mostly, around, the, equator, skin, darkening, may, have, evolved, as, protection, against, ultraviolet, solar, radiation, light, skin, pigmentation, protects, against, depletion, of, vitamin, d, which, requires, sunlight, to, make, human, skin, also, has, a, capacity, to, darken, tan, in, response, to, exposure, to, ultraviolet, radiation, there, is, relatively, little, variation, between, human, geographical, populations, and, most, of, the, variation, that, occurs, is, at, the, individual, level, much, of, human, variation, is, continuous, often, with, no, clear, points, of, demarcation, genetic, data, shows, that, no, matter, how, population, groups, are, defined, two, people, from, the, same, population, group, are, almost, as, different, from, each, other, as, two, people, from, any, two, different, population, groups, dark, skinned, populations, that, are, found, in, africa, australia, and, south, asia, are, not, closely, related, to, each, other, genetic, research, has, demonstrated, that, human, populations, native, to, the, african, continent, are, the, most, genetically, diverse, and, genetic, diversity, decreases, with, migratory, distance, from, africa, possibly, the, result, of, bottlenecks, during, human, migration, these, non, african, populations, acquired, new, genetic, inputs, from, local, admixture, with, archaic, populations, and, have, much, greater, variation, from, neanderthals, and, denisovans, than, is, found, in, africa, though, neanderthal, admixture, into, african, populations, may, be, underestimated, furthermore, recent, studies, have, found, that, populations, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, particularly, west, africa, have, ancestral, genetic, variation, which, predates, modern, humans, and, has, been, lost, in, most, non, african, populations, some, of, this, ancestry, is, thought, to, originate, from, admixture, with, an, unknown, archaic, hominin, that, diverged, before, the, split, of, neanderthals, and, modern, humans, humans, are, a, gonochoric, species, meaning, they, are, divided, into, male, and, female, sexes, the, greatest, degree, of, genetic, variation, exists, between, males, and, females, while, the, nucleotide, genetic, variation, of, individuals, of, the, same, sex, across, global, populations, is, no, greater, than, 0, 1, 0, 5, the, genetic, difference, between, males, and, females, is, between, 1, and, 2, males, on, average, are, 15, heavier, and, 15, cm, 6, in, taller, than, females, on, average, men, have, about, 40, 50, more, upper, body, strength, and, 20, 30, more, lower, body, strength, than, women, at, the, same, weight, due, to, higher, amounts, of, muscle, and, larger, muscle, fibers, women, generally, have, a, higher, body, fat, percentage, than, men, women, have, lighter, skin, than, men, of, the, same, population, this, has, been, explained, by, a, higher, need, for, vitamin, d, in, females, during, pregnancy, and, lactation, as, there, are, chromosomal, differences, between, females, and, males, some, x, and, y, chromosome, related, conditions, and, disorders, only, affect, either, men, or, women, after, allowing, for, body, weight, and, volume, the, male, voice, is, usually, an, octave, deeper, than, the, female, voice, women, have, a, longer, life, span, in, almost, every, population, around, the, world, there, are, intersex, conditions, in, the, human, population, however, these, are, rare, the, human, brain, the, focal, point, of, the, central, nervous, system, in, humans, controls, the, peripheral, nervous, system, in, addition, to, controlling, lower, involuntary, or, primarily, autonomic, activities, such, as, respiration, and, digestion, it, is, also, the, locus, of, higher, order, functioning, such, as, thought, reasoning, and, abstraction, these, cognitive, processes, constitute, the, mind, and, along, with, their, behavioral, consequences, are, studied, in, the, field, of, psychology, humans, have, a, larger, and, more, developed, prefrontal, cortex, than, other, primates, the, region, of, the, brain, associated, with, higher, cognition, this, has, led, humans, to, proclaim, themselves, to, be, more, intelligent, than, any, other, known, species, objectively, defining, intelligence, is, difficult, with, other, animals, adapting, senses, and, excelling, in, areas, that, humans, are, unable, to, there, are, some, traits, that, although, not, strictly, unique, do, set, humans, apart, from, other, animals, humans, may, be, the, only, animals, who, have, episodic, memory, and, who, can, engage, in, mental, time, travel, even, compared, with, other, social, animals, humans, have, an, unusually, high, degree, of, flexibility, in, their, facial, expressions, humans, are, the, only, animals, known, to, cry, emotional, tears, humans, are, one, of, the, few, animals, able, to, self, recognize, in, mirror, tests, and, there, is, also, debate, over, to, what, extent, humans, are, the, only, animals, with, a, theory, of, mind, humans, are, generally, diurnal, the, average, sleep, requirement, is, between, seven, and, nine, hours, per, day, for, an, adult, and, nine, to, ten, hours, per, day, for, a, child, elderly, people, usually, sleep, for, six, to, seven, hours, having, less, sleep, than, this, is, common, among, humans, even, though, sleep, deprivation, can, have, negative, health, effects, a, sustained, restriction, of, adult, sleep, to, four, hours, per, day, has, been, shown, to, correlate, with, changes, in, physiology, and, mental, state, including, reduced, memory, fatigue, aggression, and, bodily, discomfort, during, sleep, humans, dream, where, they, experience, sensory, images, and, sounds, dreaming, is, stimulated, by, the, pons, and, mostly, occurs, during, the, rem, phase, of, sleep, the, length, of, a, dream, can, vary, from, a, few, seconds, up, to, 30, minutes, humans, have, three, to, five, dreams, per, night, and, some, may, have, up, to, seven, dreamers, are, more, likely, to, remember, the, dream, if, awakened, during, the, rem, phase, the, events, in, dreams, are, generally, outside, the, control, of, the, dreamer, with, the, exception, of, lucid, dreaming, where, the, dreamer, is, self, aware, dreams, can, at, times, make, a, creative, thought, occur, or, give, a, sense, of, inspiration, human, consciousness, at, its, simplest, is, sentience, or, awareness, of, internal, or, external, existence, despite, centuries, of, analyses, definitions, explanations, and, debates, by, philosophers, and, scientists, consciousness, remains, puzzling, and, controversial, being, at, once, the, most, familiar, and, most, mysterious, aspect, of, our, lives, the, only, widely, agreed, notion, about, the, topic, is, the, intuition, that, it, exists, opinions, differ, about, what, exactly, needs, to, be, studied, and, explained, as, consciousness, some, philosophers, divide, consciousness, into, phenomenal, consciousness, which, is, sensory, experience, itself, and, access, consciousness, which, can, be, used, for, reasoning, or, directly, controlling, actions, it, is, sometimes, synonymous, with, the, mind, and, at, other, times, an, aspect, of, it, historically, it, is, associated, with, introspection, private, thought, imagination, and, volition, it, now, often, includes, some, kind, of, experience, cognition, feeling, or, perception, it, may, be, awareness, or, awareness, of, awareness, or, self, awareness, there, might, be, different, levels, or, orders, of, consciousness, or, different, kinds, of, consciousness, or, just, one, kind, with, different, features, the, process, of, acquiring, knowledge, and, understanding, through, thought, experience, and, the, senses, is, known, as, cognition, the, human, brain, perceives, the, external, world, through, the, senses, and, each, individual, human, is, influenced, greatly, by, his, or, her, experiences, leading, to, subjective, views, of, existence, and, the, passage, of, time, the, nature, of, thought, is, central, to, psychology, and, related, fields, cognitive, psychology, studies, cognition, the, mental, processes, underlying, behavior, largely, focusing, on, the, development, of, the, human, mind, through, the, life, span, developmental, psychology, seeks, to, understand, how, people, come, to, perceive, understand, and, act, within, the, world, and, how, these, processes, change, as, they, age, this, may, focus, on, intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or, moral, development, psychologists, have, developed, intelligence, tests, and, the, concept, of, intelligence, quotient, in, order, to, assess, the, relative, intelligence, of, human, beings, and, study, its, distribution, among, population, human, motivation, is, not, yet, wholly, understood, from, a, psychological, perspective, maslow, s, hierarchy, of, needs, is, a, well, established, theory, that, can, be, defined, as, the, process, of, satisfying, certain, needs, in, ascending, order, of, complexity, from, a, more, general, philosophical, perspective, human, motivation, can, be, defined, as, a, commitment, to, or, withdrawal, from, various, goals, requiring, the, application, of, human, ability, furthermore, incentive, and, preference, are, both, factors, as, are, any, perceived, links, between, incentives, and, preferences, volition, may, also, be, involved, in, which, case,

neurophysiological, changes, variously, associated, with, thoughts, feelings, behavioral, responses, and, a, degree, of, pleasure, or, displeasure, they, are, often, intertwined, with, mood, temperament, personality, disposition, creativity, and, motivation, emotion, has, a, significant, influence, on, human, behavior, and, their, ability, to, learn, acting, on, extreme, or, uncontrolled, emotions, can, lead, to, social, disorder, and, crime, with, studies, showing, criminals, may, have, a, lower, emotional, intelligence, than, normal, emotional, experiences, perceived, as, pleasant, such, as, joy, interest, or, contentment, contrast, with, those, perceived, as, unpleasant, like, anxiety, sadness, anger, and, despair, happiness, or, the, state, of, being, happy, is, a, human, emotional, condition, the, definition, of, happiness, is, a, common, philosophical, topic, some, define, it, as, experiencing, the, feeling, of, positive, emotional, affects, while, avoiding, the, negative, ones, others, see, it, as, an, appraisal, of, life, satisfaction, or, quality, of, life, recent, research, suggests, that, being, happy, might, involve, experiencing, some, negative, emotions, when, humans, feel, they, are, warranted, for, humans, sexuality, involves, biological, erotic, physical, emotional, social, or, spiritual, feelings, and, behaviors, because, it, is, a, broad, term, which, has, varied, with, historical, contexts, over, time, it, lacks, a, precise, definition, the, biological, and, physical, aspects, of, sexuality, largely, concern, the, human, reproductive, functions, including, the, human, sexual, response, cycle, sexuality, also, affects, and, is, affected, by, cultural, political, legal, philosophical, moral, ethical, and, religious, aspects, of, life, sexual, desire, or, libido, is, a, basic, mental, state, present, at, the, beginning, of, sexual, behavior, studies, show, that, men, desire, sex, more, than, women, and, masturbate, more, often, humans, can, fall, anywhere, along, a, continuous, scale, of, sexual, orientation, although, most, humans, are, heterosexual, while, homosexual, behavior, occurs, in, some, other, animals, only, humans, and, domestic, sheep, have, so, far, been, found, to, exhibit, exclusive, preference, for, same, sex, relationships, most, evidence, supports, nonsocial, biological, causes, of, sexual, orientation, as, cultures, that, are, very, tolerant, of, homosexuality, do, not, have, significantly, higher, rates, of, it, research, in, neuroscience, and, genetics, suggests, that, other, aspects, of, human, sexuality, are, biologically, influenced, as, well, love, most, commonly, refers, to, a, feeling, of, strong, attraction, or, emotional, attachment, it, can, be, impersonal, the, love, of, an, object, ideal, or, strong, political, or, spiritual, connection, or, interpersonal, love, between, humans, when, in, love, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and, other, chemicals, stimulate, the, brain, s, pleasure, center, leading, to, side, effects, such, as, increased, heart, rate, loss, of, appetite, and, sleep, and, an, intense, feeling, of, excitement, humanity, s, unprecedented, set, of, intellectual, skills, were, a, key, factor, in, the, species, eventual, technological, advancement, and, concomitant, domination, of, the, biosphere, disregarding,

traits, and, behaviors, that, are, mostly, unique, to, humans, include, starting, fires, phoneme, structuring, and, vocal, learning, while, many, species, communicate, language, is, unique, to, humans, a, defining, feature, of, humanity, and, a, cultural, universal, unlike, the, limited, systems, of, other, animals, human, language, is, open, an, infinite, number, of, meanings, can, be, produced, by, combining, a, limited, number, of, symbols, human, language, also, has, the, capacity, of, displacement, using, words, to, represent, things, and, happenings, that, are, not, presently, or, locally, occurring, but, reside, in, the, shared, imagination, of, interlocutors, language, differs, from, other, forms, of, communication, in, that, it, is, modality, independent, the, same, meanings, can, be, conveyed, through, different, media, audibly, in, speech, visually, by, sign, language, or, writing, and, through, tactile, media, such, as, braille, language, is, central, to, the, communication, between, humans, and, to, the, sense, of, identity, that, unites, nations, cultures, and, ethnic, groups, there, are, approximately, six, thousand, different, languages, currently, in, use, including, sign, languages, and, many, thousands, more, that, are, extinct, human, arts, can, take, many, forms, including, visual, literary, and, performing, visual, art, can, range, from, paintings, and, sculptures, to, film, fashion, design, and, architecture, literary, arts, can, include, prose, poetry, and, dramas, the, performing, arts, generally, involve, theatre, music, and, dance, humans, often, combine, the, different, forms, for, example, music, videos, other, entities, that, have, been, described, as, having, artistic, qualities, include, food, preparation, video, games, and, medicine, as, well, as, providing, entertainment, and, transferring, knowledge, the, arts, are, also, used, for, political, purposes, art, is, a, defining, characteristic, of, humans, and, there, is, evidence, for, a, relationship, between, creativity, and, language, the, earliest, evidence, of, art, was, shell, engravings, made, by, homo, erectus, 300, 000, years, before, modern, humans, evolved, art, attributed, to, h, sapiens, existed, at, least, 75, 000, years, ago, with, jewellery, and, drawings, found, in, caves, in, south, africa, there, are, various, hypotheses, as, to, why, humans, have, adapted, to, the, arts, these, include, allowing, them, to, better, problem, solve, issues, providing, a, means, to, control, or, influence, other, humans, encouraging, cooperation, and, contribution, within, a, society, or, increasing, the, chance, of, attracting, a, potential, mate, the, use, of, imagination, developed, through, art, combined, with, logic, may, have, given, early, humans, an, evolutionary, advantage, evidence, of, humans, engaging, in, musical, activities, predates, cave, art, and, so, far, music, has, been, practiced, by, virtually, all, known, human, cultures, there, exists, a, wide, variety, of, music, genres, and, ethnic, musics, with, humans, musical, abilities, being, related, to, other, abilities, including, complex, social, human, behaviours, it, has, been, shown, that, human, brains, respond, to, music, by, becoming, synchronized, with, the, rhythm, and, beat, a, process, called, entrainment, dance, is, also, a, form, of, human, expression, found, in, all, cultures, and, may, have, evolved, as, a, way, to, help, early, humans, communicate, listening, to, music, and, observing, dance, stimulates, the, orbitofrontal, cortex, and, other, pleasure, sensing, areas, of, the, brain, unlike, speaking, reading, and, writing, does, not, come, naturally, to, humans, and, must, be, taught, still, literature, has, been, present, before, the, invention, of, words, and, language, with, 30, 000, year, old, paintings, on, walls, inside, some, caves, portraying, a, series, of, dramatic, scenes, one, of, the, oldest, surviving, works, of, literature, is, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, first, engraved, on, ancient, babylonian, tablets, about, 4, 000, years, ago, beyond, simply, passing, down, knowledge, the, use, and, sharing, of, imaginative, fiction, through, stories, might, have, helped, develop, humans, capabilities, for, communication, and, increased, the, likelihood, of, securing, a, mate, storytelling, may, also, be, used, as, a, way, to, provide, the, audience, with, moral, lessons, and, encourage, cooperation, stone, tools, were, used, by, proto, humans, at, least, 2, 5, million, years, ago, the, use, and, manufacture, of, tools, has, been, put, forward, as, the, ability, that, defines, humans, more, than, anything, else, and, has, historically, been, seen, as, an, important, evolutionary, step, the, technology, became, much, more, sophisticated, about, 1, 8, million, years, ago, with, the, controlled, use, of, fire, beginning, around, 1, million, years, ago, the, wheel, and, wheeled, vehicles, appeared, simultaneously, in, several, regions, some, time, in, the, fourth, millennium, bc, the, development, of, more, complex, tools, and, technologies, allowed, land, to, be, cultivated, and, animals, to, be, domesticated, thus, proving, essential, in, the, development, of, agriculture, what, is, known, as, the, neolithic, revolution, china, developed, paper, the, printing, press, gunpowder, the, compass, and, other, important, inventions, the, continued, improvements, in, smelting, allowed, forging, of, copper, bronze, iron, and, eventually, steel, which, is, used, in, railways, skyscrapers, and, many, other, products, this, coincided, with, the, industrial, revolution, where, the, invention, of, automated, machines, brought, major, changes, to, humans, lifestyles, modern, technology, is, observed, as, progressing, exponentially, with, major, innovations, in, the, 20th, century, including, electricity, penicillin, semiconductors, internal, combustion, engines, the, internet, nitrogen, fixing, fertilizers, airplanes, computers, automobiles, contraceptive, pills, nuclear, fission, the, green, revolution, radio, scientific, plant, breeding, rockets, air, conditioning, television, and, the, assembly, line, definitions, of, religion, vary, according, to, one, definition, a, religion, is, a, belief, system, concerning, the, supernatural, sacred, or, divine, and, practices, values, institutions, and, rituals, associated, with, such, belief, some, religions, also, have, a, moral, code, the, evolution, and, the, history, of, the, first, religions, have, become, areas, of, active, scientific, investigation, credible, evidence, of, religious, behaviour, dates, to, the, middle, paleolithic, era, 45, 200, thousand, years, ago, it, may, have, evolved, to, play, a, role, in, helping, enforce, and, encourage, cooperation, between, humans, religion, manifests, in, diverse, forms, religion, can, include, a, belief, in, life, after, death, the, origin, of, life, the, nature, of, the, universe, religious, cosmology, and, its, ultimate, fate, eschatology, and, moral, or, ethical, teachings, views, on, transcendence, and, immanence, vary, substantially, traditions, variously, espouse, monism, deism, pantheism, and, theism, including, polytheism, and, monotheism, although, measuring, religiosity, is, difficult, a, majority, of, humans, profess, some, variety, of, religious, or, spiritual, belief, in, 2015, the, plurality, were, christian, followed, by, muslims, hindus, and, buddhists, as, of, 2015, about, 16, or, slightly, under, 1, 2, billion, humans, were, irreligious, including, those, with, no, religious, beliefs, or, no, identity, with, any, religion, an, aspect, unique, to, humans, is, their, ability, to, transmit, knowledge, from, one, generation, to, the, next, and, to, continually, build, on, this, information, to, develop, tools, scientific, laws, and, other, advances, to, pass, on, further, this, accumulated, knowledge, can, be, tested, to, answer, questions, or, make, predictions, about, how, the, universe, functions, and, has, been, very, successful, in, advancing, human, ascendancy, aristotle, has, been, described, as, the, first, scientist, and, preceded, the, rise, of, scientific, thought, through, the, hellenistic, period, other, early, advances, in, science, came, from, the, han, dynasty, in, china, and, during, the, islamic, golden, age, the, scientific, revolution, near, the, end, of, the, renaissance, led, to, the, emergence, of, modern, science, a, chain, of, events, and, influences, led, to, the, development, of, the, scientific, method, a, process, of, observation, and, experimentation, that, is, used, to, differentiate, science, from, pseudoscience, an, understanding, of, mathematics, is, unique, to, humans, although, other, species, of, animals, have, some, numerical, cognition, all, of, science, can, be, divided, into, three, major, branches, the, formal, sciences, e, g, logic, and, mathematics, which, are, concerned, with, formal, systems, the, applied, sciences, e, g, engineering, medicine, which, are, focused, on, practical, applications, and, the, empirical, sciences, which, are, based, on, empirical, observation, and, are, in, turn, divided, into, natural, sciences, e, g, physics, chemistry, biology, and, social, sciences, e, g, psychology, economics, sociology, philosophy, is, a, field, of, study, where, humans, seek, to, understand, fundamental, truths, about, themselves, and, the, world, in, which, they, live, philosophical, inquiry, has, been, a, major, feature, in, the, development, of, humans, intellectual, history, it, has, been, described, as, the, no, man, s, land, between, definitive, scientific, knowledge, and, dogmatic, religious, teachings, major, fields, of, philosophy, include, metaphysics, epistemology, logic, and, axiology, which, includes, ethics, and, aesthetics, society, is, the, system, of, organizations, and, institutions, arising, from, interaction, between, humans, humans, are, highly, social, and, tend, to, live, in, large, complex, social, groups, they, can, be, divided, into, different, groups, according, to, their, income, wealth, power, reputation, and, other, factors, the, structure, of, social, stratification, and, the, degree, of, social, mobility, differs, especially, between, modern, and, traditional, societies, human, groups, range, from, the, size, of, families, to, nations, the, first, form, of, human, social, organization, is, thought, to, have, resembled, hunter, gatherer, band, societies, human, societies, typically, exhibit, gender, identities, and, gender, roles, that, distinguish, between, masculine, and, feminine, characteristics, and, prescribe, the, range, of, acceptable, behaviours, and, attitudes, for, their, members, based, on, their, sex, the, most, common, categorisation, is, a, gender, binary, of, men, and, women, some, societies, recognize, a, third, gender, or, less, commonly, a, fourth, or, fifth, in, some, other, societies, non, binary, is, used, as, an, umbrella, term, for, a, range, of, gender, identities, that, are, not, solely, male, or, female, gender, roles, are, often, associated, with, a, division, of, norms, practices, dress, behavior, rights, duties, privileges, status, and, power, with, men, enjoying, more, rights, and, privileges, than, women, in, most, societies, both, today, and, in, the, past, as, a, social, construct, gender, roles, are, not, fixed, and, vary, historically, within, a, society, challenges, to, predominant, gender, norms, have, recurred, in, many, societies, little, is, known, about, gender, roles, in, the, earliest, human, societies, early, modern, humans, probably, had, a, range, of, gender, roles, similar, to, that, of, modern, cultures, from, at, least, the, upper, paleolithic, while, the, neanderthals, were, less, sexually, dimorphic, and, there, is, evidence, that, the, behavioural, difference, between, males, and, females, was, minimal, all, human, societies, organize, recognize, and, classify, types, of, social, relationships, based, on, relations, between, parents, children, and, other, descendants, consanguinity, and, relations, through, marriage, affinity, there, is, also, a, third, type, applied, to, godparents, or, adoptive, children, fictive, these, culturally, defined, relationships, are, referred, to, as, kinship, in, many, societies, it, is, one, of, the, most, important, social, organizing, principles, and, plays, a, role, in, transmitting, status, and, inheritance, all, societies, have, rules, of, incest, taboo, according, to, which, marriage, between, certain, kinds, of, kin, relations, is, prohibited, and, some, also, have, rules, of, preferential, marriage, with, certain, kin, relations, pair, bonding, is, a, ubiquitous, feature, of, human, sexual, relationships, whether, it, is, manifested, as, serial, monogamy, polygyny, or, polyandry, genetic, evidence, indicates, that, humans, were, predominantly, polygynous, for, most, of, their, existence, as, a, species, but, that, this, began, to, shift, during, the, neolithic, when, monogamy, started, becoming, widespread, concomitantly, with, the, transition, from, nomadic, to, sedentary, societies, anatomical, evidence, in, the, form, of, second, to, fourth, digit, ratios, a, biomarker, for, prenatal, androgen, effects, likewise, indicates, modern, humans, were, polygynous, during, the, pleistocene, human, ethnic, groups, are, a, social, category, that, identifies, together, as, a, group, based, on, shared, attributes, that, distinguish, them, from, other, groups, these, can, be, a, common, set, of, traditions, ancestry, language, history, society, culture, nation, religion, or, social, treatment, within, their, residing, area, ethnicity, is, separate, from, the, concept, of, race, which, is, based, on, physical, characteristics, although, both, are, socially, constructed, assigning, ethnicity, to, a, certain, population, is, complicated, as, even, within, common, ethnic, designations, there, can, be, a, diverse, range, of, subgroups, and, the, makeup, of, these, ethnic, groups, can, change, over, time, at, both, the, collective, and, individual, level, also, there, is, no, generally, accepted, definition, of, what, constitutes, an, ethnic, group, ethnic, groupings, can, play, a, powerful, role, in, the, social, identity, and, solidarity, of, ethnopolitical, units, this, has, been, closely, tied, to, the, rise, of, the, nation, state, as, the, predominant, form, of, political, organization, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, as, farming, populations, gathered, in, larger, and, denser, communities, interactions, between, these, different, groups, increased, this, led, to, the, development, of, governance, within, and, between, the, communities, humans, have, evolved, the, ability, to, change, affiliation, with, various, social, groups, relatively, easily, including, previously, strong, political, alliances, if, doing, so, is, seen, as, providing, personal, advantages, this, cognitive, flexibility, allows, individual, humans, to, change, their, political, ideologies, with, those, with, higher, flexibility, less, likely, to, support, authoritarian, and, nationalistic, stances, governments, create, laws, and, policies, that, affect, the, citizens, that, they, govern, there, have, been, many, forms, of, government, throughout, human, history, each, having, various, means, of, obtaining, power, and, the, ability, to, exert, diverse, controls, on, the, population, approximately, 47, of, humans, live, in, some, form, of, a, democracy, 17, in, a, hybrid, regime, and, 37, in, an, authoritarian, regime, many, countries, belong, to, international, organizations, and, alliances, the, largest, of, these, is, the, united, nations, with, 193, member, states, trade, the, voluntary, exchange, of, goods, and, services, is, seen, as, a, characteristic, that, differentiates, humans, from, other, animals, and, has, been, cited, as, a, practice, that, gave, homo, sapiens, a, major, advantage, over, other, hominids, evidence, suggests, early, h, sapiens, made, use, of, long, distance, trade, routes, to, exchange, goods, and, ideas, leading, to, cultural, explosions, and, providing, additional, food, sources, when, hunting, was, sparse, while, such, trade, networks, did, not, exist, for, the, now, extinct, neanderthals, early, trade, likely, involved, materials, for, creating, tools, like, obsidian, the, first, truly, international, trade, routes, were, around, the, spice, trade, through, the, roman, and, medieval, periods, early, human, economies, were, more, likely, to, be, based, around, gift, giving, instead, of, a, bartering, system, early, money, consisted, of, commodities, the, oldest, being, in, the, form, of, cattle, and, the, most, widely, used, being, cowrie, shells, money, has, since, evolved, into, governmental, issued, coins, paper, and, electronic, money, human, study, of, economics, is, a, social, science, that, looks, at, how, societies, distribute, scarce, resources, among, different, people, there, are, massive, inequalities, in, the, division, of, wealth, among, humans, the, eight, richest, humans, are, worth, the, same, monetary, value, as, the, poorest, half, of, all, the, human, population, humans, commit, violence, on, other, humans, at, a, rate, comparable, to, other, primates, but, have, an, increased, preference, for, killing, adults, infanticide, being, more, common, among, other, primates, phylogenetic, analysis, predicts, that, 2, of, early, h, sapiens, would, be, murdered, rising, to, 12, during, the, medieval, period, before, dropping, to, below, 2, in, modern, times, there, is, great, variation, in, violence, between, human, populations, with, rates, of, homicide, about, 0, 01, in, societies, that, have, legal, systems, and, strong, cultural, attitudes, against, violence, the, willingness, of, humans, to, kill, other, members, of, their, species, en, masse, through, organized, conflict, i, e, war, has, long, been, the, subject, of, debate, one, school, of, thought, holds, that, war, evolved, as, a, means, to, eliminate, competitors, and, has, always, been, an, innate, human, characteristic, another, suggests, that, war, is, a, relatively, recent, phenomenon, and, has, appeared, due, to, changing, social, conditions, while, not, settled, current, evidence, indicates, warlike, predispositions, only, became, common, about, 10, 000, years, ago, and, in, many, places, much, more, recently, than, that, war, has, had, a, high, cost, on, human, life, it, is, estimated, that, during, the, 20th, century, between, 167, million, and, 188, million, people, died, as, a, result, of, war, war, casualty, data, is, less, reliable, for, pre, medieval, times, especially, global, figures, but, compared, with, any, period, over, the, past, 600, years, the, last, 80, years, post, 1946, has, seen, a, very, significant, drop, in, global, military, and, civilian, death, rates, due, to, armed, conflict
