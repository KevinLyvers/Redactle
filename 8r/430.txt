locusts, derived, from, the, latin, locusta, locust, or, lobster, are, various, species, of, short, horned, grasshoppers, in, the, family, acrididae, that, have, a, swarming, phase, these, insects, are, usually, solitary, but, under, certain, circumstances, they, become, more, abundant, and, change, their, behaviour, and, habits, becoming, gregarious, no, taxonomic, distinction, is, made, between, locust, and, grasshopper, species, the, basis, for, the, definition, is, whether, a, species, forms, swarms, under, intermittently, suitable, conditions, this, has, evolved, independently, in, multiple, lineages, comprising, at, least, 18, genera, in, 5, different, subfamilies, normally, these, grasshoppers, are, innocuous, their, numbers, are, low, and, they, do, not, pose, a, major, economic, threat, to, agriculture, however, under, suitable, conditions, of, drought, followed, by, rapid, vegetation, growth, serotonin, in, their, brains, triggers, dramatic, changes, they, start, to, breed, abundantly, becoming, gregarious, and, nomadic, loosely, described, as, migratory, when, their, populations, become, dense, enough, they, form, bands, of, wingless, nymphs, that, later, become, swarms, of, winged, adults, both, the, bands, and, the, swarms, move, around, rapidly, strip, fields, and, damage, crops, the, adults, are, powerful, fliers, they, can, travel, great, distances, consuming, most, of, the, green, vegetation, wherever, the, swarm, settles, locusts, have, formed, plagues, since, prehistory, the, ancient, egyptians, carved, them, on, their, tombs, and, the, insects, are, mentioned, in, the, iliad, the, mahabharata, the, bible, and, quran, swarms, have, devastated, crops, and, have, caused, famines, and, human, migrations, more, recently, changes, in, agricultural, practices, and, better, surveillance, of, locust, breeding, grounds, have, allowed, control, measures, at, an, early, stage, traditional, locust, control, uses, insecticides, from, the, ground, or, air, but, newer, biological, control, methods, are, proving, effective, swarming, behaviour, decreased, in, the, 20th, century, but, despite, modern, surveillance, and, control, methods, swarms, can, still, form, when, suitable, weather, conditions, occur, and, vigilance, lapses, plagues, can, occur, locusts, are, large, insects, and, convenient, for, research, and, classroom, study, of, zoology, they, are, edible, by, humans, they, have, been, eaten, throughout, history, and, are, considered, a, delicacy, in, many, countries, locusts, are, the, swarming, phase, of, certain, species, of, short, horned, grasshoppers, in, the, family, acrididae, these, insects, are, usually, solitary, but, under, certain, circumstances, become, more, abundant, and, change, their, behaviour, and, habits, becoming, gregarious, no, taxonomic, distinction, is, made, between, locust, and, grasshopper, species, the, basis, for, the, definition, is, whether, a, species, forms, swarms, under, intermittently, suitable, conditions, in, english, the, term, locust, is, used, for, grasshopper, species, that, change, morphologically, and, behaviourally, on, crowding, forming, swarms, that, develop, from, bands, of, immature, stages, called, hoppers, the, change, is, described, as, density, dependent, phenotypic, plasticity, these, changes, are, examples, of, phase, polyphenism, they, were, first, analysed, and, described, by, boris, uvarov, who, was, instrumental, in, setting, up, the, anti, locust, research, centre, he, made, his, discoveries, during, his, studies, of, the, migratory, locust, in, the, caucasus, whose, solitary, and, gregarious, phases, had, previously, been, thought, to, be, separate, species, locusta, migratoria, and, l, danica, l, he, designated, the, two, phases, as, solitaria, and, gregaria, these, are, called, statary, and, migratory, morphs, though, strictly, speaking, their, swarms, are, nomadic, rather, than, migratory, charles, valentine, riley, and, norman, criddle, were, involved, in, achieving, the, understanding, and, control, of, locusts, swarming, behaviour, is, a, response, to, overcrowding, increased, tactile, stimulation, of, the, hind, legs, causes, an, increase, in, levels, of, serotonin, this, causes, the, locust, to, change, colour, eat, much, more, and, breed, much, more, easily, the, transformation, of, the, locust, to, the, swarming, form, is, induced, by, several, contacts, per, minute, over, a, four, hour, period, a, large, swarm, can, consist, of, billions, of, locusts, spread, out, over, an, area, of, thousands, of, square, kilometres, with, a, population, of, up, to, 80, million, per, square, kilometre, 200, million, per, square, mile, when, desert, locusts, meet, their, nervous, systems, release, serotonin, which, causes, them, to, become, mutually, attracted, a, prerequisite, for, swarming, the, formation, of, initial, bands, of, gregarious, hoppers, is, called, an, outbreak, when, these, join, into, larger, groups, the, event, is, known, as, an, upsurge, continuing, agglomerations, of, upsurges, on, a, regional, level, originating, from, a, number, of, entirely, separate, breeding, locations, are, known, as, plagues, during, outbreaks, and, the, early, stages, of, upsurges, only, part, of, the, locust, population, becomes, gregarious, with, scattered, bands, of, hoppers, spread, out, over, a, large, area, as, time, goes, by, the, insects, become, more, cohesive, and, the, bands, become, concentrated, in, a, smaller, area, in, the, desert, locust, plague, in, africa, the, middle, east, and, asia, that, lasted, from, 1966, to, 1969, the, number, of, locusts, increased, from, two, to, 30, billion, over, two, generations, but, the, area, covered, decreased, from, over, 100, 000, square, kilometres, 39, 000, sq, mi, to, 5, 000, square, kilometres, 1, 900, sq, mi, one, of, the, greatest, differences, between, the, solitary, and, gregarious, phases, is, behavioural, the, gregaria, nymphs, are, attracted, to, each, other, this, being, seen, as, early, as, the, second, instar, they, soon, form, bands, of, many, thousands, of, individuals, these, groups, behave, like, cohesive, units, and, move, across, the, landscape, mostly, downhill, but, making, their, way, around, barriers, and, merging, with, other, bands, the, attraction, between, the, insects, involves, visual, and, olfactory, cues, the, bands, seem, to, navigate, using, the, sun, they, pause, to, feed, at, intervals, before, continuing, on, and, may, cover, tens, of, kilometres, over, a, few, weeks, locusts, in, the, gregarious, phase, differ, in, morphology, and, development, in, the, desert, locust, and, the, migratory, locust, for, example, the, gregaria, nymphs, become, darker, with, strongly, contrasting, yellow, and, black, markings, they, grow, larger, and, have, a, longer, nymphal, period, the, adults, are, larger, with, different, body, proportions, less, sexual, dimorphism, and, higher, metabolic, rates, they, mature, more, rapidly, and, start, reproducing, earlier, but, have, lower, levels, of, fecundity, the, mutual, attraction, between, individual, insects, continues, into, adulthood, and, they, continue, to, act, as, a, cohesive, group, individuals, that, get, detached, from, a, swarm, fly, back, into, the, mass, others, that, get, left, behind, after, feeding, take, off, to, rejoin, the, swarm, when, it, passes, overhead, when, individuals, at, the, front, of, the, swarm, settle, to, feed, others, fly, past, overhead, and, settle, in, their, turn, the, whole, swarm, acting, like, a, rolling, unit, with, an, ever, changing, leading, edge, the, locusts, spend, much, time, on, the, ground, feeding, and, resting, moving, on, when, the, vegetation, is, exhausted, they, may, then, fly, a, considerable, distance, before, settling, in, a, location, where, transitory, rainfall, has, caused, a, green, flush, of, new, growth, several, species, of, grasshoppers, swarm, as, locusts, in, different, parts, of, the, world, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, for, example, the, australian, plague, locust, chortoicetes, terminifera, swarms, across, australia, the, desert, locust, schistocerca, gregaria, is, probably, the, best, known, species, owing, to, its, wide, distribution, north, africa, middle, east, and, indian, subcontinent, and, its, ability, to, migrate, over, long, distances, a, major, infestation, covered, much, of, western, africa, from, 2003, to, 2005, after, unusually, heavy, rain, set, up, favourable, ecological, conditions, for, swarming, the, first, outbreaks, occurred, in, mauritania, mali, niger, and, sudan, in, 2003, the, rain, allowed, swarms, to, develop, and, move, north, to, morocco, and, algeria, threatening, croplands, swarms, crossed, africa, appearing, in, egypt, jordan, and, israel, the, first, time, in, those, countries, for, 50, years, the, cost, of, handling, the, infestation, was, put, at, us, 122, million, and, the, damage, to, crops, at, up, to, 2, 5, billion, the, migratory, locust, locusta, migratoria, sometimes, classified, into, up, to, 10, subspecies, swarms, in, africa, asia, australia, and, new, zealand, but, has, become, rare, in, europe, in, 2013, the, madagascan, form, of, the, migratory, locust, formed, many, swarms, of, over, a, billion, insects, reaching, plague, status, and, covering, about, half, the, country, by, march, 2013, species, such, as, the, senegalese, grasshopper, oedaleus, senegalensis, and, the, african, rice, grasshopper, hieroglyphus, daganensis, both, from, the, sahel, often, display, locust, like, behaviour, and, change, morphologically, on, crowding, north, america, is, the, only, sub, continent, besides, antarctica, without, a, native, locust, species, the, rocky, mountain, locust, was, formerly, one, of, the, most, significant, insect, pests, there, but, it, became, extinct, in, 1902, in, the, 1930s, during, the, dust, bowl, a, second, species, of, north, american, locust, the, high, plains, locust, dissosteira, longipennis, reached, plague, proportions, in, the, american, midwest, today, the, high, plains, locust, is, a, rare, species, leaving, north, america, with, no, regularly, swarming, locusts, study, of, literature, shows, how, pervasive, plagues, of, locusts, were, over, the, course, of, history, the, insects, arrived, unexpectedly, often, after, a, change, of, wind, direction, or, weather, and, the, consequences, were, devastating, the, ancient, egyptians, carved, locusts, on, tombs, in, the, period, 2470, to, 2220, bc, a, devastating, plague, in, egypt, is, mentioned, in, the, book, of, exodus, in, the, bible, locust, plague, is, mentioned, in, the, indian, mahabharata, the, iliad, mentions, locusts, taking, to, the, wing, to, escape, fire, plagues, of, locusts, are, mentioned, in, the, quran, in, the, ninth, century, bc, the, chinese, authorities, appointed, anti, locust, officers, in, the, new, testament, john, the, baptist, was, said, to, survive, in, the, wilderness, on, locusts, and, wild, honey, and, human, headed, locusts, appear, in, the, book, of, revelation, aristotle, studied, locusts, and, their, breeding, habits, and, livy, recorded, a, devastating, plague, in, capua, in, 203, bc, he, mentioned, human, epidemics, following, locust, plagues, which, he, associated, with, the, stench, from, the, putrifying, corpses, the, linking, of, human, disease, outbreaks, to, locust, plagues, was, widespread, a, pestilence, in, the, northwestern, provinces, of, china, in, 311, ad, that, killed, 98, of, the, population, locally, was, blamed, on, locusts, and, may, have, been, caused, by, an, increase, in, numbers, of, rats, and, their, fleas, that, devoured, the, locust, carcasses, during, the, last, two, millennia, desert, locust, plagues, have, appeared, sporadically, in, africa, the, middle, east, and, europe, other, species, of, locusts, caused, havoc, in, north, and, south, america, asia, and, australasia, in, china, 173, outbreaks, over, 1924, years, the, bombay, locust, nomadacris, succincta, was, a, major, pest, in, india, and, southeastern, asia, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, but, has, seldom, swarmed, since, the, last, plague, in, 1908, in, the, spring, of, 1747, locusts, arrived, outside, damascus, eating, the, majority, of, the, crops, and, vegetation, of, the, surrounding, countryside, one, local, barber, ahmad, al, budayri, recalled, the, locusts, came, like, a, black, cloud, they, covered, everything, the, trees, and, the, crops, may, god, almighty, save, us, the, extinction, of, the, rocky, mountain, locust, has, been, a, source, of, puzzlement, it, had, swarmed, throughout, the, west, of, the, united, states, and, parts, of, canada, in, the, 19th, century, albert, s, swarm, of, 1875, was, estimated, to, contain, 12, 5, trillion, insects, covering, an, area, of, 198, 000, square, miles, 510, 000, km, 2, larger, than, the, state, of, california, and, to, weigh, 27, 5, million, tons, the, last, specimen, was, seen, alive, in, canada, in, 1902, recent, research, suggests, the, breeding, grounds, of, this, insect, in, the, valleys, of, the, rocky, mountains, came, under, sustained, agricultural, development, during, the, large, influx, of, gold, miners, destroying, the, underground, eggs, of, the, locust, the, 1915, infestation, across, palestine, and, syria, was, one, of, the, main, contributors, to, famine, in, lebanon, which, lasted, from, 1915, to, 1918, during, which, around, 200, 000, people, died, plagues, became, less, common, in, the, 20th, century, but, they, continue, to, occur, when, the, conditions, are, met, early, intervention, to, prevent, large, locust, swarms, is, more, successful, than, later, action, once, swarms, have, built, up, the, means, to, control, locust, populations, is, now, available, but, organisational, financial, and, political, problems, may, be, difficult, to, overcome, monitoring, is, the, key, to, early, detection, and, eradication, ideally, a, sufficient, proportion, of, nomadic, bands, can, be, killed, with, insecticide, before, their, swarming, phase, this, may, be, possible, in, richer, countries, like, morocco, and, saudi, arabia, but, neighbouring, poorer, countries, such, as, mauritania, and, yemen, lack, the, resources, and, may, breed, locust, swarms, that, threaten, the, whole, region, several, organisations, around, the, world, monitor, the, threat, from, locusts, they, provide, forecasts, detailing, regions, likely, to, suffer, from, locust, plagues, in, the, near, future, in, australia, this, service, is, provided, by, the, australian, plague, locust, commission, it, has, been, very, successful, in, dealing, with, developing, outbreaks, but, has, the, great, advantage, of, having, a, defined, area, to, monitor, and, defend, without, locust, invasions, from, elsewhere, in, central, and, southern, africa, the, service, is, provided, by, the, international, locust, control, organization, for, central, and, southern, africa, in, west, and, northwest, africa, the, service, is, co, ordinated, by, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, s, commission, for, controlling, the, desert, locust, in, the, western, region, and, executed, by, locust, control, agencies, belonging, to, each, country, concerned, the, fao, monitors, the, situation, in, the, caucasus, and, central, asia, where, over, 25, million, hectares, of, cultivated, land, are, under, threat, in, february, 2020, in, an, effort, to, end, massive, locust, outbreaks, india, decided, to, use, drones, and, special, equipment, to, monitor, locusts, and, spray, insecticides, historically, people, could, do, little, to, protect, their, crops, from, locusts, although, eating, the, insects, may, have, been, some, compensation, by, the, early, 20th, century, efforts, were, made, to, disrupt, the, development, of, the, insects, by, cultivating, the, soil, where, eggs, were, laid, collecting, hoppers, with, catching, machines, killing, them, with, flamethrowers, trapping, them, in, ditches, and, crushing, them, with, rollers, and, other, mechanical, methods, by, the, 1950s, the, organochloride, dieldrin, was, found, to, be, an, extremely, effective, insecticide, but, it, was, later, banned, in, most, countries, because, of, its, persistence, in, the, environment, and, its, accumulation, in, the, food, chain, in, years, when, locust, control, is, needed, the, hoppers, are, targeted, early, by, applying, water, based, contact, pesticides, from, tractor, based, sprayers, this, is, effective, but, slow, and, labour, intensive, a, preferable, method, is, spraying, concentrated, insecticide, from, aircraft, over, the, insects, or, vegetation, the, use, of, ultralow, volume, spraying, of, contact, pesticides, from, aircraft, in, overlapping, swathes, is, effective, against, nomadic, bands, and, can, be, used, to, treat, large, areas, of, land, swiftly, other, modern, technologies, for, planning, locust, control, include, gps, gis, tools, and, satellite, imagery, with, rapid, computer, data, management, and, analysis, a, biological, pesticide, to, control, locusts, was, tested, across, africa, by, a, multinational, team, in, 1997, dried, fungal, spores, of, a, metarhizium, acridum, sprayed, in, breeding, areas, pierce, the, locust, exoskeleton, on, germination, and, invade, the, body, cavity, causing, death, the, fungus, is, passed, from, insect, to, insect, and, persists, in, the, area, making, repeated, treatments, unnecessary, this, approach, to, locust, control, was, used, in, tanzania, in, 2009, to, treat, around, 10, 000, hectares, in, the, iku, katavi, national, park, infested, with, adult, locusts, the, outbreak, was, contained, without, harm, to, the, local, elephants, hippopotamuses, and, giraffes, the, locust, is, large, and, easy, to, breed, and, rear, and, is, used, as, an, experimental, model, in, research, studies, it, has, been, used, in, evolutionary, biology, research, and, to, test, the, generalizability, of, conclusions, reached, about, test, organisms, such, as, the, fruit, fly, drosophila, and, the, housefly, musca, it, is, a, suitable, school, laboratory, animal, because, of, its, robustness, and, ease, of, breeding, and, handling, at, tel, aviv, university, scientists, have, been, using, the, antennae, s, acute, sensitivity, of, sense, of, smell, to, detect, different, odors, in, various, technologies, locusts, have, been, used, as, food, throughout, history, they, are, considered, meat, several, cultures, throughout, the, world, consume, insects, and, locusts, are, considered, a, delicacy, in, many, african, middle, eastern, and, asian, countries, they, can, be, cooked, in, many, ways, but, are, often, fried, smoked, or, dried, the, bible, records, that, john, the, baptist, ate, locusts, and, wild, honey, greek, romanized, akr, des, ka, m, li, grion, while, living, in, the, wilderness, attempts, have, been, made, to, explain, the, text, to, mean, ascetic, vegetarian, food, such, as, carob, beans, but, the, plain, meaning, of, the, greek, akrides, is, locust, the, torah, prohibits, the, use, of, most, insects, as, food, but, it, permits, consuming, certain, types, of, locust, specifically, those, that, are, red, yellow, or, spotted, grey, islamic, jurisprudence, deems, eating, locusts, to, be, halal, the, prophet, muhammad, was, reported, to, have, eaten, locusts, during, a, military, raid, with, his, companions, locusts, are, eaten, in, the, arabian, peninsula, including, saudi, arabia, in, 2014, consumption, of, locusts, spiked, around, ramadan, especially, in, the, al, qassim, region, since, many, saudis, believe, they, are, healthy, to, eat, but, the, saudi, ministry, of, health, warned, that, pesticides, made, them, unsafe, yemenis, also, consume, locusts, and, expressed, discontent, over, governmental, plans, to, use, pesticides, against, them, abd, al, sal, m, shab, n, described, a, locust, recipe, from, morocco, 19th, century, european, travellers, observed, arabs, in, arabia, egypt, and, morocco, selling, cooking, and, eating, locusts, they, reported, that, in, egypt, and, palestine, locusts, were, consumed, and, that, in, palestine, around, the, river, jordan, in, egypt, in, arabia, and, in, morocco, that, arabs, ate, locusts, while, syrian, peasants, did, not, eat, locusts, in, the, haouran, region, fellahs, who, were, in, poverty, and, suffered, from, famine, ate, locusts, after, removing, the, guts, and, head, while, locusts, were, swallowed, whole, by, bedouins, syrians, copts, greeks, armenians, and, other, christians, and, arabs, themselves, reported, that, in, arabia, locusts, were, eaten, frequently, and, one, arab, described, to, a, european, traveler, the, different, types, of, locusts, which, were, favored, as, food, by, arabs, persians, use, the, anti, arab, racial, slur, arabe, malakh, khor, persian, literally, locust, eater, arab, against, arabs, locusts, yield, about, five, times, more, edible, protein, per, unit, of, fodder, than, cattle, and, produce, lower, levels, of, greenhouse, gases, in, the, process, the, feed, conversion, rate, of, orthopterans, is, 1, 7, kg, kg, while, for, beef, it, is, typically, about, 10, kg, kg, the, protein, content, in, fresh, weight, is, between, 13, and, 28, g, 100, g, for, adult, locust, 14, 18, g, 100, g, for, larvae, as, compared, to, 19, 26, g, 100, g, for, beef, the, calculated, protein, efficiency, ratio, is, low, with, 1, 69, for, locust, protein, compared, to, 2, 5, for, standard, casein, a, serving, of, 100,
