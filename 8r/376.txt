earwigs, make, up, the, insect, order, dermaptera, with, about, 2, 000, species, in, 12, families, they, are, one, of, the, smaller, insect, orders, earwigs, have, characteristic, cerci, a, pair, of, forceps, like, pincers, on, their, abdomen, and, membranous, wings, folded, underneath, short, rarely, used, forewings, hence, the, scientific, order, name, skin, wings, some, groups, are, tiny, parasites, on, mammals, and, lack, the, typical, pincers, earwigs, are, found, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, earwigs, are, mostly, nocturnal, and, often, hide, in, small, moist, crevices, during, the, day, and, are, active, at, night, feeding, on, a, wide, variety, of, insects, and, plants, damage, to, foliage, flowers, and, various, crops, is, commonly, blamed, on, earwigs, especially, the, common, earwig, forficula, auricularia, earwigs, have, five, molts, in, the, year, before, they, become, adults, many, earwig, species, display, maternal, care, which, is, uncommon, among, insects, female, earwigs, may, care, for, their, eggs, the, ones, that, do, will, continue, to, watch, over, nymphs, until, their, second, molt, as, the, nymphs, molt, sexual, dimorphism, such, as, differences, in, pincer, shapes, begins, to, show, extant, dermaptera, belong, to, the, suborder, neodermaptera, which, first, appeared, during, the, cretaceous, some, earwig, specimen, fossils, are, placed, with, extinct, suborders, archidermaptera, or, eodermaptera, the, former, dating, to, the, late, triassic, and, the, latter, to, the, middle, jurassic, dermaptera, belongs, to, the, major, grouping, polyneoptera, and, are, amongst, the, earliest, diverging, members, of, the, group, alongside, angel, insects, zoraptera, and, stoneflies, plecoptera, but, the, exact, relationship, among, the, three, groups, is, uncertain, the, scientific, name, for, the, order, dermaptera, is, greek, in, origin, stemming, from, the, words, derma, meaning, skin, and, pteron, plural, ptera, meaning, wing, it, was, coined, by, charles, de, geer, in, 1773, the, common, term, earwig, is, derived, from, the, old, english, are, which, means, ear, and, wicga, which, means, insect, or, literally, beetle, entomologists, suggest, that, the, origin, of, the, name, is, a, reference, to, the, appearance, of, the, hindwings, which, are, unique, and, distinctive, among, insects, and, resemble, a, human, ear, when, unfolded, the, name, is, more, popularly, thought, to, be, related, to, the, old, wives, tale, that, earwigs, burrowed, into, the, brains, of, humans, through, the, ear, and, laid, their, eggs, there, earwigs, are, not, known, to, purposefully, climb, into, ear, canals, but, there, has, been, at, least, one, anecdotal, report, of, earwigs, being, found, in, the, ear, earwigs, are, abundant, and, can, be, found, throughout, the, americas, and, eurasia, the, common, earwig, was, introduced, into, north, america, in, 1907, from, europe, but, tends, to, be, more, common, in, the, southern, and, southwestern, parts, of, the, united, states, 739, the, only, native, species, of, earwig, found, in, the, north, of, the, united, states, is, the, spine, tailed, earwig, doru, aculeatum, found, as, far, north, as, canada, where, it, hides, in, the, leaf, axils, of, emerging, plants, in, southern, ontario, wetlands, however, other, families, can, be, found, in, north, america, including, forficulidae, doru, and, forficula, being, found, there, spongiphoridae, anisolabididae, and, labiduridae, few, earwigs, survive, winter, outdoors, in, cold, climates, they, can, be, found, in, tight, crevices, in, woodland, fields, and, gardens, 739, out, of, about, 1, 800, species, about, 25, occur, in, north, america, 45, in, europe, including, 7, in, great, britain, and, 60, in, australia, most, earwigs, are, flattened, which, allows, them, to, fit, inside, tight, crevices, such, as, under, bark, with, an, elongated, body, generally, 7, 50, millimetres, 1, 4, 2, in, long, the, largest, extant, species, is, the, australian, giant, earwig, titanolabis, colossea, which, is, approximately, 50, mm, 2, in, long, 10, while, the, possibly, extinct, declared, extinct, in, 2014, saint, helena, earwig, labidura, herculeana, reached, 78, mm, 3, 1, 16, in, earwigs, are, characterized, by, the, cerci, or, the, pair, of, forceps, like, pincers, on, their, abdomen, male, earwigs, generally, have, more, curved, pincers, than, females, these, pincers, are, used, to, capture, prey, defend, themselves, and, fold, their, wings, under, the, short, tegmina, the, antennae, are, thread, like, with, at, least, 10, segments, 738, 739, males, in, the, six, families, karschiellidae, pygidicranidae, diplatyidae, apachyidae, anisolabisidae, and, labiduridae, have, paired, penises, while, the, males, in, the, remaining, groups, have, a, single, penis, both, penises, are, symmetrical, in, pygidicranidae, and, diplatyidae, but, in, karschiellidae, the, left, one, is, strongly, reduced, apachyidae, anisolabisidae, and, labiduridae, have, an, asymmetrical, pair, with, left, and, right, one, pointing, on, opposite, directions, when, not, in, use, the, females, have, just, a, single, genital, opening, so, only, one, of, the, paired, penises, is, ever, used, during, copulation, the, forewings, are, short, oblong, leathery, plates, used, to, cover, the, hindwings, like, the, elytra, of, a, beetle, rather, than, to, fly, most, species, have, short, and, leather, like, forewings, with, very, thin, hindwings, though, species, in, the, former, suborders, arixeniina, and, hemimerina, epizoic, species, sometimes, considered, as, ectoparasites, are, wingless, and, blind, with, filiform, segmented, cerci, today, these, are, both, included, merely, as, families, in, the, suborder, neodermaptera, the, hindwing, is, a, very, thin, membrane, that, expands, like, a, fan, radiating, from, one, point, folded, under, the, forewing, even, though, most, earwigs, have, wings, and, are, capable, of, flight, they, are, rarely, seen, in, flight, these, wings, are, unique, in, venation, and, in, the, pattern, of, folding, that, requires, the, use, of, the, cerci, the, neuroendocrine, system, is, typical, of, insects, there, is, a, brain, a, subesophageal, ganglion, three, thoracic, ganglia, and, six, abdominal, ganglia, strong, neuron, connections, connect, the, neurohemal, corpora, cardiaca, to, the, brain, and, frontal, ganglion, where, the, closely, related, median, corpus, allatum, produces, juvenile, hormone, iii, in, close, proximity, to, the, neurohemal, dorsal, arota, the, digestive, system, of, earwigs, is, like, all, other, insects, consisting, of, a, fore, mid, and, hindgut, but, earwigs, lack, gastric, caecae, which, are, specialized, for, digestion, in, many, species, of, insect, long, slender, excretory, malpighian, tubules, can, be, found, between, the, junction, of, the, mid, and, hind, gut, the, reproductive, system, of, females, consist, of, paired, ovaries, lateral, oviducts, spermatheca, and, a, genital, chamber, the, lateral, ducts, are, where, the, eggs, leave, the, body, while, the, spermatheca, is, where, sperm, is, stored, unlike, other, insects, the, gonopore, or, genital, opening, is, behind, the, seventh, abdominal, segment, the, ovaries, are, primitive, in, that, they, are, polytrophic, the, nurse, cells, and, oocytes, alternate, along, the, length, of, the, ovariole, in, some, species, these, long, ovarioles, branch, off, the, lateral, duct, while, in, others, short, ovarioles, appear, around, the, duct, earwigs, are, hemimetabolous, meaning, they, undergo, incomplete, metamorphosis, developing, through, a, series, of, 4, to, 6, molts, the, developmental, stages, between, molts, are, called, instars, earwigs, live, for, about, a, year, from, hatching, they, start, mating, in, the, autumn, and, can, be, found, together, in, the, autumn, and, winter, the, male, and, female, will, live, in, a, chamber, in, debris, crevices, or, soil, 2, 5, centimetres, 1, in, deep, 739, after, mating, the, sperm, may, remain, in, the, female, for, months, before, the, eggs, are, fertilized, from, midwinter, to, early, spring, the, male, will, leave, or, be, driven, out, by, the, female, afterward, the, female, will, begin, to, lay, 20, to, 80, pearly, white, eggs, in, two, days, some, earwigs, those, parasitic, in, the, suborders, arixeniina, and, hemimerina, are, viviparous, give, birth, to, live, young, they, would, be, fed, by, a, sort, of, placenta, 739, 740, when, first, laid, the, eggs, are, white, or, cream, colored, and, oval, shaped, but, right, before, hatching, they, become, kidney, shaped, and, brown, each, egg, is, approximately, 1, mm, 1, 32, in, tall, and, 0, 8, mm, 1, 32, in, wide, earwigs, are, among, the, few, non, social, insect, species, that, show, maternal, care, the, mother, pays, close, attention, to, the, needs, of, her, eggs, such, as, warmth, and, protection, 739, 740, she, faithfully, defends, the, eggs, from, predators, not, leaving, them, even, to, eat, unless, the, clutch, goes, bad, 740, she, also, continuously, cleans, the, eggs, to, protect, them, from, fungi, studies, have, found, that, the, urge, to, clean, the, eggs, persists, for, only, a, few, days, after, they, are, removed, and, does, not, return, even, if, the, eggs, are, replaced, however, when, the, eggs, were, continuously, replaced, after, hatching, the, mother, continued, to, clean, the, new, eggs, for, up, to, 3, months, 740, studies, have, also, shown, that, the, mother, does, not, immediately, recognize, her, own, eggs, after, laying, them, she, gathers, them, together, and, studies, have, found, mothers, to, pick, up, small, egg, shaped, wax, balls, or, stones, by, accident, eventually, the, impostor, eggs, were, rejected, for, not, having, the, proper, scent, 740, the, eggs, hatch, in, about, seven, days, the, mother, may, assist, the, nymphs, in, hatching, when, the, nymphs, hatch, they, eat, the, egg, casing, and, continue, to, live, with, the, mother, the, nymphs, look, similar, to, their, parents, only, smaller, and, will, nest, under, their, mother, and, she, will, continue, to, protect, them, until, their, second, molt, the, nymphs, feed, on, food, regurgitated, by, the, mother, and, on, their, own, molts, if, the, mother, dies, before, the, nymphs, are, ready, to, leave, the, nymphs, may, eat, her, 740, after, five, to, six, instars, the, nymphs, will, molt, into, adults, the, male, s, forceps, will, become, curved, while, the, females, forceps, remain, straight, they, will, also, develop, their, natural, color, which, can, be, anything, from, a, light, brown, as, in, the, tawny, earwig, to, a, dark, black, as, in, the, ringlegged, earwig, in, species, of, winged, earwigs, the, wings, will, start, to, develop, at, this, time, the, forewings, of, an, earwig, are, sclerotized, to, serve, as, protection, for, the, membranous, hindwings, most, earwigs, are, nocturnal, and, inhabit, small, crevices, living, in, small, amounts, of, debris, in, various, forms, such, as, bark, and, fallen, logs, species, have, been, found, to, be, blind, and, living, in, caves, or, cavernicolous, reported, to, be, found, on, the, island, of, hawaii, and, in, south, africa, food, typically, consists, of, a, wide, array, of, living, and, dead, plant, and, animal, matter, for, protection, from, predators, the, species, doru, taeniatum, of, earwigs, can, squirt, foul, smelling, yellow, liquid, in, the, form, of, jets, from, scent, glands, on, the, dorsal, side, of, the, third, and, fourth, abdominal, segment, it, aims, the, discharges, by, revolving, the, abdomen, a, maneuver, that, enables, it, simultaneously, to, use, its, pincers, in, defense, under, exceptional, circumstances, earwigs, form, swarms, and, can, take, over, significant, areas, of, a, district, in, august, 1755, they, appeared, in, vast, numbers, near, stroud, gloucestershire, uk, especially, in, the, cracks, and, crevices, of, old, wooden, buildings, so, that, they, dropped, out, oftentimes, in, such, multitudes, as, to, literally, cover, the, floor, a, similar, plague, occurred, in, 2006, in, and, around, a, woodland, cabin, near, the, blue, ridge, mountains, of, the, eastern, united, states, it, persisted, through, winter, and, lasted, at, least, two, years, earwigs, are, mostly, scavengers, but, some, are, omnivorous, or, predatory, 739, 740, the, abdomen, of, the, earwig, is, flexible, and, muscular, it, is, capable, of, maneuvering, as, well, as, opening, and, closing, the, forceps, the, forceps, are, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, in, some, species, the, forceps, have, been, observed, in, use, for, holding, prey, and, in, copulation, the, forceps, tend, to, be, more, curved, in, males, than, in, females, the, common, earwig, is, an, omnivore, eating, plants, and, ripe, fruit, as, well, as, actively, hunting, arthropods, to, a, large, extent, this, species, is, also, a, scavenger, feeding, on, decaying, plant, and, animal, matter, if, given, the, chance, observed, prey, include, largely, plant, lice, but, also, large, insects, such, as, bluebottle, flies, and, woolly, aphids, plants, that, they, feed, on, typically, include, clover, dahlias, zinnias, butterfly, bush, hollyhock, lettuce, cauliflower, strawberry, blackberry, sunflowers, celery, peaches, plums, grapes, potatoes, roses, seedling, beans, and, beets, and, tender, grass, shoots, and, roots, they, have, also, been, known, to, eat, corn, silk, damaging, the, crop, species, of, the, suborders, arixeniina, and, hemimerina, are, generally, considered, epizoic, or, living, on, the, outside, of, other, animals, mainly, mammals, in, the, arixeniina, family, arixeniidae, species, of, the, genus, arixenia, are, normally, found, deep, in, the, skin, folds, and, gular, pouch, of, malaysian, hairless, bulldog, bats, cheiromeles, torquatus, apparently, feeding, on, bats, body, or, glandular, secretions, on, the, other, hand, species, in, the, genus, xeniaria, still, of, the, suborder, arixeniina, are, believed, to, feed, on, the, guano, and, possibly, the, guanophilous, arthropods, in, the, bat, s, roost, where, it, has, been, found, hemimerina, includes, araeomerus, found, in, the, nest, of, long, tailed, pouch, rats, beamys, and, hemimerus, which, are, found, on, giant, cricetomys, rats, earwigs, are, generally, nocturnal, and, typically, hide, in, small, dark, and, often, moist, areas, in, the, daytime, they, can, usually, be, seen, on, household, walls, and, ceilings, interaction, with, earwigs, at, this, time, results, in, a, defensive, free, fall, to, the, ground, followed, by, a, scramble, to, a, nearby, cleft, or, crevice, during, the, summer, they, can, be, found, around, damp, areas, such, as, near, sinks, and, in, bathrooms, earwigs, tend, to, gather, in, shady, cracks, or, openings, or, anywhere, that, they, can, remain, concealed, during, daylight, picnic, tables, compost, and, waste, bins, patios, lawn, furniture, window, frames, or, anything, with, minute, spaces, even, artichoke, blossoms, can, potentially, harbour, them, earwigs, are, regularly, preyed, upon, by, birds, and, like, many, other, insect, species, they, are, prey, for, insectivorous, mammals, amphibians, lizards, centipedes, assassin, bugs, and, spiders, european, naturalists, have, observed, bats, preying, upon, earwigs, their, primary, insect, predators, are, parasitic, species, of, tachinidae, or, tachinid, flies, whose, larvae, are, endoparasites, one, species, of, tachinid, fly, triarthria, setipennis, has, been, demonstrated, to, be, successful, as, a, biological, control, of, earwigs, for, almost, a, century, another, tachinid, fly, and, parasite, of, earwigs, ocytata, pallipes, has, shown, promise, as, a, biological, control, agent, as, well, the, common, predatory, wasp, the, yellow, jacket, vespula, maculifrons, preys, upon, earwigs, when, abundant, a, small, species, of, roundworm, mermis, nigrescens, is, known, to, occasionally, parasitize, earwigs, that, have, consumed, roundworm, eggs, with, plant, matter, at, least, 26, species, of, parasitic, fungus, from, the, order, laboulbeniales, have, been, found, on, earwigs, the, eggs, and, nymphs, are, also, cannibalized, by, other, earwigs, a, species, of, tyroglyphoid, mite, histiostoma, polypori, histiostomatidae, astigmata, are, observed, on, common, earwigs, sometimes, in, great, densities, however, this, mite, feeds, on, earwig, cadavers, and, not, its, live, earwig, transportation, hippolyte, lucas, observed, scarlet, acarine, mites, on, european, earwigs, phasmatodea, embioptera, orthoptera, notoptera, dermapteridae, protodiplatyidae, bellodermatidae, semenoviolidae, turanodermatidae, hemimerina, arixeniina, forficulina, the, fossil, record, of, the, dermaptera, starts, in, the, late, triassic, to, early, jurassic, period, about, 208, million, years, ago, in, england, and, australia, and, comprises, about, 70, specimens, in, the, extinct, suborder, archidermaptera, some, of, the, traits, believed, by, neontologists, to, belong, to, modern, earwigs, are, not, found, in, the, earliest, fossils, but, adults, had, five, segmented, tarsi, the, final, segment, of, the, leg, well, developed, ovipositors, veined, tegmina, forewings, and, long, segmented, cerci, in, fact, the, pincers, would, not, have, been, curled, or, used, as, they, are, now, the, theorized, stem, group, of, the, dermaptera, are, the, protelytroptera, which, are, similar, to, modern, blattodea, cockroaches, with, shell, like, forewings, and, the, large, unequal, anal, fan, are, known, from, the, permian, of, north, america, europe, and, australia, no, fossils, from, the, triassic, during, which, dermaptera, would, have, evolved, from, protelytroptera, have, been, found, amongst, the, most, frequently, suggested, order, of, insects, to, be, the, closest, relatives, of, dermaptera, is, notoptera, theorized, by, giles, in, 1963, however, other, arguments, have, been, made, by, other, authors, linking, them, to, phasmatodea, embioptera, plecoptera, and, dictyoptera, a, 2012, mitochondrial, dna, study, suggested, that, this, order, is, the, sister, to, stoneflies, of, the, order, plecoptera, a, 2018, phylogenetic, analysis, found, that, their, closest, living, relatives, were, angel, insects, of, the, order, zoraptera, with, very, high, support, archidermaptera, is, believed, to, be, sister, to, the, remaining, earwig, groups, the, extinct, eodermaptera, and, the, living, suborder, neodermaptera, former, suborders, forficulina, hemimerina, and, arixeniina, the, extinct, suborders, have, tarsi, with, five, segments, unlike, the, three, found, in, neodermaptera, as, well, as, unsegmented, cerci, no, fossil, hemimeridae, and, arixeniidae, are, known, species, in, hemimeridae, were, at, one, time, in, their, own, order, diploglassata, dermodermaptera, or, hemimerina, like, most, other, epizoic, species, there, is, no, fossil, record, but, they, are, probably, no, older, than, late, tertiary, some, evidence, of, early, evolutionary, history, is, the, structure, of, the, antennal, heart, a, separate, circulatory, organ, consisting, of, two, ampullae, or, vesicles, that, are, attached, to, the, frontal, cuticle, near, the, bases, of, the, antennae, these, features, have, not, been, found, in, other, insects, an, independent, organ, exists, for, each, antenna, consisting, of, an, ampulla, attached, to, the, frontal, cuticle, medial, to, the, antenna, base, and, forming, a, thin, walled, sac, with, a, valved, ostium, on, its, ventral, side, they, pump, blood, by, elastic, connective, tissue, rather, than, muscle, the, characteristics, which, distinguish, the, order, dermaptera, from, other, insect, orders, are, the, overwhelming, majority, of, earwig, species, are, in, the, former, suborder, forficulina, grouped, into, nine, families, of, 180, genera, including, forficula, auricularia, the, common, european, earwig, species, within, forficulina, are, free, living, have, functional, wings, and, are, not, parasites, the, cerci, are, unsegmented, and, modified, into, large, forceps, like, structures, the, first, epizoic, species, of, earwig, was, discovered, by, a, london, taxidermist, on, the, body, of, a, malaysian, hairless, bulldog, bat, in, 1909, then, described, by, karl, jordan, by, the, 1950s, the, two, suborders, arixeniina, and, hemimerina, had, been, added, to, dermaptera, these, were, subsequently, demoted, to, family, arixeniidae, and, superfamily, hemimeroidea, with, sole, family, hemimeridae, respectively, they, are, now, grouped, together, with, the, former, forficulina, in, the, new, suborder, neodermaptera, arixeniidae, represents, two, genera, arixenia, and, xeniaria, with, a, total, of, five, species, in, them, as, with, hemimeridae, they, are, blind, and, wingless, with, filiform, segmented, cerci, hemimeridae, are, viviparous, ectoparasites, preferring, the, fur, of, african, rodents, in, either, cricetomys, or, beamys, genera, hemimerina, also, has, two, genera, hemimerus, and, araeomerus, with, a, total, of, 11, species, dermaptera, is, relatively, small, compared, to, the, other, orders, of, insecta, with, only, about, 2, 000, species, 3, suborders, and, 15, families, including, the, extinct, suborders, archidermaptera, and, eodermaptera, with, their, extinct, families, protodiplatyidae, dermapteridae, semenoviolidae, and, turanodermatidae, the, phylogeny, of, the, dermaptera, is, still, debated, the, extant, dermaptera, appear, to, be, monophyletic, and, there, is, support, for, the, monophyly, of, the, families, forficulidae, chelisochidae, labiduridae, and, anisolabididae, however, evidence, has, supported, the, conclusion, that, the, former, suborder, forficulina, was, paraphyletic, through, the, exclusion, of, hemimerina, and, arixeniina, which, should, instead, be, nested, within, the, forficulina, thus, these, former, suborders, were, eliminated, in, the, most, recent, higher, classification, earwigs, are, fairly, abundant, and, are, found, in, many, areas, around, the, world, there, is, no, evidence, that, they, transmit, diseases, to, humans, or, other, animals, their, pincers, are, commonly, believed, to, be, dangerous, but, in, reality, even, the, curved, pincers, of, males, cause, little, or, no, harm, to, humans, earwigs, have, been, rarely, known, to, crawl, into, the, ears, of, humans, and, they, do, not, lay, eggs, inside, the, human, body, or, human, brain, as, is, often, claimed, there, is, a, debate, whether, earwigs, are, harmful, or, beneficial, to, crops, as, they, eat, both, the, foliage, and, the, insects, eating, such, foliage, such, as, aphids, though, it, would, take, a, large, population, to, do, considerable, damage, the, common, earwig, eats, a, wide, variety, of, plants, and, also, a, wide, variety, of, foliage, including, the, leaves, and, petals, they, have, been, known, to, cause, economic, losses, in, fruit, and, vegetable, crops, some, examples, are, the, flowers, hops, red, raspberries, and, corn, crops, in, germany, and, in, the, south, of, france, earwigs, have, been, observed, feeding, on, peaches, and, apricots, the, earwigs, attacked, mature, plants, and, made, cup, shaped, bite, marks, 3, 11, mm, 1, 8, 7, 16, in, in, diameter
