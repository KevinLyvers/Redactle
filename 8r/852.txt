see, text, the, macaques, m, k, k, k, k, constitute, a, genus, macaca, of, gregarious, old, world, monkeys, of, the, subfamily, cercopithecinae, the, 23, species, of, macaques, inhabit, ranges, throughout, asia, north, africa, and, in, gibraltar, europe, macaques, are, principally, frugivorous, preferring, fruit, although, their, diet, also, includes, seeds, leaves, flowers, and, tree, bark, some, species, such, as, the, long, tailed, macaque, m, fascicularis, also, called, the, crab, eating, macaque, will, supplement, their, diets, with, small, amounts, of, meat, from, shellfish, insects, and, small, mammals, on, average, a, southern, pig, tailed, macaque, m, nemestrina, in, malaysia, eats, about, 70, large, rats, each, year, all, macaque, social, groups, are, arranged, around, dominant, matriarchs, macaques, are, found, in, a, variety, of, habitats, throughout, the, asian, continent, and, are, highly, adaptable, certain, species, are, synanthropic, having, learned, to, live, alongside, humans, but, they, have, become, problematic, in, urban, areas, in, southeast, asia, and, are, not, suitable, to, live, with, as, they, can, carry, transmittable, diseases, most, macaque, species, are, listed, as, vulnerable, to, critically, endangered, on, the, international, union, of, the, conservation, of, nature, iucn, red, list, aside, from, humans, genus, homo, the, macaques, are, the, most, widespread, primate, genus, ranging, from, japan, to, the, indian, subcontinent, and, in, the, case, of, the, barbary, macaque, macaca, sylvanus, to, north, africa, and, southern, europe, twenty, three, macaque, species, are, currently, recognized, macaques, are, robust, primates, whose, arms, and, legs, are, about, the, same, in, length, the, fur, of, these, animals, is, typically, varying, shades, of, brown, or, black, and, their, muzzles, are, rounded, in, profile, with, nostrils, on, the, upper, surface, the, tail, varies, among, each, species, which, can, be, long, moderate, short, or, totally, absent, although, several, species, lack, tails, and, their, common, names, refer, to, them, as, apes, these, are, true, monkeys, with, no, greater, relationship, to, the, true, apes, than, any, other, old, world, monkeys, instead, this, comes, from, an, earlier, definition, of, ape, that, included, primates, generally, in, some, species, skin, folds, join, the, second, through, fifth, toes, almost, reaching, the, first, metatarsal, joint, the, monkey, s, size, differs, depending, on, sex, and, species, males, from, all, species, can, range, from, 41, to, 70, cm, 16, to, 28, inches, in, head, and, body, length, and, in, weight, from, 5, 5, to, 18, kg, 12, 13, to, 39, 7, lb, females, can, range, from, a, weight, of, 2, 4, to, 13, kg, 5, 3, to, 28, 7, lb, these, primates, live, in, troops, that, vary, in, size, where, males, dominate, however, the, order, of, dominance, frequently, shifts, female, dominance, lasts, longer, and, depends, upon, their, genealogical, position, macaques, are, able, to, swim, and, spend, most, of, their, time, on, the, ground, and, spend, some, time, in, trees, they, have, large, pouches, in, their, cheeks, where, they, carry, extra, food, they, are, considered, highly, intelligent, and, are, often, used, in, the, medical, field, for, experimentation, due, to, their, remarkable, similarity, to, humans, in, emotional, and, cognitive, development, extensive, experimentation, has, led, to, the, long, tailed, macaque, being, listed, as, endangered, macaques, are, highly, adaptable, to, different, habitats, and, climates, and, can, tolerate, a, wide, fluctuation, of, temperatures, and, live, in, varying, landscape, settings, they, easily, adapt, to, human, built, environments, and, can, survive, well, in, urban, settings, if, they, are, able, to, obtain, food, they, can, also, survive, in, completely, natural, settings, absent, of, humans, the, ecological, and, geographic, ranges, of, the, macaque, are, the, widest, of, any, non, human, primate, their, habitats, include, the, tropical, rainforests, of, southeast, asia, sri, lanka, india, arid, mountains, of, pakistan, and, afghanistan, and, temperate, mountains, in, algeria, japan, china, morocco, and, nepal, some, species, also, inhabit, villages, and, towns, in, cities, in, asia, there, is, also, an, introduced, population, of, rhesus, macaques, in, the, us, state, of, florida, consisting, essentially, of, monkeys, abandoned, when, a, failed, boat, ride, safari, was, shut, down, in, the, mid, 20th, century, a, probable, early, pliocene, macaque, molar, from, the, red, crag, formation, waldringfield, united, kingdom, represents, one, of, the, oldest, and, northernmost, records, of, the, genus, in, europe, reported, to, date, macaques, are, mainly, frugivorous, although, some, species, have, been, observed, feeding, on, insects, in, natural, habitats, they, have, been, observed, to, consume, certain, parts, of, over, one, hundred, species, of, plants, including, the, buds, fruit, young, leaves, bark, roots, and, flowers, when, macaques, live, amongst, people, they, raid, agricultural, crops, such, as, wheat, rice, or, sugarcane, and, garden, crops, like, tomatoes, bananas, melons, mangos, or, papayas, in, human, settings, they, also, rely, heavily, on, direct, handouts, from, people, this, includes, peanuts, rice, legumes, or, even, prepared, food, macaques, live, in, established, social, groups, that, can, range, from, a, few, individuals, to, several, hundred, as, they, are, social, animals, a, typical, social, group, possess, between, 20, and, 50, individuals, of, all, ages, and, of, both, sexes, the, typical, composition, consists, of, 15, adult, males, 35, adult, females, 20, infants, and, 30, juveniles, though, there, exists, variation, in, structure, and, size, of, groups, across, populations, macaques, have, a, very, intricate, social, structure, and, hierarchy, with, different, classifications, of, despotism, depending, on, species, if, a, macaque, of, a, lower, level, in, the, social, chain, has, eaten, berries, and, none, are, left, for, a, higher, ranking, macaque, then, the, one, higher, in, status, can, within, this, social, organization, remove, the, berries, from, the, other, monkey, s, mouth, the, reproductive, potential, of, each, species, differs, populations, of, the, rhesus, macaque, can, grow, at, rates, of, 10, to, 15, per, year, if, the, environmental, conditions, are, favorable, however, some, forest, dwelling, species, are, endangered, with, much, lower, reproductive, rates, after, one, year, of, age, macaques, move, from, being, dependent, on, their, mother, during, infancy, to, the, juvenile, stage, where, they, begin, to, associate, more, with, other, juveniles, through, rough, tumble, and, playing, activities, they, sexually, mature, between, three, and, five, years, of, age, females, will, usually, stay, with, the, social, group, in, which, they, were, born, however, young, adult, males, tend, to, disperse, and, attempt, to, enter, other, social, groups, not, all, males, succeed, in, joining, other, groups, and, may, become, solitary, attempting, to, join, other, social, groups, for, many, years, macaques, have, a, typical, lifespan, of, 20, to, 30, years, certain, species, under, the, genus, macaca, have, become, invasive, in, certain, parts, of, the, world, while, others, that, survive, in, forest, habitats, remain, threatened, the, long, tailed, macaque, m, fascicularis, is, listed, as, a, threat, and, invasive, alien, species, in, mauritius, along, with, the, rhesus, macaques, m, mulatta, in, florida, despite, this, the, former, is, listed, as, endangered, the, long, tailed, macaque, causes, severe, damage, to, parts, of, its, range, where, it, has, been, introduced, because, the, populations, grow, unchecked, due, to, a, lack, of, predators, on, the, island, of, mauritius, they, have, created, serious, conservation, concerns, for, other, endemic, species, they, consume, seeds, of, native, plants, and, aid, in, the, spread, of, exotic, weeds, throughout, the, forests, this, changes, the, composition, of, the, habitats, and, allows, them, to, be, rapidly, overrun, by, invasive, plants, long, tailed, macaques, are, also, responsible, for, the, near, extinction, of, several, bird, species, on, mauritius, by, destroying, the, nests, of, the, birds, as, they, move, through, their, native, ranges, and, eat, the, eggs, of, critically, endangered, species, such, as, the, pink, pigeon, and, mauritian, green, parrot, they, can, be, serious, agricultural, pests, because, they, raid, crops, and, gardens, and, humans, often, shoot, the, monkeys, which, can, eliminate, entire, local, populations, in, florida, a, group, of, rhesus, macaques, inhabit, silver, springs, state, park, humans, often, feed, them, which, may, alter, their, movement, and, keep, them, close, to, the, river, on, weekends, where, high, human, traffic, is, present, the, monkeys, can, become, aggressive, toward, humans, largely, due, to, human, ignorance, of, macaque, behavior, and, also, carry, potentially, fatal, human, diseases, including, the, herpes, b, virus, several, species, of, macaque, are, used, extensively, in, animal, testing, particularly, in, the, neuroscience, of, visual, perception, and, the, visual, system, nearly, all, 73, 100, captive, rhesus, macaques, are, carriers, of, the, herpes, b, virus, this, virus, is, harmless, to, macaques, but, infections, of, humans, while, rare, are, potentially, fatal, a, risk, that, makes, macaques, unsuitable, as, pets, urban, performing, macaques, also, carried, simian, foamy, virus, suggesting, they, could, be, involved, in, the, species, to, species, jump, of, similar, retroviruses, to, humans, management, techniques, have, historically, been, controversial, and, public, disapproval, can, hinder, control, efforts, previously, efforts, to, remove, macaque, individuals, were, met, with, public, resistance, one, management, strategy, that, is, currently, being, explored, is, that, of, sterilization, natural, resource, managers, are, being, educated, by, scientific, studies, in, the, proposed, strategy, effectiveness, of, this, strategy, is, estimated, to, succeed, in, keeping, populations, in, check, for, example, if, 80, of, females, are, sterilized, every, five, years, or, 50, every, two, years, it, could, effectively, reduce, the, population, other, control, strategies, include, planting, specific, trees, to, provide, protection, to, native, birds, from, macaque, predation, live, trapping, and, the, vaccine, porcine, zona, pellucida, pzp, which, causes, infertility, in, females, in, january, 2018, scientists, in, china, reported, in, the, journal, cell, the, first, creation, of, two, crab, eating, macaque, clones, named, zhong, zhong, and, hua, hua, using, somatic,
