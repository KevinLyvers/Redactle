in, vascular, plants, the, roots, are, the, organs, of, a, plant, that, are, modified, to, provide, anchorage, for, the, plant, and, take, in, water, and, nutrients, into, the, plant, body, which, allows, plants, to, grow, taller, and, faster, they, are, most, often, below, the, surface, of, the, soil, but, roots, can, also, be, aerial, or, aerating, that, is, growing, up, above, the, ground, or, especially, above, water, the, major, functions, of, roots, are, absorption, of, water, plant, nutrition, and, anchoring, of, the, plant, body, to, the, ground, root, morphology, is, divided, into, four, zones, the, root, cap, the, apical, meristem, the, elongation, zone, and, the, hair, the, root, cap, of, new, roots, helps, the, root, penetrate, the, soil, these, root, caps, are, sloughed, off, as, the, root, goes, deeper, creating, a, slimy, surface, that, provides, lubrication, the, apical, meristem, behind, the, root, cap, produces, new, root, cells, that, elongate, then, root, hairs, form, that, absorb, water, and, mineral, nutrients, from, the, soil, the, first, root, in, seed, producing, plants, is, the, radicle, which, expands, from, the, plant, embryo, after, seed, germination, when, dissected, the, arrangement, of, the, cells, in, a, root, is, root, hair, epidermis, epiblem, cortex, endodermis, pericycle, and, lastly, the, vascular, tissue, in, the, centre, of, a, root, to, transport, the, water, absorbed, by, the, root, to, other, places, of, the, plant, perhaps, the, most, striking, characteristic, of, roots, that, distinguishes, them, from, other, plant, organs, such, as, stem, branches, and, leaves, is, that, roots, have, an, endogenous, origin, i, e, they, originate, and, develop, from, an, inner, layer, of, the, mother, axis, such, as, pericycle, in, contrast, stem, branches, and, leaves, are, exogenous, i, e, they, start, to, develop, from, the, cortex, an, outer, layer, in, response, to, the, concentration, of, nutrients, roots, also, synthesise, cytokinin, which, acts, as, a, signal, as, to, how, fast, the, shoots, can, grow, roots, often, function, in, storage, of, food, and, nutrients, the, roots, of, most, vascular, plant, species, enter, into, symbiosis, with, certain, fungi, to, form, mycorrhizae, and, a, large, range, of, other, organisms, including, bacteria, also, closely, associate, with, roots, in, its, simplest, form, the, term, root, system, architecture, rsa, refers, to, the, spatial, configuration, of, a, plant, s, root, system, this, system, can, be, extremely, complex, and, is, dependent, upon, multiple, factors, such, as, the, species, of, the, plant, itself, the, composition, of, the, soil, and, the, availability, of, nutrients, root, architecture, plays, the, important, role, of, providing, a, secure, supply, of, nutrients, and, water, as, well, as, anchorage, and, support, the, configuration, of, root, systems, serves, to, structurally, support, the, plant, compete, with, other, plants, and, for, uptake, of, nutrients, from, the, soil, roots, grow, to, specific, conditions, which, if, changed, can, impede, a, plant, s, growth, for, example, a, root, system, that, has, developed, in, dry, soil, may, not, be, as, efficient, in, flooded, soil, yet, plants, are, able, to, adapt, to, other, changes, in, the, environment, such, as, seasonal, changes, the, main, terms, used, to, classify, the, architecture, of, a, root, system, are, all, components, of, the, root, architecture, are, regulated, through, a, complex, interaction, between, genetic, responses, and, responses, due, to, environmental, stimuli, these, developmental, stimuli, are, categorised, as, intrinsic, the, genetic, and, nutritional, influences, or, extrinsic, the, environmental, influences, and, are, interpreted, by, signal, transduction, pathways, extrinsic, factors, affecting, root, architecture, include, gravity, light, exposure, water, and, oxygen, as, well, as, the, availability, or, lack, of, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, aluminium, and, sodium, chloride, the, main, hormones, intrinsic, stimuli, and, respective, pathways, responsible, for, root, architecture, development, include, early, root, growth, is, one, of, the, functions, of, the, apical, meristem, located, near, the, tip, of, the, root, the, meristem, cells, more, or, less, continuously, divide, producing, more, meristem, root, cap, cells, these, are, sacrificed, to, protect, the, meristem, and, undifferentiated, root, cells, the, latter, become, the, primary, tissues, of, the, root, first, undergoing, elongation, a, process, that, pushes, the, root, tip, forward, in, the, growing, medium, gradually, these, cells, differentiate, and, mature, into, specialized, cells, of, the, root, tissues, growth, from, apical, meristems, is, known, as, primary, growth, which, encompasses, all, elongation, secondary, growth, encompasses, all, growth, in, diameter, a, major, component, of, woody, plant, tissues, and, many, nonwoody, plants, for, example, storage, roots, of, sweet, potato, have, secondary, growth, but, are, not, woody, secondary, growth, occurs, at, the, lateral, meristems, namely, the, vascular, cambium, and, cork, cambium, the, former, forms, secondary, xylem, and, secondary, phloem, while, the, latter, forms, the, periderm, in, plants, with, secondary, growth, the, vascular, cambium, originating, between, the, xylem, and, the, phloem, forms, a, cylinder, of, tissue, along, the, stem, and, root, the, vascular, cambium, forms, new, cells, on, both, the, inside, and, outside, of, the, cambium, cylinder, with, those, on, the, inside, forming, secondary, xylem, cells, and, those, on, the, outside, forming, secondary, phloem, cells, as, secondary, xylem, accumulates, the, girth, lateral, dimensions, of, the, stem, and, root, increases, as, a, result, tissues, beyond, the, secondary, phloem, including, the, epidermis, and, cortex, in, many, cases, tend, to, be, pushed, outward, and, are, eventually, sloughed, off, shed, at, this, point, the, cork, cambium, begins, to, form, the, periderm, consisting, of, protective, cork, cells, the, walls, of, cork, cells, contains, suberin, thickenings, which, is, an, extra, cellular, complex, biopolymer, the, suberin, thickenings, functions, by, providing, a, physical, barrier, protection, against, pathogens, and, by, preventing, water, loss, from, the, surrounding, tissues, in, addition, it, also, aids, the, process, of, wound, healing, in, plants, it, is, also, postulated, that, suberin, could, be, a, component, of, the, apoplastic, barrier, present, at, the, outer, cell, layers, of, roots, which, prevents, toxic, compounds, from, entering, the, root, and, reduces, radial, oxygen, loss, rol, from, the, aerenchyma, during, waterlogging, in, roots, the, cork, cambium, originates, in, the, pericycle, a, component, of, the, vascular, cylinder, the, vascular, cambium, produces, new, layers, of, secondary, xylem, annually, the, xylem, vessels, are, dead, at, maturity, in, some, but, are, responsible, for, most, water, transport, through, the, vascular, tissue, in, stems, and, roots, tree, roots, usually, grow, to, three, times, the, diameter, of, the, branch, spread, only, half, of, which, lie, underneath, the, trunk, and, canopy, the, roots, from, one, side, of, a, tree, usually, supply, nutrients, to, the, foliage, on, the, same, side, some, families, however, such, as, sapindaceae, the, maple, family, show, no, correlation, between, root, location, and, where, the, root, supplies, nutrients, on, the, plant, there, is, a, correlation, of, roots, using, the, process, of, plant, perception, to, sense, their, physical, environment, to, grow, including, the, sensing, of, light, and, physical, barriers, plants, also, sense, gravity, and, respond, through, auxin, pathways, resulting, in, gravitropism, over, time, roots, can, crack, foundations, snap, water, lines, and, lift, sidewalks, research, has, shown, that, roots, have, ability, to, recognize, self, and, non, self, roots, in, same, soil, environment, the, correct, environment, of, air, mineral, nutrients, and, water, directs, plant, roots, to, grow, in, any, direction, to, meet, the, plant, s, needs, roots, will, shy, or, shrink, away, from, dry, or, other, poor, soil, conditions, gravitropism, directs, roots, to, grow, downward, at, germination, the, growth, mechanism, of, plants, that, also, causes, the, shoot, to, grow, upward, different, types, of, roots, such, as, primary, seminal, lateral, and, crown, are, maintained, at, different, gravitropic, setpoint, angles, i, e, the, direction, in, which, they, grow, recent, research, show, that, root, angle, in, cereal, crops, such, as, barley, and, wheat, is, regulated, by, a, novel, gene, called, enhanced, gravitropism, 1, egt1, research, indicates, that, plant, roots, growing, in, search, of, productive, nutrition, can, sense, and, avoid, soil, compaction, through, diffusion, of, the, gas, ethylene, in, order, to, avoid, shade, plants, utilize, a, shade, avoidance, response, when, a, plant, is, under, dense, vegetation, the, presence, of, other, vegetation, nearby, will, cause, the, plant, to, avoid, lateral, growth, and, experience, an, increase, in, upward, shoot, as, well, as, downward, root, growth, in, order, to, escape, shade, plants, adjust, their, root, architecture, most, notably, by, decreasing, the, length, and, amount, of, lateral, roots, emerging, from, the, primary, root, experimentation, of, mutant, variants, of, arabidopsis, thaliana, found, that, plants, sense, the, red, to, far, red, light, ratio, that, enters, the, plant, through, photoreceptors, known, as, phytochromes, nearby, plant, leaves, will, absorb, red, light, and, reflect, far, red, light, which, will, cause, the, ratio, red, to, far, red, light, to, lower, the, phytochrome, phya, that, senses, this, red, to, far, red, light, ratio, is, localized, in, both, the, root, system, as, well, as, the, shoot, system, of, plants, but, through, knockout, mutant, experimentation, it, was, found, that, root, localized, phya, does, not, sense, the, light, ratio, whether, directly, or, axially, that, leads, to, changes, in, the, lateral, root, architecture, research, instead, found, that, shoot, localized, phya, is, the, phytochrome, responsible, for, causing, these, architectural, changes, of, the, lateral, root, research, has, also, found, that, phytochrome, completes, these, architectural, changes, through, the, manipulation, of, auxin, distribution, in, the, root, of, the, plant, when, a, low, enough, red, to, far, red, ratio, is, sensed, by, phya, the, phya, in, the, shoot, will, be, mostly, in, its, active, form, in, this, form, phya, stabilize, the, transcription, factor, hy5, causing, it, to, no, longer, be, degraded, as, it, is, when, phya, is, in, its, inactive, form, this, stabilized, transcription, factor, is, then, able, to, be, transported, to, the, roots, of, the, plant, through, the, phloem, where, it, proceeds, to, induce, its, own, transcription, as, a, way, to, amplify, its, signal, in, the, roots, of, the, plant, hy5, functions, to, inhibit, an, auxin, response, factor, known, as, arf19, a, response, factor, responsible, for, the, translation, of, pin3, and, lax3, two, well, known, auxin, transporting, proteins, thus, through, manipulation, of, arf19, the, level, and, activity, of, auxin, transporters, pin3, and, lax3, is, inhibited, once, inhibited, auxin, levels, will, be, low, in, areas, where, lateral, root, emergence, normally, occurs, resulting, in, a, failure, for, the, plant, to, have, the, emergence, of, the, lateral, root, primordium, through, the, root, pericycle, with, this, complex, manipulation, of, auxin, transport, in, the, roots, lateral, root, emergence, will, be, inhibited, in, the, roots, and, the, root, will, instead, elongate, downwards, promoting, vertical, plant, growth, in, an, attempt, to, avoid, shade, research, of, arabidopsis, has, led, to, the, discovery, of, how, this, auxin, mediated, root, response, works, in, an, attempt, to, discover, the, role, that, phytochrome, plays, in, lateral, root, development, salisbury, et, al, 2007, worked, with, arabidopsis, thaliana, grown, on, agar, plates, salisbury, et, al, used, wild, type, plants, along, with, varying, protein, knockout, and, gene, knockout, arabidopsis, mutants, to, observe, the, results, these, mutations, had, on, the, root, architecture, protein, presence, and, gene, expression, to, do, this, salisbury, et, al, used, gfp, fluorescence, along, with, other, forms, of, both, macro, and, microscopic, imagery, to, observe, any, changes, various, mutations, caused, from, these, research, salisbury, et, al, were, able, to, theorize, that, shoot, located, phytochromes, alter, auxin, levels, in, roots, controlling, lateral, root, development, and, overall, root, architecture, in, the, experiments, of, van, gelderen, et, al, 2018, they, wanted, to, see, if, and, how, it, is, that, the, shoot, of, a, thaliana, alters, and, affects, root, development, and, root, architecture, to, do, this, they, took, arabidopsis, plants, grew, them, in, agar, gel, and, exposed, the, roots, and, shoots, to, separate, sources, of, light, from, here, they, altered, the, different, wavelengths, of, light, the, shoot, and, root, of, the, plants, were, receiving, and, recorded, the, lateral, root, density, amount, of, lateral, roots, and, the, general, architecture, of, the, lateral, roots, to, identify, the, function, of, specific, photoreceptors, proteins, genes, and, hormones, they, utilized, various, arabidopsis, knockout, mutants, and, observed, the, resulting, changes, in, lateral, roots, architecture, through, their, observations, and, various, experiments, van, gelderen, et, al, were, able, to, develop, a, mechanism, for, how, root, detection, of, red, to, far, red, light, ratios, alter, lateral, root, development, a, true, root, system, consists, of, a, primary, root, and, secondary, roots, or, lateral, roots, the, roots, or, parts, of, roots, of, many, plant, species, have, become, specialized, to, serve, adaptive, purposes, besides, the, two, primary, functions, described, in, the, introduction, the, distribution, of, vascular, plant, roots, within, soil, depends, on, plant, form, the, spatial, and, temporal, availability, of, water, and, nutrients, and, the, physical, properties, of, the, soil, the, deepest, roots, are, generally, found, in, deserts, and, temperate, coniferous, forests, the, shallowest, in, tundra, boreal, forest, and, temperate, grasslands, the, deepest, observed, living, root, at, least, 60, metres, 200, ft, below, the, ground, surface, was, observed, during, the, excavation, of, an, open, pit, mine, in, arizona, us, some, roots, can, grow, as, deep, as, the, tree, is, high, the, majority, of, roots, on, most, plants, are, however, found, relatively, close, to, the, surface, where, nutrient, availability, and, aeration, are, more, favourable, for, growth, rooting, depth, may, be, physically, restricted, by, rock, or, compacted, soil, close, below, the, surface, or, by, anaerobic, soil, conditions, the, fossil, record, of, roots, or, rather, infilled, voids, where, roots, rotted, after, death, spans, back, to, the, late, silurian, about, 430, million, years, ago, their, identification, is, difficult, because, casts, and, molds, of, roots, are, so, similar, in, appearance, to, animal, burrows, they, can, be, discriminated, using, a, range, of, features, the, evolutionary, development, of, roots, likely, happened, from, the, modification, of, shallow, rhizomes, modified, horizontal, stems, which, anchored, primitive, vascular, plants, combined, with, the, development, of, filamentous, outgrowths, called, rhizoids, which, anchored, the, plants, and, conducted, water, to, the, plant, from, the, soil, light, has, been, shown, to, have, some, impact, on, roots, but, its, not, been, studied, as, much, as, the, effect, of, light, on, other, plant, systems, early, research, in, the, 1930s, found, that, light, decreased, the, effectiveness, of, indole, 3, acetic, acid, on, adventitious, root, initiation, studies, of, the, pea, in, the, 1950s, shows, that, lateral, root, formation, was, inhibited, by, light, and, in, the, early, 1960s, researchers, found, that, light, could, induce, positive, gravitropic, responses, in, some, situations, the, effects, of, light, on, root, elongation, has, been, studied, for, monocotyledonous, and, dicotyledonous, plants, with, the, majority, of, studies, finding, that, light, inhibited, root, elongation, whether, pulsed, or, continuous, studies, of, arabidopsis, in, the, 1990s, showed, negative, phototropism, and, inhibition, of, the, elongation, of, root, hairs, in, light, sensed, by, phyb, certain, plants, namely, fabaceae, form, root, nodules, in, order, to, associate, and, form, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, nitrogen, fixing, bacteria, called, rhizobia, owing, to, the, high, energy, required, to, fix, nitrogen, from, the, atmosphere, the, bacteria, take, carbon, compounds, from, the, plant, to, fuel, the, process, in, return, the, plant, takes, nitrogen, compounds, produced, from, ammonia, by, the, bacteria, soil, temperature, is, a, factor, that, effects, root, initiation, and, length, root, length, is, usually, impacted, more, dramatically, by, temperature, than, overall, mass, where, cooler, temperatures, tend, to, cause, more, lateral, growth, because, downward, extension, is, limited, by, cooler, temperatures, at, subsoil, levels, needs, vary, by, plant, species, but, in, temperate, regions, cool, temperatures, may, limit, root, systems, cool, temperature, species, like, oats, rapeseed, rye, wheat, fare, better, in, lower, temperatures, than, summer, annuals, like, maize, and, cotton, researchers, have, found, that, plants, like, cotton, develop, wider, and, shorter, taproots, in, cooler, temperatures, the, first, root, originating, from, the, seed, usually, has, a, wider, diameter, than, root, branches, so, smaller, root, diameters, are, expected, if, temperatures, increase, root, initiation, root, diameter, also, decreases, when, the, root, elongates, plants, can, interact, with, one, another, in, their, environment, through, their, root, systems, studies, have, demonstrated, that, plant, plant, interaction, occurs, among, root, systems, via, the, soil, as, a, medium, researchers, have, tested, whether, plants, growing, in, ambient, conditions, would, change, their, behavior, if, a, nearby, plant, was, exposed, to, drought, conditions, since, nearby, plants, showed, no, changes, in, stomatal, aperture, researchers, believe, the, drought, signal, spread, through, the, roots, and, soil, not, through, the, air, as, a, volatile, chemical, signal, soil, microbiota, can, suppress, both, disease, and, beneficial, root, symbionts, mycorrhizal, fungi, are, easier, to, establish, in, sterile, soil, inoculation, with, soil, bacteria, can, increase, internode, extension, yield, and, quicken, flowering, the, migration, of, bacteria, along, the, root, varies, with, natural, soil, conditions, for, example, research, has, found, that, the, root, systems, of, wheat, seeds, inoculated, with, azotobacter, showed, higher, populations, in, soils, favorable, to, azotobacter, growth, some, studies, have, been, unsuccessful, in, increasing, the, levels, of, certain, microbes, such, as, p, fluorescens, in, natural, soil, without, prior, sterilization, grass, root, systems, are, beneficial, at, reducing, soil, erosion, by, holding, the, soil, together, perennial, grasses, that, grow, wild, in, rangelands, contribute, organic, matter, to, the, soil, when, their, old, roots, decay, after, attacks, by, beneficial, fungi, protozoa, bacteria, insects, and, worms, release, nutrients, scientists, have, observed, significant, diversity, of, the, microbial, cover, of, roots, at, around, 10, percent, of, three, week, old, root, segments, covered, on, younger, roots, there, was, even, low, coverage, but, even, on, 3, month, old, roots, the, coverage, was, only, around, 37, before, the, 1970s, scientists, believed, that, the, majority, of, the, root, surface, was, covered, by, microorganisms, researchers, studying, maize, seedlings, found, that, calcium, absorption, was, greatest, in, the, apical, root, segment, and, potassium, at, the, base, of, the, root, along, other, root, segments, absorption, was, similar, absorbed, potassium, is, transported, to, the, root, tip, and, to, a, lesser, extent, other, parts, of, the, root, then, also, to, the, shoot, and, grain, calcium, transport, from, the, apical, segment, is, slower, mostly, transported, upward, and, accumulated, in, stem, and, shoot, researchers, found, that, partial, deficiencies, of, k, or, p, did, not, change, the, fatty, acid, composition, of, phosphatidyl, choline, in, brassica, napus, l, plants, calcium, deficiency, did, on, the, other, hand, lead, to, a, marked, decline, of, polyunsaturated, compounds, that, would, be, expected, to, have, negative, impacts, for, integrity, of, the, plant, membrane, that, could, effect, some, properties, like, its, permeability, and, is, needed, for, the, ion, uptake, activity, of, the, root, membranes, the, term, root, crops, refers, to, any, edible, underground, plant, structure, but, many, root, crops, are, actually, stems, such, as, potato, tubers, edible, roots, include, cassava, sweet, potato, beet, carrot, rutabaga, turnip, parsnip, radish, yam, and, horseradish, spices, obtained, from, roots, include, sassafras, angelica, sarsaparilla, and, licorice, sugar, beet, is, an, important, source, of, sugar, yam, roots, are, a, source, of, estrogen, compounds, used, in, birth, control, pills, the, fish, poison, and, insecticide, rotenone, is, obtained, from, roots, of, lonchocarpus, spp, important, medicines, from, roots, are, ginseng, aconite, ipecac, gentian, and, reserpine, several, legumes, that, have, nitrogen, fixing, root, nodules, are, used, as, green, manure, crops, which, provide, nitrogen, fertilizer, for, other, crops, when, plowed, under, specialized, bald, cypress, roots, termed, knees, are, sold, as, souvenirs, lamp, bases, and, carved, into, folk, art, native, americans, used, the, flexible, roots, of, white, spruce, for, basketry, tree, roots, can, heave, and, destroy, concrete, sidewalks, and, crush, or, clog, buried, pipes, the, aerial, roots, of, strangler, fig, have, damaged, ancient, mayan, temples, in, central, america, and, the, temple, of, angkor, wat, in, cambodia, trees, stabilize, soil, on, a, slope, prone, to, landslides, the, root, hairs, work, as, an, anchor, on, the, soil, vegetative, propagation, of, plants, via, cuttings, depends, on, adventitious, root, formation, hundreds, of, millions, of, plants, are, propagated, via, cuttings, annually, including, chrysanthemum, poinsettia, carnation, ornamental, shrubs, and, many, houseplants, roots, can, also, protect, the, environment, by, holding, the, soil, to, reduce, soil, erosion, this, is, especially, important, in, areas, such, as, sand, dunes
