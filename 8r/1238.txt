aspirin, also, known, as, acetylsalicylic, acid, asa, is, a, nonsteroidal, anti, inflammatory, drug, nsaid, used, to, reduce, pain, fever, and, or, inflammation, and, as, an, antithrombotic, specific, inflammatory, conditions, which, aspirin, is, used, to, treat, include, kawasaki, disease, pericarditis, and, rheumatic, fever, aspirin, is, also, used, long, term, to, help, prevent, further, heart, attacks, ischaemic, strokes, and, blood, clots, in, people, at, high, risk, for, pain, or, fever, effects, typically, begin, within, 30, minutes, aspirin, works, similarly, to, other, nsaids, but, also, suppresses, the, normal, functioning, of, platelets, one, common, adverse, effect, is, an, upset, stomach, more, significant, side, effects, include, stomach, ulcers, stomach, bleeding, and, worsening, asthma, bleeding, risk, is, greater, among, those, who, are, older, drink, alcohol, take, other, nsaids, or, are, on, other, blood, thinners, aspirin, is, not, recommended, in, the, last, part, of, pregnancy, it, is, not, generally, recommended, in, children, with, infections, because, of, the, risk, of, reye, syndrome, high, doses, may, result, in, ringing, in, the, ears, a, precursor, to, aspirin, found, in, the, bark, of, the, willow, tree, genus, salix, has, been, used, for, its, health, effects, for, at, least, 2, 400, years, in, 1853, chemist, charles, fr, d, ric, gerhardt, treated, the, medicine, sodium, salicylate, with, acetyl, chloride, to, produce, acetylsalicylic, acid, for, the, first, time, over, the, next, 50, years, other, chemists, mostly, of, the, german, company, bayer, established, the, chemical, structure, and, devised, more, efficient, production, methods, 69, 75, aspirin, is, available, without, medical, prescription, as, a, proprietary, or, generic, medication, in, most, jurisdictions, it, is, one, of, the, most, widely, used, medications, globally, with, an, estimated, 40, 000, tonnes, 44, 000, tons, 50, to, 120, billion, pills, consumed, each, year, and, is, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, in, 2022, it, was, the, 36th, most, commonly, prescribed, medication, in, the, united, states, with, more, than, 16, million, prescriptions, in, 1897, scientists, at, the, bayer, company, began, studying, acetylsalicylic, acid, as, a, less, irritating, replacement, medication, for, common, salicylate, medicines, 69, 75, by, 1899, bayer, had, named, it, aspirin, and, was, selling, it, around, the, world, aspirin, s, popularity, grew, over, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, leading, to, competition, between, many, brands, and, formulations, the, word, aspirin, was, bayer, s, brand, name, however, their, rights, to, the, trademark, were, lost, or, sold, in, many, countries, the, name, is, ultimately, a, blend, of, the, prefix, a, cetyl, spir, spiraea, the, meadowsweet, plant, genus, from, which, the, acetylsalicylic, acid, was, originally, derived, at, bayer, in, the, common, chemical, suffix, aspirin, decomposes, rapidly, in, solutions, of, ammonium, acetate, or, the, acetates, carbonates, citrates, or, hydroxides, of, the, alkali, metals, it, is, stable, in, dry, air, but, gradually, hydrolyses, in, contact, with, moisture, to, acetic, and, salicylic, acids, in, solution, with, alkalis, the, hydrolysis, proceeds, rapidly, and, the, clear, solutions, formed, may, consist, entirely, of, acetate, and, salicylate, like, flour, mills, factories, producing, aspirin, tablets, must, control, the, amount, of, the, powder, that, becomes, airborne, inside, the, building, because, the, powder, air, mixture, can, be, explosive, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, in, the, united, states, of, 5, mg, m, 3, time, weighted, average, in, 1989, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, set, a, legal, permissible, exposure, limit, for, aspirin, of, 5, mg, m, 3, but, this, was, vacated, by, the, afl, cio, v, osha, decision, in, 1993, the, synthesis, of, aspirin, is, classified, as, an, esterification, reaction, salicylic, acid, is, treated, with, acetic, anhydride, an, acid, derivative, causing, a, chemical, reaction, that, turns, salicylic, acid, s, hydroxyl, group, into, an, ester, group, r, oh, r, ococh, 3, this, process, yields, aspirin, and, acetic, acid, which, is, considered, a, byproduct, of, this, reaction, small, amounts, of, sulfuric, acid, and, occasionally, phosphoric, acid, are, almost, always, used, as, a, catalyst, this, method, is, commonly, demonstrated, in, undergraduate, teaching, labs, reaction, between, acetic, acid, and, salicylic, acid, can, also, form, aspirin, but, this, esterification, reaction, is, reversible, and, the, presence, of, water, can, lead, to, hydrolysis, of, the, aspirin, so, an, anhydrous, reagent, is, preferred, formulations, containing, high, concentrations, of, aspirin, often, smell, like, vinegar, because, aspirin, can, decompose, through, hydrolysis, in, moist, conditions, yielding, salicylic, and, acetic, acids, aspirin, an, acetyl, derivative, of, salicylic, acid, is, a, white, crystalline, weakly, acidic, substance, which, melts, at, 136, c, 277, f, and, decomposes, around, 140, c, 284, f, its, acid, dissociation, constant, p, k, a, is, 3, 5, at, 25, c, 77, f, polymorphism, or, the, ability, of, a, substance, to, form, more, than, one, crystal, structure, is, important, in, the, development, of, pharmaceutical, ingredients, many, drugs, receive, regulatory, approval, for, only, a, single, crystal, form, or, polymorph, there, was, only, one, proven, polymorph, form, i, of, aspirin, though, the, existence, of, another, polymorph, was, debated, since, the, 1960s, and, one, report, from, 1981, reported, that, when, crystallized, in, the, presence, of, aspirin, anhydride, the, diffractogram, of, aspirin, has, weak, additional, peaks, though, at, the, time, it, was, dismissed, as, mere, impurity, it, was, in, retrospect, form, ii, aspirin, form, ii, was, reported, in, 2005, found, after, attempted, co, crystallization, of, aspirin, and, levetiracetam, from, hot, acetonitrile, in, form, i, pairs, of, aspirin, molecules, form, centrosymmetric, dimers, through, the, acetyl, groups, with, the, acidic, methyl, proton, to, carbonyl, hydrogen, bonds, in, form, ii, each, aspirin, molecule, forms, the, same, hydrogen, bonds, but, with, two, neighbouring, molecules, instead, of, one, with, respect, to, the, hydrogen, bonds, formed, by, the, carboxylic, acid, groups, both, polymorphs, form, identical, dimer, structures, the, aspirin, polymorphs, contain, identical, 2, dimensional, sections, and, are, therefore, more, precisely, described, as, polytypes, pure, form, ii, aspirin, could, be, prepared, by, seeding, the, batch, with, aspirin, anhydrate, in, 15, weight, in, 1971, british, pharmacologist, john, robert, vane, then, employed, by, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, in, london, showed, aspirin, suppressed, the, production, of, prostaglandins, and, thromboxanes, for, this, discovery, he, was, awarded, the, 1982, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, jointly, with, sune, bergstr, m, and, bengt, ingemar, samuelsson, aspirin, s, ability, to, suppress, the, production, of, prostaglandins, and, thromboxanes, is, due, to, its, irreversible, inactivation, of, the, cyclooxygenase, cox, officially, known, as, prostaglandin, endoperoxide, synthase, ptgs, enzyme, required, for, prostaglandin, and, thromboxane, synthesis, aspirin, acts, as, an, acetylating, agent, where, an, acetyl, group, is, covalently, attached, to, a, serine, residue, in, the, active, site, of, the, cox, enzyme, suicide, inhibition, this, makes, aspirin, different, from, other, nsaids, such, as, diclofenac, and, ibuprofen, which, are, reversible, inhibitors, low, dose, aspirin, use, irreversibly, blocks, the, formation, of, thromboxane, a, 2, in, platelets, producing, an, inhibitory, effect, on, platelet, aggregation, during, the, lifetime, of, the, affected, platelet, 8, 9, days, this, antithrombotic, property, makes, aspirin, useful, for, reducing, the, incidence, of, heart, attacks, in, people, who, have, had, a, heart, attack, unstable, angina, ischemic, stroke, or, transient, ischemic, attack, 40, mg, of, aspirin, a, day, is, able, to, inhibit, a, large, proportion, of, maximum, thromboxane, a, 2, release, provoked, acutely, with, the, prostaglandin, i, 2, synthesis, being, little, affected, however, higher, doses, of, aspirin, are, required, to, attain, further, inhibition, prostaglandins, local, hormones, produced, in, the, body, have, diverse, effects, including, the, transmission, of, pain, information, to, the, brain, modulation, of, the, hypothalamic, thermostat, and, inflammation, thromboxanes, are, responsible, for, the, aggregation, of, platelets, that, form, blood, clots, heart, attacks, are, caused, primarily, by, blood, clots, and, low, doses, of, aspirin, are, seen, as, an, effective, medical, intervention, to, prevent, a, second, acute, myocardial, infarction, at, least, two, different, types, of, cyclooxygenases, cox, 1, and, cox, 2, are, acted, on, by, aspirin, aspirin, irreversibly, inhibits, cox, 1, and, modifies, the, enzymatic, activity, of, cox, 2, cox, 2, normally, produces, prostanoids, most, of, which, are, proinflammatory, aspirin, modified, cox, 2, aka, prostaglandin, endoperoxide, synthase, 2, or, ptgs2, produces, lipoxins, most, of, which, are, anti, inflammatory, newer, nsaid, drugs, cox, 2, inhibitors, coxibs, have, been, developed, to, inhibit, only, cox, 2, with, the, intent, to, reduce, the, incidence, of, gastrointestinal, side, effects, several, cox, 2, inhibitors, such, as, rofecoxib, vioxx, have, been, withdrawn, from, the, market, after, evidence, emerged, that, cox, 2, inhibitors, increase, the, risk, of, heart, attack, and, stroke, endothelial, cells, lining, the, microvasculature, in, the, body, are, proposed, to, express, cox, 2, and, by, selectively, inhibiting, cox, 2, prostaglandin, production, specifically, pgi, 2, prostacyclin, is, downregulated, with, respect, to, thromboxane, levels, as, cox, 1, in, platelets, is, unaffected, thus, the, protective, anticoagulative, effect, of, pgi, 2, is, removed, increasing, the, risk, of, thrombus, and, associated, heart, attacks, and, other, circulatory, problems, since, platelets, have, no, dna, they, are, unable, to, synthesize, new, cox, once, aspirin, has, irreversibly, inhibited, the, enzyme, an, important, difference, as, compared, with, reversible, inhibitors, furthermore, aspirin, while, inhibiting, the, ability, of, cox, 2, to, form, pro, inflammatory, products, such, as, the, prostaglandins, converts, this, enzyme, s, activity, from, a, prostaglandin, forming, cyclooxygenase, to, a, lipoxygenase, like, enzyme, aspirin, treated, cox, 2, metabolizes, a, variety, of, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, to, hydroperoxy, products, which, are, then, further, metabolized, to, specialized, proresolving, mediators, such, as, the, aspirin, triggered, lipoxins, aspirin, triggered, resolvins, and, aspirin, triggered, maresins, these, mediators, possess, potent, anti, inflammatory, activity, it, is, proposed, that, this, aspirin, triggered, transition, of, cox, 2, from, cyclooxygenase, to, lipoxygenase, activity, and, the, consequential, formation, of, specialized, proresolving, mediators, contributes, to, the, anti, inflammatory, effects, of, aspirin, aspirin, has, been, shown, to, have, at, least, three, additional, modes, of, action, it, uncouples, oxidative, phosphorylation, in, cartilaginous, and, hepatic, mitochondria, by, diffusing, from, the, inner, membrane, space, as, a, proton, carrier, back, into, the, mitochondrial, matrix, where, it, ionizes, once, again, to, release, protons, aspirin, buffers, and, transports, the, protons, when, high, doses, are, given, it, may, actually, cause, fever, owing, to, the, heat, released, from, the, electron, transport, chain, as, opposed, to, the, antipyretic, action, of, aspirin, seen, with, lower, doses, in, addition, aspirin, induces, the, formation, of, no, radicals, in, the, body, which, have, been, shown, in, mice, to, have, an, independent, mechanism, of, reducing, inflammation, this, reduced, leukocyte, adhesion, is, an, important, step, in, the, immune, response, to, infection, however, evidence, is, insufficient, to, show, aspirin, helps, to, fight, infection, more, recent, data, also, suggest, salicylic, acid, and, its, derivatives, modulate, signalling, through, nf, b, nf, b, a, transcription, factor, complex, plays, a, central, role, in, many, biological, processes, including, inflammation, aspirin, is, readily, broken, down, in, the, body, to, salicylic, acid, which, itself, has, anti, inflammatory, antipyretic, and, analgesic, effects, in, 2012, salicylic, acid, was, found, to, activate, amp, activated, protein, kinase, which, has, been, suggested, as, a, possible, explanation, for, some, of, the, effects, of, both, salicylic, acid, and, aspirin, the, acetyl, portion, of, the, aspirin, molecule, has, its, own, targets, acetylation, of, cellular, proteins, is, a, well, established, phenomenon, in, the, regulation, of, protein, function, at, the, post, translational, level, aspirin, is, able, to, acetylate, several, other, targets, in, addition, to, cox, isoenzymes, these, acetylation, reactions, may, explain, many, hitherto, unexplained, effects, of, aspirin, aspirin, is, produced, in, many, formulations, with, some, differences, in, effect, in, particular, aspirin, can, cause, gastrointestinal, bleeding, and, formulations, are, sought, which, deliver, the, benefits, of, aspirin, while, mitigating, harmful, bleeding, formulations, may, be, combined, e, g, buffered, vitamin, c, acetylsalicylic, acid, is, a, weak, acid, and, very, little, of, it, is, ionized, in, the, stomach, after, oral, administration, acetylsalicylic, acid, is, quickly, absorbed, through, the, cell, membrane, in, the, acidic, conditions, of, the, stomach, the, increased, ph, and, larger, surface, area, of, the, small, intestine, causes, aspirin, to, be, absorbed, more, slowly, there, as, more, of, it, is, ionized, owing, to, the, formation, of, concretions, aspirin, is, absorbed, much, more, slowly, during, overdose, and, plasma, concentrations, can, continue, to, rise, for, up, to, 24, hours, after, ingestion, about, 50, 80, of, salicylate, in, the, blood, is, bound, to, human, serum, albumin, while, the, rest, remains, in, the, active, ionized, state, protein, binding, is, concentration, dependent, saturation, of, binding, sites, leads, to, more, free, salicylate, and, increased, toxicity, the, volume, of, distribution, is, 0, 1, 0, 2, l, kg, acidosis, increases, the, volume, of, distribution, because, of, enhancement, of, tissue, penetration, of, salicylates, as, much, as, 80, of, therapeutic, doses, of, salicylic, acid, is, metabolized, in, the, liver, conjugation, with, glycine, forms, salicyluric, acid, and, with, glucuronic, acid, to, form, two, different, glucuronide, esters, the, conjugate, with, the, acetyl, group, intact, is, referred, to, as, the, acyl, glucuronide, the, deacetylated, conjugate, is, the, phenolic, glucuronide, these, metabolic, pathways, have, only, a, limited, capacity, small, amounts, of, salicylic, acid, are, also, hydroxylated, to, gentisic, acid, with, large, salicylate, doses, the, kinetics, switch, from, first, order, to, zero, order, as, metabolic, pathways, become, saturated, and, renal, excretion, becomes, increasingly, important, salicylates, are, excreted, mainly, by, the, kidneys, as, salicyluric, acid, 75, free, salicylic, acid, 10, salicylic, phenol, 10, and, acyl, glucuronides, 5, gentisic, acid, 1, and, 2, 3, dihydroxybenzoic, acid, when, small, doses, less, than, 250, mg, in, an, adult, are, ingested, all, pathways, proceed, by, first, order, kinetics, with, an, elimination, half, life, of, about, 2, 0, h, to, 4, 5, h, when, higher, doses, of, salicylate, are, ingested, more, than, 4, g, the, half, life, becomes, much, longer, 15, h, to, 30, h, because, the, biotransformation, pathways, concerned, with, the, formation, of, salicyluric, acid, and, salicyl, phenolic, glucuronide, become, saturated, renal, excretion, of, salicylic, acid, becomes, increasingly, important, as, the, metabolic, pathways, become, saturated, because, it, is, extremely, sensitive, to, changes, in, urinary, ph, a, 10, to, 20, fold, increase, in, renal, clearance, occurs, when, urine, ph, is, increased, from, 5, to, 8, the, use, of, urinary, alkalinization, exploits, this, particular, aspect, of, salicylate, elimination, it, was, found, that, short, term, aspirin, use, in, therapeutic, doses, might, precipitate, reversible, acute, kidney, injury, when, the, patient, was, ill, with, glomerulonephritis, or, cirrhosis, aspirin, for, some, patients, with, chronic, kidney, disease, and, some, children, with, congestive, heart, failure, was, contraindicated, medicines, made, from, willow, and, other, salicylate, rich, plants, appear, in, clay, tablets, from, ancient, sumer, as, well, as, the, ebers, papyrus, from, ancient, egypt, 8, 13, hippocrates, referred, to, the, use, of, salicylic, tea, to, reduce, fevers, around, 400, bc, and, willow, bark, preparations, were, part, of, the, pharmacopoeia, of, western, medicine, in, classical, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, willow, bark, extract, became, recognized, for, its, specific, effects, on, fever, pain, and, inflammation, in, the, mid, eighteenth, century, by, the, nineteenth, century, pharmacists, were, experimenting, with, and, prescribing, a, variety, of, chemicals, related, to, salicylic, acid, the, active, component, of, willow, extract, 46, 55, in, 1853, chemist, charles, fr, d, ric, gerhardt, treated, sodium, salicylate, with, acetyl, chloride, to, produce, acetylsalicylic, acid, for, the, first, time, 46, 48, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, other, academic, chemists, established, the, compound, s, chemical, structure, and, devised, more, efficient, methods, of, synthesis, in, 1897, scientists, at, the, drug, and, dye, firm, bayer, began, investigating, acetylsalicylic, acid, as, a, less, irritating, replacement, for, standard, common, salicylate, medicines, and, identified, a, new, way, to, synthesize, it, 69, 75, by, 1899, bayer, had, dubbed, this, drug, aspirin, and, was, selling, it, globally, 27, the, word, aspirin, was, bayer, s, brand, name, rather, than, the, generic, name, of, the, drug, however, bayer, s, rights, to, the, trademark, were, lost, or, sold, in, many, countries, aspirin, s, popularity, grew, over, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, leading, to, fierce, competition, with, the, proliferation, of, aspirin, brands, and, products, aspirin, s, popularity, declined, after, the, development, of, acetaminophen, paracetamol, in, 1956, and, ibuprofen, in, 1962, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, john, vane, and, others, discovered, the, basic, mechanism, of, aspirin, s, effects, 226, 231, while, clinical, trials, and, other, studies, from, the, 1960s, to, the, 1980s, established, aspirin, s, efficacy, as, an, anti, clotting, agent, that, reduces, the, risk, of, clotting, diseases, 247, 257, the, initial, large, studies, on, the, use, of, low, dose, aspirin, to, prevent, heart, attacks, that, were, published, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, helped, spur, reform, in, clinical, research, ethics, and, guidelines, for, human, subject, research, and, us, federal, law, and, are, often, cited, as, examples, of, clinical, trials, that, included, only, men, but, from, which, people, drew, general, conclusions, that, did, not, hold, true, for, women, aspirin, sales, revived, considerably, in, the, last, decades, of, the, 20th, century, and, remain, strong, in, the, 21st, century, with, widespread, use, as, a, preventive, treatment, for, heart, attacks, and, strokes, 267, 269, bayer, lost, its, trademark, for, aspirin, in, the, united, states, and, some, other, countries, in, actions, taken, between, 1918, and, 1921, because, it, had, failed, to, use, the, name, for, its, own, product, correctly, and, had, for, years, allowed, the, use, of, aspirin, by, other, manufacturers, without, defending, the, intellectual, property, rights, today, aspirin, is, a, generic, trademark, in, many, countries, aspirin, with, a, capital, a, remains, a, registered, trademark, of, bayer, in, germany, canada, mexico, and, in, over, 80, other, countries, for, acetylsalicylic, acid, in, all, markets, but, using, different, packaging, and, physical, aspects, for, each, aspirin, is, used, in, the, treatment, of, a, number, of, conditions, including, fever, pain, rheumatic, fever, and, inflammatory, conditions, such, as, rheumatoid, arthritis, pericarditis, and, kawasaki, disease, lower, doses, of, aspirin, have, also, been, shown, to, reduce, the, risk, of, death, from, a, heart, attack, or, the, risk, of, stroke, in, people, who, are, at, high, risk, or, who, have, cardiovascular, disease, but, not, in, elderly, people, who, are, otherwise, healthy, there, is, evidence, that, aspirin, is, effective, at, preventing, colorectal, cancer, though, the, mechanisms, of, this, effect, are, unclear, aspirin, is, an, effective, analgesic, for, acute, pain, although, it, is, generally, considered, inferior, to, ibuprofen, because, aspirin, is, more, likely, to, cause, gastrointestinal, bleeding, aspirin, is, generally, ineffective, for, those, pains, caused, by, muscle, cramps, bloating, gastric, distension, or, acute, skin, irritation, as, with, other, nsaids, combinations, of, aspirin, and, caffeine, provide, slightly, greater, pain, relief, than, aspirin, alone, effervescent, formulations, of, aspirin, relieve, pain, faster, than, aspirin, in, tablets, which, makes, them, useful, for, the, treatment, of, migraines, topical, aspirin, may, be, effective, for, treating, some, types, of, neuropathic, pain, aspirin, either, by, itself, or, in, a, combined, formulation, effectively, treats, certain, types, of, a, headache, but, its, efficacy, may, be, questionable, for, others, secondary, headaches, meaning, those, caused, by, another, disorder, or, trauma, should, be, promptly, treated, by, a, medical, provider, among, primary, headaches, the, international, classification, of, headache, disorders, distinguishes, between, tension, headache, the, most, common, migraine, and, cluster, headache, aspirin, or, other, over, the, counter, analgesics, are, widely, recognized, as, effective, for, the, treatment, of, tension, headaches, aspirin, especially, as, a, component, of, an, aspirin, paracetamol, caffeine, combination, is, considered, a, first, line, therapy, in, the, treatment, of, migraine, and, comparable, to, lower, doses, of, sumatriptan, it, is, most, effective, at, stopping, migraines, when, they, are, first, beginning, like, its, ability, to, control, pain, aspirin, s, ability, to, control, fever, is, due, to, its, action, on, the, prostaglandin, system, through, its, irreversible, inhibition, of, cox, although, aspirin, s, use, as, an, antipyretic, in, adults, is, well, established, many, medical, societies, and, regulatory, agencies, including, the, american, academy, of, family, physicians, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, and, the, food, and, drug, administration, strongly, advise, against, using, aspirin, for, the, treatment, of, fever, in, children, because, of, the, risk, of, reye, s, syndrome, a, rare, but, often, fatal, illness, associated, with, the, use, of, aspirin, or, other, salicylates, in, children, during, episodes, of, viral, or, bacterial, infection, because, of, the, risk, of, reye, s, syndrome, in, children, in, 1986, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, required, labeling, on, all, aspirin, containing, medications, advising, against, its, use, in, children, and, teenagers, aspirin, is, used, as, an, anti, inflammatory, agent, for, both, acute, and, long, term, inflammation, as, well, as, for, the, treatment, of, inflammatory, diseases, such, as, rheumatoid, arthritis, aspirin, is, an, important, part, of, the, treatment, of, those, who, have, had, a, heart, attack, it, is, generally, not, recommended, for, routine, use, by, people, with, no, other, health, problems, including, those, over, the, age, of, 70, the, 2009, antithrombotic, trialists, collaboration, published, in, lancet, evaluated, the, efficacy, and, safety, of, low, dose, aspirin, in, secondary, prevention, in, those, with, prior, ischaemic, stroke, or, acute, myocardial, infarction, daily, low, dose, aspirin, was, associated, with, a, 19, relative, risk, reduction, of, serious, cardiovascular, events, non, fatal, myocardial, infarction, non, fatal, stroke, or, vascular, death, this, did, come, at, the, expense, of, a, 0, 19, absolute, risk, increase, in, gastrointestinal, bleeding, however, the, benefits, outweigh, the, hazard, risk, in, this, case, data, from, previous, trials, have, suggested, that, weight, based, dosing, of, aspirin, has, greater, benefits, in, primary, prevention, of, cardiovascular, outcomes, however, more, recent, trials, were, not, able, to, replicate, similar, outcomes, using, low, dose, aspirin, in, low, body, weight, 70, kg, in, specific, subset, of, population, studied, i, e, elderly, and, diabetic, population, and, more, evidence, is, required, to, study, the, effect, of, high, dose, aspirin, in, high, body, weight, 70, kg, after, percutaneous, coronary, interventions, pcis, such, as, the, placement, of, a, coronary, artery, stent, a, u, s, agency, for, healthcare, research, and, quality, guideline, recommends, that, aspirin, be, taken, indefinitely, frequently, aspirin, is, combined, with, an, adp, receptor, inhibitor, such, as, clopidogrel, prasugrel, or, ticagrelor, to, prevent, blood, clots, this, is, called, dual, antiplatelet, therapy, dapt, duration, of, dapt, was, advised, in, the, united, states, and, european, union, guidelines, after, the, cure, and, prodigy, studies, in, 2020, the, systematic, review, and, network, meta, analysis, from, khan, et, al, showed, promising, benefits, of, short, term, 6, months, dapt, followed, by, p2y12, inhibitors, in, selected, patients, as, well, as, the, benefits, of, extended, term, 12, months, dapt, in, high, risk, patients, in, conclusion, the, optimal, duration, of, dapt, after, pcis, should, be, personalized, after, outweighing, each, patient, s, risks, of, ischemic, events, and, risks, of, bleeding, events, with, consideration, of, multiple, patient, related, and, procedure, related, factors, moreover, aspirin, should, be, continued, indefinitely, after, dapt, is, complete, the, status, of, the, use, of, aspirin, for, the, primary, prevention, in, cardiovascular, disease, is, conflicting, and, inconsistent, with, recent, changes, from, previously, recommending, it, widely, decades, ago, and, that, some, referenced, newer, trials, in, clinical, guidelines, show, less, of, benefit, of, adding, aspirin, alongside, other, anti, hypertensive, and, cholesterol, lowering, therapies, the, ascend, study, demonstrated, that, in, high, bleeding, risk, diabetics, with, no, prior, cardiovascular, disease, there, is, no, overall, clinical, benefit, 12, decrease, in, risk, of, ischaemic, events, v, s, 29, increase, in, gi, bleeding, of, low, dose, aspirin, in, preventing, the, serious, vascular, events, over, a, period, of, 7, 4, years, similarly, the, results, of, the, arrive, study, also, showed, no, benefit, of, same, dose, of, aspirin, in, reducing, the, time, to, first, cardiovascular, outcome, in, patients, with, moderate, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, over, a, period, of, five, years, aspirin, has, also, been, suggested, as, a, component, of, a, polypill, for, prevention, of, cardiovascular, disease, complicating, the, use, of, aspirin, for, prevention, is, the, phenomenon, of, aspirin, resistance, for, people, who, are, resistant, aspirin, s, efficacy, is, reduced, some, authors, have, suggested, testing, regimens, to, identify, people, who, are, resistant, to, aspirin, as, of, april, 2022, the, united, states, preventive, services, task, force, uspstf, determined, that, there, was, a, small, net, benefit, for, patients, aged, 40, 59, with, a, 10, or, greater, 10, year, cardiovascular, disease, cvd, risk, and, no, net, benefit, for, patients, aged, over, 60, determining, the, net, benefit, was, based, on, balancing, the, risk, reduction, of, taking, aspirin, for, heart, attacks, and, ischaemic, strokes, with, the, increased, risk, of, gastrointestinal, bleeding, intracranial, bleeding, and, hemorrhagic, strokes, their, recommendations, state, that, age, changes, the, risk, of, the, medicine, with, the, magnitude, of, the, benefit, of, aspirin, coming, from, starting, at, a, younger, age, while, the, risk, of, bleeding, while, small, increases, with, age, particular, for, adults, over, 60, and, can, be, compounded, by, other, risk, factors, such, as, diabetes, and, a, history, of, gastrointestinal, bleeding, as, a, result, the, uspstf, suggests, that, people, ages, 40, to, 59, who, are, at, higher, risk, for, cvd, should, decide, with, their, clinician, whether, to, start, taking, aspirin, people, 60, or, older, should, not, start, taking, aspirin, to, prevent, a, first, heart, attack, or, stroke, primary, prevention, guidelines, from, september, 2019, made, by, the, american, college, of, cardiology, and, the, american, heart, association, state, they, might, consider, aspirin, for, patients, aged, 40, 69, with, a, higher, risk, of, atherosclerotic, cvd, without, an, increased, bleeding, risk, while, stating, they, would, not, recommend, aspirin, for, patients, aged, over, 70, or, adults, of, any, age, with, an, increased, bleeding, risk, they, state, a, cvd, risk, estimation, and, a, risk, discussion, should, be, done, before, starting, on, aspirin, while, stating, aspirin, should, be, used, infrequently, in, the, routine, primary, prevention, of, atherosclerotic, cvd, because, of, lack, of, net, benefit, as, of, august, 2021, the, european, society, of, cardiology, made, similar, recommendations, considering, aspirin, specifically, to, patients, aged, less, than, 70, at, high, or, very, high, cvd, risk, without, any, clear, contraindications, on, a, case, by, case, basis, considering, both, ischemic, risk, and, bleeding, risk, aspirin, may, reduce, the, overall, risk, of, both, getting, cancer, and, dying, from, cancer, there, is, substantial, evidence, for, lowering, the, risk, of, colorectal, cancer, crc, but, aspirin, must, be, taken, for, at, least, 10, 20, years, to, see, this, benefit, it, may, also, slightly, reduce, the, risk, of, endometrial, cancer, and, prostate, cancer, some, conclude, the, benefits, are, greater, than, the, risks, due, to, bleeding, in, those, at, average, risk, others, are, unclear, if, the, benefits, are, greater, than, the, risk, given, this, uncertainty, the, 2007, united, states, preventive, services, task, force, uspstf, guidelines, on, this, topic, recommended, against, the, use, of, aspirin, for, prevention, of, crc, in, people, with, average, risk, nine, years, later, however, the, uspstf, issued, a, grade, b, recommendation, for, the, use, of, low, dose, aspirin, 75, to, 100, mg, day, for, the, primary, prevention, of, cvd, and, crc, in, adults, 50, to, 59, years, of, age, who, have, a, 10, or, greater, 10, year, cvd, risk, are, not, at, increased, risk, for, bleeding, have, a, life, expectancy, of, at, least, 10, years, and, are, willing, to, take, low, dose, aspirin, daily, for, at, least, 10, years, a, meta, analysis, through, 2019, said, that, there, was, an, association, between, taking, aspirin, and, lower, risk, of, cancer, of, the, colorectum, esophagus, and, stomach, in, 2021, the, u, s, preventive, services, task, force, raised, questions, about, the, use, of, aspirin, in, cancer, prevention, it, notes, the, results, of, the, 2018, aspree, aspirin, in, reducing, events, in, the, elderly, trial, in, which, the, risk, of, cancer, related, death, was, higher, in, the, aspirin, treated, group, than, in, the, placebo, group, aspirin, along, with, several, other, agents, with, anti, inflammatory, properties, has, been, repurposed, as, an, add, on, treatment, for, depressive, episodes, in, subjects, with, bipolar, disorder, in, light, of, the, possible, role, of, inflammation, in, the, pathogenesis, of, severe, mental, disorders, a, 2022, systematic, review, concluded, that, aspirin, exposure, reduced, the, risk, of, depression, in, a, pooled, cohort, of, three, studies, hr, 0, 624, 95, ci, 0, 0503, 1, 198, p, 0, 033, however, further, high, quality, longer, duration, double, blind, randomized, controlled, trials, rcts, are, needed, to, determine, whether, aspirin, is, an, effective, add, on, treatment, for, bipolar, depression, thus, notwithstanding, the, biological, rationale, the, clinical, perspectives, of, aspirin, and, anti, inflammatory, agents, in, the, treatment, of, bipolar, depression, remain, uncertain, although, cohort, and, longitudinal, studies, have, shown, low, dose, aspirin, has, a, greater, likelihood, of, reducing, the, incidence, of, dementia, numerous, randomized, controlled, trials, have, not, validated, this, some, researchers, have, speculated, the, anti, inflammatory, effects, of, aspirin, may, be, beneficial, for, schizophrenia, small, trials, have, been, conducted, but, evidence, remains, lacking, aspirin, is, a, first, line, treatment, for, the, fever, and, joint, pain, symptoms, of, acute, rheumatic, fever, the, therapy, often, lasts, for, one, to, two, weeks, and, is, rarely, indicated, for, longer, periods, after, fever, and, pain, have, subsided, the, aspirin, is, no, longer, necessary, since, it, does, not, decrease, the, incidence, of, heart, complications, and, residual, rheumatic, heart, disease, naproxen, has, been, shown, to, be, as, effective, as, aspirin, and, less, toxic, but, due, to, the, limited, clinical, experience, naproxen, is, recommended, only, as, a, second, line, treatment, along, with, rheumatic, fever, kawasaki, disease, remains, one, of, the, few, indications, for, aspirin, use, in, children, in, spite, of, a, lack, of, high, quality, evidence, for, its, effectiveness, low, dose, aspirin, supplementation, has, moderate, benefits, when, used, for, prevention, of, pre, eclampsia, this, benefit, is, greater, when, started, in, early, pregnancy, aspirin, has, also, demonstrated, anti, tumoral, effects, via, inhibition, of, the, pttg1, gene, which, is, often, overexpressed, in, tumors, for, some, people, aspirin, does, not, have, as, strong, an, effect, on, platelets, as, for, others, an, effect, known, as, aspirin, resistance, or, insensitivity, one, study, has, suggested, women, are, more, likely, to, be, resistant, than, men, and, a, different, aggregate, study, of, 2, 930, people, found, 28, were, resistant, a, study, in, 100, italian, people, found, of, the, apparent, 31, aspirin, resistant, subjects, only, 5, were, truly, resistant, and, the, others, were, noncompliant, another, study, of, 400, healthy, volunteers, found, no, subjects, who, were, truly, resistant, but, some, had, pseudoresistance, reflecting, delayed, and, reduced, drug, absorption, meta, analysis, and, systematic, reviews, have, concluded, that, laboratory, confirmed, aspirin, resistance, confers, increased, rates, of, poorer, outcomes, in, cardiovascular, and, neurovascular, diseases, although, the, majority, of, research, conducted, has, surrounded, cardiovascular, and, neurovascular, there, is, emerging, research, into, the, risk, of, aspirin, resistance, after, orthopaedic, surgery, where, aspirin, is, used, for, venous, thromboembolism, prophylaxis, aspirin, resistance, in, orthopaedic, surgery, specifically, after, total, hip, and, knee, arthroplasties, is, of, interest, as, risk, factors, for, aspirin, resistance, are, also, risk, factors, for, venous, thromboembolisms, and, osteoarthritis, the, sequelae, of, requiring, a, total, hip, or, knee, arthroplasty, some, of, these, risk, factors, include, obesity, advancing, age, diabetes, mellitus, dyslipidemia, and, inflammatory, diseases, adult, aspirin, tablets, are, produced, in, standardised, sizes, which, vary, slightly, from, country, to, country, for, example, 300, mg, in, britain, and, 325, mg, in, the, united, states, smaller, doses, are, based, on, these, standards, e, g, 75, mg, and, 81, mg, tablets, the, 81, mg, tablets, are, commonly, called, baby, aspirin, or, baby, strength, because, they, were, originally, but, no, longer, intended, to, be, administered, to, infants, and, children, no, medical, significance, occurs, due, to, the, slight, difference, in, dosage, between, the, 75, mg, and, the, 81, mg, tablets, the, dose, required, for, benefit, appears, to, depend, on, a, person, s, weight, for, those, weighing, less, than, 70, kilograms, 154, lb, low, dose, is,

prevention, of, coronary, heart, disease, encourage, men, aged, 45, 79, and, women, aged, 55, 79, to, use, aspirin, when, the, potential, benefit, of, a, reduction, in, mi, for, men, or, stroke, for, women, outweighs, the, potential, harm, of, an, increase, in, gastrointestinal, hemorrhage, the, whi, study, of, postmenopausal, women, found, that, aspirin, resulted, in, a, 25, lower, risk, of, death, from, cardiovascular, disease, and, a, 14, lower, risk, of, death, from, any, cause, though, there, was, no, significant, difference, between, 81, mg, and, 325, mg, aspirin, doses, the, 2021, adaptable, study, also, showed, no, significant, difference, in, cardiovascular, events, or, major, bleeding, between, 81, mg, and, 325, mg, doses, of, aspirin, in, patients, both, men, and, women, with, established, cardiovascular, disease, low, dose, aspirin, use, was, also, associated, with, a, trend, toward, lower, risk, of, cardiovascular, events, and, lower, aspirin, doses, 75, or, 81, mg,

result, in, low, amniotic, fluid, they, recommend, avoiding, nsaids, in, pregnant, women, at, 20, weeks, or, later, in, pregnancy, one, exception, to, the, recommendation, is, the, use, of, low, dose, 81, mg, aspirin, at, any, point, in, pregnancy, under, the, direction, of, a, health, care, professional, aspirin, should, not, be, taken, by, people, who, are, allergic, to, ibuprofen, or, naproxen, or, who, have, salicylate, intolerance, or, a, more, generalized, drug, intolerance, to, nsaids, and, caution, should, be, exercised, in, those, with, asthma, or, nsaid, precipitated, bronchospasm, owing, to, its, effect, on, the, stomach, lining, manufacturers, recommend, people, with, peptic, ulcers, mild, diabetes, or, gastritis, seek, medical, advice, before, using, aspirin, even, if, none, of, these, conditions, is, present, the, risk, of, stomach, bleeding, is, still, increased, when, aspirin, is, taken, with, alcohol, or, warfarin, people, with, hemophilia, or, other, bleeding,

stomach, to, reduce, gastric, harm, but, enteric, coating, does, not, reduce, gastrointestinal, bleeding, risk, enteric, coated, aspirin, may, not, be, as, effective, at, reducing, blood, clot, risk, combining, aspirin, with, other, nsaids, has, been, shown, to, further, increase, the, risk, of, gastrointestinal, bleeding, using, aspirin, in, combination, with, clopidogrel, or, warfarin, also, increases, the, risk, of, upper, gastrointestinal, bleeding, blockade, of, cox, 1, by, aspirin, apparently, results, in, the, upregulation, of, cox, 2, as, part, of, a, gastric, defense, there, is, no, clear, evidence, that, simultaneous, use, of, a, cox, 2, inhibitor, with, aspirin, may, increase, the, risk, of, gastrointestinal, injury, buffering, is, an, additional, method, used, with, the, intent, to, mitigate, gastrointestinal, bleeding, such, as, by, preventing, aspirin, from, concentrating, in, the, walls, of, the, stomach, although, the, benefits, of, buffered, aspirin, are, disputed, almost, any, buffering, agent, used, in, antacids, can, be, used, bufferin, for, example, uses, magnesium, oxide, other, preparations, use, calcium, carbonate, gas, forming, agents, in,

been, investigated, as, a, method, of, protecting, the, stomach, lining, in, trials, vitamin, c, releasing, aspirin, asa, vitc, or, a, buffered, aspirin, formulation, containing, vitamin, c, was, found, to, cause, less, stomach, damage, than, aspirin, alone, it, is, a, widespread, habit, among, eye, specialists, ophthalmologists, to, prescribe, aspirin, as, an, add, on, medication, for, patients, with, retinal, vein, occlusion, rvo, such, as, central, retinal, vein, occlusion, crvo, and, branch, retinal, vein, occlusion, brvo, the, reason, of, this, widespread, use, is, the, evidence, of, its, proven, effectiveness, in, major, systemic, venous, thrombotic, disorders, and, it, has, been, assumed, that, may, be, similarly, beneficial, in, various, types, of, retinal, vein, occlusion, however, a, large, scale, investigation, based, on, data, of, nearly, 700, patients, showed, that, aspirin, or, other, antiplatelet, aggregating, agents, or, anticoagulants, adversely, influence, the, visual, outcome, in, patients, with, crvo, and, hemi, crvo, without, any, evidence, of, protective, or, beneficial, effect, several, expert, groups, including, the, royal, college, of,

recommends, children, who, are, under, 16, years, of, age, should, not, take, aspirin, unless, it, is, on, the, advice, of, a, doctor, for, a, small, number, of, people, taking, aspirin, can, result, in, symptoms, including, hives, swelling, and, headache, aspirin, can, exacerbate, symptoms, among, those, with, chronic, hives, or, create, acute, symptoms, of, hives, these, responses, can, be, due, to, allergic, reactions, to, aspirin, or, more, often, due, to, its, effect, of, inhibiting, the, cox, 1, enzyme, skin, reactions, may, also, tie, to, systemic, contraindications, seen, with, nsaid,

infarction, in, the, first, five, weeks, a, single, daily, dose, of, 324, mg, of, aspirin, for, 12, weeks, has, a, highly, protective, effect, against, acute, myocardial, infarction, and, death, in, men, with, unstable, angina, aspirin, has, been, repurposed, as, an, add, on, treatment, for, depressive, episodes, in, subjects, with, bipolar, disorder, however, meta, analytic, evidence, is, based, on, very, few, studies, and, does, not, suggest, any, efficacy, of, aspirin, in, the, treatment, of, bipolar, depression, thus, notwithstanding, the, biological, rationale, the, clinical, perspectives, of, aspirin, and, anti, inflammatory, agents, in, the, treatment, of, bipolar, depression, remain, uncertain, several, studies, investigated, the, anti, infective, properties, of, aspirin, for, bacterial, viral, and, parasitic, infections, aspirin, was, demonstrated, to, limit, platelet, activation, induced, by, staphylococcus, aureus, and, enterococcus, faecalis, and, to, reduce, streptococcal, adhesion, to, heart, valves, in, patients, with, tuberculous, meningitis, the, addition, of, aspirin, reduced, the, risk, of, new, cerebral, infarction, a, role, of, aspirin, on, bacterial, and, fungal, biofilm, is, also, being, supported, by, growing, evidence, evidence, from, observational, studies, were, conflicting, on, the, effect, of, aspirin, in, breast, cancer, prevention, a, randomized, controlled, trial, showed, that, aspirin, had, no, significant, effect, in, reducing, breast, cancer, thus, further, studies, are, needed, to, clarify, aspirin, effect, in, cancer, prevention, there, are, many, anecdotal, reportings, that, aspirin, can, improve, plant, s, growth, and, resistance, though, most, research, involved, salicylic, acid, instead, of, aspirin, aspirin, is, sometimes, used, in, veterinary, medicine, as, an, anticoagulant, or, to, relieve, pain, associated, with, musculoskeletal, inflammation, or, osteoarthritis, aspirin, should, be, given, to, animals, only, under, the, direct, supervision, of, a, veterinarian, as, adverse, effects, including, gastrointestinal, issues, are, common, an, aspirin, overdose, in, any, species, may, result, in, salicylate, poisoning, characterized, by, hemorrhaging, seizures, coma, and, even, death, dogs, are, better, able, to, tolerate, aspirin, than, cats, are, cats, metabolize, aspirin, slowly, because, they, lack, the, glucuronide, conjugates, that, aid, in, the, excretion, of, aspirin, making, it, potentially, toxic, if, dosing, is, not, spaced, out, properly, no, clinical, signs, of, toxicosis, occurred, when, cats, were, given, 25, mg, kg, of, aspirin, every, 48, hours, for, 4, weeks, but, the, recommended, dose, for, relief, of, pain, and, fever, and, for, treating, blood, clotting, diseases, in, cats, is, 10, mg, kg, every, 48, hours, to, allow, for, metabolization
