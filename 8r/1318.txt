health, risks, and, should, be, tested, for, heavy, metal, contamination, a, 2008, study, of, more, than, 230, products, found, that, approximately, 20, of, remedies, and, 40, of, rasashastra, medicines, purchased, over, the, internet, from, u, s, and, indian, suppliers, contained, lead, mercury, or, arsenic, a, 2015, study, of, users, in, the, united, states, found, elevated, blood, lead,

for, lead, heavy, metals, are, thought, of, as, active, ingredients, by, advocates, of, indian, herbal, medicinal, products, according, to, ancient, ayurvedic, texts, certain, physico, chemical, purification, processes, such, as, samskaras, or, shodhanas, for, metals, detoxify, the, heavy, metals, in, it, these, are, similar, to, the, chinese, pao, zhi, although, the, ayurvedic, techniques, are, more, complex, and, may, involve, physical, pharmacy, techniques, as, well, as, mantras, however, these, products, have, nonetheless, caused, severe, lead, poisoning, and, other, toxic, effects, between, 1978, and, 2008, more, than, 80, cases, of, lead, poisoning, associated, with, ayurvedic, medicine, use, reported, worldwide, in, 2012, the, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, and,

ayurvedic, practitioners, argue, that, the, toxicity, of, bhasmas, ash, products, comes, from, improper, manufacturing, processes, contaminants, improper, use, of, ayurvedic, medicine, quality, of, raw, materials, and, that, the, end, products, and, improper, procedures, are, used, by, charlatans, in, india, the, government, ruled, that, ayurvedic, products, must, be, labelled, with, their, metallic, content, however, in, current, science, a, publication, of, the, indian, academy, of, sciences, m, s, valiathan, said, that, the, absence, of, post, market, surveillance, and, the, paucity, of, test, laboratory, facilities, make, the, quality, control, of, ayurvedic, medicines, exceedingly, difficult, at, this, time, in, the, united, states, most, ayurvedic, products, are, marketed, without, having, been, reviewed, or, approved, by, the, fda, since, 2007, the, fda, has, placed, an, import, alert, on, some, ayurvedic, products, in, order, to, prevent, them, from, entering, the, united, states, a, 2012, toxicological, review, of, mercury, based, traditional, herbo, metallic, preparations, concluded, that, the, long, term, pharmacotherapeutic, and, in, depth, toxicity, studies, of, these, preparations, are, lacking, some, scholars, assert, that, the, concepts, of, traditional, ayurvedic, medicine, have, existed, since, the, times, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, but, since, the, indus, script, has, not, been, deciphered, such, assertions, are, moot, 535, 536, the, atharvaveda, contains, hymns, and, prayers, aimed, at, curing, disease, there, are, various, legendary, accounts, of, the, origin, of, ayurveda, such, as, that, it, was, received, by, dhanvantari, or, divodasa, from, brahma, tradition, also, holds, that, the, writings, of, ayurveda, were, influenced, by, a, lost, text, by, the, sage, agnivesha, ayurveda, is, one, of, the, few, systems, of, medicine, developed, in, ancient, times, that, is, still, widely, practised, in, modern, times, as, such, it, is, open, to, the, criticism, that, its, conceptual, basis, is, obsolete, and, that, its, contemporary, practitioners, have, not, taken, account, of, the, developments, in, medicine, responses, to, this, situation, led, to, an, impassioned, debate, in, india, during, the, early, decades, of, the, twentieth, century, between, proponents, of, unchanging, tradition, uddha, pure, ayurveda, and, those, who, thought, ayurveda, should, modernize, and, syncretize, a, uddha, impure, tainted, ayurveda, the, political, debate, about, the, place, of, ayurveda, in, contemporary, india, has, continued, to, the, present, both, in, the, public, arena, and, in, government, debate, about, the, place, of, ayurvedic, medicine, in, the, contemporary, internationalized, world, also, continues, today, many, ancient, works, on, ayurvedic, medicine, are, lost, to, posterity, but, manuscripts, of, three, principal, early, texts, on, ayurveda, have, survived, to, the, present, day, these, works, are, the, charaka, samhita, the, sushruta, samhita, and, the, bhela, samhita, the, dating, of, these, works, is, historically, complicated, since, they, each, internally, present, themselves, as, composite, works, compiled, by, several, editors, all, past, scholarship, on, their, dating, has, been, evaluated, by, meulenbeld, in, volumes, ia, and, ib, of, his, history, of, indian, medical, literature, after, considering, the, evidence, and, arguments, concerning, the, su, rutasa, hit, meulenbeld, stated, ia, 348, the, su, rutasa, hit, is, most, probably, the, work, of, an, unknown, author, who, drew, much, of, the, material, he, incorporated, in, his, treatise, from, a, multiplicity, of, earlier, sources, from, various, periods, this, may, explain, that, many, scholars, yield, to, the, temptation, to, recognize, a, number, of, distinct, layers, and, consequently, try, to, identify, elements, belonging, to, them, as, we, have, seen, the, identification, of, features, thought, to, belong, to, a, particular, stratum, is, in, many, cases, determined, by, preconceived, ideas, on, the, age, of, the, strata, and, their, supposed, authors, the, dating, of, this, work, to, 600, bce, was, first, proposed, by, hoernle, over, a, century, ago, but, has, long, since, been, overturned, by, subsequent, historical, research, the, current, consensus, amongst, medical, historians, of, south, asia, is, that, the, su, rutasa, hit, was, compiled, over, a, period, of, time, starting, with, a, kernel, of, medical, ideas, from, the, century, or, two, bce, and, then, being, revised, by, several, hands, into, its, present, form, by, about, 500, ce, the, view, that, the, text, was, updated, by, the, buddhist, scholar, nagarjuna, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, has, been, disproved, although, the, last, chapter, of, the, work, the, uttaratantra, was, added, by, an, unknown, later, author, before, 500, ce, similar, arguments, apply, to, the, charaka, samhita, written, by, charaka, and, the, bhela, samhita, attributed, to, atreya, punarvasu, that, are, also, dated, to, the, 6th, century, bce, by, non, specialist, scholars, but, are, in, fact, in, their, present, form, datable, to, a, period, between, the, second, and, fifth, centuries, ce, the, charaka, samhita, was, also, updated, by, dridhabala, during, the, early, centuries, of, the, common, era, the, bower, manuscript, dated, to, the, early, 6th, century, ce, includes, of, excerpts, from, the, bheda, samhita, and, its, description, of, concepts, in, central, asian, buddhism, in, 1987, a, f,
