a, hedgehog, is, a, spiny, mammal, of, the, subfamily, erinaceinae, in, the, eulipotyphlan, family, erinaceidae, there, are, seventeen, species, of, hedgehog, in, five, genera, found, throughout, parts, of, europe, asia, and, africa, and, in, new, zealand, by, introduction, there, are, no, hedgehogs, native, to, australia, and, no, living, species, native, to, the, americas, however, the, extinct, genus, amphechinus, was, once, present, in, north, america, hedgehogs, share, distant, ancestry, with, shrews, family, soricidae, with, gymnures, possibly, being, the, intermediate, link, and, they, have, changed, little, over, the, last, fifteen, million, years, like, many, of, the, first, mammals, they, have, adapted, to, a, nocturnal, way, of, life, their, spiny, protection, resembles, that, of, porcupines, which, are, rodents, and, echidnas, a, type, of, monotreme, the, name, hedgehog, came, into, use, around, the, year, 1450, derived, from, the, middle, english, heyghoge, from, heyg, hegge, hedge, because, it, frequents, hedgerows, and, hoge, hogge, hog, from, its, piglike, snout, another, name, that, is, used, is, hedgepig, hedgehogs, are, easily, recognized, by, their, spines, which, are, hollow, hairs, made, stiff, with, keratin, their, spines, are, not, poisonous, or, barbed, and, unlike, the, quills, of, a, porcupine, do, not, easily, detach, from, their, bodies, however, the, immature, animal, s, spines, normally, fall, out, as, they, are, replaced, with, adult, spines, this, is, called, quilling, spines, can, also, shed, when, the, animal, is, diseased, or, under, extreme, stress, hedgehogs, are, usually, brown, with, pale, tips, to, the, spines, though, blonde, hedgehogs, are, found, on, the, channel, island, of, alderney, hedgehogs, roll, into, a, tight, spiny, ball, when, threatened, tucking, in, the, furry, face, feet, and, belly, the, hedgehog, s, back, contains, two, large, muscles, that, direct, the, quills, some, light, weight, desert, hedgehog, species, with, fewer, spines, are, more, likely, to, flee, or, attack, ramming, an, intruder, with, the, spines, rolling, up, only, as, a, last, resort, hedgehogs, are, primarily, nocturnal, with, some, species, also, active, during, the, day, hedgehogs, sleep, for, a, large, portion, of, the, day, under, bushes, grasses, rocks, or, most, commonly, in, dens, dug, underground, all, wild, hedgehogs, can, hibernate, though, the, duration, depends, on, temperature, species, and, abundance, of, food, hedgehogs, are, fairly, vocal, with, a, variety, of, grunts, snuffles, and, or, squeals, they, occasionally, perform, a, ritual, called, anointing, when, the, animal, encounters, a, new, scent, it, will, lick, and, bite, the, source, then, form, a, scented, froth, in, its, mouth, and, paste, it, on, its, spines, with, its, tongue, some, experts, believe, this, might, serve, to, camouflage, the, hedgehog, with, the, local, scent, and, might, also, lead, to, infection, of, predators, poked, by, the, spines, anointing, is, sometimes, also, called, anting, after, a, similar, behavior, in, birds, like, opossums, mice, and, moles, hedgehogs, have, some, natural, immunity, against, some, snake, venom, through, the, protein, erinacin, in, their, muscles, though, in, such, small, amounts, that, a, viper, bite, may, still, be, fatal, in, addition, hedgehogs, are, one, of, four, known, mammalian, groups, with, natural, protection, against, another, snake, venom, neurotoxin, developing, independently, pigs, honey, badgers, mongooses, and, hedgehogs, all, have, mutations, in, the, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptor, that, prevent, the, binding, of, the, snake, venom, neurotoxin, the, sense, of, smell, has, been, little, studied, in, the, hedgehog, as, the, olfactory, part, of, the, mammal, brain, is, obscured, inside, the, neopallium, tests, have, suggested, that, hedgehogs, share, the, same, olfactory, electrical, activity, as, cats, although, traditionally, classified, in, the, abandoned, order, insectivora, hedgehogs, are, omnivorous, they, feed, on, insects, snails, frogs, and, toads, snakes, bird, eggs, carrion, mushrooms, grass, roots, berries, and, melons, afghan, hedgehogs, devour, berries, in, early, spring, after, hibernation, hedgehogs, have, been, observed, eating, cat, food, left, outdoors, for, pets, but, this, may, not, be, a, proper, food, for, hedgehogs, in, captivity, when, a, hedgehog, hibernates, its, normal, 30, 35, c, 86, 95, f, body, temperature, decreases, to, 2, 5, c, 36, 41, f, hedgehog, gestation, lasts, 35, 58, days, depending, on, species, the, average, litter, is, 3, 4, newborns, for, larger, species, and, 5, 6, for, smaller, ones, as, with, many, animals, it, is, not, unusual, for, an, adult, male, hedgehog, to, kill, newborn, males, hedgehogs, have, a, relatively, long, lifespan, for, their, size, in, captivity, lack, of, predators, and, controlled, diet, contribute, to, a, lifespan, of, 8, 10, years, depending, on, size, in, the, wild, larger, species, live, 4, 7, years, some, recorded, up, to, 16, years, and, smaller, species, live, 2, 4, years, 4, 7, in, captivity, this, compares, to, a, mouse, at, 2, years, and, a, large, rat, at, 3, 5, years, newborn, hoglets, are, blind, with, their, quills, covered, by, a, protective, membrane, which, dries, and, shrinks, over, several, hours, and, falls, off, after, cleaning, allowing, the, quills, to, emerge, the, various, species, have, many, predators, while, forest, hedgehogs, are, prey, primarily, to, birds, especially, owls, and, ferrets, smaller, species, like, the, long, eared, hedgehog, are, prey, to, foxes, wolves, and, mongooses, hedgehog, bones, have, been, found, in, the, pellets, of, the, eurasian, eagle, owl, in, britain, the, main, predator, is, the, european, badger, european, hedgehog, populations, in, the, united, kingdom, are, lower, in, areas, with, many, badgers, and, hedgehog, rescue, societies, will, not, release, hedgehogs, into, known, badger, territories, badgers, also, compete, with, hedgehogs, for, food, the, most, common, pet, species, of, hedgehog, are, hybrids, of, the, white, bellied, hedgehog, or, four, toed, hedgehog, atelerix, albiventris, and, the, smaller, north, african, hedgehog, a, algirus, pygmy, hedgehog, other, species, kept, as, pets, are, the, long, eared, hedgehog, hemiechinus, auritus, and, the, indian, long, eared, hedgehog, h, collaris, as, of, 2019, it, is, illegal, to, own, a, hedgehog, as, a, pet, in, four, us, states, including, hawaii, georgia, pennsylvania, and, california, as, well, as, new, york, city, washington, dc, and, some, canadian, municipalities, and, breeding, licenses, are, required, no, such, restrictions, exist, in, most, european, countries, with, the, exception, of, scandinavia, in, italy, it, is, illegal, to, keep, wild, hedgehogs, as, pets, in, areas, where, hedgehogs, have, been, introduced, such, as, new, zealand, and, the, islands, of, scotland, the, hedgehog, has, become, a, pest, lacking, natural, predators, in, new, zealand, it, has, decimated, native, species, including, insects, snails, lizards, and, ground, nesting, birds, particularly, shore, birds, eradication, can, be, troublesome, attempts, to, eliminate, hedgehogs, from, bird, colonies, on, the, scottish, islands, of, north, uist, and, benbecula, in, the, outer, hebrides, were, met, with, international, protest, eradication, began, in, 2003, with, 690, hedgehogs, killed, though, animal, welfare, groups, attempted, rescues, by, 2007, legal, injunctions, prohibited, the, killing, and, in, 2008, the, elimination, process, was, changed, to, trapping, and, releasing, on, the, mainland, in, 2022, it, was, reported, that, the, hedgehog, population, in, rural, britain, was, declining, rapidly, down, by, 30, 75, since, 2000, hedgehogs, suffer, many, diseases, common, to, mammals, including, cancer, fatty, liver, disease, and, cardiovascular, disease, cancer, is, very, common, in, hedgehogs, the, most, common, is, squamous, cell, carcinoma, which, spreads, quickly, from, bone, to, the, organs, unlike, in, humans, surgery, to, remove, the, bone, tumors, is, impractical, fatty, liver, and, heart, disease, are, believed, to, be, caused, by, bad, diet, and, obesity, hedgehogs, will, eagerly, eat, foods, high, in, fat, and, sugar, despite, a, metabolism, adapted, for, low, fat, protein, rich, insects, hedgehogs, are, also, highly, susceptible, to, pneumonia, with, difficulty, breathing, and, nasal, discharge, caused, by, the, bacterium, bordetella, bronchiseptica, hedgehogs, uncommonly, transmit, a, fungal, ringworm, or, dermatophytosis, skin, infection, to, human, handlers, and, other, hedgehogs, caused, by, trichophyton, erinacei, a, distinct, mating, group, among, the, arthroderma, benhamiae, fungi, hedgehogs, can, suffer, from, balloon, syndrome, a, rare, condition, in, which, gas, is, trapped, under, the, skin, from, injury, or, infection, causing, the, animal, to, inflate, the, condition, is, unique, to, hedgehogs, because, their, skin, is, baggy, enough, to, curl, up, in, 2017, the, bbc, reported, a, case, of, a, male, hedgehog, almost, twice, its, natural, size, literally, blown, up, like, a, beach, ball, with, incredibly, taut, skin, at, stapeley, s, wildlife, hospital, vet, bev, panto, said, i, have, seen, three, or, four, of, these, cases, and, they, are, very, strange, every, time, and, quite, shocking, when, you, first, see, them, they, appear, to, be, very, big, hedgehogs, but, when, you, pick, them, up, they, feel, so, light, because, they, are, mostly, air, the, british, hedgehog, preservation, society, advises, there, is, no, single, cause, for, this, condition, the, air, can, be, removed, by, incising, or, aspirating, through, the, skin, over, the, back, antibiotic, cover, should, be, given, this, may, be, associated, with, lung, chest, wall, damage, or, a, small, external, wound, acting, like, a, valve, or, a, clostridium, type, infection, as, with, most, small, mammals, living, around, humans, many, are, run, over, as, they, attempt, to, cross, roadways, in, ireland, hedgehogs, are, one, of, the, most, common, mammalian, road, fatalities, between, april, 2008, and, november, 2010, on, two, stretches, of, road, measuring, 227, km, and, 32, 5, km, there, were, 133, recorded, hedgehog, fatalities, of, another, 135, hedgehog, carcasses, collected, from, throughout, ireland, there, were, significantly, more, males, than, females, collected, with, peaks, in, male, deaths, occurring, in, may, and, june, female, deaths, outnumbered, males, only, in, august, with, further, peaks, in, female, deaths, observed, in, june, and, july, it, is, suggested, that, these, peaks, are, related, to, the, breeding, season, adults, and, dispersal, exploration, following, independence, domesticated, hedgehogs, can, get, their, heads, stuck, in, tubes, such, as, toilet, paper, tubes, and, walk, around, with, them, some, owners, call, this, tubing, and, promote, the, behavior, providing, a, tube, cut, lengthwise, to, allow, the, hedgehog, to, remove, it, some, hedgehogs, intentionally, wear, tubes, for, hours, hedgehogs, are, a, food, source, in, many, cultures, they, were, eaten, in, ancient, egypt, and, some, recipes, of, the, late, middle, ages, call, for, hedgehog, meat, they, are, traded, throughout, eurasia, and, africa, for, traditional, medicine, and, witchcraft, in, the, middle, east, and, especially, among, bedouins, hedgehog, meat, is, considered, medicine, against, rheumatism, and, arthritis, hedgehogs, are, also, said, to, cure, a, variety, of, disorders, from, tuberculosis, to, impotence, in, morocco, inhaling, the, smoke, of, the, burnt, skin, or, bristles, supposedly, remedies, fever, impotence, and, urinary, illnesses, the, blood, is, sold, as, a, cure, for, ringworm, cracked, skin, and, warts, and, the, flesh, is, eaten, as, a, remedy, for, witchcraft, romani, people, still, eat, hedgehogs, boiled, or, roasted, and, also, use, the, blood, and, the, fat, as, a, medicine, in, 1981, british, publican, philip, lewis, developed, a, line, of, hedgehog, flavoured, crisps, whose, taste, was, apparently, based, on, the, flavourings, used, by, romani, to, bake, hedgehogs, as, they, did, not, contain, any, actual, hedgehog, product, the, office, of, fair, trading, ordered, him, to, change, the, name, to, hedgehog, flavour, crisps, subfamily, erinaceinae, hedgehogs, in, worldwide, folklore, hedgehogs, are, associated, with, intelligence, and, wisdom, asia, europe, and, magic, africa
