rapeseed, brassica, napus, subsp, napus, also, known, as, rape, and, oilseed, rape, is, a, bright, yellow, flowering, member, of, the, family, brassicaceae, mustard, or, cabbage, family, cultivated, mainly, for, its, oil, rich, seed, which, naturally, contains, appreciable, amounts, of, erucic, acid, the, term, canola, denotes, a, group, of, rapeseed, cultivars, that, were, bred, to, have, very, low, levels, of, erucic, acid, and, which, are, especially, prized, for, use, as, human, and, animal, food, rapeseed, is, the, third, largest, source, of, vegetable, oil, and, the, second, largest, source, of, protein, meal, in, the, world, brassica, napus, grows, to, 100, centimetres, 39, inches, in, height, with, hairless, fleshy, pinnatifid, and, glaucous, lower, leaves, which, are, stalked, whereas, the, upper, leaves, have, no, petioles, rapeseed, flowers, are, bright, yellow, and, about, 17, millimetres, 3, 4, in, across, they, are, radial, and, consist, of, four, petals, in, a, typical, cross, form, alternating, with, four, sepals, they, have, indeterminate, racemose, flowering, starting, at, the, lowest, bud, and, growing, upward, in, the, following, days, the, flowers, have, two, lateral, stamens, with, short, filaments, and, four, median, stamens, with, longer, filaments, whose, anthers, split, away, from, the, flower, s, center, upon, flowering, the, rapeseed, pods, are, green, and, elongated, siliquae, during, development, that, eventually, ripen, to, brown, they, grow, on, pedicels, 1, to, 3, cm, 3, 8, to, 1, 3, 16, in, long, and, can, range, from, 5, to, 10, cm, 2, to, 4, in, in, length, each, pod, has, two, compartments, separated, by, an, inner, central, wall, within, which, a, row, of, seeds, develops, the, seeds, are, round, and, have, a, diameter, of, 1, 5, to, 3, mm, 1, 16, to, 1, 8, in, they, have, a, reticulate, surface, texture, and, are, black, and, hard, at, maturity, b, napus, can, be, distinguished, from, b, nigra, by, the, upper, leaves, which, do, not, clasp, the, stem, and, from, b, rapa, by, its, smaller, petals, which, are, less, than, 13, mm, 1, 2, in, across, the, species, brassica, napus, belongs, to, the, flowering, plant, family, brassicaceae, rapeseed, is, a, subspecies, with, the, autonym, b, napus, subsp, napus, it, encompasses, winter, and, spring, oilseed, vegetable, and, fodder, rape, siberian, kale, is, a, distinct, leaf, rape, form, variety, b, napus, var, pabularia, which, used, to, be, common, as, a, winter, annual, vegetable, the, second, subspecies, of, b, napus, is, b, napus, subsp, rapifera, also, subsp, napobrassica, the, rutabaga, swede, or, yellow, turnip, b, napus, is, a, digenomic, amphidiploid, that, occurred, due, to, the, interspecific, hybridization, between, b, oleracea, and, b, rapa, it, is, a, self, compatible, pollinating, species, like, the, other, amphidiploid, brassica, species, the, term, rape, derives, from, the, latin, word, for, turnip, r, pa, or, r, pum, cognate, with, the, greek, word, rhaphe, in, northern, ireland, b, napus, and, b, rapa, are, recorded, as, escapes, in, roadside, verges, and, waste, ground, crops, from, the, genus, brassica, including, rapeseed, were, among, the, earliest, plants, to, be, widely, cultivated, by, humankind, as, early, as, 10, 000, years, ago, rapeseed, was, being, cultivated, in, india, as, early, as, 4000, b, c, and, it, spread, to, china, and, japan, 2000, years, ago, rapeseed, oil, is, predominantly, cultivated, in, its, winter, form, in, most, of, europe, and, asia, due, to, the, requirement, of, vernalization, to, start, the, process, of, flowering, it, is, sown, in, autumn, and, remains, in, a, leaf, rosette, on, the, soil, surface, during, the, winter, the, plant, grows, a, long, vertical, stem, in, the, next, spring, followed, by, lateral, branch, development, it, generally, flowers, in, late, spring, with, the, process, of, pod, development, and, ripening, occurring, over, a, period, of, 6, 8, weeks, until, midsummer, in, europe, winter, rapeseed, is, grown, as, an, annual, break, crop, in, three, to, four, year, rotations, with, cereals, such, as, wheat, and, barley, and, break, crops, such, as, peas, and, beans, this, is, done, to, reduce, the, possibility, of, pests, and, diseases, being, carried, over, from, one, crop, to, another, winter, rape, is, less, susceptible, to, crop, failure, as, it, is, more, vigorous, than, the, summer, variety, and, can, compensate, for, damage, done, by, pests, spring, rapeseed, is, cultivated, in, canada, northern, europe, and, australia, as, it, is, not, winter, hardy, and, does, not, require, vernalization, the, crop, is, sown, in, spring, with, stem, development, happening, immediately, after, germination, rapeseed, can, be, cultivated, on, a, wide, variety, of, well, drained, soils, prefers, a, ph, between, 5, 5, and, 8, 3, and, has, a, moderate, tolerance, of, soil, salinity, it, is, predominantly, a, wind, pollinated, plant, but, shows, significantly, increased, grain, yields, when, bee, pollinated, almost, double, the, final, yield, but, the, effect, is, cultivar, dependent, it, is, currently, grown, with, high, levels, of, nitrogen, containing, fertilisers, and, the, manufacture, of, these, generates, n, 2, o, an, estimated, 3, 5, of, nitrogen, provided, as, fertilizer, for, rapeseed, is, converted, to, n, 2, o, rapeseed, has, a, high, demand, for, nutrients, in, particular, its, sulphur, demand, is, the, highest, among, all, arable, crops, since, the, decrease, of, atmospheric, sulphur, inputs, during, the, 1980s, sulphur, fertilization, has, become, a, standard, measure, in, oilseed, rape, production, among, the, micronutrients, special, attention, in, rapeseed, cultivation, has, to, be, given, to, boron, manganese, and, molybdenum, the, cultivatable, range, for, rapeseed, is, expected, to, decrease, due, to, climate, change, the, quality, of, the, crop, in, both, yield, and, volume, of, oil, is, also, expected, to, decrease, substantially, some, researchers, recommend, finding, alternative, varieties, of, brassica, for, cultivation, the, main, diseases, of, the, winter, rapeseed, crop, are, canker, light, leaf, spot, pyrenopeziza, brassicae, alternaria, and, sclerotinia, stem, rots, canker, causes, leaf, spotting, and, premature, ripening, and, weakening, of, the, stem, during, the, autumn, winter, fall, winter, period, a, conazole, or, triazole, fungicide, treatment, is, required, in, late, autumn, fall, and, in, spring, against, canker, while, broad, spectrum, fungicides, are, used, during, the, spring, summer, period, for, alternaria, and, sclerotinia, control, oilseed, rape, cannot, be, planted, in, close, rotation, with, itself, due, to, soil, borne, diseases, such, as, sclerotinia, verticillium, wilt, and, clubroot, transgenic, rapeseed, shows, great, promise, for, disease, resistance, transexpression, of, a, class, ii, chitinase, from, barley, hordeum, vulgare, and, a, type, i, ribosome, inactivating, protein, into, b, juncea, produces, a, large, fungal, resistance, effect, chhikara, et, al, 2012, finds, that, this, combination, of, transgenes, reduces, hyphal, growth, by, 44, and, delays, disease, presentation, in, alternaria, brassicicola, of, juncea, blackleg, leptosphaeria, maculans, phoma, lingam, is, a, major, disease, yu, et, al, 2005, uses, restriction, fragment, length, polymorphism, analysis, on, two, doubled, haploid, populations, dhp95, and, dhp96, they, find, one, resistance, genes, in, each, lepr1, and, lepr1, rapeseed, is, attacked, by, a, wide, variety, of, insects, nematodes, slugs, as, well, as, wood, pigeons, the, brassica, pod, midge, dasineura, brassicae, cabbage, seed, weevil, ceutorhynchus, assimilis, cabbage, stem, weevil, ceutorhynchus, pallidactylus, cabbage, stem, flea, beetle, psylliodes, chrysocephala, rape, stem, weevil, ceutorhynchus, napi, and, pollen, beetles, are, the, primary, insect, pests, that, prey, on, the, oilseed, rape, crop, in, europe, the, insect, pests, can, feed, on, developing, pods, to, lay, eggs, inside, and, eat, the, developing, seeds, bore, into, the, plant, s, stem, and, feed, on, pollen, leaves, and, flowers, synthetic, pyrethroid, insecticides, are, the, main, attack, vector, against, insect, pests, though, there, is, a, large, scale, use, of, prophylactic, insecticides, in, many, countries, molluscicide, pellets, are, used, either, before, or, after, sowing, of, the, rapeseed, crop, to, protect, against, slugs, in, 2014, an, snp, array, was, released, for, b, napus, by, dalton, morgan, et, al, and, another, by, clarke, et, al, in, 2016, both, of, which, have, since, become, widely, used, in, molecular, breeding, in, a, demonstration, of, the, importance, of, epigenetics, hauben, et, al, 2009, found, that, isogenic, lines, did, not, have, identical, energy, use, efficiencies, in, actual, growing, conditions, due, to, epigenetic, differences, specific, locus, amplified, fragment, sequencing, slaf, seq, was, applied, to, b, napus, by, geng, et, al, in, 2016, revealing, the, genetics, of, the, past, domestication, process, providing, data, for, genome, wide, association, studies, gwas, and, being, used, to, construct, a, high, density, linkage, map, in, 1973, canadian, agricultural, scientists, launched, a, marketing, campaign, to, promote, canola, consumption, seed, oil, and, protein, meal, derived, from, rapeseed, cultivars, which, are, low, in, erucic, acid, and, low, in, glucosinolates, was, originally, registered, as, a, trademark, in, 1978, of, the, canola, council, of, canada, as, canola, canola, is, now, a, generic, term, for, edible, varieties, of, rapeseed, but, is, still, officially, defined, in, canada, as, rapeseed, oil, that, must, contain, less, than, 2, erucic, acid, and, less, than, 30, mol, of, glucosinolates, per, gram, of, air, dried, oil, free, meal, in, the, 1980s, decreasing, atmospheric, sulphur, inputs, to, northern, european, soils, in, connection, with, a, less, efficient, internal, use, of, sulphur, in, the, metabolism, of, the, newly, bred, low, glucosinolate, varieties, 00, varieties, resulted, in, an, increased, appearance, of, white, flowering, a, highly, specific, symptom, of, sulphur, deficiency, in, rapeseed, crops, which, during, the, official, variety, assessment, procedures, was, wrongly, attributed, to, a, genetic, inhomogeneity, canadian, blood, the, anticipated, damages, of, wild, animals, caused, by, foraging, on, 00, oilseed, rape, crops, was, caused, by, a, shift, of, the, animals, diet, towards, increased, uptake, protein, and, sulphur, containing, metabolites, at, the, expense, of, fibers, but, not, to, specific, features, of, the, genetically, altered, 00, varieties, following, the, european, parliament, s, transport, biofuels, directive, in, 2003, promoting, the, use, of, biofuels, the, cultivation, of, winter, rapeseed, increased, dramatically, in, europe, bayer, cropscience, in, collaboration, with, bgi, shenzhen, china, keygene, the, netherlands, and, the, university, of, queensland, australia, announced, it, had, sequenced, the, entire, genome, of, b, napus, and, its, constituent, genomes, present, in, b, rapa, and, b, oleracea, in, 2009, the, a, genome, component, of, the, amphidiploid, rapeseed, species, b, napus, has, been, sequenced, by, the, multinational, brassica, genome, project, a, genetically, modified, variety, of, rapeseed, was, developed, in, 1998, engineered, for, glyphosate, tolerance, and, is, considered, to, be, the, most, disease, and, drought, resistant, canola, by, 2009, 90, of, the, rapeseed, crops, planted, in, canada, were, of, this, sort, the, monsanto, company, genetically, engineered, new, cultivars, of, rapeseed, to, be, resistant, to, the, effects, of, its, herbicide, roundup, in, 1998, they, brought, this, to, the, canadian, market, monsanto, sought, compensation, from, farmers, found, to, have, crops, of, this, cultivar, in, their, fields, without, paying, a, license, fee, however, these, farmers, claimed, that, the, pollen, containing, the, roundup, ready, gene, was, blown, into, their, fields, and, crossed, with, unaltered, canola, other, farmers, claimed, that, after, spraying, roundup, in, non, canola, fields, to, kill, weeds, before, planting, roundup, ready, volunteers, were, left, behind, causing, extra, expense, to, rid, their, fields, of, the, weeds, in, a, closely, followed, legal, battle, the, supreme, court, of, canada, found, in, favor, of, monsanto, s, patent, infringement, claim, for, unlicensed, growing, of, roundup, ready, in, its, 2004, ruling, on, monsanto, canada, inc, v, schmeiser, but, also, ruled, that, schmeiser, was, not, required, to, pay, any, damages, the, case, garnered, international, controversy, as, a, court, sanctioned, legitimization, for, the, global, patent, protection, of, genetically, modified, crops, in, march, 2008, an, out, of, court, settlement, between, monsanto, and, schmeiser, agreed, that, monsanto, would, clean, up, the, entire, gmo, canola, crop, on, schmeiser, s, farm, at, a, cost, of, about, can, 660, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, reports, global, production, of, 36, million, metric, tons, 40, million, short, tons, 35, million, long, tons, in, the, 2003, 2004, season, and, an, estimated, 58, 4, million, metric, tons, 64, 4, million, short, tons, 57, 5, million, long, tons, in, the, 2010, 2011, season, worldwide, production, of, rapeseed, including, canola, has, increased, sixfold, between, 1975, and, 2007, the, production, of, canola, and, rapeseed, since, 1975, has, opened, up, the, edible, oil, market, for, rapeseed, oil, since, 2002, production, of, biodiesel, has, been, steadily, increasing, in, eu, and, u, s, to, 6, million, metric, tons, 6, 6, million, short, tons, 5, 9, million, long, tons, in, 2006, rapeseed, oil, is, positioned, to, supply, a, good, portion, of, the, vegetable, oils, needed, to, produce, that, fuel, world, production, was, thus, expected, to, trend, further, upward, between, 2005, and, 2015, as, biodiesel, content, requirements, in, europe, go, into, effect, rapeseed, is, grown, for, the, production, of, edible, vegetable, oils, animal, feed, and, biodiesel, rapeseed, was, the, third, leading, source, of, vegetable, oil, in, the, world, in, 2000, after, soybean, and, palm, oil, it, is, the, world, s, second, leading, source, of, protein, meal, after, soybean, rapeseed, oil, is, one, of, the, oldest, known, vegetable, oils, but, historically, was, used, in, limited, quantities, due, to, high, levels, of, erucic, acid, which, is, damaging, to, cardiac, muscle, of, animals, and, glucosinolates, which, made, it, less, nutritious, in, animal, feed, rapeseed, oil, can, contain, up, to, 54, erucic, acid, food, grade, oil, derived, from, rapeseed, cultivars, known, as, canola, oil, or, low, erucic, acid, rapeseed, oil, lear, oil, has, been, generally, recognized, as, safe, by, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, canola, oil, is, limited, by, government, regulation, to, a, maximum, of, 2, erucic, acid, by, weight, in, the, us, and, 2, in, the, eu, with, special, regulations, for, infant, food, these, low, levels, of, erucic, acid, are, not, believed, to, cause, harm, in, human, infants, processing, of, rapeseed, for, oil, production, produces, rapeseed, meal, as, a, byproduct, the, byproduct, is, a, high, protein, animal, feed, competitive, with, soybean, rapeseed, is, an, excellent, silage, crop, fermented, and, stored, in, air, tight, conditions, for, later, use, as, a, winterfeed, the, feed, is, employed, mostly, for, cattle, feeding, but, is, also, used, for, pigs, and, poultry, however, the, high, levels, of, glucosinolates, sinapine, and, phytic, acid, in, the, seed, cake, of, rapeseed, cause, detrimental, health, effects, to, animals, reduce, digestibility, of, certain, nutrients, reduce, palatability, and, contribute, to, eutrophication, of, waterways, in, china, rapeseed, meal, is, mostly, used, as, a, soil, fertilizer, rather, than, for, animal, feed, rapeseed, oil, is, used, as, diesel, fuel, either, as, biodiesel, straight, in, heated, fuel, systems, or, blended, with, petroleum, distillates, for, powering, motor, vehicles, biodiesel, may, be, used, in, pure, form, in, newer, engines, without, engine, damage, and, is, frequently, combined, with, fossil, fuel, diesel, in, ratios, varying, from, 2, to, 20, biodiesel, owing, to, the, costs, of, growing, crushing, and, refining, rapeseed, biodiesel, rapeseed, derived, biodiesel, from, new, oil, costs, more, to, produce, than, standard, diesel, fuel, so, diesel, fuels, are, commonly, made, from, the, used, oil, rapeseed, oil, is, the, preferred, oil, stock, for, biodiesel, production, in, most, of, europe, accounting, for, about, 80, of, the, feedstock, partly, because, rapeseed, produces, more, oil, per, unit, of, land, area, compared, to, other, oil, sources, such, as, soybeans, but, primarily, because, canola, oil, has, a, significantly, lower, gel, point, than, most, other, vegetable, oils, because, of, the, changes, to, the, environment, caused, by, climate, change, a, 2018, study, predicted, that, rapeseed, would, become, an, unreliable, source, of, oil, for, biofuels, rapeseed, is, also, used, as, a, cover, crop, in, the, us, during, the, winter, as, it, prevents, soil, erosion, produces, large, amounts, of, biomass, suppresses, weeds, and, can, improve, soil, tilth, with, its, root, system, some, cultivars, of, rapeseed, are, also, used, as, annual, forage, and, are, ready, for, grazing, livestock, 80, to, 90, days, after, planting, rapeseed, has, a, high, melliferous, potential, produces, substances, that, can, be, collected, by, insects, and, is, a, main, forage, crop, for, honeybees, monofloral, rapeseed, honey, has, a, whitish, or, milky, yellow, color, peppery, taste, and, due, to, its, fast, crystallization, time, a, soft, solid, texture, it, crystallizes, within, 3, to, 4, weeks, and, can, ferment, over, time, if, stored, improperly, the, low, fructose, to, glucose, ratio, in, monofloral, rapeseed, honey, causes, it, to, quickly, granulate, in, the, honeycomb, forcing, beekeepers, to, extract, the, honey, within, 24, hours, of, it, being, capped, as, a, biolubricant, rapeseed, has, possible, uses, for, bio, medical, applications, e, g, lubricants, for, artificial, joints, and, the, use, of, personal, lubricant, for, sexual, purposes, biolubricant, containing, 70, or, more, canola, rapeseed, oil, has, replaced, petroleum, based, chainsaw, oil, in, austria, although, it, is, typically, more, expensive, rapeseed, has, been, researched, as, a, means, of, containing, radionuclides, that, contaminated, the, soil, after, the, chernobyl, disaster, as, it, has, a, rate, of, uptake, up, to, three, times, more, than, other, grains, and, only, about, 3, to, 6, of, the, radionuclides, go, into, the, oilseeds, rapeseed, meal, can, be, incorporated, into, the, soil, as, a, biofumigant, it, suppresses, such, fungal, crop, pathogens, as, rhizoctonia, solani, and, pratylenchus, penetr, 39, hulse, kemp, amanda,
