the, swifts, are, a, family, apodidae, of, highly, aerial, birds, they, are, superficially, similar, to, swallows, but, are, not, closely, related, to, any, passerine, species, swifts, are, placed, in, the, order, apodiformes, with, hummingbirds, the, treeswifts, are, closely, related, to, the, true, swifts, but, form, a, separate, family, the, hemiprocnidae, resemblances, between, swifts, and, swallows, are, due, to, convergent, evolution, reflecting, similar, life, styles, based, on, catching, insects, in, flight, the, family, name, apodidae, is, derived, from, the, greek, pous, meaning, footless, a, reference, to, the, small, weak, legs, of, these, most, aerial, of, birds, the, tradition, of, depicting, swifts, without, feet, continued, into, the, middle, ages, as, seen, in, the, heraldic, martlet, taxonomists, have, long, classified, swifts, and, treeswifts, as, relatives, of, the, hummingbirds, a, judgment, corroborated, by, the, discovery, of, the, jungornithidae, apparently, swift, like, hummingbird, relatives, and, of, primitive, hummingbirds, such, as, eurotrochilus, traditional, taxonomies, place, the, hummingbird, family, trochilidae, in, the, same, order, as, the, swifts, and, treeswifts, and, no, other, birds, the, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, treated, this, group, as, a, superorder, in, which, the, swift, order, was, called, trochiliformes, the, taxonomy, of, the, swifts, is, complicated, with, genus, and, species, boundaries, widely, disputed, especially, amongst, the, swiftlets, analysis, of, behavior, and, vocalizations, is, complicated, by, common, parallel, evolution, while, analyses, of, different, morphological, traits, and, of, various, dna, sequences, have, yielded, equivocal, and, partly, contradictory, results, the, apodiformes, diversified, during, the, eocene, at, the, end, of, which, the, extant, families, were, present, fossil, genera, are, known, from, all, over, temperate, europe, between, today, s, denmark, and, france, such, as, the, primitive, swift, like, scaniacypselus, early, middle, eocene, and, the, more, modern, procypseloides, late, eocene, early, oligocene, early, miocene, a, prehistoric, genus, sometimes, assigned, to, the, swifts, primapus, early, eocene, of, england, might, also, be, a, more, distant, ancestor, there, are, around, 100, species, of, swifts, normally, grouped, into, two, subfamilies, and, four, tribes, cypseloidinae, apodinae, swifts, are, among, the, fastest, of, birds, in, level, flight, and, larger, species, like, the, white, throated, needletail, have, been, reported, travelling, at, up, to, 169, km, h, 105, mph, even, the, common, swift, can, cruise, at, a, maximum, speed, of, 31, metres, per, second, 112, km, h, 70, mph, in, a, single, year, the, common, swift, can, cover, at, least, 200, 000, km, and, in, a, lifetime, about, two, million, kilometers, the, wingtip, bones, of, swiftlets, are, of, proportionately, greater, length, than, those, of, most, other, birds, changing, the, angle, between, the, bones, of, the, wingtips, and, forelimbs, allows, swifts, to, alter, the, shape, and, area, of, their, wings, to, increase, their, efficiency, and, maneuverability, at, various, speeds, they, share, with, their, relatives, the, hummingbirds, a, unique, ability, to, rotate, their, wings, from, the, base, allowing, the, wing, to, remain, rigid, and, fully, extended, and, derive, power, on, both, the, upstroke, and, downstroke, the, downstroke, produces, both, lift, and, thrust, while, the, upstroke, produces, a, negative, thrust, drag, that, is, 60, of, the, thrust, generated, during, the, downstrokes, but, simultaneously, it, contributes, lift, that, is, also, 60, of, what, is, produced, during, the, downstroke, this, flight, arrangement, might, benefit, the, bird, s, control, and, maneuverability, in, the, air, the, swiftlets, or, cave, swiftlets, have, developed, a, form, of, echolocation, for, navigating, through, dark, cave, systems, where, they, roost, one, species, the, three, toed, swiftlet, has, recently, been, found, to, use, this, navigation, at, night, outside, its, cave, roost, too, swifts, occur, on, all, the, continents, except, antarctica, but, not, in, the, far, north, in, large, deserts, or, on, many, oceanic, islands, the, swifts, of, temperate, regions, are, strongly, migratory, and, winter, in, the, tropics, some, species, can, survive, short, periods, of, cold, weather, by, entering, torpor, a, state, similar, to, hibernation, many, have, a, characteristic, shape, with, a, short, forked, tail, and, very, long, swept, back, wings, that, resemble, a, crescent, or, a, boomerang, the, flight, of, some, species, is, characterised, by, a, distinctive, flicking, action, quite, different, from, swallows, swifts, range, in, size, from, the, pygmy, swiftlet, collocalia, troglodytes, which, weighs, 5, 4, g, and, measures, 9, cm, 3, 5, in, long, to, the, purple, needletail, hirundapus, celebensis, which, weighs, 184, g, 6, 5, oz, and, measures, 25, cm, 9, 8, in, long, the, nest, of, many, species, is, glued, to, a, vertical, surface, with, saliva, and, the, genus, aerodramus, use, only, that, substance, which, is, the, basis, for, bird, s, nest, soup, other, swifts, select, holes, and, small, cavities, in, walls, the, eggs, hatch, after, 19, to, 23, days, and, the, young, leave, the, nest, after, a, further, six, to, eight, weeks, both, parents, assist, in, raising, the, young, swifts, as, a, family, have, smaller, egg, clutches, and, much, longer, and, more, variable, incubation, and, fledging, times, than, passerines, with, similarly, sized, eggs, resembling, tubenoses, in, these, developmental, factors, young, birds, reach, a, maximum, weight, heavier, than, their, parents, they, can, cope, with, not, being, fed, for, long, periods, of, time, and, delay, their, feather, growth, when, undernourished, swifts, and, seabirds, have, generally, secure, nest, sites, but, their, food, sources, are, unreliable, whereas, passerines, are, vulnerable, in, the, nest, but, food, is, usually, plentiful, all, swifts, eat, insects, such, as, dragonflies, flies, ants, aphids, wasps, and, bees, as, well, as, aerial, spiders, prey, is, typically, caught, in, flight, using, the, beak, some, species, like, the, chimney, swift, hunt, in, mixed, species, flocks, with, other, aerial, insectivores, such, as, members, of, hirundinidae, swallows, no, swift, species, has, become, extinct, since, 1600, but, birdlife, international, has, assessed, the, guam, swiftlet, as, endangered, and, lists, the, atiu, dark, rumped, seychelles, and, tahiti, swiftlets, as, vulnerable, twelve, other, species, are, near, threatened, or, lack, sufficient, data, for, classification, the, hardened, saliva, nests, of, the, edible, nest, swiftlet, and, the, black, nest, swiftlet, have, been, used, in, chinese, cooking, for, over, 400, years, most, often, as, bird, s, nest, soup, over, harvesting, of, this, expensive, delicacy, has, led, to, a, decline, in, the, numbers, of, these, swiftlets, especially, as, the, nests, are, also, thought, to, have, health, benefits, and, aphrodisiac, properties, most, nests, are, built, during, the, breeding, season, by, the, male, swiftlet, over, a, period, of, 35, days, they, take, the, shape, of, a, shallow, cup, stuck, to, the, cave, wall, the, nests, are, composed, of, interwoven, strands, of, salivary, cement, and, contain, high, levels, of, calcium, iron, potassium, and, magnesium
