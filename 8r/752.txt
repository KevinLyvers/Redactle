21, 8, 3, 6, million, years, ago, in, the, early, miocene, and, genetically, diverged, into, two, main, genetic, lineages, between, 19, 1, and, 18, 5, 3, 5, million, years, ago, the, name, is, derived, from, names, used, in, india, for, herpestes, species, mu, g, s, or, ma, g, s, in, classical, hindi, mu, g, s, in, marathi, mungisa, in, telugu, mungi, mungisi, and, munguli, in, kannada,

bear, a, striking, resemblance, to, mustelids, their, nonretractile, claws, are, used, primarily, for, digging, mongooses, much, like, goats, have, narrow, ovular, pupils, most, species, have, a, large, anal, scent, gland, used, for, territorial, marking, and, signaling, reproductive, status, the, dental, formula, of, mongooses, is, 3, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, they, range, from, 24,

herpestinae, and, mungotinae, this, grouping, was, supported, by, reginald, innes, pocock, in, 1919, who, referred, to, the, family, as, mungotidae, genetic, research, based, on, nuclear, and, mitochondrial, dna, analyses, revealed, that, the, galidiinae, are, more, closely, related, to, madagascar, carnivores, including, the, fossa, and, malagasy, civet, galidiinae, is, considered, a, subfamily, of, eupleridae, phylogenetic, research, of, 18, mongoose, species, revealed, that, the, solitary, and, social, mongooses, form, different, clades, the, phylogenetic, relationships, of,
