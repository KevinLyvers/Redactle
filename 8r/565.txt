for, genera, see, text, skinks, are, lizards, belonging, to, the, family, scincidae, a, family, in, the, infraorder, scincomorpha, with, more, than, 1, 500, described, species, across, 100, different, taxonomic, genera, the, family, scincidae, is, one, of, the, most, diverse, families, of, lizards, skinks, are, characterized, by, their, smaller, legs, in, comparison, to, typical, lizards, and, are, found, in, different, habitats, except, arctic, and, subarctic, regions, the, word, skink, which, entered, the, english, language, around, 1580, 1590, comes, from, classical, greek, skinkos, and, latin, scincus, names, that, referred, to, various, specific, lizards, skinks, look, like, lizards, of, the, family, lacertidae, sometimes, called, true, lizards, but, most, species, of, skinks, have, no, pronounced, neck, and, relatively, small, legs, several, genera, e, g, typhlosaurus, have, no, limbs, at, all, this, is, not, true, for, all, skinks, however, as, some, species, such, as, the, red, eyed, crocodile, skink, have, a, head, that, is, very, distinguished, from, the, body, these, lizards, also, have, legs, that, are, relatively, small, proportional, to, their, body, size, skinks, skulls, are, covered, by, substantial, bony, scales, usually, matching, up, in, shape, and, size, while, overlapping, other, genera, such, as, neoseps, have, reduced, limbs, and, fewer, than, five, toes, digits, on, each, foot, in, such, species, their, locomotion, resembles, that, of, snakes, more, than, that, of, lizards, with, well, developed, limbs, as, a, general, rule, the, longer, the, digits, the, more, arboreal, the, species, is, likely, to, be, a, biological, ratio, can, determine, the, ecological, niche, of, a, given, skink, species, the, scincidae, ecological, niche, index, seni, is, a, ratio, based, on, anterior, foot, length, at, the, junction, of, the, ulna, radius, carpal, bones, to, the, longest, digit, divided, by, the, snout, to, vent, length, most, species, of, skinks, have, long, tapering, tails, they, can, shed, if, predators, grab, onto, them, such, species, generally, can, regenerate, the, lost, part, of, a, tail, though, imperfectly, a, lost, tail, can, grow, back, within, around, three, to, four, months, species, with, stumpy, tails, have, no, special, regenerative, abilities, some, species, of, skinks, are, quite, small, scincella, lateralis, typically, ranges, from, 7, 5, to, 14, 5, cm, 3, to, 5, 3, 4, in, more, than, half, of, which, is, the, tail, most, skinks, though, are, medium, sized, with, snout, to, vent, lengths, around, 12, cm, 4, 1, 2, in, although, some, grow, larger, the, solomon, islands, skink, corucia, zebrata, is, the, largest, known, extant, species, and, may, attain, a, snout, to, vent, length, of, some, 35, cm, 14, in, skinks, can, often, hide, easily, in, their, habitat, because, of, their, protective, colouring, camouflage, skinks, in, the, genus, prasinohaema, have, green, blood, because, of, a, buildup, of, the, waste, product, biliverdin, the, oldest, known, skink, is, electroscincus, zedi, described, from, the, mid, cretaceous, late, albian, to, early, cenomanian, burmese, amber, from, myanmar, dating, to, around, 100, million, years, ago, based, on, the, presence, of, osteoderms, electroscincus, appears, to, belong, to, the, scincidae, crown, group, indicating, that, some, divergence, among, the, extant, skink, subfamilies, must, have, already, occurred, by, 100, million, years, ago, other, definitive, skink, fossils, are, known, from, the, miocene, skink, genera, known, from, fossils, include, the, following, a, trait, apparent, in, many, species, of, skink, is, digging, and, burrowing, many, spend, their, time, underground, where, they, are, mostly, safe, from, predators, sometimes, even, digging, out, tunnels, for, easy, navigation, they, also, use, their, tongues, to, sniff, the, air, and, track, their, prey, when, they, encounter, their, prey, they, chase, it, down, until, they, corner, it, or, manage, to, land, a, bite, and, then, swallow, it, whole, despite, being, voracious, hunters, at, times, all, species, pose, no, threat, to, humans, and, will, generally, avoid, interaction, in, the, wild, being, neither, poisonous, or, venomous, their, bites, are, also, mild, and, minor, skinks, are, generally, carnivorous, and, in, particular, insectivorous, typical, prey, include, flies, crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, and, caterpillars, various, species, also, eat, earthworms, millipedes, centipedes, snails, slugs, isopods, woodlice, etc, moths, small, lizards, including, geckos, and, small, rodents, some, species, particularly, those, favored, as, home, pets, are, omnivorous, and, have, more, varied, diets, and, can, be, maintained, on, a, regimen, of, roughly, 60, vegetables, leaves, fruit, and, 40, meat, insects, and, rodents, species, of, the, genus, tristiidon, are, mainly, frugivorous, but, occasionally, eat, moss, and, insects, although, most, species, of, skinks, are, oviparous, laying, eggs, in, clutches, some, 45, of, skink, species, are, viviparous, in, one, sense, or, another, many, species, are, ovoviviparous, the, young, skinklets, developing, lecithotrophically, in, eggs, that, hatch, inside, the, mother, s, reproductive, tract, and, emerging, as, live, births, in, some, genera, however, such, as, tiliqua, and, corucia, the, young, developing, in, the, reproductive, tract, derive, their, nourishment, from, a, mammal, like, placenta, attached, to, the, female, unambiguous, examples, of, viviparous, matrotrophy, furthermore, an, example, recently, described, in, trachylepis, ivensi, is, the, most, extreme, to, date, a, purely, reptilian, placenta, directly, comparable, in, structure, and, function, to, a, eutherian, placenta, clearly, such, vivipary, repeatedly, has, developed, independently, in, the, evolutionary, history, of, the, scincidae, and, the, different, examples, are, not, ancestral, to, the, others, in, particular, placental, development, of, whatever, degree, in, lizards, is, phylogenetically, analogous, rather, than, homologous, to, functionally, similar, processes, in, mammals, skinks, typically, seek, out, environments, protected, from, the, elements, such, as, thick, foliage, underneath, man, made, structures, and, ground, level, buildings, such, as, garages, and, first, floor, apartments, when, two, or, more, skinks, are, seen, in, a, small, area, it, is, typical, to, find, a, nest, nearby, skinks, are, considered, to, be, territorial, and, often, are, seen, standing, in, front, of, or, guarding, their, nest, area, if, a, nest, is, nearby, one, can, expect, to, see, 10, 30, lizards, within, the, period, of, a, month, in, parts, of, the, southern, united, states, nests, are, commonly, found, in, houses, and, apartments, especially, along, the, coast, the, nest, is, where, the, skink, lays, its, small, white, eggs, up, to, 4, 8, at, a, time, skinks, are, very, specific, in, their, habitat, as, some, can, depend, on, vegetation, while, others, may, depend, on, land, and, the, soil, as, a, family, skinks, are, cosmopolitan, species, occur, in, a, variety, of, habitats, worldwide, apart, from, boreal, and, polar, regions, various, species, occur, in, ecosystems, ranging, from, deserts, and, mountains, to, grasslands, many, species, are, good, burrowers, more, species, are, terrestrial, or, fossorial, burrowing, than, arboreal, tree, climbing, or, aquatic, species, some, are, sand, swimmers, especially, the, desert, species, such, as, the, mole, skink, or, sand, skink, in, florida, some, use, a, very, similar, action, in, moving, through, grass, tussocks, most, skinks, are, diurnal, day, active, and, typically, bask, on, rocks, or, logs, during, the, day, raccoons, foxes, possums, snakes, coatis, weasels, crows, cats, dogs, herons, hawks, lizards, and, other, predators, of, small, land, vertebrates, also, prey, on, various, skinks, this, can, be, troublesome, given, the, long, gestation, period, for, some, skinks, making, them, an, easy, target, to, predators, such, as, the, mongoose, which, often, threaten, the, species, to, at, least, near, extinction, such, as, the, anguilla, bank, skink, invasive, rodents, are, a, major, threat, to, skinks, that, have, been, overlooked, especially, tropical, skinks, skinks, are, also, hunted, for, food, by, indigenous, peoples, in, new, guinea, including, by, the, kalam, people, in, the, highlands, of, madang, province, papua, new, guinea, despite, making, up, 15, of, reptiles, skinks, have, a, relatively, conserved, chromosome, number, between, 11, and, 16, pairs, skink, genomes, are, typically, about, 1, 5, gb, approximately, one, half, the, size, of, the, human, genome, the, christmas, island, blue, tailed, skink, cryptoblepharus, egeriae, was, sequenced, in, 2022, representing, the, first, skink, reference, genome, skinks, were, long, thought, to, have, both, genetic, sex, determination, gsd, and, temperature, dependent, sex, determination, tsd, despite, having, sex, chromosomes, that, are, not, distinguishable, with, a, microscope, all, major, skink, lineages, share, an, old, xy, system, that, is, over, 80, million, years, old, these, x, and, y, specific, regions, are, highly, divergent, and, contain, multiple, chromosomal, rearrangements, and, repetitive, sequences, many, genera, mabuya, for, example, are, still, insufficiently, studied, and, their, systematics, are, at, times, controversial, see, for, example, the, taxonomy, of, the, western, skink, plestiodon, skiltonianus, mabuya, in, particular, is, being, split, many, species, being, allocated, to, new, genera, such, as, trachylepis, chioninia, and,
