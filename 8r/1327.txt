in, a, physical, examination, medical, examination, clinical, examination, or, medical, checkup, a, medical, practitioner, examines, a, patient, for, any, possible, medical, signs, or, symptoms, of, a, medical, condition, it, generally, consists, of, a, series, of, questions, about, the, patient, s, medical, history, followed, by, an, examination, based, on, the, reported, symptoms, together, the, medical, history, and, the, physical, examination, help, to, determine, a, diagnosis, and, devise, the, treatment, plan, these, data, then, become, part, of, the, medical, record, the, routine, physical, also, known, as, general, medical, examination, periodic, health, evaluation, annual, physical, comprehensive, medical, exam, general, health, check, preventive, health, examination, medical, check, up, or, simply, medical, is, a, physical, examination, performed, on, an, asymptomatic, patient, for, medical, screening, purposes, these, are, normally, performed, by, a, pediatrician, family, practice, physician, a, physical, therapist, physician, assistant, a, certified, nurse, practitioner, or, other, primary, care, provider, this, routine, physical, exam, usually, includes, the, heent, evaluation, nursing, professionals, such, as, registered, nurse, licensed, practical, nurses, can, develop, a, baseline, assessment, to, identify, normal, versus, abnormal, findings, these, are, reported, to, the, primary, care, provider, if, necessary, the, patient, may, be, sent, to, a, medical, specialist, for, further, more, detailed, examinations, the, term, is, generally, not, meant, to, include, visits, for, the, purpose, of, newborn, checks, pap, smears, for, cervical, cancer, or, regular, visits, for, people, with, certain, chronic, medical, disorders, for, example, diabetes, the, general, medical, examination, generally, involves, a, medical, history, a, brief, or, complete, physical, examination, and, sometimes, laboratory, tests, some, more, advanced, tests, include, ultrasound, and, mammography, if, done, for, a, group, of, people, the, routine, physical, is, a, form, of, screening, as, the, aim, of, the, examination, is, to, detect, early, signs, of, diseases, to, prevent, them, although, annual, medical, examinations, are, a, routine, practice, in, several, countries, examinations, performed, on, an, asymptomatic, patient, are, poorly, supported, by, scientific, evidence, in, the, majority, of, the, population, a, cochrane, collaboration, meta, study, found, that, routine, annual, physicals, did, not, measurably, reduce, the, risk, of, illness, or, death, and, conversely, could, lead, to, overdiagnosis, and, over, treatment, however, this, article, does, not, conclude, that, being, in, regular, communication, with, a, doctor, is, not, important, simply, that, an, actual, physical, examination, may, not, be, necessary, some, notable, general, health, organisations, recommend, against, annual, examinations, and, propose, a, frequency, adapted, to, age, and, previous, examination, results, risk, factors, the, specialist, american, cancer, society, recommends, a, cancer, related, health, check, up, annually, in, men, and, women, older, than, 40, and, every, three, years, for, those, older, than, 20, a, systematic, review, of, studies, until, september, 2006, concluded, that, the, examination, does, result, in, better, delivery, of, some, other, screening, interventions, such, as, pap, smears, cholesterol, screening, and, faecal, occult, blood, tests, and, less, patient, worry, evidence, supports, several, of, these, individual, screening, interventions, the, effects, of, annual, check, ups, on, overall, costs, patient, disability, and, mortality, disease, detection, and, intermediate, end, points, such, a, blood, pressure, or, cholesterol, are, inconclusive, a, recent, study, found, that, the, examination, is, associated, with, increased, participation, in, cancer, screening, some, employers, require, a, mandatory, health, checkup, before, hiring, a, candidate, even, though, it, is, now, well, known, that, some, of, the, components, of, the, prophylactic, annual, visit, may, actually, cause, harm, for, example, lab, tests, and, exams, that, are, performed, on, healthy, patients, as, opposed, to, people, with, symptoms, or, known, illnesses, are, statistically, more, likely, to, be, false, positives, that, is, when, test, results, suggest, a, problem, that, does, not, exist, disadvantages, cited, include, the, time, and, money, that, could, be, saved, by, targeted, screening, health, economics, argument, increased, anxiety, over, health, risks, medicalisation, overdiagnosis, wrong, diagnosis, for, example, athletic, heart, syndrome, misdiagnosed, as, hypertrophic, cardiomyopathy, and, harm, or, even, death, resulting, from, unnecessary, testing, to, detect, or, confirm, often, non, existent, medical, problems, or, while, performing, routine, procedures, as, a, followup, after, screening, the, lack, of, good, evidence, contrasts, with, population, surveys, showing, that, the, general, public, is, fond, of, these, examinations, especially, when, they, are, free, of, charge, despite, guidelines, recommending, against, routine, annual, examinations, many, family, physicians, perform, them, a, fee, for, service, healthcare, system, has, been, suggested, to, promote, this, practice, an, alternative, would, be, to, tailor, the, screening, interval, to, the, age, sex, medical, conditions, and, risk, factors, of, each, patient, this, means, choosing, between, a, wide, variety, of, tests, the, routine, physical, is, commonly, performed, in, the, united, states, and, japan, whereas, the, practice, varies, among, south, east, asia, and, mainland, european, countries, in, japan, it, is, required, by, law, for, regular, working, employees, to, have, a, health, check, once, a, year, the, roots, of, the, periodic, medical, examination, are, not, entirely, clear, they, have, been, referenced, as, early, as, 1671, they, have, also, been, advocated, for, since, the, 1920s, some, authors, point, to, pleads, from, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, for, the, early, detection, of, diseases, like, tuberculosis, and, periodic, school, health, examinations, the, advent, of, medical, insurance, and, related, commercial, influences, seems, to, have, promoted, the, examination, whereas, this, practice, has, been, subject, to, controversy, in, the, age, of, evidence, based, medicine, several, studies, have, been, performed, before, current, evidence, based, recommendation, for, screening, were, formulated, limiting, the, applicability, of, these, studies, to, current, day, practice, comprehensive, physical, exams, also, known, as, executive, physicals, typically, include, laboratory, tests, chest, x, rays, pulmonary, function, testing, audiograms, full, body, cat, scanning, ekgs, heart, stress, tests, vascular, age, tests, urinalysis, and, mammograms, or, prostate, exams, depending, on, gender, pre, employment, examinations, are, screening, tests, which, judge, the, suitability, of, a, worker, for, hire, based, on, the, results, of, their, physical, examination, this, is, also, called, pre, employment, medical, clearance, some, employers, believe, that, by, only, hiring, workers, whose, physical, examination, results, pass, certain, exclusionary, criteria, their, employees, collectively, will, have, fewer, absences, due, to, sickness, fewer, workplace, injuries, and, less, occupational, disease, a, small, amount, of, low, quality, evidence, in, medical, research, supports, this, idea, furthermore, the, cost, of, staff, health, insurance, will, be, lower, however, certain, exams, or, tests, that, are, requested, by, employers, such, as, a, baseline, low, back, x, ray, should, not, be, performed, according, to, the, american, college, of, occupational, and, environmental, medicine, reasons, for, this, include, the, legality, and, medical, necessity, of, the, test, as, well, as, the, inability, of, such, testing, to, predict, future, problems, the, radiation, exposure, to, the, worker, and, the, cost, of, the, exam, a, physical, examination, may, be, provided, under, health, insurance, cover, required, of, new, insurance, customers, this, is, a, part, of, insurance, medicine, in, the, united, states, physicals, are, also, marketed, to, patients, as, a, one, stop, health, review, avoiding, the, inconvenience, of, attending, multiple, appointments, with, different, healthcare, providers, physical, examinations, are, performed, in, most, healthcare, encounters, for, example, a, physical, examination, is, performed, when, a, patient, visits, complaining, of, flu, like, symptoms, these, diagnostic, examinations, usually, focus, on, the, patient, s, chief, complaint, general, health, checks, including, physical, examinations, performed, when, the, patient, reported, no, health, concerns, often, include, medical, screening, for, common, conditions, such, as, high, blood, pressure, a, cochrane, review, found, that, general, health, checks, did, not, reduce, the, risk, of, death, from, cancer, heart, disease, or, any, other, cause, and, could, not, be, proved, to, affect, the, patient, s, likelihood, of, being, admitted, to, the, hospital, becoming, disabled, missing, work, or, needing, additional, office, visits, the, study, found, no, effect, on, the, risk, of, illness, but, did, find, evidence, suggesting, that, patients, subject, to, routine, physicals, were, diagnosed, with, hypertension, and, other, chronic, conditions, at, a, higher, rate, than, those, who, were, not, its, authors, noted, that, studies, often, failed, to, consider, or, report, possible, harmful, outcomes, such, as, unwarranted, anxiety, or, unnecessary, follow, up, procedures, and, concluded, that, routine, health, checks, were, unlikely, to, be, beneficial, in, regards, to, lowering, cardiovascular, and, cancer, morbidity, and, mortality, physical, examination, has, been, described, as, a, ritual, that, plays, a, significant, role, in, the, doctor, patient, relationship, that, will, provide, benefits, in, other, medical, encounters, when, a, physical, exam, is, expected, by, the, patient, but, is, not, performed, by, the, provider, patients, may, express, concern, for, the, lack, of, depth, of, investigation, into, their, illness, the, validity, of, treatment, plans, and, exclusions, and, the, doctor, patient, relationship, by, extension, the, term, health, check, is, also, used, for, routing, checks, on, the, working, of, equipment, or, business, operations, or, solvency, a, physical, examination, may, include, checking, vital, signs, including, temperature, examination, blood, pressure, pulse, and, respiratory, rate, the, healthcare, provider, uses, the, senses, of, sight, hearing, touch, and, sometimes, smell, e, g, in, infection, uremia, diabetic, ketoacidosis, taste, has, been, made, redundant, by, the, availability, of, modern, lab, tests, four, actions, are, taught, as, the, basis, of, physical, examination, inspection, palpation, feel, percussion, tap, to, determine, resonance, characteristics, and, auscultation, listen, although, providers, have, varying, approaches, as, to, the, sequence, of, body, parts, a, systematic, examination, generally, starts, at, the, head, and, finishes, at, the, extremities, and, includes, evaluation, of, general, patient, appearance, and, specific, organ, systems, after, the, main, organ, systems, have, been, investigated, by, inspection, palpation, percussion, and, auscultation, specific, tests, may, follow, such, as, a, neurological, investigation, orthopedic, examination, or, specific, tests, when, a, particular, disease, is, suspected, e, g, eliciting, trousseau, s, sign, in, hypocalcemia, while, the, format, of, examination, as, listed, below, is, largely, as, taught, and, expected, of, students, a, specialist, will, focus, on, their, particular, field, and, the, nature, of, the, problem, described, by, the, patient, hence, a, cardiologist, will, not, in, routine, practice, undertake, neurological, parts, of, the, examination, other, than, noting, that, the, patient, is, able, to, use, all, four, limbs, on, entering, the, consultation, room, and, during, the, consultation, become, aware, of, their, hearing, eyesight, and, speech, likewise, an, orthopaedic, surgeon, will, examine, the, affected, joint, but, may, only, briefly, check, the, heart, sounds, and, chest, to, ensure, that, there, is, not, likely, to, be, any, contraindication, to, surgery, raised, by, the, anaesthetist, a, primary, care, physician, will, also, generally, examine, the, male, genitals, but, may, leave, the, examination, of, the, female, genitalia, to, a, gynecologist, with, the, clues, obtained, during, the, history, and, physical, examination, the, healthcare, provider, can, now, formulate, a, differential, diagnosis, a, list, of, potential, causes, of, the, symptoms, specific, diagnostic, tests, or, occasionally, empirical, therapy, generally, confirm, the, cause, or, shed, light, on, other, previously, overlooked, causes, the, physical, exam, is, then, recorded, in, the, medical, record, in, a, standard, layout, which, facilitates, billing, and, other, providers, later, reading, the, notes, while, elective, physical, exams, have, become, more, elaborate, in, routine, use, physical, exams, have, become, less, complete, this, has, led, to, editorials, in, medical, journals, about, the, importance, of, an, adequate, physical, examination, physicians, at, stanford, university, medical, school, have, introduced, a, set, of, 25, key, physical, examination, skills, that, were, felt, to, be, useful, depending, upon, the, chief, complaint, additional, sections, may, be, included, for, example, hearing, may, be, evaluated, with, a, specific, weber, test, and, rinne, test, or, it, may, be, more, briefly, addressed, in, a, cranial, nerve, exam, to, give, another, example, a, neurological, related, complaint, might, be, evaluated, with, a, specific, test, such, as, the, romberg, maneuver, the, old, testament, makes, provision, for, persons, in, the, israelite, community, with, leprosy, to, be, examined, by, a, priest, if, the, presenting, sore, was, white, and, appeared, to, go, beyond, the, depth, of, the, skin, it, was, to, be, treated, as, a, ritually, defiling, condition, a, further, examination, was, to, take, place, seven, days, later, the, medical, history, and, physical, examination, were, supremely, important, to, diagnosis, before, advanced, health, technology, was, developed, and, even, today, despite, advances, in, medical, imaging, and, molecular, medical, tests, the, history, and, physical, remain, indispensable, steps, in, evaluating, any, patient, before, the, 19th, century, the, history, and, physical, examination, were, nearly, the, only, diagnostic, tools, the, physician, had, which, explains, why, tactile, skill, and, ingenious, appreciation, in, the, exam, were, so, highly, valued, in, the, definition, of, what, made, for, a, good, physician, even, as, late, as, 1890, the, world, had, no, radiography, or, fluoroscopy, only, early, and, limited, forms, of, electrophysiologic, testing, and, no, molecular, biology, as, we, know, it, today, ever, since, this, peak, of, the, importance, of, the, physical, examination, reviewers, have, warned, that, clinical, practice, and, medical, education, need, to, remain, vigilant, in, appreciating, the, continuing, need, for, physical, examination, and, effectively, teaching, the, skills, to, perform, it, this, call, is, ongoing, as, the, 21st, century, literature, shows, people, may, request, modesty, in, medical, settings, when, the, health, care, provider, examines, them, in, many, western, societies, a, physical, exam, is, required, to, participate, in, extracurricular, sporting, activities, during, the, physical, examination, the, doctor, will, examine, the, genitals, including, the, penis, and, testicles, the, doctor, may, ask, the, teenager, to, cough, while, examining, the, scrotum, although, this, can, be, embarrassing, for, an, adolescent, male, it, is, necessary, to, help, evaluate, the, presence, of, inguinal, hernias, or, tumors
