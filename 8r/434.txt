springtails, collembola, form, the, largest, of, the, three, lineages, of, modern, hexapods, that, are, no, longer, considered, insects, the, other, two, are, the, protura, and, diplura, although, the, three, orders, are, sometimes, grouped, together, in, a, class, called, entognatha, because, they, have, internal, mouthparts, they, do, not, appear, to, be, any, more, closely, related, to, one, another, than, they, are, to, all, insects, which, have, external, mouthparts, collembolans, are, omnivorous, free, living, organisms, that, prefer, moist, conditions, they, do, not, directly, engage, in, the, decomposition, of, organic, matter, but, contribute, to, it, indirectly, through, the, fragmentation, of, organic, matter, and, the, control, of, soil, microbial, communities, the, word, collembola, is, from, the, ancient, greek, k, lla, glue, and, mbolos, peg, this, name, was, given, due, to, the, existence, of, the, collophore, which, was, previously, thought, to, stick, to, surfaces, to, stabilize, the, creature, early, dna, sequence, studies, suggested, that, collembola, represent, a, separate, evolutionary, line, from, the, other, hexapoda, but, others, disagree, this, seems, to, be, caused, by, widely, divergent, patterns, of, molecular, evolution, among, the, arthropods, the, adjustments, of, traditional, taxonomic, rank, for, springtails, reflect, the, occasional, incompatibility, of, traditional, groupings, with, modern, cladistics, when, they, were, included, with, the, insects, they, were, ranked, as, an, order, as, part, of, the, entognatha, they, are, ranked, as, a, subclass, if, they, are, considered, a, basal, lineage, of, hexapoda, they, are, elevated, to, full, class, status, members, of, the, collembola, are, normally, less, than, 6, mm, 0, 24, in, long, have, six, or, fewer, abdominal, segments, and, possess, a, tubular, appendage, the, collophore, or, ventral, tube, with, reversible, sticky, vesicles, projecting, ventrally, from, the, first, abdominal, segment, it, is, believed, to, be, associated, with, fluid, uptake, and, balance, excretion, and, orientation, of, the, organism, itself, most, species, have, an, abdominal, tail, like, appendage, known, as, a, furcula, or, furca, it, is, located, on, the, fourth, abdominal, segment, of, collembolans, and, is, folded, beneath, the, body, held, under, tension, by, a, small, structure, called, the, retinaculum, or, tenaculum, when, released, it, snaps, against, the, substrate, flinging, the, springtail, into, the, air, and, allowing, for, rapid, evasion, and, travel, all, of, this, takes, place, in, as, little, as, 18, milliseconds, springtails, also, possess, the, ability, to, reduce, their, body, size, by, as, much, as, 30, through, subsequent, ecdyses, moulting, if, temperatures, rise, high, enough, the, shrinkage, is, genetically, controlled, since, warmer, conditions, increase, metabolic, rates, and, energy, requirements, in, organisms, the, reduction, in, body, size, is, advantageous, to, their, survival, the, poduromorpha, and, entomobryomorpha, have, an, elongated, body, while, the, symphypleona, and, neelipleona, have, a, globular, body, collembola, lack, a, tracheal, respiration, system, which, forces, them, to, respire, through, a, porous, cuticle, except, for, the, two, families, sminthuridae, and, actaletidae, which, exhibit, a, single, pair, of, spiracles, between, the, head, and, the, thorax, leading, to, a, rudimentary, although, fully, functional, tracheal, system, the, anatomical, variance, present, between, different, species, partially, depends, on, soil, morphology, and, composition, surface, dwellers, are, generally, larger, have, darker, pigments, have, longer, antennae, and, functioning, furcula, sub, surface, dwellers, are, usually, unpigmented, have, elongated, bodies, and, reduced, furcula, they, can, be, categorized, into, four, main, forms, according, to, soil, composition, and, depth, atmobiotic, epedaphic, hemiedaphic, and, euedaphic, atmobiotic, species, inhabit, macrophytes, and, litter, surfaces, they, are, generally, 8, 10, millimeters, about, in, length, pigmented, have, long, limbs, and, a, full, set, of, ocelli, photoreceptors, epedaphic, species, inhabit, upper, litter, layers, and, fallen, logs, they, are, slightly, smaller, and, have, less, pronounced, pigments, as, well, as, less, developed, limbs, and, ocelli, than, the, atmobiotic, species, hemiedaphic, species, inhabit, the, lower, litter, layers, of, decomposing, organic, material, they, are, 1, 2, millimeters, about, 1, 16, in, length, have, dispersed, pigmentation, shortened, limbs, and, a, reduced, number, of, ocelli, euedaphic, species, inhabit, upper, mineral, layers, known, as, the, humus, horizon, they, are, smaller, than, hemiedaphic, species, have, soft, elongated, bodies, lack, pigmentation, and, ocelli, and, have, reduced, or, absent, furca, poduromorphs, are, characterized, by, their, elongated, bodies, and, conspicuous, segmentation, three, thoracic, segments, six, abdominal, segments, including, a, well, developed, prothorax, with, tergal, chaetae, while, the, first, thoracic, segment, in, entomobryomorpha, is, clearly, reduced, and, bears, no, chaetae, the, digestive, tract, of, collembolan, species, consists, of, three, main, components, the, foregut, midgut, and, hindgut, the, midgut, is, surrounded, by, a, network, of, muscles, and, lined, with, a, monolayer, of, columnar, or, cuboidal, cells, its, function, is, to, mix, and, transport, food, from, the, lumen, into, the, hindgut, through, contraction, many, species, of, syntrophic, bacteria, archaea, and, fungi, are, present, in, the, lumen, these, different, digestive, regions, have, varying, ph, to, support, specific, enzymatic, activities, and, microbial, populations, the, anterior, portion, of, the, midgut, and, hindgut, is, slightly, acidic, with, a, ph, of, approximately, 6, 0, while, the, posterior, midgut, portion, is, slightly, alkaline, with, a, ph, of, approximately, 8, 0, between, the, midgut, and, hindgut, is, an, alimentary, canal, called, the, pyloric, region, which, is, a, muscular, sphincter, malpighian, tubules, are, absent, traditionally, the, springtails, were, divided, into, the, orders, arthropleona, symphypleona, and, occasionally, also, neelipleona, the, arthropleona, were, divided, into, two, superfamilies, the, entomobryoidea, and, the, poduroidea, however, recent, phylogenetic, studies, show, arthropleona, is, paraphyletic, thus, the, arthropleona, are, abolished, in, modern, classifications, and, their, superfamilies, are, raised, in, rank, accordingly, being, now, orders, entomobryomorpha, and, the, poduromorpha, technically, the, arthropleona, are, thus, a, partial, junior, synonym, of, the, collembola, the, term, neopleona, is, essentially, synonymous, with, symphypleona, neelipleona, the, neelipleona, was, originally, seen, as, a, particularly, advanced, lineage, of, symphypleona, based, on, the, shared, global, body, shape, but, the, global, body, of, the, neelipleona, is, realized, in, a, completely, different, way, than, in, symphypleona, subsequently, the, neelipleona, were, considered, as, being, derived, from, the, entomobryomorpha, analysis, of, 18s, and, 28s, rrna, sequence, data, though, suggests, that, they, form, the, most, ancient, lineage, of, springtails, which, would, explain, their, peculiar, apomorphies, this, phylogenetic, relationship, was, also, confirmed, using, a, phylogeny, based, on, mtdna, and, whole, genome, data, the, latest, whole, genome, phylogeny, supporting, four, orders, of, collembola, neelipleona, poduromorpha, symphypleona, entomobryomorpha, springtails, are, attested, to, since, the, early, devonian, the, fossil, from, 400, million, years, ago, rhyniella, praecursor, is, the, oldest, terrestrial, arthropod, and, was, found, in, the, famous, rhynie, chert, of, scotland, given, its, morphology, resembles, extant, species, quite, closely, the, radiation, of, the, hexapoda, can, be, situated, in, the, silurian, 420, million, years, ago, or, more, additional, research, concerning, the, coprolites, fossilized, feces, of, ancient, collembolans, allowed, researchers, to, track, their, lineages, back, some, 412, million, years, fossil, collembola, are, rare, instead, most, are, found, in, amber, even, these, are, rare, and, many, amber, deposits, carry, few, or, no, collembola, the, best, deposits, are, from, the, early, eocene, of, canada, and, europe, miocene, of, central, america, and, the, mid, cretaceous, of, burma, and, canada, they, display, some, unexplained, characteristics, first, all, but, one, of, the, fossils, from, the, cretaceous, belong, to, extinct, genera, whereas, none, of, the, specimens, from, the, eocene, or, the, miocene, are, of, extinct, genera, second, the, species, from, burma, are, more, similar, to, the, modern, fauna, of, canada, than, are, the, canadian, cretaceous, specimens, there, are, about, 3, 600, different, species, specific, feeding, strategies, and, mechanisms, are, employed, to, match, specific, niches, herbivorous, and, detritivorous, species, fragment, biological, material, present, in, soil, and, leaf, litter, supporting, decomposition, and, increasing, the, availability, of, nutrients, for, various, species, of, microbes, and, fungi, carnivorous, species, maintain, populations, of, small, invertebrates, such, as, nematodes, rotifers, and, other, collembolan, species, springtails, commonly, consume, fungal, hyphae, and, spores, but, also, have, been, found, to, consume, plant, material, and, pollen, animal, remains, colloidal, materials, minerals, and, bacteria, springtails, are, consumed, by, mesostigmatan, mites, in, various, families, including, ascidae, laelapidae, parasitidae, rhodacaridae, and, veigaiidae, cave, dwelling, springtails, are, a, food, source, for, spiders, and, harvestmen, in, the, same, environment, such, as, the, endangered, harvestman, texella, reyesi, to, protect, themselves, some, species, have, evolved, chemical, defenses, springtails, are, cryptozoa, frequently, found, in, leaf, litter, and, other, decaying, material, where, they, are, primarily, detritivores, and, microbivores, and, one, of, the, main, biological, agents, responsible, for, the, control, and, the, dissemination, of, soil, microorganisms, in, a, mature, deciduous, woodland, in, temperate, climate, leaf, litter, and, vegetation, typically, support, 30, to, 40, species, of, springtails, and, in, the, tropics, the, number, may, be, over, 100, in, sheer, numbers, they, are, reputed, to, be, one, of, the, most, abundant, of, all, macroscopic, animals, with, estimates, of, 100, 000, individuals, per, square, meter, of, ground, essentially, everywhere, on, earth, where, soil, and, related, habitats, moss, cushions, fallen, wood, grass, tufts, ant, and, termite, nests, occur, only, nematodes, crustaceans, and, mites, are, likely, to, have, global, populations, of, similar, magnitude, and, each, of, those, groups, except, mites, is, more, inclusive, though, taxonomic, rank, cannot, be, used, for, absolute, comparisons, it, is, notable, that, nematodes, are, a, phylum, and, crustaceans, a, subphylum, most, springtails, are, small, and, difficult, to, see, by, casual, observation, but, one, springtail, the, so, called, snow, flea, hypogastrura, nivicola, is, readily, observed, on, warm, winter, days, when, it, is, active, and, its, dark, color, contrasts, sharply, with, a, background, of, snow, in, addition, a, few, species, routinely, climb, trees, and, form, a, dominant, component, of, canopy, fauna, where, they, may, be, collected, by, beating, or, insecticide, fogging, these, tend, to, be, the, larger, 2, mm, species, mainly, in, the, genera, entomobrya, and, orchesella, though, the, densities, on, a, per, square, meter, basis, are, typically, 1, 2, orders, of, magnitude, lower, than, soil, populations, of, the, same, species, in, temperate, regions, a, few, species, e, g, anurophorus, spp, entomobrya, albocincta, xenylla, xavieri, hypogastrura, arborea, are, almost, exclusively, arboreal, in, tropical, regions, a, single, square, meter, of, canopy, habitat, can, support, many, species, of, collembola, the, main, ecological, factor, driving, the, local, distribution, of, species, is, the, vertical, stratification, of, the, environment, in, woodland, a, continuous, change, in, species, assemblages, can, be, observed, from, tree, canopies, to, ground, vegetation, then, to, plant, litter, down, to, deeper, soil, horizons, this, is, a, complex, factor, embracing, both, nutritional, and, physiological, requirements, together, with, behavioural, trends, dispersal, limitation, and, probable, species, interactions, some, species, have, been, shown, to, exhibit, negative, or, positive, gravitropism, which, adds, a, behavioural, dimension, to, this, still, poorly, understood, vertical, segregation, experiments, with, peat, samples, turned, upside, down, showed, two, types, of, responses, to, disturbance, of, this, vertical, gradient, called, stayers, and, movers, as, a, group, springtails, are, highly, sensitive, to, desiccation, because, of, their, tegumentary, respiration, although, some, species, with, thin, permeable, cuticles, have, been, shown, to, resist, severe, drought, by, regulating, the, osmotic, pressure, of, their, body, fluid, the, gregarious, behaviour, of, collembola, mostly, driven, by, the, attractive, power, of, pheromones, excreted, by, adults, gives, more, chance, to, every, juvenile, or, adult, individual, to, find, suitable, better, protected, places, where, desiccation, could, be, avoided, and, reproduction, and, survival, rates, thereby, fitness, could, be, kept, at, an, optimum, sensitivity, to, drought, varies, from, species, to, species, and, increases, during, ecdysis, given, that, springtails, moult, repeatedly, during, their, entire, life, an, ancestral, character, in, hexapoda, they, spend, much, time, in, concealed, micro, sites, where, they, can, find, protection, against, desiccation, and, predation, during, ecdysis, an, advantage, reinforced, by, synchronized, moulting, the, high, humidity, environment, of, many, caves, also, favours, springtails, and, there, are, numerous, cave, adapted, species, including, one, plutomurus, ortobalaganensis, living, 1, 980, metres, 6, 500, ft, down, the, krubera, cave, the, horizontal, distribution, of, springtail, species, is, affected, by, environmental, factors, which, act, at, the, landscape, scale, such, as, soil, acidity, moisture, and, light, requirements, for, ph, can, be, reconstructed, experimentally, altitudinal, changes, in, species, distribution, can, be, at, least, partly, explained, by, increased, acidity, at, higher, elevation, moisture, requirements, among, other, ecological, and, behavioural, factors, explain, why, some, species, cannot, live, aboveground, or, retreat, in, the, soil, during, dry, seasons, but, also, why, some, epigeal, springtails, are, always, found, in, the, vicinity, of, ponds, and, lakes, such, as, the, hygrophilous, isotomurus, palustris, adaptive, features, such, as, the, presence, of, a, fan, like, wettable, mucro, allow, some, species, to, move, at, the, surface, of, water, in, freshwater, and, marine, environments, podura, aquatica, a, unique, representative, of, the, family, poduridae, and, one, of, the, first, springtails, to, have, been, described, by, carl, linnaeus, spends, its, entire, life, at, the, surface, of, water, its, wettable, eggs, dropping, in, water, until, the, non, wettable, first, instar, hatches, then, surfaces, a, few, genera, are, capable, of, being, submerged, and, after, molting, young, springtails, lose, their, water, repellent, properties, and, are, able, to, survive, submerged, under, water, in, a, variegated, landscape, made, of, a, patchwork, of, closed, woodland, and, open, meadows, cereal, crops, environments, most, soil, dwelling, species, are, not, specialized, and, can, be, found, everywhere, but, most, epigeal, and, litter, dwelling, species, are, attracted, to, a, particular, environment, either, forested, or, not, as, a, consequence, of, dispersal, limitation, landuse, change, when, too, rapid, may, cause, the, local, disappearance, of, slow, moving, specialist, species, a, phenomenon, the, measure, of, which, has, been, called, colonisation, credit, springtails, are, well, known, as, pests, of, some, agricultural, crops, sminthurus, viridis, the, lucerne, flea, has, been, shown, to, cause, severe, damage, to, agricultural, crops, and, is, considered, as, a, pest, in, australia, onychiuridae, are, also, known, to, feed, on, tubers, and, to, damage, them, to, some, extent, however, by, their, capacity, to, carry, spores, of, mycorrhizal, fungi, and, mycorrhiza, helper, bacteria, on, their, tegument, soil, springtails, play, a, positive, role, in, the, establishment, of, plant, fungal, symbioses, and, thus, are, beneficial, to, agriculture, they, also, contribute, to, controlling, plant, fungal, diseases, through, their, active, consumption, of, mycelia, and, spores, of, damping, off, and, pathogenic, fungi, it, has, been, suggested, that, they, could, be, reared, to, be, used, for, the, control, of, pathogenic, fungi, in, greenhouses, and, other, indoor, cultures, various, sources, and, publications, have, suggested, that, some, springtails, may, parasitize, humans, but, this, is, entirely, inconsistent, with, their, biology, and, no, such, phenomenon, has, ever, been, scientifically, confirmed, though, it, has, been, documented, that, the, scales, or, hairs, from, collembolans, can, cause, irritation, when, rubbed, onto, the, skin, they, may, sometimes, be, abundant, indoors, in, damp, places, such, as, bathrooms, and, basements, and, incidentally, found, on, one, s, person, more, often, claims, of, persistent, human, skin, infection, by, springtails, may, indicate, a, neurological, problem, such, as, delusional, parasitosis, a, psychological, rather, than, entomological, problem, researchers, themselves, may, be, subject, to, psychological, phenomena, for, example, a, publication, in, 2004, claiming, that, springtails, had, been, found, in, skin, samples, was, later, determined, to, be, a, case, of, pareidolia, that, is, no, springtail, specimens, were, actually, recovered, but, the, researchers, had, digitally, enhanced, photos, of, sample, debris, to, create, images, resembling, small, arthropod, heads, which, then, were, claimed, to, be, springtail, remnants, however, steve, hopkin, reports, one, instance, of, an, entomologist, aspirating, an, isotoma, species, and, in, the, process, accidentally, inhaling, some, of, their, eggs, which, hatched, in, his, nasal, cavity, and, made, him, quite, ill, until, they, were, flushed, out, in, 1952, china, accused, the, united, states, military, of, spreading, bacteria, laden, insects, and, other, objects, during, the, korean, war, by, dropping, them, from, p, 51, fighters, above, rebel, villages, over, north, korea, in, all, the, u, s, was, accused, of, dropping, ants, beetles, crickets, fleas, flies, grasshoppers, lice, springtails, and, stoneflies, as, part, of, a, biological, warfare, effort, the, alleged, associated, diseases, included, anthrax, cholera, dysentery, fowl, septicemia, paratyphoid, plague, scrub, typhus, small, pox, and, typhoid, china, created, an, international, scientific, commission, for, investigating, possible, bacterial, warfare, eventually, ruling, that, the, united, states, probably, did, engage, in, limited, biological, warfare, in, korea, the, us, government, denied, all, the, allegations, and, instead, proposed, that, the, united, nations, send, a, formal, inquiry, committee, to, china, and, korea, but, china, and, korea, refused, to, cooperate, u, s, and, canadian, entomologists, further, claimed, that, the, accusations, were, ridiculous, and, argued, that, anomalous, appearances, of, insects, could, be, explained, through, natural, phenomena, springtail, species, cited, in, allegations, of, biological, warfare, in, the, korean, war, were, isotoma, desoria, negishina, a, local, species, and, the, white, rat, springtail, folsomia, candida, captive, springtails, are, often, kept, in, a, terrarium, as, part, of, a, clean, up, crew, springtails, are, currently, used, in, laboratory, tests, for, the, early, detection, of, soil, pollution, acute, and, chronic, toxicity, tests, have, been, performed, by, researchers, mostly, using, the, parthenogenetic, isotomid, folsomia, candida, these, tests, have, been, standardized, details, on, a, ringtest, on, the, biology, and, ecotoxicology, of, folsomia, candida, and, comparison, with, the, sexual, nearby, species, folsomia, fimetaria, sometimes, preferred, to, folsomia, candida, are, given, in, a, document, written, by, paul, henning, krogh, care, should, be, taken, that, different, strains, of, the, same, species, may, be, conducive, to, different, results, avoidance, tests, have, been, also, performed, they, have, been, standardized, too, avoidance, tests, are, complementary, to, toxicity, tests, but, they, also, offer, several, advantages, they, are, more, rapid, thus, cheaper, more, sensitive, and, they, are, environmentally, more, reliable, because, in, the, real, world, collembola, move, actively, far, from, pollution, spots, it, may, be, hypothesized, that, the, soil, could, become, locally, depauperated, in, animals, and, thus, improper, to, normal, use, while, below, thresholds, of, toxicity, contrary, to, earthworms, and, like, many, insects, and, molluscs, collembola, are, very, sensitive, to, herbicides, and, thus, are, threatened, in, no, tillage, agriculture, which, makes, a, more, intense, use, of, herbicides, than, conventional, agriculture, the, springtail, folsomia, candida, is, also, becoming, a, genomic, model, organism, for, soil, toxicology, with, microarray, technology, the, expression, of, thousands, of, genes, can, be, measured, in, parallel, the, gene, expression, profiles, of, folsomia, candida, exposed, to, environmental, toxicants, allow, fast, and, sensitive, detection, of, pollution, and, additionally, clarifies, molecular, mechanisms, causing, toxicology, collembola, have, been, found, to, be, useful, as, bio, indicators, of, soil, quality, laboratory, studies, have, been, conducted, that, validated, that, the, jumping, ability, of, springtails, can, be, used, to, evaluate, the, soil, quality, of, cu, and, ni, polluted, sites, in, polar, regions, that, are, expected, to, experience, among, the, most, rapid, impact, from, climate, warming, springtails, have, shown, contrasting, responses, to, warming, in, experimental, warming, studies, there, are, negative, positive, and, neutral, responses, reported, neutral, responses, to, experimental, warming, have, also, been, reported, in, studies, of, non, polar, regions, the, importance, of, soil, moisture, has, been, demonstrated, in, experiments, using, infrared, heating, in, an, alpine, meadow, which, had, a, negative, effect, on, mesofauna, biomass, and, diversity, in, drier, parts, and, a, positive, effect, in, moist, sub, areas, furthermore, a, study, with, 20, years, of, experimental, warming, in, three, contrasting, plant, communities, found, that, small, scale, heterogeneity, may, buffer, springtails, to, potential, climate, warming, sexual, reproduction, occurs, through, the, clustered, or, scattered, deposition, of, spermatophores, by, male, adults, stimulation, of, spermatophore, deposition, by, female, pheromones, has, been, demonstrated, in, sinella, curviseta, mating, behavior, can, be, observed, in, symphypleona, among, symphypleona, males, of, some, sminthuridae, use, a, clasping, organ, located, on, their, antenna, many, collembolan, species, mostly, those, living, in, deeper, soil, horizons, are, parthenogenetic, which, favors, reproduction, to, the, detriment, of, genetic, diversity, and, thereby, to, population, tolerance, of, environmental, hazards, parthenogenesis, also, called, thelytoky, is, under, the, control, of, symbiotic, bacteria, of, the, genus, wolbachia, which, live, reproduce, and, are, carried, in, female, reproductive, organs, and, eggs, of, collembola, feminizing, wolbachia, species, are, widespread, in, arthropods, and, nematodes, where, they, co, evolved, with, most, of, their, lineages
