life, on, earth, life, is, a, quality, that, distinguishes, matter, that, has, biological, processes, such, as, signaling, and, self, sustaining, processes, from, matter, that, does, not, it, is, defined, descriptively, by, the, capacity, for, homeostasis, organisation, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response, to, stimuli, and, reproduction, all, life, over, time, eventually, reaches, a, state, of, death, and, none, is, immortal, many, philosophical, definitions, of, living, systems, have, been, proposed, such, as, self, organizing, systems, viruses, in, particular, make, definition, difficult, as, they, replicate, only, in, host, cells, life, exists, all, over, the, earth, in, air, water, and, soil, with, many, ecosystems, forming, the, biosphere, some, of, these, are, harsh, environments, occupied, only, by, extremophiles, life, has, been, studied, since, ancient, times, with, theories, such, as, empedocles, s, materialism, asserting, that, it, was, composed, of, four, eternal, elements, and, aristotle, s, hylomorphism, asserting, that, living, things, have, souls, and, embody, both, form, and, matter, life, originated, at, least, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, resulting, in, a, universal, common, ancestor, this, evolved, into, all, the, species, that, exist, now, by, way, of, many, extinct, species, some, of, which, have, left, traces, as, fossils, attempts, to, classify, living, things, too, began, with, aristotle, modern, classification, began, with, carl, linnaeus, s, system, of, binomial, nomenclature, in, the, 1740s, living, things, are, composed, of, biochemical, molecules, formed, mainly, from, a, few, core, chemical, elements, all, living, things, contain, two, types, of, large, molecule, proteins, and, nucleic, acids, the, latter, usually, both, dna, and, rna, these, carry, the, information, needed, by, each, species, including, the, instructions, to, make, each, type, of, protein, the, proteins, in, turn, serve, as, the, machinery, which, carries, out, the, many, chemical, processes, of, life, the, cell, is, the, structural, and, functional, unit, of, life, smaller, organisms, including, prokaryotes, bacteria, and, archaea, consist, of, small, single, cells, larger, organisms, mainly, eukaryotes, can, consist, of, single, cells, or, may, be, multicellular, with, more, complex, structure, life, is, only, known, to, exist, on, earth, but, extraterrestrial, life, is, thought, probable, artificial, life, is, being, simulated, and, explored, by, scientists, and, engineers, the, definition, of, life, has, long, been, a, challenge, for, scientists, and, philosophers, this, is, partially, because, life, is, a, process, not, a, substance, this, is, complicated, by, a, lack, of, knowledge, of, the, characteristics, of, living, entities, if, any, that, may, have, developed, outside, earth, philosophical, definitions, of, life, have, also, been, put, forward, with, similar, difficulties, on, how, to, distinguish, living, things, from, the, non, living, legal, definitions, of, life, have, been, debated, though, these, generally, focus, on, the, decision, to, declare, a, human, dead, and, the, legal, ramifications, of, this, decision, at, least, 123, definitions, of, life, have, been, compiled, since, there, is, no, consensus, for, a, definition, of, life, most, current, definitions, in, biology, are, descriptive, life, is, considered, a, characteristic, of, something, that, preserves, furthers, or, reinforces, its, existence, in, the, given, environment, this, implies, all, or, most, of, the, following, traits, from, a, physics, perspective, an, organism, is, a, thermodynamic, system, with, an, organised, molecular, structure, that, can, reproduce, itself, and, evolve, as, survival, dictates, thermodynamically, life, has, been, described, as, an, open, system, which, makes, use, of, gradients, in, its, surroundings, to, create, imperfect, copies, of, itself, another, way, of, putting, this, is, to, define, life, as, a, self, sustained, chemical, system, capable, of, undergoing, darwinian, evolution, a, definition, adopted, by, a, nasa, committee, attempting, to, define, life, for, the, purposes, of, exobiology, based, on, a, suggestion, by, carl, sagan, this, definition, however, has, been, widely, criticised, because, according, to, it, a, single, sexually, reproducing, individual, is, not, alive, as, it, is, incapable, of, evolving, on, its, own, others, take, a, living, systems, theory, viewpoint, that, does, not, necessarily, depend, on, molecular, chemistry, one, systemic, definition, of, life, is, that, living, things, are, self, organizing, and, autopoietic, self, producing, variations, of, this, include, stuart, kauffman, s, definition, as, an, autonomous, agent, or, a, multi, agent, system, capable, of, reproducing, itself, and, of, completing, at, least, one, thermodynamic, work, cycle, this, definition, is, extended, by, the, evolution, of, novel, functions, over, time, death, is, the, termination, of, all, vital, functions, or, life, processes, in, an, organism, or, cell, one, of, the, challenges, in, defining, death, is, in, distinguishing, it, from, life, death, would, seem, to, refer, to, either, the, moment, life, ends, or, when, the, state, that, follows, life, begins, however, determining, when, death, has, occurred, is, difficult, as, cessation, of, life, functions, is, often, not, simultaneous, across, organ, systems, such, determination, therefore, requires, drawing, conceptual, lines, between, life, and, death, this, is, problematic, because, there, is, little, consensus, over, how, to, define, life, the, nature, of, death, has, for, millennia, been, a, central, concern, of, the, world, s, religious, traditions, and, of, philosophical, inquiry, many, religions, maintain, faith, in, either, a, kind, of, afterlife, or, reincarnation, for, the, soul, or, resurrection, of, the, body, at, a, later, date, whether, or, not, viruses, should, be, considered, as, alive, is, controversial, they, are, most, often, considered, as, just, gene, coding, replicators, rather, than, forms, of, life, they, have, been, described, as, organisms, at, the, edge, of, life, because, they, possess, genes, evolve, by, natural, selection, and, replicate, by, making, multiple, copies, of, themselves, through, self, assembly, however, viruses, do, not, metabolise, and, they, require, a, host, cell, to, make, new, products, virus, self, assembly, within, host, cells, has, implications, for, the, study, of, the, origin, of, life, as, it, may, support, the, hypothesis, that, life, could, have, started, as, self, assembling, organic, molecules, some, of, the, earliest, theories, of, life, were, materialist, holding, that, all, that, exists, is, matter, and, that, life, is, merely, a, complex, form, or, arrangement, of, matter, empedocles, 430, bc, argued, that, everything, in, the, universe, is, made, up, of, a, combination, of, four, eternal, elements, or, roots, of, all, earth, water, air, and, fire, all, change, is, explained, by, the, arrangement, and, rearrangement, of, these, four, elements, the, various, forms, of, life, are, caused, by, an, appropriate, mixture, of, elements, democritus, 460, bc, was, an, atomist, he, thought, that, the, essential, characteristic, of, life, was, having, a, soul, psyche, and, that, the, soul, like, everything, else, was, composed, of, fiery, atoms, he, elaborated, on, fire, because, of, the, apparent, connection, between, life, and, heat, and, because, fire, moves, plato, in, contrast, held, that, the, world, was, organised, by, permanent, forms, reflected, imperfectly, in, matter, forms, provided, direction, or, intelligence, explaining, the, regularities, observed, in, the, world, the, mechanistic, materialism, that, originated, in, ancient, greece, was, revived, and, revised, by, the, french, philosopher, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, who, held, that, animals, and, humans, were, assemblages, of, parts, that, together, functioned, as, a, machine, this, idea, was, developed, further, by, julien, offray, de, la, mettrie, 1709, 1750, in, his, book, l, homme, machine, in, the, 19th, century, the, advances, in, cell, theory, in, biological, science, encouraged, this, view, the, evolutionary, theory, of, charles, darwin, 1859, is, a, mechanistic, explanation, for, the, origin, of, species, by, means, of, natural, selection, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, st, phane, leduc, 1853, 1939, promoted, the, idea, that, biological, processes, could, be, understood, in, terms, of, physics, and, chemistry, and, that, their, growth, resembled, that, of, inorganic, crystals, immersed, in, solutions, of, sodium, silicate, his, ideas, set, out, in, his, book, la, biologie, synth, tique, were, widely, dismissed, during, his, lifetime, but, has, incurred, a, resurgence, of, interest, in, the, work, of, russell, barge, and, colleagues, hylomorphism, is, a, theory, first, expressed, by, the, greek, philosopher, aristotle, 322, bc, the, application, of, hylomorphism, to, biology, was, important, to, aristotle, and, biology, is, extensively, covered, in, his, extant, writings, in, this, view, everything, in, the, material, universe, has, both, matter, and, form, and, the, form, of, a, living, thing, is, its, soul, greek, psyche, latin, anima, there, are, three, kinds, of, souls, the, vegetative, soul, of, plants, which, causes, them, to, grow, and, decay, and, nourish, themselves, but, does, not, cause, motion, and, sensation, the, animal, soul, which, causes, animals, to, move, and, feel, and, the, rational, soul, which, is, the, source, of, consciousness, and, reasoning, which, aristotle, believed, is, found, only, in, man, each, higher, soul, has, all, of, the, attributes, of, the, lower, ones, aristotle, believed, that, while, matter, can, exist, without, form, form, cannot, exist, without, matter, and, that, therefore, the, soul, cannot, exist, without, the, body, this, account, is, consistent, with, teleological, explanations, of, life, which, account, for, phenomena, in, terms, of, purpose, or, goal, directedness, thus, the, whiteness, of, the, polar, bear, s, coat, is, explained, by, its, purpose, of, camouflage, the, direction, of, causality, from, the, future, to, the, past, is, in, contradiction, with, the, scientific, evidence, for, natural, selection, which, explains, the, consequence, in, terms, of, a, prior, cause, biological, features, are, explained, not, by, looking, at, future, optimal, results, but, by, looking, at, the, past, evolutionary, history, of, a, species, which, led, to, the, natural, selection, of, the, features, in, question, spontaneous, generation, was, the, belief, that, living, organisms, can, form, without, descent, from, similar, organisms, typically, the, idea, was, that, certain, forms, such, as, fleas, could, arise, from, inanimate, matter, such, as, dust, or, the, supposed, seasonal, generation, of, mice, and, insects, from, mud, or, garbage, the, theory, of, spontaneous, generation, was, proposed, by, aristotle, who, compiled, and, expanded, the, work, of, prior, natural, philosophers, and, the, various, ancient, explanations, of, the, appearance, of, organisms, it, was, considered, the, best, explanation, for, two, millennia, it, was, decisively, dispelled, by, the, experiments, of, louis, pasteur, in, 1859, who, expanded, upon, the, investigations, of, predecessors, such, as, francesco, redi, disproof, of, the, traditional, ideas, of, spontaneous, generation, is, no, longer, controversial, among, biologists, vitalism, is, the, belief, that, there, is, a, non, material, life, principle, this, originated, with, georg, ernst, stahl, 17th, century, and, remained, popular, until, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, it, appealed, to, philosophers, such, as, henri, bergson, friedrich, nietzsche, and, wilhelm, dilthey, anatomists, like, xavier, bichat, and, chemists, like, justus, von, liebig, vitalism, included, the, idea, that, there, was, a, fundamental, difference, between, organic, and, inorganic, material, and, the, belief, that, organic, material, can, only, be, derived, from, living, things, this, was, disproved, in, 1828, when, friedrich, w, hler, prepared, urea, from, inorganic, materials, this, w, hler, synthesis, is, considered, the, starting, point, of, modern, organic, chemistry, it, is, of, historical, significance, because, for, the, first, time, an, organic, compound, was, produced, in, inorganic, reactions, during, the, 1850s, hermann, von, helmholtz, anticipated, by, julius, robert, von, mayer, demonstrated, that, no, energy, is, lost, in, muscle, movement, suggesting, that, there, were, no, vital, forces, necessary, to, move, a, muscle, these, results, led, to, the, abandonment, of, scientific, interest, in, vitalistic, theories, especially, after, eduard, buchner, s, demonstration, that, alcoholic, fermentation, could, occur, in, cell, free, extracts, of, yeast, nonetheless, belief, still, exists, in, pseudoscientific, theories, such, as, homoeopathy, which, interprets, diseases, and, sickness, as, caused, by, disturbances, in, a, hypothetical, vital, force, or, life, force, the, age, of, earth, is, about, 4, 54, billion, years, life, on, earth, has, existed, for, at, least, 3, 5, billion, years, with, the, oldest, physical, traces, of, life, dating, back, 3, 7, billion, years, estimates, from, molecular, clocks, as, summarised, in, the, timetree, public, database, place, the, origin, of, life, around, 4, 0, billion, years, ago, hypotheses, on, the, origin, of, life, attempt, to, explain, the, formation, of, a, universal, common, ancestor, from, simple, organic, molecules, via, pre, cellular, life, to, protocells, and, metabolism, in, 2016, a, set, of, 355, genes, from, the, last, universal, common, ancestor, was, tentatively, identified, the, biosphere, is, postulated, to, have, developed, from, the, origin, of, life, onwards, at, least, some, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, the, earliest, evidence, for, life, on, earth, includes, biogenic, graphite, found, in, 3, 7, billion, year, old, metasedimentary, rocks, from, western, greenland, and, microbial, mat, fossils, found, in, 3, 48, billion, year, old, sandstone, from, western, australia, more, recently, in, 2015, remains, of, biotic, life, were, found, in, 4, 1, billion, year, old, rocks, in, western, australia, in, 2017, putative, fossilised, microorganisms, or, microfossils, were, announced, to, have, been, discovered, in, hydrothermal, vent, precipitates, in, the, nuvvuagittuq, belt, of, quebec, canada, that, were, as, old, as, 4, 28, billion, years, the, oldest, record, of, life, on, earth, suggesting, an, almost, instantaneous, emergence, of, life, after, ocean, formation, 4, 4, billion, years, ago, and, not, long, after, the, formation, of, the, earth, 4, 54, billion, years, ago, evolution, is, the, change, in, heritable, characteristics, of, biological, populations, over, successive, generations, it, results, in, the, appearance, of, new, species, and, often, the, disappearance, of, old, ones, evolution, occurs, when, evolutionary, processes, such, as, natural, selection, including, sexual, selection, and, genetic, drift, act, on, genetic, variation, resulting, in, certain, characteristics, increasing, or, decreasing, in, frequency, within, a, population, over, successive, generations, the, process, of, evolution, has, given, rise, to, biodiversity, at, every, level, of, biological, organisation, fossils, are, the, preserved, remains, or, traces, of, organisms, from, the, remote, past, the, totality, of, fossils, both, discovered, and, undiscovered, and, their, placement, in, layers, strata, of, sedimentary, rock, is, known, as, the, fossil, record, a, preserved, specimen, is, called, a, fossil, if, it, is, older, than, the, arbitrary, date, of, 10, 000, years, ago, hence, fossils, range, in, age, from, the, youngest, at, the, start, of, the, holocene, epoch, to, the, oldest, from, the, archaean, eon, up, to, 3, 4, billion, years, old, extinction, is, the, process, by, which, a, species, dies, out, the, moment, of, extinction, is, the, death, of, the, last, individual, of, that, species, because, a, species, potential, range, may, be, very, large, determining, this, moment, is, difficult, and, is, usually, done, retrospectively, after, a, period, of, apparent, absence, species, become, extinct, when, they, are, no, longer, able, to, survive, in, changing, habitat, or, against, superior, competition, over, 99, of, all, the, species, that, have, ever, lived, are, now, extinct, mass, extinctions, may, have, accelerated, evolution, by, providing, opportunities, for, new, groups, of, organisms, to, diversify, the, diversity, of, life, on, earth, is, a, result, of, the, dynamic, interplay, between, genetic, opportunity, metabolic, capability, environmental, challenges, and, symbiosis, for, most, of, its, existence, earth, s, habitable, environment, has, been, dominated, by, microorganisms, and, subjected, to, their, metabolism, and, evolution, as, a, consequence, of, these, microbial, activities, the, physical, chemical, environment, on, earth, has, been, changing, on, a, geologic, time, scale, thereby, affecting, the, path, of, evolution, of, subsequent, life, for, example, the, release, of, molecular, oxygen, by, cyanobacteria, as, a, by, product, of, photosynthesis, induced, global, changes, in, the, earth, s, environment, because, oxygen, was, toxic, to, most, life, on, earth, at, the, time, this, posed, novel, evolutionary, challenges, and, ultimately, resulted, in, the, formation, of, earth, s, major, animal, and, plant, species, this, interplay, between, organisms, and, their, environment, is, an, inherent, feature, of, living, systems, the, biosphere, is, the, global, sum, of, all, ecosystems, it, can, also, be, termed, as, the, zone, of, life, on, earth, a, closed, system, apart, from, solar, and, cosmic, radiation, and, heat, from, the, interior, of, the, earth, and, largely, self, regulating, organisms, exist, in, every, part, of, the, biosphere, including, soil, hot, springs, inside, rocks, at, least, 19, km, 12, mi, deep, underground, the, deepest, parts, of, the, ocean, and, at, least, 64, km, 40, mi, high, in, the, atmosphere, for, example, spores, of, aspergillus, niger, have, been, detected, in, the, mesosphere, at, an, altitude, of, 48, to, 77, km, under, test, conditions, life, forms, have, been, observed, to, survive, in, the, vacuum, of, space, life, forms, thrive, in, the, deep, mariana, trench, and, inside, rocks, up, to, 580, m, 1, 900, ft, 0, 36, mi, below, the, sea, floor, under, 2, 590, m, 8, 500, ft, 1, 61, mi, of, ocean, off, the, coast, of, the, northwestern, united, states, and, 2, 400, m, 7, 900, ft, 1, 5, mi, beneath, the, seabed, off, japan, in, 2014, life, forms, were, found, living, 800, m, 2, 600, ft, 0, 50, mi, below, the, ice, of, antarctica, expeditions, of, the, international, ocean, discovery, program, found, unicellular, life, in, 120, c, sediment, 1, 2, km, below, seafloor, in, the, nankai, trough, subduction, zone, according, to, one, researcher, you, can, find, microbes, everywhere, they, re, extremely, adaptable, to, conditions, and, survive, wherever, they, are, the, inert, components, of, an, ecosystem, are, the, physical, and, chemical, factors, necessary, for, life, energy, sunlight, or, chemical, energy, water, heat, atmosphere, gravity, nutrients, and, ultraviolet, solar, radiation, protection, in, most, ecosystems, the, conditions, vary, during, the, day, and, from, one, season, to, the, next, to, live, in, most, ecosystems, then, organisms, must, be, able, to, survive, a, range, of, conditions, called, the, range, of, tolerance, outside, that, are, the, zones, of, physiological, stress, where, the, survival, and, reproduction, are, possible, but, not, optimal, beyond, these, zones, are, the, zones, of, intolerance, where, survival, and, reproduction, of, that, organism, is, unlikely, or, impossible, organisms, that, have, a, wide, range, of, tolerance, are, more, widely, distributed, than, organisms, with, a, narrow, range, of, tolerance, to, survive, some, microorganisms, have, evolved, to, withstand, freezing, complete, desiccation, starvation, high, levels, of, radiation, exposure, and, other, physical, or, chemical, challenges, these, extremophile, microorganisms, may, survive, exposure, to, such, conditions, for, long, periods, they, excel, at, exploiting, uncommon, sources, of, energy, characterization, of, the, structure, and, metabolic, diversity, of, microbial, communities, in, such, extreme, environments, is, ongoing, the, first, classification, of, organisms, was, made, by, the, greek, philosopher, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, who, grouped, living, things, as, either, plants, or, animals, based, mainly, on, their, ability, to, move, he, distinguished, animals, with, blood, from, animals, without, blood, which, can, be, compared, with, the, concepts, of, vertebrates, and, invertebrates, respectively, and, divided, the, blooded, animals, into, five, groups, viviparous, quadrupeds, mammals, oviparous, quadrupeds, reptiles, and, amphibians, birds, fishes, and, whales, the, bloodless, animals, were, divided, into, five, groups, cephalopods, crustaceans, insects, which, included, the, spiders, scorpions, and, centipedes, shelled, animals, such, as, most, molluscs, and, echinoderms, and, zoophytes, animals, that, resemble, plants, this, theory, remained, dominant, for, more, than, a, thousand, years, in, the, late, 1740s, carl, linnaeus, introduced, his, system, of, binomial, nomenclature, for, the, classification, of, species, linnaeus, attempted, to, improve, the, composition, and, reduce, the, length, of, the, previously, used, many, worded, names, by, abolishing, unnecessary, rhetoric, introducing, new, descriptive, terms, and, precisely, defining, their, meaning, the, fungi, were, originally, treated, as, plants, for, a, short, period, linnaeus, had, classified, them, in, the, taxon, vermes, in, animalia, but, later, placed, them, back, in, plantae, herbert, copeland, classified, the, fungi, in, his, protoctista, including, them, with, single, celled, organisms, and, thus, partially, avoiding, the, problem, but, acknowledging, their, special, status, the, problem, was, eventually, solved, by, whittaker, when, he, gave, them, their, own, kingdom, in, his, five, kingdom, system, evolutionary, history, shows, that, the, fungi, are, more, closely, related, to, animals, than, to, plants, as, advances, in, microscopy, enabled, detailed, study, of, cells, and, microorganisms, new, groups, of, life, were, revealed, and, the, fields, of, cell, biology, and, microbiology, were, created, these, new, organisms, were, originally, described, separately, in, protozoa, as, animals, and, protophyta, thallophyta, as, plants, but, were, united, by, ernst, haeckel, in, the, kingdom, protista, later, the, prokaryotes, were, split, off, in, the, kingdom, monera, which, would, eventually, be, divided, into, two, separate, groups, the, bacteria, and, the, archaea, this, led, to, the, six, kingdom, system, and, eventually, to, the, current, three, domain, system, which, is, based, on, evolutionary, relationships, however, the, classification, of, eukaryotes, especially, of, protists, is, still, controversial, as, microbiology, developed, viruses, which, are, non, cellular, were, discovered, whether, these, are, considered, alive, has, been, a, matter, of, debate, viruses, lack, characteristics, of, life, such, as, cell, membranes, metabolism, and, the, ability, to, grow, or, respond, to, their, environments, viruses, have, been, classed, into, species, based, on, their, genetics, but, many, aspects, of, such, a, classification, remain, controversial, the, original, linnaean, system, has, been, modified, many, times, for, example, as, follows, the, attempt, to, organise, the, eukaryotes, into, a, small, number, of, kingdoms, has, been, challenged, the, protozoa, do, not, form, a, clade, or, natural, grouping, and, nor, do, the, chromista, chromalveolata, the, ability, to, sequence, large, numbers, of, complete, genomes, has, allowed, biologists, to, take, a, metagenomic, view, of, the, phylogeny, of, the, whole, tree, of, life, this, has, led, to, the, realisation, that, the, majority, of, living, things, are, bacteria, and, that, all, have, a, common, origin, all, life, forms, require, certain, core, chemical, elements, for, their, biochemical, functioning, these, include, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and, sulfur, the, elemental, macronutrients, for, all, organisms, together, these, make, up, nucleic, acids, proteins, and, lipids, the, bulk, of, living, matter, five, of, these, six, elements, comprise, the, chemical, components, of, dna, the, exception, being, sulfur, the, latter, is, a, component, of, the, amino, acids, cysteine, and, methionine, the, most, abundant, of, these, elements, in, organisms, is, carbon, which, has, the, desirable, attribute, of, forming, multiple, stable, covalent, bonds, this, allows, carbon, based, organic, molecules, to, form, the, immense, variety, of, chemical, arrangements, described, in, organic, chemistry, alternative, hypothetical, types, of, biochemistry, have, been, proposed, that, eliminate, one, or, more, of, these, elements, swap, out, an, element, for, one, not, on, the, list, or, change, required, chiralities, or, other, chemical, properties, deoxyribonucleic, acid, or, dna, is, a, molecule, that, carries, most, of, the, genetic, instructions, used, in, the, growth, development, functioning, and, reproduction, of, all, known, living, organisms, and, many, viruses, dna, and, rna, are, nucleic, acids, alongside, proteins, and, complex, carbohydrates, they, are, one, of, the, three, major, types, of, macromolecule, that, are, essential, for, all, known, forms, of, life, most, dna, molecules, consist, of, two, biopolymer, strands, coiled, around, each, other, to, form, a, double, helix, the, two, dna, strands, are, known, as, polynucleotides, since, they, are, composed, of, simpler, units, called, nucleotides, each, nucleotide, is, composed, of, a, nitrogen, containing, nucleobase, either, cytosine, c, guanine, g, adenine, a, or, thymine, t, as, well, as, a, sugar, called, deoxyribose, and, a, phosphate, group, the, nucleotides, are, joined, to, one, another, in, a, chain, by, covalent, bonds, between, the, sugar, of, one, nucleotide, and, the, phosphate, of, the, next, resulting, in, an, alternating, sugar, phosphate, backbone, according, to, base, pairing, rules, a, with, t, and, c, with, g, hydrogen, bonds, bind, the, nitrogenous, bases, of, the, two, separate, polynucleotide, strands, to, make, double, stranded, dna, this, has, the, key, property, that, each, strand, contains, all, the, information, needed, to, recreate, the, other, strand, enabling, the, information, to, be, preserved, during, reproduction, and, cell, division, within, cells, dna, is, organised, into, long, structures, called, chromosomes, during, cell, division, these, chromosomes, are, duplicated, in, the, process, of, dna, replication, providing, each, cell, its, own, complete, set, of, chromosomes, eukaryotes, store, most, of, their, dna, inside, the, cell, nucleus, cells, are, the, basic, unit, of, structure, in, every, living, thing, and, all, cells, arise, from, pre, existing, cells, by, division, cell, theory, was, formulated, by, henri, dutrochet, theodor, schwann, rudolf, virchow, and, others, during, the, early, nineteenth, century, and, subsequently, became, widely, accepted, the, activity, of, an, organism, depends, on, the, total, activity, of, its, cells, with, energy, flow, occurring, within, and, between, them, cells, contain, hereditary, information, that, is, carried, forward, as, a, genetic, code, during, cell, division, there, are, two, primary, types, of, cells, reflecting, their, evolutionary, origins, prokaryote, cells, lack, a, nucleus, and, other, membrane, bound, organelles, although, they, have, circular, dna, and, ribosomes, bacteria, and, archaea, are, two, domains, of, prokaryotes, the, other, primary, type, is, the, eukaryote, cell, which, has, a, distinct, nucleus, bound, by, a, nuclear, membrane, and, membrane, bound, organelles, including, mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, rough, and, smooth, endoplasmic, reticulum, and, vacuoles, in, addition, their, dna, is, organised, into, chromosomes, all, species, of, large, complex, organisms, are, eukaryotes, including, animals, plants, and, fungi, though, with, a, wide, diversity, of, protist, microorganisms, the, conventional, model, is, that, eukaryotes, evolved, from, prokaryotes, with, the, main, organelles, of, the, eukaryotes, forming, through, endosymbiosis, between, bacteria, and, the, progenitor, eukaryotic, cell, the, molecular, mechanisms, of, cell, biology, are, based, on, proteins, most, of, these, are, synthesised, by, the, ribosomes, through, an, enzyme, catalyzed, process, called, protein, biosynthesis, a, sequence, of, amino, acids, is, assembled, and, joined, based, upon, gene, expression, of, the, cell, s, nucleic, acid, in, eukaryotic, cells, these, proteins, may, then, be, transported, and, processed, through, the, golgi, apparatus, in, preparation, for, dispatch, to, their, destination, cells, reproduce, through, a, process, of, cell, division, in, which, the, parent, cell, divides, into, two, or, more, daughter, cells, for, prokaryotes, cell, division, occurs, through, a, process, of, fission, in, which, the, dna, is, replicated, then, the, two, copies, are, attached, to, parts, of, the, cell, membrane, in, eukaryotes, a, more, complex, process, of, mitosis, is, followed, however, the, result, is, the, same, the, resulting, cell, copies, are, identical, to, each, other, and, to, the, original, cell, except, for, mutations, and, both, are, capable, of, further, division, following, an, interphase, period, multicellular, organisms, may, have, first, evolved, through, the, formation, of, colonies, of, identical, cells, these, cells, can, form, group, organisms, through, cell, adhesion, the, individual, members, of, a, colony, are, capable, of, surviving, on, their, own, whereas, the, members, of, a, true, multi, cellular, organism, have, developed, specialisations, making, them, dependent, on, the, remainder, of, the, organism, for, survival, such, organisms, are, formed, clonally, or, from, a, single, germ, cell, that, is, capable, of, forming, the, various, specialised, cells, that, form, the, adult, organism, this, specialisation, allows, multicellular, organisms, to, exploit, resources, more, efficiently, than, single, cells, about, 800, million, years, ago, a, minor, genetic, change, in, a, single, molecule, the, enzyme, gk, pid, may, have, allowed, organisms, to, go, from, a, single, cell, organism, to, one, of, many, cells, cells, have, evolved, methods, to, perceive, and, respond, to, their, microenvironment, thereby, enhancing, their, adaptability, cell, signalling, coordinates, cellular, activities, and, hence, governs, the, basic, functions, of, multicellular, organisms, signaling, between, cells, can, occur, through, direct, cell, contact, using, juxtacrine, signalling, or, indirectly, through, the, exchange, of, agents, as, in, the, endocrine, system, in, more, complex, organisms, coordination, of, activities, can, occur, through, a, dedicated, nervous, system, though, life, is, confirmed, only, on, earth, many, think, that, extraterrestrial, life, is, not, only, plausible, but, probable, or, inevitable, possibly, resulting, in, a, biophysical, cosmology, instead, of, a, mere, physical, cosmology, other, planets, and, moons, in, the, solar, system, and, other, planetary, systems, are, being, examined, for, evidence, of, having, once, supported, simple, life, and, projects, such, as, seti, are, trying, to, detect, radio, transmissions, from, possible, alien, civilisations, other, locations, within, the, solar, system, that, may, host, microbial, life, include, the, subsurface, of, mars, the, upper, atmosphere, of, venus, and, subsurface, oceans, on, some, of, the, moons, of, the, giant, planets, investigation, of, the, tenacity, and, versatility, of, life, on, earth, as, well, as, an, understanding, of, the, molecular, systems, that, some, organisms, utilise, to, survive, such, extremes, is, important, for, the, search, for, extraterrestrial, life, for, example, lichen, could, survive, for, a, month, in, a, simulated, martian, environment, beyond, the, solar, system, the, region, around, another, main, sequence, star, that, could, support, earth, like, life, on, an, earth, like, planet, is, known, as, the, habitable, zone, the, inner, and, outer, radii, of, this, zone, vary, with, the, luminosity, of, the, star, as, does, the, time, interval, during, which, the, zone, survives, stars, more, massive, than, the, sun, have, a, larger, habitable, zone, but, remain, on, the, sun, like, main, sequence, of, stellar, evolution, for, a, shorter, time, interval, small, red, dwarfs, have, the, opposite, problem, with, a, smaller, habitable, zone, that, is, subject, to, higher, levels, of, magnetic, activity, and, the, effects, of, tidal, locking, from, close, orbits, hence, stars, in, the, intermediate, mass, range, such, as, the, sun, may, have, a, greater, likelihood, for, earth, like, life, to, develop, the, location, of, the, star, within, a, galaxy, may, also, affect, the, likelihood, of, life, forming, stars, in, regions, with, a, greater, abundance, of, heavier, elements, that, can, form, planets, in, combination, with, a, low, rate, of, potentially, habitat, damaging, supernova, events, are, predicted, to, have, a, higher, probability, of, hosting, planets, with, complex, life, the, variables, of, the, drake, equation, are, used, to, discuss, the, conditions, in, planetary, systems, where, civilisation, is, most, likely, to, exist, within, wide, bounds, of, uncertainty, a, confidence, of, life, detection, scale, cold, for, reporting, evidence, of, life, beyond, earth, has, been, proposed, artificial, life, is, the, simulation, of, any, aspect, of, life, as, through, computers, robotics, or, biochemistry, synthetic, biology, is, a, new, area, of, biotechnology, that, combines, science, and, biological, engineering, the, common, goal, is, the, design, and, construction, of, new, biological, functions, and, systems, not, found, in, nature, synthetic, biology, includes, the, broad, redefinition, and, expansion, of, biotechnology, with, the, ultimate, goals, of, being, able, to, design, and, build, engineered, biological, systems, that, process, information, manipulate, chemicals, fabricate, materials, and, structures, produce, energy, provide, food, and, maintain, and, enhance, human, health,
