a, sarcomere, greek, sarx, flesh, meros, part, is, the, smallest, functional, unit, of, striated, muscle, tissue, it, is, the, repeating, unit, between, two, z, lines, skeletal, muscles, are, composed, of, tubular, muscle, cells, called, muscle, fibers, or, myofibers, which, are, formed, during, embryonic, myogenesis, muscle, fibers, contain, numerous, tubular, myofibrils, myofibrils, are, composed, of, repeating, sections, of, sarcomeres, which, appear, under, the, microscope, as, alternating, dark, and, light, bands, sarcomeres, are, composed, of, long, fibrous, proteins, as, filaments, that, slide, past, each, other, when, a, muscle, contracts, or, relaxes, the, costamere, is, a, different, component, that, connects, the, sarcomere, to, the, sarcolemma, two, of, the, important, proteins, are, myosin, which, forms, the, thick, filament, and, actin, which, forms, the, thin, filament, myosin, has, a, long, fibrous, tail, and, a, globular, head, that, binds, to, actin, the, myosin, head, also, binds, to, atp, which, is, the, source, of, energy, for, muscle, movement, myosin, can, only, bind, to, actin, when, the, binding, sites, on, actin, are, exposed, by, calcium, ions, actin, molecules, are, bound, to, the, z, line, which, forms, the, borders, of, the, sarcomere, other, bands, appear, when, the, sarcomere, is, relaxed, the, myofibrils, of, smooth, muscle, cells, are, not, arranged, into, sarcomeres, the, sarcomeres, give, skeletal, and, cardiac, muscle, their, striated, appearance, which, was, first, described, by, van, leeuwenhoek, the, relationship, between, the, proteins, and, the, regions, of, the, sarcomere, are, as, follows, the, protein, tropomyosin, covers, the, myosin, binding, sites, of, the, actin, molecules, in, the, muscle, cell, for, a, muscle, cell, to, contract, tropomyosin, must, be, moved, to, uncover, the, binding, sites, on, the, actin, calcium, ions, bind, with, troponin, c, molecules, which, are, dispersed, throughout, the, tropomyosin, protein, and, alter, the, structure, of, the, tropomyosin, forcing, it, to, reveal, the, cross, bridge, binding, site, on, the, actin, the, concentration, of, calcium, within, muscle, cells, is, controlled, by, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, a, unique, form, of, endoplasmic, reticulum, in, the, sarcoplasm, muscle, cells, are, stimulated, when, a, motor, neuron, releases, the, neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which, travels, across, the, neuromuscular, junction, the, synapse, between, the, terminal, button, of, the, neuron, and, the, muscle, cell, acetylcholine, binds, to, a, post, synaptic, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptor, a, change, in, the, receptor, conformation, allows, an, influx, of, sodium, ions, and, initiation, of, a, post, synaptic, action, potential, the, action, potential, then, travels, along, t, tubules, transverse, tubules, until, it, reaches, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, here, the, depolarized, membrane, activates, voltage, gated, l, type, calcium, channels, present, in, the, plasma, membrane, the, l, type, calcium, channels, are, in, close, association, with, ryanodine, receptors, present, on, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, the, inward, flow, of, calcium, from, the, l, type, calcium, channels, activates, ryanodine, receptors, to, release, calcium, ions, from, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, this, mechanism, is, called, calcium, induced, calcium, release, cicr, it, is, not, understood, whether, the, physical, opening, of, the, l, type, calcium, channels, or, the, presence, of, calcium, causes, the, ryanodine, receptors, to, open, the, outflow, of, calcium, allows, the, myosin, heads, access, to, the, actin, cross, bridge, binding, sites, permitting, muscle, contraction, muscle, contraction, ends, when, calcium, ions, are, pumped, back, into, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, allowing, the, contractile, apparatus, and, thus, muscle, cell, to, relax, upon, muscle, contraction, the, a, bands, do, not, change, their, length, 1, 85, micrometer, in, mammalian, skeletal, muscle, whereas, the, i, bands, and, the, h, zone, shorten, this, causes, the, z, lines, to, come, closer, together, at, rest, the, myosin, head, is, bound, to, an, atp, molecule, in, a, low, energy, configuration, and, is, unable, to, access, the, cross, bridge, binding, sites, on, the, actin, however, the, myosin, head, can, hydrolyze, atp, into, adenosine, diphosphate, adp, and, an, inorganic, phosphate, ion, a, portion, of, the, energy, released, in, this, reaction, changes, the, shape, of, the, myosin, head, and, promotes, it, to, a, high, energy, configuration, through, the, process, of, binding, to, the, actin, the, myosin, head, releases, adp, and, an, inorganic, phosphate, ion, changing, its, configuration, back, to, one, of, low, energy, the, myosin, remains, attached, to, actin, in, a, state, known, as, rigor, until, a, new, atp, binds, the, myosin, head, this, binding, of, atp, to, myosin, releases, the, actin, by, cross, bridge, dissociation, the, atp, associated, myosin, is, ready, for, another, cycle, beginning, with, hydrolysis, of, the, atp, the, a, band, is, visible, as, dark, transverse, lines, across, myofibers, the, i, band, is, visible, as, lightly, staining, transverse, lines, and, the, z, line, is, visible, as, dark, lines, separating, sarcomeres, at, the, light, microscope, level, most, muscle, cells, can, only, store, enough, atp, for, a, small, number, of, muscle, contractions, while, muscle, cells, also, store, glycogen, most, of, the, energy, required, for, contraction, is, derived, from, phosphagens, one, such, phosphagen, creatine, phosphate, is, used, to, provide, adp, with, a, phosphate, group, for, atp, synthesis, in, vertebrates, the, structure, of, the, sarcomere, affects, its, function, in, several, ways, the, overlap, of, actin, and, myosin, gives, rise, to, the, length, tension, curve, which, shows, how, sarcomere, force, output, decreases, if, the, muscle, is, stretched, so, that, fewer, cross, bridges, can, form, or, compressed, until, actin, filaments, interfere, with, each, other, length, of, the, actin, and, myosin, filaments, taken, together, as, sarcomere, length, affects, force, and, velocity, longer, sarcomeres, have, more, cross, bridges, and, thus, more, force, but, have, a, reduced, range, of, shortening, vertebrates, display, a, very, limited, range, of, sarcomere, lengths, with, roughly, the, same, optimal, length, length, at, peak, length, tension, in, all, muscles, of, an, individual, as, well, as, between, species, arthropods, however, show, tremendous, variation, over, seven, fold, in, sarcomere, length, both, between, species, and, between, muscles, in, a, single, individual, the, reasons, for, the, lack, of, substantial, sarcomere, variability, in, vertebrates, is, not, fully, known
