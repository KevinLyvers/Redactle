the, world, it, is, a, small, bird, that, has, a, typical, length, of, 16, cm, 6, 3, in, and, a, mass, of, 24, 39, 5, g, 0, 85, 1, 39, oz, females, and, young, birds, are, coloured, pale, brown, and, grey, and, males, have, brighter, black, white, and, brown, markings, one, of, about, 25, species, in, the, genus, passer, the, house, sparrow, is, native, to, most, of, europe, the, mediterranean, basin, and, a, large, part, of, asia, its, intentional, or, accidental, introductions, to, many, regions, including, parts, of, australasia, africa, and, the, americas, make, it, the, most, widely, distributed, wild, bird, the, house, sparrow, is, strongly, associated, with, human, habitation, and, can, live, in, urban, or, rural, settings, though, found, in, widely, varied, habitats, and, climates, it, typically, avoids, extensive, woodlands, grasslands, polar, regions, and, hot, dry, deserts, far, away, from, human, development, for, sustenance, the, house, sparrow, routinely, feeds, at, home, and, public, bird, feeding, stations, but, naturally, feeds, on, the, seeds, of, grains, flowering, plants, and, weeds, however, it, is, an, opportunistic, omnivorous, eater, and, commonly, catches, insects, their, larvae, caterpillars, invertebrates, and, many, other, natural, foods, because, of, its, numbers, ubiquity, and, association, with, human, settlements, the, house, sparrow, is, culturally, prominent, it, is, extensively, and, usually, unsuccessfully, persecuted, as, an, agricultural, pest, it, has, also, often, been, kept, as, a, pet, as, well, as, being, a, food, item, and, a, symbol, of, lust, sexual, potency, commonness, and, vulgarity, though, it, is, widespread, and, abundant, its, numbers, have, declined, in, some, areas, the, animal, s, conservation, status, is, listed, as, least, concern, on, the, iucn, red, list, the, house, sparrow, is, typically, about, 16, cm, 6, 3, in, long, ranging, from, 14, to, 18, cm, 5, 5, to, 7, 1, in, the, house, sparrow, is, a, compact, bird, with, a, full, chest, and, a, large, rounded, head, its, bill, is, stout, and, conical, with, a, culmen, length, of, 1, 1, 1, 5, cm, 0, 43, 0, 59, in, strongly, built, as, an, adaptation, for, eating, seeds, its, tail, is, short, at, 5, 2, 6, 5, cm, 2, 0, 2, 6, in, long, the, wing, chord, is, 6, 7, 8, 9, cm, 2, 6, 3, 5, in, and, the, tarsus, is, 1, 6, 2, 5, cm, 0, 63, 0, 98, in, wingspan, ranges, from, 19, 25, centimetres, 7, 5, 9, 8, in, in, mass, the, house, sparrow, ranges, from, 24, to, 39, 5, g, 0, 85, to, 1, 39, oz, females, usually, are, slightly, smaller, than, males, the, median, mass, on, the, european, continent, for, both, sexes, is, about, 30, g, 1, 1, oz, and, in, more, southerly, subspecies, is, around, 26, g, 0, 92, oz, younger, birds, are, smaller, males, are, larger, during, the, winter, and, females, are, larger, during, the, breeding, season, birds, at, higher, latitudes, colder, climates, and, sometimes, higher, altitudes, are, larger, under, bergmann, s, rule, both, between, and, within, subspecies, the, plumage, of, the, house, sparrow, is, mostly, different, shades, of, grey, and, brown, the, sexes, exhibit, strong, dimorphism, the, female, is, mostly, buffish, above, and, below, while, the, male, has, boldly, coloured, head, markings, a, reddish, back, and, grey, underparts, the, male, has, a, dark, grey, crown, from, the, top, of, its, bill, to, its, back, and, chestnut, brown, flanking, its, crown, on, the, sides, of, its, head, it, has, black, around, its, bill, on, its, throat, and, on, the, spaces, between, its, bill, and, eyes, lores, it, has, a, small, white, stripe, between, the, lores, and, crown, and, small, white, spots, immediately, behind, the, eyes, postoculars, with, black, patches, below, and, above, them, the, underparts, are, pale, grey, or, white, as, are, the, cheeks, ear, coverts, and, stripes, at, the, base, of, the, head, the, upper, back, and, mantle, are, a, warm, brown, with, broad, black, streaks, while, the, lower, back, rump, and, upper, tail, coverts, are, greyish, brown, the, male, is, duller, in, fresh, nonbreeding, plumage, with, whitish, tips, on, many, feathers, wear, and, preening, expose, many, of, the, bright, brown, and, black, markings, including, most, of, the, black, throat, and, chest, patch, called, the, bib, or, badge, the, badge, is, variable, in, width, and, general, size, and, may, signal, social, status, or, fitness, this, hypothesis, has, led, to, a, veritable, cottage, industry, of, studies, which, have, only, conclusively, shown, that, patches, increase, in, size, with, age, the, male, s, bill, is, dark, grey, but, black, in, the, breeding, season, the, female, has, no, black, markings, or, grey, crown, its, upperparts, and, head, are, brown, with, darker, streaks, around, the, mantle, and, a, distinct, pale, supercilium, its, underparts, are, pale, grey, brown, the, female, s, bill, is, brownish, grey, and, becomes, darker, in, breeding, plumage, approaching, the, black, of, the, male, s, bill, juveniles, are, similar, to, the, adult, female, but, deeper, brown, below, and, paler, above, with, paler, and, less, defined, supercilia, juveniles, have, broader, buff, feather, edges, and, tend, to, have, looser, scruffier, plumage, like, moulting, adults, juvenile, males, tend, to, have, darker, throats, and, white, postoculars, like, adult, males, while, juvenile, females, tend, to, have, white, throats, however, juveniles, cannot, be, reliably, sexed, by, plumage, some, juvenile, males, lack, any, markings, of, the, adult, male, and, some, juvenile, females, have, male, features, the, bills, of, young, birds, are, light, yellow, to, straw, paler, than, the, female, s, bill, immature, males, have, paler, versions, of, the, adult, male, s, markings, which, can, be, very, indistinct, in, fresh, plumage, by, their, first, breeding, season, young, birds, generally, are, indistinguishable, from, other, adults, though, they, may, still, be, paler, during, their, first, year, most, house, sparrow, vocalisations, are, variations, on, its, short, and, frequent, chirping, call, transcribed, as, chirrup, tschilp, or, philip, this, note, is, made, as, a, contact, call, by, flocking, or, resting, birds, or, by, males, to, proclaim, nest, ownership, and, invite, pairing, in, the, breeding, season, the, male, gives, this, call, repetitively, with, emphasis, and, speed, but, not, much, rhythm, forming, what, is, described, either, as, a, song, or, an, ecstatic, call, similar, to, a, song, young, birds, also, give, a, true, song, especially, in, captivity, a, warbling, similar, to, that, of, the, european, greenfinch, aggressive, males, give, a, trilled, version, of, their, call, transcribed, as, chur, chur, r, r, it, it, it, it, this, call, is, also, used, by, females, in, the, breeding, season, to, establish, dominance, over, males, while, displacing, them, to, feed, young, or, incubate, eggs, house, sparrows, give, a, nasal, alarm, call, the, basic, sound, of, which, is, transcribed, as, quer, and, a, shrill, chree, call, in, great, distress, another, vocalisation, is, the, appeasement, call, a, soft, quee, given, to, inhibit, aggression, usually, given, between, birds, of, a, mated, pair, these, vocalisations, are, not, unique, to, the, house, sparrow, but, are, shared, with, small, variations, by, all, sparrows, some, variation, is, seen, in, the, 12, subspecies, of, house, sparrows, which, are, divided, into, two, groups, the, oriental, p, d, indicus, group, and, the, palaearctic, p, d, domesticus, group, birds, of, the, p, d, domesticus, group, have, grey, cheeks, while, p, d, indicus, group, birds, have, white, cheeks, as, well, as, bright, colouration, on, the, crown, a, smaller, bill, and, a, longer, black, bib, the, subspecies, p, d, tingitanus, differs, little, from, the, nominate, subspecies, except, in, the, worn, breeding, plumage, of, the, male, in, which, the, head, is, speckled, with, black, and, underparts, are, paler, p, d, balearoibericus, is, slightly, paler, than, the, nominate, but, darker, than, p, d, bibilicus, p, d, bibilicus, is, paler, than, most, subspecies, but, has, the, grey, cheeks, of, p, d, domesticus, group, birds, the, similar, p, d, persicus, is, paler, and, smaller, and, p, d, niloticus, is, nearly, identical, but, smaller, of, the, less, widespread, p, d, indicus, group, subspecies, p, d, hyrcanus, is, larger, than, p, d, indicus, p, d, hufufae, is, paler, p, d, bactrianus, is, larger, and, paler, and, p, d, parkini, is, larger, and, darker, with, more, black, on, the, breast, than, any, other, subspecies, the, house, sparrow, can, be, confused, with, a, number, of, other, seed, eating, birds, especially, its, relatives, in, the, genus, passer, many, of, these, relatives, are, smaller, with, an, appearance, that, is, neater, or, cuter, as, with, the, dead, sea, sparrow, the, light, brown, coloured, female, can, often, not, be, distinguished, from, other, females, and, is, nearly, identical, to, those, of, the, spanish, and, italian, sparrows, the, eurasian, tree, sparrow, is, smaller, and, slenderer, with, a, chestnut, crown, and, a, black, patch, on, each, cheek, the, male, spanish, sparrow, and, italian, sparrow, are, distinguished, by, their, chestnut, crowns, the, sind, sparrow, is, very, similar, but, smaller, with, less, black, on, the, male, s, throat, and, a, distinct, pale, supercilium, on, the, female, the, house, sparrow, was, among, the, first, animals, to, be, given, a, scientific, name, in, the, modern, system, of, biological, classification, since, it, was, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, the, 1758, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, it, was, described, from, a, type, specimen, collected, in, sweden, with, the, name, fringilla, domestica, later, the, genus, name, fringilla, came, to, be, used, only, for, the, common, chaffinch, and, its, relatives, and, the, house, sparrow, has, usually, been, placed, in, the, genus, passer, created, by, french, zoologist, mathurin, jacques, brisson, in, 1760, the, bird, s, scientific, name, and, its, usual, english, name, have, the, same, meaning, the, latin, word, passer, like, the, english, word, sparrow, is, a, term, for, small, active, birds, coming, from, a, root, word, referring, to, speed, the, latin, word, domesticus, means, belonging, to, the, house, like, the, common, name, a, reference, to, its, association, with, humans, the, house, sparrow, is, also, called, by, a, number, of, alternative, english, names, including, english, sparrow, chiefly, in, north, america, and, indian, sparrow, or, indian, house, sparrow, for, the, birds, of, the, indian, subcontinent, and, central, asia, dialectal, names, include, sparr, sparrer, spadger, spadgick, and, philip, mainly, in, southern, england, spug, and, spuggy, mainly, in, northern, england, spur, and, sprig, mainly, in, scotland, and, spatzie, or, spotsie, from, the, german, spatz, in, north, america, the, genus, passer, contains, about, 25, species, depending, on, the, authority, 26, according, to, the, handbook, of, the, birds, of, the, world, most, passer, species, are, dull, coloured, birds, with, short, square, tails, and, stubby, conical, beaks, between, 11, and, 18, cm, 4, 3, and, 7, 1, in, long, mitochondrial, dna, studies, suggest, that, speciation, in, the, genus, occurred, during, the, pleistocene, and, earlier, while, other, evidence, suggests, speciation, occurred, 25, 000, to, 15, 000, years, ago, within, passer, the, house, sparrow, is, part, of, the, palaearctic, black, bibbed, sparrows, group, and, a, close, relative, of, the, mediterranean, willow, sparrows, the, taxonomy, of, the, house, sparrow, and, its, mediterranean, relatives, is, complicated, the, common, type, of, willow, sparrow, is, the, spanish, sparrow, which, resembles, the, house, sparrow, in, many, respects, it, frequently, prefers, wetter, habitats, than, the, house, sparrow, and, it, is, often, colonial, and, nomadic, in, most, of, the, mediterranean, one, or, both, species, occur, with, some, degree, of, hybridisation, in, north, africa, the, two, species, hybridise, extensively, forming, highly, variable, mixed, populations, with, a, full, range, of, characters, from, pure, house, sparrows, to, pure, spanish, sparrows, in, most, of, italy, the, breeding, species, is, the, italian, sparrow, which, has, an, appearance, intermediate, between, those, of, the, house, and, spanish, sparrows, its, specific, status, and, origin, are, the, subject, of, much, debate, but, it, may, be, a, case, of, long, ago, hybrid, speciation, in, the, alps, the, italian, sparrow, intergrades, over, a, narrow, roughly, 20, km, 12, mi, strip, with, the, house, sparrow, and, some, house, sparrows, migrate, into, the, italian, sparrow, s, range, in, winter, on, the, mediterranean, islands, of, malta, gozo, crete, rhodes, and, karpathos, other, apparently, intermediate, birds, are, of, unknown, status, a, large, number, of, subspecies, have, been, named, of, which, 12, were, recognised, in, the, handbook, of, the, birds, of, the, world, these, subspecies, are, divided, into, two, groups, the, palaearctic, p, d, domesticus, group, and, the, oriental, p, d, indicus, group, several, middle, eastern, subspecies, including, p, d, biblicus, are, sometimes, considered, a, third, intermediate, group, the, subspecies, p, d, indicus, was, described, as, a, species, and, was, considered, to, be, distinct, by, many, ornithologists, during, the, 19th, century, migratory, birds, of, the, subspecies, p, d, bactrianus, in, the, p, d, indicus, group, were, recorded, overlapping, with, p, d, domesticus, birds, without, hybridising, in, the, 1970s, so, the, soviet, scientists, edward, i, gavrilov, and, m, n, korelov, proposed, the, separation, of, the, p, d, indicus, group, as, a, separate, species, however, p, d, indicus, group, and, p, d, domesticus, group, birds, intergrade, in, a, large, part, of, iran, so, this, split, is, rarely, recognised, in, north, america, house, sparrow, populations, are, more, differentiated, than, those, in, europe, this, variation, follows, predictable, patterns, with, birds, at, higher, latitudes, being, larger, and, darker, and, those, in, arid, areas, being, smaller, and, paler, however, how, much, this, is, caused, by, evolution, or, by, environment, is, not, clear, similar, observations, have, been, made, in, new, zealand, and, in, south, africa, the, introduced, house, sparrow, populations, may, be, distinct, enough, to, merit, subspecies, status, especially, in, north, america, and, southern, africa, and, american, ornithologist, harry, church, oberholser, even, gave, the, subspecies, name, p, d, plecticus, to, the, paler, birds, of, western, north, america, the, house, sparrow, originated, in, the, middle, east, and, spread, along, with, agriculture, to, most, of, eurasia, and, parts, of, north, africa, since, the, mid, 19th, century, it, has, reached, most, of, the, world, chiefly, due, to, deliberate, introductions, but, also, through, natural, and, shipborne, dispersal, its, introduced, range, encompasses, most, of, north, america, including, bermuda, central, america, southern, south, america, southern, africa, part, of, west, africa, australia, new, zealand, and, islands, throughout, the, world, it, has, greatly, extended, its, range, in, northern, eurasia, since, the, 1850s, and, continues, to, do, so, as, was, shown, by, its, colonisation, around, 1990, of, iceland, and, rishiri, island, japan, the, extent, of, its, range, makes, it, the, most, widely, distributed, wild, bird, on, the, planet, the, house, sparrow, has, become, highly, successful, in, most, parts, of, the, world, where, it, has, been, introduced, this, is, mostly, due, to, its, early, adaptation, to, living, with, humans, and, its, adaptability, to, a, wide, range, of, conditions, other, factors, may, include, its, robust, immune, response, compared, to, the, eurasian, tree, sparrow, where, introduced, it, can, extend, its, range, quickly, sometimes, at, a, rate, over, 230, km, 140, mi, per, year, in, many, parts, of, the, world, it, has, been, characterised, as, a, pest, and, poses, a, threat, to, native, birds, a, few, introductions, have, died, out, or, been, of, limited, success, such, as, those, to, greenland, and, cape, verde, the, first, of, many, successful, introductions, to, north, america, occurred, when, birds, from, england, were, released, in, new, york, city, in, 1852, intended, to, control, the, ravages, of, the, linden, moth, in, north, america, the, house, sparrow, now, occurs, from, the, northwest, territories, of, canada, to, southern, panama, and, it, is, one, of, the, most, abundant, birds, of, the, continent, the, house, sparrow, was, first, introduced, to, australia, in, 1863, at, melbourne, and, is, common, throughout, the, eastern, part, of, the, continent, as, far, north, as, cape, york, but, has, been, prevented, from, establishing, itself, in, western, australia, where, every, house, sparrow, found, in, the, state, is, killed, house, sparrows, were, introduced, in, new, zealand, in, 1859, and, from, there, reached, many, of, the, pacific, islands, including, hawaii, in, southern, africa, birds, of, both, the, european, subspecies, p, d, domesticus, and, the, indian, subspecies, p, d, indicus, were, introduced, around, 1900, birds, of, p, d, domesticus, ancestry, are, confined, to, a, few, towns, while, p, d, indicus, birds, have, spread, rapidly, reaching, tanzania, in, the, 1980s, despite, this, rapid, spread, native, relatives, such, as, the, cape, sparrow, also, occur, and, thrive, in, urban, habitats, in, south, america, it, was, first, introduced, near, buenos, aires, around, 1870, and, quickly, became, common, in, most, of, the, southern, part, of, the, continent, it, now, occurs, almost, continuously, from, tierra, del, fuego, to, the, fringes, of, the, amazon, basin, with, isolated, populations, as, far, north, as, coastal, venezuela, the, house, sparrow, is, closely, associated, with, human, habitation, and, cultivation, it, is, not, an, obligate, commensal, of, humans, as, some, have, suggested, birds, of, the, migratory, central, asian, subspecies, usually, breed, away, from, humans, in, open, country, and, birds, elsewhere, are, occasionally, found, away, from, humans, the, only, terrestrial, habitats, that, the, house, sparrow, does, not, inhabit, are, dense, forest, and, tundra, well, adapted, to, living, around, humans, it, frequently, lives, and, even, breeds, indoors, especially, in, factories, warehouses, and, zoos, it, has, been, recorded, breeding, in, an, english, coal, mine, 640, m, 2, 100, ft, below, ground, and, feeding, on, the, empire, state, building, s, observation, deck, at, night, it, reaches, its, greatest, densities, in, urban, centres, but, its, reproductive, success, is, greater, in, suburbs, where, insects, are, more, abundant, on, a, larger, scale, it, is, most, abundant, in, wheat, growing, areas, such, as, the, midwestern, united, states, it, tolerates, a, variety, of, climates, but, prefers, drier, conditions, especially, in, moist, tropical, climates, it, has, several, adaptations, to, dry, areas, including, a, high, salt, tolerance, and, an, ability, to, survive, without, water, by, ingesting, berries, in, most, of, eastern, asia, the, house, sparrow, is, entirely, absent, replaced, by, the, eurasian, tree, sparrow, where, these, two, species, overlap, the, house, sparrow, is, usually, more, common, than, the, eurasian, tree, sparrow, but, one, species, may, replace, the, other, in, a, manner, that, ornithologist, maud, doria, haviland, described, as, random, or, even, capricious, in, most, of, its, range, the, house, sparrow, is, extremely, common, despite, some, declines, but, in, marginal, habitats, such, as, rainforest, or, mountain, ranges, its, distribution, can, be, spotty, the, house, sparrow, is, a, very, social, bird, it, is, gregarious, during, all, seasons, when, feeding, often, forming, flocks, with, other, species, of, birds, it, roosts, communally, while, breeding, nests, are, usually, grouped, together, in, clumps, house, sparrows, also, engage, in, social, activities, such, as, dust, or, water, bathing, and, social, singing, in, which, birds, call, together, in, bushes, the, house, sparrow, feeds, mostly, on, the, ground, but, it, flocks, in, trees, and, bushes, at, feeding, stations, and, nests, female, house, sparrows, are, dominant, despite, their, smaller, size, and, they, can, fight, over, males, in, the, breeding, season, house, sparrows, sleep, with, the, bill, tucked, underneath, the, scapular, feathers, outside, of, the, reproductive, season, they, often, roost, communally, in, trees, or, shrubs, much, communal, chirping, occurs, before, and, after, the, birds, settle, in, the, roost, in, the, evening, as, well, as, before, the, birds, leave, the, roost, in, the, morning, some, congregating, sites, separate, from, the, roost, may, be, visited, by, the, birds, prior, to, settling, in, for, the, night, dust, or, water, bathing, is, common, and, often, occurs, in, groups, anting, is, rare, head, scratching, is, done, with, the, leg, over, the, drooped, wing, as, an, adult, the, house, sparrow, mostly, feeds, on, the, seeds, of, grains, and, weeds, but, it, is, opportunistic, and, adaptable, and, eats, whatever, foods, are, available, in, towns, and, cities, it, often, scavenges, for, food, in, garbage, containers, and, congregates, in, the, outdoors, of, restaurants, and, other, eating, establishments, to, feed, on, leftover, food, and, crumbs, it, can, perform, complex, tasks, to, obtain, food, such, as, opening, automatic, doors, to, enter, supermarkets, clinging, to, hotel, walls, to, watch, vacationers, on, their, balconies, and, nectar, robbing, kowhai, flowers, in, common, with, many, other, birds, the, house, sparrow, requires, grit, to, digest, the, harder, items, in, its, diet, grit, can, be, either, stone, often, grains, of, masonry, or, the, shells, of, eggs, or, snails, oblong, and, rough, grains, are, preferred, several, studies, of, the, house, sparrow, in, temperate, agricultural, areas, have, found, the, proportion, of, seeds, in, its, diet, to, be, about, 90, it, will, eat, almost, any, seeds, but, where, it, has, a, choice, it, prefers, corn, oats, wheat, or, maize, rural, birds, tend, to, eat, more, waste, seed, from, animal, dung, and, seed, from, fields, while, urban, birds, tend, to, eat, more, commercial, bird, seed, and, weed, seed, in, urban, areas, the, house, sparrow, also, feeds, largely, on, food, provided, directly, or, indirectly, by, humans, such, as, bread, though, it, prefers, raw, seeds, the, house, sparrow, also, eats, some, plant, matter, besides, seeds, including, buds, berries, and, fruits, such, as, grapes, and, cherries, in, temperate, areas, the, house, sparrow, has, an, unusual, habit, of, tearing, flowers, especially, yellow, ones, in, the, spring, animals, form, another, important, part, of, the, house, sparrow, s, diet, chiefly, insects, of, which, beetles, caterpillars, dipteran, flies, and, aphids, are, especially, important, various, noninsect, arthropods, are, eaten, as, are, molluscs, and, crustaceans, where, available, earthworms, and, even, vertebrates, such, as, lizards, and, frogs, young, house, sparrows, are, fed, mostly, on, insects, until, about, 15, days, after, hatching, they, are, also, given, small, quantities, of, seeds, spiders, and, grit, in, most, places, grasshoppers, and, crickets, are, the, most, abundant, foods, of, nestlings, true, bugs, ants, sawflies, and, beetles, are, also, important, but, house, sparrows, take, advantage, of, whatever, foods, are, abundant, to, feed, their, young, house, sparrows, have, been, observed, stealing, prey, from, other, birds, including, american, robins, the, gut, microbiota, of, house, sparrows, differs, between, chicks, and, adults, with, pseudomonadota, formerly, proteobacteria, decreasing, in, chicks, when, they, get, to, around, 9, days, old, whilst, the, relative, abundance, of, bacillota, increase, the, house, sparrow, s, flight, is, direct, not, undulating, and, flapping, averaging, 45, 5, km, h, 28, 3, mph, and, about, 15, wingbeats, per, second, on, the, ground, the, house, sparrow, typically, hops, rather, than, walks, it, can, swim, when, pressed, to, do, so, by, pursuit, from, predators, captive, birds, have, been, recorded, diving, and, swimming, short, distances, under, water, most, house, sparrows, do, not, move, more, than, a, few, kilometres, during, their, lifetimes, however, limited, migration, occurs, in, all, regions, some, young, birds, disperse, long, distances, especially, on, coasts, and, mountain, birds, move, to, lower, elevations, in, winter, two, subspecies, p, d, bactrianus, and, p, d, parkini, are, predominantly, migratory, unlike, the, birds, in, sedentary, populations, that, migrate, birds, of, migratory, subspecies, prepare, for, migration, by, putting, on, weight, house, sparrows, can, breed, in, the, breeding, season, immediately, following, their, hatching, and, sometimes, attempt, to, do, so, some, birds, breeding, for, the, first, time, in, tropical, areas, are, only, a, few, months, old, and, still, have, juvenile, plumage, birds, breeding, for, the, first, time, are, rarely, successful, in, raising, young, and, reproductive, success, increases, with, age, as, older, birds, breed, earlier, in, the, breeding, season, and, fledge, more, young, as, the, breeding, season, approaches, hormone, releases, trigger, enormous, increases, in, the, size, of, the, sexual, organs, and, changes, in, day, length, lead, males, to, start, calling, by, nesting, sites, the, timing, of, mating, and, egg, laying, varies, geographically, and, between, specific, locations, and, years, because, a, sufficient, supply, of, insects, is, needed, for, egg, formation, and, feeding, nestlings, males, take, up, nesting, sites, before, the, breeding, season, by, frequently, calling, beside, them, unmated, males, start, nest, construction, and, call, particularly, frequently, to, attract, females, when, a, female, approaches, a, male, during, this, period, the, male, displays, by, moving, up, and, down, while, drooping, and, shivering, his, wings, pushing, up, his, head, raising, and, spreading, his, tail, and, showing, his, bib, males, may, try, to, mate, with, females, while, calling, or, displaying, in, response, a, female, will, adopt, a, threatening, posture, and, attack, a, male, before, flying, away, pursued, by, the, male, the, male, displays, in, front, of, her, attracting, other, males, which, also, pursue, and, display, to, the, female, this, group, display, usually, does, not, immediately, result, in, copulations, other, males, usually, do, not, copulate, with, the, female, copulation, is, typically, initiated, by, the, female, giving, a, soft, dee, dee, dee, call, to, the, male, birds, of, a, pair, copulate, frequently, until, the, female, is, laying, eggs, and, the, male, mounts, the, female, repeatedly, each, time, a, pair, mates, the, house, sparrow, is, monogamous, and, typically, mates, for, life, but, birds, from, pairs, often, engage, in, extra, pair, copulations, so, about, 15, of, house, sparrow, fledglings, are, unrelated, to, their, mother, s, mate, males, guard, their, mates, carefully, to, avoid, being, cuckolded, and, most, extra, pair, copulation, occurs, away, from, nest, sites, males, may, sometimes, have, multiple, mates, and, bigamy, is, mostly, limited, by, aggression, between, females, many, birds, do, not, find, a, nest, and, a, mate, and, instead, may, serve, as, helpers, around, the, nest, for, mated, pairs, a, role, which, increases, the, chances, of, being, chosen, to, replace, a, lost, mate, lost, mates, of, both, sexes, can, be, replaced, quickly, during, the, breeding, season, the, formation, of, a, pair, and, the, bond, between, the, two, birds, is, tied, to, the, holding, of, a, nest, site, though, paired, house, sparrows, can, recognise, each, other, away, from, the, nest, house, sparrows, in, natural, small, populations, as, can, occur, on, islands, exhibit, inbreeding, depression, inbreeding, depression, is, manifested, as, lower, survival, probability, and, production, of, fewer, offspring, and, can, occur, as, a, result, of, the, expression, of, deleterious, recessive, alleles, however, sparrows, in, such, populations, do, not, appear, to, avoid, inbreeding, nest, sites, are, varied, though, cavities, are, preferred, nests, are, most, frequently, built, in, the, eaves, and, other, crevices, of, houses, holes, in, cliffs, and, banks, and, tree, hollows, are, also, used, a, sparrow, sometimes, excavates, its, own, nests, in, sandy, banks, or, rotten, branches, but, more, frequently, uses, the, nests, of, other, birds, such, as, those, of, swallows, in, banks, and, cliffs, and, old, tree, cavity, nests, it, usually, uses, deserted, nests, though, sometimes, it, usurps, active, ones, by, driving, away, or, killing, the, occupants, tree, hollows, are, more, commonly, used, in, north, america, than, in, europe, putting, the, sparrows, in, competition, with, bluebirds, and, other, north, american, cavity, nesters, and, thereby, contributing, to, their, population, declines, especially, in, warmer, areas, the, house, sparrow, may, build, its, nests, in, the, open, on, the, branches, of, trees, especially, evergreens, and, hawthorns, or, in, the, nests, of, large, birds, such, as, storks, or, magpies, in, open, nesting, sites, breeding, success, tends, to, be, lower, since, breeding, begins, late, and, the, nest, can, easily, be, destroyed, or, damaged, by, storms, less, common, nesting, sites, include, street, lights, and, neon, signs, favoured, for, their, warmth, and, the, old, open, topped, nests, of, other, songbirds, which, are, then, domed, over, usually, the, couples, repeat, copulation, many, times, every, copulation, is, followed, by, some, break, of, 3, to, 4, seconds, and, in, that, time, both, pair, change, their, position, by, some, distance, the, nest, is, usually, domed, though, it, may, lack, a, roof, in, enclosed, sites, it, has, an, outer, layer, of, stems, and, roots, a, middle, layer, of, dead, grass, and, leaves, and, a, lining, of, feathers, as, well, as, of, paper, and, other, soft, materials, nests, typically, have, external, dimensions, of, 20, 30, cm, 8, 12, in, but, their, size, varies, greatly, the, building, of, the, nest, is, initiated, by, the, unmated, male, while, displaying, to, females, the, female, assists, in, building, but, is, less, active, than, the, male, some, nest, building, occurs, throughout, the, year, especially, after, moult, in, autumn, in, colder, areas, house, sparrows, build, specially, created, roost, nests, or, roost, in, street, lights, to, avoid, losing, heat, during, the, winter, house, sparrows, do, not, hold, territories, but, they, defend, their, nests, aggressively, against, intruders, of, the, same, sex, house, sparrows, nests, support, a, wide, range, of, scavenging, insects, including, nest, flies, such, as, neottiophilum, praestum, protocalliphora, blowflies, and, over, 1, 400, species, of, beetle, clutches, usually, comprise, four, or, five, eggs, though, numbers, from, one, to, 10, have, been, recorded, at, least, two, clutches, are, usually, laid, and, up, to, seven, a, year, may, be, laid, in, the, tropics, or, four, a, year, in, temperate, latitudes, when, fewer, clutches, are, laid, in, a, year, especially, at, higher, latitudes, the, number, of, eggs, per, clutch, is, greater, central, asian, house, sparrows, which, migrate, and, have, only, one, clutch, a, year, average, 6, 5, eggs, in, a, clutch, clutch, size, is, also, affected, by, environmental, and, seasonal, conditions, female, age, and, breeding, density, some, intraspecific, brood, parasitism, occurs, and, instances, of, unusually, large, numbers, of, eggs, in, a, nest, may, be, the, result, of, females, laying, eggs, in, the, nests, of, their, neighbours, such, foreign, eggs, are, sometimes, recognised, and, ejected, by, females, the, house, sparrow, is, a, victim, of, interspecific, brood, parasites, but, only, rarely, since, it, usually, uses, nests, in, holes, too, small, for, parasites, to, enter, and, it, feeds, its, young, foods, unsuitable, for, young, parasites, in, turn, the, house, sparrow, has, once, been, recorded, as, a, brood, parasite, of, the, american, cliff, swallow, the, eggs, are, white, bluish, white, or, greenish, white, spotted, with, brown, or, grey, subelliptical, in, shape, they, range, from, 20, to, 22, mm, 0, 79, to, 0, 87, in, in, length, and,

develops, a, brood, patch, of, bare, skin, and, plays, the, main, part, in, incubating, the, eggs, the, male, helps, but, can, only, cover, the, eggs, rather, than, truly, incubate, them, the, female, spends, the, night, incubating, during, this, period, while, the, male, roosts, near, the, nest, eggs, hatch, at, the, same, time, after, a, short, incubation, period, lasting, 11, 14, days, and, exceptionally, for, as, many, as, 17, or, as, few, as, 9, the, length, of, the, incubation, period, decreases, as, ambient, temperature, increases, later, in, the, breeding, season, young, house, sparrows, remain, in, the, nest, for, 11, to, 23, days, normally, 14, to, 16, days, during, this, time, they, are, fed, by, both, parents, as, newly, hatched, house, sparrows, do, not, have, sufficient, insulation, they, are, brooded, for, a, few, days, or, longer, in, cold, conditions, the, parents, swallow, the, droppings, produced, by, the, hatchlings, during, the, first, few, days, later, the, droppings, are, moved, up, to, 20, m, 66, ft, away, from, the, nest, the, chicks, eyes, open, after, about, 4, days, and, at, an, age, of, about, 8, days, the, young, birds, get, their, first, down, if, both, parents, perish, the, ensuing, intensive, begging, sounds, of, the, young, often, attract, replacement, parents, which, feed, them, until, they, can, sustain, themselves, all, the, young, in, the, nest, leave, it, during, the, same, period, of, a, few, hours, at, this, stage, they, are, normally, able, to, fly, they, start, feeding, themselves, partly, after, 1, or, 2, days, and, sustain, themselves, completely, after, 7, to, 10, days, 14, at, the, latest, house, sparrows, in, natural, small, populations, as, can, occur, on, islands, exhibit, inbreeding, depression, inbreeding, depression, is, manifested, as, lower, survival, probability, and, production, of, fewer, offspring, and, can, occur, as, a, result, of, the, expression, of, deleterious, recessive, alleles, however, sparrows, in, such, populations, do, not, appear, to, avoid, inbreeding, in, adult, house, sparrows, annual, survival, is, 45, 65, after, fledging, and, leaving, the, care, of, their, parents, young, sparrows, have, a, high, mortality, rate, which, lessens, as, they, grow, older, and, more, experienced, only, about, 20, 25, of, birds, hatched, survive, to, their, first, breeding, season, the, oldest, known, wild, house, sparrow, lived, for, nearly, two, decades, it, was, found, dead, 19, years, and, 9, months, after, it, was, ringed, in, denmark, the, oldest, recorded, captive, house, sparrow, lived, for, 23, years, the, typical, ratio, of, males, to, females, in, a, population, is, uncertain, due, to, problems, in, collecting, data, but, a, very, slight, preponderance, of, males, at, all, ages, is, usual, the, house, sparrow, s, main, predators, are, cats, and, birds, of, prey, but, many, other, animals, prey, on, them, including, corvids, squirrels, and, even, humans, the, house, sparrow, has, been, consumed, in, the, past, by, people, in, many, parts, of, the, world, and, it, still, is, in, parts, of, the, mediterranean, most, species, of, birds, of, prey, have, been, recorded, preying, on, the, house, sparrow, in, places, where, records, are, extensive, accipiters, and, the, merlin, in, particular, are, major, predators, though, cats, are, likely, to, have, a, greater, impact, on, house, sparrow, populations, the, house, sparrow, is, also, a, common, victim, of, roadkill, on, european, roads, it, is, the, bird, most, frequently, found, dead, the, house, sparrow, is, host, to, a, huge, number, of, parasites, and, diseases, and, the, effect, of, most, is, unknown, ornithologist, ted, r, anderson, listed, thousands, noting, that, his, list, was, incomplete, the, commonly, recorded, bacterial, pathogens, of, the, house, sparrow, are, often, those, common, in, humans, and, include, salmonella, and, escherichia, coli, salmonella, is, common, in, the, house, sparrow, and, a, comprehensive, study, of, house, sparrow, disease, found, it, in, 13, of, sparrows, tested, salmonella, epidemics, in, the, spring, and, winter, can, kill, large, numbers, of, sparrows, the, house, sparrow, hosts, avian, pox, and, avian, malaria, which, it, has, spread, to, the, native, forest, birds, of, hawaii, many, of, the, diseases, hosted, by, the, house, sparrow, are, also, present, in, humans, and, domestic, animals, for, which, the, house, sparrow, acts, as, a, reservoir, host, arboviruses, such, as, the, west, nile, virus, which, most, commonly, infect, insects, and, mammals, survive, winters, in, temperate, areas, by, going, dormant, in, birds, such, as, the, house, sparrow, a, few, records, indicate, disease, extirpating, house, sparrow, populations, especially, from, scottish, islands, but, this, seems, to, be, rare, house, sparrows, are, also, infected, by, haemosporidian, parasites, but, less, so, in, urban, than, in, rural, areas, toxoplasma, gondii, has, been, detected, in, sparrows, in, northwestern, china, where, they, pose, a, risk, due, to, their, meat, being, consumed, in, the, region, the, house, sparrow, is, infested, by, a, number, of, external, parasites, which, usually, cause, little, harm, to, adult, sparrows, in, europe, the, most, common, mite, found, on, sparrows, is, proctophyllodes, the, most, common, ticks, are, argas, reflexus, and, ixodes, arboricola, and, the, most, common, flea, on, the, house, sparrow, is, ceratophyllus, gallinae, dermanyssus, blood, feeding, mites, are, also, common, ectoparasites, of, house, sparrows, and, these, mites, can, enter, human, habitation, and, bite, humans, causing, a, condition, known, as, gamasoidosis, a, number, of, chewing, lice, occupy, different, niches, on, the, house, sparrow, s, body, menacanthus, lice, occur, across, the, house, sparrow, s, body, where, they, feed, on, blood, and, feathers, while, brueelia, lice, feed, on, feathers, and, philopterus, fringillae, occurs, on, the, head, house, sparrows, express, strong, circadian, rhythms, of, activity, in, the, laboratory, they, were, among, the, first, bird, species, to, be, seriously, studied, in, terms, of, their, circadian, activity, and, photoperiodism, in, part, because, of, their, availability, and, adaptability, in, captivity, but, also, because, they, can, find, their, way, and, remain, rhythmic, in, constant, darkness, the, house, sparrow, is, closely, associated, with, humans, they, are, believed, to, have, become, associated, with, humans, around, 10, 000, years, ago, the, turkestan, subspecies, p, d, bactrianus, is, least, associated, with, humans, and, considered, to, be, evolutionarily, closer, to, the, ancestral, noncommensal, populations, usually, the, house, sparrow, is, regarded, as, a, pest, since, it, consumes, agricultural, products, and, spreads, disease, to, humans, and, their, domestic, animals, even, birdwatchers, often, hold, it, in, little, regard, because, of, its, molestation, of, other, birds, in, most, of, the, world, the, house, sparrow, is, not, protected, by, law, attempts, to, control, house, sparrows, include, the, trapping, poisoning, or, shooting, of, adults, the, destruction, of, their, nests, and, eggs, or, less, directly, blocking, nest, holes, and, scaring, off, sparrows, with, noise, glue, or, porcupine, wire, however, the, house, sparrow, can, be, beneficial, to, humans, as, well, especially, by, eating, insect, pests, and, attempts, at, the, large, scale, control, of, the, house, sparrow, have, failed, the, house, sparrow, has, long, been, used, as, a, food, item, from, around, 1560, to, at, least, the, 19th, century, in, northern, europe, earthenware, sparrow, pots, were, hung, from, eaves, to, attract, nesting, birds, so, the, young, could, be, readily, harvested, wild, birds, were, trapped, in, nets, in, large, numbers, and, sparrow, pie, was, a, traditional, dish, thought, because, of, the, association, of, sparrows, with, lechery, to, have, aphrodisiac, properties, a, traditional, indian, medicine, ci, ukkuruvi, l, kiyam, in, tamil, was, sold, with, similar, aphrodisiac, claims, sparrows, were, also, trapped, as, food, for, falconers, birds, and, zoo, animals, during, the, 1870s, there, were, debates, on, the, damaging, effects, of, sparrows, in, the, house, of, commons, in, england, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, sparrow, clubs, culled, many, millions, of, birds, and, eggs, in, an, attempt, to, control, numbers, of, this, perceived, pest, but, with, only, a, localised, impact, on, numbers, house, sparrows, have, been, kept, as, pets, at, many, times, in, history, though, they, have, no, bright, plumage, or, attractive, songs, and, raising, them, is, difficult, the, house, sparrow, has, an, extremely, large, range, and, population, so, it, is, assessed, as, least, concern, for, conservation, on, the, iucn, red, list, the, iucn, estimates, for, the, global, population, runs, up, to, nearly, 1, 4, billion, individuals, second, among, all, wild, birds, perhaps, only, to, the, red, billed, quelea, in, abundance, although, the, quelea, is, unlike, the, sparrow, restricted, to, a, single, continent, and, has, never, been, subject, to, human, introductions, however, populations, have, been, declining, in, many, parts, of, the, world, especially, near, its, eurasian, places, of, origin, these, declines, were, first, noticed, in, north, america, where, they, were, initially, attributed, to, the, spread, of, the, house, finch, but, have, been, most, severe, in, western, europe, declines, have, not, been, universal, as, no, serious, declines, have, been, reported, from, eastern, europe, but, have, even, occurred, in, australia, where, the, house, sparrow, was, introduced, recently, in, great, britain, populations, peaked, in, the, early, 1970s, but, have, since, declined, by, 68, overall, and, about, 90, in, some, regions, the, rspb, lists, the, house, sparrow, s, uk, conservation, status, as, red, in, london, the, house, sparrow, almost, disappeared, from, the, central, city, the, numbers, of, house, sparrows, in, the, netherlands, have, dropped, in, half, since, the, 1980s, so, the, house, sparrow, is, even, considered, an, endangered, species, this, status, came, to, widespread, attention, after, a, female, house, sparrow, referred, to, as, the, dominomus, was, killed, after, knocking, down, dominoes, arranged, as, part, of, an, attempt, to, set, a, world, record, these, declines, are, not, unprecedented, as, similar, reductions, in, population, occurred, when, the, internal, combustion, engine, replaced, horses, in, the, 1920s, and, a, major, source, of, food, in, the, form, of, grain, spillage, was, lost, declines, have, been, particularly, apparent, even, in, north, america, where, the, house, sparrow, is, invasive, in, some, states, introduced, to, philadelphia, initially, in, 1852, the, house, sparrow, rapidly, spread, across, the, nation, however, the, bird, has, largely, disappeared, from, the, city, nowadays, and, overall, it, is, estimated, to, have, declined, in, north, america, by, 84, since, 1966, in, south, asia, the, house, sparrow, has, largely, vanished, from, major, cities, such, as, karachi, kolkata, mumbai, new, delhi, and, lahore, various, causes, for, the, dramatic, decreases, in, population, have, been, proposed, including, predation, in, particular, by, eurasian, sparrowhawks, electromagnetic, radiation, from, mobile, phones, and, diseases, such, as, avian, malaria, a, shortage, of, nesting, sites, caused, by, changes, in, urban, building, design, is, probably, a, factor, and, conservation, organisations, have, encouraged, the, use, of, special, nest, boxes, for, sparrows, a, primary, cause, of, the, decline, seems, to, be, an, insufficient, supply, of, insect, food, for, nestling, sparrows, declines, in, insect, populations, result, from, an, increase, of, monoculture, crops, the, heavy, use, of, pesticides, the, replacement, of, native, plants, in, cities, with, introduced, plants, and, parking, areas, and, possibly, the, introduction, of, unleaded, petrol, which, produces, toxic, compounds, such, as, methyl, nitrite, protecting, insect, habitats, on, farms, and, planting, native, plants, in, cities, benefit, the, house, sparrow, as, does, establishing, urban, green, spaces, to, raise, awareness, of, threats, to, the, house, sparrow, world, sparrow, day, has, been, celebrated, on, 20, march, across, the, world, since, 2010, over, the, recent, years, the, house, sparrow, population, has, been, on, the, decline, in, many, asian, countries, and, this, decline, is, quite, evident, in, india, to, promote, the, conservation, of, these, birds, in, 2012, the, house, sparrow, was, declared, as, the, state, bird, of, delhi, to, many, people, across, the, world, the, house, sparrow, is, the, most, familiar, wild, animal, and, because, of, its, association, with, humans, and, familiarity, it, is, frequently, used, to, represent, the, common, and, vulgar, or, the, lewd, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, introduction, of, house, sparrows, throughout, the, world, was, their, association, with, the, european, homeland, of, many, immigrants, birds, usually, described, later, as, sparrows, are, referred, to, in, many, works, of, ancient, literature, and, religious, texts, in, europe, and, western, asia, these, references, may, not, always, refer, specifically, to, the, house, sparrow, or, even, to, small, seed, eating, birds, but, later, writers, who, were, inspired, by, these, texts, often, had, the, house, sparrow, in, mind, in, particular, sparrows, were, associated, by, the, ancient, greeks, with, aphrodite, the, goddess, of, love, due, to, their, perceived, lustfulness, an, association, echoed, by, later, writers, such, as, chaucer, and, shakespeare, jesus, s, use, of, sparrows, as, an, example, of, divine, providence, in, the, gospel, of, matthew, also, inspired, later, references, such, as, that, in, shakespeare, s, hamlet, and, the, gospel, hymn, his, eye, is, on, the, sparrow
