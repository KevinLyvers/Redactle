hyenas, or, hyaenas, h, a, i, n, z, hi, ee, n, z, from, ancient, greek, h, aina, are, feliform, carnivoran, mammals, belonging, to, the, family, hyaenidae, h, a, n, d, i, with, just, four, extant, species, each, in, its, own, genus, it, is, the, fifth, smallest, family, in, the, order, carnivora, and, one, of, the, smallest, in, the, class, mammalia, despite, their, low, diversity, hyenas, are, unique, and, vital, components, of, most, african, ecosystems, although, phylogenetically, closer, to, felines, and, viverrids, hyenas, are, behaviourally, and, morphologically, similar, to, canids, in, several, elements, due, to, convergent, evolution, both, hyenas, and, canines, are, non, arboreal, cursorial, hunters, that, catch, prey, with, their, teeth, rather, than, claws, both, eat, food, quickly, and, may, store, it, and, their, calloused, feet, with, large, blunt, nonretractable, claws, are, adapted, for, running, and, making, sharp, turns, however, hyenas, grooming, scent, marking, defecation, habits, mating, and, parental, behavior, are, consistent, with, the, behavior, of, other, feliforms, hyenas, feature, prominently, in, the, folklore, and, mythology, of, human, cultures, that, live, alongside, them, hyenas, are, commonly, viewed, as, frightening, and, worthy, of, contempt, in, some, cultures, hyenas, are, thought, to, influence, people, s, spirits, rob, graves, and, steal, livestock, and, children, other, cultures, associate, them, with, witchcraft, using, their, body, parts, in, traditional, medicine, hyenas, originated, in, the, jungles, of, miocene, eurasia, 22, million, years, ago, when, most, early, feliform, species, were, still, largely, arboreal, the, first, ancestral, hyenas, were, likely, similar, to, the, modern, african, civet, one, of, the, earliest, hyena, species, described, plioviverrops, was, a, lithe, civet, like, animal, that, inhabited, eurasia, 20, 22, million, years, ago, and, is, identifiable, as, a, hyaenid, by, the, structure, of, the, middle, ear, and, dentition, the, lineage, of, plioviverrops, prospered, and, gave, rise, to, descendants, with, longer, legs, and, more, pointed, jaws, a, direction, similar, to, that, taken, by, canids, in, north, america, hyenas, then, diversified, into, two, distinct, types, lightly, built, dog, like, hyenas, and, robust, bone, crushing, hyenas, although, the, dog, like, hyenas, thrived, 15, million, years, ago, with, one, taxon, having, colonised, north, america, they, became, extinct, after, a, change, in, climate, along, with, the, arrival, of, canids, into, eurasia, of, the, dog, like, hyena, lineage, only, the, insectivorous, aardwolf, survived, while, the, bone, crushing, hyenas, including, the, extant, spotted, brown, and, striped, hyenas, became, the, undisputed, top, scavengers, of, eurasia, and, africa, the, descendants, of, plioviverrops, reached, their, peak, 15, million, years, ago, with, more, than, 30, species, having, been, identified, unlike, most, modern, hyena, species, which, are, specialised, bone, crushers, these, dog, like, hyenas, were, nimble, bodied, wolfish, animals, one, species, among, them, was, ictitherium, viverrinum, which, was, similar, to, a, jackal, the, dog, like, hyenas, were, numerous, in, some, miocene, fossil, sites, the, remains, of, ictitherium, and, other, dog, like, hyenas, outnumber, those, of, all, other, carnivores, combined, the, decline, of, the, dog, like, hyenas, began, 5, 7, million, years, ago, during, a, period, of, climate, change, exacerbated, by, canids, crossing, the, bering, land, bridge, to, eurasia, one, species, chasmaporthetes, ossifragus, managed, to, cross, the, land, bridge, into, north, america, being, the, only, hyena, to, do, so, chasmaporthetes, managed, to, survive, for, some, time, in, north, america, by, deviating, from, the, endurance, running, and, bone, crushing, niches, monopolized, by, canids, and, developing, into, a, cheetah, like, sprinter, most, of, the, dog, like, hyenas, had, died, off, by, 1, 5, million, years, ago, by, 10, 14, million, years, ago, the, hyena, family, had, split, into, two, distinct, groups, dog, like, hyenas, and, bone, crushing, hyenas, the, arrival, of, the, ancestral, bone, crushing, hyenas, coincided, with, the, decline, of, the, similarly, built, family, percrocutidae, the, bone, crushing, hyenas, survived, the, changes, in, climate, and, the, arrival, of, canids, which, wiped, out, the, dog, like, hyenas, though, they, never, crossed, into, north, america, as, their, niche, there, had, already, been, taken, by, the, dog, subfamily, borophaginae, by, 5, million, years, ago, the, bone, crushing, hyenas, had, become, the, dominant, scavengers, of, eurasia, primarily, feeding, on, large, herbivore, carcasses, felled, by, sabre, toothed, cats, one, genus, pachycrocuta, was, a, 200, kg, 440, lb, mega, scavenger, that, could, splinter, the, bones, of, elephants, starting, in, the, early, middle, pleistocene, pachycrocuta, was, replaced, by, the, smaller, crocuta, and, hyena, which, corresponds, to, a, general, faunal, change, perhaps, in, connection, to, the, mid, pleistocene, transition, the, four, extant, species, are, the, striped, hyena, hyaena, hyaena, the, brown, hyena, parahyaena, brunnea, the, spotted, hyena, crocuta, crocuta, and, the, aardwolf, proteles, cristata, the, aardwolf, can, trace, its, lineage, directly, back, to, plioviverrops, 15, million, years, ago, and, is, the, only, survivor, of, the, dog, like, hyena, lineage, its, success, is, partly, attributed, to, its, insectivorous, diet, for, which, it, faced, no, competition, from, canids, crossing, from, north, america, it, is, likely, that, its, unrivaled, ability, to, digest, the, terpene, excretions, from, soldier, termites, is, a, modification, of, the, strong, digestive, system, its, ancestors, used, to, consume, fetid, carrion, the, striped, hyena, may, have, evolved, from, hyaenictitherium, namaquensis, of, pliocene, africa, striped, hyena, fossils, are, common, in, africa, with, records, going, back, as, far, as, the, villafranchian, as, fossil, striped, hyenas, are, absent, from, the, mediterranean, region, it, is, likely, that, the, species, is, a, relatively, late, invader, to, eurasia, having, likely, spread, outside, africa, only, after, the, extinction, of, spotted, hyenas, in, asia, at, the, end, of, the, ice, age, the, striped, hyena, occurred, for, some, time, in, europe, during, the, pleistocene, having, been, particularly, widespread, in, france, and, germany, it, also, occurred, in, montmaurin, hollabrunn, in, austria, the, furninha, cave, in, portugal, and, the, genista, caves, in, gibraltar, the, european, form, was, similar, in, appearance, to, modern, populations, but, was, larger, being, comparable, in, size, to, the, brown, hyena, the, spotted, hyena, crocuta, crocuta, diverged, from, the, striped, and, brown, hyena, 10, million, years, ago, its, direct, ancestor, was, the, indian, crocuta, sivalensis, which, lived, during, the, villafranchian, ancestral, spotted, hyenas, probably, developed, social, behaviours, in, response, to, increased, pressure, from, rivals, on, carcasses, thus, forcing, them, to, operate, in, teams, spotted, hyenas, evolved, sharp, carnassials, behind, their, crushing, premolars, therefore, they, did, not, need, to, wait, for, their, prey, to, die, and, thus, became, pack, hunters, as, well, as, scavengers, they, began, forming, increasingly, larger, territories, necessitated, by, the, fact, that, their, prey, was, often, migratory, and, long, chases, in, a, small, territory, would, have, caused, them, to, encroach, into, another, clan, s, turf, spotted, hyenas, spread, from, their, original, homeland, during, the, middle, pleistocene, and, quickly, colonised, a, very, wide, area, from, europe, to, southern, africa, and, china, the, eventual, disappearance, of, the, spotted, hyena, from, europe, has, traditionally, been, attributed, to, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, and, a, subsequent, displacement, of, open, grassland, by, closed, forests, which, favoured, wolves, and, humans, instead, however, analyses, have, shown, that, climate, change, alone, is, insufficient, to, explain, the, spotted, hyena, s, disappearance, from, europe, suggesting, that, other, factors, such, as, human, pressure, must, have, played, a, role, this, suggests, that, the, events, must, be, seen, within, the, broader, context, of, late, quaternary, extinctions, as, the, late, pleistocene, and, early, holocene, saw, the, disappearance, of, many, primarily, large, mammals, from, europe, and, the, world, the, list, follows, mckenna, and, bell, s, classification, of, mammals, for, prehistoric, genera, 1997, and, wozencraft, 2005, in, wilson, and, reeders, mammal, species, of, the, world, for, extant, genera, the, percrocutids, are, in, contrast, to, mckenna, and, bell, s, classification, not, included, as, a, subfamily, into, the, hyaenidae, but, as, the, separate, family, percrocutidae, though, they, are, generally, grouped, as, sister, taxa, to, hyenas, furthermore, the, living, brown, hyena, and, its, closest, extinct, relatives, are, not, included, in, the, genus, pachycrocuta, but, in, the, genus, parahyaena, however, some, research, has, suggested, parahyaena, may, be, synonymous, with, pachycrocuta, making, the, brown, hyena, the, only, extant, member, of, this, genus, the, following, cladogram, illustrates, the, phylogenetic,

relatively, short, torsos, and, are, fairly, massive, and, wolf, like, in, build, but, have, lower, hind, quarters, high, withers, and, their, backs, slope, noticeably, downward, towards, their, rumps, the, forelegs, are, high, while, the, hind, legs, are, very, short, and, their, necks, are, thick, and, short, their, skulls, superficially, resemble, those, of, large, canids, but, are, much, larger, and, heavier, with, shorter, facial, portions, hyenas, are, digitigrade, with, the, fore, and, hind, paws, having, four, digits, each, and, sporting, bulging, pawpads, like, canids, hyenas, have, short, blunt, non, retractable, claws, their, pelage, is, sparse, and, coarse, with, poorly, developed, or, absent, underfur, most, species, have, a, rich, mane, of, long, hair, running, from, the, withers, or, from, the, head, with, the, exception, of, the, spotted, hyena, hyaenids, have, striped, coats, which, they, likely, inherited, from, their, viverrid, ancestors, their, ears, are, large, and, have, simple, basal, ridges, and, no, marginal, bursa, their, vertebral, column, including, the, cervical, region, are, of, limited, mobility, hyenas, have, no, baculum, hyenas, have, one, more, pair, of, ribs, than, canids, do, and, their, tongues, are, rough, like, those, of, felids, and, viverrids, males, in, most, hyena, species, are, larger, than, females, though, the, spotted, hyena, is, an, exception, as, it, is, the, female, of, the, species, that, outweighs, and, dominates, the, male, also, unlike, other, hyenas, the, female, spotted, hyena, s, external, genitalia, closely, resembles, that, of, the, male, their, dentition, is, similar, to, that, of, the, canid, but, is, more, specialised, for, consuming, coarse, food, and, crushing, bones, the, carnassials, especially, the, upper, are, very, powerful, and, are, shifted, far, back, to, the, point, of, exertion, of, peak, pressure, on, the, jaws, the, other, teeth, save, for, the, underdeveloped, upper, molars, are, powerful, with, broad, bases, and, cutting, edges, the, canines, are, short, but, thick, and, robust, labiolingually, their, mandibles, are, much, stronger, at, the, canine, teeth, than, in, canids, reflecting, the, fact, that, hyenas, crack, bones, with, both, their, anterior, dentition, and, premolars, unlike, canids, which, do, so, with, their, post, carnassial, molars, the, strength, of, their, jaws, is, such, that, both, striped, and, spotted, hyenas, have, been, recorded, to, kill, dogs, with, a, single, bite, to, the, neck, without, breaking, the, skin, the, spotted, hyena, is, renowned, for, its, strong, bite, proportional, to, its, size, but, a, number, of, other, animals, including, the, tasmanian, devil, are, proportionately, stronger, the, aardwolf, has, greatly, reduced, cheek, teeth, sometimes, absent, in, the, adult, but, otherwise, has, the, same, dental, formula, as, the, other, three, species, the, dental, formula, for, all, hyena, species, is, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, although, hyenas, lack, perineal, scent, glands, they, have, a, large, pouch, of, naked, skin, located, at, the, anal, opening, large, anal, glands, above, the, anus, open, into, this, pouch, several, sebaceous, glands, are, present, between, the, openings, of, the, anal, glands, and, above, them, these, glands, produce, a, white, creamy, secretion, that, the, hyenas, paste, onto, grass, stalks, the, odor, of, this, secretion, is, very, strong, smelling, of, boiling, cheap, soap, or, burning, and, can, be, detected, by, humans, several, meters, downwind, the, secretions, are, primarily, used, for, territorial, marking, though, both, the, aardwolf, and, the, striped, hyena, will, spray, them, when, attacked, hyenas, groom, themselves, often, like, felids, and, viverrids, and, their, way, of, licking, their, genitals, is, very, cat, like, sitting, on, the, lower, back, legs, spread, with, one, leg, pointing, vertically, upward, they, defecate, in, the, same, manner, as, other, carnivora, though, they, never, raise, their, legs, as, canids, do, when, urinating, as, urination, serves, no, territorial, function, for, them, instead, hyenas, mark, their, territories, using, their, anal, glands, a, trait, found, also, in, viverrids, and, mustelids, but, not, canids, and, felids, when, attacked, by, lions, or, dogs, striped, and, brown, hyenas, will, feign, death, though, the, spotted, hyena, will, defend, itself, ferociously, the, spotted, hyena, is, very, vocal, producing, a, number, of, different, sounds, consisting, of, whoops, grunts, groans, lows, giggles, yells, growls, laughs, and, whines, the, striped, hyena, is, comparatively, silent, its, vocalizations, being, limited, to, a, chattering, laugh, and, howling, mating, between, hyenas, involves, a, number, of, short, copulations, with, brief, intervals, unlike, canids, who, generally, engage, in, a, single, drawn, out, copulation, spotted, hyena, cubs, are, born, almost, fully, developed, with, their, eyes, open, and, erupting, incisors, and, canines, though, lacking, adult, markings, in, contrast, striped, hyena, cubs, are, born, with, adult, markings, closed, eyes, and, small, ears, hyenas, do, not, regurgitate, food, for, their, young, and, male, spotted, hyenas, play, no, part, in, raising, their, cubs, though, male, striped, hyenas, do, so, the, striped, hyena, is, primarily, a, scavenger, though, it, will, also, attack, and, kill, any, animals, it, can, overcome, and, will, supplement, its, diet, with, fruit, the, spotted, hyena, though, it, also, scavenges, occasionally, is, an, active, pack, hunter, of, medium, to, large, sized, ungulates, which, it, catches, by, wearing, them, down, in, long, chases, and, dismembering, them, in, a, canid, like, manner, spotted, hyenas, may, kill, as, many, as, 95, of, the, animals, they, eat, the, aardwolf, is, primarily, an, insectivore, specialised, for, feeding, on, termites, of, the, genus, trinervitermes, and, hodotermes, which, it, consumes, by, licking, them, up, with, its, long, broad, tongue, an, aardwolf, can, eat, 300, 000, trinervitermes, on, a, single, outing, except, for, the, aardwolf, hyenas, are, known, to, drive, off, larger, predators, like, lions, from, their, kills, despite, having, a, reputation, in, popular, culture, for, being, cowardly, hyenas, are, primarily, nocturnal, animals, but, sometimes, venture, from, their, lairs, in, the, early, morning, hours, with, the, exception, of, the, highly, social, spotted, hyena, hyenas, are, generally, not, gregarious, animals, though, the, striped, and, brown, hyenas, may, live, in, family, groups, and, congregate, at, kills, spotted, hyenas, are, one, of, the, few, mammals, other, than, bats, known, to, survive, infection, with, rabies, virus, and, have, shown, little, or, no, disease, induced, mortality, during, outbreaks, in, sympatric, carnivores, in, part, due, to, the, high, concentration, of, antibodies, present, in, their, saliva, despite, this, perceived, unique, disease, resistance, little, is, known, about, the, immune, system, of, spotted, hyenas, and, even, less, is, known, about, other, hyaenidae, species, spotted, hyenas, vary, in, their, folkloric, and, mythological, depictions, depending, on, the, ethnic, group, from, which, the, tales, originate, it, is, often, difficult, to, know, whether, spotted, hyenas, are, the, specific, hyena, species, featured, in, such, stories, particularly, in, west, africa, as, both, spotted, and, striped, hyenas, are, often, given, the, same, names, in, west, african, tales, spotted, hyenas, are, sometimes, depicted, as, bad, muslims, who, challenge, the, local, animism, that, exists, among, the, beng, in, c, te, d, ivoire, in, east, africa, tabwa, mythology, portrays, the, spotted, hyena, as, a, solar, animal, that, first, brought, the, sun, to, warm, the, cold, earth, while, west, african, folklore, generally, shows, the, hyena, as, symbolizing, immorality, dirty, habits, the, reversal, of, normal, activities, and, other, negative, traits, in, tanzania, there, is, a, belief, that, witches, use, spotted, hyenas, as, mounts, in, the, mtwara, region, of, tanzania, it, is, believed, that, a, child, born, at, night, while, a, hyena, is, crying, will, likely, to, grow, up, to, be, a, thief, in, the, same, area, hyena, feces, are, believed, to, enable, a, child, to, walk, at, an, early, age, thus, it, is, not, uncommon, in, that, area, to, see, children, with, hyena, dung, wrapped, in, their, clothes, the, kaguru, of, tanzania, and, the, kujamaat, of, southern, senegal, view, hyenas, as, inedible, and, greedy, hermaphrodites, a, mythical, african, tribe, called, the, bouda, is, reputed, to, have, members, able, to, transform, into, hyenas, a, similar, myth, occurs, in, mans, a, these, werehyenas, are, killed, when, discovered, and, do, not, revert, to, human, form, once, dead, striped, hyenas, are, often, referred, to, in, middle, eastern, literature, and, folklore, typically, as, symbols, of, treachery, and, stupidity, in, the, near, and, middle, east, striped, hyenas, are, generally, regarded, as, physical, incarnations, of, jinns, arab, writer, al, qazw, n, 1204, 1283, spoke, of, a, tribe, of, people, called, al, aby, n, meaning, hyena, people, in, his, book, aj, ib, al, makhl, q, t, he, wrote, that, should, one, of, this, tribe, be, in, a, group, of, 1, 000, people, a, hyena, could, pick, him, out, and, eat, him, a, persian, medical, treatise, written, in, 1376, tells, how, to, cure, cannibalistic, people, known, as, kaftar, who, are, said, to, be, half, man, half, hyena, al, dam, r, in, his, writings, in, away, n, al, kubr, 1406, wrote, that, striped, hyenas, were, vampiric, creatures, that, attacked, people, at, night, and, sucked, the, blood, from, their, necks, he, also, wrote, that, hyenas, only, attacked, brave, people, arab, folklore, tells, of, how, hyenas, can, mesmerise, victims, with, their, eyes, or, sometimes, with, their, pheromones, in, a, similar, vein, to, al, dam, r, the, greeks, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, believed, that, the, bodies, of, werewolves, if, not, destroyed, would, haunt, battlefields, as, vampiric, hyenas, that, drank, the, blood, of, dying, soldiers, the, image, of, striped, hyenas, in, afghanistan, india, and, palestine, is, more, varied, though, feared, striped, hyenas, were, also, symbolic, of, love, and, fertility, leading, to, numerous, varieties, of, love, medicine, derived, from, hyena, body, parts, among, the, baluch, and, in, northern, india, witches, or, magicians, are, said, to, ride, striped, hyenas, at, night, the, striped, hyena, is, mentioned, in, the, bible, the, arabic, word, for, the, hyena, ab, or, abu, plural, ib, is, alluded, to, in, a, valley, in, israel, known, as, shaqq, ud, diba, meaning, cleft, of, the, hyenas, and, wadi, abu, diba, meaning, valley, of, the, hyenas, both, places, have, been, interpreted, by, some, scholars, as, being, the, biblical, valley, of, tsebo, im, mentioned, in, 1, samuel, 13, 18, in, modern, hebrew, the, word, for, hyena, and, hypocrite, are, both, the, same, tsavua, though, the, authorized, king, james, version, of, the, bible, interprets, the, term, ayit, tsavua, found, in, jeremiah, 12, 9, as, speckled, bird, henry, baker, tristram, argued, that, it, was, most, likely, a, hyena, being, mentioned, the, vocalization, of, the, spotted, hyena, resembling, hysterical, human, laughter, has, been, alluded, to, in, numerous, works, of, literature, to, laugh, like, a, hy, na, was, a, common, simile, and, is, featured, in, the, cobbler, s, prophecy, 1594, webster, s, duchess, of, malfy, 1623, and, shakespeare, s, as, you, like, it, act, iv, sc, 1, die, strandjutwolf, the, brown, hyena, is, an, allegorical, poem, by, the, renowned, south, african, poet, n, p, van, wyk, louw, which, evokes, a, sinister, and, ominous, presence, in, ordinary, circumstances, striped, hyenas, are, extremely, timid, around, humans, though, they, may, show, bold, behaviors, towards, people, at, night, on, rare, occasions, striped, hyenas, have, preyed, on, humans, among, hyenas, only, the, spotted, and, striped, hyenas, have, been, known, to, become, man, eaters, hyenas, are, known, to, have, preyed, on, humans, in, prehistory, human, hair, has, been, found, in, fossilized, hyena, dung, dating, back, 195, 000, to, 257, 000, years, some, paleontologists, believe, that, competition, and, predation, by, cave, hyenas, crocuta, crocuta, spelaea, in, siberia, was, a, significant, factor, in, delaying, human, colonization, of, alaska, hyenas, may, have, occasionally, stolen, human, kills, or, entered, campsites, to, drag, off, the,
