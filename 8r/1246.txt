product, the, smoking, of, pure, opium, became, more, popular, in, the, 18th, century, in, 1736, the, smoking, of, pure, opium, was, described, by, huang, shujing, involving, a, pipe, made, from, bamboo, rimmed, with, silver, stuffed, with, palm, slices, and, hair, fed, by, a, clay, bowl, in, which, a, globule, of, molten, opium, was, held, over, the, flame, of, an, oil, lamp, this, elaborate,

emperor, s, lack, of, interest, in, british, commodities, other, than, silver, british, traders, resorted, to, trade, in, opium, as, a, high, value, commodity, for, which, china, was, not, self, sufficient, the, english, traders, had, been, purchasing, small, amounts, of, opium, from, india, for, trade, since, ralph, fitch, first, visited, in, the, mid, 16th, century, trade, in, opium, was, standardized, with, production, of, balls, of, raw, opium, 1, 1, 1, 6, kg, 2, 4, 3, 5, lb, 30, water, content, wrapped, in, poppy, leaves, and, petals, and, shipped, in, chests, of, 60, 65, kg, 132, 143, lb, one, picul, chests, of, opium, were, sold, in, auctions, in, calcutta, with, the, understanding, that, the, independent, purchasers, would, then, smuggle, it, into, china, china, had, a, positive, balance, sheet, in, trading, with, the, british, which, led, to, a, decrease, of, the, british, silver, stocks, therefore, the, british, tried, to, encourage, chinese, opium, use, to, enhance, their, balance, and, they, delivered, it, from, indian, provinces, under, british, control, in, india, its, cultivation, as, well, as, the, manufacture, and, traffic, to, china, were, subject, to, the, british, east, india, company, beic, as, a, strict, monopoly, of, the, british, government, there, was, an, extensive, and, complicated, system, of, beic, agencies, involved, in, the, supervision, and, management, of, opium, production, and, distribution, in, india, bengal, opium, was, highly, prized, commanding, twice, the, price, of, the, domestic, chinese, product, which, was, regarded, as, inferior, in, quality, some, competition, came, from, the, newly, independent, united, states, which, began, to, compete, in, guangzhou, selling, turkish, opium, in, the, 1820s, portuguese, traders, also, brought, opium, from, the, independent, malwa, states, of, western, india, although, by, 1820, the, british, were, able, to, restrict, this, trade, by, charging, pass, duty, on, the, opium, when, it, was, forced, to, pass, through, bombay, to, reach, an, entrepot, despite, drastic, penalties, and, continued, prohibition, of, opium, until, 1860, opium, smuggling, rose, steadily, from, 200, chests, per, year, under, the, yongzheng, emperor, to, 1, 000, under, the, qianlong, emperor, 4, 000, under, the, jiaqing, emperor, and, 30, 000, under, the, daoguang, emperor, the, illegal, sale, of, opium, became, one, of, the, world, s, most, valuable, single, commodity, trades, and, has, been, called, the, most, long, continued, and, systematic, international, crime, of, modern, times, opium, smuggling, provided, 15, to, 20, percent, of, the, british, empire, s, revenue, and, simultaneously, caused, scarcity, of, silver, in, china, in, response, to, the, ever, growing, number, of, chinese, people, becoming, addicted, to, opium, the, qing, daoguang, emperor, took, strong, action, to, halt, the, smuggling, of, opium, including, the, seizure, of, cargo, in, 1838, the, chinese, commissioner, lin, zexu, destroyed, 20, 000, chests, of, opium, approximately, 2, 660, 000, pounds, in, guangzhou, in, a, river, given, that, a, chest, of, opium, was, worth, nearly, us, 1, 000, in, 1800, this, was, a, substantial, economic, loss, the, british, queen, victoria, not, willing, to, replace, the, cheap, opium, with, costly, silver, began, the, first, opium, war, in, 1840, the, british, winning, hong, kong, and, trade, concessions, in, the, first, of, a, series, of, unequal, treaties, the, opium, trade, incurred, intense, enmity, from, the, later, british, prime, minister, william, ewart, gladstone, as, a, member, of, parliament, gladstone, called, it, most, infamous, and, atrocious, referring, to, the, opium, trade, between, china, and, british, india, in, particular, gladstone, was, fiercely, against, both, of, the, opium, wars, britain, waged, in, china, in, the, first, opium, war, initiated, in, 1840, and, the, second, opium, war, initiated, in, 1857, denounced, british, violence, against, chinese, and, was, ardently, opposed, to, the, british, trade, in, opium, to, china, gladstone, lambasted, it, as, palmerston, s, opium, war, and, said, that, he, felt, in, dread, of, the, judgments, of, god, upon, england, for, our, national, iniquity, towards, china, in, may, 1840, a, famous, speech, was, made, by, gladstone, in, parliament, against, the, first, opium, war, gladstone, criticized, it, as, a, war, more, unjust, in, its, origin, a, war, more, calculated, in, its, progress, to, cover, this, country, with, permanent, disgrace, his, hostility, to, opium, stemmed, from, the, effects, of, opium, brought, upon, his, sister, helen, due, to, the, first, opium, war, brought, on, by, palmerston, there, was, initial, reluctance, to, join, the, government, of, peel, on, part, of, gladstone, before, 1841, following, china, s, defeat, in, the, second, opium, war, in, 1858, china, was, forced, to, legalize, opium, and, began, massive, domestic, production, importation, of, opium, peaked, in, 1879, at, 6, 700, tons, and, by, 1906, china, was, producing, 85, percent, of, the, world, s, opium, some, 35, 000, tons, and, 27, percent, of, its, adult, male, population, regularly, used, opium, 13, 5, million, people, consuming, 39, 000, tons, of, opium, yearly, from, 1880, to, the, beginning, of, the, communist, era, the, british, attempted, to, discourage, the, use, of, opium, in, china, but, this, effectively, promoted, the, use, of, morphine, heroin, and, cocaine, further, exacerbating, the, problem, of, addiction, scientific, evidence, of, the, pernicious, nature, of, opium, use, was, largely, undocumented, in, the, 1890s, when, protestant, missionaries, in, china, decided, to, strengthen, their, opposition, to, the, trade, by, compiling, data, which, would, demonstrate, the, harm, the, drug, did, faced, with, the, problem, that, many, chinese, associated, christianity, with, opium, partly, due, to, the, arrival, of, early, protestant, missionaries, on, opium, clippers, at, the, 1890, shanghai, missionary, conference, they, agreed, to, establish, the, permanent, committee, for, the, promotion, of, anti, opium, societies, in, an, attempt, to, overcome, this, problem, and, to, arouse, public, opinion, against, the, opium, trade, the, members, of, the, committee, were, john, glasgow, kerr, md, american, presbyterian, mission, in, guangzhou, canton, b, c, atterbury, md, american, presbyterian, mission, in, beijing, peking, archdeacon, arthur, e, moule, church, missionary, society, in, shanghai, henry, whitney, md, american, board, of, commissioners, for, foreign, missions, in, fuzhou, the, rev, samuel, clarke, china, inland, mission, in, guiyang, the, rev, arthur, gostick, shorrock, english, baptist, mission, in, taiyuan, and, the, rev, griffith, john, london, mission, society, in, hankou, these, missionaries, were, generally, outraged, over, the, british, government, s, royal, commission, on, opium, visiting, india, but, not, china, accordingly, the, missionaries, first, organized, the, anti, opium, league, in, china, among, their, colleagues, in, every, mission, station, in, china, american, missionary, hampden, coit, dubose, acted, as, first, president, this, organization, which, had, elected, national, officers, and, held, an, annual, national, meeting, was, instrumental, in, gathering, data, from, every, western, trained, medical, doctor, in, china, which, was, then, published, as, william, hector, park, compiled, opinions, of, over, 100, physicians, on, the, use, of, opium, in, china, shanghai, american, presbyterian, mission, press, 1899, the, vast, majority, of, these, medical, doctors, were, missionaries, the, survey, also, included, doctors, who, were, in, private, practices, particularly, in, shanghai, and, hong, kong, as, well, as, chinese, who, had, been, trained, in, medical, schools, in, western, countries, in, england, the, home, director, of, the, china, inland, mission, benjamin, broomhall, was, an, active, opponent, of, the, opium, trade, writing, two, books, to, promote, the, banning, of, opium, smoking, the, truth, about, opium, smoking, and, the, chinese, opium, smoker, in, 1888, broomhall, formed, and, became, secretary, of, the, christian, union, for, the, severance, of, the, british, empire, with, the, opium, traffic, and, editor, of, its, periodical, national, righteousness, he, lobbied, the, british, parliament, to, stop, the, opium, trade, he, and, james, laidlaw, maxwell, appealed, to, the, london, missionary, conference, of, 1888, and, the, edinburgh, missionary, conference, of, 1910, to, condemn, the, continuation, of, the, trade, when, broomhall, was, dying, his, son, marshall, read, to, him, from, the, times, the, welcome, news, that, an, agreement, had, been, signed, ensuring, the, end, of, the, opium, trade, within, two, years, official, chinese, resistance, to, opium, was, renewed, on, september, 20, 1906, with, an, antiopium, initiative, intended, to, eliminate, the, drug, problem, within, 10, years, the, program, relied, on, the, turning, of, public, sentiment, against, opium, with, mass, meetings, at, which, opium, paraphernalia, were, publicly, burned, as, well, as, coercive, legal, action, and, the, granting, of, police, powers, to, organizations, such, as, the, fujian, anti, opium, society, smokers, were, required, to, register, for, licenses, for, gradually, reducing, rations, of, the, drug, action, against, opium, farmers, centered, upon, a, highly, repressive, incarnation, of, law, enforcement, in, which, rural, populations, had, their, property, destroyed, their, land, confiscated, and, or, were, publicly, tortured, humiliated, and, executed, addicts, sometimes, turned, to, missionaries, for, treatment, for, their, addiction, though, many, associated, these, foreigners, with, the, drug, trade, the, program, was, counted, as, a, substantial, success, with, a, cessation, of, direct, british, opium, exports, to, china, but, not, hong, kong, and, most, provinces, declared, free, of, opium, production, nonetheless, the, success, of, the, program, was, only, temporary, with, opium, use, rapidly, increasing, during, the, disorder, following, the, death, of, yuan, shikai, in, 1916, opium, farming, also, increased, peaking, in, 1930, when, the, league, of, nations, singled, china, out, as, the, primary, source, of, illicit, opium, in, east, and, southeast, asia, many, local, powerholders, facilitated, the, trade, during, this, period, to, finance, conflicts, over, territory, and, political, campaigns, in, some, areas, food, crops, were, eradicated, to, make, way, for, opium, contributing, to, famines, in, guizhou, and, shaanxi, provinces, between, 1921, and, 1923, and, food, deficits, in, other, provinces, beginning, in, 1915, chinese, nationalist, groups, came, to, describe, the, period, of, military, losses, and, unequal, treaties, as, the, century, of, national, humiliation, later, defined, to, end, with, the, conclusion, of, the, chinese, civil, war, in, 1949, in, the, northern, provinces, of, ningxia, and, suiyuan, in, china, chinese, muslim, general, ma, fuxiang, both, prohibited, and, engaged, in, the, opium, trade, it, was, hoped, that, ma, fuxiang, would, have, improved, the, situation, since, chinese, muslims, were, well, known, for, opposition, to, smoking, opium, ma, fuxiang, officially, prohibited, opium, and, made, it, illegal, in, ningxia, but, the, guominjun, reversed, his, policy, by, 1933, people, from, every, level, of, society, were, abusing, the, drug, and, ningxia, was, left, in, destitution, in, 1923, an, officer, of, the, bank, of, china, from, baotou, found, out, that, ma, fuxiang, was, assisting, the, drug, trade, in, opium, which, helped, finance, his, military, expenses, he, earned, us, 2, million, from, taxing, those, sales, in, 1923, general, ma, had, been, using, the, bank, a, branch, of, the, government, of, china, s, exchequer, to, arrange, for, silver, currency, to, be, transported, to, baotou, to, use, it, to, sponsor, the, trade, the, opium, trade, under, the, chinese, communist, party, was, important, to, its, finances, in, the, 1940s, peter, vladimirov, s, diary, provided, a, first, hand, account, chen, yung, fa, provided, a, detailed, historical, account, of, how, the, opium, trade, was, essential, to, the, economy, of, yan, an, during, this, period, mitsubishi, and, mitsui, were, involved, in, the, opium, trade, during, the, japanese, occupation, of, china, mao, zedong, government, is, generally, credited, with, eradicating, both, consumption, and, production, of, opium, during, the, 1950s, using, unrestrained, repression, and, social, reform, ten, million, addicts, were, forced, into, compulsory, treatment, dealers, were, executed, and, opium, producing, regions, were, planted, with, new, crops, remaining, opium, production, shifted, south, of, the, chinese, border, into, the, golden, triangle, region, the, remnant, opium, trade, primarily, served, southeast, asia, but, spread, to, american, soldiers, during, the, vietnam, war, based, on, a, study, of, opiate, use, in, soldiers, returning, to, the, united, states, in, 1971, 20, percent, of, participants, were, dependent, enough, to, experience, withdrawal, symptoms, there, were, no, legal, restrictions, on, the, importation, or, use, of, opium, in, the, united, states, until, the, san, francisco, opium, den, ordinance, which, banned, dens, for, public, smoking, of, opium, in, 1875, a, measure, fueled, by, anti, chinese, sentiment, and, the, perception, that, whites, were, starting, to, frequent, the, dens, this, was, followed, by, an, 1891, california, law, requiring, that, narcotics, carry, warning, labels, and, that, their, sales, be, recorded, in, a, registry, amendments, to, the, california, pharmacy, and, poison, act, in, 1907, made, it, a, crime, to, sell, opiates, without, a, prescription, and, bans, on, possession, of, opium, or, opium, pipes, in, 1909, were, enacted, at, the, us, federal, level, the, legal, actions, taken, reflected, constitutional, restrictions, under, the, enumerated, powers, doctrine, prior, to, reinterpretation, of, the, commerce, clause, which, did, not, allow, the, federal, government, to, enact, arbitrary, prohibitions, but, did, permit, arbitrary, taxation, beginning, in, 1883, opium, importation, was, taxed, at, us, 6, to, us, 300, per, pound, until, the, opium, exclusion, act, of, 1909, prohibited, the, importation, of, opium, altogether, in, a, similar, manner, the, harrison, narcotics, tax, act, of, 1914, passed, in, fulfillment, of, the, international, opium, convention, of, 1912, nominally, placed, a, tax, on, the, distribution, of, opiates, but, served, as, a, de, facto, prohibition, of, the, drugs, today, opium, is, regulated, by, the, drug, enforcement, administration, under, the, controlled, substances, act, following, passage, of, a, colonial, australian, law, in, 1895, queensland, s, aboriginals, protection, and, restriction, of, the, sale, of, opium, act, 1897, addressed, opium, addiction, among, aboriginal, people, though, it, soon, became, a, general, vehicle, for, depriving, them, of, basic, rights, by, administrative, regulation, by, 1905, all, australian, states, and, territories, had, passed, similar, laws, making, prohibitions, to, opium, sale, smoking, and, possession, was, prohibited, in, 1908, hardening, of, canadian, attitudes, toward, chinese, opium, users, and, fear, of, a, spread, of, the, drug, into, the, white, population, led, to, the, effective, criminalization, of, opium, for, nonmedical, use, in, canada, between, 1908, and, the, mid, 1920s, in, 1909, the, international, opium, commission, was, founded, and, by, 1914, 34, nations, had, agreed, that, the, production, and, importation, of, opium, should, be, diminished, in, 1924, 62, nations, participated, in, a, meeting, of, the, commission, subsequently, this, role, passed, to, the, league, of, nations, and, all, signatory, nations, agreed, to, prohibit, the, import, sale, distribution, export, and, use, of, all, narcotic, drugs, except, for, medical, and, scientific, purposes, this, role, was, later, taken, up, by, the, international, narcotics, control, board, of, the, united, nations, under, article, 23, of, the, single, convention, on, narcotic, drugs, and, subsequently, under, the, convention, on, psychotropic, substances, opium, producing, nations, are, required, to, designate, a, government, agency, to, take, physical, possession, of, licit, opium, crops, as, soon, as, possible, after, harvest, and, conduct, all, wholesaling, and, exporting, through, that, agency, from, 1897, to, 1902, paul, doumer, later, president, of, france, was, governor, general, of, french, indochina, upon, his, arrival, the, colonies, were, losing, millions, of, francs, each, year, determined, to, put, them, on, a, paying, basis, he, levied, taxes, on, various, products, opium, among, them, the, vietnamese, cambodians, and, laotians, who, could, or, would, not, pay, these, taxes, lost, their, houses, and, land, and, often, became, day, laborers, evidently, resorting, to, this, means, of, gaining, income, gave, france, a, vested, interest, in, the, continuation, of, opium, use, among, the, population, of, indochina, before, the, 1920s, regulation, in, britain, was, controlled, by, pharmacists, pharmacists, who, were, found, to, have, prescribed, opium, for, illegitimate, uses, and, anyone, found, to, have, sold, opium, without, proper, qualifications, would, be, prosecuted, with, the, passing, of, the, rolleston, act, in, britain, in, 1926, doctors, were, allowed, to, prescribe, opiates, such, as, morphine, and, heroin, if, they, believed, their, patients, demonstrated, a, medical, need, because, addiction, was, viewed, as, a, medical, problem, rather, than, an, indulgence, doctors, were, permitted, to, allow, patients, to, wean, themselves, off, opiates, rather, than, cutting, off, any, opiate, use, altogether, the, passing, of, the, rolleston, act, put, the, control, of, opium, use, in, the, hands, of, medical, doctors, instead, of, pharmacists, later, in, the, 20th, century, addiction, to, opiates, especially, heroin, in, young, people, continued, to, rise, and, so, the, sale, and, prescription, of, opiates, was, limited, to, doctors, in, treatment, centers, if, these, doctors, were, found, to, be, prescribing, opiates, without, just, cause, then, they, could, lose, their, license, to, practice, or, prescribe, drugs, abuse, of, opium, in, the, united, states, began, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, was, largely, associated, with, chinese, immigrants, during, this, time, the, use, of, opium, had, little, stigma, the, drug, was, used, freely, until, 1882, when, a, law, was, passed, to, confine, opium, smoking, to, specific, dens, until, the, full, ban, on, opium, based, products, came, into, effect, just, after, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, physicians, in, the, us, considered, opium, a, miracle, drug, that, could, help, with, many, ailments, therefore, the, ban, on, said, products, was, more, a, result, of, negative, connotations, towards, its, use, and, distribution, by, chinese, immigrants, who, were, heavily, persecuted, during, this, particular, period, in, history, as, the, 19th, century, progressed, however, doctor, hamilton, wright, worked, to, decrease, the, use, of, opium, in, the, us, by, submitting, the, harrison, act, to, congress, this, act, put, taxes, and, restrictions, on, the, sale, and, prescription, of, opium, as, well, as, trying, to, stigmatize, the, opium, poppy, and, its, derivatives, as, demon, drugs, to, try, to, scare, people, away, from, them, this, act, and, the, stigma, of, a, demon, drug, on, opium, led, to, the, criminalization, of, people, that, used, opium, based, products, it, made, the, use, and, possession, of, opium, and, any, of, its, derivatives, illegal, the, restrictions, were, recently, redefined, by, the, federal, controlled, substances, act, of, 1970, opium, production, in, china, and, the, rest, of, east, asia, was, nearly, wiped, out, after, wwii, however, sustained, covert, support, by, the, united, states, central, intelligence, agency, for, the, thai, northern, army, and, the, chinese, nationalist, kuomintang, army, invading, burma, facilitated, production, and, trafficking, of, the, drug, from, southeast, asia, for, decades, with, the, region, becoming, a, major, source, of, world, supplies, during, the, communist, era, in, eastern, europe, poppy, stalks, sold, in, bundles, by, farmers, were, processed, by, users, with, household, chemicals, to, make, kompot, polish, heroin, and, poppy, seeds, were, used, to, produce, koknar, an, opiate, globally, opium, has, gradually, been, superseded, by, a, variety, of, purified, semi, synthetic, and, synthetic, opioids, with, progressively, stronger, effects, and, by, other, general, anesthetics, this, process, began, in, 1804, when, friedrich, wilhelm, adam, sert, rner, first, isolated, morphine, from, the, opium, poppy, the, process, continued, until, 1817, when, sert, rner, published, his, results, after, thirteen, years, of, research, and, a, nearly, disastrous, trial, on, himself, and, three, boys, the, great, advantage, of, purified, morphine, was, that, a, patient, could, be, treated, with, a, known, dose, whereas, with, raw, plant, material, as, gabriel, fallopius, once, lamented, if, soporifics, are, weak, they, do, not, help, if, they, are, strong, they, are, exceedingly, dangerous, morphine, was, the, first, pharmaceutical, isolated, from, a, natural, product, and, this, success, encouraged, the, isolation, of, other, alkaloids, by, 1820, isolations, of, noscapine, strychnine, veratrine, colchicine, caffeine, and, quinine, were, reported, morphine, sales, began, in, 1827, by, heinrich, emanuel, merck, of, darmstadt, and, helped, him, expand, his, family, pharmacy, into, the, merck, kgaa, pharmaceutical, company, codeine, was, isolated, in, 1832, by, pierre, jean, robiquet, the, use, of, diethyl, ether, and, chloroform, for, general, anesthesia, began, in, 1846, 1847, and, rapidly, displaced, the, use, of, opiates, and, tropane, alkaloids, from, solanaceae, due, to, their, relative, safety, heroin, the, first, semi, synthetic, opioid, was, first, synthesized, in, 1874, but, was, not, pursued, until, its, rediscovery, in, 1897, by, felix, hoffmann, at, the, bayer, pharmaceutical, company, in, elberfeld, germany, from, 1898, to, 1910, heroin, was, marketed, as, a, non, addictive, morphine, substitute, and, cough, medicine, for, children, because, the, lethal, dose, of, heroin, was, viewed, as, a, hundred, times, greater, than, its, effective, dose, heroin, was, advertised, as, a, safer, alternative, to, other, opioids, by, 1902, sales, made, up, 5, percent, of, the, company, s, profits, and, heroinism, had, attracted, media, attention, oxycodone, a, thebaine, derivative, similar, to, codeine, was, introduced, by, bayer, in, 1916, and, promoted, as, a, less, addictive, analgesic, preparations, of, the, drug, such, as, oxycodone, with, paracetamol, and, extended, release, oxycodone, remain, popular, to, this, day, a, range, of, synthetic, opioids, such, as, methadone, 1937, pethidine, 1939, fentanyl, late, 1950s, and, derivatives, thereof, have, been, introduced, and, each, is, preferred, for, certain, specialized, applications, nonetheless, morphine, remains, the, drug, of, choice, for, american, combat, medics, who, carry, packs, of, syrettes, containing, 16, milligrams, each, for, use, on, severely, wounded, soldiers, no, drug, has, been, found, that, can, match, the, painkilling, effect, of, opioids, without, also, duplicating, much, of, their, addictive, potential, opium, was, prohibited, in, many, countries, during, the, early, 20th, century, leading, to, the, modern, pattern, of, opium, production, as, a, precursor, for, illegal, recreational, drugs, or, tightly, regulated, highly, taxed, legal, prescription, drugs, in, 1980, 2, 000, tons, of, opium, supplied, all, legal, and, illegal, uses, worldwide, production, in, 2006, was, 6610, tonnes, about, one, fifth, the, level, of, production, in, 1906, since, then, opium, production, has, fallen, in, 2002, the, price, for, one, kilogram, of, opium, was, us, 300, for, the, farmer, us, 800, for, purchasers, in, afghanistan, and, us, 16, 000, on, the, streets, of, europe, before, conversion, into, heroin, opium, production, increased, considerably, surpassing, 5, 000, tons, in, 2002, and, reaching, 8, 600, tons, in, afghanistan, and, 840, tons, in, the, golden, triangle, in, 2014, the, world,

afghanistan, have, allowed, farmers, to, dig, their, wells, deeper, leading, to, a, bumper, crop, of, opium, year, after, year, in, a, 2023, report, poppy, cultivation, in, southern, afghanistan, was, reduced, by, over, 80, as, a, result, of, taliban, campaigns, to, stop, its, use, toward, opium, this, included, a, 99, reduction, of, opium, growth, in, the, helmand, province, in, november, 2023, a, u, n, report, showed, that, in, the, entirety, of, afghanistan, poppy, cultivation, dropped, by, over, 95, removing, it, from, its, place, as, being, the, world, s, largest, opium, producer, opium, poppies, are, popular, and, attractive, garden, plants, whose, flowers, vary, greatly, in, color, size, and, form, a, modest, amount, of, domestic, cultivation, in, private, gardens, is, not, usually, subject, to, legal, controls, in, part, this, tolerance, reflects, variation, in, addictive, potency, a, cultivar, for, opium, production, papaver, somniferum, l, elite, contains, 91, 2, percent, morphine, codeine, and, thebaine, in, its, latex, alkaloids, whereas, in, the, latex, of, the, condiment, cultivar, marianne, these, three, alkaloids, total, only, 14, 0, percent, the, remaining, alkaloids, in, the, latter, cultivar, are, primarily, narcotoline, and, noscapine, seed, capsules, can, be, dried, and, used, for, decorations, but, they, also, contain, morphine, codeine, and, other, alkaloids, these, pods, can, be, boiled, in, water, to, produce, a, bitter, tea, that, induces, a, long, lasting, intoxication, if, allowed, to, mature, poppy, pods, poppy, straw, can, be, crushed, and, used, to, produce, lower, quantities, of, morphinans, in, poppies, subjected, to, mutagenesis, and, selection, on, a, mass, scale, researchers, have, been, able, to, use, poppy, straw, to, obtain, large, quantities, of, oripavine, a, precursor, to, opioids, and, antagonists, such, as, naltrexone, although, millennia, older, the, production, of, poppy, head, decoctions, can, be, seen, as, a, quick, and, dirty, variant, of, the, k, b, y, poppy, straw, process, which, since, its, publication, in, 1930, has, become, the, major, method, of, obtaining, licit, opium, alkaloids, worldwide, as, discussed, in, morphine, poppy, seeds, are, a, common, and, flavorsome, topping, for, breads, and, cakes, one, gram, of, poppy, seeds, contains, up, to, 33, micrograms, of, morphine, and, 14, micrograms, of, codeine, and, the, substance, abuse, and, mental, health, services, administration, in, the, united, states, formerly, mandated, that, all, drug, screening, laboratories, use, a, standard, cutoff, of, 300, nanograms, per, milliliter, in, urine, samples, a, single, poppy, seed, roll, 0, 76, grams, of, seeds, usually, did, not, produce, a, positive, drug, test, but, a, positive, result, was, observed, from, eating, two, rolls, a, slice, of, poppy, seed, cake, containing, nearly, five, grams, of, seeds, per, slice, produced, positive, results, for, 24, hours, such, results, are, viewed, as, false, positive, indications, of, drug, use, and, were, the, basis, of, a, legal, defense, on, november, 30, 1998, the, standard, cutoff, was, increased, to, 2000, nanograms, two, micrograms, per, milliliter, confirmation, by, gas, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, will, distinguish, amongst, opium, and, variants, including, poppy, seeds, heroin, and, morphine, and, codeine, pharmaceuticals, by, measuring, the, morphine, codeine, ratio, and, looking, for, the, presence, of, noscapine, and, acetylcodeine, the, latter, of, which, is, only, found, in, illicitly, produced, heroin, and, heroin, metabolites, such, as, 6, monoacetylmorphine, when, grown, for, opium, production, the, skin, of, the, ripening, pods, of, these, poppies, is, scored, by, a, sharp, blade, at, a, time, carefully, chosen, so, that, rain, wind, and, dew, cannot, spoil, the, exudation, of, white, milky, latex, usually, in, the, afternoon, incisions, are, made, while, the, pods, are, still, raw, with, no, more, than, a, slight, yellow, tint, and, must, be, shallow, to, avoid, penetrating, hollow, inner, chambers, or, loculi, while, cutting, into, the, lactiferous, vessels, in, the, indian, subcontinent, afghanistan, central, asia, and, iran, the, special, tool, used, to, make, the, incisions, is, called, a, nushtar, or, nishtar, from, persian, meaning, a, lancet, and, carries, three, or, four, blades, three, millimeters, apart, which, are, scored, upward, along, the, pod, incisions, are, made, three, or, four, times, at, intervals, of, two, to, three, days, and, each, time, the, poppy, tears, which, dry, to, a, sticky, brown, resin, are, collected, the, following, morning, one, acre, harvested, in, this, way, can, produce, three, to, five, kilograms, of, raw, opium, in, the, soviet, union, pods, were, typically, scored, horizontally, and, opium, was, collected, three, times, or, else, one, or, two, collections, were, followed, by, isolation, of, opiates, from, the, ripe, capsules, oil, poppies, an, alternative, strain, of, p, somniferum, were, also, used, for, production, of, opiates, from, their, capsules, and, stems, a, traditional, chinese, method, of, harvesting, opium, latex, involved, cutting, off, the, heads, and, piercing, them, with, a, coarse, needle, then, collecting, the, dried, opium, 24, to, 48, hours, later, raw, opium, may, be, sold, to, a, merchant, or, broker, on, the, black, market, but, it, usually, does, not, travel, far, from, the, field, before, it, is, refined, into, morphine, base, because, pungent, jelly, like, raw, opium, is, bulkier, and, harder, to, smuggle, crude, laboratories, in, the, field, are, capable, of, refining, opium, into, morphine, base, by, a, simple, acid, base, extraction, a, sticky, brown, paste, morphine, base, is, pressed, into, bricks, and, sun, dried, and, can, either, be, smoked, prepared, into, other, forms, or, processed, into, heroin, other, methods, of, preparation, besides, smoking, include, processing, into, regular, opium, tincture, tinctura, opii, laudanum, paregoric, tinctura, opii, camphorata, herbal, wine, e, g, vinum, opii, opium, powder, pulvis, opii, opium, sirup, sirupus, opii, and, opium, extract, extractum, opii, vinum, opii, is, made, by, combining, sugar, white, wine, cinnamon, and, cloves, opium, syrup, is, made, by, combining, 97, 5, part, sugar, syrup, with, 2, 5, parts, opium, extract, opium, extract, extractum, opii, finally, can, be, made, by, macerating, raw, opium, with, water, to, make, opium, extract, 20, parts, water, are, combined, with, 1, part, raw, opium, which, has, been, boiled, for, 5, minutes, the, latter, to, ease, mixing, heroin, is, widely, preferred, because, of, increased, potency, one, study, in, postaddicts, found, heroin, to, be, approximately, 2, 2, times, more, potent, than, morphine, by, weight, with, a, similar, duration, at, these, relative, quantities, they, could, distinguish, the, drugs, subjectively, but, had, no, preference, heroin, was, also, found, to, be, twice, as, potent, as, morphine, in, surgical, anesthesia, morphine, is, converted, into, heroin, by, a, simple, chemical, reaction, with, acetic, anhydride, followed, by, purification, especially, in, mexican, production, opium, may, be, converted, directly, to, black, tar, heroin, in, a, simplified, procedure, this, form, predominates, in, the, u, s, west, of, the, mississippi, relative, to, other, preparations, of, heroin, it, has, been, associated, with, a, dramatically, decreased, rate, of, hiv, transmission, among, intravenous, drug, users, 4, percent, in, los, angeles, vs, 40, percent, in, new, york, due, to, technical, requirements, of, injection, although, it, is, also, associated, with, greater, risk, of, venous, sclerosis, and, necrotizing, fasciitis, afghanistan, was, formerly, the, primary, producer, of, the, drug, having, regularly, producing, 70, percent, of, the, world, s, opium, afghanistan, decreased, production, to, 74, tons, per, year, under, a, ban, by, the, taliban, in, 2000, a, move, which, cut, production, by, 94, percent, a, year, later, after, american, and, british, troops, invaded, afghanistan, removed, the, taliban, and, installed, the, interim, government, the, land, under, cultivation, leapt, back, to, 285, square, miles, 740, km, 2, with, afghanistan, supplanting, burma, to, become, the, world, s, largest, opium, producer, once, more, opium, production, increased, rapidly, in, afghanistan, from, that, point, reaching, an, all, time, high, in, 2006, according, to, dea, statistics, afghanistan, s, production, of, oven, dried, opium, increased, to, 1, 278, tons, in, 2002, more, than, doubled, by, 2003, and, nearly, doubled, again, during, 2004, in, late, 2004, the, u, s, government, estimated, that, 206, 000, hectares, were, under, poppy, cultivation, 4, 5, percent, of, the, country, s, total, cropland, and, produced, 4, 200, metric, tons, of, opium, 76, percent, of, the, world, s, supply, yielding, 60, percent, of, afghanistan, s, gross, domestic, product, in, 2006, the, un, office, on, drugs, and, crime, estimated, production, to, have, risen, 59, percent, to, 165, 000, hectares, 407, 000, acres, in, cultivation, yielding, 6, 100, tons, of, opium, 82, percent, of, the, world, s, supply, the, value, of, the, resulting, heroin, was, estimated, at, us, 3, 5, billion, of, which, afghan, farmers, were, estimated, to, have, received, us, 700, million, in, revenue, for, farmers, the, crop, can, be, up, to, ten, times, more, profitable, than, wheat, the, price, of, opium, is, around, us, 138, per, kilo, opium, production, has, led, to, rising, tensions, in, afghan, villages, though, direct, conflict, has, yet, to, occur, the, opinions, of, the, new, class, of, young, rich, men, involved, in, the, opium, trade, are, at, odds, with, those, of, the, traditional, village, leaders, an, increasingly, large, fraction, of, opium, is, processed, into, morphine, base, and, heroin, in, drug, labs, in, afghanistan, despite, an, international, set, of, chemical, controls, designed, to, restrict, availability, of, acetic, anhydride, it, enters, the, country, perhaps, through, its, central, asian, neighbors, which, do, not, participate, a, counternarcotics, law, passed, in, december, 2005, requires, afghanistan, to, develop, registries, or, regulations, for, tracking, storing, and, owning, acetic, anhydride, in, november, 2023, a, u, n, report, showed, that, in, the, entirety, of, afghanistan, poppy, cultivation, dropped, by, over, 95, removing, it, from, its, place, as, being, the, world, s, largest, opium, producer, besides, afghanistan, smaller, quantities, of, opium, are, produced, in, pakistan, the, golden, triangle, region, of, southeast, asia, particularly, burma, colombia, guatemala, and, mexico, chinese, production, mainly, trades, with, and, profits, from, north, america, in, 2002, they, were, seeking, to, expand, through, eastern, united, states, in, the, post, 9, 11, era, trading, between, borders, became, difficult, and, because, new, international, laws, were, set, into, place, the, opium, trade, became, more, diffused, power, shifted, from, remote, to, high, end, smugglers, and, opium, traders, outsourcing, became, a, huge, factor, for, survival, for, many, smugglers, and, opium, farmers, in, 2023, burma, overtook, afghanistan, and, became, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, opium, producing, 1080, metric, tones, according, the, un, southeast, asia, opium, survey, report, legal, opium, production, is, allowed, under, the, united, nations, single, convention, on, narcotic, drugs, and, other, international, drug, treaties, subject, to, strict, supervision, by, the, law, enforcement, agencies, of, individual, countries, the, leading, legal, production, method, is, the, robertson, gregory, process, whereby, the, entire, poppy, excluding, roots, and, leaves, is, mashed, and, stewed, in, dilute, acid, solutions, the, alkaloids, are, then, recovered, via, acid, base, extraction, and, purified, the, exact, date, of, its, discovery, is, unknown, but, it, was, described, by, wurtz, in, his, dictionnaire, de, chimie, pure, et, appliqu, e, published, in, 1868, legal, opium, production, in, india, is, much, more, traditional, as, of, 2008, opium, was, collected, by, farmers, who, were, licensed, to, grow, 0, 1, hectares, 0, 25, acres, of, opium, poppies, who, to, maintain, their, licences, needed, to, sell, 56, kilograms, of, unadulterated, raw, opium, paste, the, price, of, opium, paste, is, fixed, by, the, government, according, to, the, quality, and, quantity, tendered, the, average, is, around, 1500, rupees, us, 29, per, kilogram, some, additional, money, is, made, by, drying, the, poppy, heads, and, collecting, poppy, seeds, and, a, small, fraction, of, opium, beyond, the, quota, may, be, consumed, locally, or, diverted, to, the, black, market, the, opium, paste, is, dried, and, processed, into, government, opium, and, alkaloid, factories, before, it, is, packed, into, cases, of, 60, kilograms, for, export, purification, of, chemical, constituents, is, done, in, india, for, domestic, production, but, typically, done, abroad, by, foreign, importers, legal, opium, importation, from, india, and, turkey, is, conducted, by, mallinckrodt, noramco, abbott, laboratories, purdue, pharma, and, cody, laboratories, inc, in, the, united, states, and, legal, opium, production, is, conducted, by, glaxosmithkline, johnson, johnson, johnson, matthey, and, mayne, in, tasmania, australia, sanofi, aventis, in, france, shionogi, pharmaceutical, in, japan, and, macfarlan, smith, in, the, united, kingdom, the, un, treaty, requires, that, every, country, submit, annual, reports, to, the, international, narcotics, control, board, stating, that, year, s, actual, consumption, of, many, classes, of, controlled, drugs, as, well, as, opioids, and, projecting, required, quantities, for, the, next, year, this, is, to, allow, trends, in, consumption, to, be, monitored, and, production, quotas, allotted, in, 2005, the, european, senlis, council, began, developing, a, programme, which, hopes, to, solve, the, problems, caused, by, the, large, quantity, of, opium, produced, illegally, in, afghanistan, most, of, which, is, converted, to, heroin, and, smuggled, for, sale, in, europe, and, the, united, states, this, proposal, is, to, license, afghan, farmers, to, produce, opium, for, the, world, pharmaceutical, market, and, thereby, solve, another, problem, that, of, chronic, underuse, of, potent, analgesics, where, required, within, developing, nations, part, of, the, proposal, is, to, overcome, the, 80, 20, rule, that, requires, the, u, s, to, purchase, 80, percent, of, its, legal, opium, from, india, and, turkey, to, include, afghanistan, by, establishing, a, second, tier, system, of, supply, control, that, complements, the, current, incb, regulated, supply, and, demand, system, by, providing, poppy, based, medicines, to, countries, who, cannot, meet, their, demand, under, the, current, regulations, senlis, arranged, a, conference, in, kabul, that, brought, drug, policy, experts, from, around, the, world, to, meet, with, afghan, government, officials, to, discuss, internal, security, corruption, issues, and, legal, issues, within, afghanistan, in, june, 2007, the, council, launched, a, poppy, for, medicines, project, that, provides, a, technical, blueprint, for, the, implementation, of, an, integrated, control, system, within, afghan, village, based, poppy, for, medicine, projects, the, idea, promotes, the, economic, diversification, by, redirecting, proceeds, from, the, legal, cultivation, of, poppy, and, production, of, poppy, based, medicines, there, has, been, criticism, of, the, senlis, report, findings, by, macfarlan, smith, who, argue, that, though, they, produce, morphine, in, europe, they, were, never, asked, to, contribute, to, the, report, in, late, 2006, the, british, government, permitted, the, pharmaceutical, company, macfarlan, smith, a, johnson, matthey, company, to, cultivate, opium, poppies, in, england, for, medicinal, reasons, after, macfarlan, smith, s, primary, source, india, decided, to, increase, the, price, of, export, opium, latex, this, move, is, well, received, by, british, farmers, with, a, major, opium, poppy, field, located, in, didcot, england, the, british, government, has, contradicted, the, home, office, s, suggestion, that, opium, cultivation, can, be, legalized, in, afghanistan, for, exports, to, the, united, kingdom, helping, lower, poverty, and, internal, fighting, while, helping, the, nhs, to, meet, the, high, demand, for, morphine, and, heroin, opium, poppy, cultivation, in, the, united, kingdom, does, not, need, a, licence, but, a, licence, is, required, for, those, wishing, to, extract, opium, for, medicinal, products, in, the, industrialized, world, the, united, states, is, the, world, s, biggest, consumer, of, prescription, opioids, with, italy, being, one, of, the, lowest, because, of, tighter, regulations, on, prescribing, narcotics, for, pain, relief, most, opium, imported, into, the, united, states, is, broken, down, into, its, alkaloid, constituents, and, whether, legal, or, illegal, most, current, drug, use, occurs, with, processed, derivatives, such, as, heroin, rather, than, with, unrefined, opium, intravenous, injection, of, opiates, is, most, used, by, comparison, with, injection, dragon, chasing, heating, of, heroin, on, a, piece, of, foil, and, madak, and, ack, ack, smoking, of, cigarettes, containing, tobacco, mixed, with, heroin, powder, are, only, 40, percent, and, 20, percent, efficient, respectively, one, study, of, british, heroin, addicts, found, a, 12, fold, excess, mortality, ratio, 1, 8, percent, of, the, group, dying, per, year, most, heroin, deaths, result, not, from, overdose, per, se, but, combination, with, other, depressant, drugs, such, as, alcohol, or, benzodiazepines, the, smoking, of, opium, does, not, involve, the, burning, of, the, material, as, might, be, imagined, rather, the, prepared, opium, is, indirectly, heated, to, temperatures, at, which, the, active, alkaloids, chiefly, morphine, are, vaporized, in, the, past, smokers, would, use, a, specially, designed, opium, pipe, which, had, a, removable, knob, like, pipe, bowl, of, fired, earthenware, attached, by, a, metal, fitting, to, a, long, cylindrical, stem, a, small, pill, of, opium, about, the, size, of, a, pea, would, be, placed, on, the, pipe, bowl, which, was, then, heated, by, holding, it, over, an, opium, lamp, a, special, oil, lamp, with, a, distinct, funnel, like, chimney, to, channel, heat, into, a, small, area, the, smoker, would, lie, on, his, or, her, side, in, order, to, guide, the, pipe, bowl, and, the, tiny, pill, of, opium, over, the, stream, of, heat, rising, from, the, chimney, of, the, oil, lamp, and, inhale, the, vaporized, opium, fumes, as, needed, several, pills, of, opium, were, smoked, at, a, single, session, depending, on, the, smoker, s, tolerance, to, the, drug, the, effects, could, last, up, to, twelve, hours, in, eastern, culture, opium, is, more, commonly, used, in, the, form, of, paregoric, to, treat, diarrhea, this, is, a, weaker, solution, than, laudanum, an, alcoholic, tincture, which, was, prevalently, used, as, a, pain, medication, and, sleeping, aid, tincture, of, opium, has, been, prescribed, for, among, other, things, severe, diarrhea, taken, thirty, minutes, prior, to, meals, it, significantly, slows, intestinal, motility, giving, the, intestines, greater, time, to, absorb, fluid, in, the, stool, despite, the, historically, negative, view, of, opium, as, a, cause, of, addiction, the, use, of, morphine, and, other, derivatives, isolated, from, opium, in, the, treatment, of, chronic, pain, has, been, reestablished, if, given, in, controlled, doses, modern, opiates, can, be, an, effective, treatment, for, neuropathic, pain, and, other, forms, of, chronic, pain, opium, contains, two, main, groups, of, alkaloids, phenanthrenes, such, as, morphine, codeine, and, thebaine, are, the, main, psychoactive, constituents, isoquinolines, such, as, papaverine, and, noscapine, have, no, significant, central, nervous, system, effects, morphine, is, the, most, prevalent, and, important, alkaloid, in, opium, consisting, of, 10, 16, percent, of, the, total, and, is, responsible, for, most, of, its, harmful, effects, such, as, lung, edema, respiratory, difficulties, coma, or, cardiac, or, respiratory, collapse, morphine, binds, to, and, activates, mu, opioid, receptors, in, the, brain, spinal, cord, stomach, and, intestine, regular, use, can, lead, to, drug, tolerance, or, physical, dependence, chronic, opium, addicts, in, 1906, china, consumed, an, average, of, eight, grams, of, opium, daily, opium, addicts, in, modern, iran, are, thought, to, consume, about, the, same, both, analgesia, and, drug, addiction, are, functions, of, the, mu, opioid, receptor, the, class, of, opioid, receptor, first, identified, as, responsive, to, morphine, tolerance, is, associated, with, the, superactivation, of, the, receptor, which, may, be, affected, by, the, degree, of, endocytosis, caused, by, the, opioid, administered, and, leads, to, a, superactivation, of, cyclic, amp, signaling, long, term, use, of, morphine, in, palliative, care, and, the, management, of, chronic, pain, always, entails, a, risk, that, the, patient, develops, tolerance, or, physical, dependence, there, are, many, kinds, of, rehabilitation, treatment, including, pharmacologically, based, treatments, with, naltrexone, methadone, or, ibogaine, in, 2021, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, concluded, that, opium, is, a, group, 1, sufficient,

dope, and, tar, can, also, refer, to, heroin, the, traditional, opium, pipe, is, known, as, a, dream, stick, the, term, dope, entered, the, english, language, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, originally, referring, to, viscous, liquids, particularly, sauces, or, gravy, it, has, been, used, to, refer, to, opiates, since, at, least, 1888, and, this, usage, arose, because, opium, when, prepared, for, smoking, is, viscous
