the, abdomen, colloquially, called, the, belly, tummy, midriff, tucky, or, stomach, is, the, front, part, of, the, torso, between, the, thorax, chest, and, pelvis, in, humans, and, in, other, vertebrates, the, area, occupied, by, the, abdomen, is, called, the, abdominal, cavity, in, arthropods, it, is, the, posterior, tagma, of, the, body, it, follows, the, thorax, or, cephalothorax, in, humans, the, abdomen, stretches, from, the, thorax, at, the, thoracic, diaphragm, to, the, pelvis, at, the, pelvic, brim, the, pelvic, brim, stretches, from, the, lumbosacral, joint, the, intervertebral, disc, between, l5, and, s1, to, the, pubic, symphysis, and, is, the, edge, of, the, pelvic, inlet, the, space, above, this, inlet, and, under, the, thoracic, diaphragm, is, termed, the, abdominal, cavity, the, boundary, of, the, abdominal, cavity, is, the, abdominal, wall, in, the, front, and, the, peritoneal, surface, at, the, rear, in, vertebrates, the, abdomen, is, a, large, body, cavity, enclosed, by, the, abdominal, muscles, at, the, front, and, to, the, sides, and, by, part, of, the, vertebral, column, at, the, back, lower, ribs, can, also, enclose, ventral, and, lateral, walls, the, abdominal, cavity, is, continuous, with, and, above, the, pelvic, cavity, it, is, attached, to, the, thoracic, cavity, by, the, diaphragm, structures, such, as, the, aorta, inferior, vena, cava, and, esophagus, pass, through, the, diaphragm, both, the, abdominal, and, pelvic, cavities, are, lined, by, a, serous, membrane, known, as, the, parietal, peritoneum, this, membrane, is, continuous, with, the, visceral, peritoneum, lining, the, organs, the, abdomen, in, vertebrates, contains, a, number, of, organs, belonging, to, for, instance, the, digestive, system, urinary, system, and, muscular, system, the, abdominal, cavity, contains, most, organs, of, the, digestive, system, including, the, stomach, the, small, intestine, and, the, colon, with, its, attached, appendix, other, digestive, organs, are, known, as, the, accessory, digestive, organs, and, include, the, liver, its, attached, gallbladder, and, the, pancreas, and, these, communicate, with, the, rest, of, the, system, via, various, ducts, the, spleen, and, organs, of, the, urinary, system, including, the, kidneys, and, adrenal, glands, also, lie, within, the, abdomen, along, with, many, blood, vessels, including, the, aorta, and, inferior, vena, cava, the, urinary, bladder, uterus, fallopian, tubes, and, ovaries, may, be, seen, as, either, abdominal, organs, or, as, pelvic, organs, finally, the, abdomen, contains, an, extensive, membrane, called, the, peritoneum, a, fold, of, peritoneum, may, completely, cover, certain, organs, whereas, it, may, cover, only, one, side, of, organs, that, usually, lie, closer, to, the, abdominal, wall, this, is, called, the, retroperitoneum, and, the, kidneys, and, ureters, are, known, as, retroperitoneal, organs, there, are, three, layers, of, muscles, in, the, abdominal, wall, they, are, from, the, outside, to, the, inside, external, oblique, internal, oblique, and, transverse, abdominal, the, first, three, layers, extend, between, the, vertebral, column, the, lower, ribs, the, iliac, crest, and, pubis, of, the, hip, all, of, their, fibers, merge, towards, the, midline, and, surround, the, rectus, abdominis, in, a, sheath, before, joining, up, on, the, opposite, side, at, the, linea, alba, strength, is, gained, by, the, criss, crossing, of, fibers, such, that, the, external, oblique, runs, downward, and, forward, the, internal, oblique, upward, and, forward, and, the, transverse, abdominal, horizontally, forward, the, transverse, abdominal, muscle, is, flat, and, triangular, with, its, fibers, running, horizontally, it, lies, between, the, internal, oblique, and, the, underlying, transverse, fascia, it, originates, from, the, inguinal, ligament, costal, cartilages, 7, 12, the, iliac, crest, and, thoracolumbar, fascia, inserts, into, the, conjoint, tendon, xiphoid, process, linea, alba, and, the, pubic, crest, the, rectus, abdominis, muscles, are, long, and, flat, the, muscle, is, crossed, by, three, fibrous, bands, called, the, tendinous, intersections, the, rectus, abdominis, is, enclosed, in, a, thick, sheath, formed, as, described, above, by, fibers, from, each, of, the, three, muscles, of, the, lateral, abdominal, wall, they, originate, at, the, pubis, bone, run, up, the, abdomen, on, either, side, of, the, linea, alba, and, insert, into, the, cartilages, of, the, fifth, sixth, and, seventh, ribs, in, the, region, of, the, groin, the, inguinal, canal, is, a, passage, through, the, layers, this, gap, is, where, the, testes, can, drop, through, the, wall, and, where, the, fibrous, cord, from, the, uterus, in, the, female, runs, this, is, also, where, weakness, can, form, and, cause, inguinal, hernias, the, pyramidalis, muscle, is, small, and, triangular, it, is, located, in, the, lower, abdomen, in, front, of, the, rectus, abdominis, it, originates, at, the, pubic, bone, and, is, inserted, into, the, linea, alba, halfway, up, to, the, navel, functionally, the, human, abdomen, is, where, most, of, the, digestive, tract, is, placed, and, so, most, of, the, absorption, and, digestion, of, food, occurs, here, the, alimentary, tract, in, the, abdomen, consists, of, the, lower, esophagus, the, stomach, the, duodenum, the, jejunum, ileum, the, cecum, and, the, appendix, the, ascending, transverse, and, descending, colons, the, sigmoid, colon, and, the, rectum, other, vital, organs, inside, the, abdomen, include, the, liver, the, kidneys, the, pancreas, and, the, spleen, the, abdominal, wall, is, split, into, the, posterior, back, lateral, sides, and, anterior, front, walls, the, abdominal, muscles, have, different, important, functions, they, assist, as, muscles, of, exhalation, in, the, breathing, process, during, forceful, exhalation, moreover, these, muscles, serve, as, protection, for, the, inner, organs, furthermore, together, with, the, back, muscles, they, provide, postural, support, and, are, important, in, defining, the, form, when, the, glottis, is, closed, and, the, thorax, and, pelvis, are, fixed, they, are, integral, in, the, cough, urination, defecation, childbirth, vomit, and, singing, functions, when, the, pelvis, is, fixed, they, can, initiate, the, movement, of, the, trunk, in, a, forward, motion, they, also, prevent, hyperextension, when, the, thorax, is, fixed, they, can, pull, up, the, pelvis, and, finally, they, can, bend, the, vertebral, column, sideways, and, assist, in, the, trunk, s, rotation, the, transverse, abdominis, muscle, is, the, deepest, muscle, therefore, it, cannot, be, touched, from, the, outside, it, can, greatly, affect, the, body, s, posture, the, internal, obliques, are, also, deep, and, also, affect, body, posture, both, of, them, are, involved, in, rotation, and, lateral, flexion, of, the, spine, and, are, used, to, bend, and, support, the, spine, from, the, front, the, external, obliques, are, more, superficial, and, are, also, involved, in, rotation, and, lateral, flexion, of, the, spine, they, also, stabilize, the, spine, when, upright, the, rectus, abdominis, muscle, is, not, the, most, superficial, abdominal, muscle, the, tendonous, sheath, extending, from, the, external, obliques, cover, the, rectus, abdominis, the, rectus, abdominis, is, the, muscle, that, very, fit, people, develop, into, six, pack, abs, though, there, are, five, vertical, sections, on, each, side, the, two, bottom, sections, are, just, above, the, pubic, bone, and, usually, not, visible, the, rectus, abdominals, function, is, to, bend, one, s, back, forward, flexion, the, main, work, of, the, abdominal, muscles, is, to, bend, the, spine, forward, when, contracting, concentrically, social, and, cultural, perceptions, of, the, outward, appearance, of, the, abdomen, has, varying, significance, around, the, world, depending, on, the, type, of, society, excess, weight, can, be, perceived, as, an, indicator, of, wealth, and, prestige, due, to, excess, food, or, as, a, sign, of, poor, health, due, to, lack, of, exercise, in, many, cultures, bare, abdomens, are, distinctly, sexualized, and, perceived, similarly, to, breast, cleavage, being, key, elements, of, spinal, support, and, contributors, to, good, posture, it, is, important, to, properly, exercise, the, abdominal, muscles, together, with, the, back, muscles, because, when, these, are, weak, or, overly, tight, they, can, suffer, painful, spasms, and, injuries, when, properly, exercised, abdominal, muscles, contribute, to, improved, posture, and, balance, reduce, the, likelihood, of, back, pain, episodes, reduce, the, severity, of, back, pain, protect, against, injury, help, avoid, some, back, surgeries, and, help, with, the, healing, of, back, problems, or, after, spine, surgery, when, strengthened, the, abdominal, muscles, provide, flexibility, as, well, the, abdominal, muscles, can, be, worked, by, strength, and, fitness, exercises, and, through, practicing, disciplines, of, general, body, strength, such, as, pilates, yoga, tai, chi, and, jogging, abdominal, obesity, is, a, condition, where, abdominal, fat, or, visceral, fat, has, built, up, excessively, between, the, abdominal, organs, this, is, associated, with, a, higher, risk, of, heart, disease, asthma, and, type, 2, diabetes, abdominal, trauma, is, an, injury, to, the, abdomen, and, can, involve, damage, to, the, abdominal, organs, there, is, an, associated, risk, of, severe, blood, loss, and, infection, injury, to, the, lower, chest, can, cause, injuries, to, the, spleen, and, liver, a, scaphoid, abdomen, is, when, the, abdomen, is, sucked, inwards, in, a, newborn, it, may, represent, a, diaphragmatic, hernia, in, general, it, is, indicative, of, malnutrition, many, gastrointestinal, diseases, affect, the, abdominal, organs, these, include, stomach, disease, liver, disease, pancreatic, disease, gallbladder, and, bile, duct, disease, intestinal, diseases, include, enteritis, coeliac, disease, diverticulitis, and, irritable, bowel, syndrome, different, medical, procedures, can, be, used, to, examine, the, organs, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, these, include, endoscopy, colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, enteroscopy, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, and, virtual, colonoscopy, there, are, also, a, number, of, medical, imaging, techniques, that, can, be, used, surface, landmarks, are, important, in, the, examination, of, the, abdomen, in, the, mid, line, a, slight, furrow, extends, from, the, xiphoid, process, above, to, the, pubic, symphysis, below, representing, the, linea, alba, in, the, abdominal, wall, at, about, its, midpoint, sits, the, umbilicus, or, navel, the, rectus, abdominis, on, each, side, of, the, linea, alba, stands, out, in, muscular, people, the, outline, of, these, muscles, is, interrupted, by, three, or, more, transverse, depressions, indicating, the, tendinous, intersections, there, is, usually, one, about, the, xiphoid, process, one, at, the, navel, and, one, in, between, it, is, the, combination, of, the, linea, alba, and, the, tendinous, intersections, which, form, the, abdominal, six, pack, sought, after, by, many, people, the, upper, lateral, limit, of, the, abdomen, is, the, subcostal, margin, at, or, near, the, subcostal, plane, formed, by, the, cartilages, of, the, false, ribs, 8, 9, 10, joining, one, another, the, lower, lateral, limit, is, the, anterior, crest, of, the, ilium, and, poupart, s, ligament, which, runs, from, the, anterior, superior, spine, of, the, ilium, to, the, spine, of, the, pubis, these, lower, limits, are, marked, by, visible, grooves, just, above, the, pubic, spines, on, either, side, are, the, external, abdominal, rings, which, are, openings, in, the, muscular, wall, of, the, abdomen, through, which, the, spermatic, cord, emerges, in, the, male, and, through, which, an, inguinal, hernia, may, rupture, one, method, by, which, the, location, of, the, abdominal, contents, can, be, appreciated, is, to, draw, three, horizontal, and, two, vertical, lines, the, two, vertical, or, mid, poupart, lines, are, drawn, from, the, point, midway, between, the, anterior, superior, spine, and, the, pubic, symphysis, on, each, side, vertically, upward, to, the, costal, margin, the, right, subcostal, margin, corresponds, to, the, lower, limit, of, the, liver, while, the, right, nipple, is, about, half, an, inch, above, its, upper, limit, the, abdomen, can, be, divided, into, quadrants, or, regions, to, describe, the, location, of, an, organ, or, structure, classically, quadrants, are, described, as, the, left, upper, left, lower, right, upper, and, right, lower, quadrants, are, also, often, used, in, describing, the, site, of, an, abdominal, pain, the, abdomen, can, also, be, divided, into, nine, regions, these, terms, stem, from, hypo, meaning, below, and, epi, means, above, while, chondron, means, cartilage, in, this, case, the, cartilage, of, the, rib, and, gaster, means, stomach, the, reversal, of, left, and, right, is, intentional, because, the, anatomical, designations, reflect, the, patient, s, own, right, and, left, the, right, iliac, fossa, rif, is, a, common, site, of, pain, and, tenderness, in, patients, who, have, appendicitis, the, fossa, is, named, for, the, underlying, iliac, fossa, of, the, hip, bone, and, thus, is, somewhat, imprecise, most, of, the, anatomical, structures, that, will, produce, pain, and, tenderness, in, this, region, are, not, in, fact, in, the, concavity, of, the, ileum, however, the, term, is, in, common, usage, in, arthropods, the, abdomen, is, built, up, of, a, series, of, upper, plates, known, as, tergites, and, lower, plates, known, as, sternites, the, whole, being, held, together, by, a, tough, yet, stretchable, membrane, in, insects, the, abdomen, contains, the, insect, s, digestive, tract, and, reproductive, organs, it, consists, of, eleven, segments, in, most, orders, of, insects, though, the, eleventh, segment, is, absent, in, the, adult, of, most, higher, orders, the, number, of, these, segments, does, vary, from, species, to, species, with, the, number, of, segments, visible, reduced, to, only, seven, in, the, common, honey, bee, in, the, collembola, springtails, the, abdomen, has, only, six, segments, the, abdomen, is, sometimes, highly, modified, in, apocrita, bees, ants, and, wasps, the, first, segment, of, the, abdomen, is, fused, to, the, thorax, and, is, called, the, propodeum, in, ants, the, second, segment, forms, the, narrow, petiole, some, ants, have, an, additional, postpetiole, segment, and, the, remaining, segments, form, the, bulbous, gaster, the, petiole, and, gaster, abdominal, segments, 2, and, onward, are, collectively, called, the, metasoma, unlike, other, arthropods, insects, possess, no, legs, on, the, abdomen, in, adult, form, though, the, protura, do, have, rudimentary, leg, like, appendages, on, the, first, three, abdominal, segments, and, archaeognatha, possess, small, articulated, styli, which, are, sometimes, considered, to, be, rudimentary, appendages, many, larval, insects, including, the, lepidoptera, and, the, symphyta, sawflies, have, fleshy, appendages, called, prolegs, on, their, abdominal, segments, as, well, as, their, more, familiar, thoracic, legs, which, allow, them, to, grip, onto, the, edges, of, plant, leaves, as, they, walk, around, in, arachnids, spiders, scorpions, and, relatives, the, term, abdomen, is, used, interchangeably, with, opisthosoma, hind, body, which, is, the, body, section, posterior, to, that, bearing, the, legs, and, head, the, prosoma, or, cephalothorax, abdominal, organs, can, be, highly, specialized, in, some, animals, for, example, the, stomach, of, ruminants, a, suborder, of, mammals, that, includes, cattle, and, sheep, is, divided, into, four, chambers, rumen, reticulum, omasum, and, abomasum
