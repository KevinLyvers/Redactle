see, text, rubiaceae, r, u, b, i, e, s, i, i, s, i, a, is, a, family, of, flowering, plants, commonly, known, as, the, coffee, madder, or, bedstraw, family, it, consists, of, terrestrial, trees, shrubs, lianas, or, herbs, that, are, recognizable, by, simple, opposite, leaves, with, interpetiolar, stipules, and, sympetalous, actinomorphic, flowers, the, family, contains, about, 14, 100, species, in, about, 580, genera, which, makes, it, the, fourth, largest, angiosperm, family, rubiaceae, has, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, however, the, largest, species, diversity, is, concentrated, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, economically, important, genera, include, coffea, the, source, of, coffee, cinchona, the, source, of, the, antimalarial, alkaloid, quinine, ornamental, cultivars, e, g, gardenia, ixora, pentas, and, historically, some, dye, plants, e, g, rubia, the, rubiaceae, are, morphologically, easily, recognizable, as, a, coherent, group, by, a, combination, of, characters, opposite, or, whorled, leaves, that, are, simple, and, entire, interpetiolar, stipules, tubular, sympetalous, actinomorphic, corollas, and, an, inferior, ovary, a, wide, variety, of, growth, forms, are, present, shrubs, are, most, common, e, g, coffea, psychotria, but, members, of, the, family, can, also, be, trees, e, g, cinchona, nauclea, lianas, e, g, psychotria, samoritourei, or, herbs, e, g, galium, spermacoce, some, epiphytes, are, also, present, e, g, myrmecodia, the, plants, usually, contain, iridoids, various, alkaloids, and, raphide, crystals, are, common, the, leaves, are, simple, undivided, and, entire, there, is, only, one, case, of, pinnately, compound, leaves, pentagonia, osapinnata, leaf, blades, are, usually, elliptical, with, a, cuneate, base, and, an, acute, tip, in, three, genera, pavetta, psychotria, sericanthe, bacterial, leaf, nodules, can, be, observed, as, dark, spots, or, lines, on, the, leaves, the, phyllotaxis, is, usually, decussate, rarely, whorled, e, g, fadogia, or, rarely, seemingly, alternate, resulting, from, the, reduction, of, one, leaf, at, each, node, e, g, sabicea, sthenula, characteristic, for, the, rubiaceae, is, the, presence, of, stipules, that, are, mostly, fused, to, an, interpetiolar, structure, on, either, side, of, the, stem, between, the, opposite, leaves, their, inside, surface, often, bears, glands, called, colleters, which, produce, mucilaginous, compounds, protecting, the, young, shoot, the, whorled, leaves, of, the, herbaceous, tribe, rubieae, have, classically, been, interpreted, as, true, leaves, plus, interpetiolar, leaf, like, stipules, the, inflorescence, is, a, cyme, rarely, of, solitary, flowers, e, g, rothmannia, and, is, either, terminal, or, axillary, and, paired, at, the, nodes, the, 4, 5, merous, rarely, pleiomerous, e, g, six, in, richardia, flowers, are, usually, bisexual, and, usually, epigynous, the, perianth, is, usually, biseriate, although, the, calyx, is, absent, in, some, taxa, e, g, theligonum, the, calyx, mostly, has, the, lobes, fused, at, the, base, unequal, calyx, lobes, are, not, uncommon, and, sometimes, e, g, mussaenda, one, lobe, is, enlarged, and, coloured, a, so, called, semaphyl, the, corolla, is, sympetalous, mostly, actinomorphic, usually, tubular, mostly, white, or, creamy, but, also, yellow, e, g, gardenia, spp, mycelia, basiflora, and, rarely, blue, e, g, faramea, calyptrata, or, red, e, g, alberta, magna, ixora, coccinea, the, stamens, are, alternipetalous, and, epipetalous, anthers, are, longitudinal, in, dehiscence, but, are, poricidal, in, some, genera, e, g, rustia, tresanthera, the, gynoecium, is, syncarpous, with, an, inferior, ovary, rarely, secondarily, superior, e, g, gaertnera, pagamea, placentation, is, axial, rarely, parietal, e, g, gardenia, ovules, are, anatropous, to, hemitropous, unitegmic, with, a, funicular, obturator, one, to, many, per, carpel, nectaries, are, often, present, as, a, nectariferous, disk, atop, the, ovary, the, fruit, is, a, berry, capsule, e, g, oldenlandia, drupe, e, g, coffea, psychotria, or, schizocarp, e, g, cremocarpon, red, fruits, are, fairly, dominant, e, g, coffea, arabica, yellow, e, g, rosenbergiodendron, formosum, orange, e, g, vangueria, infausta, or, blackish, fruits, e, g, pavetta, gardeniifolia, are, equally, common, blue, fruits, are, rather, exceptional, save, in, the, psychotrieae, and, associated, tribes, most, fruits, are, about, 1, cm, in, diameter, very, small, fruits, are, relatively, rare, and, occur, in, herbaceous, tribes, very, large, fruits, are, rare, and, confined, to, the, gardenieae, the, seeds, are, endospermous, rubiaceae, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, and, are, found, in, nearly, every, region, of, the, world, except, for, extreme, environments, such, as, the, polar, regions, and, deserts, the, distribution, pattern, of, the, family, is, very, similar, to, the, global, distribution, of, plant, diversity, overall, however, the, largest, diversity, is, distinctly, concentrated, in, the, humid, tropics, and, subtropics, an, exception, is, the, tribe, rubieae, which, is, cosmopolitan, but, centered, in, temperate, regions, only, a, few, genera, are, pantropical, e, g, ixora, psychotria, many, are, paleotropical, while, afro, american, distributions, are, rare, e, g, sabicea, endemic, rubiaceous, genera, are, found, in, most, tropical, and, subtropical, floristic, regions, of, the, world, the, highest, number, of, species, is, found, in, colombia, venezuela, and, new, guinea, when, adjusted, for, area, venezuela, is, the, most, diverse, followed, by, colombia, and, cuba, the, rubiaceae, consist, of, terrestrial, and, predominantly, woody, plants, woody, rubiaceous, shrubs, constitute, an, important, part, of, the, understorey, of, low, and, mid, altitude, rainforests, rubiaceae, are, tolerant, of, a, broad, array, of, environmental, conditions, soil, types, altitudes, community, structures, etc, and, do, not, specialize, in, one, specific, habitat, type, although, genera, within, the, family, often, specialize, most, members, of, the, rubiaceae, are, zoophilous, pollinated, mainly, by, insects, entomophilous, species, produce, nectar, from, an, epigynous, disk, at, the, base, of, the, corolla, tube, to, attract, insects, ornithophily, is, rare, and, is, found, in, red, flowered, species, of, alberta, bouvardia, and, burchellia, anemophilous, species, are, found, in, the, tribes, anthospermeae, and, theligoneae, and, are, characterized, by, hermaphroditic, or, unisexual, flowers, that, exhibit, a, set, of, specialized, features, such, as, striking, sexual, dimorphism, increased, receptive, surface, of, the, stigmas, and, pendulous, anthers, although, most, rubiaceae, species, are, hermaphroditic, outbreeding, is, promoted, through, sequential, hermaphroditism, and, spatial, isolation, of, the, reproductive, organs, more, complex, reproductive, strategies, include, secondary, pollen, presentation, heterostyly, and, unisexual, flowers, secondary, pollen, presentation, also, known, as, stylar, pollen, presentation, or, ixoroid, pollen, mechanism, is, especially, known, from, the, gardenieae, and, related, tribes, the, flowers, are, proterandrous, and, the, pollen, is, shed, early, onto, the, outside, of, the, stigmas, or, the, upper, part, of, the, style, which, serve, as, a, pollen, receptacle, increased, surface, area, and, irregularity, of, the, pollen, receptacle, caused, by, swellings, hairs, grooves, or, ridges, often, ensure, a, more, efficient, pollen, deposition, after, elongation, of, the, style, animals, transport, the, pollen, to, flowers, in, the, female, or, receptive, stage, with, exposed, stigmatic, surfaces, a, pollen, catapult, mechanism, is, present, in, the, genera, molopanthera, and, posoqueria, tribe, posoquerieae, that, projects, a, spherical, pollen, mass, onto, visiting, hawk, moths, heterostyly, is, another, mechanism, to, avoid, inbreeding, and, is, widely, present, in, the, family, rubiaceae, the, tribes, containing, the, largest, number, of, heterostylous, species, are, spermacoceae, and, psychotrieae, heterostyly, is, absent, in, groups, that, have, secondary, pollen, presentation, e, g, vanguerieae, unisexual, flowers, also, occur, in, rubiaceae, and, most, taxa, that, have, this, characteristic, are, dioecious, the, two, flower, morphs, are, however, difficult, to, observe, as, they, are, rather, morphologically, similar, male, flowers, have, a, rudimentary, pistil, with, the, ovaries, empty, and, female, flowers, sterile, or, rudimentary, stamens, with, empty, anthers, flowers, that, are, morphologically, hermaphrodite, but, functionally, dioecious, occur, in, pyrostria, the, dispersal, units, in, rubiaceae, can, be, entire, fruits, syncarps, mericarps, pyrenes, or, seeds, fleshy, fruit, taxa, are, probably, all, endo, zoochorous, e, g, tribes, pavetteae, psychotrieae, while, the, dispersal, of, dry, fruits, is, often, unspecialized, e, g, tribes, knoxieae, spermacoceae, when, seeds, function, as, diaspores, the, dispersal, is, either, anemochorous, or, hydrochorous, the, three, types, of, wind, dispersed, diaspores, in, rubiaceae, are, dust, seeds, rare, e, g, lerchea, plumed, seeds, e, g, hillia, and, winged, seeds, e, g, coutarea, long, distance, dispersal, by, ocean, currents, is, very, rare, e, g, the, seashore, tree, guettarda, speciosa, other, dispersal, mechanisms, are, absent, or, at, least, very, rare, some, spermacoceae, having, seeds, with, elaiosomes, are, probably, myrmecochorous, e, g, spermacoce, hepperiana, epizoochorous, taxa, are, limited, to, herbaceous, rubiaceae, e, g, galium, aparine, fruits, are, densely, covered, with, hooked, bristly, hairs, the, genera, anthorrhiza, hydnophytum, myrmecodia, myrmephytum, and, squamellaria, are, succulent, epiphytes, that, have, evolved, a, mutualistic, relationship, with, ants, their, hypocotyl, grows, out, into, an, ant, inhabited, tuber, some, shrubs, or, trees, have, ant, holes, in, their, stems, e, g, globulostylis, some, rubiaceae, species, have, domatia, that, are, inhabited, by, mites, viz, acarodomatia, e, g, plectroniella, armata, an, intimate, association, between, bacteria, and, plants, is, found, in, three, rubiaceous, genera, viz, pavetta, psychotria, and, sericanthe, the, presence, of, endophytic, bacteria, is, visible, by, eye, because, of, the, formation, of, dark, spots, or, nodules, in, the, leaf, blades, the, endophytes, have, been, identified, as, burkholderia, bacteria, a, second, type, of, bacterial, leaf, symbiosis, is, found, in, the, genera, fadogia, fadogiella, globulostylis, rytigynia, and, vangueria, all, belonging, to, the, tribe, vanguerieae, and, in, some, species, of, empogona, and, tricalysia, both, belonging, to, the, tribe, coffeeae, where, burkholderia, bacteria, are, found, freely, distributed, among, the, mesophyll, cells, and, no, leaf, nodules, are, formed, the, hypothesis, regarding, the, function, of, the, symbiosis, is, that, the, endophytes, provide, chemical, protection, against, herbivory, by, producing, certain, toxic, secondary, metabolites, the, family, rubiaceae, is, named, after, rubia, a, name, used, by, pliny, the, elder, in, his, naturalis, historia, for, madder, rubia, tinctorum, the, roots, of, this, plant, have, been, used, since, ancient, times, to, extract, alizarin, and, purpurin, two, red, dyes, used, for, coloring, clothes, the, name, rubia, is, therefore, derived, from, the, latin, word, ruber, meaning, red, the, well, known, genus, rubus, blackberries, and, raspberries, is, unrelated, and, belongs, to, rosaceae, the, rose, family, the, name, rubiaceae, nomen, conservandum, was, published, in, 1789, by, antoine, laurent, de, jussieu, but, the, name, was, already, mentioned, in, 1782, several, historically, accepted, families, are, included, in, rubiaceae, aparinaceae, asperulaceae, catesbaeaceae, cephalanthaceae, cinchonaceae, coffeaceae, coutariaceae, dialypetalanthaceae, galiaceae, gardeniaceae, guettardaceae, hameliaceae, hedyotidaceae, henriqueziaceae, houstoniaceae, hydrophylacaceae, lippayaceae, lygodisodeaceae, naucleaceae, nonateliaceae, operculariaceae, pagamaeaceae, psychotriaceae, randiaceae, sabiceaceae, spermacoceaceae, theligonaceae, the, classical, classification, system, of, rubiaceae, distinguished, only, two, subfamilies, cinchonoideae, characterized, by, more, than, one, ovule, in, each, locule, and, coffeoideae, having, one, ovule, in, each, locule, this, distinction, however, was, criticized, because, of, the, distant, position, of, two, obviously, related, tribes, viz, gardenieae, with, many, ovules, in, cinchonoideae, and, ixoreae, with, one, ovule, in, coffeoideae, and, because, in, species, of, tarenna, the, number, of, ovules, varies, from, one, to, several, in, each, locule, during, the, 20th, century, other, morphological, characters, were, used, to, delineate, subfamilies, e, g, stylar, pollen, presentation, raphides, endosperm, heterostyly, etc, on, this, basis, three, or, eight, subfamilies, were, recognised, the, last, subfamilial, classification, solely, based, on, morphological, characters, divided, rubiaceae, into, four, subfamilies, cinchonoideae, ixoroideae, antirheoideae, and, rubioideae, in, general, problems, of, subfamilies, delimitation, in, rubiaceae, based, on, morphological, characters, are, linked, with, the, extreme, naturalness, of, the, family, hence, a, relatively, low, divergence, of, its, members, the, introduction, of, molecular, phylogenetics, in, rubiaceae, research, has, corroborated, or, rejected, several, of, the, conclusions, made, in, the, pre, molecular, era, there, was, support, for, the, subfamilies, cinchonoideae, ixoroideae, and, rubioideae, although, differently, circumscribed, and, antirheoideae, was, shown, to, be, polyphyletic, for, a, long, time, the, classification, with, three, subfamilies, cinchonoideae, ixoroideae, and, rubioideae, was, followed, however, an, alternative, opinion, existed, with, only, two, subfamilies, an, expanded, cinchonoideae, that, includes, ixoroideae, coptosapelteae, and, luculieae, and, rubioideae, finally, more, and, more, evidence, pointed, towards, a, two, family, classification, the, adoption, of, the, melbourne, code, for, botanical, nomenclature, had, an, unexpected, impact, on, many, names, that, have, been, long, in, use, and, are, well, established, in, literature, according, to, the, melbourne, code, the, subfamilial, name, ixoroideae, had, to, be, replaced, by, dialypetalanthoideae, this, means, that, the, two, subfamilies, in, rubiaceae, now, are, dialypetalanthoideae, and, rubioideae, the, monogeneric, tribes, coptosapelteae, acranthereae, and, luculieae, are, not, placed, within, a, subfamily, and, are, sister, to, the, rest, of, rubiaceae, the, following, overview, shows, the, latest, classification, of, the, family, with, two, subfamilies, and, 71, tribes, the, approximate, number, of, species, and, genera, are, indicated, between, brackets, species, genera, the, family, rubiaceae, contains, about, 14, 100, species, in, 580, genera, this, makes, it, the, fourth, largest, family, of, flowering, plants, by, number, of, species, and, fifth, largest, by, number, of, genera, although, taxonomic, adjustments, are, still, being, made, the, total, number, of, accepted, genera, remains, stable, in, total, around, 1338, genus, names, have, been, published, indicating, that, more, than, half, of, the, published, names, are, synonyms, psychotria, with, around, 1630, species, is, the, largest, genus, within, the, family, and, the, third, largest, genus, of, the, angiosperms, after, the, legume, astragalus, and, the, orchid, bulbophyllum, however, the, delimitation, of, psychotria, remains, problematic, and, its, adjustment, might, reduce, the, number, of, species, in, total, 30, genera, have, more, than, 100, species, however, 197, genera, are, monotypic, which, account, for, a, third, of, all, genera, but, only, for, 1, 4, of, all, species, molecular, studies, have, demonstrated, the, phylogenetic, placement, of, rubiaceae, within, the, order, gentianales, and, the, monophyly, of, the, family, is, confirmed, the, relationships, of, the, two, subfamilies, of, rubiaceae, together, with, the, tribes, acranthereae, coptosapelteae, and, luculieae, are, shown, in, the, phylogenetic, tree, below, the, placement, of, these, three, tribes, relative, to, the, two, subfamilies, has, not, been, fully, resolved, luculieae, acranthereae, coptosapelteae, rubioideae, dialypetalanthoideae, the, fossil, history, of, the, rubiaceae, goes, back, at, least, as, far, as, the, eocene, the, geographic, distribution, of, these, fossils, coupled, with, the, fact, that, they, represent, all, three, subfamilies, is, indicative, of, an, earlier, origin, for, the, family, probably, in, the, late, cretaceous, or, paleocene, although, fossils, dating, back, to, the, cretaceous, and, palaeocene, have, been, referred, to, the, family, by, various, authors, none, of, these, fossils, has, been, confirmed, as, belonging, to, the, rubiaceae, the, oldest, confirmed, fossils, which, are, fruits, that, strongly, resemble, those, of, the, genus, emmenopterys, were, found, in, the, washington, and, are, 48, 49, million, years, old, a, fossil, infructescence, and, fruit, found, in, 44, million, year, old, strata, in, oregon, was, assigned, to, emmenopterys, dilcheri, an, extinct, species, the, next, oldest, fossils, date, to, the, late, eocene, and, include, canthium, from, australia, faramea, from, panama, guettarda, from, new, caledonia, and, paleorubiaceophyllum, an, extinct, genus, from, the, southeastern, united, states, fossil, rubiaceae, are, known, from, three, regions, in, the, eocene, north, america, north, of, mexico, mexico, central, america, caribbean, and, southeast, pacific, asia, in, the, oligocene, they, are, found, in, these, three, regions, plus, africa, in, the, miocene, they, are, found, in, these, four, regions, plus, south, america, and, europe, no, staple, foods, are, found, in, the, rubiaceae, but, some, species, are, consumed, locally, and, fruits, may, be, used, as, famine, food, examples, are, african, medlar, fruits, e, g, v, infausta, v, madagascariensis, african, peach, nauclea, latifolia, and, noni, morinda, citrifolia, the, most, economically, important, member, of, the, family, is, the, genus, coffea, used, in, the, production, of, coffee, coffea, includes, 124, species, but, only, three, species, are, cultivated, for, coffee, production, c, arabica, c, canephora, and, c, liberica, the, bark, of, trees, in, the, genus, cinchona, is, the, source, of, a, variety, of, alkaloids, the, most, familiar, of, which, is, quinine, one, of, the, first, agents, effective, in, treating, malaria, woodruff, galium, odoratum, is, a, small, herbaceous, perennial, that, contains, coumarin, a,

dimethyltryptamine, in, the, preparation, of, ayahuasca, a, psychoactive, decoction, the, bark, of, the, species, breonadia, salicina, have, been, used, in, traditional, african, medicine, for, many, years, the, leaves, of, the, kratom, plant, mitragyna, speciosa, contain, a, variety, of, alkaloids, including, several, psychoactive, alkaloids, and, is, traditionally, prepared, and, consumed, in, southeast, asia, where, it, has, been, known, to, exhibit, both, painkilling, and, stimulant, qualities, behaving, as, a, opioid, receptor, agonist, and, often, being, used, in, traditional, thai, medicine, in, a, similar, way, to, and, often, as, a, replacement, for, opioid, painkillers, like, morphine, originally, from, china, the, common, gardenia, gardenia, jasminoides, is, a, widely, grown, garden, plant, and, flower, in, frost, free, climates, worldwide, several, other, species, from, the, genus, are, also, seen, in, horticulture, the, genus, ixora, contains, plants, cultivated, in, warmer, climate, gardens, the, most, commonly, grown, species, ixora, coccinea, is, frequently, used, for, pretty, red, flowering, hedges, mussaenda, cultivars, with, enlarged, colored, calyx,
