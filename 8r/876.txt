squirrels, are, members, of, the, family, sciuridae, s, j, u, r, d, e, d, i, a, family, that, includes, small, or, medium, sized, rodents, the, squirrel, family, includes, tree, squirrels, ground, squirrels, including, chipmunks, and, prairie, dogs, among, others, and, flying, squirrels, squirrels, are, indigenous, to, the, americas, eurasia, and, africa, and, were, introduced, by, humans, to, australia, the, earliest, known, fossilized, squirrels, date, from, the, eocene, epoch, and, among, other, living, rodent, families, the, squirrels, are, most, closely, related, to, the, mountain, beaver, and, dormice, the, word, squirrel, first, attested, in, 1327, comes, from, the, anglo, norman, esquirel, which, is, from, the, old, french, escurel, the, reflex, of, a, latin, word, sciurus, which, was, taken, from, the, ancient, greek, word, skiouros, from, shadow, tailed, referring, to, the, long, bushy, tail, which, many, of, its, members, have, sciurus, is, also, the, name, of, one, of, its, genuses, the, native, old, english, word, for, the, squirrel, cweorna, only, survived, into, middle, english, as, aquerne, before, being, replaced, the, old, english, word, is, of, common, germanic, origin, cognates, of, which, are, still, used, in, other, germanic, languages, including, the, german, eichh, rnchen, diminutive, of, eichhorn, which, is, not, as, frequently, used, the, norwegian, ikorn, ekorn, the, dutch, eekhoorn, the, swedish, ekorre, and, the, danish, egern, a, group, of, squirrels, is, called, a, dray, or, a, scurry, squirrels, are, generally, small, animals, ranging, in, size, from, the, african, pygmy, squirrel, and, least, pygmy, squirrel, at, 10, 14, cm, 3, 9, 5, 5, in, in, total, length, and, just, 12, 26, g, 0, 42, 0, 92, oz, in, weight, to, the, bhutan, giant, flying, squirrel, at, up, to, 1, 27, m, 4, ft, 2, in, in, total, length, and, several, marmot, species, which, can, weigh, 8, kg, 18, lb, or, more, squirrels, typically, have, slender, bodies, with, very, long, very, bushy, tails, and, large, eyes, in, general, their, fur, is, soft, and, silky, though, much, thicker, in, some, species, than, others, the, coat, color, of, squirrels, is, highly, variable, between, and, often, even, within, species, in, most, squirrel, species, the, hind, limbs, are, longer, than, the, forelimbs, while, all, species, have, either, four, or, five, toes, on, each, foot, the, feet, which, include, an, often, poorly, developed, thumb, have, soft, pads, on, the, undersides, and, versatile, sturdy, claws, for, grasping, and, climbing, tree, squirrels, unlike, most, mammals, can, descend, a, tree, headfirst, they, do, so, by, rotating, their, ankles, 180, degrees, enabling, the, hind, feet, to, point, backward, and, thus, grip, the, tree, bark, from, the, opposite, direction, as, their, large, eyes, indicate, squirrels, have, excellent, vision, which, is, especially, important, for, the, tree, dwelling, species, many, also, have, a, good, sense, of, touch, with, vibrissae, on, their, limbs, as, well, as, their, heads, the, teeth, of, sciurids, follow, the, typical, rodent, pattern, with, large, incisors, for, gnawing, that, grow, throughout, life, and, cheek, teeth, for, grinding, that, are, set, back, behind, a, wide, gap, or, diastema, the, typical, dental, formula, for, sciurids, is, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 3, the, purposes, of, squirrels, tails, to, benefit, the, squirrel, include, the, hairs, from, squirrel, tails, are, prized, in, fly, fishing, when, tying, fishing, flies, squirrel, hair, is, very, fine, making, it, better, for, tying, fishing, flies, when, the, squirrel, sits, upright, its, tail, folded, up, its, back, may, stop, predators, looking, from, behind, from, seeing, the, characteristic, shape, of, a, small, mammal, squirrels, live, in, almost, every, habitat, from, tropical, rainforest, to, semiarid, desert, avoiding, only, the, high, polar, regions, and, the, driest, of, deserts, they, are, predominantly, herbivorous, subsisting, on, seeds, and, nuts, but, many, will, eat, insects, and, even, small, vertebrates, many, juvenile, squirrels, die, in, the, first, year, of, life, adult, squirrels, can, have, a, lifespan, of, 5, to, 10, years, in, the, wild, some, can, survive, 10, to, 20, years, in, captivity, premature, death, may, occur, when, a, nest, falls, from, the, tree, in, which, case, the, mother, may, abandon, her, young, if, their, body, temperature, is, not, correct, many, such, baby, squirrels, have, been, rescued, and, fostered, by, a, professional, wildlife, rehabilitator, until, they, could, be, safely, returned, to, the, wild, although, the, density, of, squirrel, populations, in, many, places, and, the, constant, care, required, by, premature, squirrels, means, that, few, rehabilitators, are, willing, to, spend, their, time, doing, this, and, such, animals, are, routinely, euthanized, instead, squirrels, mate, either, once, or, twice, a, year, and, following, a, gestation, period, of, three, to, six, weeks, give, birth, to, a, number, of, offspring, that, varies, by, species, the, young, are, altricial, being, born, naked, toothless, and, blind, in, most, species, of, squirrel, the, female, alone, looks, after, the, young, which, are, weaned, at, six, to, ten, weeks, and, become, sexually, mature, by, the, end, of, their, first, year, in, general, the, ground, dwelling, squirrel, species, are, social, often, living, in, well, developed, colonies, while, the, tree, dwelling, species, are, more, solitary, ground, squirrels, and, tree, squirrels, are, usually, either, diurnal, or, crepuscular, while, the, flying, squirrels, tend, to, be, nocturnal, except, for, lactating, flying, squirrels, and, their, young, which, have, a, period, of, diurnality, during, the, summer, during, hot, periods, squirrels, have, been, documented, to, sploot, or, lay, their, stomachs, down, on, cool, surfaces, squirrels, like, other, rodents, employ, species, specific, strategies, to, store, food, buffering, against, periods, of, scarcity, in, temperate, regions, squirrels, commonly, cache, nuts, beneath, leaf, litter, inside, hollow, trees, or, underground, however, in, subtropical, and, humid, environments, traditional, caching, can, lead, to, mold, growth, decomposition, or, premature, germination, to, counteract, these, challenges, some, squirrels, particularly, in, subtropical, zones, hang, nuts, or, mushrooms, on, tree, branches, this, behavior, believed, to, minimize, fungal, infections, and, reduce, the, risk, of, food, loss, also, inadvertently, aids, certain, trees, like, cyclobalanopsis, in, expanding, their, range, with, forgotten, or, dislodged, nuts, sprouting, in, new, locations, influencing, forest, ecology, two, species, of, flying, squrrirel, the, particolored, flying, squirrel, and, hainan, flying, squirrel, aid, such, cacheing, by, carving, grooves, into, the, nuts, to, fix, the, nuts, tightly, between, small, intersecting, twigs, akin, to, the, mortise, tenon, joint, in, carpentry, because, squirrels, cannot, digest, cellulose, they, must, rely, on, foods, rich, in, protein, carbohydrates, and, fats, in, temperate, regions, early, spring, is, the, hardest, time, of, year, for, squirrels, because, the, nuts, they, buried, are, beginning, to, sprout, and, thus, are, no, longer, available, to, eat, while, many, of, the, usual, food, sources, are, not, yet, available, during, these, times, squirrels, rely, heavily, on, tree, buds, squirrels, being, primarily, herbivores, eat, a, wide, variety, of, plants, as, well, as, nuts, seeds, conifer, cones, fruits, fungi, and, green, vegetation, some, squirrels, however, also, consume, meat, especially, when, faced, with, hunger, squirrels, have, been, known, to, eat, small, birds, young, snakes, and, smaller, rodents, as, well, as, bird, eggs, and, insects, some, tropical, squirrel, species, have, shifted, almost, entirely, to, a, diet, of, insects, squirrels, like, pigeons, and, other, fauna, are, synanthropes, in, that, they, benefit, and, thrive, from, their, interaction, in, human, environments, this, gradual, process, of, successful, interaction, is, called, synurbanization, wherein, squirrels, lose, their, inherent, fear, of, humans, in, an, urban, environment, when, squirrels, were, almost, completely, eradicated, during, the, industrial, revolution, in, new, york, they, were, later, re, introduced, to, entertain, and, remind, humans, of, nature, the, squirrel, blended, into, the, urban, environment, so, efficiently, that, when, synanthropic, behavior, stops, i, e, people, do, not, leave, trash, outside, during, particularly, cold, winters, they, can, become, aggressive, in, their, search, for, food, aggression, and, predatory, behavior, has, been, observed, in, various, species, of, ground, squirrels, in, particular, the, thirteen, lined, ground, squirrel, for, example, bernard, bailey, a, scientist, in, the, 1920s, observed, a, thirteen, lined, ground, squirrel, preying, upon, a, young, chicken, wistrand, reported, seeing, this, same, species, eating, a, freshly, killed, snake, there, has, also, been, at, least, one, report, of, squirrels, preying, on, atypical, animals, such, as, an, incident, in, 2005, where, a, pack, of, black, squirrels, killed, and, ate, a, large, stray, dog, in, lazo, russia, squirrel, attacks, on, humans, are, exceedingly, rare, but, do, occur, whitaker, examined, the, stomachs, of, 139, thirteen, lined, ground, squirrels, and, found, bird, flesh, in, four, of, the, specimens, and, the, remains, of, a, short, tailed, shrew, in, one, bradley, examining, the, stomachs, of, white, tailed, antelope, squirrels, found, at, least, 10, of, his, 609, specimens, stomachs, contained, some, type, of, vertebrate, mostly, lizards, and, rodents, morgart, observed, a, white, tailed, antelope, squirrel, capturing, and, eating, a, silky, pocket, mouse, the, living, squirrels, are, divided, into, five, subfamilies, with, about, 58, genera, and, some, 285, species, the, oldest, squirrel, fossil, hesperopetes, dates, back, to, the, chadronian, late, eocene, about, 40, 35, million, years, ago, and, is, similar, to, modern, flying, squirrels, a, variety, of, fossil, squirrels, from, the, latest, eocene, to, the, miocene, have, not, been, assigned, with, certainty, to, any, living, lineage, at, least, some, of, these, probably, were, variants, of, the, oldest, basal, protosquirrels, in, the, sense, that, they, lacked, the, full, range, of, living, squirrels, autapomorphies, the, distribution, and, diversity, of, such, ancient, and, ancestral, forms, suggest, the, squirrels, as, a, group, may, have, originated, in, north, america, apart, from, these, sometimes, little, known, fossil, forms, the, phylogeny, of, the, living, squirrels, is, fairly, straightforward, the, three, main, lineages, are, the, ratufinae, oriental, giant, squirrels, sciurillinae, and, all, other, subfamilies, the, ratufinae, contain, a, mere, handful, of, living, species, in, tropical, asia, the, neotropical, pygmy, squirrel, of, tropical, south, america, is, the, sole, living, member, of, the, sciurillinae, the, third, lineage, by, far, the, largest, has, a, near, cosmopolitan, distribution, this, further, supports, the, hypothesis, that, the, common, ancestor, of, all, squirrels, living, and, fossil, lived, in, north, america, as, these, three, most, ancient, lineages, seem, to, have, radiated, from, there, if, squirrels, had, originated, in, eurasia, for, example, one, would, expect, quite, ancient, lineages, in, africa, but, african, squirrels, seem, to, be, of, more, recent, origin, the, main, group, of, squirrels, can, be, split, into, five, subfamilies, the, callosciurinae, 60, species, mostly, found, in, south, east, asia, the, ratufinae, 4, cat, sized, species, found, in, south, and, southeast, asia, the, sciurinae, which, contains, the, flying, squirrels, pteromyini, and, the, tree, squirrels, 83, species, found, worldwide, sciurillinae, a, single, south, american, species, and, xerinae, which, includes, three, tribes, of, mostly, terrestrial, squirrels, including, the, marmotini, marmots, chipmunks, prairie, dogs, and, other, holarctic, ground, squirrels, xerini, african, and, some, eurasian, ground, squirrels, and, protoxerini, african, tree, squirrels
