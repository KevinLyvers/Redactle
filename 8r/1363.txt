hepatitis, is, inflammation, of, the, liver, tissue, some, people, or, animals, with, hepatitis, have, no, symptoms, whereas, others, develop, yellow, discoloration, of, the, skin, and, whites, of, the, eyes, jaundice, poor, appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal, pain, and, diarrhea, hepatitis, is, acute, if, it, resolves, within, six, months, and, chronic, if, it, lasts, longer, than, six, months, acute, hepatitis, can, resolve, on, its, own, progress, to, chronic, hepatitis, or, rarely, result, in, acute, liver, failure, chronic, hepatitis, may, progress, to, scarring, of, the, liver, cirrhosis, liver, failure, and, liver, cancer, hepatitis, is, most, commonly, caused, by, the, virus, hepatovirus, a, b, c, d, and, e, other, viruses, can, also, cause, liver, inflammation, including, cytomegalovirus, epstein, barr, virus, and, yellow, fever, virus, other, common, causes, of, hepatitis, include, heavy, alcohol, use, certain, medications, toxins, other, infections, autoimmune, diseases, and, non, alcoholic, steatohepatitis, nash, hepatitis, a, and, e, are, mainly, spread, by, contaminated, food, and, water, hepatitis, b, is, mainly, sexually, transmitted, but, may, also, be, passed, from, mother, to, baby, during, pregnancy, or, childbirth, and, spread, through, infected, blood, hepatitis, c, is, commonly, spread, through, infected, blood, such, as, may, occur, during, needle, sharing, by, intravenous, drug, users, hepatitis, d, can, only, infect, people, already, infected, with, hepatitis, b, hepatitis, a, b, and, d, are, preventable, with, immunization, medications, may, be, used, to, treat, chronic, viral, hepatitis, antiviral, medications, are, recommended, in, all, with, chronic, hepatitis, c, except, those, with, conditions, that, limit, their, life, expectancy, there, is, no, specific, treatment, for, nash, physical, activity, a, healthy, diet, and, weight, loss, are, recommended, autoimmune, hepatitis, may, be, treated, with, medications, to, suppress, the, immune, system, a, liver, transplant, may, be, an, option, in, both, acute, and, chronic, liver, failure, worldwide, in, 2015, hepatitis, a, occurred, in, about, 114, million, people, chronic, hepatitis, b, affected, about, 343, million, people, and, chronic, hepatitis, c, about, 142, million, people, in, the, united, states, nash, affects, about, 11, million, people, and, alcoholic, hepatitis, affects, about, 5, million, people, hepatitis, results, in, more, than, a, million, deaths, a, year, most, of, which, occur, indirectly, from, liver, scarring, or, liver, cancer, in, the, united, states, hepatitis, a, is, estimated, to, occur, in, about, 2, 500, people, a, year, and, results, in, about, 75, deaths, the, word, is, derived, from, the, greek, h, par, meaning, liver, and, itis, meaning, inflammation, hepatitis, has, a, broad, spectrum, of, presentations, that, range, from, a, complete, lack, of, symptoms, to, severe, liver, failure, the, acute, form, of, hepatitis, generally, caused, by, viral, infection, is, characterized, by, constitutional, symptoms, that, are, typically, self, limiting, chronic, hepatitis, presents, similarly, but, can, manifest, signs, and, symptoms, specific, to, liver, dysfunction, with, long, standing, inflammation, and, damage, to, the, organ, acute, viral, hepatitis, follows, three, distinct, phases, both, drug, induced, hepatitis, and, autoimmune, hepatitis, can, present, very, similarly, to, acute, viral, hepatitis, with, slight, variations, in, symptoms, depending, on, the, cause, cases, of, drug, induced, hepatitis, can, manifest, with, systemic, signs, of, an, allergic, reaction, including, rash, fever, serositis, inflammation, of, membranes, lining, certain, organs, elevated, eosinophils, a, type, of, white, blood, cell, and, suppression, of, bone, marrow, activity, fulminant, hepatitis, or, massive, hepatic, cell, death, is, a, rare, and, life, threatening, complication, of, acute, hepatitis, that, can, occur, in, cases, of, hepatitis, b, d, and, e, in, addition, to, drug, induced, and, autoimmune, hepatitis, the, complication, more, frequently, occurs, in, instances, of, hepatitis, b, and, d, co, infection, at, a, rate, of, 2, 20, and, in, pregnant, women, with, hepatitis, e, at, rate, of, 15, 20, of, cases, in, addition, to, the, signs, of, acute, hepatitis, people, can, also, demonstrate, signs, of, coagulopathy, abnormal, coagulation, studies, with, easy, bruising, and, bleeding, and, encephalopathy, confusion, disorientation, and, sleepiness, mortality, due, to, fulminant, hepatitis, is, typically, the, result, of, various, complications, including, cerebral, edema, gastrointestinal, bleeding, sepsis, respiratory, failure, or, kidney, failure, acute, cases, of, hepatitis, are, seen, to, be, resolved, well, within, a, six, month, period, when, hepatitis, is, continued, for, more, than, six, months, it, is, termed, chronic, hepatitis, chronic, hepatitis, is, often, asymptomatic, early, in, its, course, and, is, detected, only, by, liver, laboratory, studies, for, screening, purposes, or, to, evaluate, non, specific, symptoms, as, the, inflammation, progresses, patients, can, develop, constitutional, symptoms, similar, to, acute, hepatitis, including, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, poor, appetite, and, joint, pain, jaundice, can, occur, as, well, but, much, later, in, the, disease, process, and, is, typically, a, sign, of, advanced, disease, chronic, hepatitis, interferes, with, hormonal, functions, of, the, liver, which, can, result, in, acne, hirsutism, abnormal, hair, growth, and, amenorrhea, lack, of, menstrual, period, in, women, extensive, damage, and, scarring, of, the, liver, over, time, defines, cirrhosis, a, condition, in, which, the, liver, s, ability, to, function, is, permanently, impeded, this, results, in, jaundice, weight, loss, coagulopathy, ascites, abdominal, fluid, collection, and, peripheral, edema, leg, swelling, cirrhosis, can, lead, to, other, life, threatening, complications, such, as, hepatic, encephalopathy, esophageal, varices, hepatorenal, syndrome, and, liver, cancer, causes, of, hepatitis, can, be, divided, into, the, following, major, categories, infectious, metabolic, ischemic, autoimmune, genetic, and, other, infectious, agents, include, viruses, bacteria, and, parasites, metabolic, causes, include, prescription, medications, toxins, most, notably, alcohol, and, non, alcoholic, fatty, liver, disease, autoimmune, and, genetic, causes, of, hepatitis, involve, genetic, predispositions, and, tend, to, affect, characteristic, populations, viral, hepatitis, is, the, most, common, type, of, hepatitis, worldwide, especially, in, asia, and, africa, viral, hepatitis, is, caused, by, five, different, viruses, hepatitis, a, b, c, d, and, e, hepatitis, a, and, hepatitis, e, behave, similarly, they, are, both, transmitted, by, the, fecal, oral, route, are, more, common, in, developing, countries, and, are, self, limiting, illnesses, that, do, not, lead, to, chronic, hepatitis, hepatitis, b, hepatitis, c, and, hepatitis, d, are, transmitted, when, blood, or, mucous, membranes, are, exposed, to, infected, blood, and, body, fluids, such, as, semen, and, vaginal, secretions, viral, particles, have, also, been, found, in, saliva, and, breastmilk, kissing, sharing, utensils, and, breastfeeding, do, not, lead, to, transmission, unless, these, fluids, are, introduced, into, open, sores, or, cuts, many, families, who, do, not, have, safe, drinking, water, or, live, in, unhygienic, homes, have, contracted, hepatitis, because, saliva, and, blood, droplets, are, often, carried, through, the, water, and, blood, borne, illnesses, spread, quickly, in, unsanitary, settings, hepatitis, b, and, c, can, present, either, acutely, or, chronically, hepatitis, d, is, a, defective, virus, that, requires, hepatitis, b, to, replicate, and, is, only, found, with, hepatitis, b, co, infection, in, adults, hepatitis, b, infection, is, most, commonly, self, limiting, with, less, than, 5, progressing, to, chronic, state, and, 20, to, 30, of, those, chronically, infected, developing, cirrhosis, or, liver, cancer, infection, in, infants, and, children, frequently, leads, to, chronic, infection, unlike, hepatitis, b, most, cases, of, hepatitis, c, lead, to, chronic, infection, hepatitis, c, is, the, second, most, common, cause, of, cirrhosis, in, the, us, second, to, alcoholic, hepatitis, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, blood, transfusions, were, a, major, factor, in, spreading, hepatitis, c, virus, since, widespread, screening, of, blood, products, for, hepatitis, c, began, in, 1992, the, risk, of, acquiring, hepatitis, c, from, a, blood, transfusion, has, decreased, from, approximately, 10, in, the, 1970s, to, 1, in, 2, million, currently, parasites, can, also, infect, the, liver, and, activate, the, immune, response, resulting, in, symptoms, of, acute, hepatitis, with, increased, serum, ige, though, chronic, hepatitis, is, possible, with, chronic, infections, of, the, protozoans, trypanosoma, cruzi, leishmania, species, and, the, malaria, causing, plasmodium, species, all, can, cause, liver, inflammation, another, protozoan, entamoeba, histolytica, causes, hepatitis, with, distinct, liver, abscesses, of, the, worms, the, cestode, echinococcus, granulosus, also, known, as, the, dog, tapeworm, infects, the, liver, and, forms, characteristic, hepatic, hydatid, cysts, the, liver, flukes, fasciola, hepatica, and, clonorchis, sinensis, live, in, the, bile, ducts, and, cause, progressive, hepatitis, and, liver, fibrosis, bacterial, infection, of, the, liver, commonly, results, in, pyogenic, liver, abscesses, acute, hepatitis, or, granulomatous, or, chronic, liver, disease, pyogenic, abscesses, commonly, involve, enteric, bacteria, such, as, escherichia, coli, and, klebsiella, pneumoniae, and, are, composed, of, multiple, bacteria, up, to, 50, of, the, time, acute, hepatitis, is, caused, by, neisseria, meningitidis, neisseria, gonorrhoeae, bartonella, henselae, borrelia, burgdorferi, salmonella, species, brucella, species, and, campylobacter, species, chronic, or, granulomatous, hepatitis, is, seen, with, infection, from, mycobacteria, species, tropheryma, whipplei, treponema, pallidum, coxiella, burnetii, and, rickettsia, species, excessive, alcohol, consumption, is, a, significant, cause, of, hepatitis, and, is, the, most, common, cause, of, cirrhosis, in, the, u, s, alcoholic, hepatitis, is, within, the, spectrum, of, alcoholic, liver, disease, this, ranges, in, order, of, severity, and, reversibility, from, alcoholic, steatosis, least, severe, most, reversible, alcoholic, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and, liver, cancer, most, severe, least, reversible, hepatitis, usually, develops, over, years, long, exposure, to, alcohol, occurring, in, 10, to, 20, of, alcoholics, the, most, important, risk, factors, for, the, development, of, alcoholic, hepatitis, are, quantity, and, duration, of, alcohol, intake, long, term, alcohol, intake, in, excess, of, 80, grams, of, alcohol, a, day, in, men, and, 40, grams, a, day, in, women, is, associated, with, development, of, alcoholic, hepatitis, 1, beer, or, 4, ounces, of, wine, is, equivalent, to, 12g, of, alcohol, alcoholic, hepatitis, can, vary, from, asymptomatic, hepatomegaly, enlarged, liver, to, symptoms, of, acute, or, chronic, hepatitis, to, liver, failure, many, chemical, agents, including, medications, industrial, toxins, and, herbal, and, dietary, supplements, can, cause, hepatitis, the, spectrum, of, drug, induced, liver, injury, varies, from, acute, hepatitis, to, chronic, hepatitis, to, acute, liver, failure, toxins, and, medications, can, cause, liver, injury, through, a, variety, of, mechanisms, including, direct, cell, damage, disruption, of, cell, metabolism, and, causing, structural, changes, some, drugs, such, as, paracetamol, exhibit, predictable, dose, dependent, liver, damage, while, others, such, as, isoniazid, cause, idiosyncratic, and, unpredictable, reactions, that, vary, by, person, there, are, wide, variations, in, the, mechanisms, of, liver, injury, and, latency, period, from, exposure, to, development, of, clinical, illness, many, types, of, drugs, can, cause, liver, injury, including, the, analgesic, paracetamol, antibiotics, such, as, isoniazid, nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin, clavulanate, erythromycin, and, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, anticonvulsants, such, as, valproate, and, phenytoin, cholesterol, lowering, statins, steroids, such, as, oral, contraceptives, and, anabolic, steroids, and, highly, active, anti, retroviral, therapy, used, in, the, treatment, of, hiv, aids, of, these, amoxicillin, clavulanate, is, the, most, common, cause, of, drug, induced, liver, injury, and, paracetamol, toxicity, the, most, common, cause, of, acute, liver, failure, in, the, united, states, and, europe, herbal, remedies, and, dietary, supplements, are, another, important, cause, of, hepatitis, these, are, the, most, common, causes, of, drug, induced, hepatitis, in, korea, the, united, states, based, drug, induced, liver, injury, network, linked, more, than, 16, of, cases, of, hepatotoxicity, to, herbal, and, dietary, supplements, in, the, united, states, herbal, and, dietary, supplements, unlike, pharmaceutical, drugs, are, unregulated, by, the, food, and, drug, administration, the, national, institutes, of, health, maintains, the, livertox, archived, 2019, 07, 24, at, the, wayback, machine, database, for, consumers, to, track, all, known, prescription, and, non, prescription, compounds, associated, with, liver, injury, exposure, to, other, hepatotoxins, can, occur, accidentally, or, intentionally, through, ingestion, inhalation, and, skin, absorption, the, industrial, toxin, carbon, tetrachloride, and, the, wild, mushroom, amanita, phalloides, are, other, known, hepatotoxins, non, alcoholic, hepatitis, is, within, the, spectrum, of, non, alcoholic, liver, disease, nald, which, ranges, in, severity, and, reversibility, from, non, alcoholic, fatty, liver, disease, nafld, to, non, alcoholic, steatohepatitis, nash, to, cirrhosis, to, liver, cancer, similar, to, the, spectrum, of, alcoholic, liver, disease, non, alcoholic, liver, disease, occurs, in, people, with, little, or, no, history, of, alcohol, use, and, is, instead, strongly, associated, with, metabolic, syndrome, obesity, insulin, resistance, and, diabetes, and, hypertriglyceridemia, over, time, non, alcoholic, fatty, liver, disease, can, progress, to, non, alcoholic, steatohepatitis, which, additionally, involves, liver, cell, death, liver, inflammation, and, possible, fibrosis, factors, accelerating, progression, from, nafld, to, nash, are, obesity, older, age, non, african, american, ethnicity, female, gender, diabetes, mellitus, hypertension, higher, alt, or, ast, level, higher, ast, alt, ratio, low, platelet, count, and, an, ultrasound, steatosis, score, in, the, early, stages, as, with, nafld, and, early, nash, most, patients, are, asymptomatic, or, have, mild, right, upper, quadrant, pain, and, diagnosis, is, suspected, on, the, basis, of, abnormal, liver, function, tests, as, the, disease, progresses, symptoms, typical, of, chronic, hepatitis, may, develop, while, imaging, can, show, fatty, liver, only, liver, biopsy, can, demonstrate, inflammation, and, fibrosis, characteristic, of, nash, 9, to, 25, of, patients, with, nash, develop, cirrhosis, nash, is, recognized, as, the, third, most, common, cause, of, liver, disease, in, the, united, states, autoimmune, hepatitis, is, a, chronic, disease, caused, by, an, abnormal, immune, response, against, liver, cells, the, disease, is, thought, to, have, a, genetic, predisposition, as, it, is, associated, with, certain, human, leukocyte, antigens, involved, in, the, immune, response, as, in, other, autoimmune, diseases, circulating, auto, antibodies, may, be, present, and, are, helpful, in, diagnosis, auto, antibodies, found, in, patients, with, autoimmune, hepatitis, include, the, sensitive, but, less, specific, anti, nuclear, antibody, ana, smooth, muscle, antibody, sma, and, atypical, perinuclear, antineutrophil, cytoplasmic, antibody, p, anca, other, autoantibodies, that, are, less, common, but, more, specific, to, autoimmune, hepatitis, are, the, antibodies, against, liver, kidney, microsome, 1, lkm1, and, soluble, liver, antigen, sla, autoimmune, hepatitis, can, also, be, triggered, by, drugs, such, as, nitrofurantoin, hydralazine, and, methyldopa, after, liver, transplant, or, by, viruses, such, as, hepatitis, a, epstein, barr, virus, or, measles, autoimmune, hepatitis, can, present, anywhere, within, the, spectrum, from, asymptomatic, to, acute, or, chronic, hepatitis, to, fulminant, liver, failure, patients, are, asymptomatic, 25, 34, of, the, time, and, the, diagnosis, is, suspected, on, the, basis, of, abnormal, liver, function, tests, some, studies, show, between, 25, and, 75, of, cases, present, with, signs, and, symptoms, of, acute, hepatitis, as, with, other, autoimmune, diseases, autoimmune, hepatitis, usually, affects, young, females, though, it, can, affect, patients, of, either, sex, of, any, age, and, patients, can, exhibit, classic, signs, and, symptoms, of, autoimmunity, such, as, fatigue, anemia, anorexia, amenorrhea, acne, arthritis, pleurisy, thyroiditis, ulcerative, colitis, nephritis, and, maculopapular, rash, autoimmune, hepatitis, increases, the, risk, for, cirrhosis, and, the, risk, for, liver, cancer, is, increased, by, about, 1, for, each, year, of, the, disease, many, people, with, autoimmune, hepatitis, have, other, autoimmune, diseases, autoimmune, hepatitis, is, distinct, from, the, other, autoimmune, diseases, of, the, liver, primary, biliary, cirrhosis, and, primary, sclerosing, cholangitis, both, of, which, can, also, lead, to, scarring, fibrosis, and, cirrhosis, of, the, liver, genetic, causes, of, hepatitis, include, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, deficiency, hemochromatosis, and, wilson, s, disease, in, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, deficiency, a, co, dominant, mutation, in, the, gene, for, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, results, in, the, abnormal, accumulation, of, the, mutant, aat, protein, within, liver, cells, leading, to, liver, disease, hemochromatosis, and, wilson, s, disease, are, both, autosomal, recessive, diseases, involving, abnormal, storage, of, minerals, in, hemochromatosis, excess, amounts, of, iron, accumulate, in, multiple, body, sites, including, the, liver, which, can, lead, to, cirrhosis, in, wilson, s, disease, excess, amounts, of, copper, accumulate, in, the, liver, and, brain, causing, cirrhosis, and, dementia, when, the, liver, is, involved, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, deficiency, and, wilson, s, disease, tend, to, present, as, hepatitis, in, the, neonatal, period, or, in, childhood, hemochromatosis, typically, presents, in, adulthood, with, the, onset, of, clinical, disease, usually, after, age, 50, ischemic, hepatitis, also, known, as, shock, liver, results, from, reduced, blood, flow, to, the, liver, as, in, shock, heart, failure, or, vascular, insufficiency, the, condition, is, most, often, associated, with, heart, failure, but, can, also, be, caused, by, shock, or, sepsis, blood, testing, of, a, person, with, ischemic, hepatitis, will, show, very, high, levels, of, transaminase, enzymes, ast, and, alt, the, condition, usually, resolves, if, the, underlying, cause, is, treated, successfully, ischemic, hepatitis, rarely, causes, permanent, liver, damage, hepatitis, can, also, occur, in, neonates, and, is, attributable, to, a, variety, of, causes, some, of, which, are, not, typically, seen, in, adults, congenital, or, perinatal, infection, with, the, hepatitis, viruses, toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and, syphilis, can, cause, neonatal, hepatitis, structural, abnormalities, such, as, biliary, atresia, and, choledochal, cysts, can, lead, to, cholestatic, liver, injury, leading, to, neonatal, hepatitis, metabolic, diseases, such, as, glycogen, storage, disorders, and, lysosomal, storage, disorders, are, also, implicated, neonatal, hepatitis, can, be, idiopathic, and, in, such, cases, biopsy, often, shows, large, multinucleated, cells, in, the, liver, tissue, this, disease, is, termed, giant, cell, hepatitis, and, may, be, associated, with, viral, infection, autoimmune, disorders, and, drug, toxicity, the, specific, mechanism, varies, and, depends, on, the, underlying, cause, of, the, hepatitis, generally, there, is, an, initial, insult, that, causes, liver, injury, and, activation, of, an, inflammatory, response, which, can, become, chronic, leading, to, progressive, fibrosis, and, cirrhosis, the, pathway, by, which, hepatic, viruses, cause, viral, hepatitis, is, best, understood, in, the, case, of, hepatitis, b, and, c, the, viruses, do, not, directly, activate, apoptosis, cell, death, rather, infection, of, liver, cells, activates, the, innate, and, adaptive, arms, of, the, immune, system, leading, to, an, inflammatory, response, which, causes, cellular, damage, and, death, including, viral, induced, apoptosis, via, the, induction, of, the, death, receptor, mediated, signaling, pathway, depending, on, the, strength, of, the, immune, response, the, types, of, immune, cells, involved, and, the, ability, of, the, virus, to, evade, the, body, s, defense, infection, can, either, lead, to, clearance, acute, disease, or, persistence, chronic, disease, of, the, virus, the, chronic, presence, of, the, virus, within, liver, cells, results, in, multiple, waves, of, inflammation, injury, and, wound, healing, that, over, time, lead, to, scarring, or, fibrosis, and, culminate, in, hepatocellular, carcinoma, people, with, impaired, immune, response, are, at, greater, risk, of, developing, chronic, infection, natural, killer, cells, are, the, primary, drivers, of, the, initial, innate, response, and, create, a, cytokine, environment, that, results, in, the, recruitment, of, cd4, t, helper, and, cd8, cytotoxic, t, cells, type, i, interferons, are, the, cytokines, that, drive, the, antiviral, response, in, chronic, hepatitis, b, and, c, natural, killer, cell, function, is, impaired, steatohepatitis, is, seen, in, both, alcoholic, and, non, alcoholic, liver, disease, and, is, the, culmination, of, a, cascade, of, events, that, began, with, injury, in, the, case, of, non, alcoholic, steatohepatitis, this, cascade, is, initiated, by, changes, in, metabolism, associated, with, obesity, insulin, resistance, and, lipid, dysregulation, in, alcoholic, hepatitis, chronic, excess, alcohol, use, is, the, culprit, though, the, inciting, event, may, differ, the, progression, of, events, is, similar, and, begins, with, accumulation, of, free, fatty, acids, ffa, and, their, breakdown, products, in, the, liver, cells, in, a, process, called, steatosis, this, initially, reversible, process, overwhelms, the, hepatocyte, s, ability, to, maintain, lipid, homeostasis, leading, to, a, toxic, effect, as, fat, molecules, accumulate, and, are, broken, down, in, the, setting, of, an, oxidative, stress, response, over, time, this, abnormal, lipid, deposition, triggers, the, immune, system, via, toll, like, receptor, 4, tlr4, resulting, in, the, production, of, inflammatory, cytokines, such, as, tnf, that, cause, liver, cell, injury, and, death, these, events, mark, the, transition, to, steatohepatitis, and, in, the, setting, of, chronic, injury, fibrosis, eventually, develops, setting, up, events, that, lead, to, cirrhosis, and, hepatocellular, carcinoma, microscopically, changes, that, can, be, seen, include, steatosis, with, large, and, swollen, hepatocytes, ballooning, evidence, of, cellular, injury, and, cell, death, apoptosis, necrosis, evidence, of, inflammation, in, particular, in, zone, 3, of, the, liver, variable, degrees, of, fibrosis, and, mallory, bodies, diagnosis, of, hepatitis, is, made, on, the, basis, of, some, or, all, of, the, following, a, person, s, signs, and, symptoms, medical, history, including, sexual, and, substance, use, history, blood, tests, imaging, and, liver, biopsy, in, general, for, viral, hepatitis, and, other, acute, causes, of, hepatitis, the, person, s, blood, tests, and, clinical, picture, are, sufficient, for, diagnosis, for, other, causes, of, hepatitis, especially, chronic, causes, blood, tests, may, not, be, useful, in, this, case, liver, biopsy, is, the, gold, standard, for, establishing, the, diagnosis, histopathologic, analysis, is, able, to, reveal, the, precise, extent, and, pattern, of, inflammation, and, fibrosis, biopsy, is, typically, not, the, initial, diagnostic, test, because, it, is, invasive, and, is, associated, with, a, small, but, significant, risk, of, bleeding, that, is, increased, in, people, with, liver, injury, and, cirrhosis, blood, testing, includes, liver, enzymes, serology, i, e, for, autoantibodies, nucleic, acid, testing, i, e, for, hepatitis, virus, dna, rna, blood, chemistry, and, complete, blood, count, characteristic, patterns, of, liver, enzyme, abnormalities, can, point, to, certain, causes, or, stages, of, hepatitis, generally, ast, and, alt, are, elevated, in, most, cases, of, hepatitis, regardless, of, whether, the, person, shows, any, symptoms, the, degree, of, elevation, i, e, levels, in, the, hundreds, vs, in, the, thousands, the, predominance, for, ast, vs, alt, elevation, and, the, ratio, between, ast, and, alt, are, informative, of, the, diagnosis, ultrasound, ct, and, mri, can, all, identify, steatosis, fatty, changes, of, the, liver, tissue, and, nodularity, of, the, liver, surface, suggestive, of, cirrhosis, ct, and, especially, mri, are, able, to, provide, a, higher, level, of, detail, allowing, visualization, and, characterize, such, structures, as, vessels, and, tumors, within, the, liver, unlike, steatosis, and, cirrhosis, no, imaging, test, is, able, to, detect, liver, inflammation, i, e, hepatitis, or, fibrosis, liver, biopsy, is, the, only, definitive, diagnostic, test, that, is, able, to, assess, inflammation, and, fibrosis, of, the, liver, viral, hepatitis, is, primarily, diagnosed, through, blood, tests, for, levels, of, viral, antigens, such, as, the, hepatitis, b, surface, or, core, antigen, anti, viral, antibodies, such, as, the, anti, hepatitis, b, surface, antibody, or, anti, hepatitis, a, antibody, or, viral, dna, rna, in, early, infection, i, e, within, 1, week, igm, antibodies, are, found, in, the, blood, in, late, infection, and, after, recovery, igg, antibodies, are, present, and, remain, in, the, body, for, up, to, years, therefore, when, a, patient, is, positive, for, igg, antibody, but, negative, for, igm, antibody, he, is, considered, immune, from, the, virus, via, either, prior, infection, and, recovery, or, prior, vaccination, in, the, case, of, hepatitis, b, blood, tests, exist, for, multiple, virus, antigens, which, are, different, components, of, the, virion, particle, and, antibodies, the, combination, of, antigen, and, antibody, positivity, can, provide, information, about, the, stage, of, infection, acute, or, chronic, the, degree, of, viral, replication, and, the, infectivity, of, the, virus, the, most, apparent, distinguishing, factor, between, alcoholic, steatohepatitis, ash, and, nonalcoholic, steatohepatitis, nash, is, a, history, of, excessive, alcohol, use, thus, in, patients, who, have, no, or, negligible, alcohol, use, the, diagnosis, is, unlikely, to, be, alcoholic, hepatitis, in, those, who, drink, alcohol, the, diagnosis, may, just, as, likely, be, alcoholic, or, nonalcoholic, hepatitis, especially, if, there, is, concurrent, obesity, diabetes, and, metabolic, syndrome, in, this, case, alcoholic, and, nonalcoholic, hepatitis, can, be, distinguished, by, the, pattern, of, liver, enzyme, abnormalities, specifically, in, alcoholic, steatohepatitis, ast, alt, with, ratio, of, ast, alt, 2, 1, while, in, nonalcoholic, steatohepatitis, alt, ast, with, ratio, of, alt, ast, 1, 5, 1, liver, biopsies, show, identical, findings, in, patients, with, ash, and, nash, specifically, the, presence, of, polymorphonuclear, infiltration, hepatocyte, necrosis, and, apoptosis, in, the, form, of, ballooning, degeneration, mallory, bodies, and, fibrosis, around, veins, and, sinuses, the, purpose, of, screening, for, viral, hepatitis, is, to, identify, people, infected, with, the, disease, as, early, as, possible, even, before, symptoms, and, transaminase, elevations, may, be, present, this, allows, for, early, treatment, which, can, both, prevent, disease, progression, and, decrease, the, likelihood, of, transmission, to, others, hepatitis, a, causes, an, acute, illness, that, does, not, progress, to, chronic, liver, disease, therefore, the, role, of, screening, is, to, assess, immune, status, in, people, who, are, at, high, risk, of, contracting, the, virus, as, well, as, in, people, with, known, liver, disease, for, whom, hepatitis, a, infection, could, lead, to, liver, failure, people, in, these, groups, who, are, not, already, immune, can, receive, the, hepatitis, a, vaccine, those, at, high, risk, and, in, need, of, screening, include, the, presence, of, anti, hepatitis, a, igg, in, the, blood, indicates, past, infection, with, the, virus, or, prior, vaccination, the, cdc, who, uspstf, and, acog, recommend, routine, hepatitis, b, screening, for, certain, high, risk, populations, specifically, these, populations, include, people, who, are, screening, consists, of, a, blood, test, that, detects, hepatitis, b, surface, antigen, hbsag, if, hbsag, is, present, a, second, test, usually, done, on, the, same, blood, sample, that, detects, the, antibody, for, the, hepatitis, b, core, antigen, anti, hbcag, can, differentiate, between, acute, and, chronic, infection, people, who, are, high, risk, whose, blood, tests, negative, for, hbsag, can, receive, the, hepatitis, b, vaccine, to, prevent, future, infection, the, cdc, who, uspstf, aasld, and, acog, recommend, screening, people, at, high, risk, for, hepatitis, c, infection, these, populations, include, people, who, are, for, people, in, the, groups, above, whose, exposure, is, ongoing, screening, should, be, periodic, though, there, is, no, set, optimal, screening, interval, the, aasld, recommends, screening, men, who, have, sex, with, men, who, are, hiv, positive, annually, people, born, in, the, us, between, 1945, and, 1965, should, be, screened, once, unless, they, have, other, exposure, risks, screening, consists, of, a, blood, test, that, detects, anti, hepatitis, c, virus, antibody, if, anti, hepatitis, c, virus, antibody, is, present, a, confirmatory, test, to, detect, hcv, rna, indicates, chronic, disease, the, cdc, who, uspstf, aasld, and, acog, recommend, screening, people, at, high, risk, for, hepatitis, d, infection, these, populations, include, people, who, are, hepatitis, d, is, extremely, rare, symptoms, include, chronic, diarrhea, anal, and, intestinal, blisters, purple, urine, and, burnt, popcorn, scented, breath, screening, consists, of, a, blood, test, that, detects, the, anti, hepitits, d, virus, antibbody, if, anti, hepitits, d, virus, antibody, is, present, a, confirmatory, test, to, detect, hdv, rna, dna, indicates, chronic, disease, the, cdc, recommends, the, hepatitis, a, vaccine, for, all, children, beginning, at, age, one, as, well, as, for, those, who, have, not, been, previously, immunized, and, are, at, high, risk, for, contracting, the, disease, for, children, 12, months, of, age, or, older, the, vaccination, is, given, as, a, shot, into, the, muscle, in, two, doses, 6, 18, months, apart, and, should, be, started, before, the, age, 24, months, the, dosing, is, slightly, different, for, adults, depending, on, the, type, of, the, vaccine, if, the, vaccine, is, for, hepatitis, a, only, two, doses, are, given, 6, 18, months, apart, depending, on, the, manufacturer, if, the, vaccine, is, combined, hepatitis, a, and, hepatitis, b, up, to, 4, doses, may, be, required, the, cdc, recommends, the, routine, vaccination, of, all, children, under, the, age, of, 19, with, the, hepatitis, b, vaccine, they, also, recommend, it, for, those, who, desire, it, or, are, at, high, risk, routine, vaccination, for, hepatitis, b, starts, with, the, first, dose, administered, as, a, shot, into, the, muscle, before, the, newborn, is, discharged, from, the, hospital, an, additional, two, doses, should, be, administered, before, the, child, is, 18, months, for, babies, born, to, a, mother, with, hepatitis, b, surface, antigen, positivity, the, first, dose, is, unique, in, addition, to, the, vaccine, the, hepatitis, immune, globulin, should, also, be, administered, both, within, 12, hours, of, birth, these, newborns, should, also, be, regularly, tested, for, infection, for, at, least, the, first, year, of, life, there, is, also, a, combination, formulation, that, includes, both, hepatitis, a, and, b, vaccines, there, are, currently, no, vaccines, available, in, the, united, states, for, hepatitis, c, or, e, in, 2015, a, group, in, china, published, an, article, regarding, the, development, of, a, vaccine, for, hepatitis, e, as, of, march, 2016, the, united, states, government, was, in, the, process, of, recruiting, participants, for, the, phase, iv, trial, of, the, hepatitis, e, vaccine, because, hepatitis, a, is, transmitted, primarily, through, the, oral, fecal, route, the, mainstay, of, prevention, aside, from, vaccination, is, good, hygiene, access, to, clean, water, and, proper, handling, of, sewage, as, hepatitis, b, and, c, are, transmitted, through, blood, and, multiple, bodily, fluids, prevention, is, aimed, at, screening, blood, prior, to, transfusion, abstaining, from, the, use, of, injection, drugs, safe, needle, and, sharps, practices, in, healthcare, settings, and, safe, sex, practices, the, hepatitis, d, virus, requires, that, a, person, first, be, infected, with, hepatitis, b, virus, so, prevention, efforts, should, focus, on, limiting, the, spread, of, hepatitis, b, in, people, who, have, chronic, hepatitis, b, infection, and, are, at, risk, for, superinfection, with, the, hepatitis, d, virus, the, preventive, strategies, are, the, same, as, for, hepatitis, b, hepatitis, e, is, spread, primarily, through, the, oral, fecal, route, but, may, also, be, spread, by, blood, and, from, mother, to, fetus, the, mainstay, of, hepatitis, e, prevention, is, similar, to, that, for, hepatitis, a, namely, good, hygiene, and, clean, water, practices, as, excessive, alcohol, consumption, can, lead, to, hepatitis, and, cirrhosis, the, following, are, maximal, recommendations, for, alcohol, consumption, to, prevent, mafld, it, is, recommended, to, maintain, a, normal, weight, eat, a, healthy, diet, avoid, added, sugar, and, exercise, regularly, in, the, united, states, universal, immunization, has, led, to, a, two, thirds, decrease, in, hospital, admissions, and, medical, expenses, due, to, hepatitis, a, in, the, united, states, new, cases, of, hepatitis, b, decreased, 75, from, 1990, to, 2004, the, group, that, saw, the, greatest, decrease, was, children, and, adolescents, likely, reflecting, the, implementation, of, the, 1999, guidelines, hepatitis, c, infections, each, year, had, been, declining, since, the, 1980s, but, began, to, increase, again, in, 2006, the, data, are, unclear, as, to, whether, the, decline, can, be, attributed, to, needle, exchange, programmes, because, people, with, alcoholic, hepatitis, may, have, no, symptoms, it, can, be, difficult, to, diagnose, and, the, number, of, people, with, the, disease, is, probably, higher, than, many, estimates, programs, such, as, alcoholics, anonymous, have, been, successful, in, decreasing, death, due, to, cirrhosis, but, it, is, difficult, to, evaluate, their, success, in, decreasing, the, incidence, of, alcoholic, hepatitis, the, treatment, of, hepatitis, varies, according, to, the, type, whether, it, is, acute, or, chronic, and, the, severity, of, the, disease, hepatitis, a, usually, does, not, progress, to, a, chronic, state, and, rarely, requires, hospitalization, treatment, is, supportive, and, includes, such, measures, as, providing, intravenous, iv, hydration, and, maintaining, adequate, nutrition, rarely, people, with, the, hepatitis, a, virus, can, rapidly, develop, liver, failure, termed, fulminant, hepatic, failure, especially, the, elderly, and, those, who, had, a, pre, existing, liver, disease, especially, hepatitis, c, mortality, risk, factors, include, greater, age, and, chronic, hepatitis, c, in, these, cases, more, aggressive, supportive, therapy, and, liver, transplant, may, be, necessary, in, healthy, patients, 95, 99, recover, with, no, long, lasting, effects, and, antiviral, treatment, is, not, warranted, age, and, comorbid, conditions, can, result, in, a, more, prolonged, and, severe, illness, certain, patients, warrant, hospitalization, especially, those, who, present, with, clinical, signs, of, ascites, peripheral, edema, and, hepatic, encephalopathy, and, laboratory, signs, of, hypoglycemia, prolonged, prothrombin, time, low, serum, albumin, and, very, high, serum, bilirubin, in, these, rare, more, severe, acute, cases, patients, have, been, successfully, treated, with, antiviral, therapy, similar, to, that, used, in, cases, of, chronic, hepatitis, b, with, nucleoside, analogues, such, as, entecavir, or, tenofovir, as, there, is, a, dearth, of, clinical, trial, data, and, the, drugs, used, to, treat, are, prone, to, developing, resistance, experts, recommend, reserving, treatment, for, severe, acute, cases, not, mild, to, moderate, chronic, hepatitis, b, management, aims, to, control, viral,

cases, family, history, of, hcc, and, liver, biopsy, in, patients, with, compensated, cirrhosis, treatment, is, recommended, regardless, of, hbeag, status, or, alt, level, but, recommendations, differ, regarding, hbv, dna, levels, aasld, recommends, treating, at, dna, levels, detectable, above, 2x10, 3, iu, ml, easl, and, who, recommend, treating, when, hbv, dna, levels, are, detectable, at, any, level, in, patients, with, decompensated, cirrhosis, treatment, and, evaluation, for, liver, transplantation, are, recommended, in, all, cases, if, hbv, dna, is, detectable, currently, multidrug, treatment, is, not, recommended, in, treatment, of, chronic, hbv, as, it, is, no, more, effective, in, the, long, term, than, individual, treatment, with, entecavir, or, tenofovir, the, american, association, for, the, study, of, liver, diseases, and, the, infectious, diseases, society, of, america, aasld, idsa, recommend, antiviral, treatment, for, all, patients, with, chronic, hepatitis, c,

resulting, in, chronic, hepatitis, c, the, goal, of, treatment, is, prevention, of, hepatocellular, carcinoma, hcc, the, best, way, to, reduce, the, long, term, risk, of, hcc, is, to, achieve, sustained, virological, response, svr, svr, is, defined, as, an, undetectable, viral, load, at, 12, weeks, after, treatment, completion, and, indicates, a, cure, currently, available, treatments, include, indirect, and, direct, acting, antiviral, drugs, the, indirect, acting, antivirals, include, pegylated, interferon, peg, ifn, and, ribavirin, rbv, which, in, combination, have, historically, been, the, basis, of, therapy, for, hcv, duration, of, and, response, to, these, treatments, varies, based, on, genotype, these, agents, are, poorly, tolerated, but, are, still, used, in, some, resource, poor, areas, in, high, resource, countries, they, have, been, supplanted, by, direct, acting, antiviral, agents, which, first, appeared, in, 2011, these, agents, target, proteins, responsible, for, viral, replication, and, include, the, following, three, classes, these, drugs, are, used, in, various, combinations, sometimes, combined, with, ribavirin, based, on, the, patient,

infected, pregnant, women, hepatitis, e, infection, can, lead, to, fulminant, hepatitis, with, third, trimester, mortality, rates, as, high, as, 30, those, with, weakened, immune, systems, such, as, organ, transplant, recipients, are, also, susceptible, infection, is, rare, in, the, united, states, but, rates, are, high, in, the, developing, world, africa, asia, central, america, middle, east, many, genotypes, exist, and, are, differentially, distributed, around, the, world, there, is, some, evidence, of, hepatitis, e, infection, of, animals, serving, as, a, reservoir, for, human, infection, alcoholic, hepatitis, ah, in, its, severe, form, has, a, one, month, mortality, as, high, as, 50, most, people, who, develop, ah, are, men, but, women, are, at, higher, risk, of, developing, ah, and, its, complications, likely, secondary, to, high, body, fat, and, differences, in, alcohol, metabolism, other, contributing, factors, include, younger, age, 60, binge, pattern, drinking, poor, nutritional, status, obesity, and, hepatitis, c, co, infection, it, is, estimated, that, as, much, as, 20, of, people, with, ah, are, also, infected, with, hepatitis, c, in, this, population, the, presence, of, hepatitis, c, virus, leads, to, more, severe, disease, with, faster, progression, to, cirrhosis, hepatocellular, carcinoma, and, increased, mortality, obesity, increases, the, likelihood, of, progression, to, cirrhosis, in, cases, of, alcoholic, hepatitis, it, is, estimated, that, 70, of, people, who, have, ah, will, progress, to, cirrhosis, non, alcoholic, steatohepatitis, nash, is, projected, to, become, the, top, reason, for, liver, transplantation, in, the, united, states, by, 2020, supplanting, chronic, liver, disease, due, to, hepatitis, c, about, 20, 45, of, the, u, s, population, have, nafld, and, 6, have, nash, the, estimated, prevalence, of, nash, in, the, world, is, 3, 5, of, nash, patients, who, develop, cirrhosis, about, 2, per, year, will, likely, progress, to, hepatocellular, carcinoma, worldwide, the, estimated, prevalence, of, hepatocellular, carcinoma, related, to, nafld, is, 15, 30, nash, is, thought, to, be, the, primary, cause, of, cirrhosis, in, approximately, 25, of, patients, in, the, united, states, representing, 1, 2, of, the, general, population, initial, accounts, of, a, syndrome, that, we, now, think, is, likely, to, be, hepatitis, begin, to, occur, around, 3000, b, c, clay, tablets, that, served, as, medical, handbooks, for, the, ancient, sumerians, described, the, first, observations, of, jaundice, the, sumerians, believed, that, the, liver, was, the, home, of, the, soul, and, attributed, the, findings, of, jaundice, to, the, attack, of, the, liver, by, a, devil, named, ahhazu, around, 400, b, c, hippocrates, recorded, the, first, documentation, of, an, epidemic, jaundice, in, particular, noting, the, uniquely, fulminant, course, of, a, cohort, of, patients, who, all, died, within, two, weeks, he, wrote, the, bile, contained, in, the, liver, is, full, of, phlegm, and, blood, and, erupts, after, such, an, eruption, the, patient, soon, raves, becomes, angry, talks, nonsense, and, barks, like, a, dog, given, the, poor, sanitary, conditions, of, war, infectious, jaundice, played, a, large, role, as, a, major, cause, of, mortality, among, troops, in, the, napoleonic, wars, the, american, revolutionary, war, and, both, world, wars, during, world, war, ii, estimates, of, soldiers, affected, by, hepatitis, were, upwards, of, 10, million, during, world, war, ii, soldiers, received, vaccines, against, diseases, such, as, yellow, fever, but, these, vaccines, were, stabilized, with, human, serum, presumably, contaminated, with, hepatitis, viruses, which, often, created, epidemics, of, hepatitis, it, was, suspected, these, epidemics, were, due, to, a, separate, infectious, agent, and, not, due, to, the, yellow, fever, virus, itself, after, noting, 89, cases, of, jaundice, in, the, months, after, vaccination, out, of, a, total, 3, 100, patients, that, were, vaccinated, after, changing, the, seed, virus, strain, no, cases, of, jaundice, were, observed, in, the, subsequent, 8, 000, vaccinations, a, new, york, university, researcher, named, saul, krugman, continued, this, research, into, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, most, infamously, with, his, experiments, on, mentally, disabled, children, at, the, willowbrook, state, school, in, new, york, a, crowded, urban, facility, where, hepatitis, infections, were, highly, endemic, to, the, student, body, krugman, injected, students, with, gamma, globulin, a, type, of, antibody, after, observing, the, temporary, protection, against, infection, this, antibody, provided, he, then, tried, injected, live, hepatitis, virus, into, students, krugman, also, controversially, took, feces, from, infected, students, blended, it, into, milkshakes, and, fed, it, to, newly, admitted, children, his, research, was, received, with, much, controversy, as, people, protested, the, questionable, ethics, surrounding, the, chosen, target, population, henry, beecher, was, one, of, the, foremost, critics, in, an, article, in, the, new, england, journal, of, medicine, in, 1966, arguing, that, parents, were, unaware, to, the, risks, of, consent, and, that, the, research, was, done, to, benefit, others, at, the, expense, of, children, moreover, he, argued, that, poor, families, with, mentally, disabled, children, often, felt, pressured, to, join, the, research, project, to, gain, admission, to, the, school, with, all, of, the, educational, and, support, resources, that, would, come, along, with, it, others, in, the, medical, community, spoke, out, in, support, of, krugman, s, research, in, terms, of, its, widespread, benefits, and, understanding, of, the, hepatitis, virus, and, willowbrook, continues, to, be, a, commonly, cited, example, in, debates, about, medical, ethics, the, next, insight, regarding, hepatitis, b, was, a, serendipitous, one, by, dr, baruch, blumberg, a, researcher, at, the, nih, who, did, not, set, out, to, research, hepatitis, but, rather, studied, lipoprotein, genetics, he, travelled, across, the, globe, collecting, blood, samples, investigating, the, interplay, between, disease, environment, and, genetics, with, the, goal, of, designing, targeted, interventions, for, at, risk, people, that, could, prevent, them, from, getting, sick, he, noticed, an, unexpected, interaction, between, the, blood, of, a, patient, with, hemophilia, that, had, received, multiple, transfusions, and, a, protein, found, in, the, blood, of, an, indigenous, australian, person, he, named, the, protein, the, australia, antigen, and, made, it, the, focus, of, his, research, he, found, a, higher, prevalence, of, the, protein, in, the, blood, of, patients, from, developing, countries, compared, to, those, from, developed, ones, and, noted, associations, of, the, antigen, with, other, diseases, like, leukemia, and, down, syndrome, eventually, he, came, to, the, unifying, conclusion, that, the, australia, antigen, was, associated, with, viral, hepatitis, in, 1970, david, dane, first, isolated, the, hepatitis, b, virion, at, london, s, middlesex, hospital, and, named, the, virion, the, 42, nm, dane, particle, based, on, its, association, with, the, surface, of, the, hepatitis, b, virus, the, australia, antigen, was, renamed, to, hepatitis, b, surface, antigen, or, hbsag, blumberg, continued, to, study, the, antigen, and, eventually, developed, the, first, hepatitis, b, vaccine, using, plasma, rich, in, hbsag, for, which, he, received, the, nobel, prize, in, medicine, in, 1976, overall, hepatitis, accounts, for, a, significant, portion, of, healthcare, expenditures, in, both, developing, and, developed, nations, and, is, expected, to, rise, in, several, developing, countries, while, hepatitis, a, infections, are, self, limited, events, they, are, associated, with, significant, costs, in, the, united, states, it, has, been, estimated, that, direct, and, indirect, costs, are, approximately, 1817, and, 2459, respectively, per, case, and, that, an, average, of, 27, work, days, is, lost, per, infected, adult, a, 1997, report, demonstrated, that, a, single, hospitalization, related, to, hepatitis, a, cost, an, average, of, 6, 900, and, resulted, in, around, 500, million, in, total, annual, healthcare, costs, cost, effectiveness, studies, have, found, widespread, vaccination, of, adults, to, not, be, feasible, but, have, stated, that, a, combination, hepatitis, a, and, b, vaccination, of, children, and, at, risk, groups, people, from, endemic, areas, healthcare, workers, may, be, hepatitis, b, accounts, for, a, much, larger, percentage, of, health, care, spending, in, endemic, regions, like, asia, in, 1997, it, accounted, for, 3, 2, of, south, korea, s, total, health, care, expenditures, and, resulted, in, 696, million, in, direct, costs, a, large, majority, of, that, sum, was, spent, on, treating, disease, symptoms, and, complications, chronic, hepatitis, b, infections, are, not, as, endemic, in, the, united, states, but, accounted, for, 357, million, in, hospitalization, costs, in, the, year, 1990, that, number, grew, to, 1, 5, billion, in, 2003, but, remained, stable, as, of, 2006, which, may, be, attributable, to, the, introduction, of, effective, drug, therapies, and, vaccination, campaigns, people, infected, with, chronic, hepatitis, c, tend, to, be, frequent, users, of, the, health, care, system, globally, it, has, been, estimated, that, a, person, infected, with, hepatitis, c, in, the, united, states, will, result, in, a, monthly, cost, of, 691, that, number, nearly, doubles, to, 1, 227, for, people, with, compensated, stable, cirrhosis, while, the, monthly, cost, of, people, with, decompensated, worsening, cirrhosis, is, almost, five, times, as, large, at, 3, 682, the, wide, ranging, effects, of, hepatitis, make, it, difficult, to, estimate, indirect, costs, but, studies, have, speculated, that, the, total, cost, is, 6, 5, billion, annually, in, the, united, states, in, canada, 56, of, hcv, related, costs, are, attributable, to, cirrhosis, and, total, expenditures, related, to, the, virus, are, expected, to, peak, at, cad, 396, million, in, the, year, 2032, the, largest, outbreak, of, hepatitis, a, virus, in, united, states, history, occurred, among, people, who, ate, at, a, now, defunct, mexican, food, restaurant, located, in, monaca, pennsylvania, in, late, 2003, over, 550, people, who, visited, the, restaurant, between, september, and, october, 2003, were, infected, with, the, virus, three, of, whom, died, as, a, direct, result, the, outbreak, was, brought, to, the, attention, of, health, officials, when, local, emergency, medicine, physicians, noticed, a, significant, increase, in, cases, of, hepatitis, a, in, the, county, after, conducting, its, investigation, the, cdc, attributed, the, source, of, the, outbreak, to, the, use, of, contaminated, raw, green, onion, the, restaurant, was, purchasing, its, green, onion, stock, from, farms, in, mexico, at, the, time, it, is, believed, that, the, green, onions, may, have, been, contaminated, through, the, use, of, contaminated, water, for, crop, irrigation, rinsing, or, icing, or, by, handling, of, the, vegetables, by, infected, people, green, onion, had, caused, similar, outbreaks, of, hepatitis, a, in, the, southern, united, states, prior, to, this, but, not, to, the, same, magnitude, the, cdc, believes, that, the, restaurant, s, use, of, a, large, communal, bucket, for, chopped, raw, green, onion, allowed, non, contaminated, plants, to, be, mixed, with, contaminated, ones, increasing, the, number, of, vectors, of, infection, and, amplifying, the, outbreak, the, restaurant, was, closed, once, it, was, discovered, to, be, the, source, and, over, 9, 000, people, were, given, hepatitis, a, immune, globulin, because, they, had, either, eaten, at, the, restaurant, or, had, been, in, close, contact, with, someone, who, had, persons, infected, with, hiv, have, a, particularly, high, burden, of, hiv, hcv, co, infection, in, a, recent, study, by, the, who, the, likelihood, of, being, infected, with, hepatitis, c, virus, was, six, times, greater, in, those, who, also, had, hiv, the, prevalence, of, hiv, hcv, co, infection, worldwide, was, estimated, to, be, 6, 2, representing, more, than, 2, 2, million, people, intravenous, drug, use, was, an, independent, risk, factor, for, hcv, infection, in, the, who, study, the, prevalence, of, hiv, hcv, co, infection, was, markedly, higher, at, 82, 4, in, those, who, injected, drugs, compared, to, the, general, population, 2, 4, in, a, study, of, hiv, hcv, co, infection, among, hiv, positive, men, who, have, sex, with, men, msm, the, overall, prevalence, of, anti, hepatitis, c, antibodies, was, estimated, to, be, 8, 1, and, increased, to, 40, among, hiv, positive, msm, who, also, injected, drugs, vertical, transmission, is, a, significant, contributor, of, new, hbv, cases, each, year, with, 35, 50, of, transmission, from, mother, to, neonate, in, endemic, countries, vertical, transmission, occurs, largely, via, a, neonate, s, exposure, to, maternal, blood, and, vaginal, secretions, during, birth, while, the, risk, of, progression, to, chronic, infection, is, approximately, 5, among, adults, who, contract, the, virus, it, is, as, high, as, 95, among, neonates, subject, to, vertical, transmission, the, risk, of, viral, transmission, is, approximately, 10, 20, when, maternal, blood, is, positive, for, hbsag, and, up, to, 90, when, also, positive, for, hbeag, given, the, high, risk, of, perinatal, transmission, the, cdc, recommends, screening, all, pregnant, women, for, hbv, at, their, first, prenatal, visit, it, is, safe, for, non, immune, pregnant, women, to, receive, the, hbv, vaccine, based, on, the, limited, available, evidence, the, american, association, for, the, study, of, liver, diseases, aasld, recommends, antiviral, therapy, in, pregnant, women, whose, viral, load, exceeds, 200, 000, iu, ml, a, growing, body, of, evidence, shows, that, antiviral, therapy, initiated, in, the, third, trimester, significantly, reduces, transmission, to, the, neonate, a, systematic, review, of, the, antiretroviral, pregnancy, registry, database, found, that, there, was, no, increased, risk, of, congenital, anomalies, with, tenofovir, for, this, reason, along, with, its, potency, and, low, risk, of, resistance, the, aasld, recommends, this, drug, a, 2010, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, found, that, lamivudine, initiated, early, in, the, third, trimester, also, significantly, reduced, mother, to, child, transmission, of, hbv, without, any, known, adverse, effects, the, acog, states, that, the, evidence, available, does, not, suggest, any, particular, mode, of, delivery, i, e, vaginal, vs, cesarean, is, better, at, reducing, vertical, transmission, in, mothers, with, hbv, the, who, and, cdc, recommend, that, neonates, born, to, mothers, with, hbv, should, receive, hepatitis, b, immune, globulin, hbig, as, well, as, the, hbv, vaccine, within, 12, hours, of, birth, for, infants, who, have, received, hbig, and, the, hbv, vaccine, breastfeeding,

negative, women, the, same, study, found, the, risk, of, vertical, transmission, to, be, 10, 8, in, hcv, positive, hiv, positive, women, other, studies, have, found, the, risk, of, vertical, transmission, to, be, as, high, as, 44, among, hiv, positive, women, the, risk, of, vertical, transmission, is, higher, when, the, virus, is, detectable, in, the, mother, s, blood, evidence, does, not, indicate, that, mode, of, delivery, i, e, vaginal, vs, cesarean, has, an, effect, on, vertical, transmission, for, women, who, are, hcv, positive, and, hiv, negative, breastfeeding, is, safe, cdc, guidelines, suggest, avoiding, it, if, a, woman, s, nipples, are, cracked, or, bleeding, to, reduce, the, risk, of, transmission, pregnant, women, who, contract, hev, are, at, significant, risk, of, developing, fulminant, hepatitis, with, maternal, mortality, rates, as, high, as, 20, 30, most, commonly, in, the, third, trimester, a, 2016, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, of, 47,
