the, stoat, mustela, erminea, also, known, as, the, eurasian, ermine, or, ermine, is, a, species, of, mustelid, native, to, eurasia, and, the, northern, regions, of, north, america, because, of, its, wide, circumpolar, distribution, it, is, listed, as, least, concern, on, the, iucn, red, list, the, name, ermine, r, m, n, is, used, especially, in, its, pure, white, winter, coat, of, the, stoat, or, its, fur, ermine, fur, was, used, in, the, 15th, century, by, catholic, monarchs, who, sometimes, used, it, as, the, mozzetta, cape, it, has, long, been, used, on, the, ceremonial, robes, of, members, of, the, united, kingdom, house, of, lords, it, was, also, used, in, capes, on, images, such, as, the, infant, jesus, of, prague, the, stoat, was, introduced, into, new, zealand, in, the, late, 19th, century, to, control, rabbits, but, had, a, devastating, effect, on, native, bird, populations, and, was, nominated, as, one, of, the, world, s, top, 100, worst, invaders, the, root, word, for, stoat, is, likely, either, the, dutch, word, stout, bold, or, the, gothic, word, stautan, to, push, according, to, john, guillim, in, his, display, of, heraldrie, the, word, ermine, is, likely, derived, from, armenia, the, nation, where, it, was, thought, the, species, originated, though, other, authors, have, linked, it, to, the, norman, french, from, the, teutonic, harmin, anglo, saxon, hearma, this, seems, to, come, from, the, lithuanian, word, armu, in, ireland, where, the, least, weasel, does, not, occur, the, stoat, is, referred, to, as, a, weasel, while, in, north, america, it, is, called, a, short, tailed, weasel, a, male, stoat, is, called, a, dog, hob, or, jack, while, a, female, is, called, a, jill, the, collective, noun, for, stoats, is, either, gang, or, pack, formerly, considered, a, single, species, with, a, very, wide, circumpolar, range, a, 2021, study, split, m, erminea, into, three, species, m, erminea, sensu, stricto, eurasia, and, northern, north, america, m, richardsonii, most, of, north, america, and, m, haidarum, several, islands, off, the, pacific, northwest, coast, as, of, 2021, 21, subspecies, are, recognized, nominate, subspecies, maculata,

direct, ancestor, was, mustela, palerminea, a, common, carnivore, in, central, and, eastern, europe, during, the, middle, pleistocene, that, spread, to, north, america, during, the, late, blancan, or, early, irvingtonian, the, stoat, is, the, product, of, a, process, that, began, 5, 7, million, years, ago, when, northern, forests, were, replaced, by, open, grassland, thus, prompting, an, explosive, evolution, of, small, burrowing, rodents, the, stoat, s, ancestors, were, larger, than, the, current, form, and, underwent, a, reduction, in, size, as, they, exploited, the, new, food, source, the, stoat, first, arose, in, eurasia, shortly, after, the, long, tailed, weasel, which, is, in, a, different, genus, neogale, arose, as, its, mirror, image, in, north, america, 2, million, years, ago, the, stoat, thrived, during, the, ice, age, as, its, small, size, and, long, body, allowed, it, to, easily, operate, beneath, snow, as, well, as, hunt, in, burrows, the, stoat, and, the, long, tailed, weasel, remained, separated, until, 500, 000, years, ago, when, falling, sea, levels, exposed, the, bering, land, bridge, fossilised, stoat, remains, have, been, recovered, from, denisova, cave, combined, phylogenetic, analyses, indicate, the, stoat, s, closest, living, relatives, are, the, american, ermine, m, richardsonii, and, haida, ermine, m, haidarum, the, latter, of, which, partially, descends, from, m, erminea, it, is, basal, to, most, other, members, of, mustela, with, only, the, yellow, bellied, m, kathia, malayan, m, katiah, and, back, striped, m, strigidorsa, weasels, being, more, basal, the, mountain, weasel, mustela, altaica, was, formerly, considered, its, closest, relative, although, more, recent, analyses, have, found, it, to, be, significantly, more, derived, it, was, also, previously, thought, to, be, allied, with, members, of, the, genus, neogale, such, as, the, long, tailed, weasel, but, as, those, species, have, since, been, separated, into, a, new, genus, this, is, likely, not, the, case, the, stoat, is, similar, to, the, least, weasel, in, general, proportions, manner, of, posture, and, movement, though, the, tail, is, relatively, longer, always, exceeding, a, third, of, the, body, length, though, it, is, shorter, than, that, of, the, long, tailed, weasel, the, stoat, has, an, elongated, neck, the, head, being, set, exceptionally, far, in, front, of, the, shoulders, the, trunk, is, nearly, cylindrical, and, does, not, bulge, at, the, abdomen, the, greatest, circumference, of, body, is, little, more, than, half, its, length, the, skull, although, very, similar, to, that, of, the, least, weasel, is, relatively, longer, with, a, narrower, braincase, the, projections, of, the, skull, and, teeth, are, weakly, developed, but, stronger, than, those, of, the, least, weasel, the, eyes, are, round, black, and, protrude, slightly, the, whiskers, are, brown, or, white, in, colour, and, very, long, the, ears, are, short, rounded, and, lie, almost, flattened, against, the, skull, the, claws, are, not, retractable, and, are, large, in, proportion, to, the, digits, each, foot, has, five, toes, the, male, stoat, has, a, curved, baculum, with, a, proximal, knob, that, increases, in, weight, as, it, ages, fat, is, deposited, primarily, along, the, spine, and, kidneys, then, on, gut, mesenteries, under, the, limbs, and, around, the, shoulders, the, stoat, has, four, pairs, of, nipples, though, they, are, visible, only, in, females, the, dimensions, of, the, stoat, are, variable, but, not, as, significantly, as, the, least, weasel, s, unusual, among, the, carnivora, the, size, of, stoats, tends, to, decrease, proportionally, with, latitude, in, contradiction, to, bergmann, s, rule, sexual, dimorphism, in, size, is, pronounced, with, males, being, roughly, 25, larger, than, females, and, 1, 5, 2, 0, times, their, weight, on, average, males, measure, 187, 325, mm, 7, 4, 12, 8, in, in, body, length, while, females, measure, 170, 270, mm, 6, 7, 10, 6, in, the, tail, measures, 75, 120, mm, 3, 0, 4, 7, in, in, males, and, 65, 106, mm, 2, 6, 4, 2, in, in, females, in, males, the, hind, foot, measures, 40, 0, 48, 2, mm, 1, 57, 1, 90, in, while, in, females, it, is, 37, 0, 47, 6, mm, 1, 46, 1, 87, in, the, height, of, the, ear, measures, 18, 0, 23, 2, mm, 0, 71, 0, 91, in, in, males, and, 14, 0, 23, 3, mm, 0, 55, 0, 92, in, the, skulls, of, males, measure, 39, 3, 52, 2, mm, 1, 55, 2, 06, in, in, length, while, those, of, females, measure, 35, 7, 45, 8, mm, 1, 41, 1, 80, in, males, average, 258, g, 9, 1, oz, in, weight, while, females, weigh, less, than, 180, g, 6, 3, oz, the, stoat, has, large, anal, scent, glands, measuring, 8, 5, mm, 5, mm, 0, 33, in, 0, 20, in, in, males, and, smaller, in, females, scent, glands, are, also, present, on, the, cheeks, belly, and, flanks, epidermal, secretions, which, are, deposited, during, body, rubbing, are, chemically, distinct, from, the, products, of, the, anal, scent, glands, which, contain, a, higher, proportion, of, volatile, chemicals, when, attacked, or, being, aggressive, the, stoat, secretes, the, contents, of, its, anal, glands, giving, rise, to, a, strong, musky, odour, produced, by, several, sulphuric, compounds, the, odour, is, distinct, from, that, of, least, weasels, the, winter, fur, is, very, dense, and, silky, but, quite, closely, lying, and, short, while, the, summer, fur, is, rougher, shorter, and, sparse, in, summer, the, fur, is, sandy, brown, on, the, back, and, head, and, a, white, below, the, division, between, the, dark, back, and, the, light, belly, is, usually, straight, though, this, trait, is, only, present, in, 13, 5, of, irish, stoats, the, stoat, moults, twice, a, year, in, spring, the, moult, is, slow, starting, from, the, forehead, across, the, back, toward, the, belly, in, autumn, the, moult, is, quicker, progressing, in, the, reverse, direction, the, moult, initiated, by, photoperiod, starts, earlier, in, autumn, and, later, in, spring, at, higher, latitudes, in, the, stoat, s, northern, range, it, adopts, a, completely, white, coat, save, for, the, black, tail, tip, during, the, winter, period, differences, in, the, winter, and, summer, coats, are, less, apparent, in, southern, forms, of, the, species, in, the, species, southern, range, the, coat, remains, brown, but, is, denser, and, sometimes, paler, than, in, summer, the, stoat, has, a, circumboreal, range, throughout, north, america, europe, and, asia, the, stoat, in, europe, is, found, as, far, south, as, 41, n, in, portugal, and, inhabits, most, islands, with, the, exception, of, iceland, svalbard, the, mediterranean, islands, and, some, small, north, atlantic, islands, in, japan, it, is, present, in, central, mountains, northern, and, central, japanese, alps, to, northern, part, of, honshu, primarily, above, 1, 200, m, and, hokkaido, its, vertical, range, is, from, sea, level, to, 3, 000, m, 9, 800, ft, in, north, america, it, is, found, throughout, alaska, and, western, yukon, to, most, of, arctic, canada, east, to, greenland, throughout, the, rest, of, north, america, as, well, as, parts, of, nunavut, including, baffin, island, and, some, islands, in, southeast, alaska, it, is, replaced, by, m, richardsonii, stoats, were, introduced, into, new, zealand, during, the, late, 19th, century, to, control, rabbits, and, hares, but, are, now, a, major, threat, to, native, bird, populations, the, introduction, of, stoats, was, opposed, by, scientists, in, new, zealand, and, britain, including, the, new, zealand, ornithologist, walter, buller, the, warnings, were, ignored, and, stoats, began, to, be, introduced, from, britain, in, the, 1880s, resulting, in, a, noticeable, decline, in, bird, populations, within, six, years, stoats, are, a, serious, threat, to, ground, and, hole, nesting, birds, since, the, latter, have, very, few, means, of, escaping, predation, the, highest, rates, of, stoat, predation, occur, after, seasonal, gluts, in, southern, beechmast, beechnuts, which, enable, the, reproduction, of, rodents, on, which, stoats, also, feed, enabling, stoats, to, increase, their, own, numbers, for, instance, the, endangered, south, island, takah, s, wild, population, dropped, by, a, third, between, 2006, and, 2007, after, a, stoat, plague, triggered, by, the, 2005, 06, mast, wiped, out, more, than, half, the, takah, in, untrapped, areas, in, the, northern, hemisphere, mating, occurs, in, the, april, july, period, in, spring, the, male, s, testes, are, enlarged, a, process, accompanied, by, an, increase, of, testosterone, concentration, in, the, plasma, spermatogenesis, occurs, in, december, and, the, males, are, fertile, from, may, to, august, after, which, the, testes, regress, female, stoats, are, usually, only, in, heat, for, a, brief, period, which, is, triggered, by, changes, in, day, length, copulation, can, last, as, long, as, 1, hour, stoats, are, not, monogamous, with, litters, often, being, of, mixed, paternity, stoats, undergo, embryonic, diapause, meaning, that, the, embryo, does, not, immediately, implant, in, the, uterus, after, fertilization, but, rather, lies, dormant, for, a, period, of, nine, to, ten, months, the, gestation, period, is, therefore, variable, but, typically, around, 300, days, and, after, mating, in, the, summer, the, offspring, will, not, be, born, until, the, following, spring, adult, female, stoats, spend, almost, all, their, lives, either, pregnant, or, in, heat, females, can, reabsorb, embryos, and, in, the, event, of, a, severe, winter, they, may, reabsorb, their, entire, litter, males, play, no, part, in, rearing, the, young, which, are, born, blind, deaf, toothless, and, covered, in, fine, white, or, pinkish, down, the, milk, teeth, erupt, after, three, weeks, and, solid, food, is, eaten, after, four, weeks, the, eyes, open, after, five, to, six, weeks, with, the, black, tail, tip, appearing, a, week, later, lactation, ends, after, 12, weeks, prior, to, the, age, of, five, to, seven, weeks, kits, have, poor, thermoregulation, so, they, huddle, for, warmth, when, the, mother, is, absent, males, become, sexually, mature, at, 10, 11, months, while, females, are, sexually, mature, at, the, age, of, 2, 3, weeks, whilst, still, blind, deaf, and, hairless, and, are, usually, mated, with, adult, males, before, being, weaned, stoat, territoriality, has, a, generally, mustelid, spacing, pattern, with, male, territories, encompassing, smaller, female, territories, which, they, defend, from, other, males, the, size, of, the, territory, and, the, ranging, behaviour, of, its, occupants, varies, seasonally, depending, on, the, abundance, of, food, and, mates, during, the, breeding, season, the, ranges, of, females, remain, unchanged, while, males, either, become, roamers, strayers, or, transients, dominant, older, males, have, territories, 50, times, larger, than, those, of, younger, socially, inferior, males, both, sexes, mark, their, territories, with, urine, faeces, and, two, types, of, scent, marks, anal, drags, are, meant, to, convey, territorial, occupancy, and, body, rubbing, is, associated, with, agonistic, encounters, the, stoat, does, not, dig, its, own, burrows, instead, using, the, burrows, and, nest, chambers, of, the, rodents, it, kills, the, skins, and, underfur, of, rodent, prey, are, used, to, line, the, nest, chamber, the, nest, chamber, is, sometimes, located, in, seemingly, unsuitable, places, such, as, among, logs, piled, against, the, walls, of, houses, the, stoat, also, inhabits, old, and, rotting, stumps, under, tree, roots, in, heaps, of, brushwood, haystacks, in, bog, hummocks, in, the, cracks, of, vacant, mud, buildings, in, rock, piles, rock, clefts, and, even, in, magpie, nests, males, and, females, typically, live, apart, but, close, to, each, other, each, stoat, has, several, dens, dispersed, within, its, range, a, single, den, has, several, galleries, mainly, within, 30, cm, 12, in, of, the, surface, as, with, the, least, weasel, mouse, like, rodents, predominate, in, the, stoat, s, diet, it, regularly, preys, on, larger, rodent, and, lagomorph, species, and, takes, individuals, far, larger, than, itself, in, russia, its, prey, includes, rodents, and, lagomorphs, such, as, european, water, voles, common, hamsters, pikas, and, others, which, it, overpowers, in, their, burrows, prey, species, of, secondary, importance, include, small, birds, fish, and, shrews, and, more, rarely, amphibians, lizards, and, insects, it, also, preys, on, lemmings, in, great, britain, european, rabbits, are, an, important, food, source, with, the, frequency, in, which, stoats, prey, on, them, having, increased, between, the, 1960s, and, mid, 1990s, since, the, end, of, the, myxomatosis, epidemic, typically, male, stoats, prey, on, rabbits, more, frequently, than, females, do, which, depend, to, a, greater, extent, on, smaller, rodent, species, british, stoats, rarely, kill, shrews, rats, squirrels, and, water, voles, though, rats, may, be, an, important, food, source, locally, in, ireland, shrews, and, rats, are, frequently, eaten, in, mainland, europe, water, voles, make, up, a, large, portion, of, the, stoat, s, diet, hares, are, sometimes, taken, but, are, usually, young, specimens, in, new, zealand, the, stoat, feeds, principally, on, birds, including, the, rare, kiwi, kaka, mohua, yellow, crowned, parakeet, and, new, zealand, dotterel, cases, are, known, of, stoats, preying, on, young, muskrats, the, stoat, typically, eats, about, 50, g, 1, 8, oz, of, food, a, day, which, is, equivalent, to, 25, of, the, animal, s, live, weight, the, stoat, is, an, opportunistic, predator, that, moves, rapidly, and, checks, every, available, burrow, or, crevice, for, food, because, of, their, larger, size, male, stoats, are, less, successful, than, females, in, pursuing, rodents, far, into, tunnels, stoats, regularly, climb, trees, to, gain, access, to, birds, nests, and, are, common, raiders, of, nest, boxes, particularly, those, of, large, species, the, stoat, reputedly, mesmerises, prey, such, as, rabbits, by, a, dance, sometimes, called, the, weasel, war, dance, though, this, behaviour, could, be, linked, to, skrjabingylus, infections, the, stoat, seeks, to, immobilize, large, prey, such, as, rabbits, with, a, bite, to, the, spine, at, the, back, of, the, neck, the, stoat, may, surplus, kill, when, the, opportunity, arises, though, excess, prey, is, usually, cached, and, eaten, later, to, avoid, obesity, as, overweight, stoats, tend, to, be, at, a, disadvantage, when, pursuing, prey, into, their, burrows, small, prey, typically, die, instantly, from, a, bite, to, the, back, of, the, neck, while, larger, prey, such, as, rabbits, typically, die, of, shock, as, the, stoat, s, canine, teeth, are, too, short, to, reach, the, spinal, column, or, major, arteries, the, stoat, is, a, usually, silent, animal, but, can, produce, a, range, of, sounds, similar, to, those, of, the, least, weasel, kits, produce, a, fine, chirping, noise, adults, trill, excitedly, before, mating, and, indicate, submission, through, quiet, trilling, whining, and, squealing, when, nervous, the, stoat, hisses, and, will, intersperse, this, with, sharp, barks, or, shrieks, and, prolonged, screeching, when, aggressive, aggressive, behavior, in, stoats, is, categorized, in, these, forms, submissive, stoats, express, their, status, by, avoiding, higher, ranking, animals, fleeing, from, them, or, making, whining, or, squealing, sounds, larger, mammalian, predators, such, as, red, foxes, vulpes, vulpes, and, sables, martes, zibellina, are, known, to, prey, on, stoats, additionally, a, wide, range, of, birds, of, prey, can, take, stoats, from, small, northern, hawk, owls, surnia, ulula, and, short, eared, owls, asio, flammeus, to, various, buzzards, kites, goshawks, and, even, eurasian, eagle, owls, bubo, bubo, and, golden, eagles, aquila, chrysaetos, although, not, classified, as, birds, of, prey, grey, herons, ardea, cinerea, are, known, to, prey, on, stoats, tuberculosis, has, been, recorded, in, stoats, inhabiting, the, former, soviet, union, and, new, zealand, they, are, largely, resistant, to, tularemia, but, are, reputed, to, suffer, from, canine, distemper, in, captivity, symptoms, of, mange, have, also, been, recorded, stoats, are, vulnerable, to, ectoparasites, associated, with, their, prey, and, the, nests, of, other, animals, on, which, they, do, not, prey, the, louse, trichodectes, erminea, is, recorded, in, stoats, living, in, canada, ireland, and, new, zealand, in, continental, europe, 26, flea, species, are, recorded, to, infest, stoats, including, rhadinospylla, pentacantha, megabothris, rectangulatus, orchopeas, howardi, spilopsyllus, ciniculus, ctenophthalamus, nobilis, dasypsyllus, gallinulae, nosopsyllus, fasciatus, leptospylla, segnis, ceratophyllus, gallinae, parapsyllus, n, nestoris, amphipsylla, kuznetzovi, and, ctenopsyllus, bidentatus, tick, species, known, to, infest, stoats, are, ixodes, canisuga, i, hexagonus, and, i, ricinus, and, haemaphysalis, longicornis, louse, species, known, to, infest, stoats, include, mysidea, picae, and, polyplax, spinulosa, mite, species, known, to, infest, stoats, include, neotrombicula, autumnalis, demodex, erminae, eulaelaps, stabulans, gymnolaelaps, annectans, hypoaspis, nidicorva, and, listrophorus, mustelae, the, nematode, skrjabingylus, nasicola, is, particularly, threatening, to, stoats, as, it, erodes, the, bones, of, the, nasal, sinuses, and, decreases, fertility, other, nematode, species, known, to, infect, stoats, include, capillaria, putorii, molineus, patens, and, strongyloides, martes, cestode, species, known, to, infect, stoats, include, taenia, tenuicollis, mesocestoides, lineatus, and, rarely, acanthocephala, in, irish, mythology, stoats, were, viewed, anthropomorphically, as, animals, with, families, which, held, rituals, for, their, dead, they, were, also, viewed, as, noxious, animals, prone, to, thieving, and, their, saliva, was, said, to, be, able, to, poison, a, grown, man, to, encounter, a, stoat, when, setting, out, for, a, journey, was, considered, bad, luck, but, one, could, avert, this, by, greeting, the, stoat, as, a, neighbour, stoats, were, also, supposed, to, hold, the, souls, of, infants, who, died, before, baptism, in, the, folklore, of, the, komi, people, of, the, urals, stoats, are, symbolic, of, beautiful, and, coveted, young, women, in, the, zoroastrian, religion, the, stoat, is, considered, a, sacred, animal, as, its, white, winter, coat, represented, purity, similarly, mary, magdalene, was, depicted, as, wearing, a, white, stoat, pelt, as, a, sign, of, her, reformed, character, one, popular, european, legend, had, it, that, a, white, stoat, would, die, before, allowing, its, pure, white, coat, to, be, besmirched, when, it, was, being, chased, by, hunters, it, would, supposedly, turn, around, and, give, itself, up, to, the, hunters, rather, than, risk, soiling, itself, the, former, nation, now, region, of, brittany, in, france, uses, a, stylized, ermine, fur, pattern, in, forming, the, coat, of, arms, and, flag, of, brittany, gilles, servat, s, song, la, blanche, hermine, the, white, ermine, became, an, anthem, for, bretons, and, is, popular, among, french, people, in, general, in, the, 16th, century, chinese,

coat, and, used, to, trim, coats, and, stoles, the, fur, from, the, winter, coat, is, referred, to, as, ermine, and, is, the, traditional, ancient, symbol, of, the, duchy, of, brittany, forming, its, earliest, flag, there, is, also, a, design, called, ermine, inspired, by, the, winter, coat, of, the, stoat, and, painted, onto, other, furs, such, as, rabbit, in, europe, these, furs, are, a, symbol, of, royalty, and, high, status, the, ceremonial, robes, of, members, of, the, united, kingdom, house, of, lords, and, the, academic, hoods, of, the, universities, of, oxford, and, cambridge, are, traditionally, trimmed, with, ermine, in, practice, rabbit, or, fake, fur, is, now, often, used, due, to, expense, or, animal, rights, concerns, prelates, of, the, catholic, church, still, wear, ecclesiastical, garments, featuring, ermine, a, sign, of, their, status, equal, to, that, of, the, nobility, cecilia, gallerani, is, depicted, holding, an, ermine, in, her, portrait, lady, with, an,
