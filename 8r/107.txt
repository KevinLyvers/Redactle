fur, is, a, thick, growth, of, hair, that, covers, the, skin, of, almost, all, mammals, it, consists, of, a, combination, of, oily, guard, hair, on, top, and, thick, underfur, beneath, the, guard, hair, keeps, moisture, from, reaching, the, skin, the, underfur, acts, as, an, insulating, blanket, that, keeps, the, animal, warm, the, fur, of, mammals, has, many, uses, protection, sensory, purposes, waterproofing, and, camouflaging, with, the, primary, usage, being, thermoregulation, the, types, of, hair, include, 99, hair, length, is, negligible, in, thermoregulation, as, some, tropical, mammals, such, as, sloths, have, the, same, fur, length, as, some, arctic, mammals, but, with, less, insulation, and, conversely, other, tropical, mammals, with, short, hair, have, the, same, insulating, value, as, arctic, mammals, the, denseness, of, fur, can, increase, an, animal, s, insulation, value, and, arctic, mammals, especially, have, dense, fur, for, example, the, muskox, has, guard, hairs, measuring, 30, cm, 12, in, as, well, as, a, dense, underfur, which, forms, an, airtight, coat, allowing, them, to, survive, in, temperatures, of, 40, c, 40, f, 162, 163, some, desert, mammals, such, as, camels, use, dense, fur, to, prevent, solar, heat, from, reaching, their, skin, allowing, the, animal, to, stay, cool, a, camel, s, fur, may, reach, 70, c, 158, f, in, the, summer, but, the, skin, stays, at, 40, c, 104, f, 188, aquatic, mammals, conversely, trap, air, in, their, fur, to, conserve, heat, by, keeping, the, skin, dry, 162, 163, mammalian, coats, are, colored, for, a, variety, of, reasons, the, major, selective, pressures, including, camouflage, sexual, selection, communication, and, physiological, processes, such, as, temperature, regulation, camouflage, is, a, powerful, influence, in, many, mammals, as, it, helps, to, conceal, individuals, from, predators, or, prey, aposematism, warning, off, possible, predators, is, the, most, likely, explanation, of, the, black, and, white, pelage, of, many, mammals, which, are, able, to, defend, themselves, such, as, in, the, foul, smelling, skunk, and, the, powerful, and, aggressive, honey, badger, in, arctic, and, subarctic, mammals, such, as, the, arctic, fox, vulpes, lagopus, collared, lemming, dicrostonyx, groenlandicus, stoat, mustela, erminea, and, snowshoe, hare, lepus, americanus, seasonal, color, change, between, brown, in, summer, and, white, in, winter, is, driven, largely, by, camouflage, differences, in, female, and, male, coat, color, may, indicate, nutrition, and, hormone, levels, important, in, mate, selection, some, arboreal, mammals, notably, primates, and, marsupials, have, shades, of, violet, green, or, blue, skin, on, parts, of, their, bodies, indicating, some, distinct, advantage, in, their, largely, arboreal, habitat, due, to, convergent, evolution, the, green, coloration, of, sloths, however, is, the, result, of, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, algae, coat, color, is, sometimes, sexually, dimorphic, as, in, many, primate, species, coat, color, may, influence, the, ability, to, retain, heat, depending, on, how, much, light, is, reflected, mammals, with, darker, colored, coats, can, absorb, more, heat, from, solar, radiation, and, stay, warmer, some, smaller, mammals, such, as, voles, have, darker, fur, in, the, winter, the, white, pigmentless, fur, of, arctic, mammals, such, as, the, polar, bear, may, reflect, more, solar, radiation, directly, onto, the, skin, 166, 167, the, term, pelage, first, known, use, in, english, c, 1828, french, from, middle, french, from, poil, for, hair, from, old, french, peilss, from, latin, pilus, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, an, animal, s, complete, coat, the, term, fur, is, also, used, to, refer, to, animal, pelts, that, have, been, processed, into, leather, with, their, hair, still, attached, the, words, fur, or, furry, are, also, used, more, casually, to, refer, to, hair, like, growths, or, formations, particularly, when, the, subject, being, referred, to, exhibits, a, dense, coat, of, fine, soft, hairs, if, layered, rather, than, grown, as, a, single, coat, it, may, consist, of, short, down, hairs, long, guard, hairs, and, in, some, cases, medium, awn, hairs, mammals, with, reduced, amounts, of, fur, are, often, called, naked, as, with, the, naked, mole, rat, or, hairless, as, with, hairless, dogs, an, animal, with, commercially, valuable, fur, is, known, within, the, fur, industry, as, a, furbearer, the, use, of, fur, as, clothing, or, decoration, is, controversial, animal, welfare, advocates, object, to, the, trapping, and, killing, of, wildlife, and, the, confinement, and, killing, of, animals, on, fur, farms, the, modern, mammalian, fur, arrangement, is, known, to, have, occurred, as, far, back, as, docodonts, haramiyidans, and, eutriconodonts, with, specimens, of, castorocauda, megaconus, and, spinolestes, preserving, compound, follicles, with, both, guard, hair, and, underfur, fur, may, consist, of, three, layers, each, with, a, different, type, of, hair, down, hair, also, known, as, underfur, undercoat, underhair, or, ground, hair, is, the, bottom, or, inner, layer, composed, of, wavy, or, curly, hairs, with, no, straight, portions, or, sharp, points, down, hairs, which, are, also, flat, tend, to, be, the, shortest, and, most, numerous, in, the, coat, thermoregulation, is, the, principal, function, of, the, down, hair, which, insulates, a, layer, of, dry, air, next, to, the, skin, the, awn, hair, can, be, thought, of, as, a, hybrid, bridging, the, gap, between, the, distinctly, different, characteristics, of, down, and, guard, hairs, awn, hairs, begin, their, growth, much, like, guard, hairs, but, less, than, halfway, to, their, full, length, awn, hairs, start, to, grow, thin, and, wavy, like, down, hair, the, proximal, part, of, the, awn, hair, assists, in, thermoregulation, like, the, down, hair, whereas, the, distal, part, can, shed, water, like, the, guard, hair, the, awn, hair, s, thin, basal, portion, does, not, allow, the, amount, of, piloerection, that, the, stiffer, guard, hairs, are, capable, of, mammals, with, well, developed, down, and, guard, hairs, also, usually, have, large, numbers, of, awn, hairs, which, may, even, sometimes, be, the, bulk, of, the, visible, coat, guard, hair, overhair, is, the, top, or, outer, layer, of, the, coat, guard, hairs, are, longer, generally, coarser, and, have, nearly, straight, shafts, that, protrude, through, the, layer, of, softer, down, hair, the, distal, end, of, the, guard, hair, is, the, visible, layer, of, most, mammal, coats, this, layer, has, the, most, marked, pigmentation, and, gloss, manifesting, as, coat, markings, that, are, adapted, for, camouflage, or, display, guard, hair, repels, water, and, blocks, sunlight, protecting, the, undercoat, and, skin, in, wet, or, aquatic, habitats, and, from, the, sun, s, ultraviolet, radiation, guard, hairs, can, also, reduce, the, severity, of, cuts, or, scratches, to, the, skin, many, mammals, such, as, the, domestic, dog, and, cat, have, a, pilomotor, reflex, that, raises, their, guard, hairs, as, part, of, a, threat, display, when, agitated, hair, is, one, of, the, defining, characteristics, of, mammals, however, several, species, or, breeds, have, considerably, reduced, amounts, of, fur, these, are, often, called, naked, or, hairless, some, mammals, naturally, have, reduced, amounts, of, fur, some, semiaquatic, or, aquatic, mammals, such, as, cetaceans, pinnipeds, and, hippopotamuses, have, evolved, hairlessness, presumably, to, reduce, resistance, through, water, the, naked, mole, rat, has, evolved, hairlessness, perhaps, as, an, adaptation, to, their, subterranean, lifestyle, two, of, the, largest, extant, terrestrial, mammals, the, elephant, and, the, rhinoceros, are, largely, hairless, the, hairless, bat, is, mostly, hairless, but, does, have, short, bristly, hairs, around, its, neck, on, its, front, toes, and, around, the, throat, sac, along, with, fine, hairs, on, the, head, and, tail, membrane, most, hairless, animals, cannot, go, in, the, sun, for, long, periods, of, time, or, stay, in, the, cold, for, too, long, marsupials, are, born, hairless, and, grow, out, fur, later, in, development, humans, are, the, only, primate, species, that, have, undergone, significant, hair, loss, the, hairlessness, of, humans, compared, to, related, species, may, be, due, to, loss, of, functionality, in, the, pseudogene, krthap1, which, helps, produce, keratin, although, the, researchers, dated, the, mutation, to, 240, 000, ya, both, the, altai, neandertal, and, denisovan, peoples, possessed, the, loss, of, function, mutation, indicating, it, is, much, older, mutations, in, the, gene, hr, can, lead, to, complete, hair, loss, though, this, is, not, typical, in, humans, at, times, when, a, hairless, domesticated, animal, is, discovered, usually, owing, to, a, naturally, occurring, genetic, mutation, humans, may, intentionally, inbreed, those, hairless, individuals, and, after, multiple, generations, artificially, create, hairless, breeds, there, are, several, breeds, of, hairless, cats, perhaps, the, most, commonly, known, being, the, sphynx, cat, similarly, there, are, some, breeds, of, hairless, dogs, other, examples, of, artificially, selected, hairless, animals, include, the, hairless, guinea, pig, nude, mouse, and, the, hairless, rat, fur, has, long, served, as, a, source, of, clothing, for, humans, including, neanderthals, historically, it, was, worn, for, its, insulating, quality, with, aesthetics, becoming, a, factor, over, time, pelts, were, worn, in, or, out, depending, on, their, characteristics, and, desired, use, today, fur, and, trim, used, in, garments, may, be, dyed, bright, colors, or, to, mimic, exotic, animal, patterns, or, shorn, close, like, velvet, the, term, a, fur, may, connote, a, coat, wrap, or, shawl, the, manufacturing, of, fur, clothing, involves, obtaining, animal, pelts, where, the, hair, is, left, on, the, animal, s, processed, skin, in, contrast, making, leather, involves, removing, the, hair, from, the, hide, or, pelt, and, using, only, the, skin, fur, is, also, used, to, make, felt, a, common, felt, is, made, from, beaver, fur, and, is, used, in, bowler, hats, top, hats, and, high, end, cowboy, hats, common, furbearers, used, include, fox, rabbit, mink, muskrat, leopard, beaver, ermine, otter, sable, jaguar, seal, coyote, chinchilla, raccoon, lemur, and, possum, fur, bearing, animals, new, international, encyclopedia, 1905
