meningitis, is, acute, or, chronic, inflammation, of, the, protective, membranes, covering, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, collectively, called, the, meninges, the, most, common, symptoms, are, fever, intense, headache, vomiting, and, neck, stiffness, and, occasionally, photophobia, other, symptoms, include, confusion, or, altered, consciousness, nausea, and, an, inability, to, tolerate, light, or, loud, noises, young, children, often, exhibit, only, nonspecific, symptoms, such, as, irritability, drowsiness, or, poor, feeding, a, non, blanching, rash, a, rash, that, does, not, fade, when, a, glass, is, rolled, over, it, may, also, be, present, the, inflammation, may, be, caused, by, infection, with, viruses, bacteria, fungi, or, parasites, non, infectious, causes, include, malignancy, cancer, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, chronic, inflammatory, disease, sarcoidosis, and, certain, drugs, meningitis, can, be, life, threatening, because, of, the, inflammation, s, proximity, to, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, therefore, the, condition, is, classified, as, a, medical, emergency, a, lumbar, puncture, in, which, a, needle, is, inserted, into, the, spinal, canal, to, collect, a, sample, of, cerebrospinal, fluid, csf, can, diagnose, or, exclude, meningitis, some, forms, of, meningitis, are, preventable, by, immunization, with, the, meningococcal, mumps, pneumococcal, and, hib, vaccines, giving, antibiotics, to, people, with, significant, exposure, to, certain, types, of, meningitis, may, also, be, useful, the, first, treatment, in, acute, meningitis, consists, of, promptly, giving, antibiotics, and, sometimes, antiviral, drugs, corticosteroids, can, also, be, used, to, prevent, complications, from, excessive, inflammation, meningitis, can, lead, to, serious, long, term, consequences, such, as, deafness, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, or, cognitive, deficits, especially, if, not, treated, quickly, in, 2019, meningitis, was, diagnosed, in, about, 7, 7, million, people, worldwide, of, whom, 236, 000, died, down, from, 433, 000, deaths, in, 1990, with, appropriate, treatment, the, risk, of, death, in, bacterial, meningitis, is, less, than, 15, outbreaks, of, bacterial, meningitis, occur, between, december, and, june, each, year, in, an, area, of, sub, saharan, africa, known, as, the, meningitis, belt, smaller, outbreaks, may, also, occur, in, other, areas, of, the, world, the, word, meningitis, comes, from, the, greek, meninx, membrane, and, the, medical, suffix, itis, inflammation, in, adults, the, most, common, symptom, of, meningitis, is, a, severe, headache, occurring, in, almost, 90, of, cases, of, bacterial, meningitis, followed, by, neck, stiffness, the, inability, to, flex, the, neck, forward, passively, due, to, increased, neck, muscle, tone, and, stiffness, the, classic, triad, of, diagnostic, signs, consists, of, neck, stiffness, sudden, high, fever, and, altered, mental, status, however, all, three, features, are, present, in, only, 44, 46, of, bacterial, meningitis, cases, if, none, of, the, three, signs, are, present, acute, meningitis, is, extremely, unlikely, other, signs, commonly, associated, with, meningitis, include, photophobia, intolerance, to, bright, light, and, phonophobia, intolerance, to, loud, noises, small, children, often, do, not, exhibit, the, aforementioned, symptoms, and, may, only, be, irritable, and, look, unwell, the, fontanelle, the, soft, spot, on, the, top, of, a, baby, s, head, can, bulge, in, infants, aged, up, to, 6, months, other, features, that, distinguish, meningitis, from, less, severe, illnesses, in, young, children, are, leg, pain, cold, extremities, and, an, abnormal, skin, color, neck, stiffness, occurs, in, 70, of, bacterial, meningitis, in, adults, other, signs, include, the, presence, of, positive, kernig, s, sign, or, brudzi, ski, sign, kernig, s, sign, is, assessed, with, the, person, lying, supine, with, the, hip, and, knee, flexed, to, 90, degrees, in, a, person, with, a, positive, kernig, s, sign, pain, limits, passive, extension, of, the, knee, a, positive, brudzinski, s, sign, occurs, when, flexion, of, the, neck, causes, involuntary, flexion, of, the, knee, and, hip, although, kernig, s, sign, and, brudzinski, s, sign, are, both, commonly, used, to, screen, for, meningitis, the, sensitivity, of, these, tests, is, limited, they, do, however, have, very, good, specificity, for, meningitis, the, signs, rarely, occur, in, other, diseases, another, test, known, as, the, jolt, accentuation, maneuver, helps, determine, whether, meningitis, is, present, in, those, reporting, fever, and, headache, a, person, is, asked, to, rapidly, rotate, the, head, horizontally, if, this, does, not, make, the, headache, worse, meningitis, is, unlikely, other, problems, can, produce, symptoms, similar, to, those, above, but, from, non, meningitic, causes, this, is, called, meningism, or, pseudomeningitis, meningitis, caused, by, the, bacterium, neisseria, meningitidis, known, as, meningococcal, meningitis, can, be, differentiated, from, meningitis, with, other, causes, by, a, rapidly, spreading, petechial, rash, which, may, precede, other, symptoms, the, rash, consists, of, numerous, small, irregular, purple, or, red, spots, petechiae, on, the, trunk, lower, extremities, mucous, membranes, conjunctiva, and, occasionally, the, palms, of, the, hands, or, soles, of, the, feet, the, rash, is, typically, non, blanching, the, redness, does, not, disappear, when, pressed, with, a, finger, or, a, glass, tumbler, although, this, rash, is, not, necessarily, present, in, meningococcal, meningitis, it, is, relatively, specific, for, the, disease, it, does, however, occasionally, occur, in, meningitis, due, to, other, bacteria, other, clues, on, the, cause, of, meningitis, may, be, the, skin, signs, of, hand, foot, and, mouth, disease, and, genital, herpes, both, of, which, are, associated, with, various, forms, of, viral, meningitis, additional, problems, may, occur, in, the, early, stage, of, the, illness, these, may, require, specific, treatment, and, sometimes, indicate, severe, illness, or, worse, prognosis, the, infection, may, trigger, sepsis, a, systemic, inflammatory, response, syndrome, of, falling, blood, pressure, fast, heart, rate, high, or, abnormally, low, temperature, and, rapid, breathing, very, low, blood, pressure, may, occur, at, an, early, stage, especially, but, not, exclusively, in, meningococcal, meningitis, this, may, lead, to, insufficient, blood, supply, to, other, organs, disseminated, intravascular, coagulation, the, excessive, activation, of, blood, clotting, may, obstruct, blood, flow, to, organs, and, paradoxically, increase, the, bleeding, risk, gangrene, of, limbs, can, occur, in, meningococcal, disease, severe, meningococcal, and, pneumococcal, infections, may, result, in, hemorrhaging, of, the, adrenal, glands, leading, to, waterhouse, friderichsen, syndrome, which, is, often, fatal, the, brain, tissue, may, swell, pressure, inside, the, skull, may, increase, and, the, swollen, brain, may, herniate, through, the, skull, base, this, may, be, noticed, by, a, decreasing, level, of, consciousness, loss, of, the, pupillary, light, reflex, and, abnormal, posturing, the, inflammation, of, the, brain, tissue, may, also, obstruct, the, normal, flow, of, csf, around, the, brain, hydrocephalus, seizures, may, occur, for, various, reasons, in, children, seizures, are, common, in, the, early, stages, of, meningitis, in, 30, of, cases, and, do, not, necessarily, indicate, an, underlying, cause, seizures, may, result, from, increased, pressure, and, from, areas, of, inflammation, in, the, brain, tissue, focal, seizures, seizures, that, involve, one, limb, or, part, of, the, body, persistent, seizures, late, onset, seizures, and, those, that, are, difficult, to, control, with, medication, indicate, a, poorer, long, term, outcome, inflammation, of, the, meninges, may, lead, to, abnormalities, of, the, cranial, nerves, a, group, of, nerves, arising, from, the, brain, stem, that, supply, the, head, and, neck, area, and, which, control, among, other, functions, eye, movement, facial, muscles, and, hearing, visual, symptoms, and, hearing, loss, may, persist, after, an, episode, of, meningitis, inflammation, of, the, brain, encephalitis, or, its, blood, vessels, cerebral, vasculitis, as, well, as, the, formation, of, blood, clots, in, the, veins, cerebral, venous, thrombosis, may, all, lead, to, weakness, loss, of, sensation, or, abnormal, movement, or, function, of, the, part, of, the, body, supplied, by, the, affected, area, of, the, brain, meningitis, is, typically, caused, by, an, infection, most, infections, are, due, to, viruses, and, others, due, to, bacteria, fungi, and, parasites, mostly, the, parasites, are, parasitic, worms, but, can, also, rarely, include, parasitic, amoebae, meningitis, may, also, result, from, various, non, infectious, causes, the, term, aseptic, meningitis, refers, to, cases, of, meningitis, in, which, no, bacterial, infection, can, be, demonstrated, this, type, of, meningitis, is, usually, caused, by, viruses, but, it, may, be, due, to, bacterial, infection, that, has, already, been, partially, treated, when, bacteria, disappear, from, the, meninges, or, when, pathogens, infect, a, space, adjacent, to, the, meninges, such, as, sinusitis, endocarditis, an, infection, of, the, heart, valves, which, spreads, small, clusters, of, bacteria, through, the, bloodstream, may, cause, aseptic, meningitis, aseptic, meningitis, may, also, result, from, infection, with, spirochetes, a, group, of, bacteria, that, includes, treponema, pallidum, the, cause, of, syphilis, and, borrelia, burgdorferi, known, for, causing, lyme, disease, and, may, also, result, from, cerebral, malaria, malaria, infecting, the, brain, the, types, of, bacteria, that, cause, bacterial, meningitis, vary, according, to, the, infected, individual, s, age, group, a, head, injury, potentially, allows, nasal, cavity, bacteria, to, enter, the, meningeal, space, similarly, devices, in, the, brain, and, meninges, such, as, cerebral, shunts, extraventricular, drains, or, ommaya, reservoirs, carry, an, increased, risk, of, meningitis, in, these, cases, people, are, more, likely, to, be, infected, with, staphylococci, pseudomonas, and, other, gram, negative, bacteria, these, pathogens, are, also, associated, with, meningitis, in, people, with, an, impaired, immune, system, an, infection, in, the, head, and, neck, area, such, as, otitis, media, or, mastoiditis, can, lead, to, meningitis, in, a, small, proportion, of, people, recipients, of, cochlear, implants, for, hearing, loss, are, more, at, risk, for, pneumococcal, meningitis, in, rare, cases, enterococcus, spp, can, be, responsible, for, meningitis, both, community, and, hospital, acquired, usually, as, a, secondary, result, of, trauma, or, surgery, or, due, to, intestinal, diseases, e, g, strongyloidiasis, tuberculous, meningitis, which, is, meningitis, caused, by, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, is, more, common, in, people, from, countries, in, which, tuberculosis, is, endemic, but, is, also, encountered, in, people, with, immune, problems, such, as, aids, recurrent, bacterial, meningitis, may, be, caused, by, persisting, anatomical, defects, either, congenital, or, acquired, or, by, disorders, of, the, immune, system, anatomical, defects, allow, continuity, between, the, external, environment, and, the, nervous, system, the, most, common, cause, of, recurrent, meningitis, is, a, skull, fracture, particularly, fractures, that, affect, the, base, of, the, skull, or, extend, towards, the, sinuses, and, petrous, pyramids, approximately, 59, of, recurrent, meningitis, cases, are, due, to, such, anatomical, abnormalities, 36, are, due, to, immune, deficiencies, such, as, complement, deficiency, which, predisposes, especially, to, recurrent, meningococcal, meningitis, and, 5, are, due, to, ongoing, infections, in, areas, adjacent, to, the, meninges, viruses, that, cause, meningitis, include, enteroviruses, herpes, simplex, virus, generally, type, 2, which, produces, most, genital, sores, less, commonly, type, 1, varicella, zoster, virus, known, for, causing, chickenpox, and, shingles, mumps, virus, hiv, lcmv, arboviruses, acquired, from, a, mosquito, or, other, insect, and, the, influenza, virus, mollaret, s, meningitis, is, a, chronic, recurrent, form, of, herpes, meningitis, it, is, thought, to, be, caused, by, herpes, simplex, virus, type, 2, there, are, a, number, of, risk, factors, for, fungal, meningitis, including, the, use, of, immunosuppressants, such, as, after, organ, transplantation, hiv, aids, and, the, loss, of, immunity, associated, with, aging, it, is, uncommon, in, those, with, a, normal, immune, system, but, has, occurred, with, medication, contamination, symptom, onset, is, typically, more, gradual, with, headaches, and, fever, being, present, for, at, least, a, couple, of, weeks, before, diagnosis, the, most, common, fungal, meningitis, is, cryptococcal, meningitis, due, to, cryptococcus, neoformans, in, africa, cryptococcal, meningitis, is, now, the, most, common, cause, of, meningitis, in, multiple, studies, and, it, accounts, for, 20, 25, of, aids, related, deaths, in, africa, other, less, common, pathogenic, fungi, which, can, cause, meningitis, include, coccidioides, immitis, histoplasma, capsulatum, blastomyces, dermatitidis, and, candida, species, a, parasitic, worm, is, often, assumed, to, be, the, cause, of, eosinophilic, meningitis, when, there, is, a, predominance, of, eosinophils, a, type, of, white, blood, cell, found, in, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, the, most, common, parasites, implicated, are, angiostrongylus, cantonensis, gnathostoma, spinigerum, schistosoma, as, well, as, the, conditions, cysticercosis, toxocariasis, baylisascariasis, paragonimiasis, and, a, number, of, rarer, infections, and, noninfective, conditions, rarely, free, living, parasitic, amoebae, can, cause, naegleriasis, also, called, amebic, meningitis, a, type, of, meningoencephalitis, where, not, only, the, meninges, are, affected, but, also, the, brain, tissue, meningitis, may, occur, as, the, result, of, several, non, infectious, causes, spread, of, cancer, to, the, meninges, malignant, or, neoplastic, meningitis, and, certain, drugs, mainly, non, steroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, antibiotics, and, intravenous, immunoglobulins, it, may, also, be, caused, by, several, inflammatory, conditions, such, as, sarcoidosis, which, is, then, called, neurosarcoidosis, connective, tissue, disorders, such, as, systemic, lupus, erythematosus, and, certain, forms, of, vasculitis, inflammatory, conditions, of, the, blood, vessel, wall, such, as, beh, et, s, disease, epidermoid, cysts, and, dermoid, cysts, may, cause, meningitis, by, releasing, irritant, matter, into, the, subarachnoid, space, rarely, migraine, may, cause, meningitis, but, this, diagnosis, is, usually, only, made, when, other, causes, have, been, eliminated, the, meninges, comprise, three, membranes, that, together, with, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, enclose, and, protect, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, the, central, nervous, system, the, pia, mater, is, a, delicate, impermeable, membrane, that, firmly, adheres, to, the, surface, of, the, brain, following, all, the, minor, contours, the, arachnoid, mater, so, named, because, of, its, spider, web, like, appearance, is, a, loosely, fitting, sac, on, top, of, the, pia, mater, the, subarachnoid, space, separates, the, arachnoid, and, pia, mater, membranes, and, is, filled, with, cerebrospinal, fluid, the, outermost, membrane, the, dura, mater, is, a, thick, durable, membrane, which, is, attached, to, both, the, arachnoid, membrane, and, the, skull, in, bacterial, meningitis, bacteria, reach, the, meninges, by, one, of, two, main, routes, through, the, bloodstream, hematogenous, spread, or, through, direct, contact, between, the, meninges, and, either, the, nasal, cavity, or, the, skin, in, most, cases, meningitis, follows, invasion, of, the, bloodstream, by, organisms, that, live, on, mucosal, surfaces, such, as, the, nasal, cavity, this, is, often, in, turn, preceded, by, viral, infections, which, break, down, the, normal, barrier, provided, by, the, mucosal, surfaces, once, bacteria, have, entered, the, bloodstream, they, enter, the, subarachnoid, space, in, places, where, the, blood, brain, barrier, is, vulnerable, such, as, the, choroid, plexus, meningitis, occurs, in, 25, of, newborns, with, bloodstream, infections, due, to, group, b, streptococci, this, phenomenon, is, much, less, common, in, adults, direct, contamination, of, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, may, arise, from, indwelling, devices, skull, fractures, or, infections, of, the, nasopharynx, or, the, nasal, sinuses, that, have, formed, a, tract, with, the, subarachnoid, space, see, above, occasionally, congenital, defects, of, the, dura, mater, can, be, identified, the, large, scale, inflammation, that, occurs, in, the, subarachnoid, space, during, meningitis, is, not, a, direct, result, of, bacterial, infection, but, can, rather, largely, be, attributed, to, the, response, of, the, immune, system, to, the, entry, of, bacteria, into, the, central, nervous, system, when, components, of, the, bacterial, cell, membrane, are, identified, by, the, immune, cells, of, the, brain, astrocytes, and, microglia, they, respond, by, releasing, large, amounts, of, cytokines, hormone, like, mediators, that, recruit, other, immune, cells, and, stimulate, other, tissues, to, participate, in, an, immune, response, the, blood, brain, barrier, becomes, more, permeable, leading, to, vasogenic, cerebral, edema, swelling, of, the, brain, due, to, fluid, leakage, from, blood, vessels, large, numbers, of, white, blood, cells, enter, the, csf, causing, inflammation, of, the, meninges, and, leading, to, interstitial, edema, swelling, due, to, fluid, between, the, cells, in, addition, the, walls, of, the, blood, vessels, themselves, become, inflamed, cerebral, vasculitis, which, leads, to, decreased, blood, flow, and, a, third, type, of, edema, cytotoxic, edema, the, three, forms, of, cerebral, edema, all, lead, to, increased, intracranial, pressure, together, with, the, lowered, blood, pressure, often, encountered, in, sepsis, this, means, that, it, is, harder, for, blood, to, enter, the, brain, consequently, brain, cells, are, deprived, of, oxygen, and, undergo, apoptosis, programmed, cell, death, administration, of, antibiotics, may, initially, worsen, the, process, outlined, above, by, increasing, the, amount, of, bacterial, cell, membrane, products, released, through, the, destruction, of, bacteria, particular, treatments, such, as, the, use, of, corticosteroids, are, aimed, at, dampening, the, immune, system, s, response, to, this, phenomenon, diagnosing, meningitis, as, promptly, as, possible, can, improve, outcomes, there, are, no, specific, signs, or, symptoms, that, can, indicate, meningitis, and, a, lumbar, puncture, spinal, tap, to, examine, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, is, recommended, for, diagnosis, lumbar, puncture, is, contraindicated, if, there, is, a, mass, in, the, brain, tumor, or, abscess, or, the, intracranial, pressure, icp, is, elevated, as, it, may, lead, to, brain, herniation, if, someone, is, at, risk, for, either, a, mass, or, raised, icp, recent, head, injury, a, known, immune, system, problem, localizing, neurological, signs, or, evidence, on, examination, of, a, raised, icp, a, ct, or, mri, scan, is, recommended, prior, to, the, lumbar, puncture, this, applies, in, 45, of, all, adult, cases, there, are, no, physical, tests, that, can, rule, out, or, determine, if, a, person, has, meningitis, the, jolt, accentuation, test, is, not, specific, or, sensitive, enough, to, completely, rule, out, meningitis, if, someone, is, suspected, of, having, meningitis, blood, tests, are, performed, for, markers, of, inflammation, e, g, c, reactive, protein, complete, blood, count, as, well, as, blood, cultures, if, a, ct, or, mri, is, required, before, lp, or, if, lp, proves, difficult, professional, guidelines, suggest, that, antibiotics, should, be, administered, first, to, prevent, delay, in, treatment, especially, if, this, may, be, longer, than, 30, minutes, often, ct, or, mri, scans, are, performed, at, a, later, stage, to, assess, for, complications, of, meningitis, in, severe, forms, of, meningitis, monitoring, of, blood, electrolytes, may, be, important, for, example, hyponatremia, is, common, in, bacterial, meningitis, the, cause, of, hyponatremia, however, is, controversial, and, may, include, dehydration, the, inappropriate, secretion, of, the, antidiuretic, hormone, siadh, or, overly, aggressive, intravenous, fluid, administration, a, lumbar, puncture, is, done, by, positioning, the, person, usually, lying, on, the, side, applying, local, anesthetic, and, inserting, a, needle, into, the, dural, sac, a, sac, around, the, spinal, cord, to, collect, cerebrospinal, fluid, csf, when, this, has, been, achieved, the, opening, pressure, of, the, csf, is, measured, using, a, manometer, the, pressure, is, normally, between, 6, and, 18, cm, water, cmh, 2, o, in, bacterial, meningitis, the, pressure, is, usually, elevated, in, cryptococcal, meningitis, intracranial, pressure, is, markedly, elevated, the, initial, appearance, of, the, fluid, may, prove, an, indication, of, the, nature, of, the, infection, cloudy, csf, indicates, higher, levels, of, protein, white, and, red, blood, cells, and, or, bacteria, and, therefore, may, suggest, bacterial, meningitis, the, csf, sample, is, examined, for, presence, and, types, of, white, blood, cells, red, blood, cells, protein, content, and, glucose, level, gram, staining, of, the, sample, may, demonstrate, bacteria, in, bacterial, meningitis, but, absence, of, bacteria, does, not, exclude, bacterial, meningitis, as, they, are, only, seen, in, 60, of, cases, this, figure, is, reduced, by, a, further, 20, if, antibiotics, were, administered, before, the, sample, was, taken, gram, staining, is, also, less, reliable, in, particular, infections, such, as, listeriosis, microbiological, culture, of, the, sample, is, more, sensitive, it, identifies, the, organism, in, 70, 85, of, cases, but, results, can, take, up, to, 48, hours, to, become, available, the, type, of, white, blood, cell, predominantly, present, see, table, indicates, whether, meningitis, is, bacterial, usually, neutrophil, predominant, or, viral, usually, lymphocyte, predominant, although, at, the, beginning, of, the, disease, this, is, not, always, a, reliable, indicator, less, commonly, eosinophils, predominate, suggesting, parasitic, or, fungal, etiology, among, others, the, concentration, of, glucose, in, csf, is, normally, above, 40, of, that, in, blood, in, bacterial, meningitis, it, is, typically, lower, the, csf, glucose, level, is, therefore, divided, by, the, blood, glucose, csf, glucose, to, serum, glucose, ratio, a, ratio, 0, 4, is, indicative, of, bacterial, meningitis, in, the, newborn, glucose, levels, in, csf, are, normally, higher, and, a, ratio, below, 0, 6, 60, is, therefore, considered, abnormal, high, levels, of, lactate, in, csf, indicate, a, higher, likelihood, of, bacterial, meningitis, as, does, a, higher, white, blood, cell, count, if, lactate, levels, are, less, than, 35, mg, dl, and, the, person, has, not, previously, received, antibiotics, then, this, may, rule, out, bacterial, meningitis, various, other, specialized, tests, may, be, used, to, distinguish, between, different, types, of, meningitis, a, latex, agglutination, test, may, be, positive, in, meningitis, caused, by, streptococcus, pneumoniae, neisseria, meningitidis, haemophilus, influenzae, escherichia, coli, and, group, b, streptococci, its, routine, use, is, not, encouraged, as, it, rarely, leads, to, changes, in, treatment, but, it, may, be, used, if, other, tests, are, not, diagnostic, similarly, the, limulus, lysate, test, may, be, positive, in, meningitis, caused, by, gram, negative, bacteria, but, it, is, of, limited, use, unless, other, tests, have, been, unhelpful, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, is, a, technique, used, to, amplify, small, traces, of, bacterial, dna, in, order, to, detect, the, presence, of, bacterial, or, viral, dna, in, cerebrospinal, fluid, it, is, a, highly, sensitive, and, specific, test, since, only, trace, amounts, of, the, infecting, agent, s, dna, is, required, it, may, identify, bacteria, in, bacterial, meningitis, and, may, assist, in, distinguishing, the, various, causes, of, viral, meningitis, enterovirus, herpes, simplex, virus, 2, and, mumps, in, those, not, vaccinated, for, this, serology, identification, of, antibodies, to, viruses, may, be, useful, in, viral, meningitis, if, tuberculous, meningitis, is, suspected, the, sample, is, processed, for, ziehl, neelsen, stain, which, has, a, low, sensitivity, and, tuberculosis, culture, which, takes, a, long, time, to, process, pcr, is, being, used, increasingly, diagnosis, of, cryptococcal, meningitis, can, be, made, at, low, cost, using, an, india, ink, stain, of, the, csf, however, testing, for, cryptococcal, antigen, in, blood, or, csf, is, more, sensitive, a, diagnostic, and, therapeutic, difficulty, is, partially, treated, meningitis, where, there, are, meningitis, symptoms, after, receiving, antibiotics, such, as, for, presumptive, sinusitis, when, this, happens, csf, findings, may, resemble, those, of, viral, meningitis, but, antibiotic, treatment, may, need, to, be, continued, until, there, is, definitive, positive, evidence, of, a, viral, cause, e, g, a, positive, enterovirus, pcr, meningitis, can, be, diagnosed, after, death, has, occurred, the, findings, from, a, post, mortem, are, usually, a, widespread, inflammation, of, the, pia, mater, and, arachnoid, layers, of, the, meninges, neutrophil, granulocytes, tend, to, have, migrated, to, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, and, the, base, of, the, brain, along, with, cranial, nerves, and, the, spinal, cord, may, be, surrounded, with, pus, as, may, the, meningeal, vessels, for, some, causes, of, meningitis, protection, can, be, provided, in, the, long, term, through, vaccination, or, in, the, short, term, with, antibiotics, some, behavioral, measures, may, also, be, effective, bacterial, and, viral, meningitis, are, contagious, but, neither, is, as, contagious, as, the, common, cold, or, flu, both, can, be, transmitted, through, droplets, of, respiratory, secretions, during, close, contact, such, as, kissing, sneezing, or, coughing, on, someone, but, bacterial, meningitis, cannot, be, spread, by, only, breathing, the, air, where, a, person, with, meningitis, has, been, viral, meningitis, is, typically, caused, by, enteroviruses, and, is, most, commonly, spread, through, fecal, contamination, the, risk, of, infection, can, be, decreased, by, changing, the, behavior, that, led, to, transmission, since, the, 1980s, many, countries, have, included, immunization, against, haemophilus, influenzae, type, b, in, their, routine, childhood, vaccination, schemes, this, has, practically, eliminated, this, pathogen, as, a, cause, of, meningitis, in, young, children, in, those, countries, in, the, countries, in, which, the, disease, burden, is, highest, however, the, vaccine, is, still, too, expensive, similarly, immunization, against, mumps, has, led, to, a, sharp, fall, in, the, number, of, cases, of, mumps, meningitis, which, prior, to, vaccination, occurred, in, 15, of, all, cases, of, mumps, meningococcus, vaccines, exist, against, groups, a, b, c, w135, and, y, in, countries, where, the, vaccine, for, meningococcus, group, c, was, introduced, cases, caused, by, this, pathogen, have, decreased, substantially, a, quadrivalent, vaccine, now, exists, which, combines, four, vaccines, with, the, exception, of, b, immunization, with, this, acw135y, vaccine, is, now, a, visa, requirement, for, taking, part, in, hajj, development, of, a, vaccine, against, group, b, meningococci, has, proved, much, more, difficult, as, its, surface, proteins, which, would, normally, be, used, to, make, a, vaccine, only, elicit, a, weak, response, from, the, immune, system, or, cross, react, with, normal, human, proteins, still, some, countries, new, zealand, cuba, norway, and, chile, have, developed, vaccines, against, local, strains, of, group, b, meningococci, some, have, shown, good, results, and, are, used, in, local, immunization, schedules, two, new, vaccines, both, approved, in, 2014, are, effective, against, a, wider, range, of, group, b, meningococci, strains, in, africa, until, recently, the, approach, for, prevention, and, control, of, meningococcal, epidemics, was, based, on, early, detection, of, the, disease, and, emergency, reactive, mass, vaccination, of, the, population, at, risk, with, bivalent, a, c, or, trivalent, a, c, w135, polysaccharide, vaccines, though, the, introduction, of, menafrivac, meningococcus, group, a, vaccine, has, demonstrated, effectiveness, in, young, people, and, has, been, described, as, a, model, for, product, development, partnerships, in, resource, limited, settings, routine, vaccination, against, streptococcus, pneumoniae, with, the, pneumococcal, conjugate, vaccine, pcv, which, is, active, against, seven, common, serotypes, of, this, pathogen, significantly, reduces, the, incidence, of, pneumococcal, meningitis, the, pneumococcal, polysaccharide, vaccine, which, covers, 23, strains, is, only, administered, to, certain, groups, e, g, those, who, have, had, a, splenectomy, the, surgical, removal, of, the, spleen, it, does, not, elicit, a, significant, immune, response, in, all, recipients, e, g, small, children, childhood, vaccination, with, bacillus, calmette, gu, rin, has, been, reported, to, significantly, reduce, the, rate, of, tuberculous, meningitis, but, its, waning, effectiveness, in, adulthood, has, prompted, a, search, for, a, better, vaccine, short, term, antibiotic, prophylaxis, is, another, method, of, prevention, particularly, of, meningococcal, meningitis, in, cases, of, meningococcal, meningitis, preventative, treatment, in, close, contacts, with, antibiotics, e, g, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, or, ceftriaxone, can, reduce, their, risk, of, contracting, the, condition, but, does, not, protect, against, future, infections, resistance, to, rifampicin, has, been, noted, to, increase, after, use, which, has, caused, some, to, recommend, considering, other, agents, while, antibiotics, are, frequently, used, in, an, attempt, to, prevent, meningitis, in, those, with, a, basilar, skull, fracture, there, is, not, enough, evidence, to, determine, whether, this, is, beneficial, or, harmful, this, applies, to, those, with, or, without, a, csf, leak, meningitis, is, potentially, life, threatening, and, has, a, high, mortality, rate, if, untreated, delay, in, treatment, has, been, associated, with, a, poorer, outcome, thus, treatment, with, wide, spectrum, antibiotics, should, not, be, delayed, while, confirmatory, tests, are, being, conducted, if, meningococcal, disease, is, suspected, in, primary, care, guidelines, recommend, that, benzylpenicillin, be, administered, before, transfer, to, hospital, intravenous, fluids, should, be, administered, if, hypotension, low, blood, pressure, or, shock, are, present, it, is, not, clear, whether, intravenous, fluid, should, be, given, routinely, or, whether, this, should, be, restricted, given, that, meningitis, can, cause, a, number, of, early, severe, complications, regular, medical, review, is, recommended, to, identify, these, complications, early, and, to, admit, the, person, to, an, intensive, care, unit, if, deemed, necessary, mechanical, ventilation, may, be, needed, if, the, level, of, consciousness, is, very, low, or, if, there, is, evidence, of, respiratory, failure, if, there, are, signs, of, raised, intracranial, pressure, measures, to, monitor, the, pressure, may, be, taken, this, would, allow, the, optimization, of, the, cerebral, perfusion, pressure, and, various, treatments, to, decrease, the, intracranial, pressure, with, medication, e, g, mannitol, seizures, are, treated, with, anticonvulsants, hydrocephalus, obstructed, flow, of, csf, may, require, insertion, of, a, temporary, or, long, term, drainage, device, such, as, a, cerebral, shunt, the, osmotic, therapy, glycerol, has, an, unclear, effect, on, mortality, but, may, decrease, hearing, problems, empiric, antibiotics, treatment, without, exact, diagnosis, should, be, started, immediately, even, before, the, results, of, the, lumbar, puncture, and, csf, analysis, are, known, the, choice, of, initial, treatment, depends, largely, on, the, kind, of, bacteria, that, cause, meningitis, in, a, particular, place, and, population, for, instance, in, the, united, kingdom, empirical, treatment, consists, of, a, third, generation, cefalosporin, such, as, cefotaxime, or, ceftriaxone, in, the, us, where, resistance, to, cefalosporins, is, increasingly, found, in, streptococci, addition, of, vancomycin, to, the, initial, treatment, is, recommended, chloramphenicol, either, alone, or, in, combination, with, ampicillin, however, appears, to, work, equally, well, empirical, therapy, may, be, chosen, on, the, basis, of, the, person, s, age, whether, the, infection, was, preceded, by, a, head, injury, whether, the, person, has, undergone, recent, neurosurgery, and, whether, or, not, a, cerebral, shunt, is, present, in, young, children, and, those, over, 50, years, of, age, as, well, as, those, who, are, immunocompromised, the, addition, of, ampicillin, is, recommended, to, cover, listeria, monocytogenes, once, the, gram, stain, results, become, available, and, the, broad, type, of, bacterial, cause, is, known, it, may, be, possible, to, change, the, antibiotics, to, those, likely, to, deal, with, the, presumed, group, of, pathogens, the, results, of, the, csf, culture, generally, take, longer, to, become, available, 24, 48, hours, once, they, do, empiric, therapy, may, be, switched, to, specific, antibiotic, therapy, targeted, to, the, specific, causative, organism, and, its, sensitivities, to, antibiotics, for, an, antibiotic, to, be, effective, in, meningitis, it, must, not, only, be, active, against, the, pathogenic, bacterium, but, also, reach, the, meninges, in, adequate, quantities, some, antibiotics, have, inadequate, penetrance, and, therefore, have, little, use, in, meningitis, most, of, the, antibiotics, used, in, meningitis, have, not, been, tested, directly, on, people, with, meningitis, in, clinical, trials, rather, the, relevant, knowledge, has, mostly, derived, from, laboratory, studies, in, rabbits, tuberculous, meningitis, requires, prolonged, treatment, with, antibiotics, while, tuberculosis, of, the, lungs, is, typically, treated, for, six, months, those, with, tuberculous, meningitis, are, typically, treated, for, a, year, or, longer, fluid, given, intravenously, are, an, essential, part, of, treatment, of, bacterial, meningitis, there, is, no, difference, in, terms, of, mortality, or, acute, severe, neurological, complications, in, children, given, a, maintenance, regimen, over, restricted, fluid, regimen, but, evidence, is, in, favor, of, the, maintenance, regimen, in, terms, of, emergence, of, chronic, severe, neurological, complications, additional, treatment, with, corticosteroids, usually, dexamethasone, has, shown, some, benefits, such, as, a, reduction, of, hearing, loss, and, better, short, term, neurological, outcomes, in, adolescents, and, adults, from, high, income, countries, with, low, rates, of, hiv, some, research, has, found, reduced, rates, of, death, while, other, research, has, not, they, also, appear, to, be, beneficial, in, those, with, tuberculosis, meningitis, at, least, in, those, who, are, hiv, negative, professional, guidelines, therefore, recommend, the, commencement, of, dexamethasone, or, a, similar, corticosteroid, just, before, the, first, dose, of, antibiotics, is, given, and, continued, for, four, days, given, that, most, of, the, benefit, of, the, treatment, is, confined, to, those, with, pneumococcal, meningitis, some, guidelines, suggest, that, dexamethasone, be, discontinued, if, another, cause, for, meningitis, is, identified, the, likely, mechanism, is, suppression, of, overactive, inflammation, additional, treatment, with, corticosteroids, have, a, different, role, in, children, than, in, adults, though, the, benefit, of, corticosteroids, has, been, demonstrated, in, adults, as, well, as, in, children, from, high, income, countries, their, use, in, children, from, low, income, countries, is, not, supported, by, the, evidence, the, reason, for, this, discrepancy, is, not, clear, even, in, high, income, countries, the, benefit, of, corticosteroids, is, only, seen, when, they, are, given, prior, to, the, first, dose, of, antibiotics, and, is, greatest, in, cases, of, h, influenzae, meningitis, the, incidence, of, which, has, decreased, dramatically, since, the, introduction, of, the, hib, vaccine, thus, corticosteroids, are, recommended, in, the, treatment, of, pediatric, meningitis, if, the, cause, is, h, influenzae, and, only, if, given, prior, to, the, first, dose, of, antibiotics, other, uses, are, controversial, in, addition, to, the, primary, therapy, of, antibiotics, and, corticosteroids, other, adjuvant, therapies, are, under, development, or, are, sometimes, used, to, try, and, improve, survival, from, bacterial, meningitis, and, reduce, the, risk, of, neurological, problems, examples, of, adjuvant, therapies, that, have, been, trialed, include, acetaminophen, immunoglobulin, therapy, heparin, pentoxifyline, and, a, mononucleotide, mixture, with, succinic, acid, it, is, not, clear, if, any, of, these, therapies, are, helpful, or, worsen, outcomes, in, people, with, acute, bacterial, meningitis, viral, meningitis, typically, only, requires, supportive, therapy, most, viruses, responsible, for, causing, meningitis, are, not, amenable, to, specific, treatment, viral, meningitis, tends, to, run, a, more, benign, course, than, bacterial, meningitis, herpes, simplex, virus, and, varicella, zoster, virus, may, respond, to, treatment, with, antiviral, drugs, such, as, aciclovir, but, there, are, no, clinical, trials, that, have, specifically, addressed, whether, this, treatment, is, effective, mild, cases, of, viral, meningitis, can, be, treated, at, home, with, conservative, measures, such, as, fluid, bedrest, and, analgesics, fungal, meningitis, such, as, cryptococcal, meningitis, is, treated, with, long, courses, of, high, dose, antifungals, such, as, amphotericin, b, and, flucytosine, raised, intracranial, pressure, is, common, in, fungal, meningitis, and, frequent, ideally, daily, lumbar, punctures, to, relieve, the, pressure, are, recommended, or, alternatively, a, lumbar, drain, untreated, bacterial, meningitis, is, almost, always, fatal, according, to, the, who, bacterial, meningitis, has, an, overall, mortality, rate, of, 16, 7, with, treatment, viral, meningitis, in, contrast, tends, to, resolve, spontaneously, and, is, rarely, fatal, with, treatment, mortality, risk, of, death, from, bacterial, meningitis, depends, on, the, age, of, the, person, and, the, underlying, cause, of, newborns, 20, 30, may, die, from, an, episode, of, bacterial, meningitis, this, risk, is, much, lower, in, older, children, whose, mortality, is, about, 2, but, rises, again, to, about, 19, 37, in, adults, risk, of, death, is, predicted, by, various, factors, apart, from, age, such, as, the, pathogen, and, the, time, it, takes, for, the, pathogen, to, be, cleared, from, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, the, severity, of, the, generalized, illness, a, decreased, level, of, consciousness, or, an, abnormally, low, count, of, white, blood, cells, in, the, csf, meningitis, caused, by, h, influenzae, and, meningococci, has, a, better, prognosis, than, cases, caused, by, group, b, streptococci, coliforms, and, s, pneumoniae, in, adults, too, meningococcal, meningitis, has, a, lower, mortality, 3, 7, than, pneumococcal, disease, in, children, there, are, several, potential, disabilities, which, may, result, from, damage, to, the, nervous, system, including, sensorineural, hearing, loss, epilepsy, learning, and, behavioral, difficulties, as, well, as, decreased, intelligence, these, occur, in, about, 15, of, survivors, some, of, the, hearing, loss, may, be, reversible, in, adults, 66, of, all, cases, emerge, without, disability, the, main, problems, are, deafness, in, 14, and, cognitive, impairment, in, 10, tuberculous, meningitis, in, children, continues, to, be, associated, with, a, significant, risk, of, death, even, with, treatment, 19, and, a, significant, proportion, of, the, surviving, children, have, ongoing, neurological, problems, just, over, a, third, of, all, cases, survives, with, no, problems, although, meningitis, is, a, notifiable, disease, in, many, countries, the, exact, incidence, rate, is, unknown, in, 2013, meningitis, resulted, in, 303, 000, deaths, down, from, 464, 000, deaths, in, 1990, in, 2010, it, was, estimated, that, meningitis, resulted, in, 420, 000, deaths, excluding, cryptococcal, meningitis, bacterial, meningitis, occurs, in, about, 3, people, per, 100, 000, annually, in, western, countries, population, wide, studies, have, shown, that, viral, meningitis, is, more, common, at, 10, 9, per, 100, 000, and, occurs, more, often, in, the, summer, in, brazil, the, rate, of, bacterial, meningitis, is, higher, at, 45, 8, per, 100, 000, annually, sub, saharan, africa, has, been, plagued, by, large, epidemics, of, meningococcal, meningitis, for, over, a, century, leading, to, it, being, labeled, the, meningitis, belt, epidemics, typically, occur, in, the, dry, season, december, to, june, and, an, epidemic, wave, can, last, two, to, three, years, dying, out, during, the, intervening, rainy, seasons, attack, rates, of, 100, 800, cases, per, 100, 000, are, encountered, in, this, area, which, is, poorly, served, by, medical, care, these, cases, are, predominantly, caused, by, meningococci, the, largest, epidemic, ever, recorded, in, history, swept, across, the, entire, region, in, 1996, 1997, causing, over, 250, 000, cases, and, 25, 000, deaths, meningococcal, disease, occurs, in, epidemics, in, areas, where, many, people, live, together, for, the, first, time, such, as, army, barracks, during, mobilization, university, and, college, campuses, and, the, annual, hajj, pilgrimage, although, the, pattern, of, epidemic, cycles, in, africa, is, not, well, understood, several, factors, have, been, associated, with, the, development, of, epidemics, in, the, meningitis, belt, they, include, medical, conditions, immunological, susceptibility, of, the, population, demographic, conditions, travel, and, large, population, displacements, socioeconomic, conditions, overcrowding, and, poor, living, conditions, climatic, conditions, drought, and, dust, storms, and, concurrent, infections, acute, respiratory, infections, there, are, significant, differences, in, the, local, distribution, of, causes, for, bacterial, meningitis, for, instance, while, n, meningitides, groups, b, and, c, cause, most, disease, episodes, in, europe, group, a, is, found, in, asia, and, continues, to, predominate, in, africa, where, it, causes, most, of, the, major, epidemics, in, the, meningitis, belt, accounting, for, about, 80, to, 85, of, documented, meningococcal, meningitis, cases, some, suggest, that, hippocrates, may, have, realized, the, existence, of, meningitis, and, it, seems, that, meningism, was, known, to, pre, renaissance, physicians, such, as, avicenna, the, description, of, tuberculous, meningitis, then, called, dropsy, in, the, brain, is, often, attributed, to, edinburgh, physician, sir, robert, whytt, in, a, posthumous, report, that, appeared, in, 1768, although, the, link, with, tuberculosis, and, its, pathogen, was, not, made, until, the, next, century, it, appears, that, epidemic, meningitis, is, a, relatively, recent, phenomenon, the, first, recorded, major, outbreak, occurred, in, geneva, in, 1805, several, other, epidemics, in, europe, and, the, united, states, were, described, shortly, afterward, and, the, first, report, of, an, epidemic, in, africa, appeared, in, 1840, african, epidemics, became, much, more, common, in, the, 20th, century, starting, with, a, major, epidemic, sweeping, nigeria, and, ghana, in, 1905, 1908, the, first, report, of, bacterial, infection, underlying, meningitis, was, by, the, austrian, bacteriologist, anton, weichselbaum, who, in, 1887, described, the, meningococcus, mortality, from, meningitis, was, very, high, over, 90, in, early, reports, in, 1906, antiserum, was, produced, in, horses, this, was, developed, further, by, the, american, scientist, simon, flexner, and, markedly, decreased, mortality, from, meningococcal, disease, in, 1944, penicillin, was, first, reported, to, be, effective, in, meningitis, the, introduction, in, the, late, 20th, century, of, haemophilus, vaccines, led, to, a, marked, fall, in, cases, of, meningitis, associated, with, this, pathogen, and, in, 2002, evidence, emerged, that, treatment, with, steroids, could, improve, the, prognosis, of, bacterial, meningitis, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease
