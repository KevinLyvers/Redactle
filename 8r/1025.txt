see, text, an, apricot, us, p, r, k, t, uk, e, p, r, k, t, is, a, fruit, or, the, tree, that, bears, the, fruit, of, several, species, in, the, genus, prunus, usually, an, apricot, is, from, the, species, p, armeniaca, but, the, fruits, of, the, other, species, in, prunus, sect, armeniaca, are, also, called, apricots, in, 2022, world, production, of, apricots, was, 3, 9, million, tonnes, led, by, turkey, with, 21, of, the, total, apricot, first, appeared, in, english, in, the, 16th, century, as, abrecock, from, the, middle, french, aubercot, or, later, abricot, from, spanish, albaricoque, and, catalan, a, l, bercoc, in, turn, from, arabic, al, barq, q, the, plums, from, byzantine, greek, berikokk, apricot, tree, derived, from, late, greek, praik, kion, apricot, from, latin, praecocia, praecoquus, early, ripening, the, apricot, is, a, small, tree, 8, 12, metres, 26, 39, feet, tall, with, a, trunk, up, to, 40, centimetres, 16, inches, in, diameter, and, a, dense, spreading, canopy, the, leaves, are, ovate, 5, 9, cm, 2, 3, 1, 2, in, long, and, 4, 8, cm, 1, 1, 2, 3, in, wide, with, a, rounded, base, a, pointed, tip, and, a, finely, serrated, margin, the, flowers, are, 2, 4, 5, cm, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, in, in, diameter, with, five, white, to, pinkish, petals, they, are, produced, singly, or, in, pairs, in, early, spring, before, the, leaves, the, fruit, is, a, drupe, stonefruit, similar, to, a, small, peach, 1, 5, 2, 5, cm, 1, 2, 1, in, diameter, larger, in, some, modern, cultivars, from, yellow, to, orange, often, tinged, red, on, the, side, most, exposed, to, the, sun, its, surface, can, be, smooth, botanically, described, as, glabrous, or, velvety, with, very, short, hairs, botanically, pubescent, the, flesh, is, usually, succulent, but, dry, in, some, species, such, as, p, sibirica, its, taste, can, range, from, sweet, to, tart, the, single, seed, or, kernel, is, enclosed, in, a, hard, shell, often, called, a, stone, with, a, grainy, smooth, texture, except, for, three, ridges, running, down, one, side, apricots, contain, various, phytochemicals, such, as, provitamin, a, beta, carotene, and, polyphenols, including, catechins, and, chlorogenic, acid, taste, and, aroma, compounds, include, sucrose, glucose, organic, acids, terpenes, aldehydes, and, lactones, apricots, are, species, belonging, to, prunus, sect, armeniaca, the, taxonomic, position, of, p, brigantina, is, disputed, it, is, grouped, with, plum, species, according, to, chloroplast, dna, sequences, but, more, closely, related, to, apricot, species, according, to, nuclear, dna, sequences, the, most, commonly, cultivated, apricot, p, armeniaca, was, known, in, armenia, during, ancient, times, and, has, been, cultivated, there, for, so, long, that, it, was, previously, thought, to, have, originated, there, hence, the, epithet, of, its, scientific, name, however, this, is, not, supported, by, genetic, studies, which, instead, confirm, the, hypothesis, proposed, by, nikolai, vavilov, that, domestication, of, p, armeniaca, occurred, in, central, asia, and, china, the, domesticated, apricot, then, diffused, south, to, south, asia, west, to, west, asia, including, armenia, europe, and, north, africa, and, east, to, japan, japanese, apricot, p, mume, is, another, widely, cultivated, apricot, species, usually, for, ornamental, uses, despite, the, common, name, it, originated, from, china, and, was, introduced, to, japan, in, ancient, times, apricots, have, a, chilling, requirement, of, 300, to, 900, chilling, units, a, dry, climate, is, good, for, fruit, maturation, the, tree, is, slightly, more, cold, hardy, than, the, peach, tolerating, winter, temperatures, as, cold, as, 30, c, 22, f, or, lower, if, healthy, however, large, differences, are, observed, between, cultivars, in, frost, resistance, they, are, hardy, in, usda, zones, 5, through, 8, a, limiting, factor, in, apricot, culture, is, spring, frosts, they, tend, to, flower, very, early, in, early, march, in, western, europe, and, spring, frost, can, kill, flowers, or, before, flower, buds, in, different, stages, of, development, furthermore, the, trees, are, sensitive, to, temperature, changes, during, the, winter, season, in, china, winters, can, be, very, cold, but, temperatures, tend, to, be, more, stable, than, in, europe, and, especially, north, america, where, large, temperature, swings, can, occur, in, winter, hybridization, with, the, closely, related, prunus, sibirica, siberian, apricot, hardy, to, 50, c, 58, f, but, with, less, palatable, fruit, offers, options, for, breeding, more, cold, tolerant, plants, they, prefer, well, drained, soils, with, a, ph, of, 6, 0, to, 7, 0, apricot, cultivars, are, usually, grafted, onto, plum, or, peach, rootstocks, the, cultivar, scion, provides, the, fruit, characteristics, such, as, flavor, and, size, but, the, rootstock, provides, the, growth, characteristics, of, the, plant, some, of, the, more, popular, us, apricot, cultivars, are, blenheim, wenatchee, moorpark, tilton, and, perfection, some, apricot, cultivars, are, self, compatible, so, do, not, require, pollinizer, trees, others, are, not, moongold, and, sungold, for, example, must, be, planted, in, pairs, so, they, can, pollinate, each, other, hybridisors, have, created, what, is, known, as, a, black, apricot, or, purple, apricot, prunus, dasycarpa, a, hybrid, of, an, apricot, and, the, cherry, plum, prunus, cerasifera, other, apricot, plum, hybrids, are, variously, called, plumcots, apriplums, pluots, or, apriums, apricots, are, susceptible, to, various, diseases, whose, relative, importance, differs, in, the, major, production, regions, as, a, consequence, of, their, climatic, differences, for, example, hot, weather, as, experienced, in, california, s, central, valley, often, causes, pit, burn, a, condition, of, soft, and, brown, fruit, around, the, pit, bacterial, diseases, include, bacterial, spot, and, crown, gall, fungal, diseases, include, brown, rot, caused, by, monilinia, fructicola, infection, of, the, blossom, by, rainfall, leads, to, blossom, wilt, whereby, the, blossoms, and, young, shoots, turn, brown, and, die, the, twigs, die, back, in, a, severe, attack, brown, rot, of, the, fruit, is, due, to, monilinia, infection, later, in, the, season, dieback, of, branches, in, the, summer, is, attributed, to, the, fungus, eutypa, lata, where, examination, of, the, base, of, the, dead, branch, reveals, a, canker, surrounding, a, pruning, wound, other, fungal, diseases, are, black, knot, alternaria, spot, and, fruit, rot, and, powdery, mildew, unlike, peaches, apricots, are, not, affected, by, leaf, curl, and, bacterial, canker, causing, sunken, patches, in, the, bark, which, then, spread, and, kill, the, affected, branch, or, tree, and, silver, leaf, are, not, serious, threats, which, means, that, pruning, in, late, winter, is, considered, safe, due, to, their, natural, amygdalin, content, culinary, uses, for, the, kernel, are, limited, oil, made, from, apricot, kernels, is, safe, for, human, consumption, without, treatment, because, amygdalin, is, not, oil, soluble, ground, up, shells, are, used, in, cosmetics, as, an, exfoliant, as, an, exfoliant, it, provides, an, alternative, to, plastic, microbeads, in, 2022, world, production, of, apricots, was, 3, 86, million, tonnes, led, by, turkey, with, 21, of, the, total, table, other, major, producers, in, descending, order, were, uzbekistan, iran, italy, and, algeria, malatya, is, the, center, of, turkey, s, apricot, industry, apricot, kernels, seeds, contain, amygdalin, a, poisonous, compound, on, average, bitter, apricot, kernels, contain, about, 5, amygdalin, and, sweet, kernels, about, 0, 9, amygdalin, these, values, correspond, to, 0, 3, and, 0, 05, of, cyanide, since, a, typical, apricot, kernel, weighs, 600, mg, bitter, and, sweet, varieties, contain, respectively, 1, 8, and, 0, 3, mg, of, cyanide, apricot, kernels, can, be, made, into, a, plant, milk, apricots, are, commonly, consumed, either, as, raw, fruit, or, after, dehydration, as, a, dried, fruit, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, g, 3, 5, oz, raw, apricots, supply, 48, calories, and, are, composed, of, 11, carbohydrates, 1, protein, less, than, 1, fat, and, 86, water, table, raw, apricots, are, a, moderate, source, of, vitamin, a, and, vitamin, c, 11, of, the, daily, value, each, dried, apricots, are, a, type, of, traditional, dried, fruit, dried, apricots, are, 63, carbohydrates, 31, water, 4, protein, and, contain, negligible, fat, when, apricots, are, dried, the, relative, concentration, of, micronutrients, is, increased, with, vitamin, a, vitamin, e, and, potassium, having, rich, contents, daily, values, above, 20, table, the, apricot, is, the, national, fruit, of, armenia, mostly, growing, in, the, ararat, plain, it, is, often, depicted, on, souvenirs, the, chinese, associate, the, apricot, with, education, and, medicine, for, instance, the, classical, word, literally, apricot, altar, x, ng, t, n, which, means, educational, circle, is, still, widely, used, in, written, language, chuang, tzu, a, chinese, philosopher, in, the, fourth, century, bc, told, a, story, that, confucius, taught, his, students, in, a, forum, surrounded, by, the, wood, of, apricot, trees, the, association, with, medicine, in, turn, comes, from, the, common, use, of, apricot, kernels, as, a, component, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, and, from, the, story, of, dong, feng, a, physician, during, the, three, kingdoms, period, who, required, no, payment, from, his, patients, except, that, they, plant, apricot, trees, in, his, orchard, upon, recovering, from, their, illnesses, resulting, in, a, large, grove, of, apricot, trees, and, a, steady, supply, of, medicinal, ingredients, the, term, expert, of, the, apricot, grove, is, still, used, as, a, poetic, reference, to, physicians, the, fact, that, apricot,
