hieraspiza, kaup, 1844, but, see, text, accipiter, k, s, p, d, r, is, a, genus, of, birds, of, prey, in, the, family, accipitridae, with, around, 50, recognized, species, it, is, the, most, diverse, genus, in, its, family, most, species, are, called, goshawks, or, sparrowhawks, although, with, the, exception, of, the, american, goshawk, almost, all, new, world, species, are, simply, known, as, hawks, they, can, be, anatomically, distinguished, from, their, relatives, by, the, lack, of, a, procoracoid, foramen, two, small, and, aberrant, species, usually, placed, here, do, possess, a, large, procoracoid, foramen, and, are, also, distinct, as, regards, dna, sequence, they, may, warrant, separation, in, the, old, genus, hieraspiza, extant, accipiters, range, in, size, from, the, little, sparrowhawk, a, minullus, in, which, the, smallest, males, measure, 20, cm, 7, 9, in, long, span, 39, cm, 15, in, across, the, wings, and, weigh, 68, g, 2, 4, oz, to, the, northern, goshawk, a, gentilis, in, which, the, largest, females, measure, 64, cm, 25, in, long, span, 127, cm, 50, in, across, the, wings, and, weigh, 2, 2, kg, 4, 9, lb, these, birds, are, slender, with, short, broad, rounded, wings, and, a, long, tail, which, helps, them, maneuver, in, flight, they, have, long, legs, and, long, sharp, talons, used, to, kill, their, prey, and, a, sharp, hooked, bill, used, in, feeding, females, tend, to, be, larger, than, males, they, often, ambush, their, prey, mainly, small, birds, and, mammals, capturing, them, after, a, short, chase, the, typical, flight, pattern, is, a, series, of, flaps, followed, by, a, short, glide, they, are, commonly, found, in, wooded, or, shrubby, areas, the, genus, accipiter, was, introduced, by, the, french, zoologist, mathurin, jacques, brisson, in, 1760, the, type, species, is, the, eurasian, sparrowhawk, accipiter, nisus, the, name, is, latin, for, hawk, from, accipere, to, grasp, the, procoracoid, foramen, or, coracoid, foramen, coracoid, fenestra, is, a, hole, through, the, process, at, the, front, of, the, coracoid, bone, which, accommodates, the, supracoracoideus, nerve, in, some, groups, of, birds, it, may, be, present, as, a, notch, or, incisura, or, the, notch, may, be, partially, or, weakly, closed, with, bone, in, other, groups, the, feature, is, completely, absent, the, foramen, is, generally, present, in, birds, of, prey, but, it, is, absent, in, most, accipiter, hawks, that, have, been, studied, this, absence, is, proposed, as, a, diagnostic, feature, a, study, of, accipitrid, skeletons, found, procoracoid, incisurae, as, opposed, to, foramina, in, some, specimens, of, the, eagles, aquila, gurneyi, and, a, chrysaetos, but, not, in, four, other, aquila, species, the, notch, was, variably, open, or, weakly, ossified, in, spizastur, melanoleucos, lophoaetus, occipitalis, spizaetus, ornatus, and, stephanoaetus, coronatus, also, the, buteonine, hawks, buteo, brachyurus, and, b, hemilasius, had, incisurae, differing, from, 17, other, buteo, species, in, circus, the, foramen, was, found, to, be, variable, not, only, within, species, but, even, between, sides, in, the, same, individual, it, is, usually, open, or, absent, but, may, be, closed, by, a, thread, of, bone, research, in, genetic, phylogeny, has, since, indicated, that, circus, is, closely, related, to, accipiter, the, notch, was, also, absent, or, indistinct, in, harpagus, bidentatus, urotriorchis, macrourus, has, a, well, developed, procoracoid, foramen, which, suggests, a, separation, from, accipiter, it, may, be, related, to, the, chanting, goshawks, in, tribe, melieraxini, the, genus, accipiter, formerly, contained, around, 50, species, a, series, of, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, found, that, the, traditional, arrangement, was, non, monophyletic, the, publication, of, a, densely, sampled, study, of, the, accipitridae, in, 2024, allowed, the, generic, boundaries, to, be, redefine, to, create, monophyletic, genera, species, were, moved, from, accipiter, to, five, new, or, resurrected, genera, leaving, only, 9, species, in, accipiter, the, southeast, asian, crested, goshawk, and, the, sulawesi, goshawk, were, found, to, be, only, distantly, related, to, other, species, in, accipiter, they, were, moved, to, a, resurrected, genus, lophospiza, the, only, genus, placed, in, the, new, subfamily, lophospizinae, similarly, the, very, small, south, america, tiny, hawk, and, semicollared, hawk, were, found, to, be, only, distantly, related, to, species, in, accipiter, they, were, moved, to, a, newly, erected, genus, microspizias, which, together, with, harpagus, is, placed, in, the, subfamily, harpaginae, the, genera, circus, megatriorchis, and, erythrotriorchis, were, found, to, be, nested, within, accipiter, rather, than, subsuming, these, genera, into, an, expanded, accipiter, species, were, moved, from, accipiter, to, the, resurrected, genera, aerospiza, tachyspiza, and, astur, there, are, 9, species, in, the, accipiter, genus
