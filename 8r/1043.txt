a, grape, is, a, fruit, botanically, a, berry, of, the, deciduous, woody, vines, of, the, flowering, plant, genus, vitis, grapes, are, a, non, climacteric, type, of, fruit, generally, occurring, in, clusters, the, cultivation, of, grapes, began, approximately, 8, 000, years, ago, and, the, fruit, has, been, used, as, human, food, throughout, its, history, eaten, fresh, or, in, dried, form, as, raisins, currants, and, sultanas, grapes, also, hold, cultural, significance, in, many, parts, of, the, world, particularly, for, their, role, in, winemaking, other, grape, derived, products, include, various, types, of, jam, juice, vinegar, and, oil, the, middle, east, is, generally, described, as, the, homeland, of, grapes, and, the, cultivation, of, this, plant, began, there, 6, 000, 8, 000, years, ago, yeast, one, of, the, earliest, domesticated, microorganisms, occurs, naturally, on, the, skins, of, grapes, leading, to, the, discovery, of, alcoholic, drinks, such, as, wine, the, earliest, archeological, evidence, for, a, dominant, position, of, wine, making, in, human, culture, dates, from, 8, 000, years, ago, in, georgia, the, oldest, known, winery, was, found, in, armenia, dating, to, around, 4000, bc, by, the, 9th, century, ad, the, city, of, shiraz, was, known, to, produce, some, of, the, finest, wines, in, the, middle, east, thus, it, has, been, proposed, that, syrah, red, wine, is, named, after, shiraz, a, city, in, persia, where, the, grape, was, used, to, make, shirazi, wine, ancient, egyptian, hieroglyphics, record, the, cultivation, of, purple, grapes, and, history, attests, to, the, ancient, greeks, cypriots, phoenicians, and, romans, growing, purple, grapes, both, for, eating, and, wine, production, the, growing, of, grapes, would, later, spread, to, other, regions, in, europe, as, well, as, north, africa, and, eventually, in, north, america, in, 2005, a, team, of, archaeologists, concluded, that, some, chalcolithic, wine, jars, which, were, discovered, in, cyprus, in, the, 1930s, were, the, oldest, of, their, kind, in, the, world, dating, back, to, 3, 500, bc, moreover, commandaria, a, sweet, dessert, wine, from, cyprus, is, the, oldest, manufactured, wine, in, the, world, its, origins, traced, as, far, back, as, 2000, bc, in, north, america, native, grapes, belonging, to, various, species, of, the, genus, vitis, proliferate, in, the, wild, across, the, continent, and, were, a, part, of, the, diet, of, many, native, americans, but, they, were, considered, by, early, european, colonists, to, be, unsuitable, for, wine, in, the, 19th, century, ephraim, bull, of, concord, massachusetts, cultivated, seeds, from, wild, vitis, labrusca, vines, to, create, the, concord, grape, which, would, become, an, important, agricultural, crop, in, the, united, states, grapes, are, a, type, of, fruit, that, grow, in, clusters, of, 15, to, 300, and, can, be, crimson, black, dark, blue, yellow, green, orange, and, pink, white, grapes, are, actually, green, in, color, and, are, evolutionarily, derived, from, the, purple, grape, mutations, in, two, regulatory, genes, of, white, grapes, turn, off, production, of, anthocyanins, which, are, responsible, for, the, color, of, purple, grapes, anthocyanins, and, other, pigment, chemicals, of, the, larger, family, of, polyphenols, in, purple, grapes, are, responsible, for, the, varying, shades, of, purple, in, red, wines, grapes, are, typically, an, ellipsoid, shape, resembling, a, prolate, spheroid, raw, grapes, are, 81, water, 18, carbohydrates, 1, protein, and, have, negligible, fat, table, a, 100, gram, 3, 1, 2, ounce, reference, amount, of, raw, grapes, supplies, 288, kilojoules, 69, kilocalories, of, food, energy, and, a, moderate, amount, of, vitamin, k, 14, of, the, daily, value, with, no, other, micronutrients, in, significant, amounts, most, domesticated, grapes, come, from, cultivars, of, vitis, vinifera, a, grapevine, native, to, the, mediterranean, and, central, asia, minor, amounts, of, fruit, and, wine, come, from, american, and, asian, species, such, as, according, to, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, 75, 866, square, kilometers, of, the, world, are, dedicated, to, grapes, approximately, 71, of, world, grape, production, is, used, for, wine, 27, as, fresh, fruit, and, 2, as, dried, fruit, a, portion, of, grape, production, goes, to, producing, grape, juice, to, be, reconstituted, for, fruits, canned, with, no, added, sugar, and, 100, natural, the, area, dedicated, to, vineyards, is, increasing, by, about, 2, per, year, there, are, no, reliable, statistics, that, break, down, grape, production, by, variety, it, is, believed, that, the, most, widely, planted, variety, is, sultana, also, known, as, thompson, seedless, with, at, least, 3, 600, km, 2, 880, 000, acres, dedicated, to, it, the, second, most, common, variety, is, air, n, other, popular, varieties, include, cabernet, sauvignon, sauvignon, blanc, cabernet, franc, merlot, grenache, tempranillo, riesling, and, chardonnay, commercially, cultivated, grapes, can, usually, be, classified, as, either, table, or, wine, grapes, based, on, their, intended, method, of, consumption, eaten, raw, table, grapes, or, used, to, make, wine, wine, grapes, the, sweetness, of, grapes, depends, on, when, they, are, harvested, as, they, do, not, continue, to, ripen, once, picked, while, almost, all, of, them, belong, to, the, same, species, vitis, vinifera, table, and, wine, grapes, have, significant, differences, brought, about, through, selective, breeding, table, grape, cultivars, tend, to, have, large, seedless, fruit, see, below, with, relatively, thin, skin, wine, grapes, are, smaller, usually, seeded, and, have, relatively, thick, skins, a, desirable, characteristic, in, winemaking, since, much, of, the, aroma, in, wine, comes, from, the, skin, wine, grapes, also, tend, to, be, very, sweet, they, are, harvested, at, the, time, when, their, juice, is, approximately, 24, sugar, by, weight, by, comparison, commercially, produced, 100, grape, juice, made, from, table, grapes, is, usually, around, 15, sugar, by, weight, seedless, cultivars, now, make, up, the, overwhelming, majority, of, table, grape, plantings, because, grapevines, are, vegetatively, propagated, by, cuttings, the, lack, of, seeds, does, not, present, a, problem, for, reproduction, it, is, an, issue, for, breeders, who, must, either, use, a, seeded, variety, as, the, female, parent, or, rescue, embryos, early, in, development, using, tissue, culture, techniques, there, are, several, sources, of, the, seedlessness, trait, and, essentially, all, commercial, cultivators, get, it, from, one, of, three, sources, thompson, seedless, russian, seedless, and, black, monukka, all, being, cultivars, of, vitis, vinifera, there, are, currently, more, than, a, dozen, varieties, of, seedless, grapes, several, such, as, einset, seedless, benjamin, gunnels, s, prime, seedless, grapes, reliance, and, venus, have, been, specifically, cultivated, for, hardiness, and, quality, in, the, relatively, cold, climates, of, northeastern, united, states, and, southern, ontario, an, offset, to, the, improved, eating, quality, of, seedlessness, is, the, loss, of, potential, health, benefits, provided, by, the, enriched, phytochemical, content, of, grape, seeds, see, health, claims, below, grapes, are, eaten, raw, dried, as, raisins, currants, and, sultanas, or, cooked, also, depending, on, grape, cultivar, grapes, are, used, in, winemaking, grapes, can, be, processed, into, a, multitude, of, products, such, as, jams, juices, vinegars, and, oils, commercially, cultivated, grapes, are, classified, as, either, table, or, wine, grapes, these, categories, are, based, on, their, intended, method, of, consumption, grapes, that, are, eaten, raw, table, grapes, or, grapes, that, are, used, to, make, wine, wine, grapes, table, grape, cultivars, normally, have, large, seedless, fruit, and, thin, skins, wine, grapes, are, smaller, in, comparison, to, table, grapes, usually, contains, seeds, and, have, thicker, skins, a, desirable, characteristic, in, making, wine, most, of, the, aroma, in, wine, is, from, the, skin, wine, grapes, tend, to, have, a, high, sugar, content, they, are, harvested, at, peak, sugar, levels, approximately, 24, sugar, by, weight, in, comparison, commercially, produced, 100, grape, juice, made, from, table, grapes, are, normally, around, 15, sugar, by, weight, in, most, of, europe, and, north, america, dried, grapes, are, referred, to, as, raisins, or, the, local, equivalent, in, the, uk, three, different, varieties, are, recognized, forcing, the, eu, to, use, the, term, dried, vine, fruit, in, official, documents, a, raisin, is, any, dried, grape, while, raisin, is, a, french, loanword, the, word, in, french, refers, to, the, fresh, fruit, grappe, from, which, the, english, grape, is, derived, refers, to, the, bunch, as, in, une, grappe, de, raisins, a, raisin, in, french, is, called, raisin, sec, dry, grape, a, currant, is, a, dried, zante, black, corinth, grape, the, name, being, a, corruption, of, the, french, raisin, de, corinthe, corinth, grape, the, names, of, the, black, and, red, currant, now, more, usually, blackcurrant, and, redcurrant, two, berries, unrelated, to, grapes, are, derived, from, this, use, some, other, fruits, of, similar, appearance, are, also, so, named, for, example, australian, currant, native, currant, indian, currant, a, sultana, was, originally, a, raisin, made, from, sultana, grapes, of, turkish, origin, known, as, thompson, seedless, in, the, united, states, but, the, word, is, now, applied, to, raisins, made, from, either, white, grapes, or, red, grapes, that, are, bleached, to, resemble, the, traditional, sultana, grape, juice, is, obtained, from, crushing, and, blending, grapes, into, a, liquid, the, juice, is, often, sold, in, stores, or, fermented, and, made, into, wine, brandy, or, vinegar, grape, juice, that, has, been, pasteurized, removing, any, naturally, occurring, yeast, will, not, ferment, if, kept, sterile, and, thus, contains, no, alcohol, in, the, wine, industry, grape, juice, that, contains, 7, 23, of, pulp, skins, stems, and, seeds, is, often, referred, to, as, must, in, north, america, the, most, common, grape, juice, is, purple, and, made, from, concord, grapes, while, white, grape, juice, is, commonly, made, from, niagara, grapes, both, of, which, are, varieties, of, native, american, grapes, a, different, species, from, european, wine, grapes, in, california, sultana, known, there, as, thompson, seedless, grapes, are, sometimes, diverted, from, the, raisin, or, table, market, to, produce, white, juice, husrum, also, known, as, verjuice, is, a, type, of, vinegar, made, from, sour, grapes, in, the, middle, east, it, is, produced, by, crushing, unripened, grapes, collecting, and, salting, the, juice, simmering, it, to, remove, foam, and, then, storing, it, with, a, layer, of, olive, oil, to, prevent, contamination, and, oxidation, it, is, then, used, as, an, acidic, ingredient, in, salads, and, stuffed, vegetables, unripened, husrum, grapes, sent, from, ashkelon, to, egypt, are, mentioned, in, a, 12th, century, document, found, in, the, cairo, geniza, in, iran, a, sour, grape, vinegar, is, used, for, making, shirazi, salad, winemaking, from, red, and, white, grape, flesh, and, skins, produces, substantial, quantities, of, organic, residues, collectively, called, pomace, also, marc, which, includes, crushed, skins, seeds, stems, and, leaves, generally, used, as, compost, grape, pomace, some, 10, 30, of, the, total, mass, of, grapes, crushed, contains, various, phytochemicals, such, as, unfermented, sugars, alcohol, polyphenols, tannins, anthocyanins, and, numerous, other, compounds, some, of, which, are, harvested, and, extracted, for, commercial, applications, a, process, sometimes, called, valorization, of, the, pomace, anthocyanins, tend, to, be, the, main, polyphenolics, in, purple, grapes, whereas, flavan, 3, ols, i, e, catechins, are, the, more, abundant, class, of, polyphenols, in, white, varieties, total, phenolic, content, is, higher, in, purple, varieties, due, almost, entirely, to, anthocyanin, density, in, purple, grape, skin, compared, to, absence, of, anthocyanins, in, white, grape, skin, phenolic, content, of, grape, skin, varies, with, cultivar, soil, composition, climate, geographic, origin, and, cultivation, practices, or, exposure, to, diseases, such, as, fungal, infections, muscadine, grapes, contain, a, relatively, high, phenolic, content, among, dark, grapes, in, muscadine, skins, ellagic, acid, myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and, trans, resveratrol, are, major, phenolics, the, flavonols, syringetin, syringetin, 3, o, galactoside, laricitrin, and, laricitrin, 3, o, galactoside, are, also, found, in, purple, grape, but, absent, in, white, grape, muscadine, grape, seeds, contain, about, twice, the, total, polyphenol, content, of, skins, grape, seed, oil, from, crushed, seeds, is, used, in, cosmeceuticals, and, skincare, products, grape, seed, oil, including, tocopherols, vitamin, e, and, high, contents, of, phytosterols, and, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, such, as, linoleic, acid, oleic, acid, and, alpha, linolenic, acid, resveratrol, a, stilbene, compound, is, found, in, widely, varying, amounts, among, grape, varieties, primarily, in, their, skins, and, seeds, muscadine, grapes, have, about, one, hundred, times, higher, concentration, of, stilbenes, than, pulp, fresh, grape, skin, contains, about, 50, to, 100, micrograms, of, resveratrol, per, gram, comparing, diets, among, western, countries, researchers, have, discovered, that, although, french, people, tend, to, eat, higher, levels, of, animal, fat, the, incidence, of, heart, disease, remains, low, in, france, this, phenomenon, has, been, termed, the, french, paradox, and, is, thought, to, occur, due, to, the, protective, benefits, of, regularly, consuming, red, wine, among, other, dietary, practices, alcohol, consumption, in, moderation, may, be, cardioprotective, by, its, minor, anticoagulant, effect, and, vasodilation, although, adoption, of, wine, consumption, is, generally, not, recommended, by, health, authorities, some, research, indicates, moderate, consumption, such, as, one, glass, of, red, wine, a, day, for, women, and, two, for, men, may, confer, health, benefits, alcohol, itself, may, have, protective, effects, on, the, cardiovascular, system, the, consumption, of, grapes, and, raisins, presents, a, potential, health, threat, to, dogs, their, toxicity, to, dogs, can, cause, the, animal, to, develop, acute, kidney, failure, the, sudden, development, of, kidney, failure, with, anuria, a, lack, of, urine, production, and, may, be, fatal, christians, have, traditionally, used, wine, during, worship, services, as, a, means, of, remembering, the, blood, of, jesus, christ, which, was, shed, for, the, remission, of, sins, christians, who, oppose, the, partaking, of, alcoholic, beverages, sometimes, use, grape, juice, as, the, cup, or, wine, in, the, lord, s, supper, the, catholic, church, continues, to, use, wine, in, the, celebration, of, the, eucharist, because, it, is, part, of, the, tradition, passed, down, through, the, ages, starting, with, jesus, christ, at, the, last, supper, where, catholics, believe, the, consecrated, bread, and, wine, become, the, body, and, blood, of, jesus, christ, a, dogma, known, as, transubstantiation, wine, is, used, not, grape, juice, both, due, to, its, strong, scriptural, roots, and, also, to, follow, the, tradition, set, by, the, early, christian, church, the, code, of, canon, law, of, the, catholic, church, 1983, canon, 924, says, that, the, wine, used, must, be, natural, made, from, grapes, of, the, vine, and, not, corrupt
