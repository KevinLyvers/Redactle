fungal, infection, also, known, as, mycosis, is, a, disease, caused, by, fungi, different, types, are, traditionally, divided, according, to, the, part, of, the, body, affected, superficial, subcutaneous, and, systemic, superficial, fungal, infections, include, common, tinea, of, the, skin, such, as, tinea, of, the, body, groin, hands, feet, and, beard, and, yeast, infections, such, as, pityriasis, versicolor, subcutaneous, types, include, eumycetoma, and, chromoblastomycosis, which, generally, affect, tissues, in, and, beneath, the, skin, systemic, fungal, infections, are, more, serious, and, include, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, pneumocystis, pneumonia, aspergillosis, and, mucormycosis, signs, and, symptoms, range, widely, there, is, usually, a, rash, with, superficial, infection, fungal, infection, within, the, skin, or, under, the, skin, may, present, with, a, lump, and, skin, changes, pneumonia, like, symptoms, or, meningitis, may, occur, with, a, deeper, or, systemic, infection, fungi, are, everywhere, but, only, some, cause, disease, fungal, infection, occurs, after, spores, are, either, breathed, in, come, into, contact, with, skin, or, enter, the, body, through, the, skin, such, as, via, a, cut, wound, or, injection, it, is, more, likely, to, occur, in, people, with, a, weak, immune, system, this, includes, people, with, illnesses, such, as, hiv, aids, and, people, taking, medicines, such, as, steroids, or, cancer, treatments, fungi, that, cause, infections, in, people, include, yeasts, molds, and, fungi, that, are, able, to, exist, as, both, a, mold, and, yeast, the, yeast, candida, albicans, can, live, in, people, without, producing, symptoms, and, is, able, to, cause, both, superficial, mild, candidiasis, in, healthy, people, such, as, oral, thrush, or, vaginal, yeast, infection, and, severe, systemic, candidiasis, in, those, who, cannot, fight, infection, themselves, diagnosis, is, generally, based, on, signs, and, symptoms, microscopy, culture, sometimes, requiring, a, biopsy, and, the, aid, of, medical, imaging, some, superficial, fungal, infections, of, the, skin, can, appear, similar, to, other, skin, conditions, such, as, eczema, and, lichen, planus, treatment, is, generally, performed, using, antifungal, medicines, usually, in, the, form, of, a, cream, or, by, mouth, or, injection, depending, on, the, specific, infection, and, its, extent, some, require, surgically, cutting, out, infected, tissue, fungal, infections, have, a, world, wide, distribution, and, are, common, affecting, more, than, one, billion, people, every, year, an, estimated, 1, 7, million, deaths, from, fungal, disease, were, reported, in, 2020, several, including, sporotrichosis, chromoblastomycosis, and, mycetoma, are, neglected, a, wide, range, of, fungal, infections, occur, in, other, animals, and, some, can, be, transmitted, from, animals, to, people, mycoses, are, traditionally, divided, into, superficial, subcutaneous, or, systemic, where, infection, is, deep, more, widespread, and, involving, internal, body, organs, they, can, affect, the, nails, vagina, skin, and, mouth, some, types, such, as, blastomycosis, cryptococcus, coccidioidomycosis, and, histoplasmosis, affect, people, who, live, in, or, visit, certain, parts, of, the, world, others, such, as, aspergillosis, pneumocystis, pneumonia, candidiasis, mucormycosis, and, talaromycosis, tend, to, affect, people, who, are, unable, to, fight, infection, themselves, mycoses, might, not, always, conform, strictly, to, the, three, divisions, of, superficial, subcutaneous, and, systemic, some, superficial, fungal, infections, can, cause, systemic, infections, in, people, who, are, immunocompromised, some, subcutaneous, fungal, infections, can, invade, into, deeper, structures, resulting, in, systemic, disease, candida, albicans, can, live, in, people, without, producing, symptoms, and, is, able, to, cause, both, mild, candidiasis, in, healthy, people, and, severe, invasive, candidiasis, in, those, who, cannot, fight, infection, themselves, icd, 11, codes, include, superficial, mycoses, include, candidiasis, in, healthy, people, common, tinea, of, the, skin, such, as, tinea, of, the, body, groin, hands, feet, and, beard, and, malassezia, infections, such, as, pityriasis, versicolor, subcutaneous, fungal, infections, include, sporotrichosis, chromoblastomycosis, and, eumycetoma, systemic, fungal, infections, include, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, mucormycosis, aspergillosis, pneumocystis, pneumonia, and, systemic, candidiasis, systemic, mycoses, due, to, primary, pathogens, originate, normally, in, the, lungs, and, may, spread, to, other, organ, systems, organisms, that, cause, systemic, mycoses, are, inherently, virulent, systemic, mycoses, due, to, opportunistic, pathogens, are, infections, of, people, with, immune, deficiencies, who, would, otherwise, not, be, infected, examples, of, immunocompromised, conditions, include, aids, alteration, of, normal, flora, by, antibiotics, immunosuppressive, therapy, and, metastatic, cancer, examples, of, opportunistic, mycoses, include, candidiasis, cryptococcosis, and, aspergillosis, most, common, mild, mycoses, often, present, with, a, rash, infections, within, the, skin, or, under, the, skin, may, present, with, a, lump, and, skin, changes, less, common, deeper, fungal, infections, may, present, with, pneumonia, like, symptoms, or, meningitis, mycoses, are, caused, by, certain, fungi, yeasts, molds, and, some, fungi, that, can, exist, as, both, a, mold, and, yeast, they, are, everywhere, and, infection, occurs, after, spores, are, either, breathed, in, come, into, contact, with, skin, or, enter, the, body, through, the, skin, such, as, via, a, cut, wound, or, injection, candida, albicans, is, the, most, common, cause, of, fungal, infection, in, people, particularly, as, oral, or, vaginal, thrush, often, following, taking, antibiotics, fungal, infections, are, more, likely, in, people, with, weak, immune, systems, this, includes, people, with, illnesses, such, as, hiv, aids, and, people, taking, medicines, such, as, steroids, or, cancer, treatments, people, with, diabetes, also, tend, to, develop, fungal, infections, very, young, and, very, old, people, also, are, groups, at, risk, individuals, being, treated, with, antibiotics, are, at, higher, risk, of, fungal, infections, children, whose, immune, systems, are, not, functioning, properly, such, as, children, with, cancer, are, at, risk, of, invasive, fungal, infections, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, some, fungal, infections, have, been, associated, with, covid, 19, fungal, infections, can, mimic, covid, 19, occur, at, the, same, time, as, covid, 19, and, more, serious, fungal, infections, can, complicate, covid, 19, a, fungal, infection, may, occur, after, antibiotics, for, a, bacterial, infection, which, has, occurred, following, covid, 19, the, most, common, serious, fungal, infections, in, people, with, covid, 19, include, aspergillosis, and, invasive, candidiasis, covid, 19, associated, mucormycosis, is, generally, less, common, but, in, 2021, was, noted, to, be, significantly, more, prevalent, in, india, fungal, infections, occur, after, spores, are, either, breathed, in, come, into, contact, with, skin, or, enter, the, body, through, a, wound, diagnosis, is, generally, by, signs, and, symptoms, microscopy, biopsy, culture, and, sometimes, with, the, aid, of, medical, imaging, some, tinea, and, candidiasis, infections, of, the, skin, can, appear, similar, to, eczema, and, lichen, planus, pityriasis, versicolor, can, look, like, seborrheic, dermatitis, pityriasis, rosea, pityriasis, alba, and, vitiligo, some, fungal, infections, such, as, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and, blastomycosis, can, present, with, fever, cough, and, shortness, of, breath, thereby, resembling, covid, 19, keeping, the, skin, clean, and, dry, as, well, as, maintaining, good, hygiene, will, help, larger, topical, mycoses, because, some, fungal, infections, are, contagious, it, is, important, to, wash, hands, after, touching, other, people, or, animals, sports, clothing, should, also, be, washed, after, use, treatment, depends, on, the, type, of, fungal, infection, and, usually, requires, topical, or, systemic, antifungal, medicines, pneumocystosis, that, does, not, respond, to, anti, fungals, is, treated, with, co, trimoxazole, sometimes, infected, tissue, needs, to, be, surgically, cut, away, worldwide, every, year, fungal, infections, affect, more, than, one, billion, people, an, estimated, 1, 6, million, deaths, from, fungal, disease, were, reported, in, 2017, the, figure, has, been, rising, with, an, estimated, 1, 7, million, deaths, from, fungal, disease, reported, in, 2020, fungal, infections, also, constitute, a, significant, cause, of, illness, and, mortality, in, children, according, to, the, global, action, fund, for, fungal, infections, every, year, there, are, over, 10, million, cases, of, fungal, asthma, around, 3, million, cases, of, long, term, aspergillosis, of, lungs, 1, million, cases, of, blindness, due, to, fungal, keratitis, more, than, 200, 000, cases, of, meningitis, due, to, cryptococcus, 700, 000, cases, of, invasive, candidiasis, 500, 000, cases, of, pneumocystosis, of, lungs, 250, 000, cases, of, invasive, aspergillosis, and, 100, 000, cases, of, histoplasmosis, in, 500bc, an, apparent, account, of, ulcers, in, the, mouth, by, hippocrates, may, have, been, thrush, the, hungarian, microscopist, based, in, paris, david, gruby, first, reported, that, human, disease, could, be, caused, by, fungi, in, the, early, 1840s, during, the, 2003, sars, outbreak, fungal, infections, were, reported, in, 14, 8, 33, of, people, affected, by, sars, and, it, was, the, cause, of, death, in, 25, 73, 7, of, people, with, sars, a, wide, range, of, fungal, infections, occur, in, other, animals, and, some, can, be, transmitted, from, animals, to, people, such, as, microsporum, canis, from, cats
