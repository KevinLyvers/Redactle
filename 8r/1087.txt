the, almond, prunus, amygdalus, syn, prunus, dulcis, is, a, species, of, tree, from, the, genus, prunus, along, with, the, peach, it, is, classified, in, the, subgenus, amygdalus, distinguished, from, the, other, subgenera, by, corrugations, on, the, shell, endocarp, surrounding, the, seed, the, fruit, of, the, almond, is, a, drupe, consisting, of, an, outer, hull, and, a, hard, shell, with, the, seed, which, is, not, a, true, nut, shelling, almonds, refers, to, removing, the, shell, to, reveal, the, seed, almonds, are, sold, shelled, or, unshelled, blanched, almonds, are, shelled, almonds, that, have, been, treated, with, hot, water, to, soften, the, seedcoat, which, is, then, removed, to, reveal, the, white, embryo, once, almonds, are, cleaned, and, processed, they, can, be, stored, over, time, almonds, are, used, in, many, cuisines, often, featuring, prominently, in, desserts, such, as, marzipan, the, almond, tree, prospers, in, a, moderate, mediterranean, climate, with, cool, winter, weather, almond, is, rarely, found, wild, in, its, original, setting, almonds, were, one, of, the, earliest, domesticated, fruit, trees, due, to, the, ability, to, produce, quality, offspring, entirely, from, seed, without, using, suckers, and, cuttings, evidence, of, domesticated, almonds, in, the, early, bronze, age, has, been, found, in, the, archeological, sites, of, the, middle, east, and, subsequently, across, the, mediterranean, region, and, similar, arid, climates, with, cool, winters, california, produces, about, 80, of, the, world, s, almond, supply, due, to, high, acreage, and, water, demand, for, almond, cultivation, and, need, for, pesticides, california, almond, production, may, be, unsustainable, especially, during, the, persistent, drought, and, heat, from, climate, change, in, the, 21st, century, droughts, in, california, have, caused, some, producers, to, leave, the, industry, leading, to, lower, supply, and, increased, prices, the, almond, is, a, deciduous, tree, growing, to, 3, 4, 5, metres, 10, 15, feet, in, height, with, a, trunk, of, up, to, 30, centimetres, 12, inches, in, diameter, the, young, twigs, are, green, at, first, becoming, purplish, where, exposed, to, sunlight, then, gray, in, their, second, year, the, leaves, are, 8, 13, cm, 3, 5, in, long, with, a, serrated, margin, and, a, 2, 5, cm, 1, in, petiole, the, fragrant, flowers, are, white, to, pale, pink, 3, 5, cm, 1, 2, in, diameter, with, five, petals, produced, singly, or, in, pairs, and, appearing, before, the, leaves, in, early, spring, almond, trees, thrive, in, mediterranean, climates, with, warm, dry, summers, and, mild, wet, winters, the, optimal, temperature, for, their, growth, is, between, 15, and, 30, c, 59, and, 86, f, and, the, tree, buds, have, a, chilling, requirement, of, 200, to, 700, hours, below, 7, 2, c, 45, 0, f, to, break, dormancy, almonds, begin, bearing, an, economic, crop, in, the, third, year, after, planting, trees, reach, full, bearing, five, to, six, years, after, planting, the, fruit, matures, in, the, autumn, 7, 8, months, after, flowering, the, almond, fruit, is, 3, 5, 6, cm, 1, 3, 8, 2, 3, 8, in, long, it, is, not, a, nut, but, a, drupe, the, outer, covering, consisting, of, an, outer, exocarp, or, skin, and, mesocarp, or, flesh, fleshy, in, other, members, of, prunus, such, as, the, plum, and, cherry, is, instead, a, thick, leathery, gray, green, coat, with, a, downy, exterior, called, the, hull, inside, the, hull, is, a, woody, endocarp, which, forms, a, reticulated, hard, shell, like, the, outside, of, a, peach, pit, called, the, pyrena, inside, the, shell, is, the, edible, seed, commonly, called, a, nut, generally, one, seed, is, present, but, occasionally, two, occur, after, the, fruit, matures, the, hull, splits, and, separates, from, the, shell, and, an, abscission, layer, forms, between, the, stem, and, the, fruit, so, that, the, fruit, can, fall, from, the, tree, during, harvest, mechanized, tree, shakers, are, used, to, expedite, fruits, falling, to, the, ground, for, collection, the, seeds, of, prunus, dulcis, var, dulcis, are, predominantly, sweet, but, some, individual, trees, produce, seeds, that, are, somewhat, more, bitter, the, genetic, basis, for, bitterness, involves, a, single, gene, the, bitter, flavor, furthermore, being, recessive, both, aspects, making, this, trait, easier, to, domesticate, the, fruits, from, prunus, dulcis, var, amara, are, always, bitter, as, are, the, kernels, from, other, species, of, genus, prunus, such, as, apricot, peach, and, cherry, although, to, a, lesser, extent, the, bitter, almond, is, slightly, broader, and, shorter, than, the, sweet, almond, and, contains, about, 50, of, the, fixed, oil, that, occurs, in, sweet, almonds, it, also, contains, the, enzyme, emulsin, which, in, the, presence, of, water, acts, on, the, two, soluble, glucosides, amygdalin, and, prunasin, yielding, glucose, cyanide, and, the, essential, oil, of, bitter, almonds, which, is, nearly, pure, benzaldehyde, the, chemical, causing, the, bitter, flavor, bitter, almonds, may, yield, 4, 9, milligrams, of, hydrogen, cyanide, per, almond, and, contain, 42, times, higher, amounts, of, cyanide, than, the, trace, levels, found, in, sweet, almonds, the, origin, of, cyanide, content, in, bitter, almonds, is, via, the, enzymatic, hydrolysis, of, amygdalin, p450, monooxygenases, are, involved, in, the, amygdalin, biosynthetic, pathway, a, point, mutation, in, a, bhlh, transcription, factor, prevents, transcription, of, the, two, cytochrome, p450, genes, resulting, in, the, sweet, kernel, trait, the, word, almond, is, a, loanword, from, old, french, almande, or, alemande, descended, from, late, latin, amandula, amindula, modified, from, classical, latin, amygdala, which, is, in, turn, borrowed, from, ancient, greek, amygd, l, cf, amygdala, an, almond, shaped, portion, of, the, brain, late, old, english, had, amygdales, almonds, the, adjective, amygdaloid, literally, like, an, almond, almond, like, is, used, to, describe, objects, which, are, roughly, almond, shaped, particularly, a, shape, which, is, part, way, between, a, triangle, and, an, ellipse, for, example, the, amygdala, of, the, brain, uses, a, direct, borrowing, of, the, greek, term, amygdal, the, precise, origin, of, the, almond, is, controversial, due, to, estimates, for, its, emergence, across, wide, geographic, regions, sources, indicate, that, its, origins, were, in, central, asia, between, iran, turkmenistan, tajikistan, kurdistan, afghanistan, and, iraq, or, in, an, eastern, asian, subregion, between, mongolia, and, uzbekistan, in, other, assessments, both, botanical, and, archaeological, evidence, indicates, that, almonds, originated, and, were, first, cultivated, in, west, asia, particularly, in, countries, of, the, levant, other, estimates, specified, iran, and, anatolia, present, day, turkey, as, origin, locations, of, the, almond, with, botanical, evidence, for, iran, as, a, possible, origin, center, the, wild, form, of, domesticated, almond, also, grew, in, parts, of, the, levant, almond, cultivation, was, spread, by, humans, centuries, ago, along, the, shores, of, the, mediterranean, sea, into, northern, africa, and, southern, europe, and, more, recently, to, other, world, regions, notably, california, selection, of, the, sweet, type, from, the, many, bitter, types, in, the, wild, marked, the, beginning, of, almond, domestication, the, wild, ancestor, of, the, almond, used, to, breed, the, domesticated, species, is, unknown, the, species, prunus, fenzliana, may, be, the, most, likely, wild, ancestor, of, the, almond, in, part, because, it, is, native, to, armenia, and, western, azerbaijan, where, it, was, apparently, domesticated, wild, almond, species, were, grown, by, early, farmers, at, first, unintentionally, in, the, garbage, heaps, and, later, intentionally, in, their, orchards, almonds, were, one, of, the, earliest, domesticated, fruit, trees, due, to, the, ability, of, the, grower, to, raise, attractive, almonds, from, seed, thus, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, this, plant, does, not, lend, itself, to, propagation, from, suckers, or, from, cuttings, it, could, have, been, domesticated, even, before, the, introduction, of, grafting, domesticated, almonds, appear, in, the, early, bronze, age, 3000, 2000, bc, such, as, the, archaeological, sites, of, numeira, jordan, or, possibly, earlier, another, well, known, archaeological, example, of, the, almond, is, the, fruit, found, in, tutankhamun, s, tomb, in, egypt, c, 1325, bc, probably, imported, from, the, levant, an, article, on, almond, tree, cultivation, in, spain, is, brought, down, in, ibn, al, awwam, s, 12th, century, agricultural, work, book, on, agriculture, of, the, european, countries, that, the, royal, botanic, garden, edinburgh, reported, as, cultivating, almonds, germany, is, the, northernmost, though, the, domesticated, form, can, be, found, as, far, north, as, iceland, almond, trees, are, small, to, medium, sized, but, commercial, cultivars, can, be, grafted, onto, a, different, root, stock, to, produce, smaller, trees, varieties, include, breeding, programmes, have, found, the, high, shell, seal, trait, the, most, widely, planted, varieties, of, almond, are, self, incompatible, hence, these, trees, require, pollen, from, a, tree, with, different, genetic, characters, to, produce, seeds, almond, orchards, therefore, must, grow, mixtures, of, almond, varieties, in, addition, the, pollen, is, transferred, from, flower, to, flower, by, insects, therefore, commercial, growers, must, ensure, there, are, enough, insects, to, perform, this, task, the, large, scale, of, almond, production, in, the, u, s, creates, a, significant, problem, of, providing, enough, pollinating, insects, additional, pollinating, insects, are, therefore, brought, to, the, trees, the, pollination, of, california, s, almonds, is, the, largest, annual, managed, pollination, event, in, the, world, with, over, 1, million, hives, nearly, half, of, all, beehives, in, the, us, being, brought, to, the, almond, orchards, each, february, much, of, the, supply, of, bees, is, managed, by, pollination, brokers, who, contract, with, migratory, beekeepers, from, at, least, 49, states, for, the, event, this, business, was, heavily, affected, by, colony, collapse, disorder, at, the, turn, of, the, 21st, century, causing, a, nationwide, shortage, of, honey, bees, and, increasing, the, price, of, insect, pollination, to, partially, protect, almond, growers, from, these, costs, researchers, at, the, agricultural, research, service, part, of, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, usda, developed, self, pollinating, almond, trees, that, combine, this, character, with, quality, characters, such, as, a, flavor, and, yield, self, pollinating, almond, varieties, exist, but, they, lack, some, commercial, characters, however, through, natural, hybridisation, between, different, almond, varieties, a, new, variety, that, was, self, pollinating, with, a, high, yield, of, commercial, quality, nuts, was, produced, almond, trees, can, be, attacked, by, an, array, of, damaging, microbes, fungal, pathogens, plant, viruses, and, bacteria, pavement, ants, tetramorium, caespitum, southern, fire, ants, solenopsis, xyloni, and, thief, ants, solenopsis, molesta, are, seed, predators, bryobia, rubrioculus, mites, are, most, known, for, their, damage, to, this, crop, almond, production, in, california, is, concentrated, mainly, in, the, central, valley, where, the, mild, climate, rich, soil, abundant, sunshine, and, water, supply, make, for, ideal, growing, conditions, due, to, the, persistent, droughts, in, california, in, the, early, 21st, century, it, became, more, difficult, to, raise, almonds, in, a, sustainable, manner, the, issue, is, complex, because, of, the, high, amount, of, water, needed, to, produce, almonds, a, single, almond, requires, roughly, 1, 1, us, gallons, 0, 92, imperial, gallons, 4, 2, litres, of, water, to, grow, properly, regulations, related, to, water, supplies, are, changing, so, some, growers, have, destroyed, their, current, almond, orchards, to, replace, with, either, younger, trees, or, a, different, crop, such, as, pistachio, that, needs, less, water, sustainability, strategies, implemented, by, the, almond, board, of, california, and, almond, farmers, include, in, 2022, world, production, of, almonds, was, 3, 6, million, tonnes, led, by, the, united, states, table, secondary, producers, were, australia, and, spain, in, the, united, states, production, is, concentrated, in, california, where, 1, 000, 000, acres, 400, 000, ha, and, six, different, almond, varieties, were, under, cultivation, in, 2017, with, a, yield, of, 2, 25, billion, pounds, 1, 02, billion, kilograms, of, shelled, almonds, california, production, is, marked, by, a, period, of, intense, pollination, during, late, winter, by, rented, commercial, bees, transported, by, truck, across, the, u, s, to, almond, groves, requiring, more, than, half, of, the, total, u, s, commercial, honeybee, population, the, value, of, total, u, s, exports, of, shelled, almonds, in, 2016, was, 3, 2, billion, all, commercially, grown, almonds, sold, as, food, in, the, u, s, are, sweet, cultivars, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, reported, in, 2010, that, some, fractions, of, imported, sweet, almonds, were, contaminated, with, bitter, almonds, which, contain, cyanide, australia, is, the, largest, almond, production, region, in, the, southern, hemisphere, most, of, the, almond, orchards, are, located, along, the, murray, river, corridor, in, new, south, wales, victoria, and, south, australia, spain, has, diverse, commercial, cultivars, of, almonds, grown, in, catalonia, valencia, murcia, andalusia, and, arag, n, regions, and, the, balearic, islands, production, in, 2016, declined, 2, nationally, compared, to, 2015, production, data, the, marcona, almond, cultivar, is, recognizably, different, from, other, almonds, and, is, marketed, by, name, the, kernel, is, short, round, relatively, sweet, and, delicate, in, texture, its, origin, is, unknown, and, has, been, grown, in, spain, for, a, long, time, the, tree, is, very, productive, and, the, shell, of, the, nut, is, hard, bitter, almonds, contain, 42, times, higher, amounts, of, cyanide, than, the, trace, levels, found, in, sweet, almonds, extract, of, bitter, almond, was, once, used, medicinally, but, even, in, small, doses, effects, are, severe, or, lethal, especially, in, children, the, cyanide, must, be, removed, before, consumption, the, acute, oral, lethal, dose, of, cyanide, for, adult, humans, is, reported, to, be, 0, 5, 3, 5, mg, kg, 0, 2, 1, 6, mg, lb, of, body, weight, approximately, 50, bitter, almonds, so, that, for, children, consuming, 5, 10, bitter, almonds, may, be, fatal, symptoms, of, eating, such, almonds, include, vertigo, and, other, typical, cyanide, poisoning, effects, almonds, may, cause, allergy, or, intolerance, cross, reactivity, is, common, with, peach, allergens, lipid, transfer, proteins, and, tree, nut, allergens, symptoms, range, from, local, signs, and, symptoms, e, g, oral, allergy,

aflatoxin, producing, molds, aflatoxins, are, potent, carcinogenic, chemicals, produced, by, molds, such, as, aspergillus, flavus, and, aspergillus, parasiticus, the, mold, contamination, may, occur, from, soil, previously, infested, almonds, and, almond, pests, such, as, navel, orange, worm, high, levels, of, mold, growth, typically, appear, as, gray, to, black, filament, like, growth, it, is, unsafe, to, eat, mold, infected, tree, nuts, some, countries, have, strict, limits, on, allowable, levels, of, aflatoxin, contamination, of, almonds, and, require, adequate, testing, before, the, nuts, can, be, marketed, to, their, citizens, the, european, union, for, example, introduced, a, requirement, since, 2007, that, all, almond, shipments, to, the, eu, be, tested, for, aflatoxin, if, aflatoxin, does, not, meet, the, strict, safety, regulations, the, entire, consignment, may, be, reprocessed, to, eliminate, the, aflatoxin, or, it, must, be, destroyed, breeding, programs, have, found, the, high, shell, seal, trait, high, shell, seal, provides, resistance, against, these, aspergillus, species, and, so, against, the, development, of, their, toxins, after, tracing, cases, of, salmonellosis, to, almonds, the, usda, approved, a, proposal, by, the, almond, board, of, california, to, pasteurize, almonds, sold, to, the, public, after, publishing, the, rule, in, march, 2007, the, almond, pasteurization, program, became, mandatory, for, california, companies, effective, 1, september, 2007, raw, untreated, california, almonds, have, not, been, available, in, the, u, s, since, then, california, almonds, labeled, raw, must, be, steam, pasteurized, or, chemically, treated, with, propylene, oxide, ppo, this, does, not, apply, to, imported, almonds, or, almonds, sold, from, the, grower, directly, to, the, consumer, in, small, quantities, the, treatment, also, is, not, required, for, raw, almonds, sold, for, export, outside, of, north, america, the, almond, board,

challenged, in, court, by, organic, farmers, organized, by, the, cornucopia, institute, a, wisconsin, based, farm, policy, research, group, which, filed, a, lawsuit, in, september, 2008, according, to, the, institute, this, almond, marketing, order, has, imposed, significant, financial, burdens, on, small, scale, and, organic, growers, and, damaged, domestic, almond, markets, a, federal, judge, dismissed, the, lawsuit, in, early, 2009, on, procedural, grounds, in, august, 2010, a, federal, appeals, court, ruled, that, the, farmers, have, a, right, to, appeal, the, usda, regulation, in, march, 2013, the, court, vacated, the, suit, on, the, basis, that, the, objections, should, have, been, raised, in, 2007, when, the, regulation, was, first, proposed, almonds, are, 4, water, 22,
