crabroniformis, syrphidae, bottom, left, holcocephala, fusca, asilidae, bottom, right, nematocera, paraphyletic, inc, eudiptera, brachycera, flies, are, insects, of, the, order, diptera, the, name, being, derived, from, the, greek, di, two, and, pteron, wing, insects, of, this, order, use, only, a, single, pair, of, wings, to, fly, the, hindwings, having, evolved, into, advanced, mechanosensory, organs, known, as, halteres, which, act, as, high, speed, sensors, of, rotational, movement, and, allow, dipterans, to, perform, advanced, aerobatics, diptera, is, a, large, order, containing, an, estimated, 1, 000, 000, species, including, horse, flies, crane, flies, hoverflies, mosquitoes, and, others, although, only, about, 125, 000, species, have, been, described, flies, have, a, mobile, head, with, a, pair, of, large, compound, eyes, and, mouthparts, designed, for, piercing, and, sucking, mosquitoes, black, flies, and, robber, flies, or, for, lapping, and, sucking, in, the, other, groups, their, wing, arrangement, gives, them, great, maneuverability, in, flight, and, claws, and, pads, on, their, feet, enable, them, to, cling, to, smooth, surfaces, flies, undergo, complete, metamorphosis, the, eggs, are, often, laid, on, the, larval, food, source, and, the, larvae, which, lack, true, limbs, develop, in, a, protected, environment, often, inside, their, food, source, other, species, are, ovoviviparous, opportunistically, depositing, hatched, or, hatching, larvae, instead, of, eggs, on, carrion, dung, decaying, material, or, open, wounds, of, mammals, the, pupa, is, a, tough, capsule, from, which, the, adult, emerges, when, ready, to, do, so, flies, mostly, have, short, lives, as, adults, diptera, is, one, of, the, major, insect, orders, and, of, considerable, ecological, and, human, importance, flies, are, important, pollinators, second, only, to, the, bees, and, their, hymenopteran, relatives, flies, may, have, been, among, the, evolutionarily, earliest, pollinators, responsible, for, early, plant, pollination, fruit, flies, are, used, as, model, organisms, in, research, but, less, benignly, mosquitoes, are, vectors, for, malaria, dengue, west, nile, fever, yellow, fever, encephalitis, and, other, infectious, diseases, and, houseflies, commensal, with, humans, all, over, the, world, spread, foodborne, illnesses, flies, can, be, annoyances, especially, in, some, parts, of, the, world, where, they, can, occur, in, large, numbers, buzzing, and, settling, on, the, skin, or, eyes, to, bite, or, seek, fluids, larger, flies, such, as, tsetse, flies, and, screwworms, cause, significant, economic, harm, to, cattle, blowfly, larvae, known, as, gentles, and, other, dipteran, larvae, known, more, generally, as, maggots, are, used, as, fishing, bait, as, food, for, carnivorous, animals, and, in, medicine, in, debridement, to, clean, wounds, dipterans, are, holometabolans, insects, that, undergo, radical, metamorphosis, they, belong, to, the, mecopterida, alongside, the, mecoptera, siphonaptera, lepidoptera, and, trichoptera, the, possession, of, a, single, pair, of, wings, distinguishes, most, true, flies, from, other, insects, with, fly, in, their, names, however, some, true, flies, such, as, hippoboscidae, louse, flies, have, become, secondarily, wingless, the, cladogram, represents, the, current, consensus, view, hymenoptera, sawflies, wasps, ants, bees, raphidioptera, snakeflies, megaloptera, alderflies, and, allies, neuroptera, lacewings, and, allies, coleoptera, beetles, strepsiptera, twisted, wing, parasites, trichoptera, caddisflies, lepidoptera, butterflies, moths, diptera, mecoptera, scorpionflies, siphonaptera, fleas, the, first, true, dipterans, known, are, from, the, middle, triassic, around, 240, million, years, ago, and, they, became, widespread, during, the, middle, and, late, triassic, modern, flowering, plants, did, not, appear, until, the, cretaceous, around, 140, million, years, ago, so, the, original, dipterans, must, have, had, a, different, source, of, nutrition, other, than, nectar, based, on, the, attraction, of, many, modern, fly, groups, to, shiny, droplets, it, has, been, suggested, that, they, may, have, fed, on, honeydew, produced, by, sap, sucking, bugs, which, were, abundant, at, the, time, and, dipteran, mouthparts, are, well, adapted, to, softening, and, lapping, up, the, crusted, residues, the, basal, clades, in, the, diptera, include, the, deuterophlebiidae, and, the, enigmatic, nymphomyiidae, three, episodes, of, evolutionary, radiation, are, thought, to, have, occurred, based, on, the, fossil, record, many, new, species, of, lower, diptera, developed, in, the, triassic, about, 220, million, years, ago, many, lower, brachycera, appeared, in, the, jurassic, some, 180, million, years, ago, a, third, radiation, took, place, among, the, schizophora, at, the, start, of, the, paleogene, 66, million, years, ago, the, phylogenetic, position, of, diptera, has, been, controversial, the, monophyly, of, holometabolous, insects, has, long, been, accepted, with, the, main, orders, being, established, as, lepidoptera, coleoptera, hymenoptera, and, diptera, and, it, is, the, relationships, between, these, groups, which, has, caused, difficulties, diptera, is, widely, thought, to, be, a, member, of, mecopterida, along, with, lepidoptera, butterflies, and, moths, trichoptera, caddisflies, siphonaptera, fleas, mecoptera, scorpionflies, and, possibly, strepsiptera, twisted, wing, flies, diptera, has, been, grouped, with, siphonaptera, and, mecoptera, in, the, antliophora, but, this, has, not, been, confirmed, by, molecular, studies, diptera, were, traditionally, broken, down, into, two, suborders, nematocera, and, brachycera, distinguished, by, the, differences, in, antennae, the, nematocera, are, identified, by, their, elongated, bodies, and, many, segmented, often, feathery, antennae, as, represented, by, mosquitoes, and, crane, flies, the, brachycera, have, rounder, bodies, and, much, shorter, antennae, subsequent, studies, have, identified, the, nematocera, as, being, non, monophyletic, with, modern, phylogenies, placing, the, brachycera, within, grades, of, groups, formerly, placed, in, the, nematocera, the, construction, of, a, phylogenetic, tree, has, been, the, subject, of, ongoing, research, the, following, cladogram, is, based, on, the, flytree, project, ptychopteromorpha, phantom, and, primitive, crane, flies, culicomorpha, mosquitoes, blackflies, and,

marsh, flies, etc, flies, are, often, abundant, and, are, found, in, almost, all, terrestrial, habitats, in, the, world, apart, from, antarctica, they, include, many, familiar, insects, such, as, house, flies, blow, flies, mosquitoes, gnats, black, flies, midges, and, fruit, flies, more, than, 150, 000, have, been, formally, described, and, the, actual, species, diversity, is, much, greater, with, the, flies, from, many, parts, of, the, world, yet, to, be, studied, intensively, the, suborder, nematocera, include, generally, small, slender, insects, with, long, antennae, such, as, mosquitoes, gnats, midges, and, crane, flies, while, the, brachycera, includes, broader, more, robust, flies, with, short, antennae, many, nematoceran, larvae, are, aquatic, there, are, estimated, to, be, a, total, of, about, 19, 000, species, of, diptera, in, europe, 22, 000, in, the, nearctic, region, 20, 000, in, the, afrotropical, region, 23, 000, in, the, oriental, region, and, 19, 000, in, the, australasian, region, while, most, species, have, restricted, distributions, a, few, like, the, housefly, musca, domestica, are, cosmopolitan, gauromydas, heros, asiloidea, with, a, length, of, up, to, 7, cm, 2, 8, in, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, largest, fly, in, the, world, while, the, smallest, is, euryplatea, nanaknihali, which, at, 0, 4, mm, 0, 016, in, is, smaller, than, a, grain, of, salt, brachycera, are, ecologically, very, diverse, with, many, being, predatory, at, the, larval, stage, and, some, being, parasitic, animals, parasitised, include, molluscs, woodlice, millipedes, insects, mammals, and, amphibians, flies, are, the, second, largest, group, of, pollinators, after, the, hymenoptera, bees, wasps, and, relatives, in, wet, and, colder, environments, flies, are, significantly, more, important, as, pollinators, compared, to, bees, they, need, less, food, as, they, do, not, need, to, provision, their, young, many, flowers, that, bear, low, nectar, and, those, that, have, evolved, trap, pollination, depend, on, flies, it, is, thought, that, some, of, the, earliest, pollinators, of, plants, may, have, been, flies, the, greatest, diversity, of, gall, forming, insects, are, found, among, the, flies, principally, in, the, family, cecidomyiidae, gall, midges, many, flies, most, importantly, in, the, family, agromyzidae, lay, their, eggs, in, the, mesophyll, tissue, of, leaves, with, larvae, feeding, between, the, surfaces, forming, blisters, and, mines, some, families, are, mycophagous, or, fungus, feeding, these, include, the, cave, dwelling, mycetophilidae, fungus, gnats, whose, larvae, are, the, only, diptera, with, bioluminescence, the, sciaridae, are, also, fungus, feeders, some, plants, are, pollinated, by, fungus, feeding, flies, that, visit, fungus, infected, male, flowers, the, larvae, of, megaselia, scalaris, phoridae, are, almost, omnivorous, and, consume, such, substances, as, paint, and, shoe, polish, the, exorista, mella, walker, fly, are, considered, generalists, and, parasitoids, of, a, variety, of, hosts, the, larvae, of, the, shore, flies, ephydridae, and, some, chironomidae, survive, in, extreme, environments, including, glaciers, diamesa, sp, chironomidae, hot, springs, geysers, saline, pools, sulphur, pools, septic, tanks, and, even, crude, oil, helaeomyia, petrolei, adult, hoverflies, syrphidae, are, well, known, for, their, mimicry, and, the, larvae, adopt, diverse, lifestyles, including, being, inquiline, scavengers, inside, the, nests, of, social, insects, some, brachycerans, are, agricultural, pests, some, bite, animals, and, humans, and, suck, their, blood, and, some, transmit, diseases, flies, are, adapted, for, aerial, movement, and, typically, have, short, and, streamlined, bodies, the, first, tagma, of, the, fly, the, head, bears, the, eyes, the, antennae, and, the, mouthparts, the, labrum, labium, mandible, and, maxilla, make, up, the, mouthparts, the, second, tagma, the, thorax, bears, the, wings, and, contains, the, flight, muscles, on, the, second, segment, which, is, greatly, enlarged, the, first, and, third, segments, have, been, reduced, to, collar, like, structures, and, the, third, segment, bears, the, halteres, which, help, to, balance, the, insect, during, flight, the, third, tagma, is, the, abdomen, consisting, of, 11, segments, some, of, which, may, be, fused, and, with, the, 3, hindmost, segments, modified, for, reproduction, some, dipterans, are, mimics, and, can, only, be, distinguished, from, their, models, by, very, careful, inspection, an, example, of, this, is, spilomyia, longicornis, which, is, a, fly, but, mimics, a, vespid, wasp, flies, have, a, mobile, head, with, a, pair, of, large, compound, eyes, on, the, sides, of, the, head, and, in, most, species, three, small, ocelli, on, the, top, the, compound, eyes, may, be, close, together, or, widely, separated, and, in, some, instances, are, divided, into, a, dorsal, region, and, a, ventral, region, perhaps, to, assist, in, swarming, behaviour, the, antennae, are, well, developed, but, variable, being, thread, like, feathery, or, comb, like, in, the, different, families, the, mouthparts, are, adapted, for, piercing, and, sucking, as, in, the, black, flies, mosquitoes, and, robber, flies, and, for, lapping, and, sucking, as, in, many, other, groups, female, horse, flies, use, knife, like, mandibles, and, maxillae, to, make, a, cross, shaped, incision, in, the, host, s, skin, and, then, lap, up, the, blood, that, flows, the, gut, includes, large, diverticulae, allowing, the, insect, to, store, small, quantities, of, liquid, after, a, meal, for, visual, course, control, flies, optic, flow, field, is, analyzed, by, a, set, of, motion, sensitive, neurons, a, subset, of, these, neurons, is, thought, to, be, involved, in, using, the, optic, flow, to, estimate, the, parameters, of, self, motion, such, as, yaw, roll, and, sideward, translation, other, neurons, are, thought, to, be, involved, in, analyzing, the, content, of, the, visual, scene, itself, such, as, separating, figures, from, the, ground, using, motion, parallax, the, h1, neuron, is, responsible, for, detecting, horizontal, motion, across, the, entire, visual, field, of, the, fly, allowing, the, fly, to, generate, and, guide, stabilizing, motor, corrections, midflight, with, respect, to, yaw, the, ocelli, are, concerned, in, the, detection, of, changes, in, light, intensity, enabling, the, fly, to, react, swiftly, to, the, approach, of, an, object, like, other, insects, flies, have, chemoreceptors, that, detect, smell, and, taste, and, mechanoreceptors, that, respond, to, touch, the, third, segments, of, the, antennae, and, the, maxillary, palps, bear, the, main, olfactory, receptors, while, the, gustatory, receptors, are, in, the, labium, pharynx, feet, wing, margins, and, female, genitalia, enabling, flies, to, taste, their, food, by, walking, on, it, the, taste, receptors, in, females, at, the, tip, of, the, abdomen, receive, information, on, the, suitability, of, a, site, for, ovipositing, flies, that, feed, on, blood, have, special, sensory, structures, that, can, detect, infrared, emissions, and, use, them, to, home, in, on, their, hosts, many, blood, sucking, flies, can, detect, the, raised, concentration, of, carbon, dioxide, that, occurs, near, large, animals, some, tachinid, flies, ormiinae, which, are, parasitoids, of, bush, crickets, have, sound, receptors, to, help, them, locate, their, singing, hosts, diptera, have, one, pair, of, fore, wings, on, the, mesothorax, and, a, pair, of, halteres, or, reduced, hind, wings, on, the, metathorax, a, further, adaptation, for, flight, is, the, reduction, in, number, of, the, neural, ganglia, and, concentration, of, nerve, tissue, in, the, thorax, a, feature, that, is, most, extreme, in, the, highly, derived, muscomorpha, infraorder, some, flies, such, as, the, ectoparasitic, nycteribiidae, and, streblidae, are, exceptional, in, having, lost, their, wings, and, become, flightless, the, only, other, order, of, insects, bearing, a, single, pair, of, true, functional, wings, in, addition, to, any, form, of, halteres, are, the, strepsiptera, in, contrast, to, the, flies, the, strepsiptera, bear, their, halteres, on, the, mesothorax, and, their, flight, wings, on, the, metathorax, each, of, the, fly, s, six, legs, has, a, typical, insect, structure, of, coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, and, tarsus, with, the, tarsus, in, most, instances, being, subdivided, into, five, tarsomeres, at, the, tip, of, the, limb, is, a, pair, of, claws, and, between, these, are, cushion, like, structures, known, as, pulvilli, which, provide, adhesion, the, abdomen, shows, considerable, variability, among, members, of, the, order, it, consists, of, eleven, segments, in, primitive, groups, and, ten, segments, in, more, derived, groups, the, tenth, and, eleventh, segments, having, fused, the, last, two, or, three, segments, are, adapted, for, reproduction, each, segment, is, made, up, of, a, dorsal, and, a, ventral, sclerite, connected, by, an, elastic, membrane, in, some, females, the, sclerites, are, rolled, into, a, flexible, telescopic, ovipositor, flies, are, capable, of, great, manoeuvrability, during, flight, due, to, the, presence, of, the, halteres, these, act, as, gyroscopic, organs, and, are, rapidly, oscillated, in, time, with, the, wings, they, act, as, a, balance, and, guidance, system, by, providing, rapid, feedback, to, the, wing, steering, muscles, and, flies, deprived, of, their, halteres, are, unable, to, fly, the, wings, and, halteres, move, in, synchrony, but, the, amplitude, of, each, wing, beat, is, independent, allowing, the, fly, to, turn, sideways, the, wings, of, the, fly, are, attached, to, two, kinds, of, muscles, those, used, to, power, it, and, another, set, used, for, fine, control, flies, tend, to, fly, in, a, straight, line, then, make, a, rapid, change, in, direction, before, continuing, on, a, different, straight, path, the, directional, changes, are, called, saccades, and, typically, involve, an, angle, of, 90, being, achieved, in, 50, milliseconds, they, are, initiated, by, visual, stimuli, as, the, fly, observes, an, object, nerves, then, activate, steering, muscles, in, the, thorax, that, cause, a, small, change, in, wing, stroke, which, generate, sufficient, torque, to, turn, detecting, this, within, four, or, five, wingbeats, the, halteres, trigger, a, counter, turn, and, the, fly, heads, off, in, a, new, direction, flies, have, rapid, reflexes, that, aid, their, escape, from, predators, but, their, sustained, flight, speeds, are, low, dolichopodid, flies, in, the, genus, condylostylus, respond, in, less, than, 5, milliseconds, to, camera, flashes, by, taking, flight, in, the, past, the, deer, bot, fly, cephenemyia, was, claimed, to, be, one, of, the, fastest, insects, on, the, basis, of, an, estimate, made, visually, by, charles, townsend, in, 1927, this, claim, of, speeds, of, 600, to, 800, miles, per, hour, was, regularly, repeated, until, it, was, shown, to, be, physically, impossible, as, well, as, incorrect, by, irving, langmuir, langmuir, suggested, an, estimated, speed, of, 25, miles, per, hour, although, most, flies, live, and, fly, close, to, the, ground, a, few, are, known, to, fly, at, heights, and, a, few, like, oscinella, chloropidae, are, known, to, be, dispersed, by, winds, at, altitudes, of, up, to, 2000, ft, and, over, long, distances, some, hover, flies, like, metasyrphus, corollae, have, been, known, to, undertake, long, flights, in, response, to, aphid, population, spurts, males, of, fly, species, such, as, cuterebra, many, hover, flies, bee, flies, bombyliidae, and, fruit, flies, tephritidae, maintain, territories, within, which, they, engage, in, aerial, pursuit, to, drive, away, intruding, males, and, other, species, while, these, territories, may, be, held, by, individual, males, some, species, such, as, a, freeborni, form, leks, with, many, males, aggregating, in, displays, some, flies, maintain, an, airspace, and, still, others, form, dense, swarms, that, maintain, a, stationary, location, with, respect, to, landmarks, many, flies, mate, in, flight, while, swarming, diptera, go, through, a, complete, metamorphosis, with, four, distinct, life, stages, egg, larva, pupa, and, adult, in, many, flies, the, larval, stage, is, long, and, adults, may, have, a, short, life, most, dipteran, larvae, develop, in, protected, environments, many, are, aquatic, and, others, are, found, in, moist, places, such, as, carrion, fruit, vegetable, matter, fungi, and, in, the, case, of, parasitic, species, inside, their, hosts, they, tend, to, have, thin, cuticles, and, become, desiccated, if, exposed, to, the, air, apart, from, the, brachycera, most, dipteran, larvae, have, sclerotised, head, capsules, which, may, be, reduced, to, remnant, mouth, hooks, the, brachycera, however, have, soft, gelatinized, head, capsules, from, which, the, sclerites, are, reduced, or, missing, many, of, these, larvae, retract, their, heads, into, their, thorax, the, spiracles, in, the, larva, and, pupa, do, not, have, any, internal, mechanical, closing, device, some, other, anatomical, distinction, exists, between, the, larvae, of, the, nematocera, and, the, brachycera, especially, in, the, brachycera, little, demarcation, is, seen, between, the, thorax, and, abdomen, though, the, demarcation, may, be, visible, in, many, nematocera, such, as, mosquitoes, in, the, brachycera, the, head, of, the, larva, is, not, clearly, distinguishable, from, the, rest, of, the, body, and, few, if, any, sclerites, are, present, informally, such, brachyceran, larvae, are, called, maggots, but, the, term, is, not, technical, and, often, applied, indifferently, to, fly, larvae, or, insect, larvae, in, general, the, eyes, and, antennae, of, brachyceran, larvae, are, reduced, or, absent, and, the, abdomen, also, lacks, appendages, such, as, cerci, this, lack, of, features, is, an, adaptation, to, food, such, as, carrion, decaying, detritus, or, host, tissues, surrounding, endoparasites, nematoceran, larvae, generally, have, well, developed, eyes, and, antennae, while, those, of, brachyceran, larvae, are, reduced, or, modified, dipteran, larvae, have, no, jointed, true, legs, but, some, dipteran, larvae, such, as, species, of, simuliidae, tabanidae, and, vermileonidae, have, prolegs, adapted, to, hold, onto, a, substrate, in, flowing, water, host, tissues, or, prey, the, majority, of, dipterans, are, oviparous, and, lay, batches, of, eggs, but, some, species, are, ovoviviparous, where, the, larvae, starting, development, inside, the, eggs, before, they, hatch, or, viviparous, the, larvae, hatching, and, maturing, in, the, body, of, the, mother, before, being, externally, deposited, these, are, found, especially, in, groups, that, have, larvae, dependent, on, food, sources, that, are, short, lived, or, are, accessible, for, brief, periods, this, is, widespread, in, some, families, such, as, the, sarcophagidae, in, hylemya, strigosa, anthomyiidae, the, larva, moults, to, the, second, instar, before, hatching, and, in, termitoxenia, phoridae, females, have, incubation, pouches, and, a, full, developed, third, instar, larva, is, deposited, by, the, adult, and, it, almost, immediately, pupates, with, no, freely, feeding, larval, stage, the, tsetse, fly, as, well, as, other, glossinidae, hippoboscidae, nycteribidae, and, streblidae, exhibits, adenotrophic, viviparity, a, single, fertilised, egg, is, retained, in, the, oviduct, and, the, developing, larva, feeds, on, glandular, secretions, when, fully, grown, the, female, finds, a, spot, with, soft, soil, and, the, larva, works, its, way, out, of, the, oviduct, buries, itself, and, pupates, some, flies, like, lundstroemia, parthenogenetica, chironomidae, reproduce, by, thelytokous, parthenogenesis, and, some, gall, midges, have, larvae, that, can, produce, eggs, paedogenesis, the, pupae, take, various, forms, in, some, groups, particularly, the, nematocera, the, pupa, is, intermediate, between, the, larval, and, adult, form, these, pupae, are, described, as, obtect, having, the, future, appendages, visible, as, structures, that, adhere, to, the, pupal, body, the, outer, surface, of, the, pupa, may, be, leathery, and, bear, spines, respiratory, features, or, locomotory, paddles, in, other, groups, described, as, coarctate, the, appendages, are, not, visible, in, these, the, outer, surface, is, a, puparium, formed, from, the, last, larval, skin, and, the, actual, pupa, is, concealed, within, when, the, adult, insect, is, ready, to, emerge, from, this, tough, desiccation, resistant, capsule, it, inflates, a, balloon, like, structure, on, its, head, and, forces, its, way, out, the, adult, stage, is, usually, short, its, function, is, only, to, mate, and, lay, eggs, the, genitalia, of, male, flies, are, rotated, to, a, varying, degree, from, the, position, found, in, other, insects, in, some, flies, this, is, a, temporary, rotation, during, mating, but, in, others, it, is, a, permanent, torsion, of, the, organs, that, occurs, during, the, pupal, stage, this, torsion, may, lead, to, the, anus, being, below, the, genitals, or, in, the, case, of, 360, torsion, to, the, sperm, duct, being, wrapped, around, the, gut, and, the, external, organs, being, in, their, usual, position, when, flies, mate, the, male, initially, flies, on, top, of, the, female, facing, in, the, same, direction, but, then, turns, around, to, face, in, the, opposite, direction, this, forces, the, male, to, lie, on, his, back, for, his, genitalia, to, remain, engaged, with, those, of, the, female, or, the, torsion, of, the, male, genitals, allows, the, male, to, mate, while, remaining, upright, this, leads, to, flies, having, more, reproduction, abilities, than, most, insects, and, much, quicker, flies, occur, in, large, populations, due, to, their, ability, to, mate, effectively, and, quickly, during, the, mating, season, more, primitive, groups, mates, in, the, air, during, swarming, but, most, of, the, more, advanced, species, with, a, 360, torsion, mate, on, a, substrate, as, ubiquitous, insects, dipterans, play, an, important, role, at, various, trophic, levels, both, as, consumers, and, as, prey, in, some, groups, the, larvae, complete, their, development, without, feeding, and, in, others, the, adults, do, not, feed, the, larvae, can, be, herbivores, scavengers, decomposers, predators, or, parasites, with, the, consumption, of, decaying, organic, matter, being, one, of, the, most, prevalent, feeding, behaviours, the, fruit, or, detritus, is, consumed, along, with, the, associated, micro, organisms, a, sieve, like, filter, in, the, pharynx, being, used, to, concentrate, the, particles, while, flesh, eating, larvae, have, mouth, hooks, to, help, shred, their, food, the, larvae, of, some, groups, feed, on, or, in, the, living, tissues, of, plants, and, fungi, and, some, of, these, are, serious, pests, of, agricultural, crops, some, aquatic, larvae, consume, the, films, of, algae, that, form, underwater, on, rocks, and, plants, many, of, the, parasitoid, larvae, grow, inside, and, eventually, kill, other, arthropods, while, parasitic, larvae, may, attack, vertebrate, hosts, whereas, many, dipteran, larvae, are, aquatic, or, live, in, enclosed, terrestrial, locations, the, majority, of, adults, live, above, ground, and, are, capable, of, flight, predominantly, they, feed, on, nectar, or, plant, or, animal, exudates, such, as, honeydew, for, which, their, lapping, mouthparts, are, adapted, some, flies, have, functional, mandibles, that, may, be, used, for, biting, the, flies, that, feed, on, vertebrate, blood, have, sharp, stylets, that, pierce, the, skin, with, some, species, having, anticoagulant, saliva, that, is, regurgitated, before, absorbing, the, blood, that, flows, in, this, process, certain, diseases, can, be, transmitted, the, bot, flies, oestridae, have, evolved, to, parasitize, mammals, many, species, complete, their, life, cycle, inside, the, bodies, of, their, hosts, the, larvae, of, a, few, fly, groups, agromyzidae, anthomyiidae, cecidomyiidae, are, capable, of, inducing, plant, galls, some, dipteran, larvae, are, leaf, miners, the, larvae, of, many, brachyceran, families, are, predaceous, in, many, dipteran, groups, swarming, is, a, feature, of, adult, life, with, clouds, of, insects, gathering, in, certain, locations, these, insects, are, mostly, males, and, the, swarm, may, serve, the, purpose, of, making, their, location, more, visible, to, females, most, adult, diptera, have, their, mouthparts, modified, to, sponge, up, fluid, the, adults, of, many, species, of, flies, e, g, anthomyia, sp, steganopsis, melanogaster, that, feed, on, liquid, food, will, regurgitate, fluid, in, a, behaviour, termed, as, bubbling, which, has, been, thought, to, help, the, insects, evaporate, water, and, concentrate, food, or, possibly, to, cool, by, evaporation, some, adult, diptera, are, known, for, kleptoparasitism, such, as, members, of, the, sarcophagidae, the, miltogramminae, are, known, as, satellite, flies, for, their, habit, of, following, wasps, and, stealing, their, stung, prey, or, laying, their, eggs, into, them, phorids, milichids, and, the, genus, bengalia, are, known, to, steal, food, carried, by, ants, adults, of, ephydra, hians, forage, underwater, and, have, special, hydrophobic, hairs, that, trap, a, bubble, of, air, that, lets, them, breathe, underwater, flies, are, eaten, by, other, animals, at, all, stages, of, their, development, the, eggs, and, larvae, are, parasitised, by, other, insects, and, are, eaten, by, many, creatures, some, of, which, specialise, in, feeding, on, flies, but, most, of, which, consume, them, as, part, of, a, mixed, diet, birds, bats, frogs, lizards, dragonflies, and, spiders, are, among, the, predators, of, flies, many, flies, have, evolved, mimetic, resemblances, that, aid, their, protection, batesian, mimicry, is, widespread, with, many, hoverflies, resembling, bees, and, wasps, ants, and, some, species, of, tephritid, fruit, fly, resembling, spiders, some, species, of, hoverfly, are, myrmecophilous, their, young, live, and, grow, within, the, nests, of, ants, they, are, protected, from, the, ants, by, imitating, chemical, odours, given, by, ant, colony, members, bombyliid, bee, flies, such, as, bombylius, major, are, short, bodied, round, furry, and, distinctly, bee, like, as, they, visit, flowers, for, nectar, and, are, likely, also, batesian, mimics, of, bees, in, contrast, drosophila, subobscura, a, species, of, fly, in, the, genus, drosophila, lacks, a, category, of, hemocytes, that, are,

roles, in, different, cultures, these, include, both, positive, and, negative, roles, in, religion, in, the, traditional, navajo, religion, big, fly, is, an, important, spirit, being, in, christian, demonology, beelzebub, is, a, demonic, fly, the, lord, of, the, flies, and, a, god, of, the, philistines, flies, have, appeared, in, literature, since, ancient, sumer, in, a, sumerian, poem, a, fly, helps, the, goddess, inanna, when, her, husband, dumuzid, is, being, chased, by, galla, demons, in, the, mesopotamian, versions, of, the, flood, myth, the, dead, corpses, floating, on, the, waters, are, compared, to, flies, later, the, gods, are, said, to, swarm, like, flies, around, the, hero, utnapishtim, s, offering, flies, appear, on, old, babylonian, seals, as, symbols, of, nergal, the, god, of, death, fly, shaped, lapis, lazuli, beads, were, often, worn, in, ancient, mesopotamia, along, with, other, kinds, of, fly, jewellery, in, ancient, egypt, flies, appear, in, amulets, and, as, a, military, award, for, bravery, and, tenacity, due, to, the, fact, that, they, always, come, back, when, swatted, at, it, is, thought, that, flies, may, have, also, been, associated, with, the, departing, spirit, of, the, dead, as, they, are, often, found, near, dead, bodies, in, modern, egypt, a, similar, belief, persists, in, some, areas, to, not, swat, at, shiny, green, flies, as, they, may, be, carrying, the, soul, of, a, recently, deceased, person, in, a, little, known, greek, myth, a, very, chatty, and, talkative, maiden, named, myia, meaning, fly, enraged, the, moon, goddess, selene, by, attempting, to, seduce, her, lover, the, sleeping, endymion, and, was, thus, turned, by, the, angry, goddess, into, a, fly, who, now, always, deprives, people, of, their, sleep, in,

various, paintings, this, feature, was, widespread, in, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, paintings, and, its, presence, may, be, explained, by, various, reasons, flies, appear, in, popular, culture, in, concepts, such, as, fly, on, the, wall, documentary, making, in, film, and, television, production, the, metaphoric, name, suggests, that, events, are, seen, candidly, as, a, fly, might, see, them,

parasitoids, of, other, insects, helping, to, control, a, variety, of, pests, many, dipterans, such, as, bee, flies, bombyliidae, and, hoverflies, syrphidae, are, pollinators, of, crop, plants, drosophila, melanogaster, a, fruit, fly, has, long, been, used, as, a, model, organism, in, research, because, of, the, ease, with, which, it, can, be, bred, and, reared, in, the, laboratory, its, small, genome, and, the, fact, that, many, of, its, genes, have, counterparts, in, higher, eukaryotes, a, large, number, of, genetic, studies, have, been, undertaken, based, on, this, species, these, have, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, study, of, gene, expression, gene, regulatory, mechanisms, and, mutation, other, studies, have, investigated, physiology, microbial, pathogenesis, and, development, among, other, research, topics, the, studies, on, dipteran, relationships, by, willi, hennig, helped, in, the, development, of, cladistics, techniques, that, he, applied, to, morphological, characters, but, now, adapted, for, use, with, molecular, sequences, in, phylogenetics, maggots, found, on, corpses, are, useful, to, forensic, entomologists, maggot, species, can, be,

death, of, the, victim, and, so, do, their, predators, such, as, beetles, in, the, family, histeridae, thus, the, presence, or, absence, of, particular, species, provides, evidence, for, the, time, since, death, and, sometimes, other, details, such, as, the, place, of, death, when, species, are, confined, to, particular, habitats, such, as, woodland, some, species, of, maggots, such, as, blowfly, larvae, gentles, and, bluebottle, larvae, casters, are, bred, commercially, they, are, sold, as, bait, in, angling, and, as, food, for, carnivorous, animals, kept, as, pets, in, zoos, or, for, research, such, as, some, mammals, fishes, reptiles, and, birds, it, has, been, suggested, that, fly, larvae, could, be, used, at, a, large, scale, as, food, for, farmed, chickens, pigs, and, fish, however, consumers, are, opposed, to, the, inclusion, of, insects, in, their, food, and, the, use, of, insects, in, animal, feed, remains, illegal, in, areas, such, as, the, european, union, fly, larvae, can, be, used, as, a, biomedical, tool, for, wound, care, and, treatment, maggot, debridement, therapy, mdt, is, the, use, of, blow, fly, larvae, to, remove, the, dead, tissue, from,
