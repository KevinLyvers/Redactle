dahlia, uk, d, e, l, i, day, lee, us, d, l, j, d, l, j, d, e, l, j, da, h, l, y, dayl, y, is, a, genus, of, bushy, tuberous, herbaceous, perennial, plants, native, to, mexico, and, central, america, as, a, member, of, the, asteraceae, synonym, name, compositae, family, of, dicotyledonous, plants, its, relatives, include, the, sunflower, daisy, chrysanthemum, and, zinnia, there, are, 49, species, of, dahlia, with, flowers, in, almost, every, hue, except, blue, with, hybrids, commonly, grown, as, garden, plants, dahlias, were, known, only, to, the, aztecs, and, other, southern, north, american, peoples, until, the, spanish, conquest, after, which, the, plants, were, brought, to, europe, the, high, in, sugar, tubers, of, some, varieties, are, of, value, to, humans, there, is, also, a, special, polysaccharide, of, fructan, obtained, known, as, inulin, dahlias, are, perennial, plants, with, tuberous, roots, though, they, are, grown, as, annuals, in, some, regions, with, cold, winters, while, some, have, herbaceous, stems, others, have, stems, which, lignify, in, the, absence, of, secondary, tissue, and, resprout, following, winter, dormancy, allowing, further, seasons, of, growth, as, a, member, of, the, asteraceae, the, dahlia, has, a, flower, head, that, is, actually, a, composite, hence, the, older, name, compositae, with, both, central, disc, florets, and, surrounding, ray, florets, each, floret, is, a, flower, in, its, own, right, but, is, often, incorrectly, described, as, a, petal, the, modern, name, asteraceae, refers, to, the, appearance, of, a, star, with, surrounding, rays, the, stems, are, leafy, ranging, in, height, from, as, low, as, 30, centimetres, 12, inches, to, more, than, 1, 8, 2, 4, metres, 6, 8, feet, flower, forms, are, variable, with, one, head, per, stem, these, can, be, as, small, as, 5, cm, 2, in, in, diameter, or, up, to, 30, cm, 1, ft, dinner, plate, the, majority, of, species, do, not, produce, scented, flowers, like, most, plants, that, do, not, attract, pollinating, insects, through, scent, they, are, brightly, colored, displaying, most, hues, with, the, exception, of, blue, the, great, variety, in, species, results, from, garden, dahlias, being, octoploids, having, eight, sets, of, homologous, chromosomes, in, addition, dahlias, also, contain, many, transposons, genetic, pieces, that, move, from, place, to, place, upon, an, allele, which, contributes, to, their, manifesting, such, great, diversity, spaniards, reported, finding, the, plants, growing, in, mexico, in, 1525, but, the, earliest, known, description, is, by, francisco, hern, ndez, physician, to, philip, ii, who, was, ordered, to, visit, mexico, in, 1570, to, study, the, natural, products, of, that, country, they, were, used, as, a, source, of, food, by, the, indigenous, peoples, who, both, gathered, wild, specimens, and, cultivated, crops, the, indigenous, peoples, variously, identified, the, plants, as, chichipatl, toltecs, and, acocotle, or, cocoxochitl, aztecs, from, hernandez, s, perception, of, nahuatl, to, spanish, through, various, other, translations, the, word, is, water, cane, water, pipe, water, pipe, flower, hollow, stem, flower, or, cane, flower, all, referring, to, the, hollow, plant, stems, hernandez, described, two, varieties, of, dahlias, the, pinwheel, like, dahlia, pinnata, and, the, huge, dahlia, imperialis, as, well, as, other, medicinal, plants, of, new, spain, francisco, dominguez, an, hidalgo, gentleman, who, accompanied, hernandez, on, part, of, his, seven, year, study, made, a, series, of, drawings, to, supplement, the, four, volume, report, three, of, his, drawings, showed, plants, with, flowers, two, resembled, the, modern, bedding, dahlia, and, one, resembled, the, species, dahlia, merckii, all, displayed, a, high, degree, of, doubleness, in, 1578, a, manuscript, titled, nova, plantarum, animalium, et, mineralium, mexicanorum, historia, was, sent, back, to, the, escorial, in, madrid, it, was, translated, into, latin, by, francisco, ximenes, in, 1615, in, 1640, francisco, cesi, president, of, the, academia, dei, lincei, of, rome, bought, the, ximenes, translation, and, after, annotating, it, published, it, in, 1649, 1651, as, two, volumes, rerum, medicarum, novae, hispaniae, thesaurus, seu, nova, plantarium, animalium, et, mineralium, mexicanorum, historia, the, original, manuscripts, were, destroyed, in, a, fire, in, the, mid, 1600s, in, 1787, the, french, botanist, nicolas, joseph, thi, ry, de, menonville, sent, to, mexico, to, steal, the, cochineal, insect, valued, for, its, scarlet, dye, reported, the, strangely, beautiful, flowers, he, had, seen, growing, in, a, garden, in, oaxaca, in, 1789, vicente, cervantes, director, of, the, botanical, garden, at, mexico, city, sent, plant, parts, to, abbe, antonio, jos, cavanilles, director, of, the, royal, gardens, of, madrid, cavanilles, flowered, one, plant, that, same, year, then, the, second, one, a, year, later, in, 1791, he, called, the, new, growths, dahlia, for, anders, dahl, the, first, plant, was, called, dahlia, pinnata, after, its, pinnate, foliage, the, second, dahlia, rosea, for, its, rose, purple, color, in, 1796, from, the, parts, sent, by, cervantes, cavanilles, flowered, a, third, plant, which, he, named, dahlia, coccinea, for, its, scarlet, color, in, 1798, cavanilles, sent, d, pinnata, seeds, to, parma, italy, that, year, the, marchioness, of, bute, wife, of, the, earl, of, bute, the, english, ambassador, to, spain, obtained, a, few, seeds, from, cavanilles, and, sent, them, to, kew, gardens, where, they, flowered, but, were, lost, after, two, to, three, years, in, the, following, years, madrid, sent, seeds, to, berlin, and, dresden, in, germany, and, to, turin, and, thiene, in, italy, in, 1802, cavanilles, sent, tubers, of, these, three, d, pinnata, d, rosea, d, coccinea, to, swiss, botanist, augustin, pyramus, de, candolle, at, university, of, montpelier, in, france, andre, thouin, at, the, jardin, des, plantes, in, paris, and, scottish, botanist, william, aiton, at, kew, gardens, that, same, year, john, fraser, english, nurseryman, and, later, botanical, collector, to, the, czar, of, russia, brought, d, coccinea, seeds, from, paris, to, the, apothecaries, gardens, in, england, where, they, flowered, in, his, greenhouse, a, year, later, providing, botanical, magazine, with, an, illustration, in, 1804, a, new, species, dahlia, sambucifolia, was, successfully, grown, at, holland, house, kensington, whilst, in, madrid, in, 1804, lady, holland, was, given, either, dahlia, seeds, or, tubers, by, cavanilles, she, sent, them, back, to, england, to, lord, holland, s, librarian, at, holland, house, who, successfully, raised, the, plants, and, produced, two, double, flowers, a, year, later, the, plants, raised, in, 1804, did, not, survive, new, stock, was, brought, from, france, in, 1815, in, 1824, lord, holland, sent, his, wife, a, note, containing, the, following, verse, the, dahlia, you, brought, to, our, isle, your, praises, for, ever, shall, speak, mid, gardens, as, sweet, as, your, smile, and, in, colour, as, bright, as, your, cheek, in, 1805, german, naturalist, alexander, von, humboldt, sent, more, seeds, from, mexico, to, aiton, in, england, thouin, in, paris, and, christoph, friedrich, otto, director, of, the, berlin, botanical, garden, more, significantly, he, sent, seeds, to, botanist, carl, ludwig, willdenow, in, germany, willdenow, now, reclassified, the, rapidly, growing, number, of, species, changing, the, genus, from, dahlia, to, georgina, after, naturalist, johann, gottlieb, georgi, he, combined, the, cavanilles, species, d, pinnata, and, d, rosea, under, the, name, of, georgina, variabilis, d, coccinea, was, still, held, to, be, a, separate, species, which, he, renamed, georgina, coccinea, since, 1789, when, cavanilles, first, flowered, the, dahlia, in, europe, there, has, been, an, ongoing, effort, by, many, growers, botanists, and, taxonomists, to, determine, the, development, of, the, dahlia, to, modern, times, at, least, 85, species, have, been, reported, approximately, 25, of, these, were, first, reported, from, the, wild, the, remainder, appeared, in, gardens, in, europe, they, were, considered, hybrids, the, results, of, crossing, between, previously, reported, species, or, developed, from, the, seeds, sent, by, humboldt, from, mexico, in, 1805, or, perhaps, from, some, other, undocumented, seeds, that, had, found, their, way, to, europe, several, of, these, were, soon, discovered, to, be, identical, with, earlier, reported, species, but, the, greatest, number, are, new, varieties, morphological, variation, is, highly, pronounced, in, the, dahlia, william, john, cooper, lawrence, who, hybridized, hundreds, of, families, of, dahlias, in, the, 1920s, stated, i, have, not, yet, seen, any, two, plants, in, the, families, i, have, raised, which, were, not, to, be, distinguished, one, from, the, other, constant, reclassification, of, the, 85, reported, species, has, resulted, in, a, considerably, smaller, number, of, distinct, species, as, there, is, a, great, deal, of, disagreement, today, between, systematists, over, classification, in, 1829, all, species, growing, in, europe, were, reclassified, under, an, all, encompassing, name, of, d, variabilis, desf, though, this, is, not, an, accepted, name, through, the, interspecies, cross, of, the, humboldt, seeds, and, the, cavanilles, species, 22, new, species, were, reported, by, that, year, all, of, which, had, been, classified, in, different, ways, by, several, different, taxonomists, creating, considerable, confusion, as, to, which, species, was, which, as, of, now, dahlias, are, classified, into, 15, different, species, by, botanist, liberty, hyde, bailey, in, 1830, william, smith, suggested, that, all, dahlia, species, could, be, divided, into, two, groups, for, color, red, tinged, and, purple, tinged, in, investigating, this, idea, lawrence, determined, that, with, the, exception, of, d, variabilis, all, dahlia, species, may, be, assigned, to, one, of, two, groups, for, flower, colour, group, i, ivory, magenta, or, group, ii, yellow, orange, scarlet, the, genus, dahlia, is, situated, in, the, asteroideae, subfamily, of, the, asteraceae, in, the, coreopsideae, tribe, within, that, tribe, it, is, the, second, largest, genus, after, coreopsis, and, appears, as, a, well, defined, clade, within, the, coreopsideae, sherff, 1955, in, the, first, modern, taxonomy, described, three, sections, for, the, 18, species, he, recognised, pseudodendron, epiphytum, and, dahlia, by, 1969, s, rensen, recognised, 29, species, and, four, sections, by, splitting, off, entemophyllon, from, section, dahlia, by, contrast, giannasi, 1975, using, a, phytochemical, analysis, based, on, flavonoids, reduced, the, genus, to, just, two, sections, entemophyllon, and, dahlia, the, latter, having, three, subsections, pseudodendron, dahlia, and, merckii, s, rensen, then, issued, a, further, revision, in, 1980, incorporating, subsection, merckii, in, his, original, section, dahlia, when, he, described, two, new, species, in, the, 1980s, dahlia, tubulata, and, d, congestifolia, he, placed, them, within, his, existing, sections, a, further, species, dahlia, sorensenii, was, added, by, hansen, and, hjerting, in, 1996, at, the, same, time, they, demonstrated, that, dahlia, pinnata, should, more, properly, be, designated, d, x, pinnata, d, x, pinnata, was, shown, to, actually, be, a, variant, of, d, sorensenii, that, had, acquired, hybrid, qualities, before, it, was, introduced, to, europe, in, the, sixteenth, century, and, formally, named, by, cavanilles, the, original, wild, d, pinnata, is, presumed, extinct, further, species, continue, to, be, described, saar, 2003, describing, 35, species, however, separation, of, the, sections, on, morphological, cytologal, and, biocemical, criteria, has, not, been, entirely, satisfactory, to, date, these, sectional, divisions, have, not, been, fully, supported, phylogenetically, which, demonstrate, only, section, entemophyllon, as, a, distinct, sectional, clade, the, other, major, grouping, is, the, core, dahlia, clade, cdc, which, includes, most, of, the, section, dahlia, the, remainder, of, the, species, occupy, what, has, been, described, as, the, variable, root, clade, vrc, which, includes, the, small, section, pseudodendron, but, also, the, monotypic, section, epiphytum, and, a, number, of, species, from, within, section, dahlia, outside, of, these, three, clades, lie, d, tubulata, and, d, merckii, as, a, polytomy, horticulturally, the, sections, retain, some, usage, section, pseudodendron, being, referred, to, as, tree, dahlias, epiphytum, as, the, vine, dahlia, the, remaining, two, herbaceous, sections, being, distinguished, by, their, pinnules, opposing, dahlia, or, alternating, entemophyllon, sections, including, chromosome, numbers, with, geographical, distribution, only, pseudodendron, d, imperialis, and, dahlia, d, australis, d, coccinea, occur, outside, mexico, there, are, currently, 42, accepted, species, in, the, genus, dahlia, but, new, species, continue, to, be, described, the, naming, of, the, plant, itself, has, long, been, a, subject, of, some, confusion, many, sources, state, that, the, name, dahlia, was, bestowed, by, the, pioneering, swedish, botanist, and, taxonomist, carl, linnaeus, to, honor, his, late, student, anders, dahl, author, of, observationes, botanicae, however, linnaeus, died, in, 1778, more, than, eleven, years, before, the, plant, was, introduced, into, europe, in, 1789, so, while, it, is, generally, agreed, that, the, plant, was, named, in, 1791, in, honor, of, dahl, who, had, died, two, years, before, linnaeus, could, not, have, been, the, one, who, did, so, it, was, probably, abbe, antonio, jose, cavanilles, director, of, the, royal, gardens, of, madrid, who, should, be, credited, with, the, attempt, to, scientifically, define, the, genus, since, he, not, only, received, the, first, specimens, from, mexico, in, 1789, but, named, the, first, three, species, that, flowered, from, the, cuttings, regardless, of, who, bestowed, it, the, name, was, not, so, easily, established, in, 1805, german, botanist, carl, ludwig, willdenow, asserting, that, the, genus, dahlia, thunb, published, a, year, after, cavanilles, s, genus, and, now, considered, a, synonym, of, trichocladus, was, more, widely, accepted, changed, the, plants, genus, from, dahlia, to, georgina, after, the, german, born, naturalist, johann, gottlieb, georgi, a, professor, at, the, imperial, academy, of, sciences, of, st, petersburg, russia, he, also, reclassified, and, renamed, the, first, three, species, grown, and, identified, by, cavanilles, it, was, not, until, 1810, in, a, published, article, that, he, officially, adopted, the, cavanilles, s, original, designation, of, dahlia, however, the, name, georgina, still, persisted, in, germany, for, the, next, few, decades, in, russian, it, is, still, named, georgina, russian, a, dahlia, is, found, predominantly, in, mexico, but, some, species, are, found, ranging, as, far, south, as, northern, south, america, d, australis, occurs, at, least, as, far, south, as, southwestern, guatemala, while, d, coccinea, and, d, imperialis, also, occur, in, parts, of, central, america, and, northern, south, america, dahlia, is, a, genus, of, the, uplands, and, mountains, being, found, at, elevations, between, 1, 500, and, 3, 700, m, 4, 900, and, 12, 100, ft, in, what, has, been, described, as, a, pine, oak, woodland, vegetative, zone, most, species, have, limited, ranges, scattered, throughout, many, mountain, ranges, in, mexico, the, most, common, pollinators, are, bees, and, small, beetles, slugs, and, snails, are, serious, pests, in, some, parts, of, the, world, particularly, in, spring, when, new, growth, is, emerging, through, the, soil, earwigs, can, also, disfigure, the, blooms, and, foliage, the, other, main, pests, likely, to, be, encountered, are, aphids, usually, on, young, stems, and, immature, flower, buds, red, spider, mite, causing, foliage, mottling, and, discolouration, worse, in, hot, and, dry, conditions, and, capsid, bugs, resulting, in, contortion, and, holes, at, growing, tips, diseases, affecting, dahlias, include, powdery, mildew, grey, mould, botrytis, cinerea, verticillium, wilt, dahlia, smut, entyloma, calendulae, f, dahliae, phytophthora, and, some, plant, viruses, dahlias, are, a, source, of, food, for, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, species, including, angle, shades, common, swift, ghost, moth, and, large, yellow, underwing, dahlias, grow, naturally, in, climates, that, do, not, experience, frost, the, tubers, are, hardy, to, usda, zone, 8, consequently, they, are, not, adapted, to, withstand, sub, zero, temperatures, however, their, tuberous, nature, enables, them, to, survive, periods, of, dormancy, and, this, characteristic, means, that, gardeners, in, temperate, climates, with, frosts, can, grow, dahlias, successfully, provided, the, tubers, are, lifted, from, the, ground, and, stored, in, cool, yet, frost, free, conditions, during, the, winter, planting, the, tubers, quite, deep, 10, 15, cm, or, 4, 6, in, also, provides, some, protection, when, in, active, growth, modern, dahlia, hybrids, perform, most, successfully, in, well, watered, yet, free, draining, soils, in, situations, receiving, plenty, of, sunlight, taller, cultivars, usually, require, some, form, of, staking, as, they, grow, and, all, garden, dahlias, need, deadheading, regularly, once, flowering, commences, horticulturally, the, garden, dahlia, is, usually, treated, as, the, cultigen, d, variabilis, hort, which, while, being, responsible, for, thousands, of, cultivars, has, an, obscure, taxonomic, status, 41, 42, the, inappropriate, term, d, variabilis, is, often, used, to, describe, the, cultivars, of, dahlia, since, the, correct, parentage, remains, obscure, but, probably, involves, dahlia, coccinea, in, 1846, the, caledonia, horticultural, society, of, edinburgh, offered, a, prize, of, 2, 000, pounds, to, the, first, person, succeeding, in, producing, a, blue, dahlia, this, has, to, date, not, been, accomplished, while, dahlias, produce, anthocyanin, an, element, necessary, for, the, production, of, the, blue, to, achieve, a, true, blue, color, in, a, plant, the, anthocyanin, delphinidin, needs, six, hydroxyl, groups, to, date, dahlias, have, only, developed, five, so, the, closest, that, breeders, have, come, to, achieving, a, blue, specimen, are, variations, of, mauve, purples, and, lilac, hues, by, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, a, number, of, different, types, were, recognised, these, terms, were, based, on, shape, or, colour, and, the, national, dahlia, society, included, cactus, pompon, single, show, and, fancy, in, its, 1904, guide, many, national, societies, developed, their, own, classification, systems, until, 1962, when, the, international, horticultural, congress, agreed, to, develop, an, internationally, recognised, system, at, its, brussels, meeting, that, year, and, subsequently, in, maryland, in, 1966, this, culminated, in, the, 1969, publication, of, the, international, register, of, dahlia, names, by, the, royal, horticultural, society, which, became, the, central, registering, authority, this, system, depended, primarily, on, the, visibility, of, the, central, disc, whether, it, was, open, centred, or, whether, only, ray, florets, were, apparent, centrally, double, bloom, the, double, bloom, cultivars, were, then, subdivided, according, to, the, way, in, which, they, were, folded, along, their, longitudinal, axis, flat, involute, curled, inwards, or, revolute, curling, backwards, if, the, end, of, the, ray, floret, was, split, they, were, considered, fimbriated, based, on, these, characteristics, nine, groups, were, defined, plus, a, tenth, miscellaneous, group, for, any, cultivars, not, fitting, the, above, characteristics, fimbriated, dahlias, were, added, in, 2004, and, two, further, groups, single, and, double, orchid, in, 2007, the, last, group, to, be, added, peony, first, appeared, in, 2012, in, many, cases, the, bloom, diameter, was, then, used, to, further, label, certain, groups, from, miniature, to, giant, this, practice, was, abandoned, in, 2012, there, are, now, more, than, 57, 000, registered, cultivars, which, are, officially, registered, through, the, royal, horticultural, society, rhs, the, official, register, is, the, international, register, of, dahlia, names, 1969, 1995, reprint, which, is, updated, by, annual, supplements, the, original, 1969, registry, published, about, 14, 000, cultivars, adding, a, further, 1700, by, 1986, and, in, 2003, there, were, 18, 000, since, then, about, a, hundred, new, cultivars, are, added, annually, the, official, rhs, classification, lists, fourteen, groups, grouped, by, flower, type, together, with, the, abbreviations, used, by, the, rhs, earlier, versions, of, the, registry, subdivided, some, groups, by, flower, size, groups, 4, 5, 8, and, 9, were, divided, into, five, subgroups, a, to, e, from, giant, to, miniature, and, group, 6, into, two, subgroups, small, and, miniature, dahlias, were, then, described, by, group, and, subgroup, e, g, 5, d, ace, summer, sunset, some, dahlia, societies, have, continued, this, practice, but, this, is, neither, official, nor, standardised, as, of, 2013, the, rhs, uses, two, size, descriptors, sizes, can, range, from, tiny, micro, dahlias, with, flowers, less, than, 50mm, to, giants, that, are, over, 250mm, in, diameter, the, groupings, listed, here, are, from, the, new, zealand, society, in, addition, to, the, official, classification, and, the, terminology, used, by, various, dahlia, societies, individual, horticulturalists, use, a, wide, range, of, other, descriptions, such, as, incurved, and, abbreviations, in, their, catalogues, such, as, co, for, collarette, some, plant, growers, include, their, brand, name, in, the, cultivar, name, thus, fides, part, of, the, d, mmen, orange, group, in, the, netherlands, developed, a, series, of, cultivars, which, they, named, the, dahlinova, series, for, example, dahlinova, carolina, burgundy, these, are, group, 10, miscellaneous, in, the, rhs, classification, scheme, in, 1805, several, new, species, were, reported, with, red, purple, lilac, and, pale, yellow, coloring, and, the, first, true, double, flower, was, produced, in, belgium, one, of, the, more, popular, concepts, of, dahlia, history, and, the, basis, for, many, different, interpretations, and, confusion, is, that, all, the, original, discoveries, were, single, flowered, types, which, through, hybridization, and, selective, breeding, produced, double, forms, many, of, the, species, of, dahlias, then, and, now, have, single, flowered, blooms, d, coccinea, the, third, dahlia, to, bloom, in, europe, was, a, single, but, two, of, the, three, drawings, of, dahlias, by, dominguez, made, in, mexico, between, 1570, and, 1577, showed, definite, characteristics, of, doubling, in, the, early, days, of, the, dahlia, in, europe, the, word, double, simply, designated, flowers, with, more, than, one, row, of, petals, the, greatest, effort, was, now, directed, to, developing, improved, types, of, double, dahlias, during, the, years, 1805, to, 1810, several, people, claimed, to, have, produced, a, double, dahlia, in, 1805, henry, c, andrews, made, a, drawing, of, such, a, plant, in, the, collection, of, lady, holland, grown, from, seedlings, sent, that, year, from, madrid, like, other, doubles, of, the, time, it, did, not, resemble, the, doubles, of, today, the, first, modern, double, or, full, double, appeared, in, belgium, m, donckelaar, director, of, the, botanic, garden, at, louvain, selected, plants, for, that, characteristic, and, within, a, few, years, secured, three, fully, double, forms, by, 1826, double, varieties, were, being, grown, almost, exclusively, and, there, was, very, little, interest, in, the, single, forms, up, to, this, time, all, the, so, called, double, dahlias, had, been, purple, or, tinged, with, purple, and, it, was, doubted, if, a, variety, untinged, with, that, color, was, obtainable, in, 1843, scented, single, forms, of, dahlias, were, first, reported, in, neu, verbass, austria, d, crocea, a, fragrant, variety, grown, from, one, of, the, humboldt, seeds, was, probably, interbred, with, the, single, d, coccinea, a, new, scented, species, would, not, be, introduced, until, the, next, century, when, the, d, coronata, was, brought, from, mexico, to, germany, in, 1907, the, exact, date, the, dahlia, was, introduced, in, the, united, states, is, uncertain, one, of, the, first, dahlias, in, the, usa, may, have, been, the, d, coccinea, speciosissima, grown, by, william, leathe, of, cambridgeport, near, boston, around, 1929, according, to, edward, sayers, it, attracted, much, admiration, and, at, that, time, was, considered, a, very, elegant, flower, it, was, however, soon, eclipsed, by, that, splendid, scarlet, the, countess, of, liverpool, however, 9, cultivars, were, already, listed, in, the, catalog, from, thornburn, 1825, and, even, earlier, reference, can, be, found, in, a, catalogue, from, the, linnaean, botanical, garden, new, york, 1820, that, includes, one, scarlet, one, purple, and, two, double, orange, dahlias, for, sale, sayers, stated, that, no, person, has, done, more, for, the, introduction, and, advancement, of, the, culture, of, the, dahlia, than, george, c, thorburn, of, new, york, who, yearly, flowers, many, thousand, plants, at, his, place, at, hallet, s, cove, near, harlaem, the, show, there, in, the, flowering, season, is, a, rich, treat, for, the, lovers, of, floriculture, for, almost, every, variety, can, be, seen, growing, in, two, large, blocks, or, masses, which, lead, from, the, road, to, the, dwelling, house, and, form, a, complete, field, of, the, dahlia, as, a, foreground, to, the, house, mr, t, hogg, william, read, and, many, other, well, known, florists, have, also, contributed, much, in, the, vicinity, of, new, york, to, the, introduction, of, the, dahlia, indeed, so, general, has, become, the, taste, that, almost, every, garden, has, its, show, of, the, dahlia, in, the, season, in, boston, too, there, were, many, collections, a, collection, from, the, messrs, hovey, of, cambridgeport, was, also, mentioned, in, 1835, thomas, bridgeman, published, a, list, of, 160, double, dahlias, in, his, florist, s, guide, 60, of, the, choicest, were, supplied, by, mr, g, c, thornburn, of, astoria, new,

the, netherlands, received, a, shipment, of, seeds, and, plants, from, a, friend, in, mexico, the, entire, shipment, was, badly, rotted, and, appeared, to, be, ruined, but, van, der, berg, examined, it, carefully, and, found, a, small, piece, of, root, that, seemed, alive, he, planted, and, carefully, tended, it, it, grew, into, a, plant, that, he, identified, as, a, dahlia, he, made, cuttings, from, the, plant, during, the, winter, of, 1872, 1873, this, was, an, entirely, different, type, of, flower, with, rich, red, color, and, a, high, degree, of, doubling, in, 1874, van, der, berg, catalogued, it, for, sale, calling, it, dahlia, juarezii, to, honor, mexican, president, benito, pablo, juarez, who, had, died, the, year, before, and, described, it, as, equal, to, the, beautiful, color, of, the, red, poppy, its, form, is, very, outstanding, and, different, in, every, respect, of, all, known, dahlia, flowers, this, plant, has, perhaps, had, a, greater, influence, on, the, popularity, of, the, modern, dahlia, than, any, other, called, les, etoiles, du, diable, stars, of, the, devil, in, france, and, cactus, dahlia, elsewhere, the, edges, of, its, petals, rolled, backwards, rather, than, forward, and, this, new, form, revolutionized, the, dahlia, world, it, was, thought, to, be, a, distinct, mutation, since, no, other, plant, that, resembled, it, could, be, found, in, the, wild, today, it, is, assumed, that, d, juarezii, had, at, one, time, existed, in, mexico, and, subsequently, disappeared, nurserymen, in, europe, crossbred, this, plant, with, dahlias, discovered, earlier, the, results, became, the, progenitors, of, all, modern, dahlia, hybrids, today, as, of, 2015, 124, dahlia, cultivars, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award,
