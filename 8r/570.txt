coral, snakes, are, a, large, group, of, elapid, snakes, that, can, be, divided, into, two, distinct, groups, the, old, world, coral, snakes, and, new, world, coral, snakes, there, are, 27, species, of, old, world, coral, snakes, in, three, genera, calliophis, hemibungarus, and, sinomicrurus, and, 83, recognized, species, of, new, world, coral, snakes, in, two, genera, micruroides, and, micrurus, genetic, studies, have, found, that, the, most, basal, lineages, have, origins, in, asia, suggesting, that, the, group, originated, in, the, old, world, while, new, world, species, of, both, genera, are, venomous, their, bites, are, seldom, lethal, only, two, confirmed, fatalities, have, been, documented, in, the, past, 100, years, from, the, genus, micrurus, meanwhile, snakes, of, the, genus, micruroides, have, never, caused, a, medically, significant, bite, experts, now, recognize, that, certain, coloration, patterns, and, common, mnemonics, such, as, the, phrase, red, against, yellow, deadly, fellow, red, against, black, friendly, jack, which, people, sometimes, use, to, distinguish, between, the, venomous, coral, snake, and, the, non, venomous, milksnake, are, not, consistent, enough, to, be, trustworthy, while, any, snake, exhibiting, the, coral, snake, s, color, and, or, banding, pattern, in, the, southeastern, united, states, will, almost, certainly, in, fact, be, a, coral, snake, there, are, coral, snakes, in, other, parts, of, the, world, which, are, colored, differently, coral, snakes, in, the, united, states, are, most, notable, for, their, red, yellow, white, and, black, colored, banding, however, several, nonvenomous, species, in, the, u, s, have, similar, though, not, identical, bandings, including, the, two, scarlet, snake, species, in, the, genus, cemophora, and, some, of, the, kingsnakes, including, the, aforementioned, milksnakes, in, the, genus, lampropeltis, however, in, reference, to, the, mnemonic, phrase, red, touching, yellow, a, deadly, fellow, some, of, these, kingsnakes, do, not, naturally, display, any, red, touching, yellow, to, begin, with, additionally, some, ground, snakes, in, the, genus, sonora, of, the, southwestern, u, s, can, have, a, color, pattern, that, matches, that, of, the, sympatric, sonoran, coral, snake, micruroides, euryxanthus, no, genuine, coral, snake, in, the, u, s, exhibits, red, bands, of, color, in, contact, with, bands, of, black, except, in, rare, cases, of, an, aberrant, pattern, thus, while, on, extremely, rare, occasions, when, a, certain, non, venomous, snake, might, be, mistaken, for, a, coral, snake, the, mnemonic, holds, true, however, a, red, yellow, black, banded, snake, in, the, u, s, whose, red, and, black, banding, actually, touch, is, rarely, a, venomous, coral, snake, furthermore, the, mnemonic, is, not, consistently, accurate, for, north, american, coral, snake, species, found, south, of, the, u, s, either, some, species, like, mexico, s, oaxacan, coral, snake, micrurus, ephippifer, or, clark, s, coral, snake, micrurus, clarki, of, costa, rica, panama, do, actually, fit, the, mnemonic, others, like, the, honduran, roatan, coral, snake, micrurus, ruatanus, or, the, redtail, coral, snake, micrurus, mipartitus, of, panama, do, not, further, still, some, south, american, coral, snakes, will, fit, the, mnemonic, while, others, do, not, to, complicate, the, issue, more, the, south, american, tricolored, hognose, snake, xenodon, pulcher, has, repeated, bands, of, red, black, white, black, imitating, the, coral, snake, as, a, defense, mechanism, with, the, key, visual, difference, being, their, upturned, snout, used, for, burrowing, the, hognoses, are, actually, mildly, rear, fanged, venomous, although, generally, not, considered, serious, to, humans, anecdotal, research, has, suggested, the, south, american, hognoses, to, possess, slightly, more, potent, venom, than, the, north, american, hognoses, in, the, old, world, none, of, the, coral, snake, species, usually, fit, the, mnemonic, most, species, of, coral, snake, are, small, in, size, north, american, species, average, around, 90, cm, 3, ft, in, length, but, specimens, of, up, to, 150, cm, 5, ft, or, slightly, larger, have, been, reported, some, coral, snakes, even, live, in, the, water, but, most, of, them, do, not, aquatic, species, have, flattened, tails, that, act, as, fins, aiding, in, swimming, coral, snakes, vary, widely, in, their, behavior, but, most, are, very, elusive, fossorial, burrowing, snakes, which, spend, most, of, their, time, buried, beneath, the, ground, or, in, the, leaf, litter, of, a, rainforest, floor, coming, to, the, surface, only, when, it, rains, or, during, breeding, season, some, species, like, micrurus, surinamensis, are, almost, entirely, aquatic, and, spend, most, of, their, lives, in, slow, moving, bodies, of, water, that, have, dense, vegetation, coral, snakes, feed, mostly, on, smaller, snakes, lizards, frogs, nestling, birds, small, rodents, etc, like, all, elapid, snakes, coral, snakes, possess, a, pair, of, small, hollow, fangs, to, deliver, their, venom, the, fangs, are, positioned, at, the, front, of, the, mouth, the, fangs, are, fixed, in, position, rather, than, retractable, and, rather, than, being, directly, connected, to, the, venom, duct, they, have, a, small, groove, through, which, the, venom, enters, the, base, of, the, fangs, because, the, fangs, are, relatively, small, and, inefficient, for, venom, delivery, rather, than, biting, quickly, and, letting, go, like, vipers, coral, snakes, tend, to, hold, onto, their, prey, and, make, chewing, motions, when, biting, the, venom, takes, time, to, reach, full, effect, coral, snakes, are, not, aggressive, or, prone, to, biting, and, account, for, less, than, one, percent, of, the, total, number, of, snake, bites, each, year, in, the, united, states, the, life, span, of, coral, snakes, in, captivity, is, about, seven, years, m, fulvius, reproduction, is, internal, fertilization, through, the, use, of, hemipenes, the, breeding, season, occurs, from, spring, to, early, summer, and, late, summer, to, early, fall, male, combat, is, not, typical, in, m, fulvius, as, males, are, smaller, than, females, micrurus, fulvius, are, oviparous, and, typically, lay, eggs, from, may, to, july, during, early, spring, females, will, undergo, sudden, vitellogenesis, oocyte, and, yolk, formation, in, preparation, for, breeding, approximately, 37, days, post, fertilization, oviposition, occurs, and, the, average, clutch, size, ranges, from, five, to, seven, eggs, however, some, in, captivity, have, laid, as, many, as, thirteen, eggs, the, incubation, period, of, the, m, fulvius, eggs, normally, reaches, 60, days, males, also, undergo, sexual, changes, throughout, the, year, testicular, recrudescence, start, in, the, fall, and, testicular, regression, occurs, come, spring, however, males, typically, have, mature, sperm, residing, in, the, epididymis, year, round, and, are, capable, of, storing, sperm, in, the, deferent, duct, over, the, winter, till, the, females, are, receptive, a, study, investigating, how, climate, influences, the, reproductive, cycle, discovered, species, found, closer, to, the, equator, displayed, more, continuous, cycles, while, those, in, colder, regions, had, more, seasonal, cycles, with, increasing, temperatures, as, a, result, of, climate, change, continuous, cycles, have, the, possibility, of, becoming, more, prevalent, offspring, reach, maturation, depending, on, sex, males, mature, at, roughly, 11, to, 16, months, while, females, reach, maturity, later, at, 26, months, new, world, coral, snakes, exist, in, the, southern, range, of, many, temperate, u, s, states, coral, snakes, are, found, in, scattered, localities, in, the, southern, coastal, plains, from, north, carolina, to, louisiana, including, all, of, florida, they, can, be, found, in, pine, and, scrub, oak, sandhill, habitats, in, parts, of, this, range, but, sometimes, inhabit, hardwood, areas, and, pine, flatwoods, that, undergo, seasonal, flooding, there, is, controversy, about, the, classification, of, the, very, similar, texas, coral, snake, as, a, separate, species, its, habitat, in, texas, louisiana, and, arkansas, is, separated, from, the, eastern, coral, snake, s, habitat, by, the, mississippi, river, the, coral, snake, population, is, most, dense, in, the, southeastern, united, states, the, arizona, coral, snake, is, classified, as, a, separate, species, and, genus, and, is, found, in, central, and, southern, arizona, extreme, southwestern, new, mexico, and, southward, to, sinaloa, in, western, mexico, it, occupies, arid, and, semiarid, regions, in, many, different, habitat, types, including, thornscrub, desert, scrub, woodland, grassland, and, farmland, it, is, found, in, the, plains, and, lower, mountain, slopes, at, elevations, ranging, from, sea, level, to, 1, 800, m, 5, 800, ft, often, found, in, rocky, areas, new, world, coral, snakes, possess, one, of, the, most, potent, venoms, of, any, north, american, snake, however, relatively, few, bites, are, recorded, due, to, their, reclusive, nature, and, the, fact, they, generally, inhabit, sparsely, populated, areas, even, in, areas, that, are, densely, populated, bites, are, rare, according, to, the, american, national, institutes, of, health, there, are, an, average, of, 15, 25, coral, snake, bites, in, the, united, states, each, year, when, confronted, by, humans, coral, snakes, will, almost, always, attempt, to, flee, and, bite, only, if, restrained, in, addition, coral, snakes, have, short, fangs, proteroglyph, dentition, that, cannot, penetrate, thick, clothing, although, bites, are, possible, through, normal, thin, clothing, any, skin, penetration, however, is, a, medical, emergency, that, requires, immediate, attention, historically, the, venom, of, the, north, american, micrurus, and, micruroides, species, was, believed, to, contain, powerful, neurotoxins, which, could, paralyze, the, breathing, muscles, requiring, mechanical, or, artificial, respiration, it, was, usually, reported, that, there, was, only, mild, pain, associated, with, a, bite, and, that, respiratory, failure, could, occur, and, onset, of, clinical, symptoms, may, be, delayed, for, as, much, as, 10, to, 18, hours, coral, snake, venom, contains, a, neurotoxic, component, and, symptoms, include, pain, from, the, bite, sialorrhea, paresthesia, ptosis, weakness, blurred, vision, paralysis, fasciculation, and, diplopia, however, recent, studies, on, the, bites, of, the, texas, coral, snake, micrurus, tener, have, shown, that, these, bites, rarely, require, antivenom, don, t, usually, show, any, systemic, respiratory, problems, and, can, be, intensely, painful, further, studies, are, necessary, to, see, if, these, clinical, features, are, true, of, all, micrurus, species, body, length, in, coral, snakes, appears, to, be, positively, associated, with, venom, yield, shortages, of, coral, snake, antivenom, were, previously, reported, but, one, source, states, that, production, has, resumed, and, as, of, july, 2021, pfizer, indicates, that, antivenom, is, available, species, in, this, genus, are, nota, bene, a, binomial, authority, in, parentheses, indicates, that, the, species, was, originally, described, in, a, genus, other, than, calliophis, species, in, this, genus, are, species, in, this, genus, are, nota, bene, in, the, following, list, a, binomial, authority, or, a, trinomial, authority, in, parentheses, indicates, that, the, species, or, subspecies, was, originally, described, in, a, genus, other, than, micrurus, new, world, coral, snakes, serve, as, models, for, their, batesian, mimics, false, coral, snakes, snake, species, whose, venom, is, less, toxic, as, well, as, for, many, nonvenomous, snake, species, that, bear, superficial, resemblances, to, them, the, role, of, coral, snakes, as, models, for, batesian, mimics, is, supported, by, research, showing, that, coral, snake, color, patterns, deter, predators, from, attacking, snake, shaped, prey, and, that, in, the, absence, of, coral, snakes, species, hypothesized, to, mimic, them, are, indeed, attacked, more, frequently, species, that, appear, similar, to, coral, snakes, include
