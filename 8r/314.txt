animal, colouration, is, the, general, appearance, of, an, animal, resulting, from, the, reflection, or, emission, of, light, from, its, surfaces, some, animals, are, brightly, coloured, while, others, are, hard, to, see, in, some, species, such, as, the, peafowl, the, male, has, strong, patterns, conspicuous, colours, and, is, iridescent, while, the, female, is, far, less, visible, there, are, several, separate, reasons, why, animals, have, evolved, colours, camouflage, enables, an, animal, to, remain, hidden, from, view, animals, use, colour, to, advertise, services, such, as, cleaning, to, animals, of, other, species, to, signal, their, sexual, status, to, other, members, of, the, same, species, and, in, mimicry, taking, advantage, of, the, warning, coloration, of, another, species, some, animals, use, flashes, of, colour, to, divert, attacks, by, startling, predators, zebras, may, possibly, use, motion, dazzle, confusing, a, predator, s, attack, by, moving, a, bold, pattern, rapidly, some, animals, are, coloured, for, physical, protection, with, pigments, in, the, skin, to, protect, against, sunburn, while, some, frogs, can, lighten, or, darken, their, skin, for, temperature, regulation, finally, animals, can, be, coloured, incidentally, for, example, blood, is, red, because, the, haem, pigment, needed, to, carry, oxygen, is, red, animals, coloured, in, these, ways, can, have, striking, natural, patterns, animals, produce, colour, in, both, direct, and, indirect, ways, direct, production, occurs, through, the, presence, of, visible, coloured, cells, known, as, pigment, which, are, particles, of, coloured, material, such, as, freckles, indirect, production, occurs, by, virtue, of, cells, known, as, chromatophores, which, are, pigment, containing, cells, such, as, hair, follicles, the, distribution, of, the, pigment, particles, in, the, chromatophores, can, change, under, hormonal, or, neuronal, control, for, fishes, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, chromatophores, may, respond, directly, to, environmental, stimuli, like, visible, light, uv, radiation, temperature, ph, chemicals, etc, colour, change, helps, individuals, in, becoming, more, or, less, visible, and, is, important, in, agonistic, displays, and, in, camouflage, some, animals, including, many, butterflies, and, birds, have, microscopic, structures, in, scales, bristles, or, feathers, which, give, them, brilliant, iridescent, colours, other, animals, including, squid, and, some, deep, sea, fish, can, produce, light, sometimes, of, different, colours, animals, often, use, two, or, more, of, these, mechanisms, together, to, produce, the, colours, and, effects, they, need, animal, coloration, has, been, a, topic, of, interest, and, research, in, biology, for, centuries, in, the, classical, era, aristotle, recorded, that, the, octopus, was, able, to, change, its, coloration, to, match, its, background, and, when, it, was, alarmed, in, his, 1665, book, micrographia, robert, hooke, describes, the, fantastical, structural, not, pigment, colours, of, the, peacock, s, feathers, the, parts, of, the, feathers, of, this, glorious, bird, appear, through, the, microscope, no, less, gaudy, then, do, the, whole, feathers, for, as, to, the, naked, eye, tis, evident, that, the, stem, or, quill, of, each, feather, in, the, tail, sends, out, multitudes, of, lateral, branches, so, each, of, those, threads, in, the, microscope, appears, a, large, long, body, consisting, of, a, multitude, of, bright, reflecting, parts, their, upper, sides, seem, to, me, to, consist, of, a, multitude, of, thin, plated, bodies, which, are, exceeding, thin, and, lie, very, close, together, and, thereby, like, mother, of, pearl, shells, do, not, onely, reflect, a, very, brisk, light, but, tinge, that, light, in, a, most, curious, manner, and, by, means, of, various, positions, in, respect, of, the, light, they, reflect, back, now, one, colour, and, then, another, and, those, most, vividly, now, that, these, colours, are, onely, fantastical, ones, that, is, such, as, arise, immediately, from, the, refractions, of, the, light, i, found, by, this, that, water, wetting, these, colour, d, parts, destroy, d, their, colours, which, seem, d, to, proceed, from, the, alteration, of, the, reflection, and, refraction, according, to, charles, darwin, s, 1859, theory, of, natural, selection, features, such, as, coloration, evolved, by, providing, individual, animals, with, a, reproductive, advantage, for, example, individuals, with, slightly, better, camouflage, than, others, of, the, same, species, would, on, average, leave, more, offspring, in, his, origin, of, species, darwin, wrote, when, we, see, leaf, eating, insects, green, and, bark, feeders, mottled, grey, the, alpine, ptarmigan, white, in, winter, the, red, grouse, the, colour, of, heather, and, the, black, grouse, that, of, peaty, earth, we, must, believe, that, these, tints, are, of, service, to, these, birds, and, insects, in, preserving, them, from, danger, grouse, if, not, destroyed, at, some, period, of, their, lives, would, increase, in, countless, numbers, they, are, known, to, suffer, largely, from, birds, of, prey, and, hawks, are, guided, by, eyesight, to, their, prey, so, much, so, that, on, parts, of, the, continent, persons, are, warned, not, to, keep, white, pigeons, as, being, the, most, liable, to, destruction, hence, i, can, see, no, reason, to, doubt, that, natural, selection, might, be, most, effective, in, giving, the, proper, colour, to, each, kind, of, grouse, and, in, keeping, that, colour, when, once, acquired, true, and, constant, henry, walter, bates, s, 1863, book, the, naturalist, on, the, river, amazons, describes, his, extensive, studies, of, the, insects, in, the, amazon, basin, and, especially, the, butterflies, he, discovered, that, apparently, similar, butterflies, often, belonged, to, different, families, with, a, harmless, species, mimicking, a, poisonous, or, bitter, tasting, species, to, reduce, its, chance, of, being, attacked, by, a, predator, in, the, process, now, called, after, him, batesian, mimicry, edward, bagnall, poulton, s, strongly, darwinian, 1890, book, the, colours, of, animals, their, meaning, and, use, especially, considered, in, the, case, of, insects, argued, the, case, for, three, aspects, of, animal, coloration, that, are, broadly, accepted, today, but, were, controversial, or, wholly, new, at, the, time, it, strongly, supported, darwin, s, theory, of, sexual, selection, arguing, that, the, obvious, differences, between, male, and, female, birds, such, as, the, argus, pheasant, were, selected, by, the, females, pointing, out, that, bright, male, plumage, was, found, only, in, species, which, court, by, day, the, book, introduced, the, concept, of, frequency, dependent, selection, as, when, edible, mimics, are, less, frequent, than, the, distasteful, models, whose, colours, and, patterns, they, copy, in, the, book, poulton, also, coined, the, term, aposematism, for, warning, coloration, which, he, identified, in, widely, differing, animal, groups, including, mammals, such, as, the, skunk, bees, and, wasps, beetles, and, butterflies, frank, evers, beddard, s, 1892, book, animal, coloration, acknowledged, that, natural, selection, existed, but, examined, its, application, to, camouflage, mimicry, and, sexual, selection, very, critically, the, book, was, in, turn, roundly, criticised, by, poulton, abbott, handerson, thayer, s, 1909, book, concealing, coloration, in, the, animal, kingdom, completed, by, his, son, gerald, h, thayer, argued, correctly, for, the, widespread, use, of, crypsis, among, animals, and, in, particular, described, and, explained, countershading, for, the, first, time, however, the, thayers, spoilt, their, case, by, arguing, that, camouflage, was, the, sole, purpose, of, animal, coloration, which, led, them, to, claim, that, even, the, brilliant, pink, plumage, of, the, flamingo, or, the, roseate, spoonbill, was, cryptic, against, the, momentarily, pink, sky, at, dawn, or, dusk, as, a, result, the, book, was, mocked, by, critics, including, theodore, roosevelt, as, having, pushed, to, such, a, fantastic, extreme, and, to, include, such, wild, absurdities, as, to, call, for, the, application, of, common, sense, thereto, hugh, bamford, cott, s, 500, page, book, adaptive, coloration, in, animals, published, in, wartime, 1940, systematically, described, the, principles, of, camouflage, and, mimicry, the, book, contains, hundreds, of, examples, over, a, hundred, photographs, and, cott, s, own, accurate, and, artistic, drawings, and, 27, pages, of, references, cott, focussed, especially, on, maximum, disruptive, contrast, the, kind, of, patterning, used, in, military, camouflage, such, as, disruptive, pattern, material, indeed, cott, describes, such, applications, the, effect, of, a, disruptive, pattern, is, to, break, up, what, is, really, a, continuous, surface, into, what, appears, to, be, a, number, of, discontinuous, surfaces, which, contradict, the, shape, of, the, body, on, which, they, are, superimposed, animal, coloration, provided, important, early, evidence, for, evolution, by, natural, selection, at, a, time, when, little, direct, evidence, was, available, one, of, the, pioneers, of, research, into, animal, coloration, edward, bagnall, poulton, classified, the, forms, of, protective, coloration, in, a, way, which, is, still, helpful, he, described, protective, resemblance, aggressive, resemblance, adventitious, protection, and, variable, protective, resemblance, these, are, covered, in, turn, below, protective, resemblance, is, used, by, prey, to, avoid, predation, it, includes, special, protective, resemblance, now, called, mimesis, where, the, whole, animal, looks, like, some, other, object, for, example, when, a, caterpillar, resembles, a, twig, or, a, bird, dropping, in, general, protective, resemblance, now, called, crypsis, the, animal, s, texture, blends, with, the, background, for, example, when, a, moth, s, colour, and, pattern, blend, in, with, tree, bark, aggressive, resemblance, is, used, by, predators, or, parasites, in, special, aggressive, resemblance, the, animal, looks, like, something, else, luring, the, prey, or, host, to, approach, for, example, when, a, flower, mantis, resembles, a, particular, kind, of, flower, such, as, an, orchid, in, general, aggressive, resemblance, the, predator, or, parasite, blends, in, with, the, background, for, example, when, a, leopard, is, hard, to, see, in, long, grass, for, adventitious, protection, an, animal, uses, materials, such, as, twigs, sand, or, pieces, of, shell, to, conceal, its, outline, for, example, when, a, caddis, fly, larva, builds, a, decorated, case, or, when, a, decorator, crab, decorates, its, back, with, seaweed, sponges, and, stones, in, variable, protective, resemblance, an, animal, such, as, a, chameleon, flatfish, squid, or, octopus, changes, its, skin, pattern, and, colour, using, special, chromatophore, cells, to, resemble, whatever, background, it, is, currently, resting, on, as, well, as, for, signalling, the, main, mechanisms, to, create, the, resemblances, described, by, poulton, whether, in, nature, or, in, military, applications, are, crypsis, blending, into, the, background, so, as, to, become, hard, to, see, this, covers, both, special, and, general, resemblance, disruptive, patterning, using, colour, and, pattern, to, break, up, the, animal, s, outline, which, relates, mainly, to, general, resemblance, mimesis, resembling, other, objects, of, no, special, interest, to, the, observer, which, relates, to, special, resemblance, countershading, using, graded, colour, to, create, the, illusion, of, flatness, which, relates, mainly, to, general, resemblance, and, counterillumination, producing, light, to, match, the, background, notably, in, some, species, of, squid, countershading, was, first, described, by, the, american, artist, abbott, handerson, thayer, a, pioneer, in, the, theory, of, animal, coloration, thayer, observed, that, whereas, a, painter, takes, a, flat, canvas, and, uses, coloured, paint, to, create, the, illusion, of, solidity, by, painting, in, shadows, animals, such, as, deer, are, often, darkest, on, their, backs, becoming, lighter, towards, the, belly, creating, as, zoologist, hugh, cott, observed, the, illusion, of, flatness, and, against, a, matching, background, of, invisibility, thayer, s, observation, animals, are, painted, by, nature, darkest, on, those, parts, which, tend, to, be, most, lighted, by, the, sky, s, light, and, vice, versa, is, called, thayer, s, law, colour, is, widely, used, for, signalling, in, animals, as, diverse, as, birds, and, shrimps, signalling, encompasses, at, least, three, purposes, advertising, coloration, can, signal, the, services, an, animal, offers, to, other, animals, these, may, be, of, the, same, species, as, in, sexual, selection, or, of, different, species, as, in, cleaning, symbiosis, signals, which, often, combine, colour, and, movement, may, be, understood, by, many, different, species, for, example, the, cleaning, stations, of, the, banded, coral, shrimp, stenopus, hispidus, are, visited, by, different, species, of, fish, and, even, by, reptiles, such, as, hawksbill, sea, turtles, darwin, observed, that, the, males, of, some, species, such, as, birds, of, paradise, were, very, different, from, the, females, darwin, explained, such, male, female, differences, in, his, theory, of, sexual, selection, in, his, book, the, descent, of, man, once, the, females, begin, to, select, males, according, to, any, particular, characteristic, such, as, a, long, tail, or, a, coloured, crest, that, characteristic, is, emphasized, more, and, more, in, the, males, eventually, all, the, males, will, have, the, characteristics, that, the, females, are, sexually, selecting, for, as, only, those, males, can, reproduce, this, mechanism, is, powerful, enough, to, create, features, that, are, strongly, disadvantageous, to, the, males, in, other, ways, for, example, some, male, birds, of, paradise, have, wing, or, tail, streamers, that, are, so, long, that, they, impede, flight, while, their, brilliant, colours, may, make, the, males, more, vulnerable, to, predators, in, the, extreme, sexual, selection, may, drive, species, to, extinction, as, has, been, argued, for, the, enormous, horns, of, the, male, irish, elk, which, may, have, made, it, difficult, for, mature, males, to, move, and, feed, different, forms, of, sexual, selection, are, possible, including, rivalry, among, males, and, selection, of, females, by, males, warning, coloration, aposematism, is, effectively, the, opposite, of, camouflage, and, a, special, case, of, advertising, its, function, is, to, make, the, animal, for, example, a, wasp, or, a, coral, snake, highly, conspicuous, to, potential, predators, so, that, it, is, noticed, remembered, and, then, avoided, as, peter, forbes, observes, human, warning, signs, employ, the, same, colours, red, yellow, black, and, white, that, nature, uses, to, advertise, dangerous, creatures, warning, colours, work, by, being, associated, by, potential, predators, with, something, that, makes, the, warning, coloured, animal, unpleasant, or, dangerous, this, can, be, achieved, in, several, ways, by, being, any, combination, of, warning, coloration, can, succeed, either, through, inborn, behaviour, instinct, on, the, part, of, potential, predators, or, through, a, learned, avoidance, either, can, lead, to, various, forms, of, mimicry, experiments, show, that, avoidance, is, learned, in, birds, mammals, lizards, and, amphibians, but, that, some, birds, such, as, great, tits, have, inborn, avoidance, of, certain, colours, and, patterns, such, as, black, and, yellow, stripes, mimicry, means, that, one, species, of, animal, resembles, another, species, closely, enough, to, deceive, predators, to, evolve, the, mimicked, species, must, have, warning, coloration, because, appearing, to, be, bitter, tasting, or, dangerous, gives, natural, selection, something, to, work, on, once, a, species, has, a, slight, chance, resemblance, to, a, warning, coloured, species, natural, selection, can, drive, its, colours, and, patterns, towards, more, perfect, mimicry, there, are, numerous, possible, mechanisms, of, which, the, best, known, are, batesian, mimicry, was, first, described, by, the, pioneering, naturalist, henry, w, bates, when, an, edible, prey, animal, comes, to, resemble, even, slightly, a, distasteful, animal, natural, selection, favours, those, individuals, that, even, very, slightly, better, resemble, the, distasteful, species, this, is, because, even, a, small, degree, of, protection, reduces, predation, and, increases, the, chance, that, an, individual, mimic, will, survive, and, reproduce, for, example, many, species, of, hoverfly, are, coloured, black, and, yellow, like, bees, and, are, in, consequence, avoided, by, birds, and, people, m, llerian, mimicry, was, first, described, by, the, pioneering, naturalist, fritz, m, ller, when, a, distasteful, animal, comes, to, resemble, a, more, common, distasteful, animal, natural, selection, favours, individuals, that, even, very, slightly, better, resemble, the, target, for, example, many, species, of, stinging, wasp, and, bee, are, similarly, coloured, black, and, yellow, m, ller, s, explanation, of, the, mechanism, for, this, was, one, of, the, first, uses, of, mathematics, in, biology, he, argued, that, a, predator, such, as, a, young, bird, must, attack, at, least, one, insect, say, a, wasp, to, learn, that, the, black, and, yellow, colours, mean, a, stinging, insect, if, bees, were, differently, coloured, the, young, bird, would, have, to, attack, one, of, them, also, but, when, bees, and, wasps, resemble, each, other, the, young, bird, need, only, attack, one, from, the, whole, group, to, learn, to, avoid, all, of, them, so, fewer, bees, are, attacked, if, they, mimic, wasps, the, same, applies, to, wasps, that, mimic, bees, the, result, is, mutual, resemblance, for, mutual, protection, some, animals, such, as, many, moths, mantises, and, grasshoppers, have, a, repertoire, of, threatening, or, startling, behaviour, such, as, suddenly, displaying, conspicuous, eyespots, or, patches, of, bright, and, contrasting, colours, so, as, to, scare, off, or, momentarily, distract, a, predator, this, gives, the, prey, animal, an, opportunity, to, escape, the, behaviour, is, deimatic, startling, rather, than, aposematic, as, these, insects, are, palatable, to, predators, so, the, warning, colours, are, a, bluff, not, an, honest, signal, some, prey, animals, such, as, zebra, are, marked, with, high, contrast, patterns, which, possibly, help, to, confuse, their, predators, such, as, lions, during, a, chase, the, bold, stripes, of, a, herd, of, running, zebra, have, been, claimed, make, it, difficult, for, predators, to, estimate, the, prey, s, speed, and, direction, accurately, or, to, identify, individual, animals, giving, the, prey, an, improved, chance, of, escape, since, dazzle, patterns, such, as, the, zebra, s, stripes, make, animals, harder, to, catch, when, moving, but, easier, to, detect, when, stationary, there, is, an, evolutionary, trade, off, between, dazzle, and, camouflage, there, is, evidence, that, the, zebra, s, stripes, could, provide, some, protection, from, flies, and, biting, insects, many, animals, have, dark, pigments, such, as, melanin, in, their, skin, eyes, and, fur, to, protect, themselves, against, sunburn, damage, to, living, tissues, caused, by, ultraviolet, light, another, example, of, photoprotective, pigments, are, the, gfp, like, proteins, in, some, corals, in, some, jellyfish, rhizostomins, have, also, been, hypothesized, to, protect, against, ultraviolet, damage, some, frogs, such, as, bokermannohyla, alvarengai, which, basks, in, sunlight, lighten, their, skin, colour, when, hot, and, darkens, when, cold, making, their, skin, reflect, more, heat, and, so, avoid, overheating, some, animals, are, coloured, purely, incidentally, because, their, blood, contains, pigments, for, example, amphibians, like, the, olm, that, live, in, caves, may, be, largely, colorless, as, colour, has, no, function, in, that, environment, but, they, show, some, red, because, of, the, haem, pigment, in, their, red, blood, cells, needed, to, carry, oxygen, they, also, have, a, little, orange, coloured, riboflavin, in, their, skin, human, albinos, and, people, with, fair, skin, have, a, similar, colour, for, the, same, reason, animal, coloration, may, be, the, result, of, any, combination, of, pigments, chromatophores, structural, coloration, and, bioluminescence, pigments, are, coloured, chemicals, such, as, melanin, in, animal, tissues, for, example, the, arctic, fox, has, a, white, coat, in, winter, containing, little, pigment, and, a, brown, coat, in, summer, containing, more, pigment, an, example, of, seasonal, camouflage, a, polyphenism, many, animals, including, mammals, birds, and, amphibians, are, unable, to, synthesize, most, of, the, pigments, that, colour, their, fur, or, feathers, other, than, the, brown, or, black, melanins, that, give, many, mammals, their, earth, tones, for, example, the, bright, yellow, of, an, american, goldfinch, the, startling, orange, of, a, juvenile, red, spotted, newt, the, deep, red, of, a, cardinal, and, the, pink, of, a, flamingo, are, all, produced, by, carotenoid, pigments, synthesized, by, plants, in, the, case, of, the, flamingo, the, bird, eats, pink, shrimps, which, are, themselves, unable, to, synthesize, carotenoids, the, shrimps, derive, their, body, colour, from, microscopic, red, algae, which, like, most, plants, are, able, to, create, their, own, pigments, including, both, carotenoids, and, green, chlorophyll, animals, that, eat, green, plants, do, not, become, green, however, as, chlorophyll, does, not, survive, digestion, chromatophores, are, special, pigment, containing, cells, that, may, change, their, size, but, more, often, retain, their, original, size, but, allow, the, pigment, within, them, to, become, redistributed, thus, varying, the, colour, and, pattern, of, the, animal, chromatophores, may, respond, to, hormonal, and, or, neurobal, control, mechanisms, but, direst, responses, to, stimulation, by, visible, light, uv, radiation, temperature, ph, changes, chemicals, etc, have, also, been, documented, the, voluntary, control, of, chromatophores, is, known, as, metachrosis, for, example, cuttlefish, and, chameleons, can, rapidly, change, their, appearance, both, for, camouflage, and, for, signalling, as, aristotle, first, noted, over, 2000, years, ago, the, octopus, seeks, its, prey, by, so, changing, its, colour, as, to, render, it, like, the, colour, of, the, stones, adjacent, to, it, it, does, so, also, when, alarmed, when, cephalopod, molluscs, like, squid, and, cuttlefish, find, themselves, against, a, light, background, they, contract, many, of, their, chromatophores, concentrating, the, pigment, into, a, smaller, area, resulting, in, a, pattern, of, tiny, dense, but, widely, spaced, dots, appearing, light, when, they, enter, a, darker, environment, they, allow, their, chromatophores, to, expand, creating, a, pattern, of, larger, dark, spots, and, making, their, bodies, appear, dark, amphibians, such, as, frogs, have, three, kinds, of, star, shaped, chromatophore, cells, in, separate, layers, of, their, skin, the, top, layer, contains, xanthophores, with, orange, red, or, yellow, pigments, the, middle, layer, contains, iridophores, with, a, silvery, light, reflecting, pigment, while, the, bottom, layer, contains, melanophores, with, dark, melanin, while, many, animals, are, unable, to, synthesize, carotenoid, pigments, to, create, red, and, yellow, surfaces, the, green, and, blue, colours, of, bird, feathers, and, insect, carapaces, are, usually, not, produced, by, pigments, at, all, but, by, structural, coloration, structural, coloration, means, the, production, of, colour, by, microscopically, structured, surfaces, fine, enough, to, interfere, with, visible, light, sometimes, in, combination, with, pigments, for, example, peacock, tail, feathers, are, pigmented, brown, but, their, structure, makes, them, appear, blue, turquoise, and, green, structural, coloration, can, produce, the, most, brilliant, colours, often, iridescent, for, example, the, blue, green, gloss, on, the, plumage, of, birds, such, as, ducks, and, the, purple, blue, green, red, colours, of, many, beetles, and, butterflies, are, created, by, structural, coloration, animals, use, several, methods, to, produce, structural, colour, as, described, in, the, table, bioluminescence, is, the, production, of, light, such, as, by, the, photophores, of, marine, animals, and, the, tails, of, glow, worms, and, fireflies, bioluminescence, like, other, forms, of, metabolism, releases, energy, derived, from, the, chemical, energy, of, food, a, pigment, luciferin, is, catalysed, by, the, enzyme, luciferase, to, react, with, oxygen, releasing, light, comb, jellies, such, as, euplokamis, are, bioluminescent, creating, blue, and, green, light, especially, when, stressed, when, disturbed, they, secrete, an, ink, which, luminesces, in, the, same, colours, since, comb, jellies, are, not, very, sensitive, to, light, their, bioluminescence, is, unlikely, to, be, used, to, signal, to, other, members, of, the, same, species, e, g, to, attract, mates, or, repel, rivals, more, likely, the, light, helps, to, distract, predators, or, parasites, some, species, of, squid, have, light, producing, organs, photophores, scattered, all, over, their, undersides, that, create, a, sparkling, glow, this, provides, counter, illumination, camouflage, preventing, the, animal, from, appearing, as, a, dark, shape, when, seen, from, below, some, anglerfish, of, the, deep, sea, where, it, is, too, dark, to, hunt, by, sight, contain, symbiotic, bacteria, in, the, bait, on, their, fishing, rods, these, emit, light, to, attract, prey
