in, biology, tissue, is, an, assembly, of, similar, cells, and, their, extracellular, matrix, from, the, same, embryonic, origin, that, together, carry, out, a, specific, function, tissues, occupy, a, biological, organizational, level, between, cells, and, a, complete, organ, accordingly, organs, are, formed, by, the, functional, grouping, together, of, multiple, tissues, biological, organisms, follow, this, hierarchy, cells, tissue, organ, organ, system, organism, the, english, word, tissue, derives, from, the, french, word, tissu, the, past, participle, of, the, verb, tisser, to, weave, the, study, of, tissues, is, known, as, histology, or, in, connection, with, disease, as, histopathology, xavier, bichat, is, considered, as, the, father, of, histology, plant, histology, is, studied, in, both, plant, anatomy, and, physiology, the, classical, tools, for, studying, tissues, are, the, paraffin, block, in, which, tissue, is, embedded, and, then, sectioned, the, histological, stain, and, the, optical, microscope, developments, in, electron, microscopy, immunofluorescence, and, the, use, of, frozen, tissue, sections, have, enhanced, the, detail, that, can, be, observed, in, tissues, with, these, tools, the, classical, appearances, of, tissues, can, be, examined, in, health, and, disease, enabling, considerable, refinement, of, medical, diagnosis, and, prognosis, in, plant, anatomy, tissues, are, categorized, broadly, into, three, tissue, systems, the, epidermis, the, ground, tissue, and, the, vascular, tissue, plant, tissues, can, also, be, divided, differently, into, two, types, meristematic, tissue, consists, of, actively, dividing, cells, and, leads, to, increase, in, length, and, thickness, of, the, plant, the, primary, growth, of, a, plant, occurs, only, in, certain, specific, regions, such, as, in, the, tips, of, stems, or, roots, it, is, in, these, regions, that, meristematic, tissue, is, present, cells, of, this, type, of, tissue, are, roughly, spherical, or, polyhedral, to, rectangular, in, shape, with, thin, cell, walls, new, cells, produced, by, meristem, are, initially, those, of, meristem, itself, but, as, the, new, cells, grow, and, mature, their, characteristics, slowly, change, and, they, become, differentiated, as, components, of, meristematic, tissue, being, classified, as, there, are, two, types, of, meristematic, tissue, 1, primary, meristem, 2, secondary, meristem, the, cells, of, meristematic, tissue, are, similar, in, structure, and, have, a, thin, and, elastic, primary, cell, wall, made, of, cellulose, they, are, compactly, arranged, without, inter, cellular, spaces, between, them, each, cell, contains, a, dense, cytoplasm, and, a, prominent, cell, nucleus, the, dense, protoplasm, of, meristematic, cells, contains, very, few, vacuoles, normally, the, meristematic, cells, are, oval, polygonal, or, rectangular, in, shape, meristematic, tissue, cells, have, a, large, nucleus, with, small, or, no, vacuoles, because, they, have, no, need, to, store, anything, as, opposed, to, their, function, of, multiplying, and, increasing, the, girth, and, length, of, the, plant, with, no, intercellular, spaces, permanent, tissues, may, be, defined, as, a, group, of, living, or, dead, cells, formed, by, meristematic, tissue, and, have, lost, their, ability, to, divide, and, have, permanently, placed, at, fixed, positions, in, the, plant, body, meristematic, tissues, that, take, up, a, specific, role, lose, the, ability, to, divide, this, process, of, taking, up, a, permanent, shape, size, and, a, function, is, called, cellular, differentiation, cells, of, meristematic, tissue, differentiate, to, form, different, types, of, permanent, tissues, there, are, 2, types, of, permanent, tissues, simple, permanent, tissue, is, a, group, of, cells, which, are, similar, in, origin, structure, and, function, they, are, of, three, types, parenchyma, greek, para, beside, enchyma, infusion, tissue, is, the, bulk, of, a, substance, in, plants, it, consists, of, relatively, unspecialized, living, cells, with, thin, cell, walls, that, are, usually, loosely, packed, so, that, intercellular, spaces, are, found, between, cells, of, this, tissue, these, are, generally, isodiametric, in, shape, they, contain, small, number, of, vacuoles, or, sometimes, they, even, may, not, contain, any, vacuole, even, if, they, do, so, the, vacuole, is, of, much, smaller, size, than, of, normal, animal, cells, this, tissue, provides, support, to, plants, and, also, stores, food, chlorenchyma, is, a, special, type, of, parenchyma, that, contains, chlorophyll, and, performs, photosynthesis, in, aquatic, plants, aerenchyma, tissues, or, large, air, cavities, give, support, to, float, on, water, by, making, them, buoyant, parenchyma, cells, called, idioblasts, have, metabolic, waste, spindle, shaped, fibers, are, also, present, in, this, cell, to, support, them, and, known, as, prosenchyma, succulent, parenchyma, also, noted, in, xerophytes, parenchyma, tissues, store, water, collenchyma, greek, colla, means, gum, and, enchyma, means, infusion, is, a, living, tissue, of, primary, body, like, parenchyma, cells, are, thin, walled, but, possess, thickening, of, cellulose, water, and, pectin, substances, pectocellulose, at, the, corners, where, a, number, of, cells, join, this, tissue, gives, tensile, strength, to, the, plant, and, the, cells, are, compactly, arranged, and, have, very, little, inter, cellular, spaces, it, occurs, chiefly, in, hypodermis, of, stems, and, leaves, it, is, absent, in, monocots, and, in, roots, collenchymatous, tissue, acts, as, a, supporting, tissue, in, stems, of, young, plants, it, provides, mechanical, support, elasticity, and, tensile, strength, to, the, plant, body, it, helps, in, manufacturing, sugar, and, storing, it, as, starch, it, is, present, in, the, margin, of, leaves, and, resists, tearing, effect, of, the, wind, sclerenchyma, greek, sclerous, means, hard, and, enchyma, means, infusion, consists, of, thick, walled, dead, cells, and, protoplasm, is, negligible, these, cells, have, hard, and, extremely, thick, secondary, walls, due, to, uniform, distribution, and, high, secretion, of, lignin, and, have, a, function, of, providing, mechanical, support, they, do, not, have, inter, cellular, spaces, between, them, lignin, deposition, is, so, thick, that, the, cell, walls, become, stronger, rigid, and, impermeable, to, water, which, are, also, known, as, a, stone, cells, or, sclereids, these, tissues, are, mainly, of, two, types, sclerenchyma, fiber, and, sclereids, sclerenchyma, fiber, cells, have, a, narrow, lumen, and, are, long, narrow, and, unicellular, fibers, are, elongated, cells, that, are, strong, and, flexible, often, used, in, ropes, sclereids, have, extremely, thick, cell, walls, and, are, brittle, and, are, found, in, nutshells, and, legumes, the, entire, surface, of, the, plant, consists, of, a, single, layer, of, cells, called, epidermis, or, surface, tissue, the, entire, surface, of, the, plant, has, this, outer, layer, of, the, epidermis, hence, it, is, also, called, surface, tissue, most, of, the, epidermal, cells, are, relatively, flat, the, outer, and, lateral, walls, of, the, cell, are, often, thicker, than, the, inner, walls, the, cells, form, a, continuous, sheet, without, intercellular, spaces, it, protects, all, parts, of, the, plant, the, outer, epidermis, is, coated, with, a, waxy, thick, layer, called, cutin, which, prevents, loss, of, water, the, epidermis, also, consists, of, stomata, singular, stoma, which, helps, in, transpiration, the, complex, permanent, tissue, consists, of, more, than, one, type, of, cells, having, a, common, origin, which, work, together, as, a, unit, complex, tissues, are, mainly, concerned, with, the, transportation, of, mineral, nutrients, organic, solutes, food, materials, and, water, that, s, why, it, is, also, known, as, conducting, and, vascular, tissue, the, common, types, of, complex, permanent, tissue, are, xylem, and, phloem, together, form, vascular, bundles, xylem, greek, xylos, wood, serves, as, a, chief, conducting, tissue, of, vascular, plants, it, is, responsible, for, the, conduction, of, water, and, inorganic, solutes, xylem, consists, of, four, kinds, of, cells, xylem, tissue, is, organised, in, a, tube, like, fashion, along, the, main, axes, of, stems, and, roots, it, consists, of, a, combination, of, parenchyma, cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and, ray, cells, longer, tubes, made, up, of, individual, cellssels, tracheids, while, vessel, members, are, open, at, each, end, internally, there, may, be, bars, of, wall, material, extending, across, the, open, space, these, cells, are, joined, end, to, end, to, form, long, tubes, vessel, members, and, tracheids, are, dead, at, maturity, tracheids, have, thick, secondary, cell, walls, and, are, tapered, at, the, ends, they, do, not, have, end, openings, such, as, the, vessels, the, end, overlap, with, each, other, with, pairs, of, pits, present, the, pit, pairs, allow, water, to, pass, from, cell, to, cell, though, most, conduction, in, xylem, tissue, is, vertical, lateral, conduction, along, the, diameter, of, a, stem, is, facilitated, via, rays, rays, are, horizontal, rows, of, long, living, parenchyma, cells, that, arise, out, of, the, vascular, cambium, phloem, consists, of, phloem, is, an, equally, important, plant, tissue, as, it, also, is, part, of, the, plumbing, system, of, a, plant, primarily, phloem, carries, dissolved, food, substances, throughout, the, plant, this, conduction, system, is, composed, of, sieve, tube, member, and, companion, cells, that, are, without, secondary, walls, the, parent, cells, of, the, vascular, cambium, produce, both, xylem, and, phloem, this, usually, also, includes, fibers, parenchyma, and, ray, cells, sieve, tubes, are, formed, from, sieve, tube, members, laid, end, to, end, the, end, walls, unlike, vessel, members, in, xylem, do, not, have, openings, the, end, walls, however, are, full, of, small, pores, where, cytoplasm, extends, from, cell, to, cell, these, porous, connections, are, called, sieve, plates, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, their, cytoplasm, is, actively, involved, in, the, conduction, of, food, materials, sieve, tube, members, do, not, have, nuclei, at, maturity, it, is, the, companion, cells, that, are, nestled, between, sieve, tube, members, that, function, in, some, manner, bringing, about, the, conduction, of, food, sieve, tube, members, that, are, alive, contain, a, polymer, called, callose, a, carbohydrate, polymer, forming, the, callus, pad, callus, the, colourless, substance, that, covers, the, sieve, plate, callose, stays, in, solution, as, long, as, the, cell, contents, are, under, pressure, phloem, transports, food, and, materials, in, plants, upwards, and, downwards, as, required, animal, tissues, are, grouped, into, four, basic, types, connective, muscle, nervous, and, epithelial, collections, of, tissues, joined, in, units, to, serve, a, common, function, compose, organs, while, most, animals, can, generally, be, considered, to, contain, the, four, tissue, types, the, manifestation, of, these, tissues, can, differ, depending, on, the, type, of, organism, for, example, the, origin, of, the, cells, comprising, a, particular, tissue, type, may, differ, developmentally, for, different, classifications, of, animals, tissue, appeared, for, the, first, time, in, the, diploblasts, but, modern, forms, only, appeared, in, triploblasts, the, epithelium, in, all, animals, is, derived, from, the, ectoderm, and, endoderm, or, their, precursor, in, sponges, with, a, small, contribution, from, the, mesoderm, forming, the, endothelium, a, specialized, type, of, epithelium, that, composes, the, vasculature, by, contrast, a, true, epithelial, tissue, is, present, only, in, a, single, layer, of, cells, held, together, via, occluding, junctions, called, tight, junctions, to, create, a, selectively, permeable, barrier, this, tissue, covers, all, organismal, surfaces, that, come, in, contact, with, the, external, environment, such, as, the, skin, the, airways, and, the, digestive, tract, it, serves, functions, of, protection, secretion, and, absorption, and, is, separated, from, other, tissues, below, by, a, basal, lamina, the, connective, tissue, and, the, muscular, are, derived, from, the, mesoderm, the, nervous, tissue, is, derived, from, the, ectoderm, the, epithelial, tissues, are, formed, by, cells, that, cover, the, organ, surfaces, such, as, the, surface, of, skin, the, airways, surfaces, of, soft, organs, the, reproductive, tract, and, the, inner, lining, of, the, digestive, tract, the, cells, comprising, an, epithelial, layer, are, linked, via, semi, permeable, tight, junctions, hence, this, tissue, provides, a, barrier, between, the, external, environment, and, the, organ, it, covers, in, addition, to, this, protective, function, epithelial, tissue, may, also, be, specialized, to, function, in, secretion, excretion, and, absorption, epithelial, tissue, helps, to, protect, organs, from, microorganisms, injury, and, fluid, loss, functions, of, epithelial, tissue, there, are, many, kinds, of, epithelium, and, nomenclature, is, somewhat, variable, most, classification, schemes, combine, a, description, of, the, cell, shape, in, the, upper, layer, of, the, epithelium, with, a, word, denoting, the, number, of, layers, either, simple, one, layer, of, cells, or, stratified, multiple, layers, of, cells, however, other, cellular, features, such, as, cilia, may, also, be, described, in, the, classification, system, some, common, kinds, of, epithelium, are, listed, below, connective, tissues, are, made, up, of, cells, separated, by, non, living, material, which, is, called, an, extracellular, matrix, this, matrix, can, be, liquid, or, rigid, for, example, blood, contains, plasma, as, its, matrix, and, bone, s, matrix, is, rigid, connective, tissue, gives, shape, to, organs, and, holds, them, in, place, blood, bone, tendon, ligament, adipose, and, areolar, tissues, are, examples, of, connective, tissues, one, method, of, classifying, connective, tissues, is, to, divide, them, into, three, types, fibrous, connective, tissue, skeletal, connective, tissue, and, fluid, connective, tissue, muscle, cells, myocytes, form, the, active, contractile, tissue, of, the, body, muscle, tissue, functions, to, produce, force, and, cause, motion, either, locomotion, or, movement, within, internal, organs, muscle, is, formed, of, contractile, filaments, and, is, separated, into, three, main, types, smooth, muscle, skeletal, muscle, and, cardiac, muscle, smooth, muscle, has, no, striations, when, examined, microscopically, it, contracts, slowly, but, maintains, contractibility, over, a, wide, range, of, stretch, lengths, it, is, found, in, such, organs, as, sea, anemone, tentacles, and, the, body, wall, of, sea, cucumbers, skeletal, muscle, contracts, rapidly, but, has, a, limited, range, of, extension, it, is, found, in, the, movement, of, appendages, and, jaws, obliquely, striated, muscle, is, intermediate, between, the, other, two, the, filaments, are, staggered, and, this, is, the, type, of, muscle, found, in, earthworms, that, can, extend, slowly, or, make, rapid, contractions, in, higher, animals, striated, muscles, occur, in, bundles, attached, to, bone, to, provide, movement, and, are, often, arranged, in, antagonistic, sets, smooth, muscle, is, found, in, the, walls, of, the, uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory, airways, and, blood, vessels, cardiac, muscle, is, found, only, in, the, heart, allowing, it, to, contract, and, pump, blood, through, the, body, cells, comprising, the, central, nervous, system, and, peripheral, nervous, system, are, classified, as, nervous, or, neural, tissue, in, the, central, nervous, system, neural, tissues, form, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, in, the, peripheral, nervous, system, neural, tissues, form, the, cranial, nerves, and, spinal, nerves, inclusive, of, the, motor, neurons, mineralized, tissues, are, biological, tissues, that, incorporate, minerals, into, soft, matrices, such, tissues, may, be, found, in, both, plants, and, animals, xavier, bichat, introduced, the, word, tissue, into, the, study, of, anatomy, by, 1801, he, was, the, first, to, propose, that, tissue, is, a, central, element, in, human, anatomy, and, he, considered, organs, as, collections, of, often, disparate, tissues, rather, than, as, entities, in, themselves, although, he, worked, without, a, microscope, bichat, distinguished, 21, types, of, elementary, tissues, from, which, the, organs, of, the, human, body, are, composed, a, number, later, reduced, by, other, authors
