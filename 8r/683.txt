the, american, robin, turdus, migratorius, is, a, migratory, bird, of, the, true, thrush, genus, and, turdidae, the, wider, thrush, family, it, is, named, after, the, european, robin, because, of, its, reddish, orange, breast, though, the, two, species, are, not, closely, related, with, the, european, robin, belonging, to, the, old, world, flycatcher, family, the, american, robin, is, widely, distributed, throughout, north, america, wintering, from, southern, canada, to, central, mexico, and, along, the, pacific, coast, according, to, the, partners, in, flight, database, 2019, the, american, robin, is, the, most, abundant, landbird, in, north, america, with, 370, million, individuals, ahead, of, red, winged, blackbirds, introduced, european, starlings, mourning, doves, and, house, finches, it, has, seven, subspecies, but, only, one, of, them, the, san, lucas, robin, t, m, confinis, of, baja, california, sur, is, particularly, distinctive, with, light, gray, upper, parts, and, a, pale, beige, breast, the, american, robin, is, active, mostly, during, the, day, and, assembles, in, large, flocks, at, night, its, diet, consists, of, invertebrates, such, as, beetle, grubs, earthworms, and, caterpillars, fruits, and, berries, it, is, one, of, the, earliest, bird, species, to, lay, its, eggs, beginning, to, breed, shortly, after, returning, to, its, summer, range, from, its, winter, range, the, robin, s, nest, consists, of, long, coarse, grass, twigs, paper, and, feathers, and, is, smeared, with, mud, and, often, cushioned, with, grass, or, other, soft, materials, it, is, among, the, earliest, birds, to, sing, at, dawn, and, its, song, consists, of, several, discrete, units, that, are, repeated, the, adult, robin, s, main, predator, is, the, domestic, cat, other, predators, include, hawks, and, snakes, when, feeding, in, flocks, it, can, be, vigilant, watching, other, birds, for, reactions, to, predators, brown, headed, cowbirds, molothrus, ater, lay, their, eggs, in, robin, nests, see, brood, parasite, but, the, robins, usually, reject, the, egg, this, species, was, first, described, in, 1766, by, carl, linnaeus, in, the, twelfth, edition, of, his, systema, naturae, as, turdus, migratorius, the, binomial, name, derives, from, two, latin, words, turdus, thrush, and, migratorius, from, migrare, to, migrate, the, term, robin, for, this, species, has, been, recorded, since, at, least, 1703, there, are, about, 65, species, of, medium, to, large, thrushes, in, the, genus, turdus, characterized, by, rounded, heads, longish, pointed, wings, and, usually, melodious, songs, a, study, of, the, mitochondrial, cytochrome, b, gene, indicates, that, the, american, robin, is, not, part, of, the, central, south, american, clade, of, turdus, thrushes, instead, it, shows, genetic, similarities, to, the, kurrichane, thrush, t, libonyanus, and, the, olive, thrush, t, olivaceus, both, african, species, this, conflicts, with, a, 2007, dna, study, of, 60, of, 65, turdus, species, which, places, the, american, robin, s, closest, relative, as, the, rufous, collared, thrush, t, rufitorques, of, central, america, though, having, distinct, plumage, the, two, species, are, similar, in, vocalization, and, behavior, beyond, this, it, lies, in, a, small, group, of, four, species, of, otherwise, central, american, distribution, suggesting, it, recently, spread, northwards, into, north, america, seven, subspecies, of, american, robin, are, recognized, these, subspecies, intergrade, with, each, other, and, are, only, weakly, defined, the, eastern, subspecies, of, the, american, robin, t, m, migratorius, is, 23, to, 28, cm, 9, 1, to, 11, 0, in, long, with, a, wingspan, ranging, from, 31, to, 41, cm, 12, to, 16, in, with, similar, size, ranges, across, all, subspecies, the, species, averages, about, 77, g, 2, 7, oz, in, weight, with, males, ranging, from, 72, to, 94, g, 2, 5, to, 3, 3, oz, and, females, ranging, from, 59, to, 91, g, 2, 1, to, 3, 2, oz, among, standard, measurements, the, wing, chord, is, 11, 5, to, 14, 5, cm, 4, 5, to, 5, 7, in, the, culmen, is, 1, 8, to, 2, 2, cm, 0, 71, to, 0, 87, in, and, the, tarsus, is, 2, 9, to, 3, 3, cm, 1, 1, to, 1, 3, in, the, head, varies, from, jet, black, to, gray, with, white, eye, arcs, and, white, supercilia, the, throat, is, white, with, black, streaks, and, the, belly, and, undertail, coverts, are, white, the, american, robin, has, a, brown, back, and, a, reddish, orange, breast, varying, from, a, rich, red, maroon, to, peachy, orange, the, bill, is, mainly, yellow, with, a, variably, dark, tip, the, dusky, area, becoming, more, extensive, in, winter, and, the, legs, and, feet, are, brown, the, sexes, are, similar, but, females, tend, to, be, duller, in, color, than, males, with, a, brown, tint, to, the, head, brown, upperparts, and, less, bright, underparts, however, some, birds, cannot, be, accurately, sexed, on, the, sole, basis, of, plumage, juveniles, are, paler, in, color, than, adult, males, and, have, dark, spots, on, their, breasts, and, whitish, wing, coverts, first, year, birds, are, not, easily, distinguishable, from, adults, but, they, tend, to, be, duller, and, a, small, percentage, retain, a, few, juvenile, wing, coverts, or, other, feathers, the, american, robin, breeds, throughout, most, of, north, america, from, alaska, and, canada, southward, to, northern, florida, and, mexico, while, robins, occasionally, overwinter, in, the, northern, part, of, the, united, states, and, southern, canada, most, migrate, to, winter, south, of, canada, from, florida, and, the, gulf, coast, to, central, mexico, as, well, as, along, the, pacific, coast, most, depart, south, by, the, end, of, august, and, begin, to, return, north, in, february, and, march, exact, dates, vary, with, latitude, and, climate, the, distance, by, which, robins, migrate, varies, significantly, depending, on, their, initial, habitat, a, study, found, that, individual, robins, tagged, in, alaska, are, known, to, travel, as, much, as, 3, 5x, further, across, seasons, than, robins, tagged, in, massachusetts, this, species, is, actually, a, rare, vagrant, to, western, europe, where, the, majority, of, records, more, than, 20, have, been, in, great, britain, in, the, autumn, of, 2003, migration, was, displaced, eastwards, leading, to, massive, movements, through, the, eastern, u, s, and, presumably, this, is, what, led, to, no, fewer, than, three, american, robins, being, found, in, great, britain, with, two, attempting, to, overwinter, in, 2003, 2004, although, one, was, taken, by, a, eurasian, sparrowhawk, a, sighting, occurred, in, great, britain, in, january, 2007, this, species, has, also, occurred, as, a, vagrant, to, greenland, jamaica, hispaniola, puerto, rico, and, belize, vagrants, to, europe, where, identified, to, subspecies, are, the, eastern, subspecies, t, m, migratorius, but, the, greenland, birds, also, included, the, newfoundland, subspecies, t, m, nigrideus, and, some, of, the, southern, overshots, may, have, been, the, southern, subspecies, t, m, achrusterus, the, american, robin, s, breeding, habitat, is, woodland, and, more, open, farmland, and, urban, areas, it, becomes, less, common, as, a, breeder, in, the, southernmost, part, of, the, deep, south, of, the, united, states, and, there, prefers, large, shade, trees, on, lawns, its, winter, habitat, is, similar, but, includes, more, open, areas, the, american, robin, is, a, known, reservoir, carrier, for, west, nile, virus, spread, by, culex, mosquitoes, while, crows, and, jays, are, often, the, first, noticed, deaths, in, an, area, with, west, nile, virus, the, american, robin, is, suspected, to, be, a, key, host, and, holds, a, larger, responsibility, for, the, transmission, of, the, virus, to, humans, this, is, because, while, crows, and, jays, die, quickly, from, the, virus, the, american, robin, survives, the, virus, longer, hence, spreading, it, to, more, mosquitoes, which, then, transmit, the, virus, to, humans, and, other, species, a, successful, west, nile, virus, vaccine, has, been, administered, to, six, 3, 5, week, old, american, robins, a, dna, vaccine, injected, intramuscularly, resulted, in, a, 400, fold, decrease, in, average, viral, load, that, would, likely, make, robins, noninfectious, and, unable, to, spread, disease, an, oral, bait, is, the, preferred, method, of, distribution, of, the, vaccine, as, it, would, be, easier, and, cheaper, than, intramuscular, injection, but, more, research, would, be, needed, as, the, existing, formulation, did, not, work, orally, the, american, robin, is, active, mostly, during, the, day, and, on, its, winter, grounds, it, assembles, in, large, flocks, at, night, to, roost, in, trees, in, secluded, swamps, or, dense, vegetation, the, flocks, break, up, during, the, day, when, the, birds, feed, on, fruits, and, berries, in, smaller, groups, during, the, summer, the, american, robin, defends, a, breeding, territory, and, is, less, social, the, american, robin, s, diet, generally, consists, of, around, 40, percent, small, invertebrates, mainly, insects, such, as, earthworms, beetle, grubs, caterpillars, and, grasshoppers, and, 60, percent, wild, and, cultivated, fruits, and, berries, their, ability, to, switch, to, berries, allows, them, to, winter, much, farther, north, than, most, other, north, american, thrushes, they, will, flock, to, fermented, pyracantha, berries, and, after, eating, sufficient, quantities, will, exhibit, intoxicated, behavior, such, as, falling, over, while, walking, robins, forage, primarily, on, the, ground, for, soft, bodied, invertebrates, and, find, worms, by, sight, and, sometimes, by, hearing, 149, pouncing, on, them, and, then, pulling, them, up, nestlings, are, fed, mainly, on, earthworms, and, other, soft, bodied, animal, prey, in, some, areas, robins, particularly, of, the, northwestern, subspecies, t, m, caurinus, will, feed, on, beaches, taking, insects, and, small, mollusks, american, robins, are, common, pests, of, fruit, orchards, in, north, america, due, to, their, insectivorous, and, frugivorous, diet, they, have, evolved, to, lose, sucrase, sucrose, is, unpalatable, to, them, and, can, be, used, by, humans, as, a, deterrent, the, american, robin, uses, auditory, visual, olfactory, and, possibly, vibrotactile, cues, to, find, prey, but, vision, is, the, predominant, mode, of, prey, detection, it, is, frequently, seen, running, across, lawns, picking, up, earthworms, and, its, running, and, stopping, behavior, is, a, distinguishing, characteristic, in, addition, to, hunting, visually, it, also, has, the, ability, to, hunt, by, hearing, experiments, have, shown, that, it, can, find, earthworms, underground, by, simply, using, its, listening, skills, 149, it, typically, will, take, several, short, hops, and, then, cock, its, head, left, right, or, forward, to, detect, movement, of, its, prey, in, urban, areas, robins, will, gather, in, numbers, soon, after, lawns, are, mowed, or, where, sprinklers, are, in, use, juvenile, robins, and, eggs, are, preyed, upon, by, squirrels, snakes, and, some, birds, such, as, blue, jays, california, scrub, jays, steller, s, jays, common, grackles, american, crows, and, common, ravens, adults, are, primarily, taken, by, accipiter, hawks, cats, and, larger, snakes, especially, rat, snakes, and, gopher, snakes, mammals, such, as, foxes, and, dogs, are, mainly, likely, to, grab, fledgling, young, robins, from, the, ground, while, raccoons, often, prey, upon, nests, and, small, carnivores, such, as, american, martens, ring, tailed, cats, and, long, tailed, weasels, are, agile, enough, to, hunt, adults, however, the, greatest, predatory, impact, perhaps, alongside, domestic, cats, is, probably, from, raptorial, birds, they, may, be, taken, by, nearly, every, variety, of, north, american, accipitrid, from, the, smallest, the, sharp, shinned, hawk, to, one, of, the, two, largest, the, golden, eagle, most, every, north, american, falcon, from, the, smallest, the, american, kestrel, to, the, largest, the, gyrfalcon, and, almost, all, owl, species, from, the, northern, pygmy, owl, to, the, snowy, owl, overall, 28, raptorial, bird, species, are, known, to, hunt, american, robins, adult, robins, are, most, vulnerable, when, distracted, by, breeding, activities, though, they, may, also, be, attacked, on, the, ground, or, even, in, flight, however, when, feeding, in, flocks, the, american, robin, is, able, to, remain, vigilant, and, watch, other, flock, members, for, reactions, to, predators, the, american, robin, is, known, to, be, a, rejecter, of, cowbird, eggs, so, brood, parasitism, by, the, brown, headed, cowbird, is, rare, even, when, it, occurs, the, parasite, s, chick, does, not, normally, survive, to, fledge, in, a, study, of, 105, juvenile, robins, 77, 1, were, infected, with, one, or, more, species, of, endoparasite, with, syngamus, species, the, most, commonly, encountered, found, in, 57, 1, of, the, birds, the, american, robin, begins, to, breed, shortly, after, returning, to, its, summer, range, it, is, one, of, the, first, north, american, bird, species, to, lay, eggs, and, normally, has, two, to, three, broods, per, breeding, season, which, lasts, from, april, to, july, the, nest, is, most, commonly, located, 1, 5, 4, 5, m, 4, 9, 14, 8, ft, above, the, ground, in, a, dense, bush, or, in, a, fork, between, two, tree, branches, and, is, built, by, the, female, alone, the, outer, foundation, consists, of, long, coarse, grass, twigs, paper, and, feathers, this, is, lined, with, smeared, mud, and, cushioned, with, fine, grass, or, other, soft, materials, the, american, robin, builds, a, new, nest, for, each, brood, in, northern, areas, the, nest, for, the, first, clutch, will, usually, be, located, in, an, evergreen, tree, or, shrub, while, later, broods, are, raised, in, deciduous, trees, the, species, is, not, shy, about, nesting, close, to, human, habitations, a, clutch, consists, of, three, to, five, cyan, colored, eggs, and, is, incubated, by, the, female, alone, the, eggs, hatch, after, 14, days, and, the, chicks, leave, the, nest, a, further, two, weeks, later, the, altricial, chicks, are, naked, and, have, their, eyes, closed, for, the, first, few, days, after, hatching, the, chicks, are, fed, earthworms, insects, and, berries, waste, accumulation, does, not, occur, in, the, nest, because, the, adults, collect, and, take, it, away, chicks, are, fed, and, then, raise, tails, for, elimination, of, waste, a, solid, white, clump, that, is, collected, by, a, parent, prior, to, flying, off, all, chicks, in, the, brood, leave, the, nest, within, two, days, of, each, other, juveniles, become, capable, of, sustained, flight, two, weeks, after, fledging, chicks, become, sexually, mature, at, one, year, of, age, bird, banders, have, found, that, only, 25, of, young, robins, survive, their, first, year, the, longest, known, lifespan, of, an, american, robin, in, the, wild, is, 14, years, the, average, lifespan, is, about, two, years, the, male, american, robin, as, with, many, thrushes, has, a, complex, and, almost, continuous, song, it, is, commonly, described, as, a, cheery, carol, made, up, of, discrete, units, often, repeated, and, spliced, together, into, a, string, with, brief, pauses, in, between, the, song, varies, regionally, and, its, style, varies, by, the, time, of, day, the, song, period, is, from, late, february, or, early, march, to, late, july, or, early, august, some, birds, particularly, in, the, east, sing, occasionally, into, september, or, later, they, are, often, among, the, first, songbirds, to, sing, as, dawn, rises, or, hours, before, and, last, as, evening, sets, in, it, usually, sings, from, a, high, perch, in, a, tree, the, song, of, the, san, lucas, subspecies, t, m, confinis, is, weaker, than, that, of, the, eastern, subspecies, t, m, migratorius, and, lacks, any, clear, notes, the, american, robin, also, sings, when, storms, approach, and, again, when, storms, have, passed, in, addition, to, its, song, the, species, has, a, number, of, calls, used, for, communicating, specific, information, such, as, when, a, ground, predator, approaches, and, when, a, nest, or, another, american, robin, is, being, directly, threatened, even, during, nesting, season, when, they, exhibit, mostly, competitive, and, territorial, behavior, they, may, still, band, together, to, drive, away, a, predator, the, american, robin, has, an, extensive, range, estimated, at, 16, 000, 000, km, 2, 6, 200, 000, sq, mi, and, a, large, population, of, about, 370, million, individuals, the, western, subspecies, t, m, propinquus, in, central, california, is, considered, to, be, expanding, its, range, as, is, likely, the, case, elsewhere, in, the, united, states, it, is, threatened, by, climate, change, and, severe, weather, but, the, population, trend, appears, to, be, stable, and, the, species, does, not, approach, the, vulnerable, species, thresholds, under, the, population, trend, criterion, 30, decline, over, ten, years, or, three, generations, and, therefore, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, evaluated, it, as, least, concern, at, one, point, the, bird, was, killed, for, its, meat, but, it, is, now, protected, throughout, its, range, in, the, united, states, by, the, migratory, bird, treaty, act, in, a, study, of, 209, psychology, students, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, eleanor, rosch, found, that, the, robin, was, in, the, students, minds, the, most, prototypical, example, of, a, bird, though, the, students, did, not, have, the, opportunity, to, specify, the, species, of, robin, robin, egg, blue, is, a, color, named, after, the, color, of, the, bird, s, eggs, the, american, robin, is, the, state, bird, of, connecticut, michigan, and, wisconsin, it, was, also, depicted, on, the, 1986, birds, of, canada, series, canadian, 2, note, this, note, was, subsequently, withdrawn, it, has, a, place, in, native, american, mythology, the, story, of, how, the, robin, got, its, red, breast, by, fanning, the, dying, flames, of, a, campfire, to, save, a, native, american, man, and, a, boy, is, similar, to, those, that, surround, the, european, robin, the, tlingit, people, of, northwestern, north, america, held, it, to, be, a, culture, hero, created, by, raven, to, please, the, people, with, its, song, the, peace, bridge, robins, were, a, family, of, american, robins, that, attracted, minor, publicity, in, the, mid, 1930s, for, their, prominent, nest, on, the, canadian, side, of, the, peace, bridge, connecting, buffalo, new, york, to, fort, erie, ontario, the, american, robin, is, considered, a, symbol, of, spring, a, well, known, example, is, a, poem, by, emily, dickinson, titled, i, dreaded, that, first, robin, so, among, other, 19th, century, poems, about, the, first, robin, of, spring, is, the, first, robin, by, william, henry, drummond, which, according, to, the, author, s, wife, is, based, on, a, quebec, superstition, that, whoever, sees, the, first, robin, of, spring, will, have, good, luck, the, association, has, continued, down, to, the, present, day, as, for, example, in, one, calvin, and, hobbes, cartoon, from, 1990, that, had, calvin, celebrating, his, inevitable, wealth, and, fame, after, seeing, the, first, robin, of, spring, the, harbinger, of, spring, sobriquet, is, borne, out, by, the, fact, that, american, robins, tend, to, follow, the, 37, f, 3, c, isotherm, north, in, spring, but, also, south, in, fall, american, popular, songs, featuring, this, bird, include, when, the, red, red, robin, comes, bob, bob, bobbin, along, written, by, harry, m, woods, although, the, comic, book, superhero, robin, was, inspired, by, an, n, c, wyeth, illustration, of, robin, hood, a, later, version, had, his, mother, nicknaming, him, robin, because, he, was, born, on, the, first, day, of, spring
