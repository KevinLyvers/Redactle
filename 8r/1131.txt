cauliflower, is, one, of, several, vegetables, cultivated, from, the, species, brassica, oleracea, in, the, genus, brassica, which, is, in, the, brassicaceae, or, mustard, family, an, annual, plant, that, reproduces, by, seed, the, cauliflower, head, is, composed, of, a, generally, white, inflorescence, meristem, cauliflower, heads, resemble, those, in, broccoli, which, differs, in, having, flower, buds, as, the, edible, portion, typically, only, the, head, is, eaten, the, edible, white, flesh, is, sometimes, called, curd, the, global, production, of, cauliflower, and, broccoli, in, 2020, was, over, 25, 5, million, tons, and, worth, 14, 1, billion, us, dollars, there, are, four, major, groups, of, cauliflower, cauliflowers, are, an, arrested, inflorescence, subspecies, of, b, oleracea, that, arose, around, 2, 500, years, ago, genomic, analysis, finds, initially, evolved, from, broccoli, with, three, mads, box, genes, playing, roles, in, the, formation, of, its, curd, nine, loci, and, candidate, genes, are, linked, with, morphological, and, biological, characters, there, are, hundreds, of, historic, and, current, commercial, varieties, used, around, the, world, a, comprehensive, list, of, about, 80, north, american, varieties, is, maintained, at, north, carolina, state, university, cauliflower, contains, several, non, nutrient, phytochemicals, common, in, the, cabbage, family, that, are, under, preliminary, research, for, their, potential, properties, including, isothiocyanates, and, glucosinolates, boiling, reduces, the, levels, of, cauliflower, glucosinolates, while, other, cooking, methods, such, as, steaming, microwaving, and, stir, frying, have, no, significant, effect, on, glucosinolate, levels, the, word, cauliflower, derives, from, the, italian, cavolfiore, meaning, cabbage, flower, the, ultimate, origin, of, the, name, is, from, the, latin, words, caulis, cabbage, and, fl, s, flower, cauliflower, is, the, result, of, selective, breeding, and, likely, arose, in, the, mediterranean, region, possibly, from, broccoli, pliny, the, elder, included, cyma, among, cultivated, plants, he, described, in, natural, history, ex, omnibus, brassicae, generibus, suavissima, est, cyma, of, all, the, varieties, of, cabbage, the, most, pleasant, tasted, is, cyma, pliny, s, description, likely, refers, to, the, flowering, heads, of, an, earlier, cultivated, variety, of, brassica, oleracea, in, the, middle, ages, early, forms, of, cauliflower, were, associated, with, the, island, of, cyprus, with, the, 12th, and, 13th, century, arab, botanists, ibn, al, awwam, and, ibn, al, baitar, claiming, its, origin, to, be, cyprus, this, association, continued, into, western, europe, where, cauliflowers, were, sometimes, known, as, cyprus, colewort, and, there, was, extensive, trade, in, western, europe, in, cauliflower, seeds, from, cyprus, under, the, french, lusignan, rulers, of, the, island, until, well, into, the, 16th, century, it, is, thought, to, have, been, introduced, into, italy, from, cyprus, or, the, east, coast, of, the, mediterranean, around, 1490, and, then, spread, to, other, european, countries, in, the, following, centuries, fran, ois, pierre, la, varenne, employed, chouxfleurs, in, le, cuisinier, fran, ois, they, were, introduced, to, france, from, genoa, in, the, 16th, century, and, are, featured, in, olivier, de, serres, th, tre, de, l, agriculture, 1600, as, cauli, fiori, as, the, italians, call, it, which, are, still, rather, rare, in, france, they, hold, an, honorable, place, in, the, garden, because, of, their, delicacy, but, they, did, not, commonly, appear, on, grand, tables, until, the, time, of, louis, xiv, it, was, introduced, to, india, in, 1822, by, the, british, in, 2020, global, production, of, cauliflowers, combined, for, production, reports, with, broccoli, was, 25, 5, million, tonnes, led, by, china, and, india, which, combined, had, 72, of, the, world, total, secondary, producers, having, 0, 4, 1, 3, million, tonnes, annually, were, the, united, states, spain, mexico, and, italy, cauliflower, is, relatively, difficult, to, grow, compared, to, cabbage, with, common, problems, such, as, an, underdeveloped, head, and, poor, curd, quality, because, the, weather, is, a, limiting, factor, for, producing, cauliflower, the, plant, grows, best, in, moderate, daytime, temperatures, 21, 29, c, 70, 85, f, with, plentiful, sun, and, moist, soil, conditions, high, in, organic, matter, and, sandy, soils, the, earliest, maturity, possible, for, cauliflower, is, 7, to, 12, weeks, from, transplanting, in, the, northern, hemisphere, fall, season, plantings, in, july, may, enable, harvesting, before, autumn, frost, long, periods, of, sun, exposure, in, hot, summer, weather, may, cause, cauliflower, heads, to, discolor, with, a, red, purple, hue, transplantable, cauliflowers, can, be, produced, in, containers, such, as, flats, hotbeds, or, fields, in, soil, that, is, loose, well, drained, and, fertile, field, seedlings, are, shallow, planted, 1, cm, 1, 2, in, and, thinned, by, ample, space, about, 12, plants, per, 30, cm, 1, ft, ideal, growing, temperatures, are, about, 18, c, 65, f, when, seedlings, are, 25, to, 35, days, old, applications, of, fertilizer, to, developing, seedlings, begin, when, leaves, appear, usually, with, a, starter, solution, weekly, transplanting, to, the, field, normally, begins, in, late, spring, and, may, continue, until, mid, summer, row, spacing, is, about, 38, 46, cm, 15, 18, in, rapid, vegetative, growth, after, transplanting, may, benefit, from, such, procedures, as, avoiding, spring, frosts, using, starter, solutions, high, in, phosphorus, irrigating, weekly, and, applying, fertilizer, the, most, important, disorders, affecting, cauliflower, quality, are, a, hollow, stem, stunted, head, growth, or, buttoning, ricing, browning, and, leaf, tip, burn, among, major, pests, affecting, cauliflower, are, aphids, root, maggots, cutworms, moths, and, flea, beetles, the, plant, is, susceptible, to, black, rot, black, leg, club, root, black, leaf, spot, and, downy, mildew, when, cauliflower, is, mature, heads, appear, clear, white, compact, and, 15, 20, cm, 6, 8, in, in, diameter, and, should, be, cooled, shortly, after, harvest, forced, air, cooling, to, remove, heat, from, the, field, during, hot, weather, may, be, needed, for, optimal, preservation, short, term, storage, is, possible, using, cool, high, humidity, storage, conditions, many, species, of, blowflies, including, calliphora, vomitoria, are, known, pollinators, of, cauliflower, cauliflower, heads, can, be, roasted, grilled, boiled, fried, steamed, pickled, or, eaten, raw, when, cooking, the, outer, leaves, and, thick, stalks, are, typically, removed, leaving, only, the, florets, the, edible, curd, or, head, the, leaves, are, also, edible, but, are, often, discarded, cauliflower, can, be, used, as, a, low, calorie, gluten, free, alternative, to, rice, and, flour, between, 2012, and, 2016, cauliflower, production, in, the, united, states, increased, by, 63, and, cauliflower, based, product, sales, increased, by, 71, between, 2017, and, 2018, cauliflower, rice, is, made, by, pulsing, cauliflower, florets, and, cooking, the, result, in, oil, cauliflower, pizza, crust, is, made, from, cauliflower, flour, and, is, popular, in, pizza, restaurants, mashed, cauliflower, is, a, low, carbohydrate, alternative, to, mashed, potatoes, raw, cauliflower, is, 92, water, 5, carbohydrates, 2, protein, and, contains, negligible, fat, see, table, a, 100, gram, 3, 1, 2, ounce, reference, amount, of, raw, cauliflower, provides, 104, kilojoules, 25, kilocalories, of, food, energy, and, has, a, high, content, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, vitamin, c, 58, dv, and, moderate, levels, of, several, b, vitamins, and, vitamin, k, 13, 15, dv, table, contents, of, dietary, minerals, are, low, 7, dv, or, less, cauliflower, has, been, noticed, by, mathematicians, for, its, distinct, fractal, dimension, calculated, to, be, roughly, 2, 8, one, of, the, fractal, properties, of, cauliflower, is, that, every, branch, or, module, is, similar, to, the, entire, cauliflower, another, quality, also, present, in, other, plant, species, is, that, the, angle, between, modules, as, they, become, more, distant, from, the, center, is, 360, degrees, divided, by, the, golden, ratio, the, fancied, resemblance, of, the, shape, of, a, boxer, s, ear, to, a, cauliflower, gave, rise, to, the, term, cauliflower, ear
