fringillinae, carduelinae, euphoniinae, the, true, finches, are, small, to, medium, sized, passerine, birds, in, the, family, fringillidae, finches, generally, have, stout, conical, bills, adapted, for, eating, seeds, and, nuts, and, often, have, colourful, plumage, they, occupy, a, great, range, of, habitats, where, they, are, usually, resident, and, do, not, migrate, they, have, a, worldwide, native, distribution, except, for, australia, and, the, polar, regions, the, family, fringillidae, contains, more, than, two, hundred, species, divided, into, fifty, genera, it, includes, the, canaries, siskins, redpolls, serins, grosbeaks, and, euphonias, as, well, as, the, morphologically, divergent, hawaiian, honeycreepers, many, birds, in, other, families, are, also, commonly, called, finches, these, groups, include, the, estrildid, finches, estrildidae, of, the, old, world, tropics, and, australia, some, members, of, the, old, world, bunting, family, emberizidae, and, the, new, world, sparrow, family, passerellidae, and, the, darwin, s, finches, of, the, galapagos, islands, now, considered, members, of, the, tanager, family, thraupidae, finches, and, canaries, were, used, in, the, uk, us, and, canada, in, the, coal, mining, industry, to, detect, carbon, monoxide, from, the, eighteenth, to, twentieth, century, this, practice, ceased, in, the, uk, in, 1986, the, name, fringillidae, for, the, finch, family, was, introduced, in, 1819, by, the, english, zoologist, william, elford, leach, in, a, guide, to, the, contents, of, the, british, museum, the, taxonomy, of, the, family, in, particular, the, cardueline, finches, has, a, long, and, complicated, history, the, study, of, the, relationship, between, the, taxa, has, been, confounded, by, the, recurrence, of, similar, morphologies, due, to, the, convergence, of, species, occupying, similar, niches, in, 1968, the, american, ornithologist, raymond, andrew, paynter, jr, wrote, limits, of, the, genera, and, relationships, among, the, species, are, less, understood, and, subject, to, more, controversy, in, the, carduelines, than, in, any, other, species, of, passerines, with, the, possible, exception, of, the, estrildines, beginning, around, 1990, a, series, of, phylogenetic, studies, based, on, mitochondrial, and, nuclear, dna, sequences, resulted, in, substantial, revisions, in, the, taxonomy, several, groups, of, birds, that, had, previously, been, assigned, to, other, families, were, found, to, be, related, to, the, finches, the, neotropical, euphonia, and, the, chlorophonia, were, formerly, placed, in, the, tanager, family, thraupidae, due, to, their, similar, appearance, but, analysis, of, mitochondrial, dna, sequences, revealed, that, both, genera, were, more, closely, related, to, the, finches, they, are, now, placed, in, a, separate, subfamily, euphoniinae, within, the, fringillidae, the, hawaiian, honeycreepers, were, at, one, time, placed, in, their, own, family, drepanididae, but, were, found, to, be, closely, related, to, the, carpodacus, rosefinches, and, are, now, placed, within, the, carduelinae, subfamily, the, three, largest, genera, carpodacus, carduelis, and, serinus, were, found, to, be, polyphyletic, each, was, split, into, monophyletic, genera, the, american, rosefinches, were, moved, from, carpodacus, to, haemorhous, carduelis, was, split, by, moving, the, greenfinches, to, chloris, and, a, large, clade, into, spinus, leaving, just, three, species, in, the, original, genus, thirty, seven, species, were, moved, from, serinus, to, crithagra, leaving, eight, species, in, the, original, genus, today, the, family, fringillidae, is, divided, into, three, subfamilies, the, fringillinae, containing, a, single, genus, with, the, chaffinches, the, carduelinae, containing, 183, species, divided, into, 49, genera, and, the, euphoniinae, containing, the, euphonia, and, the, chlorophonia, although, przewalski, s, rosefinch, urocynchramus, pylzowi, has, ten, primary, flight, feathers, rather, than, the, nine, primaries, of, other, finches, it, was, sometimes, classified, in, the, carduelinae, it, is, now, assigned, to, a, distinct, family, urocynchramidae, monotypic, as, to, genus, and, species, and, with, no, particularly, close, relatives, among, the, passeroidea, fringilla, chaffinches, chlorophonia, chlorophonias,

goldfinches, eurasian, siskin, and, tibetan, serin, fossil, remains, of, true, finches, are, rare, and, those, that, are, known, can, mostly, be, assigned, to, extant, genera, at, least, like, the, other, passeroidea, families, the, true, finches, seem, to, be, of, roughly, middle, miocene, origin, around, 20, to, 10, million, years, ago, ma, an, unidentifable, finch, fossil, from, the, messinian, age, around, 12, to, 7, 3, million, years, ago, ma, during, the, late, miocene, subepoch, has, been, found, at, polg, rdi, in, hungary, the, smallest, classical, true, finches, are, the, andean, siskin, spinus, spinescens, at, as, little, as, 9, 5, cm, 3, 8, in, and, the, lesser, goldfinch, spinus, psaltria, at, as, little, as, 8, g, 0, 28, oz, the, largest, species, is, probably, the, collared, grosbeak, mycerobas, affinis, at, up, to, 24, cm, 9, 4, in, and, 83, g, 2, 9, oz, although, larger, lengths, to, 25, 5, cm, 10, 0, in, in, the, pine, grosbeak, pinicola, enucleator, and, weights, to, 86, 1, g, 3, 04, oz, in, the, evening, grosbeak, hesperiphona, vespertina, have, been, recorded, in, species, which, are, slightly, smaller, on, average, they, typically, have, strong, stubby, beaks, which, in, some, species, can, be, quite, large, however, hawaiian, honeycreepers, are, famous, for, the, wide, range, of, bill, shapes, and, sizes, brought, about, by, adaptive, radiation, all, true, finches, have, 9, primary, remiges, and, 12, rectrices, the, basic, plumage, colour, is, brownish, sometimes, greenish, many, have, considerable, amounts, of, black, while, white, plumage, is, generally, absent, except, as, wing, bars, or, other, signalling, marks, bright, yellow, and, red, carotenoid, pigments, are, commonplace, in, this, family, and, thus, blue, structural, colours, are, rather, rare, as, the, yellow, pigments, turn, the, blue, color, into, green, many, but, by, no, means, all, true, finches, have, strong, sexual, dichromatism, the, females, typically, lacking, the, bright, carotenoid, markings, of, males, the, finches, have, a, near, global, distribution, being, found, across, the, americas, eurasia, and, africa, as, well, as, some, island, groups, such, as, the, hawaiian, islands, they, are, absent, from, australasia, antarctica, the, southern, pacific, and, the, islands, of, the, indian, ocean, although, some, european, species, have, been, widely, introduced, in, australia, and, new, zealand, finches, are, typically, inhabitants, of, well, wooded, areas, but, some, can, be, found, on, mountains, or, even, in, deserts, the, finches, are, primarily, granivorous, but, euphoniines, include, considerable, amounts, of, arthropods, and, berries, in, their, diet, and, hawaiian, honeycreepers, evolved, to, utilize, a, wide, range, of, food, sources, including, nectar, the, diet, of, fringillidae, nestlings, includes, a, varying, amount, of, small, arthropods, true, finches, have, a, bouncing, flight, like, most, small, passerines, alternating, bouts, of, flapping, with, gliding, on, closed, wings, most, sing, well, and, several, are, commonly, seen, cagebirds, foremost, among, these, is, the, domesticated, canary, serinus, canaria, domestica, the, nests, are, basket, shaped, and, usually, built, in, trees, more, rarely, in, bushes, between, rocks, or, on, similar, substrate, the, family, fringillidae, contains, 235, species, divided, into, 50, genera, and, three, subfamilies, the, subfamily, carduelinae, includes, 18, extinct, hawaiian, honeycreepers, and, the, extinct, bonin, grosbeak, see, list,
