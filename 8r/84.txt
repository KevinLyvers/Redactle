the, cerebral, cortex, also, known, as, the, cerebral, mantle, is, the, outer, layer, of, neural, tissue, of, the, cerebrum, of, the, brain, in, humans, and, other, mammals, it, is, the, largest, site, of, neural, integration, in, the, central, nervous, system, and, plays, a, key, role, in, attention, perception, awareness, thought, memory, language, and, consciousness, the, cerebral, cortex, is, the, part, of, the, brain, responsible, for, cognition, the, six, layered, neocortex, makes, up, approximately, 90, of, the, cortex, with, the, allocortex, making, up, the, remainder, the, cortex, is, divided, into, left, and, right, parts, by, the, longitudinal, fissure, which, separates, the, two, cerebral, hemispheres, that, are, joined, beneath, the, cortex, by, the, corpus, callosum, in, most, mammals, apart, from, small, mammals, that, have, small, brains, the, cerebral, cortex, is, folded, providing, a, greater, surface, area, in, the, confined, volume, of, the, cranium, apart, from, minimising, brain, and, cranial, volume, cortical, folding, is, crucial, for, the, brain, circuitry, and, its, functional, organisation, in, mammals, with, small, brains, there, is, no, folding, and, the, cortex, is, smooth, a, fold, or, ridge, in, the, cortex, is, termed, a, gyrus, plural, gyri, and, a, groove, is, termed, a, sulcus, plural, sulci, these, surface, convolutions, appear, during, fetal, development, and, continue, to, mature, after, birth, through, the, process, of, gyrification, in, the, human, brain, the, majority, of, the, cerebral, cortex, is, not, visible, from, the, outside, but, buried, in, the, sulci, the, major, sulci, and, gyri, mark, the, divisions, of, the, cerebrum, into, the, lobes, of, the, brain, the, four, major, lobes, are, the, frontal, parietal, occipital, and, temporal, lobes, other, lobes, are, the, limbic, lobe, and, the, insular, cortex, often, referred, to, as, the, insular, lobe, there, are, between, 14, and, 16, billion, neurons, in, the, human, cerebral, cortex, these, are, organised, into, horizontal, cortical, layers, and, radially, into, cortical, columns, and, minicolumns, cortical, areas, have, specific, functions, such, as, movement, in, the, motor, cortex, and, sight, in, the, visual, cortex, the, motor, cortex, is, primarily, located, in, the, precentral, gyrus, and, the, visual, cortex, is, located, in, the, occipital, lobe, the, cerebral, cortex, is, the, outer, covering, of, the, surfaces, of, the, cerebral, hemispheres, and, is, folded, into, peaks, called, gyri, and, grooves, called, sulci, in, the, human, brain, it, is, between, 2, and, 3, 4, mm, thick, and, makes, up, 40, of, the, brain, s, mass, 90, of, the, cerebral, cortex, is, the, six, layered, neocortex, whilst, the, other, 10, made, up, of, three, four, layered, allocortex, there, are, between, 14, and, 16, billion, neurons, in, the, cortex, and, these, are, organized, radially, in, cortical, columns, and, minicolumns, in, the, horizontally, organized, layers, of, the, cortex, the, neocortex, is, separable, into, different, regions, of, cortex, known, in, the, plural, as, cortices, and, include, the, motor, cortex, and, visual, cortex, about, two, thirds, of, the, cortical, surface, is, buried, in, the, sulci, and, the, insular, cortex, is, completely, hidden, the, cortex, is, thickest, over, the, top, of, a, gyrus, and, thinnest, at, the, bottom, of, a, sulcus, the, cerebral, cortex, is, folded, in, a, way, that, allows, a, large, surface, area, of, neural, tissue, to, fit, within, the, confines, of, the, neurocranium, when, unfolded, in, the, human, each, hemispheric, cortex, has, a, total, surface, area, of, about, 0, 12, square, metres, 1, 3, sq, ft, the, folding, is, inward, away, from, the, surface, of, the, brain, and, is, also, present, on, the, medial, surface, of, each, hemisphere, within, the, longitudinal, fissure, most, mammals, have, a, cerebral, cortex, that, is, convoluted, with, the, peaks, known, as, gyri, and, the, troughs, or, grooves, known, as, sulci, some, small, mammals, including, some, small, rodents, have, smooth, cerebral, surfaces, without, gyrification, the, larger, sulci, and, gyri, mark, the, divisions, of, the, cortex, of, the, cerebrum, into, the, lobes, of, the, brain, there, are, four, main, lobes, the, frontal, lobe, parietal, lobe, temporal, lobe, and, occipital, lobe, the, insular, cortex, is, often, included, as, the, insular, lobe, the, limbic, lobe, is, a, rim, of, cortex, on, the, medial, side, of, each, hemisphere, and, is, also, often, included, there, are, also, three, lobules, of, the, brain, described, the, paracentral, lobule, the, superior, parietal, lobule, and, the, inferior, parietal, lobule, for, species, of, mammals, larger, brains, in, absolute, terms, not, just, in, relation, to, body, size, tend, to, have, thicker, cortices, the, smallest, mammals, such, as, shrews, have, a, neocortical, thickness, of, about, 0, 5, mm, the, ones, with, the, largest, brains, such, as, humans, and, fin, whales, have, thicknesses, of, 2, 4, mm, there, is, an, approximately, logarithmic, relationship, between, brain, weight, and, cortical, thickness, magnetic, resonance, imaging, of, the, brain, mri, makes, it, possible, to, get, a, measure, for, the, thickness, of, the, human, cerebral, cortex, and, relate, it, to, other, measures, the, thickness, of, different, cortical, areas, varies, but, in, general, sensory, cortex, is, thinner, than, motor, cortex, one, study, has, found, some, positive, association, between, the, cortical, thickness, and, intelligence, another, study, has, found, that, the, somatosensory, cortex, is, thicker, in, migraine, patients, though, it, is, not, known, if, this, is, the, result, of, migraine, attacks, the, cause, of, them, or, if, both, are, the, result, of, a, shared, cause, a, later, study, using, a, larger, patient, population, reports, no, change, in, the, cortical, thickness, in, patients, with, migraine, a, genetic, disorder, of, the, cerebral, cortex, whereby, decreased, folding, in, certain, areas, results, in, a, microgyrus, where, there, are, four, layers, instead, of, six, is, in, some, instances, seen, to, be, related, to, dyslexia, the, neocortex, is, formed, of, six, layers, numbered, i, to, vi, from, the, outermost, layer, i, near, to, the, pia, mater, to, the, innermost, layer, vi, near, to, the, underlying, white, matter, each, cortical, layer, has, a, characteristic, distribution, of, different, neurons, and, their, connections, with, other, cortical, and, subcortical, regions, there, are, direct, connections, between, different, cortical, areas, and, indirect, connections, via, the, thalamus, one, of, the, clearest, examples, of, cortical, layering, is, the, line, of, gennari, in, the, primary, visual, cortex, this, is, a, band, of, whiter, tissue, that, can, be, observed, with, the, naked, eye, in, the, calcarine, sulcus, of, the, occipital, lobe, the, line, of, gennari, is, composed, of, axons, bringing, visual, information, from, the, thalamus, into, layer, iv, of, the, visual, cortex, staining, cross, sections, of, the, cortex, to, reveal, the, position, of, neuronal, cell, bodies, and, the, intracortical, axon, tracts, allowed, neuroanatomists, in, the, early, 20th, century, to, produce, a, detailed, description, of, the, laminar, structure, of, the, cortex, in, different, species, the, work, of, korbinian, brodmann, 1909, established, that, the, mammalian, neocortex, is, consistently, divided, into, six, layers, layer, i, is, the, molecular, layer, of, cerebral, cortex, molecular, layer, and, contains, few, scattered, neurons, including, gabaergic, rosehip, neurons, layer, i, consists, largely, of, extensions, of, apical, dendritic, tufts, of, pyramidal, neurons, and, horizontally, oriented, axons, as, well, as, glial, cells, during, development, cajal, retzius, cells, and, subpial, granular, layer, cells, are, present, in, this, layer, also, some, spiny, stellate, cells, can, be, found, here, inputs, to, the, apical, tufts, are, thought, to, be, crucial, for, the, feedback, interactions, in, the, cerebral, cortex, involved, in, associative, learning, and, attention, while, it, was, once, thought, that, the, input, to, layer, i, came, from, the, cortex, itself, it, is, now, realized, that, layer, i, across, the, cerebral, cortex, mantle, receives, substantial, input, from, matrix, or, m, type, thalamus, cells, in, contrast, to, core, or, c, type, that, go, to, layer, iv, layer, ii, the, external, granular, layer, contains, small, pyramidal, neurons, and, numerous, stellate, neurons, layer, iii, the, external, pyramidal, layer, contains, predominantly, small, and, medium, size, pyramidal, neurons, as, well, as, non, pyramidal, neurons, with, vertically, oriented, intracortical, axons, layers, i, through, iii, are, the, main, target, of, interhemispheric, corticocortical, afferents, and, layer, iii, is, the, principal, source, of, corticocortical, efferents, layer, iv, the, internal, granular, layer, contains, different, types, of, stellate, and, pyramidal, cells, and, is, the, main, target, of, thalamocortical, afferents, from, thalamus, type, c, neurons, core, type, as, well, as, intra, hemispheric, corticocortical, afferents, the, layers, above, layer, iv, are, also, referred, to, as, supragranular, layers, layers, i, iii, whereas, the, layers, below, are, referred, to, as, infragranular, layers, layers, v, and, vi, african, elephants, cetaceans, and, hippopotamus, do, not, have, a, layer, iv, with, axons, which, would, terminate, there, going, instead, to, the, inner, part, of, layer, iii, layer, v, the, internal, pyramidal, layer, contains, large, pyramidal, neurons, axons, from, these, leave, the, cortex, and, connect, with, subcortical, structures, including, the, basal, ganglia, in, the, primary, motor, cortex, of, the, frontal, lobe, layer, v, contains, giant, pyramidal, cells, called, betz, cells, whose, axons, travel, through, the, internal, capsule, the, brain, stem, and, the, spinal, cord, forming, the, corticospinal, tract, which, is, the, main, pathway, for, voluntary, motor, control, layer, vi, the, polymorphic, layer, or, multiform, layer, contains, few, large, pyramidal, neurons, and, many, small, spindle, like, pyramidal, and, multiform, neurons, layer, vi, sends, efferent, fibers, to, the, thalamus, establishing, a, very, precise, reciprocal, interconnection, between, the, cortex, and, the, thalamus, that, is, layer, vi, neurons, from, one, cortical, column, connect, with, thalamus, neurons, that, provide, input, to, the, same, cortical, column, these, connections, are, both, excitatory, and, inhibitory, neurons, send, excitatory, fibers, to, neurons, in, the, thalamus, and, also, send, collaterals, to, the, thalamic, reticular, nucleus, that, inhibit, these, same, thalamus, neurons, or, ones, adjacent, to, them, one, theory, is, that, because, the, inhibitory, output, is, reduced, by, cholinergic, input, to, the, cerebral, cortex, this, provides, the, brainstem, with, adjustable, gain, control, for, the, relay, of, lemniscal, inputs, the, cortical, layers, are, not, simply, stacked, one, over, the, other, there, exist, characteristic, connections, between, different, layers, and, neuronal, types, which, span, all, the, thickness, of, the, cortex, these, cortical, microcircuits, are, grouped, into, cortical, columns, and, minicolumns, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, minicolumns, are, the, basic, functional, units, of, the, cortex, in, 1957, vernon, mountcastle, showed, that, the, functional, properties, of, the, cortex, change, abruptly, between, laterally, adjacent, points, however, they, are, continuous, in, the, direction, perpendicular, to, the, surface, later, works, have, provided, evidence, of, the, presence, of, functionally, distinct, cortical, columns, in, the, visual, cortex, hubel, and, wiesel, 1959, auditory, cortex, and, associative, cortex, cortical, areas, that, lack, a, layer, iv, are, called, agranular, cortical, areas, that, have, only, a, rudimentary, layer, iv, are, called, dysgranular, information, processing, within, each, layer, is, determined, by, different, temporal, dynamics, with, that, in, layers, ii, iii, having, a, slow, 2, hz, oscillation, while, that, in, layer, v, has, a, fast, 10, 15, hz, oscillation, based, on, the, differences, in, laminar, organization, the, cerebral, cortex, can, be, classified, into, two, types, the, large, area, of, neocortex, which, has, six, cell, layers, and, the, much, smaller, area, of, allocortex, that, has, three, or, four, layers, there, is, a, transitional, area, between, the, neocortex, and, the, allocortex, called, the, paralimbic, cortex, where, layers, 2, 3, and, 4, are, merged, this, area, incorporates, the, proisocortex, of, the, neocortex, and, the, periallocortex, of, the, allocortex, in, addition, the, cerebral, cortex, may, be, classified, into, four, lobes, the, frontal, lobe, temporal, lobe, the, parietal, lobe, and, the, occipital, lobe, named, from, their, overlying, bones, of, the, skull, blood, supply, to, the, cerebral, cortex, is, part, of, the, cerebral, circulation, cerebral, arteries, supply, the, blood, that, perfuses, the, cerebrum, this, arterial, blood, carries, oxygen, glucose, and, other, nutrients, to, the, cortex, cerebral, veins, drain, the, deoxygenated, blood, and, metabolic, wastes, including, carbon, dioxide, back, to, the, heart, the, main, arteries, supplying, the, cortex, are, the, anterior, cerebral, artery, the, middle, cerebral, artery, and, the, posterior, cerebral, artery, the, anterior, cerebral, artery, supplies, the, anterior, portions, of, the, brain, including, most, of, the, frontal, lobe, the, middle, cerebral, artery, supplies, the, parietal, lobes, temporal, lobes, and, parts, of, the, occipital, lobes, the, middle, cerebral, artery, splits, into, two, branches, to, supply, the, left, and, right, hemisphere, where, they, branch, further, the, posterior, cerebral, artery, supplies, the, occipital, lobes, the, circle, of, willis, is, the, main, blood, system, that, deals, with, blood, supply, in, the, cerebrum, and, cerebral, cortex, the, prenatal, development, of, the, cerebral, cortex, is, a, complex, and, finely, tuned, process, called, corticogenesis, influenced, by, the, interplay, between, genes, and, the, environment, the, cerebral, cortex, develops, from, the, most, anterior, part, the, forebrain, region, of, the, neural, tube, the, neural, plate, folds, and, closes, to, form, the, neural, tube, from, the, cavity, inside, the, neural, tube, develops, the, ventricular, system, and, from, the, neuroepithelial, cells, of, its, walls, the, neurons, and, glia, of, the, nervous, system, the, most, anterior, front, or, cranial, part, of, the, neural, plate, the, prosencephalon, which, is, evident, before, neurulation, begins, gives, rise, to, the, cerebral, hemispheres, and, later, cortex, cortical, neurons, are, generated, within, the, ventricular, zone, next, to, the, ventricles, at, first, this, zone, contains, neural, stem, cells, that, transition, to, radial, glial, cells, progenitor, cells, which, divide, to, produce, glial, cells, and, neurons, the, cerebral, cortex, is, composed, of, a, heterogenous, population, of, cells, that, give, rise, to, different, cell, types, the, majority, of, these, cells, are, derived, from, radial, glia, migration, that, form, the, different, cell, types, of, the, neocortex, and, it, is, a, period, associated, with, an, increase, in, neurogenesis, similarly, the, process, of, neurogenesis, regulates, lamination, to, form, the, different, layers, of, the, cortex, during, this, process, there, is, an, increase, in, the, restriction, of, cell, fate, that, begins, with, earlier, progenitors, giving, rise, to, any, cell, type, in, the, cortex, and, later, progenitors, giving, rise, only, to, neurons, of, superficial, layers, this, differential, cell, fate, creates, an, inside, out, topography, in, the, cortex, with, younger, neurons, in, superficial, layers, and, older, neurons, in, deeper, layers, in, addition, laminar, neurons, are, stopped, in, s, or, g2, phase, in, order, to, give, a, fine, distinction, between, the, different, cortical, layers, laminar, differentiation, is, not, fully, complete, until, after, birth, since, during, development, laminar, neurons, are, still, sensitive, to, extrinsic, signals, and, environmental, cues, although, the, majority, of, the, cells, that, compose, the, cortex, are, derived, locally, from, radial, glia, there, is, a, subset, population, of, neurons, that, migrate, from, other, regions, radial, glia, give, rise, to, neurons, that, are, pyramidal, in, shape, and, use, glutamate, as, a, neurotransmitter, however, these, migrating, cells, contribute, neurons, that, are, stellate, shaped, and, use, gaba, as, their, main, neurotransmitter, these, gabaergic, neurons, are, generated, by, progenitor, cells, in, the, medial, ganglionic, eminence, mge, that, migrate, tangentially, to, the, cortex, via, the, subventricular, zone, this, migration, of, gabaergic, neurons, is, particularly, important, since, gaba, receptors, are, excitatory, during, development, this, excitation, is, primarily, driven, by, the, flux, of, chloride, ions, through, the, gaba, receptor, however, in, adults, chloride, concentrations, shift, causing, an, inward, flux, of, chloride, that, hyperpolarizes, postsynaptic, neurons, the, glial, fibers, produced, in, the, first, divisions, of, the, progenitor, cells, are, radially, oriented, spanning, the, thickness, of, the, cortex, from, the, ventricular, zone, to, the, outer, pial, surface, and, provide, scaffolding, for, the, migration, of, neurons, outwards, from, the, ventricular, zone, at, birth, there, are, very, few, dendrites, present, on, the, cortical, neuron, s, cell, body, and, the, axon, is, undeveloped, during, the, first, year, of, life, the, dendrites, become, dramatically, increased, in, number, such, that, they, can, accommodate, up, to, a, hundred, thousand, synaptic, connections, with, other, neurons, the, axon, can, develop, to, extend, a, long, way, from, the, cell, body, the, first, divisions, of, the, progenitor, cells, are, symmetric, which, duplicates, the, total, number, of, progenitor, cells, at, each, mitotic, cycle, then, some, progenitor, cells, begin, to, divide, asymmetrically, producing, one, postmitotic, cell, that, migrates, along, the, radial, glial, fibers, leaving, the, ventricular, zone, and, one, progenitor, cell, which, continues, to, divide, until, the, end, of, development, when, it, differentiates, into, a, glial, cell, or, an, ependymal, cell, as, the, g1, phase, of, mitosis, is, elongated, in, what, is, seen, as, selective, cell, cycle, lengthening, the, newly, born, neurons, migrate, to, more, superficial, layers, of, the, cortex, the, migrating, daughter, cells, become, the, pyramidal, cells, of, the, cerebral, cortex, the, development, process, is, time, ordered, and, regulated, by, hundreds, of, genes, and, epigenetic, regulatory, mechanisms, the, layered, structure, of, the, mature, cerebral, cortex, is, formed, during, development, the, first, pyramidal, neurons, generated, migrate, out, of, the, ventricular, zone, and, subventricular, zone, together, with, reelin, producing, cajal, retzius, neurons, from, the, preplate, next, a, cohort, of, neurons, migrating, into, the, middle, of, the, preplate, divides, this, transient, layer, into, the, superficial, marginal, zone, which, will, become, layer, i, of, the, mature, neocortex, and, the, subplate, forming, a, middle, layer, called, the, cortical, plate, these, cells, will, form, the, deep, layers, of, the, mature, cortex, layers, five, and, six, later, born, neurons, migrate, radially, into, the, cortical, plate, past, the, deep, layer, neurons, and, become, the, upper, layers, two, to, four, thus, the, layers, of, the, cortex, are, created, in, an, inside, out, order, the, only, exception, to, this, inside, out, sequence, of, neurogenesis, occurs, in, the, layer, i, of, primates, in, which, in, contrast, to, rodents, neurogenesis, continues, throughout, the, entire, period, of, corticogenesis, the, map, of, functional, cortical, areas, which, include, primary, motor, and, visual, cortex, originates, from, a, protomap, which, is, regulated, by, molecular, signals, such, as, fibroblast, growth, factor, fgf8, early, in, embryonic, development, these, signals, regulate, the, size, shape, and, position, of, cortical, areas, on, the, surface, of, the, cortical, primordium, in, part, by, regulating, gradients, of, transcription, factor, expression, through, a, process, called, cortical, patterning, examples, of, such, transcription, factors, include, the, genes, emx2, and, pax6, together, both, transcription, factors, form, an, opposing, gradient, of, expression, pax6, is, highly, expressed, at, the, rostral, lateral, pole, while, emx2, is, highly, expressed, in, the, caudomedial, pole, the, establishment, of, this, gradient, is, important, for, proper, development, for, example, mutations, in, pax6, can, cause, expression, levels, of, emx2, to, expand, out, of, its, normal, expression, domain, which, would, ultimately, lead, to, an, expansion, of, the, areas, normally, derived, from, the, caudal, medial, cortex, such, as, the, visual, cortex, on, the, contrary, if, mutations, in, emx2, occur, it, can, cause, the, pax6, expressing, domain, to, expand, and, result, in, the, frontal, and, motor, cortical, regions, enlarging, therefore, researchers, believe, that, similar, gradients, and, signaling, centers, next, to, the, cortex, could, contribute, to, the, regional, expression, of, these, transcription, factors, two, very, well, studied, patterning, signals, for, the, cortex, include, fgf, and, retinoic, acid, if, fgfs, are, misexpressed, in, different, areas, of, the, developing, cortex, cortical, patterning, is, disrupted, specifically, when, fgf8, is, increased, in, the, anterior, pole, emx2, is, downregulated, and, a, caudal, shift, in, the, cortical, region, occurs, this, ultimately, causes, an, expansion, of, the, rostral, regions, therefore, fgf8, and, other, fgfs, play, a, role, in, the, regulation, of, expression, of, emx2, and, pax6, and, represent, how, the, cerebral, cortex, can, become, specialized, for, different, functions, rapid, expansion, of, the, cortical, surface, area, is, regulated, by, the, amount, of, self, renewal, of, radial, glial, cells, and, is, partly, regulated, by, fgf, and, notch, genes, during, the, period, of, cortical, neurogenesis, and, layer, formation, many, higher, mammals, begin, the, process, of, gyrification, which, generates, the, characteristic, folds, of, the, cerebral, cortex, gyrification, is, regulated, by, a, dna, associated, protein, trnp1, and, by, fgf, and, shh, signaling, of, all, the, different, brain, regions, the, cerebral, cortex, shows, the, largest, evolutionary, variation, and, has, evolved, most, recently, in, contrast, to, the, highly, conserved, circuitry, of, the, medulla, oblongata, for, example, which, serves, critical, functions, such, as, regulation, of, heart, and, respiration, rates, many, areas, of, the, cerebral, cortex, are, not, strictly, necessary, for, survival, thus, the, evolution, of, the, cerebral, cortex, has, seen, the, advent, and, modification, of, new, functional, areas, particularly, association, areas, that, do, not, directly, receive, input, from, outside, the, cortex, a, key, theory, of, cortical, evolution, is, embodied, in, the, radial, unit, hypothesis, and, related, protomap, hypothesis, first, proposed, by, rakic, this, theory, states, that, new, cortical, areas, are, formed, by, the, addition, of, new, radial, units, which, is, accomplished, at, the, stem, cell, level, the, protomap, hypothesis, states, that, the, cellular, and, molecular, identity, and, characteristics, of, neurons, in, each, cortical, area, are, specified, by, cortical, stem, cells, known, as, radial, glial, cells, in, a, primordial, map, this, map, is, controlled, by, secreted, signaling, proteins, and, downstream, transcription, factors, the, cerebral, cortex, is, connected, to, various, subcortical, structures, such, as, the, thalamus, and, the, basal, ganglia, sending, information, to, them, along, efferent, connections, and, receiving, information, from, them, via, afferent, connections, most, sensory, information, is, routed, to, the, cerebral, cortex, via, the, thalamus, olfactory, information, however, passes, through, the, olfactory, bulb, to, the, olfactory, cortex, piriform, cortex, the, majority, of, connections, are, from, one, area, of, the, cortex, to, another, rather, than, from, subcortical, areas, braitenberg, and, sch, z, 1998, claim, that, in, primary, sensory, areas, at, the, cortical, level, where, the, input, fibers, terminate, up, to, 20, of, the, synapses, are, supplied, by, extracortical, afferents, but, that, in, other, areas, and, other, layers, the, percentage, is, likely, to, be, much, lower, the, whole, of, the, cerebral, cortex, was, divided, into, 52, different, areas, in, an, early, presentation, by, korbinian, brodmann, these, areas, known, as, brodmann, areas, are, based, on, their, cytoarchitecture, but, also, relate, to, various, functions, an, example, is, brodmann, area, 17, which, is, the, primary, visual, cortex, in, more, general, terms, the, cortex, is, typically, described, as, comprising, three, parts, sensory, motor, and, association, areas, the, sensory, areas, are, the, cortical, areas, that, receive, and, process, information, from, the, senses, parts, of, the, cortex, that, receive, sensory, inputs, from, the, thalamus, are, called, primary, sensory, areas, the, senses, of, vision, hearing, and, touch, are, served, by, the, primary, visual, cortex, primary, auditory, cortex, and, primary, somatosensory, cortex, respectively, in, general, the, two, hemispheres, receive, information, from, the, opposite, contralateral, side, of, the, body, for, example, the, right, primary, somatosensory, cortex, receives, information, from, the, left, limbs, and, the, right, visual, cortex, receives, information, from, the, left, visual, field, the, organization, of, sensory, maps, in, the, cortex, reflects, that, of, the, corresponding, sensing, organ, in, what, is, known, as, a, topographic, map, neighboring, points, in, the, primary, visual, cortex, for, example, correspond, to, neighboring, points, in, the, retina, this, topographic, map, is, called, a, retinotopic, map, in, the, same, way, there, exists, a, tonotopic, map, in, the, primary, auditory, cortex, and, a, somatotopic, map, in, the, primary, sensory, cortex, this, last, topographic, map, of, the, body, onto, the, posterior, central, gyrus, has, been, illustrated, as, a, deformed, human, representation, the, somatosensory, homunculus, where, the, size, of, different, body, parts, reflects, the, relative, density, of, their, innervation, areas, with, much, sensory, innervation, such, as, the, fingertips, and, the, lips, require, more, cortical, area, to, process, finer, sensation, the, motor, areas, are, located, in, both, hemispheres, of, the, cortex, the, motor, areas, are, very, closely, related, to, the, control, of, voluntary, movements, especially, fine, fragmented, movements, performed, by, the, hand, the, right, half, of, the, motor, area, controls, the, left, side, of, the, body, and, vice, versa, two, areas, of, the, cortex, are, commonly, referred, to, as, motor, in, addition, motor, functions, have, been, described, for, just, underneath, the, cerebral, cortex, are, interconnected, subcortical, masses, of, grey, matter, called, basal, ganglia, or, nuclei, the, basal, ganglia, receive, input, from, the, substantia, nigra, of, the, midbrain, and, motor, areas, of, the, cerebral, cortex, and, send, signals, back, to, both, of, these, locations, they, are, involved, in, motor, control, they, are, found, lateral, to, the, thalamus, the, main, components, of, the, basal, ganglia, are, the, caudate, nucleus, the, putamen, the, globus, pallidus, the, substantia, nigra, the, nucleus, accumbens, and, the, subthalamic, nucleus, the, putamen, and, globus, pallidus, are, also, collectively, known, as, the, lentiform, nucleus, because, together, they, form, a, lens, shaped, body, the, putamen, and, caudate, nucleus, are, also, collectively, called, the, corpus, striatum, after, their, striped, appearance, the, association, areas, are, the, parts, of, the, cerebral, cortex, that, do, not, belong, to, the, primary, regions, they, function, to, produce, a, meaningful, perceptual, experience, of, the, world, enable, us, to, interact, effectively, and, support, abstract, thinking, and, language, the, parietal, temporal, and, occipital, lobes, all, located, in, the, posterior, part, of, the, cortex, integrate, sensory, information, and, information, stored, in, memory, the, frontal, lobe, or, prefrontal, association, complex, is, involved, in, planning, actions, and, movement, as, well, as, abstract, thought, globally, the, association, areas, are, organized, as, distributed, networks, each, network, connects, areas, distributed, across, widely, spaced, regions, of, the, cortex, distinct, networks, are, positioned, adjacent, to, one, another, yielding, a, complex, series, of, interwoven, networks, the, specific, organization, of, the, association, networks, is, debated, with, evidence, for, interactions, hierarchical, relationships, and, competition, between, networks, in, humans, association, networks, are, particularly, important, to, language, function, in, the, past, it, was, theorized, that, language, abilities, are, localized, in, broca, s, area, in, areas, of, the, left, inferior, frontal, gyrus, ba44, and, ba45, for, language, expression, and, in, wernicke, s, area, ba22, for, language, reception, however, the, processes, of, language, expression, and, reception, have, been, shown, to, occur, in, areas, other, than, just, those, structures, around, the, lateral, sulcus, including, the, frontal, lobe, basal, ganglia, cerebellum, and, pons, neurodegenerative, diseases, such, as, alzheimer, s, disease, show, as, a, marker, an, atrophy, of, the, grey, matter, of, the, cerebral, cortex, other, diseases, of, the, central, nervous, system, include, neurological, disorders, such, as, epilepsy, movement, disorders, and, different, types, of, aphasia, difficulties, in, speech, expression, or, comprehension, brain, damage, from, disease, or, trauma, can, involve, damage, to, a, specific, lobe, such, as, in, frontal, lobe, disorder, and, associated, functions, will, be, affected, the, blood, brain, barrier, that, serves, to, protect, the, brain, from, infection, can, become, compromised, allowing, entry, to, pathogens, the, developing, fetus, is, susceptible, to, a, range, of, environmental, factors, that, can, cause, birth, defects, and, problems, in, later, development, maternal, alcohol, consumption, for, example, can, cause, fetal, alcohol, spectrum, disorder, other, factors, that, can, cause, neurodevelopment, disorders, are, toxicants, such, as, drugs, and, exposure, to, radiation, as, from, x, rays, infections, can, also, affect, the, development, of, the, cortex, a, viral, infection, is, one, of, the, causes, of, lissencephaly, which, results, in, a, smooth, cortex, without, gyrification, a, type, of, electrocorticography, called, cortical, stimulation, mapping, is, an, invasive, procedure, that, involves, placing, electrodes, directly, onto, the, exposed, brain, in, order, to, localise, the, functions, of, specific, areas, of, the, cortex, it, is, used, in, clinical, and, therapeutic, applications, including, pre, surgical, mapping, there, are, a, number, of, genetic, mutations, that, can, cause, a, wide, range, of, genetic, disorders, of, the, cerebral, cortex, including, microcephaly, schizencephaly, and, types, of, lissencephaly, chromosome, abnormalities, can, also, result, causing, a, number, of, neurodevelopmental, disorders, such, as, fragile, x, syndrome, and, rett, syndrome, mcph1, codes, for, microcephalin, and, disorders, in, this, and, in, aspm, are, associated, with, microcephaly, mutations, in, the, gene, nbs1, that, codes, for, nibrin, can, cause, nijmegen, breakage, syndrome, characterised, by, microcephaly, mutations, in, emx2, and, col4a1, are, associated, with, schizencephaly, a, condition, marked, by, the, absence, of, large, parts, of, the, cerebral, hemispheres, in, 1909, korbinian, brodmann, distinguished, 52, different, regions, of, the, cerebral, cortex, based, on, their, cytoarchitecture, these, are, known, as, brodmann, areas, rafael, lorente, de, n, a, student, of, santiago, ramon, y, cajal, identified, more, than, 40, different, types, of, cortical, neurons, based, on, the, distribution, of, their, dendrites, and, axons, the, cerebral, cortex, is, derived, from, the, pallium, a, layered, structure, found, in, the, forebrain, of, all, vertebrates, the, basic, form, of, the, pallium, is, a, cylindrical, layer, enclosing, fluid, filled, ventricles, around, the, circumference, of, the, cylinder, are, four, zones, the, dorsal, pallium, medial, pallium, ventral, pallium, and, lateral, pallium, which, are, thought, to, be, homologous, to, the, neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and, olfactory, cortex, respectively, in, avian, brains, evidence, suggests, the, avian, pallium, s, neuroarchitecture, to, be, reminiscent, of, the, mammalian, cerebral, cortex, the, avian, pallium, has, also, been, suggested, to, be, an, equivalent, neural, basis, for, consciousness, until, recently, no, counterpart, to, the, cerebral, cortex, had, been, recognized, in, invertebrates, however, a, study, published, in, the, journal, cell, in, 2010, based, on, gene, expression, profiles, reported, strong, affinities, between, the, cerebral, cortex, and, the, mushroom, bodies, of, the, ragworm, platynereis, dumerilii, mushroom, bodies, are, structures, in, the, brains, of, many, types, of, worms, and, arthropods, that, are, known, to, play, important, roles, in, learning, and, memory, the, genetic, evidence, indicates, a, common, evolutionary, origin, and, therefore, indicates, that, the, origins, of, the, earliest, precursors, of, the, cerebral, cortex, date, back, to, the, precambrian, era
