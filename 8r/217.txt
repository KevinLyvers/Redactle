reproduction, or, procreation, or, breeding, is, the, biological, process, by, which, new, individual, organisms, offspring, are, produced, from, their, parent, or, parents, there, are, two, forms, of, reproduction, asexual, and, sexual, in, asexual, reproduction, an, organism, can, reproduce, without, the, involvement, of, another, organism, asexual, reproduction, is, not, limited, to, single, celled, organisms, the, cloning, of, an, organism, is, a, form, of, asexual, reproduction, by, asexual, reproduction, an, organism, creates, a, genetically, similar, or, identical, copy, of, itself, the, evolution, of, sexual, reproduction, is, a, major, puzzle, for, biologists, the, two, fold, cost, of, sexual, reproduction, is, that, only, 50, of, organisms, reproduce, and, organisms, only, pass, on, 50, of, their, genes, sexual, reproduction, typically, requires, the, sexual, interaction, of, two, specialized, reproductive, cells, called, gametes, which, contain, half, the, number, of, chromosomes, of, normal, cells, and, are, created, by, meiosis, with, typically, a, male, fertilizing, a, female, of, the, same, species, to, create, a, fertilized, zygote, this, produces, offspring, organisms, whose, genetic, characteristics, are, derived, from, those, of, the, two, parental, organisms, asexual, reproduction, is, a, process, by, which, organisms, create, genetically, similar, or, identical, copies, of, themselves, without, the, contribution, of, genetic, material, from, another, organism, bacteria, divide, asexually, via, binary, fission, viruses, take, control, of, host, cells, to, produce, more, viruses, hydras, invertebrates, of, the, order, hydroidea, and, yeasts, are, able, to, reproduce, by, budding, these, organisms, often, do, not, possess, different, sexes, and, they, are, capable, of, splitting, themselves, into, two, or, more, copies, of, themselves, most, plants, have, the, ability, to, reproduce, asexually, and, the, ant, species, mycocepurus, smithii, is, thought, to, reproduce, entirely, by, asexual, means, some, species, that, are, capable, of, reproducing, asexually, like, hydra, yeast, see, mating, of, yeasts, and, jellyfish, may, also, reproduce, sexually, for, instance, most, plants, are, capable, of, vegetative, reproduction, reproduction, without, seeds, or, spores, but, can, also, reproduce, sexually, likewise, bacteria, may, exchange, genetic, information, by, conjugation, other, ways, of, asexual, reproduction, include, parthenogenesis, fragmentation, and, spore, formation, that, involves, only, mitosis, parthenogenesis, is, the, growth, and, development, of, embryo, or, seed, without, fertilization, parthenogenesis, occurs, naturally, in, some, species, including, lower, plants, where, it, is, called, apomixis, invertebrates, e, g, water, fleas, aphids, some, bees, and, parasitic, wasps, and, vertebrates, e, g, some, reptiles, some, fish, and, very, rarely, domestic, birds, sexual, reproduction, is, a, biological, process, that, creates, a, new, organism, by, combining, the, genetic, material, of, two, organisms, in, a, process, that, starts, with, meiosis, a, specialized, type, of, cell, division, each, of, two, parent, organisms, contributes, half, of, the, offspring, s, genetic, makeup, by, creating, haploid, gametes, most, organisms, form, two, different, types, of, gametes, in, these, anisogamous, species, the, two, sexes, are, referred, to, as, male, producing, sperm, or, microspores, and, female, producing, ova, or, megaspores, in, isogamous, species, the, gametes, are, similar, or, identical, in, form, isogametes, but, may, have, separable, properties, and, then, may, be, given, other, different, names, see, isogamy, because, both, gametes, look, alike, they, generally, cannot, be, classified, as, male, or, female, for, example, in, the, green, alga, chlamydomonas, reinhardtii, there, are, so, called, plus, and, minus, gametes, a, few, types, of, organisms, such, as, many, fungi, and, the, ciliate, paramecium, aurelia, have, more, than, two, sexes, called, mating, types, most, animals, including, humans, and, plants, reproduce, sexually, sexually, reproducing, organisms, have, different, sets, of, genes, for, every, trait, called, alleles, offspring, inherit, one, allele, for, each, trait, from, each, parent, thus, offspring, have, a, combination, of, the, parents, genes, it, is, believed, that, the, masking, of, deleterious, alleles, favors, the, evolution, of, a, dominant, diploid, phase, in, organisms, that, alternate, between, haploid, and, diploid, phases, where, recombination, occurs, freely, bryophytes, reproduce, sexually, but, the, larger, and, commonly, seen, organisms, are, haploid, and, produce, gametes, the, gametes, fuse, to, form, a, zygote, which, develops, into, a, sporangium, which, in, turn, produces, haploid, spores, the, diploid, stage, is, relatively, small, and, short, lived, compared, to, the, haploid, stage, i, e, haploid, dominance, the, advantage, of, diploidy, heterosis, only, exists, in, the, diploid, life, generation, bryophytes, retain, sexual, reproduction, despite, the, fact, that, the, haploid, stage, does, not, benefit, from, heterosis, this, may, be, an, indication, that, the, sexual, reproduction, has, advantages, other, than, heterosis, such, as, genetic, recombination, between, members, of, the, species, allowing, the, expression, of, a, wider, range, of, traits, and, thus, making, the, population, more, able, to, survive, environmental, variation, allogamy, is, the, fertilization, of, flowers, through, cross, pollination, this, occurs, when, a, flower, s, ovum, is, fertilized, by, spermatozoa, from, the, pollen, of, a, different, plant, s, flower, pollen, may, be, transferred, through, pollen, vectors, or, abiotic, carriers, such, as, wind, fertilization, begins, when, the, pollen, is, brought, to, a, female, gamete, through, the, pollen, tube, allogamy, is, also, known, as, cross, fertilization, in, contrast, to, autogamy, or, geitonogamy, which, are, methods, of, self, fertilization, self, fertilization, also, known, as, autogamy, occurs, in, hermaphroditic, organisms, where, the, two, gametes, fused, in, fertilization, come, from, the, same, individual, e, g, many, vascular, plants, some, foraminiferans, some, ciliates, the, term, autogamy, is, sometimes, substituted, for, autogamous, pollination, not, necessarily, leading, to, successful, fertilization, and, describes, self, pollination, within, the, same, flower, distinguished, from, geitonogamous, pollination, transfer, of, pollen, to, a, different, flower, on, the, same, flowering, plant, or, within, a, single, monoecious, gymnosperm, plant, mitosis, and, meiosis, are, types, of, cell, division, mitosis, occurs, in, somatic, cells, while, meiosis, occurs, in, gametes, mitosis, the, resultant, number, of, cells, in, mitosis, is, twice, the, number, of, original, cells, the, number, of, chromosomes, in, the, offspring, cells, is, the, same, as, that, of, the, parent, cell, meiosis, the, resultant, number, of, cells, is, four, times, the, number, of, original, cells, this, results, in, cells, with, half, the, number, of, chromosomes, present, in, the, parent, cell, a, diploid, cell, duplicates, itself, then, undergoes, two, divisions, tetraploid, to, diploid, to, haploid, in, the, process, forming, four, haploid, cells, this, process, occurs, in, two, phases, meiosis, i, and, meiosis, ii, scientific, research, is, currently, investigating, the, possibility, of, same, sex, procreation, which, would, produce, offspring, with, equal, genetic, contributions, from, either, two, females, or, two, males, the, obvious, approaches, subject, to, a, growing, amount, of, activity, are, female, sperm, and, male, eggs, in, 2004, by, altering, the, function, of, a, few, genes, involved, with, imprinting, other, japanese, scientists, combined, two, mouse, eggs, to, produce, daughter, mice, and, in, 2018, chinese, scientists, created, 29, female, mice, from, two, female, mice, mothers, but, were, unable, to, produce, viable, offspring, from, two, father, mice, researches, noted, that, there, is, little, chance, these, techniques, would, be, applied, to, humans, in, the, near, future, there, are, a, wide, range, of, reproductive, strategies, employed, by, different, species, some, animals, such, as, the, human, and, northern, gannet, do, not, reach, sexual, maturity, for, many, years, after, birth, and, even, then, produce, few, offspring, others, reproduce, quickly, but, under, normal, circumstances, most, offspring, do, not, survive, to, adulthood, for, example, a, rabbit, mature, after, 8, months, can, produce, 10, 30, offspring, per, year, and, a, fruit, fly, mature, after, 10, 14, days, can, produce, up, to, 900, offspring, per, year, these, two, main, strategies, are, known, as, k, selection, few, offspring, and, r, selection, many, offspring, which, strategy, is, favoured, by, evolution, depends, on, a, variety, of, circumstances, animals, with, few, offspring, can, devote, more, resources, to, the, nurturing, and, protection, of, each, individual, offspring, thus, reducing, the, need, for, many, offspring, on, the, other, hand, animals, with, many, offspring, may, devote, fewer, resources, to, each, individual, offspring, for, these, types, of, animals, it, is, common, for, many, offspring, to, die, soon, after, birth, but, enough, individuals, typically, survive, to, maintain, the, population, some, organisms, such, as, honey, bees, and, fruit, flies, retain, sperm, in, a, process, called, sperm, storage, thereby, increasing, the, duration, of, their, fertility, organisms, that, reproduce, through, asexual, reproduction, tend, to, grow, in, number, exponentially, however, because, they, rely, on, mutation, for, variations, in, their, dna, all, members, of, the, species, have, similar, vulnerabilities, organisms, that, reproduce, sexually, yield, a, smaller, number, of, offspring, but, the, large, amount, of, variation, in, their, genes, makes, them, less, susceptible, to, disease, many, organisms, can, reproduce, sexually, as, well, as, asexually, aphids, slime, molds, sea, anemones, some, species, of, starfish, by, fragmentation, and, many, plants, are, examples, when, environmental, factors, are, favorable, asexual, reproduction, is, employed, to, exploit, suitable, conditions, for, survival, such, as, an, abundant, food, supply, adequate, shelter, favorable, climate, disease, optimum, ph, or, a, proper, mix, of, other, lifestyle, requirements, populations, of, these, organisms, increase, exponentially, via, asexual, reproductive, strategies, to, take, full, advantage, of, the, rich, supply, resources, when, food, sources, have, been, depleted, the, climate, becomes, hostile, or, individual, survival, is, jeopardized, by, some, other, adverse, change, in, living, conditions, these, organisms, switch, to, sexual, forms, of, reproduction, sexual, reproduction, ensures, a, mixing, of, the, gene, pool, of, the, species, the, variations, found, in, offspring, of, sexual, reproduction, allow, some, individuals, to, be, better, suited, for, survival, and, provide, a, mechanism, for, selective, adaptation, to, occur, the, meiosis, stage, of, the, sexual, cycle, also, allows, especially, effective, repair, of, dna, damages, see, meiosis, in, addition, sexual, reproduction, usually, results, in, the, formation, of, a, life, stage, that, is, able, to, endure, the, conditions, that, threaten, the, offspring, of, an, asexual, parent, thus, seeds, spores, eggs, pupae, cysts, or, other, over, wintering, stages, of, sexual, reproduction, ensure, the, survival, during, unfavorable, times, and, the, organism, can, wait, out, adverse, situations, until, a, swing, back, to, suitability, occurs, the, existence, of, life, without, reproduction, is, the, subject, of, some, speculation, the, biological, study, of, how, the, origin, of, life, produced, reproducing, organisms, from, non, reproducing, elements, is, called, abiogenesis, whether, or, not, there, were, several, independent, abiogenetic, events, biologists, believe, that, the, last, universal, ancestor, to, all, present, life, on, earth, lived, about, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, scientists, have, speculated, about, the, possibility, of, creating, life, non, reproductively, in, the, laboratory, several, scientists, have, succeeded, in, producing, simple, viruses, from, entirely, non, living, materials, however, viruses, are, often, regarded, as, not, alive, being, nothing, more, than, a, bit, of, rna, or, dna, in, a, protein, capsule, they, have, no, metabolism, and, can, only, replicate, with, the, assistance, of, a, hijacked, cell, s, metabolic, machinery, the, production, of, a, truly, living, organism, e, g, a, simple, bacterium, with, no, ancestors, would, be, a, much, more, complex, task, but, may, well, be, possible, to, some, degree, according, to, current, biological, knowledge, a, synthetic, genome, has, been, transferred, into, an, existing, bacterium, where, it, replaced, the, native, dna, resulting, in, the, artificial, production, of, a, new, m, mycoides, organism, there, is, some, debate, within, the, scientific, community, over, whether, this, cell, can, be, considered, completely, synthetic, on, the, grounds, that, the, chemically, synthesized, genome, was, an, almost, 1, 1, copy, of, a, naturally, occurring, genome, and, the, recipient, cell, was, a, naturally, occurring, bacterium, the, craig, venter, institute, maintains, the, term, synthetic, bacterial, cell, but, they, also, clarify, we, do, not, consider, this, to, be, creating, life, from, scratch, but, rather, we, are, creating, new, life, out, of, already, existing, life, using, synthetic, dna, venter, plans, to, patent, his, experimental, cells, stating, that, they, are, pretty, clearly, human, inventions, its, creators, suggests, that, building, synthetic, life, would, allow, researchers, to, learn, about, life, by, building, it, rather, than, by, tearing, it, apart, they, also, propose, to, stretch, the, boundaries, between, life, and, machines, until, the, two, overlap, to, yield, truly, programmable, organisms, researchers, involved, stated, that, the, creation, of, true, synthetic, biochemical, life, is, relatively, close, in, reach, with, current, technology, and, cheap, compared, to, the, effort, needed, to, place, man, on, the, moon, sexual, reproduction, has, many, drawbacks, since, it, requires, far, more, energy, than, asexual, reproduction, and, diverts, the, organisms, from, other, pursuits, and, there, is, some, argument, about, why, so, many, species, use, it, george, c, williams, used, lottery, tickets, as, an, analogy, in, one, explanation, for, the, widespread, use, of, sexual, reproduction, he, argued, that, asexual, reproduction, which, produces, little, or, no, genetic, variety, in, offspring, was, like, buying, many, tickets, that, all, have, the, same, number, limiting, the, chance, of, winning, that, is, producing, surviving, offspring, sexual, reproduction, he, argued, was, like, purchasing, fewer, tickets, but, with, a, greater, variety, of, numbers, and, therefore, a, greater, chance, of, success, the, point, of, this, analogy, is, that, since, asexual, reproduction, does, not, produce, genetic, variations, there, is, little, ability, to, quickly, adapt, to, a, changing, environment, the, lottery, principle, is, less, accepted, these, days, because, of, evidence, that, asexual, reproduction, is, more, prevalent, in, unstable, environments, the, opposite, of, what, it, predicts
