the, cerebrum, pl, cerebra, telencephalon, or, endbrain, is, the, largest, part, of, the, brain, containing, the, cerebral, cortex, of, the, two, cerebral, hemispheres, as, well, as, several, subcortical, structures, including, the, hippocampus, basal, ganglia, and, olfactory, bulb, in, the, human, brain, the, cerebrum, is, the, uppermost, region, of, the, central, nervous, system, the, cerebrum, develops, prenatally, from, the, forebrain, prosencephalon, in, mammals, the, dorsal, telencephalon, or, pallium, develops, into, the, cerebral, cortex, and, the, ventral, telencephalon, or, subpallium, becomes, the, basal, ganglia, the, cerebrum, is, also, divided, into, approximately, symmetric, left, and, right, cerebral, hemispheres, with, the, assistance, of, the, cerebellum, the, cerebrum, controls, all, voluntary, actions, in, the, human, body, the, cerebrum, is, the, largest, part, of, the, brain, depending, upon, the, position, of, the, animal, it, lies, either, in, front, or, on, top, of, the, brainstem, in, humans, the, cerebrum, is, the, largest, and, best, developed, of, the, five, major, divisions, of, the, brain, the, cerebrum, is, made, up, of, the, two, cerebral, hemispheres, and, their, cerebral, cortices, the, outer, layers, of, grey, matter, and, the, underlying, regions, of, white, matter, its, subcortical, structures, include, the, hippocampus, basal, ganglia, and, olfactory, bulb, the, cerebrum, consists, of, two, c, shaped, cerebral, hemispheres, separated, from, each, other, by, a, deep, fissure, called, the, longitudinal, fissure, the, cerebral, cortex, the, outer, layer, of, grey, matter, of, the, cerebrum, is, found, only, in, mammals, in, larger, mammals, including, humans, the, surface, of, the, cerebral, cortex, folds, to, create, gyri, ridges, and, sulci, furrows, which, increase, the, surface, area, the, cerebral, cortex, is, generally, classified, into, four, lobes, the, frontal, parietal, occipital, and, temporal, lobes, the, lobes, are, classified, based, on, their, overlying, neurocranial, bones, a, smaller, lobe, is, the, insular, lobe, a, part, of, the, cerebral, cortex, folded, deep, within, the, lateral, sulcus, that, separates, the, temporal, lobe, from, the, parietal, and, frontal, lobes, is, located, within, each, hemisphere, of, the, mammalian, brain, the, cerebrum, is, divided, by, the, medial, longitudinal, fissure, into, two, cerebral, hemispheres, the, right, and, the, left, the, cerebrum, is, contralaterally, organized, i, e, the, right, hemisphere, controls, and, processes, signals, predominantly, from, the, left, side, of, the, body, while, the, left, hemisphere, controls, and, processes, signals, predominantly, from, the, right, side, of, the, body, according, to, current, knowledge, this, is, due, to, an, axial, twist, that, occurs, in, the, early, embryo, there, is, a, strong, but, not, complete, bilateral, symmetry, between, the, hemispheres, while, lateralization, tends, to, increase, with, increasing, brain, size, the, lateralization, of, brain, function, looks, at, the, known, and, possible, differences, between, the, two, in, the, developing, vertebrate, embryo, the, neural, tube, is, subdivided, into, four, unseparated, sections, which, then, develop, further, into, distinct, regions, of, the, central, nervous, system, these, are, the, prosencephalon, forebrain, the, mesencephalon, midbrain, the, rhombencephalon, hindbrain, and, the, spinal, cord, the, prosencephalon, develops, further, into, the, telencephalon, and, the, diencephalon, the, dorsal, telencephalon, gives, rise, to, the, pallium, cerebral, cortex, in, mammals, and, reptiles, and, the, ventral, telencephalon, generates, the, basal, ganglia, the, diencephalon, develops, into, the, thalamus, and, hypothalamus, including, the, optic, vesicles, future, retina, the, dorsal, telencephalon, then, forms, two, lateral, telencephalic, vesicles, separated, by, the, midline, which, develop, into, the, left, and, right, cerebral, hemispheres, birds, and, fish, have, a, dorsal, telencephalon, like, all, vertebrates, but, it, is, generally, unlayered, and, therefore, not, considered, a, cerebral, cortex, only, a, layered, cytoarchitecture, can, be, considered, a, cortex, note, as, the, cerebrum, is, a, gross, division, with, many, subdivisions, and, sub, regions, it, is, important, to, state, that, this, section, lists, only, functions, that, the, cerebrum, as, a, whole, serves, see, main, articles, on, cerebral, cortex, and, basal, ganglia, for, more, information, the, cerebrum, is, a, major, part, of, the, brain, controlling, emotions, hearing, vision, personality, and, much, more, it, controls, all, precision, of, voluntary, actions, upper, motor, neurons, in, the, primary, motor, cortex, send, their, axons, to, the, brainstem, and, spinal, cord, to, synapse, on, the, lower, motor, neurons, which, innervate, the, muscles, damage, to, motor, areas, of, the, cortex, can, lead, to, certain, types, of, motor, neuron, disease, this, kind, of, damage, results, in, loss, of, muscular, power, and, precision, rather, than, total, paralysis, it, functions, as, the, center, of, sensory, perception, memory, thoughts, and, judgement, the, cerebrum, also, functions, as, the, center, of, voluntary, motor, activities, the, primary, sensory, areas, of, the, cerebral, cortex, receive, and, process, visual, auditory, somatosensory, gustatory, and, olfactory, information, together, with, association, cortical, areas, these, brain, regions, synthesize, sensory, information, into, our, perceptions, of, the, world, the, olfactory, bulb, responsible, for, the, sense, of, smell, takes, up, a, large, area, of, the, cerebrum, in, most, vertebrates, however, in, humans, this, part, of, the, brain, is, much, smaller, and, lies, underneath, the, frontal, lobe, the, olfactory, sensory, system, is, unique, since, the, neurons, in, the, olfactory, bulb, send, their, axons, directly, to, the, olfactory, cortex, rather, than, to, the, thalamus, first, olfaction, is, also, the, only, sense, that, is, represented, by, the, ipsilateral, side, of, the, brain, damage, to, the, olfactory, bulb, results, in, a, loss, of, olfaction, the, sense, of, smell, speech, and, language, are, mainly, attributed, to, parts, of, the, cerebral, cortex, motor, portions, of, language, are, attributed, to, broca, s, area, within, the, frontal, lobe, speech, comprehension, is, attributed, to, wernicke, s, area, at, the, temporal, parietal, lobe, junction, these, two, regions, are, interconnected, by, a, large, white, matter, tract, the, arcuate, fasciculus, damage, to, the, broca, s, area, results, in, expressive, aphasia, non, fluent, aphasia, while, damage, to, wernicke, s, area, results, in, receptive, aphasia, also, called, fluent, aphasia, explicit, or, declarative, factual, memory, formation, is, attributed, to, the, hippocampus, and, associated, regions, of, the, medial, temporal, lobe, this, association, was, originally, described, after, a, patient, known, as, hm, had, both, his, left, and, right, hippocampus, surgically, removed, to, treat, chronic, after, surgery, hm, had, anterograde, amnesia, or, the, inability, to, form, new, memories, implicit, or, procedural, memory, such, as, complex, motor, behaviors, involves, the, basal, ganglia, short, term, or, working, memory, involves, association, areas, of, the, cortex, especially, the, dorsolateral, prefrontal, cortex, as, well, as, the, hippocampus, in, the, most, primitive, vertebrates, the, hagfishes, and, lampreys, the, cerebrum, is, a, relatively, simple, structure, receiving, nerve, impulses, from, the, olfactory, bulb, in, cartilaginous, and, lobe, finned, fishes, and, also, in, amphibians, a, more, complex, structure, is, present, with, the, cerebrum, being, divided, into, three, distinct, regions, the, lowermost, or, ventral, region, forms, the, basal, nuclei, and, contains, fibres, connecting, the, rest, of, the, cerebrum, to, the, thalamus, above, this, and, forming, the, lateral, part, of, the, cerebrum, is, the, paleopallium, while, the, uppermost, or, dorsal, part, is, referred, to, as, the, archipallium, the, cerebrum, remains, largely, devoted, to, olfactory, sensation, in, these, animals, in, contrast, to, its, much, wider, range, of, functions, in, amniotes, in, ray, finned, fishes, the, structure, is, somewhat, different, the, inner, surfaces, of, the, lateral, and, ventral, regions, of, the, cerebrum, bulge, up, into, the, ventricles, these, include, both, the, basal, nuclei, and, the, various, parts, of, the, pallium, and, may, be, complex, in, structure, especially, in, teleosts, the, dorsal, surface, of, the, cerebrum, is, membranous, and, does, not, contain, any, nervous, tissue, in, the, amniotes, the, cerebrum, becomes, increasingly, large, and, complex, in, reptiles, the, paleopallium, is, much, larger, than, in, amphibians, and, its, growth, has, pushed, the, basal, nuclei, into, the, central, regions, of, the, cerebrum, as, in, the, lower, vertebrates, the, grey, matter, is, generally, located, beneath, the, white, matter, but, in, some, reptiles, it, spreads, out, to, the, surface, to, form, a, primitive, cortex, especially, in, the, anterior, part, of, the, brain, in, mammals, this, development, proceeds, further, so, that, the, cortex, covers, almost, the, whole, of, the, cerebral, hemispheres, especially, in, more, developed, species, such, as, the, primates, the, paleopallium, is, pushed, to, the, ventral, surface, of, the, brain, where, it, becomes, the, olfactory, lobes, while, the, archipallium, becomes, rolled, over, at, the, medial, dorsal, edge, to, form, the, hippocampus, in, placental, mammals, a, corpus, callosum, also, develops, further, connecting, the, two, hemispheres, the, complex, convolutions, of, the, cerebral, surface, see, gyrus, gyrification, are, also, found, only, in, higher, mammals, although, some, large, mammals, such, as, elephants, have, particularly, large, cerebra, dolphins, are, the, only, species, other, than, humans, to, have, cerebra, accounting, for, as, much, as, 2, percent, of, their, body, weight, the, cerebra, of, birds, are, similarly, enlarged, to, those, of, mammals, by, comparison, with, reptiles, the, increased, size, of, bird, brains, was, classically, attributed, to, enlarged, basal, ganglia, with, the, other, areas, remaining, primitive, but, this, view, has, been, largely, abandoned, birds, appear, to, have, undergone, an, alternate, process, of, encephalization, as, they, diverged, from, the, other, archosaurs, with, few, clear, parallels, to, that, experienced, by, mammals, and, their, therapsid, ancestors
