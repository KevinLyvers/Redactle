sometimes, known, as, spiny, anteaters, are, quill, covered, monotremes, egg, laying, mammals, belonging, to, the, family, tachyglossidae, t, k, i, l, s, d, i, living, in, australia, and, new, guinea, the, four, extant, species, of, echidnas, and, the, platypus, are, the, only, living, mammals, that, lay, eggs, and, the, only, surviving, members, of, the, order, monotremata, the, diet, of, some, species, consists, of, ants, and, termites, but, they, are, not, closely, related, to, the, american, true, anteaters, or, to, hedgehogs, their, young, are, called, puggles, echidnas, evolved, between, 20, and, 50, million, years, ago, descending, from, a, platypus, like, monotreme, this, ancestor, was, aquatic, but, echidnas, adapted, to, life, on, land, echidnas, are, possibly, named, after, echidna, a, creature, from, greek, mythology, who, was, half, woman, half, snake, as, the, animal, was, perceived, to, have, qualities, of, both, mammals, and, reptiles, an, alternative, explanation, is, a, confusion, with, ancient, greek, romanized, ekh, nos, lit, hedgehog, sea, urchin, echidnas, are, medium, sized, solitary, mammals, covered, with, coarse, hair, and, spines, the, spines, are, modified, hairs, and, are, made, of, keratin, the, same, fibrous, protein, that, makes, up, fur, claws, nails, and, horn, sheaths, in, animals, superficially, they, resemble, the, anteaters, of, south, america, and, other, spiny, mammals, such, as, hedgehogs, and, porcupines, they, are, usually, black, or, brown, in, coloration, there, have, been, several, reports, of, albino, echidnas, with, pink, eyes, and, white, spines, they, have, elongated, and, slender, snouts, that, function, as, both, mouth, and, nose, and, which, have, electrosensors, to, find, earthworms, termites, ants, and, other, burrowing, prey, this, is, similar, to, the, platypus, which, has, 40, 000, electroreceptors, on, its, bill, but, the, long, beaked, echidna, has, only, 2, 000, while, the, short, beaked, echidna, which, lives, in, a, drier, environment, has, no, more, than, 400, at, the, tip, of, its, snout, echidnas, have, short, strong, limbs, with, large, claws, and, are, powerful, diggers, their, hind, claws, are, elongated, and, curved, backwards, to, aid, in, digging, echidnas, have, tiny, mouths, and, toothless, jaws, and, feed, by, tearing, open, soft, logs, anthills, and, the, like, and, licking, off, prey, with, their, long, sticky, tongues, the, ears, are, slits, on, the, sides, of, their, heads, under, the, spines, the, external, ear, is, created, by, a, large, cartilaginous, funnel, deep, in, the, muscle, at, 33, c, 91, 4, f, echidnas, also, possess, the, second, lowest, active, body, temperature, of, all, mammals, behind, the, platypus, despite, their, appearance, echidnas, are, capable, swimmers, as, they, evolved, from, platypus, like, ancestors, when, swimming, they, expose, their, snout, and, some, of, their, spines, and, are, known, to, journey, to, water, to, bathe, the, first, european, drawing, of, an, echidna, was, made, in, adventure, bay, tasmania, by, hms, providence, s, third, lieutenant, george, tobin, during, william, bligh, s, second, breadfruit, voyage, the, short, beaked, echidna, s, diet, consists, mostly, of, ants, and, termites, while, the, zaglossus, long, beaked, species, typically, eat, worms, and, insect, larvae, the, tongues, of, long, beaked, echidnas, have, sharp, tiny, spines, that, help, them, capture, their, prey, they, have, no, teeth, so, they, break, down, their, food, by, grinding, it, between, the, bottoms, of, their, mouths, and, their, tongues, echidnas, faeces, are, 7, cm, 3, in, long, and, are, cylindrical, in, shape, they, are, usually, broken, and, unrounded, and, composed, largely, of, dirt, and, ant, hill, material, like, all, mammals, echidnas, feed, their, young, on, milk, which, contains, various, factors, to, sustain, their, growth, and, development, echidnas, do, not, tolerate, extreme, temperatures, they, shelter, from, harsh, weather, in, caves, and, rock, crevices, echidnas, are, found, in, forests, and, woodlands, hiding, under, vegetation, roots, or, piles, of, debris, they, sometimes, use, the, burrows, both, abandoned, and, in, use, of, animals, such, as, rabbits, and, wombats, individual, echidnas, have, large, mutually, overlapping, territories, echidnas, and, platypuses, are, the, only, egg, laying, mammals, the, monotremes, the, average, lifespan, of, an, echidna, in, the, wild, is, estimated, at, 14, 16, years, fully, grown, females, can, weigh, about, 4, 5, kilograms, 9, 9, lb, the, males, 33, larger, at, about, 6, kilograms, 13, lb, though, the, internal, reproductive, organs, differ, both, sexes, possess, an, identical, single, cloaca, opening, for, urination, defecation, and, mating, male, echidnas, have, non, venomous, spurs, on, the, hind, feet, similar, to, the, venomous, male, platypus, due, to, their, low, metabolism, and, accompanying, stress, resistance, echidnas, are, long, lived, for, their, size, the, longest, recorded, lifespan, for, a, captive, echidna, is, 50, years, with, anecdotal, accounts, of, wild, individuals, reaching, 45, years, the, echidna, s, brain, is, half, neocortex, compared, to, 80, of, a, human, brain, contrary, to, previous, research, the, echidna, does, enter, rem, sleep, but, only, in, a, comfortable, temperature, around, 25, c, 77, f, at, lower, or, higher, temperatures, of, 15, c, 59, f, and, 28, c, 82, f, rem, sleep, is, suppressed, the, female, lays, a, single, soft, shelled, leathery, egg, 22, days, after, mating, and, deposits, it, directly, into, her, pouch, an, egg, weighs, 1, 5, to, 2, grams, 0, 05, to, 0, 07, oz, and, is, about, 1, 4, centimetres, 0, 55, in, long, while, hatching, the, baby, echidna, opens, the, leather, shell, with, a, reptile, like, egg, tooth, hatching, takes, place, after, 10, days, of, gestation, the, young, echidna, called, a, puggle, born, larval, and, fetus, like, then, sucks, milk, from, the, pores, of, the, two, milk, patches, monotremes, have, no, nipples, and, remains, in, the, pouch, for, 45, to, 55, days, at, which, time, it, starts, to, develop, spines, the, mother, digs, a, nursery, burrow, and, deposits, the, young, returning, every, five, days, to, suckle, it, until, it, is, weaned, at, seven, months, puggles, will, stay, within, their, mother, s, den, for, up, to, a, year, before, leaving, male, echidnas, have, a, four, headed, penis, during, mating, the, heads, on, one, side, shut, down, and, do, not, grow, in, size, the, other, two, are, used, to, release, semen, into, the, female, s, two, branched, reproductive, tract, each, time, it, copulates, it, alternates, heads, in, sets, of, two, when, not, in, use, the, penis, is, retracted, inside, a, preputial, sac, in, the, cloaca, the, male, echidna, s, penis, is, 7, centimetres, 2, 8, in, long, when, erect, and, its, shaft, is, covered, with, penile, spines, these, may, be, used, to, induce, ovulation, in, the, female, it, is, a, challenge, to, study, the, echidna, in, its, natural, habitat, and, they, show, no, interest, in, mating, while, in, captivity, prior, to, 2007, no, one, had, ever, seen, an, echidna, ejaculate, there, have, been, previous, attempts, trying, to, force, the, echidna, to, ejaculate, through, the, use, of, electrically, stimulated, ejaculation, in, order, to, obtain, semen, samples, but, this, has, only, resulted, in, the, penis, swelling, breeding, season, begins, in, late, june, and, extends, through, september, during, mating, season, a, female, may, be, followed, by, a, line, or, train, of, up, to, 10, males, the, youngest, trailing, last, and, some, males, switching, between, lines, echidnas, are, very, timid, when, frightened, they, attempt, to, partially, bury, themselves, and, curl, into, a, ball, similar, to, a, hedgehog, strong, front, arms, allow, echidnas, to, dig, in, and, hold, fast, against, a, predator, pulling, them, from, the, hole, their, many, predators, include, feral, cats, foxes, domestic, dogs, and, goannas, snakes, pose, a, large, threat, when, they, slither, into, echidna, burrows, and, prey, on, the, spineless, young, puggles, they, are, easily, stressed, and, injured, by, handling, some, ways, to, help, echidnas, include, picking, up, litter, causing, less, pollution, planting, vegetation, for, shelter, supervising, pets, reporting, hurt, echidnas, and, leaving, them, undisturbed, the, divergence, between, oviparous, egg, laying, and, viviparous, offspring, develop, internally, mammals, is, believed, to, date, to, the, triassic, period, most, findings, from, genetics, studies, especially, of, nuclear, genes, are, in, agreement, with, the, paleontological, dating, but, some, other, evidence, like, mitochondrial, dna, give, slightly, different, dates, molecular, clock, data, suggest, echidnas, split, from, platypuses, between, 19, and, 48, million, years, ago, so, that, platypus, like, fossils, dating, back, to, over, 112, 5, million, years, ago, represent, basal, forms, rather, than, close, relatives, of, the, modern, platypus, this, would, imply, that, echidnas, evolved, from, water, foraging, ancestors, that, returned, to, land, living, which, put, them, in, competition, with, marsupials, although, extant, monotremes, lack, adult, teeth, platypuses, have, teeth, only, as, juveniles, many, extinct, monotreme, species, have, been, identified, based, on, the, morphology, of, their, teeth, of, the, eight, genes, involved, in, tooth, development, four, have, been, lost, in, both, platypus, and, echidna, indicating, that, the, loss, of, teeth, occurred, before, the, echidna, platypus, split, further, evidence, of, water, foraging, ancestors, can, be, found, in, some, of, the, echidna, s, anatomy, including, hydrodynamic, streamlining, dorsally, projecting, hind, limbs, acting, as, rudders, and, locomotion, founded, on, hypertrophied, humeral, long, axis, rotation, which, provides, an, efficient, swimming, stroke, oviparous, reproduction, in, monotremes, may, give, them, an, advantage, over, marsupials, in, some, environments, their, observed, adaptive, radiation, contradicts, the, assumption, that, monotremes, are, frozen, in, morphological, and, molecular, evolution, it, has, been, suggested, that, echidnas, originally, evolved, in, new, guinea, when, it, was, isolated, from, australia, and, from, marsupials, this, would, explain, their, rarity, in, the, fossil, record, their, abundance, in, present, times, in, new, guinea, and, their, original, adaptation, to, terrestrial, niches, presumably, without, competition, from, marsupials, tachyglossus, aculeatus, z, bartoni, z, attenboroughi, z, bruijnii, echidnas, are, a, small, clade, with, two, extant, genera, and, four, species, the, genus, zaglossus, includes, three, extant, and, two, fossil, species, with, only, one, extant, species, from, the, genus, tachyglossus, the, three, living, zaglossus, species, are, endemic, to, new, guinea, they, are, rare, and, are, hunted, for, food, they, forage, in, leaf, litter, on, the, forest, floor, eating, earthworms, and, insects, the, species, are, the, one, fossil, species, is, the, short, beaked, echidna, tachyglossus, aculeatus, is, found, in, southern, southeast, and, northeast, new, guinea, and, also, occurs, in, almost, all, australian, environments, from, the, snow, clad, australian, alps, to, the, deep, deserts, of, the, outback, essentially, anywhere, ants, and, termites, are, available, it, is, smaller, than, the, zaglossus, species, and, it, has, longer, hair, despite, the, similar, dietary, habits, and, methods, of, consumption, to, those, of, an, anteater, there, is, no, evidence, supporting, the, idea, that, echidna, like, monotremes, have, been, myrmecophagic, ant, or, termite, eating, since, the, cretaceous, the, fossil, evidence, of, invertebrate, feeding, bandicoots, and, rat, kangaroos, from, around, the, time, of, the, platypus, echidna, divergence, and, pre, dating, tachyglossus, show, evidence, that, echidnas, expanded, into, new, ecospace, despite, competition, from, marsupials, additionally, extinct, echidnas, continue, to, be, described, by, taxonomists, the, genus, megalibgwilia, is, known, only, from, fossils, the, genus, murrayglossus, is, known, only, from, fossils, the, kunwinjku, people, of, western, arnhem, land, australia, call, the, echidna, ngarrbek, and, regard, it, as, a, prized, food, and, good, medicine, the, echidna, is, hunted, at, night, gutted, and, filled, with, hot, stones, and, mandak, persoonia, falcata, leaves, according, to, larrakia, elders, una, thompson, and, stephanie, thompson, nganjmirra, once, captured, an, echidna, is, carried, attached, to, the, wrist, like, a, thick, bangle
