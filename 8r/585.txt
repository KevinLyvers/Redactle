tortoises, t, r, t, s, z, tor, t, s, iz, are, reptiles, of, the, family, testudinidae, of, the, order, testudines, latin, for, tortoise, like, other, turtles, tortoises, have, a, shell, to, protect, from, predation, and, other, threats, the, shell, in, tortoises, is, generally, hard, and, like, other, members, of, the, suborder, cryptodira, they, retract, their, necks, and, heads, directly, backward, into, the, shell, to, protect, them, tortoises, can, vary, in, size, with, some, species, such, as, the, gal, pagos, giant, tortoise, growing, to, more, than, 1, 2, metres, 3, 9, ft, in, length, whereas, others, like, the, speckled, cape, tortoise, have, shells, that, measure, only, 6, 8, centimetres, 2, 7, in, long, several, lineages, of, tortoises, have, independently, evolved, very, large, body, sizes, in, excess, of, 100, kg, including, the, galapagos, giant, tortoise, and, the, aldabra, giant, tortoise, they, are, usually, diurnal, animals, with, tendencies, to, be, crepuscular, depending, on, the, ambient, temperatures, they, are, generally, reclusive, animals, tortoises, are, the, longest, living, land, animals, in, the, world, although, the, longest, living, species, of, tortoise, is, a, matter, of, debate, gal, pagos, tortoises, are, noted, to, live, over, 150, years, but, an, aldabra, giant, tortoise, named, adwaita, may, have, lived, an, estimated, 255, years, in, general, most, tortoise, species, can, live, 80, 150, years, tortoises, are, placid, and, slow, moving, with, an, average, walking, speed, of, 0, 2, 0, 5, km, h, differences, exist, in, usage, of, the, common, terms, turtle, tortoise, and, terrapin, depending, on, the, variety, of, english, being, used, usage, is, inconsistent, and, contradictory, these, terms, are, common, names, and, do, not, reflect, precise, biological, or, taxonomic, distinctions, the, american, society, of, ichthyologists, and, herpetologists, uses, turtle, to, describe, all, species, of, the, order, testudines, regardless, of, whether, they, are, land, dwelling, or, sea, dwelling, and, uses, tortoise, as, a, more, specific, term, for, slow, moving, terrestrial, species, general, american, usage, agrees, turtle, is, often, a, general, term, tortoise, is, used, only, in, reference, to, terrestrial, turtles, or, more, narrowly, only, those, members, of, testudinidae, the, family, of, modern, land, tortoises, and, terrapin, may, refer, to, turtles, that, are, small, and, live, in, fresh, and, brackish, water, in, particular, the, diamondback, terrapin, malaclemys, terrapin, in, america, for, example, the, members, of, the, genus, terrapene, dwell, on, land, yet, are, referred, to, as, box, turtles, rather, than, tortoises, british, usage, by, contrast, tends, not, to, use, turtle, as, a, generic, term, for, all, members, of, the, order, and, also, applies, the, term, tortoises, broadly, to, all, land, dwelling, members, of, the, order, testudines, regardless, of, whether, they, are, actually, members, of, the, family, testudinidae, in, britain, terrapin, is, used, to, refer, to, a, larger, group, of, semiaquatic, turtles, than, the, restricted, meaning, in, america, australian, usage, is, different, from, both, american, and, british, usage, land, tortoises, are, not, native, to, australia, and, traditionally, freshwater, turtles, have, been, called, tortoises, in, australia, some, australian, experts, disapprove, of, this, usage, believing, that, the, term, tortoises, is, better, confined, to, purely, terrestrial, animals, with, very, different, habits, and, needs, none, of, which, are, found, in, this, country, and, promote, the, use, of, the, term, freshwater, turtle, to, describe, australia, s, primarily, aquatic, members, of, the, order, testudines, because, it, avoids, misleading, use, of, the, word, tortoise, and, also, is, a, useful, distinction, from, marine, turtles, most, species, of, tortoises, lay, small, clutch, sizes, seldom, exceeding, 20, eggs, and, many, species, have, clutch, sizes, of, only, 1, 2, eggs, incubation, is, characteristically, long, in, most, species, the, average, incubation, period, are, between, 100, and, 160, 0, days, egg, laying, typically, occurs, at, night, after, which, the, mother, tortoise, covers, her, clutch, with, sand, soil, and, organic, material, the, eggs, are, left, unattended, and, depending, on, the, species, take, from, 60, to, 120, days, to, incubate, the, size, of, the, egg, depends, on, the, size, of, the, mother, and, can, be, estimated, by, examining, the, width, of, the, cloacal, opening, between, the, carapace, and, plastron, the, plastron, of, a, female, tortoise, often, has, a, noticeable, v, shaped, notch, below, the, tail, which, facilitates, passing, the, eggs, upon, completion, of, the, incubation, period, a, fully, formed, hatchling, uses, an, egg, tooth, to, break, out, of, its, shell, it, digs, to, the, surface, of, the, nest, and, begins, a, life, of, survival, on, its, own, they, are, hatched, with, an, embryonic, egg, sac, which, serves, as, a, source, of, nutrition, for, the, first, three, to, seven, days, until, they, have, the, strength, and, mobility, to, find, food, juvenile, tortoises, often, require, a, different, balance, of, nutrients, than, adults, so, may, eat, foods, which, a, more, mature, tortoise, would, not, for, example, the, young, of, a, strictly, herbivorous, species, commonly, will, consume, worms, or, insect, larvae, for, additional, protein, the, number, of, concentric, rings, on, the, carapace, much, like, the, cross, section, of, a, tree, can, sometimes, give, a, clue, to, how, old, the, animal, is, but, since, the, growth, depends, highly, on, the, accessibility, of, food, and, water, a, tortoise, that, has, access, to, plenty, of, forage, or, is, regularly, fed, by, its, owner, with, no, seasonal, variation, will, have, no, noticeable, rings, moreover, some, tortoises, grow, more, than, one, ring, per, season, and, in, some, others, due, to, wear, some, rings, are, no, longer, visible, tortoises, generally, have, one, of, the, longest, lifespans, of, any, animal, and, some, individuals, are, known, to, have, lived, longer, than, 150, years, because, of, this, they, symbolize, longevity, in, some, cultures, such, as, chinese, culture, the, oldest, tortoise, ever, recorded, and, one, of, the, oldest, individual, animals, ever, recorded, was, tu, i, malila, which, was, presented, to, the, tongan, royal, family, by, the, british, explorer, james, cook, shortly, after, its, birth, in, 1777, tu, i, malila, remained, in, the, care, of, the, tongan, royal, family, until, its, death, by, natural, causes, on, may, 19, 1965, at, the, age, of, 188, the, alipore, zoo, in, india, was, the, home, to, adwaita, which, zoo, officials, claimed, was, the, oldest, living, animal, until, its, death, on, march, 23, 2006, adwaita, also, spelled, addwaita, was, an, aldabra, giant, tortoise, brought, to, india, by, lord, wellesley, who, handed, it, over, to, the, alipur, zoological, gardens, in, 1875, when, the, zoo, was, set, up, west, bengal, officials, said, records, showed, adwaita, was, at, least, 150, years, old, but, other, evidence, pointed, to, 250, adwaita, was, said, to, be, the, pet, of, robert, clive, harriet, was, a, resident, at, the, australia, zoo, in, queensland, from, 1987, to, her, death, in, 2006, she, was, believed, to, have, been, brought, to, england, by, charles, darwin, aboard, the, beagle, and, then, on, to, australia, by, john, clements, wickham, harriet, died, on, june, 23, 2006, just, shy, of, her, 176th, birthday, timothy, a, female, spur, thighed, tortoise, lived, to, be, about, 165, years, old, for, 38, years, she, was, carried, as, a, mascot, aboard, various, ships, in, britain, s, royal, navy, then, in, 1892, at, age, 53, she, retired, to, the, grounds, of, powderham, castle, in, devon, up, to, the, time, of, her, death, in, 2004, she, was, believed, to, be, the, united, kingdom, s, oldest, resident, jonathan, a, seychelles, giant, tortoise, living, on, the, island, of, st, helena, may, be, as, old, as, 192, years, dna, analysis, of, the, genomes, of, the, long, lived, tortoises, lonesome, george, the, iconic, last, member, of, chelonoidis, abingdonii, and, the, aldabra, giant, tortoise, aldabrachelys, gigantea, led, to, the, detection, of, lineage, specific, variants, affecting, dna, repair, genes, that, might, contribute, to, their, long, lifespan, many, species, of, tortoises, are, sexually, dimorphic, though, the, differences, between, males, and, females, vary, from, species, to, species, in, some, species, males, have, a, longer, more, protruding, neck, plate, than, their, female, counterparts, while, in, others, the, claws, are, longer, on, the, females, the, male, plastron, is, curved, inwards, to, aid, reproduction, the, easiest, way, to, determine, the, sex, of, a, tortoise, is, to, look, at, the, tail, the, females, as, a, general, rule, have, smaller, tails, dropped, down, whereas, the, males, have, much, longer, tails, which, are, usually, pulled, up, and, to, the, side, of, the, rear, shell, the, brain, of, a, tortoise, is, extremely, small, red, footed, tortoises, from, central, and, south, america, do, not, have, an, area, in, the, brain, called, the, hippocampus, which, relates, to, emotion, learning, memory, and, spatial, navigation, studies, have, shown, that, red, footed, tortoises, may, rely, on, an, area, of, the, brain, called, the, medial, cortex, for, emotional, actions, an, area, that, humans, use, for, actions, such, as, decision, making, in, the, 17th, century, francesco, redi, performed, an, experiment, that, involved, removing, the, brain, of, a, land, tortoise, which, then, proceeded, to, live, six, months, freshwater, tortoises, when, subjected, to, the, same, experiment, continued, similarly, but, did, not, live, so, long, redi, also, cut, the, head, off, a, tortoise, entirely, and, it, lived, for, 23, days, tortoises, are, found, from, southern, north, america, to, southern, south, america, around, the, mediterranean, basin, across, eurasia, to, southeast, asia, in, sub, saharan, africa, madagascar, and, some, pacific, islands, they, are, absent, from, australasia, they, live, in, diverse, habitats, including, deserts, arid, grasslands, and, scrub, to, wet, evergreen, forests, and, from, sea, level, to, mountains, most, species, however, occupy, semiarid, habitats, many, large, islands, are, or, were, characterized, by, species, of, giant, tortoises, part, of, the, reason, for, this, is, that, tortoises, are, good, at, oceanic, dispersal, despite, being, unable, to, swim, tortoises, are, able, to, survive, long, periods, adrift, at, sea, because, they, can, survive, months, without, food, or, fresh, water, tortoises, have, been, known, to, survive, oceanic, dispersals, of, more, than, 740, km, once, on, islands, tortoises, faced, few, predators, or, competitors, and, could, grow, to, large, sizes, and, become, the, dominant, large, herbivores, on, many, islands, due, to, their, low, metabolic, rate, and, reduced, need, for, fresh, water, compared, to, mammals, today, there, are, only, two, living, species, of, giant, tortoises, the, aldabra, giant, tortoise, on, aldabra, atoll, and, the, dozen, subspecies, of, galapagos, giant, tortoise, found, on, the, galapagos, islands, however, until, recently, giant, tortoises, could, be, found, on, nearly, every, major, island, group, including, the, bahamas, the, greater, antilles, including, cuba, and, hispaniola, the, lesser, antilles, the, canary, islands, malta, the, seychelles, the, mascarene, islands, including, mauritius, and, reunion, and, madagascar, most, of, these, tortoises, were, wiped, out, by, human, arrival, many, of, these, giant, tortoises, are, not, closely, related, belonging, to, different, genera, such, as, megalochelys, chelonoidis, centrochelys, aldabrachelys, cylindraspis, and, hesperotestudo, but, are, thought, to, have, independently, evolved, large, body, size, through, convergent, evolution, giant, tortoises, are, notably, absent, from, australasia, and, many, south, pacific, islands, but, the, distantly, related, meiolaniid, turtles, are, thought, to, have, filled, the, same, niche, giant, tortoises, are, also, known, from, the, oligocene, pliocene, of, mainland, north, america, south, america, europe, asia, and, africa, but, are, all, now, extinct, which, is, also, attributed, to, human, activity, tortoises, are, generally, considered, to, be, strict, herbivores, feeding, on, grasses, weeds, leafy, greens, flowers, and, some, fruits, however, hunting, and, eating, of, birds, has, been, observed, on, occasion, pet, tortoises, typically, require, diets, based, on, wild, grasses, weeds, leafy, greens, and, certain, flowers, certain, species, consume, worms, or, insects, and, carrion, in, their, normal, habitats, too, much, protein, is, detrimental, in, herbivorous, species, and, has, been, associated, with, shell, deformities, and, other, medical, problems, different, tortoise, species, vary, greatly, in, their, nutritional, requirements, communication, in, tortoises, is, different, from, many, other, reptiles, because, they, are, restricted, by, their, shell, and, short, limbs, visual, communication, is, not, a, strong, form, of, communication, in, tortoises, tortoises, use, olfactory, cues, to, determine, the, sex, of, other, tortoises, so, that, they, can, find, a, potential, mate, tactile, communication, is, important, in, tortoises, during, combat, and, courtship, in, both, combat, and, courtship, tortoises, use, ramming, to, communicate, with, other, individuals, this, species, list, largely, follows, turtle, taxonomy, working, group, 2021, and, the, turtle, extinctions, working, group, 2015, family, testudinidae, batsch, 1788, a,
