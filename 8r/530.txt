all, other, members, of, salmoninae, salmon, s, m, n, pl, salmon, is, the, common, name, for, several, commercially, important, species, of, euryhaline, ray, finned, fish, from, the, genera, salmo, and, oncorhynchus, of, the, family, salmonidae, native, to, tributaries, of, the, north, atlantic, salmo, and, north, pacific, oncorhynchus, basins, other, closely, related, fish, in, the, same, family, include, trout, char, grayling, whitefish, lenok, and, taimen, all, coldwater, fish, of, the, subarctic, and, cooler, temperate, regions, with, some, sporadic, endorheic, populations, in, central, asia, salmon, are, typically, anadromous, they, hatch, in, the, shallow, gravel, beds, of, freshwater, headstreams, and, spend, their, juvenile, years, in, rivers, lakes, and, freshwater, wetlands, migrate, to, the, ocean, as, adults, and, live, like, sea, fish, then, return, to, their, freshwater, birthplace, to, reproduce, however, populations, of, several, species, are, restricted, to, fresh, waters, i, e, landlocked, throughout, their, lives, folklore, has, it, that, the, fish, return, to, the, exact, stream, where, they, themselves, hatched, to, spawn, and, tracking, studies, have, shown, this, to, be, mostly, true, a, portion, of, a, returning, salmon, run, may, stray, and, spawn, in, different, freshwater, systems, the, percent, of, straying, depends, on, the, species, of, salmon, homing, behavior, has, been, shown, to, depend, on, olfactory, memory, salmon, are, important, food, fish, and, are, intensively, farmed, in, many, parts, of, the, world, with, norway, being, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, farmed, salmon, followed, by, chile, they, are, also, highly, prized, game, fish, for, recreational, fishing, by, both, freshwater, and, saltwater, anglers, many, species, of, salmon, have, since, been, introduced, and, naturalized, into, non, native, environments, such, as, the, great, lakes, of, north, america, patagonia, in, south, america, and, south, island, of, new, zealand, the, modern, english, term, salmon, is, derived, from, middle, english, samoun, samon, and, saumon, which, in, turn, are, from, anglo, norman, saumon, from, old, french, saumon, and, from, latin, salm, which, in, turn, might, have, originated, from, salire, meaning, to, leap, the, unpronounced, l, absent, from, middle, english, was, later, added, as, a, latinisation, to, make, the, word, closer, to, its, latin, root, the, term, salmon, has, mostly, displaced, its, now, dialectal, synonym, lax, in, turn, from, middle, english, lax, from, old, english, leax, from, proto, germanic, lahsaz, from, proto, indo, european, lakso, the, seven, commercially, important, species, of, salmon, occur, in, two, genera, of, the, subfamily, salmoninae, the, genus, salmo, contains, the, atlantic, salmon, found, in, both, sides, of, the, north, atlantic, as, well, as, more, than, 40, other, species, commonly, named, as, trout, the, genus, oncorhynchus, contains, 12, recognised, species, which, occur, naturally, only, in, the, north, pacific, six, of, which, are, known, as, pacific, salmon, while, the, remainder, are, considered, trout, outside, their, native, habitats, chinook, salmon, have, been, successfully, introduced, in, new, zealand, and, patagonia, while, coho, sockeye, and, atlantic, salmon, have, been, established, in, patagonia, as, well, both, the, salmo, and, oncorhynchus, genera, also, contain, a, number, of, trout, species, informally, referred, to, as, salmon, within, salmo, the, adriatic, salmon, salmo, obtusirostris, and, black, sea, salmon, salmo, labrax, have, both, been, named, as, salmon, in, english, although, they, fall, outside, the, generally, recognized, seven, salmon, species, the, masu, salmon, oncorhynchus, masou, is, actually, considered, a, trout, cherry, trout, in, japan, with, masu, actually, being, the, japanese, word, for, trout, on, the, other, hand, the, steelhead, and, sea, trout, the, anadromous, forms, of, rainbow, trout, and, brown, trout, respectively, are, from, the, same, genera, as, salmon, and, live, identical, migratory, lives, but, neither, is, termed, salmon, the, extinct, eosalmo, driftwoodensis, the, oldest, known, salmoninae, fish, in, the, fossil, record, helps, scientists, figure, how, the, different, species, of, salmon, diverged, from, a, common, ancestor, the, eocene, salmon, s, fossil, from, british, columbia, provides, evidence, that, the, divergence, between, pacific, and, atlantic, salmon, had, not, yet, occurred, 40, million, years, ago, both, the, fossil, record, and, analysis, of, mitochondrial, dna, suggest, the, divergence, occurred, 10, to, 20, million, years, ago, during, the, miocene, this, independent, evidence, from, dna, analysis, and, the, fossil, record, indicate, that, salmon, divergence, occurred, long, before, the, quaternary, glaciation, began, the, cycle, of, glacial, advance, and, retreat, there, are, several, other, species, of, fish, which, are, colloquially, called, salmon, but, are, not, true, salmon, of, those, listed, below, the, danube, salmon, or, huchen, is, a, large, freshwater, salmonid, closely, related, from, the, same, subfamily, to, the, seven, species, of, salmon, above, but, others, are, fishes, of, unrelated, orders, given, the, common, name, salmon, simply, due, to, similar, shapes, behaviors, and, niches, occupied, salmon, eggs, are, laid, in, freshwater, streams, typically, at, high, latitudes, the, eggs, hatch, into, alevin, or, sac, fry, the, fry, quickly, develop, into, parr, with, camouflaging, vertical, stripes, the, parr, stay, for, six, months, to, three, years, in, their, natal, stream, before, becoming, smolts, which, are, distinguished, by, their, bright, silvery, colour, with, scales, that, are, easily, rubbed, off, only, 10, of, all, salmon, eggs, are, estimated, to, survive, to, this, stage, the, smolt, body, chemistry, changes, allowing, them, to, live, in, salt, water, while, a, few, species, of, salmon, remain, in, fresh, water, throughout, their, life, cycle, the, majority, are, anadromous, and, migrate, to, the, ocean, for, maturation, in, these, species, smolts, spend, a, portion, of, their, out, migration, time, in, brackish, water, where, their, body, chemistry, becomes, accustomed, to, osmoregulation, in, the, ocean, this, body, chemistry, change, is, hormone, driven, causing, physiological, adjustments, in, the, function, of, osmoregulatory, organs, such, as, the, gills, which, leads, to, large, increases, in, their, ability, to, secrete, salt, hormones, involved, in, increasing, salinity, tolerance, include, insulin, like, growth, factor, i, cortisol, and, thyroid, hormones, which, permits, the, fish, to, endure, the, transition, from, a, freshwater, environment, to, the, ocean, the, salmon, spend, about, one, to, five, years, depending, on, the, species, in, the, open, ocean, where, they, gradually, become, sexually, mature, the, adult, salmon, then, return, primarily, to, their, natal, streams, to, spawn, atlantic, salmon, spend, between, one, and, four, years, at, sea, when, a, fish, returns, after, just, one, year, s, sea, feeding, it, is, called, a, grilse, in, canada, britain, and, ireland, grilse, may, be, present, at, spawning, and, go, unnoticed, by, large, males, releasing, their, own, sperm, on, the, eggs, prior, to, spawning, depending, on, the, species, salmon, undergo, changes, they, may, grow, a, hump, develop, canine, like, teeth, or, develop, a, kype, a, pronounced, curvature, of, the, jaws, in, male, salmon, all, change, from, the, silvery, blue, of, a, fresh, run, fish, from, the, sea, to, a, darker, colour, salmon, can, make, amazing, journeys, sometimes, moving, hundreds, of, miles, upstream, against, strong, currents, and, rapids, to, reproduce, chinook, and, sockeye, salmon, from, central, idaho, for, example, travel, over, 1, 400, km, 900, mi, and, climb, nearly, 2, 100, m, 7, 000, ft, from, the, pacific, ocean, as, they, return, to, spawn, condition, tends, to, deteriorate, the, longer, the, fish, remain, in, fresh, water, and, they, then, deteriorate, further, after, they, spawn, when, they, are, known, as, kelts, in, all, species, of, pacific, salmon, the, mature, individuals, die, within, a, few, days, or, weeks, of, spawning, a, trait, known, as, semelparity, between, 2, and, 4, of, atlantic, salmon, kelts, survive, to, spawn, again, all, females, however, even, in, those, species, of, salmon, that, may, survive, to, spawn, more, than, once, iteroparity, postspawning, mortality, is, quite, high, perhaps, as, high, as, 40, to, 50, to, lay, her, roe, the, female, salmon, uses, her, tail, caudal, fin, to, create, a, low, pressure, zone, lifting, gravel, to, be, swept, downstream, excavating, a, shallow, depression, called, a, redd, the, redd, may, sometimes, contain, 5, 000, eggs, covering, 2, 8, m, 2, 30, sq, ft, the, eggs, usually, range, from, orange, to, red, one, or, more, males, approach, the, female, in, her, redd, depositing, sperm, or, milt, over, the, roe, the, female, then, covers, the, eggs, by, disturbing, the, gravel, at, the, upstream, edge, of, the, depression, before, moving, on, to, make, another, redd, the, female, may, make, as, many, as, seven, redds, before, her, supply, of, eggs, is, exhausted, each, year, the, fish, experiences, a, period, of, rapid, growth, often, in, summer, and, one, of, slower, growth, normally, in, winter, this, results, in, ring, formation, around, an, earbone, called, the, otolith, annuli, analogous, to, the, growth, rings, visible, in, a, tree, trunk, freshwater, growth, shows, as, densely, crowded, rings, sea, growth, as, widely, spaced, rings, spawning, is, marked, by, significant, erosion, as, body, mass, is, converted, into, eggs, and, milt, freshwater, streams, and, estuaries, provide, important, habitat, for, many, salmon, species, they, feed, on, terrestrial, and, aquatic, insects, amphipods, and, other, crustaceans, while, young, and, primarily, on, other, fish, when, older, eggs, are, laid, in, deeper, water, with, larger, gravel, and, need, cool, water, and, good, water, flow, to, supply, oxygen, to, the, developing, embryos, mortality, of, salmon, in, the, early, life, stages, is, usually, high, due, to, natural, predation, and, human, induced, changes, in, habitat, such, as, siltation, high, water, temperatures, low, oxygen, concentration, loss, of, stream, cover, and, reductions, in, river, flow, estuaries, and, their, associated, wetlands, provide, vital, nursery, areas, for, the, salmon, prior, to, their, departure, to, the, open, ocean, wetlands, not, only, help, buffer, the, estuary, from, silt, and, pollutants, but, also, provide, important, feeding, and, hiding, areas, salmon, not, killed, by, other, means, show, greatly, accelerated, deterioration, phenoptosis, or, programmed, aging, at, the, end, of, their, lives, their, bodies, rapidly, deteriorate, right, after, they, spawn, as, a, result, of, the, release, of, massive, amounts, of, corticosteroids, salmon, are, mid, level, carnivores, whose, diet, change, according, to, their, life, stage, salmon, fry, predominantly, feed, upon, zooplanktons, until, they, reach, fingerling, sizes, when, they, start, to, consume, more, aquatic, invertebrates, such, as, insect, larvae, micro, crustaceans, and, worms, as, juveniles, parrs, they, become, more, predatory, and, actively, prey, upon, aquatic, insects, small, crustaceans, tadpoles, and, small, bait, fishes, they, are, also, known, to, breach, the, water, to, attack, terrestrial, insects, such, as, grasshoppers, and, dragonflies, as, well, as, consuming, fish, eggs, even, those, of, other, salmon, as, adults, salmon, behave, like, other, mid, sized, pelagic, fish, eating, a, variety, of, sea, creatures, including, smaller, forage, fish, such, as, lanternfish, herrings, sand, lances, mackerels, and, barracudina, they, also, eat, krill, squid, and, polychaete, worms, in, the, pacific, northwest, and, alaska, salmon, are, keystone, species, the, migration, of, salmon, represent, a, massive, retrograde, nutrient, transfer, rich, in, nitrogen, sulfur, carbon, and, phosphorus, from, the, ocean, to, the, inland, freshwater, ecosystems, predation, by, piscivorous, land, animals, such, as, ospreys, bears, and, otters, along, the, journey, serve, to, transfer, the, nutrients, from, the, water, to, land, and, decomposition, of, salmon, carcass, benefits, the, forest, ecosystem, in, the, case, of, pacific, salmon, most, if, not, all, of, the, salmon, that, survive, to, reach, the, headwater, spawning, grounds, will, die, after, laying, eggs, and, their, dead, bodies, sink, to, cover, the, gravel, beds, with, the, nutrients, released, from, the, biodegradation, of, their, corpses, providing, a, significant, boost, to, these, otherwise, biomass, poor, shallow, streams, grizzly, bears, function, as, ecosystem, engineers, capturing, salmon, and, carrying, them, into, adjacent, dry, land, to, eat, the, fish, there, they, deposit, nutrient, rich, urine, and, feces, and, partially, eaten, carcasses, bears, preparing, for, hibernation, tend, to, preferentially, consume, the, more, nutrient, and, energy, rich, salmon, roes, and, brain, over, the, actual, flesh, and, are, estimated, to, discard, up, to, half, the, salmon, they, ve, harvested, uneaten, on, the, forest, floor, in, densities, that, can, reach, 4, 000, kg, 8, 800, lb, per, hectare, providing, as, much, as, 24, of, the, total, nitrogen, available, to, the, riparian, woodlands, the, foliage, of, spruce, trees, up, to, 500, m, 1, 600, ft, from, a, stream, where, grizzlies, fish, salmon, have, been, found, to, contain, nitrogen, originating, from, the, fished, salmon, beavers, also, function, as, ecosystem, engineers, in, the, process, of, tree, cutting, and, damming, beavers, alter, the, local, ecosystems, extensively, beaver, ponds, can, provide, critical, habitat, for, juvenile, salmon, an, example, of, this, was, seen, in, the, years, following, 1818, in, the, columbia, river, basin, in, 1818, the, british, government, made, an, agreement, with, the, u, s, government, to, allow, u, s, citizens, access, to, the, columbia, catchment, see, treaty, of, 1818, at, the, time, the, hudson, s, bay, company, sent, word, to, trappers, to, extirpate, all, furbearers, from, the, area, in, an, effort, to, make, the, area, less, attractive, to, u, s, fur, traders, in, response, to, the, elimination, of, beavers, from, large, parts, of, the, river, system, salmon, runs, plummeted, even, in, the, absence, of, many, of, the, factors, usually, associated, with, the, demise, of, salmon, runs, salmon, recruitment, can, be, affected, by, beavers, dams, because, dams, can, beaver, dams, are, able, to, nurture, salmon, juveniles, in, estuarine, tidal, marshes, where, the, salinity, is, less, than, 10, ppm, beavers, build, small, dams, of, generally, less, than, 60, cm, 2, ft, high, in, channels, in, the, myrtle, zone, these, dams, can, be, overtopped, at, high, tide, and, hold, water, at, low, tide, this, provides, refuges, for, juvenile, salmon, so, they, do, not, have, to, swim, into, large, channels, where, they, are, subject, to, predation, by, larger, fish, it, has, been, discovered, that, rivers, which, have, seen, a, decline, or, disappearance, of, anadromous, lampreys, loss, of, the, lampreys, also, affects, the, salmon, in, a, negative, way, like, salmon, anadromous, lampreys, stop, feeding, and, die, after, spawning, and, their, decomposing, bodies, release, nutrients, into, the, stream, also, along, with, species, like, rainbow, trout, and, sacramento, sucker, lampreys, clean, the, gravel, in, the, rivers, during, spawning, their, larvae, called, ammocoetes, are, filter, feeders, which, contribute, to, the, health, of, the, waters, they, are, also, a, food, source, for, the, young, salmon, and, being, fattier, and, oilier, it, is, assumed, predators, prefer, them, over, salmon, offspring, taking, off, some, of, the, predation, pressure, on, smolts, adult, lampreys, are, also, the, preferred, prey, of, seals, and, sea, lions, which, can, eat, 30, lampreys, to, every, salmon, allowing, more, adult, salmon, to, enter, the, rivers, to, spawn, without, being, eaten, by, the, marine, mammals, according, to, canadian, biologist, dorothy, kieser, the, myxozoan, parasite, henneguya, salminicola, is, commonly, found, in, the, flesh, of, salmonids, it, has, been, recorded, in, the, field, samples, of, salmon, returning, to, the, haida, gwaii, islands, the, fish, responds, by, walling, off, the, parasitic, infection, into, a, number, of, cysts, that, contain, milky, fluid, this, fluid, is, an, accumulation, of, a, large, number, of, parasites, henneguya, and, other, parasites, in, the, myxosporean, group, have, complex, life, cycles, where, the, salmon, is, one, of, two, hosts, the, fish, releases, the, spores, after, spawning, in, the, henneguya, case, the, spores, enter, a, second, host, most, likely, an, invertebrate, in, the, spawning, stream, when, juvenile, salmon, migrate, to, the, pacific, ocean, the, second, host, releases, a, stage, infective, to, salmon, the, parasite, is, then, carried, in, the, salmon, until, the, next, spawning, cycle, the, myxosporean, parasite, that, causes, whirling, disease, in, trout, has, a, similar, life, cycle, however, as, opposed, to, whirling, disease, the, henneguya, infestation, does, not, appear, to, cause, disease, in, the, host, salmon, even, heavily, infected, fish, tend, to, return, to, spawn, successfully, according, to, dr, kieser, a, lot, of, work, on, henneguya, salminicola, was, done, by, scientists, at, the, pacific, biological, station, in, nanaimo, in, the, mid, 1980s, in, particular, an, overview, report, which, states, the, fish, that, have, the, longest, fresh, water, residence, time, as, juveniles, have, the, most, noticeable, infections, hence, in, order, of, prevalence, coho, are, most, infected, followed, by, sockeye, chinook, chum, and, pink, as, well, the, report, says, at, the, time, the, studies, were, conducted, stocks, from, the, middle, and, upper, reaches, of, large, river, systems, in, british, columbia, such, as, fraser, skeena, nass, and, from, mainland, coastal, streams, in, the, southern, half, of, b, c, are, more, likely, to, have, a, low, prevalence, of, infection, the, report, also, states, it, should, be, stressed, that, henneguya, economically, deleterious, though, it, is, is, harmless, from, the, view, of, public, health, it, is, strictly, a, fish, parasite, that, cannot, live, in, or, affect, warm, blooded, animals, including, man, according, to, klaus, schallie, molluscan, shellfish, program, specialist, with, the, canadian, food, inspection, agency, henneguya, salminicola, is, found, in, southern, b, c, also, and, in, all, species, of, salmon, i, have, previously, examined, smoked, chum, salmon, sides, that, were, riddled, with, cysts, and, some, sockeye, runs, in, barkley, sound, southern, b, c, west, coast, of, vancouver, island, are, noted, for, their, high, incidence, of, infestation, sea, lice, particularly, lepeophtheirus, salmonis, and, various, caligus, species, including, c, clemensi, and, c, rogercresseyi, can, cause, deadly, infestations, of, both, farm, grown, and, wild, salmon, sea, lice, are, ectoparasites, which, feed, on, mucus, blood, and, skin, and, migrate, and, latch, onto, the, skin, of, wild, salmon, during, free, swimming, planktonic, nauplii, and, copepodid, larval, stages, which, can, persist, for, several, days, large, numbers, of, highly, populated, open, net, salmon, farms, can, create, exceptionally, large, concentrations, of, sea, lice, when, exposed, in, river, estuaries, containing, large, numbers, of, open, net, farms, many, young, wild, salmon, are, infected, and, do, not, survive, as, a, result, adult, salmon, may, survive, otherwise, critical, numbers, of, sea, lice, but, small, thin, skinned, juvenile, salmon, migrating, to, sea, are, highly, vulnerable, on, the, pacific, coast, of, canada, the, louse, induced, mortality, of, pink, salmon, in, some, regions, is, commonly, over, 80, the, risk, of, injury, caused, by, underwater, pile, driving, has, been, studied, by, dr, halvorsen, and, her, co, workers, the, study, concluded, that, the, fish, are, at, risk, of, injury, if, the, cumulative, sound, exposure, level, exceeds, 210, db, relative, to, 1, pa, 2, s, as, can, be, seen, from, the, production, chart, at, the, left, the, global, capture, reported, by, different, countries, to, the, fao, of, commercial, wild, salmon, has, remained, fairly, steady, since, 1990, at, about, one, million, tonnes, per, year, this, is, in, contrast, to, farmed, salmon, below, which, has, increased, in, the, same, period, from, about, 0, 6, million, tonnes, to, well, over, two, million, tonnes, nearly, all, captured, wild, salmon, are, pacific, salmon, the, capture, of, wild, atlantic, salmon, has, always, been, relatively, small, and, has, declined, steadily, since, 1990, in, 2011, only, 2, 500, tonnes, were, reported, in, contrast, about, half, of, all, farmed, salmon, are, atlantic, salmon, recreational, salmon, fishing, can, be, a, technically, demanding, kind, of, sport, fishing, not, necessarily, intuitive, for, beginning, fishermen, a, conflict, exists, between, commercial, fishermen, and, recreational, fishermen, for, the, right, to, salmon, stock, resources, commercial, fishing, in, estuaries, and, coastal, areas, is, often, restricted, so, enough, salmon, can, return, to, their, natal, rivers, where, they, can, spawn, and, be, available, for, sport, fishing, on, parts, of, the, north, american, west, coast, salmon, sport, fishing, has, completely, replaced, inshore, commercial, salmon, fishing, in, most, cases, the, commercial, value, of, a, salmon, sold, as, seafood, can, be, several, times, less, than, the, value, attributed, to, the, same, fish, caught, by, a, sport, fisherman, this, is, a, powerful, economic, argument, for, allocating, stock, resources, preferentially, to, sport, fishing, salmon, aquaculture, is, a, major, contributor, to, the, world, production, of, farmed, finfish, representing, about, us, 10, billion, annually, other, commonly, cultured, fish, species, include, tilapia, catfish, sea, bass, carp, and, bream, salmon, farming, is, significant, in, chile, norway, scotland, canada, and, the, faroe, islands, it, is, the, source, for, most, salmon, consumed, in, the, united, states, and, europe, atlantic, salmon, are, also, in, very, small, volumes, farmed, in, russia, and, tasmania, australia, salmon, are, carnivorous, and, need, to, be, fed, meals, produced, from, catching, other, wild, forage, fish, and, other, marine, organisms, salmon, farming, leads, to, a, high, demand, for, wild, forage, fish, as, a, predator, salmon, require, large, nutritional, intakes, of, protein, and, farmed, salmon, consume, more, fish, than, they, generate, as, a, final, product, on, a, dry, weight, basis, 2, 4, kg, of, wild, caught, fish, are, needed, to, produce, one, kilogram, of, salmon, as, the, salmon, farming, industry, expands, it, requires, more, forage, fish, for, feed, at, a, time, when, 75, of, the, world, s, monitored, fisheries, are, already, near, to, or, have, exceeded, their, maximum, sustainable, yield, the, industrial, scale, extraction, of, wild, forage, fish, for, salmon, farming, affects, the, survivability, of, other, wild, predatory, fish, which, rely, on, them, for, food, research, is, ongoing, into, sustainable, and, plant, based, salmon, feeds, intensive, salmon, farming, uses, open, net, cages, which, have, low, production, costs, it, has, the, drawback, of, allowing, disease, and, sea, lice, to, spread, to, local, wild, salmon, stocks, another, form, of, salmon, production, which, is, safer, but, less, controllable, is, to, raise, salmon, in, hatcheries, until, they, are, old, enough, to, become, independent, they, are, released, into, rivers, in, an, attempt, to, increase, the, salmon, population, this, system, is, referred, to, as, ranching, it, was, very, common, in, countries, such, as, sweden, before, the, norwegians, developed, salmon, farming, but, is, seldom, done, by, private, companies, as, anyone, may, catch, the, salmon, when, they, return, to, spawn, a, company, is, limited, in, benefiting, financially, from, their, investment, because, of, this, the, ranching, method, has, mainly, been, used, by, various, public, authorities, and, non, profit, groups, such, as, the, cook, inlet, aquaculture, association, as, a, way, to, increase, salmon, populations, in, situations, where, they, have, declined, due, to, overharvesting, construction, of, dams, and, habitat, destruction, or, fragmentation, negative, consequences, to, this, sort, of, population, manipulation, include, genetic, dilution, of, the, wild, stocks, many, jurisdictions, are, now, beginning, to, discourage, supplemental, fish, planting, in, favour, of, harvest, controls, and, habitat, improvement, and, protection, a, variant, method, of, fish, stocking, called, ocean, ranching, is, under, development, in, alaska, there, the, young, salmon, are, released, into, the, ocean, far, from, any, wild, salmon, streams, when, it, is, time, for, them, to, spawn, they, return, to, where, they, were, released, where, fishermen, can, catch, them, an, alternative, method, to, hatcheries, is, to, use, spawning, channels, these, are, artificial, streams, usually, parallel, to, an, existing, stream, with, concrete, or, rip, rap, sides, and, gravel, bottoms, water, from, the, adjacent, stream, is, piped, into, the, top, of, the, channel, sometimes, via, a, header, pond, to,

redds, because, of, the, lack, of, floods, spawning, channels, must, sometimes, be, cleaned, out, to, remove, accumulated, sediment, the, same, floods, that, destroy, natural, redds, also, clean, the,

farm, raised, salmon, are, fed, the, carotenoids, astaxanthin, and, canthaxanthin, to, match, their, flesh, colour, to, wild, salmon, to, improve, their, marketability, wild, salmon, get, these, carotenoids, primarily, astaxanthin, from, eating, shellfish, and, krill, one, proposed, alternative, to, the, use, of, wild, caught, fish, as, feed, for, the, salmon, is, the, use, of, soy, based, products, this, should, be, better, for, the, local, environment, of, the, fish, farm, but, producing, soy, beans, has, a, high, environmental, cost, for, the, producing, region, the, fish, omega, 3, fatty, acid, content, would, be, reduced, compared, to, fish, fed, salmon, another, possible, alternative, is, a, yeast, based, coproduct, of, bioethanol, production, proteinaceous, fermentation, biomass, substituting, such, products, for, engineered, feed, can, result, in, equal, sometimes, enhanced, growth, in, fish, with, its, increasing, availability, this, would, address, the, problems, of, rising, costs, for, buying, hatchery, fish, feed, yet, another, attractive, alternative, is, the, increased, use, of, seaweed, seaweed, provides, essential, minerals, and, vitamins, for, growing, organisms, it, offers, the, advantage, of, providing, natural, amounts, of, dietary, fiber, and, having, a, lower, glycemic, load, than, grain, based, fish, meal, in, the, best, case, scenario, widespread, use, of, seaweed, could, yield, a, future, in, aquaculture, that, eliminates, the, need, for, land, freshwater, or, fertilizer, to, raise, fish, salmon, population, levels, are, of, concern, in, the, atlantic, and, in, some, parts, of, the, pacific, the, population, of, wild, salmon, declined, markedly, in, recent, decades, especially, north, atlantic, populations, which, spawn,

salmon, may, contain, high, levels, of, dioxins, pcb, polychlorinated, biphenyl, levels, may, be, up, to, eight, times, higher, in, farmed, salmon, than, in, wild, salmon, but, still, well, below, levels, considered, dangerous, nonetheless, according, to, a, 2006, study, published, in, the, journal, of, the, american, medical, association, the, benefits, of, eating, even, farmed, salmon, still, outweigh, any, risks, imposed, by, contaminants, farmed, salmon, has, a, high, omega, 3, fatty, acid, content, comparable, to, wild, salmon, the, type, of, omega, 3, present, may, not, be, a, factor, for, other, important, health, functions, salmon, flesh, is, generally, orange, to, red, although, white, fleshed, wild, salmon, with, white, black, skin, colour, occurs, the, natural, colour, of, salmon, results, from, carotenoid, pigments, largely, astaxanthin, but, also, canthaxanthin, in, the, flesh, wild, salmon, get, these, carotenoids, from, eating, krill, and, other, tiny, shellfish, the, vast, majority, of, atlantic, salmon, available, in, market, around, the, world, are, farmed, almost, 99, whereas, the, majority, of, pacific, salmon, are, wild, caught, greater, than, 80,

sashimi, raw, fish, and, sushi, to, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, pacific, northwest, coast, salmon, is, considered, a, vital, part, of, the, diet, specifically, the, indigenous, peoples, of, haida, gwaii, located, near, former, queen, charlotte, island, in, british, columbia, rely, on, salmon, as, one, of, their, main, sources, of, food, although, many, other, bands, have, fished, pacific, waters, for, centuries, salmon, are, not, only, ancient, and, unique, but, it, is, important, because, it, is, expressed, in, culture, art, forms, and, ceremonial, feasts, annually, salmon, spawn, in, haida, feeding, on, everything, on, the, way, upstream, and, down, within, the, haida, nation, salmon, is, referred, to, as, tsiin, and, is, prepared, in, several, ways, including, smoking, baking, frying, and, making, soup, historically, there, has, always, been, enough, salmon, as, traditional, subsistence, fishing, methods, did, not, result, in, overfishing, and, people, only, took, what, they, needed, in, 2003, a, report, on, first, nations, participation, in, commercial, fisheries, including, salmon, commissioned, by, bc, s, ministry, of, agriculture, and, food, found, that, there, were, 595, first, nation, owned, and, operated, commercial, vessels, in, the, province, of, those, vessels, first, nations, members, owned, 564, however, employment, within, the, industry, has, decreased, overall, by, 50, in, the, last, decade, with, 8, 142, registered, commercial, fishermen, in, 2003, this, has, affected, employment, for, many, fisherman, who, rely, on, salmon, as, a, source, of, income, black, bears, also, rely, on, salmon, as, food, the, leftovers, the, bears, leave, behind, are, considered, important, nutrients, for, the, canadian, forest, such, as, the, soil, trees, and, plants, in, this, sense, the, salmon, feed, the, forest, and, in, return, receive, clean, water, and, gravel, in, which, to, hatch, and, grow, sheltered, from, extremes, of, temperature, and, water, flow, in, times, of, high, and, low, rainfall, however, the, condition, of, the, salmon, in, haida, has, been, affected, in, recent, decades, due, to, logging, and, development, much, of, the, salmon, s, habitat, i, e, ain, river, has, been, destroyed, resulting, in, the, fish, being, close, to, endangered, for, residents, this, has, resulted, in, limits, on, catches, in, turn, has, affected, families, diets, and, cultural, events, such, as, feasts, some, of, the, salmon, systems, in, danger, include, the, davidon, naden, mamim, and, mathers, it, is, clear, that, further, protection, is, needed, for, salmon, such, as, their, habitats, where, logging, commonly, occurs, the, salmon, has, long, been, at, the, heart, of, the, culture, and, livelihood, of, coastal, dwellers, which, can, be, traced, as, far, back, as, 5, 000, years, when, archeologists, discovered, nisqually, tribe, remnants, the, original, distribution, of, the, genus, oncorhynchus, covered, the, pacific, rim, coastline, history, shows, salmon, used, tributaries, rivers, and, estuaries, without, regard, to, jurisdiction, for, 18, 22, million, years, baseline, data, is, near, impossible, to, recreate, based, on, the, inconsistent, historical, data, but, there, has, been, massive, depletion, since, the, 1900s, the, pacific, northwest, once, sprawled, with, native, inhabitants, who, ensured, little, degradation, was, caused, by, their, actions, to, salmon, habitats, as, animists, the, indigenous, people, relied, not, only, for, salmon, for, food, but, spiritual, guidance, the, role, of, the, salmon, spirit, guided, the, people, to, respect, ecological, systems, such, as, the, rivers, and, tributaries, the, salmon, used, for, spawning, natives, often, used, the, entire, fish, and, left, little, waste, by, turning, the, bladder, into, glue, and, using, bones, for, toys, and, skin, for, clothing, and, shoes, the, original, salmon, ceremony, introduced, by, indigenous, tribes, on, the, pacific, coast, consisted, of, three, major, parts, first, was, the, welcoming, of, the, first, catch, and, then, the, cooking, of, it, finally, the, bones, were, returned, to, the, sea, to, induce, hospitality, so, other, salmon, would, give, their, lives, to, the, people, of, that, village, many, tribes, such, as, the, yurok, had, a, taboo, against, harvesting, the, first, fish, that, swam, upriver, in, summer, but, once, they, confirmed, that, the, salmon, run, had, returned, in, abundance, they, would, begin, to, catch, them, in, plentiful, the, indigenous, practices, were, guided, by, deep, ecological, wisdom, which, was, eradicated, when, euro, american, settlements, began, to, be, developed, salmon, have, a, much, grander, history, than, what, is, presently, shown, today, the, salmon, that, once, dominated, the, pacific, ocean, are, now, just, a, fraction, in, population, and, size, the, pacific, salmon, population, is, now, less, than, 1, 3, of, what, it, was, when, lewis, and, clark, arrived, at, the, region, in, his, 1908, state, of, the, union, address, u, s, president, theodore, roosevelt, observed, that, the, fisheries, were, in, significant, decline, the, salmon, fisheries, of, the, columbia, river, are, now, but, a, fraction, of, what, they, were, twenty, five, years, ago, and, what, they, would, be, now, if, the, united, states, government, had, taken, complete, charge, of, them, by, intervening, between, oregon, and, washington, during, these, twenty, five, years, the, fishermen, of, each, state, have, naturally, tried, to, take, all, they, could, get, and, the, two, legislatures, have, never, been, able, to, agree, on, joint, action, of, any, kind, adequate, in, degree, for, the, protection, of, the, fisheries, at, the, moment, the, fishing, on, the, oregon, side, is, practically, closed, while, there, is, no, limit, on, the, washington, side, of, any, kind, and, no, one, can, tell, what, the, courts, will, decide, as, to, the, very, statutes, under, which, this, action, and, non, action, result, meanwhile, very, few, salmon, reach, the, spawning, grounds, and, probably, four, years, hence, the, fisheries, will, amount, to, nothing, and, this, comes, from, a, struggle, between, the, associated, or, gill, net, fishermen, on, the, one, hand, and, the, owners, of, the, fishing, wheels, up, the, river, on, the, columbia, river, the, chief, joseph, dam, completed, in, 1955, completely, blocks, salmon, migration, to, the, upper, columbia, river, system, the, fraser, river, salmon, population, was, affected, by, the, 1914, slide, caused, by, the, canadian, pacific, railway, at, hells, gate, the, 1917, catch, was, one, quarter, of, the, 1913, catch, the, origin, of, the, word, for, salmon, was, one, of, the, arguments, about, the, location, of, the, origin, of, the, indo, european, languages, the, salmon, is, an, important, creature, in, several, strands, of, celtic, mythology, and, poetry, which, often, associated, them, with, wisdom, and, venerability, in, irish, folklore, fishermen, associated, salmon, with, fairies, and, thought, it, was, unlucky, to, refer, to, them, by, name, in, irish, mythology, a, creature, called, the, salmon, of, knowledge, plays, key, role, in, the, tale, the, boyhood, deeds, of, fionn, in, the, tale, the, salmon, will, grant, powers, of, knowledge, to, whoever, eats, it, and, is, sought, by, poet, finn, eces, for, seven, years, finally, finn, eces, catches, the, fish, and, gives, it, to, his, young, pupil, fionn, mac, cumhaill, to, prepare, it, for, him, however, fionn, burns, his, thumb, on, the, salmon, s, juices, and, he, instinctively, puts, it, in, his, mouth, in, so, doing, he, inadvertently, gains, the, salmon, s, wisdom, elsewhere, in, irish, mythology, the, salmon, is, also, one, of, the, incarnations, of, both, tuan, mac, cairill, and, fintan, mac, b, chra, salmon, also, feature, in, welsh, mythology, in, the, prose, tale, culhwch, and, olwen, the, salmon, of, llyn, llyw, is, the, oldest, animal, in, britain, and, the, only, creature, who, knows, the, location, of, mabon, ap, modron, after, speaking, to, a, string, of, other, ancient, animals, who, do, not, know, his, whereabouts, king, arthur, s, men, cai, and, bedwyr, are, led, to, the, salmon, of, llyn, llyw, who, lets, them, ride, its, back, to, the, walls, of, mabon, s, prison, in, gloucester, in, norse, mythology, after, loki, tricked, the, blind, god, h, r, into, killing, his, brother, baldr, loki, jumped, into, a, river, and, transformed, himself, into, a, salmon, to, escape, punishment, from, the, other, gods, when, they, held, out, a, net, to, trap, him, he, attempted, to, leap, over, it, but, was, caught, by, thor, who, grabbed, him, by, the, tail, with, his, hand, and, this, is, why, the, salmon, s, tail, is, tapered, salmon, are, central, spiritually, and, culturally, to, native, american, mythology, on, the, pacific, coast, from, the,
