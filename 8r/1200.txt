slime, mold, or, slime, mould, is, an, informal, name, given, to, a, polyphyletic, assemblage, of, unrelated, eukaryotic, organisms, in, the, stramenopiles, rhizaria, discoba, amoebozoa, and, holomycota, clades, most, are, microscopic, those, in, the, myxogastria, form, larger, plasmodial, slime, molds, visible, to, the, naked, eye, the, slime, mold, life, cycle, includes, a, free, living, single, celled, stage, and, the, formation, of, spores, spores, are, often, produced, in, macroscopic, multicellular, or, multinucleate, fruiting, bodies, that, may, be, formed, through, aggregation, or, fusion, aggregation, is, driven, by, chemical, signals, called, acrasins, slime, molds, contribute, to, the, decomposition, of, dead, vegetation, some, are, parasitic, most, slime, molds, are, terrestrial, and, free, living, typically, in, damp, shady, habitats, such, as, in, or, on, the, surface, of, rotting, wood, some, myxogastrians, and, protostelians, are, aquatic, or, semi, aquatic, the, phytomyxea, are, parasitic, living, inside, their, plant, hosts, geographically, slime, molds, are, cosmopolitan, in, distribution, a, small, number, of, species, occur, in, regions, as, dry, as, the, atacama, desert, and, as, cold, as, the, arctic, they, are, abundant, in, the, tropics, especially, in, rainforests, slime, molds, have, a, variety, of, behaviors, otherwise, seen, in, animals, with, brains, species, such, as, physarum, polycephalum, have, been, used, to, simulate, traffic, networks, some, species, have, traditionally, been, eaten, in, countries, such, as, ecuador, the, first, account, of, slime, molds, was, thomas, panckow, s, 1654, discussion, of, lycogala, epidendrum, he, called, it, fungus, cito, crescentes, a, fast, growing, fungus, german, mycologist, heinrich, anton, de, bary, in, 1860, and, 1887, classified, the, myxomycetes, plasmodial, slime, molds, and, acrasieae, cellular, slime, molds, as, mycetozoa, a, new, class, he, also, introduced, a, doubtful, mycetozoa, section, for, plasmodiophora, now, in, phytomyxea, and, labyrinthula, emphasizing, their, distinction, from, plants, and, fungi, in, 1880, the, french, botanist, philippe, van, tieghem, analyzed, the, two, groups, further, in, 1868, the, german, biologist, ernst, haeckel, placed, the, mycetozoa, in, a, kingdom, he, named, protista, in, 1885, the, british, zoologist, ray, lankester, grouped, the, mycetozoa, alongside, the, proteomyxa, as, part, of, the, gymnomyxa, in, the, phylum, protozoa, arthur, and, gulielma, lister, published, monographs, of, the, group, in, 1894, 1911, and, 1925, in, 1932, and, 1960, the, american, mycologist, george, willard, martin, argued, that, the, slime, molds, evolved, from, fungi, in, 1956, the, american, biologist, herbert, copeland, placed, the, mycetozoa, the, myxomycetes, and, plasmodiophorids, and, the, sarkodina, the, labyrinthulids, and, the, cellular, slime, molds, in, a, phylum, called, protoplasta, which, he, placed, alongside, the, fungi, and, the, algae, in, a, new, kingdom, protoctista, in, 1969, the, taxonomist, r, h, whittaker, observed, that, slime, molds, were, highly, conspicuous, and, distinct, within, the, fungi, the, group, to, which, they, were, then, classified, he, concurred, with, lindsay, s, olive, s, proposal, to, reclassify, the, gymnomycota, which, includes, slime, molds, as, part, of, the, protista, whittaker, placed, three, phyla, namely, the, myxomycota, acrasiomycota, and, labyrinthulomycota, in, a, subkingdom, gymnomycota, within, the, fungi, the, same, year, martin, and, alexopoulos, published, their, influential, textbook, the, myxomycetes, in, 1975, olive, distinguished, the, dictyostelids, and, the, acrasids, as, separate, groups, in, 1992, david, j, patterson, and, m, l, sogin, proposed, that, the, dictyostelids, diverged, before, plants, animals, and, fungi, slime, molds, have, little, or, no, fossil, history, as, might, be, expected, given, that, they, are, small, and, soft, bodied, the, grouping, is, polyphyletic, consisting, of, multiple, clades, emphasised, in, the, phylogenetic, tree, widely, scattered, across, the, eukaryotes, paraphyletic, groups, are, shown, in, quotation, marks, plants, labyrinthulomycetes, phytomyxea, euglenae, etc, acrasida, copromyxa, fonticulida, fungi, various, estimates, of, the, number, of, species, of, slime, molds, agree, that, there, are, around, 1000, species, most, being, myxogastria, collection, of, environmental, dna, gives, a, higher, estimate, from, 1200, to, 1500, species, these, are, diverse, both, taxonomically, and, in, appearance, the, largest, and, most, familiar, species, being, among, the, myxogastria, the, growth, forms, most, commonly, noticed, are, the, sporangia, the, spore, forming, bodies, which, are, often, roughly, spherical, these, may, be, directly, on, the, surface, such, as, on, rotting, wood, or, may, be, on, a, thin, stalk, which, elevates, the, spores, for, release, above, the, surface, other, species, have, the, spores, in, a, large, mass, which, may, be, visited, by, insects, for, food, they, disperse, spores, when, they, leave, the, myxogastria, or, plasmodial, slime, molds, are, the, only, macroscopic, scale, slime, molds, they, gave, the, group, its, informal, name, since, for, part, of, their, life, cycle, they, are, slimy, to, the, touch, a, myxogastrian, consists, of, a, large, cell, with, thousands, of, nuclei, within, a, single, membrane, without, walls, forming, a, syncytium, most, are, smaller, than, a, few, centimeters, but, some, species, may, reach, sizes, up, to, several, square, meters, and, in, the, case, of, brefeldia, maxima, a, mass, of, up, to, 20, kilograms, 44, lb, the, dictyosteliida, or, cellular, slime, molds, do, not, form, huge, coenocytes, like, the, myxogastria, their, amoebae, remain, individual, for, most, of, their, lives, as, individual, unicellular, protists, feeding, on, microorganisms, when, food, is, depleted, and, they, are, ready, to, form, sporangia, they, form, swarms, the, amoebae, join, up, into, a, tiny, multicellular, slug, which, crawls, to, an, open, lit, place, and, grows, into, a, fruiting, body, a, sorocarp, some, of, the, amoebae, become, spores, to, begin, the, next, generation, but, others, sacrifice, themselves, to, become, a, dead, stalk, lifting, the, spores, up, into, the, air, the, protosteliida, a, polyphyletic, group, have, characters, intermediate, between, the, previous, two, groups, but, they, are, much, smaller, the, fruiting, bodies, only, forming, one, to, a, few, spores, the, lobosans, a, paraphyletic, group, of, amoebae, include, the, copromyxa, slime, molds, among, the, non, amoebozoan, slime, molds, are, the, acrasids, which, have, sluglike, amoebae, in, locomotion, the, amoebae, s, pseudopodia, are, eruptive, meaning, that, hemispherical, bulges, appear, at, the, front, the, phytomyxea, are, obligate, parasites, with, hosts, among, the, plants, diatoms, oomycetes, and, brown, algae, they, cause, plant, diseases, like, cabbage, club, root, and, powdery, scab, the, labyrinthulomycetes, are, marine, slime, nets, forming, labyrinthine, networks, of, tubes, in, which, amoeba, without, pseudopods, can, travel, the, fonticulida, are, cellular, slime, molds, that, form, a, fruiting, body, in, a, volcano, shape, slime, molds, with, their, small, size, and, moist, surface, live, mostly, in, damp, habitats, including, shaded, forests, rotting, wood, fallen, or, living, leaves, and, on, bryophytes, most, myxogastria, are, terrestrial, though, some, like, didymium, aquatilis, are, aquatic, and, d, nigripes, is, semi, aquatic, myxogastria, are, not, limited, to, wet, regions, 34, species, are, known, from, saudi, arabia, living, on, bark, in, plant, litter, and, rotting, wood, even, in, deserts, they, occur, too, in, arizona, s, sonoran, desert, 46, species, and, in, chile, s, exceptionally, dry, atacama, desert, 24, species, in, contrast, the, semi, dry, tehuac, n, cuicatl, n, biosphere, reserve, has, 105, species, and, russia, and, kazakhstan, s, volga, river, basin, has, 158, species, in, tropical, rainforests, of, latin, america, species, such, as, of, arcyria, and, didymium, are, commonly, epiphyllous, growing, on, the, leaves, of, liverworts, the, dictyostelids, are, mostly, terrestrial, on, changbai, mountain, in, china, six, species, of, dictyostelids, were, found, in, forest, soils, at, elevations, up, to, 2, 038, m, 6, 686, ft, the, highest, recorded, species, there, being, dictyostelium, mucoroides, the, protostelids, live, mainly, on, dead, plant, matter, where, they, consume, the, spores, of, bacteria, yeasts, and, fungi, they, include, some, aquatic, species, which, live, on, dead, plant, parts, submerged, in, ponds, cellular, slime, molds, are, most, numerous, in, the, tropics, decreasing, with, latitude, but, are, cosmopolitan, in, distribution, occurring, in, soil, even, in, the, arctic, and, the, antarctic, in, the, alaskan, tundra, the, only, slime, molds, are, the, dictyostelids, d, mucoroides, and, d, sphaerocephalum, the, species, of, copromyxa, are, coprophilous, feeding, on, dung, some, myxogastrians, have, their, spores, dispersed, by, animals, the, slime, mold, fly, epicypta, testata, lay, its, eggs, within, the, spore, mass, of, enteridium, lycoperdon, which, the, larvae, feed, on, these, pupate, and, the, hatching, adults, carry, and, disperse, spores, that, have, stuck, to, them, while, various, insects, consume, slime, molds, sphindidae, slime, mold, beetles, both, larvae, and, adults, exclusively, feed, on, them, plasmodial, slime, molds, begin, life, as, amoeba, like, cells, these, unicellular, amoebae, are, commonly, haploid, and, feed, on, small, prey, such, as, bacteria, yeast, cells, and, fungal, spores, by, phagocytosis, engulfing, them, with, its, cell, membrane, these, amoebae, can, mate, if, they, encounter, the, correct, mating, type, and, form, zygotes, that, then, grow, into, plasmodia, these, contain, many, nuclei, without, cell, membranes, between, them, and, can, grow, to, meters, in, size, the, species, fuligo, septica, is, often, seen, as, a, slimy, yellow, network, in, and, on, rotting, logs, the, amoebae, and, the, plasmodia, engulf, microorganisms, the, plasmodium, grows, into, an, interconnected, network, of, protoplasmic, strands, within, each, protoplasmic, strand, the, cytoplasmic, contents, rapidly, stream, periodically, reversing, direction, the, streaming, protoplasm, within, a, plasmodial, strand, can, reach, speeds, of, up, to, 1, 35, mm, per, second, in, physarum, polycephalum, the, fastest, for, any, microorganism, slime, molds, are, isogamous, which, means, that, their, gametes, reproductive, cells, are, all, the, same, size, unlike, the, eggs, and, sperms, of, animals, physarum, polycephalum, has, three, genes, involved, in, reproduction, mat, a, and, mat, b, with, thirteen, variants, each, and, mat, c, with, three, variants, each, reproductively, mature, slime, mold, is, diploid, meaning, that, it, contains, two, copies, of, each, of, the, three, reproductive, genes, when, p, polycephalum, is, ready, to, make, its, reproductive, cells, it, grows, a, bulbous, extension, of, its, body, to, contain, them, each, cell, has, a, random, combination, of, the, genes, that, the, slime, mold, contains, within, its, genome, therefore, it, can, create, cells, of, up, to, eight, different, gene, types, released, cells, then, independently, seek, another, compatible, cell, for, fusion, other, individuals, of, p, polycephalum, may, contain, different, combinations, of, the, mat, a, mat, b, and, mat, c, genes, allowing, over, 500, possible, variations, it, is, advantageous, for, organisms, with, this, type, of, reproductive, cell, to, have, many, mating, types, because, the, likelihood, of, the, cells, finding, a, partner, is, greatly, increased, and, the, risk, of, inbreeding, is, drastically, reduced, the, cellular, slime, molds, are, a, group, of, approximately, 150, described, species, they, occur, primarily, in, the, humus, layer, of, forest, soils, and, feed, on, bacteria, but, also, are, found, in, animal, dung, and, agricultural, fields, they, exist, as, single, celled, organisms, while, food, is, plentiful, when, food, is, in, short, supply, many, of, the, single, celled, amoebae, congregate, and, start, moving, as, a, single, body, called, a, slug, the, ability, of, the, single, celled, organisms, to, aggregate, into, multicellular, forms, are, why, they, are, also, called, the, social, amoebae, in, this, state, they, are, sensitive, to, airborne, chemicals, and, can, detect, food, sources, they, readily, change, the, shape, and, function, of, parts, and, may, form, stalks, that, produce, fruiting, bodies, releasing, countless, spores, light, enough, to, be, carried, on, the, wind, or, on, passing, animals, the, cellular, slime, mold, dictyostelium, discoideum, has, many, different, mating, types, when, this, organism, has, entered, the, stage, of, reproduction, it, releases, a, chemical, attractant, when, it, comes, time, for, the, cells, to, fuse, dictyostelium, discoideum, has, mating, types, of, its, own, that, dictate, which, cells, are, compatible, with, each, other, there, are, at, least, eleven, mating, types, macrocysts, form, after, cell, contact, between, compatible, mating, types, the, chemicals, that, aggregate, cellular, slime, molds, are, small, molecules, called, acrasins, motion, towards, a, chemical, signal, is, called, chemotaxis, the, first, acrasin, to, be, discovered, was, cyclic, adenosine, monophosphate, cyclic, amp, a, common, cell, signaling, molecule, in, dictyostelium, discoideum, during, the, aggregation, phase, of, their, life, cycle, dictyostelium, discoideum, amoebae, communicate, with, each, other, using, traveling, waves, of, cyclic, amp, there, is, an, amplification, of, cyclic, amp, when, they, aggregate, pre, stalk, cells, move, toward, cyclic, amp, but, pre, spore, cells, ignore, the, signal, other, acrasins, exist, the, acrasin, for, polysphondylium, violaceum, purified, in, 1983, is, the, dipeptide, glorin, calcium, ions, too, serve, to, attract, slime, mold, amoebae, at, least, at, short, distances, it, has, been, suggested, that, acrasins, may, be, taxon, specific, since, specificity, is, required, to, form, an, aggregation, of, genetically, similar, cells, many, dictyostelid, species, indeed, do, not, respond, to, cyclic, amp, but, as, of, 2023, their, acrasins, remained, unknown, the, practical, study, of, slime, molds, was, facilitated, by, the, introduction, of, the, moist, culture, chamber, by, h, c, gilbert, and, g, w, martin, in, 1933, slime, molds, can, be, used, to, teach, convergent, evolution, as, the, habit, of, forming, a, stalk, with, a, sporangium, that, can, release, spores, into, the, air, off, the, ground, has, evolved, repeatedly, such, as, in, myxogastria, eukaryotes, and, in, myxobacteria, prokaryotes, further, both, the, macroscopic, dictyostelids, and, the, microscopic, protostelids, have, a, phase, with, motile, amoebae, and, a, phase, with, a, stalk, in, the, protostelids, the, stalk, is, tiny, supporting, just, one, spore, but, the, logic, of, airborne, spore, dispersal, is, the, same, o, r, collins, showed, that, the, slime, mold, didymium, iridis, had, two, strains, and, of, cells, equivalent, to, gametes, that, these, could, form, immortal, cell, lines, in, culture, and, that, the, system, was, controlled, by, alleles, of, a, single, gene, this, made, the, species, a, model, organism, for, exploring, incompatibility, asexual, reproduction, and, mating, types, slime, molds, have, been, studied, for, their, production, of, unusual, organic, compounds, including, pigments, antibiotics, and, anti, cancer, drugs, pigments, include, naphthoquinones, physarochrome, a, and, compounds, of, tetramic, acid, bisindolylmaleimides, produced, by, arcyria, denudata, include, some, phosphorescent, compounds, the, sporophores, fruiting, bodies, of, arcyria, denudata, are, colored, red, by, arcyriaflavins, a, c, which, contain, an, unusual, indolo, carbazole, alkaloid, ring, by, 2022, more, than, 100, pigments, had, been, isolated, from, slime, molds, mostly, from, sporophores, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, many, yellow, to, red, pigments, might, be, useful, in, cosmetics, some, 42, of, patients, with, seasonal, allergic, rhinitis, reacted, to, myxogastrian, spores, so, the, spores, may, contribute, significantly, as, airborne, allergens, slime, molds, share, some, similarities, with, neural, systems, in, animals, the, membranes, of, both, slime, molds, and, neural, cells, contain, receptor, sites, which, alter, electrical, properties, of, the, membrane, when, it, is, bound, therefore, some, studies, on, the, early, evolution, of, animal, neural, systems, are, inspired, by, slime, molds, when, a, slime, mold, mass, or, mound, is, physically, separated, the, cells, find, their, way, back, to, re, unite, studies, on, physarum, polycephalum, have, even, shown, the, organism, to, have, an, ability, to, learn, and, predict, periodic, unfavorable, conditions, in, laboratory, experiments, john, tyler, bonner, a, professor, of, ecology, known, for, his, studies, of, slime, molds, argues, that, they, are, no, more, than, a, bag, of, amoebae, encased, in, a, thin, slime, sheath, yet, they, manage, to, have, various, behaviors, that, are, equal, to, those, of, animals, who, possess, muscles, and, nerves, with, ganglia, that, is, simple, brains, the, slime, mold, algorithm, is, a, meta, heuristic, algorithm, based, on, the, behavior, of, aggregated, slime, molds, as, they, stream, in, search, of, food, it, is, described, as, a, simple, efficient, and, flexible, way, of, solving, optimization, problems, such, as, finding, the, shortest, path, between, nodes, in, a, network, however, it, can, become, trapped, in, a, local, optimum, toshiyuki, nakagaki, and, colleagues, studies, slime, molds, and, their, abilities, to, solve, mazes, by, placing, nodes, at, two, point, separated, by, a, maze, of, plastic, film, the, mold, explored, all, possible, paths, and, solves, it, for, the, shortest, path, atsushi, tero, and, colleagues, grew, physarum, in, a, flat, wet, dish, placing, the, mold, in, a, central, position, representing, tokyo, and, oat, flakes, surrounding, it, corresponding, to, the, locations, of, other, major, cities, in, the, greater, tokyo, area, as, physarum, avoids, bright, light, light, was, used, to, simulate, mountains, water, and, other, obstacles, in, the, dish, the, mold, first, densely, filled, the, space, with, plasmodia, and, then, thinned, the, network, to, focus, on, efficiently, connected, branches, the, network, closely, resembled, tokyo, s, rail, system, p, polycephalum, was, used, in, experimental, laboratory, approximations, of, motorway, networks, of, 14, geographical, areas, australia, africa, belgium, brazil, canada, china, germany, iberia, italy, malaysia, mexico, the, netherlands, uk, and, us, the, filamentary, structure, of, p, polycephalum, forming, a, network, to, food, sources, is, similar, to, the, large, scale, galaxy, filament, structure, of, the, universe, this, observation, has, led, astronomers, to, use, simulations, based, on, the, behaviour, of, slime, molds, to, inform, their, search, for, dark, matter, in, central, mexico, the, false, puffball, enteridium, lycoperdon, was, traditionally, used, as, food, it, was, one, of, the, species, which, mushroom, collectors, or, hongueros, gathered, on, trips, into, the, forest, in, the, rainy, season, one, of, its, local, names, is, cheese, mushroom, so, called, for, its, texture, and, flavor, when, cooked, it, was, salted, wrapped, in, a, maize, leaf, and, baked, in, the, ashes, of, a, campfire, or, boiled, and, eaten, with, maize, tortillas, fuligo, septica, was, similarly, collected, in, mexico, cooked, with, onions, and, peppers, and, eaten, in, a, tortilla, in, ecuador, lycogala, epidendrum, was, called, yakich, and, eaten, raw, as, an, appetizer, oscar, requejo, and, n, floro, andres, rodriguez, suggest, that, fuligo, septica, may, have, inspired, irvin, yeaworth, s, 1958, film, the, blob, in, which, a, giant, amoeba, from, space, sets, about, engulfing, people, in, a, small, american, town
