alcoholism, is, the, continued, drinking, of, alcohol, despite, it, causing, problems, some, definitions, require, evidence, of, dependence, and, withdrawal, problematic, use, of, alcohol, has, been, mentioned, in, the, earliest, historical, records, the, world, health, organization, who, estimated, there, were, 283, million, people, with, alcohol, use, disorders, worldwide, as, of, 2016, the, term, alcoholism, was, first, coined, in, 1852, but, alcoholism, and, alcoholic, are, sometimes, considered, stigmatizing, and, to, discourage, seeking, treatment, so, diagnostic, terms, such, as, alcohol, use, disorder, or, alcohol, dependence, are, often, used, instead, in, a, clinical, context, alcohol, is, addictive, and, heavy, long, term, alcohol, use, results, in, many, negative, health, and, social, consequences, it, can, damage, all, the, organ, systems, but, especially, affects, the, brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and, immune, system, heavy, alcohol, usage, can, result, in, trouble, sleeping, and, severe, cognitive, issues, like, dementia, brain, damage, or, wernicke, korsakoff, syndrome, physical, effects, include, irregular, heartbeat, an, impaired, immune, response, liver, cirrhosis, increased, cancer, risk, and, severe, withdrawal, symptoms, if, stopped, suddenly, these, health, effects, can, reduce, life, expectancy, by, 10, years, drinking, during, pregnancy, may, harm, the, child, s, health, and, drunk, driving, increases, the, risk, of, traffic, accidents, alcoholism, is, also, associated, with, increases, in, violent, and, non, violent, crime, while, alcoholism, directly, resulted, in, 139, 000, deaths, worldwide, in, 2013, in, 2012, 3, 3, million, deaths, may, be, attributable, globally, to, alcohol, the, development, of, alcoholism, is, attributed, to, both, environment, and, genetics, equally, the, use, of, alcohol, to, self, medicate, stress, or, anxiety, can, turn, into, alcoholism, someone, with, a, parent, or, sibling, with, an, alcohol, use, disorder, is, three, to, four, times, more, likely, to, develop, an, alcohol, use, disorder, themselves, but, only, a, minority, of, them, do, environmental, factors, include, social, cultural, and, behavioral, influences, high, stress, levels, and, anxiety, as, well, as, alcohol, s, inexpensive, cost, and, easy, accessibility, increase, the, risk, people, may, continue, to, drink, partly, to, prevent, or, improve, symptoms, of, withdrawal, after, a, person, stops, drinking, alcohol, they, may, experience, a, low, level, of, withdrawal, lasting, for, months, medically, alcoholism, is, considered, both, a, physical, and, mental, illness, questionnaires, are, usually, used, to, detect, possible, alcoholism, further, information, is, then, collected, to, confirm, the, diagnosis, treatment, of, alcoholism, may, take, several, forms, due, to, medical, problems, that, can, occur, during, withdrawal, alcohol, cessation, should, be, controlled, carefully, one, common, method, involves, the, use, of, benzodiazepine, medications, such, as, diazepam, these, can, be, taken, while, admitted, to, a, health, care, institution, or, individually, the, medications, acamprosate, or, disulfiram, may, also, be, used, to, help, prevent, further, drinking, mental, illness, or, other, addictions, may, complicate, treatment, various, individual, or, group, therapy, or, support, groups, are, used, to, attempt, to, keep, a, person, from, returning, to, alcoholism, among, them, is, the, abstinence, based, mutual, aid, fellowship, alcoholics, anonymous, aa, a, 2020, scientific, review, found, that, clinical, interventions, encouraging, increased, participation, in, aa, aa, twelve, step, facilitation, aa, tsf, resulted, in, higher, abstinence, rates, over, other, clinical, interventions, and, most, studies, in, the, review, found, that, aa, tsf, led, to, lower, health, costs, many, terms, some, slurs, and, some, informal, have, been, used, to, refer, to, people, affected, by, alcoholism, such, as, tippler, drunkard, dipsomaniac, and, souse, the, risk, of, alcohol, dependence, begins, at, low, levels, of, drinking, and, increases, directly, with, both, the, volume, of, alcohol, consumed, and, a, pattern, of, drinking, larger, amounts, on, an, occasion, to, the, point, of, intoxication, which, is, sometimes, called, binge, drinking, binge, drinking, is, the, most, common, pattern, of, alcoholism, it, has, different, definitions, and, one, of, this, defines, it, as, a, pattern, of, drinking, when, a, male, has, five, or, more, drinks, on, an, occasion, or, a, female, has, at, least, four, drinks, on, an, occasion, alcoholism, is, characterized, by, an, increased, tolerance, to, alcohol, which, means, that, an, individual, can, consume, more, alcohol, and, physical, dependence, on, alcohol, which, makes, it, hard, for, an, individual, to, control, their, consumption, the, physical, dependency, caused, by, alcohol, can, lead, to, an, affected, individual, having, a, very, strong, urge, to, drink, alcohol, these, characteristics, play, a, role, in, decreasing, the, ability, to, stop, drinking, of, an, individual, with, an, alcohol, use, disorder, alcoholism, can, have, adverse, effects, on, mental, health, contributing, to, psychiatric, disorders, and, increasing, the, risk, of, suicide, a, depressed, mood, is, a, common, symptom, of, heavy, alcohol, drinkers, warning, signs, of, alcoholism, include, the, consumption, of, increasing, amounts, of, alcohol, and, frequent, intoxication, preoccupation, with, drinking, to, the, exclusion, of, other, activities, promises, to, quit, drinking, and, failure, to, keep, those, promises, the, inability, to, remember, what, was, said, or, done, while, drinking, colloquially, known, as, blackouts, personality, changes, associated, with, drinking, denial, or, the, making, of, excuses, for, drinking, the, refusal, to, admit, excessive, drinking, dysfunction, or, other, problems, at, work, or, school, the, loss, of, interest, in, personal, appearance, or, hygiene, marital, and, economic, problems, and, the, complaint, of, poor, health, with, loss, of, appetite, respiratory, infections, or, increased, anxiety, drinking, enough, to, cause, a, blood, alcohol, concentration, bac, of, 0, 03, 0, 12, typically, causes, an, overall, improvement, in, mood, and, possible, euphoria, intense, feelings, of, well, being, and, happiness, increased, self, confidence, and, sociability, decreased, anxiety, a, flushed, red, appearance, in, the, face, and, impaired, judgment, and, fine, muscle, coordination, a, bac, of, 0, 09, to, 0, 25, causes, lethargy, sedation, balance, problems, and, blurred, vision, a, bac, of, 0, 18, to, 0, 30, causes, profound, confusion, impaired, speech, e, g, slurred, speech, staggering, dizziness, and, vomiting, a, bac, from, 0, 25, to, 0, 40, causes, stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde, amnesia, vomiting, death, may, occur, due, to, inhalation, of, vomit, while, unconscious, and, respiratory, depression, potentially, life, threatening, a, bac, from, 0, 35, to, 0, 80, causes, a, coma, unconsciousness, life, threatening, respiratory, depression, and, possibly, fatal, alcohol, poisoning, with, all, alcoholic, beverages, drinking, while, driving, operating, an, aircraft, or, heavy, machinery, increases, the, risk, of, an, accident, many, countries, have, penalties, for, drunk, driving, having, more, than, one, drink, a, day, for, women, or, two, drinks, for, men, increases, the, risk, of, heart, disease, high, blood, pressure, atrial, fibrillation, and, stroke, risk, is, greater, with, binge, drinking, which, may, also, result, in, violence, or, accidents, about, 3, 3, million, deaths, 5, 9, of, all, deaths, are, believed, to, be, due, to, alcohol, each, year, alcoholism, reduces, a, person, s, life, expectancy, by, around, ten, years, and, alcohol, use, is, the, third, leading, cause, of, early, death, in, the, united, states, long, term, alcohol, misuse, can, cause, a, number, of, physical, symptoms, including, cirrhosis, of, the, liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic, dementia, heart, disease, nutritional, deficiencies, peptic, ulcers, and, sexual, dysfunction, and, can, eventually, be, fatal, other, physical, effects, include, an, increased, risk, of, developing, cardiovascular, disease, malabsorption, alcoholic, liver, disease, and, several, cancers, such, as, breast, cancer, and, head, and, neck, cancer, damage, to, the, central, nervous, system, and, peripheral, nervous, system, can, occur, from, sustained, alcohol, consumption, a, wide, range, of, immunologic, defects, can, result, and, there, may, be, a, generalized, skeletal, fragility, in, addition, to, a, recognized, tendency, to, accidental, injury, resulting, in, a, propensity, for, bone, fractures, women, develop, long, term, complications, of, alcohol, dependence, more, rapidly, than, do, men, women, also, have, a, higher, mortality, rate, from, alcoholism, than, men, examples, of, long, term, complications, include, brain, heart, and, liver, damage, and, an, increased, risk, of, breast, cancer, additionally, heavy, drinking, over, time, has, been, found, to, have, a, negative, effect, on, reproductive, functioning, in, women, this, results, in, reproductive, dysfunction, such, as, anovulation, decreased, ovarian, mass, problems, or, irregularity, of, the, menstrual, cycle, and, early, menopause, alcoholic, ketoacidosis, can, occur, in, individuals, who, chronically, misuse, alcohol, and, have, a, recent, history, of, binge, drinking, the, amount, of, alcohol, that, can, be, biologically, processed, and, its, effects, differ, between, sexes, equal, dosages, of, alcohol, consumed, by, men, and, women, generally, result, in, women, having, higher, blood, alcohol, concentrations, bacs, since, women, generally, have, a, lower, weight, and, higher, percentage, of, body, fat, and, therefore, a, lower, volume, of, distribution, for, alcohol, than, men, long, term, misuse, of, alcohol, can, cause, a, wide, range, of, mental, health, problems, severe, cognitive, problems, are, common, approximately, 10, of, all, dementia, cases, are, related, to, alcohol, consumption, making, it, the, second, leading, cause, of, dementia, excessive, alcohol, use, causes, damage, to, brain, function, and, psychological, health, can, be, increasingly, affected, over, time, social, skills, are, significantly, impaired, in, people, with, alcoholism, due, to, the, neurotoxic, effects, of, alcohol, on, the, brain, especially, the, prefrontal, cortex, area, of, the, brain, the, social, skills, that, are, impaired, by, alcohol, use, disorder, include, impairments, in, perceiving, facial, emotions, prosody, perception, problems, and, theory, of, mind, deficits, the, ability, to, understand, humor, is, also, impaired, in, people, who, misuse, alcohol, psychiatric, disorders, are, common, in, people, with, alcohol, use, disorders, with, as, many, as, 25, also, having, severe, psychiatric, disturbances, the, most, prevalent, psychiatric, symptoms, are, anxiety, and, depression, disorders, psychiatric, symptoms, usually, initially, worsen, during, alcohol, withdrawal, but, typically, improve, or, disappear, with, continued, abstinence, psychosis, confusion, and, organic, brain, syndrome, may, be, caused, by, alcohol, misuse, which, can, lead, to, a, misdiagnosis, such, as, schizophrenia, panic, disorder, can, develop, or, worsen, as, a, direct, result, of, long, term, alcohol, misuse, the, co, occurrence, of, major, depressive, disorder, and, alcoholism, is, well, documented, among, those, with, comorbid, occurrences, a, distinction, is, commonly, made, between, depressive, episodes, that, remit, with, alcohol, abstinence, substance, induced, and, depressive, episodes, that, are, primary, and, do, not, remit, with, abstinence, independent, episodes, additional, use, of, other, drugs, may, increase, the, risk, of, depression, psychiatric, disorders, differ, depending, on, gender, women, who, have, alcohol, use, disorders, often, have, a, co, occurring, psychiatric, diagnosis, such, as, major, depression, anxiety, panic, disorder, bulimia, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, or, borderline, personality, disorder, men, with, alcohol, use, disorders, more, often, have, a, co, occurring, diagnosis, of, narcissistic, or, antisocial, personality, disorder, bipolar, disorder, schizophrenia, impulse, disorders, or, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, women, with, alcohol, use, disorder, are, more, likely, to, experience, physical, or, sexual, assault, abuse, and, domestic, violence, than, women, in, the, general, population, which, can, lead, to, higher, instances, of, psychiatric, disorders, and, greater, dependence, on, alcohol, serious, social, problems, arise, from, alcohol, use, disorder, these, dilemmas, are, caused, by, the, pathological, changes, in, the, brain, and, the, intoxicating, effects, of, alcohol, alcohol, misuse, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, committing, criminal, offences, including, child, abuse, domestic, violence, rape, burglary, and, assault, alcoholism, is, associated, with, loss, of, employment, which, can, lead, to, financial, problems, drinking, at, inappropriate, times, and, behavior, caused, by, reduced, judgment, can, lead, to, legal, consequences, such, as, criminal, charges, for, drunk, driving, or, public, disorder, or, civil, penalties, for, tortious, behavior, an, alcoholic, s, behavior, and, mental, impairment, while, drunk, can, profoundly, affect, those, surrounding, him, and, lead, to, isolation, from, family, and, friends, this, isolation, can, lead, to, marital, conflict, and, divorce, or, contribute, to, domestic, violence, alcoholism, can, also, lead, to, child, neglect, with, subsequent, lasting, damage, to, the, emotional, development, of, children, of, people, with, alcohol, use, disorders, for, this, reason, children, of, people, with, alcohol, use, disorders, can, develop, a, number, of, emotional, problems, for, example, they, can, become, afraid, of, their, parents, because, of, their, unstable, mood, behaviors, they, may, develop, shame, over, their, inadequacy, to, liberate, their, parents, from, alcoholism, and, as, a, result, of, this, may, develop, self, image, problems, which, can, lead, to, depression, as, with, similar, substances, with, a, sedative, hypnotic, mechanism, such, as, barbiturates, and, benzodiazepines, withdrawal, from, alcohol, dependence, can, be, fatal, if, it, is, not, properly, managed, alcohol, s, primary, effect, is, the, increase, in, stimulation, of, the, gaba, a, receptor, promoting, central, nervous, system, depression, with, repeated, heavy, consumption, of, alcohol, these, receptors, are, desensitized, and, reduced, in, number, resulting, in, tolerance, and, physical, dependence, when, alcohol, consumption, is, stopped, too, abruptly, the, person, s, nervous, system, experiences, uncontrolled, synapse, firing, this, can, result, in, symptoms, that, include, anxiety, life, threatening, seizures, delirium, tremens, hallucinations, shakes, and, possible, heart, failure, other, neurotransmitter, systems, are, also, involved, especially, dopamine, nmda, and, glutamate, severe, acute, withdrawal, symptoms, such, as, delirium, tremens, and, seizures, rarely, occur, after, 1, week, post, cessation, of, alcohol, the, acute, withdrawal, phase, can, be, defined, as, lasting, between, one, and, three, weeks, in, the, period, of, 3, 6, weeks, following, cessation, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and, sleep, disturbance, are, common, similar, post, acute, withdrawal, symptoms, have, also, been, observed, in, animal, models, of, alcohol, dependence, and, withdrawal, a, kindling, effect, also, occurs, in, people, with, alcohol, use, disorders, whereby, each, subsequent, withdrawal, syndrome, is, more, severe, than, the, previous, withdrawal, episode, this, is, due, to, neuroadaptations, which, occur, as, a, result, of, periods, of, abstinence, followed, by, re, exposure, to, alcohol, individuals, who, have, had, multiple, withdrawal, episodes, are, more, likely, to, develop, seizures, and, experience, more, severe, anxiety, during, withdrawal, from, alcohol, than, alcohol, dependent, individuals, without, a, history, of, past, alcohol, withdrawal, episodes, the, kindling, effect, leads, to, persistent, functional, changes, in, brain, neural, circuits, as, well, as, to, gene, expression, kindling, also, results, in, the, intensification, of, psychological, symptoms, of, alcohol, withdrawal, there, are, decision, tools, and, questionnaires, that, help, guide, physicians, in, evaluating, alcohol, withdrawal, for, example, the, ciwa, ar, objectifies, alcohol, withdrawal, symptoms, in, order, to, guide, therapy, decisions, which, allows, for, an, efficient, interview, while, at, the, same, time, retaining, clinical, usefulness, validity, and, reliability, ensuring, proper, care, for, withdrawal, patients, who, can, be, in, danger, of, death, a, complex, combination, of, genetic, and, environmental, factors, influences, the, risk, of, the, development, of, alcoholism, genes, that, influence, the, metabolism, of, alcohol, also, influence, the, risk, of, alcoholism, as, can, a, family, history, of, alcoholism, there, is, compelling, evidence, that, alcohol, use, at, an, early, age, may, influence, the, expression, of, genes, which, increase, the, risk, of, alcohol, dependence, these, genetic, and, epigenetic, results, are, regarded, as, consistent, with, large, longitudinal, population, studies, finding, that, the, younger, the, age, of, drinking, onset, the, greater, the, prevalence, of, lifetime, alcohol, dependence, severe, childhood, trauma, is, also, associated, with, a, general, increase, in, the, risk, of, drug, dependency, lack, of, peer, and, family, support, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, alcoholism, developing, genetics, and, adolescence, are, associated, with, an, increased, sensitivity, to, the, neurotoxic, effects, of, chronic, alcohol, misuse, cortical, degeneration, due, to, the, neurotoxic, effects, increases, impulsive, behaviour, which, may, contribute, to, the, development, persistence, and, severity, of, alcohol, use, disorders, there, is, evidence, that, with, abstinence, there, is, a, reversal, of, at, least, some, of, the, alcohol, induced, central, nervous, system, damage, the, use, of, cannabis, was, associated, with, later, problems, with, alcohol, use, alcohol, use, was, associated, with, an, increased, probability, of, later, use, of, tobacco, and, illegal, drugs, such, as, cannabis, alcohol, is, the, most, available, widely, consumed, and, widely, misused, recreational, drug, beer, alone, is, the, world, s, most, widely, consumed, alcoholic, beverage, it, is, the, third, most, popular, drink, overall, after, water, and, tea, it, is, thought, by, some, to, be, the, oldest, fermented, beverage, based, on, combined, data, in, the, us, from, samhsa, s, 2004, 2005, national, surveys, on, drug, use, health, the, rate, of, past, year, alcohol, dependence, or, misuse, among, persons, aged, 12, or, older, varied, by, level, of, alcohol, use, 44, 7, of, past, month, heavy, drinkers, 18, 5, binge, drinkers, 3, 8, past, month, non, binge, drinkers, and, 1, 3, of, those, who, did, not, drink, alcohol, in, the, past, month, met, the, criteria, for, alcohol, dependence, or, misuse, in, the, past, year, males, had, higher, rates, than, females, for, all, measures, of, drinking, in, the, past, month, any, alcohol, use, 57, 5, vs, 45, binge, drinking, 30, 8, vs, 15, 1, and, heavy, alcohol, use, 10, 5, vs, 3, 3, and, males, were, twice, as, likely, as, females, to, have, met, the, criteria, for, alcohol, dependence, or, misuse, in, the, past, year, 10, 5, vs, 5, 1, however, because, females, generally, weigh, less, than, males, have, more, fat, and, less, water, in, their, bodies, and, metabolize, less, alcohol, in, their, esophagus, and, stomach, they, are, likely, to, develop, higher, blood, alcohol, levels, per, drink, women, may, also, be, more, vulnerable, to, liver, disease, there, are, genetic, variations, that, affect, the, risk, for, alcoholism, some, of, these, variations, are, more, common, in, individuals, with, ancestry, from, certain, areas, for, example, africa, east, asia, the, middle, east, and, europe, the, variants, with, strongest, effect, are, in, genes, that, encode, the, main, enzymes, of, alcohol, metabolism, adh1b, and, aldh2, these, genetic, factors, influence, the, rate, at, which, alcohol, and, its, initial, metabolic, product, acetaldehyde, are, metabolized, they, are, found, at, different, frequencies, in, people, from, different, parts, of, the, world, the, alcohol, dehydrogenase, allele, adh1b, 2, causes, a, more, rapid, metabolism, of, alcohol, to, acetaldehyde, and, reduces, risk, for, alcoholism, it, is, most, common, in, individuals, from, east, asia, and, the, middle, east, the, alcohol, dehydrogenase, allele, adh1b, 3, also, causes, a, more, rapid, metabolism, of, alcohol, the, allele, adh1b, 3, is, only, found, in, some, individuals, of, african, descent, and, certain, native, american, tribes, african, americans, and, native, americans, with, this, allele, have, a, reduced, risk, of, developing, alcoholism, native, americans, however, have, a, significantly, higher, rate, of, alcoholism, than, average, risk, factors, such, as, cultural, environmental, effects, e, g, trauma, have, been, proposed, to, explain, the, higher, rates, the, aldehyde, dehydrogenase, allele, aldh2, 2, greatly, reduces, the, rate, at, which, acetaldehyde, the, initial, product, of, alcohol, metabolism, is, removed, by, conversion, to, acetate, it, greatly, reduces, the, risk, for, alcoholism, a, genome, wide, association, study, gwas, of, more, than, 100, 000, human, individuals, identified, variants, of, the, gene, klb, which, encodes, the, transmembrane, protein, klotho, as, highly, associated, with, alcohol, consumption, the, protein, klotho, is, an, essential, element, in, cell, surface, receptors, for, hormones, involved, in, modulation, of, appetites, for, simple, sugars, and, alcohol, several, large, gwas, have, found, differences, in, the, genetics, of, alcohol, consumption, and, alcohol, dependence, although, the, two, are, to, some, degree, related, alcohol, induced, dna, damage, when, not, properly, repaired, may, have, a, key, role, in, the, neurotoxicity, induced, by, alcohol, metabolic, conversion, of, ethanol, to, acetaldehyde, can, occur, in, the, brain, and, the, neurotoxic, effects, of, ethanol, appear, to, be, associated, with, acetaldehyde, induced, dna, damages, including, dna, adducts, and, crosslinks, in, addition, to, acetaldehyde, alcohol, metabolism, produces, potentially, genotoxic, reactive, oxygen, species, which, have, been, demonstrated, to, cause, oxidative, dna, damage, because, there, is, disagreement, on, the, definition, of, the, word, alcoholism, it, is, not, a, recognized, diagnosis, and, the, use, of, the, term, alcoholism, is, discouraged, due, to, its, heavily, stigmatized, connotations, it, is, classified, as, alcohol, use, disorder, in, the, dsm, 5, or, alcohol, dependence, in, the, icd, 11, in, 1979, the, world, health, organization, discouraged, the, use, of, alcoholism, due, to, its, inexact, meaning, preferring, alcohol, dependence, syndrome, misuse, problem, use, abuse, and, heavy, use, of, alcohol, refer, to, improper, use, of, alcohol, which, may, cause, physical, social, or, moral, harm, to, the, drinker, the, dietary, guidelines, for, americans, issued, by, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, usda, in, 2005, defines, moderate, use, as, no, more, than, two, alcoholic, beverages, a, day, for, men, and, no, more, than, one, alcoholic, beverage, a, day, for, women, the, national, institute, on, alcohol, abuse, and, alcoholism, niaaa, defines, binge, drinking, as, the, amount, of, alcohol, leading, to, a, blood, alcohol, content, bac, of, 0, 08, which, for, most, adults, would, be, reached, by, consuming, five, drinks, for, men, or, four, for, women, over, a, two, hour, period, according, to, the, niaaa, men, may, be, at, risk, for, alcohol, related, problems, if, their, alcohol, consumption, exceeds, 14, standard, drinks, per, week, or, 4, drinks, per, day, and, women, may, be, at, risk, if, they, have, more, than, 7, standard, drinks, per, week, or, 3, drinks, per, day, it, defines, a, standard, drink, as, one, 12, ounce, bottle, of, beer, one, 5, ounce, glass, of, wine, or, 1, 5, ounces, of, distilled, spirits, despite, this, risk, a, 2014, report, in, the, national, survey, on, drug, use, and, health, found, that, only, 10, of, either, heavy, drinkers, or, binge, drinkers, defined, according, to, the, above, criteria, also, met, the, criteria, for, alcohol, dependence, while, only, 1, 3, of, non, binge, drinkers, met, the, criteria, an, inference, drawn, from, this, study, is, that, evidence, based, policy, strategies, and, clinical, preventive, services, may, effectively, reduce, binge, drinking, without, requiring, addiction, treatment, in, most, cases, the, term, alcoholism, is, commonly, used, amongst, laypeople, but, the, word, is, poorly, defined, despite, the, imprecision, inherent, in, the, term, there, have, been, attempts, to, define, how, the, word, alcoholism, should, be, interpreted, when, encountered, in, 1992, it, was, defined, by, the, national, council, on, alcoholism, and, drug, dependence, ncadd, and, asam, as, a, primary, chronic, disease, characterized, by, impaired, control, over, drinking, preoccupation, with, the, drug, alcohol, use, of, alcohol, despite, adverse, consequences, and, distortions, in, thinking, mesh, has, had, an, entry, for, alcoholism, since, 1999, and, references, the, 1992, definition, the, who, calls, alcoholism, a, term, of, long, standing, use, and, variable, meaning, and, use, of, the, term, was, disfavored, by, a, 1979, who, expert, committee, in, professional, and, research, contexts, the, term, alcoholism, is, not, currently, favored, but, rather, alcohol, abuse, alcohol, dependence, or, alcohol, use, disorder, are, used, talbot, 1989, observes, that, alcoholism, in, the, classical, disease, model, follows, a, progressive, course, if, people, continue, to, drink, their, condition, will, worsen, this, will, lead, to, harmful, consequences, in, their, lives, physically, mentally, emotionally, and, socially, johnson, 1980, proposed, that, the, emotional, progression, of, the, addicted, people, s, response, to, alcohol, has, four, phases, the, first, two, are, considered, normal, drinking, and, the, last, two, are, viewed, as, typical, alcoholic, drinking, johnson, s, four, phases, consist, of, in, the, united, states, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, is, the, most, common, diagnostic, guide, for, substance, use, disorders, whereas, most, countries, use, the, international, classification, of, diseases, icd, for, diagnostic, and, other, purposes, the, two, manuals, use, similar, but, not, identical, nomenclature, to, classify, alcohol, problems, attitudes, and, social, stereotypes, can, create, barriers, to, the, detection, and, treatment, of, alcohol, use, disorder, this, is, more, of, a, barrier, for, women, than, men, fear, of, stigmatization, may, lead, women, to, deny, that, they, have, a, medical, condition, to, hide, their, drinking, and, to, drink, alone, this, pattern, in, turn, leads, family, physicians, and, others, to, be, less, likely, to, suspect, that, a, woman, they, know, has, alcohol, use, disorder, in, contrast, reduced, fear, of, stigma, may, lead, men, to, admit, that, they, are, having, a, medical, condition, to, display, their, drinking, publicly, and, to, drink, in, groups, this, pattern, in, turn, leads, family, physicians, and, others, to, be, more, likely, to, suspect, that, a, man, they, know, is, someone, with, an, alcohol, use, disorder, screening, is, recommended, among, those, over, the, age, of, 18, several, tools, may, be, used, to, detect, a, loss, of, control, of, alcohol, use, these, tools, are, mostly, self, reports, in, questionnaire, form, another, common, theme, is, a, score, or, tally, that, sums, up, the, general, severity, of, alcohol, use, the, cage, questionnaire, named, for, its, four, questions, is, one, such, example, that, may, be, used, to, screen, patients, quickly, in, a, doctor, s, office, two, yes, responses, indicate, that, the, respondent, should, be, investigated, further, the, questionnaire, asks, the, following, questions, other, tests, are, sometimes, used, for, the, detection, of, alcohol, dependence, such, as, the, alcohol, dependence, data, questionnaire, which, is, a, more, sensitive, diagnostic, test, than, the, cage, questionnaire, it, helps, distinguish, a, diagnosis, of, alcohol, dependence, from, one, of, heavy, alcohol, use, the, michigan, alcohol, screening, test, mast, is, a, screening, tool, for, alcoholism, widely, used, by, courts, to, determine, the, appropriate, sentencing, for, people, convicted, of, alcohol, related, offenses, driving, under, the, influence, being, the, most, common, the, alcohol, use, disorders, identification, test, audit, a, screening, questionnaire, developed, by, the, world, health, organization, is, unique, in, that, it, has, been, validated, in, six, countries, and, is, used, internationally, like, the, cage, questionnaire, it, uses, a, simple, set, of, questions, a, high, score, earning, a, deeper, investigation, the, paddington, alcohol, test, pat, was, designed, to, screen, for, alcohol, related, problems, amongst, those, attending, accident, and, emergency, departments, it, concords, well, with, the, audit, questionnaire, but, is, administered, in, a, fifth, of, the, time, there, are, reliable, tests, for, the, actual, use, of, alcohol, one, common, test, being, that, of, blood, alcohol, content, bac, these, tests, do, not, differentiate, people, with, alcohol, use, disorders, from, people, without, however, long, term, heavy, drinking, does, have, a, few, recognizable, effects, on, the, body, including, with, regard, to, alcoholism, bac, is, useful, to, judge, alcohol, tolerance, which, in, turn, is, a, sign, of, alcoholism, electrolyte, and, acid, base, abnormalities, including, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, hyperuricemia, metabolic, acidosis, and, respiratory, alkalosis, are, common, in, people, with, alcohol, use, disorders, however, none, of, these, blood, tests, for, biological, markers, is, as, sensitive, as, screening, questionnaires, the, world, health, organization, the, european, union, and, other, regional, bodies, national, governments, and, parliaments, have, formed, alcohol, policies, in, order, to, reduce, the, harm, of, alcoholism, increasing, the, age, at, which, alcohol, can, be, purchased, and, banning, or, restricting, alcohol, beverage, advertising, are, common, methods, to, reduce, alcohol, use, among, adolescents, and, young, adults, in, particular, another, common, method, of, alcoholism, prevention, is, taxation, of, alcohol, products, increasing, price, of, alcohol, by, 10, is, linked, with, reduction, of, consumption, of, up, to, 10, credible, evidence, based, educational, campaigns, in, the, mass, media, about, the, consequences, of, alcohol, misuse, have, been, recommended, guidelines, for, parents, to, prevent, alcohol, misuse, amongst, adolescents, and, for, helping, young, people, with, mental, health, problems, have, also, been, suggested, because, alcohol, is, often, used, for, self, medication, of, conditions, like, anxiety, temporarily, prevention, of, alcoholism, may, be, attempted, by, reducing, the, severity, or, prevalence, of, stress, and, anxiety, in, individuals, treatments, are, varied, because, there, are, multiple, perspectives, of, alcoholism, those, who, approach, alcoholism, as, a, medical, condition, or, disease, recommend, differing, treatments, from, for, instance, those, who, approach, the, condition, as, one, of, social, choice, most, treatments, focus, on, helping, people, discontinue, their, alcohol, intake, followed, up, with, life, training, and, or, social, support, to, help, them, resist, a, return, to, alcohol, use, since, alcoholism, involves, multiple, factors, which, encourage, a, person, to, continue, drinking, they, must, all, be, addressed, to, successfully, prevent, a, relapse, an, example, of, this, kind, of, treatment, is, detoxification, followed, by, a, combination, of, supportive, therapy, attendance, at, self, help, groups, and, ongoing, development, of, coping, mechanisms, much, of, the, treatment, community, for, alcoholism, supports, an, abstinence, based, zero, tolerance, approach, popularized, by, the, 12, step, program, of, alcoholics, anonymous, however, some, prefer, a, harm, reduction, approach, medical, treatment, for, alcohol, detoxification, usually, involves, administration, of, a, benzodiazepine, in, order, to, ameliorate, alcohol, withdrawal, syndrome, s, adverse, impact, the, addition, of, phenobarbital, improves, outcomes, if, benzodiazepine, administration, lacks, the, usual, efficacy, and, phenobarbital, alone, might, be, an, effective, treatment, propofol, also, might, enhance, treatment, for, individuals, showing, limited, therapeutic, response, to, a, benzodiazepine, individuals, who, are, only, at, risk, of, mild, to, moderate, withdrawal, symptoms, can, be, treated, as, outpatients, individuals, at, risk, of, a, severe, withdrawal, syndrome, as, well, as, those, who, have, significant, or, acute, comorbid, conditions, can, be, treated, as, inpatients, direct, treatment, can, be, followed, by, a, treatment, program, for, alcohol, dependence, or, alcohol, use, disorder, to, attempt, to, reduce, the, risk, of, relapse, experiences, following, alcohol, withdrawal, such, as, depressed, mood, and, anxiety, can, take, weeks, or, months, to, abate, while, other, symptoms, persist, longer, due, to, persisting, neuroadaptations, various, forms, of, group, therapy, or, psychotherapy, are, sometimes, used, to, encourage, and, support, abstinence, from, alcohol, or, to, reduce, alcohol, consumption, to, levels, that, are, not, associated, with, adverse, outcomes, mutual, aid, group, counseling, is, an, approach, used, to, facilitate, relapse, prevention, alcoholics, anonymous, was, one, of, the, earliest, organizations, formed, to, provide, mutual, peer, support, and, non, professional, counseling, however, the, effectiveness, of, alcoholics, anonymous, is, disputed, a, 2020, cochrane, review, concluded, that, twelve, step, facilitation, tsf, probably, achieves, outcomes, such, as, fewer, drinks, per, drinking, day, however, evidence, for, such, a, conclusion, comes, from, low, to, moderate, certainty, evidence, so, should, be, regarded, with, caution, others, include, lifering, secular, recovery, smart, recovery, women, for, sobriety, and, secular, organizations, for, sobriety, manualized, twelve, step, facilitation, tsf, interventions, i, e, therapy, which, encourages, active, long, term, alcoholics, anonymous, participation, for, alcohol, use, disorder, lead, to, higher, abstinence, rates, compared, to, other, clinical, interventions, and, to, wait, list, control, groups, moderate, drinking, amongst, people, with, alcohol, dependence, often, termed, controlled, drinking, has, been, subject, to, significant, controversy, indeed, much, of, the, skepticism, toward, the, viability, of, moderate, drinking, goals, stems, from, historical, ideas, about, alcoholism, now, replaced, with, alcohol, use, disorder, or, alcohol, dependence, in, most, scientific, contexts, a, 2021, meta, analysis, and, systematic, review, of, controlled, drinking, covering, 22, studies, concluded, controlled, drinking, was, a, non, inferior, outcome, to, abstinence, for, many, drinkers, rationing, and, moderation, programs, such, as, moderation, management, and, drinkwise, do, not, mandate, complete, abstinence, while, most, people, with, alcohol, use, disorders, are, unable, to, limit, their, drinking, in, this, way, some, return, to, moderate, drinking, a, 2002, us, study, by, the, national, institute, on, alcohol, abuse, and, alcoholism, niaaa, showed, that, 17, 7, of, individuals, diagnosed, as, alcohol, dependent, more, than, one, year, prior, returned, to, low, risk, drinking, this, group, however, showed, fewer, initial, symptoms, of, dependency, a, follow, up, study, using, the, same, subjects, that, were, judged, to, be, in, remission, in, 2001, 2002, examined, the, rates, of, return, to, problem, drinking, in, 2004, 2005, the, study, found, abstinence, from, alcohol, was, the, most, stable, form, of, remission, for, recovering, alcoholics, there, was, also, a, 1973, study, showing, chronic, alcoholics, drinking, moderately, again, but, a, 1982, follow, up, showed, that, 95, of, subjects, were, not, able, to, maintain, drinking, in, moderation, over, the, long, term, another, study, was, a, long, term, 60, year, follow, up, of, two, groups, of, alcoholic, men, which, concluded, that, return, to, controlled, drinking, rarely, persisted, for, much, more, than, a, decade, without, relapse, or, evolution, into, abstinence, internet, based, measures, appear, to, be, useful, at, least, in, the, short, term, in, the, united, states, there, are, four, approved, medications, for, alcoholism, acamprosate, two, methods, of, using, naltrexone, and, disulfiram, several, other, drugs, are, also, used, and, many, are, under, investigation, evidence, does, not, support, the, use, of, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitors, ssris, tricyclic, antidepressants, tcas, antipsychotics, or, gabapentin, topiramate, a, derivative, of, the, naturally, occurring, sugar, monosaccharide, d, fructose, has, been, found, effective, in, helping, alcoholics, quit, or, cut, back, on, the, amount, they, drink, evidence, suggests, that, topiramate, antagonizes, excitatory, glutamate, receptors, inhibits, dopamine, release, and, enhances, inhibitory, gamma, aminobutyric, acid, function, a, 2008, review, of, the, effectiveness, of, topiramate, concluded, that, the, results, of, published, trials, are, promising, however, as, of, 2008, data, was, insufficient, to, support, using, topiramate, in, conjunction, with, brief, weekly, compliance, counseling, as, a, first, line, agent, for, alcohol, dependence, a, 2010, review, found, that, topiramate, may, be, superior, to, existing, alcohol, pharmacotherapeutic, options, topiramate, effectively, reduces, craving, and, alcohol, withdrawal, severity, as, well, as, improving, quality, of, life, ratings, baclofen, a, gaba, b, receptor, agonist, is, under, study, for, the, treatment, of, alcoholism, according, to, a, 2017, cochrane, systematic, review, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, determine, the, effectiveness, or, safety, for, the, use, of, baclofen, for, withdrawal, symptoms, in, alcoholism, psilocybin, assisted, psychotherapy, is, under, study, for, the, treatment, of, patients, with, alcohol, use, disorder, alcoholics, may, also, require, treatment, for, other, psychotropic, drug, addictions, and, drug, dependencies, the, most, common, dual, dependence, syndrome, with, alcohol, dependence, is, benzodiazepine, dependence, with, studies, showing, 10, 20, of, alcohol, dependent, individuals, had, problems, of, dependence, and, or, misuse, problems, of, benzodiazepine, drugs, such, as, diazepam, or, clonazepam, these, drugs, are, like, alcohol, depressants, benzodiazepines, may, be, used, legally, if, they, are, prescribed, by, doctors, for, anxiety, problems, or, other, mood, disorders, or, they, may, be, purchased, as, illegal, drugs, benzodiazepine, use, increases, cravings, for, alcohol, and, the, volume, of, alcohol, consumed, by, problem, drinkers, benzodiazepine, dependency, requires, careful, reduction, in, dosage, to, avoid, benzodiazepine, withdrawal, syndrome, and, other, health, consequences, dependence, on, other, sedative, hypnotics, such, as, zolpidem, and, zopiclone, as, well, as, opiates, and, illegal, drugs, is, common, in, alcoholics, alcohol, itself, is, a, sedative, hypnotic, and, is, cross, tolerant, with, other, sedative, hypnotics, such, as, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and, nonbenzodiazepines, dependence, upon, and, withdrawal, from, sedative, hypnotics, can, be, medically, severe, and, as, with, alcohol, withdrawal, there, is, a, risk, of, psychosis, or, seizures, if, not, properly, managed, the, world, health, organization, estimates, that, as, of, 2016, there, are, about, 380, million, people, with, alcoholism, worldwide, 5, 1, of, the, population, over, 15, years, of, age, with, it, being, most, common, among, males, and, young, adults, geographically, it, is, least, common, in, africa, 1, 1, of, the, population, and, has, the, highest, rates, in, eastern, europe, 11, as, of, 2015, in, the, united, states, about, 17, million, 7, of, adults, and, 0, 7, million, 2, 8, of, those, age, 12, to, 17, years, of, age, are, affected, about, 12, of, american, adults, have, had, an, alcohol, dependence, problem, at, some, time, in, their, life, in, the, united, states, and, western, europe, 10, 20, of, men, and, 5, 10, of, women, at, some, point, in, their, lives, will, meet, criteria, for, alcoholism, in, england, the, number, of, dependent, drinkers, was, calculated, as, over, 600, 000, in, 2019, estonia, had, the, highest, death, rate, from, alcohol, in, europe, in, 2015, at, 8, 8, per, 100, 000, population, in, the, united, states, 30, of, people, admitted, to, hospital, have, a, problem, related, to, alcohol, within, the, medical, and, scientific, communities, there, is, a, broad, consensus, regarding, alcoholism, as, a, disease, state, for, example, the, american, medical, association, considers, alcohol, a, drug, and, states, that, drug, addiction, is, a, chronic, relapsing, brain, disease, characterized, by, compulsive, drug, seeking, and, use, despite, often, devastating, consequences, it, results, from, a, complex, interplay, of, biological, vulnerability, environmental, exposure, and, developmental, factors, e, g, stage, of, brain, maturity, alcoholism, has, a, higher, prevalence, among, men, though, in, recent, decades, the, proportion, of, female, alcoholics, has, increased, current, evidence, indicates, that, in, both, men, and, women, alcoholism, is, 50, 60, genetically, determined, leaving, 40, 50, for, environmental, influences, most, alcoholics, develop, alcoholism, during, adolescence, or, young, adulthood, alcoholism, often, reduces, a, person, s, life, expectancy, by, around, ten, years, the, most, common, cause, of, death, in, alcoholics, is, from, cardiovascular, complications, there, is, a, high, rate, of, suicide, in, chronic, alcoholics, which, increases, the, longer, a, person, drinks, approximately, 3, 15, of, alcoholics, die, by, suicide, and, research, has, found, that, over, 50, of, all, suicides, are, associated, with, alcohol, or, drug, dependence, this, is, believed, to, be, due, to, alcohol, causing, physiological, distortion, of, brain, chemistry, as, well, as, social, isolation, suicide, is, also, common, in, adolescent, alcohol, abusers, research, in, 2000, found, that, 25, of, suicides, in, adolescents, were, related, to, alcohol, abuse, among, those, with, alcohol, dependence, after, one, year, some, met, the, criteria, for, low, risk, drinking, even, though, only, 26, of, the, group, received, any, treatment, with, the, breakdown, as, follows, 25, were, found, to, be, still, dependent, 27, were, in, partial, remission, some, symptoms, persist, 12, asymptomatic, drinkers, consumption, increases, chances, of, relapse, and, 36, were, fully, recovered, made, up, of, 18, low, risk, drinkers, plus, 18, abstainers, in, contrast, however, the, results, of, a, long, term, 60, year, follow, up, of, two, groups, of, alcoholic, men, indicated, that, return, to, controlled, drinking, rarely, persisted, for, much, more, than, a, decade, without, relapse, or, evolution, into, abstinence, return, to, controlled, drinking, as, reported, in, short, term, studies, is, often, a, mirage, historically, the, name, dipsomania, was, coined, by, german, physician, c, w, hufeland, in, 1819, before, it, was, superseded, by, alcoholism, that, term, now, has, a, more, specific, meaning, the, term, alcoholism, was, first, used, by, swedish, physician, magnus, huss, in, an, 1852, publication, to, describe, the, systemic, adverse, effects, of, alcohol, alcohol, has, a, long, history, of, use, and, misuse, throughout, recorded, history, biblical, egyptian, and, babylonian, sources, record, the, history, of, abuse, and, dependence, on, alcohol, in, some, ancient, cultures, alcohol, was, worshiped, and, in, others, its, misuse, was, condemned, excessive, alcohol, misuse, and, drunkenness, were, recognized, as, causing, social, problems, even, thousands, of, years, ago, however, the, defining, of, habitual, drunkenness, as, it, was, then, known, as, and, its, adverse, consequences, were, not, well, established, medically, until, the, 18th, century, in, 1647, a, greek, monk, named, agapios, was, the, first, to, document, that, chronic, alcohol, misuse, was, associated, with, toxicity, to, the, nervous, system, and, body, which, resulted, in, a, range, of, medical, disorders, such, as, seizures, paralysis, and, internal, bleeding, in, the, 1910s, and, 1920s, the, effects, of, alcohol, misuse, and, chronic, drunkenness, boosted, membership, of, the, temperance, movement, and, led, to, the, prohibition, of, alcohol, in, many, countries, in, north, america, and, the, nordic, countries, nationwide, bans, on, the, production, importation, transportation, and, sale, of, alcoholic, beverages, that, generally, remained, in, place, until, the, late, 1920s, or, early, 1930s, these, policies, resulted, in, the, decline, of, death, rates, from, cirrhosis, and, alcoholism, in, 2005, alcohol, dependence, and, misuse, was, estimated, to, cost, the, us, economy, approximately, 220, billion, dollars, per, year, more, than, cancer, and, obesity, the, various, health, problems, associated, with, long, term, alcohol, consumption, are, generally, perceived, as, detrimental, to, society, for, example, money, due, to, lost, labor, hours, medical, costs, due, to, injuries, due, to, drunkenness, and, organ, damage, from, long, term, use, and, secondary, treatment, costs, such, as, the, costs, of, rehabilitation, facilities, and, detoxification, centers, alcohol, use, is, a, major, contributing, factor, for, head, injuries, motor, vehicle, injuries, 27, interpersonal, violence, 18, suicides, 18, and, epilepsy, 13, beyond, the, financial, costs, that, alcohol, consumption, imposes, there, are, also, significant, social, costs, to, both, the, alcoholic, and, their, family, and, friends, for, instance, alcohol, consumption, by, a, pregnant, woman, can, lead, to, an, incurable, and, damaging, condition, known, as, fetal, alcohol, syndrome, which, often, results, in, cognitive, deficits, mental, health, problems, an, inability, to, live, independently, and, an, increased, risk, of, criminal, behaviour, all, of, which, can, cause, emotional, stress, for, parents, and, caregivers, estimates, of, the, economic, costs, of, alcohol, misuse, collected, by, the, world, health, organization, vary, from, 1, 6, of, a, country, s, gdp, one, australian, estimate, pegged, alcohol, s, social, costs, at, 24, of, all, drug, misuse, costs, a, similar, canadian, study, concluded, alcohol, s, share, was, 41, one, study, quantified, the, cost, to, the, uk, of, all, forms, of, alcohol, misuse, in, 2001, as, 18, 5, 20, billion, all, economic, costs, in, the, united, states, in, 2006, have, been, estimated, at, 223, 5, billion, the, idea, of, hitting, rock, bottom, refers, to, an, experience, of, stress, that, can, be, attributed, to, alcohol, misuse, there, is, no, single, definition, for, this, idea, and, people, may, identify, their, own, lowest, points, in, terms, of, lost, jobs, lost, relationships, health, problems, legal, problems, or, other, consequences, of, alcohol, misuse, the, concept, is, promoted, by, 12, step, recovery, groups, and, researchers, using, the, transtheoretical, model, of, motivation, for, behavior, change, the, first, use, of, this, slang, phrase, in, the, formal, medical, literature, appeared, in, a, 1965, review, in, the, british, medical, journal, which, said, that, some, men, refused, treatment, until, they, hit, rock, bottom, but, that, treatment, was, generally, more, successful, for, the, alcohol, addict, who, has, friends, and, family, to, support, him, than, for, impoverished, and, homeless, addicts, stereotypes, of, alcoholics, are, often, found, in, fiction, and, popular, culture, the, town, drunk, is, a, stock, character, in, western, popular, culture, stereotypes, of, drunkenness, may, be, based, on, racism, or, xenophobia, as, in, the, fictional, depiction, of, the, irish, as, heavy, drinkers, studies, by, social, psychologists, stivers, and, greeley, attempt, to, document, the, perceived, prevalence, of, high, alcohol, consumption, amongst, the, irish, in, america, alcohol, consumption, is, relatively, similar, between, many, european, cultures, the, united, states, and, australia, in, asian, countries, that, have, a, high, gross, domestic, product, there, is, heightened, drinking, compared, to, other, asian, countries, but, it, is, nowhere, near, as, high, as, it, is, in, other, countries, like, the, united, states, it, is, also, inversely, seen, with, countries, that, have, very, low, gross, domestic, product, showing, high, alcohol, consumption, in, a, study, done, on, korean, immigrants, in, canada, they, reported, alcohol, was, typically, an, integral, part, of, their, meal, but, is, the, only, time, solo, drinking, should, occur, they, also, generally, believe, alcohol, is, necessary, at, any, social, event, as, it, helps, conversations, start, peyote, a, psychoactive, agent, has, even, shown, promise, in, treating, alcoholism, alcohol, had, actually, replaced, peyote, as, native, americans, psychoactive, agent, of, choice, in, rituals, when, peyote, was, outlawed
