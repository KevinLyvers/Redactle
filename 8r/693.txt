flamingos, or, flamingoes, f, l, m, o, z, are, a, type, of, wading, bird, in, the, family, phoenicopteridae, which, is, the, only, extant, family, in, the, order, phoenicopteriformes, there, are, four, flamingo, species, distributed, throughout, the, americas, including, the, caribbean, and, two, species, native, to, afro, eurasia, a, group, of, flamingoes, is, called, a, flamboyance, the, name, flamingo, comes, from, portuguese, or, spanish, flamengo, flame, colored, which, in, turn, comes, from, proven, al, flamenc, a, combination, of, flama, flame, and, a, germanic, like, suffix, ing, the, word, may, also, have, been, influenced, by, the, spanish, ethnonym, flamenco, fleming, or, flemish, the, name, of, the, genus, phoenicopterus, is, from, ancient, greek, phoinikopteros, crimson, red, feathered, other, genera, names, include, phoeniconaias, which, means, crimson, red, water, nymph, or, naiad, and, phoenicoparrus, which, means, crimson, red, bird, though, an, unknown, bird, of, omen, the, family, phoenicopteridae, was, introduced, by, the, french, zoologist, charles, lucien, bonaparte, in, 1831, with, phoenicopterus, as, the, type, genus, traditionally, the, long, legged, ciconiiformes, probably, a, paraphyletic, assemblage, have, been, considered, the, flamingos, closest, relatives, and, the, family, was, included, in, the, order, usually, the, ibises, and, spoonbills, of, the, threskiornithidae, were, considered, their, closest, relatives, within, this, order, earlier, genetic, studies, such, as, those, of, charles, sibley, and, colleagues, also, supported, this, relationship, relationships, to, the, waterfowl, were, considered, as, well, especially, as, flamingos, are, parasitized, by, feather, lice, of, the, genus, anaticola, which, are, otherwise, exclusively, found, on, ducks, and, geese, the, peculiar, presbyornithids, were, used, to, argue, for, a, close, relationship, between, flamingos, waterfowl, and, waders, a, 2002, paper, concluded, they, are, waterfowl, but, a, 2014, comprehensive, study, of, bird, orders, found, that, flamingos, and, grebes, are, not, waterfowl, but, rather, are, part, of, columbea, along, with, doves, sandgrouse, and, mesites, recent, molecular, studies, have, suggested, a, relation, with, grebes, while, morphological, evidence, also, strongly, supports, a, relationship, between, flamingos, and, grebes, they, hold, at, least, 11, morphological, traits, in, common, which, are, not, found, in, other, birds, many, of, these, characteristics, have, been, previously, identified, on, flamingos, but, not, on, grebes, the, fossil, palaelodids, can, be, considered, evolutionarily, and, ecologically, intermediate, between, flamingos, and, grebes, for, the, grebe, flamingo, clade, the, taxon, mirandornithes, miraculous, birds, due, to, their, extreme, divergence, and, apomorphies, has, been, proposed, alternatively, they, could, be, placed, in, one, order, with, phoenocopteriformes, taking, priority, the, cladogram, below, showing, the, phylogenetic, relationships, between, the, six, extant, flamingo, species, is, based, on, a, study, by, roberto, frias, soler, and, collaborators, that, was, published, in, 2022, lesser, flamingo, phoeniconaias, minor, andean, flamingo, phoenicoparrus, andinus, james, s, flamingo, phoenicoparrus, jamesi, chilean, flamingo, phoenicopterus, chilensis, greater, flamingo, phoenicopterus, roseus, american, flamingo, phoenicopterus, ruber, six, extant, flamingo, species, are, recognized, by, most, sources, and, were, formerly, placed, in, one, genus, have, common, characteristics, phoenicopterus, as, a, result, of, a, 2014, publication, the, family, was, reclassified, into, two, genera, in, 2020, the, family, had, three, recognized, genera, according, to, hbw, prehistoric, species, of, flamingo, flamingos, usually, stand, on, one, leg, with, the, other, tucked, beneath, the, body, the, reason, for, this, behaviour, is, not, fully, understood, one, theory, is, that, standing, on, one, leg, allows, the, birds, to, conserve, more, body, heat, given, that, they, spend, a, significant, amount, of, time, wading, in, cold, water, however, the, behaviour, also, takes, place, in, warm, water, and, is, also, observed, in, birds, that, do, not, typically, stand, in, water, an, alternative, theory, is, that, standing, on, one, leg, reduces, the, energy, expenditure, for, producing, muscular, effort, to, stand, and, balance, on, one, leg, a, study, on, cadavers, showed, that, the, one, legged, pose, could, be, held, without, any, muscle, activity, while, living, flamingos, demonstrate, substantially, less, body, sway, in, a, one, legged, posture, while, walking, a, flamingo, s, legs, may, appear, to, bend, backwards, this, appearance, is, due, to, the, middle, joint, on, their, legs, being, their, ankle, not, their, knee, flamingos, also, have, webbed, feet, that, aid, with, swimming, and, they, may, stamp, their, feet, in, the, mud, to, stir, up, food, from, the, bottom, flamingos, are, capable, flyers, and, flamingos, in, captivity, often, require, wing, clipping, to, prevent, escape, a, pair, of, african, flamingos, which, had, not, yet, had, their, wings, clipped, escaped, from, the, wichita, kansas, zoo, in, 2005, one, was, spotted, in, texas, 14, years, later, it, had, been, seen, previously, by, birders, in, texas, wisconsin, and, louisiana, young, flamingos, hatch, with, grayish, red, plumage, but, adults, range, from, light, pink, to, bright, red, due, to, aqueous, bacteria, and, beta, carotene, obtained, from, their, food, supply, a, well, fed, healthy, flamingo, is, more, vibrantly, colored, thus, a, more, desirable, mate, a, white, or, pale, flamingo, however, is, usually, unhealthy, or, malnourished, captive, flamingos, are, a, notable, exception, even, if, adequately, nourished, they, may, turn, a, pale, pink, if, they, are, not, fed, carotene, at, levels, comparable, to, the, wild, the, greater, flamingo, is, the, tallest, of, the, six, different, species, of, flamingos, standing, at, 3, 9, to, 4, 7, feet, 1, 2, to, 1, 4, m, with, a, weight, up, to, 7, 7, pounds, 3, 5, kg, and, the, shortest, flamingo, species, the, lesser, has, a, height, of, 2, 6, feet, 0, 8, m, and, weighs, 5, 5, pounds, 2, 5, kg, flamingos, can, have, a, wingspan, as, small, as, 37, inches, 94, cm, to, as, big, as, 59, inches, 150, cm, flamingos, can, open, their, bills, by, raising, the, upper, jaw, as, well, as, by, dropping, the, lower, flamingos, are, omnivores, who, filter, feed, on, brine, shrimp, and, blue, green, algae, as, well, as, insect, larvae, small, insects, mollusks, and, crustaceans, their, bills, are, specially, adapted, to, separate, mud, and, silt, from, the, food, they, eat, and, are, uniquely, used, upside, down, the, filtering, of, food, items, is, assisted, by, hairy, structures, called, lamellae, which, line, the, mandibles, and, the, large, rough, surfaced, tongue, the, pink, or, reddish, color, of, flamingos, comes, from, carotenoids, in, their, diet, of, animal, and, plant, plankton, american, flamingos, are, a, brighter, red, color, because, of, the, beta, carotene, availability, in, their, food, while, the, lesser, flamingos, are, a, paler, pink, due, to, ingesting, a, smaller, amount, of, this, pigment, these, carotenoids, are, broken, down, into, pigments, by, liver, enzymes, the, source, of, this, varies, by, species, and, affects, the, color, saturation, flamingos, whose, sole, diet, is, blue, green, algae, are, darker, than, those, that, get, it, second, hand, by, eating, animals, that, have, digested, blue, green, algae, though, flamingos, prefer, to, drink, freshwater, they, are, equipped, with, glands, under, their, eyes, that, remove, extra, salt, from, their, bodies, this, organ, allows, them, to, drink, saltwater, as, well, flamingos, are, considered, very, noisy, birds, with, their, noises, and, vocalizations, ranging, from, grunting, or, growling, to, nasal, honking, vocalizations, play, an, important, role, in, parent, chick, recognition, ritualized, displays, and, keeping, large, flocks, together, variations, in, vocalizations, exist, in, the, voices, of, different, species, of, flamingos, flamingos, are, very, social, birds, they, live, in, colonies, whose, population, can, number, in, the, thousands, these, large, colonies, are, believed, to, serve, three, purposes, for, the, flamingos, avoiding, predators, maximizing, food, intake, and, using, scarce, suitable, nesting, sites, more, efficiently, before, breeding, flamingo, colonies, split, into, breeding, groups, of, about, 15, to, 50, birds, both, males, and, females, in, these, groups, perform, synchronized, ritual, displays, the, members, of, a, group, stand, together, and, display, to, each, other, by, stretching, their, necks, upwards, then, uttering, calls, while, head, flagging, and, then, flapping, their, wings, the, displays, do, not, seem, directed, towards, an, individual, but, occur, randomly, these, displays, stimulate, synchronous, nesting, see, below, and, help, pair, up, those, birds, that, do, not, already, have, mates, flamingos, form, strong, pair, bonds, although, in, larger, colonies, flamingos, sometimes, change, mates, presumably, because, more, mates, are, available, to, choose, flamingo, pairs, establish, and, defend, nesting, territories, they, locate, a, suitable, spot, on, the, mudflat, to, build, a, nest, the, female, usually, selects, the, place, copulation, usually, occurs, during, nest, building, which, is, sometimes, interrupted, by, another, flamingo, pair, trying, to, commandeer, the, nesting, site, for, their, use, flamingos, aggressively, defend, their, nesting, sites, both, the, male, and, the, female, contribute, to, building, the, nest, and, to, protecting, the, nest, and, egg, same, sex, pairs, have, been, reported, after, the, chicks, hatch, the, only, parental, expense, is, feeding, both, the, male, and, the, female, feed, their, chicks, with, a, kind, of, crop, milk, produced, in, glands, lining, the, whole, of, the, upper, digestive, tract, not, just, the, crop, the, hormone, prolactin, stimulates, production, crop, milk, contains, both, fat, and, protein, as, with, mammalian, milk, but, unlike, mammalian, milk, it, contains, no, carbohydrates, pigeons, and, doves, also, produce, crop, milk, though, just, in, the, glands, lining, the, crop, which, contains, less, fat, and, more, protein, than, flamingo, crop, milk, for, the, first, six, days, after, the, chicks, hatch, the, adults, and, chicks, stay, in, the, nesting, sites, at, around, 7, 12, days, old, the, chicks, begin, to, move, out, of, their, nests, and, explore, their, surroundings, when, they, are, two, weeks, old, the, chicks, congregate, in, groups, called, microcr, ches, and, their, parents, leave, them, alone, after, a, while, the, microcr, ches, merge, into, cr, ches, containing, thousands, of, chicks, chicks, that, do, not, stay, in, their, cr, ches, are, vulnerable, to, predators, when, young, flamingos, are, around, three, to, three, and, a, half, months, old, their, flight, feathers, will, finish, growing, in, allowing, them, to, fly, the, first, flamingo, hatched, in, a, european, zoo, was, a, chilean, flamingo, at, zoo, basel, in, switzerland, in, 1958, since, then, over, 389, flamingos, have, grown, up, in, basel, and, been, distributed, to, other, zoos, around, the, globe, greater, an, at, least, 83, year, old, greater, flamingo, believed, to, be, the, oldest, in, the, world, died, at, the, adelaide, zoo, in, australia, in, january, 2014, zoos, have, used, mirrors, to, improve, flamingo, breeding, behaviour, the, mirrors, are, thought, to, give, the, flamingos, the, impression, that, they, are, in, a, larger, flock, than, they, actually, are, while, many, different, kinds, of, birds, were, valued, items, in, roman, food, flamingos, were, among, the, most, prized, in, ancient, roman, cuisine, an, early, reference, to, their, consumption, and, especially, of, their, tongues, is, found, in, pliny, the, elder, who, states, in, the, natural, history, latin, phoenicopteri, linguam, praecipui, saporis, esse, apicius, docuit, nepotum, omnium, altissimus, gurges, apicius, that, very, deepest, whirlpool, of, all, our, epicures, has, informed, us, that, the, tongue, of, the, ph, nicopterus, is, of, the, most, exquisite, flavour, although, a, few, recipes, for, flamingos, are, found, in, apicius, extant, works, none, refer, specifically, to, flamingo, tongues, the, three, flamingo, recipes, in, the, de, re, coquinaria, on, the, subject, of, cooking, involve, the, whole, creature, suetonius, mentions, flamingo, tongues, in, his, life, of, vitellius, most, notorious, of, all, was, the, dinner, given, by, his, brother, to, celebrate, the, emperor, s, arrival, in, rome, at, which, two, thousand, of, the, choicest, fishes, and, seven, thousand, birds, are, said, to, have, been, served, he, himself, eclipsed, even, this, at, the, dedication, of, a, platter, which, on, account, of, its, enormous, size, he, called, the, shield, of, minerva, defender, of, the, city, in, this, he, mingled, the, livers, of, pike, the, brains, of, pheasants, and, peacocks, the, tongues, of, flamingoes, and, the, milt, of, lampreys, brought, by, his, captains, and, triremes, from, the, whole, empire, from, parthia, to, the, spanish, strait, martial, the, poet, devoted, an, ironic, epigram, alluding, to, flamingo, tongues, latin, dat, mihi, penna, rubens, nomen, sed, lingua, gulosis, nostra, sapit, quid, si, garrula, lingua, foret, my, red, wing, gives, me, my, name, but, it, is, my, tongue, that, is, considered, savoury, by, epicures, what, if, my, tongue, had, been, able, to, sing, there, is, also, a, mention, of, flamingo, brains, in, a, later, highly, contentious, source, detailing, in, the, life, of, elagabalus, a, food, item, not, apparently, to, his, liking, as, much, as, camels, heels, and, parrot, tongues, in, the, belief, that, the, latter, was, a, prophylactic, in, imitation, of, apicius, he, frequently, ate, camels, heels, and, also, cocks, combs, taken, from, the, living, birds, and, the, tongues, of, peacocks, and, nightingales, because, he, was, told, that, one, who, ate, them, was, immune, from, the, plague, he, served, to, the, palace, attendants, moreover, huge, platters, heaped, up, with, the, viscera, of, mullets, and, flamingo, brains, partridge, eggs, thrush, brains, and, the, heads, of, parrots, pheasants, and, peacocks
