fertilisation, or, fertilization, see, spelling, differences, also, known, as, generative, fertilisation, syngamy, and, impregnation, is, the, fusion, of, gametes, to, give, rise, to, a, zygote, and, initiate, its, development, into, a, new, individual, organism, or, offspring, while, processes, such, as, insemination, or, pollination, which, happen, before, the, fusion, of, gametes, are, also, sometimes, informally, referred, to, as, fertilisation, these, are, technically, separate, processes, the, cycle, of, fertilisation, and, development, of, new, individuals, is, called, sexual, reproduction, during, double, fertilisation, in, angiosperms, the, haploid, male, gamete, combines, with, two, haploid, polar, nuclei, to, form, a, triploid, primary, endosperm, nucleus, by, the, process, of, vegetative, fertilisation, in, antiquity, aristotle, conceived, the, formation, of, new, individuals, through, fusion, of, male, and, female, fluids, with, form, and, function, emerging, gradually, in, a, mode, called, by, him, as, epigenetic, in, 1784, spallanzani, established, the, need, of, interaction, between, the, female, s, ovum, and, male, s, sperm, to, form, a, zygote, in, frogs, in, 1827, karl, ernst, von, baer, observed, a, therian, mammalian, egg, for, the, first, time, oscar, hertwig, 1876, in, germany, described, the, fusion, of, nuclei, of, spermatozoa, and, of, ova, from, sea, urchin, the, evolution, of, fertilisation, is, related, to, the, origin, of, meiosis, as, both, are, part, of, sexual, reproduction, originated, in, eukaryotes, one, hypothesis, states, that, meiosis, originated, from, mitosis, the, gametes, that, participate, in, fertilisation, of, plants, are, the, sperm, male, and, the, egg, female, cell, various, plant, groups, have, differing, methods, by, which, the, gametes, produced, by, the, male, and, female, gametophytes, come, together, and, are, fertilised, in, bryophytes, and, pteridophytic, land, plants, fertilisation, of, the, sperm, and, egg, takes, place, within, the, archegonium, in, seed, plants, the, male, gametophyte, is, formed, within, a, pollen, grain, after, pollination, the, pollen, grain, germinates, and, a, pollen, tube, grows, and, penetrates, the, ovule, through, a, tiny, pore, called, a, micropyle, the, sperm, are, transferred, from, the, pollen, through, the, pollen, tube, to, the, ovule, where, the, egg, is, fertilised, in, flowering, plants, two, sperm, cells, are, released, from, the, pollen, tube, and, a, second, fertilisation, event, occurs, involving, the, second, sperm, cell, and, the, central, cell, of, the, ovule, which, is, a, second, female, gamete, unlike, animal, sperm, which, is, motile, the, sperm, of, most, seed, plants, is, immotile, and, relies, on, the, pollen, tube, to, carry, it, to, the, ovule, where, the, sperm, is, released, the, pollen, tube, penetrates, the, stigma, and, elongates, through, the, extracellular, matrix, of, the, style, before, reaching, the, ovary, then, near, the, receptacle, it, breaks, through, the, ovule, through, the, micropyle, an, opening, in, the, ovule, wall, and, the, pollen, tube, bursts, into, the, embryo, sac, releasing, sperm, the, growth, of, the, pollen, tube, has, been, believed, to, depend, on, chemical, cues, from, the, pistil, however, these, mechanisms, were, poorly, understood, until, 1995, work, done, on, tobacco, plants, revealed, a, family, of, glycoproteins, called, tts, proteins, that, enhanced, growth, of, pollen, tubes, pollen, tubes, in, a, sugar, free, pollen, germination, medium, and, a, medium, with, purified, tts, proteins, both, grew, however, in, the, tts, medium, the, tubes, grew, at, a, rate, 3x, that, of, the, sugar, free, medium, tts, proteins, were, also, placed, on, various, locations, of, semi, in, vivo, pollinated, pistils, and, pollen, tubes, were, observed, to, immediately, extend, toward, the, proteins, transgenic, plants, lacking, the, ability, to, produce, tts, proteins, had, slower, pollen, tube, growth, and, reduced, fertility, the, rupture, of, the, pollen, tube, to, release, sperm, in, arabidopsis, has, been, shown, to, depend, on, a, signal, from, the, female, gametophyte, specific, proteins, called, fer, protein, kinases, present, in, the, ovule, control, the, production, of, highly, reactive, derivatives, of, oxygen, called, reactive, oxygen, species, ros, ros, levels, have, been, shown, via, gfp, to, be, at, their, highest, during, floral, stages, when, the, ovule, is, the, most, receptive, to, pollen, tubes, and, lowest, during, times, of, development, and, following, fertilisation, high, amounts, of, ros, activate, calcium, ion, channels, in, the, pollen, tube, causing, these, channels, to, take, up, calcium, ions, in, large, amounts, this, increased, uptake, of, calcium, causes, the, pollen, tube, to, rupture, and, release, its, sperm, into, the, ovule, pistil, feeding, assays, in, which, plants, were, fed, diphenyl, iodonium, chloride, dpi, suppressed, ros, concentrations, in, arabidopsis, which, in, turn, prevented, pollen, tube, rupture, after, being, fertilised, the, ovary, starts, to, swell, and, develop, into, the, fruit, with, multi, seeded, fruits, multiple, grains, of, pollen, are, necessary, for, syngamy, with, each, ovule, the, growth, of, the, pollen, tube, is, controlled, by, the, vegetative, or, tube, cytoplasm, hydrolytic, enzymes, are, secreted, by, the, pollen, tube, that, digest, the, female, tissue, as, the, tube, grows, down, the, stigma, and, style, the, digested, tissue, is, used, as, a, nutrient, source, for, the, pollen, tube, as, it, grows, during, pollen, tube, growth, towards, the, ovary, the, generative, nucleus, divides, to, produce, two, separate, sperm, nuclei, haploid, number, of, chromosomes, a, growing, pollen, tube, therefore, contains, three, separate, nuclei, two, sperm, and, one, tube, the, sperms, are, interconnected, and, dimorphic, the, large, one, in, a, number, of, plants, is, also, linked, to, the, tube, nucleus, and, the, interconnected, sperm, and, the, tube, nucleus, form, the, male, germ, unit, double, fertilisation, is, the, process, in, angiosperms, flowering, plants, in, which, two, sperm, from, each, pollen, tube, fertilise, two, cells, in, a, female, gametophyte, sometimes, called, an, embryo, sac, that, is, inside, an, ovule, after, the, pollen, tube, enters, the, gametophyte, the, pollen, tube, nucleus, disintegrates, and, the, two, sperm, cells, are, released, one, of, the, two, sperm, cells, fertilises, the, egg, cell, at, the, bottom, of, the, gametophyte, near, the, micropyle, forming, a, diploid, 2n, zygote, this, is, the, point, when, fertilisation, actually, occurs, pollination, and, fertilisation, are, two, separate, processes, the, nucleus, of, the, other, sperm, cell, fuses, with, two, haploid, polar, nuclei, contained, in, the, central, cell, in, the, centre, of, the, gametophyte, the, resulting, cell, is, triploid, 3n, this, triploid, cell, divides, through, mitosis, and, forms, the, endosperm, a, nutrient, rich, tissue, inside, the, seed, the, two, central, cell, maternal, nuclei, polar, nuclei, that, contribute, to, the, endosperm, arise, by, mitosis, from, the, single, meiotic, product, that, also, gave, rise, to, the, egg, therefore, maternal, contribution, to, the, genetic, constitution, of, the, triploid, endosperm, is, double, that, of, the, embryo, one, primitive, species, of, flowering, plant, nuphar, polysepala, has, endosperm, that, is, diploid, resulting, from, the, fusion, of, a, sperm, with, one, rather, than, two, maternal, nuclei, it, is, believed, that, early, in, the, development, of, angiosperm, lineages, there, was, a, duplication, in, this, mode, of, reproduction, producing, seven, celled, eight, nucleate, female, gametophytes, and, triploid, endosperms, with, a, 2, 1, maternal, to, paternal, genome, ratio, in, many, plants, the, development, of, the, flesh, of, the, fruit, is, proportional, to, the, percentage, of, fertilised, ovules, for, example, with, watermelon, about, a, thousand, grains, of, pollen, must, be, delivered, and, spread, evenly, on, the, three, lobes, of, the, stigma, to, make, a, normal, sized, and, shaped, fruit, outcrossing, or, cross, fertilisation, and, self, fertilisation, represent, different, strategies, with, differing, benefits, and, costs, an, estimated, 48, 7, of, plant, species, are, either, dioecious, or, self, incompatible, obligate, outcrossers, it, is, also, estimated, that, about, 42, of, flowering, plants, exhibit, a, mixed, mating, system, in, nature, in, the, most, common, kind, of, mixed, mating, system, individual, plants, produce, a, single, type, of, flower, and, fruits, may, contain, self, fertilised, outcrossed, or, a, mixture, of, progeny, types, the, transition, from, cross, fertilisation, to, self, fertilisation, is, the, most, common, evolutionary, transition, in, plants, and, has, occurred, repeatedly, in, many, independent, lineages, about, 10, 15, of, flowering, plants, are, predominantly, self, fertilising, under, circumstances, where, pollinators, or, mates, are, rare, self, fertilisation, offers, the, advantage, of, reproductive, assurance, self, fertilisation, can, therefore, result, in, improved, colonisation, ability, in, some, species, self, fertilisation, has, persisted, over, many, generations, capsella, rubella, is, a, self, fertilising, species, that, became, self, compatible, 50, 000, to, 100, 000, years, ago, arabidopsis, thaliana, is, a, predominantly, self, fertilising, plant, with, an, out, crossing, rate, in, the, wild, of, less, than, 0, 3, a, study, suggested, that, self, fertilisation, evolved, roughly, a, million, years, ago, or, more, in, a, thaliana, in, long, established, self, fertilising, plants, the, masking, of, deleterious, mutations, and, the, production, of, genetic, variability, is, infrequent, and, thus, unlikely, to, provide, a, sufficient, benefit, over, many, generations, to, maintain, the, meiotic, apparatus, consequently, one, might, expect, self, fertilisation, to, be, replaced, in, nature, by, an, ameiotic, asexual, form, of, reproduction, that, would, be, less, costly, however, the, actual, persistence, of, meiosis, and, self, fertilisation, as, a, form, of, reproduction, in, long, established, self, fertilising, plants, may, be, related, to, the, immediate, benefit, of, efficient, recombinational, repair, of, dna, damage, during, formation, of, germ, cells, provided, by, meiosis, at, each, generation, the, mechanics, behind, fertilisation, has, been, studied, extensively, in, sea, urchins, and, mice, this, research, addresses, the, question, of, how, the, sperm, and, the, appropriate, egg, find, each, other, and, the, question, of, how, only, one, sperm, gets, into, the, egg, and, delivers, its, contents, there, are, three, steps, to, fertilisation, that, ensure, species, specificity, consideration, as, to, whether, an, animal, more, specifically, a, vertebrate, uses, internal, or, external, fertilisation, is, often, dependent, on, the, method, of, birth, oviparous, animals, laying, eggs, with, thick, calcium, shells, such, as, chickens, or, thick, leathery, shells, generally, reproduce, via, internal, fertilisation, so, that, the, sperm, fertilises, the, egg, without, having, to, pass, through, the, thick, protective, tertiary, layer, of, the, egg, ovoviviparous, and, viviparous, animals, also, use, internal, fertilisation, although, some, organisms, reproduce, via, amplexus, they, may, still, use, internal, fertilisation, as, with, some, salamanders, advantages, of, internal, fertilisation, include, minimal, waste, of, gametes, greater, chance, of, individual, egg, fertilisation, longer, period, of, egg, protection, and, selective, fertilisation, many, females, have, the, ability, to, store, sperm, for, extended, periods, of, time, and, can, fertilise, their, eggs, at, their, own, desire, oviparous, animals, producing, eggs, with, thin, tertiary, membranes, or, no, membranes, at, all, on, the, other, hand, use, external, fertilisation, methods, such, animals, may, be, more, precisely, termed, ovuliparous, external, fertilisation, is, advantageous, in, that, it, minimises, contact, which, decreases, the, risk, of, disease, transmission, and, greater, genetic, variation, sperm, find, the, eggs, via, chemotaxis, a, type, of, ligand, receptor, interaction, resact, is, a, 14, amino, acid, peptide, purified, from, the, jelly, coat, of, a, punctulata, that, attracts, the, migration, of, sperm, after, finding, the, egg, the, sperm, penetrates, the, jelly, coat, through, a, process, called, sperm, activation, in, another, ligand, receptor, interaction, an, oligosaccharide, component, of, the, egg, binds, and, activates, a, receptor, on, the, sperm, and, causes, the, acrosomal, reaction, the, acrosomal, vesicles, of, the, sperm, fuse, with, the, plasma, membrane, and, are, released, in, this, process, molecules, bound, to, the, acrosomal, vesicle, membrane, such, as, bindin, are, exposed, on, the, surface, of, the, sperm, these, contents, digest, the, jelly, coat, and, eventually, the, vitelline, membrane, in, addition, to, the, release, of, acrosomal, vesicles, there, is, explosive, polymerisation, of, actin, to, form, a, thin, spike, at, the, head, of, the, sperm, called, the, acrosomal, process, the, sperm, binds, to, the, egg, through, another, ligand, reaction, between, receptors, on, the, vitelline, membrane, the, sperm, surface, protein, bindin, binds, to, a, receptor, on, the, vitelline, membrane, identified, as, ebr1, fusion, of, the, plasma, membranes, of, the, sperm, and, egg, are, likely, mediated, by, bindin, at, the, site, of, contact, fusion, causes, the, formation, of, a, fertilisation, cone, mammals, internally, fertilise, through, copulation, after, a, male, ejaculates, many, sperm, move, to, the, upper, vagina, via, contractions, from, the, vagina, through, the, cervix, and, across, the, length, of, the, uterus, to, meet, the, ovum, in, cases, where, fertilisation, occurs, the, female, usually, ovulates, during, a, period, that, extends, from, hours, before, copulation, to, a, few, days, after, therefore, in, most, mammals, it, is, more, common, for, ejaculation, to, precede, ovulation, than, vice, versa, when, sperm, are, deposited, into, the, anterior, vagina, they, are, not, capable, of, fertilisation, i, e, non, capacitated, and, are, characterised, by, slow, linear, motility, patterns, this, motility, combined, with, muscular, contractions, enables, sperm, transport, towards, the, uterus, and, oviducts, there, is, a, ph, gradient, within, the, micro, environment, of, the, female, reproductive, tract, such, that, the, ph, near, the, vaginal, opening, is, lower, approximately, 5, than, the, oviducts, approximately, 8, the, sperm, specific, ph, sensitive, calcium, transport, protein, called, catsper, increases, the, sperm, cell, permeability, to, calcium, as, it, moves, further, into, the, reproductive, tract, intracellular, calcium, influx, contributes, to, sperm, capacitation, and, hyperactivation, causing, a, more, violent, and, rapid, non, linear, motility, pattern, as, sperm, approach, the, oocyte, the, capacitated, spermatozoon, and, the, oocyte, meet, and, interact, in, the, ampulla, of, the, fallopian, tube, rheotaxis, thermotaxis, and, chemotaxis, are, known, mechanisms, that, guide, sperm, towards, the, egg, during, the, final, stage, of, sperm, migration, spermatozoa, respond, see, sperm, thermotaxis, to, the, temperature, gradient, of, 2, c, between, the, oviduct, and, the, ampulla, and, chemotactic, gradients, of, progesterone, have, been, confirmed, as, the, signal, emanating, from, the, cumulus, oophorus, cells, surrounding, rabbit, and, human, oocytes, capacitated, and, hyperactivated, sperm, respond, to, these, gradients, by, changing, their, behaviour, and, moving, towards, the, cumulus, oocyte, complex, other, chemotactic, signals, such, as, formyl, met, leu, phe, fmlf, may, also, guide, spermatozoa, the, zona, pellucida, a, thick, layer, of, extracellular, matrix, that, surrounds, the, egg, and, is, similar, to, the, role, of, the, vitelline, membrane, in, sea, urchins, binds, the, sperm, unlike, sea, urchins, the, sperm, binds, to, the, egg, before, the, acrosomal, reaction, zp3, a, glycoprotein, in, the, zona, pellucida, is, responsible, for, egg, sperm, adhesion, in, humans, the, receptor, galactosyltransferase, galt, binds, to, the, n, acetylglucosamine, residues, on, the, zp3, and, is, important, for, binding, with, the, sperm, and, activating, the, acrosome, reaction, zp3, is, sufficient, though, unnecessary, for, sperm, egg, binding, two, additional, sperm, receptors, exist, a, 250kd, protein, that, binds, to, an, oviduct, secreted, protein, and, sed1, which, independently, binds, to, the, zona, after, the, acrosome, reaction, the, sperm, is, believed, to, remain, bound, to, the, zona, pellucida, through, exposed, zp2, receptors, these, receptors, are, unknown, in, mice, but, have, been, identified, in, guinea, pigs, in, mammals, the, binding, of, the, spermatozoon, to, the, galt, initiates, the, acrosome, reaction, this, process, releases, the, hyaluronidase, that, digests, the, matrix, of, hyaluronic, acid, in, the, vestments, around, the, oocyte, additionally, heparin, like, glycosaminoglycans, gags, are, released, near, the, oocyte, that, promote, the, acrosome, reaction, fusion, between, the, oocyte, plasma, membranes, and, sperm, follows, and, allows, the, sperm, nucleus, the, typical, centriole, and, atypical, centriole, that, is, attached, to, the, flagellum, but, not, the, mitochondria, to, enter, the, oocyte, the, protein, cd9, likely, mediates, this, fusion, in, mice, the, binding, homolog, the, egg, activates, itself, upon, fusing, with, a, single, sperm, cell, and, thereby, changes, its, cell, membrane, to, prevent, fusion, with, other, sperm, zinc, atoms, are, released, during, this, activation, this, process, ultimately, leads, to, the, formation, of, a, diploid, cell, called, a, zygote, the, zygote, divides, to, form, a, blastocyst, and, upon, entering, the, uterus, implants, in, the, endometrium, beginning, pregnancy, embryonic, implantation, not, in, the, uterine, wall, results, in, an, ectopic, pregnancy, that, can, kill, the, mother, in, such, animals, as, rabbits, coitus, induces, ovulation, by, stimulating, the, release, of, the, pituitary, hormone, gonadotropin, this, release, greatly, increases, the, likelihood, of, pregnancy, fertilisation, in, humans, is, the, union, of, a, human, egg, and, sperm, usually, occurring, in, the, ampulla, of, the, fallopian, tube, producing, a, single, celled, zygote, the, first, stage, of, life, in, the, development, of, a, genetically, unique, organism, and, initiating, embryonic, development, scientists, discovered, the, dynamics, of, human, fertilisation, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, term, conception, commonly, refers, to, the, process, of, becoming, pregnant, involving, fertilisation, or, implantation, or, both, its, use, makes, it, a, subject, of, semantic, arguments, about, the, beginning, of, pregnancy, typically, in, the, context, of, the, abortion, debate, upon, gastrulation, which, occurs, around, 16, days, after, fertilisation, the, implanted, blastocyst, develops, three, germ, layers, the, endoderm, the, ectoderm, and, the, mesoderm, and, the, genetic, code, of, the, father, becomes, fully, involved, in, the, development, of, the, embryo, later, twinning, is, impossible, additionally, interspecies, hybrids, survive, only, until, gastrulation, and, cannot, further, develop, however, some, human, developmental, biology, literature, refers, to, the, conceptus, and, such, medical, literature, refers, to, the, products, of, conception, as, the, post, implantation, embryo, and, its, surrounding, membranes, the, term, conception, is, not, usually, used, in, scientific, literature, because, of, its, variable, definition, and, connotation, insects, in, different, groups, including, the, odonata, dragonflies, and, damselflies, and, the, hymenoptera, ants, bees, and, wasps, practise, delayed, fertilisation, among, the, odonata, females, may, mate, with, multiple, males, and, store, sperm, until, the, eggs, are, laid, the, male, may, hover, above, the, female, during, egg, laying, oviposition, to, prevent, her, from, mating, with, other, males, and, replacing, his, sperm, in, some, groups, such, as, the, darters, the, male, continues, to, grasp, the, female, with, his, claspers, during, egg, laying, the, pair, flying, around, in, tandem, among, social, hymenoptera, honeybee, queens, mate, only, on, mating, flights, in, a, short, period, lasting, some, days, a, queen, may, mate, with, eight, or, more, drones, she, then, stores, the, sperm, for, the, rest, of, her, life, perhaps, for, five, years, or, more, in, many, fungi, except, chytrids, as, in, some, protists, fertilisation, is, a, two, step, process, first, the, cytoplasms, of, the, two, gamete, cells, fuse, called, plasmogamy, producing, a, dikaryotic, or, heterokaryotic, cell, with, multiple, nuclei, this, cell, may, then, divide, to, produce, dikaryotic, or, heterokaryotic, hyphae, the, second, step, of, fertilisation, is, karyogamy, the, fusion, of, the, nuclei, to, form, a, diploid, zygote, in, chytrid, fungi, fertilisation, occurs, in, a, single, step, with, the, fusion, of, gametes, as, in, animals, and, plants, there, are, three, types, of, fertilisation, processes, in, protozoa, algae, like, some, land, plants, undergo, alternation, of, generations, some, algae, are, isomorphic, where, both, the, sporophyte, 2n, and, gameteophyte, n, are, the, same, morphologically, when, algae, reproduction, is, described, as, oogamous, the, male, and, female, gametes, are, different, morphologically, where, there, is, a, large, non, motile, egg, for, female, gametes, and, the, male, gamete, are, uniflagellate, motile, via, the, process, of, syngamy, these, will, form, a, new, zygote, regenerating, the, sporophyte, generation, again, meiosis, results, in, a, random, segregation, of, the, genes, that, each, parent, contributes, each, parent, organism, is, usually, identical, save, for, a, fraction, of, their, genes, each, gamete, is, therefore, genetically, unique, at, fertilisation, parental, chromosomes, combine, in, humans, 2, 17, 6x10, 12, chromosomally, different, zygotes, are, possible, for, the, non, sex, chromosomes, even, assuming, no, chromosomal, crossover, if, crossover, occurs, once, then, on, average, 4, 309x10, 24, genetically, different, zygotes, are, possible, for, every, couple, not, considering, that, crossover, events, can, take, place, at, most, points, along, each, chromosome, the, x, and, y, chromosomes, undergo, no, crossover, events, and, are, therefore, excluded, from, the, calculation, the, mitochondrial, dna, is, only, inherited, from, the, maternal, parent, shortly, after, the, sperm, fuse, with, the, egg, the, two, sperm, centrioles, form, the, embryo, first, centrosome, and, microtubule, aster, the, sperm, centriole, found, near, the, male, pronucleus, recruit, egg, pericentriolar, material, proteins, forming, the, zygote, first, centrosome, this, centrosome, nucleates, microtubules, in, the, shape, of, stars, called, astral, microtubules, the, microtubules, span, the, whole, valium, of, the, egg, allowing, the, egg, pronucleus, to, use, the, cables, to, get, to, the, male, pronucleus, as, the, male, and, female, pronuclei, approach, each, other, the, single, centrosome, split, into, two, centrosomes, located, in, the, interphase, between, the, pronuclei, then, the, centrosome, via, the, astral, microtubules, polarises, the, genome, inside, the, pronuclei, organisms, that, normally, reproduce, sexually, can, also, reproduce, via, parthenogenesis, wherein, an, unfertilised, female, gamete, produces, viable, offspring, these, offspring, may, be, clones, of, the, mother, or, in, some, cases, genetically, differ, from, her, but, inherit, only, part, of, her, dna, parthenogenesis, occurs, in, many, plants, and, animals, and, may, be, induced, in, others, through, a, chemical, or, electrical, stimulus, to, the, egg, cell, in, 2004, japanese, researchers, led, by, tomohiro, kono, succeeded, after, 457, attempts, to, merge, the, ova, of, two, mice, by, blocking, certain, proteins, that, would, normally, prevent, the, possibility, the, resulting, embryo, normally, developed, into, a, mouse, allogamy, which, is, also, known, as, cross, fertilisation, refers, to, the, fertilisation, of, an, egg, cell, from, one, individual, with, the, male, gamete, of, another, autogamy, which, is, also, known, as, self, fertilisation, occurs, in, such, hermaphroditic, organisms, as, plants, and, flatworms, therein, two, gametes, from, one, individual, fuse, some, relatively, unusual, forms, of, reproduction, are, gynogenesis, a, sperm, stimulates, the, egg, to, develop, without, fertilisation, or, syngamy, the, sperm, may, enter, the, egg, hybridogenesis, one, genome, is, eliminated, to, produce, haploid, eggs, canina, meiosis, sometimes, called, permanent, odd, polyploidy, one, genome, is, transmitted, in, the, mendelian, fashion, others, are, transmitted, clonally, the, major, benefit, of, cross, fertilisation, is, generally, thought, to, be, the, avoidance, of, inbreeding, depression, charles, darwin, in, his, 1876, book, the, effects, of, cross, and, self, fertilisation, in, the, vegetable, kingdom, pages, 466, 467, summed, up, his, findings, in, the, following, way, it, has, been, shown, in, the, present, volume, that, the, offspring, from, the, union, of, two, distinct, individuals, especially, if, their, progenitors, have, been, subjected, to, very, different, conditions, have, an, immense, advantage, in, height, weight, constitutional, vigour, and, fertility, over, the, self, fertilised, offspring, from, one, of, the, same, parents, and, this, fact, is, amply, sufficient, to, account, for, the, development, of, the, sexual, elements, that, is, for, the, genesis, of, the, two, sexes, in, addition, it, is, thought, by, some, that, a, long, term, advantage, of, out, crossing, in, nature, is, increased, genetic, variability, that, promotes, adaptation, or, avoidance, of, extinction, see, genetic, variability
