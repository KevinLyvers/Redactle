broccoli, brassica, oleracea, var, italica, is, an, edible, green, plant, in, the, cabbage, family, family, brassicaceae, genus, brassica, whose, large, flowering, head, stalk, and, small, associated, leaves, are, eaten, as, a, vegetable, broccoli, is, classified, in, the, italica, cultivar, group, of, the, species, brassica, oleracea, broccoli, has, large, flower, heads, or, florets, usually, dark, green, arranged, in, a, tree, like, structure, branching, out, from, a, thick, stalk, which, is, usually, light, green, the, mass, of, flower, heads, is, surrounded, by, leaves, broccoli, resembles, cauliflower, which, is, a, different, but, closely, related, cultivar, group, of, the, same, brassica, species, it, can, be, eaten, either, raw, or, cooked, broccoli, is, a, particularly, rich, source, of, vitamin, c, and, vitamin, k, contents, of, its, characteristic, sulfur, containing, glucosinolate, compounds, isothiocyanates, and, sulforaphane, are, diminished, by, boiling, but, are, better, preserved, by, steaming, microwaving, or, stir, frying, rapini, sometimes, called, broccoli, rabe, is, a, distinct, species, from, broccoli, forming, similar, but, smaller, heads, and, is, actually, a, type, of, turnip, brassica, rapa, brassica, oleracea, var, italica, was, described, in, 1794, by, joseph, jakob, von, plenck, in, icones, plantarum, medicinalium, 6, 29, t, 534, like, all, the, other, brassicas, broccoli, was, developed, from, the, wild, cabbage, brassica, oleracea, var, oleracea, also, called, colewort, or, field, cabbage, the, word, broccoli, first, used, in, the, 17th, century, comes, from, the, italian, plural, of, broccolo, which, means, the, flowering, crest, of, a, cabbage, and, is, the, diminutive, form, of, brocco, meaning, small, nail, or, sprout, broccoli, resulted, from, the, breeding, of, landrace, brassica, crops, in, the, northern, mediterranean, starting, in, about, the, sixth, century, bce, broccoli, has, its, origins, in, primitive, cultivars, grown, in, the, roman, empire, and, was, most, likely, improved, via, artificial, selection, in, the, southern, italian, peninsula, or, in, sicily, broccoli, was, spread, to, northern, europe, by, the, 18th, century, and, brought, to, north, america, in, the, 19th, century, by, italian, immigrants, after, the, second, world, war, the, breeding, of, the, united, states, and, japanese, f1, hybrids, increased, yields, quality, growth, speed, and, regional, adaptation, which, produced, the, cultivars, commonly, grown, since, then, premium, crop, packman, and, marathon, broccoli, is, an, annual, plant, which, can, grow, up, to, 60, 90, cm, 20, 40, in, tall, broccoli, is, very, similar, to, cauliflower, but, unlike, it, its, floral, buds, are, well, formed, and, clearly, visible, the, inflorescence, grows, at, the, end, of, a, central, thick, stem, and, is, dark, green, violet, yellow, or, even, white, heads, have, been, created, but, these, varieties, are, rare, the, flowers, are, yellow, with, four, petals, the, growth, season, for, broccoli, is, 14, 15, weeks, broccoli, is, collected, by, hand, immediately, after, the, head, is, fully, formed, yet, the, flowers, are, still, in, their, bud, stage, the, plant, develops, numerous, little, heads, from, the, lateral, shoots, which, can, be, harvested, later, there, are, three, commonly, grown, types, of, broccoli, the, most, familiar, is, calabrese, broccoli, often, referred, to, simply, as, broccoli, named, after, calabria, in, italy, it, has, large, 10, to, 20, centimetre, 4, 8, in, green, heads, and, thick, stalks, it, is, a, cool, season, annual, crop, sprouting, broccoli, white, or, purple, has, a, larger, number, of, heads, with, many, thin, stalks, purple, cauliflower, or, violet, cauliflower, is, a, type, of, broccoli, grown, in, europe, and, north, america, it, has, a, head, shaped, like, cauliflower, but, consists, of, many, tiny, flower, buds, it, sometimes, but, not, always, has, a, purple, cast, to, the, tips, of, the, flower, buds, purple, cauliflower, may, also, be, white, red, green, or, other, colors, benefort, is, a, variety, of, broccoli, containing, 2, 3, times, more, glucoraphanin, and, produced, by, crossing, broccoli, with, a, wild, brassica, variety, brassica, oleracea, var, villosa, other, cultivar, groups, of, brassica, oleracea, include, cabbage, capitata, group, cauliflower, and, romanesco, broccoli, botrytis, group, kale, acephala, group, collard, viridis, group, kohlrabi, gongylodes, group, brussels, sprouts, gemmifera, group, and, kai, lan, alboglabra, group, as, these, groups, are, the, same, species, they, readily, hybridize, for, example, broccolini, or, tenderstem, broccoli, is, a, cross, between, broccoli, and, kai, lan, broccoli, cultivars, form, the, genetic, basis, of, the, tropical, cauliflowers, commonly, grown, in, south, and, southeastern, asia, although, they, produce, a, more, cauliflower, like, head, in, warmer, conditions, the, majority, of, broccoli, cultivars, are, cool, weather, crops, that, do, poorly, in, hot, summer, weather, broccoli, grows, best, when, exposed, to, an, average, daily, temperature, between, 18, and, 23, c, 64, and, 73, f, when, the, cluster, of, flowers, also, referred, to, as, a, head, of, broccoli, appears, in, the, center, of, the, plant, the, cluster, is, generally, green, garden, pruners, or, shears, are, used, to, cut, the, head, about, 25, mm, 1, in, from, the, tip, broccoli, should, be, harvested, before, the, flowers, on, the, head, bloom, bright, yellow, broccoli, cannot, be, harvested, using, machines, but, rather, is, hand, harvested, in, 2021, global, production, of, broccoli, combined, for, production, reports, with, cauliflowers, was, 26, million, tonnes, with, china, and, india, together, accounting, for, 72, of, the, world, total, secondary, producers, each, having, about, one, million, tonnes, or, less, annually, were, the, united, states, spain, and, mexico, table, in, the, united, states, broccoli, is, grown, year, round, in, california, which, produced, 92, of, the, crop, nationally, with, 95, of, the, total, crop, produced, for, fresh, sales, in, 2018, raw, broccoli, is, 89, water, 7, carbohydrates, 3, protein, and, contains, negligible, fat, table, a, 100, gram, 3, 1, 2, ounce, reference, amount, of, raw, broccoli, provides, 141, kilojoules, 34, kilocalories, of, food, energy, and, is, a, rich, source, 20, or, higher, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, vitamin, c, 107, dv, and, vitamin, k, 97, dv, table, raw, broccoli, also, contains, moderate, amounts, 10, 19, dv, of, several, b, vitamins, and, the, dietary, mineral, manganese, whereas, other, micronutrients, are, low, in, content, less, than, 10, dv, broccoli, contains, the, dietary, carotenoid, beta, carotene, boiling, substantially, reduces, the, levels, of, broccoli, glucosinolates, while, other, cooking, methods, such, as, steaming, microwaving, and, stir, frying, have, no, significant, effect, on, glucosinolate, levels, the, perceived, bitterness, of, cruciferous, vegetables, such, as, broccoli, results, from, glucosinolates, and, their, hydrolysis, products, particularly, isothiocyanates, and, other, sulfur, containing, compounds, preliminary, research, indicates, that, genetic, inheritance, through, the, gene, tas2r38, may, be, responsible, in, part, for, bitter, taste, perception, in, broccoli, the, larvae, of, pieris, rapae, also, known, as, the, small, white, butterfly, are, a, common, pest, in, broccoli, and, were, mostly, introduced, accidentally, to, north, america, australia, and, new, zealand, additional, pests, common, to, broccoli, production, include
