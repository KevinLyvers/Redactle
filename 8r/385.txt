dung, beetles, are, beetles, that, feed, on, feces, some, species, of, dung, beetles, can, bury, dung, 250, times, their, own, mass, in, one, night, many, dung, beetles, known, as, rollers, roll, dung, into, round, balls, which, are, used, as, a, food, source, or, breeding, chambers, other, dung, beetles, like, euoniticellus, intermedius, known, as, tunnelers, bury, the, dung, wherever, they, find, it, a, third, group, the, dwellers, neither, roll, nor, burrow, they, simply, live, in, dung, they, are, often, attracted, by, the, feces, collected, by, burrowing, owls, there, are, dung, beetle, species, of, various, colors, and, sizes, and, some, functional, traits, such, as, body, mass, or, biomass, and, leg, length, can, have, high, levels, of, variability, all, the, species, belong, to, the, superfamily, scarabaeoidea, most, of, them, to, the, subfamilies, scarabaeinae, and, aphodiinae, of, the, family, scarabaeidae, scarab, beetles, as, most, species, of, scarabaeinae, feed, exclusively, on, feces, that, subfamily, is, often, dubbed, true, dung, beetles, there, are, dung, feeding, beetles, which, belong, to, other, families, such, as, the, geotrupidae, the, earth, boring, dung, beetle, the, scarabaeinae, alone, comprises, more, than, 5, 000, species, the, nocturnal, african, dung, beetle, scarabaeus, satyrus, is, one, of, the, few, known, invertebrate, animals, that, navigate, and, orient, themselves, using, the, milky, way, the, daily, dung, of, one, elephant, can, support, 2, 000, 000, beetles, dung, beetles, are, not, a, single, taxonomic, group, dung, feeding, is, found, in, a, number, of, families, of, beetles, so, the, behaviour, cannot, be, assumed, to, have, evolved, only, once, dung, beetles, live, in, many, habitats, including, desert, grasslands, and, savannas, farmlands, and, native, and, planted, forests, they, are, highly, influenced, by, the, environmental, context, and, do, not, prefer, extremely, cold, or, dry, weather, they, are, found, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, they, eat, the, dung, of, herbivores, and, omnivores, and, prefer, that, produced, by, the, latter, many, of, them, also, feed, on, mushrooms, and, decaying, leaves, and, fruits, the, neotropical, deltochilum, valgum, d, kolbei, and, d, viridescens, are, carnivores, with, a, strong, preference, for, preying, upon, millipedes, two, other, species, from, brazil, canthon, dives, and, canthon, virens, prey, on, queens, and, other, winged, forms, of, leafcutter, ants, one, species, from, the, iberian, peninsula, thorectes, lusitanicus, feeds, on, acorns, dung, beetles, do, not, necessarily, have, to, eat, or, drink, anything, else, because, the, dung, provides, all, the, necessary, nutrients, most, dung, beetles, search, for, dung, using, their, sensitive, sense, of, smell, some, smaller, species, simply, attach, themselves, to, the, dung, providers, to, wait, for, the, dung, after, capturing, the, dung, a, dung, beetle, rolls, it, following, a, straight, line, despite, all, obstacles, sometimes, dung, beetles, try, to, steal, the, dung, ball, from, another, beetle, so, the, dung, beetles, have, to, move, rapidly, away, from, a, dung, pile, once, they, have, rolled, their, ball, to, prevent, it, from, being, stolen, dung, beetles, can, roll, up, to, 10, times, their, weight, male, onthophagus, taurus, beetles, can, pull, 1, 141, times, their, own, body, weight, the, equivalent, of, an, average, person, pulling, six, double, decker, buses, full, of, people, a, species, of, dung, beetle, the, african, scarabaeus, zambesianus, navigates, by, polarization, patterns, in, moonlight, the, first, animal, known, to, do, so, dung, beetles, can, also, navigate, when, only, the, milky, way, or, clusters, of, bright, stars, are, visible, making, them, the, only, insects, known, to, orient, themselves, by, the, milky, way, research, using, 1, kg, bolus, of, elephant, dung, found, that, a, larger, number, exploit, it, during, the, night, 13, 700, than, during, the, day, 3, 330, the, eyes, of, dung, beetles, are, superposition, compound, eyes, typical, of, many, scarabaeid, beetles, the, sequence, of, images, shows, a, sequence, of, the, beetle, rolling, a, dung, ball, it, does, this, to, navigate, cambefort, and, hanski, 1991, classified, dung, beetles, into, three, functional, types, based, on, their, feeding, and, nesting, strategies, such, as, rollers, tunnelers, and, dwellers, the, rollers, roll, and, bury, a, dung, ball, either, for, food, storage, or, for, making, a, brooding, ball, in, the, latter, case, two, beetles, one, male, and, one, female, stay, around, the, dung, ball, during, the, rolling, process, usually, it, is, the, male, that, rolls, the, ball, while, the, female, hitch, hikes, or, simply, follows, behind, in, some, cases, the, male, and, the, female, roll, together, when, a, spot, with, soft, soil, is, found, they, stop, and, bury, the, ball, then, mate, underground, after, the, mating, one, or, both, of, them, prepares, the, brooding, ball, when, the, ball, is, finished, the, female, lays, eggs, inside, it, a, form, of, mass, provisioning, some, species, do, not, leave, after, this, stage, but, remain, to, safeguard, their, offspring, the, dung, beetle, goes, through, a, complete, metamorphosis, the, larvae, live, in, brood, balls, made, with, dung, prepared, by, their, parents, during, the, larval, stage, the, beetle, feeds, on, the, dung, surrounding, it, the, behavior, of, the, beetles, was, poorly, understood, until, the, studies, of, jean, henri, fabre, in, the, late, 19th, century, for, example, fabre, corrected, the, myth, that, a, dung, beetle, would, seek, aid, from, other, dung, beetles, when, confronted, by, obstacles, by, observation, and, experiment, he, found, the, seeming, helpers, were, in, fact, awaiting, an, opportunity, to, steal, the, roller, s, food, source, they, are, widely, used, in, ecological, research, as, a, good, bioindicator, group, to, examine, the, impacts, of, climate, disturbances, such, as, extreme, droughts, and, associated, fires, and, human, activities, on, tropical, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, functioning, such, as, seed, dispersal, soil, bioturbation, and, nutrient, cycling, dung, beetles, play, a, role, in, agriculture, and, tropical, forests, by, burying, and, consuming, dung, they, improve, nutrient, recycling, and, soil, structure, dung, beetles, have, been, further, shown, to, improve, soil, conditions, and, plant, growth, on, rehabilitated, coal, mines, in, south, africa, they, are, also, important, for, the, dispersal, of, seeds, present, in, animals, dung, influencing, seed, burial, and, seedling, recruitment, in, tropical, forests, they, can, protect, livestock, such, as, cattle, by, removing, the, dung, which, if, left, could, provide, habitat, for, pests, such, as, flies, therefore, many, countries, have, introduced, the, creatures, for, the, benefit, of, animal, husbandry, the, american, institute, of, biological, sciences, reports, that, dung, beetles, save, the, united, states, cattle, industry, an, estimated, us, 380, million, annually, through, burying, above, ground, livestock, feces, in, australia, the, commonwealth, scientific, and, industrial, research, organisation, csiro, commissioned, the, australian, dung, beetle, project, 1965, 1985, which, led, by, george, bornemissza, sought, to, introduce, species, of, dung, beetles, from, south, africa, and, europe, the, successful, introduction, of, 23, species, was, made, most, notably, digitonthophagus, gazella, and, euoniticellus, intermedius, which, has, resulted, in, improvement, of, the, quality, and, fertility, of, australian, cattle, pastures, along, with, a, reduction, in, the, population, of, pestilent, australian, bush, flies, by, around, 90, in, 1995, it, was, reported, that, dung, beetles, were, being, trialled, in, the, sydney, beach, suburb, of, curl, curl, to, deal, with, dog, droppings, an, application, has, been, made, by, landcare, research, to, import, up, to, 11, species, of, dung, beetle, into, new, zealand, as, well, as, improving, pasture, soils, the, dung, beetle, release, strategy, group, say, that, it, would, result, in, a, reduction, in, emissions, of, nitrous, oxide, a, greenhouse, gas, from, agriculture, there, is, however, strong, opposition, from, some, at, the, university, of, auckland, and, a, few, others, based, on, the, risks, of, the, dung, beetles, acting, as, vectors, of, disease, there, are, public, health, researchers, at, the, university, of, auckland, who, agree, with, the, current, epa, risk, assessment, and, there, are, several, landcare, programmes, in, australia, that, involve, schoolchildren, collecting, dung, beetles, the, african, dung, beetle, d, gazella, was, introduced, in, several, locations, in, north, and, south, america, and, has, been, spreading, its, distribution, to, other, regions, by, natural, dispersal, and, accidental, transportation, and, is, now, probably, naturalized, in, most, countries, between, m, xico, and, argentina, the, exotic, species, might, be, useful, for, controlling, diseases, of, livestock, in, commercial, areas, and, might, displace, native, species, in, modified, landscapes, however, data, is, not, conclusive, about, its, effect, on, native, species, in, natural, environments, and, further, monitoring, is, required, like, many, other, insects, dried, dung, beetle, called, qi, ngl, ng, in, chinese, is, used, in, chinese, herbal, medicine, it, is, recorded, in, the, insect, section, of, the, compendium, of, materia, medica, where, it, is, recommended, for, the, cure, of, 10, diseases, in, isan, northeastern, thailand, the, local, people, eat, many, different, kinds, of, insects, including, the, dung, beetle, there, is, an, isan, song, where, did, the, dung, beetle, go, which, relates, the, replacement, of, water, buffalo, with, the, metal, buffalo, which, does, not, provide, the, dung, needed, for, the, dung, beetle, and, has, led, to, the, increasing, rarity, of, the, dung, beetle, in, the, agricultural, region, the, mediterranean, dung, beetle, bubas, bison, has, been, used, in, conjunction, with, biochar, stock, fodder, to, reduce, emissions, of, nitrous, oxide, and, carbon, dioxide, which, are, both, greenhouse, gases, the, beetles, work, the, biochar, enriched, dung, into, the, soil, without, the, use, of, machines, scientists, in, canberra, in, 1965, discovered, that, dung, beetles, scarabaeids, specifically, onthophagus, australis, gu, rin, m, neville, improve, plant, yields, using, their, dung, japanese, millet, was, studied, and, data, on, nutrient, uptake, these, plants, were, placed, in, pots, lacking, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, sulfur, cow, dung, was, then, added, in, treatment, groups, with, or, without, o, australis, some, treatment, groups, even, had, two, out, of, the, three, nutrients, supplemented, in, the, pots, comparisons, of, the, treatment, and, control, groups, were, made, to, show, that, top, growth, and, roots, significantly, increased, when, the, dung, was, mixed, well, into, the, soil, in, the, pots, results, showed, that, dung, beetle, activity, greatly, improved, plant, life, the, dung, has, little, impact, alone, but, in, combination, with, the, dung, beetle, the, nutritional, value, for, the, plants, increases, greatly, this, suggests, that, dung, beetles, have, many, positive, implications, for, the, environment, including, a, beneficial, role, with, plant, life, some, dung, beetles, are, used, as, food, in, south, east, asia, and, a, variety, of, dung, beetle, species, have, been, used, therapeutically, and, are, still, being, used, in, traditionally, living, societies, in, potions, and, folk, medicines, to, treat, a, number, of, illnesses, and, disorders, several, species, of, the, dung, beetle, most, notably, the, species, scarabaeus, sacer, often, referred, to, as, the, sacred, scarab, enjoyed, a, sacred, status, among, the, ancient, egyptians, egyptian, hieroglyphic, script, uses, the, image, of, the, beetle, to, represent, a, triliteral, phonetic, that, egyptologists, transliterate, as, xpr, or, pr, and, translate, as, to, come, into, being, to, become, or, to, transform, the, derivative, term, xprw, or, pr, w, is, variously, translated, as, form, transformation, happening, mode, of, being, or, what, has, come, into, being, depending, on, the, context, it, may, have, existential, fictional, or, ontologic, significance, the, scarab, was, linked, to, khepri, he, who, has, come, into, being, the, god, of, the, rising, sun, the, ancients, believed, that, the, dung, beetle, was, only, male, sexed, and, reproduced, by, depositing, semen, into, a, dung, ball, the, supposed, self, creation, of, the, beetle, resembles, that, of, khepri, who, creates, himself, out, of, nothing, moreover, the, dung, ball, rolled, by, a, dung, beetle, resembles, the, sun, plutarch, wrote, the, race, of, beetles, has, no, female, but, all, the, males, eject, their, sperm, into, a, round, pellet, of, material, which, they, roll, up, by, pushing, it, from, the, opposite, side, just, as, the, sun, seems, to, turn, the, heavens, in, the, direction, opposite, to, its, own, course, which, is, from, west, to, east, the, ancient, egyptians, believed, that, khepri, renewed, the, sun, every, day, before, rolling, it, above, the, horizon, then, carried, it, through, the, other, world, after, sunset, only, to, renew, it, again, the, next, day, some, new, kingdom, royal, tombs, exhibit, a, threefold, image, of, the, sun, god, with, the, beetle, as, symbol, of, the, morning, sun, the, astronomical, ceiling, in, the, tomb, of, ramses, vi, portrays, the, nightly, death, and, rebirth, of, the, sun, as, being, swallowed, by, nut, goddess, of, the, sky, and, re, emerging, from, her, womb, as, khepri, the, image, of, the, scarab, conveying, ideas, of, transformation, renewal, and, resurrection, is, ubiquitous, in, ancient, egyptian, religious, and, funerary, art, excavations, of, ancient, egyptian, sites, have, yielded, images, of, the, scarab, in, bone, ivory, stone, egyptian, faience, and, precious, metals, dating, from, the, sixth, dynasty, and, up, to, the, period, of, roman, rule, they, are, generally, small, bored, to, allow, stringing, on, a, necklace, and, the, base, bears, a, brief, inscription, or, cartouche, some, have, been, used, as, seals, pharaohs, sometimes, commissioned, the, manufacture, of, larger, images, with, lengthy, inscriptions, such, as, the, commemorative, scarab, of, queen, tiye, massive, sculptures, of, scarabs, can, be, seen, at, luxor, temple, at, the, serapeum, in, alexandria, see, serapis, and, elsewhere, in, egypt, the, scarab, was, of, prime, significance, in, the, funerary, cult, of, ancient, egypt, scarabs, generally, though, not, always, were, cut, from, green, stone, and, placed, on, the, chest, of, the, deceased, perhaps, the, most, famous, example, of, such, heart, scarabs, is, the, yellow, green, pectoral, scarab, found, among, the, entombed, provisions, of, tutankhamen, it, was, carved, from, a, large, piece, of, libyan, desert, glass, the, purpose, of, the, heart, scarab, was, to, ensure, that, the, heart, would, not, bear, witness, against, the, deceased, at, judgement, in, the, afterlife, other, possibilities, are, suggested, by, the, transformation, spells, of, the, coffin, texts, which, affirm, that, the, soul, of, the, deceased, may, transform, xpr, into, a, human, being, a, god, or, a, bird, and, reappear, in, the, world, of, the, living, one, scholar, comments, on, other, traits, of, the, scarab, connected, with, the, theme, of, death, and, rebirth, it, may, not, have, gone, unnoticed, that, the, pupa, whose, wings, and, legs, are, encased, at, this, stage, of, development, is, very, mummy, like, it, has, even, been, pointed, out, that, the, egg, bearing, ball, of, dung, is, created, in, an, underground, chamber, which, is, reached, by, a, vertical, shaft, and, horizontal, passage, curiously, reminiscent, of, old, kingdom, mastaba, tombs, in, contrast, to, funerary, contexts, some, of, ancient, egypt, s, neighbors, adopted, the, scarab, motif, for, seals, of, varying, types, the, best, known, of, these, being, judean, lmlk, seals, 8, of, 21, designs, contained, scarab, beetles, which, were, used, exclusively, to, stamp, impressions, on, storage, jars, during, the, reign, of, hezekiah, the, scarab, remains, an, item, of, popular, interest, thanks, to, modern, fascination, with, the, art, and, beliefs, of, ancient, egypt, scarab, beads, in, semiprecious, stones, or, glazed, ceramics, can, be, purchased, at, most, bead, shops, while, at, luxor, temple, a, massive, ancient, scarab, has, been, roped, off, to, discourage, visitors, from, rubbing, the, base, of, the, statue, for, luck, in, aesop, s, fable, the, eagle, and, the, beetle, the, eagle, kills, a, hare, that, has, asked, for, sanctuary, with, a, beetle, the, beetle, then, takes, revenge, by, twice, destroying, the, eagle, s, eggs, the, eagle, in, despair, flies, up, to, olympus, and, places, her, latest, eggs, in, zeus, s, lap, beseeching, the, god, to, protect, them, when, the, beetle, finds, out, what, the, eagle, has, done, it, stuffs, itself, with, dung, goes, straight, up, to, zeus, and, flies, right, into, his, face, zeus, is, startled, at, the, sight, of, the, unpleasant, creature, jumping, to, his, feet, so, that, the, eggs, are, broken, learning, of, the, origin, of, their, feud, zeus, attempts, to, mediate, and, when, his, efforts, to, mediate, fail, he, changes, the, breeding, season, of, the, eagle, to, a, time, when, the, beetles, are, not, above, ground, aristophanes, alluded, to, aesop, s, fable, several, times, in, his, plays, in, peace, the, hero, rides, up, to, olympus, to, free, the, goddess, peace, from, her, prison, his, steed, is, an, enormous, dung, beetle, which, has, been, fed, so, much, dung, that, it, has, grown, to, monstrous, size, hans, christian, andersen, s, the, dung, beetle, tells, the, story, of, a, dung, beetle, who, lives, in, the, stable, of, the, king, s, horses, in, an, imaginary, kingdom, when, he, demands, golden, shoes, like, those, the, king, s, horse, wears, and, is, refused, he, flies, away, and, has, a, series, of, adventures, which, are, often, precipitated, by, his, feeling, of, superiority, to, other, animals, he, finally, returns, to, the, stable, having, decided, against, all, logic, that, it, is, for, him, that, the, king, s, horse, wears, golden, shoes, in, franz, kafka,
