asexual, reproduction, is, a, type, of, reproduction, that, does, not, involve, the, fusion, of, gametes, or, change, in, the, number, of, chromosomes, the, offspring, that, arise, by, asexual, reproduction, from, either, unicellular, or, multicellular, organisms, inherit, the, full, set, of, genes, of, their, single, parent, and, thus, the, newly, created, individual, is, genetically, and, physically, similar, to, the, parent, or, an, exact, clone, of, the, parent, asexual, reproduction, is, the, primary, form, of, reproduction, for, single, celled, organisms, such, as, archaea, and, bacteria, many, eukaryotic, organisms, including, plants, animals, and, fungi, can, also, reproduce, asexually, in, vertebrates, the, most, common, form, of, asexual, reproduction, is, parthenogenesis, which, is, typically, used, as, an, alternative, to, sexual, reproduction, in, times, when, reproductive, opportunities, are, limited, komodo, dragons, and, some, monitor, lizards, can, reproduce, asexually, while, all, prokaryotes, reproduce, without, the, formation, and, fusion, of, gametes, mechanisms, for, lateral, gene, transfer, such, as, conjugation, transformation, and, transduction, can, be, likened, to, sexual, reproduction, in, the, sense, of, genetic, recombination, in, meiosis, prokaryotes, archaea, and, bacteria, reproduce, asexually, through, binary, fission, in, which, the, parent, organism, divides, in, two, to, produce, two, genetically, identical, daughter, organisms, eukaryotes, such, as, protists, and, unicellular, fungi, may, reproduce, in, a, functionally, similar, manner, by, mitosis, most, of, these, are, also, capable, of, sexual, reproduction, multiple, fission, at, the, cellular, level, occurs, in, many, protists, e, g, sporozoans, and, algae, the, nucleus, of, the, parent, cell, divides, several, times, by, mitosis, producing, several, nuclei, the, cytoplasm, then, separates, creating, multiple, daughter, cells, in, apicomplexans, multiple, fission, or, schizogony, appears, either, as, merogony, sporogony, or, gametogony, merogony, results, in, merozoites, which, are, multiple, daughter, cells, that, originate, within, the, same, cell, membrane, sporogony, results, in, sporozoites, and, gametogony, results, in, micro, gametes, some, cells, divide, by, budding, for, example, baker, s, yeast, resulting, in, a, mother, and, a, daughter, cell, that, is, initially, smaller, than, the, parent, budding, is, also, known, on, a, multicellular, level, an, animal, example, is, the, hydra, which, reproduces, by, budding, the, buds, grow, into, fully, matured, individuals, which, eventually, break, away, from, the, parent, organism, internal, budding, is, a, process, of, asexual, reproduction, favoured, by, parasites, such, as, toxoplasma, gondii, it, involves, an, unusual, process, in, which, two, endodyogeny, or, more, endopolygeny, daughter, cells, are, produced, inside, a, mother, cell, which, is, then, consumed, by, the, offspring, prior, to, their, separation, also, budding, external, or, internal, occurs, in, some, worms, like, taenia, or, echinococcus, these, worms, produce, cysts, and, then, produce, invaginated, or, evaginated, protoscolex, with, budding, vegetative, propagation, is, a, type, of, asexual, reproduction, found, in, plants, where, new, individuals, are, formed, without, the, production, of, seeds, or, spores, and, thus, without, syngamy, or, meiosis, examples, of, vegetative, reproduction, include, the, formation, of, miniaturized, plants, called, plantlets, on, specialized, leaves, for, example, in, kalanchoe, bryophyllum, daigremontianum, and, many, produce, new, plants, from, rhizomes, or, stolon, for, example, in, strawberry, some, plants, reproduce, by, forming, bulbs, or, tubers, for, example, tulip, bulbs, and, dahlia, tubers, in, these, examples, all, the, individuals, are, clones, and, the, clonal, population, may, cover, a, large, area, many, multicellular, organisms, produce, spores, during, their, biological, life, cycle, in, a, process, called, sporogenesis, exceptions, are, animals, and, some, protists, which, undergo, meiosis, immediately, followed, by, fertilization, plants, and, many, algae, on, the, other, hand, undergo, sporic, meiosis, where, meiosis, leads, to, the, formation, of, haploid, spores, rather, than, gametes, these, spores, grow, into, multicellular, individuals, called, gametophytes, without, a, fertilization, event, these, haploid, individuals, produce, gametes, through, mitosis, meiosis, and, gamete, formation, therefore, occur, in, separate, multicellular, generations, or, phases, of, the, life, cycle, referred, to, as, alternation, of, generations, since, sexual, reproduction, is, often, more, narrowly, defined, as, the, fusion, of, gametes, fertilization, spore, formation, in, plant, sporophytes, and, algae, might, be, considered, a, form, of, asexual, reproduction, agamogenesis, despite, being, the, result, of, meiosis, and, undergoing, a, reduction, in, ploidy, however, both, events, spore, formation, and, fertilization, are, necessary, to, complete, sexual, reproduction, in, the, plant, life, cycle, fungi, and, some, algae, can, also, utilize, true, asexual, spore, formation, which, involves, mitosis, giving, rise, to, reproductive, cells, called, mitospores, that, develop, into, a, new, organism, after, dispersal, this, method, of, reproduction, is, found, for, example, in, conidial, fungi, and, the, red, algae, polysiphonia, and, involves, sporogenesis, without, meiosis, thus, the, chromosome, number, of, the, spore, cell, is, the, same, as, that, of, the, parent, producing, the, spores, however, mitotic, sporogenesis, is, an, exception, and, most, spores, such, as, those, of, plants, and, many, algae, are, produced, by, meiosis, fragmentation, is, a, form, of, asexual, reproduction, where, a, new, organism, grows, from, a, fragment, of, the, parent, each, fragment, develops, into, a, mature, fully, grown, individual, fragmentation, is, seen, in, many, organisms, animals, that, reproduce, asexually, include, planarians, many, annelid, worms, including, polychaetes, and, some, oligochaetes, turbellarians, and, sea, stars, many, fungi, and, plants, reproduce, asexually, some, plants, have, specialized, structures, for, reproduction, via, fragmentation, such, as, gemmae, in, mosses, and, liverworts, most, lichens, which, are, a, symbiotic, union, of, a, fungus, and, photosynthetic, algae, or, cyanobacteria, reproduce, through, fragmentation, to, ensure, that, new, individuals, contain, both, symbionts, these, fragments, can, take, the, form, of, soredia, dust, like, particles, consisting, of, fungal, hyphae, wrapped, around, photobiont, cells, clonal, fragmentation, in, multicellular, or, colonial, organisms, is, a, form, of, asexual, reproduction, or, cloning, where, an, organism, is, split, into, fragments, each, of, these, fragments, develop, into, mature, fully, grown, individuals, that, are, clones, of, the, original, organism, in, echinoderms, this, method, of, reproduction, is, usually, known, as, fissiparity, due, to, many, environmental, and, epigenetic, differences, clones, originating, from, the, same, ancestor, might, actually, be, genetically, and, epigenetically, different, agamogenesis, is, any, form, of, reproduction, that, does, not, involve, a, male, gamete, examples, are, parthenogenesis, and, apomixis, parthenogenesis, is, a, form, of, agamogenesis, in, which, an, unfertilized, egg, develops, into, a, new, individual, it, has, been, documented, in, over, 2, 000, species, parthenogenesis, occurs, in, the, wild, in, many, invertebrates, e, g, water, fleas, rotifers, aphids, stick, insects, some, ants, bees, and, parasitic, wasps, and, vertebrates, mostly, reptiles, amphibians, and, fish, it, has, also, been, documented, in, domestic, birds, and, in, genetically, altered, lab, mice, plants, can, engage, in, parthenogenesis, as, well, through, a, process, called, apomixis, however, this, process, is, considered, by, many, to, not, be, an, independent, reproduction, method, but, instead, a, breakdown, of, the, mechanisms, behind, sexual, reproduction, parthenogenetic, organisms, can, be, split, into, two, main, categories, facultative, and, obligate, in, facultative, parthenogenesis, females, can, reproduce, both, sexually, and, asexually, because, of, the, many, advantages, of, sexual, reproduction, most, facultative, parthenotes, only, reproduce, asexually, when, forced, to, this, typically, occurs, in, instances, when, finding, a, mate, becomes, difficult, for, example, female, zebra, sharks, will, reproduce, asexually, if, they, are, unable, to, find, a, mate, in, their, ocean, habitats, parthenogenesis, was, previously, believed, to, rarely, occur, in, vertebrates, and, only, be, possible, in, very, small, animals, however, it, has, been, discovered, in, many, more, species, in, recent, years, today, the, largest, species, that, has, been, documented, reproducing, parthenogenically, is, the, komodo, dragon, at, 10, feet, long, and, over, 300, pounds, heterogony, is, a, form, of, facultative, parthenogenesis, where, females, alternate, between, sexual, and, asexual, reproduction, at, regular, intervals, see, alternation, between, sexual, and, asexual, reproduction, aphids, are, one, group, of, organism, that, engages, in, this, type, of, reproduction, they, use, asexual, reproduction, to, reproduce, quickly, and, create, winged, offspring, that, can, colonize, new, plants, and, reproduce, sexually, in, the, fall, to, lay, eggs, for, the, next, season, however, some, aphid, species, are, obligate, parthenotes, in, obligate, parthenogenesis, females, only, reproduce, asexually, one, example, of, this, is, the, desert, grassland, whiptail, lizard, a, hybrid, of, two, other, species, typically, hybrids, are, infertile, but, through, parthenogenesis, this, species, has, been, able, to, develop, stable, populations, gynogenesis, is, a, form, of, obligate, parthenogenesis, where, a, sperm, cell, is, used, to, initiate, reproduction, however, the, sperm, s, genes, never, get, incorporated, into, the, egg, cell, the, best, known, example, of, this, is, the, amazon, molly, because, they, are, obligate, parthenotes, there, are, no, males, in, their, species, so, they, depend, on, males, from, a, closely, related, species, the, sailfin, molly, for, sperm, apomixis, in, plants, is, the, formation, of, a, new, sporophyte, without, fertilization, it, is, important, in, ferns, and, in, flowering, plants, but, is, very, rare, in, other, seed, plants, in, flowering, plants, the, term, apomixis, is, now, most, often, used, for, agamospermy, the, formation, of, seeds, without, fertilization, but, was, once, used, to, include, vegetative, reproduction, an, example, of, an, apomictic, plant, would, be, the, triploid, european, dandelion, apomixis, mainly, occurs, in, two, forms, in, gametophytic, apomixis, the, embryo, arises, from, an, unfertilized, egg, within, a, diploid, embryo, sac, that, was, formed, without, completing, meiosis, in, nucellar, embryony, the, embryo, is, formed, from, the, diploid, nucellus, tissue, surrounding, the, embryo, sac, nucellar, embryony, occurs, in, some, citrus, seeds, male, apomixis, can, occur, in, rare, cases, such, as, in, the, saharan, cypress, cupressus, dupreziana, where, the, genetic, material, of, the, embryo, is, derived, entirely, from, pollen, androgenesis, occurs, when, a, zygote, is, produced, with, only, paternal, nuclear, genes, during, standard, sexual, reproduction, one, female, and, one, male, parent, each, produce, haploid, gametes, such, as, a, sperm, or, egg, cell, each, containing, only, a, single, set, of, chromosomes, which, recombine, to, create, offspring, with, genetic, material, from, both, parents, however, in, androgenesis, there, is, no, recombination, of, maternal, and, paternal, chromosomes, and, only, the, paternal, chromosomes, are, passed, down, to, the, offspring, the, inverse, of, this, is, gynogenesis, where, only, the, maternal, chromosomes, are, inherited, which, is, more, common, than, androgenesis, the, offspring, produced, in, androgenesis, will, still, have, maternally, inherited, mitochondria, as, is, the, case, with, most, sexually, reproducing, species, one, of, two, things, can, occur, to, produce, offspring, with, exclusively, paternal, genetic, material, the, maternal, nuclear, genome, can, be, eliminated, from, the, zygote, or, the, female, can, produce, an, egg, with, no, nucleus, resulting, in, an, embryo, developing, with, only, the, genome, of, the, male, gamete, androgenesis, is, seen, in, nature, in, the, stick, insect, bacillus, rossius, the, tassili, cypress, tree, cupressus, dupreziana, the, little, fire, ant, wasmannia, auropunctata, several, species, of, the, clam, genus, corbicula, and, occasionally, in, fruit, flies, drosophila, melanogaster, carrying, a, specific, mutant, allele, it, has, also, been, induced, in, many, crops, and, fish, via, irradiation, of, an, egg, cell, to, destroy, the, maternal, nuclear, genome, some, species, can, alternate, between, sexual, and, asexual, strategies, an, ability, known, as, heterogamy, depending, on, many, conditions, alternation, is, observed, in, several, rotifer, species, cyclical, parthenogenesis, e, g, in, brachionus, species, and, a, few, types, of, insects, one, example, of, this, is, aphids, which, can, engage, in, heterogony, in, this, system, females, are, born, pregnant, and, produce, only, female, offspring, this, cycle, allows, them, to, reproduce, very, quickly, however, most, species, reproduce, sexually, once, a, year, this, switch, is, triggered, by, environmental, changes, in, the, fall, and, causes, females, to, develop, eggs, instead, of, embryos, this, dynamic, reproductive, cycle, allows, them, to, produce, specialized, offspring, with, polyphenism, a, type, of, polymorphism, where, different, phenotypes, have, evolved, to, carry, out, specific, tasks, the, cape, bee, apis, mellifera, subsp, capensis, can, reproduce, asexually, through, a, process, called, thelytoky, the, freshwater, crustacean, daphnia, reproduces, by, parthenogenesis, in, the, spring, to, rapidly, populate, ponds, then, switches, to, sexual, reproduction, as, the, intensity, of, competition, and, predation, increases, monogonont, rotifers, of, the, genus, brachionus, reproduce, via, cyclical, parthenogenesis, at, low, population, densities, females, produce, asexually, and, at, higher, densities, a, chemical, cue, accumulates, and, induces, the, transition, to, sexual, reproduction, many, protists, and, fungi, alternate, between, sexual, and, asexual, reproduction, a, few, species, of, amphibians, reptiles, and, birds, have, a, similar, ability, the, slime, mold, dictyostelium, undergoes, binary, fission, mitosis, as, single, celled, amoebae, under, favorable, conditions, however, when, conditions, turn, unfavorable, the, cells, aggregate, and, follow, one, of, two, different, developmental, pathways, depending, on, conditions, in, the, social, pathway, they, form, a, multi, cellular, slug, which, then, forms, a, fruiting, body, with, asexually, generated, spores, in, the, sexual, pathway, two, cells, fuse, to, form, a, giant, cell, that, develops, into, a, large, cyst, when, this, macrocyst, germinates, it, releases, hundreds, of, amoebic, cells, that, are, the, product, of, meiotic, recombination, between, the, original, two, cells, the, hyphae, of, the, common, mold, rhizopus, are, capable, of, producing, both, mitotic, as, well, as, meiotic, spores, many, algae, similarly, switch, between, sexual, and, asexual, reproduction, a, number, of, plants, use, both, sexual, and, asexual, means, to, produce, new, plants, some, species, alter, their, primary, modes, of, reproduction, from, sexual, to, asexual, under, varying, environmental, conditions, in, the, rotifer, brachionus, calyciflorus, asexual, reproduction, obligate, parthenogenesis, can, be, inherited, by, a, recessive, allele, which, leads, to, loss, of, sexual, reproduction, in, homozygous, offspring, inheritance, of, asexual, reproduction, by, a, single, recessive, locus, has, also, been, found, in, the, parasitoid, wasp, lysiphlebus, fabarum, asexual, reproduction, is, found, in, nearly, half, of, the, animal, phyla, parthenogenesis, occurs, in, the, hammerhead, shark, and, the, blacktip, shark, in, both, cases, the, sharks, had, reached, sexual, maturity, in, captivity, in, the, absence, of, males, and, in, both, cases, the, offspring, were, shown, to, be, genetically, identical, to, the, mothers, the, new, mexico, whiptail, is, another, example, some, reptiles, use, the, zw, sex, determination, system, which, produces, either, males, with, zz, sex, chromosomes, or, females, with, zw, or, ww, sex, chromosomes, until, 2010, it, was, thought, that, the, zw, chromosome, system, used, by, reptiles, was, incapable, of, producing, viable, ww, offspring, but, a, zw, female, boa, constrictor, was, discovered, to, have, produced, viable, female, offspring, with, ww, chromosomes, the, female, boa, could, have, chosen, any, number, of, male, partners, and, had, successfully, in, the, past, but, on, this, occasion, she, reproduced, asexually, creating, 22, female, babies, with, ww, sex, chromosomes, polyembryony, is, a, widespread, form, of, asexual, reproduction, in, animals, whereby, the, fertilized, egg, or, a, later, stage, of, embryonic, development, splits, to, form, genetically, identical, clones, within, animals, this, phenomenon, has, been, best, studied, in, the, parasitic, hymenoptera, in, the, nine, banded, armadillos, this, process, is, obligatory, and, usually, gives, rise, to, genetically, identical, quadruplets, in, other, mammals, monozygotic, twinning, has, no, apparent, genetic, basis, though, its, occurrence, is, common, there, are, at, least, 10, million, identical, human, twins, and, triplets, in, the, world, today, bdelloid, rotifers, reproduce, exclusively, asexually, and, all, individuals, in, the, class, bdelloidea, are, females, asexuality, evolved, in, these, animals, millions, of, years, ago, and, has, persisted, since, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, that, asexual, reproduction, has, allowed, the, animals, to, evolve, new, proteins, through, the, meselson, effect, that, have, allowed, them, to, survive, better, in, periods, of, dehydration, bdelloid, rotifers, are, extraordinarily, resistant, to, damage, from, ionizing, radiation, due, to, the, same, dna, preserving, adaptations, used, to, survive, dormancy, these, adaptations, include, an, extremely, efficient, mechanism, for, repairing, dna, double, strand, breaks, this, repair, mechanism, was, studied, in, two, bdelloidea, species, adineta, vaga, and, philodina, roseola, and, appears, to, involve, mitotic, recombination, between, homologous, dna, regions, within, each, species, molecular, evidence, strongly, suggests, that, several, species, of, the, stick, insect, genus, timema, have, used, only, asexual, parthenogenetic, reproduction, for, millions, of, years, the, longest, period, known, for, any, insect, similar, findings, suggest, that, the, mite, species, oppiella, nova, may, have, reproduced, entirely, asexually, for, millions, of, years, in, the, grass, thrips, genus, aptinothrips, there, have, been, several, transitions, to, asexuality, likely, due, to, different, causes, a, complete, lack, of, sexual, reproduction, is, relatively, rare, among, multicellular, organisms, particularly, animals, it, is, not, entirely, understood, why, the, ability, to, reproduce, sexually, is, so, common, among, them, current, hypotheses, suggest, that, asexual, reproduction, may, have, short, term, benefits, when, rapid, population, growth, is, important, or, in, stable, environments, while, sexual, reproduction, offers, a, net, advantage, by, allowing, more, rapid, generation, of, genetic, diversity, allowing, adaptation, to, changing, environments, developmental, constraints, may, underlie, why, few, animals, have, relinquished, sexual, reproduction, completely, in, their, life, cycles, almost, all, asexual, modes, of, reproduction, maintain, meiosis, either, in, a, modified, form, or, as, an, alternative, pathway, facultatively, apomictic, plants, increase, frequencies, of, sexuality, relative, to, apomixis, after, abiotic, stress, another, constraint, on, switching, from, sexual, to, asexual, reproduction, would, be, the, concomitant, loss, of, meiosis, and, the, protective, recombinational, repair, of, dna, damage, afforded, as, one, function, of, meiosis
