cattle, bos, taurus, are, large, domesticated, bovid, ungulates, widely, kept, as, livestock, they, are, prominent, modern, members, of, the, subfamily, bovinae, and, the, most, widespread, species, of, the, genus, bos, mature, female, cattle, are, called, cows, and, mature, male, cattle, are, bulls, young, female, cattle, are, called, heifers, young, male, cattle, are, oxen, or, bullocks, and, castrated, male, cattle, are, known, as, steers, cattle, are, commonly, raised, for, meat, for, dairy, products, and, for, leather, as, draft, animals, they, pull, carts, and, farm, implements, in, india, cattle, are, sacred, animals, within, hinduism, and, may, not, be, killed, small, breeds, such, as, the, miniature, zebu, are, kept, as, pets, taurine, cattle, are, widely, distributed, across, europe, and, temperate, areas, of, asia, the, americas, and, australia, zebus, are, found, mainly, in, india, and, tropical, areas, of, asia, america, and, australia, sanga, cattle, are, found, primarily, in, sub, saharan, africa, these, types, sometimes, classified, as, separate, species, or, subspecies, are, further, divided, into, over, 1, 000, recognized, breeds, around, 10, 500, years, ago, taurine, cattle, were, domesticated, from, wild, aurochs, progenitors, in, central, anatolia, the, levant, and, western, iran, a, separate, domestication, event, occurred, in, the, indian, subcontinent, which, gave, rise, to, zebu, there, were, over, 940, million, cattle, in, the, world, by, 2022, cattle, are, responsible, for, around, 7, of, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, they, were, one, of, the, first, domesticated, animals, to, have, a, fully, mapped, genome, the, term, cattle, was, borrowed, from, anglo, norman, catel, itself, from, medieval, latin, capitale, principal, sum, of, money, capital, itself, derived, in, turn, from, latin, caput, head, cattle, originally, meant, movable, personal, property, especially, livestock, of, any, kind, as, opposed, to, real, property, the, land, which, also, included, wild, or, small, free, roaming, animals, such, as, chickens, they, were, sold, as, part, of, the, land, the, word, is, a, variant, of, chattel, a, unit, of, personal, property, and, closely, related, to, capital, in, the, economic, sense, the, word, cow, came, via, anglo, saxon, c, plural, c, from, common, indo, european, g, us, genitive, g, ow, s, a, bovine, animal, cf, persian, g, v, sanskrit, go, in, older, english, sources, such, as, the, king, james, version, of, the, bible, cattle, often, means, livestock, as, opposed, to, deer, which, are, wild, cattle, are, large, artiodactyls, mammals, with, cloven, hooves, meaning, that, they, walk, on, two, toes, the, third, and, fourth, digits, like, all, bovid, species, they, can, have, horns, which, are, unbranched, and, are, not, shed, annually, coloration, varies, with, breed, common, colors, are, black, white, and, red, brown, and, some, breeds, are, spotted, or, have, mixed, colors, bulls, are, larger, than, cows, of, the, same, breed, by, up, to, a, few, hundred, kilograms, british, hereford, cows, for, example, weigh, 600, 800, kg, 1, 300, 1, 800, lb, while, the, bulls, weigh, 1, 000, 1, 200, kg, 2, 200, 2, 600, lb, before, 1790, beef, cattle, averaged, only, 160, kg, 350, lb, net, thereafter, weights, climbed, steadily, cattle, breeds, vary, widely, in, size, the, tallest, and, heaviest, is, the, chianina, where, a, mature, bull, may, be, up, to, 1, 8, m, 5, ft, 11, in, at, the, shoulder, and, may, reach, 1, 280, kg, 2, 820, lb, in, weight, the, natural, life, of, domestic, cattle, is, some, 25, 30, years, beef, cattle, go, to, slaughter, at, around, 18, months, and, dairy, cows, at, about, five, years, cattle, are, ruminants, meaning, their, digestive, system, is, highly, specialized, for, processing, plant, material, such, as, grass, rich, in, cellulose, a, tough, carbohydrate, polymer, which, many, animals, cannot, digest, they, do, this, in, symbiosis, with, micro, organisms, bacteria, fungi, and, protozoa, that, possess, cellulases, enzymes, that, split, cellulose, into, its, constituent, sugars, among, the, many, bacteria, that, contribute, are, fibrobacter, succinogenes, ruminococcus, flavefaciens, and, ruminococcus, albus, cellulolytic, fungi, include, several, species, of, neocallimastix, while, the, protozoa, include, the, ciliates, eudiplodinium, maggie, and, ostracodinium, album, if, the, animal, s, feed, changes, over, time, the, composition, of, this, microbiome, changes, in, response, cattle, have, one, large, stomach, with, four, compartments, the, rumen, reticulum, omasum, and, abomasum, the, rumen, is, the, largest, compartment, and, it, harbours, the, most, important, parts, of, the, microbiome, the, reticulum, the, smallest, compartment, is, known, as, the, honeycomb, the, omasum, s, main, function, is, to, absorb, water, and, nutrients, from, the, digestible, feed, the, abomasum, has, a, similar, function, to, the, human, stomach, cattle, regurgitate, and, re, chew, their, food, in, the, process, of, chewing, the, cud, like, most, ruminants, while, feeding, cows, swallow, their, food, without, chewing, it, goes, into, the, rumen, for, storage, later, the, food, is, regurgitated, to, the, mouth, a, mouthful, at, a, time, where, the, cud, is, chewed, by, the, molars, grinding, down, the, coarse, vegetation, to, small, particles, the, cud, is, then, swallowed, again, and, further, digested, by, the, micro, organisms, in, the, cow, s, stomach, the, gestation, period, for, a, cow, is, about, nine, months, long, the, ratio, of, male, to, female, offspring, at, birth, is, approximately, 52, 48, a, cow, s, udder, has, two, pairs, of, mammary, glands, or, teats, farms, often, use, artificial, insemination, the, artificial, deposition, of, semen, in, the, female, s, genital, tract, this, allows, farmers, to, choose, from, a, wide, range, of, bulls, to, breed, their, cattle, estrus, too, may, be, artificially, induced, to, facilitate, the, process, copulation, lasts, several, seconds, and, consists, of, a, single, pelvic, thrust, cows, seek, secluded, areas, for, calving, semi, wild, highland, cattle, heifers, first, give, birth, at, 2, or, 3, years, of, age, and, the, timing, of, birth, is, synchronized, with, increases, in, natural, food, quality, average, calving, interval, is, 391, days, and, calving, mortality, within, the, first, year, of, life, is, 5, beef, calves, suckle, an, average, of, 5, times, per, day, spending, some, 46, minutes, suckling, there, is, a, diurnal, rhythm, in, suckling, peaking, at, roughly, 6am, 11, 30am, and, 7pm, under, natural, conditions, calves, stay, with, their, mother, until, weaning, at, 8, to, 11, months, heifer, and, bull, calves, are, equally, attached, to, their, mothers, in, the, first, few, months, of, life, cattle, have, a, variety, of, cognitive, abilities, they, can, memorize, the, locations, of, multiple, food, sources, and, can, retain, memories, for, at, least, 48, days, young, cattle, learn, more, quickly, than, adults, and, calves, are, capable, of, discrimination, learning, distinguishing, familiar, and, unfamiliar, animals, and, between, humans, using, faces, and, other, cues, calves, prefer, their, own, mother, s, vocalizations, to, those, of, an, unfamiliar, cow, vocalizations, provide, information, on, the, age, sex, dominance, status, and, reproductive, status, of, the, caller, and, may, indicate, estrus, in, cows, and, competitive, display, in, bulls, cows, can, categorize, images, as, familiar, and, unfamiliar, individuals, cloned, calves, from, the, same, donor, form, subgroups, suggesting, that, kin, discrimination, may, be, a, basis, of, grouping, behaviour, cattle, use, visual, brain, lateralisation, when, scanning, novel, and, familiar, stimuli, they, prefer, to, view, novel, stimuli, with, the, left, eye, using, the, right, brain, hemisphere, but, the, right, eye, for, familiar, stimuli, individual, cattle, have, also, been, observed, to, display, different, personality, traits, such, as, fearfulness, and, sociability, vision, is, the, dominant, sense, cattle, obtain, almost, half, of, their, information, visually, being, prey, animals, cattle, evolved, to, look, out, for, predators, almost, all, around, with, eyes, that, are, on, the, sides, of, their, head, rather, than, the, front, this, gives, them, a, field, of, view, of, 330, but, limits, binocular, vision, and, therefore, stereopsis, to, some, 30, to, 50, compared, to, 140, in, humans, they, are, dichromatic, like, most, mammals, cattle, avoid, bitter, tasting, foods, selecting, sweet, foods, for, energy, their, sensitivity, to, sour, tasting, foods, helps, them, to, maintain, optimal, ruminal, ph, they, seek, out, salty, foods, by, taste, and, smell, to, maintain, their, electrolyte, balance, their, hearing, is, better, than, that, of, horses, but, worse, at, localising, sounds, than, goats, and, much, worse, than, dogs, or, humans, they, can, distinguish, between, live, and, recorded, human, speech, olfaction, probably, plays, a, large, role, in, their, social, life, indicating, social, and, reproductive, status, cattle, can, tell, when, other, animals, are, stressed, by, smelling, the, alarm, chemicals, in, their, urine, cattle, can, be, trained, to, recognise, conspecific, individuals, using, olfaction, only, cattle, live, in, a, dominance, hierarchy, this, is, maintained, in, several, ways, cattle, often, engage, in, mock, fights, where, they, test, each, other, s, strength, in, a, non, aggressive, way, licking, is, primarily, performed, by, subordinates, and, received, by, dominant, animals, mounting, is, a, playful, behavior, shown, by, calves, of, both, sexes, and, by, bulls, and, sometimes, by, cows, in, estrus, however, this, is, not, a, dominance, related, behavior, as, has, been, found, in, other, species, dominance, associated, aggressiveness, does, not, correlate, with, rank, position, but, is, closely, related, to, rank, distance, between, individuals, the, horns, of, cattle, are, honest, signals, used, in, mate, selection, horned, cattle, attempt, to, keep, greater, distances, between, themselves, and, have, fewer, physical, interactions, than, hornless, cattle, resulting, in, more, stable, social, relationships, in, calves, agonistic, behavior, becomes, less, frequent, as, space, allowance, increases, but, not, as, group, size, changes, whereas, in, adults, the, number, of, agonistic, encounters, increases, with, group, size, dominance, relationships, in, semi, wild, highland, cattle, are, very, firm, with, few, overt, aggressive, conflicts, most, disputes, are, settled, by, agonistic, non, aggressive, competitive, behaviors, with, no, physical, contact, between, opponents, reducing, the, risk, of, injury, dominance, status, depends, on, age, and, sex, with, older, animals, usually, dominant, to, young, ones, and, males, dominant, to, females, young, bulls, gain, superior, dominance, status, over, adult, cows, when, they, reach, about, 2, years, of, age, cattle, eat, mixed, diets, but, prefer, to, eat, approximately, 70, clover, and, 30, grass, this, preference, has, a, diurnal, pattern, with, a, stronger, preference, for, clover, in, the, morning, and, the, proportion, of, grass, increasing, towards, the, evening, when, grazing, cattle, vary, several, aspects, of, their, bite, i, e, tongue, and, jaw, movements, depending, on, characteristics, of, the, plant, they, are, eating, bite, area, decreases, with, the, density, of, the, plants, but, increases, with, their, height, bite, area, is, determined, by, the, sweep, of, the, tongue, in, one, study, observing, 750, kilogram, 1, 650, lb, steers, bite, area, reached, a, maximum, of, approximately, 170, cm, 2, 30, sq, in, bite, depth, increases, with, the, height, of, the, plants, by, adjusting, their, behavior, cattle, obtain, heavier, bites, in, swards, that, are, tall, and, sparse, compared, with, short, dense, swards, of, equal, mass, area, cattle, adjust, other, aspects, of, their, grazing, behavior, in, relation, to, the, available, food, foraging, velocity, decreases, and, intake, rate, increases, in, areas, of, abundant, palatable, forage, cattle, avoid, grazing, areas, contaminated, by, the, faeces, of, other, cattle, more, strongly, than, they, avoid, areas, contaminated, by, sheep, but, they, do, not, avoid, pasture, contaminated, by, rabbits, in, cattle, temperament, or, behavioral, disposition, can, affect, productivity, overall, health, and, reproduction, five, underlying, categories, of, temperament, traits, have, been, proposed, shyness, boldness, exploration, avoidance, activity, aggressiveness, and, sociability, there, are, many, indicators, of, emotion, in, cattle, holstein, friesian, heifers, that, had, made, clear, improvements, in, a, learning, experiment, had, higher, heart, rates, indicating, an, emotional, reaction, to, their, own, learning, after, separation, from, their, mothers, holstein, calves, react, indicating, low, mood, similarly, after, hot, iron, dehorning, calves, react, to, the, post, operative, pain, the, position, of, the, ears, has, been, used, as, an, indicator, of, emotional, state, cattle, can, tell, when, other, cattle, are, stressed, by, the, chemicals, in, their, urine, cattle, are, gregarious, and, even, short, term, isolation, causes, psychological, stress, when, heifers, are, isolated, vocalizations, heart, rate, and, plasma, cortisol, all, increase, when, visual, contact, is, re, instated, vocalizations, rapidly, decline, heart, rate, decreases, more, rapidly, if, the, returning, cattle, are, familiar, to, the, previously, isolated, individual, mirrors, have, been, used, to, reduce, stress, in, isolated, cattle, the, average, sleep, time, of, a, domestic, cow, is, about, 4, hours, a, day, cattle, do, have, a, stay, apparatus, but, do, not, sleep, standing, up, they, lie, down, to, sleep, deeply, in, 2009, the, national, institutes, of, health, and, the, us, department, of, agriculture, reported, having, mapped, the, bovine, genome, cattle, have, some, 22, 000, genes, of, which, 80, are, shared, with, humans, they, have, about, 1000, genes, that, they, share, with, dogs, and, rodents, but, not, with, humans, using, this, bovine, hapmap, researchers, can, track, the, differences, between, breeds, that, affect, meat, and, milk, yields, early, research, focused, on, hereford, genetic, sequences, a, wider, study, mapped, a, further, 4, 2, of, the, cattle, genome, behavioral, traits, of, cattle, can, be, as, heritable, as, some, production, traits, and, often, the, two, can, be, related, the, heritability, of, temperament, response, to, isolation, during, handling, has, been, calculated, as, 0, 36, and, 0, 46, for, habituation, to, handling, rangeland, assessments, show, that, the, heritability, of, aggressiveness, in, cattle, is, around, 0, 36, quantitative, trait, loci, have, been, found, for, a, range, of, production, and, behavioral, characteristics, for, both, dairy, and, beef, cattle, cattle, have, played, a, key, role, in, human, history, having, been, domesticated, since, at, least, the, early, neolithic, age, archaeozoological, and, genetic, data, indicate, that, cattle, were, first, domesticated, from, wild, aurochs, bos, primigenius, approximately, 10, 500, years, ago, there, were, two, major, areas, of, domestication, one, in, central, anatolia, the, levant, and, western, iran, giving, rise, to, the, taurine, line, and, a, second, in, the, area, that, is, now, pakistan, resulting, in, the, indicine, line, modern, mitochondrial, dna, variation, indicates, the, taurine, line, may, have, arisen, from, as, few, as, 80, aurochs, tamed, in, the, upper, reaches, of, mesopotamia, near, the, villages, of, ay, n, tepesi, in, what, is, now, southeastern, turkey, and, dja, de, el, mughara, in, what, is, now, northern, syria, although, european, cattle, are, largely, descended, from, the, taurine, lineage, gene, flow, from, african, cattle, partially, of, indicine, origin, contributed, substantial, genomic, components, to, both, southern, european, cattle, breeds, and, their, new, world, descendants, a, study, on, 134, breeds, showed, that, modern, taurine, cattle, originated, from, africa, asia, north, and, south, america, australia, and, europe, some, researchers, have, suggested, that, african, taurine, cattle, are, derived, from, a, third, independent, domestication, from, the, north, african, aurochs, whether, there, have, been, two, or, three, domestications, european, african, and, asian, cattle, share, much, of, their, genomes, both, through, their, species, ancestry, and, through, repeated, migrations, of, livestock, and, genetic, material, between, species, as, shown, in, the, diagram, cattle, were, originally, identified, as, three, separate, species, bos, taurus, the, european, or, taurine, cattle, including, similar, types, from, africa, and, asia, bos, indicus, the, indicine, or, zebu, and, the, extinct, bos, primigenius, the, aurochs, the, aurochs, is, ancestral, to, both, zebu, and, taurine, cattle, they, were, later, reclassified, as, one, species, bos, taurus, with, the, aurochs, b, t, primigenius, zebu, b, t, indicus, and, taurine, b, t, taurus, cattle, as, subspecies, however, this, taxonomy, is, contentious, and, authorities, such, as, the, american, society, of, mammalogists, treat, these, taxa, as, separate, species, complicating, the, matter, is, the, ability, of, cattle, to, interbreed, with, other, closely, related, species, hybrid, individuals, and, even, breeds, exist, not, only, between, taurine, cattle, and, zebu, such, as, the, sanga, cattle, bos, taurus, africanus, x, bos, indicus, but, also, between, one, or, both, of, these, and, some, other, members, of, the, genus, bos, yaks, the, dzo, or, yattle, banteng, and, gaur, hybrids, such, as, the, beefalo, breed, can, even, occur, between, taurine, cattle, and, either, species, of, bison, leading, some, authors, to, consider, them, part, of, the, genus, bos, as, well, the, hybrid, origin, of, some, types, may, not, be, obvious, for, example, genetic, testing, of, the, dwarf, lulu, breed, the, only, taurine, type, cattle, in, nepal, found, them, to, be, a, mix, of, taurine, cattle, zebu, and, yak, the, aurochs, originally, ranged, throughout, europe, north, africa, and, much, of, asia, in, historical, times, its, range, became, restricted, to, europe, and, the, last, known, individual, died, in, mazovia, poland, around, 1627, breeders, have, attempted, to, recreate, a, similar, appearance, to, the, aurochs, by, crossing, traditional, types, of, domesticated, cattle, producing, the, heck, breed, a, group, of, taurine, type, cattle, exist, in, africa, they, either, represent, an, independent, domestication, event, or, were, the, result, of, crossing, taurines, domesticated, elsewhere, with, local, aurochs, but, they, are, genetically, distinct, some, authors, name, them, as, a, separate, subspecies, bos, taurus, africanus, the, only, pure, african, taurine, breeds, remaining, are, the, n, dama, kuri, and, some, varieties, of, the, west, african, shorthorn, feral, cattle, are, those, that, have, been, allowed, to, go, wild, populations, exist, in, many, parts, of, the, world, sometimes, on, small, islands, some, such, as, amsterdam, island, cattle, chillingham, cattle, and, aleutian, wild, cattle, have, become, sufficiently, distinct, to, be, described, as, breeds, cattle, are, often, raised, by, allowing, herds, to, graze, on, the, grasses, of, large, tracts, of, rangeland, raising, cattle, extensively, in, this, manner, allows, the, use, of, land, that, might, be, unsuitable, for, growing, crops, the, most, common, interactions, with, cattle, involve, daily, feeding, cleaning, and, milking, many, routine, husbandry, practices, involve, ear, tagging, dehorning, loading, medical, operations, artificial, insemination, vaccinations, and, hoof, care, as, well, as, training, for, agricultural, shows, and, preparations, around, the, world, fulani, husbandry, rests, on, behavioural, techniques, whereas, in, europe, cattle, are, controlled, primarily, by, physical, means, such, as, fences, breeders, use, cattle, husbandry, to, reduce, tuberculosis, susceptibility, by, selective, breeding, and, maintaining, herd, health, to, avoid, concurrent, disease, in, the, united, states, many, cattle, are, raised, intensively, kept, in, concentrated, animal, feeding, operations, meaning, there, are, at, least, 700, mature, dairy, cows, or, at, least, 1000, other, cattle, stabled, or, confined, in, a, feedlot, for, 45, days, or, more, in, a, 12, month, period, historically, the, cattle, population, of, britain, rose, from, 9, 8, million, in, 1878, to, 11, 7, million, in, 1908, but, beef, consumption, rose, much, faster, britain, became, the, stud, farm, of, the, world, exporting, livestock, to, countries, where, there, were, no, indigenous, cattle, in, 1929, 80, of, the, meat, trade, of, the, world, was, products, of, what, were, originally, english, breeds, there, were, nearly, 70, million, cattle, in, the, us, by, the, early, 1930s, cattle, have, the, largest, biomass, of, any, animal, species, on, earth, at, roughly, 400, million, tonnes, followed, closely, by, antarctic, krill, at, 379, million, tonnes, and, humans, at, 373, million, tonnes, in, 2023, the, countries, with, the, most, cattle, were, india, with, 307, 5, million, 32, 6, of, the, total, brazil, with, 194, 4, million, and, china, with, 101, 5, million, out, of, a, total, of, 942, 6, million, in, the, world, cattle, are, kept, on, farms, to, produce, meat, milk, and, leather, and, sometimes, to, pull, carts, or, farm, implements, the, meat, of, adult, cattle, is, known, as, beef, and, that, of, calves, as, veal, other, body, parts, are, used, as, food, products, including, blood, liver, kidney, heart, and, oxtail, approximately, 300, million, cattle, including, dairy, animals, are, slaughtered, each, year, for, food, about, a, quarter, of, the, world, s, meat, comes, from, cattle, world, cattle, meat, production, in, 2021, was, 72, 3, million, tons, certain, breeds, of, cattle, such, as, the, holstein, friesian, are, used, to, produce, milk, much, of, which, is, processed, into, dairy, products, such, as, butter, cheese, and, yogurt, dairy, cattle, are, usually, kept, on, specialized, dairy, farms, designed, for, milk, production, most, cows, are, milked, twice, per, day, with, milk, processed, at, a, dairy, which, may, be, onsite, at, the, farm, or, the, milk, may, be, shipped, to, a, dairy, plant, for, eventual, sale, of, a, dairy, product, lactation, is, induced, in, heifers, and, spayed, cows, by, a, combination, of, physical, and, psychological, stimulation, by, drugs, or, by, a, combination, of, those, methods, for, mother, cows, to, continue, producing, milk, they, give, birth, to, one, calf, per, year, if, the, calf, is, male, it, is, generally, slaughtered, at, a, young, age, to, produce, veal, cows, produce, milk, until, three, weeks, before, birth, over, the, last, fifty, years, dairy, farming, has, become, more, intensive, to, increase, the, yield, of, milk, produced, by, each, cow, the, holstein, friesian, is, the, breed, of, dairy, cow, most, common, in, the, uk, europe, and, the, united, states, it, has, been, bred, selectively, to, produce, the, highest, yields, of, milk, of, any, cow, the, average, in, the, uk, is, around, 22, litres, per, day, dairy, is, a, large, industry, worldwide, in, 2023, the, 27, european, union, countries, produced, 143, million, tons, of, cow, s, milk, the, united, states, 104, 1, million, tons, and, india, 99, 5, million, tons, india, further, produces, 94, 4, million, tons, of, buffalo, milk, making, it, in, 2023, the, world, s, largest, milk, producer, its, dairy, industry,

especially, in, developing, countries, there, are, some, 11, million, draft, oxen, in, sub, saharan, africa, while, in, 1998, india, had, over, 65, million, oxen, at, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, about, half, the, world, s, crop, production, depended, on, land, preparation, by, draft, animals, cattle, are, not, often, kept, solely, for, hides, and, they, are, usually, a, by, product, of, beef, production, hides, are, used, mainly, for, leather, products, such, as, shoes, in, 2012, india, was, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, cattle, hides, cattle, hides, account, for, around, 65, of, the, world, s, leather, production, cattle, are, subject, to, pests, including, arthropod, parasites, such, as, ticks, which, can, in, turn, transmit, diseases, caused, by, bacteria, and,
