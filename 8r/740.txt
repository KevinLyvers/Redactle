felidae, f, l, d, i, is, the, family, of, mammals, in, the, order, carnivora, colloquially, referred, to, as, cats, a, member, of, this, family, is, also, called, a, felid, f, i, l, d, the, 41, extant, felidae, species, exhibit, the, greatest, diversity, in, fur, patterns, of, all, terrestrial, carnivores, cats, have, retractile, claws, slender, muscular, bodies, and, strong, flexible, forelimbs, their, teeth, and, facial, muscles, allow, for, a, powerful, bite, they, are, all, obligate, carnivores, and, most, are, solitary, predators, ambushing, or, stalking, their, prey, wild, cats, occur, in, africa, europe, asia, and, the, americas, some, wild, cat, species, are, adapted, to, forest, and, savanna, habitats, some, to, arid, environments, and, a, few, also, to, wetlands, and, mountainous, terrain, their, activity, patterns, range, from, nocturnal, and, crepuscular, to, diurnal, depending, on, their, preferred, prey, species, reginald, innes, pocock, divided, the, extant, felidae, into, three, subfamilies, the, pantherinae, the, felinae, and, the, acinonychinae, differing, from, each, other, by, the, ossification, of, the, hyoid, apparatus, and, by, the, cutaneous, sheaths, which, protect, their, claws, this, concept, has, been, revised, following, developments, in, molecular, biology, and, techniques, for, the, analysis, of, morphological, data, today, the, living, felidae, are, divided, into, two, subfamilies, the, pantherinae, and, felinae, with, the, acinonychinae, subsumed, into, the, latter, pantherinae, includes, five, panthera, and, two, neofelis, species, while, felinae, includes, the, other, 34, species, in, 12, genera, the, first, cats, emerged, during, the, oligocene, about, 25, million, years, ago, with, the, appearance, of, proailurus, and, pseudaelurus, the, latter, species, complex, was, ancestral, to, two, main, lines, of, felids, the, cats, in, the, extant, subfamilies, and, a, group, of, extinct, saber, tooth, felids, of, the, subfamily, machairodontinae, which, range, from, the, type, genus, machairodus, of, the, late, miocene, to, smilodon, of, the, pleistocene, the, false, saber, toothed, cats, the, barbourofelidae, and, nimravidae, are, not, true, cats, but, are, closely, related, together, with, the, felidae, viverridae, hyenas, and, mongooses, they, constitute, the, feliformia, all, members, of, the, cat, family, have, the, following, characteristics, in, common, the, colour, length, and, density, of, their, fur, are, very, diverse, fur, colour, covers, the, gamut, from, white, to, black, and, fur, patterns, from, distinctive, small, spots, and, stripes, to, small, blotches, and, rosettes, most, cat, species, are, born, with, spotted, fur, except, the, jaguarundi, herpailurus, yagouaroundi, asian, golden, cat, catopuma, temminckii, and, caracal, caracal, caracal, the, spotted, fur, of, lion, panthera, leo, and, cougar, puma, concolor, cubs, change, to, uniform, fur, during, their, ontogeny, those, living, in, cold, environments, have, thick, fur, with, long, hair, like, the, snow, leopard, panthera, uncia, and, the, pallas, s, cat, otocolobus, manul, those, living, in, tropical, and, hot, climate, zones, have, short, fur, several, species, exhibit, melanism, with, all, black, individuals, in, the, great, majority, of, cat, species, the, tail, is, between, a, third, and, a, half, of, the, body, length, although, with, some, exceptions, like, the, lynx, species, and, margay, leopardus, wiedii, cat, species, vary, greatly, in, body, and, skull, sizes, and, weights, most, cat, species, have, a, haploid, number, of, 18, or, 19, central, and, south, american, cats, have, a, haploid, number, of, 18, possibly, due, to, the, combination, of, two, smaller, chromosomes, into, a, larger, one, felidae, have, type, iix, muscle, fibers, three, times, more, powerful, than, the, muscle, fibers, of, human, athletes, the, family, felidae, is, part, of, the, feliformia, a, suborder, that, diverged, probably, about, 50, 6, to, 35, million, years, ago, into, several, families, the, felidae, and, the, asiatic, linsangs, are, considered, a, sister, group, which, split, about, 35, 2, to, 31, 9, million, years, ago, the, earliest, cats, probably, appeared, about, 35, to, 28, 5, million, years, ago, proailurus, is, the, oldest, known, cat, that, occurred, after, the, eocene, oligocene, extinction, event, about, 33, 9, million, years, ago, fossil, remains, were, excavated, in, france, and, mongolia, s, hsanda, gol, formation, fossil, occurrences, indicate, that, the, felidae, arrived, in, north, america, around, 18, 5, million, years, ago, this, is, about, 20, million, years, later, than, the, ursidae, and, the, nimravidae, and, about, 10, million, years, later, than, the, canidae, in, the, early, miocene, about, 20, to, 16, 6, million, years, ago, pseudaelurus, lived, in, africa, its, fossil, jaws, were, also, excavated, in, geological, formations, of, europe, s, vallesian, asia, s, middle, miocene, and, north, america, s, late, hemingfordian, to, late, barstovian, epochs, in, the, early, or, middle, miocene, the, saber, toothed, machairodontinae, evolved, in, africa, and, migrated, northwards, in, the, late, miocene, with, their, large, upper, canines, they, were, adapted, to, prey, on, large, bodied, megaherbivores, miomachairodus, is, the, oldest, known, member, of, this, subfamily, metailurus, lived, in, africa, and, eurasia, about, 8, to, 6, million, years, ago, several, paramachaerodus, skeletons, were, found, in, spain, homotherium, appeared, in, africa, eurasia, and, north, america, around, 3, 5, million, years, ago, and, megantereon, about, 3, million, years, ago, smilodon, lived, in, north, and, south, america, from, about, 2, 5, million, years, ago, this, subfamily, became, extinct, in, the, late, pleistocene, results, of, mitochondrial, analysis, indicate, that, the, living, felidae, species, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, which, originated, in, asia, in, the, late, miocene, epoch, they, migrated, to, africa, europe, and, the, americas, in, the, course, of, at, least, 10, migration, waves, during, the, past, 11, million, years, low, sea, levels, and, interglacial, and, glacial, periods, facilitated, these, migrations, panthera, blytheae, is, the, oldest, known, pantherine, cat, dated, to, the, late, messinian, to, early, zanclean, ages, about, 5, 95, to, 4, 1, million, years, ago, a, fossil, skull, was, excavated, in, 2010, in, zanda, county, on, the, tibetan, plateau, panthera, palaeosinensis, from, north, china, probably, dates, to, the, late, miocene, or, early, pliocene, the, skull, of, the, holotype, is, similar, to, that, of, a, lion, or, leopard, panthera, zdanskyi, dates, to, the, gelasian, about, 2, 55, to, 2, 16, million, years, ago, several, fossil, skulls, and, jawbones, were, excavated, in, northwestern, china, panthera, gombaszoegensis, is, the, earliest, known, pantherine, cat, that, lived, in, europe, about, 1, 95, to, 1, 77, million, years, ago, living, felids, fall, into, eight, evolutionary, lineages, or, species, clades, genotyping, of, the, nuclear, dna, of, all, 41, felid, species, revealed, that, hybridization, between, species, occurred, in, the, course, of, evolution, within, the, majority, of, the, eight, lineages, modelling, of, felid, coat, pattern, transformations, revealed, that, nearly, all, patterns, evolved, from, small, spots, traditionally, five, subfamilies, had, been, distinguished, within, the, felidae, based, on, phenotypical, features, the, pantherinae, the, felinae, the, acinonychinae, and, the, extinct, machairodontinae, and, proailurinae, acinonychinae, used, to, only, contain, the, genus, acinonyx, but, this, genus, is, now, within, the, felinae, subfamily, the, following, cladogram, based, on, piras, et, al, 2013, depicts, the, phylogeny, of, basal,
