traditional, see, evolution, for, families, an, octopus, pl, octopuses, or, octopodes, is, a, soft, bodied, eight, limbed, mollusc, of, the, order, octopoda, k, t, p, d, ok, top, d, the, order, consists, of, some, 300, species, and, is, grouped, within, the, class, cephalopoda, with, squids, cuttlefish, and, nautiloids, like, other, cephalopods, an, octopus, is, bilaterally, symmetric, with, two, eyes, and, a, beaked, mouth, at, the, centre, point, of, the, eight, limbs, the, soft, body, can, radically, alter, its, shape, enabling, octopuses, to, squeeze, through, small, gaps, they, trail, their, eight, appendages, behind, them, as, they, swim, the, siphon, is, used, both, for, respiration, and, for, locomotion, by, expelling, a, jet, of, water, octopuses, have, a, complex, nervous, system, and, excellent, sight, and, are, among, the, most, intelligent, and, behaviourally, diverse, of, all, invertebrates, octopuses, inhabit, various, regions, of, the, ocean, including, coral, reefs, pelagic, waters, and, the, seabed, some, live, in, the, intertidal, zone, and, others, at, abyssal, depths, most, species, grow, quickly, mature, early, and, are, short, lived, in, most, species, the, male, uses, a, specially, adapted, arm, to, deliver, a, bundle, of, sperm, directly, into, the, female, s, mantle, cavity, after, which, he, becomes, senescent, and, dies, while, the, female, deposits, fertilised, eggs, in, a, den, and, cares, for, them, until, they, hatch, after, which, she, also, dies, strategies, to, defend, themselves, against, predators, include, the, expulsion, of, ink, the, use, of, camouflage, and, threat, displays, the, ability, to, jet, quickly, through, the, water, and, hide, and, even, deceit, all, octopuses, are, venomous, but, only, the, blue, ringed, octopuses, are, known, to, be, deadly, to, humans, octopuses, appear, in, mythology, as, sea, monsters, like, the, kraken, of, norway, and, the, akkorokamui, of, the, ainu, and, possibly, the, gorgon, of, ancient, greece, a, battle, with, an, octopus, appears, in, victor, hugo, s, book, toilers, of, the, sea, inspiring, other, works, such, as, ian, fleming, s, octopussy, octopuses, appear, in, japanese, erotic, art, shunga, they, are, eaten, and, considered, a, delicacy, by, humans, in, many, parts, of, the, world, especially, the, mediterranean, and, the, asian, seas, the, scientific, latin, term, octopus, was, derived, from, ancient, greek, okt, pous, a, compound, form, of, okt, eight, and, pous, foot, itself, a, variant, form, of, a, word, used, for, example, by, alexander, of, tralles, c, 525, c, 605, for, the, common, octopus, the, standard, pluralised, form, of, octopus, in, english, is, octopuses, the, ancient, greek, plural, octopodes, k, t, p, d, i, z, has, also, been, used, historically, the, alternative, plural, octopi, is, usually, considered, grammatically, incorrect, because, it, wrongly, assumes, that, octopus, is, a, latin, second, declension, us, noun, or, adjective, when, in, either, greek, or, latin, it, is, a, third, declension, noun, historically, the, first, plural, to, commonly, appear, in, english, language, sources, in, the, early, 19th, century, is, the, latinate, form, octopi, followed, by, the, english, form, octopuses, in, the, latter, half, of, the, same, century, the, hellenic, plural, is, roughly, contemporary, in, usage, although, it, is, also, the, rarest, fowler, s, modern, english, usage, states, that, the, only, acceptable, plural, in, english, is, octopuses, that, octopi, is, misconceived, and, octopodes, pedantic, the, last, is, nonetheless, used, frequently, enough, to, be, acknowledged, by, the, descriptivist, merriam, webster, 11th, collegiate, dictionary, and, webster, s, new, world, college, dictionary, the, oxford, english, dictionary, lists, octopuses, octopi, and, octopodes, in, that, order, reflecting, frequency, of, use, calling, octopodes, rare, and, noting, that, octopi, is, based, on, a, misunderstanding, the, new, oxford, american, dictionary, 3rd, edition, 2010, lists, octopuses, as, the, only, acceptable, pluralisation, and, indicates, that, octopodes, is, still, occasionally, used, but, that, octopi, is, incorrect, the, giant, pacific, octopus, enteroctopus, dofleini, is, often, cited, as, the, largest, known, octopus, species, adults, usually, weigh, around, 15, kg, 33, lb, with, an, arm, span, of, up, to, 4, 3, m, 14, ft, the, largest, specimen, of, this, species, to, be, scientifically, documented, was, an, animal, with, a, live, mass, of, 71, kg, 157, lb, much, larger, sizes, have, been, claimed, for, the, giant, pacific, octopus, one, specimen, was, recorded, as, 272, kg, 600, lb, with, an, arm, span, of, 9, m, 30, ft, a, carcass, of, the, seven, arm, octopus, haliphron, atlanticus, weighed, 61, kg, 134, lb, and, was, estimated, to, have, had, a, live, mass, of, 75, kg, 165, lb, the, smallest, species, is, octopus, wolfi, which, is, around, 2, 5, cm, 1, in, and, weighs, less, than, 1, g, 0, 035, oz, the, octopus, is, bilaterally, symmetrical, along, its, dorso, ventral, back, to, belly, axis, the, head, and, foot, are, at, one, end, of, an, elongated, body, and, function, as, the, anterior, front, of, the, animal, the, head, includes, the, mouth, and, brain, the, foot, has, evolved, into, a, set, of, flexible, prehensile, appendages, known, as, arms, that, surround, the, mouth, and, are, attached, to, each, other, near, their, base, by, a, webbed, structure, the, arms, can, be, described, based, on, side, and, sequence, position, such, as, l1, r1, l2, r2, and, divided, into, four, pairs, the, two, rear, appendages, are, generally, used, to, walk, on, the, sea, floor, while, the, other, six, are, used, to, forage, for, food, the, bulbous, and, hollow, mantle, is, fused, to, the, back, of, the, head, and, is, known, as, the, visceral, hump, it, contains, most, of, the, vital, organs, the, mantle, cavity, has, muscular, walls, and, contains, the, gills, it, is, connected, to, the, exterior, by, a, funnel, or, siphon, the, mouth, of, an, octopus, located, underneath, the, arms, has, a, sharp, hard, beak, the, skin, consists, of, a, thin, outer, epidermis, with, mucous, cells, and, sensory, cells, and, a, connective, tissue, dermis, consisting, largely, of, collagen, fibres, and, various, cells, allowing, colour, change, most, of, the, body, is, made, of, soft, tissue, allowing, it, to, lengthen, contract, and, contort, itself, the, octopus, can, squeeze, through, tiny, gaps, even, the, larger, species, can, pass, through, an, opening, close, to, 2, 5, cm, 1, in, in, diameter, lacking, skeletal, support, the, arms, work, as, muscular, hydrostats, and, contain, longitudinal, transverse, and, circular, muscles, around, a, central, axial, nerve, they, can, extend, and, contract, twist, to, left, or, right, bend, at, any, place, in, any, direction, or, be, held, rigid, the, interior, surfaces, of, the, arms, are, covered, with, circular, adhesive, suckers, the, suckers, allow, the, octopus, to, anchor, itself, or, to, manipulate, objects, each, sucker, is, usually, circular, and, bowl, like, and, has, two, distinct, parts, an, outer, shallow, cavity, called, an, infundibulum, and, a, central, hollow, cavity, called, an, acetabulum, both, of, which, are, thick, muscles, covered, in, a, protective, chitinous, cuticle, when, a, sucker, attaches, to, a, surface, the, orifice, between, the, two, structures, is, sealed, the, infundibulum, provides, adhesion, while, the, acetabulum, remains, free, and, muscle, contractions, allow, for, attachment, and, detachment, each, of, the, eight, arms, senses, and, responds, to, light, allowing, the, octopus, to, control, the, limbs, even, if, its, head, is, obscured, the, eyes, of, the, octopus, are, large, and, at, the, top, of, the, head, they, are, similar, in, structure, to, those, of, a, fish, and, are, enclosed, in, a, cartilaginous, capsule, fused, to, the, cranium, the, cornea, is, formed, from, a, translucent, epidermal, layer, the, slit, shaped, pupil, forms, a, hole, in, the, iris, just, behind, the, cornea, the, lens, is, suspended, behind, the, pupil, photoreceptive, retinal, cells, cover, the, back, of, the, eye, the, pupil, can, be, adjusted, in, size, a, retinal, pigment, screens, incident, light, in, bright, conditions, some, species, differ, in, form, from, the, typical, octopus, body, shape, basal, species, the, cirrina, have, stout, gelatinous, bodies, with, webbing, that, reaches, near, the, tip, of, their, arms, and, two, large, fins, above, the, eyes, supported, by, an, internal, shell, fleshy, papillae, or, cirri, are, found, along, the, bottom, of, the, arms, and, the, eyes, are, more, developed, octopuses, have, a, closed, circulatory, system, in, which, the, blood, remains, inside, blood, vessels, octopuses, have, three, hearts, a, systemic, or, main, heart, that, circulates, blood, around, the, body, and, two, branchial, or, gill, hearts, that, pump, it, through, each, of, the, two, gills, the, systemic, heart, becomes, inactive, when, the, animal, is, swimming, thus, the, octopus, tires, quickly, and, prefers, to, crawl, octopus, blood, contains, the, copper, rich, protein, haemocyanin, to, transport, oxygen, this, makes, the, blood, very, viscous, and, it, requires, considerable, pressure, to, pump, it, around, the, body, octopuses, blood, pressures, can, exceed, 75, mmhg, 10, kpa, in, cold, conditions, with, low, oxygen, levels, haemocyanin, transports, oxygen, more, efficiently, than, haemoglobin, the, haemocyanin, is, dissolved, in, the, plasma, instead, of, being, carried, within, blood, cells, and, gives, the, blood, a, bluish, colour, the, systemic, heart, has, muscular, contractile, walls, and, consists, of, a, single, ventricle, and, two, atria, one, for, each, side, of, the, body, the, blood, vessels, consist, of, arteries, capillaries, and, veins, and, are, lined, with, a, cellular, endothelium, which, is, quite, unlike, that, of, most, other, invertebrates, the, blood, circulates, through, the, aorta, and, capillary, system, to, the, vena, cavae, after, which, the, blood, is, pumped, through, the, gills, by, the, branchial, hearts, and, back, to, the, main, heart, much, of, the, venous, system, is, contractile, which, helps, circulate, the, blood, respiration, involves, drawing, water, into, the, mantle, cavity, through, an, aperture, passing, it, through, the, gills, and, expelling, it, through, the, siphon, the, ingress, of, water, is, achieved, by, contraction, of, radial, muscles, in, the, mantle, wall, and, flapper, valves, shut, when, strong, circular, muscles, force, the, water, out, through, the, siphon, extensive, connective, tissue, lattices, support, the, respiratory, muscles, and, allow, them, to, expand, the, respiratory, chamber, the, lamella, structure, of, the, gills, allows, for, a, high, oxygen, uptake, up, to, 65, in, water, at, 20, c, 68, f, water, flow, over, the, gills, correlates, with, locomotion, and, an, octopus, can, propel, its, body, when, it, expels, water, out, of, its, siphon, the, thin, skin, of, the, octopus, absorbs, additional, oxygen, when, resting, around, 41, of, an, octopus, s, oxygen, absorption, is, through, the, skin, this, decreases, to, 33, when, it, swims, as, more, water, flows, over, the, gills, skin, oxygen, uptake, also, increases, when, it, is, resting, after, a, meal, absorption, through, the, skin, can, drop, to, 3, of, its, total, oxygen, uptake, the, digestive, system, of, the, octopus, begins, with, the, buccal, mass, which, consists, of, the, mouth, with, its, chitinous, beak, the, pharynx, radula, and, salivary, glands, the, radula, is, a, spiked, muscular, tongue, like, organ, with, multiple, rows, of, tiny, teeth, food, is, broken, down, and, is, forced, into, the, oesophagus, by, two, lateral, extensions, of, the, esophageal, side, walls, in, addition, to, the, radula, from, there, it, is, transferred, to, the, gastrointestinal, tract, which, is, mostly, suspended, from, the, roof, of, the, mantle, cavity, by, numerous, membranes, the, tract, consists, of, a, crop, where, the, food, is, stored, a, stomach, where, food, is, ground, down, a, caecum, where, the, now, sludgy, food, is, sorted, into, fluids, and, particles, and, which, plays, an, important, role, in, absorption, the, digestive, gland, where, liver, cells, break, down, and, absorb, the, fluid, and, become, brown, bodies, and, the, intestine, where, the, accumulated, waste, is, turned, into, faecal, ropes, by, secretions, and, blown, out, of, the, funnel, via, the, rectum, during, osmoregulation, fluid, is, added, to, the, pericardia, of, the, branchial, hearts, the, octopus, has, two, nephridia, equivalent, to, vertebrate, kidneys, which, are, associated, with, the, branchial, hearts, these, and, their, associated, ducts, connect, the, pericardial, cavities, with, the, mantle, cavity, before, reaching, the, branchial, heart, each, branch, of, the, vena, cava, expands, to, form, renal, appendages, which, are, in, direct, contact, with, the, thin, walled, nephridium, the, urine, is, first, formed, in, the, pericardial, cavity, and, is, modified, by, excretion, chiefly, of, ammonia, and, selective, absorption, from, the, renal, appendages, as, it, is, passed, along, the, associated, duct, and, through, the, nephridiopore, into, the, mantle, cavity, octopuses, along, with, cuttlefish, have, the, highest, brain, to, body, mass, ratios, of, all, invertebrates, this, is, greater, than, that, of, many, vertebrates, octopuses, have, the, same, jumping, genes, that, are, active, in, the, human, brain, implying, an, evolutionary, convergence, at, molecular, level, the, nervous, system, is, complex, only, part, of, which, is, localised, in, its, brain, which, is, contained, in, a, cartilaginous, capsule, two, thirds, of, an, octopus, s, neurons, are, in, the, nerve, cords, of, its, arms, this, allows, their, arms, to, perform, complex, reflex, actions, without, input, from, the, brain, unlike, vertebrates, the, complex, motor, skills, of, octopuses, are, not, organised, in, their, brains, via, internal, somatotopic, maps, of, their, bodies, the, nervous, system, of, cephalopods, is, the, most, complex, of, all, invertebrates, the, giant, nerve, fibers, of, the, cephalopod, mantle, have, been, widely, used, for, many, years, as, experimental, material, in, neurophysiology, their, large, diameter, due, to, lack, of, myelination, makes, them, relatively, easy, to, study, compared, with, other, animals, like, other, cephalopods, octopuses, have, camera, like, eyes, and, can, distinguish, the, polarisation, of, light, colour, vision, appears, to, vary, from, species, to, species, for, example, being, present, in, o, aegina, but, absent, in, o, vulgaris, opsins, in, the, skin, respond, to, different, wavelengths, of, light, and, help, the, animals, choose, a, colouration, that, camouflages, them, the, chromatophores, in, the, skin, can, respond, to, light, independently, of, the, eyes, an, alternative, hypothesis, is, that, cephalopod, eyes, in, species, that, only, have, a, single, photoreceptor, protein, may, use, chromatic, aberration, to, turn, monochromatic, vision, into, colour, vision, though, this, sacrifices, image, quality, this, would, explain, pupils, shaped, like, the, letter, u, the, letter, w, or, a, dumbbell, as, well, as, the, need, for, colourful, mating, displays, attached, to, the, brain, are, two, organs, called, statocysts, sac, like, structures, containing, a, mineralised, mass, and, sensitive, hairs, that, allow, the, octopus, to, sense, the, orientation, of, its, body, they, provide, information, on, the, position, of, the, body, relative, to, gravity, and, can, detect, angular, acceleration, an, autonomic, response, keeps, the, octopus, s, eyes, oriented, so, that, the, pupil, is, always, horizontal, octopuses, may, also, use, the, statocyst, to, hear, sound, the, common, octopus, can, hear, sounds, between, 400, hz, and, 1000, hz, and, hears, best, at, 600, hz, octopuses, have, an, excellent, somatosensory, system, their, suction, cups, are, equipped, with, chemoreceptors, so, they, can, taste, what, they, touch, octopus, arms, move, easily, because, the, sensors, recognise, octopus, skin, and, prevent, self, attachment, octopuses, appear, to, have, poor, proprioceptive, sense, and, must, observe, the, arms, visually, to, keep, track, of, their, position, the, ink, sac, of, an, octopus, is, located, under, the, digestive, gland, a, gland, attached, to, the, sac, produces, the, ink, and, the, sac, stores, it, the, sac, is, close, enough, to, the, funnel, for, the, octopus, to, shoot, out, the, ink, with, a, water, jet, before, it, leaves, the, funnel, the, ink, passes, through, glands, which, mix, it, with, mucus, creating, a, thick, dark, blob, which, allows, the, animal, to, escape, from, a, predator, the, main, pigment, in, the, ink, is, melanin, which, gives, it, its, black, colour, cirrate, octopuses, usually, lack, the, ink, sac, octopuses, are, gonochoric, and, have, a, single, posteriorly, located, gonad, which, is, associated, with, the, coelom, the, testis, in, males, and, the, ovary, in, females, bulges, into, the, gonocoel, and, the, gametes, are, released, here, the, gonocoel, is, connected, by, the, gonoduct, to, the, mantle, cavity, which, it, enters, at, the, gonopore, an, optic, gland, creates, hormones, that, cause, the, octopus, to, mature, and, age, and, stimulate, gamete, production, the, gland, may, be, triggered, by, environmental, conditions, such, as, temperature, light, and, nutrition, which, thus, control, the, timing, of, reproduction, and, lifespan, when, octopuses, reproduce, the, male, uses, a, specialised, arm, called, a, hectocotylus, to, transfer, spermatophores, packets, of, sperm, from, the, terminal, organ, of, the, reproductive, tract, the, cephalopod, penis, into, the, female, s, mantle, cavity, the, hectocotylus, in, benthic, octopuses, is, usually, the, third, right, arm, which, has, a, spoon, shaped, depression, and, modified, suckers, near, the, tip, in, most, species, fertilisation, occurs, in, the, mantle, cavity, the, reproduction, of, octopuses, has, been, studied, in, only, a, few, species, one, such, species, is, the, giant, pacific, octopus, in, which, courtship, is, accompanied, especially, in, the, male, by, changes, in, skin, texture, and, colour, the, male, may, cling, to, the, top, or, side, of, the, female, or, position, himself, beside, her, there, is, some, speculation, that, he, may, first, use, his, hectocotylus, to, remove, any, spermatophore, or, sperm, already, present, in, the, female, he, picks, up, a, spermatophore, from, his, spermatophoric, sac, with, the, hectocotylus, inserts, it, into, the, female, s, mantle, cavity, and, deposits, it, in, the, correct, location, for, the, species, which, in, the, giant, pacific, octopus, is, the, opening, of, the, oviduct, two, spermatophores, are, transferred, in, this, way, these, are, about, one, metre, yard, long, and, the, empty, ends, may, protrude, from, the, female, s, mantle, a, complex, hydraulic, mechanism, releases, the, sperm, from, the, spermatophore, and, it, is, stored, internally, by, the, female, about, forty, days, after, mating, the, female, giant, pacific, octopus, attaches, strings, of, small, fertilised, eggs, 10, 000, to, 70, 000, in, total, to, rocks, in, a, crevice, or, under, an, overhang, here, she, guards, and, cares, for, them, for, about, five, months, 160, days, until, they, hatch, in, colder, waters, such, as, those, off, alaska, it, may, take, up, to, ten, months, for, the, eggs, to, completely, develop, 74, the, female, aerates, them, and, keeps, them, clean, if, left, untended, many, will, die, she, does, not, feed, during, this, time, and, dies, soon, after, males, become, senescent, and, die, a, few, weeks, after, mating, the, eggs, have, large, yolks, cleavage, division, is, superficial, and, a, germinal, disc, develops, at, the, pole, during, gastrulation, the, margins, of, this, grow, down, and, surround, the, yolk, forming, a, yolk, sac, which, eventually, forms, part, of, the, gut, the, dorsal, side, of, the, disc, grows, upward, and, forms, the, embryo, with, a, shell, gland, on, its, dorsal, surface, gills, mantle, and, eyes, the, arms, and, funnel, develop, as, part, of, the, foot, on, the, ventral, side, of, the, disc, the, arms, later, migrate, upward, coming, to, form, a, ring, around, the, funnel, and, mouth, the, yolk, is, gradually, absorbed, as, the, embryo, develops, most, young, octopuses, hatch, as, paralarvae, and, are, planktonic, for, weeks, to, months, depending, on, the, species, and, water, temperature, they, feed, on, copepods, arthropod, larvae, and, other, zooplankton, eventually, settling, on, the, ocean, floor, and, developing, directly, into, adults, with, no, distinct, metamorphoses, that, are, present, in, other, groups, of, mollusc, larvae, octopus, species, that, produce, larger, eggs, including, the, southern, blue, ringed, caribbean, reef, california, two, spot, eledone, moschata, and, deep, sea, octopuses, instead, hatch, as, benthic, animals, similar, to, the, adults, 74, 75, in, the, argonaut, paper, nautilus, the, female, secretes, a, fine, fluted, papery, shell, in, which, the, eggs, are, deposited, and, in, which, she, also, resides, while, floating, in, mid, ocean, in, this, she, broods, the, young, and, it, also, serves, as, a, buoyancy, aid, allowing, her, to, adjust, her, depth, the, male, argonaut, is, minute, by, comparison, and, has, no, shell, octopuses, have, short, lifespans, and, some, species, complete, their, lifecycles, in, only, six, months, the, giant, pacific, octopus, one, of, the, two, largest, species, of, octopus, usually, lives, for, three, to, five, years, octopus, lifespan, is, limited, by, reproduction, for, most, octopuses, the, last, stage, of, their, life, is, called, senescence, it, is, the, breakdown, of, cellular, function, without, repair, or, replacement, for, males, this, typically, begins, after, mating, senescence, may, last, from, weeks, to, a, few, months, at, most, for, females, it, begins, when, they, lay, a, clutch, of, eggs, females, will, spend, all, their, time, aerating, and, protecting, their, eggs, until, they, are, ready, to, hatch, during, senescence, an, octopus, does, not, feed, and, quickly, weakens, lesions, begin, to, form, and, the, octopus, literally, degenerates, unable, to, defend, themselves, octopuses, often, fall, prey, to, predators, this, makes, most, octopuses, effectively, semelparous, the, larger, pacific, striped, octopus, lpso, is, an, exception, as, it, can, reproduce, repeatedly, over, a, life, of, around, two, years, octopus, reproductive, organs, mature, due, to, the, hormonal, influence, of, the, optic, gland, but, result, in, the, inactivation, of, their, digestive, glands, unable, to, feed, the, octopus, typically, dies, of, starvation, experimental, removal, of, both, optic, glands, after, spawning, was, found, to, result, in, the, cessation, of, broodiness, the, resumption, of, feeding, increased, growth, and, greatly, extended, lifespans, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, naturally, short, lifespan, may, be, functional, to, prevent, rapid, overpopulation, octopuses, live, in, every, ocean, and, different, species, have, adapted, to, different, marine, habitats, as, juveniles, common, octopuses, inhabit, shallow, tide, pools, the, hawaiian, day, octopus, octopus, cyanea, lives, on, coral, reefs, argonauts, drift, in, pelagic, waters, abdopus, aculeatus, mostly, lives, in, near, shore, seagrass, beds, some, species, are, adapted, to, the, cold, ocean, depths, the, spoon, armed, octopus, bathypolypus, arcticus, is, found, at, depths, of, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, and, vulcanoctopus, hydrothermalis, lives, near, hydrothermal, vents, at, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, the, cirrate, species, are, often, free, swimming, and, live, in, deep, water, habitats, although, several, species, are, known, to, live, at, bathyal, and, abyssal, depths, there, is, only, a, single, indisputable, record, of, an, octopus, in, the, hadal, zone, a, species, of, grimpoteuthis, dumbo, octopus, photographed, at, 6, 957, m, 22, 825, ft, no, species, are, known, to, live, in, fresh, water, most, species, are, solitary, when, not, mating, though, a, few, are, known, to, occur, in, high, densities, and, with, frequent, interactions, such, as, signaling, mate, defending, and, evicting, individuals, from, dens, this, is, likely, the, result, of, abundant, food, supplies, combined, with, limited, den, sites, the, lpso, has, been, described, as, particularly, social, living, in, groups, of, up, to, 40, individuals, octopuses, hide, in, dens, which, are, typically, crevices, in, rocky, outcrops, or, other, hard, structures, though, some, species, burrow, into, sand, or, mud, octopuses, are, not, territorial, but, generally, remain, in, a, home, range, they, may, leave, in, search, of, food, they, can, navigate, back, to, a, den, without, having, to, retrace, their, outward, route, they, are, not, migratory, octopuses, bring, captured, prey, to, the, den, where, they, can, eat, it, safely, sometimes, the, octopus, catches, more, prey, than, it, can, eat, and, the, den, is, often, surrounded, by, a, midden, of, dead, and, uneaten, food, items, other, creatures, such, as, fish, crabs, molluscs, and, echinoderms, often, share, the, den, with, the, octopus, either, because, they, have, arrived, as, scavengers, or, because, they, have, survived, capture, on, rare, occasions, octopuses, hunt, cooperatively, with, other, species, with, fish, as, their, partners, they, regulate, the, species, composition, of, the, hunting, group, and, the, behavior, of, their, partners, by, punching, them, nearly, all, octopuses, are, predatory, bottom, dwelling, octopuses, eat, mainly, crustaceans, polychaete, worms, and, other, molluscs, such, as, whelks, and, clams, open, ocean, octopuses, eat, mainly, prawns, fish, and, other, cephalopods, major, items, in, the, diet, of, the, giant, pacific, octopus, include, bivalve, molluscs, such, as, the, cockle, clinocardium, nuttallii, clams, and, scallops, and, crustaceans, such, as, crabs, and, spider, crabs, prey, that, it, is, likely, to, reject, include, moon, snails, because, they, are, too, large, and, limpets, rock, scallops, chitons, and, abalone, because, they, are, too, securely, fixed, to, the, rock, small, cirrate, octopuses, such, as, those, of, the, genera, grimpoteuthis, and, opisthoteuthis, typically, prey, on, polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, and, isopods, a, benthic, bottom, dwelling, octopus, typically, moves, among, the, rocks, and, feels, through, the, crevices, the, creature, may, make, a, jet, propelled, pounce, on, prey, and, pull, it, toward, the, mouth, with, its, arms, the, suckers, restraining, it, small, prey, may, be, completely, trapped, by, the, webbed, structure, octopuses, usually, inject, crustaceans, like, crabs, with, a, paralysing, saliva, then, dismember, them, with, their, beaks, octopuses, feed, on, shelled, molluscs, either, by, forcing, the, valves, apart, or, by, drilling, a, hole, in, the, shell, to, inject, a, nerve, toxin, it, used, to, be, thought, that, the, hole, was, drilled, by, the, radula, but, it, has, now, been, shown, that, minute, teeth, at, the, tip, of, the, salivary, papilla, are, involved, and, an, enzyme, in, the, toxic, saliva, is, used, to, dissolve, the, calcium, carbonate, of, the, shell, it, takes, about, three, hours, for, o, vulgaris, to, create, a, 0, 6, mm, 0, 024, in, hole, once, the, shell, is, penetrated, the, prey, dies, almost, instantaneously, its, muscles, relax, and, the, soft, tissues, are, easy, for, the, octopus, to, remove, crabs, may, also, be, treated, in, this, way, tough, shelled, species, are, more, likely, to, be, drilled, and, soft, shelled, crabs, are, torn, apart, some, species, have, other, modes, of, feeding, grimpoteuthis, has, a, reduced, or, non, existent, radula, and, swallows, prey, whole, in, the, deep, sea, genus, stauroteuthis, some, of, the, muscle, cells, that, control, the, suckers, in, most, species, have, been, replaced, with, photophores, which, are, believed, to, fool, prey, by, directing, them, to, the, mouth, making, them, one, of, the, few, bioluminescent, octopuses, octopuses, mainly, move, about, by, relatively, slow, crawling, with, some, swimming, in, a, head, first, position, jet, propulsion, or, backward, swimming, is, their, fastest, means, of, locomotion, followed, by, swimming, and, crawling, when, in, no, hurry, they, usually, crawl, on, either, solid, or, soft, surfaces, several, arms, are, extended, forward, some, of, the, suckers, adhere, to, the, substrate, and, the, animal, hauls, itself, forward, with, its, powerful, arm, muscles, while, other, arms, may, push, rather, than, pull, as, progress, is, made, other, arms, move, ahead, to, repeat, these, actions, and, the, original, suckers, detach, during, crawling, the, heart, rate, nearly, doubles, and, the, animal, requires, ten, or, fifteen, minutes, to, recover, from, relatively, minor, exercise, most, octopuses, swim, by, expelling, a, jet, of, water, from, the, mantle, through, the, siphon, into, the, sea, the, physical, principle, behind, this, is, that, the, force, required, to, accelerate, the, water, through, the, orifice, produces, a, reaction, that, propels, the, octopus, in, the, opposite, direction, the, direction, of, travel, depends, on, the, orientation, of, the, siphon, when, swimming, the, head, is, at, the, front, and, the, siphon, is, pointed, backward, but, when, jetting, the, visceral, hump, leads, the, siphon, points, at, the, head, and, the, arms, trail, behind, with, the, animal, presenting, a, fusiform, appearance, in, an, alternative, method, of, swimming, some, species, flatten, themselves, dorso, ventrally, and, swim, with, the, arms, held, out, sideways, this, may, provide, lift, and, be, faster, than, normal, swimming, jetting, is, used, to, escape, from, danger, but, is, physiologically, inefficient, requiring, a, mantle, pressure, so, high, as, to, stop, the, heart, from, beating, resulting, in, a, progressive, oxygen, deficit, cirrate, octopuses, cannot, produce, jet, propulsion, and, rely, on, their, fins, for, swimming, they, have, neutral, buoyancy, and, drift, through, the, water, with, the, fins, extended, they, can, also, contract, their, arms, and, surrounding, web, to, make, sudden, moves, known, as, take, offs, another, form, of, locomotion, is, pumping, which, involves, symmetrical, contractions, of, muscles, in, their, webs, producing, peristaltic, waves, this, moves, the, body, slowly, in, 2005, adopus, aculeatus, and, veined, octopus, amphioctopus, marginatus, were, found, to, walk, on, two, arms, while, at, the, same, time, mimicking, plant, matter, this, form, of, locomotion, allows, these, octopuses, to, move, quickly, away, from, a, potential, predator, without, being, recognised, some, species, of, octopus, can, crawl, out, of, the, water, briefly, which, they, may, do, between, tide, pools, stilt, walking, is, used, by, the, veined, octopus, when, carrying, stacked, coconut, shells, the, octopus, carries, the, shells, underneath, it, with, two, arms, and, progresses, with, an, ungainly, gait, supported, by, its, remaining, arms, held, rigid, octopuses, are, highly, intelligent, maze, and, problem, solving, experiments, have, shown, evidence, of, a, memory, system, that, can, store, both, short, and, long, term, memory, young, octopuses, learn, nothing, from, their, parents, as, adults, provide, no, parental, care, beyond, tending, to, their, eggs, until, the, young, octopuses, hatch, 75, in, laboratory, experiments, octopuses, can, readily, be, trained, to, distinguish, between, different, shapes, and, patterns, they, have, been, reported, to, practise, observational, learning, although, the, validity, of, these, findings, is, contested, octopuses, have, also, been, observed, in, what, has, been, described, as, play, repeatedly, releasing, bottles, or, toys, into, a, circular, current, in, their, aquariums, and, then, catching, them, octopuses, often, break, out, of, their, aquariums, and, sometimes, into, others, in, search, of, food, growing, evidence, suggests, that, octopuses, are, sentient, and, capable, of, experiencing, pain, the, veined, octopus, collects, discarded, coconut, shells, then, uses, them, to, build, a, shelter, an, example, of, tool, use, octopuses, use, camouflage, when, hunting, and, to, avoid, predators, to, do, this, they, use, specialised, skin, cells, that, change, the, appearance, of, the, skin, by, adjusting, its, colour, opacity, or, reflectivity, chromatophores, contain, yellow, orange, red, brown, or, black, pigments, most, species, have, three, of, these, colours, while, some, have, two, or, four, other, colour, changing, cells, are, reflective, iridophores, and, white, leucophores, this, colour, changing, ability, is, also, used, to, communicate, with, or, warn, other, octopuses, octopuses, can, create, distracting, patterns, with, waves, of, dark, colouration, across, the, body, a, display, known, as, the, passing, cloud, muscles, in, the, skin, change, the, texture, of, the, mantle, to, achieve, greater, camouflage, in, some, species, the, mantle, can, take, on, the, spiky, appearance, of, algae, in, others, skin, anatomy, is, limited, to, relatively, uniform, shades, of, one, colour, with, limited, skin, texture, octopuses, that, are, diurnal, and, live, in, shallow, water, have, evolved, more, complex, skin, than, their, nocturnal, and, deep, sea, counterparts, a, moving, rock, trick, involves, the, octopus, mimicking, a, rock, and, then, inching, across, the, open, space, with, a, speed, matching, that, of, the, surrounding, water, aside, from, humans, octopuses, may, be, preyed, on, by, fishes, seabirds, sea, otters, pinnipeds, cetaceans, and, other, cephalopods, octopuses, typically, hide, or, disguise, themselves, by, camouflage, and, mimicry, some, have, conspicuous, warning, coloration, aposematism, or, deimatic, behaviour, bluffing, a, seemingly, threatening, appearance, an, octopus, may, spend, 40, of, its, time, hidden, away, in, its, den, when, the, octopus, is, approached, it, may, extend, an, arm, to, investigate, 66, of, enteroctopus, dofleini, in, one, study, had, scars, with, 50, having, amputated, arms, the, blue, rings, of, the, highly, venomous, blue, ringed, octopus, are, hidden, in, muscular, skin, folds, which, contract, when, the,

been, seen, by, a, predator, they, commonly, try, to, escape, but, can, also, create, a, distraction, by, ejecting, an, ink, cloud, from, their, ink, sac, the, ink, is, thought, to, reduce, the, efficiency, of, olfactory, organs, which, would, aid, evasion, from, predators, that, employ, smell, for, hunting, such, as, sharks, ink, clouds, of, some, species, might, act, as, pseudomorphs, or, decoys, that, the, predator, attacks, instead, when, under, attack, some, octopuses, can, perform, arm, autotomy, in, a, manner, similar, to, the, way, skinks, and, other, lizards, detach, their, tails, the, crawling, arm, may, distract, would, be, predators, such, severed, arms, remain, sensitive, to, stimuli, and, move, away, from, unpleasant, sensations, octopuses, can, replace, lost, limbs, some, octopuses, such, as, the, mimic, octopus, can, combine, their, highly, flexible, bodies, with, their, colour, changing, ability, to, mimic, other, more, dangerous, animals, such, as, lionfish, sea, snakes, and, eels, the, diseases, and, parasites, that, affect, octopuses, have, been, little, studied, but, cephalopods, are, known, to, be, the, intermediate, or, final, hosts, of, various, parasitic, cestodes, nematodes, and, copepods, 150, species, of, protistan, and, metazoan, parasites, have, been, recognised, the, dicyemidae, are, a, family, of, tiny, worms, that, are, found, in, the, renal, appendages, of, many, species, it, is, unclear, whether, they, are, parasitic, or, endosymbionts, coccidians, in, the, genus, aggregata, living, in, the, gut, cause, severe, disease, to, the, host, octopuses, have, an, innate, immune, system, their, haemocytes, respond, to, infection, by, phagocytosis, encapsulation, infiltration, or, cytotoxic, activities, to, destroy, or, isolate, the, pathogens, the, haemocytes, play, an, important, role, in, the, recognition, and, elimination, of, foreign, bodies, and, wound, repair, captive, animals, are, more, susceptible, to, pathogens, than, wild, ones, a, gram, negative, bacterium, vibrio, lentus, can, cause, skin, lesions, exposure, of, muscle, and, sometimes, death, the, scientific, name, octopoda, was, first, coined, and, given, as, the, order, of, octopuses, in, 1818, by, english, biologist, william, elford, leach, who, classified, them, as, octopoida, the, previous, year, the, octopoda, consists, of, around, 300, known, species, and, were, historically, divided, into, two, suborders, the, incirrina, and, the, cirrina, more, recent, evidence, suggests, cirrina, is, merely, the, most, basal, species, not, a, unique, clade, the, incirrate, octopuses, the, majority, of, species, lack, the, cirri, and, paired, swimming, fins, of, the, cirrates, in, addition, the, internal, shell, of, incirrates, is, either, present, as, a, pair, of, stylets, or, absent, altogether, the, cephalopoda, evolved, from, a, mollusc, resembling, the, monoplacophora, in, the, cambrian, some, 530, million, years, ago, the, coleoidea, diverged, from, the, nautiloids, in, the, devonian, some, 416, million, years, ago, in, turn, the, coleoids, including, the, squids, and, octopods, brought, their, shells, inside, the, body, and, some, 276, million, years, ago, during, the, permian, split, into, the, vampyropoda, and, the, decabrachia, the, octopuses, arose, from, the, muensterelloidea, within, the, vampyropoda, in, the, jurassic, the, earliest, octopus, likely, lived, near, the, sea, floor, benthic, to, demersal, in, shallow, marine, environments, octopuses, consist, mostly, of, soft, tissue, and, so, fossils, are, relatively, rare, as, soft, bodied, cephalopods, they, lack, the, external, shell, of, most, molluscs, including, other, cephalopods, like, the, nautiloids, and, the, extinct, ammonoidea, they, have, eight, limbs, like, other, coleoidea, but, lack, the, extra, specialised, feeding, appendages, known, as, tentacles, which, are, longer, and, thinner, with, suckers, only, at, their, club, like, ends, the, vampire, squid, vampyroteuthis, also, lacks, tentacles, but, has, sensory, filaments, the, cladograms, are, based, on, sanchez, et, al, 2018, who, created, a, molecular, phylogeny, based, on, mitochondrial, and, nuclear, dna, marker, sequences, the, position, of, the, eledonidae, is, from, ib, ez, et, al, 2020, with, a, similar, methodology, dates, of, divergence, are, from, kr, ger, et, al, 2011, and, fuchs, et, al, 2019, nautilus, squids, and, cuttlefish, the, molecular, analysis, of, the, octopods, shows, that, the, suborder, cirrina, cirromorphida, and, the, superfamily, argonautoidea, are, paraphyletic, and, are, broken, up, these, names, are, shown, in, quotation, marks, and, italics, on, the, cladogram, cirroteuthidae, stauroteuthidae, opisthoteuthidae, cirroctopodidae, tremoctopodidae, alloposidae, argonautidae, ocythoidae, eledonidae, bathypolypodidae, enteroctopodidae, octopodidae, megaleledonidae, bolitaenidae, amphitretidae, vitreledonellidae, octopuses, like, other, coleoid, cephalopods, but, unlike, more, basal, cephalopods, or, other, molluscs, are, capable, of, greater, rna, editing, changing, the, nucleic, acid, sequence, of, the, primary, transcript, of, rna, molecules, than, any, other, organisms, editing, is, concentrated, in, the, nervous, system, and, affects, proteins, involved, in, neural, excitability, and, neuronal, morphology, more, than, 60, of, rna, transcripts, for, coleoid, brains, are, recoded, by, editing, compared, to, less, than, 1, for, a, human, or, fruit, fly, coleoids, rely, mostly, on, adar, enzymes, for, rna, editing, which, requires, large, double, stranded, rna, structures, to, flank, the, editing, sites, both, the, structures, and, editing, sites, are, conserved, in, the, coleoid, genome, and, the, mutation, rates, for, the, sites, are, severely, hampered, hence, greater, transcriptome, plasticity, has, come, at, the, cost, of, slower, genome, evolution, the, octopus, genome, is, unremarkably, bilaterian, except, for, large, developments, of, two, gene, families, protocadherins, which, regulate, the, development, of, neurons, and, the, c2h2, zinc, finger, transcription, factors, many, genes, specific, to, cephalopods, are, expressed, in, the, animals, skin, suckers, and, nervous, system, ancient, seafaring, people, were, aware, of, the, octopus, as, evidenced, by, artworks, and, designs, for, example, a, stone, carving, found, in, the, archaeological, recovery, from, bronze, age, minoan, crete, at, knossos, 1900, 1100, bc, depicts, a, fisherman, carrying, an, octopus, the, terrifyingly, powerful, gorgon, of, greek, mythology, may, have, been, inspired, by, the, octopus, or, squid, the, octopus, itself, representing, the, severed, head, of, medusa, the, beak, as, the, protruding, tongue, and, fangs, and, its, tentacles, as, the, snakes, the, kraken, are, legendary, sea, monsters, of, giant, proportions, said, to, dwell, off, the, coasts, of, norway, and, greenland, usually, portrayed, in, art, as, giant, octopuses, attacking, ships, linnaeus, included, it, in, the, first, edition, of, his, 1735, systema, naturae, one, translation, of, the, hawaiian, creation, myth, the, kumulipo, suggests, that, the, octopus, is, the, lone, survivor, of, a, previous, age, the, akkorokamui, is, a, gigantic, octopus, like, monster, from, ainu, folklore, worshipped, in, shinto, a, battle, with, an, octopus, plays, a, significant, role, in, victor, hugo, s, 1866, book, travailleurs, de, la, mer, toilers, of, the, sea, ian, fleming, s, 1966, short, story, collection, octopussy, and, the, living, daylights, and, the, 1983, james, bond, film, were, partly, inspired, by, hugo, s, book, japanese, erotic, art, shunga, includes, ukiyo, e, woodblock, prints, such, as, katsushika, hokusai, s, 1814, print, tako, to, ama, the, dream, of, the, fisherman, s, wife, in, which, an, ama, diver, is, sexually, intertwined, with, a, large, and, a, small, octopus, the, print, is, a, forerunner, of, tentacle, erotica, the, biologist, p, z, myers, noted, in, his, science, blog, pharyngula, that, octopuses, appear, in, extraordinary, graphic, illustrations, involving, women, tentacles, and, bare, breasts, since, it, has, numerous, arms, emanating, from, a, common, centre, the, octopus, is, often, used, as, a, symbol, for, a, powerful, and, manipulative, organisation, company, or, country, the, beatles, song, octopus, s, garden, on, the, band, s, 1969, album, abbey, road, was, written, by, ringo, starr, after, he, was, told, about, how, octopuses, travel, along, the, sea, bed, picking, up, stones, and, shiny, objects, with, which, to, build, gardens, octopuses, generally, avoid, humans, but, incidents, have, been, verified, for, example, a, 2, 4, metre, 8, ft, pacific, octopus, said, to, be, nearly, perfectly, camouflaged, lunged, at, a, diver, and, wrangled, over, his, camera, before, it, let, go, another, diver, recorded, the, encounter, on, video, all, species, are, venomous, but, only, blue, ringed, octopuses, have, venom, that, is, lethal, to, humans, blue, ringed, octopuses, are, among, the, deadliest, animals, in, the, sea, their, bites, are, reported, each, year, across, the, animals, range, from, australia, to, the, eastern, indo, pacific, ocean, they, bite, only, when, provoked, or, accidentally, stepped, upon, bites, are, small, and, usually, painless, the, venom, appears, to, be, able, to, penetrate, the, skin, without, a, puncture, given, prolonged, contact, it, contains, tetrodotoxin, which, causes, paralysis, by, blocking, the, transmission, of, nerve, impulses, to, the, muscles, this, causes, death, by, respiratory, failure, leading, to, cerebral, anoxia, no, antidote, is, known, but, if, breathing, can, be, kept, going, artificially, patients, recover, within, 24, hours, bites, have, been, recorded, from, captive, octopuses, of, other, species, they, leave, swellings, which, disappear, in, a, day, or, two, octopus, fisheries, exist, around, the, world, with, total, catches, varying, between, 245, 320, and, 322, 999, metric, tons, from, 1986, to, 1995, the, world, catch, peaked, in, 2007, at, 380, 000, tons, and, had, fallen, by, a, tenth, by, 2012, methods, to, capture, octopuses, include, pots, traps, trawls, snares, drift, fishing, spearing, hooking, and, hand, collection, octopuses, have, a, food, conversion, efficiency, greater, than, that, of, chickens, making, octopus, aquaculture, a, possibility, octopuses, compete, with, human, fisheries, targeting, other, species, and, even, rob, traps, and, nets, for, their, catch, they, may, themselves, be, caught, as, bycatch, if, they, cannot, get, away, octopus, is, eaten, in, many, cultures, such, as, those, on, the, mediterranean, and, asian, coasts, the, arms, and, other, body, parts, are, prepared, in, ways, that, vary, by, species, and, geography, live, octopuses, or, their, wriggling, pieces, are, consumed, as, ikizukuri, in, japanese, cuisine, and, san, nakji, in, korean, cuisine, if, not, prepared, properly, however, the, severed, arms, can, still, choke, the, diner, with, their, suction, cups, causing, at, least, one, death, in, 2010, animal, welfare, groups, have, objected, to, the, live, consumption, of, octopuses, on, the, basis, that, they, can, experience, pain, in, classical, greece, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, commented, on, the, colour, changing, abilities, of, the, octopus, both, for, camouflage, and, for, signalling, in, his, historia, animalium, the, octopus, seeks, its, prey, by, so, changing, its, colour, as, to, render, it, like, the, colour, of, the, stones, adjacent, to, it, it, does, so, also, when, alarmed, aristotle, noted, that, the, octopus, had, a, hectocotyl, arm, and, suggested, it, might, be, used, in, sexual, reproduction, this, claim, was, widely, disbelieved, until, the, 19th, century, it, was, described, in, 1829, by, the, french, zoologist, georges, cuvier, who, supposed, it, to, be, a, parasitic, worm, naming, it, as, a, new, species, hectocotylus, octopodis, other, zoologists, thought, it, a, spermatophore, the, german, zoologist, heinrich, m, ller, believed, it, was, designed, to, detach, during, copulation, in, 1856, the, danish, zoologist, japetus, steenstrup, demonstrated, that, it, is, used, to, transfer, sperm, and, only, rarely, detaches, octopuses, offer, many, possibilities, in, biological, research, including, their, ability, to, regenerate, limbs, change, the, colour, of, their, skin, behave, intelligently, with, a, distributed, nervous, system, and, make, use, of, 168, kinds, of, protocadherins, humans, have, 58, the, proteins, that, guide, the, connections, neurons, make, with, each, other, the, california, two, spot, octopus, has, had, its, genome, sequenced, allowing, exploration, of, its, molecular, adaptations, having, independently, evolved, mammal, like, intelligence, octopuses, have, been, compared, by, the, philosopher, peter, godfrey, smith, who, has, studied, the, nature, of, intelligence, to, hypothetical, intelligent, extraterrestrials, their, problem, solving, skills, along, with, their, mobility, and, lack, of, rigid, structure, enable, them, to, escape, from, supposedly, secure, tanks, in, laboratories, and, public, aquariums, due, to, their, intelligence, octopuses, are, listed, in, some, countries, as, experimental, animals, on, which, surgery, may, not, be, performed, without, anesthesia, a, protection, usually, extended, only, to, vertebrates, in, the, uk, from, 1993, to, 2012, the, common, octopus, octopus, vulgaris, was, the, only, invertebrate, protected, under, the, animals, scientific, procedures, act, 1986, in, 2012, this, legislation, was, extended, to, include, all, cephalopods, in, accordance, with, a, general, eu, directive, some, robotics, research, is, exploring, biomimicry, of, octopus, features, octopus, arms, can, move, and, sense, largely, autonomously, without, intervention, from, the, animal, s, central, nervous, system, in, 2015, a, team, in, italy, built, soft, bodied, robots, able, to, crawl, and, swim, requiring, only, minimal, computation, in, 2017, a, german, company, made, an, arm, with, a, soft, pneumatically, controlled, silicone, gripper, fitted, with, two, rows, of, suckers, it,
