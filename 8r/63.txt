the, heart, is, a, muscular, organ, found, in, most, animals, this, organ, pumps, blood, through, the, blood, vessels, of, the, circulatory, system, the, pumped, blood, carries, oxygen, and, nutrients, to, the, body, while, carrying, metabolic, waste, such, as, carbon, dioxide, to, the, lungs, in, humans, the, heart, is, approximately, the, size, of, a, closed, fist, and, is, located, between, the, lungs, in, the, middle, compartment, of, the, chest, called, the, mediastinum, in, humans, other, mammals, and, birds, the, heart, is, divided, into, four, chambers, upper, left, and, right, atria, and, lower, left, and, right, ventricles, commonly, the, right, atrium, and, ventricle, are, referred, together, as, the, right, heart, and, their, left, counterparts, as, the, left, heart, fish, in, contrast, have, two, chambers, an, atrium, and, a, ventricle, while, most, reptiles, have, three, chambers, in, a, healthy, heart, blood, flows, one, way, through, the, heart, due, to, heart, valves, which, prevent, backflow, the, heart, is, enclosed, in, a, protective, sac, the, pericardium, which, also, contains, a, small, amount, of, fluid, the, wall, of, the, heart, is, made, up, of, three, layers, epicardium, myocardium, and, endocardium, in, all, vertebrates, the, heart, has, an, asymmetric, orientation, almost, always, on, the, left, side, according, to, one, theory, this, is, caused, by, a, developmental, axial, twist, in, the, early, embryo, the, heart, pumps, blood, with, a, rhythm, determined, by, a, group, of, pacemaker, cells, in, the, sinoatrial, node, these, generate, an, electric, current, that, causes, the, heart, to, contract, traveling, through, the, atrioventricular, node, and, along, the, conduction, system, of, the, heart, in, humans, deoxygenated, blood, enters, the, heart, through, the, right, atrium, from, the, superior, and, inferior, venae, cavae, and, passes, to, the, right, ventricle, from, here, it, is, pumped, into, pulmonary, circulation, to, the, lungs, where, it, receives, oxygen, and, gives, off, carbon, dioxide, oxygenated, blood, then, returns, to, the, left, atrium, passes, through, the, left, ventricle, and, is, pumped, out, through, the, aorta, into, systemic, circulation, traveling, through, arteries, arterioles, and, capillaries, where, nutrients, and, other, substances, are, exchanged, between, blood, vessels, and, cells, losing, oxygen, and, gaining, carbon, dioxide, before, being, returned, to, the, heart, through, venules, and, veins, the, heart, beats, at, a, resting, rate, close, to, 72, beats, per, minute, exercise, temporarily, increases, the, rate, but, lowers, it, in, the, long, term, and, is, good, for, heart, health, cardiovascular, diseases, are, the, most, common, cause, of, death, globally, as, of, 2008, accounting, for, 30, of, all, human, deaths, of, these, more, than, three, quarters, are, a, result, of, coronary, artery, disease, and, stroke, risk, factors, include, smoking, being, overweight, little, exercise, high, cholesterol, high, blood, pressure, and, poorly, controlled, diabetes, among, others, cardiovascular, diseases, do, not, frequently, have, symptoms, but, may, cause, chest, pain, or, shortness, of, breath, diagnosis, of, heart, disease, is, often, done, by, the, taking, of, a, medical, history, listening, to, the, heart, sounds, with, a, stethoscope, as, well, as, with, ecg, and, echocardiogram, which, uses, ultrasound, specialists, who, focus, on, diseases, of, the, heart, are, called, cardiologists, although, many, specialties, of, medicine, may, be, involved, in, treatment, the, human, heart, is, situated, in, the, mediastinum, at, the, level, of, thoracic, vertebrae, t5, t8, a, double, membraned, sac, called, the, pericardium, surrounds, the, heart, and, attaches, to, the, mediastinum, the, back, surface, of, the, heart, lies, near, the, vertebral, column, and, the, front, surface, known, as, the, sternocostal, surface, sits, behind, the, sternum, and, rib, cartilages, the, upper, part, of, the, heart, is, the, attachment, point, for, several, large, blood, vessels, the, venae, cavae, aorta, and, pulmonary, trunk, the, upper, part, of, the, heart, is, located, at, the, level, of, the, third, costal, cartilage, the, lower, tip, of, the, heart, the, apex, lies, to, the, left, of, the, sternum, 8, to, 9, cm, from, the, midsternal, line, between, the, junction, of, the, fourth, and, fifth, ribs, near, their, articulation, with, the, costal, cartilages, the, largest, part, of, the, heart, is, usually, slightly, offset, to, the, left, side, of, the, chest, though, occasionally, it, may, be, offset, to, the, right, and, is, felt, to, be, on, the, left, because, the, left, heart, is, stronger, and, larger, since, it, pumps, to, all, body, parts, because, the, heart, is, between, the, lungs, the, left, lung, is, smaller, than, the, right, lung, and, has, a, cardiac, notch, in, its, border, to, accommodate, the, heart, the, heart, is, cone, shaped, with, its, base, positioned, upwards, and, tapering, down, to, the, apex, an, adult, heart, has, a, mass, of, 250, 350, grams, 9, 12, oz, the, heart, is, often, described, as, the, size, of, a, fist, 12, cm, 5, in, in, length, 8, cm, 3, 5, in, wide, and, 6, cm, 2, 5, in, in, thickness, although, this, description, is, disputed, as, the, heart, is, likely, to, be, slightly, larger, well, trained, athletes, can, have, much, larger, hearts, due, to, the, effects, of, exercise, on, the, heart, muscle, similar, to, the, response, of, skeletal, muscle, the, heart, has, four, chambers, two, upper, atria, the, receiving, chambers, and, two, lower, ventricles, the, discharging, chambers, the, atria, open, into, the, ventricles, via, the, atrioventricular, valves, present, in, the, atrioventricular, septum, this, distinction, is, visible, also, on, the, surface, of, the, heart, as, the, coronary, sulcus, there, is, an, ear, shaped, structure, in, the, upper, right, atrium, called, the, right, atrial, appendage, or, auricle, and, another, in, the, upper, left, atrium, the, left, atrial, appendage, the, right, atrium, and, the, right, ventricle, together, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, right, heart, similarly, the, left, atrium, and, the, left, ventricle, together, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, left, heart, the, ventricles, are, separated, from, each, other, by, the, interventricular, septum, visible, on, the, surface, of, the, heart, as, the, anterior, longitudinal, sulcus, and, the, posterior, interventricular, sulcus, the, fibrous, cardiac, skeleton, gives, structure, to, the, heart, it, forms, the, atrioventricular, septum, which, separates, the, atria, from, the, ventricles, and, the, fibrous, rings, which, serve, as, bases, for, the, four, heart, valves, the, cardiac, skeleton, also, provides, an, important, boundary, in, the, heart, s, electrical, conduction, system, since, collagen, cannot, conduct, electricity, the, interatrial, septum, separates, the, atria, and, the, interventricular, septum, separates, the, ventricles, the, interventricular, septum, is, much, thicker, than, the, interatrial, septum, since, the, ventricles, need, to, generate, greater, pressure, when, they, contract, the, heart, has, four, valves, which, separate, its, chambers, one, valve, lies, between, each, atrium, and, ventricle, and, one, valve, rests, at, the, exit, of, each, ventricle, the, valves, between, the, atria, and, ventricles, are, called, the, atrioventricular, valves, between, the, right, atrium, and, the, right, ventricle, is, the, tricuspid, valve, the, tricuspid, valve, has, three, cusps, which, connect, to, chordae, tendinae, and, three, papillary, muscles, named, the, anterior, posterior, and, septal, muscles, after, their, relative, positions, the, mitral, valve, lies, between, the, left, atrium, and, left, ventricle, it, is, also, known, as, the, bicuspid, valve, due, to, its, having, two, cusps, an, anterior, and, a, posterior, cusp, these, cusps, are, also, attached, via, chordae, tendinae, to, two, papillary, muscles, projecting, from, the, ventricular, wall, the, papillary, muscles, extend, from, the, walls, of, the, heart, to, valves, by, cartilaginous, connections, called, chordae, tendinae, these, muscles, prevent, the, valves, from, falling, too, far, back, when, they, close, during, the, relaxation, phase, of, the, cardiac, cycle, the, papillary, muscles, are, also, relaxed, and, the, tension, on, the, chordae, tendineae, is, slight, as, the, heart, chambers, contract, so, do, the, papillary, muscles, this, creates, tension, on, the, chordae, tendineae, helping, to, hold, the, cusps, of, the, atrioventricular, valves, in, place, and, preventing, them, from, being, blown, back, into, the, atria, two, additional, semilunar, valves, sit, at, the, exit, of, each, of, the, ventricles, the, pulmonary, valve, is, located, at, the, base, of, the, pulmonary, artery, this, has, three, cusps, which, are, not, attached, to, any, papillary, muscles, when, the, ventricle, relaxes, blood, flows, back, into, the, ventricle, from, the, artery, and, this, flow, of, blood, fills, the, pocket, like, valve, pressing, against, the, cusps, which, close, to, seal, the, valve, the, semilunar, aortic, valve, is, at, the, base, of, the, aorta, and, also, is, not, attached, to, papillary, muscles, this, too, has, three, cusps, which, close, with, the, pressure, of, the, blood, flowing, back, from, the, aorta, the, right, heart, consists, of, two, chambers, the, right, atrium, and, the, right, ventricle, separated, by, a, valve, the, tricuspid, valve, the, right, atrium, receives, blood, almost, continuously, from, the, body, s, two, major, veins, the, superior, and, inferior, venae, cavae, a, small, amount, of, blood, from, the, coronary, circulation, also, drains, into, the, right, atrium, via, the, coronary, sinus, which, is, immediately, above, and, to, the, middle, of, the, opening, of, the, inferior, vena, cava, in, the, wall, of, the, right, atrium, is, an, oval, shaped, depression, known, as, the, fossa, ovalis, which, is, a, remnant, of, an, opening, in, the, fetal, heart, known, as, the, foramen, ovale, most, of, the, internal, surface, of, the, right, atrium, is, smooth, the, depression, of, the, fossa, ovalis, is, medial, and, the, anterior, surface, has, prominent, ridges, of, pectinate, muscles, which, are, also, present, in, the, right, atrial, appendage, the, right, atrium, is, connected, to, the, right, ventricle, by, the, tricuspid, valve, the, walls, of, the, right, ventricle, are, lined, with, trabeculae, carneae, ridges, of, cardiac, muscle, covered, by, endocardium, in, addition, to, these, muscular, ridges, a, band, of, cardiac, muscle, also, covered, by, endocardium, known, as, the, moderator, band, reinforces, the, thin, walls, of, the, right, ventricle, and, plays, a, crucial, role, in, cardiac, conduction, it, arises, from, the, lower, part, of, the, interventricular, septum, and, crosses, the, interior, space, of, the, right, ventricle, to, connect, with, the, inferior, papillary, muscle, the, right, ventricle, tapers, into, the, pulmonary, trunk, into, which, it, ejects, blood, when, contracting, the, pulmonary, trunk, branches, into, the, left, and, right, pulmonary, arteries, that, carry, the, blood, to, each, lung, the, pulmonary, valve, lies, between, the, right, heart, and, the, pulmonary, trunk, the, left, heart, has, two, chambers, the, left, atrium, and, the, left, ventricle, separated, by, the, mitral, valve, the, left, atrium, receives, oxygenated, blood, back, from, the, lungs, via, one, of, the, four, pulmonary, veins, the, left, atrium, has, an, outpouching, called, the, left, atrial, appendage, like, the, right, atrium, the, left, atrium, is, lined, by, pectinate, muscles, the, left, atrium, is, connected, to, the, left, ventricle, by, the, mitral, valve, the, left, ventricle, is, much, thicker, as, compared, with, the, right, due, to, the, greater, force, needed, to, pump, blood, to, the, entire, body, like, the, right, ventricle, the, left, also, has, trabeculae, carneae, but, there, is, no, moderator, band, the, left, ventricle, pumps, blood, to, the, body, through, the, aortic, valve, and, into, the, aorta, two, small, openings, above, the, aortic, valve, carry, blood, to, the, heart, muscle, the, left, coronary, artery, is, above, the, left, cusp, of, the, valve, and, the, right, coronary, artery, is, above, the, right, cusp, the, heart, wall, is, made, up, of, three, layers, the, inner, endocardium, middle, myocardium, and, outer, epicardium, these, are, surrounded, by, a, double, membraned, sac, called, the, pericardium, the, innermost, layer, of, the, heart, is, called, the, endocardium, it, is, made, up, of, a, lining, of, simple, squamous, epithelium, and, covers, heart, chambers, and, valves, it, is, continuous, with, the, endothelium, of, the, veins, and, arteries, of, the, heart, and, is, joined, to, the, myocardium, with, a, thin, layer, of, connective, tissue, the, endocardium, by, secreting, endothelins, may, also, play, a, role, in, regulating, the, contraction, of, the, myocardium, the, middle, layer, of, the, heart, wall, is, the, myocardium, which, is, the, cardiac, muscle, a, layer, of, involuntary, striated, muscle, tissue, surrounded, by, a, framework, of, collagen, the, cardiac, muscle, pattern, is, elegant, and, complex, as, the, muscle, cells, swirl, and, spiral, around, the, chambers, of, the, heart, with, the, outer, muscles, forming, a, figure, 8, pattern, around, the, atria, and, around, the, bases, of, the, great, vessels, and, the, inner, muscles, forming, a, figure, 8, around, the, two, ventricles, and, proceeding, toward, the, apex, this, complex, swirling, pattern, allows, the, heart, to, pump, blood, more, effectively, there, are, two, types, of, cells, in, cardiac, muscle, muscle, cells, which, have, the, ability, to, contract, easily, and, pacemaker, cells, of, the, conducting, system, the, muscle, cells, make, up, the, bulk, 99, of, cells, in, the, atria, and, ventricles, these, contractile, cells, are, connected, by, intercalated, discs, which, allow, a, rapid, response, to, impulses, of, action, potential, from, the, pacemaker, cells, the, intercalated, discs, allow, the, cells, to, act, as, a, syncytium, and, enable, the, contractions, that, pump, blood, through, the, heart, and, into, the, major, arteries, the, pacemaker, cells, make, up, 1, of, cells, and, form, the, conduction, system, of, the, heart, they, are, generally, much, smaller, than, the, contractile, cells, and, have, few, myofibrils, which, gives, them, limited, contractibility, their, function, is, similar, in, many, respects, to, neurons, cardiac, muscle, tissue, has, autorhythmicity, the, unique, ability, to, initiate, a, cardiac, action, potential, at, a, fixed, rate, spreading, the, impulse, rapidly, from, cell, to, cell, to, trigger, the, contraction, of, the, entire, heart, there, are, specific, proteins, expressed, in, cardiac, muscle, cells, these, are, mostly, associated, with, muscle, contraction, and, bind, with, actin, myosin, tropomyosin, and, troponin, they, include, myh6, actc1, tnni3, cdh2, and, pkp2, other, proteins, expressed, are, myh7, and, ldb3, that, are, also, expressed, in, skeletal, muscle, the, pericardium, is, the, sac, that, surrounds, the, heart, the, tough, outer, surface, of, the, pericardium, is, called, the, fibrous, membrane, this, is, lined, by, a, double, inner, membrane, called, the, serous, membrane, that, produces, pericardial, fluid, to, lubricate, the, surface, of, the, heart, the, part, of, the, serous, membrane, attached, to, the, fibrous, membrane, is, called, the, parietal, pericardium, while, the, part, of, the, serous, membrane, attached, to, the, heart, is, known, as, the, visceral, pericardium, the, pericardium, is, present, in, order, to, lubricate, its, movement, against, other, structures, within, the, chest, to, keep, the, heart, s, position, stabilised, within, the, chest, and, to, protect, the, heart, from, infection, heart, tissue, like, all, cells, in, the, body, needs, to, be, supplied, with, oxygen, nutrients, and, a, way, of, removing, metabolic, wastes, this, is, achieved, by, the, coronary, circulation, which, includes, arteries, veins, and, lymphatic, vessels, blood, flow, through, the, coronary, vessels, occurs, in, peaks, and, troughs, relating, to, the, heart, muscle, s, relaxation, or, contraction, heart, tissue, receives, blood, from, two, arteries, which, arise, just, above, the, aortic, valve, these, are, the, left, main, coronary, artery, and, the, right, coronary, artery, the, left, main, coronary, artery, splits, shortly, after, leaving, the, aorta, into, two, vessels, the, left, anterior, descending, and, the, left, circumflex, artery, the, left, anterior, descending, artery, supplies, heart, tissue, and, the, front, outer, side, and, septum, of, the, left, ventricle, it, does, this, by, branching, into, smaller, arteries, diagonal, and, septal, branches, the, left, circumflex, supplies, the, back, and, underneath, of, the, left, ventricle, the, right, coronary, artery, supplies, the, right, atrium, right, ventricle, and, lower, posterior, sections, of, the, left, ventricle, the, right, coronary, artery, also, supplies, blood, to, the, atrioventricular, node, in, about, 90, of, people, and, the, sinoatrial, node, in, about, 60, of, people, the, right, coronary, artery, runs, in, a, groove, at, the, back, of, the, heart, and, the, left, anterior, descending, artery, runs, in, a, groove, at, the, front, there, is, significant, variation, between, people, in, the, anatomy, of, the, arteries, that, supply, the, heart, the, arteries, divide, at, their, furthest, reaches, into, smaller, branches, that, join, at, the, edges, of, each, arterial, distribution, the, coronary, sinus, is, a, large, vein, that, drains, into, the, right, atrium, and, receives, most, of, the, venous, drainage, of, the, heart, it, receives, blood, from, the, great, cardiac, vein, receiving, the, left, atrium, and, both, ventricles, the, posterior, cardiac, vein, draining, the, back, of, the, left, ventricle, the, middle, cardiac, vein, draining, the, bottom, of, the, left, and, right, ventricles, and, small, cardiac, veins, the, anterior, cardiac, veins, drain, the, front, of, the, right, ventricle, and, drain, directly, into, the, right, atrium, small, lymphatic, networks, called, plexuses, exist, beneath, each, of, the, three, layers, of, the, heart, these, networks, collect, into, a, main, left, and, a, main, right, trunk, which, travel, up, the, groove, between, the, ventricles, that, exists, on, the, heart, s, surface, receiving, smaller, vessels, as, they, travel, up, these, vessels, then, travel, into, the, atrioventricular, groove, and, receive, a, third, vessel, which, drains, the, section, of, the, left, ventricle, sitting, on, the, diaphragm, the, left, vessel, joins, with, this, third, vessel, and, travels, along, the, pulmonary, artery, and, left, atrium, ending, in, the, inferior, tracheobronchial, node, the, right, vessel, travels, along, the, right, atrium, and, the, part, of, the, right, ventricle, sitting, on, the, diaphragm, it, usually, then, travels, in, front, of, the, ascending, aorta, and, then, ends, in, a, brachiocephalic, node, the, heart, receives, nerve, signals, from, the, vagus, nerve, and, from, nerves, arising, from, the, sympathetic, trunk, these, nerves, act, to, influence, but, not, control, the, heart, rate, sympathetic, nerves, also, influence, the, force, of, heart, contraction, signals, that, travel, along, these, nerves, arise, from, two, paired, cardiovascular, centres, in, the, medulla, oblongata, the, vagus, nerve, of, the, parasympathetic, nervous, system, acts, to, decrease, the, heart, rate, and, nerves, from, the, sympathetic, trunk, act, to, increase, the, heart, rate, these, nerves, form, a, network, of, nerves, that, lies, over, the, heart, called, the, cardiac, plexus, the, vagus, nerve, is, a, long, wandering, nerve, that, emerges, from, the, brainstem, and, provides, parasympathetic, stimulation, to, a, large, number, of, organs, in, the, thorax, and, abdomen, including, the, heart, the, nerves, from, the, sympathetic, trunk, emerge, through, the, t1, t4, thoracic, ganglia, and, travel, to, both, the, sinoatrial, and, atrioventricular, nodes, as, well, as, to, the, atria, and, ventricles, the, ventricles, are, more, richly, innervated, by, sympathetic, fibers, than, parasympathetic, fibers, sympathetic, stimulation, causes, the, release, of, the, neurotransmitter, norepinephrine, also, known, as, noradrenaline, at, the, neuromuscular, junction, of, the, cardiac, nerves, this, shortens, the, repolarisation, period, thus, speeding, the, rate, of, depolarisation, and, contraction, which, results, in, an, increased, heart, rate, it, opens, chemical, or, ligand, gated, sodium, and, calcium, ion, channels, allowing, an, influx, of, positively, charged, ions, norepinephrine, binds, to, the, beta, 1, receptor, the, heart, is, the, first, functional, organ, to, develop, and, starts, to, beat, and, pump, blood, at, about, three, weeks, into, embryogenesis, this, early, start, is, crucial, for, subsequent, embryonic, and, prenatal, development, the, heart, derives, from, splanchnopleuric, mesenchyme, in, the, neural, plate, which, forms, the, cardiogenic, region, two, endocardial, tubes, form, here, that, fuse, to, form, a, primitive, heart, tube, known, as, the, tubular, heart, between, the, third, and, fourth, week, the, heart, tube, lengthens, and, begins, to, fold, to, form, an, s, shape, within, the, pericardium, this, places, the, chambers, and, major, vessels, into, the, correct, alignment, for, the, developed, heart, further, development, will, include, the, formation, of, the, septa, and, the, valves, and, the, remodeling, of, the, heart, chambers, by, the, end, of, the, fifth, week, the, septa, are, complete, and, by, the, ninth, week, the, heart, valves, are, complete, before, the, fifth, week, there, is, an, opening, in, the, fetal, heart, known, as, the, foramen, ovale, the, foramen, ovale, allowed, blood, in, the, fetal, heart, to, pass, directly, from, the, right, atrium, to, the, left, atrium, allowing, some, blood, to, bypass, the, lungs, within, seconds, after, birth, a, flap, of, tissue, known, as, the, septum, primum, that, previously, acted, as, a, valve, closes, the, foramen, ovale, and, establishes, the, typical, cardiac, circulation, pattern, a, depression, in, the, surface, of, the, right, atrium, remains, where, the, foramen, ovale, was, called, the, fossa, ovalis, the, embryonic, heart, begins, beating, at, around, 22, days, after, conception, 5, weeks, after, the, last, normal, menstrual, period, lmp, it, starts, to, beat, at, a, rate, near, to, the, mother, s, which, is, about, 75, 80, beats, per, minute, bpm, the, embryonic, heart, rate, then, accelerates, and, reaches, a, peak, rate, of, 165, 185, bpm, early, in, the, early, 7th, week, early, 9th, week, after, the, lmp, after, 9, weeks, start, of, the, fetal, stage, it, starts, to, decelerate, slowing, to, around, 145, 25, bpm, at, birth, there, is, no, difference, in, female, and, male, heart, rates, before, birth, the, heart, functions, as, a, pump, in, the, circulatory, system, to, provide, a, continuous, flow, of, blood, throughout, the, body, this, circulation, consists, of, the, systemic, circulation, to, and, from, the, body, and, the, pulmonary, circulation, to, and, from, the, lungs, blood, in, the, pulmonary, circulation, exchanges, carbon, dioxide, for, oxygen, in, the, lungs, through, the, process, of, respiration, the, systemic, circulation, then, transports, oxygen, to, the, body, and, returns, carbon, dioxide, and, relatively, deoxygenated, blood, to, the, heart, for, transfer, to, the, lungs, the, right, heart, collects, deoxygenated, blood, from, two, large, veins, the, superior, and, inferior, venae, cavae, blood, collects, in, the, right, and, left, atrium, continuously, the, superior, vena, cava, drains, blood, from, above, the, diaphragm, and, empties, into, the, upper, back, part, of, the, right, atrium, the, inferior, vena, cava, drains, the, blood, from, below, the, diaphragm, and, empties, into, the, back, part, of, the, atrium, below, the, opening, for, the, superior, vena, cava, immediately, above, and, to, the, middle, of, the, opening, of, the, inferior, vena, cava, is, the, opening, of, the, thin, walled, coronary, sinus, additionally, the, coronary, sinus, returns, deoxygenated, blood, from, the, myocardium, to, the, right, atrium, the, blood, collects, in, the, right, atrium, when, the, right, atrium, contracts, the, blood, is, pumped, through, the, tricuspid, valve, into, the, right, ventricle, as, the, right, ventricle, contracts, the, tricuspid, valve, closes, and, the, blood, is, pumped, into, the, pulmonary, trunk, through, the, pulmonary, valve, the, pulmonary, trunk, divides, into, pulmonary, arteries, and, progressively, smaller, arteries, throughout, the, lungs, until, it, reaches, capillaries, as, these, pass, by, alveoli, carbon, dioxide, is, exchanged, for, oxygen, this, happens, through, the, passive, process, of, diffusion, in, the, left, heart, oxygenated, blood, is, returned, to, the, left, atrium, via, the, pulmonary, veins, it, is, then, pumped, into, the, left, ventricle, through, the, mitral, valve, and, into, the, aorta, through, the, aortic, valve, for, systemic, circulation, the, aorta, is, a, large, artery, that, branches, into, many, smaller, arteries, arterioles, and, ultimately, capillaries, in, the, capillaries, oxygen, and, nutrients, from, blood, are, supplied, to, body, cells, for, metabolism, and, exchanged, for, carbon, dioxide, and, waste, products, capillary, blood, now, deoxygenated, travels, into, venules, and, veins, that, ultimately, collect, in, the, superior, and, inferior, vena, cavae, and, into, the, right, heart, the, cardiac, cycle, is, the, sequence, of, events, in, which, the, heart, contracts, and, relaxes, with, every, heartbeat, the, period, of, time, during, which, the, ventricles, contract, forcing, blood, out, into, the, aorta, and, main, pulmonary, artery, is, known, as, systole, while, the, period, during, which, the, ventricles, relax, and, refill, with, blood, is, known, as, diastole, the, atria, and, ventricles, work, in, concert, so, in, systole, when, the, ventricles, are, contracting, the, atria, are, relaxed, and, collecting, blood, when, the, ventricles, are, relaxed, in, diastole, the, atria, contract, to, pump, blood, to, the, ventricles, this, coordination, ensures, blood, is, pumped, efficiently, to, the, body, at, the, beginning, of, the, cardiac, cycle, the, ventricles, are, relaxing, as, they, do, so, they, are, filled, by, blood, passing, through, the, open, mitral, and, tricuspid, valves, after, the, ventricles, have, completed, most, of, their, filling, the, atria, contract, forcing, further, blood, into, the, ventricles, and, priming, the, pump, next, the, ventricles, start, to, contract, as, the, pressure, rises, within, the, cavities, of, the, ventricles, the, mitral, and, tricuspid, valves, are, forced, shut, as, the, pressure, within, the, ventricles, rises, further, exceeding, the, pressure, with, the, aorta, and, pulmonary, arteries, the, aortic, and, pulmonary, valves, open, blood, is, ejected, from, the, heart, causing, the, pressure, within, the, ventricles, to, fall, simultaneously, the, atria, refill, as, blood, flows, into, the, right, atrium, through, the, superior, and, inferior, vena, cavae, and, into, the, left, atrium, through, the, pulmonary, veins, finally, when, the, pressure, within, the, ventricles, falls, below, the, pressure, within, the, aorta, and, pulmonary, arteries, the, aortic, and, pulmonary, valves, close, the, ventricles, start, to, relax, the, mitral, and, tricuspid, valves, open, and, the, cycle, begins, again, cardiac, output, co, is, a, measurement, of, the, amount, of, blood, pumped, by, each, ventricle, stroke, volume, in, one, minute, this, is, calculated, by, multiplying, the, stroke, volume, sv, by, the, beats, per, minute, of, the, heart, rate, hr, so, that, co, sv, x, hr, the, cardiac, output, is, normalized, to, body, size, through, body, surface, area, and, is, called, the, cardiac, index, the, average, cardiac, output, using, an, average, stroke, volume, of, about, 70ml, is, 5, 25, l, min, with, a, normal, range, of, 4, 0, 8, 0, l, min, the, stroke, volume, is, normally, measured, using, an, echocardiogram, and, can, be, influenced, by, the, size, of, the, heart, physical, and, mental, condition, of, the, individual, sex, contractility, duration, of, contraction, preload, and, afterload, preload, refers, to, the, filling, pressure, of, the, atria, at, the, end, of, diastole, when, the, ventricles, are, at, their, fullest, a, main, factor, is, how, long, it, takes, the, ventricles, to, fill, if, the, ventricles, contract, more, frequently, then, there, is, less, time, to, fill, and, the, preload, will, be, less, preload, can, also, be, affected, by, a, person, s, blood, volume, the, force, of, each, contraction, of, the, heart, muscle, is, proportional, to, the, preload, described, as, the, frank, starling, mechanism, this, states, that, the, force, of, contraction, is, directly, proportional, to, the, initial, length, of, muscle, fiber, meaning, a, ventricle, will, contract, more, forcefully, the, more, it, is, stretched, afterload, or, how, much, pressure, the, heart, must, generate, to, eject, blood, at, systole, is, influenced, by, vascular, resistance, it, can, be, influenced, by, narrowing, of, the, heart, valves, stenosis, or, contraction, or, relaxation, of, the, peripheral, blood, vessels, the, strength, of, heart, muscle, contractions, controls, the, stroke, volume, this, can, be, influenced, positively, or, negatively, by, agents, termed, inotropes, these, agents, can, be, a, result, of, changes, within, the, body, or, be, given, as, drugs, as, part, of, treatment, for, a, medical, disorder, or, as, a, form, of, life, support, particularly, in, intensive, care, units, inotropes, that, increase, the, force, of, contraction, are, positive, inotropes, and, include, sympathetic, agents, such, as, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and, dopamine, negative, inotropes, decrease, the, force, of, contraction, and, include, calcium, channel, blockers, the, normal, rhythmical, heart, beat, called, sinus, rhythm, is, established, by, the, heart, s, own, pacemaker, the, sinoatrial, node, also, known, as, the, sinus, node, or, the, sa, node, here, an, electrical, signal, is, created, that, travels, through, the, heart, causing, the, heart, muscle, to, contract, the, sinoatrial, node, is, found, in, the, upper, part, of, the, right, atrium, near, to, the, junction, with, the, superior, vena, cava, the, electrical, signal, generated, by, the, sinoatrial, node, travels, through, the, right, atrium, in, a, radial, way, that, is, not, completely, understood, it, travels, to, the, left, atrium, via, bachmann, s, bundle, such, that, the, muscles, of, the, left, and, right, atria, contract, together, the, signal, then, travels, to, the, atrioventricular, node, this, is, found, at, the, bottom, of, the, right, atrium, in, the, atrioventricular, septum, the, boundary, between, the, right, atrium, and, the, left, ventricle, the, septum, is, part, of, the, cardiac, skeleton, tissue, within, the, heart, that, the, electrical, signal, cannot, pass, through, which, forces, the, signal, to, pass, through, the, atrioventricular, node, only, the, signal, then, travels, along, the, bundle, of, his, to, left, and, right, bundle, branches, through, to, the, ventricles, of, the, heart, in, the, ventricles, the, signal, is, carried, by, specialized, tissue, called, the, purkinje, fibers, which, then, transmit, the, electric, charge, to, the, heart, muscle, the, normal, resting, heart, rate, is, called, the, sinus, rhythm, created, and, sustained, by, the, sinoatrial, node, a, group, of, pacemaking, cells, found, in, the, wall, of, the, right, atrium, cells, in, the, sinoatrial, node, do, this, by, creating, an, action, potential, the, cardiac, action, potential, is, created, by, the, movement, of, specific, electrolytes, into, and, out, of, the, pacemaker, cells, the, action, potential, then, spreads, to, nearby, cells, when, the, sinoatrial, cells, are, resting, they, have, a, negative, charge, on, their, membranes, a, rapid, influx, of, sodium, ions, causes, the, membrane, s, charge, to, become, positive, this, is, called, depolarisation, and, occurs, spontaneously, once, the, cell, has, a, sufficiently, high, charge, the, sodium, channels, close, and, calcium, ions, then, begin, to, enter, the, cell, shortly, after, which, potassium, begins, to, leave, it, all, the, ions, travel, through, ion, channels, in, the, membrane, of, the, sinoatrial, cells, the, potassium, and, calcium, start, to, move, out, of, and, into, the, cell, only, once, it, has, a, sufficiently, high, charge, and, so, are, called, voltage, gated, shortly, after, this, the, calcium, channels, close, and, potassium, channels, open, allowing, potassium, to, leave, the, cell, this, causes, the, cell, to, have, a, negative, resting, charge, and, is, called, repolarisation, when, the, membrane, potential, reaches, approximately, 60, mv, the, potassium, channels, close, and, the, process, may, begin, again, the, ions, move, from, areas, where, they, are, concentrated, to, where, they, are, not, for, this, reason, sodium, moves, into, the, cell, from, outside, and, potassium, moves, from, within, the, cell, to, outside, the, cell, calcium, also, plays, a, critical, role, their, influx, through, slow, channels, means, that, the, sinoatrial, cells, have, a, prolonged, plateau, phase, when, they, have, a, positive, charge, a, part, of, this, is, called, the, absolute, refractory, period, calcium, ions, also, combine, with, the, regulatory, protein, troponin, c, in, the, troponin, complex, to, enable, contraction, of, the, cardiac, muscle, and, separate, from, the, protein, to, allow, relaxation, the, adult, resting, heart, rate, ranges, from, 60, to, 100, bpm, the, resting, heart, rate, of, a, newborn, can, be, 129, beats, per, minute, bpm, and, this, gradually, decreases, until, maturity, an, athlete, s, heart, rate, can, be, lower, than, 60, bpm, during, exercise, the, rate, can, be, 150, bpm, with, maximum, rates, reaching, from, 200, to, 220, bpm, the, normal, sinus, rhythm, of, the, heart, giving, the, resting, heart, rate, is, influenced, by, a, number, of, factors, the, cardiovascular, centres, in, the, brainstem, control, the, sympathetic, and, parasympathetic, influences, to, the, heart, through, the, vagus, nerve, and, sympathetic, trunk, these, cardiovascular, centres, receive, input, from, a, series, of, receptors, including, baroreceptors, sensing, the, stretching, of, blood, vessels, and, chemoreceptors, sensing, the, amount, of, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, in, the, blood, and, its, ph, through, a, series, of, reflexes, these, help, regulate, and, sustain, blood, flow, baroreceptors, are, stretch, receptors, located, in, the, aortic, sinus, carotid, bodies, the, venae, cavae, and, other, locations, including, pulmonary, vessels, and, the, right, side, of, the, heart, itself, baroreceptors, fire, at, a, rate, determined, by, how, much, they, are, stretched, which, is, influenced, by, blood, pressure, level, of, physical, activity, and, the, relative, distribution, of, blood, with, increased, pressure, and, stretch, the, rate, of, baroreceptor, firing, increases, and, the, cardiac, centers, decrease, sympathetic, stimulation, and, increase, parasympathetic, stimulation, as, pressure, and, stretch, decrease, the, rate, of, baroreceptor, firing, decreases, and, the, cardiac, centers, increase, sympathetic, stimulation, and, decrease, parasympathetic, stimulation, there, is, a, similar, reflex, called, the, atrial, reflex, or, bainbridge, reflex, associated, with, varying, rates, of, blood, flow, to, the, atria, increased, venous, return, stretches, the, walls, of, the, atria, where, specialized, baroreceptors, are, located, however, as, the, atrial, baroreceptors, increase, their, rate, of, firing, and, as, they, stretch, due, to, the, increased, blood, pressure, the, cardiac, center, responds, by, increasing, sympathetic, stimulation, and, inhibiting, parasympathetic, stimulation, to, increase, heart, rate, the, opposite, is, also, true, chemoreceptors, present, in, the, carotid, body, or, adjacent, to, the, aorta, in, an, aortic, body, respond, to, the, blood, s, oxygen, carbon, dioxide, levels, low, oxygen, or, high, carbon, dioxide, will, stimulate, firing, of, the, receptors, exercise, and, fitness, levels, age, body, temperature, basal, metabolic, rate, and, even, a, person, s, emotional, state, can, all, affect, the, heart, rate, high, levels, of, the, hormones, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and, thyroid, hormones, can, increase, the, heart, rate, the, levels, of, electrolytes, including, calcium, potassium, and, sodium, can, also, influence, the, speed, and, regularity, of, the, heart, rate, low, blood, oxygen, low, blood, pressure, and, dehydration, may, increase, it, cardiovascular, diseases, which, include, diseases, of, the, heart, are, the, leading, cause, of, death, worldwide, the, majority, of, cardiovascular, disease, is, noncommunicable, and, related, to, lifestyle, and, other, factors, becoming, more, prevalent, with, ageing, heart, disease, is, a, major, cause, of, death, accounting, for, an, average, of, 30, of, all, deaths, in, 2008, globally, this, rate, varies, from, a, lower, 28, to, a, high, 40, in, high, income, countries, doctors, that, specialise, in, the, heart, are, called, cardiologists, many, other, medical, professionals, are, involved, in, treating, diseases, of, the, heart, including, doctors, cardiothoracic, surgeons, intensivists, and, allied, health, practitioners, including, physiotherapists, and, dieticians, coronary, artery, disease, also, known, as, ischemic, heart, disease, is, caused, by, atherosclerosis, a, build, up, of, fatty, material, along, the, inner, walls, of, the, arteries, these, fatty, deposits, known, as, atherosclerotic, plaques, narrow, the, coronary, arteries, and, if, severe, may, reduce, blood, flow, to, the, heart, if, a, narrowing, or, stenosis, is, relatively, minor, then, the, patient, may, not, experience, any, symptoms, severe, narrowings, may, cause, chest, pain, angina, or, breathlessness, during, exercise, or, even, at, rest, the, thin, covering, of, an, atherosclerotic, plaque, can, rupture, exposing, the, fatty, centre, to, the, circulating, blood, in, this, case, a, clot, or, thrombus, can, form, blocking, the, artery, and, restricting, blood, flow, to, an, area, of, heart, muscle, causing, a, myocardial, infarction, a, heart, attack, or, unstable, angina, in, the, worst, case, this, may, cause, cardiac, arrest, a, sudden, and, utter, loss, of, output, from, the, heart, obesity, high, blood, pressure, uncontrolled, diabetes, smoking, and, high, cholesterol, can, all, increase, the, risk, of, developing, atherosclerosis, and, coronary, artery, disease, heart, failure, is, defined, as, a, condition, in, which, the, heart, is, unable, to, pump, enough, blood, to, meet, the, demands, of, the, body, patients, with, heart, failure, may, experience, breathlessness, especially, when, lying, flat, as, well, as, ankle, swelling, known, as, peripheral, oedema, heart, failure, is, the, result, of, many, diseases, affecting, the, heart, but, is, most, commonly, associated, with, ischemic, heart, disease, valvular, heart, disease, or, high, blood, pressure, less, common, causes, include, various, cardiomyopathies, heart, failure, is, frequently, associated, with, weakness, of, the, heart, muscle, in, the, ventricles, systolic, heart, failure, but, can, also, be, seen, in, patients, with, heart, muscle, that, is, strong, but, stiff, diastolic, heart, failure, the, condition, may, affect, the, left, ventricle, causing, predominantly, breathlessness, the, right, ventricle, causing, predominantly, swelling, of, the, legs, and, an, elevated, jugular, venous, pressure, or, both, ventricles, patients, with, heart, failure, are, at, higher, risk, of, developing, dangerous, heart, rhythm, disturbances, or, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, are, diseases, affecting, the, muscle, of, the, heart, some, cause, abnormal, thickening, of, the, heart, muscle, hypertrophic, cardiomyopathy, some, cause, the, heart, to, abnormally, expand, and, weaken, dilated, cardiomyopathy, some, cause, the, heart, muscle, to, become, stiff, and, unable, to, fully, relax, between, contractions, restrictive, cardiomyopathy, and, some, make, the, heart, prone, to, abnormal, heart, rhythms, arrhythmogenic, cardiomyopathy, these, conditions, are, often, genetic, and, can, be, inherited, but, some, such, as, dilated, cardiomyopathy, may, be, caused, by, damage, from, toxins, such, as, alcohol, some, cardiomyopathies, such, as, hypertrophic, cardiomopathy, are, linked, to, a, higher, risk, of, sudden, cardiac, death, particularly, in, athletes, many, cardiomyopathies, can, lead, to, heart, failure, in, the, later, stages, of, the, disease, healthy, heart, valves, allow, blood, to, flow, easily, in, one, direction, and, prevent, it, from, flowing, in, the, other, direction, a, diseased, heart, valve, may, have, a, narrow, opening, stenosis, that, restricts, the, flow, of, blood, in, the, forward, direction, a, valve, may, otherwise, be, leaky, allowing, blood, to, leak, in, the, reverse, direction, regurgitation, valvular, heart, disease, may, cause, breathlessness, blackouts, or, chest, pain, but, may, be, asymptomatic, and, only, detected, on, a, routine, examination, by, hearing, abnormal, heart, sounds, or, a, heart, murmur, in, the, developed, world, valvular, heart, disease, is, most, commonly, caused, by, degeneration, secondary, to, old, age, but, may, also, be, caused, by, infection, of, the, heart, valves, endocarditis, in, some, parts, of, the, world, rheumatic, heart, disease, is, a, major, cause, of, valvular, heart, disease, typically, leading, to, mitral, or, aortic, stenosis, and, caused, by, the, body, s, immune, system, reacting, to, a, streptococcal, throat, infection, while, in, the, healthy, heart, waves, of, electrical, impulses, originate, in, the, sinus, node, before, spreading, to, the, rest, of, the, atria, the, atrioventricular, node, and, finally, the, ventricles, referred, to, as, a, normal, sinus, rhythm, this, normal, rhythm, can, be, disrupted, abnormal, heart, rhythms, or, arrhythmias, may, be, asymptomatic, or, may, cause, palpitations, blackouts, or, breathlessness, some, types, of, arrhythmia, such, as, atrial, fibrillation, increase, the, long, term, risk, of, stroke, some, arrhythmias, cause, the, heart, to, beat, abnormally, slowly, referred, to, as, a, bradycardia, or, bradyarrhythmia, this, may, be, caused, by, an, abnormally, slow, sinus, node, or, damage, within, the, cardiac, conduction, system, heart, block, in, other, arrhythmias, the, heart, may, beat, abnormally, rapidly, referred, to, as, a, tachycardia, or, tachyarrhythmia, these, arrhythmias, can, take, many, forms, and, can, originate, from, different, structures, within, the, heart, some, arise, from, the, atria, e, g, atrial, flutter, some, from, the, atrioventricular, node, e, g, av, nodal, re, entrant, tachycardia, whilst, others, arise, from, the, ventricles, e, g, ventricular, tachycardia, some, tachyarrhythmias, are, caused, by, scarring, within, the, heart, e, g, some, forms, of, ventricular, tachycardia, others, by, an, irritable, focus, e, g, focal, atrial, tachycardia, while, others, are, caused, by, additional, abnormal, conduction, tissue, that, has, been, present, since, birth, e, g, wolff, parkinson, white, syndrome, the, most, dangerous, form, of, heart, racing, is, ventricular, fibrillation, in, which, the, ventricles, quiver, rather, than, contract, and, which, if, untreated, is, rapidly, fatal, the, sac, which, surrounds, the, heart, called, the, pericardium, can, become, inflamed, in, a, condition, known, as, pericarditis, this, condition, typically, causes, chest, pain, that, may, spread, to, the, back, and, is, often, caused, by, a, viral, infection, glandular, fever, cytomegalovirus, or, coxsackievirus, fluid, can, build, up, within, the, pericardial, sac, referred, to, as, a, pericardial, effusion, pericardial, effusions, often, occur, secondary, to, pericarditis, kidney, failure, or, tumours, and, frequently, do, not, cause, any, symptoms, however, large, effusions, or, effusions, which, accumulate, rapidly, can, compress, the, heart, in, a, condition, known, as, cardiac, tamponade, causing, breathlessness, and, potentially, fatal, low, blood, pressure, fluid, can, be, removed, from, the, pericardial, space, for, diagnosis, or, to, relieve, tamponade, using, a, syringe, in, a, procedure, called, pericardiocentesis, some, people, are, born, with, hearts, that, are, abnormal, and, these, abnormalities, are, known, as, congenital, heart, defects, they, may, range, from, the, relatively, minor, e, g, patent, foramen, ovale, arguably, a, variant, of, normal, to, serious, life, threatening, abnormalities, e, g, hypoplastic, left, heart, syndrome, common, abnormalities, include, those, that, affect, the, heart, muscle, that, separates, the, two, side, of, the, heart, a, hole, in, the, heart, e, g, ventricular, septal, defect, other, defects, include, those, affecting, the, heart, valves, e, g, congenital, aortic, stenosis, or, the, main, blood, vessels, that, lead, from, the, heart, e, g, coarctation, of, the, aorta, more, complex, syndromes, are, seen, that, affect, more, than, one, part, of, the, heart, e, g, tetralogy, of, fallot, some, congenital, heart, defects, allow, blood, that, is, low, in, oxygen, that, would, normally, be, returned, to, the, lungs, to, instead, be, pumped, back, to, the, rest, of, the, body, these, are, known, as, cyanotic, congenital, heart, defects, and, are, often, more, serious, major, congenital, heart, defects, are, often, picked, up, in, childhood, shortly, after, birth, or, even, before, a, child, is, born, e, g, transposition, of, the, great, arteries, causing, breathlessness, and, a, lower, rate, of, growth, more, minor, forms, of, congenital, heart, disease, may, remain, undetected, for, many, years, and, only, reveal, themselves, in, adult, life, e, g, atrial, septal, defect, channelopathies, can, be, categorized, based, on, the, organ, system, they, affect, in, the, cardiovascular, system, the, electrical, impulse, required, for, each, heart, beat, is, provided, by, the, electrochemical, gradient, of, each, heart, cell, because, the, beating, of, the, heart, depends, on, the, proper, movement, of, ions, across, the, surface, membrane, cardiac, ion, channelopathies, form, a, major, group, of, heart, diseases, cardiac, ion, channelopathies, may, explain, some, of, the, cases, of, sudden, death, syndrome, and, sudden, arrhythmic, death, syndrome, long, qt, syndrome, is, the, most, common, form, of, cardiac, channelopathy, heart, disease, is, diagnosed, by, the, taking, of, a, medical, history, a, cardiac, examination, and, further, investigations, including, blood, tests, echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and, imaging, other, invasive, procedures, such, as, cardiac, catheterisation, can, also, play, a, role, the, cardiac, examination, includes, inspection, feeling, the, chest, with, the, hands, palpation, and, listening, with, a, stethoscope, auscultation, it, involves, assessment, of, signs, that, may, be, visible, on, a, person, s, hands, such, as, splinter, haemorrhages, joints, and, other, areas, a, person, s, pulse, is, taken, usually, at, the, radial, artery, near, the, wrist, in, order, to, assess, for, the, rhythm, and, strength, of, the, pulse, the, blood, pressure, is, taken, using, either, a, manual, or, automatic, sphygmomanometer, or, using, a, more, invasive, measurement, from, within, the, artery, any, elevation, of, the, jugular, venous, pulse, is, noted, a, person, s, chest, is, felt, for, any, transmitted, vibrations, from, the, heart, and, then, listened, to, with, a, stethoscope, typically, healthy, hearts, have, only, two, audible, heart, sounds, called, s1, and, s2, the, first, heart, sound, s1, is, the, sound, created, by, the, closing, of, the, atrioventricular, valves, during, ventricular, contraction, and, is, normally, described, as, lub, the, second, heart, sound, s2, is, the, sound, of, the, semilunar, valves, closing, during, ventricular, diastole, and, is, described, as, dub, each, sound, consists, of, two, components, reflecting, the, slight, difference, in, time, as, the, two, valves, close, s2, may, split, into, two, distinct, sounds, either, as, a, result, of, inspiration, or, different, valvular, or, cardiac, problems, additional, heart, sounds, may, also, be, present, and, these, give, rise, to, gallop, rhythms, a, third, heart, sound, s3, usually, indicates, an, increase, in, ventricular, blood, volume, a, fourth, heart, sound, s4, is, referred, to, as, an, atrial, gallop, and, is, produced, by, the, sound, of, blood, being, forced, into, a, stiff, ventricle, the, combined, presence, of, s3, and, s4, give, a, quadruple, gallop, heart, murmurs, are, abnormal, heart, sounds, which, can, be, either, related, to, disease, or, benign, and, there, are, several, kinds, there, are, normally, two, heart, sounds, and, abnormal, heart, sounds, can, either, be, extra, sounds, or, murmurs, related, to, the, flow, of, blood, between, the, sounds, murmurs, are, graded, by, volume, from, 1, the, quietest, to, 6, the, loudest, and, evaluated, by, their, relationship, to, the, heart, sounds, position, in, the, cardiac, cycle, and, additional, features, such, as, their, radiation, to, other, sites, changes, with, a, person, s, position, the, frequency, of, the, sound, as, determined, by, the, side, of, the, stethoscope, by, which, they, are, heard, and, site, at, which, they, are, heard, loudest, murmurs, may, be, caused, by, damaged, heart, valves, or, congenital, heart, disease, such, as, ventricular, septal, defects, or, may, be, heard, in, normal, hearts, a, different, type, of, sound, a, pericardial, friction, rub, can, be, heard, in, cases, of, pericarditis, where, the, inflamed, membranes, can, rub, together, blood, tests, play, an, important, role, in, the, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, many, cardiovascular, conditions, troponin, is, a, sensitive, biomarker, for, a, heart, with, insufficient, blood, supply, it, is, released, 4, 6, hours, after, injury, and, usually, peaks, at, about, 12, 24, hours, two, tests, of, troponin, are, often, taken, one, at, the, time, of, initial, presentation, and, another, within, 3, 6, hours, with, either, a, high, level, or, a, significant, rise, being, diagnostic, a, test, for, brain, natriuretic, peptide, bnp, can, be, used, to, evaluate, for, the, presence, of, heart, failure, and, rises, when, there, is, increased, demand, on, the, left, ventricle, these, tests, are, considered, biomarkers, because, they, are, highly, specific, for, cardiac, disease, testing, for, the, mb, form, of, creatine, kinase, provides, information, about, the, heart, s, blood, supply, but, is, used, less, frequently, because, it, is, less, specific, and, sensitive, other, blood, tests, are, often, taken, to, help, understand, a, person, s, general, health, and, risk, factors, that, may, contribute, to, heart, disease, these, often, include, a, full, blood, count, investigating, for, anaemia, and, basic, metabolic, panel, that, may, reveal, any, disturbances, in, electrolytes, a, coagulation, screen, is, often, required, to, ensure, that, the, right, level, of, anticoagulation, is, given, fasting, lipids, and, fasting, blood, glucose, or, an, hba1c, level, are, often, ordered, to, evaluate, a, person, s, cholesterol, and, diabetes, status, respectively, using, surface, electrodes, on, the, body, it, is, possible, to, record, the, electrical, activity, of, the, heart, this, tracing, of, the, electrical, signal, is, the, electrocardiogram, ecg, or, ekg, an, ecg, is, a, bedside, test, and, involves, the, placement, of, ten, leads, on, the, body, this, produces, a, 12, lead, ecg, three, extra, leads, are, calculated, mathematically, and, one, lead, is, electrically, ground, or, earthed, there, are, five, prominent, features, on, the, ecg, the, p, wave, atrial, depolarisation, the, qrs, complex, ventricular, depolarisation, and, the, t, wave, ventricular, repolarisation, as, the, heart, cells, contract, they, create, a, current, that, travels, through, the, heart, a, downward, deflection, on, the, ecg, implies, cells, are, becoming, more, positive, in, charge, depolarising, in, the, direction, of, that, lead, whereas, an, upward, inflection, implies, cells, are, becoming, more, negative, repolarising, in, the, direction, of, the, lead, this, depends, on, the, position, of, the, lead, so, if, a, wave, of, depolarising, moved, from, left, to, right, a, lead, on, the, left, would, show, a, negative, deflection, and, a, lead, on, the, right, would, show, a, positive, deflection, the, ecg, is, a, useful, tool, in, detecting, rhythm, disturbances, and, in, detecting, insufficient, blood, supply, to, the, heart, sometimes, abnormalities, are, suspected, but, not, immediately, visible, on, the, ecg, testing, when, exercising, can, be, used, to, provoke, an, abnormality, or, an, ecg, can, be, worn, for, a, longer, period, such, as, a, 24, hour, holter, monitor, if, a, suspected, rhythm, abnormality, is, not, present, at, the, time, of, assessment, several, imaging, methods, can, be, used, to, assess, the, anatomy, and, function, of, the, heart, including, ultrasound, echocardiography, angiography, ct, mri, and, pet, scans, an, echocardiogram, is, an, ultrasound, of, the, heart, used, to, measure, the, heart, s, function, assess, for, valve, disease, and, look, for, any, abnormalities, echocardiography, can, be, conducted, by, a, probe, on, the, chest, transthoracic, or, by, a, probe, in, the, esophagus, transesophageal, a, typical, echocardiography, report, will, include, information, about, the, width, of, the, valves, noting, any, stenosis, whether, there, is, any, backflow, of, blood, regurgitation, and, information, about, the, blood, volumes, at, the, end, of, systole, and, diastole, including, an, ejection, fraction, which, describes, how, much, blood, is, ejected, from, the, left, and, right, ventricles, after, systole, ejection, fraction, can, then, be, obtained, by, dividing, the, volume, ejected, by, the, heart, stroke, volume, by, the, volume, of, the, filled, heart, end, diastolic, volume, echocardiograms, can, also, be, conducted, under, circumstances, when, the, body, is, more, stressed, in, order, to, examine, for, signs, of, lack, of, blood, supply, this, cardiac, stress, test, involves, either, direct, exercise, or, where, this, is, not, possible, injection, of, a, drug, such, as, dobutamine, ct, scans, chest, x, rays, and, other, forms, of, imaging, can, help, evaluate, the, heart, s, size, evaluate, for, signs, of, pulmonary, oedema, and, indicate, whether, there, is, fluid, around, the, heart, they, are, also, useful, for, evaluating, the, aorta, the, major, blood, vessel, which, leaves, the, heart, diseases, affecting, the, heart, can, be, treated, by, a, variety, of, methods, including, lifestyle, modification, drug, treatment, and, surgery, narrowings, of, the, coronary, arteries, ischemic, heart, disease, are, treated, to, relieve, symptoms, of, chest, pain, caused, by, a, partially, narrowed, artery, angina, pectoris, to, minimise, heart, muscle, damage, when, an, artery, is, completely, occluded, myocardial, infarction, or, to, prevent, a, myocardial, infarction, from, occurring, medications, to, improve, angina, symptoms, include, nitroglycerin, beta, blockers, and, calcium, channel, blockers, while, preventative, treatments, include, antiplatelets, such, as, aspirin, and, statins, lifestyle, measures, such, as, stopping, smoking, and, weight, loss, and, treatment, of, risk, factors, such, as, high, blood, pressure, and, diabetes, in, addition, to, using, medications, narrowed, heart, arteries, can, be, treated, by, expanding, the, narrowings, or, redirecting, the, flow, of, blood, to, bypass, an, obstruction, this, may, be, performed, using, a, percutaneous, coronary, intervention, during, which, narrowings, can, be, expanded, by, passing, small, balloon, tipped, wires, into, the, coronary, arteries, inflating, the, balloon, to, expand, the, narrowing, and, sometimes, leaving, behind, a, metal, scaffold, known, as, a, stent, to, keep, the, artery, open, if, the, narrowings, in, coronary, arteries, are, unsuitable, for, treatment, with, a, percutaneous, coronary, intervention, open, surgery, may, be, required, a, coronary, artery, bypass, graft, can, be, performed, whereby, a, blood, vessel, from, another, part, of, the, body, the, saphenous, vein, radial, artery, or, internal, mammary, artery, is, used, to, redirect, blood, from, a, point, before, the, narrowing, typically, the, aorta, to, a, point, beyond, the, obstruction, diseased, heart, valves, that, have, become, abnormally, narrow, or, abnormally, leaky, may, require, surgery, this, is, traditionally, performed, as, an, open, surgical, procedure, to, replace, the, damaged, heart, valve, with, a, tissue, or, metallic, prosthetic, valve, in, some, circumstances, the, tricuspid, or, mitral, valves, can, be, repaired, surgically, avoiding, the, need, for, a, valve, replacement, heart, valves, can, also, be, treated, percutaneously, using, techniques, that, share, many, similarities, with, percutaneous, coronary, intervention, transcatheter, aortic, valve, replacement, is, increasingly, used, for, patients, consider, very, high, risk, for, open, valve, replacement, abnormal, heart, rhythms, arrhythmias, can, be, treated, using, antiarrhythmic, drugs, these, may, work, by, manipulating, the, flow, of, electrolytes, across, the, cell, membrane, such, as, calcium, channel, blockers, sodium, channel, blockers, amiodarone, or, digoxin, or, modify, the, autonomic, nervous, system, s, effect, on, the, heart, beta, blockers, and, atropine, in, some, arrhythmias, such, as, atrial, fibrillation, which, increase, the, risk, of, stroke, this, risk, can, be, reduced, using, anticoagulants, such, as, warfarin, or, novel, oral, anticoagulants, if, medications, fail, to, control, an, arrhythmia, another, treatment, option, may, be, catheter, ablation, in, these, procedures, wires, are, passed, from, a, vein, or, artery, in, the, leg, to, the, heart, to, find, the, abnormal, area, of, tissue, that, is, causing, the, arrhythmia, the, abnormal, tissue, can, be, intentionally, damaged, or, ablated, by, heating, or, freezing, to, prevent, further, heart, rhythm, disturbances, whilst, the, majority, of, arrhythmias, can, be, treated, using, minimally, invasive, catheter, techniques, some, arrhythmias, particularly, atrial, fibrillation, can, also, be, treated, using, open, or, thoracoscopic, surgery, either, at, the, time, of, other, cardiac, surgery, or, as, a, standalone, procedure, a, cardioversion, whereby, an, electric, shock, is, used, to, stun, the, heart, out, of, an, abnormal, rhythm, may, also, be, used, cardiac, devices, in, the, form, of, pacemakers, or, implantable, defibrillators, may, also, be, required, to, treat, arrhythmias, pacemakers, comprising, a, small, battery, powered, generator, implanted, under, the, skin, and, one, or, more, leads, that, extend, to, the, heart, are, most, commonly, used, to, treat, abnormally, slow, heart, rhythms, implantable, defibrillators, are, used, to, treat, serious, life, threatening, rapid, heart, rhythms, these, devices, monitor, the, heart, and, if, dangerous, heart, racing, is, detected, can, automatically, deliver, a, shock, to, restore, the, heart, to, a, normal, rhythm, implantable, defibrillators, are, most, commonly, used, in, patients, with, heart, failure, cardiomyopathies, or, inherited, arrhythmia, syndromes, as, well, as, addressing, the, underlying, cause, for, a, patient, s, heart, failure, most, commonly, ischemic, heart, disease, or, hypertension, the, mainstay, of, heart, failure, treatment, is, with, medication, these, include, drugs, to, prevent, fluid, from, accumulating, in, the, lungs, by, increasing, the, amount, of, urine, a, patient, produces, diuretics, and, drugs, that, attempt, to, preserve, the, pumping, function, of, the, heart, beta, blockers, ace, inhibitors, and, mineralocorticoid, receptor, antagonists, in, some, patients, with, heart, failure, a, specialised, pacemaker, known, as, cardiac, resynchronisation, therapy, can, be, used, to, improve, the, heart, s, pumping, efficiency, these, devices, are, frequently, combined, with, a, defibrillator, in, very, severe, cases, of, heart, failure, a, small, pump, called, a, ventricular, assist, device, may, be, implanted, which, supplements, the, heart, s, own, pumping, ability, in, the, most, severe, cases, a, cardiac, transplant, may, be, considered, humans, have, known, about, the, heart, since, ancient, times, although, its, precise, function, and, anatomy, were, not, clearly, understood, from, the, primarily, religious, views, of, earlier, societies, towards, the, heart, ancient, greeks, are, considered, to, have, been, the, primary, seat, of, scientific, understanding, of, the, heart, in, the, ancient, world, aristotle, considered, the, heart, to, be, the, organ, responsible, for, creating, blood, plato, considered, the, heart, as, the, source, of, circulating, blood, and, hippocrates, noted, blood, circulating, cyclically, from, the, body, through, the, heart, to, the, lungs, erasistratos, 304, 250, bce, noted, the, heart, as, a, pump, causing, dilation, of, blood, vessels, and, noted, that, arteries, and, veins, both, radiate, from, the, heart, becoming, progressively, smaller, with, distance, although, he, believed, they, were, filled, with, air, and, not, blood, he, also, discovered, the, heart, valves, the, greek, physician, galen, 2nd, century, ce, knew, blood, vessels, carried, blood, and, identified, venous, dark, red, and, arterial, brighter, and, thinner, blood, each, with, distinct, and, separate, functions, galen, noting, the, heart, as, the, hottest, organ, in, the, body, concluded, that, it, provided, heat, to, the, body, the, heart, did, not, pump, blood, around, the, heart, s, motion, sucked, blood, in, during, diastole, and, the, blood, moved, by, the, pulsation, of, the, arteries, themselves, galen, believed, the, arterial, blood, was, created, by, venous, blood, passing, from, the, left, ventricle, to, the, right, through, pores, between, the, ventricles, air, from, the, lungs, passed, from, the, lungs, via, the, pulmonary, artery, to, the, left, side, of, the, heart, and, created, arterial, blood, these, ideas, went, unchallenged, for, almost, a, thousand, years, the, earliest, descriptions, of, the, coronary, and, pulmonary, circulation, systems, can, be, found, in, the, commentary, on, anatomy, in, avicenna, s, canon, published, in, 1242, by, ibn, al, nafis, in, his, manuscript, al, nafis, wrote, that, blood, passes, through, the, pulmonary, circulation, instead, of, moving, from, the, right, to, the, left, ventricle, as, previously, believed, by, galen, his, work, was, later, translated, into, latin, by, andrea, alpago, in, europe, the, teachings, of, galen, continued, to, dominate, the, academic, community, and, his, doctrines, were, adopted, as, the, official, canon, of, the, church, andreas, vesalius, questioned, some, of, galen, s, beliefs, of, the, heart, in, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, 1543, but, his, magnum, opus, was, interpreted, as, a, challenge, to, the, authorities, and, he, was, subjected, to, a, number, of, attacks, michael, servetus, wrote, in, christianismi, restitutio, 1553, that, blood, flows, from, one, side, of, the, heart, to, the, other, via, the, lungs, a, breakthrough, in, understanding, the, flow, of, blood, through, the, heart, and, body, came, with, the, publication, of, de, motu, cordis, 1628, by, the, english, physician, william, harvey, harvey, s, book, completely, describes, the, systemic, circulation, and, the, mechanical, force, of, the, heart, leading, to, an, overhaul, of, the, galenic, doctrines, otto, frank, 1865, 1944, was, a, german, physiologist, among, his, many, published, works, are, detailed, studies, of, this, important, heart, relationship, ernest, starling, 1866, 1927, was, an, important, english, physiologist, who, also, studied, the, heart, although, they, worked, largely, independently, their, combined, efforts, and, similar, conclusions, have, been, recognized, in, the, name, frank, starling, mechanism, although, purkinje, fibers, and, the, bundle, of, his, were, discovered, as, early, as, the, 19th, century, their, specific, role, in, the, electrical, conduction, system, of, the, heart, remained, unknown, until, sunao, tawara, published, his, monograph, titled, das, reizleitungssystem, des, s, ugetierherzens, in, 1906, tawara, s, discovery, of, the, atrioventricular, node, prompted, arthur, keith, and, martin, flack, to, look, for, similar, structures, in, the, heart, leading, to, their, discovery, of, the, sinoatrial, node, several, months, later, these, structures, form, the, anatomical, basis, of, the, electrocardiogram, whose, inventor, willem, einthoven, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, medicine, or, physiology, in, 1924, the, first, heart, transplant, in, a, human, ever, performed, was, by, james, hardy, in, 1964, using, a, chimpanzee, heart, but, the, patient, died, within, 2, hours, the, first, human, to, human, heart, transplantation, was, performed, in, 1967, by, the, south, african, surgeon, christiaan, barnard, at, groote, schuur, hospital, in, cape, town, this, marked, an, important, milestone, in, cardiac, surgery, capturing, the, attention, of, both, the, medical, profession, and, the, world, at, large, however, long, term, survival, rates, of, patients, were, initially, very, low, louis, washkansky, the, first, recipient, of, a, donated, heart, died, 18, days, after, the, operation, while, other, patients, did, not, survive, for, more, than, a, few, weeks, the, american, surgeon, norman, shumway, has, been, credited, for, his, efforts, to, improve, transplantation, techniques, along, with, pioneers, richard, lower, vladimir, demikhov, and, adrian, kantrowitz, as, of, march, 2000, more, than, 55, 000, heart, transplantations, have, been, performed, worldwide, the, first, successful, transplant, of, a, heart, from, a, genetically, modified, pig, to, a, human, in, which, the, patient, lived, for, a, longer, time, was, performed, january, 7, 2022, in, baltimore, by, heart, surgeon, bartley, p, griffith, recipient, was, david, bennett, 57, this, successfully, extended, his, life, until, 8, march, 2022, 1, month, and, 30, days, by, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, heart, disease, had, surpassed, infectious, disease, as, the, leading, cause, of, death, in, the, united, states, and, it, is, currently, the, leading, cause, of, deaths, worldwide, since, 1948, the, ongoing, framingham, heart, study, has, shed, light, on, the, effects, of, various, influences, on, the, heart, including, diet, exercise, and, common, medications, such, as, aspirin, although, the, introduction, of, ace, inhibitors, and, beta, blockers, has, improved, the, management, of, chronic, heart, failure, the, disease, continues, to, be, an, enormous, medical, and, societal, burden, with, 30, to, 40, of, patients, dying, within, a, year, of, receiving, the, diagnosis, as, one, of, the, vital, organs, the, heart, was, long, identified, as, the, center, of, the, entire, body, the, seat, of, life, or, emotion, or, reason, will, intellect, purpose, or, the, mind, the, heart, is, an, emblematic, symbol, in, many, religions, signifying, truth, conscience, or, moral, courage, in, many, religions, the, temple, or, throne, of, god, in, islamic, and, judeo, christian, thought, the, divine, centre, or, atman, and, the, third, eye, of, transcendent, wisdom, in, hinduism, the, diamond, of, purity, and, essence, of, the, buddha, the, taoist, centre, of, understanding, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, word, for, heart, lev, is, used, in, these, meanings, as, the, seat, of, emotion, the, mind, and, referring, to, the, anatomical, organ, it, is, also, connected, in, function, and, symbolism, to, the, stomach, an, important, part, of, the, concept, of, the, soul, in, ancient, egyptian, religion, was, thought, to, be, the, heart, or, ib, the, ib, or, metaphysical, heart, was, believed, to, be, formed, from, one, drop, of, blood, from, the, child, s, mother, s, heart, taken, at, conception, to, ancient, egyptians, the, heart, was, the, seat, of, emotion, thought, will, and, intention, this, is, evidenced, by, egyptian, expressions, which, incorporate, the, word, ib, such, as, awi, ib, for, happy, literally, long, of, heart, xak, ib, for, estranged, literally, truncated, of, heart, in, egyptian, religion, the, heart, was, the, key, to, the, afterlife, it, was, conceived, as, surviving, death, in, the, nether, world, where, it, gave, evidence, for, or, against, its, possessor, the, heart, was, therefore, not, removed, from, the, body, during, mummification, and, was, believed, to, be, the, center, of, intelligence, and, feeling, and, needed, in, the, afterlife, it, was, thought, that, the, heart, was, examined, by, anubis, and, a, variety, of, deities, during, the, weighing, of, the, heart, ceremony, if, the, heart, weighed, more, than, the, feather, of, maat, which, symbolized, the, ideal, standard, of, behavior, if, the, scales, balanced, it, meant, the, heart, s, possessor, had, lived, a, just, life, and, could, enter, the, afterlife, if, the, heart, was, heavier, it, would, be, devoured, by, the, monster, ammit, the, chinese, character, for, heart, derives, from, a, comparatively, realistic, depiction, of, a, heart, indicating, the, heart, chambers, in, seal, script, the, chinese, word, x, n, also, takes, the, metaphorical, meanings, of, mind, intention, or, core, and, is, often, translated, as, heart, mind, as, the, ancient, chinese, believed, the, heart, was, the, center, of, human, cognition, in, chinese, medicine, the, heart, is, seen, as, the, center, of, sh, n, spirit, consciousness, the, heart, is, associated, with, the, small, intestine, tongue, governs, the, six, organs, and, five, viscera, and, belongs, to, fire, in, the, five, elements, the, sanskrit, word, for, heart, is, h, d, or, h, daya, found, in, the, oldest, surviving, sanskrit, text, the, rigveda, in, sanskrit, it, may, mean, both, the, anatomical, object, and, mind, or, soul, representing, the, seat, of, emotion, hrd, may, be, a, cognate, of, the, word, for, heart, in, greek, latin, and, english, many, classical, philosophers, and, scientists, including, aristotle, considered, the, heart, the, seat, of, thought, reason, or, emotion, often, disregarding, the, brain, as, contributing, to, those, functions, the, identification, of, the, heart, as, the, seat, of, emotions, in, particular, is, due, to, the, roman, physician, galen, who, also, located, the, seat, of, the, passions, in, the, liver, and, the, seat, of, reason, in, the, brain, the, heart, also, played, a, role, in, the, aztec, system, of, belief, the, most, common, form, of, human, sacrifice, practiced, by, the, aztecs, was, heart, extraction, the, aztec, believed, that, the, heart, tona, was, both, the, seat, of, the, individual, and, a, fragment, of, the, sun, s, heat, istli, to, this, day, the, nahua, consider, the, sun, to, be, a, heart, soul, tona, tiuh, round, hot, pulsating, indigenous, leaders, from, alaska, to, australia, came, together, in, 2020, to, deliver, a, message, to, the, world, that, humanity, needs, to, shift, from, the, mind, to, the, heart, and, let, our, heart, be, in, charge, of, what, we, do, the, message, was, made, into, a, film, which, highlighted, that, humanity, must, open, their, hearts, to, restore, balance, to, the, world, kumu, sabra, kauka, a, hawaiian, studies, educator, and, tradition, bearer, summed, up, the, message, of, the, film, saying, listen, to, your, heart, follow, your, path, may, it, be, clear, and, for, the, good, of, all, the, film, was, led, by, illarion, merculieff, from, the, aleut, unangan, tribe, merculieff, has, written, that, unangan, elders, referred, to, the, heart, as, a, source, of, wisdom, a, deeper, portal, of, profound, interconnectedness, and, awareness, that, exists, between, humans, and, all, living, things, in, catholicism, there, has, been, a, long, tradition, of, veneration, of, the, heart, stemming, from, worship, of, the, wounds, of, jesus, christ, which, gained, prominence, from, the, mid, sixteenth, century, this, tradition, influenced, the, development, of, the, medieval, christian, devotion, to, the, sacred, heart, of, jesus, and, the, parallel, veneration, of, the, immaculate, heart, of, mary, made, popular, by, john, eudes, there, are, also, many, references, to, the, heart, in, the, christian, bible, including, blessed, are, the, pure, in, heart, for, they, will, see, god, above, all, else, guard, your, heart, for, everything, you, do, flows, from, it, for, where, your, treasure, is, there, your, heart, will, be, also, for, as, a, man, thinks, in, his, heart, so, shall, he, be, the, expression, of, a, broken, heart, is, a, cross, cultural, reference, to, grief, for, a, lost, one, or, to, unfulfilled, romantic, love, the, notion, of, cupid, s, arrows, is, ancient, due, to, ovid, but, while, ovid, describes, cupid, as, wounding, his, victims, with, his, arrows, it, is, not, made, explicit, that, it, is, the, heart, that, is, wounded, the, familiar, iconography, of, cupid, shooting, little, heart, symbols, is, a, renaissance, theme, that, became, tied, to, valentine, s, day, in, certain, trans, new, guinea, languages, such, as, foi, and, momoona, the, heart, and, seat, of, emotions, are, colexified, meaning, they, share, the, same, word, animal, hearts, are, widely, consumed, as, food, as, they, are, almost, entirely, muscle, they, are, high, in, protein, they, are, often, included, in, dishes, with, other, offal, for, example, in, the, pan, ottoman, kokoretsi, chicken, hearts, are, considered, to, be, giblets, and, are, often, grilled, on, skewers, examples, of, this, are, japanese, h, to, yakitori, brazilian, churrasco, de, cora, o, and, indonesian, chicken, heart, satay, they, can, also, be, pan, fried, as, in, jerusalem, mixed, grill, in, egyptian, cuisine, they, can, be, used, finely, chopped, as, part, of, stuffing, for, chicken, many, recipes, combined, them, with, other, giblets, such, as, the, mexican, pollo, en, menudencias, and, the, russian, ragu, iz, kurinyikh, potrokhov, the, hearts, of, beef, pork, and, mutton, can, generally, be, interchanged, in, recipes, as, heart, is, a, hard, working, muscle, it, makes, for, firm, and, rather, dry, meat, so, is, generally, slow, cooked, another, way, of, dealing, with, toughness, is, to, julienne, the, meat, as, in, chinese, stir, fried, heart, beef, heart, may, be, grilled, or, braised, in, the, peruvian, anticuchos, de, coraz, n, barbecued, beef, hearts, are, grilled, after, being, tenderized, through, long, marination, in, a, spice, and, vinegar, mixture, an, australian, recipe, for, mock, goose, is, actually, braised, stuffed, beef, heart, pig, heart, is, stewed, poached, braised, or, made, into, sausage, the, balinese, oret, is, a, sort, of, blood, sausage, made, with, pig, heart, and, blood, a, french, recipe, for, c, ur, de, porc, l, orange, is, made, of, braised, heart, with, an, orange, sauce, the, size, of, the, heart, varies, among, the, different, animal, groups, with, hearts, in, vertebrates, ranging, from, those, of, the, smallest, mice, 12, mg, to, the, blue, whale, 600, kg, in, vertebrates, the, heart, lies, in, the, middle, of, the, ventral, part, of, the, body, surrounded, by, a, pericardium, which, in, some, fish, may, be, connected, to, the, peritoneum, the, sinoatrial, node, is, found, in, all, amniotes, but, not, in, more, primitive, vertebrates, in, these, animals, the, muscles, of, the, heart, are, relatively, continuous, and, the, sinus, venosus, coordinates, the, beat, which, passes, in, a, wave, through, the, remaining, chambers, since, the, sinus, venosus, is, incorporated, into, the, right, atrium, in, amniotes, it, is, likely, homologous, with, the, sa, node, in, teleosts, with, their, vestigial, sinus, venosus, the, main, centre, of, coordination, is, instead, in, the, atrium, the, rate, of, heartbeat, varies, enormously, between, different, species, ranging, from, around, 20, beats, per, minute, in, codfish, to, around, 600, in, hummingbirds, and, up, to, 1200, bpm, in, the, ruby, throated, hummingbird, adult, amphibians, and, most, reptiles, have, a, double, circulatory, system, meaning, a, circulatory, system, divided, into, arterial, and, venous, parts, however, the, heart, itself, is, not, completely, separated, into, two, sides, instead, it, is, separated, into, three, chambers, two, atria, and, one, ventricle, blood, returning, from, both, the, systemic, circulation, and, the, lungs, is, returned, and, blood, is, pumped, simultaneously, into, the, systemic, circulation, and, the, lungs, the, double, system, allows, blood, to, circulate, to, and, from, the, lungs, which, deliver, oxygenated, blood, directly, to, the, heart, in, reptiles, other, than, snakes, the, heart, is, usually, situated, around, the, middle, of, the, thorax, in, terrestrial, and, arboreal, snakes, it, is, usually, located, nearer, to, the, head, in, aquatic, species, the, heart, is, more, centrally, located, there, is, a, heart, with, three, chambers, two, atria, and, one, ventricle, the, form, and, function, of, these, hearts, are, different, from, mammalian, hearts, due, to, the, fact, that, snakes, have, an, elongated, body, and, thus, are, affected, by, different, environmental, factors, in, particular, the, snake, s, heart, relative, to, the, position, in, their, body, has, been, influenced, greatly, by, gravity, therefore, snakes, that, are, larger, in, size, tend, to, have, a, higher, blood, pressure, due, to, gravitational, change, the, ventricle, is, incompletely, separated, into, two, halves, by, a, wall, septum, with, a, considerable, gap, near, the, pulmonary, artery, and, aortic, openings, in, most, reptilian, species, there, appears, to, be, little, if, any, mixing, between, the, bloodstreams, so, the, aorta, receives, essentially, only, oxygenated, blood, the, exception, to, this, rule, is, crocodiles, which, have, a, four, chambered, heart, in, the, heart, of, lungfish, the, septum, extends, partway, into, the, ventricle, this, allows, for, some, degree, of, separation, between, the, de, oxygenated, bloodstream, destined, for, the, lungs, and, the, oxygenated, stream, that, is, delivered, to, the, rest, of, the, body, the, absence, of, such, a, division, in, living, amphibian, species, may, be, partly, due, to, the, amount, of, respiration, that, occurs, through, the, skin, thus, the, blood, returned, to, the, heart, through, the, venae, cavae, is, already, partially, oxygenated, as, a, result, there, may, be, less, need, for, a, finer, division, between, the, two, bloodstreams, than, in, lungfish, or, other, tetrapods, nonetheless, in, at, least, some, species, of, amphibian, the, spongy, nature, of, the, ventricle, does, seem, to, maintain, more, of, a, separation, between, the, bloodstreams, also, the, original, valves, of, the, conus, arteriosus, have, been, replaced, by, a, spiral, valve, that, divides, it, into, two, parallel, parts, thereby, helping, to, keep, the, two, bloodstreams, separate, archosaurs, crocodilians, and, birds, and, mammals, show, complete, separation, of, the, heart, into, two, pumps, for, a, total, of, four, heart, chambers, it, is, thought, that, the, four, chambered, heart, of, archosaurs, evolved, independently, from, that, of, mammals, in, crocodilians, there, is, a, small, opening, the, foramen, of, panizza, at, the, base, of, the, arterial, trunks, and, there, is, some, degree, of, mixing, between, the, blood, in, each, side, of, the, heart, during, a, dive, underwater, thus, only, in, birds, and, mammals, are, the, two, streams, of, blood, those, to, the, pulmonary, and, systemic, circulations, permanently, kept, entirely, separate, by, a, physical, barrier, the, heart, evolved, no, less, than, 380, million, years, ago, in, fish, fish, have, what, is, often, described, as, a, two, chambered, heart, consisting, of, one, atrium, to, receive, blood, and, one, ventricle, to, pump, it, however, the, fish, heart, has, entry, and, exit, compartments, that, may, be, called, chambers, so, it, is, also, sometimes, described, as, three, chambered, or, four, chambered, depending, on, what, is, counted, as, a, chamber, the, atrium, and, ventricle, are, sometimes, considered, true, chambers, while, the, others, are, considered, accessory, chambers, primitive, fish, have, a, four, chambered, heart, but, the, chambers, are, arranged, sequentially, so, that, this, primitive, heart, is, quite, unlike, the, four, chambered, hearts, of, mammals, and, birds, the, first, chamber, is, the, sinus, venosus, which, collects, deoxygenated, blood, from, the, body, through, the, hepatic, and, cardinal, veins, from, here, blood, flows, into, the, atrium, and, then, to, the, powerful, muscular, ventricle, where, the, main, pumping, action, will, take, place, the, fourth, and, final, chamber, is, the, conus, arteriosus, which, contains, several, valves, and, sends, blood, to, the, ventral, aorta, the, ventral, aorta, delivers, blood, to, the, gills, where, it, is, oxygenated, and, flows, through, the, dorsal, aorta, into, the, rest, of, the, body, in, tetrapods, the, ventral, aorta, has, divided, in, two, one, half, forms, the, ascending, aorta, while, the, other, forms, the, pulmonary, artery, in, the, adult, fish, the, four, chambers, are, not, arranged, in, a, straight, row, but, instead, form, an, s, shape, with, the, latter, two, chambers, lying, above, the, former, two, this, relatively, simple, pattern, is, found, in, cartilaginous, fish, and, in, the, ray, finned, fish, in, teleosts, the, conus, arteriosus, is, very, small, and, can, more, accurately, be, described, as, part, of, the, aorta, rather, than, of, the, heart, proper, the, conus, arteriosus, is, not, present, in, any, amniotes, presumably, having, been, absorbed, into, the, ventricles, over, the, course, of, evolution, similarly, while, the, sinus, venosus, is, present, as, a, vestigial, structure, in, some, reptiles, and, birds, it, is, otherwise, absorbed, into, the, right, atrium, and, is, no, longer, distinguishable, arthropods, and, most, mollusks, have, an, open, circulatory, system, in, this, system, deoxygenated, blood, collects, around, the, heart, in, cavities, sinuses, this, blood, slowly, permeates, the, heart, through, many, small, one, way, channels, the, heart, then, pumps, the, blood, into, the, hemocoel, a, cavity, between, the, organs, the, heart, in, arthropods, is, typically, a, muscular, tube, that, runs, the, length, of, the, body, under, the, back, and, from, the, base, of, the, head, instead, of, blood, the, circulatory, fluid, is, haemolymph, which, carries, the, most, commonly, used, respiratory, pigment, copper, based, haemocyanin, as, the, oxygen, transporter, haemoglobin, is, only, used, by, a, few, arthropods, in, some, other, invertebrates, such, as, earthworms, the, circulatory, system, is, not, used, to, transport, oxygen, and, so, is, much, reduced, having, no, veins, or, arteries, and, consisting, of, two, connected, tubes, oxygen, travels, by, diffusion, and, there, are, five, small, muscular, vessels, that, connect, these, vessels, that, contract, at, the, front, of, the, animals, that, can, be, thought, of, as, hearts, squids, and, other, cephalopods, have, two, gill, hearts, also, known, as, branchial, hearts, and, one, systemic, heart, the, branchial, hearts, have, two, atria, and, one, ventricle, each, and, pump, to, the, gills, whereas, the, systemic, heart, pumps, to, the, body, only, the, chordates, including, vertebrates, and, the, hemichordates, have, a, central, heart, which, is, a, vesicle, formed, from, the, thickening, of, the, aorta, and, contracts, to, pump, blood, this, suggests, a, presence, of, it, in, the, last, common, ancestor, of, these, groups, may, have, been, lost, in, the, echinoderms, this, article, incorporates, text, from, the, cc, by, book, openstax, college,
