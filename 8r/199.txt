deoxyribonucleic, acid, d, i, k, s, r, a, b, o, nj, u, k, l, i, k, k, l, e, dna, is, a, polymer, composed, of, two, polynucleotide, chains, that, coil, around, each, other, to, form, a, double, helix, the, polymer, carries, genetic, instructions, for, the, development, functioning, growth, and, reproduction, of, all, known, organisms, and, many, viruses, dna, and, ribonucleic, acid, rna, are, nucleic, acids, alongside, proteins, lipids, and, complex, carbohydrates, polysaccharides, nucleic, acids, are, one, of, the, four, major, types, of, macromolecules, that, are, essential, for, all, known, forms, of, life, the, two, dna, strands, are, known, as, polynucleotides, as, they, are, composed, of, simpler, monomeric, units, called, nucleotides, each, nucleotide, is, composed, of, one, of, four, nitrogen, containing, nucleobases, cytosine, guanine, adenine, or, thymine, a, sugar, called, deoxyribose, and, a, phosphate, group, the, nucleotides, are, joined, to, one, another, in, a, chain, by, covalent, bonds, known, as, the, phosphodiester, linkage, between, the, sugar, of, one, nucleotide, and, the, phosphate, of, the, next, resulting, in, an, alternating, sugar, phosphate, backbone, the, nitrogenous, bases, of, the, two, separate, polynucleotide, strands, are, bound, together, according, to, base, pairing, rules, a, with, t, and, c, with, g, with, hydrogen, bonds, to, make, double, stranded, dna, the, complementary, nitrogenous, bases, are, divided, into, two, groups, the, single, ringed, pyrimidines, and, the, double, ringed, purines, in, dna, the, pyrimidines, are, thymine, and, cytosine, the, purines, are, adenine, and, guanine, both, strands, of, double, stranded, dna, store, the, same, biological, information, this, information, is, replicated, when, the, two, strands, separate, a, large, part, of, dna, more, than, 98, for, humans, is, non, coding, meaning, that, these, sections, do, not, serve, as, patterns, for, protein, sequences, the, two, strands, of, dna, run, in, opposite, directions, to, each, other, and, are, thus, antiparallel, attached, to, each, sugar, is, one, of, four, types, of, nucleobases, or, bases, it, is, the, sequence, of, these, four, nucleobases, along, the, backbone, that, encodes, genetic, information, rna, strands, are, created, using, dna, strands, as, a, template, in, a, process, called, transcription, where, dna, bases, are, exchanged, for, their, corresponding, bases, except, in, the, case, of, thymine, t, for, which, rna, substitutes, uracil, u, under, the, genetic, code, these, rna, strands, specify, the, sequence, of, amino, acids, within, proteins, in, a, process, called, translation, within, eukaryotic, cells, dna, is, organized, into, long, structures, called, chromosomes, before, typical, cell, division, these, chromosomes, are, duplicated, in, the, process, of, dna, replication, providing, a, complete, set, of, chromosomes, for, each, daughter, cell, eukaryotic, organisms, animals, plants, fungi, and, protists, store, most, of, their, dna, inside, the, cell, nucleus, as, nuclear, dna, and, some, in, the, mitochondria, as, mitochondrial, dna, or, in, chloroplasts, as, chloroplast, dna, in, contrast, prokaryotes, bacteria, and, archaea, store, their, dna, only, in, the, cytoplasm, in, circular, chromosomes, within, eukaryotic, chromosomes, chromatin, proteins, such, as, histones, compact, and, organize, dna, these, compacting, structures, guide, the, interactions, between, dna, and, other, proteins, helping, control, which, parts, of, the, dna, are, transcribed, dna, is, a, long, polymer, made, from, repeating, units, called, nucleotides, the, structure, of, dna, is, dynamic, along, its, length, being, capable, of, coiling, into, tight, loops, and, other, shapes, in, all, species, it, is, composed, of, two, helical, chains, bound, to, each, other, by, hydrogen, bonds, both, chains, are, coiled, around, the, same, axis, and, have, the, same, pitch, of, 34, ngstr, ms, 3, 4, nm, the, pair, of, chains, have, a, radius, of, 10, 1, 0, nm, according, to, another, study, when, measured, in, a, different, solution, the, dna, chain, measured, 22, 26, 2, 2, 2, 6, nm, wide, and, one, nucleotide, unit, measured, 3, 3, 0, 33, nm, long, the, buoyant, density, of, most, dna, is, 1, 7g, cm, 3, dna, does, not, usually, exist, as, a, single, strand, but, instead, as, a, pair, of, strands, that, are, held, tightly, together, these, two, long, strands, coil, around, each, other, in, the, shape, of, a, double, helix, the, nucleotide, contains, both, a, segment, of, the, backbone, of, the, molecule, which, holds, the, chain, together, and, a, nucleobase, which, interacts, with, the, other, dna, strand, in, the, helix, a, nucleobase, linked, to, a, sugar, is, called, a, nucleoside, and, a, base, linked, to, a, sugar, and, to, one, or, more, phosphate, groups, is, called, a, nucleotide, a, biopolymer, comprising, multiple, linked, nucleotides, as, in, dna, is, called, a, polynucleotide, the, backbone, of, the, dna, strand, is, made, from, alternating, phosphate, and, sugar, groups, the, sugar, in, dna, is, 2, deoxyribose, which, is, a, pentose, five, carbon, sugar, the, sugars, are, joined, by, phosphate, groups, that, form, phosphodiester, bonds, between, the, third, and, fifth, carbon, atoms, of, adjacent, sugar, rings, these, are, known, as, the, 3, end, three, prime, end, and, 5, end, five, prime, end, carbons, the, prime, symbol, being, used, to, distinguish, these, carbon, atoms, from, those, of, the, base, to, which, the, deoxyribose, forms, a, glycosidic, bond, therefore, any, dna, strand, normally, has, one, end, at, which, there, is, a, phosphate, group, attached, to, the, 5, carbon, of, a, ribose, the, 5, phosphoryl, and, another, end, at, which, there, is, a, free, hydroxyl, group, attached, to, the, 3, carbon, of, a, ribose, the, 3, hydroxyl, the, orientation, of, the, 3, and, 5, carbons, along, the, sugar, phosphate, backbone, confers, directionality, sometimes, called, polarity, to, each, dna, strand, in, a, nucleic, acid, double, helix, the, direction, of, the, nucleotides, in, one, strand, is, opposite, to, their, direction, in, the, other, strand, the, strands, are, antiparallel, the, asymmetric, ends, of, dna, strands, are, said, to, have, a, directionality, of, five, prime, end, 5, and, three, prime, end, 3, with, the, 5, end, having, a, terminal, phosphate, group, and, the, 3, end, a, terminal, hydroxyl, group, one, major, difference, between, dna, and, rna, is, the, sugar, with, the, 2, deoxyribose, in, dna, being, replaced, by, the, related, pentose, sugar, ribose, in, rna, the, dna, double, helix, is, stabilized, primarily, by, two, forces, hydrogen, bonds, between, nucleotides, and, base, stacking, interactions, among, aromatic, nucleobases, the, four, bases, found, in, dna, are, adenine, a, cytosine, c, guanine, g, and, thymine, t, these, four, bases, are, attached, to, the, sugar, phosphate, to, form, the, complete, nucleotide, as, shown, for, adenosine, monophosphate, adenine, pairs, with, thymine, and, guanine, pairs, with, cytosine, forming, a, t, and, g, c, base, pairs, the, nucleobases, are, classified, into, two, types, the, purines, a, and, g, which, are, fused, five, and, six, membered, heterocyclic, compounds, and, the, pyrimidines, the, six, membered, rings, c, and, t, a, fifth, pyrimidine, nucleobase, uracil, u, usually, takes, the, place, of, thymine, in, rna, and, differs, from, thymine, by, lacking, a, methyl, group, on, its, ring, in, addition, to, rna, and, dna, many, artificial, nucleic, acid, analogues, have, been, created, to, study, the, properties, of, nucleic, acids, or, for, use, in, biotechnology, modified, bases, occur, in, dna, the, first, of, these, recognized, was, 5, methylcytosine, which, was, found, in, the, genome, of, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, in, 1925, the, reason, for, the, presence, of, these, noncanonical, bases, in, bacterial, viruses, bacteriophages, is, to, avoid, the, restriction, enzymes, present, in, bacteria, this, enzyme, system, acts, at, least, in, part, as, a, molecular, immune, system, protecting, bacteria, from, infection, by, viruses, modifications, of, the, bases, cytosine, and, adenine, the, more, common, and, modified, dna, bases, play, vital, roles, in, the, epigenetic, control, of, gene, expression, in, plants, and, animals, a, number, of, noncanonical, bases, are, known, to, occur, in, dna, most, of, these, are, modifications, of, the, canonical, bases, plus, uracil, twin, helical, strands, form, the, dna, backbone, another, double, helix, may, be, found, tracing, the, spaces, or, grooves, between, the, strands, these, voids, are, adjacent, to, the, base, pairs, and, may, provide, a, binding, site, as, the, strands, are, not, symmetrically, located, with, respect, to, each, other, the, grooves, are, unequally, sized, the, major, groove, is, 22, ngstr, ms, 2, 2, nm, wide, while, the, minor, groove, is, 12, 1, 2, nm, in, width, due, to, the, larger, width, of, the, major, groove, the, edges, of, the, bases, are, more, accessible, in, the, major, groove, than, in, the, minor, groove, as, a, result, proteins, such, as, transcription, factors, that, can, bind, to, specific, sequences, in, double, stranded, dna, usually, make, contact, with, the, sides, of, the, bases, exposed, in, the, major, groove, this, situation, varies, in, unusual, conformations, of, dna, within, the, cell, see, below, but, the, major, and, minor, grooves, are, always, named, to, reflect, the, differences, in, width, that, would, be, seen, if, the, dna, was, twisted, back, into, the, ordinary, b, form, in, a, dna, double, helix, each, type, of, nucleobase, on, one, strand, bonds, with, just, one, type, of, nucleobase, on, the, other, strand, this, is, called, complementary, base, pairing, purines, form, hydrogen, bonds, to, pyrimidines, with, adenine, bonding, only, to, thymine, in, two, hydrogen, bonds, and, cytosine, bonding, only, to, guanine, in, three, hydrogen, bonds, this, arrangement, of, two, nucleotides, binding, together, across, the, double, helix, from, six, carbon, ring, to, six, carbon, ring, is, called, a, watson, crick, base, pair, dna, with, high, gc, content, is, more, stable, than, dna, with, low, gc, content, a, hoogsteen, base, pair, hydrogen, bonding, the, 6, carbon, ring, to, the, 5, carbon, ring, is, a, rare, variation, of, base, pairing, as, hydrogen, bonds, are, not, covalent, they, can, be, broken, and, rejoined, relatively, easily, the, two, strands, of, dna, in, a, double, helix, can, thus, be, pulled, apart, like, a, zipper, either, by, a, mechanical, force, or, high, temperature, as, a, result, of, this, base, pair, complementarity, all, the, information, in, the, double, stranded, sequence, of, a, dna, helix, is, duplicated, on, each, strand, which, is, vital, in, dna, replication, this, reversible, and, specific, interaction, between, complementary, base, pairs, is, critical, for, all, the, functions, of, dna, in, organisms, most, dna, molecules, are, actually, two, polymer, strands, bound, together, in, a, helical, fashion, by, noncovalent, bonds, this, double, stranded, dsdna, structure, is, maintained, largely, by, the, intrastrand, base, stacking, interactions, which, are, strongest, for, g, c, stacks, the, two, strands, can, come, apart, a, process, known, as, melting, to, form, two, single, stranded, dna, ssdna, molecules, melting, occurs, at, high, temperatures, low, salt, and, high, ph, low, ph, also, melts, dna, but, since, dna, is, unstable, due, to, acid, depurination, low, ph, is, rarely, used, the, stability, of, the, dsdna, form, depends, not, only, on, the, gc, content, g, c, basepairs, but, also, on, sequence, since, stacking, is, sequence, specific, and, also, length, longer, molecules, are, more, stable, the, stability, can, be, measured, in, various, ways, a, common, way, is, the, melting, temperature, also, called, t, m, value, which, is, the, temperature, at, which, 50, of, the, double, strand, molecules, are, converted, to, single, strand, molecules, melting, temperature, is, dependent, on, ionic, strength, and, the, concentration, of, dna, as, a, result, it, is, both, the, percentage, of, gc, base, pairs, and, the, overall, length, of, a, dna, double, helix, that, determines, the, strength, of, the, association, between, the, two, strands, of, dna, long, dna, helices, with, a, high, gc, content, have, more, strongly, interacting, strands, while, short, helices, with, high, at, content, have, more, weakly, interacting, strands, in, biology, parts, of, the, dna, double, helix, that, need, to, separate, easily, such, as, the, tataat, pribnow, box, in, some, promoters, tend, to, have, a, high, at, content, making, the, strands, easier, to, pull, apart, in, the, laboratory, the, strength, of, this, interaction, can, be, measured, by, finding, the, melting, temperature, t, m, necessary, to, break, half, of, the, hydrogen, bonds, when, all, the, base, pairs, in, a, dna, double, helix, melt, the, strands, separate, and, exist, in, solution, as, two, entirely, independent, molecules, these, single, stranded, dna, molecules, have, no, single, common, shape, but, some, conformations, are, more, stable, than, others, in, humans, the, total, female, diploid, nuclear, genome, per, cell, extends, for, 6, 37, gigabase, pairs, gbp, is, 208, 23, cm, long, and, weighs, 6, 51, picograms, pg, male, values, are, 6, 27, gbp, 205, 00, cm, 6, 41, pg, each, dna, polymer, can, contain, hundreds, of, millions, of, nucleotides, such, as, in, chromosome, 1, chromosome, 1, is, the, largest, human, chromosome, with, approximately, 220, million, base, pairs, and, would, be, 85, mm, long, if, straightened, in, eukaryotes, in, addition, to, nuclear, dna, there, is, also, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, which, encodes, certain, proteins, used, by, the, mitochondria, the, mtdna, is, usually, relatively, small, in, comparison, to, the, nuclear, dna, for, example, the, human, mitochondrial, dna, forms, closed, circular, molecules, each, of, which, contains, 16, 569, dna, base, pairs, with, each, such, molecule, normally, containing, a, full, set, of, the, mitochondrial, genes, each, human, mitochondrion, contains, on, average, approximately, 5, such, mtdna, molecules, each, human, cell, contains, approximately, 100, mitochondria, giving, a, total, number, of, mtdna, molecules, per, human, cell, of, approximately, 500, however, the, amount, of, mitochondria, per, cell, also, varies, by, cell, type, and, an, egg, cell, can, contain, 100, 000, mitochondria, corresponding, to, up, to, 1, 500, 000, copies, of, the, mitochondrial, genome, constituting, up, to, 90, of, the, dna, of, the, cell, a, dna, sequence, is, called, a, sense, sequence, if, it, is, the, same, as, that, of, a, messenger, rna, copy, that, is, translated, into, protein, the, sequence, on, the, opposite, strand, is, called, the, antisense, sequence, both, sense, and, antisense, sequences, can, exist, on, different, parts, of, the, same, strand, of, dna, i, e, both, strands, can, contain, both, sense, and, antisense, sequences, in, both, prokaryotes, and, eukaryotes, antisense, rna, sequences, are, produced, but, the, functions, of, these, rnas, are, not, entirely, clear, one, proposal, is, that, antisense, rnas, are, involved, in, regulating, gene, expression, through, rna, rna, base, pairing, a, few, dna, sequences, in, prokaryotes, and, eukaryotes, and, more, in, plasmids, and, viruses, blur, the, distinction, between, sense, and, antisense, strands, by, having, overlapping, genes, in, these, cases, some, dna, sequences, do, double, duty, encoding, one, protein, when, read, along, one, strand, and, a, second, protein, when, read, in, the, opposite, direction, along, the, other, strand, in, bacteria, this, overlap, may, be, involved, in, the, regulation, of, gene, transcription, while, in, viruses, overlapping, genes, increase, the, amount, of, information, that, can, be, encoded, within, the, small, viral, genome, dna, can, be, twisted, like, a, rope, in, a, process, called, dna, supercoiling, with, dna, in, its, relaxed, state, a, strand, usually, circles, the, axis, of, the, double, helix, once, every, 10, 4, base, pairs, but, if, the, dna, is, twisted, the, strands, become, more, tightly, or, more, loosely, wound, if, the, dna, is, twisted, in, the, direction, of, the, helix, this, is, positive, supercoiling, and, the, bases, are, held, more, tightly, together, if, they, are, twisted, in, the, opposite, direction, this, is, negative, supercoiling, and, the, bases, come, apart, more, easily, in, nature, most, dna, has, slight, negative, supercoiling, that, is, introduced, by, enzymes, called, topoisomerases, these, enzymes, are, also, needed, to, relieve, the, twisting, stresses, introduced, into, dna, strands, during, processes, such, as, transcription, and, dna, replication, dna, exists, in, many, possible, conformations, that, include, a, dna, b, dna, and, z, dna, forms, although, only, b, dna, and, z, dna, have, been, directly, observed, in, functional, organisms, the, conformation, that, dna, adopts, depends, on, the, hydration, level, dna, sequence, the, amount, and, direction, of, supercoiling, chemical, modifications, of, the, bases, the, type, and, concentration, of, metal, ions, and, the, presence, of, polyamines, in, solution, the, first, published, reports, of, a, dna, x, ray, diffraction, patterns, and, also, b, dna, used, analyses, based, on, patterson, functions, that, provided, only, a, limited, amount, of, structural, information, for, oriented, fibers, of, dna, an, alternative, analysis, was, proposed, by, wilkins, et, al, in, 1953, for, the, in, vivo, b, dna, x, ray, diffraction, scattering, patterns, of, highly, hydrated, dna, fibers, in, terms, of, squares, of, bessel, functions, in, the, same, journal, james, watson, and, francis, crick, presented, their, molecular, modeling, analysis, of, the, dna, x, ray, diffraction, patterns, to, suggest, that, the, structure, was, a, double, helix, although, the, b, dna, form, is, most, common, under, the, conditions, found, in, cells, it, is, not, a, well, defined, conformation, but, a, family, of, related, dna, conformations, that, occur, at, the, high, hydration, levels, present, in, cells, their, corresponding, x, ray, diffraction, and, scattering, patterns, are, characteristic, of, molecular, paracrystals, with, a, significant, degree, of, disorder, compared, to, b, dna, the, a, dna, form, is, a, wider, right, handed, spiral, with, a, shallow, wide, minor, groove, and, a, narrower, deeper, major, groove, the, a, form, occurs, under, non, physiological, conditions, in, partly, dehydrated, samples, of, dna, while, in, the, cell, it, may, be, produced, in, hybrid, pairings, of, dna, and, rna, strands, and, in, enzyme, dna, complexes, segments, of, dna, where, the, bases, have, been, chemically, modified, by, methylation, may, undergo, a, larger, change, in, conformation, and, adopt, the, z, form, here, the, strands, turn, about, the, helical, axis, in, a, left, handed, spiral, the, opposite, of, the, more, common, b, form, these, unusual, structures, can, be, recognized, by, specific, z, dna, binding, proteins, and, may, be, involved, in, the, regulation, of, transcription, for, many, years, exobiologists, have, proposed, the, existence, of, a, shadow, biosphere, a, postulated, microbial, biosphere, of, earth, that, uses, radically, different, biochemical, and, molecular, processes, than, currently, known, life, one, of, the, proposals, was, the, existence, of, lifeforms, that, use, arsenic, instead, of, phosphorus, in, dna, a, report, in, 2010, of, the, possibility, in, the, bacterium, gfaj, 1, was, announced, though, the, research, was, disputed, and, evidence, suggests, the, bacterium, actively, prevents, the, incorporation, of, arsenic, into, the, dna, backbone, and, other, biomolecules, at, the, ends, of, the, linear, chromosomes, are, specialized, regions, of, dna, called, telomeres, the, main, function, of, these, regions, is, to, allow, the, cell, to, replicate, chromosome, ends, using, the, enzyme, telomerase, as, the, enzymes, that, normally, replicate, dna, cannot, copy, the, extreme, 3, ends, of, chromosomes, these, specialized, chromosome, caps, also, help, protect, the, dna, ends, and, stop, the, dna, repair, systems, in, the, cell, from, treating, them, as, damage, to, be, corrected, in, human, cells, telomeres, are, usually, lengths, of, single, stranded, dna, containing, several, thousand, repeats, of, a, simple, ttaggg, sequence, these, guanine, rich, sequences, may, stabilize, chromosome, ends, by, forming, structures, of, stacked, sets, of, four, base, units, rather, than, the, usual, base, pairs, found, in, other, dna, molecules, here, four, guanine, bases, known, as, a, guanine, tetrad, form, a, flat, plate, these, flat, four, base, units, then, stack, on, top, of, each, other, to, form, a, stable, g, quadruplex, structure, these, structures, are, stabilized, by, hydrogen, bonding, between, the, edges, of, the, bases, and, chelation, of, a, metal, ion, in, the, centre, of, each, four, base, unit, other, structures, can, also, be, formed, with, the, central, set, of, four, bases, coming, from, either, a, single, strand, folded, around, the, bases, or, several, different, parallel, strands, each, contributing, one, base, to, the, central, structure, in, addition, to, these, stacked, structures, telomeres, also, form, large, loop, structures, called, telomere, loops, or, t, loops, here, the, single, stranded, dna, curls, around, in, a, long, circle, stabilized, by, telomere, binding, proteins, at, the, very, end, of, the, t, loop, the, single, stranded, telomere, dna, is, held, onto, a, region, of, double, stranded, dna, by, the, telomere, strand, disrupting, the, double, helical, dna, and, base, pairing, to, one, of, the, two, strands, this, triple, stranded, structure, is, called, a, displacement, loop, or, d, loop, in, dna, fraying, occurs, when, non, complementary, regions, exist, at, the, end, of, an, otherwise, complementary, double, strand, of, dna, however, branched, dna, can, occur, if, a, third, strand, of, dna, is, introduced, and, contains, adjoining, regions, able, to, hybridize, with, the, frayed, regions, of, the, pre, existing, double, strand, although, the, simplest, example, of, branched, dna, involves, only, three, strands, of, dna, complexes, involving, additional, strands, and, multiple, branches, are, also, possible, branched, dna, can, be, used, in, nanotechnology, to, construct, geometric, shapes, see, the, section, on, uses, in, technology, below, several, artificial, nucleobases, have, been, synthesized, and, successfully, incorporated, in, the, eight, base, dna, analogue, named, hachimoji, dna, dubbed, s, b, p, and, z, these, artificial, bases, are, capable, of, bonding, with, each, other, in, a, predictable, way, s, b, and, p, z, maintain, the, double, helix, structure, of, dna, and, be, transcribed, to, rna, their, existence, could, be, seen, as, an, indication, that, there, is, nothing, special, about, the, four, natural, nucleobases, that, evolved, on, earth, on, the, other, hand, dna, is, tightly, related, to, rna, which, does, not, only, act, as, a, transcript, of, dna, but, also, performs, as, molecular, machines, many, tasks, in, cells, for, this, purpose, it, has, to, fold, into, a, structure, it, has, been, shown, that, to, allow, to, create, all, possible, structures, at, least, four, bases, are, required, for, the, corresponding, rna, while, a, higher, number, is, also, possible, but, this, would, be, against, the, natural, principle, of, least, effort, the, phosphate, groups, of, dna, give, it, similar, acidic, properties, to, phosphoric, acid, and, it, can, be, considered, as, a, strong, acid, it, will, be, fully, ionized, at, a, normal, cellular, ph, releasing, protons, which, leave, behind, negative, charges, on, the, phosphate, groups, these, negative, charges, protect, dna, from, breakdown, by, hydrolysis, by, repelling, nucleophiles, which, could, hydrolyze, it, pure, dna, extracted, from, cells, forms, white, stringy, clumps, the, expression, of, genes, is, influenced, by, how, the, dna, is, packaged, in, chromosomes, in, a, structure, called, chromatin, base, modifications, can, be, involved, in, packaging, with, regions, that, have, low, or, no, gene, expression, usually, containing, high, levels, of, methylation, of, cytosine, bases, dna, packaging, and, its, influence, on, gene, expression, can, also, occur, by, covalent, modifications, of, the, histone, protein, core, around, which, dna, is, wrapped, in, the, chromatin, structure, or, else, by, remodeling, carried, out, by, chromatin, remodeling, complexes, see, chromatin, remodeling, there, is, further, crosstalk, between, dna, methylation, and, histone, modification, so, they, can, coordinately, affect, chromatin, and, gene, expression, for, one, example, cytosine, methylation, produces, 5, methylcytosine, which, is, important, for, x, inactivation, of, chromosomes, the, average, level, of, methylation, varies, between, organisms, the, worm, caenorhabditis, elegans, lacks, cytosine, methylation, while, vertebrates, have, higher, levels, with, up, to, 1, of, their, dna, containing, 5, methylcytosine, despite, the, importance, of, 5, methylcytosine, it, can, deaminate, to, leave, a, thymine, base, so, methylated, cytosines, are, particularly, prone, to, mutations, other, base, modifications, include, adenine, methylation, in, bacteria, the, presence, of, 5, hydroxymethylcytosine, in, the, brain, and, the, glycosylation, of, uracil, to, produce, the, j, base, in, kinetoplastids, dna, can, be, damaged, by, many, sorts, of, mutagens, which, change, the, dna, sequence, mutagens, include, oxidizing, agents, alkylating, agents, and, also, high, energy, electromagnetic, radiation, such, as, ultraviolet, light, and, x, rays, the, type, of, dna, damage, produced, depends, on, the, type, of, mutagen, for, example, uv, light, can, damage, dna, by, producing, thymine, dimers, which, are, cross, links, between, pyrimidine, bases, on, the, other, hand, oxidants, such, as, free, radicals, or, hydrogen, peroxide, produce, multiple, forms, of, damage, including, base, modifications, particularly, of, guanosine, and, double, strand, breaks, a, typical, human, cell, contains, about, 150, 000, bases, that, have, suffered, oxidative, damage, of, these, oxidative, lesions, the, most, dangerous, are, double, strand, breaks, as, these, are, difficult, to, repair, and, can, produce, point, mutations, insertions, deletions, from, the, dna, sequence, and, chromosomal, translocations, these, mutations, can, cause, cancer, because, of, inherent, limits, in, the, dna, repair, mechanisms, if, humans, lived, long, enough, they, would, all, eventually, develop, cancer, dna, damages, that, are, naturally, occurring, due, to, normal, cellular, processes, that, produce, reactive, oxygen, species, the, hydrolytic, activities, of, cellular, water, etc, also, occur, frequently, although, most, of, these, damages, are, repaired, in, any, cell, some, dna, damage, may, remain, despite, the, action, of, repair, processes, these, remaining, dna, damages, accumulate, with, age, in, mammalian, postmitotic, tissues, this, accumulation, appears, to, be, an, important, underlying, cause, of, aging, many, mutagens, fit, into, the, space, between, two, adjacent, base, pairs, this, is, called, intercalation, most, intercalators, are, aromatic, and, planar, molecules, examples, include, ethidium, bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and, doxorubicin, for, an, intercalator, to, fit, between, base, pairs, the, bases, must, separate, distorting, the, dna, strands, by, unwinding, of, the, double, helix, this, inhibits, both, transcription, and, dna, replication, causing, toxicity, and, mutations, as, a, result, dna, intercalators, may, be, carcinogens, and, in, the, case, of, thalidomide, a, teratogen, others, such, as, benzo, pyrene, diol, epoxide, and, aflatoxin, form, dna, adducts, that, induce, errors, in, replication, nevertheless, due, to, their, ability, to, inhibit, dna, transcription, and, replication, other, similar, toxins, are, also, used, in, chemotherapy, to, inhibit, rapidly, growing, cancer, cells, dna, usually, occurs, as, linear, chromosomes, in, eukaryotes, and, circular, chromosomes, in, prokaryotes, the, set, of, chromosomes, in, a, cell, makes, up, its, genome, the, human, genome, has, approximately, 3, billion, base, pairs, of, dna, arranged, into, 46, chromosomes, the, information, carried, by, dna, is, held, in, the, sequence, of, pieces, of, dna, called, genes, transmission, of, genetic, information, in, genes, is, achieved, via, complementary, base, pairing, for, example, in, transcription, when, a, cell, uses, the, information, in, a, gene, the, dna, sequence, is, copied, into, a, complementary, rna, sequence, through, the, attraction, between, the, dna, and, the, correct, rna, nucleotides, usually, this, rna, copy, is, then, used, to, make, a, matching, protein, sequence, in, a, process, called, translation, which, depends, on, the, same, interaction, between, rna, nucleotides, in, an, alternative, fashion, a, cell, may, copy, its, genetic, information, in, a, process, called, dna, replication, the, details, of, these, functions, are, covered, in, other, articles, here, the, focus, is, on, the, interactions, between, dna, and, other, molecules, that, mediate, the, function, of, the, genome, genomic, dna, is, tightly, and, orderly, packed, in, the, process, called, dna, condensation, to, fit, the, small, available, volumes, of, the, cell, in, eukaryotes, dna, is, located, in, the, cell, nucleus, with, small, amounts, in, mitochondria, and, chloroplasts, in, prokaryotes, the, dna, is, held, within, an, irregularly, shaped, body, in, the, cytoplasm, called, the, nucleoid, the, genetic, information, in, a, genome, is, held, within, genes, and, the, complete, set, of, this, information, in, an, organism, is, called, its, genotype, a, gene, is, a, unit, of, heredity, and, is, a, region, of, dna, that, influences, a, particular, characteristic, in, an, organism, genes, contain, an, open, reading, frame, that, can, be, transcribed, and, regulatory, sequences, such, as, promoters, and, enhancers, which, control, transcription, of, the, open, reading, frame, in, many, species, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, total, sequence, of, the, genome, encodes, protein, for, example, only, about, 1, 5, of, the, human, genome, consists, of, protein, coding, exons, with, over, 50, of, human, dna, consisting, of, non, coding, repetitive, sequences, the, reasons, for, the, presence, of, so, much, noncoding, dna, in, eukaryotic, genomes, and, the, extraordinary, differences, in, genome, size, or, c, value, among, species, represent, a, long, standing, puzzle, known, as, the, c, value, enigma, however, some, dna, sequences, that, do, not, code, protein, may, still, encode, functional, non, coding, rna, molecules, which, are, involved, in, the, regulation, of, gene, expression, some, noncoding, dna, sequences, play, structural, roles, in, chromosomes, telomeres, and, centromeres, typically, contain, few, genes, but, are, important, for, the, function, and, stability, of, chromosomes, an, abundant, form, of, noncoding, dna, in, humans, are, pseudogenes, which, are, copies, of, genes, that, have, been, disabled, by, mutation, these, sequences, are, usually, just, molecular, fossils, although, they, can, occasionally, serve, as, raw, genetic, material, for, the, creation, of, new, genes, through, the, process, of, gene, duplication, and, divergence, a, gene, is, a, sequence, of, dna, that, contains, genetic, information, and, can, influence, the, phenotype, of, an, organism, within, a, gene, the, sequence, of, bases, along, a, dna, strand, defines, a, messenger, rna, sequence, which, then, defines, one, or, more, protein, sequences, the, relationship, between, the, nucleotide, sequences, of, genes, and, the, amino, acid, sequences, of, proteins, is, determined, by, the, rules, of, translation, known, collectively, as, the, genetic, code, the, genetic, code, consists, of, three, letter, words, called, codons, formed, from, a, sequence, of, three, nucleotides, e, g, act, cag, ttt, in, transcription, the, codons, of, a, gene, are, copied, into, messenger, rna, by, rna, polymerase, this, rna, copy, is, then, decoded, by, a, ribosome, that, reads, the, rna, sequence, by, base, pairing, the, messenger, rna, to, transfer, rna, which, carries, amino, acids, since, there, are, 4, bases, in, 3, letter, combinations, there, are, 64, possible, codons, 4, 3, combinations, these, encode, the, twenty, standard, amino, acids, giving, most, amino, acids, more, than, one, possible, codon, there, are, also, three, stop, or, nonsense, codons, signifying, the, end, of, the, coding, region, these, are, the, tag, taa, and, tga, codons, uag, uaa, and, uga, on, the, mrna, cell, division, is, essential, for, an, organism, to, grow, but, when, a, cell, divides, it, must, replicate, the, dna, in, its, genome, so, that, the, two, daughter, cells, have, the, same, genetic, information, as, their, parent, the, double, stranded, structure, of, dna, provides, a, simple, mechanism, for, dna, replication, here, the, two, strands, are, separated, and, then, each, strand, s, complementary, dna, sequence, is, recreated, by, an, enzyme, called, dna, polymerase, this, enzyme, makes, the, complementary, strand, by, finding, the, correct, base, through, complementary, base, pairing, and, bonding, it, onto, the, original, strand, as, dna, polymerases, can, only, extend, a, dna, strand, in, a, 5, to, 3, direction, different, mechanisms, are, used, to, copy, the, antiparallel, strands, of, the, double, helix, in, this, way, the, base, on, the, old, strand, dictates, which, base, appears, on, the, new, strand, and, the, cell, ends, up, with, a, perfect, copy, of, its, dna, naked, extracellular, dna, edna, most, of, it, released, by, cell, death, is, nearly, ubiquitous, in, the, environment, its, concentration, in, soil, may, be, as, high, as, 2, g, l, and, its, concentration, in, natural, aquatic, environments, may, be, as, high, at, 88, g, l, various, possible, functions, have, been, proposed, for, edna, it, may, be, involved, in, horizontal, gene, transfer, it, may, provide, nutrients, and, it, may, act, as, a, buffer, to, recruit, or, titrate, ions, or, antibiotics, extracellular, dna, acts, as, a, functional, extracellular, matrix, component, in, the, biofilms, of, several, bacterial, species, it, may, act, as, a, recognition, factor, to, regulate, the, attachment, and, dispersal, of, specific, cell, types, in, the, biofilm, it, may, contribute, to, biofilm, formation, and, it, may, contribute, to, the, biofilm, s, physical, strength, and, resistance, to, biological, stress, cell, free, fetal, dna, is, found, in, the, blood, of, the, mother, and, can, be, sequenced, to, determine, a, great, deal, of, information, about, the, developing, fetus, under, the, name, of, environmental, dna, edna, has, seen, increased, use, in, the, natural, sciences, as, a, survey, tool, for, ecology, monitoring, the, movements, and, presence, of, species, in, water, air, or, on, land, and, assessing, an, area, s, biodiversity, neutrophil, extracellular, traps, nets, are, networks, of, extracellular, fibers, primarily, composed, of, dna, which, allow, neutrophils, a, type, of, white, blood, cell, to, kill, extracellular, pathogens, while, minimizing, damage, to, the, host, cells, all, the, functions, of, dna, depend, on, interactions, with, proteins, these, protein, interactions, can, be, non, specific, or, the, protein, can, bind, specifically, to, a, single, dna, sequence, enzymes, can, also, bind, to, dna, and, of, these, the, polymerases, that, copy, the, dna, base, sequence, in, transcription, and, dna, replication, are, particularly, important, structural, proteins, that, bind, dna, are, well, understood, examples, of, non, specific, dna, protein, interactions, within, chromosomes, dna, is, held, in, complexes, with, structural, proteins, these, proteins, organize, the, dna, into, a, compact, structure, called, chromatin, in, eukaryotes, this, structure, involves, dna, binding, to, a, complex, of, small, basic, proteins, called, histones, while, in, prokaryotes, multiple, types, of, proteins, are, involved, the, histones, form, a, disk, shaped, complex, called, a, nucleosome, which, contains, two, complete, turns, of, double, stranded, dna, wrapped, around, its, surface, these, non, specific, interactions, are, formed, through, basic, residues, in, the, histones, making, ionic, bonds, to, the, acidic, sugar, phosphate, backbone, of, the, dna, and, are, thus, largely, independent, of, the, base, sequence, chemical, modifications, of, these, basic, amino, acid, residues, include, methylation, phosphorylation, and, acetylation, these, chemical, changes, alter, the, strength, of, the, interaction, between, the, dna, and, the, histones, making, the, dna, more, or, less, accessible, to, transcription, factors, and, changing, the, rate, of, transcription, other, non, specific, dna, binding, proteins, in, chromatin, include, the, high, mobility, group, proteins, which, bind, to, bent, or, distorted, dna, these, proteins, are, important, in, bending, arrays, of, nucleosomes, and, arranging, them, into, the, larger, structures, that, make, up, chromosomes, a, distinct, group, of, dna, binding, proteins, is, the, dna, binding, proteins, that, specifically, bind, single, stranded, dna, in, humans, replication, protein, a, is, the, best, understood, member, of, this, family, and, is, used, in, processes, where, the, double, helix, is, separated, including, dna, replication, recombination, and, dna, repair, these, binding, proteins, seem, to, stabilize, single, stranded, dna, and, protect, it, from, forming, stem, loops, or, being, degraded, by, nucleases, in, contrast, other, proteins, have, evolved, to, bind, to, particular, dna, sequences, the, most, intensively, studied, of, these, are, the, various, transcription, factors, which, are, proteins, that, regulate, transcription, each, transcription, factor, binds, to, one, particular, set, of, dna, sequences, and, activates, or, inhibits, the, transcription, of, genes, that, have, these, sequences, close, to, their, promoters, the, transcription, factors, do, this, in, two, ways, firstly, they, can, bind, the, rna, polymerase, responsible, for, transcription, either, directly, or, through, other, mediator, proteins, this, locates, the, polymerase, at, the, promoter, and, allows, it, to, begin, transcription, alternatively, transcription, factors, can, bind, enzymes, that, modify, the, histones, at, the, promoter, this, changes, the, accessibility, of, the, dna, template, to, the, polymerase, as, these, dna, targets, can, occur, throughout, an, organism, s, genome, changes, in, the, activity, of, one, type, of, transcription, factor, can, affect, thousands, of, genes, consequently, these, proteins, are, often, the, targets, of, the, signal, transduction, processes, that, control, responses, to, environmental, changes, or, cellular, differentiation, and, development, the, specificity, of, these, transcription, factors, interactions, with, dna, come, from, the, proteins, making, multiple, contacts, to, the, edges, of, the, dna, bases, allowing, them, to, read, the, dna, sequence, most, of, these, base, interactions, are, made, in, the, major, groove, where, the, bases, are, most, accessible, nucleases, are, enzymes, that, cut, dna, strands, by, catalyzing, the, hydrolysis, of, the, phosphodiester, bonds, nucleases, that, hydrolyse, nucleotides, from, the, ends, of, dna, strands, are, called, exonucleases, while, endonucleases, cut, within, strands, the, most, frequently, used, nucleases, in, molecular, biology, are, the, restriction, endonucleases, which, cut, dna, at, specific, sequences, for, instance, the, ecorv, enzyme, shown, to, the, left, recognizes, the, 6, base, sequence, 5, gatatc, 3, and, makes, a, cut, at, the, horizontal, line, in, nature, these, enzymes, protect, bacteria, against, phage, infection, by, digesting, the, phage, dna, when, it, enters, the, bacterial, cell, acting, as, part, of, the, restriction, modification, system, in, technology, these, sequence, specific, nucleases, are, used, in, molecular, cloning, and, dna, fingerprinting, enzymes, called, dna, ligases, can, rejoin, cut, or, broken, dna, strands, ligases, are, particularly, important, in, lagging, strand, dna, replication, as, they, join, the, short, segments, of, dna, produced, at, the, replication, fork, into, a, complete, copy, of, the, dna, template, they, are, also, used, in, dna, repair, and, genetic, recombination, topoisomerases, are, enzymes, with, both, nuclease, and, ligase, activity, these, proteins, change, the, amount, of, supercoiling, in, dna, some, of, these, enzymes, work, by, cutting, the, dna, helix, and, allowing, one, section, to, rotate, thereby, reducing, its, level, of, supercoiling, the, enzyme, then, seals, the, dna, break, other, types, of, these, enzymes, are, capable, of, cutting, one, dna, helix, and, then, passing, a, second, strand, of, dna, through, this, break, before, rejoining, the, helix, topoisomerases, are, required, for, many, processes, involving, dna, such, as, dna, replication, and, transcription, helicases, are, proteins, that, are, a, type, of, molecular, motor, they, use, the, chemical, energy, in, nucleoside, triphosphates, predominantly, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, to, break, hydrogen, bonds, between, bases, and, unwind, the, dna, double, helix, into, single, strands, these, enzymes, are, essential, for, most, processes, where, enzymes, need, to, access, the, dna, bases, polymerases, are, enzymes, that, synthesize, polynucleotide, chains, from, nucleoside, triphosphates, the, sequence, of, their, products, is, created, based, on, existing, polynucleotide, chains, which, are, called, templates, these, enzymes, function, by, repeatedly, adding, a, nucleotide, to, the, 3, hydroxyl, group, at, the, end, of, the, growing, polynucleotide, chain, as, a, consequence, all, polymerases, work, in, a, 5, to, 3, direction, in, the, active, site, of, these, enzymes, the, incoming, nucleoside, triphosphate, base, pairs, to, the, template, this, allows, polymerases, to, accurately, synthesize, the, complementary, strand, of, their, template, polymerases, are, classified, according, to, the, type, of, template, that, they, use, in, dna, replication, dna, dependent, dna, polymerases, make, copies, of, dna, polynucleotide, chains, to, preserve, biological, information, it, is, essential, that, the, sequence, of, bases, in, each, copy, are, precisely, complementary, to, the, sequence, of, bases, in, the, template, strand, many, dna, polymerases, have, a, proofreading, activity, here, the, polymerase, recognizes, the, occasional, mistakes, in, the, synthesis, reaction, by, the, lack, of, base, pairing, between, the, mismatched, nucleotides, if, a, mismatch, is, detected, a, 3, to, 5, exonuclease, activity, is, activated, and, the, incorrect, base, removed, in, most, organisms, dna, polymerases, function, in, a, large, complex, called, the, replisome, that, contains, multiple, accessory, subunits, such, as, the, dna, clamp, or, helicases, rna, dependent, dna, polymerases, are, a, specialized, class, of, polymerases, that, copy, the, sequence, of, an, rna, strand, into, dna, they, include, reverse, transcriptase, which, is, a, viral, enzyme, involved, in, the, infection, of, cells, by, retroviruses, and, telomerase, which, is, required, for, the, replication, of, telomeres, for, example, hiv, reverse, transcriptase, is, an, enzyme, for, aids, virus, replication, telomerase, is, an, unusual, polymerase, because, it, contains, its, own, rna, template, as, part, of, its, structure, it, synthesizes, telomeres, at, the, ends, of, chromosomes, telomeres, prevent, fusion, of, the, ends, of, neighboring, chromosomes, and, protect, chromosome, ends, from, damage, transcription, is, carried, out, by, a, dna, dependent, rna, polymerase, that, copies, the, sequence, of, a, dna, strand, into, rna, to, begin, transcribing, a, gene, the, rna, polymerase, binds, to, a, sequence, of, dna, called, a, promoter, and, separates, the, dna, strands, it, then, copies, the, gene, sequence, into, a, messenger, rna, transcript, until, it, reaches, a, region, of, dna, called, the, terminator, where, it, halts, and, detaches, from, the, dna, as, with, human, dna, dependent, dna, polymerases, rna, polymerase, ii, the, enzyme, that, transcribes, most, of, the, genes, in, the, human, genome, operates, as, part, of, a, large, protein, complex, with, multiple, regulatory, and, accessory, subunits, a, dna, helix, usually, does, not, interact, with, other, segments, of, dna, and, in, human, cells, the, different, chromosomes, even, occupy, separate, areas, in, the, nucleus, called, chromosome, territories, this, physical, separation, of, different, chromosomes, is, important, for, the, ability, of, dna, to, function, as, a, stable, repository, for, information, as, one, of, the, few, times, chromosomes, interact, is, in, chromosomal, crossover, which, occurs, during, sexual, reproduction, when, genetic, recombination, occurs, chromosomal, crossover, is, when, two, dna, helices, break, swap, a, section, and, then, rejoin, recombination, allows, chromosomes, to, exchange, genetic, information, and, produces, new, combinations, of, genes, which, increases, the, efficiency, of, natural, selection, and, can, be, important, in, the, rapid, evolution, of, new, proteins, genetic, recombination, can, also, be, involved, in, dna, repair, particularly, in, the, cell, s, response, to, double, strand, breaks, the, most, common, form, of, chromosomal, crossover, is, homologous, recombination, where, the, two, chromosomes, involved, share, very, similar, sequences, non, homologous, recombination, can, be, damaging, to, cells, as, it, can, produce, chromosomal, translocations, and, genetic, abnormalities, the, recombination, reaction, is, catalyzed, by, enzymes, known, as, recombinases, such, as, rad51, the, first, step, in, recombination, is, a, double, stranded, break, caused, by, either, an, endonuclease, or, damage, to, the, dna, a, series, of, steps, catalyzed, in, part, by, the, recombinase, then, leads, to, joining, of, the, two, helices, by, at, least, one, holliday, junction, in, which, a, segment, of, a, single, strand, in, each, helix, is, annealed, to, the, complementary, strand, in, the, other, helix, the, holliday, junction, is, a, tetrahedral, junction, structure, that, can, be, moved, along, the, pair, of, chromosomes, swapping, one, strand, for, another, the, recombination, reaction, is, then, halted, by, cleavage, of, the, junction, and, re, ligation, of, the, released, dna, only, strands, of, like, polarity, exchange, dna, during, recombination, there, are, two, types, of, cleavage, east, west, cleavage, and, north, south, cleavage, the, north, south, cleavage, nicks, both, strands, of, dna, while, the, east, west, cleavage, has, one, strand, of, dna, intact, the, formation, of, a, holliday, junction, during, recombination, makes, it, possible, for, genetic, diversity, genes, to, exchange, on, chromosomes, and, expression, of, wild, type, viral, genomes, dna, contains, the, genetic, information, that, allows, all, forms, of, life, to, function, grow, and, reproduce, however, it, is, unclear, how, long, in, the, 4, billion, year, history, of, life, dna, has, performed, this, function, as, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, earliest, forms, of, life, may, have, used, rna, as, their, genetic, material, rna, may, have, acted, as, the, central, part, of, early, cell, metabolism, as, it, can, both, transmit, genetic, information, and, carry, out, catalysis, as, part, of, ribozymes, this, ancient, rna, world, where, nucleic, acid, would, have, been, used, for, both, catalysis, and, genetics, may, have, influenced, the, evolution, of, the, current, genetic, code, based, on, four, nucleotide, bases, this, would, occur, since, the, number, of, different, bases, in, such, an, organism, is, a, trade, off, between, a, small, number, of, bases, increasing, replication, accuracy, and, a, large, number, of, bases, increasing, the, catalytic, efficiency, of, ribozymes, however, there, is, no, direct, evidence, of, ancient, genetic, systems, as, recovery, of, dna, from, most, fossils, is, impossible, because, dna, survives, in, the, environment, for, less, than, one, million, years, and, slowly, degrades, into, short, fragments, in, solution, claims, for, older, dna, have, been, made, most, notably, a, report, of, the, isolation, of, a, viable, bacterium, from, a, salt, crystal, 250, million, years, old, but, these, claims, are, controversial, building, blocks, of, dna, adenine, guanine, and, related, organic, molecules, may, have, been, formed, extraterrestrially, in, outer, space, complex, dna, and, rna, organic, compounds, of, life, including, uracil, cytosine, and, thymine, have, also, been, formed, in, the, laboratory, under, conditions, mimicking, those, found, in, outer, space, using, starting, chemicals, such, as, pyrimidine, found, in, meteorites, pyrimidine, like, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, pahs, the, most, carbon, rich, chemical, found, in, the, universe, may, have, been, formed, in, red, giants, or, in, interstellar, cosmic, dust, and, gas, clouds, ancient, dna, has, been, recovered, from, ancient, organisms, at, a, timescale, where, genome, evolution, can, be, directly, observed, including, from, extinct, organisms, up, to, millions, of, years, old, such, as, the, woolly, mammoth, methods, have, been, developed, to, purify, dna, from, organisms, such, as, phenol, chloroform, extraction, and, to, manipulate, it, in, the, laboratory, such, as, restriction, digests, and, the, polymerase, chain, reaction, modern, biology, and, biochemistry, make, intensive, use, of, these, techniques, in, recombinant, dna, technology, recombinant, dna, is, a, man, made, dna, sequence, that, has, been, assembled, from, other, dna, sequences, they, can, be, transformed, into, organisms, in, the, form, of, plasmids, or, in, the, appropriate, format, by, using, a, viral, vector, the, genetically, modified, organisms, produced, can, be, used, to, produce, products, such, as, recombinant, proteins, used, in, medical, research, or, be, grown, in, agriculture, forensic, scientists, can, use, dna, in, blood, semen, skin, saliva, or, hair, found, at, a, crime, scene, to, identify, a, matching, dna, of, an, individual, such, as, a, perpetrator, this, process, is, formally, termed, dna, profiling, also, called, dna, fingerprinting, in, dna, profiling, the, lengths, of, variable, sections, of, repetitive, dna, such, as, short, tandem, repeats, and, minisatellites, are, compared, between, people, this, method, is, usually, an, extremely, reliable, technique, for, identifying, a, matching, dna, however, identification, can, be, complicated, if, the, scene, is, contaminated, with, dna, from, several, people, dna, profiling, was, developed, in, 1984, by, british, geneticist, sir, alec, jeffreys, and, first, used, in, forensic, science, to, convict, colin, pitchfork, in, the, 1988, enderby, murders, case, the, development, of, forensic, science, and, the, ability, to, now, obtain, genetic, matching, on, minute, samples, of, blood, skin, saliva, or, hair, has, led, to, re, examining, many, cases, evidence, can, now, be, uncovered, that, was, scientifically, impossible, at, the, time, of, the, original, examination, combined, with, the, removal, of, the, double, jeopardy, law, in, some, places, this, can, allow, cases, to, be, reopened, where, prior, trials, have, failed, to, produce, sufficient, evidence, to, convince, a, jury, people, charged, with, serious, crimes, may, be, required, to, provide, a, sample, of, dna, for, matching, purposes, the, most, obvious, defense, to, dna, matches, obtained, forensically, is, to, claim, that, cross, contamination, of, evidence, has, occurred, this, has, resulted, in, meticulous, strict, handling, procedures, with, new, cases, of, serious, crime, dna, profiling, is, also, used, successfully, to, positively, identify, victims, of, mass, casualty, incidents, bodies, or, body, parts, in, serious, accidents, and, individual, victims, in, mass, war, graves, via, matching, to, family, members, dna, profiling, is, also, used, in, dna, paternity, testing, to, determine, if, someone, is, the, biological, parent, or, grandparent, of, a, child, with, the, probability, of, parentage, is, typically, 99, 99, when, the, alleged, parent, is, biologically, related, to, the, child, normal, dna, sequencing, methods, happen, after, birth, but, there, are, new, methods, to, test, paternity, while, a, mother, is, still, pregnant, deoxyribozymes, also, called, dnazymes, or, catalytic, dna, were, first, discovered, in, 1994, they, are, mostly, single, stranded, dna, sequences, isolated, from, a, large, pool, of, random, dna, sequences, through, a, combinatorial, approach, called, in, vitro, selection, or, systematic, evolution, of, ligands, by, exponential, enrichment, selex, dnazymes, catalyze, variety, of, chemical, reactions, including, rna, dna, cleavage, rna, dna, ligation, amino, acids, phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, carbon, carbon, bond, formation, etc, dnazymes, can, enhance, catalytic, rate, of, chemical, reactions, up, to, 100, 000, 000, 000, fold, over, the, uncatalyzed, reaction, the, most, extensively, studied, class, of, dnazymes, is, rna, cleaving, types, which, have, been, used, to, detect, different, metal, ions, and, designing, therapeutic, agents, several, metal, specific, dnazymes, have, been, reported, including, the, gr, 5, dnazyme, lead, specific, the, ca1, 3, dnazymes, copper, specific, the, 39e, dnazyme, uranyl, specific, and, the, naa43, dnazyme, sodium, specific, the, naa43, dnazyme, which, is, reported, to, be, more, than, 10, 000, fold, selective, for, sodium, over, other, metal, ions, was, used, to, make, a, real, time, sodium, sensor, in, cells, bioinformatics, involves, the, development, of, techniques, to, store, data, mine, search, and, manipulate, biological, data, including, dna, nucleic, acid, sequence, data, these, have, led, to, widely, applied, advances, in, computer, science, especially, string, searching, algorithms, machine, learning, and, database, theory, string, searching, or, matching, algorithms, which, find, an, occurrence, of, a, sequence, of, letters, inside, a, larger, sequence, of, letters, were, developed, to, search, for, specific, sequences, of, nucleotides, the, dna, sequence, may, be, aligned, with, other, dna, sequences, to, identify, homologous, sequences, and, locate, the, specific, mutations, that, make, them, distinct, these, techniques, especially, multiple, sequence, alignment, are, used, in, studying, phylogenetic, relationships, and, protein, function, data, sets, representing, entire, genomes, worth, of, dna, sequences, such, as, those, produced, by, the, human, genome, project, are, difficult, to, use, without, the, annotations, that, identify, the, locations, of, genes, and, regulatory, elements, on, each, chromosome, regions, of, dna, sequence, that, have, the, characteristic, patterns, associated, with, protein, or, rna, coding, genes, can, be, identified, by, gene, finding, algorithms, which, allow, researchers, to, predict, the, presence, of, particular, gene, products, and, their, possible, functions, in, an, organism, even, before, they, have, been, isolated, experimentally, entire, genomes, may, also, be, compared, which, can, shed, light, on, the, evolutionary, history, of, particular, organism, and, permit, the, examination, of, complex, evolutionary, events, dna, nanotechnology, uses, the, unique, molecular, recognition, properties, of, dna, and, other, nucleic, acids, to, create, self, assembling, branched, dna, complexes, with, useful, properties, dna, is, thus, used, as, a, structural, material, rather, than, as, a, carrier, of, biological, information, this, has, led, to, the, creation, of, two, dimensional, periodic, lattices, both, tile, based, and, using, the, dna, origami, method, and, three, dimensional, structures, in, the, shapes, of, polyhedra, nanomechanical, devices, and, algorithmic, self, assembly, have, also, been, demonstrated, and, these, dna, structures, have, been, used, to, template, the, arrangement, of, other, molecules, such, as, gold, nanoparticles, and, streptavidin, proteins, dna, and, other, nucleic, acids, are, the, basis, of, aptamers, synthetic, oligonucleotide, ligands, for, specific, target, molecules, used, in, a, range, of, biotechnology, and, biomedical, applications, because, dna, collects, mutations, over, time, which, are, then, inherited, it, contains, historical, information, and, by, comparing, dna, sequences, geneticists, can, infer, the, evolutionary, history, of, organisms, their, phylogeny, this, field, of, phylogenetics, is, a, powerful, tool, in, evolutionary, biology, if, dna, sequences, within, a, species, are, compared, population, geneticists, can, learn, the, history, of, particular, populations, this, can, be, used, in, studies, ranging, from, ecological, genetics, to, anthropology, dna, as, a, storage, device, for, information, has, enormous, potential, since, it, has, much, higher, storage, density, compared, to, electronic, devices, however, high, costs, slow, read, and, write, times, memory, latency, and, insufficient, reliability, has, prevented, its, practical, use, dna, was, first, isolated, by, the, swiss, physician, friedrich, miescher, who, in, 1869, discovered, a, microscopic, substance, in, the, pus, of, discarded, surgical, bandages, as, it, resided, in, the, nuclei, of, cells, he, called, it, nuclein, in, 1878, albrecht, kossel, isolated, the, non, protein, component, of, nuclein, nucleic, acid, and, later, isolated, its, five, primary, nucleobases, in, 1909, phoebus, levene, identified, the, base, sugar, and, phosphate, nucleotide, unit, of, rna, then, named, yeast, nucleic, acid, in, 1929, levene, identified, deoxyribose, sugar, in, thymus, nucleic, acid, dna, levene, suggested, that, dna, consisted, of, a, string, of, four, nucleotide, units, linked, together, through, the, phosphate, groups, tetranucleotide, hypothesis, levene, thought, the, chain, was, short, and, the, bases, repeated, in, a, fixed, order, in, 1927, nikolai, koltsov, proposed, that, inherited, traits, would, be, inherited, via, a, giant, hereditary, molecule, made, up, of, two, mirror, strands, that, would, replicate, in, a, semi, conservative, fashion, using, each, strand, as, a, template, in, 1928, frederick, griffith, in, his, experiment, discovered, that, traits, of, the, smooth, form, of, pneumococcus, could, be, transferred, to, the, rough, form, of, the, same, bacteria, by, mixing, killed, smooth, bacteria, with, the, live, rough, form, this, system, provided, the, first, clear, suggestion, that, dna, carries, genetic, information, in, 1933, while, studying, virgin, sea, urchin, eggs, jean, brachet, suggested, that, dna, is, found, in, the, cell, nucleus, and, that, rna, is, present, exclusively, in, the, cytoplasm, at, the, time, yeast, nucleic, acid, rna, was, thought, to, occur, only, in, plants, while, thymus, nucleic, acid, dna, only, in, animals, the, latter, was, thought, to, be, a, tetramer, with, the, function, of, buffering, cellular, ph, in, 1937, william, astbury, produced, the, first, x, ray, diffraction, patterns, that, showed, that, dna, had, a, regular, structure, in, 1943, oswald, avery, along, with, co, workers, colin, macleod, and, maclyn, mccarty, identified, dna, as, the, transforming, principle, supporting, griffith, s, suggestion, avery, macleod, mccarty, experiment, erwin, chargaff, developed, and, published, observations, now, known, as, chargaff, s, rules, stating, that, in, dna, from, any, species, of, any, organism, the, amount, of, guanine, should, be, equal, to, cytosine, and, the, amount, of, adenine, should, be, equal, to, thymine, late, in, 1951, francis, crick, started, working, with, james, watson, at, the, cavendish, laboratory, within, the, university, of, cambridge, dna, s, role, in, heredity, was, confirmed, in, 1952, when, alfred, hershey, and, martha, chase, in, the, hershey, chase, experiment, showed, that, dna, is, the, genetic, material, of, the, enterobacteria, phage, t2, in, may, 1952, raymond, gosling, a, graduate, student, working, under, the, supervision, of, rosalind, franklin, took, an, x, ray, diffraction, image, labeled, as, photo, 51, at, high, hydration, levels, of, dna, this, photo, was, given, to, watson, and, crick, by, maurice, wilkins, and, was, critical, to, their, obtaining, the, correct, structure, of, dna, franklin, told, crick, and, watson, that, the, backbones, had, to, be, on, the, outside, before, then, linus, pauling, and, watson, and, crick, had, erroneous, models, with, the, chains, inside, and, the, bases, pointing, outwards, franklin, s, identification, of, the, space, group, for, dna, crystals, revealed, to, crick, that, the, two, dna, strands, were, antiparallel, in, february, 1953, linus, pauling, and, robert, corey, proposed, a, model, for, nucleic, acids, containing, three, intertwined, chains, with, the, phosphates, near, the, axis, and, the, bases, on, the, outside, watson, and, crick, completed, their, model, which, is, now, accepted, as, the, first, correct, model, of, the, double, helix, of, dna, on, 28, february, 1953, crick, interrupted, patrons, lunchtime, at, the, eagle, pub, in, cambridge, england, to, announce, that, he, and, watson, had, discovered, the, secret, of, life, the, 25, april, 1953, issue, of, the, journal, nature, published, a, series, of, five, articles, giving, the, watson, and, crick, double, helix, structure, dna, and, evidence, supporting, it, the, structure, was, reported, in, a, letter, titled, molecular, structure, of, nucleic, acids, a, structure, for, deoxyribose, nucleic, acid, in, which, they, said, it, has, not, escaped, our, notice, that, the, specific, pairing, we, have, postulated, immediately, suggests, a, possible, copying, mechanism, for, the, genetic, material, this, letter, was, followed, by, a, letter, from, franklin, and, gosling, which, was, the, first, publication, of, their, own, x, ray, diffraction, data, and, of, their, original, analysis, method, then, followed, a, letter, by, wilkins, and, two, of, his, colleagues, which, contained, an, analysis, of, in, vivo, b, dna, x, ray, patterns, and, which, supported, the, presence, in, vivo, of, the, watson, and, crick, structure, in, april, 2023, scientists, based, on, new, evidence, concluded, that, rosalind, franklin, was, a, contributor, and, equal, player, in, the, discovery, process, of, dna, rather, than, otherwise, as, may, have, been, presented, subsequently, after, the, time, of, the, discovery, in, 1962, after, franklin, s, death, watson, crick, and, wilkins, jointly, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, nobel, prizes, are, awarded, only, to, living, recipients, a, debate, continues, about, who, should, receive, credit, for, the, discovery, in, an, influential, presentation, in, 1957, crick, laid, out, the, central, dogma, of, molecular, biology, which, foretold, the, relationship, between, dna, rna, and, proteins, and, articulated, the, adaptor, hypothesis, final, confirmation, of, the, replication, mechanism, that, was, implied, by, the, double, helical, structure, followed, in, 1958, through, the, meselson, stahl, experiment, further, work, by, crick, and, co, workers, showed, that, the, genetic, code, was, based, on, non, overlapping, triplets, of, bases, called, codons, allowing, har, gobind, khorana, robert, w, holley, and, marshall, warren, nirenberg, to, decipher, the, genetic, code, these, findings, represent, the, birth, of, molecular, biology, in, 1986, dna, analysis, was, first, used, for, criminal, investigative, purposes, when, police, in, the, uk, requested, alec, jeffreys, of, the, university, of, leicester, to, verify, or, disprove, a, suspect, s, rape, murder, confession, in, this, particular, case, the, suspect, had, confessed, to, two, rape, murders, but, had, later, retracted, his, confession, dna, testing, at, the, university, labs, soon, disproved, the, veracity, of, the, suspect, s, original, confession, and, the, suspect, was, exonerated, from, the, murder, rape, charges
