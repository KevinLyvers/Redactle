melanin, m, l, n, n, from, ancient, greek, m, las, black, dark, is, a, family, of, biomolecules, organized, as, oligomers, or, polymers, which, among, other, functions, provide, the, pigments, of, many, organisms, melanin, pigments, are, produced, in, a, specialized, group, of, cells, known, as, melanocytes, there, are, five, basic, types, of, melanin, eumelanin, pheomelanin, neuromelanin, allomelanin, and, pyomelanin, eumelanin, is, produced, through, a, multistage, chemical, process, known, as, melanogenesis, where, the, oxidation, of, the, amino, acid, tyrosine, is, followed, by, polymerization, eumelanin, is, the, most, common, type, pheomelanin, which, is, produced, when, melanocytes, are, malfunctioning, due, to, derivation, of, the, gene, to, its, recessive, format, is, a, cysteine, derivative, that, contains, poly, benzothiazine, portions, that, are, largely, responsible, for, the, red, or, yellow, tint, given, to, some, skin, or, hair, colors, neuromelanin, is, found, in, the, brain, research, has, been, undertaken, to, investigate, its, efficacy, in, treating, neurodegenerative, disorders, such, as, parkinson, s, allomelanin, and, pyomelanin, are, two, types, of, nitrogen, free, melanin, in, the, human, skin, melanogenesis, is, initiated, by, exposure, to, uv, radiation, causing, the, skin, to, darken, eumelanin, is, an, effective, absorbent, of, light, the, pigment, is, able, to, dissipate, over, 99, 9, of, absorbed, uv, radiation, because, of, this, property, eumelanin, is, thought, to, protect, skin, cells, from, uva, and, uvb, radiation, damage, reducing, the, risk, of, folate, depletion, and, dermal, degradation, exposure, to, uv, radiation, is, associated, with, increased, risk, of, malignant, melanoma, a, cancer, of, melanocytes, melanin, cells, studies, have, shown, a, lower, incidence, for, skin, cancer, in, individuals, with, more, concentrated, melanin, i, e, darker, skin, tone, eumelanin, has, two, forms, linked, to, 5, 6, dihydroxyindole, dhi, and, 5, 6, dihydroxyindole, 2, carboxylic, acid, dhica, dhi, derived, eumelanin, is, dark, brown, or, black, and, insoluble, and, dhica, derived, eumelanin, which, is, lighter, and, soluble, in, alkali, both, eumelanins, arise, from, the, oxidation, of, tyrosine, in, specialized, organelles, called, melanosomes, this, reaction, is, catalyzed, by, the, enzyme, tyrosinase, the, initial, product, dopaquinone, can, transform, into, either, 5, 6, dihydroxyindole, dhi, or, 5, 6, dihydroxyindole, 2, carboxylic, acid, dhica, dhi, and, dhica, are, oxidized, and, then, polymerize, to, form, the, two, eumelanins, in, natural, conditions, dhi, and, dhica, often, co, polymerize, resulting, in, a, range, of, eumelanin, polymers, these, polymers, contribute, to, the, variety, of, melanin, components, in, human, skin, and, hair, ranging, from, light, yellow, red, pheomelanin, to, light, brown, dhica, enriched, eumelanin, and, dark, brown, or, black, dhi, enriched, eumelanin, these, final, polymers, differ, in, solubility, and, color, analysis, of, highly, pigmented, fitzpatrick, type, v, and, vi, skin, finds, that, dhi, eumelanin, comprises, the, largest, portion, approximately, 60, 70, followed, by, dhica, eumelanin, at, 25, 35, and, pheomelanin, only, 2, 8, notably, while, an, enrichment, of, dhi, eumelanin, occurs, in, during, sun, tanning, it, is, accompanied, by, a, decrease, in, dhica, eumelanin, and, pheomelanin, a, small, amount, of, black, eumelanin, in, the, absence, of, other, pigments, causes, grey, hair, a, small, amount, of, eumelanin, in, the, absence, of, other, pigments, causes, blond, hair, eumelanin, is, present, in, the, skin, and, hair, etc, pheomelanins, or, phaeomelanins, impart, a, range, of, yellowish, to, reddish, colors, pheomelanins, are, particularly, concentrated, in, the, lips, nipples, glans, of, the, penis, and, vagina, when, a, small, amount, of, eumelanin, in, hair, which, would, otherwise, cause, blond, hair, is, mixed, with, pheomelanin, the, result, is, orange, hair, which, is, typically, called, red, or, ginger, hair, pheomelanin, is, also, present, in, the, skin, and, redheads, consequently, often, have, a, more, pinkish, hue, to, their, skin, as, well, exposure, of, the, skin, to, ultraviolet, light, increases, pheomelanin, content, as, it, does, for, eumelanin, but, rather, than, absorbing, light, pheomelanin, within, the, hair, and, skin, reflect, yellow, to, red, light, which, may, increase, damage, from, uv, radiation, exposure, pheomelanin, production, is, highly, dependent, on, cysteine, availability, which, is, transported, into, the, melanosome, reacting, with, dopaquinone, to, form, cys, dopa, cys, dopa, then, undergoes, several, transformations, before, forming, pheomelanin, in, chemical, terms, pheomelanins, differ, from, eumelanins, in, that, the, oligomer, structure, incorporates, benzothiazine, and, benzothiazole, units, that, are, produced, instead, of, dhi, and, dhica, when, the, amino, acid, l, cysteine, is, present, neuromelanin, nm, is, an, insoluble, polymer, pigment, produced, in, specific, populations, of, catecholaminergic, neurons, in, the, brain, humans, have, the, largest, amount, of, nm, which, is, present, in, lesser, amounts, in, other, primates, and, totally, absent, in, many, other, species, the, biological, function, remains, unknown, although, human, nm, has, been, shown, to, efficiently, bind, transition, metals, such, as, iron, as, well, as, other, potentially, toxic, molecules, therefore, it, may, play, crucial, roles, in, apoptosis, and, the, related, parkinson, s, disease, up, until, the, 1960s, melanin, was, classified, into, eumelanin, and, pheomelanin, however, in, 1955, a, melanin, associated, with, nerve, cells, was, discovered, neuromelanin, in, 1972, a, water, soluble, form, pyomelanin, was, discovered, in, 1976, allomelanin, the, fifth, form, of, the, melanins, was, found, in, nature, peptidomelanin, is, another, water, soluble, form, of, melanin, it, was, found, to, be, secreted, into, the, surrounding, medium, by, germinating, aspergillus, niger, strain, melanoliber, spores, peptidomelanin, is, formed, as, a, copolymer, between, l, dopa, eumelanin, and, short, peptides, that, form, a, corona, that, are, responsible, for, the, substance, s, solubility, the, peptide, chains, are, linked, to, the, l, dopa, core, polymer, via, peptide, bonds, this, lead, to, a, proposed, biosynthetic, process, involving, the, hydroxylation, of, tyrosinylated, peptides, formed, via, proteases, during, sporogenesis, which, are, then, incorporated, autoxidatively, into, a, growing, l, dopa, core, polymer, it, is, possible, to, enrich, melanin, with, selenium, instead, of, sulphur, this, selenium, analogue, of, pheomelanin, has, been, successfully, synthesized, through, chemical, and, biosynthetic, routes, using, selenocystine, as, a, feedstock, due, to, selenium, s, higher, atomic, number, the, obtained, selenomelanin, can, be, expected, to, provide, better, protection, against, ionising, radiation, as, compared, to, the, other, known, forms, of, melanin, this, protection, has, been, demonstrated, with, radiation, experiments, on, human, cells, and, bacteria, opening, up, the, possibility, of, applications, in, space, travel, trichochromes, formerly, called, trichosiderins, are, pigments, produced, from, the, same, metabolic, pathway, as, the, eumelanins, and, pheomelanins, but, unlike, those, molecules, they, have, low, molecular, weight, they, occur, in, some, red, human, hair, in, humans, melanin, is, the, primary, determinant, of, skin, color, it, is, also, found, in, hair, the, pigmented, tissue, underlying, the, iris, of, the, eye, and, the, stria, vascularis, of, the, inner, ear, in, the, brain, tissues, with, melanin, include, the, medulla, and, pigment, bearing, neurons, within, areas, of, the, brainstem, such, as, the, locus, coeruleus, it, also, occurs, in, the, zona, reticularis, of, the, adrenal, gland, the, melanin, in, the, skin, is, produced, by, melanocytes, which, are, found, in, the, basal, layer, of, the, epidermis, although, in, general, human, beings, possess, a, similar, concentration, of, melanocytes, in, their, skin, the, melanocytes, in, some, individuals, and, ethnic, groups, produce, variable, amounts, of, melanin, the, ratio, of, eumelanin, 74, and, pheomelanin, 26, in, the, epidermis, is, constant, regardless, of, the, degree, of, pigmentation, some, humans, have, very, little, or, no, melanin, synthesis, in, their, bodies, a, condition, known, as, albinism, because, melanin, is, an, aggregate, of, smaller, component, molecules, there, are, many, different, types, of, melanin, with, different, proportions, and, bonding, patterns, of, these, component, molecules, both, pheomelanin, and, eumelanin, are, found, in, human, skin, and, hair, but, eumelanin, is, the, most, abundant, melanin, in, humans, as, well, as, the, form, most, likely, to, be, deficient, in, albinism, melanins, have, very, diverse, roles, and, functions, in, various, organisms, a, form, of, melanin, makes, up, the, ink, used, by, many, cephalopods, see, cephalopod, ink, as, a, defense, mechanism, against, predators, melanins, also, protect, microorganisms, such, as, bacteria, and, fungi, against, stresses, that, involve, cell, damage, such, as, uv, radiation, from, the, sun, and, reactive, oxygen, species, melanin, also, protects, against, damage, from, high, temperatures, chemical, stresses, such, as, heavy, metals, and, oxidizing, agents, and, biochemical, threats, such, as, host, defenses, against, invading, microbes, therefore, in, many, pathogenic, microbes, for, example, in, cryptococcus, neoformans, a, fungus, melanins, appear, to, play, important, roles, in, virulence, and, pathogenicity, by, protecting, the, microbe, against, immune, responses, of, its, host, in, invertebrates, a, major, aspect, of, the, innate, immune, defense, system, against, invading, pathogens, involves, melanin, within, minutes, after, infection, the, microbe, is, encapsulated, within, melanin, melanization, and, the, generation, of, free, radical, byproducts, during, the, formation, of, this, capsule, is, thought, to, aid, in, killing, them, some, types, of, fungi, called, radiotrophic, fungi, appear, to, be, able, to, use, melanin, as, a, photosynthetic, pigment, that, enables, them, to, capture, gamma, rays, and, harness, this, energy, for, growth, in, fish, melanin, occurs, not, only, in, the, skin, but, also, in, internal, organs, such, as, eyes, most, fish, species, use, eumelanin, but, stegastes, apicalis, and, cyprinus, carpio, use, pheomelanin, instead, the, darker, feathers, of, birds, owe, their, color, to, melanin, and, are, less, readily, degraded, by, bacteria, than, unpigmented, ones, or, those, containing, carotenoid, pigments, feathers, that, contain, melanin, are, also, 39, more, resistant, to, abrasion, than, those, that, do, not, because, melanin, granules, help, fill, the, space, between, the, keratin, strands, that, form, feathers, pheomelanin, synthesis, in, birds, implies, the, consumption, of, cysteine, a, semi, essential, amino, acid, that, is, necessary, for, the, synthesis, of, the, antioxidant, glutathione, gsh, but, that, may, be, toxic, if, in, excess, in, the, diet, indeed, many, carnivorous, birds, which, have, a, high, protein, content, in, their, diet, exhibit, pheomelanin, based, coloration, melanin, is, also, important, in, mammalian, pigmentation, the, coat, pattern, of, mammals, is, determined, by, the, agouti, gene, which, regulates, the, distribution, of, melanin, the, mechanisms, of, the, gene, have, been, extensively, studied, in, mice, to, provide, an, insight, into, the, diversity, of, mammalian, coat, patterns, melanin, in, arthropods, has, been, observed, to, be, deposited, in, layers, thus, producing, a, bragg, reflector, of, alternating, refractive, index, when, the, scale, of, this, pattern, matches, the, wavelength, of, visible, light, structural, coloration, arises, giving, a, number, of, species, an, iridescent, color, arachnids, are, one, of, the, few, groups, in, which, melanin, has, not, been, easily, detected, though, researchers, found, data, suggesting, spiders, do, in, fact, produce, melanin, some, moth, species, including, the, wood, tiger, moth, convert, resources, to, melanin, to, enhance, their, thermoregulation, as, the, wood, tiger, moth, has, populations, over, a, large, range, of, latitudes, it, has, been, observed, that, more, northern, populations, showed, higher, rates, of, melanization, in, both, yellow, and, white, male, phenotypes, of, the, wood, tiger, moth, individuals, with, more, melanin, had, a, heightened, ability, to, trap, heat, but, an, increased, predation, rate, due, to, a, weaker, and, less, effective, aposematic, signal, melanin, protects, drosophila, flies, and, mice, against, dna, damage, from, non, uv, radiation, important, studies, in, drosophila, models, include, hopwood, et, al, 1985, much, of, our, understanding, of, the, radioprotective, effects, of, melanin, against, gamma, radiation, come, from, the, laboratories, and, research, groups, of, irma, mosse, 1151, mosse, began, in, radiobiology, in, the, soviet, era, was, increasingly, supported, by, government, funding, in, the, wake, of, the, discovery, of, radiotrophic, microbes, in, chernobyl, and, as, of, 2022, continues, under, the, belarusian, institute, of, genetics, and, cytology, her, most, significant, contribution, is, mosse, et, al, 2000, on, mice, 1151, but, also, includes, mosse, et, al, 1994, mosse, et, al, 1997, mosse, et, al, 1998, mosse, et, al, 2001, mosse, et, al, 2002, mosse, et, al, 2006, mosse, et, al, 2007, and, mosse, et, al, 2008, melanin, produced, by, plants, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, catechol, melanins, as, they, can, yield, catechol, on, alkali, fusion, it, is, commonly, seen, in, the, enzymatic, browning, of, fruits, such, as, bananas, chestnut, shell, melanin, can, be, used, as, an, antioxidant, and, coloring, agent, biosynthesis, involves, the, oxidation, of, indole, 5, 6, quinone, by, the, tyrosinase, type, polyphenol, oxidase, from, tyrosine, and, catecholamines, leading, to, the, formation, of, catechol, melanin, despite, this, many, plants, contain, compounds, which, inhibit, the, production, of, melanins, it, is, now, understood, that, melanins, do, not, have, a, single, structure, or, stoichiometry, nonetheless, chemical, databases, such, as, pubchem, include, structural, and, empirical, formulae, typically, 3, 8, dimethyl, 2, 7, dihydrobenzo, diindole, 4, 5, 9, 10, tetrone, this, can, be, thought, of, as, a, single, monomer, that, accounts, for, the, measured, elemental, composition, and, some, properties, of, melanin, but, is, unlikely, to, be, found, in, nature, solano, claims, that, this, misleading, trend, stems, from, a, report, of, an, empirical, formula, in, 1948, but, provides, no, other, historical, detail, the, first, step, of, the, biosynthetic, pathway, for, both, eumelanins, and, pheomelanins, is, catalysed, by, tyrosinase, dopaquinone, can, combine, with, cysteine, by, two, pathways, to, benzothiazines, and, pheomelanins, also, dopaquinone, can, be, converted, to, leucodopachrome, and, follow, two, more, pathways, to, the, eumelanins, detailed, metabolic, pathways, can, be, found, in, the, kegg, database, see, external, links, melanin, is, brown, non, refractile, and, finely, granular, with, individual, granules, having, a, diameter, of, less, than, 800, nanometers, this, differentiates, melanin, from, common, blood, breakdown, pigments, which, are, larger, chunky, and, refractile, and, range, in, color, from, green, to, yellow, or, red, brown, in, heavily, pigmented, lesions, dense, aggregates, of, melanin, can, obscure, histologic, detail, a, dilute, solution, of, potassium, permanganate, is, an, effective, melanin, bleach, there, are, approximately, nine, types, of, oculocutaneous, albinism, which, is, mostly, an, autosomal, recessive, disorder, certain, ethnicities, have, higher, incidences, of, different, forms, for, example, the, most, common, type, called, oculocutaneous, albinism, type, 2, oca2, is, especially, frequent, among, people, of, black, african, descent, and, white, europeans, people, with, oca2, usually, have, fair, skin, but, are, often, not, as, pale, as, oca1, they, oca2, or, oca1, see, comments, in, history, have, pale, blonde, to, golden, strawberry, blonde, or, even, brown, hair, and, most, commonly, blue, eyes, 98, 7, 100, of, modern, europeans, are, carriers, of, the, derived, allele, slc24a5, a, known, cause, of, nonsyndromic, oculocutaneous, albinism, it, is, an, autosomal, recessive, disorder, characterized, by, a, congenital, reduction, or, absence, of, melanin, pigment, in, the, skin, hair, and, eyes, the, estimated, frequency, of, oca2, among, african, americans, is, 1, in, 10, 000, which, contrasts, with, a, frequency, of, 1, in, 36, 000, in, white, americans, in, some, african, nations, the, frequency, of, the, disorder, is, even, higher, ranging, from, 1, in, 2, 000, to, 1, in, 5, 000, another, form, of, albinism, the, yellow, oculocutaneous, albinism, appears, to, be, more, prevalent, among, the, amish, who, are, of, primarily, swiss, and, german, ancestry, people, with, this, ib, variant, of, the, disorder, commonly, have, white, hair, and, skin, at, birth, but, rapidly, develop, normal, skin, pigmentation, in, infancy, ocular, albinism, affects, not, only, eye, pigmentation, but, visual, acuity, as, well, people, with, albinism, typically, test, poorly, within, the, 20, 60, to, 20, 400, range, in, addition, two, forms, of, albinism, with, approximately, 1, in, 2, 700, most, prevalent, among, people, of, puerto, rican, origin, are, associated, with, mortality, beyond, melanoma, related, deaths, the, connection, between, albinism, and, deafness, is, well, known, though, poorly, understood, in, his, 1859, treatise, on, the, origin, of, species, charles, darwin, observed, that, cats, which, are, entirely, white, and, have, blue, eyes, are, generally, deaf, in, humans, hypopigmentation, and, deafness, occur, together, in, the, rare, waardenburg, s, syndrome, predominantly, observed, among, the, hopi, in, north, america, the, incidence, of, albinism, in, hopi, indians, has, been, estimated, as, approximately, 1, in, 200, individuals, similar, patterns, of, albinism, and, deafness, have, been, found, in, other, mammals, including, dogs, and, rodents, however, a, lack, of, melanin, per, se, does, not, appear, to, be, directly, responsible, for, deafness, associated, with, hypopigmentation, as, most, individuals, lacking, the, enzymes, required, to, synthesize, melanin, have, normal, auditory, function, instead, the, absence, of, melanocytes, in, the, stria, vascularis, of, the, inner, ear, results, in, cochlear, impairment, though, the, reasons, for, this, are, not, fully, understood, in, parkinson, s, disease, a, disorder, that, affects, neuromotor, functioning, there, is, decreased, neuromelanin, in, the, substantia, nigra, and, locus, coeruleus, as, a, consequence, of, specific, dropping, out, of, dopaminergic, and, noradrenergic, pigmented, neurons, this, results, in, diminished, dopamine, and, norepinephrine, synthesis, while, no, correlation, between, race, and, the, level, of, neuromelanin, in, the, substantia, nigra, has, been, reported, the, significantly, lower, incidence, of, parkinson, s, in, blacks, than, in, whites, has, prompt, some, to, suggest, that, cutaneous, melanin, might, somehow, serve, to, protect, the, neuromelanin, in, substantia, nigra, from, external, toxins, in, addition, to, melanin, deficiency, the, molecular, weight, of, the, melanin, polymer, may, be, decreased, by, various, factors, such, as, oxidative, stress, exposure, to, light, perturbation, in, its, association, with, melanosomal, matrix, proteins, changes, in, ph, or, in, local, concentrations, of, metal, ions, a, decreased, molecular, weight, or, a, decrease, in, the, degree, of, polymerization, of, ocular, melanin, has, been, proposed, to, turn, the, normally, anti, oxidant, polymer, into, a, pro, oxidant, in, its, pro, oxidant, state, melanin, has, been, suggested, to, be, involved, in, the, causation, and, progression, of, macular, degeneration, and, melanoma, rasagiline, an, important, monotherapy, drug, in, parkinson, s, disease, has, melanin, binding, properties, and, melanoma, tumor, reducing, properties, higher, eumelanin, levels, also, can, be, a, disadvantage, however, beyond, a, higher, disposition, toward, vitamin, d, deficiency, dark, skin, is, a, complicating, factor, in, the, laser, removal, of, port, wine, stains, effective, in, treating, white, skin, in, general, lasers, are, less, successful, in, removing, port, wine, stains, in, people, of, asian, or, african, descent, higher, concentrations, of, melanin, in, darker, skinned, individuals, simply, diffuse, and, absorb, the, laser, radiation, inhibiting, light, absorption, by, the, targeted, tissue, in, a, similar, manner, melanin, can, complicate, laser, treatment, of, other, dermatological, conditions, in, people, with, darker, skin, freckles, and, moles, are, formed, where, there, is, a, localized, concentration, of, melanin, in, the, skin, they, are, highly, associated, with, pale, skin, nicotine, has, an, affinity, for, melanin, containing, tissues, because, of, its, precursor, function, in, melanin, synthesis, or, its, irreversible, binding, of, melanin, this, has, been, suggested, to, underlie, the, increased, nicotine, dependence, and, lower, smoking, cessation, rates, in, darker, pigmented, individuals, melanocytes, insert, granules, of, melanin, into, specialized, cellular, vesicles, called, melanosomes, these, are, then, transferred, into, the, keratinocyte, cells, of, the, human, epidermis, the, melanosomes, in, each, recipient, cell, accumulate, atop, the, cell, nucleus, where, they, protect, the, nuclear, dna, from, mutations, caused, by, the, ionizing, radiation, of, the, sun, s, ultraviolet, rays, in, general, people, whose, ancestors, lived, for, long, periods, in, the, regions, of, the, globe, near, the, equator, have, larger, quantities, of, eumelanin, in, their, skins, this, makes, their, skins, brown, or, black, and, protects, them, against, high, levels, of, exposure, to, the, sun, which, more, frequently, result, in, melanomas, in, lighter, skinned, people, not, all, the, effects, of, pigmentation, are, advantageous, pigmentation, increases, the, heat, load, in, hot, climates, and, dark, skinned, people, absorb, 30, more, heat, from, sunlight, than, do, very, light, skinned, people, although, this, factor, may, be, offset, by, more, profuse, sweating, in, cold, climates, dark, skin, entails, more, heat, loss, by, radiation, pigmentation, also, hinders, synthesis, of, vitamin, d, since, pigmentation, appears, to, be, not, entirely, advantageous, to, life, in, the, tropics, other, hypotheses, about, its, biological, significance, have, been, advanced, for, example, a, secondary, phenomenon, induced, by, adaptation, to, parasites, and, tropical, diseases, early, humans, evolved, dark, skin, color, as, an, adaptation, to, a, loss, of, body, hair, that, increased, the, effects, of, uv, radiation, before, the, development, of, hairlessness, early, humans, might, have, had, light, skin, underneath, their, fur, similar, to, that, found, in, other, primates, anatomically, modern, humans, evolved, in, africa, between, 200, 000, and, 100, 000, years, ago, and, then, populated, the, rest, of, the, world, through, migration, between, 80, 000, and, 50, 000, years, ago, in, some, areas, interbreeding, with, certain, archaic, human, species, neanderthals, denisovans, and, possibly, others, the, first, modern, humans, had, darker, skin, as, the, indigenous, people, of, africa, today, following, migration, and, settlement, in, asia, and, europe, the, selective, pressure, dark, uv, radiation, protecting, skin, decreased, where, radiation, from, the, sun, was, less, intense, this, resulted, in, the, current, range, of, human, skin, color, of, the, two, common, gene, variants, known, to, be, associated, with, pale, human, skin, mc1r, does, not, appear, to, have, undergone, positive, selection, while, slc24a5, has, undergone, positive, selection, as, with, peoples, having, migrated, northward, those, with, light, skin, migrating, toward, the, equator, acclimatize, to, the, much, stronger, solar, radiation, nature, selects, for, less, melanin, when, ultraviolet, radiation, is, weak, most, people, s, skin, darkens, when, exposed, to, uv, light, giving, them, more, protection, when, it, is, needed, this, is, the, physiological, purpose, of, sun, tanning, dark, skinned, people, who, produce, more, skin, protecting, eumelanin, have, a, greater, protection, against, sunburn, and, the, development, of, melanoma, a, potentially, deadly, form, of, skin, cancer, as, well, as, other, health, problems, related, to, exposure, to, strong, solar, radiation, including, the, photodegradation, of, certain, vitamins, such, as, riboflavins, carotenoids, tocopherol, and, folate, melanin, in, the, eyes, in, the, iris, and, choroid, helps, protect, from, ultraviolet, and, high, frequency, visible, light, people, with, blue, green, and, grey, eyes, are, more, at, risk, of, sun, related, eye, problems, furthermore, the, ocular, lens, yellows, with, age, providing, added, protection, however, the, lens, also, becomes, more, rigid, with, age, losing, most, of, its, accommodation, the, ability, to, change, shape, to, focus, from, far, to, near, a, detriment, due, probably, to, protein, crosslinking, caused, by, uv, exposure, recent, research, suggests, that, melanin, may, serve, a, protective, role, other, than, photoprotection, melanin, is, able, to, effectively, chelate, metal, ions, through, its, carboxylate, and, phenolic, hydroxyl, groups, often, much, more, efficiently, than, the, powerful, chelating, ligand, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, edta, thus, it, may, serve, to, sequester, potentially, toxic, metal, ions, protecting, the, rest, of, the, cell, this, hypothesis, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, the, loss, of, neuromelanin, observed, in, parkinson, s, disease, is, accompanied, by, an, increase, in, iron, levels, in, the, brain, evidence, exists, for, a, highly, cross, linked, heteropolymer, bound, covalently, to, matrix, scaffolding, melanoproteins, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, ability, of, melanin, to, act, as, an, antioxidant, is, directly, proportional, to, its, degree, of, polymerization, or, molecular, weight, suboptimal, conditions, for, the, effective, polymerization, of, melanin, monomers, may, lead, to, formation, of, pro, oxidant, melanin, with, lower, molecular, weight, implicated, in, the, causation, and, progression, of, macular, degeneration, and, melanoma, signaling, pathways, that, upregulate, melanization, in, the, retinal, pigment, epithelium, rpe, also, may, be, implicated, in, the, downregulation, of, rod, outer, segment, phagocytosis, by, the, rpe, this, phenomenon, has, been, attributed, in, part, to, foveal, sparing, in, macular, degeneration, heavily, pigmented, melanoma, cells, have, a, young, s, modulus, of, about, 4, 93, kpa, compared, to, non, pigmented, cells, with, a, value, of, 0, 98, kpa, the, elasticity, of, melanoma, cells, is, crucial, to, metastasis, and, growth, non, pigmented, tumors, were, larger, than, pigmented, tumors, and, spread, far, more, easily, pigmented, and, non, pigmented, cells, are, both, present, in, melanoma, tumors, so, that, they, can, both, be, drug, resistant, and, metastatic, see, template, leucine, metabolism, in, humans, this, diagram, does, not, include, the, pathway,
