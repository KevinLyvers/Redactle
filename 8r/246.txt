longevity, may, refer, to, especially, long, lived, members, of, a, population, whereas, life, expectancy, is, defined, statistically, as, the, average, number, of, years, remaining, at, a, given, age, for, example, a, population, s, life, expectancy, at, birth, is, the, same, as, the, average, age, at, death, for, all, people, born, in, the, same, year, in, the, case, of, cohorts, longevity, studies, may, involve, putative, methods, to, extend, life, longevity, has, been, a, topic, not, only, for, the, scientific, community, but, also, for, writers, of, travel, science, fiction, and, utopian, novels, the, legendary, fountain, of, youth, appeared, in, the, work, of, the, ancient, greek, historian, herodotus, there, are, difficulties, in, authenticating, the, longest, human, life, span, owing, to, inaccurate, or, incomplete, birth, statistics, fiction, legend, and, folklore, have, proposed, or, claimed, life, spans, in, the, past, or, future, vastly, longer, than, those, verified, by, modern, standards, and, longevity, narratives, and, unverified, longevity, claims, frequently, speak, of, their, existence, in, the, present, a, life, annuity, is, a, form, of, longevity, insurance, various, factors, contribute, to, an, individual, s, longevity, significant, factors, in, life, expectancy, include, gender, genetics, access, to, health, care, hygiene, diet, and, nutrition, exercise, lifestyle, and, crime, rates, below, is, a, list, of, life, expectancies, in, different, types, of, countries, population, longevities, are, increasing, as, life, expectancies, around, the, world, grow, the, gerontology, research, group, validates, current, longevity, records, by, modern, standards, and, maintains, a, list, of, supercentenarians, many, other, unvalidated, longevity, claims, exist, record, holding, individuals, include, evidence, based, studies, indicate, that, longevity, is, based, on, two, major, factors, genetics, and, lifestyle, twin, studies, have, estimated, that, approximately, 20, 30, of, the, variation, in, human, lifespan, can, be, related, to, genetics, with, the, rest, due, to, individual, behaviors, and, environmental, factors, which, can, be, modified, although, over, 200, gene, variants, have, been, associated, with, longevity, according, to, a, us, belgian, uk, research, database, of, human, genetic, variants, these, explain, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, heritability, lymphoblastoid, cell, lines, established, from, blood, samples, of, centenarians, have, significantly, higher, activity, of, the, dna, repair, protein, parp, poly, adp, ribose, polymerase, than, cell, lines, from, younger, 20, to, 70, year, old, individuals, the, lymphocytic, cells, of, centenarians, have, characteristics, typical, of, cells, from, young, people, both, in, their, capability, of, priming, the, mechanism, of, repair, after, h, 2, o, 2, sublethal, oxidative, dna, damage, and, in, their, parp, gene, expression, these, findings, suggest, that, elevated, parp, gene, expression, contributes, to, the, longevity, of, centenarians, consistent, with, the, dna, damage, theory, of, aging, in, july, 2020, scientists, used, public, biological, data, on, 1, 75, m, people, with, known, lifespans, overall, and, identified, 10, genomic, loci, which, appear, to, intrinsically, influence, healthspan, lifespan, and, longevity, of, which, half, have, not, been, reported, previously, at, genome, wide, significance, and, most, being, associated, with, cardiovascular, disease, and, identified, haem, metabolism, as, a, promising, candidate, for, further, research, within, the, field, their, study, suggests, that, high, levels, of, iron, in, the, blood, likely, reduce, and, genes, involved, in, metabolising, iron, likely, increase, healthy, years, of, life, in, humans, longevity, is, a, highly, plastic, trait, and, traits, that, influence, its, components, respond, to, physical, static, environments, and, to, wide, ranging, life, style, changes, physical, exercise, dietary, habits, living, conditions, and, pharmaceutical, as, well, as, nutritional, interventions, a, 2012, study, found, that, even, modest, amounts, of, leisure, time, physical, exercise, can, extend, life, expectancy, by, as, much, as, 4, 5, years, as, of, 2021, there, is, no, clinical, evidence, that, any, dietary, practice, contributes, to, human, longevity, four, well, studied, biological, pathways, that, are, known, to, regulate, aging, and, whose, modulation, has, been, shown, to, influence, longevity, are, insulin, igf, 1, mechanistic, target, of, rapamycin, mtor, amp, activating, protein, kinase, ampk, and, sirtuin, pathways, autophagy, plays, a, pivotal, role, in, healthspan, and, lifespan, extension, in, preindustrial, times, deaths, at, young, and, middle, age, were, more, common, than, they, are, today, this, is, not, due, to, genetics, but, because, of, environmental, factors, such, as, disease, accidents, and, malnutrition, especially, since, the, former, were, not, generally, treatable, with, pre, 20th, century, medicine, deaths, from, childbirth, were, common, for, women, and, many, children, did, not, live, past, infancy, in, addition, most, people, who, did, attain, old, age, were, likely, to, die, quickly, from, the, above, mentioned, untreatable, health, problems, despite, this, there, are, several, examples, of, pre, 20th, century, individuals, attaining, lifespans, of, 85, years, or, greater, including, john, adams, cato, the, elder, thomas, hobbes, christopher, polhem, and, michelangelo, this, was, also, true, for, poorer, people, like, peasants, or, laborers, genealogists, will, almost, certainly, find, ancestors, living, to, their, 70s, 80s, and, even, 90s, several, hundred, years, ago, for, example, an, 1871, census, in, the, uk, the, first, of, its, kind, but, personal, data, from, other, censuses, dates, back, to, 1841, and, numerical, data, back, to, 1801, found, the, average, male, life, expectancy, as, being, 44, but, if, infant, mortality, is, subtracted, males, who, lived, to, adulthood, averaged, 75, years, the, present, life, expectancy, in, the, uk, is, 77, years, for, males, and, 81, for, females, while, the, united, states, averages, 74, for, males, and, 80, for, females, studies, have, shown, that, black, american, males, have, the, shortest, lifespans, of, any, group, of, people, in, the, us, averaging, only, 69, years, asian, american, females, average, the, longest, this, reflects, overall, poorer, health, and, greater, prevalence, of, heart, disease, obesity, diabetes, and, cancer, among, black, american, men, women, normally, outlive, men, theories, for, this, include, smaller, bodies, that, place, lesser, strain, on, the, heart, women, have, lower, rates, of, cardiovascular, disease, and, a, reduced, tendency, to, engage, in, physically, dangerous, activities, conversely, women, are, more, likely, to, participate, in, health, promoting, activities, the, x, chromosome, also, contains, more, genes, related, to, the, immune, system, and, women, tend, to, mount, a, stronger, immune, response, to, pathogens, than, men, however, the, idea, that, men, have, weaker, immune, systems, due, to, the, supposed, immuno, suppressive, actions, of, testosterone, is, unfounded, there, is, debate, as, to, whether, the, pursuit, of, longevity, is, a, worthwhile, health, care, goal, bioethicist, ezekiel, emanuel, who, is, also, one, of, the, architects, of, obamacare, has, argued, that, the, pursuit, of, longevity, via, the, compression, of, morbidity, explanation, is, a, fantasy, and, that, longevity, past, age, 75, should, not, be, considered, an, end, in, itself, this, has, been, challenged, by, neurosurgeon, miguel, faria, who, states, that, life, can, be, worthwhile, in, healthy, old, age, that, the, compression, of, morbidity, is, a, real, phenomenon, and, that, longevity, should, be, pursued, in, association, with, quality, of, life, faria, has, discussed, how, longevity, in, association, with, leading, healthy, lifestyles, can, lead, to, the, postponement, of, senescence, as, well, as, happiness, and, wisdom, in, old, age, most, biological, organisms, have, a, naturally, limited, longevity, due, to, aging, unlike, a, rare, few, that, are, considered, biologically, immortal, given, that, different, species, of, animals, and, plants, have, different, potentials, for, longevity, the, disrepair, accumulation, theory, of, aging, tries, to, explain, how, the, potential, for, longevity, of, an, organism, is, sometimes, positively, correlated, to, its, structural, complexity, it, suggests, that, while, biological, complexity, increases, individual, lifespan, it, is, counteracted, in, nature, since, the, survivability, of, the, overall, species, may, be, hindered, when, it, results, in, a, prolonged, development, process, which, is, an, evolutionarily, vulnerable, state, according, to, the, antagonistic, pleiotropy, hypothesis, one, of, the, reasons, biological, immortality, is, so, rare, is, that, certain, categories, of, gene, expression, that, are, beneficial, in, youth, become, deleterious, at, an, older, age, longevity, myths, are, traditions, about, long, lived, people, generally, supercentenarians, either, as, individuals, or, groups, of, people, and, practices, that, have, been, believed, to, confer, longevity, but, for, which, scientific, evidence, does, not, support, the, ages, claimed, or, the, reasons, for, the, claims, a, comparison, and, contrast, of, longevity, in, antiquity, such, as, the, sumerian, king, list, the, genealogies, of, genesis, and, the, persian, shahnameh, with, longevity, in, historical, times, common, era, cases, through, twentieth, century, news, reports, is, elaborated, in, detail, in, lucian, boia, s, 2004, book, forever, young, a, cultural, history, of, longevity, from, antiquity, to, the, present, and, other, sources, after, the, death, of, juan, ponce, de, le, n, gonzalo, fern, ndez, de, oviedo, y, vald, s, wrote, in, historia, general, y, natural, de, las, indias, 1535, that, ponce, de, le, n, was, looking, for, the, waters, of, bimini, to, cure, his, aging, traditions, that, have, been, believed, to, confer, greater, human, longevity, also, include, alchemy, such, as, that, attributed, to, nicolas, flamel, in, the, modern, era, the, okinawa, diet, has, some, reputation, of, linkage, to, exceptionally, high, ages, longevity, claims, may, be, subcategorized, into, four, groups, in, late, life, very, old, people, often, tend, to, advance, their, ages, at, the, rate, of, about, 17, years, per, decade, several, celebrated, super, centenarians, over, 110, years, are, believed, to, have, been, double, lives, father, and, son, relations, with, the, same, names, or, successive, bearers, of, a, title, a, number, of, instances, have, been, commercially, sponsored, while, a, fourth, category, of, recent, claims, are, those, made, for, political, ends, the, estimate, of, 17, years, per, decade, was, corroborated, by, the, 1901, and, 1911, british, censuses, time, magazine, considered, that, by, the, soviet, union, longevity, had, been, elevated, to, a, state, supported, methuselah, cult, robert, ripley, regularly, reported, supercentenarian, claims, in, ripley, s, believe, it, or, not, usually, citing, his, own, reputation, as, a, fact, checker, to, claim, reliability, longevity, in, other, animals, can, shed, light, on, the, determinants, of, life, expectancy, in, humans, especially, when, found, in, related, mammals, however, important, contributions, to, longevity, research, have, been, made, by, research, in, other, species, ranging, from, yeast, to, flies, to, worms, in, fact, some, closely, related, species, of, vertebrates, can, have, dramatically, different, life, expectancies, demonstrating, that, relatively, small, genetic, changes, can, have, a, dramatic, impact, on, aging, for, instance, pacific, ocean, rockfishes, have, widely, varying, lifespans, the, species, sebastes, minor, lives, a, mere, 11, years, while, its, cousin, sebastes, aleutianus, can, live, for, more, than, 2, centuries, similarly, a, chameleon, furcifer, labordi, is, the, current, record, holder, for, shortest, lifespan, among, tetrapods, with, only, 4, 5, months, to, live, by, contrast, some, of, its, relatives, such, as, furcifer, pardalis, have, been, found, to, live, up, to, 6, years, there, are, studies, about, aging, related, characteristics, of, and, aging, in, long, lived, animals, like, various, turtles, and, plants, like, ginkgo, biloba, trees, they, have, identified, potentially, causal, protective, traits, and, suggest, many, of, the, species, have, slow, or, negligible, senescence, or, aging, the, jellyfish, t, dohrnii, is, biologically, immortal, and, has, been, studied, by, comparative, genomics, honey, bees, apis, mellifera, are, eusocial, insects, that, display, dramatic, caste, specific, differences, in, longevity, queen, bees, live, for, an, average, of, 1, 2, years, compared, to, workers, who, live, on, average, 15, 38, days, in, summer, and, 150, 200, days, in, winter, worker, honey, bees, with, high, amounts, of, flight, experience, exhibit, increased, dna, damage, in, flight, muscle, as, measured, by, elevated, 8, oxo, 2, deoxyguanosine, compared, to, bees, with, less, flight, experience, this, increased, dna, damage, is, likely, due, to, an, imbalance, of, pro, and, anti, oxidants, during, flight, associated, oxidative, stress, flight, induced, oxidative, dna, damage, appears, to, hasten, senescence, and, reduce, longevity, in, a, mellifera, gene, editing, via, crispr, cas9, and, other, methods, have, significantly, altered, lifespans, in, animals, media, related, to, longevity, at, wikimedia, commons
