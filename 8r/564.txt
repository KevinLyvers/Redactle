the, komodo, dragon, varanus, komodoensis, also, known, as, the, komodo, monitor, is, a, large, reptile, of, the, monitor, lizard, family, varanidae, that, is, endemic, to, the, indonesian, islands, of, komodo, rinca, flores, and, gili, motang, it, is, the, largest, extant, species, of, lizard, with, the, males, growing, to, a, maximum, length, of, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, and, weighing, up, to, 150, kg, 330, lb, as, a, result, of, their, size, komodo, dragons, are, apex, predators, and, dominate, the, ecosystems, in, which, they, live, komodo, dragons, hunt, and, ambush, prey, including, invertebrates, birds, and, mammals, komodo, dragons, group, behavior, in, hunting, is, exceptional, in, the, reptile, world, the, diet, of, komodo, dragons, mainly, consists, of, javan, rusa, rusa, timorensis, though, they, also, eat, considerable, amounts, of, carrion, komodo, dragons, also, occasionally, attack, humans, mating, begins, between, may, and, august, and, the, eggs, are, laid, in, september, as, many, as, 20, eggs, are, deposited, at, a, time, in, an, abandoned, megapode, nest, or, in, a, self, dug, nesting, hole, the, eggs, are, incubated, for, seven, to, eight, months, hatching, in, april, when, insects, are, most, plentiful, young, komodo, dragons, are, vulnerable, and, dwell, in, trees, to, avoid, predators, such, as, cannibalistic, adults, which, young, komodo, dragons, also, try, to, repel, by, rolling, in, feces, they, take, 8, to, 9, years, to, mature, and, are, estimated, to, live, up, to, 30, years, komodo, dragons, were, first, recorded, by, western, scientists, in, 1910, their, large, size, and, fearsome, reputation, make, them, popular, zoo, exhibits, in, the, wild, their, range, has, been, reduced, by, human, encroachment, and, is, likely, to, contract, further, from, the, effects, of, climate, change, hence, they, are, listed, as, endangered, by, the, iucn, red, list, they, are, protected, under, indonesian, law, and, komodo, national, park, was, founded, in, 1980, to, aid, protection, efforts, komodo, dragons, were, first, documented, by, europeans, in, 1910, when, rumors, of, a, land, crocodile, reached, lieutenant, van, steyn, van, hensbroek, of, the, dutch, colonial, administration, widespread, notoriety, came, after, 1912, when, peter, ouwens, the, director, of, the, zoological, museum, of, bogor, java, published, a, paper, on, the, topic, after, receiving, a, photo, and, a, skin, from, the, lieutenant, as, well, as, two, other, specimens, from, a, collector, the, first, two, live, komodo, dragons, to, arrive, in, europe, were, exhibited, in, the, reptile, house, at, london, zoo, when, it, opened, in, 1927, joan, beauchamp, procter, made, some, of, the, earliest, observations, of, these, animals, in, captivity, and, she, demonstrated, their, behaviour, at, a, scientific, meeting, of, the, zoological, society, of, london, in, 1928, the, komodo, dragon, was, the, driving, factor, for, an, expedition, to, komodo, island, by, w, douglas, burden, in, 1926, after, returning, with, 12, preserved, specimens, and, two, live, ones, this, expedition, provided, the, inspiration, for, the, 1933, movie, king, kong, it, was, also, burden, who, coined, the, common, name, komodo, dragon, three, of, his, specimens, were, stuffed, and, are, still, on, display, in, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, the, dutch, island, administration, realizing, the, limited, number, of, individuals, in, the, wild, soon, outlawed, sport, hunting, and, heavily, limited, the, number, of, individuals, taken, for, scientific, study, collecting, expeditions, ground, to, a, halt, with, the, occurrence, of, world, war, ii, not, resuming, until, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, when, studies, examined, the, komodo, dragon, s, feeding, behavior, reproduction, and, body, temperature, at, around, this, time, an, expedition, was, planned, in, which, a, long, term, study, of, the, komodo, dragon, would, be, undertaken, this, task, was, given, to, the, auffenberg, family, who, stayed, on, komodo, island, for, 11, months, in, 1969, during, their, stay, walter, auffenberg, and, his, assistant, putra, sastrawan, captured, and, tagged, more, than, 50, komodo, dragons, research, from, the, auffenberg, expedition, proved, enormously, influential, in, raising, komodo, dragons, in, captivity, research, after, that, of, the, auffenberg, family, has, shed, more, light, on, the, nature, of, the, komodo, dragon, with, biologists, such, as, claudio, ciofi, continuing, to, study, the, creatures, the, komodo, dragon, is, also, sometimes, known, as, the, komodo, monitor, or, the, komodo, island, monitor, in, scientific, literature, although, these, names, are, uncommon, to, the, natives, of, komodo, island, it, is, referred, to, as, ora, buaya, darat, land, crocodile, or, biawak, raksasa, giant, monitor, genetic, analysis, of, mitochondrial, dna, shows, the, komodo, dragon, to, be, the, closest, relative, sister, taxon, of, the, australian, lace, monitor, v, varius, with, their, common, ancestor, diverging, from, a, lineage, that, gave, rise, to, the, crocodile, monitor, varanus, salvadorii, of, new, guinea, a, 2021, study, showed, that, during, the, late, miocene, the, ancestors, of, komodo, dragons, had, hybridized, with, the, common, ancestor, of, australian, sand, monitors, including, v, spenceri, v, gouldii, v, rosenbergi, and, v, panoptes, fossils, from, across, queensland, demonstrate, that, the, komodo, dragon, was, once, present, in, australia, with, fossils, spanning, from, the, early, pliocene, 3, 8, million, years, ago, to, the, middle, pleistocene, with, the, youngest, confirmed, records, of, the, species, in, australia, dating, to, at, latest, 330, 000, years, ago, in, australia, it, coexisted, with, the, even, larger, monitor, species, varanus, priscus, also, known, as, megalania, the, largest, terrestrial, lizard, ever, the, oldest, records, of, the, komodo, dragon, on, flores, date, to, around, 1, 4, million, years, ago, during, the, early, pleistocene, additionally, pleistocene, fossils, of, varanus, found, in, java, and, timor, may, belong, to, the, komodo, dragon, in, the, wild, adult, komodo, dragons, usually, weigh, around, 70, kg, 150, lb, although, captive, specimens, often, weigh, more, according, to, guinness, world, records, an, average, adult, male, will, weigh, 79, to, 91, kg, 174, to, 201, lb, and, measure, 2, 59, m, 8, 5, ft, while, an, average, female, will, weigh, 68, to, 73, kg, 150, to, 161, lb, and, measure, 2, 29, m, 7, 5, ft, the, largest, verified, specimen, in, captivity, was, 3, 13, m, 10, ft, 3, in, long, and, weighed, 166, kg, 366, lb, including, its, undigested, food, the, largest, wild, specimen, had, a, length, 3, 04, m, 10, ft, a, snout, vent, length, svl, 1, 54, m, 5, ft, 1, in, and, a, mass, of, 81, 5, kg, 180, lb, excluding, stomach, contents, the, heaviest, reached, a, mass, of, 87, 4, kg, 193, lb, the, study, noted, that, weights, greater, than, 100, kg, 220, lb, were, possible, but, only, after, the, animal, had, consumed, a, large, meal, the, komodo, dragon, has, a, tail, as, long, as, its, body, as, well, as, about, 60, frequently, replaced, serrated, teeth, that, can, measure, up, to, 2, 5, cm, 1, in, in, length, its, saliva, is, frequently, blood, tinged, because, its, teeth, are, almost, completely, covered, by, gingival, tissue, that, is, naturally, lacerated, during, feeding, it, also, has, a, long, yellow, deeply, forked, tongue, komodo, dragon, skin, is, reinforced, by, armoured, scales, which, contain, tiny, bones, called, osteoderms, that, function, as, a, sort, of, natural, chain, mail, the, only, areas, lacking, osteoderms, on, the, head, of, the, adult, komodo, dragon, are, around, the, eyes, nostrils, mouth, margins, and, parietal, eye, a, light, sensing, organ, on, the, top, of, the, head, where, lizards, typically, have, one, or, two, varying, patterns, or, shapes, of, osteoderms, komodos, have, four, rosette, platy, dendritic, and, vermiform, this, rugged, hide, makes, komodo, dragon, skin, a, poor, source, of, leather, additionally, these, osteoderms, become, more, extensive, and, variable, in, shape, as, the, komodo, dragon, ages, ossifying, more, extensively, as, the, lizard, grows, these, osteoderms, are, absent, in, hatchlings, and, juveniles, indicating, that, the, natural, armor, develops, as, a, product, of, age, and, competition, between, adults, for, protection, in, intraspecific, combat, over, food, and, mates, komodo, dragons, have, ziphodont, teeth, which, are, defined, as, teeth, that, are, laterally, flattened, recurved, and, with, serrated, tooth, crowns, where, the, serrations, have, a, dentine, core, and, a, very, thin, enamel, outer, layer, this, is, the, same, type, of, dentition, observed, in, many, extinct, theropod, dinosaurs, the, teeth, of, the, insectivorous, juveniles, in, contrast, are, barely, recurved, with, fewer, and, less, well, developed, serrations, that, lack, dentine, cores, a, 2024, study, published, in, nature, ecology, evolution, found, that, komodo, dragons, have, orange, iron, enriched, coatings, on, their, tooth, serrations, and, tips, as, an, adaptation, for, maintaining, the, sharp, cutting, edges, this, feature, is, also, observed, to, a, lesser, degree, in, a, few, other, australasian, to, asian, monitor, species, though, notably, absent, in, a, few, other, species, from, that, range, teeth, are, quickly, replaced, every, 40, days, while, maintaining, up, to, 5, replacement, teeth, for, each, tooth, position, at, any, given, time, this, high, rate, of, replacement, and, large, number, of, replacement, teeth, is, similar, to, that, of, the, crocodile, monitor, many, other, monitor, species, as, well, as, chinese, crocodile, lizards, and, beaded, lizards, only, have, 1, 2, replacement, teeth, behind, each, tooth, position, as, with, other, varanids, komodo, dragons, have, only, a, single, ear, bone, the, stapes, for, transferring, vibrations, from, the, tympanic, membrane, to, the, cochlea, this, arrangement, means, they, are, likely, restricted, to, sounds, in, the, 400, to, 2, 000, hertz, range, compared, to, humans, who, hear, between, 20, and, 20, 000, hertz, they, were, formerly, thought, to, be, deaf, when, a, study, reported, no, agitation, in, wild, komodo, dragons, in, response, to, whispers, raised, voices, or, shouts, this, was, disputed, when, london, zoo, employee, joan, procter, trained, a, captive, specimen, to, come, out, to, feed, at, the, sound, of, her, voice, even, when, she, could, not, be, seen, 52, the, komodo, dragon, can, see, objects, as, far, away, as, 300, m, 980, ft, but, because, its, retinas, only, contain, cones, it, is, thought, to, have, poor, night, vision, it, can, distinguish, colours, but, has, poor, visual, discrimination, of, stationary, objects, as, with, many, other, reptiles, the, komodo, dragon, primarily, relies, on, its, tongue, to, detect, taste, and, smell, stimuli, with, the, vomeronasal, sense, using, the, jacobson, s, organ, rather, than, using, the, nostrils, with, the, help, of, a, favorable, wind, and, its, habit, of, swinging, its, head, from, side, to, side, as, it, walks, a, komodo, dragon, may, be, able, to, detect, carrion, from, 4, 9, 5, km, 2, 5, 5, 9, mi, away, it, only, has, a, few, taste, buds, in, the, back, of, its, throat, its, scales, some, of, which, are, reinforced, with, bone, have, sensory, plaques, connected, to, nerves, to, facilitate, its, sense, of, touch, the, scales, around, the, ears, lips, chin, and, soles, of, the, feet, may, have, three, or, more, sensory, plaques, the, komodo, dragon, prefers, hot, and, dry, places, and, typically, lives, in, dry, open, grassland, savanna, and, tropical, forest, at, low, elevations, as, an, ectotherm, it, is, most, active, in, the, day, although, it, exhibits, some, nocturnal, activity, komodo, dragons, are, solitary, coming, together, only, to, breed, and, eat, they, are, capable, of, running, rapidly, in, brief, sprints, up, to, 20, km, h, 12, mph, diving, up, to, 4, 5, m, 15, ft, and, climbing, trees, proficiently, when, young, through, use, of, their, strong, claws, to, catch, out, of, reach, prey, the, komodo, dragon, may, stand, on, its, hind, legs, and, use, its, tail, as, a, support, 144, as, it, matures, its, claws, are, used, primarily, as, weapons, as, its, great, size, makes, climbing, impractical, for, shelter, the, komodo, dragon, digs, holes, that, can, measure, from, 1, to, 3, m, 3, 3, to, 9, 8, ft, wide, with, its, powerful, forelimbs, and, claws, because, of, its, large, size, and, habit, of, sleeping, in, these, burrows, it, is, able, to, conserve, body, heat, throughout, the, night, and, minimise, its, basking, period, the, morning, after, the, komodo, dragon, stays, in, the, shade, during, the, hottest, part, of, the, day, and, hunts, in, the, afternoon, these, special, resting, places, usually, located, on, ridges, with, cool, sea, breezes, are, marked, with, droppings, and, are, cleared, of, vegetation, they, serve, as, strategic, locations, from, which, to, ambush, deer, komodo, dragons, are, apex, predators, they, are, carnivores, although, they, have, been, considered, as, eating, mostly, carrion, they, will, frequently, ambush, live, prey, with, a, stealthy, approach, when, suitable, prey, arrives, near, a, dragon, s, ambush, site, it, will, suddenly, charge, at, the, animal, at, high, speeds, and, go, for, the, underside, or, the, throat, komodo, dragons, do, not, deliberately, allow, the, prey, to, escape, with, fatal, injuries, but, try, to, kill, prey, outright, using, a, combination, of, lacerating, damage, and, blood, loss, they, have, been, recorded, as, killing, wild, pigs, within, seconds, and, observations, of, komodo, dragons, tracking, prey, for, long, distances, are, likely, misinterpreted, cases, of, prey, escaping, an, attack, before, succumbing, to, infection, most, prey, attacked, by, a, komodo, dragon, reputedly, suffer, from, said, sepsis, and, will, later, be, eaten, by, the, same, or, other, lizards, komodo, dragons, eat, by, tearing, large, chunks, of, flesh, and, swallowing, them, whole, while, holding, the, carcass, down, with, their, forelegs, for, smaller, prey, up, to, the, size, of, a, goat, their, loosely, articulated, jaws, flexible, skulls, and, expandable, stomachs, allow, them, to, swallow, prey, whole, the, undigested, vegetable, contents, of, a, prey, animal, s, stomach, and, intestines, are, typically, avoided, copious, amounts, of, red, saliva, the, komodo, dragons, produce, help, to, lubricate, the, food, but, swallowing, is, still, a, long, process, 15, 20, minutes, to, swallow, a, goat, a, komodo, dragon, may, attempt, to, speed, up, the, process, by, ramming, the, carcass, against, a, tree, to, force, it, down, its, throat, sometimes, ramming, so, forcefully, that, the, tree, is, knocked, down, a, small, tube, under, the, tongue, that, connects, to, the, lungs, allows, it, to, breathe, while, swallowing, after, eating, up, to, 80, of, its, body, weight, in, one, meal, it, drags, itself, to, a, sunny, location, to, speed, digestion, as, the, food, could, rot, and, poison, the, dragon, if, left, undigested, in, its, stomach, for, too, long, because, of, their, slow, metabolism, large, dragons, can, survive, on, as, few, as, 12, meals, a, year, after, digestion, the, komodo, dragon, regurgitates, a, mass, of, horns, hair, and, teeth, known, as, the, gastric, pellet, which, is, covered, in, malodorous, mucus, after, regurgitating, the, gastric, pellet, it, rubs, its, face, in, the, dirt, or, on, bushes, to, get, rid, of, the, mucus, the, eating, habits, of, komodo, dragons, follow, a, hierarchy, with, the, larger, animals, generally, eating, before, the, smaller, ones, the, largest, male, typically, asserts, his, dominance, and, the, smaller, males, show, their, submission, by, use, of, body, language, and, rumbling, hisses, dragons, of, equal, size, may, resort, to, wrestling, losers, usually, retreat, though, they, have, been, known, to, be, killed, and, eaten, by, victors, the, komodo, dragon, s, diet, varies, depending, on, stage, of, growth, young, komodo, dragons, will, eat, insects, birds, and, bird, s, eggs, and, small, reptiles, while, larger, komodo, dragons, typically, over, 20, kg, 44, lb, prefer, large, ungulate, prey, such, as, javan, rusa, deer, wild, pigs, and, water, buffalo, occasionally, they, attack, and, bite, humans, sometimes, they, consume, human, corpses, digging, up, bodies, from, shallow, graves, 84, this, habit, of, raiding, graves, caused, the, villagers, of, komodo, to, move, their, graves, from, sandy, to, clay, ground, and, pile, rocks, on, top, of, them, to, deter, the, lizards, dwarf, species, of, stegodon, a, proboscidean, related, to, living, elephants, are, suggested, to, have, been, a, primary, prey, item, of, the, komodo, dragon, during, the, pleistocene, prior, to, the, introduction, of, their, modern, ungulate, prey, which, were, only, introduced, to, the, islands, in, the, holocene, around, 10, 7, 000, years, ago, the, komodo, dragon, drinks, by, sucking, water, into, its, mouth, via, buccal, pumping, a, process, also, used, for, respiration, lifting, its, head, and, letting, the, water, run, down, its, throat, although, previous, studies, proposed, that, komodo, dragon, saliva, contains, a, variety, of, highly, septic, bacteria, that, would, help, to, bring, down, prey, research, in, 2013, suggested, that, the, bacteria, in, the, mouths, of, komodo, dragons, are, ordinary, and, similar, to, those, found, in, other, carnivores, komodo, dragons, have, good, mouth, hygiene, to, quote, bryan, fry, after, they, are, done, feeding, they, will, spend, 10, to, 15, minutes, lip, licking, and, rubbing, their, head, in, the, leaves, to, clean, their, mouth, unlike, people, have, been, led, to, believe, they, do, not, have, chunks, of, rotting, flesh, from, their, meals, on, their, teeth, cultivating, bacteria, they, do, have, a, slashing, bite, which, normally, includes, a, dose, of, their, neurotoxin, venom, and, anticoagulant, saliva, komodo, dragons, do, not, wait, for, prey, to, die, and, track, it, at, a, distance, as, vipers, do, observations, of, them, hunting, deer, boar, and, in, some, cases, buffalo, reveal, that, they, kill, prey, in, less, than, half, an, hour, the, observation, of, prey, dying, of, sepsis, would, then, be, explained, by, the, natural, instinct, of, water, buffalos, who, are, not, native, to, the, islands, where, the, komodo, dragon, lives, to, run, into, water, after, escaping, an, attack, the, warm, faeces, filled, water, would, then, cause, the, infections, the, study, used, samples, from, 16, captive, dragons, 10, adults, and, six, neonates, from, three, us, zoos, researchers, have, isolated, a, powerful, antibacterial, peptide, from, the, blood, plasma, of, komodo, dragons, vk25, based, on, their, analysis, of, this, peptide, they, have, synthesized, a, short, peptide, dubbed, drgn, 1, and, tested, it, against, multidrug, resistant, mdr, pathogens, preliminary, results, of, these, tests, show, that, drgn, 1, is, effective, in, killing, drug, resistant, bacterial, strains, and, even, some, fungi, it, has, the, added, observed, benefit, of, significantly, promoting, wound, healing, in, both, uninfected, and, mixed, biofilm, infected, wounds, in, late, 2005, researchers, at, the, university, of, melbourne, speculated, the, perentie, varanus, giganteus, other, species, of, monitors, and, agamids, may, be, somewhat, venomous, the, team, believes, the, immediate, effects, of, bites, from, these, lizards, were, caused, by, mild, envenomation, bites, on, human, digits, by, a, lace, monitor, v, varius, a, komodo, dragon, and, a, spotted, tree, monitor, v, timorensis, all, produced, similar, effects, rapid, swelling, localised, disruption, of, blood, clotting, and, shooting, pain, up, to, the, elbow, with, some, symptoms, lasting, for, several, hours, in, 2009, the, same, researchers, published, further, evidence, demonstrating, komodo, dragons, possess, a, venomous, bite, mri, scans, of, a, preserved, skull, showed, the, presence, of, two, glands, in, the, lower, jaw, the, researchers, extracted, one, of, these, glands, from, the, head, of, a, terminally, ill, dragon, in, the, singapore, zoological, gardens, and, found, it, secreted, several, different, toxic, proteins, the, known, functions, of, these, proteins, include, inhibition, of, blood, clotting, lowering, of, blood, pressure, muscle, paralysis, and, the, induction, of, hypothermia, leading, to, shock, and, loss, of, consciousness, in, envenomated, prey, as, a, result, of, the, discovery, the, previous, theory, that, bacteria, were, responsible, for, the, deaths, of, komodo, victims, was, disputed, other, scientists, have, stated, that, this, allegation, of, venom, glands, has, had, the, effect, of, underestimating, the, variety, of, complex, roles, played, by, oral, secretions, in, the, biology, of, reptiles, produced, a, very, narrow, view, of, oral, secretions, and, resulted, in, misinterpretation, of, reptilian, evolution, according, to, these, scientists, reptilian, oral, secretions, contribute, to, many, biological, roles, other, than, to, quickly, dispatch, prey, these, researchers, concluded, that, calling, all, in, this, clade, venomous, implies, an, overall, potential, danger, that, does, not, exist, misleads, in, the, assessment, of, medical, risks, and, confuses, the, biological, assessment, of, squamate, biochemical, systems, evolutionary, biologist, schwenk, says, that, even, if, the, lizards, have, venom, like, proteins, in, their, mouths, they, may, be, using, them, for, a, different, function, and, he, doubts, venom, is, necessary, to, explain, the, effect, of, a, komodo, dragon, bite, arguing, that, shock, and, blood, loss, are, the, primary, factors, mating, occurs, between, may, and, august, with, the, eggs, laid, in, september, during, this, period, males, fight, over, females, and, territory, by, grappling, with, one, another, upon, their, hind, legs, with, the, loser, eventually, being, pinned, to, the, ground, these, males, may, vomit, or, defecate, when, preparing, for, the, fight, the, winner, of, the, fight, will, then, flick, his, long, tongue, at, the, female, to, gain, information, about, her, receptivity, females, are, antagonistic, and, resist, with, their, claws, and, teeth, during, the, early, phases, of, courtship, therefore, the, male, must, fully, restrain, the, female, during, coitus, to, avoid, being, hurt, other, courtship, displays, include, males, rubbing, their, chins, on, the, female, hard, scratches, to, the, back, and, licking, copulation, occurs, when, the, male, inserts, one, of, his, hemipenes, into, the, female, s, cloaca, komodo, dragons, may, be, monogamous, and, form, pair, bonds, a, rare, behavior, for, lizards, female, komodos, lay, their, eggs, from, august, to, september, and, may, use, several, types, of, locality, in, one, study, 60, laid, their, eggs, in, the, nests, of, orange, footed, scrubfowl, a, moundbuilder, or, megapode, 20, on, ground, level, and, 20, in, hilly, areas, the, females, make, many, camouflage, nests, holes, to, prevent, other, dragons, from, eating, the, eggs, nests, typically, house, one, female, however, a, study, found, evidence, of, two, females, occasionally, occupying, the, same, den, clutches, contain, an, average, of, 20, eggs, which, have, an, incubation, period, of, 7, 8, months, hatching, is, an, exhausting, effort, for, the, neonates, which, break, out, of, their, eggshells, with, an, egg, tooth, that, falls, off, before, long, after, cutting, themselves, out, the, hatchlings, may, lie, in, their, eggshells, for, hours, before, starting, to, dig, out, of, the, nest, they, are, born, quite, defenseless, and, are, vulnerable, to, predation, sixteen, youngsters, from, a, single, nest, were, on, average, 46, 5, cm, long, and, weighed, 105, 1, grams, young, komodo, dragons, spend, much, of, their, first, few, years, in, trees, where, they, are, relatively, safe, from, predators, including, cannibalistic, adults, as, juvenile, dragons, make, up, 10, of, their, diets, the, habit, of, cannibalism, may, be, advantageous, in, sustaining, the, large, size, of, adults, as, medium, sized, prey, on, the, islands, is, rare, when, the, young, approach, a, kill, they, roll, around, in, faecal, matter, and, rest, in, the, intestines, of, eviscerated, animals, to, deter, these, hungry, adults, komodo, dragons, take, approximately, 8, to, 9, years, to, mature, and, may, live, for, up, to, 30, years, a, komodo, dragon, at, london, zoo, named, sungai, laid, a, clutch, of, eggs, in, late, 2005, after, being, separated, from, male, company, for, more, than, two, years, scientists, initially, assumed, she, had, been, able, to, store, sperm, from, her, earlier, encounter, with, a, male, an, adaptation, known, as, superfecundation, on, 20, december, 2006, it, was, reported, that, flora, a, captive, komodo, dragon, living, in, the, chester, zoo, in, england, was, the, second, known, komodo, dragon, to, have, laid, unfertilised, eggs, she, laid, 11, eggs, and, seven, of, them, hatched, all, of, them, male, scientists, at, liverpool, university, in, england, performed, genetic, tests, on, three, eggs, that, collapsed, after, being, moved, to, an, incubator, and, verified, flora, had, never, been, in, physical, contact, with, a, male, dragon, after, flora, s, eggs, condition, had, been, discovered, testing, showed, sungai, s, eggs, were, also, produced, without, outside, fertilization, on, 31, january, 2008, the, sedgwick, county, zoo, in, wichita, kansas, became, the, first, zoo, in, the, americas, to, document, parthenogenesis, in, komodo, dragons, the, zoo, has, two, adult, female, komodo, dragons, one, of, which, laid, about, 17, eggs, on, 19, 20, may, 2007, only, two, eggs, were, incubated, and, hatched, due, to, space, issues, the, first, hatched, on, 31, january, 2008, while, the, second, hatched, on, 1, february, both, hatchlings, were, males, komodo, dragons, have, the, zw, chromosomal, sex, determination, system, as, opposed, to, the, mammalian, xy, system, male, progeny, prove, flora, s, unfertilized, eggs, were, haploid, n, and, doubled, their, chromosomes, later, to, become, diploid, 2n, by, being, fertilized, by, a, polar, body, or, by, chromosome, duplication, without, cell, division, rather, than, by, her, laying, diploid, eggs, by, one, of, the, meiosis, reduction, divisions, in, her, ovaries, failing, when, a, female, komodo, dragon, with, zw, sex, chromosomes, reproduces, in, this, manner, she, provides, her, progeny, with, only, one, chromosome, from, each, of, her, pairs, of, chromosomes, including, only, one, of, her, two, sex, chromosomes, this, single, set, of, chromosomes, is, duplicated, in, the, egg, which, develops, parthenogenetically, eggs, receiving, a, z, chromosome, become, zz, male, those, receiving, a, w, chromosome, become, ww, and, fail, to, develop, meaning, that, only, males, are, produced, by, parthenogenesis, in, this, species, it, has, been, hypothesised, that, this, reproductive, adaptation, allows, a, single, female, to, enter, an, isolated, ecological, niche, such, as, an, island, and, by, parthenogenesis, produce, male, offspring, thereby, establishing, a, sexually, reproducing, population, via, reproduction, with, her, offspring, that, can, result, in, both, male, and, female, young, despite, the, advantages, of, such, an, adaptation, zoos, are, cautioned, that, parthenogenesis, may, be, detrimental, to, genetic, diversity, attacks, on, humans, are, rare, but, komodo, dragons, have, been, responsible, for, several, human, fatalities, both, in, the, wild, and, in, captivity, according, to, data, from, komodo, national, park, spanning, a, 38, year, period, between, 1974, and, 2012, there, were, 24, reported, attacks, on, humans, five, of, them, fatal, most, of, the, victims, were, local, villagers, living, around, the, national, park, the, komodo, dragon, is, classified, by, the, iucn, as, endangered, and, is, listed, on, the, iucn, red, list, the, species, sensitivity, to, natural, and, human, made, threats, has, long, been, recognized, by, conservationists, zoological, societies, and, the, indonesian, government, komodo, national, park, was, founded, in, 1980, to, protect, komodo, dragon, populations, on, islands, including, komodo, rinca, and, padar, later, the, wae, wuul, and, wolo, tado, reserves, were, opened, on, flores, to, aid, komodo, dragon, conservation, komodo, dragons, generally, avoid, encounters, with, humans, juveniles, are, very, shy, and, will, flee, quickly, into, a, hideout, if, a, human, comes, closer, than, about, 100, metres, 330, ft, older, animals, will, also, retreat, from, humans, from, a, shorter, distance, away, if, cornered, they, may, react, aggressively, by, gaping, their, mouth, hissing, and, swinging, their, tail, if, they, are, disturbed, further, they, may, attack, and, bite, although, there, are, anecdotes, of, unprovoked, komodo, dragons, attacking, or, preying, on, humans, most, of, these, reports, are, either, not, reputable, or, have, subsequently, been, interpreted, as, defensive, bites, only, very, few, cases, are, truly, the, result, of, unprovoked, attacks, by, atypical, individuals, who, lost, their, fear, of, humans, volcanic, activity, earthquakes, loss, of, habitat, fire, tourism, loss, of, prey, due, to, poaching, and, illegal, poaching, of, the, dragons, themselves, have, all, contributed, to, the, vulnerable, status, of, the, komodo, dragon, a, major, future, threat, to, the, species, is, climate, change, via, both, aridification, and, sea, level, rise, which, can, affect, the, low, lying, habitats, and, valleys, that, the, komodo, dragon, depends, on, as, komodo, dragons, do, not, range, into, the, higher, altitude, regions, of, the, islands, they, inhabit, based, on, projections, climate, change, will, lead, to, a, decline, in, suitable, habitat, of, 8, 4, 30, 2, or, 71, by, 2050, depending, on, the, climate, change, scenario, without, effective, conservation, actions, populations, on, flores, are, extirpated, in, all, scenarios, while, in, the, more, extreme, scenarios, only, the, populations, on, komodo, and, rinca, persist, in, highly, reduced, numbers, rapid, climate, change, mitigation, is, crucial, for, conserving, the, species, in, the, wild, other, scientists, have, disputed, the, conclusions, about, the, effects, of, climate, change, on, komodo, dragon, populations, under, appendix, i, of, cites, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, commercial, international, trade, of, komodo, dragon, skins, or, specimens, is, prohibited, despite, this, there, are, occasional, reports, of, illegal, attempts, to, trade, in, live, komodo, dragons, the, most, recent, attempt, was, in, march, 2019, when, indonesian, police, in, the, east, java, city, of, surabaya, reported, that, a, criminal, network, had, been, caught, trying, to, smuggle, 41, young, komodo, dragons, out, of, indonesia, the, plan, was, said, to, include, shipping, the, animals, to, several, other, countries, in, southeast, asia, through, singapore, it, was, hoped, that, the, animals, could, be, sold, for, up, to, 500, million, rupiah, around, us, 35, 000, each, it, was, believed, that, the, komodo, dragons, had, been, smuggled, out, of, east, nusa, tenggara, province, through, the, port, at, ende, in, central, flores, in, 2013, the, total, population, of, komodo, dragons, in, the, wild, was, assessed, as, 3, 222, individuals, declining, to, 3, 092, in, 2014, and, 3, 014, in, 2015, populations, remained, relatively, stable, on, the, bigger, islands, komodo, and, rinca, but, decreased, on, smaller, islands, such, as, nusa, kode, and, gili, motang, likely, due, to, diminishing, prey, availability, on, padar, a, former, population, of, komodo, dragons, has, recently, become, extirpated, of, which, the, last, individuals, were, seen, in, 1975, it, is, widely, assumed, that, the, komodo, dragon, died, out, on, padar, following, a, major, decline, of, populations, of, large, ungulate, prey, for, which, poaching, was, most, likely, responsible, komodo, dragons, have, long, been, sought, after, zoo, attractions, where, their, size, and, reputation, make, them, popular, exhibits, they, are, however, rare, in, zoos, because, they, are, susceptible, to, infection, and, parasitic, disease, if, captured, from, the, wild, and, do, not, readily, reproduce, in, captivity, a, pair, of, komodo, dragons, was, displayed, at, the, bronx, zoo, in, new, york, in, september, 1926, but, they, only, lasted, a, couple, of, months, dying, in, october, and, november, 1926, the, first, komodo, dragons, were, displayed, at, london, zoo, in, 1927, a, komodo, dragon, was, exhibited, in, 1934, in, the, united, states, at, the, national, zoo, in, washington, d, c, but, it, lived, for, only, two, years, more, attempts, to, exhibit, komodo, dragons, were, made, but, the, lifespan, of, the, animals, in, captivity, at, the, time, proved, very, short, averaging, five, years, in, the, national, zoological, park, studies, were, done, by, walter, auffenberg, which, were, documented, in, his, book, the, behavioral, ecology, of, the, komodo, monitor, eventually, allowing, for, more, successful, management, and, breeding, of, the, dragons, in, captivity, surabaya, zoo, in, indonesia, has, been, breeding, komodo, dragons, since, 1990, and, had, 134, dragons, in, 2022, the, largest, collection, outside, its, natural, habitat, as, of, may, 2009, there, were, 35, north, american, 13, european, one, singaporean, two, african, and, two, australian, institutions, which, housed, captive, komodo, dragons, in, 2016, four, komodo, dragons, were, transferred, from, bronx, zoo, to, madras, crocodile, bank, trust, in, india, a, variety, of, behaviors, have, been, observed, from, captive, specimens, most, individuals, become, relatively, tame, within, a, short, time, and, are, capable, of, recognising, individual, humans, and, discriminating, between, familiar, and, unfamiliar, keepers, komodo, dragons, have, also, been, observed, to, engage, in, play, with, a, variety, of, objects, including, shovels, cans, plastic, rings, and, shoes, this, behavior, does, not, seem, to, be, food, motivated, predatory, behavior, even, seemingly, docile, dragons, may, become, unpredictably, aggressive, especially, when, the, animal, s, territory, is, invaded, by, someone, unfamiliar, in, june, 2001, a, komodo, dragon, seriously, injured, phil, bronstein, the, then, husband, of, actress, sharon, stone, when, he, entered, its, enclosure, at, the, los, angeles, zoo, after, being, invited, in, by, its, keeper, bronstein, was, bitten, on, his, bare, foot, as, the, keeper, had, told, him, to, take, off, his, white, shoes, and, socks, which, the, keeper, stated, could, potentially, excite, the, komodo, dragon, as, they, were, the, same, colour, as, the, white, rats, the, zoo, fed, the, dragon, although, he, survived, bronstein, needed, to, have, several, tendons, in, his, foot, reattached, surgically
