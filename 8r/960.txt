asteraceae, s, t, r, e, s, i, i, a, is, a, large, family, of, flowering, plants, that, consists, of, over, 32, 000, known, species, in, over, 1, 900, genera, within, the, order, asterales, the, number, of, species, in, asteraceae, is, rivaled, only, by, the, orchidaceae, and, which, is, the, larger, family, is, unclear, as, the, quantity, of, extant, species, in, each, family, is, unknown, the, asteraceae, were, first, described, in, the, year, 1740, and, given, the, original, name, compositae, the, family, is, commonly, known, as, the, aster, daisy, composite, or, sunflower, family, most, species, of, asteraceae, are, herbaceous, plants, and, may, be, annual, biennial, or, perennial, but, there, are, also, shrubs, vines, and, trees, the, family, has, a, widespread, distribution, from, subpolar, to, tropical, regions, in, a, wide, variety, of, habitats, most, occur, in, hot, desert, and, cold, or, hot, semi, desert, climates, and, they, are, found, on, every, continent, but, antarctica, their, common, primary, characteristic, is, compound, flower, heads, technically, known, as, capitula, consisting, of, sometimes, hundreds, of, tiny, individual, florets, enclosed, by, a, whorl, of, protective, involucral, bracts, the, oldest, known, fossils, are, pollen, grains, from, the, late, cretaceous, campanian, to, maastrichtian, of, antarctica, dated, to, c, 76, 66, million, years, ago, mya, it, is, estimated, that, the, crown, group, of, asteraceae, evolved, at, least, 85, 9, mya, late, cretaceous, santonian, with, a, stem, node, age, of, 88, 89, mya, late, cretaceous, coniacian, asteraceae, is, an, economically, important, family, providing, food, staples, garden, plants, and, herbal, medicines, species, outside, of, their, native, ranges, can, become, weedy, or, invasive, members, of, the, asteraceae, are, mostly, herbaceous, plants, but, some, shrubs, vines, and, trees, such, as, lachanodes, arborea, do, exist, asteraceae, species, are, generally, easy, to, distinguish, from, other, plants, because, of, their, unique, inflorescence, and, other, shared, characteristics, such, as, the, joined, anthers, of, the, stamens, nonetheless, determining, genera, and, species, of, some, groups, such, as, hieracium, is, notoriously, difficult, see, damned, yellow, composite, for, example, members, of, the, family, asteraceae, generally, produce, taproots, but, sometimes, they, possess, fibrous, root, systems, some, species, have, underground, stems, in, the, form, of, caudices, or, rhizomes, these, can, be, fleshy, or, woody, depending, on, the, species, the, stems, are, herbaceous, aerial, branched, and, cylindrical, with, glandular, hairs, usually, erect, but, can, be, prostrate, to, ascending, the, stems, can, contain, secretory, canals, with, resin, or, latex, which, is, particularly, common, among, the, cichorioideae, leaves, can, be, alternate, opposite, or, whorled, they, may, be, simple, but, are, often, deeply, lobed, or, otherwise, incised, often, conduplicate, or, revolute, the, margins, also, can, be, entire, or, toothed, resin, or, latex, can, also, be, present, in, the, leaves, nearly, all, asteraceae, bear, their, flowers, in, dense, flower, heads, called, capitula, they, are, surrounded, by, involucral, bracts, and, when, viewed, from, a, distance, each, capitulum, may, appear, to, be, a, single, flower, enlarged, outer, peripheral, flowers, in, the, capitulum, may, resemble, petals, and, the, involucral, bracts, may, look, like, a, calyx, in, plants, of, the, asteraceae, what, appears, to, be, a, single, daisy, type, flower, is, actually, a, composite, of, several, much, smaller, flowers, known, as, the, capitulum, or, head, by, visually, presenting, as, a, single, flower, the, capitulum, functions, in, attracting, pollinators, in, the, same, manner, that, other, showy, flowering, plants, in, numerous, other, older, plant, families, have, evolved, to, attract, pollinators, the, previous, name, for, the, family, compositae, reflects, the, fact, that, what, appears, to, be, a, single, floral, entity, is, in, fact, a, composite, of, much, smaller, flowers, the, petals, or, sunrays, in, an, asteraceous, head, are, in, fact, individual, strap, shaped, flowers, called, ray, flowers, or, ray, florets, and, the, sun, disk, is, made, up, of, smaller, radially, symmetric, individual, flowers, called, disc, flowers, or, disc, florets, the, word, aster, means, star, in, greek, referring, to, the, appearance, of, most, family, members, as, a, celestial, body, with, rays, the, capitulum, which, often, appears, to, be, a, single, flower, is, often, referred, to, as, a, head, in, some, species, the, entire, head, is, able, to, pivot, its, floral, stem, in, the, course, of, the, day, to, track, the, sun, like, a, smart, solar, panel, thus, maximizing, the, reflectivity, of, the, entire, floral, unit, and, further, attracting, flying, pollinators, nearest, to, the, flower, stem, lie, a, series, of, small, usually, green, scale, like, bracts, these, are, known, as, phyllaries, collectively, they, form, the, involucre, which, serves, to, protect, the, immature, head, of, florets, during, its, development, 29, the, individual, florets, are, arranged, atop, a, dome, like, structure, called, the, receptacle, the, individual, florets, in, a, head, consist, developmentally, of, five, fused, petals, rarely, four, instead, of, sepals, they, have, threadlike, hairy, or, bristly, structures, known, collectively, as, a, pappus, plural, pappi, the, pappus, surrounds, the, ovary, and, can, when, mature, and, attached, to, a, seed, adhere, to, animal, fur, or, be, carried, by, air, currents, aiding, in, seed, dispersal, the, whitish, fluffy, head, of, a, dandelion, commonly, blown, on, by, children, consists, of, numerous, seeds, resting, on, the, receptacle, each, seed, attached, to, its, pappus, the, pappi, provide, a, parachute, like, structure, to, help, the, seed, travel, from, its, point, of, origin, to, a, more, hospitable, site, a, ray, flower, is, a, two, or, three, lobed, strap, shaped, individual, flower, found, in, the, head, of, most, members, of, the, asteraceae, the, corolla, of, the, ray, flower, may, have, two, tiny, vestigial, teeth, opposite, to, the, three, lobed, strap, or, tongue, indicating, its, evolution, by, fusion, from, an, ancestral, five, part, corolla, in, some, species, the, 3, 2, arrangement, is, reversed, with, two, lobes, and, zero, or, three, tiny, teeth, visible, opposite, the, tongue, a, ligulate, flower, is, a, five, lobed, strap, shaped, individual, flower, found, in, the, heads, of, certain, other, asteraceous, species, a, ligule, is, the, strap, shaped, tongue, of, the, corolla, of, either, a, ray, flower, or, of, a, ligulate, flower, a, disk, flower, or, disc, flower, is, a, radially, symmetric, individual, flower, in, the, head, which, is, ringed, by, the, ray, flowers, when, both, are, present, in, some, species, ray, flowers, may, be, arranged, around, the, disc, in, irregular, symmetry, or, with, a, weakly, bilaterally, symmetric, arrangement, a, radiate, head, has, disc, flowers, surrounded, by, ray, flowers, a, ligulate, head, has, all, ligulate, flowers, and, no, disc, flowers, when, an, asteraceae, flower, head, has, only, disc, flowers, that, are, either, sterile, male, or, bisexual, but, not, female, and, fertile, it, is, a, discoid, head, disciform, heads, possess, only, disc, flowers, in, their, heads, but, may, produce, two, different, sex, types, male, or, female, within, their, disciform, head, some, other, species, produce, two, different, head, types, staminate, all, male, or, pistillate, all, female, in, a, few, unusual, species, the, head, will, consist, of, one, single, disc, flower, alternatively, a, few, species, will, produce, both, single, flowered, female, heads, along, with, multi, flowered, male, heads, in, their, pollination, strategy, the, distinguishing, characteristic, of, asteraceae, is, their, inflorescence, a, type, of, specialised, composite, flower, head, or, pseudanthium, technically, called, a, calathium, or, capitulum, that, may, look, superficially, like, a, single, flower, the, capitulum, is, a, contracted, raceme, composed, of, numerous, individual, sessile, flowers, called, florets, all, sharing, the, same, receptacle, a, set, of, bracts, forms, an, involucre, surrounding, the, base, of, the, capitulum, these, are, called, phyllaries, or, involucral, bracts, they, may, simulate, the, sepals, of, the, pseudanthium, these, are, mostly, herbaceous, but, can, also, be, brightly, coloured, e, g, helichrysum, or, have, a, scarious, dry, and, membranous, texture, the, phyllaries, can, be, free, or, fused, and, arranged, in, one, to, many, rows, overlapping, like, the, tiles, of, a, roof, imbricate, or, not, this, variation, is, important, in, identification, of, tribes, and, genera, each, floret, may, be, subtended, by, a, bract, called, a, palea, or, receptacular, bract, these, bracts, are, often, called, chaff, the, presence, or, absence, of, these, bracts, their, distribution, on, the, receptacle, and, their, size, and, shape, are, all, important, diagnostic, characteristics, for, genera, and, tribes, the, florets, have, five, petals, fused, at, the, base, to, form, a, corolla, tube, and, they, may, be, either, actinomorphic, or, zygomorphic, disc, florets, are, usually, actinomorphic, with, five, petal, lips, on, the, rim, of, the, corolla, tube, the, petal, lips, may, be, either, very, short, or, long, in, which, case, they, form, deeply, lobed, petals, the, latter, is, the, only, kind, of, floret, in, the, carduoideae, while, the, first, kind, is, more, widespread, ray, florets, are, always, highly, zygomorphic, and, are, characterised, by, the, presence, of, a, ligule, a, strap, shaped, structure, on, the, edge, of, the, corolla, tube, consisting, of, fused, petals, in, the, asteroideae, and, other, minor, subfamilies, these, are, usually, borne, only, on, florets, at, the, circumference, of, the, capitulum, and, have, a, 3, 2, scheme, above, the, fused, corolla, tube, three, very, long, fused, petals, form, the, ligule, with, the, other, two, petals, being, inconspicuously, small, the, cichorioideae, has, only, ray, florets, with, a, 5, 0, scheme, all, five, petals, form, the, ligule, a, 4, 1, scheme, is, found, in, the, barnadesioideae, the, tip, of, the, ligule, is, often, divided, into, teeth, each, one, representing, a, petal, some, marginal, florets, may, have, no, petals, at, all, filiform, floret, the, calyx, of, the, florets, may, be, absent, but, when, present, is, always, modified, into, a, pappus, of, two, or, more, teeth, scales, or, bristles, and, this, is, often, involved, in, the, dispersion, of, the, seeds, as, with, the, bracts, the, nature, of, the, pappus, is, an, important, diagnostic, feature, there, are, usually, four, or, five, stamens, the, filaments, are, fused, to, the, corolla, while, the, anthers, are, generally, connate, syngenesious, anthers, thus, forming, a, sort, of, tube, around, the, style, theca, they, commonly, have, basal, and, or, apical, appendages, pollen, is, released, inside, the, tube, and, is, collected, around, the, growing, style, and, then, as, the, style, elongates, is, pushed, out, of, the, tube, n, delspritze, the, pistil, consists, of, two, connate, carpels, the, style, has, two, lobes, stigmatic, tissue, may, be, located, in, the, interior, surface, or, form, two, lateral, lines, the, ovary, is, inferior, and, has, only, one, ovule, with, basal, placentation, in, members, of, the, asteraceae, the, fruit, is, achene, like, and, is, called, a, cypsela, plural, cypselae, although, there, are, two, fused, carpels, there, is, only, one, locule, and, only, one, seed, per, fruit, is, formed, it, may, sometimes, be, winged, or, spiny, because, the, pappus, which, is, derived, from, calyx, tissue, often, remains, on, the, fruit, for, example, in, dandelion, in, some, species, however, the, pappus, falls, off, for, example, in, helianthus, cypsela, morphology, is, often, used, to, help, determine, plant, relationships, at, the, genus, and, species, level, the, mature, seeds, usually, have, little, endosperm, or, none, the, pollen, of, composites, is, typically, echinolophate, a, morphological, term, meaning, with, elaborate, systems, of, ridges, and, spines, dispersed, around, and, between, the, apertures, in, asteraceae, the, energy, store, is, generally, in, the, form, of, inulin, rather, than, starch, they, produce, iso, chlorogenic, acid, sesquiterpene, lactones, pentacyclic, triterpene, alcohols, various, alkaloids, acetylenes, cyclic, aromatic, with, vinyl, end, groups, tannins, they, have, terpenoid, essential, oils, that, never, contain, iridoids, asteraceae, produce, secondary, metabolites, such, as, flavonoids, and, terpenoids, some, of, these, molecules, can, inhibit, protozoan, parasites, such, as, plasmodium, trypanosoma, leishmania, and, parasitic, intestinal, worms, and, thus, have, potential, in, medicine, compositae, the, original, name, for, asteraceae, were, first, described, in, 1740, by, dutch, botanist, adriaan, van, royen, 117, 118, traditionally, two, subfamilies, were, recognised, asteroideae, or, tubuliflorae, and, cichorioideae, or, liguliflorae, 242, the, latter, has, been, shown, to, be, extensively, paraphyletic, and, has, now, been, divided, into, 12, subfamilies, but, the, former, still, stands, the, study, of, this, family, is, known, as, synantherology, the, phylogenetic, tree, of, subfamilies, presented, below, is, based, on, panero, funk, 2002, updated, in, 2014, and, now, also, includes, the, monotypic, famatinanthoideae, the, diamond, denotes, a, very, poorly, supported, node, 50, bootstrap, support, the, dot, a, poorly, supported, node, 80, barnadesioideae, 9, genera, 93, species, south, america,

corymbioideae, only, the, genus, corymbium, with, 9, species, cape, provinces, south, africa, asteroideae, 1, 130, genera, and, 16, 200, species, worldwide, the, family, includes, over, 32, 000, currently, accepted, species, in, over, 1, 900, genera, list, in, 13, subfamilies, the, number, of, species, in, the, family, asteraceae, is, rivaled, only, by, orchidaceae, which, is, the, larger, family, is, unclear, because, of, the, uncertainty, about, how, many, extant, species, each, family, includes, the, four, subfamilies, asteroideae, cichorioideae, carduoideae, and, mutisioideae, contain, 99, of, the, species, diversity, of, the, whole, family, approximately, 70, 14, 11, and, 3, respectively, because, of, the, morphological, complexity, exhibited, by, this, family, agreeing, on, generic, circumscriptions, has, often, been, difficult, for, taxonomists, as, a, result, several, of, these, genera, have, required, multiple, revisions, the, oldest, known, fossils, of, members, of, asteraceae, are, pollen, grains, from, the, late, cretaceous, of, antarctica, dated, to, 76, 66, mya, campanian, to, maastrichtian, and, assigned, to, the, extant, genus, dasyphyllum, barreda, et, al, 2015, estimated, that, the, crown, group, of, asteraceae, evolved, at, least, 85, 9, mya, late, cretaceous, santonian, with, a, stem, node, age, of, 88, 89, mya, late, cretaceous, coniacian, it, is, not, known, whether, the, precise, cause, of, their, great, success, was, the, development, of, the, highly, specialised, capitulum, their, ability, to, store, energy, as, fructans, mainly, inulin, which, is, an, advantage, in, relatively, dry, zones, or, some, combination, of, these, and, possibly, other, factors, heterocarpy, or, the, ability, to, produce, different, fruit, morphs, has, evolved, and, is, common, in, asteraceae, it, allows, seeds, to, be, dispersed, over, varying, distances, and, each, is, adapted, to, different, environments, increasing, chances, of, survival, the, original, name, compositae, is, still, valid, under, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, algae, fungi, and, plants, it, refers, to, the, composite, nature, of, the, capitula, which, consist, of, a, few, or, many, individual, flowers, the, alternative, as, it, came, later, name, asteraceae, english, s, t, r, e, s, i, s, i, a, s, i, e, s, i, i, comes, to, international, scientific, vocabulary, from, neo, latin, from, aster, the, type, genus, aceae, a, standardized, suffix, for, plant, family, names, in, modern, taxonomy, this, genus, name, comes, from, the, classical, latin, word, aster, star, which, came, from, ancient, greek, ast, r, star, it, refers, to, the, star, like, form, of, the, inflorescence, the, vernacular, name, daisy, widely, applied, to, members, of, this, family, is, derived, from, the, old, english, name, of, the, daisy, bellis, perennis, d, es, a, e, meaning, day, s, eye, this, is, because, the, petals, open, at, dawn, and, close, at, dusk, asteraceae, species, have, a, widespread, distribution, from, subpolar, to, tropical, regions, in, a, wide, variety, of, habitats, most, occur, in, hot, desert, and, cold, or, hot, semi, desert, climates, and, they, are, found, on, every, continent, but, antarctica, they, are, especially, numerous, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, notably, central, america, eastern, brazil, the, mediterranean, the, levant, southern, africa, central, asia, and, southwestern, china, the, largest, proportion, of, the, species, occur, in, the, arid, and, semi, arid, regions, of, subtropical, and, lower, temperate, latitudes, the, asteraceae, family, comprises, 10, of, all, flowering, plant, species, asteraceae, are, especially, common, in, open, and, dry, environments, many, members, of, asteraceae, are, pollinated, by, insects, which, explains, their, value, in, attracting, beneficial, insects, but, anemophily, is, also, present, e, g, ambrosia, artemisia, there, are, many, apomictic, species, in, the, family, seeds, are, ordinarily, dispersed, intact, with, the, fruiting, body, the, cypsela, anemochory, wind, dispersal, is, common, assisted, by, a, hairy, pappus, epizoochory, is, another, common, method, in, which, the, dispersal, unit, a, single, cypsela, e, g, bidens, or, entire, capitulum, e, g, arctium, has, hooks, spines, or, some, structure, to, attach, to, the, fur, or, plumage, or, even, clothes, as, in, the, photo, of, an, animal, just, to, fall, off, later, far, from, its, mother, plant, some, members, of, asteraceae, are, economically, important, as, weeds, notable, in, the, united, states, are, senecio, jacobaea, ragwort, senecio, vulgaris, groundsel, and, taraxacum, dandelion, some, are, invasive, species, in, particular, regions, often, having, been, introduced, by, human, agency, examples, include, various, tumbleweeds, bidens, ragweeds, thistles, and, dandelion, dandelion, was, introduced, into, north, america, by, european, settlers, who, used, the, young, leaves, as, a, salad, green, a, number, of, species, are, toxic, to, grazing, animals, asteraceae, is, an, economically, important, family, providing, products, such, as, cooking, oils, leaf, vegetables, like, lettuce, sunflower, seeds, artichokes, sweetening, agents, coffee, substitutes, and, herbal, teas, several, genera, are, of, horticultural, importance, including, pot, marigold, calendula, officinalis, echinacea, coneflowers, various, daisies, fleabane, chrysanthemums, dahlias, zinnias, and, heleniums, asteraceae, are, important, in, herbal, medicine, including, grindelia, yarrow, and, many, others, commercially, important, plants, in, asteraceae, include, the, food, crops, lactuca, sativa, lettuce, cichorium, chicory, cynara, scolymus, globe, artichoke, helianthus, annuus, sunflower, smallanthus, sonchifolius, yac, n, carthamus, tinctorius, safflower, and, helianthus, tuberosus, jerusalem, artichoke, plants, are, used, as, herbs, and, in, herbal, teas, and, other, beverages, chamomile, for, example, comes, from, two, different, species, the, annual, matricaria, chamomilla, german, chamomile, and, the, perennial, chamaemelum, nobile, roman, chamomile, calendula, known, as, pot, marigold, is, grown, commercially, for, herbal, teas, and, potpourri, echinacea, is, used, as, a, medicinal, tea, the, wormwood, genus, artemisia, includes, absinthe, a, absinthium, and, tarragon, a, dracunculus, winter, tarragon, tagetes, lucida, is, commonly, grown, and, used, as, a, tarragon, substitute, in, climates, where, tarragon, will, not, survive, many, members, of, the, family, are, grown, as, ornamental, plants, for, their, flowers, and, some, are, important, ornamental, crops, for, the, cut, flower, industry, some, examples, are, chrysanthemum, gerbera, calendula, dendranthema, argyranthemum, dahlia, tagetes, zinnia, and, many, others, many, species, of, this, family, possess, medicinal, properties, and, are, used, as, traditional, antiparasitic, medicine, members, of, the, family, are, also, commonly, featured, in, medical, and, phytochemical, journals, because, the, sesquiterpene, lactone, compounds, contained, within, them, are, an, important, cause, of, allergic, contact, dermatitis, allergy, to, these, compounds, is, the, leading, cause, of, allergic, contact, dermatitis, in, florists, in, the, us, pollen, from, ragweed, ambrosia, is, among, the, main, causes, of, so, called, hay, fever, in, the, united, states, asteraceae, are, also, used, for, some, industrial, purposes, french, marigold, tagetes, patula, is, common, in, commercial, poultry, feeds, and, its, oil, is, extracted, for, uses, in, cola, and, the, cigarette, industry, the, genera, chrysanthemum, pulicaria, tagetes, and, tanacetum, contain, species, with, useful, insecticidal, properties, parthenium, argentatum, guayule, is, a, source, of, hypoallergenic, latex, several, members, of, the, family, are, copious, nectar, producers, and, are, useful, for, evaluating, pollinator, populations, during, their, bloom, centaurea, knapweed, helianthus, annuus, domestic, sunflower, and, some, species, of, solidago, goldenrod, are, major, honey, plants, for, beekeepers, solidago, produces, relatively, high, protein, pollen, which, helps, honey, bees, over, winter
