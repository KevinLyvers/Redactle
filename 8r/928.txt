see, text, see, also, full, listing, agave, v, i, also, uk, e, v, i, anglo, hispanic, also, us, v, e, is, a, genus, of, monocots, native, to, the, arid, regions, of, the, americas, the, genus, is, primarily, known, for, its, succulent, and, xerophytic, species, that, typically, form, large, rosettes, of, strong, fleshy, leaves, many, plants, in, this, genus, may, be, considered, perennial, because, they, require, several, to, many, years, to, mature, and, flower, however, most, agave, species, are, more, accurately, described, as, monocarpic, rosettes, or, multiannuals, since, each, individual, rosette, flowers, only, once, and, then, dies, a, small, number, of, agave, species, are, polycarpic, along, with, plants, from, the, closely, related, genera, yucca, hesperoyucca, and, hesperaloe, various, agave, species, are, popular, ornamental, plants, in, hot, dry, climates, as, they, require, very, little, supplemental, water, to, survive, most, agave, species, grow, very, slowly, some, agave, species, are, known, by, the, common, name, century, plant, maguey, is, a, spanish, word, that, refers, to, all, of, the, large, leafed, plants, in, the, asparagaceae, family, including, agaves, and, yuccas, maguey, flowers, are, eaten, in, many, indigenous, culinary, traditions, of, mesoamerica, the, succulent, leaves, of, most, agave, species, have, sharp, marginal, teeth, an, extremely, sharp, terminal, spine, and, are, very, fibrous, inside, the, stout, stem, is, usually, extremely, short, which, may, make, the, plant, appear, as, though, it, is, stemless, agave, rosettes, are, mostly, monocarpic, though, some, species, are, polycarpic, 30, during, flowering, a, tall, stem, or, mast, quiote, in, mexico, which, can, grow, to, be, 12, metres, 40, feet, high, grows, apically, from, the, center, of, the, rosette, and, bears, a, large, number, of, short, tubular, flowers, and, sometimes, vegetatively, produced, bulbils, a, form, of, asexual, reproduction, after, pollination, fertilization, and, subsequent, fruit, development, in, monocarpic, species, the, original, rosette, dies, however, throughout, the, lifetime, of, many, agave, species, rhizomatous, suckers, develop, above, the, roots, at, the, base, of, the, rosette, 30, these, suckers, go, on, to, form, new, plants, after, the, original, rosette, desiccates, and, dies, not, all, agaves, produce, suckers, throughout, their, lifetimes, some, species, rarely, or, never, produce, suckers, while, others, may, only, develop, suckers, after, final, maturation, with, inflorescence, some, varieties, can, live, for, 60, years, before, flowering, agaves, can, be, confused, with, cacti, aloes, or, stonecrops, but, although, these, plants, all, share, similar, morphological, adaptations, to, arid, environments, e, g, succulence, each, group, belongs, to, a, different, plant, family, and, probably, experienced, convergent, evolution, further, cactus, cactaceae, and, stonecrop, crassulaceae, lineages, are, eudicots, while, aloes, asphodelaceae, and, agaves, asparagaceae, are, monocots, the, agave, root, system, consisting, of, a, network, of, shallow, rhizomes, allows, the, agave, to, efficiently, capture, moisture, from, rain, condensation, and, dew, in, addition, to, growing, from, seeds, most, agaves, produce, pups, young, plants, from, runners, agave, vilmoriniana, the, octopus, agave, produces, hundreds, of, pups, on, its, bloom, stalk, agave, leaves, store, the, plant, s, water, and, are, crucial, to, its, continued, existence, the, coated, leaf, surface, prevents, evaporation, the, leaves, also, have, sharp, spiked, edges, the, spikes, discourage, predators, from, eating, the, plant, or, using, it, as, a, source, of, water, and, are, so, tough, that, ancient, peoples, used, them, for, sewing, needles, the, sap, is, acidic, some, agaves, bloom, at, a, height, up, to, 9, m, 30, ft, so, that, they, are, far, out, of, reach, to, animals, that, might, attack, them, smaller, species, such, as, agave, lechuguilla, have, smaller, bloom, stalks, the, genus, name, agave, come, from, the, ancient, greek, agau, from, agau, s, meaning, illustrious, noble, having, to, do, with, very, tall, flower, spikes, found, on, its, many, species, the, genus, agave, was, erected, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1753, initially, with, four, species, the, first, listed, was, agave, americana, now, the, type, species, in, the, cronquist, system, and, others, agave, was, placed, in, the, family, liliaceae, but, phylogenetic, analyses, of, dna, sequences, later, showed, it, did, not, belong, there, in, the, apg, ii, system, agave, was, placed, in, the, segregated, family, agavaceae, when, this, system, was, superseded, by, the, apg, iii, system, in, 2009, the, agavaceae, were, subsumed, into, the, expanded, family, asparagaceae, and, agave, was, treated, as, one, of, 18, genera, in, the, subfamily, agavoideae, a, position, retained, in, the, apg, iv, system, of, 2016, agaves, and, close, relatives, have, long, presented, significant, taxonomic, difficulty, these, difficulties, could, be, due, to, the, relatively, young, evolutionary, age, of, the, group, major, diversification, events, of, the, group, most, likely, occurred, 8, 10, million, years, ago, ease, of, hybridization, between, species, and, even, genera, incomplete, lineage, sorting, and, long, generation, times, within, a, species, morphological, variations, can, be, considerable, especially, in, cultivation, a, number, of, named, species, may, actually, just, be, variants, of, original, wild, type, species, that, horticulturalists, bred, to, appear, unique, in, cultivation, some, commonly, grown, species, include, agave, americana, a, angustifolia, a, attenuata, a, murpheyi, a, palmeri, a, parryi, a, parviflora, a, tequilana, a, victoriae, reginae, and, a, vilmoriniana, one, of, the, most, familiar, species, is, a, americana, a, native, of, tropical, america, common, names, include, century, plant, maguey, in, mexico, or, american, aloe, though, not, related, to, the, genus, aloe, the, name, century, plant, refers, to, the, long, time, the, plant, takes, to, flower, the, number, of, years, before, flowering, occurs, depends, on, the, vigor, of, the, individual, plant, the, richness, of, the, soil, and, the, climate, during, these, years, the, plant, is, storing, in, its, fleshy, leaves, the, nourishment, required, for, the, effort, of, flowering, a, americana, century, plant, was, introduced, into, southern, europe, about, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, and, is, now, naturalized, as, well, as, widely, cultivated, as, an, ornamental, as, it, is, in, the, americas, in, the, variegated, forms, the, leaf, has, a, white, or, yellow, marginal, or, central, stripe, as, the, leaves, unfold, from, the, center, of, the, rosette, the, impression, of, the, marginal, spines, is, conspicuous, on, the, still, erect, younger, leaves, the, plant, is, reported, being, hardy, to, 9, 5, to, 6, 5, c, or, zone, 8b, 15, 20f, being, succulents, they, tend, to, rot, if, kept, too, wet, in, areas, such, as, america, s, pacific, northwest, they, might, be, hardy, for, cold, winter, temperatures, but, need, protection, from, winter, rain, they, mature, very, slowly, and, die, after, flowering, but, are, easily, propagated, by, the, offsets, from, the, base, of, the, stem, a, americana, a, blue, variety, occurs, in, abundance, in, the, karoo, and, arid, highland, regions, of, south, africa, introduced, by, the, british, settlers, in, 1820, the, plant, was, originally, cultivated, and, used, as, emergency, feed, for, livestock, today, it, is, used, mainly, for, the, production, of, syrup, and, sugar, a, attenuata, is, a, native, of, central, mexico, and, is, uncommon, in, its, natural, habitat, unlike, most, species, of, agave, a, attenuata, has, a, curved, flower, spike, from, which, it, derives, one, of, its, numerous, common, names, the, foxtail, agave, it, is, also, commonly, grown, as, a, garden, plant, unlike, many, agaves, a, attenuata, has, no, teeth, or, terminal, spines, making, it, an, ideal, plant, for, areas, adjacent, to, footpaths, like, all, agaves, it, is, a, succulent, and, requires, little, water, or, maintenance, once, established, agave, azul, blue, agave, is, used, in, the, production, of, tequila, it, is, native, to, the, caribbean, as, well, as, many, regions, of, mexico, like, colima, nayarit, jalisco, and, more, in, 2001, the, mexican, government, and, european, union, agreed, upon, the, classification, of, tequila, and, its, categories, all, 100, blue, agave, tequila, must, be, made, from, the, a, tequilana, weber, s, blue, agave, plant, to, rigorous, specifications, and, only, in, the, state, of, jalisco, blue, agave, is, significantly, different, from, other, types, of, agave, because, it, is, higher, in, fructose, and, much, sweeter, compared, to, the, rest, it, is, also, the, primary, source, for, agave, syrup, a, nectary, sweetener, made, for, consumption, agave, species, are, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, butterfly, and, moth, species, including, batrachedra, striolata, which, has, been, recorded, on, a, shawii, some, species, contain, components, in, their, juice, which, can, cause, dermatitis, for, some, people, the, ethnobotany, of, the, agave, was, described, by, william, h, prescott, in, 1843, but, the, miracle, of, nature, was, the, great, mexican, aloe, or, maguey, whose, clustering, pyramids, of, flowers, towering, above, their, dark, coronals, of, leaves, were, seen, sprinkled, over, many, a, broad, acre, of, the, table, land, as, we, have, already, noticed, its, bruised, leaves, afforded, a, paste, from, which, paper, was, manufactured, its, juice, was, fermented, into, an, intoxicating, beverage, pulque, of, which, the, natives, to, this, day, are, extremely, fond, its, leaves, further, supplied, an, impenetrable, thatch, for, the, more, humble, dwellings, thread, of, which, coarse, stuffs, were, made, and, strong, cords, were, drawn, from, its, tough, and, twisted, fibers, pins, and, needles, were, made, from, the, thorns, at, the, extremity, of, its, leaves, and, the, root, when, properly, cooked, was, converted, into, a, palatable, and, nutritious, food, the, agave, in, short, was, meat, drink, clothing, and, writing, materials, for, the, aztec, surely, never, did, nature, enclose, in, so, compact, a, form, so, many, of, the, elements, of, human, comfort, and, civilization, the, four, major, edible, parts, of, the, agave, are, the, flowers, the, leaves, the, stalks, or, basal, rosettes, and, the, sap, in, spanish, aguamiel, meaning, honey, water, the, sap, of, some, species, can, also, be, used, as, soap, each, agave, plant, produces, several, pounds, of, edible, flowers, during, its, final, season, the, stalks, which, are, ready, during, the, summer, before, the, blossom, weigh, several, pounds, each, roasted, they, are, sweet, and, can, be, chewed, to, extract, the, sap, or, aguamiel, like, sugarcane, when, dried, out, the, stalks, can, be, used, to, make, didgeridoos, the, leaves, may, be, collected, in, winter, and, spring, when, the, plants, are, rich, in, sap, for, eating, the, leaves, of, several, species, also, yield, fiber, for, instance, a, sisalana, the, sisal, hemp, and, a, decipiens, the, false, sisal, hemp, a, americana, is, the, source, of, pita, fiber, and, is, used, as, a, fiber, plant, in, mexico, the, west, indies, and, southern, europe, the, agave, especially, a, murpheyi, was, a, major, food, source, for, the, prehistoric, indigenous, people, of, the, southwestern, united, states, the, hohokam, of, southern, arizona, cultivated, large, areas, of, agave, in, southern, california, and, the, baja, california, peninsula, the, roasted, hearts, of, a, shawii, and, a, deserti, were, historically, among, the, most, important, foods, for, the, cahuilla, kumeyaay, kiliwa, and, paipai, peoples, leaving, ubiquitous, archeological, evidence, in, the, form, of, agave, roasting, pits, throughout, the, region, the, navajo, similarly, found, many, uses, for, the, agave, plant, a, beverage, is, squeezed, from, the, baked, fibers, and, the, heads, can, be, baked, or, boiled, pounded, into, flat, sheets, sun, dried, and, stored, for, future, use, the, baked, dried, heads, are, also, boiled, and, made, into, an, edible, paste, eaten, whole, or, made, into, soup, the, leaves, are, eaten, boiled, and, the, young, tender, flowering, stalks, and, shoots, are, roasted, and, eaten, as, well, the, fibers, are, used, to, make, rope, the, leaves, are, used, to, line, baking, pits, and, the, sharp, pointed, leaf, tips, are, used, to, make, basketry, awls, during, the, development, of, the, inflorescence, sap, rushes, to, the, base, of, the, young, flower, stalk, agave, syrup, commonly, called, agave, nectar, a, sweetener, derived, from, the, sap, is, used, as, an, alternative, to, sugar, in, cooking, and, can, be, added, to, breakfast, cereals, as, a, binding, agent, extracts, from, agave, leaves, are, under, preliminary, research, for, their, potential, use, as, food, additives, the, sap, of, a, americana, and, other, species, is, used, in, mexico, and, mesoamerica, to, produce, pulque, an, alcoholic, beverage, the, flower, shoot, is, cut, out, and, the, sap, collected, and, subsequently, fermented, by, distillation, a, spirit, called, mezcal, is, prepared, one, of, the, best, known, forms, of, mezcal, is, tequila, a, tequilana, or, a, tequilana, var, azul, is, used, in, the, production, of, tequila, a, angustifolia, is, widely, used, in, the, production, of, mezcal, and, pulque, though, at, least, 10, other, agave, species, are, also, known, to, be, used, for, this, agave, can, be, used, as, the, raw, material, for, industrial, production, of, fructans, as, a, prebiotic, dietary, fiber, agave, contains, fructooligosaccharides, which, are, naturally, occurring, oligosaccharides, that, support, safely, subjecting, peanut, allergic, people, to, allergen, immunotherapy, resulting, from, its, natural, habitat, in, stressful, environments, agave, is, under, preliminary, research, for, its, potential, use, in, germplasm, conservation, and, in, biotechnology, to, better, anticipate, the, economic, effects, of, global, climate, change, it, may, also, have, use, as, a, bioethanol, or, bioenergy, feedstock,
