triploblasts, lankester, 1873, bilateria, b, a, l, t, r, i, by, l, teer, ee, is, a, large, clade, or, infrakingdom, of, animals, called, bilaterians, b, a, l, t, r, i, n, by, l, teer, ee, n, characterized, by, bilateral, symmetry, i, e, having, a, left, and, a, right, side, that, are, mirror, images, of, each, other, during, embryonic, development, this, means, their, body, plans, are, laid, around, a, longitudinal, axis, rostral, caudal, axis, with, a, front, or, head, and, a, rear, or, tail, end, as, well, as, a, left, right, symmetrical, belly, ventral, and, back, dorsal, surface, nearly, all, bilaterians, maintain, a, bilaterally, symmetrical, body, as, adults, the, most, notable, exception, is, the, echinoderms, which, extend, to, pentaradial, symmetry, as, adults, but, are, only, bilaterally, symmetrical, as, an, embryo, cephalization, is, also, a, characteristic, feature, among, most, bilaterians, where, the, special, sense, organs, and, central, nerve, ganglia, become, concentrated, at, the, front, rostral, end, bilaterians, constitute, one, of, the, five, main, metazoan, lineages, the, other, four, being, porifera, sponges, cnidaria, jellyfish, hydrae, sea, anemones, and, corals, ctenophora, comb, jellies, and, placozoa, tiny, flat, animals, for, the, most, part, bilateral, embryos, are, triploblastic, having, three, germ, layers, endoderm, mesoderm, and, ectoderm, except, for, a, few, phyla, i, e, flatworms, and, gnathostomulids, bilaterians, have, complete, digestive, tracts, with, a, separate, mouth, and, anus, some, bilaterians, lack, body, cavities, acoelomates, i, e, platyhelminthes, gastrotricha, and, gnathostomulida, while, others, display, primary, body, cavities, deriving, from, the, blastocoel, as, pseudocoeloms, or, secondary, cavities, that, appear, de, novo, for, example, the, coelom, some, of, the, earliest, bilaterians, were, wormlike, and, a, bilaterian, body, can, be, conceptualized, as, a, cylinder, with, a, gut, running, between, two, openings, the, mouth, and, the, anus, around, the, gut, it, has, an, internal, body, cavity, a, coelom, or, pseudocoelom, animals, with, this, bilaterally, symmetric, body, plan, have, a, head, anterior, end, and, a, tail, posterior, end, as, well, as, a, back, dorsal, and, a, belly, ventral, therefore, they, also, have, a, left, side, and, a, right, side, having, a, front, end, means, that, this, part, of, the, body, encounters, stimuli, such, as, food, favouring, cephalisation, the, development, of, a, head, with, sense, organs, and, a, mouth, the, body, stretches, back, from, the, head, and, many, bilaterians, have, a, combination, of, circular, muscles, that, constrict, the, body, making, it, longer, and, an, opposing, set, of, longitudinal, muscles, that, shorten, the, body, these, enable, soft, bodied, animals, with, a, hydrostatic, skeleton, to, move, by, peristalsis, most, bilaterians, nephrozoans, have, a, gut, that, extends, through, the, body, from, mouth, to, anus, while, xenacoelomorphs, have, a, bag, gut, with, one, opening, many, bilaterian, phyla, have, primary, larvae, which, swim, with, cilia, and, have, an, apical, organ, containing, sensory, cells, however, there, are, exceptions, to, each, of, these, characteristics, for, example, adult, echinoderms, are, radially, symmetric, unlike, their, larvae, and, certain, parasitic, worms, have, extremely, plesiomorphic, body, structures, the, hypothetical, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, all, bilateria, is, termed, the, urbilaterian, the, nature, of, the, first, bilaterian, is, a, matter, of, debate, one, side, suggests, that, acoelomates, gave, rise, to, the, other, groups, planuloid, aceloid, hypothesis, by, ludwig, von, graff, elie, metchnikoff, libbie, hyman, or, luitfried, von, salvini, plawen, while, the, other, poses, that, the, first, bilaterian, was, a, coelomate, organism, and, the, main, acoelomate, phyla, flatworms, and, gastrotrichs, have, lost, body, cavities, secondarily, the, archicoelomata, hypothesis, and, its, variations, such, as, the, gastrea, by, haeckel, or, sedgwick, the, bilaterosgastrea, by, g, sta, j, gersten, or, the, trochaea, by, nielsen, one, hypothesis, is, that, the, original, bilaterian, was, a, bottom, dwelling, worm, with, a, single, body, opening, similar, to, xenoturbella, alternatively, it, may, have, resembled, the, planula, larvae, of, some, cnidaria, which, have, some, bilateral, symmetry, however, there, is, evidence, that, it, was, segmented, as, the, mechanism, for, creating, segments, is, shared, between, vertebrates, deuterostomes, and, arthropods, protostomes, the, first, evidence, of, bilateria, in, the, fossil, record, comes, from, trace, fossils, in, ediacaran, sediments, and, the, first, bona, fide, bilaterian, fossil, is, kimberella, dating, to, 555, million, years, ago, earlier, fossils, are, controversial, the, fossil, vernanimalcula, may, be, the, earliest, known, bilaterian, but, may, also, represent, an, infilled, bubble, fossil, embryos, are, known, from, around, the, time, of, vernanimalcula, 580, million, years, ago, but, none, of, these, have, bilaterian, affinities, burrows, believed, to, have, been, created, by, bilaterian, life, forms, have, been, found, in, the, tacuar, formation, of, uruguay, and, were, believed, to, be, at, least, 585, million, years, old, however, more, recent, evidence, shows, these, fossils, are, actually, late, paleozoic, instead, of, ediacaran, the, bilateria, has, traditionally, been, divided, into, two, main, lineages, or, superphyla, the, deuterostomes, traditionally, include, the, echinoderms, hemichordates, chordates, and, the, extinct, vetulicolia, the, protostomes, include, most, of, the, rest, such, as, arthropods, annelids, mollusks, flatworms, and, so, forth, there, are, several, differences, most, notably, in, how, the, embryo, develops, in, particular, the, first, opening, of, the, embryo, becomes, the, mouth, in, protostomes, and, the, anus, in, deuterostomes, many, taxonomists, now, recognize, at, least, two, more, superphyla, among, the, protostomes, ecdysozoa, molting, animals, and, spiralia, the, arrow, worms, chaetognatha, have, proven, difficult, to, classify, recent, studies, place, them, in, the, gnathifera, the, traditional, division, of, bilateria, into, deuterostomia, and, protostomia, was, challenged, when, new, morphological, and, molecular, evidence, found, support, for, a, sister, relationship, between, the, acoelomate, taxa, acoela, and, nemertodermatida, together, called, acoelomorpha, and, the, remaining, bilaterians, the, latter, clade, was, called, nephrozoa, by, jondelius, et, al, 2002, and, eubilateria, by, bagu, a, and, riutort, 2004, the, acoelomorph, taxa, had, previously, been, considered, flatworms, with, secondarily, lost, characteristics, but, the, new, relationship, suggested, that, the, simple, acoelomate, worm, form, was, the, original, bilaterian, body, plan, and, that, the, coelom, the, digestive, tract, excretory, organs, and, nerve, cords, developed, in, the, nephrozoa, subsequently, the, acoelomorphs, were, placed, in, phylum, xenacoelomorpha, together, with, the, xenoturbellids, and, the, sister, relationship, between, xenacoelomorpha, and, nephrozoa, confirmed, in, phylogenomic, analyses, a, modern, consensus, phylogenetic, tree, for, bilateria, is, shown, below, although, the, positions, of, certain, clades, are, still, controversial, dashed, lines, and, the, tree, has,

forming, the, xenambulacraria, the, xenambulacraria, may, be, sister, to, the, chordata, or, to, the, centroneuralia, corresponding, to, nephrozoa, without, ambulacraria, or, to, chordata, protostomia, the, phylogenetic, tree, shown, below, depicts, the, latter, proposal, also, the, validity, of, deuterostomia, without, protostomia, emerging, from, it, is, under, discussion, the, cladogram, indicates, approximately, when, some, clades, radiated, into, newer, clades, in, millions, of, years, ago, mya, while, the, below, tree, depicts, chordata, as, a, sister, group, to, protostomia, according, to, analyses, by, philippe, et, al, the, authors, nonetheless, caution, that, the, support, values, are, very, low, meaning, there, is, no, solid, evidence, to, refute, the,
