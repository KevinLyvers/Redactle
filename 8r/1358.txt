dementia, is, a, syndrome, associated, with, many, neurodegenerative, diseases, characterized, by, a, general, decline, in, cognitive, abilities, that, affects, a, person, s, ability, to, perform, everyday, activities, this, typically, involves, problems, with, memory, thinking, behavior, and, motor, control, aside, from, memory, impairment, and, a, disruption, in, thought, patterns, the, most, common, symptoms, of, dementia, include, emotional, problems, difficulties, with, language, and, decreased, motivation, the, symptoms, may, be, described, as, occurring, in, a, continuum, over, several, stages, dementia, ultimately, has, a, significant, effect, on, the, individual, their, caregivers, and, their, social, relationships, in, general, a, diagnosis, of, dementia, requires, the, observation, of, a, change, from, a, person, s, usual, mental, functioning, and, a, greater, cognitive, decline, than, might, be, caused, by, the, normal, aging, process, several, diseases, and, injuries, to, the, brain, such, as, a, stroke, can, give, rise, to, dementia, however, the, most, common, cause, is, alzheimer, s, disease, a, neurodegenerative, disorder, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, fifth, edition, dsm, 5, has, re, described, dementia, as, a, mild, or, major, neurocognitive, disorder, with, varying, degrees, of, severity, and, many, causative, subtypes, the, international, classification, of, diseases, icd, 11, also, classifies, dementia, as, a, neurocognitive, disorder, ncd, with, many, forms, or, subclasses, dementia, is, listed, as, an, acquired, brain, syndrome, marked, by, a, decline, in, cognitive, function, and, is, contrasted, with, neurodevelopmental, disorders, it, is, also, described, as, a, spectrum, of, disorders, with, causative, subtypes, of, dementia, based, on, a, known, disorder, such, as, parkinson, s, disease, for, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, huntington, s, disease, for, huntington, s, disease, dementia, vascular, disease, for, vascular, dementia, hiv, infection, causing, hiv, dementia, frontotemporal, lobar, degeneration, for, frontotemporal, dementia, lewy, body, disease, for, dementia, with, lewy, bodies, and, prion, diseases, subtypes, of, neurodegenerative, dementias, may, also, be, based, on, the, underlying, pathology, of, misfolded, proteins, such, as, synucleinopathies, and, tauopathies, the, coexistence, of, more, than, one, type, of, dementia, is, known, as, mixed, dementia, many, neurocognitive, disorders, may, be, caused, by, another, medical, condition, or, disorder, including, brain, tumours, and, subdural, hematoma, endocrine, disorders, such, as, hypothyroidism, and, hypoglycemia, nutritional, deficiencies, including, thiamine, and, niacin, infections, immune, disorders, liver, or, kidney, failure, metabolic, disorders, such, as, kufs, disease, some, leukodystrophies, and, neurological, disorders, such, as, epilepsy, and, multiple, sclerosis, some, of, the, neurocognitive, deficits, may, sometimes, show, improvement, with, treatment, of, the, causative, medical, condition, diagnosis, of, dementia, is, usually, based, on, history, of, the, illness, and, cognitive, testing, with, imaging, blood, tests, may, be, taken, to, rule, out, other, possible, causes, that, may, be, reversible, such, as, hypothyroidism, an, underactive, thyroid, and, to, determine, the, dementia, subtype, one, commonly, used, cognitive, test, is, the, mini, mental, state, examination, although, the, greatest, risk, factor, for, developing, dementia, is, aging, dementia, is, not, a, normal, part, of, the, aging, process, many, people, aged, 90, and, above, show, no, signs, of, dementia, several, risk, factors, for, dementia, such, as, smoking, and, obesity, are, preventable, by, lifestyle, changes, screening, the, general, older, population, for, the, disorder, is, not, seen, to, affect, the, outcome, dementia, is, currently, the, seventh, leading, cause, of, death, worldwide, and, has, 10, million, new, cases, reported, every, year, approximately, one, every, three, seconds, there, is, no, known, cure, for, dementia, acetylcholinesterase, inhibitors, such, as, donepezil, are, often, used, and, may, be, beneficial, in, mild, to, moderate, disorder, but, the, overall, benefit, may, be, minor, there, are, many, measures, that, can, improve, the, quality, of, life, of, a, person, with, dementia, and, their, caregivers, cognitive, and, behavioral, interventions, may, be, appropriate, for, treating, the, associated, symptoms, of, depression, the, signs, and, symptoms, of, dementia, are, termed, as, the, neuropsychiatric, symptoms, also, known, as, the, behavioral, and, psychological, symptoms, of, dementia, the, behavioral, symptoms, can, include, agitation, restlessness, inappropriate, behavior, sexual, disinhibition, and, verbal, or, physical, aggression, these, symptoms, may, result, from, impairments, in, cognitive, inhibition, the, psychological, symptoms, can, include, depression, hallucinations, most, often, visual, delusions, apathy, and, anxiety, the, most, commonly, affected, areas, of, brain, function, include, memory, language, attention, problem, solving, and, visuospatial, function, affecting, perception, and, orientation, the, symptoms, progress, at, a, continuous, rate, over, several, stages, and, they, vary, across, the, dementia, subtypes, most, types, of, dementia, are, slowly, progressive, with, some, deterioration, of, the, brain, well, established, before, signs, of, the, disorder, become, apparent, there, are, often, other, conditions, present, such, as, high, blood, pressure, or, diabetes, and, there, can, sometimes, be, as, many, as, four, of, these, comorbidities, signs, of, dementia, include, getting, lost, in, a, familiar, neighborhood, using, unusual, words, to, refer, to, familiar, objects, forgetting, the, name, of, a, close, family, member, or, friend, forgetting, old, memories, and, being, unable, to, complete, tasks, independently, people, with, developing, dementia, often, fall, behind, on, bill, payments, specifically, mortgage, and, credit, cards, and, a, crashing, credit, score, can, be, an, early, indicator, of, the, disease, people, with, dementia, are, more, likely, to, have, problems, with, incontinence, than, those, of, a, comparable, age, without, dementia, they, are, three, times, more, likely, to, have, urinary, incontinence, and, four, times, more, likely, to, have, fecal, incontinence, the, course, of, dementia, is, often, described, in, four, stages, pre, dementia, early, middle, and, late, that, show, a, pattern, of, progressive, cognitive, and, functional, impairment, more, detailed, descriptions, can, be, arrived, at, by, the, use, of, numeric, scales, these, scales, include, the, global, deterioration, scale, for, assessment, of, primary, degenerative, dementia, gds, or, reisberg, scale, the, functional, assessment, staging, test, fast, and, the, clinical, dementia, rating, cdr, using, the, gds, which, more, accurately, identifies, each, stage, of, the, disease, progression, a, more, detailed, course, is, described, in, seven, stages, two, of, which, are, broken, down, further, into, five, and, six, degrees, stage, 7, f, is, the, final, stage, pre, dementia, includes, pre, clinical, and, prodromal, stages, the, latter, stage, includes, mild, cognitive, impairment, mci, delirium, onset, and, psychiatric, onset, presentations, sensory, dysfunction, is, claimed, for, the, pre, clinical, stage, which, may, precede, the, first, clinical, signs, of, dementia, by, up, to, ten, years, most, notably, the, sense, of, smell, is, lost, associated, with, depression, and, a, loss, of, appetite, leading, to, poor, nutrition, it, is, suggested, that, this, dysfunction, may, come, about, because, the, olfactory, epithelium, is, exposed, to, the, environment, and, the, lack, of, blood, brain, barrier, protection, allows, toxic, elements, to, enter, and, cause, damage, to, the, chemosensory, networks, pre, dementia, states, considered, as, prodromal, are, mild, cognitive, impairment, mci, and, mild, behavioral, impairment, mbi, kynurenine, is, a, metabolite, of, tryptophan, that, regulates, microbiome, signalling, immune, cell, response, and, neuronal, excitation, a, disruption, in, the, kynurenine, pathway, may, be, associated, with, the, neuropsychiatric, symptoms, and, cognitive, prognosis, in, mild, dementia, signs, and, symptoms, at, the, prodromal, stage, may, be, subtle, and, the, early, signs, often, become, apparent, only, in, hindsight, of, those, diagnosed, with, mci, 70, later, progress, to, dementia, in, mci, changes, in, the, person, s, brain, have, been, happening, for, a, long, time, but, the, symptoms, are, just, beginning, to, appear, these, problems, however, are, not, severe, enough, to, affect, daily, function, if, and, when, they, do, the, diagnosis, becomes, dementia, the, person, may, have, some, memory, problems, and, trouble, finding, words, but, they, can, solve, everyday, problems, and, competently, handle, their, life, affairs, during, this, stage, it, is, ideal, to, ensure, that, advance, care, planning, has, occurred, to, protect, the, person, s, wishes, advance, directives, exist, that, are, specific, to, sufferers, of, dementia, these, can, be, particularly, helpful, in, addressing, the, decisions, related, to, feeding, which, come, with, the, progression, of, the, illness, mci, has, been, relisted, in, both, dsm, 5, and, icd, 11, as, mild, neurocognitive, disorders, i, e, milder, forms, of, the, major, neurocognitive, disorder, dementia, subtypes, in, the, early, stage, of, dementia, symptoms, become, noticeable, to, other, people, in, addition, the, symptoms, begin, to, interfere, with, daily, activities, and, will, register, a, score, on, a, mini, mental, state, examination, mmse, mmse, scores, are, set, at, 24, to, 30, for, a, normal, cognitive, rating, and, lower, scores, reflect, severity, of, symptoms, the, symptoms, are, dependent, on, the, type, of, dementia, more, complicated, chores, and, tasks, around, the, house, or, at, work, become, more, difficult, the, person, can, usually, still, take, care, of, themselves, but, may, forget, things, like, taking, pills, or, doing, laundry, and, may, need, prompting, or, reminders, the, symptoms, of, early, dementia, usually, include, memory, difficulty, but, can, also, include, some, word, finding, problems, and, problems, with, executive, functions, of, planning, and, organization, managing, finances, may, prove, difficult, other, signs, might, be, getting, lost, in, new, places, repeating, things, and, personality, changes, in, some, types, of, dementia, such, as, dementia, with, lewy, bodies, and, frontotemporal, dementia, personality, changes, and, difficulty, with, organization, and, planning, may, be, the, first, signs, as, dementia, progresses, initial, symptoms, generally, worsen, the, rate, of, decline, is, different, for, each, person, mmse, scores, between, 6, 17, signal, moderate, dementia, for, example, people, with, moderate, alzheimer, s, dementia, lose, almost, all, new, information, people, with, dementia, may, be, severely, impaired, in, solving, problems, and, their, social, judgment, is, often, impaired, they, cannot, usually, function, outside, their, own, home, and, generally, should, not, be, left, alone, they, may, be, able, to, do, simple, chores, around, the, house, but, not, much, else, and, begin, to, require, assistance, for, personal, care, and, hygiene, beyond, simple, reminders, a, lack, of, insight, into, having, the, condition, will, become, evident, people, with, late, stage, dementia, typically, turn, increasingly, inward, and, need, assistance, with, most, or, all, of, their, personal, care, people, with, dementia, in, the, late, stages, usually, need, 24, hour, supervision, to, ensure, their, personal, safety, and, meeting, of, basic, needs, if, left, unsupervised, they, may, wander, or, fall, may, not, recognize, common, dangers, such, as, a, hot, stove, or, may, not, realize, that, they, need, to, use, the, bathroom, and, become, incontinent, they, may, not, want, to, get, out, of, bed, or, may, need, assistance, doing, so, commonly, the, person, no, longer, recognizes, familiar, faces, they, may, have, significant, changes, in, sleeping, habits, or, have, trouble, sleeping, at, all, changes, in, eating, frequently, occur, cognitive, awareness, is, needed, for, eating, and, swallowing, and, progressive, cognitive, decline, results, in, eating, and, swallowing, difficulties, this, can, cause, food, to, be, refused, or, choked, on, and, help, with, feeding, will, often, be, required, for, ease, of, feeding, food, may, be, liquidized, into, a, thick, pur, e, they, may, also, struggle, to, walk, particularly, among, those, with, alzheimer, s, disease, in, some, cases, terminal, lucidity, a, form, of, paradoxical, lucidity, occurs, immediately, before, death, in, this, phenomenon, there, is, an, unexpected, recovery, of, mental, clarity, many, causes, of, dementia, are, neurodegenerative, and, protein, misfolding, is, a, cardinal, feature, of, these, other, common, causes, include, vascular, dementia, dementia, with, lewy, bodies, frontotemporal, dementia, and, mixed, dementia, commonly, alzheimer, s, disease, and, vascular, dementia, less, common, causes, include, normal, pressure, hydrocephalus, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, syphilis, hiv, and, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, alzheimer, s, disease, accounts, for, 60, 70, of, cases, of, dementia, worldwide, the, most, common, symptoms, of, alzheimer, s, disease, are, short, term, memory, loss, and, word, finding, difficulties, trouble, with, visuospatial, functioning, getting, lost, often, reasoning, judgment, and, insight, fail, insight, refers, to, whether, or, not, the, person, realizes, they, have, memory, problems, the, part, of, the, brain, most, affected, by, alzheimer, s, is, the, hippocampus, other, parts, that, show, atrophy, shrinking, include, the, temporal, and, parietal, lobes, although, this, pattern, of, brain, shrinkage, suggests, alzheimer, s, it, is, variable, and, a, brain, scan, is, insufficient, for, a, diagnosis, little, is, known, about, the, events, that, occur, during, and, that, actually, cause, alzheimer, s, disease, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, brain, tissue, from, patients, with, the, disease, can, only, be, studied, after, the, person, s, death, however, it, is, known, that, one, of, the, first, aspects, of, the, disease, is, a, dysfunction, in, the, gene, that, produces, amyloid, extracellular, senile, plaques, sps, consisting, of, beta, amyloid, a, peptides, and, intracellular, neurofibrillary, tangles, nfts, that, are, formed, by, hyperphosphorylated, tau, proteins, are, two, well, established, pathological, hallmarks, of, ad, amyloid, causes, inflammation, around, the, senile, plaques, of, the, brain, and, too, much, build, up, of, this, inflammation, leads, to, changes, in, the, brain, that, cannot, be, controlled, leading, to, the, symptoms, of, alzheimer, s, several, articles, have, been, published, on, a, possible, relationship, as, an, either, primary, cause, or, exacerbation, of, alzheimer, s, disease, between, general, anesthesia, and, alzheimer, s, in, specifically, the, elderly, vascular, dementia, accounts, for, at, least, 20, of, dementia, cases, making, it, the, second, most, common, type, it, is, caused, by, disease, or, injury, affecting, the, blood, supply, to, the, brain, typically, involving, a, series, of, mini, strokes, the, symptoms, of, this, dementia, depend, on, where, in, the, brain, the, strokes, occurred, and, whether, the, blood, vessels, affected, were, large, or, small, repeated, injury, can, cause, progressive, dementia, over, time, while, a, single, injury, located, in, an, area, critical, for, cognition, such, as, the, hippocampus, or, thalamus, can, lead, to, sudden, cognitive, decline, elements, of, vascular, dementia, may, be, present, in, all, other, forms, of, dementia, brain, scans, may, show, evidence, of, multiple, strokes, of, different, sizes, in, various, locations, people, with, vascular, dementia, tend, to, have, risk, factors, for, disease, of, the, blood, vessels, such, as, tobacco, use, high, blood, pressure, atrial, fibrillation, high, cholesterol, diabetes, or, other, signs, of, vascular, disease, such, as, a, previous, heart, attack, or, angina, the, prodromal, symptoms, of, dementia, with, lewy, bodies, dlb, include, mild, cognitive, impairment, and, delirium, onset, the, symptoms, of, dlb, are, more, frequent, more, severe, and, earlier, presenting, than, in, the, other, dementia, subtypes, dementia, with, lewy, bodies, has, the, primary, symptoms, of, fluctuating, cognition, alertness, or, attention, rem, sleep, behavior, disorder, rbd, one, or, more, of, the, main, features, of, parkinsonism, not, due, to, medication, or, stroke, and, repeated, visual, hallucinations, the, visual, hallucinations, in, dlb, are, generally, vivid, hallucinations, of, people, or, animals, and, they, often, occur, when, someone, is, about, to, fall, asleep, or, wake, up, other, prominent, symptoms, include, problems, with, planning, executive, function, and, difficulty, with, visual, spatial, function, and, disruption, in, autonomic, bodily, functions, abnormal, sleep, behaviors, may, begin, before, cognitive, decline, is, observed, and, are, a, core, feature, of, dlb, rbd, is, diagnosed, either, by, sleep, study, recording, or, when, sleep, studies, cannot, be, performed, by, medical, history, and, validated, questionnaires, parkinson, s, disease, is, associated, with, lewy, body, dementia, that, often, progresses, to, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, following, a, period, of, dementia, free, parkinson, s, disease, frontotemporal, dementias, ftds, are, characterized, by, drastic, personality, changes, and, language, difficulties, in, all, ftds, the, person, has, a, relatively, early, social, withdrawal, and, early, lack, of, insight, memory, problems, are, not, a, main, feature, there, are, six, main, types, of, ftd, the, first, has, major, symptoms, in, personality, and, behavior, this, is, called, behavioral, variant, ftd, bv, ftd, and, is, the, most, common, the, hallmark, feature, of, bv, ftd, is, impulsive, behavior, and, this, can, be, detected, in, pre, dementia, states, in, bv, ftd, the, person, shows, a, change, in, personal, hygiene, becomes, rigid, in, their, thinking, and, rarely, acknowledges, problems, they, are, socially, withdrawn, and, often, have, a, drastic, increase, in, appetite, they, may, become, socially, inappropriate, for, example, they, may, make, inappropriate, sexual, comments, or, may, begin, using, pornography, openly, one, of, the, most, common, signs, is, apathy, or, not, caring, about, anything, apathy, however, is, a, common, symptom, in, many, dementias, two, types, of, ftd, feature, aphasia, language, problems, as, the, main, symptom, one, type, is, called, semantic, variant, primary, progressive, aphasia, sv, ppa, the, main, feature, of, this, is, the, loss, of, the, meaning, of, words, it, may, begin, with, difficulty, naming, things, the, person, eventually, may, lose, the, meaning, of, objects, as, well, for, example, a, drawing, of, a, bird, dog, and, an, airplane, in, someone, with, ftd, may, all, appear, almost, the, same, in, a, classic, test, for, this, a, patient, is, shown, a, picture, of, a, pyramid, and, below, it, a, picture, of, both, a, palm, tree, and, a, pine, tree, the, person, is, asked, to, say, which, one, goes, best, with, the, pyramid, in, sv, ppa, the, person, cannot, answer, that, question, the, other, type, is, called, non, fluent, agrammatic, variant, primary, progressive, aphasia, nfa, ppa, this, is, mainly, a, problem, with, producing, speech, they, have, trouble, finding, the, right, words, but, mostly, they, have, a, difficulty, coordinating, the, muscles, they, need, to, speak, eventually, someone, with, nfa, ppa, only, uses, one, syllable, words, or, may, become, totally, mute, a, frontotemporal, dementia, associated, with, amyotrophic, lateral, sclerosis, als, known, as, ftd, als, includes, the, symptoms, of, ftd, behavior, language, and, movement, problems, co, occurring, with, amyotrophic, lateral, sclerosis, loss, of, motor, neurons, two, ftd, related, disorders, are, progressive, supranuclear, palsy, also, classed, as, a, parkinson, plus, syndrome, and, corticobasal, degeneration, these, disorders, are, tau, associated, huntington, s, disease, is, a, neurodegenerative, disease, caused, by, mutations, in, a, single, gene, htt, that, encodes, for, huntingtin, protein, symptoms, include, cognitive, impairment, and, this, usually, declines, further, into, dementia, the, first, main, symptoms, of, huntington, s, disease, often, include, hiv, associated, dementia, results, as, a, late, stage, from, hiv, infection, and, mostly, affects, younger, people, the, essential, features, of, hiv, associated, dementia, are, disabling, cognitive, impairment, accompanied, by, motor, dysfunction, speech, problems, and, behavioral, change, cognitive, impairment, is, characterised, by, mental, slowness, trouble, with, memory, and, poor, concentration, motor, symptoms, include, a, loss, of, fine, motor, control, leading, to, clumsiness, poor, balance, and, tremors, behavioral, changes, may, include, apathy, lethargy, and, diminished, emotional, responses, and, spontaneity, histopathologically, it, is, identified, by, the, infiltration, of, monocytes, and, macrophages, into, the, central, nervous, system, cns, gliosis, pallor, of, myelin, sheaths, abnormalities, of, dendritic, processes, and, neuronal, loss, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, is, a, rapidly, progressive, prion, disease, that, typically, causes, dementia, that, worsens, over, weeks, to, months, prions, are, disease, causing, pathogens, created, from, abnormal, proteins, alcohol, related, dementia, also, called, alcohol, related, brain, damage, occurs, as, a, result, of, excessive, use, of, alcohol, particularly, as, a, substance, abuse, disorder, different, factors, can, be, involved, in, this, development, including, thiamine, deficiency, and, age, vulnerability, a, degree, of, brain, damage, is, seen, in, more, than, 70, of, those, with, alcohol, use, disorder, brain, regions, affected, are, similar, to, those, that, are, affected, by, aging, and, also, by, alzheimer, s, disease, regions, showing, loss, of, volume, include, the, frontal, temporal, and, parietal, lobes, as, well, as, the, cerebellum, thalamus, and, hippocampus, this, loss, can, be, more, notable, with, greater, cognitive, impairments, seen, in, those, aged, 65, years, and, older, more, than, one, type, of, dementia, known, as, mixed, dementia, may, exist, together, in, about, 10, of, dementia, cases, the, most, common, type, of, mixed, dementia, is, alzheimer, s, disease, and, vascular, dementia, this, particular, type, of, mixed, dementia, s, main, onsets, are, a, mixture, of, old, age, high, blood, pressure, and, damage, to, blood, vessels, in, the, brain, diagnosis, of, mixed, dementia, can, be, difficult, as, often, only, one, type, will, predominate, this, makes, the, treatment, of, people, with, mixed, dementia, uncommon, with, many, people, missing, out, on, potentially, helpful, treatments, mixed, dementia, can, mean, that, symptoms, onset, earlier, and, worsen, more, quickly, since, more, parts, of, the, brain, will, be, affected, chronic, inflammatory, conditions, that, may, affect, the, brain, and, cognition, include, beh, et, s, disease, multiple, sclerosis, sarcoidosis, sj, gren, s, syndrome, lupus, celiac, disease, and, non, celiac, gluten, sensitivity, these, types, of, dementias, can, rapidly, progress, but, usually, have, a, good, response, to, early, treatment, this, consists, of, immunomodulators, or, steroid, administration, or, in, certain, cases, the, elimination, of, the, causative, agent, a, 2019, review, found, no, association, between, celiac, disease, and, dementia, overall, but, a, potential, association, with, vascular, dementia, a, 2018, review, found, a, link, between, celiac, disease, or, non, celiac, gluten, sensitivity, and, cognitive, impairment, and, that, celiac, disease, may, be, associated, with, alzheimer, s, disease, vascular, dementia, and, frontotemporal, dementia, a, strict, gluten, free, diet, started, early, may, protect, against, dementia, associated, with, gluten, related, disorders, cases, of, easily, reversible, dementia, include, hypothyroidism, vitamin, b, 12, deficiency, lyme, disease, and, neurosyphilis, for, lyme, disease, and, neurosyphilis, testing, should, be, done, if, risk, factors, are, present, because, risk, factors, are, often, difficult, to, determine, testing, for, neurosyphilis, and, lyme, disease, as, well, as, other, mentioned, factors, may, be, undertaken, as, a, matter, of, course, where, dementia, is, suspected, 31, 32, many, other, medical, and, neurological, conditions, include, dementia, only, late, in, the, illness, for, example, a, proportion, of, patients, with, parkinson, s, disease, develop, dementia, though, widely, varying, figures, are, quoted, for, this, proportion, when, dementia, occurs, in, parkinson, s, disease, the, underlying, cause, may, be, dementia, with, lewy, bodies, or, alzheimer, s, disease, or, both, cognitive, impairment, also, occurs, in, the, parkinson, plus, syndromes, of, progressive, supranuclear, palsy, and, corticobasal, degeneration, and, the, same, underlying, pathology, may, cause, the, clinical, syndromes, of, frontotemporal, lobar, degeneration, although, the, acute, porphyrias, may, cause, episodes, of, confusion, and, psychiatric, disturbance, dementia, is, a, rare, feature, of, these, rare, diseases, limbic, predominant, age, related, tdp, 43, encephalopathy, late, is, a, type, of, dementia, that, primarily, affects, people, in, their, 80s, or, 90s, and, in, which, tdp, 43, protein, deposits, in, the, limbic, portion, of, the, brain, hereditary, disorders, that, can, also, cause, dementia, include, some, metabolic, disorders, such, as, lysosomal, storage, disorders, leukodystrophies, and, spinocerebellar, ataxias, symptoms, are, similar, across, dementia, types, and, it, is, difficult, to, diagnose, by, symptoms, alone, diagnosis, may, be, aided, by, brain, scanning, techniques, in, many, cases, the, diagnosis, requires, a, brain, biopsy, to, become, final, but, this, is, rarely, recommended, though, it, can, be, performed, at, autopsy, in, those, who, are, getting, older, general, screening, for, cognitive, impairment, using, cognitive, testing, or, early, diagnosis, of, dementia, has, not, been, shown, to, improve, outcomes, however, screening, exams, are, useful, in, 65, persons, with, memory, complaints, normally, symptoms, must, be, present, for, at, least, six, months, to, support, a, diagnosis, cognitive, dysfunction, of, shorter, duration, is, called, delirium, delirium, can, be, easily, confused, with, dementia, due, to, similar, symptoms, delirium, is, characterized, by, a, sudden, onset, fluctuating, course, a, short, duration, often, lasting, from, hours, to, weeks, and, is, primarily, related, to, a, somatic, or, medical, disturbance, in, comparison, dementia, has, typically, a, long, slow, onset, except, in, the, cases, of, a, stroke, or, trauma, slow, decline, of, mental, functioning, as, well, as, a, longer, trajectory, from, months, to, years, some, mental, illnesses, including, depression, and, psychosis, may, produce, symptoms, that, must, be, differentiated, from, both, delirium, and, dementia, these, are, differently, diagnosed, as, pseudodementias, and, any, dementia, evaluation, needs, to, include, a, depression, screening, such, as, the, neuropsychiatric, inventory, or, the, geriatric, depression, scale, physicians, used, to, think, that, people, with, memory, complaints, had, depression, and, not, dementia, because, they, thought, that, those, with, dementia, are, generally, unaware, of, their, memory, problems, however, researchers, have, realized, that, many, older, people, with, memory, complaints, in, fact, have, mild, cognitive, impairment, the, earliest, stage, of, dementia, depression, should, always, remain, high, on, the, list, of, possibilities, however, for, an, elderly, person, with, memory, trouble, changes, in, thinking, hearing, and, vision, are, associated, with, normal, ageing, and, can, cause, problems, when, diagnosing, dementia, due, to, the, similarities, given, the, challenging, nature, of, predicting, the, onset, of, dementia, and, making, a, dementia, diagnosis, clinical, decision, making, aids, underpinned, by, machine, learning, and, artificial, intelligence, have, the, potential, to, enhance, clinical, practice, various, brief, cognitive, tests, 5, 15, minutes, have, reasonable, reliability, to, screen, for, dementia, but, may, be, affected, by, factors, such, as, age, education, and, ethnicity, age, and, education, have, a, significant, influence, on, the, diagnosis, of, dementia, for, example, individuals, with, lower, education, are, more, likely, to, be, diagnosed, with, dementia, than, their, educated, counterparts, while, many, tests, have, been, studied, presently, the, mini, mental, state, examination, mmse, is, the, best, studied, and, most, commonly, used, the, mmse, is, a, useful, tool, for, helping, to, diagnose, dementia, if, the, results, are, interpreted, along, with, an, assessment, of, a, person, s, personality, their, ability, to, perform, activities, of, daily, living, and, their, behaviour, other, cognitive, tests, include, the, abbreviated, mental, test, score, amts, the, modified, mini, mental, state, examination, 3ms, the, cognitive, abilities, screening, instrument, casi, the, trail, making, test, and, the, clock, drawing, test, the, moca, montreal, cognitive, assessment, is, a, reliable, screening, test, and, is, available, online, for, free, in, 35, different, languages, the, moca, has, also, been, shown, somewhat, better, at, detecting, mild, cognitive, impairment, than, the, mmse, people, with, hearing, loss, which, commonly, occurs, alongside, dementia, score, worse, in, the, moca, test, which, could, lead, to, a, false, diagnosis, of, dementia, researchers, have, developed, an, adapted, version, of, the, moca, test, which, is, accurate, and, reliable, and, avoids, the, need, for, people, to, listen, and, respond, to, questions, the, ad, 8, a, screening, questionnaire, used, to, assess, changes, in, function, related, to, cognitive, decline, is, potentially, useful, but, is, not, diagnostic, is, variable, and, has, risk, of, bias, an, integrated, cognitive, assessment, cognica, is, a, five, minute, test, that, is, highly, sensitive, to, the, early, stages, of, dementia, and, uses, an, application, deliverable, to, an, ipad, previously, in, use, in, the, uk, in, 2021, cognica, was, given, fda, approval, for, its, commercial, use, as, a, medical, device, another, approach, to, screening, for, dementia, is, to, ask, an, informant, relative, or, other, supporter, to, fill, out, a, questionnaire, about, the, person, s, everyday, cognitive, functioning, informant, questionnaires, provide, complementary, information, to, brief, cognitive, tests, probably, the, best, known, questionnaire, of, this, sort, is, the, informant, questionnaire, on, cognitive, decline, in, the, elderly, iqcode, evidence, is, insufficient, to, determine, how, accurate, the, iqcode, is, for, diagnosing, or, predicting, dementia, the, alzheimer, s, disease, caregiver, questionnaire, is, another, tool, it, is, about, 90, accurate, for, alzheimer, s, when, by, a, caregiver, the, general, practitioner, assessment, of, cognition, combines, both, a, patient, assessment, and, an, informant, interview, it, was, specifically, designed, for, use, in, the, primary, care, setting, clinical, neuropsychologists, provide, diagnostic, consultation, following, administration, of, a, full, battery, of, cognitive, testing, often, lasting, several, hours, to, determine, functional, patterns, of, decline, associated, with, varying, types, of, dementia, tests, of, memory, executive, function, processing, speed, attention, and, language, skills, are, relevant, as, well, as, tests, of, emotional, and, psychological, adjustment, these, tests, assist, with, ruling, out, other, etiologies, and, determining, relative, cognitive, decline, over, time, or, from, estimates, of, prior, cognitive, abilities, routine, blood, tests, are, usually, performed, to, rule, out, treatable, causes, these, include, tests, for, vitamin, b, 12, folic, acid, thyroid, stimulating, hormone, tsh, c, reactive, protein, full, blood, count, electrolytes, calcium, renal, function, and, liver, enzymes, abnormalities, may, suggest, vitamin, deficiency, infection, or, other, problems, that, commonly, cause, confusion, or, disorientation, in, the, elderly, a, ct, scan, or, mri, scan, is, commonly, performed, to, possibly, find, either, normal, pressure, hydrocephalus, a, potentially, reversible, cause, of, dementia, or, connected, tumor, the, scans, can, also, yield, information, relevant, to, other, types, of, dementia, such, as, infarction, stroke, that, would, point, at, a, vascular, type, of, dementia, these, tests, do, not, pick, up, diffuse, metabolic, changes, associated, with, dementia, in, a, person, who, shows, no, gross, neurological, problems, such, as, paralysis, or, weakness, on, a, neurological, exam, the, functional, neuroimaging, modalities, of, spect, and, pet, are, more, useful, in, assessing, long, standing, cognitive, dysfunction, since, they, have, shown, similar, ability, to, diagnose, dementia, as, a, clinical, exam, and, cognitive, testing, the, ability, of, spect, to, differentiate, vascular, dementia, from, alzheimer, s, disease, appears, superior, to, differentiation, by, clinical, exam, the, value, of, pib, pet, imaging, using, pittsburgh, compound, b, pib, as, a, radiotracer, has, been, established, in, predictive, diagnosis, particularly, alzheimer, s, disease, risk, factors, for, dementia, include, high, blood, pressure, hearing, loss, smoking, obesity, depression, inactivity, diabetes, lower, levels, of, education, and, low, social, contact, over, indulgence, in, alcohol, lack, of, sleep, anemia, traumatic, brain, injury, and, air, pollution, can, also, increase, the, chance, of, developing, dementia, many, of, these, risk, factors, including, the, lower, level, of, education, smoking, physical, inactivity, and, diabetes, are, modifiable, several, of, the, group, are, known, as, vascular, risk, factors, that, may, be, possible, to, be, reduced, or, eliminated, managing, these, risk, factors, can, reduce, the, risk, of, dementia, in, individuals, in, their, late, midlife, or, older, age, a, reduction, in, a, number, of, these, risk, factors, can, give, a, positive, outcome, the, decreased, risk, achieved, by, adopting, a, healthy, lifestyle, is, seen, even, in, those, with, a, high, genetic, risk, in, addition, to, the, above, risk, factors, other, psychological, features, including, certain, personality, traits, high, neuroticism, and, low, conscientiousness, low, purpose, in, life, and, high, loneliness, are, risk, factors, for, alzheimer, s, disease, and, related, dementias, for, example, based, on, the, english, longitudinal, study, of, ageing, elsa, research, found, that, loneliness, in, older, people, can, increase, the, risk, of, dementia, by, one, third, not, having, a, partner, being, single, divorced, or, widowed, can, double, the, risk, of, dementia, however, having, two, or, three, closer, relationships, might, reduce, the, risk, by, three, fifths, the, two, most, modifiable, risk, factors, for, dementia, are, physical, inactivity, and, lack, of, cognitive, stimulation, physical, activity, in, particular, aerobic, exercise, is, associated, with, a, reduction, in, age, related, brain, tissue, loss, and, neurotoxic, factors, thereby, preserving, brain, volume, and, neuronal, integrity, cognitive, activity, strengthens, neural, plasticity, and, together, they, help, to, support, cognitive, reserve, the, neglect, of, these, risk, factors, diminishes, this, reserve, sensory, impairments, of, vision, and, hearing, are, modifiable, risk, factors, for, dementia, these, impairments, may, precede, the, cognitive, symptoms, of, alzheimer, s, disease, for, example, by, many, years, hearing, loss, may, lead, to, social, isolation, which, negatively, affects, cognition, social, isolation, is, also, identified, as, a, modifiable, risk, factor, age, related, hearing, loss, in, midlife, is, linked, to, cognitive, impairment, in, late, life, and, is, seen, as, a, risk, factor, for, the, development, of, alzheimer, s, disease, and, dementia, such, hearing, loss, may, be, caused, by, a, central, auditory, processing, disorder, that, makes, the, understanding, of, speech, against, background, noise, difficult, age, related, hearing, loss, is, characterised, by, slowed, central, processing, of, auditory, information, worldwide, mid, life, hearing, loss, may, account, for, around, 9, of, dementia, cases, frailty, may, increase, the, risk, of, cognitive, decline, and, dementia, and, the, inverse, also, holds, of, cognitive, impairment, increasing, the, risk, of, frailty, prevention, of, frailty, may, help, to, prevent, cognitive, decline, there, are, no, medications, that, can, prevent, cognitive, decline, and, dementia, however, blood, pressure, lowering, medications, might, decrease, the, risk, of, dementia, or, cognitive, problems, by, around, 0, 5, economic, disadvantage, has, been, shown, to, have, a, strong, link, to, higher, dementia, prevalence, which, cannot, yet, be, fully, explained, by, other, risk, factors, limited, evidence, links, poor, oral, health, to, cognitive, decline, however, failure, to, perform, tooth, brushing, and, gingival, inflammation, can, be, used, as, dementia, risk, predictors, the, link, between, alzheimer, s, and, gum, disease, is, oral, bacteria, in, the, oral, cavity, bacterial, species, include, p, gingivalis, f, nucleatum, p, intermedia, and, t, forsythia, six, oral, treponema, spirochetes, have, been, examined, in, the, brains, of, alzheimer, s, patients, spirochetes, are, neurotropic, in, nature, meaning, they, act, to, destroy, nerve, tissue, and, create, inflammation, inflammatory, pathogens, are, an, indicator, of, alzheimer, s, disease, and, bacteria, related, to, gum, disease, have, been, found, in, the, brains, of, patients, with, alzheimer, s, disease, the, bacteria, invade, nerve, tissue, in, the, brain, increasing, the, permeability, of, the, blood, brain, barrier, and, promoting, the, onset, of, alzheimer, s, individuals, with, a, plethora, of, tooth, plaque, risk, cognitive, decline, poor, oral, hygiene, can, have, an, adverse, effect, on, speech, and, nutrition, causing, general, and, cognitive, health, decline, herpes, simplex, virus, hsv, has, been, found, in, more, than, 70, of, those, aged, over, 50, hsv, persists, in, the, peripheral, nervous, system, and, can, be, triggered, by, stress, illness, or, fatigue, high, proportions, of, viral, associated, proteins, in, amyloid, plaques, or, neurofibrillary, tangles, nfts, confirm, the, involvement, of, hsv, 1, in, alzheimer, s, disease, pathology, nfts, are, known, as, the, primary, marker, of, alzheimer, s, disease, hsv, 1, produces, the, main, components, of, nfts, diet, is, seen, to, be, a, modifiable, risk, factor, for, the, development, of, dementia, thiamine, deficiency, is, identified, to, increase, the, risk, of, alzheimer, s, disease, in, adults, the, role, of, thiamine, in, brain, physiology, is, unique, and, essential, for, the, normal, cognitive, function, of, older, people, many, dietary, choices, of, the, elderly, population, including, the, higher, intake, of, gluten, free, products, compromise, the, intake, of, thiamine, as, these, products, are, not, fortified, with, thiamine, the, mediterranean, and, dash, diets, are, both, associated, with, less, cognitive, decline, a, different, approach, has, been, to, incorporate, elements, of, both, of, these, diets, into, one, known, as, the, mind, diet, these, diets, are, generally, low, in, saturated, fats, while, providing, a, good, source, of, carbohydrates, mainly, those, that, help, stabilize, blood, sugar, and, insulin, levels, raised, blood, sugar, levels, over, a, long, time, can, damage, nerves, and, cause, memory, problems, if, they, are, not, managed, nutritional, factors, associated, with, the, proposed, diets, for, reducing, dementia, risk, include, unsaturated, fatty, acids, vitamin, e, vitamin, c, flavonoids, vitamin, b, and, vitamin, d, a, study, conducted, at, the, university, of, exeter, in, the, united, kingdom, seems, to, have, confirmed, these, findings, with, fruits, vegetables, whole, grains, and, healthy, fats, creating, an, optimum, diet, that, can, help, reduce, the, risk, of, dementia, by, roughly, 25, the, mind, diet, may, be, more, protective, but, further, studies, are, needed, the, mediterranean, diet, seems, to, be, more, protective, against, alzheimer, s, than, dash, but, there, are, no, consistent, findings, against, dementia, in, general, the, role, of, olive, oil, needs, further, study, as, it, may, be, one, of, the, most, important, components, in, reducing, the, risk, of, cognitive, decline, and, dementia, in, those, with, celiac, disease, or, non, celiac, gluten, sensitivity, a, strict, gluten, free, diet, may, relieve, the, symptoms, given, a, mild, cognitive, impairment, once, dementia, is, advanced, no, evidence, suggests, that, a, gluten, free, diet, is, useful, omega, 3, fatty, acid, supplements, do, not, appear, to, benefit, or, harm, people, with, mild, to, moderate, symptoms, however, there, is, good, evidence, that, omega, 3, incorporation, into, the, diet, is, of, benefit, in, treating, depression, a, common, symptom, and, potentially, modifiable, risk, factor, for, dementia, there, are, limited, options, for, treating, dementia, with, most, approaches, focused, on, managing, or, reducing, individual, symptoms, there, are, no, treatment, options, available, to, delay, the, onset, of, dementia, acetylcholinesterase, inhibitors, are, often, used, early, in, the, disorder, course, however, benefit, is, generally, small, more, than, half, of, people, with, dementia, may, experience, psychological, or, behavioral, symptoms, including, agitation, sleep, problems, aggression, and, or, psychosis, treatment, for, these, symptoms, is, aimed, at, reducing, the, person, s, distress, and, keeping, the, person, safe, treatments, other, than, medication, appear, to, be, better, for, agitation, and, aggression, cognitive, and, behavioral, interventions, may, be, appropriate, some, evidence, suggests, that, education, and, support, for, the, person, with, dementia, as, well, as, caregivers, and, family, members, improves, outcomes, palliative, care, interventions, may, lead, to, improvements, in, comfort, in, dying, but, the, evidence, is, low, exercise, programs, are, beneficial, with, respect, to, activities, of, daily, living, and, potentially, improve, dementia, the, effect, of, therapies, can, be, evaluated, for, example, by, assessing, agitation, using, the, cohen, mansfield, agitation, inventory, cmai, by, assessing, mood, and, engagement, with, the, menorah, park, engagement, scale, mpes, and, the, observed, emotion, rating, scale, oers, or, by, assessing, indicators, for, depression, using, the, cornell, scale, for, depression, in, dementia, csdd, or, a, simplified, version, thereof, often, overlooked, in, treating, and, managing, dementia, is, the, role, of, the, caregiver, and, what, is, known, about, how, they, can, support, multiple, interventions, findings, from, a, 2021, systematic, review, of, the, literature, found, caregivers, of, people, with, dementia, in, nursing, homes, do, not, have, sufficient, tools, or, clinical, guidance, for, behavioral, and, psychological, symptoms, of, dementia, bpsd, along, with, medication, use, simple, measures, like, talking, to, people, about, their, interests, can, improve, the, quality, of, life, for, care, home, residents, living, with, dementia, a, programme, showed, that, such, simple, measures, reduced, residents, agitation, and, depression, they, also, needed, fewer, gp, visits, and, hospital, admissions, which, also, meant, that, the, programme, was, cost, saving, psychological, therapies, for, dementia, include, some, limited, evidence, for, reminiscence, therapy, namely, some, positive, effects, in, the, areas, of, quality, of, life, cognition, communication, and, mood, the, first, three, particularly, in, care, home, settings, some, benefit, for, cognitive, reframing, for, caretakers, unclear, evidence, for, validation, therapy, and, tentative, evidence, for, mental, exercises, such, as, cognitive, stimulation, programs, for, people, with, mild, to, moderate, dementia, offering, personally, tailored, activities, may, help, reduce, challenging, behavior, and, may, improve, quality, of, life, it, is, not, clear, if, personally, tailored, activities, have, an, impact, on, affect, or, improve, for, the, quality, of, life, for, the, caregiver, adult, daycare, centers, as, well, as, special, care, units, in, nursing, homes, often, provide, specialized, care, for, dementia, patients, daycare, centers, offer, supervision, recreation, meals, and, limited, health, care, to, participants, as, well, as, providing, respite, for, caregivers, in, addition, home, care, can, provide, one, to, one, support, and, care, in, the, home, allowing, for, more, individualized, attention, that, is, needed, as, the, disorder, progresses, psychiatric, nurses, can, make, a, distinctive, contribution, to, people, s, mental, health, since, dementia, impairs, normal, communication, due, to, changes, in, receptive, and, expressive, language, as, well, as, the, ability, to, plan, and, problem, solve, agitated, behavior, is, often, a, form, of, communication, for, the, person, with, dementia, actively, searching, for, a, potential, cause, such, as, pain, physical, illness, or, overstimulation, can, be, helpful, in, reducing, agitation, additionally, using, an, abc, analysis, of, behavior, can, be, a, useful, tool, for, understanding, behavior, in, people, with, dementia, it, involves, looking, at, the, antecedents, a, behavior, b, and, consequences, c, associated, with, an, event, to, help, define, the, problem, and, prevent, further, incidents, that, may, arise, if, the, person, s, needs, are, misunderstood, the, strongest, evidence, for, non, pharmacological, therapies, for, the, management, of, changed, behaviors, in, dementia, is, for, using, such, approaches, low, quality, evidence, suggests, that, regular, at, least, five, sessions, of, music, therapy, may, help, institutionalized, residents, it, may, reduce, depressive, symptoms, and, improve, overall, behaviors, it, may, also, supply, a, beneficial, effect, on, emotional, well, being, and, quality, of, life, as, well, as, reduce, anxiety, in, 2003, the, alzheimer, s, society, established, singing, for, the, brain, sftb, a, project, based, on, pilot, studies, which, suggested, that, the, activity, encouraged, participation, and, facilitated, the, learning, of, new, songs, the, sessions, combine, aspects, of, reminiscence, therapy, and, music, musical, and, interpersonal, connectedness, can, underscore, the, value, of, the, person, and, improve, quality, of, life, some, london, hospitals, found, that, using, color, designs, pictures, and, lights, helped, people, with, dementia, adjust, to, being, at, the, hospital, these, adjustments, to, the, layout, of, the, dementia, wings, at, these, hospitals, helped, patients, by, preventing, confusion, life, story, work, as, part, of, reminiscence, therapy, and, video, biographies, have, been, found, to, address, the, needs, of, clients, and, their, caregivers, in, various, ways, offering, the, client, the, opportunity, to, leave, a, legacy, and, enhance, their, personhood, and, also, benefitting, youth, who, participate, in, such, work, such, interventions, can, be, more, beneficial, when, undertaken, at, a, relatively, early, stage, of, dementia, they, may, also, be, problematic, in, those, who, have, difficulties, in, processing, past, experiences, animal, assisted, therapy, has, been, found, to, be, helpful, drawbacks, may, be, that, pets, are, not, always, welcomed, in, a, communal, space, in, the, care, setting, an, animal, may, pose, a, risk, to, residents, or, may, be, perceived, to, be, dangerous, certain, animals, may, also, be, regarded, as, unclean, or, dangerous, by, some, cultural, groups, occupational, therapy, also, addresses, psychological, and, psychosocial, needs, of, patients, with, dementia, through, improving, daily, occupational, performance, and, caregivers, competence, when, compensatory, intervention, strategies, are, added, to, their, daily, routine, the, level, of, performance, is, enhanced, and, reduces, the, burden, commonly, placed, on, their, caregivers, occupational, therapists, can, also, work, with, other, disciplines, to, create, a, client, centered, intervention, to, manage, cognitive, disability, and, coping, with, behavioral, and, psychological, symptoms, of, dementia, combined, occupational, and, behavioral, therapies, can, support, patients, with, dementia, even, further, there, is, no, strong, evidence, to, suggest, that, cognitive, training, is, beneficial, for, people, with, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, or, mild, cognitive, impairment, however, a, 2023, review, found, that, cognitive, rehabilitation, may, be, effective, in, helping, individuals, with, mild, to, moderate, dementia, to, manage, their, daily, activities, offering, personally, tailored, activity, sessions, to, people, with, dementia, in, long, term, care, homes, may, slightly, reduce, challenging, behavior, no, medications, have, been, shown, to, prevent, or, cure, dementia, medications, may, be, used, to, treat, the, behavioral, and, cognitive, symptoms, but, have, no, effect, on, the, underlying, disease, process, acetylcholinesterase, inhibitors, such, as, donepezil, may, be, useful, for, alzheimer, s, disease, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, dlb, or, vascular, dementia, the, quality, of, the, evidence, is, poor, and, the, benefit, is, small, no, difference, has, been, shown, between, the, agents, in, this, family, in, a, minority, of, people, side, effects, include, a, slow, heart, rate, and, fainting, rivastigmine, is, recommended, for, treating, symptoms, in, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, medications, that, have, anticholinergic, effects, increase, all, cause, mortality, in, people, with, dementia, although, the, effect, of, these, medications, on, cognitive, function, remains, uncertain, according, to, a, systematic, review, published, in, 2021, before, prescribing, antipsychotic, medication, in, the, elderly, an, assessment, for, an, underlying, cause, of, the, behavior, is, needed, severe, and, life, threatening, reactions, occur, in, almost, half, of, people, with, dlb, and, can, be, fatal, after, a, single, dose, people, with, lewy, body, dementias, who, take, neuroleptics, are, at, risk, for, neuroleptic, malignant, syndrome, a, life, threatening, illness, extreme, caution, is, required, in, the, use, of, antipsychotic, medication, in, people, with, dlb, because, of, their, sensitivity, to, these, agents, antipsychotic, drugs, are, used, to, treat, dementia, only, if, non, drug, therapies, have, not, worked, and, the, person, s, actions, threaten, themselves, or, others, aggressive, behavior, changes, are, sometimes, the, result, of, other, solvable, problems, that, could, make, treatment, with, antipsychotics, unnecessary, because, people, with, dementia, can, be, aggressive, resistant, to, their, treatment, and, otherwise, disruptive, sometimes, antipsychotic, drugs, are, considered, as, a, therapy, in, response, these, drugs, have, risky, adverse, effects, including, increasing, the, person, s, chance, of, stroke, and, death, given, these, adverse, events, and, small, benefit, antipsychotics, are, avoided, whenever, possible, generally, stopping, antipsychotics, for, people, with, dementia, does, not, cause, problems, even, in, those, who, have, been, on, them, a, long, time, n, methyl, d, aspartate, nmda, receptor, blockers, such, as, memantine, may, be, of, benefit, but, the, evidence, is, less, conclusive, than, for, acheis, due, to, their, differing, mechanisms, of, action, memantine, and, acetylcholinesterase, inhibitors, can, be, used, in, combination, however, the, benefit, is, slight, an, extract, of, ginkgo, biloba, known, as, egb, 761, has, been, widely, used, for, treating, mild, to, moderate, dementia, and, other, neuropsychiatric, disorders, its, use, is, approved, throughout, europe, the, world, federation, of, biological, psychiatry, guidelines, lists, egb, 761, with, the, same, weight, of, evidence, level, b, given, to, acetylcholinesterase, inhibitors, and, memantine, egb, 761, is, the, only, one, that, showed, improvement, of, symptoms, in, both, ad, and, vascular, dementia, egb, 761, is, seen, as, being, able, to, play, an, important, role, either, on, its, own, or, as, an, add, on, particularly, when, other, therapies, prove, ineffective, egb, 761, is, seen, to, be, neuroprotective, it, is, a, free, radical, scavenger, improves, mitochondrial, function, and, modulates, serotonin, and, dopamine, levels, many, studies, of, its, use, in, mild, to, moderate, dementia, have, shown, it, to, significantly, improve, cognitive, function, activities, of, daily, living, neuropsychiatric, symptoms, and, quality, of, life, however, its, use, has, not, been, shown, to, prevent, the, progression, of, dementia, while, depression, is, frequently, associated, with, dementia, the, use, of, antidepressants, such, as, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitors, ssris, do, not, appear, to, affect, outcomes, however, the, ssris, sertraline, and, citalopram, have, been, demonstrated, to, reduce, symptoms, of, agitation, compared, to, placebo, no, solid, evidence, indicates, that, folate, or, vitamin, b, 12, improves, outcomes, in, those, with, cognitive, problems, statins, have, no, benefit, in, dementia, medications, for, other, health, conditions, may, need, to, be, managed, differently, for, a, person, who, has, a, dementia, diagnosis, it, is, unclear, whether, blood, pressure, medication, and, dementia, are, linked, people, may, experience, an, increase, in, cardiovascular, related, events, if, these, medications, are, withdrawn, the, medication, appropriateness, tool, for, comorbid, health, conditions, in, dementia, match, d, criteria, can, help, identify, ways, that, a, diagnosis, of, dementia, changes, medication, management, for, other, health, conditions, these, criteria, were, developed, because, people, with, dementia, live, with, an, average, of, five, other, chronic, diseases, which, are, often, managed, with, medications, the, systematic, review, that, informed, the, criteria, were, published, subsequently, in, 2018, and, updated, in, 2022, over, 40, of, people, with, dementia, report, sleep, problems, approaches, to, treating, these, sleep, problems, include, medications, and, non, pharmacological, approaches, the, use, of, medications, to, alleviate, sleep, disturbances, that, people, with, dementia, often, experience, has, not, been, well, researched, even, for, medications, that, are, commonly, prescribed, in, 2012, the, american, geriatrics, society, recommended, that, benzodiazepines, such, as, diazepam, and, non, benzodiazepine, hypnotics, be, avoided, for, people, with, dementia, due, to, the, risks, of, increased, cognitive, impairment, and, falls, benzodiazepines, are, also, known, to, promote, delirium, additionally, little, evidence, supports, the, effectiveness, of, benzodiazepines, in, this, population, no, clear, evidence, shows, that, melatonin, or, ramelteon, improves, sleep, for, people, with, dementia, due, to, alzheimer, s, but, it, is, used, to, treat, rem, sleep, behavior, disorder, in, dementia, with, lewy, bodies, limited, evidence, suggests, that, a, low, dose, of, trazodone, may, improve, sleep, however, more, research, is, needed, non, pharmacological, approaches, have, been, suggested, for, treating, sleep, problems, for, those, with, dementia, however, there, is, no, strong, evidence, or, firm, conclusions, on, the, effectiveness, of, different, types, of, interventions, especially, for, those, who, are, living, in, an, institutionalized, setting, such, as, a, nursing, home, or, long, term, care, home, as, people, age, they, experience, more, health, problems, and, most, health, problems, associated, with, aging, carry, a, substantial, burden, of, pain, therefore, between, 25, and, 50, of, older, adults, experience, persistent, pain, seniors, with, dementia, experience, the, same, prevalence, of, conditions, likely, to, cause, pain, as, seniors, without, dementia, pain, is, often, overlooked, in, older, adults, and, when, screened, for, is, often, poorly, assessed, especially, among, those, with, dementia, since, they, become, incapable, of, informing, others, of, their, pain, beyond, the, issue, of, humane, care, unrelieved, pain, has, functional, implications, persistent, pain, can, lead, to, decreased, ambulation, depressed, mood, sleep, disturbances, impaired, appetite, and, exacerbation, of, cognitive, impairment, and, pain, related, interference, with, activity, is, a, factor, contributing, to, falls, in, the, elderly, although, persistent, pain, in, people, with, dementia, is, difficult, to, communicate, diagnose, and, treat, failure, to, address, persistent, pain, has, profound, functional, psychosocial, and, quality, of, life, implications, for, this, vulnerable, population, health, professionals, often, lack, the, skills, and, usually, lack, the, time, needed, to, recognize, accurately, assess, and, adequately, monitor, pain, in, people, with, dementia, family, members, and, friends, can, make, a, valuable, contribution, to, the, care,

physically, or, chemically, restrained, to, a, greater, degree, than, necessary, raising, issues, of, human, rights, social, stigma, is, commonly, perceived, by, those, with, the, condition, and, also, by, their, caregivers, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, dementia, was, a, much, broader, clinical, concept, it, included, mental, illness, and, any, type, of, psychosocial, incapacity, including, reversible, conditions, dementia, at, this, time, simply, referred, to, anyone, who, had, lost, the, ability, to, reason, and, was, applied, equally, to, psychosis, organic, diseases, like, syphilis, that, destroy, the, brain, and, to, the, dementia, associated, with, old, age, which, was, attributed, to, hardening, of, the, arteries, dementia, has, been, referred, to, in, medical, texts, since, antiquity, one, of, the, earliest, known, allusions, to, dementia, is, attributed, to, the, 7th, century, bc, greek, philosopher, pythagoras, who, divided, the, human, lifespan, into, six, distinct, phases, 0, 6, infancy, 7, 21, adolescence, 22, 49, young, adulthood, 50, 62, middle, age, 63, 79, old, age, and, 80, death, advanced, age, the, last, two, he, described, as, the, senium, a, period, of, mental, and, physical, decay, and, that, the, final, phase, was, when, the, scene, of, mortal, existence, closes, after, a, great, length, of, time, that, very, fortunately, few, of, the, human, species, arrive, at, where, the, mind, is, reduced, to, the, imbecility, of, the, first, epoch, of, infancy, in, 550, bc, the, athenian, statesman, and, poet, solon, argued, that, the, terms, of, a, man, s, will, might, be, invalidated, if, he, exhibited, loss, of, judgement, due, to, advanced, age, chinese, medical, texts, made, allusions, to, the, condition, as, well, and, the, characters, for, dementia, translate, literally, to, foolish, old, person, athenian, philosophers, aristotle, and, plato, discussed, the, mental, decline, that, can, come, with, old, age, and, predicted, that, this, affects, everyone, who, becomes, old, and, nothing, can, be, done, to, stop, this, decline, from, taking, place, plato, specifically, talked, about, how, the, elderly, should, not, be, in, positions, that, require, responsibility, because, there, is, not, much, acumen, of, the, mind, that, once, carried, them, in, their, youth, those, characteristics, one, would, call, judgement, imagination, power, of, reasoning, and, memory, they, see, them, gradually, blunted, by, deterioration, and, can, hardly, fulfill, their, function, for, comparison, the, roman, statesman, cicero, held, a, view, much, more, in, line, with, modern, day, medical, wisdom, that, loss, of, mental, function, was, not, inevitable, in, the, elderly, and, affected, only, those, old, men, who, were, weak, willed, he, spoke, of, how, those, who, remained, mentally, active, and, eager, to, learn, new, things, could, stave, off, dementia, however, cicero, s, views, on, aging, although, progressive, were, largely, ignored, in, a, world, that, would, be, dominated, for, centuries, by, aristotle, s, medical, writings, physicians, during, the, roman, empire, such, as, galen, and, celsus, simply, repeated, the, beliefs, of, aristotle, while, adding, few, new, contributions, to, medical, knowledge, byzantine, physicians, sometimes, wrote, of, dementia, it, is, recorded, that, at, least, seven, emperors, whose, lifespans, exceeded, 70, years, displayed, signs, of, cognitive, decline, in, constantinople, special, hospitals, housed, those, diagnosed, with, dementia, or, insanity, but, these, did, not, apply, to, the, emperors, who, were, above, the, law, and, whose, health, conditions, could, not, be, publicly, acknowledged, otherwise, little, is, recorded, about, dementia, in, western, medical, texts, for, nearly, 1700, years, one, of, the, few, references, was, the, 13th, century, friar, roger, bacon, who, viewed, old, age, as, divine, punishment, for, original, sin, although, he, repeated, existing, aristotelian, beliefs, that, dementia, was, inevitable, he, did, make, the, progressive, assertion, that, the, brain, was, the, center, of, memory, and, thought, rather, than, the, heart, poets, playwrights, and, other, writers, made, frequent, allusions, to, the, loss, of, mental, function, in, old, age, william, shakespeare, notably, mentions, it, in, plays, such, as, hamlet, and, king, lear, during, the, 19th, century, doctors, generally, came, to, believe, that, elderly, dementia, was, the, result, of, cerebral, atherosclerosis, although, opinions, fluctuated, between, the, idea, that, it, was, due, to, blockage, of, the, major, arteries, supplying, the, brain, or, small, strokes, within, the, vessels, of, the, cerebral, cortex, in, 1907, bavarian, psychiatrist, alois, alzheimer, was, the, first, to, identify, and, describe, the, characteristics, of, progressive, dementia, in, the, brain, of, 51, year, old, auguste, deter, deter, had, begun, to, behave, uncharacteristically, including, accusing, her, husband, of, adultery, neglecting, household, chores, exhibiting, difficulties, writing, and, engaging, in, conversations, heightened, insomnia, and, loss, of, directional, sense, at, one, point, deter, was, reported, to, have, dragged, a, bed, sheet, outside, wandered, around, wildly, and, cried, for, hours, at, midnight, alzheimer, began, treating, deter, when, she, entered, a, frankfurt, mental, hospital, on, november, 25, 1901, during, her, ongoing, treatment, deter, and, her, husband, struggled, to, afford, the, cost, of, the, medical, care, and, alzheimer, agreed, to, continue, her, treatment, in, exchange, for, deter, s, medical, records, and, donation, of, her, brain, upon, death, deter, died, on, april, 8, 1906, after, succumbing, to, sepsis, and, pneumonia, alzheimer, conducted, the, brain, biopsy, using, the, bielschowsky, stain, method, which, was, a, new, development, at, the, time, and, he, observed, senile, plaques, neurofibrillary, tangles, and, atherosclerotic, alteration, at, the, time, the, consensus, among, medical, doctors, had, been, that, senile, plaques, were, generally, found, in, older, patients, and, the, occurrence, of, neurofibrillary, tangles, was, an, entirely, new, observation, at, the, time, alzheimer, presented, his, findings, at, the, 37th, psychiatry, conference, of, southwestern, germany, in, t, bingen, on, april, 11, 1906, however, the, information, was, poorly, received, by, his, peers, by, 1910, alois, alzheimer, s, teacher, emil, kraepelin, published, a, book, in, which, he, coined, the, term, alzheimer, s, disease, in, an, attempt, to, acknowledge, the, importance, of, alzheimer, s, discovery, by, the, 1960s, the, link, between, neurodegenerative, diseases, and, age, related, cognitive, decline, had, become, more, established, by, the, 1970s, the, medical, community, maintained, that, vascular, dementia, was, rarer, than, previously, thought, and, alzheimer, s, disease, caused, the, vast, majority, of, old, age, mental, impairments, more, recently, however, it, is, believed, that, dementia, is, often, a, mixture, of, conditions, in, 1976, neurologist, robert, katzmann, suggested, a, link, between, senile, dementia, and, alzheimer, s, disease, katzmann, suggested, that, much, of, the, senile, dementia, occurring, by, definition, after, the, age, of, 65, was, pathologically, identical, with, alzheimer, s, disease, occurring, in, people, under, age, 65, and, therefore, should, not, be, treated, differently, katzmann, thus, suggested, that, alzheimer, s, disease, if, taken, to, occur, over, age, 65, is, actually, common, not, rare, and, was, the, fourth, or, 5th, leading, cause, of, death, even, though, rarely, reported, on, death, certificates, in, 1976, a, helpful, finding, was, that, although, the, incidence, of, alzheimer, s, disease, increased, with, age, from, 5, 10, of, 75, year, olds, to, as, many, as, 40, 50, of, 90, year, olds, no, threshold, was, found, by, which, age, all, persons, developed, it, this, is, shown, by, documented, supercentenarians, people, living, to, 110, or, more, who, experienced, no, substantial, cognitive, impairment, some, evidence, suggests, that, dementia, is, most, likely, to, develop, between, ages, 80, and, 84, and, individuals, who, pass, that, point, without, being, affected, have, a, lower, chance, of, developing, it, women, account, for, a, larger, percentage, of, dementia, cases, than, men, although, this, can, be, attributed, to, their, longer, overall, lifespan, and, greater, odds, of, attaining, an, age, where, the, condition, is, likely, to, occur, much, like, other, diseases, associated, with, aging, dementia, was, comparatively, rare, before, the, 20th, century, because, few, people, lived, past, 80, conversely, syphilitic, dementia, was, widespread, in, the, developed, world, until, it, was, largely, eradicated, by, the, use, of, penicillin, after, world, war, ii, with, significant, increases, in, life, expectancy, thereafter, the, number, of, people, over, 65, started, rapidly, climbing, while, elderly, persons, constituted, an, average, of, 3, 5, of, the, population, prior, to, 1945, by, 2010, many, countries, reached, 10, 14, and, in, germany, and, japan, this, figure, exceeded, 20, public, awareness, of, alzheimer, s, disease, greatly, increased, in, 1994, when, former, us, president, ronald, reagan, announced, that, he, had, been, diagnosed, with, the, condition, in, the, 21st, century, other, types, of, dementia, were, differentiated, from, alzheimer, s, disease, and, vascular, dementias, the, most, common, types, this, differentiation, is, on, the, basis, of, pathological, examination, of, brain, tissues, by, symptomatology, and, by, different, patterns, of, brain, metabolic, activity, in, nuclear, medical, imaging, tests, such, as, spect, and, pet, scans, of, the, brain, the, various, forms, have, differing, prognoses, and, differing, epidemiologic, risk, factors, the, main, cause, for, many, diseases, including, alzheimer, s, disease, remains, unclear, dementia, in, the, elderly, was, once, called, senile, dementia, or, senility, and, viewed, as, a, normal, and, somewhat, inevitable, aspect, of, aging, by, 1913, 20, the, term, dementia, praecox, was, introduced, to, suggest, the, development, of, senile, type, dementia, at, a, younger, age, eventually, the, two, terms, fused, so, that, until, 1952, physicians, used, the, terms, dementia, praecox, precocious, dementia, and, schizophrenia, interchangeably, since, then, science, has, determined, that, dementia, and, schizophrenia, are, two, different, disorders, though, they, share, some, similarities, the, term, precocious, dementia, for, a, mental, illness, suggested, that, a, type, of, mental, illness, like, schizophrenia, including, paranoia, and, decreased, cognitive, capacity, could, be, expected, to, arrive, normally, in, all, persons, with, greater, age, see, paraphrenia, after, about, 1920, the, beginning, use, of, dementia, for, what, is, now, understood, as, schizophrenia, and, senile, dementia, helped, limit, the, word, s, meaning, to, permanent, irreversible, mental, deterioration, this, began, the, change, to, the, later, use, of, the, term, in, recent, studies, researchers, have, seen, a, connection, between, those, diagnosed, with, schizophrenia, and, patients, who, are, diagnosed, with, dementia, finding, a, positive, correlation, between, the, two, diseases, the, view, that, dementia, must, always, be, the, result, of, a, particular, disease, process, led, for, a, time, to, the, proposed, diagnosis, of, senile, dementia, of, the, alzheimer, s, type, sdat, in, persons, over, the, age, of, 65, with, alzheimer, s, disease, diagnosed, in, persons, younger, than, 65, who, had, the, same, pathology, eventually, however, it, was, agreed, that, the, age, limit, was, artificial, and, that, alzheimer, s, disease, was, the, appropriate, term, for, persons, with, that, particular, brain, pathology, regardless, of, age, after, 1952, mental, illnesses, including, schizophrenia, were, removed, from, the, category, of, organic, brain, syndromes, and, thus, by, definition, removed, from, possible, causes, of, dementing, illnesses, dementias, at, the, same, however, the, traditional, cause, of, senile, dementia, hardening, of, the, arteries, now, returned, as, a, set, of, dementias, of, vascular, cause, small, strokes, these, were, now, termed, multi, infarct, dementias, or, vascular, dementias, the, societal, cost, of, dementia, is, high, especially, for, caregivers, according, to, a, uk, based, study, almost, two, out, of, three, carers, of, people, with, dementia, feel, lonely, most, of, the, carers, in, the, study, were, family, members, or, friends, as, of, 2015, the, annual, cost, per, alzheimer, s, patient, in, the, united, states, was, around, 19, 144, 36, the, total, costs, for, the, nation, is, estimated, to, be, about, 167, 74, billion, by, 2030, it, is, predicted, the, annual, socioeconomic, cost, will, total, to, about, 507, billion, and, by, 2050, that, number, is, expected, to, reach, 1, 89, trillion, this, steady, increase, will, be, seen, not, just, within, the, united, states, but, globally, global, estimates, for, the, costs, of, dementia, were, 957, 56, billion, in, 2015, but, by, 2050, the, estimated, global, cost, is, 9, 12, trillion, many, countries, consider, the, care, of, people, living, with, dementia, a, national, priority, and, invest, in, resources, and, education, to, better, inform, health, and, social, service, workers, unpaid, caregivers, relatives, and, members, of,
