see, classification, brown, algae, sg, alga, are, a, large, group, of, multicellular, algae, comprising, the, class, phaeophyceae, they, include, many, seaweeds, located, in, colder, waters, of, the, northern, hemisphere, brown, algae, are, the, major, seaweeds, of, the, temperate, and, polar, regions, many, brown, algae, such, as, members, of, the, order, fucales, commonly, grow, along, rocky, seashores, most, brown, algae, live, in, marine, environments, where, they, play, an, important, role, both, as, food, and, as, a, potential, habitat, for, instance, macrocystis, a, kelp, of, the, order, laminariales, may, reach, 60, m, 200, ft, in, length, and, forms, prominent, underwater, kelp, forests, that, contain, a, high, level, of, biodiversity, another, example, is, sargassum, which, creates, unique, floating, mats, of, seaweed, in, the, tropical, waters, of, the, sargasso, sea, that, serve, as, the, habitats, for, many, species, some, members, of, the, class, such, as, kelps, are, used, by, humans, as, food, between, 1, 500, and, 2, 000, species, of, brown, algae, are, known, worldwide, some, species, such, as, ascophyllum, nodosum, have, become, subjects, of, extensive, research, in, their, own, right, due, to, their, commercial, importance, they, also, have, environmental, significance, through, carbon, fixation, brown, algae, belong, to, the, stramenopiles, a, clade, of, eukaryotic, organisms, that, are, distinguished, from, green, plants, by, having, chloroplasts, surrounded, by, four, membranes, suggesting, that, they, were, acquired, secondarily, from, a, symbiotic, relationship, between, a, basal, eukaryote, and, a, red, or, green, alga, most, brown, algae, contain, the, pigment, fucoxanthin, which, is, responsible, for, the, distinctive, greenish, brown, color, that, gives, them, their, name, brown, algae, are, unique, among, stramenopiles, in, developing, into, multicellular, forms, with, differentiated, tissues, but, they, reproduce, by, means, of, flagellated, spores, and, gametes, that, closely, resemble, cells, of, single, celled, stramenopiles, genetic, studies, show, their, closest, relatives, to, be, the, yellow, green, algae, brown, algae, exist, in, a, wide, range, of, sizes, and, forms, the, smallest, members, of, the, group, grow, as, tiny, feathery, tufts, of, threadlike, cells, no, more, than, a, few, centimeters, a, few, inches, long, some, species, have, a, stage, in, their, life, cycle, that, consists, of, only, a, few, cells, making, the, entire, alga, microscopic, other, groups, of, brown, algae, grow, to, much, larger, sizes, the, rockweeds, and, leathery, kelps, are, often, the, most, conspicuous, algae, in, their, habitats, kelps, can, range, in, size, from, the, 60, centimeter, tall, 2, ft, sea, palm, postelsia, to, the, giant, kelp, macrocystis, pyrifera, which, grows, to, over, 50, m, 150, ft, long, and, is, the, largest, of, all, the, algae, in, form, the, brown, algae, range, from, small, crusts, or, cushions, to, leafy, free, floating, mats, formed, by, species, of, sargassum, they, may, consist, of, delicate, felt, like, strands, of, cells, as, in, ectocarpus, or, of, 30, centimeter, long, 1, ft, flattened, branches, resembling, a, fan, as, in, padina, regardless, of, size, or, form, two, visible, features, set, the, phaeophyceae, apart, from, all, other, algae, first, members, of, the, group, possess, a, characteristic, color, that, ranges, from, an, olive, green, to, various, shades, of, brown, the, particular, shade, depends, upon, the, amount, of, fucoxanthin, present, in, the, alga, second, all, brown, algae, are, multicellular, there, are, no, known, species, that, exist, as, single, cells, or, as, colonies, of, cells, and, the, brown, algae, are, the, only, major, group, of, seaweeds, that, does, not, include, such, forms, however, this, may, be, the, result, of, classification, rather, than, a, consequence, of, evolution, as, all, the, groups, hypothesized, to, be, the, closest, relatives, of, the, browns, include, single, celled, or, colonial, forms, they, can, change, color, depending, on, salinity, ranging, from, reddish, to, brown, whatever, their, form, the, body, of, all, brown, algae, is, termed, a, thallus, indicating, that, it, lacks, the, complex, xylem, and, phloem, of, vascular, plants, this, does, not, mean, that, brown, algae, completely, lack, specialized, structures, but, because, some, botanists, define, true, stems, leaves, and, roots, by, the, presence, of, these, tissues, their, absence, in, the, brown, algae, means, that, the, stem, like, and, leaf, like, structures, found, in, some, groups, of, brown, algae, must, be, described, using, different, terminology, although, not, all, brown, algae, are, structurally, complex, those, that, are, typically, possess, one, or, more, characteristic, parts, a, holdfast, is, a, rootlike, structure, present, at, the, base, of, the, alga, like, a, root, system, in, plants, a, holdfast, serves, to, anchor, the, alga, in, place, on, the, substrate, where, it, grows, and, thus, prevents, the, alga, from, being, carried, away, by, the, current, unlike, a, root, system, the, holdfast, generally, does, not, serve, as, the, primary, organ, for, water, uptake, nor, does, it, take, in, nutrients, from, the, substrate, the, overall, physical, appearance, of, the, holdfast, differs, among, various, brown, algae, and, among, various, substrates, it, may, be, heavily, branched, or, it, may, be, cup, like, in, appearance, a, single, alga, typically, has, just, one, holdfast, although, some, species, have, more, than, one, stipe, growing, from, their, holdfast, a, stipe, is, a, stalk, or, stemlike, structure, present, in, an, alga, it, may, grow, as, a, short, structure, near, the, base, of, the, alga, as, in, laminaria, or, it, may, develop, into, a, large, complex, structure, running, throughout, the, algal, body, as, in, sargassum, or, macrocystis, in, the, most, structurally, differentiated, brown, algae, such, as, fucus, the, tissues, within, the, stipe, are, divided, into, three, distinct, layers, or, regions, these, regions, include, a, central, pith, a, surrounding, cortex, and, an, outer, epidermis, each, of, which, has, an, analog, in, the, stem, of, a, vascular, plant, in, some, brown, algae, the, pith, region, includes, a, core, of, elongated, cells, that, resemble, the, phloem, of, vascular, plants, both, in, structure, and, function, in, others, such, as, nereocystis, the, center, of, the, stipe, is, hollow, and, filled, with, gas, that, serves, to, keep, that, part, of, the, alga, buoyant, the, stipe, may, be, relatively, flexible, and, elastic, in, species, like, macrocystis, pyrifera, that, grow, in, strong, currents, or, may, be, more, rigid, in, species, like, postelsia, palmaeformis, that, are, exposed, to, the, atmosphere, at, low, tide, many, algae, have, a, flattened, portion, that, may, resemble, a, leaf, and, this, is, termed, a, blade, lamina, or, frond, the, name, blade, is, most, often, applied, to, a, single, undivided, structure, while, frond, may, be, applied, to, all, or, most, of, an, algal, body, that, is, flattened, but, this, distinction, is, not, universally, applied, the, name, lamina, refers, to, that, portion, of, a, structurally, differentiated, alga, that, is, flattened, it, may, be, a, single, or, a, divided, structure, and, may, be, spread, over, a, substantial, portion, of, the, alga, in, rockweeds, for, example, the, lamina, is, a, broad, wing, of, tissue, that, runs, continuously, along, both, sides, of, a, branched, midrib, the, midrib, and, lamina, together, constitute, almost, all, of, a, rockweed, so, that, the, lamina, is, spread, throughout, the, alga, rather, than, existing, as, a, localized, portion, of, it, in, some, brown, algae, there, is, a, single, lamina, or, blade, while, in, others, there, may, be, many, separate, blades, even, in, those, species, that, initially, produce, a, single, blade, the, structure, may, tear, with, rough, currents, or, as, part, of, maturation, to, form, additional, blades, these, blades, may, be, attached, directly, to, the, stipe, to, a, holdfast, with, no, stipe, present, or, there, may, be, an, air, bladder, between, the, stipe, and, blade, the, surface, of, the, lamina, or, blade, may, be, smooth, or, wrinkled, its, tissues, may, be, thin, and, flexible, or, thick, and, leathery, in, species, like, egregia, menziesii, this, characteristic, may, change, depending, upon, the, turbulence, of, the, waters, in, which, it, grows, in, other, species, the, surface, of, the, blade, is, coated, with, slime, to, discourage, the, attachment, of, epiphytes, or, to, deter, herbivores, blades, are, also, often, the, parts, of, the, alga, that, bear, the, reproductive, structures, gas, filled, floats, called, pneumatocysts, provide, buoyancy, in, many, kelps, and, members, of, the, fucales, these, bladder, like, structures, occur, in, or, near, the, lamina, so, that, it, is, held, nearer, the, water, surface, and, thus, receives, more, light, for, photosynthesis, pneumatocysts, are, most, often, spherical, or, ellipsoidal, but, can, vary, in, shape, among, different, species, species, such, as, nereocystis, luetkeana, and, pelagophycus, porra, bear, a, single, large, pneumatocyst, between, the, top, of, the, stipe, and, the, base, of, the, blades, in, contrast, the, giant, kelp, macrocystis, pyrifera, bears, many, blades, along, its, stipe, with, a, pneumatocyst, at, the, base, of, each, blade, where, it, attaches, to, the, main, stipe, species, of, sargassum, also, bear, many, blades, and, pneumatocysts, but, both, kinds, of, structures, are, attached, separately, to, the, stipe, by, short, stalks, in, species, of, fucus, the, pneumatocysts, develop, within, the, lamina, itself, either, as, discrete, spherical, bladders, or, as, elongated, gas, filled, regions, that, take, the, outline, of, the, lamina, in, which, they, develop, the, brown, algae, include, the, largest, and, fastest, growing, of, seaweeds, fronds, of, macrocystis, may, grow, as, much, as, 50, cm, 20, in, per, day, and, the, stipes, can, grow, 6, cm, 2, 4, in, in, a, single, day, growth, in, most, brown, algae, occurs, at, the, tips, of, structures, as, a, result, of, divisions, in, a, single, apical, cell, or, in, a, row, of, such, cells, they, are, single, cellular, organisms, as, this, apical, cell, divides, the, new, cells, that, it, produces, develop, into, all, the, tissues, of, the, alga, branchings, and, other, lateral, structures, appear, when, the, apical, cell, divides, to, produce, two, new, apical, cells, however, a, few, groups, such, as, ectocarpus, grow, by, a, diffuse, unlocalized, production, of, new, cells, that, can, occur, anywhere, on, the, thallus, the, simplest, brown, algae, are, filamentous, that, is, their, cells, are, elongate, and, have, septa, cutting, across, their, width, they, branch, by, getting, wider, at, their, tip, and, then, dividing, the, widening, these, filaments, may, be, haplostichous, or, polystichous, multiaxial, or, monoaxial, forming, or, not, a, pseudoparenchyma, besides, fronds, there, are, the, large, in, size, parenchyma, tic, kelps, with, three, dimensional, development, and, growth, and, different, tissues, meristoderm, cortex, and, medulla, which, could, be, consider, the, trees, of, the, sea, there, are, also, the, fucales, and, dictyotales, smaller, than, kelps, but, still, parenchymatic, with, the, same, kind, of, distinct, tissues, the, cell, wall, consists, of, two, layers, the, inner, layer, bears, the, strength, and, consists, of, cellulose, the, outer, wall, layer, is, mainly, algin, and, is, gummy, when, wet, but, becomes, hard, and, brittle, when, it, dries, out, specifically, the, brown, algal, cell, wall, consists, of, several, components, with, alginates, and, sulphated, fucan, being, its, main, ingredients, up, to, 40, each, of, them, cellulose, a, major, component, from, most, plant, cell, walls, is, present, in, a, very, small, percentage, up, to, 8, cellulose, and, alginate, biosynthesis, pathways, seem, to, have, been, acquired, from, other, organisms, through, endosymbiotic, and, horizontal, gene, transfer, respectively, while, the, sulphated, polysaccharides, are, of, ancestral, origin, specifically, the, cellulose, synthases, seem, to, come, from, the, red, alga, endosymbiont, of, the, photosynthetic, stramenopiles, ancestor, and, the, ancestor, of, brown, algae, acquired, the, key, enzymes, for, alginates, biosynthesis, from, an, actinobacterium, the, presence, and, fine, control, of, alginate, structure, in, combination, with, the, cellulose, which, existed, before, it, gave, potentially, the, brown, algae, the, ability, to, develop, complex, structurally, multicellular, organisms, like, the, kelps, genetic, and, ultrastructural, evidence, place, the, phaeophyceae, among, the, heterokonts, stramenopiles, a, large, assemblage, of, organisms, that, includes, both, photosynthetic, members, with, plastids, such, as, the, diatoms, as, well, as, non, photosynthetic, groups, such, as, the, slime, nets, and, water, molds, although, some, heterokont, relatives, of, the, brown, algae, lack, plastids, in, their, cells, scientists, believe, this, is, a, result, of, evolutionary, loss, of, that, organelle, in, those, groups, rather, than, independent, acquisition, by, the, several, photosynthetic, members, thus, all, heterokonts, are, believed, to, descend, from, a, single, heterotrophic, ancestor, that, became, photosynthetic, when, it, acquired, plastids, through, endosymbiosis, of, another, unicellular, eukaryote, the, closest, relatives, of, the, brown, algae, include, unicellular, and, filamentous, species, but, no, unicellular, species, of, brown, algae, are, known, however, most, scientists, assume, that, the, phaeophyceae, evolved, from, unicellular, ancestors, dna, sequence, comparison, also, suggests, that, the, brown, algae, evolved, from, the, filamentous, phaeothamniophyceae, xanthophyceae, or, the, chrysophyceae, between, 150, and, 200, million, years, ago, in, many, ways, the, evolution, of, the, brown, algae, parallels, that, of, the, green, algae, and, red, algae, as, all, three, groups, possess, complex, multicellular, species, with, an, alternation, of, generations, analysis, of, 5s, rrna, sequences, reveals, much, smaller, evolutionary, distances, among, genera, of, the, brown, algae, than, among, genera, of, red, or, green, algae, which, suggests, that, the, brown, algae, have, diversified, much, more, recently, than, the, other, two, groups, the, occurrence, of, phaeophyceae, as, fossils, is, rare, due, to, their, generally, soft, bodied, nature, and, scientists, continue, to, debate, the, identification, of, some, finds, part, of, the, problem, with, identification, lies, in, the, convergent, evolution, of, morphologies, between, many, brown, and, red, algae, most, fossils, of, soft, tissue, algae, preserve, only, a, flattened, outline, without, the, microscopic, features, that, permit, the, major, groups, of, multicellular, algae, to, be, reliably, distinguished, among, the, brown, algae, only, species, of, the, genus, padina, deposit, significant, quantities, of, minerals, in, or, around, their, cell, walls, other, algal, groups, such, as, the, red, algae, and, green, algae, have, a, number, of, calcareous, members, because, of, this, they, are, more, likely, to, leave, evidence, in, the, fossil, record, than, the, soft, bodies, of, most, brown, algae, and, more, often, can, be, precisely, classified, fossils, comparable, in, morphology, to, brown, algae, are, known, from, strata, as, old, as, the, upper, ordovician, but, the, taxonomic, affinity, of, these, impression, fossils, is, far, from, certain, claims, that, earlier, ediacaran, fossils, are, brown, algae, have, since, been, dismissed, while, many, carbonaceous, fossils, have, been, described, from, the, precambrian, they, are, typically, preserved, as, flattened, outlines, or, fragments, measuring, only, millimeters, long, because, these, fossils, lack, features, diagnostic, for, identification, at, even, the, highest, level, they, are, assigned, to, fossil, form, taxa, according, to, their, shape, and, other, gross, morphological, features, a, number, of, devonian, fossils, termed, fucoids, from, their, resemblance, in, outline, to, species, in, the, genus, fucus, have, proven, to, be, inorganic, rather, than, true, fossils, the, devonian, megafossil, prototaxites, which, consists, of, masses, of, filaments, grouped, into, trunk, like, axes, has, been, considered, a, possible, brown, alga, however, modern, research, favors, reinterpretation, of, this, fossil, as, a, terrestrial, fungus, or, fungal, like, organism, likewise, the, fossil, protosalvinia, was, once, considered, a, possible, brown, alga, but, is, now, thought, to, be, an, early, land, plant, a, number, of, paleozoic, fossils, have, been, tentatively, classified, with, the, brown, algae, although, most, have, also, been, compared, to, known, red, algae, species, phascolophyllaphycus, possesses, numerous, elongate, inflated, blades, attached, to, a, stipe, it, is, the, most, abundant, of, algal, fossils, found, in, a, collection, made, from, carboniferous, strata, in, illinois, each, hollow, blade, bears, up, to, eight, pneumatocysts, at, its, base, and, the, stipes, appear, to, have, been, hollow, and, inflated, as, well, this, combination, of, characteristics, is, similar, to, certain, modern, genera, in, the, order, laminariales, kelps, several, fossils, of, drydenia, and, a, single, specimen, of, hungerfordia, from, the, upper, devonian, of, new, york, have, also, been, compared, to, both, brown, and, red, algae, fossils, of, drydenia, consist, of, an, elliptical, blade, attached, to, a, branching, filamentous, holdfast, not, unlike, some, species, of, laminaria, porphyra, or, gigartina, the, single, known, specimen, of, hungerfordia, branches, dichotomously, into, lobes, and, resembles, genera, like, chondrus, and, fucus, or, dictyota, the, earliest, known, fossils, that, can, be, assigned, reliably, to, the, phaeophyceae, come, from, miocene, diatomite, deposits, of, the, monterey, formation, in, california, several, soft, bodied, brown, macroalgae, such, as, julescraneia, have, been, found, based, on, the, work, of, silberfeld, rousseau, de, reviers, 2014, choristocarpaceae, discosporangiaceae, ishigeaceae, petrodermataceae, onslowiales, dictyotales,

chordaceae, alariaceae, agaraceae, laminariaceae, asterocladales, adenocystaceae, scytosiphonaceae, petrospongiaceae, ectocarpaceae, acinetosporaceae, chordariaceae, this, is, a, list, of, the, orders, in, the, class, phaeophyceae, most, brown, algae, with, the, exception, of, the, fucales, perform, sexual, reproduction, through, sporic, meiosis, between, generations, the, algae, go, through, separate, sporophyte, diploid, and, gametophyte, haploid, phases, the, sporophyte, stage, is, often, the, more, visible, of, the, two, though, some, species, of, brown, algae, have, similar, diploid, and, haploid, phases, free, floating, forms, of, brown, algae, often, do, not, undergo, sexual, reproduction, until, they, attach, themselves, to, substrate, the, haploid, generation, consists, of, male, and, female, gametophytes, the, fertilization, of, egg, cells, varies, between, species, of, brown, algae, and, may, be, isogamous, oogamous, or, anisogamous, fertilization, may, take, place, in, the, water, with, eggs, and, motile, sperm, or, within, the, oogonium, itself, certain, species, of, brown, algae, can, also, perform, asexual, reproduction, through, the, production, of, motile, diploid, zoospores, these, zoospores, form, in, plurilocular, sporangium, and, can, mature, into, the, sporophyte, phase, immediately, in, a, representative, species, laminaria, there, is, a, conspicuous, diploid, generation, and, smaller, haploid, generations, meiosis, takes, place, within, several, unilocular, sporangium, along, the, algae, s, blade, each, one, forming, either, haploid, male, or, female, zoospores, the, spores, are, then, released, from, the, sporangia, and, grow, to, form, male, and, female, gametophytes, the, female, gametophyte, produces, an, egg, in, the, oogonium, and, the, male, gametophyte, releases, motile, sperm, that, fertilize, the, egg, the, fertilized, zygote, then, grows, into, the, mature, diploid, sporophyte, in, the, order, fucales, sexual, reproduction, is, oogamous, and, the, mature, diploid, is, the, only, form, for, each, generation, gametes, are, formed, in, specialized, conceptacles, that, occur, scattered, on, both, surfaces, of, the, receptacle, the, outer, portion, of, the, blades, of, the, parent, plant, egg, cells, and, motile, sperm, are, released, from, separate, sacs, within, the, conceptacles, of, the, parent, algae, combining, in, the, water, to, complete, fertilization, the, fertilized, zygote, settles, onto, a, surface, and, then, differentiates, into, a, leafy, thallus, and, a, finger, like,

including, the, tidal, splash, zone, rock, pools, the, whole, intertidal, zone, and, relatively, deep, near, shore, waters, they, are, an, important, constituent, of, some, brackish, water, ecosystems, and, have, colonized, freshwater, on, a, minimum, of, six, known, occasions, a, large, number, of, phaeophyceae, are, intertidal, or, upper, littoral, and, they, are, predominantly, cool, and, cold, water, organisms, that, benefit, from, nutrients, in, up, welling, cold, water, currents, and, inflows, from, land, sargassum, being, a, prominent, exception, to, this, generalisation, brown, algae, growing, in, brackish, waters, are, almost, solely, asexual, brown, algae, have, a, 13, c, value, in, the, range, of, 30, 0, to, 10, 5, in, contrast, with, red, algae, and, greens, this, reflects, their, different, metabolic, pathways, they, have, cellulose, walls, with, alginic, acid, and, also, contain, the, polysaccharide, fucoidan, in, the, amorphous, sections, of, their, cell, walls, a, few, species, of, padina, calcify, with, aragonite, needles, in, addition, to, alginates, fucoidan, and, cellulose, the, carbohydrate, composition, of, brown, algae, consists, of, mannitol, laminarin, and, glucan, the, photosynthetic, system, of, brown, algae, is, made, of, a, p700, complex, containing, chlorophyll, a, their, plastids, also, contain, chlorophyll, c, and, carotenoids, the, most, widespread, of, those, being, fucoxanthin, brown, algae, produce, a, specific, type, of, tannin, called, phlorotannins, in, higher, amounts, than, red, algae, do, brown, algae, include, a, number, of, edible, seaweeds, all, brown, algae, contain, alginic, acid, alginate, in, their, cell, walls, which, is, extracted, commercially, and, used, as, an, industrial, thickening, agent, in, food, and, for, other, uses, one, of, these, products, is, used, in, lithium, ion, batteries, alginic, acid, is, used, as, a, stable, component, of, a, battery, anode, this, polysaccharide, is, a, major, component, of, brown, algae, and, is, not, found, in, land, plants, alginic, acid, can, also, be, used, in, aquaculture, for, example, alginic, acid, enhances, the, immune, system, of, rainbow, trout, younger, fish, are, more, likely, to, survive, when, given, a, diet, with, alginic, acid, brown, algae, including, kelp, beds, also, fix, a, significant, portion, of, the, earth, s, carbon, dioxide, yearly, through, photosynthesis, additionally, they, can, store, a, great, amount, of, carbon, dioxide, which, can, help, us, in, the, fight, against, climate, change, sargachromanol, g, an,
