miller, notes, that, while, pepper, was, grown, in, southern, thailand, and, in, malaysia, its, most, important, source, was, india, particularly, the, malabar, coast, in, what, is, now, the, state, of, kerala, the, lost, ancient, port, city, of, muziris, in, kerala, famous, for, exporting, black, pepper, and, various, other, spices, gets, mentioned, in, a, number, of, classical, historical, sources, for, its, trade, with, roman, empire, egypt, mesopotamia, levant, and, yemen, peppercorns, were, a, much, prized, trade, good, often, referred, to, as, black, gold, and, used, as, a, form, of, commodity, money, the, legacy, of, this, trade, remains, in, some, western, legal, systems, that, recognize, the, term, peppercorn, rent, as, a, token, payment, for, something, that, is, essentially, a, gift, the, ancient, history, of, black, pepper, is, often, interlinked, with, and, confused, with, that, of, long, pepper, the, dried, fruit, of, closely, related, piper, longum, the, romans, knew, of, both, and, often, referred, to, either, as, just, piper, in, fact, the, popularity, of, long, pepper, did, not, entirely, decline, until, the, discovery, of, the, new, world, and, of, chili, peppers, chili, peppers, some, of, which, when, dried, are, similar, in, shape, and, taste, to, long, pepper, were, easier, to, grow, in, a, variety, of, locations, more, convenient, to, europe, before, the, 16th, century, pepper, was, being, grown, in, java, sunda, sumatra, madagascar, malaysia, and, everywhere, in, southeast, asia, these, areas, traded, mainly, with, china, or, used, the, pepper, locally, ports, in, the, malabar, area, also, served, as, a, stop, off, point, for, much, of, the, trade, in, other, spices, from, farther, east, in, the, indian, ocean, black, peppercorns, were, found, stuffed, in, the, nostrils, of, ramesses, ii, placed, there, as, part, of, the, mummification, rituals, shortly, after, his, death, in, 1213, bce, little, else, is, known, about, the, use, of, pepper, in, ancient, egypt, and, how, it, reached, the, nile, from, the, malabar, coast, of, south, asia, pepper, both, long, and, black, was, known, in, greece, at, least, as, early, as, the, fourth, century, bce, though, it, was, probably, an, uncommon, and, expensive, item, that, only, the, very, rich, could, afford, by, the, time, of, the, early, roman, empire, especially, after, rome, s, conquest, of, egypt, in, 30, bce, open, ocean, crossing, of, the, arabian, sea, direct, to, chera, dynasty, southern, india, s, malabar, coast, was, near, routine, details, of, this, trading, across, the, indian, ocean, have, been, passed, down, in, the, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, according, to, the, greek, geographer, strabo, the, early, empire, sent, a, fleet, of, around, 120, ships, on, an, annual, trip, to, india, and, back, the, fleet, timed, its, travel, across, the, arabian, sea, to, take, advantage, of, the, predictable, monsoon, winds, returning, from, india, the, ships, travelled, up, the, red, sea, from, where, the, cargo, was, carried, overland, or, via, the, nile, red, sea, canal, to, the, nile, river, barged, to, alexandria, and, shipped, from, there, to, italy, and, rome, the, rough, geographical, outlines, of, this, same, trade, route, would, dominate, the, pepper, trade, into, europe, for, a, millennium, and, a, half, to, come, with, ships, sailing, directly, to, the, malabar, coast, malabar, black, pepper, was, now, travelling, a, shorter, trade, route, than, long, pepper, and, the, prices, reflected, it, pliny, the, elder, s, natural, history, tells, us, the, prices, in, rome, around, 77, ce, long, pepper, is, 15, denarii, per, pound, while, that, of, white, pepper, is, seven, and, of, black, four, pliny, also, complains, there, is, no, year, in, which, india, does, not, drain, the, roman, empire, of, 50, million, sesterces, and, further, moralizes, on, pepper, it, is, quite, surprising, that, the, use, of, pepper, has, come, so, much, into, fashion, seeing, that, in, other, substances, which, we, use, it, is, sometimes, their, sweetness, and, sometimes, their, appearance, that, has, attracted, our, notice, whereas, pepper, has, nothing, in, it, that, can, plead, as, a, recommendation, to, either, fruit, or, berry, its, only, desirable, quality, being, a, certain, pungency, and, yet, it, is, for, this, that, we, import, it, all, the, way, from, india, who, was, the, first, to, make, trial, of, it, as, an, article, of, food, and, who, i, wonder, was, the, man, that, was, not, content, to, prepare, himself, by, hunger, only, for, the, satisfying, of, a, greedy, appetite, he, does, not, state, whether, the, 50, million, was, the, actual, amount, of, money, which, found, its, way, to, india, or, the, total, retail, cost, of, the, items, in, rome, and, elsewhere, he, cites, a, figure, of, 100, million, sesterces, black, pepper, was, a, well, known, and, widespread, if, expensive, seasoning, in, the, roman, empire, apicius, de, re, coquinaria, a, third, century, cookbook, probably, based, at, least, partly, on, one, from, the, first, century, ce, includes, pepper, in, a, majority, of, its, recipes, edward, gibbon, wrote, in, the, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, that, pepper, was, a, favorite, ingredient, of, the, most, expensive, roman, cookery, pepper, was, so, valuable, that, it, was, often, used, as, collateral, or, even, currency, the, taste, for, pepper, or, the, appreciation, of, its, monetary, value, was, passed, on, to, those, who, would, see, rome, fall, alaric, king, of, the, visigoths, included, 3, 000, pounds, of, pepper, as, part, of, the, ransom, he, demanded, from, rome, when, he, besieged, the, city, in, the, fifth, century, after, the, fall, of, rome, others, took, over, the, middle, legs, of, the, spice, trade, first, the, persians, and, then, the, arabs, innes, miller, cites, the, account, of, cosmas, indicopleustes, who, travelled, east, to, india, as, proof, that, pepper, was, still, being, exported, from, india, in, the, sixth, century, by, the, end, of, the, early, middle, ages, the, central, portions, of, the, spice, trade, were, firmly, under, islamic, control, once, into, the, mediterranean, the, trade, was, largely, monopolized, by, italian, powers, especially, venice, and, genoa, the, rise, of, these, city, states, was, funded, in, large, part, by, the, spice, trade, a, riddle, authored, by, saint, aldhelm, a, seventh, century, bishop, of, sherborne, sheds, some, light, on, black,

rattled, by, my, gleaming, marrow, it, is, commonly, believed, that, during, the, middle, ages, pepper, was, often, used, to, conceal, the, taste, of, partially, rotten, meat, no, evidence, supports, this, claim, and, historians, view, it, as, highly, unlikely, in, the, middle, ages, pepper, was, a, luxury, item, affordable, only, to, the, wealthy, who, certainly, had, unspoiled, meat, available, as, well, in, addition, people, of, the, time, certainly, knew, that, eating, spoiled, food, would, make, them, sick, similarly, the, belief, that, pepper, was, widely, used, as, a, preservative, is, questionable, it, is, true, that, piperine, the, compound, that, gives, pepper, its, spiciness, has, some, antimicrobial, properties, but, at, the, concentrations, present, when, pepper, is, used, as, a, spice, the, effect, is, small, salt, is, a, much, more, effective, preservative, and, salt, cured, meats, were, common, fare, especially, in, winter, however, pepper, and, other, spices, certainly, played, a, role, in, improving, the, taste, of, long, preserved, meats, archaeological, evidence, of, pepper, consumption, in, late, medieval, northern, europe, comes, from, excavations, on, the, danish, norwegian, flagship, gribshunden, which, sank, in, the, summer, of, 1495, in, 2021, archaeologists, recovered, more, than, 2000, peppercorns, from, the, wreck, along, with, a, variety, of, other, spices, and, exotic, foodstuffs, including, clove, ginger, saffron, and, almond, the, ship, was, carrying, king, hans, to, a, political, summit, at, the, time, of, its, loss, the, spices, were, likely, intended, for, feasts, at, the, summit, which, would, have, included, the, danish, norwegian, and, swedish, councils, of, state, its, exorbitant, price, during, the, middle, ages, and, the, monopoly, on, the, trade, held, by, venice, was, one, of, the, inducements, that, led, the, portuguese, to, seek, a, sea, route, to, india, in, 1498, vasco, da, gama, became, the, first, person, to, reach, india, by, sailing, around, africa, see, age, of, discovery, asked, by, arabs, in, calicut, who, spoke, spanish, and, italian, why, they, had, come, his, representative, replied, we, seek, christians, and, spices, though, this, first, trip, to, india, by, way, of, the, southern, tip, of, africa, was, only, a, modest, success, the, portuguese, quickly, returned, in, greater, numbers, and, eventually, gained, much, greater, control, of, trade, on, the, arabian, sea, the, 1494, treaty, of, tordesillas, granted, portugal, exclusive, rights, to, the, half, of, the, world, where, black, pepper, originated, however, the, portuguese, monopolized, the, spice, trade, for, 150, years, portuguese, even, became, the, lingua, franca, of, the, then, known, world, the, spice, trade, made, portugal, rich, however, in, the, 17th, century, the, portuguese, lost, most, of, their, valuable, indian, ocean, trade, to, the, dutch, and, the, english, who, taking, advantage, of, the, spanish, rule, over, portugal, during, the, iberian, union, 1580, 1640, occupied, by, force, almost, all, portuguese, interests, in, the, area, the, pepper, ports, of, malabar, began, to, trade, increasingly, with, the, dutch, in, the, period, 1661, 1663, 7, as, pepper, supplies, into, europe, increased, the, price, of, pepper, declined, though, the, total, value, of, the, import, trade, generally, did, not, pepper, which, in, the, early, middle, ages, had, been, an, item, exclusively, for, the, rich, started, to, become, more, of, an, everyday, seasoning, among, those, of, more, average, means, today, pepper, accounts, for, one, fifth, of, the, world, s, spice, trade, it, is, possible, that, black, pepper, was, known, in, china, in, the, second, century, bce, if, poetic, reports, regarding, an, explorer, named, tang, meng, are, correct, sent, by, emperor, wu, to, what, is, now, south, west, china, tang, meng, is, said, to, have, come, across, something, called, jujiang, or, sauce, betel, he, was, told, it, came, from, the, markets, of, shu, an, area, in, what, is, now, the, sichuan, province, the, traditional, view, among, historians, is, that, sauce, betel, is, a, sauce, made, from, betel, leaves, but, arguments, have, been, made, that, it, actually, refers, to, pepper, either, long, or, black, in, the, third, century, ce, black, pepper, made, its, first, definite, appearance, in, chinese, texts, as, hujiao, or, foreign, pepper, it, does, not, appear, to, have, been, widely, known, at, the, time, failing, to, appear, in, a, fourth, century, work, describing, a, wide, variety, of, spices, from, beyond, china, s, southern, border, including, long, pepper, by, the, 12th, century, however, black, pepper, had, become, a, popular, ingredient, in, the, cuisine, of, the, wealthy, and, powerful, sometimes, taking, the, place, of, china, s, native, sichuan, pepper, the, tongue, numbing, dried, fruit, of, an, unrelated, plant, marco, polo,
