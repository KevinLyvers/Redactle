parasitism, is, a, close, relationship, between, species, where, one, organism, the, parasite, lives, on, or, inside, another, organism, the, host, causing, it, some, harm, and, is, adapted, structurally, to, this, way, of, life, the, entomologist, e, o, wilson, characterised, parasites, as, predators, that, eat, prey, in, units, of, less, than, one, parasites, include, single, celled, protozoans, such, as, the, agents, of, malaria, sleeping, sickness, and, amoebic, dysentery, animals, such, as, hookworms, lice, mosquitoes, and, vampire, bats, fungi, such, as, honey, fungus, and, the, agents, of, ringworm, and, plants, such, as, mistletoe, dodder, and, the, broomrapes, there, are, six, major, parasitic, strategies, of, exploitation, of, animal, hosts, namely, parasitic, castration, directly, transmitted, parasitism, by, contact, trophically, transmitted, parasitism, by, being, eaten, vector, transmitted, parasitism, parasitoidism, and, micropredation, one, major, axis, of, classification, concerns, invasiveness, an, endoparasite, lives, inside, the, host, s, body, an, ectoparasite, lives, outside, on, the, host, s, surface, like, predation, parasitism, is, a, type, of, consumer, resource, interaction, but, unlike, predators, parasites, with, the, exception, of, parasitoids, are, typically, much, smaller, than, their, hosts, do, not, kill, them, and, often, live, in, or, on, their, hosts, for, an, extended, period, parasites, of, animals, are, highly, specialised, and, reproduce, at, a, faster, rate, than, their, hosts, classic, examples, include, interactions, between, vertebrate, hosts, and, tapeworms, flukes, the, malaria, causing, plasmodium, species, and, fleas, parasites, reduce, host, fitness, by, general, or, specialised, pathology, from, parasitic, castration, to, modification, of, host, behaviour, parasites, increase, their, own, fitness, by, exploiting, hosts, for, resources, necessary, for, their, survival, in, particular, by, feeding, on, them, and, by, using, intermediate, secondary, hosts, to, assist, in, their, transmission, from, one, definitive, primary, host, to, another, although, parasitism, is, often, unambiguous, it, is, part, of, a, spectrum, of, interactions, between, species, grading, via, parasitoidism, into, predation, through, evolution, into, mutualism, and, in, some, fungi, shading, into, being, saprophytic, people, have, known, about, parasites, such, as, roundworms, and, tapeworms, since, ancient, egypt, greece, and, rome, in, early, modern, times, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, observed, giardia, lamblia, in, his, microscope, in, 1681, while, francesco, redi, described, internal, and, external, parasites, including, sheep, liver, fluke, and, ticks, modern, parasitology, developed, in, the, 19th, century, in, human, culture, parasitism, has, negative, connotations, these, were, exploited, to, satirical, effect, in, jonathan, swift, s, 1733, poem, on, poetry, a, rhapsody, comparing, poets, to, hyperparasitical, vermin, in, fiction, bram, stoker, s, 1897, gothic, horror, novel, dracula, and, its, many, later, adaptations, featured, a, blood, drinking, parasite, ridley, scott, s, 1979, film, alien, was, one, of, many, works, of, science, fiction, to, feature, a, parasitic, alien, species, first, used, in, english, in, 1539, the, word, parasite, comes, from, the, medieval, french, parasite, from, the, latinised, form, parasitus, from, ancient, greek, parasitos, one, who, eats, at, the, table, of, another, in, turn, from, para, beside, by, and, sitos, wheat, food, the, related, term, parasitism, appears, in, english, from, 1611, parasitism, is, a, kind, of, symbiosis, a, close, and, persistent, long, term, biological, interaction, between, a, parasite, and, its, host, unlike, saprotrophs, parasites, feed, on, living, hosts, though, some, parasitic, fungi, for, instance, may, continue, to, feed, on, hosts, they, have, killed, unlike, commensalism, and, mutualism, the, parasitic, relationship, harms, the, host, either, feeding, on, it, or, as, in, the, case, of, intestinal, parasites, consuming, some, of, its, food, because, parasites, interact, with, other, species, they, can, readily, act, as, vectors, of, pathogens, causing, disease, predation, is, by, definition, not, a, symbiosis, as, the, interaction, is, brief, but, the, entomologist, e, o, wilson, has, characterised, parasites, as, predators, that, eat, prey, in, units, of, less, than, one, within, that, scope, are, many, possible, strategies, taxonomists, classify, parasites, in, a, variety, of, overlapping, schemes, based, on, their, interactions, with, their, hosts, and, on, their, life, cycles, which, are, sometimes, very, complex, an, obligate, parasite, depends, completely, on, the, host, to, complete, its, life, cycle, while, a, facultative, parasite, does, not, parasite, life, cycles, involving, only, one, host, are, called, direct, those, with, a, definitive, host, where, the, parasite, reproduces, sexually, and, at, least, one, intermediate, host, are, called, indirect, an, endoparasite, lives, inside, the, host, s, body, an, ectoparasite, lives, outside, on, the, host, s, surface, mesoparasites, like, some, copepods, for, example, enter, an, opening, in, the, host, s, body, and, remain, partly, embedded, there, some, parasites, can, be, generalists, feeding, on, a, wide, range, of, hosts, but, many, parasites, and, the, majority, of, protozoans, and, helminths, that, parasitise, animals, are, specialists, and, extremely, host, specific, an, early, basic, functional, division, of, parasites, distinguished, microparasites, and, macroparasites, these, each, had, a, mathematical, model, assigned, in, order, to, analyse, the, population, movements, of, the, host, parasite, groupings, the, microorganisms, and, viruses, that, can, reproduce, and, complete, their, life, cycle, within, the, host, are, known, as, microparasites, macroparasites, are, the, multicellular, organisms, that, reproduce, and, complete, their, life, cycle, outside, of, the, host, or, on, the, host, s, body, much, of, the, thinking, on, types, of, parasitism, has, focused, on, terrestrial, animal, parasites, of, animals, such, as, helminths, those, in, other, environments, and, with, other, hosts, often, have, analogous, strategies, for, example, the, snubnosed, eel, is, probably, a, facultative, endoparasite, i, e, it, is, semiparasitic, that, opportunistically, burrows, into, and, eats, sick, and, dying, fish, plant, eating, insects, such, as, scale, insects, aphids, and, caterpillars, closely, resemble, ectoparasites, attacking, much, larger, plants, they, serve, as, vectors, of, bacteria, fungi, and, viruses, which, cause, plant, diseases, as, female, scale, insects, cannot, move, they, are, obligate, parasites, permanently, attached, to, their, hosts, the, sensory, inputs, that, a, parasite, employs, to, identify, and, approach, a, potential, host, are, known, as, host, cues, such, cues, can, include, for, example, vibration, exhaled, carbon, dioxide, skin, odours, visual, and, heat, signatures, and, moisture, parasitic, plants, can, use, for, example, light, host, physiochemistry, and, volatiles, to, recognize, potential, hosts, there, are, six, major, parasitic, strategies, namely, parasitic, castration, directly, transmitted, parasitism, trophically, transmitted, parasitism, vector, transmitted, parasitism, parasitoidism, and, micropredation, these, apply, to, parasites, whose, hosts, are, plants, as, well, as, animals, these, strategies, represent, adaptive, peaks, intermediate, strategies, are, possible, but, organisms, in, many, different, groups, have, consistently, converged, on, these, six, which, are, evolutionarily, stable, a, perspective, on, the, evolutionary, options, can, be, gained, by, considering, four, key, questions, the, effect, on, the, fitness, of, a, parasite, s, hosts, the, number, of, hosts, they, have, per, life, stage, whether, the, host, is, prevented, from, reproducing, and, whether, the, effect, depends, on, intensity, number, of, parasites, per, host, from, this, analysis, the, major, evolutionary, strategies, of, parasitism, emerge, alongside, predation, parasitic, castrators, partly, or, completely, destroy, their, host, s, ability, to, reproduce, diverting, the, energy, that, would, have, gone, into, reproduction, into, host, and, parasite, growth, sometimes, causing, gigantism, in, the, host, the, host, s, other, systems, remain, intact, allowing, it, to, survive, and, to, sustain, the, parasite, parasitic, crustaceans, such, as, those, in, the, specialised, barnacle, genus, sacculina, specifically, cause, damage, to, the, gonads, of, their, many, species, of, host, crabs, in, the, case, of, sacculina, the, testes, of, over, two, thirds, of, their, crab, hosts, degenerate, sufficiently, for, these, male, crabs, to, develop, female, secondary, sex, characteristics, such, as, broader, abdomens, smaller, claws, and, egg, grasping, appendages, various, species, of, helminth, castrate, their, hosts, such, as, insects, and, snails, this, may, happen, directly, whether, mechanically, by, feeding, on, their, gonads, or, by, secreting, a, chemical, that, destroys, reproductive, cells, or, indirectly, whether, by, secreting, a, hormone, or, by, diverting, nutrients, for, example, the, trematode, zoogonus, lasius, whose, sporocysts, lack, mouths, castrates, the, intertidal, marine, snail, tritia, obsoleta, chemically, developing, in, its, gonad, and, killing, its, reproductive, cells, directly, transmitted, parasites, not, requiring, a, vector, to, reach, their, hosts, include, such, parasites, of, terrestrial, vertebrates, as, lice, and, mites, marine, parasites, such, as, copepods, and, cyamid, amphipods, monogeneans, and, many, species, of, nematodes, fungi, protozoans, bacteria, and, viruses, whether, endoparasites, or, ectoparasites, each, has, a, single, host, species, within, that, species, most, individuals, are, free, or, almost, free, of, parasites, while, a, minority, carry, a, large, number, of, parasites, this, is, known, as, an, aggregated, distribution, trophically, transmitted, parasites, are, transmitted, by, being, eaten, by, a, host, they, include, trematodes, all, except, schistosomes, cestodes, acanthocephalans, pentastomids, many, roundworms, and, many, protozoa, such, as, toxoplasma, they, have, complex, life, cycles, involving, hosts, of, two, or, more, species, in, their, juvenile, stages, they, infect, and, often, encyst, in, the, intermediate, host, when, the, intermediate, host, animal, is, eaten, by, a, predator, the, definitive, host, the, parasite, survives, the, digestion, process, and, matures, into, an, adult, some, live, as, intestinal, parasites, many, trophically, transmitted, parasites, modify, the, behaviour, of, their, intermediate, hosts, increasing, their, chances, of, being, eaten, by, a, predator, as, with, directly, transmitted, parasites, the, distribution, of, trophically, transmitted, parasites, among, host, individuals, is, aggregated, coinfection, by, multiple, parasites, is, common, autoinfection, where, by, exception, the, whole, of, the, parasite, s, life, cycle, takes, place, in, a, single, primary, host, can, sometimes, occur, in, helminths, such, as, strongyloides, stercoralis, vector, transmitted, parasites, rely, on, a, third, party, an, intermediate, host, where, the, parasite, does, not, reproduce, sexually, to, carry, them, from, one, definitive, host, to, another, these, parasites, are, microorganisms, namely, protozoa, bacteria, or, viruses, often, intracellular, pathogens, disease, causers, their, vectors, are, mostly, hematophagic, arthropods, such, as, fleas, lice, ticks, and, mosquitoes, for, example, the, deer, tick, ixodes, scapularis, acts, as, a, vector, for, diseases, including, lyme, disease, babesiosis, and, anaplasmosis, protozoan, endoparasites, such, as, the, malarial, parasites, in, the, genus, plasmodium, and, sleeping, sickness, parasites, in, the, genus, trypanosoma, have, infective, stages, in, the, host, s, blood, which, are, transported, to, new, hosts, by, biting, insects, parasitoids, are, insects, which, sooner, or, later, kill, their, hosts, placing, their, relationship, close, to, predation, most, parasitoids, are, parasitoid, wasps, or, other, hymenopterans, others, include, dipterans, such, as, phorid, flies, they, can, be, divided, into, two, groups, idiobionts, and, koinobionts, differing, in, their, treatment, of, their, hosts, idiobiont, parasitoids, sting, their, often, large, prey, on, capture, either, killing, them, outright, or, paralysing, them, immediately, the, immobilised, prey, is, then, carried, to, a, nest, sometimes, alongside, other, prey, if, it, is, not, large, enough, to, support, a, parasitoid, throughout, its, development, an, egg, is, laid, on, top, of, the, prey, and, the, nest, is, then, sealed, the, parasitoid, develops, rapidly, through, its, larval, and, pupal, stages, feeding, on, the, provisions, left, for, it, koinobiont, parasitoids, which, include, flies, as, well, as, wasps, lay, their, eggs, inside, young, hosts, usually, larvae, these, are, allowed, to, go, on, growing, so, the, host, and, parasitoid, develop, together, for, an, extended, period, ending, when, the, parasitoids, emerge, as, adults, leaving, the, prey, dead, eaten, from, inside, some, koinobionts, regulate, their, host, s, development, for, example, preventing, it, from, pupating, or, making, it, moult, whenever, the, parasitoid, is, ready, to, moult, they, may, do, this, by, producing, hormones, that, mimic, the, host, s, moulting, hormones, ecdysteroids, or, by, regulating, the, host, s, endocrine, system, a, micropredator, attacks, more, than, one, host, reducing, each, host, s, fitness, by, at, least, a, small, amount, and, is, only, in, contact, with, any, one, host, intermittently, this, behavior, makes, micropredators, suitable, as, vectors, as, they, can, pass, smaller, parasites, from, one, host, to, another, most, micropredators, are, hematophagic, feeding, on, blood, they, include, annelids, such, as, leeches, crustaceans, such, as, branchiurans, and, gnathiid, isopods, various, dipterans, such, as, mosquitoes, and, tsetse, flies, other, arthropods, such, as, fleas, and, ticks, vertebrates, such, as, lampreys, and, mammals, such, as, vampire, bats, parasites, use, a, variety, of, methods, to, infect, animal, hosts, including, physical, contact, the, fecal, oral, route, free, living, infectious, stages, and, vectors, suiting, their, differing, hosts, life, cycles, and, ecological, contexts, examples, to, illustrate, some, of, the, many, possible, combinations, are, given, in, the, table, social, behaviour, grooming, among, the, many, variations, on, parasitic, strategies, are, hyperparasitism, social, parasitism, brood, parasitism, kleptoparasitism, sexual, parasitism, and, adelphoparasitism, hyperparasites, feed, on, another, parasite, as, exemplified, by, protozoa, living, in, helminth, parasites, or, facultative, or, obligate, parasitoids, whose, hosts, are, either, conventional, parasites, or, parasitoids, levels, of, parasitism, beyond, secondary, also, occur, especially, among, facultative, parasitoids, in, oak, gall, systems, there, can, be, up, to, five, levels, of, parasitism, hyperparasites, can, control, their, hosts, populations, and, are, used, for, this, purpose, in, agriculture, and, to, some, extent, in, medicine, the, controlling, effects, can, be, seen, in, the, way, that, the, chv1, virus, helps, to, control, the, damage, that, chestnut, blight, cryphonectria, parasitica, does, to, american, chestnut, trees, and, in, the, way, that, bacteriophages, can, limit, bacterial, infections, it, is, likely, though, little, researched, that, most, pathogenic, microparasites, have, hyperparasites, which, may, prove, widely, useful, in, both, agriculture, and, medicine, social, parasites, take, advantage, of, interspecific, interactions, between, members, of, eusocial, animals, such, as, ants, termites, and, bumblebees, examples, include, the, large, blue, butterfly, phengaris, arion, its, larvae, employing, ant, mimicry, to, parasitise, certain, ants, bombus, bohemicus, a, bumblebee, which, invades, the, hives, of, other, bees, and, takes, over, reproduction, while, their, young, are, raised, by, host, workers, and, melipona, scutellaris, a, eusocial, bee, whose, virgin, queens, escape, killer, workers, and, invade, another, colony, without, a, queen, an, extreme, example, of, interspecific, social, parasitism, is, found, in, the, ant, tetramorium, inquilinum, an, obligate, parasite, which, lives, exclusively, on, the, backs, of, other, tetramorium, ants, a, mechanism, for, the, evolution, of, social, parasitism, was, first, proposed, by, carlo, emery, in, 1909, now, known, as, emery, s, rule, it, states, that, social, parasites, tend, to, be, closely, related, to, their, hosts, often, being, in, the, same, genus, intraspecific, social, parasitism, occurs, in, parasitic, nursing, where, some, individual, young, take, milk, from, unrelated, females, in, wedge, capped, capuchins, higher, ranking, females, sometimes, take, milk, from, low, ranking, females, without, any, reciprocation, in, brood, parasitism, the, hosts, act, as, parents, as, they, raise, the, young, as, their, own, brood, parasites, include, birds, in, different, families, such, as, cowbirds, whydahs, cuckoos, and, black, headed, ducks, these, do, not, build, nests, of, their, own, but, leave, their, eggs, in, nests, of, other, species, the, eggs, of, some, brood, parasites, mimic, those, of, their, hosts, while, some, cowbird, eggs, have, tough, shells, making, them, hard, for, the, hosts, to, kill, by, piercing, both, mechanisms, implying, selection, by, the, hosts, against, parasitic, eggs, the, adult, female, european, cuckoo, further, mimics, a, predator, the, european, sparrowhawk, giving, her, time, to, lay, her, eggs, in, the, host, s, nest, unobserved, in, kleptoparasitism, from, greek, klept, s, thief, parasites, steal, food, gathered, by, the, host, the, parasitism, is, often, on, close, relatives, whether, within, the, same, species, or, between, species, in, the, same, genus, or, family, for, instance, the, many, lineages, of, cuckoo, bees, lay, their, eggs, in, the, nest, cells, of, other, bees, in, the, same, family, kleptoparasitism, is, uncommon, generally, but, conspicuous, in, birds, some, such, as, skuas, are, specialised, in, pirating, food, from, other, seabirds, relentlessly, chasing, them, down, until, they, disgorge, their, catch, a, unique, approach, is, seen, in, some, species, of, anglerfish, such, as, ceratias, holboelli, where, the, males, are, reduced, to, tiny, sexual, parasites, wholly, dependent, on, females, of, their, own, species, for, survival, permanently, attached, below, the, female, s, body, and, unable, to, fend, for, themselves, the, female, nourishes, the, male, and, protects, him, from, predators, while, the, male, gives, nothing, back, except, the, sperm, that, the, female, needs, to, produce, the, next, generation, adelphoparasitism, from, greek, adelph, s, brother, also, known, as, sibling, parasitism, occurs, where, the, host, species, is, closely, related, to, the, parasite, often, in, the, same, family, or, genus, in, the, citrus, blackfly, parasitoid, encarsia, perplexa, unmated, females, may, lay, haploid, eggs, in, the, fully, developed, larvae, of, their, own, species, producing, male, offspring, while, the, marine, worm, bonellia, viridis, has, a, similar, reproductive, strategy, although, the, larvae, are, planktonic, examples, of, the, major, variant, strategies, are, illustrated, parasitism, has, an, extremely, wide, taxonomic, range, including, animals, plants, fungi, protozoans, bacteria, and, viruses, parasitism, is, widespread, in, the, animal, kingdom, and, has, evolved, independently, from, free, living, forms, hundreds, of, times, many, types, of, helminth, including, flukes, and, cestodes, have, complete, life, cycles, involving, two, or, more, hosts, by, far, the, largest, group, is, the, parasitoid, wasps, in, the, hymenoptera, the, phyla, and, classes, with, the, largest, numbers, of, parasitic, species, are, listed, in, the, table, numbers, are, conservative, minimum, estimates, the, columns, for, endo, and, ecto, parasitism, refer, to, the, definitive, host, as, documented, in, the, vertebrate, and, invertebrate, columns, a, hemiparasite, or, partial, parasite, such, as, mistletoe, derives, some, of, its, nutrients, from, another, living, plant, whereas, a, holoparasite, such, as, dodder, derives, all, of, its, nutrients, from, another, plant, parasitic, plants, make, up, about, one, per, cent, of, angiosperms, and, are, in, almost, every, biome, in, the, world, all, these, plants, have, modified, roots, haustoria, which, penetrate, the, host, plants, connecting, them, to, the, conductive, system, either, the, xylem, the, phloem, or, both, this, provides, them, with, the, ability, to, extract, water, and, nutrients, from, the, host, a, parasitic, plant, is, classified, depending, on, where, it, latches, onto, the, host, either, the, stem, or, the, root, and, the, amount, of, nutrients, it, requires, since, holoparasites, have, no, chlorophyll, and, therefore, cannot, make, food, for, themselves, by, photosynthesis, they, are, always, obligate, parasites, deriving, all, their, food, from, their, hosts, some, parasitic, plants, can, locate, their, host, plants, by, detecting, chemicals, in, the, air, or, soil, given, off, by, host, shoots, or, roots, respectively, about, 4, 500, species, of, parasitic, plant, in, approximately, 20, families, of, flowering, plants, are, known, species, within, the, orobanchaceae, broomrapes, are, among, the, most, economically, destructive, of, all, plants, species, of, striga, witchweeds, are, estimated, to, cost, billions, of, dollars, a, year, in, crop, yield, loss, infesting, over, 50, million, hectares, of, cultivated, land, within, sub, saharan, africa, alone, striga, infects, both, grasses, and, grains, including, corn, rice, and, sorghum, which, are, among, the, world, s, most, important, food, crops, orobanche, also, threatens, a, wide, range, of, other, important, crops, including, peas, chickpeas, tomatoes, carrots, and, varieties, of, cabbage, yield, loss, from, orobanche, can, be, total, despite, extensive, research, no, method, of, control, has, been, entirely, successful, many, plants, and, fungi, exchange, carbon, and, nutrients, in, mutualistic, mycorrhizal, relationships, some, 400, species, of, myco, heterotrophic, plants, mostly, in, the, tropics, however, effectively, cheat, by, taking, carbon, from, a, fungus, rather, than, exchanging, it, for, minerals, they, have, much, reduced, roots, as, they, do, not, need, to, absorb, water, from, the, soil, their, stems, are, slender, with, few, vascular, bundles, and, their, leaves, are, reduced, to, small, scales, as, they, do, not, photosynthesize, their, seeds, are, very, small, and, numerous, so, they, appear, to, rely, on, being, infected, by, a, suitable, fungus, soon, after, germinating, parasitic, fungi, derive, some, or, all, of, their, nutritional, requirements, from, plants, other, fungi, or, animals, plant, pathogenic, fungi, are, classified, into, three, categories, depending, on, their, mode, of, nutrition, biotrophs, hemibiotrophs, and, necrotrophs, biotrophic, fungi, derive, nutrients, from, living, plant, cells, and, during, the, course, of, infection, they, colonise, their, plant, host, in, such, a, way, as, to, keep, it, alive, for, a, maximally, long, time, one, well, known, example, of, a, biotrophic, pathogen, is, ustilago, maydis, causative, agent, of, the, corn, smut, disease, necrotrophic, pathogens, on, the, other, hand, kill, host, cells, and, feed, saprophytically, an, example, being, the, root, colonising, honey, fungi, in, the, genus, armillaria, hemibiotrophic, pathogens, begin, their, colonising, their, hosts, as, biotrophs, and, subsequently, killing, off, host, cells, and, feeding, as, necrotrophs, a, phenomenon, termed, the, biotrophy, necrotrophy, switch, pathogenic, fungi, are, well, known, causative, agents, of, diseases, on, animals, as, well, as, humans, fungal, infections, mycosis, are, estimated, to, kill, 1, 6, million, people, each, year, one, example, of, a, potent, fungal, animal, pathogen, are, microsporidia, obligate, intracellular, parasitic, fungi, that, largely, affect, insects, but, may, also, affect, vertebrates, including, humans, causing, the, intestinal, infection, microsporidiosis, protozoa, such, as, plasmodium, trypanosoma, and, entamoeba, are, endoparasitic, they, cause, serious, diseases, in, vertebrates, including, humans, in, these, examples, malaria, sleeping, sickness, and, amoebic, dysentery, and, have, complex, life, cycles, many, bacteria, are, parasitic, though, they, are, more, generally, thought, of, as, pathogens, causing, disease, parasitic, bacteria, are, extremely, diverse, and, infect, their, hosts, by, a, variety, of, routes, to, give, a, few, examples, bacillus, anthracis, the, cause, of, anthrax, is, spread, by, contact, with, infected, domestic, animals, its, spores, which, can, survive, for, years, outside, the, body, can, enter, a, host, through, an, abrasion, or, may, be, inhaled, borrelia, the, cause, of, lyme, disease, and, relapsing, fever, is, transmitted, by, vectors, ticks, of, the, genus, ixodes, from, the, diseases, reservoirs, in, animals, such, as, deer, campylobacter, jejuni, a, cause, of, gastroenteritis, is, spread, by, the, fecal, oral, route, from, animals, or, by, eating, insufficiently, cooked, poultry, or, by, contaminated, water, haemophilus, influenzae, an, agent, of, bacterial, meningitis, and, respiratory, tract, infections, such, as, influenza, and, bronchitis, is, transmitted, by, droplet, contact, treponema, pallidum, the, cause, of, syphilis, is, spread, by, sexual, activity, viruses, are, obligate, intracellular, parasites, characterised, by, extremely, limited, biological, function, to, the, point, where, while, they, are, evidently, able, to, infect, all, other, organisms, from, bacteria, and, archaea, to, animals, plants, and, fungi, it, is, unclear, whether, they, can, themselves, be, described, as, living, they, can, be, either, rna, or, dna, viruses, consisting, of, a, single, or, double, strand, of, genetic, material, rna, or, dna, respectively, covered, in, a, protein, coat, and, sometimes, a, lipid, envelope, they, thus, lack, all, the, usual, machinery, of, the, cell, such, as, enzymes, relying, entirely, on, the, host, cell, s, ability, to, replicate, dna, and, synthesise, proteins, most, viruses, are, bacteriophages, infecting, bacteria, parasitism, is, a, major, aspect, of, evolutionary, ecology, for, example, almost, all, free, living, animals, are, host, to, at, least, one, species, of, parasite, vertebrates, the, best, studied, group, are, hosts, to, between, 75, 000, and, 300, 000, species, of, helminths, and, an, uncounted, number, of, parasitic, microorganisms, on, average, a, mammal, species, hosts, four, species, of, nematode, two, of, trematodes, and, two, of, cestodes, humans, have, 342, species, of, helminth, parasites, and, 70, species, of, protozoan, parasites, some, three, quarters, of, the, links, in, food, webs, include, a, parasite, important, in, regulating, host, numbers, perhaps, 40, per, cent, of, described, species, are, parasitic, parasitism, is, hard, to, demonstrate, from, the, fossil, record, but, holes, in, the, mandibles, of, several, specimens, of, tyrannosaurus, may, have, been, caused, by, trichomonas, like, parasites, saurophthirus, the, early, cretaceous, flea, parasitized, pterosaurs, eggs, that, belonged, to, nematode, worms, and, probably, protozoan, cysts, were, found, in, the, late, triassic, coprolite, of, phytosaur, this, rare, find, in, thailand, reveals, more, about, the, ecology, of, prehistoric, parasites, as, hosts, and, parasites, evolve, together, their, relationships, often, change, when, a, parasite, is, in, a, sole, relationship, with, a, host, selection, drives, the, relationship, to, become, more, benign, even, mutualistic, as, the, parasite, can, reproduce, for, longer, if, its, host, lives, longer, but, where, parasites, are, competing, selection, favours, the, parasite, that, reproduces, fastest, leading, to, increased, virulence, there, are, thus, varied, possibilities, in, host, parasite, coevolution, evolutionary, epidemiology, analyses, how, parasites, spread, and, evolve, whereas, darwinian, medicine, applies, similar, evolutionary, thinking, to, non, parasitic, diseases, like, cancer, and, autoimmune, conditions, long, term, coevolution, sometimes, leads, to, a, relatively, stable, relationship, tending, to, commensalism, or, mutualism, as, all, else, being, equal, it, is, in, the, evolutionary, interest, of, the, parasite, that, its, host, thrives, a, parasite, may, evolve, to, become, less, harmful, for, its, host, or, a, host, may, evolve, to, cope, with, the, unavoidable, presence, of, a, parasite, to, the, point, that, the, parasite, s, absence, causes, the, host, harm, for, example, although, animals, parasitised, by, worms, are, often, clearly, harmed, such, infections, may, also, reduce, the, prevalence, and, effects, of, autoimmune, disorders, in, animal, hosts, including, humans, in, a, more, extreme, example, some, nematode, worms, cannot, reproduce, or, even, survive, without, infection, by, wolbachia, bacteria, lynn, margulis, and, others, have, argued, following, peter, kropotkin, s, 1902, mutual, aid, a, factor, of, evolution, that, natural, selection, drives, relationships, from, parasitism, to, mutualism, when, resources, are, limited, this, process, may, have, been, involved, in, the, symbiogenesis, which, formed, the, eukaryotes, from, an, intracellular, relationship, between, archaea, and, bacteria, though, the, sequence, of, events, remains, largely, undefined, competition, between, parasites, can, be, expected, to, favour, faster, reproducing, and, therefore, more, virulent, parasites, by, natural, selection, among, competing, parasitic, insect, killing, bacteria, of, the, genera, photorhabdus, and, xenorhabdus, virulence, depended, on, the, relative, potency, of, the, antimicrobial, toxins, bacteriocins, produced, by, the, two, strains, involved, when, only, one, bacterium, could, kill, the, other, the, other, strain, was, excluded, by, the, competition, but, when, caterpillars, were, infected, with, bacteria, both, of, which, had, toxins, able, to, kill, the, other, strain, neither, strain, was, excluded, and, their, virulence, was, less, than, when, the, insect, was, infected, by, a, single, strain, a, parasite, sometimes, undergoes, cospeciation, with, its, host, resulting, in, the, pattern, described, in, fahrenholz, s, rule, that, the, phylogenies, of, the, host, and, parasite, come, to, mirror, each, other, an, example, is, between, the, simian, foamy, virus, sfv, and, its, primate, hosts, the, phylogenies, of, sfv, polymerase, and, the, mitochondrial, cytochrome, c, oxidase, subunit, ii, from, african, and, asian, primates, were, found, to, be, closely, congruent, in, branching, order, and, divergence, times, implying, that, the, simian, foamy, viruses, cospeciated, with, old, world, primates, for, at, least, 30, million, years, the, presumption, of, a, shared, evolutionary, history, between, parasites, and, hosts, can, help, elucidate, how, host, taxa, are, related, for, instance, there, has, been, a, dispute, about, whether, flamingos, are, more, closely, related, to, storks, or, ducks, the, fact, that, flamingos, share, parasites, with, ducks, and, geese, was, initially, taken, as, evidence, that, these, groups, were, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, either, is, to, storks, however, evolutionary, events, such, as, the, duplication, or, the, extinction, of, parasite, species, without, similar, events, on, the, host, phylogeny, often, erode, similarities, between, host, and, parasite, phylogenies, in, the, case, of, flamingos, they, have, similar, lice, to, those, of, grebes, flamingos, and, grebes, do, have, a, common, ancestor, implying, cospeciation, of, birds, and, lice, in, these, groups, flamingo, lice, then, switched, hosts, to, ducks, creating, the, situation, which, had, confused, biologists, parasites, infect, sympatric, hosts, those, within, their, same, geographical, area, more, effectively, as, has, been, shown, with, digenetic, trematodes, infecting, lake, snails, this, is, in, line, with, the, red, queen, hypothesis, which, states, that, interactions, between, species, lead, to, constant, natural, selection, for, coadaptation, parasites, track, the, locally, common, hosts, phenotypes, so, the, parasites, are, less, infective, to, allopatric, hosts, those, from, different, geographical, regions, some, parasites, modify, host, behaviour, in, order, to, increase, their, transmission, between, hosts, often, in, relation, to, predator, and, prey, parasite, increased, trophic, transmission, for, example, in, the, california, coastal, salt, marsh, the, fluke, euhaplorchis, californiensis, reduces, the, ability, of, its, killifish, host, to, avoid, predators, this, parasite, matures, in, egrets, which, are, more, likely, to, feed, on, infected, killifish, than, on, uninfected, fish, another, example, is, the, protozoan, toxoplasma, gondii, a, parasite, that, matures, in, cats, but, can, be, carried, by, many, other, mammals, uninfected, rats, avoid, cat, odors, but, rats, infected, with, t, gondii, are, drawn, to, this, scent, which, may, increase, transmission, to, feline, hosts, the, malaria, parasite, modifies, the, skin, odour, of, its, human, hosts, increasing, their, attractiveness, to, mosquitoes, and, hence, improving, the, chance, that, the, parasite, will, be, transmitted, the, spider, cyclosa, argenteoalba, often, have, parasitoid, wasp, larvae, attached, to, them, which, alter, their, web, building, behavior, instead, of, producing, their, normal, sticky, spiral, shaped, webs, they, made, simplified, webs, when, the, parasites, were, attached, this, manipulated, behavior, lasted, longer, and, was, more, prominent, the, longer, the, parasites, were, left, on, the, spiders, parasites, can, exploit, their, hosts, to, carry, out, a, number, of, functions, that, they, would, otherwise, have, to, carry, out, for, themselves, parasites, which, lose, those, functions, then, have, a, selective, advantage, as, they, can, divert, resources, to, reproduction, many, insect, ectoparasites, including, bedbugs, batbugs, lice, and, fleas, have, lost, their, ability, to, fly, relying, instead, on, their, hosts, for, transport, trait, loss, more, generally, is, widespread, among, parasites, an, extreme, example, is, the, myxosporean, henneguya, zschokkei, an, ectoparasite, of, fish, and, the, only, animal, known, to, have, lost, the, ability, to, respire, aerobically, its, cells, lack, mitochondria, hosts, have, evolved, a, variety, of, defensive, measures, against, their, parasites, including, physical, barriers, like, the, skin, of, vertebrates, the, immune, system, of, mammals, insects, actively, removing, parasites, and, defensive, chemicals, in, plants, the, evolutionary, biologist, w, d, hamilton, suggested, that, sexual, reproduction, could, have, evolved, to, help, to, defeat, multiple, parasites, by, enabling, genetic, recombination, the, shuffling, of, genes, to, create, varied, combinations, hamilton, showed, by, mathematical, modelling, that, sexual, reproduction, would, be, evolutionarily, stable, in, different, situations, and, that, the, theory, s, predictions, matched, the, actual, ecology, of, sexual, reproduction, however, there, may, be, a, trade, off, between, immunocompetence, and, breeding, male, vertebrate, hosts, secondary, sex, characteristics, such, as, the, plumage, of, peacocks, and, the, manes, of, lions, this, is, because, the, male, hormone, testosterone, encourages, the, growth, of, secondary, sex, characteristics, favouring, such, males, in, sexual, selection, at, the, price, of, reducing, their, immune, defences, the, physical, barrier, of, the, tough, and, often, dry, and, waterproof, skin, of, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, keeps, invading, microorganisms, from, entering, the, body, human, skin, also, secretes, sebum, which, is, toxic, to, most, microorganisms, on, the, other, hand, larger, parasites, such, as, trematodes, detect, chemicals, produced, by, the, skin, to, locate, their, hosts, when, they, enter, the, water, vertebrate, saliva, and, tears, contain, lysozyme, an, enzyme, that, breaks, down, the, cell, walls, of, invading, bacteria, should, the, organism, pass, the, mouth, the, stomach, with, its, hydrochloric, acid, toxic, to, most, microorganisms, is, the, next, line, of, defence, some, intestinal, parasites, have, a, thick, tough, outer, coating, which, is, digested, slowly, or, not, at, all, allowing, the, parasite, to, pass, through, the, stomach, alive, at, which, point, they, enter, the, intestine, and, begin, the, next, stage, of, their, life, once, inside, the, body, parasites, must, overcome, the, immune, system, s, serum, proteins, and, pattern, recognition, receptors, intracellular, and, cellular, that, trigger, the, adaptive, immune, system, s, lymphocytes, such, as, t, cells, and, antibody, producing, b, cells, these, have, receptors, that, recognise, parasites, insects, often, adapt, their, nests, to, reduce, parasitism, for, example, one, of, the, key, reasons, why, the, wasp, polistes, canadensis, nests, across, multiple, combs, rather, than, building, a, single, comb, like, much, of, the, rest, of, its, genus, is, to, avoid, infestation, by, tineid, moths, the, tineid, moth, lays, its, eggs, within, the, wasps, nests, and, then, these, eggs, hatch, into, larvae, that, can, burrow, from, cell, to, cell, and, prey, on, wasp, pupae, adult, wasps, attempt, to, remove, and, kill, moth, eggs, and, larvae, by, chewing, down, the, edges, of, cells, coating, the, cells, with, an, oral, secretion, that, gives, the, nest, a, dark, brownish, appearance, plants, respond, to, parasite, attack, with, a, series, of, chemical, defences, such, as, polyphenol, oxidase, under, the, control, of, the, jasmonic, acid, insensitive, ja, and, salicylic, acid, sa, signalling, pathways, the, different, biochemical, pathways, are, activated, by, different, attacks, and, the, two, pathways, can, interact, positively, or, negatively, in, general, plants, can, either, initiate, a, specific, or, a, non, specific, response, specific, responses, involve, recognition, of, a, parasite, by, the, plant, s, cellular, receptors, leading, to, a, strong, but, localised, response, defensive, chemicals, are, produced, around, the, area, where, the, parasite, was, detected, blocking, its, spread, and, avoiding, wasting, defensive, production, where, it, is, not, needed, non, specific, defensive, responses, are, systemic, meaning, that, the, responses, are, not, confined, to, an, area, of, the, plant, but, spread, throughout, the, plant, making, them, costly, in, energy, these, are, effective, against, a, wide, range, of, parasites, when, damaged, such, as, by, lepidopteran, caterpillars, leaves, of, plants, including, maize, and, cotton, release, increased, amounts, of, volatile, chemicals, such, as, terpenes, that, signal, they, are, being, attacked, one, effect, of, this, is, to, attract, parasitoid, wasps, which, in, turn, attack, the, caterpillars, parasitism, and, parasite, evolution, were, until, the, twenty, first, century, studied, by, parasitologists, in, a, science, dominated, by, medicine, rather, than, by, ecologists, or, evolutionary, biologists, even, though, parasite, host, interactions, were, plainly, ecological, and, important, in, evolution, the, history, of, parasitology, caused, what, the, evolutionary, ecologist, robert, poulin, called, a, takeover, of, parasitism, by, parasitologists, leading, ecologists, to, ignore, the, area, this, was, in, his, opinion, unfortunate, as, parasites, are, omnipresent, agents, of, natural, selection, and, significant, forces, in, evolution, and, ecology, in, his, view, the, long, standing, split, between, the, sciences, limited, the, exchange, of, ideas, with, separate, conferences, and, separate, journals, the, technical, languages, of, ecology, and, parasitology, sometimes, involved, different, meanings, for, the, same, words, there, were, philosophical, differences, too, poulin, notes, that, influenced, by, medicine, many, parasitologists, accepted, that, evolution, led, to, a, decrease, in, parasite, virulence, whereas, modern, evolutionary, theory, would, have, predicted, a, greater, range, of, outcomes, their, complex, relationships, make, parasites, difficult, to, place, in, food, webs, a, trematode, with, multiple, hosts, for, its, various, life, cycle, stages, would, occupy, many, positions, in, a, food, web, simultaneously, and, would, set, up, loops, of, energy, flow, confusing, the, analysis, further, since, nearly, every, animal, has, multiple, parasites, parasites, would, occupy, the, top, levels, of, every, food, web, parasites, can, play, a, role, in, the, proliferation, of, non, native, species, for, example, invasive, green, crabs, are, minimally, affected, by, native, trematodes, on, the, eastern, atlantic, coast, this, helps, them, outcompete, native, crabs, such, as, the, atlantic, rock, and, jonah, crabs, ecological, parasitology, can, be, important, to, attempts, at, control, like, during, the, campaign, for, eradicating, the, guinea, worm, even, though, the, parasite, was, eradicated, in, all, but, four, countries, the, worm, began, using, frogs, as, an, intermediary, host, before, infecting, dogs, making, control, more, difficult, than, it, would, have, been, if, the, relationships, had, been, better, understood, although, parasites, are, widely, considered, to, be, harmful, the, eradication, of, all, parasites, would, not, be, beneficial, parasites, account, for, at, least, half, of, life, s, diversity, they, perform, important, ecological, roles, and, without, parasites, organisms, might, tend, to, asexual, reproduction, diminishing, the, diversity, of, traits, brought, about, by, sexual, reproduction, parasites, provide, an, opportunity, for, the, transfer, of, genetic, material, between, species, facilitating, evolutionary, change, many, parasites, require, multiple, hosts, of, different, species, to, complete, their, life, cycles, and, rely, on, predator, prey, or, other, stable, ecological, interactions, to, get, from, one, host, to, another, the, presence, of, parasites, thus, indicates, that, an, ecosystem, is, healthy, an, ectoparasite, the, california, condor, louse, colpocephalum, californici, became, a, well, known, conservation, issue, a, major, and, very, costly, captive, breeding, program, was, run, in, the, united, states, to, rescue, the, california, condor, it, was, host, to, a, louse, which, lived, only, on, it, any, lice, found, were, deliberately, killed, during, the, program, to, keep, the, condors, in, the, best, possible, health, the, result, was, that, one, species, the, condor, was, saved, and, returned, to, the, wild, while, another, species, the, parasite, became, extinct, although, parasites, are, often, omitted, in, depictions, of, food, webs, they, usually, occupy, the, top, position, parasites, can, function, like, keystone, species, reducing, the, dominance, of, superior, competitors, and, allowing, competing, species, to, co, exist, a, single, parasite, species, usually, has, an, aggregated, distribution, across, host, animals, which, means, that, most, hosts, carry, few, parasites, while, a, few, hosts, carry, the, vast, majority, of, parasite, individuals, this, poses, considerable, problems, for, students, of, parasite, ecology, as, it, renders, parametric, statistics, as, commonly, used, by, biologists, invalid, log, transformation, of, data, before, the, application, of, parametric, test, or, the, use, of, non, parametric, statistics, is, recommended, by, several, authors, but, this, can, give, rise, to, further, problems, so, quantitative, parasitology, is, based, on, more, advanced, biostatistical, methods, human, parasites, including, roundworms, the, guinea, worm, threadworms, and, tapeworms, are, mentioned, in, egyptian, papyrus, records, from, 3000, bc, onwards, the, ebers, papyrus, describes, hookworm, in, ancient, greece, parasites, including, the, bladder, worm, are, described, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, while, the, comic, playwright, aristophanes, called, tapeworms, hailstones, the, roman, physicians, celsus, and, galen, documented, the, roundworms, ascaris, lumbricoides, and, enterobius, vermicularis, in, his, canon, of, medicine, completed, in, 1025, the, persian, physician, avicenna, recorded, human, and, animal, parasites, including, roundworms, threadworms, the, guinea, worm, and, tapeworms, in, his, 1397, book, trait, de, l, tat, science, et, pratique, de, l, art, de, la, bergerie, account, of, the, state, science, and, practice, of, the, art, of, shepherding, jehan, de, brie, wrote, the, first, description, of, a, trematode, endoparasite, the, sheep, liver, fluke, fasciola, hepatica, in, the, early, modern, period, francesco, redi, s, 1668, book, esperienze, intorno, alla, generazione, degl, insetti, experiences, of, the, generation, of, insects, explicitly, described, ecto, and, endoparasites, illustrating, ticks, the, larvae, of, nasal, flies, of, deer, and, sheep, liver, fluke, redi, noted, that, parasites, develop, from, eggs, contradicting, the, theory, of, spontaneous, generation, in, his, 1684, book, osservazioni, intorno, agli, animali, viventi, che, si, trovano, negli, animali, viventi, observations, on, living, animals, found, in, living, animals, redi, described, and, illustrated, over, 100, parasites, including, the, large, roundworm, in, humans, that, causes, ascariasis, redi, was, the, first, to, name, the, cysts, of, echinococcus, granulosus, seen, in, dogs, and, sheep, as, parasitic, a, century, later, in, 1760, peter, simon, pallas, correctly, suggested, that, these, were, the, larvae, of, tapeworms, in, 1681, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, observed, and, illustrated, the, protozoan, parasite, giardia, lamblia, and, linked, it, to, his, own, loose, stools, this, was, the, first, protozoan, parasite, of, humans, to, be, seen, under, a, microscope, a, few, years, later, in, 1687, the, italian, biologists, giovanni, cosimo, bonomo, and, diacinto, cestoni, described, scabies, as, caused, by, the, parasitic, mite, sarcoptes, scabiei, marking, it, as, the, first, disease, of, humans, with, a, known, microscopic, causative, agent, modern, parasitology, developed, in, the, 19th, century, with, accurate, observations, and, experiments, by, many, researchers, and, clinicians, the, term, was, first, used, in, 1870, in, 1828, james, annersley, described, amoebiasis, protozoal, infections, of, the, intestines, and, the, liver, though, the, pathogen, entamoeba, histolytica, was, not, discovered, until, 1873, by, friedrich, l, sch, james, paget, discovered, the, intestinal, nematode, trichinella, spiralis, in, humans, in, 1835, james, mcconnell, described, the, human, liver, fluke, clonorchis, sinensis, in, 1875, algernon, thomas, and, rudolf, leuckart, independently, made, the, first, discovery, of, the, life, cycle, of, a, trematode, the, sheep, liver, fluke, by, experiment, in, 1881, 1883, in, 1877, patrick, manson, discovered, the, life, cycle, of, the, filarial, worms, that, cause, elephantiasis, transmitted, by, mosquitoes, manson, further, predicted, that, the, malaria, parasite, plasmodium, had, a, mosquito, vector, and, persuaded, ronald, ross, to, investigate, ross, confirmed, that, the, prediction, was, correct, in, 1897, 1898, at, the, same, time, giovanni, battista, grassi, and, others, described, the, malaria, parasite, s, life, cycle, stages, in, anopheles, mosquitoes, ross, was, controversially, awarded, the, 1902, nobel, prize, for, his, work, while, grassi, was, not, in, 1903, david, bruce, identified, the, protozoan, parasite, and, the, tsetse, fly, vector, of, african, trypanosomiasis, given, the, importance, of, malaria, with, some, 220, million, people, infected, annually, many, attempts, have, been, made, to, interrupt, its, transmission, various, methods, of, malaria, prophylaxis, have, been, tried, including, the, use, of, antimalarial, drugs, to, kill, off, the, parasites, in, the, blood, the, eradication, of, its, mosquito, vectors, with, organochlorine, and, other, insecticides, and, the, development, of, a, malaria, vaccine, all, of, these, have, proven, problematic, with, drug, resistance, insecticide, resistance, among, mosquitoes, and, repeated, failure, of, vaccines, as, the, parasite, mutates, the, first, and, as, of, 2015, the, only, licensed, vaccine, for, any, parasitic, disease, of, humans, is, rts, s, for, plasmodium, falciparum, malaria, several, groups, of, parasites, including, microbial, pathogens, and, parasitoidal, wasps, have, been, used, as, biological, control, agents, in, agriculture, and, horticulture, poulin, observes, that, the, widespread, prophylactic, use, of, anthelmintic, drugs, in, domestic, sheep, and, cattle, constitutes, a, worldwide, un, controlled, experiment, in, the, life, history, evolution, of, their, parasites, the, outcomes, depend, on, whether, the, drugs, decrease, the, chance, of, a, helminth, larva, reaching, adulthood, if, so, natural, selection, can, be, expected, to, favour, the, production, of, eggs, at, an, earlier, age, if, on, the, other, hand, the, drugs, mainly, affects, adult, parasitic, worms, selection, could, cause, delayed, maturity, and, increased, virulence, such, changes, appear, to, be, underway, the, nematode, teladorsagia, circumcincta, is, changing, its, adult, size, and, reproductive, rate, in, response, to, drugs, in, the, classical, era, the, concept, of, the, parasite, was, not, strictly, pejorative, the, parasitus, was, an, accepted, role, in, roman, society, in, which, a, person, could, live, off, the, hospitality, of, others, in, return, for, flattery, simple, services, and, a, willingness, to, endure, humiliation, parasitism, has, a, derogatory, sense, in, popular, usage, according, to, the, immunologist, john, playfair, in, everyday, speech, the, term, parasite, is, loaded, with, derogatory, meaning, a, parasite, is, a, sponger, a, lazy, profiteer, a, drain, on, society, the, satirical, cleric, jonathan, swift, alludes, to, hyperparasitism, in, his, 1733, poem, on, poetry, a, rhapsody, comparing, poets, to, vermin, who, teaze, and, pinch, their, foes, the, vermin, only, teaze, and, pinch, their, foes, superior, by, an, inch, so, nat, ralists, observe, a, flea, hath, smaller, fleas, that, on, him, prey, and, these, have, smaller, fleas, to, bite, em, and, so, proceeds, ad, infinitum, thus, every, poet, in, his, kind, is, bit, by, him, that, comes, behind, a, 2022, study, examined, the, naming, of, some, 3000, parasite, species, discovered, in, the, previous, two, decades, of, those, named, after, scientists, over, 80, were, named, for, men, whereas, about, a, third, of, authors, of, papers, on, parasites, were, women, the, study, found, that, the, percentage, of, parasite, species, named, for, relatives, or, friends, of, the, author, has, risen, sharply, in, the, same, period, in, bram, stoker, s, 1897, gothic, horror, novel, dracula, and, its, many, film, adaptations, the, eponymous, count, dracula, is, a, blood, drinking, parasite, a, vampire, the, critic, laura, otis, argues, that, as, a, thief, seducer, creator, and, mimic, dracula, is, the, ultimate, parasite, the, whole, point, of, vampirism, is, sucking, other, people, s, blood, living, at, other, people, s, expense, disgusting, and, terrifying, parasitic, alien, species, are, widespread, in, science, fiction, as, for, instance, in, ridley, scott, s, 1979, film, alien, in, one, scene, a, xenomorph, bursts, out, of, the, chest, of, a, dead, man, with, blood, squirting, out, under, high, pressure, assisted, by, explosive, squibs, animal, organs, were, used, to, reinforce, the, shock, effect, the, scene, was, filmed, in, a, single, take, and, the, startled, reaction, of, the, actors, was, genuine
