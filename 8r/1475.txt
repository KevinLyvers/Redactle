a, poison, is, any, chemical, substance, that, is, harmful, or, lethal, to, living, organisms, the, term, is, used, in, a, wide, range, of, scientific, fields, and, industries, where, it, is, often, specifically, defined, it, may, also, be, applied, colloquially, or, figuratively, with, a, broad, sense, whether, something, is, considered, a, poison, or, not, may, depend, on, the, amount, the, circumstances, and, what, living, things, are, present, poisoning, could, be, accidental, or, deliberate, and, if, the, cause, can, be, identified, there, may, be, ways, to, neutralise, the, effects, or, minimise, the, symptoms, in, biology, a, poison, is, a, chemical, substance, causing, death, injury, or, harm, to, organisms, or, their, parts, in, medicine, poisons, are, a, kind, of, toxin, that, are, delivered, passively, not, actively, in, industry, the, term, may, be, negative, something, to, be, removed, to, make, a, thing, safe, or, positive, an, agent, to, limit, unwanted, pests, in, ecological, terms, poisons, introduced, into, the, environment, can, later, cause, unwanted, effects, elsewhere, or, in, other, parts, of, the, food, chain, in, broad, metaphorical, colloquial, usage, of, the, term, poison, may, refer, to, anything, deemed, harmful, in, biology, poisons, are, substances, that, can, cause, death, injury, or, harm, to, organs, tissues, cells, and, dna, usually, by, chemical, reactions, or, other, activity, on, the, molecular, scale, when, an, organism, is, exposed, to, a, sufficient, quantity, medicinal, fields, particularly, veterinary, medicine, and, zoology, often, distinguish, poisons, from, toxins, and, venoms, both, poisons, and, venoms, are, toxins, which, are, toxicants, produced, by, organisms, in, nature, the, difference, between, venom, and, poison, is, the, delivery, method, of, the, toxin, venoms, are, toxins, that, are, actively, delivered, by, being, injected, via, a, bite, or, sting, through, a, venom, apparatus, such, as, fangs, or, a, stinger, in, a, process, called, envenomation, whereas, poisons, are, toxins, that, are, passively, delivered, by, being, swallowed, inhaled, or, absorbed, through, the, skin, industry, agriculture, and, other, sectors, employ, many, poisonous, substances, usually, for, reasons, other, than, their, toxicity, to, humans, e, g, feeding, chickens, arsenic, antihelminths, solvents, e, g, rubbing, alcohol, turpentine, cleaners, e, g, bleach, ammonia, coatings, e, g, arsenic, wallpaper, and, so, on, for, example, many, poisons, are, important, feedstocks, the, toxicity, itself, sometimes, has, economic, value, when, it, serves, agricultural, purposes, of, weed, control, and, pest, control, most, poisonous, industrial, compounds, have, associated, material, safety, data, sheets, and, are, classified, as, hazardous, substances, hazardous, substances, are, subject, to, extensive, regulation, on, production, procurement, and, use, in, overlapping, domains, of, occupational, safety, and, health, public, health, drinking, water, quality, standards, air, pollution, and, environmental, protection, due, to, the, mechanics, of, molecular, diffusion, many, poisonous, compounds, rapidly, diffuse, into, biological, tissues, air, water, or, soil, on, a, molecular, scale, by, the, principle, of, entropy, chemical, contamination, is, typically, costly, or, infeasible, to, reverse, unless, specific, chelating, agents, or, micro, filtration, processes, are, available, chelating, agents, are, often, broader, in, scope, than, the, acute, target, and, therefore, their, ingestion, necessitates, careful, medical, or, veterinarian, supervision, pesticides, are, one, group, of, substances, whose, prime, purpose, is, their, toxicity, to, various, insects, and, other, animals, deemed, to, be, pests, e, g, rats, and, cockroaches, natural, pesticides, have, been, used, for, this, purpose, for, thousands, of, years, e, g, concentrated, table, salt, is, toxic, to, many, slugs, and, snails, bioaccumulation, of, chemically, prepared, agricultural, insecticides, is, a, matter, of, concern, for, the, many, species, especially, birds, which, consume, insects, as, a, primary, food, source, selective, toxicity, controlled, application, and, controlled, biodegradation, are, major, challenges, in, herbicide, and, pesticide, development, and, in, chemical, engineering, generally, as, all, lifeforms, on, earth, share, an, underlying, biochemistry, organisms, exceptional, in, their, environmental, resilience, are, classified, as, extremophiles, these, for, the, most, part, exhibiting, radically, different, susceptibilities, a, poison, which, enters, the, food, chain, whether, of, industrial, agricultural, or, natural, origin, might, not, be, immediately, toxic, to, the, first, organism, that, ingests, the, toxin, but, can, become, further, concentrated, in, predatory, organisms, further, up, the, food, chain, particularly, carnivores, and, omnivores, especially, concerning, fat, soluble, poisons, which, tend, to, become, stored, in, biological, tissue, rather, than, excreted, in, urine, or, other, water, based, effluents, apart, from, food, many, poisons, readily, enter, the, body, through, the, skin, and, lungs, hydrofluoric, acid, is, a, notorious, contact, poison, in, addition, to, its, corrosive, damage, naturally, occurring, sour, gas, is, a, fast, acting, atmospheric, poison, which, can, be, released, by, volcanic, activity, or, drilling, rigs, plant, based, contact, irritants, such, as, that, possessed, by, poison, ivy, are, often, classed, as, allergens, rather, than, poisons, the, effect, of, an, allergen, being, not, a, poison, as, such, but, to, turn, the, body, s, natural, defenses, against, itself, poison, can, also, enter, the, body, through, faulty, medical, implants, or, by, injection, which, is, the, basis, of, lethal, injection, in, the, context, of, capital, punishment, in, 2013, 3, 3, million, cases, of, unintentional, human, poisonings, occurred, this, resulted, in, 98, 000, deaths, worldwide, down, from, 120, 000, deaths, in, 1990, in, modern, society, cases, of, suspicious, death, elicit, the, attention, of, the, coroner, s, office, and, forensic, investigators, of, increasing, concern, since, the, isolation, of, natural, radium, by, marie, and, pierre, curie, in, 1898, and, the, subsequent, advent, of, nuclear, physics, and, nuclear, technologies, are, radiological, poisons, these, are, associated, with, ionizing, radiation, a, mode, of, toxicity, quite, distinct, from, chemically, active, poisons, in, mammals, chemical, poisons, are, often, passed, from, mother, to, offspring, through, the, placenta, during, gestation, or, through, breast, milk, during, nursing, in, contrast, radiological, damage, can, be, passed, from, mother, or, father, to, offspring, through, genetic, mutation, which, if, not, fatal, in, miscarriage, or, childhood, or, a, direct, cause, of, infertility, can, then, be, passed, along, again, to, a, subsequent, generation, atmospheric, radon, is, a, natural, radiological, poison, of, increasing, impact, since, humans, moved, from, hunter, gatherer, lifestyles, and, cave, dwelling, to, increasingly, enclosed, structures, able, to, contain, radon, in, dangerous, concentrations, the, 2006, poisoning, of, alexander, litvinenko, was, a, notable, use, of, radiological, assassination, presumably, meant, to, evade, the, normal, investigation, of, chemical, poisons, poisons, widely, dispersed, into, the, environment, are, known, as, pollution, these, are, often, of, human, origin, but, pollution, can, also, include, unwanted, biological, processes, such, as, toxic, red, tide, or, acute, changes, to, the, natural, chemical, environment, attributed, to, invasive, species, which, are, toxic, or, detrimental, to, the, prior, ecology, especially, if, the, prior, ecology, was, associated, with, human, economic, value, or, an, established, industry, such, as, shellfish, harvesting, the, scientific, disciplines, of, ecology, and, environmental, resource, management, study, the, environmental, life, cycle, of, toxic, compounds, and, their, complex, diffuse, and, highly, interrelated, effects, the, word, poison, was, first, used, in, 1200, to, mean, a, deadly, potion, or, substance, the, english, term, comes, from, the, old, french, poison, puison, 12c, modern, french, poison, a, drink, especially, a, medical, drink, later, a, magic, potion, poisonous, drink, 14c, from, latin, potionem, nominative, potio, a, drinking, a, drink, also, poisonous, drink, cicero, from, potare, to, drink, the, use, of, poison, as, an, adjective, poisonous, dates, from, the, 1520s, using, the, word, poison, with, plant, names, dates, from, the, 18th, century, the, term, poison, ivy, for, example, was, first, used, in, 1784, and, the, term, poison, oak, was, first, used, in, 1743, the, term, poison, gas, was, first, used, in, 1915, the, term, poison, is, often, used, colloquially, to, describe, any, harmful, substance, particularly, corrosive, substances, carcinogens, mutagens, teratogens, and, harmful, pollutants, and, to, exaggerate, the, dangers, of, chemicals, paracelsus, 1493, 1541, the, father, of, toxicology, once, wrote, everything, is, poison, there, is, poison, in, everything, only, the, dose, makes, a, thing, not, a, poison, see, median, lethal, dose, the, term, poison, is, also, used, in, a, figurative, sense, his, brother, s, presence, poisoned, the, atmosphere, at, the, party, the, law, defines, poison, more, strictly, substances, not, legally, required, to, carry, the, label, poison, can, also, cause, a, medical, condition, of, poisoning, some, poisons, are, also, toxins, which, is, any, poison, produced, by, an, organism, such, as, the, bacterial, proteins, that, cause, tetanus, and, botulism, a, distinction, between, the, two, terms, is, not, always, observed, even, among, scientists, the, derivative, forms, toxic, and, poisonous, are, synonymous, animal, poisons, delivered, subcutaneously, e, g, by, sting, or, bite, are, also, called, venom, in, normal, usage, a, poisonous, organism, is, one, that, is, harmful, to, consume, but, a, venomous, organism, uses, venom, to, kill, its, prey, or, defend, itself, while, still, alive, a, single, organism, can, be, both, poisonous, and, venomous, but, it, is, rare, all, living, things, produce, substances, to, protect, them, from, getting, eaten, so, the, term, poison, is, usually, only, used, for, substances, which, are, poisonous, to, humans, while, substances, that, mainly, are, poisonous, to, a, common, pathogen, to, the, organism, and, humans, are, considered, antibiotics, bacteria, are, for, example, a, common, adversary, for, penicillium, chrysogenum, mold, and, humans, and, since, the, mold, s, poison, only, targets, bacteria, humans, use, it, for, getting, rid, of, it, in, their, bodies, human, antimicrobial, peptides, which, are, toxic, to, viruses, fungi, bacteria, and, cancerous, cells, are, considered, a, part, of, the, immune, system, in, nuclear, physics, a, poison, is, a, substance, that, obstructs, or, inhibits, a, nuclear, reaction, environmentally, hazardous, substances, are, not, necessarily, poisons, and, vice, versa, for, example, food, industry, wastewater, which, may, contain, potato, juice, or, milk, can, be, hazardous, to, the, ecosystems, of, streams, and, rivers, by, consuming, oxygen, and, causing, eutrophication, but, is, nonhazardous, to, humans, and, not, classified, as, a, poison, biologically, speaking, any, substance, if, given, in, large, enough, amounts, is, poisonous, and, can, cause, death, for, instance, several, kilograms, worth, of, water, would, constitute, a, lethal, dose, many, substances, used, as, medications, such, as, fentanyl, have, an, ld, 50, only, one, order, of, magnitude, greater, than, the, ed50, an, alternative, classification, distinguishes, between, lethal, substances, that, provide, a, therapeutic, value, and, those, that, do, not, poisoning, can, be, either, acute, or, chronic, and, caused, by, a, variety, of, natural, or, synthetic, substances, substances, that, destroy, tissue, but, do, not, absorb, such, as, lye, are, classified, as, corrosives, rather, than, poisons, acute, poisoning, is, exposure, to, a, poison, on, one, occasion, or, during, a, short, period, of, time, symptoms, develop, in, close, relation, to, the, exposure, absorption, of, a, poison, is, necessary, for, systemic, poisoning, furthermore, many, common, household, medications, are, not, labeled, with, skull, and, crossbones, although, they, can, cause, severe, illness, or, even, death, poisoning, can, be, caused, by, excessive, consumption, of, generally, safe, substances, as, in, the, case, of, water, intoxication, agents, that, act, on, the, nervous, system, can, paralyze, in, seconds, or, less, and, include, both, biologically, derived, neurotoxins, and, so, called, nerve, gases, which, may, be, synthesized, for, warfare, or, industry, inhaled, or, ingested, cyanide, used, as, a, method, of, execution, in, gas, chambers, or, as, a, suicide, method, almost, instantly, starves, the, body, of, energy, by, inhibiting, the, enzymes, in, mitochondria, that, make, atp, intravenous, injection, of, an, unnaturally, high, concentration, of, potassium, chloride, such, as, in, the, execution, of, prisoners, in, parts, of, the, united, states, quickly, stops, the, heart, by, eliminating, the, cell, potential, necessary, for, muscle, contraction, most, biocides, including, pesticides, are, created, to, act, as, acute, poisons, to, target, organisms, although, acute, or, less, observable, chronic, poisoning, can, also, occur, in, non, target, organisms, secondary, poisoning, including, the, humans, who, apply, the, biocides, and, other, beneficial, organisms, for, example, the, herbicide, 2, 4, d, imitates, the, action, of, a, plant, hormone, which, makes, its, lethal, toxicity, specific, to, plants, indeed, 2, 4, d, is, not, a, poison, but, classified, as, harmful, eu, many, substances, regarded, as, poisons, are, toxic, only, indirectly, by, toxication, an, example, is, wood, alcohol, or, methanol, which, is, not, poisonous, itself, but, is, chemically, converted, to, toxic, formaldehyde, and, formic, acid, in, the, liver, many, drug, molecules, are, made, toxic, in, the, liver, and, the, genetic, variability, of, certain, liver, enzymes, makes, the, toxicity, of, many, compounds, differ, between, individuals, exposure, to, radioactive, substances, can, produce, radiation, poisoning, an, unrelated, phenomenon, two, common, cases, of, acute, natural, poisoning, are, theobromine, poisoning, of, dogs, and, cats, and, mushroom, poisoning, in, humans, dogs, and, cats, are, not, natural, herbivores, but, a, chemical, defense, developed, by, theobroma, cacao, can, be, incidentally, fatal, nevertheless, many, omnivores, including, humans, readily, consume, edible, fungi, and, thus, many, fungi, have, evolved, to, become, decisively, inedible, in, this, case, as, a, direct, defense, chronic, poisoning, is, long, term, repeated, or, continuous, exposure, to, a, poison, where, symptoms, do, not, occur, immediately, or, after, each, exposure, the, person, gradually, becomes, ill, or, becomes, ill, after, a, long, latent, period, chronic, poisoning, most, commonly, occurs, following, exposure, to, poisons, that, bioaccumulate, or, are, biomagnified, such, as, mercury, gadolinium, and, lead, in, 2010, poisoning, resulted, in, about, 180, 000, deaths, down, from, 200, 000, in, 1990, there, were, approximately, 727, 500, emergency, department, visits, in, the, united, states, involving, poisonings, 3, 3, of, all, injury, related, encounters, poisonous, compounds, may, be, useful, either, for, their, toxicity, or, more, often, because, of, another, chemical, property, such, as, specific, chemical, reactivity, poisons, are, widely, used, in, industry, and, agriculture, as, chemical, reagents, solvents, or, complexing, reagents, e, g, carbon, monoxide, methanol, and, sodium, cyanide, respectively, they, are, less, common, in, household, use, with, occasional, exceptions, such, as, ammonia, and, methanol, for, instance, phosgene, is, a, highly, reactive, nucleophile, acceptor, which, makes, it, an, excellent, reagent, for, polymerizing, diols, and, diamines, to, produce, polycarbonate, and, polyurethane, plastics, for, this, use, millions, of, tons, are, produced, annually, however, the, same, reactivity, makes, it, also, highly, reactive, towards, proteins, in, human, tissue, and, thus, highly, toxic, in, fact, phosgene, has, been, used, as, a, chemical, weapon, it, can, be, contrasted, with, mustard, gas, which, has, only, been, produced, for, chemical, weapons, uses, as, it, has, no, particular, industrial, use, biocides, need, not, be, poisonous, to, humans, because, they, can, target, metabolic, pathways, absent, in, humans, leaving, only, incidental, toxicity, for, instance, the, herbicide, 2, 4, dichlorophenoxyacetic, acid, is, a, mimic, of, a, plant, growth, hormone, which, causes, uncontrollable, growth, leading, to, the, death, of, the, plant, humans, and, animals, lacking, this, hormone, and, its, receptor, are, unaffected, by, this, and, need, to, ingest, relatively, large, doses, before, any, toxicity, appears, human, toxicity, is, however, hard, to, avoid, with, pesticides, targeting, mammals, such, as, rodenticides, the, risk, from, toxicity, is, also, distinct, from, toxicity, itself, for, instance, the, preservative, thiomersal, used, in, vaccines, is, toxic, but, the, quantity, administered, in, a, single, shot, is, negligible, throughout, human, history, intentional, application, of, poison, has, been, used, as, a, method, of, murder, pest, control, suicide, and, execution, as, a, method, of, execution, poison, has, been, ingested, as, the, ancient, athenians, did, see, socrates, inhaled, as, with, carbon, monoxide, or, hydrogen, cyanide, see, gas, chamber, injected, see, lethal, injection, or, even, as, an, enema, poison, s, lethal, effect, can, be, combined, with, its, allegedly, magical, powers, an, example, is, the, chinese, gu, poison, poison, was, also, employed, in, gunpowder, warfare, for, example, the, 14th, century, chinese, text, of, the, huolongjing, written, by, jiao, yu, outlined, the, use, of, a, poisonous, gunpowder, mixture, to, fill, cast, iron, grenade, bombs, while, arsenic, is, a, naturally, occurring, environmental, poison, its, artificial, concentrate, was, once, nicknamed, inheritance, powder, in, medieval, europe, it, was, common, for, monarchs, to, employ, personal, food, tasters, to, thwart, royal, assassination, in, the, dawning, age, of, the, apothecary, the, term, poison, is, also, used, in, a, figurative, sense, the, slang, sense, of, alcoholic, drink, is, first, attested, 1805, american, english, e, g, a, bartender, might, ask, a, customer, what, s, your, poison, or, pick, your, poison, figurative, use, of, the, term, dates, from, the, late, 15th, century, figuratively, referring, to, persons, as, poison, dates, from, 1910, the, figurative, term, poison, pen, letter, became, well, known, in, 1913, by, a, notorious, criminal, case, in, pennsylvania, u, s, the, phrase, dates, to, 1898
