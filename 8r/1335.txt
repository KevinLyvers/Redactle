the, papanicolaou, test, abbreviated, as, pap, test, also, known, as, pap, smear, ae, cervical, smear, be, cervical, screening, be, or, smear, test, be, is, a, method, of, cervical, screening, used, to, detect, potentially, precancerous, and, cancerous, processes, in, the, cervix, opening, of, the, uterus, or, womb, or, more, rarely, anus, in, both, men, and, women, abnormal, findings, are, often, followed, up, by, more, sensitive, diagnostic, procedures, and, if, warranted, interventions, that, aim, to, prevent, progression, to, cervical, cancer, the, test, was, independently, invented, in, the, 1920s, by, the, greek, physician, georgios, papanikolaou, and, named, after, him, a, simplified, version, of, the, test, was, introduced, by, the, canadian, obstetrician, anna, marion, hilliard, in, 1957, a, pap, smear, is, performed, by, opening, the, vagina, with, a, speculum, and, collecting, cells, at, the, outer, opening, of, the, cervix, at, the, transformation, zone, where, the, outer, squamous, cervical, cells, meet, the, inner, glandular, endocervical, cells, using, an, ayre, spatula, or, a, cytobrush, the, collected, cells, are, examined, under, a, microscope, to, look, for, abnormalities, the, test, aims, to, detect, potentially, precancerous, changes, called, cervical, intraepithelial, neoplasia, cin, or, cervical, dysplasia, the, squamous, intraepithelial, lesion, system, sil, is, also, used, to, describe, abnormalities, caused, by, human, papillomavirus, a, sexually, transmitted, dna, virus, the, test, remains, an, effective, widely, used, method, for, early, detection, of, precancer, and, cervical, cancer, while, the, test, may, also, detect, infections, and, abnormalities, in, the, endocervix, and, endometrium, it, is, not, designed, to, do, so, guidelines, on, when, to, begin, pap, smear, screening, are, varied, but, usually, begin, in, adulthood, guidelines, on, frequency, vary, from, every, three, to, five, years, if, results, are, abnormal, and, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, abnormality, the, test, may, need, to, be, repeated, in, six, to, twelve, months, if, the, abnormality, requires, closer, scrutiny, the, patient, may, be, referred, for, detailed, inspection, of, the, cervix, by, colposcopy, which, magnifies, the, view, of, the, cervix, vagina, and, vulva, surfaces, the, person, may, also, be, referred, for, hpv, dna, testing, which, can, serve, as, an, adjunct, to, pap, testing, in, some, countries, viral, dna, is, checked, for, first, before, checking, for, abnormal, cells, additional, biomarkers, that, may, be, applied, as, ancillary, tests, with, the, pap, test, are, evolving, screening, guidelines, vary, from, country, to, country, in, general, screening, starts, about, the, age, of, 20, or, 25, and, continues, until, about, the, age, of, 50, or, 60, screening, is, typically, recommended, every, three, to, five, years, as, long, as, results, are, normal, american, congress, of, obstetricians, and, gynecologists, acog, and, others, recommend, starting, screening, at, age, 21, many, other, countries, wait, until, age, 25, or, later, to, start, screening, for, instance, some, parts, of, great, britain, start, screening, at, age, 25, acog, s, general, recommendation, is, that, people, with, female, reproductive, organs, age, 30, 65, have, an, annual, well, woman, examination, that, they, not, get, annual, pap, tests, and, that, they, do, get, pap, tests, at, three, to, five, year, intervals, hpv, is, passed, through, skin, to, skin, contact, sex, does, not, have, to, occur, although, it, is, a, common, way, for, it, to, spread, it, takes, an, average, of, a, year, but, can, take, up, to, four, years, for, a, person, s, immune, system, to, clear, the, initial, infection, screening, during, this, period, may, show, this, immune, reaction, and, repair, as, mild, abnormalities, which, are, usually, not, associated, with, cervical, cancer, but, could, cause, the, patient, stress, and, result, in, further, tests, and, possible, treatment, cervical, cancer, usually, takes, time, to, develop, so, delaying, the, start, of, screening, a, few, years, poses, little, risk, of, missing, a, potentially, precancerous, lesion, for, instance, screening, people, under, age, 25, does, not, decrease, cancer, rates, under, age, 30, hpv, can, be, transmitted, in, sex, between, females, so, those, who, have, only, had, sex, with, other, females, should, be, screened, although, they, are, at, somewhat, lower, risk, for, cervical, cancer, guidelines, on, frequency, of, screening, vary, typically, every, three, to, five, years, for, those, who, have, not, had, previous, abnormal, smears, some, older, recommendations, suggested, screening, as, frequently, as, every, one, to, two, years, however, there, is, little, evidence, to, support, such, frequent, screening, annual, screening, has, little, benefit, but, leads, to, greatly, increased, cost, and, many, unnecessary, procedures, and, treatments, it, has, been, acknowledged, since, before, 1980, that, most, people, can, be, screened, less, often, in, some, guidelines, frequency, depends, on, age, for, instance, in, great, britain, screening, is, recommended, every, three, years, for, women, under, 50, and, every, five, years, for, those, over, screening, should, stop, at, about, age, 65, unless, there, is, a, history, of, abnormal, test, result, or, disease, there, is, probably, no, benefit, in, screening, people, aged, 60, or, over, whose, previous, tests, have, been, negative, if, a, woman, s, last, three, pap, results, were, normal, she, can, discontinue, testing, at, age, 65, according, to, the, uspstf, acog, acs, and, ascp, england, s, nhs, says, 64, there, is, no, need, to, continue, screening, after, a, complete, hysterectomy, for, benign, disease, pap, smear, screening, is, still, recommended, for, those, who, have, been, vaccinated, against, hpv, since, the, vaccines, do, not, cover, all, hpv, types, that, can, cause, cervical, cancer, also, the, vaccine, does, not, protect, against, hpv, exposure, before, vaccination, those, with, a, history, of, endometrial, cancer, should, discontinue, routine, pap, tests, after, hysterectomy, further, tests, are, unlikely, to, detect, recurrence, of, cancer, but, do, bring, the, risk, of, giving, false, positive, results, which, would, lead, to, unnecessary, further, testing, more, frequent, pap, smears, may, be, needed, to, follow, up, after, an, abnormal, pap, smear, after, treatment, for, abnormal, pap, or, biopsy, results, or, after, treatment, of, cancer, cervical, anal, etc, the, pap, test, when, combined, with, a, regular, program, of, screening, and, appropriate, follow, up, can, reduce, cervical, cancer, deaths, by, up, to, 80, failure, of, prevention, of, cancer, by, the, pap, test, can, occur, for, many, reasons, including, not, getting, regular, screening, lack, of, appropriate, follow, up, of, abnormal, results, and, sampling, and, interpretation, errors, in, the, us, over, half, of, all, invasive, cancers, occur, in, females, who, have, never, had, a, pap, smear, an, additional, 10, to, 20, of, cancers, occur, in, those, who, have, not, had, a, pap, smear, in, the, preceding, five, years, about, one, quarter, of, us, cervical, cancers, were, in, people, who, had, an, abnormal, pap, smear, but, did, not, get, appropriate, follow, up, patient, did, not, return, for, care, or, clinician, did, not, perform, recommended, tests, or, treatment, adenocarcinoma, of, the, cervix, has, not, been, shown, to, be, prevented, by, pap, smears, in, the, uk, which, has, a, pap, smear, screening, program, adenocarcinoma, accounts, for, about, 15, of, all, cervical, cancers, estimates, of, the, effectiveness, of, the, united, kingdom, s, call, and, recall, system, vary, widely, but, it, may, prevent, about, 700, deaths, per, year, in, the, uk, multiple, studies, have, performed, sensitivity, and, specificity, analyses, on, pap, smears, sensitivity, analysis, captures, the, ability, of, pap, smears, to, correctly, identify, women, with, cervical, cancer, various, studies, have, revealed, the, sensitivity, of, pap, smears, to, be, between, 47, 19, 55, 5, specificity, analysis, captures, the, ability, of, pap, smears, to, correctly, identify, women, without, cervical, cancer, various, studies, have, revealed, the, specificity, of, pap, smears, to, be, between, 64, 79, 96, 8, while, pap, smears, may, not, be, entirely, accurate, they, remain, one, of, the, most, effective, cervical, cancer, prevention, tools, pap, smears, may, be, supplemented, with, hpv, dna, testing, in, screening, a, general, or, low, risk, population, most, pap, results, are, normal, in, the, united, states, about, 2, 3, million, abnormal, pap, smear, results, are, found, each, year, most, abnormal, results, are, mildly, abnormal, asc, us, typically, 2, 5, of, pap, results, or, low, grade, squamous, intraepithelial, lesion, lsil, about, 2, of, results, indicating, hpv, infection, although, most, low, grade, cervical, dysplasias, spontaneously, regress, without, ever, leading, to, cervical, cancer, dysplasia, can, serve, as, an, indication, that, increased, vigilance, is, needed, in, a, typical, scenario, about, 0, 5, of, pap, results, are, high, grade, sil, hsil, and, less, than, 0, 5, of, results, indicate, cancer, 0, 2, to, 0, 8, of, results, indicate, atypical, glandular, cells, of, undetermined, significance, agc, nos, as, liquid, based, preparations, lbps, become, a, common, medium, for, testing, atypical, result, rates, have, increased, the, median, rate, for, all, preparations, with, low, grade, squamous, intraepithelial, lesions, using, lbps, was, 2, 9, in, 2006, compared, with, a, 2003, median, rate, of, 2, 1, rates, for, high, grade, squamous, intraepithelial, lesions, median, 0, 5, and, atypical, squamous, cells, have, changed, little, abnormal, results, are, reported, according, to, the, bethesda, system, they, include, endocervical, and, endometrial, abnormalities, can, also, be, detected, as, can, a, number, of, infectious, processes, including, yeast, herpes, simplex, virus, and, trichomoniasis, however, it, is, not, very, sensitive, at, detecting, these, infections, so, absence, of, detection, on, a, pap, does, not, mean, absence, of, the, infection, pap, tests, can, usually, be, performed, during, pregnancy, up, to, at, least, 24, weeks, of, gestational, age, pap, tests, during, pregnancy, have, not, been, associated, with, increased, risk, of, miscarriage, an, inflammatory, component, is, commonly, seen, on, pap, smears, from, pregnant, women, and, does, not, appear, to, be, a, risk, for, subsequent, preterm, birth, after, childbirth, it, is, recommended, to, wait, 12, weeks, before, taking, a, pap, test, because, inflammation, of, the, cervix, caused, by, the, birth, interferes, with, test, interpretation, transgender, men, are, also, typically, at, risk, for, hpv, due, to, retention, of, the, uterine, cervix, in, the, majority, of, individuals, in, this, subgroup, as, such, professional, guidelines, recommend, that, transgender, men, be, screened, routinely, for, cervical, cancer, using, methods, such, as, pap, smear, identical, to, the, recommendations, for, cisgender, women, however, transgender, men, have, lower, rates, of, cervical, cancer, screening, than, cisgender, women, many, transgender, men, report, barriers, to, receiving, gender, affirming, healthcare, including, lack, of, insurance, coverage, and, stigma, discrimination, during, clinical, encounters, and, may, encounter, provider, misconceptions, regarding, risk, in, this, population, for, cervical, cancer, pap, smears, may, be, presented, to, patients, as, non, gendered, screening, procedures, for, cancer, rather, than, one, specific, for, examination, of, the, female, reproductive, organs, pap, smears, may, trigger, gender, dysphoria, in, patients, and, gender, neutral, language, can, be, used, when, explaining, the, pathogenesis, of, cancer, due, to, infection, emphasizing, the, pervasiveness, of, hpv, infection, regardless, of, gender, transgender, women, who, have, not, had, vaginoplasties, are, not, at, risk, of, developing, cervical, cancer, because, they, do, not, have, cervices, transgender, women, who, have, had, vaginoplasties, and, have, a, neo, cervix, or, neo, vagina, have, a, small, chance, of, developing, cancer, according, to, the, canadian, cancer, society, surgeons, typically, use, penile, skin, to, create, the, new, vagina, and, cervix, which, can, contract, hpv, and, lead, to, penile, cancer, although, it, is, considerably, rarer, than, cervical, cancer, because, the, risk, of, this, kind, of, cancer, is, so, low, cervical, cancer, screening, is, not, routinely, offered, for, those, with, a, neo, cervix, according, to, the, cdc, intercourse, douching, and, the, use, of, vaginal, medicines, or, spermicidal, foam, should, be, avoided, for, 2, days, before, the, test, a, number, of, studies, have, shown, that, using, a, small, amount, of, water, based, gel, lubricant, does, not, interfere, with, obscure, or, distort, the, pap, smear, further, cytology, is, not, affected, nor, are, some, std, testing, the, cdc, states, that, pap, smears, can, be, performed, during, menstruation, however, the, nhs, recommends, against, cervical, screening, during, or, in, the, 2, days, before, and, after, menstruation, pap, smears, can, be, performed, during, menstruation, especially, if, the, physician, is, using, a, liquid, based, test, however, if, bleeding, is, extremely, heavy, endometrial, cells, can, obscure, cervical, cells, and, if, this, occurs, the, test, may, need, to, be, repeated, in, 6, months, pap, smears, begin, with, the, insertion, of, a, speculum, into, the, vagina, which, spreads, the, vagina, open, and, allows, access, to, the, cervix, the, health, care, provider, then, collects, a, sample, of, cells, from, the, outer, opening, or, external, os, of, the, cervix, by, scraping, it, with, either, a, spatula, or, brush, obtaining, a, pap, smear, should, not, cause, much, pain, but, may, be, uncomfortable, conditions, such, as, vaginismus, vulvodynia, or, cervical, stenosis, can, cause, insertion, of, the, speculum, to, be, painful, in, a, conventional, pap, smear, the, cells, are, placed, on, a, glass, slide, and, taken, to, the, laboratory, to, be, checked, for, abnormalities, a, plastic, fronded, broom, is, sometimes, used, in, place, of, the, spatula, or, brush, the, broom, is, not, as, good, a, collection, device, since, it, is, much, less, effective, at, collecting, endocervical, material, than, the, spatula, and, brush, the, broom, is, used, more, frequently, with, the, advent, of, liquid, based, cytology, although, either, type, of, collection, device, may, be, used, with, either, type, of, cytology, the, sample, is, stained, using, the, papanicolaou, technique, in, which, tinctorial, dyes, and, acids, are, selectively, retained, by, cells, unstained, cells, cannot, be, seen, adequately, with, a, light, microscope, papanicolaou, chose, stains, that, highlighted, cytoplasmic, keratinization, which, actually, has, almost, nothing, to, do, with, the, nuclear, features, used, to, make, diagnoses, now, a, single, smear, has, an, area, of, 25, x, 50, mm, and, contains, a, few, hundred, thousand, cells, on, average, screening, with, light, microscopy, is, first, done, on, low, 10x, power, and, then, switched, to, higher, 40x, power, upon, viewing, suspicious, findings, cells, are, analyzed, under, high, power, for, morphologic, changes, indicative, of, malignancy, including, enlarged, and, irregularly, shaped, nucleus, an, increase, in, nucleus, to, cytoplasm, ratio, and, more, coarse, and, irregular, chromatin, approximately, 1, 000, fields, of, view, are, required, on, 10x, power, for, screening, of, a, single, sample, which, takes, on, average, 5, to, 10, minutes, in, some, cases, a, computer, system, may, prescreen, the, slides, indicating, those, that, do, not, need, examination, by, a, person, or, highlighting, areas, for, special, attention, the, sample, is, then, usually, screened, by, a, specially, trained, and, qualified, cytotechnologist, using, a, light, microscope, the, terminology, for, who, screens, the, sample, varies, according, to, the, country, in, the, uk, the, personnel, are, known, as, cytoscreeners, biomedical, scientists, bms, advanced, practitioners, and, pathologists, the, latter, two, take, responsibility, for, reporting, the, abnormal, sample, which, may, require, further, investigation, in, the, last, decade, there, have, been, successful, attempts, to, develop, automated, computer, image, analysis, systems, for, screening, although, on, the, available, evidence, automated, cervical, screening, could, not, be, recommended, for, implementation, into, a, national, screening, program, a, recent, nhs, health, technology, appraisal, concluded, that, the, general, case, for, automated, image, analysis, ha, d, probably, been, made, automation, may, improve, sensitivity, and, reduce, unsatisfactory, specimens, two, systems, have, been, approved, by, the, fda, and, function, in, high, volume, reference, laboratories, with, human, oversight, pap, tests, commonly, examine, epithelial, abnormalities, such, as, metaplasia, dysplasia, or, borderline, changes, all, of, which, may, be, indicative, of, cin, nuclei, will, stain, dark, blue, squamous, cells, will, stain, green, and, keratinised, cells, will, stain, pink, orange, koilocytes, may, be, observed, where, there, is, some, dyskaryosis, of, epithelium, the, nucleus, in, koilocytes, is, typically, irregular, indicating, possible, cause, for, concern, requiring, further, confirmatory, screens, and, tests, in, addition, human, papillomavirus, hpv, test, may, be, performed, either, as, indicated, for, abnormal, pap, results, or, in, some, cases, dual, testing, is, done, where, both, a, pap, smear, and, an, hpv, test, are, done, at, the, same, time, also, called, pap, co, testing, the, endocervix, may, be, partially, sampled, with, the, device, used, to, obtain, the, ectocervical, sample, but, due, to, the, anatomy, of, this, area, consistent, and, reliable, sampling, cannot, be, guaranteed, since, abnormal, endocervical, cells, may, be, sampled, those, examining, them, are, taught, to, recognize, them, the, endometrium, is, not, directly, sampled, with, the, device, used, to, sample, the, ectocervix, cells, may, exfoliate, onto, the, cervix, and, be, collected, from, there, so, as, with, endocervical, cells, abnormal, cells, can, be, recognised, if, present, but, the, pap, test, should, not, be, used, as, a, screening, tool, for, endometrial, malignancy, in, the, united, states, a, pap, test, itself, costs, 20, to, 30, but, the, costs, for, pap, test, visits, can, cost, over, 1, 000, largely, because, additional, tests, are, added, that, may, or, may, not, be, necessary, the, test, was, invented, by, and, named, after, the, greek, doctor, georgios, papanikolaou, who, started, his, research, in, 1923, aurel, babe, independently, made, similar, discoveries, in, 1927, however, babe, method, was, radically, different, from, papanikolaou, s, the, pap, test, was, finally, recognized, only, after, a, leading, article, in, the, american, journal, of, obstetrics, and, gynecology, in, 1941, by, papanikolaou, and, herbert, f, traut, an, american, gynecologist, a, monograph, titled, diagnosis, of, uterine, cancer, by, the, vaginal, smear, that, they, published, contained, drawings, of, the, various, cells, seen, in, patients, with, no, disease, inflammatory, conditions, and, preclinical, and, clinical, carcinoma, the, monograph, was, illustrated, by, hashime, murayama, who, later, became, a, staff, illustrator, with, the, national, geographic, society, both, papanikolaou, and, his, wife, andromachi, papanikolaou, dedicated, the, rest, of, their, lives, to, teaching, the, technique, to, other, physicians, and, laboratory, personnel, in, the, developed, world, cervical, biopsy, guided, by, colposcopy, is, considered, the, gold, standard, for, diagnosing, cervical, abnormalities, after, an, abnormal, pap, smear, other, techniques, such, as, triple, smear, are, also, done, after, an, abnormal, pap, smear, the, procedure, requires, a, trained, colposcopist, and, can, be, expensive, to, perform, however, pap, smears, are, very, sensitive, and, some, negative, biopsy, results, may, represent, undersampling, of, the, lesion, in, the, biopsy, so, negative, biopsy, with, positive, cytology, requires, careful, follow, up, experimental, visualization, techniques, use, broad, band, light, e, g, direct, visualization, speculoscopy, cervicography, visual, inspection, with, acetic, acid, or, with, lugol, s, and, colposcopy, and, electronic, detection, methods, e, g, polarprobe, and, in, vivo, spectroscopy, these, techniques, are, less, expensive, and, can, be, performed, with, significantly, less, training, they, do, not, perform, as, well, as, pap, smear, screening, and, colposcopy, at, this, point, these, techniques, have, not, been, validated, by, large, scale, trials, and, are, not, in, general, use, australia, has, used, the, pap, test, as, part, of, its, cervical, screening, program, since, its, implementation, in, 1991, which, required, women, past, the, age, of, 18, be, tested, every, two, years, in, december, 2017, australia, discontinued, its, use, of, the, pap, test, and, replaced, it, with, a, new, hpv, test, that, is, only, required, to, be, conducted, once, every, five, years, from, the, age, of, 25, medicare, covers, the, costs, of, testing, however, if, a, patient, s, doctor, does, not, allow, bulk, billing, they, may, have, to, pay, for, the, appointment, and, then, claim, the, medicare, rebate, free, pap, tests, were, offered, from, 1974, 1984, before, being, replaced, by, a, system, in, which, all, women, over, the, age, of, 30, could, have, the, cost, of, their, pap, test, reimbursed, by, the, national, health, insurance, in, 1995, this, policy, was, still, ongoing, in, 2018, and, encouraged, women, to, screen, at, least, every, three, years, despite, this, the, number, of, people, receiving, pap, tests, remain, lower, than, countries, like, australia, some, believe, this, is, due, to, a, lack, of, awareness, regarding, the, test, and, its, availability, it, has, also, been, found, that, women, who, have, chronic, diseases, or, other, reproductive, diseases, are, less, likely, to, receive, the, test, as, of, 2020, the, nhs, maintains, a, cervical, screening, program, in, which, women, between, the, age, of, 25, 49, are, invited, for, a, smear, test, every, three, years, and, women, past, 50, every, five, years, much, like, australia, england, uses, a, hpv, test, before, examining, cells, that, test, positive, using, the, pap, test, the, test, is, free, as, part, of, the, national, cervical, screening, program, the, finding, of, coccoid, bacteria, on, a, pap, test, is, of, no, consequence, with, otherwise, normal, test, findings, and, no, infectious, symptoms, however, if, there, is, enough, inflammation, to, obscure, the, detection, of, precancerous, and, cancerous, processes, it, may, indicate, treatment, with, a, broad, spectrum, antibiotic, for, streptococci, and, anaerobic, bacteria, such, as, metronidazole, and, amoxicillin, before, repeating, the, smear, alternatively, the, test, will, be, repeated, at, an, earlier, time, than, it, would, otherwise, if, there, are, symptoms, of, vaginal, discharge, bad, odor, or, irritation, the, presence, of, coccoid, bacteria, also, may, indicate, treatment, with, antibiotics, as, per, above
