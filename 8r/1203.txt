nutrition, is, the, biochemical, and, physiological, process, by, which, an, organism, uses, food, to, support, its, life, it, provides, organisms, with, nutrients, which, can, be, metabolized, to, create, energy, and, chemical, structures, failure, to, obtain, the, required, amount, of, nutrients, causes, malnutrition, nutritional, science, is, the, study, of, nutrition, though, it, typically, emphasizes, human, nutrition, the, type, of, organism, determines, what, nutrients, it, needs, and, how, it, obtains, them, organisms, obtain, nutrients, by, consuming, organic, matter, consuming, inorganic, matter, absorbing, light, or, some, combination, of, these, some, can, produce, nutrients, internally, by, consuming, basic, elements, while, some, must, consume, other, organisms, to, obtain, pre, existing, nutrients, all, forms, of, life, require, carbon, energy, and, water, as, well, as, various, other, molecules, animals, require, complex, nutrients, such, as, carbohydrates, lipids, and, proteins, obtaining, them, by, consuming, other, organisms, humans, have, developed, agriculture, and, cooking, to, replace, foraging, and, advance, human, nutrition, plants, acquire, nutrients, through, the, soil, and, the, atmosphere, fungi, absorb, nutrients, around, them, by, breaking, them, down, and, absorbing, them, through, the, mycelium, scientific, analysis, of, food, and, nutrients, began, during, the, chemical, revolution, in, the, late, 18th, century, chemists, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, experimented, with, different, elements, and, food, sources, to, develop, theories, of, nutrition, modern, nutrition, science, began, in, the, 1910s, as, individual, micronutrients, began, to, be, identified, the, first, vitamin, to, be, chemically, identified, was, thiamine, in, 1926, and, vitamin, c, was, identified, as, a, protection, against, scurvy, in, 1932, the, role, of, vitamins, in, nutrition, was, studied, in, the, following, decades, the, first, recommended, dietary, allowances, for, humans, were, developed, to, address, fears, of, disease, caused, by, food, deficiencies, during, the, great, depression, and, the, second, world, war, due, to, its, importance, in, human, health, the, study, of, nutrition, has, heavily, emphasized, human, nutrition, and, agriculture, while, ecology, is, a, secondary, concern, nutrients, are, substances, that, provide, energy, and, physical, components, to, the, organism, allowing, it, to, survive, grow, and, reproduce, nutrients, can, be, basic, elements, or, complex, macromolecules, approximately, 30, elements, are, found, in, organic, matter, with, nitrogen, carbon, and, phosphorus, being, the, most, important, macronutrients, are, the, primary, substances, required, by, an, organism, and, micronutrients, are, substances, required, by, an, organism, in, trace, amounts, organic, micronutrients, are, classified, as, vitamins, and, inorganic, micronutrients, are, classified, as, minerals, nutrients, are, absorbed, by, the, cells, and, used, in, metabolic, biochemical, reactions, these, include, fueling, reactions, that, create, precursor, metabolites, and, energy, biosynthetic, reactions, that, convert, precursor, metabolites, into, building, block, molecules, polymerizations, that, combine, these, molecules, into, macromolecule, polymers, and, assembly, reactions, that, use, these, polymers, to, construct, cellular, structures, organisms, can, be, classified, by, how, they, obtain, carbon, and, energy, heterotrophs, are, organisms, that, obtain, nutrients, by, consuming, the, carbon, of, other, organisms, while, autotrophs, are, organisms, that, produce, their, own, nutrients, from, the, carbon, of, inorganic, substances, like, carbon, dioxide, mixotrophs, are, organisms, that, can, be, heterotrophs, and, autotrophs, including, some, plankton, and, carnivorous, plants, phototrophs, obtain, energy, from, light, while, chemotrophs, obtain, energy, by, consuming, chemical, energy, from, matter, organotrophs, consume, other, organisms, to, obtain, electrons, while, lithotrophs, obtain, electrons, from, inorganic, substances, such, as, water, hydrogen, sulfide, dihydrogen, iron, ii, sulfur, or, ammonium, prototrophs, can, create, essential, nutrients, from, other, compounds, while, auxotrophs, must, consume, preexisting, nutrients, in, nutrition, the, diet, of, an, organism, is, the, sum, of, the, foods, it, eats, a, healthy, diet, improves, the, physical, and, mental, health, of, an, organism, this, requires, ingestion, and, absorption, of, vitamins, minerals, essential, amino, acids, from, protein, and, essential, fatty, acids, from, fat, containing, food, carbohydrates, protein, and, fat, play, major, roles, in, ensuring, the, quality, of, life, health, and, longevity, of, the, organism, some, cultures, and, religions, have, restrictions, on, what, is, acceptable, for, their, diet, a, nutrient, cycle, is, a, biogeochemical, cycle, involving, the, movement, of, inorganic, matter, through, a, combination, of, soil, organisms, air, or, water, where, they, are, exchanged, in, organic, matter, energy, flow, is, a, unidirectional, and, noncyclic, pathway, whereas, the, movement, of, mineral, nutrients, is, cyclic, mineral, cycles, include, the, carbon, cycle, sulfur, cycle, nitrogen, cycle, water, cycle, phosphorus, cycle, and, oxygen, cycle, among, others, that, continually, recycle, along, with, other, mineral, nutrients, into, productive, ecological, nutrition, biogeochemical, cycles, that, are, performed, by, living, organisms, and, natural, processes, are, water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, sulfur, cycles, nutrient, cycles, allow, these, essential, elements, to, return, to, the, environment, after, being, absorbed, or, consumed, without, proper, nutrient, cycling, there, would, be, risk, of, change, in, oxygen, levels, climate, and, ecosystem, function, foraging, is, the, process, of, seeking, out, nutrients, in, the, environment, it, may, also, be, defined, to, include, the, subsequent, use, of, the, resources, some, organisms, such, as, animals, and, bacteria, can, navigate, to, find, nutrients, while, others, such, as, plants, and, fungi, extend, outward, to, find, nutrients, foraging, may, be, random, in, which, the, organism, seeks, nutrients, without, method, or, it, may, be, systematic, in, which, the, organism, can, go, directly, to, a, food, source, organisms, are, able, to, detect, nutrients, through, taste, or, other, forms, of, nutrient, sensing, allowing, them, to, regulate, nutrient, intake, optimal, foraging, theory, is, a, model, that, explains, foraging, behavior, as, a, cost, benefit, analysis, in, which, an, animal, must, maximize, the, gain, of, nutrients, while, minimizing, the, amount, of, time, and, energy, spent, foraging, it, was, created, to, analyze, the, foraging, habits, of, animals, but, it, can, also, be, extended, to, other, organisms, some, organisms, are, specialists, that, are, adapted, to, forage, for, a, single, food, source, while, others, are, generalists, that, can, consume, a, variety, of, food, sources, nutrient, deficiencies, known, as, malnutrition, occur, when, an, organism, does, not, have, the, nutrients, that, it, needs, this, may, be, caused, by, suddenly, losing, nutrients, or, the, inability, to, absorb, proper, nutrients, not, only, is, malnutrition, the, result, of, a, lack, of, necessary, nutrients, but, it, can, also, be, a, result, of, other, illnesses, and, health, conditions, when, this, occurs, an, organism, will, adapt, by, reducing, energy, consumption, and, expenditure, to, prolong, the, use, of, stored, nutrients, it, will, use, stored, energy, reserves, until, they, are, depleted, and, it, will, then, break, down, its, own, body, mass, for, additional, energy, a, balanced, diet, includes, appropriate, amounts, of, all, essential, and, nonessential, nutrients, these, can, vary, by, age, weight, sex, physical, activity, levels, and, more, a, lack, of, just, one, essential, nutrient, can, cause, bodily, harm, just, as, an, overabundance, can, cause, toxicity, the, daily, reference, values, keep, the, majority, of, people, from, nutrient, deficiencies, drvs, are, not, recommendations, but, a, combination, of, nutrient, references, to, educate, professionals, and, policymakers, on, what, the, maximum, and, minimum, nutrient, intakes, are, for, the, average, person, food, labels, also, use, drvs, as, a, reference, to, create, safe, nutritional, guidelines, for, the, average, healthy, person, animals, are, heterotrophs, that, consume, other, organisms, to, obtain, nutrients, herbivores, are, animals, that, eat, plants, carnivores, are, animals, that, eat, other, animals, and, omnivores, are, animals, that, eat, both, plants, and, other, animals, many, herbivores, rely, on, bacterial, fermentation, to, create, digestible, nutrients, from, indigestible, plant, cellulose, while, obligate, carnivores, must, eat, animal, meats, to, obtain, certain, vitamins, or, nutrients, their, bodies, cannot, otherwise, synthesize, animals, generally, have, a, higher, requirement, of, energy, in, comparison, to, plants, the, macronutrients, essential, to, animal, life, are, carbohydrates, amino, acids, and, fatty, acids, all, macronutrients, except, water, are, required, by, the, body, for, energy, however, this, is, not, their, sole, physiological, function, the, energy, provided, by, macronutrients, in, food, is, measured, in, kilocalories, usually, called, calories, where, 1, calorie, is, the, amount, of, energy, required, to, raise, 1, kilogram, of, water, by, 1, degree, celsius, carbohydrates, are, molecules, that, store, significant, amounts, of, energy, animals, digest, and, metabolize, carbohydrates, to, obtain, this, energy, carbohydrates, are, typically, synthesized, by, plants, during, metabolism, and, animals, have, to, obtain, most, carbohydrates, from, nature, as, they, have, only, a, limited, ability, to, generate, them, they, include, sugars, oligosaccharides, and, polysaccharides, glucose, is, the, simplest, form, of, carbohydrate, carbohydrates, are, broken, down, to, produce, glucose, and, short, chain, fatty, acids, and, they, are, the, most, abundant, nutrients, for, herbivorous, land, animals, carbohydrates, contain, 4, calories, per, gram, lipids, provide, animals, with, fats, and, oils, they, are, not, soluble, in, water, and, they, can, store, energy, for, an, extended, period, of, time, they, can, be, obtained, from, many, different, plant, and, animal, sources, most, dietary, lipids, are, triglycerides, composed, of, glycerol, and, fatty, acids, phospholipids, and, sterols, are, found, in, smaller, amounts, an, animal, s, body, will, reduce, the, amount, of, fatty, acids, it, produces, as, dietary, fat, intake, increases, while, it, increases, the, amount, of, fatty, acids, it, produces, as, carbohydrate, intake, increases, fats, contain, 9, calories, per, gram, protein, consumed, by, animals, is, broken, down, to, amino, acids, which, would, be, later, used, to, synthesize, new, proteins, protein, is, used, to, form, cellular, structures, fluids, and, enzymes, biological, catalysts, enzymes, are, essential, to, most, metabolic, processes, as, well, as, dna, replication, repair, and, transcription, protein, contains, 4, calories, per, gram, much, of, animal, behavior, is, governed, by, nutrition, migration, patterns, and, seasonal, breeding, take, place, in, conjunction, with, food, availability, and, courtship, displays, are, used, to, display, an, animal, s, health, animals, develop, positive, and, negative, associations, with, foods, that, affect, their, health, and, they, can, instinctively, avoid, foods, that, have, caused, toxic, injury, or, nutritional, imbalances, through, a, conditioned, food, aversion, some, animals, such, as, rats, do, not, seek, out, new, types, of, foods, unless, they, have, a, nutrient, deficiency, early, human, nutrition, consisted, of, foraging, for, nutrients, like, other, animals, but, it, diverged, at, the, beginning, of, the, holocene, with, the, neolithic, revolution, in, which, humans, developed, agriculture, to, produce, food, the, chemical, revolution, in, the, 18th, century, allowed, humans, to, study, the, nutrients, in, foods, and, develop, more, advanced, methods, of, food, preparation, major, advances, in, economics, and, technology, during, the, 20th, century, allowed, mass, production, and, food, fortification, to, better, meet, the, nutritional, needs, of, humans, human, behavior, is, closely, related, to, human, nutrition, making, it, a, subject, of, social, science, in, addition, to, biology, nutrition, in, humans, is, balanced, with, eating, for, pleasure, and, optimal, diet, may, vary, depending, on, the, demographics, and, health, concerns, of, each, person, humans, are, omnivores, that, eat, a, variety, of, foods, cultivation, of, cereals, and, production, of, bread, has, made, up, a, key, component, of, human, nutrition, since, the, beginning, of, agriculture, early, humans, hunted, animals, for, meat, and, modern, humans, domesticate, animals, to, consume, their, meat, and, eggs, the, development, of, animal, husbandry, has, also, allowed, humans, in, some, cultures, to, consume, the, milk, of, other, animals, and, process, it, into, foods, such, as, cheese, other, foods, eaten, by, humans, include, nuts, seeds, fruits, and, vegetables, access, to, domesticated, animals, as, well, as, vegetable, oils, has, caused, a, significant, increase, in, human, intake, of, fats, and, oils, humans, have, developed, advanced, methods, of, food, processing, that, prevent, contamination, of, pathogenic, microorganisms, and, simplify, the, production, of, food, these, include, drying, freezing, heating, milling, pressing, packaging, refrigeration, and, irradiation, most, cultures, add, herbs, and, spices, to, foods, before, eating, to, add, flavor, though, most, do, not, significantly, affect, nutrition, other, additives, are, also, used, to, improve, the, safety, quality, flavor, and, nutritional, content, of, food, humans, obtain, most, carbohydrates, as, starch, from, cereals, though, sugar, has, grown, in, importance, lipids, can, be, found, in, animal, fat, butterfat, vegetable, oil, and, leaf, vegetables, and, they, are, also, used, to, increase, flavor, in, foods, protein, can, be, found, in, virtually, all, foods, as, it, makes, up, cellular, material, though, certain, methods, of, food, processing, may, reduce, the, amount, of, protein, in, a, food, humans, can, also, obtain, energy, from, ethanol, which, is, both, a, food, and, a, drug, but, it, provides, relatively, few, essential, nutrients, and, is, associated, with, nutritional, deficiencies, and, other, health, risks, in, humans, poor, nutrition, can, cause, deficiency, related, diseases, such, as, blindness, anemia, scurvy, preterm, birth, stillbirth, and, cretinism, or, nutrient, excess, conditions, such, as, obesity, and, metabolic, syndrome, other, conditions, possibly, affected, by, nutrition, disorders, include, cardiovascular, diseases, diabetes, and, osteoporosis, undernutrition, can, lead, to, wasting, in, acute, cases, and, stunting, of, marasmus, in, chronic, cases, of, malnutrition, in, domesticated, animals, such, as, pets, livestock, and, working, animals, as, well, as, other, animals, in, captivity, nutrition, is, managed, by, humans, through, animal, feed, fodder, and, forage, are, provided, to, livestock, specialized, pet, food, has, been, manufactured, since, 1860, and, subsequent, research, and, development, have, addressed, the, nutritional, needs, of, pets, dog, food, and, cat, food, in, particular, are, heavily, studied, and, typically, include, all, essential, nutrients, for, these, animals, cats, are, sensitive, to, some, common, nutrients, such, as, taurine, and, require, additional, nutrients, derived, from, meat, large, breed, puppies, are, susceptible, to, overnutrition, as, small, breed, dog, food, is, more, energy, dense, than, they, can, absorb, most, plants, obtain, nutrients, through, inorganic, substances, absorbed, from, the, soil, or, the, atmosphere, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and, sulfur, are, essential, nutrients, that, make, up, organic, material, in, a, plant, and, allow, enzymic, processes, these, are, absorbed, ions, in, the, soil, such, as, bicarbonate, nitrate, ammonium, and, sulfate, or, they, are, absorbed, as, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, water, oxygen, gas, and, sulfur, dioxide, phosphorus, boron, and, silicon, are, used, for, esterification, they, are, obtained, through, the, soil, as, phosphates, boric, acid, and, silicic, acid, respectively, other, nutrients, used, by, plants, are, potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, chlorine, iron, copper, zinc, and, molybdenum, plants, uptake, essential, elements, from, the, soil, through, their, roots, and, from, the, air, consisting, of, mainly, nitrogen, and, oxygen, through, their, leaves, nutrient, uptake, in, the, soil, is, achieved, by, cation, exchange, wherein, root, hairs, pump, hydrogen, ions, h, into, the, soil, through, proton, pumps, these, hydrogen, ions, displace, cations, attached, to, negatively, charged, soil, particles, so, that, the, cations, are, available, for, uptake, by, the, root, in, the, leaves, stomata, open, to, take, in, carbon, dioxide, and, expel, oxygen, although, nitrogen, is, plentiful, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, very, few, plants, can, use, this, directly, most, plants, therefore, require, nitrogen, compounds, to, be, present, in, the, soil, in, which, they, grow, this, is, made, possible, by, the, fact, that, largely, inert, atmospheric, nitrogen, is, changed, in, a, nitrogen, fixation, process, to, biologically, usable, forms, in, the, soil, by, bacteria, as, these, nutrients, do, not, provide, the, plant, with, energy, they, must, obtain, energy, by, other, means, green, plants, absorb, energy, from, sunlight, with, chloroplasts, and, convert, it, to, usable, energy, through, photosynthesis, fungi, are, chemoheterotrophs, that, consume, external, matter, for, energy, most, fungi, absorb, matter, through, the, root, like, mycelium, which, grows, through, the, organism, s, source, of, nutrients, and, can, extend, indefinitely, the, fungus, excretes, extracellular, enzymes, to, break, down, surrounding, matter, and, then, absorbs, the, nutrients, through, the, cell, wall, fungi, can, be, parasitic, saprophytic, or, symbiotic, parasitic, fungi, attach, and, feed, on, living, hosts, such, as, animals, plants, or, other, fungi, saprophytic, fungi, feed, on, dead, and, decomposing, organisms, symbiotic, fungi, grow, around, other, organisms, and, exchange, nutrients, with, them, protists, include, all, eukaryotes, that, are, not, animals, plants, or, fungi, resulting, in, great, diversity, between, them, algae, are, photosynthetic, protists, that, can, produce, energy, from, light, several, types, of, protists, use, mycelium, similar, to, those, of, fungi, protozoa, are, heterotrophic, protists, and, different, protozoa, seek, nutrients, in, different, ways, flagellate, protozoa, use, a, flagellum, to, assist, in, hunting, for, food, and, some, protozoa, travel, via, infectious, spores, to, act, as, parasites, many, protists, are, mixotrophic, having, both, phototrophic, and, heterotrophic, characteristics, mixotrophic, protists, will, typically, depend, on, one, source, of, nutrients, while, using, the, other, as, a, supplemental, source, or, a, temporary, alternative, when, its, primary, source, is, unavailable, prokaryotes, including, bacteria, and, archaea, vary, greatly, in, how, they, obtain, nutrients, across, nutritional, groups, prokaryotes, can, only, transport, soluble, compounds, across, their, cell, envelopes, but, they, can, break, down, chemical, components, around, them, some, lithotrophic, prokaryotes, are, extremophiles, that, can, survive, in, nutrient, deprived, environments, by, breaking, down, inorganic, matter, phototrophic, prokaryotes, such, as, cyanobacteria, and, chloroflexia, can, engage, in, photosynthesis, to, obtain, energy, from, sunlight, this, is, common, among, bacteria, that, form, in, mats, atop, geothermal, springs, phototrophic, prokaryotes, typically, obtain, carbon, from, assimilating, carbon, dioxide, through, the, calvin, cycle, some, prokaryotes, such, as, bdellovibrio, and, ensifer, are, predatory, and, feed, on, other, single, celled, organisms, predatory, prokaryotes, seek, out, other, organisms, through, chemotaxis, or, random, collision, merge, with, the, organism, degrade, it, and, absorb, the, released, nutrients, predatory, strategies, of, prokaryotes, include, attaching, to, the, outer, surface, of, the, organism, and, degrading, it, externally, entering, the, cytoplasm, of, the, organism, or, by, entering, the, periplasmic, space, of, the, organism, groups, of, predatory, prokaryotes, may, forgo, attachment, by, collectively, producing, hydrolytic, enzymes
