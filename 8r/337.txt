a, tetrapod, t, t, r, p, d, from, ancient, greek, tetra, four, and, po, s, foot, is, any, four, limbed, vertebrate, animal, of, the, superclass, tetrapoda, t, t, r, p, d, tetrapods, include, all, extant, and, extinct, amphibians, and, amniotes, with, the, latter, in, turn, evolving, into, two, major, clades, the, sauropsids, reptiles, including, dinosaurs, and, therefore, birds, and, synapsids, extinct, pelycosaurs, therapsids, and, all, extant, mammals, including, humans, some, tetrapods, such, as, snakes, legless, lizards, and, caecilians, have, evolved, to, become, limbless, via, mutations, of, the, hox, gene, nevertheless, these, limbless, groups, still, qualify, as, tetrapods, through, their, ancestry, and, some, retain, a, pair, of, vestigial, spurs, that, are, remnants, of, the, hindlimbs, tetrapods, evolved, from, a, group, of, primitive, semiaquatic, animals, known, as, the, tetrapodomorpha, which, in, turn, evolved, from, ancient, lobe, finned, fish, sarcopterygians, around, 390, million, years, ago, in, the, middle, devonian, period, tetrapodomorphs, were, transitional, between, lobe, finned, fishes, and, true, four, limbed, tetrapods, though, most, still, fit, the, body, plan, expected, of, other, lobe, finned, fishes, the, oldest, fossils, of, four, limbed, vertebrates, tetrapods, in, the, broad, sense, of, the, word, are, trackways, from, the, middle, devonian, and, body, fossils, became, common, near, the, end, of, the, late, devonian, around, 370, 360, million, years, ago, these, devonian, species, all, belonged, to, the, tetrapod, stem, group, meaning, that, they, were, not, directly, related, to, any, modern, tetrapod, group, broad, anatomical, descriptors, like, tetrapod, and, amphibian, can, approximate, some, members, of, the, stem, group, but, a, few, paleontologists, opt, for, more, specific, terms, such, as, stegocephali, limbs, evolved, prior, to, terrestrial, locomotion, but, by, the, start, of, the, carboniferous, period, 360, million, years, ago, a, few, stem, tetrapods, were, experimenting, with, a, semiaquatic, lifestyle, to, exploit, food, and, shelter, on, land, the, first, crown, tetrapods, those, descended, from, the, last, common, ancestors, of, extant, tetrapods, appeared, by, the, visean, age, of, the, early, carboniferous, the, specific, aquatic, ancestors, of, the, tetrapods, and, the, process, by, which, they, colonized, earth, s, land, after, emerging, from, water, remains, unclear, the, transition, from, a, body, plan, for, gill, based, aquatic, respiration, and, tail, propelled, aquatic, locomotion, to, one, that, enables, the, animal, to, survive, out, of, water, and, move, around, on, land, is, one, of, the, most, profound, evolutionary, changes, known, tetrapods, have, numerous, anatomical, and, physiological, features, that, are, distinct, from, their, aquatic, fish, ancestors, these, include, distinct, head, and, neck, structures, for, feeding, and, movements, appendicular, skeletons, shoulder, and, pelvic, girdles, in, particular, for, weight, bearing, and, locomotion, more, versatile, eyes, for, seeing, middle, ears, for, hearing, and, more, efficient, heart, and, lungs, for, oxygen, circulation, and, exchange, outside, water, stem, tetrapods, and, fish, a, pods, were, primarily, aquatic, modern, amphibians, which, evolved, from, earlier, groups, are, generally, semiaquatic, the, first, stages, of, their, lives, are, as, waterborne, eggs, and, fish, like, larvae, known, as, tadpoles, and, later, undergo, metamorphosis, to, grow, limbs, and, become, partly, terrestrial, and, partly, aquatic, however, most, tetrapod, species, today, are, amniotes, most, of, which, are, terrestrial, tetrapods, whose, branch, evolved, from, earlier, tetrapods, early, in, the, late, carboniferous, the, key, innovation, in, amniotes, over, amphibians, is, the, amnion, which, enables, the, eggs, to, retain, their, aqueous, contents, on, land, rather, than, needing, to, stay, in, water, some, amniotes, later, evolved, internal, fertilization, although, many, aquatic, species, outside, the, tetrapod, tree, had, evolved, such, before, the, tetrapods, appeared, e, g, materpiscis, some, tetrapods, such, as, snakes, and, caecilians, have, lost, some, or, all, of, their, limbs, through, further, speciation, and, evolution, some, have, only, concealed, vestigial, bones, as, a, remnant, of, the, limbs, of, their, distant, ancestors, others, returned, to, being, amphibious, or, otherwise, living, partially, or, fully, aquatic, lives, the, first, during, the, carboniferous, period, others, as, recently, as, the, cenozoic, one, fundamental, subgroup, of, amniotes, the, sauropsids, diverged, into, the, reptiles, lepidosaurs, lizards, snakes, and, the, tuatara, archosaurs, crocodilians, and, dinosaurs, of, which, birds, are, a, subset, turtles, and, various, other, extinct, forms, the, remaining, group, of, amniotes, the, synapsids, include, mammals, and, their, extinct, relatives, amniotes, include, the, only, tetrapods, that, further, evolved, for, flight, such, as, birds, from, among, the, dinosaurs, the, extinct, pterosaurs, from, earlier, archosaurs, and, bats, from, among, the, mammals, the, precise, definition, of, tetrapod, is, a, subject, of, strong, debate, among, paleontologists, who, work, with, the, earliest, members, of, the, group, a, majority, of, paleontologists, use, the, term, tetrapod, to, refer, to, all, vertebrates, with, four, limbs, and, distinct, digits, fingers, and, toes, as, well, as, legless, vertebrates, with, limbed, ancestors, limbs, and, digits, are, major, apomorphies, newly, evolved, traits, which, define, tetrapods, though, they, are, far, from, the, only, skeletal, or, biological, innovations, inherent, to, the, group, the, first, vertebrates, with, limbs, and, digits, evolved, in, the, devonian, including, the, late, devonian, age, ichthyostega, and, acanthostega, as, well, as, the, trackmakers, of, the, middle, devonian, age, zachelmie, trackways, defining, tetrapods, based, on, one, or, two, apomorphies, can, present, a, problem, if, these, apomorphies, were, acquired, by, more, than, one, lineage, through, convergent, evolution, to, resolve, this, potential, concern, the, apomorphy, based, definition, is, often, supported, by, an, equivalent, cladistic, definition, cladistics, is, a, modern, branch, of, taxonomy, which, classifies, organisms, through, evolutionary, relationships, as, reconstructed, by, phylogenetic, analyses, a, cladistic, definition, would, define, a, group, based, on, how, closely, related, its, constituents, are, tetrapoda, is, widely, considered, a, monophyletic, clade, a, group, with, all, of, its, component, taxa, sharing, a, single, common, ancestor, in, this, sense, tetrapoda, can, also, be, defined, as, the, clade, of, limbed, vertebrates, including, all, vertebrates, descended, from, the, first, limbed, vertebrates, a, portion, of, tetrapod, workers, led, by, french, paleontologist, michel, laurin, prefer, to, restrict, the, definition, of, tetrapod, to, the, crown, group, a, crown, group, is, a, subset, of, a, category, of, animal, defined, by, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, living, representatives, this, cladistic, approach, defines, tetrapods, as, the, nearest, common, ancestor, of, all, living, amphibians, the, lissamphibians, and, all, living, amniotes, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, along, with, all, of, the, descendants, of, that, ancestor, in, effect, tetrapod, is, a, name, reserved, solely, for, animals, which, lie, among, living, tetrapods, so, called, crown, tetrapods, this, is, a, node, based, clade, a, group, with, a, common, ancestry, descended, from, a, single, node, the, node, being, the, nearest, common, ancestor, of, living, species, defining, tetrapods, based, on, the, crown, group, would, exclude, many, four, limbed, vertebrates, which, would, otherwise, be, defined, as, tetrapods, devonian, tetrapods, such, as, ichthyostega, and, acanthostega, certainly, evolved, prior, to, the, split, between, lissamphibians, and, amniotes, and, thus, lie, outside, the, crown, group, they, would, instead, lie, along, the, stem, group, a, subset, of, animals, related, to, but, not, within, the, crown, group, the, stem, and, crown, group, together, are, combined, into, the, total, group, given, the, name, tetrapodomorpha, which, refers, to, all, animals, closer, to, living, tetrapods, than, to, dipnoi, lungfishes, the, next, closest, group, of, living, animals, many, early, tetrapodomorphs, are, clearly, fish, in, ecology, and, anatomy, but, later, tetrapodomorphs, are, much, more, similar, to, tetrapods, in, many, regards, such, as, the, presence, of, limbs, and, digits, laurin, s, approach, to, the, definition, of, tetrapods, is, rooted, in, the, belief, that, the, term, has, more, relevance, for, neontologists, zoologists, specializing, in, living, animals, than, paleontologists, who, primarily, use, the, apomorphy, based, definition, in, 1998, he, re, established, the, defunct, historical, term, stegocephali, to, replace, the, apomorphy, based, definition, of, tetrapod, used, by, many, authors, other, paleontologists, use, the, term, stem, tetrapod, to, refer, to, those, tetrapod, like, vertebrates, that, are, not, members, of, the, crown, group, including, both, early, limbed, tetrapods, and, tetrapodomorph, fishes, the, term, fishapod, was, popularized, after, the, discovery, and, 2006, publication, of, tiktaalik, an, advanced, tetrapodomorph, fish, which, was, closely, related, to, limbed, vertebrates, and, showed, many, apparently, transitional, traits, the, two, subclades, of, crown, tetrapods, are, batrachomorpha, and, reptiliomorpha, batrachomorphs, are, all, animals, sharing, a, more, recent, common, ancestry, with, living, amphibians, than, with, living, amniotes, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, reptiliomorphs, are, all, animals, sharing, a, more, recent, common, ancestry, with, living, amniotes, than, with, living, amphibians, gaffney, 1979, provided, the, name, neotetrapoda, to, the, crown, group, of, tetrapods, though, few, subsequent, authors, followed, this, proposal, tetrapoda, includes, three, living, classes, amphibians, reptiles, and, mammals, overall, the, biodiversity, of, lissamphibians, as, well, as, of, tetrapods, generally, has, grown, exponentially, over, time, the, more, than, 30, 000, species, living, today, are, descended, from, a, single, amphibian, group, in, the, early, to, middle, devonian, however, that, diversification, process, was, interrupted, at, least, a, few, times, by, major, biological, crises, such, as, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, which, at, least, affected, amniotes, the, overall, composition, of, biodiversity, was, driven, primarily, by, amphibians, in, the, palaeozoic, dominated, by, reptiles, in, the, mesozoic, and, expanded, by, the, explosive, growth, of, birds, and, mammals, in, the, cenozoic, as, biodiversity, has, grown, so, has, the, number, of, species, and, the, number, of, niches, that, tetrapods, have, occupied, the, first, tetrapods, were, aquatic, and, fed, primarily, on, fish, today, the, earth, supports, a, great, diversity, of, tetrapods, that, live, in, many, habitats, and, subsist, on, a, variety, of, diets, the, following, table, shows, summary, estimates, for, each, tetrapod, class, from, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, 2014, 3, for, the, number, of, extant, species, that, have, been, described, in, the, literature, as, well, as, the, number, of, threatened, species, the, classification, of, tetrapods, has, a, long, history, traditionally, tetrapods, are, divided, into, four, classes, based, on, gross, anatomical, and, physiological, traits, snakes, and, other, legless, reptiles, are, considered, tetrapods, because, they, are, sufficiently, like, other, reptiles, that, have, a, full, complement, of, limbs, similar, considerations, apply, to, caecilians, and, aquatic, mammals, newer, taxonomy, is, frequently, based, on, cladistics, instead, giving, a, variable, number, of, major, branches, clades, of, the, tetrapod, family, tree, as, is, the, case, throughout, evolutionary, biology, today, there, is, debate, over, how, to, properly, classify, the, groups, within, tetrapoda, traditional, biological, classification, sometimes, fails, to, recognize, evolutionary, transitions, between, older, groups, and, descendant, groups, with, markedly, different, characteristics, for, example, the, birds, which, evolved, from, the, dinosaurs, are, defined, as, a, separate, group, from, them, because, they, represent, a, distinct, new, type, of, physical, form, and, functionality, in, phylogenetic, nomenclature, in, contrast, the, newer, group, is, always, included, in, the, old, for, this, school, of, taxonomy, dinosaurs, and, birds, are, not, groups, in, contrast, to, each, other, but, rather, birds, are, a, sub, type, of, dinosaurs, the, tetrapods, including, all, large, and, medium, sized, land, animals, have, been, among, the, best, understood, animals, since, earliest, times, by, aristotle, s, time, the, basic, division, between, mammals, birds, and, egg, laying, tetrapods, the, herptiles, was, well, known, and, the, inclusion, of, the, legless, snakes, into, this, group, was, likewise, recognized, with, the, birth, of, modern, biological, classification, in, the, 18th, century, linnaeus, used, the, same, division, with, the, tetrapods, occupying, the, first, three, of, his, six, classes, of, animals, while, reptiles, and, amphibians, can, be, quite, similar, externally, the, french, zoologist, pierre, andr, latreille, recognized, the, large, physiological, differences, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, and, split, the, herptiles, into, two, classes, giving, the, four, familiar, classes, of, tetrapods, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, with, the, basic, classification, of, tetrapods, settled, a, half, a, century, followed, where, the, classification, of, living, and, fossil, groups, was, predominantly, done, by, experts, working, within, classes, in, the, early, 1930s, american, vertebrate, palaeontologist, alfred, romer, 1894, 1973, produced, an, overview, drawing, together, taxonomic, work, from, the, various, subfields, to, create, an, orderly, taxonomy, in, his, vertebrate, paleontology, this, classical, scheme, with, minor, variations, is, still, used, in, works, where, systematic, overview, is, essential, e, g, benton, 1998, and, knobill, and, neill, 2006, while, mostly, seen, in, general, works, it, is, also, still, used, in, some, specialist, works, like, fortuny, et, al, 2011, the, taxonomy, down, to, subclass, level, shown, here, is, from, hildebrand, and, goslow, 2001, this, classification, is, the, one, most, commonly, encountered, in, school, textbooks, and, popular, works, while, orderly, and, easy, to, use, it, has, come, under, critique, from, cladistics, the, earliest, tetrapods, are, grouped, under, class, amphibia, although, several, of, the, groups, are, more, closely, related, to, amniotes, than, to, modern, day, amphibians, traditionally, birds, are, not, considered, a, type, of, reptile, but, crocodiles, are, more, closely, related, to, birds, than, they, are, to, other, reptiles, such, as, lizards, birds, themselves, are, thought, to, be, descendants, of, theropod, dinosaurs, basal, non, mammalian, synapsids, mammal, like, reptiles, traditionally, also, sort, under, class, reptilia, as, a, separate, subclass, but, they, are, more, closely, related, to, mammals, than, to, living, reptiles, considerations, like, these, have, led, some, authors, to, argue, for, a, new, classification, based, purely, on, phylogeny, disregarding, the, anatomy, and, physiology, tetrapods, evolved, from, early, bony, fishes, osteichthyes, specifically, from, the, tetrapodomorph, branch, of, lobe, finned, fishes, sarcopterygii, living, in, the, early, to, middle, devonian, period, the, first, tetrapods, probably, evolved, in, the, emsian, stage, of, the, early, devonian, from, tetrapodomorph, fish, living, in, shallow, water, environments, the, very, earliest, tetrapods, would, have, been, animals, similar, to, acanthostega, with, legs, and, lungs, as, well, as, gills, but, still, primarily, aquatic, and, unsuited, to, life, on, land, the, earliest, tetrapods, inhabited, saltwater, brackish, water, and, freshwater, environments, as, well, as, environments, of, highly, variable, salinity, these, traits, were, shared, with, many, early, lobed, finned, fishes, as, early, tetrapods, are, found, on, two, devonian, continents, laurussia, euramerica, and, gondwana, as, well, as, the, island, of, north, china, it, is, widely, supposed, that, early, tetrapods, were, capable, of, swimming, across, the, shallow, and, relatively, narrow, continental, shelf, seas, that, separated, these, landmasses, since, the, early, 20th, century, several, families, of, tetrapodomorph, fishes, have, been, proposed, as, the, nearest, relatives, of, tetrapods, among, them, the, rhizodonts, notably, sauripterus, the, osteolepidids, the, tristichopterids, notably, eusthenopteron, and, more, recently, the, elpistostegalians, also, known, as, panderichthyida, notably, the, genus, tiktaalik, a, notable, feature, of, tiktaalik, is, the, absence, of, bones, covering, the, gills, these, bones, would, otherwise, connect, the, shoulder, girdle, with, skull, making, the, shoulder, girdle, part, of, the, skull, with, the, loss, of, the, gill, covering, bones, the, shoulder, girdle, is, separated, from, the, skull, connected, to, the, torso, by, muscle, and, other, soft, tissue, connections, the, result, is, the, appearance, of, the, neck, this, feature, appears, only, in, tetrapods, and, tiktaalik, not, other, tetrapodomorph, fishes, tiktaalik, also, had, a, pattern, of, bones, in, the, skull, roof, upper, half, of, the, skull, that, is, similar, to, the, end, devonian, tetrapod, ichthyostega, the, two, also, shared, a, semi, rigid, ribcage, of, overlapping, ribs, which, may, have, substituted, for, a, rigid, spine, in, conjunction, with, robust, forelimbs, and, shoulder, girdle, both, tiktaalik, and, ichthyostega, may, have, had, the, ability, to, locomote, on, land, in, the, manner, of, a, seal, with, the, forward, portion, of, the, torso, elevated, the, hind, part, dragging, behind, finally, tiktaalik, fin, bones, are, somewhat, similar, to, the, limb, bones, of, tetrapods, however, there, are, issues, with, positing, tiktaalik, as, a, tetrapod, ancestor, for, example, it, had, a, long, spine, with, far, more, vertebrae, than, any, known, tetrapod, or, other, tetrapodomorph, fish, also, the, oldest, tetrapod, trace, fossils, tracks, and, trackways, predate, it, by, a, considerable, margin, several, hypotheses, have, been, proposed, to, explain, this, date, discrepancy, 1, the, nearest, common, ancestor, of, tetrapods, and, tiktaalik, dates, to, the, early, devonian, by, this, hypothesis, the, lineage, is, the, closest, to, tetrapods, but, tiktaalik, itself, was, a, late, surviving, relic, 2, tiktaalik, represents, a, case, of, parallel, evolution, 3, tetrapods, evolved, more, than, once, coelacanthiformes, coelacanths, dipnoi, lungfish, tetrapodomorph, fishes, tetrapoda, the, oldest, evidence, for, the, existence, of, tetrapods, comes, from, trace, fossils, tracks, footprints, and, trackways, found, in, zache, mie, poland, dated, to, the, eifelian, stage, of, the, middle, devonian, 390, million, years, ago, although, these, traces, have, also, been, interpreted, as, the, ichnogenus, piscichnus, fish, nests, feeding, traces, the, adult, tetrapods, had, an, estimated, length, of, 2, 5, m, 8, feet, and, lived, in, a, lagoon, with, an, average, depth, of, 1, 2, m, although, it, is, not, known, at, what, depth, the, underwater, tracks, were, made, the, lagoon, was, inhabited, by, a, variety, of, marine, organisms, and, was, apparently, salt, water, the, average, water, temperature, was, 30, degrees, c, 86, f, the, second, oldest, evidence, for, tetrapods, also, tracks, and, trackways, date, from, ca, 385, mya, valentia, island, ireland, the, oldest, partial, fossils, of, tetrapods, date, from, the, frasnian, beginning, 380, mya, these, include, elginerpeton, and, obruchevichthys, some, paleontologists, dispute, their, status, as, true, digit, bearing, tetrapods, all, known, forms, of, frasnian, tetrapods, became, extinct, in, the, late, devonian, extinction, also, known, as, the, end, frasnian, extinction, this, marked, the, beginning, of, a, gap, in, the, tetrapod, fossil, record, known, as, the, famennian, gap, occupying, roughly, the, first, half, of, the, famennian, stage, the, oldest, near, complete, tetrapod, fossils, acanthostega, and, ichthyostega, date, from, the, second, half, of, the, fammennian, although, both, were, essentially, four, footed, fish, ichthyostega, is, the, earliest, known, tetrapod, that, may, have, had, the, ability, to, pull, itself, onto, land, and, drag, itself, forward, with, its, forelimbs, there, is, no, evidence, that, it, did, so, only, that, it, may, have, been, anatomically, capable, of, doing, so, the, publication, in, 2018, of, tutusius, umlambo, and, umzantsia, amazana, from, high, latitude, gondwana, setting, indicate, that, the, tetrapods, enjoyed, a, global, distribution, by, the, end, of, the, devonian, and, even, extend, into, the, high, latitudes, the, end, fammenian, marked, another, extinction, known, as, the, end, fammenian, extinction, or, the, hangenberg, event, which, is, followed, by, another, gap, in, the, tetrapod, fossil, record, romer, s, gap, also, known, as, the, tournaisian, gap, this, gap, which, was, initially, 30, million, years, but, has, been, gradually, reduced, over, time, currently, occupies, much, of, the, 13, 9, million, year, tournaisian, the, first, stage, of, the, carboniferous, period, tetrapod, like, vertebrates, first, appeared, in, the, early, devonian, period, and, species, with, limbs, and, digits, were, around, by, the, late, devonian, these, early, stem, tetrapods, included, animals, such, as, ichthyostega, with, legs, and, lungs, as, well, as, gills, but, still, primarily, aquatic, and, poorly, adapted, for, life, on, land, the, devonian, stem, tetrapods, went, through, two, major, population, bottlenecks, during, the, late, devonian, extinctions, also, known, as, the, end, frasnian, and, end, fammenian, extinctions, these, extinction, events, led, to, the, disappearance, of, stem, tetrapods, with, fish, like, features, when, stem, tetrapods, reappear, in, the, fossil, record, in, early, carboniferous, deposits, some, 10, million, years, later, the, adult, forms, of, some, are, somewhat, adapted, to, a, terrestrial, existence, why, they, went, to, land, in, the, first, place, is, still, debated, during, the, early, carboniferous, the, number, of, digits, on, hands, and, feet, of, stem, tetrapods, became, standardized, at, no, more, than, five, as, lineages, with, more, digits, died, out, exceptions, within, crown, group, tetrapods, arose, among, some, secondarily, aquatic, members, by, mid, carboniferous, times, the, stem, tetrapods, had, radiated, into, two, branches, of, true, crown, group, tetrapods, one, ancestral, to, modern, amphibians, and, the, other, ancestral, to, amniotes, modern, amphibians, are, most, likely, derived, from, the, temnospondyls, a, particularly, diverse, and, long, lasting, group, of, tetrapods, a, less, popular, proposal, draws, comparisons, to, the, lepospondyls, an, eclectic, mixture, of, various, small, tetrapods, including, burrowing, limbless, and, other, bizarrely, shaped, forms, the, reptiliomorphs, sometimes, known, as, anthracosaurs, were, the, relatives, and, ancestors, of, the, amniotes, reptiles, mammals, and, kin, the, first, amniotes, are, known, from, the, early, part, of, the, late, carboniferous, all, basal, amniotes, had, a, small, body, size, like, many, of, their, contemporaries, though, some, carboniferous, tetrapods, evolved, into, large, crocodile, like, predators, informally, known, as, labyrinthodonts, amphibians, must, return, to, water, to, lay, eggs, in, contrast, amniote, eggs, have, a, membrane, ensuring, gas, exchange, out, of, water, and, can, therefore, be, laid, on, land, amphibians, and, amniotes, were, affected, by, the, carboniferous, rainforest, collapse, crc, an, extinction, event, that, occurred, around, 307, million, years, ago, the, sudden, collapse, of, a, vital, ecosystem, shifted, the, diversity, and, abundance, of, major, groups, amniotes, and, temnospondyls, in, particular, were, more, suited, to, the, new, conditions, they, invaded, new, ecological, niches, and, began, diversifying, their, diets, to, include, plants, and, other, tetrapods, previously, having, been, limited, to, insects, and, fish, in, the, permian, period, amniotes, became, particularly, well, established, and, two, important, clades, filled, in, most, terrestrial, niches, the, sauropsids, and, the, synapsids, the, latter, were, the, most, important, and, successful, permian, land, animals, establishing, complex, terrestrial, ecosystems, of, predators, and, prey, while, acquiring, various, adaptations, retained, by, their, modern, descendants, the, mammals, sauropsid, diversity, was, more, subdued, during, the, permian, but, they, did, begin, to, fracture, into, several, lineages, ancestral, to, modern, reptiles, amniotes, were, not, the, only, tetrapods, to, experiment, with, prolonged, life, on, land, some, temnospondyls, seymouriamorphs, and, diadectomorphs, also, successfully, filled, terrestrial, niches, in, the, earlier, part, of, the, permian, non, amniote, tetrapods, declined, in, the, later, part, of, the, permian, the, end, of, the, permian, saw, a, major, turnover, in, fauna, during, the,

would, make, temnospondyls, tetrapods, in, the, lepospondyl, hypothesis, lh, lissamphibians, are, the, sister, taxon, of, lysorophian, lepospondyls, making, lepospondyls, tetrapods, and, temnospondyls, stem, tetrapods, in, the, polyphyletic, hypothesis, ph, frogs, and, salamanders, evolved, from, dissorophoid, temnospondyls, while, caecilians, come, out, of, microsaur, lepospondyls,

temnospondyls, usually, with, the, focus, on, amphibamids, and, branchiosaurids, the, temnospondyl, hypothesis, is, the, currently, favored, or, majority, view, supported, by, ruta, et, al, 2003a, b,

and, a, large, fleshy, fin, built, on, bones, that, could, give, rise, to, the, tetrapod, limb, to, propagate, in, the, terrestrial, environment, animals, had, to, overcome, certain, challenges, their, bodies, needed, additional, support, because, buoyancy, was, no, longer, a, factor, water, retention, was, now, important, since, it, was, no, longer, the, living, matrix, and, could, be, lost, easily, to, the, environment, finally, animals, needed, new, sensory, input, systems, to, have, any, ability, to, function, reasonably, on, land, the, brain, only, filled, half, of, the, skull, in, the, early, tetrapods, the, rest, was, filled, with, fatty, tissue, or, fluid, which, gave, the, brain, space, for, growth, as, they, adapted, to, a, life, on, land, the, palatal, and, jaw, structures, of, tetramorphs, were, similar, to, those, of, early, tetrapods, and, their, dentition, was, similar, too, with, labyrinthine, teeth, fitting, in, a, pit, and, tooth, arrangement, on, the, palate, a, major, difference, between, early, tetrapodomorph, fishes, and, early, tetrapods, was, in, the, relative, development, of, the, front, and, back, skull, portions, the, snout, is, much, less, developed, than, in, most, early, tetrapods, and, the, post, orbital, skull, is, exceptionally, longer, than, an, amphibian, s, a, notable, characteristic, that, make, a, tetrapod, s, skull, different, from, a, fish, s, are, the, relative, frontal, and, rear, portion, lengths, the, fish, had, a, long, rear, portion, while, the, front, was, short, the, orbital, vacuities, were, thus, located, towards, the, anterior, end, in, the, tetrapod, the, front, of, the, skull, lengthened, positioning, the, orbits, farther, back, on, the, skull, in, tetrapodomorph, fishes, such, as, eusthenopteron, the, part, of, the, body, that, would, later, become, the, neck, was, covered, by, a, number, of, gill, covering, bones, known, as, the, opercular, series, these, bones, functioned, as, part, of, pump, mechanism, for, forcing, water, through, the, mouth, and, past, the, gills, when, the, mouth, opened, to, take, in, water, the, gill, flaps, closed, including, the, gill, covering, bones, thus, ensuring, that, water, entered, only, through, the, mouth, when, the, mouth, closed, the, gill, flaps, opened, and, water, was, forced, through, the, gills, in, acanthostega, a, basal, tetrapod, the, gill, covering, bones, have, disappeared, although, the, underlying, gill, arches, are, still, present, besides, the, opercular, series, acanthostega, also, lost, the, throat, covering, bones, gular, series, the, opercular, series, and, gular, series, combined, are, sometimes, known, as, the, operculo, gular, or, operculogular, series, other, bones, in, the, neck, region, lost, in, acanthostega, and, later, tetrapods, include, the, extrascapular, series, and, the, supracleithral, series, both, sets, of, bones, connect, the, shoulder, girdle, to, the, skull, with, the, loss, of, these, bones, tetrapods, acquired, a, neck, allowing, the, head, to, rotate, somewhat, independently, of, the, torso, this, in, turn, required, stronger, soft, tissue, connections, between, head, and, torso, including, muscles, and, ligaments, connecting, the, skull, with, the, spine, and, shoulder, girdle, bones, and, groups, of, bones, were, also, consolidated, and, strengthened, in, carboniferous, tetrapods, the, neck, joint, occiput, provided, a, pivot, point, for, the, spine, against, the, back, of, the, skull, in, tetrapodomorph, fishes, such, as, eusthenopteron, no, such, neck, joint, existed, instead, the, notochord, a, rod, made, of, proto, cartilage, entered, a, hole, in, the, back, of, the, braincase, and, continued, to, the, middle, of, the, braincase, acanthostega, had, the, same, arrangement, as, eusthenopteron, and, thus, no, neck, joint, the, neck, joint, evolved, independently, in, different, lineages, of, early, tetrapods, all, tetrapods, appear, to, hold, their, necks, at, the, maximum, possible, vertical, extension, when, in, a, normal, alert, posture, tetrapods, had, a, tooth, structure, known, as, plicidentine, characterized, by, infolding, of, the, enamel, as, seen, in, cross, section, the, more, extreme, version, found, in, early, tetrapods, is, known, as, labyrinthodont, or, labyrinthodont, plicidentine, this, type, of, tooth, structure, has, evolved, independently, in, several, types, of, bony, fishes, both, ray, finned, and, lobe, finned, some, modern, lizards, and, in, a, number, of, tetrapodomorph, fishes, the, infolding, appears, to, evolve, when, a, fang, or, large, tooth, grows, in, a, small, jaw, erupting, when, it, is, still, weak, and, immature, the, infolding, provides, added, strength, to, the, young, tooth, but, offers, little, advantage, when, the, tooth, is, mature, such, teeth, are, associated, with, feeding, on, soft, prey, in, juveniles, with, the, move, from, water, to, land, the, spine, had, to, resist, the, bending, caused, by, body, weight, and, had, to, provide, mobility, where, needed, previously, it, could, bend, along, its, entire, length, likewise, the, paired, appendages, had, not, been, formerly, connected, to, the, spine, but, the, slowly, strengthening, limbs, now, transmitted, their, support, to, the, axis, of, the, body, the, shoulder, girdle, was, disconnected, from, the, skull, resulting, in, improved, terrestrial, locomotion, the, early, sarcopterygians, cleithrum, was, retained, as, the, clavicle, and, the, interclavicle, was, well, developed, lying, on, the, underside, of, the, chest, in, primitive, forms, the, two, clavicles, and, the, interclavical, could, have, grown, ventrally, in, such, a, way, as, to, form, a, broad, chest, plate, the, upper, portion, of, the, girdle, had, a, flat, scapular, blade, shoulder, bone, with, the, glenoid, cavity, situated, below, performing, as, the, articulation, surface, for, the, humerus, while, ventrally, there, was, a, large, flat, coracoid, plate, turning, in, toward, the, midline, the, pelvic, girdle, also, was, much, larger, than, the, simple, plate, found, in, fishes, accommodating, more, muscles, it, extended, far, dorsally, and, was, joined, to, the, backbone, by, one, or, more, specialized, sacral, ribs, the, hind, legs, were, somewhat, specialized, in, that, they, not, only, supported, weight, but, also, provided, propulsion, the, dorsal, extension, of, the, pelvis, was, the, ilium, while, the, broad, ventral, plate, was, composed, of, the, pubis, in, front, and, the, ischium, in, behind, the, three, bones, met, at, a, single, point, in, the, center, of, the, pelvic, triangle, called, the, acetabulum, providing, a, surface, of, articulation, for, the, femur, fleshy, lobe, fins, supported, on, bones, seem, to, have, been, an, ancestral, trait, of, all, bony, fishes, osteichthyes, the, ancestors, of, the, ray, finned, fishes, actinopterygii, evolved, their, fins, in, a, different, direction, the, tetrapodomorph, ancestors, of, the, tetrapods, further, developed, their, lobe, fins, the, paired, fins, had, bones, distinctly, homologous, to, the, humerus, ulna, and, radius, in, the, fore, fins, and, to, the, femur, tibia, and, fibula, in, the, pelvic, fins, the, paired, fins, of, the, early, sarcopterygians, were, smaller, than, tetrapod, limbs, but, the, skeletal, structure, was, very, similar, in, that, the, early, sarcopterygians, had, a, single, proximal, bone, analogous, to, the, humerus, or, femur, two, bones, in, the, next, segment, forearm, or, lower, leg, and, an, irregular, subdivision, of, the, fin, roughly, comparable, to, the, structure, of, the, carpus, tarsus, and, phalanges, of, a, hand, in, typical, early, tetrapod, posture, the, upper, arm, and, upper, leg, extended, nearly, straight, horizontal, from, its, body, and, the, forearm, and, the, lower, leg, extended, downward, from, the, upper, segment, at, a, near, right, angle, the, body, weight, was, not, centered, over, the, limbs, but, was, rather, transferred, 90, degrees, outward, and, down, through, the, lower, limbs, which, touched, the, ground, most, of, the, animal, s, strength, was, used, to, just, lift, its, body, off, the, ground, for, walking, which, was, probably, slow, and, difficult, with, this, sort, of, posture, it, could, only, make, short, broad, strides, this, has, been, confirmed, by, fossilized, footprints, found, in, carboniferous, rocks, early, tetrapods, had, a, wide, gaping, jaw, with, weak, muscles, to, open, and, close, it, in, the, jaw, were, moderate, sized, palatal, and, vomerine, upper, and, coronoid, lower, fangs, as, well, rows, of, smaller, teeth, this, was, in, contrast, to, the, larger, fangs, and, small, marginal, teeth, of, earlier, tetrapodomorph, fishes, such, as, eusthenopteron, although, this, indicates, a, change, in, feeding, habits, the, exact, nature, of, the, change, in, unknown, some, scholars, have, suggested, a, change, to, bottom, feeding, or, feeding, in, shallower, waters, ahlberg, and, milner, 1994, others, have, suggesting, a, mode, of, feeding, comparable, to, that, of, the, japanese, giant, salamander, which, uses, both, suction, feeding, and, direct, biting, to, eat, small, crustaceans, and, fish, a, study, of, these, jaws, shows, that, they, were, used, for, feeding, underwater, not, on, land, in, later, terrestrial, tetrapods, two, methods, of, jaw, closure, emerge, static, and, kinetic, inertial, also, known, as, snapping, in, the, static, system, the, jaw, muscles, are, arranged, in, such, a, way, that, the, jaws, have, maximum, force, when, shut, or, nearly, shut, in, the, kinetic, inertial, system, maximum, force, is, applied, when, the, jaws, are, wide, open, resulting, in, the, jaws, snapping, shut, with, great, velocity, and, momentum, although, the, kinetic, inertial, system, is, occasionally, found, in, fish, it, requires, special, adaptations, such, as, very, narrow, jaws, to, deal, with, the, high, viscosity, and, density, of, water, which, would, otherwise, impede, rapid, jaw, closure, the, tetrapod, tongue, is, built, from, muscles, that, once, controlled, gill, openings, the, tongue, is, anchored, to, the, hyoid, bone, which, was, once, the, lower, half, of, a, pair, of, gill, bars, the, second, pair, after, the, ones, that, evolved, into, jaws, the, tongue, did, not, evolve, until, the, gills, began, to, disappear, acanthostega, still, had, gills, so, this, would, have, been, a, later, development, in, an, aquatically, feeding, animals, the, food, is, supported, by, water, and, can, literally, float, or, get, sucked, in, to, the, mouth, on, land, the, tongue, becomes, important, the, evolution, of, early, tetrapod, respiration, was, influenced, by, an, event, known, as, the, charcoal, gap, a, period, of, more, than, 20, million, years, in, the, middle, and, late, devonian, when, atmospheric, oxygen, levels, were, too, low, to, sustain, wildfires, during, this, time, fish, inhabiting, anoxic, waters, very, low, in, oxygen, would, have, been, under, evolutionary, pressure, to, develop, their, air, breathing, ability, early, tetrapods, probably, relied, on, four, methods, of, respiration, with, lungs, with, gills, cutaneous, respiration, skin, breathing, and, breathing, through, the, lining, of, the, digestive, tract, especially, the, mouth, the, early, tetrapod, acanthostega, had, at, least, three, and, probably, four, pairs, of, gill, bars, each, containing, deep, grooves, in, the, place, where, one, would, expect, to, find, the, afferent, branchial, artery, this, strongly, suggests, that, functional, gills, were, present, some, aquatic, temnospondyls, retained, internal, gills, at, least, into, the, early, jurassic, evidence, of, clear, fish, like, internal, gills, is, present, in, archegosaurus, lungs, originated, as, an, extra, pair, of, pouches, in, the, throat, behind, the, gill, pouches, they, were, probably, present, in, the, last, common, ancestor, of, bony, fishes, in, some, fishes, they, evolved, into, swim, bladders, for, maintaining, buoyancy, lungs, and, swim, bladders, are, homologous, descended, from, a, common, ancestral, form, as, is, the, case, for, the, pulmonary, artery, which, delivers, de, oxygenated, blood, from, the, heart, to, the, lungs, and, the, arteries, that, supply, swim, bladders, air, was, introduced, into, the, lungs, by, a, process, known, as, buccal, pumping, in, the, earliest, tetrapods, exhalation, was, probably, accomplished, with, the, aid, of, the, muscles, of, the, torso, the, thoracoabdominal, region, inhaling, with, the, ribs, was, either, primitive, for, amniotes, or, evolved, independently, in, at, least, two, different, lineages, of, amniotes, it, is, not, found, in, amphibians, the, muscularized, diaphragm, is, unique, to, mammals, although, tetrapods, are, widely, thought, to, have, inhaled, through, buccal, pumping, mouth, pumping, according, to, an, alternative, hypothesis, aspiration, inhalation, occurred, through, passive, recoil, of, the, exoskeleton, in, a, manner, similar, to, the, contemporary, primitive, ray, finned, fish, polypterus, this, fish, inhales, through, its, spiracle, blowhole, an, anatomical, feature, present, in, early, tetrapods, exhalation, is, powered, by, muscles, in, the, torso, during, exhalation, the, bony, scales, in, the, upper, chest, region, become, indented, when, the, muscles, are, relaxed, the, bony, scales, spring, back, into, position, generating, considerable, negative, pressure, within, the, torso, resulting, in, a, very, rapid, intake, of, air, through, the, spiracle, skin, breathing, known, as, cutaneous, respiration, is, common, in, fish, and, amphibians, and, occur, both, in, and, out, of, water, in, some, animals, waterproof, barriers, impede, the, exchange, of, gases, through, the, skin, for, example, keratin, in, human, skin, the, scales, of, reptiles, and, modern, proteinaceous, fish, scales, impede, the, exchange, of, gases, however, early, tetrapods, had, scales, made, of, highly, vascularized, bone, covered, with, skin, for, this, reason, it, is, thought, that, early, tetrapods, could, engage, some, significant, amount, of, skin, breathing, although, air, breathing, fish, can, absorb, oxygen, through, their, lungs, the, lungs, tend, to, be, ineffective, for, discharging, carbon, dioxide, in, tetrapods, the, ability, of, lungs, to, discharge, co, 2, came, about, gradually, and, was, not, fully, attained, until, the, evolution, of, amniotes, the, same, limitation, applies, to, gut, air, breathing, gut, i, e, breathing, with, the, lining, of, the, digestive, tract, tetrapod, skin, would, have, been, effective, for, both, absorbing, oxygen, and, discharging, co, 2, but, only, up, to, a, point, for, this, reason, early, tetrapods, may, have, experienced, chronic, hypercapnia, high, levels, of, blood, co, 2, this, is, not, uncommon, in, fish, that, inhabit, waters, high, in, co, 2, according, to, one, hypothesis, the, sculpted, or, ornamented, dermal, skull, roof, bones, found, in, early, tetrapods, may, have, been, related, to, a, mechanism, for, relieving, respiratory, acidosis, acidic, blood, caused, by, excess, co, 2, through, compensatory, metabolic, alkalosis, early, tetrapods, probably, had, a, three, chambered, heart, as, do, modern, amphibians, and, lepidosaurian, and, chelonian, reptiles, in, which, oxygenated, blood, from, the, lungs, and, de, oxygenated, blood, from, the, respiring, tissues, enters, by, separate, atria, and, is, directed, via, a, spiral, valve, to, the, appropriate, vessel, aorta, for, oxygenated, blood, and, pulmonary, vein, for, deoxygenated, blood, the, spiral, valve, is, essential, to, keeping, the, mixing, of, the, two, types, of, blood, to, a, minimum, enabling, the, animal, to, have, higher, metabolic, rates, and, be, more, active, than, otherwise, the, difference, in, density, between, air, and, water, causes, smells, certain, chemical, compounds, detectable, by, chemoreceptors, to, behave, differently, an, animal, first, venturing, out, onto, land, would, have, difficulty, in, locating, such, chemical, signals, if, its, sensory, apparatus, had, evolved, in, the, context, of, aquatic, detection, the, vomeronasal, organ, also, evolved, in, the, nasal, cavity, for, the, first, time, for, detecting, pheromones, from, biological, substrates, on, land, though, it, was, subsequently, lost, or, reduced, to, vestigial, in, some, lineages, like, archosaurs, and, catarrhines, but, expanded, in, others, like, lepidosaurs, fish, have, a, lateral, line, system, that, detects, pressure, fluctuations, in, the, water, such, pressure, is, non, detectable, in, air, but, grooves, for, the, lateral, line, sense, organs, were, found, on, the, skull, of, early, tetrapods, suggesting, either, an, aquatic, or, largely, aquatic, habitat, modern, amphibians, which, are, semi, aquatic, exhibit, this, feature, whereas, it, has, been, retired, by, the, higher, vertebrates, changes, in, the, eye, came, about, because, the, behavior, of, light, at, the, surface, of, the, eye, differs, between, an, air, and, water, environment, due, to, the, difference, in, refractive, index, so, the, focal, length, of, the, lens, altered, to, function, in, air, the, eye, was, now, exposed, to, a, relatively, dry, environment, rather, than, being, bathed, by, water, so, eyelids, developed, and, tear, ducts, evolved, to, produce, a, liquid, to, moisten, the, eyeball, early, tetrapods, inherited, a, set, of, five, rod, and, cone, opsins, known, as, the, vertebrate, opsins, four, cone, opsins, were, present, in, the, first, vertebrate, inherited, from, invertebrate, ancestors, a, single, rod, opsin, rhodopsin, was, present, in, the, first, jawed, vertebrate, inherited, from, a, jawless, vertebrate, ancestor, tetrapods, retained, the, balancing, function, of, the, inner, ear, from, fish, ancestry, air, vibrations, could, not, set, up, pulsations, through, the, skull, as, in, a, proper, auditory, organ, the, spiracle, was, retained, as, the, otic, notch, eventually, closed, in, by, the, tympanum, a, thin, tight, membrane, of, connective, tissue, also, called, the, eardrum, however, this, and, the, otic, notch, were, lost, in, the, ancestral, amniotes, and, later, eardrums, were, obtained, independently, the, hyomandibula, of, fish, migrated, upwards, from, its, jaw, supporting, position, and, was, reduced, in, size, to, form, the, columella, situated, between, the, tympanum, and, braincase, in, an, air, filled, cavity, the, columella, was, now, capable, of, transmitting, vibrations, from, the, exterior, of, the, head, to, the, interior, thus, the, columella, became, an, important, element, in, an, impedance, matching, system, coupling, airborne, sound, waves, to, the, receptor, system, of, the, inner, ear, this, system, had, evolved, independently, within, several, different, amphibian, lineages, the, impedance, matching, ear, had, to, meet, certain, conditions, to, work, the, columella, had, to, be, perpendicular, to, the, tympanum, small, and, light, enough, to, reduce, its, inertia, and, suspended, in, an, air, filled, cavity, in, modern, species, that, are, sensitive, to, over, 1, khz, frequencies, the, footplate, of, the, columella, is, 1, 20th, the, area, of, the, tympanum, however, in, early, amphibians, the, columella, was, too, large, making, the, footplate, area, oversized, preventing, the, hearing, of, high, frequencies, so, it, appears, they, could, only, hear, high, intensity, low, frequency, sounds, and, the, columella, more, probably, just, supported, the, brain, case, against, the, cheek, only, in, the, early, triassic, about, a, hundred, million, years, after, they, conquered, land, did, the, tympanic, middle, ear, evolve, independently, in, all, the, tetrapod, lineages, about, fifty, million, years, later, late, triassic, in, mammals, the, columella, was, reduced, even, further, to, become, the, stapes
