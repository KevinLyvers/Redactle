ovenbirds, or, furnariids, are, a, large, family, of, small, suboscine, passerine, birds, found, from, mexico, and, central, to, southern, south, america, they, form, the, family, furnariidae, this, is, a, large, family, containing, around, 315, species, and, 70, genera, the, ovenbird, seiurus, aurocapilla, which, breeds, in, north, america, is, not, a, furnariid, rather, it, is, a, distantly, related, bird, of, the, wood, warbler, family, parulidae, the, ovenbirds, are, a, diverse, group, of, insectivores, which, get, their, name, from, the, elaborate, vaguely, oven, like, clay, nests, built, by, the, horneros, although, most, other, ovenbirds, build, stick, nests, or, nest, in, tunnels, or, clefts, in, rock, the, spanish, word, for, oven, horno, gives, the, horneros, their, name, furnariid, nests, are, always, constructed, with, a, cover, and, up, to, six, pale, blue, greenish, or, white, eggs, are, laid, the, eggs, hatch, after, 15, to, 22, days, and, the, young, fledge, after, a, further, 13, to, 20, days, they, are, small, to, medium, sized, birds, ranging, from, 9, to, 35, cm, in, length, while, individual, species, often, are, habitat, specialists, species, of, this, family, can, be, found, in, virtually, any, neotropical, habitat, ranging, from, city, parks, inhabited, by, rufous, horneros, to, tropical, amazonian, lowlands, by, many, species, of, foliage, gleaners, to, temperate, barren, andean, highlands, inhabited, by, several, species, of, miners, two, species, the, seaside, and, the, surf, cinclodes, are, associated, with, rocky, coasts, the, woodcreepers, formerly, dendrocolaptidae, were, merged, into, this, family, following, analysis, of, sequences, while, confirming, the, overall, phylogenetic, pattern, other, scientists, instead, opted, for, maintaining, the, woodcreepers, as, a, separate, family, while, splitting, the, ovenbirds, as, traditionally, defined, into, two, families, furnariidae, and, scleruridae, the, cladogram, below, showing, the, subfamilies, of, the, ovenbirds, is, based, on, a, molecular, genetic, studies, that, revealed, that, sclerurinae, was, the, first, group, to, diverge, the, species, numbers, are, from, the, list, maintained, by, the, international, ornithologists, union, ioc, sclerurinae, miners, and, leaftosser, 18, species, dendrocolaptinae, woodcreepers, 58, species, furnariinae, true, ovenbirds, 239, species, the, phylogeny, of, the, furnariidae, is, now, well, understood, thanks, to, multiple, analyses, of, nuclear, and, mitochondrial, dna, among, other, discoveries, the, classification, of, several, genera, had, to, be, revised, the, taxonomic, arrangement, presented, below, is, based, on, molecular, genetic, studies, of, ovenbird, relationships, however, because, ovenbirds, and, woodcreepers, are, treated, here, as, a, single, family, some, taxonomic, ranks, were, modified, for, more, detail, see, list, of, ovenbird, species, subfamily, sclerurinae, miners, and, leaftossers, subfamily, dendrocolaptinae, woodcreepers, subfamily, furnariinae, neotropical, ovenbirds, and, allies, the, phylogenetic, tree, shown, below, is, based, on, a, large, scale, genetic, 2020, study, of, the, suboscines, by, michael, harvey, and, collaborators, the, tawny, tit, spinetail, leptasthenura, yanacencis, has, been, moved, to, the, genus, sylviorthorhynchus, the, sulphur, bearded, spinetail, cranioleuca, sulphurifera, has, been, moved, to, the, genus, limnoctites, and, its, english, name, changed, to, the, sulphur, bearded, reedhaunter, and, the, white, bellied, spinetail, synallaxis, propinqua, has, been, placed, in, the, monotypic, genus, mazaria, these, changes, are, included, in, the, tree, shown, below, the, remaining, paraphyletic, genera, are, flagged, in, the, tree, by, an, asterisk, in, 2009, the, large, ovenbird, family, was, divided, into, tribes, by, robert, moyle, and, collaborators, the, tribes, as, defined, in, the, 2009, article, do, not, fit, well, with, the, revised, taxonomy, of, harvey, and, are, not, included, here, for, example, the, tribe, furnariini, as, defined, in, the, 2009, article, is, not, monophyletic, in, the,
