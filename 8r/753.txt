the, mustelidae, m, s, t, l, d, i, from, latin, mustela, weasel, are, a, diverse, family, of, carnivoran, mammals, including, weasels, badgers, otters, polecats, martens, grisons, and, wolverines, otherwise, known, as, mustelids, m, s, t, l, d, z, they, form, the, largest, family, in, the, suborder, caniformia, of, the, order, carnivora, with, about, 66, to, 70, species, in, nine, subfamilies, mustelids, vary, greatly, in, size, and, behaviour, the, smaller, variants, of, the, least, weasel, can, be, under, 20, cm, 8, in, in, length, while, the, giant, otter, of, amazonian, south, america, can, measure, up, to, 1, 7, m, 5, ft, 7, in, and, sea, otters, can, exceed, 45, kg, 99, lb, in, weight, wolverines, can, crush, bones, as, thick, as, the, femur, of, a, moose, to, get, at, the, marrow, and, have, been, seen, attempting, to, drive, bears, away, from, their, kills, the, sea, otter, uses, rocks, to, break, open, shellfish, to, eat, martens, are, largely, arboreal, while, european, badgers, dig, extensive, tunnel, networks, called, setts, only, one, mustelid, has, been, domesticated, the, ferret, tayra, are, also, kept, as, pets, although, they, require, a, dangerous, wild, animals, licence, in, the, uk, or, as, working, animals, for, hunting, or, vermin, control, others, have, been, important, in, the, fur, trade, the, mink, is, often, raised, for, its, fur, being, one, of, the, most, species, rich, families, in, the, order, carnivora, the, family, mustelidae, also, is, one, of, the, oldest, mustelid, like, forms, first, appeared, about, 40, million, years, ago, mya, roughly, coinciding, with, the, appearance, of, rodents, the, common, ancestor, of, modern, mustelids, appeared, about, 18, mya, within, a, large, range, of, variation, the, mustelids, exhibit, some, common, characteristics, they, are, typically, small, animals, with, elongated, bodies, short, legs, short, skulls, short, round, ears, and, thick, fur, most, mustelids, are, solitary, nocturnal, animals, and, are, active, year, round, with, the, exception, of, the, sea, otter, they, have, anal, scent, glands, that, produce, a, strong, smelling, secretion, the, animals, use, for, sexual, signalling, and, marking, territory, most, mustelid, reproduction, involves, embryonic, diapause, the, embryo, does, not, immediately, implant, in, the, uterus, but, remains, dormant, for, some, time, no, development, takes, place, as, long, as, the, embryo, remains, unattached, to, the, uterine, lining, as, a, result, the, normal, gestation, period, is, extended, sometimes, up, to, a, year, this, allows, the, young, to, be, born, under, favourable, environmental, conditions, reproduction, has, a, large, energy, cost, so, it, is, to, a, female, s, benefit, to, have, available, food, and, mild, weather, the, young, are, more, likely, to, survive, if, birth, occurs, after, previous, offspring, have, been, weaned, mustelids, are, predominantly, carnivorous, although, some, eat, vegetable, matter, at, times, while, not, all, mustelids, share, an, identical, dentition, they, all, possess, teeth, adapted, for, eating, flesh, including, the, presence, of, shearing, carnassials, one, characteristic, trait, is, a, meat, shearing, upper, back, molar, that, is, rotated, 90, towards, the, inside, of, the, mouth, with, variation, between, species, the, most, common, dental, formula, is, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, the, fisher, tayra, and, martens, are, partially, arboreal, while, badgers, are, fossorial, a, number, of, mustelids, have, aquatic, lifestyles, ranging, from, semiaquatic, minks, and, river, otters, to, the, fully, aquatic, sea, otter, which, is, one, of, the, few, nonprimate, mammals, known, to, use, tools, while, foraging, it, uses, anvil, stones, to, crack, open, the, shellfish, that, form, a, significant, part, of, its, diet, it, is, a, keystone, species, keeping, its, prey, populations, in, balance, so, some, do, not, outcompete, the, others, and, destroy, the, kelp, in, which, they, live, the, black, footed, ferret, is, entirely, dependent, on, another, keystone, species, the, prairie, dog, a, family, of, four, ferrets, eats, 250, prairie, dogs, in, a, year, this, requires, a, stable, population, of, prairie, dogs, from, an, area, of, some, 500, acres, 2, 0, km, 2, skunks, were, previously, included, as, a, subfamily, of, the, mustelids, but, dna, research, placed, them, in, their, own, separate, family, mephitidae, mongooses, bear, a, striking, resemblance, to, many, mustelids, but, belong, to, a, distinctly, different, suborder, the, feliformia, all, those, carnivores, sharing, more, recent, origins, with, the, cats, and, not, the, caniformia, those, sharing, more, recent, origins, with, the, dogs, because, mongooses, and, mustelids, occupy, similar, ecological, niches, convergent, evolution, has, led, to, similarity, in, form, and, behavior, several, mustelids, including, the, mink, the, sable, a, type, of, marten, and, the, stoat, ermine, possess, furs, that, are, considered, beautiful, and, valuable, so, have, been, hunted, since, prehistoric, times, from, the, early, middle, ages, the, trade, in, furs, was, of, great, economic, importance, for, northern, and, eastern, european, nations, with, large, native, populations, of, fur, bearing, mustelids, and, was, a, major, economic, impetus, behind, russian, expansion, into, siberia, and, french, and, english, expansion, in, north, america, in, recent, centuries, fur, farming, notably, of, mink, has, also, become, widespread, and, provides, the, majority, of, the, fur, brought, to, market, one, species, the, sea, mink, neogale, macrodon, of, new, england, and, canada, was, driven, to, extinction, by, fur, trappers, its, appearance, and, habits, are, almost, unknown, today, because, no, complete, specimens, can, be, found, and, no, systematic, contemporary, studies, were, conducted, the, sea, otter, which, has, the, densest, fur, of, any, animal, narrowly, escaped, the, fate, of, the, sea, mink, the, discovery, of, large, populations, in, the, north, pacific, was, the, major, economic, driving, force, behind, russian, expansion, into, kamchatka, the, aleutian, islands, and, alaska, as, well, as, a, cause, for, conflict, with, japan, and, foreign, hunters, in, the, kuril, islands, together, with, widespread, hunting, in, california, and, british, columbia, the, species, was, brought, to, the, brink, of, extinction, until, an, international, moratorium, came, into, effect, in, 1911, today, some, mustelids, are, threatened, for, other, reasons, sea, otters, are, vulnerable, to, oil, spills, and, the, indirect, effects, of, overfishing, the, black, footed, ferret, a, relative, of, the, european, polecat, suffers, from, the, loss, of, american, prairie, and, wolverine, populations, are, slowly, declining, because, of, habitat, destruction, and, persecution, the, rare, european, mink, mustela, lutreola, is, one, of, the, most, endangered, mustelid, species, the, ferret, a, domesticated, european, polecat, is, a, fairly, common, pet, the, oldest, known, mustelid, from, north, america, is, corumictis, wolsani, from, the, early, and, late, oligocene, early, and, late, arikareean, ar1, ar3, of, oregon, middle, oligocene, mustelictis, from, europe, might, be, a, mustelid, as, well, other, early, fossils, of, the, mustelids, were, dated, at, the, end, of, the, oligocene, to, the, beginning, of, the, miocene, which, of, these, forms, are, mustelidae, ancestors, and, which, should, be, considered, the, first, mustelids, is, unclear, the, fossil, record, indicates, that, mustelids, appeared, in, the, late, oligocene, period, 33, mya, in, eurasia, and, migrated, to, every, continent, except, antarctica, and, australia, all, the, continents, that, were, connected, during, or, since, the, early, miocene, they, reached, the, americas, via, the, bering, land, bridge, the, 68, recent, mustelids, 66, extant, species, are, classified, into, eight, subfamilies, in, 22, genera, subfamily, mellivorinae, subfamily, melinae, subfamily, helictidinae, subfamily, guloninae, subfamily, ictonychinae, subfamily, lutrinae, otters, subfamily, mustelinae, weasels, ferrets, and, mink, fossil, mustelids, extinct, genera, of, the, family, mustelidae, include, multigene, phylogenies, constructed, by, koepfli, et, al, 2008, and, law, et, al, 2018, found, that, mustelidae, comprises, eight, living, subfamilies, the, early, mustelids, appear, to, have, undergone, two, rapid, bursts, of, diversification, in, eurasia, with, the, resulting, species, spreading, to, other, continents, only, later, mustelid, species, diversity, is, often, attributed, to, an, adaptive, radiation, coinciding, with, the, mid, miocene, climate, transition, contrary, to, expectations, law, et, al, 2018, found, no, evidence, for, rapid, bursts, of, lineage, diversification, at, the, origin, of, the, mustelidae, and, further, analyses, of, lineage, diversification, rates, using, molecular, and, fossil, based, methods, did, not, find, associations, between, rates, of, lineage, diversification, and, mid, miocene, climate, transition, as, previously, hypothesized
