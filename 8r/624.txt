terns, are, seabirds, in, the, family, laridae, subfamily, sterninae, that, have, a, worldwide, distribution, and, are, normally, found, near, the, sea, rivers, or, wetlands, terns, are, treated, in, eleven, genera, in, a, subgroup, of, the, family, laridae, which, also, includes, several, genera, of, gulls, and, the, skimmers, rynchops, they, are, slender, lightly, built, birds, with, long, forked, tails, narrow, wings, long, bills, and, relatively, short, legs, most, species, are, pale, grey, above, and, white, below, with, a, contrasting, black, cap, to, the, head, but, the, marsh, terns, the, black, bellied, tern, the, inca, tern, and, some, noddies, have, dark, body, plumage, for, at, least, part, of, the, year, the, sexes, are, identical, in, appearance, but, young, birds, are, readily, distinguishable, from, adults, terns, have, a, non, breeding, plumage, which, usually, involves, a, white, forehead, and, much, reduced, black, cap, terns, are, long, lived, birds, and, are, relatively, free, from, natural, predators, and, parasites, most, species, are, declining, in, numbers, due, directly, or, indirectly, to, human, activities, including, habitat, loss, pollution, disturbance, and, predation, by, introduced, mammals, the, chinese, crested, tern, is, critically, endangered, and, three, other, species, are, classed, as, endangered, international, agreements, provide, a, measure, of, protection, but, adults, and, eggs, of, some, species, are, still, used, for, food, in, the, tropics, terns, range, in, size, from, the, least, tern, at, 23, cm, 9, 1, in, in, length, and, weighing, 30, 45, g, 1, 1, 1, 6, oz, to, the, caspian, tern, at, 48, 56, cm, 19, 22, in, 500, 700, g, 18, 25, oz, they, are, longer, billed, lighter, bodied, and, more, streamlined, than, gulls, and, their, long, tails, and, long, narrow, wings, give, them, an, elegance, in, flight, male, and, female, plumages, are, identical, although, the, male, can, be, 2, 5, larger, than, the, female, and, often, has, a, relatively, larger, bill, sea, terns, have, deeply, forked, tails, and, at, least, a, shallow, v, is, shown, by, all, other, species, the, noddies, genera, anous, procelsterna, and, gygis, have, unusual, notched, wedge, shaped, tails, the, longest, tail, feathers, being, the, middle, outer, rather, than, the, central, or, outermost, although, their, legs, are, short, terns, can, run, well, they, rarely, swim, despite, having, webbed, feet, usually, landing, on, water, only, to, bathe, the, majority, of, sea, terns, have, light, grey, or, white, body, plumage, as, adults, with, a, black, cap, to, the, head, the, legs, and, bill, are, various, combinations, of, red, orange, yellow, or, black, depending, on, species, the, pale, plumage, is, conspicuous, from, a, distance, at, sea, and, may, attract, other, birds, to, a, good, feeding, area, for, these, fish, eating, species, when, seen, against, the, sky, the, white, underparts, also, help, to, hide, the, hunting, bird, from, its, intended, prey, the, inca, tern, has, mainly, dark, plumage, and, three, species, that, mainly, eat, insects, black, tern, white, winged, tern, and, black, bellied, tern, have, black, underparts, in, the, breeding, season, three, of, the, anous, noddies, have, dark, plumage, with, a, pale, head, cap, the, other, two, formerly, separated, in, the, genus, procelsterna, paler, grey, the, reason, for, their, dark, plumage, is, unknown, but, it, has, been, suggested, that, in, tropical, areas, where, food, resources, are, scarce, the, less, conspicuous, colouration, makes, it, harder, for, other, noddies, to, detect, a, feeding, bird, plumage, type, especially, the, head, pattern, is, linked, to, the, phylogeny, of, the, terns, and, the, pale, capped, dark, bodied, noddies, are, believed, to, have, diverged, earlier, than, the, other, genera, from, an, ancestral, white, headed, gull, followed, by, the, partially, black, headed, onychoprion, and, sternula, groupings, juvenile, terns, typically, have, brown, or, yellow, tinged, upperparts, and, the, feathers, have, dark, edges, that, give, the, plumage, a, scaly, appearance, they, have, dark, bands, on, the, wings, and, short, tails, in, most, species, the, subsequent, moult, does, not, start, until, after, migration, the, plumage, then, becoming, more, like, the, adult, but, with, some, retained, juvenile, feathers, and, a, white, forehead, with, only, a, partial, dark, cap, by, the, second, summer, the, appearance, is, very, like, the, adult, and, full, mature, plumage, is, usually, attained, by, the, third, year, after, breeding, terns, moult, into, a, winter, plumage, typically, showing, a, white, forehead, heavily, worn, or, aberrant, plumages, such, as, melanism, and, albinism, are, much, rarer, in, terns, than, in, gulls, terns, have, a, wide, repertoire, of, vocalisations, for, example, the, common, tern, has, a, distinctive, alarm, kee, yah, also, used, as, a, warning, to, intruders, and, a, shorter, kyar, given, as, an, individual, takes, flight, in, response, to, a, more, serious, threat, this, quietens, the, usually, noisy, colony, while, its, residents, assess, the, danger, other, calls, include, a, down, slurred, keeur, given, when, an, adult, is, approaching, the, nest, with, a, fish, and, a, kip, uttered, during, social, contact, parents, and, chicks, can, locate, one, another, by, call, and, siblings, also, recognise, each, other, s, vocalisations, from, about, the, twelfth, day, after, hatching, which, helps, to, keep, the, brood, together, vocal, differences, reinforce, species, separation, between, closely, related, birds, such, as, the, least, and, little, terns, and, can, help, humans, distinguish, similar, species, such, as, common, and, arctic, terns, since, flight, calls, are, unique, to, each, species, the, bird, order, charadriiformes, contains, 18, coastal, seabird, and, wader, families, within, the, order, the, terns, form, a, lineage, with, the, gulls, and, less, closely, with, the, skimmers, skuas, and, auks, early, authors, such, as, conrad, gessner, francis, willughby, and, william, turner, did, not, clearly, separate, terns, from, gulls, but, linnaeus, recognised, the, distinction, in, his, 1758, systema, naturae, placing, the, gulls, in, the, genus, larus, and, the, terns, in, sterna, he, gave, sterna, the, description, rostrum, subulatum, awl, shaped, bill, referring, to, the, long, pointed, bills, typical, of, this, group, of, birds, a, feature, that, distinguishes, them, from, the, thicker, billed, gulls, behaviour, and, morphology, suggest, that, the, terns, are, more, closely, related, to, the, gulls, than, to, the, skimmers, or, skuas, and, although, charles, lucien, bonaparte, created, the, family, sternidae, for, the, terns, in, 1838, for, many, years, they, were, considered, to, be, a, subfamily, sterninae, of, the, gull, family, laridae, relationships, between, various, tern, species, and, between, the, terns, and, the, other, charadriiformes, were, formerly, difficult, to, resolve, because, of, a, poor, fossil, record, and, the, misidentification, of, some, finds, following, genetic, research, in, the, early, twenty, first, century, the, terns, were, historically, treated, as, a, separate, family, sternidae, most, terns, were, formerly, treated, as, belonging, to, one, large, genus, sterna, with, just, a, few, dark, species, placed, in, other, genera, in, one, 1959, paper, only, the, noddies, and, the, inca, tern, were, excluded, from, sterna, a, recent, analysis, of, dna, sequences, supported, the, splitting, of, sterna, into, several, smaller, genera, one, study, of, part, of, the, cytochrome, b, gene, sequence, found, a, close, relationship, between, terns, and, a, group, of, waders, in, the, suborder, thinocori, these, results, are, in, disagreement, with, other, molecular, and, morphological, studies, and, have, been, interpreted, as, showing, either, a, large, degree, of, molecular, convergent, evolution, between, the, terns, and, these, waders, or, the, retention, of, an, ancient, genotype, research, in, 2007, had, suggested, that, the, noddies, were, not, terns, at, all, but, were, basal, to, all, the, other, genera, in, laridae, a, taxonomy, that, was, followed, by, the, ioc, world, bird, list, for, several, years, up, to, 2023, but, more, comprehensive, analysis, has, now, shown, that, the, noddies, are, basal, to, only, the, other, terns, not, the, whole, family, this, has, now, been, followed, by, the, ioc, world, bird, list, version, 14, 1, in, 2024, the, word, stearn, was, used, for, these, birds, in, old, english, as, early, as, the, eighth, century, and, appears, in, the, poem, the, seafarer, written, in, the, ninth, century, or, earlier, variants, such, as, tearn, occurred, by, the, eleventh, century, although, the, older, form, lingered, on, in, norfolk, dialect, for, several, centuries, as, now, the, term, was, used, for, the, inland, black, tern, as, well, as, the, marine, species, some, authorities, consider, tearn, and, similar, forms, to, be, variants, of, stearn, while, others, derive, the, english, words, from, scandinavian, equivalents, such, as, danish, and, norwegian, terne, or, swedish, t, rna, and, ultimately, from, old, norse, erna, linnaeus, adopted, stearn, or, sterna, which, the, naturalist, william, turner, had, used, in, 1544, as, a, latinisation, of, an, english, word, presumably, stern, for, the, black, tern, or, a, north, germanic, equivalent, for, his, genus, name, sterna, the, cladogram, shows, the, relationships, between, the, tern, genera, and, the, currently, recognised, species, based, on, mitochondrial, dna, studies, are, listed, below, anous, gygis, onychoprion, sternula, phaetusa, gelochelidon, hydroprogne, larosterna, chlidonias, thalasseus, sterna, in, addition, to, extant, species, the, fossil, record, includes, a, miocene, palaeospecies, sterna, milne, edwardsii, the, genera, anous, procelsterna, and, gygis, are, collectively, known, as, noddies, the, chlidonias, species, are, the, marsh, terns, and, all, other, species, comprise, the, sea, terns, terns, have, a, worldwide, distribution, breeding, on, all, continents, including, antarctica, the, northernmost, and, southernmost, breeders, are, the, arctic, tern, and, antarctic, tern, respectively, many, terns, breeding, in, temperate, zones, are, long, distance, migrants, and, the, arctic, tern, sees, more, annual, daylight, than, any, other, animal, as, it, migrates, from, its, northern, breeding, grounds, to, antarctic, waters, a, return, journey, of, more, than, 30, 000, km, 19, 000, mi, a, common, tern, that, hatched, in, sweden, and, was, found, dead, five, months, later, on, stewart, island, new, zealand, must, have, flown, at, least, 25, 000, km, 16, 000, mi, actual, flight, distances, are, of, course, much, greater, than, the, shortest, possible, route, arctic, terns, from, greenland, were, shown, by, radio, geolocation, to, average, 70, 000, km, 43, 000, mi, on, their, annual, migrations, while, another, from, the, farne, islands, in, northumberland, tagged, g82, covered, a, staggering, 96, 000, km, in, just, 10, months, from, the, end, of, one, breeding, season, to, the, start, of, the, next, travelling, not, just, the, length, of, the, atlantic, ocean, and, the, width, of, the, indian, ocean, but, also, half, way, across, the, south, pacific, to, the, boundary, between, the, ross, and, amundsen, seas, before, returning, back, west, most, terns, breed, on, open, sandy, or, rocky, areas, on, coasts, and, islands, the, yellow, billed, large, billed, and, black, fronted, terns, breed, only, on, rivers, and, common, least, and, little, terns, also, sometimes, use, inland, locations, the, marsh, terns, trudeau, s, tern, and, some, forster, s, terns, nest, in, inland, marshes, the, black, noddy, and, the, white, tern, nest, above, ground, level, on, cliffs, or, in, trees, migratory, terns, move, to, the, coast, after, breeding, and, most, species, winter, near, land, although, some, marine, species, like, the, aleutian, tern, may, wander, far, from, land, the, sooty, tern, is, entirely, oceanic, when, not, breeding, and, healthy, young, birds, are, not, seen, on, land, for, up, to, five, years, after, fledging, until, they, return, to, breed, they, lack, waterproof, plumage, so, they, cannot, rest, on, the, sea, where, they, spend, the, years, prior, to, breeding, is, unknown, the, terns, are, birds, of, open, habitats, that, typically, breed, in, noisy, colonies, and, lay, their, eggs, on, bare, ground, with, little, or, no, nest, material, marsh, terns, construct, floating, nests, from, the, vegetation, in, their, wetland, habitats, and, a, few, species, build, simple, nests, in, trees, on, cliffs, or, in, crevices, the, white, tern, uniquely, lays, its, single, egg, on, a, bare, tree, branch, depending, on, the, species, one, to, three, eggs, make, up, the, clutch, most, species, feed, on, fish, caught, by, diving, from, flight, but, the, marsh, terns, are, insect, eaters, and, some, large, terns, will, supplement, their, diet, with, small, land, vertebrates, many, terns, are, long, distance, migrants, and, the, arctic, tern, may, see, more, daylight, in, a, year, than, any, other, animal, terns, are, normally, monogamous, although, trios, or, female, female, pairings, have, been, observed, in, at, least, three, species, most, terns, breed, annually, and, at, the, same, time, of, year, but, some, tropical, species, may, nest, at, intervals, shorter, than, 12, months, or, asynchronously, most, terns, become, sexually, mature, when, aged, three, although, some, small, species, may, breed, in, their, second, year, some, large, sea, terns, including, the, sooty, and, bridled, terns, are, four, or, older, when, they, first, breed, terns, normally, breed, in, colonies, and, are, site, faithful, if, their, habitat, is, sufficiently, stable, a, few, species, nest, in, small, or, dispersed, groups, but, most, breed, in, colonies, of, up, to, a, few, hundred, pairs, often, alongside, other, seabirds, such, as, gulls, or, skimmers, large, tern, species, tend, to, form, larger, colonies, which, in, the, case, of, the, sooty, tern, can, contain, up, to, two, million, pairs, large, species, nest, very, close, together, and, sit, tightly, making, it, difficult, for, aerial, predators, to, land, among, them, smaller, species, are, less, closely, packed, and, mob, intruders, peruvian, and, damara, terns, have, small, dispersed, colonies, and, rely, on, the, cryptic, plumage, of, the, eggs, and, young, for, protection, the, male, selects, a, territory, which, he, defends, against, conspecifics, and, re, establishes, a, pair, bond, with, his, mate, or, attracts, a, new, female, if, necessary, courtship, involves, ritualised, flight, and, ground, displays, and, the, male, often, presents, a, fish, to, his, partner, most, species, have, little, or, no, nest, laying, the, eggs, onto, bare, ground, but, trudeau, s, tern, forster, s, tern, and, the, marsh, terns, construct, floating, nests, from, the, vegetation, in, their, wetland, habitats, black, and, lesser, noddies, build, nests, of, twigs, feathers, and, excreta, on, tree, branches, and, brown, blue, and, grey, noddies, make, rough, platforms, of, grass, and, seaweed, on, cliff, ledges, in, cavities, or, on, other, rocky, surfaces, the, inca, tern, nests, in, crevices, caves, and, disused, burrows, such, as, that, of, a, humboldt, penguin, the, white, tern, is, unique, in, that, it, lays, its, single, egg, on, a, bare, tree, branch, tropical, species, usually, lay, just, one, egg, but, two, or, three, is, typical, in, cooler, regions, if, there, is, an, adequate, food, supply, the, time, taken, to, complete, the, clutch, varies, but, for, temperate, species, incubation, takes, 21, 28, days, the, eggs, of, most, gulls, and, terns, are, brown, with, dark, splotches, so, they, are, difficult, for, predators, to, spot, on, the, beach, the, precocial, chicks, fledge, in, about, four, weeks, after, hatching, tropical, species, take, longer, because, of, the, poorer, food, supply, both, parents, incubate, the, eggs, and, feed, the, chicks, although, the, female, does, more, incubating, and, less, fishing, than, her, partner, young, birds, migrate, with, the, adults, terns, are, generally, long, lived, birds, with, individuals, typically, returning, for, 7, 10, breeding, seasons, maximum, known, ages, include, 34, for, an, arctic, tern, and, 32, for, a, sooty, although, several, other, species, are, known, to, live, in, captivity, for, up, to, 20, years, their, greatest, recorded, ages, are, underestimates, because, the, birds, can, outlive, their, rings, interbreeding, between, tern, species, is, rare, and, involves, closely, related, species, when, it, occurs, hybrids, recorded, include, common, tern, with, roseate, sandwich, with, lesser, crested, and, black, with, white, winged, most, terns, hunt, fish, by, diving, often, hovering, first, and, the, particular, approach, technique, used, can, help, to, distinguish, similar, species, at, a, distance, sea, terns, often, hunt, in, association, with, porpoises, or, predatory, fish, such, as, bluefish, tuna, or, bonitos, since, these, large, marine, animals, drive, the, prey, to, the, surface, sooty, terns, feed, at, night, as, the, fish, rise, to, the, surface, and, are, believed, to, sleep, on, the, wing, since, they, become, waterlogged, easily, terns, of, several, species, will, feed, on, invertebrates, following, the, plough, or, hunting, on, foot, on, mudflats, the, marsh, terns, normally, catch, insects, in, the, air, or, pick, them, off, the, surface, of, fresh, water, other, species, will, sometimes, use, these, techniques, if, the, opportunity, arises, an, individual, tern, s, foraging, efficiency, increases, with, its, age, the, gull, billed, tern, is, an, opportunist, predator, taking, a, wide, variety, of, prey, from, marine, freshwater, and, terrestrial, habitats, depending, on, what, is, available, it, will, eat, small, crabs, fish, crayfish, grasshoppers, and, other, large, insects, lizards, and, amphibians, warm, blooded, prey, includes, mice, and, the, eggs, and, chicks, of, other, beach, breeding, birds, least, terns, little, terns, and, members, of, its, own, species, may, be, victims, the, greater, crested, tern, will, also, occasionally, catch, unusual, vertebrate, species, such, as, agamid, lizards, and, green, sea, turtle, hatchlings, and, follows, trawlers, for, discards, the, eyes, of, terns, cannot, accommodate, under, water, so, they, rely, on, accurate, sighting, from, the, air, before, they, plunge, dive, like, other, seabirds, that, feed, at, the, surface, or, dive, for, food, terns, have, red, oil, droplets, in, the, cones, of, their, retinas, birds, that, have, to, look, through, an, air, water, interface, have, more, deeply, coloured, carotenoid, pigments, in, the, oil, drops, than, other, species, the, pigment, also, improves, visual, contrast, and, sharpens, distance, vision, especially, in, hazy, conditions, and, helps, terns, to, locate, shoals, of, fish, although, it, is, uncertain, whether, they, are, sighting, the, phytoplankton, on, which, the, fish, feed, or, other, feeding, birds, the, red, colouring, reduces, ultraviolet, sensitivity, which, in, any, case, is, an, adaptation, more, suited, to, terrestrial, feeders, like, the, gulls, and, this, protects, the, eye, from, uv, damage, the, inaccessibility, of, many, tern, colonies, gave, them, a, measure, of, protection, from, mammalian, predators, especially, on, islands, but, introduced, species, brought, by, humans, can, seriously, affect, breeding, birds, these, can, be, predators, such, as, foxes, raccoons, cats, and, rats, or, animals, that, destroy, the, habitat, including, rabbits, goats, and, pigs, problems, arise, not, only, on, formerly, mammal, free, islands, as, in, new, zealand, but, also, where, an, alien, carnivore, such, as, the, american, mink, in, scotland, presents, an, unfamiliar, threat, adult, terns, may, be, hunted, by, owls, and, raptors, and, their, chicks, and, eggs, may, be, taken, by, herons, crows, or, gulls, less, obvious, nest, predators, include, ruddy, turnstones, in, the, arctic, and, gull, billed, terns, in, little, tern, colonies, adults, may, be, robbed, of, their, catch, by, avian, kleptoparasites, such, as, frigatebirds, skuas, other, terns, or, large, gulls, external, parasites, include, chewing, lice, of, the, genus, saemundssonia, feather, lice, and, fleas, such, as, ceratophyllus, borealis, lice, are, often, host, specific, and, the, closely, related, common, and, arctic, terns, carry, quite, different, species, internal, parasites, include, the, crustacean, reighardia, sternae, and, tapeworms, such, as, ligula, intestinalis, and, members, of, the, genera, diphyllobothrium, and, schistocephalus, terns, are, normally, free, of, blood, parasites, unlike, gulls, that, often, carry, haemoproteus, species, an, exception, is, the, brown, noddy, which, sometimes, harbours, protozoa, of, that, genus, in, 1961, the, common, tern, was, the, first, wild, bird, species, identified, as, being, infected, with, avian, influenza, the, h5n3, variant, being, found, in, an, outbreak, involving, south, african, birds, several, species, of, terns, have, been, implicated, as, carriers, of, west, nile, virus, terns, and, their, eggs, have, long, been, eaten, by, humans, and, island, colonies, were, raided, by, sailors, on, long, voyages, since, the, eggs, or, large, chicks, were, an, easily, obtained, source, of, protein, eggs, are, still, illegally, harvested, in, southern, europe, and, adults, of, wintering, birds, are, taken, as, food, in, west, africa, and, south, america, the, roseate, tern, is, significantly, affected, by, this, hunting, with, adult, survival, 10, lower, than, would, otherwise, be, expected, in, the, west, indies, the, eggs, of, roseate, and, sooty, terns, are, believed, to, be, aphrodisiacs, and, are, disproportionately, targeted, by, egg, collectors, tern, skins, and, feathers, have, long, been, used, for, making, items, of, clothing, such, as, capes, and, hats, and, this, became, a, large, scale, activity, in, the, second, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, when, it, became, fashionable, to, use, feathers, in, hatmaking, this, trend, started, in, europe, but, soon, spread, to, the, americas, and, australia, white, was, the, preferred, colour, and, sometimes, wings, or, entire, birds, were, used, terns, have, sometimes, benefited, from, human, activities, following, the, plough, or, fishing, boats, for, easy, food, supplies, although, some, birds, get, trapped, in, nets, or, swallow, plastic, fishermen, looked, for, feeding, tern, flocks, since, the, birds, could, lead, them, to, fish, shoals, overfishing, of, small, fish, such, as, sand, eels, can, lead, to, steep, declines, in, the, colonies, relying, on, these, prey, items, more, generally, the, loss, or, disruption, to, tern, colonies, caused, by, human, activities, has, caused, declines, in, many, species, pollution, has, been, a, problem, in, some, areas, and, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, ddt, caused, egg, loss, through, thinning, of, the, shells, in, the, 1980s, organochlorides, caused, severe, declines, in, the, great, lakes, area, of, the, us, because, of, their, sensitivity, to, pollutants, terns, are, sometimes, used, as, indicators, of, contamination, levels, habitat, enhancements, used, to, increase, the, breeding, success, of, terns, include, floating, nest, platforms, for, black, common, and, caspian, terns, and, artificial, islands, created, for, a, number, of, different, species, more, specialised, interventions, include, providing, nest, boxes, for, roseate, terns, which, normally, nest, in, the, shelter, of, tallish, vegetation, and, using, artificial, eelgrass, mats, to, encourage, common, terns, to, nest, in, areas, not, vulnerable, to, flooding, a, number, of, terns, face, serious, threats, and, the, chinese, crested, tern, is, classed, as, critically, endangered, by, birdlife, international, it, has, a, population, of, fewer, than, 50, birds, and, a, breeding, range, of, just, 9, km, 2, 3, 5, sq, mi, it, is, declining, due, to, egg, collection, human, disturbance, and, the, loss, of, coastal, wetlands, in, china, three, other, species, are, categorised, as, endangered, with, declining, populations, of, less, than, 10, 000, birds, the, south, asian, black, bellied, tern, is, threatened, by, habitat, loss, egg, collecting, for, food, pollution, and, predation, in, new, zealand, the, black, fronted, tern, is, facing, a, rapid, fall, in, numbers, due, to, predation, by, introduced, mammals, and, australian, magpies, disturbance, by, cattle, and, sheep, and, by, human, activities, is, also, a, factor, the, peruvian, tern, was, initially, damaged, by, the, collapse, of, anchoveta, stocks, in, 1972, but, breeding, colonies, have, subsequently, been, lost, due, to, building, disturbance, and, pollution, in, their,
