ebola, also, known, as, ebola, virus, disease, evd, and, ebola, hemorrhagic, fever, ehf, is, a, viral, hemorrhagic, fever, in, humans, and, other, primates, caused, by, ebolaviruses, symptoms, typically, start, anywhere, between, two, days, and, three, weeks, after, infection, the, first, symptoms, are, usually, fever, sore, throat, muscle, pain, and, headaches, these, are, usually, followed, by, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, and, decreased, liver, and, kidney, function, at, which, point, some, people, begin, to, bleed, both, internally, and, externally, it, kills, between, 25, and, 90, of, those, infected, about, 50, on, average, death, is, often, due, to, shock, from, fluid, loss, and, typically, occurs, between, six, and, 16, days, after, the, first, symptoms, appear, early, treatment, of, symptoms, increases, the, survival, rate, considerably, compared, to, late, start, an, ebola, vaccine, was, approved, by, the, us, fda, in, december, 2019, the, virus, spreads, through, direct, contact, with, body, fluids, such, as, blood, from, infected, humans, or, other, animals, or, from, contact, with, items, that, have, recently, been, contaminated, with, infected, body, fluids, there, have, been, no, documented, cases, either, in, nature, or, under, laboratory, conditions, of, spread, through, the, air, between, humans, or, other, primates, after, recovering, from, ebola, semen, or, breast, milk, may, continue, to, carry, the, virus, for, anywhere, between, several, weeks, to, several, months, fruit, bats, are, believed, to, be, the, normal, carrier, in, nature, they, are, able, to, spread, the, virus, without, being, affected, by, it, the, symptoms, of, ebola, may, resemble, those, of, several, other, diseases, including, malaria, cholera, typhoid, fever, meningitis, and, other, viral, hemorrhagic, fevers, diagnosis, is, confirmed, by, testing, blood, samples, for, the, presence, of, viral, rna, viral, antibodies, or, the, virus, itself, control, of, outbreaks, requires, coordinated, medical, services, and, community, engagement, including, rapid, detection, contact, tracing, of, those, exposed, quick, access, to, laboratory, services, care, for, those, infected, and, proper, disposal, of, the, dead, through, cremation, or, burial, prevention, measures, involve, wearing, proper, protective, clothing, and, washing, hands, when, in, close, proximity, to, patients, and, while, handling, potentially, infected, bushmeat, as, well, as, thoroughly, cooking, bushmeat, an, ebola, vaccine, was, approved, by, the, us, fda, in, december, 2019, while, there, is, no, approved, treatment, for, ebola, as, of, 2019, two, treatments, atoltivimab, maftivimab, odesivimab, and, ansuvimab, are, associated, with, improved, outcomes, supportive, efforts, also, improve, outcomes, these, include, oral, rehydration, therapy, drinking, slightly, sweetened, and, salty, water, or, giving, intravenous, fluids, and, treating, symptoms, in, october, 2020, atoltivimab, maftivimab, odesivimab, inmazeb, was, approved, for, medical, use, in, the, united, states, to, treat, the, disease, caused, by, zaire, ebolavirus, ebola, was, first, identified, in, 1976, in, two, simultaneous, outbreaks, one, in, nzara, a, town, in, south, sudan, and, the, other, in, yambuku, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, a, village, near, the, ebola, river, for, which, the, disease, was, named, ebola, outbreaks, occur, intermittently, in, tropical, regions, of, sub, saharan, africa, between, 1976, and, 2012, according, to, the, world, health, organization, there, were, 24, outbreaks, of, ebola, resulting, in, a, total, of, 2, 387, cases, and, 1, 590, deaths, the, largest, ebola, outbreak, to, date, was, an, epidemic, in, west, africa, from, december, 2013, to, january, 2016, with, 28, 646, cases, and, 11, 323, deaths, on, 29, march, 2016, it, was, declared, to, no, longer, be, an, emergency, other, outbreaks, in, africa, began, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, in, may, 2017, and, 2018, in, july, 2019, the, world, health, organization, declared, the, congo, ebola, outbreak, a, world, health, emergency, the, length, of, time, between, exposure, to, the, virus, and, the, development, of, symptoms, incubation, period, is, between, 2, and, 21, days, and, usually, between, 4, and, 10, days, however, recent, estimates, based, on, mathematical, models, predict, that, around, 5, of, cases, may, take, longer, than, 21, days, to, develop, symptoms, usually, begin, with, a, sudden, influenza, like, stage, characterised, by, fatigue, fever, weakness, decreased, appetite, muscular, pain, joint, pain, headache, and, sore, throat, the, fever, is, usually, higher, than, 38, 3, c, 101, f, this, is, often, followed, by, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal, pain, and, sometimes, hiccups, the, combination, of, severe, vomiting, and, diarrhoea, often, leads, to, severe, dehydration, next, shortness, of, breath, and, chest, pain, may, occur, along, with, swelling, headaches, and, confusion, in, about, half, of, the, cases, the, skin, may, develop, a, maculopapular, rash, a, flat, red, area, covered, with, small, bumps, five, to, seven, days, after, symptoms, begin, in, some, cases, internal, and, external, bleeding, may, occur, this, typically, begins, five, to, seven, days, after, the, first, symptoms, all, infected, people, show, some, decreased, blood, clotting, bleeding, from, mucous, membranes, or, from, sites, of, needle, punctures, has, been, reported, in, 40, 50, of, cases, this, may, cause, vomiting, blood, coughing, up, of, blood, or, blood, in, stool, bleeding, into, the, skin, may, create, petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses, or, haematomas, especially, around, needle, injection, sites, bleeding, into, the, whites, of, the, eyes, may, also, occur, heavy, bleeding, is, uncommon, if, it, occurs, it, is, usually, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, the, incidence, of, bleeding, into, the, gastrointestinal, tract, was, reported, to, be, 58, in, the, 2001, outbreak, in, gabon, but, in, the, 2014, 15, outbreak, in, the, us, it, was, 18, possibly, due, to, improved, prevention, of, disseminated, intravascular, coagulation, recovery, may, begin, between, seven, and, 14, days, after, first, symptoms, death, if, it, occurs, follows, typically, six, to, sixteen, days, from, first, symptoms, and, is, often, due, to, shock, from, fluid, loss, in, general, bleeding, often, indicates, a, worse, outcome, and, blood, loss, may, result, in, death, people, are, often, in, a, coma, near, the, end, of, life, those, who, survive, often, have, ongoing, muscular, and, joint, pain, liver, inflammation, and, decreased, hearing, and, may, have, continued, tiredness, continued, weakness, decreased, appetite, and, difficulty, returning, to, pre, illness, weight, problems, with, vision, may, develop, it, is, recommended, that, survivors, of, evd, wear, condoms, for, at, least, twelve, months, after, initial, infection, or, until, the, semen, of, a, male, survivor, tests, negative, for, ebola, virus, on, two, separate, occasions, survivors, develop, antibodies, against, ebola, that, last, at, least, 10, years, but, it, is, unclear, whether, they, are, immune, to, additional, infections, evd, in, humans, is, caused, by, four, of, six, viruses, of, the, genus, ebolavirus, the, four, are, bundibugyo, virus, bdbv, sudan, virus, sudv, ta, forest, virus, tafv, and, one, simply, called, ebola, virus, ebov, formerly, zaire, ebola, virus, ebov, species, zaire, ebolavirus, is, the, most, dangerous, of, the, known, evd, causing, viruses, and, is, responsible, for, the, largest, number, of, outbreaks, the, fifth, and, sixth, viruses, reston, virus, restv, and, bombali, virus, bomv, are, not, thought, to, cause, disease, in, humans, but, have, caused, disease, in, other, primates, all, five, viruses, are, closely, related, to, marburgviruses, ebolaviruses, contain, single, stranded, non, infectious, rna, genomes, ebolavirus, genomes, contain, seven, genes, including, 3, utr, np, vp35, vp40, gp, vp30, vp24, l, 5, utr, the, genomes, of, the, five, different, ebolaviruses, bdbv, ebov, restv, sudv, and, tafv, differ, in, sequence, and, the, number, and, location, of, gene, overlaps, as, with, all, filoviruses, ebolavirus, virions, are, filamentous, particles, that, may, appear, in, the, shape, of, a, shepherd, s, crook, of, a, u, or, of, a, 6, and, they, may, be, coiled, toroid, or, branched, in, general, ebolavirions, are, 80, nanometers, nm, in, width, and, may, be, as, long, as, 14, 000, nm, their, life, cycle, is, thought, to, begin, with, a, virion, attaching, to, specific, cell, surface, receptors, such, as, c, type, lectins, dc, sign, or, integrins, which, is, followed, by, fusion, of, the, viral, envelope, with, cellular, membranes, the, virions, taken, up, by, the, cell, then, travel, to, acidic, endosomes, and, lysosomes, where, the, viral, envelope, glycoprotein, gp, is, cleaved, this, processing, appears, to, allow, the, virus, to, bind, to, cellular, proteins, enabling, it, to, fuse, with, internal, cellular, membranes, and, release, the, viral, nucleocapsid, the, ebolavirus, structural, glycoprotein, known, as, gp1, 2, is, responsible, for, the, virus, ability, to, bind, to, and, infect, targeted, cells, the, viral, rna, polymerase, encoded, by, the, l, gene, partially, uncoats, the, nucleocapsid, and, transcribes, the, genes, into, positive, strand, mrnas, which, are, then, translated, into, structural, and, nonstructural, proteins, the, most, abundant, protein, produced, is, the, nucleoprotein, whose, concentration, in, the, host, cell, determines, when, l, switches, from, gene, transcription, to, genome, replication, replication, of, the, viral, genome, results, in, full, length, positive, strand, antigenomes, that, are, in, turn, transcribed, into, genome, copies, of, negative, strand, virus, progeny, newly, synthesised, structural, proteins, and, genomes, self, assemble, and, accumulate, near, the, inside, of, the, cell, membrane, virions, bud, off, from, the, cell, gaining, their, envelopes, from, the, cellular, membrane, from, which, they, bud, the, mature, progeny, particles, then, infect, other, cells, to, repeat, the, cycle, the, genetics, of, the, ebola, virus, are, difficult, to, study, because, of, ebov, s, virulent, characteristics, it, is, believed, that, between, people, ebola, disease, spreads, only, by, direct, contact, with, the, blood, or, other, body, fluids, of, a, person, who, has, developed, symptoms, of, the, disease, body, fluids, that, may, contain, ebola, viruses, include, saliva, mucus, vomit, feces, sweat, tears, breast, milk, urine, and, semen, the, who, states, that, only, people, who, are, very, sick, are, able, to, spread, ebola, disease, in, saliva, and, the, virus, has, not, been, reported, to, be, transmitted, through, sweat, most, people, spread, the, virus, through, blood, feces, and, vomit, entry, points, for, the, virus, include, the, nose, mouth, eyes, open, wounds, cuts, and, abrasions, ebola, may, be, spread, through, large, droplets, however, this, is, believed, to, occur, only, when, a, person, is, very, sick, this, contamination, can, happen, if, a, person, is, splashed, with, droplets, contact, with, surfaces, or, objects, contaminated, by, the, virus, particularly, needles, and, syringes, may, also, transmit, the, infection, the, virus, is, able, to, survive, on, objects, for, a, few, hours, in, a, dried, state, and, can, survive, for, a, few, days, within, body, fluids, outside, of, a, person, the, ebola, virus, may, be, able, to, persist, for, more, than, three, months, in, the, semen, after, recovery, which, could, lead, to, infections, via, sexual, intercourse, virus, persistence, in, semen, for, over, a, year, has, been, recorded, in, a, national, screening, programme, ebola, may, also, occur, in, the, breast, milk, of, women, after, recovery, and, it, is, not, known, when, it, is, safe, to, breastfeed, again, the, virus, was, also, found, in, the, eye, of, one, patient, in, 2014, two, months, after, it, was, cleared, from, his, blood, otherwise, people, who, have, recovered, are, not, infectious, the, potential, for, widespread, infections, in, countries, with, medical, systems, capable, of, observing, correct, medical, isolation, procedures, is, considered, low, usually, when, someone, has, symptoms, of, the, disease, they, are, unable, to, travel, without, assistance, dead, bodies, remain, infectious, thus, people, handling, human, remains, in, practices, such, as, traditional, burial, rituals, or, more, modern, processes, such, as, embalming, are, at, risk, of, the, cases, of, ebola, infections, in, guinea, during, the, 2014, outbreak, 69, are, believed, to, have, been, contracted, via, unprotected, or, unsuitably, protected, contact, with, infected, corpses, during, certain, guinean, burial, rituals, health, care, workers, treating, people, with, ebola, are, at, greatest, risk, of, infection, the, risk, increases, when, they, do, not, have, appropriate, protective, clothing, such, as, masks, gowns, gloves, and, eye, protection, do, not, wear, it, properly, or, handle, contaminated, clothing, incorrectly, this, risk, is, particularly, common, in, parts, of, africa, where, the, disease, mostly, occurs, and, health, systems, function, poorly, there, has, been, transmission, in, hospitals, in, some, african, countries, that, reuse, hypodermic, needles, some, health, care, centres, caring, for, people, with, the, disease, do, not, have, running, water, in, the, united, states, the, spread, to, two, medical, workers, treating, infected, patients, prompted, criticism, of, inadequate, training, and, procedures, human, to, human, transmission, of, ebov, through, the, air, has, not, been, reported, to, occur, during, evd, outbreaks, and, airborne, transmission, has, only, been, demonstrated, in, very, strict, laboratory, conditions, and, then, only, from, pigs, to, primates, but, not, from, primates, to, primates, spread, of, ebov, by, water, or, food, other, than, bushmeat, has, not, been, observed, no, spread, by, mosquitos, or, other, insects, has, been, reported, other, possible, methods, of, transmission, are, being, studied, airborne, transmission, among, humans, is, theoretically, possible, due, to, the, presence, of, ebola, virus, particles, in, saliva, which, can, be, discharged, into, the, air, with, a, cough, or, sneeze, but, observational, data, from, previous, epidemics, suggests, the, actual, risk, of, airborne, transmission, is, low, a, number, of, studies, examining, airborne, transmission, broadly, concluded, that, transmission, from, pigs, to, primates, could, happen, without, direct, contact, because, unlike, humans, and, primates, pigs, with, evd, get, very, high, ebolavirus, concentrations, in, their, lungs, and, not, their, bloodstream, therefore, pigs, with, evd, can, spread, the, disease, through, droplets, in, the, air, or, on, the, ground, when, they, sneeze, or, cough, by, contrast, humans, and, other, primates, accumulate, the, virus, throughout, their, body, and, specifically, in, their, blood, but, not, very, much, in, their, lungs, it, is, believed, that, this, is, the, reason, researchers, have, observed, pig, to, primate, transmission, without, physical, contact, but, no, evidence, has, been, found, of, primates, being, infected, without, actual, contact, even, in, experiments, where, infected, and, uninfected, primates, shared, the, same, air, although, it, is, not, entirely, clear, how, ebola, initially, spreads, from, animals, to, humans, the, spread, is, believed, to, involve, direct, contact, with, an, infected, wild, animal, or, fruit, bat, besides, bats, other, wild, animals, that, are, sometimes, infected, with, ebov, include, several, species, of, monkeys, such, as, baboons, great, apes, chimpanzees, and, gorillas, and, duikers, a, species, of, antelope, animals, may, become, infected, when, they, eat, fruit, partially, eaten, by, bats, carrying, the, virus, fruit, production, animal, behavior, and, other, factors, may, trigger, outbreaks, among, animal, populations, evidence, indicates, that, both, domestic, dogs, and, pigs, can, also, be, infected, with, ebov, dogs, do, not, appear, to, develop, symptoms, when, they, carry, the, virus, and, pigs, appear, to, be, able, to, transmit, the, virus, to, at, least, some, primates, although, some, dogs, in, an, area, in, which, a, human, outbreak, occurred, had, antibodies, to, ebov, it, is, unclear, whether, they, played, a, role, in, spreading, the, disease, to, people, the, natural, reservoir, for, ebola, has, yet, to, be, confirmed, however, bats, are, considered, to, be, the, most, likely, candidate, three, types, of, fruit, bats, hypsignathus, monstrosus, epomops, franqueti, and, myonycteris, torquata, were, found, to, possibly, carry, the, virus, without, getting, sick, as, of, 2013, whether, other, animals, are, involved, in, its, spread, is, not, known, plants, arthropods, rodents, and, birds, have, also, been, considered, possible, viral, reservoirs, bats, were, known, to, roost, in, the, cotton, factory, in, which, the, first, cases, of, the, 1976, and, 1979, outbreaks, were, observed, and, they, have, also, been, implicated, in, marburg, virus, infections, in, 1975, and, 1980, of, 24, plant, and, 19, vertebrate, species, experimentally, inoculated, with, ebov, only, bats, became, infected, the, bats, displayed, no, clinical, signs, of, disease, which, is, considered, evidence, that, these, bats, are, a, reservoir, species, of, ebov, in, a, 2002, 2003, survey, of, 1, 030, animals, including, 679, bats, from, gabon, and, the, republic, of, the, congo, immunoglobulin, g, igg, immune, defense, molecules, indicative, of, ebola, infection, were, found, in, three, bat, species, at, various, periods, of, study, between, 2, 2, and, 22, 6, of, bats, were, found, to, contain, both, rna, sequences, and, igg, molecules, indicating, ebola, infection, antibodies, against, zaire, and, reston, viruses, have, been, found, in, fruit, bats, in, bangladesh, suggesting, that, these, bats, are, also, potential, hosts, of, the, virus, and, that, the, filoviruses, are, present, in, asia, between, 1976, and, 1998, in, 30, 000, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and, arthropods, sampled, from, regions, of, ebov, outbreaks, no, ebola, virus, was, detected, apart, from, some, genetic, traces, found, in, six, rodents, belonging, to, the, species, mus, setulosus, and, praomys, and, one, shrew, sylvisorex, ollula, collected, from, the, central, african, republic, however, further, research, efforts, have, not, confirmed, rodents, as, a, reservoir, traces, of, ebov, were, detected, in, the, carcasses, of, gorillas, and, chimpanzees, during, outbreaks, in, 2001, and, 2003, which, later, became, the, source, of, human, infections, however, the, high, rates, of, death, in, these, species, resulting, from, ebov, infection, make, it, unlikely, that, these, species, represent, a, natural, reservoir, for, the, virus, deforestation, has, been, mentioned, as, a, possible, contributor, to, recent, outbreaks, including, the, west, african, ebola, virus, epidemic, index, cases, of, evd, have, often, been, close, to, recently, deforested, lands, like, other, filoviruses, ebov, replicates, very, efficiently, in, many, cells, producing, large, amounts, of, virus, in, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic, cells, and, other, cells, including, liver, cells, fibroblasts, and, adrenal, gland, cells, viral, replication, triggers, high, levels, of, inflammatory, chemical, signals, and, leads, to, a, septic, state, ebov, is, thought, to, infect, humans, through, contact, with, mucous, membranes, or, skin, breaks, after, infection, endothelial, cells, cells, lining, the, inside, of, blood, vessels, liver, cells, and, several, types, of, immune, cells, such, as, macrophages, monocytes, and, dendritic, cells, are, the, main, targets, of, attack, following, infection, immune, cells, carry, the, virus, to, nearby, lymph, nodes, where, further, reproduction, of, the, virus, takes, place, from, there, the, virus, can, enter, the, bloodstream, and, lymphatic, system, and, spread, throughout, the, body, macrophages, are, the, first, cells, infected, with, the, virus, and, this, infection, results, in, programmed, cell, death, other, types, of, white, blood, cells, such, as, lymphocytes, also, undergo, programmed, cell, death, leading, to, an, abnormally, low, concentration, of, lymphocytes, in, the, blood, this, contributes, to, the, weakened, immune, response, seen, in, those, infected, with, ebov, endothelial, cells, may, be, infected, within, three, days, after, exposure, to, the, virus, the, breakdown, of, endothelial, cells, leading, to, blood, vessel, injury, can, be, attributed, to, ebov, glycoproteins, this, damage, occurs, due, to, the, synthesis, of, ebola, virus, glycoprotein, gp, which, reduces, the, availability, of, specific, integrins, responsible, for, cell, adhesion, to, the, intercellular, structure, and, causes, liver, damage, leading, to, improper, clotting, the, widespread, bleeding, that, occurs, in, affected, people, causes, swelling, and, shock, due, to, loss, of, blood, volume, the, dysfunctional, bleeding, and, clotting, commonly, seen, in, evd, has, been, attributed, to, increased, activation, of, the, extrinsic, pathway, of, the, coagulation, cascade, due, to, excessive, tissue, factor, production, by, macrophages, and, monocytes, after, infection, a, secreted, glycoprotein, small, soluble, glycoprotein, sgp, or, gp, is, synthesised, ebov, replication, overwhelms, protein, synthesis, of, infected, cells, and, the, host, immune, defences, the, gp, forms, a, trimeric, complex, which, tethers, the, virus, to, the, endothelial, cells, the, sgp, forms, a, dimeric, protein, that, interferes, with, the, signalling, of, neutrophils, another, type, of, white, blood, cell, this, enables, the, virus, to, evade, the, immune, system, by, inhibiting, early, steps, of, neutrophil, activation, furthermore, the, virus, is, capable, of, hijacking, cellular, metabolism, studies, have, shown, that, ebola, virus, like, particles, can, reprogram, metabolism, in, both, vascular, and, immune, cells, filoviral, infection, also, interferes, with, proper, functioning, of, the, innate, immune, system, ebov, proteins, blunt, the, human, immune, system, s, response, to, viral, infections, by, interfering, with, the, cells, ability, to, produce, and, respond, to, interferon, proteins, such, as, interferon, alpha, interferon, beta, and, interferon, gamma, the, vp24, and, vp35, structural, proteins, of, ebov, play, a, key, role, in, this, interference, when, a, cell, is, infected, with, ebov, receptors, located, in, the, cell, s, cytosol, such, as, rig, i, and, mda5, or, outside, of, the, cytosol, such, as, toll, like, receptor, 3, tlr3, tlr7, tlr8, and, tlr9, recognise, infectious, molecules, associated, with, the, virus, on, tlr, activation, proteins, including, interferon, regulatory, factor, 3, and, interferon, regulatory, factor, 7, trigger, a, signalling, cascade, that, leads, to, the, expression, of, type, 1, interferons, the, type, 1, interferons, are, then, released, and, bind, to, the, ifnar1, and, ifnar2, receptors, expressed, on, the, surface, of, a, neighbouring, cell, once, interferon, has, bound, to, its, receptors, on, the, neighbouring, cell, the, signalling, proteins, stat1, and, stat2, are, activated, and, move, to, the, cell, s, nucleus, this, triggers, the, expression, of, interferon, stimulated, genes, which, code, for, proteins, with, antiviral, properties, ebov, s, v24, protein, blocks, the, production, of, these, antiviral, proteins, by, preventing, the, stat1, signalling, protein, in, the, neighbouring, cell, from, entering, the, nucleus, the, vp35, protein, directly, inhibits, the, production, of, interferon, beta, by, inhibiting, these, immune, responses, ebov, may, quickly, spread, throughout, the, body, when, evd, is, suspected, travel, work, history, and, exposure, to, wildlife, are, important, factors, with, respect, to, further, diagnostic, efforts, possible, non, specific, laboratory, indicators, of, evd, include, a, low, platelet, count, an, initially, decreased, white, blood, cell, count, followed, by, an, increased, white, blood, cell, count, elevated, levels, of, the, liver, enzymes, alanine, aminotransferase, alt, and, aspartate, aminotransferase, ast, and, abnormalities, in, blood, clotting, often, consistent, with, disseminated, intravascular, coagulation, dic, such, as, a, prolonged, prothrombin, time, partial, thromboplastin, time, and, bleeding, time, filovirions, such, as, ebov, may, be, identified, by, their, unique, filamentous, shapes, in, cell, cultures, examined, with, electron, microscopy, the, specific, diagnosis, of, evd, is, confirmed, by, isolating, the, virus, detecting, its, rna, or, proteins, or, detecting, antibodies, against, the, virus, in, a, person, s, blood, isolating, the, virus, by, cell, culture, detecting, the, viral, rna, by, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, and, detecting, proteins, by, enzyme, linked, immunosorbent, assay, elisa, are, methods, best, used, in, the, early, stages, of, the, disease, and, also, for, detecting, the, virus, in, human, remains, detecting, antibodies, against, the, virus, is, most, reliable, in, the, later, stages, of, the, disease, and, in, those, who, recover, igm, antibodies, are, detectable, two, days, after, symptom, onset, and, igg, antibodies, can, be, detected, six, to, 18, days, after, symptom, onset, during, an, outbreak, isolation, of, the, virus, with, cell, culture, methods, is, often, not, feasible, in, field, or, mobile, hospitals, the, most, common, and, sensitive, diagnostic, methods, are, real, time, pcr, and, elisa, in, 2014, with, new, mobile, testing, facilities, deployed, in, parts, of, liberia, test, results, were, obtained, 3, 5, hours, after, sample, submission, in, 2015, a, rapid, antigen, test, which, gives, results, in, 15, minutes, was, approved, for, use, by, who, it, is, able, to, confirm, ebola, in, 92, of, those, affected, and, rule, it, out, in, 85, of, those, not, affected, early, symptoms, of, evd, may, be, similar, to, those, of, other, diseases, common, in, africa, including, malaria, and, dengue, fever, the, symptoms, are, also, similar, to, those, of, other, viral, haemorrhagic, fevers, such, as, marburg, virus, disease, crimean, congo, haemorrhagic, fever, and, lassa, fever, the, complete, differential, diagnosis, is, extensive, and, requires, consideration, of, many, other, infectious, diseases, such, as, typhoid, fever, shigellosis, rickettsial, diseases, cholera, sepsis, borreliosis, ehec, enteritis, leptospirosis, scrub, typhus, plague, q, fever, candidiasis, histoplasmosis, trypanosomiasis, visceral, leishmaniasis, measles, and, viral, hepatitis, among, others, non, infectious, diseases, that, may, result, in, symptoms, similar, to, those, of, evd, include, acute, promyelocytic, leukaemia, haemolytic, uraemic, syndrome, snake, envenomation, clotting, factor, deficiencies, platelet, disorders, thrombotic, thrombocytopenic, purpura, hereditary, haemorrhagic, telangiectasia, kawasaki, disease, and, warfarin, poisoning, an, ebola, vaccine, rvsv, zebov, was, approved, in, the, united, states, in, december, 2019, it, appears, to, be, fully, effective, ten, days, after, being, given, it, was, studied, in, guinea, between, 2014, and, 2016, more, than, 100, 000, people, have, been, vaccinated, against, ebola, as, of, 2019, the, who, reported, that, approximately, 345, 000, people, were, given, the, vaccine, during, the, kivu, ebola, epidemic, from, 2018, to, 2020, community, awareness, of, the, benefits, on, survival, chances, of, admitting, cases, early, is, important, for, the, infected, and, infection, control, people, who, care, for, those, infected, with, ebola, should, wear, protective, clothing, including, masks, gloves, gowns, and, goggles, the, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, cdc, recommend, that, the, protective, gear, leaves, no, skin, exposed, these, measures, are, also, recommended, for, those, who, may, handle, objects, contaminated, by, an, infected, person, s, body, fluids, in, 2014, the, cdc, began, recommending, that, medical, personnel, receive, training, on, the, proper, suit, up, and, removal, of, personal, protective, equipment, ppe, in, addition, a, designated, person, appropriately, trained, in, biosafety, should, be, watching, each, step, of, these, procedures, to, ensure, they, are, done, correctly, in, sierra, leone, the, typical, training, period, for, the, use, of, such, safety, equipment, lasts, approximately, 12, days, in, 2022, in, uganda, lighter, personal, protection, equipment, has, become, available, as, well, as, possibilities, to, monitor, and, communicate, with, patients, from, windows, in, the, treatment, tents, until, it, is, necessary, to, enter, if, e, g, a, patient, s, oxygen, levels, drop, the, infected, person, should, be, in, barrier, isolation, from, other, people, all, equipment, medical, waste, patient, waste, and, surfaces, that, may, have, come, into, contact, with, body, fluids, need, to, be, disinfected, during, the, 2014, outbreak, kits, were, put, together, to, help, families, treat, ebola, disease, in, their, homes, which, included, protective, clothing, as, well, as, chlorine, powder, and, other, cleaning, supplies, education, of, caregivers, in, these, techniques, and, providing, such, barrier, separation, supplies, has, been, a, priority, of, doctors, without, borders, ebolaviruses, can, be, eliminated, with, heat, heating, for, 30, to, 60, minutes, at, 60, c, or, boiling, for, five, minutes, to, disinfect, surfaces, some, lipid, solvents, such, as, some, alcohol, based, products, detergents, sodium, hypochlorite, bleach, or, calcium, hypochlorite, bleaching, powder, and, other, suitable, disinfectants, may, be, used, at, appropriate, concentrations, education, of, the, general, public, about, the, risk, factors, for, ebola, infection, and, of, the, protective, measures, individuals, may, take, to, prevent, infection, is, recommended, by, the, world, health, organization, these, measures, include, avoiding, direct, contact, with, infected, people, and, regular, hand, washing, using, soap, and, water, bushmeat, an, important, source, of, protein, in, the, diet, of, some, africans, should, be, handled, and, prepared, with, appropriate, protective, clothing, and, thoroughly, cooked, before, consumption, some, research, suggests, that, an, outbreak, of, ebola, disease, in, the, wild, animals, used, for, consumption, may, result, in, a, corresponding, human, outbreak, since, 2003, such, animal, outbreaks, have, been, monitored, to, predict, and, prevent, ebola, outbreaks, in, humans, if, a, person, with, ebola, disease, dies, direct, contact, with, the, body, should, be, avoided, certain, burial, rituals, which, may, have, included, making, various, direct, contacts, with, a, dead, body, require, reformulation, so, that, they, consistently, maintain, a, proper, protective, barrier, between, the, dead, body, and, the, living, social, anthropologists, may, help, find, alternatives, to, traditional, rules, for, burials, transportation, crews, are, instructed, to, follow, a, certain, isolation, procedure, should, anyone, exhibit, symptoms, resembling, evd, as, of, august, 2014, the, who, does, not, consider, travel, bans, to, be, useful, in, decreasing, spread, of, the, disease, in, october, 2014, the, cdc, defined, four, risk, levels, used, to, determine, the, level, of, 21, day, monitoring, for, symptoms, and, restrictions, on, public, activities, in, the, united, states, the, cdc, recommends, that, restrictions, on, public, activity, including, travel, restrictions, are, not, required, for, the, following, defined, risk, levels, the, cdc, recommends, monitoring, for, the, symptoms, of, ebola, disease, for, those, both, at, low, risk, and, at, higher, risk, in, laboratories, where, diagnostic, testing, is, carried, out, biosafety, level, 4, equivalent, containment, is, required, laboratory, researchers, must, be, properly, trained, in, bsl, 4, practices, and, wear, proper, ppe, isolation, refers, to, separating, those, who, are, sick, from, those, who, are, not, quarantine, refers, to, separating, those, who, may, have, been, exposed, to, a, disease, until, they, either, show, signs, of, the, disease, or, are, no, longer, at, risk, quarantine, also, known, as, enforced, isolation, is, usually, effective, in, decreasing, spread, governments, often, quarantine, areas, where, the, disease, is, occurring, or, individuals, who, may, transmit, the, disease, outside, of, an, initial, area, in, the, united, states, the, law, allows, quarantine, of, those, infected, with, ebolaviruses, contact, tracing, is, considered, important, to, contain, an, outbreak, it, involves, finding, everyone, who, had, close, contact, with, infected, individuals, and, monitoring, them, for, signs, of, illness, for, 21, days, if, any, of, these, contacts, comes, down, with, the, disease, they, should, be, isolated, tested, and, treated, then, the, process, is, repeated, tracing, the, contacts, contacts, as, of, 2019, two, treatments, atoltivimab, maftivimab, odesivimab, and, ansuvimab, are, associated, with, improved, outcomes, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, advises, people, to, be, careful, of, advertisements, making, unverified, or, fraudulent, claims, of, benefits, supposedly, gained, from, various, anti, ebola, products, in, october, 2020, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, approved, atoltivimab, maftivimab, odesivimab, with, an, indication, for, the, treatment, of, infection, caused, by, zaire, ebolavirus, treatment, is, primarily, supportive, in, nature, early, supportive, care, with, rehydration, and, symptomatic, treatment, improves, survival, rehydration, may, be, via, the, oral, or, intravenous, route, these, measures, may, include, pain, management, and, treatment, for, nausea, fever, and, anxiety, the, world, health, organization, who, recommends, avoiding, aspirin, or, ibuprofen, for, pain, management, due, to, the, risk, of, bleeding, associated, with, these, medications, blood, products, such, as, packed, red, blood, cells, platelets, or, fresh, frozen, plasma, may, also, be, used, other, regulators, of, coagulation, have, also, been, tried, including, heparin, in, an, effort, to, prevent, disseminated, intravascular, coagulation, and, clotting, factors, to, decrease, bleeding, antimalarial, medications, and, antibiotics, are, often, used, before, the, diagnosis, is, confirmed, though, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, such, treatment, helps, several, experimental, treatments, are, being, studied, where, hospital, care, is, not, possible, the, who, s, guidelines, for, home, care, have, been, relatively, successful, recommendations, include, using, towels, soaked, in, a, bleach, solution, when, moving, infected, people, or, bodies, and, also, applying, bleach, on, stains, it, is, also, recommended, that, the, caregivers, wash, hands, with, bleach, solutions, and, cover, their, mouth, and, nose, with, a, cloth, intensive, care, is, often, used, in, the, developed, world, this, may, include, maintaining, blood, volume, and, electrolytes, salts, balance, as, well, as, treating, any, bacterial, infections, that, may, develop, dialysis, may, be, needed, for, kidney, failure, and, extracorporeal, membrane, oxygenation, may, be, used, for, lung, dysfunction, evd, has, a, risk, of, death, in, those, infected, of, between, 25, and, 90, as, of, september, 2014, the, average, risk, of, death, among, those, infected, is, 50, the, highest, risk, of, death, was, 90, in, the, 2002, 2003, republic, of, the, congo, outbreak, early, admission, significantly, increases, survival, rates, death, if, it, occurs, follows, typically, six, to, sixteen, days, after, symptoms, appear, and, is, often, due, to, low, blood, pressure, from, fluid, loss, early, supportive, care, to, prevent, dehydration, may, reduce, the, risk, of, death, if, an, infected, person, survives, recovery, may, be, quick, and, complete, however, a, large, portion, of, survivors, develop, post, ebola, virus, syndrome, after, the, acute, phase, of, the, infection, prolonged, cases, are, often, complicated, by, the, occurrence, of, long, term, problems, such, as, inflammation, of, the, testicles, joint, pains, fatigue, hearing, loss, mood, and, sleep, disturbances, muscular, pain, abdominal, pain, menstrual, abnormalities, miscarriages, skin, peeling, or, hair, loss, inflammation, and, swelling, of, the, uveal, layer, of, the, eye, is, the, most, common, eye, complication, in, survivors, of, ebola, virus, disease, eye, symptoms, such, as, light, sensitivity, excess, tearing, and, vision, loss, have, been, described, ebola, can, stay, in, some, body, parts, like, the, eyes, breasts, and, testicles, after, infection, sexual, transmission, after, recovery, has, been, suspected, if, sexual, transmission, occurs, following, recovery, it, is, believed, to, be, a, rare, event, one, case, of, a, condition, similar, to, meningitis, has, been, reported, many, months, after, recovery, as, of, october, 2015, the, disease, typically, occurs, in, outbreaks, in, tropical, regions, of, sub, saharan, africa, from, 1976, when, it, was, first, identified, through, 2013, the, who, reported, 2, 387, confirmed, cases, with, 1, 590, overall, fatalities, the, largest, outbreak, to, date, was, the, ebola, virus, epidemic, in, west, africa, which, caused, a, large, number, of, deaths, in, guinea, sierra, leone, and, liberia, the, first, known, outbreak, of, evd, was, identified, only, after, the, fact, it, occurred, between, june, and, november, 1976, in, nzara, south, sudan, then, part, of, sudan, and, was, caused, by, sudan, virus, sudv, the, sudan, outbreak, infected, 284, people, and, killed, 151, the, first, identifiable, case, in, sudan, occurred, on, 27, june, in, a, storekeeper, in, a, cotton, factory, in, nzara, who, was, hospitalised, on, 30, june, and, died, on, 6, july, although, the, who, medical, staff, involved, in, the, sudan, outbreak, knew, that, they, were, dealing, with, a, heretofore, unknown, disease, the, actual, positive, identification, process, and, the, naming, of, the, virus, did, not, occur, until, some, months, later, in, zaire, on, 26, august, 1976, the, second, outbreak, of, evd, began, in, yambuku, a, small, rural, village, in, mongala, district, in, northern, zaire, now, known, as, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, this, outbreak, was, caused, by, ebov, formerly, designated, zaire, ebolavirus, a, different, member, of, the, genus, ebolavirus, than, in, the, first, sudan, outbreak, the, first, person, infected, with, the, disease, was, the, village, school, s, headmaster, mabalo, lokela, who, began, displaying, symptoms, on, 26, august, 1976, lokela, had, returned, from, a, trip, to, northern, zaire, near, the, border, of, the, central, african, republic, after, visiting, the, ebola, river, between, 12, and, 22, august, he, was, originally, believed, to, have, malaria, and, was, given, quinine, however, his, symptoms, continued, to, worsen, and, he, was, admitted, to, yambuku, mission, hospital, on, 5, september, lokela, died, on, 8, september, 14, days, after, he, began, displaying, symptoms, soon, after, lokela, s, death, others, who, had, been, in, contact, with, him, also, died, and, people, in, yambuku, began, to, panic, the, country, s, minister, of, health, and, zaire, president, mobutu, sese, seko, declared, the, entire, region, including, yambuku, and, the, country, s, capital, kinshasa, a, quarantine, zone, no, one, was, permitted, to, enter, or, leave, the, area, and, roads, waterways, and, airfields, were, placed, under, martial, law, schools, businesses, and, social, organisations, were, closed, the, initial, response, was, led, by, congolese, doctors, including, jean, jacques, muyembe, tamfum, one, of, the, discoverers, of, ebola, muyembe, took, a, blood, sample, from, a, belgian, nun, this, sample, would, eventually, be, used, by, peter, piot, to, identify, the, previously, unknown, ebola, virus, muyembe, was, also, the, first, scientist, to, come, into, direct, contact, with, the, disease, and, survive, researchers, from, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, including, piot, co, discoverer, of, ebola, later, arrived, to, assess, the, effects, of, the, outbreak, observing, that, the, whole, region, was, in, panic, piot, concluded, that, belgian, nuns, had, inadvertently, started, the, epidemic, by, giving, unnecessary, vitamin, injections, to, pregnant, women, without, sterilizing, the, syringes, and, needles, the, outbreak, lasted, 26, days, and, the, quarantine, lasted, two, weeks, researchers, speculated, that, the, disease, disappeared, due, to, the, precautions, taken, by, locals, the, quarantine, of, the, area, and, discontinuing, of, the, injections, during, this, outbreak, ngoy, mushola, recorded, the, first, clinical, description, of, evd, in, yambuku, where, he, wrote, the, following, in, his, daily, log, the, illness, is, characterised, with, a, high, temperature, of, about, 39, c, 102, f, haematemesis, diarrhoea, with, blood, retrosternal, abdominal, pain, prostration, with, heavy, articulations, and, rapid, evolution, death, after, a, mean, of, three, days, the, virus, responsible, for, the, initial, outbreak, first, thought, to, be, the, marburg, virus, was, later, identified, as, a, new, type, of, virus, related, to, the, genus, marburgvirus, virus, strain, samples, isolated, from, both, outbreaks, were, named, ebola, virus, after, the, ebola, river, near, the, first, identified, viral, outbreak, site, in, zaire, reports, conflict, about, who, initially, coined, the, name, either, karl, johnson, of, the, american, cdc, team, or, belgian, researchers, subsequently, a, number, of, other, cases, were, reported, almost, all, centred, on, the, yambuku, mission, hospital, or, close, contacts, of, another, case, in, all, 318, cases, and, 280, deaths, an, 88, fatality, rate, occurred, in, zaire, although, the, two, outbreaks, were, at, first, believed, connected, scientists, later, realised, that, they, were, caused, by, two, distinct, ebolaviruses, sudv, and, ebov, the, second, major, outbreak, occurred, in, zaire, now, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, drc, in, 1995, affecting, 315, and, killing, 254, in, 2000, uganda, had, an, outbreak, infecting, 425, and, killing, 224, in, this, case, the, sudan, virus, was, found, to, be, the, ebola, species, responsible, for, the, outbreak, in, 2003, an, outbreak, in, the, drc, infected, 143, and, killed, 128, a, 90, death, rate, the, highest, of, a, genus, ebolavirus, outbreak, to, date, in, 2004, a, russian, scientist, died, from, ebola, after, sticking, herself, with, an, infected, needle, between, april, and, august, 2007, a, fever, epidemic, in, a, four, village, region, of, the, drc, was, confirmed, in, september, to, have, been, cases, of, ebola, many, people, who, attended, the, recent, funeral, of, a, local, village, chief, died, the, 2007, outbreak, eventually, infected, 264, individuals, and, killed, 187, on, 30, november, 2007, the, uganda, ministry, of, health, confirmed, an, outbreak, of, ebola, in, the, bundibugyo, district, in, western, uganda, after, confirming, samples, tested, by, the, united, states, national, reference, laboratories, and, the, centers, for, disease, control, the, world, health, organization, who, confirmed, the, presence, of, a, new, species, of, genus, ebolavirus, which, was, tentatively, named, bundibugyo, the, who, reported, 149, cases, of, this, new, strain, and, 37, of, those, led, to, deaths, the, who, confirmed, two, small, outbreaks, in, uganda, in, 2012, both, caused, by, the, sudan, variant, the, first, outbreak, affected, seven, people, killing, four, and, the, second, affected, 24, killing, 17, on, 17, august, 2012, the, ministry, of, health, of, the, drc, reported, an, outbreak, of, the, ebola, bundibugyo, variant, in, the, eastern, region, other, than, its, discovery, in, 2007, this, was, the, only, time, that, this, variant, has, been, identified, as, responsible, for, an, outbreak, the, who, revealed, that, the, virus, had, sickened, 57, people, and, killed, 29, the, probable, cause, of, the, outbreak, was, tainted, bush, meat, hunted, by, local, villagers, around, the, towns, of, isiro, and, viadana, in, 2014, an, outbreak, occurred, in, the, drc, genome, sequencing, showed, that, this, outbreak, was, not, related, to, the, 2014, 15, west, africa, ebola, virus, outbreak, but, was, the, same, ebov, species, the, zaire, species, it, began, in, august, 2014, and, was, declared, over, in, november, with, 66, cases, and, 49, deaths, this, was, the, 7th, outbreak, in, the, drc, three, of, which, occurred, during, the, period, when, the, country, was, known, as, zaire, in, march, 2014, the, world, health, organization, who, reported, a, major, ebola, outbreak, in, guinea, a, west, african, nation, researchers, traced, the, outbreak, to, a, one, year, old, child, who, died, in, december, 2013, the, disease, rapidly, spread, to, the, neighbouring, countries, of, liberia, and, sierra, leone, it, was, the, largest, ebola, outbreak, ever, documented, and, the, first, recorded, in, the, region, on, 8, august, 2014, the, who, declared, the, epidemic, an, international, public, health, emergency, urging, the, world, to, offer, aid, to, the, affected, regions, its, director, general, said, countries, affected, to, date, simply, do, not, have, the, capacity, to, manage, an, outbreak, of, this, size, and, complexity, on, their, own, i, urge, the, international, community, to, provide, this, support, on, the, most, urgent, basis, possible, by, mid, august, 2014, doctors, without, borders, reported, the, situation, in, liberia, s, capital, monrovia, was, catastrophic, and, deteriorating, daily, they, reported, that, fears, of, ebola, among, staff, members, and, patients, had, shut, down, much, of, the, city, s, health, system, leaving, many, people, without, medical, treatment, for, other, conditions, in, a, 26, september, statement, who, said, the, ebola, epidemic, ravaging, parts, of, west, africa, is, the, most, severe, acute, public, health, emergency, seen, in, modern, times, never, before, in, recorded, history, has, a, biosafety, level, four, pathogen, infected, so, many, people, so, quickly, over, such, a, broad, geographical, area, for, so, long, intense, contact, tracing, and, strict, isolation, largely, prevented, further, spread, of, the, disease, in, the, countries, that, had, imported, cases, it, caused, significant, mortality, with, a, considerable, case, fatality, rate, by, the, end, of, the, epidemic, 28, 616, people, had, been, infected, of, these, 11, 310, had, died, for, a, case, fatality, rate, of, 40, as, of, 8, may, 2016, 28, 646, suspected, cases, and, 11, 323, deaths, were, reported, however, the, who, said, that, these, numbers, may, be, underestimated, because, they, work, closely, with, the, body, fluids, of, infected, patients, healthcare, workers, were, especially, vulnerable, to, infection, in, august, 2014, the, who, reported, that, 10, of, the, dead, were, healthcare, workers, in, september, 2014, it, was, estimated, that, the, countries, capacity, for, treating, ebola, patients, was, insufficient, by, the, equivalent, of, 2, 122, beds, by, december, there, were, a, sufficient, number, of, beds, to, treat, and, isolate, all, reported, ebola, cases, although, the, uneven, distribution, of, cases, was, causing, serious, shortfalls, in, some, areas, on, 28, january, 2015, the, who, reported, that, for, the, first, time, since, the, week, ending, 29, june, 2014, there, had, been, fewer, than, 100, new, confirmed, cases, reported, in, a, week, in, the, three, most, affected, countries, the, response, to, the, epidemic, then, moved, to, a, second, phase, as, the, focus, shifted, from, slowing, transmission, to, ending, the, epidemic, on, 8, april, 2015, the, who, reported, only, 30, confirmed, cases, the, lowest, weekly, total, since, the, third, week, of, may, 2014, on, 29, december, 2015, 42, days, after, the, last, person, tested, negative, for, a, second, time, guinea, was, declared, free, of, ebola, transmission, at, that, time, a, 90, day, period, of, heightened, surveillance, was, announced, by, that, agency, this, is, the, first, time, that, all, three, countries, guinea, liberia, and, sierra, leone, have, stopped, the, original, chains, of, transmission, the, organisation, stated, in, a, news, release, a, new, case, was, detected, in, sierra, leone, on, 14, january, 2016, however, the, outbreak, was, declared, no, longer, an, emergency, on, 29, march, 2016, on, 19, september, eric, duncan, flew, from, his, native, liberia, to, texas, five, days, later, he, began, showing, symptoms, and, visited, a, hospital, but, was, sent, home, his, condition, worsened, and, he, returned, to, the, hospital, on, 28, september, where, he, died, on, 8, october, health, officials, confirmed, a, diagnosis, of, ebola, on, 30, september, the, first, case, in, the, united, states, in, early, october, teresa, romero, a, 44, year, old, spanish, nurse, contracted, ebola, after, caring, for, a, priest, who, had, been, repatriated, from, west, africa, this, was, the, first, transmission, of, the, virus, to, occur, outside, africa, romero, tested, negative, for, the, disease, on, 20, october, suggesting, that, she, may, have, recovered, from, ebola, infection, on, 12, october, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, confirmed, that, a, nurse, in, texas, nina, pham, who, had, treated, duncan, tested, positive, for, the, ebola, virus, the, first, known, case, of, transmission, in, the, united, states, on, 15, october, a, second, texas, health, care, worker, who, had, treated, duncan, was, confirmed, to, have, the, virus, both, of, these, people, recovered, an, unrelated, case, involved, a, doctor, in, new, york, city, who, returned, to, the, united, states, from, guinea, after, working, with, m, decins, sans, fronti, res, and, tested, positive, for, ebola, on, 23, october, the, person, recovered, and, was, discharged, from, bellevue, hospital, on, 11, november, on, 24, december, 2014, a, laboratory, in, atlanta, georgia, reported, that, a, technician,

province, including, in, the, large, city, of, mbandaka, the, drc, ministry, of, public, health, approved, the, use, of, an, experimental, vaccine, on, 13, may, 2018, who, director, general, tedros, adhanom, ghebreyesus, visited, bikoro, reports, emerged, that, maps, of, the, area, were, inaccurate, not, so, much, hampering, medical, providers, as, epidemiologists, and, officials, trying, to, assess, the, outbreak, and, containment, efforts, the, 2018, outbreak, in, the, drc, was, declared, over, on, 24, july, 2018, on, 1, august, 2018, the, world, s, 10th, ebola, outbreak, was, declared, in, north, kivu, province, of, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, it, was, the, first, ebola, outbreak, in, a, military, conflict, zone, with, thousands, of, refugees, in, the, area, by, november, 2018, nearly, 200, congolese, had, died, of, ebola, about, half, of, them, from, the, city, of, beni, where, armed, groups, are, fighting, over, the, region, s, mineral, wealth, impeding, medical, relief, efforts, by, march, 2019, this, became, the, second, largest, ebola, outbreak, ever, recorded, with, more, than, 1, 000, cases, and, insecurity, continuing, to, be, the, major, resistance, to, providing, an, adequate, response, as, of, 4, june, 2019, the, who, reported, 2025, confirmed, and, probable, cases, with, 1357, deaths, in, june, 2019, two, people, died, of, ebola,

outbreak, a, global, health, emergency, the, fifth, time, such, a, declaration, has, been, made, by, the, organisation, a, government, spokesman, said, that, half, of, the, ebola, cases, are, unidentified, and, he, added, that, the, current, outbreak, could, last, up, to, three, years, on, 25, june, 2020, the, second, biggest, evd, outbreak, ever, was, declared, over, on, 1, june, 2020, the, congolese, health, ministry, announced, a, new, drc, outbreak, of, ebola, in, mbandaka, quateur, province, a, region, along, the, congo, river, genome, sequencing, suggests, that, this, outbreak, the, 11th, outbreak, since, the, virus, was, first, discovered, in, the, country, in, 1976, is, unrelated, to, the, one, in, north, kivu, province, or, the, previous, outbreak, in, the, same, area, in, 2018, it, was, reported, that, six, cases, had, been, identified, four, of, the, people, had, died, it, is, expected, that, more, people, will, be, identified, as, surveillance, activities, increase, by, 15, june, the, case, count, had, increased, to, 17, with, 11, deaths, with, more, than, 2, 500, people, having, been, vaccinated, the, 11th, evd, outbreak, was, officially, declared, over, on, 19, november, 2020, by, the, time, the, quateur, outbreak, ended, it, had, 130, confirmed, cases, with, 75, recoveries, and, 55, deaths, on, 7, february, 2021, the, congolese, health, ministry, announced, a, new, case, of, ebola, near, butembo, north, kivu, detected, a, day, before, the, case, was, a, 42, year, old, woman, who, had, symptoms, of, ebola, in, biena, on, 1, february,

on, 3, may, 2021, the, 12th, evd, outbreak, was, declared, over, resulting, in, 12, cases, and, six, deaths, heightened, surveillance, will, continue, for, 90, days, after, the, declaration, in, case, of, resurgence, in, february, 2021, sakoba, keita, head, of, guinea, s, national, health, agency, confirmed, that, three, people, had, died, of, ebola, in, the, south, eastern, region, near, the, city, of, nz, r, kor, a, further, five, people, also, tested, positive, keita, also, confirmed, more, testing, was, underway, and, attempts, to, trace, and, isolate, further, cases, had, begun, on, 14, february, the, guinean, government, declared, an, ebola, epidemic, the, outbreak, may, have, started, following, reactivation, of, a, latent, case, in, a, survivor, of, an, earlier, outbreak, as, of, 4, may, 2021, 23, cases, were, reported, with, no, new, cases, or, deaths, since, 3, april, 2021, a, 42, day, countdown, period, was, started, on, 8, may, 2021, and, on, 19, june, the, outbreak, was, declared, over, on, 14, august, 2021, the, ministry, of, health, of, cote, d, ivoire, confirmed, the, country, s, first, case, of, ebola, since, 1994, this, came, after, the, institut, pasteur, in, cote, d, ivoire, confirmed, the, ebola, virus, disease, in, samples, collected, from, a, patient, who, was, hospitalized, in, the, commercial, capital, of, abidjan, after, arriving, from, guinea, however, on, 31, august, 2021, the, who, found, that, after, further, tests, in, a, laboratory, in, lyon, the, patient, did, not, have, ebola, the, cause, of, her, disease, is, still, being, analyzed, on, 23, april, 2022, a, case, of, ebola, was, confirmed, in, the, drc, in, the, equateur, province, the, case, was, a, 31, year, old, man, whose, symptoms, began, on, 5, april, but, did, not, seek, treatment, for, over, a, week, on, 21, april, he, was, admitted, to, an, ebola, treatment, centre, and, died, later, that, day, by, 24, may, 2022, there, were, 5, recorded, deaths, in, the, drc, on, 15, august, the, fifth, case, was, buried, and, the, outbreak, was, declared, over, 42, days, after, on, 4, july, 2022, in, september, 2022, uganda, reported, 7, cases, infected, with, the, ebola, sudan, strain, but, by, mid, october, the, count, had, increased, to, 63, in, november, 2022, the, outbreak, in, uganda, continued, still, without, a, vaccine, on, 10, january, 2023, the, outbreak, was, considered, over, after, no, new, cases, had, been, reported, for, 42, days, the, outbreak, killed, nearly, 80, people, ebolavirus, is, classified, as, a, biosafety, level, 4, agent, as, well, as, a, category, a, bioterrorism, agent, by, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, it, has, the, potential, to, be, weaponised, for, use, in, biological, warfare, and, was, investigated, by, biopreparat, for, such, use, but, might, be, difficult, to, prepare, as, a, weapon, of, mass, destruction, because, the, virus, becomes, ineffective, quickly, in, open, air, fake, emails, pretending, to, be, ebola, information, from, the, who, or, the, mexican, government, have, in, 2014, been, misused, to, spread, computer, malware, the, bbc, reported, in, 2015, that, north, korean, state, media, has, suggested, the, disease, was, created, by, the, u, s, military, as, a, biological, weapon, richard, preston, s, 1995, best, selling, book, the, hot, zone, dramatised, the,

airborne, form, of, a, deadly, ebola, virus, strain, named, ebola, mayinga, see, mayinga, n, seka, as, the, ebola, virus, epidemic, in, west, africa, developed, in, 2014, a, number, of, popular, self, published, and, well, reviewed, books, containing, sensational, and, misleading, information, about, the, disease, appeared, in, electronic, and, printed, formats, the, authors, of, some, such, books, admitted, that, they, lacked, medical, credentials, and, were, not, technically, qualified, to, give, medical, advice, the, world, health, organization, and, the, united, nations, stated, that, such, misinformation, had, contributed, to, the, spread, of, the, disease, ebola, has, a, high, mortality, rate, among, primates, frequent, outbreaks, of, ebola, may, have, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, 5, 000, gorillas, outbreaks, of, ebola, may, have, been, responsible, for, an, 88, decline, in, tracking, indices, of, observed, chimpanzee, populations, in, the, 420, km, 2, lossi, sanctuary, between, 2002, and, 2003, transmission, among, chimpanzees, through, meat, consumption, constitutes, a, significant, risk, factor, whereas, contact, between, the, animals, such, as, touching, dead, bodies, and, grooming, is, not, recovered, gorilla, carcasses, have, contained, multiple, ebola, virus, strains, suggesting, multiple, introductions, of, the, virus, bodies, decompose, quickly, and, carcasses, are, not, infectious, after, three, to, four, days, contact, between, gorilla, groups, is, rare, suggesting, that, transmission, among, gorilla, groups, is, unlikely, and, that, outbreaks, result, from, transmission, between, viral, reservoirs, and, animal, populations, in, 2012, it, was, demonstrated, that, the, virus, can, travel, without, contact, from, pigs, to, nonhuman, primates, although, the, same, study, failed, to, achieve, transmission, in, that, manner, between, primates, dogs, may, become, infected, with, ebov, but, not, develop, symptoms, dogs, in, some, parts, of, africa, scavenge, for, food, and, they, sometimes, eat, ebov, infected, animals, and, also, the, corpses, of, humans, a, 2005, survey, of, dogs, during, an, ebov, outbreak, found, that, although, they, remain, asymptomatic, about, 32, percent, of, dogs, closest, to, an, outbreak, showed, a, seroprevalence, for, ebov, versus, nine, percent, of, those, farther, away, the, authors, concluded, that, there, were, potential, implications, for, preventing, and, controlling, human, outbreaks, in, late, 1989, hazelton, research, products, reston, quarantine, unit, in, reston, virginia, had, an, outbreak, of, fatal, illness, amongst, certain, lab, monkeys, this, lab, outbreak, was, initially, diagnosed, as, simian, haemorrhagic, fever, virus, shfv, and, occurred, amongst, a, shipment, of, crab, eating, macaque, monkeys, imported, from, the, philippines, hazelton, s, veterinary, pathologist, in, reston, sent, tissue, samples, from, dead, animals, to, the, united, states, army, medical, research, institute, of, infectious, diseases, usamriid, at, fort, detrick, maryland, where, an, elisa, test, indicated, the, antibodies, present, in, the, tissue, were, a, response, to, ebola, virus, and, not, shfv, an, electron, microscopist, from, usamriid, discovered, filoviruses, similar, in, appearance, in, crystalloid, aggregates, and, as, single, filaments, with, a, shepherd, s, hook, to, ebola, in, the, tissue, samples, sent, from, hazelton, research, products, reston, quarantine, unit, a, us, army, team, headquartered, at, usamriid, euthanised, the, surviving, monkeys, and, brought, all, the, dead, monkeys, to, fort, detrick, for, study, by, the, army, s, veterinary, pathologists, and, virologists, and, eventual, disposal, under, safe, conditions, blood, samples, were, taken, from, 178, animal, handlers, during, the, incident, of, those, six, animal, handlers, eventually, seroconverted, including, one, who, had, cut, himself, with, a, bloody, scalpel, despite, its, status, as, a, level, 4, organism, and, its, apparent, pathogenicity, in, monkeys, when, the, handlers, did, not, become, ill, the, cdc, concluded, that, the, virus, had, a, very, low, pathogenicity, to, humans, the, philippines, and, the, united, states, had, no, previous, cases, of, ebola, infection, and, upon, further, isolation, researchers, concluded, it, was, another, strain, of, ebola, or, a, new, filovirus, of, asian, origin, which, they, named, reston, ebolavirus, restv, after, the, location, of, the, incident, reston, virus, restv, can, be, transmitted, to, pigs, since, the, initial, outbreak, it, has, since, been, found, in, nonhuman, primates, in, pennsylvania, texas, and, italy, where, the, virus, had, infected, pigs, according, to, the, who, routine, cleaning, and, disinfection, of, pig, or, monkey, farms, with, sodium, hypochlorite, or, detergents, should, be, effective, in, inactivating, the, reston, ebolavirus, pigs, that, have, been, infected, with, restv, tend, to, show, symptoms, of, the, disease, as, of, july, 2015, no, medication, has, been, proven, safe, and, effective, for, treating, ebola, by, the, time, the, ebola, virus, epidemic, in, west, africa, began, in, 2013, there, were, at, least, nine, different, candidate, treatments, several, trials, were, conducted, in, late, 2014, and, early, 2015, but, some, were, abandoned, due, to, lack, of, efficacy, or, lack, of, people, to, study, as, of, august, 2019, two, experimental, treatments, known, as, atoltivimab, maftivimab, odesivimab, and, ansuvimab, were, found, to, be, 90, effective, the, diagnostic, tests, currently, available, require, specialised, equipment, and, highly, trained, personnel, since, there, are, few, suitable, testing, centres, in, west, africa, this, leads, to, delay, in, diagnosis, on, 29, november, 2014, a, new, 15, minute, ebola, test, was, reported, that, if, successful, not, only, gives, patients, a, better, chance, of, survival, but, it, prevents, transmission, of, the, virus, to, other, people, the, new, equipment, about, the, size, of, a, laptop, and, solar, powered, allows, testing, to, be, done, in, remote, areas, on, 29, december, 2014, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, approved, the, lightmix, ebola, zaire, rrt, pcr, test, for, patients, with, symptoms, of, ebola, animal, models, and, in, particular, non, human, primates, are, being, used, to, study, different, aspects, of, ebola, virus, disease, developments, in, organ, on, a, chip, technology, have, led, to, a, chip, based, model, for, ebola, haemorrhagic,
