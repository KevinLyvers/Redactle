see, text, the, bulbuls, are, members, of, a, family, pycnonotidae, of, medium, sized, passerine, songbirds, which, also, includes, greenbuls, brownbuls, leafloves, and, bristlebills, the, family, is, distributed, across, most, of, africa, and, into, the, middle, east, tropical, asia, to, indonesia, and, north, as, far, as, japan, a, few, insular, species, occur, on, the, tropical, islands, of, the, indian, ocean, there, are, 166, species, in, 32, genera, while, different, species, are, found, in, a, wide, range, of, habitats, the, african, species, are, predominantly, found, in, rainforest, whereas, asian, bulbuls, are, predominantly, found, in, more, open, areas, the, family, pycnonotidae, was, introduced, by, the, english, zoologist, george, robert, gray, in, 1840, as, a, subfamily, pycnonotinae, of, the, thrush, family, turdidae, the, arabic, word, bulbul, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, the, nightingale, as, well, as, the, bulbul, but, the, english, word, bulbul, refers, to, the, birds, discussed, in, this, article, a, few, species, that, were, previously, considered, to, be, members, of, the, pycnonotidae, have, been, moved, to, other, families, several, malagasy, species, that, were, formerly, placed, in, the, genus, phyllastrephus, are, now, placed, in, the, family, bernieridae, in, addition, the, genus, nicator, containing, three, african, species, is, now, placed, in, a, separate, family, nicatoridae, a, study, published, in, 2007, by, ulf, johansson, and, colleagues, using, three, nuclear, markers, found, that, the, genus, andropadus, was, non, monophyletic, in, the, subsequent, revision, species, were, moved, to, three, resurrected, genera, arizelocichla, stelgidillas, and, eurillas, only, the, sombre, greenbul, andropadus, importunus, was, retained, in, andropadus, a, study, by, subir, shakya, and, frederick, shelden, published, in, 2017, found, that, species, in, the, large, genus, pycnonotus, formed, several, deeply, divergent, clades, the, genus, was, split, and, six, genera, were, resurrected, to, accommodate, these, clades, the, family, forms, two, main, clades, one, clade, contains, species, that, are, only, found, in, africa, many, of, these, have, greenbul, in, the, common, name, the, second, clade, contains, mostly, asian, species, but, includes, a, few, species, that, are, found, in, africa, pycnonotidae, bulbuls, 167, species, paradoxornithidae, parrotbills, and, myzornis, 38, species, sylviidae, sylviid, babblers, 32, species, zosteropidae, white, eyes, 152, species, timaliidae, tree, babblers, 58, species, pellorneidae, ground, babblers, 68, species, alcippeidae, alcippe, fulvettas, 10, species, leiothrichidae, laughingthrushes, and, allies, 133, species, currently, there, are, 167, recognized, species, in, 32, genera, andropadus, sombre, greenbul, calyptocichla, golden, greenbul, stelgidillas, slender, billed, greenbul, neolestes, black, collared, bulbul, phyllastrephus, greenbuls,

alcurus, striated, bulbul, iole, 7, species, acritillas, yellow, browed, bulbul, hemixos, 4, species, hypsipetes, 25, species, ixos, 5, species, bulbuls, are, short, necked, slender, passerines, the, tails, are, long, and, the, wings, short, and, rounded, in, almost, all, species, the, bill, is, slightly, elongated, and, slightly, hooked, at, the, end, they, vary, in, length, from, 13, cm, and, 13, 3, g, 0, 47, oz, for, the, tiny, greenbul, to, 29, cm, and, 93, g, 3, 3, oz, in, the, straw, headed, bulbul, overall, the, sexes, are, alike, although, the, females, tend, to, be, slightly, smaller, in, a, few, species, the, differences, are, so, great, that, they, have, been, described, as, functionally, different, species, the, soft, plumage, of, some, species, is, colorful, with, yellow, red, or, orange, vents, cheeks, throat, or, supercilia, but, most, are, drab, with, uniform, olive, brown, to, black, plumage, species, with, dull, coloured, eyes, often, sport, contrasting, eyerings, some, have, very, distinct, crests, bulbuls, are, highly, vocal, with, the, calls, of, most, species, being, described, as, nasal, or, gravelly, one, author, described, the, song, of, the, brown, eared, bulbul, as, one, of, the, most, unattractive, noises, made, by, any, bird, the, bulbuls, are, generally, monogamous, one, unusual, exception, is, the, yellow, whiskered, greenbul, which, at, least, over, part, of, its, range, appears, to, be, polygamous, and, engage, in, a, lekking, system, some, species, also, have, alloparenting, arrangements, where, non, breeders, usually, the, young, from, earlier, clutches, help, raise, the, young, of, a, dominant, breeding, pair, up, to, five, speckled, eggs, are, laid, in, open, tree, nests, and, incubated, by, the, female, incubation, usually, lasts, between, 11, and, 14, days, and, chicks, fledge, after, 12, 16, days, bulbuls, eat, a, wide, range, of, foods, ranging, from, fruit, to, seeds, nectar, small, insects, and, other, arthropods, and, even, small, vertebrates, the, majority, of, species, are, frugivorous, and, supplement, their, diet, with, some, insects, although, there, is, a, significant, minority, of, specialists, particularly, in, africa, open, country, species, in, particular, are, generalists, bulbuls, in, the, genus, criniger, and, bristlebills, in, the, genus, bleda, will, join, mixed, species, feeding, flocks, the, red, whiskered, bulbuls, and, red, vented, bulbuls, have, been, captured, for, the, pet, trade, in, great, numbers, and, have, been, widely, introduced, to, tropical, and, subtropical, areas, for, example, southern, florida, fiji, australia, and, hawaii, some, species, are, regarded, as, crop, pests, particularly, in, orchards, in, general, bulbuls, and, greenbuls, are, resistant, to, human, pressures, on, the, environment, and, are, tolerant, of, disturbed, habitat, around, 13, species, are, considered, threatened, by, human, activities, mostly, specialised, forest, species, that, are, threatened, by, habitat, loss
