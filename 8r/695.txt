toucans, t, u, k, n, uk, k, n, are, neotropical, birds, in, the, family, ramphastidae, the, ramphastidae, are, most, closely, related, to, the, toucan, barbets, they, are, brightly, marked, and, have, large, often, colorful, bills, the, family, includes, five, genera, and, over, 40, different, species, toucans, are, arboreal, and, typically, lay, two, to, four, white, eggs, in, their, nests, they, make, their, nests, in, tree, hollows, and, holes, excavated, by, other, animals, such, as, woodpeckers, the, toucan, bill, has, very, limited, use, as, an, excavation, tool, when, the, eggs, hatch, the, young, emerge, completely, naked, without, any, down, toucans, are, resident, breeders, and, do, not, migrate, toucans, are, usually, found, in, pairs, or, small, flocks, they, sometimes, fence, with, their, bills, and, wrestle, which, scientists, hypothesize, they, do, to, establish, dominance, hierarchies, in, africa, and, asia, hornbills, occupy, the, toucans, ecological, niche, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, the, name, of, this, bird, group, is, derived, from, the, tupi, word, tukana, or, the, guaran, word, tuk, via, portuguese, the, family, includes, toucans, aracaris, and, toucanets, more, distant, relatives, include, various, families, of, barbets, and, woodpeckers, in, the, suborder, pici, the, phylogenetic, relationship, between, the, toucans, and, the, eight, other, families, in, the, order, piciformes, is, shown, in, the, cladogram, below, the, number, of, species, in, each, family, is, taken, from, the, list, maintained, by, frank, gill, pamela, c, rasmussen, and, david, donsker, on, behalf, of, the, international, ornithological, committee, ioc, galbulidae, jacamars, 18, species, bucconidae, puffbirds, 38, species, indicatoridae, honeyguides,

toucan, barbets, 2, species, ramphastidae, toucans, 43, species, toucans, range, in, size, from, the, lettered, aracari, pteroglossus, inscriptus, at, 130, g, 4, 6, oz, and, 29, cm, 11, in, to, the, toco, toucan, ramphastos, toco, at, 680, g, 1, 50, lb, and, 63, cm, 25, in, their, bodies, are, short, of, comparable, size, to, a, crow, s, and, compact, the, tail, is, rounded, and, varies, in, length, from, half, the, length, to, the, whole, length, of, the, body, the, neck, is, short, and, thick, the, wings, are, small, as, they, are, forest, dwelling, birds, who, only, need, to, travel, short, distances, and, are, often, of, about, the, same, span, as, the, bill, tip, to, tail, tip, measurements, of, the, bird, the, legs, of, the, toucan, are, strong, and, rather, short, their, toes, are, arranged, in, pairs, with, the, first, and, fourth, toes, turned, backward, the, majority, of, toucans, do, not, show, any, sexual, dimorphism, in, their, coloration, the, genus, selenidera, being, the, most, notable, exception, to, this, rule, hence, their, common, name, dichromatic, toucanets, however, the, bills, of, female, toucans, are, usually, shorter, deeper, and, sometimes, straighter, giving, more, of, a, blocky, impression, compared, to, male, bills, the, feathers, in, the, genus, containing, the, largest, toucans, are, generally, purple, with, touches, of, white, yellow, and, scarlet, and, black, the, underparts, of, the, ara, aris, smaller, toucans, are, yellow, crossed, by, one, or, more, black, or, red, bands, the, toucanets, have, mostly, green, plumage, with, blue, markings, the, colorful, and, large, bill, which, in, some, large, species, measures, more, than, half, the, length, of, the, body, is, the, hallmark, of, toucans, despite, its, size, the, toucan, s, bill, is, very, light, being, composed, of, bone, struts, filled, with, spongy, tissue, of, keratin, between, them, which, take, on, the, structure, of, a, biofoam, the, bill, has, forward, facing, serrations, resembling, teeth, which, historically, led, naturalists, to, believe, that, toucans, captured, fish, and, were, primarily, carnivorous, today, it, is, known, that, they, eat, mostly, fruit, researchers, have, discovered, that, the, large, bill, of, the, toucan, is, a, highly, efficient, thermoregulation, system, though, its, size, may, still, be, advantageous, in, other, ways, it, does, aid, in, their, feeding, behavior, as, they, sit, in, one, spot, and, reach, for, all, fruit, in, range, thereby, reducing, energy, expenditure, and, it, has, also, been, theorized, that, the, bill, may, intimidate, smaller, birds, so, that, the, toucan, may, plunder, nests, undisturbed, see, diet, below, the, beak, allows, the, bird, to, reach, deep, into, tree, holes, to, access, food, unavailable, to, other, birds, and, also, to, ransack, suspended, nests, built, by, smaller, birds, a, toucan, s, tongue, is, long, up, to, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, narrow, grey, and, singularly, frayed, on, each, side, adding, to, its, sensitivity, as, a, tasting, organ, a, structural, complex, probably, unique, to, toucans, involves, the, modification, of, several, tail, vertebrae, the, rear, three, vertebrae, are, fused, and, attached, to, the, spine, by, a, ball, and, socket, joint, because, of, this, toucans, may, snap, their, tail, forward, until, it, touches, the, head, this, is, the, posture, in, which, they, sleep, often, appearing, simply, as, a, ball, of, feathers, with, the, tip, of, the, tail, sticking, out, over, the, head, toucans, are, native, to, the, neotropics, from, southern, mexico, through, central, america, into, south, america, south, to, northern, argentina, they, mostly, live, in, the, lowland, tropics, but, the, mountain, species, from, the, genus, andigena, reach, temperate, climates, at, high, altitudes, in, the, andes, and, can, be, found, up, to, the, tree, line, for, the, most, part, the, toucans, are, forest, species, and, restricted, to, primary, forests, they, will, enter, secondary, forests, to, forage, but, are, limited, to, forests, with, large, old, trees, that, have, holes, large, enough, to, breed, in, toucans, are, poor, dispersers, particularly, across, water, and, have, not, reached, the, west, indies, the, only, non, forest, living, toucan, is, the, toco, toucan, which, is, found, in, savannah, with, forest, patches, and, open, woodlands, toucans, are, highly, social, and, most, species, occur, in, groups, of, up, to, 20, or, more, birds, for, most, of, the, time, pairs, may, retire, from, the, groups, during, the, breeding, season, then, return, with, their, offspring, after, the, breeding, season, larger, groups, may, form, during, irruptions, migration, or, around, a, particularly, large, fruiting, tree, toucans, often, spend, time, sparring, with, their, bills, tag, chasing, and, calling, during, the, long, time, it, takes, for, fruit, to, digest, these, behaviours, may, be, related, to, maintenance, of, the, pair, bond, or, establishing, dominance, hierarchies, but, the, time, required, to, digest, fruit, which, can, be, up, to, 75, minutes, and, during, which, the, toucan, can, not, feed, provides, this, time, for, socializing, toucans, are, primarily, frugivorous, fruit, eating, but, are, opportunistically, omnivorous, and, will, take, prey, such, as, insects, smaller, birds, and, small, lizards, captive, toucans, have, been, reported, to, hunt, insects, actively, in, their, cages, and, it, is, possible, to, keep, toucans, on, an, insect, only, diet, they, also, plunder, nests, of, smaller, birds, taking, eggs, and, nestlings, this, probably, provides, a, crucial, addition, of, protein, to, their, diet, certainly, apart, from, being, systematically, predatory, as, well, as, frugivorous, like, many, omnivorous, birds, they, particularly, prefer, animal, food, for, feeding, their, chicks, however, in, their, range, toucans, are, the, dominant, frugivores, and, as, such, play, an, extremely, important, ecological, role, as, vectors, for, seed, dispersal, of, fruiting, trees, toucans, nest, in, cavities, in, trees, and, the, presence, of, suitable, trees, is, a, habitat, prerequisite, for, toucans, for, the, most, part, toucans, don, t, excavate, nesting, cavities, although, some, green, toucanets, do, toucans, make, a, variety, of, sounds, the, very, name, of, the, bird, from, tupi, refers, to, its, predominant, frog, like, croaking, call, but, toucans, also, make, barking, and, growling, sounds, they, also, use, their, bills, to, make, tapping, and, clattering, sounds, mountain, toucans, are, known, for, donkey, like, braying, the, toucans, are, due, to, their, unique, appearance, among, the, most, popular, and, well, known, birds, in, the, world, across, their, native, range, they, were, hunted, for, food, and, also, kept, as, pets, and, their, plumage, and, bills, were, used, for, decorations, in, some, places, anyone, that, discovers, a, nest, is, deemed, its, owner, and, is, entitled, to, sell, the, birds, within, in, the, western, world, they, were, first, popularised, by, john, gould, who, devoted, two, editions, to, a, detailed, monograph, of, the, family, the, constellation, tucana, containing, most, of, the, small, magellanic, cloud, is, named, after, the, toucan, the, family, has, been, used, prominently, in, advertising, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, guinness, beer, advertising, featured, a, toucan, as, the, black, and, white, appearance, of, the, bird, mirrored, the, stout, a, cartoon, toucan, toucan, sam, has, been, used, as, the, mascot, of, froot, loops, breakfast, cereal, since, 1963, and, a, toucan, is, the, mascot, of, the, brazilian, social, democracy, party, its, party, members, are, called, tucanos, for, this, reason, toucans, have, also, been, used, in, popular, media, they, have, been, used, as, the, principal, characters, in, toucan, tecs, a, 1992, uk, television, cartoon, about, two, detectives, named, zippi, and, zac, in, dora, the, explorer, the, character, se, or, t, can, is, a, spanish, speaking, toucan, who, occasionally, gives, dora, and, her, friends, advice, tuca, the, anthropomorphic, title, character, of, the, 2019, show, tuca, bertie, is, a, toucan, and, the, companion, of, the, song, thrush, bertie, in, the, 2016, nintendo, 3ds, game, pok, mon, sun, and, moon, the, pok, mon, toucannon, and, its, previous, evolutions, were, modeled, after, a, toco, toucan
