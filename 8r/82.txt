the, brainstem, or, brain, stem, is, the, posterior, stalk, like, part, of, the, brain, that, connects, the, cerebrum, with, the, spinal, cord, in, the, human, brain, the, brainstem, is, composed, of, the, midbrain, the, pons, and, the, medulla, oblongata, the, midbrain, is, continuous, with, the, thalamus, of, the, diencephalon, through, the, tentorial, notch, and, sometimes, the, diencephalon, is, included, in, the, brainstem, the, brainstem, is, very, small, making, up, around, only, 2, 6, percent, of, the, brain, s, total, weight, it, has, the, critical, roles, of, regulating, heart, and, respiratory, function, helping, to, control, heart, rate, and, breathing, rate, it, also, provides, the, main, motor, and, sensory, nerve, supply, to, the, face, and, neck, via, the, cranial, nerves, ten, pairs, of, cranial, nerves, come, from, the, brainstem, other, roles, include, the, regulation, of, the, central, nervous, system, and, the, body, s, sleep, cycle, it, is, also, of, prime, importance, in, the, conveyance, of, motor, and, sensory, pathways, from, the, rest, of, the, brain, to, the, body, and, from, the, body, back, to, the, brain, these, pathways, include, the, corticospinal, tract, motor, function, the, dorsal, column, medial, lemniscus, pathway, fine, touch, vibration, sensation, and, proprioception, and, the, spinothalamic, tract, pain, temperature, itch, and, crude, touch, the, parts, of, the, brainstem, are, the, midbrain, the, pons, and, the, medulla, oblongata, the, diencephalon, is, sometimes, considered, part, of, the, brainstem, the, brainstem, extends, from, just, above, the, tentorial, notch, superiorly, to, the, first, cervical, vertebra, below, the, foramen, magnum, inferiorly, the, midbrain, is, further, subdivided, into, three, parts, tectum, tegmentum, and, the, ventral, tegmental, area, the, tectum, forms, the, ceiling, the, tectum, comprises, the, paired, structure, of, the, superior, and, inferior, colliculi, and, is, the, dorsal, covering, of, the, cerebral, aqueduct, the, inferior, colliculus, is, the, principal, midbrain, nucleus, of, the, auditory, pathway, and, receives, input, from, several, peripheral, brainstem, nuclei, as, well, as, inputs, from, the, auditory, cortex, its, inferior, brachium, arm, like, process, reaches, to, the, medial, geniculate, nucleus, of, the, diencephalon, the, superior, colliculus, is, positioned, above, the, inferior, colliculus, and, marks, the, rostral, midbrain, it, is, involved, in, the, special, sense, of, vision, and, sends, its, superior, brachium, to, the, lateral, geniculate, body, of, the, diencephalon, the, tegmentum, which, forms, the, floor, of, the, midbrain, is, ventral, to, the, cerebral, aqueduct, several, nuclei, tracts, and, the, reticular, formation, are, contained, here, the, ventral, tegmental, area, vta, is, composed, of, paired, cerebral, peduncles, these, transmit, axons, of, upper, motor, neurons, the, midbrain, consists, of, the, pons, lies, between, the, midbrain, and, the, medulla, oblongata, it, is, separated, from, the, midbrain, by, the, superior, pontine, sulcus, and, from, the, medulla, by, the, inferior, pontine, sulcus, it, contains, tracts, that, carry, signals, from, the, cerebrum, to, the, medulla, and, to, the, cerebellum, and, also, tracts, that, carry, sensory, signals, to, the, thalamus, the, pons, is, connected, to, the, cerebellum, by, the, cerebellar, peduncles, the, pons, houses, the, respiratory, pneumotaxic, center, and, apneustic, center, that, make, up, the, pontine, respiratory, group, in, the, respiratory, center, the, pons, co, ordinates, activities, of, the, cerebellar, hemispheres, the, pons, and, medulla, oblongata, are, parts, of, the, hindbrain, that, form, much, of, the, brainstem, the, medulla, oblongata, often, just, referred, to, as, the, medulla, is, the, lower, half, of, the, brainstem, continuous, with, the, spinal, cord, its, upper, part, is, continuous, with, the, pons, 1121, the, medulla, contains, the, cardiac, dorsal, and, ventral, respiratory, groups, and, vasomotor, centres, dealing, with, heart, rate, breathing, and, blood, pressure, another, important, medullary, structure, is, the, area, postrema, whose, functions, include, the, control, of, vomiting, in, the, medial, part, of, the, medulla, is, the, anterior, median, fissure, moving, laterally, on, each, side, are, the, medullary, pyramids, the, pyramids, contain, the, fibers, of, the, corticospinal, tract, also, called, the, pyramidal, tract, or, the, upper, motor, neuronal, axons, as, they, head, inferiorly, to, synapse, on, lower, motor, neuronal, cell, bodies, within, the, anterior, grey, column, of, the, spinal, cord, the, anterolateral, sulcus, is, lateral, to, the, pyramids, emerging, from, the, anterolateral, sulci, are, the, cn, xii, hypoglossal, nerve, rootlets, lateral, to, these, rootlets, and, the, anterolateral, sulci, are, the, olives, the, olives, are, swellings, in, the, medulla, containing, underlying, inferior, nucleary, nuclei, containing, various, nuclei, and, afferent, fibers, lateral, and, dorsal, to, the, olives, are, the, rootlets, for, cn, ix, glossopharyngeal, cn, x, vagus, and, cn, xi, accessory, nerve, the, pyramids, end, at, the, pontine, medulla, junction, noted, most, obviously, by, the, large, basal, pons, from, this, junction, cn, vi, abducens, nerve, cn, vii, facial, nerve, and, cn, viii, vestibulocochlear, nerve, emerge, at, the, level, of, the, midpons, cn, v, the, trigeminal, nerve, emerges, cranial, nerve, iii, the, oculomotor, nerve, emerges, ventrally, from, the, midbrain, while, the, cn, iv, the, trochlear, nerve, emerges, out, from, the, dorsal, aspect, of, the, midbrain, between, the, two, pyramids, can, be, seen, a, decussation, of, fibers, which, marks, the, transition, from, the, medulla, to, the, spinal, cord, the, medulla, is, above, the, decussation, and, the, spinal, cord, below, the, most, medial, part, of, the, medulla, is, the, posterior, median, sulcus, moving, laterally, on, each, side, is, the, gracile, fasciculus, and, lateral, to, that, is, the, cuneate, fasciculus, superior, to, each, of, these, and, directly, inferior, to, the, obex, are, the, gracile, and, cuneate, tubercles, respectively, underlying, these, are, their, respective, nuclei, the, obex, marks, the, end, of, the, fourth, ventricle, and, the, beginning, of, the, central, canal, the, posterior, intermediate, sulcus, separates, the, gracile, fasciculus, from, the, cuneate, fasciculus, lateral, to, the, cuneate, fasciculus, is, the, lateral, funiculus, superior, to, the, obex, is, the, floor, of, the, fourth, ventricle, in, the, floor, of, the, fourth, ventricle, various, nuclei, can, be, visualized, by, the, small, bumps, that, they, make, in, the, overlying, tissue, in, the, midline, and, directly, superior, to, the, obex, is, the, vagal, trigone, and, superior, to, that, it, the, hypoglossal, trigone, underlying, each, of, these, are, motor, nuclei, for, the, respective, cranial, nerves, superior, to, these, trigones, are, fibers, running, laterally, in, both, directions, these, fibers, are, known, collectively, as, the, striae, medullares, continuing, in, a, rostral, direction, the, large, bumps, are, called, the, facial, colliculi, each, facial, colliculus, contrary, to, their, names, do, not, contain, the, facial, nerve, nuclei, instead, they, have, facial, nerve, axons, traversing, superficial, to, underlying, abducens, cn, vi, nuclei, lateral, to, all, these, bumps, previously, discussed, is, an, indented, line, or, sulcus, that, runs, rostrally, and, is, known, as, the, sulcus, limitans, this, separates, the, medial, motor, neurons, from, the, lateral, sensory, neurons, lateral, to, the, sulcus, limitans, is, the, area, of, the, vestibular, system, which, is, involved, in, special, sensation, moving, rostrally, the, inferior, middle, and, superior, cerebellar, peduncles, are, found, connecting, the, midbrain, to, the, cerebellum, directly, rostral, to, the, superior, cerebellar, peduncle, there, is, the, superior, medullary, velum, and, then, the, two, trochlear, nerves, this, marks, the, end, of, the, pons, as, the, inferior, colliculus, is, directly, rostral, and, marks, the, caudal, midbrain, middle, cerebellar, peduncle, is, located, inferior, and, lateral, to, the, superior, cerebellar, peduncle, connecting, pons, to, the, cerebellum, likewise, inferior, cerebellar, peduncle, is, found, connecting, the, medulla, oblongata, to, the, cerebellum, the, main, supply, of, blood, to, the, brainstem, is, provided, by, the, basilar, arteries, and, the, vertebral, arteries, 740, the, human, brainstem, emerges, from, two, of, the, three, primary, brain, vesicles, formed, of, the, neural, tube, the, mesencephalon, is, the, second, of, the, three, primary, vesicles, and, does, not, further, differentiate, into, a, secondary, brain, vesicle, this, will, become, the, midbrain, the, third, primary, vesicle, the, rhombencephalon, hindbrain, will, further, differentiate, into, two, secondary, vesicles, the, metencephalon, and, the, myelencephalon, the, metencephalon, will, become, the, cerebellum, and, the, pons, the, more, caudal, myelencephalon, will, become, the, medulla, the, brainstem, plays, important, functions, in, breathing, heart, rate, arousal, consciousness, sleep, wake, functions, and, attention, concentration, there, are, three, main, functions, of, the, brainstem, ten, of, the, twelve, pairs, of, cranial, nerves, either, target, or, are, sourced, from, the, brainstem, nuclei, 725, the, nuclei, of, the, oculomotor, nerve, iii, and, trochlear, nerve, iv, are, located, in, the, midbrain, the, nuclei, of, the, trigeminal, nerve, v, abducens, nerve, vi, facial, nerve, vii, and, vestibulocochlear, nerve, viii, are, located, in, the, pons, the, nuclei, of, the, glossopharyngeal, nerve, ix, vagus, nerve, x, accessory, nerve, xi, and, hypoglossal, nerve, xii, are, located, in, the, medulla, the, fibers, of, these, cranial, nerves, exit, the, brainstem, from, these, nuclei, diseases, of, the, brainstem, can, result, in, abnormalities, in, the, function, of, cranial, nerves, that, may, lead, to, visual, disturbances, pupil, abnormalities, changes, in, sensation, muscle, weakness, hearing, problems, vertigo, swallowing, and, speech, difficulty, voice, change, and, co, ordination, problems, localizing, neurological, lesions, in, the, brainstem, may, be, very, precise, although, it, relies, on, a, clear, understanding, on, the, functions, of, brainstem, anatomical, structures, and, how, to, test, them, brainstem, stroke, syndrome, can, cause, a, range, of, impairments, including, locked, in, syndrome, duret, haemorrhages, are, areas, of, bleeding, in, the, midbrain, and, upper, pons, due, to, a, downward, traumatic, displacement, of, the, brainstem, 842, cysts, known, as, syrinxes, can, affect, the, brainstem, in, a, condition, called, syringobulbia, these, fluid, filled, cavities, can, be, congenital, acquired, or, the, result, of, a, tumor, criteria, for, claiming, brainstem, death, in, the, uk, have, developed, in, order, to, make, the, decision, of, when, to, stop, ventilation, of, somebody, who, could, not, otherwise, sustain, life, these, determining, factors, are, that, the, patient, is, irreversibly, unconscious, and, incapable, of, breathing, unaided, all, other, possible, causes, must, be, ruled, out, that, might, otherwise, indicate, a, temporary, condition, the, state, of, irreversible, brain, damage, has, to, be, unequivocal, there, are, brainstem, reflexes, that, are, checked, for, by, two, senior, doctors, so, that, imaging, technology, is, unnecessary, the, absence, of, the, cough, and, gag, reflexes, of, the, corneal, reflex, and, the, vestibulo, ocular, reflex, need, to, be, established, the, pupils, of, the, eyes, must, be, fixed, and, dilated, there, must, be, an, absence, of, motor, response, to, stimulation, and, an, absence, of, breathing, marked, by, concentrations, of, carbon, dioxide, in, the, arterial, blood, all, of, these, tests, must, be, repeated, after, a, certain, time, before, death, can, be, declared
