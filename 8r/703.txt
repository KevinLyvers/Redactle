a, cockatoo, is, any, of, the, 21, species, of, parrots, belonging, to, the, family, cacatuidae, the, only, family, in, the, superfamily, cacatuoidea, along, with, the, psittacoidea, true, parrots, and, the, strigopoidea, large, new, zealand, parrots, they, make, up, the, order, psittaciformes, the, family, has, a, mainly, australasian, distribution, ranging, from, the, philippines, and, the, eastern, indonesian, islands, of, wallacea, to, new, guinea, the, solomon, islands, and, australia, cockatoos, are, recognisable, by, the, prominent, crests, and, curved, bills, their, plumage, is, generally, less, colourful, than, that, of, other, parrots, being, mainly, white, grey, or, black, and, often, with, coloured, features, in, the, crest, cheeks, or, tail, on, average, they, are, larger, than, other, parrots, however, the, cockatiel, the, smallest, cockatoo, species, is, medium, sized, the, phylogenetic, position, of, the, cockatiel, remains, unresolved, except, that, it, is, one, of, the, earliest, offshoots, of, the, cockatoo, lineage, the, remaining, species, are, in, two, main, clades, the, five, large, black, coloured, cockatoos, of, the, genus, calyptorhynchus, form, one, branch, the, second, and, larger, branch, is, formed, by, the, genus, cacatua, comprising, 12, species, of, white, plumaged, cockatoos, and, three, monotypic, genera, that, branched, off, earlier, namely, the, pink, and, grey, galah, the, mainly, grey, gang, gang, cockatoo, and, the, large, black, plumaged, palm, cockatoo, cockatoos, prefer, to, eat, seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers, and, insects, they, often, feed, in, large, flocks, particularly, when, ground, feeding, cockatoos, are, monogamous, and, nest, in, tree, hollows, some, cockatoo, species, have, been, adversely, affected, by, habitat, loss, particularly, from, a, shortage, of, suitable, nesting, hollows, after, large, mature, trees, are, cleared, conversely, some, species, have, adapted, well, to, human, changes, and, are, considered, agricultural, pests, cockatoos, are, popular, birds, in, aviculture, but, their, needs, are, difficult, to, meet, the, cockatiel, is, the, easiest, cockatoo, species, to, maintain, and, is, by, far, the, most, frequently, kept, in, captivity, white, cockatoos, are, more, commonly, found, in, captivity, than, black, cockatoos, illegal, trade, in, wild, caught, birds, contributes, to, the, decline, of, some, cockatoo, species, in, the, wild, the, word, cockatoo, dates, from, the, 17th, century, and, is, derived, from, dutch, kaketoe, which, in, turn, is, from, the, indonesian, malay, kakatua, seventeenth, century, variants, include, cacato, cockatoon, and, crockadore, and, cokato, cocatore, and, cocatoo, were, used, in, the, eighteenth, century, the, derivation, has, also, been, used, for, the, family, and, generic, names, cacatuidae, and, cacatua, respectively, in, australian, slang, or, vernacular, speech, a, person, who, is, assigned, to, keep, watch, while, others, undertake, clandestine, or, illegal, activities, particularly, gambling, may, be, referred, to, as, a, cockatoo, proprietors, of, small, agricultural, undertakings, are, often, jocularly, or, slightly, disparagingly, referred, to, as, cocky, farmers, strigopidae, new, zealand, parrots, cacatuidae, cockatoos, psittacidae, african, and, new, world, parrots, psittaculidae, old, world, parrots, calyptorhynchus, black, cockatoos, 2, species, zanda, black, cockatoos, 3, species, nymphicus, cockatiel, probosciger, palm, cockatoo, callocephalon, gang, gang, cockatoo, eolophus, galah, lophochroa, pink, cockatoo, cacatua, white, cockatoos, and, corellas, 13, species, the, cockatoos, were, first, defined, as, a, subfamily, cacatuinae, within, the, parrot, family, psittacidae, by, the, english, naturalist, george, robert, gray, in, 1840, with, cacatua, the, first, listed, and, type, genus, this, group, has, alternately, been, considered, as, either, a, full, or, subfamily, by, different, authorities, the, american, ornithologist, james, lee, peters, in, his, 1937, check, list, of, birds, of, the, world, and, sibley, and, monroe, in, 1990, maintained, it, as, a, subfamily, while, parrot, expert, joseph, forshaw, classified, it, as, a, family, in, 1973, subsequent, molecular, studies, indicate, that, the, earliest, offshoot, from, the, original, parrot, ancestors, were, the, new, zealand, parrots, of, the, family, strigopidae, and, following, this, the, cockatoos, now, a, well, defined, group, or, clade, split, off, from, the, remaining, parrots, which, then, radiated, across, the, southern, hemisphere, and, diversified, into, the, many, species, of, parrots, parakeets, macaws, lories, lorikeets, lovebirds, and, other, true, parrots, of, the, superfamily, psittacoidea, the, relationships, among, various, cockatoo, genera, are, largely, resolved, although, the, placement, of, the, cockatiel, nymphicus, hollandicus, at, the, base, of, the, cockatoos, remains, uncertain, the, cockatiel, is, alternatively, placed, basal, to, all, other, cockatoo, species, as, the, sister, taxon, to, the, black, cockatoo, species, of, the, genus, calyptorhynchus, or, as, the, sister, taxon, to, a, clade, consisting, of, the, white, and, pink, cockatoo, genera, as, well, as, the, palm, cockatoo, the, remaining, species, are, within, two, main, clades, one, consisting, of, the, black, species, of, the, genus, calyptorhynchus, while, the, other, contains, the, remaining, species, according, to, most, authorities, the, second, clade, includes, the, black, palm, cockatoo, probosciger, the, grey, and, reddish, galah, eolophus, and, the, gang, gang, cockatoo, callocephalon, although, probosciger, is, sometimes, placed, basal, to, all, other, species, the, remaining, species, are, mainly, white, or, slightly, pinkish, and, all, belong, to, the, genus, cacatua, the, genera, eolophus, and, cacatua, are, hypomelanistic, the, genus, cacatua, is, further, subdivided, into, the, subgenera, licmetis, commonly, known, as, corellas, and, cacatua, referred, to, as, white, cockatoos, confusingly, the, term, white, cockatoo, has, also, been, applied, to, the, whole, genus, the, five, cockatoo, species, of, the, genus, calyptorhynchus, are, commonly, known, as, black, cockatoos, and, are, divided, into, two, subgenera, calyptorhynchus, and, zanda, the, former, group, are, sexually, dichromatic, with, the, females, having, prominently, barred, plumage, the, two, are, also, distinguished, by, differences, in, the, food, begging, calls, of, juveniles, the, fossil, record, of, cockatoos, is, even, more, limited, than, that, of, parrots, in, general, with, only, one, truly, ancient, cockatoo, fossil, known, a, species, of, cacatua, most, probably, subgenus, licmetis, found, in, early, miocene, 16, 23, million, years, ago, deposits, of, riversleigh, australia, although, fragmentary, the, remains, are, similar, to, the, western, corella, and, the, galah, in, melanesia, subfossil, bones, of, cacatua, species, which, apparently, did, not, survive, early, human, settlement, have, been, found, on, new, caledonia, and, new, ireland, the, bearing, of, these, fossils, on, cockatoo, evolution, and, phylogeny, is, fairly, limited, although, the, riversleigh, fossil, does, allow, tentative, dating, of, the, divergence, of, subfamilies, there, are, about, 44, different, birds, in, the, cockatoo, family, cacatuidae, including, recognized, subspecies, the, current, subdivision, of, this, family, is, as, follows, subfamily, nymphicinae, subfamily, calyptorhynchinae, black, cockatoos, subfamily, cacatuinae, the, cockatoos, are, generally, medium, to, large, parrots, of, stocky, build, which, range, from, 30, 60, cm, 12, 24, in, in, length, and, 300, 1, 200, g, 0, 66, 2, 65, lb, in, weight, however, one, species, the, cockatiel, is, considerably, smaller, and, slimmer, than, the, other, species, being, 32, cm, 13, in, long, including, its, long, pointed, tail, feathers, and, 80, 100, g, 2, 8, 3, 5, oz, in, weight, the, movable, headcrest, which, is, present, in, all, cockatoos, is, spectacular, in, many, species, it, is, raised, when, the, bird, lands, from, flying, or, when, it, is, aroused, cockatoos, share, many, features, with, other, parrots, including, the, characteristic, curved, beak, shape, and, a, zygodactyl, foot, with, the, two, middle, toes, forward, and, the, two, outer, toes, backward, they, differ, in, the, presence, of, an, erectile, crest, and, their, lack, of, the, dyck, texture, feather, composition, which, causes, the, bright, blues, and, greens, seen, in, true, parrots, like, other, parrots, cockatoos, have, short, legs, strong, claws, a, waddling, gait, and, often, use, their, strong, bill, as, a, third, limb, when, climbing, through, branches, they, generally, have, long, broad, wings, used, in, rapid, flight, with, speeds, up, to, 70, km, h, 43, mph, being, recorded, for, galahs, the, members, of, the, genus, calyptorhynchus, and, larger, white, cockatoos, such, as, the, sulphur, crested, cockatoo, and, the, pink, cockatoo, have, shorter, rounder, wings, and, a, more, leisurely, flight, cockatoos, have, a, large, bill, which, is, kept, sharp, by, rasping, the, two, jaws, together, when, resting, the, bill, is, complemented, by, a, large, muscular, tongue, which, helps, manipulate, seeds, inside, the, bill, so, that, they, can, be, de, husked, before, eating, during, the, de, husking, the, lower, jaw, applies, the, pressure, the, tongue, holds, the, seed, in, place, and, the, upper, jaw, acts, as, an, anvil, the, eye, region, of, the, skull, is, reinforced, to, support, muscles, which, move, the, jaws, sideways, the, bills, of, male, cockatoos, are, generally, slightly, larger, than, those, of, their, female, counterparts, but, this, size, difference, is, quite, marked, in, the, palm, cockatoo, the, plumage, of, the, cockatoos, is, less, brightly, coloured, than, that, of, the, other, parrots, with, species, generally, being, either, black, grey, or, white, many, species, have, smaller, areas, of, colour, on, their, plumage, often, yellow, pink, and, red, usually, on, the, crest, or, tail, the, galah, and, major, mitchell, s, cockatoo, are, more, broadly, coloured, in, pink, tones, several, species, have, a, brightly, coloured, bare, area, around, the, eye, and, face, known, as, a, periophthalmic, ring, the, large, red, patch, of, bare, skin, of, the, palm, cockatoo, is, the, most, extensive, and, covers, some, of, the, face, while, it, is, more, restricted, in, some, other, species, of, white, cockatoo, notably, the, corellas, and, blue, eyed, cockatoo, the, plumage, of, males, and, females, is, similar, in, most, species, the, plumage, of, the, female, cockatiel, is, duller, than, the, male, but, the, most, marked, sexual, dimorphism, occurs, in, the, gang, gang, cockatoo, and, the, two, species, of, black, cockatoos, in, the, subgenus, calyptorhynchus, namely, the, red, tailed, and, glossy, black, cockatoos, the, iris, colour, differs, in, a, few, species, being, pink, or, red, in, the, female, galah, and, the, pink, cockatoo, and, red, brown, in, some, other, female, white, cockatoo, species, the, males, all, have, dark, brown, irises, cockatoos, maintain, their, plumage, with, frequent, preening, throughout, the, day, they, remove, dirt, and, oil, and, realign, feather, barbs, by, nibbling, their, feathers, they, also, preen, other, birds, feathers, that, are, otherwise, hard, to, get, at, cockatoos, produce, preen, oil, from, a, gland, on, their, lower, back, and, apply, it, by, wiping, their, plumage, with, their, heads, or, already, oiled, feathers, powder, down, is, produced, by, specialised, feathers, in, the, lumbar, region, and, distributed, by, the, preening, cockatoo, all, over, the, plumage, moulting, is, very, slow, and, complex, black, cockatoos, appear, to, replace, their, flight, feathers, one, at, a, time, their, moult, taking, two, years, to, complete, this, process, is, much, shorter, in, other, species, such, as, the, galah, and, long, billed, corella, which, each, take, around, six, months, to, replace, all, their, flight, feathers, the, vocalisations, of, cockatoos, are, loud, and, harsh, they, serve, a, number, of, functions, including, allowing, individuals, to, recognize, one, another, alerting, others, of, predators, indicating, individual, moods, maintaining, the, cohesion, of, a, flock, and, as, warnings, when, defending, nests, the, use, of, calls, and, number, of, specific, calls, varies, by, species, the, carnaby, s, black, cockatoo, has, as, many, as, 15, types, of, call, whereas, others, such, as, the, pink, cockatoo, have, fewer, some, like, the, gang, gang, cockatoo, are, comparatively, quiet, but, do, have, softer, growling, calls, when, feeding, in, addition, to, vocalisations, palm, cockatoos, communicate, over, large, distances, by, drumming, on, a, dead, branch, with, a, stick, cockatoo, species, also, make, a, characteristic, hissing, sound, when, threatened, cockatoos, have, a, much, more, restricted, range, than, the, true, parrots, occurring, naturally, only, in, australia, indonesia, the, philippines, and, some, pacific, regions, eleven, of, the, 21, species, exist, in, the, wild, only, in, australia, while, seven, species, occur, only, in, the, islands, of, the, philippines, indonesia, papua, new, guinea, and, the, solomon, islands, no, cockatoo, species, are, found, in, borneo, despite, their, presence, on, nearby, palawan, and, sulawesi, or, many, pacific, islands, although, fossil, remains, have, been, recorded, from, new, caledonia, three, species, occur, in, both, new, guinea, and, australia, some, species, have, widespread, distributions, with, the, galah, for, example, occurring, over, most, of, australia, whereas, other, species, have, tiny, distributions, confined, to, a, small, part, of, the, continent, such, as, the, baudin, s, black, cockatoo, of, western, australia, or, to, a, small, island, group, such, as, the, tanimbar, corella, which, is, restricted, to, the, tanimbar, islands, of, indonesia, some, cockatoos, have, been, introduced, accidentally, to, areas, outside, their, natural, range, such, as, new, zealand, singapore, and, palau, while, two, australian, corella, species, have, been, introduced, to, parts, of, the, continent, where, they, are, not, native, cockatoos, occupy, a, wide, range, of, habitats, from, forests, in, subalpine, regions, to, mangroves, however, no, species, is, found, in, all, types, of, habitat, the, most, widespread, species, such, as, the, galah, and, cockatiel, are, open, country, specialists, that, feed, on, grass, seeds, they, are, often, highly, mobile, fast, flyers, and, are, nomadic, flocks, of, birds, move, across, large, areas, of, the, inland, locating, and, feeding, on, seed, and, other, food, sources, drought, may, force, flocks, from, more, arid, areas, to, move, further, into, farming, areas, other, cockatoo, species, such, as, the, glossy, black, cockatoo, inhabit, woodlands, rainforests, shrublands, and, even, alpine, forests, the, red, vented, cockatoo, inhabits, mangroves, and, its, absence, from, northern, luzon, may, be, related, to, the, lack, of, mangrove, forests, there, forest, dwelling, cockatoos, are, generally, sedentary, as, the, food, supply, is, more, stable, and, predictable, several, species, have, adapted, well, to, human, modified, habitats, and, are, found, in, agricultural, areas, and, even, busy, cities, cockatoos, are, diurnal, and, require, daylight, to, find, their, food, they, are, not, early, risers, instead, waiting, until, the, sun, has, warmed, their, roosting, sites, before, feeding, all, species, are, generally, highly, social, and, roost, forage, and, travel, in, colourful, and, noisy, flocks, these, vary, in, size, depending, on, availability, of, food, in, times, of, plenty, flocks, are, small, and, number, a, hundred, birds, or, less, while, in, droughts, or, other, times, of, adversity, they, may, swell, up, to, contain, thousands, or, even, tens, of, thousands, of, birds, one, record, from, the, kimberley, noted, a, flock, of, 32, 000, little, corellas, species, that, inhabit, open, country, form, larger, flocks, than, those, of, forested, areas, some, species, require, roosting, sites, that, are, located, near, drinking, sites, other, species, travel, great, distances, between, the, roosting, and, feeding, sites, cockatoos, have, several, characteristic, methods, of, bathing, they, may, hang, upside, down, or, fly, about, in, the, rain, or, flutter, in, wet, leaves, in, the, canopy, cockatoos, have, a, preferred, footedness, analogous, to, human, handedness, most, species, are, left, footed, with, 87, 100, of, individuals, using, their, left, feet, to, eat, but, a, few, species, favor, their, right, foot, cockatoos, are, monogamous, breeders, with, pair, bonds, that, can, last, many, years, many, birds, pair, up, in, flocks, before, they, reach, sexual, maturity, and, delay, breeding, for, a, year, at, least, females, breed, for, the, first, time, anywhere, from, three, to, seven, years, of, age, and, males, are, often, older, sexual, maturity, is, delayed, so, birds, can, develop, the, skills, for, raising, and, parenting, young, which, is, prolonged, compared, with, other, birds, the, young, of, some, species, remain, with, their, parents, for, up, to, a, year, cockatoos, may, also, display, site, fidelity, returning, to, the, same, nesting, sites, in, consecutive, years, courtship, is, generally, simple, particularly, for, established, pairs, with, the, black, cockatoos, alone, engaging, in, courtship, feeding, established, pairs, do, engage, in, preening, each, other, but, all, forms, of, courtship, drop, off, after, incubation, begins, possibly, due, to, the, strength, of, the, pair, bond, like, most, parrots, the, cockatoos, are, cavity, nesters, nesting, in, holes, in, trees, which, they, are, unable, to, excavate, themselves, these, hollows, are, formed, from, decay, or, destruction, of, wood, by, branches, breaking, off, fungi, or, insects, such, as, termites, or, even, woodpeckers, where, their, ranges, overlap, in, many, places, these, holes, are, scarce, and, the, source, of, competition, both, with, other, members, of, the, same, species, and, with, other, species, and, types, of, animal, in, general, cockatoos, choose, hollows, only, a, little, larger, than, themselves, hence, different, sized, species, nest, in, holes, of, corresponding, and, different, sizes, if, given, the, opportunity, cockatoos, prefer, nesting, over, 7, or, 8, metres, 23, or, 26, ft, above, the, ground, and, close, to, water, and, food, the, nesting, hollows, are, lined, with, sticks, wood, chips, and, branches, with, leaves, the, eggs, of, cockatoos, are, oval, and, initially, white, as, their, location, makes, camouflage, unnecessary, however, they, do, become, discoloured, over, the, course, of, incubation, they, range, in, size, from, 55, mm, 37, mm, 2, 2, in, 1, 5, in, in, the, palm, and, red, tailed, black, cockatoos, to, 26, mm, 19, mm, 1, 02, in, 0, 75, in, in, the, cockatiel, clutch, size, varies, within, the, family, with, the, palm, cockatoo, and, some, other, larger, cockatoos, laying, only, a, single, egg, and, the, smaller, species, laying, anywhere, between, two, and, eight, eggs, food, supply, also, plays, a, role, in, clutch, size, some, species, can, lay, a, second, clutch, if, the, first, fails, around, 20, of, eggs, laid, are, infertile, the, cockatoos, incubation, and, brooding, responsibilities, may, either, be, undertaken, by, the, female, alone, in, the, case, of, the, black, cockatoos, or, shared, amongst, the, sexes, as, happens, in, the, other, species, in, the, case, of, the, black, cockatoos, the, female, is, provisioned, by, the, male, several, times, a, day, the, young, of, all, species, are, born, covered, in, yellowish, down, bar, the, palm, cockatoo, whose, young, are, born, naked, cockatoo, incubation, times, are, dependent, on, species, size, with, the, smaller, cockatiels, having, a, period, of, around, 20, days, and, the, larger, carnaby, s, black, cockatoo, incubating, its, eggs, for, up, to, 29, days, the, nestling, period, also, varies, by, species, size, with, larger, species, having, longer, nestling, periods, it, is, also, affected, by, season, and, environmental, factors, and, by, competition, with, siblings, in, species, with, clutch, sizes, greater, than, one, much, of, what, is, known, about, the, nestling, period, of, some, species, is, dependent, on, aviary, studies, aviary, cockatiels, can, fledge, after, 5, weeks, and, the, large, palm, cockatoos, after, 11, weeks, during, this, period, the, young, become, covered, in, juvenile, plumage, while, remaining, in, the, hollow, wings, and, tail, feathers, are, slow, to, grow, initially, but, more, rapid, as, the, primary, feathers, appear, nestlings, quickly, reach, about, 80, 90, of, adult, weight, about, two, thirds, of, the, time, through, this, period, plateauing, before, they, leave, the, hollow, they, fledge, at, this, weight, with, wing, and, tail, feathers, still, to, grow, a, little, before, reaching, adult, dimensions, growth, rate, of, the, young, as, well, as, numbers, fledged, are, adversely, impacted, by, reduced, food, supply, and, poor, weather, conditions, cockatoos, are, versatile, feeders, and, consume, a, range, of, mainly, vegetable, food, items, seeds, form, a, large, part, of, the, diet, of, all, species, these, are, opened, with, their, large, and, powerful, bills, the, galahs, corellas, and, some, of, the, black, cockatoos, feed, primarily, on, the, ground, others, feed, mostly, in, trees, the, ground, feeding, species, tend, to, forage, in, flocks, which, form, tight, squabbling, groups, where, seeds, are, concentrated, and, dispersed, lines, where, food, is, more, sparsely, distributed, they, also, prefer, open, areas, where, visibility, is, good, the, western, and, long, billed, corellas, have, elongated, bills, to, excavate, tubers, and, roots, and, the, pink, cockatoo, walks, in, a, circle, around, the, doublegee, emex, australis, to, twist, out, and, remove, the, underground, parts, many, species, forage, for, food, in, the, canopy, of, trees, taking, advantage, of, serotiny, the, storage, of, a, large, supply, of, seed, in, cones, or, gumnuts, by, plant, genera, such, as, eucalyptus, banksia, and, hakea, a, natural, feature, of, the, australian, landscape, in, dryer, regions, these, woody, fruiting, bodies, are, inaccessible, to, many, species, and, harvested, in, the, main, by, parrots, cockatoos, and, rodents, in, more, tropical, regions, the, larger, cones, can, be, opened, by, the, large, bills, of, cockatoos, but, are, too, strong, for, smaller, animals, many, nuts, and, fruits, lie, on, the, end, of, small, branches, which, are, unable, to, support, the, weight, of, the, foraging, cockatoo, which, instead, bends, the, branch, towards, itself, and, holds, it, with, its, foot, while, some, cockatoos, are, generalists, taking, a, wide, range, of, foods, others, are, specialists, the, glossy, black, cockatoo, specialises, in, the, cones, of, trees, of, the, genus, allocasuarina, preferring, a, single, species, a, verticillata, it, holds, the, cones, in, its, foot, and, shreds, them, with, its, powerful, bill, before, removing, the, seeds, with, its, tongue, some, species, take, large, numbers, of, insects, particularly, when, breeding, in, fact, the, bulk, of, the, yellow, tailed, black, cockatoo, s, diet, is, made, up, of, insects, the, large, bill, is, used, in, order, to, extract, grubs, and, larvae, from, rotting, wood, the, amount, of, time, cockatoos, have, to, spend, foraging, varies, with, the, season, during, times, of, plenty, they, may, need, to, feed, for, only, a, few, hours, in, the, day, in, the, morning, and, evening, then, spend, the, rest, of, the, day, roosting, or, preening, in, trees, but, during, the, winter, most, of, the, day, may, be, spent, foraging, the, birds, have, increased, nutritional, requirements, during, the, breeding, season, so, they, spend, more, time, foraging, for, food, during, this, time, cockatoos, have, large, crops, which, allow, them, to, store, and, digest, food, for, some, time, after, retiring, to, a, tree, the, peregrine, falcon, and, little, eagle, have, been, reported, taking, galahs, and, the, wedge, tailed, eagle, has, been, observed, killing, a, sulphur, crested, cockatoo, eggs, and, nestlings, are, vulnerable, to, many, hazards, various, species, of, monitor, lizard, varanus, are, able, to, climb, trees, and, enter, hollows, other, predators, recorded, include, the, spotted, wood, owl, on, rasa, island, in, the, philippines, the, amethystine, python, black, butcherbird, and, rodents, including, the, giant, white, tailed, rat, in, cape, york, and,
