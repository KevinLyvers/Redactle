a, plasmid, is, a, small, extrachromosomal, dna, molecule, within, a, cell, that, is, physically, separated, from, chromosomal, dna, and, can, replicate, independently, they, are, most, commonly, found, as, small, circular, double, stranded, dna, molecules, in, bacteria, however, plasmids, are, sometimes, present, in, archaea, and, eukaryotic, organisms, plasmids, often, carry, useful, genes, such, as, for, antibiotic, resistance, while, chromosomes, are, large, and, contain, all, the, essential, genetic, information, for, living, under, normal, conditions, plasmids, are, usually, very, small, and, contain, additional, genes, for, special, circumstances, artificial, plasmids, are, widely, used, as, vectors, in, molecular, cloning, serving, to, drive, the, replication, of, recombinant, dna, sequences, within, host, organisms, in, the, laboratory, plasmids, may, be, introduced, into, a, cell, via, transformation, synthetic, plasmids, are, available, for, procurement, over, the, internet, plasmids, are, considered, replicons, units, of, dna, capable, of, replicating, autonomously, within, a, suitable, host, however, plasmids, like, viruses, are, not, generally, classified, as, life, plasmids, are, transmitted, from, one, bacterium, to, another, even, of, another, species, mostly, through, conjugation, this, host, to, host, transfer, of, genetic, material, is, one, mechanism, of, horizontal, gene, transfer, and, plasmids, are, considered, part, of, the, mobilome, unlike, viruses, which, encase, their, genetic, material, in, a, protective, protein, coat, called, a, capsid, plasmids, are, naked, dna, and, do, not, encode, genes, necessary, to, encase, the, genetic, material, for, transfer, to, a, new, host, however, some, classes, of, plasmids, encode, the, conjugative, sex, pilus, necessary, for, their, own, transfer, plasmids, vary, in, size, from, 1, to, over, 400, k, bp, and, the, number, of, identical, plasmids, in, a, single, cell, can, range, from, one, up, to, thousands, the, term, plasmid, was, introduced, in, 1952, by, the, american, molecular, biologist, joshua, lederberg, to, refer, to, any, extrachromosomal, hereditary, determinant, the, term, s, early, usage, included, any, bacterial, genetic, material, that, exists, extrachromosomally, for, at, least, part, of, its, replication, cycle, but, because, that, description, includes, bacterial, viruses, the, notion, of, plasmid, was, refined, over, time, to, refer, to, genetic, elements, that, reproduce, autonomously, later, in, 1968, it, was, decided, that, the, term, plasmid, should, be, adopted, as, the, term, for, extrachromosomal, genetic, element, and, to, distinguish, it, from, viruses, the, definition, was, narrowed, to, genetic, elements, that, exist, exclusively, or, predominantly, outside, of, the, chromosome, and, can, replicate, autonomously, in, order, for, plasmids, to, replicate, independently, within, a, cell, they, must, possess, a, stretch, of, dna, that, can, act, as, an, origin, of, replication, the, self, replicating, unit, in, this, case, the, plasmid, is, called, a, replicon, a, typical, bacterial, replicon, may, consist, of, a, number, of, elements, such, as, the, gene, for, plasmid, specific, replication, initiation, protein, rep, repeating, units, called, iterons, dnaa, boxes, and, an, adjacent, at, rich, region, smaller, plasmids, make, use, of, the, host, replicative, enzymes, to, make, copies, of, themselves, while, larger, plasmids, may, carry, genes, specific, for, the, replication, of, those, plasmids, a, few, types, of, plasmids, can, also, insert, into, the, host, chromosome, and, these, integrative, plasmids, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, episomes, in, prokaryotes, plasmids, almost, always, carry, at, least, one, gene, many, of, the, genes, carried, by, a, plasmid, are, beneficial, for, the, host, cells, for, example, enabling, the, host, cell, to, survive, in, an, environment, that, would, otherwise, be, lethal, or, restrictive, for, growth, some, of, these, genes, encode, traits, for, antibiotic, resistance, or, resistance, to, heavy, metal, while, others, may, produce, virulence, factors, that, enable, a, bacterium, to, colonize, a, host, and, overcome, its, defences, or, have, specific, metabolic, functions, that, allow, the, bacterium, to, utilize, a, particular, nutrient, including, the, ability, to, degrade, recalcitrant, or, toxic, organic, compounds, plasmids, can, also, provide, bacteria, with, the, ability, to, fix, nitrogen, some, plasmids, however, have, no, observable, effect, on, the, phenotype, of, the, host, cell, or, its, benefit, to, the, host, cells, cannot, be, determined, and, these, plasmids, are, called, cryptic, plasmids, naturally, occurring, plasmids, vary, greatly, in, their, physical, properties, their, size, can, range, from, very, small, mini, plasmids, of, less, than, 1, kilobase, pairs, kbp, to, very, large, megaplasmids, of, several, megabase, pairs, mbp, at, the, upper, end, little, differs, between, a, megaplasmid, and, a, minichromosome, plasmids, are, generally, circular, but, examples, of, linear, plasmids, are, also, known, these, linear, plasmids, require, specialized, mechanisms, to, replicate, their, ends, plasmids, may, be, present, in, an, individual, cell, in, varying, number, ranging, from, one, to, several, hundreds, the, normal, number, of, copies, of, plasmid, that, may, be, found, in, a, single, cell, is, called, the, plasmid, copy, number, and, is, determined, by, how, the, replication, initiation, is, regulated, and, the, size, of, the, molecule, larger, plasmids, tend, to, have, lower, copy, numbers, low, copy, number, plasmids, that, exist, only, as, one, or, a, few, copies, in, each, bacterium, are, upon, cell, division, in, danger, of, being, lost, in, one, of, the, segregating, bacteria, such, single, copy, plasmids, have, systems, that, attempt, to, actively, distribute, a, copy, to, both, daughter, cells, these, systems, which, include, the, parabs, system, and, parmrc, system, are, often, referred, to, as, the, partition, system, or, partition, function, of, a, plasmid, plasmids, of, linear, form, are, unknown, among, phytopathogens, with, one, exception, rhodococcus, fascians, plasmids, may, be, classified, in, a, number, of, ways, plasmids, can, be, broadly, classified, into, conjugative, plasmids, and, non, conjugative, plasmids, conjugative, plasmids, contain, a, set, of, transfer, genes, which, promote, sexual, conjugation, between, different, cells, in, the, complex, process, of, conjugation, plasmids, may, be, transferred, from, one, bacterium, to, another, via, sex, pili, encoded, by, some, of, the, transfer, genes, see, figure, non, conjugative, plasmids, are, incapable, of, initiating, conjugation, hence, they, can, be, transferred, only, with, the, assistance, of, conjugative, plasmids, an, intermediate, class, of, plasmids, are, mobilizable, and, carry, only, a, subset, of, the, genes, required, for, transfer, they, can, parasitize, a, conjugative, plasmid, transferring, at, high, frequency, only, in, its, presence, plasmids, can, also, be, classified, into, incompatibility, groups, a, microbe, can, harbour, different, types, of, plasmids, but, different, plasmids, can, only, exist, in, a, single, bacterial, cell, if, they, are, compatible, if, two, plasmids, are, not, compatible, one, or, the, other, will, be, rapidly, lost, from, the, cell, different, plasmids, may, therefore, be, assigned, to, different, incompatibility, groups, depending, on, whether, they, can, coexist, together, incompatible, plasmids, belonging, to, the, same, incompatibility, group, normally, share, the, same, replication, or, partition, mechanisms, and, can, thus, not, be, kept, together, in, a, single, cell, another, way, to, classify, plasmids, is, by, function, there, are, five, main, classes, plasmids, can, belong, to, more, than, one, of, these, functional, groups, although, most, plasmids, are, double, stranded, dna, molecules, some, consist, of, single, stranded, dna, or, predominantly, double, stranded, rna, rna, plasmids, are, non, infectious, extrachromosomal, linear, rna, replicons, both, encapsidated, and, unencapsidated, which, have, been, found, in, fungi, and, various, plants, from, algae, to, land, plants, in, many, cases, however, it, may, be, difficult, or, impossible, to, clearly, distinguish, rna, plasmids, from, rna, viruses, and, other, infectious, rnas, chromids, are, elements, that, exist, at, the, boundary, between, a, chromosome, and, a, plasmid, found, in, about, 10, of, bacterial, species, sequenced, by, 2009, these, elements, carry, core, genes, and, have, codon, usage, similar, to, the, chromosome, yet, use, a, plasmid, type, replication, mechanism, such, as, the, low, copy, number, repabc, as, a, result, they, have, been, variously, classified, as, minichromosomes, or, megaplasmids, in, the, past, in, vibrio, the, bacterium, synchronizes, the, replication, of, the, chromosome, and, chromid, by, a, conserved, genome, size, ratio, artificially, constructed, plasmids, may, be, used, as, vectors, in, genetic, engineering, these, plasmids, serve, as, important, tools, in, genetics, and, biotechnology, labs, where, they, are, commonly, used, to, clone, and, amplify, make, many, copies, of, or, express, particular, genes, a, wide, variety, of, plasmids, are, commercially, available, for, such, uses, the, gene, to, be, replicated, is, normally, inserted, into, a, plasmid, that, typically, contains, a, number, of, features, for, their, use, these, include, a, gene, that, confers, resistance, to, particular, antibiotics, ampicillin, is, most, frequently, used, for, bacterial, strains, an, origin, of, replication, to, allow, the, bacterial, cells, to, replicate, the, plasmid, dna, and, a, suitable, site, for, cloning, referred, to, as, a, multiple, cloning, site, dna, structural, instability, can, be, defined, as, a, series, of, spontaneous, events, that, culminate, in, an, unforeseen, rearrangement, loss, or, gain, of, genetic, material, such, events, are, frequently, triggered, by, the, transposition, of, mobile, elements, or, by, the, presence, of, unstable, elements, such, as, non, canonical, non, b, structures, accessory, regions, pertaining, to, the, bacterial, backbone, may, engage, in, a, wide, range, of, structural, instability, phenomena, well, known, catalysts, of, genetic, instability, include, direct, inverted, and, tandem, repeats, which, are, known, to, be, conspicuous, in, a, large, number, of, commercially, available, cloning, and, expression, vectors, insertion, sequences, can, also, severely, impact, plasmid, function, and, yield, by, leading, to, deletions, and, rearrangements, activation, down, regulation, or, inactivation, of, neighboring, gene, expression, therefore, the, reduction, or, complete, elimination, of, extraneous, noncoding, backbone, sequences, would, pointedly, reduce, the, propensity, for, such, events, to, take, place, and, consequently, the, overall, recombinogenic, potential, of, the, plasmid, plasmids, are, the, most, commonly, used, bacterial, cloning, vectors, these, cloning, vectors, contain, a, site, that, allows, dna, fragments, to, be, inserted, for, example, a, multiple, cloning, site, or, polylinker, which, has, several, commonly, used, restriction, sites, to, which, dna, fragments, may, be, ligated, after, the, gene, of, interest, is, inserted, the, plasmids, are, introduced, into, bacteria, by, a, process, called, transformation, these, plasmids, contain, a, selectable, marker, usually, an, antibiotic, resistance, gene, which, confers, on, the, bacteria, an, ability, to, survive, and, proliferate, in, a, selective, growth, medium, containing, the, particular, antibiotics, the, cells, after, transformation, are, exposed, to, the, selective, media, and, only, cells, containing, the, plasmid, may, survive, in, this, way, the, antibiotics, act, as, a, filter, to, select, only, the, bacteria, containing, the, plasmid, dna, the, vector, may, also, contain, other, marker, genes, or, reporter, genes, to, facilitate, selection, of, plasmids, with, cloned, inserts, bacteria, containing, the, plasmid, can, then, be, grown, in, large, amounts, harvested, and, the, plasmid, of, interest, may, then, be, isolated, using, various, methods, of, plasmid, preparation, a, plasmid, cloning, vector, is, typically, used, to, clone, dna, fragments, of, up, to, 15, kbp, to, clone, longer, lengths, of, dna, lambda, phage, with, lysogeny, genes, deleted, cosmids, bacterial, artificial, chromosomes, or, yeast, artificial, chromosomes, are, used, another, major, use, of, plasmids, is, to, make, large, amounts, of, proteins, in, this, case, researchers, grow, bacteria, containing, a, plasmid, harboring, the, gene, of, interest, just, as, the, bacterium, produces, proteins, to, confer, its, antibiotic, resistance, it, can, also, be, induced, to, produce, large, amounts, of, proteins, from, the, inserted, gene, this, is, a, cheap, and, easy, way, of, mass, producing, the, protein, the, gene, codes, for, for, example, insulin, plasmids, may, also, be, used, for, gene, transfer, as, a, potential, treatment, in, gene, therapy, so, that, it, may, express, the, protein, that, is, lacking, in, the, cells, some, forms, of, gene, therapy, require, the, insertion, of, therapeutic, genes, at, pre, selected, chromosomal, target, sites, within, the, human, genome, plasmid, vectors, are, one, of, many, approaches, that, could, be, used, for, this, purpose, zinc, finger, nucleases, zfns, offer, a, way, to, cause, a, site, specific, double, strand, break, to, the, dna, genome, and, cause, homologous, recombination, plasmids, encoding, zfn, could, help, deliver, a, therapeutic, gene, to, a, specific, site, so, that, cell, damage, cancer, causing, mutations, or, an, immune, response, is, avoided, plasmids, were, historically, used, to, genetically, engineer, the, embryonic, stem, cells, of, rats, to, create, rat, genetic, disease, models, the, limited, efficiency, of, plasmid, based, techniques, precluded, their, use, in, the, creation, of, more, accurate, human, cell, models, however, developments, in, adeno, associated, virus, recombination, techniques, and, zinc, finger, nucleases, have, enabled, the, creation, of, a, new, generation, of, isogenic, human, disease, models, the, term, episome, was, introduced, by, fran, ois, jacob, and, lie, wollman, in, 1958, to, refer, to, extra, chromosomal, genetic, material, that, may, replicate, autonomously, or, become, integrated, into, the, chromosome, since, the, term, was, introduced, however, its, use, has, changed, as, plasmid, has, become, the, preferred, term, for, autonomously, replicating, extrachromosomal, dna, at, a, 1968, symposium, in, london, some, participants, suggested, that, the, term, episome, be, abandoned, although, others, continued, to, use, the, term, with, a, shift, in, meaning, today, some, authors, use, episome, in, the, context, of, prokaryotes, to, refer, to, a, plasmid, that, is, capable, of, integrating, into, the, chromosome, the, integrative, plasmids, may, be, replicated, and, stably, maintained, in, a, cell, through, multiple, generations, but, at, some, stage, they, will, exist, as, an, independent, plasmid, molecule, in, the, context, of, eukaryotes, the, term, episome, is, used, to, mean, a, non, integrated, extrachromosomal, closed, circular, dna, molecule, that, may, be, replicated, in, the, nucleus, viruses, are, the, most, common, examples, of, this, such, as, herpesviruses, adenoviruses, and, polyomaviruses, but, some, are, plasmids, other, examples, include, aberrant, chromosomal, fragments, such, as, double, minute, chromosomes, that, can, arise, during, artificial, gene, amplifications, or, in, pathologic, processes, e, g, cancer, cell, transformation, episomes, in, eukaryotes, behave, similarly, to, plasmids, in, prokaryotes, in, that, the, dna, is, stably, maintained, and, replicated, with, the, host, cell, cytoplasmic, viral, episomes, as, in, poxvirus, infections, can, also, occur, some, episomes, such, as, herpesviruses, replicate, in, a, rolling, circle, mechanism, similar, to, bacteriophages, bacterial, phage, viruses, others, replicate, through, a, bidirectional, replication, mechanism, theta, type, plasmids, in, either, case, episomes, remain, physically, separate, from, host, cell, chromosomes, several, cancer, viruses, including, epstein, barr, virus, and, kaposi, s, sarcoma, associated, herpesvirus, are, maintained, as, latent, chromosomally, distinct, episomes, in, cancer, cells, where, the, viruses, express, oncogenes, that, promote, cancer, cell, proliferation, in, cancers, these, episomes, passively, replicate, together, with, host, chromosomes, when, the, cell, divides, when, these, viral, episomes, initiate, lytic, replication, to, generate, multiple, virus, particles, they, generally, activate, cellular, innate, immunity, defense, mechanisms, that, kill, the, host, cell, some, plasmids, or, microbial, hosts, include, an, addiction, system, or, postsegregational, killing, system, psk, such, as, the, hok, sok, host, killing, suppressor, of, killing, system, of, plasmid, r1, in, escherichia, coli, this, variant, produces, both, a, long, lived, poison, and, a, short, lived, antidote, several, types, of, plasmid, addiction, systems, toxin, antitoxin, metabolism, based, ort, systems, were, described, in, the, literature, and, used, in, biotechnical, fermentation, or, biomedical, vaccine, therapy, applications, daughter, cells, that, retain, a, copy, of, the, plasmid, survive, while, a, daughter, cell, that, fails, to, inherit, the, plasmid, dies, or, suffers, a, reduced, growth, rate, because, of, the, lingering, poison, from, the, parent, cell, finally, the, overall, productivity, could, be, enhanced, in, contrast, plasmids, used, in, biotechnology, such, as, puc18, pbr322, and, derived, vectors, hardly, ever, contain, toxin, antitoxin, addiction, systems, and, therefore, need, to, be, kept, under, antibiotic, pressure, to, avoid, plasmid, loss, yeasts, naturally, harbour, various, plasmids, notable, among, them, are, 2, m, plasmids, small, circular, plasmids, often, used, for, genetic, engineering, of, yeast, and, linear, pgkl, plasmids, from, kluyveromyces, lactis, that, are, responsible, for, killer, phenotypes, other, types, of, plasmids, are, often, related, to, yeast, cloning, vectors, that, include, the, mitochondria, of, many, higher, plants, contain, self, replicating, extra, chromosomal, linear, or, circular, dna, molecules, which, have, been, considered, to, be, plasmids, these, can, range, from, 0, 7, kb, to, 20, kb, in, size, the, plasmids, have, been, generally, classified, into, two, categories, circular, and, linear, circular, plasmids, have, been, isolated, and, found, in, many, different, plants, with, those, in, vicia, faba, and, chenopodium, album, being, the, most, studied, and, whose, mechanism, of, replication, is, known, the, circular, plasmids, can, replicate, using, the, model, of, replication, as, in, vicia, faba, and, through, rolling, circle, replication, as, in, c, album, linear, plasmids, have, been, identified, in, some, plant, species, such, as, beta, vulgaris, brassica, napus, zea, mays, etc, but, are, rarer, than, their, circular, counterparts, the, function, and, origin, of, these, plasmids, remains, largely, unknown, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, circular, plasmids, share, a, common, ancestor, some, genes, in, the, mitochondrial, plasmid, have, counterparts, in, the, nuclear, dna, suggesting, inter, compartment, exchange, meanwhile, the, linear, plasmids, share, structural, similarities, such, as, invertrons, with, viral, dna, and, fungal, plasmids, like, fungal, plasmids, they, also, have, low, gc, content, these, observations, have, led, to, some, hypothesizing, that, these, linear, plasmids, have, viral, origins, or, have, ended, up, in, plant, mitochondria, through, horizontal, gene, transfer, from, pathogenic, fungi, plasmids, are, often, used, to, purify, a, specific, sequence, since, they, can, easily, be, purified, away, from, the, rest, of, the, genome, for, their, use, as, vectors, and, for, molecular, cloning, plasmids, often, need, to, be, isolated, there, are, several, methods, to, isolate, plasmid, dna, from, bacteria, ranging, from, the, miniprep, to, the, maxiprep, or, bulkprep, the, former, can, be, used, to, quickly, find, out, whether, the, plasmid, is, correct, in, any, of, several, bacterial, clones, the, yield, is, a, small, amount, of, impure, plasmid, dna, which, is, sufficient, for, analysis, by, restriction, digest, and, for, some, cloning, techniques, in, the, latter, much, larger, volumes, of, bacterial, suspension, are, grown, from, which, a, maxi, prep, can, be, performed, in, essence, this, is, a, scaled, up, miniprep, followed, by, additional, purification, this, results, in, relatively, large, amounts, several, hundred, micrograms, of, very, pure, plasmid, dna, many, commercial, kits, have, been, created, to, perform, plasmid, extraction, at, various, scales, purity, and, levels, of, automation, plasmid, dna, may, appear, in, one, of, five, conformations, which, for, a, given, size, run, at, different, speeds, in, a, gel, during, electrophoresis, the, conformations, are, listed, below, in, order, of, electrophoretic, mobility, speed, for, a, given, applied, voltage, from, slowest, to, fastest, the, rate, of, migration, for, small, linear, fragments, is, directly, proportional, to, the, voltage, applied, at, low, voltages, at, higher, voltages, larger, fragments, migrate, at, continuously, increasing, yet, different, rates, thus, the, resolution, of, a, gel, decreases, with, increased, voltage, at, a, specified, low, voltage, the, migration, rate, of, small, linear, dna, fragments, is, a, function, of, their, length, large, linear, fragments, over, 20, kb, or, so, migrate, at, a, certain, fixed, rate, regardless, of, length, this, is, because, the, molecules, respirate, with, the, bulk, of, the, molecule, following, the, leading, end, through, the, gel, matrix, restriction, digests, are, frequently, used, to, analyse, purified, plasmids, these, enzymes, specifically, break, the, dna, at, certain, short, sequences, the, resulting, linear, fragments, form, bands, after, gel, electrophoresis, it, is, possible, to, purify, certain, fragments, by, cutting, the, bands, out, of, the, gel, and, dissolving, the, gel, to, release, the, dna, fragments, because, of, its, tight, conformation, supercoiled, dna, migrates, faster, through, a, gel, than, linear, or, open, circular, dna, the, use, of, plasmids, as, a, technique, in, molecular, biology, is, supported, by, bioinformatics, software, these, programs, record, the, dna, sequence, of, plasmid, vectors, help, to, predict, cut, sites, of, restriction, enzymes, and, to, plan, manipulations, examples, of, software, packages, that, handle, plasmid, maps, are, ape, clone, manager, geneconstructionkit, geneious, genome, compiler, labgenius, lasergene, macvector, pdraw32, serial, cloner, vectorfriends, vector, nti, and, webdsv, these, pieces, of, software, help, conduct, entire, experiments, in, silico, before, doing, wet, experiments, many, plasmids, have, been, created, over, the, years, and, researchers, have, given, out, plasmids, to, plasmid, databases, such, as, the, non, profit, organisations, addgene, and, bccm, lmbp, one, can, find, and, request, plasmids, from, those, databases, for, research, researchers, also, often, upload, plasmid, sequences, to, the, ncbi, database, from, which, sequences, of, specific, plasmids, can, be, retrieved
