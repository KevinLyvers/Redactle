cucurbita, latin, for, gourd, is, a, genus, of, herbaceous, fruits, in, the, gourd, family, cucurbitaceae, also, known, as, cucurbits, or, cucurbi, native, to, the, andes, and, mesoamerica, five, edible, species, are, grown, and, consumed, for, their, flesh, and, seeds, they, are, variously, known, as, squash, pumpkin, or, gourd, depending, on, species, variety, and, local, parlance, other, kinds, of, gourd, also, called, bottle, gourds, are, native, to, africa, and, belong, to, the, genus, lagenaria, which, is, in, the, same, family, and, subfamily, as, cucurbita, but, in, a, different, tribe, these, other, gourds, are, used, as, utensils, or, vessels, and, their, young, fruits, are, eaten, much, like, those, of, the, cucurbita, species, most, cucurbita, species, are, herbaceous, vines, that, grow, several, meters, in, length, and, have, tendrils, but, non, vining, bush, cultivars, of, c, pepo, and, c, maxima, have, also, been, developed, the, yellow, or, orange, flowers, on, a, cucurbita, plant, are, of, two, types, female, and, male, the, female, flowers, produce, the, fruit, and, the, male, flowers, produce, pollen, many, north, and, central, american, species, are, visited, by, specialist, bee, pollinators, but, other, insects, with, more, general, feeding, habits, such, as, honey, bees, also, visit, there, is, debate, about, the, taxonomy, of, the, genus, and, the, number, of, accepted, species, varies, from, 13, to, 30, the, five, domesticated, species, are, cucurbita, argyrosperma, c, ficifolia, c, maxima, c, moschata, and, c, pepo, all, of, which, can, be, treated, as, winter, squash, because, the, full, grown, fruits, can, be, stored, for, months, however, c, pepo, includes, some, cultivars, that, are, better, used, only, as, summer, squash, the, fruits, of, the, genus, cucurbita, are, good, sources, of, nutrients, such, as, vitamin, a, and, vitamin, c, among, other, nutrients, according, to, species, the, fruits, have, many, culinary, uses, including, pumpkin, pie, biscuits, bread, desserts, puddings, beverages, and, soups, although, botanical, fruits, cucurbita, gourds, such, as, squash, are, typically, cooked, and, eaten, as, vegetables, pumpkins, see, more, varied, use, and, are, eaten, both, as, vegetables, and, as, desserts, such, as, pumpkin, pie, cucurbita, species, fall, into, two, main, groups, the, first, group, consists, of, annual, or, short, lived, perennial, vines, which, are, mesophytic, meaning, they, require, a, more, or, less, continuous, water, supply, the, second, group, are, perennials, growing, in, arid, zones, which, are, xerophytic, meaning, they, tolerate, dry, conditions, cultivated, cucurbita, species, were, derived, from, the, first, group, growing, 5, to, 15, meters, 15, to, 50, feet, in, height, or, length, the, plant, stem, produces, tendrils, to, help, it, climb, adjacent, plants, and, structures, or, extend, along, the, ground, most, species, do, not, readily, root, from, the, nodes, a, notable, exception, is, c, ficifolia, and, the, four, other, cultivated, mesophytes, do, this, to, a, lesser, extent, the, vine, of, the, perennial, cucurbita, can, become, semiwoody, if, left, to, grow, there, is, wide, variation, in, size, shape, and, color, among, cucurbita, fruits, and, even, within, a, single, species, c, ficifolia, is, an, exception, being, highly, uniform, in, appearance, the, morphological, variation, in, the, species, c, pepo, and, c, maxima, is, so, vast, that, its, various, subspecies, and, cultivars, have, been, misidentified, as, totally, separate, species, the, typical, cultivated, cucurbita, species, has, five, lobed, or, palmately, divided, leaves, with, long, petioles, with, the, leaves, alternately, arranged, on, the, stem, the, stems, in, some, species, are, angular, all, of, the, above, ground, parts, may, be, hairy, with, various, types, of, trichomes, which, are, often, hardened, and, sharp, spring, like, tendrils, grow, from, each, node, and, are, branching, in, some, species, c, argyrosperma, has, ovate, cordate, egg, shaped, to, heart, shaped, leaves, the, shape, of, c, pepo, leaves, varies, widely, c, moschata, plants, can, have, light, or, dense, pubescence, c, ficifolia, leaves, are, slightly, angular, and, have, light, pubescence, the, leaves, of, all, four, of, these, species, may, or, may, not, have, white, spots, the, species, are, monoecious, with, unisexual, male, staminate, and, female, pistillate, flowers, on, a, single, plant, and, these, grow, singly, appearing, from, the, leaf, axils, flowers, have, five, fused, yellow, to, orange, petals, the, corolla, and, a, green, bell, shaped, calyx, male, flowers, in, cucurbitaceae, generally, have, five, stamens, but, in, cucurbita, there, are, only, three, and, their, anthers, are, joined, so, that, there, appears, to, be, one, female, flowers, have, thick, pedicels, and, an, inferior, ovary, with, 3, 5, stigmas, that, each, have, two, lobes, the, female, flowers, of, c, argyrosperma, and, c, ficifolia, have, larger, corollas, than, the, male, flowers, female, flowers, of, c, pepo, have, a, small, calyx, but, the, calyx, of, c, moschata, male, flowers, is, comparatively, short, cucurbita, fruits, are, large, and, fleshy, botanists, classify, the, cucurbita, fruit, as, a, pepo, which, is, a, special, type, of, berry, derived, from, an, inferior, ovary, with, a, thick, outer, wall, or, rind, with, hypanthium, tissue, forming, an, exocarp, around, the, ovary, and, a, fleshy, interior, composed, of, mesocarp, and, endocarp, the, term, pepo, is, used, primarily, for, cucurbitaceae, fruits, where, this, fruit, type, is, common, but, the, fruits, of, passiflora, and, carica, are, sometimes, also, pepos, the, seeds, which, are, attached, to, the, ovary, wall, parietal, placentation, and, not, to, the, center, are, large, and, fairly, flat, with, a, large, embryo, that, consists, almost, entirely, of, two, cotyledons, fruit, size, varies, considerably, wild, fruit, specimens, can, be, as, small, as, 4, centimeters, 1, 1, 2, inches, and, some, domesticated, specimens, can, weigh, well, over, 300, kilograms, 660, pounds, the, current, world, record, was, set, in, 2014, by, beni, meier, of, switzerland, with, a, 1, 054, kg, 2, 323, 7, lb, pumpkin, all, species, of, cucurbita, have, 20, pairs, of, chromosomes, many, north, and, central, american, species, are, visited, by, specialist, pollinators, in, the, apid, tribe, eucerini, especially, the, genera, peponapis, and, xenoglossa, and, these, squash, bees, can, be, crucial, to, the, flowers, producing, fruit, after, pollination, when, there, is, more, pollen, applied, to, the, stigma, more, seeds, are, produced, in, the, fruits, and, the, fruits, are, larger, with, greater, likelihood, of, maturation, an, effect, called, xenia, competitively, grown, specimens, are, therefore, often, hand, pollinated, to, maximize, the, number, of, seeds, in, the, fruit, which, increases, the, fruit, size, this, pollination, requires, skilled, technique, seedlessness, is, known, to, occur, in, certain, cultivars, of, c, pepo, the, most, critical, factors, in, flowering, and, fruit, set, are, physiological, having, to, do, with, the, age, of, the, plant, and, whether, it, already, has, developing, fruit, the, plant, hormones, ethylene, and, auxin, are, key, in, fruit, set, and, development, ethylene, promotes, the, production, of, female, flowers, when, a, plant, already, has, a, fruit, developing, subsequent, female, flowers, on, the, plant, are, less, likely, to, mature, a, phenomenon, called, first, fruit, dominance, and, male, flowers, are, more, frequent, an, effect, that, appears, due, to, reduced, natural, ethylene, production, within, the, plant, stem, ethephon, a, plant, growth, regulator, product, that, is, converted, to, ethylene, after, metabolism, by, the, plant, can, be, used, to, increase, fruit, and, seed, production, the, plant, hormone, gibberellin, produced, in, the, stamens, is, essential, for, the, development, of, all, parts, of, the, male, flowers, the, development, of, female, flowers, is, not, yet, understood, gibberellin, is, also, involved, in, other, developmental, processes, of, plants, such, as, seed, and, stem, growth, seeds, with, maximum, germination, potential, develop, in, c, moschata, by, 45, days, after, anthesis, and, seed, weight, reaches, its, maximum, 70, days, after, anthesis, some, varieties, of, c, pepo, germinate, best, with, eight, hours, of, sunlight, daily, and, a, planting, depth, of, 1, 2, centimeters, 1, 2, in, seeds, planted, deeper, than, 12, 5, centimeters, 5, in, are, not, likely, to, germinate, in, c, foetidissima, a, weedy, species, plants, younger, than, 19, days, old, are, not, able, to, sprout, from, the, roots, after, removing, the, shoots, in, a, seed, batch, with, 90, percent, germination, rate, over, 90, percent, of, the, plants, had, sprouted, after, 29, days, from, planting, experiments, have, shown, that, when, more, pollen, is, applied, to, the, stigma, as, well, as, the, fruit, containing, more, seeds, and, being, larger, the, xenia, effect, mentioned, above, the, germination, of, the, seeds, is, also, faster, and, more, likely, and, the, seedlings, are, larger, various, combinations, of, mineral, nutrients, and, light, have, a, significant, effect, during, the, various, stages, of, plant, growth, these, effects, vary, significantly, between, the, different, species, of, cucurbita, a, type, of, stored, phosphorus, called, phytate, forms, in, seed, tissues, as, spherical, crystalline, intrusions, in, protein, bodies, called, globoids, along, with, other, nutrients, phytate, is, used, completely, during, seedling, growth, heavy, metal, contamination, including, cadmium, has, a, significant, negative, impact, on, plant, growth, cucurbita, plants, grown, in, the, spring, tend, to, grow, larger, than, those, grown, in, the, autumn, cucurbita, was, formally, described, in, a, way, that, meets, the, requirements, of, modern, botanical, nomenclature, by, linnaeus, in, his, genera, plantarum, the, fifth, edition, of, 1754, in, conjunction, with, the, 1753, first, edition, of, species, plantarum, cucurbita, pepo, is, the, type, species, of, the, genus, linnaeus, initially, included, the, species, c, pepo, c, verrucosa, and, c, melopepo, both, now, included, in, c, pepo, as, well, as, c, citrullus, watermelon, now, citrullus, lanatus, and, c, lagenaria, now, lagenaria, siceraria, both, are, not, cucurbita, but, are, in, the, family, cucurbitaceae, the, cucurbita, digitata, c, foetidissima, c, galeotti, and, c, pedatifolia, species, groups, are, xerophytes, arid, zone, perennials, with, storage, roots, the, remainder, including, the, five, domesticated, species, are, all, mesophytic, annuals, or, short, life, perennials, with, no, storage, roots, the, five, domesticated, species, are, mostly, isolated, from, each, other, by, sterility, barriers, and, have, different, physiological, characteristics, some, cross, pollinations, can, occur, c, pepo, with, c, argyrosperma, and, c, moschata, and, c, maxima, with, c, moschata, cross, pollination, does, occur, readily, within, the, family, cucurbitaceae, the, buffalo, gourd, c, foetidissima, has, been, used, as, an, intermediary, as, it, can, be, crossed, with, all, the, common, cucurbita, various, taxonomic, treatments, have, been, proposed, for, cucurbita, ranging, from, 13, to, 30, species, in, 1990, cucurbita, expert, michael, nee, classified, them, into, the, following, oft, cited, 13, species, groups, 27, species, total, listed, by, group, and, alphabetically, with, geographic, origin, the, taxonomy, by, nee, closely, matches, the, species, groupings, reported, in, a, pair, of, studies, by, a, botanical, team, led, by, rhodes, and, bemis, in, 1968, and, 1970, based, on, statistical, groupings, of, several, phenotypic, traits, of, 21, species, seeds, for, studying, additional, species, members, were, not, available, sixteen, of, the, 21, species, were, grouped, into, five, clusters, with, the, remaining, five, being, classified, separately, the, full, phylogeny, of, this, genus, is, unknown, and, research, was, ongoing, in, 2014, the, following, cladogram, of, cucurbita, phylogeny, is, based, upon, a, 2002, study, of, mitochondrial, dna, by, sanjur, and, colleagues, sechium, edule, c, ficifolia, c, foetidissima, c, maxima, and, c, andreana, c, ecuadorensis, c, martinezii, c, pepo, subspp, fraterna, and, ovifera, c, pepo, subsp, pepo, c, sororia, in, part, c, moschata, c, sororia, in, part, and, c, argyrosperma, the, ancestral, species, of, the, genus, cucurbita, were, present, in, the, americas, before, the, arrival, of, humans, and, are, native, to, the, americas, the, likely, center, of, origin, is, southern, mexico, spreading, south, through, what, is, now, known, as, mesoamerica, into, south, america, and, north, to, what, is, now, the, southwestern, united, states, evolutionarily, speaking, the, genus, is, relatively, recent, in, origin, dating, back, to, the, holocene, whereas, the, family, cucurbitaceae, represented, in, bryonia, like, seeds, dates, to, the, paleocene, recent, genomic, studies, support, the, idea, that, the, cucurbita, genus, underwent, a, whole, genome, duplication, event, increasing, the, number, of, chromosomes, and, accelerating, the, rate, at, which, their, genomes, evolve, relative, to, other, cucurbits, no, species, within, the, genus, is, entirely, genetically, isolated, c, moschata, can, intercross, with, all, cucurbita, species, though, the, hybrid, offspring, may, not, be, fertile, unless, they, become, polyploid, evidence, of, domestication, of, cucurbita, goes, back, over, 8, 000, years, from, the, southernmost, parts, of, canada, down, to, argentina, and, chile, centers, of, domestication, stretch, from, the, mississippi, river, watershed, and, texas, down, through, mexico, and, central, america, to, northern, and, western, south, america, of, the, 27, species, that, nee, delineates, five, are, domesticated, four, of, these, c, argyrosperma, c, ficifolia, c, moschata, and, c, pepo, originated, and, were, domesticated, in, mesoamerica, the, fifth, c, maxima, originated, and, was, domesticated, in, south, america, within, c, pepo, the, pumpkins, the, scallops, and, possibly, the, crooknecks, are, ancient, and, were, domesticated, at, different, times, and, places, the, domesticated, forms, of, c, pepo, have, larger, fruits, than, non, domesticated, forms, and, seeds, that, are, larger, but, fewer, in, number, in, a, 1989, study, on, the, origins, and, development, of, c, pepo, botanist, harry, paris, suggested, that, the, original, wild, specimen, had, a, small, round, fruit, and, that, the, modern, pumpkin, is, its, direct, descendant, he, suggested, that, the, crookneck, ornamental, gourd, and, scallop, are, early, variants, and, that, the, acorn, squash, is, a, cross, between, the, scallop, and, the, pumpkin, c, argyrosperma, is, not, as, widespread, as, the, other, species, the, wild, form, c, a, subsp, sororia, is, found, from, mexico, to, nicaragua, and, cultivated, forms, are, used, in, a, somewhat, wider, area, stretching, from, panama, to, the, southeastern, united, states, it, was, probably, bred, for, its, seeds, which, are, large, and, high, in, oil, and, protein, but, its, flesh, is, of, poorer, quality, than, that, of, c, moschata, and, c, pepo, it, is, grown, in, a, wide, altitudinal, range, from, sea, level, to, as, high, as, 1, 800, meters, 5, 900, ft, in, dry, areas, usually, with, the, use, of, irrigation, or, in, areas, with, a, defined, rainy, season, where, seeds, are, sown, in, may, and, june, c, ficifolia, and, c, moschata, were, originally, thought, to, be, asiatic, in, origin, but, this, has, been, disproven, the, origin, of, c, ficifolia, is, latin, america, most, likely, southern, mexico, central, america, or, the, andes, it, grows, at, elevations, ranging, from, 1, 000, to, 3, 000, meters, 3, 300, to, 9, 800, ft, in, areas, with, heavy, rainfall, it, does, not, hybridize, well, with, other, cultivated, species, as, it, has, significantly, different, enzymes, and, chromosomes, c, maxima, originated, in, south, america, over, 4, 000, years, ago, probably, in, argentina, and, uruguay, the, plants, are, sensitive, to, frost, and, they, prefer, both, bright, sunlight, and, soil, with, a, ph, of, 6, 0, to, 7, 0, c, maxima, did, not, start, to, spread, into, north, america, until, after, the, arrival, of, columbus, varieties, were, in, use, by, native, peoples, of, the, united, states, by, the, 16th, century, types, of, c, maxima, include, triloba, zapallito, zipinka, banana, delicious, hubbard, marrow, c, maxima, marrow, show, and, turban, c, moschata, is, native, to, latin, america, but, the, precise, location, of, origin, is, uncertain, it, has, been, present, in, mexico, belize, guatemala, and, peru, for, 4, 000, 6, 000, years, and, has, spread, to, bolivia, ecuador, panama, puerto, rico, and, venezuela, this, species, is, closely, related, to, c, argyrosperma, a, variety, known, as, the, seminole, pumpkin, has, been, cultivated, in, florida, since, before, the, arrival, of, columbus, its, leaves, are, 20, to, 30, centimeters, 8, to, 12, in, wide, it, generally, grows, at, low, elevations, in, hot, climates, with, heavy, rainfall, but, some, varieties, have, been, found, above, 2, 200, meters, 7, 200, ft, groups, of, c, moschata, include, cheese, crookneck, c, moschata, and, bell, c, pepo, is, one, of, the, oldest, if, not, the, oldest, domesticated, species, with, the, oldest, known, locations, being, oaxaca, mexico, 8, 000, 10, 000, years, ago, and, ocampo, tamaulipas, mexico, about, 7, 000, years, ago, it, is, known, to, have, appeared, in, missouri, united, states, at, least, 4, 000, years, ago, debates, about, the, origin, of, c, pepo, have, been, on, going, since, at, least, 1857, there, have, traditionally, been, two, opposing, theories, about, its, origin, 1, that, it, is, a, direct, descendant, of, c, texana, and, 2, that, c, texana, is, merely, feral, c, pepo, a, more, recent, theory, by, botanist, thomas, andres, in, 1987, is, that, descendants, of, c, fraterna, hybridized, with, c, texana, resulting, in, two, distinct, domestication, events, in, two, different, areas, one, in, mexico, and, one, in, the, eastern, united, states, with, c, fraterna, and, c, texana, respectively, as, the, ancestral, species, c, pepo, may, have, appeared, in, the, old, world, before, moving, from, mexico, into, south, america, it, is, found, from, sea, level, to, slightly, above, 2, 000, meters, 6, 600, ft, leaves, have, 3, 5, lobes, and, are, 20, 35, centimeters, 8, 14, in, wide, all, the, subspecies, varieties, and, cultivars, are, interfertile, in, 1986, paris, proposed, a, revised, taxonomy, of, the, edible, cultivated, c, pepo, based, primarily, on, the, shape, of, the, fruit, with, eight, groups, all, but, a, few, c, pepo, cultivars, can, be, included, in, these, groups, there, is, one, non, edible, cultivated, variety, c, pepo, var, ovifera, cucurbita, species, are, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, species, including, the, cabbage, moth, mamestra, brassicae, hypercompe, indecisa, and, the, turnip, moth, agrotis, segetum, cucurbita, can, be, susceptible, to, the, pest, bemisia, argentifolii, silverleaf, whitefly,

these, viruses, that, does, not, affect, all, cucurbits, sqmv, and, cmv, are, the, most, common, viruses, among, cucurbits, symptoms, of, these, viruses, show, a, high, degree, of, similarity, which, often, results, in, laboratory, investigation, being, needed, to, differentiate, which, one, is, affecting, plants, the, genus, was, part, of, the, culture, of, almost, every, native, peoples, group, from, southern, south, america, to, southern, canada, modern, day, cultivated, cucurbita, are, not, found, in, the, wild, genetic, studies, of, the, mitochondrial, gene, nad1, show, there, were, at, least, six, independent, domestication, events, of, cucurbita, separating, domestic, species, from, their, wild, ancestors, species, native, to, north, america, include, c, digitata, calabazilla, and, c, foetidissima, buffalo, gourd, c, palmata, coyote, melon, and, c, pepo, some, species, such, as, c, digitata, and, c, ficifolia, are, referred, to, as, gourds, gourds, also, called, bottle, gourds, which, are, used, as, utensils, or, vessels, belong, to, the, genus, lagenaria, and, are, native, to, africa, lagenaria, are, in, the, same, family, and, subfamily, as, cucurbita, but, in, a, different, tribe, the, earliest, known, evidence, of, the, domestication, of, cucurbita, dates, back, at, least, 8, 000, years, ago, predating, the, domestication, of, other, crops, such, as, maize, and, beans, in, the, region, by, about, 4, 000, years, this, evidence, was, found, in, the, guil, naquitz, cave, in, oaxaca, mexico, during, a, series, of, excavations, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, possibly, beginning, in, 1959, solid, evidence, of, domesticated, c, pepo, was, found, in, the, guil, naquitz, cave, in, the, form, of, increasing, rind, thickness, and, larger, peduncles, in, the, newer, stratification, layers, of, the, cave, by, c, 8, 000, years, bp, the, c, pepo, peduncles, found, are, consistently, more, than, 10, millimeters, 3, 8, in, thick, wild, cucurbita, peduncles, are, always, below, this, 10, mm, barrier, changes, in, fruit, shape, and, color, indicate, that, intentional, breeding, of, c, pepo, had, occurred, by, no, later, than, 8, 000, years, bp, during, the, same, time, frame, average, rind, thickness, increased, from, 0, 84, 1, 15, millimeters, 1, 32, 3, 64, in, recent, genomic, studies, suggest, that, cucurbita, argyrosperma, was, domesticated, in, mexico, in, the, region, that, is, currently, known, as, the, state, of, jalisco, squash, was, domesticated, first, followed, by, maize, and, then, beans, becoming, part, of, the, three, sisters, agricultural, system, of, companion, planting, the, english, word, squash, derives, from, askutasquash, a, green, thing, eaten, raw, a, word, from, the, narragansett, language, which, was, documented, by, roger, williams, the, founder, of, rhode, island, in, his, 1643, publication, a, key, into, the, language, of, america, similar, words, for, squash, exist, in, related, languages, of, the, algonquian, family, in, 2021, world, production, of, squashes, including, gourds, and, pumpkins, was, 23, 4, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 32, of, the, total, table, ukraine, russia, and,
