the, guinea, pig, or, domestic, guinea, pig, cavia, porcellus, also, known, as, the, cavy, or, domestic, cavy, k, e, v, i, kay, vee, is, a, species, of, rodent, belonging, to, the, genus, cavia, family, caviidae, breeders, tend, to, use, the, name, cavy, for, the, animal, but, guinea, pig, is, more, commonly, used, in, scientific, and, laboratory, contexts, despite, their, name, guinea, pigs, are, not, native, to, guinea, nor, are, they, closely, related, to, pigs, instead, they, originated, in, the, andes, region, of, south, america, where, wild, guinea, pigs, can, still, be, found, today, studies, based, on, biochemistry, and, dna, hybridization, suggest, they, are, domesticated, animals, that, do, not, exist, naturally, in, the, wild, but, are, descendants, of, a, closely, related, cavy, species, such, as, c, tschudii, originally, they, were, domesticated, as, livestock, source, of, meat, at, the, andean, region, and, are, still, consumed, in, some, parts, of, the, world, in, western, society, the, guinea, pig, has, enjoyed, widespread, popularity, as, a, pet, since, its, introduction, to, europe, and, north, america, by, european, traders, in, the, 16th, century, their, docile, nature, friendly, responsiveness, to, handling, and, feeding, and, the, relative, ease, of, caring, for, them, have, continued, to, make, guinea, pigs, a, popular, choice, of, household, pets, consequently, organizations, devoted, to, the, competitive, breeding, of, guinea, pigs, have, been, formed, worldwide, through, artificial, selection, many, specialized, breeds, with, varying, coat, colors, and, textures, have, been, selected, by, breeders, livestock, breeds, of, guinea, pig, play, an, important, role, in, folk, culture, for, many, indigenous, andean, peoples, especially, as, a, food, source, they, are, not, only, used, in, folk, medicine, and, in, community, religious, ceremonies, but, also, raised, for, their, meat, guinea, pigs, are, an, important, culinary, staple, in, the, andes, mountains, where, it, is, known, as, cuy, lately, marketers, tried, to, increase, their, consumption, outside, south, america, biological, experimentation, on, domestic, guinea, pigs, has, been, carried, out, since, the, 17th, century, the, animals, were, used, so, frequently, as, model, organisms, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, that, the, epithet, guinea, pig, came, into, use, to, describe, a, human, test, subject, since, that, time, they, have, mainly, been, replaced, by, other, rodents, such, as, mice, and, rats, however, they, are, still, used, in, research, primarily, as, models, to, study, such, human, medical, conditions, as, juvenile, diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy, like, humans, they, require, dietary, intake, of, vitamin, c, and, pregnancy, complications, cavia, porcellus, is, not, found, naturally, in, the, wild, it, is, likely, descended, from, closely, related, species, of, cavies, such, as, c, aperea, c, fulgida, and, c, tschudii, these, closely, related, species, are, still, commonly, found, in, various, regions, of, south, america, studies, from, 2007, to, 2010, applying, molecular, markers, and, morphometric, studies, on, the, skull, and, skeletal, morphology, of, current, and, mummified, animals, revealed, the, ancestor, to, be, most, likely, c, tschudii, some, species, of, cavy, identified, in, the, 20th, century, as, c, anolaimae, and, c, guianae, may, be, domestic, guinea, pigs, that, have, become, feral, by, reintroduction, into, the, wild, regionally, known, as, cuy, spanish, word, derived, from, quechua, quwi, the, guinea, pig, was, first, domesticated, as, early, as, 5000, bc, for, food, by, tribes, in, the, andean, region, of, south, america, the, present, day, southern, part, of, colombia, ecuador, peru, and, bolivia, some, thousands, years, after, the, domestication, of, the, south, american, camelids, the, moche, people, of, ancient, peru, worshipped, animals, and, often, depicted, the, guinea, pig, in, their, art, early, accounts, from, spanish, settlers, state, that, guinea, pigs, were, the, preferred, sacrificial, animal, of, the, inca, people, native, to, peru, these, claims, are, supported, by, archaeological, digs, and, transcribed, quechua, mythology, providing, evidence, that, sacrificial, rituals, involving, guinea, pigs, served, many, purposes, in, society, such, as, appeasing, the, gods, accompanying, the, dead, or, reading, the, future, from, about, 1200, to, the, spanish, conquest, in, 1532, the, indigenous, people, used, selective, breeding, to, develop, many, varieties, of, domestic, guinea, pigs, forming, the, basis, for, some, modern, domestic, breeds, they, continue, to, be, a, food, source, in, the, region, many, households, in, the, andean, highlands, raise, the, animal, in, the, early, 1500s, spanish, dutch, and, english, traders, took, guinea, pigs, to, europe, where, they, quickly, became, popular, as, exotic, pets, among, the, upper, classes, and, royalty, including, queen, elizabeth, i, the, earliest, known, written, account, of, the, guinea, pig, dates, from, 1547, in, a, description, of, the, animal, from, santo, domingo, because, cavies, are, not, native, to, hispaniola, the, animal, was, believed, to, have, been, earlier, introduced, there, by, spanish, travelers, however, based, on, more, recent, excavations, on, west, indian, islands, the, animal, must, have, been, introduced, to, the, caribbean, around, 500, bc, by, ceramic, making, horticulturalists, from, south, america, it, was, present, in, the, ostionoid, period, on, puerto, rico, for, example, long, before, the, advent, of, the, spaniards, the, guinea, pig, was, first, described, in, the, west, in, 1554, by, the, swiss, naturalist, conrad, gessner, its, binomial, scientific, name, was, first, used, by, erxleben, in, 1777, it, is, an, amalgam, of, pallas, generic, designation, 1766, and, linnaeus, specific, conferral, 1758, the, earliest, known, european, illustration, of, a, domestic, guinea, pig, is, a, painting, artist, unknown, in, the, collection, of, the, national, portrait, gallery, in, london, dated, to, 1580, which, shows, a, girl, in, a, typical, elizabethan, dress, holding, a, tortoise, shell, guinea, pig, in, her, hands, she, is, flanked, by, her, two, brothers, one, of, whom, holds, a, pet, bird, the, picture, dates, from, the, same, period, as, the, oldest, recorded, guinea, pig, remains, in, england, which, are, a, partial, cavy, skeleton, found, at, hill, hall, an, elizabethan, manor, house, in, essex, and, dated, to, around, 1575, the, scientific, name, of, the, common, species, is, cavia, porcellus, with, porcellus, being, latin, for, little, pig, cavia, is, neo, latin, it, is, derived, from, cabiai, the, animal, s, name, in, the, language, of, the, galibi, tribes, once, native, to, french, guiana, cabiai, may, be, an, adaptation, of, the, portuguese, avia, now, savia, which, is, itself, derived, from, the, tupi, word, sauj, meaning, rat, the, origin, of, guinea, in, guinea, pig, is, hard, to, explain, one, proposed, explanation, is, that, the, animals, were, brought, to, europe, by, way, of, guinea, leading, people, to, think, they, had, originated, there, guinea, was, also, frequently, used, in, english, to, refer, generally, to, any, far, off, unknown, country, so, the, name, may, be, a, colorful, reference, to, the, animal, s, exotic, origins, another, hypothesis, suggests, the, guinea, in, the, name, is, a, corruption, of, guiana, an, area, in, south, america, a, common, misconception, is, that, they, were, so, named, because, they, were, sold, for, the, price, of, a, guinea, coin, this, hypothesis, is, untenable, because, the, guinea, was, first, struck, in, england, in, 1663, and, william, harvey, used, the, term, ginny, pig, as, early, as, 1653, others, believe, guinea, may, be, an, alteration, of, the, word, coney, rabbit, guinea, pigs, were, referred, to, as, pig, coneys, in, edward, topsell, s, 1607, treatise, on, quadrupeds, how, the, animals, came, to, be, called, pigs, is, not, clear, they, are, built, somewhat, like, pigs, with, large, heads, relative, to, their, bodies, stout, necks, and, rounded, rumps, with, no, tail, of, any, consequence, some, of, the, sounds, they, emit, are, very, similar, to, those, made, by, pigs, and, they, spend, a, large, amount, of, time, eating, they, can, survive, for, long, periods, in, small, quarters, like, a, pig, pen, and, were, easily, transported, by, ship, to, europe, guinea, pigs, are, called, quwi, or, jaca, in, quechua, and, cuy, or, cuyo, plural, cuyes, cuyos, in, the, spanish, of, ecuador, peru, and, bolivia, the, animal, s, name, alludes, to, pigs, in, many, european, languages, the, german, word, for, them, is, meerschweinchen, literally, little, sea, pig, in, polish, they, are, called, winka, morska, in, hungarian, as, tengerimalac, and, in, russian, romanized, morskaya, svinka, the, german, word, derives, from, the, middle, high, german, name, merswin, this, word, originally, meant, dolphin, and, was, used, because, of, the, animals, grunting, sounds, which, were, thought, to, be, similar, many, other, possibly, less, scientifically, based, explanations, of, the, german, name, exist, for, example, sailing, ships, stopping, to, reprovision, in, the, new, world, would, pick, up, guinea, pig, stores, providing, an, easily, transportable, source, of, fresh, meat, the, french, term, is, cochon, d, inde, indian, pig, or, cobaye, the, dutch, called, it, guinees, biggetje, guinean, piglet, or, cavia, in, some, dutch, dialects, it, is, called, spaanse, rat, and, in, portuguese, the, guinea, pig, is, variously, referred, to, as, cobaia, from, the, tupi, word, via, its, latinization, or, as, porquinho, da, ndia, little, indian, pig, this, association, with, pigs, is, not, universal, among, european, terms, for, example, the, common, word, in, spanish, is, conejillo, de, indias, little, rabbit, of, the, indies, the, chinese, refer, to, the, animal, as, t, nsh, pig, mouse, and, sometimes, as, h, l, nzh, netherlands, pig, or, ti, nzh, sh, indian, mouse, the, japanese, word, for, guinea, pig, is, morumotto, which, derives, from, the, name, of, another, mountain, dwelling, rodent, the, marmot, this, word, is, how, the, guinea, pigs, were, called, by, dutch, traders, who, first, brought, them, to, nagasaki, in, 1843, the, other, and, less, common, japanese, word, for, guinea, pig, using, kanji, is, or, tenjiku, nezumi, which, translates, as, india, rat, guinea, pigs, are, relatively, large, for, rodents, in, pet, breeds, adults, typically, weigh, between, 700, and, 1, 200, g, 1, 5, and, 2, 6, lb, and, measure, between, 20, and, 25, cm, 8, and, 10, in, in, length, some, livestock, breeds, weigh, 3, kg, 6, 6, lb, when, full, grown, pet, breeds, live, an, average, of, four, to, five, years, but, may, live, as, long, as, eight, years, according, to, guinness, world, records, as, of, 2006, the, longest, lived, guinea, pig, was, 14, years, 10, months, and, 2, weeks, old, most, guinea, pigs, have, fur, but, one, laboratory, breed, adopted, by, some, pet, owners, the, skinny, pig, is, mostly, furless, in, contrast, several, breeds, have, long, fur, such, as, the, peruvian, the, silkie, and, the, texel, they, have, four, front, teeth, and, small, back, teeth, their, front, teeth, grow, continuously, so, guinea, pigs, chew, on, materials, such, as, wood, to, wear, them, down, to, prevent, them, from, becoming, too, long, in, the, 1990s, a, minority, scientific, opinion, emerged, proposing, that, caviomorphs, such, as, guinea, pigs, chinchillas, and, degus, are, not, actually, rodents, and, should, be, reclassified, as, a, separate, order, of, mammals, similar, to, the, rodent, like, lagomorphs, which, includes, rabbits, and, hares, subsequent, research, using, wider, sampling, restored, the, consensus, among, mammalian, biologists, regarding, the, current, classification, of, rodents, including, guinea, pigs, as, monophyletic, wild, cavies, are, found, on, grassy, plains, and, occupy, an, ecological, niche, similar, to, that, of, cattle, they, are, social, animals, living, in, the, wild, in, small, groups, herds, that, consist, of, several, females, sows, a, male, boar, and, their, young, pups, not, piglets, a, break, with, the, preceding, porcine, nomenclature, herds, of, animals, move, together, eating, grass, or, other, vegetation, yet, do, not, store, food, while, they, do, not, burrow, themselves, or, build, nests, they, frequently, seek, shelter, in, the, burrows, of, other, animals, as, well, as, in, crevices, and, tunnels, formed, by, vegetation, they, are, crepuscular, and, tend, to, be, most, active, during, dawn, and, dusk, when, it, is, harder, for, predators, to, spot, them, male, and, female, guinea, pigs, do, not, significantly, differ, in, appearance, apart, from, general, size, the, position, of, the, anus, is, very, close, to, the, genitals, in, both, sexes, sexing, animals, at, a, young, age, must, be, done, by, someone, trained, in, the, differences, female, genitals, are, distinguished, by, a, y, shaped, configuration, formed, from, a, vulvar, flap, while, male, genitals, may, look, similar, with, the, penis, and, anus, forming, a, similar, shape, the, penis, will, protrude, if, pressure, is, applied, to, the, surrounding, hair, anterior, to, the, genital, region, the, male, s, testes, may, also, be, visible, externally, from, scrotal, swelling, guinea, pigs, can, learn, complex, paths, to, food, and, can, accurately, remember, a, learned, path, for, months, their, most, robust, problem, solving, strategy, is, motion, while, guinea, pigs, can, jump, small, obstacles, they, cannot, jump, very, high, most, of, them, are, poor, climbers, and, are, not, particularly, agile, they, startle, easily, and, when, they, sense, danger, they, either, freeze, in, place, for, long, periods, or, run, for, cover, with, rapid, darting, motions, larger, groups, of, startled, guinea, pigs, stampede, running, in, haphazard, directions, as, a, means, of, confusing, predators, when, happily, excited, guinea, pigs, may, often, repeatedly, perform, little, hops, in, the, air, a, movement, known, as, popcorning, analogous, to, the, ferret, s, war, dance, or, rabbit, happy, hops, binkies, guinea, pigs, are, also, good, swimmers, although, they, do, not, like, being, wet, and, infrequently, need, bathing, like, many, rodents, guinea, pigs, sometimes, participate, in, social, grooming, and, regularly, self, groom, a, milky, white, substance, is, secreted, from, their, eyes, and, rubbed, into, the, hair, during, the, grooming, process, groups, of, boars, often, chew, each, other, s, hair, but, this, is, a, method, of, establishing, hierarchy, within, a, group, rather, than, a, social, gesture, dominance, is, also, established, through, biting, especially, of, the, ears, piloerection, aggressive, noises, head, thrusts, and, leaping, attacks, non, sexual, simulated, mounting, for, dominance, is, also, common, among, same, sex, groups, guinea, pig, eyesight, is, not, as, good, as, that, of, a, human, in, terms, of, distance, and, color, but, they, have, a, wider, angle, of, vision, about, 340, and, see, in, partial, color, dichromacy, they, have, well, developed, senses, of, hearing, smell, and, touch, guinea, pigs, have, developed, a, different, biological, rhythm, from, their, wild, counterparts, and, have, longer, periods, of, activity, followed, by, short, sleep, in, between, activity, is, scattered, randomly, throughout, the, day, aside, from, an, avoidance, of, intense, light, no, regular, circadian, patterns, are, apparent, guinea, pigs, do, not, generally, thrive, when, housed, with, other, species, larger, animals, may, regard, guinea, pigs, as, prey, though, some, dogs, and, cats, can, be, trained, to, accept, them, opinion, is, divided, over, the, cohousing, of, guinea, pigs, and, rabbits, some, published, sources, say, that, guinea, pigs, and, rabbits, complement, each, other, well, when, sharing, a, cage, however, rabbits, have, different, nutritional, requirements, as, lagomorphs, they, synthesize, their, own, vitamin, c, so, the, two, species, will, not, thrive, if, fed, the, same, food, when, housed, together, rabbits, may, also, harbor, diseases, such, as, respiratory, infections, from, bordetella, and, pasteurella, to, which, guinea, pigs, are, susceptible, housing, guinea, pigs, with, other, rodents, such, as, gerbils, and, hamsters, may, increase, instances, of, respiratory, and, other, infections, and, such, rodents, may, act, aggressively, toward, guinea, pigs, vocalization, is, the, primary, means, of, communication, between, members, of, the, species, these, are, the, most, common, sounds, made, by, the, guinea, pig, males, boars, reach, sexual, maturity, in, 3, 5, weeks, similarly, females, sows, can, be, fertile, as, early, as, four, weeks, old, and, carry, litters, before, becoming, fully, grown, adults, a, sow, can, breed, year, round, with, spring, being, the, peak, a, sow, can, have, as, many, as, five, litters, in, a, year, but, six, is, theoretically, possible, unlike, the, offspring, of, most, rodents, which, are, altricial, at, birth, newborn, cavy, pups, are, precocial, and, are, well, developed, with, hair, teeth, claws, and, partial, eyesight, the, pups, are, immediately, mobile, and, begin, eating, solid, food, immediately, though, they, continue, to, suckle, sows, can, once, again, become, pregnant, 6, 48, hours, after, giving, birth, but, it, is, not, healthy, for, a, female, to, be, constantly, pregnant, the, gestation, period, lasts, from, 59, 72, days, 1, 9, 2, 4, months, with, an, average, of, 63, 68, days, 2, 1, 2, 2, months, because, of, the, long, gestation, period, and, the, large, size, of, the, pups, pregnant, sows, may, become, large, and, eggplant, shaped, although, the, change, in, size, and, shape, varies, depending, upon, the, size, of, the, litter, litter, size, ranges, from, one, to, six, with, three, being, the, average, the, largest, recorded, litter, size, is, 9, the, guinea, pig, mother, only, has, two, nipples, but, she, can, readily, raise, the, more, average, sized, litters, of, 2, to, 4, pups, in, smaller, litters, difficulties, may, occur, during, labour, due, to, oversized, pups, large, litters, result, in, higher, incidences, of, stillbirth, but, because, the, pups, are, delivered, at, an, advanced, stage, of, development, lack, of, access, to, the, mother, s, milk, has, little, effect, on, the, mortality, rate, of, newborns, cohabitating, females, assist, in, mothering, duties, if, lactating, guinea, pigs, practice, alloparental, care, in, which, a, sow, may, adopt, the, pups, of, another, this, might, take, place, if, the, original, parents, die, or, are, for, some, reason, separated, from, them, this, behavior, is, common, and, is, seen, in, many, other, animal, species, such, as, the, elephant, toxemia, of, pregnancy, hypertension, is, a, common, problem, and, kills, many, pregnant, females, signs, of, toxemia, include, anorexia, loss, of, appetite, lack, of, energy, excessive, salivation, a, sweet, or, fruity, breath, odor, due, to, ketones, and, seizures, in, advanced, cases, pregnancy, toxemia, appears, to, be, most, common, in, hot, climates, other, serious, complications, during, pregnancy, can, include, a, prolapsed, uterus, hypocalcaemia, and, mastitis, females, that, do, not, give, birth, may, develop, an, irreversible, fusing, or, calcified, cartilage, of, the, pubic, symphysis, a, joint, in, the, pelvis, which, may, occur, after, six, months, of, age, 72, 73, if, they, become, pregnant, after, this, has, happened, the, birth, canal, may, not, widen, sufficiently, which, may, lead, to, dystocia, and, death, as, they, attempt, to, give, birth, domestic, guinea, pigs, generally, live, in, cages, although, some, owners, of, large, numbers, of, cavies, dedicate, entire, rooms, to, their, pets, wire, mesh, floors, can, cause, injury, and, may, be, associated, with, an, infection, commonly, known, as, bumblefoot, ulcerative, pododermatitis, so, cages, with, solid, bottoms, where, the, animal, walks, directly, on, the, bedding, are, typically, used, large, cages, allow, for, adequate, running, space, and, can, be, constructed, from, wire, grid, panels, and, plastic, sheeting, a, style, known, as, c, c, or, cubes, and, coroplast, red, cedar, eastern, or, western, and, pine, both, softwoods, were, commonly, used, as, bedding, still, these, materials, are, believed, to, contain, harmful, phenols, aromatic, hydrocarbons, and, oils, bedding, materials, made, from, hardwoods, such, as, aspen, paper, products, and, corn, cobs, are, alternatives, guinea, pigs, tend, to, be, messy, they, often, jump, into, their, food, bowls, or, kick, bedding, and, feces, into, them, and, their, urine, sometimes, crystallizes, on, cage, surfaces, making, it, difficult, to, remove, after, its, cage, has, been, cleaned, a, guinea, pig, typically, urinates, and, drags, its, lower, body, across, the, floor, of, the, cage, to, mark, its, territory, male, guinea, pigs, may, mark, their, territory, in, this, way, when, they, are, put, back, into, their, cages, after, being, taken, out, guinea, pigs, thrive, in, groups, of, two, or, more, groups, of, sows, or, groups, of, one, or, more, sows, and, a, neutered, boar, are, common, combinations, but, boars, can, sometimes, live, together, guinea, pigs, learn, to, recognize, and, bond, with, other, individual, guinea, pigs, and, tests, show, that, a, boar, s, neuroendocrine, stress, response, to, a, strange, environment, is, significantly, lowered, in, the, presence, of, a, bonded, female, but, not, with, unfamiliar, females, groups, of, boars, may, also, get, along, provided, their, cage, has, enough, space, they, are, introduced, at, an, early, age, and, no, females, are, present, in, switzerland, where, owning, a, single, guinea, pig, is, considered, harmful, to, its, well, being, keeping, a, guinea, pig, without, a, companion, is, illegal, there, is, a, service, to, rent, guinea, pigs, to, temporarily, replace, a, dead, cage, mate, sweden, has, similar, laws, against, keeping, a, guinea, pig, by, itself, the, guinea, pig, s, natural, diet, is, grass, their, molars, are, particularly, suited, for, grinding, plant, matter, and, grow, continuously, throughout, their, life, most, mammals, that, graze, are, large, and, have, a, long, digestive, tract, guinea, pigs, have, much, longer, colons, than, most, rodents, easily, digestible, food, is, processed, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, and, expelled, as, regular, feces, but, to, get, nutrients, out, of, hard, to, digest, fiber, guinea, pigs, ferment, fiber, in, the, cecum, in, the, gi, tract, and, then, expel, the, contents, as, cecotropes, which, are, reingested, cecotrophy, the, cecotropes, are, then, absorbed, in, the, small, intestine, to, utilize, the, nutrients, the, cecotropes, are, eaten, directly, from, the, anus, unless, the, guinea, pig, is, pregnant, or, obese, they, share, this, behavior, with, lagomorphs, rabbits, hares, pikas, and, some, other, animals, in, geriatric, boars, or, sows, rarely, in, young, ones, the, muscles, which, allow, the, cecotropes, to, be, expelled, from, the, anus, can, become, weak, this, creates, a, condition, known, as, fecal, impaction, which, prevents, the, animal, from, redigesting, cecotropes, even, though, harder, pellets, may, pass, through, the, impacted, mass, the, condition, may, be, temporarily, alleviated, by, a, human, carefully, removing, the, impacted, feces, from, the, anus, guinea, pigs, benefit, from, a, diet, of, fresh, grass, hay, such, as, timothy, hay, in, addition, to, food, pellets, which, are, often, based, on, timothy, hay, alfalfa, hay, is, also, a, popular, food, choice, and, most, guinea, pigs, will, eat, large, amounts, of, alfalfa, when, offered, it, though, some, controversy, exists, over, offering, alfalfa, to, adult, guinea, pigs, some, pet, owners, and, veterinary, organizations, have, advised, that, as, a, legume, rather, than, a, grass, hay, alfalfa, consumed, in, large, amounts, may, lead, to, obesity, as, well, as, bladder, stones, from, the, excess, calcium, in, all, animals, except, for, pregnant, and, very, young, guinea, pigs, however, published, scientific, sources, mention, alfalfa, as, a, food, source, that, can, replenish, protein, amino, acids, and, fiber, like, humans, but, unlike, most, other, mammals, guinea, pigs, cannot, synthesize, vitamin, c, and, must, obtain, this, vital, nutrient, from, food, if, guinea, pigs, do, not, ingest, enough, vitamin, c, they, can, suffer, from, potentially, fatal, scurvy, they, require, about, 10, mg, of, vitamin, c, daily, 20, mg, if, pregnant, which, can, be, obtained, through, fresh, raw, fruits, and, vegetables, such, as, broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and, spinach, or, dietary, supplements, or, by, eating, fresh, pellets, designed, for, guinea, pigs, if, they, have, been, handled, properly, healthy, diets, for, guinea, pigs, require, a, complex, balance, of, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and, hydrogen, ions, but, adequate, amounts, of, vitamins, a, d, and, e, are, also, necessary, poor, diets, for, guinea, pigs, have, been, associated, with, muscular, dystrophy, metastatic, calcification, difficulties, with, pregnancy, vitamin, deficiencies, and, teeth, problems, guinea, pigs, tend, to, be, fickle, eaters, when, it, comes, to, fresh, fruits, and, vegetables, after, having, learned, early, in, life, what, is, and, is, not, appropriate, to, consume, their, eating, habits, may, be, difficult, to, change, after, maturity, they, do, not, respond, well, to, sudden, changes, in, their, diet, and, they, may, stop, eating, and, starve, rather, than, accept, new, food, types, a, constant, supply, of, hay, is, generally, recommended, as, guinea, pigs, feed, continuously, and, may, develop, bad, habits, if, food, is, not, present, such, as, chewing, on, their, hair, being, rodents, as, their, teeth, grow, constantly, as, do, their, nails, like, humans, they, routinely, gnaw, on, things, lest, their, teeth, become, too, large, for, their, jaw, a, common, problem, in, rodents, guinea, pigs, chew, on, cloth, paper, plastic, and, rubber, if, available, guinea, pig, owners, may, guinea, pig, proof, their, household, especially, if, they, are, free, to, roam, to, avoid, any, destruction, or, harm, to, the, guinea, pig, itself, some, plants, are, poisonous, to, guinea, pigs, including, bracken, bryony, buttercup, charlock, deadly, nightshade, foxglove, hellebore, hemlock, lily, of, the, valley, mayweed, monkshood, privet, ragwort, rhubarb, speedwell, toadflax, both, linaria, vulgaris, and, linaria, dalmatica, and, wild, celery, additionally, any, plant, which, grows, from, a, bulb, e, g, tulip, or, onion, is, normally, considered, poisonous, as, well, as, ivy, and, oak, tree, leaves, common, ailments, in, domestic, guinea, pigs, include, respiratory, tract, infections, diarrhea, scurvy, vitamin, c, deficiency, typically, characterized, by, sluggishness, abscesses, due, to, infection, often, in, the, neck, due, to, hay, embedded, in, the, throat, or, from, external, scratches, and, infections, by, lice, mites, or, fungus, mange, mites, trixacarus, caviae, are, a, common, cause, of, hair, loss, and, other, symptoms, may, also, include, excessive, scratching, unusually, aggressive, behavior, when, touched, due, to, pain, and, in, some, instances, seizures, guinea, pigs, may, also, suffer, from, running, lice, gliricola, porcelli, a, small, white, insect, that, can, be, seen, moving, through, the, hair, their, eggs, which, appear, as, black, or, white, specks, attached, to, the, hair, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, static, lice, other, causes, of, hair, loss, can, be, hormonal, upsets, caused, by, underlying, medical, conditions, such, as, ovarian, cysts, foreign, bodies, especially, tiny, pieces, of, hay, or, straw, can, become, lodged, in, the, eyes, of, guinea, pigs, resulting, in, excessive, blinking, tearing, and, in, some, cases, an, opaque, film, over, the, eye, due, to, corneal, ulcer, hay, or, straw, dust, can, also, cause, sneezing, while, it, is, normal, for, guinea, pigs, to, sneeze, periodically, frequent, sneezing, may, be, a, symptom, of, pneumonia, especially, in, response, to, atmospheric, changes, pneumonia, may, also, be, accompanied, by, torticollis, and, can, be, fatal, because, the, guinea, pig, has, a, stout, compact, body, it, more, easily, tolerates, excessive, cold, than, excessive, heat, its, normal, body, temperature, is, 38, 40, c, 101, 104, f, so, its, ideal, ambient, air, temperature, range, is, similar, to, a, human, s, about, 18, 24, c, 65, 75, f, consistent, ambient, temperatures, in, excess, of, 32, c, 90, f, have, been, linked, to, hyperthermia, and, death, especially, among, pregnant, sows, guinea, pigs, are, not, well, suited, to, environments, that, feature, wind, or, frequent, drafts, and, respond, poorly, to, extremes, of, humidity, outside, of, the, range, of, 30, 70, guinea, pigs, are, prey, animals, whose, survival, instinct, is, to, mask, pain, and, signs, of, illness, and, many, times, health, problems, may, not, be, apparent, until, a, condition, is, severe, or, in, its, advanced, stages, treatment, of, disease, is, made, more, difficult, by, the, extreme, sensitivity, guinea, pigs, have, to, most, antibiotics, including, penicillin, which, kill, off, the, intestinal, flora, and, quickly, bring, on, episodes, of, diarrhea, and, in, some, cases, death, similar, to, the, inherited, genetic, diseases, of, other, breeds, of, animals, such, as, hip, dysplasia, in, canines, some, genetic, abnormalities, of, guinea, pigs, have, been, reported, most, commonly, the, roan, coloration, of, abyssinian, guinea, pigs, is, associated, with, congenital, eye, disorders, and, problems, with, the, digestive, system, other, genetic, disorders, include, waltzing, disease, deafness, coupled, with, a, tendency, to, run, in, circles, palsy, and, tremor, conditions, if, handled, correctly, early, in, life, guinea, pigs, become, amenable, to, being, picked, up, and, carried, and, seldom, bite, or, scratch, they, are, timid, explorers, who, often, hesitate, to, escape, their, cage, even, when, an, opportunity, presents, itself, still, they, show, considerable, curiosity, when, allowed, to, walk, freely, especially, in, familiar, and, safe, terrain, guinea, pigs, that, become, familiar, with, their, owner, will, whistle, on, the, owner, s, approach, they, will, also, learn, to, whistle, in, response, to, the, rustling, of, plastic, bags, or, the, opening, of, refrigerator, doors, where, their, food, is, most, commonly, stored, domesticated, guinea, pigs, occur, in, many, breeds, that, have, developed, since, their, introduction, to, europe, and, north, america, these, varieties, vary, in, hair, and, color, composition, the, most, common, variety, found, in, pet, stores, is, the, english, shorthair, also, known, as, the, american, which, has, a, short, smooth, coat, and, the, abyssinian, whose, coat, is, ruffled, with, cowlicks, or, rosettes, also, popular, among, breeders, are, the, peruvian, and, the, sheltie, or, silkie, both, straight, longhair, breeds, and, the, texel, a, curly, longhair, grooming, of, guinea, pigs, is, primarily, accomplished, using, combs, or, brushes, shorthair, breeds, are, typically, brushed, weekly, while, longhair, breeds, may, require, daily, grooming, cavy, clubs, and, associations, dedicated, to, the, showing, and, breeding, guinea, pigs, have, been, established, worldwide, the, american, cavy, breeders, association, an, adjunct, to, the, american, rabbit, breeders, association, is, the, governing, body, in, the, united, states, and, canada, the, british, cavy, council, governs, cavy, clubs, in, the, united, kingdom, similar, organizations, exist, in, australia, australian, national, cavy, council, and, new, zealand, new, zealand, cavy, council, each, club, publishes, its, standard, of, perfection, and, determines, which, breeds, are, eligible, for, showing, allergic, symptoms, including, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and, asthma, have, been, documented, in, laboratory, animal, workers, who, come, into, contact, with, guinea, pigs, allergic, reactions, following, direct, exposure, to, guinea, pigs, in, domestic, settings, have, also, been, reported, two, major, guinea, pig, allergens, cav, p, i, and, cav, p, ii, have, been, identified, in, guinea, pig, fluids, urine, and, saliva, and, guinea, pig, dander, people, who, are, allergic, to, guinea, pigs, are, usually, allergic, to, hamsters, and, gerbils, as, well, allergy, shots, can, successfully, treat, an, allergy, to, guinea, pigs, however, treatment, can, take, up, to, 18, months, folklore, traditions, involving, guinea, pigs, are, numerous, they, are, exchanged, as, gifts, used, in, customary, social, and, religious, ceremonies, and, frequently, referred, to, in, spoken, metaphors, they, also, are, used, in, traditional, healing, rituals, by, folk, doctors, or, curanderos, who, use, the, animals, to, diagnose, diseases, such, as, jaundice, rheumatism, arthritis, and, typhus, they, are, rubbed, against, the, bodies, of, the, sick, and, are, seen, as, a, supernatural, medium, black, guinea, pigs, are, considered, especially, useful, for, diagnoses, the, animal, may, be, cut, open, and, its, entrails, examined, to, determine, whether, the, cure, was, effective, these, methods, are, widely, accepted, in, many, parts, of, the, andes, where, western, medicine, is, unavailable, or, distrusted, peruvians, consume, an, estimated, 65, million, guinea, pigs, each, year, the, animal, is, so, entrenched, in, the, culture, that, one, famous, painting, of, the, last, supper, in, the, main, cathedral, in, cusco, shows, christ, the, 12, disciples, dining, on, guinea, pig, the, animal, remains, an, important, aspect, of, certain, religious, events, in, both, rural, and, urban, areas, of, peru, a, religious, celebration, known, as, jaca, tsariy, collecting, the, cuys, is, a, major, festival, in, many, villages, in, the, antonio, raimondi, province, of, eastern, peru, and, is, celebrated, in, smaller, ceremonies, in, lima, it, is, a, syncretistic, event, combining, elements, of, catholicism, and, pre, columbian, religious, practices, and, revolves, around, the, celebration, of, local, patron, saints, the, exact, form, the, jaca, tsariy, takes, differs, from, town, to, town, in, some, localities, a, sirvinti, servant, is, appointed, to, go, from, door, to, door, collecting, donations, of, guinea, pigs, while, in, others, guinea, pigs, may, be, brought, to, a, communal, area, to, be, released, in, a, mock, bullfight, meals, such, as, cuy, chactado, are, always, served, as, part, of, these, festivities, and, the, killing, and, serving, of, the, animal, are, framed, by, some, communities, as, a, symbolic, satire, of, local, politicians, or, important, figures, in, the, tungurahua, and, cotopaxi, provinces, of, central, ecuador, guinea, pigs, are, employed, in, the, celebrations, surrounding, the, feast, of, corpus, christi, as, part, of, the, ensayo, which, is, a, community,

featuring, costumes, and, guinea, pig, dishes, most, guinea, pig, celebrations, occur, on, national, guinea, pig, day, d, a, nacional, del, cuy, across, peru, on, the, second, friday, of, october, as, a, result, of, their, widespread, popularity, especially, in, households, with, children, guinea, pigs, have, shown, a, presence, in, culture, and, media, some, noted, appearances, of, the, animal, in, literature, include, the, short, story, pigs, is, pigs, by, ellis, parker, butler, which, is, a, tale, of, bureaucratic, incompetence, two, guinea, pigs, held, at, a, railway, station, breed,

group, of, highly, intelligent, guinea, pigs, trained, as, operatives, of, the, u, s, government, guinea, pigs, called, cuy, cuye, or, cur, were, originally, domesticated, for, their, meat, in, the, andes, traditionally, the, animal, was, reserved, for, ceremonial, meals, and, as, a, delicacy, by, indigenous, people, in, the, andean, highlands, still, since, the, 1960s, it, has, become, more, socially, acceptable, for, consumption, by, all, people, it, continues, to, be, a, significant, part, of, the, diet, in, peru, and, bolivia, particularly, in, the, andes, mountains, highlands, it, is, also, eaten, in, some, areas, of, ecuador, mainly, in, the, sierra, and, in, colombia, mainly, in, the, southwestern, part, of, the, country, cauca, and, nari, o, departments, because, guinea, pigs, require, much, less, room, than, traditional, livestock, and, reproduce, extremely, quickly, they, are, a, more, profitable, source, of, food, and, income, than, many, traditional, stock, animals, such, as, pigs, and, cattle, moreover, they, can, be, raised, in, an, urban, environment, both, rural, and, urban, families, raise, guinea, pigs, for, supplementary, income, and, the, animals, are, commonly, bought, and, sold, at, local, markets, and, large, scale, municipal, fairs, guinea, pig, meat, is, high, in, protein, and, low, in, fat, and, cholesterol, and, is, described, as, being, similar, to, rabbit, and, the, dark, meat, of, chicken, the, animal, may, be, served, fried, chactado, or, frito, broiled, asado, or, roasted, al, horno, and, in, urban, restaurants, may, also, be,

american, restaurants, in, major, cities, in, the, united, states, serve, cuy, as, a, delicacy, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, la, molina, university, began, exporting, large, breed, guinea, pigs, to, europe, japan, and, the, united, states, in, the, hope, of, increasing, human, consumption, outside, of, countries, in, northern, south, america, efforts, have, been, made, to, promote, guinea, pig, husbandry, in, developing, countries, of, west, africa, where, they, occur, more, widely, than, generally, known, because, they, are, usually, not, covered, by, livestock, statistics, however, it, has, not, been, known, when, and, where, the, animals, have, been, introduced, to, africa, in, cameroon, they, are, widely, distributed, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, they, can, be, found, both, in, peri, urban, environments, as, well, as, in, rural, regions, for, example, in, south, kivu, they, are, also, frequently, held, in, rural, households, in, iringa, region, of, southwestern, tanzania, peruvian, research, universities, especially, la, molina, national, agrarian, university, began, experimental, programs, in, the, 1960s, intending, to, breed, larger, sized, guinea, pigs, subsequent, university, efforts, have, sought, to, change, breeding, and, husbandry, procedures, in, south, america, to, make, the, raising, of, guinea, pigs, as, livestock, more, economically, sustainable, the, variety, of, guinea, pig, produced, by, la, molina, is, fast, growing, and, can, weigh, 3, kg, 6, 6, lb, all, the, large, breeds, of, guinea, pig, are, known, as, cuy, mejorados, and, the, pet, breeds, are, known, as, cuy, criollos, the, three, original, lines, out, of, peru, were, the, per, weighing, 800, g, 28, oz, by, 2, weeks, the, andina, and, the, inti, the, use, of, guinea, pigs, in, scientific, experimentation, dates, back, at, least, to, the, 17th, century, when, the, italian, biologists, marcello, malpighi, and, carlo, fracassati, conducted, vivisections, of, guinea, pigs, in, their, examinations, of, anatomic, structures, in, 1780, antoine, lavoisier, used, a, guinea, pig, in, his, experiments, with, the, calorimeter, a, device, used, to, measure, heat, production, guinea, pigs, played, a, major, role, in, the, establishment, of, germ, theory, in, the, late, 19th, century, through, the, experiments, of, louis, pasteur, mile, roux, and, robert, koch, guinea, pigs, have, been, launched, into, orbital, space, flight, several, times, first, by, the, ussr, on, the, sputnik, 9, biosatellite, of, march, 9, 1961, with, a, successful, recovery, china, also, launched, and, recovered, a, biosatellite, in, 1990, which, included, guinea, pigs, as, passengers, guinea, pigs, remained, popular, laboratory, animals, until, the, later, 20th, century, about, 2, 5, million, guinea, pigs, were, used, annually, in, the, u, s, for, research, in, the, 1960s, but, that, total, decreased, to, about, 375, 000, by, the, mid, 1990s, as, of, 2007, they, constitute, about, 2, of, the, current, total, of, laboratory, animals, in, the, past, they, were, widely, used, to, standardize, vaccines, and, antiviral, agents, they, were, also, often, employed, in, studies, on, the, production, of, antibodies, in, response, to, extreme, allergic, reactions, or, anaphylaxis, less, common, uses, included, research, in, pharmacology, and, irradiation, since, the, middle, 20th, century, they, have, been, replaced, in, laboratory, contexts, primarily, by, mice, and, rats, this, is, in, part, because, research, into, the, genetics, of, guinea, pigs, has, lagged, behind, that, of, other, rodents, although, geneticists, w, e, castle, and, sewall, wright, made, some, contributions, to, this, area, of, study, especially, regarding, coat, color, the, guinea, pig, genome, was, sequenced, in, 2008, as, part, of, the, mammalian, genome, project, but, the, guinea, pig, sequence, scaffolds, have, not, been, assigned, to, chromosomes, the, guinea, pig, was, most, extensively, used, in, research, and, diagnosis, of, infectious, diseases, common, uses, included, identification, of, brucellosis, chagas, disease, cholera, diphtheria, foot, and, mouth, disease, glanders, q, fever, rocky, mountain, spotted, fever, and, various, strains, of, typhus, they, are, still, frequently, used, to, diagnose, tuberculosis, since, they, are, easily, infected, by, human, tuberculosis, bacteria, because, guinea, pigs, are, one, of, the, few, animals, which, like, humans, and, other, primates, cannot, synthesize, vitamin, c, but, must, obtain, it, from, their, diet, they, are, ideal, for, researching, scurvy, from, the, accidental, discovery, in, 1907, that, scurvy, could, be, induced, in, guinea, pigs, to, their, use, to, prove, the, chemical, structure, of, the, scorbutic, factor, in, 1932, the, guinea, pig, model, proved, a, crucial, part, of, vitamin, c, research, complement, an, important, component, for, serology, was, first, isolated, from, the, blood, of, the, guinea, pig, guinea, pigs, have, an, unusual, insulin, mutation, and, are, a, suitable, species, for, the, generation, of, anti, insulin, antibodies, present, at, a, level, 10, times, that, found, in, other, mammals, the, insulin, in, guinea, pigs, may, be, important, in, growth, regulation, a, role, usually, played, by, growth, hormone, additionally, guinea, pigs, have, been, identified, as, model, organisms, for, the, study, of, juvenile, diabetes, and, because, of, the, frequency, of, pregnancy, toxemia, of, pre, eclampsia, in, human, females, their, placental, structure, is, similar, to, that, of, humans, and, their, gestation, period, can, be, divided, into, trimesters, that, resemble, the, stages, of, fetal, development, in, humans, guinea, pig, strains, used, in, scientific, research, are, primarily, outbred, strains, aside, from, the, typical, american, or, english, stock, the, two, main, outbred, strains, in, laboratory, use, are, the, hartley, and, dunkin, hartley, these, english, strains, are, albino, although, pigmented, strains, are, also, available, inbred, strains, are, less, common, and, are, usually, used, for, very, specific, research, such, as, immune, system, molecular, biology, of, the, inbred, strains, that, have, been, created, the, two, still, used, with, any, frequency, are, following, sewall, wright, s, designations, strain, 2, and, strain, 13, hairless, breeds, of, guinea, pigs, have, been, used, in, scientific, research, since, the, 1980s, particularly, for, dermatological, studies, a, hairless, and, immunodeficient, breed, was, the, result, of, a, spontaneous, genetic, mutation, in, inbred, laboratory, strains, from, the, hartley, stock, at, the, eastman, kodak, company, in, 1979, an, immunocompetent, hairless, breed, was, also, identified, by, the, institute, armand, frappier, in, 1978, and, charles, river, laboratories, has, reproduced, this, breed, for, research, since, 1982, cavy, fanciers, then, began, acquiring, hairless, breeds, and, the, pet, hairless, varieties, are, referred, to, as, skinny, pigs, in, english, the, term, guinea, pig, is, commonly, used, as, a, metaphor, for, a, subject, of, scientific, experimentation, or, in, modern, times, a, subject, of, any, experiment, or, test, this, usage, dates, back, to, the, early, 20th, century, the, earliest, examples, cited, by, the, oxford, english, dictionary, date, from, 1913, and, 1920, in, 1933, consumers, research, founders, f, j, schlink, and, arthur, kallet, wrote, a, book, entitled, 100, 000, 000, guinea, pigs, extending, the, metaphor, to, consumer, society, the, book, became, a, national, bestseller, in, the, united, states, thus, further, popularizing, the, term, and, spurred, the, growth, of, the, consumer, protection, movement, during, world, war, ii, the, guinea, pig, club, was, established, at, queen, victoria, hospital, east, grinstead, sussex, england, as, a, social, club, and, mutual, support, network, for, the, patients, of, plastic, surgeon, archibald, mcindoe, who, were, undergoing, previously, untested, reconstruction, procedures, the, negative, connotation, of, the, term, was, later, employed, in, the, novel, the, guinea, pigs, 1970, by, czech, author, ludv, k, vacul, k, as, an, allegory, for, soviet, totalitarianism
