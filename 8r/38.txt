in, taxonomy, binomial, nomenclature, two, term, naming, system, also, called, binary, nomenclature, is, a, formal, system, of, naming, species, of, living, things, by, giving, each, a, name, composed, of, two, parts, both, of, which, use, latin, grammatical, forms, although, they, can, be, based, on, words, from, other, languages, such, a, name, is, called, a, binomial, name, which, may, be, shortened, to, just, binomial, a, binomen, binominal, name, or, a, scientific, name, more, informally, it, is, also, historically, called, a, latin, name, in, the, international, code, of, zoological, nomenclature, iczn, the, system, is, also, called, binominal, nomenclature, with, an, n, before, the, al, in, binominal, which, is, not, a, typographic, error, meaning, two, name, naming, system, the, first, part, of, the, name, the, generic, name, identifies, the, genus, to, which, the, species, belongs, whereas, the, second, part, the, specific, name, or, specific, epithet, distinguishes, the, species, within, the, genus, for, example, modern, humans, belong, to, the, genus, homo, and, within, this, genus, to, the, species, homo, sapiens, tyrannosaurus, rex, is, likely, the, most, widely, known, binomial, the, formal, introduction, of, this, system, of, naming, species, is, credited, to, carl, linnaeus, effectively, beginning, with, his, work, species, plantarum, in, 1753, but, as, early, as, 1622, gaspard, bauhin, introduced, in, his, book, pinax, theatri, botanici, english, illustrated, exposition, of, plants, containing, many, names, of, genera, that, were, later, adopted, by, linnaeus, binomial, nomenclature, was, introduced, in, order, to, provide, succinct, relatively, stable, and, verifiable, names, that, could, be, used, and, understood, internationally, unlike, common, names, which, are, usually, different, in, every, language, the, application, of, binomial, nomenclature, is, now, governed, by, various, internationally, agreed, codes, of, rules, of, which, the, two, most, important, are, the, international, code, of, zoological, nomenclature, iczn, for, animals, and, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, algae, fungi, and, plants, icnafp, or, icn, although, the, general, principles, underlying, binomial, nomenclature, are, common, to, these, two, codes, there, are, some, differences, in, the, terminology, they, use, and, their, particular, rules, in, modern, usage, the, first, letter, of, the, generic, name, is, always, capitalized, in, writing, while, that, of, the, specific, epithet, is, not, even, when, derived, from, a, proper, noun, such, as, the, name, of, a, person, or, place, similarly, both, parts, are, italicized, in, normal, text, or, underlined, in, handwriting, thus, the, binomial, name, of, the, annual, phlox, named, after, botanist, thomas, drummond, is, now, written, as, phlox, drummondii, often, after, a, species, name, is, introduced, in, a, text, the, generic, name, is, abbreviated, to, the, first, letter, in, subsequent, mentions, e, g, p, drummondii, in, scientific, works, the, authority, for, a, binomial, name, is, usually, given, at, least, when, it, is, first, mentioned, and, the, year, of, publication, may, be, specified, the, word, binomial, is, composed, of, two, elements, bi, latin, prefix, meaning, two, and, nomial, the, adjective, form, of, nomen, latin, for, name, in, medieval, latin, the, related, word, binomium, was, used, to, signify, one, term, in, a, binomial, expression, in, mathematics, in, fact, the, latin, word, binomium, may, validly, refer, to, either, of, the, epithets, in, the, binomial, name, which, can, equally, be, referred, to, as, a, binomen, pl, binomina, prior, to, the, adoption, of, the, modern, binomial, system, of, naming, species, a, scientific, name, consisted, of, a, generic, name, combined, with, a, specific, name, that, was, from, one, to, several, words, long, together, they, formed, a, system, of, polynomial, nomenclature, these, names, had, two, separate, functions, first, to, designate, or, label, the, species, and, second, to, be, a, diagnosis, or, description, however, these, two, goals, were, eventually, found, to, be, incompatible, in, a, simple, genus, containing, only, two, species, it, was, easy, to, tell, them, apart, with, a, one, word, genus, and, a, one, word, specific, name, but, as, more, species, were, discovered, the, names, necessarily, became, longer, and, unwieldy, for, instance, plantago, foliis, ovato, lanceolatus, pubescentibus, spica, cylindrica, scapo, tereti, plantain, with, pubescent, ovate, lanceolate, leaves, a, cylindric, spike, and, a, terete, scape, which, we, know, today, as, plantago, media, such, polynomial, names, may, sometimes, look, like, binomials, but, are, significantly, different, for, example, gerard, s, herbal, as, amended, by, johnson, describes, various, kinds, of, spiderwort, the, first, is, called, phalangium, ramosum, branched, spiderwort, the, second, phalangium, non, ramosum, unbranched, spiderwort, the, other, is, aptly, termed, phalangium, ephemerum, virginianum, soon, fading, spiderwort, of, virginia, the, latin, phrases, are, short, descriptions, rather, than, identifying, labels, the, bauhins, in, particular, caspar, bauhin, 1560, 1624, took, some, important, steps, towards, the, binomial, system, by, pruning, the, latin, descriptions, in, many, cases, to, two, words, the, adoption, by, biologists, of, a, system, of, strictly, binomial, nomenclature, is, due, to, swedish, botanist, and, physician, carl, linnaeus, 1707, 1778, it, was, in, linnaeus, s, 1753, species, plantarum, that, he, began, consistently, using, a, one, word, trivial, name, nomen, triviale, after, a, generic, name, genus, name, in, a, system, of, binomial, nomenclature, trivial, names, had, already, appeared, in, his, critica, botanica, 1737, and, philosophia, botanica, 1751, this, trivial, name, is, what, is, now, known, as, a, specific, epithet, icnafp, or, specific, name, iczn, the, bauhins, genus, names, were, retained, in, many, of, these, but, the, descriptive, part, was, reduced, to, a, single, word, linnaeus, s, trivial, names, introduced, the, important, new, idea, that, the, function, of, a, name, could, simply, be, to, give, a, species, a, unique, label, meaning, that, the, name, no, longer, needed, to, be, descriptive, both, parts, could, for, example, be, derived, from, the, names, of, people, thus, gerard, s, phalangium, ephemerum, virginianum, became, tradescantia, virginiana, where, the, genus, name, honoured, john, tradescant, the, younger, an, english, botanist, and, gardener, a, bird, in, the, parrot, family, was, named, psittacus, alexandri, meaning, alexander, s, parrot, after, alexander, the, great, whose, armies, introduced, eastern, parakeets, to, greece, linnaeus, s, trivial, names, were, much, easier, to, remember, and, use, than, the, parallel, polynomial, names, and, eventually, replaced, them, the, value, of, the, binomial, nomenclature, system, derives, primarily, from, its, economy, its, widespread, use, and, the, uniqueness, and, stability, of, names, that, the, codes, of, zoological, and, botanical, bacterial, and, viral, nomenclature, provide, binomial, nomenclature, for, species, has, the, effect, that, when, a, species, is, moved, from, one, genus, to, another, sometimes, the, specific, name, or, epithet, must, be, changed, as, well, this, may, happen, because, the, specific, name, is, already, used, in, the, new, genus, or, to, agree, in, gender, with, the, new, genus, if, the, specific, epithet, is, an, adjective, modifying, the, genus, name, some, biologists, have, argued, for, the, combination, of, the, genus, name, and, specific, epithet, into, a, single, unambiguous, name, or, for, the, use, of, uninomials, as, used, in, nomenclature, of, ranks, above, species, because, genus, names, are, unique, only, within, a, nomenclature, code, it, is, possible, for, homonyms, two, or, more, species, sharing, the, same, genus, name, to, happen, and, even, the, same, binomial, if, they, occur, in, different, kingdoms, at, least, 1, 258, instances, of, genus, name, duplication, occur, mainly, between, zoology, and, botany, nomenclature, including, binomial, nomenclature, is, not, the, same, as, classification, although, the, two, are, related, classification, is, the, ordering, of, items, into, groups, based, on, similarities, or, differences, in, biological, classification, species, are, one, of, the, kinds, of, item, to, be, classified, in, principle, the, names, given, to, species, could, be, completely, independent, of, their, classification, this, is, not, the, case, for, binomial, names, since, the, first, part, of, a, binomial, is, the, name, of, the, genus, into, which, the, species, is, placed, above, the, rank, of, genus, binomial, nomenclature, and, classification, are, partly, independent, for, example, a, species, retains, its, binomial, name, if, it, is, moved, from, one, family, to, another, or, from, one, order, to, another, unless, it, better, fits, a, different, genus, in, the, same, or, different, family, or, it, is, split, from, its, old, genus, and, placed, in, a, newly, created, genus, the, independence, is, only, partial, since, the, names, of, families, and, other, higher, taxa, are, usually, based, on, genera, taxonomy, includes, both, nomenclature, and, classification, its, first, stages, sometimes, called, alpha, taxonomy, are, concerned, with, finding, describing, and, naming, species, of, living, or, fossil, organisms, binomial, nomenclature, is, thus, an, important, part, of, taxonomy, as, it, is, the, system, by, which, species, are, named, taxonomists, are, also, concerned, with, classification, including, its, principles, procedures, and, rules, a, complete, binomial, name, is, always, treated, grammatically, as, if, it, were, a, phrase, in, the, latin, language, hence, the, common, use, of, the, term, latin, name, for, a, binomial, name, however, the, two, parts, of, a, binomial, name, can, each, be, derived, from, a, number, of, sources, of, which, latin, is, only, one, these, include, the, first, part, of, the, name, which, identifies, the, genus, must, be, a, word, which, can, be, treated, as, a, latin, singular, noun, in, the, nominative, case, it, must, be, unique, within, the, purview, of, each, nomenclatural, code, but, can, be, repeated, between, them, thus, huia, recurvata, is, an, extinct, species, of, plant, found, as, fossils, in, yunnan, china, whereas, huia, masonii, is, a, species, of, frog, found, in, java, indonesia, the, second, part, of, the, name, which, identifies, the, species, within, the, genus, is, also, treated, grammatically, as, a, latin, word, it, can, have, one, of, a, number, of, forms, whereas, the, first, part, of, a, binomial, name, must, be, unique, within, the, purview, of, each, nomenclatural, code, the, second, part, is, quite, commonly, used, in, two, or, more, genera, as, is, shown, by, examples, of, hodgsonii, above, but, cannot, be, used, more, than, once, within, a, single, genus, the, full, binomial, name, must, be, unique, within, each, code, from, the, early, 19th, century, onwards, it, became, ever, more, apparent, that, a, body, of, rules, was, necessary, to, govern, scientific, names, in, the, course, of, time, these, became, nomenclature, codes, the, international, code, of, zoological, nomenclature, iczn, governs, the, naming, of, animals, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, algae, fungi, and, plants, icnafp, that, of, plants, including, cyanobacteria, and, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, of, bacteria, icnb, that, of, bacteria, including, archaea, virus, names, are, governed, by, the, international, committee, on, taxonomy, of, viruses, ictv, a, taxonomic, code, which, determines, taxa, as, well, as, names, these, codes, differ, in, certain, ways, e, g, unifying, the, different, codes, into, a, single, code, the, biocode, has, been, suggested, although, implementation, is, not, in, sight, there, is, also, a, published, code, for, a, different, system, of, biotic, nomenclature, which, does, not, use, ranks, above, species, but, instead, names, clades, this, is, called, phylocode, as, noted, above, there, are, some, differences, between, the, codes, in, how, binomials, can, be, formed, for, example, the, iczn, allows, both, parts, to, be, the, same, while, the, icnafp, does, not, another, difference, is, in, how, personal, names, are, used, in, forming, specific, names, or, epithets, the, icnafp, sets, out, precise, rules, by, which, a, personal, name, is, to, be, converted, to, a, specific, epithet, in, particular, names, ending, in, a, consonant, but, not, er, are, treated, as, first, being, converted, into, latin, by, adding, ius, for, a, man, or, ia, for, a, woman, and, then, being, made, genitive, i, e, meaning, of, that, person, or, persons, this, produces, specific, epithets, like, lecardii, for, lecard, male, wilsoniae, for, wilson, female, and, brauniarum, for, the, braun, sisters, by, contrast, the, iczn, does, not, require, the, intermediate, creation, of, a, latin, form, of, a, personal, name, allowing, the, genitive, ending, to, be, added, directly, to, the, personal, name, this, explains, the, difference, between, the, names, of, the, plant, magnolia, hodgsonii, and, the, bird, anthus, hodgsoni, furthermore, the, icnafp, requires, names, not, published, in, the, form, required, by, the, code, to, be, corrected, to, conform, to, it, whereas, the, iczn, is, more, protective, of, the, form, used, by, the, original, author, by, tradition, the, binomial, names, of, species, are, usually, typeset, in, italics, for, example, homo, sapiens, generally, the, binomial, should, be, printed, in, a, font, style, different, from, that, used, in, the, normal, text, for, example, several, more, homo, sapiens, fossils, were, discovered, when, handwritten, a, binomial, name, should, be, underlined, for, example, homo, sapiens, the, first, part, of, the, binomial, the, genus, name, is, always, written, with, an, initial, capital, letter, older, sources, particularly, botanical, works, published, before, the, 1950s, used, a, different, convention, if, the, second, part, of, the, name, was, derived, from, a, proper, noun, e, g, the, name, of, a, person, or, place, a, capital, letter, was, used, thus, the, modern, form, berberis, darwinii, was, written, as, berberis, darwinii, a, capital, was, also, used, when, the, name, is, formed, by, two, nouns, in, apposition, e, g, panthera, leo, or, centaurea, cyanus, in, current, usage, the, second, part, is, never, written, with, an, initial, capital, when, used, with, a, common, name, the, scientific, name, often, follows, in, parentheses, although, this, varies, with, publication, for, example, the, house, sparrow, passer, domesticus, is, decreasing, in, europe, the, binomial, name, should, generally, be, written, in, full, the, exception, to, this, is, when, several, species, from, the, same, genus, are, being, listed, or, discussed, in, the, same, paper, or, report, or, the, same, species, is, mentioned, repeatedly, in, which, case, the, genus, is, written, in, full, when, it, is, first, used, but, may, then, be, abbreviated, to, an, initial, and, a, period, full, stop, for, example, a, list, of, members, of, the, genus, canis, might, be, written, as, canis, lupus, c, aureus, c, simensis, in, rare, cases, this, abbreviated, form, has, spread, to, more, general, use, for, example, the, bacterium, escherichia, coli, is, often, referred, to, as, just, e, coli, and, tyrannosaurus, rex, is, perhaps, even, better, known, simply, as, t, rex, these, two, both, often, appearing, in, this, form, in, popular, writing, even, where, the, full, genus, name, has, not, already, been, given, the, abbreviation, sp, is, used, when, the, actual, specific, name, cannot, or, need, not, be, specified, the, abbreviation, spp, plural, indicates, several, species, these, abbreviations, are, not, italicised, or, underlined, for, example, canis, sp, means, an, unspecified, species, of, the, genus, canis, while, canis, spp, means, two, or, more, species, of, the, genus, canis, these, abbreviations, should, not, be, confused, with, the, abbreviations, ssp, zoology, or, subsp, botany, plurals, sspp, or, subspp, referring, to, one, or, more, subspecies, see, trinomen, zoology, and, infraspecific, name, the, abbreviation, cf, i, e, confer, in, latin, is, used, to, compare, individuals, taxa, with, known, described, species, conventions, for, use, of, the, cf, qualifier, vary, in, paleontology, it, is, typically, used, when, the, identification, is, not, confirmed, for, example, corvus, cf, nasicus, was, used, to, indicate, a, fossil, bird, similar, to, the, cuban, crow, but, not, certainly, identified, as, this, species, in, molecular, systematics, papers, cf, may, be, used, to, indicate, one, or, more, undescribed, species, assumed, to, be, related, to, a, described, species, for, example, in, a, paper, describing, the, phylogeny, of, small, benthic, freshwater, fish, called, darters, five, undescribed, putative, species, ozark, sheltowee, wildcat, ihiyo, and, mamequit, darters, notable, for, brightly, colored, nuptial, males, with, distinctive, color, patterns, were, referred, to, as, etheostoma, cf, spectabile, because, they, had, been, viewed, as, related, to, but, distinct, from, etheostoma, spectabile, orangethroat, darter, this, view, was, supported, to, varying, degrees, by, dna, analysis, the, somewhat, informal, use, of, taxa, names, with, qualifying, abbreviations, is, referred, to, as, open, nomenclature, and, it, is, not, subject, to, strict, usage, codes, in, some, contexts, the, dagger, symbol, may, be, used, before, or, after, the, binomial, name, to, indicate, that, the, species, is, extinct, in, scholarly, texts, at, least, the, first, or, main, use, of, the, binomial, name, is, usually, followed, by, the, authority, a, way, of, designating, the, scientist, s, who, first, published, the, name, the, authority, is, written, in, slightly, different, ways, in, zoology, and, botany, for, names, governed, by, the, iczn, the, surname, is, usually, written, in, full, together, with, the, date, normally, only, the, year, of, publication, one, example, of, author, citation, of, scientific, name, is, amabela, m, schler, 1880, the, iczn, recommends, that, the, original, author, and, date, of, a, name, should, be, cited, at, least, once, in, each, work, dealing, with, the, taxon, denoted, by, that, name, for, names, governed, by, the, icnafp, the, name, is, generally, reduced, to, a, standard, abbreviation, and, the, date, omitted, the, international, plant, names, index, maintains, an, approved, list, of, botanical, author, abbreviations, historically, abbreviations, were, used, in, zoology, too, when, the, original, name, is, changed, e, g, the, species, is, moved, to, a, different, genus, both, codes, use, parentheses, around, the, original, authority, the, icnafp, also, requires, the, person, who, made, the, change, to, be, given, in, the, icnafp, the, original, name, is, then, called, the, basionym, some, examples, binomial, nomenclature, as, described, here, is, a, system, for, naming, species, implicitly, it, includes, a, system, for, naming, genera, since, the, first, part, of, the, name, of, the, species, is, a, genus, name, in, a, classification, system, based, on, ranks, there, are, also, ways, of, naming, ranks, above, the, level, of, genus, and, below, the, level, of, species, ranks, above, genus, e, g, family, order, class, receive, one, part, names, which, are, conventionally, not, written, in, italics, thus, the, house, sparrow, passer, domesticus, belongs, to, the, family, passeridae, family, names, are, normally, based, on, genus, names, although, the, endings, used, differ, between, zoology, and, botany, ranks, below, species, receive, three, part, names, conventionally, written, in, italics, like, the, names, of, species, there, are, significant, differences, between, the, iczn, and, the, icnafp, in, zoology, the, only, formal, rank, below, species, is, subspecies, and, the, name, is, written, simply, as, three, parts, a, trinomen, thus, one, of, the, subspecies, of, the, olive, backed, pipit, is, anthus, hodgsoni, berezowskii, informally, in, some, circumstances, a, form, may, be, appended, for, example, harmonia, axyridis, f, spectabilis, is, the, harlequin, ladybird, in, its, black, or, melanic, forms, having, four, large, orange, or, red, spots, in, botany, there, are, many, ranks, below, species, and, although, the, name, itself, is, written, in, three, parts, a, connecting, term, not, part, of, the, name, is, needed, to, show, the, rank, thus, the, american, black, elder, is, sambucus, nigra, subsp, canadensis, the, white, flowered, form, of, the, ivy, leaved, cyclamen, is, cyclamen, hederifolium, f, albiflorum
