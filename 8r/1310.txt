public, health, is, the, science, and, art, of, preventing, disease, prolonging, life, and, promoting, health, through, the, organized, efforts, and, informed, choices, of, society, organizations, public, and, private, communities, and, individuals, analyzing, the, determinants, of, health, of, a, population, and, the, threats, it, faces, is, the, basis, for, public, health, the, public, can, be, as, small, as, a, handful, of, people, or, as, large, as, a, village, or, an, entire, city, in, the, case, of, a, pandemic, it, may, encompass, several, continents, the, concept, of, health, takes, into, account, physical, psychological, and, social, well, being, among, other, factors, public, health, is, an, interdisciplinary, field, for, example, epidemiology, biostatistics, social, sciences, and, management, of, health, services, are, all, relevant, other, important, sub, fields, include, environmental, health, community, health, behavioral, health, health, economics, public, policy, mental, health, health, education, health, politics, occupational, safety, disability, oral, health, gender, issues, in, health, and, sexual, and, reproductive, health, public, health, together, with, primary, care, secondary, care, and, tertiary, care, is, part, of, a, country, s, overall, healthcare, system, public, health, is, implemented, through, the, surveillance, of, cases, and, health, indicators, and, through, the, promotion, of, healthy, behaviors, common, public, health, initiatives, include, promotion, of, hand, washing, and, breastfeeding, delivery, of, vaccinations, promoting, ventilation, and, improved, air, quality, both, indoors, and, outdoors, suicide, prevention, smoking, cessation, obesity, education, increasing, healthcare, accessibility, and, distribution, of, condoms, to, control, the, spread, of, sexually, transmitted, diseases, there, is, a, significant, disparity, in, access, to, health, care, and, public, health, initiatives, between, developed, countries, and, developing, countries, as, well, as, within, developing, countries, in, developing, countries, public, health, infrastructures, are, still, forming, there, may, not, be, enough, trained, healthcare, workers, monetary, resources, or, in, some, cases, sufficient, knowledge, to, provide, even, a, basic, level, of, medical, care, and, disease, prevention, a, major, public, health, concern, in, developing, countries, is, poor, maternal, and, child, health, exacerbated, by, malnutrition, and, poverty, coupled, with, governments, reluctance, in, implementing, public, health, policies, developed, nations, are, at, greater, risk, of, certain, public, health, crises, including, childhood, obesity, although, overweight, populations, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, are, catching, up, from, the, beginnings, of, human, civilization, communities, promoted, health, and, fought, disease, at, the, population, level, in, complex, pre, industrialized, societies, interventions, designed, to, reduce, health, risks, could, be, the, initiative, of, different, stakeholders, such, as, army, generals, the, clergy, or, rulers, great, britain, became, a, leader, in, the, development, of, public, health, initiatives, beginning, in, the, 19th, century, due, to, the, fact, that, it, was, the, first, modern, urban, nation, worldwide, the, public, health, initiatives, that, began, to, emerge, initially, focused, on, sanitation, for, example, the, liverpool, and, london, sewerage, systems, control, of, infectious, diseases, including, vaccination, and, quarantine, and, an, evolving, infrastructure, of, various, sciences, e, g, statistics, microbiology, epidemiology, sciences, of, engineering, public, health, has, been, defined, as, the, science, and, art, of, preventing, disease, prolonging, life, and, improving, quality, of, life, through, organized, efforts, and, informed, choices, of, society, organizations, public, and, private, communities, and, individuals, the, public, can, be, as, small, as, a, handful, of, people, or, as, large, as, a, village, or, an, entire, city, the, concept, of, health, takes, into, account, physical, psychological, and, social, well, being, as, such, according, to, the, world, health, organization, health, is, a, state, of, complete, physical, mental, and, social, well, being, and, not, merely, the, absence, of, disease, or, infirmity, public, health, is, related, to, global, health, which, is, the, health, of, populations, in, the, worldwide, context, it, has, been, defined, as, the, area, of, study, research, and, practice, that, places, a, priority, on, improving, health, and, achieving, equity, in, health, for, all, people, worldwide, international, health, is, a, field, of, health, care, usually, with, a, public, health, emphasis, dealing, with, health, across, regional, or, national, boundaries, public, health, is, not, the, same, as, public, healthcare, publicly, funded, health, care, the, term, preventive, medicine, is, related, to, public, health, the, american, board, of, preventive, medicine, separates, three, categories, of, preventive, medicine, aerospace, health, occupational, health, and, public, health, and, general, preventative, medicine, jung, boris, and, lushniak, argue, that, preventive, medicine, should, be, considered, the, medical, specialty, for, public, health, but, note, that, the, american, college, of, preventive, medicine, and, american, board, of, preventive, medicine, do, not, prominently, use, the, term, public, health, 1, preventive, medicine, specialists, are, trained, as, clinicians, and, address, complex, health, needs, of, a, population, such, as, by, assessing, the, need, for, disease, prevention, programs, using, the, best, methods, to, implement, them, and, assessing, their, effectiveness, 1, 3, since, the, 1990s, many, scholars, in, public, health, have, been, using, the, term, population, health, 3, there, are, no, medical, specialties, directly, related, to, population, health, 4, valles, argues, that, consideration, of, health, equity, is, a, fundamental, part, of, population, health, scholars, such, as, coggon, and, pielke, express, concerns, about, bringing, general, issues, of, wealth, distribution, into, population, health, pielke, worries, about, stealth, issue, advocacy, in, population, health, 163, jung, boris, and, lushniak, consider, population, health, to, be, a, concept, that, is, the, goal, of, an, activity, called, public, health, practiced, through, the, specialty, preventive, medicine, 4, lifestyle, medicine, uses, individual, lifestyle, modification, to, prevent, or, revert, disease, and, can, be, considered, a, component, of, preventive, medicine, and, public, health, it, is, implemented, as, part, of, primary, care, rather, than, a, specialty, in, its, own, right, 3, valles, argues, that, the, term, social, medicine, has, a, narrower, and, more, biomedical, focus, than, the, term, population, health, 7, the, purpose, of, a, public, health, intervention, is, to, prevent, and, mitigate, diseases, injuries, and, other, health, conditions, the, overall, goal, is, to, improve, the, health, of, individuals, and, populations, and, to, increase, life, expectancy, public, health, is, a, complex, term, composed, of, many, elements, and, different, practices, it, is, a, multi, faceted, interdisciplinary, field, for, example, epidemiology, biostatistics, social, sciences, and, management, of, health, services, are, all, relevant, other, important, sub, fields, include, environmental, health, community, health, behavioral, health, health, economics, public, policy, mental, health, health, education, health, politics, occupational, safety, disability, gender, issues, in, health, and, sexual, and, reproductive, health, modern, public, health, practice, requires, multidisciplinary, teams, of, public, health, workers, and, professionals, teams, might, include, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, physician, assistants, public, health, nurses, midwives, medical, microbiologists, pharmacists, economists, sociologists, geneticists, data, managers, environmental, health, officers, public, health, inspectors, bioethicists, gender, experts, sexual, and, reproductive, health, specialists, physicians, and, veterinarians, the, elements, and, priorities, of, public, health, have, evolved, over, time, and, are, continuing, to, evolve, common, public, health, initiatives, include, promotion, of, hand, washing, and, breastfeeding, delivery, of, vaccinations, suicide, prevention, smoking, cessation, obesity, education, increasing, healthcare, accessibility, and, distribution, of, condoms, to, control, the, spread, of, sexually, transmitted, diseases, public, health, aims, are, achieved, through, surveillance, of, cases, and, the, promotion, of, healthy, behaviors, communities, and, environments, analyzing, the, determinants, of, health, of, a, population, and, the, threats, it, faces, is, the, basis, for, public, health, many, diseases, are, preventable, through, simple, nonmedical, methods, for, example, research, has, shown, that, the, simple, act, of, handwashing, with, soap, can, prevent, the, spread, of, many, contagious, diseases, in, other, cases, treating, a, disease, or, controlling, a, pathogen, can, be, vital, to, preventing, its, spread, to, others, either, during, an, outbreak, of, infectious, disease, or, through, contamination, of, food, or, water, supplies, public, health, together, with, primary, care, secondary, care, and, tertiary, care, is, part, of, a, country, s, overall, health, care, system, many, interventions, of, public, health, interest, are, delivered, outside, of, health, facilities, such, as, food, safety, surveillance, distribution, of, condoms, and, needle, exchange, programs, for, the, prevention, of, transmissible, diseases, public, health, requires, geographic, information, systems, gis, because, risk, vulnerability, and, exposure, involve, geographic, aspects, a, dilemma, in, public, health, ethics, is, dealing, with, the, conflict, between, individual, rights, and, maximizing, right, to, health, 28, public, health, is, justified, by, consequentialist, utilitarian, ideas, 153, but, is, constrained, and, critiqued, by, liberal, deontological, principlist, and, libertarian, philosophies, 99, 95, 74, 123, stephen, holland, argues, that, it, can, be, easy, to, find, a, particular, framework, to, justify, any, viewpoint, on, public, health, issues, but, that, the, correct, approach, is, to, find, a, framework, that, best, describes, a, situation, and, see, what, it, implies, about, public, health, policy, 154, the, definition, of, health, is, vague, and, there, are, many, conceptualizations, public, health, practitioners, definition, of, health, can, different, markedly, from, members, of, the, public, or, clinicians, this, can, mean, that, members, of, the, public, view, the, values, behind, public, health, interventions, as, alien, which, can, cause, resentment, amongst, the, public, towards, certain, interventions, 230, such, vagueness, can, be, a, problem, for, health, promotion, 241, critics, have, argued, that, public, health, tends, to, place, more, focus, on, individual, factors, associated, with, health, at, the, expense, of, factors, operating, at, the, population, level, 9, historically, public, health, campaigns, have, been, criticized, as, a, form, of, healthism, as, moralistic, in, nature, rather, than, being, focused, on, health, medical, doctors, petr, shkrabanek, and, james, mccormick, wrote, a, series, of, publications, on, this, topic, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, criticizing, the, uk, s, the, health, of, the, nation, campaign, these, publications, exposed, abuse, of, epidemiology, and, statistics, by, the, public, health, movement, to, support, lifestyle, interventions, and, screening, programs, 85, a, combination, of, inculcating, a, fear, of, ill, health, and, a, strong, notion, of, individual, responsibility, has, been, criticized, as, a, form, of, health, fascism, by, a, number, of, scholars, objectifying, the, individual, with, no, considerations, of, emotional, or, social, factors, 8, 7, 81, when, public, health, initiatives, began, to, emerge, in, england, in, modern, times, 18th, century, onwards, there, were, three, core, strands, of, public, health, which, were, all, related, to, statecraft, supply, of, clean, water, and, sanitation, for, example, london, sewerage, system, control, of, infectious, diseases, including, vaccination, and, quarantine, an, evolving, infrastructure, of, various, sciences, e, g, statistics, microbiology, epidemiology, sciences, of, engineering, great, britain, was, a, leader, in, the, development, of, public, health, during, that, time, period, out, of, necessity, great, britain, was, the, first, modern, urban, nation, by, 1851, more, than, half, of, the, population, lived, in, settlements, of, more, than, 2000, people, this, led, to, a, certain, type, of, distress, which, then, led, to, public, health, initiatives, later, that, particular, concern, faded, away, with, the, onset, of, the, epidemiological, transition, and, as, the, prevalence, of, infectious, diseases, decreased, through, the, 20th, century, public, health, began, to, put, more, focus, on, chronic, diseases, such, as, cancer, and, heart, disease, previous, efforts, in, many, developed, countries, had, already, led, to, dramatic, reductions, in, the, infant, mortality, rate, using, preventive, methods, in, britain, the, infant, mortality, rate, fell, from, over, 15, in, 1870, to, 7, by, 1930, a, major, public, health, concern, in, developing, countries, is, poor, maternal, and, child, health, exacerbated, by, malnutrition, and, poverty, the, who, reports, that, a, lack, of, exclusive, breastfeeding, during, the, first, six, months, of, life, contributes, to, over, a, million, avoidable, child, deaths, each, year, public, health, surveillance, has, led, to, the, identification, and, prioritization, of, many, public, health, issues, facing, the, world, today, including, hiv, aids, diabetes, waterborne, diseases, zoonotic, diseases, and, antibiotic, resistance, leading, to, the, reemergence, of, infectious, diseases, such, as, tuberculosis, antibiotic, resistance, also, known, as, drug, resistance, was, the, theme, of, world, health, day, 2011, for, example, the, who, reports, that, at, least, 220, million, people, worldwide, have, diabetes, its, incidence, is, increasing, rapidly, and, it, is, projected, that, the, number, of, diabetes, deaths, will, double, by, 2030, in, a, june, 2010, editorial, in, the, medical, journal, the, lancet, the, authors, opined, that, the, fact, that, type, 2, diabetes, a, largely, preventable, disorder, has, reached, epidemic, proportion, is, a, public, health, humiliation, the, risk, of, type, 2, diabetes, is, closely, linked, with, the, growing, problem, of, obesity, the, who, s, latest, estimates, as, of, june, 2016, highlighted, that, globally, approximately, 1, 9, billion, adults, were, overweight, in, 2014, and, 41, million, children, under, the, age, of, five, were, overweight, in, 2014, once, considered, a, problem, in, high, income, countries, it, is, now, on, the, rise, in, low, income, countries, especially, in, urban, settings, many, public, health, programs, are, increasingly, dedicating, attention, and, resources, to, the, issue, of, obesity, with, objectives, to, address, the, underlying, causes, including, healthy, diet, and, physical, exercise, the, national, institute, for, health, and, care, research, nihr, has, published, a, review, of, research, on, what, local, authorities, can, do, to, tackle, obesity, the, review, covers, interventions, in, the, food, environment, what, people, buy, and, eat, the, built, and, natural, environments, schools, and, the, community, as, well, as, those, focussing, on, active, travel, leisure, services, and, public, sports, weight, management, programmes, and, system, wide, approaches, health, inequalities, driven, by, the, social, determinants, of, health, are, also, a, growing, area, of, concern, in, public, health, a, central, challenge, to, securing, health, equity, is, that, the, same, social, structures, that, contribute, to, health, inequities, also, operate, and, are, reproduced, by, public, health, organizations, in, other, words, public, health, organizations, have, evolved, to, better, meet, the, needs, of, some, groups, more, than, others, the, result, is, often, that, those, most, in, need, of, preventative, interventions, are, least, likely, to, receive, them, and, interventions, can, actually, aggravate, inequities, as, they, are, often, inadvertently, tailored, to, the, needs, of, the, normative, group, identifying, bias, within, public, health, research, and, practice, is, essential, to, ensuring, public, health, efforts, mitigate, and, don, t, aggravate, health, inequities, the, world, health, organization, who, is, a, specialized, agency, of, the, united, nations, responsible, for, international, public, health, the, who, constitution, which, establishes, the, agency, s, governing, structure, and, principles, states, its, main, objective, as, the, attainment, by, all, peoples, of, the, highest, possible, level, of, health, the, who, s, broad, mandate, includes, advocating, for, universal, healthcare, monitoring, public, health, risks, coordinating, responses, to, health, emergencies, and, promoting, human, health, and, well, being, the, who, has, played, a, leading, role, in, several, public, health, achievements, most, notably, the, eradication, of, smallpox, the, near, eradication, of, polio, and, the, development, of, an, ebola, vaccine, its, current, priorities, include, communicable, diseases, particularly, hiv, aids, ebola, covid, 19, malaria, and, tuberculosis, non, communicable, diseases, such, as, heart, disease, and, cancer, healthy, diet, nutrition, and, food, security, occupational, health, and, substance, abuse, most, countries, have, their, own, governmental, public, health, agency, often, called, the, ministry, of, health, with, responsibility, for, domestic, health, issues, for, example, in, the, united, states, state, and, local, health, departments, are, on, the, front, line, of, public, health, initiatives, in, addition, to, their, national, duties, the, united, states, public, health, service, phs, led, by, the, surgeon, general, of, the, united, states, public, health, service, and, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, headquartered, in, atlanta, are, also, involved, with, international, health, activities, most, governments, recognize, the, importance, of, public, health, programs, in, reducing, the, incidence, of, disease, disability, and, the, effects, of, aging, and, other, physical, and, mental, health, conditions, however, public, health, generally, receives, significantly, less, government, funding, compared, with, medicine, although, the, collaboration, of, local, health, and, government, agencies, is, considered, best, practice, to, improve, public, health, the, pieces, of, evidence, available, to, support, this, is, limited, public, health, programs, providing, vaccinations, have, made, major, progress, in, promoting, health, including, substantially, reducing, the, occurrence, of, cholera, and, polio, and, eradicating, smallpox, diseases, that, have, plagued, humanity, for, thousands, of, years, the, world, health, organization, who, identifies, core, functions, of, public, health, programs, including, in, particular, public, health, surveillance, programs, can, many, health, problems, are, due, to, maladaptive, personal, behaviors, from, an, evolutionary, psychology, perspective, over, consumption, of, novel, substances, that, are, harmful, is, due, to, the, activation, of, an, evolved, reward, system, for, substances, such, as, drugs, tobacco, alcohol, refined, salt, fat, and, carbohydrates, new, technologies, such, as, modern, transportation, also, cause, reduced, physical, activity, research, has, found, that, behavior, is, more, effectively, changed, by, taking, evolutionary, motivations, into, consideration, instead, of, only, presenting, information, about, health, effects, the, marketing, industry, has, long, known, the, importance, of, associating, products, with, high, status, and, attractiveness, to, others, films, are, increasingly, being, recognized, as, a, public, health, tool, with, the, harvard, university, s, t, h, chan, school, of, public, health, categorizing, such, films, as, impact, filmmaking, in, fact, film, festivals, and, competitions, have, been, established, to, specifically, promote, films, about, health, conversely, it, has, been, argued, that, emphasizing, the, harmful, and, undesirable, effects, of, tobacco, smoking, on, other, persons, and, imposing, smoking, bans, in, public, places, have, been, particularly, effective, in, reducing, tobacco, smoking, public, libraries, can, also, be, beneficial, tools, for, public, health, changes, they, provide, access, to, healthcare, information, link, people, to, healthcare, services, and, even, can, provide, direct, care, in, certain, situations, as, well, as, seeking, to, improve, population, health, through, the, implementation, of, specific, population, level, interventions, public, health, contributes, to, medical, care, by, identifying, and, assessing, population, needs, for, health, care, services, including, some, programs, and, policies, associated, with, public, health, promotion, and, prevention, can, be, controversial, one, such, example, is, programs, focusing, on, the, prevention, of, hiv, transmission, through, safe, sex, campaigns, and, needle, exchange, programs, another, is, the, control, of, tobacco, smoking, many, nations, have, implemented, major, initiatives, to, cut, smoking, such, as, increased, taxation, and, bans, on, smoking, in, some, or, all, public, places, supporters, argue, by, presenting, evidence, that, smoking, is, one, of, the, major, killers, and, that, therefore, governments, have, a, duty, to, reduce, the, death, rate, both, through, limiting, passive, second, hand, smoking, and, by, providing, fewer, opportunities, for, people, to, smoke, opponents, say, that, this, undermines, individual, freedom, and, personal, responsibility, and, worry, that, the, state, may, be, encouraged, to, remove, more, and, more, choice, in, the, name, of, better, population, health, overall, psychological, research, confirms, this, tension, between, concerns, about, public, health, and, concerns, about, personal, liberty, i, the, best, predictor, of, complying, with, public, health, recommendations, such, as, hand, washing, mask, wearing, and, staying, at, home, except, for, essential, activity, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, was, people, s, perceived, duties, to, prevent, harm, but, ii, the, best, predictor, of, flouting, such, public, health, recommendations, was, valuing, liberty, more, than, equality, simultaneously, while, communicable, diseases, have, historically, ranged, uppermost, as, a, global, health, priority, non, communicable, diseases, and, the, underlying, behavior, related, risk, factors, have, been, at, the, bottom, this, is, changing, however, as, illustrated, by, the, united, nations, hosting, its, first, general, assembly, special, summit, on, the, issue, of, non, communicable, diseases, in, september, 2011, there, is, a, significant, disparity, in, access, to, health, care, and, public, health, initiatives, between, developed, countries, and, developing, countries, as, well, as, within, developing, countries, in, developing, countries, public, health, infrastructures, are, still, forming, there, may, not, be, enough, trained, health, workers, monetary, resources, or, in, some, cases, sufficient, knowledge, to, provide, even, a, basic, level, of, medical, care, and, disease, prevention, as, a, result, a, large, majority, of, disease, and, mortality, in, developing, countries, results, from, and, contributes, to, extreme, poverty, for, example, many, african, governments, spend, less, than, 100, usd, per, person, per, year, on, health, care, while, in, the, united, states, the, federal, government, spent, approximately, 10, 600, usd, per, capita, in, 2019, however, expenditures, on, health, care, should, not, be, confused, with, spending, on, public, health, public, health, measures, may, not, generally, be, considered, health, care, in, the, strictest, sense, for, example, mandating, the, use, of, seat, belts, in, cars, can, save, countless, lives, and, contribute, to, the, health, of, a, population, but, typically, money, spent, enforcing, this, rule, would, not, count, as, money, spent, on, health, care, large, parts, of, the, world, remained, plagued, by, largely, preventable, or, treatable, infectious, diseases, in, addition, to, this, however, many, developing, countries, are, also, experiencing, an, epidemiological, shift, and, polarization, in, which, populations, are, now, experiencing, more, of, the, effects, of, chronic, diseases, as, life, expectancy, increases, the, poorer, communities, being, heavily, affected, by, both, chronic, and, infectious, diseases, another, major, public, health, concern, in, the, developing, world, is, poor, maternal, and, child, health, exacerbated, by, malnutrition, and, poverty, the, who, reports, that, a, lack, of, exclusive, breastfeeding, during, the, first, six, months, of, life, contributes, to, over, a, million, avoidable, child, deaths, each, year, intermittent, preventive, therapy, aimed, at, treating, and, preventing, malaria, episodes, among, pregnant, women, and, young, children, is, one, public, health, measure, in, endemic, countries, since, the, 1980s, the, growing, field, of, population, health, has, broadened, the, focus, of, public, health, from, individual, behaviors, and, risk, factors, to, population, level, issues, such, as, inequality, poverty, and, education, modern, public, health, is, often, concerned, with, addressing, determinants, of, health, across, a, population, there, is, a, recognition, that, health, is, affected, by, many, factors, including, class, race, income, educational, status, region, of, residence, and, social, relationships, these, are, known, as, social, determinants, of, health, the, upstream, drivers, such, as, environment, education, employment, income, food, security, housing, social, inclusion, and, many, others, effect, the, distribution, of, health, between, and, within, populations, and, are, often, shaped, by, policy, a, social, gradient, in, health, runs, through, society, the, poorest, generally, have, the, worst, health, but, even, the, middle, classes, will, generally, have, worse, health, outcomes, than, those, of, a, higher, social, level, the, new, public, health, advocates, for, population, based, policies, that, improve, health, in, an, equitable, manner, the, health, sector, is, one, of, europe, s, most, labor, intensive, industries, in, late, 2020, it, accounted, for, more, than, 21, million, employment, in, the, european, union, when, combined, with, social, work, according, to, the, who, several, countries, began, the, covid, 19, pandemic, with, insufficient, health, and, care, professionals, inappropriate, skill, mixtures, and, unequal, geographical, distributions, these, issues, were, worsened, by, the, pandemic, reiterating, the, importance, of, public, health, in, the, united, states, a, history, of, underinvestment, in, public, health, undermined, the, public, health, workforce, and, support, for, population, health, long, before, the, pandemic, added, to, stress, mental, distress, job, dissatisfaction, and, accelerated, departures, among, public, health, workers, health, aid, to, developing, countries, is, an, important, source, of, public, health, funding, for, many, developing, countries, health, aid, to, developing, countries, has, shown, a, significant, increase, after, world, war, ii, as, concerns, over, the, spread, of, disease, as, a, result, of, globalization, increased, and, the, hiv, aids, epidemic, in, sub, saharan, africa, surfaced, from, 1990, to, 2010, total, health, aid, from, developed, countries, increased, from, 5, 5, billion, to, 26, 87, billion, with, wealthy, countries, continuously, donating, billions, of, dollars, every, year, with, the, goal, of, improving, population, health, some, efforts, however, receive, a, significantly, larger, proportion, of, funds, such, as, hiv, which, received, an, increase, in, funds, of, over, 6, billion, between, 2000, and, 2010, which, was, more, than, twice, the, increase, seen, in, any, other, sector, during, those, years, health, aid, has, seen, an, expansion, through, multiple, channels, including, private, philanthropy, non, governmental, organizations, private, foundations, such, as, the, rockefeller, foundation, or, the, bill, melinda, gates, foundation, bilateral, donors, and, multilateral, donors, such, as, the, world, bank, or, unicef, the, result, has, been, a, sharp, rise, in, uncoordinated, and, fragmented, funding, of, an, ever, increasing, number, of, initiatives, and, projects, to, promote, better, strategic, cooperation, and, coordination, between, partners, particularly, among, bilateral, development, agencies, and, funding, organizations, the, swedish, international, development, cooperation, agency, sida, spearheaded, the, establishment, of, essence, an, initiative, to, facilitate, dialogue, between, donors, funders, allowing, them, to, identify, synergies, essence, brings, together, a, wide, range, of, funding, agencies, to, coordinate, funding, efforts, in, 2009, health, aid, from, the, oecd, amounted, to, 12, 47, billion, which, amounted, to, 11, 4, of, its, total, bilateral, aid, in, 2009, multilateral, donors, were, found, to, spend, 15, 3, of, their, total, aid, on, bettering, public, healthcare, debates, exist, questioning, the, efficacy, of, international, health, aid, supporters, of, aid, claim, that, health, aid, from, wealthy, countries, is, necessary, in, order, for, developing, countries, to, escape, the, poverty, trap, opponents, of, health, aid, claim, that, international, health, aid, actually, disrupts, developing, countries, course, of, development, causes, dependence, on, aid, and, in, many, cases, the, aid, fails, to, reach, its, recipients, for, example, recently, health, aid, was, funneled, towards, initiatives, such, as, financing, new, technologies, like, antiretroviral, medication, insecticide, treated, mosquito, nets, and, new, vaccines, the, positive, impacts, of, these, initiatives, can, be, seen, in, the, eradication, of, smallpox, and, polio, however, critics, claim, that, misuse, or, misplacement, of, funds, may, cause, many, of, these, efforts, to, never, come, into, achievement, economic, modeling, based, on, the, institute, for, health, metrics, and, evaluation, and, the, world, health, organization, has, shown, a, link, between, international, health, aid, in, developing, countries, and, a, reduction, in, adult, mortality, rates, however, a, 2014, 2016, study, suggests, that, a, potential, confounding, variable, for, this, outcome, is, the, possibility, that, aid, was, directed, at, countries, once, they, were, already, on, track, for, improvement, that, same, study, however, also, suggests, that, 1, billion, dollars, in, health, aid, was, associated, with, 364, 000, fewer, deaths, occurring, between, ages, 0, and, 5, in, 2011, to, address, current, and, future, challenges, in, addressing, health, issues, in, the, world, the, united, nations, have, developed, the, sustainable, development, goals, to, be, completed, by, 2030, these, goals, in, their, entirety, encompass, the, entire, spectrum, of, development, across, nations, however, goals, 1, 6, directly, address, health, disparities, primarily, in, developing, countries, these, six, goals, address, key, issues, in, global, public, health, poverty, hunger, and, food, security, health, education, gender, equality, and, women, s, empowerment, and, water, and, sanitation, public, health, officials, can, use, these, goals, to, set, their, own, agenda, and, plan, for, smaller, scale, initiatives, for, their, organizations, these, goals, are, designed, to, lessen, the, burden, of, disease, and, inequality, faced, by, developing, countries, and, lead, to, a, healthier, future, the, links, between, the, various, sustainable, development, goals, and, public, health, are, numerous, and, well, established, from, the, beginnings, of, human, civilization, communities, promoted, health, and, fought, disease, at, the, population, level, definitions, of, health, as, well, as, methods, to, pursue, it, differed, according, to, the, medical, religious, and, natural, philosophical, ideas, groups, held, the, resources, they, had, and, the, changing, circumstances, in, which, they, lived, yet, few, early, societies, displayed, the, hygienic, stagnation, or, even, apathy, often, attributed, to, them, the, latter, reputation, is, mainly, based, on, the, absence, of, present, day, bioindicators, especially, immunological, and, statistical, tools, developed, in, light, of, the, germ, theory, of, disease, transmission, public, health, was, born, neither, in, europe, nor, as, a, response, to, the, industrial, revolution, preventive, health, interventions, are, attested, almost, anywhere, historical, communities, have, left, their, mark, in, southeast, asia, for, instance, ayurvedic, medicine, and, subsequently, buddhism, fostered, occupational, dietary, and, sexual, regimens, that, promised, balanced, bodies, lives, and, communities, a, notion, strongly, present, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, as, well, among, the, mayans, aztecs, and, other, early, civilizations, in, the, americas, population, centers, pursued, hygienic, programs, including, by, holding, medicinal, herbal, markets, and, among, aboriginal, australians, techniques, for, preserving, and, protecting, water, and, food, sources, micro, zoning, to, reduce, pollution, and, fire, risks, and, screens, to, protect, people, against, flies, were, common, even, in, temporary, camps, western, european, byzantine, and, islamicate, civilizations, which, generally, adopted, a, hippocratic, galenic, or, humoral, medical, system, fostered, preventive, programs, as, well, these, were, developed, on, the, basis, of, evaluating, the, quality, of, local, climates, including, topography, wind, conditions, and, exposure, to, the, sun, and, the, properties, and, availability, of, water, and, food, for, both, humans, and, nonhuman, animals, diverse, authors, of, medical, architectural, engineering, and, military, manuals, explained, how, to, apply, such, theories, to, groups, of, different, origins, and, under, different, circumstances, this, was, crucial, since, under, galenism, bodily, constitutions, were, thought, to, be, heavily, shaped, by, their, material, environments, so, their, balance, required, specific, regimens, as, they, traveled, during, different, seasons, and, between, climate, zones, in, complex, pre, industrialized, societies, interventions, designed, to, reduce, health, risks, could, be, the, initiative, of, different, stakeholders, for, instance, in, greek, and, roman, antiquity, army, generals, learned, to, provide, for, soldiers, wellbeing, including, off, the, battlefield, where, most, combatants, died, prior, to, the, twentieth, century, in, christian, monasteries, across, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, western, europe, since, at, least, the, fifth, century, ce, monks, and, nuns, pursued, strict, but, balanced, regimens, including, nutritious, diets, developed, explicitly, to, extend, their, lives, and, royal, princely, and, papal, courts, which, were, often, mobile, as, well, likewise, adapted, their, behavior, to, suit, environmental, conditions, in, the, sites, they, occupied, they, could, also, choose, sites, they, considered, salubrious, for, their, members, and, sometimes, had, them, modified, in, cities, residents, and, rulers, developed, measures, to, benefit, the, general, population, which, faced, a, broad, array, of, recognized, health, risks, these, provide, some, of, the, most, sustained, evidence, for, preventive, measures, in, earlier, civilizations, in, numerous, sites, the, upkeep, of, infrastructures, including, roads, canals, and, marketplaces, as, well, as, zoning, policies, were, introduced, explicitly, to, preserve, residents, health, officials, such, as, the, muhtasib, in, the, middle, east, and, the, road, master, in, italy, fought, the, combined, threats, of, pollution, through, sin, ocular, intromission, and, miasma, craft, guilds, were, important, agents, of, waste, disposal, and, promoted, harm, reduction, through, honesty, and, labor, safety, among, their, members, medical, practitioners, including, public, physicians, collaborated, with, urban, governments, in, predicting, and, preparing, for, calamities, and, identifying, and, isolating, people, perceived, as, lepers, a, disease, with, strong, moral, connotations, neighborhoods, were, also, active, in, safeguarding, local, people, s, health, by, monitoring, at, risk, sites, near, them, and, taking, appropriate, social, and, legal, action, against, artisanal, polluters, and, neglectful, owners, of, animals, religious, institutions, individuals, and, charitable, organizations, in, both, islam, and, christianity, likewise, promoted, moral, and, physical, wellbeing, by, endowing, urban, amenities, such, as, wells, fountains, schools, and, bridges, also, in, the, service, of, pilgrims, in, western, europe, and, byzantium, religious, processions, commonly, took, place, which, purported, to, act, as, both, preventive, and, curative, measures, for, the, entire, community, urban, residents, and, other, groups, also, developed, preventive, measures, in, response, to, calamities, such, as, war, famine, floods, and, widespread, disease, during, and, after, the, black, death, 1346, 53, for, instance, inhabitants, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, western, europe, reacted, to, massive, population, decline, in, part, on, the, basis, of, existing, medical, theories, and, protocols, for, instance, concerning, meat, consumption, and, burial, and, in, part, by, developing, new, ones, the, latter, included, the, establishment, of, quarantine, facilities, and, health, boards, some, of, which, eventually, became, regular, urban, and, later, national, offices, subsequent, measures, for, protecting, cities, and, their, regions, included, issuing, health, passports, for, travelers, deploying, guards, to, create, sanitary, cordons, for, protecting, local, inhabitants, and, gathering, morbidity, and, mortality, statistics, such, measures, relied, in, turn, on, better, transportation, and, communication, networks, through, which, news, on, human, and, animal, disease, was, efficiently, spread, with, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, living, standards, amongst, the, working, population, began, to, worsen, with, cramped, and, unsanitary, urban, conditions, in, the, first, four, decades, of, the, 19th, century, alone, london, s, population, doubled, and, even, greater, growth, rates, were, recorded, in, the, new, industrial, towns, such, as, leeds, and, manchester, this, rapid, urbanization, exacerbated, the, spread, of, disease, in, the, large, conurbations, that, built, up, around, the, workhouses, and, factories, these, settlements, were, cramped, and, primitive, with, no, organized, sanitation, disease, was, inevitable, and, its, incubation, in, these, areas, was, encouraged, by, the, poor, lifestyle, of, the, inhabitants, unavailable, housing, led, to, the, rapid, growth, of, slums, and, the, per, capita, death, rate, began, to, rise, alarmingly, almost, doubling, in, birmingham, and, liverpool, thomas, malthus, warned, of, the, dangers, of, overpopulation, in, 1798, his, ideas, as, well, as, those, of, jeremy, bentham, became, very, influential, in, government, circles, in, the, early, years, of, the, 19th, century, the, latter, part, of, the, century, brought, the, establishment, of, the, basic, pattern, of, improvements, in, public, health, over, the, next, two, centuries, a, social, evil, was, identified, private, philanthropists, brought, attention, to, it, and, changing, public, opinion, led, to, government, action, the, 18th, century, saw, rapid, growth, in, voluntary, hospitals, in, england, the, practice, of, vaccination, began, in, the, 1800s, following, the, pioneering, work, of, edward, jenner, in, treating, smallpox, james, lind, s, discovery, of, the, causes, of, scurvy, amongst, sailors, and, its, mitigation, via, the, introduction, of, fruit, on, lengthy, voyages, was, published, in, 1754, and, led, to, the, adoption, of, this, idea, by, the, royal, navy, efforts, were, also, made, to, promulgate, health, matters, to, the, broader, public, in, 1752, the, british, physician, sir, john, pringle, published, observations, on, the, diseases, of, the, army, in, camp, and, garrison, in, which, he, advocated, for, the, importance, of, adequate, ventilation, in, the, military, barracks, and, the, provision, of, latrines, for, the, soldiers, the, first, attempts, at, sanitary, reform, and, the, establishment, of, public, health, institutions, were, made, in, the, 1840s, thomas, southwood, smith, physician, at, the, london, fever, hospital, began, to, write, papers, on, the, importance, of, public, health, and, was, one, of, the, first, physicians, brought, in, to, give, evidence, before, the, poor, law, commission, in, the, 1830s, along, with, neil, arnott, and, james, phillips, kay, smith, advised, the, government, on, the, importance, of, quarantine, and, sanitary, improvement, for, limiting, the, spread, of, infectious, diseases, such, as, cholera, and, yellow, fever, the, poor, law, commission, reported, in, 1838, that, the, expenditures, necessary, to, the, adoption, and, maintenance, of, measures, of, prevention, would, ultimately, amount, to, less, than, the, cost, of, the, disease, now, constantly, engendered, it, recommended, the, implementation, of, large, scale, government, engineering, projects, to, alleviate, the, conditions, that, allowed, for, the, propagation, of, disease, the, health, of, towns, association, was, formed, at, exeter, hall, london, on, 11, december, 1844, and, vigorously, campaigned, for, the, development, of, public, health, in, the, united, kingdom, its, formation, followed, the, 1843, establishment, of, the, health, of, towns, commission, chaired, by, sir, edwin, chadwick, which, produced, a, series, of, reports, on, poor, and, insanitary, conditions, in, british, cities, these, national, and, local, movements, led, to, the, public, health, act, finally, passed, in, 1848, it, aimed, to, improve, the, sanitary, condition, of, towns, and, populous, places, in, england, and, wales, by, placing, the, supply, of, water, sewerage, drainage, cleansing, and, paving, under, a, single, local, body, with, the, general, board, of, health, as, a, central, authority, the, act, was, passed, by, the, liberal, government, of, lord, john, russell, in, response, to, the, urging, of, edwin, chadwick, chadwick, s, seminal, report, on, the, sanitary, condition, of, the, labouring, population, was, published, in, 1842, and, was, followed, up, with, a, supplementary, report, a, year, later, during, this, time, james, newlands, appointed, following, the, passing, of, the, 1846, liverpool, sanatory, act, championed, by, the, borough, of, liverpool, health, of, towns, committee, designed, the, world, s, first, integrated, sewerage, system, in, liverpool, 1848, 1869, with, joseph, bazalgette, later, creating, london, s, sewerage, system, 1858, 1875, the, vaccination, act, 1853, introduced, compulsory, smallpox, vaccination, in, england, and, wales, by, 1871, legislation, required, a, comprehensive, system, of, registration, run, by, appointed, vaccination, officers, further, interventions, were, made, by, a, series, of, subsequent, public, health, acts, notably, the, 1875, act, reforms, included, the, building, of, sewers, the, regular, collection, of, garbage, followed, by, incineration, or, disposal, in, a, landfill, the, provision, of, clean, water, and, the, draining, of, standing, water, to, prevent, the, breeding, of, mosquitoes, the, infectious, disease, notification, act, 1889, 52, 53, vict, c, 72, mandated, the, reporting, of, infectious, diseases, to, the, local, sanitary, authority, which, could, then, pursue, measures, such, as, the, removal, of, the, patient, to, hospital, and, the, disinfection, of, homes, and, properties, in, the, united, states, the, first, public, health, organization, based, on, a, state, health, department, and, local, boards, of, health, was, founded, in, new, york, city, in, 1866, during, the, weimar, republic, germany, faced, many, public, health, catastrophes, the, nazi, party, had, a, goal, of, modernizing, health, care, with, volksgesundheit, german, for, people, s, public, health, this, modernization, was, based, on, the, growing, field, of, eugenics, and, measures, prioritizing, group, health, over, any, care, for, the, health, of, individuals, the, end, of, world, war, 2, led, to, the, nuremberg, code, a, set, of, research, ethics, concerning, human, experimentation, the, science, of, epidemiology, was, founded, by, john, snow, s, identification, of, a, polluted, public, water, well, as, the, source, of, an, 1854, cholera, outbreak, in, london, snow, believed, in, the, germ, theory, of, disease, as, opposed, to, the, prevailing, miasma, theory, by, talking, to, local, residents, with, the, help, of, reverend, henry, whitehead, he, identified, the, source, of, the, outbreak, as, the, public, water, pump, on, broad, street, now, broadwick, street, although, snow, s, chemical, and, microscope, examination, of, a, water, sample, from, the, broad, street, pump, did, not, conclusively, prove, its, danger, his, studies, of, the, pattern, of, the, disease, were, convincing, enough, to, persuade, the, local, council, to, close, the, well, pump, by, removing, its, handle, snow, later, used, a, dot, map, to, illustrate, the, cluster, of, cholera, cases, around, the, pump, he, also, used, statistics, to, illustrate, the, connection, between, the, quality, of, the, water, source, and, cholera, cases, he, showed, that, the, southwark, and, vauxhall, waterworks, company, was, taking, water, from, sewage, polluted, sections, of, the, thames, and, delivering, the, water, to, homes, leading, to, an, increased, incidence, of, cholera, snow, s, study, was, a, major, event, in, the, history, of, public, health, and, geography, it, is, regarded, as, the, founding, event, of, the, science, of, epidemiology, with, the, pioneering, work, in, bacteriology, of, french, chemist, louis, pasteur, and, german, scientist, robert, koch, methods, for, isolating, the, bacteria, responsible, for, a, given, disease, and, vaccines, for, remedy, were, developed, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, british, physician, ronald, ross, identified, the, mosquito, as, the, carrier, of, malaria, and, laid, the, foundations, for, combating, the, disease, joseph, lister, revolutionized, surgery, by, the, introduction, of, antiseptic, surgery, to, eliminate, infection, french, epidemiologist, paul, louis, simond, proved, that, plague, was, carried, by, fleas, on, the, back, of, rats, and, cuban, scientist, carlos, j, finlay, and, u, s, americans, walter, reed, and, james, carroll, demonstrated, that, mosquitoes, carry, the, virus, responsible, for, yellow, fever, 481, brazilian, scientist, carlos, chagas, identified, a, tropical, disease, and, its, vector, 481, education, and, training, of, public, health, professionals, is, available, throughout, the, world, in, schools, of, public, health, medical, schools, veterinary, schools, schools, of, nursing, and, schools, of, public, affairs, the, training, typically, requires, a, university, degree, with, a, focus, on, core, disciplines, of, biostatistics, epidemiology, health, services, administration, health, policy, health, education, behavioral, science, gender, issues, sexual, and, reproductive, health, public, health, nutrition, and, occupational, and, environmental, health, in, the, global, context, the, field, of, public, health, education, has, evolved, enormously, in, recent, decades, supported, by, institutions, such, as, the, world, health, organization, and, the, world, bank, among, others, operational, structures, are, formulated, by, strategic, principles, with, educational, and, career, pathways, guided, by, competency, frameworks, all, requiring, modulation, according, to, local, national, and, global, realities, moreover, integrating, technology, or, digital, platforms, to, connect, to, low, health, literacy, lhl, groups, could, be, a, way, to, increase, health, literacy, it, is, critically, important, for, the, health, of, populations, that, nations, assess, their, public, health, human, resource, needs, and, develop, their, ability, to, deliver, this, capacity, and, not, depend, on, other, countries, to, supply, it, in, the, united, states, the, welch, rose, report, of, 1915, has, been, viewed, as, the, basis, for, the, critical, movement, in, the, history, of, the, institutional, schism, between, public, health, and, medicine, because, it, led, to, the, establishment, of, schools, of, public, health, supported, by, the, rockefeller, foundation, the, report, was, authored, by, william, welch, founding, dean, of, the, johns, hopkins, bloomberg, school, of, public, health, and, wickliffe, rose, of, the, rockefeller, foundation, the, report, focused, more, on, research, than, practical, education, some, have, blamed, the, rockefeller, foundation, s, 1916, decision, to, support, the, establishment, of, schools, of, public, health, for, creating, the, schism, between, public, health, and, medicine, and, legitimizing, the, rift, between, medicine, s, laboratory, investigation, of, the, mechanisms, of, disease, and, public, health, s, nonclinical, concern, with, environmental, and, social, influences, on, health, and, wellness, even, though, schools, of, public, health, had, already, been, established, in, canada, europe, and, north, africa, the, united, states, had, still, maintained, the, traditional, system, of, housing, faculties, of, public, health, within, their, medical, institutions, a, 25, 000, donation, from, businessman, samuel, zemurray, instituted, the, school, of, public, health, and, tropical, medicine, at, tulane, university, in, 1912, conferring, its, first, doctor, of, public, health, degree, in, 1914, the, yale, school, of, public, health, was, founded, by, charles, edward, amory, winslow, in, 1915, the, johns, hopkins, school, of, hygiene, and, public, health, was, founded, in, 1916, and, became, an, independent, degree, granting, institution, for, research, and, training, in, public, health, and, the, largest, public, health, training, facility, in, the, united, states, by, 1922, schools, of, public, health, were, established, at, columbia, and, harvard, on, the, hopkins, model, by, 1999, there, were, twenty, nine, schools, of, public, health, in, the, us, enrolling, around, fifteen, thousand, students, over, the, years, the, types, of, students, and, training, provided, have, also, changed, in, the, beginning, students, who, enrolled, in, public, health, schools, typically, had, already, obtained, a, medical, degree, public, health, school, training, was, largely, a, second, degree, for, medical, professionals, however, in, 1978, 69, of, american, students, enrolled, in, public, health, schools, had, only, a, bachelor, s, degree, schools, of, public, health, offer, a, variety, of, degrees, generally, fall, into, two, categories, professional, or, academic, the, two, major, postgraduate, degrees, are, the, master, of, public, health, mph, or, the, master, of, science, in, public, health, msph, doctoral, studies, in, this, field, include, doctor, of, public, health, drph, and, doctor, of, philosophy, phd, in, a, subspecialty, of, greater, public, health, disciplines, drph, is, regarded, as, a, professional, degree, and, phd, as, more, of, an, academic, degree, professional, degrees, are, oriented, towards, practice, in, public, health, settings, the, master, of, public, health, doctor, of, public, health, doctor, of, health, science, dhsc, dhs, and, the, master, of, health, care, administration, are, examples, of, degrees, which, are, geared, towards, people, who, want, careers, as, practitioners, of, public, health, in, health, departments, managed, care, and, community, based, organizations, hospitals, and, consulting, firms, among, others, master, of, public, health, degrees, broadly, fall, into, two, categories, those, that, put, more, emphasis, on, an, understanding, of, epidemiology, and, statistics, as, the, scientific, basis, of, public, health, practice, and, those, that, include, a, more, wide, range, of, methodologies, a, master, of, science, of, public, health, is, similar, to, an, mph, but, is, considered, an, academic, degree, as, opposed, to, a, professional, degree, and, places, more, emphasis, on, scientific, methods, and, research, the, same, distinction, can, be, made, between, the, drph, and, the, dhsc, the, drph, is, considered, a, professional, degree, and, the, dhsc, is, an, academic, degree, academic, degrees, are, more, oriented, towards, those, with, interests, in, the, scientific, basis, of, public, health, and, preventive, medicine, who, wish, to, pursue, careers, in, research, university, teaching, in, graduate, programs, policy, analysis, and, development, and, other, high, level, public, health, positions, examples, of, academic, degrees, are, the, master, of, science, doctor, of, philosophy, doctor, of, science, scd, and, doctor, of, health, science, dhsc, the, doctoral, programs, are, distinct, from, the, mph, and, other, professional, programs, by, the, addition, of, advanced, coursework, and, the, nature, and, scope, of, a, dissertation, research, project, in, canada, the, public, health, agency, of, canada, is, the, national, agency, responsible, for, public, health, emergency, preparedness, and, response, and, infectious, and, chronic, disease, control, and, prevention, since, the, 1959, cuban, revolution, the, cuban, government, has, devoted, extensive, resources, to, the, improvement, of, health, conditions, for, its, entire, population, via, universal, access, to, health, care, infant, mortality, has, plummeted, 483, cuban, medical, internationalism, as, a, policy, has, seen, the, cuban, government, sent, doctors, as, a, form, of, aid, and, export, to, countries, in, need, in, latin, america, especially, venezuela, as, well, as, oceania, and, africa, countries, public, health, was, important, elsewhere, in, latin, america, in, consolidating, state, power, and, integrating, marginalized, populations, into, the, nation, state, in, colombia, public, health, was, a, means, for, creating, and, implementing, ideas, of, citizenship, in, bolivia, a, similar, push, came, after, their, 1952, revolution, though, curable, and, preventive, malaria, remains, a, major, public, health, issue, and, is, the, third, leading, cause, of, death, in, ghana, in, the, absence, of, a, vaccine, mosquito, control, or, access, to, anti, malaria, medication, public, health, methods, become, the, main, strategy, for, reducing, the, prevalence, and, severity, of, malaria, these, methods, include, reducing, breeding, sites, screening, doors, and, windows, insecticide, sprays, prompt, treatment, following, infection, and, usage, of, insecticide, treated, mosquito, nets, distribution, and, sale, of, insecticide, treated, mosquito, nets, is, a, common, cost, effective, anti, malaria, public,
