the, lungs, are, the, main, organs, of, the, respiratory, system, in, most, terrestrial, animals, including, all, tetrapod, vertebrates, and, a, small, number, of, amphibious, fish, lungfish, and, bichirs, pulmonate, gastropods, land, snails, and, slugs, which, have, analogous, pallial, lungs, and, some, arachnids, tetrapulmonates, such, as, spiders, and, scorpions, which, have, book, lungs, their, function, is, to, conduct, gas, exchange, by, extracting, oxygen, from, the, air, into, the, bloodstream, via, diffusion, and, to, release, carbon, dioxide, from, the, bloodstream, out, into, the, atmosphere, a, process, also, known, as, respiration, this, article, primarily, concerns, with, the, lungs, of, tetrapods, particularly, those, of, humans, which, are, paired, and, located, on, either, side, of, the, heart, occupying, most, of, the, volume, of, the, thoracic, cavity, and, are, homologous, to, the, swim, bladders, in, ray, finned, fish, the, movements, of, air, in, and, out, of, the, lungs, is, called, ventilation, or, breathing, which, is, driven, by, different, muscular, systems, in, different, species, amniotes, like, mammals, reptiles, and, birds, use, different, dedicated, respiratory, muscles, to, facilitate, breathing, while, in, primitive, tetrapods, air, was, driven, into, the, lungs, by, the, pharyngeal, muscles, via, buccal, pumping, a, mechanism, still, seen, in, amphibians, in, humans, the, main, muscles, of, respiration, that, drives, breathing, are, the, diaphragm, and, intercostal, muscles, while, other, core, and, limb, muscles, might, also, be, recruited, as, accessory, muscles, in, situations, of, respiratory, distress, the, lungs, also, provide, airflow, that, makes, vocalization, including, human, speech, possible, human, lungs, like, other, tetrapods, are, paired, with, one, on, the, left, and, one, on, the, right, due, to, the, leftward, rotation, of, the, heart, the, right, lung, is, bigger, and, heavier, than, the, left, and, the, two, lungs, together, weigh, approximately, 1, 3, kilograms, 2, 9, lb, the, lungs, are, part, of, the, lower, respiratory, tract, that, begins, at, the, trachea, and, branches, into, the, bronchi, and, bronchioles, and, which, receive, fresh, air, inhaled, breathed, in, via, the, conducting, zone, the, conducting, zone, ends, at, the, terminal, bronchioles, which, divide, into, the, respiratory, bronchioles, of, the, respiratory, zone, and, further, divide, into, alveolar, ducts, that, give, rise, to, the, alveolar, sacs, that, contain, the, alveoli, where, majority, of, gas, exchange, takes, place, alveoli, are, also, sparsely, present, on, the, walls, of, the, respiratory, bronchioles, and, alveolar, ducts, together, the, lungs, contain, approximately, 2, 400, kilometres, 1, 500, mi, of, airways, and, 300, to, 500, million, alveoli, each, lung, is, enveloped, by, a, serous, membranes, called, pleurae, which, also, overlays, the, inside, surface, of, the, rib, cage, the, two, membranes, called, the, visceral, and, parietal, pleurae, respectively, form, an, enclosing, sac, known, as, the, pleural, cavity, which, contains, a, lubricating, film, of, serous, fluid, pleural, fluid, that, separates, the, two, pleurae, and, reduces, the, friction, of, sliding, movements, between, them, allowing, for, easier, expansion, of, the, lungs, during, breathing, the, visceral, pleura, also, invaginates, into, each, lung, as, fissures, which, divides, the, lung, into, independent, sections, called, lobes, the, right, lung, typically, has, three, lobes, and, the, left, has, two, the, lobes, are, further, divided, into, bronchopulmonary, segments, and, pulmonary, lobules, the, lungs, have, two, unique, blood, supplies, the, pulmonary, circulation, which, receives, deoxygenated, blood, from, the, right, heart, via, the, pulmonary, arteries, exchanges, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, across, the, alveolar, capillary, barrier, before, returning, the, re, oxygenated, blood, to, the, left, heart, via, the, pulmonary, veins, for, pumping, to, the, rest, of, the, body, and, the, bronchial, circulation, which, is, part, of, the, systemic, circulation, that, provides, a, separate, supply, of, oxygenated, blood, to, the, tissue, of, the, lungs, the, lung, can, be, affected, by, a, number, of, respiratory, diseases, including, pneumonia, pulmonary, fibrosis, and, lung, cancer, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, includes, chronic, bronchitis, and, emphysema, and, are, commonly, related, to, smoking, or, exposure, to, air, pollutants, a, number, of, occupational, lung, diseases, can, be, caused, by, substances, such, as, coal, dust, asbestos, fibres, and, crystalline, silica, dust, diseases, such, as, acute, bronchitis, and, asthma, can, also, affect, lung, function, although, such, conditions, are, technically, airway, diseases, rather, than, lung, diseases, medical, terms, related, to, the, lung, often, begin, with, pulmo, from, the, latin, pulmonarius, meaning, of, the, lungs, as, in, pulmonology, or, with, pneumo, from, greek, meaning, lung, as, in, pneumonia, in, embryonic, development, the, lungs, begin, to, develop, as, an, outpouching, of, the, foregut, a, tube, which, goes, on, to, form, the, upper, part, of, the, digestive, system, when, the, lungs, are, formed, the, fetus, is, held, in, the, fluid, filled, amniotic, sac, and, so, they, do, not, function, to, breathe, blood, is, also, diverted, from, the, lungs, through, the, ductus, arteriosus, at, birth, air, begins, to, pass, through, the, lungs, and, the, diversionary, duct, closes, so, that, the, lungs, can, begin, to, respire, the, lungs, only, fully, develop, in, early, childhood, the, lungs, are, located, in, the, chest, on, either, side, of, the, heart, in, the, rib, cage, they, are, conical, in, shape, with, a, narrow, rounded, apex, at, the, top, and, a, broad, concave, base, that, rests, on, the, convex, surface, of, the, diaphragm, the, apex, of, the, lung, extends, into, the, root, of, the, neck, reaching, shortly, above, the, level, of, the, sternal, end, of, the, first, rib, the, lungs, stretch, from, close, to, the, backbone, in, the, rib, cage, to, the, front, of, the, chest, and, downwards, from, the, lower, part, of, the, trachea, to, the, diaphragm, the, left, lung, shares, space, with, the, heart, and, has, an, indentation, in, its, border, called, the, cardiac, notch, of, the, left, lung, to, accommodate, this, the, front, and, outer, sides, of, the, lungs, face, the, ribs, which, make, light, indentations, on, their, surfaces, the, medial, surfaces, of, the, lungs, face, towards, the, centre, of, the, chest, and, lie, against, the, heart, great, vessels, and, the, carina, where, the, trachea, divides, into, the, two, main, bronchi, the, cardiac, impression, is, an, indentation, formed, on, the, surfaces, of, the, lungs, where, they, rest, against, the, heart, both, lungs, have, a, central, recession, called, the, hilum, where, the, blood, vessels, and, airways, pass, into, the, lungs, making, up, the, root, of, the, lung, there, are, also, bronchopulmonary, lymph, nodes, on, the, hilum, the, lungs, are, surrounded, by, the, pulmonary, pleurae, the, pleurae, are, two, serous, membranes, the, outer, parietal, pleura, lines, the, inner, wall, of, the, rib, cage, and, the, inner, visceral, pleura, directly, lines, the, surface, of, the, lungs, between, the, pleurae, is, a, potential, space, called, the, pleural, cavity, containing, a, thin, layer, of, lubricating, pleural, fluid, middle, lower, lingula, lower, each, lung, is, divided, into, sections, called, lobes, by, the, infoldings, of, the, visceral, pleura, as, fissures, lobes, are, divided, into, segments, and, segments, have, further, divisions, as, lobules, there, are, three, lobes, in, the, right, lung, and, two, lobes, in, the, left, lung, the, fissures, are, formed, in, early, prenatal, development, by, invaginations, of, the, visceral, pleura, that, divide, the, lobar, bronchi, and, section, the, lungs, into, lobes, that, helps, in, their, expansion, the, right, lung, is, divided, into, three, lobes, by, a, horizontal, fissure, and, an, oblique, fissure, the, left, lung, is, divided, into, two, lobes, by, an, oblique, fissure, which, is, closely, aligned, with, the,

the, lower, lobe, from, the, middle, and, upper, lobes, variations, in, the, fissures, are, fairly, common, being, either, incompletely, formed, or, present, as, an, extra, fissure, as, in, the, azygos, fissure, or, absent, incomplete, fissures, are, responsible, for, interlobar, collateral, ventilation, airflow, between, lobes, which, is, unwanted, in, some, lung, volume, reduction, procedures, the, main, or, primary, bronchi, enter, the, lungs, at, the, hilum, and, initially, branch, into, secondary, bronchi, also, known, as, lobar, bronchi, that, supply, air, to, each, lobe, of, the, lung, the, lobar, bronchi, branch, into, tertiary, bronchi, also, known, as, segmental, bronchi, and, these, supply, air, to, the, further, divisions, of, the, lobes, known, as, bronchopulmonary, segments, each, bronchopulmonary, segment, has, its, own, segmental, bronchus, and, arterial, supply, segments, for, the, left, and, right, lung, are, shown, in, the, table, the, segmental, anatomy, is, useful, clinically, for, localising, disease, processes, in, the, lungs, a, segment, is, a, discrete, unit, that, can, be, surgically, removed, without, seriously, affecting, surrounding, tissue, the, right, lung, has, both, more, lobes, and, segments, than, the, left, it, is, divided, into, three, lobes, an, upper, middle, and, a, lower, lobe, by, two, fissures, one, oblique, and, one, horizontal, the, upper, horizontal, fissure, separates, the, upper, from, the, middle, lobe, it, begins, in, the, lower, oblique, fissure, near, the, posterior, border, of, the, lung, and, running, horizontally, forward, cuts, the, anterior, border, on, a, level, with, the, sternal, end, of, the, fourth, costal, cartilage, on, the, mediastinal, surface, it, may, be, traced, back, to, the, hilum, the, lower, oblique, fissure, separates, the, lower, from, the, middle, and, upper, lobes, and, is, closely, aligned, with, the, oblique, fissure, in, the, left, lung, the,

lung, is, an, arched, groove, for, the, azygos, vein, and, above, this, is, a, wide, groove, for, the, superior, vena, cava, and, right, brachiocephalic, vein, behind, this, and, close, to, the, top, of, the, lung, is, a, groove, for, the, brachiocephalic, artery, there, is, a, groove, for, the, esophagus, behind, the, hilum, and, the, pulmonary, ligament, and, near, the, lower, part, of, the, esophageal, groove, is, a, deeper, groove, for, the, inferior, vena, cava, before, it, enters, the, heart, the, weight, of, the, right, lung, varies, between, individuals, with, a, standard, reference, range, in, men, of, 155, 720, g, 0, 342, 1, 587, lb, and, in, women, of, 100, 590, g, 0, 22, 1, 30, lb, the, left, lung, is, divided, into, two, lobes, an, upper, and, a, lower, lobe, by, the, oblique, fissure, which, extends, from, the, costal, to, the, mediastinal, surface, of, the, lung, both, above, and, below, the, hilum, the, left, lung, unlike, the, right, does, not, have, a, middle, lobe, though, it, does, have, a, homologous, feature, a, projection, of, the, upper, lobe, termed, the, lingula, its, name, means, little, tongue, the, lingula, on, the, left, lung, serves, as, an, anatomic, parallel, to, the, middle, lobe, on, the, right, lung, with, both, areas, being, predisposed, to, similar, infections, and, anatomic, complications, there, are, two, bronchopulmonary, segments, of, the, lingula, superior, and, inferior, the, mediastinal, surface, of, the, left, lung, has, a, large, cardiac, impression, where, the, heart, sits, this, is, deeper,

the, aortic, arch, and, a, groove, below, it, for, the, descending, aorta, the, left, subclavian, artery, a, branch, off, the, aortic, arch, sits, in, a, groove, from, the, arch, to, near, the, apex, of, the, lung, a, shallower, groove, in, front, of, the, artery, and, near, the, edge, of, the, lung, lodges, the, left, brachiocephalic, vein, the, esophagus, may, sit, in, a, wider, shallow, impression, at, the, base, of, the, lung, by, standard, reference, range, the, weight, of, the, left, lung, is, 110, 675, g, 0, 243, 1, 488, lb, in, men, and, 105, 515, g, 0, 231, 1, 135, lb, in, women, the, lungs, are, part, of, the, lower, respiratory, tract, and, accommodate, the, bronchial, airways, when, they, branch, from, the, trachea, the, bronchial, airways, terminate, in, alveoli, which, make, up, the, functional, tissue, parenchyma, of, the, lung, and, veins, arteries, nerves, and, lymphatic, vessels, the, trachea, and, bronchi, have, plexuses, of, lymph, capillaries, in, their, mucosa, and, submucosa, the, smaller, bronchi, have, a, single, layer, of, lymph, capillaries, and, they, are, absent, in, the, alveoli, the, lungs, are, supplied, with, the, largest, lymphatic, drainage, system, of, any, other, organ, in, the, body, each, lung, is, surrounded, by, a, serous, membrane, of, visceral, pleura, which, has, an, underlying, layer, of, loose, connective, tissue, attached, to, the, substance, of, the, lung, the, connective, tissue, of, the, lungs, is, made, up, of, elastic, and, collagen, fibres, that, are, interspersed, between, the, capillaries, and, the, alveolar, walls, elastin, is, the, key, protein, of, the, extracellular, matrix, and, is, the, main, component, of, the, elastic, fibres, elastin, gives, the, necessary, elasticity, and, resilience, required, for, the, persistent, stretching, involved, in, breathing, known, as, lung, compliance, it, is, also, responsible, for, the, elastic, recoil, needed, elastin, is, more, concentrated, in, areas, of, high, stress, such, as, the, openings, of, the, alveoli, and, alveolar, junctions, the, connective, tissue, links, all, the, alveoli, to, form, the, lung, parenchyma, which, has, a, sponge, like, appearance, the, alveoli, have, interconnecting, air, passages, in, their, walls, known, as, the, pores, of, kohn, all, of, the, lower, respiratory, tract, including, the, trachea, bronchi, and, bronchioles, is, lined, with, respiratory, epithelium, this, is, a, ciliated, epithelium, interspersed, with, goblet, cells, which, produce, mucin, the, main, component, of, mucus, ciliated, cells, basal, cells, and, in, the, terminal, bronchioles, club, cells, with, actions, similar, to, basal, cells, and, macrophages, the, epithelial, cells, and, the, submucosal, glands, throughout, the, respiratory, tract, secrete, airway, surface, liquid, asl, the, composition, of, which, is, tightly, regulated, and, determines, how, well, mucociliary, clearance, works, pulmonary, neuroendocrine, cells, are, found, throughout, the, respiratory, epithelium, including, the, alveolar, epithelium, though, they, only, account, for, around, 0, 5, percent, of, the, total, epithelial, population, pnecs, are, innervated, airway, epithelial, cells, that, are, particularly, focused, at, airway, junction, points, these, cells, can, produce, serotonin, dopamine, and, norepinephrine, as, well, as, polypeptide, products, cytoplasmic, processes, from, the, pulmonary, neuroendocrine, cells, extend, into, the, airway, lumen, where, they, may, sense, the, composition, of, inspired, gas, in, the, bronchi, there, are, incomplete, tracheal, rings, of, cartilage, and, smaller, plates, of, cartilage, that, keep, them, open, 472, bronchioles, are, too, narrow, to, support, cartilage, and, their, walls, are, of, smooth, muscle, and, this, is, largely, absent, in, the, narrower, respiratory, bronchioles, which, are, mainly, just, of, epithelium, 472, the, absence, of, cartilage, in, the, terminal, bronchioles, gives, them, an, alternative, name, of, membranous, bronchioles, the, conducting, zone, of, the, respiratory, tract, ends, at, the, terminal, bronchioles, when, they, branch, into, the, respiratory, bronchioles, this, marks, the, beginning, of, the, terminal, respiratory, unit, called, the, acinus, which, includes, the, respiratory, bronchioles, the, alveolar, ducts, alveolar, sacs, and, alveoli, an, acinus, measures, up, to, 10, mm, in, diameter, a, primary, pulmonary, lobule, is, the, part, of, the, lung, distal, to, the, respiratory, bronchiole, thus, it, includes, the, alveolar, ducts, sacs, and, alveoli, but, not, the, respiratory, bronchioles, the, unit, described, as, the, secondary, pulmonary, lobule, is, the, lobule, most, referred, to, as, the, pulmonary, lobule, or, respiratory, lobule, 489, this, lobule, is, a, discrete, unit, that, is, the, smallest, component, of, the, lung, that, can, be, seen, without, aid, the, secondary, pulmonary, lobule, is, likely, to, be, made, up, of, between, 30, and, 50, primary, lobules, the, lobule, is, supplied, by, a, terminal, bronchiole, that, branches, into, respiratory, bronchioles, the, respiratory, bronchioles, supply, the, alveoli, in, each, acinus, and, is, accompanied, by, a, pulmonary, artery, branch, each, lobule, is, enclosed, by, an, interlobular, septum, each, acinus, is, incompletely, separated, by, an, intralobular, septum, the, respiratory, bronchiole, gives, rise, to, the, alveolar, ducts, that, lead, to, the, alveolar, sacs, which, contain, two, or, more, alveoli, the, walls, of, the, alveoli, are, extremely, thin, allowing, a, fast, rate, of, diffusion, the, alveoli, have, interconnecting, small, air, passages, in, their, walls, known, as, the, pores, of, kohn, alveoli, consist, of, two, types, of, alveolar, cell, and, an, alveolar, macrophage, the, two, types, of, cell, are, known, as, type, i, and, type, ii, cells, also, known, as, pneumocytes, types, i, and, ii, make, up, the, walls, and, alveolar, septa, type, i, cells, provide, 95, of, the, surface, area, of, each, alveoli, and, are, flat, squamous, and, type, ii, cells, generally, cluster, in, the, corners, of, the, alveoli, and, have, a, cuboidal, shape, despite, this, cells, occur, in, a, roughly, equal, ratio, of, 1, 1, or, 6, 4, type, i, are, squamous, epithelial, cells, that, make, up, the, alveolar, wall, structure, they, have, extremely, thin, walls, that, enable, an, easy, gas, exchange, these, type, i, cells, also, make, up, the, alveolar, septa, which, separate, each, alveolus, the, septa, consist, of, an, epithelial, lining, and, associated, basement, membranes, type, i, cells, are, not, able, to, divide, and, consequently, rely, on, differentiation, from, type, ii, cells, type, ii, are, larger, and, they, line, the, alveoli, and, produce, and, secrete, epithelial, lining, fluid, and, lung, surfactant, type, ii, cells, are, able, to, divide, and, differentiate, to, type, i, cells, the, alveolar, macrophages, have, an, important, role, in, the, immune, system, they, remove, substances, which, deposit, in, the, alveoli, including, loose, red, blood, cells, that, have, been, forced, out, from, blood, vessels, there, is, a, large, presence, of, microorganisms, in, the, lungs, known, as, the, lung, microbiota, that, interacts, with, the, airway, epithelial, cells, an, interaction, of, probable, importance, in, maintaining, homeostasis, the, microbiota, is, complex, and, dynamic, in, healthy, people, and, altered, in, diseases, such, as, asthma, and, copd, for, example, significant, changes, can, take, place, in, copd, following, infection, with, rhinovirus, fungal, genera, that, are, commonly, found, as, mycobiota, in, the, microbiota, include, candida, malassezia, saccharomyces, and, aspergillus, the, lower, respiratory, tract, is, part, of, the, respiratory, system, and, consists, of, the, trachea, and, the, structures, below, this, including, the, lungs, the, trachea, receives, air, from, the, pharynx, and, travels, down, to, a, place, where, it, splits, the, carina, into, a, right, and, left, primary, bronchus, these, supply, air, to, the, right, and, left, lungs, splitting, progressively, into, the, secondary, and, tertiary, bronchi, for, the, lobes, of, the, lungs, and, into, smaller, and, smaller, bronchioles, until, they, become, the, respiratory, bronchioles, these, in, turn, supply, air, through, alveolar, ducts, into, the, alveoli, where, the, exchange, of, gases, take, place, oxygen, breathed, in, diffuses, through, the, walls, of, the, alveoli, into, the, enveloping, capillaries, and, into, the, circulation, and, carbon, dioxide, diffuses, from, the, blood, into, the, lungs, to, be, breathed, out, estimates, of, the, total, surface, area, of, lungs, vary, from, 50, to, 75, square, metres, 540, to, 810, sq, ft, although, this, is, often, quoted, in, textbooks, and, the, media, being, the, size, of, a, tennis, court, it, is, actually, less, than, half, the, size, of, a, singles, court, the, bronchi, in, the, conducting, zone, are, reinforced, with, hyaline, cartilage, in, order, to, hold, open, the, airways, the, bronchioles, have, no, cartilage, and, are, surrounded, instead, by, smooth, muscle, air, is, warmed, to, 37, c, 99, f, humidified, and, cleansed, by, the, conducting, zone, particles, from, the, air, being, removed, by, the, cilia, on, the, respiratory, epithelium, lining, the, passageways, in, a, process, called, mucociliary, clearance, pulmonary, stretch, receptors, in, the, smooth, muscle, of, the, airways, initiate, a, reflex, known, as, the, hering, breuer, reflex, that, prevents, the, lungs, from, over, inflation, during, forceful, inspiration, the, lungs, have, a, dual, blood, supply, provided, by, a, bronchial, and, a, pulmonary, circulation, the, bronchial, circulation, supplies, oxygenated, blood, to, the, airways, of, the, lungs, through, the, bronchial, arteries, that, leave, the, aorta, there, are, usually, three, arteries, two, to, the, left, lung, and, one, to, the, right, and, they, branch, alongside, the, bronchi, and, bronchioles, the, pulmonary, circulation, carries, deoxygenated, blood, from, the, heart, to, the, lungs, and, returns, the, oxygenated, blood, to, the, heart, to, supply, the, rest, of, the, body, the, blood, volume, of, the, lungs, is, about, 450, millilitres, on, average, about, 9, of, the, total, blood, volume, of, the, entire, circulatory, system, this, quantity, can, easily, fluctuate, from, between, one, half, and, twice, the, normal, volume, also, in, the, event, of, blood, loss, through, hemorrhage, blood, from, the, lungs, can, partially, compensate, by, automatically, transferring, to, the, systemic, circulation, the, lungs, are, supplied, by, nerves, of, the, autonomic, nervous, system, input, from, the, parasympathetic, nervous, system, occurs, via, the, vagus, nerve, when, stimulated, by, acetylcholine, this, causes, constriction, of, the, smooth, muscle, lining, the, bronchus, and, bronchioles, and, increases, the, secretions, from, glands, the, lungs, also, have, a, sympathetic, tone, from, norepinephrine, acting, on, the, beta, 2, adrenoceptors, in, the, respiratory, tract, which, causes, bronchodilation, the, action, of, breathing, takes, place, because, of, nerve, signals, sent, by, the, respiratory, center, in, the, brainstem, along, the, phrenic, nerve, from, the, cervical, plexus, to, the, diaphragm, the, lobes, of, the, lung, are, subject, to, anatomical, variations, a, horizontal, interlobar, fissure, was, found, to, be, incomplete, in, 25, of, right, lungs, or, even, absent, in, 11, of, all, cases, an, accessory, fissure, was, also, found, in, 14, and, 22, of, left, and, right, lungs, respectively, an, oblique, fissure, was, found, to, be, incomplete, in, 21, to, 47, of, left, lungs, in, some, cases, a, fissure, is, absent, or, extra, resulting, in, a, right, lung, with, only, two, lobes, or, a, left, lung, with, three, lobes, a, variation, in, the, airway, branching, structure, has, been, found, specifically, in, the, central, airway, branching, this, variation, is, associated, with, the, development, of, copd, in, adulthood, the, development, of, the, human, lungs, arise, from, the, laryngotracheal, groove, and, develop, to, maturity, over, several, weeks, in, the, foetus, and, for, several, years, following, birth, the, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and, lungs, that, make, up, the, respiratory, tract, begin, to, form, during, the, fourth, week, of, embryogenesis, from, the, lung, bud, which, appears, ventrally, to, the, caudal, portion, of, the, foregut, the, respiratory, tract, has, a, branching, structure, and, is, also, known, as, the, respiratory, tree, in, the, embryo, this, structure, is, developed, in, the, process, of, branching, morphogenesis, and, is, generated, by, the, repeated, splitting, of, the, tip, of, the, branch, in, the, development, of, the, lungs, as, in, some, other, organs, the, epithelium, forms, branching, tubes, the, lung, has, a, left, right, symmetry, and, each, bud, known, as, a, bronchial, bud, grows, out, as, a, tubular, epithelium, that, becomes, a, bronchus, each, bronchus, branches, into, bronchioles, the, branching, is, a, result, of, the, tip, of, each, tube, bifurcating, the, branching, process, forms, the, bronchi, bronchioles, and, ultimately, the, alveoli, the, four, genes, mostly, associated, with, branching, morphogenesis, in, the, lung, are, the, intercellular, signalling, protein, sonic, hedgehog, shh, fibroblast, growth, factors, fgf10, and, fgfr2b, and, bone, morphogenetic, protein, bmp4, fgf10, is, seen, to, have, the, most, prominent, role, fgf10, is, a, paracrine, signalling, molecule, needed, for, epithelial, branching, and, shh, inhibits, fgf10, the, development, of, the, alveoli, is, influenced, by, a, different, mechanism, whereby, continued, bifurcation, is, stopped, and, the, distal, tips, become, dilated, to, form, the, alveoli, at, the, end, of, the, fourth, week, the, lung, bud, divides, into, two, the, right, and, left, primary, bronchial, buds, on, each, side, of, the, trachea, during, the, fifth, week, the, right, bud, branches, into, three, secondary, bronchial, buds, and, the, left, branches, into, two, secondary, bronchial, buds, these, give, rise, to, the, lobes, of, the, lungs, three, on, the, right, and, two, on, the, left, over, the, following, week, the, secondary, buds, branch, into, tertiary, buds, about, ten, on, each, side, from, the, sixth, week, to, the, sixteenth, week, the, major, elements, of, the, lungs, appear, except, the, alveoli, from, week, 16, to, week, 26, the, bronchi, enlarge, and, lung, tissue, becomes, highly, vascularised, bronchioles, and, alveolar, ducts, also, develop, by, week, 26, the, terminal, bronchioles, have, formed, which, branch, into, two, respiratory, bronchioles, during, the, period, covering, the, 26th, week, until, birth, the, important, blood, air, barrier, is, established, specialised, type, i, alveolar, cells, where, gas, exchange, will, take, place, together, with, the, type, ii, alveolar, cells, that, secrete, pulmonary, surfactant, appear, the, surfactant, reduces, the, surface, tension, at, the, air, alveolar, surface, which, allows, expansion, of, the, alveolar, sacs, the, alveolar, sacs, contain, the, primitive, alveoli, that, form, at, the, end, of, the, alveolar, ducts, and, their, appearance, around, the, seventh, month, marks, the, point, at, which, limited, respiration, would, be, possible, and, the, premature, baby, could, survive, the, developing, lung, is, particularly, vulnerable, to, changes, in, the, levels, of, vitamin, a, vitamin, a, deficiency, has, been, linked, to, changes, in, the, epithelial, lining, of, the, lung, and, in, the, lung, parenchyma, this, can, disrupt, the, normal, physiology, of, the, lung, and, predispose, to, respiratory, diseases, severe, nutritional, deficiency, in, vitamin, a, results, in, a, reduction, in, the, formation, of, the, alveolar, walls, septa, and, to, notable, changes, in, the, respiratory, epithelium, alterations, are, noted, in, the, extracellular, matrix, and, in, the, protein, content, of, the, basement, membrane, the, extracellular, matrix, maintains, lung, elasticity, the, basement, membrane, is, associated, with, alveolar, epithelium, and, is, important, in, the, blood, air, barrier, the, deficiency, is, associated, with, functional, defects, and, disease, states, vitamin, a, is, crucial, in, the, development, of, the, alveoli, which, continues, for, several, years, after, birth, at, birth, the, baby, s, lungs, are, filled, with, fluid, secreted, by, the, lungs, and, are, not, inflated, after, birth, the, infant, s, central, nervous, system, reacts, to, the, sudden, change, in, temperature, and, environment, this, triggers, the, first, breath, within, about, 10, seconds, after, delivery, before, birth, the, lungs, are, filled, with, fetal, lung, fluid, after, the, first, breath, the, fluid, is, quickly, absorbed, into, the, body, or, exhaled, the, resistance, in, the, lung, s, blood, vessels, decreases, giving, an, increased, surface, area, for, gas, exchange, and, the, lungs, begin, to, breathe, spontaneously, this, accompanies, other, changes, which, result, in, an, increased, amount, of, blood, entering, the, lung, tissues, at, birth, the, lungs, are, very, undeveloped, with, only, around, one, sixth, of, the, alveoli, of, the, adult, lung, present, the, alveoli, continue, to, form, into, early, adulthood, and, their, ability, to, form, when, necessary, is, seen, in, the, regeneration, of, the, lung, alveolar, septa, have, a, double, capillary, network, instead, of, the, single, network, of, the, developed, lung, only, after, the, maturation, of, the, capillary, network, can, the, lung, enter, a, normal, phase, of, growth, following, the, early, growth, in, numbers, of, alveoli, there, is, another, stage, of, the, alveoli, being, enlarged, the, major, function, of, the, lungs, is, gas, exchange, between, the, lungs, and, the, blood, the, alveolar, and, pulmonary, capillary, gases, equilibrate, across, the, thin, blood, air, barrier, this, thin, membrane, about, 0, 5, 2, m, thick, is, folded, into, about, 300, million, alveoli, providing, an, extremely, large, surface, area, estimates, varying, between, 70, and, 145, m, 2, for, gas, exchange, to, occur, the, lungs, are, not, capable, of, expanding, to, breathe, on, their, own, and, will, only, do, so, when, there, is, an, increase, in, the, volume, of, the, thoracic, cavity, this, is, achieved, by, the, muscles, of, respiration, through, the, contraction, of, the, diaphragm, and, the, intercostal, muscles, which, pull, the, rib, cage, upwards, as, shown, in, the, diagram, during, breathing, out, the, muscles, relax, returning, the, lungs, to, their, resting, position, at, this, point, the, lungs, contain, the, functional, residual, capacity, frc, of, air, which, in, the, adult, human, has, a, volume, of, about, 2, 5, 3, 0, litres, during, heavy, breathing, as, in, exertion, a, large, number, of, accessory, muscles, in, the, neck, and, abdomen, are, recruited, that, during, exhalation, pull, the, ribcage, down, decreasing, the, volume, of, the, thoracic, cavity, the, frc, is, now, decreased, but, since, the, lungs, cannot, be, emptied, completely, there, is, still, about, a, litre, of, residual, air, left, lung, function, testing, is, carried, out, to, evaluate, lung, volumes, and, capacities, the, lungs, possess, several, characteristics, which, protect, against, infection, the, respiratory, tract, is, lined, by, respiratory, epithelium, or, respiratory, mucosa, with, hair, like, projections, called, cilia, that, beat, rhythmically, and, carry, mucus, this, mucociliary, clearance, is, an, important, defence, system, against, air, borne, infection, the, dust, particles, and, bacteria, in, the, inhaled, air, are, caught, in, the, mucosal, surface, of, the, airways, and, are, moved, up, towards, the, pharynx, by, the, rhythmic, upward, beating, action, of, the, cilia, 661, 730, the, lining, of, the, lung, also, secretes, immunoglobulin, a, which, protects, against, respiratory, infections, goblet, cells, secrete, mucus, which, also, contains, several, antimicrobial, compounds, such, as, defensins, antiproteases, and, antioxidants, a, rare, type, of, specialised, cell, called, a, pulmonary, ionocyte, that, is, suggested, may, regulate, mucus, viscosity, has, been, described, in, addition, the, lining, of, the, lung, also, contains, macrophages, immune, cells, which, engulf, and, destroy, debris, and, microbes, that, enter, the, lung, in, a, process, known, as, phagocytosis, and, dendritic, cells, which, present, antigens, to, activate, components, of, the, adaptive, immune, system, such, as, t, cells, and, b, cells, the, size, of, the, respiratory, tract, and, the, flow, of, air, also, protect, the, lungs, from, larger, particles, smaller, particles, deposit, in, the, mouth, and, behind, the, mouth, in, the, oropharynx, and, larger, particles, are, trapped, in, nasal, hair, after, inhalation, in, addition, to, their, function, in, respiration, the, lungs, have, a, number, of, other, functions, they, are, involved, in, maintaining, homeostasis, helping, in, the, regulation, of, blood, pressure, as, part, of, the, renin, angiotensin, system, the, inner, lining, of, the, blood, vessels, secretes, angiotensin, converting, enzyme, ace, an, enzyme, that, catalyses, the, conversion, of, angiotensin, i, to, angiotensin, ii, the, lungs, are, involved, in, the, blood, s, acid, base, homeostasis, by, expelling, carbon, dioxide, when, breathing, the, lungs, also, serve, a, protective, role, several, blood, borne, substances, such, as, a, few, types, of, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin, and, bradykinin, are, excreted, through, the, lungs, drugs, and, other, substances, can, be, absorbed, modified, or, excreted, in, the, lungs, the, lungs, filter, out, small, blood, clots, from, veins, and, prevent, them, from, entering, arteries, and, causing, strokes, the, lungs, also, play, a, pivotal, role, in, speech, by, providing, air, and, airflow, for, the, creation, of, vocal, sounds, and, other, paralanguage, communications, such, as, sighs, and, gasps, research, suggests, a, role, of, the, lungs, in, the, production, of, blood, platelets, about, 20, 000, protein, coding, genes, are, expressed, in, human, cells, and, almost, 75, of, these, genes, are, expressed, in, the, normal, lung, a, little, less, than, 200, of, these, genes, are, more, specifically, expressed, in, the, lung, with, less, than, 20, genes, being, highly, lung, specific, the, highest, expression, of, lung, specific, proteins, are, different, surfactant, proteins, such, as, sftpa1, sftpb, and, sftpc, and, napsin, expressed, in, type, ii, pneumocytes, other, proteins, with, elevated, expression, in, the, lung, are, the, dynein, protein, dnah5, in, ciliated, cells, and, the, secreted, scgb1a1, protein, in, mucus, secreting, goblet, cells, of, the, airway, mucosa, lungs, can, be, affected, by, a, number, of, diseases, and, disorders, pulmonology, is, the, medical, speciality, that, deals, with, respiratory, diseases, involving, the, lungs, and, respiratory, system, cardiothoracic, surgery, deals, with, surgery, of, the, lungs, including, lung, volume, reduction, surgery, lobectomy, pneumectomy, and, lung, transplantation, inflammatory, conditions, of, the, lung, tissue, are, pneumonia, of, the, respiratory, tract, are, bronchitis, and, bronchiolitis, and, of, the, pleurae, surrounding, the, lungs, pleurisy, inflammation, is, usually, caused, by, infections, due, to, bacteria, or, viruses, when, the, lung, tissue, is, inflamed, due, to, other, causes, it, is, called, pneumonitis, one, major, cause, of, bacterial, pneumonia, is, tuberculosis, chronic, infections, often, occur, in, those, with, immunodeficiency, and, can, include, a, fungal, infection, by, aspergillus, fumigatus, that, can, lead, to, an, aspergilloma, forming, in, the, lung, in, the, us, certain, species, of, rat, can, transmit, a, hantavirus, to, humans, that, can, cause, untreatable, hantavirus, pulmonary, syndrome, with, a, similar, presentation, to, that, of, acute, respiratory, distress, syndrome, ards, alcohol, affects, the, lungs, and, can, cause, inflammatory, alcoholic, lung, disease, acute, exposure, to, alcohol, stimulates, the, beating, of, cilia, in, the, respiratory, epithelium, however, chronic, exposure, has, the, effect, of, desensitising, the, ciliary, response, which, reduces, mucociliary, clearance, mcc, mcc, is, an, innate, defense, system, protecting, against, pollutants, and, pathogens, and, when, this, is, disrupted, the, numbers, of, alveolar, macrophages, are, decreased, a, subsequent, inflammatory, response, is, the, release, of, cytokines, another, consequence, is, the, susceptibility, to, infection, a, pulmonary, embolism, is, a, blood, clot, that, becomes, lodged, in, the, pulmonary, arteries, the, majority, of, emboli, arise, because, of, deep, vein, thrombosis, in, the, legs, pulmonary, emboli, may, be, investigated, using, a, ventilation, perfusion, scan, a, ct, scan, of, the, arteries, of, the, lung, or, blood, tests, such, as, the, d, dimer, pulmonary, hypertension, describes, an, increased, pressure, at, the, beginning, of, the, pulmonary, artery, that, has, a, large, number, of, differing, causes, other, rarer, conditions, may, also, affect, the, blood, supply, of, the, lung, such, as, granulomatosis, with, polyangiitis, which, causes, inflammation, of, the, small, blood, vessels, of, the, lungs, and, kidneys, a, lung, contusion, is, a, bruise, caused, by, chest, trauma, it, results, in, hemorrhage, of, the, alveoli, causing, a, build, up, of, fluid, which, can, impair, breathing, and, this, can, be, either, mild, or, severe, the, function, of, the, lungs, can, also, be, affected, by, compression, from, fluid, in, the, pleural, cavity, pleural, effusion, or, other, substances, such, as, air, pneumothorax, blood, hemothorax, or, rarer, causes, these, may, be, investigated, using, a, chest, x, ray, or, ct, scan, and, may, require, the, insertion, of, a, surgical, drain, until, the, underlying, cause, is, identified, and, treated, asthma, bronchiectasis, and, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, that, includes, chronic, bronchitis, and, emphysema, are, all, obstructive, lung, diseases, characterised, by, airway, obstruction, this, limits, the, amount, of, air, that, is, able, to, enter, alveoli, because, of, constriction, of, the, bronchial, tree, due, to, inflammation, obstructive, lung, diseases, are, often, identified, because, of, symptoms, and, diagnosed, with, pulmonary, function, tests, such, as, spirometry, many, obstructive, lung, diseases, are, managed, by, avoiding, triggers, such, as, dust, mites, or, smoking, with, symptom, control, such, as, bronchodilators, and, with, suppression, of, inflammation, such, as, through, corticosteroids, in, severe, cases, a, common, cause, of, chronic, bronchitis, and, emphysema, is, smoking, and, common, causes, of, bronchiectasis, include, severe, infections, and, cystic, fibrosis, the, definitive, cause, of, asthma, is, not, yet, known, but, it, has, been, linked, to, other, atopic, diseases, the, breakdown, of, alveolar, tissue, often, as, a, result, of, tobacco, smoking, leads, to, emphysema, which, can, become, severe, enough, to, develop, into, copd, elastase, breaks, down, the, elastin, in, the, lung, s, connective, tissue, that, can, also, result, in, emphysema, elastase, is, inhibited, by, the, acute, phase, protein, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, and, when, there, is, a, deficiency, in, this, emphysema, can, develop, with, persistent, stress, from, smoking, the, airway, basal, cells, become, disarranged, and, lose, their, regenerative, ability, needed, to, repair, the, epithelial, barrier, the, disorganised, basal, cells, are, seen, to, be, responsible, for, the, major, airway, changes, that, are, characteristic, of, copd, and, with, continued, stress, can, undergo, a, malignant, transformation, studies, have, shown, that, the, initial, development, of, emphysema, is, centred, on, the, early, changes, in, the, airway, epithelium, of, the, small, airways, basal, cells, become, further, deranged, in, a, smoker, s, transition, to, clinically, defined, copd, some, types, of, chronic, lung, diseases, are, classified, as, restrictive, lung, disease, because, of, a, restriction, in, the, amount, of, lung, tissue, involved, in, respiration, these, include, pulmonary, fibrosis, which, can, occur, when, the, lung, is, inflamed, for, a, long, period, of, time, fibrosis, in, the, lung, replaces, functioning, lung, tissue, with, fibrous, connective, tissue, this, can, be, due, to, a, large, variety, of, occupational, lung, diseases, such, as, coalworker, s, pneumoconiosis, autoimmune, diseases, or, more, rarely, to, a, reaction, to, medication, severe, respiratory, disorders, where, spontaneous, breathing, is, not, enough, to, maintain, life, may, need, the, use, of, mechanical, ventilation, to, ensure, an, adequate, supply, of, air, lung, cancer, can, either, arise, directly, from, lung, tissue, or, as, a, result, of, metastasis, from, another, part, of, the, body, there, are, two, main, types, of, primary, tumour, described, as, either, small, cell, or, non, small, cell, lung, carcinomas, the, major, risk, factor, for, cancer, is, smoking, once, a, cancer, is, identified, it, is, staged, using, scans, such, as, a, ct, scan, and, a, sample, of, tissue, from, a, biopsy, is, taken, cancers, may, be, treated, surgically, by, removing, the, tumour, the, use, of, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or, a, combination, or, with, the, aim, of, symptom, control, lung, cancer, screening, is, being, recommended, in, the, united, states, for, high, risk, populations, congenital, disorders, include, cystic, fibrosis, pulmonary, hypoplasia, an, incomplete, development, of, the, lungs, congenital, diaphragmatic, hernia, and, infant, respiratory, distress, syndrome, caused, by, a, deficiency, in, lung, surfactant, an, azygos, lobe, is, a, congenital, anatomical, variation, which, though, usually, without, effect, can, cause, problems, in, thoracoscopic, procedures, a, pneumothorax, collapsed, lung, is, an, abnormal, collection, of, air, in, the, pleural, space, that, causes, an, uncoupling, of, the, lung, from, the, chest, wall, the, lung, cannot, expand, against, the, air, pressure, inside, the, pleural, space, an, easy, to, understand, example, is, a, traumatic, pneumothorax, where, air, enters, the, pleural, space, from, outside, the, body, as, occurs, with, puncture, to, the, chest, wall, similarly, scuba, divers, ascending, while, holding, their, breath, with, their, lungs, fully, inflated, can, cause, air, sacs, alveoli, to, burst, and, leak, high, pressure, air, into, the, pleural, space, as, part, of, a, physical, examination, in, response, to, respiratory, symptoms, of, shortness, of, breath, and, cough, a, lung, examination, may, be, carried, out, this, exam, includes, palpation, and, auscultation, the, areas, of, the, lungs, that, can, be, listened, to, using, a, stethoscope, are, called, the, lung, fields, and, these, are, the, posterior, lateral, and, anterior, lung, fields, the, posterior, fields, can, be, listened, to, from, the, back, and, include, the, lower, lobes, taking, up, three, quarters, of, the, posterior, fields, the, anterior, fields, taking, up, the, other, quarter, and, the, lateral, fields, under, the, axillae, the, left, axilla, for, the, lingual, the, right, axilla, for, the, middle, right, lobe, the, anterior, fields, can, also, be, auscultated, from, the, front, an, area, known, as, the, triangle, of, auscultation, is, an, area, of, thinner, musculature, on, the, back, which, allows, improved, listening, abnormal, breathing, sounds, heard, during, a, lung, exam, can, indicate, the, presence, of, a, lung, condition, wheezing, for, example, is, commonly, associated, with, asthma, and, copd, lung, function, testing, is, carried, out, by, evaluating, a, person, s, capacity, to, inhale, and, exhale, in, different, circumstances, the, volume, of, air, inhaled, and, exhaled, by, a, person, at, rest, is, the, tidal, volume, normally, 500, 750, ml, the, inspiratory, reserve, volume, and, expiratory, reserve, volume, are, the, additional, amounts, a, person, is, able, to, forcibly, inhale, and, exhale, respectively, the, summed, total, of, forced, inspiration, and, expiration, is, a, person, s, vital, capacity, not, all, air, is, expelled, from, the, lungs, even, after, a, forced, breath, out, the, remainder, of, the, air, is, called, the, residual, volume, together, these, terms, are, referred, to, as, lung, volumes, pulmonary, plethysmographs, are, used, to, measure, functional, residual, capacity, functional, residual, capacity, cannot, be, measured, by, tests, that, rely, on, breathing, out, as, a, person, is, only, able, to, breathe, a, maximum, of, 80, of, their, total, functional, capacity, the, total, lung, capacity, depends, on, the, person, s, age, height, weight, and, sex, and, normally, ranges, between, 4, and, 6, litres, females, tend, to, have, a, 20, 25, lower, capacity, than, males, tall, people, tend, to, have, a, larger, total, lung, capacity, than, shorter, people, smokers, have, a, lower, capacity, than, nonsmokers, thinner, persons, tend, to, have, a, larger, capacity, lung, capacity, can, be, increased, by, physical, training, as, much, as, 40, but, the, effect, may, be, modified, by, exposure, to, air, pollution, other, lung, function, tests, include, spirometry, measuring, the, amount, volume, and, flow, of, air, that, can, be, inhaled, and, exhaled, the, maximum, volume, of, breath, that, can, be, exhaled, is, called, the, vital, capacity, in, particular, how, much, a, person, is, able, to, exhale, in, one, second, called, forced, expiratory, volume, fev1, as, a, proportion, of, how, much, they, are, able, to, exhale, in, total, fev, this, ratio, the, fev1, fev, ratio, is, important, to, distinguish, whether, a, lung, disease, is, restrictive, or, obstructive, another, test, is, that, of, the, lung, s, diffusing, capacity, this, is, a, measure, of, the, transfer, of, gas, from, air, to, the, blood, in, the, lung, capillaries, mammal, lung, is, one, of, the, main, types, of, offal, or, pluck, alongside, the, heart, and, trachea, and, is, consumed, as, a, foodstuff, around, the, world, in, dishes, such, as, scottish, haggis, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, legally, prohibits, the, sale, of, animal, lungs, due, to, concerns, such, as, fungal, spores, or, cross, contamination, with, other, organs, although, this, has, been, criticised, as, unfounded, the, lungs, of, birds, are, relatively, small, but, are, connected, to, 8, or, 9, air, sacs, that, extend, through, much, of, the, body, and, are, in, turn, connected, to, air, spaces, within, the, bones, on, inhalation, air, travels, through, the, trachea, of, a, bird, into, the, air, sacs, air, then, travels, continuously, from, the, air, sacs, at, the, back, through, the, lungs, which, are, relatively, fixed, in, size, to, the, air, sacs, at, the, front, from, here, the, air, is, exhaled, these, fixed, size, lungs, are, called, circulatory, lungs, as, distinct, from, the, bellows, type, lungs, found, in, most, other, animals, the, lungs, of, birds, contain, millions, of, tiny, parallel, passages, called, parabronchi, small, sacs, called, atria, radiate, from, the, walls, of, the, tiny, passages, these, like, the, alveoli, in, other, lungs, are, the, site, of, gas, exchange, by, simple, diffusion, the, blood, flow, around, the, parabronchi, and, their, atria, forms, a, cross, current, process, of, gas, exchange, see, diagram, on, the, right, the, air, sacs, which, hold, air, do, not, contribute, much, to, gas, exchange, despite, being, thin, walled, as, they, are, poorly, vascularised, the, air, sacs, expand, and, contract, due, to, changes, in, the, volume, in, the, thorax, and, abdomen, this, volume, change, is, caused, by, the, movement, of, the, sternum, and, ribs, and, this, movement, is, often, synchronised, with, movement, of, the, flight, muscles, parabronchi, in, which, the, air, flow, is, unidirectional, are, called, paleopulmonic, parabronchi, and, are, found, in, all, birds, some, birds, however, have, in, addition, a, lung, structure, where, the, air, flow, in, the, parabronchi, is, bidirectional, these, are, termed, neopulmonic, parabronchi, the, lungs, of, most, reptiles, have, a, single, bronchus, running, down, the, centre, from, which, numerous, branches, reach, out, to, individual, pockets, throughout, the, lungs, these, pockets, are, similar, to, alveoli, in, mammals, but, much, larger, and, fewer, in, number, these, give, the, lung, a, sponge, like, texture, in, tuataras, snakes, and, some, lizards, the, lungs, are, simpler, in, structure, similar, to, that, of, typical, amphibians, snakes, and, limbless, lizards, typically, possess, only, the, right, lung, as, a, major, respiratory, organ, the, left, lung, is, greatly, reduced, or, even, absent, amphisbaenians, however, have, the, opposite, arrangement, with, a, major, left, lung, and, a, reduced, or, absent, right, lung, both, crocodilians, and, monitor, lizards, have, lungs, similar, to, those, of, birds, providing, a, unidirectional, airflow, and, even, possessing, air, sacs, the, now, extinct, pterosaurs, have, seemingly, even, further, refined, this, type, of, lung, extending, the, airsacs, into, the, wing, membranes, and, in, the, case, of, lonchodectids, tupuxuara, and, azhdarchoids, the, hindlimbs, reptilian, lungs, typically, receive, air, via, expansion, and, contraction, of, the, ribs, driven, by, axial, muscles, and, buccal, pumping, crocodilians, also, rely, on, the, hepatic, piston, method, in, which, the, liver, is, pulled, back, by, a, muscle, anchored, to, the, pubic, bone, part, of, the, pelvis, called, the, diaphragmaticus, which, in, turn, creates, negative, pressure, in, the, crocodile, s, thoracic, cavity, allowing, air, to, be, moved, into, the, lungs, by, boyle, s, law, turtles, which, are, unable, to, move, their, ribs, instead, use, their, forelimbs, and, pectoral, girdle, to, force, air, in, and, out, of, the, lungs, the, lungs, of, most, frogs, and, other, amphibians, are, simple, and, balloon, like, with, gas, exchange, limited, to, the, outer, surface, of, the, lung, this, is, not, very, efficient, but, amphibians, have, low, metabolic, demands, and, can, also, quickly, dispose, of, carbon, dioxide, by, diffusion, across, their, skin, in, water, and, supplement, their, oxygen, supply, by, the, same, method, amphibians, employ, a, positive, pressure, system, to, get, air, to, their, lungs, forcing, air, down, into, the, lungs, by, buccal, pumping, this, is, distinct, from, most, higher, vertebrates, who, use, a, breathing, system, driven, by, negative, pressure, where, the, lungs, are, inflated, by, expanding, the, rib, cage, in, buccal, pumping, the, floor, of, the, mouth, is, lowered, filling, the, mouth, cavity, with, air, the, throat, muscles, then, presses, the, throat, against, the, underside, of, the, skull, forcing, the, air, into, the, lungs, due, to, the, possibility, of, respiration, across, the, skin, combined, with, small, size, all, known, lungless, tetrapods, are, amphibians, the, majority, of, salamander, species, are, lungless, salamanders, which, respirate, through, their, skin, and, tissues, lining, their, mouth, this, necessarily, restricts, their, size, all, are, small, and, rather, thread, like, in, appearance, maximising, skin, surface, relative, to, body, volume, other, known, lungless, tetrapods, are, the, bornean, flat, headed, frog, and, atretochoana, eiselti, a, caecilian, the, lungs, of, amphibians, typically, have, a, few, narrow, internal, walls, septa, of, soft, tissue, around, the, outer, walls, increasing, the, respiratory, surface, area, and, giving, the, lung, a, honeycomb, appearance, in, some, salamanders, even, these, are, lacking, and, the, lung, has, a, smooth, wall, in, caecilians, as, in, snakes, only, the, right, lung, attains, any, size, or, development, lungs, are, found, in, three, groups, of, fish, the, coelacanths, the, bichirs, and, the, lungfish, like, in, tetrapods, but, unlike, fish, with, swim, bladder, the, opening, is, at, the, ventral, side, of, the, esophagus, the, coelacanth, has, a, nonfunctional, and, unpaired, vestigial, lung, surrounded, by, a, fatty, organ, bichirs, the, only, group, of, ray, finned, fish, with, lungs, have, a, pair, which, are, hollow, unchambered, sacs, where, the, gas, exchange, occurs, on, very, flat, folds, that, increase, their, inner, surface, area, the, lungs, of, lungfish, show, more, resemblance, to, tetrapod, lungs, there, is, an, elaborate, network, of, parenchymal, septa, dividing, them, into, numerous, respiration, chambers, in, the, australian, lungfish, there, is, only, a, single, lung, albeit, divided, into, two, lobes, other, lungfish, however, have, traditionally, been, considered, having, two, lungs, but, newer, research, defines, paired, lungs, as, bilateral, lung, buds, that, arise, simultaneously, and, are, both, connected, directly, to, the, foregut, which, is, only, seen, in, tetrapods, in, all, lungfish, including, the, australian, the, lungs, are, located, in, the, upper, dorsal, part, of, the, body, with, the, connecting, duct, curving, around, and, above, the, esophagus, the, blood, supply, also, twists, around, the, esophagus, suggesting, that, the, lungs, originally, evolved, in, the, ventral, part, of, the, body, as, in, other, vertebrates, a, number, of, invertebrates, have, lung, like, structures, that, serve, a, similar, respiratory, purpose, to, true, vertebrate, lungs, but, are, not, evolutionarily, related, and, only, arise, out, of, convergent, evolution, some, arachnids, such, as, spiders, and, scorpions, have, structures, called, book, lungs, used, for, atmospheric, gas, exchange, some, species, of, spider, have, four, pairs, of, book, lungs, but, most, have, two, pairs, scorpions, have, spiracles, on, their, body, for, the, entrance, of, air, to, the, book, lungs, the, coconut, crab, is, terrestrial, and, uses, structures, called, branchiostegal, lungs, to, breathe, air, juveniles, are, released, into, the, ocean, however, adults, cannot, swim, and, possess, an, only, rudimentary, set, of, gills, the, adult, crabs, can, breathe, on, land, and, hold, their, breath, underwater, the, branchiostegal, lungs, are, seen, as, a, developmental, adaptive, stage, from, water, living, to, enable, land, living, or, from, fish, to, amphibian, pulmonates, are, mostly, land, snails, and, slugs, that, have, developed, a, simple, lung, from, the, mantle, cavity, an, externally, located, opening, called, the, pneumostome, allows, air, to, be, taken, into, the, mantle, cavity, lung, the, lungs, of, today, s, terrestrial, vertebrates, and, the, gas, bladders, of, today, s, fish, are, believed, to, have, evolved, from, simple, sacs, as, outpocketings, of, the, esophagus, that, allowed, early, fish, to, gulp, air, under, oxygen, poor, conditions, these, outpocketings, first, arose, in, the, bony, fish, in, most, of, the, ray, finned, fish, the, sacs, evolved, into, closed, off, gas, bladders, while, a, number, of, carp, trout, herring, catfish, and, eels, have, retained, the, physostome, condition, with, the, sac, being, open, to, the, esophagus, in, more, basal, bony, fish, such, as, the, gar, bichir, bowfin, and, the, lobe, finned, fish, the, bladders, have, evolved, to, primarily, function, as, lungs, the, lobe, finned, fish, gave, rise, to, the, land, based, tetrapods, thus, the, lungs, of, vertebrates, are, homologous, to, the, gas, bladders, of, fish, but, not, to, their, gills
