a, disease, is, a, particular, abnormal, condition, that, adversely, affects, the, structure, or, function, of, all, or, part, of, an, organism, and, is, not, immediately, due, to, any, external, injury, diseases, are, often, known, to, be, medical, conditions, that, are, associated, with, specific, signs, and, symptoms, a, disease, may, be, caused, by, external, factors, such, as, pathogens, or, by, internal, dysfunctions, for, example, internal, dysfunctions, of, the, immune, system, can, produce, a, variety, of, different, diseases, including, various, forms, of, immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies, and, autoimmune, disorders, in, humans, disease, is, often, used, more, broadly, to, refer, to, any, condition, that, causes, pain, dysfunction, distress, social, problems, or, death, to, the, person, affected, or, similar, problems, for, those, in, contact, with, the, person, in, this, broader, sense, it, sometimes, includes, injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated, symptoms, deviant, behaviors, and, atypical, variations, of, structure, and, function, while, in, other, contexts, and, for, other, purposes, these, may, be, considered, distinguishable, categories, diseases, can, affect, people, not, only, physically, but, also, mentally, as, contracting, and, living, with, a, disease, can, alter, the, affected, person, s, perspective, on, life, death, due, to, disease, is, called, death, by, natural, causes, there, are, four, main, types, of, disease, infectious, diseases, deficiency, diseases, hereditary, diseases, including, both, genetic, and, non, genetic, hereditary, diseases, and, physiological, diseases, diseases, can, also, be, classified, in, other, ways, such, as, communicable, versus, non, communicable, diseases, the, deadliest, diseases, in, humans, are, coronary, artery, disease, blood, flow, obstruction, followed, by, cerebrovascular, disease, and, lower, respiratory, infections, in, developed, countries, the, diseases, that, cause, the, most, sickness, overall, are, neuropsychiatric, conditions, such, as, depression, and, anxiety, the, study, of, disease, is, called, pathology, which, includes, the, study, of, etiology, or, cause, in, many, cases, terms, such, as, disease, disorder, morbidity, sickness, and, illness, are, used, interchangeably, however, there, are, situations, when, specific, terms, are, considered, preferable, in, an, infectious, disease, the, incubation, period, is, the, time, between, infection, and, the, appearance, of, symptoms, the, latency, period, is, the, time, between, infection, and, the, ability, of, the, disease, to, spread, to, another, person, which, may, precede, follow, or, be, simultaneous, with, the, appearance, of, symptoms, some, viruses, also, exhibit, a, dormant, phase, called, viral, latency, in, which, the, virus, hides, in, the, body, in, an, inactive, state, for, example, varicella, zoster, virus, causes, chickenpox, in, the, acute, phase, after, recovery, from, chickenpox, the, virus, may, remain, dormant, in, nerve, cells, for, many, years, and, later, cause, herpes, zoster, shingles, diseases, may, be, classified, by, cause, pathogenesis, mechanism, by, which, the, disease, is, caused, or, by, symptoms, alternatively, diseases, may, be, classified, according, to, the, organ, system, involved, though, this, is, often, complicated, since, many, diseases, affect, more, than, one, organ, a, chief, difficulty, in, nosology, is, that, diseases, often, cannot, be, defined, and, classified, clearly, especially, when, cause, or, pathogenesis, are, unknown, thus, diagnostic, terms, often, only, reflect, a, symptom, or, set, of, symptoms, syndrome, classical, classification, of, human, disease, derives, from, the, observational, correlation, between, pathological, analysis, and, clinical, syndromes, today, it, is, preferred, to, classify, them, by, their, cause, if, it, is, known, the, most, known, and, used, classification, of, diseases, is, the, world, health, organization, s, icd, this, is, periodically, updated, currently, the, last, publication, is, the, icd, 11, diseases, can, be, caused, by, any, number, of, factors, and, may, be, acquired, or, congenital, microorganisms, genetics, the, environment, or, a, combination, of, these, can, contribute, to, a, diseased, state, only, some, diseases, such, as, influenza, are, contagious, and, commonly, believed, infectious, the, microorganisms, that, cause, these, diseases, are, known, as, pathogens, and, include, varieties, of, bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and, fungi, infectious, diseases, can, be, transmitted, e, g, by, hand, to, mouth, contact, with, infectious, material, on, surfaces, by, bites, of, insects, or, other, carriers, of, the, disease, and, from, contaminated, water, or, food, often, via, fecal, contamination, etc, also, there, are, sexually, transmitted, diseases, in, some, cases, microorganisms, that, are, not, readily, spread, from, person, to, person, play, a, role, while, other, diseases, can, be, prevented, or, ameliorated, with, appropriate, nutrition, or, other, lifestyle, changes, some, diseases, such, as, most, but, not, all, forms, of, cancer, heart, disease, and, mental, disorders, are, non, infectious, diseases, many, non, infectious, diseases, have, a, partly, or, completely, genetic, basis, see, genetic, disorder, and, may, thus, be, transmitted, from, one, generation, to, another, social, determinants, of, health, are, the, social, conditions, in, which, people, live, that, determine, their, health, illnesses, are, generally, related, to, social, economic, political, and, environmental, circumstances, social, determinants, of, health, have, been, recognized, by, several, health, organizations, such, as, the, public, health, agency, of, canada, and, the, world, health, organization, to, greatly, influence, collective, and, personal, well, being, the, world, health, organization, s, social, determinants, council, also, recognizes, social, determinants, of, health, in, poverty, when, the, cause, of, a, disease, is, poorly, understood, societies, tend, to, mythologize, the, disease, or, use, it, as, a, metaphor, or, symbol, of, whatever, that, culture, considers, evil, for, example, until, the, bacterial, cause, of, tuberculosis, was, discovered, in, 1882, experts, variously, ascribed, the, disease, to, heredity, a, sedentary, lifestyle, depressed, mood, and, overindulgence, in, sex, rich, food, or, alcohol, all, of, which, were, social, ills, at, the, time, when, a, disease, is, caused, by, a, pathogenic, organism, e, g, when, malaria, is, caused, by, plasmodium, one, should, not, confuse, the, pathogen, the, cause, of, the, disease, with, disease, itself, for, example, west, nile, virus, the, pathogen, causes, west, nile, fever, the, disease, the, misuse, of, basic, definitions, in, epidemiology, is, frequent, in, scientific, publications, many, diseases, and, disorders, can, be, prevented, through, a, variety, of, means, these, include, sanitation, proper, nutrition, adequate, exercise, vaccinations, and, other, self, care, and, public, health, measures, such, as, obligatory, face, mask, mandates, medical, therapies, or, treatments, are, efforts, to, cure, or, improve, a, disease, or, other, health, problems, in, the, medical, field, therapy, is, synonymous, with, the, word, treatment, among, psychologists, the, term, may, refer, specifically, to, psychotherapy, or, talk, therapy, common, treatments, include, medications, surgery, medical, devices, and, self, care, treatments, may, be, provided, by, an, organized, health, care, system, or, informally, by, the, patient, or, family, members, preventive, healthcare, is, a, way, to, avoid, an, injury, sickness, or, disease, in, the, first, place, a, treatment, or, cure, is, applied, after, a, medical, problem, has, already, started, a, treatment, attempts, to, improve, or, remove, a, problem, but, treatments, may, not, produce, permanent, cures, especially, in, chronic, diseases, cures, are, a, subset, of, treatments, that, reverse, diseases, completely, or, end, medical, problems, permanently, many, diseases, that, cannot, be, completely, cured, are, still, treatable, pain, management, also, called, pain, medicine, is, that, branch, of, medicine, employing, an, interdisciplinary, approach, to, the, relief, of, pain, and, improvement, in, the, quality, of, life, of, those, living, with, pain, treatment, for, medical, emergencies, must, be, provided, promptly, often, through, an, emergency, department, or, in, less, critical, situations, through, an, urgent, care, facility, epidemiology, is, the, study, of, the, factors, that, cause, or, encourage, diseases, some, diseases, are, more, common, in, certain, geographic, areas, among, people, with, certain, genetic, or, socioeconomic, characteristics, or, at, different, times, of, the, year, epidemiology, is, considered, a, cornerstone, methodology, of, public, health, research, and, is, highly, regarded, in, evidence, based, medicine, for, identifying, risk, factors, for, diseases, in, the, study, of, communicable, and, non, communicable, diseases, the, work, of, epidemiologists, ranges, from, outbreak, investigation, to, study, design, data, collection, and, analysis, including, the, development, of, statistical, models, to, test, hypotheses, and, the, documentation, of, results, for, submission, to, peer, reviewed, journals, epidemiologists, also, study, the, interaction, of, diseases, in, a, population, a, condition, known, as, a, syndemic, epidemiologists, rely, on, a, number, of, other, scientific, disciplines, such, as, biology, to, better, understand, disease, processes, biostatistics, the, current, raw, information, available, geographic, information, science, to, store, data, and, map, disease, patterns, and, social, science, disciplines, to, better, understand, proximate, and, distal, risk, factors, epidemiology, can, help, identify, causes, as, well, as, guide, prevention, efforts, in, studying, diseases, epidemiology, faces, the, challenge, of, defining, them, especially, for, poorly, understood, diseases, different, groups, might, use, significantly, different, definitions, without, an, agreed, on, definition, different, researchers, may, report, different, numbers, of, cases, and, characteristics, of, the, disease, some, morbidity, databases, are, compiled, with, data, supplied, by, states, and, territories, health, authorities, at, national, levels, or, larger, scale, such, as, european, hospital, morbidity, database, hmdb, which, may, contain, hospital, discharge, data, by, detailed, diagnosis, age, and, sex, the, european, hmdb, data, was, submitted, by, european, countries, to, the, world, health, organization, regional, office, for, europe, disease, burden, is, the, impact, of, a, health, problem, in, an, area, measured, by, financial, cost, mortality, morbidity, or, other, indicators, there, are, several, measures, used, to, quantify, the, burden, imposed, by, diseases, on, people, the, years, of, potential, life, lost, ypll, is, a, simple, estimate, of, the, number, of, years, that, a, person, s, life, was, shortened, due, to, a, disease, for, example, if, a, person, dies, at, the, age, of, 65, from, a, disease, and, would, probably, have, lived, until, age, 80, without, that, disease, then, that, disease, has, caused, a, loss, of, 15, years, of, potential, life, ypll, measurements, do, not, account, for, how, disabled, a, person, is, before, dying, so, the, measurement, treats, a, person, who, dies, suddenly, and, a, person, who, died, at, the, same, age, after, decades, of, illness, as, equivalent, in, 2004, the, world, health, organization, calculated, that, 932, million, years, of, potential, life, were, lost, to, premature, death, the, quality, adjusted, life, year, qaly, and, disability, adjusted, life, year, daly, metrics, are, similar, but, take, into, account, whether, the, person, was, healthy, after, diagnosis, in, addition, to, the, number, of, years, lost, due, to, premature, death, these, measurements, add, part, of, the, years, lost, to, being, sick, unlike, ypll, these, measurements, show, the, burden, imposed, on, people, who, are, very, sick, but, who, live, a, normal, lifespan, a, disease, that, has, high, morbidity, but, low, mortality, has, a, high, daly, and, a, low, ypll, in, 2004, the, world, health, organization, calculated, that, 1, 5, billion, disability, adjusted, life, years, were, lost, to, disease, and, injury, in, the, developed, world, heart, disease, and, stroke, cause, the, most, loss, of, life, but, neuropsychiatric, conditions, like, major, depressive, disorder, cause, the, most, years, lost, to, being, sick, how, a, society, responds, to, diseases, is, the, subject, of, medical, sociology, a, condition, may, be, considered, a, disease, in, some, cultures, or, eras, but, not, in, others, for, example, obesity, can, represent, wealth, and, abundance, and, is, a, status, symbol, in, famine, prone, areas, and, some, places, hard, hit, by, hiv, aids, epilepsy, is, considered, a, sign, of, spiritual, gifts, among, the, hmong, people, sickness, confers, the, social, legitimization, of, certain, benefits, such, as, illness, benefits, work, avoidance, and, being, looked, after, by, others, the, person, who, is, sick, takes, on, a, social, role, called, the, sick, role, a, person, who, responds, to, a, dreaded, disease, such, as, cancer, in, a, culturally, acceptable, fashion, may, be, publicly, and, privately, honored, with, higher, social, status, in, return, for, these, benefits, the, sick, person, is, obligated, to, seek, treatment, and, work, to, become, well, once, more, as, a, comparison, consider, pregnancy, which, is, not, interpreted, as, a, disease, or, sickness, even, if, the, mother, and, baby, may, both, benefit, from, medical, care, most, religions, grant, exceptions, from, religious, duties, to, people, who, are, sick, for, example, one, whose, life, would, be, endangered, by, fasting, on, yom, kippur, or, during, the, month, of, ramadan, is, exempted, from, the, requirement, or, even, forbidden, from, participating, people, who, are, sick, are, also, exempted, from, social, duties, for, example, ill, health, is, the, only, socially, acceptable, reason, for, an, american, to, refuse, an, invitation, to, the, white, house, the, identification, of, a, condition, as, a, disease, rather, than, as, simply, a, variation, of, human, structure, or, function, can, have, significant, social, or, economic, implications, the, controversial, recognition, of, diseases, such, as, repetitive, stress, injury, rsi, and, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, has, had, a, number, of, positive, and, negative, effects, on, the, financial, and, other, responsibilities, of, governments, corporations, and, institutions, towards, individuals, as, well, as, on, the, individuals, themselves, the, social, implication, of, viewing, aging, as, a, disease, could, be, profound, though, this, classification, is, not, yet, widespread, lepers, were, people, who, were, historically, shunned, because, they, had, an, infectious, disease, and, the, term, leper, still, evokes, social, stigma, fear, of, disease, can, still, be, a, widespread, social, phenomenon, though, not, all, diseases, evoke, extreme, social, stigma, social, standing, and, economic, status, affect, health, diseases, of, poverty, are, diseases, that, are, associated, with, poverty, and, low, social, status, diseases, of, affluence, are, diseases, that, are, associated, with, high, social, and, economic, status, which, diseases, are, associated, with, which, states, vary, according, to, time, place, and, technology, some, diseases, such, as, diabetes, mellitus, may, be, associated, with, both, poverty, poor, food, choices, and, affluence, long, lifespans, and, sedentary, lifestyles, through, different, mechanisms, the, term, lifestyle, diseases, describes, diseases, associated, with, longevity, and, that, are, more, common, among, older, people, for, example, cancer, is, far, more, common, in, societies, in, which, most, members, live, until, they, reach, the, age, of, 80, than, in, societies, in, which, most, members, die, before, they, reach, the, age, of, 50, an, illness, narrative, is, a, way, of, organizing, a, medical, experience, into, a, coherent, story, that, illustrates, the, sick, individual, s, personal, experience, people, use, metaphors, to, make, sense, of, their, experiences, with, disease, the, metaphors, move, disease, from, an, objective, thing, that, exists, to, an, affective, experience, the, most, popular, metaphors, draw, on, military, concepts, disease, is, an, enemy, that, must, be, feared, fought, battled, and, routed, the, patient, or, the, healthcare, provider, is, a, warrior, rather, than, a, passive, victim, or, bystander, the, agents, of, communicable, diseases, are, invaders, non, communicable, diseases, constitute, internal, insurrection, or, civil, war, because, the, threat, is, urgent, perhaps, a, matter, of, life, and, death, unthinkably, radical, even, oppressive, measures, are, society, s, and, the, patient, s, moral, duty, as, they, courageously, mobilize, to, struggle, against, destruction, the, war, on, cancer, is, an, example, of, this, metaphorical, use, of, language, this, language, is, empowering, to, some, patients, but, leaves, others, feeling, like, they, are, failures, another, class, of, metaphors, describes, the, experience, of, illness, as, a, journey, the, person, travels, to, or, from, a, place, of, disease, and, changes, himself, discovers, new, information, or, increases, his, experience, along, the, way, he, may, travel, on, the, road, to, recovery, or, make, changes, to, get, on, the, right, track, or, choose, pathways, some, are, explicitly, immigration, themed, the, patient, has, been, exiled, from, the, home, territory, of, health, to, the, land, of, the, ill, changing, identity, and, relationships, in, the, process, this, language, is, more, common, among, british, healthcare, professionals, than, the, language, of, physical, aggression, some, metaphors, are, disease, specific, slavery, is, a, common, metaphor, for, addictions, the, alcoholic, is, enslaved, by, drink, and, the, smoker, is, captive, to, nicotine, some, cancer, patients, treat, the, loss, of, their, hair, from, chemotherapy, as, a, metonymy, or, metaphor, for, all, the, losses, caused, by, the, disease, some, diseases, are, used, as, metaphors, for, social, ills, cancer, is, a, common, description, for, anything, that, is, endemic, and, destructive, in, society, such, as, poverty, injustice, or, racism, aids, was, seen, as, a, divine, judgment, for, moral, decadence, and, only, by, purging, itself, from, the, pollution, of, the, invader, could, society, become, healthy, again, more, recently, when, aids, seemed, less, threatening, this, type, of, emotive, language, was, applied, to, avian, flu, and, type, 2, diabetes, mellitus, authors, in, the, 19th, century, commonly, used, tuberculosis, as, a, symbol, and, a, metaphor, for, transcendence, people, with, the, disease, were, portrayed, in, literature, as, having, risen, above, daily, life, to, become, ephemeral, objects, of, spiritual, or, artistic, achievement, in, the, 20th, century, after, its, cause, was, better, understood, the, same, disease, became, the, emblem, of, poverty, squalor, and, other, social, problems, signs, and, symptoms, syndrome, disease, medical, diagnosis, differential, diagnosis, prognosis, acute, chronic, cure, eponymous, disease, acronym, or, abbreviation,
