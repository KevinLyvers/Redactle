a, sexually, transmitted, infection, sti, also, referred, to, as, a, sexually, transmitted, disease, std, and, the, older, term, venereal, disease, vd, is, an, infection, that, is, spread, by, sexual, activity, especially, vaginal, intercourse, anal, sex, oral, sex, or, sometimes, manual, sex, stis, often, do, not, initially, cause, symptoms, which, results, in, a, risk, of, transmitting, them, on, to, others, the, term, sexually, transmitted, infection, is, generally, preferred, over, sexually, transmitted, disease, or, venereal, disease, as, it, includes, cases, with, no, symptomatic, disease, symptoms, and, signs, of, stis, may, include, vaginal, discharge, penile, discharge, ulcers, on, or, around, the, genitals, and, pelvic, pain, some, stis, can, cause, infertility, bacterial, stis, include, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and, syphilis, viral, stis, include, genital, warts, genital, herpes, and, hiv, aids, parasitic, stis, include, trichomoniasis, most, stis, are, treatable, and, curable, of, the, most, common, infections, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and, trichomoniasis, are, curable, while, hiv, aids, and, genital, herpes, are, not, curable, some, vaccinations, may, decrease, the, risk, of, certain, infections, including, hepatitis, b, and, few, types, of, hpv, safe, sex, practices, such, as, use, of, condoms, having, smaller, number, of, sexual, partners, and, being, in, a, relationship, in, which, each, person, only, has, sex, with, the, other, also, decreases, stis, risk, comprehensive, sex, education, may, also, be, useful, sti, diagnostic, tests, are, usually, easily, available, in, the, developed, world, but, they, are, often, unavailable, in, the, developing, world, there, is, often, shame, and, stigma, associated, with, stis, in, 2015, stis, other, than, hiv, resulted, in, 108, 000, deaths, worldwide, globally, in, 2015, about, 1, 1, billion, people, had, stis, other, than, hiv, aids, about, 500, million, have, either, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, or, trichomoniasis, at, least, an, additional, 530, million, have, genital, herpes, and, 290, million, women, have, human, papillomavirus, historical, documentation, of, stis, in, antiquity, dates, back, to, at, least, the, ebers, papyrus, c, 1550, bce, and, the, hebrew, bible, old, testament, 8th, 7th, c, bce, not, all, stis, are, symptomatic, and, symptoms, may, not, appear, immediately, after, infection, in, some, instances, a, disease, can, be, carried, with, no, symptoms, which, leaves, a, greater, risk, of, passing, the, disease, on, to, others, depending, on, the, disease, some, untreated, stis, can, lead, to, infertility, chronic, pain, or, death, the, presence, of, an, sti, in, prepubescent, children, may, indicate, sexual, abuse, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, present, in, a, pregnant, woman, may, be, passed, on, to, the, infant, before, or, after, birth, sexually, transmitted, infections, include, twenty, seven, different, viruses, have, been, identified, in, semen, information, on, whether, or, not, transmission, occurs, or, whether, the, viruses, cause, disease, is, uncertain, some, of, these, microbes, are, known, to, be, sexually, transmitted, many, stis, are, more, easily, transmitted, through, the, mucous, membranes, of, the, penis, vulva, rectum, urinary, tract, and, less, often, depending, on, type, of, infection, the, mouth, throat, respiratory, tract, and, eyes, the, visible, membrane, covering, the, head, of, the, penis, is, a, mucous, membrane, though, it, produces, no, mucus, similar, to, the, lips, of, the, mouth, mucous, membranes, differ, from, skin, in, that, they, allow, certain, pathogens, into, the, body, the, amount, of, contact, with, infective, sources, which, causes, infection, varies, with, each, pathogen, but, in, all, cases, a, disease, may, result, from, even, light, contact, from, fluid, carriers, like, venereal, fluids, onto, a, mucous, membrane, some, stis, such, as, hiv, can, be, transmitted, from, mother, to, child, either, during, pregnancy, or, breastfeeding, healthcare, professionals, suggest, safer, sex, such, as, the, use, of, condoms, as, a, reliable, way, of, decreasing, the, risk, of, contracting, sexually, transmitted, infections, during, sexual, activity, but, safer, sex, cannot, be, considered, to, provide, complete, protection, from, an, sti, the, transfer, of, and, exposure, to, bodily, fluids, such, as, blood, transfusions, and, other, blood, products, sharing, injection, needles, needle, stick, injuries, when, medical, staff, are, inadvertently, jabbed, or, pricked, with, needles, during, medical, procedures, sharing, tattoo, needles, and, childbirth, are, other, avenues, of, transmission, these, different, means, put, certain, groups, such, as, medical, workers, and, haemophiliacs, and, drug, users, particularly, at, risk, it, is, possible, to, be, an, asymptomatic, carrier, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, in, particular, sexually, transmitted, infections, in, women, often, cause, the, serious, condition, of, pelvic, inflammatory, disease, testing, may, be, for, a, single, infection, or, consist, of, a, number, of, tests, for, a, range, of, stis, including, tests, for, syphilis, trichomonas, gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes, hepatitis, and, hiv, no, procedure, tests, for, all, infectious, agents, sti, tests, may, be, used, for, a, number, of, reasons, early, identification, and, treatment, results, in, less, chance, to, spread, disease, and, for, some, conditions, may, improve, the, outcomes, of, treatment, there, is, often, a, window, period, after, initial, infection, during, which, an, sti, test, will, be, negative, during, this, period, the, infection, may, be, transmissible, the, duration, of, this, period, varies, depending, on, the, infection, and, the, test, diagnosis, may, also, be, delayed, by, reluctance, of, the, infected, person, to, seek, a, medical, professional, one, report, indicated, that, people, turn, to, the, internet, rather, than, to, a, medical, professional, for, information, on, stis, to, a, higher, degree, than, for, other, sexual, problems, until, the, 1990s, stis, were, commonly, known, as, venereal, diseases, an, antiquated, euphemism, derived, from, the, latin, venereus, being, the, adjectival, form, of, venus, the, roman, goddess, of, love, however, in, the, post, classical, education, era, the, euphemistic, effect, was, entirely, lost, and, the, common, abbreviation, vd, held, only, negative, connotations, other, former, euphemisms, for, stis, include, blood, diseases, and, social, diseases, the, present, euphemism, is, in, the, use, of, the, initials, sti, rather, than, in, the, words, they, represent, the, world, health, organization, who, has, recommended, the, more, inclusive, term, sexually, transmitted, infection, since, 1999, public, health, officials, originally, introduced, the, term, sexually, transmitted, infection, which, clinicians, are, increasingly, using, alongside, the, term, sexually, transmitted, disease, in, order, to, distinguish, it, from, the, former, strategies, for, reducing, sti, risk, include, vaccination, mutual, monogamy, reducing, the, number, of, sexual, partners, and, abstinence, also, potentially, helpful, is, behavioral, counseling, for, sexually, active, adolescents, and, for, adults, who, are, at, increased, risk, such, interactive, counseling, which, can, be, resource, intensive, is, directed, at, a, person, s, risk, the, situations, in, which, risk, occurs, and, the, use, of, personalized, goal, setting, strategies, the, most, effective, way, to, prevent, sexual, transmission, of, stis, is, to, avoid, contact, of, body, parts, or, fluids, which, can, lead, to, transfer, with, an, infected, partner, not, all, sexual, activities, involve, contact, cybersex, phone, sex, or, masturbation, from, a, distance, are, methods, of, avoiding, contact, proper, use, of, condoms, reduces, contact, and, risk, although, a, condom, is, effective, in, limiting, exposure, some, disease, transmission, may, occur, even, with, a, condom, both, partners, can, get, tested, for, stis, before, initiating, sexual, contact, or, before, resuming, contact, if, a, partner, engaged, in, contact, with, someone, else, many, infections, are, not, detectable, immediately, after, exposure, so, enough, time, must, be, allowed, between, possible, exposures, and, testing, for, the, tests, to, be, accurate, certain, stis, particularly, certain, persistent, viruses, like, hpv, may, be, impossible, to, detect, some, treatment, facilities, use, in, home, test, kits, and, have, the, person, return, the, test, for, follow, up, other, facilities, strongly, encourage, that, those, previously, infected, return, to, ensure, that, the, infection, has, been, eliminated, novel, strategies, to, foster, re, testing, have, been, the, use, of, text, messaging, and, email, as, reminders, these, types, of, reminders, are, now, used, in, addition, to, phone, calls, and, letters, after, obtaining, a, sexual, history, a, healthcare, provider, can, encourage, risk, reduction, by, providing, prevention, counseling, prevention, counseling, is, most, effective, if, provided, in, a, nonjudgmental, and, empathetic, manner, appropriate, to, the, person, s, culture, language, gender, sexual, orientation, age, and, developmental, level, prevention, counseling, for, stis, is, usually, offered, to, all, sexually, active, adolescents, and, to, all, adults, who, have, received, a, diagnosis, have, had, an, sti, in, the, past, year, or, have, multiple, sex, partners, vaccines, are, available, that, protect, against, some, viral, stis, such, as, hepatitis, a, hepatitis, b, and, some, types, of, hpv, vaccination, before, initiation, of, sexual, contact, is, advised, to, assure, maximal, protection, the, development, of, vaccines, to, protect, against, gonorrhea, is, ongoing, condoms, and, female, condoms, only, provide, protection, when, used, properly, as, a, barrier, and, only, to, and, from, the, area, that, they, cover, uncovered, areas, are, still, susceptible, to, many, stis, in, the, case, of, hiv, sexual, transmission, routes, almost, always, involve, the, penis, as, hiv, cannot, spread, through, unbroken, skin, therefore, properly, shielding, the, penis, with, a, properly, worn, condom, from, the, vagina, or, anus, effectively, stops, hiv, transmission, an, infected, fluid, to, broken, skin, borne, direct, transmission, of, hiv, would, not, be, considered, sexually, transmitted, but, can, still, theoretically, occur, during, sexual, contact, this, can, be, avoided, simply, by, not, engaging, in, sexual, contact, when, presenting, open, bleeding, wounds, other, stis, even, viral, infections, can, be, prevented, with, the, use, of, latex, polyurethane, or, polyisoprene, condoms, as, a, barrier, some, microorganisms, and, viruses, are, small, enough, to, pass, through, the, pores, in, natural, skin, condoms, but, are, still, too, large, to, pass, through, latex, or, synthetic, condoms, proper, male, condom, usage, entails, in, order, to, best, protect, oneself, and, the, partner, from, stis, the, old, condom, and, its, contents, are, to, be, treated, as, infectious, and, properly, disposed, of, a, new, condom, is, used, for, each, act, of, intercourse, as, multiple, usages, increase, the, chance, of, breakage, defeating, the, effectiveness, as, a, barrier, in, the, case, of, female, condoms, the, device, consists, of, two, rings, one, in, each, terminal, portion, the, larger, ring, should, fit, snugly, over, the, cervix, and, the, smaller, ring, remains, outside, the, vagina, covering, the, vulva, this, system, provides, some, protection, of, the, external, genitalia, the, cap, was, developed, after, the, cervical, diaphragm, both, cover, the, cervix, and, the, main, difference, between, the, diaphragm, and, the, cap, is, that, the, latter, must, be, used, only, once, using, a, new, one, in, each, sexual, act, the, diaphragm, however, can, be, used, more, than, once, these, two, devices, partially, protect, against, stis, they, do, not, protect, against, hiv, researchers, had, hoped, that, nonoxynol, 9, a, vaginal, microbicide, would, help, decrease, sti, risk, trials, however, have, found, it, ineffective, and, it, may, put, women, at, a, higher, risk, of, hiv, infection, there, is, evidence, that, vaginal, dapivirine, probably, reduces, hiv, in, women, who, have, sex, with, men, other, types, of, vaginal, microbicides, have, not, demonstrated, effectiveness, for, hiv, or, stis, there, is, little, evidence, that, school, based, interventions, such, as, sexual, and, reproductive, health, education, programmes, on, contraceptive, choices, and, condoms, are, effective, on, improving, the, sexual, and, reproductive, health, of, adolescents, incentive, based, programmes, may, reduce, adolescent, pregnancy, but, more, data, is, needed, to, confirm, this, specific, age, groups, persons, who, participate, in, risky, sexual, behavior, or, those, have, certain, health, conditions, may, require, screening, the, cdc, recommends, that, sexually, active, women, under, the, age, of, 25, and, those, over, 25, at, risk, should, be, screened, for, chlamydia, and, gonorrhea, yearly, appropriate, times, for, screening, are, during, regular, pelvic, examinations, and, preconception, evaluations, nucleic, acid, amplification, tests, are, the, recommended, method, of, diagnosis, for, gonorrhea, and, chlamydia, this, can, be, done, on, either, urine, in, both, men, and, women, vaginal, or, cervical, swabs, in, women, or, urethral, swabs, in, men, screening, can, be, performed, in, the, case, of, rape, the, person, can, be, treated, prophylacticly, with, antibiotics, an, option, for, treating, partners, of, patients, index, cases, diagnosed, with, chlamydia, or, gonorrhea, is, patient, delivered, partner, therapy, which, is, the, clinical, practice, of, treating, the, sex, partners, of, index, cases, by, providing, prescriptions, or, medications, to, the, patient, to, take, to, their, partner, without, the, health, care, provider, first, examining, the, partner, in, term, of, preventing, reinfection, in, sexually, transmitted, infection, treatment, with, both, patient, and, the, sexual, partner, of, patient, resulted, in, more, successful, than, treatment, of, the, patient, without, the, sexual, partner, there, is, no, difference, in, reinfection, prevention, whether, the, sexual, partner, treated, with, medication, without, medical, examination, or, after, notification, by, patient, in, 2008, it, was, estimated, that, 500, million, people, were, infected, with, either, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, or, trichomoniasis, at, least, an, additional, 530, million, people, have, genital, herpes, and, 290, million, women, have, human, papillomavirus, hpv, stis, other, than, hiv, resulted, in, 142, 000, deaths, in, 2013, in, the, united, states, there, were, 19, million, new, cases, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, in, 2010, in, 2010, 19, million, new, cases, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, occurred, in, women, in, the, united, states, a, 2008, cdc, study, found, that, 25, 40, of, u, s, teenage, girls, has, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, out, of, a, population, of, almost, 295, 270, 000, people, there, were, 110, million, new, and, existing, cases, of, eight, sexually, transmitted, infections, over, 400, 000, sexually, transmitted, infections, were, reported, in, england, in, 2017, about, the, same, as, in, 2016, but, there, were, more, than, 20, increases, in, confirmed, cases, of, gonorrhoea, and, syphilis, since, 2008, syphilis, cases, have, risen, by, 148, from, 2, 874, to, 7, 137, mostly, among, men, who, have, sex, with, men, the, number, of, first, cases, of, genital, warts, in, 2017, among, girls, aged, 15, 17, years, was, just, 441, 90, less, than, in, 2009, attributed, to, the, national, hpv, immunisation, programme, aids, is, among, the, leading, causes, of, death, in, present, day, sub, saharan, africa, hiv, aids, is, transmitted, primarily, via, unprotected, sexual, intercourse, more, than, 1, 1, million, persons, are, living, with, hiv, aids, in, the, united, states, and, it, disproportionately, impacts, african, americans, hepatitis, b, is, also, considered, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, because, it, can, be, spread, through, sexual, contact, the, highest, rates, are, found, in, asia, and, africa, and, lower, rates, are, in, the, americas, and, europe, approximately, two, billion, people, worldwide, have, been, infected, with, the, hepatitis, b, virus, the, first, well, recorded, european, outbreak, of, what, is, now, known, as, syphilis, occurred, in, 1494, when, it, broke, out, among, french, troops, besieging, naples, in, the, italian, war, of, 1494, 98, the, disease, may, have, originated, from, the, columbian, exchange, from, naples, the, disease, swept, across, europe, killing, more, than, five, million, people, as, jared, diamond, describes, it, hen, syphilis, was, first, definitely, recorded, in, europe, in, 1495, its, pustules, often, covered, the, body, from, the, head, to, the, knees, caused, flesh, to, fall, from, people, s, faces, and, led, to, death, within, a, few, months, rendering, it, far, more, fatal, than, it, is, today, diamond, concludes, y, 1546, the, disease, had, evolved, into, the, disease, with, the, symptoms, so, well, known, to, us, today, gonorrhea, is, recorded, at, least, up, to, 700, years, ago, and, associated, with, a, district, in, paris, formerly, known, as, le, clapiers, this, is, where, the, prostitutes, were, to, be, found, at, that, time, prior, to, the, invention, of, modern, medicines, sexually, transmitted, infections, were, generally, incurable, and, treatment, was, limited, to, treating, the, symptoms, of, the, infection, the, first, voluntary, hospital, for, stis, was, founded, in, 1746, at, london, lock, hospital, treatment, was, not, always, voluntary, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, contagious, diseases, acts, were, used, to, arrest, suspected, prostitutes, in, 1924, a, number, of, states, concluded, the, brussels, agreement, whereby, states, agreed, to, provide, free, or, low, cost, medical, treatment, at, ports, for, merchant, seamen, with, stis, a, proponent, of, these, approaches, was, nora, wattie, obe, venereal, diseases, officer, in, glasgow, from, 1929, encouraged, contact, tracing, and, volunteering, for, treatment, rather, than, the, prevailing, more, judgemental, view, and, published, her, own, research, on, improving, sex, education, and, maternity, care, the, first, effective, treatment, for, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, was, salvarsan, a, treatment, for, syphilis, with, the, discovery, of, antibiotics, a, large, number, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, became, easily, curable, and, this, combined, with, effective, public, health, campaigns, against, stis, led, to, a, public, perception, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, that, they, have, ceased, to, be, a, serious, medical, threat, during, this, period, the, importance, of, contact, tracing, in, treating, stis, was, recognized, by, tracing, the, sexual, partners, of, infected, individuals, testing, them, for, infection, treating, the, infected, and, tracing, their, contacts, in, turn, sti, clinics, could, effectively, suppress, infections, in, the, general, population, in, the, 1980s, first, genital, herpes, and, then, aids, emerged, into, the, public, consciousness, as, sexually, transmitted, infections, that, could, not, be, cured, by, modern, medicine, aids, in, particular, has, a, long, asymptomatic, period, during, which, time, hiv, the, human, immunodeficiency, virus, which, causes, aids, can, replicate, and, the, disease, can, be, transmitted, to, others, followed, by, a, symptomatic, period, which, leads, rapidly, to, death, unless, treated, hiv, aids, entered, the, united, states, from, haiti, in, about, 1969, recognition, that, aids, threatened, a, global, pandemic, led, to, public, information, campaigns, and, the, development, of, treatments, that, allow, aids, to, be, managed, by, suppressing, the, replication, of, hiv, for, as, long, as, possible, contact, tracing, continues, to, be, an, important, measure, even, when, diseases, are, incurable, as, it, helps, to, contain, infection
