the, emu, i, m, ju, dromaius, novaehollandiae, is, a, species, of, flightless, bird, endemic, to, australia, where, it, is, the, tallest, native, bird, it, is, the, only, extant, member, of, the, genus, dromaius, and, the, third, tallest, living, bird, after, its, african, ratite, relatives, the, common, ostrich, and, somali, ostrich, the, emu, s, native, ranges, cover, most, of, the, australian, mainland, the, tasmanian, kangaroo, island, and, king, island, subspecies, became, extinct, after, the, european, settlement, of, australia, in, 1788, emus, have, soft, brown, feathers, with, long, necks, and, legs, and, can, reach, up, to, 1, 9, m, 6, ft, 3, in, in, height, they, are, robust, bipedal, runners, that, can, travel, great, distances, and, when, necessary, can, sprint, at, 48, km, h, 30, mph, they, are, omnivorous, and, forage, on, a, variety, of, plants, and, insects, and, can, go, for, weeks, without, eating, they, drink, infrequently, but, take, in, copious, amounts, of, fresh, water, when, the, opportunity, arises, breeding, takes, place, in, may, and, june, and, fighting, among, females, for, a, mate, is, common, females, can, mate, several, times, and, lay, several, clutches, of, eggs, in, one, season, the, male, does, the, incubation, during, this, process, he, hardly, eats, or, drinks, and, loses, a, significant, amount, of, weight, the, eggs, hatch, after, around, eight, weeks, and, the, young, are, nurtured, by, their, fathers, they, reach, full, size, after, around, six, months, but, can, remain, as, a, family, unit, until, the, next, breeding, season, the, bird, is, sufficiently, common, for, it, to, be, rated, as, a, least, concern, species, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, despite, this, some, local, populations, are, listed, as, endangered, with, all, the, insular, subspecies, going, extinct, by, the, 1800s, threats, to, their, survival, include, egg, predation, by, other, animals, especially, invasive, species, roadkills, and, habitat, fragmentation, the, emu, is, an, important, cultural, icon, of, australia, appearing, on, the, coat, of, arms, and, various, coinages, the, bird, features, prominently, in, indigenous, australian, mythologies, the, etymology, of, the, common, name, emu, is, uncertain, but, is, thought, to, have, come, from, an, arabic, word, for, large, bird, that, was, later, used, by, portuguese, explorers, to, describe, the, related, cassowary, in, australia, and, new, guinea, another, theory, is, that, it, comes, from, the, word, ema, which, is, used, in, portuguese, to, denote, a, large, bird, akin, to, an, ostrich, or, crane, in, victoria, some, terms, for, the, emu, were, barrimal, in, the, dja, dja, wurrung, language, myoure, in, gunai, and, courn, in, jardwadjali, the, birds, were, known, as, murawung, or, birabayin, to, the, local, eora, and, darug, inhabitants, of, the, sydney, basin, emus, were, first, reported, as, having, been, seen, by, europeans, when, explorers, visited, the, western, coast, of, australia, in, 1696, this, was, during, an, expedition, led, by, dutch, captain, willem, de, vlamingh, who, was, searching, for, survivors, of, a, ship, that, had, gone, missing, two, years, earlier, the, birds, were, known, on, the, eastern, coast, before, 1788, when, the, first, europeans, settled, there, the, birds, were, first, mentioned, under, the, name, of, the, new, holland, cassowary, in, arthur, phillip, s, voyage, to, botany, bay, published, in, 1789, with, the, following, description, this, is, a, species, differing, in, many, particulars, from, that, generally, known, and, is, a, much, larger, bird, standing, higher, on, its, legs, and, having, the, neck, longer, than, in, the, common, one, total, length, seven, feet, two, inches, the, bill, is, not, greatly, different, from, that, of, the, common, cassowary, but, the, horny, appendage, or, helmet, on, top, of, the, head, in, this, species, is, totally, wanting, the, whole, of, the, head, and, neck, is, also, covered, with, feathers, except, the, throat, and, fore, part, of, the, neck, about, half, way, which, are, not, so, well, feathered, as, the, rest, whereas, in, the, common, cassowary, the, head, and, neck, are, bare, and, carunculated, as, in, the, turkey, the, plumage, in, general, consists, of, a, mixture, of, brown, and, grey, and, the, feathers, are, somewhat, curled, or, bent, at, the, ends, in, the, natural, state, the, wings, are, so, very, short, as, to, be, totally, useless, for, flight, and, indeed, are, scarcely, to, be, distinguished, from, the, rest, of, the, plumage, were, it, not, for, their, standing, out, a, little, the, long, spines, which, are, seen, in, the, wings, of, the, common, sort, are, in, this, not, observable, nor, is, there, any, appearance, of, a, tail, the, legs, are, stout, formed, much, as, in, the, galeated, cassowary, with, the, addition, of, their, being, jagged, or, sawed, the, whole, of, their, length, at, the, back, part, the, species, was, named, by, ornithologist, john, latham, in, 1790, based, on, a, specimen, from, the, sydney, area, of, australia, a, country, which, was, known, as, new, holland, at, the, time, he, collaborated, on, phillip, s, book, and, provided, the, first, descriptions, of, and, names, for, many, australian, bird, species, dromaius, comes, from, a, greek, word, meaning, racer, and, novaehollandiae, is, the, latin, term, for, new, holland, so, the, name, can, be, rendered, as, fast, footed, new, hollander, in, his, original, 1816, description, of, the, emu, the, french, ornithologist, louis, pierre, vieillot, used, two, generic, names, first, dromiceius, and, later, dromaius, it, has, been, a, point, of, contention, ever, since, as, to, which, name, should, be, used, the, latter, is, more, correctly, formed, but, the, convention, in, taxonomy, is, that, the, first, name, given, to, an, organism, stands, unless, it, is, clearly, a, typographical, error, most, modern, publications, including, those, of, the, australian, government, use, dromaius, with, dromiceius, mentioned, as, an, alternative, spelling, the, emu, was, long, classified, with, its, closest, relatives, the, cassowaries, in, the, family, casuariidae, part, of, the, ratite, order, struthioniformes, an, alternate, classification, was, proposed, in, 2014, by, mitchell, et, al, based, on, analysis, of, mitochondrial, dna, this, splits, off, the, casuariidae, into, their, own, order, the, casuariformes, and, includes, only, the, cassowaries, in, the, family, casuariidae, placing, the, emus, in, their, own, family, dromaiidae, the, cladogram, shown, below, is, from, their, study, aepyornithidae, elephant, birds, apterygidae, kiwi, dromaiidae, emus, casuariidae, cassowaries, dinornithiformes, moa, tinamidae, tinamous, rheidae, rheas, struthionidae, ostriches, two, different, dromaius, species, were, present, in, australia, at, the, time, of, european, settlement, and, one, additional, species, is, known, from, fossil, remains, the, insular, dwarf, emus, d, n, baudinianus, and, d, n, minor, originally, present, on, kangaroo, island, and, king, island, respectively, both, became, extinct, shortly, after, the, arrival, of, europeans, d, n, diemenensis, another, insular, dwarf, emu, from, tasmania, became, extinct, around, 1865, the, mainland, subspecies, d, n, novaehollandiae, remains, common, the, population, of, these, birds, varies, from, decade, to, decade, largely, being, dependent, on, rainfall, in, 2009, it, was, estimated, that, there, were, between, 630, 000, and, 725, 000, birds, emus, were, introduced, to, maria, island, off, tasmania, and, kangaroo, island, off, the, coast, of, south, australia, during, the, 20th, century, the, maria, island, population, died, out, in, the, mid, 1990s, the, kangaroo, island, birds, have, successfully, established, a, breeding, population, in, 1912, the, australian, ornithologist, gregory, m, mathews, recognised, three, living, subspecies, of, emu, d, n, novaehollandiae, latham, 1790, d, n, woodwardi, mathews, 1912, and, d, n, rothschildi, mathews, 1912, the, handbook, of, the, birds, of, the, world, however, argues, that, the, last, two, of, these, subspecies, are, invalid, natural, variations, in, plumage, colour, and, the, nomadic, nature, of, the, species, make, it, likely, that, there, is, a, single, race, in, mainland, australia, examination, of, the, dna, of, the, king, island, emu, shows, this, bird, to, be, closely, related, to, the, mainland, emu, and, hence, best, treated, as, a, subspecies, the, emu, is, the, second, tallest, bird, in, the, world, only, being, exceeded, in, height, by, the, ostrich, the, largest, individuals, can, reach, up, to, 150, to, 190, cm, 59, to, 75, in, in, height, measured, from, the, bill, to, the, tail, emus, range, in, length, from, 139, to, 164, cm, 55, to, 65, in, with, males, averaging, 148, 5, cm, 58, 5, in, and, females, averaging, 156, 8, cm, 61, 7, in, emus, are, the, fourth, or, fifth, heaviest, living, bird, after, the, two, species, of, ostrich, and, two, larger, species, of, cassowary, weighing, slightly, more, on, average, than, an, emperor, penguin, adult, emus, weigh, between, 18, and, 60, kg, 40, and, 132, lb, with, an, average, of, 31, 5, and, 37, kg, 69, and, 82, lb, in, males, and, females, respectively, females, are, usually, slightly, larger, than, males, and, are, substantially, wider, across, the, rump, although, flightless, emus, have, vestigial, wings, the, wing, chord, measuring, around, 20, cm, 8, in, and, each, wing, having, a, small, claw, at, the, tip, emus, flap, their, wings, when, running, perhaps, as, a, means, of, stabilising, themselves, when, moving, fast, they, have, long, necks, and, legs, and, can, run, at, speeds, of, 48, km, h, 30, mph, due, to, their, highly, specialised, pelvic, limb, musculature, their, feet, have, only, three, toes, and, a, similarly, reduced, number, of, bones, and, associated, foot, muscles, emus, are, unique, among, birds, in, that, their, gastrocnemius, muscles, in, the, back, of, the, lower, legs, have, four, bellies, instead, of, the, usual, three, the, pelvic, limb, muscles, of, emus, contribute, a, similar, proportion, of, the, total, body, mass, as, do, the, flight, muscles, of, flying, birds, when, walking, the, emu, takes, strides, of, about, 100, cm, 3, 3, ft, but, at, full, gallop, a, stride, can, be, as, long, as, 275, cm, 9, ft, its, legs, are, devoid, of, feathers, and, underneath, its, feet, are, thick, cushioned, pads, like, the, cassowary, the, emu, has, sharp, claws, on, its, toes, which, are, its, major, defensive, attribute, and, are, used, in, combat, to, inflict, wounds, on, opponents, by, kicking, the, toe, and, claw, total, 15, cm, 6, in, in, length, the, bill, is, quite, small, measuring, 5, 6, to, 6, 7, cm, 2, 2, to, 2, 6, in, and, is, soft, being, adapted, for, grazing, emus, have, good, eyesight, and, hearing, which, allows, them, to, detect, threats, at, some, distance, the, neck, of, the, emu, is, pale, blue, and, shows, through, its, sparse, feathers, they, have, grey, brown, plumage, of, shaggy, appearance, the, shafts, and, the, tips, of, the, feathers, are, black, solar, radiation, is, absorbed, by, the, tips, and, the, inner, plumage, insulates, the, skin, this, prevents, the, birds, from, overheating, allowing, them, to, be, active, during, the, heat, of, the, day, a, unique, feature, of, the, emu, feather, is, the, double, rachis, emerging, from, a, single, shaft, both, of, the, rachis, have, the, same, length, and, the, texture, is, variable, the, area, near, the, skin, is, rather, furry, but, the, more, distant, ends, resemble, grass, the, sexes, are, similar, in, appearance, although, the, male, s, penis, can, become, visible, when, he, urinates, and, defecates, the, plumage, varies, in, colour, due, to, environmental, factors, giving, the, bird, a, natural, camouflage, feathers, of, emus, in, more, arid, areas, with, red, soils, have, a, rufous, tint, while, birds, residing, in, damp, conditions, are, generally, darker, in, hue, the, juvenile, plumage, develops, at, about, three, months, and, is, blackish, finely, barred, with, brown, with, the, head, and, neck, being, especially, dark, the, facial, feathers, gradually, thin, to, expose, the, bluish, skin, the, adult, plumage, has, developed, by, about, fifteen, months, the, eyes, of, an, emu, are, protected, by, nictitating, membranes, these, are, translucent, secondary, eyelids, that, move, horizontally, from, the, inside, edge, of, the, eye, to, the, outside, edge, they, function, as, visors, to, protect, the, eyes, from, the, dust, that, is, prevalent, in, windy, arid, regions, emus, have, a, tracheal, pouch, which, becomes, more, prominent, during, the, mating, season, at, more, than, 30, cm, 12, in, in, length, it, is, quite, spacious, it, has, a, thin, wall, and, an, opening, 8, centimetres, 3, in, long, once, common, on, the, east, coast, of, australia, emus, are, now, uncommon, there, by, contrast, the, development, of, agriculture, and, the, provision, of, water, for, stock, in, the, interior, of, the, continent, have, increased, the, range, of, the, emu, in, arid, regions, emus, live, in, various, habitats, across, australia, both, inland, and, near, the, coast, they, are, most, common, in, areas, of, savannah, woodland, and, sclerophyll, forest, and, least, common, in, heavily, populated, districts, and, arid, areas, with, annual, precipitation, of, less, than, 600, millimetres, 24, in, emus, predominantly, travel, in, pairs, and, while, they, can, form, large, flocks, this, is, an, atypical, social, behaviour, that, arises, from, the, common, need, to, move, towards, a, new, food, source, emus, have, been, shown, to, travel, long, distances, to, reach, abundant, feeding, areas, in, western, australia, emu, movements, follow, a, distinct, seasonal, pattern, north, in, summer, and, south, in, winter, on, the, east, coast, their, wanderings, seem, to, be, more, random, and, do, not, appear, to, follow, a, set, pattern, emus, are, diurnal, birds, and, spend, their, day, foraging, preening, their, plumage, with, their, beak, dust, bathing, and, resting, they, are, generally, gregarious, birds, apart, from, the, breeding, season, and, while, some, forage, others, remain, vigilant, to, their, mutual, benefit, they, are, able, to, swim, when, necessary, although, they, rarely, do, so, unless, the, area, is, flooded, or, they, need, to, cross, a, river, emus, begin, to, settle, down, at, sunset, and, sleep, during, the, night, they, do, not, sleep, continuously, but, rouse, themselves, several, times, during, the, night, when, falling, asleep, emus, first, squat, on, their, tarsi, and, enter, a, drowsy, state, during, which, they, are, alert, enough, to, react, to, stimuli, and, quickly, return, to, a, fully, awakened, state, if, disturbed, as, they, fall, into, deeper, sleep, their, neck, droops, closer, to, the, body, and, the, eyelids, begin, to, close, if, there, are, no, disturbances, they, fall, into, a, deeper, sleep, after, about, twenty, minutes, during, this, phase, the, body, is, gradually, lowered, until, it, is, touching, the, ground, with, the, legs, folded, underneath, the, beak, is, turned, down, so, that, the, whole, neck, becomes, s, shaped, and, folded, onto, itself, the, feathers, direct, any, rain, downwards, onto, the, ground, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, sleeping, position, is, a, type, of, camouflage, mimicking, a, small, mound, emus, typically, awake, from, deep, sleep, once, every, ninety, minutes, or, so, and, stand, upright, to, feed, briefly, or, defecate, this, period, of, wakefulness, lasts, for, ten, to, twenty, minutes, after, which, they, return, to, slumber, overall, an, emu, sleeps, for, around, seven, hours, in, each, twenty, four, hour, period, young, emus, usually, sleep, with, their, neck, flat, and, stretched, forward, along, the, ground, surface, the, vocalisations, of, emus, mostly, consist, of, various, booming, and, grunting, sounds, the, booming, is, created, by, the, inflatable, throat, pouch, the, pitch, can, be, regulated, by, the, bird, and, depends, on, the, size, of, the, aperture, most, of, the, booming, is, done, by, females, it, is, part, of, the, courtship, ritual, is, used, to, announce, the, holding, of, territory, and, is, issued, as, a, threat, to, rivals, a, high, intensity, boom, is, audible, 2, kilometres, 1, 2, mi, away, while, a, low, more, resonant, call, produced, during, the, breeding, season, may, at, first, attract, mates, and, peaks, while, the, male, is, incubating, the, eggs, most, of, the, grunting, is, done, by, males, it, is, used, principally, during, the, breeding, season, in, territorial, defence, as, a, threat, to, other, males, during, courtship, and, while, the, female, is, laying, both, sexes, sometimes, boom, or, grunt, during, threat, displays, or, on, encountering, strange, objects, on, very, hot, days, emus, pant, to, maintain, their, body, temperature, their, lungs, work, as, evaporative, coolers, and, unlike, some, other, species, the, resulting, low, levels, of, carbon, dioxide, in, the, blood, do, not, appear, to, cause, alkalosis, for, normal, breathing, in, cooler, weather, they, have, large, multifolded, nasal, passages, cool, air, warms, as, it, passes, through, into, the, lungs, extracting, heat, from, the, nasal, region, on, exhalation, the, emu, s, cold, nasal, turbinates, condense, moisture, back, out, of, the, air, and, absorb, it, for, reuse, as, with, other, ratites, the, emu, has, great, homeothermic, ability, and, can, maintain, this, status, from, 5, to, 45, c, 23, to, 113, f, the, thermoneutral, zone, of, emus, lies, between, 10, and, 30, c, 50, and, 86, f, as, with, other, ratites, emus, have, a, relatively, low, basal, metabolic, rate, compared, to, other, types, of, birds, at, 5, c, 23, f, the, metabolic, rate, of, an, emu, sitting, down, is, about, 60, of, that, when, standing, partly, because, the, lack, of, feathers, under, the, stomach, leads, to, a, higher, rate, of, heat, loss, when, standing, from, the, exposed, underbelly, emus, forage, in, a, diurnal, pattern, and, eat, a, variety, of, native, and, introduced, plant, species, the, diet, depends, on, seasonal, availability, with, such, plants, as, acacia, casuarina, and, grasses, being, favoured, they, also, eat, insects, and, other, arthropods, including, grasshoppers, and, crickets, beetles, cockroaches, ladybirds, bogong, and, cotton, boll, moth, larvae, ants, spiders, and, millipedes, this, provides, a, large, part, of, their, protein, requirements, in, western, australia, food, preferences, have, been, observed, in, travelling, emus, they, eat, seeds, from, acacia, aneura, until, the, rains, arrive, after, which, they, move, on, to, fresh, grass, shoots, and, caterpillars, in, winter, they, feed, on, the, leaves, and, pods, of, cassia, and, in, spring, they, consume, grasshoppers, and, the, fruit, of, santalum, acuminatum, a, sort, of, quandong, they, are, also, known, to, feed, on, wheat, and, any, fruit, or, other, crops, that, they, can, access, easily, climbing, over, high, fences, if, necessary, emus, serve, as, an, important, agent, for, the, dispersal, of, large, viable, seeds, which, contributes, to, floral, biodiversity, one, undesirable, effect, of, this, occurred, in, queensland, in, the, early, twentieth, century, when, emus, fed, on, the, fruit, of, prickly, pears, in, the, outback, they, defecated, the, seeds, in, various, places, as, they, moved, around, and, this, led, to, a, series, of, campaigns, to, hunt, emus, and, prevent, the, seeds, of, the, invasive, cactus, being, spread, the, cacti, were, eventually, controlled, by, an, introduced, moth, cactoblastis, cactorum, whose, larvae, fed, on, the, plant, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, biological, control, the, 13, c, of, the, emu, s, diet, is, reflected, in, the, 13, c, of, the, calcite, of, its, egg, shell, small, stones, are, swallowed, to, assist, in, the, grinding, up, and, digestion, of, the, plant, material, individual, stones, may, weigh, 45, g, 1, 6, oz, and, the, birds, may, have, as, much, as, 745, g, 1, 642, lb, in, their, gizzards, at, one, time, they, also, eat, charcoal, although, the, reason, for, this, is, unclear, captive, emus, have, been, known, to, eat, shards, of, glass, marbles, car, keys, jewellery, and, nuts, and, bolts, emus, drink, infrequently, but, ingest, large, amounts, when, the, opportunity, arises, they, typically, drink, once, a, day, first, inspecting, the, water, body, and, surrounding, area, in, groups, before, kneeling, down, at, the, edge, to, drink, they, prefer, being, on, firm, ground, while, drinking, rather, than, on, rocks, or, mud, but, if, they, sense, danger, they, often, stand, rather, than, kneel, if, not, disturbed, they, may, drink, continuously, for, ten, minutes, due, to, the, scarcity, of, water, sources, emus, are, sometimes, forced, to, go, without, water, for, several, days, in, the, wild, they, often, share, water, holes, with, other, animals, such, as, kangaroos, they, are, wary, and, tend, to, wait, for, the, other, animals, to, leave, before, drinking, emus, form, breeding, pairs, during, the, summer, months, of, december, and, january, and, may, remain, together, for, about, five, months, during, this, time, they, stay, in, an, area, a, few, kilometres, in, diameter, and, it, is, believed, they, find, and, defend, territory, within, this, area, both, males, and, females, put, on, weight, during, the, breeding, season, with, the, female, becoming, slightly, heavier, at, between, 45, and, 58, kg, 99, and, 128, lb, mating, usually, takes, place, between, april, and, june, the, exact, timing, is, determined, by, the, climate, as, the, birds, nest, during, the, coolest, part, of, the, year, during, the, breeding, season, males, experience, hormonal, changes, including, an, increase, in, luteinising, hormone, and, testosterone, levels, and, their, testicles, double, in, size, males, construct, a, rough, nest, in, a, semi, sheltered, hollow, on, the, ground, using, bark, grass, sticks, and, leaves, to, line, it, the, nest, is, almost, always, a, flat, surface, rather, than, a, segment, of, a, sphere, although, in, cold, conditions, the, nest, is, taller, up, to, 7, cm, 2, 8, in, tall, and, more, spherical, to, provide, some, extra, heat, retention, when, other, material, is, lacking, the, bird, sometimes, uses, a, spinifex, tussock, a, metre, or, so, across, despite, the, prickly, nature, of, the, foliage, the, nest, can, be, placed, on, open, ground, or, near, a, shrub, or, rock, the, nest, is, usually, placed, in, an, area, where, the, emu, has, a, clear, view, of, its, surroundings, and, can, detect, approaching, predators, the, nest, can, contain, eggs, from, multiple, emus, the, number, is, usually, between, 15, and, 25, eggs, female, emus, court, the, males, the, female, s, plumage, darkens, slightly, and, the, small, patches, of, bare, featherless, skin, just, below, the, eyes, and, near, the, beak, turn, turquoise, blue, the, colour, of, the, male, s, plumage, remains, unchanged, although, the, bare, patches, of, skin, also, turn, light, blue, when, courting, females, stride, around, pulling, their, neck, back, while, puffing, out, their, feathers, and, emitting, low, monosyllabic, calls, that, have, been, compared, to, drum, beats, this, calling, can, occur, when, males, are, out, of, sight, or, more, than, 50, metres, 160, ft, away, once, the, male, s, attention, has, been, gained, the, female, circles, her, prospective, mate, at, a, distance, of, 10, to, 40, metres, 30, to, 130, ft, as, she, does, this, she, looks, at, him, by, turning, her, neck, while, at, the, same, time, keeping, her, rump, facing, towards, him, if, the, male, shows, interest, in, the, parading, female, he, will, move, closer, the, female, continues, the, courtship, by, shuffling, further, away, but, continuing, to, circle, him, if, a, male, is, interested, he, will, stretch, his, neck, and, erect, his, feathers, then, bend, over, and, peck, at, the, ground, he, will, circle, around, and, sidle, up, to, the, female, swaying, his, body, and, neck, from, side, to, side, and, rubbing, his, breast, against, his, partner, s, rump, often, the, female, will, reject, his, advances, with, aggression, but, if, amenable, she, signals, acceptance, by, squatting, down, and, raising, her, rump, females, are, more, aggressive, than, males, during, the, courtship, period, often, fighting, for, access, to, mates, with, fights, among, females, accounting, for, more, than, half, the, aggressive, interactions, during, this, period, if, females, court, a, male, that, already, has, a, partner, the, incumbent, female, will, try, to, repel, the, competitor, usually, by, chasing, and, kicking, these, interactions, can, be, prolonged, lasting, up, to, five, hours, especially, when, the, male, being, fought, over, is, single, and, neither, female, has, the, advantage, of, incumbency, in, these, cases, the, females, typically, intensify, their, calls, and, displays, the, sperm, from, a, mating, is, stored, by, the, female, and, can, suffice, to, fertilise, about, six, eggs, the, pair, mate, every, day, or, two, and, every, second, or, third, day, the, female, lays, one, of, a, clutch, of, five, to, fifteen, very, large, thick, shelled, green, eggs, the, shell, is, around, 1, mm, 0, 04, in, thick, but, rather, thinner, in, northern, regions, according, to, indigenous, australians, the, shell, is, substantially, composed, of, calcite, and, its, 13, c, is, a, function, of, the, emu, s, diet, the, eggs, are, on, average, 13, cm, 9, cm, 5, 1, in, 3, 5, in, and, weigh, between, 450, and, 650, g, 1, 0, and, 1, 4, lb, the, maternal, investment, in, the, egg, is, considerable, and, the, proportion, of, yolk, to, albumen, at, about, 50, is, greater, than, would, be, predicted, for, a, precocial, egg, of, this, size, this, probably, relates, to, the, long, incubation, period, which, means, the, developing, chick, must, consume, greater, resources, before, hatching, the, first, verified, occurrence, of, genetically, identical, avian, twins, was, demonstrated, in, the, emu, the, egg, surface, is, granulated, and, pale, green, during, the, incubation, period, the, egg, turns, dark, green, although, if, the, egg, never, hatches, it, will, turn, white, from, the, bleaching, effect, of, the, sun, the, male, becomes, broody, after, his, mate, starts, laying, and, may, begin, to, incubate, the, eggs, before, the, clutch, is, complete, from, this, time, on, he, does, not, eat, drink, or, defecate, and, stands, only, to, turn, the, eggs, which, he, does, about, ten, times, a, day, he, develops, a, brood, patch, a, bare, area, of, wrinkled, skin, which, is, in, intimate, contact, with, the, eggs, over, the, course, of, the, eight, week, incubation, period, he, will, lose, a, third, of, his, weight, and, will, survive, on, stored, body, fat, and, on, any, morning, dew, that, he, can, reach, from, the, nest, as, with, many, other, australian, birds, such, as, the, superb, fairywren, infidelity, is, the, norm, for, emus, despite, the, initial, pair, bond, once, the, male, starts, brooding, the, female, usually, wanders, off, and, may, mate, with, other, males, and, lay, in, multiple, nests, thus, as, many, as, half, the, chicks, in, a, brood, may, not, be, fathered, by, the, incubating, male, or, even, by, either, parent, as, emus, also, exhibit, brood, parasitism, some, females, stay, and, defend, the, nest, until, the, chicks, start, hatching, but, most, leave, the, nesting, area, completely, to, nest, again, in, a, good, season, a, female, emu, may, nest, three, times, if, the, parents, stay, together, during, the, incubation, period, they, will, take, turns, standing, guard, over, the, eggs, while, the, other, drinks, and, feeds, within, earshot, if, it, perceives, a, threat, during, this, period, it, will, lie, down, on, top, of, the, nest, and, try, to, blend, in, with, the, similar, looking, surrounds, and, suddenly, stand, up, to, confront, and, scare, the, other, party, if, it, comes, close, incubation, takes, 56, days, and, the, male, stops, incubating, the, eggs, shortly, before, they, hatch, the, temperature, of, the, nest, rises, slightly, during, the, eight, week, period, although, the, eggs, are, laid, sequentially, they, tend, to, hatch, within, two, days, of, one, another, as, the, eggs, that, were, laid, later, experienced, higher, temperatures, and, developed, more, rapidly, during, the, process, the, precocial, emu, chicks, need, to, develop, a, capacity, for, thermoregulation, during, incubation, the, embryos, are, kept, at, a, constant, temperature, but, the, chicks, will, need, to, be, able, to, cope, with, varying, external, temperatures, by, the, time, they, hatch, newly, hatched, chicks, are, active, and, can, leave, the, nest, within, a, few, days, of, hatching, they, stand, about, 12, cm, 5, in, tall, at, first, weigh, 0, 5, kg, 17, 6, oz, and, have, distinctive, brown, and, cream, stripes, for, camouflage, which, fade, after, three, months, or, so, the, male, guards, the, growing, chicks, for, up, to, seven, months, teaching, them, how, to, find, food, chicks, grow, very, quickly, and, are, fully, grown, in, five, to, six, months, they, may, remain, with, their, family, group, for, another, six, months, or, so, before, they, split, up, to, breed, in, their, second, season, during, their, early, life, the, young, emus, are, defended, by, their, father, who, adopts, a, belligerent, stance, towards, other, emus, including, the, mother, he, does, this, by, ruffling, his, feathers, emitting, sharp, grunts, and, kicking, his, legs, to, drive, off, other, animals, he, can, also, bend, his, knees, to, crouch, over, smaller, chicks, to, protect, them, at, night, he, envelops, his, young, with, his, feathers, as, the, young, emus, cannot, travel, far, the, parents, must, choose, an, area, with, plentiful, food, in, which, to, breed, in, the, wild, emus, can, live, for, upwards, of, 10, years, but, in, captivity, they, can, live, up, to, 20, years, there, are, few, native, natural, predators, of, adult, emus, still, extant, early, in, its, species, history, it, may, have, faced, numerous, terrestrial, predators, now, extinct, including, the, giant, lizard, megalania, the, thylacine, and, possibly, other, carnivorous, marsupials, which, may, explain, their, seemingly, well, developed, ability, to, defend, themselves, from, terrestrial, predators, the, main, predator, of, emus, today, is, the, dingo, which, was, originally, introduced, by, aboriginals, thousands, of, years, ago, from, a, stock, of, semi, domesticated, wolves, dingoes, try, to, kill, the, emu, by, attacking, the, head, the, emu, typically, tries, to, repel, the, dingo, by, jumping, into, the, air, and, kicking, or, stamping, the, dingo, on, its, way, down, the, emu, jumps, as, the, dingo, barely, has, the, capacity, to, jump, high, enough, to, threaten, its, neck, so, a, correctly, timed, leap, to, coincide, with, the, dingo, s, lunge, can, keep, its, head, and, neck, out, of, danger, despite, the, potential, prey, predator, relationship, the, presence, of, predaceous, dingoes, does, not, appear, to, heavily, influence, emu, numbers, with, other, natural, conditions, just, as, likely, to, cause, mortality, wedge, tailed, eagles, are, the, only, avian, predator, capable, of, attacking, fully, grown, emus, though, are, perhaps, most, likely, to, take, small, or, young, specimens, the, eagles, attack, emus, by, swooping, downwards, rapidly, and, at, high, speed, and, aiming, for, the, head, and, neck, in, this, case, the, emu, s, jumping, technique, as, employed, against, the, dingo, is, not, useful, the, birds, try, to, target, the, emu, in, the, open, ground, so, that, it, cannot, hide, behind, obstacles, under, such, circumstances, the, emu, runs, in, a, chaotic, manner, and, changes, directions, frequently, to, try, to, evade, its, attacker, while, full, grown, adults, are, rarely, preyed, upon, dingos, raptors, monitor, lizards, introduced, red, foxes, feral, and, domestic, dogs, and, feral, pigs, occasionally, feed, on, emu, eggs, or, kill, small, chicks, adult, males, fiercely, defend, their, chicks, from, predators, especially, dingos, and, foxes, emus, can, suffer, from, both, external, and, internal, parasites, but, under, farmed, conditions, are, more, parasite, free, than, ostriches, or, rheas, external, parasites, include, the, louse, dahlemhornia, asymmetrica, and, various, other, lice, ticks, mites, and, flies, chicks, sometimes, suffer, from, intestinal, tract, infections, caused, by, coccidian, protozoa, and, the, nematode, trichostrongylus, tenuis, infects, the, emu, as, well, as, a, wide, range, of, other, birds, causing, haemorrhagic, diarrhoea, other, nematodes, are, found, in, the, trachea, and, bronchi, syngamus, trachea, causing, haemorrhagic, tracheitis, and, cyathostoma, variegatum, causing, serious, respiratory, problems, in, juveniles, emus, were, used, as, a, source, of, food, by, indigenous, australians, and, early, european, settlers, emus, are, inquisitive, birds, and, have, been, known, to, approach, humans, if, they, see, unexpected, movement, of, a, limb, or, piece, of, clothing, in, the, wild, they, may, follow, and, observe, people, aboriginal, australians, used, a, variety, of, techniques, to, catch, the, birds, including, spearing, them, while, they, drank, at, waterholes, catching, them, in, nets, and, attracting, them, by, imitating, their, calls, or, by, arousing, their, curiosity, with, a, ball, of, feathers, and, rags, dangled, from, a, tree, the, pitchuri, thornapple, duboisia, hopwoodii, or, some, similar, poisonous, plant, could, be, used, to, contaminate, a, waterhole, after, which, the, disoriented, emus, were, easy, to, catch, another, stratagem, was, for, the, hunter, to, use, a, skin, as, a, disguise, and, the, birds, could, be, lured, into, a, camouflaged, pit, trap, using, rags, or, imitation, calls, aboriginal, australians, only, killed, emus, out, of, necessity, and, frowned, on, anyone, who, hunted, them, for, any, other, reason, every, part, of, the, carcass, had, some, use, the, fat, was, harvested, for, its, valuable, multiple, use, oil, the, bones, were, shaped, into, knives, and, tools, the, feathers, were, used, for, body, adornment, and, the, tendons, substituted, for, string, the, early, european, settlers, killed, emus, to, provide, food, and, used, their, fat, for, fuelling, lamps, they, also, tried, to, prevent, them, from, interfering, with, farming, or, invading, settlements, in, search, of, water, during, drought, an, extreme, example, of, this, was, the, emu, war, in, western, australia, in, 1932, emus, flocked, to, the, chandler, and, walgoolan, area, during, a, dry, spell, damaging, rabbit, fencing, and, devastating, crops, an, attempt, to, drive, them, off, was, mounted, with, the, army, called, in, to, dispatch, them, with, machine, guns, the, emus, largely, avoided, the, hunters, emus, are, large, powerful, birds, and, their, legs, are, among, the, strongest, of, any, animal, and, powerful, enough, to, tear, down, metal, fencing, the, birds, are, very, defensive, of, their, young, and, there, have, been, two, documented, cases, of, humans, being, attacked, by, emus, in, the, areas, in, which, it, was, endemic, the, emu, was, an, important, source, of, meat, to, aboriginal, australians, they, used, the, fat, as, bush, medicine, and, rubbed, it, into, their, skin, it, served, as, a, valuable, lubricant, was, used, to, oil, wooden, tools, and, utensils, such, as, the, coolamon, and, was, mixed, with, ochre, to, make, the, traditional, paint, for, ceremonial, body, adornment, their, eggs, were, also, foraged, for, food, an, example, of, how, the, emu, was, cooked, comes, from, the, arrernte, of, central, australia, who, called, it, kere, ankerre, emus, are, around, all, the, time, in, green, times, and, dry, times, you, pluck, the, feathers, out, first, then, pull, out, the, crop, from, the, stomach, and, put, in, the, feathers, you, ve, pulled, out, and, then, singe, it, on, the, fire, you, wrap, the, milk, guts, that, you, ve, pulled, out, into, something, gum, leaves, and, cook, them, when, you, ve, got, the, fat, off, you, cut, the, meat, up, and, cook, it, on, fire, made, from, river, red, gum, wood, the, birds, were, a, food, and, fuel, source, for, early, european, settlers, and, are, now, farmed, in, australia, and, elsewhere, for, their, meat, oil, and, leather, commercial, emu, farming, started, in, western, australia, around, 1970, the, commercial, industry, in, the, country, is, based, on, stock, bred, in, captivity, and, all, states, except, tasmania, have, licensing, requirements, to, protect, wild, emus, outside, australia, emus, are, farmed, on, a, large, scale, in, north, america, with, about, 1, million, birds, in, the, us, peru, and, china, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, some, other, countries, emus, breed, well, in, captivity, and, are, kept, in, large, open, pens, to, avoid, the, leg, and, digestive, problems, that, arise, from, inactivity, they, are, typically, fed, on, grain, supplemented, by, grazing, and, are, slaughtered, at, 15, to, 18, months, the, salem, district, administration, in, india, advised, farmers, in, 2012, not, to, invest, in, the, emu, business, which, was, being, heavily, promoted, at, the, time, further, investigation, was, needed, to, assess, the, profitability, of, farming, the, birds, in, india, in, the, united, states, it, was, reported, in, 2013, that, many, ranchers, had, left, the, emu, business, it, was, estimated, that, the, number, of, growers, had, dropped, from, over, five, thousand, in, 1998, to, one, or, two, thousand, in, 2013, the, remaining, growers, increasingly, rely, on, sales, of, oil, for, their, profit, although, leather, eggs, and, meat, are, also, sold, emus, are, farmed, primarily, for, their, meat, leather, feathers, and, oil, and, 95, of, the, carcass, can, be, used, emu, meat, is, a, low, fat, product, less, than, 1, 5, fat, and, is, comparable, to, other, lean, meats, most, of, the, usable, portions, the, best, cuts, come, from, the, thigh, and, the, larger, muscles, of, the, drum, or, lower, leg, are, like, other, poultry, dark, meat, emu, meat, is, considered, for, cooking, purposes, by, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, to, be, a, red, meat, because, its, red, colour, and, ph, value, approximate, that, of, beef, but, for, inspection, purposes, it, is, considered, to, be, poultry, emu, fat, is, rendered, to, produce, oil, for, cosmetics, dietary, supplements, and, therapeutic, products, the, oil, is, obtained, from, the, subcutaneous, and, retroperitoneal, fat, the, macerated, adipose, tissue, is, heated, and, the, liquefied, fat, is, filtered, to, get, a, clear, oil, this, consists, mainly, of, fatty, acids, of, which, oleic, acid, 42, linoleic, and, palmitic, acids, 21, each, are, the, most, prominent, components, it, also, contains, various, anti, oxidants, notably, carotenoids, and, flavones, there, is, some, evidence, that, the, oil, has, anti, inflammatory, properties, however, there, have, not, yet, been, extensive, tests, and, the, usda, regards, pure, emu, oil, as, an, unapproved, drug, and, highlighted, it, in, a, 2009, article, entitled, how, to, spot, health, fraud, nevertheless, the, oil, has, been, linked, to, the, easing, of, gastrointestinal, inflammation, and, tests, on, rats, have, shown, that, it, has, a, significant, effect, in, treating, arthritis, and, joint, pain, more, so, than, olive, or, fish, oils, it, has, been, scientifically, shown, to, improve, the, rate, of, wound, healing, but, the, mechanism, responsible, for, this, effect, is, not, understood, a, 2008, study, has, claimed, that, emu, oil, has, a, better, anti, oxidative, and, anti, inflammatory, potential, than, ostrich, oil, and, linked, this, to, emu, oil, s, higher, proportion, of, unsaturated, to, saturated, fatty, acids, while, there, are, no, scientific, studies, showing, that, emu, oil, is, effective, in, humans, it, is, marketed, and, promoted, as, a, dietary, supplement, with, a, wide, variety, of, claimed, health, benefits, commercially, marketed, emu, oil, supplements, are, poorly, standardised, emu, leather, has, a, distinctive, patterned, surface, due, to, a, raised, area, around, the, feather, follicles, in, the, skin, the, leather, is, used, in, such, items, as, wallets, handbags, shoes, and, clothes, often, in, combination, with, other, leathers, the, feathers, and, eggs, are, used, in, decorative, arts, and, crafts, in, particular, emptied, emu, eggs, have, been, engraved, with, portraits, similar, to, cameos, and, scenes, of, australian, native, animals, mounted, emu, eggs, and, emu, egg, containers, in, the, form, of, hundreds, of, goblets, inkstands, and, vases, were, produced, in, the, second, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, all, richly, embellished, with, images, of, australian, flora, fauna, and, indigenous, people, by, travelling, silversmiths, founders, of, a, new, australian, grammar, of, ornament, they, continued, longstanding, traditions, that, can, be, traced, back, to, the, european, mounted, ostrich, eggs, of, the, thirteenth, century, and, christian, symbolism, and, notions, of, virginity, fertility, faith, and, strength, for, a, society, of, proud, settlers, who, sought, to, bring, culture, and, civilisation, to, their, new, world, the, traditional, ostrich, egg, goblet, freed, from, its, roots, in, a, society, dominated, by, court, culture, was, creatively, made, novel, in, the, australian, colonies, as, forms, and, functions, were, invented, to, make, the, objects, attractive, to, a, new, broader, audience, significant, designers, adolphus, blau, julius, hogarth, ernest, leviny, julius,

adequate, space, and, food, in, order, to, live, healthily, emus, were, formerly, subject, to, regulation, in, the, united, kingdom, under, the, dangerous, wild, animals, act, however, a, review, of, the, act, in, 2007, led, to, changes, that, allow, emus, alongside, a, number, of, other, animals, that, were, also, regulated, under, the, act, to, be, kept, without, a, license, as, they, were, no, longer, considered, to, be, dangerous, the, emu, has, a, prominent, place, in, australian, aboriginal, mythology, including, a, creation, myth, of, the, yuwaalaraay, and, other, groups, in, new,

groups, one, story, from, western, australia, holds, that, a, man, once, annoyed, a, small, bird, who, responded, by, throwing, a, boomerang, severing, the, arms, of, the, man, and, transforming, him, into, a, flightless, emu, the, kurdaitcha, man, of, central, australia, is, said, to, wear, sandals, made, of, emu, feathers, to, mask, his, footprints, many, aboriginal, language, groups, throughout,
