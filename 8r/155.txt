bark, is, the, outermost, layer, of, stems, and, roots, of, woody, plants, plants, with, bark, include, trees, woody, vines, and, shrubs, bark, refers, to, all, the, tissues, outside, the, vascular, cambium, and, is, a, nontechnical, term, it, overlays, the, wood, and, consists, of, the, inner, bark, and, the, outer, bark, the, inner, bark, which, in, older, stems, is, living, tissue, includes, the, innermost, layer, of, the, periderm, the, outer, bark, on, older, stems, includes, the, dead, tissue, on, the, surface, of, the, stems, along, with, parts, of, the, outermost, periderm, and, all, the, tissues, on, the, outer, side, of, the, periderm, the, outer, bark, on, trees, which, lies, external, to, the, living, periderm, is, also, called, the, rhytidome, products, derived, from, bark, include, bark, shingle, siding, and, wall, coverings, spices, and, other, flavorings, tanbark, for, tannin, resin, latex, medicines, poisons, various, hallucinogenic, chemicals, and, cork, bark, has, been, used, to, make, cloth, canoes, and, ropes, and, used, as, a, surface, for, paintings, and, map, making, a, number, of, plants, are, also, grown, for, their, attractive, or, interesting, bark, colorations, and, surface, textures, or, their, bark, is, used, as, landscape, mulch, the, process, of, removing, bark, is, decortication, and, a, log, or, trunk, from, which, bark, has, been, removed, is, said, to, be, decorticated, bark, is, present, only, on, woody, plants, herbaceous, plants, and, stems, of, young, plants, lack, bark, from, the, outside, to, the, inside, of, a, mature, woody, stem, the, layers, include, the, following, in, young, stems, which, lack, what, is, commonly, called, bark, the, tissues, are, from, the, outside, to, the, inside, cork, cell, walls, contain, suberin, a, waxy, substance, which, protects, the, stem, against, water, loss, the, invasion, of, insects, into, the, stem, and, prevents, infections, by, bacteria, and, fungal, spores, the, cambium, tissues, i, e, the, cork, cambium, and, the, vascular, cambium, are, the, only, parts, of, a, woody, stem, where, cell, division, occurs, undifferentiated, cells, in, the, vascular, cambium, divide, rapidly, to, produce, secondary, xylem, to, the, inside, and, secondary, phloem, to, the, outside, phloem, is, a, nutrient, conducting, tissue, composed, of, sieve, tubes, or, sieve, cells, mixed, with, parenchyma, and, fibers, the, cortex, is, the, primary, tissue, of, stems, and, roots, in, stems, the, cortex, is, between, the, epidermis, layer, and, the, phloem, in, roots, the, inner, layer, is, not, phloem, but, the, pericycle, as, the, stem, ages, and, grows, changes, occur, that, transform, the, surface, of, the, stem, into, the, bark, the, epidermis, is, a, layer, of, cells, that, cover, the, plant, body, including, the, stems, leaves, flowers, and, fruits, that, protects, the, plant, from, the, outside, world, in, old, stems, the, epidermal, layer, cortex, and, primary, phloem, become, separated, from, the, inner, tissues, by, thicker, formations, of, cork, due, to, the, thickening, cork, layer, these, cells, die, because, they, do, not, receive, water, and, nutrients, this, dead, layer, is, the, rough, corky, bark, that, forms, around, tree, trunks, and, other, stems, cork, sometimes, confused, with, bark, in, colloquial, speech, is, the, outermost, layer, of, a, woody, stem, derived, from, the, cork, cambium, it, serves, as, protection, against, damage, from, parasites, herbivorous, animals, and, diseases, as, well, as, dehydration, and, fire, often, a, secondary, covering, called, the, periderm, forms, on, small, woody, stems, and, many, non, woody, plants, which, is, composed, of, cork, phellem, the, cork, cambium, phellogen, and, the, phelloderm, the, periderm, forms, from, the, phellogen, which, serves, as, a, lateral, meristem, the, periderm, replaces, the, epidermis, and, acts, as, a, protective, covering, like, the, epidermis, mature, phellem, cells, have, suberin, in, their, walls, to, protect, the, stem, from, desiccation, and, pathogen, attack, older, phellem, cells, are, dead, as, is, the, case, with, woody, stems, the, skin, on, the, potato, tuber, which, is, an, underground, stem, constitutes, the, cork, of, the, periderm, in, woody, plants, the, epidermis, of, newly, grown, stems, is, replaced, by, the, periderm, later, in, the, year, as, the, stems, grow, a, layer, of, cells, form, under, the, epidermis, called, the, cork, cambium, these, cells, produce, cork, cells, that, turn, into, cork, a, limited, number, of, cell, layers, may, form, interior, to, the, cork, cambium, called, the, phelloderm, as, the, stem, grows, the, cork, cambium, produces, new, layers, of, cork, which, are, impermeable, to, gases, and, water, and, the, cells, outside, the, periderm, namely, the, epidermis, cortex, and, older, secondary, phloem, die, within, the, periderm, are, lenticels, which, form, during, the, production, of, the, first, periderm, layer, since, there, are, living, cells, within, the, cambium, layers, that, need, to, exchange, gases, during, metabolism, these, lenticels, because, they, have, numerous, intercellular, spaces, allow, gaseous, exchange, with, the, outside, atmosphere, as, the, bark, develops, new, lenticels, are, formed, within, the, cracks, of, the, cork, layers, the, rhytidome, is, the, most, familiar, part, of, bark, being, the, outer, layer, that, covers, the, trunks, of, trees, it, is, composed, mostly, of, dead, cells, and, is, produced, by, the, formation, of, multiple, layers, of, suberized, periderm, cortical, and, phloem, tissue, the, rhytidome, is, especially, well, developed, in, older, stems, and, roots, of, trees, in, shrubs, older, bark, is, quickly, exfoliated, and, thick, rhytidome, accumulates, it, is, generally, thickest, and, most, distinctive, at, the, trunk, or, bole, the, area, from, the, ground, to, where, the, main, branching, starts, of, the, tree, bark, tissues, make, up, by, weight, between, 10, and, 20, of, woody, vascular, plants, and, consists, of, various, biopolymers, tannins, lignin, suberin, and, polysaccharides, up, to, 40, of, the, bark, tissue, is, made, of, lignin, which, forms, an, important, part, of, a, plant, providing, structural, support, by, crosslinking, between, different, polysaccharides, such, as, cellulose, condensed, tannin, which, is, in, fairly, high, concentration, in, bark, tissue, is, thought, to, inhibit, decomposition, it, could, be, due, to, this, factor, that, the, degradation, of, lignin, is, far, less, pronounced, in, bark, tissue, than, it, is, in, wood, it, has, been, proposed, that, in, the, cork, layer, the, phellogen, suberin, acts, as, a, barrier, to, microbial, degradation, and, so, protects, the, internal, structure, of, the, plant, analysis, of, the, lignin, in, the, bark, wall, during, decay, by, the, white, rot, fungi, lentinula, edodes, shiitake, mushroom, using, 13, c, nmr, revealed, that, the, lignin, polymers, contained, more, guaiacyl, lignin, units, than, syringyl, units, compared, to, the, interior, of, the, plant, guaiacyl, units, are, less, susceptible, to, degradation, as, compared, to, syringyl, they, contain, fewer, aryl, aryl, bonds, can, form, a, condensed, lignin, structure, and, have, a, lower, redox, potential, this, could, mean, that, the, concentration, and, type, of, lignin, units, could, provide, additional, resistance, to, fungal, decay, for, plants, protected, by, bark, bark, can, sustain, damage, from, environmental, factors, such, as, frost, crack, and, sun, scald, as, well, as, biological, factors, such, as, woodpecker, and, boring, beetle, attacks, male, deer, and, other, male, members, of, the, cervidae, deer, family, can, cause, extensive, bark, damage, during, the, rutting, season, by, rubbing, their, antlers, against, the, tree, to, remove, their, velvet, the, bark, is, often, damaged, by, being, bound, to, stakes, or, wrapped, with, wires, in, the, past, this, damage, was, called, bark, galling, and, was, treated, by, applying, clay, laid, on, the, galled, place, and, binding, it, up, with, hay, in, modern, usage, galling, most, typically, refers, to, a, type, of, abnormal, growth, on, a, plant, caused, by, insects, or, pathogens, bark, damage, can, have, several, detrimental, effects, on, the, plant, bark, serves, as, a, physical, barrier, to, disease, pressure, especially, from, fungi, so, its, removal, makes, the, plant, more, susceptible, to, disease, damage, or, destruction, of, the, phloem, impedes, the, transport, of, photosynthetic, products, throughout, the, plant, in, extreme, cases, when, a, band, of, phloem, all, the, way, around, the, stem, is, removed, the, plant, will, usually, quickly, die, bark, damage, in, horticultural, applications, as, in, gardening, and, public, landscaping, results, in, often, unwanted, aesthetic, damage, the, degree, to, which, woody, plants, are, able, to, repair, gross, physical, damage, to, their, bark, is, quite, variable, across, species, and, type, of, damage, some, are, able, to, produce, a, callus, growth, which, heals, over, the, wound, rapidly, but, leaves, a, clear, scar, whilst, others, such, as, oaks, do, not, produce, an, extensive, callus, repair, sap, is, sometimes, produced, to, seal, the, damaged, area, against, disease, and, insect, intrusion, a, number, of, living, organisms, live, in, or, on, bark, including, insects, fungi, and, other, plants, like, mosses, algae, and, other, vascular, plants, many, of, these, organisms, are, pathogens, or, parasites, but, some, also, have, symbiotic, relationships, the, inner, bark, phloem, of, some, trees, is, edible, in, hunter, gatherer, societies, and, in, times, of, famine, it, is, harvested, and, used, as, a, food, source, in, scandinavia, bark, bread, is, made, from, rye, to, which, the, toasted, and, ground, innermost, layer, of, bark, of, scots, pine, or, birch, is, added, the, sami, people, of, far, northern, europe, use, large, sheets, of, pinus, sylvestris, bark, that, are, removed, in, the, spring, prepared, and, stored, for, use, as, a, staple, food, resource, the, inner, bark, is, eaten, fresh, dried, or, roasted, bark, can, be, used, as, a, construction, material, and, was, used, widely, in, pre, industrial, societies, some, barks, particularly, birch, bark, can, be, removed, in, long, sheets, and, other, mechanically, cohesive, structures, allowing, the, bark, to, be, used, in, the, construction, of, canoes, as, the, drainage, layer, in, roofs, for, shoes, backpacks, and, other, useful, items, bark, was, also, used, as, a, construction, material, in, settler, colonial, societies, particularly, australia, both, as, exterior, wall, cladding, and, as, a, roofing, material, in, the, cork, oak, quercus, suber, the, bark, is, thick, enough, to, be, harvested, as, a, cork, product, without, killing, the, tree, in, this, species, the, bark, may, get, very, thick, e, g, more, than, 20, cm, has, been, reported, some, stem, bark, s, have, significantly, different, phytochemical, content, from, other, parts, some, of, these, phytochemicals, have, pesticidal, culinary, or, medicinally, and, culturally, important, ethnopharmacological, properties, bark, contains, strong, fibres, known, as, bast, and, there, is, a, long, tradition, in, northern, europe, of, using, bark, from, coppiced, young, branches, of, the, small, leaved, lime, tilia, cordata, to, produce, cordage, and, rope, used, for, example, in, the, rigging, of, viking, age, longships, among, the, commercial, products, made, from, bark, are, cork, cinnamon, quinine, from, the, bark, of, cinchona, and, aspirin, from, the, bark, of, willow, trees, the, bark, of, some, trees, notably, oak, quercus, robur, is, a, source, of, tannic, acid, which, is, used, in, tanning, bark, chips, generated, as, a, by, product, of, lumber, production, are, often, used, in, bark, mulch, bark, is, important, to, the, horticultural, industry, since, in, shredded, form, it, is, used, for, plants, that, do, not, thrive, in, ordinary, soil, such, as, epiphytes, wood, bark, contains, lignin, which, when, pyrolyzed, yields, a, liquid, bio, oil, product, rich, in, natural, phenol, derivatives, these, are, used, as, a, replacement, for, fossil, based, phenols, in, phenol, formaldehyde, pf, resins, used, in, oriented, strand, board, osb, and, plywood
