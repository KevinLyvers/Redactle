carotenoids, k, r, t, n, d, are, yellow, orange, and, red, organic, pigments, that, are, produced, by, plants, and, algae, as, well, as, several, bacteria, archaea, and, fungi, carotenoids, give, the, characteristic, color, to, pumpkins, carrots, parsnips, corn, tomatoes, canaries, flamingos, salmon, lobster, shrimp, and, daffodils, over, 1, 100, identified, carotenoids, can, be, further, categorized, into, two, classes, xanthophylls, which, contain, oxygen, and, carotenes, which, are, purely, hydrocarbons, and, contain, no, oxygen, all, are, derivatives, of, tetraterpenes, meaning, that, they, are, produced, from, 8, isoprene, units, and, contain, 40, carbon, atoms, in, general, carotenoids, absorb, wavelengths, ranging, from, 400, to, 550, nanometers, violet, to, green, light, this, causes, the, compounds, to, be, deeply, colored, yellow, orange, or, red, carotenoids, are, the, dominant, pigment, in, autumn, leaf, coloration, of, about, 15, 30, of, tree, species, but, many, plant, colors, especially, reds, and, purples, are, due, to, polyphenols, carotenoids, serve, two, key, roles, in, plants, and, algae, they, absorb, light, energy, for, use, in, photosynthesis, and, they, provide, photoprotection, via, non, photochemical, quenching, carotenoids, that, contain, unsubstituted, beta, ionone, rings, including, carotene, carotene, cryptoxanthin, and, carotene, have, vitamin, a, activity, meaning, that, they, can, be, converted, to, retinol, in, the, eye, lutein, meso, zeaxanthin, and, zeaxanthin, are, present, as, macular, pigments, whose, importance, in, visual, function, as, of, 2016, remains, under, clinical, research, carotenoids, are, produced, by, all, photosynthetic, organisms, and, are, primarily, used, as, accessory, pigments, to, chlorophyll, in, the, light, harvesting, part, of, photosynthesis, they, are, highly, unsaturated, with, conjugated, double, bonds, which, enables, carotenoids, to, absorb, light, of, various, wavelengths, at, the, same, time, the, terminal, groups, regulate, the, polarity, and, properties, within, lipid, membranes, most, carotenoids, are, tetraterpenoids, regular, c, 40, displaystyle, ce, c40, isoprenoids, several, modifications, to, these, structures, exist, including, cyclization, varying, degrees, of, saturation, or, unsaturation, and, other, functional, groups, carotenes, typically, contain, only, carbon, and, hydrogen, i, e, they, are, hydrocarbons, prominent, members, include, carotene, carotene, and, lycopene, are, known, as, carotenes, carotenoids, containing, oxygen, include, lutein, and, zeaxanthin, they, are, known, as, xanthophylls, their, color, ranging, from, pale, yellow, through, bright, orange, to, deep, red, is, directly, related, to, their, structure, especially, the, length, of, the, conjugation, xanthophylls, are, often, yellow, giving, their, class, name, carotenoids, also, participate, in, different, types, of, cell, signaling, they, are, able, to, signal, the, production, of, abscisic, acid, which, regulates, plant, growth, seed, dormancy, embryo, maturation, and, germination, cell, division, and, elongation, floral, growth, and, stress, responses, the, length, of, the, multiple, conjugated, double, bonds, determines, their, color, and, photophysics, after, absorbing, a, photon, the, carotenoid, transfers, its, excited, electron, to, chlorophyll, for, use, in, photosynthesis, upon, absorption, of, light, carotenoids, transfer, excitation, energy, to, and, from, chlorophyll, the, singlet, singlet, energy, transfer, is, a, lower, energy, state, transfer, and, is, used, during, photosynthesis, the, triplet, triplet, transfer, is, a, higher, energy, state, and, is, essential, in, photoprotection, light, produces, damaging, species, during, photosynthesis, with, the, most, damaging, being, reactive, oxygen, species, ros, as, these, high, energy, ros, are, produced, in, the, chlorophyll, the, energy, is, transferred, to, the, carotenoid, s, polyene, tail, and, undergoes, a, series, of, reactions, in, which, electrons, are, moved, between, the, carotenoid, bonds, in, order, to, find, the, most, balanced, lowest, energy, state, for, the, carotenoid, carotenoids, defend, plants, against, singlet, oxygen, by, both, energy, transfer, and, by, chemical, reactions, they, also, protect, plants, by, quenching, triplet, chlorophyll, by, protecting, lipids, from, free, radical, damage, which, generate, charged, lipid, peroxides, and, other, oxidised, derivatives, carotenoids, support, crystalline, architecture, and, hydrophobicity, of, lipoproteins, and, cellular, lipid, structures, hence, oxygen, solubility, and, its, diffusion, therein, like, some, fatty, acids, carotenoids, are, lipophilic, due, to, the, presence, of, long, unsaturated, aliphatic, chains, as, a, consequence, carotenoids, are, typically, present, in, plasma, lipoproteins, and, cellular, lipid, structures, carotenoids, are, located, primarily, outside, the, cell, nucleus, in, different, cytoplasm, organelles, lipid, droplets, cytosomes, and, granules, they, have, been, visualised, and, quantified, by, raman, spectroscopy, in, an, algal, cell, with, the, development, of, monoclonal, antibodies, to, trans, lycopene, it, was, possible, to, localise, this, carotenoid, in, different, animal, and, human, cells, beta, carotene, found, in, pumpkins, sweet, potato, carrots, and, winter, squash, is, responsible, for, their, orange, yellow, colors, dried, carrots, have, the, highest, amount, of, carotene, of, any, food, per, 100, gram, serving, measured, in, retinol, activity, equivalents, provitamin, a, equivalents, vietnamese, gac, fruit, contains, the, highest, known, concentration, of, the, carotenoid, lycopene, although, green, kale, spinach, collard, greens, and, turnip, greens, contain, substantial, amounts, of, beta, carotene, the, diet, of, flamingos, is, rich, in, carotenoids, imparting, the, orange, colored, feathers, of, these, birds, reviews, of, preliminary, research, in, 2015, indicated, that, foods, high, in, carotenoids, may, reduce, the, risk, of, head, and, neck, cancers, and, prostate, cancer, there, is, no, correlation, between, consumption, of, foods, high, in, carotenoids, and, vitamin, a, and, the, risk, of, parkinson, s, disease, humans, and, other, animals, are, mostly, incapable, of, synthesizing, carotenoids, and, must, obtain, them, through, their, diet, carotenoids, are, a, common, and, often, ornamental, feature, in, animals, for, example, the, pink, color, of, salmon, and, the, red, coloring, of, cooked, lobsters, and, scales, of, the, yellow, morph, of, common, wall, lizards, are, due, to, carotenoids, it, has, been, proposed, that, carotenoids, are, used, in, ornamental, traits, for, extreme, examples, see, puffin, birds, because, given, their, physiological, and, chemical, properties, they, can, be, used, as, visible, indicators, of, individual, health, and, hence, are, used, by, animals, when, selecting, potential, mates, carotenoids, from, the, diet, are, stored, in, the, fatty, tissues, of, animals, and, exclusively, carnivorous, animals, obtain, the, compounds, from, animal, fat, in, the, human, diet, absorption, of, carotenoids, is, improved, when, consumed, with, fat, in, a, meal, cooking, carotenoid, containing, vegetables, in, oil, and, shredding, the, vegetable, both, increase, carotenoid, bioavailability, the, most, common, carotenoids, include, lycopene, and, the, vitamin, a, precursor, carotene, in, plants, the, xanthophyll, lutein, is, the, most, abundant, carotenoid, and, its, role, in, preventing, age, related, eye, disease, is, currently, under, investigation, lutein, and, the, other, carotenoid, pigments, found, in, mature, leaves, are, often, not, obvious, because, of, the, masking, presence, of, chlorophyll, when, chlorophyll, is, not, present, as, in, autumn, foliage, the, yellows, and, oranges, of, the, carotenoids, are, predominant, for, the, same, reason, carotenoid, colors, often, predominate, in, ripe, fruit, after, being, unmasked, by, the, disappearance, of, chlorophyll, carotenoids, are, responsible, for, the, brilliant, yellows, and, oranges, that, tint, deciduous, foliage, such, as, dying, autumn, leaves, of, certain, hardwood, species, as, hickories, ash, maple, yellow, poplar, aspen, birch, black, cherry, sycamore, cottonwood, sassafras, and, alder, carotenoids, are, the, dominant, pigment, in, autumn, leaf, coloration, of, about, 15, 30, of, tree, species, however, the, reds, the, purples, and, their, blended, combinations, that, decorate, autumn, foliage, usually, come, from, another, group, of, pigments, in, the, cells, called, anthocyanins, unlike, the, carotenoids, these, pigments, are, not, present, in, the, leaf, throughout, the, growing, season, but, are, actively, produced, towards, the, end, of, summer, dietary, carotenoids, and, their, metabolic, derivatives, are, responsible, for, bright, yellow, to, red, coloration, in, birds, studies, estimate, that, around, 2956, modern, bird, species, display, carotenoid, coloration, and, that, the, ability, to, utilize, these, pigments, for, external, coloration, has, evolved, independently, many, times, throughout, avian, evolutionary, history, carotenoid, coloration, exhibits, high, levels, of, sexual, dimorphism, with, adult, male, birds, generally, displaying, more, vibrant, coloration, than, females, of, the, same, species, these, differences, arise, due, to, the, selection, of, yellow, and, red, coloration, in, males, by, female, preference, in, many, species, of, birds, females, invest, greater, time, and, resources, into, raising, offspring, than, their, male, partners, therefore, it, is, imperative, that, female, birds, carefully, select, high, quality, mates, current, literature, supports, the, theory, that, vibrant, carotenoid, coloration, is, correlated, with, male, quality, either, though, direct, effects, on, immune, function, and, oxidative, stress, or, through, a, connection, between, carotenoid, metabolizing, pathways, and, pathways, for, cellular, respiration, it, is, generally, considered, that, sexually, selected, traits, such, as, carotenoid, based, coloration, evolve, because, they, are, honest, signals, of, phenotypic, and, genetic, quality, for, instance, among, males, of, the, bird, species, parus, major, the, more, colorfully, ornamented, males, produce, sperm, that, is, better, protected, against, oxidative, stress, due, to, increased, presence, of, carotenoid, antioxidants, however, there, is, also, evidence, that, attractive, male, coloration, may, be, a, faulty, signal, of, male, quality, among, stickleback, fish, males, that, are, more, attractive, to, females, due, to, carotenoid, colorants, appear, to, under, allocate, carotenoids, to, their, germline, cells, since, carotinoids, are, beneficial, antioxidants, their, under, allocation, to, germline, cells, can, lead, to, increased, oxidative, dna, damage, to, these, cells, therefore, female, sticklebacks, may, risk, fertility, and, the, viability, of, their, offspring, by, choosing, redder, but, more, deteriorated, partners, with, reduced, sperm, quality, products, of, carotenoid, degradation, such, as, ionones, damascones, and, damascenones, are, also, important, fragrance, chemicals, that, are, used, extensively, in, the, perfumes, and, fragrance, industry, both, damascenone, and, ionone, although, low, in, concentration, in, rose, distillates, are, the, key, odor, contributing, compounds, in, flowers, in, fact, the, sweet, floral, smells, present, in, black, tea, aged, tobacco, grape, and, many, fruits, are, due, to, the, aromatic, compounds, resulting, from, carotenoid, breakdown, some, carotenoids, are, produced, by, bacteria, to, protect, themselves, from, oxidative, immune, attack, the, aureus, golden, pigment, that, gives, some, strains, of, staphylococcus, aureus, their, name, is, a, carotenoid, called, staphyloxanthin, this, carotenoid, is, a, virulence, factor, with, an, antioxidant, action, that, helps, the, microbe, evade, death, by, reactive, oxygen, species, used, by, the, host, immune, system, the, basic, building, blocks, of, carotenoids, are, isopentenyl, diphosphate, ipp, and, dimethylallyl, diphosphate, dmapp, these, two, isoprene, isomers, are, used, to, create, various, compounds, depending, on, the, biological, pathway, used, to, synthesize, the, isomers, plants, are, known, to, use, two, different, pathways, for, ipp, production, the, cytosolic, mevalonic, acid, pathway, mva, and, the, plastidic, methylerythritol, 4, phosphate, mep, in, animals, the, production, of, cholesterol, starts, by, creating, ipp, and, dmapp, using, the, mva, for, carotenoid, production, plants, use, mep, to, generate, ipp, and, dmapp, the, mep, pathway, results, in, a, 5, 1, mixture, of, ipp, dmapp, ipp, and, dmapp, undergo, several, reactions, resulting, in, the, major, carotenoid, precursor, geranylgeranyl, diphosphate, ggpp, ggpp, can, be, converted, into, carotenes, or, xanthophylls, by, undergoing, a, number, of, different, steps, within, the, carotenoid, biosynthetic, pathway, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, and, pyruvate, intermediates, of, photosynthesis, are, converted, to, deoxy, d, xylulose, 5, phosphate, dxp, catalyzed, by, dxp, synthase, dxs, dxp, reductoisomerase, catalyzes, the, reduction, by, nadph, and, subsequent, rearrangement, the, resulting, mep, is, converted, to, 4, cytidine, 5, diphospho, 2, c, methyl, d, erythritol, cdp, me, in, the, presence, of, ctp, using, the, enzyme, mep, cytidylyltransferase, cdp, me, is, then, converted, in, the, presence, of, atp, to, 2, phospho, 4, cytidine, 5, diphospho, 2, c, methyl, d, erythritol, cdp, me2p, the, conversion, to, cdp, me2p, is, catalyzed, by, cdp, me, kinase, next, cdp, me2p, is, converted, to, 2, c, methyl, d, erythritol, 2, 4, cyclodiphosphate, mecdp, this, reaction, occurs, when, mecdp, synthase, catalyzes, the, reaction, and, cmp, is, eliminated, from, the, cdp, me2p, molecule, mecdp, is, then, converted, to, e, 4, hydroxy, 3, methylbut, 2, en, 1, yl, diphosphate, hmbdp, via, hmbdp, synthase, in, the, presence, of, flavodoxin, and, nadph, hmbdp, is, reduced, to, ipp, in, the, presence, of, ferredoxin, and, nadph, by, the, enzyme, hmbdp, reductase, the, last, two, steps, involving, hmbpd, synthase, and, reductase, can, only, occur, in, completely, anaerobic, environments, ipp, is, then, able, to, isomerize, to, dmapp, via, ipp, isomerase, two, ggpp, molecules, condense, via, phytoene, synthase, psy, forming, the, 15, cis, isomer, of, phytoene, psy, belongs, to, the, squalene, phytoene, synthase, family, and, is, homologous, to, squalene, synthase, that, takes, part, in, steroid, biosynthesis, the, subsequent, conversion, of, phytoene, into, all, trans, lycopene, depends, on, the, organism, bacteria, and, fungi, employ, a, single, enzyme, the, bacterial, phytoene, desaturase, crti, for, the, catalysis, plants, and, cyanobacteria, however, utilize, four, enzymes, for, this, process, the, first, of, these, enzymes, is, a, plant, type, phytoene, desaturase, which, introduces, two, additional, double, bonds, into, 15, cis, phytoene, by, dehydrogenation, and, isomerizes, two, of, its, existing, double, bonds, from, trans, to, cis, producing, 9, 15, 9, tri, cis, carotene, the, central, double, bond, of, this, tri, cis, carotene, is, isomerized, by, the, zeta, carotene, isomerase, z, iso, and, the, resulting, 9, 9, di, cis, carotene, is, dehydrogenated, again, via, a, carotene, desaturase, zds, this, again, introduces, two, double, bonds, resulting, in, 7, 9, 7, 9, tetra, cis, lycopene, crtiso, a, carotenoid, isomerase, is, needed, to, convert, the, cis, lycopene, into, an, all, trans, lycopene, in, the, presence, of, reduced, fad, this, all, trans, lycopene, is, cyclized, cyclization, gives, rise, to, carotenoid, diversity, which, can, be, distinguished, based, on, the, end, groups, there, can, be, either, a, beta, ring, or, an, epsilon, ring, each, generated, by, a, different, enzyme, lycopene, beta, cyclase, or, lycopene, epsilon, cyclase, carotene, is, produced, when, the, all, trans, lycopene, first, undergoes, reaction, with, epsilon, lcy, then, a, second, reaction, with, beta, lcy, whereas, carotene, is, produced, by, two, reactions, with, beta, lcy, and, carotene, are, the, most, common, carotenoids, in, the, plant, photosystems, but, they, can, still, be, further, converted, into, xanthophylls, by, using, beta, hydrolase, and, epsilon, hydrolase, leading, to, a, variety, of, xanthophylls, it, is, believed, that, both, dxs, and, dxr, are, rate, determining, enzymes, allowing, them, to, regulate, carotenoid, levels, this, was, discovered, in, an, experiment, where, dxs, and, dxr, were, genetically, overexpressed, leading, to, increased, carotenoid, expression, in, the, resulting, seedlings, also, j, protein, j20, and, heat, shock, protein, 70, hsp70, chaperones, are, thought, to, be, involved, in, post, transcriptional, regulation, of, dxs, activity, such, that, mutants, with, defective, j20, activity, exhibit, reduced, dxs, enzyme, activity, while, accumulating, inactive, dxs, protein, regulation, may, also, be, caused, by, external, toxins, that, affect, enzymes, and, proteins, required, for, synthesis, ketoclomazone, is, derived, from, herbicides, applied, to, soil, and, binds, to, dxp, synthase, this, inhibits, dxp, synthase, preventing, synthesis, of, dxp, and, halting, the, mep, pathway, the, use, of, this, toxin, leads, to, lower, levels, of, carotenoids, in, plants, grown, in, the, contaminated, soil, fosmidomycin, an, antibiotic, is, a, competitive, inhibitor, of, dxp, reductoisomerase, due, to, its, similar, structure, to, the, enzyme, application, of, said, antibiotic, prevents, reduction, of, dxp, again, halting, the, mep, pathway
