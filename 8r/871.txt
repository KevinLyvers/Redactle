the, muridae, or, murids, are, either, the, largest, or, second, largest, family, of, rodents, and, of, mammals, containing, approximately, 870, species, including, many, species, of, mice, rats, and, gerbils, found, naturally, throughout, eurasia, africa, and, australia, the, name, muridae, comes, from, the, latin, mus, genitive, muris, meaning, mouse, since, all, true, mice, belong, to, the, family, with, the, more, typical, mice, belonging, to, the, genus, mus, murids, are, found, nearly, everywhere, in, the, world, though, many, subfamilies, have, narrower, ranges, murids, are, not, found, in, antarctica, or, many, oceanic, islands, although, none, of, them, are, native, to, the, americas, a, few, species, notably, the, house, mouse, and, black, rat, have, been, introduced, worldwide, murids, occupy, a, broad, range, of, ecosystems, from, tropical, forests, to, tundras, fossorial, arboreal, and, semiaquatic, murid, species, occur, though, most, are, terrestrial, animals, the, extensive, list, of, niches, filled, by, murids, helps, to, explain, their, relative, abundance, a, broad, range, of, feeding, habits, is, found, in, murids, ranging, from, herbivorous, and, omnivorous, species, to, specialists, that, consume, strictly, earthworms, certain, species, of, fungi, or, aquatic, insects, most, genera, consume, plant, matter, and, small, invertebrates, often, storing, seeds, and, other, plant, matter, for, winter, consumption, murids, have, sciurognathous, jaws, an, ancestral, character, in, rodents, and, a, diastema, is, present, murids, lack, canines, and, premolars, generally, three, molars, though, sometimes, only, one, or, two, are, found, and, the, nature, of, the, molars, varies, by, genus, and, feeding, habit, some, murids, are, highly, social, while, others, are, solitary, females, commonly, produce, several, litters, annually, in, warm, regions, breeding, may, occur, year, round, though, the, lifespans, of, most, genera, are, generally, less, than, two, years, murids, have, high, reproductive, potential, and, their, populations, tend, to, increase, rapidly, and, then, drastically, decline, when, food, resources, have, been, exhausted, this, is, often, seen, in, a, three, to, four, year, cycle, the, murids, are, small, mammals, typically, around, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, long, excluding, the, tail, but, ranging, from, 4, 5, to, 8, cm, 1, 8, to, 3, 1, in, in, the, african, pygmy, mouse, to, 50, cm, 20, in, in, the, northern, luzon, giant, cloud, rat, they, typically, have, slender, bodies, with, scaled, tails, longer, than, the, body, and, pointed, snouts, with, prominent, whiskers, but, with, wide, variation, in, these, broad, traits, some, murids, have, elongated, legs, and, feet, to, allow, them, to, move, with, a, hopping, motion, while, others, have, broad, feet, and, prehensile, tails, to, improve, their, climbing, ability, and, yet, others, have, neither, adaptation, they, are, most, commonly, some, shade, of, brown, in, color, although, many, have, black, grey, or, white, markings, murids, generally, have, excellent, senses, of, hearing, and, smell, they, live, in, a, wide, range, of, habitats, from, forest, to, grassland, and, mountain, ranges, a, number, of, species, especially, the, gerbils, are, adapted, to, desert, conditions, and, can, survive, for, a, long, time, with, minimal, water, they, consume, a, wide, range, of, foods, depending, on, the, species, with, the, aid, of, powerful, jaw, muscles, and, gnawing, incisors, that, grow, throughout, life, the, dental, formula, of, murids, is, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3, murids, breed, frequently, often, producing, large, litters, several, times, per, year, they, typically, give, birth, between, twenty, and, forty, days, after, mating, although, this, varies, greatly, between, species, the, young, are, typically, born, blind, hairless, and, helpless, although, exceptions, occur, such, as, in, spiny, mice, as, with, many, other, small, mammals, the, evolution, of, the, murids, is, not, well, known, as, few, fossils, survive, they, probably, evolved, from, hamster, like, animals, in, tropical, asia, some, time, in, the, early, miocene, and, have, only, subsequently, produced, species, capable, of, surviving, in, cooler, climates, they, have, become, especially, common, worldwide, during, the, current, geological, epoch, as, a, result, of, hitching, a, ride, commensally, with, human, migrations, the, murids, are, classified, in, five, subfamilies, around, 150, genera, and, about, 834, species, murids, feature, in, literature, including, folk, tales, and, fairy, stories, in, the, pied, piper, of, hamelin, retold, in, many, versions, since, the, 14th, century, including, one, by, the, brothers, grimm, a, rat, catcher, lures, the, town, s, rats, into, the, river, but, the, mayor, refuses, to, pay, him, in, revenge, the, rat, catcher, lures, away, all, the, children, of, the, town, never, to, return, mice, feature, in, some, of, beatrix, potter, s, small, books, including, the, tale, of, two, bad, mice, 1904, the, tale, of, mrs, tittlemouse, 1910, the, tale, of, johnny, town, mouse, 1918, and, the, tailor, of, gloucester, 1903, which, last, was, described, by, j, r, r, tolkien, as, perhaps, the, nearest, to, his, idea, of, a, fairy, story, the, rest, being, beast, fables, among, aesop, s, fables, are, the, cat, and, the, mice, and, the, frog, and, the, mouse, in, james, herbert, s, first, novel, the, rats, 1974, a, vagrant, is, attacked, and, eaten, alive, by, a, pack,
