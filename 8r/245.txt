a, larva, l, r, v, pl, larvae, l, r, v, i, is, a, distinct, juvenile, form, many, animals, undergo, before, metamorphosis, into, their, next, life, stage, animals, with, indirect, development, such, as, insects, amphibians, or, cnidarians, typically, have, a, larval, phase, of, their, life, cycle, a, larva, s, appearance, is, generally, very, different, from, the, adult, form, e, g, caterpillars, and, butterflies, including, different, unique, structures, and, organs, that, do, not, occur, in, the, adult, form, their, diet, may, also, be, considerably, different, larvae, are, frequently, adapted, to, different, environments, than, adults, for, example, some, larvae, such, as, tadpoles, live, almost, exclusively, in, aquatic, environments, but, can, live, outside, water, as, adult, frogs, by, living, in, a, distinct, environment, larvae, may, be, given, shelter, from, predators, and, reduce, competition, for, resources, with, the, adult, population, animals, in, the, larval, stage, will, consume, food, to, fuel, their, transition, into, the, adult, form, in, some, organisms, like, polychaetes, and, barnacles, adults, are, immobile, but, their, larvae, are, mobile, and, use, their, mobile, larval, form, to, distribute, themselves, these, larvae, used, for, dispersal, are, either, planktotrophic, feeding, or, lecithotrophic, non, feeding, some, larvae, are, dependent, on, adults, to, feed, them, in, many, eusocial, hymenoptera, species, the, larvae, are, fed, by, female, workers, in, ropalidia, marginata, a, paper, wasp, the, males, are, also, capable, of, feeding, larvae, but, they, are, much, less, efficient, spending, more, time, and, getting, less, food, to, the, larvae, the, larvae, of, some, organisms, for, example, some, newts, can, become, pubescent, and, do, not, develop, further, into, the, adult, form, this, is, a, type, of, neoteny, it, is, a, misunderstanding, that, the, larval, form, always, reflects, the, group, s, evolutionary, history, this, could, be, the, case, but, often, the, larval, stage, has, evolved, secondarily, as, in, insects, in, these, cases, the, larval, form, may, differ, more, than, the, adult, form, from, the, group, s, common, origin, within, insects, only, endopterygotes, show, complete, metamorphosis, including, a, distinct, larval, stage, several, classifications, have, been, suggested, by, many, entomologists, and, following, classification, is, based, on, antonio, berlese, classification, in, 1913, there, are, four, main, types, of, endopterygote, larvae, types
