the, term, carp, pl, carp, is, a, generic, common, name, for, numerous, species, of, freshwater, fish, from, the, family, cyprinidae, a, very, large, clade, of, ray, finned, fish, mostly, native, to, eurasia, while, carp, are, prized, quarries, and, are, valued, even, commercially, cultivated, as, both, food, and, ornamental, fish, in, many, parts, of, the, old, world, they, are, considered, trash, fish, and, invasive, pests, in, many, parts, of, africa, australia, and, most, of, the, united, states, the, cypriniformes, family, cyprinidae, are, traditionally, grouped, with, the, characiformes, siluriformes, and, gymnotiformes, to, create, the, superorder, ostariophysi, since, these, groups, share, some, common, features, these, features, include, being, found, predominantly, in, fresh, water, and, possessing, weberian, ossicles, an, anatomical, structure, derived, from, the, first, five, anterior, most, vertebrae, and, their, corresponding, ribs, and, neural, crests, the, third, anterior, most, pair, of, ribs, is, in, contact, with, the, extension, of, the, labyrinth, and, the, posterior, with, the, swim, bladder, the, function, is, poorly, understood, but, this, structure, is, presumed, to, take, part, in, the, transmission, of, vibrations, from, the, swim, bladder, to, the, labyrinth, and, in, the, perception, of, sound, which, would, explain, why, the, ostariophysi, have, such, a, great, capacity, for, hearing, most, cypriniformes, have, scales, and, teeth, on, the, inferior, pharyngeal, bones, which, may, be, modified, in, relation, to, the, diet, tribolodon, is, the, only, cyprinid, genus, which, tolerates, salt, water, several, species, move, into, brackish, water, but, return, to, fresh, water, to, spawn, all, of, the, other, cypriniformes, live, in, continental, waters, and, have, a, wide, geographical, range, some, consider, all, cyprinid, fishes, carp, and, the, family, cyprinidae, itself, is, often, known, as, the, carp, family, in, colloquial, use, carp, usually, refers, only, to, several, larger, cyprinid, species, such, as, cyprinus, carpio, common, carp, carassius, carassius, crucian, carp, ctenopharyngodon, idella, grass, carp, hypophthalmichthys, molitrix, silver, carp, and, hypophthalmichthys, nobilis, bighead, carp, common, carp, are, native, to, both, eastern, europe, and, western, asia, so, they, are, sometimes, called, a, eurasian, carp, carp, have, long, been, an, important, food, fish, to, humans, several, species, such, as, the, various, goldfish, carassius, auratus, breeds, and, the, domesticated, common, carp, variety, known, as, koi, cyprinus, rubrofuscus, var, koi, have, been, popular, ornamental, fishes, as, a, result, carp, have, been, introduced, to, various, locations, though, with, mixed, results, several, species, of, carp, are, considered, invasive, species, in, the, united, states, and, worldwide, large, sums, of, money, are, spent, on, carp, control, at, least, some, species, of, carp, are, able, to, survive, for, months, with, practically, no, oxygen, for, example, under, ice, or, in, stagnant, scummy, water, by, metabolizing, glycogen, to, form, lactic, acid, which, is, then, converted, into, ethanol, and, carbon, dioxide, the, ethanol, diffuses, into, the, surrounding, water, through, the, gills, in, 1653, izaak, walton, wrote, in, the, compleat, angler, the, carp, is, the, queen, of, rivers, a, stately, a, good, and, a, very, subtle, fish, that, was, not, at, first, bred, nor, hath, been, long, in, england, but, is, now, naturalised, carp, are, variable, in, terms, of, angling, value, various, species, of, carp, have, been, domesticated, and, reared, as, food, fish, across, europe, and, asia, for, thousands, of, years, these, various, species, appear, to, have, been, domesticated, independently, as, the, various, domesticated, carp, species, are, native, to, different, parts, of, eurasia, aquaculture, has, been, pursued, in, china, for, at, least, 2, 400, years, a, tract, by, fan, li, in, the, fifth, century, bc, details, many, of, the, ways, carp, were, raised, in, ponds, the, common, carp, cyprinus, carpio, is, originally, from, central, europe, several, carp, species, collectively, known, as, asian, carp, were, domesticated, in, east, asia, carp, that, are, originally, from, south, asia, for, example, catla, gibelion, catla, rohu, labeo, rohita, and, mrigal, cirrhinus, cirrhosus, are, known, as, indian, carp, their, hardiness, and, adaptability, have, allowed, domesticated, species, to, be, propagated, all, around, the, world, although, the, carp, was, an, important, aquatic, food, item, as, more, fish, species, have, become, readily, available, for, the, table, the, importance, of, carp, culture, in, western, europe, has, diminished, demand, has, declined, partly, due, to, the, appearance, of, more, desirable, table, fish, such, as, trout, and, salmon, through, intensive, farming, and, environmental, constraints, however, fish, production, in, ponds, is, still, a, major, form, of, aquaculture, in, central, and, eastern, europe, including, the, russian, federation, where, most, of, the, production, comes, from, low, or, intermediate, intensity, ponds, in, asia, the, farming, of, carp, continues, to, surpass, the, total, amount, of, farmed, fish, volume, of, intensively, sea, farmed, species, such, as, salmon, and, tuna, selective, breeding, programs, for, the, common, carp, include, improvement, in, growth, shape, and, resistance, to, disease, experiments, carried, out, in, the, ussr, used, crossings, of, broodstocks, to, increase, genetic, diversity, and, then, selected, the, species, for, traits, such, as, growth, rate, exterior, traits, and, viability, and, or, adaptation, to, environmental, conditions, such, as, variations, in, temperature, selected, carp, for, fast, growth, and, tolerance, to, cold, the, ropsha, carp, the, results, showed, a, 30, to, 77, 4, improvement, of, cold, tolerance, but, did, not, provide, any, data, for, growth, rate, an, increase, in, growth, rate, was, observed, in, the, second, generation, in, vietnam, moav, and, wohlfarth, 1976, showed, positive, results, when, selecting, for, slower, growth, for, three, generations, compared, to, selecting, for, faster, growth, schaperclaus, 1962, showed, resistance, to, the, dropsy, disease, wherein, selected, lines, suffered, low, mortality, 11, 5, compared, to, unselected, 57, the, major, carp, species, used, traditionally, in, chinese, aquaculture, are, the, black, grass, silver, and, bighead, carp, in, the, 1950s, the, pearl, river, fishery, research, institute, in, china, made, a, technological, breakthrough, in, the, induced, breeding, of, these, carps, which, has, resulted, in, a, rapid, expansion, of, freshwater, aquaculture, in, china, in, the, late, 1990s, scientists, at, the, chinese, academy, of, fishery, sciences, developed, a, new, variant, of, the, common, carp, called, the, jian, carp, cyprinus, carpio, var, jian, this, fish, grows, rapidly, and, has, a, high, feed, conversion, rate, over, 50, of, the, total, aquaculture, production, of, carp, in, china, has, now, converted, to, jian, carp, carp, along, with, many, of, their, cyprinid, relatives, are, popular, ornamental, aquarium, and, pond, fish, ornamental, goldfish, were, originally, domesticated, from, their, wild, form, a, dark, greyish, brown, carp, native, to, asia, but, may, have, been, influenced, by, carassius, carassius, and, carassius, gibelio, they, were, first, bred, for, color, in, china, over, a, thousand, years, ago, due, to, selective, breeding, goldfish, have, been, developed, into, many, distinct, breeds, and, are, found, in, various, colors, color, patterns, forms, and, sizes, far, different, from, those, of, the, original, carp, goldfish, were, kept, as, ornamental, fish, in, china, for, thousands, of, years, before, being, introduced, to, japan, in, 1603, and, to, europe, in, 1611, nishikigoi, better, known, simply, as, koi, are, a, domesticated, varieties, of, common, carp, and, amur, carp, cyprinus, rubrofuscus, that, have, been, selectively, bred, for, color, the, common, carp, was, introduced, from, china, to, japan, where, selective, breeding, in, the, 1820s, in, the, niigata, region, resulted, in, koi, in, japanese, culture, koi, are, treated, with, affection, and, seen, as, good, luck, they, are, popular, in, other, parts, of, the, world, as, outdoor, pond, fish, a, long, tradition, of, common, carp, exists, in, chinese, culture, and,
