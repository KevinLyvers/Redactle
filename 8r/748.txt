smilodon, is, an, extinct, genus, of, felids, it, is, one, of, the, best, known, saber, toothed, predators, and, prehistoric, mammals, although, commonly, known, as, the, saber, toothed, tiger, it, was, not, closely, related, to, the, tiger, or, other, modern, cats, belonging, to, the, extinct, subfamily, machairodontinae, with, an, estimated, date, of, divergence, from, the, ancestor, of, living, cats, around, 20, million, years, ago, smilodon, was, one, of, the, last, surviving, machairodonts, alongside, the, distantly, related, homotherium, smilodon, lived, in, the, americas, during, the, pleistocene, epoch, 2, 5, mya, 10, 000, years, ago, the, genus, was, named, in, 1842, based, on, fossils, from, brazil, the, generic, name, means, scalpel, or, two, edged, knife, combined, with, tooth, three, species, are, recognized, today, s, gracilis, s, fatalis, and, s, populator, the, two, latter, species, were, probably, descended, from, s, gracilis, which, itself, probably, evolved, from, megantereon, the, hundreds, of, specimens, obtained, from, the, la, brea, tar, pits, in, los, angeles, constitute, the, largest, collection, of, smilodon, fossils, overall, smilodon, was, more, robustly, built, than, any, extant, cat, with, particularly, well, developed, forelimbs, and, exceptionally, long, upper, canine, teeth, its, jaw, had, a, bigger, gape, than, that, of, modern, cats, and, its, upper, canines, were, slender, and, fragile, being, adapted, for, precision, killing, s, gracilis, was, the, smallest, species, at, 55, to, 100, kg, 121, to, 220, lb, in, weight, s, fatalis, had, a, weight, of, 160, to, 280, kg, 350, to, 620, lb, and, height, of, 100, cm, 39, in, both, of, these, species, are, mainly, known, from, north, america, but, remains, from, south, america, have, also, been, attributed, to, them, s, populator, from, south, america, was, the, largest, species, at, 220, to, 436, kg, 485, to, 961, lb, in, weight, and, 120, cm, 47, in, in, height, and, was, among, the, largest, known, felids, the, coat, pattern, of, smilodon, is, unknown, but, it, has, been, artistically, restored, with, plain, or, spotted, patterns, in, north, america, smilodon, hunted, large, herbivores, such, as, bison, and, camels, and, it, remained, successful, even, when, encountering, new, prey, species, in, south, america, smilodon, is, thought, to, have, killed, its, prey, by, holding, it, still, with, its, forelimbs, and, biting, it, but, it, is, unclear, in, what, manner, the, bite, itself, was, delivered, scientists, debate, whether, smilodon, had, a, social, or, a, solitary, lifestyle, analysis, of, modern, predator, behavior, as, well, as, of, smilodon, s, fossil, remains, could, be, construed, to, lend, support, to, either, view, smilodon, probably, lived, in, closed, habitats, such, as, forests, and, bush, which, would, have, provided, cover, for, ambushing, prey, smilodon, died, out, as, part, of, the, end, pleistocene, extinction, event, around, 13, 10, 000, years, ago, along, with, most, other, large, animals, across, the, americas, its, reliance, on, large, animals, has, been, proposed, as, the, cause, of, its, extinction, s, fatalis, may, have, been, impacted, by, habitat, turnover, and, loss, of, prey, it, specialized, on, due, to, possible, climatic, impacts, the, effects, of, recently, arrived, humans, on, prey, populations, and, other, factors, while, the, extinction, of, s, populator, remains, poorly, understood, during, the, 1830s, danish, naturalist, peter, wilhelm, lund, and, his, assistants, collected, fossils, in, the, calcareous, caves, near, the, small, town, of, lagoa, santa, minas, gerais, brazil, among, the, thousands, of, fossils, found, he, recognized, a, few, isolated, cheek, teeth, as, belonging, to, a, hyena, which, he, named, hyaena, neogaea, in, 1839, after, more, material, was, found, including, canine, teeth, and, foot, bones, lund, concluded, the, fossils, instead, belonged, to, a, distinct, genus, of, felids, though, transitional, to, the, hyenas, he, stated, it, would, have, matched, the, largest, modern, predators, in, size, and, was, more, robust, than, any, modern, cat, lund, originally, wanted, to, call, the, new, genus, hyaenodon, but, realizing, this, name, had, recently, been, applied, to, another, prehistoric, predator, he, instead, named, it, smilodon, populator, in, 1842, he, explained, the, ancient, greek, meaning, of, smilodon, as, smil, scalpel, or, two, edged, knife, and, odo, ntos, tooth, this, has, also, been, translated, as, tooth, shaped, like, double, edged, knife, he, explained, the, species, name, populator, as, the, destroyer, which, has, also, been, translated, as, he, who, brings, devastation, by, 1846, lund, had, acquired, nearly, every, part, of, the, skeleton, from, different, individuals, and, more, specimens, were, found, in, neighboring, countries, by, other, collectors, in, the, following, years, though, some, later, authors, used, lund, s, original, species, name, neogaea, instead, of, populator, it, is, now, considered, an, invalid, nomen, nudum, as, it, was, not, accompanied, with, a, proper, description, and, no, type, specimens, were, designated, some, south, american, specimens, have, been, referred, to, other, genera, subgenera, species, and, subspecies, such, as, smilodontidion, riggii, smilodon, prosmilodon, ensenadensis, and, s, bonaeriensis, but, these, are, now, thought, to, be, junior, synonyms, of, s, populator, fossils, of, smilodon, were, discovered, in, north, america, from, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, onwards, in, 1869, american, paleontologist, joseph, leidy, described, a, maxilla, fragment, with, a, molar, which, had, been, discovered, in, a, petroleum, bed, in, hardin, county, texas, he, referred, the, specimen, to, the, genus, felis, which, was, then, used, for, most, cats, extant, as, well, as, extinct, but, found, it, distinct, enough, to, be, part, of, its, own, subgenus, as, f, trucifelis, fatalis, the, species, name, means, deadly, in, an, 1880, article, about, extinct, american, cats, american, paleontologist, edward, drinker, cope, pointed, out, that, the, f, fatalis, molar, was, identical, to, that, of, smilodon, and, he, proposed, the, new, combination, s, fatalis, most, north, american, finds, were, scanty, until, excavations, began, in, the, la, brea, tar, pits, in, los, angeles, where, hundreds, of, individuals, of, s, fatalis, have, been, found, since, 1875, s, fatalis, has, junior, synonyms, such, as, s, mercerii, s, floridanus, and, s, californicus, american, paleontologist, annalisa, berta, considered, the, holotype, of, s, fatalis, too, incomplete, to, be, an, adequate, type, specimen, and, the, species, has, at, times, been, proposed, to, be, a, junior, synonym, of, s, populator, nordic, paleontologists, bj, rn, kurt, n, and, lars, werdelin, supported, the, distinctness, of, the, two, species, in, an, article, published, in, 1990, a, 2018, article, by, the, american, paleontologist, john, p, babiarz, and, colleagues, concluded, that, s, californicus, represented, by, the, specimens, from, the, la, brea, tar, pits, was, a, distinct, species, from, s, fatalis, after, all, and, that, more, research, is, needed, to, clarify, the, taxonomy, of, the, lineage, in, his, 1880, article, about, extinct, cats, cope, also, named, a, third, species, of, smilodon, s, gracilis, the, species, was, based, on, a, partial, canine, which, had, been, obtained, in, the, port, kennedy, cave, near, the, schuylkill, river, in, pennsylvania, cope, found, the, canine, to, be, distinct, from, that, of, the, other, smilodon, species, due, to, its, smaller, size, and, more, compressed, base, its, specific, name, refers, to, the, species, lighter, build, this, species, is, known, from, fewer, and, less, complete, remains, than, the, other, members, of, the, genus, s, gracilis, has, at, times, been, considered, part, of, genera, such, as, megantereon, and, ischyrosmilus, s, populator, s, fatalis, and, s, gracilis, are, currently, considered, the, only, valid, species, of, smilodon, and, features, used, to, define, most, of, their, junior, synonyms, have, been, dismissed, as, variation, between, individuals, of, the, same, species, intraspecific, variation, one, of, the, most, famous, of, prehistoric, mammals, smilodon, has, often, been, featured, in, popular, media, and, is, the, state, fossil, of, california, long, the, most, completely, known, saber, toothed, cat, smilodon, is, still, one, of, the, best, known, members, of, the, group, to, the, point, where, the, two, concepts, have, been, confused, the, term, saber, tooth, itself, refers, to, an, ecomorph, consisting, of, various, groups, of, extinct, predatory, synapsids, mammals, and, close, relatives, which, convergently, evolved, extremely, long, maxillary, canines, as, well, as, adaptations, to, the, skull, and, skeleton, related, to, their, use, this, includes, members, of, gorgonopsia, thylacosmilidae, machaeroidinae, nimravidae, barbourofelidae, and, machairodontinae, within, the, family, felidae, true, cats, members, of, the, subfamily, machairodontinae, are, referred, to, as, saber, toothed, cats, and, this, group, is, itself, divided, into, three, tribes, metailurini, false, saber, tooths, homotherini, scimitar, toothed, cats, and, smilodontini, dirk, toothed, cats, to, which, smilodon, belongs, members, of, smilodontini, are, defined, by, their, long, slender, canines, with, fine, to, no, serrations, whereas, homotherini, are, typified, by, shorter, broad, and, more, flattened, canines, with, coarser, serrations, members, of, metailurini, were, less, specialized, and, had, shorter, less, flattened, canines, and, are, not, recognized, as, members, of, machairodontinae, by, some, researchers, despite, the, colloquial, name, saber, toothed, tiger, smilodon, is, not, closely, related, to, the, modern, tiger, which, belongs, in, the, subfamily, pantherinae, or, any, other, extant, felid, a, 1992, ancient, dna, analysis, suggested, that, smilodon, should, be, grouped, with, modern, cats, subfamilies, felinae, and, pantherinae, a, 2005, study, found, that, smilodon, belonged, to, a, separate, lineage, a, study, published, in, 2006, confirmed, this, showing, that, the, machairodontinae, diverged, early, from, the, ancestors, of, living, cats, and, were, not, closely, related, to, any, living, species, the, ancestors, of, living, cats, and, machairodontinae, estimated, to, have, diverged, around, 20, million, years, ago, the, following, cladogram, based, on, fossils, and, dna, analysis, shows, the, placement, of, smilodon, among, extinct, and, extant, felids, after, rinc, n, and, colleagues, 2011, proailurus, pseudaelurus, panthera, tigers, lions, jaguars, and, leopards, caracal, leopardus, ocelot, and, relatives, felis, domestic, cats, and, relatives, herpailurus, jaguarundi, miracinonyx, puma, cougar, dinofelis, nimravides, machairodus, homotherium, xenosmilus, paramachairodus, megantereon, smilodon, gracilis, smilodon, populator, smilodon, fatalis, the, earliest, felids, are, known, from, the, oligocene, of, europe, such, as, proailurus, and, the, earliest, one, with, saber, tooth, features, is, the, miocene, genus, pseudaelurus, the, skull, and, mandible, morphology, of, the, earliest, saber, toothed, cats, was, similar, to, that, of, the, modern, clouded, leopards, neofelis, the, lineage, further, adapted, to, the, precision, killing, of, large, animals, by, developing, elongated, canine, teeth, and, wider, gapes, in, the, process, sacrificing, high, bite, force, as, their, canines, became, longer, the, bodies, of, the, cats, became, more, robust, for, immobilizing, prey, in, derived, smilodontins, and, homotherins, the, lumbar, region, of, the, spine, and, the, tail, became, shortened, as, did, the, hind, limbs, machairodonts, once, represented, a, dominant, group, of, felids, distributed, across, africa, eurasia, and, the, north, america, during, the, miocene, and, pliocene, epochs, but, progressively, declined, over, the, course, of, the, pleistocene, by, the, late, pleistocene, only, two, genera, of, machairodonts, remained, smilodon, and, the, distantly, related, homotherium, both, largely, confined, to, the, americas, based, on, mitochondrial, dna, sequences, extracted, from, ancient, bones, the, lineages, of, homotherium, and, smilodon, are, estimated, to, have, diverged, about, 18, million, years, ago, the, earliest, species, of, smilodon, is, s, gracilis, which, existed, from, 2, 5, million, to, 500, 000, years, ago, early, blancan, to, irvingtonian, ages, and, was, the, successor, in, north, america, of, megantereon, from, which, it, probably, evolved, megantereon, itself, had, entered, north, america, from, eurasia, during, the, pliocene, along, with, homotherium, s, gracilis, reached, the, northern, regions, of, south, america, in, the, early, pleistocene, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, s, fatalis, existed, 1, 6, million, 10, 000, years, ago, late, irvingtonian, to, rancholabrean, ages, and, replaced, s, gracilis, in, north, america, s, populator, existed, 1, million, 10, 000, years, ago, ensenadan, to, lujanian, ages, it, occurred, in, the, eastern, parts, of, south, america, smilodon, was, around, the, size, of, modern, big, cats, but, was, more, robustly, built, it, had, a, reduced, lumbar, region, high, scapula, short, tail, and, broad, limbs, with, relatively, short, feet, smilodon, is, most, famous, for, its, relatively, long, canine, teeth, which, are, the, longest, found, in, the, saber, toothed, cats, at, about, 28, cm, 11, in, long, in, the, largest, species, s, populator, the, canines, were, slender, and, had, fine, serrations, on, the, front, and, back, side, the, skull, was, robustly, proportioned, and, the, muzzle, was, short, and, broad, the, cheek, bones, zygomata, were, deep, and, widely, arched, the, sagittal, crest, was, prominent, and, the, frontal, region, was, slightly, convex, the, mandible, had, a, flange, on, each, side, of, the, front, the, upper, incisors, were, large, sharp, and, slanted, forwards, there, was, a, diastema, gap, between, the, incisors, and, molars, of, the, mandible, the, lower, incisors, were, broad, recurved, and, placed, in, a, straight, line, across, the, p3, premolar, tooth, of, the, mandible, was, present, in, most, early, specimens, but, lost, in, later, specimens, it, was, only, present, in, 6, of, the, la, brea, sample, there, is, some, dispute, over, whether, smilodon, was, sexually, dimorphic, some, studies, of, s, fatalis, fossils, have, found, little, difference, between, the, sexes, conversely, a, 2012, study, found, that, while, fossils, of, s, fatalis, show, less, variation, in, size, among, individuals, than, modern, panthera, they, do, appear, to, show, the, same, difference, between, the, sexes, in, some, traits, s, gracilis, was, the, smallest, species, estimated, at, 55, to, 100, kg, 121, to, 220, lb, in, weight, about, the, size, of, a, jaguar, it, was, similar, to, its, predecessor, megantereon, of, the, same, size, but, its, dentition, and, skull, were, more, advanced, approaching, s, fatalis, s, fatalis, was, intermediate, in, size, between, s, gracilis, and, s, populator, it, ranged, from, 160, to, 280, kg, 350, to, 620, lb, and, reached, a, shoulder, height, of, 100, cm, 39, in, and, body, length, of, 175, cm, 69, in, it, was, similar, to, a, lion, in, dimensions, but, was, more, robust, and, muscular, and, therefore, had, a, larger, body, mass, its, skull, was, also, similar, to, that, of, megantereon, though, more, massive, and, with, larger, canines, s, populator, was, among, the, largest, known, felids, with, a, body, mass, range, from, 220, kg, 490, lb, to, over, 400, kg, 880, lb, and, one, estimate, suggesting, up, to, 470, kg, 1, 040, lb, a, particularly, large, s, populator, skull, from, uruguay, measuring, 39, 2, cm, 15, 4, in, in, length, indicates, this, individual, may, have, weighed, as, much, as, 436, kg, 961, lb, it, stood, at, a, shoulder, height, of, 120, cm, 47, in, compared, to, s, fatalis, s, populator, was, more, robust, and, had, a, more, elongated, and, narrow, skull, with, a, straighter, upper, profile, higher, positioned, nasal, bones, a, more, vertical, occiput, more, massive, metapodials, and, slightly, longer, forelimbs, relative, to, hindlimbs, large, fossil, tracks, from, argentina, for, which, the, ichnotaxon, name, smilodonichium, has, been, proposed, have, been, attributed, to, s, populator, and, measure, 17, 6, cm, 6, 9, in, by, 19, 2, cm, 7, 6, in, this, is, larger, than, tracks, of, the, bengal, tiger, to, which, the, footprints, have, been, compared, smilodon, and, other, saber, toothed, cats, have, been, reconstructed, with, both, plain, colored, coats, and, with, spotted, patterns, which, appears, to, be, the, ancestral, condition, for, feliforms, both, of, which, are, considered, possible, studies, of, modern, cat, species, have, found, that, species, that, live, in, the, open, tend, to, have, uniform, coats, while, those, that, live, in, more, vegetated, habitats, have, more, markings, with, some, exceptions, some, coat, features, such, as, the, manes, of, male, lions, or, the, stripes, of, the, tiger, are, too, unusual, to, predict, from, fossils, traditionally, saber, toothed, cats, have, been, artistically, restored, with, external, features, similar, to, those, of, extant, felids, by, artists, such, as, charles, r, knight, in, collaboration, with, various, paleontologists, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, 1969, paleontologist, g, j, miller, instead, proposed, that, smilodon, would, have, looked, very, different, from, a, typical, cat, and, similar, to, a, bulldog, with, a, lower, lip, line, to, allow, its, mouth, to, open, wide, without, tearing, the, facial, tissues, a, more, retracted, nose, and, lower, placed, ears, paleoartist, mauricio, ant, n, and, coauthors, disputed, this, in, 1998, and, maintained, that, the, facial, features, of, smilodon, were, overall, not, very, different, from, those, of, other, cats, ant, n, noted, that, modern, animals, like, the, hippopotamus, are, able, to, open, their, mouths, extremely, wide, without, tearing, tissue, due, to, a, folded, orbicularis, oris, muscle, and, such, a, muscle, arrangement, exists, in, modern, large, felids, ant, n, stated, that, extant, phylogenetic, bracketing, where, the, features, of, the, closest, extant, relatives, of, a, fossil, taxon, are, used, as, reference, is, the, most, reliable, way, of, restoring, the, life, appearance, of, prehistoric, animals, and, the, cat, like, smilodon, restorations, by, knight, are, therefore, still, accurate, a, 2022, study, by, ant, n, and, colleagues, concluded, that, the, upper, canines, of, smilodon, would, have, been, visible, when, the, mouth, was, closed, while, those, of, homotherium, would, have, not, after, examining, fossils, and, extant, big, cats, an, apex, predator, smilodon, primarily, hunted, large, mammals, isotopes, preserved, in, the, bones, of, s, fatalis, in, the, la, brea, tar, pits, reveal, that, ruminants, like, bison, bison, antiquus, which, was, much, larger, than, the, modern, american, bison, and, camels, camelops, were, most, commonly, taken, by, the, cats, there, smilodon, fatalis, may, have, also, occasionally, preyed, upon, glyptotherium, based, on, a, skull, from, a, juvenile, glyptotherium, texanum, recovered, from, pleistocene, deposits, in, arizona, that, bear, the, distinctive, elliptical, puncture, marks, best, matching, those, of, smilodon, indicating, that, the, predator, successfully, bit, into, the, skull, through, the, glyptodont, s, armored, cephalic, shield, in, addition, isotopes, preserved, in, the, tooth, enamel, of, s, gracilis, specimens, from, florida, show, that, this, species, fed, on, the, peccary, platygonus, and, the, llama, like, hemiauchenia, stable, carbon, isotope, measurements, of, s, gracilis, remains, in, florida, varied, significantly, between, different, sites, and, show, that, the, species, was, flexible, in, its, feeding, habits, isotopic, studies, of, dire, wolf, aenocyon, dirus, and, american, lion, panthera, atrox, bones, show, an, overlap, with, s, fatalis, in, prey, which, suggests, that, they, were, competitors, more, detailed, isotope, analysis, however, indicates, that, smilodon, fatalis, preferred, forest, dwelling, prey, such, as, tapirs, deer, and, forest, dwelling, bison, as, opposed, to, the, dire, wolves, preferences, for, prey, inhabiting, open, areas, such, as, grassland, the, availability, of, prey, in, the, rancho, la, brea, area, was, likely, comparable, to, modern, east, africa, as, smilodon, migrated, to, south, america, its, diet, changed, bison, were, absent, the, horses, and, proboscideans, were, different, and, native, ungulates, such, as, toxodonts, and, litopterns, were, completely, unfamiliar, yet, s, populator, thrived, as, well, there, as, its, relatives, in, north, america, isotopic, analysis, for, s, populator, suggests, that, its, main, prey, species, included, toxodon, platensis, pachyarmatherium, holmesina, species, of, the, genus, panochthus, palaeolama, catonyx, equus, neogeus, and, the, crocodilian, caiman, latirostris, this, analysis, of, its, diet, also, indicates, that, s, populator, hunted, both, in, open, and, forested, habitats, the, differences, between, the, north, and, south, american, species, may, be, due, to, the, difference, in, prey, between, the, two, continents, smilodon, may, have, avoided, eating, bone, and, would, have, left, enough, food, for, scavengers, coprolites, assigned, to, s, populator, recovered, from, argentina, preserve, mylodon, osteoderms, and, a, lama, scaphoid, bone, in, addition, to, this, unambiguous, evidence, of, bone, consumption, the, coprolites, suggest, that, smilodon, had, a, more, generalist, diet, than, previously, thought, examinations, of, dental, microwear, from, la, brea, further, suggests, that, smilodon, consumed, both, flesh, and, bone, smilodon, itself, may, have, scavenged, dire, wolf, kills, it, has, been, suggested, that, smilodon, was, a, pure, scavenger, that, used, its, canines, for, display, to, assert, dominance, over, carcasses, but, this, theory, is, not, supported, today, as, no, modern, terrestrial, mammals, are, pure, scavengers, the, brain, of, smilodon, had, sulcal, patterns, similar, to, modern, cats, which, suggests, an, increased, complexity, of, the, regions, that, control, the, sense, of, hearing, sight, and, coordination, of, the, limbs, felid, saber, tooths, in, general, had, relatively, small, eyes, that, were, not, as, forward, facing, as, those, of, modern, cats, which, have, good, binocular, vision, to, help, them, move, in, trees, smilodon, was, likely, an, ambush, predator, that, concealed, itself, in, dense, vegetation, as, its, limb, proportions, were, similar, to, modern, forest, dwelling, cats, and, its, short, tail, would, not, have, helped, it, balance, while, running, unlike, its, ancestor, megantereon, which, was, at, least, partially, scansorial, and, therefore, able, to, climb, trees, smilodon, was, probably, completely, terrestrial, due, to, its, greater, weight, and, lack, of, climbing, adaptations, tracks, from, argentina, named, felipeda, miramarensis, in, 2019, may, have, been, produced, by, smilodon, if, correctly, identified, the, tracks, indicate, that, the, animal, had, fully, retractible, claws, plantigrade, feet, lacked, strong, supination, capabilities, in, its, paws, notably, robust, forelimbs, compared, to, the, hindlimbs, and, was, probably, an, ambush, predator, the, heel, bone, of, smilodon, was, fairly, long, which, suggests, it, was, a, good, jumper, its, well, developed, flexor, and, extensor, muscles, in, its, forearms, probably, enabled, it, to, pull, down, and, securely, hold, down, large, prey, analysis, of, the, cross, sections, of, s, fatalis, humeri, indicated, that, they, were, strengthened, by, cortical, thickening, to, such, an, extent, that, they, would, have, been, able, to, sustain, greater, loading, than, those, of, extant, big, cats, or, of, the, extinct, american, lion, the, humerus, cortical, wall, in, s, fatalis, was, a, 15, thicker, than, excpected, in, modern, big, cats, of, similar, size, the, thickening, of, s, fatalis, femurs, was, within, the, range, of, extant, felids, its, canines, were, fragile, and, could, not, have, bitten, into, bone, due, to, the, risk, of, breaking, these, cats, had, to, subdue, and, restrain, their, prey, with, their, powerful, forelimbs, before, they, could, use, their, canine, teeth, and, likely, used, quick, slashing, or, stabbing, bites, rather, than, the, slow, suffocating, bites, typically, used, by, modern, cats, on, rare, occasions, as, evidenced, by, fossils, smilodon, was, willing, to, risk, biting, into, bone, with, its, canines, this, may, have, been, focused, more, towards, competition, such, as, other, smilodon, or, potential, threats, such, as, other, carnivores, than, on, prey, debate, continues, as, to, how, smilodon, killed, its, prey, traditionally, the, most, popular, theory, is, that, the, cat, delivered, a, deep, stabbing, bite, or, open, jawed, stabbing, thrust, to, the, throat, killing, the, prey, very, quickly, another, hypothesis, suggests, that, smilodon, targeted, the, belly, of, its, prey, this, is, disputed, as, the, curvature, of, their, prey, s, belly, would, likely, have, prevented, the, cat, from, getting, a, good, bite, or, stab, in, regard, to, how, smilodon, delivered, its, bite, the, canine, shear, bite, hypothesis, has, been, favored, where, flexion, of, the, neck, and, rotation, of, the, skull, assisted, in, biting, the, prey, but, this, may, be, mechanically, impossible, however, evidence, from, comparisons, with, homotherium, suggest, that, smilodon, was, fully, capable, of, and, utilized, the, canine, shear, bite, as, its, primary, means, of, killing, prey, based, on, the, fact, that, it, had, a, thick, skull, and, relatively, little, trabecular, bone, while, homotherium, had, both, more, trabecular, bone, and, a, more, lion, like, clamping, bite, as, its, primary, means, of, attacking, prey, the, discovery, made, by, figueirido, and, lautenschlager, et, al, published, in, 2018, suggests, extremely, different, ecological, adaptations, in, both, machairodonts, the, mandibular, flanges, may, have, helped, resist, bending, forces, when, the, mandible, was, pulled, against, the, hide, of, a, prey, animal, it, has, been, experimentally, proven, by, means, of, a, machine, that, recreates, the, teeth, and, simulates, the, movements, of, jaws, and, neck, of, smilodon, fatalis, the, robocat, on, bison, and, elk, carcasses, that, the, stabbing, bite, to, the, throat, is, a, much, more, plausible, and, practical, killing, technique, than, the, stabbing, bite, to, the, belly, the, protruding, incisors, were, arranged, in, an, arch, and, were, used, to, hold, the, prey, still, and, stabilize, it, while, the, canine, bite, was, delivered, the, contact, surface, between, the, canine, crown, and, the, gum, was, enlarged, which, helped, stabilize, the, tooth, and, helped, the, cat, sense, when, the, tooth, had, penetrated, to, its, maximum, extent, since, saber, toothed, cats, generally, had, a, relatively, large, infraorbital, foramen, opening, in, the, skull, which, housed, nerves, associated, with, the, whiskers, it, has, been, suggested, the, improved, senses, would, have, helped, the, cats, precision, when, biting, outside, their, field, of, vision, and, thereby, prevent, breakage, of, the, canines, the, blade, like, carnassial, teeth, were, used, to, cut, skin, to, access, the, meat, and, the, reduced, molars, suggest, that, they, were, less, adapted, for, crushing, bones, than, modern, cats, as, the, food, of, modern, cats, enters, the, mouth, through, the, side, while, cutting, with, the, carnassials, not, the, front, incisors, between, the, canines, the, animals, do, not, need, to, gape, widely, so, the, canines, of, smilodon, would, likewise, not, have, been, a, hindrance, when, feeding, a, study, published, in, 2022, of, how, machairodonts, fed, revealed, that, wear, patterns, on, the, teeth, of, s, fatalis, also, suggest, that, it, was, capable, of, eating, bone, to, a, similar, extent, as, lions, this, and, comparisons, with, bite, marks, left, by, the, contemporary, machairodont, xenosmilus, suggest, that, smilodon, and, its, relatives, could, efficiently, de, flesh, a, carcass, of, meat, when, feeding, without, being, hindered, by, their, long, canines, despite, being, more, powerfully, built, than, other, large, cats, smilodon, had, a, weaker, bite, modern, big, cats, have, more, pronounced, zygomatic, arches, while, these, were, smaller, in, smilodon, which, restricted, the, thickness, and, therefore, power, of, the, temporalis, muscles, and, thus, reduced, smilodon, s, bite, force, analysis, of, its, narrow, jaws, indicates, that, it, could, produce, a, bite, only, a, third, as, strong, as, that, of, a, lion, the, bite, force, quotient, measured, for, the, lion, is, 112, there, seems, to, be, a, general, rule, that, the, saber, toothed, cats, with, the, largest, canines, had, proportionally, weaker, bites, analyses, of, canine, bending, strength, the, ability, of, the, canine, teeth, to, resist, bending, forces, without, breaking, and, bite, forces, indicate, that, the, saber, toothed, cats, teeth, were, stronger, relative, to, the, bite, force, than, those, of, modern, big, cats, in, addition, smilodon, s, gape, could, have, reached, over, 110, degrees, while, that, of, the, modern, lion, reaches, 65, degrees, this, made, the, gape, wide, enough, to, allow, smilodon, to, grasp, large, prey, despite, the, long, canines, a, 2018, study, compared, the, killing, behavior, of, smilodon, fatalis, and, homotherium, serum, and, found, that, the, former, had, a, strong, skull, with, little, trabecular, bone, for, a, stabbing, canine, shear, bite, whereas, the, latter, had, more, trabecular, bone, and, used, a, clamp, and, hold, style, more, similar, to, lions, the, two, would, therefore, have, held, distinct, ecological, niches, many, smilodon, specimens, have, been, excavated, from, asphalt, seeps, that, acted, as, natural, carnivore, traps, animals, were, accidentally, trapped, in, the, seeps, and, became, bait, for, predators, that, came, to, scavenge, but, these, were, then, trapped, themselves, the, best, known, of, such, traps, are, at, la, brea, in, los, angeles, which, have, produced, over, 166, 000, smilodon, fatalis, specimens, that, form, the, largest, collection, in, the, world, the, sediments, of, the, pits, there, were, accumulated, 40, 000, to, 10, 000, years, ago, in, the, late, pleistocene, though, the, trapped, animals, were, buried, quickly, predators, often, managed, to, remove, limb, bones, from, them, but, they, were, themselves, often, trapped, and, then, scavenged, by, other, predators, 90, of, the, excavated, bones, belonged, to, predators, the, talara, tar, seeps, in, peru, represent, a, similar, scenario, and, have, also, produced, fossils, of, smilodon, unlike, in, la, brea, many, of, the, bones, were, broken, or, show, signs, of, weathering, this, may, have, been, because, the, layers, were, shallower, so, the, thrashing, of, trapped, animals, damaged, the, bones, of, previously, trapped, animals, many, of, the, carnivores, at, talara, were, juveniles, possibly, indicating, that, inexperienced, and, less, fit, animals, had, a, greater, chance, of, being, trapped, though, lund, thought, accumulations, of, smilodon, and, herbivore, fossils, in, the, lagoa, santa, caves, were, due, to, the, cats, using, the, caves, as, dens, these, are, probably, the, result, of, animals, dying, on, the, surface, and, water, currents, subsequently, dragging, their, bones, to, the, floor, of, the, cave, but, some, individuals, may, also, have, died, after, becoming, lost, in, the, caves, scientists, debate, whether, smilodon, was, social, one, study, of, african, predators, found, that, social, predators, like, lions, and, spotted, hyenas, respond, more, to, the, distress, calls, of, prey, than, solitary, species, since, s, fatalis, fossils, are, common, at, the, la, brea, tar, pits, and, were, likely, attracted, by, the, distress, calls, of, stuck, prey, this, could, mean, that, this, species, was, social, as, well, one, critical, study, claims, that, the, study, neglects, other, factors, such, as, body, mass, heavier, animals, are, more, likely, to, get, stuck, than, lighter, ones, intelligence, some, social, animals, like, the, american, lion, may, have, avoided, the, tar, because, they, were, better, able, to, recognize, the, hazard, lack, of, visual, and, olfactory, lures, the, type, of, audio, lure, and, the, length, of, the, distress, calls, the, actual, distress, calls, of, the, trapped, prey, animals, would, have, lasted, longer, than, the, calls, used, in, the, study, the, author, of, that, study, ponders, what, predators, would, have, responded, if, the, recordings, were, played, in, india, where, the, otherwise, solitary, tigers, are, known, to, aggregate, around, a, single, carcass, the, authors, of, the, original, study, responded, that, though, effects, of, the, calls, in, the, tar, pits, and, the, playback, experiments, would, not, be, identical, this, would, not, be, enough, to, overturn, their, conclusions, in, addition, they, stated, that, weight, and, intelligence, would, not, likely, affect, the, results, as, lighter, carnivores, are, far, more, numerous, than, heavy, herbivores, and, the, social, and, seemingly, intelligent, dire, wolf, is, also, found, in, the, pits, another, argument, for, sociality, is, based, on, the, healed, injuries, in, several, smilodon, fossils, which, would, suggest, that, the, animals, needed, others, to, provide, them, food, this, argument, has, been, questioned, as, cats, can, recover, quickly, from, even, severe, bone, damage, and, an, injured, smilodon, could, survive, if, it, had, access, to, water, however, a, smilodon, suffering, hip, dysplasia, at, a, young, age, that, survived, to, adulthood, suggests, that, it, could, not, have, survived, to, adulthood, without, aid, from, a, social, group, as, this, individual, was, unable, to, hunt, or, defend, its, territory, due, to, the, severity, of, its, congenital, issue, the, brain, of, smilodon, was, relatively, small, compared, to, other, cat, species, some, researchers, have, argued, that, smilodon, s, brain, would, have, been, too, small, for, it, to, have, been, a, social, animal, an, analysis, of, brain, size, in, living, big, cats, found, no, correlation, between, brain, size, and, sociality, another, argument, against, smilodon, being, social, is, that, being, an, ambush, hunter, in, closed, habitat, would, likely, have, made, group, living, unnecessary, as, in, most, modern, cats, yet, it, has, also, been, proposed, that, being, the, largest, predator, in, an, environment, comparable, to, the, savanna, of, africa, smilodon, may, have, had, a, social, structure, similar, to, modern, lions, which, possibly, live, in, groups, primarily, to, defend, optimal, territory, from, other, lions, lions, are, the, only, social, big, cats, today, whether, smilodon, was, sexually, dimorphic, has, implications, for, its, reproductive, behavior, based, on, their, conclusions, that, smilodon, fatalis, had, no, sexual, dimorphism, van, valkenburgh, and, sacco, suggested, in, 2002, that, if, the, cats, were, social, they, would, likely, have, lived, in, monogamous, pairs, along, with, offspring, with, no, intense, competition, among, males, for, females, likewise, meachen, samuels, and, binder, concluded, in, 2010, that, aggression, between, males, was, less, pronounced, in, s, fatalis, than, in, the, american, lion, christiansen, and, harris, found, in, 2012, that, as, s, fatalis, did, exhibit, some, sexual, dimorphism, there, would, have, been, evolutionary, selection, for, competition, between, males, some, bones, show, evidence, of, having, been, bitten, by, other, smilodon, possibly, the, result, of, territorial, battles, competition, for, breeding, rights, or, over, prey, two, s, populator, skulls, from, argentina, show, seemingly, fatal, unhealed, wounds, which, appear, to, have, been, caused, by, the, canines, of, another, smilodon, though, it, cannot, be, ruled, out, they, were, caused, by, kicking, prey, if, caused, by, intraspecific, fighting, it, may, also, indicate, that, they, had, social, behavior, which, could, lead, to, death, as, seen, in, some, modern, felines, as, well, as, indicating, that, the, canines, could, penetrate, bone, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, exaggerated, canines, of, saber, toothed, cats, evolved, for, sexual, display, and, competition, but, a, statistical, study, of, the, correlation, between, canine, and, body, size, in, s, populator, found, no, difference, in, scaling, between, body, and, canine, size, concluded, it, was, more, likely, they, evolved, solely, for, a, predatory, function, a, set, of, three, associated, skeletons, of, s, fatalis, found, in, ecuador, and, described, in, 2021, by, reynolds, seymour, and, evans, suggests, that, there, was, prolonged, parental, care, in, smilodon, the, two, subadult, individuals, uncovered, share, a, unique, inherited, trait, in, their, dentaries, suggesting, they, were, siblings, a, rare, instance, of, familial, relationships, being, found, in, the, fossil, record, the, subadult, specimens, are, also, hypothesized, to, have, been, male, and, female, respectively, while, the, adult, skeletal, remains, found, at, the, site, are, believed, to, have, belonged, to, their, mother, the, subadults, were, estimated, to, have, been, around, two, years, of, age, at, the, time, of, their, deaths, but, were, still, growing, s, fatalis, had, proportionally, larger, hyoid, bones, than, modern, felid, species, and, thus, likely, produced, deeper, vocalizations, while, smilodon, had, the, same, number, of, hyoid, bones, as, the, roaring, cats, their, shape, was, closer, to, that, of, purring, species, smilodon, started, developing, its, adult, saber, teeth, when, the, animal, reached, between, 12, and, 19, months, of, age, shortly, after, the, completion, of, the, eruption, of, the, cat, s, baby, teeth, both, baby, and, adult, canines, would, be, present, side, by, side, in, the, mouth, for, an, approximately, 11, month, period, and, the, muscles, used, in, making, the, powerful, bite, were, developed, at, about, one, and, a, half, years, old, as, well, eight, months, earlier, than, in, a, modern, lion, after, smilodon, reached, 23, to, 30, months, of, age, the, infant, teeth, were, shed, while, the, adult, canines, grew, at, an, average, growth, rate, of, 7, mm, 0, 28, in, per, month, during, a, 12, month, period, they, reached, their, full, size, at, around, 3, years, of, age, later, than, modern, species, of, big, cats, juvenile, and, adolescent, smilodon, specimens, are, extremely, rare, at, rancho, la, brea, where, the, study, was, performed, indicating, that, they, remained, hidden, or, at, denning, sites, during, hunts, and, depended, on, parental, care, while, their, canines, were, developing, a, 2024, study, found, evidence, that, adolescent, smilodon, kept, their, milk, sabers, for, extended, periods, estimated, at, 30, months, to, help, reinforce, their, adult, canines, as, they, grew, in, as, a, result, the, milk, sabers, acted, as, a, structural, support, allowing, them, to, begin, hunting, with, minimized, risk, to, their, mature, set, of, sabers, as, a, result, the, retention, of, the, cat, s, milk, sabers, lessened, the, bending, strain, on, the, cat, s, emerging, adult, teeth, as, it, bit, down, as, it, was, discovered, the, erupting, sabers, were, much, more, vulnerable, to, breakage, as, they, grew, in, than, when, matured, this, would, have, also, resulted, in, smilodon, being, double, fanged, during, this, growth, stage, as, corroborated, by, the, discovery, of, individuals, at, this, ontogenic, stage, at, rancho, la, brea, a, 2017, study, indicates, that, juveniles, were, born, with, a, robust, build, similar, to, the, adults, comparison, of, the, bones, of, juvenile, s, fatalis, specimens, from, la, brea, with, those, of, the, contemporaneous, american, lion, revealed, that, the, two, cats, shared, a, similar, growth, curve, felid, forelimb, development, during, ontogeny, changes, during, growth, has, remained, tightly, constrained, the, curve, is, similar, to, that, for, modern, cats, such, as, tigers, and, cougars, but, shifts, more, towards, the, robust, direction, of, the, axes, than, is, seen, in, modern, felids, examinations, by, reynolds, seymour, and, evans, 2021, suggest, that, smilodon, had, a, unique, and, fast, growth, rate, similar, to, a, tiger, but, that, there, was, a, prolonged, period, of, growth, in, the, genus, similar, to, what, is, seen, in, lions, and, that, the, cubs, were, reliant, on, their, parents, until, this, growth, period, ended, several, smilodon, fossils, show, signs, of, ankylosing, spondylitis, hyperostosis, and, trauma, one, study, of, 1, 000, smilodon, skulls, found, that, 36, of, them, had, eroded, parietal, bones, which, is, where, the, largest, jaw, muscles, attach, they, also, showed, signs, of, microfractures, and, the, weakening, and, thinning, of, bones, possibly, caused, by, mechanical, stress, from, the, constant, need, to, make, stabbing, motions, with, the, canines, bony, growths, where, the, deltoid, muscle, inserted, in, the, humerus, is, a, common, pathology, for, a, la, brea, specimen, which, was, probably, due, to, repeated, strain, when, smilodon, attempted, to, pull, down, prey, with, its, forelimbs, sternum, injuries, are, also, common, probably, due, to, collision, with, prey, the, frequency, of, trauma, in, s, fatalis, specimens, was, 4, 3, compared, to, 2, 8, in, the, dire, wolf, which, implies, the, ambush, predatory, behavior, of, the, former, led, to, greater, risk, of, injury, than, the, pursuit, predatory, behavior, of, the, latter, smilodon, remains, exhibit, relatively, more, shoulder, and, lumbar, vertebrae, injuries, a, 2023, study, documented, a, high, degree, of, subchondral, defects, in, limb, joint, surfaces, of, s, fatalis, and, dire, wolf, specimens, from, the, la, brea, tar, pits, that, resembled, osteochondrosis, dissecans, as, modern, dogs, with, this, disease, are, inbred, the, researchers, suggested, this, would, have, been, the, case, for, the, prehistoric, species, as, well, as, they, approached, extinction, but, cautioned, that, more, research, was, needed, to, determine, if, this, was, also, the, case, in, specimens, from, other, parts, of, the, americas, osteomyelitis, in, the, left, fourth, metacarpal, bone, has, been, reported, in, a, s, populator, specimen, dating, back, to, marine, isotope, stage, 5, this, pathology, resulted, in, the, machairodont, individual, becoming, incapable, of, flexing, its, toe, and, would, have, severely, diminished, its, ability, to, hunt, prey, smilodon, lived, during, the, pleistocene, epoch, 2, 5, mya, 10, 000, years, ago, and, was, perhaps, the, most, recent, of, the, saber, toothed, cats, s, fatalis, lived, in, a, variety, of, habitats, being, able, to, inhabit, open, grassland, and, parkland, marginal, woodland, grassland, settings, and, closed, forests, fossils, of, the, genus, have, been, found, throughout, the, americas, the, northernmost, remains, of, the, genus, are, s, fatalis, fossils, from, alberta, canada, with, the, southernmost, remains, being, known, from, the, far, south, of, patagonia, the, habitat, of, north, america, varied, from, subtropical, forests, and, savannah, in, the, south, to, treeless, mammoth, steppes, in, the, north, the, mosaic, vegetation, of, woods, shrubs, and, grasses, in, southwestern, north, america, supported, large, herbivores, such, as, horses, bison, antelope, deer, camels, mammoths, mastodons, and, ground, sloths, north, america, also, supported, other, saber, toothed, cats, such, as, homotherium, and, xenosmilus, as, well, as, other, large, carnivores, including, dire, wolves, short, faced, bear, arctodus, simus, and, the, american, lion, competition, from, such, carnivores, may, have, prevented, north, american, s, fatalis, from, attaining, the, size, of, south, america, s, s, populator, the, similarity, in, size, of, s, fatalis, and, the, american, lion, suggests, niche, overlap, and, direct, competition, between, these, species, and, they, appear, to, have, fed, on, similarly, sized, prey, s, gracilis, entered, south, america, during, the, early, to, middle, pleistocene, where, it, probably, gave, rise, to, s, populator, which, lived, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, continent, s, fatalis, also, entered, western, south, america, in, the, late, pleistocene, and, the, two, species, were, thought, to, be, divided, by, the, andes, mountains, however, in, 2018, a, skull, of, s, fatalis, found, in, uruguay, east, of, the, andes, was, reported, which, puts, the, idea, that, the, two, species, were, allopatric, geographically, separated, into, question, the, american, interchange, resulted, in, a, mix, of, native, and, invasive, species, sharing, the, prairies, and, woodlands, in, south, america, north, american, herbivores, included, proboscideans, horses, camelids, and, deer, south, american, herbivores, included, toxodonts, litopterns, ground, sloths, and, glyptodonts, native, metatherian, predators, including, the, saber, toothed, thylacosmilids, had, gone, extinct, by, the, pliocene, and, were, replaced, by, north, american, carnivores, such, as, canids, bears, and, large, cats, s, populator, was, very, successful, while, homotherium, never, became, widespread, in, south, america, the, extinction, of, the, thylacosmilids, has, been, attributed, to, competition, with, smilodon, but, this, is, probably, incorrect, as, they, seem, to, have, disappeared, before, the, arrival, of, the, large, cats, the, phorusrhacid, terror, birds, may, have, dominated, the, large, predator, niche, in, south, america, until, smilodon, arrived, s, populator, may, have, been, able, to, reach, larger, size, than, s, fatalis, due, to, a, lack, of, competition, in, pleistocene, south, america, s, populator, arrived, after, the, extinction, of, arctotherium, angustidens, one, of, the, largest, carnivores, ever, and, could, therefore, assume, the, niche, of, mega, carnivore, s, populator, preferred, large, prey, from, open, habitats, such, as, grassland, and, plains, based, on, evidence, gathered, from, isotope, ratios, that, determined, the, animal, s, diet, in, this, way, the, south, american, smilodon, species, was, probably, similar, to, the, modern, lion, s, populator, probably, competed, with, the, canid, protocyon, there, but, not, with, the, jaguar, which, fed, primarily, on, smaller, prey, on, the, other, hand, morphometry, points, to, s, populator, being, best, adapted, for, more, closed, environments, along, with, most, of, the, new, world, pleistocene, megafauna, smilodon, became, extinct, by, 10, 000, years, ago, in, the, late, pleistocene, extinction, phases, of, north, and, south, america, its, extinction, has, been, linked, to, the, decline, and, extinction, of, large, herbivores, hence, smilodon, could, have, been, too, specialized, at, hunting, large, prey, and, may, have, been, unable, to, adapt, indeed, by, the, b, lling, aller, d, warming, event, and, before, the, younger, dryas, cooling, event, s, fatalis, showed, changes, in, cranial, morphology, that, hint, towards, increased, specialization, in, larger, prey, and, or, evolution, in, response, to, competition, with, other, carnivores, however, a, 2012, study, of, smilodon, tooth, wear, found, no, evidence, that, they, were, limited, by, food, resources, other, explanations, include, climate, change, and, competition, with, homo, sapiens, who, entered, the, americas, around, the, time, smilodon, disappeared, or, a, combination, of, several, factors, all, of, which, apply, to, the, general, late, pleistocene, extinction, event, rather, than, specifically, to, the, extinction, of, the, saber, toothed, cats, one, factor, often, cited, here, is, the, cooling, in, the, younger, dryas, which, may, have, drastically, reduced, the, habitable, space, for, many, species, in, terms, of, human, influence, there, is, evidence, of, a, fire, induced, regime, change, in, rancho, la, brea, that, preceded, the, extirpation, of, megafauna, in, the, area, with, humans, most, likely, responsible, for, the, increase, in, fire, intensity, writers, of, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, theorized, that, the, last, saber, toothed, cats, smilodon, and, homotherium, became, extinct, through, competition, with, the, faster, and, more, generalized, felids, that, replaced, them, it, was, even, proposed, that, the, saber, toothed, predators, were, inferior, to, modern, cats, as, the, ever, growing, canines, were, thought, to, inhibit, their, owners, from, feeding, properly, since, then, however, it, has, been, shown, that, the, diet, of, machairodontines, such, as, smilodon, and, homotherium, was, diverse, they, do, not, seem, to, have, been, limited, to, giant, animals, as, prey, as, suggested, before, but, fed, on, whatever, was, available, including, bovines, equines, and, camelids, additionally, non, machairodontine, felids, such, as, the, american, lion, and, miracinonyx, also, became, extinct, during, the, late, pleistocene, and, saber, toothed, and, conical, toothed, felids, had, formerly, coexisted, for, more, than, a, million, years, the, fact, that, saber, teeth, evolved, many, times, in, unrelated, lineages, also, attests, to, the, success, of, this, feature, the, youngest, direct, radiocarbon, date, for, s, fatalis, differs, from, that, of, s, populator, by, thousands, of, years, the, former, just, before, the, younger, dryas, cooling, event, and, the, latter, by, the, early, holocene, the, latest, s, fatalis, specimen, recovered, from, the, rancho, la, brea, tar, pits, has, been, dated, to, 13, 025, years, ago, a, specimen, of, s, fatalis, from, iowa, dates, to, 13, 605, 13, 455, years, before, present, bp, the, latest, smilodon, populator, remains, found, in, the, cave, of, cueva, del, medio, near, the, town, of, soria, northeast, ltima, esperanza, province, magallanes, region, in, southernmost, chile, have, been, dated, to, 10, 935, 11, 209, years, ago, the, most, recent, credible, carbon, 14, date, for, s, fatalis, has, been, given, as, 11, 130, bp, however, such, radiocarbon, dates, are, likely, uncalibrated, meaning, that, they, were, not, adjusted, from, calendar, years, to, regular, years, as, a, result, the, dates, appear, younger, than, they, actually, are, therefore, the, s, fatalis, specimen, from, rancho, la, brea, is, the, youngest, recorded, of, the, species, suggesting, extinction, before, the, younger, dryas, based, on, its, last, appearance, in, california, as, opposed, to, other, regions, where, megafauna, declined, by, the, younger, dryas
