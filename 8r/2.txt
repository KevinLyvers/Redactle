as, breakups, or, divorces, or, harassment, and, bullying, those, who, have, previously, attempted, suicide, are, at, a, higher, risk, for, future, attempts, effective, suicide, prevention, efforts, include, limiting, access, to, methods, of, suicide, such, as, firearms, drugs, and, poisons, treating, mental, disorders, and, substance, abuse, careful, media, reporting, about, suicide, improving, economic, conditions, and, dialectical, behaviour, therapy, dbt, although, crisis, hotlines, like, 988, are, common, resources, their, effectiveness, has, not, been, well, studied, suicides, resulted, in, 828, 000, deaths, globally, in, 2015, an, increase, from, 712, 000, deaths, in, 1990, this, makes, suicide, the, 10th, leading, cause, of, death, worldwide, approximately, 1, 5, of, all, deaths, worldwide, are, by, suicide, in, a, given, year, this, is, roughly, 12, per, 100, 000, people, by, gender, suicide, rates, are, generally, higher, among, men, than, women, ranging, from, 1, 5, times, higher, in, the, developing, world, to, 3, 5, times, higher, in, the, developed, world, in, the, western, world, non, fatal, suicide, attempts, are, more, common, among, young, people, and, women, suicide, is, generally, most, common, among, those, over, the, age, of, 70, however, in, certain, countries, those, aged, between, 15, and, 30, are, at, the, highest, risk, europe, had, the, highest, rates, of, suicide, by, region, in, 2015, there, are, an, estimated, 10, to, 20, million, non, fatal, attempted, suicides, every, year, non, fatal, suicide, attempts, may, lead, to, injury, and, long, term, disabilities, the, most, commonly, adopted, method, of, suicide, varies, from, country, to, country, and, is, partly, related, to, the, availability, of, effective, means, views, on, suicide, have, been, influenced, by, broad, existential, themes, such, as, religion, honor, and, the, meaning, of, life, the, abrahamic, religions, traditionally, consider, suicide, as, an, offense, towards, god, due, to, belief, in, the, sanctity, of, life, during, the, samurai, era, in, japan, a, form, of, suicide, known, as, seppuku, harakiri, was, respected, as, a, means, of, making, up, for, failure, or, as, a, form, of, protest, similarly, a, ritual, fast, unto, death, known, as, vatakkiruttal, tamil, va, akkiruttal, fasting, facing, north, was, a, tamil, ritual, suicide, in, ancient, india, during, the, sangam, age, suicide, and, attempted, suicide, while, previously, illegal, are, no, longer, so, in, most, western, countries, it, remains, a, criminal, offense, in, some, countries, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, suicide, has, been, used, on, rare, occasions, as, a, form, of, protest, it, has, also, been, committed, while, or, after, murdering, others, a, tactic, that, has, been, used, both, militarily, and, by, terrorists, suicide, is, often, seen, as, a, major, catastrophe, causing, significant, grief, to, the, deceased, s, relatives, friends, and, community, members, and, it, is, viewed, negatively, almost, everywhere, around, the, world, suicide, derived, from, latin, suicidium, is, the, act, of, taking, one, s, own, life, attempted, suicide, or, non, fatal, suicidal, behavior, amounts, to, self, injury, with, at, least, some, desire, to, end, one, s, life, that, does, not, result, in, death, assisted, suicide, occurs, when, one, individual, helps, another, bring, about, their, own, death, indirectly, via, providing, either, advice, or, the, means, to, the, end, this, is, in, contrast, to, euthanasia, where, another, person, takes, a, more, active, role, in, bringing, about, a, person, s, death, suicidal, ideation, is, thoughts, of, ending, one, s, life, but, not, taking, any, active, efforts, to, do, so, it, may, or, may, not, involve, exact, planning, or, intent, suicidality, is, defined, as, the, risk, of, suicide, usually, indicated, by, suicidal, ideation, or, intent, especially, as, evident, in, the, presence, of, a, well, elaborated, suicidal, plan, in, a, murder, suicide, or, homicide, suicide, the, individual, aims, at, taking, the, lives, of, others, at, the, same, time, a, special, case, of, this, is, extended, suicide, where, the, murder, is, motivated, by, seeing, the, murdered, persons, as, an, extension, of, their, self, suicide, in, which, the, reason, is, that, the, person, feels, that, they, are, not, part, of, society, is, known, as, egoistic, suicide, the, centre, for, suicide, prevention, in, canada, found, that, the, normal, verb, in, scholarly, research, and, journalism, for, the, act, of, suicide, was, commit, and, argued, for, destigmatizing, terminology, related, to, suicide, in, 2011, they, published, an, article, calling, for, changing, the, language, used, around, suicide, entitled, suicide, and, language, why, we, shouldn, t, use, the, c, word, the, american, psychological, association, lists, committed, suicide, as, a, term, to, avoid, because, it, frame, suicide, as, a, crime, some, advocacy, groups, recommend, using, the, terms, took, his, her, own, life, died, by, suicide, or, killed, him, herself, instead, of, committed, suicide, the, associated, press, stylebook, recommends, avoiding, committed, suicide, except, in, direct, quotes, from, authorities, the, guardian, and, observer, style, guides, deprecate, the, use, of, committed, as, does, cnn, opponents, of, commit, argue, that, it, implies, that, suicide, is, criminal, sinful, or, morally, wrong, there, is, no, known, unifying, underlying, pathophysiology, for, suicide, it, is, believed, to, result, from, an, interplay, of, behavioral, socio, economic, and, psychological, factors, low, levels, of, brain, derived, neurotrophic, factor, bdnf, are, both, directly, associated, with, suicide, and, indirectly, associated, through, its, role, in, major, depression, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, schizophrenia, and, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, post, mortem, studies, have, found, reduced, levels, of, bdnf, in, the, hippocampus, and, prefrontal, cortex, in, those, with, and, without, psychiatric, conditions, serotonin, a, brain, neurotransmitter, is, believed, to, be, low, in, those, who, die, by, suicide, this, is, partly, based, on, evidence, of, increased, levels, of, 5, ht2a, receptors, found, after, death, other, evidence, includes, reduced, levels, of, a, breakdown, product, of, serotonin, 5, hydroxyindoleacetic, acid, in, the, cerebral, spinal, fluid, however, direct, evidence, is, hard, to, obtain, epigenetics, the, study, of, changes, in, genetic, expression, in, response, to, environmental, factors, which, do, not, alter, the, underlying, dna, is, also, believed, to, play, a, role, in, determining, suicide, risk, factors, that, affect, the, risk, of, suicide, include, mental, disorders, drug, misuse, psychological, states, cultural, family, and, social, situations, genetics, experiences, of, trauma, or, loss, and, nihilism, mental, disorders, and, substance, misuse, frequently, co, exist, other, risk, factors, include, having, previously, attempted, suicide, the, ready, availability, of, a, means, to, take, one, s, life, a, family, history, of, suicide, or, the, presence, of, traumatic, brain, injury, for, example, suicide, rates, have, been, found, to, be, greater, in, households, with, firearms, than, those, without, them, socio, economic, problems, such, as, unemployment, poverty, homelessness, and, discrimination, may, trigger, suicidal, thoughts, suicide, might, be, rarer, in, societies, with, high, social, cohesion, and, moral, objections, against, suicide, genetics, appears, to, account, for, between, 38, and, 55, of, suicidal, behaviors, suicides, may, also, occur, as, a, local, cluster, of, cases, most, research, does, not, distinguish, between, risk, factors, that, lead, to, thinking, about, suicide, and, risk, factors, that, lead, to, suicide, attempts, risks, for, suicide, attempt, rather, than, just, thoughts, of, suicide, include, a, high, pain, tolerance, and, a, reduced, fear, of, death, a, previous, history, of, suicide, attempts, is, the, most, accurate, predictor, of, death, by, suicide, approximately, 20, of, suicides, have, had, a, previous, attempt, of, those, who, have, attempted, suicide, 1, die, by, suicide, within, a, year, and, more, than, 5, die, by, suicide, within, 10, years, mental, illness, is, present, at, the, time, of, suicide, 27, to, more, than, 90, of, the, time, of, those, who, have, been, hospitalized, for, suicidal, behavior, the, lifetime, risk, of, suicide, is, 8, 6, comparatively, non, suicidal, people, hospitalized, for, affective, disorders, have, a, 4, lifetime, risk, of, suicide, half, of, all, people, who, die, by, suicide, may, have, major, depressive, disorder, having, this, or, one, of, the, other, mood, disorders, such, as, bipolar, disorder, increases, the, risk, of, suicide, 20, fold, other, conditions, implicated, include, schizophrenia, 14, personality, disorders, 8, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, and, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, those, with, autism, also, attempt, and, consider, suicide, more, frequently, others, estimate, that, about, half, of, people, who, die, by, suicide, could, be, diagnosed, with, a, personality, disorder, with, borderline, personality, disorder, being, the, most, common, about, 5, of, people, with, schizophrenia, die, of, suicide, eating, disorders, are, another, high, risk, condition, around, 22, to, 50, of, people, with, gender, dysphoria, have, attempted, suicide, however, this, greatly, varies, by, region, among, approximately, 80, of, suicides, the, individual, has, seen, a, physician, within, the, year, before, their, death, including, 45, within, the, prior, month, approximately, 25, 40, of, those, who, died, by, suicide, had, contact, with, mental, health, services, in, the, prior, year, antidepressants, of, the, ssri, class, appear, to, increase, the, frequency, of, suicide, among, children, and, young, persons, an, unwillingness, to, get, help, for, mental, health, problems, also, increases, the, risk, substance, misuse, is, the, second, most, common, risk, factor, for, suicide, after, major, depression, and, bipolar, disorder, both, chronic, substance, misuse, as, well, as, acute, intoxication, are, associated, when, combined, with, personal, grief, such, as, bereavement, the, risk, is, further, increased, substance, misuse, is, also, associated, with, mental, health, disorders, most, people, are, under, the, influence, of, sedative, hypnotic, drugs, such, as, alcohol, or, benzodiazepines, when, they, die, by, suicide, with, alcoholism, present, in, between, 15, and, 61, of, cases, use, of, prescribed, benzodiazepines, is, associated, with, an, increased, rate, of, suicide, and, attempted, suicide, the, pro, suicidal, effects, of, benzodiazepines, are, suspected, to, be, due, to, a, psychiatric, disturbance, caused, by, side, effects, such, as, disinhibition, or, withdrawal, symptoms, countries, that, have, higher, rates, of, alcohol, use, and, a, greater, density, of, bars, generally, also, have, higher, rates, of, suicide, about, 2, 2, 3, 4, of, those, who, have, been, treated, for, alcoholism, at, some, point, in, their, life, die, by, suicide, alcoholics, who, attempt, suicide, are, usually, male, older, and, have, tried, to, take, their, own, lives, in, the, past, between, 3, and, 35, of, deaths, among, those, who, use, heroin, are, due, to, suicide, approximately, fourteenfold, greater, than, those, who, do, not, use, in, adolescents, who, misuse, alcohol, neurological, and, psychological, dysfunctions, may, contribute, to, the, increased, risk, of, suicide, the, misuse, of, cocaine, and, methamphetamine, has, a, high, correlation, with, suicide, in, those, who, use, cocaine, the, risk, is, greatest, during, the, withdrawal, phase, those, who, used, inhalants, are, also, at, significant, risk, with, around, 20, attempting, suicide, at, some, point, and, more, than, 65, considering, it, smoking, cigarettes, is, associated, with, risk, of, suicide, there, is, little, evidence, as, to, why, this, association, exists, however, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, those, who, are, predisposed, to, smoking, are, also, predisposed, to, suicide, that, smoking, causes, health, problems, which, subsequently, make, people, want, to, end, their, life, and, that, smoking, affects, brain, chemistry, causing, a, propensity, for, suicide, cannabis, however, does, not, appear, to, independently, increase, the, risk, non, suicidal, self, harm, is, common, with, 18, of, people, engaging, in, self, harm, over, the, course, of, their, life, 1, acts, of, self, harm, are, not, usually, suicide, attempts, and, most, who, self, harm, are, not, at, high, risk, of, suicide, some, who, self, harm, however, do, still, end, their, life, by, suicide, and, risk, for, self, harm, and, suicide, may, overlap, individuals, who, have, been, identified, as, self, harming, after, being, admitted, to, hospital, are, 68, 38, 105, more, likely, to, die, by, suicide, 279, there, is, an, association, between, suicidality, and, physical, health, problems, such, as, chronic, pain, traumatic, brain, injury, cancer, chronic, fatigue, syndrome, kidney, failure, requiring, hemodialysis, hiv, and, systemic, lupus, erythematosus, the, diagnosis, of, cancer, approximately, doubles, the, subsequent, frequency, of, suicide, the, prevalence, of, increased, suicidality, persisted, after, adjusting, for, depressive, illness, and, alcohol, abuse, among, people, with, more, than, one, medical, condition, the, frequency, was, particularly, high, in, japan, health, problems, are, listed, as, the, primary, justification, for, suicide, sleep, disturbances, such, as, insomnia, and, sleep, apnea, are, risk, factors, for, depression, and, suicide, in, some, instances, the, sleep, disturbances, may, be, a, risk, factor, independent, of, depression, a, number, of, other, medical, conditions, may, present, with, symptoms, similar, to, mood, disorders, including, hypothyroidism, alzheimer, s, brain, tumors, systemic, lupus, erythematosus, and, adverse, effects, from, a, number, of, medications, such, as, beta, blockers, and, steroids, a, number, of, psychological, factors, increase, the, risk, of, suicide, including, hopelessness, loss, of, pleasure, in, life, depression, anxiousness, agitation, rigid, thinking, rumination, thought, suppression, and, poor, coping, skills, a, poor, ability, to, solve, problems, the, loss, of, abilities, one, used, to, have, and, poor, impulse, control, also, play, a, role, in, older, adults, the, perception, of, being, a, burden, to, others, is, important, those, who, have, never, married, are, also, at, greater, risk, recent, life, stresses, such, as, a, loss, of, a, family, member, or, friend, or, the, loss, of, a, job, might, be, a, contributing, factor, certain, personality, factors, especially, high, levels, of, neuroticism, and, introvertedness, have, been, associated, with, suicide, this, might, lead, to, people, who, are, isolated, and, sensitive, to, distress, to, be, more, likely, to, attempt, suicide, on, the, other, hand, optimism, has, been, shown, to, have, a, protective, effect, other, psychological, risk, factors, include, having, few, reasons, for, living, and, feeling, trapped, in, a, stressful, situation, changes, to, the, stress, response, system, in, the, brain, might, be, altered, during, suicidal, states, specifically, changes, in, the, polyamine, system, and, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, social, isolation, and, the, lack, of, social, support, has, been, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, suicide, poverty, is, also, a, factor, with, heightened, relative, poverty, compared, to, those, around, a, person, increasing, suicide, risk, over, 200, 000, farmers, in, india, have, died, by, suicide, since, 1997, partly, due, to, issues, of, debt, in, china, suicide, is, three, times, as, likely, in, rural, regions, as, urban, ones, partly, it, is, believed, due, to, financial, difficulties, in, this, area, of, the, country, being, religious, may, reduce, one, s, risk, of, suicide, while, beliefs, that, suicide, is, noble, may, increase, it, this, has, been, attributed, to, the, negative, stance, many, religions, take, against, suicide, and, to, the, greater, connectedness, religion, may, give, muslims, among, religious, people, appear, to, have, a, lower, rate, of, suicide, however, the, data, supporting, this, is, not, strong, there, does, not, appear, to, be, a, difference, in, rates, of, attempted, suicide, young, women, in, the, middle, east, may, have, higher, rates, certain, occupations, carry, an, elevated, risk, of, self, harm, and, suicide, such, as, military, careers, research, in, several, countries, has, found, that, the, rate, of, suicide, among, former, armed, forces, personnel, in, particular, and, young, veterans, especially, is, markedly, higher, than, that, found, in, the, general, population, war, veterans, have, a, higher, risk, of, suicide, due, in, part, to, higher, rates, of, mental, illness, such, as, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, and, physical, health, problems, related, to, war, the, media, including, the, internet, plays, an, important, role, certain, depictions, of, suicide, may, increase, its, occurrence, with, high, volume, prominent, repetitive, coverage, glorifying, or, romanticizing, suicide, having, the, most, impact, for, example, about, 15, 40, of, people, leave, a, suicide, note, and, media, are, discouraged, from, reporting, the, contents, of, that, message, when, detailed, descriptions, of, how, to, kill, oneself, by, a, specific, means, are, portrayed, this, method, of, suicide, can, be, imitated, in, vulnerable, people, this, phenomenon, has, been, observed, in, several, cases, after, press, coverage, in, a, bid, to, reduce, the, adverse, effect, of, media, portrayals, concerning, suicide, report, one, of, the, effective, methods, is, to, educate, journalists, on, how, to, report, suicide, news, in, a, manner, that, might, reduce, that, possibility, of, imitation, and, encourage, those, at, risk, to, seek, for, help, when, journalists, follow, certain, reporting, guidelines, the, risk, of, suicides, can, be, decreased, getting, buy, in, from, the, media, industry, however, can, be, difficult, especially, in, the, long, term, this, trigger, of, suicide, contagion, or, copycat, suicide, is, known, as, the, werther, effect, named, after, the, protagonist, in, goethe, s, the, sorrows, of, young, werther, who, killed, himself, and, then, was, emulated, by, many, admirers, of, the, book, this, risk, is, greater, in, adolescents, who, may, romanticize, death, it, appears, that, while, news, media, has, a, significant, effect, that, of, the, entertainment, media, is, equivocal, it, is, unclear, if, searching, for, information, about, suicide, on, the, internet, relates, to, the, risk, of, suicide, the, opposite, of, the, werther, effect, is, the, proposed, papageno, effect, in, which, coverage, of, effective, coping, mechanisms, may, have, a, protective, effect, the, term, is, based, upon, a, character, in, mozart, s, opera, the, magic, flute, fearing, the, loss, of, a, loved, one, he, had, planned, to, kill, himself, until, his, friends, helped, him, out, as, a, consequence, fictional, portrayals, of, suicide, showing, alternative, consequences, or, negative, consequences, might, have, a, preventive, effect, for, instance, fiction, might, normalize, mental, health, problems, and, encourage, help, seeking, some, environmental, exposures, including, air, pollution, intense, sunlight, sunlight, duration, hot, weather, and, high, altitude, are, associated, with, suicide, there, is, a, possible, association, between, short, term, pm, 10, exposure, and, suicide, these, factors, might, affect, certain, high, risk, individuals, more, than, others, the, time, of, year, may, also, affect, suicide, rates, there, appears, to, be, a, decrease, around, christmas, but, an, increase, in, rates, during, spring, and, summer, which, might, be, related, to, exposure, to, sunshine, another, study, found, that, the, risk, may, be, greater, for, males, on, their, birthday, genetics, might, influence, rates, of, suicide, a, family, history, of, suicide, especially, in, the, mother, affects, children, more, than, adolescents, or, adults, adoption, studies, have, shown, that, this, is, the, case, for, biological, relatives, but, not, adopted, relatives, this, makes, familial, risk, factors, unlikely, to, be, due, to, imitation, once, mental, disorders, are, accounted, for, the, estimated, heritability, rate, is, 36, for, suicidal, ideation, and, 17, for, suicide, attempts, an, evolutionary, explanation, for, suicide, is, that, it, may, improve, inclusive, fitness, this, may, occur, if, the, person, dying, by, suicide, cannot, have, more, children, and, takes, resources, away, from, relatives, by, staying, alive, an, objection, to, this, explanation, is, that, deaths, by, healthy, adolescents, likely, do, not, increase, inclusive, fitness, adaptation, to, a, very, different, ancestral, environment, may, be, maladaptive, in, the, current, one, trauma, is, a, risk, factor, for, suicidality, in, both, children, and, adults, some, may, take, their, own, lives, to, escape, bullying, or, prejudice, a, history, of, childhood, sexual, abuse, and, time, spent, in, foster, care, are, also, risk, factors, sexual, abuse, is, believed, to, contribute, to, approximately, 20, of, the, overall, risk, significant, adversity, early, in, life, has, a, negative, effect, on, problem, solving, skills, and, memory, both, of, which, are, implicated, in, suicidality, according, to, a, 2022, study, adverse, childhood, experiences, maybe, associated, with, a, two, fold, higher, odds, of, anxiety, disorders, depression, and, suicidality, problem, gambling, is, associated, with, increased, suicidal, ideation, and, attempts, compared, to, the, general, population, between, 12, and, 24, of, pathological, gamblers, attempt, suicide, the, rate, of, suicide, among, their, spouses, is, three, times, greater, than, that, of, the, general, population, other, factors, that, increase, the, risk, in, problem, gamblers, include, concomitant, mental, illness, alcohol, and, drug, misuse, infection, by, the, parasite, toxoplasma, gondii, more, commonly, known, as, toxoplasmosis, has, been, linked, with, suicide, risk, one, explanation, states, that, this, is, caused, by, altered, neurotransmitter, activity, due, to, the, immunological, response, rational, suicide, is, the, reasoned, taking, of, one, s, own, life, however, some, consider, suicide, as, never, being, rational, euthanasia, and, assisted, suicide, are, accepted, practices, in, a, number, of, countries, among, those, who, have, a, poor, quality, of, life, without, the, possibility, of, getting, better, they, are, supported, by, the, legal, arguments, for, a, right, to, die, the, act, of, taking, one, s, life, for, the, benefit, of, others, is, known, as, altruistic, suicide, an, example, of, this, is, an, elder, ending, his, or, her, life, to, leave, greater, amounts, of, food, for, the, younger, people, in, the, community, suicide, in, some, inuit, cultures, has, been, seen, as, an, act, of, respect, courage, or, wisdom, a, suicide, attack, is, a, political, or, religious, action, where, an, attacker, carries, out, violence, against, others, which, they, understand, will, result, in, their, own, death, some, suicide, bombers, are, motivated, by, a, desire, to, obtain, martyrdoms, or, are, religiously, motivated, kamikaze, missions, were, carried, out, as, a, duty, to, a, higher, cause, or, moral, obligation, murder, suicide, is, an, act, of, homicide, followed, within, a, week, by, suicide, of, the, person, who, carried, out, the, act, mass, suicides, are, often, performed, under, social, pressure, where, members, give, up, autonomy, to, a, leader, see, notable, cases, below, mass, suicides, can, take, place, with, as, few, as, two, people, often, referred, to, as, a, suicide, pact, in, extenuating, situations, where, continuing, to, live, would, be, intolerable, some, people, use, suicide, as, a, means, of, escape, some, inmates, in, nazi, concentration, camps, are, known, to, have, killed, themselves, during, the, holocaust, by, deliberately, touching, the, electrified, fences, suicide, prevention, is, a, term, used, for, the, collective, efforts, to, reduce, the, incidence, of, suicide, through, preventive, measures, protective, factors, for, suicide, include, support, and, access, to, therapy, about, 60, of, people, with, suicidal, thoughts, do, not, seek, help, reasons, for, not, doing, so, include, low, perceived, need, and, wanting, to, deal, with, the, problem, alone, despite, these, high, rates, there, are, few, established, treatments, available, for, suicidal, behavior, reducing, access, to, certain, methods, such, as, access, to, firearms, or, toxins, such, as, opioids, and, pesticides, can, reduce, risk, of, suicide, by, that, method, reducing, access, to, easily, accessible, methods, of, suicide, may, make, impulsive, attempts, less, likely, to, succeed, other, measures, include, reducing, access, to, charcoal, for, burning, and, adding, barriers, on, bridges, and, subway, platforms, treatment, of, drug, and, alcohol, addiction, depression, and, those, who, have, attempted, suicide, in, the, past, may, also, be, effective, some, have, proposed, reducing, access, to, alcohol, as, a, preventive, strategy, such, as, reducing, the, number, of, bars, in, young, adults, who, have, recently, thought, about, suicide, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, appears, to, improve, outcomes, school, based, programs, that, increase, mental, health, literacy, and, train, staff, have, shown, mixed, results, on, suicide, rates, economic, development, through, its, ability, to, reduce, poverty, may, be, able, to, decrease, suicide, rates, efforts, to, increase, social, connection, especially, in, elderly, males, may, be, effective, in, people, who, have, attempted, suicide, following, up, on, them, might, prevent, repeat, attempts, although, crisis,

firearms, these, differences, are, believed, to, be, in, part, due, to, availability, of, the, different, methods, a, review, of, 56, countries, found, that, hanging, was, the, most, common, method, in, most, of, the, countries, accounting, for, 53, of, male, suicides, and, 39, of, female, suicides, worldwide, 30, of, suicides, are, estimated, to, occur, from, pesticide, poisoning, most, of, which, occur, in, the, developing, world, the, use, of, this, method, varies, markedly, from, 4, in, europe, to, more, than, 50, in, the, pacific, region, it, is, also, common, in, latin, america, due, to, the, ease, of, access, within, the, farming, populations, in, many, countries, drug, overdoses, account, for, approximately, 60, of, suicides, among, women, and, 30, among, men, many, are,

use, of, firearms, with, this, method, being, somewhat, more, common, in, men, 56, than, women, 31, the, next, most, common, cause, was, hanging, in, males, 28, and, self, poisoning, in, females, 31, together, hanging, and, poisoning, constituted, about, 42, of, u, s, suicides, as, of, 2017, approximately, 1, 4, of, people, die, by, suicide, a, mortality, rate, of, 11, 6, per, 100, 000, persons, per, year, suicide, resulted, in, 842, 000, deaths, in, 2013, up, from, 712, 000, deaths, in, 1990, rates, of, suicide, have, increased, by, 60, from, the, 1960s, to, 2012, with, these, increases, seen, primarily, in, the, developing, world, globally, as, of, 2008, 2009, suicide, is, the, tenth, leading, cause, of, death, for, every, suicide, that, results, in, death, there, are, between, 10,

highest, rates, of, suicide, around, 75, of, suicides, occur, in, the, developing, world, the, countries, with, the, greatest, absolute, numbers, of, suicides, are, china, and, india, partly, due, to, their, large, population, size, accounting, for, over, half, the, total, in, china, suicide, is, the, 5th, leading, cause, of, death, an, unofficial, report, estimated, 5, 000, suicides, in, iran, in, 2022, globally, as, of, 2012, death, by, suicide, occurs, about, 1, 8, times, more, often, in, males, than, females, in, the, western, world, males, die, three, to, four, times, more, often, by, means, of, suicide, than, do, females, this, difference, is, even, more, pronounced, in, those, over, the, age, of, 65, with, tenfold, more, males, than, females, dying, by, suicide, suicide, attempts, and, self, harm, are, between, two, and, four, times, more, frequent, among, females, researchers, have, attributed, the, difference, between, suicide, and, attempted, suicide, among, the, sexes, to, males, using, more, lethal, means, to, end, their, lives, however, separating, intentional, suicide, attempts, from, non, suicidal, self, harm, is, not, currently, done, in, places, like, the, united, states, when, gathering, statistics, at, the, national, level, china, has, one, of, the, highest, female, suicide, rates, in, the, world, and, is, the, only, country, where, it, is, higher, than, that, of, men, ratio, of, 0, 9, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, suicide, rates, are, nearly, equivalent, between, males, and, females, the, highest, rate, of, female, suicide, is, found, in, south, korea, at, 22, per, 100, 000, with, high, rates, in, south, east, asia, and, the, western, pacific, generally, a, number, of, reviews, have, found, an, increased, risk, of, suicide, among, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and, transgender, people, among, transgender, persons, rates, of, attempted, suicide, are, about, 40, compared, to, a, general, population, rate, of, 5, this, is, believed, to, in, part, be, due, to, social, stigmatisation, in, many, countries, the, rate, of, suicide, is, highest, in, the, middle, aged, or, elderly, the, absolute, number, of, suicides, however, is, greatest, in, those, between, 15, and, 29, years, old, due, to, the, number, of, people, in, this, age, group, worldwide, the, average, age, of, suicide, is, between, age, 30, and, 49, for, both, men, and, women, suicidality, is, rare, in, children, but, increases, during, the, transition, to, adolescence, in, the, united, states, the, suicide, death, rate, is, greatest, in, caucasian, men, older, than, 80, years, even, though, younger, people, more, frequently, attempt, suicide, it, is, the, second, most, common, cause, of, death, in, adolescents, and, in, young, males, is, second, only, to, accidental, death, in, young, males, in, the, developed, world, it, is, the, cause, of, nearly, 30, of, mortality, in, the, developing, world, rates, are, similar, but, it, makes, up, a, smaller, proportion, of, overall, deaths, due, to, higher, rates, of, death, from, other, types, of, trauma, in, south, east, asia, in, contrast, to, other, areas, of, the, world, deaths, from, suicide, occur, at, a, greater, rate, in, young, females, than, elderly, females, in, ancient, athens, a, person, who, died, by, suicide, without, the, approval, of, the, state, was, denied, the, honors, of, a, normal, burial, the, person, would, be, buried, alone, on, the, outskirts, of, the, city, without, a, headstone, or, marker, it, was, also, common, for, the, hand, to, be, cut, off, the, body, and, buried, separately, the, hand, and, the, instrument, used, being, considered, the, perpetrator, however, it, was, deemed, to, be, an, acceptable, method, to, deal, with, military, defeat, in, ancient, rome, while, suicide, was, initially, permitted, it, was, later, deemed, a, crime, against, the, state, due, to, its, economic, costs, aristotle, condemned, all, forms, of, suicide, while, plato, was, ambivalent, in, rome, some, reasons, for, suicide, included, volunteering, death, in, a, gladiator, combat, guilt, over, murdering, someone, to, save, the, life, of, another, as, a, result, of, mourning, from, shame, from, being, raped, and, as, an, escape, from, intolerable, situations, like, physical, suffering, military, defeat, or, criminal, pursuit, suicide, came, to, be, regarded, as, a, sin, in, christian, europe, and, was, condemned, at, the, council, of, arles, 452, as, the, work, of, the, devil, in, the, middle, ages, the, church, had, drawn, out, discussions, as, to, when, the, desire, for, martyrdom, was, suicidal, as, in, the, case, of, martyrs, of, c, rdoba, despite, these, disputes, and, occasional, official, rulings, catholic, doctrine, was, not, entirely, settled, on, the, subject, of, suicide, until, the, later, 17th, century, a, criminal, ordinance, issued, by, louis, xiv, of, france, in, 1670, was, extremely, severe, even, for, the, times, the, dead, person, s, body, was, drawn, through, the, streets, face, down, and, then, hung, or, thrown, on, a, garbage, heap, additionally, all, of, the, person, s, property, was, confiscated, attitudes, towards, suicide, slowly, began, to, shift, during, the, renaissance, john, donne, s, work, biathanatos, contained, one, of, the, first, modern, defences, of, suicide, bringing, proof, from, the, conduct, of, biblical, figures, such, as, jesus, samson, and, saul, and, presenting, arguments, on, grounds, of, reason, and, nature, to, sanction, suicide, in, certain, circumstances, the, secularization, of, society, that, began, during, the, enlightenment, questioned, traditional, religious, attitudes, such, as, christian, views, on, suicide, toward, suicide, and, brought, a, more, modern, perspective, to, the, issue, david, hume, denied, that, suicide, was, a, crime, as, it, affected, no, one, and, was, potentially, to, the, advantage, of, the, individual, in, his, 1777, essays, on, suicide, and, the, immortality, of, the, soul, he, rhetorically, asked, why, should, i, prolong, a, miserable, existence, because, of, some, frivolous, advantage, which, the, public, may, perhaps, receive, from, me, hume, s, analysis, was, criticized, by, philosopher, philip, reed, as, being, uncharacteristically, for, him, bad, since, hume, took, an, unusually, narrow, conception, of, duty, and, his, conclusion, depended, upon, the, suicide, producing, no, harm, to, others, including, causing, no, grief, feelings, of, guilt, or, emotional, pain, to, any, surviving, friends, and, family, which, is, almost, never, the, case, a, shift, in, public, opinion, at, large, can, also, be, discerned, the, times, in, 1786, initiated, a, spirited, debate, on, the, motion, is, suicide, an, act, of, courage, by, the, 19th, century, the, act, of, suicide, had, shifted, from, being, viewed, as, caused, by, sin, to, being, caused, by, insanity, in, europe, although, suicide, remained, illegal, during, this, period, it, increasingly, became, the, target, of, satirical, comments, such, as, the, gilbert, and, sullivan, comic, opera, the, mikado, which, satirized, the, idea, of, executing, someone, who, had, already, killed, himself, by, 1879, english, law, began, to, distinguish, between, suicide, and, homicide, although, suicide, still, resulted, in, forfeiture, of, estate, in, 1882, the, deceased, were, permitted, daylight, burial, in, england, and, by, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, suicide, had, become, legal, in, much, of, the, western, world, the, term, suicide, first, emerged, shortly, before, 1700, to, replace, expressions, on, self, death, which, were, often, characterized, as, a, form, of, self, murder, in, the, west, suicide, is, a, crime, in, some, parts, of, the, world, no, country, in, europe, currently, considers, suicide, or, attempted, suicide, to, be, a, crime, it, was, however, in, most, western, european, countries, from, the, middle, ages, until, at, least, the, 19th, century, the, netherlands, was, the, first, country, to, legalize, both, physician, assisted, suicide, and, euthanasia, which, took, effect, in, 2002, although, only, doctors, are, allowed, to, assist, in, either, of, them, and, have, to, follow, a, protocol, prescribed, by, dutch, law, if, such, protocol, is, not, followed, it, is, an, offence, punishable, by, law, in, germany, active, euthanasia, is, illegal, and, anyone, present, during, suicide, may, be, prosecuted, for, failure, to, render, aid, in, an, emergency,

of, up, to, one, year, fined, or, both, there, are, ongoing, efforts, to, decriminalise, attempted, suicide, although, rights, groups, and, non, governmental, organisations, such, as, the, local, chapter, of, befrienders, say, that, progress, has, been, slow, proponents, of, decriminalisation, argue, that, suicide, legislation, may, deter, people, from, seeking, help, and, may, even,

of, the, middle, ages, such, as, st, augustine, and, st, thomas, aquinas, but, suicide, was, not, considered, a, sin, under, the, byzantine, christian, code, of, justinian, for, instance, in, catholic, and, orthodox, doctrine, suicide, is, considered, to, be, murder, violating, the, commandment, thou, shalt, not, kill, and, historically, neither, church, would, even, hold, a, burial, service, for, a, member, that, died, by, suicide, deeming, it, an, act, that, condemned, the, person, to, hell, since, they, died, in, a, state, of, mortal, sin, the, basic, idea, being, that, life, is, a, gift, given, by, god, which, should, not, be, spurned, and, that, suicide, is, against, the, natural, order, and, thus, interferes, with, god, s, master, plan, for, the, world, however, it, is, believed, that, mental, illness, or, grave, fear, of, suffering, diminishes, the, responsibility, of, the, one, completing, suicide, judaism, focuses, on, the, importance, of, valuing, this, life, and, as, such, suicide, is, tantamount, to, denying, god, s, goodness, in, the, world, despite, this, under, extreme, circumstances, when, there, has, seemed, no, choice, but, to, either, be, killed, or, forced, to, betray, their, religion, there, are, several, accounts, of, jews, having, died, by, suicide, either, individually, or, in, groups, see, holocaust, masada, first, french, persecution, of, the, jews, and, york, castle, for, examples, and, as, a, grim, reminder, there, is, even, a, prayer, in, the, jewish, liturgy, for, when, the, knife, is, at, the, throat, for, those, dying, to, sanctify, god, s, name, see, martyrdom, these, acts, have, received, mixed, responses, by, jewish, authorities, regarded, by, some, as, examples, of, heroic, martyrdom, while, others, state, that, it, was, wrong, for, them, to, take, their, own, lives, in, anticipation, of, martyrdom, islamic, religious, views, are, against, suicide, suiciding, is, haram, in, islam, the, quran, forbids, it, by,

who, suicides, and, succeeds, he, she, shall, never, enter, paradise, in, hinduism, suicide, is, generally, disdained, and, is, considered, equally, sinful, as, murdering, another, in, contemporary,

one, not, taken, one, s, own, life, however, hinduism, accepts, a, man, s, right, to, end, one, s, life, through, the, non, violent, practice, of, fasting, to, death, termed, prayopavesa, but, prayopavesa, is, strictly, restricted, to, people, who, have, no, desire, or, ambition, left, and, no, responsibilities, remaining, in, this, life, jainism, has, a, similar, practice, named, santhara, sati, or, self, immolation, by, widows, is, a, rare, and, illegal, practice, in, hindu, society, within, the, ainu, religion, someone, who, dies, by, suicide, is, believed, to, become, a, ghost, tukap, who, would, haunt, the, living, to, come, to, fulfillment, from, which, they, were, excluded, during, life, also, someone, who, insults, another, so, they, kill, themselves, is, regarded, as, co, responsible, for, their, death, according, to, norbert, richard, adami, this, ethic, exists, due, to, the, case, that, solidarity, within, the, community, is, much, more, important, to, ainu, culture, than, it, is, to, the, western, world, a, number, of, questions, are, raised, within, the, philosophy, of, suicide, including, what, constitutes, suicide, whether, or, not, suicide, can, be, a, rational, choice, and, the, moral, permissibility, of, suicide, arguments, as, to, acceptability, of, suicide, in, moral, or, social, terms, range, from, the, position, that, the, act, is, inherently, immoral, and, unacceptable, under, any, circumstances, to, a, regard, for, suicide, as, a, sacrosanct, right, of, anyone, who, believes, they, have, rationally, and, conscientiously, come, to, the, decision, to, end, their, own, lives, even, if, they, are, young, and, healthy, opponents, to, suicide, include, philosophers, such, as, augustine, of, hippo, thomas, aquinas, immanuel, kant, and, arguably, john, stuart, mill, mill, s, focus, on, the, importance, of, liberty, and, autonomy, meant, that, he, rejected, choices, which, would, prevent, a, person, from, making, future,
