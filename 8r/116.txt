in, amniotes, the, clitoris, k, l, t, r, s, klit, r, iss, or, k, l, t, r, s, klih, tor, iss, pl, clitorises, or, clitorides, is, a, female, sex, organ, in, humans, it, is, the, vulva, s, most, erogenous, area, and, generally, the, primary, anatomical, source, of, female, sexual, pleasure, the, clitoris, is, a, complex, structure, and, its, size, and, sensitivity, can, vary, the, visible, portion, the, glans, of, the, clitoris, is, typically, roughly, the, size, and, shape, of, a, pea, and, is, estimated, to, have, at, least, 8, 000, nerve, endings, sexological, medical, and, psychological, debate, has, focused, on, the, clitoris, and, it, has, been, subject, to, social, constructionist, analyses, and, studies, such, discussions, range, from, anatomical, accuracy, gender, inequality, female, genital, mutilation, and, orgasmic, factors, and, their, physiological, explanation, for, the, g, spot, the, only, known, purpose, of, the, human, clitoris, is, to, provide, sexual, pleasure, knowledge, of, the, clitoris, is, significantly, affected, by, its, cultural, perceptions, studies, suggest, that, knowledge, of, its, existence, and, anatomy, is, scant, in, comparison, with, that, of, other, sexual, organs, especially, male, sex, organs, and, that, more, education, about, it, could, help, alleviate, stigmas, such, as, the, idea, that, the, clitoris, and, vulva, in, general, are, visually, unappealing, or, that, female, masturbation, is, taboo, and, disgraceful, the, clitoris, is, homologous, to, the, penis, in, males, the, oxford, english, dictionary, states, that, the, neo, latin, word, cl, toris, likely, has, its, origin, in, the, ancient, greek, kleitor, s, which, means, little, hill, and, perhaps, derived, from, the, verb, kle, ein, meaning, to, shut, or, to, sheathe, clitoris, is, also, related, to, the, greek, word, kle, s, key, indicating, that, the, ancient, anatomists, considered, it, the, key, to, female, sexuality, in, addition, the, online, etymology, dictionary, suggests, other, greek, candidates, for, this, word, s, etymology, include, a, noun, meaning, latch, or, hook, or, a, verb, meaning, to, touch, or, titillate, lasciviously, to, tickle, the, oxford, english, dictionary, also, states, that, the, colloquially, shortened, form, clit, the, first, occurrence, of, which, was, noted, in, the, united, states, has, been, used, in, print, since, 1958, until, then, the, common, abbreviation, was, clitty, other, slang, terms, for, clitoris, are, bean, nub, and, love, button, the, term, clitoris, is, commonly, used, to, refer, to, the, glans, alone, in, recent, anatomical, works, the, clitoris, has, also, been, referred, to, as, the, bulbo, clitoral, organ, most, of, the, clitoris, is, composed, of, internal, parts, regarding, humans, it, consists, of, the, glans, the, body, which, is, composed, of, two, erectile, structures, known, as, the, corpora, cavernosa, the, prepuce, and, the, root, the, frenulum, is, beneath, the, glans, research, indicates, that, clitoral, tissue, extends, into, the, vaginal, anterior, wall, enayl, et, al, said, that, the, histological, evaluation, of, the, clitoris, especially, of, the, corpora, cavernosa, is, incomplete, because, for, many, years, the, clitoris, was, considered, a, rudimentary, and, nonfunctional, organ, they, added, that, baskin, and, colleagues, examined, the, clitoris, masculinization, after, dissection, and, using, imaging, software, after, masson, s, trichrome, staining, put, the, serial, dissected, specimens, together, this, revealed, that, nerves, surround, the, whole, clitoral, body, the, clitoris, its, bulbs, labia, minora, and, urethra, involve, two, histologically, distinct, types, of, vascular, tissue, tissue, related, to, blood, vessels, the, first, of, which, is, trabeculated, erectile, tissue, innervated, by, the, cavernous, nerves, the, trabeculated, tissue, has, a, spongy, appearance, along, with, blood, it, fills, the, large, dilated, vascular, spaces, of, the, clitoris, and, the, bulbs, beneath, the, epithelium, of, the, vascular, areas, is, smooth, muscle, as, indicated, by, yang, et, al, s, research, it, may, also, be, that, the, urethral, lumen, the, inner, open, space, or, cavity, of, the, urethra, which, is, surrounded, by, a, spongy, tissue, has, tissue, that, is, grossly, distinct, from, the, vascular, tissue, of, the, clitoris, and, bulbs, and, on, macroscopic, observation, is, paler, than, the, dark, tissue, of, the, clitoris, and, bulbs, the, second, type, of, vascular, tissue, is, non, erectile, which, may, consist, of, blood, vessels, that, are, dispersed, within, a, fibrous, matrix, and, have, only, a, minimal, amount, of, smooth, muscle, highly, innervated, the, clitoral, glans, glans, means, acorn, in, latin, also, known, as, the, head, or, tip, exists, at, the, top, of, the, clitoral, body, as, a, fibro, vascular, cap, and, is, usually, the, size, and, shape, of, a, pea, although, it, is, sometimes, much, larger, or, smaller, the, glans, is, separated, from, the, clitoral, body, by, a, ridge, of, tissue, called, the, corona, the, clitoral, glans, is, estimated, to, have, 8, 000, and, possibly, 10, 000, or, more, sensory, nerve, endings, making, it, the, most, sensitive, erogenous, zone, the, glans, also, has, numerous, genital, corpuscles, research, conflicts, on, whether, the, glans, is, composed, of, erectile, or, non, erectile, tissue, some, sources, describe, the, clitoral, glans, and, labia, minora, as, composed, of, non, erectile, tissue, this, is, especially, the, case, for, the, glans, they, state, that, the, clitoral, glans, and, labia, minora, have, blood, vessels, that, are, dispersed, within, a, fibrous, matrix, and, have, only, a, minimal, amount, of, smooth, muscle, or, that, the, clitoral, glans, is, a, midline, densely, neural, non, erectile, structure, the, clitoral, glans, is, homologous, to, the, male, penile, glans, other, descriptions, of, the, glans, assert, that, it, is, composed, of, erectile, tissue, and, that, erectile, tissue, is, present, within, the, labia, minora, the, glans, may, be, noted, as, having, glandular, vascular, spaces, that, are, not, as, prominent, as, those, in, the, clitoral, body, with, the, spaces, being, separated, more, by, smooth, muscle, than, in, the, body, and, crura, adipose, tissue, is, absent, in, the, labia, minora, but, the, organ, may, be, described, as, being, made, up, of, dense, connective, tissue, erectile, tissue, and, elastic, fibers, the, clitoral, frenulum, or, frenum, frenulum, clitoridis, and, crus, glandis, clitoridis, in, latin, the, former, meaning, little, bridle, is, a, medial, band, of, tissue, formed, between, the, undersurface, of, the, glans, and, the, top, ends, of, the, labia, minora, it, is, homologous, to, the, penile, frenulum, in, males, the, frenulum, s, main, function, is, to, maintain, the, clitoris, in, its, innate, position, the, clitoral, body, also, known, as, the, shaft, of, the, clitoris, is, a, portion, behind, the, glans, that, contains, the, union, of, the, corpora, cavernosa, a, pair, of, sponge, like, regions, of, erectile, tissue, that, hold, most, of, the, blood, in, the, clitoris, during, erection, it, is, homologous, to, the, penile, shaft, in, the, male, the, two, corpora, forming, the, clitoral, body, are, surrounded, by, thick, fibro, elastic, tunica, albuginea, a, sheath, of, connective, tissue, these, corpora, are, separated, incompletely, from, each, other, in, the, midline, by, a, fibrous, pectiniform, septum, a, comblike, band, of, connective, tissue, extending, between, the, corpora, cavernosa, the, clitoral, body, is, also, connected, to, the, pubic, symphysis, by, the, suspensory, ligament, the, body, of, the, clitoris, is, a, bent, shape, which, makes, the, clitoral, angle, or, elbow, the, angle, divides, the, body, into, the, ascending, part, internal, near, the, pubic, symphysis, and, the, descending, part, external, which, can, be, seen, and, felt, through, the, clitoral, hood, lying, in, the, perineum, space, between, the, vulva, and, anus, and, within, the, superficial, perineal, pouch, is, the, root, of, the, clitoris, which, consists, of, the, posterior, ends, of, the, clitoris, the, crura, and, the, bulbs, of, vestibule, the, crura, legs, are, the, parts, of, the, corpora, cavernosa, extending, from, the, clitoral, body, and, form, an, upside, down, v, shape, each, crus, singular, form, of, crura, is, attached, to, the, corresponding, ischial, ramus, extensions, of, the, corpora, beneath, the, descending, pubic, rami, concealed, behind, the, labia, minora, the, crura, end, with, attachment, at, or, just, below, the, middle, of, the, pubic, arch, associated, are, the, urethral, sponge, perineal, sponge, a, network, of, nerves, and, blood, vessels, the, suspensory, ligament, of, the, clitoris, muscles, and, the, pelvic, floor, the, vestibular, bulbs, are, more, closely, related, to, the, clitoris, than, the, vestibule, because, of, the, similarity, of, the, trabecular, and, erectile, tissue, within, the, clitoris, and, its, bulbs, and, the, absence, of, trabecular, tissue, in, other, parts, of, the, vulva, with, the, erectile, tissue, s, trabecular, nature, allowing, engorgement, and, expansion, during, sexual, arousal, the, vestibular, bulbs, are, typically, described, as, lying, close, to, the, crura, on, either, side, of, the, vaginal, opening, internally, they, are, beneath, the, labia, majora, the, anterior, sections, of, the, bulbs, unite, to, create, the, bulbar, commissure, which, forms, a, long, strip, of, erectile, tissue, dubbed, the, infra, corporeal, residual, spongy, part, rsp, that, expands, from, the, ventral, shaft, and, terminates, as, the, glans, the, rsp, is, also, connected, to, the, shaft, via, the, pars, intermedia, venous, plexus, of, kobelt, when, engorged, with, blood, the, bulbs, cuff, the, vaginal, opening, and, cause, the, vulva, to, expand, outward, although, several, texts, state, that, they, surround, the, vaginal, opening, ginger, et, al, state, that, this, does, not, appear, to, be, the, case, and, tunica, albuginea, does, not, envelop, the, erectile, tissue, of, the, bulbs, in, yang, et, al, s, assessment, of, the, bulbs, anatomy, they, conclude, that, the, bulbs, arch, over, the, distal, urethra, outlining, what, might, be, appropriately, called, the, bulbar, urethra, in, women, the, clitoral, hood, or, prepuce, projects, at, the, front, of, the, labia, commissure, where, the, edges, of, the, labia, majora, meet, at, the, base, of, the, pubic, mound, it, is, partially, formed, by, fusion, of, the, upper, labia, minora, the, hood, s, function, is, to, cover, and, protect, the, glans, and, external, shaft, there, is, considerable, variation, in, how, much, of, the, glans, protrudes, from, the, hood, and, how, much, is, covered, by, it, ranging, from, completely, covered, to, fully, exposed, and, tissue, of, the, labia, minora, also, encircles, the, base, of, the, glans, there, is, no, identified, correlation, between, the, size, of, the, glans, or, clitoris, as, a, whole, and, a, woman, s, age, height, weight, use, of, hormonal, contraception, or, being, postmenopausal, although, women, who, have, given, birth, may, have, significantly, larger, clitoral, measurements, centimetre, and, millimetre, measurements, of, the, clitoris, show, variations, in, size, the, clitoral, glans, has, been, cited, as, typically, varying, from, 2, mm, to, 1, cm, less, than, an, inch, and, usually, being, estimated, at, 4, to, 5, mm, in, both, the, transverse, and, longitudinal, planes, a, 1992, study, concluded, that, the, total, clitoral, length, including, glans, and, body, is, 16, 0, 4, 3, mm, 0, 63, 0, 17, in, where, 16, mm, 0, 63, in, is, the, mean, and, 4, 3, mm, 0, 17, in, is, the, standard, deviation, concerning, other, studies, researchers, from, the, elizabeth, garrett, anderson, and, obstetric, hospital, in, london, measured, the, labia, and, other, genital, structures, of, 50, women, from, the, age, of, 18, to, 50, with, a, mean, age, of, 35, 6, from, 2003, to, 2004, and, the, results, given, for, the, clitoral, glans, were, 3, 10, mm, for, the, range, and, 5, 5, mm, for, the, mean, other, research, indicates, that, the, clitoral, body, can, measure, 5, 7, centimetres, 2, 0, 2, 8, in, in, length, while, the, clitoral, body, and, crura, together, can, be, 10, centimetres, 3, 9, in, or, more, in, length, the, clitoris, develops, from, a, phallic, outgrowth, in, the, embryo, called, the, genital, tubercle, in, the, absence, of, testosterone, the, genital, tubercle, allows, for, the, formation, of, the, clitoris, the, initially, rapid, growth, of, the, phallus, gradually, slows, and, the, body, and, glans, of, the, clitoris, are, formed, along, with, its, other, structures, the, clitoris, has, an, abundance, of, nerve, endings, and, is, the, human, female, s, most, erogenous, part, of, the, body, when, sexually, stimulated, it, may, incite, sexual, arousal, which, may, result, from, mental, stimulation, sexual, fantasy, activity, with, a, sexual, partner, or, masturbation, and, can, lead, to, orgasm, the, most, effective, sexual, stimulation, of, this, organ, is, usually, manually, or, orally, which, is, often, referred, to, as, direct, clitoral, stimulation, in, cases, involving, sexual, penetration, these, activities, may, also, be, referred, to, as, additional, or, assisted, clitoral, stimulation, direct, stimulation, involves, physical, stimulation, to, the, external, anatomy, of, the, clitoris, glans, hood, and, shaft, stimulation, of, the, labia, minora, due, to, it, being, connected, with, the, glans, and, hood, may, have, the, same, effect, as, direct, clitoral, stimulation, though, these, areas, may, also, receive, indirect, physical, stimulation, during, sexual, activity, such, as, when, in, friction, with, the, labia, majora, indirect, clitoral, stimulation, is, more, commonly, attributed, to, penile, vaginal, penetration, penile, anal, penetration, may, also, indirectly, stimulate, the, clitoris, by, the, shared, sensory, nerves, especially, the, pudendal, nerve, which, gives, off, the, inferior, anal, nerves, and, divides, into, two, terminal, branches, the, perineal, nerve, and, the, dorsal, nerve, of, the, clitoris, due, to, the, glans, high, sensitivity, direct, stimulation, to, it, is, not, always, pleasurable, instead, direct, stimulation, to, the, hood, or, near, the, glans, is, often, more, pleasurable, with, the, majority, of, women, preferring, to, use, the, hood, to, stimulate, the, glans, or, to, have, the, glans, rolled, between, the, labia, for, indirect, touch, it, is, also, common, for, women, to, enjoy, the, shaft, being, softly, caressed, in, concert, with, the, occasional, circling, of, the, glans, this, might, be, with, or, without, digital, penetration, of, the, vagina, while, other, women, enjoy, having, the, entire, vulva, caressed, as, opposed, to, the, use, of, dry, fingers, stimulation, from, well, lubricated, fingers, either, by, vaginal, lubrication, or, a, personal, lubricant, is, usually, more, pleasurable, for, the, external, clitoris, as, the, clitoris, external, location, does, not, allow, for, direct, stimulation, by, penetration, any, external, clitoral, stimulation, while, in, the, missionary, position, usually, results, from, the, pubic, bone, area, as, such, some, couples, may, engage, in, the, woman, on, top, position, or, the, coital, alignment, technique, a, sex, position, combining, the, riding, high, variation, of, the, missionary, position, with, pressure, counterpressure, movements, performed, by, each, partner, in, rhythm, with, sexual, penetration, to, maximize, clitoral, stimulation, same, sex, female, couples, may, engage, in, tribadism, vulva, to, vulva, or, vulva, to, body, rubbing, for, ample, or, mutual, clitoral, stimulation, during, whole, body, contact, pressing, the, penis, in, a, gliding, or, circular, motion, against, the, clitoris, or, stimulating, it, by, the, movement, against, another, body, part, may, also, be, practiced, a, vibrator, such, as, a, clitoral, vibrator, dildo, or, other, sex, toy, may, be, used, other, women, stimulate, the, clitoris, by, use, of, a, pillow, or, other, inanimate, object, by, a, jet, of, water, from, the, faucet, of, a, bathtub, or, shower, or, by, closing, their, legs, and, rocking, during, sexual, arousal, the, clitoris, and, the, rest, of, the, vulva, engorge, and, change, color, as, the, erectile, tissues, fill, with, blood, vasocongestion, and, the, individual, experiences, vaginal, contractions, the, ischiocavernosus, and, bulbocavernosus, muscles, which, insert, into, the, corpora, cavernosa, contract, and, compress, the, dorsal, vein, of, the, clitoris, the, only, vein, that, drains, the, blood, from, the, spaces, in, the, corpora, cavernosa, and, the, arterial, blood, continues, a, steady, flow, and, having, no, way, to, drain, out, fills, the, venous, spaces, until, they, become, turgid, and, engorged, with, blood, this, is, what, leads, to, clitoral, erection, the, prepuce, has, retracted, and, the, glans, becomes, more, visible, the, glans, doubles, in, diameter, upon, arousal, and, further, stimulation, becomes, less, visible, as, it, is, covered, by, the, swelling, of, the, clitoral, hood, the, swelling, protects, the, glans, from, direct, contact, as, direct, contact, at, this, stage, can, be, more, irritating, than, pleasurable, vasocongestion, eventually, triggers, a, muscular, reflex, which, expels, the, blood, that, was, trapped, in, surrounding, tissues, and, leads, to, an, orgasm, a, short, time, after, stimulation, has, stopped, especially, if, orgasm, has, been, achieved, the, glans, becomes, visible, again, and, returns, to, its, normal, state, with, a, few, seconds, usually, 5, 10, to, return, to, its, normal, position, and, 5, 10, minutes, to, return, to, its, original, size, if, orgasm, is, not, achieved, the, clitoris, may, remain, engorged, for, a, few, hours, which, women, often, find, uncomfortable, additionally, the, clitoris, is, very, sensitive, after, orgasm, making, further, stimulation, initially, painful, for, some, women, general, statistics, indicate, that, 70, 80, percent, of, women, require, direct, clitoral, stimulation, consistent, manual, oral, or, other, concentrated, friction, against, the, external, parts, of, the, clitoris, to, reach, orgasm, indirect, clitoral, stimulation, for, example, by, means, of, vaginal, penetration, may, also, be, sufficient, for, female, orgasm, the, area, near, the, entrance, of, the, vagina, the, lower, third, contains, nearly, 90, percent, of, the, vaginal, nerve, endings, and, there, are, areas, in, the, anterior, vaginal, wall, and, between, the, top, junction, of, the, labia, minora, and, the, urinary, meatus, that, are, especially, sensitive, but, intense, sexual, pleasure, including, orgasm, solely, from, vaginal, stimulation, is, occasional, or, otherwise, absent, because, the, vagina, has, significantly, fewer, nerve, endings, than, the, clitoris, the, prominent, debate, over, the, quantity, of, vaginal, nerve, endings, began, with, alfred, kinsey, although, sigmund, freud, s, theory, that, clitoral, orgasms, are, a, prepubertal, or, adolescent, phenomenon, and, that, vaginal, or, g, spot, orgasms, are, something, that, only, physically, mature, females, experience, had, been, criticized, before, kinsey, was, the, first, researcher, to, harshly, criticize, the, theory, through, his, observations, of, female, masturbation, and, interviews, with, thousands, of, women, kinsey, found, that, most, of, the, women, he, observed, and, surveyed, could, not, have, vaginal, orgasms, a, finding, that, was, also, supported, by, his, knowledge, of, sex, organ, anatomy, scholar, janice, m, irvine, stated, that, he, criticized, freud, and, other, theorists, for, projecting, male, constructs, of, sexuality, onto, women, and, viewed, the, clitoris, as, the, main, center, of, sexual, response, he, considered, the, vagina, to, be, relatively, unimportant, for, sexual, satisfaction, relaying, that, few, women, inserted, fingers, or, objects, into, their, vaginas, when, they, masturbated, believing, that, vaginal, orgasms, are, a, physiological, impossibility, because, the, vagina, has, insufficient, nerve, endings, for, sexual, pleasure, or, climax, he, concluded, that, satisfaction, from, penile, penetration, mainly, psychological, or, perhaps, the, result, of, referred, sensation, masters, and, johnson, s, research, as, well, as, shere, hite, s, generally, supported, kinsey, s, findings, about, the, female, orgasm, masters, and, johnson, were, the, first, researchers, to, determine, that, the, clitoral, structures, surround, and, extend, along, and, within, the, labia, they, observed, that, both, clitoral, and, vaginal, orgasms, have, the, same, stages, of, physical, response, and, found, that, the, majority, of, their, subjects, could, only, achieve, clitoral, orgasms, while, a, minority, achieved, vaginal, orgasms, on, that, basis, they, argued, that, clitoral, stimulation, is, the, source, of, both, kinds, of, orgasms, reasoning, that, the, clitoris, is, stimulated, during, penetration, by, friction, against, its, hood, the, research, came, at, the, time, of, the, second, wave, feminist, movement, which, inspired, feminists, to, reject, the, distinction, made, between, clitoral, and, vaginal, orgasms, feminist, anne, koedt, argued, that, because, men, have, orgasms, essentially, by, friction, with, the, vagina, and, not, the, clitoral, area, this, is, why, women, s, biology, had, not, been, properly, analyzed, today, with, extensive, knowledge, of, anatomy, with, kinsey, and, masters, and, johnson, to, mention, just, a, few, sources, there, is, no, ignorance, on, the, subject, she, stated, in, her, 1970, article, the, myth, of, the, vaginal, orgasm, she, added, there, are, however, social, reasons, why, this, knowledge, has, not, been, popularized, we, are, living, in, a, male, society, which, has, not, sought, change, in, women, s, role, supporting, an, anatomical, relationship, between, the, clitoris, and, vagina, is, a, study, published, in, 2005, which, investigated, the, size, of, the, clitoris, australian, urologist, helen, o, connell, described, as, having, initiated, discourse, among, mainstream, medical, professionals, to, refocus, on, and, redefine, the, clitoris, noted, a, direct, relationship, between, the, legs, or, roots, of, the, clitoris, and, the, erectile, tissue, of, the, bulbs, and, corpora, and, the, distal, urethra, and, vagina, while, using, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, technology, while, some, studies, using, ultrasound, have, found, physiological, evidence, of, the, g, spot, in, women, who, report, having, orgasms, during, vaginal, intercourse, o, connell, argues, that, this, interconnected, relationship, is, the, physiological, explanation, for, the, conjectured, g, spot, and, experience, of, vaginal, orgasms, taking, into, account, the, stimulation, of, the, internal, parts, of, the, clitoris, during, vaginal, penetration, the, vaginal, wall, is, in, fact, the, clitoris, she, said, if, you, lift, the, skin, off, the, vagina, on, the, side, walls, you, get, the, bulbs, of, the, clitoris, triangular, crescental, masses, of, erectile, tissue, o, connell, et, al, having, performed, dissections, on, the, vulvas, of, cadavers, and, used, photography, to, map, the, structure, of, nerves, in, the, clitoris, made, the, assertion, in, 1998, that, there, is, more, erectile, tissue, associated, with, the, clitoris, than, is, generally, described, in, anatomical, textbooks, and, were, thus, already, aware, that, the, clitoris, is, more, than, just, its, glans, they, concluded, that, some, females, have, more, extensive, clitoral, tissues, and, nerves, than, others, especially, having, observed, this, in, young, cadavers, compared, to, elderly, ones, and, therefore, whereas, the, majority, of, females, can, only, achieve, orgasm, by, direct, stimulation, of, the, external, parts, of, the, clitoris, the, stimulation, of, the, more, generalized, tissues, of, the, clitoris, via, vaginal, intercourse, may, be, sufficient, for, others, french, researchers, odile, buisson, fr, and, pierre, fold, s, reported, similar, findings, to, that, of, o, connell, s, in, 2008, they, published, the, first, complete, 3d, sonography, of, the, stimulated, clitoris, and, republished, it, in, 2009, with, new, research, demonstrating, how, erectile, tissue, of, the, clitoris, engorges, and, surrounds, the, vagina, based, on, their, findings, they, argued, that, women, may, be, able, to, achieve, vaginal, orgasm, through, stimulation, of, the, g, spot, because, the, clitoris, is, pulled, closely, to, the, anterior, wall, of, the, vagina, when, the, woman, is, sexually, aroused, and, during, vaginal, penetration, they, assert, that, since, the, front, wall, of, the, vagina, is, inextricably, linked, with, the, internal, parts, of, the, clitoris, stimulating, the, vagina, without, activating, the, clitoris, may, be, next, to, impossible, in, their, 2009, published, study, it, states, the, coronal, planes, during, perineal, contraction, and, finger, penetration, demonstrated, a, close, relationship, between, the, root, of, the, clitoris, and, the, anterior, vaginal, wall, buisson, and, fold, s, suggested, that, the, special, sensitivity, of, the, lower, anterior, vaginal, wall, could, be, explained, by, pressure, and, movement, of, clitoris, root, during, a, vaginal, penetration, and, subsequent, perineal, contraction, researcher, vincenzo, puppo, who, while, agreeing, that, the, clitoris, is, the, center, of, female, sexual, pleasure, and, believing, that, there, is, no, anatomical, evidence, of, the, vaginal, orgasm, disagrees, with, o, connell, and, other, researchers, terminological, and, anatomical, descriptions, of, the, clitoris, such, as, referring, to, the, vestibular, bulbs, as, the, clitoral, bulbs, and, states, that, the, inner, clitoris, does, not, exist, because, the, penis, cannot, come, in, contact, with, the, congregation, of, multiple, nerves, veins, situated, until, the, angle, of, the, clitoris, detailed, by, georg, ludwig, kobelt, or, with, the, root, of, the, clitoris, which, does, not, have, sensory, receptors, or, erogenous, sensitivity, during, vaginal, intercourse, puppo, s, belief, contrasts, the, general, belief, among, researchers, that, vaginal, orgasms, are, the, result, of, clitoral, stimulation, they, reaffirm, that, clitoral, tissue, extends, or, is, at, least, stimulated, by, its, bulbs, even, in, the, area, most, commonly, reported, to, be, the, g, spot, the, g, spot, is, analogous, to, the, base, of, the, penis, and, has, additionally, been, theorized, with, the, sentiment, from, researcher, amichai, kilchevsky, that, because, female, fetal, development, is, the, default, state, in, the, absence, of, substantial, exposure, to, male, hormones, and, therefore, the, penis, is, essentially, a, clitoris, enlarged, by, such, hormones, there, is, no, evolutionary, reason, why, females, would, have, an, entity, in, addition, to, the, clitoris, that, can, produce, orgasms, the, general, difficulty, of, achieving, orgasms, vaginally, which, is, a, predicament, that, is, likely, due, to, nature, easing, the, process, of, childbearing, by, drastically, reducing, the, number, of, vaginal, nerve, endings, challenge, arguments, that, vaginal, orgasms, help, encourage, sexual, intercourse, to, facilitate, reproduction, supporting, a, distinct, g, spot, however, is, a, study, by, rutgers, university, published, in, 2011, which, was, the, first, to, map, the, female, genitals, onto, the, sensory, portion, of, the, brain, the, scans, indicated, that, the, brain, registered, distinct, feelings, between, stimulating, the, clitoris, the, cervix, and, the, vaginal, wall, where, the, g, spot, is, reported, to, be, when, several, women, stimulated, themselves, in, a, functional, magnetic, resonance, machine, barry, komisaruk, head, of, the, research, findings, stated, that, he, feels, that, the, bulk, of, the, evidence, shows, that, the, g, spot, is, not, a, particular, thing, and, that, it, is, a, region, it, s, a, convergence, of, many, different, structures, whether, the, clitoris, is, vestigial, an, adaptation, or, serves, a, reproductive, function, has, been, debated, geoffrey, miller, stated, that, helen, fisher, meredith, small, and, sarah, blaffer, hrdy, have, viewed, the, clitoral, orgasm, as, a, legitimate, adaptation, in, its, own, right, with, major, implications, for, female, sexual, behavior, and, sexual, evolution, like, lynn, margulis, and, natalie, angier, miller, believes, the, human, clitoris, shows, no, apparent, signs, of, having, evolved, directly, through, male, mate, choice, it, is, not, especially, large, brightly, colored, specifically, shaped, or, selectively, displayed, during, courtship, he, contrasts, this, with, other, female, species, that, have, clitorises, as, long, as, their, male, counterparts, he, said, the, human, clitoris, could, have, evolved, to, be, much, more, conspicuous, if, males, had, preferred, sexual, partners, with, larger, brighter, clitorises, and, that, its, inconspicuous, design, combined, with, its, exquisite, sensitivity, suggests, that, the, clitoris, is, important, not, as, an, object, of, male, mate, choice, but, as, a, mechanism, of, female, choice, while, miller, stated, that, male, scientists, such, as, stephen, jay, gould, and, donald, symons, have, viewed, the, female, clitoral, orgasm, as, an, evolutionary, side, effect, of, the, male, capacity, for, penile, orgasm, and, that, they, suggested, that, clitoral, orgasm, cannot, be, an, adaptation, because, it, is, too, hard, to, achieve, gould, acknowledged, that, most, female, orgasms, emanate, from, a, clitoral, rather, than, vaginal, or, some, other, site, and, that, his, nonadaptive, belief, has, been, widely, misunderstood, as, a, denial, of, either, the, adaptive, value, of, female, orgasm, in, general, or, even, as, a, claim, that, female, orgasms, lack, significance, in, some, broader, sense, he, said, that, although, he, accepts, that, clitoral, orgasm, plays, a, pleasurable, and, central, role, in, female, sexuality, and, its, joys, ll, these, favorable, attributes, however, emerge, just, as, clearly, and, just, as, easily, whether, the, clitoral, site, of, orgasm, arose, as, a, spandrel, or, an, adaptation, he, added, that, the, male, biologists, who, fretted, over, simply, assumed, that, a, deeply, vaginal, site, nearer, the, region, of, fertilization, would, offer, greater, selective, benefit, due, to, their, darwinian, summum, bonum, beliefs, about, enhanced, reproductive, success, similar, to, gould, s, beliefs, about, adaptionist, views, and, that, females, grow, nipples, as, adaptations, for, suckling, and, males, grow, smaller, unused, nipples, as, a, spandrel, based, upon, the, value, of, single, development, channels, american, philosopher, elisabeth, lloyd, suggested, that, there, is, little, evidence, to, support, an, adaptionist, account, of, female, orgasm, canadian, sexologist, meredith, l, chivers, stated, that, lloyd, views, female, orgasm, as, an, ontogenetic, leftover, women, have, orgasms, because, the, urogenital, neurophysiology, for, orgasm, is, so, strongly, selected, for, in, males, that, this, developmental, blueprint, gets, expressed, in, females, without, affecting, fitness, and, this, is, similar, to, males, hav, nipples, that, serve, no, fitness, related, function, at, the, 2002, conference, for, canadian, society, of, women, in, philosophy, nancy, tuana, argued, that, the, clitoris, is, unnecessary, in, reproduction, she, stated, that, it, has, been, ignored, because, of, a, fear, of, pleasure, it, is, pleasure, separated, from, reproduction, that, s, the, fear, she, reasoned, that, this, fear, causes, ignorance, which, veils, female, sexuality, o, connell, stated, it, boils, down, to, rivalry, between, the, sexes, the, idea, that, one, sex, is, sexual, and, the, other, reproductive, the, truth, is, that, both, are, sexual, and, both, are, reproductive, she, reiterated, that, the, vestibular, bulbs, appear, to, be, part, of, the, clitoris, and, that, the, distal, urethra, and, vagina, are, intimately, related, structures, although, they, are, not, erectile, in, character, forming, a, tissue, cluster, with, the, clitoris, that, appears, to, be, the, location, of, female, sexual, function, and, orgasm, genital, modification, may, be, for, aesthetic, medical, or, cultural, reasons, this, includes, female, genital, mutilation, fgm, sex, reassignment, surgery, for, trans, men, as, part, of, transitioning, intersex, surgery, and, genital, piercings, use, of, anabolic, steroids, by, bodybuilders, and, other, athletes, can, result, in, significant, enlargement, of, the, clitoris, along, with, other, masculinizing, effects, on, their, bodies, abnormal, enlargement, of, the, clitoris, may, be, referred, to, as, clitoromegaly, or, macroclitoris, but, clitoromegaly, is, more, commonly, seen, as, a, congenital, anomaly, of, the, genitalia, clitoroplasty, a, sex, reassignment, surgery, for, trans, women, involves, the, construction, of, a, clitoris, from, penile, tissue, people, taking, hormones, or, other, medications, as, part, of, a, gender, transition, usually, experience, dramatic, clitoral, growth, individual, desires, and, the, difficulties, of, phalloplasty, construction, of, a, penis, often, result, in, the, retention, of, the, original, genitalia, with, the, enlarged, clitoris, as, a, penis, analog, metoidioplasty, however, the, clitoris, cannot, reach, the, size, of, the, penis, through, hormones, a, surgery, to, add, function, to, the, clitoris, such, as, metoidioplasty, is, an, alternative, to, phalloplasty, that, permits, the, retention, of, sexual, sensation, in, the, clitoris, in, clitoridectomy, the, clitoris, may, be, removed, as, part, of, a, radical, vulvectomy, to, treat, cancer, such, as, vulvar, intraepithelial, neoplasia, however, modern, treatments, favor, more, conservative, approaches, as, invasive, surgery, can, have, psychosexual, consequences, clitoridectomy, more, often, involves, parts, of, the, clitoris, being, partially, or, completely, removed, during, fgm, which, may, be, additionally, known, as, female, circumcision, or, female, genital, cutting, fgc, removing, the, glans, does, not, mean, that, the, whole, structure, is, lost, since, the, clitoris, reaches, deep, into, the, genitals, in, reduction, clitoroplasty, a, common, intersex, surgery, the, glans, is, preserved, and, parts, of, the, erectile, bodies, are, excised, problems, with, this, technique, include, loss, of, sensation, loss, of, sexual, function, and, sloughing, of, the, glans, one, way, to, preserve, the, clitoris, with, its, innervations, and, function, is, to, imbricate, and, bury, the, glans, however, enayl, et, al, state, that, pain, during, stimulus, because, of, trapped, tissue, under, the, scarring, is, nearly, routine, in, another, method, 50, percent, of, the, ventral, clitoris, is, removed, through, the, level, base, of, the, clitoral, shaft, and, it, is, reported, that, good, sensation, and, clitoral, function, are, observed, in, follow, up, additionally, it, has, been, reported, that, the, complications, are, from, the, same, as, those, in, the, older, procedures, for, this, method, concerning, females, who, have, the, condition, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, the, largest, group, requiring, surgical, genital, correction, researcher, atilla, enayl, stated, the, main, expectations, for, the, operations, are, to, create, a, normal, female, anatomy, with, minimal, complications, and, improvement, of, life, quality, enayl, added, that, osmesis, structural, integrity, the, coital, capacity, of, the, vagina, and, absence, of, pain, during, sexual, activity, are, the, parameters, to, be, judged, by, the, surgeon, cosmesis, usually, refers, to, the, surgical, correction, of, a, disfiguring, defect, he, stated, that, although, expectations, can, be, standardized, within, these, few, parameters, operative, techniques, have, not, yet, become, homogeneous, investigators, have, preferred, different, operations, for, different, ages, of, patients, gender, assessment, and, surgical, treatment, are, the, two, main, steps, in, intersex, operations, the, first, treatments, for, clitoromegaly, were, simply, resection, of, the, clitoris, later, it, was, understood, that, the, clitoris, glans, and, sensory, input, are, important, to, facilitate, orgasm, stated, atilla, the, clitoral, glans, epithelium, has, high, cutaneous, sensitivity, which, is, important, in, sexual, responses, and, it, is, because, of, this, that, recession, clitoroplasty, was, later, devised, as, an, alternative, but, reduction, clitoroplasty, is, the, method, currently, performed, what, is, often, referred, to, as, a, clitoris, piercing, is, the, more, common, and, significantly, less, complicated, clitoral, hood, piercing, since, piercing, the, clitoris, is, difficult, and, very, painful, piercing, the, clitoral, hood, is, more, common, than, piercing, the, clitoral, shaft, or, glans, owing, to, the, small, percentage, of, people, who, are, anatomically, suited, for, it, clitoral, hood, piercings, are, usually, channeled, in, the, form, of, vertical, piercings, and, to, a, lesser, extent, horizontal, piercings, the, triangle, piercing, is, a, very, deep, horizontal, hood, piercing, and, is, done, behind, the, clitoris, as, opposed, to, in, front, of, it, for, styles, such, as, the, isabella, piercing, which, passes, through, the, clitoral, shaft, but, is, placed, deep, at, the, base, they, provide, unique, stimulation, and, still, require, the, proper, genital, build, the, isabella, starts, between, the, clitoral, glans, and, the, urethra, exiting, at, the, top, of, the, clitoral, hood, this, piercing, is, highly, risky, concerning, the, damage, that, may, occur, because, of, intersecting, nerves, see, clitoral, index, persistent, genital, arousal, disorder, pgad, results, in, spontaneous, persistent, and, uncontrollable, genital, arousal, in, women, unrelated, to, any, feelings, of, sexual, desire, clitoral, priapism, is, a, rare, potentially, painful, medical, condition, and, is, sometimes, described, as, an, aspect, of, pgad, with, pgad, arousal, lasts, for, an, unusually, extended, period, ranging, from, hours, to, days, it, can, also, be, associated, with, morphometric, and, vascular, modifications, of, the, clitoris, drugs, may, cause, or, affect, clitoral, priapism, the, drug, trazodone, is, known, to, cause, male, priapism, as, a, side, effect, but, there, is, only, one, documented, report, that, it, may, have, caused, clitoral, priapism, in, which, case, discontinuing, the, medication, may, be, a, remedy, additionally, nefazodone, is, documented, to, have, caused, clitoral, engorgement, as, distinct, from, clitoral, priapism, in, one, case, and, clitoral, priapism, can, sometimes, start, as, a, result, of, or, only, after, the, discontinuation, of, antipsychotics, or, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitors, ssris, because, pgad, is, relatively, rare, and, as, its, concept, apart, from, clitoral, priapism, has, only, been, researched, since, 2001, there, is, little, research, into, what, may, cure, or, remedy, the, disorder, in, some, recorded, cases, pgad, was, caused, by, or, caused, a, pelvic, arterial, venous, malformation, with, arterial, branches, to, the, clitoris, surgical, treatment, was, effective, in, these, cases, in, 2022, an, article, in, the, new, york, times, reported, several, instances, of, women, experiencing, reduced, clitoral, sensitivity, or, inability, to, orgasm, following, various, surgical, procedures, including, biopsies, of, the, vulva, pelvic, mesh, surgeries, sling, surgeries, and, labiaplasties, the, times, quoted, several, researchers, who, suggest, that, surgeons, lack, of, training, in, clitoral, anatomy, and, nerve, distribution, may, have, been, a, factor, as, it, is, part, of, the, vulva, the, clitoris, is, susceptible, to, pain, clitorodynia, from, various, conditions, such, as, sexually, transmitted, infections, and, pudendal, nerve, entrapment, the, clitoris, may, also, be, affected, by, vulvar, cancer, although, at, a, much, lower, rate, clitoral, phimosis, or, clitoral, adhesions, is, when, the, prepuce, cannot, be, retracted, limiting, exposure, of, the, glans, the, secretion, of, smegma, smegma, clitoridis, comes, from, the, apocrine, glands, of, the, clitoris, sweat, the, sebaceous, glands, of, the, clitoris, sebum, and, desquamating, epithelial, cells, concerning, historical, and, modern, perceptions, of, the, clitoris, the, clitoris, and, the, penis, were, considered, equivalent, by, some, scholars, for, more, than, 2, 500, years, in, all, respects, except, their, arrangement, due, to, it, being, frequently, omitted, from, or, misrepresented, in, historical, and, contemporary, anatomical, texts, it, was, also, subject, to, a, continual, cycle, of, male, scholars, claiming, to, have, discovered, it, the, ancient, greeks, ancient, romans, and, greek, and, roman, generations, up, to, and, throughout, the, renaissance, were, aware, that, male, and, female, sex, organs, are, anatomically, similar, but, prominent, anatomists, such, as, galen, and, vesalius, regarded, the, vagina, as, the, structural, equivalent, of, the, penis, except, for, being, inverted, vesalius, argued, against, the, existence, of, the, clitoris, in, normal, women, and, his, anatomical, model, described, how, the, penis, corresponds, with, the, vagina, without, a, role, for, the, clitoris, ancient, greek, and, roman, sexuality, additionally, designated, penetration, as, male, defined, sexuality, the, term, tribas, or, tribade, was, used, to, refer, to, a, woman, or, intersex, individual, who, actively, penetrated, another, person, male, or, female, through, the, use, of, the, clitoris, or, a, dildo, as, any, sexual, act, was, believed, to, require, that, one, of, the, partners, be, phallic, and, that, therefore, sexual, activity, between, women, was, impossible, without, this, feature, mythology, popularly, associated, lesbians, with, either, having, enlarged, clitorises, or, as, incapable, of, enjoying, sexual, activity, without, the, substitution, of, a, phallus, in, 1545, charles, estienne, was, the, first, writer, to, identify, the, clitoris, in, a, work, based, on, dissection, but, he, concluded, that, it, had, a, urinary, function, following, this, study, realdo, colombo, also, known, as, renaldus, columbus, a, lecturer, in, surgery, at, the, university, of, padua, italy, published, a, book, called, de, re, anatomica, in, 1559, in, which, he, describes, the, seat, of, woman, s, delight, in, his, role, as, researcher, colombo, concluded, since, no, one, has, discerned, these, projections, and, their, workings, if, it, is, permissible, to, give, names, to, things, discovered, by, me, it, should, be, called, the, love, or, sweetness, of, venus, about, the, mythological, venus, goddess, of, erotic, love, colombo, s, claim, was, disputed, by, his, successor, at, padua, gabriele, falloppio, discoverer, of, the, fallopian, tube, who, claimed, that, he, was, the, first, to, discover, the, clitoris, in, 1561, falloppio, stated, modern, anatomists, have, entirely, neglected, it, and, do, not, say, a, word, about, it, and, if, others, have, spoken, of, it, know, that, they, have, taken, it, from, me, or, my, students, this, caused, an, upset, in, the, european, medical, community, and, having, read, colombo, s, and, falloppio, s, detailed, descriptions, of, the, clitoris, vesalius, stated, it, is, unreasonable, to, blame, others, for, incompetence, on, the, basis, of, some, sport, of, nature, you, have, observed, in, some, women, and, you, can, hardly, ascribe, this, new, and, useless, part, as, if, it, were, an, organ, to, healthy, women, he, concluded, i, think, that, such, a, structure, appears, in, hermaphrodites, who, otherwise, have, well, formed, genitals, as, paul, of, aegina, describes, but, i, have, never, once, seen, in, any, woman, a, penis, which, avicenna, called, albaratha, and, the, greeks, called, an, enlarged, nympha, and, classed, as, an, illness, or, even, the, rudiments, of, a, tiny, phallus, the, average, anatomist, had, difficulty, challenging, galen, s, or, vesalius, research, galen, was, the, most, famous, physician, of, the, greek, era, and, his, works, were, considered, the, standard, of, medical, understanding, up, to, and, throughout, the, renaissance, i, e, for, almost, two, thousand, years, and, various, terms, being, used, to, describe, the, clitoris, seemed, to, have, further, confused, the, issue, of, its, structure, in, addition, to, avicenna, s, naming, it, the, albaratha, or, virga, rod, and, colombo, s, calling, it, the, sweetness, of, venus, hippocrates, used, the, term, columella, little, pillar, and, albucasis, an, arabic, medical, authority, named, it, tentigo, tension, the, names, indicated, that, each, description, of, the, structures, was, about, the, body, and, glans, of, the, clitoris, but, usually, the, glans, it, was, additionally, known, to, the, romans, who, named, it, vulgar, slang, landica, however, albertus, magnus, one, of, the, most, prolific, writers, of, the, middle, ages, felt, that, it, was, important, to, highlight, homologies, between, male, and, female, structures, and, function, by, adding, a, psychology, of, sexual, arousal, that, aristotle, had, not, used, to, detail, the, clitoris, while, in, constantine, s, treatise, liber, de, coitu, the, clitoris, is, referred, to, a, few, times, magnus, gave, an, equal, amount, of, attention, to, male, and, female, organs, like, avicenna, magnus, also, used, the, word, virga, for, the, clitoris, but, employed, it, for, the, male, and, female, genitals, despite, his, efforts, to, give, equal, ground, to, the, clitoris, the, cycle, of, suppression, and, rediscovery, of, the, organ, continued, and, a, 16th, century, justification, for, clitoridectomy, appears, to, have, been, confused, with, intersex, conditions, and, the, imprecision, created, by, the, word, nymphae, substituted, for, the, word, clitoris, nymphotomy, was, a, medical, operation, to, excise, an, unusually, large, clitoris, but, what, was, considered, unusually, large, was, often, a, matter, of, perception, the, procedure, was, routinely, performed, on, egyptian, women, due, to, physicians, such, as, jacques, dal, champs, who, believed, that, this, version, of, the, clitoris, was, an, unusual, feature, that, occurred, in, almost, all, egyptian, women, some, of, ours, so, that, when, they, find, themselves, in, the, company, of, other, women, or, their, clothes, rub, them, while, they, walk, or, their, husbands, wish, to, approach, them, it, erects, like, a, male, penis, and, indeed, they, use, it, to, play, with, other, women, as, their, husbands, would, do, thus, the, parts, are, cut, caspar, bartholin, whom, bartholin, s, glands, are, named, after, a, 17th, century, danish, anatomist, dismissed, colombo, s, and, falloppio, s, claims, that, they, discovered, the, clitoris, arguing, that, the, clitoris, had, been, widely, known, to, medical, science, since, the, second, century, although, 17th, century, midwives, recommended, to, men, and, women, that, women, should, aspire, to, achieve, orgasms, to, help, them, get, pregnant, for, general, health, and, well, being, and, to, keep, their, relationships, healthy, debate, about, the, importance, of, the, clitoris, persisted, notably, in, the, work, of, regnier, de, graaf, in, the, 17th, century, and, georg, ludwig, kobelt, in, the, 19th, like, falloppio, and, bartholin, de, graaf, criticized, colombo, s, claim, of, having, discovered, the, clitoris, his, work, appears, to, have, provided, the, first, comprehensive, account, of, clitoral, anatomy, we, are, extremely, surprised, that, some, anatomists, make, no, more, mention, of, this, part, than, if, it, did, not, exist, at, all, in, the, universe, of, nature, he, stated, in, every, cadaver, we, have, so, far, dissected, we, have, found, it, quite, perceptible, to, sight, and, touch, de, graaf, stressed, the, need, to, distinguish, nympha, from, clitoris, choosing, to, always, give, the, name, clitoris, to, avoid, confusion, this, resulted, in, the, frequent, use, of, the, correct, name, for, the, organ, among, anatomists, but, considering, that, nympha, was, also, varied, in, its, use, and, eventually, became, the, term, specific, to, the, labia, minora, more, confusion, ensued, debate, about, whether, orgasm, was, even, necessary, for, women, began, in, the, victorian, era, and, freud, s, 1905, theory, about, the, immaturity, of, clitoral, orgasms, see, above, negatively, affected, women, s, sexuality, throughout, most, of, the, 20th, century, toward, the, end, of, world, war, i, a, maverick, british, mp, named, noel, pemberton, billing, published, an, article, entitled, the, cult, of, the, clitoris, furthering, his, conspiracy, theories, and, attacking, the, actress, maud, allan, and, margot, asquith, wife, of, the, prime, minister, the, accusations, led, to, a, sensational, libel, trial, which, billing, eventually, won, philip, hoare, reports, that, billing, argued, that, as, a, medical, term, clitoris, would, only, be, known, to, the, initiated, and, was, incapable, of, corrupting, moral, minds, jodie, medd, argues, regarding, the, cult, of, the, clitoris, that, the, female, non, reproductive, but, desiring, body, simultaneously, demands, and, refuses, interpretative, attention, inciting, scandal, through, its, very, resistance, to, representation, from, the, 18th, to, the, 20th, century, especially, during, the, 20th, details, of, the, clitoris, from, various, genital, diagrams, presented, in, earlier, centuries, were, omitted, from, later, texts, the, full, extent, of, the, clitoris, was, alluded, to, by, masters, and, johnson, in, 1966, but, in, such, a, muddled, fashion, that, the, significance, of, their, description, became, obscured, in, 1981, the, federation, of, feminist, women, s, health, clinics, ffwhc, continued, this, process, with, anatomically, precise, illustrations, identifying, 18, structures, of, the, clitoris, despite, the, ffwhc, s, illustrations, josephine, lowndes, sevely, in, 1987, described, the, vagina, as, more, of, the, counterpart, of, the, penis, concerning, other, beliefs, about, the, clitoris, hite, 1976, and, 1981, found, that, during, sexual, intimacy, with, a, partner, clitoral, stimulation, was, more, often, described, by, women, as, foreplay, than, as, a, primary, method, of, sexual, activity, including, orgasm, further, although, the, ffwhc, s, work, significantly, propelled, feminist, reformation, of, anatomical, texts, it, did, not, have, a, general, impact, helen, o, connell, s, late, 1990s, research, motivated, the, medical, community, to, start, changing, the, way, the, clitoris, is, anatomically, defined, o, connell, describes, typical, textbook, descriptions, of, the, clitoris, as, lacking, detail, and, including, inaccuracies, such, as, older, and, modern, anatomical, descriptions, of, the, female, human, urethral, and, genital, anatomy, having, been, based, on, dissections, performed, on, elderly, cadavers, whose, erectile, clitoral, tissue, had, shrunk, she, instead, credits, the, work, of, georg, ludwig, kobelt, as, the, most, comprehensive, and, accurate, description, of, clitoral, anatomy, mri, measurements, which, provide, a, live, and, multi, planar, method, of, examination, now, complement, the, ffwhc, s, as, well, as, o, connell, s, research, efforts, concerning, the, clitoris, showing, that, the, volume, of, clitoral, erectile, tissue, is, ten, times, that, which, is, shown, in, doctors, offices, and, anatomy, textbooks, in, bruce, bagemihl, s, survey, of, the, zoological, record, 1978, 1997, which, contains, over, a, million, documents, from, over, 6, 000, scientific, journals, 539, articles, focusing, on, the, penis, were, found, while, seven, were, found, focusing, on, the, clitoris, in, 2000, researchers, shirley, ogletree, and, harvey, ginsberg, concluded, that, there, is, a, general, neglect, of, the, word, clitoris, in, the, common, vernacular, they, looked, at, the, terms, used, to, describe, genitalia, in, the, psycinfo, database, from, 1887, to, 2000, and, found, that, penis, was, used, in, 1, 482, sources, vagina, in, 409, while, clitoris, was, only, mentioned, in, 83, they, additionally, analyzed, 57, books, listed, in, a, computer, database, for, sex, instruction, in, the, majority, of, the, books, penis, was, the, most, commonly, discussed, body, part, mentioned, more, than, clitoris, vagina, and, uterus, put, together, they, last, investigated, terminology, used, by, college, students, ranging, from, euro, american, 76, 76, hispanic, 18, 14, and, african, american, 4, 7, regarding, the, students, beliefs, about, sexuality, and, knowledge, on, the, subject, the, students, were, overwhelmingly, educated, to, believe, that, the, vagina, is, the, female, counterpart, of, the, penis, the, authors, found, that, the, student, s, belief, that, the, inner, portion, of, the, vagina, is, the, most, sexually, sensitive, part, of, the, female, body, correlated, with, negative, attitudes, toward, masturbation, and, strong, support, for, sexual, myths, a, study, in, 2005, reported, that, among, a, sample, of, undergraduate, students, the, most, frequently, cited, sources, for, knowledge, about, the, clitoris, were, school, and, friends, and, that, this, was, associated, with, the, least, tested, knowledge, knowledge, of, the, clitoris, by, self, exploration, was, the, least, cited, but, respondents, correctly, answered, on, average, three, of, the, five, clitoral, knowledge, measures, the, authors, stated, that, nowledge, correlated, significantly, with, the, frequency, of, women, s, orgasm, in, masturbation, but, not, partnered, sex, and, that, their, results, are, discussed, in, light, of, gender, inequality, and, a, social, construction, of, sexuality, endorsed, by, both, men, and, women, that, privileges, men, s, sexual, pleasure, over, women, s, such, that, orgasm, for, women, is, pleasing, but, ultimately, incidental, they, concluded, that, part, of, the, solution, to, remedying, this, problem, requires, that, males, and, females, are, taught, more, about, the, clitoris, than, is, currently, practiced, the, humanitarian, group, clitoraid, launched, the, first, annual, international, clitoris, awareness, week, from, 6, to, 12, may, in, 2015, clitoraid, spokesperson, nadine, gary, stated, that, the, group, s, mission, is, to, raise, public, awareness, about, the, clitoris, because, it, has, been, ignored, vilified, made, taboo, and, considered, sinful, and, shameful, for, centuries, see, also, vulva, activism, odile, fillod, created, a, 3d, printable, open, source, full, size, model, of, the, clitoris, for, use, in, a, set, of, anti, sexist, videos, she, had, been, commissioned, to, produce, fillod, was, interviewed, by, stephanie, theobald, whose, article, in, the, guardian, stated, that, the, 3d, model, would, be, used, for, sex, education, in, french, schools, from, primary, to, secondary, level, from, september, 2016, onwards, this, was, not, the, case, but, the, story, went, viral, across, the, world, a, questionnaire, in, a, 2019, study, was, administered, to, a, sample, of, educational, sciences, postgraduate, students, to, trace, the, level, of, their, knowledge, concerning, the, organs, of, the, female, and, male, reproductive, system, the, authors, reported, that, about, two, thirds, of, the, students, failed, to, name, parts, of, the, vulva, such, as, the, clitoris, and, labia, even, after, detailed, pictures, were, provided, to, them, an, analysis, in, 2022, reported, that, the, clitoris, is, mentioned, in, only, one, out, of, 113, greek, secondary, education, textbooks, used, in, biology, classes, from, the, 1870s, to, present, new, york, artist, sophia, wallace, started, work, in, 2012, on, a, multimedia, project, to, challenge, misconceptions, about, the, clitoris, based, on, o, connell, s, 1998, research, wallace, s, work, emphasizes, the, sheer, scope, and, size, of, the, human, clitoris, she, says, that, ignorance, of, this, still, seems, to, be, pervasive, in, modern, society, it, is, a, curious, dilemma, to, observe, the, paradox, that, on, the, one, hand, the, female, body, is, the, primary, metaphor, for, sexuality, its, use, saturates, advertising, art, and, the, mainstream, erotic, imaginary, she, said, yet, the, clitoris, the, true, female, sexual, organ, is, virtually, invisible, the, project, is, called, cliteracy, and, it, includes, a, clit, rodeo, which, is, interactive, climb, on, model, of, a, giant, golden, clitoris, including, its, inner, parts, produced, with, the, help, of, sculptor, kenneth, thomas, it, s, been, a, showstopper, wherever, it, s, been, shown, people, are, hungry, to, be, able, to, talk, about, this, wallace, said, i, love, seeing, men, standing, up, for, the, clit, cliteracy, is, about, not, having, one, s, body, controlled, or, legislated, not, having, access, to, the, pleasure, that, is, your, birthright, is, a, deeply, political, act, another, project, started, in, new, york, in, 2016, street, art, that, has, since, spread, to, almost, 100, cities, clitorosity, a, community, driven, effort, to, celebrate, the, full, structure, of, the, clitoris, combining, chalk, drawings, and, words, to, spark, interaction, and, conversation, with, passers, by, which, the, team, documents, on, social, media, in, 2016, lori, mal, part, traversy, made, an, animated, documentary, about, the, unrecognized, anatomy, of, the, clitoris, alli, sebastian, wolf, created, a, golden, 100, 1, scale, model, of, the, clitoris, in, 2017, called, the, glitoris, and, said, she, hopes, knowledge, of, the, clitoris, will, soon, become, so, uncontroversial, that, making, art, about, them, would, be, as, irrelevant, as, making, art, about, penises, other, projects, listed, by, the, bbc, include, clito, clito, body, positive, jewellery, made, in, berlin, clitorissima, a, documentary, intended, to, normalize, mother, daughter, conversations, about, the, clitoris, and, a, clitart, festival, in, london, encompassing, spoken, word, performances, as, well, as, visual, art, french, art, collective, les, infemmes, a, blend, word, of, infamous, and, women, published, a, fanzine, whose, title, can, be, translated, as, the, clit, cheatsheet, significant, controversy, surrounds, female, genital, mutilation, fgm, with, the, world, health, organization, who, being, one, of, many, health, organizations, that, have, campaigned, against, the, procedures, on, behalf, of, human, rights, stating, that, fgm, has, no, health, benefits, and, that, it, is, a, violation, of, the, human, rights, of, girls, and, women, which, reflects, deep, rooted, inequality, between, the, sexes, the, practice, has, existed, at, one, point, or, another, in, almost, all, human, civilizations, most, commonly, to, exert, control, over, the, sexual, behavior, including, masturbation, of, girls, and, women, but, also, to, change, the, clitoris, appearance, custom, and, tradition, are, the, most, frequently, cited, reasons, for, fgm, with, some, cultures, believing, that, not, performing, it, has, the, possibility, of, disrupting, the, cohesiveness, of, their, social, and, political, systems, such, as, fgm, also, being, a, part, of, a, girl, s, initiation, into, adulthood, often, a, girl, is, not, considered, an, adult, in, an, fgm, practicing, society, unless, she, has, undergone, fgm, and, the, removal, of, the, clitoris, and, labia, viewed, by, some, as, the, male, parts, of, a, woman, s, body, is, thought, to, enhance, the, girl, s, femininity, often, synonymous, with, docility, and, obedience, female, genital, mutilation, is, carried, out, in, several, societies, especially, in, africa, with, 85, percent, of, genital, mutilations, performed, in, africa, consisting, of, clitoridectomy, or, excision, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, other, parts, of, the, middle, east, and, southeast, asia, on, girls, from, a, few, days, old, to, mid, adolescent, often, to, reduce, the, sexual, desire, to, preserve, vaginal, virginity, the, practice, of, fgm, has, spread, globally, as, immigrants, from, asia, africa, and, the, middle, east, bring, the, custom, with, them, in, the, united, states, it, is, sometimes, practiced, on, girls, born, with, a, clitoris, that, is, larger, than, usual, comfort, momoh, who, specializes, in, the, topic, of, fgm, states, that, fgm, might, have, been, practiced, in, ancient, egypt, as, a, sign, of, distinction, among, the, aristocracy, there, are, reports, that, traces, of, infibulation, are, on, egyptian, mummies, fgm, is, still, routinely, practiced, in, egypt, greenberg, et, al, report, that, one, study, found, that, 97, percent, of, married, women, in, egypt, had, had, some, form, of, genital, mutilation, performed, amnesty, international, estimated, in, 1997, that, more, than, two, million, fgm, procedures, are, performed, every, year, although, the, clitoris, and, clitoral, prepuce, sheath, exists, in, all, mammal, species, there, are, few, detailed, studies, of, the, anatomy, of, the, clitoris, in, non, humans, studies, have, been, done, on, the, clitoris, of, cats, sheep, and, mice, some, mammals, have, clitoral, glands, the, clitoris, is, especially, developed, in, fossas, non, human, apes, lemurs, moles, and, often, contains, a, small, bone, known, as, the, os, clitoridis, many, species, of, talpid, moles, exhibit, peniform, clitorises, that, are, tunneled, by, the, urethra, and, are, found, to, have, erectile, tissue, the, clitoris, is, contained, in, fossa, which, is, a, small, pouch, of, tissue, in, horses, and, dogs, the, clitoris, is, found, in, other, amniotic, creatures, including, reptiles, such, as, turtles, and, crocodilians, and, birds, such, as, ratites, e, g, cassowaries, ostriches, and, anatids, e, g, swans, ducks, the, hemiclitoris, is, one, half, of, a, paired, structure, in, squamates, lizards, and, snakes, some, intersex, female, bears, mate, and, give, birth, through, the, tip, of, the, clitoris, these, species, are, grizzly, bears, brown, bears, american, black, bears, and, polar, bears, although, the, bears, have, been, described, as, having, a, birth, canal, that, runs, through, the, clitoris, rather, than, forming, a, separate, vagina, a, feature, that, is, estimated, to, make, up, 10, to, 20, percent, of, the, bears, population, scientists, state, that, female, spotted, hyenas, are, the, only, non, intersex, female, mammals, devoid, of, an, external, vaginal, opening, and, whose, sexual, anatomy, is, distinct, from, usual, intersex, cases, in, spider, monkeys, the, clitoris, is, especially, developed, and, has, an, interior, passage, or, urethra, that, makes, it, almost, identical, to, the, penis, and, it, retains, and, distributes, urine, droplets, as, the, female, spider, monkey, moves, around, scholar, alan, f, dixson, stated, that, this, urine, is, voided, at, the, bases, of, the, clitoris, flows, down, the, shallow, groove, on, its, perineal, surface, and, is, held, by, the, skin, folds, on, each, side, of, the, groove, because, spider, monkeys, of, south, america, have, pendulous, and, erectile, clitorises, long, enough, to, be, mistaken, for, a, penis, researchers, and, observers, of, the, species, look, for, a, scrotum, to, determine, the, animal, s, sex, a, similar, approach, is, to, identify, scent, marking, glands, that, may, also, be, present, on, the, clitoris, the, clitoris, erects, in, squirrel, monkeys, during, dominance, displays, which, indirectly, influences, the, squirrel, monkeys, reproductive, success, the, clitoris, of, bonobos, is, larger, and, more, externalized, than, in, most, mammals, natalie, angier, said, that, a, young, adolescent, female, bonobo, is, maybe, half, the, weight, of, a, human, teenager, but, her, clitoris, is, three, times, bigger, than, the, human, equivalent, and, visible, enough, to, waggle, unmistakably, as, she, walks, female, bonobos, often, engage, in, the, practice, of, genital, genital, gg, rubbing, ethologist, jonathan, balcombe, stated, that, female, bonobos, rub, their, clitorises, together, rapidly, for, ten, to, twenty, seconds, and, this, behavior, which, may, be, repeated, in, rapid, succession, is, usually, accompanied, by, grinding, shrieking, and, clitoral, engorgement, he, added, that, on, average, they, engage, in, this, practice, about, once, every, two, hours, and, as, bonobos, sometimes, mate, face, to, face, evolutionary, biologist, marlene, zuk, has, suggested, that, the, position, of, the, clitoris, in, bonobos, and, some, other, primates, has, evolved, to, maximize, stimulation, during, sexual, intercourse, many, strepsirrhine, species, exhibit, elongated, clitorises, that, are, either, fully, or, partially, tunneled, by, the, urethra, including, mouse, lemurs, dwarf, lemurs, all, eulemur, species, lorises, and, galagos, some, of, these, species, also, exhibit, a, membrane, seal, across, the, vagina, that, closes, the, vaginal, opening, during, the, non, mating, seasons, most, notably, mouse, and, dwarf, lemurs, the, clitoral, morphology, of, the, ring, tailed, lemur, is, the, most, well, studied, they, are, described, as, having, elongated, pendulous, clitorises, that, are, tunneled, by, a, urethra, the, urethra, is, surrounded, by, erectile, tissue, which, allows, for, significant, swelling, during, breeding, seasons, but, this, erectile, tissue, differs, from, the, typical, male, corpus, spongiosum, non, pregnant, adult, ring, tailed, females, do, not, show, higher, testosterone, levels, than, males, but, they, do, exhibit, higher, a, 4, and, estrogen, levels, during, seasonal, aggression, during, pregnancy, estrogen, a, 4, and, testosterone, levels, are, raised, but, female, fetuses, are, still, protected, from, excess, testosterone, these, masculinized, genitalia, are, often, found, alongside, other, traits, such, as, female, dominated, social, groups, reduced, sexual, dimorphism, that, makes, females, the, same, size, as, males, and, even, ratios, of, sexes, in, adult, populations, this, phenomenon, that, has, been, dubbed, the, lemur, syndrome, a, 2014, study, of, eulemur, masculinization, proposed, that, behavioral, and, morphological, masculinization, in, female, lemuriformes, is, an, ancestral, trait, that, likely, emerged, after, their, split, from, lorisiformes, while, female, spotted, hyenas, were, sometimes, referred, to, as, pseudohermaphrodites, and, scientists, of, ancient, and, later, historical, times, believed, that, they, were, hermaphrodites, modern, scientists, do, not, refer, to, them, as, such, that, designation, is, typically, reserved, for, those, who, simultaneously, exhibit, features, of, both, sexes, the, genetic, makeup, of, female, spotted, hyenas, are, clearly, distinct, from, male, spotted, hyenas, female, spotted, hyenas, have, a, clitoris, 90, percent, as, long, and, the, same, diameter, as, a, male, penis, 171, millimetres, long, and, 22, millimetres, in, diameter, and, this, pseudo, penis, formation, seems, largely, androgen, independent, because, it, appears, in, the, female, fetus, before, differentiation, of, the, fetal, ovary, and, adrenal, gland, the, spotted, hyenas, have, a, highly, erectile, clitoris, complete, with, a, false, scrotum, author, john, c, wingfield, stated, that, the, resemblance, to, male, genitalia, is, so, close, that, sex, can, be, determined, with, confidence, only, by, palpation, of, the, scrotum, the, pseudo, penis, can, also, be, distinguished, from, the, males, genitalia, by, its, greater, thickness, and, more, rounded, glans, the, female, possesses, no, external, vagina, as, the, labia, are, fused, to, form, a, pseudo, scrotum, in, the, females, this, scrotum, consists, of, soft, adipose, tissue, like, male, spotted, hyenas, with, regard, to, their, penises, the, female, spotted, hyenas, have, small, spines, on, the, head, of, their, clitorises, which, scholar, catherine, blackledge, said, makes, the, clitoris, tip, feel, like, soft, sandpaper, she, added, that, the, clitoris, extends, away, from, the, body, in, a, sleek, and, slender, arc, measuring, on, average, over, 17, cm, from, root, to, tip, just, like, a, penis, is, fully, erectile, raising, its, head, in, hyena, greeting, ceremonies, social, displays, games, of, rough, and, tumble, or, when, sniffing, out, peers, due, to, their, higher, levels, of, androgen, exposure, during, fetal, development, the, female, hyenas, are, significantly, more, muscular, and, aggressive, than, their, male, counterparts, social, wise, they, are, of, higher, rank, than, the, males, being, dominant, or, dominant, and, alpha, and, the, females, who, have, been, exposed, to, higher, levels, of, androgen, than, average, become, higher, ranking, than, their, female, peers, subordinate, females, lick, the, clitorises, of, higher, ranked, females, as, a, sign, of, submission, and, obedience, but, females, also, lick, each, other, s, clitorises, as, a, greeting, or, to, strengthen, social, bonds, in, contrast, while, all, males, lick, the, clitorises, of, dominant, females, the, females, will, not, lick, the, penises, of, males, because, males, are, considered, to, be, of, lowest, rank, the, female, spotted, hyenas, urinate, copulate, and, give, birth, through, the, clitoris, since, the, urethra, and, vagina, exit, through, the, clitoral, glans, this, trait, makes, mating, more, laborious, for, the, male, than, in, other, mammals, and, also, makes, attempts, to, sexually, coerce, physically, force, sexual, activity, on, females, futile, joan, roughgarden, an, ecologist, and, evolutionary, biologist, said, that, because, the, hyena, s, clitoris, is, higher, on, the, belly, than, the, vagina, in, most, mammals, the, male, hyena, must, slide, his, rear, under, the, female, when, mating, so, that, his, penis, lines, up, with, in, an, action, similar, to, pushing, up, a, shirtsleeve, the, female, retracts, the, on, itself, and, creates, an, opening, into, which, the, male, inserts, his, own, penis, the, male, must, practice, this, act, which, can, take, a, couple, of, months, to, successfully, perform, female, spotted, hyenas, exposed, to, larger, doses, of, androgen, have, significantly, damaged, ovaries, making, it, difficult, to, conceive, after, giving, birth, the, pseudo, penis, is, stretched, and, loses, much, of, its, original, aspects, it, becomes, a, slack, walled, and, reduced, prepuce, with, an, enlarged, orifice, with, split, lips, approximately, 15, of, the, females, die, during, their, first, time, giving, birth, and, over, 60, of, their, species, firstborn, young, die, a, 2006, baskin, et, al, study, concluded, the, basic, anatomical, structures, of, the, corporeal, bodies, in, both, sexes, of, humans, and, spotted, hyenas, were, similar, as, in, humans, the, dorsal, nerve, distribution, was, unique, in, being, devoid, of, nerves, at, the, 12, o, clock, position, in, the, penis, and, clitoris, of, the, spotted, hyena, and, that, orsal, nerves, of, the, penis, clitoris, in, humans, and, male, spotted, hyenas, tracked, along, both, sides, of, the, corporeal, body, to, the, corpus, spongiosum, at, the, 5, and, 7, o, clock, positions, the, dorsal, nerves, penetrated, the, corporeal, body, and, distally, the, glans, in, the, hyena, and, in, female, hyenas, the, dorsal, nerves, fanned, out, laterally, on, the, clitoral, body, glans, morphology, was, different, in, appearance, in, both, sexes, being, wide, and, blunt, in, the, female, and, tapered, in, the, male
