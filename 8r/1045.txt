spreading, jackfruit, trees, that, compete, for, space, with, native, tree, species, the, supply, of, jackfruit, has, allowed, the, marmoset, and, coati, populations, to, expand, since, both, prey, opportunistically, on, bird, eggs, and, nestlings, the, increases, in, marmoset, and, coati, populations, are, detrimental, to, local, birds
