moths, are, a, group, of, insects, that, includes, all, members, of, the, order, lepidoptera, that, are, not, butterflies, they, were, previously, classified, as, suborder, heterocera, but, the, group, is, paraphyletic, with, respect, to, butterflies, suborder, rhopalocera, and, neither, subordinate, taxon, is, used, in, modern, classifications, moths, make, up, the, vast, majority, of, the, order, there, are, approximately, 160, 000, species, of, moth, many, of, which, have, yet, to, be, described, most, species, of, moth, are, nocturnal, although, there, are, also, crepuscular, and, diurnal, species, while, the, butterflies, form, a, monophyletic, group, the, moths, comprising, the, rest, of, the, lepidoptera, do, not, many, attempts, have, been, made, to, group, the, superfamilies, of, the, lepidoptera, into, natural, groups, most, of, which, fail, because, one, of, the, two, groups, is, not, monophyletic, microlepidoptera, and, macrolepidoptera, heterocera, and, rhopalocera, jugatae, and, frenatae, monotrysia, and, ditrysia, although, the, rules, for, distinguishing, moths, from, butterflies, are, not, well, established, one, very, good, guiding, principle, is, that, butterflies, have, thin, antennae, and, with, the, exception, of, the, family, hedylidae, have, small, balls, or, clubs, at, the, end, of, their, antennae, moth, antennae, are, usually, feathery, with, no, ball, on, the, end, the, divisions, are, named, by, this, principle, club, antennae, rhopalocera, or, varied, antennae, heterocera, lepidoptera, first, evolved, during, the, carboniferous, period, but, only, evolved, their, characteristic, proboscis, alongside, the, rise, of, angiosperms, in, the, cretaceous, period, the, modern, english, word, moth, comes, from, old, english, mo, e, cf, northumbrian, moh, e, from, common, germanic, compare, old, norse, motti, dutch, mot, and, german, motte, all, meaning, moth, its, origins, are, possibly, related, to, the, old, english, ma, a, meaning, maggot, or, from, the, root, of, midge, which, until, the, 16th, century, was, used, mostly, to, indicate, the, larva, usually, in, reference, to, devouring, clothes, moth, larvae, or, caterpillars, make, cocoons, from, which, they, emerge, as, fully, grown, moths, with, wings, some, moth, caterpillars, dig, holes, in, the, ground, where, they, live, until, they, are, ready, to, turn, into, adult, moths, moths, evolved, long, before, butterflies, moth, fossils, have, been, found, that, may, be, 190, million, years, old, both, types, of, lepidoptera, are, thought, to, have, co, evolved, with, flowering, plants, mainly, because, most, modern, species, both, as, adults, and, larvae, feed, on, flowering, plants, one, of, the, earliest, known, species, that, is, thought, to, be, an, ancestor, of, moths, is, archaeolepis, mane, its, fossil, fragments, show, scaled, wings, that, are, similar, to, caddisflies, in, their, veining, some, moths, particularly, their, caterpillars, can, be, major, agricultural, pests, in, many, parts, of, the, world, examples, include, corn, borers, and, bollworms, the, caterpillar, of, the, spongy, moth, lymantria, dispar, causes, severe, damage, to, forests, in, the, northeastern, united, states, where, it, is, an, invasive, species, in, temperate, climates, the, codling, moth, causes, extensive, damage, especially, to, fruit, farms, in, tropical, and, subtropical, climates, the, diamondback, moth, plutella, xylostella, is, perhaps, the, most, serious, pest, of, brassicaceous, crops, also, in, sub, saharan, africa, the, african, sugarcane, borer, is, a, major, pest, of, sugarcane, maize, and, sorghum, several, moths, in, the, family, tineidae, are, commonly, regarded, as, pests, because, their, larvae, eat, fabric, such, as, clothes, and, blankets, made, from, natural, proteinaceous, fibers, such, as, wool, or, silk, they, are, less, likely, to, eat, mixed, materials, containing, some, artificial, fibers, there, are, some, reports, that, they, may, be, repelled, by, the, scent, of, wood, from, juniper, and, cedar, by, lavender, or, by, other, natural, oils, however, many, consider, this, unlikely, to, prevent, infestation, naphthalene, the, chemical, used, in, mothballs, is, considered, more, effective, but, there, are, concerns, over, its, effects, on, human, health, despite, being, commonly, thought, to, be, undertaken, by, all, moths, only, the, larvae, of, several, moth, species, eat, animal, fibres, creating, holes, in, articles, of, clothing, in, particular, those, made, of, wool, most, species, do, not, eat, fabrics, and, some, moth, adults, do, not, even, eat, at, all, some, like, the, luna, polyphemus, atlas, promethea, cecropia, and, other, large, moths, do, not, have, mouth, parts, this, is, possible, because, they, live, off, the, food, stores, from, when, they, were, a, caterpillar, and, only, live, a, short, time, as, an, adult, roughly, a, week, for, some, species, many, species, of, adult, moths, do, however, eat, for, instance, many, will, drink, nectar, items, of, fabric, infested, by, clothes, moth, larvae, may, be, treated, by, freezing, them, for, several, days, at, a, temperature, below, 8, c, 18, f, some, moths, are, farmed, for, their, economic, value, the, most, notable, of, these, is, the, silkworm, the, larva, of, the, domesticated, moth, bombyx, mori, it, is, farmed, for, the, silk, with, which, it, builds, its, cocoon, as, of, 2002, the, silk, industry, produces, more, than, 130, million, kilograms, of, raw, silk, worth, about, 250, million, u, s, dollars, each, year, not, all, silk, is, produced, by, bombyx, mori, there, are, several, species, of, saturniidae, that, also, are, farmed, for, their, silk, such, as, the, ailanthus, moth, samia, cynthia, group, of, species, the, chinese, oak, silkmoth, antheraea, pernyi, the, assam, silkmoth, antheraea, assamensis, and, the, japanese, silk, moth, antheraea, yamamai, the, larvae, of, many, species, are, used, as, food, particularly, in, africa, where, they, are, an, important, source, of, nutrition, the, mopane, worm, the, caterpillar, of, gonimbrasia, belina, from, the, family, saturniidae, is, a, significant, food, resource, in, southern, africa, another, saturniid, used, as, food, is, the, cavorting, emperor, usta, terpsichore, in, one, country, alone, congo, more, than, 30, species, of, moth, larvae, are, harvested, some, are, sold, not, only, in, the, local, village, markets, but, are, shipped, by, the, ton, from, one, country, to, another, nocturnal, insectivores, often, feed, on, moths, these, include, some, bats, some, species, of, owls, and, other, species, of, birds, moths, also, are, eaten, by, some, species, of, lizards, amphibians, cats, dogs, rodents, and, some, bears, moth, larvae, are, vulnerable, to, being, parasitized, by, ichneumonidae, baculoviruses, are, parasite, double, stranded, dna, insect, viruses, that, are, used, mostly, as, biological, control, agents, they, are, members, of, the, baculoviridae, a, family, that, is, restricted, to, insects, most, baculovirus, isolates, have, been, obtained, from, insects, in, particular, from, lepidoptera, there, is, evidence, that, ultrasound, in, the, range, emitted, by, bats, causes, flying, moths, to, make, evasive, maneuvers, ultrasonic, frequencies, trigger, a, reflex, action, in, the, noctuid, moth, that, causes, it, to, drop, a, few, centimeters, or, inches, in, its, flight, to, evade, attack, and, tiger, moths, can, emit, clicks, to, foil, bats, echolocation, the, fungus, ophiocordyceps, sinensis, infects, the, larvae, of, many, different, species, of, moths, moths, like, butterflies, bees, and, other, more, popularly, recognized, pollinating, insects, serve, an, essential, role, as, pollinators, for, many, flowering, plants, including, species, that, bees, do, not, visit, nocturnal, moths, fly, from, flower, to, flower, to, feed, on, nectar, during, the, night, much, as, their, diurnal, relatives, do, during, the, day, a, study, conducted, in, the, uk, found, moths, dusted, with, pollen, from, 47, different, plant, species, including, seven, species, largely, ignored, by, bees, some, studies, indicate, that, certain, species, of, moths, such, as, those, belonging, to, the, families, erebidae, and, sphingidae, may, be, the, key, pollinators, for, some, flowering, plants, in, the, himalayan, ecosystem, the, roles, of, moths, as, pollinators, have, been, studied, less, frequently, than, those, of, diurnal, pollinators, but, recent, studies, have, established, that, moths, are, important, but, often, overlooked, nocturnal, pollinators, of, a, wide, range, of, plants, some, researchers, say, it, is, likely, that, many, plants, thought, to, be, dependent, on, bees, for, pollination, also, rely, on, moths, which, have, historically, been, less, observed, because, they, pollinate, mainly, at, night, moths, frequently, appear, to, circle, artificial, lights, the, reason, for, this, behavior, positive, phototaxis, is, currently, unknown, one, hypothesis, is, called, celestial, or, transverse, orientation, by, maintaining, a, constant, angular, relationship, to, a, bright, celestial, light, such, as, the, moon, they, can, fly, in, a, straight, line, celestial, objects, are, so, far, away, that, even, after, travelling, great, distances, the, change, in, angle, between, the, moth, and, the, light, source, is, negligible, further, the, moon, will, always, be, in, the, upper, part, of, the, visual, field, or, on, the, horizon, when, a, moth, encounters, a, much, closer, artificial, light, and, uses, it, for, navigation, the, angle, changes, noticeably, after, only, a, short, distance, in, addition, to, being, often, below, the, horizon, the, moth, instinctively, attempts, to, correct, by, turning, toward, the, light, thereby, causing, airborne, moths, to, come, plummeting, downward, and, resulting, in, a, spiral, flight, path, that, gets, closer, and, closer, to, the, light, source, studies, have, found, that, light, pollution, caused, by, increasing, use, of, artificial, lights, has, either, led, to, a, severe, decline, in, moth, population, in, some, parts, of, the, world, or, has, severely, disrupted, nocturnal, pollination, quotations, related, to,
