see, text, duck, is, the, common, name, for, numerous, species, of, waterfowl, in, the, family, anatidae, ducks, are, generally, smaller, and, shorter, necked, than, swans, and, geese, which, are, members, of, the, same, family, divided, among, several, subfamilies, they, are, a, form, taxon, they, do, not, represent, a, monophyletic, group, the, group, of, all, descendants, of, a, single, common, ancestral, species, since, swans, and, geese, are, not, considered, ducks, ducks, are, mostly, aquatic, birds, and, may, be, found, in, both, fresh, water, and, sea, water, ducks, are, sometimes, confused, with, several, types, of, unrelated, water, birds, with, similar, forms, such, as, loons, or, divers, grebes, gallinules, and, coots, the, word, duck, comes, from, old, english, d, ce, diver, a, derivative, of, the, verb, d, can, to, duck, bend, down, low, as, if, to, get, under, something, or, dive, because, of, the, way, many, species, in, the, dabbling, duck, group, feed, by, upending, compare, with, dutch, duiken, and, german, tauchen, to, dive, this, word, replaced, old, english, ened, nid, duck, possibly, to, avoid, confusion, with, other, words, such, as, ende, end, with, similar, forms, other, germanic, languages, still, have, similar, words, for, duck, for, example, dutch, eend, german, ente, and, norwegian, and, the, word, ened, nid, was, inherited, from, proto, indo, european, cf, latin, anas, duck, lithuanian, ntis, duck, ancient, greek, n, ssa, n, tta, duck, and, sanskrit, t, water, bird, among, others, a, duckling, is, a, young, duck, in, downy, plumage, or, baby, duck, but, in, the, food, trade, a, young, domestic, duck, which, has, just, reached, adult, size, and, bulk, and, its, meat, is, still, fully, tender, is, sometimes, labelled, as, a, duckling, a, male, is, called, a, drake, and, the, female, is, called, a, duck, or, in, ornithology, a, hen, all, ducks, belong, to, the, biological, order, anseriformes, a, group, that, contains, the, ducks, geese, and, swans, as, well, as, the, screamers, and, the, magpie, goose, all, except, the, screamers, belong, to, the, biological, family, anatidae, within, the, family, ducks, are, split, into, a, variety, of, subfamilies, and, tribes, the, number, and, composition, of, these, subfamilies, and, tribes, is, the, cause, of, considerable, disagreement, among, taxonomists, some, base, their, decisions, on, morphological, characteristics, others, on, shared, behaviours, or, genetic, studies, the, number, of, suggested, subfamilies, containing, ducks, ranges, from, two, to, five, the, significant, level, of, hybridisation, that, occurs, among, wild, ducks, complicates, efforts, to, tease, apart, the, relationships, between, various, species, in, most, modern, classifications, the, so, called, true, ducks, belong, to, the, subfamily, anatinae, which, is, further, split, into, a, varying, number, of, tribes, the, largest, of, these, the, anatini, contains, the, dabbling, or, river, ducks, named, for, their, method, of, feeding, primarily, at, the, surface, of, fresh, water, the, diving, ducks, also, named, for, their, primary, feeding, method, make, up, the, tribe, aythyini, the, sea, ducks, of, the, tribe, mergini, are, diving, ducks, which, specialise, on, fish, and, shellfish, and, spend, a, majority, of, their, lives, in, saltwater, the, tribe, oxyurini, contains, the, stifftails, diving, ducks, notable, for, their, small, size, and, stiff, upright, tails, a, number, of, other, species, called, ducks, are, not, considered, to, be, true, ducks, and, are, typically, placed, in, other, subfamilies, or, tribes, the, whistling, ducks, are, assigned, either, to, a, tribe, dendrocygnini, in, the, subfamily, anatinae, or, the, subfamily, anserinae, or, to, their, own, subfamily, dendrocygninae, or, family, dendrocyganidae, the, freckled, duck, of, australia, is, either, the, sole, member, of, the, tribe, stictonettini, in, the, subfamily, anserinae, or, in, its, own, family, the, stictonettinae, the, shelducks, make, up, the, tribe, tadornini, in, the, family, anserinae, in, some, classifications, and, their, own, subfamily, tadorninae, in, others, while, the, steamer, ducks, are, either, placed, in, the, family, anserinae, in, the, tribe, tachyerini, or, lumped, with, the, shelducks, in, the, tribe, tadorini, the, perching, ducks, make, up, in, the, tribe, cairinini, in, the, subfamily, anserinae, in, some, classifications, while, that, tribe, is, eliminated, in, other, classifications, and, its, members, assigned, to, the, tribe, anatini, the, torrent, duck, is, generally, included, in, the, subfamily, anserinae, in, the, monotypic, tribe, merganettini, but, is, sometimes, included, in, the, tribe, tadornini, the, pink, eared, duck, is, sometimes, included, as, a, true, duck, either, in, the, tribe, anatini, or, the, tribe, malacorhynchini, and, other, times, is, included, with, the, shelducks, in, the, tribe, tadornini, the, overall, body, plan, of, ducks, is, elongated, and, broad, and, they, are, also, relatively, long, necked, albeit, not, as, long, necked, as, the, geese, and, swans, the, body, shape, of, diving, ducks, varies, somewhat, from, this, in, being, more, rounded, the, bill, is, usually, broad, and, contains, serrated, pectens, which, are, particularly, well, defined, in, the, filter, feeding, species, in, the, case, of, some, fishing, species, the, bill, is, long, and, strongly, serrated, the, scaled, legs, are, strong, and, well, developed, and, generally, set, far, back, on, the, body, more, so, in, the, highly, aquatic, species, the, wings, are, very, strong, and, are, generally, short, and, pointed, and, the, flight, of, ducks, requires, fast, continuous, strokes, requiring, in, turn, strong, wing, muscles, three, species, of, steamer, duck, are, almost, flightless, however, many, species, of, duck, are, temporarily, flightless, while, moulting, they, seek, out, protected, habitat, with, good, food, supplies, during, this, period, this, moult, typically, precedes, migration, the, drakes, of, northern, species, often, have, extravagant, plumage, but, that, is, moulted, in, summer, to, give, a, more, female, like, appearance, the, eclipse, plumage, southern, resident, species, typically, show, less, sexual, dimorphism, although, there, are, exceptions, such, as, the, paradise, shelduck, of, new, zealand, which, is, both, strikingly, sexually, dimorphic, and, in, which, the, female, s, plumage, is, brighter, than, that, of, the, male, the, plumage, of, juvenile, birds, generally, resembles, that, of, the, female, female, ducks, have, evolved, to, have, a, corkscrew, shaped, vagina, to, prevent, rape, ducks, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, and, are, found, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, several, species, manage, to, live, on, subantarctic, islands, including, south, georgia, and, the, auckland, islands, ducks, have, reached, a, number, of, isolated, oceanic, islands, including, the, hawaiian, islands, micronesia, and, the, gal, pagos, islands, where, they, are, often, vagrants, and, less, often, residents, a, handful, are, endemic, to, such, far, flung, islands, some, duck, species, mainly, those, breeding, in, the, temperate, and, arctic, northern, hemisphere, are, migratory, those, in, the, tropics, are, generally, not, some, ducks, particularly, in, australia, where, rainfall, is, erratic, are, nomadic, seeking, out, the, temporary, lakes, and, pools, that, form, after, localised, heavy, rain, ducks, eat, food, sources, such, as, grasses, aquatic, plants, fish, insects, small, amphibians, worms, and, small, molluscs, dabbling, ducks, feed, on, the, surface, of, water, or, on, land, or, as, deep, as, they, can, reach, by, up, ending, without, completely, submerging, along, the, edge, of, the, bill, there, is, a, comb, like, structure, called, a, pecten, this, strains, the, water, squirting, from, the, side, of, the, bill, and, traps, any, food, the, pecten, is, also, used, to, preen, feathers, and, to, hold, slippery, food, items, diving, ducks, and, sea, ducks, forage, deep, underwater, to, be, able, to, submerge, more, easily, the, diving, ducks, are, heavier, than, dabbling, ducks, and, therefore, have, more, difficulty, taking, off, to, fly, a, few, specialized, species, such, as, the, mergansers, are, adapted, to, catch, and, swallow, large, fish, the, others, have, the, characteristic, wide, flat, bill, adapted, to, dredging, type, jobs, such, as, pulling, up, waterweed, pulling, worms, and, small, molluscs, out, of, mud, searching, for, insect, larvae, and, bulk, jobs, such, as, dredging, out, holding, turning, head, first, and, swallowing, a, squirming, frog, to, avoid, injury, when, digging, into, sediment, it, has, no, cere, but, the, nostrils, come, out, through, hard, horn, the, guardian, published, an, article, advising, that, ducks, should, not, be, fed, with, bread, because, it, damages, the, health, of, the, ducks, and, pollutes, waterways, ducks, generally, only, have, one, partner, at, a, time, although, the, partnership, usually, only, lasts, one, year, larger, species, and, the, more, sedentary, species, like, fast, river, specialists, tend, to, have, pair, bonds, that, last, numerous, years, most, duck, species, breed, once, a, year, choosing, to, do, so, in, favourable, conditions, spring, summer, or, wet, seasons, ducks, also, tend, to, make, a, nest, before, breeding, and, after, hatching, lead, their, ducklings, to, water, mother, ducks, are, very, caring, and, protective, of, their, young, but, may, abandon, some, of, their, ducklings, if, they, are, physically, stuck, in, an, area, they, cannot, get, out, of, such, as, nesting, in, an, enclosed, courtyard, or, are, not, prospering, due, to, genetic, defects, or, sickness, brought, about, by, hypothermia, starvation, or, disease, ducklings, can, also, be, orphaned, by, inconsistent, late, hatching, where, a, few, eggs, hatch, after, the, mother, has, abandoned, the, nest, and, led, her, ducklings, to, water, female, mallard, ducks, as, well, as, several, other, species, in, the, genus, anas, such, as, the, american, and, pacific, black, ducks, spot, billed, duck, northern, pintail, and, common, teal, make, the, classic, quack, sound, while, males, make, a, similar, but, raspier, sound, that, is, sometimes, written, as, breeeeze, but, despite, widespread, misconceptions, most, species, of, duck, do, not, quack, in, general, ducks, make, a, range, of, calls, including, whistles, cooing, yodels, and, grunts, for, example, the, scaup, which, are, diving, ducks, make, a, noise, like, scaup, hence, their, name, calls, may, be, loud, displaying, calls, or, quieter, contact, calls, a, common, urban, legend, claims, that, duck, quacks, do, not, echo, however, this, has, been, proven, to, be, false, this, myth, was, first, debunked, by, the, acoustics, research, centre, at, the, university, of, salford, in, 2003, as, part, of, the, british, association, s, festival, of, science, it, was, also, debunked, in, one, of, the, earlier, episodes, of, the, popular, discovery, channel, television, show, mythbusters, ducks, have, many, predators, ducklings, are, particularly, vulnerable, since, their, inability, to, fly, makes, them, easy, prey, not, only, for, predatory, birds, but, also, for, large, fish, like, pike, crocodilians, predatory, testudines, such, as, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, and, other, aquatic, hunters, including, fish, eating, birds, such, as, herons, ducks, nests, are, raided, by, land, based, predators, and, brooding, females, may, be, caught, unaware, on, the, nest, by, mammals, such, as, foxes, or, large, birds, such, as, hawks, or, owls, adult, ducks, are, fast, fliers, but, may, be, caught, on, the, water, by, large, aquatic, predators, including, big, fish, such, as, the, north, american, muskie, and, the, european, pike, in, flight, ducks, are, safe, from, all, but, a, few, predators, such, as, humans, and, the, peregrine, falcon, which, uses, its, speed, and, strength, to, catch, ducks, humans, have, hunted, ducks, since, prehistoric, times, excavations, of, middens, in, california, dating, to, 7800, 6400, bp, have, turned, up, bones, of, ducks, including, at, least, one, now, extinct, flightless, species, ducks, were, captured, in, significant, numbers, by, holocene, inhabitants, of, the, lower, ohio, river, valley, suggesting, they, took, advantage, of, the, seasonal, bounty, provided, by, migrating, waterfowl, neolithic, hunters, in, locations, as, far, apart, as, the, caribbean, scandinavia, egypt, switzerland, and, china, relied, on, ducks, as, a, source, of, protein, for, some, or, all, of, the, year, archeological, evidence, shows, that, m, ori, people, in, new, zealand, hunted, the, flightless, finsch, s, duck, possibly, to, extinction, though, rat, predation, may, also, have, contributed, to, its, fate, a, similar, end, awaited, the, chatham, duck, a, species, with, reduced, flying, capabilities, which, went, extinct, shortly, after, its, island, was, colonised, by, polynesian, settlers, it, is, probable, that, duck, eggs, were, gathered, by, neolithic, hunter, gathers, as, well, though, hard, evidence, of, this, is, uncommon, in, many, areas, wild, ducks, including, ducks, farmed, and, released, into, the, wild, are, hunted, for, food, or, sport, by, shooting, or, by, being, trapped, using, duck, decoys, because, an, idle, floating, duck, or, a, duck, squatting, on, land, cannot, react, to, fly, or, move, quickly, a, sitting, duck, has, come, to, mean, an, easy, target, these, ducks, may, be, contaminated, by, pollutants, such, as, pcbs, ducks, have, many, economic, uses, being, farmed, for, their, meat, eggs, and, feathers, particularly, their, down, approximately, 3, billion, ducks, are, slaughtered, each, year, for, meat, worldwide, they, are, also, kept, and, bred, by, aviculturists, and, often, displayed, in, zoos, almost, all, the, varieties, of, domestic, ducks, are, descended, from, the, mallard, anas, platyrhynchos, apart, from, the, muscovy, duck, cairina, moschata, the, call, duck, is, another, example, of, a, domestic, duck, breed, its, name, comes, from, its, original, use, established, by, hunters, as, a, decoy, to, attract, wild, mallards, from, the, sky, into, traps, set, for, them, on, the, ground, the, call, duck, is, the, world, s, smallest, domestic, duck, breed, as, it, weighs, less, than, 1, kg, 2, 2, lb, ducks, appear, on, several, coats, of, arms, including, the, coat, of, arms, of, lub, na, latvia, and, the, coat, of, arms, of, f, gl, land, in, 2002, psychologist, richard, wiseman, and, colleagues, at, the, university, of, hertfordshire, uk, finished, a, year, long, laughlab, experiment, concluding, that, of, all, animals, ducks, attract, the, most, humor, and, silliness, he, said, if, you, re, going, to, tell, a, joke, involving, an, animal, make, it, a, duck, the, word, duck, may, have, become, an, inherently, funny, word, in, many, languages, possibly, because, ducks, are, seen, as, silly, in, their, looks, or, behavior, of, the, many, ducks, in, fiction, many, are, cartoon, characters, such, as, walt, disney, s, donald, duck, and, warner, bros, daffy, duck, howard, the, duck, started, as, a, comic, book, character, in, 1973, and, was, made, into, a, movie, in, 1986, the, 1992, disney, film, the, mighty, ducks, starring, emilio, estevez, chose, the, duck, as, the, mascot, for, the, fictional, youth, hockey, team, who, are, protagonists, of, the, movie, based, on, the, duck, being, described, as, a, fierce, fighter, this, led, to, the, duck, becoming, the, nickname, and, mascot, for, the, eventual, national, hockey, league, professional, team, of, the, anaheim, ducks, who, were, founded, with, the, name, the, mighty, ducks, of, anaheim, the, duck, is, also, the, nickname, of, the, university, of, oregon, sports, teams, as, well, as, the, long, island, ducks, minor, league, baseball, team
