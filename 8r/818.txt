the, tasmanian, devil, sarcophilus, harrisii, palawa, kani, purinina, is, a, carnivorous, marsupial, of, the, family, dasyuridae, it, was, formerly, present, across, mainland, australia, but, became, extinct, there, around, 3, 500, years, ago, it, is, now, confined, to, the, island, of, tasmania, the, size, of, a, small, dog, the, tasmanian, devil, became, the, largest, carnivorous, marsupial, in, the, world, following, the, extinction, of, the, thylacine, in, 1936, it, is, related, to, quolls, and, distantly, related, to, the, thylacine, it, is, characterised, by, its, stocky, and, muscular, build, black, fur, pungent, odour, extremely, loud, and, disturbing, screech, keen, sense, of, smell, and, ferocity, when, feeding, the, tasmanian, devil, s, large, head, and, neck, allow, it, to, generate, among, the, strongest, bites, per, unit, body, mass, of, any, extant, predatory, land, mammal, it, hunts, prey, and, scavenges, on, carrion, although, devils, are, usually, solitary, they, sometimes, eat, and, defecate, together, in, a, communal, location, unlike, most, other, dasyurids, the, devil, thermoregulates, effectively, and, is, active, during, the, middle, of, the, day, without, overheating, despite, its, rotund, appearance, it, is, capable, of, surprising, speed, and, endurance, and, can, climb, trees, and, swim, across, rivers, devils, are, not, monogamous, males, fight, one, another, for, females, and, guard, their, partners, to, prevent, female, infidelity, females, can, ovulate, three, times, in, as, many, weeks, during, the, mating, season, and, 80, of, two, year, old, females, are, seen, to, be, pregnant, during, the, annual, mating, season, females, average, four, breeding, seasons, in, their, life, and, give, birth, to, 20, to, 30, live, young, after, three, weeks, gestation, the, newborn, are, pink, lack, fur, have, indistinct, facial, features, and, weigh, around, 0, 20, g, 0, 0071, oz, at, birth, as, there, are, only, four, nipples, in, the, pouch, competition, is, fierce, and, few, newborns, survive, the, young, grow, rapidly, and, are, ejected, from, the, pouch, after, around, 100, days, weighing, roughly, 200, g, 7, 1, oz, the, young, become, independent, after, around, nine, months, in, 1941, devils, became, officially, protected, since, the, late, 1990s, the, devil, facial, tumour, disease, dftd, has, drastically, reduced, the, population, and, now, threatens, the, survival, of, the, species, which, in, 2008, was, declared, to, be, endangered, starting, in, 2013, tasmanian, devils, are, again, being, sent, to, zoos, around, the, world, as, part, of, the, australian, government, s, save, the, tasmanian, devil, program, the, devil, is, an, iconic, symbol, of, tasmania, and, many, organisations, groups, and, products, associated, with, the, state, use, the, animal, in, their, logos, it, is, seen, as, an, important, attractor, of, tourists, to, tasmania, and, has, come, to, worldwide, attention, through, the, looney, tunes, character, of, the, same, name, believing, it, to, be, a, type, of, opossum, naturalist, george, harris, wrote, the, first, published, description, of, the, tasmanian, devil, in, 1807, naming, it, didelphis, ursina, due, to, its, bearlike, characteristics, such, as, the, round, ear, he, had, earlier, made, a, presentation, on, the, topic, at, the, zoological, society, of, london, however, that, particular, binomial, name, had, been, given, to, the, common, wombat, later, reclassified, as, vombatus, ursinus, by, george, shaw, in, 1800, and, was, hence, unavailable, in, 1838, a, specimen, was, named, dasyurus, laniarius, by, richard, owen, but, by, 1877, he, had, relegated, it, to, sarcophilus, the, modern, tasmanian, devil, was, named, sarcophilus, harrisii, harris, s, flesh, lover, by, french, naturalist, pierre, boitard, in, 1841, a, later, revision, of, the, devil, s, taxonomy, published, in, 1987, attempted, to, change, the, species, name, to, sarcophilus, laniarius, based, on, mainland, fossil, records, of, only, a, few, animals, however, this, was, not, accepted, by, the, taxonomic, community, at, large, the, name, s, harrisii, has, been, retained, and, s, laniarius, relegated, to, a, fossil, species, beelzebub, s, pup, was, an, early, vernacular, name, given, to, it, by, the, explorers, of, tasmania, in, reference, to, a, religious, figure, who, is, a, prince, of, hell, and, an, assistant, of, satan, the, explorers, first, encountered, the, animal, by, hearing, its, far, reaching, vocalisations, at, night, related, names, that, were, used, in, the, 19th, century, were, sarcophilus, satanicus, satanic, flesh, lover, and, diabolus, ursinus, bear, devil, all, due, to, early, misconceptions, of, the, species, as, implacably, vicious, the, tasmanian, devil, sarcophilus, harrisii, belongs, to, the, family, dasyuridae, the, genus, sarcophilus, contains, two, other, species, known, only, from, pleistocene, fossils, s, laniarius, and, s, moomaensis, phylogenetic, analysis, shows, that, the, tasmanian, devil, is, most, closely, related, to, quolls, according, to, pemberton, the, possible, ancestors, of, the, devil, may, have, needed, to, climb, trees, to, acquire, food, leading, to, a, growth, in, size, and, the, hopping, gait, of, many, marsupials, he, speculated, that, these, adaptations, may, have, caused, the, contemporary, devil, s, peculiar, gait, the, specific, lineage, of, the, tasmanian, devil, is, theorised, to, have, emerged, during, the, miocene, molecular, evidence, suggesting, a, split, from, the, ancestors, of, quolls, between, 10, and, 15, million, years, ago, when, severe, climate, change, came, to, bear, in, australia, transforming, the, climate, from, warm, and, moist, to, an, arid, dry, ice, age, resulting, in, mass, extinctions, as, most, of, their, prey, died, of, the, cold, only, a, few, carnivores, survived, including, the, ancestors, of, the, quoll, and, thylacine, it, is, speculated, that, the, devil, lineage, may, have, arisen, at, this, time, to, fill, a, niche, in, the, ecosystem, as, a, scavenger, that, disposed, of, carrion, left, behind, by, the, selective, eating, thylacine, the, extinct, glaucodon, ballaratensis, of, the, pliocene, age, has, been, dubbed, an, intermediate, species, between, the, quoll, and, devil, fossil, deposits, in, limestone, caves, at, naracoorte, south, australia, dating, to, the, miocene, include, specimens, of, s, laniarius, which, were, around, 15, larger, and, 50, heavier, than, modern, devils, older, specimens, believed, to, be, 50, 70, 000, years, old, were, found, in, darling, downs, in, queensland, and, in, western, australia, it, is, not, clear, whether, the, modern, devil, evolved, from, s, laniarius, or, whether, they, coexisted, at, the, time, richard, owen, argued, for, the, latter, hypothesis, in, the, 19th, century, based, on, fossils, found, in, 1877, in, new, south, wales, large, bones, attributed, to, s, moornaensis, have, been, found, in, new, south, wales, and, it, has, been, conjectured, that, these, two, extinct, larger, species, may, have, hunted, and, scavenged, it, is, known, that, there, were, several, genera, of, thylacine, millions, of, years, ago, and, that, they, ranged, in, size, the, smaller, being, more, reliant, on, foraging, as, the, devil, and, thylacine, are, similar, the, extinction, of, the, co, existing, thylacine, genera, has, been, cited, as, evidence, for, an, analogous, history, for, the, devils, it, has, been, speculated, that, the, smaller, size, of, s, laniarius, and, s, moornaensis, allowed, them, to, adapt, to, the, changing, conditions, more, effectively, and, survive, longer, than, the, corresponding, thylacines, as, the, extinction, of, these, two, species, came, at, a, similar, time, to, human, habitation, of, australia, hunting, by, humans, and, land, clearance, have, been, mooted, as, possible, causes, critics, of, this, theory, point, out, that, as, indigenous, australians, only, developed, boomerangs, and, spears, for, hunting, around, 10, 000, years, ago, a, critical, fall, in, numbers, due, to, systematic, hunting, is, unlikely, they, also, point, out, that, caves, inhabited, by, aborigines, have, a, low, proportion, of, bones, and, rock, paintings, of, devils, and, suggest, that, this, is, an, indication, that, it, was, not, a, large, part, of, indigenous, lifestyle, a, scientific, report, in, 1910, claimed, that, aborigines, preferred, the, meat, of, herbivores, rather, than, carnivores, the, other, main, theory, for, the, extinction, was, that, it, was, due, to, the, climate, change, brought, on, by, the, most, recent, ice, age, the, tasmanian, devil, s, genome, was, sequenced, in, 2010, by, the, wellcome, trust, sanger, institute, like, all, dasyurids, the, devil, has, 14, chromosomes, devils, have, a, low, genetic, diversity, compared, to, other, australian, marsupials, and, placental, carnivores, this, is, consistent, with, a, founder, effect, as, allelic, size, ranges, were, low, and, nearly, continuous, throughout, all, subpopulations, measured, allelic, diversity, was, measured, at, 2, 7, 3, 3, in, the, subpopulations, sampled, and, heterozygosity, was, in, the, range, 0, 386, 0, 467, according, to, a, study, by, menna, jones, gene, flow, appears, extensive, up, to, 50, km, 31, mi, meaning, a, high, assignment, rate, to, source, or, close, neighbour, populations, in, agreement, with, movement, data, at, larger, scales, 150, 250, km, or, 93, 155, mi, gene, flow, is, reduced, but, there, is, no, evidence, for, isolation, by, distance, island, effects, may, also, have, contributed, to, their, low, genetic, diversity, periods, of, low, population, density, may, also, have, created, moderate, population, bottlenecks, reducing, genetic, diversity, low, genetic, diversity, is, thought, to, have, been, a, feature, in, the, tasmanian, devil, population, since, the, mid, holocene, outbreaks, of, devil, facial, tumour, disease, dftd, cause, an, increase, in, inbreeding, a, sub, population, of, devils, in, the, north, west, of, the, state, is, genetically, distinct, from, other, devils, but, there, is, some, exchange, between, the, two, groups, one, strand, conformation, polymorphism, analysis, oscp, on, the, major, histocompatibility, complex, mhc, class, i, domain, taken, from, various, locations, across, tasmania, showed, 25, different, types, and, showed, a, different, pattern, of, mhc, types, in, north, western, tasmania, to, eastern, tasmania, those, devils, in, the, east, of, the, state, have, less, mhc, diversity, 30, are, of, the, same, type, as, the, tumour, type, 1, and, 24, are, of, type, a, seven, of, every, ten, devils, in, the, east, are, of, type, a, d, g, or, 1, which, are, linked, to, dftd, whereas, only, 55, of, the, western, devils, fall, into, these, mhc, categories, of, the, 25, mhc, types, 40, are, exclusive, to, the, western, devils, although, the, north, west, population, is, less, genetically, diverse, overall, it, has, higher, mhc, gene, diversity, which, allows, them, to, mount, an, immune, response, to, dftd, according, to, this, research, mixing, the, devils, may, increase, the, chance, of, disease, of, the, fifteen, different, regions, in, tasmania, surveyed, in, this, research, six, were, in, the, eastern, half, of, the, island, in, the, eastern, half, epping, forest, had, only, two, different, types, 75, being, type, o, in, the, buckland, nugent, area, only, three, types, were, present, and, there, were, an, average, of, 5, 33, different, types, per, location, in, contrast, in, the, west, cape, sorell, yielded, three, types, and, togari, north, christmas, hills, yielded, six, but, the, other, seven, sites, all, had, at, least, eight, mhc, types, and, west, pencil, pine, had, 15, types, there, was, an, average, of, 10, 11, mhc, types, per, site, in, the, west, recent, research, has, suggested, that, the, wild, population, of, devils, are, rapidly, evolving, a, resistance, to, dftd, the, tasmanian, devil, is, the, largest, surviving, carnivorous, marsupial, it, has, a, squat, thick, build, with, a, large, head, and, a, tail, which, is, about, half, its, body, length, unusually, for, a, marsupial, its, forelegs, are, slightly, longer, than, its, hind, legs, and, devils, can, run, up, to, 13, km, h, 8, 1, mph, for, short, distances, the, fur, is, usually, black, often, with, irregular, white, patches, on, the, chest, and, rump, although, approximately, 16, of, wild, devils, do, not, have, white, patches, these, markings, suggest, that, the, devil, is, most, active, at, dawn, and, dusk, and, they, are, thought, to, draw, biting, attacks, toward, less, important, areas, of, the, body, as, fighting, between, devils, often, leads, to, a, concentration, of, scars, in, that, region, males, are, usually, larger, than, females, having, an, average, head, and, body, length, of, 652, mm, 25, 7, in, a, 258, mm, 10, 2, in, tail, and, an, average, weight, of, 8, kg, 18, lb, females, have, an, average, head, and, body, length, of, 570, mm, 22, in, a, 244, mm, 9, 6, in, tail, and, an, average, weight, of, 6, kg, 13, lb, although, devils, in, western, tasmania, tend, to, be, smaller, devils, have, five, long, toes, on, their, forefeet, four, pointing, to, the, front, and, one, coming, out, from, the, side, which, gives, the, devil, the, ability, to, hold, food, the, hind, feet, have, four, toes, and, the, devils, have, non, retractable, claws, the, stocky, devils, have, a, relatively, low, centre, of, mass, devils, are, fully, grown, at, two, years, of, age, and, few, devils, live, longer, than, five, years, in, the, wild, possibly, the, longest, lived, tasmanian, devil, recorded, was, coolah, a, male, devil, which, lived, in, captivity, for, more, than, seven, years, born, in, january, 1997, at, the, cincinnati, zoo, coolah, died, in, may, 2004, at, the, fort, wayne, children, s, zoo, the, devil, stores, body, fat, in, its, tail, and, healthy, devils, have, fat, tails, the, tail, is, largely, non, prehensile, and, is, important, to, its, physiology, social, behaviour, and, locomotion, it, acts, as, a, counterbalance, to, aid, stability, when, the, devil, is, moving, quickly, an, ano, genital, scent, gland, at, the, base, of, its, tail, is, used, to, mark, the, ground, behind, the, animal, with, its, strong, pungent, scent, the, male, has, external, testes, in, a, pouch, like, structure, formed, by, lateral, ventrocrural, folds, of, the, abdomen, which, partially, hides, and, protects, them, the, testes, are, subovoid, in, shape, and, the, mean, dimensions, of, 30, testes, of, adult, males, was, 3, 17, cm, 2, 57, cm, 1, 25, in, 1, 01, in, the, female, s, pouch, opens, backwards, and, is, present, throughout, its, life, unlike, some, other, dasyurids, the, tasmanian, devil, has, the, most, powerful, bite, relative, to, body, size, of, any, living, mammalian, carnivore, with, a, bite, force, quotient, of, 181, and, exerting, a, canine, bite, force, of, 553, n, 124, lb, f, the, jaw, can, open, to, 75, 80, degrees, allowing, the, devil, to, generate, the, large, amount, of, power, to, tear, meat, and, crush, bones, sufficient, force, to, allow, it, to, bite, through, thick, metal, wire, the, power, of, the, jaws, is, in, part, due, to, its, comparatively, large, head, the, teeth, and, jaws, of, tasmanian, devils, resemble, those, of, hyenas, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, dasyurid, teeth, resemble, those, of, primitive, marsupials, like, all, dasyurids, the, devil, has, prominent, canines, and, cheek, teeth, it, has, three, pairs, of, lower, incisors, and, four, pairs, of, upper, incisors, these, are, located, at, the, top, of, the, front, of, the, devil, s, mouth, like, dogs, it, has, 42, teeth, however, unlike, dogs, its, teeth, are, not, replaced, after, birth, but, grow, continuously, throughout, life, at, a, slow, rate, it, has, a, highly, carnivorous, dentition, and, trophic, adaptations, for, bone, consumption, the, devil, has, long, claws, that, allow, it, to, dig, burrows, and, seek, subterranean, food, easily, and, grip, prey, or, mates, strongly, the, teeth, and, claw, strength, allow, the, devil, to, attack, wombats, up, to, 30, kg, 66, lb, in, weight, the, large, neck, and, forebody, that, give, the, devil, its, strength, also, cause, this, strength, to, be, biased, towards, the, front, half, of, the, body, the, lopsided, awkward, shuffling, gait, of, the, devil, is, attributed, to, this, the, devil, has, long, whiskers, on, its, face, and, in, clumps, on, the, top, of, the, head, these, help, the, devil, locate, prey, when, foraging, in, the, dark, and, aid, in, detecting, when, other, devils, are, close, during, feeding, the, whiskers, can, extend, from, the, tip, of, the, chin, to, the, rear, of, the, jaw, and, can, cover, the, span, of, its, shoulder, hearing, is, its, dominant, sense, and, it, also, has, an, excellent, sense, of, smell, which, has, a, range, of, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, the, devil, unlike, other, marsupials, has, a, well, defined, saddle, shaped, ectotympanic, since, devils, hunt, at, night, their, vision, seems, to, be, strongest, in, black, and, white, in, these, conditions, they, can, detect, moving, objects, readily, but, have, difficulty, seeing, stationary, objects, the, tasmanian, devil, was, formerly, present, across, mainland, australia, but, became, extinct, there, 3, 500, years, ago, co, incident, with, the, extinction, of, the, thylacine, from, the, region, a, number, of, causal, factors, for, the, extinction, have, been, proposed, including, the, introduction, of, the, dingo, intensification, of, human, activity, as, well, as, climatic, change, devils, are, found, in, all, habitats, on, the, island, of, tasmania, including, the, outskirts, of, urban, areas, and, are, distributed, throughout, the, tasmanian, mainland, and, on, robbins, island, which, is, connected, to, mainland, tasmania, at, low, tide, the, north, western, population, is, located, west, of, the, forth, river, and, as, far, south, as, macquarie, heads, previously, they, were, present, on, bruny, island, from, the, 19th, century, but, there, have, been, no, records, of, them, after, 1900, they, were, illegally, introduced, to, badger, island, in, the, mid, 1990s, but, were, removed, by, the, tasmanian, government, by, 2007, although, the, badger, island, population, was, free, from, dftd, the, removed, individuals, were, returned, to, the, tasmanian, mainland, some, to, infected, areas, a, study, has, modelled, the, reintroduction, of, dftd, free, tasmanian, devils, to, the, australian, mainland, in, areas, where, dingoes, are, sparse, it, is, proposed, that, devils, would, have, fewer, impacts, on, both, livestock, and, native, fauna, than, dingoes, and, that, the, mainland, population, could, act, as, an, additional, insurance, population, in, september, 2015, 20, immunised, captive, bred, devils, were, released, into, narawntapu, national, park, tasmania, two, later, died, from, being, hit, by, cars, the, core, habitat, of, the, devils, is, considered, to, be, within, the, low, to, moderate, annual, rainfall, zone, of, eastern, and, north, western, tasmania, tasmanian, devils, particularly, like, dry, sclerophyll, forests, and, coastal, woodlands, although, they, are, not, found, at, the, highest, altitudes, of, tasmania, and, their, population, density, is, low, in, the, button, grass, plains, in, the, south, west, of, the, state, their, population, is, high, in, dry, or, mixed, sclerophyll, forests, and, coastal, heaths, devils, prefer, open, forest, to, tall, forest, and, dry, rather, than, wet, forests, they, are, also, found, near, roads, where, roadkill, is, prevalent, although, the, devils, themselves, are, often, killed, by, vehicles, while, retrieving, the, carrion, according, to, the, threatened, species, scientific, committee, their, versatility, means, that, habitat, modification, from, destruction, is, not, seen, as, a, major, threat, to, the, species, the, devil, is, directly, linked, to, the, dasyurotaenia, robusta, a, tapeworm, which, is, classified, as, rare, under, the, tasmanian, threatened, species, protection, act, 1995, this, tapeworm, is, found, only, in, devils, in, late, 2020, tasmanian, devils, were, reintroduced, to, mainland, australia, in, a, sanctuary, run, by, aussie, ark, in, the, barrington, tops, area, of, new, south, wales, this, was, the, first, time, devils, had, lived, on, the, australian, mainland, in, over, 3, 000, years, 26, adult, devils, were, released, into, the, 400, ha, 990, acres, protected, area, and, by, late, april, 2021, seven, joeys, had, been, born, with, up, to, 20, expected, by, the, end, of, the, year, the, tasmanian, devil, is, a, keystone, species, in, the, ecosystem, of, tasmania, it, is, a, nocturnal, and, crepuscular, hunter, spending, the, days, in, dense, bush, or, in, a, hole, it, has, been, speculated, that, nocturnalism, may, have, been, adopted, to, avoid, predation, by, eagles, and, humans, young, devils, are, predominantly, crepuscular, there, is, no, evidence, of, torpor, young, devils, can, climb, trees, but, this, becomes, more, difficult, as, they, grow, larger, devils, can, scale, trees, of, trunk, diameter, larger, than, 40, cm, 16, in, which, tend, to, have, no, small, side, branches, to, hang, onto, up, to, a, height, of, around, 2, 5, 3, m, 8, ft, 2, in, 9, ft, 10, in, devils, that, are, yet, to, reach, maturity, can, climb, shrubs, to, a, height, of, 4, m, 13, ft, and, can, climb, a, tree, to, 7, m, 23, ft, if, it, is, not, vertical, adult, devils, may, eat, young, devils, if, they, are, very, hungry, so, this, climbing, behaviour, may, be, an, adaptation, to, allow, young, devils, to, escape, devils, can, also, swim, and, have, been, observed, crossing, rivers, that, are, 50, m, 160, ft, in, width, including, icy, cold, waterways, apparently, enthusiastically, tasmanian, devils, do, not, form, packs, but, rather, spend, most, of, their, time, alone, once, weaned, classically, considered, as, solitary, animals, their, social, interactions, were, poorly, understood, however, a, field, study, published, in, 2009, shed, some, light, on, this, tasmanian, devils, in, narawntapu, national, park, were, fitted, with, proximity, sensing, radio, collars, which, recorded, their, interactions, with, other, devils, over, several, months, from, february, to, june, 2006, this, revealed, that, all, devils, were, part, of, a, single, huge, contact, network, characterised, by, male, female, interactions, during, mating, season, while, female, female, interactions, were, the, most, common, at, other, times, although, frequency, and, patterns, of, contact, did, not, vary, markedly, between, seasons, previously, thought, to, fight, over, food, males, only, rarely, interacted, with, other, males, hence, all, devils, in, a, region, are, part, of, a, single, social, network, they, are, considered, to, be, non, territorial, in, general, but, females, are, territorial, around, their, dens, this, allows, a, higher, total, mass, of, devils, to, occupy, a, given, area, than, territorial, animals, without, conflict, tasmanian, devils, instead, occupy, a, home, range, in, a, period, of, between, two, and, four, weeks, devils, home, ranges, are, estimated, to, vary, between, 4, and, 27, km, 2, 1, 5, and, 10, 4, sq, mi, with, an, average, of, 13, km, 2, 5, 0, sq, mi, the, location, and, geometry, of, these, areas, depend, on, the, distribution, of, food, particularly, wallabies, and, pademelons, nearby, devils, use, three, or, four, dens, regularly, dens, formerly, owned, by, wombats, are, especially, prized, as, maternity, dens, because, of, their, security, dense, vegetation, near, creeks, thick, grass, tussocks, and, caves, are, also, used, as, dens, adult, devils, use, the, same, dens, for, life, it, is, believed, that, as, a, secure, den, is, highly, prized, some, may, have, been, used, for, several, centuries, by, generations, of, animals, studies, have, suggested, that, food, security, is, less, important, than, den, security, as, habitat, destruction, that, affects, the, latter, has, had, more, effect, on, mortality, rates, young, pups, remain, in, one, den, with, their, mother, and, other, devils, are, mobile, changing, dens, every, 1, 3, days, and, travelling, a, mean, distance, of, 8, 6, km, 5, 3, mi, every, night, however, there, are, also, reports, that, an, upper, bound, can, be, 50, km, 31, mi, per, night, they, choose, to, travel, through, lowlands, saddles, and, along, the, banks, of, creeks, particularly, preferring, carved, out, tracks, and, livestock, paths, and, eschewing, steep, slopes, and, rocky, terrain, the, amount, of, movement, is, believed, to, be, similar, throughout, the, year, except, for, mothers, who, have, given, birth, recently, the, similarity, in, travel, distances, for, males, and, females, is, unusual, for, sexually, dimorphic, solitary, carnivores, as, a, male, needs, more, food, he, will, spend, more, time, eating, than, travelling, devils, typically, make, circuits, of, their, home, range, during, their, hunts, in, areas, near, human, habitation, they, are, known, to, steal, clothes, blankets, and, pillows, and, take, them, for, use, in, dens, in, wooden, buildings, while, the, dasyurids, have, similar, diet, and, anatomy, differing, body, sizes, affect, thermoregulation, and, thus, behaviour, in, ambient, temperatures, between, 5, and, 30, c, 41, and, 86, f, the, devil, was, able, to, maintain, a, body, temperature, between, 37, 4, and, 38, c, 99, 3, and, 100, 4, f, when, the, temperature, was, raised, to, 40, c, 104, f, and, the, humidity, to, 50, the, devil, s, body, temperature, spiked, upwards, by, 2, c, 3, 6, f, within, 60, minutes, but, then, steadily, decreased, back, to, the, starting, temperature, after, a, further, two, hours, and, remained, there, for, two, more, hours, during, this, time, the, devil, drank, water, and, showed, no, visible, signs, of, discomfort, leading, scientists, to, believe, that, sweating, and, evaporative, cooling, is, its, primary, means, of, heat, dissipation, a, later, study, found, that, devils, pant, but, do, not, sweat, to, release, heat, in, contrast, many, other, marsupials, were, unable, to, keep, their, body, temperatures, down, as, the, smaller, animals, have, to, live, in, hotter, and, more, arid, conditions, to, which, they, are, less, well, adapted, they, take, up, a, nocturnal, lifestyle, and, drop, their, body, temperatures, during, the, day, whereas, the, devil, is, active, in, the, day, and, its, body, temperature, varies, by, 1, 8, c, 3, 2, f, from, its, minimum, at, night, to, the, maximum, in, the, middle, of, the, day, the, standard, metabolic, rate, of, a, tasmanian, devil, is, 141, kj, kg, 15, 3, kcal, lb, per, day, many, times, lower, than, smaller, marsupials, a, 5, kg, 11, lb, devil, uses, 712, kj, 170, 000, cal, per, day, the, field, metabolic, rate, is, 407, kj, kg, 44, 1, kcal, lb, along, with, quolls, tasmanian, devils, have, a, metabolic, rate, comparable, to, non, carnivorous, marsupials, of, a, similar, size, this, differs, from, placental, carnivores, which, have, comparatively, high, basal, metabolic, rates, a, study, of, devils, showed, a, loss, of, weight, from, 7, 9, to, 7, 1, kg, 17, to, 16, lb, from, summer, to, winter, but, in, the, same, time, daily, energy, consumption, increased, from, 2, 591, to, 2, 890, kj, 619, 000, to, 691, 000, cal, this, is, equivalent, to, an, increase, in, food, consumption, from, 518, to, 578, g, 18, 3, to, 20, 4, oz, the, diet, is, protein, based, with, 70, water, content, for, every, 1, g, 0, 035, oz, of, insects, consumed, 3, 5, kj, 840, cal, of, energy, are, produced, while, a, corresponding, amount, of, wallaby, meat, generated, 5, 0, kj, 1, 200, cal, in, terms, of, its, body, mass, the, devil, eats, only, a, quarter, of, the, eastern, quoll, s, intake, allowing, it, to, survive, longer, during, food, shortages, tasmanian, devils, can, take, prey, up, to, the, size, of, a, small, kangaroo, but, in, practice, they, are, opportunistic, and, eat, carrion, more, often, than, they, hunt, live, prey, although, the, devil, favours, wombats, because, of, the, ease, of, predation, and, high, fat, content, it, will, eat, all, small, native, mammals, such, as, wallabies, bettong, and, potoroos, domestic, mammals, including, sheep, and, rabbits, birds, including, penguins, fish, fruit, vegetable, matter, insects, tadpoles, frogs, and, reptiles, their, diet, is, widely, varied, and, depends, on, the, food, available, before, the, extinction, of, the, thylacine, the, tasmanian, devil, ate, thylacine, joeys, left, alone, in, dens, when, their, parents, were, away, this, may, have, helped, to, hasten, the, extinction, of, the, thylacine, which, also, ate, devils, they, are, known, to, hunt, water, rats, by, the, sea, and, forage, on, dead, fish, that, have, been, washed, ashore, near, human, habitation, they, can, also, steal, shoes, and, chew, on, them, and, eat, the, legs, of, otherwise, robust, sheep, that, have, slipped, in, wooden, shearing, sheds, leaving, their, legs, dangling, below, other, unusual, matter, observed, in, devil, scats, includes, collars, and, tags, of, devoured, animals, intact, echidna, spines, pencil, plastic, and, jeans, devils, can, bite, through, metal, traps, and, tend, to, reserve, their, strong, jaws, for, escaping, captivity, rather, than, breaking, into, food, storage, due, to, their, relative, lack, of, speed, they, cannot, run, down, a, wallaby, or, a, rabbit, but, they, can, attack, animals, that, have, become, slow, due, to, illness, they, survey, flocks, of, sheep, by, sniffing, them, from, 10, 15, m, 33, 49, ft, away, and, attack, if, the, prey, is, ill, the, sheep, stamp, their, feet, in, a, show, of, strength, despite, their, lack, of, extreme, speed, there, have, been, reports, that, devils, can, run, at, 25, km, h, 16, mph, for, 1, 5, km, 0, 93, mi, and, it, has, been, conjectured, that, before, european, immigration, and, the, introduction, of, livestock, vehicles, and, roadkill, they, would, have, had, to, chase, other, native, animals, at, a, reasonable, pace, to, find, food, pemberton, has, reported, that, they, can, average, 10, km, h, 6, 2, mph, for, extended, periods, on, several, nights, per, week, and, that, they, run, for, long, distances, before, sitting, still, for, up, to, half, an, hour, something, that, has, been, interpreted, as, evidence, of, ambush, predation, devils, can, dig, to, forage, corpses, in, one, case, digging, down, to, eat, the, corpse, of, a, buried, horse, that, had, died, due, to, illness, they, are, known, to, eat, animal, cadavers, by, first, ripping, out, the, digestive, system, which, is, the, softest, part, of, the, anatomy, and, they, often, reside, in, the, resulting, cavity, while, they, are, eating, on, average, devils, eat, about, 15, of, their, body, weight, each, day, although, they, can, eat, up, to, 40, of, their, body, weight, in, 30, minutes, if, the, opportunity, arises, this, means, they, can, become, very, heavy, and, lethargic, after, a, large, meal, in, this, state, they, tend, to, waddle, away, slowly, and, lie, down, becoming, easy, to, approach, this, has, led, to, a, belief, that, such, eating, habits, became, possible, due, to, the, lack, of, a, predator, to, attack, such, bloated, individuals, tasmanian, devils, can, eliminate, all, traces, of, a, carcass, of, a, smaller, animal, devouring, the, bones, and, fur, if, desired, in, this, respect, devils, have, earned, the, gratitude, of, tasmanian, farmers, as, the, speed, at, which, they, clean, a, carcass, helps, prevent, the, spread, of, insects, that, might, otherwise, harm, livestock, some, of, these, dead, animals, are, disposed, of, when, the, devils, haul, off, the, excess, feed, back, to, their, residence, to, continue, eating, at, a, later, time, the, diet, of, a, devil, can, vary, substantially, for, males, and, females, and, seasonally, according, to, studies, at, cradle, mountain, in, winter, males, prefer, medium, mammals, over, larger, ones, with, a, ratio, of, 4, 5, but, in, summer, they, prefer, larger, prey, in, a, 7, 2, ratio, these, two, categories, accounted, for, more, than, 95, of, the, diet, females, are, less, inclined, to, target, large, prey, but, have, the, same, seasonal, bias, in, winter, large, and, medium, mammals, account, for, 25, and, 58, each, with, 7, small, mammals, and, 10, birds, in, summer, the, first, two, categories, account, for, 61, and, 37, respectively, juvenile, devils, are, sometimes, known, to, climb, trees, in, addition, to, small, vertebrates, and, invertebrates, juveniles, climb, trees, to, eat, grubs, and, birds, eggs, juveniles, have, also, been, observed, climbing, into, nests, and, capturing, birds, throughout, the, year, adult, devils, derive, 16, 2, of, their, biomass, intake, from, arboreal, species, almost, all, of, which, is, possum, meat, just, 1, 0, being, large, birds, from, february, to, july, subadult, devils, derive, 35, 8, of, their, biomass, intake, from, arboreal, life, 12, 2, being, small, birds, and, 23, 2, being, possums, female, devils, in, winter, source, 40, 0, of, their, intake, from, arboreal, species, including, 26, 7, from, possums, and, 8, 9, from, various, birds, not, all, of, these, animals, were, caught, while, they, were, in, trees, but, this, high, figure, for, females, which, is, higher, than, for, male, spotted, tailed, quolls, during, the, same, season, is, unusual, as, the, devil, has, inferior, tree, climbing, skills, although, they, hunt, alone, there, have, been, unsubstantiated, claims, of, communal, hunting, where, one, devil, drives, prey, out, of, its, habitat, and, an, accomplice, attacks, eating, is, a, social, event, for, the, tasmanian, devil, this, combination, of, a, solitary, animal, that, eats, communally, makes, the, devil, unique, among, carnivores, much, of, the, noise, attributed, to, the, animal, is, a, result, of, raucous, communal, eating, at, which, up, to, 12, individuals, can, gather, although, groups, of, two, to, five, are, common, it, can, often, be, heard, several, kilometres, away, this, has, been, interpreted, as, notifications, to, colleagues, to, share, in, the, meal, so, that, food, is, not, wasted, by, rot, and, energy, is, saved, the, amount, of, noise, is, correlated, to, the, size, of, the, carcass, the, devils, eat, in, accordance, with, a, system, juveniles, are, active, at, dusk, so, they, tend, to, reach, the, source, before, the, adults, typically, the, dominant, animal, eats, until, it, is, satiated, and, leaves, fighting, off, any, challengers, in, the, meantime, defeated, animals, run, into, the, bush, with, their, hair, and, tail, erect, their, conqueror, in, pursuit, and, biting, their, victim, s, rear, where, possible, disputes, are, less, common, as, the, food, source, increases, as, the, motive, appears, to, be, getting, sufficient, food, rather, than, oppressing, other, devils, when, quolls, are, eating, a, carcass, devils, will, tend, to, chase, them, away, this, is, a, substantial, problem, for, spotted, tailed, quolls, as, they, kill, relatively, large, possums, and, cannot, finish, their, meal, before, devils, arrive, in, contrast, the, smaller, eastern, quolls, prey, on, much, smaller, victims, and, can, complete, feeding, before, devils, turn, up, this, is, seen, as, a, possible, reason, for, the, relatively, small, population, of, spotted, tailed, quolls, a, study, of, feeding, devils, identified, twenty, physical, postures, including, their, characteristic, vicious, yawn, and, eleven, different, vocal, sounds, including, clicks, shrieks, and, various, types, of, growls, that, devils, use, to, communicate, as, they, feed, they, usually, establish, dominance, by, sound, and, physical, posturing, although, fighting, does, occur, the, white, patches, on, the, devil, are, visible, to, the, night, vision, of, its, colleagues, chemical, gestures, are, also, used, adult, males, are, the, most, aggressive, and, scarring, is, common, they, can, also, stand, on, their, hind, legs, and, push, each, other, s, shoulders, with, their, front, legs, and, heads, similar, to, sumo, wrestling, torn, flesh, around, the, mouth, and, teeth, as, well, as, punctures, in, the, rump, can, sometimes, be, observed, although, these, can, also, be, inflicted, during, breeding, fights, digestion, is, very, fast, in, dasyurids, and, for, the, tasmanian, devil, the, few, hours, taken, for, food, to, pass, through, the, small, gut, is, a, long, period, in, comparison, to, some, other, dasyuridae, devils, are, known, to, return, to, the, same, places, to, defecate, and, to, do, so, at, a, communal, location, called, a, devil, latrine, it, is, believed, that, the, communal, defecation, may, be, a, means, of, communication, that, is, not, well, understood, devil, scats, are, very, large, compared, to, body, size, they, are, on, average, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, long, but, there, have, been, samples, that, are, 25, cm, 9, 8, in, in, length, they, are, characteristically, grey, in, colour, due, to, digested, bones, or, have, bone, fragments, included, owen, and, pemberton, believe, that, the, relationship, between, tasmanian, devils, and, thylacines, was, close, and, complex, as, they, competed, directly, for, prey, and, probably, also, for, shelter, the, thylacines, preyed, on, the, devils, the, devils, scavenged, from, the, thylacine, s, kills, and, the, devils, ate, thylacine, young, menna, jones, hypothesises, that, the, two, species, shared, the, role, of, apex, predator, in, tasmania, wedge, tailed, eagles, have, a, similar, carrion, based, diet, to, the, devils, and, are, regarded, as, competitors, quolls, and, devils, are, also, seen, as, being, in, direct, competition, in, tasmania, jones, believed, that, the, quoll, has, evolved, into, its, current, state, in, just, 100, 200, generations, of, around, two, years, as, determined, by, the, equal, spacing, effect, on, the, devil, the, largest, species, the, spotted, tail, quoll, and, the, smallest, species, the, eastern, quoll, both, the, tasmanian, devil, and, the, quolls, appears, to, have, evolved, up, to, 50, times, faster, than, the, average, evolutionary, rate, amongst, mammals, females, start, to, breed, when, they, reach, sexual, maturity, typically, in, their, second, year, at, this, point, they, become, fertile, once, a, year, producing, multiple, ova, while, in, heat, as, prey, is, most, abundant, in, spring, and, early, summer, the, devil, s, reproductive, cycle, starts, in, march, or, april, so, that, the, end, of, the, weaning, period, coincides, with, the, maximisation, of, food, supplies, in, the, wild, for, the, newly, roaming, young, devils, occurring, in, march, mating, takes, places, in, sheltered, locations, during, both, day, and, night, males, fight, over, females, in, the, breeding, season, and, female, devils, will, mate, with, the, dominant, male, females, can, ovulate, up, to, three, times, in, a, 21, day, period, and, copulation, can, take, five, days, one, instance, of, a, couple, being, in, the, mating, den, for, eight, days, has, been, recorded, devils, are, not, monogamous, and, females, will, mate, with, several, males, if, not, guarded, after, mating, males, also, reproduce, with, several, females, during, a, season, females, have, been, shown, to, be, selective, in, an, attempt, to, ensure, the, best, genetic, offspring, for, example, fighting, off, the, advances, of, smaller, males, males, often, keep, their, mates, in, custody, in, the, den, or, take, them, along, if, they, need, to, drink, lest, they, engage, in, infidelity, males, can, produce, up, to, 16, offspring, over, their, lifetime, while, females, average, four, mating, seasons, and, 12, offspring, theoretically, this, means, that, a, devil, population, can, double, on, an, annual, basis, and, make, the, species, insulated, against, high, mortality, the, pregnancy, rate, is, high, 80, of, two, year, old, females, were, observed, with, newborns, in, their, pouches, during, the, mating, season, more, recent, studies, of, breeding, place, the, mating, season, between, february, and, june, as, opposed, to, between, february, and, march, gestation, lasts, 21, days, and, devils, give, birth, to, 20, 30, young, standing, up, each, weighing, approximately, 0, 18, 0, 24, g, 0, 0063, 0, 0085, oz, embryonic, diapause, does, not,

the, young, are, born, competition, is, fierce, as, they, move, from, the, vagina, in, a, sticky, flow, of, mucus, to, the, pouch, once, inside, the, pouch, they, each, remain, attached, to, a, nipple, for, the, next, 100, days, the, female, tasmanian, devil, s, pouch, like, that, of, the, wombat, opens, to, the, rear, so, it, is, physically, difficult, for, the, female, to, interact, with, young, inside, the, pouch, despite, the, large, litter, at, birth, the, female, has, only, four, nipples, so, there, are, never, more, than, four, babies, nursing, in, the, pouch, and, the, older, a, female, devil, gets, the, smaller, her, litters, will, become, once, the, young, have, made, contact, with, the, nipple, it, expands, resulting, in, the, oversized, nipple, being, firmly, clamped, inside, the, newborn, and, ensuring, that, the, newborn, does, not, fall, out, of, the, pouch, on, average, more, females, survive, than, males, and, up, to, 60, of, young, do, not, survive, to,

and, heavily, pigmented, at, 15, days, the, external, parts, of, the, ear, are, visible, although, these, are, attached, to, the, head, and, do, not, open, out, until, the, devil, is, around, 10, weeks, old, the, ear, begins, blackening, after, around, 40, days, when, it, is, less, than, 1, cm, 0, 39, in, long, and, by, the, time, the, ear, becomes, erect, it, is, between, 1, 2, and, 1, 6, cm, 0, 47, and, 0, 63, in, eyelids, are, apparent, at, 16, days, whiskers, at, 17, days, and, the, lips, at, 20, days, the, devils, can, make, squeaking, noises, after, eight, weeks, and, after, around, 10, 11, weeks, the, lips, can, open, despite, the, formation, of, eyelids, they, do, not, open, for, three, months, although, eyelashes, form, at, around, 50, days, the, young, up, to, this, point, they, are, pink, start, to, grow, fur, at, 49, days, and, have, a, full, coat, by, 90, days, the, fur, growing, process, starts, at, the, snout, and, proceeds, back, through, the, body, although, the, tail, attains, fur, before, the, rump, which, is, the, last, part, of, the, body, to, become, covered, just, before, the, start, of, the, furring, process, the, colour, of, the, bare, devil, s, skin, will, darken, and, become, black, or, dark, grey, in, the, tail, the, devils, have, a, complete, set, of, facial, vibrissae, and, ulnar, carpels, although, it, is, devoid, of, anconeal, vibrissae,

the, devils, stay, outside, the, pouch, but, they, remain, in, the, den, for, around, another, three, months, first, venturing, outside, the, den, between, october, and, december, before, becoming, independent, in, january, during, this, transitional, phase, out, of, the, pouch, the, young, devils, are, relatively, safe, from, predation, as, they, are, generally, accompanied, when, the, mother, is, hunting, they, can, stay, inside, a, shelter, or, come, along, often, riding, on, their, mother, s, back, during, this, time, they, continue, to, drink, their, mother, s, milk, female, devils, are, occupied, with, raising, their, young, for, all, but, approximately, six, weeks, of, the, year, the, milk, contains, a, higher, amount, of, iron, than, the, milk, of, placental, mammals, in, guiler, s, 1970, study, no, females, died, while, rearing, their, offspring, in, the, pouch, after, leaving, the, pouch, the, devils, grow, by, around, 0, 5, kg, 1, 1, lb, a, month, until, they, are, six, months, old, while, most, pups, will, survive, to, be, weaned, guiler, reported, that, up, to, three, fifths, of, devils, do, not, reach, maturity, as, juveniles, are, more, crepuscular, than, adults, their, appearance, in, the, open, during, summer, gives, the, impression, to, humans, of, a, population, boom, a, study, into, the, success, of, translocated, devils, that, were, orphaned, and, raised, in, captivity, found, that, young, devils, who, had, consistently, engaged, with, new, experiences, while, they, were, in, captivity, survived, better, than, young, who, had, not, the, cause, of, the, devil, s, disappearance, from, the, mainland, is, unclear, but, their, decline, seems, to, coincide, with, an, abrupt, change, in, climate, and, the, expansion, across, the, mainland, of, indigenous, australians, and, dingoes, however, whether, it, was, direct, hunting, by, people, competition, with, dingoes, changes, brought, about, by, the, increasing, human, population, who, by, 3000, years, ago, were, using, all, habitat, types, across, the, continent, or, a, combination, of, all, three, is, unknown, devils, had, coexisted, with, dingoes, on, the, mainland, for, around, 3000, years, brown, has, also, proposed, that, the, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, enso, grew, stronger, during, the, holocene, and, that, the, devil, as, a, scavenger, with, a, short, life, span, was, highly, sensitive, to, this, in, dingo, free, tasmania, carnivorous, marsupials, were, still, active, when, europeans, arrived, the, extermination, of, the, thylacine, after, the, arrival, of, the, europeans, is, well, known, but, the, tasmanian, devil, was, threatened, as, well, habitat, disruption, can, expose, dens, where, mothers, raise, their, young, this, increases, mortality, as, the, mother, leaves, the, disturbed, den, with, her, pups, clinging, to, her, back, making, them, more, vulnerable, cancer, in, general, is, a, common, cause, of, death, in, devils, in, 2008, high, levels, of, potentially, carcinogenic, flame, retardant, chemicals, were, found, in, tasmanian, devils, preliminary, results, of, tests, ordered, by, the, tasmanian, government, on, chemicals, found, in, fat, tissue, from, 16, devils, have, revealed, high, levels, of, hexabromobiphenyl, bb153, and, reasonably, high, levels, of, decabromodiphenyl, ether, bde209, the, save, the, tasmanian, devil, appeal, is, the, official, fundraising, entity, for, the, save, the, tasmanian, devil, program, the, priority, is, to, ensure, the, survival, of, the, tasmanian, devil, in, the, wild, at, least, two, major, population, declines, possibly, due, to, disease, epidemics, have, occurred, in, recorded, history, in, 1909, and, 1950, the, devil, was, also, reported, as, scarce, in, the, 1850s, it, is, difficult, to, estimate, the, size, of, the, devil, population, in, the, mid, 1990s, the, population, was, estimated, at, 130, 000, 150, 000, animals, but, this, is, likely, to, have, been, an, overestimate, the, tasmanian, devil, s, population, has, been, calculated, in, 2008, by, tasmania, s, department, of, primary, industries, and, water, as, being, in, the, range, of, 10, 000, to, 100, 000, individuals, with, 20, 000, to, 50, 000, mature, individuals, being, likely, experts, estimate, that, the, devil, has, suffered, a, more, than, 80, decline, in, its, population, since, the, mid, 1990s, and, that, only, around, 10, 000, 15, 000, remain, in, the, wild, as, of, 2008, the, species, was, listed, as, vulnerable, under, the, tasmanian, threatened, species, protection, act, 1995, in, 2005, and, the, australian, environment, protection, and, biodiversity, conservation, act, 1999, in, 2006, which, means, that, it, is, at, risk, of, extinction, in, the, medium, term, the, iucn, classified, the, tasmanian, devil, in, the, lower, risk, least, concern, category, in, 1996, but, in, 2009, they, reclassified, it, as, endangered, appropriate, wildlife, refuges, such, as, savage, river, national, park, in, north, west, tasmania, provide, hope, for, their, survival, the, first, european, tasmanian, settlers, ate, tasmanian, devil, which, they, described, as, tasting, like, veal, as, it, was, believed, devils, would, hunt, and, kill, livestock, possibly, due, to, strong, imagery, of, packs, of, devils, eating, weak, sheep, a, bounty, scheme, to, remove, the, devil, from, rural, properties, was, introduced, as, early, as, 1830, however, guiler, s, research, contended, that, the, real, cause, of, livestock, losses, was, poor, land, management, policies, and, feral, dogs, in, areas, where, the, devil, is, now, absent, poultry, has, continued, to, be, killed, by, quolls, in, earlier, times, hunting, possums, and, wallabies, for, fur, was, a, big, business, more, than, 900, 000, animals, were, hunted, in, 1923, and, this, resulted, in, a, continuation, of, bounty, hunting, of, devils, as, they, were, thought, to, be, a, major, threat, to, the, fur, industry, even, though, quolls, were, more, adept, at, hunting, the, animals, in, question, over, the, next, 100, years, trapping, and, poisoning, brought, them, to, the, brink, of, extinction, after, the, death, of, the, last, thylacine, in, 1936, the, tasmanian, devil, was, protected, by, law, in, june, 1941, and, the, population, slowly, recovered, in, the, 1950s, with, reports, of, increasing, numbers, some, permits, to, capture, devils, were, granted, after, complaints, of, livestock, damage, in, 1966, poisoning, permits, were, issued, although, attempts, to, have, the, animal, unprotected, failed, during, this, time, environmentalists, also, became, more, outspoken, particularly, as, scientific, studies, provided, new, data, suggesting, the, threat, of, devils, to, livestock, had, been, vastly, exaggerated, numbers, may, have, peaked, in, the, early, 1970s, after, a, population, boom, in, 1975, they, were, reported, to, be, lower, possibly, due, to, overpopulation, and, consequent, lack, of, food, another, report, of, overpopulation, and, livestock, damage, was, reported, in, 1987, the, following, year, trichinella, spiralis, a, parasite, which, kills, animals, and, can, infect, humans, was, found, in, devils, and, minor, panic, broke, out, before, scientists, assured, the, public, that, 30, of, devils, had, it, but, that, they, could, not, transmit, it, to, other, species, control, permits, were, ended, in, the, 1990s, but, illegal, killing, continues, to, a, limited, extent, albeit, locally, intense, this, is, not, considered, a, substantial, problem, for, the, survival, of, the, devil, approximately, 10, 000, devils, were, killed, per, year, in, the, mid, 1990s, a, selective, culling, program, has, taken, place, to, remove, individuals, affected, with, dftd, and, has, been, shown, to, not, slow, the, rate, of, disease, progression, or, reduced, the, number, of, animals, dying, a, model, has, been, tested, to, find, out, whether, culling, devils, infected, with, dftd, would, assist, in, the, survival, of, the, species, and, it, has, found, that, culling, would, not, be, a, suitable, strategy, to, employ, motor, vehicles, are, a, threat, to, localised, populations, of, non, abundant, tasmanian, mammals, and, a, 2010, study, showed, that, devils, were, particularly, vulnerable, a, study, of, nine, species, mostly, marsupials, of, a, similar, size, showed, that, devils, were, more, difficult, for, drivers, to, detect, and, avoid, at, high, beam, devils, had, the, lowest, detection, distance, 40, closer, than, the, median, this, requires, a, 20, reduction, in, speed, for, a, motorist, to, avoid, the, devil, for, low, beam, the, devils, had, the, second, shortest, detection, distance, 16, below, the, median, for, avoidance, of, roadkill, to, be, feasible, motorists, would, have, to, drive, at, around, half, the, current, speed, limit, in, rural, areas, a, study, in, the, 1990s, on, a, localised, population, of, devils, in, a, national, park, in, tasmania, recorded, a, halving, of, the, population, after, a, hitherto, gravel, access, road, was, upgraded, surfaced, with, bitumen, and, widened, at, the, same, time, there, was, a, large, increase, in, deaths, caused, by, vehicles, along, the, new, road, there, had, been, none, in, the, preceding, six, months, the, vast, majority, of, deaths, occurred, in, the, sealed, portion, of, the, road, believed, to, be, due, to, an, increase, in, speeds, it, was, also, conjectured, that, the, animals, were, harder, to, see, against, the, dark, bitumen, instead, of, the, light, gravel, the, devil, and, quoll, are, especially, vulnerable, as, they, often, try, to, retrieve, roadkill, for, food, and, travel, along, the, road, to, alleviate, the, problem, traffic, slowing, measures, man, made, pathways, that, offer, alternative, routes, for, devils, education, campaigns, and, the, installation, of, light, reflectors, to, indicate, oncoming, vehicles, have, been, implemented, they, are, credited, with, decreases, in, roadkill, devils, have, often, been, victims, of, roadkill, when, they, are, retrieving, other, roadkill, work, by, scientist, menna, jones, and, a, group, of, conservation, volunteers, to, remove, dead, animals, from, the, road, resulted, in, a, significant, reduction, in, devil, traffic, deaths, it, was, estimated, that, 3, 392, devils, or, 3, 8, 5, 7, of, the, population, were, being, killed, annually, by, vehicles, in, 2001, 2004, in, 2009, the, save, the, tasmanian, devil, group, launched, the, roadkill, project, which, allowed, members, of, the, public, to, report, sightings, of, devils, which, had, been, killed, on, the, road, on, 25, september, 2015, 20, immunised, devils, were, microchipped, and, released, in, narawntapu, national, park, by, 5, october, four, had, been, hit, by, cars, prompting, samantha, fox, leader, of, save, the, tasmanian, devil, to, describe, roadkill, as, being, the, biggest, threat, to, the, tasmanian, devil, after, dftd, a, series, of, solar, powered, alarms, have, been, trialled, that, make, noises, and, flash, lights, when, cars, are, approaching, warning, the, animals, the, trial, ran, for, 18, months, and, the, trial, area, had, two, thirds, less, deaths, than, the, control, first, seen, in, 1996, in, mount, william, in, northeastern, tasmania, devil, facial, tumour, disease, dftd, has, ravaged, tasmania, s, wild, devils, and, estimates, of, the, impact, range, from, 20, to, as, much, as, an, 80, decline, in, the, devil, population, with, over, 65, of, the, state, affected, the, state, s, west, coast, area, and, far, north, west, are, the, only, places, where, devils, are, tumour, free, individual, devils, die, within, months, of, infection, the, disease, is, an, example, of, transmissible, cancer, which, means, that, it, is, contagious, and, passed, from, one, animal, to, another, this, tumour, is, able, to, pass, between, hosts, without, inducing, a, response, from, the, host, s, immune, system, dominant, devils, who, engage, in, more, biting, behaviour, are, more, exposed, to, the, disease, wild, tasmanian, devil, populations, are, being, monitored, to, track, the, spread, of, the, disease, and, to, identify, changes, in, disease, prevalence, field, monitoring, involves, trapping, devils, within, a, defined, area, to, check, for, the, presence, of, the, disease, and, determine, the, number, of, affected, animals, the, same, area, is, visited, repeatedly, to, characterise, the, spread, of, the, disease, over, time, so, far, it, has, been, established, that, the, short, term, effects, of, the, disease, in, an, area, can, be, severe, long, term, monitoring, at, replicated, sites, will, be, essential, to, assess, whether, these, effects, remain, or, whether, populations, can, recover, field, workers, are, also, testing, the, effectiveness, of, disease, suppression, by, trapping, and, removing, diseased, devils, it, is, hoped, that, the, removal, of, diseased, devils, from, wild, populations, should, decrease, disease, prevalence, and, allow, more, devils, to, survive, beyond, their, juvenile, years, and, breed, in, march, 2017, scientists, at, the, university, of, tasmania, presented, an, apparent, first, report, of, having, successfully, treated, tasmanian, devils, with, the, disease, by, injecting, live, cancer, cells, into, the, infected, devils, to, stimulate, their, immune, system, to, recognise, and, fight, the, disease, in, 2020, it, was, reported, that, one, of, the, last, dftd, free, wild, population, of, tasmanian, devils, was, suffering, from, inbreeding, depression, and, has, undergone, a, significant, decline, in, reproductive, success, in, recent, years, at, lake, nitchie, in, western, new, south, wales, in, 1970, a, male, human, skeleton, wearing, a, necklace, of, 178, teeth, from, 49, different, devils, was, found, the, skeleton, is, estimated, to, be, 7000, years, old, and, the, necklace, is, believed, to, be, much, older, than, the, skeleton, archaeologist, josephine, flood, believes, the, devil, was, hunted, for, its, teeth, and, that, this, contributed, to, its, extinction, on, mainland, australia, owen, and, pemberton, note, that, few, such, necklaces, have, been, found, middens, that, contain, devil, bones, are, rare, two, notable, examples, are, devil, s, lair, in, the, south, western, part, of, western, australia, and, tower, hill, in, victoria, in, tasmania, local, indigenous, australians, and, devils, sheltered, in, the, same, caves, tasmanian, aboriginal, names, for, the, devil, recorded, by, europeans, include, tarrabah, poirinnah, and, par, loo, mer, rer, variations, also, exist, such, as, taraba, and, purinina, it, is, a, common, belief, that, devils, will, eat, humans, while, they, are, known, to, eat, dead, bodies, there, are, prevalent, myths, that, they, eat, living, humans, who, wander, into, the, bush, despite, outdated, beliefs, and, exaggerations, regarding, their, disposition, many, although, not, all, devils, will, remain, still, when, in, the, presence, of, a, human, some, will, also, shake, nervously, they, can, bite, and, scratch, out, of, fear, when, held, by, a, human, but, a, firm, grip, will, cause, them, to, remain, still, although, they, can, be, tamed, they, are, asocial, and, are, not, considered, appropriate, as, pets, they, have, an, unpleasant, odour, and, neither, demonstrate, nor, respond, to, affection, until, recently, the, devil, was, not, studied, much, by, academics, and, naturalists, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, hobart, zoo, operator, mary, roberts, who, was, not, a, trained, scientist, was, credited, for, changing, people, s, attitudes, and, encouraging, scientific, interest, in, native, animals, such, as, the, devil, that, were, seen, as, fearsome, and, abhorrent, and, the, human, perception, of, the, animal, changed, theodore, thomson, flynn, was, the, first, professor, of, biology, in, tasmania, and, carried, out, some, research, during, the, period, around, world, war, i, in, the, mid, 1960s, professor, guiler, assembled, a, team, of, researchers, and, started, a, decade, of, systematic, fieldwork, on, the, devil, this, is, seen, as, the, start, of, modern, scientific, study, of, it, however, the, devil, was, still, negatively, depicted, including, in, tourism, material, the, first, doctorate, awarded, for, research, into, the, devil, came, in, 1991, early, attempts, to, breed, tasmanian, devils, in, captivity, had, limited, success, mary, roberts, bred, a, pair, at, beaumaris, zoo, which, she, named, billy, and, truganini, in, 1913, however, although, advised, to, remove, billy, roberts, found, truganini, too, distressed, by, his, absence, and, returned, him, the, first, litter, was, presumed, eaten, by, billy, but, a, second, litter, in, 1914, survived, after, billy, was, removed, roberts, wrote, an, article, on, keeping, and, breeding, the, devils, for, the, london, zoological, society, even, by, 1934, successful, breeding, of, the, devil, was, rare, in, a, study, on, the, growth, of, young, devils, in, captivity, some, developmental, stages, were, very, different, from, those, reported, by, guiler, the, pinnae, were, free, on, day, 36, and, eyes, opened, later, on, days, 115, 121, in, general, females, tend, to, retain, more, stress, after, being, taken, into, captivity, than, males, tasmanian, devils, were, displayed, in, various, zoos, around, the, world, from, the, 1850s, onwards, in, the, 1950s, several, animals, were, given, to, european, zoos, in, october, 2005, the, tasmanian, government, sent, four, devils, two, male, and, two, female, to, the, copenhagen, zoo, following, the, birth, of, the, first, son, of, king, frederik, x, of, denmark, and, his, tasmanian, born, wife, mary, due, to, restrictions, on, their, export, by, the, australian, government, at, the, time, these, were, the, only, devils, known, to, be, living, outside, australia, in, june, 2013, due, to, the, successes, of, the, insurance, population, program, it, was, planned, to, send, devils, to, other, zoos, around, the, world, in, a, pilot, program, san, diego, zoo, wildlife, alliance, and, albuquerque, biopark, were, selected, to, participate, in, the, program, and, wellington, zoo, and, auckland, zoo, soon, followed, in, the, united, states, four, additional, zoos, have, since, been, selected, as, part, of, the, australian, government, s, save, the, tasmanian, devil, program, the, zoos, selected, were, the, fort, wayne, children, s, zoo, the, los, angeles, zoo, the, saint, louis, zoo, and, the, toledo, zoo, captive, devils, are, usually, forced, to, stay, awake, during, the, day, to, cater, to, visitors, rather, than, following, their, natural, nocturnal, style, the, devil, is, an, iconic, animal, within, australia, and, particularly, associated, with, tasmania, the, animal, is, used, as, the, emblem, of, the, tasmanian, national, parks, and, wildlife, service, and, the, former, tasmanian, australian, rules, football, team, which, played, in, the, victorian, football, league, was, known, as, the, devils, the, hobart, devils, were, once, part, of, the, national, basketball, league, the, devil, has, appeared, on, several, commemorative, coins, in, australia, over, the, years, cascade, brewery, in, tasmania, sells, a, ginger, beer, with, a, tasmanian, devil, on, the, label, in, 2015, the, tasmanian, devil, was, chosen, as, tasmania, s, state, emblem, tasmanian, devils, are, popular, with, tourists, and, the, director, of, the, tasmanian, devil, conservation, park, has, described, their, possible, extinction, as, a, really, significant, blow, for, australian, and, tasmanian, tourism, there, has, also, been, a, multimillion, dollar, proposal, to, build, a, giant, 19, m, high, 35, m, long, devil, in, launceston, in, northern, tasmania, as, a, tourist, attraction, devils, began, to, be, used, as, ecotourism, in, the, 1970s, when, studies, showed, that, the, animals, were, often, the, only, things, known, about, tasmania, overseas, and, suggested, that, they, should, therefore, be, the, centrepiece, of, marketing, efforts, resulting, in, some, devils, being, taken, on, promotional, tours, the, tasmanian, devil, is, probably, best, known, internationally, as, the, inspiration, for, the, looney, tunes, cartoon, character, the, tasmanian, devil, or, taz, in, 1954, little, known, at, the, time, the, loud, hyperactive, cartoon, character, has, little, in, common, with, the, real, life, animal, after, a, few, shorts, between, 1957, and, 1964, the, character, was, retired, until, the, 1990s, when, he, gained, his, own, show, taz, mania, and, again, became, popular, in, 1997, a, newspaper, report, noted, that, warner, bros, had, trademarked, the, character, and, registered, the, name, tasmanian, devil, and, that, this, trademark, was, policed, including, an, eight, year, legal, case, to, allow, a, tasmanian, company, to, call, a, fishing, lure, tasmanian, devil, debate, followed, and, a, delegation, from, the, tasmanian, government, met, with, warner, bros, ray, groom, the, tourism, minister, later, announced, that, a, verbal, agreement, had, been, reached, an, annual, fee, would, be, paid, to, warner, bros, in, return, for, the, government, of, tasmania, being, able, to, use, the, image, of, taz, for, marketing, purposes, this, agreement, later, disappeared, in, 2006, warner, bros, permitted, the, government, of, tasmania, to, sell, stuffed, toys, of, taz, with, profits, funnelled, into, research, on, dftd
