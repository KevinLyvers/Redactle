canidae, k, n, d, i, from, latin, canis, dog, is, a, biological, family, of, dog, like, carnivorans, colloquially, referred, to, as, dogs, and, constitutes, a, clade, a, member, of, this, family, is, also, called, a, canid, k, e, n, d, the, family, includes, three, subfamilies, the, caninae, and, the, extinct, borophaginae, and, hesperocyoninae, the, caninae, are, known, as, canines, and, include, domestic, dogs, wolves, coyotes, foxes, jackals, and, other, species, canids, are, found, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, having, arrived, independently, or, accompanied, by, human, beings, over, extended, periods, of, time, canids, vary, in, size, from, the, 2, metre, long, 6, 6, ft, gray, wolf, to, the, 24, centimetre, long, 9, 4, in, fennec, fox, the, body, forms, of, canids, are, similar, typically, having, long, muzzles, upright, ears, teeth, adapted, for, cracking, bones, and, slicing, flesh, long, legs, and, bushy, tails, they, are, mostly, social, animals, living, together, in, family, units, or, small, groups, and, behaving, co, operatively, typically, only, the, dominant, pair, in, a, group, breeds, and, a, litter, of, young, are, reared, annually, in, an, underground, den, canids, communicate, by, scent, signals, and, vocalizations, one, canid, the, domestic, dog, originated, from, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, upper, paleolithic, humans, and, today, remains, one, of, the, most, widely, kept, domestic, animals, in, the, history, of, the, carnivores, the, family, canidae, is, represented, by, the, two, extinct, subfamilies, designated, as, hesperocyoninae, and, borophaginae, and, the, extant, subfamily, caninae, this, subfamily, includes, all, living, canids, and, their, most, recent, fossil, relatives, all, living, canids, as, a, group, form, a, dental, monophyletic, relationship, with, the, extinct, borophagines, with, both, groups, having, a, bicuspid, two, points, on, the, lower, carnassial, talonid, which, gives, this, tooth, an, additional, ability, in, mastication, this, together, with, the, development, of, a, distinct, entoconid, cusp, and, the, broadening, of, the, talonid, of, the, first, lower, molar, and, the, corresponding, enlargement, of, the, talon, of, the, upper, first, molar, and, reduction, of, its, parastyle, distinguish, these, late, cenozoic, canids, and, are, the, essential, differences, that, identify, their, clade, p6, the, cat, like, feliformia, and, dog, like, caniforms, emerged, within, the, carnivoramorpha, around, 45, 42, mya, million, years, ago, the, canidae, first, appeared, in, north, america, during, the, late, eocene, 37, 8, 33, 9, mya, they, did, not, reach, eurasia, until, the, late, miocene, or, to, south, america, until, the, late, pliocene, 7, this, cladogram, shows, the, phylogenetic, position, of, canids, within, caniformia, based, on, fossil, finds, bears, procyonids, pinnipeds, etc, various, miacis, spp, mesocyons, enhydrocyon, hesperocyons, other, basal, canines, e, g, cynodictis, aelurodons, cynarctins, others, all, modern, canids, and, extinct, relatives, the, canidae, today, includes, a, diverse, group, of, some, 37, species, ranging, in, size, from, the, maned, wolf, with, its, long, limbs, to, the, short, legged, bush, dog, modern, canids, inhabit, forests, tundra, savannahs, and, deserts, throughout, tropical, and, temperate, parts, of, the, world, the, evolutionary, relationships, between, the, species, have, been, studied, in, the, past, using, morphological, approaches, but, more, recently, molecular, studies, have, enabled, the, investigation, of, phylogenetics, relationships, in, some, species, genetic, divergence, has, been, suppressed, by, the, high, level, of, gene, flow, between, different, populations, and, where, the, species, have, hybridized, large, hybrid, zones, exist, carnivorans, evolved, after, the, extinction, of, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, 66, million, years, ago, around, 50, million, years, ago, or, earlier, in, the, paleocene, the, carnivorans, split, into, two, main, divisions, caniforms, dog, like, and, feliforms, cat, like, by, 40, mya, the, first, identifiable, member, of, the, dog, family, had, arisen, named, prohesperocyon, wilsoni, its, fossilized, remains, have, been, found, in, what, is, now, the, southwestern, part, of, texas, the, chief, features, which, identify, it, as, a, canid, include, the, loss, of, the, upper, third, molar, part, of, a, trend, toward, a, more, shearing, bite, and, the, structure, of, the, middle, ear, which, has, an, enlarged, bulla, the, hollow, bony, structure, protecting, the, delicate, parts, of, the, ear, prohesperocyon, probably, had, slightly, longer, limbs, than, its, predecessors, and, also, had, parallel, and, closely, touching, toes, which, differ, markedly, from, the, splayed, arrangements, of, the, digits, in, bears, the, canid, family, soon, subdivided, into, three, subfamilies, each, of, which, diverged, during, the, eocene, hesperocyoninae, about, 39, 74, 15, mya, borophaginae, about, 34, 32, mya, and, caninae, about, 34, 30, mya, the, caninae, are, the, only, surviving, subfamily, and, all, present, day, canids, including, wolves, foxes, coyotes, jackals, and, domestic, dogs, members, of, each, subfamily, showed, an, increase, in, body, mass, with, time, and, some, exhibited, specialized, hypercarnivorous, diets, that, made, them, prone, to, extinction, fig, 1, by, the, oligocene, all, three, subfamilies, of, canids, hesperocyoninae, borophaginae, and, caninae, had, appeared, in, the, fossil, records, of, north, america, the, earliest, and, most, primitive, branch, of, the, canidae, was, the, hesperocyoninae, lineage, which, included, the, coyote, sized, mesocyon, of, the, oligocene, 38, 24, mya, these, early, canids, probably, evolved, for, the, fast, pursuit, of, prey, in, a, grassland, habitat, they, resembled, modern, viverrids, in, appearance, hesperocyonines, eventually, became, extinct, in, the, middle, miocene, one, of, the, early, members, of, the, hesperocyonines, the, genus, hesperocyon, gave, rise, to, archaeocyon, and, leptocyon, these, branches, led, to, the, borophagine, and, canine, radiations, around, 8, mya, the, beringian, land, bridge, allowed, members, of, the, genus, eucyon, a, means, to, enter, asia, from, north, america, and, they, continued, on, to, colonize, europe, the, canis, urocyon, and, vulpes, genera, developed, from, canids, from, north, america, where, the, canine, radiation, began, the, success, of, these, canines, was, related, to, the, development, of, lower, carnassials, that, were, capable, of, both, mastication, and, shearing, around, 5, million, years, ago, some, of, the, old, world, eucyon, evolved, into, the, first, members, of, canis, during, the, pliocene, around, 4, 5, mya, canis, lepophagus, appeared, in, north, america, this, was, small, and, sometimes, coyote, like, others, were, wolf, like, in, characteristics, c, latrans, the, coyote, is, theorized, to, have, descended, from, c, lepophagus, the, formation, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, about, 3, mya, joined, south, america, to, north, america, allowing, canids, to, invade, south, america, where, they, diversified, however, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, the, south, american, canids, lived, in, north, america, some, 4, mya, and, more, than, one, incursion, across, the, new, land, bridge, is, likely, given, the, fact, that, more, than, one, lineage, is, present, in, south, america, two, north, american, lineages, found, in, south, america, are, the, gray, fox, urocyon, cinereoargentus, and, the, now, extinct, dire, wolf, aenocyon, dirus, besides, these, there, are, species, endemic, to, south, america, the, maned, wolf, chrysocyon, brachyurus, the, short, eared, dog, atelocynus, microtis, the, bush, dog, speothos, venaticus, the, crab, eating, fox, cerdocyon, thous, and, the, south, american, foxes, lycalopex, spp, the, monophyly, of, this, group, has, been, established, by, molecular, means, during, the, pleistocene, the, north, american, wolf, line, appeared, with, canis, edwardii, clearly, identifiable, as, a, wolf, and, canis, rufus, appeared, possibly, a, direct, descendant, of, c, edwardii, around, 0, 8, mya, canis, ambrusteri, emerged, in, north, america, a, large, wolf, it, was, found, all, over, north, and, central, america, and, was, eventually, supplanted, by, the, dire, wolf, which, then, spread, into, south, america, during, the, late, pleistocene, by, 0, 3, mya, a, number, of, subspecies, of, the, gray, wolf, c, lupus, had, developed, and, had, spread, throughout, europe, and, northern, asia, the, gray, wolf, colonized, north, america, during, the, late, rancholabrean, era, across, the, bering, land, bridge, with, at, least, three, separate, invasions, with, each, one, consisting, of, one, or, more, different, eurasian, gray, wolf, clades, mtdna, studies, have, shown, that, there, are, at, least, four, extant, c, lupus, lineages, the, dire, wolf, shared, its, habitat, with, the, gray, wolf, but, became, extinct, in, a, large, scale, extinction, event, that, occurred, around, 11, 500, years, ago, it, may, have, been, more, of, a, scavenger, than, a, hunter, its, molars, appear, to, be, adapted, for, crushing, bones, and, it, may, have, gone, extinct, as, a, result, of, the, extinction, of, the, large, herbivorous, animals, on, whose, carcasses, it, relied, in, 2015, a, study, of, mitochondrial, genome, sequences, and, whole, genome, nuclear, sequences, of, african, and, eurasian, canids, indicated, that, extant, wolf, like, canids, have, colonized, africa, from, eurasia, at, least, five, times, throughout, the, pliocene, and, pleistocene, which, is, consistent, with, fossil, evidence, suggesting, that, much, of, african, canid, fauna, diversity, resulted, from, the, immigration, of, eurasian, ancestors, likely, coincident, with, plio, pleistocene, climatic, oscillations, between, arid, and, humid, conditions, when, comparing, the, african, and, eurasian, golden, jackals, the, study, concluded, that, the, african, specimens, represented, a, distinct, monophyletic, lineage, that, should, be, recognized, as, a, separate, species, canis, anthus, african, golden, wolf, according, to, a, phylogeny, derived, from, nuclear, sequences, the, eurasian, golden, jackal, canis, aureus, diverged, from, the, wolf, coyote, lineage, 1, 9, mya, but, the, african, golden, wolf, separated, 1, 3, mya, mitochondrial, genome, sequences, indicated, the, ethiopian, wolf, diverged, from, the, wolf, coyote, lineage, slightly, prior, to, that, s1, wild, canids, are, found, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, and, inhabit, a, wide, range, of, different, habitats, including, deserts, mountains, forests, and, grasslands, they, vary, in, size, from, the, fennec, fox, which, may, be, as, little, as, 24, cm, 9, 4, in, in, length, and, weigh, 0, 6, kg, 1, 3, lb, to, the, gray, wolf, which, may, be, up, to, 160, cm, 5, 2, ft, long, and, can, weigh, up, to, 79, kg, 174, lb, only, a, few, species, are, arboreal, the, gray, fox, the, closely, related, island, fox, and, the, raccoon, dog, habitually, climb, trees, all, canids, have, a, similar, basic, form, as, exemplified, by, the, gray, wolf, although, the, relative, length, of, muzzle, limbs, ears, and, tail, vary, considerably, between, species, with, the, exceptions, of, the, bush, dog, the, raccoon, dog, and, some, domestic, dog, breeds, canids, have, relatively, long, legs, and, lithe, bodies, adapted, for, chasing, prey, the, tails, are, bushy, and, the, length, and, quality, of, the, pelage, vary, with, the, season, the, muzzle, portion, of, the, skull, is, much, more, elongated, than, that, of, the, cat, family, the, zygomatic, arches, are, wide, there, is, a, transverse, lambdoidal, ridge, at, the, rear, of, the, cranium, and, in, some, species, a, sagittal, crest, running, from, front, to, back, the, bony, orbits, around, the, eye, never, form, a, complete, ring, and, the, auditory, bullae, are, smooth, and, rounded, females, have, three, to, seven, pairs, of, mammae, all, canids, are, digitigrade, meaning, they, walk, on, their, toes, the, tip, of, the, nose, is, always, naked, as, are, the, cushioned, pads, on, the, soles, of, the, feet, these, latter, consist, of, a, single, pad, behind, the, tip, of, each, toe, and, a, more, or, less, three, lobed, central, pad, under, the, roots, of, the, digits, hairs, grow, between, the, pads, and, in, the, arctic, fox, the, sole, of, the, foot, is, densely, covered, with, hair, at, some, times, of, the, year, with, the, exception, of, the, four, toed, african, wild, dog, lycaon, pictus, five, toes, are, on, the, forefeet, but, the, pollex, thumb, is, reduced, and, does, not, reach, the, ground, on, the, hind, feet, are, four, toes, but, in, some, domestic, dogs, a, fifth, vestigial, toe, known, as, a, dewclaw, is, sometimes, present, but, has, no, anatomical, connection, to, the, rest, of, the, foot, in, some, species, slightly, curved, nails, are, non, retractile, and, more, or, less, blunt, while, other, species, have, sharper, partially, retractile, claws, the, canine, penis, contains, a, baculum, and, a, structure, called, the, bulbus, glandis, that, expands, during, copulation, forming, a, copulatory, tie, that, lasts, for, up, to, an, hour, young, canids, are, born, blind, with, their, eyes, opening, a, few, weeks, after, birth, all, living, canids, caninae, have, a, ligament, analogous, to, the, nuchal, ligament, of, ungulates, used, to, maintain, the, posture, of, the, head, and, neck, with, little, active, muscle, exertion, this, ligament, allows, them, to, conserve, energy, while, running, long, distances, following, scent, trails, with, their, nose, to, the, ground, however, based, on, skeletal, details, of, the, neck, at, least, some, of, the, borophaginae, such, as, aelurodon, are, believed, to, have, lacked, this, ligament, dentition, relates, to, the, arrangement, of, teeth, in, the, mouth, with, the, dental, notation, for, the, upper, jaw, teeth, using, the, upper, case, letters, i, to, denote, incisors, c, for, canines, p, for, premolars, and, m, for, molars, and, the, lower, case, letters, i, c, p, and, m, to, denote, the, mandible, teeth, teeth, are, numbered, using, one, side, of, the, mouth, and, from, the, front, of, the, mouth, to, the, back, in, carnivores, the, upper, premolar, p4, and, the, lower, molar, m1, form, the, carnassials, that, are, used, together, in, a, scissor, like, action, to, shear, the, muscle, and, tendon, of, prey, canids, use, their, premolars, for, cutting, and, crushing, except, for, the, upper, fourth, premolar, p4, the, upper, carnassial, that, is, only, used, for, cutting, they, use, their, molars, for, grinding, except, for, the, lower, first, molar, m1, the, lower, carnassial, that, has, evolved, for, both, cutting, and, grinding, depending, on, the, canid, s, dietary, adaptation, on, the, lower, carnassial, the, trigonid, is, used, for, slicing, and, the, talonid, is, used, for, grinding, the, ratio, between, the, trigonid, and, the, talonid, indicates, a, carnivore, s, dietary, habits, with, a, larger, trigonid, indicating, a, hypercarnivore, and, a, larger, talonid, indicating, a, more, omnivorous, diet, because, of, its, low, variability, the, length, of, the, lower, carnassial, is, used, to, provide, an, estimate, of, a, carnivore, s, body, size, a, study, of, the, estimated, bite, force, at, the, canine, teeth, of, a, large, sample, of, living, and, fossil, mammalian, predators, when, adjusted, for, their, body, mass, found, that, for, placental, mammals, the, bite, force, at, the, canines, was, greatest, in, the, extinct, dire, wolf, 163, followed, among, the, modern, canids, by, the, four, hypercarnivores, that, often, prey, on, animals, larger, than, themselves, the, african, wild, dog, 142, the, gray, wolf, 136, the, dhole, 112, and, the, dingo, 108, the, bite, force, at, the, carnassials, showed, a, similar, trend, to, the, canines, a, predator, s, largest, prey, size, is, strongly, influenced, by, its, biomechanical, limits, most, canids, have, 42, teeth, with, a, dental, formula, of, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, the, bush, dog, has, only, one, upper, molar, with, two, below, the, dhole, has, two, above, and, two, below, and, the, bat, eared, fox, has, three, or, four, upper, molars, and, four, lower, ones, the, molar, teeth, are, strong, in, most, species, allowing, the, animals, to, crack, open, bone, to, reach, the, marrow, the, deciduous, or, baby, teeth, formula, in, canids, is, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, molars, being, completely, absent, almost, all, canids, are, social, animals, and, live, together, in, groups, in, general, they, are, territorial, or, have, a, home, range, and, sleep, in, the, open, using, their, dens, only, for, breeding, and, sometimes, in, bad, weather, in, most, foxes, and, in, many, of, the, true, dogs, a, male, and, female, pair, work, together, to, hunt, and, to, raise, their, young, gray, wolves, and, some, of, the, other, larger, canids, live, in, larger, groups, called, packs, african, wild, dogs, have, packs, which, may, consist, of, 20, to, 40, animals, and, packs, of, fewer, than, about, seven, individuals, may, be, incapable, of, successful, reproduction, hunting, in, packs, has, the, advantage, that, larger, prey, items, can, be, tackled, some, species, form, packs, or, live, in, small, family, groups, depending, on, the, circumstances, including, the, type, of, available, food, in, most, species, some, individuals, live, on, their, own, within, a, canid, pack, there, is, a, system, of, dominance, so, that, the, strongest, most, experienced, animals, lead, the, pack, in, most, cases, the, dominant, male, and, female, are, the, only, pack, members, to, breed, canids, communicate, with, each, other, by, scent, signals, by, visual, clues, and, gestures, and, by, vocalizations, such, as, growls, barks, and, howls, in, most, cases, groups, have, a, home, territory, from, which, they, drive, out, other, conspecifics, canids, use, urine, scent, marks, to, mark, their, food, caches, or, warn, trespassing, individuals, social, behavior, is, also, mediated, by, secretions, from, glands, on, the, upper, surface, of, the, tail, near, its, root, and, from, the, anal, glands, preputial, glands, and, supracaudal, glands, canids, as, a, group, exhibit, several, reproductive, traits, that, are, uncommon, among, mammals, as, a, whole, they, are, typically, monogamous, provide, paternal, care, to, their, offspring, have, reproductive, cycles, with, lengthy, proestral, and, dioestral, phases, and, have, a, copulatory, tie, during, mating, they, also, retain, adult, offspring, in, the, social, group, suppressing, the, ability, of, these, to, breed, while, making, use, of, the, alloparental, care, they, can, provide, to, help, raise, the, next, generation, of, offspring, most, canid, species, are, spontaneous, ovulators, although, maned, wolves, are, induced, ovulators, during, the, proestral, period, increased, levels, of, estradiol, make, the, female, attractive, to, the, male, there, is, a, rise, in, progesterone, during, the, estral, phase, when, female, is, receptive, following, this, the, level, of, estradiol, fluctuates, and, there, is, a, lengthy, dioestrous, phase, during, which, the, female, is, pregnant, pseudo, pregnancy, frequently, occurs, in, canids, that, have, ovulated, but, failed, to, conceive, a, period, of, anestrus, follows, pregnancy, or, pseudo, pregnancy, there, being, only, one, oestral, period, during, each, breeding, season, small, and, medium, sized, canids, mostly, have, a, gestation, period, of, 50, to, 60, days, while, larger, species, average, 60, to, 65, days, the, time, of, year, in, which, the, breeding, season, occurs, is, related, to, the, length, of, day, as, has, been, demonstrated, in, the, case, of, several, species, that, have, been, translocated, across, the, equator, to, the, other, hemisphere, and, experiences, a, six, month, shift, of, phase, domestic, dogs, and, certain, small, canids, in, captivity, may, come, into, oestrus, more, frequently, perhaps, because, the, photoperiod, stimulus, breaks, down, under, conditions, of, artificial, lighting, canids, have, an, oestrus, period, of, 1, to, 20, days, lasting, one, week, in, most, species, the, size, of, a, litter, varies, with, from, one, to, 16, or, more, pups, being, born, the, young, are, born, small, blind, and, helpless, and, require, a, long, period, of, parental, care, they, are, kept, in, a, den, most, often, dug, into, the, ground, for, warmth, and, protection, when, the, young, begin, eating, solid, food, both, parents, and, often, other, pack, members, bring, food, back, for, them, from, the, hunt, this, is, most, often, vomited, up, from, the, adult, s, stomach, where, such, pack, involvement, in, the, feeding, of, the, litter, occurs, the, breeding, success, rate, is, higher, than, is, the, case, where, females, split, from, the, group, and, rear, their, pups, in, isolation, young, canids, may, take, a, year, to, mature, and, learn, the, skills, they, need, to, survive, in, some, species, such, as, the, african, wild, dog, male, offspring, usually, remain, in, the, natal, pack, while, females, disperse, as, a, group, and, join, another, small, group, of, the, opposite, sex, to, form, a, new, pack, one, canid, the, domestic, dog, entered, into, a, partnership, with, humans, a, long, time, ago, the, dog, was, the, first, domesticated, species, the, archaeological, record, shows, the, first, undisputed, dog, remains, buried, beside, humans, 14, 700, years, ago, with, disputed, remains, occurring, 36, 000, years, ago, these, dates, imply, that, the, earliest, dogs, arose, in, the, time, of, human, hunter, gatherers, and, not, agriculturists, the, fact, that, wolves, are, pack, animals, with, cooperative, social, structures, may, have, been, the, reason, that, the, relationship, developed, humans, benefited, from, the, canid, s, loyalty, cooperation, teamwork, alertness, and, tracking, abilities, while, the, wolf, may, have, benefited, from, the, use, of, weapons, to, tackle, larger, prey, and, the, sharing, of, food, humans, and, dogs, may, have, evolved, together, among, canids, only, the, gray, wolf, has, widely, been, known, to, prey, on, humans, nonetheless, at, least, two, records, of, coyotes, killing, humans, have, been, published, and, at, least, two, other, reports, of, golden, jackals, killing, children, human, beings, have, trapped, and, hunted, some, canid, species, for, their, fur, and, some, especially, the, gray, wolf, the, coyote, and, the, red, fox, for, sport, canids, such, as, the, dhole, are, now, endangered, in, the, wild, because, of, persecution, habitat, loss, a, depletion, of, ungulate, prey, species, and, transmission, of, diseases, from, domestic, dogs
