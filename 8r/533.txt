the, great, white, shark, carcharodon, carcharias, also, known, as, the, white, shark, white, pointer, or, simply, great, white, is, a, species, of, large, mackerel, shark, which, can, be, found, in, the, coastal, surface, waters, of, all, the, major, oceans, it, is, the, only, known, surviving, species, of, its, genus, carcharodon, the, great, white, shark, is, notable, for, its, size, with, the, largest, preserved, female, specimen, measuring, 5, 83, m, 19, 1, ft, in, length, and, around, 2, 000, kg, 4, 400, lb, in, weight, at, maturity, however, most, are, smaller, males, measure, 3, 4, to, 4, 0, m, 11, to, 13, ft, and, females, measure, 4, 6, to, 4, 9, m, 15, to, 16, ft, on, average, according, to, a, 2014, study, the, lifespan, of, great, white, sharks, is, estimated, to, be, as, long, as, 70, years, or, more, well, above, previous, estimates, making, it, one, of, the, longest, lived, cartilaginous, fishes, currently, known, according, to, the, same, study, male, great, white, sharks, take, 26, years, to, reach, sexual, maturity, while, the, females, take, 33, years, to, be, ready, to, produce, offspring, great, white, sharks, can, swim, at, speeds, of, 25, km, h, 16, mph, for, short, bursts, and, to, depths, of, 1, 200, m, 3, 900, ft, the, great, white, shark, is, arguably, the, world, s, largest, known, extant, macropredatory, fish, and, is, one, of, the, primary, predators, of, marine, mammals, such, as, pinnipeds, and, dolphins, the, great, white, shark, is, also, known, to, prey, upon, a, variety, of, other, animals, including, fish, other, sharks, and, seabirds, it, has, only, one, recorded, natural, predator, the, orca, the, species, faces, numerous, ecological, challenges, which, has, resulted, in, international, protection, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, lists, the, great, white, shark, as, a, vulnerable, species, and, it, is, included, in, appendix, ii, of, cites, it, is, also, protected, by, several, national, governments, such, as, australia, as, of, 2018, due, to, their, need, to, travel, long, distances, for, seasonal, migration, and, extremely, demanding, diet, it, is, not, logistically, feasible, to, keep, great, white, sharks, in, captivity, because, of, this, while, attempts, have, been, made, to, do, so, in, the, past, there, are, no, known, aquariums, in, the, world, believed, to, house, a, live, specimen, the, great, white, shark, is, depicted, in, popular, culture, as, a, ferocious, man, eater, largely, as, a, result, of, the, novel, jaws, by, peter, benchley, and, its, subsequent, film, adaptation, by, steven, spielberg, humans, are, not, a, preferred, prey, but, nevertheless, it, is, responsible, for, the, largest, number, of, reported, and, identified, fatal, unprovoked, shark, attacks, on, humans, however, attacks, are, rare, typically, occurring, fewer, than, 10, times, per, year, globally, the, great, white, is, the, sole, recognized, extant, species, in, the, genus, carcharodon, and, is, one, of, five, extant, species, belonging, to, the, family, lamnidae, other, members, of, this, family, include, the, mako, sharks, porbeagle, and, salmon, shark, the, family, belongs, to, the, lamniformes, the, order, of, mackerel, sharks, the, english, name, white, shark, and, its, australian, variant, white, pointer, is, thought, to, have, come, from, the, shark, s, stark, white, underside, a, characteristic, feature, most, noticeable, in, beached, sharks, lying, upside, down, with, their, bellies, exposed, colloquial, use, favours, the, name, great, white, shark, with, great, perhaps, stressing, the, size, and, prowess, of, the, species, and, white, shark, having, historically, been, used, to, describe, the, much, smaller, oceanic, white, tipped, shark, later, referred, to, for, a, time, as, the, lesser, white, shark, most, scientists, prefer, white, shark, as, the, name, lesser, white, shark, is, no, longer, used, while, some, use, white, shark, to, refer, to, all, members, of, the, lamnidae, the, scientific, genus, name, carcharodon, literally, means, jagged, tooth, a, reference, to, the, large, serrations, that, appear, in, the, shark, s, teeth, it, is, a, portmanteau, of, two, ancient, greek, words, the, prefix, carchar, is, derived, from, k, rkharos, which, means, jagged, or, sharp, the, suffix, odon, is, a, romanization, of, od, n, a, which, translates, to, tooth, the, specific, name, carcharias, is, a, latinization, of, karkhar, as, the, ancient, greek, word, for, shark, the, great, white, shark, was, one, of, the, species, originally, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, 1758, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, in, which, it, was, identified, as, an, amphibian, and, assigned, the, scientific, name, squalus, carcharias, squalus, being, the, genus, that, he, placed, all, sharks, in, by, the, 1810s, it, was, recognized, that, the, shark, should, be, placed, in, a, new, genus, but, it, was, not, until, 1838, when, sir, andrew, smith, coined, the, name, carcharodon, as, the, new, genus, there, have, been, a, few, attempts, to, describe, and, classify, the, great, white, before, linnaeus, one, of, its, earliest, mentions, in, literature, as, a, distinct, type, of, animal, appears, in, pierre, belon, s, 1553, book, de, aquatilibus, duo, cum, eiconibus, ad, vivam, ipsorum, effigiem, quoad, ejus, fieri, potuit, ad, amplissimum, cardinalem, castilioneum, in, it, he, illustrated, and, described, the, shark, under, the, name, canis, carcharias, based, on, the, jagged, nature, of, its, teeth, and, its, alleged, similarities, with, dogs, another, name, used, for, the, great, white, around, this, time, was, lamia, first, coined, by, guillaume, rondelet, in, his, 1554, book, libri, de, piscibus, marinis, who, also, identified, it, as, the, fish, that, swallowed, the, prophet, jonah, in, biblical, texts, linnaeus, recognized, both, names, as, previous, classifications, carcharias, taurus, cetorhinus, maximus, lamna, nasus, lamna, ditropis, carcharodon, carcharias, isurus, oxyrinchus, isurus, paucus, molecular, clock, studies, published, between, 1988, and, 2002, determined, the, closest, living, relative, of, the, great, white, to, be, the, mako, sharks, of, the, genus, isurus, which, diverged, some, time, between, 60, and, 43, million, years, ago, tracing, this, evolutionary, relationship, through, fossil, evidence, however, remains, subject, to, further, paleontological, study, the, original, hypothesis, of, the, great, white, shark, s, origin, held, that, it, is, a, descendant, of, a, lineage, of, mega, toothed, sharks, and, is, closely, related, to, the, prehistoric, megalodon, these, sharks, were, considerably, larger, in, size, with, megalodon, attaining, an, estimated, length, of, up, to, 14, 2, 20, 3, m, 47, 67, ft, similarities, between, the, teeth, of, great, white, and, mega, toothed, sharks, such, as, large, triangular, shapes, serrated, blades, and, the, presence, of, dental, bands, led, the, primary, evidence, of, a, close, evolutionary, relationship, as, a, result, scientists, classified, the, ancient, forms, under, the, genus, carcharodon, although, weaknesses, in, the, hypothesis, existed, such, as, uncertainty, over, exactly, which, species, evolved, into, the, modern, great, white, and, multiple, gaps, in, the, fossil, record, palaeontologists, were, able, to, chart, the, hypothetical, lineage, back, to, a, 60, million, year, old, shark, known, as, cretalamna, as, the, common, ancestor, of, all, sharks, within, the, lamnidae, however, it, is, now, understood, that, the, great, white, shark, holds, closer, ties, to, the, mako, sharks, and, is, descended, from, a, separate, lineage, as, a, chronospecies, unrelated, to, the, mega, toothed, sharks, this, was, proven, with, the, discovery, of, a, transitional, species, that, connected, the, great, white, to, an, unserrated, shark, known, as, carcharodon, hastalis, this, transitional, species, which, was, named, carcharodon, hubbelli, in, 2012, demonstrated, a, mosaic, of, evolutionary, transitions, between, the, great, white, and, c, hastalis, namely, the, gradual, appearance, of, serrations, in, a, span, of, between, 8, and, 5, million, years, ago, the, progression, of, c, hubbelli, characterized, shifting, diets, and, niches, by, 6, 5, million, years, ago, the, serrations, were, developed, enough, for, c, hubbelli, to, handle, marine, mammals, although, both, the, great, white, and, c, hastalis, were, known, worldwide, c, hubbelli, is, primarily, found, in, california, peru, chile, and, surrounding, coastal, deposits, indicating, that, the, great, white, had, pacific, origins, c, hastalis, continued, to, thrive, alongside, the, great, white, until, its, last, appearance, around, one, million, years, ago, and, is, believed, to, have, possibly, sired, a, number, of, additional, species, including, carcharodon, subserratus, and, carcharodon, plicatilis, however, yun, argued, that, the, tooth, fossil, remains, of, c, hastalis, and, great, white, shark, have, been, documented, from, the, same, deposits, hence, the, former, cannot, be, a, chronospecific, ancestor, of, the, latter, he, also, criticized, that, the, c, hastalis, morphotype, has, never, been, tested, through, phylogenetic, analyses, and, denoted, that, as, of, 2021, the, argument, that, the, modern, carcharodon, lineage, with, narrow, serrated, teeth, evolved, from, c, hastalis, with, a, broad, unserrated, teeth, is, uncertain, tracing, beyond, c, hastalis, another, prevailing, hypothesis, proposes, that, the, great, white, and, mako, lineages, shared, a, common, ancestor, in, a, primitive, mako, like, species, the, identity, of, this, ancestor, is, still, debated, but, a, potential, species, includes, isurolamna, inflata, which, lived, between, 65, and, 55, million, years, ago, it, is, hypothesized, that, the, great, white, and, mako, lineages, split, with, the, rise, of, two, separate, descendants, the, one, representing, the, great, white, shark, lineage, being, macrorhizodus, praecursor, great, white, sharks, live, in, almost, all, coastal, and, offshore, waters, which, have, water, temperature, between, 12, and, 24, c, 54, and, 75, f, with, greater, concentrations, in, the, united, states, northeast, and, california, south, africa, japan, oceania, chile, and, the, mediterranean, including, the, sea, of, marmara, and, bosphorus, one, of, the, densest, known, populations, is, found, around, dyer, island, south, africa, juvenile, great, white, sharks, inhabit, a, more, narrow, band, of, temperatures, between, 14, and, 24, c, 57, and, 75, f, in, shallow, coastal, nurseries, increased, observation, of, young, sharks, in, areas, they, were, not, previously, common, such, as, monterey, bay, on, the, central, california, coast, suggest, climate, change, may, be, reducing, the, range, of, juvenile, great, white, sharks, and, shifting, it, toward, the, poles, the, great, white, is, an, epipelagic, fish, observed, mostly, in, the, presence, of, rich, game, such, as, fur, seals, arctocephalus, ssp, sea, lions, cetaceans, other, sharks, and, large, bony, fish, species, in, the, open, ocean, it, has, been, recorded, at, depths, as, great, as, 1, 200, m, 3, 900, ft, these, findings, challenge, the, traditional, notion, that, the, great, white, is, a, coastal, species, according, to, a, recent, study, california, great, whites, have, migrated, to, an, area, between, baja, california, peninsula, and, hawaii, known, as, the, white, shark, caf, to, spend, at, least, 100, days, before, migrating, back, to, baja, on, the, journey, out, they, swim, slowly, and, dive, down, to, around, 900, m, 3, 000, ft, after, they, arrive, they, change, behaviour, and, do, short, dives, to, about, 300, m, 980, ft, for, up, to, ten, minutes, another, white, shark, that, was, tagged, off, the, south, african, coast, swam, to, the, southern, coast, of, australia, and, back, within, the, year, a, similar, study, tracked, a, different, great, white, shark, from, south, africa, swimming, to, australia, s, northwestern, coast, and, back, a, journey, of, 20, 000, km, 12, 000, mi, 11, 000, nmi, in, under, nine, months, these, observations, argue, against, traditional, theories, that, white, sharks, are, coastal, territorial, predators, and, open, up, the, possibility, of, interaction, between, shark, populations, that, were, previously, thought, to, have, been, discrete, the, reasons, for, their, migration, and, what, they, do, at, their, destination, is, still, unknown, possibilities, include, seasonal, feeding, or, mating, in, the, northwest, atlantic, the, white, shark, populations, off, the, new, england, coast, were, nearly, eradicated, due, to, over, fishing, in, recent, years, the, populations, have, grown, greatly, largely, due, to, the, increase, in, seal, populations, on, cape, cod, massachusetts, since, the, enactment, of, the, marine, mammal, protection, act, in, 1972, currently, very, little, is, known, about, the, hunting, and, movement, patterns, of, great, whites, off, cape, cod, but, ongoing, studies, hope, to, offer, insight, into, this, growing, shark, population, the, massachusetts, division, of, marine, fisheries, part, of, the, department, of, fish, and, game, began, a, population, study, in, 2014, since, 2019, this, research, has, focused, on, how, humans, can, avoid, conflict, with, sharks, scientists, believe, all, north, atlantic, great, white, sharks, spend, their, first, year, of, life, near, new, york, city, off, the, coast, of, long, island, a, 2018, study, indicated, that, white, sharks, prefer, to, congregate, deep, in, anticyclonic, eddies, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, the, sharks, studied, tended, to, favour, the, warm, water, eddies, spending, the, daytime, hours, at, depths, of, 450, m, 1, 480, ft, and, coming, to, the, surface, at, night, the, great, white, shark, has, a, robust, large, conical, snout, the, upper, and, lower, lobes, on, the, tail, fin, are, approximately, the, same, size, which, is, similar, to, some, mackerel, sharks, a, great, white, displays, countershading, by, having, a, white, underside, and, a, grey, dorsal, area, sometimes, in, a, brown, or, blue, shade, that, gives, an, overall, mottled, appearance, the, coloration, makes, it, difficult, for, prey, to, spot, the, shark, because, it, breaks, up, the, shark, s, outline, when, seen, from, the, side, from, above, the, darker, shade, blends, with, the, sea, and, from, below, it, exposes, a, minimal, silhouette, against, the, sunlight, leucism, is, extremely, rare, in, this, species, but, has, been, documented, at, least, three, times, in, a, pup, that, washed, ashore, in, australia, and, died, in, another, pup, in, south, africa, and, a, third, six, metre, adult, male, in, indonesia, great, white, sharks, like, many, other, sharks, have, rows, of, serrated, teeth, behind, the, main, ones, ready, to, replace, any, that, break, off, when, the, shark, bites, it, shakes, its, head, side, to, side, helping, the, teeth, saw, off, large, chunks, of, flesh, great, white, sharks, like, other, mackerel, sharks, have, larger, eyes, than, other, shark, species, in, proportion, to, their, body, size, the, iris, of, the, eye, is, a, deep, blue, instead, of, black, in, great, white, sharks, sexual, dimorphism, is, present, and, females, are, generally, larger, than, males, male, great, whites, on, average, measure, 3, 4, to, 4, 0, m, 11, to, 13, ft, in, length, while, females, measure, 4, 6, to, 4, 9, m, 15, to, 16, ft, adults, of, this, species, weigh, 522, 771, kg, 1, 151, 1, 700, lb, on, average, however, mature, females, can, have, an, average, mass, of, 680, 1, 110, kg, 1, 500, 2, 450, lb, the, largest, females, have, been, verified, up, to, 6, 1, m, 20, ft, in, length, and, an, estimated, 1, 905, kg, 4, 200, lb, in, weight, perhaps, up, to, 2, 268, kg, 5, 000, lb, the, maximum, size, is, subject, to, debate, because, some, reports, are, rough, estimations, or, speculations, performed, under, questionable, circumstances, among, living, cartilaginous, fish, only, the, whale, shark, rhincodon, typus, the, basking, shark, cetorhinus, maximus, and, the, giant, manta, ray, manta, birostris, in, that, order, are, on, average, larger, and, heavier, these, three, species, are, generally, quite, docile, in, disposition, and, given, to, passively, filter, feeding, on, very, small, organisms, this, makes, the, great, white, shark, the, largest, extant, macropredatory, fish, great, white, sharks, measure, approximately, 1, 2, m, 3, 9, ft, when, born, and, grow, about, 25, cm, 9, 8, in, every, year, a, complete, female, great, white, shark, specimen, in, the, museum, of, zoology, in, lausanne, and, claimed, by, de, maddalena, et, al, 2003, as, the, largest, preserved, specimen, measured, 5, 83, m, 19, 1, ft, in, total, body, length, with, the, caudal, fin, in, its, depressed, position, and, is, estimated, to, have, weighed, 2, 000, kg, 4, 410, lb, according, to, j, e, randall, the, largest, white, shark, reliably, measured, was, a, 5, 94, m, 19, 5, ft, specimen, reported, from, ledge, point, western, australia, in, 1987, but, it, is, unclear, whether, that, length, was, measured, with, the, caudal, fin, in, its, depressed, or, natural, position, another, great, white, specimen, of, similar, size, was, a, female, caught, in, august, 1988, in, the, gulf, of, st, lawrence, off, prince, edward, island, by, david, mckendrick, of, alberton, prince, edward, island, this, female, great, white, was, 6, 1, m, 20, ft, long, as, verified, by, the, canadian, shark, research, center, a, report, of, a, specimen, reportedly, measuring, 6, 4, m, 21, ft, in, length, and, with, a, body, mass, estimated, at, 3, 175, 3, 324, kg, 7, 000, 7, 328, lb, caught, in, 1945, off, the, coast, of, cuba, was, at, the, time, considered, reliable, by, some, experts, however, later, studies, revealed, this, particular, specimen, to, be, around, 4, 9, m, 16, ft, in, length, i, e, a, specimen, within, the, typical, maximum, size, range, the, largest, great, white, recognized, by, the, international, game, fish, association, igfa, is, one, caught, by, alf, dean, in, southern, australian, waters, in, 1959, weighing, 1, 208, kg, 2, 663, lb, a, number, of, very, large, unconfirmed, great, white, shark, specimens, have, been, recorded, for, decades, many, ichthyological, works, as, well, as, the, guinness, book, of, world, records, listed, two, great, white, sharks, as, the, largest, individuals, in, the, 1870s, a, 10, 9, m, 36, ft, great, white, captured, in, southern, australian, waters, near, port, fairy, and, an, 11, 3, m, 37, ft, shark, trapped, in, a, herring, weir, in, new, brunswick, canada, in, the, 1930s, however, these, measurements, were, not, obtained, in, a, rigorous, scientifically, valid, manner, and, researchers, have, questioned, the, reliability, of, these, measurements, for, a, long, time, noting, they, were, much, larger, than, any, other, accurately, reported, sighting, later, studies, proved, these, doubts, to, be, well, founded, this, new, brunswick, shark, may, have, been, a, misidentified, basking, shark, as, the, two, have, similar, body, shapes, the, question, of, the, port, fairy, shark, was, settled, in, the, 1970s, when, j, e, randall, examined, the, shark, s, jaws, and, found, that, the, port, fairy, shark, was, of, the, order, of, 5, m, 16, ft, in, length, and, suggested, that, a, mistake, had, been, made, in, the, original, record, in, 1870, of, the, shark, s, length, while, these, measurements, have, not, been, confirmed, some, great, white, sharks, caught, in, modern, times, have, been, estimated, to, be, more, than, 7, m, 23, ft, long, but, these, claims, have, received, some, criticism, however, j, e, randall, believed, that, great, white, shark, may, have, exceeded, 6, 1, m, 20, ft, in, length, a, great, white, shark, was, captured, near, kangaroo, island, in, australia, on, 1, april, 1987, this, shark, was, estimated, to, be, more, than, 6, 9, m, 23, ft, long, by, peter, resiley, and, has, been, designated, as, kanga, another, great, white, shark, was, caught, in, malta, by, alfredo, cutajar, on, 16, april, 1987, this, shark, was, also, estimated, to, be, around, 7, 13, m, 23, 4, ft, long, by, john, abela, and, has, been, designated, as, malta, however, cappo, drew, criticism, because, he, used, shark, size, estimation, methods, proposed, by, j, e, randall, to, suggest, that, the, kanga, specimen, was, 5, 8, 6, 4, m, 19, 21, ft, long, in, a, similar, fashion, i, k, fergusson, also, used, shark, size, estimation, methods, proposed, by, j, e, randall, to, suggest, that, the, malta, specimen, was, 5, 3, 5, 7, m, 17, 19, ft, long, however, photographic, evidence, suggested, that, these, specimens, were, larger, than, the, size, estimations, yielded, through, randall, s, methods, thus, a, team, of, scientists, h, f, mollet, g, m, cailliet, a, p, klimley, d, a, ebert, a, d, testi, and, l, j, v, compagno, reviewed, the, cases, of, the, kanga, and, malta, specimens, in, 1996, to, resolve, the, dispute, by, conducting, a, comprehensive, morphometric, analysis, of, the, remains, of, these, sharks, and, re, examination, of, photographic, evidence, in, an, attempt, to, validate, the, original, size, estimations, and, their, findings, were, consistent, with, them, the, findings, indicated, that, estimations, by, p, resiley, and, j, abela, are, reasonable, and, could, not, be, ruled, out, a, particularly, large, female, great, white, nicknamed, deep, blue, estimated, measuring, at, 6, 1, m, 20, ft, was, filmed, off, guadalupe, during, shooting, for, the, 2014, episode, of, shark, week, jaws, strikes, back, deep, blue, would, also, later, gain, significant, attention, when, she, was, filmed, interacting, with, researcher, mauricio, hoyas, pallida, in, a, viral, video, that, mauricio, posted, on, facebook, on, 11, june, 2015, deep, blue, was, later, seen, off, oahu, in, january, 2019, while, scavenging, a, sperm, whale, carcass, whereupon, she, was, filmed, swimming, beside, divers, including, dive, tourism, operator, and, model, ocean, ramsey, in, open, water, a, particularly, infamous, great, white, shark, supposedly, of, record, proportions, once, patrolled, the, area, that, comprises, false, bay, south, africa, was, said, to, be, well, over, 7, m, 23, ft, during, the, early, 1980s, this, shark, known, locally, as, the, submarine, had, a, legendary, reputation, that, was, supposedly, well, founded, though, rumours, have, stated, this, shark, was, exaggerated, in, size, or, non, existent, altogether, witness, accounts, by, the, then, young, craig, anthony, ferreira, a, notable, shark, expert, in, south, africa, and, his, father, indicate, an, unusually, large, animal, of, considerable, size, and, power, though, it, remains, uncertain, just, how, massive, the, shark, was, as, it, escaped, capture, each, time, it, was, hooked, ferreira, describes, the, four, encounters, with, the, giant, shark, he, participated, in, with, great, detail, in, his, book, great, white, sharks, on, their, best, behavior, one, contender, in, maximum, size, among, the, predatory, sharks, is, the, tiger, shark, galeocerdo, cuvier, while, tiger, sharks, which, are, typically, both, a, few, feet, smaller, and, have, a, leaner, less, heavy, body, structure, than, white, sharks, have, been, confirmed, to, reach, at, least, 5, 5, m, 18, ft, in, the, length, an, unverified, specimen, was, reported, to, have, measured, 7, 4, m, 24, ft, in, length, and, weighed, 3, 110, kg, 6, 860, lb, more, than, two, times, heavier, than, the, largest, confirmed, specimen, at, 1, 524, kg, 3, 360, lb, some, other, macropredatory, sharks, such, as, the, greenland, shark, somniosus, microcephalus, and, the, pacific, sleeper, shark, s, pacificus, are, also, reported, to, rival, these, sharks, in, length, but, probably, weigh, a, bit, less, since, they, are, more, slender, in, build, than, a, great, white, in, exceptional, cases, great, white, sharks, like, all, other, sharks, have, an, extra, sense, given, by, the, ampullae, of, lorenzini, which, enables, them, to, detect, the, electromagnetic, field, emitted, by, the, movement, of, living, animals, great, whites, are, so, sensitive, they, can, detect, variations, of, half, a, billionth, of, a, volt, at, close, range, this, allows, the, shark, to, locate, even, immobile, animals, by, detecting, their, heartbeat, most, fish, have, a, less, developed, but, similar, sense, using, their, body, s, lateral, line, to, more, successfully, hunt, fast, and, agile, prey, such, as, sea, lions, the, great, white, has, adapted, to, maintain, a, body, temperature, warmer, than, the, surrounding, water, one, of, these, adaptations, is, a, rete, mirabile, latin, for, wonderful, net, this, close, web, like, structure, of, veins, and, arteries, located, along, each, lateral, side, of, the, shark, conserves, heat, by, warming, the, cooler, arterial, blood, with, the, venous, blood, that, has, been, warmed, by, the, working, muscles, this, keeps, certain, parts, of, the, body, particularly, the, stomach, at, temperatures, up, to, 14, c, 25, f, above, that, of, the, surrounding, water, while, the, heart, and, gills, remain, at, sea, temperature, when, conserving, energy, the, core, body, temperature, can, drop, to, match, the, surroundings, a, great, white, shark, s, success, in, raising, its, core, temperature, is, an, example, of, gigantothermy, therefore, the, great, white, shark, can, be, considered, an, endothermic, poikilotherm, or, mesotherm, because, its, body, temperature, is, not, constant, but, is, internally, regulated, great, whites, also, rely, on, the, fat, and, oils, stored, within, their, livers, for, long, distance, migrations, across, nutrient, poor, areas, of, the, oceans, studies, by, stanford, university, and, the, monterey, bay, aquarium, published, on, 17, july, 2013, revealed, that, in, addition, to, controlling, the, sharks, buoyancy, the, liver, of, great, whites, is, essential, in, migration, patterns, sharks, that, sink, faster, during, drift, dives, were, revealed, to, use, up, their, internal, stores, of, energy, quicker, than, those, which, sink, in, a, dive, at, more, leisurely, rates, toxicity, from, heavy, metals, seems, to, have, little, negative, effects, on, great, white, sharks, blood, samples, taken, from, forty, three, individuals, of, varying, size, age, and, sex, off, the, south, african, coast, led, by, biologists, from, the, university, of, miami, in, 2012, indicates, that, despite, high, levels, of, mercury, lead, and, arsenic, there, was, no, sign, of, raised, white, blood, cell, count, and, granulate, to, lymphocyte, ratios, indicating, the, sharks, had, healthy, immune, systems, this, discovery, suggests, a, previously, unknown, physiological, defence, against, heavy, metal, poisoning, great, whites, are, known, to, have, a, propensity, for, self, healing, and, avoiding, age, related, ailments, a, 2007, study, from, the, university, of, new, south, wales, in, sydney, australia, used, ct, scans, of, a, shark, s, skull, and, computer, models, to, measure, the, shark, s, maximum, bite, force, the, study, reveals, the, forces, and, behaviours, its, skull, is, adapted, to, handle, and, resolves, competing, theories, about, its, feeding, behaviour, in, 2008, a, team, of, scientists, led, by, stephen, wroe, conducted, an, experiment, to, determine, the, great, white, shark, s, jaw, power, and, findings, indicated, that, a, specimen, massing, 3, 324, kg, 7, 328, lb, could, exert, a, bite, force, of, 18, 216, newtons, 4, 095, lbf, this, shark, s, behaviour, and, social, structure, are, complex, in, south, africa, white, sharks, have, a, dominance, hierarchy, where, an, individual, s, rank, is, primarily, established, by, their, size, and, to, a, lesser, extent, their, sex, and, squatter, s, rights, larger, sharks, dominate, smaller, sharks, females, dominate, males, and, established, residents, dominate, newcomers, when, hunting, great, whites, tend, to, separate, and, resolve, conflicts, with, rituals, and, displays, white, sharks, rarely, resort, to, combat, although, some, individuals, have, been, found, with, bite, marks, that, match, those, of, other, white, sharks, this, suggests, that, when, a, great, white, approaches, too, closely, to, another, they, react, with, a, warning, bite, another, possibility, is, that, white, sharks, bite, to, show, their, dominance, data, acquired, from, animal, borne, telemetry, receivers, and, published, in, 2022, via, the, journal, royal, society, publishing, suggests, that, individual, great, whites, may, associate, so, that, they, can, inadvertently, share, information, on, the, whereabouts, of, prey, or, the, location, of, the, remains, of, animals, that, can, be, scavenged, as, biologging, can, help, to, reveal, social, habits, it, allows, a, better, understanding, to, be, made, in, future, studies, regarding, the, full, extent, of, social, interactions, in, large, marine, animals, including, the, great, white, shark, the, great, white, shark, is, one, of, only, a, few, sharks, known, to, regularly, lift, its, head, above, the, sea, surface, to, gaze, at, other, objects, such, as, prey, this, is, known, as, spy, hopping, this, behaviour, has, also, been, seen, in, at, least, one, group, of, blacktip, reef, sharks, but, this, might, be, learned, from, interaction, with, humans, it, is, theorized, that, the, shark, may, also, be, able, to, smell, better, this, way, because, smell, travels, through, air, faster, than, through, water, white, sharks, are, generally, very, curious, animals, display, intelligence, and, may, also, turn, to, socializing, if, the, situation, demands, it, at, seal, island, white, sharks, have, been, observed, arriving, and, departing, in, stable, clans, of, two, to, six, individuals, on, a, yearly, basis, whether, clan, members, are, related, is, unknown, but, they, get, along, peacefully, enough, in, fact, the, social, structure, of, a, clan, is, probably, most, aptly, compared, to, that, of, a, wolf, pack, in, that, each, member, has, a, clearly, established, rank, and, each, clan, has, an, alpha, leader, when, members, of, different, clans, meet, they, establish, social, rank, nonviolently, through, any, of, a, variety, of, interactions, in, 2022, research, in, south, africa, suggested, that, the, great, white, shark, has, the, ability, to, change, colours, to, camouflage, itself, depending, on, the, hormones, it, gives, off, different, hormones, would, change, the, colour, of, the, skin, from, white, to, grey, skin, dosed, with, adrenaline, would, turn, lighter, with, melanocyte, stimulating, hormone, causing, melanocyte, cells, to, dissipate, thus, making, the, shark, s, skin, a, darker, colour, although, hormone, mediated, color, change, is, not, fully, validated, due, to, the, limited, number, of, test, subjects, i, e, great, whites, the, camo, shark, hypothesis, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, zebra, sharks, can, change, their, colour, as, they, age, and, rainbow, sharks, can,

of, whale, blubber, could, feed, a, 4, 5, m, 15, ft, white, shark, for, 1, 5, months, detailed, observations, were, made, of, four, whale, carcasses, in, false, bay, between, 2000, and, 2010, sharks, were, drawn, to, the, carcass, by, chemical, and, odour, detection, spread, by, strong, winds, after, initially, feeding, on, the, whale, caudal, peduncle, and, fluke, the, sharks, would, investigate, the, carcass, by, slowly, swimming, around, it, and, mouthing, several, parts, before, selecting, a, blubber, rich, area, during, feeding, bouts, of, 15, 20, seconds, the, sharks, removed, flesh, with, lateral, headshakes, without, the, protective, ocular, rotation, they, employ, when, attacking, live, prey, the, sharks, were, frequently, observed, regurgitating, chunks, of, blubber, and, immediately, returning, to, feed, possibly, in, order, to, replace, low, energy, yield, pieces, with, high, energy, yield, pieces, using, their, teeth, as, mechanoreceptors, to, distinguish, them, after, feeding, for, several, hours, the, sharks, appeared, to, become, lethargic, no, longer, swimming, to, the, surface, they, were, observed, mouthing, the, carcass, but, apparently, unable, to, bite, hard, enough, to, remove, flesh, they, would, instead, bounce, off, and, slowly, sink, up, to, eight, sharks, were, observed, feeding, simultaneously, bumping, into, each, other, without, showing, any, signs, of, aggression, on, one, occasion, a, shark, accidentally, bit, the, head, of, a, neighbouring, shark, leaving, two, teeth, embedded, but, both, continued, to, feed, unperturbed, smaller, individuals, hovered, around, the, carcass, eating, chunks, that, drifted, away, unusually, for, the, area, large, numbers, of, sharks, over, five, metres, long, were, observed, suggesting, that, the, largest, sharks, change, their, behaviour, to, search, for, whales, as, they, lose, the, manoeuvrability, required, to, hunt, seals, the, investigating, team, concluded, that, the, importance, of, whale, carcasses, particularly, for, the, largest, white, sharks, has, been, underestimated, in, another, documented, incident, white, sharks, were, observed, scavenging, on, a, whale, carcass, alongside, tiger, sharks, in, 2020, marine, biologists, sasha, dines, and, enrico, gennari, published, a, documented, incident, in, the, journal, marine, and, freshwater, research, of, a, group, of, great, white, sharks, exhibiting, pack, like, behaviour, successfully, attacking, and, killing, a, live, juvenile, 7, m, 23, ft, humpback, whale, the, sharks, utilized, the, classic, attack, strategy, used, on, pinnipeds, when, attacking, the, whale, even, utilizing, the, bite, and, spit, tactic, they, employ, on, smaller, prey, items, the, whale, was, an, entangled, individual, heavily, emaciated, and, thus, more, vulnerable, to, the, sharks, attacks, the, incident, is, the, first, known, documentation, of, great, whites, actively, killing, a, large, baleen, whale, a, second, incident, regarding, great, white, sharks, killing, humpback, whales, involving, a, single, large, female, great, white, nicknamed, helen, was, documented, off, the, coast, of, south, africa, working, alone, the, shark, attacked, a, 33, ft, 10, m, emaciated, and, entangled, humpback, whale, by, attacking, the, whale, s, tail, to, cripple, it, before, she, managed, to, drown, the, whale, by, biting, onto, its, head, and, pulling, it, underwater, the, attack, was, witnessed, via, aerial, drone, by, marine, biologist, ryan, johnson, who, said, the, attack, went, on, for, roughly, 50, minutes, before, the, shark, successfully, killed, the, whale, johnson, suggested, that, the, shark, may, have, strategized, its, attack, in, order, to, kill, such, a, large, animal, stomach, contents, of, great, whites, also, indicates, that, whale, sharks, both, juvenile, and, adult, may, also, be, included, on, the, animal, s, menu, though, whether, this, is, active, hunting, or, scavenging, is, not, known, at, present, great, white, sharks, were, previously, thought, to, reach, sexual, maturity, at, around, 15, years, of, age, but, are, now, believed, to, take, far, longer, male, great, white, sharks, reach, sexual, maturity, at, age, 26, while, females, take, 33, years, to, reach, sexual, maturity, maximum, life, span, was, originally, believed, to, be, more, than, 30, years, but, a, study, by, the, woods, hole, oceanographic, institution, placed, it, at, upwards, of, 70, years, examinations, of, vertebral, growth, ring, count, gave, a, maximum, male, age, of, 73, years, and, a, maximum, female, age, of, 40, years, for, the, specimens, studied, the, shark, s, late, sexual, maturity, low, reproductive, rate, long, gestation, period, of, 11, months, and, slow, growth, make, it, vulnerable, to, pressures, such, as, overfishing, and, environmental, change, little, is, known, about, the, great, white, shark, s, mating, habits, and, mating, behaviour, had, not, been, observed, in, this, species, until, 1997, and, properly, documented, in, 2020, it, was, assumed, previously, to, be, possible, that, whale, carcasses, are, an, important, location, for, sexually, mature, sharks, to, meet, for, mating, according, to, the, testimony, of, fisherman, dick, ledgerwood, who, observed, two, great, white, sharks, mating, in, the, area, near, port, chalmers, and, otago, harbor, in, new, zealand, it, is, theorized, that, great, white, sharks, mate, in, shallow, water, away, from, feeding, areas, and, continually, roll, belly, to, belly, during, copulation, birth, has, never, been, observed, but, pregnant, females, have, been, examined, great, white, sharks, are, ovoviviparous, which, means, eggs, develop, and, hatch, in, the, uterus, and, continue, to, develop, until, birth, the, great, white, has, an, 11, month, gestation, period, the, shark, pup, s, powerful, jaws, begin, to, develop, in, the, first, month, the, unborn, sharks, participate, in, oophagy, in, which, they, feed, on, ova, produced, by, the, mother, delivery, is, in, spring, and, summer, the, largest, number, of, pups, recorded, for, this, species, is, 14, pups, from, a, single, mother, measuring, 4, 5, m, 15, ft, that, was, killed, incidentally, off, taiwan, in, 2019, on, 9, july, 2023, the, first, footage, of, what, was, likely, a, newborn, great, white, shark, was, filmed, via, aerial, drone, off, of, southern, california, off, carpinteria, after, a, large, adult, shark, was, seen, diving, to, the, bottom, roughly, 1, 000, ft, 300, m, from, the, shoreline, after, which, the, smaller, shark, rose, to, the, surface, the, young, shark, estimated, up, to, 1, 5, m, 4, 9, ft, long, was, pale, in, colour, possibly, due, to, what, may, be, an, embryonic, covering, possibly, intrauterine, milk, was, seen, sloughing, off, the, skin, of, the, young, shark, adult, sharks, filmed, in, the, area, days, prior, suggest, the, area, may, be, a, birthing, ground, for, pregnant, females, this, footage, was, published, in, the, journal, environmental, biology, of, fishes, on, 29, january, 2024, a, breach, is, the, result, of, a, high, speed, approach, to, the, surface, with, the, resulting, momentum, taking, the, shark, partially, or, completely, clear, of, the, water, this, is, a, hunting, technique, employed, by, great, white, sharks, whilst, hunting, seals, this, technique, is, often, used, on, cape, fur, seals, at, seal, island, in, false, bay, south, africa, because, the, behaviour, is, unpredictable, it, is, very, hard, to, document, it, was, first, photographed, by, chris, fallows, and, rob, lawrence, who, developed, the, technique, of, towing, a, slow, moving, seal, decoy, to, trick, the, sharks, to, breach, between, april, and, september, scientists, may, observe, around, 600, breaches, the, seals, swim, on, the, surface, and, the, great, white, sharks, launch, their, predatory, attack, from, the, deeper, water, below, they, can, reach, speeds, of, up, to, 40, km, h, 25, mph, and, can, at, times, launch, themselves, more, than, 3, m, 10, ft, into, the, air, just, under, half, of, observed, breach, attacks, are, successful, in, 2011, a, 3, m, long, shark, jumped, onto, a, seven, person, research, vessel, off, seal, island, in, mossel, bay, the, crew, were, undertaking, a, population, study, using, sardines, as, bait, and, the, incident, was, judged, not, to, be, an, attack, on, the, boat, but, an, accident, interspecific, competition, between, the, great, white, shark, and, the, orca, is, probable, in, regions, where, dietary, preferences, of, both, species, may, overlap, an, incident, was, documented, on, 4, october, 1997, in, the, farallon, islands, off, california, in, the, united, states, an, estimated, 4, 7, 5, 3, m, 15, 17, ft, female, orca, immobilized, an, estimated, 3, 4, m, 9, 8, 13, 1, ft, great, white, shark, the, orca, held, the, shark, upside, down, to, induce, tonic, immobility, and, kept, the, shark, still, for, fifteen, minutes, causing, it, to, suffocate, the, orca, then, proceeded, to, eat, the, dead, shark, s, liver, it, is, believed, that, the, scent, of, the, slain, shark, s, carcass, caused, all, the, great, whites, in, the, region, to, flee, forfeiting, an, opportunity, for, a, great, seasonal, feed, another, similar, attack, apparently, occurred, there, in, 2000, but, its, outcome, is, not, clear, after, both, attacks, the, local, population, of, about, 100, great, whites, vanished, following, the, 2000, incident, a, great, white, with, a, satellite, tag, was, found, to, have, immediately, submerged, to, a, depth, of, 500, m, 1, 600, ft, and, swam, to, hawaii, in, 2015, a, pod, of, orcas, was, recorded, to, have, killed, a, great, white, shark, off, south, australia, in, 2017, three, great, whites, were, found, washed, ashore, near, gansbaai, south, africa, with, their, body, cavities, torn, open, and, the, livers, removed, by, what, is, likely, to, have, been, orcas, orcas, also, generally, impact, great, white, distribution, studies, published, in, 2019, of, orca, and, great, white, shark, distribution, and, interactions, around, the, farallon, islands, indicate, that, the, cetaceans, impact, the, sharks, negatively, with, brief, appearances, by, orcas, causing, the, sharks, to, seek, out, new, feeding, areas, until, the, next, season, it, is, unclear, whether, this, is, an, example, of, competitive, exclusion, or, ecology, of, fear, occasionally, however, some, great, whites, have, been, seen, to, swim, near, orcas, without, fear, the, great, white, shark, is, the, definitive, host, of, two, species, of, tapeworms, from, the, genus, clistobothrium, these, being, clistobothrium, carcharodoni, and, clistobothrium, tumidum, both, of, which, infect, the, shark, s, spiral, intestine, the, former, is, believed, to, be, transmitted, to, great, whites, through, the, consumption, of, infected, cetacean, prey, namely, the, spinner, dolphin, stenella, longirostris, risso, s, dolphin, grampus, griseus, and, the, common, bottlenose, dolphin, tursiops, truncatus, all, of, which, serve, as, intermediary, or, paratenic, hosts, of, the, tapeworm, the, latter, species, of, tapeworm, s, transmission, vector, is, currently, unknown, but, it, is, unlikely, to, share, the, same, intermediary, hosts, as, clisbotherium, carcharodoni, the, intensity, of, clistobothrium, carcharodoni, infestations, in, affected, great, whites, is, extremely, high, in, one, case, up, to, 2, 533, specimens, were, recovered, from, the, spiral, valve, of, a, single, great, white, there, are, two, recorded, instances, of, the, ectoparasitic, cookiecutter, shark, isistius, brasiliensis, targeting, subadult, great, whites, off, the, coast, of, guadalupe, island, however, the, relative, dearth, of, predation, records, indicates, that, great, whites, are, not, a, common, food, source, for, cookiecutter, sharks, and, that, cetaceans, and, pinnipeds, especially, the, guadalupe, fur, seal, arctocephalus, townsendi, are, preferred, over, great, whites, in, part, due, to, the, higher, caloric, content, of, their, blubber, and, in, part, due, to, the, higher, risk, of, retaliation, from, victimized, great, whites, of, all, shark, species, the, great, white, shark, is, responsible, for, by, far, the, largest, number, of, recorded, shark, bite, incidents, on, humans, with, 351, documented, unprovoked, bite, incidents, on, humans, as, of, 2024, more, than, any, documented, bite, incident, peter, benchley, s, best, selling, novel, jaws, and, the, subsequent, 1975, film, adaptation, directed, by, steven, spielberg, provided, the, great, white, shark, with, the, image, of, being, a, man, eater, in, the, public, mind, while, great, white, sharks, have, killed, humans, in, at, least, 74, documented, unprovoked, bite, incidents, they, typically, do, not, target, them, for, example, in, the, mediterranean, sea, there, have, been, 31, confirmed, bite, incidents, against, humans, in, the, last, two, centuries, most, of, which, were, non, fatal, many, of, the, incidents, seemed, to, be, test, bites, great, white, sharks, also, test, bite, buoys, flotsam, and, other, unfamiliar, objects, and, they, might, grab, a, human, or, a, surfboard, to, identify, what, it, is, many, bite, incidents, occur, in, waters, with, low, visibility, or, other, situations, which, impair, the, shark, s, senses, the, species, appears, to, not, like, the, taste, of, humans, or, at, least, finds, the, taste, unfamiliar, further, research, shows, that, they, can, tell, in, one, bite, whether, or, not, the, object, is, worth, predating, upon, humans, for, the, most, part, are, too, bony, for, their, liking, they, much, prefer, seals, which, are, fat, and, rich, in, protein, studies, published, in, 2021, by, ryan, et, al, in, the, journal, of, the, royal, society, interface, suggest, that, mistaken, identity, is, in, fact, a, case, for, many, shark, bite, incidents, perpetrated, by, great, white, sharks, using, cameras, and, footage, of, seals, in, aquariums, as, models, and, mounted, cameras, moving, at, the, same, speed, and, angle, as, a, cruising, great, white, shark, looking, up, at, the, surface, from, below, the, experiment, suggests, that, the, sharks, are, likely, colorblind, and, cannot, see, in, fine, enough, detail, to, determine, whether, the, silhouette, above, them, is, a, pinniped, or, a, swimming, human, potentially, vindicating, the, hypothesis, humans, are, not, appropriate, prey, because, the, shark, s, digestion, is, too, slow, to, cope, with, a, human, s, high, ratio, of, bone, to, muscle, and, fat, accordingly, in, most, recorded, shark, bite, incidents, great, whites, broke, off, contact, after, the, first, bite, fatalities, are, usually, caused, by, blood, loss, from, the, initial, bite, rather, than, from, critical, organ, loss, or, from, whole, consumption, as, of, 2024, of, the, 351, recorded, unprovoked, attacks, 59, were, fatal, however, some, researchers, have, hypothesized, that, the, reason, the, proportion, of, fatalities, is, low, is, not, that, sharks, do, not, like, human, flesh, but, because, humans, are, often, able, to, escape, after, the, first, bite, in, the, 1980s, john, mccosker, chair, of, aquatic, biology, at, the, california, academy, of, sciences, noted, that, divers, who, dived, solo, and, were, bitten, by, great, whites, were, generally, at, least, partially, consumed, while, divers, who, followed, the, buddy, system, were, generally, rescued, by, their, companion, mccosker, and, timothy, c, tricas, an, author, and, professor, at, the, university, of, hawaii, suggest, that, a, standard, pattern, for, great, whites, is, to, make, an, initial, devastating, attack, and, then, wait, for, the, prey, to, weaken, before, consuming, the, wounded, animal, humans, ability, to, move, out, of, reach, with, the, help, of, others, thus, foiling, the, attack, is, unusual, for, a, great, white, s, prey, shark, culling, is, the, deliberate, killing, of, sharks, by, a, government, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, shark, attacks, shark, culling, is, often, called, shark, control, these, programs, have, been, criticized, by, environmentalists, and, scientists, they, say, these, programs, harm, the, marine, ecosystem, they, also, say, such, programs, are, outdated, cruel, and, ineffective, many, different, species, dolphins, turtles, etc, are, also, killed, in, these, programs, because, of, their, use, of, shark, nets, and, drum, lines, 15, 135, marine, animals, were, killed, in, new, south, wales, nets, between, 1950, and, 2008, and, 84, 000, marine, animals, were, killed, by, queensland, authorities, from, 1962, to, 2015, great, white, sharks, are, currently, killed, in, both, queensland, and, new, south, wales, in, shark, control, shark, culling, programs, queensland, uses, shark, nets, and, drum, lines, with, baited, hooks, while, new, south, wales, only, uses, nets, from, 1962, to, 2018, queensland, authorities, killed, about, 50, 000, sharks, many, of, which, were, great, whites, from, 2013, to, 2014, alone, 667, sharks, were, killed, by, queensland, authorities, including, great, white, sharks, in, queensland, great, white, sharks, found, alive, on, the, drum, lines, are, shot, in, new, south, wales, between, 1950, and, 2008, a, total, of, 577, great, white, sharks, were, killed, in, nets, between, september, 2017, and, april, 2018, fourteen, great, white, sharks, were, killed, in, new, south, wales, kwazulu, natal, an, area, of, south, africa, also, has, a, shark, control, program, that, kills, great, white, sharks, and, other, marine, life, in, a, 30, year, period, more, than, 33, 000, sharks, were, killed, in, kwazulu, natal, s, shark, killing, program, including, great, whites, in, 2014, the, state, government, of, western, australia, led, by, premier, colin, barnett, implemented, a, policy, of, killing, large, sharks, the, policy, colloquially, referred, to, as, the, western, australian, shark, cull, was, intended, to, protect, users, of, the, marine, environment, from, shark, bite, incidents, following, the, deaths, of, seven, people, on, the, western, australian, coastline, in, the, years, 2010, 2013, baited, drum, lines, were, deployed, near, popular, beaches, using, hooks, designed, to, catch, great, white, sharks, as, well, as, bull, and, tiger, sharks, large, sharks, found, hooked, but, still, alive, were, shot, and, their, bodies, discarded, at, sea, the, government, claimed, they, were, not, culling, the, sharks, but, were, using, a, targeted, localised, hazard, mitigation, strategy, barnett, described, opposition, as, ludicrous, and, extreme, and, said, that, nothing, could, change, his, mind, this, policy, was, met, with, widespread, condemnation, from, the, scientific, community, which, showed, that, species, responsible, for, bite, incidents, were, notoriously, hard, to, identify, that, the, drum, lines, failed, to, capture, white, sharks, as, intended, and, that, the, government, also, failed, to, show, any, correlation, between, their, drum, line, policy, and, a, decrease, in, shark, bite, incidents, in, the, region, great, white, sharks, infrequently, bite, and, sometimes, even, sink, boats, only, five, of, the, 108, authenticated, unprovoked, shark, bite, incidents, reported, from, the, pacific, coast, during, the, 20th, century, involved, kayakers, in, a, few, cases, they, have, bitten, boats, up, to, 10, m, 33, ft, in, length, they, have, bumped, or, knocked, people, overboard, usually, biting, the, boat, from, the, stern, in, one, case, in, 1936, a, large, shark, leapt, completely, into, the, south, african, fishing, boat, lucky, jim, knocking, a, crewman, into, the, sea, tricas, and, mccosker, s, underwater, observations, suggest, that, sharks, are, attracted, to, boats, by, the, electrical, fields, they, generate, which, are, picked, up, by, the, ampullae, of, lorenzini, and, confuse, the, shark, about, whether, or, not, wounded, prey, might, be, nearby, prior, to, august, 1981, no, great, white, shark, in, captivity, lived, longer, than, 11, days, in, august, 1981, a, great, white, survived, for, 16, days, at, seaworld, san, diego, before, being, released, the, idea, of, containing, a, live, great, white, at, seaworld, orlando, was, used, in, the, 1983, film, jaws, 3, d, monterey, bay, aquarium, first, attempted, to, display, a, great, white, in, 1984, but, the, shark, died, after, 11, days, because, it, did, not, eat, in, july, 2003, monterey, researchers, captured, a, small, female, and, kept, it, in, a, large, netted, pen, near, malibu, for, five, days, they, had, the, rare, success, of, getting, the, shark, to, feed, in, captivity, before, its, release, not, until, september, 2004, was, the, aquarium, able, to, place, a, great, white, on, long, term, exhibit, a, young, female, which, was, caught, off, the, coast, of, ventura, was, kept, in, the, aquarium, s, 3, 8, million, l, 1, million, us, gal, outer, bay, exhibit, for, 198, days, before, she, was, released, in, march, 2005, she, was, tracked, for, 30, days, after, release, on, the, evening, of, 31, august, 2006, the, aquarium, introduced, a, juvenile, male, caught, outside, santa, monica, bay, his, first, meal, as, a, captive, was, a, large, salmon, steak, on, 8, september, 2006, and, as, of, that, date, he, was, estimated, to, be, 1, 72, m, 68, in, in, length, and, to, weigh, approximately, 47, kg, 104, lb, he, was, released, on, 16, january, 2007, after, 137, days, in, captivity, monterey, bay, aquarium, housed, a, third, great, white, a, juvenile, male, for, 162, days, between, 27, august, 2007, and, 5, february, 2008, on, arrival, he, was, 1, 4, m, 4, 6, ft, long, and, weighed, 30, 6, kg, 67, lb, he, grew, to, 1, 8, m, 5, 9, ft, and, 64, kg, 141, lb, before, release, a, juvenile, female, came, to, the, outer, bay, exhibit, on, 27, august, 2008, while, she, did, swim, well, the, shark, fed, only, once, during, her, stay, and, was, tagged, and, released, on, 7, september, 2008, another, juvenile, female, was, captured, near, malibu, on, 12, august, 2009, introduced, to, the, outer, bay, exhibit, on, 26, august, 2009, and, was, successfully, released, into, the, wild, on, 4, november, 2009, the, monterey, bay, aquarium, introduced, a, 1, 4, m, long, male, into, their, redesigned, open, sea, exhibit, on, 31, august, 2011, he, was, exhibited, for, 55, days, and, was, released, into, the, wild, on, 25, october, the, same, year, however, the, shark, was, determined, to, have, died, shortly, after, release, via, an, attached, electronic, tag, the, cause, of, death, is, not, known, the, monterey, bay, aquarium, does, not, plan, to, exhibit, any, more, great, whites, as, the, main, purpose, of, containing, them, was, scientific, as, data, from, captive, great, whites, were, no, longer, needed, the, institute, has, instead, shifted, its, focus, to, study, wild, sharks, one, of, the, largest, adult, great, whites, ever, exhibited, was, at, japan, s, okinawa, churaumi, aquarium, in, 2016, where, a, 3, 5, m, 11, ft, male, was, exhibited, for, three, days, before, dying, perhaps, the, most, famous, captive, was, a, 2, 4, m, 7, 9, ft, female, named, sandy, which, in, august, 1980, became, the, only, great, white, to, be, housed, at, the, california, academy, of, sciences, steinhart, aquarium, in, san, francisco, california, she, was, released, because, she, would, not, eat, and, constantly, bumped, against, the, walls, due, to, the, vast, amounts, of, resources, required, and, the, subsequent, cost, to, keep, a, great, white, shark, alive, in, captivity, their, dietary, preferences, size, migratory, nature, and, the, stress, of, capture, and, containment, permanent, exhibition, of, a, great, white, shark, is, likely, to, be, unfeasible, cage, diving, is, most, common, at, sites, where, great, whites, are, frequent, including, the, coast, of, south, africa, the, neptune, islands, in, south, australia, and, guadalupe, island, in, baja, california, the, popularity, of, cage, diving, and, swimming, with, sharks, is, at, the, focus, of, a, booming, tourist, industry, a, common, practice, is, to, chum, the, water, with, pieces, of, fish, to, attract, the, sharks, these, practices, may, make, sharks, more, accustomed, to, people, in, their, environment, and, to, associate, human, activity, with, food, a, potentially, dangerous, situation, by, drawing, bait, on, a, wire, towards, the, cage, tour, operators, lure, the, shark, to, the, cage, possibly, striking, it, exacerbating, this, problem, other, operators, draw, the, bait, away, from, the, cage, causing, the, shark, to, swim, past, the, divers, at, present, hang, baits, are, illegal, off, isla, guadalupe, and, reputable, dive, operators, do, not, use, them, operators, in, south, africa, and, australia, continue, to, use, hang, baits, and, pinniped, decoys, in, south, australia, playing, rock, music, recordings, underwater, including, the, ac, dc, album, back, in, black, has, also, been, used, experimentally, to, attract, sharks, companies, object, to, being, blamed, for, shark, bite, incidents, pointing, out, that, lightning, tends, to, strike, humans, more, often, than, sharks, bite, humans, their, position, is, that, further, research, needs, to, be, done, before, banning, practices, such, as, chumming, which, may, alter, natural, behaviour, one, compromise, is, to, only, use, chum, in, areas, where, whites, actively, patrol, anyway, well, away, from, human, leisure, areas, also, responsible, dive, operators, do, not, feed, sharks, only, sharks, that, are, willing, to, scavenge, follow, the, chum, trail, and, if, they, find, no, food, at, the, end, then, the, shark, soon, swims, off, and, does, not, associate, chum, with, a, meal, it, has, been, suggested, that, government, licensing, strategies, may, help, enforce, these, responsible, tourism, it, is, unclear, how, much, of, a, concurrent, increase, in, fishing, for, great, white, sharks, has, caused, the, decline, of, great, white, shark, populations, from, the, 1970s, to, the, present, no, accurate, global, population, numbers, are, available, but, the, great, white, shark, is, now, considered, vulnerable, worldwide, and, critically, endangered, in, europe, and, the, mediterranean, sharks, taken, during, the, long, interval, between, birth, and, sexual, maturity, never, reproduce, making, population, recovery, and, growth, difficult, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, notes, that, very, little, is, known, about, the, actual, status, of, the, great, white, shark, but, as, it, appears, uncommon, compared, to, other, widely, distributed, species, it, is, considered, vulnerable, it, is, included, in, appendix, ii, of, cites, meaning, that, international, trade, in, the, species, including, parts, and, derivatives, requires, a, permit, as, of, march, 2010, it, has, also, been, included, in, annex, i, of, the, cms, migratory, sharks, mou, which, strives, for, increased, international, understanding, and, coordination, for, the, protection, of, certain, migratory, sharks, a, february, 2010, study, by, barbara, block, of, stanford, university, estimated, the, world, population, of, great, white, sharks, to, be, lower, than, 3, 500, individuals, making, the, species, more, vulnerable, to, extinction, than, the, tiger, whose, population, is, in, the, same, range, according, to, another, study, from, 2014, by, george, h, burgess, florida, museum, of, natural, history, university, of, florida, there, are, about, 2, 000, great, white, sharks, near, the, california, coast, which, is, 10, times, higher, than, the, previous, estimate, of, 219, by, barbara, block, fishermen, target, many, sharks, for, their, jaws, teeth, and, fins, and, as, game, fish, in, general, the, great, white, shark, however, is, rarely, an, object, of, commercial, fishing, although, its, flesh, is, considered, valuable, if, casually, captured, it, happens, for, example, in, some, tonnare, in, the, mediterranean, it, is, misleadingly, sold, as, smooth, hound, shark, the, great, white, shark, was, declared, vulnerable, by, the, australian, government, in, 1999, because, of, significant, population, decline, and, is, currently, protected, under, the, environmental, protection, and, biodiversity, conservation, epbc, act, the, causes, of, decline, prior, to, protection, included, mortality, from, sport, fishing, harvests, as, well, as, being, caught, in, beach, protection, netting, the, national, conservation, status, of, the, great, white, shark, is, reflected, by, all, australian, states, under, their, respective, laws, granting, the, species, full, protection, throughout, australia, regardless, of, jurisdiction, many, states, had, prohibited, the, killing, or, possession, of, great, white, sharks, prior, to, national, legislation, coming, into, effect, the, great, white, shark, is, further, listed, as, threatened, in, victoria, under, the, flora, and, fauna, guarantee, act, and, as, rare, or, likely, to, become, extinct, under, schedule, 5, of, the, wildlife, conservation, act, in, western, australia, in, 2002, the, australian, government, created, the, white, shark, recovery, plan, implementing, government, mandated, conservation, research, and, monitoring, for, conservation, in, addition, to, federal, protection, and, stronger, regulation, of, shark, related, trade, and, tourism, activities, an, updated, recovery, plan, was, published, in, 2013, to, review, progress, research, findings, and, to, implement, further, conservation, actions, a, study, in, 2012, revealed, that, australia, s, white, shark, population, was, separated, by, bass, strait, into, genetically, distinct, eastern, and, western, populations, indicating, a, need, for, the, development, of, regional, conservation, strategies, presently, human, caused, shark, mortality, is, continuing, primarily, from, accidental, and, illegal, catching, in, commercial, and, recreational, fishing, as, well, as, from, being, caught, in, beach, protection, netting, and, the, populations, of, great, white, shark, in, australia, are, yet, to, recover, in, spite, of, official, protections, in, australia, great, white, sharks, continue, to, be, killed, in, state, shark, control, programs, within, australia, for, example, the, government, of, queensland, has, a, shark, control, program, shark, culling, which, kills, great, white, sharks, as, well, as, other, marine, life, using, shark, nets, and, drum, lines, with, baited, hooks, in, queensland, great, white, sharks, that, are, found, alive, on, the, baited, hooks, are, shot, the, government, of, new, south, wales, also, kills, great, white, sharks, in, its, shark, control, program, partly, because, of, these, programs, shark, numbers, in, eastern, australia, have, decreased, the, australasian, population, of, great, white, sharks, is, believed, to, be, in, excess, of, 8, 000, 10, 000, individuals, according, to, genetic, research, studies, done, by, csiro, with, an, adult, population, estimated, to, be, around, 2, 210, individuals, in, both, eastern, and, western, australia, the, annual, survival, rate, for, juveniles, in, these, two, separate, populations, was, estimated, in, the, same, study, to, be, close, to, 73, per, cent, while, adult, sharks, had, a, 93, per, cent, annual, survival, rate, whether, or, not, mortality, rates, in, great, white, sharks, have, declined, or, the, population, has, increased, as, a, result, of, the, protection, of, this, species, in, australian, waters, is, as, yet, unknown, due, to, the, slow, growth, rates, of, this, species, the, great, white, shark, is, one, of, the, most, commonly, found, in, the, waters, of, new, zealand, as, of, april, 2007, great, white, sharks, were, fully, protected, within, 370, km, 230, mi, of, new, zealand, and, additionally, from, fishing, by, new, zealand, flagged, boats, outside, this, range, the, maximum, penalty, is, a, 250, 000, fine, and, up, to, six, months, in, prison, in, june, 2018, the, new, zealand, department, of, conservation, classified, the, great, white, shark, under, the, new, zealand, threat, classification, system, as, nationally, endangered, the, species, meets, the, criteria, for, this, classification, as, there, exists, a, moderate, stable, population, of, between, 1000, and, 5000, mature, individuals, this, classification, has, the, qualifiers, data, poor, and, threatened, overseas, in, addition, to, existing, federal, regulations, great, white, sharks, have, been, protected, under, california, state, law, since, january, 1st, 1994, under, this, law, catching, hunting, pursuit, capturing, and, or, killing, of, great, whites, in, california, waters, is, strictly, prohibited, up, to, 3, mi, 4, 8, km, offshore, though, exceptions, exist, for, great, whites, caught, for, scientific, research, or, unintentionally, caught, as, bycatch, in, both, cases, a, special, permit, is, required, in, order, to, legally, take, them, in, 2013, great, white, sharks, were, added, to, california, s, endangered, species, act, from, data, collected, the, population, of, great, whites, in, the, north, pacific, was, estimated, to, be, fewer, than, 340, individuals, research, also, reveals, these, sharks, are, genetically, distinct, from, other, members, of, their, species, elsewhere, in, africa, australia, and, the, east, coast, of, north, america, having, been, isolated, from, other, populations, a, 2014, study, estimated, the, population, of, great, white, sharks, along, the, california, coastline, to, be, approximately, 2, 400, in, september, 2019, california, governor, gavin, newsom, signed, assembly, bill, 2109, into, law, banning, the, use, of, shark, bait, shark, lures, and, chumming, to, attract, great, whites, in, california, waters, and, prohibiting, their, usage, within, one, nautical, mile, of, any, shoreline, pier, or, jetty, when, a, great, white, is, visible, or, known, to, be, present, in, the, area, in, june, 2015, massachusetts, banned, catching, cage, diving, feeding, towing, decoys, or, baiting, and, chumming, for, its, significant, and, highly, predictable, migratory, great, white, population, without, an, appropriate, research, permit, the, goal, of, these, restrictions, is, to, both, protect, the, sharks, and, public, health
