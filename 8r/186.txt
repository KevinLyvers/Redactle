dopamine, da, a, contraction, of, 3, 4, d, ihydr, o, xy, p, henethyl, amine, is, a, neuromodulatory, molecule, that, plays, several, important, roles, in, cells, it, is, an, organic, chemical, of, the, catecholamine, and, phenethylamine, families, dopamine, constitutes, about, 80, of, the, catecholamine, content, in, the, brain, it, is, an, amine, synthesized, by, removing, a, carboxyl, group, from, a, molecule, of, its, precursor, chemical, l, dopa, which, is, synthesized, in, the, brain, and, kidneys, dopamine, is, also, synthesized, in, plants, and, most, animals, in, the, brain, dopamine, functions, as, a, neurotransmitter, a, chemical, released, by, neurons, nerve, cells, to, send, signals, to, other, nerve, cells, neurotransmitters, are, synthesized, in, specific, regions, of, the, brain, but, affect, many, regions, systemically, the, brain, includes, several, distinct, dopamine, pathways, one, of, which, plays, a, major, role, in, the, motivational, component, of, reward, motivated, behavior, the, anticipation, of, most, types, of, rewards, increases, the, level, of, dopamine, in, the, brain, and, many, addictive, drugs, increase, dopamine, release, or, block, its, reuptake, into, neurons, following, release, other, brain, dopamine, pathways, are, involved, in, motor, control, and, in, controlling, the, release, of, various, hormones, these, pathways, and, cell, groups, form, a, dopamine, system, which, is, neuromodulatory, in, popular, culture, and, media, dopamine, is, often, portrayed, as, the, main, chemical, of, pleasure, but, the, current, opinion, in, pharmacology, is, that, dopamine, instead, confers, motivational, salience, in, other, words, dopamine, signals, the, perceived, motivational, prominence, i, e, the, desirability, or, aversiveness, of, an, outcome, which, in, turn, propels, the, organism, s, behavior, toward, or, away, from, achieving, that, outcome, outside, the, central, nervous, system, dopamine, functions, primarily, as, a, local, paracrine, messenger, in, blood, vessels, it, inhibits, norepinephrine, release, and, acts, as, a, vasodilator, in, the, kidneys, it, increases, sodium, excretion, and, urine, output, in, the, pancreas, it, reduces, insulin, production, in, the, digestive, system, it, reduces, gastrointestinal, motility, and, protects, intestinal, mucosa, and, in, the, immune, system, it, reduces, the, activity, of, lymphocytes, with, the, exception, of, the, blood, vessels, dopamine, in, each, of, these, peripheral, systems, is, synthesized, locally, and, exerts, its, effects, near, the, cells, that, release, it, several, important, diseases, of, the, nervous, system, are, associated, with, dysfunctions, of, the, dopamine, system, and, some, of, the, key, medications, used, to, treat, them, work, by, altering, the, effects, of, dopamine, parkinson, s, disease, a, degenerative, condition, causing, tremor, and, motor, impairment, is, caused, by, a, loss, of, dopamine, secreting, neurons, in, an, area, of, the, midbrain, called, the, substantia, nigra, its, metabolic, precursor, l, dopa, can, be, manufactured, levodopa, a, pure, form, of, l, dopa, is, the, most, widely, used, treatment, for, parkinson, s, there, is, evidence, that, schizophrenia, involves, altered, levels, of, dopamine, activity, and, most, antipsychotic, drugs, used, to, treat, this, are, dopamine, antagonists, which, reduce, dopamine, activity, similar, dopamine, antagonist, drugs, are, also, some, of, the, most, effective, anti, nausea, agents, restless, legs, syndrome, and, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, are, associated, with, decreased, dopamine, activity, dopaminergic, stimulants, can, be, addictive, in, high, doses, but, some, are, used, at, lower, doses, to, treat, adhd, dopamine, itself, is, available, as, a, manufactured, medication, for, intravenous, injection, it, is, useful, in, the, treatment, of, severe, heart, failure, or, cardiogenic, shock, in, newborn, babies, it, may, be, used, for, hypotension, and, septic, shock, a, dopamine, molecule, consists, of, a, catechol, structure, a, benzene, ring, with, two, hydroxyl, side, groups, with, one, amine, group, attached, via, an, ethyl, chain, as, such, dopamine, is, the, simplest, possible, catecholamine, a, family, that, also, includes, the, neurotransmitters, norepinephrine, and, epinephrine, the, presence, of, a, benzene, ring, with, this, amine, attachment, makes, it, a, substituted, phenethylamine, a, family, that, includes, numerous, psychoactive, drugs, like, most, amines, dopamine, is, an, organic, base, as, a, base, it, is, generally, protonated, in, acidic, environments, in, an, acid, base, reaction, the, protonated, form, is, highly, water, soluble, and, relatively, stable, but, can, become, oxidized, if, exposed, to, oxygen, or, other, oxidants, in, basic, environments, dopamine, is, not, protonated, in, this, free, base, form, it, is, less, water, soluble, and, also, more, highly, reactive, because, of, the, increased, stability, and, water, solubility, of, the, protonated, form, dopamine, is, supplied, for, chemical, or, pharmaceutical, use, as, dopamine, hydrochloride, that, is, the, hydrochloride, salt, that, is, created, when, dopamine, is, combined, with, hydrochloric, acid, in, dry, form, dopamine, hydrochloride, is, a, fine, powder, which, is, white, to, yellow, in, color, dopamine, is, synthesized, in, a, restricted, set, of, cell, types, mainly, neurons, and, cells, in, the, medulla, of, the, adrenal, glands, the, primary, and, minor, metabolic, pathways, respectively, are, the, direct, precursor, of, dopamine, l, dopa, can, be, synthesized, indirectly, from, the, essential, amino, acid, phenylalanine, or, directly, from, the, non, essential, amino, acid, tyrosine, these, amino, acids, are, found, in, nearly, every, protein, and, so, are, readily, available, in, food, with, tyrosine, being, the, most, common, although, dopamine, is, also, found, in, many, types, of, food, it, is, incapable, of, crossing, the, blood, brain, barrier, that, surrounds, and, protects, the, brain, it, must, therefore, be, synthesized, inside, the, brain, to, perform, its, neuronal, activity, l, phenylalanine, is, converted, into, l, tyrosine, by, the, enzyme, phenylalanine, hydroxylase, with, molecular, oxygen, o, 2, and, tetrahydrobiopterin, as, cofactors, l, tyrosine, is, converted, into, l, dopa, by, the, enzyme, tyrosine, hydroxylase, with, tetrahydrobiopterin, o, 2, and, iron, fe, 2, as, cofactors, l, dopa, is, converted, into, dopamine, by, the, enzyme, aromatic, l, amino, acid, decarboxylase, also, known, as, dopa, decarboxylase, with, pyridoxal, phosphate, as, the, cofactor, dopamine, itself, is, used, as, precursor, in, the, synthesis, of, the, neurotransmitters, norepinephrine, and, epinephrine, dopamine, is, converted, into, norepinephrine, by, the, enzyme, dopamine, hydroxylase, with, o, 2, and, l, ascorbic, acid, as, cofactors, norepinephrine, is, converted, into, epinephrine, by, the, enzyme, phenylethanolamine, n, methyltransferase, with, s, adenosyl, l, methionine, as, the, cofactor, some, of, the, cofactors, also, require, their, own, synthesis, deficiency, in, any, required, amino, acid, or, cofactor, can, impair, the, synthesis, of, dopamine, norepinephrine, and, epinephrine, dopamine, is, broken, down, into, inactive, metabolites, by, a, set, of, enzymes, monoamine, oxidase, mao, catechol, o, methyl, transferase, comt, and, aldehyde, dehydrogenase, aldh, acting, in, sequence, both, isoforms, of, monoamine, oxidase, mao, a, and, mao, b, effectively, metabolize, dopamine, different, breakdown, pathways, exist, but, the, main, end, product, is, homovanillic, acid, hva, which, has, no, known, biological, activity, from, the, bloodstream, homovanillic, acid, is, filtered, out, by, the, kidneys, and, then, excreted, in, the, urine, the, two, primary, metabolic, routes, that, convert, dopamine, into, hva, are, in, clinical, research, on, schizophrenia, measurements, of, homovanillic, acid, in, plasma, have, been, used, to, estimate, levels, of, dopamine, activity, in, the, brain, a, difficulty, in, this, approach, however, is, separating, the, high, level, of, plasma, homovanillic, acid, contributed, by, the, metabolism, of, norepinephrine, although, dopamine, is, normally, broken, down, by, an, oxidoreductase, enzyme, it, is, also, susceptible, to, oxidation, by, direct, reaction, with, oxygen, yielding, quinones, plus, various, free, radicals, as, products, the, rate, of, oxidation, can, be, increased, by, the, presence, of, ferric, iron, or, other, factors, quinones, and, free, radicals, produced, by, autoxidation, of, dopamine, can, poison, cells, and, there, is, evidence, that, this, mechanism, may, contribute, to, the, cell, loss, that, occurs, in, parkinson, s, disease, and, other, conditions, dopamine, exerts, its, effects, by, binding, to, and, activating, cell, surface, receptors, in, humans, dopamine, has, a, high, binding, affinity, at, dopamine, receptors, and, human, trace, amine, associated, receptor, 1, htaar1, in, mammals, five, subtypes, of, dopamine, receptors, have, been, identified, labeled, from, d, 1, to, d, 5, all, of, them, function, as, metabotropic, g, protein, coupled, receptors, meaning, that, they, exert, their, effects, via, a, complex, second, messenger, system, these, receptors, can, be, divided, into, two, families, known, as, d, 1, like, and, d, 2, like, for, receptors, located, on, neurons, in, the, nervous, system, the, ultimate, effect, of, d, 1, like, activation, d, 1, and, d, 5, can, be, excitation, via, opening, of, sodium, channels, or, inhibition, via, opening, of, potassium, channels, the, ultimate, effect, of, d, 2, like, activation, d, 2, d, 3, and, d, 4, is, usually, inhibition, of, the, target, neuron, consequently, it, is, incorrect, to, describe, dopamine, itself, as, either, excitatory, or, inhibitory, its, effect, on, a, target, neuron, depends, on, which, types, of, receptors, are, present, on, the, membrane, of, that, neuron, and, on, the, internal, responses, of, that, neuron, to, the, second, messenger, camp, d, 1, receptors, are, the, most, numerous, dopamine, receptors, in, the, human, nervous, system, d, 2, receptors, are, next, d, 3, d, 4, and, d, 5, receptors, are, present, at, significantly, lower, levels, inside, the, brain, dopamine, functions, as, a, neurotransmitter, and, neuromodulator, and, is, controlled, by, a, set, of, mechanisms, common, to, all, monoamine, neurotransmitters, after, synthesis, dopamine, is, transported, from, the, cytosol, into, synaptic, vesicles, by, a, solute, carrier, a, vesicular, monoamine, transporter, vmat2, dopamine, is, stored, in, these, vesicles, until, it, is, ejected, into, the, synaptic, cleft, in, most, cases, the, release, of, dopamine, occurs, through, a, process, called, exocytosis, which, is, caused, by, action, potentials, but, it, can, also, be, caused, by, the, activity, of, an, intracellular, trace, amine, associated, receptor, taar1, taar1, is, a, high, affinity, receptor, for, dopamine, trace, amines, and, certain, substituted, amphetamines, that, is, located, along, membranes, in, the, intracellular, milieu, of, the, presynaptic, cell, activation, of, the, receptor, can, regulate, dopamine, signaling, by, inducing, dopamine, reuptake, inhibition, and, efflux, as, well, as, by, inhibiting, neuronal, firing, through, a, diverse, set, of, mechanisms, once, in, the, synapse, dopamine, binds, to, and, activates, dopamine, receptors, these, can, be, postsynaptic, dopamine, receptors, which, are, located, on, dendrites, the, postsynaptic, neuron, or, presynaptic, autoreceptors, e, g, the, d, 2, sh, and, presynaptic, d, 3, receptors, which, are, located, on, the, membrane, of, an, axon, terminal, the, presynaptic, neuron, after, the, postsynaptic, neuron, elicits, an, action, potential, dopamine, molecules, quickly, become, unbound, from, their, receptors, they, are, then, absorbed, back, into, the, presynaptic, cell, via, reuptake, mediated, either, by, the, dopamine, transporter, or, by, the, plasma, membrane, monoamine, transporter, once, back, in, the, cytosol, dopamine, can, either, be, broken, down, by, a, monoamine, oxidase, or, repackaged, into, vesicles, by, vmat2, making, it, available, for, future, release, in, the, brain, the, level, of, extracellular, dopamine, is, modulated, by, two, mechanisms, phasic, and, tonic, transmission, phasic, dopamine, release, like, most, neurotransmitter, release, in, the, nervous, system, is, driven, directly, by, action, potentials, in, the, dopamine, containing, cells, tonic, dopamine, transmission, occurs, when, small, amounts, of, dopamine, are, released, without, being, preceded, by, presynaptic, action, potentials, tonic, transmission, is, regulated, by, a, variety, of, factors, including, the, activity, of, other, neurons, and, neurotransmitter, reuptake, inside, the, brain, dopamine, plays, important, roles, in, executive, functions, motor, control, motivation, arousal, reinforcement, and, reward, as, well, as, lower, level, functions, including, lactation, sexual, gratification, and, nausea, the, dopaminergic, cell, groups, and, pathways, make, up, the, dopamine, system, which, is, neuromodulatory, dopaminergic, neurons, dopamine, producing, nerve, cells, are, comparatively, few, in, number, a, total, of, around, 400, 000, in, the, human, brain, and, their, cell, bodies, are, confined, in, groups, to, a, few, relatively, small, brain, areas, however, their, axons, project, to, many, other, brain, areas, and, they, exert, powerful, effects, on, their, targets, these, dopaminergic, cell, groups, were, first, mapped, in, 1964, by, annica, dahlstr, m, and, kjell, fuxe, who, assigned, them, labels, starting, with, the, letter, a, for, aminergic, in, their, scheme, areas, a1, through, a7, contain, the, neurotransmitter, norepinephrine, whereas, a8, through, a14, contain, dopamine, the, dopaminergic, areas, they, identified, are, the, substantia, nigra, groups, 8, and, 9, the, ventral, tegmental, area, group, 10, the, posterior, hypothalamus, group, 11, the, arcuate, nucleus, group, 12, the, zona, incerta, group, 13, and, the, periventricular, nucleus, group, 14, the, substantia, nigra, is, a, small, midbrain, area, that, forms, a, component, of, the, basal, ganglia, this, has, two, parts, an, input, area, called, the, pars, reticulata, and, an, output, area, called, the, pars, compacta, the, dopaminergic, neurons, are, found, mainly, in, the, pars, compacta, cell, group, a8, and, nearby, group, a9, in, humans, the, projection, of, dopaminergic, neurons, from, the, substantia, nigra, pars, compacta, to, the, dorsal, striatum, termed, the, nigrostriatal, pathway, plays, a, significant, role, in, the, control, of, motor, function, and, in, learning, new, motor, skills, these, neurons, are, especially, vulnerable, to, damage, and, when, a, large, number, of, them, die, the, result, is, a, parkinsonian, syndrome, the, ventral, tegmental, area, vta, is, another, midbrain, area, the, most, prominent, group, of, vta, dopaminergic, neurons, projects, to, the, prefrontal, cortex, via, the, mesocortical, pathway, and, another, smaller, group, projects, to, the, nucleus, accumbens, via, the, mesolimbic, pathway, together, these, two, pathways, are, collectively, termed, the, mesocorticolimbic, projection, the, vta, also, sends, dopaminergic, projections, to, the, amygdala, cingulate, gyrus, hippocampus, and, olfactory, bulb, mesocorticolimbic, neurons, play, a, central, role, in, reward, and, other, aspects, of, motivation, accumulating, literature, shows, that, dopamine, also, plays, a, crucial, role, in, aversive, learning, through, its, effects, on, a, number, of, brain, regions, the, posterior, hypothalamus, has, dopamine, neurons, that, project, to, the, spinal, cord, but, their, function, is, not, well, established, there, is, some, evidence, that, pathology, in, this, area, plays, a, role, in, restless, legs, syndrome, a, condition, in, which, people, have, difficulty, sleeping, due, to, an, overwhelming, compulsion, to, constantly, move, parts, of, the, body, especially, the, legs, the, arcuate, nucleus, and, the, periventricular, nucleus, of, the, hypothalamus, have, dopamine, neurons, that, form, an, important, projection, the, tuberoinfundibular, pathway, which, goes, to, the, pituitary, gland, where, it, influences, the, secretion, of, the, hormone, prolactin, dopamine, is, the, primary, neuroendocrine, inhibitor, of, the, secretion, of, prolactin, from, the, anterior, pituitary, gland, dopamine, produced, by, neurons, in, the, arcuate, nucleus, is, secreted, into, the, hypophyseal, portal, system, of, the, median, eminence, which, supplies, the, pituitary, gland, the, prolactin, cells, that, produce, prolactin, in, the, absence, of, dopamine, secrete, prolactin, continuously, dopamine, inhibits, this, secretion, the, zona, incerta, grouped, between, the, arcuate, and, periventricular, nuclei, projects, to, several, areas, of, the, hypothalamus, and, participates, in, the, control, of, gonadotropin, releasing, hormone, which, is, necessary, to, activate, the, development, of, the, male, and, female, reproductive, systems, following, puberty, an, additional, group, of, dopamine, secreting, neurons, is, found, in, the, retina, of, the, eye, these, neurons, are, amacrine, cells, meaning, that, they, have, no, axons, they, release, dopamine, into, the, extracellular, medium, and, are, specifically, active, during, daylight, hours, becoming, silent, at, night, this, retinal, dopamine, acts, to, enhance, the, activity, of, cone, cells, in, the, retina, while, suppressing, rod, cells, the, result, is, to, increase, sensitivity, to, color, and, contrast, during, bright, light, conditions, at, the, cost, of, reduced, sensitivity, when, the, light, is, dim, the, largest, and, most, important, sources, of, dopamine, in, the, vertebrate, brain, are, the, substantia, nigra, and, ventral, tegmental, area, both, structures, are, components, of, the, midbrain, closely, related, to, each, other, and, functionally, similar, in, many, respects, the, largest, component, of, the, basal, ganglia, is, the, striatum, the, substantia, nigra, sends, a, dopaminergic, projection, to, the, dorsal, striatum, while, the, ventral, tegmental, area, sends, a, similar, type, of, dopaminergic, projection, to, the, ventral, striatum, progress, in, understanding, the, functions, of, the, basal, ganglia, has, been, slow, the, most, popular, hypotheses, broadly, stated, propose, that, the, basal, ganglia, play, a, central, role, in, action, selection, the, action, selection, theory, in, its, simplest, form, proposes, that, when, a, person, or, animal, is, in, a, situation, where, several, behaviors, are, possible, activity, in, the, basal, ganglia, determines, which, of, them, is, executed, by, releasing, that, response, from, inhibition, while, continuing, to, inhibit, other, motor, systems, that, if, activated, would, generate, competing, behaviors, thus, the, basal, ganglia, in, this, concept, are, responsible, for, initiating, behaviors, but, not, for, determining, the, details, of, how, they, are, carried, out, in, other, words, they, essentially, form, a, decision, making, system, the, basal, ganglia, can, be, divided, into, several, sectors, and, each, is, involved, in, controlling, particular, types, of, actions, the, ventral, sector, of, the, basal, ganglia, containing, the, ventral, striatum, and, ventral, tegmental, area, operates, at, the, highest, level, of, the, hierarchy, selecting, actions, at, the, whole, organism, level, the, dorsal, sectors, containing, the, dorsal, striatum, and, substantia, nigra, operate, at, lower, levels, selecting, the, specific, muscles, and, movements, that, are, used, to, implement, a, given, behavior, pattern, dopamine, contributes, to, the, action, selection, process, in, at, least, two, important, ways, first, it, sets, the, threshold, for, initiating, actions, the, higher, the, level, of, dopamine, activity, the, lower, the, impetus, required, to, evoke, a, given, behavior, as, a, consequence, high, levels, of, dopamine, lead, to, high, levels, of, motor, activity, and, impulsive, behavior, low, levels, of, dopamine, lead, to, torpor, and, slowed, reactions, parkinson, s, disease, in, which, dopamine, levels, in, the, substantia, nigra, circuit, are, greatly, reduced, is, characterized, by, stiffness, and, difficulty, initiating, movement, however, when, people, with, the, disease, are, confronted, with, strong, stimuli, such, as, a, serious, threat, their, reactions, can, be, as, vigorous, as, those, of, a, healthy, person, in, the, opposite, direction, drugs, that, increase, dopamine, release, such, as, cocaine, or, amphetamine, can, produce, heightened, levels, of, activity, including, at, the, extreme, psychomotor, agitation, and, stereotyped, movements, the, second, important, effect, of, dopamine, is, as, a, teaching, signal, when, an, action, is, followed, by, an, increase, in, dopamine, activity, the, basal, ganglia, circuit, is, altered, in, a, way, that, makes, the, same, response, easier, to, evoke, when, similar, situations, arise, in, the, future, this, is, a, form, of, operant, conditioning, in, which, dopamine, plays, the, role, of, a, reward, signal, in, the, language, used, to, discuss, the, reward, system, reward, is, the, attractive, and, motivational, property, of, a, stimulus, that, induces, appetitive, behavior, also, known, as, approach, behavior, and, consummatory, behavior, a, rewarding, stimulus, is, one, that, can, induce, the, organism, to, approach, it, and, choose, to, consume, it, pleasure, learning, e, g, classical, and, operant, conditioning, and, approach, behavior, are, the, three, main, functions, of, reward, as, an, aspect, of, reward, pleasure, provides, a, definition, of, reward, however, while, all, pleasurable, stimuli, are, rewarding, not, all, rewarding, stimuli, are, pleasurable, e, g, extrinsic, rewards, like, money, the, motivational, or, desirable, aspect, of, rewarding, stimuli, is, reflected, by, the, approach, behavior, that, they, induce, whereas, the, pleasure, from, intrinsic, rewards, results, from, consuming, them, after, acquiring, them, a, neuropsychological, model, which, distinguishes, these, two, components, of, an, intrinsically, rewarding, stimulus, is, the, incentive, salience, model, where, wanting, or, desire, less, commonly, seeking, corresponds, to, appetitive, or, approach, behavior, while, liking, or, pleasure, corresponds, to, consummatory, behavior, in, human, drug, addicts, wanting, becomes, dissociated, with, liking, as, the, desire, to, use, an, addictive, drug, increases, while, the, pleasure, obtained, from, consuming, it, decreases, due, to, drug, tolerance, within, the, brain, dopamine, functions, partly, as, a, global, reward, signal, an, initial, dopamine, response, to, a, rewarding, stimulus, encodes, information, about, the, salience, value, and, context, of, a, reward, in, the, context, of, reward, related, learning, dopamine, also, functions, as, a, reward, prediction, error, signal, that, is, the, degree, to, which, the, value, of, a, reward, is, unexpected, according, to, this, hypothesis, proposed, by, montague, dayan, and, sejnowski, rewards, that, are, expected, do, not, produce, a, second, phasic, dopamine, response, in, certain, dopaminergic, cells, but, rewards, that, are, unexpected, or, greater, than, expected, produce, a, short, lasting, increase, in, synaptic, dopamine, whereas, the, omission, of, an, expected, reward, actually, causes, dopamine, release, to, drop, below, its, background, level, the, prediction, error, hypothesis, has, drawn, particular, interest, from, computational, neuroscientists, because, an, influential, computational, learning, method, known, as, temporal, difference, learning, makes, heavy, use, of, a, signal, that, encodes, prediction, error, this, confluence, of, theory, and, data, has, led, to, a, fertile, interaction, between, neuroscientists, and, computer, scientists, interested, in, machine, learning, evidence, from, microelectrode, recordings, from, the, brains, of, animals, shows, that, dopamine, neurons, in, the, ventral, tegmental, area, vta, and, substantia, nigra, are, strongly, activated, by, a, wide, variety, of, rewarding, events, these, reward, responsive, dopamine, neurons, in, the, vta, and, substantia, nigra, are, crucial, for, reward, related, cognition, and, serve, as, the, central, component, of, the, reward, system, the, function, of, dopamine, varies, in, each, axonal, projection, from, the, vta, and, substantia, nigra, for, example, the, vta, nucleus, accumbens, shell, projection, assigns, incentive, salience, want, to, rewarding, stimuli, and, its, associated, cues, the, vta, prefrontal, cortex, projection, updates, the, value, of, different, goals, in, accordance, with, their, incentive, salience, the, vta, amygdala, and, vta, hippocampus, projections, mediate, the, consolidation, of, reward, related, memories, and, both, the, vta, nucleus, accumbens, core, and, substantia, nigra, dorsal, striatum, pathways, are, involved, in, learning, motor, responses, that, facilitate, the, acquisition, of, rewarding, stimuli, some, activity, within, the, vta, dopaminergic, projections, appears, to, be, associated, with, reward, prediction, as, well, while, dopamine, has, a, central, role, in, causing, wanting, associated, with, the, appetitive, or, approach, behavioral, responses, to, rewarding, stimuli, detailed, studies, have, shown, that, dopamine, cannot, simply, be, equated, with, hedonic, liking, or, pleasure, as, reflected, in, the, consummatory, behavioral, response, dopamine, neurotransmission, is, involved, in, some, but, not, all, aspects, of, pleasure, related, cognition, since, pleasure, centers, have, been, identified, both, within, the, dopamine, system, i, e, nucleus, accumbens, shell, and, outside, the, dopamine, system, i, e, ventral, pallidum, and, parabrachial, nucleus, for, example, direct, electrical, stimulation, of, dopamine, pathways, using, electrodes, implanted, in, the, brain, is, experienced, as, pleasurable, and, many, types, of, animals, are, willing, to, work, to, obtain, it, antipsychotic, drugs, reduce, dopamine, levels, and, tend, to, cause, anhedonia, a, diminished, ability, to, experience, pleasure, many, types, of, pleasurable, experiences, such, as, sexual, intercourse, eating, and, playing, video, games, increase, dopamine, release, all, addictive, drugs, directly, or, indirectly, affect, dopamine, neurotransmission, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, these, drugs, increase, drug, wanting, leading, to, compulsive, drug, use, when, repeatedly, taken, in, high, doses, presumably, through, the, sensitization, of, incentive, salience, drugs, that, increase, synaptic, dopamine, concentrations, include, psychostimulants, such, as, methamphetamine, and, cocaine, these, produce, increases, in, wanting, behaviors, but, do, not, greatly, alter, expressions, of, pleasure, or, change, levels, of, satiation, however, opiate, drugs, such, as, heroin, and, morphine, produce, increases, in, expressions, of, liking, and, wanting, behaviors, moreover, animals, in, which, the, ventral, tegmental, dopamine, system, has, been, rendered, inactive, do, not, seek, food, and, will, starve, to, death, if, left, to, themselves, but, if, food, is, placed, in, their, mouths, they, will, consume, it, and, show, expressions, indicative, of, pleasure, a, clinical, study, from, january, 2019, that, assessed, the, effect, of, a, dopamine, precursor, levodopa, dopamine, antagonist, risperidone, and, a, placebo, on, reward, responses, to, music, including, the, degree, of, pleasure, experienced, during, musical, chills, as, measured, by, changes, in, electrodermal, activity, as, well, as, subjective, ratings, found, that, the, manipulation, of, dopamine, neurotransmission, bidirectionally, regulates, pleasure, cognition, specifically, the, hedonic, impact, of, music, in, human, subjects, this, research, demonstrated, that, increased, dopamine, neurotransmission, acts, as, a, sine, qua, non, condition, for, pleasurable, hedonic, reactions, to, music, in, humans, a, study, published, in, nature, in, 1998, found, evidence, that, playing, video, games, releases, dopamine, in, the, human, striatum, this, dopamine, is, associated, with, learning, behavior, reinforcement, attention, and, sensorimotor, integration, researchers, used, positron, emission, tomography, scans, and, 11, c, labelled, raclopride, to, track, dopamine, levels, in, the, brain, during, goal, directed, motor, tasks, and, found, that, dopamine, release, was, positively, correlated, with, task, performance, and, was, greatest, in, the, ventral, striatum, this, was, the, first, study, to, demonstrate, the, behavioral, conditions, under, which, dopamine, is, released, in, humans, it, highlights, the, ability, of, positron, emission, tomography, to, detect, neurotransmitter, fluxes, during, changes, in, behavior, according, to, research, potentially, problematic, video, game, use, is, related, to, personality, traits, such, as, low, self, esteem, and, low, self, efficacy, anxiety, aggression, and, clinical, symptoms, of, depression, and, anxiety, disorders, additionally, the, reasons, individuals, play, video, games, vary, and, may, include, coping, socialization, and, personal, satisfaction, the, dsm, 5, defines, internet, gaming, disorder, as, a, mental, disorder, closely, related, to, gambling, disorder, this, has, been, supported, by, some, researchers, but, has, also, caused, controversy, dopamine, does, not, cross, the, blood, brain, barrier, so, its, synthesis, and, functions, in, peripheral, areas, are, to, a, large, degree, independent, of, its, synthesis, and, functions, in, the, brain, a, substantial, amount, of, dopamine, circulates, in, the, bloodstream, but, its, functions, there, are, not, entirely, clear, dopamine, is, found, in, blood, plasma, at, levels, comparable, to, those, of, epinephrine, but, in, humans, over, 95, of, the, dopamine, in, the, plasma, is, in, the, form, of, dopamine, sulfate, a, conjugate, produced, by, the, enzyme, sulfotransferase, 1a3, 1a4, acting, on, free, dopamine, the, bulk, of, this, dopamine, sulfate, is, produced, in, the, mesenteric, organs, the, production, of, dopamine, sulfate, is, thought, to, be, a, mechanism, for, detoxifying, dopamine, that, is, ingested, as, food, or, produced, by, the, digestive, process, levels, in, the, plasma, typically, rise, more, than, fifty, fold, after, a, meal, dopamine, sulfate, has, no, known, biological, functions, and, is, excreted, in, urine, the, relatively, small, quantity, of, unconjugated, dopamine, in, the, bloodstream, may, be, produced, by, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, the, digestive, system, or, possibly, other, organs, it, may, act, on, dopamine, receptors, in, peripheral, tissues, or, be, metabolized, or, be, converted, to, norepinephrine, by, the, enzyme, dopamine, beta, hydroxylase, which, is, released, into, the, bloodstream, by, the, adrenal, medulla, some, dopamine, receptors, are, located, in, the, walls, of, arteries, where, they, act, as, a, vasodilator, and, an, inhibitor, of, norepinephrine, release, from, postganglionic, sympathetic, nerves, terminals, dopamine, can, inhibit, norepinephrine, release, by, acting, on, presynaptic, dopamine, receptors, and, also, on, presynaptic, 1, receptors, like, norepinephrine, itself, these, responses, might, be, activated, by, dopamine, released, from, the, carotid, body, under, conditions, of, low, oxygen, but, whether, arterial, dopamine, receptors, perform, other, biologically, useful, functions, is, not, known, beyond, its, role, in, modulating, blood, flow, there, are, several, peripheral, systems, in, which, dopamine, circulates, within, a, limited, area, and, performs, an, exocrine, or, paracrine, function, the, peripheral, systems, in, which, dopamine, plays, an, important, role, include, the, immune, system, the, kidneys, and, the, pancreas, in, the, immune, system, dopamine, acts, upon, receptors, present, on, immune, cells, especially, lymphocytes, dopamine, can, also, affect, immune, cells, in, the, spleen, bone, marrow, and, circulatory, system, in, addition, dopamine, can, be, synthesized, and, released, by, immune, cells, themselves, the, main, effect, of, dopamine, on, lymphocytes, is, to, reduce, their, activation, level, the, functional, significance, of, this, system, is, unclear, but, it, affords, a, possible, route, for, interactions, between, the, nervous, system, and, immune, system, and, may, be, relevant, to, some, autoimmune, disorders, the, renal, dopaminergic, system, is, located, in, the, cells, of, the, nephron, in, the, kidney, where, all, subtypes, of, dopamine, receptors, are, present, dopamine, is, also, synthesized, there, by, tubule, cells, and, discharged, into, the, tubular, fluid, its, actions, include, increasing, the, blood, supply, to, the, kidneys, increasing, the, glomerular, filtration, rate, and, increasing, the, excretion, of, sodium, in, the, urine, hence, defects, in, renal, dopamine, function, can, lead, to, reduced, sodium, excretion, and, consequently, result, in, the, development, of, high, blood, pressure, there, is, strong, evidence, that, faults, in, the, production, of, dopamine, or, in, the, receptors, can, result, in, a, number, of, pathologies, including, oxidative, stress, edema, and, either, genetic, or, essential, hypertension, oxidative, stress, can, itself, cause, hypertension, defects, in, the, system, can, also, be, caused, by, genetic, factors, or, high, blood, pressure, in, the, pancreas, the, role, of, dopamine, is, somewhat, complex, the, pancreas, consists, of, two, parts, an, exocrine, and, an, endocrine, component, the, exocrine, part, synthesizes, and, secretes, digestive, enzymes, and, other, substances, including, dopamine, into, the, small, intestine, the, function, of, this, secreted, dopamine, after, it, enters, the, small, intestine, is, not, clearly, established, the, possibilities, include, protecting, the, intestinal, mucosa, from, damage, and, reducing, gastrointestinal, motility, the, rate, at, which, content, moves, through, the, digestive, system, the, pancreatic, islets, make, up, the, endocrine, part, of, the, pancreas, and, synthesize, and, secrete, hormones, including, insulin, into, the, bloodstream, there, is, evidence, that, the, beta, cells, in, the, islets, that, synthesize, insulin, contain, dopamine, receptors, and, that, dopamine, acts, to, reduce, the, amount, of, insulin, they, release, the, source, of, their, dopamine, input, is, not, clearly, established, it, may, come, from, dopamine, that, circulates, in, the, bloodstream, and, derives, from, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, or, it, may, be, synthesized, locally, by, other, types, of, pancreatic, cells, dopamine, as, a, manufactured, medication, is, sold, under, the, trade, names, intropin, dopastat, and, revimine, among, others, it, is, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, it, is, most, commonly, used, as, a, stimulant, drug, in, the, treatment, of, severe, low, blood, pressure, slow, heart, rate, and, cardiac, arrest, it, is, especially, important, in, treating, these, in, newborn, infants, it, is, given, intravenously, since, the, half, life, of, dopamine, in, plasma, is, very, short, approximately, one, minute, in, adults, two, minutes, in, newborn, infants, and, up, to, five, minutes, in, preterm, infants, it, is, usually, given, in, a, continuous, intravenous, drip, rather, than, a, single, injection, its, effects, depending, on, dosage, include, an, increase, in, sodium, excretion, by, the, kidneys, an, increase, in, urine, output, an, increase, in, heart, rate, and, an, increase, in, blood, pressure, at, low, doses, it, acts, through, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, to, increase, heart, muscle, contraction, force, and, heart, rate, thereby, increasing, cardiac, output, and, blood, pressure, higher, doses, also, cause, vasoconstriction, that, further, increases, blood, pressure, older, literature, also, describes, very, low, doses, thought, to, improve, kidney, function, without, other, consequences, but, recent, reviews, have, concluded, that, doses, at, such, low, levels, are, not, effective, and, may, sometimes, be, harmful, while, some, effects, result, from, stimulation, of, dopamine, receptors, the, prominent, cardiovascular, effects, result, from, dopamine, acting, at, 1, 1, and, 2, adrenergic, receptors, side, effects, of, dopamine, include, negative, effects, on, kidney, function, and, irregular, heartbeats, the, ld, 50, or, lethal, dose, which, is, expected, to, prove, fatal, in, 50, of, the, population, has, been, found, to, be, 59, mg, kg, mouse, administered, intravenously, 95, mg, kg, mouse, administered, intraperitoneally, 163, mg, kg, rat, administered, intraperitoneally, 79, mg, kg, dog, administered, intravenously, the, dopamine, system, plays, a, central, role, in, several, significant, medical, conditions, including, parkinson, s, disease, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, tourette, syndrome, schizophrenia, bipolar, disorder, and, addiction, aside, from, dopamine, itself, there, are, many, other, important, drugs, that, act, on, dopamine, systems, in, various, parts, of, the, brain, or, body, some, are, used, for, medical, or, recreational, purposes, but, neurochemists, have, also, developed, a, variety, of, research, drugs, some, of, which, bind, with, high, affinity, to, specific, types, of, dopamine, receptors, and, either, agonize, or, antagonize, their, effects, and, many, that, affect, other, aspects, of, dopamine, physiology, including, dopamine, transporter, inhibitors, vmat, inhibitors, and, enzyme, inhibitors, a, number, of, studies, have, reported, an, age, related, decline, in, dopamine, synthesis, and, dopamine, receptor, density, i, e, the, number, of, receptors, in, the, brain, this, decline, has, been, shown, to, occur, in, the, striatum, and, extrastriatal, regions, decreases, in, the, d, 1, d, 2, and, d, 3, receptors, are, well, documented, the, reduction, of, dopamine, with, aging, is, thought, to, be, responsible, for, many, neurological, symptoms, that, increase, in, frequency, with, age, such, as, decreased, arm, swing, and, increased, rigidity, changes, in, dopamine, levels, may, also, cause, age, related, changes, in, cognitive, flexibility, studies, reported, that, dopamine, imbalance, influences, the, fatigue, in, multiple, sclerosis, in, patients, with, multiple, sclerosis, dopamine, inhibits, production, of, il, 17, and, ifn, by, peripheral, blood, mononuclear, cells, parkinson, s, disease, is, an, age, related, disorder, characterized, by, movement, disorders, such, as, stiffness, of, the, body, slowing, of, movement, and, trembling, of, limbs, when, they, are, not, in, use, in, advanced, stages, it, progresses, to, dementia, and, eventually, death, the, main, symptoms, are, caused, by, the, loss, of, dopamine, secreting, cells, in, the, substantia, nigra, these, dopamine, cells, are, especially, vulnerable, to, damage, and, a, variety, of, insults, including, encephalitis, as, depicted, in, the, book, and, movie, awakenings, repeated, sports, related, concussions, and, some, forms, of, chemical, poisoning, such, as, mptp, can, lead, to, substantial, cell, loss, producing, a, parkinsonian, syndrome, that, is, similar, in, its, main, features, to, parkinson, s, disease, most, cases, of, parkinson, s, disease, however, are, idiopathic, meaning, that, the, cause, of, cell, death, cannot, be, identified, the, most, widely, used, treatment, for, parkinsonism, is, administration, of, l, dopa, the, metabolic, precursor, for, dopamine, l, dopa, is, converted, to, dopamine, in, the, brain, and, various, parts, of, the, body, by, the, enzyme, dopa, decarboxylase, l, dopa, is, used, rather, than, dopamine, itself, because, unlike, dopamine, it, is, capable, of, crossing, the, blood, brain, barrier, it, is, often, co, administered, with, an, enzyme, inhibitor, of, peripheral, decarboxylation, such, as, carbidopa, or, benserazide, to, reduce, the, amount, converted, to, dopamine, in, the, periphery, and, thereby, increase, the, amount, of, l, dopa, that, enters, the, brain, when, l, dopa, is, administered, regularly, over, a, long, time, period, a, variety, of, unpleasant, side, effects, such, as, dyskinesia, often, begin, to, appear, even, so, it, is, considered, the, best, available, long, term, treatment, option, for, most, cases, of, parkinson, s, disease, l, dopa, treatment, cannot, restore, the, dopamine, cells, that, have, been, lost, but, it, causes, the, remaining, cells, to, produce, more, dopamine, thereby, compensating, for, the, loss, to, at, least, some, degree, in, advanced, stages, the, treatment, begins, to, fail, because, the, cell, loss, is, so, severe, that, the, remaining, ones, cannot, produce, enough, dopamine, regardless, of, l, dopa, levels, other, drugs, that, enhance, dopamine, function, such, as, bromocriptine, and, pergolide, are, also, sometimes, used, to, treat, parkinsonism, but, in, most, cases, l, dopa, appears, to, give, the, best, trade, off, between, positive, effects, and, negative, side, effects, dopaminergic, medications, that, are, used, to, treat, parkinson, s, disease, are, sometimes, associated, with, the, development, of, a, dopamine, dysregulation, syndrome, which, involves, the, overuse, of, dopaminergic, medication, and, medication, induced, compulsive, engagement, in, natural, rewards, like, gambling, and, sexual, activity, the, latter, behaviors, are, similar, to, those, observed, in, individuals, with, a, behavioral, addiction, cocaine, substituted, amphetamines, including, methamphetamine, adderall, methylphenidate, marketed, as, ritalin, or, concerta, and, other, psychostimulants, exert, their, effects, primarily, or, partly, by, increasing, dopamine, levels, in, the, brain, by, a, variety, of, mechanisms, cocaine, and, methylphenidate, are, dopamine, transporter, blockers, or, reuptake, inhibitors, they, non, competitively, inhibit, dopamine, reuptake, resulting, in, increased, dopamine, concentrations, in, the, synaptic, cleft, 54, 58, like, cocaine, substituted, amphetamines, and, amphetamine, also, increase, the, concentration, of, dopamine, in, the, synaptic, cleft, but, by, different, mechanisms, 147, 150, the, effects, of, psychostimulants, include, increases, in, heart, rate, body, temperature, and, sweating, improvements, in, alertness, attention, and, endurance, increases, in, pleasure, produced, by, rewarding, events, but, at, higher, doses, agitation, anxiety, or, even, loss, of, contact, with, reality, drugs, in, this, group, can, have, a, high, addiction, potential, due, to, their, activating, effects, on, the, dopamine, mediated, reward, system, in, the, brain, however, some, can, also, be, useful, at, lower, doses, for, treating, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, and, narcolepsy, an, important, differentiating, factor, is, the, onset, and, duration, of, action, cocaine, can, take, effect, in, seconds, if, it, is, injected, or, inhaled, in, free, base, form, the, effects, last, from, 5, to, 90, minutes, this, rapid, and, brief, action, makes, its, effects, easily, perceived, and, consequently, gives, it, high, addiction, potential, methylphenidate, taken, in, pill, form, in, contrast, can, take, two, hours, to, reach, peak, levels, in, the, bloodstream, and, depending, on, formulation, the, effects, can, last, for, up, to, 12, hours, these, longer, acting, formulations, have, the, benefit, of, reducing, the, potential, for, abuse, and, improving, adherence, for, treatment, by, using, more, convenient, dosage, regimens, a, variety, of, addictive, drugs, produce, an, increase, in, reward, related, dopamine, activity, stimulants, such, as, nicotine, cocaine, and, methamphetamine, promote, increased, levels, of, dopamine, which, appear, to, be, the, primary, factor, in, causing, addiction, for, other, addictive, drugs, such, as, the, opioid, heroin, the, increased, levels, of, dopamine, in, the, reward, system, may, play, only, a, minor, role, in, addiction, when, people, addicted, to, stimulants, go, through, withdrawal, they, do, not, experience, the, physical, suffering, associated, with, alcohol, withdrawal, or, withdrawal, from, opiates, instead, they, experience, craving, an, intense, desire, for, the, drug, characterized, by, irritability, restlessness, and, other, arousal, symptoms, brought, about, by, psychological, dependence, the, dopamine, system, plays, a, crucial, role, in, several, aspects, of, addiction, at, the, earliest, stage, genetic, differences, that, alter, the, expression, of, dopamine, receptors, in, the, brain, can, predict, whether, a, person, will, find, stimulants, appealing, or, aversive, consumption, of, stimulants, produces, increases, in, brain, dopamine, levels, that, last, from, minutes, to, hours, finally, the, chronic, elevation, in, dopamine, that, comes, with, repetitive, high, dose, stimulant, consumption, triggers, a, wide, ranging, set, of, structural, changes, in, the, brain, that, are, responsible, for, the, behavioral, abnormalities, which, characterize, an, addiction, treatment, of, stimulant, addiction, is, very, difficult, because, even, if, consumption, ceases, the, craving, that, comes, with, psychological, withdrawal, does, not, even, when, the, craving, seems, to, be, extinct, it, may, re, emerge, when, faced, with, stimuli, that, are, associated, with, the, drug, such, as, friends, locations, and, situations, association, networks, in, the, brain, are, greatly, interlinked, psychiatrists, in, the, early, 1950s, discovered, that, a, class, of, drugs, known, as, typical, antipsychotics, also, known, as, major, tranquilizers, were, often, effective, at, reducing, the, psychotic, symptoms, of, schizophrenia, the, introduction, of, the, first, widely, used, antipsychotic, chlorpromazine, thorazine, in, the, 1950s, led, to, the, release, of, many, patients, with, schizophrenia, from, institutions, in, the, years, that, followed, by, the, 1970s, researchers, understood, that, these, typical, antipsychotics, worked, as, antagonists, on, the, d, 2, receptors, this, realization, led, to, the, so, called, dopamine, hypothesis, of, schizophrenia, which, postulates, that, schizophrenia, is, largely, caused, by, hyperactivity, of, brain, dopamine, systems, the, dopamine, hypothesis, drew, additional, support, from, the, observation, that, psychotic, symptoms, were, often, intensified, by, dopamine, enhancing, stimulants, such, as, methamphetamine, and, that, these, drugs, could, also, produce, psychosis, in, healthy, people, if, taken, in, large, enough, doses, in, the, following, decades, other, atypical, antipsychotics, that, had, fewer, serious, side, effects, were, developed, many, of, these, newer, drugs, do, not, act, directly, on, dopamine, receptors, but, instead, produce, alterations, in, dopamine, activity, indirectly, these, drugs, were, also, used, to, treat, other, psychoses, antipsychotic, drugs, have, a, broadly, suppressive, effect, on, most, types, of, active, behavior, and, particularly, reduce, the, delusional, and, agitated, behavior, characteristic, of, overt, psychosis, later, observations, however, have, caused, the, dopamine, hypothesis, to, lose, popularity, at, least, in, its, simple, original, form, for, one, thing, patients, with, schizophrenia, do, not, typically, show, measurably, increased, levels, of, brain, dopamine, activity, even, so, many, psychiatrists, and, neuroscientists, continue, to, believe, that, schizophrenia, involves, some, sort, of, dopamine, system, dysfunction, as, the, dopamine, hypothesis, has, evolved, over, time, however, the, sorts, of, dysfunctions, it, postulates, have, tended, to, become, increasingly, subtle, and, complex, psychopharmacologist, stephen, m, stahl, suggested, in, a, review, of, 2018, that, in, many, cases, of, psychosis, including, schizophrenia, three, interconnected, networks, based, on, dopamine, serotonin, and, glutamate, each, on, its, own, or, in, various, combinations, contributed, to, an, overexcitation, of, dopamine, d, 2, receptors, in, the, ventral, striatum, altered, dopamine, neurotransmission, is, implicated, in, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, a, condition, associated, with, impaired, cognitive, control, in, turn, leading, to, problems, with, regulating, attention, attentional, control, inhibiting, behaviors, inhibitory, control, and, forgetting, things, or, missing, details, working, memory, among, other, problems, there, are, genetic, links, between, dopamine, receptors, the, dopamine, transporter, and, adhd, in, addition, to, links, to, other, neurotransmitter, receptors, and, transporters, the, most, important, relationship, between, dopamine, and, adhd, involves, the, drugs, that, are, used, to, treat, adhd, some, of, the, most, effective, therapeutic, agents, for, adhd, are, psychostimulants, such, as, methylphenidate, ritalin, concerta, and, amphetamine, evekeo, adderall, dexedrine, drugs, that, increase, both, dopamine, and, norepinephrine, levels, in, the, brain, the, clinical, effects, of, these, psychostimulants, in, treating, adhd, are, mediated, through, the, indirect, activation, of, dopamine, and, norepinephrine, receptors, specifically, dopamine, receptor, d, 1, and, adrenoceptor, 2, in, the, prefrontal, cortex, dopamine, plays, a, role, in, pain, processing, in, multiple, levels, of, the, central, nervous, system, including, the, spinal, cord, periaqueductal, gray, thalamus, basal, ganglia, and, cingulate, cortex, decreased, levels, of, dopamine, have, been, associated, with, painful, symptoms, that, frequently, occur, in, parkinson, s, disease, abnormalities, in, dopaminergic, neurotransmission, also, occur, in, several, painful, clinical, conditions, including, burning, mouth, syndrome, fibromyalgia, and, restless, legs, syndrome, nausea, and, vomiting, are, largely, determined, by, activity, in, the, area, postrema, in, the, medulla, of, the, brainstem, in, a, region, known, as, the, chemoreceptor, trigger, zone, this, area, contains, a, large, population, of, type, d, 2, dopamine, receptors, consequently, drugs, that, activate, d, 2, receptors, have, a, high, potential, to, cause, nausea, this, group, includes, some, medications, that, are, administered, for, parkinson, s, disease, as, well, as, other, dopamine, agonists, such, as, apomorphine, in, some, cases, d, 2, receptor, antagonists, such, as, metoclopramide, are, useful, as, anti, nausea, drugs, there, are, no, reports, of, dopamine, in, archaea, but, it, has, been, detected, in, some, types, of, bacteria, and, in, the, protozoan, called, tetrahymena, perhaps, more, importantly, there, are, types, of, bacteria, that, contain, homologs, of, all, the, enzymes, that, animals, use, to, synthesize, dopamine, it, has, been, proposed, that, animals, derived, their, dopamine, synthesizing, machinery, from, bacteria, via, horizontal, gene, transfer, that, may, have, occurred, relatively, late, in, evolutionary, time, perhaps, as, a, result, of, the, symbiotic, incorporation, of, bacteria, into, eukaryotic, cells, that, gave, rise, to, mitochondria, dopamine, is, used, as, a, neurotransmitter, in, most, multicellular, animals, in, sponges, there, is, only, a, single, report, of, the, presence, of, dopamine, with, no, indication, of, its, function, however, dopamine, has, been, reported, in, the, nervous, systems, of, many, other, radially, symmetric, species, including, the, cnidarian, jellyfish, hydra, and, some, corals, this, dates, the, emergence, of, dopamine, as, a, neurotransmitter, back, to, the, earliest, appearance, of, the, nervous, system, over, 500, million, years, ago, in, the, cambrian, period, dopamine, functions, as, a, neurotransmitter, in, vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and, several, types, of, worm, in, every, type, of, animal, that, has, been, examined, dopamine, has, been, seen, to, modify, motor, behavior, in, the, model, organism, nematode, caenorhabditis, elegans, it, reduces, locomotion, and, increases, food, exploratory, movements, in, flatworms, it, produces, screw, like, movements, in, leeches, it, inhibits, swimming, and, promotes, crawling, across, a, wide, range, of, vertebrates, dopamine, has, an, activating, effect, on, behavior, switching, and, response, selection, comparable, to, its, effect, in, mammals, dopamine, has, also, consistently, been, shown, to, play, a, role, in, reward, learning, in, all, animal, groups, as, in, all, vertebrates, invertebrates, such, as, roundworms, flatworms, molluscs, and, common, fruit, flies, can, all, be, trained, to, repeat, an, action, if, it, is, consistently, followed, by, an, increase, in, dopamine, levels, in, fruit, flies, distinct, elements, for, reward, learning, suggest, a, modular, structure, to, the, insect, reward, processing, system, that, broadly, parallels, that, in, the, mammalian, one, for, example, dopamine, regulates, short, and, long, term, learning, in, monkeys, in, fruit, flies, different, groups, of, dopamine, neurons, mediate, reward, signals, for, short, and, long, term, memories, it, had, long, been, believed, that, arthropods, were, an, exception, to, this, with, dopamine, being, seen, as, having, an, adverse, effect, reward, was, seen, to, be, mediated, instead, by, octopamine, a, neurotransmitter, closely, related, to, norepinephrine, more, recent, studies, however, have, shown, that, dopamine, does, play, a, part, in, reward, learning, in, fruit, flies, it, has, also, been, found, that, the, rewarding, effect, of, octopamine, is, due, to, its, activating, a, set, of, dopaminergic, neurons, not, previously, accessed, in, the, research, many, plants, including, a, variety, of, food, plants, synthesize, dopamine, to, varying, degrees, the, highest, concentrations, have, been, observed, in, bananas, the, fruit, pulp, of, red, and, yellow, bananas, contains, dopamine, at, levels, of, 40, to, 50, parts, per, million, by, weight, potatoes, avocados, broccoli, and, brussels, sprouts, may, also, contain, dopamine, at, levels, of, 1, part, per, million, or, more, oranges, tomatoes, spinach, beans, and, other, plants, contain, measurable, concentrations, less, than, 1, part, per, million, the, dopamine, in, plants, is, synthesized, from, the, amino, acid, tyrosine, by, biochemical, mechanisms, similar, to, those, that, animals, use, it, can, be, metabolized, in, a, variety, of, ways, producing, melanin, and, a, variety, of, alkaloids, as, byproducts, the, functions, of, plant, catecholamines, have, not, been, clearly, established, but, there, is, evidence, that, they, play, a, role, in, the, response, to, stressors, such, as, bacterial, infection, act, as, growth, promoting, factors, in, some, situations, and, modify, the, way, that, sugars, are, metabolized, the, receptors, that, mediate, these, actions, have, not, yet, been, identified, nor, have, the, intracellular, mechanisms, that, they, activate, dopamine, consumed, in, food, cannot, act, on, the, brain, because, it, cannot, cross, the, blood, brain, barrier, however, there, are, also, a, variety, of, plants, that, contain, l, dopa, the, metabolic, precursor, of, dopamine, the, highest, concentrations, are, found, in, the, leaves, and, bean, pods, of, plants, of, the, genus, mucuna, especially, in, mucuna, pruriens, velvet, beans, which, have, been, used, as, a, source, for, l, dopa, as, a, drug, another, plant, containing, substantial, amounts, of, l, dopa, is, vicia, faba, the, plant, that, produces, fava, beans, also, known, as, broad, beans, the, level, of, l, dopa, in, the, beans, however, is, much, lower, than, in, the, pod, shells, and, other, parts, of, the, plant, the, seeds, of, cassia, and, bauhinia, trees, also, contain, substantial, amounts, of, l, dopa, in, a, species, of, marine, green, algae, ulvaria, obscura, a, major, component, of, some, algal, blooms, dopamine, is, present, in, very, high, concentrations, estimated, at, 4, 4, of, dry, weight, there, is, evidence, that, this, dopamine, functions, as, an, anti, herbivore, defense, reducing, consumption, by, snails, and, isopods, melanins, are, a, family, of, dark, pigmented, substances, found, in, a, wide, range, of, organisms, chemically, they, are, closely, related, to, dopamine, and, there, is, a, type, of, melanin, known, as, dopamine, melanin, that, can, be, synthesized, by, oxidation, of, dopamine, via, the, enzyme, tyrosinase, the, melanin, that, darkens, human, skin, is, not, of, this, type, it, is, synthesized, by, a, pathway, that, uses, l, dopa, as, a, precursor, but, not, dopamine, however, there, is, substantial, evidence, that, the, neuromelanin, that, gives, a, dark, color, to, the, brain, s, substantia, nigra, is, at, least, in, part, dopamine, melanin, dopamine, derived, melanin, probably, appears, in, at, least, some, other, biological, systems, as, well, some, of, the, dopamine, in, plants, is, likely, to, be, used, as, a, precursor, for, dopamine, melanin, the, complex, patterns, that, appear, on, butterfly, wings, as, well, as, black, and, white, stripes, on, the, bodies, of, insect, larvae, are, also, thought, to, be, caused, by, spatially, structured, accumulations, of, dopamine, melanin, dopamine, was, first, synthesized, in, 1910, by, george, barger, and, james, ewens, at, wellcome, laboratories, in, london, england, and, first, identified, in, the, human, brain, by, katharine, montagu, in, 1957, it, was, named, dopamine, because, it, is, a, monoamine, whose, precursor, in, the, barger, ewens, synthesis, is, 3, 4, d, ihydr, o, xy, p, henyl, a, lanine, levodopa, or, l, dopa, dopamine, s, function, as, a, neurotransmitter, was, first, recognized, in, 1958, by, arvid, carlsson, and, nils, ke, hillarp, at, the, laboratory, for, chemical, pharmacology, of, the, national, heart, institute, of, sweden, carlsson, was, awarded, the, 2000, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, showing, that, dopamine, is, not, only, a, precursor, of, norepinephrine, noradrenaline, and, epinephrine, adrenaline, but, is, also, itself, a, neurotransmitter, research, motivated, by, adhesive, polyphenolic, proteins, in, mussels, led, to, the, discovery, in, 2007, that, a, wide, variety, of, materials, if, placed, in, a, solution, of, dopamine, at, slightly, basic, ph, will, become, coated, with, a, layer, of, polymerized, dopamine, often, referred, to, as, polydopamine, this, polymerized, dopamine, forms, by, a, spontaneous, oxidation, reaction, and, is, formally, a, type, of, melanin, furthermore, dopamine, self, polymerization, can, be, used, to, modulate, the, mechanical, properties, of, peptide, based, gels, synthesis, of, polydopamine, usually, involves, reaction, of, dopamine, hydrochloride, with, tris, as, a, base, in, water, the, structure, of, polydopamine, is, unknown, polydopamine, coatings, can, form, on, objects, ranging, in, size, from, nanoparticles, to, large, surfaces, polydopamine, layers, have, chemical, properties, that, have, the, potential, to, be, extremely, useful, and, numerous, studies, have, examined, their, possible, applications, at, the, simplest, level, they, can, be, used, for, protection, against, damage, by, light, or, to, form, capsules, for, drug, delivery, at, a, more, sophisticated, level, their, adhesive, properties, may, make, them, useful, as, substrates, for, biosensors, or, other, biologically, active, macromolecules, stimulants, phenylethanolamine
