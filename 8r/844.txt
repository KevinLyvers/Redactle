gorilla, gorilla, gorilla, beringei, gorillas, are, herbivorous, predominantly, ground, dwelling, great, apes, that, inhabit, the, tropical, forests, of, equatorial, africa, the, genus, gorilla, is, divided, into, two, species, the, eastern, gorilla, and, the, western, gorilla, and, either, four, or, five, subspecies, the, dna, of, gorillas, is, highly, similar, to, that, of, humans, from, 95, to, 99, depending, on, what, is, included, and, they, are, the, next, closest, living, relatives, to, humans, after, chimpanzees, gorillas, are, the, largest, living, primates, reaching, heights, between, 1, 25, and, 1, 8, metres, weights, between, 100, and, 270, kg, and, arm, spans, up, to, 2, 6, metres, depending, on, species, and, sex, they, tend, to, live, in, troops, with, the, leader, being, called, a, silverback, the, eastern, gorilla, is, distinguished, from, the, western, by, darker, fur, colour, and, some, other, minor, morphological, differences, gorillas, tend, to, live, 35, 40, years, in, the, wild, gorillas, natural, habitats, cover, tropical, or, subtropical, forest, in, sub, saharan, africa, although, their, range, covers, a, small, percentage, of, sub, saharan, africa, gorillas, cover, a, wide, range, of, elevations, the, mountain, gorilla, inhabits, the, albertine, rift, montane, cloud, forests, of, the, virunga, volcanoes, ranging, in, altitude, from, 2, 200, to, 4, 300, metres, 7, 200, to, 14, 100, ft, lowland, gorillas, live, in, dense, forests, and, lowland, swamps, and, marshes, as, low, as, sea, level, with, western, lowland, gorillas, living, in, central, west, african, countries, and, eastern, lowland, gorillas, living, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, near, its, border, with, rwanda, there, are, thought, to, be, around, 316, 000, western, gorillas, in, the, wild, and, 5, 000, eastern, gorillas, both, species, are, classified, as, critically, endangered, by, the, iucn, all, subspecies, are, classified, as, critically, endangered, with, the, exception, of, the, mountain, gorilla, which, is, classified, as, endangered, there, are, many, threats, to, their, survival, such, as, poaching, habitat, destruction, and, disease, which, threaten, the, survival, of, the, species, however, conservation, efforts, have, been, successful, in, some, areas, where, they, live, the, word, gorilla, comes, from, the, history, of, hanno, the, navigator, c, 500, bc, a, carthaginian, explorer, on, an, expedition, to, the, west, african, coast, to, the, area, that, later, became, sierra, leone, members, of, the, expedition, encountered, savage, people, the, greater, part, of, whom, were, women, whose, bodies, were, hairy, and, whom, our, interpreters, called, gorillae, it, is, unknown, whether, what, the, explorers, encountered, were, what, we, now, call, gorillas, another, species, of, ape, or, monkeys, or, humans, skins, of, gorillai, women, brought, back, by, hanno, are, reputed, to, have, been, kept, at, carthage, until, rome, destroyed, the, city, 350, years, later, at, the, end, of, the, punic, wars, 146, bc, in, 1625, andrew, battel, mentioned, the, existence, of, the, animal, under, the, named, of, pongo, this, pongo, is, in, all, proportion, like, a, man, but, he, is, more, like, a, giant, in, stature, than, a, man, for, he, is, very, tall, hath, a, man, s, face, hollow, eyed, with, long, haire, vpon, his, browes, his, face, and, eares, are, without, haire, and, his, hands, also, his, bodie, is, full, of, haire, but, not, very, thicke, and, it, is, a, dunnish, colour, hee, goeth, alwaies, vpon, his, legs, and, carrieth, his, hands, clasped, on, the, nape, of, his, necke, when, he, goeth, upon, the, ground, they, goe, many, together, and, kill, many, negroes, that, trauaile, in, the, woods, those, pongos, are, neuer, taken, aliue, because, they, are, so, strong, that, ten, men, cannot, hold, one, of, them, a, century, and, a, half, after, battel, s, story, was, published, one, writer, claimed, that, the, large, species, described, by, buffon, and, other, authors, as, of, the, size, of, a, man, is, held, by, many, to, be, a, chimera, the, american, physician, and, missionary, thomas, staughton, savage, and, naturalist, jeffries, wyman, first, described, the, western, gorilla, in, 1847, from, specimens, obtained, in, liberia, they, called, it, troglodytes, gorilla, using, the, then, current, name, of, the, chimpanzee, genus, the, species, name, was, derived, from, ancient, greek, gorillai, tribe, of, hairy, women, as, described, by, hanno, the, closest, relatives, of, gorillas, are, the, other, two, homininae, genera, chimpanzees, and, humans, all, of, them, having, diverged, from, a, common, ancestor, about, 7, million, years, ago, human, gene, sequences, differ, only, 1, 6, on, average, from, the, sequences, of, corresponding, gorilla, genes, but, there, is, further, difference, in, how, many, copies, each, gene, has, gibbons, family, hylobatidae, orangutans, genus, pongo, gorillas, genus, gorilla, humans, genus, homo, chimpanzees, genus, pan, until, recently, gorillas, were, considered, to, be, a, single, species, with, three, subspecies, the, western, lowland, gorilla, the, eastern, lowland, gorilla, and, the, mountain, gorilla, there, is, now, agreement, that, there, are, two, species, each, with, two, subspecies, more, recently, a, third, subspecies, has, been, claimed, to, exist, in, one, of, the, species, the, separate, species, and, subspecies, developed, from, a, single, type, of, gorilla, during, the, ice, age, when, their, forest, habitats, shrank, and, became, isolated, from, each, other, primatologists, continue, to, explore, the, relationships, between, various, gorilla, populations, the, species, and, subspecies, listed, here, are, the, ones, upon, which, most, scientists, agree, 2, 600, unknown, the, proposed, third, subspecies, of, gorilla, beringei, which, has, not, yet, received, a, trinomen, is, the, bwindi, population, of, the, mountain, gorilla, sometimes, called, the, bwindi, gorilla, some, variations, that, distinguish, the, classifications, of, gorilla, include, varying, density, size, hair, colour, length, culture, and, facial, widths, population, genetics, of, the, lowland, gorillas, suggest, that, the, western, and, eastern, lowland, populations, diverged, around, 261, thousand, years, ago, wild, male, gorillas, weigh, 136, to, 227, kg, 300, to, 500, lb, while, adult, females, weigh, 68, 113, kg, 150, 250, lb, adult, males, are, 1, 4, to, 1, 8, m, 4, ft, 7, in, to,

in, with, smaller, arm, spans, colin, groves, 1970, calculated, the, average, weight, of, 42, wild, adult, male, gorillas, at, 144, kg, while, smith, and, jungers, 1997, found, the, average, weight, of, 19, wild, adult, male, gorillas, to, be, 169, kg, adult, male, gorillas, are, known, as, silverbacks, due, to, the, characteristic, silver, hair, on, their, backs, reaching, to, the, hips, the, tallest, gorilla, recorded, was, a, 1, 95, m, 6, ft, 5, in, silverback, with, an, arm, span, of, 2, 7, m, 8, ft, 10, in, a, chest, of, 1, 98, m, 6, ft, 6, in, and, a, weight, of, 219, kg, 483, lb, shot, in, alimbongo, northern, kivu, in, may, 1938, the, heaviest, gorilla, recorded, was, a, 1, 83, m, 6, ft, 0, in, silverback, shot, in, ambam, cameroon, which, weighed, 267, kg, 589, lb, males, in, captivity, can, be, overweight, and, reach, weights, up, to, 310, kg, 683, lb, the, eastern, gorilla, is, more, darkly, coloured, than, the, western, gorilla, with, the, mountain, gorilla, being, the, darkest, of, all, the, mountain, gorilla, also, has, the, thickest, hair, the, western, lowland, gorilla, can, be, brown, or, greyish, with, a, reddish, forehead, in, addition, gorillas, that, live, in, lowland, forest, are, more, slender, and, agile, than, the, more, bulky, mountain, gorillas, the, eastern, gorilla, also, has, a, longer, face, and, broader, chest, than, the, western, gorilla, like, humans, gorillas, have, individual, fingerprints, their, eye, colour, is, dark, brown, framed, by, a, black, ring, around, the, iris, gorilla, facial, structure, is, described, as, mandibular, prognathism, that, is, the, mandible, protrudes, farther, out, than, the, maxilla, adult, males, also, have, a, prominent, sagittal, crest, gorillas, move, around, by, knuckle, walking, although, they, sometimes, walk, upright, for, short, distances, typically, while, carrying, food, or, in, defensive, situations, a, 2018, study, investigating, the, hand, posture, of, 77, mountain, gorillas, at, bwindi, impenetrable, national, park, 8, of, the, population, found, that, knuckle, walking, was, done, only, 60, of, the, time, and, they, also, supported, their, weight, on, their, fists, the, backs, of, their, hands, feet, and, on, their, palms, soles, with, the, digits, flexed, such, a, range, of, hand, postures, was, previously, thought, to, have, been, used, by, only, orangutans, studies, of, gorilla, handedness, have, yielded, varying, results, with, some, arguing, for, no, preference, for, either, hand, and, others, right, hand, dominance, for, the, general, population, studies, have, shown, gorilla, blood, is, not, reactive, to, anti, a, and, anti, b, monoclonal, antibodies, which, would, in, humans, indicate, type, o, blood, due, to, novel, sequences, though, it, is, different, enough, to, not, conform, with, the, human, abo, blood, group, system, into, which, the, other, great, apes, fit, a, gorilla, s, lifespan, is, normally, between, 35, and, 40, years, although, zoo, gorillas, may, live, for, 50, years, or, more, in, rare, circumstances, at, 67, years, 252, days, fatou, is, the, oldest, gorilla, ever, oldest, female, gorilla, ever,

gorilla, lives, in, west, central, africa, while, the, eastern, gorilla, lives, in, east, central, africa, between, the, species, and, even, within, the, species, gorillas, live, in, a, variety, of, habitats, and, elevations, gorilla, habitat, ranges, from, montane, forest, to, swampland, eastern, gorillas, inhabit, montane, and, submontane, forests, between, 650, and, 4, 000, m, 2, 130, and, 13, 120, ft, above, sea, level, mountain, gorillas, live, in, montane, forests, at, the, higher, end, of, the, elevation, range, while, eastern, lowland, gorillas, live, in, submontane, forests, at, the, lower, end, in, addition, eastern, lowland, gorillas, live, in, montane, bamboo, forests, as, well, as, lowland, forests, ranging, from, 600, 3, 308, m, 1, 969, 10, 853, ft, in, elevation, western,

shoots, while, fruit, makes, up, a, very, small, part, of, their, diets, mountain, gorilla, food, is, widely, distributed, and, neither, individuals, nor, groups, have, to, compete, with, one, another, their, home, ranges, vary, from, 3, to, 15, km, 2, 1, 2, to, 5, 8, sq, mi, and, their, movements, range, around, 500, m, 0, 31, mi, or, less, on, an, average, day, despite, eating, a, few, species, in, each, habitat, mountain, gorillas, have, flexible, diets, and, can, live, in, a, variety, of, habitats, eastern, lowland, gorillas, have, more, diverse, diets, which, vary, seasonally, leaves, and, pith, are, commonly, eaten, but, fruits, can, make, up, as, much, as, 25, of, their, diets, since, fruit, is, less, available, lowland, gorillas, must, travel, farther, each, day, and, their, home, ranges, vary, from, 2, 7, to, 6, 5, km, 2, 1, 0, to, 2, 5, sq, mi, with, day, ranges, 154, 2, 280, m, 0, 096, 1, 417, mi, eastern, lowland, gorillas, will, also, eat, insects, preferably, ants, western, lowland, gorillas, depend, on, fruits, more, than, the, others, and, they, are, more, dispersed, across, their, range, they, travel, even, farther, than, the, other, gorilla, subspecies, at, 1, 105, m, 0, 687, mi, per, day, on, average, and, have, larger, home, ranges, of, 7, 14, km, 2, 2, 7, 5, 4, sq, mi, western, lowland, gorillas, have, less, access, to, terrestrial, herbs, although, they, can, access, aquatic, herbs, in, some, areas, termites, and, ants, are, also, eaten, gorillas, rarely, drink, water, because, they, consume, succulent, vegetation, that, is, comprised, of, almost, half, water, as, well, as, morning, dew, although, both, mountain, and, lowland, gorillas, have, been, observed, drinking, gorillas, construct, nests, for, daytime, and, night, use, nests, tend, to, be, simple, aggregations, of, branches, and, leaves, about, 2, to, 5, ft, 0, 61, to, 1, 52, m, in, diameter, and, are, constructed, by, individuals, gorillas, unlike, chimpanzees, or, orangutans, tend, to, sleep, in, nests, on, the, ground, the, young, nest, with, their, mothers, but, construct, nests, after, three, years, of, age, initially, close, to, those, of, their, mothers, gorilla, nests, are, distributed, arbitrarily, and, use, of, tree, species, for, site, and, construction, appears, to, be, opportunistic, nest, building, by, great, apes, is, now, considered, to, be, not, just, animal, architecture, but, as, an, important, instance, of, tool, use, gorillas, make, a, new, nest, to, sleep, on, each, day, even, if, remaining, in, the, same, place, they, do, not, use, the, previous, one, usually, they, are, made, an, hour, before, dusk, to, be, ready, to, sleep, when, night, falls, gorillas, sleep, longer, than, humans, an, average, of, 12, hours, per, day, one, possible, predator, of, gorillas, is, the, leopard, gorilla, remains, have, been, found, in, leopard, scat, but, this, may, be, the, result, of, scavenging, when, the, group, is, attacked, by, humans, leopards, or, other, gorillas, an, individual, silverback, will, protect, the, group, even, at, the, cost, of, his, own, life, gorillas, do, not, appear, to, directly, compete, with, chimpanzees, in, areas, where, they, overlap, when, fruit, is, abundant, gorilla, and, chimpanzee, diets, converge, but, when, fruit, is, scarce, gorillas, resort, to, vegetation, the, two, apes, may, also, feed, on, different, species, whether, fruit, or, insects, gorillas, and, chimpanzees, may, ignore, or, avoid, each, other, when, feeding, on, the, same, tree, but, they, have, also, been, documented, to, form, social, bonds, conversely, coalitions, of, chimpanzees, have, been, observed, attacking, families, of, gorillas, including, silverbacks, and, killing, infants, gorillas, live, in, groups, called, troops, troops, tend, to, be, made, of, one, adult, male, or, silverback, with, a, harem, of, multiple, adult, females, and, their, offspring, however, multiple, male, troops, also, exist, a, silverback, is, typically, more, than, 12, years, of, age, and, is, named, for, the, distinctive, patch, of, silver, hair, on, his, back, which, comes, with, maturity, silverbacks, have, large, canine, teeth, that, also, come, with, maturity, both, males, and, females, tend, to, emigrate, from, their, natal, groups, for, mountain, gorillas, females, disperse, from, their, natal, troops, more, than, males, mountain, gorillas, and, western, lowland, gorillas, also, commonly, transfer, to, second, new, groups, mature, males, also, tend, to, leave, their, groups, and, establish, their, own, troops, by, attracting, emigrating, females, however, male, mountain, gorillas, sometimes, stay, in, their, natal, troops, and, become, subordinate, to, the, silverback, if, the, silverback, dies, these, males, may, be, able, to, become, dominant, or, mate, with, the, females, this, behaviour, has, not, been, observed, in, eastern, lowland, gorillas, in, a, single, male, group, when, the, silverback, dies, the, females, and, their, offspring, disperse, and, find, a, new, troop, without, a, silverback, to, protect, them, the, infants, will, likely, fall, victim, to, infanticide, joining, a, new, group, is, likely, to, be, a, tactic, against, this, however, while, gorilla, troops, usually, disband, after, the, silverback, dies, female, eastern, lowlands, gorillas, and, their, offspring, have, been, recorded, staying, together, until, a, new, silverback, transfers, into, the, group, this, likely, serves, as, protection, from, leopards, the, silverback, is, the, centre, of, the, troop, s, attention, making, all, the, decisions, mediating, conflicts, determining, the, movements, of, the, group, leading, the, others, to, feeding, sites, and, taking, responsibility, for, the, safety, and, well, being, of, the, troop, younger, males, subordinate, to, the, silverback, known, as, blackbacks, may, serve, as, backup, protection, blackbacks, are, aged, between, 8, and, 12, years, and, lack, the, silver, back, hair, the, bond, that, a, silverback, has, with, his, females, forms, the, core, of, gorilla, social, life, bonds, between, them, are, maintained, by, grooming, and, staying, close, together, females, form, strong, relationships, with, males, to, gain, mating, opportunities, and, protection, from, predators, and, infanticidal, outside, males, however, aggressive, behaviours, between, males, and, females, do, occur, but, rarely, lead, to, serious, injury, relationships, between, females, may, vary, maternally, related, females, in, a, troop, tend, to, be, friendly, towards, each, other, and, associate, closely, otherwise, females, have, few, friendly, encounters, and, commonly, act, aggressively, towards, each, other, females, may, fight, for, social, access, to, males, and, a, male, may, intervene, male, gorillas, have, weak, social, bonds, particularly, in, multiple, male, groups, with, apparent, dominance, hierarchies, and, strong, competition, for, mates, males, in, all, male, groups, though, tend, to, have, friendly, interactions, and, socialise, through, play, grooming, and, staying, together, and, occasionally, they, even, engage, in, homosexual, interactions, severe, aggression, is, rare, in, stable, groups, but, when, two, mountain, gorilla, groups, meet, the, two, silverbacks, can, sometimes, engage, in, a, fight, to, the, death, using, their, canines, to, cause, deep, gaping, injuries, females, mature, at, 10, 12, years, earlier, in, captivity, and, males, at, 11, 13, years, a, female, s, first, ovulatory, cycle, occurs, when, she, is, six, years, of, age, and, is, followed, by, a, two, year, period, of, adolescent, infertility, the, estrous, cycle, lasts, 30, 33, days, with, outward, ovulation, signs, subtle, compared, to, those, of, chimpanzees, the, gestation, period, lasts, 8, 5, months, female, mountain, gorillas, first, give, birth, at, 10, years, of, age, and, have, four, year, interbirth, intervals, males, can, be, fertile, before, reaching, adulthood, gorillas, mate, year, round, females, will, purse, their, lips, and, slowly, approach, a, male, while, making, eye, contact, this, serves, to, urge, the, male, to, mount, her, if, the, male, does, not, respond, then, she, will, try, to, attract, his, attention, by, reaching, towards, him, or, slapping, the, ground, in, multiple, male, groups, solicitation, indicates, female, preference, but, females, can, be, forced, to, mate, with, multiple, males, males, incite, copulation, by, approaching, a, female, and, displaying, at, her, or, touching, her, and, giving, a, train, grunt, recently, gorillas, have, been, observed, engaging, in, face, to, face, sex, a, trait, once, considered, unique, to, humans, and, bonobos, gorilla, infants, are, vulnerable, and, dependent, thus, mothers, their, primary, caregivers, are, important, to, their, survival, male, gorillas, are, not, active, in, caring, for, the, young, but, they, do, play, a, role, in, socialising, them, to, other, youngsters, the, silverback, has, a, largely, supportive, relationship, with, the, infants, in, his, troop, and, shields, them, from, aggression, within, the, group, infants, remain, in, contact, with, their, mothers, for, the, first, five, months, and, mothers, stay, near, the, silverback,

used, during, social, interactions, when, discipline, is, required, screams, and, roars, signal, alarm, or, warning, and, are, produced, most, often, by, silverbacks, deep, rumbling, belches, suggest, contentment, and, are, heard, frequently, during, feeding, and, resting, periods, they, are, the, most, common, form, of, intragroup, communication, for, this, reason, conflicts, are, most, often,

some, researchers, believe, gorillas, have, spiritual, feelings, or, religious, sentiments, they, have, been, shown, to, have, cultures, in, different, areas, revolving, around, different, methods, of, food, preparation, and, will, show, individual, colour, preferences, the, following, observations, were, made, by, a, team, led, by, thomas, breuer, of, the, wildlife, conservation, society, in, september, 2005, gorillas, are, now, known, to, use, tools, in, the, wild, a, female, gorilla, in, the, nouabal, ndoki, national, park, in, the, republic, of, congo, was, recorded, using, a, stick,

this, means, all, of, the, great, apes, are, now, known, to, use, tools, in, september, 2005, a, two, and, a, half, year, old, gorilla, in, the, republic, of, congo, was, discovered, using, rocks, to, smash, open, palm, nuts, inside, a, game, sanctuary, while, this, was, the, first, such, observation, for, a, gorilla, over, 40, years, previously, chimpanzees, had, been, seen, using, tools, in, the, wild, fishing, for, termites, nonhuman, great, apes, are, endowed, with, semiprecision, grips, and, have, been, able, to, use, both, simple, tools, and, even, weapons, such, as, improvising, a, club, from, a, convenient, fallen, branch, american, physician, and, missionary, thomas, staughton, savage, obtained, the, first, specimens, the, skull, and, other, bones, during, his, time, in, liberia, the, first, scientific, description, of, gorillas, dates, back, to, an, article, by, savage, and, the, naturalist, jeffries, wyman, in, 1847, in, proceedings, of, the, boston, society, of, natural, history, where, troglodytes, gorilla, is, described, now, known, as, the, western, gorilla, other, species, of, gorilla, were, described, in, the, next, few, years, the, explorer, paul, du, chaillu, was, the, first, westerner, to, see, a, live, gorilla, during, his, travel, through, western, equatorial, africa, from, 1856, to, 1859, he, brought, dead, specimens, to, the, uk, in, 1861, the, first, systematic, study, was, not, conducted, until, the, 1920s, when, carl, akeley, of, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, traveled, to, africa, to, hunt, for, an, animal, to, be, shot, and, stuffed, on, his, first, trip, he, was, accompanied, by, his, friends, mary, bradley, a, mystery, writer, her, husband, and, their, young, daughter, alice, who, would, later, write, science, fiction, under, the, pseudonym, james, tiptree, jr, after, their, trip, mary, bradley, wrote, on, the, gorilla, trail, she, later, became, an, advocate, for, the, conservation, of, gorillas, and, wrote, several, more, books, mainly, for, children, in, the, late, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, robert, yerkes, and, his, wife, ava, helped, further, the, study, of, gorillas, when, they, sent, harold, bigham, to, africa, yerkes, also, wrote, a, book, in, 1929, about, the, great, apes, after, world, war, ii, george, schaller, was, one, of, the, first, researchers, to, go, into, the, field, and, study, primates, in, 1959, he, conducted, a, systematic, study, of, the, mountain, gorilla, in, the, wild, and, published, his, work, years, later, at, the, behest, of, louis, leakey, and, the, national, geographic, dian, fossey, conducted, a, much, longer, and, more, comprehensive, study, of, the, mountain, gorilla, when, she, published, her, work, many, misconceptions, and, myths, about, gorillas, were, finally, disproved, including, the, myth, that, gorillas, are, violent, western, lowland, gorillas, g, g, gorilla, are, believed, to, be, one, of, the, zoonotic, origins, of, hiv, aids, the, sivgor, simian, immunodeficiency, virus, that, infects, them, is, similar, to, a, certain, strain, of, hiv, 1, the, gorilla, became, the, next, to, last, great, ape, genus, to, have, its, genome, sequenced, the, first, gorilla, genome, was, generated, with, short, read, and, sanger, sequencing, using, dna, from, a, female, western, lowland, gorilla, named, kamilah, this, gave, scientists, further, insight, into, the, evolution, and, origin, of, humans, despite, the, chimpanzees, being, the, closest, extant, relatives, of, humans, 15, of, the, human, genome, was, found, to, be, more, like, that, of, the, gorilla, in, addition, 30, of, the, gorilla, genome, is, closer, to, human, or, chimpanzee, than, the, latter, are, to, each, other, this, is, rarer, around, coding, genes, indicating, pervasive, selection, throughout, great, ape, evolution, and, has, functional, consequences, in, gene, expression, analysis, of, the, gorilla, genome, has, cast, doubt, on, the, idea, that, the, rapid, evolution, of, hearing, genes, gave, rise, to, language, in, humans, as, it, also, occurred, in, gorillas, gorillas, became, highly, prized, by, western, zoos, since, the, 19th, century, though, the, earliest, attempts, to, keep, them, in, captive, facilities, ended, in, their, early, death, in, the, late, 1920s, the, care, of, captive, gorillas, significantly, improved, colo, december, 22, 1956, january, 17, 2017, of, the, columbus, zoo, and, aquarium, was, the, first, gorilla, to, be, born, in, captivity, captive, gorillas, exhibit, stereotypic, behaviors, including, eating, disorders, such, as, regurgitation, reingestion, and, coprophagy, self, injurious, or, conspecific, aggression, pacing, rocking, sucking, of, fingers, or, lip, smacking, and, overgrooming, negative, vigilance, of, visitor, behaviors, have, been, identified, as, starting, posturing, and, charging, at, visitors, groups, of, bachelor, gorillas, containing, young, silverbacks, have, significantly, higher, levels, of, aggression, and, wounding, rates, than, mixed, age, and, sex, groups, the, use, of, both, internal, and, external, privacy, screens, on, exhibit, windows, has, been, shown, to, alleviate, stresses, from, visual, effects, of, high, crowd, densities, leading, to, decreased, stereotypic, behaviors, in, the, gorillas, playing, naturalistic, auditory, stimuli, as, opposed, to, classical, music, rock, music, or, no, auditory, enrichment, which, allows, for, crowd, noise, machinery, etc, to, be, heard, has, been, noted, to, reduce, stress, behavior, as, well, enrichment, modifications, to, feed, and, foraging, where, clover, hay, is, added, to, an, exhibit, floor, decrease, stereotypic, activities, while, simultaneously, increasing, positive, food, related, behaviors, recent, research, on, captive, gorilla, welfare, emphasizes, a, need, to, shift, to, individual, assessments, instead, of, a, one, size, fits, all, group, approach, to, understanding, how, welfare, increases, or, decreases, based, on, a, variety, of, factors, individual, characteristics, such, as, age, sex, personality, and, individual, histories, are, essential, in, understanding, that, stressors, will, affect, each, individual, gorilla, and, their, welfare, differently, all, species, and, subspecies, of, gorilla, are, listed, as, endangered, or, critically, endangered, on, the, iucn, red, list, all, gorillas, are, listed, in, appendix, i, of, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, cites, meaning, that, international, export, import, of, the, species, including, in, parts, and, derivatives, is, regulated, around, 316, 000, western, lowland, gorillas, are, thought, to, exist, in, the, wild, 4, 000, in, zoos, thanks, to, conservation, eastern, lowland, gorillas, have, a, population, of, under, 5, 000, in, the, wild, and, 24, in, zoos, mountain, gorillas, are, the, most, severely, endangered, with, an, estimated, population, of, about, 880, left, in, the, wild, and, none, in, zoos, threats, to, gorilla, survival, include, habitat, destruction, and, poaching, for, the, bushmeat, trade, gorillas, are, closely, related, to, humans, and, are, susceptible, to, diseases, that, humans, also, get, infected, by, in, 2004, a, population, of, several, hundred, gorillas, in, the, odzala, national, park, republic, of, congo, was, essentially, wiped, out, by, the, ebola, virus, a, 2006, study, published, in, science, concluded, more, than, 5, 000, gorillas, may, have, died, in, recent, outbreaks, of, the, ebola, virus, in, central, africa, the, researchers, indicated, in, conjunction, with, commercial, hunting, of, these, apes, the, virus, creates, a, recipe, for, rapid, ecological, extinction, in, captivity, it, has, also, been, observed, that, gorillas, can, also, be, infected, with, covid, 19, conservation, efforts, include, the, great, apes, survival, project, a, partnership, between, the, united, nations, environment, programme, and, the, unesco, and, also, an, international, treaty, the, agreement, on, the, conservation, of, gorillas, and, their, habitats, concluded, under, unep, administered, convention, on, migratory, species, the, gorilla, agreement, is, the, first, legally, binding, instrument, exclusively, targeting, gorilla, conservation, it, came, into, effect, on, 1, june, 2008, governments, of, countries, where, gorillas, live, placed, a, ban, on, their, killing, and, trading, but, weak, law, enforcement, still, poses, a, threat, to, them, since, the, governments, rarely, apprehend, poachers, traders, and, consumers, that, rely, on, gorillas, for, profit, in, cameroon, s, lebialem, highlands, folk, stories, connect, people, and, gorillas, via, totems, a, gorilla, s, death, means, the, connected, person, will, die, also, this, creates, a, local, conservation, ethic, many, different, indigenous, peoples, interact, with, wild, gorillas, some, have, detailed, knowledge, the, baka, have, words, to, distinguish, at, least, ten, types, of, gorilla, individuals, by, sex, age, and, relationships, in, 1861, alongside, tales, of, hunting, enormous, gorillas, the, traveller, and, anthropologist, paul, du, chaillu, reported, the, cameroonian, story, that, a, pregnant, woman, who, sees, a, gorilla, will, give, birth, to, one, in, 1911, the, anthropologist, albert, jenks, noted, the, bulu, people, s, knowledge, of, gorilla, behaviour, and, ecology, and, their, gorilla, stories, in, one, such, story, the, gorilla, and, the, child, a, gorilla, speaks, to, people, seeking, help, and, trust, and, stealing, a, baby, a, man, accidentally, kills, the, baby, while, attacking, the, gorilla, even, far, from, where, gorillas, live, savannah, tribes, pursue, cult, like, worship, of, the, apes, some, beliefs, are, widespread, among, indigenous, peoples, the, fang, name, for, gorilla, is, ngi, while, the, bulu, name, is, njamong, the, root, ngi, means, fire, denoting, a, positive, energy, from, the, central, african, republic, to, cameroon, and, gabon, stories, of, reincarnations, as, gorillas, totems, and, transformations, similar, to, those, recorded, by, du, chaillu, are, still, told, in, the, 21st, century, since, gaining, international, attention, gorillas, have, been, a, recurring, element, of, many, aspects, of, popular, culture, and, media, they, were, usually, portrayed, as, murderous, and, aggressive, inspired, by, emmanuel, fr, miet, s, gorilla, carrying, off, a, woman, gorillas, have, been, depicted, kidnapping, human, women, this, theme, was, used, in, films, such, as, ingagi, 1930, and, most, notably, king, kong, 1933, the, comedic, play, the, gorilla, which, debuted, in, 1925, featured, an, escaped, gorilla, taking, a, woman, from, her, house, several, films, would, use, the, escaped, gorilla, trope, including, the, strange, case, of, doctor, rx, 1942, the, gorilla, man, 1943, gorilla, at, large, 1954, and, the, disney, cartoons, the, gorilla, mystery, 1930, and, donald, duck, and, the, gorilla, 1944, gorillas, have, been, used, as, opponents, to, jungle, themed, heroes, such, as, tarzan, and, sheena, queen, of, the, jungle, as, well, as, superheroes, the, dc, comics, supervillain, gorilla, grodd, is, an, enemy, of, the, flash, gorillas, also, serve, as, antagonists, in, the, 1968, film, planet, of, the, apes, more, positive, and, sympathetic, portrayals, of, gorillas, include, the, films, son, of, kong, 1933, mighty, joe, young, 1949, gorillas, in, the, mist, 1988, and, instinct, 1999, and, the, 1992, novel, ishmael, gorillas, have, been, featured, in, video, games, as, well, notably, donkey, kong
