list, of, lilium, species, lilium, l, l, i, m, lil, ee, m, is, a, genus, of, herbaceous, flowering, plants, growing, from, bulbs, all, with, large, and, often, prominent, flowers, they, are, the, true, lilies, lilies, are, a, group, of, flowering, plants, which, are, important, in, culture, and, literature, in, much, of, the, world, most, species, are, native, to, the, northern, hemisphere, and, their, range, is, temperate, climates, and, extends, into, the, subtropics, many, other, plants, have, lily, in, their, common, names, but, do, not, belong, to, the, same, genus, and, are, therefore, not, true, lilies, true, lilies, are, known, to, be, highly, toxic, to, cats, lilies, are, tall, perennials, ranging, in, height, from, 1, 6, ft, 30, 180, cm, they, form, naked, or, tunicless, scaly, underground, bulbs, which, are, their, organs, of, perennation, in, some, north, american, species, the, base, of, the, bulb, develops, into, rhizomes, on, which, numerous, small, bulbs, are, found, some, species, develop, stolons, most, bulbs, are, buried, deep, in, the, ground, but, a, few, species, form, bulbs, near, the, soil, surface, many, species, form, stem, roots, with, these, the, bulb, grows, naturally, at, some, depth, in, the, soil, and, each, year, the, new, stem, puts, out, adventitious, roots, above, the, bulb, as, it, emerges, from, the, soil, these, roots, are, in, addition, to, the, basal, roots, that, develop, at, the, base, of, the, bulb, a, number, of, species, also, produce, contractile, roots, that, move, the, bulbs, deeper, into, the, soil, the, flowers, are, large, often, fragrant, and, come, in, a, wide, range, of, colors, including, whites, yellows, oranges, pinks, reds, and, purples, markings, include, spots, and, brush, strokes, the, plants, are, late, spring, or, summer, flowering, flowers, are, borne, in, racemes, or, umbels, at, the, tip, of, the, stem, with, six, tepals, spreading, or, reflexed, to, give, flowers, varying, from, funnel, shape, to, a, turk, s, cap, the, tepals, are, free, from, each, other, and, bear, a, nectary, at, the, base, of, each, flower, the, ovary, is, superior, borne, above, the, point, of, attachment, of, the, anthers, the, fruit, is, a, three, celled, capsule, seeds, ripen, in, late, summer, they, exhibit, varying, and, sometimes, complex, germination, patterns, many, adapted, to, cool, temperate, climates, most, cool, temperate, species, are, deciduous, and, dormant, in, winter, in, their, native, environment, but, a, few, species, native, to, areas, with, hot, summers, and, mild, winters, lilium, candidum, lilium, catesbaei, lilium, longiflorum, lose, their, leaves, and, enter, a, short, dormant, period, in, summer, or, autumn, sprout, from, autumn, to, winter, forming, dwarf, stems, bearing, a, basal, rosette, of, leaves, until, after, they, have, received, sufficient, chilling, the, stem, begins, to, elongate, in, warming, weather, the, basic, chromosome, number, is, twelve, n, 12, in, 2017, lilies, ranked, as, the, second, most, favorite, flower, among, uk, residents, highlighting, their, enduring, popularity, and, cultural, significance, taxonomical, division, in, sections, follows, the, classical, division, of, comber, species, acceptance, follows, the, world, checklist, of, selected, plant, families, the, taxonomy, of, section, pseudolirium, is, from, the, flora, of, north, america, the, taxonomy, of, section, liriotypus, is, given, in, consideration, of, resetnik, et, al, 2007, the, taxonomy, of, chinese, species, various,

selected, plant, families, as, of, january, 2014, considers, nomocharis, a, separate, genus, in, its, own, right, however, some, authorities, consider, nomocharis, to, be, embedded, within, lilium, rather, than, treat, it, as, a, separate, genus, the, sinomartagon, are, divided, in, 3, paraphyletic, groups, while, the, leucolirion, are, divided, in, 2, paraphyletic, groups, there, are, seven, sections, there, are, 111, species, counted, in, this, genus, for, a, full, list, of, accepted, species, with, their, native, ranges, see, list, of, lilium, species, some, species, formerly, included, within, this, genus, have, now, been, placed, in, other, genera, these, genera, include, cardiocrinum, notholirion, nomocharis, and, fritillaria, the, botanic, name, lilium, is, the, latin, form, and, is, a, linnaean, name, the, latin, name, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, le, rion, generally, assumed, to, refer, to, true, white, lilies, as, exemplified, by, the, madonna, lily, the, word, was, borrowed, from, coptic, dial, fayyumic, hleri, from, standard, hreri, from, demotic, hrry, from, egyptian, hr, t, flower, meillet, maintains, that, both, the, egyptian, and, the, greek, word, are, possible, loans, from, an, extinct, substratum, language, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, ancient, greek, kr, non, was, used, by, the, greeks, albeit, for, lilies, of, any, color, the, term, lily, has, in, the, past, been, applied, to, numerous, flowering, plants, often, with, only, superficial, resemblance, to, the, true, lily, including, water, lily, fire, lily, lily, of, the, nile, calla, lily, trout, lily, kaffir, lily, cobra, lily, lily, of, the, valley, daylily, ginger, lily, amazon, lily, leek, lily, peruvian, lily, and, others, all, english, translations, of, the, bible, render,

extends, across, much, of, europe, across, most, of, asia, to, japan, south, to, india, and, east, to, indochina, and, the, philippines, in, the, new, world, they, extend, from, southern, canada, through, much, of, the, united, states, they, are, commonly, adapted, to, either, woodland, habitats, often, montane, or, sometimes, to, grassland, habitats, a, few, can, survive, in, marshland, and, epiphytes, are, known, in, tropical, southeast, asia, in, general, they, prefer, moderately, acidic, or, lime, free, soils, lilies, are, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, species, including, the, dun, bar, the, proliferation, of, deer, e, g, odocoileus, virginianus, in, north, america, mainly, due, to, factors, such, as, the, elimination, of, large, predators, for, human, safety, is, responsible, there, for, a, downturn, in, lily, populations, in, the, wild, and, is, a, threat, to, garden, lilies, as, well, fences, as, high, as, 8, feet, may, be, required, to, prevent, them, from, consuming, the, plants, an, impractical, solution, for, most, wild, areas, many, species, are, widely, grown, in, the, garden, in, temperate, sub, tropical, and, tropical, regions, numerous, ornamental, hybrids, have, been, developed, they, are, used, in, herbaceous, borders, woodland, and, shrub, plantings, and, as, patio, plants, some, lilies, especially, lilium, longiflorum, form, important, cut, flower, crops, or, potted, plants, these, are, forced, to, flower, outside, of, the, normal, flowering, season, for, particular, markets, for, instance, lilium, longiflorum, for, the, easter, trade, when, it, may, be, called, the, easter, lily, lilies, are, usually, planted, as, bulbs, in, the, dormant, season, they, are, best, planted, in, a, south, facing, northern, hemisphere, slightly, sloping, aspect, in, sun, or, part, shade, at, a, depth, 2, times, the, height, of, the, bulb, except, lilium, candidum, which, should, be, planted, at, the, surface, most, prefer, a, porous, loamy, soil, and, good, drainage, is, essential, most, species, bloom, in, july, or, august, northern, hemisphere, the, flowering, periods, of, certain, lily, species, begin, in, late, spring, while, others, bloom, in, late, summer, or, early, autumn, they, have, contractile, roots, which, pull, the, plant, down, to, the, correct, depth, therefore, it, is, better, to, plant, them, too, shallowly, than, too, deep, a, soil, ph, of, around, 6, 5, is, generally, safe, most, grow, best, in, well, drained, soils, and, plants, are, watered, during, the, growing, season, some, species, and, cultivars, have, strong, wiry, stems, but, those, with, heavy, flower, heads, are, staked, to, stay, upright, the, following, lily, species, and, cultivars, currently, hold, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, confirmed, 2017, numerous, forms, mostly, hybrids, are, grown, for, the, garden, they, vary, according, to, the, species, and, interspecific, hybrids, that, they, derived, from, and, are, classified, in, the, following, broad, groups, the, flowers, can, be, classified, by, flower, aspect, and, form, many, newer, commercial, varieties, are, developed, by, using, new, technologies, such, as, ovary, culture, and, embryo, rescue, aphids, may, infest, plants, leatherjackets, feed, on, the, roots, larvae, of, the, scarlet, lily, beetle, can, cause, serious, damage, to, the, stems, and, leaves, the, scarlet, beetle, lays, its, eggs, and, completes, its, life, cycle, only, on, true, lilies, lilium, and, fritillaries, fritillaria, oriental, rubrum, tiger, and, trumpet, lilies, as, well, as, oriental, trumpets, orienpets, and, turk, s, cap, lilies, and, native, north, american, lilium, species, are, all, vulnerable, but, the, beetle, prefers, some, types, over, others, the, beetle, could, also, be, having, an, effect, on, native, canadian, species, and, some, rare, and, endangered, species, found, in, northeastern, north, america, daylilies, hemerocallis, not, true, lilies, are, excluded, from, this, category, plants, can, suffer, from, damage, caused, by, mice, deer, and, squirrels, slugs, snails, and, millipedes, attack, seedlings, leaves, and, flowers, brown, spots, on, damp, leaves, may, signal, an, infection, of, botrytis, elliptica, also, known, as, lily, blight, lily, fire, and, botrytis, leaf, blight, various, viral, diseases, can, cause, mottling, of, leaves, and, stunting, of, growth, including, lily, curl, stripe, ringspot, and, lily, rosette, virus, lilies, can, be, propagated, in, several, ways, plant, grow, regulators, pgrs, are, used, to, limit, the, height, of, lilies, especially, those, sold, as, potted, plants, commonly, used, chemicals, include, ancymidol, fluprimidol, paclobutrazol, and, uni, conazole, all, of, which, are, applied, to, the, foliage, to, slow, the, biosynthesis, of, gibberellins, a, class, of, plant, hormones, responsible, for, stem, growth, a, comparison, of, meiotic, crossing, over, recombination, in, lily, and, mouse, led, in, 1977, to, the, conclusion, that, diverse, eukaryotes, share, a, common, pattern, of, meiotic, crossing, over, lilium, longiflorum, has, been, used, for, studying, aspects, of, the, basic, molecular, mechanism, of, genetic, recombination, during, meiosis, some, lilium, species, are, toxic, to, cats, this, is, known, to, be, so, especially, for, lilium, longiflorum, though, other, lilium, and, the, unrelated, hemerocallis, can, also, cause, the, same, symptoms, with, equal, lethality, the, true, mechanism, of, toxicity, is, undetermined, but, it, involves, damage, to, the, renal, tubular, epithelium, composing, the, substance, of, the, kidney, and, secreting, collecting, and, conducting, urine, which, can, cause, acute, kidney, failure, veterinary, help, should, be, sought, as, a, matter, of, urgency, for, any, cat, that, is, suspected, of, eating, any, part, of, a, lily, including, licking, pollen, that, may, have, brushed, onto, its, coat, due, to, the, high, mortality, rate, medical, care, should, be, sought, immediately, once, it, is, known, a, cat, came, into, contact, with, lilies, ideally, before, any, symptoms, develop, lily, bulbs, are, starchy, and, edible, as, root, vegetables, though, bulbs, of, some, species, may, be, too, bitter, to, eat, lilium,
