see, list, of, malvaceae, genera, malvaceae, m, l, v, e, s, i, a, s, i, i, or, the, mallows, is, a, family, of, flowering, plants, estimated, to, contain, 244, genera, with, 4225, known, species, well, known, members, of, economic, importance, include, okra, cotton, cacao, roselle, and, durian, there, are, also, some, genera, containing, familiar, ornamentals, such, as, alcea, hollyhock, malva, mallow, and, tilia, lime, or, linden, tree, the, genera, with, the, largest, numbers, of, species, include, hibiscus, 434, species, pavonia, 291, species, sida, 275, species, ayenia, 216, species, dombeya, 197, species, and, sterculia, 181, species, the, circumscription, of, the, malvaceae, is, controversial, the, traditional, malvaceae, sensu, stricto, comprise, a, very, homogeneous, and, cladistically, monophyletic, group, another, major, circumscription, malvaceae, sensu, lato, has, been, more, recently, defined, on, the, basis, that, genetics, studies, have, shown, the, commonly, recognised, families, bombacaceae, tiliaceae, and, sterculiaceae, which, have, always, been, considered, closely, allied, to, malvaceae, s, s, are, not, monophyletic, groups, the, malvaceae, can, be, expanded, to, include, all, of, these, families, so, as, to, compose, a, monophyletic, group, adopting, this, circumscription, the, malvaceae, incorporate, a, much, larger, number, of, genera, this, article, is, based, on, the, second, circumscription, as, presented, by, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, website, the, malvaceae, s, l, hereafter, simply, malvaceae, comprise, nine, subfamilies, a, tentative, cladogram, of, the, family, is, shown, below, the, diamond, denotes, a, poorly, supported, branching, 80, byttnerioideae, 26, genera, 650, species, pan, tropical, especially, south, america, grewioideae, 25, genera, 770, species, pantropical, sterculioideae, 12, genera, 430, species, pan, tropical, tilioideae, three, genera, 50, species, northern, temperate, regions, and, central, america, dombeyoideae, about, 20, genera, about, 380, species, palaeo, tropical, especially, madagascar, and, mascarenes, brownlowioideae, eight, genera, about, 70, species, especially, palaeo, tropical, helicteroideae, eight, to, 12, genera, 10, to, 90, species, tropical, especially, southeast, asia, malvoideae, 78, genera, 1, 670, species, temperate, to, tropical, bombacoideae, 12, genera, 120, species, tropical, especially, africa, and, america, until, recently, relationships, between, these, subfamilies, were, either, poorly, supported, or, almost, completely, obscure, continuing, disagreements, focused, primarily, on, the, correct, circumscription, of, these, subfamilies, including, the, preservation, of, the, family, bombacaceae, a, study, published, in, 2021, presented, a, fully, resolved, phylogenetic, framework, for, malvaceae, s, l, using, genomic, data, for, all, nine, subfamilies, regarding, the, traditional, malvaceae, s, s, the, subfamily, malvoideae, approximately, corresponds, to, that, group, 245, genera, are, currently, accepted, the, relationships, between, the, core, malvales, families, used, to, be, defined, on, the, basis, of, shared, malvean, affinities, these, included, the, presence, of, malvoid, teeth, stems, with, mucilage, canals, and, stratified, wedge, shaped, phloem, these, affinities, were, problematic, because, they, were, not, always, shared, within, the, core, families, later, studies, revealed, more, unambiguous, synapomorphies, within, malvaceae, s, l, synapomorphies, identified, within, malvaceae, s, l, include, the, presence, of, tile, cells, trichomatous, nectaries, and, an, inflorescence, structure, called, a, bicolor, unit, tile, cells, consist, of, vertically, positioned, cells, interspersed, between, and, dimensionally, similar, to, procumbent, ray, cells, evidence, of, malvean, wood, fossils, has, confirmed, their, evolutionary, link, in, malvaceae, s, l, as, well, as, explained, their, diverse, structures, flowers, of, malvaceae, s, l, exhibit, nectaries, consisting, of, densely, arranged, multicellular, hairs, resembling, trichomes, in, most, of, malvaceae, s, l, these, trichomatous, nectaries, are, located, on, the, inner, surface, of, the, sepals, but, flowers, of, the, subfamily, tiliodeae, also, have, present, nectaries, on, the, petals, malvean, flowers, also, share, a, unifying, structure, known, as, a, bicolor, unit, named, for, its, initial, discovery, in, the, flowers, of, theobroma, bicolor, the, bicolor, unit, consists, of, an, ordered, inflorescence, with, determinate, cymose, structures, the, inflorescence, can, branch, off, the, main, axis, creating, separate, orders, of, the, flowers, with, the, main, axis, developing, first, bracts, on, the, peduncle, subtend, axillary, buds, that, become, these, lateral, stalks, one, bract, within, this, whorl, is, a, sterile, bract, the, bicolor, unit, is, a, variable, structure, in, complexity, but, the, presence, of, fertile, and, sterile, bracts, is, a, salient, characteristic, the, english, common, name, mallow, also, applied, to, other, members, of, malvaceae, comes, from, latin, malva, also, the, source, for, the, english, word, mauve, malva, itself, was, ultimately, derived, from, the, word, for, the, plant, in, ancient, mediterranean, languages, cognates, of, the, word, include, ancient, greek, mal, kh, or, mol, kh, modern, greek, mol, kha, modern, arabic, mulukhiyah, and, modern, hebrew, molokhia, most, species, are, herbaceous, plants, or, shrubs, but, some, are, trees, or, lianas, leaves, are, generally, alternate, often, palmately, lobed, or, compound, and, palmately, veined, the, margin, may, be, entire, but, when, dentate, a, vein, ends, at, the, tip, of, each, tooth, malvoid, teeth, stipules, are, present, the, stems, contain, mucous, canals, and, often, also, mucous, cavities, hairs, are, common, and, are, most, typically, stellate, stems, of, bombacoideae, are, often, covered, in, thick, prickles, the, flowers, are, commonly, borne, in, definite, or, indefinite, axillary, inflorescences, which, are, often, reduced, to, a, single, flower, but, may, also, be, cauliflorous, oppositifolious, or, terminal, they, often, bear, supernumerary, bracts, in, the, structure, of, a, bicolor, unit, they, can, be, unisexual, or, bisexual, and, are, generally, actinomorphic, often, associated, with, conspicuous, bracts, forming, an, epicalyx, they, generally, have, five, valvate, sepals, most, frequently, basally, connate, with, five, imbricate, petals, the, stamens, are, five, to, numerous, and, connate, at, least, at, their, bases, but, often, forming, a, tube, around, the, pistils, the, pistils, are, composed, of, two, to, many, connate, carpels, the, ovary, is, superior, with, axial, placentation, with, capitate, or, lobed, stigma, the, flowers, have, nectaries, made, of, many, tightly, packed, glandular, hairs, usually, positioned, on, the, sepals, the, fruits, are, most, often, loculicidal, capsules, schizocarps, or, nuts, self, pollination, is, often, avoided, by, means, of, protandry, most, species, are, entomophilous, pollinated, by, insects, bees, from, the, tribe, emphorini, of, the, apidae, including, ptilothrix, diadasia, and, melitoma, are, known, to, specialize, on, the, plants, a, number, of, species, are, pests, in, agriculture, including, abutilon, theophrasti, and, modiola, caroliniana, and, others, that, are, garden, escapees, cotton, four, species, of, gossypium, kenaf, hibiscus, cannabinus, cacao, theobroma, cacao, kola, nut, cola, spp, and, okra, abelmoschus, esculentus, are, important, agricultural, crops, the, fruit, and, leaves, of, baobabs, are, edible, as, is, the, fruit, of, the, durian, a, number, of, species, including, hibiscus, syriacus, hibiscus, rosa, sinensis, and, alcea, rosea, are, garden, plants
