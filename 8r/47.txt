sexual, dimorphism, is, the, condition, where, sexes, of, the, same, species, exhibit, different, morphological, characteristics, including, characteristics, not, directly, involved, in, reproduction, the, condition, occurs, in, most, dioecious, species, which, consist, of, most, animals, and, some, plants, differences, may, include, secondary, sex, characteristics, size, weight, color, markings, or, behavioral, or, cognitive, traits, male, male, reproductive, competition, has, evolved, a, diverse, array, of, sexually, dimorphic, traits, aggressive, utility, traits, such, as, battle, teeth, and, blunt, heads, reinforced, as, battering, rams, are, used, as, weapons, in, aggressive, interactions, between, rivals, passive, displays, such, as, ornamental, feathering, or, song, calling, have, also, evolved, mainly, through, sexual, selection, these, differences, may, be, subtle, or, exaggerated, and, may, be, subjected, to, sexual, selection, and, natural, selection, the, opposite, of, dimorphism, is, monomorphism, when, both, biological, sexes, are, phenotypically, indistinguishable, from, each, other, common, and, easily, identified, types, of, dimorphism, consist, of, ornamentation, and, coloration, though, not, always, apparent, a, difference, in, the, coloration, of, sexes, within, a, given, species, is, called, sexual, dichromatism, commonly, seen, in, many, species, of, birds, and, reptiles, sexual, selection, leads, to, exaggerated, dimorphic, traits, that, are, used, predominantly, in, competition, over, mates, the, increased, fitness, resulting, from, ornamentation, offsets, its, cost, to, produce, or, maintain, suggesting, complex, evolutionary, implications, but, the, costs, and, evolutionary, implications, vary, from, species, to, species, the, peafowl, constitute, conspicuous, illustrations, of, the, principle, the, ornate, plumage, of, peacocks, as, used, in, the, courting, display, attracts, peahens, at, first, sight, one, might, mistake, peacocks, and, peahens, for, completely, different, species, because, of, the, vibrant, colours, and, the, sheer, size, of, the, male, s, plumage, the, peahen, is, of, a, subdued, brown, coloration, the, plumage, of, the, peacock, increases, its, vulnerability, to, predators, because, it, is, a, hindrance, in, flight, and, it, renders, the, bird, conspicuous, in, general, similar, examples, are, manifold, such, as, in, birds, of, paradise, and, argus, pheasants, another, example, of, sexual, dichromatism, is, that, of, nestling, blue, tits, males, are, chromatically, more, yellow, than, females, it, is, believed, that, this, is, obtained, by, the, ingestion, of, green, lepidopteran, larvae, which, contain, large, amounts, of, the, carotenoids, lutein, and, zeaxanthin, this, diet, also, affects, the, sexually, dimorphic, colours, in, the, human, invisible, ultraviolet, spectrum, hence, the, male, birds, although, appearing, yellow, to, humans, actually, have, a, violet, tinted, plumage, that, is, seen, by, females, this, plumage, is, thought, to, be, an, indicator, of, male, parental, abilities, perhaps, this, is, a, good, indicator, for, females, because, it, shows, that, they, are, good, at, obtaining, a, food, supply, from, which, the, carotenoid, is, obtained, there, is, a, positive, correlation, between, the, chromas, of, the, tail, and, breast, feathers, and, body, condition, carotenoids, play, an, important, role, in, immune, function, for, many, animals, so, carotenoid, dependent, signals, might, indicate, health, frogs, constitute, another, conspicuous, illustration, of, the, principle, there, are, two, types, of, dichromatism, for, frog, species, ontogenetic, and, dynamic, ontogenetic, frogs, are, more, common, and, have, permanent, color, changes, in, males, or, females, ranoidea, lesueuri, is, an, example, of, a, dynamic, frog, with, temporary, color, changes, in, males, during, the, breeding, season, hyperolius, ocellatus, is, an, ontogenetic, frog, with, dramatic, differences, in, both, color, and, pattern, between, the, sexes, at, sexual, maturity, the, males, display, a, bright, green, with, white, dorsolateral, lines, in, contrast, the, females, are, rusty, red, to, silver, with, small, spots, the, bright, coloration, in, the, male, population, attracts, females, and, is, an, aposematic, sign, to, potential, predators, females, often, show, a, preference, for, exaggerated, male, secondary, sexual, characteristics, in, mate, selection, the, sexy, son, hypothesis, explains, that, females, prefer, more, elaborate, males, and, select, against, males, that, are, dull, in, color, independent, of, the, species, vision, similar, sexual, dimorphism, and, mating, choice, are, also, observed, in, many, fish, species, for, example, male, guppies, have, colorful, spots, and, ornamentations, while, females, are, generally, grey, female, guppies, prefer, brightly, colored, males, to, duller, males, in, redlip, blennies, only, the, male, fish, develops, an, organ, at, the, anal, urogenital, region, that, produces, antimicrobial, substances, during, parental, care, males, rub, their, anal, urogenital, regions, over, their, nests, internal, surfaces, thereby, protecting, their, eggs, from, microbial, infections, one, of, the, most, common, causes, for, mortality, in, young, fish, most, flowering, plants, are, hermaphroditic, but, approximately, 6, of, species, have, separate, males, and, females, dioecy, sexual, dimorphism, is, common, in, dioecious, plants, 403, and, dioicous, species, 71, males, and, females, in, insect, pollinated, species, generally, look, similar, to, one, another, because, plants, provide, rewards, e, g, nectar, that, encourage, pollinators, to, visit, another, similar, flower, completing, pollination, catasetum, orchids, are, one, interesting, exception, to, this, rule, male, catasetum, orchids, violently, attach, pollinia, to, euglossine, bee, pollinators, the, bees, will, then, avoid, other, male, flowers, but, may, visit, the, female, which, looks, different, from, the, males, various, other, dioecious, exceptions, such, as, loxostylis, alata, have, visibly, different, sexes, with, the, effect, of, eliciting, the, most, efficient, behavior, from, pollinators, who, then, use, the, most, efficient, strategy, in, visiting, each, gender, of, flower, instead, of, searching, say, for, pollen, in, a, nectar, bearing, female, flower, some, plants, such, as, some, species, of, geranium, have, what, amounts, to, serial, sexual, dimorphism, the, flowers, of, such, species, might, for, example, present, their, anthers, on, opening, then, shed, the, exhausted, anthers, after, a, day, or, two, and, perhaps, change, their, colours, as, well, while, the, pistil, matures, specialist, pollinators, are, very, much, inclined, to, concentrate, on, the, exact, appearance, of, the, flowers, they, serve, which, saves, their, time, and, effort, and, serves, the, interests, of, the, plant, accordingly, some, such, plants, go, even, further, and, change, their, appearance, once, fertilized, thereby, discouraging, further, visits, from, pollinators, this, is, advantageous, to, both, parties, because, it, avoids, damaging, the, developing, fruit, and, wasting, the, pollinator, s, effort, on, unrewarding, visits, in, effect, the, strategy, ensures, that, pollinators, can, expect, a, reward, every, time, they, visit, an, appropriately, advertising, flower, females, of, the, aquatic, plant, vallisneria, americana, have, floating, flowers, attached, by, a, long, flower, stalk, that, are, fertilized, if, they, contact, one, of, the, thousands, of, free, floating, flowers, released, by, a, male, sexual, dimorphism, is, most, often, associated, with, wind, pollination, in, plants, due, to, selection, for, efficient, pollen, dispersal, in, males, vs, pollen, capture, in, females, e, g, leucadendron, rubrum, sexual, dimorphism, in, plants, can, also, be, dependent, on, reproductive, development, this, can, be, seen, in, cannabis, sativa, a, type, of, hemp, which, have, higher, photosynthesis, rates, in, males, while, growing, but, higher, rates, in, females, once, the, plants, become, sexually, mature, every, sexually, reproducing, extant, species, of, the, vascular, plant, has, an, alternation, of, generations, the, plants, we, see, about, us, generally, are, diploid, sporophytes, but, their, offspring, are, not, the, seeds, that, people, commonly, recognize, as, the, new, generation, the, seed, actually, is, the, offspring, of, the, haploid, generation, of, microgametophytes, pollen, and, megagametophytes, the, embryo, sacs, in, the, ovules, each, pollen, grain, accordingly, may, be, seen, as, a, male, plant, in, its, own, right, it, produces, a, sperm, cell, and, is, dramatically, different, from, the, female, plant, the, megagametophyte, that, produces, the, female, gamete, insects, display, a, wide, variety, of, sexual, dimorphism, between, taxa, including, size, ornamentation, and, coloration, the, female, biased, sexual, size, dimorphism, observed, in, many, taxa, evolved, despite, intense, male, male, competition, for, mates, in, osmia, rufa, for, example, the, female, is, larger, broader, than, males, with, males, being, 8, 10, mm, in, size, and, females, being, 10, 12, mm, in, size, in, the, hackberry, emperor, females, are, similarly, larger, than, males, the, reason, for, the, sexual, dimorphism, is, due, to, provision, size, mass, in, which, females, consume, more, pollen, than, males, in, some, species, there, is, evidence, of, male, dimorphism, but, it, appears, to, be, for, distinctions, of, roles, this, is, seen, in, the, bee, species, macrotera, portalis, in, which, there, is, a, small, headed, morph, capable, of, flight, and, large, headed, morph, incapable, of, flight, for, males, anthidium, manicatum, also, displays, male, biased, sexual, dimorphism, the, selection, for, larger, size, in, males, rather, than, females, in, this, species, may, have, resulted, due, to, their, aggressive, territorial, behavior, and, subsequent, differential, mating, success, another, example, is, lasioglossum, hemichalceum, which, is, a, species, of, sweat, bee, that, shows, drastic, physical, dimorphisms, between, male, offspring, not, all, dimorphism, has, to, have, a, drastic, difference, between, the, sexes, andrena, agilissima, is, a, mining, bee, where, the, females, only, have, a, slightly, larger, head, than, the, males, weaponry, leads, to, increased, fitness, by, increasing, success, in, male, male, competition, in, many, insect, species, the, beetle, horns, in, onthophagus, taurus, are, enlarged, growths, of, the, head, or, thorax, expressed, only, in, the, males, copris, ochus, also, has, distinct, sexual, and, male, dimorphism, in, head, horns, another, beetle, with, a, distinct, horn, related, sexual, dimorphism, is, allomyrina, dichotoma, also, known, as, the, japanese, rhinoceros, beetle, these, structures, are, impressive, because, of, the, exaggerated, sizes, there, is, a, direct, correlation, between, male, horn, lengths, and, body, size, and, higher, access, to, mates, and, fitness, in, other, beetle, species, both, males, and, females, may, have, ornamentation, such, as, horns, generally, insect, sexual, size, dimorphism, ssd, within, species, increases, with, body, size, sexual, dimorphism, within, insects, is, also, displayed, by, dichromatism, in, butterfly, genera, bicyclus, and, junonia, dimorphic, wing, patterns, evolved, due, to, sex, limited, expression, which, mediates, the, intralocus, sexual, conflict, and, leads, to, increased, fitness, in, males, the, sexual, dichromatic, nature, of, bicyclus, anynana, is, reflected, by, female, selection, on, the, basis, of, dorsal, uv, reflective, eyespot, pupils, the, common, brimstone, also, displays, sexual, dichromatism, males, have, yellow, and, iridescent, wings, while, female, wings, are, white, and, non, iridescent, naturally, selected, deviation, in, protective, female, coloration, is, displayed, in, mimetic, butterflies, many, arachnid, groups, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, but, it, is, most, widely, studied, in, the, spiders, in, the, orb, weaving, spider, zygiella, x, notata, for, example, adult, females, have, a, larger, body, size, than, adult, males, size, dimorphism, shows, a, correlation, with, sexual, cannibalism, which, is, prominent, in, spiders, it, is, also, found, in, insects, such, as, praying, mantises, in, the, size, dimorphic, wolf, spider, tigrosa, helluo, food, limited, females, cannibalize, more, frequently, therefore, there, is, a, high, risk, of, low, fitness, for, males, due, to, pre, copulatory, cannibalism, which, led, to, male, selection, of, larger, females, for, two, reasons, higher, fecundity, and, lower, rates, of, cannibalism, in, addition, female, fecundity, is, positively, correlated, with, female, body, size, and, large, female, body, size, is, selected, for, which, is, seen, in, the, family, araneidae, all, argiope, species, including, argiope, bruennichi, use, this, method, some, males, evolved, ornamentation, including, binding, the, female, with, silk, having, proportionally, longer, legs, modifying, the, female, s, web, mating, while, the, female, is, feeding, or, providing, a, nuptial, gift, in, response, to, sexual, cannibalism, male, body, size, is, not, under, selection, due, to, cannibalism, in, all, spider, species, such, as, nephila, pilipes, but, is, more, prominently, selected, for, in, less, dimorphic, species, of, spiders, which, often, selects, for, larger, male, size, in, the, species, maratus, volans, the, males, are, known, for, their, characteristic, colorful, fan, which, attracts, the, females, during, mating, ray, finned, fish, are, an, ancient, and, diverse, class, with, the, widest, degree, of, sexual, dimorphism, of, any, animal, class, fairbairn, notes, that, females, are, generally, larger, than, males, but, males, are, often, larger, in, species, with, male, male, combat, or, male, paternal, care, from, dwarf, males, to, males, more, than, 12, times, heavier, than, females, there, are, cases, where, males, are, substantially, larger, than, females, an, example, is, lamprologus, callipterus, a, type, of, cichlid, fish, in, this, fish, the, males, are, characterized, as, being, up, to, 60, times, larger, than, the, females, the, male, s, increased, size, is, believed, to, be, advantageous, because, males, collect, and, defend, empty, snail, shells, in, each, of, which, a, female, breeds, males, must, be, larger, and, more, powerful, in, order, to, collect, the, largest, shells, the, female, s, body, size, must, remain, small, because, in, order, for, her, to, breed, she, must, lay, her, eggs, inside, the, empty, shells, if, she, grows, too, large, she, will, not, fit, in, the, shells, and, will, be, unable, to, breed, the, female, s, small, body, size, is, also, likely, beneficial, to, her, chances, of, finding, an, unoccupied, shell, larger, shells, although, preferred, by, females, are, often, limited, in, availability, hence, the, female, is, limited, to, the, growth, of, the, size, of, the, shell, and, may, actually, change, her, growth, rate, according, to, shell, size, availability, in, other, words, the, male, s, ability, to, collect, large, shells, depends, on, his, size, the, larger, the, male, the, larger, the, shells, he, is, able, to, collect, this, then, allows, for, females, to, be, larger, in, his, brooding, nest, which, makes, the, difference, between, the, sizes, of, the, sexes, less, substantial, male, male, competition, in, this, fish, species, also, selects, for, large, size, in, males, there, is, aggressive, competition, by, males, over, territory, and, access, to, larger, shells, large, males, win, fights, and, steal, shells, from, competitors, another, example, is, the, dragonet, in, which, males, are, considerably, larger, than, females, and, possess, longer, fins, sexual, dimorphism, also, occurs, in, hermaphroditic, fish, these, species, are, known, as, sequential, hermaphrodites, in, fish, reproductive, histories, often, include, the, sex, change, from, female, to, male, where, there, is, a, strong, connection, between, growth, the, sex, of, an, individual, and, the, mating, system, within, which, it, operates, in, protogynous, mating, systems, where, males, dominate, mating, with, many, females, size, plays, a, significant, role, in, male, reproductive, success, males, have, a, propensity, to, be, larger, than, females, of, a, comparable, age, but, it, is, unclear, whether, the, size, increase, is, due, to, a, growth, spurt, at, the, time, of, the, sexual, transition, or, due, to, the, history, of, faster, growth, in, sex, changing, individuals, larger, males, are, able, to, stifle, the, growth, of, females, and, control, environmental, resources, social, organization, plays, a, large, role, in, the, changing, of, sex, by, the, fish, it, is, often, seen, that, a, fish, will, change, its, sex, when, there, is, a, lack, of, a, dominant, male, within, the, social, hierarchy, the, females, that, change, sex, are, often, those, who, attain, and, preserve, an, initial, size, advantage, early, in, life, in, either, case, females, which, change, sex, to, males, are, larger, and, often, prove, to, be, a, good, example, of, dimorphism, in, other, cases, with, fish, males, will, go, through, noticeable, changes, in, body, size, and, females, will, go, through, morphological, changes, that, can, only, be, seen, inside, of, the, body, for, example, in, sockeye, salmon, males, develop, larger, body, size, at, maturity, including, an, increase, in, body, depth, hump, height, and, snout, length, females, experience, minor, changes, in, snout, length, but, the, most, noticeable, difference, is, the, huge, increase, in, gonad, size, which, accounts, for, about, 25, of, body, mass, sexual, selection, was, observed, for, female, ornamentation, in, gobiusculus, flavescens, known, as, two, spotted, gobies, traditional, hypotheses, suggest, that, male, male, competition, drives, selection, however, selection, for, ornamentation, within, this, species, suggests, that, showy, female, traits, can, be, selected, through, either, female, female, competition, or, male, mate, choice, since, carotenoid, based, ornamentation, suggests, mate, quality, female, two, spotted, guppies, that, develop, colorful, orange, bellies, during, breeding, season, are, considered, favorable, to, males, the, males, invest, heavily, in, offspring, during, incubation, which, leads, to, the, sexual, preference, in, colorful, females, due, to, higher, egg, quality, in, amphibians, and, reptiles, the, degree, of, sexual, dimorphism, varies, widely, among, taxonomic, groups, the, sexual, dimorphism, in, amphibians, and, reptiles, may, be, reflected, in, any, of, the, following, anatomy, relative, length, of, tail, relative, size, of, head, overall, size, as, in, many, species, of, vipers, and, lizards, coloration, as, in, many, amphibians, snakes, and, lizards, as, well, as, in, some, turtles, an, ornament, as, in, many, newts, and, lizards, the, presence, of, specific, sex, related, behaviour, is, common, to, many, lizards, and, vocal, qualities, which, are, frequently, observed, in, frogs, anole, lizards, show, prominent, size, dimorphism, with, males, typically, being, significantly, larger, than, females, for, instance, the, average, male, anolis, sagrei, was, 53, 4, mm, vs, 40, mm, in, females, different, sizes, of, the, heads, in, anoles, have, been, explained, by, differences, in, the, estrogen, pathway, the, sexual, dimorphism, in, lizards, is, generally, attributed, to, the, effects, of, sexual, selection, but, other, mechanisms, including, ecological, divergence, and, fecundity, selection, provide, alternative, explanations, the, development, of, color, dimorphism, in, lizards, is, induced, by, hormonal, changes, at, the, onset, of, sexual, maturity, as, seen, in, psamodromus, algirus, sceloporus, gadoviae, and, s, undulates, erythrocheilus, sexual, dimorphism, in, size, is, also, seen, in, frog, species, like, p, bibroni, i, male, painted, dragon, lizards, ctenophorus, pictus, are, brightly, conspicuous, in, their, breeding, coloration, but, male, colour, declines, with, aging, male, coloration, appears, to, reflect, innate, anti, oxidation, capacity, that, protects, against, oxidative, dna, damage, male, breeding, coloration, is, likely, an, indicator, to, females, of, the, underlying, level, of, oxidative, dna, damage, a, significant, component, of, aging, in, potential, mates, possible, mechanisms, have, been, proposed, to, explain, macroevolution, of, sexual, size, dimorphism, in, birds, these, include, sexual, selection, selection, for, fecundity, in, females, niche, divergence, between, the, sexes, and, allometry, but, their, relative, importance, is, still, not, fully, understood, sexual, dimorphism, in, birds, can, be, manifested, in, size, or, plumage, differences, between, the, sexes, sexual, size, dimorphism, varies, among, taxa, with, males, typically, being, larger, though, this, is, not, always, the, case, e, g, birds, of, prey, hummingbirds, and, some, species, of, flightless, birds, plumage, dimorphism, in, the, form, of, ornamentation, or, coloration, also, varies, though, males, are, typically, the, more, ornamented, or, brightly, colored, sex, such, differences, have, been, attributed, to, the, unequal, reproductive, contributions, of, the, sexes, this, difference, produces, a, stronger, female, choice, since, they, have, more, risk, in, producing, offspring, in, some, species, the, male, s, contribution, to, reproduction, ends, at, copulation, while, in, other, species, the, male, becomes, the, main, or, only, caregiver, plumage, polymorphisms, have, evolved, to, reflect, these, differences, and, other, measures, of, reproductive, fitness, such, as, body, condition, or, survival, the, male, phenotype, sends, signals, to, females, who, then, choose, the, fittest, available, male, sexual, dimorphism, is, a, product, of, both, genetics, and, environmental, factors, an, example, of, sexual, polymorphism, determined, by, environmental, conditions, exists, in, the, red, backed, fairywren, red, backed, fairywren, males, can, be, classified, into, three, categories, during, breeding, season, black, breeders, brown, breeders, and, brown, auxiliaries, these, differences, arise, in, response, to, the, bird, s, body, condition, if, they, are, healthy, they, will, produce, more, androgens, thus, becoming, black, breeders, while, less, healthy, birds, produce, less, androgens, and, become, brown, auxiliaries, the, reproductive, success, of, the, male, is, thus, determined, by, his, success, during, each, year, s, non, breeding, season, causing, reproductive, success, to, vary, with, each, year, s, environmental, conditions, migratory, patterns, and, behaviors, also, influence, sexual, dimorphisms, this, aspect, also, stems, back, to, size, dimorphism, in, species, it, has, been, shown, that, the, larger, males, are, better, at, coping, with, the, difficulties, of, migration, and, thus, are, more, successful, in, reproducing, when, reaching, the, breeding, destination, when, viewing, this, from, an, evolutionary, standpoint, many, theories, and, explanations, come, into, consideration, if, these, are, the, result, for, every, migration, and, breeding, season, the, expected, results, should, be, a, shift, towards, a, larger, male, population, through, sexual, selection, sexual, selection, is, strong, when, the, factor, of, environmental, selection, is, also, introduced, environmental, selection, may, support, a, smaller, chick, size, if, those, chicks, were, born, in, an, area, that, allowed, them, to, grow, to, a, larger, size, even, though, under, normal, conditions, they, would, not, be, able, to, reach, this, optimal, size, for, migration, when, the, environment, gives, advantages, and, disadvantages, of, this, sort, the, strength, of, selection, is, weakened, and, the, environmental, forces, are, given, greater, morphological, weight, the, sexual, dimorphism, could, also, produce, a, change, in, timing, of, migration, leading, to, differences, in, mating, success, within, the, bird, population, when, the, dimorphism, produces, that, large, of, a, variation, between, the, sexes, and, between, the, members, of, the, sexes, multiple, evolutionary, effects, can, take, place, this, timing, could, even, lead, to, a, speciation, phenomenon, if, the, variation, becomes, strongly, drastic, and, favorable, towards, two, different, outcomes, sexual, dimorphism, is, maintained, by, the, counteracting, pressures, of, natural, selection, and, sexual, selection, for, example, sexual, dimorphism, in, coloration, increases, the, vulnerability, of, bird, species, to, predation, by, european, sparrowhawks, in, denmark, presumably, increased, sexual, dimorphism, means, males, are, brighter, and, more, conspicuous, leading, to, increased, predation, moreover, the, production, of, more, exaggerated, ornaments, in, males, may, come, at, the, cost, of, suppressed, immune, function, so, long, as, the, reproductive, benefits, of, the, trait, due, to, sexual, selection, are, greater, than, the, costs, imposed, by, natural, selection, then, the, trait, will, propagate, throughout, the, population, reproductive, benefits, arise, in, the, form, of, a, larger, number, of, offspring, while, natural, selection, imposes, costs, in, the, form, of, reduced, survival, this, means, that, even, if, the, trait, causes, males, to, die, earlier, the, trait, is, still, beneficial, so, long, as, males, with, the, trait, produce, more, offspring, than, males, lacking, the, trait, this, balance, keeps, dimorphism, alive, in, these, species, and, ensures, that, the, next, generation, of, successful, males, will, also, display, these, traits, that, are, attractive, to, females, such, differences, in, form, and, reproductive, roles, often, cause, differences, in, behavior, as, previously, stated, males, and, females, often, have, different, roles, in, reproduction, the, courtship, and, mating, behavior, of, males, and, females, are, regulated, largely, by, hormones, throughout, a, bird, s, lifetime, activational, hormones, occur, during, puberty, and, adulthood, and, serve, to, activate, certain, behaviors, when, appropriate, such, as, territoriality, during, breeding, season, organizational, hormones, occur, only, during, a, critical, period, early, in, development, either, just, before, or, just, after, hatching, in, most, birds, and, determine, patterns, of, behavior, for, the, rest, of, the, bird, s, life, such, behavioral, differences, can, cause, disproportionate, sensitivities, to, anthropogenic, pressures, females, of, the, whinchat, in, switzerland, breed, in, intensely, managed, grasslands, earlier, harvesting, of, the, grasses, during, the, breeding, season, lead, to, more, female, deaths, populations, of, many, birds, are, often, male, skewed, and, when, sexual, differences, in, behavior, increase, this, ratio, populations, decline, at, a, more, rapid, rate, also, not, all, male, dimorphic, traits, are, due, to, hormones, like, testosterone, instead, they, are, a, naturally, occurring, part, of, development, for, example, plumage, in, addition, the, strong, hormonal, influence, on, phenotypic, differences, suggests, that, the, genetic, mechanism, and, genetic, basis, of, these, sexually, dimorphic, traits, may, involve, transcription, factors, or, cofactors, rather, than, regulatory, sequences, sexual, dimorphism, may, also, influence, differences, in, parental, investment, during, times, of, food, scarcity, for, example, in, the, blue, footed, booby, the, female, chicks, grow, faster, than, the, males, resulting, in, booby, parents, producing, the, smaller, sex, the, males, during, times, of, food, shortage, this, then, results, in, the, maximization, of, parental, lifetime, reproductive, success, in, black, tailed, godwits, limosa, limosa, limosa, females, are, also, the, larger, sex, and, the, growth, rates, of, female, chicks, are, more, susceptible, to, limited, environmental, conditions, sexual, dimorphism, may, also, only, appear, during, mating, season, some, species, of, birds, only, show, dimorphic, traits, in, seasonal, variation, the, males, of, these, species, will, molt, into, a, less, bright, or, less, exaggerated, color, during, the, off, breeding, season, this, occurs, because, the, species, is, more, focused, on, survival, than, on, reproduction, causing, a, shift, into, a, less, ornate, state, consequently, sexual, dimorphism, has, important, ramifications, for, conservation, however, sexual, dimorphism, is, not, only, found, in, birds, and, is, thus, important, to, the, conservation, of, many, animals, such, differences, in, form, and, behavior, can, lead, to, sexual, segregation, defined, as, sex, differences, in, space, and, resource, use, most, sexual, segregation, research, has, been, done, on, ungulates, but, such, research, extends, to, bats, kangaroos, and, birds, sex, specific, conservation, plans, have, even, been, suggested, for, species, with, pronounced, sexual, segregation, the, term, sesquimorphism, the, latin, numeral, prefix, sesqui, means, one, and, one, half, so, halfway, between, mono, one, and, di, two, has, been, proposed, for, bird, species, in, which, both, sexes, have, basically, the, same, plumage, pattern, though, the, female, is, clearly, distinguishable, by, reason, of, her, paler, or, washed, out, colour, 14, examples, include, cape, sparrow, passer, melanurus, 67, rufous, sparrow, subspecies, p, motinensis, motinensis, 80, and, saxaul, sparrow, p, ammodendri, 245, examining, fossils, of, non, avian, dinosaurs, in, search, of, sexually, dimorphic, characteristics, requires, the, supply, of, complete, and, articulated, skeletal, and, tissue, remains, as, terrestrial, organisms, dinosaur, carcasses, are, subject, to, ecological, and, geographical, influence, that, inevitably, constitutes, the, degree, of, preservation, the, availability, of, well, preserved, remains, is, not, a, probable, outcome, as, a, consequence, of, decomposition, and, fossilization, some, paleontologists, have, looked, for, sexual, dimorphism, among, dinosaurs, using, statistics, and, comparison, to, ecologically, or, phylogenetically, related, modern, animals, apatosaurus, and, diplodocus, female, apatosaurus, and, diplodocus, had, interconnected, caudal, vertebrae, that, allowed, them, to, keep, their, tails, elevated, to, aid, in, copulation, discovering, that, this, fusion, occurred, in, only, 50, of, apatosaurus, and, diplodocus, skeletons, and, 25, of, camarasaurus, skeletons, indicated, that, this, is, a, sexually, dimorphic, trait, theropoda, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, male, theropods, possessed, a, retractable, penis, a, feature, similar, to, modern, day, crocodilians, crocodilian, skeletons, were, examined, to, determine, whether, there, is, a, skeletal, component, that, is, distinctive, between, both, sexes, to, help, provide, an, insight, on, the, physical, disparities, between, male, and, female, theropods, findings, revealed, the, caudal, chevrons, of, male, crocodiles, used, to, anchor, the, penis, muscles, were, significantly, larger, than, those, of, females, there, have, been, criticisms, of, these, findings, but, it, remains, a, subject, of, debate, among, advocates, and, adversaries, ornithopoda, studies, of, sexual, dimorphism, in, hadrosaurs, have, generally, centered, on, the, distinctive, cranial, crests, which, likely, provided, a, function, in, sexual, display, a, biometric, study, of, 36, skulls, found, sexual, dimorphism, was, exhibited, in, the, crest, of, 3, species, of, hadrosaurids, the, crests, could, be, categorized, as, full, male, or, narrow, female, and, may, have, given, some, advantage, in, intrasexual, mating, competition, ceratopsians, according, to, scott, d, sampson, if, ceratopsids, were, to, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, modern, ecological, analogues, suggest, it, would, be, found, in, display, structures, such, as, horns, and, frills, no, convincing, evidence, for, sexual, dimorphism, in, body, size, or, mating, signals, is, known, in, ceratopsids, although, there, is, evidence, that, the, more, primitive, ceratopsian, protoceratops, andrewsi, possessed, sexes, that, were, distinguishable, based, on, frill, and, nasal, prominence, size, this, is, consistent, with, other, known, tetrapod, groups, where, midsized, animals, tend, to, exhibit, markedly, more, sexual, dimorphism, than, larger, ones, however, it, has, been, proposed, that, these, differences, can, be, better, explained, by, intraspecific, and, ontogenic, variation, rather, than, sexual, dimorphism, in, addition, many, sexually, dimorphic, traits, that, may, have, existed, in, ceratopsians, include, soft, tissue, variations, such, as, coloration, or, dewlaps, which, would, be, unlikely, to, have, been, preserved, in, the, fossil, record, stegosaurians, a, 2015, study, on, specimens, of, hesperosaurus, mjosi, found, evidence, of, sexual, dimorphism, in, the, shape, of, the, dermal, plates, two, plate, morphs, were, described, one, was, short, wide, and, oval, shaped, the, other, taller, and, narrower, in, a, large, proportion, of, mammal, species, males, are, larger, than, females, both, genes, and, hormones, affect, the, formation, of, many, animal, brains, before, birth, or, hatching, and, also, behaviour, of, adult, individuals, hormones, significantly, affect, human, brain, formation, and, also, brain, development, at, puberty, a, 2004, review, in, nature, reviews, neuroscience, observed, that, because, it, is, easier, to, manipulate, hormone, levels, than, the, expression, of, sex, chromosome, genes, the, effects, of, hormones, have, been, studied, much, more, extensively, and, are, much, better, understood, than, the, direct, actions, in, the, brain, of, sex, chromosome, genes, it, concluded, that, while, the, differentiating, effects, of, gonadal, secretions, seem, to, be, dominant, the, existing, body, of, research, support, the, idea, that, sex, differences, in, neural, expression, of, x, and, y, genes, significantly, contribute, to, sex, differences, in, brain, functions, and, disease, marine, mammals, show, some, of, the, greatest, sexual, size, differences, of, mammals, because, of, sexual, selection, and, environmental, factors, like, breeding, location, the, mating, system, of, pinnipeds, varies, from, polygamy, to, serial, monogamy, pinnipeds, are, known, for, early, differential, growth, and, maternal, investment, since, the, only, nutrients, for, newborn, pups, is, the, milk, provided, by, the, mother, for, example, the, males, are, significantly, larger, about, 10, heavier, and, 2, longer, than, the, females, at, birth, in, sea, lion, pups, the, pattern, of, differential, investment, can, be, varied, principally, prenatally, and, post, natally, mirounga, leonina, the, southern, elephant, seal, is, one, of, the, most, dimorphic, mammals, top, stylised, illustration, of, humans, on, the, pioneer, plaque, showing, both, male, left, and, female, right, bottom, comparison, between, male, left, and, female, right, pelvises, according, to, clark, spencer, larsen, modern, day, homo, sapiens, show, a, range, of, sexual, dimorphism, with, average, body, mass, between, the, sexes, differing, by, roughly, 15, substantial, discussion, in, academic, literature, considers, potential, evolutionary, advantages, associated, with, sexual, competition, both, intrasexual, and, intersexual, as, well, as, short, and, long, term, sexual, strategies, according, to, daly, and, wilson, the, sexes, differ, more, in, human, beings, than, in, monogamous, mammals, but, much, less, than, in, extremely, polygamous, mammals, the, average, basal, metabolic, rate, is, about, 6, percent, higher, in, adolescent, males, than, females, and, increases, to, about, 10, percent, higher, after, puberty, females, tend, to, convert, more, food, into, fat, while, males, convert, more, into, muscle, and, expendable, circulating, energy, reserves, according, to, tim, hewett, director, of, research, in, the, department, of, sports, medicine, at, ohio, state, university, wexner, medical, center, females, have, on, average, 50, 60, of, the, upper, body, strength, of, males, and, 80, 90, of, the, lower, body, strength, of, males, relative, to, body, size, but, females, have, higher, endurance, than, males, the, difference, in, strength, relative, to, body, mass, is, less, pronounced, in, trained, individuals, in, olympic, weightlifting, male, records, vary, from, 5, 5, body, mass, in, the, lowest, weight, category, to, 4, 2, in, the, highest, weight, category, while, female, records, vary, from, 4, 4, to, 3, 8, a, weight, adjusted, difference, of, only, 10, 20, and, an, absolute, difference, of, about, 30, i, e, 492, kg, vs, 348, kg, for, unlimited, weight, classes, see, olympic, weightlifting, records, a, study, carried, out, by, analyzing, annual, world, rankings, from, 1980, to, 1996, found, that, males, running, times, were, on, average, 10, faster, than, females, in, early, adolescence, females, are, on, average, taller, than, males, as, females, tend, to, go, through, puberty, earlier, but, males, on, average, surpass, them, in, height, in, later, adolescence, and, adulthood, in, the, united, states, adult, males, are, on, average, 9, taller, and, 16, 5, heavier, than, adult, females, males, typically, have, larger, tracheae, and, branching, bronchi, with, about, 30, percent, greater, lung, volume, per, body, mass, on, average, males, have, larger, hearts, 10, percent, higher, red, blood, cell, count, higher, hemoglobin, hence, greater, oxygen, carrying, capacity, they, also, have, higher, circulating, clotting, factors, vitamin, k, pro, thrombin, and, platelets, these, differences, lead, to, faster, healing, of, wounds, and, lower, sensitivity, to, nerve, pain, after, injury, in, males, pain, causing, injury, to, the, peripheral, nerve, occurs, through, the, microglia, while, in, females, it, occurs, through, the, t, cells, except, in, pregnant, women, who, follow, a, male, pattern, females, typically, have, more, white, blood, cells, stored, and, circulating, as, well, as, more, granulocytes, and, b, and, t, lymphocytes, additionally, they, produce, more, antibodies, at, a, faster, rate, than, males, hence, they, develop, fewer, infectious, diseases, and, succumb, for, shorter, periods, ethologists, argue, that, females, interacting, with, other, females, and, multiple, offspring, in, social, groups, have, experienced, such, traits, as, a, selective, advantage, females, have, a, higher, sensitivity, to, pain, due, to, aforementioned, nerve, differences, that, increase, the, sensation, and, females, thus, require, higher, levels, of, pain, medication, after, injury, hormonal, changes, in, females, affect, pain, sensitivity, and, pregnant, women, have, the, same, sensitivity, as, males, acute, pain, tolerance, is, also, more, consistent, over, a, lifetime, in, females, than, males, despite, these, hormonal, changes, despite, differences, in, physical, feeling, both, sexes, have, similar, psychological, tolerance, to, or, ability, to, cope, with, and, ignore, pain, in, the, human, brain, a, difference, between, sexes, was, observed, in, the, transcription, of, the, pcdh11x, y, gene, pair, unique, to, homo, sapiens, sexual, differentiation, in, the, human, brain, from, the, undifferentiated, state, is, triggered, by, testosterone, from, the, fetal, testis, testosterone, is, converted, to, estrogen, in, the, brain, through, the, action, of, the, enzyme, aromatase, testosterone, acts, on, many, brain, areas, including, the, sdn, poa, to, create, the, masculinized, brain, pattern, the, brains, of, pregnant, females, carrying, male, fetuses, may, be, shielded, from, the, masculinizing, effects, of, androgen, through, the, action, of, sex, hormone, binding, globulin, the, relationship, between, sex, differences, in, the, brain, and, human, behavior, is, a, subject, of, controversy, in, psychology, and, society, at, large, many, females, tend, to, have, a, higher, ratio, of, gray, matter, in, the, left, hemisphere, of, the, brain, in, comparison, to, males, males, on, average, have, larger, brains, than, females, however, when, adjusted, for, total, brain, volume, the, gray, matter, differences, between, sexes, are, almost, nonexistent, thus, the, percentage, of, gray, matter, appears, to, be, more, related, to, brain, size, than, it, is, to, sex, differences, in, brain, physiology, between, sexes, do, not, necessarily, relate, to, differences, in, intellect, haier, et, al, found, in, a, 2004, study, that, men, and, women, apparently, achieve, similar, iq, results, with, different, brain, regions, suggesting, that, there, is, no, singular, underlying, neuroanatomical, structure, to, general, intelligence, and, that, different, types, of, brain, designs, may, manifest, equivalent, intellectual, performance, see, the, sex, and, intelligence, article, for, more, on, this, subject, strict, graph, theoretical, analysis, of, the, human, brain, connections, revealed, that, in, numerous, graph, theoretical, parameters, e, g, minimum, bipartition, width, edge, number, the, expander, graph, property, minimum, vertex, cover, the, structural, connectome, of, women, are, significantly, better, connected, than, the, connectome, of, men, it, was, shown, that, the, graph, theoretical, differences, are, due, to, the, sex, and, not, to, the, differences, in, the, cerebral, volume, by, analyzing, the, data, of, 36, females, and, 36, males, where, the, brain, volume, of, each, man, in, the, group, was, smaller, than, the, brain, volume, of, each, woman, in, the, group, sexual, dimorphism, was, also, described, in, the, gene, level, and, shown, to, extend, from, the, sex, chromosomes, overall, about, 6500, genes, have, been, found, to, have, sex, differential, expression, in, at, least, one, tissue, many, of, these, genes, are, not, directly, associated, with, reproduction, but, rather, linked, to, more, general, biological, features, in, addition, it, has, been, shown, that, genes, with, sex, specific, expression, undergo, reduced, selection, efficiency, which, leads, to, higher, population, frequencies, of, deleterious, mutations, and, contributes, to, the, prevalence, of, several, human, diseases, sexual, dimorphism, in, immune, function, is, a, common, pattern, in, vertebrates, and, also, in, a, number, of, invertebrates, most, often, females, are, more, immunocompetent, than, males, this, trait, is, not, consistent, among, all, animals, but, differs, depending, on, taxonomy, with, the, most, female, biased, immune, systems, being, found, in, insects, in, mammals, this, results, in, more, frequent, and, severe, infections, in, males, and, higher, rates, of, autoimmune, disorders, in, females, one, potential, cause, may, be, differences, in, gene, expression, of, immune, cells, between, the, sexes, another, explanation, is, that, endocrinological, differences, between, the, sexes, impact, the, immune, system, for, example, testosterone, acts, as, an, immunosuppressive, agent, phenotypic, differences, between, sexes, are, evident, even, in, cultured, cells, from, tissues, for, example, female, muscle, derived, stem, cells, have, a, better, muscle, regeneration, efficiency, than, male, ones, there, are, reports, of, several, metabolic, differences, between, male, and, female, cells, and, they, also, respond, to, stress, differently, in, theory, larger, females, are, favored, by, competition, for, mates, especially, in, polygamous, species, larger, females, offer, an, advantage, in, fertility, since, the, physiological, demands, of, reproduction, are, limiting, in, females, hence, there, is, a, theoretical, expectation, that, females, tend, to, be, larger, in, species, that, are, monogamous, females, are, larger, in, many, species, of, insects, many, spiders, many, fish, many, reptiles, owls, birds, of, prey, and, certain, mammals, such, as, the, spotted, hyena, and, baleen, whales, such, as, blue, whale, as, an, example, in, some, species, females, are, sedentary, and, so, males, must, search, for, them, fritz, vollrath, and, geoff, parker, argue, that, this, difference, in, behaviour, leads, to, radically, different, selection, pressures, on, the, two, sexes, evidently, favouring, smaller, males, cases, where, the, male, is, larger, than, the, female, have, been, studied, as, well, and, require, alternative, explanations, one, example, of, this, type, of, sexual, size, dimorphism, is, the, bat, myotis, nigricans, black, myotis, bat, where, females, are, substantially, larger, than, males, in, terms, of, body, weight, skull, measurement, and, forearm, length, the, interaction, between, the, sexes, and, the, energy, needed, to, produce, viable, offspring, makes, it, favorable, for, females, to, be, larger, in, this, species, females, bear, the, energetic, cost, of, producing, eggs, which, is, much, greater, than, the, cost, of, making, sperm, by, the, males, the, fecundity, advantage, hypothesis, states, that, a, larger, female, is, able, to, produce, more, offspring, and, give, them, more, favorable, conditions, to, ensure, their, survival, this, is, true, for, most, ectotherms, a, larger, female, can, provide, parental, care, for, a, longer, time, while, the, offspring, matures, the, gestation, and, lactation, periods, are, fairly, long, in, m, nigricans, the, females, suckling, their, offspring, until, they, reach, nearly, adult, size, they, would, not, be, able, to, fly, and, catch, prey, if, they, did, not, compensate, for, the, additional, mass, of, the, offspring, during, this, time, smaller, male, size, may, be, an, adaptation, to, increase, maneuverability, and, agility, allowing, males, to, compete, better, with, females, for, food, and, other, resources, some, species, of, anglerfish, also, display, extreme, sexual, dimorphism, females, are, more, typical, in, appearance, to, other, fish, whereas, males, are, tiny, rudimentary, creatures, with, stunted, digestive, systems, a, male, must, find, a, female, and, fuse, with, her, he, then, lives, parasitically, becoming, little, more, than, a, sperm, producing, body, in, what, amounts, to, an, effectively, hermaphrodite, composite, organism, a, similar, situation, is, found, in, the, zeus, water, bug, phoreticovelia, disparata, where, the, female, has, a, glandular, area, on, her, back, that, can, serve, to, feed, a, male, which, clings, to, her, although, males, can, survive, away, from, females, they, generally, are, not, free, living, this, is, taken, to, the, logical, extreme, in, the, rhizocephala, crustaceans, like, the, sacculina, where, the, male, injects, itself, into, the, female, s, body, and, becomes, nothing, more, than, sperm, producing, cells, to, the, point, that, the, superorder, used, to, be, mistaken, for, hermaphroditic, some, plant, species, also, exhibit, dimorphism, in, which, the, females, are, significantly, larger, than, the, males, such, as, in, the, moss, dicranum, and, the, liverwort, sphaerocarpos, there, is, some, evidence, that, in, these, genera, the, dimorphism, may, be, tied, to, a, sex, chromosome, or, to, chemical, signalling, from, females, another, complicated, example, of, sexual, dimorphism, is, in, vespula, squamosa, the, southern, yellowjacket, in, this, wasp, species, the, female, workers, are, the, smallest, the, male, workers, are, slightly, larger, and, the, female, queens, are, significantly, larger, than, her, female, workers, and, male, counterparts, in, 1871, charles, darwin, advanced, the, theory, of, sexual, selection, which, related, sexual, dimorphism, to, sexual, selection, the, first, step, towards, sexual, dimorphism, is, the, size, differentiation, of, sperm, and, eggs, anisogamy, 917, anisogamy, and, the, usually, large, number, of, small, male, gametes, relative, to, the, larger, female, gametes, usually, lies, in, the, development, of, strong, sperm, competition, because, small, sperm, enable, organisms, to, produce, a, large, number, of, sperm, and, make, males, or, male, function, of, hermaphrodites, more, redundant, volvocine, algae, have, been, useful, in, understanding, the, evolution, of, sexual, dimorphism, and, species, like, the, beetle, c, maculatus, where, the, females, are, larger, than, the, males, are, used, to, study, its, underlying, genetic, mechanisms, in, many, non, monogamous, species, the, benefit, to, a, male, s, reproductive, fitness, of, mating, with, multiple, females, is, large, whereas, the, benefit, to, a, female, s, reproductive, fitness, of, mating, with, multiple, males, is, small, or, nonexistent, in, these, species, there, is, a, selection, pressure, for, whatever, traits, enable, a, male, to, have, more, matings, the, male, may, therefore, come, to, have, different, traits, from, the, female, these, traits, could, be, ones, that, allow, him, to, fight, off, other, males, for, control, of, territory, or, a, harem, such, as, large, size, or, weapons, or, they, could, be, traits, that, females, for, whatever, reason, prefer, in, mates, male, male, competition, poses, no, deep, theoretical, questions, but, mate, choice, does, females, may, choose, males, that, appear, strong, and, healthy, thus, likely, to, possess, good, alleles, and, give, rise, to, healthy, offspring, in, some, species, however, females, seem, to, choose, males, with, traits, that, do, not, improve, offspring, survival, rates, and, even, traits, that, reduce, it, potentially, leading, to, traits, like, the, peacock, s, tail, two, hypotheses, for, explaining, this, fact, are, the, sexy, son, hypothesis, and, the, handicap, principle, the, sexy, son, hypothesis, states, that, females, may, initially, choose, a, trait, because, it, improves, the, survival, of, their, young, but, once, this, preference, has, become, widespread, females, must, continue, to, choose, the, trait, even, if, it, becomes, harmful, those, that, do, not, will, have, sons, that, are, unattractive, to, most, females, since, the, preference, is, widespread, and, so, receive, few, matings, the, handicap, principle, states, that, a, male, who, survives, despite, possessing, some, sort, of, handicap, thus, proves, that, the, rest, of, his, genes, are, good, alleles, if, males, with, bad, alleles, could, not, survive, the, handicap, females, may, evolve, to, choose, males, with, this, sort, of, handicap, the, trait, is, acting, as, a, hard, to, fake, signal, of, fitness
