a, weed, is, a, plant, considered, undesirable, in, a, particular, situation, growing, where, it, conflicts, with, human, preferences, needs, or, goals, plants, with, characteristics, that, make, them, hazardous, aesthetically, unappealing, difficult, to, control, in, managed, environments, or, otherwise, unwanted, in, farm, land, orchards, gardens, lawns, parks, recreational, spaces, residential, and, industrial, areas, may, all, be, considered, weeds, the, concept, of, weeds, is, particularly, significant, in, agriculture, where, the, presence, of, weeds, in, fields, used, to, grow, crops, may, cause, major, losses, in, yields, invasive, species, plants, introduced, to, an, environment, where, their, presence, negatively, impacts, the, overall, functioning, and, biodiversity, of, the, ecosystem, may, also, sometimes, be, considered, weeds, taxonomically, the, term, weed, has, no, botanical, significance, because, a, plant, that, is, a, weed, in, one, context, is, not, a, weed, when, growing, in, a, situation, where, it, is, wanted, some, plants, that, are, widely, regarded, as, weeds, are, intentionally, grown, in, gardens, and, other, cultivated, settings, for, this, reason, some, plants, are, sometimes, called, beneficial, weeds, similarly, volunteer, plants, from, a, previous, crop, are, regarded, as, weeds, when, growing, in, a, subsequent, crop, thus, alternative, nomenclature, for, the, same, plants, might, be, hardy, pioneers, cosmopolitan, species, volunteers, spontaneous, urban, vegetation, etc, although, whether, a, plant, is, a, weed, depends, on, context, plants, commonly, defined, as, weeds, broadly, share, biological, characteristics, that, allow, them, to, thrive, in, disturbed, environments, and, to, be, particularly, difficult, to, destroy, or, eradicate, in, particular, weeds, are, adapted, to, thrive, under, human, management, in, the, same, way, as, intentionally, grown, plants, since, the, origins, of, agriculture, on, earth, agricultural, weeds, have, co, evolved, with, human, crops, and, agricultural, systems, and, some, have, been, domesticated, into, crops, themselves, after, their, fitness, in, agricultural, settings, became, apparent, more, broadly, the, term, weed, is, occasionally, applied, pejoratively, to, species, outside, the, plant, kingdom, species, that, can, survive, in, diverse, environments, and, reproduce, quickly, in, this, sense, it, has, even, been, applied, to, humans, weed, control, is, important, in, agriculture, and, horticulture, methods, include, hand, cultivation, with, hoes, powered, cultivation, with, cultivators, smothering, with, mulch, or, soil, solarization, lethal, wilting, with, high, heat, burning, or, chemical, attack, with, herbicides, and, cultural, methods, such, as, crop, rotation, and, fallowing, land, to, reduce, the, weed, population, it, has, long, been, assumed, that, weeds, in, the, sense, of, rapidly, evolving, plants, taking, advantage, of, human, disturbed, environments, evolved, in, response, to, the, neolithic, agricultural, revolution, approximately, 12, 000, years, ago, however, researchers, have, found, evidence, of, proto, weeds, behaving, in, similar, ways, at, ohalo, ii, a, 23, 000, year, old, archeological, site, in, israel, the, idea, of, weeds, as, a, category, of, undesirable, plant, has, not, been, universal, throughout, history, before, 1200, a, d, little, evidence, exists, of, concern, with, weed, control, or, of, agricultural, practices, solely, intended, to, control, weeds, a, possible, reason, for, this, is, that, for, much, of, human, history, women, and, children, were, an, abundant, source, of, cheap, labor, to, control, weeds, and, not, directly, acknowledged, weeds, are, assumed, to, have, existed, since, the, beginning, of, agriculture, and, accepted, as, an, inevitable, nuisance, though, the, plants, are, not, named, using, a, specific, term, denoting, a, weed, in, the, contemporary, sense, plants, that, may, be, interpreted, as, weeds, are, referenced, in, the, bible, cursed, is, the, ground, because, of, you, through, painful, toil, you, will, eat, of, it, all, the, days, of, your, life, it, will, produce, thorns, and, thistles, for, you, and, you, will, eat, the, plants, of, the, field, by, the, sweat, of, your, brow, you, will, eat, your, food, until, you, return, to, the, ground, some, early, roman, writers, referenced, weeding, activities, in, agricultural, fields, but, weed, control, in, the, pre, modern, era, was, probably, an, incidental, effect, of, plowing, ancient, egyptians, assyrians, and, sumerians, had, no, specific, word, for, weeds, seeing, all, plants, as, having, some, use, the, english, word, weed, can, be, traced, back, to, the, old, english, weod, which, refers, to, woad, rather, than, a, category, of, plant, as, in, the, modern, usage, in, early, medieval, european, herbals, each, plant, is, regarded, as, having, its, own, virtues, by, the, sixteenth, century, the, concept, of, a, weed, was, better, defined, as, a, noxious, or, undesirable, type, of, plant, as, referenced, metaphorically, in, william, shakespeare, s, works, an, example, of, a, shakespearean, reference, to, weeds, is, found, in, sonnet, 69, to, thy, fair, flower, add, the, rank, smell, of, weeds, but, why, thy, odour, matcheth, not, thy, show, the, soil, is, this, that, thou, dost, common, grow, in, london, during, this, period, poor, women, were, paid, low, wages, to, weed, gardens, and, courtyards, after, the, reformation, christian, theology, that, emphasized, the, degradation, of, nature, after, the, fall, of, man, and, humankind, s, role, and, duty, to, dominate, and, subdue, nature, became, more, developed, and, widespread, various, european, writers, designated, certain, plants, as, vermin, and, filth, though, many, plants, identified, as, such, were, valued, by, gardeners, or, by, herbalists, and, apothecaries, and, some, questioned, the, idea, that, any, plant, could, be, without, purpose, or, value, laws, mandating, the, control, of, weeds, emerged, as, early, as, the, seventeenth, century, in, 1691, a, law, in, new, york, required, the, removal, of, poysonous, and, stincking, weeds, in, front, of, houses, in, the, nineteenth, century, manual, labor, was, used, to, control, weeds, in, european, towns, and, cities, and, chemical, methods, of, weed, control, emerged, for, example, a, french, journal, in, 1831, documented, a, mixture, of, sulfur, lime, and, water, boiled, in, an, iron, cauldron, as, an, effective, herbicide, to, prevent, grass, from, growing, among, cobblestones, the, cultural, association, between, weeds, and, moral, or, spiritual, degradation, persisted, into, the, last, nineteenth, century, in, american, cities, urban, expansion, and, development, created, ideal, habitats, for, weeds, in, nineteenth, century, america, reformers, consequently, saw, weeds, as, a, part, of, the, larger, problem, of, filth, disease, and, moral, corruption, that, plagued, the, urban, environments, and, weeds, were, seen, as, refuge, for, tramps, and, other, criminal, or, undesirable, people, the, st, louis, post, dispatch, credited, weeds, as, causing, diphtheria, scarlet, fever, and, typhoid, in, st, louis, between, the, years, of, 1905, 1910, weeds, became, viewed, as, a, major, public, health, hazard, believed, to, cause, typhoid, and, malaria, and, legal, precedents, were, set, in, order, to, control, weeds, that, would, help, facilitate, the, adoption, of, weed, control, laws, throughout, the, country, weed, as, a, category, of, plant, overlaps, with, the, closely, related, concepts, of, ruderal, and, pioneer, species, pioneer, species, are, specifically, adapted, to, disturbed, environments, where, the, existing, plant, and, soil, community, has, been, disrupted, or, damaged, in, some, way, adaptation, to, disturbance, can, give, weeds, advantages, over, desirable, crops, pastures, or, ornamental, plants, the, nature, of, the, habitat, and, its, disturbances, will, affect, or, even, determine, which, types, of, weed, communities, become, dominant, in, weed, ecology, some, authorities, speak, of, the, relationship, between, the, three, ps, plant, place, perception, these, have, been, very, variously, defined, but, the, weed, traits, listed, by, h, g, baker, are, widely, cited, examples, of, such, ruderal, or, pioneer, species, include, plants, that, are, adapted, to, naturally, occurring, disturbed, environments, such, as, dunes, and, other, windswept, areas, with, shifting, soils, alluvial, flood, plains, river, banks, and, deltas, and, areas, that, are, burned, repeatedly, since, human, agricultural, and, horticultural, practices, often, mimic, these, natural, disturbances, that, weedy, species, have, adapted, for, some, weeds, are, effectively, preadapted, to, grow, and, proliferate, in, human, disturbed, areas, such, as, agricultural, fields, lawns, gardens, roadsides, and, construction, sites, as, agricultural, practices, continue, and, develop, weeds, evolve, further, with, humans, exerting, evolutionary, pressure, upon, weeds, through, manipulating, their, habitat, and, attempting, to, control, weed, populations, due, to, their, ability, to, survive, and, thrive, in, conditions, challenging, or, hostile, to, other, plants, weeds, have, been, considered, extremophiles, due, to, their, evolutionary, heritage, as, disturbance, adapted, pioneers, most, weeds, exhibit, incredibly, high, phenotype, plasticity, meaning, that, individual, plants, hold, the, potential, to, adapt, their, morphology, growth, and, appearance, in, response, to, their, conditions, the, potential, within, a, single, individual, to, adapt, to, a, wide, variety, of, conditions, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, an, all, purpose, genotype, disturbance, adapted, plants, typically, grow, rapidly, and, reproduce, quickly, with, some, annual, weeds, having, multiple, generations, in, a, single, growing, season, they, commonly, have, seeds, that, persist, in, the, soil, seed, bank, for, many, years, perennial, weeds, often, have, underground, stems, that, spread, under, the, soil, surface, or, like, ground, ivy, glechoma, hederacea, have, creeping, stems, that, root, and, spread, out, over, the, ground, these, traits, make, many, disturbance, adapted, plants, highly, successful, as, weeds, on, top, of, the, ability, of, individual, plants, to, adapt, to, their, conditions, weed, populations, also, evolve, much, more, quickly, than, older, models, of, evolution, account, for, once, established, in, an, agricultural, setting, weeds, have, been, observed, to, undergo, evolutionary, changes, to, adapt, to, selective, pressures, imposed, by, human, management, some, examples, include, changes, in, seed, dormancy, changes, in, seasonal, life, cycles, changes, in, plant, morphology, and, the, evolution, of, resistance, to, herbicides, rapid, life, cycles, large, populations, and, ability, to, spread, large, numbers, of, seeds, long, distances, also, allow, weed, species, with, these, general, characteristics, to, evolve, quickly, the, concept, of, weeds, also, overlaps, with, the, concept, of, invasive, species, both, in, the, sense, that, human, activities, tend, to, introduce, weeds, outside, their, native, range, and, that, an, introduced, species, may, be, considered, a, weed, many, weed, species, have, moved, out, of, their, natural, geographic, ranges, and, spread, around, the, world, in, tandem, with, human, migrations, and, commerce, weed, seeds, are, often, collected, and, transported, with, crops, after, the, harvesting, of, grains, so, humans, are, a, vector, of, transport, as, well, as, a, producer, of, the, disturbed, environments, to, which, weed, species, are, well, adapted, resulting, in, many, weeds, having, a, close, association, with, human, activities, some, plants, become, dominant, when, introduced, into, new, environments, because, the, animals, and, plants, in, their, original, environment, that, compete, with, them, or, feed, on, them, are, absent, in, what, is, sometimes, called, the, natural, enemies, hypothesis, plants, freed, from, these, specialist, consumers, may, become, dominant, an, example, is, klamath, weed, which, threatened, millions, of, hectares, of, prime, grain, and, grazing, land, in, north, america, after, it, was, accidentally, introduced, the, klamathweed, beetle, a, species, that, specializes, in, consuming, the, plant, was, imported, during, world, war, ii, within, several, years, klamath, weed, was, reduced, to, a, rare, roadside, weed, in, locations, where, predation, and, mutually, competitive, relationships, are, absent, weeds, have, increased, resources, available, for, growth, and, reproduction, the, weediness, of, some, species, that, are, introduced, into, new, environments, may, be, caused, by, their, production, of, allelopathic, chemicals, which, indigenous, plants, are, not, yet, adapted, to, a, scenario, sometimes, called, the, novel, weapons, hypothesis, these, chemicals, may, limit, the, growth, of, established, plants, or, the, germination, and, growth, of, seeds, and, seedlings, weed, growth, can, also, inhibit, the, growth, of, later, successional, species, in, ecological, succession, introduced, species, have, been, observed, to, undergo, rapid, evolutionary, change, to, adapt, to, their, new, environments, with, changes, in, plant, height, size, leaf, shape, dispersal, ability, reproductive, output, vegetative, reproduction, ability, level, of, dependence, on, the, mycorrhizal, network, and, level, of, phenotype, plasticity, appearing, on, timescales, of, decades, to, centuries, invasive, species, can, be, more, adaptable, in, their, new, environments, than, in, their, native, environments, occupying, broader, ranges, in, areas, where, they, are, invasive, than, in, areas, where, they, are, native, hybridization, between, similar, species, can, produce, novel, invasive, plants, that, are, better, adapted, to, their, surroundings, polyploidy, is, also, observed, to, be, strongly, selected, for, among, some, invasive, populations, such, as, solidago, canadensis, in, china, many, weed, species, are, now, found, almost, worldwide, with, novel, adaptations, that, suit, regional, populations, to, their, environments, some, negative, impacts, of, weeds, are, functional, they, interfere, with, food, and, fiber, production, in, agriculture, wherein, they, must, be, controlled, to, prevent, lost, or, diminished, crop, yields, in, other, settings, they, interfere, with, other, cosmetic, decorative, or, recreational, goals, such, as, in, lawns, landscape, architecture, playing, fields, and, golf, courses, in, the, case, of, invasive, species, they, can, be, of, concern, for, environmental, reasons, when, introduced, species, outcompete, native, plants, and, cause, broader, damage, to, ecosystem, health, and, functioning, some, weed, species, have, been, classified, as, noxious, weeds, by, government, authorities, because, if, left, unchecked, they, often, compete, with, native, or, crop, plants, or, cause, harm, to, livestock, they, are, often, foreign, species, accidentally, or, imprudently, imported, into, a, region, where, there, are, few, natural, controls, to, limit, their, population, and, spread, in, a, range, of, contexts, weeds, can, have, negative, impacts, by, what, would, the, world, be, once, bereft, of, wet, and, wildness, let, them, be, left, o, let, them, be, left, wildness, and, wet, long, live, the, weeds, and, the, wilderness, yet, gerard, manley, hopkins, poem, inversnaid, while, the, term, weed, generally, has, a, negative, connotation, many, plants, known, as, weeds, can, have, beneficial, properties, a, number, of, weeds, such, as, the, dandelion, taraxacum, and, lamb, s, quarter, are, edible, and, their, leaves, or, roots, may, be, used, for, food, or, herbal, medicine, burdock, is, common, over, much, of, the, world, and, is, sometimes, used, to, make, soup, and, medicine, in, east, asia, some, weeds, attract, beneficial, insects, which, in, turn, can, protect, crops, from, harmful, pests, weeds, can, also, prevent, pest, insects, from, finding, a, crop, because, their, presence, disrupts, the, incidence, of, positive, cues, which, pests, use, to, locate, their, food, weeds, may, also, act, as, a, living, mulch, providing, ground, cover, that, reduces, moisture, loss, and, prevents, erosion, weeds, may, also, improve, soil, fertility, dandelions, for, example, bring, up, nutrients, like, calcium, and, nitrogen, from, deep, in, the, soil, with, their, tap, root, and, clover, hosts, nitrogen, fixing, bacteria, in, its, roots, fertilizing, the, soil, directly, the, dandelion, is, also, one, of, several, species, which, break, up, hardpan, in, overly, cultivated, fields, helping, crops, grow, deeper, root, systems, some, garden, flowers, originated, as, weeds, in, cultivated, fields, and, have, been, selectively, bred, for, their, garden, worthy, flowers, or, foliage, an, example, of, a, crop, weed, that, is, grown, in, gardens, is, the, corncockle, agrostemma, githago, which, was, a, common, weed, in, european, wheat, fields, but, is, now, sometimes, grown, as, a, garden, plant, as, pioneer, species, weeds, begin, the, process, of, ecological, succession, after, a, disturbance, event, the, rapid, aggressive, growth, of, weeds, rapidly, prevents, erosion, in, newly, exposed, bare, soil, and, has, substantially, slowed, topsoil, loss, due, to, anthropogenic, disturbances, it, has, been, suggested, that, weeds, with, their, aggressive, ability, to, adapt, could, provide, humans, with, vital, tools, and, knowledge, for, climate, change, adaptation, some, researchers, argue, that, researching, weed, species, could, offer, valuable, insights, for, crop, breeding, or, that, weeds, themselves, hold, potential, as, hardy, climate, change, resistant, crops, adaptable, weeds, could, also, be, a, source, of, transgenic, genes, which, could, confer, useful, traits, upon, crops, weed, species, have, been, used, in, the, restoration, of, land, in, australia, using, a, method, called, natural, sequence, farming, this, method, allows, non, native, weeds, to, stabilize, and, restore, degraded, areas, where, native, species, are, not, yet, capable, of, regenerating, themselves, we, ve, got, to, be, one, of, the, most, bomb, proof, species, on, the, planet, paleontologist, david, jablonsky, an, alternate, definition, often, used, by, biologists, is, any, species, not, just, plants, that, can, quickly, adapt, to, any, environment, some, traits, of, weedy, species, are, the, ability, to, reproduce, quickly, disperse, widely, live, in, a, variety, of, habitats, establish, a, population, in, strange, places, succeed, in, disturbed, ecosystems, and, resist, eradication, once, established, such, species, often, do, well, in, human, dominated, environments, as, other, species, are, not, able, to, adapt, common, examples, include, the, common, pigeon, brown, rat, and, the, raccoon, other, weedy, species, have, been, able, to, expand, their, range, without, actually, living, in, human, environments, as, human, activity, has, damaged, the, ecosystems, of, other, species, these, include, the, coyote, the, white, tailed, deer, and, the, brown, headed, cowbird, in, response, to, the, idea, that, humans, may, face, extinction, due, to, environmental, degradation, paleontologist, david, jablonsky, counters, by, arguing, that, humans, are, a, weed, species, like, other, weedy, species, humans, are, widely, dispersed, in, a, wide, variety, of, environments, and, are, highly, unlikely, to, go, extinct, no, matter, how, much, damage, the, environment, faces, white, clover, is, considered, by, some, to, be, a, weed, in, lawns, but, in, many, other, situations, is, a, desirable, source, of, fodder, honey, and, soil, nitrogen, a, short, list, of, some, plants, that, often, are, considered, to, be, weeds, follows, many, invasive, weeds, were, introduced, deliberately, in, the, first, place, and, may, have, not, been, considered, nuisances, at, the, time, but, rather, beneficial, weed, control, encompasses, a, range, of, methods, used, by, humans, to, stop, reduce, or, prevent, the, growth, and, reproduction, of, weeds, within, agricultural, or, other, managed, environments, some, weed, control, is, preventative, implementing, protocols, to, stop, weeds, from, invading, new, areas, cultural, weed, control, involves, shaping, the, managed, environment, to, make, it, less, favorable, for, weeds, once, weeds, are, present, in, an, area, a, wide, variety, of, means, to, destroy, the, weeds, and, their, seeds, can, be, employed, since, weeds, are, highly, adaptable, relying, on, a, single, method, to, control, weeds, soon, results, in, the, invasion, or, adaptation, of, weeds, that, are, not, susceptible, integrated, pest, management, as, it, applies, to, weeds, refers, to, a, plan, of, controlling, weeds, that, integrates, multiple, methods, of, weed, control, and, prevention, methods, of, preventative, weed, control, include, cleaning, equipment, stopping, existing, weeds, in, nearby, areas, from, producing, seed, and, avoiding, seed, or, manure, that, could, be, contaminated, with, weeds, a, wide, variety, of, cultural, weed, control, methods, are, used, including, cover, cropping, crop, rotation, selecting, the, most, competitive, cultivars, of, crops, mulching, planting, with, optimal, density, and, intercropping, mechanical, methods, of, weed, control, involve, physically, cutting, uprooting, or, otherwise, destroying, weeds, on, small, farms, hand, weeding, is, the, dominant, means, of, weed, control, but, as, larger, farms, dominate, agriculture, this, method, becomes, less, feasible, on, many, operations, however, some, hand, weeding, may, be, an, unavoidable, component, of, weed, control, tillage, mowing, and, burning, are, common, examples, of, mechanical, weed, control, on, larger, scales, new, technology, increases, the, range, of, mechanical, weed, control, options, one, newly, emerging, form, of, mechanical, weed, control, uses, electricity, to, kill, weeds, mechanical, weed, control, has, been, increasingly, replaced, by, the, use, of, herbicides, the, reliance, on, herbicides, has, resulted, in, the, rapid, evolution, of, herbicide, resistance, in, weeds, making, previously, effective, herbicide, treatments, useless, for, the, control, of, weeds, in, particular, glyphosate, which, was, once, considered, a, revolutionary, breakthrough, in, weed, control, was, relied, upon, heavily, when, it, was, first, introduced, to, agriculture, resulting, in, rapid, emergence, of, resistance, as, of, 2023, 58, weed, species, have, developed, resistance, to, glyphosate, herbicide, resistance, in, weeds, has, rapidly, developed, into, new, increasingly, challenging, forms, as, the, plants, continually, evolve, non, target, site, resistance, or, ntsr, is, particularly, difficult, to, counteract, since, it, may, confer, resistance, to, multiple, herbicides, at, once, including, herbicides, the, plants, ancestors, were, never, exposed, to, various, methods, of, adjusting, herbicide, application, to, avoid, resistance, such, as, rotating, herbicides, used, and, tank, mixing, herbicides, have, all, been, questioned, in, terms, of, their, efficacy, for, preventing, resistance, from, arising, understanding, the, habit, of, weeds, is, important, for, non, chemical, methods, of, weed, control, such, as, plowing, surface, scuffling, promotion, of, more, beneficial, cover, crops, and, prevention, of, seed, accumulation, in, fields, for, example, amaranth, is, an, edible, plant, that, is, considered, a, weed, by, mainstream, modern, agriculture, it, produces, copious, seeds, up, to, 1, million, per, plant, that, last, many, years, and, is, an, early, emergent, fast, grower, those, seeking, to, control, amaranth, quote, the, mantra, this, year, s, seeds, become, next, year, s, weeds, however, another, view, of, amaranth, values, the, plant, as, a, resilient, food, source, some, people, have, appreciated, weeds, for, their, tenacity, their, wildness, and, even, the, work, and, connection, to, nature, they, provide, as, christopher, lloyd, wrote, in, the, well, tempered, garden, many, gardeners, will, agree, that, hand, weeding, is, not, the, terrible, drudgery, that, it, is, often, made, out, to, be, some, people, find, in, it, a, kind, of, soothing, monotony, it, leaves, their, minds, free, to, develop, the, plot, for, their, next, novel, or, to, perfect, the, brilliant, repartee, with, which, they, should, have, encountered, a, relative, s, latest, example, of, unreasonableness, as, anthropogenic, climate, change, increases, temperatures, and, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, many, weeds, are, expected, to, become, harder, to, control, and, to, expand, their, ranges, at, the, expense, of, less, weedy, species, for, example, kudzu, the, infamous, invasive, vine, found, throughout, the, southeastern, united, states, is, expected, to, spread, northward, due, to, climate, change, increased, competitive, strength, of, agricultural, weeds, in, future, climate, conditions, threaten, future, ability, to, grow, crops, existing, weed, management, practices, will, likely, fail, under, future, changes, in, climate, conditions, meaning, new, agricultural, techniques, will, be, needed, for, global, food, security, suggested, techniques, are, holistic, transitioning, away, from, reliance, on, herbicide, and, include, aggressive, adaptation, of, agroforestry, and, use, of, allelopathic, crop, residues, to, suppress, weeds
