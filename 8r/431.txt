see, text, insects, in, the, family, tettigoniidae, are, commonly, called, katydids, especially, in, north, america, or, bush, crickets, they, have, previously, been, known, as, long, horned, grasshoppers, more, than, 8, 000, species, are, known, part, of, the, suborder, ensifera, the, tettigoniidae, are, the, only, extant, living, family, in, the, superfamily, tettigonioidea, many, species, are, nocturnal, in, habit, having, strident, mating, calls, and, may, exhibit, mimicry, or, camouflage, commonly, with, shapes, and, colours, similar, to, leaves, the, family, name, tettigoniidae, is, derived, from, the, genus, tettigonia, of, which, the, great, green, bush, cricket, is, the, type, species, it, was, first, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, in, latin, tettigonia, means, a, kind, of, small, cicada, leafhopper, it, is, from, the, greek, tettigonion, the, diminutive, of, the, imitative, onomatopoeic, tettix, cicada, all, of, these, names, such, as, tettix, with, repeated, sounds, are, onomatopoeic, imitating, the, stridulation, of, these, insects, the, common, name, katydid, is, also, onomatopoeic, and, comes, from, the, particularly, loud, three, pulsed, song, often, rendered, ka, ty, did, of, the, nominate, subspecies, of, the, north, american, pterophylla, camellifolia, belonging, to, the, subfamily, pseudophyllinae, which, are, known, as, true, katydids, tettigoniids, range, in, size, from, as, small, as, 5, mm, 0, 20, in, to, as, large, as, 130, mm, 5, 1, in, the, smaller, species, typically, live, in, drier, or, more, stressful, habitats, which, may, lead, to, their, small, size, the, small, size, is, associated, with, greater, agility, faster, development, and, lower, nutritional, needs, tettigoniids, are, tree, living, insects, that, are, most, commonly, heard, at, night, during, summer, and, early, fall, tettigoniids, may, be, distinguished, from, the, grasshopper, by, the, length, of, their, filamentous, antennae, which, may, exceed, their, own, body, length, while, grasshoppers, antennae, are, always, relatively, short, and, thickened, eggs, are, typically, oval, and, may, be, attached, in, rows, to, plants, where, the, eggs, are, deposited, relates, to, the, way, the, ovipositor, is, formed, it, consists, of, up, to, three, pairs, of, appendages, formed, to, transmit, the, egg, to, make, a, place, for, it, and, place, it, properly, tettigoniids, have, either, sickle, shaped, ovipositors, which, typically, lay, eggs, in, dead, or, living, plant, matter, or, uniform, long, ovipositors, which, lay, eggs, in, grass, stems, when, tettigoniids, hatch, the, nymphs, often, look, like, small, wingless, versions, of, the, adults, but, in, some, species, the, nymphs, look, nothing, at, all, like, the, adult, and, rather, mimic, other, species, such, as, ants, spiders, and, assassin, bugs, or, flowers, to, prevent, predation, the, nymphs, remain, in, a, mimic, state, only, until, they, are, large, enough, to, escape, predation, once, they, complete, their, last, molt, after, about, 5, successful, molts, they, are, then, prepared, to, mate, tettigoniids, are, found, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, the, vast, majority, of, katydid, species, live, in, the, tropical, regions, of, the, world, for, example, the, amazon, basin, rain, forest, is, home, to, over, 2, 000, species, of, katydids, however, katydids, are, found, in, the, cool, dry, temperate, regions, as, well, with, about, 255, species, in, north, america, the, tettigoniidae, are, a, large, family, and, have, been, divided, into, a, number, of, subfamilies, the, copiphorinae, were, previously, considered, a, subfamily, but, are, now, placed, as, tribe, copiphorini, in, the, subfamily, conocephalinae, the, genus, acridoxena, is, now, placed, in, the, tribe, acridoxenini, of, the, mecopodinae, previously, its, own, subfamily, acridoxeninae, the, orthoptera, species, file, lists, the, genus, triassophyllum, is, extinct, and, may, be, placed, here, or, in, the, archaeorthoptera, the, diet, of, most, tettigoniids, includes, leaves, flowers, bark, and, seeds, but, many, species, are, exclusively, predatory, feeding, on, other, insects, snails, or, even, small, vertebrates, such, as, snakes, and, lizards, some, are, also, considered, pests, by, commercial, crop, growers, and, are, sprayed, to, limit, growth, but, population, densities, are, usually, low, so, a, large, economic, impact, is, rare, tettigoniids, are, serious, insect, pests, of, karuka, pandanus, julianettii, the, species, segestes, gracilis, and, segestidea, montana, eat, the, leaves, and, can, sometimes, kill, trees, growers, will, stuff, leaves, and, grass, in, between, the, leaves, of, the, crown, to, keep, insects, out, by, observing, the, head, and, mouthparts, where, differences, can, be, seen, in, relation, to, function, it, is, possible, to, determine, what, type, of, food, the, tettigoniids, consume, large, tettigoniids, can, inflict, a, painful, bite, or, pinch, if, handled, but, seldom, break, the, skin, some, species, of, bush, crickets, are, consumed, by, people, such, as, the, nsenene, ruspolia, differens, in, uganda, and, neighbouring, areas, the, males, of, tettigoniids, have, sound, producing, organs, located, on, the, hind, angles, of, their, front, wings, in, some, species, females, are, also, capable, of, stridulation, females, chirp, in, response, to, the, shrill, of, the, males, the, males, use, this, sound, for, courtship, which, occurs, late, in, the, summer, the, sound, is, produced, by, rubbing, two, parts, of, their, bodies, together, called, stridulation, in, many, cases, this, is, done, with, the, wings, but, not, exclusively, one, body, part, bears, a, file, or, comb, with, ridges, the, other, has, the, plectrum, which, runs, over, the, ridges, to, produce, a, vibration, for, tettigoniids, the, fore, wings, are, used, to, sing, tettigoniids, produce, continuous, songs, known, as, trills, the, size, of, the, insect, the, spacing, of, the, ridges, and, the, width, of, the, scraper, all, influence, what, sound, is, made, many, species, stridulate, at, a, tempo, which, is, governed, by, ambient, temperature, so, that, the, number, of, chirps, in, a, defined, period, of, time, can, produce, a, fairly, accurate, temperature, reading, for, american, katydids, the, formula, is, generally, given, as, the, number, of, chirps, in, 15, seconds, plus, 37, to, give, the, temperature, in, degrees, fahrenheit, some, tettigoniids, have, spines, on, different, parts, of, their, bodies, that, work, in, different, ways, the, listroscelinae, have, limb, spines, on, the, ventral, surfaces, of, their, bodies, this, works, in, a, way, to, confine, their, prey, to, make, a, temporary, cage, above, their, mouthparts, the, spines, are, articulated, and, comparatively, flexible, but, relatively, blunt, due, to, this, they, are, used, to, cage, and, not, penetrate, the, prey, s, body, spines, on, the, tibiae, and, the, femora, are, usually, more, sharp, and, nonarticulated, they, are, designed, more, for, penetration, or, help, in, the, defensive, mechanism, they, might, have, this, usually, works, with, their, diurnal, roosting, posture, to, maximize, defense, and, prevent, predators, from, going, for, their, head, when, tettigoniids, go, to, rest, during, the, day, they, enter, a, diurnal, roosting, posture, to, maximize, their, cryptic, qualities, this, position, fools, predators, into, thinking, the, katydid, is, either, dead, or, just, a, leaf, on, the, plant, various, tettigoniids, have, bright, coloration, and, black, apical, spots, on, the, inner, surfaces, of, the, tegmina, and, brightly, colored, hind, wings, by, flicking, their, wings, open, when, disturbed, they, use, the, coloration, to, fool, predators, into, thinking, the, spots, are, eyes, this, in, combination, with, their, coloration, mimicking, leaves, allows, them, to, blend, in, with, their, surroundings, but, also, makes, predators, unsure, which, side, is, the, front, and, which, side, is, the, back, katydid, i, love, to,

provide, a, nuptial, gift, for, the, females, in, the, form, of, a, spermatophylax, a, body, attached, to, the, males, spermatophore, and, consumed, by, the, female, to, distract, her, from, eating, the, male, s, spermatophore, and, thereby, increase, his, paternity, the, tettigoniidae, have, polygamous, relationships, the, first, male, to, mate, is, guaranteed, an, extremely, high, confidence, of, paternity, when, a, second, male, couples, at, the, termination, of, female, sexual, refractoriness, the, nutrients, that, the, offspring, ultimately, receive, will, increase, their, fitness, the, second, male, to, mate, with, the, female, at, the, termination, of, her, refractory, period, is, usually, cuckolded, the, polygamous, relationships, of, the, tettigoniidae, lead, to, high, levels, of, male, male, competition, male, competition, is, caused, by, the, decreased, availability, of, males, able, to, supply, nutritious, spermaphylanges, to, the, females, females, produce, more, eggs, on, a, high, quality, diet, thus, the, female, looks, for, healthier, males, with, a, more, nutritious, spermatophylax, females, use, the, sound, created, by, the, male, to, judge, his, fitness, the, louder, and, more, fluent, the, trill, the, higher, the, fitness, of, the, male, in, species, which, produce, larger, food, gifts, the, female, often, seeks, out, the, males, to, copulate, this, however, is, a, cost, to, females, as, they, risk, predation, while, searching, for, males, also, a, cost, benefit, tradeoff, exists, in, the, size, of, the, spermatophore, which, the, male, tettigoniids, produce, when, males, possess, a, large, spermatophore, they, benefit, by, being, more, highly, selected, for, by, females, but, they, are, only, able, to, mate, one, to, two, times, during, their, lifetimes, inversely, male, tettigoniidae, with, smaller, spermatophores, have, the, benefit, of, being, able, to, mate, two, to, three, times, per, night, but, have, lower, chances, of, being, selected, by, females, even, in, times, of, nutritional, stress, male, tettigoniidae, continue, to, invest, nutrients, within, their, spermatophores, in, some, species, the, cost, of, creating, the, spermatophore, is, low, but, even, in, those, which, it, is, not, low, it, is, still, not, beneficial, to, reduce, the, quality, of, the, spermatophore, as, it, would, lead, to, lower, reproductive, selection, and, success, this, low, reproductive, success, is, attributed, to, some, tettigoniidae, species, in, which, the, spermatophylax, that, the, female, receives, as, a, food, gift, from, the, male, during, copulation, increases, the, reproductive, output, of, the, reproduction, attempt, however, in, other, cases, the, female, receives, few, if, any, benefits, the, reproductive, behavior, of, bush, crickets, has, been, studied, in, great, depth, studies, found, that, the, tuberous, bush, cricket, platycleis, affinis, has, the, largest, testes, in, proportion, to, body, mass, of, any, animal, recorded, they, account, for, 14, of, the, insect, s, body, mass, and, are, thought, to, enable, a, fast, remating, rate
