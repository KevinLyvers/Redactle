see, text, porpoises, p, r, p, s, z, are, small, dolphin, like, cetaceans, classified, under, the, family, phocoenidae, although, similar, in, appearance, to, dolphins, they, are, more, closely, related, to, narwhals, and, belugas, than, to, the, true, dolphins, there, are, eight, extant, species, of, porpoise, all, among, the, smallest, of, the, toothed, whales, porpoises, are, distinguished, from, dolphins, by, their, flattened, spade, shaped, teeth, distinct, from, the, conical, teeth, of, dolphins, and, lack, of, a, pronounced, beak, although, some, dolphins, e, g, hector, s, dolphin, also, lack, a, pronounced, beak, porpoises, and, other, cetaceans, belong, to, the, clade, cetartiodactyla, with, even, toed, ungulates, porpoises, range, in, size, from, the, vaquita, at, 1, 4, metres, 4, feet, 7, inches, in, length, and, 54, kilograms, 119, pounds, in, weight, to, the, dall, s, porpoise, at, 2, 3, m, 7, ft, 7, in, and, 220, kg, 490, lb, several, species, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, in, that, the, females, are, larger, than, males, they, have, streamlined, bodies, and, two, limbs, that, are, modified, into, flippers, porpoises, use, echolocation, as, their, primary, sensory, system, some, species, are, well, adapted, for, diving, to, great, depths, as, all, cetaceans, they, have, a, layer, of, fat, or, blubber, under, the, skin, to, keep, them, warm, in, cold, water, porpoises, are, abundant, and, found, in, a, multitude, of, environments, including, rivers, finless, porpoise, coastal, and, shelf, waters, harbour, porpoise, vaquita, and, open, ocean, dall, s, porpoise, and, spectacled, porpoise, covering, all, water, temperatures, from, tropical, sea, of, cortez, vaquita, to, polar, greenland, harbour, porpoise, porpoises, feed, largely, on, fish, and, squid, much, like, the, rest, of, the, odontocetes, little, is, known, about, reproductive, behaviour, females, may, have, one, calf, every, year, under, favourable, conditions, calves, are, typically, born, in, the, spring, and, summer, months, and, remain, dependent, on, the, female, until, the, following, spring, porpoises, produce, ultrasonic, clicks, which, are, used, for, both, navigation, echolocation, and, social, communication, in, contrast, to, many, dolphin, species, porpoises, do, not, form, large, social, groups, porpoises, were, and, still, are, hunted, by, some, countries, by, means, of, drive, hunting, larger, threats, to, porpoises, include, extensive, bycatch, in, gill, nets, competition, for, food, from, fisheries, and, marine, pollution, in, particular, heavy, metals, and, organochlorides, the, vaquita, is, nearly, extinct, due, to, bycatch, in, gill, nets, with, a, predicted, population, of, fewer, than, a, dozen, individuals, since, the, extinction, of, the, baiji, the, vaquita, is, considered, the, most, endangered, cetacean, some, species, of, porpoises, have, been, and, are, kept, in, captivity, and, trained, for, research, education, and, public, display, porpoises, along, with, whales, and, dolphins, are, descendants, of, land, living, ungulates, hoofed, animals, that, first, entered, the, oceans, around, 50, million, years, ago, mya, during, the, miocene, 23, to, 5, mya, mammals, were, fairly, modern, meaning, they, seldom, changed, physiologically, from, the, time, the, cetaceans, diversified, and, fossil, evidence, suggests, porpoises, and, dolphins, diverged, from, their, last, common, ancestor, around, 15, mya, the, oldest, fossils, are, known, from, the, shallow, seas, around, the, north, pacific, with, animals, spreading, to, the, european, coasts, and, southern, hemisphere, only, much, later, during, the, pliocene, recently, discovered, hybrids, between, male, harbour, porpoises, and, female, dall, s, porpoises, indicate, the, two, species, may, actually, be, members, of, the, same, genus, porpoises, have, a, bulbous, head, no, external, ear, flaps, a, non, flexible, neck, a, torpedo, shaped, body, limbs, modified, into, flippers, and, a, tail, fin, their, skull, has, small, eye, orbits, small, blunt, snouts, and, eyes, placed, on, the, sides, of, the, head, porpoises, range, in, size, from, the, 1, 4, m, 4, ft, 7, in, and, 54, kg, 119, lb, vaquita, to, the, 2, 3, m, 7, ft, 7, in, and, 220, kg, 490, lb, dall, s, porpoise, overall, they, tend, to, be, dwarfed, by, other, cetaceans, almost, all, species, have, female, biased, sexual, dimorphism, with, the, females, being, larger, than, the, males, although, those, physical, differences, are, generally, small, one, exception, is, dall, s, porpoise, odontocetes, possess, teeth, with, cementum, cells, overlying, dentine, cells, unlike, human, teeth, which, are, composed, mostly, of, enamel, on, the, portion, of, the, tooth, outside, of, the, gum, whale, teeth, have, cementum, outside, the, gum, porpoises, have, a, three, chambered, stomach, including, a, fore, stomach, and, fundic, and, pyloric, chambers, porpoises, like, other, odontocetes, possess, only, one, blowhole, breathing, involves, expelling, stale, air, from, the, blowhole, forming, an, upward, steamy, spout, followed, by, inhaling, fresh, air, into, the, lungs, all, porpoises, have, a, thick, layer, of, blubber, this, blubber, can, help, with, insulation, from, the, harsh, underwater, climate, protection, to, some, extent, as, predators, would, have, a, hard, time, getting, through, a, thick, layer, of, fat, and, energy, for, leaner, times, calves, are, born, with, only, a, thin, layer, of, blubber, but, rapidly, gain, a, thick, layer, from, the, milk, which, has, a, very, high, fat, content, porpoises, have, two, flippers, on, the, front, and, a, tail, fin, their, flippers, contain, four, digits, although, porpoises, do, not, possess, fully, developed, hind, limbs, they, possess, discrete, rudimentary, appendages, which, may, contain, feet, and, digits, porpoises, are, fast, swimmers, in, comparison, to, seals, which, typically, cruise, at, 9, 28, km, h, 5, 15, kn, the, fusing, of, the, neck, vertebrae, while, increasing, stability, when, swimming, at, high, speeds, decreases, flexibility, making, it, impossible, for, them, to, turn, their, head, when, swimming, they, move, their, tail, fin, and, lower, body, up, and, down, propelling, themselves, through, vertical, movement, while, their, flippers, are, mainly, used, for, steering, flipper, movement, is, continuous, some, species, log, out, of, the, water, which, may, allow, them, to, travel, faster, and, sometimes, they, porpoise, out, of, the, water, meaning, jump, out, of, the, water, their, skeletal, anatomy, allows, them, to, be, fast, swimmers, they, have, a, very, well, defined, and, triangular, dorsal, fin, allowing, them, to, steer, better, in, the, water, unlike, their, dolphin, counterparts, they, are, adapted, for, coastal, shores, bays, and, estuaries, the, porpoise, ear, has, specific, adaptations, to, the, marine, environment, in, humans, the, middle, ear, works, as, an, impedance, equaliser, between, the, outside, air, s, low, impedance, and, the, cochlear, fluid, s, high, impedance, in, whales, and, other, marine, mammals, there, is, no, great, difference, between, the, outer, and, inner, environments, instead, of, sound, passing, through, the, outer, ear, to, the, middle, ear, porpoises, receive, sound, through, the, throat, from, which, it, passes, through, a, low, impedance, fat, filled, cavity, to, the, inner, ear, the, porpoise, ear, is, acoustically, isolated, from, the, skull, by, air, filled, sinus, pockets, which, allow, for, greater, directional, hearing, underwater, odontocetes, send, out, high, frequency, clicks, from, an, organ, known, as, a, melon, this, melon, consists, of, fat, and, the, skull, of, any, such, creature, containing, a, melon, will, have, a, large, depression, the, large, bulge, on, top, of, the, porpoises, head, is, caused, by, the, melon, the, porpoise, eye, is, relatively, small, for, its, size, yet, they, do, retain, a, good, degree, of, eyesight, as, well, as, this, the, eyes, of, a, porpoise, are, placed, on, the, sides, of, its, head, so, their, vision, consists, of, two, fields, rather, than, a, binocular, view, like, humans, have, when, porpoises, surface, their, lens, and, cornea, correct, the, nearsightedness, that, results, from, the, refraction, of, light, their, eyes, contain, both, rod, and, cone, cells, meaning, they, can, see, in, both, dim, and, bright, light, porpoises, do, however, lack, short, wavelength, sensitive, visual, pigments, in, their, cone, cells, indicating, a, more, limited, capacity, for, colour, vision, than, most, mammals, most, porpoises, have, slightly, flattened, eyeballs, enlarged, pupils, which, shrink, as, they, surface, to, prevent, damage, slightly, flattened, corneas, and, a, tapetum, lucidum, these, adaptations, allow, for, large, amounts, of, light, to, pass, through, the, eye, and, therefore, they, are, able, to, form, a, very, clear, image, of, the, surrounding, area, the, olfactory, lobes, are, absent, in, porpoises, suggesting, that, they, have, no, sense, of, smell, porpoises, are, not, thought, to, have, a, good, sense, of, taste, as, their, taste, buds, are, atrophied, or, missing, altogether, however, some, have, preferences, between, different, kinds, of, fish, indicating, some, sort, of, attachment, to, taste, unlike, most, animals, porpoises, are, conscious, breathers, all, mammals, sleep, but, porpoises, cannot, afford, to, become, unconscious, for, long, because, they, may, drown, while, knowledge, of, sleep, in, wild, cetaceans, is, limited, porpoises, in, captivity, have, been, recorded, to, sleep, with, one, side, of, their, brain, at, a, time, so, that, they, may, swim, breathe, consciously, and, avoid, both, predators, and, social, contact, during, their, period, of, rest, porpoises, are, fully, aquatic, creatures, females, deliver, a, single, calf, after, a, gestation, period, lasting, about, a, year, calving, takes, place, entirely, under, water, with, the, foetus, positioned, for, tail, first, delivery, to, help, prevent, drowning, females, have, mammary, glands, but, the, shape, of, a, newborn, calf, s, mouth, does, not, allow, it, to, obtain, a, seal, around, the, nipple, instead, of, the, calf, sucking, milk, the, mother, squirts, milk, into, the, calf, s, mouth, this, milk, contains, high, amounts, of, fat, which, aids, in, the, development, of, blubber, it, contains, so, much, fat, that, it, has, the, consistency, of, toothpaste, the, calves, are, weaned, at, about, 11, months, of, age, males, play, no, part, in, rearing, calves, the, calf, is, dependent, for, one, to, two, years, and, maturity, occurs, after, seven, to, ten, years, all, varying, between, species, this, mode, of, reproduction, produces, few, offspring, but, increases, the, probability, of, each, one, surviving, porpoises, eat, a, wide, variety, of, creatures, the, stomach, contents, of, harbour, porpoises, suggests, that, they, mainly, feed, on, benthic, fish, and, sometimes, pelagic, fish, they, may, also, eat, benthic, invertebrates, in, rare, cases, algae, such, as, ulva, lactuca, is, consumed, atlantic, porpoises, are, thought, to, follow, the, seasonal, migration, of, bait, fish, like, herring, and, their, diet, varies, between, seasons, the, stomach, contents, of, dall, s, porpoises, reveal, that, they, mainly, feed, on, cephalopods, and, bait, fish, like, capelin, and, sardines, their, stomachs, also, contained, some, deep, sea, benthic, organisms, the, finless, porpoise, is, known, to, also, follow, seasonal, migrations, it, is, known, that, populations, in, the, mouth, of, the, indus, river, migrate, to, the, sea, from, april, through, october, to, feed, on, the, annual, spawning, of, prawns, in, japan, sightings, of, small, pods, of, them, herding, sand, lance, onto, shore, are, common, year, round, little, is, known, about, the, diets, of, other, species, of, porpoises, a, dissection, of, three, burmeister, s, porpoises, shows, that, they, consume, shrimp, and, euphausiids, krill, a, dissection, of, a, beached, vaquita, showed, remains, of, squid, and, grunts, nothing, is, known, about, the, diet, of, the, spectacled, porpoise, the, tube, in, the, head, through, which, this, kind, fish, takes, its, breath, and, spitting, water, located, in, front, of, the, brain, and, ends, outwardly, in, a, simple, hole, but, inside, it, is, divided, by, a, downward, bony, septum, as, if, it, were, two, nostrils, but, underneath, it, opens, up, again, in, the, mouth, in, a, void, john, ray, 1671, the, earliest, description, of, cetacean, airways, in, aristotle, s, time, the, 4th, century, bce, porpoises, were, regarded, as, fish, due, to, their, superficial, similarity, aristotle, however, could, already, see, many, physiological, and, anatomical, similarities, with, the, terrestrial, vertebrates, such, as, blood, circulation, lungs, uterus, and, fin, anatomy, his, detailed, descriptions, were, assimilated, by, the, romans, but, mixed, with, a, more, accurate, knowledge, of, the, dolphins, as, mentioned, by, pliny, the, elder, in, his, natural, history, in, the, art, of, this, and, subsequent, periods, porpoises, are, portrayed, with, a, long, snout, typical, of, dolphins, and, a, high, arched, head, the, harbour, porpoise, was, one, of, the, most, accessible, species, for, early, cetologists, because, it, could, be, seen, very, close, to, land, inhabiting, shallow, coastal, areas, of, europe, much, of, the, findings, that, apply, to, all, cetaceans, were, first, discovered, in, porpoises, one, of, the, first, anatomical, descriptions, of, the, airways, of, the, whales, on, the, basis, of, a, harbor, porpoise, dates, from, 1671, by, john, ray, it, nevertheless, referred, to, the, porpoise, as, a, fish, most, likely, not, in, the, modern, day, sense, where, it, refers, to, a, zoological, group, but, the, older, reference, as, simply, a, creature, of, the, sea, cf, for, example, star, fish, cuttle, fish, jelly, fish, and, whale, fish, harbour, porpoises, have, historically, been, kept, in, captivity, under, the, assumption, that, they, would, fare, better, than, their, dolphin, counterparts, due, to, their, smaller, size, and, shallow, water, habitats, up, until, the, 1980s, they, were, consistently, short, lived, harbour, porpoises, have, a, very, long, captive, history, with, poorly, documented, attempts, as, early, as, the, 15th, century, and, better, documented, starting, in, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, in, london, zoo, the, now, closed, brighton, aquarium, dolphinarium, and, a, zoo, in, germany, at, least, 150, harbour, porpoises, have, been, kept, worldwide, but, only, about, 20, were, actively, caught, for, captivity, the, captive, history, is, best, documented, from, denmark, where, about, 100, harbour, porpoises, have, been, kept, most, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, all, but, two, were, incidental, catches, in, fishing, nets, or, strandings, nearly, half, of, these, died, within, a, month, of, diseases, caught, before, they, were, captured, or, from, damage, sustained, during, capture, up, until, 1984, none, lived, for, more, than, 14, months, attempts, to, rehabilitate, seven, rescued, individuals, in, 1986, only, resulted, in, three, that, could, be, released, 6, months, later, very, few, have, been, brought, into, captivity, later, but, they, have, lived, considerably, longer, in, recent, decades, the, only, place, keeping, the, species, in, denmark, is, the, fjord, b, lt, centre, where, three, rescues, have, been, kept, along, with, their, offspring, among, the, three, rescues, one, father, of, world, s, first, harbour, porpoise, born, in, captivity, lived, for, 20, years, in, captivity, another, for, 15, years, while, the, third, mother, of, first, born, in, captivity, is, the, world, s, oldest, known, harbour, porpoise, being, 28, years, old, in, 2023, the, typical, age, reached, in, the, wild, is, 14, years, or, less, very, few, harbour, porpoises, have, been, born, in, captivity, historically, harbour, porpoises, were, often, kept, singly, and, those, who, were, together, often, were, not, mature, or, of, the, same, sex, disregarding, one, born, more, than, 100, years, ago, that, was, the, result, of, a, pregnant, female, being, brought, into, captivity, the, world, s, first, full, captive, breeding, was, in, 2007, in, the, fjord, b, lt, centre, followed, by, another, in, 2009, in, the, dolfinarium, harderwijk, the, netherlands, in, addition, to, the, few, kept, in, europe, harbour, porpoise, were, displayed, at, the, vancouver, aquarium, canada, until, recently, this, was, a, female, that, had, beached, herself, onto, horseshoe, bay, in, 2008, and, a, male, that, had, done, the, same, in, 2011, they, died, in, 2017, and, 2016, respectively, finless, porpoises, have, commonly, been, kept, in, japan, as, well, as, china, and, indonesia, as, of, 1984, ninety, four, in, total, had, been, in, captivity, in, japan, eleven, in, china, and, at, least, two, in, indonesia, as, of, 1986, three, establishments, in, japan, had, bred, them, and, there, had, been, five, recorded, births, three, calves, died, moments, after, their, birth, but, two, survived, for, several, years, this, breeding, success, combined, with, the, results, with, harbour, porpoise, in, denmark, and, the, netherlands, proved, that, porpoises, can, be, successfully, bred, in, captivity, and, this, could, open, up, new, conservation, options, the, reopened, miyajima, public, aquarium, japan, houses, three, finless, porpoises, as, part, of, an, attempt, of, saving, the, narrow, ridged, or, yangtze, finless, porpoise, several, are, kept, in, the, baiji, dolphinarium, in, china, after, having, been, kept, in, captivity, for, 9, years, the, first, breeding, happened, in, 2005, small, numbers, of, dall, s, porpoises, have, been, kept, in, captivity, in, both, the, united, states, and, japan, with, the, most, recent, being, in, the, 1980s, the, first, recorded, instance, of, a, dall, s, taken, for, an, aquarium, was, in, 1956, captured, off, catalina, island, in, southern, california, dall, s, porpoises, consistently, failed, to, thrive, in, captivity, these, animals, often, repeatedly, ran, into, the, walls, of, their, enclosures, refused, food, and, exhibited, skin, sloughing, almost, all, dall, s, porpoises, introduced, to, aquaria, died, shortly, after, typically, within, days, only, two, have, lived, for, more, than, 60, days, a, male, reached, 15, months, at, marineland, of, the, pacific, and, another, 21, months, at, a, united, states, navy, facility, as, part, of, last, ditch, effort, of, saving, the, extremely, rare, vaquita, the, tiny, remaining, population, is, rapidly, declining, because, of, bycatch, in, gillnets, there, have, been, attempts, of, transferring, some, to, captivity, the, first, and, only, caught, for, captivity, were, two, females, in, 2017, both, became, distressed, and, were, rapidly, released, but, one, of, them, died, in, the, process, soon, after, the, project, was, abandoned, only, a, single, burmeister, s, porpoise, and, a, single, spectacled, porpoise, have, been, kept, in, captivity, both, were, stranded, individuals, that, only, survived, a, few, days, after, their, rescue, porpoises, and, other, smaller, cetaceans, have, traditionally, been, hunted, in, many, areas, at, least, in, asia, europe, and, north, america, for, their, meat, and, blubber, a, dominant, hunting, technique, is, drive, hunting, where, a, pod, of, animals, is, driven, together, with, boats, and, usually, into, a, bay, or, onto, a, beach, their, escape, is, prevented, by, closing, off, the, route, to, the, ocean, with, other, boats, or, nets, this, type, of, fishery, for, harbour, porpoises, is, best, documented, from, the, danish, straits, where, it, occurred, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, it, was, banned, in, 1899, and, again, during, the, shortages, in, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, the, inuit, in, the, arctic, hunt, harbour, porpoises, by, shooting, and, drive, hunt, for, dall, s, porpoise, still, takes, place, in, japan, the, number, of, individuals, taken, each, year, is, in, the, thousands, although, a, quota, of, around, 17, 000, per, year, is, in, effect, today, making, it, the, largest, direct, hunt, of, any, cetacean, species, in, the, world, and, the, sustainability, of, the, hunt, has, been, questioned, porpoises, are, highly, affected, by, bycatch, many, porpoises, mainly, the, vaquita, are, subject, to, great, mortality, due, to, gillnetting, although, it, is, the, world, s, most, endangered, marine, cetacean, the, vaquita, continues, to, be, caught, in, small, mesh, gillnet, fisheries, throughout, much, of, its, range, incidental, mortality, caused, by, the, fleet, of, el, golfo, de, santa, clara, was, estimated, to, be, at, around, 39, vaquitas, per, year, which, is, over, 17, of, the, population, size, harbour, porpoises, also, suffer, drowning, by, gillnetting, but, on, a, less, threatening, scale, due, to, their, high, population, their, mortality, rate, per, year, increases, a, mere, 5, due, to, this, the, fishing, market, historically, has, always, had, a, porpoise, bycatch, today, the, marine, mammal, protection, act, of, 1972, has, enforced, the, use, of, safer, fishing, equipment, to, reduce, bycatch, porpoises, are, very, sensitive, to, anthropogenic, disturbances, and, are, keystone, species, which, can, indicate, the, overall, health, of, the, marine, environment, populations, of, harbor, porpoises, in, the, north, and, baltic, seas, are, under, increasing, pressure, from, anthropogenic, causes, such, as, offshore, construction, ship, traffic, fishing, and, military, exercises, increasing, pollution, is, a, serious, problem, for, marine, mammals, heavy, metals, and, plastic, waste, are, not, biodegradable, and, sometimes, cetaceans, consume, these, hazardous, materials, mistaking, them, for, food, items, as, a, result, the, animals, are, more, susceptible, to, diseases, and, have, fewer, offspring, harbour, porpoises, from, the, english, channel, were, found, to, have, accumulated, heavy, metals, the, military, and, geologists, employ, strong, sonar, and, produce, an, increases, in, noise, in, the, oceans, marine, mammals, that, make, use, of, biosonar, for, orientation, and, communication, are, not, only, hindered, by, the, extra, noise, but, may, race, to, the, surface, in, panic, this, may, lead, to, a, bubbling, out, of, blood, gases, and, the, animal, then, dies, because, the, blood, vessels, become, blocked, so, called, decompression, sickness, this, effect, of, course, only, occurs, in, porpoises, that, dive, to, great, depths, such, as, dall, s, porpoise, additionally, civilian, vessels, produce, sonar, waves, to, measure, the, depth, of, the, body, of, water, in, which, they, are, similar, to, the, navy, some, boats, produce, waves, that, attract, porpoises, while, others, may, repel, them, the, problem, with, the, waves, that, attract, is, that, the, animal, may, be, injured, or, even, killed, by, being, hit, by, the, vessel, or, its, propeller, the, harbour, porpoise, spectacled, porpoise, burmeister, s, porpoise, and, dall, s, porpoise, are, all, listed, on, appendix, ii, of, the, convention, on, the, conservation, of, migratory, species, of, wild, animals, cms, in, addition, the, harbour, porpoise, is, covered, by, the, agreement, on, the, conservation, of, small, cetaceans, of, the, baltic, north, east, atlantic, irish, and, north, seas, ascobans, the, agreement, on, the, conservation, of, cetaceans, in, the, black, sea, mediterranean, sea, and, contiguous, atlantic, area, accobams, and, the, memorandum, of, understanding, concerning, the, conservation, of, the, manatee, and, small, cetaceans, of, western, africa, and, macaronesia, their, conservation, statuses, are, either, at, least, concern, or, data, deficient, as, of, 2014, only, 505, yangtze, finless, porpoises, remained, in, the, main, section, of, the, yangtze, with, an, alarming, population, density, in, ezhou, and, zhenjiang, while, many, threatened, species, decline, rate, slows, after, their, classification, population, decline, rates, of, the, porpoise, are, actually, accelerating, while, population, decline, tracked, from, 1994, to, 2008, has, been, pegged, at, a, rate, of, 6, 06, annually, from, 2006, to, 2012, the, porpoise, population, decreased, by, more, than, half, finless, porpoise, population, decrease, of, 69, 8, in, just, a, 22, year, span, from, 1976, to, 2000, 5, 3, a, majority, of, factors, of, this, population, decline, are, being,
