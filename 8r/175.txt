chlorophyll, is, any, of, several, related, green, pigments, found, in, cyanobacteria, and, in, the, chloroplasts, of, algae, and, plants, its, name, is, derived, from, the, greek, words, khloros, pale, green, and, phyllon, leaf, chlorophyll, allows, plants, to, absorb, energy, from, light, chlorophylls, absorb, light, most, strongly, in, the, blue, portion, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, as, well, as, the, red, portion, conversely, it, is, a, poor, absorber, of, green, and, near, green, portions, of, the, spectrum, hence, chlorophyll, containing, tissues, appear, green, because, green, light, diffusively, reflected, by, structures, like, cell, walls, is, less, absorbed, two, types, of, chlorophyll, exist, in, the, photosystems, of, green, plants, chlorophyll, a, and, b, chlorophyll, was, first, isolated, and, named, by, joseph, bienaim, caventou, and, pierre, joseph, pelletier, in, 1817, the, presence, of, magnesium, in, chlorophyll, was, discovered, in, 1906, and, was, the, first, detection, of, that, element, in, living, tissue, after, initial, work, done, by, german, chemist, richard, willst, tter, spanning, from, 1905, to, 1915, the, general, structure, of, chlorophyll, a, was, elucidated, by, hans, fischer, in, 1940, by, 1960, when, most, of, the, stereochemistry, of, chlorophyll, a, was, known, robert, burns, woodward, published, a, total, synthesis, of, the, molecule, in, 1967, the, last, remaining, stereochemical, elucidation, was, completed, by, ian, fleming, and, in, 1990, woodward, and, co, authors, published, an, updated, synthesis, chlorophyll, f, was, announced, to, be, present, in, cyanobacteria, and, other, oxygenic, microorganisms, that, form, stromatolites, in, 2010, a, molecular, formula, of, c, 55, h, 70, o, 6, n, 4, mg, and, a, structure, of, 2, formyl, chlorophyll, a, were, deduced, based, on, nmr, optical, and, mass, spectra, chlorophyll, is, vital, for, photosynthesis, which, allows, plants, to, absorb, energy, from, light, chlorophyll, molecules, are, arranged, in, and, around, photosystems, that, are, embedded, in, the, thylakoid, membranes, of, chloroplasts, in, these, complexes, chlorophyll, serves, three, functions, the, two, currently, accepted, photosystem, units, are, photosystem, i, and, photosystem, ii, which, have, their, own, distinct, reaction, centres, named, p700, and, p680, respectively, these, centres, are, named, after, the, wavelength, in, nanometers, of, their, red, peak, absorption, maximum, the, identity, function, and, spectral, properties, of, the, types, of, chlorophyll, in, each, photosystem, are, distinct, and, determined, by, each, other, and, the, protein, structure, surrounding, them, the, function, of, the, reaction, center, of, chlorophyll, is, to, absorb, light, energy, and, transfer, it, to, other, parts, of, the, photosystem, the, absorbed, energy, of, the, photon, is, transferred, to, an, electron, in, a, process, called, charge, separation, the, removal, of, the, electron, from, the, chlorophyll, is, an, oxidation, reaction, the, chlorophyll, donates, the, high, energy, electron, to, a, series, of, molecular, intermediates, called, an, electron, transport, chain, the, charged, reaction, center, of, chlorophyll, p680, is, then, reduced, back, to, its, ground, state, by, accepting, an, electron, stripped, from, water, the, electron, that, reduces, p680, ultimately, comes, from, the, oxidation, of, water, into, o, 2, and, h, through, several, intermediates, this, reaction, is, how, photosynthetic, organisms, such, as, plants, produce, o, 2, gas, and, is, the, source, for, practically, all, the, o, 2, in, earth, s, atmosphere, photosystem, i, typically, works, in, series, with, photosystem, ii, thus, the, p700, of, photosystem, i, is, usually, reduced, as, it, accepts, the, electron, via, many, intermediates, in, the, thylakoid, membrane, by, electrons, coming, ultimately, from, photosystem, ii, electron, transfer, reactions, in, the, thylakoid, membranes, are, complex, however, and, the, source, of, electrons, used, to, reduce, p700, can, vary, the, electron, flow, produced, by, the, reaction, center, chlorophyll, pigments, is, used, to, pump, h, ions, across, the, thylakoid, membrane, setting, up, a, proton, motive, force, a, chemiosmotic, potential, used, mainly, in, the, production, of, atp, stored, chemical, energy, or, to, reduce, nadp, to, nadph, nadph, is, a, universal, agent, used, to, reduce, co, 2, into, sugars, as, well, as, other, biosynthetic, reactions, reaction, center, chlorophyll, protein, complexes, are, capable, of, directly, absorbing, light, and, performing, charge, separation, events, without, the, assistance, of, other, chlorophyll, pigments, but, the, probability, of, that, happening, under, a, given, light, intensity, is, small, thus, the, other, chlorophylls, in, the, photosystem, and, antenna, pigment, proteins, all, cooperatively, absorb, and, funnel, light, energy, to, the, reaction, center, besides, chlorophyll, a, there, are, other, pigments, called, accessory, pigments, which, occur, in, these, pigment, protein, antenna, complexes, several, chlorophylls, are, known, all, are, defined, as, derivatives, of, the, parent, chlorin, by, the, presence, of, a, fifth, ketone, containing, ring, beyond, the, four, pyrrole, like, rings, most, chlorophylls, are, classified, as, chlorins, which, are, reduced, relatives, of, porphyrins, found, in, hemoglobin, they, share, a, common, biosynthetic, pathway, with, porphyrins, including, the, precursor, uroporphyrinogen, iii, unlike, hemes, which, contain, iron, bound, to, the, n4, center, most, chlorophylls, bind, magnesium, the, axial, ligands, attached, to, the, mg, 2, center, are, often, omitted, for, clarity, appended, to, the, chlorin, ring, are, various, side, chains, usually, including, a, long, phytyl, chain, c, 20, h, 39, o, the, most, widely, distributed, form, in, terrestrial, plants, is, chlorophyll, a, the, only, difference, between, chlorophyll, a, and, chlorophyll, b, is, that, the, former, has, a, methyl, group, where, the, latter, has, a, formyl, group, this, difference, causes, a, considerable, difference, in, the, absorption, spectrum, allowing, plants, to, absorb, a, greater, portion, of, visible, light, the, structures, of, chlorophylls, are, summarized, below, chlorophyll, e, is, reserved, for, a, pigment, that, has, been, extracted, from, algae, in, 1966, but, not, chemically, described, besides, the, lettered, chlorophylls, a, wide, variety, of, sidechain, modifications, to, the, chlorophyll, structures, are, known, in, the, wild, for, example, prochlorococcus, a, cyanobacterium, uses, 8, vinyl, chl, a, and, b, chlorophylls, can, be, extracted, from, the, protein, into, organic, solvents, in, this, way, the, concentration, of, chlorophyll, within, a, leaf, can, be, estimated, methods, also, exist, to, separate, chlorophyll, a, and, chlorophyll, b, in, diethyl, ether, chlorophyll, a, has, approximate, absorbance, maxima, of, 430, nm, and, 662, nm, while, chlorophyll, b, has, approximate, maxima, of, 453, nm, and, 642, nm, the, absorption, peaks, of, chlorophyll, a, are, at, 465, nm, and, 665, nm, chlorophyll, a, fluoresces, at, 673, nm, maximum, and, 726, nm, the, peak, molar, absorption, coefficient, of, chlorophyll, a, exceeds, 10, 5, m, 1, cm, 1, which, is, among, the, highest, for, small, molecule, organic, compounds, in, 90, acetone, water, the, peak, absorption, wavelengths, of, chlorophyll, a, are, 430, nm, and, 664, nm, peaks, for, chlorophyll, b, are, 460, nm, and, 647, nm, peaks, for, chlorophyll, c, 1, are, 442, nm, and, 630, nm, peaks, for, chlorophyll, c, 2, are, 444, nm, and, 630, nm, peaks, for, chlorophyll, d, are, 401, nm, 455, nm, and, 696, nm, ratio, fluorescence, emission, can, be, used, to, measure, chlorophyll, content, by, exciting, chlorophyll, a, fluorescence, at, a, lower, wavelength, the, ratio, of, chlorophyll, fluorescence, emission, at, 705, 10, nm, and, 735, 10, nm, can, provide, a, linear, relationship, of, chlorophyll, content, when, compared, with, chemical, testing, the, ratio, f, 735, f, 700, provided, a, correlation, value, of, r, 2, 0, 96, compared, with, chemical, testing, in, the, range, from, 41, mg, m, 2, up, to, 675, mg, m, 2, gitelson, also, developed, a, formula, for, direct, readout, of, chlorophyll, content, in, mg, m, 2, the, formula, provided, a, reliable, method, of, measuring, chlorophyll, content, from, 41, mg, m, 2, up, to, 675, mg, m, 2, with, a, correlation, r, 2, value, of, 0, 95, the, dualex, is, an, optical, sensor, used, in, plant, science, and, agriculture, for, the, assessment, of, chlorophyll, contents, in, leaves, this, device, allows, researchers, to, perform, real, time, and, non, destructive, measurements, in, some, plants, chlorophyll, is, derived, from, glutamate, and, is, synthesised, along, a, branched, biosynthetic, pathway, that, is, shared, with, heme, and, siroheme, chlorophyll, synthase, is, the, enzyme, that, completes, the, biosynthesis, of, chlorophyll, a, this, conversion, forms, an, ester, of, the, carboxylic, acid, group, in, chlorophyllide, a, with, the, 20, carbon, diterpene, alcohol, phytol, chlorophyll, b, is, made, by, the, same, enzyme, acting, on, chlorophyllide, b, the, same, is, known, for, chlorophyll, d, and, f, both, made, from, corresponding, chlorophyllides, ultimately, made, from, chlorophyllide, a, in, angiosperm, plants, the, later, steps, in, the, biosynthetic, pathway, are, light, dependent, such, plants, are, pale, etiolated, if, grown, in, darkness, non, vascular, plants, and, green, algae, have, an, additional, light, independent, enzyme, and, grow, green, even, in, darkness, chlorophyll, is, bound, to, proteins, protochlorophyllide, one, of, the, biosynthetic, intermediates, occurs, mostly, in, the, free, form, and, under, light, conditions, acts, as, a, photosensitizer, forming, free, radicals, which, can, be, toxic, to, the, plant, hence, plants, regulate, the, amount, of, this, chlorophyll, precursor, in, angiosperms, this, regulation, is, achieved, at, the, step, of, aminolevulinic, acid, ala, one, of, the, intermediate, compounds, in, the, biosynthesis, pathway, plants, that, are, fed, by, ala, accumulate, high, and, toxic, levels, of, protochlorophyllide, so, do, the, mutants, with, a, damaged, regulatory, system, the, process, of, plant, senescence, involves, the, degradation, of, chlorophyll, for, example, the, enzyme, chlorophyllase, ec, 3, 1, 1, 14, hydrolyses, the, phytyl, sidechain, to, reverse, the, reaction, in, which, chlorophylls, are, biosynthesised, from, chlorophyllide, a, or, b, since, chlorophyllide, a, can, be, converted, to, chlorophyllide, b, and, the, latter, can, be, re, esterified, to, chlorophyll, b, these, processes, allow, cycling, between, chlorophylls, a, and, b, moreover, chlorophyll, b, can, be, directly, reduced, via, 7, 1, hydroxychlorophyll, a, back, to, chlorophyll, a, completing, the, cycle, in, later, stages, of, senescence, chlorophyllides, are, converted, to, a, group, of, colourless, tetrapyrroles, known, as, nonfluorescent, chlorophyll, catabolites, ncc, s, with, the, general, structure, these, compounds, have, also, been, identified, in, ripening, fruits, and, they, give, characteristic, autumn, colours, to, deciduous, plants, the, chlorophyll, maps, show, milligrams, of, chlorophyll, per, cubic, meter, of, seawater, each, month, places, where, chlorophyll, amounts, were, very, low, indicating, very, low, numbers, of, phytoplankton, are, blue, places, where, chlorophyll, concentrations, were, high, meaning, many, phytoplankton, were, growing, are, yellow, the, observations, come, from, the, moderate, resolution, imaging, spectroradiometer, modis, on, nasa, s, aqua, satellite, land, is, dark, gray, and, places, where, modis, could, not, collect, data, because, of, sea, ice, polar, darkness, or, clouds, are, light, gray, the, highest, chlorophyll, concentrations, where, tiny, surface, dwelling, ocean, plants, are, thriving, are, in, cold, polar, waters, or, in, places, where, ocean, currents, bring, cold, water, to, the, surface, such, as, around, the, equator, and, along, the, shores, of, continents, it, is, not, the, cold, water, itself, that, stimulates, the, phytoplankton, instead, the, cool, temperatures, are, often, a, sign, that, the, water, has, welled, up, to, the, surface, from, deeper, in, the, ocean, carrying, nutrients, that, have, built, up, over, time, in, polar, waters, nutrients, accumulate, in, surface, waters, during, the, dark, winter, months, when, plants, cannot, grow, when, sunlight, returns, in, the, spring, and, summer, the, plants, flourish, in, high, concentrations, synthetic, chlorophyll, is, registered, as, a, food, additive, colorant, and, its, e, number, is, e140, chefs, use, chlorophyll, to, color, a, variety, of, foods, and, beverages, green, such, as, pasta, and, spirits, absinthe, gains, its, green, color, naturally, from, the, chlorophyll, introduced, through, the, large, variety, of, herbs, used, in, its, production, chlorophyll, is, not, soluble, in, water, and, it, is, first, mixed, with, a, small, quantity, of, vegetable, oil, to, obtain, the, desired, solution, a, 2002, study, found, that, leaves, exposed, to, strong, light, contained, degraded, major, antenna, proteins, unlike, those, kept, in, the, dark, which, is, consistent, with, studies, on, the, illumination, of, isolated, proteins, this, appeared, to, the, authors, as, support, for, the, hypothesis, that, active, oxygen, species, play, a, role, in, vivo, in, the, short, term, behaviour, of, plants
