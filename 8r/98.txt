pain, is, a, distressing, feeling, often, caused, by, intense, or, damaging, stimuli, the, international, association, for, the, study, of, pain, defines, pain, as, an, unpleasant, sensory, and, emotional, experience, associated, with, or, resembling, that, associated, with, actual, or, potential, tissue, damage, pain, motivates, organisms, to, withdraw, from, damaging, situations, to, protect, a, damaged, body, part, while, it, heals, and, to, avoid, similar, experiences, in, the, future, most, pain, resolves, once, the, noxious, stimulus, is, removed, and, the, body, has, healed, but, it, may, persist, despite, removal, of, the, stimulus, and, apparent, healing, of, the, body, sometimes, pain, arises, in, the, absence, of, any, detectable, stimulus, damage, or, disease, pain, is, the, most, common, reason, for, physician, consultation, in, most, developed, countries, it, is, a, major, symptom, in, many, medical, conditions, and, can, interfere, with, a, person, s, quality, of, life, and, general, functioning, people, in, pain, experience, impaired, concentration, working, memory, mental, flexibility, problem, solving, and, information, processing, speed, and, are, more, likely, to, experience, irritability, depression, and, anxiety, simple, pain, medications, are, useful, in, 20, to, 70, of, cases, psychological, factors, such, as, social, support, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, excitement, or, distraction, can, affect, pain, s, intensity, or, unpleasantness, first, attested, in, english, in, 1297, the, word, peyn, comes, from, the, old, french, peine, in, turn, from, latin, poena, meaning, punishment, penalty, also, meaning, torment, hardship, suffering, in, late, latin, and, that, from, greek, poine, generally, meaning, price, paid, penalty, punishment, the, international, association, for, the, study, of, pain, recommends, using, specific, features, to, describe, a, patient, s, pain, pain, is, usually, transitory, lasting, only, until, the, noxious, stimulus, is, removed, or, the, underlying, damage, or, pathology, has, healed, but, some, painful, conditions, such, as, rheumatoid, arthritis, peripheral, neuropathy, cancer, and, idiopathic, pain, may, persist, for, years, pain, that, lasts, a, long, time, is, called, chronic, or, persistent, and, pain, that, resolves, quickly, is, called, acute, traditionally, the, distinction, between, acute, and, chronic, pain, has, relied, upon, an, arbitrary, interval, of, time, between, onset, and, resolution, the, two, most, commonly, used, markers, being, 3, months, and, 6, months, since, the, onset, of, pain, though, some, theorists, and, researchers, have, placed, the, transition, from, acute, to, chronic, pain, at, 12, months, 93, others, apply, acute, to, pain, that, lasts, less, than, 30, days, chronic, to, pain, of, more, than, six, months, duration, and, subacute, to, pain, that, lasts, from, one, to, six, months, a, popular, alternative, definition, of, chronic, pain, involving, no, arbitrarily, fixed, duration, is, pain, that, extends, beyond, the, expected, period, of, healing, chronic, pain, may, be, classified, as, cancer, related, or, benign, allodynia, is, pain, experienced, in, response, to, a, normally, painless, stimulus, it, has, no, biological, function, and, is, classified, by, characteristics, of, the, stimuli, as, cold, heat, touch, pressure, or, a, pinprick, phantom, pain, is, pain, felt, in, a, part, of, the, body, that, has, been, amputated, or, from, which, the, brain, no, longer, receives, signals, it, is, a, type, of, neuropathic, pain, the, prevalence, of, phantom, pain, in, upper, limb, amputees, is, nearly, 82, and, in, lower, limb, amputees, is, 54, one, study, found, that, eight, days, after, amputation, 72, of, patients, had, phantom, limb, pain, and, six, months, later, 67, reported, it, some, amputees, experience, continuous, pain, that, varies, in, intensity, or, quality, others, experience, several, bouts, of, pain, per, day, or, it, may, reoccur, less, often, it, is, often, described, as, shooting, crushing, burning, or, cramping, if, the, pain, is, continuous, for, a, long, period, parts, of, the, intact, body, may, become, sensitized, so, that, touching, them, evokes, pain, in, the, phantom, limb, phantom, limb, pain, may, accompany, urination, or, defecation, 61, 69, local, anesthetic, injections, into, the, nerves, or, sensitive, areas, of, the, stump, may, relieve, pain, for, days, weeks, or, sometimes, permanently, despite, the, drug, wearing, off, in, a, matter, of, hours, and, small, injections, of, hypertonic, saline, into, the, soft, tissue, between, vertebrae, produces, local, pain, that, radiates, into, the, phantom, limb, for, ten, minutes, or, so, and, may, be, followed, by, hours, weeks, or, even, longer, of, partial, or, total, relief, from, phantom, pain, vigorous, vibration, or, electrical, stimulation, of, the, stump, or, current, from, electrodes, surgically, implanted, onto, the, spinal, cord, all, produce, relief, in, some, patients, 61, 69, mirror, box, therapy, produces, the, illusion, of, movement, and, touch, in, a, phantom, limb, which, in, turn, may, cause, a, reduction, in, pain, paraplegia, the, loss, of, sensation, and, voluntary, motor, control, after, serious, spinal, cord, damage, may, be, accompanied, by, girdle, pain, at, the, level, of, the, spinal, cord, damage, visceral, pain, evoked, by, a, filling, bladder, or, bowel, or, in, five, to, ten, percent, of, paraplegics, phantom, body, pain, in, areas, of, complete, sensory, loss, this, phantom, body, pain, is, initially, described, as, burning, or, tingling, but, may, evolve, into, severe, crushing, or, pinching, pain, or, the, sensation, of, fire, running, down, the, legs, or, of, a, knife, twisting, in, the, flesh, onset, may, be, immediate, or, may, not, occur, until, years, after, the, disabling, injury, surgical, treatment, rarely, provides, lasting, relief, 61, 69, breakthrough, pain, is, transitory, pain, that, comes, on, suddenly, and, is, not, alleviated, by, the, patient, s, regular, pain, management, it, is, common, in, cancer, patients, who, often, have, background, pain, that, is, generally, well, controlled, by, medications, but, who, also, sometimes, experience, bouts, of, severe, pain, that, from, time, to, time, breaks, through, the, medication, the, characteristics, of, breakthrough, cancer, pain, vary, from, person, to, person, and, according, to, the, cause, management, of, breakthrough, pain, can, entail, intensive, use, of, opioids, including, fentanyl, the, ability, to, experience, pain, is, essential, for, protection, from, injury, and, recognition, of, the, presence, of, injury, episodic, analgesia, may, occur, under, special, circumstances, such, as, in, the, excitement, of, sport, or, war, a, soldier, on, the, battlefield, may, feel, no, pain, for, many, hours, from, a, traumatic, amputation, or, other, severe, injury, although, unpleasantness, is, an, essential, part, of, the, iasp, definition, of, pain, it, is, possible, in, some, patients, to, induce, a, state, known, as, pain, asymbolia, described, as, intense, pain, devoid, of, unpleasantness, with, morphine, injection, or, psychosurgery, such, patients, report, that, they, have, pain, but, are, not, bothered, by, it, they, recognize, the, sensation, of, pain, but, suffer, little, or, not, at, all, indifference, to, pain, can, also, rarely, be, present, from, birth, these, people, have, normal, nerves, on, medical, investigations, and, find, pain, unpleasant, but, do, not, avoid, repetition, of, the, pain, stimulus, insensitivity, to, pain, may, also, result, from, abnormalities, in, the, nervous, system, this, is, usually, the, result, of, acquired, damage, to, the, nerves, such, as, spinal, cord, injury, diabetes, mellitus, diabetic, neuropathy, or, leprosy, in, countries, where, that, disease, is, prevalent, these, individuals, are, at, risk, of, tissue, damage, and, infection, due, to, undiscovered, injuries, people, with, diabetes, related, nerve, damage, for, instance, sustain, poorly, healing, foot, ulcers, as, a, result, of, decreased, sensation, a, much, smaller, number, of, people, are, insensitive, to, pain, due, to, an, inborn, abnormality, of, the, nervous, system, known, as, congenital, insensitivity, to, pain, children, with, this, condition, incur, carelessly, repeated, damage, to, their, tongues, eyes, joints, skin, and, muscles, some, die, before, adulthood, and, others, have, a, reduced, life, expectancy, most, people, with, congenital, insensitivity, to, pain, have, one, of, five, hereditary, sensory, and, autonomic, neuropathies, which, includes, familial, dysautonomia, and, congenital, insensitivity, to, pain, with, anhidrosis, these, conditions, feature, decreased, sensitivity, to, pain, together, with, other, neurological, abnormalities, particularly, of, the, autonomic, nervous, system, a, very, rare, syndrome, with, isolated, congenital, insensitivity, to, pain, has, been, linked, with, mutations, in, the, scn9a, gene, which, codes, for, a, sodium, channel, na, v, 1, 7, necessary, in, conducting, pain, nerve, stimuli, experimental, subjects, challenged, by, acute, pain, and, patients, in, chronic, pain, experience, impairments, in, attention, control, working, memory, capacity, mental, flexibility, problem, solving, and, information, processing, speed, pain, is, also, associated, with, increased, depression, anxiety, fear, and, anger, if, i, have, matters, right, the, consequences, of, pain, will, include, direct, physical, distress, unemployment, financial, difficulties, marital, disharmony, and, difficulties, in, concentration, and, attention, although, pain, is, considered, to, be, aversive, and, unpleasant, and, is, therefore, usually, avoided, a, meta, analysis, which, summarized, and, evaluated, numerous, studies, from, various, psychological, disciplines, found, a, reduction, in, negative, affect, across, studies, participants, that, were, subjected, to, acute, physical, pain, in, the, laboratory, subsequently, reported, feeling, better, than, those, in, non, painful, control, conditions, a, finding, which, was, also, reflected, in, physiological, parameters, a, potential, mechanism, to, explain, this, effect, is, provided, by, the, opponent, process, theory, before, the, relatively, recent, discovery, of, neurons, and, their, role, in, pain, various, different, body, functions, were, proposed, to, account, for, pain, there, were, several, competing, early, theories, of, pain, among, the, ancient, greeks, hippocrates, believed, that, it, was, due, to, an, imbalance, in, vital, fluids, in, the, 11th, century, avicenna, theorized, that, there, were, a, number, of, feeling, senses, including, touch, pain, and, titillation, in, 1644, ren, descartes, theorized, that, pain, was, a, disturbance, that, passed, along, nerve, fibers, until, the, disturbance, reached, the, brain, descartes, work, along, with, avicenna, s, prefigured, the, 19th, century, development, of, specificity, theory, specificity, theory, saw, pain, as, a, specific, sensation, with, its, own, sensory, apparatus, independent, of, touch, and, other, senses, another, theory, that, came, to, prominence, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, was, intensive, theory, which, conceived, of, pain, not, as, a, unique, sensory, modality, but, an, emotional, state, produced, by, stronger, than, normal, stimuli, such, as, intense, light, pressure, or, temperature, by, the, mid, 1890s, specificity, was, backed, mostly, by, physiologists, and, physicians, and, the, intensive, theory, was, mostly, backed, by, psychologists, however, after, a, series, of, clinical, observations, by, henry, head, and, experiments, by, max, von, frey, the, psychologists, migrated, to, specificity, almost, en, masse, and, by, century, s, end, most, textbooks, on, physiology, and, psychology, were, presenting, pain, specificity, as, fact, some, sensory, fibers, do, not, differentiate, between, noxious, and, non, noxious, stimuli, while, others, nociceptors, respond, only, to, noxious, high, intensity, stimuli, at, the, peripheral, end, of, the, nociceptor, noxious, stimuli, generate, currents, that, above, a, given, threshold, send, signals, along, the, nerve, fiber, to, the, spinal, cord, the, specificity, whether, it, responds, to, thermal, chemical, or, mechanical, features, of, its, environment, of, a, nociceptor, is, determined, by, which, ion, channels, it, expresses, at, its, peripheral, end, dozens, of, different, types, of, nociceptor, ion, channels, have, so, far, been, identified, and, their, exact, functions, are, still, being, determined, the, pain, signal, travels, from, the, periphery, to, the, spinal, cord, along, a, delta, and, c, fibers, because, the, a, delta, fiber, is, thicker, than, the, c, fiber, and, is, thinly, sheathed, in, an, electrically, insulating, material, myelin, it, carries, its, signal, faster, 5, 30, m, s, than, the, unmyelinated, c, fiber, 0, 5, 2, m, s, pain, evoked, by, the, a, delta, fibers, is, described, as, sharp, and, is, felt, first, this, is, followed, by, a, duller, pain, often, described, as, burning, carried, by, the, c, fibers, these, a, delta, and, c, fibers, enter, the, spinal, cord, via, lissauer, s, tract, and, connect, with, spinal, cord, nerve, fibers, in, the, central, gelatinous, substance, of, the, spinal, cord, these, spinal, cord, fibers, then, cross, the, cord, via, the, anterior, white, commissure, and, ascend, in, the, spinothalamic, tract, before, reaching, the, brain, the, spinothalamic, tract, splits, into, the, lateral, neospinothalamic, tract, and, the, medial, paleospinothalamic, tract, the, neospinothalamic, tract, carries, the, fast, sharp, a, delta, signal, to, the, ventral, posterolateral, nucleus, of, the, thalamus, the, paleospinothalamic, tract, carries, the, slow, dull, c, fiber, pain, signal, some, of, the, paleospinothalamic, fibers, peel, off, in, the, brain, stem, connecting, with, the, reticular, formation, or, midbrain, periaqueductal, gray, and, the, remainder, terminate, in, the, intralaminar, nuclei, of, the, thalamus, pain, related, activity, in, the, thalamus, spreads, to, the, insular, cortex, thought, to, embody, among, other, things, the, feeling, that, distinguishes, pain, from, other, homeostatic, emotions, such, as, itch, and, nausea, and, anterior, cingulate, cortex, thought, to, embody, among, other, things, the, affective, motivational, element, the, unpleasantness, of, pain, and, pain, that, is, distinctly, located, also, activates, primary, and, secondary, somatosensory, cortex, spinal, cord, fibers, dedicated, to, carrying, a, delta, fiber, pain, signals, and, others, that, carry, both, a, delta, and, c, fiber, pain, signals, to, the, thalamus, have, been, identified, other, spinal, cord, fibers, known, as, wide, dynamic, range, neurons, respond, to, a, delta, and, c, fibers, but, also, to, the, much, larger, more, heavily, myelinated, a, beta, fibers, that, carry, touch, pressure, and, vibration, signals, ronald, melzack, and, patrick, wall, introduced, their, gate, control, theory, in, the, 1965, science, article, pain, mechanisms, a, new, theory, the, authors, proposed, that, the, thin, c, and, a, delta, pain, and, large, diameter, a, beta, touch, pressure, vibration, nerve, fibers, carry, information, from, the, site, of, injury, to, two, destinations, in, the, dorsal, horn, of, the, spinal, cord, and, that, a, beta, fiber, signals, acting, on, inhibitory, cells, in, the, dorsal, horn, can, reduce, the, intensity, of, pain, signals, sent, to, the, brain, in, 1968, ronald, melzack, and, kenneth, casey, described, chronic, pain, in, terms, of, its, three, dimensions, they, theorized, that, pain, intensity, the, sensory, discriminative, dimension, and, unpleasantness, the, affective, motivational, dimension, are, not, simply, determined, by, the, magnitude, of, the, painful, stimulus, but, higher, cognitive, activities, can, influence, perceived, intensity, and, unpleasantness, cognitive, activities, may, affect, both, sensory, and, affective, experience, or, they, may, modify, primarily, the, affective, motivational, dimension, thus, excitement, in, games, or, war, appears, to, block, both, the, sensory, discriminative, and, affective, motivational, dimensions, of, pain, while, suggestion, and, placebos, may, modulate, only, the, affective, motivational, dimension, and, leave, the, sensory, discriminative, dimension, relatively, undisturbed, p, 432, the, paper, ends, with, a, call, to, action, pain, can, be, treated, not, only, by, trying, to, cut, down, the, sensory, input, by, anesthetic, block, surgical, intervention, and, the, like, but, also, by, influencing, the, motivational, affective, and, cognitive, factors, as, well, p, 435, pain, is, part, of, the, body, s, defense, system, producing, a, reflexive, retraction, from, the, painful, stimulus, and, tendencies, to, protect, the, affected, body, part, while, it, heals, and, avoid, that, harmful, situation, in, the, future, it, is, an, important, part, of, animal, life, vital, to, healthy, survival, people, with, congenital, insensitivity, to, pain, have, reduced, life, expectancy, in, the, greatest, show, on, earth, the, evidence, for, evolution, biologist, richard, dawkins, addresses, the, question, of, why, pain, should, have, the, quality, of, being, painful, he, describes, the, alternative, as, a, mental, raising, of, a, red, flag, to, argue, why, that, red, flag, might, be, insufficient, dawkins, argues, that, drives, must, compete, with, one, another, within, living, beings, the, most, fit, creature, would, be, the, one, whose, pains, are, well, balanced, those, pains, which, mean, certain, death, when, ignored, will, become, the, most, powerfully, felt, the, relative, intensities, of, pain, then, may, resemble, the, relative, importance, of, that, risk, to, our, ancestors, this, resemblance, will, not, be, perfect, however, because, natural, selection, can, be, a, poor, designer, this, may, have, maladaptive, results, such, as, supernormal, stimuli, pain, however, does, not, only, wave, a, red, flag, within, living, beings, but, may, also, act, as, a, warning, sign, and, a, call, for, help, to, other, living, beings, especially, in, humans, who, readily, helped, each, other, in, case, of, sickness, or, injury, throughout, their, evolutionary, history, pain, might, be, shaped, by, natural, selection, to, be, a, credible, and, convincing, signal, of, the, need, for, relief, help, and, care, idiopathic, pain, pain, that, persists, after, the, trauma, or, pathology, has, healed, or, that, arises, without, any, apparent, cause, may, be, an, exception, to, the, idea, that, pain, is, helpful, to, survival, although, some, psychodynamic, psychologists, argue, that, such, pain, is, psychogenic, enlisted, as, a, protective, distraction, to, keep, dangerous, emotions, unconscious, in, pain, science, thresholds, are, measured, by, gradually, increasing, the, intensity, of, a, stimulus, in, a, procedure, called, quantitative, sensory, testing, which, involves, such, stimuli, as, electric, current, thermal, heat, or, cold, mechanical, pressure, touch, vibration, ischemic, or, chemical, stimuli, applied, to, the, subject, to, evoke, a, response, the, pain, perception, threshold, is, the, point, at, which, the, subject, begins, to, feel, pain, and, the, pain, threshold, intensity, is, the, stimulus, intensity, at, which, the, stimulus, begins, to, hurt, the, pain, tolerance, threshold, is, reached, when, the, subject, acts, to, stop, the, pain, a, person, s, self, report, is, the, most, reliable, measure, of, pain, some, health, care, professionals, may, underestimate, pain, severity, a, definition, of, pain, widely, employed, in, nursing, emphasizing, its, subjective, nature, and, the, importance, of, believing, patient, reports, was, introduced, by, margo, mccaffery, in, 1968, pain, is, whatever, the, experiencing, person, says, it, is, existing, whenever, he, says, it, does, to, assess, intensity, the, patient, may, be, asked, to, locate, their, pain, on, a, scale, of, 0, to, 10, with, 0, being, no, pain, at, all, and, 10, the, worst, pain, they, have, ever, felt, quality, can, be, established, by, having, the, patient, complete, the, mcgill, pain, questionnaire, indicating, which, words, best, describe, their, pain, the, visual, analogue, scale, is, a, common, reproducible, tool, in, the, assessment, of, pain, and, pain, relief, the, scale, is, a, continuous, line, anchored, by, verbal, descriptors, one, for, each, extreme, of, pain, where, a, higher, score, indicates, greater, pain, intensity, it, is, usually, 10, cm, in, length, with, no, intermediate, descriptors, as, to, avoid, marking, of, scores, around, a, preferred, numeric, value, when, applied, as, a, pain, descriptor, these, anchors, are, often, no, pain, and, worst, imaginable, pain, cut, offs, for, pain, classification, have, been, recommended, as, no, pain, 0, 4mm, mild, pain, 5, 44mm, moderate, pain, 45, 74mm, and, severe, pain, 75, 100mm, the, multidimensional, pain, inventory, mpi, is, a, questionnaire, designed, to, assess, the, psychosocial, state, of, a, person, with, chronic, pain, combining, the, mpi, characterization, of, the, person, with, their, iasp, five, category, pain, profile, is, recommended, for, deriving, the, most, useful, case, description, non, verbal, people, cannot, use, words, to, tell, others, that, they, are, experiencing, pain, however, they, may, be, able, to, communicate, through, other, means, such, as, blinking, pointing, or, nodding, with, a, non, communicative, person, observation, becomes, critical, and, specific, behaviors, can, be, monitored, as, pain, indicators, behaviors, such, as, facial, grimacing, and, guarding, trying, to, protect, part, of, the, body, from, being, bumped, or, touched, indicate, pain, as, well, as, an, increase, or, decrease, in, vocalizations, changes, in, routine, behavior, patterns, and, mental, status, changes, patients, experiencing, pain, may, exhibit, withdrawn, social, behavior, and, possibly, experience, a, decreased, appetite, and, decreased, nutritional, intake, a, change, in, condition, that, deviates, from, baseline, such, as, moaning, with, movement, or, when, manipulating, a, body, part, and, limited, range, of, motion, are, also, potential, pain, indicators, in, patients, who, possess, language, but, are, incapable, of, expressing, themselves, effectively, such, as, those, with, dementia, an, increase, in, confusion, or, display, of, aggressive, behaviors, or, agitation, may, signal, that, discomfort, exists, and, further, assessment, is, necessary, changes, in, behavior, may, be, noticed, by, caregivers, who, are, familiar, with, the, person, s, normal, behavior, infants, do, feel, pain, but, lack, the, language, needed, to, report, it, and, so, communicate, distress, by, crying, a, non, verbal, pain, assessment, should, be, conducted, involving, the, parents, who, will, notice, changes, in, the, infant, which, may, not, be, obvious, to, the, health, care, provider, pre, term, babies, are, more, sensitive, to, painful, stimuli, than, those, carried, to, full, term, another, approach, when, pain, is, suspected, is, to, give, the, person, treatment, for, pain, and, then, watch, to, see, whether, the, suspected, indicators, of, pain, subside, the, way, in, which, one, experiences, and, responds, to, pain, is, related, to, sociocultural, characteristics, such, as, gender, ethnicity, and, age, an, aging, adult, may, not, respond, to, pain, in, the, same, way, that, a, younger, person, might, their, ability, to, recognize, pain, may, be, blunted, by, illness, or, the, use, of, medication, depression, may, also, keep, older, adult, from, reporting, they, are, in, pain, decline, in, self, care, may, also, indicate, the, older, adult, is, experiencing, pain, they, may, be, reluctant, to, report, pain, because, they, do, not, want, to, be, perceived, as, weak, or, may, feel, it, is, impolite, or, shameful, to, complain, or, they, may, feel, the, pain, is, a, form, of, deserved, punishment, cultural, barriers, may, also, affect, the, likelihood, of, reporting, pain, patients, may, feel, that, certain, treatments, go, against, their, religious, beliefs, they, may, not, report, pain, because, they, feel, it, is, a, sign, that, death, is, near, many, people, fear, the, stigma, of, addiction, and, avoid, pain, treatment, so, as, not, to, be, prescribed, potentially, addicting, drugs, many, asians, do, not, want, to, lose, respect, in, society, by, admitting, they, are, in, pain, and, need, help, believing, the, pain, should, be, borne, in, silence, while, other, cultures, feel, they, should, report, pain, immediately, to, receive, immediate, relief, gender, can, also, be, a, perceived, factor, in, reporting, pain, gender, differences, can, be, the, result, of, social, and, cultural, expectations, with, women, expected, to, be, more, emotional, and, show, pain, and, men, more, stoic, as, a, result, female, pain, is, often, stigmatized, leading, to, less, urgent, treatment, of, women, based, on, social, expectations, of, their, ability, to, accurately, report, it, this, leads, to, extended, emergency, room, wait, times, for, women, and, frequent, dismissal, of, their, ability, to, accurately, report, pain, pain, is, a, symptom, of, many, medical, conditions, knowing, the, time, of, onset, location, intensity, pattern, of, occurrence, continuous, intermittent, etc, exacerbating, and, relieving, factors, and, quality, burning, sharp, etc, of, the, pain, will, help, the, examining, physician, to, accurately, diagnose, the, problem, for, example, chest, pain, described, as, extreme, heaviness, may, indicate, myocardial, infarction, while, chest, pain, described, as, tearing, may, indicate, aortic, dissection, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, brain, scanning, has, been, used, to, measure, pain, and, correlates, well, with, self, reported, pain, nociceptive, pain, is, caused, by, stimulation, of, sensory, nerve, fibers, that, respond, to, stimuli, approaching, or, exceeding, harmful, intensity, nociceptors, and, may, be, classified, according, to, the, mode, of, noxious, stimulation, the, most, common, categories, are, thermal, e, g, heat, or, cold, mechanical, e, g, crushing, tearing, shearing, etc, and, chemical, e, g, iodine, in, a, cut, or, chemicals, released, during, inflammation, some, nociceptors, respond, to, more, than, one, of, these, modalities, and, are, consequently, designated, polymodal, nociceptive, pain, may, also, be, classed, according, to, the, site, of, origin, and, divided, into, visceral, deep, somatic, and, superficial, somatic, pain, visceral, structures, e, g, the, heart, liver, and, intestines, are, highly, sensitive, to, stretch, ischemia, and, inflammation, but, relatively, insensitive, to, other, stimuli, that, normally, evoke, pain, in, other, structures, such, as, burning, and, cutting, visceral, pain, is, diffuse, difficult, to, locate, and, often, referred, to, a, distant, usually, superficial, structure, it, may, be, accompanied, by, nausea, and, vomiting, and, may, be, described, as, sickening, deep, squeezing, and, dull, deep, somatic, pain, is, initiated, by, stimulation, of, nociceptors, in, ligaments, tendons, bones, blood, vessels, fasciae, and, muscles, and, is, dull, aching, poorly, localized, pain, examples, include, sprains, and, broken, bones, superficial, somatic, pain, is, initiated, by, activation, of, nociceptors, in, the, skin, or, other, superficial, tissue, and, is, sharp, well, defined, and, clearly, located, examples, of, injuries, that, produce, superficial, somatic, pain, include, minor, wounds, and, minor, first, degree, burns, neuropathic, pain, is, caused, by, damage, or, disease, affecting, any, part, of, the, nervous, system, involved, in, bodily, feelings, the, somatosensory, system, neuropathic, pain, may, be, divided, into, peripheral, central, or, mixed, peripheral, and, central, neuropathic, pain, peripheral, neuropathic, pain, is, often, described, as, burning, tingling, electrical, stabbing, or, pins, and, needles, bumping, the, funny, bone, elicits, acute, peripheral, neuropathic, pain, some, manifestations, of, neuropathic, pain, include, traumatic, neuropathy, tic, douloureux, painful, diabetic, neuropathy, and, postherpetic, neuralgia, nociplastic, pain, is, pain, characterized, by, a, changed, nociception, but, without, evidence, of, real, or, threatened, tissue, damage, or, without, disease, or, damage, in, the, somatosensory, system, psychogenic, pain, also, called, psychalgia, or, somatoform, pain, is, pain, caused, increased, or, prolonged, by, mental, emotional, or, behavioral, factors, headaches, back, pain, and, stomach, pain, are, sometimes, diagnosed, as, psychogenic, those, affected, are, often, stigmatized, because, both, medical, professionals, and, the, general, public, tend, to, think, that, pain, from, a, psychological, source, is, not, real, however, specialists, consider, that, it, is, no, less, actual, or, hurtful, than, pain, from, any, other, source, people, with, long, term, pain, frequently, display, psychological, disturbance, with, elevated, scores, on, the, minnesota, multiphasic, personality, inventory, scales, of, hysteria, depression, and, hypochondriasis, the, neurotic, triad, some, investigators, have, argued, that, it, is, this, neuroticism, that, causes, acute, pain, to, turn, chronic, but, clinical, evidence, points, in, the, other, direction, to, chronic, pain, causing, neuroticism, when, long, term, pain, is, relieved, by, therapeutic, intervention, scores, on, the, neurotic, triad, and, anxiety, fall, often, to, normal, levels, self, esteem, often, low, in, chronic, pain, patients, also, shows, improvement, once, pain, has, resolved, 31, 32, pain, can, be, treated, through, a, variety, of, methods, the, most, appropriate, method, depends, upon, the, situation, management, of, chronic, pain, can, be, difficult, and, may, require, the, coordinated, efforts, of, a, pain, management, team, which, typically, includes, medical, practitioners, clinical, pharmacists, clinical, psychologists, physiotherapists, occupational, therapists, physician, assistants, and, nurse, practitioners, inadequate, treatment, of, pain, is, widespread, throughout, surgical, wards, intensive, care, units, and, accident, and, emergency, departments, in, general, practice, in, the, management, of, all, forms, of, chronic, pain, including, cancer, pain, and, in, end, of, life, care, this, neglect, extends, to, all, ages, from, newborns, to, medically, frail, elderly, in, the, us, african, and, hispanic, americans, are, more, likely, than, others, to, suffer, unnecessarily, while, in, the, care, of, a, physician, and, women, s, pain, is, more, likely, to, be, undertreated, than, men, s, the, international, association, for, the, study, of, pain, advocates, that, the, relief, of, pain, should, be, recognized, as, a, human, right, that, chronic, pain, should, be, considered, a, disease, in, its, own, right, and, that, pain, medicine, should, have, the, full, status, of, a, medical, specialty, it, is, a, specialty, only, in, china, and, australia, at, this, time, elsewhere, pain, medicine, is, a, subspecialty, under, disciplines, such, as, anesthesiology, physiatry, neurology, palliative, medicine, and, psychiatry, in, 2011, human, rights, watch, alerted, that, tens, of, millions, of, people, worldwide, are, still, denied, access, to, inexpensive, medications, for, severe, pain, acute, pain, is, usually, managed, with, medications, such, as, analgesics, and, anesthetics, caffeine, when, added, to, pain, medications, such, as, ibuprofen, may, provide, some, additional, benefit, ketamine, can, be, used, instead, of, opioids, for, short, term, pain, pain, medications, can, cause, paradoxical, side, effects, such, as, opioid,

placebos, are, more, effective, for, intense, pain, than, mild, pain, and, they, produce, progressively, weaker, effects, with, repeated, administration, 26, 28, it, is, possible, for, many, with, chronic, pain, to, become, so, absorbed, in, an, activity, or, entertainment, that, the, pain, is, no, longer, felt, or, is, greatly, diminished, 22, 23, a, number, of, meta, analyses, have, found, clinical, hypnosis, to, be, effective, in, controlling, pain, associated, with, diagnostic, and, surgical, procedures, in, both, adults, and, children, as, well, as, pain, associated, with, cancer, and, childbirth, a, 2007, review, of, 13, studies, found, evidence, for, the, efficacy, of, hypnosis, in, the, reduction, of, chronic, pain, under, some, conditions, though, the, number, of, patients, enrolled, in, the, studies, was, low, raising, issues, related, to, the, statistical, power, to, detect, group, differences, and, most, lacked, credible, controls, for, placebo, or, expectation, the, authors, concluded, that, although, the, findings, provide, support, for, the, general, applicability, of, hypnosis, in, the, treatment, of, chronic, pain, considerably, more, research, will, be, needed, to, fully, determine, the, effects, of, hypnosis, for, different, chronic, pain, conditions, an, analysis, of, the, 13, highest, quality, studies, of, pain, treatment, with, acupuncture, published, in, january, 2009, concluded, there, was, little, difference, in, the, effect, of, real, fake, and, no, acupuncture, however, more, recent, reviews, have, found, some, benefit, additionally, there, is, tentative, evidence, for, a, few, herbal, medicines, for, chronic, long, term, lower, back, pain, spinal, manipulation, produces, tiny, clinically, insignificant, short, term, improvements, in, pain, and, function, compared, with, sham, therapy, and, other, interventions, spinal, manipulation, produces, the, same, outcome, as, other, treatments, such, as, general, practitioner, care, pain, relief, drugs, physical, therapy, and, exercise, for, acute, short, term, lower, back, pain, there, has, been, some, interest, in, the, relationship, between, vitamin, d, and, pain, but, the, evidence, so, far, from, controlled, trials, for, such, a, relationship, other, than, in, osteomalacia, is, inconclusive, the, international, association, for, the, study, of, pain, iasp, says, that, due, to, a, lack, of, evidence, from, high, quality, research, it, does, not, endorse, the, general, use, of, cannabinoids, to, treat, pain, pain, is, the, main, reason, for, visiting, an, emergency, department, in, more, than, 50, of, cases, and, is, present, in, 30, of, family, practice, visits, several, epidemiological, studies, have, reported, widely, varying, prevalence, rates, for, chronic, pain, ranging, from, 12, to, 80, of, the, population, it, becomes, more, common, as, people, approach, death, a, study, of, 4, 703, patients, found, that, 26, had, pain, in, the, last, two, years, of, life, increasing, to, 46, in, the, last, month, a, survey, of, 6, 636, children, 0, 18, years, of, age, found, that, of, the, 5, 424, respondents, 54, had, experienced, pain, in, the, preceding, three, months, a, quarter, reported, having, experienced, recurrent, or, continuous, pain, for, three, months, or, more, and, a, third, of, these, reported, frequent, and, intense, pain, the, intensity, of, chronic, pain, was, higher, for, girls, and, girls, reports, of, chronic, pain, increased, markedly, between, ages, 12, and, 14, physical, pain, is, a, universal, experience, and, a, strong, motivator, of, human, and, animal, behavior, as, such, physical, pain, is, used, politically, in, relation, to, various, issues, such, as, pain, management, policy, drug, control, animal, rights, or, animal, welfare, torture, and, pain, compliance, the, deliberate, infliction, of, pain, and, the, medical, management, of, pain, are, both, important, aspects, of, biopower, a, concept, that, encompasses, the, set, of, mechanisms, through, which, the, basic, biological, features, of, the, human, species, became, the, object, of, a, political, strategy, in, various, contexts, the, deliberate, infliction, of, pain, in, the, form, of, corporal, punishment, is, used, as, retribution, for, an, offence, for, the, purpose, of, disciplining, or, reforming, a, wrongdoer, or, to, deter, attitudes, or, behaviour, deemed, unacceptable, in, western, societies, the, intentional, infliction, of, severe, pain, torture, was, principally, used, to, extract, confession, prior, to, its, abolition, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 19th, century, torture, as, a, means, to, punish, the, citizen, has, been, reserved, for, offences, posing, a, severe, threat, to, the, social, fabric, for, example, treason, the, administration, of, torture, on, bodies, othered, by, the, cultural, narrative, those, observed, as, not, full, members, of, society, 101, 121, met, a, resurgence, in, the, 20th, century, possibly, due, to, the, heightened, warfare, 101, 121, many, cultures, use, painful, ritual, practices, as, a, catalyst, for, psychological, transformation, the, use, of, pain, to, transition, to, a, cleansed, and, purified, state, is, seen, in, religious, self, flagellation, practices, particularly, those, of, christianity, and, islam, or, personal, catharsis, in, neo, primitive, body, suspension, experiences, beliefs, about, pain, play, an, important, role, in, sporting, cultures, pain, may, be, viewed, positively, exemplified, by, the, no, pain, no, gain, attitude, with, pain, seen, as, an, essential, part, of, training, sporting, culture, tends, to, normalise, experiences, of, pain, and, injury, and, celebrate, athletes, who, play, hurt, pain, has, psychological, social, and, physical, dimensions, and, is, greatly, influenced, by, cultural, factors, ren, descartes, argued, that, animals, lack, consciousness, and, therefore, do, not, experience, pain, and, suffering, in, the, way, that, humans, do, bernard, rollin, of, colorado, state, university, the, principal, author, of, two, u, s, federal, laws, regulating, pain, relief, for, animals, wrote, that, researchers, remained, unsure, into, the, 1980s, as, to, whether, animals, experience, pain, and, that, veterinarians, trained, in, the, u, s, before, 1989, were, simply, taught, to, ignore, animal, pain, the, ability, of, invertebrate, species, of, animals, such, as, insects, to, feel, pain, and, suffering, is, unclear, specialists, believe, that, all, vertebrates, can, feel, pain, and, that, certain, invertebrates, like, the, octopus, may, also, the, presence, of, pain, in, animals, is, unknown, but, can, be, inferred, through, physical, and, behavioral, reactions, such, as, paw, withdrawal, from, various, noxious, mechanical, stimuli, in, rodents, while, plants, as, living, beings, can, perceive, and, communicate, physical, stimuli, and, damage, they, do, not, feel, pain, simply, because, of, the, lack, of, any, pain, receptors, nerves, or, a, brain, and, by, extension, a, lack, of, consciousness, many, plants, are, known, to, perceive, and, respond, to, mechanical, stimuli, at, a, cellular, level, and, some, plants, such, as, the, venus, flytrap, or, touch, me, not, are, known, for, their, obvious, sensory, abilities, nevertheless, no, member, of, the, plant, kingdom, does, feel, pain, notwithstanding, their, abilities, to, respond, to, sunlight, gravity, wind, and, any, external, stimuli, such, as, insect, bites, since, they, lack, any, nervous, system, the, primary, reason, for, this, is, that, unlike, the, members, of, the, animal, kingdom, whose, evolutionary, successes, and, failures, are, shaped, by, suffering, the, evolution, of, plants, are, simply, shaped, by, life, and, death
