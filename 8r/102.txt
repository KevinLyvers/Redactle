color, vision, a, feature, of, visual, perception, is, an, ability, to, perceive, differences, between, light, composed, of, different, frequencies, independently, of, light, intensity, color, perception, is, a, part, of, the, larger, visual, system, and, is, mediated, by, a, complex, process, between, neurons, that, begins, with, differential, stimulation, of, different, types, of, photoreceptors, by, light, entering, the, eye, those, photoreceptors, then, emit, outputs, that, are, propagated, through, many, layers, of, neurons, and, then, ultimately, to, the, brain, color, vision, is, found, in, many, animals, and, is, mediated, by, similar, underlying, mechanisms, with, common, types, of, biological, molecules, and, a, complex, history, of, evolution, in, different, animal, taxa, in, primates, color, vision, may, have, evolved, under, selective, pressure, for, a, variety, of, visual, tasks, including, the, foraging, for, nutritious, young, leaves, ripe, fruit, and, flowers, as, well, as, detecting, predator, camouflage, and, emotional, states, in, other, primates, isaac, newton, discovered, that, white, light, after, being, split, into, its, component, colors, when, passed, through, a, dispersive, prism, could, be, recombined, to, make, white, light, by, passing, them, through, a, different, prism, the, visible, light, spectrum, ranges, from, about, 380, to, 740, nanometers, spectral, colors, colors, that, are, produced, by, a, narrow, band, of, wavelengths, such, as, red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and, violet, can, be, found, in, this, range, these, spectral, colors, do, not, refer, to, a, single, wavelength, but, rather, to, a, set, of, wavelengths, red, 625, 740, nm, orange, 590, 625, nm, yellow, 565, 590, nm, green, 500, 565, nm, cyan, 485, 500, nm, blue, 450, 485, nm, violet, 380, 450, nm, wavelengths, longer, or, shorter, than, this, range, are, called, infrared, or, ultraviolet, respectively, humans, cannot, generally, see, these, wavelengths, but, other, animals, may, sufficient, differences, in, wavelength, cause, a, difference, in, the, perceived, hue, the, just, noticeable, difference, in, wavelength, varies, from, about, 1, nm, in, the, blue, green, and, yellow, wavelengths, to, 10, nm, and, more, in, the, longer, red, and, shorter, blue, wavelengths, although, the, human, eye, can, distinguish, up, to, a, few, hundred, hues, when, those, pure, spectral, colors, are, mixed, together, or, diluted, with, white, light, the, number, of, distinguishable, chromaticities, can, be, much, higher, in, very, low, light, levels, vision, is, scotopic, light, is, detected, by, rod, cells, of, the, retina, rods, are, maximally, sensitive, to, wavelengths, near, 500, nm, and, play, little, if, any, role, in, color, vision, in, brighter, light, such, as, daylight, vision, is, photopic, light, is, detected, by, cone, cells, which, are, responsible, for, color, vision, cones, are, sensitive, to, a, range, of, wavelengths, but, are, most, sensitive, to, wavelengths, near, 555, nm, between, these, regions, mesopic, vision, comes, into, play, and, both, rods, and, cones, provide, signals, to, the, retinal, ganglion, cells, the, shift, in, color, perception, from, dim, light, to, daylight, gives, rise, to, differences, known, as, the, purkinje, effect, the, perception, of, white, is, formed, by, the, entire, spectrum, of, visible, light, or, by, mixing, colors, of, just, a, few, wavelengths, in, animals, with, few, types, of, color, receptors, in, humans, white, light, can, be, perceived, by, combining, wavelengths, such, as, red, green, and, blue, or, just, a, pair, of, complementary, colors, such, as, blue, and, yellow, there, are, a, variety, of, colors, in, addition, to, spectral, colors, and, their, hues, these, include, grayscale, colors, shades, of, colors, obtained, by, mixing, grayscale, colors, with, spectral, colors, violet, red, colors, impossible, colors, and, metallic, colors, grayscale, colors, include, white, gray, and, black, rods, contain, rhodopsin, which, reacts, to, light, intensity, providing, grayscale, coloring, shades, include, colors, such, as, pink, or, brown, pink, is, obtained, from, mixing, red, and, white, brown, may, be, obtained, from, mixing, orange, with, gray, or, black, navy, is, obtained, from, mixing, blue, and, black, violet, red, colors, include, hues, and, shades, of, magenta, the, light, spectrum, is, a, line, on, which, violet, is, one, end, and, the, other, is, red, and, yet, we, see, hues, of, purple, that, connect, those, two, colors, impossible, colors, are, a, combination, of, cone, responses, that, cannot, be, naturally, produced, for, example, medium, cones, cannot, be, activated, completely, on, their, own, if, they, were, we, would, see, a, hyper, green, color, color, vision, is, categorized, foremost, according, to, the, dimensionality, of, the, color, gamut, which, is, defined, by, the, number, of, primaries, required, to, represent, the, color, vision, this, is, generally, equal, to, the, number, of, photopsins, expressed, a, correlation, that, holds, for, vertebrates, but, not, invertebrates, the, common, vertebrate, ancestor, possessed, four, photopsins, expressed, in, cones, plus, rhodopsin, expressed, in, rods, so, was, tetrachromatic, however, many, vertebrate, lineages, have, lost, one, or, many, photopsin, genes, leading, to, lower, dimension, color, vision, the, dimensions, of, color, vision, range, from, 1, dimensional, and, up, perception, of, color, begins, with, specialized, retinal, cells, known, as, cone, cells, cone, cells, contain, different, forms, of, opsin, a, pigment, protein, that, have, different, spectral, sensitivities, humans, contain, three, types, resulting, in, trichromatic, color, vision, each, individual, cone, contains, pigments, composed, of, opsin, apoprotein, covalently, linked, to, a, light, absorbing, prosthetic, group, either, 11, cis, hydroretinal, or, more, rarely, 11, cis, dehydroretinal, the, cones, are, conventionally, labeled, according, to, the, ordering, of, the, wavelengths, of, the, peaks, of, their, spectral, sensitivities, short, s, medium, m, and, long, l, cone, types, these, three, types, do, not, correspond, well, to, particular, colors, as, we, know, them, rather, the, perception, of, color, is, achieved, by, a, complex, process, that, starts, with, the, differential, output, of, these, cells, in, the, retina, and, which, is, finalized, in, the, visual, cortex, and, associative, areas, of, the, brain, for, example, while, the, l, cones, have, been, referred, to, simply, as, red, receptors, microspectrophotometry, has, shown, that, their, peak, sensitivity, is, in, the, greenish, yellow, region, of, the, spectrum, similarly, the, s, cones, and, m, cones, do, not, directly, correspond, to, blue, and, green, although, they, are, often, described, as, such, the, rgb, color, model, therefore, is, a, convenient, means, for, representing, color, but, is, not, directly, based, on, the, types, of, cones, in, the, human, eye, the, peak, response, of, human, cone, cells, varies, even, among, individuals, with, so, called, normal, color, vision, in, some, non, human, species, this, polymorphic, variation, is, even, greater, and, it, may, well, be, adaptive, two, complementary, theories, of, color, vision, are, the, trichromatic, theory, and, the, opponent, process, theory, the, trichromatic, theory, or, young, helmholtz, theory, proposed, in, the, 19th, century, by, thomas, young, and, hermann, von, helmholtz, posits, three, types, of, cones, preferentially, sensitive, to, blue, green, and, red, respectively, others, have, suggested, that, the, trichromatic, theory, is, not, specifically, a, theory, of, color, vision, but, a, theory, of, receptors, for, all, vision, including, color, but, not, specific, or, limited, to, it, equally, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, relationship, between, the, phenomenal, opponency, described, by, hering, and, the, physiological, opponent, processes, are, not, straightforward, see, below, making, of, physiological, opponency, a, mechanism, that, is, relevant, to, the, whole, of, vision, and, not, just, to, color, vision, alone, ewald, hering, proposed, the, opponent, process, theory, in, 1872, it, states, that, the, visual, system, interprets, color, in, an, antagonistic, way, red, vs, green, blue, vs, yellow, black, vs, white, both, theories, are, generally, accepted, as, valid, describing, different, stages, in, visual, physiology, visualized, in, the, adjacent, diagram, 168, green, magenta, and, blue, yellow, are, scales, with, mutually, exclusive, boundaries, in, the, same, way, that, there, cannot, exist, a, slightly, negative, positive, number, a, single, eye, cannot, perceive, a, bluish, yellow, or, a, reddish, green, although, these, two, theories, are, both, currently, widely, accepted, theories, past, and, more, recent, work, has, led, to, criticism, of, the, opponent, process, theory, stemming, from, a, number, of, what, are, presented, as, discrepancies, in, the, standard, opponent, process, theory, for, example, the, phenomenon, of, an, after, image, of, complementary, color, can, be, induced, by, fatiguing, the, cells, responsible, for, color, perception, by, staring, at, a, vibrant, color, for, a, length, of, time, and, then, looking, at, a, white, surface, this, phenomenon, of, complementary, colors, demonstrates, cyan, rather, than, green, to, be, the, complement, of, red, and, magenta, rather, than, red, to, be, the, complement, of, green, as, well, as, demonstrating, as, a, consequence, that, the, reddish, green, color, proposed, to, be, impossible, by, opponent, process, theory, is, in, fact, the, color, yellow, although, this, phenomenon, is, more, readily, explained, by, the, trichromatic, theory, explanations, for, the, discrepancy, may, include, alterations, to, the, opponent, process, theory, such, as, redefining, the, opponent, colors, as, red, vs, cyan, to, reflect, this, effect, despite, such, criticisms, both, theories, remain, in, use, a, newer, theory, proposed, by, edwin, h, land, the, retinex, theory, is, based, on, a, demonstration, of, color, constancy, which, shows, that, the, color, of, any, surface, that, is, part, of, a, complex, natural, scene, is, to, a, large, degree, independent, of, the, wavelength, composition, of, the, light, reflected, from, it, also, the, after, image, produced, by, looking, at, a, given, part, of, a, complex, scene, is, also, independent, of, the, wavelength, composition, of, the, light, reflected, from, it, alone, thus, while, the, color, of, the, after, image, produced, by, looking, at, a, green, surface, that, is, reflecting, more, green, middle, wave, than, red, long, wave, light, is, magenta, so, is, the, after, image, of, the, same, surface, when, it, reflects, more, red, than, green, light, when, it, is, still, perceived, as, green, this, would, seem, to, rule, out, an, explanation, of, color, opponency, based, on, retinal, cone, adaptation, according, to, land, s, retinex, theory, color, in, a, natural, scene, depends, upon, the, three, sets, of, cone, cells, red, green, and, blue, separately, perceiving, each, surface, s, relative, lightness, in, the, scene, and, together, with, the, visual, cortex, assigning, color, based, on, comparing, the, lightness, values, perceived, by, each, set, of, cone, cells, a, range, of, wavelengths, of, light, stimulates, each, of, these, receptor, types, to, varying, degrees, the, brain, combines, the, information, from, each, type, of, receptor, to, give, rise, to, different, perceptions, of, different, wavelengths, of, light, cones, and, rods, are, not, evenly, distributed, in, the, human, eye, cones, have, a, high, density, at, the, fovea, and, a, low, density, in, the, rest, of, the, retina, thus, color, information, is, mostly, taken, in, at, the, fovea, humans, have, poor, color, perception, in, their, peripheral, vision, and, much, of, the, color, we, see, in, our, periphery, may, be, filled, in, by, what, our, brains, expect, to, be, there, on, the, basis, of, context, and, memories, however, our, accuracy, of, color, perception, in, the, periphery, increases, with, the, size, of, stimulus, the, opsins, photopigments, present, in, the, l, and, m, cones, are, encoded, on, the, x, chromosome, defective, encoding, of, these, leads, to, the, two, most, common, forms, of, color, blindness, the, opn1lw, gene, which, encodes, the, opsin, present, in, the, l, cones, is, highly, polymorphic, one, study, found, 85, variants, in, a, sample, of, 236, men, a, small, percentage, of, women, may, have, an, extra, type, of, color, receptor, because, they, have, different, alleles, for, the, gene, for, the, l, opsin, on, each, x, chromosome, x, chromosome, inactivation, means, that, while, only, one, opsin, is, expressed, in, each, cone, cell, both, types, may, occur, overall, and, some, women, may, therefore, show, a, degree, of, tetrachromatic, color, vision, variations, in, opn1mw, which, encodes, the, opsin, expressed, in, m, cones, appear, to, be, rare, and, the, observed, variants, have, no, effect, on, spectral, sensitivity, color, processing, begins, at, a, very, early, level, in, the, visual, system, even, within, the, retina, through, initial, color, opponent, mechanisms, both, helmholtz, s, trichromatic, theory, and, hering, s, opponent, process, theory, are, therefore, correct, but, trichromacy, arises, at, the, level, of, the, receptors, and, opponent, processes, arise, at, the, level, of, retinal, ganglion, cells, and, beyond, in, hering, s, theory, opponent, mechanisms, refer, to, the, opposing, color, effect, of, red, green, blue, yellow, and, light, dark, however, in, the, visual, system, it, is, the, activity, of, the, different, receptor, types, that, are, opposed, some, midget, retinal, ganglion, cells, oppose, l, and, m, cone, activity, which, corresponds, loosely, to, red, green, opponency, but, actually, runs, along, an, axis, from, blue, green, to, magenta, small, bistratified, retinal, ganglion, cells, oppose, input, from, the, s, cones, to, input, from, the, l, and, m, cones, this, is, often, thought, to, correspond, to, blue, yellow, opponency, but, actually, runs, along, a, color, axis, from, yellow, green, to, violet, visual, information, is, then, sent, to, the, brain, from, retinal, ganglion, cells, via, the, optic, nerve, to, the, optic, chiasma, a, point, where, the, two, optic, nerves, meet, and, information, from, the, temporal, contralateral, visual, field, crosses, to, the, other, side, of, the, brain, after, the, optic, chiasma, the, visual, tracts, are, referred, to, as, the, optic, tracts, which, enter, the, thalamus, to, synapse, at, the, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, lgn, the, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, is, divided, into, laminae, zones, of, which, there, are, three, types, the, m, laminae, consisting, primarily, of, m, cells, the, p, laminae, consisting, primarily, of, p, cells, and, the, koniocellular, laminae, m, and, p, cells, receive, relatively, balanced, input, from, both, l, and, m, cones, throughout, most, of, the, retina, although, this, seems, to, not, be, the, case, at, the, fovea, with, midget, cells, synapsing, in, the, p, laminae, the, koniocellular, laminae, receives, axons, from, the, small, bistratified, ganglion, cells, after, synapsing, at, the, lgn, the, visual, tract, continues, on, back, to, the, primary, visual, cortex, v1, located, at, the, back, of, the, brain, within, the, occipital, lobe, within, v1, there, is, a, distinct, band, striation, this, is, also, referred, to, as, striate, cortex, with, other, cortical, visual, regions, referred, to, collectively, as, extrastriate, cortex, it, is, at, this, stage, that, color, processing, becomes, much, more, complicated, in, v1, the, simple, three, color, segregation, begins, to, break, down, many, cells, in, v1, respond, to, some, parts, of, the, spectrum, better, than, others, but, this, color, tuning, is, often, different, depending, on, the, adaptation, state, of, the, visual, system, a, given, cell, that, might, respond, best, to, long, wavelength, light, if, the, light, is, relatively, bright, might, then, become, responsive, to, all, wavelengths, if, the, stimulus, is, relatively, dim, because, the, color, tuning, of, these, cells, is, not, stable, some, believe, that, a, different, relatively, small, population, of, neurons, in, v1, is, responsible, for, color, vision, these, specialized, color, cells, often, have, receptive, fields, that, can, compute, local, cone, ratios, such, double, opponent, cells, were, initially, described, in, the, goldfish, retina, by, nigel, daw, their, existence, in, primates, was, suggested, by, david, h, hubel, and, torsten, wiesel, first, demonstrated, by, c, r, michael, and, subsequently, confirmed, by, bevil, conway, as, margaret, livingstone, and, david, hubel, showed, double, opponent, cells, are, clustered, within, localized, regions, of, v1, called, blobs, and, are, thought, to, come, in, two, flavors, red, green, and, blue, yellow, red, green, cells, compare, the, relative, amounts, of, red, green, in, one, part, of, a, scene, with, the, amount, of, red, green, in, an, adjacent, part, of, the, scene, responding, best, to, local, color, contrast, red, next, to, green, modeling, studies, have, shown, that, double, opponent, cells, are, ideal, candidates, for, the, neural, machinery, of, color, constancy, explained, by, edwin, h, land, in, his, retinex, theory, from, the, v1, blobs, color, information, is, sent, to, cells, in, the, second, visual, area, v2, the, cells, in, v2, that, are, most, strongly, color, tuned, are, clustered, in, the, thin, stripes, that, like, the, blobs, in, v1, stain, for, the, enzyme, cytochrome, oxidase, separating, the, thin, stripes, are, interstripes, and, thick, stripes, which, seem, to, be, concerned, with, other, visual, information, like, motion, and, high, resolution, form, neurons, in, v2, then, synapse, onto, cells, in, the, extended, v4, this, area, includes, not, only, v4, but, two, other, areas, in, the, posterior, inferior, temporal, cortex, anterior, to, area, v3, the, dorsal, posterior, inferior, temporal, cortex, and, posterior, teo, area, v4, was, initially, suggested, by, semir, zeki, to, be, exclusively, dedicated, to, color, and, he, later, showed, that, v4, can, be, subdivided, into, subregions, with, very, high, concentrations, of, color, cells, separated, from, each, other, by, zones, with, lower, concentration, of, such, cells, though, even, the, latter, cells, respond, better, to, some, wavelengths, than, to, others, a, finding, confirmed, by, subsequent, studies, the, presence, in, v4, of, orientation, selective, cells, led, to, the, view, that, v4, is, involved, in, processing, both, color, and, form, associated, with, color, but, it, is, worth, noting, that, the, orientation, selective, cells, within, v4, are, more, broadly, tuned, than, their, counterparts, in, v1, v2, and, v3, color, processing, in, the, extended, v4, occurs, in, millimeter, sized, color, modules, called, globs, this, is, the, part, of, the, brain, in, which, color, is, first, processed, into, the, full, range, of, hues, found, in, color, space, anatomical, studies, have, shown, that, neurons, in, extended, v4, provide, input, to, the, inferior, temporal, lobe, it, cortex, is, thought, to, integrate, color, information, with, shape, and, form, although, it, has, been, difficult, to, define, the, appropriate, criteria, for, this, claim, despite, this, murkiness, it, has, been, useful, to, characterize, this, pathway, v1, v2, v4, it, as, the, ventral, stream, or, the, what, pathway, distinguished, from, the, dorsal, stream, where, pathway, that, is, thought, to, analyze, motion, among, other, features, color, is, a, feature, of, visual, perception, by, an, observer, there, is, a, complex, relationship, between, the, wavelengths, of, light, in, the, visual, spectrum, and, human, experiences, of, color, although, most, people, are, assumed, to, have, the, same, mapping, the, philosopher, john, locke, recognized, that, alternatives, are, possible, and, described, one, such, hypothetical, case, with, the, inverted, spectrum, thought, experiment, for, example, someone, with, an, inverted, spectrum, might, experience, green, while, seeing, red, 700, nm, light, and, experience, red, while, seeing, green, 530, nm, light, this, inversion, has, never, been, demonstrated, in, experiment, though, synesthesia, or, ideasthesia, provides, some, atypical, but, illuminating, examples, of, subjective, color, experience, triggered, by, input, that, is, not, even, light, such, as, sounds, or, shapes, the, possibility, of, a, clean, dissociation, between, color, experience, from, properties, of, the, world, reveals, that, color, is, a, subjective, psychological, phenomenon, the, himba, people, have, been, found, to, categorize, colors, differently, from, most, westerners, and, are, able, to, easily, distinguish, close, shades, of, green, barely, discernible, for, most, people, the, himba, have, created, a, very, different, color, scheme, which, divides, the, spectrum, to, dark, shades, zuzu, in, himba, very, light, vapa, vivid, blue, and, green, buru, and, dry, colors, as, an, adaptation, to, their, specific, way, of, life, the, perception, of, color, depends, heavily, on, the, context, in, which, the, perceived, object, is, presented, psychophysical, experiments, have, shown, that, color, is, perceived, before, the, orientation, of, lines, and, directional, motion, by, as, much, as, 40ms, and, 80, ms, respectively, thus, leading, to, a, perceptual, asynchrony, that, is, demonstrable, with, brief, presentation, times, in, color, vision, chromatic, adaptation, refers, to, color, constancy, the, ability, of, the, visual, system, to, preserve, the, appearance, of, an, object, under, a, wide, range, of, light, sources, for, example, a, white, page, under, blue, pink, or, purple, light, will, reflect, mostly, blue, pink, or, purple, light, to, the, eye, respectively, the, brain, however, compensates, for, the, effect, of, lighting, based, on, the, color, shift, of, surrounding, objects, and, is, more, likely, to, interpret, the, page, as, white, under, all, three, conditions, a, phenomenon, known, as, color, constancy, in, color, science, chromatic, adaptation, is, the, estimation, of, the, representation, of, an, object, under, a, different, light, source, from, the, one, in, which, it, was, recorded, a, common, application, is, to, find, a, chromatic, adaptation, transform, cat, that, will, make, the, recording, of, a, neutral, object, appear, neutral, color, balance, while, keeping, other, colors, also, looking, realistic, for, example, chromatic, adaptation, transforms, are, used, when, converting, images, between, icc, profiles, with, different, white, points, adobe, photoshop, for, example, uses, the, bradford, cat, many, species, can, see, light, with, frequencies, outside, the, human, visible, spectrum, bees, and, many, other, insects, can, detect, ultraviolet, light, which, helps, them, to, find, nectar, in, flowers, plant, species, that, depend, on, insect, pollination, may, owe, reproductive, success, to, ultraviolet, colors, and, patterns, rather, than, how, colorful, they, appear, to, humans, birds, too, can, see, into, the, ultraviolet, 300, 400, nm, and, some, have, sex, dependent, markings, on, their, plumage, that, are, visible, only, in, the, ultraviolet, range, many, animals, that, can, see, into, the, ultraviolet, range, however, cannot, see, red, light, or, any, other, reddish, wavelengths, for, example, bees, visible, spectrum, ends, at, about, 590, nm, just, before, the, orange, wavelengths, start, birds, however, can, see, some, red, wavelengths, although, not, as, far, into, the, light, spectrum, as, humans, it, is, a, myth, that, the, common, goldfish, is, the, only, animal, that, can, see, both, infrared, and, ultraviolet, light, their, color, vision, extends, into, the, ultraviolet, but, not, the, infrared, the, basis, for, this, variation, is, the, number, of, cone, types, that, differ, between, species, mammals, in, general, have, a, color, vision, of, a, limited, type, and, usually, have, red, green, color, blindness, with, only, two, types, of, cones, humans, some, primates, and, some, marsupials, see, an, extended, range, of, colors, but, only, by, comparison, with, other, mammals, most, non, mammalian, vertebrate, species, distinguish, different, colors, at, least, as, well, as, humans, and, many, species, of, birds, fish, reptiles, and, amphibians, and, some, invertebrates, have, more, than, three, cone, types, and, probably, superior, color, vision, to, humans, in, most, catarrhini, old, world, monkeys, and, apes, primates, closely, related, to, humans, there, are, three, types, of, color, receptors, known, as, cone, cells, resulting, in, trichromatic, color, vision, these, primates, like, humans, are, known, as, trichromats, many, other, primates, including, new, world, monkeys, and, other, mammals, are, dichromats, which, is, the, general, color, vision, state, for, mammals, that, are, active, during, the, day, i, e, felines, canines, ungulates, nocturnal, mammals, may, have, little, or, no, color, vision, trichromat, non, primate, mammals, are, rare, 174, 175, many, invertebrates, have, color, vision, honeybees, and, bumblebees, have, trichromatic, color, vision, which, is, insensitive, to, red, but, sensitive, to, ultraviolet, osmia, rufa, for, example, possess, a, trichromatic, color, system, which, they, use, in, foraging, for, pollen, from, flowers, in, view, of, the, importance, of, color, vision, to, bees, one, might, expect, these, receptor, sensitivities, to, reflect, their, specific, visual, ecology, for, example, the, types, of, flowers, that, they, visit, however, the, main, groups, of, hymenopteran, insects, excluding, ants, i, e, bees, wasps, and, sawflies, mostly, have, three, types, of, photoreceptor, with, spectral, sensitivities, similar, to, the, honeybee, s, papilio, butterflies, possess, six, types, of, photoreceptors, and, may, have, pentachromatic, vision, the, most, complex, color, vision, system, in, the, animal, kingdom, has, been, found, in, stomatopods, such, as, the, mantis, shrimp, having, between, 12, and, 16, spectral, receptor, types, thought, to, work, as, multiple, dichromatic, units, vertebrate, animals, such, as, tropical, fish, and, birds, sometimes, have, more, complex, color, vision, systems, than, humans, thus, the, many, subtle, colors, they, exhibit, generally, serve, as, direct, signals, for, other, fish, or, birds, and, not, to, signal, mammals, in, bird, vision, tetrachromacy, is, achieved, through, up, to, four, cone, types, depending, on, species, each, single, cone, contains, one, of, the, four, main, types, of, vertebrate, cone, photopigment, lws, mws, rh2, sws2, and, sws1, and, has, a, colored, oil, droplet, in, its, inner, segment, brightly, colored, oil, droplets, inside, the, cones, shift, or, narrow, the, spectral, sensitivity, of, the, cell, pigeons, may, be, pentachromats, reptiles, and, amphibians, also, have, four, cone, types, occasionally, five, and, probably, see, at, least, the, same, number, of, colors, that, humans, do, or, perhaps, more, in, addition, some, nocturnal, geckos, and, frogs, have, the, capability, of, seeing, color, in, dim, light, at, least, some, color, guided, behaviors, in, amphibians, have, also, been, shown, to, be, wholly, innate, developing, even, in, visually, deprived, animals, in, the, evolution, of, mammals, segments, of, color, vision, were, lost, then, for, a, few, species, of, primates, regained, by, gene, duplication, eutherian, mammals, other, than, primates, for, example, dogs, mammalian, farm, animals, generally, have, less, effective, two, receptor, dichromatic, color, perception, systems, which, distinguish, blue, green, and, yellow, but, cannot, distinguish, oranges, and, reds, there, is, some, evidence, that, a, few, mammals, such, as, cats, have, redeveloped, the, ability, to, distinguish, longer, wavelength, colors, in, at, least, a, limited, way, via, one, amino, acid, mutations, in, opsin, genes, the, adaptation, to, see, reds, is, particularly, important, for, primate, mammals, since, it, leads, to, the, identification, of, fruits, and, also, newly, sprouting, reddish, leaves, which, are, particularly, nutritious, however, even, among, primates, full, color, vision, differs, between, new, world, and, old, world, monkeys, old, world, primates, including, monkeys, and, all, apes, have, vision, similar, to, humans, new, world, monkeys, may, or, may, not, have, color, sensitivity, at, this, level, in, most, species, males, are, dichromats, and, about, 60, of, females, are, trichromats, but, the, owl, monkeys, are, cone, monochromats, and, both, sexes, of, howler, monkeys, are, trichromats, visual, sensitivity, differences, between, males, and, females, in, a, single, species, is, due, to, the, gene, for, yellow, green, sensitive, opsin, protein, which, confers, ability, to, differentiate, red, from, green, residing, on, the, x, sex, chromosome, several, marsupials, such, as, the, fat, tailed, dunnart, sminthopsis, crassicaudata, have, trichromatic, color, vision, marine, mammals, adapted, for, low, light, vision, have, only, a, single, cone, type, and, are, thus, monochromats, color, perception, mechanisms, are, highly, dependent, on, evolutionary, factors, of, which, the, most, prominent, is, thought, to, be, satisfactory, recognition, of, food, sources, in, herbivorous, primates, color, perception, is, essential, for, finding, proper, immature, leaves, in, hummingbirds, particular, flower, types, are, often, recognized, by, color, as, well, on, the, other, hand, nocturnal, mammals, have, less, developed, color, vision, since, adequate, light, is, needed, for, cones, to, function, properly, there, is, evidence, that, ultraviolet, light, plays, a, part, in, color, perception, in, many, branches, of, the, animal, kingdom, especially, insects, in, general, the, optical, spectrum, encompasses, the, most, common, electronic, transitions, in, the, matter, and, is, therefore, the, most, useful, for, collecting, information, about, the, environment, the, evolution, of, trichromatic, color, vision, in, primates, occurred, as, the, ancestors, of, modern, monkeys, apes, and, humans, switched, to, diurnal, daytime, activity, and, began, consuming, fruits, and, leaves, from, flowering, plants, color, vision, with, uv, discrimination, is, also, present, in, a, number, of, arthropods, the, only, terrestrial, animals, besides, the, vertebrates, to, possess, this, trait, some, animals, can, distinguish, colors, in, the, ultraviolet, spectrum, the, uv, spectrum, falls, outside, the, human, visible, range, except, for, some, cataract, surgery, patients, birds, turtles, lizards, many, fish, and, some, rodents, have, uv, receptors, in, their, retinas, these, animals, can, see, the, uv, patterns, found, on, flowers, and, other, wildlife, that, are, otherwise, invisible, to, the, human, eye, ultraviolet, vision, is, an, especially, important, adaptation, in, birds, it, allows, birds, to, spot, small, prey, from, a, distance, navigate, avoid, predators, and, forage, while, flying, at, high, speeds, birds, also, utilize, their, broad, spectrum, vision, to, recognize, other, birds, and, in, sexual, selection, a, physical, color, is, a, combination, of, pure, spectral, colors, in, the, visible, range, in, principle, there, exist, infinitely, many, distinct, spectral, colors, and, so, the, set, of, all, physical, colors, may, be, thought, of, as, an, infinite, dimensional, vector, space, a, hilbert, space, this, space, is, typically, notated, h, color, more, technically, the, space, of, physical, colors, may, be, considered, to, be, the, topological, cone, over, the, simplex, whose, vertices, are, the, spectral, colors, with, white, at, the, centroid, of, the, simplex, black, at, the, apex, of, the, cone, and, the, monochromatic, color, associated, with, any, given, vertex, somewhere, along, the, line, from, that, vertex, to, the, apex, depending, on, its, brightness, an, element, c, of, h, color, is, a, function, from, the, range, of, visible, wavelengths, considered, as, an, interval, of, real, numbers, to, the, real, numbers, assigning, to, each, wavelength, w, in, its, intensity, c, w, a, humanly, perceived, color, may, be, modeled, as, three, numbers, the, extents, to, which, each, of, the, 3, types, of, cones, is, stimulated, thus, a, humanly, perceived, color, may, be, thought, of, as, a, point, in, 3, dimensional, euclidean, space, we, call, this, space, r, 3, color, since, each, wavelength, w, stimulates, each, of, the, 3, types, of, cone, cells, to, a, known, extent, these, extents, may, be, represented, by, 3, functions, s, w, m, w, l, w, corresponding, to, the, response, of, the, s, m, and, l, cone, cells, respectively, finally, since, a, beam, of, light, can, be, composed, of, many, different, wavelengths, to, determine, the, extent, to, which, a, physical, color, c, in, h, color, stimulates, each, cone, cell, we, must, calculate, the, integral, with, respect, to, w, over, the, interval, of, c, w, s, w, of, c, w, m, w, and, of, c, w, l, w, the, triple, of, resulting, numbers, associates, with, each, physical, color, c, which, is, an, element, in, h, color, a, particular, perceived, color, which, is, a, single, point, in, r, 3, color, this, association, is, easily, seen, to, be, linear, it, may, also, easily, be, seen, that, many, different, elements, in, the, physical, space, h, color, can, all, result, in, the, same, single, perceived, color, in, r, 3, color, so, a, perceived, color, is, not, unique, to, one, physical, color, thus, human, color, perception, is, determined, by, a, specific, non, unique, linear, mapping, from, the, infinite, dimensional, hilbert, space, h, color, to, the, 3, dimensional, euclidean, space, r, 3, color, technically, the, image, of, the, mathematical, cone, over, the, simplex, whose, vertices, are, the, spectral, colors, by, this, linear, mapping, is, also, a, mathematical, cone, in, r, 3, color, moving, directly, away, from, the, vertex, of, this, cone, represents, maintaining, the, same, chromaticity, while, increasing, its, intensity, taking, a, cross, section, of, this, cone, yields, a, 2d, chromaticity, space, both, the, 3d, cone, and, its, projection, or, cross, section, are, convex, sets, that, is, any, mixture, of, spectral, colors, is, also, a, color, in, practice, it, would, be, quite, difficult, to, physiologically, measure, an, individual, s, three, cone, responses, to, various, physical, color, stimuli, instead, a, psychophysical, approach, is, taken, three, specific, benchmark, test, lights, are, typically, used, let, us, call, them, s, m, and, l, to, calibrate, human, perceptual, space, scientists, allowed, human, subjects, to, try, to, match, any, physical, color, by, turning, dials, to, create, specific, combinations, of, intensities, i, s, i, m, i, l, for, the, s, m, and, l, lights, resp, until, a, match, was, found, this, needed, only, to, be, done, for, physical, colors, that, are, spectral, since, a, linear, combination, of, spectral, colors, will, be, matched, by, the, same, linear, combination, of, their, i, s, i, m, i, l, matches, note, that, in, practice, often, at, least, one, of, s, m, l, would, have, to, be, added, with, some, intensity, to, the, physical, test, color, and, that, combination, matched, by, a, linear, combination, of, the, remaining, 2, lights, across, different, individuals, without, color, blindness, the, matchings, turned, out, to, be, nearly, identical, by, considering, all, the, resulting, combinations, of, intensities, i, s, i, m, i, l, as, a, subset, of, 3, space, a, model, for, human, perceptual, color, space, is, formed, note, that, when, one, of, s, m, l, had, to, be, added, to, the, test, color, its, intensity, was, counted, as, negative, again, this, turns, out, to, be, a, mathematical, cone, not, a, quadric, but, rather, all, rays, through, the, origin, in, 3, space, passing, through, a, certain, convex, set, again, this, cone, has, the, property, that, moving, directly, away, from, the, origin, corresponds, to, increasing, the, intensity, of, the, s, m, l, lights, proportionately, again, a, cross, section, of, this, cone, is, a, planar, shape, that, is, by, definition, the, space, of, chromaticities, informally, distinct, colors, one, particular, such, cross, section, corresponding, to, constant, x, y, z, of, the, cie, 1931, color, space, gives, the, cie, chromaticity, diagram, this, system, implies, that, for, any, hue, or, non, spectral, color, not, on, the, boundary, of, the, chromaticity, diagram, there, are, infinitely, many, distinct, physical, spectra, that, are, all, perceived, as, that, hue, or, color, so, in, general, there, is, no, such, thing, as, the, combination, of, spectral, colors, that, we, perceive, as, say, a, specific, version, of, tan, instead, there, are, infinitely, many, possibilities, that, produce, that, exact, color, the, boundary, colors, that, are, pure, spectral, colors, can, be, perceived, only, in, response, to, light, that, is, purely, at, the, associated, wavelength, while, the, boundary, colors, on, the, line, of, purples, can, each, only, be, generated, by, a, specific, ratio, of, the, pure, violet, and, the, pure, red, at, the, ends, of, the, visible, spectral, colors, the, cie, chromaticity, diagram, is, horseshoe, shaped, with, its, curved, edge, corresponding, to, all, spectral, colors, the, spectral, locus, and, the, remaining, straight, edge, corresponding, to, the, most, saturated, purples, mixtures, of, red, and, violet
