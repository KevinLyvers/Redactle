cestoda, is, a, class, of, parasitic, worms, in, the, flatworm, phylum, platyhelminthes, most, of, the, species, and, the, best, known, are, those, in, the, subclass, eucestoda, they, are, ribbon, like, worms, as, adults, known, as, tapeworms, their, bodies, consist, of, many, similar, units, known, as, proglottids, essentially, packages, of, eggs, which, are, regularly, shed, into, the, environment, to, infect, other, organisms, species, of, the, other, subclass, cestodaria, are, mainly, fish, infecting, parasites, all, cestodes, are, parasitic, many, have, complex, life, histories, including, a, stage, in, a, definitive, main, host, in, which, the, adults, grow, and, reproduce, often, for, years, and, one, or, two, intermediate, stages, in, which, the, larvae, develop, in, other, hosts, typically, the, adults, live, in, the, digestive, tracts, of, vertebrates, while, the, larvae, often, live, in, the, bodies, of, other, animals, either, vertebrates, or, invertebrates, for, example, diphyllobothrium, has, at, least, two, intermediate, hosts, a, crustacean, and, then, one, or, more, freshwater, fish, its, definitive, host, is, a, mammal, some, cestodes, are, host, specific, while, others, are, parasites, of, a, wide, variety, of, hosts, some, six, thousand, species, have, been, described, probably, all, vertebrates, can, host, at, least, one, species, the, adult, tapeworm, has, a, scolex, head, a, short, neck, and, a, strobila, segmented, body, formed, of, proglottids, tapeworms, anchor, themselves, to, the, inside, of, the, intestine, of, their, host, using, their, scolex, which, typically, has, hooks, suckers, or, both, they, have, no, mouth, but, absorb, nutrients, directly, from, the, host, s, gut, the, neck, continually, produces, proglottids, each, one, containing, a, reproductive, tract, mature, proglottids, are, full, of, eggs, and, fall, off, to, leave, the, host, either, passively, in, the, feces, or, actively, moving, all, tapeworms, are, hermaphrodites, with, each, individual, having, both, male, and, female, reproductive, organs, humans, are, subject, to, infection, by, several, species, of, tapeworms, if, they, eat, undercooked, meat, such, as, pork, taenia, solium, beef, t, saginata, and, fish, diphyllobothrium, or, if, they, live, in, or, eat, food, prepared, in, conditions, of, poor, hygiene, hymenolepis, or, echinococcus, species, the, unproven, concept, of, using, tapeworms, as, a, slimming, aid, has, been, touted, since, around, 1900, all, 6, 000, species, of, cestoda, are, parasites, mainly, intestinal, their, definitive, hosts, are, vertebrates, both, terrestrial, and, marine, while, their, intermediate, hosts, include, insects, crustaceans, molluscs, and, annelids, as, well, as, other, vertebrates, t, saginata, the, beef, tapeworm, can, grow, up, to, 20, m, 65, ft, the, largest, species, the, whale, tapeworm, tetragonoporus, calyptocephalus, can, grow, to, over, 30, m, 100, ft, species, with, small, hosts, tend, to, be, small, for, example, vole, and, lemming, tapeworms, are, only, 13, 240, mm, 0, 5, 9, 4, in, in, length, and, those, parasitizing, shrews, only, 0, 8, 60, mm, 0, 03, 2, 36, in, cestodes, have, no, gut, or, mouth, and, absorb, nutrients, from, the, host, s, alimentary, tract, through, their, specialised, neodermal, cuticle, or, tegument, through, which, gas, exchange, also, takes, place, the, tegument, also, protects, the, parasite, from, the, host, s, digestive, enzymes, and, allows, it, to, transfer, molecules, back, to, the, host, the, body, form, of, adult, eucestodes, is, simple, with, a, scolex, or, grasping, head, adapted, for, attachment, to, the, definitive, host, a, short, neck, and, a, strobila, or, segmented, trunk, formed, of, proglottids, which, makes, up, the, worm, s, body, members, of, the, subclass, cestodaria, the, amphilinidea, and, gyrocotylidea, are, wormlike, but, not, divided, into, proglottids, amphilinids, have, a, muscular, proboscis, at, the, front, end, gyrocotylids, have, a, sucker, or, proboscis, which, they, can, pull, inside, or, push, outside, at, the, front, end, and, a, holdfast, rosette, at, the, posterior, end, the, cestodaria, have, 10, larval, hooks, while, eucestoda, have, 6, larval, hooks, the, scolex, which, attaches, to, the, intestine, of, the, definitive, host, is, often, minute, in, comparison, with, the, proglottids, it, is, typically, a, four, sided, knob, armed, with, suckers, or, hooks, or, both, in, some, species, the, scolex, is, dominated, by, bothria, or, sucking, grooves, that, function, like, suction, cups, cyclophyllid, cestodes, can, be, identified, by, the, presence, of, four, suckers, on, their, scolices, other, species, have, ruffled, or, leaflike, scolices, and, there, may, be, other, structures, to, aid, attachment, in, the, larval, stage, the, scolex, is, similarly, shaped, and, is, known, as, the, protoscoleces, circular, and, longitudinal, muscles, lie, under, the, neodermis, beneath, which, further, longitudinal, dorso, ventral, and, transverse, muscles, surround, the, central, parenchyma, protonephridial, cells, drain, into, the, parenchyma, there, are, four, longitudinal, collection, canals, two, dorso, lateral, and, two, ventro, lateral, running, along, the, length, of, the, worm, with, a, transverse, canal, linking, the, ventral, ones, at, the, posterior, of, each, segment, when, the, proglottids, begin, to, detach, these, canals, open, to, the, exterior, through, the, terminal, segment, the, main, nerve, centre, of, a, cestode, is, a, cerebral, ganglion, in, its, scolex, nerves, emanate, from, the, ganglion, to, supply, the, general, body, muscular, and, sensory, endings, with, two, lateral, nerve, cords, running, the, length, of, the, strobila, the, cirrus, and, vagina, are, innervated, and, sensory, endings, around, the, genital, pore, are, more, plentiful, than, in, other, areas, sensory, function, includes, both, tactoreception, touch, and, chemoreception, smell, or, taste, once, anchored, to, the, host, s, intestinal, wall, tapeworms, absorb, nutrients, through, their, surface, as, their, food, flows, past, them, cestodes, are, unable, to, synthesise, lipids, which, they, use, for, reproduction, and, are, therefore, entirely, dependent, on, their, hosts, the, tapeworm, body, is, composed, of, a, series, of, segments, called, proglottids, these, are, produced, from, the, neck, by, mitotic, growth, which, is, followed, by, transverse, constriction, the, segments, become, larger, and, more, mature, as, they, are, displaced, backwards, by, newer, segments, each, proglottid, contains, an, independent, reproductive, tract, and, like, some, other, flatworms, cestodes, excrete, waste, through, flame, cells, protonephridia, located, in, the, proglottids, the, sum, of, the, proglottids, is, called, a, strobila, which, is, thin, and, resembles, a, strip, of, tape, from, this, is, derived, the, common, name, tapeworm, proglottids, are, continually, being, produced, by, the, neck, region, of, the, scolex, as, long, as, the, scolex, is, attached, and, alive, mature, proglottids, are, essentially, bags, of, eggs, each, of, which, is, infective, to, the, proper, intermediate, host, they, are, released, and, leave, the, host, in, feces, or, migrate, outwards, as, independent, motile, proglottids, the, number, of, proglottids, forming, the, tapeworm, ranges, from, three, to, four, thousand, their, layout, comes, in, two, forms, craspedote, meaning, any, given, proglottid, is, overlapped, by, the, previous, proglottid, or, acraspedote, indicating, the, proglottids, do, not, overlap, cestodes, are, exclusively, hermaphrodites, with, both, male, and, female, reproductive, systems, in, each, body, the, reproductive, system, includes, one, or, more, testes, cirri, vas, deferens, and, seminal, vesicles, as, male, organs, and, a, single, lobed, or, unlobed, ovary, with, the, connecting, oviduct, and, uterus, as, female, organs, the, common, external, opening, for, both, male, and, female, reproductive, systems, is, known, as, the, genital, pore, which, is, situated, at, the, surface, opening, of, the, cup, shaped, atrium, though, they, are, sexually, hermaphroditic, and, cross, fertilization, is, the, norm, self, fertilization, sometimes, occurs, and, makes, possible, the, reproduction, of, a, worm, when, it, is, the, only, individual, in, its, host, s, gut, during, copulation, the, cirri, of, one, individual, connect, with, those, of, the, other, through, the, genital, pore, and, then, spermatozoa, are, exchanged, cestodes, are, parasites, of, vertebrates, with, each, species, infecting, a, single, definitive, host, or, group, of, closely, related, host, species, all, but, amphilinids, and, gyrocotylids, which, burrow, through, the, gut, or, body, wall, to, reach, the, coelom, are, intestinal, though, some, life, cycle, stages, rest, in, muscle, or, other, tissues, the, definitive, host, is, always, a, vertebrate, but, in, nearly, all, cases, one, or, more, intermediate, hosts, are, involved, in, the, life, cycle, typically, arthropods, or, other, vertebrates, infections, can, be, long, lasting, in, humans, tapeworm, infection, may, last, as, much, as, 30, years, no, asexual, phases, occur, in, the, life, cycle, as, they, do, in, other, flatworms, but, the, life, cycle, pattern, has, been, a, crucial, criterion, for, assessing, evolution, among, platyhelminthes, cestodes, produce, large, numbers, of, eggs, but, each, one, has, a, low, probability, of, finding, a, host, to, increase, their, chances, different, species, have, adopted, various, strategies, of, egg, release, in, the, pseudophyllidea, many, eggs, are, released, in, the, brief, period, when, their, aquatic, intermediate, hosts, are, abundant, semelparity, in, contrast, in, the, terrestrial, cyclophyllidea, proglottids, are, released, steadily, over, a, period, of, years, or, as, long, as, their, host, lives, iteroparity, another, strategy, is, to, have, very, long, lived, larvae, for, example, in, echinococcus, the, hydatid, larvae, can, survive, for, ten, years, or, more, in, humans, and, other, vertebrate, hosts, giving, the, tapeworm, an, exceptionally, long, time, window, in, which, to, find, another, host, many, tapeworms, have, a, two, phase, life, cycle, with, two, types, of, host, the, adult, taenia, saginata, lives, in, the, gut, of, a, primate, such, as, a, human, its, definitive, host, proglottids, leave, the, body, through, the, anus, and, fall, to, the, ground, where, they, may, be, eaten, with, grass, by, a, grazing, animal, such, as, a, cow, this, animal, then, becomes, an, intermediate, host, the, oncosphere, boring, through, the, gut, wall, and, migrating, to, another, part, of, the, body, such, as, the, muscle, here, it, encysts, forming, a, cysticercus, the, parasite, completes, its, life, cycle, when, the, intermediate, host, passes, on, the, parasite, to, the, definitive, host, usually, when, the, definitive, host, eats, contaminated, parts, of, the, intermediate, host, for, example, a, human, eating, raw, or, undercooked, meat, another, two, phase, life, cycle, is, exhibited, by, anoplocephala, perfoliata, the, definitive, host, being, an, equine, and, the, intermediate, host, an, oribatid, mite, diphyllobothrium, exhibits, a, more, complex, three, phase, life, cycle, if, the, eggs, are, laid, in, water, they, develop, into, free, swimming, oncosphere, larvae, after, ingestion, by, a, suitable, freshwater, crustacean, such, as, a, copepod, the, first, intermediate, host, they, develop, into, procercoid, larvae, when, the, copepod, is, eaten, by, a, suitable, second, intermediate, host, typically, a, minnow, or, other, small, freshwater, fish, the, procercoid, larvae, migrate, into, the, fish, s, flesh, where, they, develop, into, plerocercoid, larvae, these, are, the, infective, stages, for, the, mammalian, definitive, host, if, the, small, fish, is, eaten, by, a, predatory, fish, its, muscles, too, can, become, infected, schistocephalus, solidus, is, another, three, phase, example, the, intermediate, hosts, are, copepods, and, small, fish, and, the, definitive, hosts, are, waterbirds, this, species, has, been, used, to, demonstrate, that, cross, fertilisation, produces, a, higher, infective, success, rate, than, self, fertilisation, hosts, can, become, immune, to, infection, by, a, cestode, if, the, lining, the, mucosa, of, the, gut, is, damaged, this, exposes, the, host, s, immune, system, to, cestode, antigens, enabling, the, host, to, mount, an, antibody, defence, host, antibodies, can, kill, or, limit, cestode, infection, by, damaging, their, digestive, enzymes, which, reduces, their, ability, to, feed, and, therefore, to, grow, and, to, reproduce, by, binding, to, their, bodies, and, by, neutralising, toxins, that, they, produce, when, cestodes, feed, passively, in, the, gut, they, do, not, provoke, an, antibody, reaction, parasite, fossils, are, rare, but, recognizable, clusters, of, cestode, eggs, some, with, an, operculum, lid, indicating, that, they, had, not, erupted, one, with, a, developing, larva, have, been, discovered, in, fossil, shark, coprolites, dating, to, the, permian, some, 270, million, years, ago, the, fossil, rugosusivitta, which, was, found, in, china, at, base, of, the, cambrian, deposits, in, yunnan, just, above, the, ediacaran, cambrian, border, has, great, similarities, to, present, day, cestodians, if, correct, this, would, be, the, earliest, example, of, a, platyzoan, and, also, one, of, the, earliest, bilaterian, body, fossils, and, might, thus, provide, an, insight, to, the, living, mode, of, cestodians, before, they, became, specialized, parasites, the, position, of, the, cestoda, within, the, platyhelminthes, and, other, spiralian, phyla, based, on, genomic, analysis, is, shown, in, the, phylogenetic, tree, the, non, parasitic, flatworms, traditionally, grouped, as, the, turbellaria, are, paraphyletic, as, the, parasitic, neodermata, including, the, cestoda, arose, within, that, grouping, the, approximate, times, when, major, groups, first, appeared, is, shown, in, millions, of, years, ago, gastrotricha, turbellaria, mollusca, annelida, the, evolutionary, history, of, the, cestoda, has, been, studied, using, ribosomal, rna, mitochondrial, and, other, dna, and, morphological, analysis, and, continues,

orders, of, the, cyclophyllidea, like, other, species, of, mammal, humans, can, become, infected, with, tapeworms, there, may, be, few, or, no, symptoms, and, the, first, indication, of, the, infection, may, be, the, presence, of, one, or, more, proglottids, in, the, stools, the, proglottids, appear, as, flat, rectangular, whitish, objects, about, the, size, of, a, grain, of, rice, which, may, change, size, or, move, about, bodily, symptoms, which, are, sometimes, present, include, abdominal, pain, nausea, diarrhea, increased, appetite, and, weight, loss, there, are, several, classes, of, anthelminthic, drugs, some, effective, against, many, kinds, of, parasite, others, more, specific, these, can, be, used, both, preventatively, and, to, treat, infections, for, example, praziquantel, is, an, effective, treatment, for, tapeworm, infection, and, is, preferred, over, the, older, niclosamide, while, accidental, tapeworm, infections, in, developed, countries, are, quite, rare, such, infections, are, more, likely, to, occur, in, countries, with, poor, sanitation, facilities, or, where, food, hygiene, standards, are, low, in, ancient, greece, the, comic, playwright,
