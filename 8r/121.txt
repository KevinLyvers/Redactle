the, uterus, from, latin, uterus, pl, uteri, or, womb, w, u, m, is, the, organ, in, the, reproductive, system, of, most, female, mammals, including, humans, that, accommodates, the, embryonic, and, fetal, development, of, one, or, more, embryos, until, birth, the, uterus, is, a, hormone, responsive, sex, organ, that, contains, glands, in, its, lining, that, secrete, uterine, milk, for, embryonic, nourishment, the, term, uterus, is, also, applied, to, analogous, structures, in, some, non, mammalian, animals, in, the, human, the, lower, end, of, the, uterus, is, a, narrow, part, known, as, the, isthmus, that, connects, to, the, cervix, leading, to, the, vagina, the, upper, end, the, body, of, the, uterus, is, connected, to, the, fallopian, tubes, at, the, uterine, horns, and, the, rounded, part, above, the, openings, to, the, fallopian, tubes, is, the, fundus, the, connection, of, the, uterine, cavity, with, a, fallopian, tube, is, called, the, uterotubal, junction, the, fertilized, egg, is, carried, to, the, uterus, along, the, fallopian, tube, it, will, have, divided, on, its, journey, to, form, a, blastocyst, that, will, implant, itself, into, the, lining, of, the, uterus, the, endometrium, where, it, will, receive, nutrients, and, develop, into, the, embryo, proper, and, later, fetus, for, the, duration, of, the, pregnancy, in, the, human, embryo, the, uterus, develops, from, the, paramesonephric, ducts, which, fuse, into, the, single, organ, known, as, a, simplex, uterus, the, uterus, has, different, forms, in, many, other, animals, and, in, some, it, exists, as, two, separate, uteri, known, as, a, duplex, uterus, in, medicine, and, related, professions, the, term, uterus, is, consistently, used, while, the, germanic, derived, term, womb, is, commonly, used, in, everyday, contexts, events, occurring, within, the, uterus, are, described, with, the, term, in, utero, in, humans, the, uterus, is, located, within, the, pelvic, region, immediately, behind, and, almost, overlying, the, bladder, and, in, front, of, the, sigmoid, colon, the, human, uterus, is, pear, shaped, and, about, 7, 6, cm, 3, 0, in, long, 4, 5, cm, 1, 8, in, broad, side, to, side, and, 3, 0, cm, 1, 2, in, thick, a, typical, adult, uterus, weighs, about, 60, grams, the, uterus, can, be, divided, anatomically, into, four, regions, the, fundus, the, uppermost, rounded, portion, of, the, uterus, above, the, openings, of, the, fallopian, tubes, the, body, the, cervix, and, the, cervical, canal, the, cervix, protrudes, into, the, vagina, the, uterus, is, held, in, position, within, the, pelvis, by, ligaments, which, are, part, of, the, endopelvic, fascia, these, ligaments, include, the, pubocervical, ligaments, the, cardinal, ligaments, and, the, uterosacral, ligaments, it, is, covered, by, a, sheet, like, fold, of, peritoneum, the, broad, ligament, the, uterus, has, three, layers, which, together, form, the, uterine, wall, from, innermost, to, outermost, these, layers, are, the, endometrium, myometrium, and, perimetrium, the, endometrium, is, the, inner, epithelial, layer, along, with, its, mucous, membrane, of, the, mammalian, uterus, it, has, a, basal, layer, and, a, functional, layer, the, functional, layer, thickens, and, then, is, shed, during, the, menstrual, cycle, or, estrous, cycle, during, pregnancy, the, uterine, glands, and, blood, vessels, in, the, endometrium, further, increase, in, size, and, number, and, form, the, decidua, vascular, spaces, fuse, and, become, interconnected, forming, the, placenta, which, supplies, oxygen, and, nutrition, to, the, embryo, and, fetus, the, myometrium, of, the, uterus, mostly, consists, of, smooth, muscle, the, innermost, layer, of, myometrium, is, known, as, the, junctional, zone, which, becomes, thickened, in, adenomyosis, the, perimetrium, is, a, serous, layer, of, visceral, peritoneum, it, covers, the, outer, surface, of, the, uterus, surrounding, the, uterus, is, a, layer, or, band, of, fibrous, and, fatty, connective, tissue, called, the, parametrium, that, connects, the, uterus, to, other, tissues, of, the, pelvis, commensal, and, mutualistic, organisms, are, present, in, the, uterus, and, form, the, uterine, microbiome, the, uterus, is, primarily, supported, by, the, pelvic, diaphragm, perineal, body, and, urogenital, diaphragm, secondarily, it, is, supported, by, ligaments, including, the, peritoneal, ligament, and, the, broad, ligament, of, uterus, the, uterus, is, held, in, place, by, several, peritoneal, ligaments, of, which, the, following, are, the, most, important, there, are, two, of, each, normally, the, human, uterus, lies, in, anteversion, and, anteflexion, in, most, women, the, long, axis, of, the, uterus, is, bent, forward, on, the, long, axis, of, the, vagina, against, the, urinary, bladder, this, position, is, referred, to, as, anteversion, of, the, uterus, furthermore, the, long, axis, of, the, body, of, the, uterus, is, bent, forward, at, the, level, of, the, internal, os, with, the, long, axis, of, the, cervix, this, position, is, termed, anteflexion, of, the, uterus, the, uterus, assumes, an, anteverted, position, in, 50, of, women, a, retroverted, position, in, 25, of, women, and, a, midposed, position, in, the, remaining, 25, of, women, the, uterus, is, located, in, the, middle, of, the, pelvic, cavity, in, the, frontal, plane, due, to, the, broad, ligament, of, the, uterus, the, fundus, does, not, extend, above, the, linea, terminalis, while, the, vaginal, part, of, the, cervix, does, not, extend, below, the, interspinal, line, the, uterus, is, mobile, and, moves, posteriorly, under, the, pressure, of, a, full, bladder, or, anteriorly, under, the, pressure, of, a, full, rectum, if, both, are, full, it, moves, upwards, increased, intra, abdominal, pressure, pushes, it, downwards, the, mobility, is, conferred, to, it, by, a, musculo, fibrous, apparatus, that, consists, of, suspensory, and, sustentacular, parts, under, normal, circumstances, the, suspensory, part, keeps, the, uterus, in, anteflexion, and, anteversion, in, 90, of, women, and, keeps, it, floating, in, the, pelvis, the, meanings, of, these, terms, are, described, below, the, sustentacular, part, supports, the, pelvic, organs, and, comprises, the, larger, pelvic, diaphragm, in, the, back, and, the, smaller, urogenital, diaphragm, in, the, front, the, pathological, changes, of, the, position, of, the, uterus, are, in, cases, where, the, uterus, is, tipped, also, known, as, retroverted, uterus, the, woman, may, have, symptoms, of, pain, during, sexual, intercourse, pelvic, pain, during, menstruation, minor, incontinence, urinary, tract, infections, fertility, difficulties, and, difficulty, using, tampons, a, pelvic, examination, by, a, doctor, can, determine, if, a, uterus, is, tipped, the, human, uterus, is, supplied, by, arterial, blood, both, from, the, uterine, artery, and, the, ovarian, artery, another, anastomotic, branch, may, also, supply, the, uterus, from, anastomosis, of, these, two, arteries, afferent, nerves, supplying, the, uterus, are, t11, and, t12, sympathetic, supply, is, from, the, hypogastric, plexus, and, the, ovarian, plexus, parasympathetic, supply, is, from, the, s2, s3, and, s4, nerves, bilateral, m, llerian, ducts, form, during, early, human, fetal, life, in, males, anti, m, llerian, hormone, amh, secreted, from, the, testes, leads, to, the, ducts, regression, in, females, these, ducts, give, rise, to, the, fallopian, tubes, and, the, uterus, in, humans, the, lower, segments, of, the, two, ducts, fuse, to, form, a, single, uterus, in, cases, of, uterine, malformations, this, fusion, may, be, disturbed, the, different, uterine, morphologies, among, the, mammals, are, due, to, varying, degrees, of, fusion, of, the, m, llerian, ducts, various, congenital, conditions, of, the, uterus, can, develop, in, utero, though, uncommon, some, of, these, are, didelphic, uterus, bicornate, uterus, and, others, see, also, list, of, related, male, and, female, reproductive, organs, the, primary, reproductive, function, of, the, human, uterus, is, to, prepare, for, the, implantation, of, a, zygote, a, fertilized, ovum, and, maintenance, of, pregnancy, if, implantation, occurs, traveling, along, the, fallopian, tube, on, its, way, to, the, uterine, cavity, the, zygote, divides, mitotically, to, become, a, blastocyst, which, ultimately, attaches, to, the, uterine, wall, and, implants, into, the, endometrium, the, placenta, later, develops, to, nourish, the, embryo, which, grows, through, embryonic, and, fetal, development, until, childbirth, during, this, process, the, uterus, grows, to, accommodate, the, growing, fetus, when, normal, labor, begins, the, uterus, forcefully, contracts, as, the, cervix, dilates, which, results, in, delivery, of, the, infant, in, the, absence, of, pregnancy, menstruation, occurs, the, withdrawal, of, female, sex, hormones, estrogen, and, progesterone, which, occurs, in, the, absence, of, fertilization, triggers, the, shedding, of, the, functional, layer, of, the, endometrium, this, layer, is, broken, down, shed, and, restored, in, anticipation, of, the, next, menstrual, cycle, the, average, bleeding, duration, during, menses, is, 5, 7, days, after, which, the, menstrual, cycle, begins, again, during, pregnancy, the, growth, rate, of, the, fetus, can, be, assessed, by, measuring, the, fundal, height, some, pathological, states, include, uterine, malformations, are, mainly, congenital, malformations, and, include, uterus, didelphys, bicornuate, uterus, and, septate, uterus, congenital, absence, of, the, uterus, is, known, as, m, llerian, agenesis, a, hysterectomy, is, the, surgical, removal, of, the, uterus, which, may, be, carried, out, for, a, number, of, reasons, including, the, ridding, of, tumours, both, benign, and, malignant, a, complete, hysterectomy, involves, the, removal, of, the, body, fundus, and, cervix, of, the, uterus, a, partial, hysterectomy, may, just, involve, the, removal, of, the, uterine, body, while, leaving, the, cervix, intact, it, is, the, most, commonly, performed, gynecological, surgical, procedure, uterus, transplantations, have, been, successfully, carried, out, in, a, number, of, countries, the, transplant, is, intended, to, be, temporary, recipients, will, have, to, undergo, a, hysterectomy, after, one, or, two, successful, pregnancies, this, is, done, to, avoid, the, need, to, take, immunosuppressive, drugs, for, life, with, a, consequent, increased, risk, of, infection, the, procedure, remains, the, last, resort, it, is, as, of, 2023, a, relatively, new, and, somewhat, experimental, procedure, performed, only, by, certain, specialist, surgeons, in, select, centres, it, is, expensive, and, unlikely, to, be, covered, by, insurance, and, it, involves, risk, of, infection, and, organ, rejection, some, ethics, specialists, consider, the, risks, to, a, live, donor, too, great, and, some, find, the, entire, procedure, ethically, questionable, especially, since, the, transplant, is, not, a, life, saving, procedure, most, animals, that, lay, eggs, such, as, birds, and, reptiles, including, most, ovoviviparous, species, have, an, oviduct, instead, of, a, uterus, however, recent, research, into, the, biology, of, the, viviparous, not, merely, ovoviviparous, skink, trachylepis, ivensi, has, revealed, development, of, a, very, close, analogue, to, eutherian, mammalian, placental, development, in, monotremes, mammals, which, lay, eggs, namely, the, platypus, and, the, echidnas, either, the, term, uterus, or, oviduct, is, used, to, describe, the, same, organ, but, the, egg, does, not, develop, a, placenta, within, the, mother, and, thus, does, not, receive, further, nourishment, after, formation, and, fertilization, marsupials, have, two, uteri, each, of, which, connect, to, a, lateral, vagina, and, both, use, a, third, middle, vagina, which, functions, as, the, birth, canal, marsupial, embryos, form, a, choriovitelline, placenta, which, can, be, thought, of, as, something, between, a, monotreme, egg, and, a, true, placenta, in, which, the, egg, s, yolk, sac, supplies, a, large, part, of, the, embryo, s, nutrition, but, also, attaches, to, the, uterine, wall, and, takes, nutrients, from, the, mother, s, bloodstream, however, bandicoots, also, have, a, rudimentary, chorioallantoic, placenta, similar, to, those, of, placental, mammals, the, fetus, usually, develops, fully, in, placental, mammals, and, only, partially, in, marsupials, including, kangaroos, and, opossums, in, marsupials, the, uterus, forms, as, a, duplex, organ, of, two, uteri, in, monotremes, such, as, the, platypus, the, uterus, is, duplex, and, rather, than, nurturing, the, embryo, secretes, the, shell, around, the, egg, it, is, essentially, identical, with, the, shell, gland, of, birds, and, reptiles, with, which, the, uterus, is, homologous, in, mammals, the, four, main, forms, of, the, uterus, are, duplex, bipartite, bicornuate, and, simplex, two, uteri, usually, form, initially, in, a, female, and, usually, male, fetus, and, in, placental, mammals, they, may, partially, or, completely, fuse, into, a, single, uterus, depending, on, the, species, in, many, species, with, two, uteri, only, one, is, functional, humans, and, other, higher, primates, such, as, chimpanzees, usually, have, a, single, completely, fused, uterus, although, in, some, individuals, the, uteri, may, not, have, completely, fused
