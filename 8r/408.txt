carpenter, ants, camponotus, spp, are, large, ants, workers, 7, to, 13, mm, or, 1, 4, to, 1, 2, in, indigenous, to, many, forested, parts, of, the, world, they, build, nests, inside, wood, consisting, of, galleries, chewed, out, with, their, mandibles, or, jaws, preferably, in, dead, damp, wood, however, unlike, termites, they, do, not, consume, wood, but, instead, discard, a, material, that, resembles, sawdust, outside, their, nest, sometimes, carpenter, ants, hollow, out, sections, of, trees, they, also, commonly, infest, wooden, buildings, and, structures, causing, a, widespread, problem, they, are, a, major, cause, of, structural, damage, nevertheless, their, ability, to, excavate, wood, helps, in, forest, decomposition, the, genus, includes, over, 1, 000, species, they, also, farm, aphids, in, their, farming, the, ants, protect, the, aphids, from, predators, usually, other, insects, while, they, excrete, a, sugary, fluid, called, honeydew, which, the, ants, get, by, stroking, the, aphids, with, their, antennae, carpenter, ants, are, generally, large, ants, workers, are, 4, 7, mm, long, in, small, species, and, 7, 13, mm, in, large, species, queens, are, 9, 20, mm, long, and, males, are, 5, 13, mm, long, the, bases, of, the, antennae, are, separated, from, the, clypeal, border, by, a, distance, of, at, least, the, antennal, scape, s, maximum, diameter, the, mesosoma, in, profile, usually, forms, a, continuous, curve, from, the, pronotum, through, to, the, propodeum, carpenter, ant, species, reside, both, outdoors, and, indoors, in, moist, decaying, or, hollow, wood, most, commonly, in, forest, environments, they, cut, galleries, into, the, wood, grain, to, provide, passageways, to, allow, for, movement, between, different, sections, of, the, nest, certain, parts, of, a, house, such, as, around, and, under, windows, roof, eaves, decks, and, porches, are, more, likely, to, be, infested, by, carpenter, ants, because, these, areas, are, most, vulnerable, to, moisture, carpenter, ants, have, been, known, to, construct, extensive, underground, tunneling, systems, these, systems, often, end, at, some, food, source, often, aphid, colonies, where, the, ants, extract, and, feed, on, honeydew, these, tunneling, systems, also, often, exist, in, trees, the, colonies, typically, include, a, central, parent, colony, surrounded, and, supplemented, by, smaller, satellite, colonies, carpenter, ants, are, considered, both, predators, and, scavengers, these, ants, are, foragers, that, typically, eat, parts, of, other, dead, insects, or, substances, derived, from, other, insects, common, foods, for, them, include, insect, parts, honeydew, produced, by, aphids, and, extrafloral, nectar, from, plants, they, are, also, known, for, eating, other, sugary, liquids, such, as, honey, syrup, or, juices, carpenter, ants, can, increase, the, survivability, of, aphids, when, they, tend, them, most, species, of, carpenter, ants, forage, at, night, when, foraging, they, usually, collect, and, consume, dead, insects, some, species, less, commonly, collect, live, insects, when, they, discover, a, dead, insect, workers, surround, it, and, extract, its, body, fluids, to, be, carried, back, to, the, nest, the, remaining, chitin, based, shell, is, left, behind, occasionally, the, ants, bring, the, chitinous, head, of, the, insect, back, to, the, nest, where, they, also, extract, its, inner, tissue, the, ants, can, forage, individually, or, in, small, or, large, groups, though, they, often, opt, to, do, so, individually, different, colonies, in, close, proximity, may, have, overlapping, foraging, regions, although, they, typically, do, not, assist, each, other, in, foraging, their, main, food, sources, normally, include, proteins, and, carbohydrates, instances, of, carpenter, ants, bleeding, chinese, elm, trees, for, the, sap, have, been, observed, in, northern, arizona, these, instances, may, be, rare, as, the, colonies, vastly, exceeded, the, typical, size, of, carpenter, ant, colonies, elsewhere, when, workers, find, food, sources, they, communicate, this, information, to, the, rest, of, the, nest, they, use, biochemical, pheromones, to, mark, the, shortest, path, that, can, be, taken, from, the, nest, to, the, source, when, a, sizable, number, of, workers, follows, this, trail, the, strength, of, the, cue, increases, and, a, foraging, trail, is, established, this, ends, when, the, food, source, is, depleted, the, workers, will, then, feed, the, queen, and, the, larvae, by, consuming, the, food, they, have, found, and, regurgitating, the, food, at, the, nest, foraging, trails, can, be, either, under, or, above, ground, although, carpenter, ants, do, not, tend, to, be, extremely, aggressive, they, have, developed, mechanisms, to, maximize, what, they, take, from, a, food, source, when, that, same, food, source, is, also, visited, by, competing, organisms, this, is, accomplished, in, different, ways, sometimes, they, colonize, an, area, near, a, relatively, static, food, supply, more, often, they, develop, a, systemic, way, to, visit, the, food, source, with, alternating, trips, by, different, individual, ants, or, groups, this, allows, them, to, decrease, the, gains, of, intruders, because, the, intruders, tend, to, visit, in, a, scattered, random, and, unorganized, manner, the, ants, however, visit, the, sources, systematically, so, that, they, reduce, the, average, crop, remaining, they, tend, to, visit, more, resource, dense, food, areas, in, an, attempt, to, minimize, resource, availability, for, others, that, is, the, more, systematic, the, foraging, behavior, of, the, ants, the, more, random, that, of, its, competitors, contrary, to, popular, belief, carpenter, ants, do, not, actually, eat, wood, as, they, are, unable, to, digest, cellulose, they, only, create, tunnels, and, nests, within, it, some, carpenter, ant, species, can, obtain, nitrogen, by, feeding, on, urine, or, urine, stained, sand, this, may, be, beneficial, in, nitrogen, limited, environments, all, ants, in, this, genus, and, some, related, genera, possess, an, obligate, bacterial, endosymbiont, called, blochmannia, this, bacterium, has, a, small, genome, and, retains, genes, to, biosynthesize, essential, amino, acids, and, other, nutrients, this, suggests, the, bacterium, plays, a, role, in, ant, nutrition, many, camponotus, species, are, also, infected, with, wolbachia, another, endosymbiont, that, is, widespread, across, insect, groups, wolbachia, is, associated, with, the, nurse, cells, in, the, queen, s, ovaries, in, the, species, camponotus, textor, which, results, in, the, worker, larva, being, infected, carpenter, ants, work, to, build, the, nests, that, house, eggs, in, environments, with, usually, high, humidity, due, to, their, sensitivity, to, environmental, humidity, these, nests, are, called, primary, nests, satellite, nests, are, constructed, once, the, primary, nest, is, established, and, has, begun, to, mature, residents, of, satellite, nests, include, older, larvae, pupae, and, some, winged, individuals, such, as, male, ants, drones, or, future, queen, ants, only, eggs, the, newly, hatched, larvae, workers, and, the, queen, reside, in, the, primary, nests, as, satellite, nests, do, not, have, environmentally, sensitive, eggs, the, ants, can, construct, them, in, rather, diverse, locations, that, can, actually, be, relatively, dry, some, species, like, camponotus, vagus, build, the, nest, in, a, dry, place, usually, in, wood, when, conditions, are, warm, and, humid, winged, males, and, females, participate, in, a, nuptial, flight, they, emerge, from, their, satellite, nests, and, females, mate, with, a, number, of, males, while, in, flight, the, males, die, after, mating, these, newly, fertilized, queens, discard, their, wings, and, search, for, new, areas, to, establish, primary, nests, the, queens, build, new, nests, and, deposit, around, 20, eggs, nurturing, them, as, they, grow, until, worker, ants, emerge, the, worker, ants, eventually, assist, her, in, caring, for, the, brood, as, she, lays, more, eggs, after, a, few, years, reproductive, winged, ants, are, born, allowing, for, the, making, of, new, colonies, again, satellite, nests, will, be, established, and, the, process, will, repeat, itself, relatedness, is, the, probability, that, a, gene, in, one, individual, is, an, identical, copy, by, descent, of, a, gene, in, another, individual, it, is, essentially, a, measure, of, how, closely, related, two, individuals, are, with, respect, to, a, gene, it, is, quantified, by, the, coefficient, of, relatedness, which, is, a, number, between, zero, and, one, the, larger, the, value, the, more, two, individuals, are, related, carpenter, ants, are, social, hymenopteran, insects, this, means, the, relatedness, between, offspring, and, parents, is, disproportionate, females, are, more, closely, related, to, their, sisters, than, they, are, to, their, offspring, between, full, sisters, the, coefficient, of, relatedness, is, r, 0, 75, due, to, their, haplodiploid, genetic, system, between, parent, and, offspring, the, coefficient, of, relatedness, is, r, 0, 5, because, given, the, event, in, meiosis, a, certain, gene, has, a, 50, chance, of, being, passed, on, to, the, offspring, eusocial, insects, tend, to, present, low, genetic, diversity, within, colonies, which, can, increase, with, the, co, occurrence, of, multiple, queens, polygyny, or, with, multiple, mating, by, a, single, queen, polyandry, distinct, reproductive, strategies, may, generate, similar, patterns, of, genetic, diversity, in, ants, according, to, hamilton, s, rule, for, relatedness, for, relative, specific, interactions, to, occur, such, as, kin, altruism, a, high, level, of, relatedness, is, necessary, between, two, individuals, carpenter, ants, like, many, social, insect, species, have, mechanisms, by, which, individuals, determine, whether, others, are, nestmates, or, not, they, are, useful, because, they, explain, the, presence, or, absence, of, altruistic, behavior, between, individuals, they, also, act, as, evolutionary, strategies, to, help, prevent, incest, and, promote, kin, selection, social, carpenter, ants, recognize, their, kin, in, many, ways, these, methods, of, recognition, are, largely, chemical, in, nature, and, include, environmental, odors, pheromones, transferable, labels, and, labels, from, the, queen, that, are, distributed, to, and, among, nest, members, because, they, have, a, chemical, basis, for, emission, and, recognition, odors, are, useful, because, many, ants, can, detect, such, changes, in, their, environment, through, their, antennae, the, process, of, recognition, for, carpenter, ants, requires, two, events, first, a, cue, must, be, present, on, a, donor, animal, these, cues, are, called, labels, next, the, receiving, animal, must, be, able, to, recognize, and, process, the, cue, in, order, for, an, individual, carpenter, ant, to, be, recognized, as, a, nestmate, it, must, as, an, adult, go, through, specific, interactions, with, older, members, of, the, nest, this, process, is, also, necessary, in, order, for, the, ant, to, recognize, and, distinguish, other, individuals, if, these, interactions, do, not, occur, in, the, beginning, of, adult, life, the, ant, will, be, unable, to, be, distinguished, as, a, nestmate, and, unable, to, distinguish, nestmates, recognition, allows, for, the, presence, of, kin, specific, interactions, such, as, kin, altruism, altruistic, individuals, increase, other, individuals, fitness, at, the, expense, of, their, own, carpenter, ants, perform, altruistic, actions, toward, their, nestmates, so, that, their, shared, genes, are, propagated, more, readily, or, more, often, in, many, social, insect, species, like, these, ants, many, worker, animals, are, sterile, and, do, not, have, the, ability, to, reproduce, as, a, result, they, forgo, reproduction, to, donate, energy, and, help, the, fertile, individuals, reproduce, as, in, most, other, social, insect, species, individual, interaction, is, heavily, influenced, by, the, queen, the, queen, can, influence, individuals, with, odors, called, pheromones, which, can, have, different, effects, some, pheromones, have, been, known, to, calm, workers, while, others, have, been, known, to, excite, them, pheromonal, cues, from, ovipositing, queens, have, a, stronger, effect, on, worker, ants, than, those, of, virgin, queens, in, many, social, insect, species, social, behavior, can, increase, the, disease, resistance, of, animals, this, phenomenon, called, social, immunity, exists, in, carpenter, ants, it, is, mediated, through, the, feeding, of, other, individuals, by, regurgitation, the, regurgitate, can, have, antimicrobial, activity, which, would, be, spread, amongst, members, of, the, colony, some, proteases, with, antimicrobial, activity, have, been, found, to, exist, in, regurgitated, material, communal, sharing, of, immune, response, capability, is, likely, to, play, a, large, role, in, colonial, maintenance, during, highly, pathogenic, periods, polygyny, often, is, associated, with, many, social, insect, species, and, usually, is, characterized, by, limited, mating, flights, small, queen, size, and, other, characteristics, however, carpenter, ants, have, extensive, mating, flights, and, relatively, large, queens, distinguishing, them, from, polygynous, species, carpenter, ants, are, described, as, oligogynous, because, they, have, a, number, of, fertile, queens, which, are, intolerant, of, each, other, and, must, therefore, spread, to, different, areas, of, the, nest, some, aggressive, interactions, have, been, known, to, take, place, between, queens, but, not, necessarily, through, workers, queens, become, aggressive, mainly, to, other, queens, if, they, trespass, on, a, marked, territory, queens, in, a, given, colony, can, work, together, in, brood, care, and, the, workers, tend, to, experience, higher, rates, of, survival, in, colonies, with, multiple, queens, some, researchers, still, subscribe, to, the, notion, that, carpenter, ant, colonies, are, only, monogynous, in, at, least, nine, southeast, asian, species, of, the, cylindricus, complex, including, camponotus, saundersi, workers, feature, greatly, enlarged, mandibular, glands, that, run, the, entire, length, of, the, ant, s, body, they, can, release, their, contents, suicidally, by, performing, autothysis, thereby, rupturing, the, ant, s, body, and, spraying, a, toxic, substance, from, the, head, which, gives, these, species, the, common, name, exploding, ants, the, enlarged, mandibular, gland, which, is, many, times, the, size, of, that, of, a, normal, ant, produces, a, glue, the, glue, bursts, out, and, entangles, and, immobilizes, all, nearby, victims, the, termite, species, globitermes, sulphureus, has, a, similar, defensive, system, carpenter, ants, can, damage, wood, used, in, the, construction, of, buildings, they, can, leave, behind, a, sawdust, like, material, called, frass, that, provides, clues, to, their, nesting, location, carpenter, ant, galleries, are, smooth, and, very, different, from, termite, damaged, areas, which, have, mud, packed, into, the, hollowed, out, areas, carpenter, ants, can, be, identified, by, the, general, presence, of, one, upward, protruding, node, looking, like, a, spike, at, the, waist, attachment, between, the, thorax, and, abdomen, petiole, control, involves, application, of, insecticides, in, various, forms, including, dusts, and, liquids, the, dusts, are, injected, directly, into, galleries, and, voids, where, the, carpenter, ants, are, living, the, liquids, are, applied, in, areas, where, foraging, ants, are, likely, to, pick, the, material, up, and, spread, the, poison, to, the, colony, upon, returning, carpenter, ants, and, their, larvae, are, eaten, in, various, parts, of, the, world, in, australia, the, honeypot, ant, camponotus, inflatus, is, regularly, eaten, raw, by, indigenous, australians, it, is, a, particular, favourite, source, of, sugar, for, australian, aborigines, living, in, arid, regions, partially, digging, up, their, nests, instead, of, digging, them, up, entirely, in, order, to, preserve, this, food, source, the, honey, also, has, antimicrobial, properties, which, the, aboriginal, population, use, to, their, advantage, to, cure, colds, in, north, america, lumbermen, during, the, early, years, in, maine, would, eat, carpenter, ants, to, prevent, scurvy, and, in, john, muir, s, publication, first, summer, in, the, sierra, muir, notes, that, the, northern, paiute, people, of, california, ate, the, tickling, acid, gasters, of, the, large, jet, black, carpenter, ants, in, africa, carpenter, ants, are, among, a, vast, number, of, species, that, are, consumed, by, the, san, people
