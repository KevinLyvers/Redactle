in, multicellular, organisms, stem, cells, are, undifferentiated, or, partially, differentiated, cells, that, can, change, into, various, types, of, cells, and, proliferate, indefinitely, to, produce, more, of, the, same, stem, cell, they, are, the, earliest, type, of, cell, in, a, cell, lineage, they, are, found, in, both, embryonic, and, adult, organisms, but, they, have, slightly, different, properties, in, each, they, are, usually, distinguished, from, progenitor, cells, which, cannot, divide, indefinitely, and, precursor, or, blast, cells, which, are, usually, committed, to, differentiating, into, one, cell, type, in, mammals, roughly, 50, to, 150, cells, make, up, the, inner, cell, mass, during, the, blastocyst, stage, of, embryonic, development, around, days, 5, 14, these, have, stem, cell, capability, in, vivo, they, eventually, differentiate, into, all, of, the, body, s, cell, types, making, them, pluripotent, this, process, starts, with, the, differentiation, into, the, three, germ, layers, the, ectoderm, mesoderm, and, endoderm, at, the, gastrulation, stage, however, when, they, are, isolated, and, cultured, in, vitro, they, can, be, kept, in, the, stem, cell, stage, and, are, known, as, embryonic, stem, cells, escs, adult, stem, cells, are, found, in, a, few, select, locations, in, the, body, known, as, niches, such, as, those, in, the, bone, marrow, or, gonads, they, exist, to, replenish, rapidly, lost, cell, types, and, are, multipotent, or, unipotent, meaning, they, only, differentiate, into, a, few, cell, types, or, one, type, of, cell, in, mammals, they, include, among, others, hematopoietic, stem, cells, which, replenish, blood, and, immune, cells, basal, cells, which, maintain, the, skin, epithelium, and, mesenchymal, stem, cells, which, maintain, bone, cartilage, muscle, and, fat, cells, adult, stem, cells, are, a, small, minority, of, cells, they, are, vastly, outnumbered, by, the, progenitor, cells, and, terminally, differentiated, cells, that, they, differentiate, into, research, into, stem, cells, grew, out, of, findings, by, canadian, biologists, ernest, mcculloch, james, till, and, andrew, j, becker, at, the, university, of, toronto, and, the, ontario, cancer, institute, in, the, 1960s, as, of, 2016, the, only, established, medical, therapy, using, stem, cells, is, hematopoietic, stem, cell, transplantation, first, performed, in, 1958, by, french, oncologist, georges, math, since, 1998, however, it, has, been, possible, to, culture, and, differentiate, human, embryonic, stem, cells, in, stem, cell, lines, the, process, of, isolating, these, cells, has, been, controversial, because, it, typically, results, in, the, destruction, of, the, embryo, sources, for, isolating, escs, have, been, restricted, in, some, european, countries, and, canada, but, others, such, as, the, uk, and, china, have, promoted, the, research, somatic, cell, nuclear, transfer, is, a, cloning, method, that, can, be, used, to, create, a, cloned, embryo, for, the, use, of, its, embryonic, stem, cells, in, stem, cell, therapy, in, 2006, a, japanese, team, led, by, shinya, yamanaka, discovered, a, method, to, convert, mature, body, cells, back, into, stem, cells, these, were, termed, induced, pluripotent, stem, cells, ipscs, the, term, stem, cell, was, coined, by, theodor, boveri, and, valentin, haecker, in, late, 19th, century, pioneering, works, in, theory, of, blood, stem, cell, were, conducted, in, the, beginning, of, 20th, century, by, artur, pappenheim, alexander, maximow, franz, ernst, christian, neumann, the, key, properties, of, a, stem, cell, were, first, defined, by, ernest, mcculloch, and, james, till, at, the, university, of, toronto, and, the, ontario, cancer, institute, in, the, early, 1960s, they, discovered, the, blood, forming, stem, cell, the, hematopoietic, stem, cell, hsc, through, their, pioneering, work, in, mice, mcculloch, and, till, began, a, series, of, experiments, in, which, bone, marrow, cells, were, injected, into, irradiated, mice, they, observed, lumps, in, the, spleens, of, the, mice, that, were, linearly, proportional, to, the, number, of, bone, marrow, cells, injected, they, hypothesized, that, each, lump, colony, was, a, clone, arising, from, a, single, marrow, cell, stem, cell, in, subsequent, work, mcculloch, and, till, joined, by, graduate, student, andrew, john, becker, and, senior, scientist, louis, siminovitch, confirmed, that, each, lump, did, in, fact, arise, from, a, single, cell, their, results, were, published, in, nature, in, 1963, in, that, same, year, siminovitch, was, a, lead, investigator, for, studies, that, found, colony, forming, cells, were, capable, of, self, renewal, which, is, a, key, defining, property, of, stem, cells, that, till, and, mcculloch, had, theorized, the, first, therapy, using, stem, cells, was, a, bone, marrow, transplant, performed, by, french, oncologist, georges, math, in, 1956, on, five, workers, at, the, vin, a, nuclear, institute, in, yugoslavia, who, had, been, affected, by, a, criticality, accident, the, workers, all, survived, in, 1981, embryonic, stem, es, cells, were, first, isolated, and, successfully, cultured, using, mouse, blastocysts, by, british, biologists, martin, evans, and, matthew, kaufman, this, allowed, the, formation, of, murine, genetic, models, a, system, in, which, the, genes, of, mice, are, deleted, or, altered, in, order, to, study, their, function, in, pathology, by, 1998, human, embryonic, stem, cells, were, first, isolated, by, american, biologist, james, thomson, which, made, it, possible, to, have, new, transplantation, methods, or, various, cell, types, for, testing, new, treatments, in, 2006, shinya, yamanaka, s, team, in, kyoto, japan, converted, fibroblasts, into, pluripotent, stem, cells, by, modifying, the, expression, of, only, four, genes, the, feat, represents, the, origin, of, induced, pluripotent, stem, cells, known, as, ips, cells, in, 2011, a, female, maned, wolf, run, over, by, a, truck, underwent, stem, cell, treatment, at, the, zoo, bras, lia, this, being, the, first, recorded, case, of, the, use, of, stem, cells, to, heal, injuries, in, a, wild, animal, the, classical, definition, of, a, stem, cell, requires, that, it, possesses, two, properties, two, mechanisms, ensure, that, a, stem, cell, population, is, maintained, does, not, shrink, in, size, 1, asymmetric, cell, division, a, stem, cell, divides, into, one, mother, cell, which, is, identical, to, the, original, stem, cell, and, another, daughter, cell, which, is, differentiated, when, a, stem, cell, self, renews, it, divides, and, does, not, disrupt, the, undifferentiated, state, this, self, renewal, demands, control, of, cell, cycle, as, well, as, upkeep, of, multipotency, or, pluripotency, which, all, depends, on, the, stem, cell, 2, stochastic, differentiation, when, one, stem, cell, grows, and, divides, into, two, differentiated, daughter, cells, another, stem, cell, undergoes, mitosis, and, produces, two, stem, cells, identical, to, the, original, stem, cells, use, telomerase, a, protein, that, restores, telomeres, to, protect, their, dna, and, extend, their, cell, division, limit, the, hayflick, limit, potency, specifies, the, differentiation, potential, the, potential, to, differentiate, into, different, cell, types, of, the, stem, cell, in, practice, stem, cells, are, identified, by, whether, they, can, regenerate, tissue, for, example, the, defining, test, for, bone, marrow, or, hematopoietic, stem, cells, hscs, is, the, ability, to, transplant, the, cells, and, save, an, individual, without, hscs, this, demonstrates, that, the, cells, can, produce, new, blood, cells, over, a, long, term, it, should, also, be, possible, to, isolate, stem, cells, from, the, transplanted, individual, which, can, themselves, be, transplanted, into, another, individual, without, hscs, demonstrating, that, the, stem, cell, was, able, to, self, renew, properties, of, stem, cells, can, be, illustrated, in, vitro, using, methods, such, as, clonogenic, assays, in, which, single, cells, are, assessed, for, their, ability, to, differentiate, and, self, renew, stem, cells, can, also, be, isolated, by, their, possession, of, a, distinctive, set, of, cell, surface, markers, however, in, vitro, culture, conditions, can, alter, the, behavior, of, cells, making, it, unclear, whether, the, cells, shall, behave, in, a, similar, manner, in, vivo, there, is, considerable, debate, as, to, whether, some, proposed, adult, cell, populations, are, truly, stem, cells, embryonic, stem, cells, escs, are, the, cells, of, the, inner, cell, mass, of, a, blastocyst, formed, prior, to, implantation, in, the, uterus, in, human, embryonic, development, the, blastocyst, stage, is, reached, 4, 5, days, after, fertilization, at, which, time, it, consists, of, 50, 150, cells, escs, are, pluripotent, and, give, rise, during, development, to, all, derivatives, of, the, three, germ, layers, ectoderm, endoderm, and, mesoderm, in, other, words, they, can, develop, into, each, of, the, more, than, 200, cell, types, of, the, adult, body, when, given, sufficient, and, necessary, stimulation, for, a, specific, cell, type, they, do, not, contribute, to, the, extraembryonic, membranes, or, to, the, placenta, during, embryonic, development, the, cells, of, the, inner, cell, mass, continuously, divide, and, become, more, specialized, for, example, a, portion, of, the, ectoderm, in, the, dorsal, part, of, the, embryo, specializes, as, neurectoderm, which, will, become, the, future, central, nervous, system, later, in, development, neurulation, causes, the, neurectoderm, to, form, the, neural, tube, at, the, neural, tube, stage, the, anterior, portion, undergoes, encephalization, to, generate, or, pattern, the, basic, form, of, the, brain, at, this, stage, of, development, the, principal, cell, type, of, the, cns, is, considered, a, neural, stem, cell, the, neural, stem, cells, self, renew, and, at, some, point, transition, into, radial, glial, progenitor, cells, rgps, early, formed, rgps, self, renew, by, symmetrical, division, to, form, a, reservoir, group, of, progenitor, cells, these, cells, transition, to, a, neurogenic, state, and, start, to, divide, asymmetrically, to, produce, a, large, diversity, of, many, different, neuron, types, each, with, unique, gene, expression, morphological, and, functional, characteristics, the, process, of, generating, neurons, from, radial, glial, cells, is, called, neurogenesis, the, radial, glial, cell, has, a, distinctive, bipolar, morphology, with, highly, elongated, processes, spanning, the, thickness, of, the, neural, tube, wall, it, shares, some, glial, characteristics, most, notably, the, expression, of, glial, fibrillary, acidic, protein, gfap, the, radial, glial, cell, is, the, primary, neural, stem, cell, of, the, developing, vertebrate, cns, and, its, cell, body, resides, in, the, ventricular, zone, adjacent, to, the, developing, ventricular, system, neural, stem, cells, are, committed, to, the, neuronal, lineages, neurons, astrocytes, and, oligodendrocytes, and, thus, their, potency, is, restricted, nearly, all, research, to, date, has, made, use, of, mouse, embryonic, stem, cells, mes, or, human, embryonic, stem, cells, hes, derived, from, the, early, inner, cell, mass, both, have, the, essential, stem, cell, characteristics, yet, they, require, very, different, environments, in, order, to, maintain, an, undifferentiated, state, mouse, es, cells, are, grown, on, a, layer, of, gelatin, as, an, extracellular, matrix, for, support, and, require, the, presence, of, leukemia, inhibitory, factor, lif, in, serum, media, a, drug, cocktail, containing, inhibitors, to, gsk3b, and, the, mapk, erk, pathway, called, 2i, has, also, been, shown, to, maintain, pluripotency, in, stem, cell, culture, human, escs, are, grown, on, a, feeder, layer, of, mouse, embryonic, fibroblasts, and, require, the, presence, of, basic, fibroblast, growth, factor, bfgf, or, fgf, 2, without, optimal, culture, conditions, or, genetic, manipulation, embryonic, stem, cells, will, rapidly, differentiate, a, human, embryonic, stem, cell, is, also, defined, by, the, expression, of, several, transcription, factors, and, cell, surface, proteins, the, transcription, factors, oct, 4, nanog, and, sox2, form, the, core, regulatory, network, that, ensures, the, suppression, of, genes, that, lead, to, differentiation, and, the, maintenance, of, pluripotency, the, cell, surface, antigens, most, commonly, used, to, identify, hes, cells, are, the, glycolipids, stage, specific, embryonic, antigen, 3, and, 4, and, the, keratan, sulfate, antigens, tra, 1, 60, and, tra, 1, 81, the, molecular, definition, of, a, stem, cell, includes, many, more, proteins, and, continues, to, be, a, topic, of, research, by, using, human, embryonic, stem, cells, to, produce, specialized, cells, like, nerve, cells, or, heart, cells, in, the, lab, scientists, can, gain, access, to, adult, human, cells, without, taking, tissue, from, patients, they, can, then, study, these, specialized, adult, cells, in, detail, to, try, to, discern, complications, of, diseases, or, to, study, cell, reactions, to, proposed, new, drugs, because, of, their, combined, abilities, of, unlimited, expansion, and, pluripotency, embryonic, stem, cells, remain, a, theoretically, potential, source, for, regenerative, medicine, and, tissue, replacement, after, injury, or, disease, however, there, are, currently, no, approved, treatments, using, es, cells, the, first, human, trial, was, approved, by, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, in, january, 2009, however, the, human, trial, was, not, initiated, until, october, 13, 2010, in, atlanta, for, spinal, cord, injury, research, on, november, 14, 2011, the, company, conducting, the, trial, geron, corporation, announced, that, it, will, discontinue, further, development, of, its, stem, cell, programs, differentiating, es, cells, into, usable, cells, while, avoiding, transplant, rejection, are, just, a, few, of, the, hurdles, that, embryonic, stem, cell, researchers, still, face, embryonic, stem, cells, being, pluripotent, require, specific, signals, for, correct, differentiation, if, injected, directly, into, another, body, es, cells, will, differentiate, into, many, different, types, of, cells, causing, a, teratoma, ethical, considerations, regarding, the, use, of, unborn, human, tissue, are, another, reason, for, the, lack, of, approved, treatments, using, embryonic, stem, cells, many, nations, currently, have, moratoria, or, limitations, on, either, human, es, cell, research, or, the, production, of, new, human, es, cell, lines, mesenchymal, stem, cells, msc, or, mesenchymal, stromal, cells, also, known, as, medicinal, signaling, cells, are, known, to, be, multipotent, which, can, be, found, in, adult, tissues, for, example, in, the, muscle, liver, bone, marrow, and, adipose, tissue, mesenchymal, stem, cells, usually, function, as, structural, support, in, various, organs, as, mentioned, above, and, control, the, movement, of, substances, msc, can, differentiate, into, numerous, cell, categories, as, an, illustration, of, adipocytes, osteocytes, and, chondrocytes, derived, by, the, mesodermal, layer, where, the, mesoderm, layer, provides, an, increase, to, the, body, s, skeletal, elements, such, as, relating, to, the, cartilage, or, bone, the, term, meso, means, middle, infusion, originated, from, the, greek, signifying, that, mesenchymal, cells, are, able, to, range, and, travel, in, early, embryonic, growth, among, the, ectodermal, and, endodermal, layers, this, mechanism, helps, with, space, filling, thus, key, for, repairing, wounds, in, adult, organisms, that, have, to, do, with, mesenchymal, cells, in, the, dermis, skin, bone, or, muscle, mesenchymal, stem, cells, are, known, to, be, essential, for, regenerative, medicine, they, are, broadly, studied, in, clinical, trials, since, they, are, easily, isolated, and, obtain, high, yield, high, plasticity, which, makes, able, to, facilitate, inflammation, and, encourage, cell, growth, cell, differentiation, and, restoring, tissue, derived, from, immunomodulation, and, immunosuppression, msc, comes, from, the, bone, marrow, which, requires, an, aggressive, procedure, when, it, comes, to, isolating, the, quantity, and, quality, of, the, isolated, cell, and, it, varies, by, how, old, the, donor, when, comparing, the, rates, of, msc, in, the, bone, marrow, aspirates, and, bone, marrow, stroma, the, aspirates, tend, to, have, lower, rates, of, msc, than, the, stroma, msc, are, known, to, be, heterogeneous, and, they, express, a, high, level, of, pluripotent, markers, when, compared, to, other, types, of, stem, cells, such, as, embryonic, stem, cells, mscs, injection, leads, to, wound, healing, primarily, through, stimulation, of, angiogenesis, embryonic, stem, cells, escs, have, the, ability, to, divide, indefinitely, while, keeping, their, pluripotency, which, is, made, possible, through, specialized, mechanisms, of, cell, cycle, control, compared, to, proliferating, somatic, cells, escs, have, unique, cell, cycle, characteristics, such, as, rapid, cell, division, caused, by, shortened, g1, phase, absent, g0, phase, and, modifications, in, cell, cycle, checkpoints, which, leaves, the, cells, mostly, in, s, phase, at, any, given, time, escs, rapid, division, is, demonstrated, by, their, short, doubling, time, which, ranges, from, 8, to, 10, hours, whereas, somatic, cells, have, doubling, time, of, approximately, 20, hours, or, longer, as, cells, differentiate, these, properties, change, g1, and, g2, phases, lengthen, leading, to, longer, cell, division, cycles, this, suggests, that, a, specific, cell, cycle, structure, may, contribute, to, the, establishment, of, pluripotency, particularly, because, g1, phase, is, the, phase, in, which, cells, have, increased, sensitivity, to, differentiation, shortened, g1, is, one, of, the, key, characteristics, of, escs, and, plays, an, important, role, in, maintaining, undifferentiated, phenotype, although, the, exact, molecular, mechanism, remains, only, partially, understood, several, studies, have, shown, insight, on, how, escs, progress, through, g1, and, potentially, other, phases, so, rapidly, the, cell, cycle, is, regulated, by, complex, network, of, cyclins, cyclin, dependent, kinases, cdk, cyclin, dependent, kinase, inhibitors, cdkn, pocket, proteins, of, the, retinoblastoma, rb, family, and, other, accessory, factors, foundational, insight, into, the, distinctive, regulation, of, esc, cell, cycle, was, gained, by, studies, on, mouse, escs, mescs, mescs, showed, a, cell, cycle, with, highly, abbreviated, g1, phase, which, enabled, cells, to, rapidly, alternate, between, m, phase, and, s, phase, in, a, somatic, cell, cycle, oscillatory, activity, of, cyclin, cdk, complexes, is, observed, in, sequential, action, which, controls, crucial, regulators, of, the, cell, cycle, to, induce, unidirectional, transitions, between, phases, cyclin, d, and, cdk4, 6, are, active, in, the, g1, phase, while, cyclin, e, and, cdk2, are, active, during, the, late, g1, phase, and, s, phase, and, cyclin, a, and, cdk2, are, active, in, the, s, phase, and, g2, while, cyclin, b, and, cdk1, are, active, in, g2, and, m, phase, however, in, mescs, this, typically, ordered, and, oscillatory, activity, of, cyclin, cdk, complexes, is, absent, rather, the, cyclin, e, cdk2, complex, is, constitutively, active, throughout, the, cycle, keeping, retinoblastoma, protein, prb, hyperphosphorylated, and, thus, inactive, this, allows, for, direct, transition, from, m, phase, to, the, late, g1, phase, leading, to, absence, of, d, type, cyclins, and, therefore, a, shortened, g1, phase, cdk2, activity, is, crucial, for, both, cell, cycle, regulation, and, cell, fate, decisions, in, mescs, downregulation, of, cdk2, activity, prolongs, g1, phase, progression, establishes, a, somatic, cell, like, cell, cycle, and, induces, expression, of, differentiation, markers, in, human, escs, hescs, the, duration, of, g1, is, dramatically, shortened, this, has, been, attributed, to, high, mrna, levels, of, g1, related, cyclin, d2, and, cdk4, genes, and, low, levels, of, cell, cycle, regulatory, proteins, that, inhibit, cell, cycle, progression, at, g1, such, as, p21, cipp1, p27, kip1, and, p57, kip2, furthermore, regulators, of, cdk4, and, cdk6, activity, such, as, members, of, the, ink, family, of, inhibitors, p15, p16, p18, and, p19, are, expressed, at, low, levels, or, not, at, all, thus, similar, to, mescs, hescs, show, high, cdk, activity, with, cdk2, exhibiting, the, highest, kinase, activity, also, similar, to, mescs, hescs, demonstrate, the, importance, of, cdk2, in, g1, phase, regulation, by, showing, that, g1, to, s, transition, is, delayed, when, cdk2, activity, is, inhibited, and, g1, is, arrest, when, cdk2, is, knocked, down, however, unlike, mescs, hescs, have, a, functional, g1, phase, hescs, show, that, the, activities, of, cyclin, e, cdk2, and, cyclin, a, cdk2, complexes, are, cell, cycle, dependent, and, the, rb, checkpoint, in, g1, is, functional, escs, are, also, characterized, by, g1, checkpoint, non, functionality, even, though, the, g1, checkpoint, is, crucial, for, maintaining, genomic, stability, in, response, to, dna, damage, escs, do, not, stop, in, g1, to, repair, dna, damages, but, instead, depend, on, s, and, g2, m, checkpoints, or, undergo, apoptosis, the, absence, of, g1, checkpoint, in, escs, allows, for, the, removal, of, cells, with, damaged, dna, hence, avoiding, potential, mutations, from, inaccurate, dna, repair, consistent, with, this, idea, escs, are, hypersensitive, to, dna, damage, to, minimize, mutations, passed, onto, the, next, generation, the, primitive, stem, cells, located, in, the, organs, of, fetuses, are, referred, to, as, fetal, stem, cells, there, are, two, types, of, fetal, stem, cells, adult, stem, cells, also, called, somatic, from, greek, of, the, body, stem, cells, are, stem, cells, which, maintain, and, repair, the, tissue, in, which, they, are, found, they, can, be, found, in, children, as, well, as, adults, there, are, three, known, accessible, sources, of, autologous, adult, stem, cells, in, humans, stem, cells, can, also, be, taken, from, umbilical, cord, blood, just, after, birth, of, all, stem, cell, types, autologous, harvesting, involves, the, least, risk, by, definition, autologous, cells, are, obtained, from, one, s, own, body, just, as, one, may, bank, their, own, blood, for, elective, surgical, procedures, pluripotent, adult, stem, cells, are, rare, and, generally, small, in, number, but, they, can, be, found, in, umbilical, cord, blood, and, other, tissues, bone, marrow, is, a, rich, source, of, adult, stem, cells, which, have, been, used, in, treating, several, conditions, including, liver, cirrhosis, chronic, limb, ischemia, and, endstage, heart, failure, the, quantity, of, bone, marrow, stem, cells, declines, with, age, and, is, greater, in, males, than, females, during, reproductive, years, much, adult, stem, cell, research, to, date, has, aimed, to, characterize, their, potency, and, self, renewal, capabilities, dna, damage, accumulates, with, age, in, both, stem, cells, and, the, cells, that, comprise, the, stem, cell, environment, this, accumulation, is, considered, to, be, responsible, at, least, in, part, for, increasing, stem, cell, dysfunction, with, aging, see, dna, damage, theory, of, aging, most, adult, stem, cells, are, lineage, restricted, multipotent, and, are, generally, referred, to, by, their, tissue, origin, mesenchymal, stem, cell, adipose, derived, stem, cell, endothelial, stem, cell, dental, pulp, stem, cell, etc, muse, cells, multi, lineage, differentiating, stress, enduring, cells, are, a, recently, discovered, pluripotent, stem, cell, type, found, in, multiple, adult, tissues, including, adipose, dermal, fibroblasts, and, bone, marrow, while, rare, muse, cells, are, identifiable, by, their, expression, of, ssea, 3, a, marker, for, undifferentiated, stem, cells, and, general, mesenchymal, stem, cells, markers, such, as, cd90, cd105, when, subjected, to, single, cell, suspension, culture, the, cells, will, generate, clusters, that, are, similar, to, embryoid, bodies, in, morphology, as, well, as, gene, expression, including, canonical, pluripotency, markers, oct4, sox2, and, nanog, adult, stem, cell, treatments, have, been, successfully, used, for, many, years, to, treat, leukemia, and, related, bone, blood, cancers, through, bone, marrow, transplants, adult, stem, cells, are, also, used, in, veterinary, medicine, to, treat, tendon, and, ligament, injuries, in, horses, the, use, of, adult, stem, cells, in, research, and, therapy, is, not, as, controversial, as, the, use, of, embryonic, stem, cells, because, the, production, of, adult, stem, cells, does, not, require, the, destruction, of, an, embryo, additionally, in, instances, where, adult, stem, cells, are, obtained, from, the, intended, recipient, an, autograft, the, risk, of, rejection, is, essentially, non, existent, consequently, more, us, government, funding, is, being, provided, for, adult, stem, cell, research, with, the, increasing, demand, of, human, adult, stem, cells, for, both, research, and, clinical, purposes, typically, 1, 5, million, cells, per, kg, of, body, weight, are, required, per, treatment, it, becomes, of, utmost, importance, to, bridge, the, gap, between, the, need, to, expand, the, cells, in, vitro, and, the, capability, of, harnessing, the, factors, underlying, replicative, senescence, adult, stem, cells, are, known, to, have, a, limited, lifespan, in, vitro, and, to, enter, replicative, senescence, almost, undetectably, upon, starting, in, vitro, culturing, hematopoietic, stem, cells, hscs, are, vulnerable, to, dna, damage, and, mutations, that, increase, with, age, this, vulnerability, may, explain, the, increased, risk, of, slow, growing, blood, cancers, myeloid, malignancies, in, the, elderly, several, factors, appear, to, influence, hsc, aging, including, responses, to, the, production, of, reactive, oxygen, species, that, may, cause, dna, damage, and, genetic, mutations, as, well, as, altered, epigenetic, profiling, also, called, perinatal, stem, cells, these, multipotent, stem, cells, are, found, in, amniotic, fluid, and, umbilical, cord, blood, these, stem, cells, are, very, active, expand, extensively, without, feeders, and, are, not, tumorigenic, amniotic, stem, cells, are, multipotent, and, can, differentiate, in, cells, of, adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, endothelial, hepatic, and, also, neuronal, lines, amniotic, stem, cells, are, a, topic, of, active, research, use, of, stem, cells, from, amniotic, fluid, overcomes, the, ethical, objections, to, using, human, embryos, as, a, source, of, cells, roman, catholic, teaching, forbids, the, use, of, embryonic, stem, cells, in, experimentation, accordingly, the, vatican, newspaper, osservatore, romano, called, amniotic, stem, cells, the, future, of, medicine, it, is, possible, to, collect, amniotic, stem, cells, for, donors, or, for, autologous, use, the, first, us, amniotic, stem, cells, bank, was, opened, in, 2009, in, medford, ma, by, biocell, center, corporation, and, collaborates, with, various, hospitals, and, universities, all, over, the, world, adult, stem, cells, have, limitations, with, their, potency, unlike, embryonic, stem, cells, escs, they, are, not, able, to, differentiate, into, cells, from, all, three, germ, layers, as, such, they, are, deemed, multipotent, however, reprogramming, allows, for, the, creation, of, pluripotent, cells, induced, pluripotent, stem, cells, ipscs, from, adult, cells, these, are, not, adult, stem, cells, but, somatic, cells, e, g, epithelial, cells, reprogrammed, to, give, rise, to, cells, with, pluripotent, capabilities, using, genetic, reprogramming, with, protein, transcription, factors, pluripotent, stem, cells, with, esc, like, capabilities, have, been, derived, the, first, demonstration, of, induced, pluripotent, stem, cells, was, conducted, by, shinya, yamanaka, and, his, colleagues, at, kyoto, university, they, used, the, transcription, factors, oct3, 4, sox2, c, myc, and, klf4, to, reprogram, mouse, fibroblast, cells, into, pluripotent, cells, subsequent, work, used, these, factors, to, induce, pluripotency, in, human, fibroblast, cells, junying, yu, james, thomson, and, their, colleagues, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, madison, used, a, different, set, of, factors, oct4, sox2, nanog, and, lin28, and, carried, out, their, experiments, using, cells, from, human, foreskin, however, they, were, able, to, replicate, yamanaka, s, finding, that, inducing, pluripotency, in, human, cells, was, possible, induced, pluripotent, stem, cells, differ, from, embryonic, stem, cells, they, share, many, similar, properties, such, as, pluripotency, and, differentiation, potential, the, expression, of, pluripotency, genes, epigenetic, patterns, embryoid, body, and, teratoma, formation, and, viable, chimera, formation, but, there, are, many, differences, within, these, properties, the, chromatin, of, ipscs, appears, to, be, more, closed, or, methylated, than, that, of, escs, similarly, the, gene, expression, pattern, between, escs, and, ipscs, or, even, ipscs, sourced, from, different, origins, there, are, thus, questions, about, the, completeness, of, reprogramming, and, the, somatic, memory, of, induced, pluripotent, stem, cells, despite, this, inducing, somatic, cells, to, be, pluripotent, appears, to, be, viable, as, a, result, of, the, success, of, these, experiments, ian, wilmut, who, helped, create, the, first, cloned, animal, dolly, the, sheep, has, announced, that, he, will, abandon, somatic, cell, nuclear, transfer, as, an, avenue, of, research, ipscs, has, helped, the, field, of, medicine, significantly, by, finding, numerous, ways, to, cure, diseases, since, human, ipscc, has, given, the, advantage, to, make, in, vitro, models, to, study, toxins, and, pathogenesis, furthermore, induced, pluripotent, stem, cells, provide, several, therapeutic, advantages, like, escs, they, are, pluripotent, they, thus, have, great, differentiation, potential, theoretically, they, could, produce, any, cell, within, the, human, body, if, reprogramming, to, pluripotency, was, complete, moreover, unlike, escs, they, potentially, could, allow, doctors, to, create, a, pluripotent, stem, cell, line, for, each, individual, patient, frozen, blood, samples, can, be, used, as, a, valuable, source, of, induced, pluripotent, stem, cells, patient, specific, stem, cells, allow, for, the, screening, for, side, effects, before, drug, treatment, as, well, as, the, reduced, risk, of, transplantation, rejection, despite, their, current, limited, use, therapeutically, ipscs, hold, great, potential, for, future, use, in, medical, treatment, and, research, the, key, factors, controlling, the, cell, cycle, also, regulate, pluripotency, thus, manipulation, of, relevant, genes, can, maintain, pluripotency, and, reprogram, somatic, cells, to, an, induced, pluripotent, state, however, reprogramming, of, somatic, cells, is, often, low, in, efficiency, and, considered, stochastic, with, the, idea, that, a, more, rapid, cell, cycle, is, a, key, component, of, pluripotency, reprogramming, efficiency, can, be, improved, methods, for, improving, pluripotency, through, manipulation, of, cell, cycle, regulators, include, overexpression, of, cyclin, d, cdk4, phosphorylation, of, sox2, at, s39, and, s253, overexpression, of, cyclin, a, and, cyclin, e, knockdown, of, rb, and, knockdown, of, members, of, the, cip, kip, family, or, the, ink, family, furthermore, reprogramming, efficiency, is, correlated, with, the, number, of, cell, divisions, happened, during, the, stochastic, phase, which, is, suggested, by, the, growing, inefficiency, of, reprogramming, of, older, or, slow, diving, cells, lineage, is, an, important, procedure, to, analyze, developing, embryos, since, cell, lineages, shows, the, relationship, between, cells, at, each, division, this, helps, in, analyzing, stem, cell, lineages, along, the, way, which, helps, recognize, stem, cell, effectiveness, lifespan, and, other, factors, with, the, technique, of, cell, lineage, mutant, genes, can, be, analyzed, in, stem, cell, clones, that, can, help, in, genetic, pathways, these, pathways, can, regulate, how, the, stem, cell, perform, to, ensure, self, renewal, stem, cells, undergo, two, types, of, cell, division, see, stem, cell, division, and, differentiation, diagram, symmetric, division, gives, rise, to, two, identical, daughter, cells, both, endowed, with, stem, cell, properties, asymmetric, division, on, the, other, hand, produces, only, one, stem, cell, and, a, progenitor, cell, with, limited, self, renewal, potential, progenitors, can, go, through, several, rounds, of, cell, division, before, terminally, differentiating, into, a, mature, cell, it, is, possible, that, the, molecular, distinction, between, symmetric, and, asymmetric, divisions, lies, in, differential, segregation, of, cell, membrane, proteins, such, as, receptors, between, the, daughter, cells, an, alternative, theory, is, that, stem, cells, remain, undifferentiated, due, to, environmental, cues, in, their, particular, niche, stem, cells, differentiate, when, they, leave, that, niche, or, no, longer, receive, those, signals, studies, in, drosophila, germarium, have, identified, the, signals, decapentaplegic, and, adherens, junctions, that, prevent, germarium, stem, cells, from, differentiating, in, the, united, states, executive, order, 13505, established, that, federal, money, can, be, used, for, research, in, which, approved, human, embryonic, stem, cell, hesc, lines, are, used, but, it, cannot, be, used, to, derive, new, lines, the, national, institutes, of, health, nih, guidelines, on, human, stem, cell, research, effective, july, 7, 2009, implemented, the, executive, order, 13505, by, establishing, criteria, which, hesc, lines, must, meet, to, be, approved, for, funding, the, nih, human, embryonic, stem, cell, registry, can, be, accessed, online, and, has, updated, information, on, cell, lines, eligible, for, nih, funding, there, are, 486, approved, lines, as, of, january, 2022, stem, cell, therapy, is, the, use, of, stem, cells, to, treat, or, prevent, a, disease, or, condition, bone, marrow, transplant, is, a, form, of, stem, cell, therapy, that, has, been, used, for, many, years, because, it, has, proven, to, be, effective, in, clinical, trials, stem, cell, implantation, may, help, in, strengthening, the, left, ventricle, of, the, heart, as, well, as, retaining, the, heart, tissue, to, patients, who, have, suffered, from, heart, attacks, in, the, past, for, over, 90, years, hematopoietic, stem, cell, transplantation, hsct, has, been, used, to, treat, people, with, conditions, such, as, leukaemia, and, lymphoma, this, is, the, only, widely, practiced, form, of, stem, cell, therapy, as, of, 2016, the, only, established, therapy, using, stem, cells, is, hematopoietic, stem, cell, transplantation, this, usually, takes, the, form, of, a, bone, marrow, transplantation, but, the, cells, can, also, be, derived, from, umbilical, cord, blood, research, is, underway, to, develop, various, sources, for, stem, cells, as, well, as, to, apply, stem, cell, treatments, for, neurodegenerative, diseases, and, conditions, such, as, diabetes, and, heart, disease, stem, cell, treatments, may, lower, symptoms, of, the, disease, or, condition, that, is, being, treated, the, lowering, of, symptoms, may, allow, patients, to, reduce, the, drug, intake, of, the, disease, or, condition, stem, cell, treatment, may, also, provide, knowledge, for, society, to, further, stem, cell, understanding, and, future, treatments, the, physicians, creed, would, be, to, do, no, injury, and, stem, cells, make, that, simpler, than, ever, before, surgical, processes, by, their, character, are, harmful, tissue, has, to, be, dropped, as, a, way, to, reach, a, successful, outcome, one, may, prevent, the, dangers, of, surgical, interventions, using, stem, cells, additionally, there, s, a, possibility, of, disease, and, whether, the, procedure, fails, further, surgery, may, be, required, risks, associated, with, anesthesia, can, also, be, eliminated, with, stem, cells, on, top, of, that, stem, cells, have, been, harvested, from, the, patient, s, body, and, redeployed, in, which, they, re, wanted, since, they, come, from, the, patient, s, own, body, this, is, referred, to, as, an, autologous, treatment, autologous, remedies, are, thought, to, be, the, safest, because, there, s, likely, zero, probability, of, donor, substance, rejection, stem, cell, treatments, may, require, immunosuppression, because, of, a, requirement, for, radiation, before, the, transplant, to, remove, the, person, s, previous, cells, or, because, the, patient, s, immune, system, may, target, the, stem, cells, one, approach, to, avoid, the, second, possibility, is, to, use, stem, cells, from, the, same, patient, who, is, being, treated, pluripotency, in, certain, stem, cells, could, also, make, it, difficult, to, obtain, a, specific, cell, type, it, is, also, difficult, to, obtain, the, exact, cell, type, needed, because, not, all, cells, in, a, population, differentiate, uniformly, undifferentiated, cells, can, create, tissues, other, than, desired, types, some, stem, cells, form, tumors, after, transplantation, pluripotency, is, linked, to, tumor, formation, especially, in, embryonic, stem, cells, fetal, proper, stem, cells, induced, pluripotent, stem, cells, fetal, proper, stem, cells, form, tumors, despite, multipotency, ethical, concerns, are, also, raised, about, the, practice, of, using, or, researching, embryonic, stem, cells, harvesting, cells, from, the, blastocyst, results, in, the, death, of, the, blastocyst, the, concern, is, whether, or, not, the, blastocyst, should, be, considered, as, a, human, life, the, debate, on, this, issue, is, mainly, a, philosophical, one, not, a, scientific, one, stem, cell, tourism, is, the, part, of, the, medical, tourism, industry, in, which, patients, travel, to, obtain, stem, cell, procedures, the, united, states, has, had, an, explosion, of, stem, cell, clinics, stem, cell, procedures, are, highly, profitable, for, clinics, the, advertising, sounds, authoritative, but, the, efficacy, and, safety, of, the, procedures, is, unproven, patients, sometimes, experience, complications, such, as, spinal, tumors, and, death, the, high, expense, can, also, lead, to, financial, problems, according, to, researchers, there, is, a, need, to, educate, the, public, patients, and, doctors, about, this, issue, according, to, the, international, society, for, stem, cell, research, the, largest, academic, organization, that, advocates, for, stem, cell, research, stem, cell, therapies, are, under, development, and, cannot, yet, be, said, to, be, proven, doctors, should, inform, patients, that, clinical, trials, continue, to, investigate, whether, these, therapies, are, safe, and, effective, but, that, unethical, clinics, present, them, as, proven, some, of, the, fundamental, patents, covering, human, embryonic, stem, cells, are, owned, by, the, wisconsin, alumni, research, foundation, warf, they, are, patents, 5, 843, 780, 6, 200, 806, and, 7, 029, 913, invented, by, james, a, thomson, warf, does, not, enforce, these, patents, against, academic, scientists, but, does, enforce, them, against, companies, in, 2006, a, request, for, the, us, patent, and, trademark, office, uspto, to, re, examine, the, three, patents, was, filed, by, the, public, patent, foundation, on, behalf, of, its, client, the, non, profit, patent, watchdog, group, consumer, watchdog, formerly, the, foundation, for, taxpayer, and, consumer, rights, in, the, re, examination, process, which, involves, several, rounds, of, discussion, between, the, uspto, and, the, parties, the, uspto, initially, agreed, with, consumer, watchdog, and, rejected, all, the, claims, in, all, three, patents, however, in, response, warf, amended, the, claims, of, all, three, patents, to, make, them, more, narrow, and, in, 2008, the, uspto, found, the, amended, claims, in, all, three, patents, to, be, patentable, the, decision, on, one, of, the, patents, 7, 029, 913, was, appealable, while, the, decisions, on, the, other, two, were, not, consumer, watchdog, appealed, the, granting, of, the, 913, patent, to, the, uspto, s, board, of, patent, appeals, and, interferences, bpai, which, granted, the, appeal, and, in, 2010, the, bpai, decided, that, the, amended, claims, of, the, 913, patent, were, not, patentable, however, warf, was, able, to, re, open, prosecution, of, the, case, and, did, so, amending, the, claims, of, the, 913, patent, again, to, make, them, more, narrow, and, in, january, 2013, the, amended, claims, were, allowed, in, july, 2013, consumer, watchdog, announced, that, it, would, appeal, the, decision, to, allow, the, claims, of, the, 913, patent, to, the, us, court, of, appeals, for, the, federal, circuit, cafc, the, federal, appeals, court, that, hears, patent, cases, at, a, hearing, in, december, 2013, the, cafc, raised, the, question, of, whether, consumer, watchdog, had, legal, standing, to, appeal, the, case, could, not, proceed, until, that, issue, was, resolved, diseases, and, conditions, where, stem, cell, treatment, is, being, investigated, include, research, is, underway, to, develop, various, sources, for, stem, cells, and, to, apply, stem, cell, treatments, for, neurodegenerative, diseases, and, conditions, diabetes, heart, disease, and, other, conditions, research, is, also, underway, in, generating, organoids, using, stem, cells, which, would, allow, for, further, understanding, of, human, development, organogenesis, and, modeling, of, human, diseases, in, more, recent, years, with, the, ability, of, scientists, to, isolate, and, culture, embryonic, stem, cells, and, with, scientists, growing, ability, to, create, stem, cells, using, somatic, cell, nuclear, transfer, and, techniques, to, create, induced, pluripotent, stem, cells, controversy, has, crept, in, both, related, to, abortion, politics, and, to, human, cloning, hepatotoxicity, and, drug, induced, liver, injury, account, for, a, substantial, number, of, failures, of, new, drugs, in, development, and, market, withdrawal, highlighting, the, need, for, screening, assays, such, as, stem, cell, derived, hepatocyte, like, cells, that, are, capable, of, detecting, toxicity, early, in, the, drug, development, process, in, august, 2021, researchers, in, the, princess, margaret, cancer, centre, at, the, university, health, network, published, their, discovery, of, a, dormancy, mechanism, in, key, stem, cells, which, could, help, develop, cancer, treatments, in, the, future
