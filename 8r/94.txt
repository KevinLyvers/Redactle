the, olfactory, system, or, sense, of, smell, is, the, sensory, system, used, for, smelling, olfaction, olfaction, is, one, of, the, special, senses, that, have, directly, associated, specific, organs, most, mammals, and, reptiles, have, a, main, olfactory, system, and, an, accessory, olfactory, system, the, main, olfactory, system, detects, airborne, substances, while, the, accessory, system, senses, fluid, phase, stimuli, the, senses, of, smell, and, taste, gustatory, system, are, often, referred, to, together, as, the, chemosensory, system, because, they, both, give, the, brain, information, about, the, chemical, composition, of, objects, through, a, process, called, transduction, the, peripheral, olfactory, system, consists, mainly, of, the, nostrils, ethmoid, bone, nasal, cavity, and, the, olfactory, epithelium, layers, of, thin, tissue, covered, in, mucus, that, line, the, nasal, cavity, the, primary, components, of, the, layers, of, epithelial, tissue, are, the, mucous, membranes, olfactory, glands, olfactory, neurons, and, nerve, fibers, of, the, olfactory, nerves, odor, molecules, can, enter, the, peripheral, pathway, and, reach, the, nasal, cavity, either, through, the, nostrils, when, inhaling, olfaction, or, through, the, throat, when, the, tongue, pushes, air, to, the, back, of, the, nasal, cavity, while, chewing, or, swallowing, retro, nasal, olfaction, inside, the, nasal, cavity, mucus, lining, the, walls, of, the, cavity, dissolves, odor, molecules, mucus, also, covers, the, olfactory, epithelium, which, contains, mucous, membranes, that, produce, and, store, mucus, and, olfactory, glands, that, secrete, metabolic, enzymes, found, in, the, mucus, olfactory, sensory, neurons, in, the, epithelium, detect, odor, molecules, dissolved, in, the, mucus, and, transmit, information, about, the, odor, to, the, brain, in, a, process, called, sensory, transduction, olfactory, neurons, have, cilia, tiny, hairs, containing, olfactory, receptors, that, bind, to, odor, molecules, causing, an, electrical, response, that, spreads, through, the, sensory, neuron, to, the, olfactory, nerve, fibers, at, the, back, of, the, nasal, cavity, olfactory, nerves, and, fibers, transmit, information, about, odors, from, the, peripheral, olfactory, system, to, the, central, olfactory, system, of, the, brain, which, is, separated, from, the, epithelium, by, the, cribriform, plate, of, the, ethmoid, bone, olfactory, nerve, fibers, which, originate, in, the, epithelium, pass, through, the, cribriform, plate, connecting, the, epithelium, to, the, brain, s, limbic, system, at, the, olfactory, bulbs, the, main, olfactory, bulb, transmits, pulses, to, both, mitral, and, tufted, cells, which, help, determine, odor, concentration, based, on, the, time, certain, neuron, clusters, fire, called, timing, code, these, cells, also, note, differences, between, highly, similar, odors, and, use, that, data, to, aid, in, later, recognition, the, cells, are, different, with, mitral, having, low, firing, rates, and, being, easily, inhibited, by, neighboring, cells, while, tufted, have, high, rates, of, firing, and, are, more, difficult, to, inhibit, how, the, bulbar, neural, circuit, transforms, odor, inputs, to, the, bulb, to, the, bulbar, responses, that, are, sent, to, the, olfactory, cortex, can, be, partly, understood, by, a, mathematical, model, the, uncus, houses, the, olfactory, cortex, which, includes, the, piriform, cortex, posterior, orbitofrontal, cortex, amygdala, olfactory, tubercle, and, parahippocampal, gyrus, the, olfactory, tubercle, connects, to, numerous, areas, of, the, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, brain, stem, retina, auditory, cortex, and, olfactory, system, in, total, it, has, 27, inputs, and, 20, outputs, an, oversimplification, of, its, role, is, to, state, that, it, checks, to, ensure, odor, signals, arose, from, actual, odors, rather, than, villi, irritation, regulates, motor, behavior, primarily, social, and, stereotypical, brought, on, by, odors, integrates, auditory, and, olfactory, sensory, info, to, complete, the, aforementioned, tasks, and, plays, a, role, in, transmitting, positive, signals, to, reward, sensors, and, is, thus, involved, in, addiction, the, amygdala, in, olfaction, processes, pheromone, allomone, and, kairomone, same, species, cross, species, and, cross, species, where, the, emitter, is, harmed, and, the, sensor, is, benefited, respectively, signals, due, to, cerebrum, evolution, this, processing, is, secondary, and, therefore, is, largely, unnoticed, in, human, interactions, allomones, include, flower, scents, natural, herbicides, and, natural, toxic, plant, chemicals, the, info, for, these, processes, comes, from, the, vomeronasal, organ, indirectly, via, the, olfactory, bulb, the, main, olfactory, bulb, s, pulses, in, the, amygdala, are, used, to, pair, odors, to, names, and, recognize, odor, to, odor, differences, stria, terminalis, specifically, bed, nuclei, bnst, act, as, the, information, pathway, between, the, amygdala, and, hypothalamus, as, well, as, the, hypothalamus, and, pituitary, gland, bnst, abnormalities, often, lead, to, sexual, confusion, and, immaturity, bnst, also, connects, to, the, septal, area, rewarding, sexual, behavior, mitral, pulses, to, the, hypothalamus, promote, discourage, feeding, whereas, accessory, olfactory, bulb, pulses, regulate, reproductive, and, odor, related, reflex, processes, the, hippocampus, although, minimally, connected, to, the, main, olfactory, bulb, receives, almost, all, of, its, olfactory, information, via, the, amygdala, either, directly, or, via, the, bnst, the, hippocampus, forms, new, and, reinforces, existing, memories, similarly, the, parahippocampus, encodes, recognizes, and, contextualizes, scenes, the, parahippocampal, gyrus, houses, the, topographical, map, for, olfaction, the, orbitofrontal, cortex, ofc, is, heavily, correlated, with, the, cingulate, gyrus, and, septal, area, to, act, out, positive, negative, reinforcement, the, ofc, is, the, expectation, of, reward, punishment, in, response, to, stimuli, the, ofc, represents, the, emotion, and, reward, in, decision, making, the, anterior, olfactory, nucleus, distributes, reciprocal, signals, between, the, olfactory, bulb, and, piriform, cortex, the, anterior, olfactory, nucleus, is, the, memory, hub, for, smell, when, different, odor, objects, or, components, are, mixed, humans, and, other, mammals, sniffing, the, mixture, presented, by, e, g, a, sniff, bottle, are, often, unable, to, identify, the, components, in, the, mixture, even, though, they, can, recognize, each, individual, component, presented, alone, this, is, largely, because, each, odor, sensory, neuron, can, be, excited, by, multiple, odor, components, it, has, been, proposed, that, in, an, olfactory, environment, typically, composed, of, multiple, odor, components, e, g, odor, of, a, dog, entering, a, kitchen, that, contains, a, background, coffee, odor, feedback, from, the, olfactory, cortex, to, the, olfactory, bulb, suppresses, the, pre, existing, odor, background, e, g, coffee, via, olfactory, adaptation, so, that, the, newly, arrived, foreground, odor, e, g, dog, can, be, singled, out, from, the, mixture, for, recognition, loss, of, smell, is, known, as, anosmia, anosmia, can, occur, on, both, sides, or, a, single, side, olfactory, problems, can, be, divided, into, different, types, based, on, their, malfunction, the, olfactory, dysfunction, can, be, total, anosmia, incomplete, partial, anosmia, hyposmia, or, microsmia, distorted, dysosmia, or, can, be, characterized, by, spontaneous, sensations, like, phantosmia, an, inability, to, recognize, odors, despite, a, normally, functioning, olfactory, system, is, termed, olfactory, agnosia, hyperosmia, is, a, rare, condition, typified, by, an, abnormally, heightened, sense, of, smell, like, vision, and, hearing, the, olfactory, problems, can, be, bilateral, or, unilateral, meaning, if, a, person, has, anosmia, on, the, right, side, of, the, nose, but, not, the, left, it, is, a, unilateral, right, anosmia, on, the, other, hand, if, it, is, on, both, sides, of, the, nose, it, is, called, bilateral, anosmia, or, total, anosmia, destruction, to, olfactory, bulb, tract, and, primary, cortex, brodmann, area, 34, results, in, anosmia, on, the, same, side, as, the, destruction, also, irritative, lesion, of, the, uncus, results, in, olfactory, hallucinations, damage, to, the, olfactory, system, can, occur, by, traumatic, brain, injury, cancer, infection, inhalation, of, toxic, fumes, or, neurodegenerative, diseases, such, as, parkinson, s, disease, and, alzheimer, s, disease, these, conditions, can, cause, anosmia, in, contrast, recent, finding, suggested, the, molecular, aspects, of, olfactory, dysfunction, can, be, recognized, as, a, hallmark, of, amyloidogenesis, related, diseases, and, there, may, even, be, a, causal, link, through, the, disruption, of, multivalent, metal, ion, transport, and, storage, doctors, can, detect, damage, to, the, olfactory, system, by, presenting, the, patient, with, odors, via, a, scratch, and, sniff, card, or, by, having, the, patient, close, their, eyes, and, try, to, identify, commonly, available, odors, like, coffee, or, peppermint, candy, doctors, must, exclude, other, diseases, that, inhibit, or, eliminate, the, sense, of, smell, such, as, chronic, colds, or, sinusitus, before, making, the, diagnosis, that, there, is, permanent, damage, to, the, olfactory, system, prevalence, of, olfactory, dysfunction, in, the, general, us, population, was, assessed, by, questionnaire, and, examination, in, a, national, health, survey, in, 2012, 2014, among, over, a, thousand, persons, aged, 40, years, and, older, 12, 0, reported, a, problem, with, smell, in, the, past, 12, months, and, 12, 4, had, olfactory, dysfunction, on, examination, prevalence, rose, from, 4, 2, at, age, 40, 49, to, 39, 4, at, 80, years, and, older, and, was, higher, in, men, than, women, in, blacks, and, mexican, americans, than, in, whites, and, in, less, than, more, educated, of, concern, for, safety, 20, of, persons, aged, 70, and, older, were, unable, to, identify, smoke, and, 31, natural, gas, the, common, causes, of, olfactory, dysfunction, advanced, age, viral, infections, exposure, to, toxic, chemicals, head, trauma, and, neurodegenerative, diseases, age, is, the, strongest, reason, for, olfactory, decline, in, healthy, adults, having, even, greater, impact, than, does, cigarette, smoking, age, related, changes, in, smell, function, often, go, unnoticed, and, smell, ability, is, rarely, tested, clinically, unlike, hearing, and, vision, 2, of, people, under, 65, years, of, age, have, chronic, smelling, problems, this, increases, greatly, between, people, of, ages, 65, and, 80, with, about, half, experiencing, significant, problems, smelling, then, for, adults, over, 80, the, numbers, rise, to, almost, 75, the, basis, for, age, related, changes, in, smell, function, include, closure, of, the, cribriform, plate, and, cumulative, damage, to, the, olfactory, receptors, from, repeated, viral, and, other, insults, throughout, life, the, most, common, cause, of, permanent, hyposmia, and, anosmia, are, upper, respiratory, infections, such, dysfunctions, show, no, change, over, time, and, can, sometimes, reflect, damage, not, only, to, the, olfactory, epithelium, but, also, to, the, central, olfactory, structures, as, a, result, of, viral, invasions, into, the, brain, among, these, virus, related, disorders, are, the, common, cold, hepatitis, influenza, and, influenza, like, illness, as, well, as, herpes, notably, covid, 19, is, associated, with, olfactory, disturbance, most, viral, infections, are, unrecognizable, because, they, are, so, mild, or, entirely, asymptomatic, chronic, exposure, to, some, airborne, toxins, such, as, herbicides, pesticides, solvents, and, heavy, metals, cadmium, chromium, nickel, and, manganese, can, alter, the, ability, to, smell, these, agents, not, only, damage, the, olfactory, epithelium, but, they, are, likely, to, enter, the, brain, via, the, olfactory, mucosa, trauma, related, olfactory, dysfunction, depends, on, the, severity, of, the, trauma, and, whether, strong, acceleration, deceleration, of, the, head, occurred, occipital, and, side, impact, causes, more, damage, to, the, olfactory, system, than, frontal, impact, however, recent, evidence, from, individuals, with, traumatic, brain, injury, suggests, that, smell, loss, can, occur, with, changes, in, brain, function, outside, of, olfactory, cortex, neurologists, have, observed, that, olfactory, dysfunction, is, a, cardinal, feature, of, several, neurodegenerative, diseases, such, as, alzheimer, s, disease, and, parkinson, s, disease, most, of, these, patients, are, unaware, of, an, olfactory, deficit, until, after, testing, where, 85, to, 90, of, early, stage, patients, showed, decreased, activity, in, central, odor, processing, structures, other, neurodegenerative, diseases, that, affect, olfactory, dysfunction, include, huntington, s, disease, multi, infarct, dementia, amyotrophic, lateral, sclerosis, and, schizophrenia, these, diseases, have, more, moderate, effects, on, the, olfactory, system, than, alzheimer, s, or, parkinson, s, diseases, furthermore, progressive, supranuclear, palsy, and, parkinsonism, are, associated, with, only, minor, olfactory, problems, these, findings, have, led, to, the, suggestion, that, olfactory, testing, may, help, in, the, diagnosis, of, several, different, neurodegenerative, diseases, neurodegenerative, diseases, with, well, established, genetic, determinants, are, also, associated, with, olfactory, dysfunction, such, dysfunction, for, example, is, found, in, patients, with, familial, parkinson, s, disease, and, those, with, down, syndrome, further, studies, have, concluded, that, the, olfactory, loss, may, be, associated, with, intellectual, disability, rather, than, any, alzheimer, s, disease, like, pathology, huntington, s, disease, is, also, associated, with, problems, in, odor, identification, detection, discrimination, and, memory, the, problem, is, prevalent, once, the, phenotypic, elements, of, the, disorder, appear, although, it, is, unknown, how, far, in, advance, the, olfactory, loss, precedes, the, phenotypic, expression,
