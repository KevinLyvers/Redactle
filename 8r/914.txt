see, text, cedrus, with, the, common, english, name, cedar, is, a, genus, of, coniferous, trees, in, the, plant, family, pinaceae, subfamily, abietoideae, they, are, native, to, the, mountains, of, the, western, himalayas, and, the, mediterranean, region, occurring, at, altitudes, of, 1, 500, 3, 200, m, 4, 900, 10, 500, ft, in, the, himalayas, and, 1, 000, 2, 200, m, 3, 300, 7, 200, ft, in, the, mediterranean, cedrus, trees, can, grow, up, to, 30, 40, m, occasionally, 60, m, tall, with, spicy, resinous, scented, wood, thick, ridged, or, square, cracked, bark, and, broad, level, branches, the, shoots, are, dimorphic, and, are, made, up, of, long, shoots, which, form, the, framework, of, the, branches, and, short, shoots, which, carry, most, of, the, leaves, the, leaves, are, evergreen, and, needle, like, 8, 60, mm, long, arranged, in, an, open, spiral, phyllotaxis, on, long, shoots, and, in, dense, spiral, clusters, of, 15, 45, together, on, short, shoots, they, vary, from, bright, grass, green, to, dark, green, to, strongly, glaucous, pale, blue, green, depending, on, the, thickness, of, the, white, wax, layer, which, protects, the, leaves, from, desiccation, the, seed, cones, are, barrel, shaped, 6, 12, cm, long, and, 3, 8, cm, broad, green, maturing, grey, brown, and, as, in, abies, disintegrate, at, maturity, to, release, the, winged, seeds, the, seeds, are, 10, 15, mm, long, with, a, 20, 30, mm, wing, as, in, abies, the, seeds, have, two, or, three, resin, blisters, containing, an, unpleasant, tasting, resin, thought, to, be, a, defence, against, squirrel, predation, cone, maturation, takes, one, year, with, pollination, in, autumn, and, the, seeds, maturing, at, the, same, time, a, year, later, the, pollen, cones, are, slender, ovoid, 3, 8, cm, long, produced, in, late, summer, and, shed, pollen, in, autumn, cedars, share, a, very, similar, cone, structure, with, the, firs, abies, and, were, traditionally, thought, to, be, most, closely, related, to, them, but, molecular, evidence, supports, a, basal, position, in, the, family, c, brevifolia, hooker, elwes, henry, c, deodara, roxburgh, ex, don, don, c, atlantica, endlicher, manetti, ex, carri, re, c, libani, richard, the, five, taxa, of, cedrus, are, assigned, according, to, taxonomic, opinion, to, between, one, and, four, species, the, oldest, known, fossil, of, cedrus, is, cedrus, penzhinaensis, known, from, fossil, wood, found, in, early, cretaceous, albian, sediments, of, kamchatka, russia, cedars, are, adapted, to, mountainous, climates, in, the, mediterranean, they, receive, winter, precipitation, mainly, as, snow, and, summer, drought, while, in, the, western, himalaya, they, receive, primarily, summer, monsoon, rainfall, and, occasional, winter, snowfall, while, no, members, of, cedrus, are, native, to, the, americas, members, of, juniperus, and, cupressaceae, are, native, and, are, called, by, the, common, name, of, cedar, cedars, are, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, species, including, pine, processionary, and, turnip, moth, recorded, on, deodar, cedar, cedars, are, very, popular, ornamental, trees, and, are, often, cultivated, in, temperate, climates, where, winter, temperatures, do, not, fall, below, circa, 25, c, the, turkish, cedar, is, slightly, hardier, to, 30, c, or, just, below, extensive, mortality, of, planted, specimens, can, occur, in, severe, winters, when, temperatures, fall, lower, locales, with, successful, longaeval, cultivation, include, the, mediterranean, region, western, europe, north, to, the, british, isles, southern, australia, and, new, zealand, and, southern, and, western, north, america, cedar, wood, and, cedarwood, oil, are, natural, repellents, to, moths, hence, cedar, is, a, popular, lining, for, cedar, chests, and, closets, in, which, woolens, are, stored, this, specific, use, of, cedar, is, mentioned, in, the, iliad, book, 24, referring, to, the, cedar, roofed, or, lined, storage, chamber, where, priam, went, to, fetch, treasures, to, be, used, as, ransom, the, ancients, made, cedarwood, oil, from, lebanon, cedar, a, true, cedar, of, the, genus, cedrus, however, the, species, used, for, modern, cedar, chests, and, closets, in, north, america, is, juniperus, virginiana, and, cedarwood, oil, is, now, typically, derived, from, various, junipers, and, cypresses, of, the, family, cupressaceae, cedar, is, also, commonly, used, to, make, shoe, trees, because, it, can, absorb, moisture, and, deodorize, many, species, of, cedar, are, suitable, for, training, as, bonsai, they, work, well, for, many, styles, including, formal, and, informal, upright, slanting, and, cascading, some, authorities, consider, cedrus, the, only, true, cedars, and, discourage, use, of, the, name, for, other, genera, without, an, additional, qualifier, such, as, white, cedar, nevertheless, the, name, cedar, has, been, applied, since, about, 1700, to, other, trees, such, as, the, north, american, thuja, plicata, commonly, called, western, red, cedar, and, juniperus, virginiana, commonly, called, red, cedar, or, eastern, red, cedar, in, some, cases, the, botanical, name, alludes, to, this, usage, such, as, the, genus, calocedrus, meaning, beautiful, cedar, also, known, as, incense, cedar, several, species, of, genera, calocedrus, thuja, and, chamaecyparis, in, the, pacific, northwest, having, similarly, aromatic, wood, are, referred, to, as, false, cedars, in, australia, toona, ciliata, has, long, been, known, as, red, cedar, in, furniture, and, as, the, tree, even, though, it, belongs, to, the, meliaceae, or, mahogany, family, both, the, latin, word, cedrus, and, the, generic, name, cedrus, are, derived, from, greek, k, dros, ancient, greek, and, latin, used, the, same, word, k, dros, and, cedrus, respectively, for, different, species, of, plants, now, classified, in, the, genera, cedrus, and, juniperus, juniper, species, of, both, genera, are, native, to, the, area, where, greek, language, and, culture, originated, though, as, the, word, k, dros, does, not, seem, to, be, derived, from, any, of, the, languages, of, the, middle, east, it, has, been, suggested, the, word, may, originally, have, applied, to, greek, species, of, juniper, and, was, later, adopted, for, species, now, classified, in, the, genus, cedrus, because, of, the, similarity, of, their, aromatic, woods, the, name, was, similarly, applied, to, citron, and, the, word, citrus, is, derived, from, the, same, root, however, as, a, loan, word, in, english, cedar, had, become, fixed, to, its, biblical, sense, of, cedrus, by, the, time, of, its, first, recorded, usage, in, ad, 1000
