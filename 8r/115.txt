a, sex, organ, also, known, as, a, reproductive, organ, is, a, part, of, an, organism, that, is, involved, in, sexual, reproduction, sex, organs, constitute, the, primary, sex, characteristics, of, an, organism, sex, organs, are, responsible, for, producing, and, transporting, gametes, as, well, as, facilitating, fertilization, and, supporting, the, development, and, birth, of, offspring, sex, organs, are, found, in, many, species, of, animals, and, plants, with, their, features, varying, depending, on, the, species, sex, organs, are, typically, differentiated, into, male, and, female, types, in, animals, including, humans, the, male, sex, organs, include, the, testicles, epididymides, and, penis, the, female, sex, organs, include, the, clitoris, ovaries, oviducts, and, vagina, the, testicle, in, the, male, and, the, ovary, in, the, female, are, called, the, primary, sex, organs, all, other, sex, related, organs, are, known, as, secondary, sex, organs, the, outer, parts, are, known, as, the, genitals, or, external, genitalia, visible, at, birth, in, both, sexes, while, the, inner, parts, are, referred, to, as, internal, genitalia, which, in, both, sexes, are, always, hidden, in, plants, male, reproductive, structures, include, stamens, in, flowering, plants, which, produce, pollen, female, reproductive, structures, such, as, pistils, in, flowering, plants, produce, ovules, and, receive, pollen, for, fertilization, mosses, ferns, and, some, similar, plants, have, gametangia, for, reproductive, organs, which, are, part, of, the, gametophyte, the, flowers, of, flowering, plants, produce, pollen, and, egg, cells, but, the, sex, organs, themselves, are, inside, the, gametophytes, within, the, pollen, and, the, ovule, coniferous, plants, likewise, produce, their, sexually, reproductive, structures, within, the, gametophytes, contained, within, the, cones, and, pollen, the, cones, and, pollen, are, not, themselves, sexual, organs, together, the, sex, organs, constitute, an, organism, s, reproductive, system, the, primary, sex, organs, are, the, gonads, a, pair, of, internal, sex, organs, which, diverge, into, testicles, following, male, development, or, into, ovaries, following, female, development, as, primary, sex, organs, gonads, generate, reproductive, gametes, containing, inheritable, dna, they, also, produce, most, of, the, primary, hormones, that, affect, sexual, development, and, regulate, other, sexual, organs, and, sexually, differentiated, behaviors, secondary, sex, organs, are, the, rest, of, the, reproductive, system, whether, internal, or, external, the, latin, term, genitalia, sometimes, anglicized, as, genitals, is, used, to, describe, the, externally, visible, sex, organs, in, general, zoology, given, the, great, variety, in, organs, physiologies, and, behaviors, involved, in, copulation, male, genitalia, are, more, strictly, defined, as, all, male, structures, that, are, inserted, in, the, female, or, that, hold, her, near, her, gonopore, during, sperm, transfer, female, genitalia, are, defined, as, those, parts, of, the, female, reproductive, tract, that, make, direct, contact, with, male, genitalia, or, male, products, sperm, spermatophores, during, or, immediately, after, copulation, it, is, hard, to, find, a, common, origin, for, gonads, however, gonads, most, likely, evolved, independently, several, times, at, first, testes, and, ovaries, evolved, due, to, natural, selection, a, consensus, has, emerged, that, sexual, selection, represents, a, primary, factor, for, genital, evolution, male, genitalia, show, traits, of, divergent, evolution, that, are, driven, by, sexual, selection, the, visible, portion, of, eutherian, mammalian, genitals, for, males, consists, of, the, penis, and, scrotum, for, females, it, consists, of, the, vulva, in, placental, mammals, females, have, two, genital, orifices, the, vaginal, and, urethral, openings, while, males, have, only, one, for, the, urethra, male, and, female, genitals, have, many, nerve, endings, resulting, in, pleasurable, and, highly, sensitive, touch, in, most, human, societies, particularly, in, conservative, ones, exposure, of, the, genitals, is, considered, a, public, indecency, in, humans, sex, organs, genitalia, include, external, internal, external, internal, in, typical, prenatal, development, sex, organs, originate, from, a, common, primordium, during, early, gestation, and, differentiate, into, male, or, female, sexes, the, sry, gene, usually, located, on, the, y, chromosome, and, encoding, the, testis, determining, factor, determines, the, direction, of, the, differentiation, the, absence, of, it, allows, the, gonads, to, continue, to, develop, into, ovaries, the, development, of, the, internal, and, external, reproductive, organs, is, determined, by, hormones, produced, by, certain, fetal, gonads, ovaries, or, testicles, and, the, cells, response, to, them, the, initial, appearance, of, the, fetal, genitalia, looks, female, like, a, pair, of, urogenital, folds, with, a, small, protuberance, in, the, middle, and, the, urethra, behind, the, protuberance, if, the, fetus, has, testes, and, the, testes, produce, testosterone, and, if, the, cells, of, the, genitals, respond, to, the, testosterone, the, outer, urogenital, folds, swell, and, fuse, in, the, midline, to, produce, the, scrotum, the, protuberance, grows, larger, and, straighter, to, form, the, penis, the, inner, urogenital, swellings, grow, wrap, around, the, penis, and, fuse, in, the, midline, to, form, the, penile, raphe, each, sex, organ, in, one, sex, has, a, homologous, counterpart, the, process, of, sexual, differentiation, includes, the, development, of, secondary, sexual, characteristics, such, as, patterns, of, pubic, and, facial, hair, and, female, breasts, that, emerge, at, puberty, because, of, the, strong, sexual, selection, affecting, the, structure, and, function, of, genitalia, they, form, an, organ, system, that, evolves, rapidly, a, great, variety, of, genital, form, and, function, may, therefore, be, found, among, animals, in, many, other, vertebrates, a, single, posterior, orifice, the, cloaca, serves, as, the, only, opening, for, the, reproductive, digestive, and, urinary, tracts, if, present, in, both, sexes, all, amphibians, birds, reptiles, some, fish, and, a, few, mammals, monotremes, tenrecs, golden, moles, and, marsupial, moles, have, this, orifice, from, which, they, excrete, both, urine, and, feces, in, addition, to, serving, reproductive, functions, excretory, systems, with, analogous, purpose, in, certain, invertebrates, are, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, cloacae, penile, and, clitoral, structures, are, present, in, some, birds, and, some, reptiles, sexing, fish, is, determined, by, the, shape, of, a, fleshy, tube, behind, the, anus, known, as, genital, papilla, the, organs, concerned, with, insect, mating, and, the, deposition, of, eggs, are, known, collectively, as, the, external, genitalia, although, they, may, be, largely, internal, their, components, are, very, diverse, in, form, the, reproductive, system, of, gastropods, slugs, and, snails, varies, greatly, from, one, group, to, another, planaria, are, flat, worms, widely, used, in, biological, research, there, are, sexual, and, asexual, planaria, sexual, planaria, are, hermaphrodites, possessing, both, testicles, and, ovaries, each, planarian, transports, its, excretion, to, the, other, planarian, giving, and, receiving, sperm, in, most, plant, species, an, individual, has, both, male, and, female, sex, organs, a, hermaphrodite, the, life, cycle, of, land, plants, involves, alternation, of, generations, between, a, sporophyte, and, a, haploid, gametophyte, the, gametophyte, produces, sperm, or, egg, cells, by, mitosis, the, sporophyte, produces, spores, by, meiosis, which, in, turn, develop, into, gametophytes, any, sex, organs, that, are, produced, by, the, plant, will, develop, on, the, gametophyte, the, seed, plants, which, include, conifers, and, flowering, plants, have, small, gametophytes, that, develop, inside, the, pollen, grains, male, and, the, ovule, female, in, flowering, plants, the, flowers, contain, the, sex, organs, sexual, reproduction, in, flowering, plants, involves, the, union, of, the, male, and, female, germ, cells, sperm, and, egg, cells, respectively, pollen, is, produced, in, stamens, and, is, carried, to, the, pistil, or, carpel, which, has, the, ovule, at, its, base, where, fertilization, can, take, place, within, each, pollen, grain, is, a, male, gametophyte, which, consists, of, only, three, cells, in, most, flowering, plants, the, female, gametophyte, within, the, ovule, consists, of, only, seven, cells, thus, there, are, no, sex, organs, as, such, the, sex, organs, in, fungi, are, known, as, gametangia, in, some, fungi, the, sex, organs, are, indistinguishable, from, each, other, but, in, other, cases, male, and, female, sex, organs, are, clearly, different, similar, gametangia, that, are, similar, are, known, as, isogametangia, while, male, and, female, gametangia, are, known, as, heterogametangia, which, occurs, in, the, majority, of, fungi
