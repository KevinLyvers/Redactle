genus, afrocascudo, delturinae, hypoptopomatinae, hypostominae, lithogeneinae, loricariinae, neoplecostominae, otothyrinae, sometimes, included, in, hypoptopomatinae, genus, nannoplecostomus, incertae, sedis, loricariidae, is, the, largest, family, of, catfish, order, siluriformes, with, over, 90, genera, and, just, over, 680, species, loricariids, originate, from, freshwater, habitats, of, costa, rica, panama, and, tropical, and, subtropical, south, america, these, fish, are, noted, for, the, bony, plates, covering, their, bodies, and, their, suckermouths, several, genera, are, sold, as, plecos, notably, the, suckermouth, catfish, hypostomus, plecostomus, and, are, popular, as, aquarium, fish, members, of, the, family, loricariidae, are, commonly, referred, to, as, loricariids, suckermouth, catfishes, armoured, catfish, or, suckermouth, armoured, catfish, the, name, plecostomus, and, its, shortened, forms, pleco, and, plec, are, used, for, many, loricariidae, since, plecostomus, plecostomus, now, called, hypostomus, plecostomus, was, one, of, the, first, loricariid, species, imported, for, the, fish, keeping, hobby, some, loricariids, are, not, normally, considered, plecostomus, such, as, farlowella, catfish, in, their, native, range, these, fish, are, known, as, cascudos, or, acar, s, some, types, of, loricariids, are, often, referred, to, by, their, l, number, this, has, become, common, since, imports, of, loricariid, catfish, from, south, america, often, included, specimens, that, had, not, been, taxonomically, described, currently, l, numbers, are, used, not, only, by, fish, keeping, enthusiasts, but, also, by, biologists, since, they, represent, a, useful, stopgap, until, a, new, species, of, fish, is, given, a, full, taxonomic, name, in, some, cases, two, different, l, numbered, catfish, have, turned, out, to, be, different, populations, of, the, same, species, while, in, other, cases, multiple, but, superficially, similar, species, have, all, been, traded, under, a, single, l, number, because, of, their, highly, specialized, morphology, loricariids, have, been, recognized, as, a, monophyletic, assemblage, in, even, the, earliest, classifications, of, the, siluriformes, meaning, they, consist, of, a, natural, grouping, with, a, common, ancestor, and, all, of, its, descendants, loricariidae, is, one, of, seven, families, in, the, superfamily, loricarioidea, along, with, amphiliidae, trichomycteridae, nematogenyidae, callichthyidae, scoloplacidae, and, astroblepidae, some, of, these, families, also, exhibit, suckermouths, or, armor, although, never, in, the, same, individual, as, in, loricariids, this, is, the, largest, catfish, family, including, about, 684, species, in, around, 92, genera, with, new, species, being, described, each, year, however, this, family, is, in, flux, and, revisions, are, likely, for, example, the, subfamily, ancistrinae, is, accepted, as, late, as, the, 2006, edition, of, nelson, s, fishes, of, the, world, it, later, becomes, grouped, as, a, tribe, because, of, its, recognition, as, a, sister, group, to, the, pterygoplichthyini, under, ambruster, six, subfamilies, are, recognized, delturinae, hypoptopomatinae, hypostominae, lithogeneinae, loricariinae, and, neoplecostominae, monophyly, for, the, family, is, strongly, supported, except, possibly, the, inclusion, of, lithogenes, lithogenes, is, the, only, genus, within, the, subfamily, lithogeneinae, this, genus, and, subfamily, the, most, basal, group, in, loricariidae, is, the, sister, group, to, the, rest, of, the, family, neoplecostominae, are, the, most, basal, group, among, the, loricariids, with, the, exception, of, lithogeneinae, however, the, genera, of, neoplecostominae, do, not, appear, to, form, a, monophyletic, assemblage, the, two, subfamilies, loricariinae, and, hypoptopomatinae, appear, to, be, generally, regarded, as, monophyletic, however, the, monophyly, and, composition, of, the, other, subfamilies, are, currently, being, examined, and, will, likely, be, altered, substantially, in, the, future, the, hypostominae, are, the, largest, subfamily, of, loricariidae, it, is, made, up, of, five, tribes, four, of, the, five, tribes, corymbophanini, hypostomini, pterygoplichthyini, and, rhinelepini, include, about, 24, genera, the, fifth, and, largest, tribe, ancistrini, formerly, recognized, as, its, own, subfamily, includes, 30, genera, loricariid, fossils, are, extremely, rare, the, earliest, known, definitive, taxon, is, taubateia, from, the, late, oligocene, early, miocene, in, brazil, the, putative, cenomanian, member, afrocascudo, initially, described, as, the, earliest, loricariid, catfish, in, 2024, might, represent, a, juvenile, obaichthyid, lepisosteiform, possibly, a, junior, synonym, of, obaichthys, though, this, has, been, disputed, based, on, the, complete, ossification, of, the, bones, indicating, full, maturity, and, the, absence, of, important, holostean, characters, within, the, superfamily, loricarioidea, the, loricariidae, are, the, most, derived, in, this, superfamily, the, trend, is, toward, increasingly, complex, jaw, morphology, which, may, have, allowed, for, the, great, diversification, of, the, loricariidae, which, have, the, most, advanced, jaws, the, family, loricariidae, is, vastly, distributed, over, both, the, east, and, west, sides, of, the, andes, mountains, however, most, species, are, generally, restricted, to, small, geographic, ranges, they, are, primarily, found, in, freshwater, habitats, of, south, america, but, several, loricariines, and, hypostomines, are, native, to, panama, and, two, species, fonchiiichthys, uracanthus, and, hemiancistrus, aspidolepis, are, native, to, costa, rica, species, occur, in, swift, flowing, streams, from, the, lowlands, up, to, 3, 000, m, 9, 800, ft, in, elevation, they, can, also, be, found, in, a, variety, of, other, freshwater, environments, they, can, be, found, in, torrential, mountain, rivers, quiet, brackish, estuaries, black, acidic, waters, and, even, in, subterranean, habitats, this, family, has, extremely, variable, color, patterns, and, body, shapes, loricariids, are, characterized, by, bony, plates, covering, their, bodies, similar, to, the, bony, plates, in, callichthyids, in, latin, lorica, means, corselet, these, fish, exhibit, a, ventral, suckermouth, with, papillae, small, projections, on, the, lips, when, present, the, adipose, fin, usually, has, a, spine, at, the, forward, edge, these, fish, have, when, they, are, present, a, unique, pair, of, maxillary, barbels, these, fish, have, relatively, long, intestines, due, to, their, usually, herbivorous, or, detrivorous, diets, the, body, is, characteristically, flattened, in, this, family, taste, buds, cover, almost, the, entire, surface, of, the, body, and, fin, spines, body, lengths, can, range, from, 2, 22, cm, 0, 87, in, in, nannoplecostomus, eleonorae, to, over, 100, cm, 39, in, in, panaque, acanthicus, and, pterygoplichthys, one, of, the, most, obvious, characteristics, of, the, loricariids, is, the, suckermouth, the, modified, mouth, and, lips, allow, the, fish, to, feed, breathe, and, attach, to, the, substrate, through, suction, the, lips, were, once, believed, to, be, unable, to, function, as, a, sucker, while, respiration, continued, as, the, inflowing, water, would, cause, the, system, to, fail, however, respiration, and, suction, can, function, simultaneously, inflowing, water, passing, under, the, sucker, is, limited, to, a, thin, stream, immediately, behind, each, maxillary, barbel, the, maxillae, in, loricariids, support, only, small, maxillary, barbels, and, are, primarily, used, to, mediate, the, lateral, lip, tissue, in, which, they, are, embedded, preventing, failure, of, suction, during, inspiration, to, achieve, suction, the, fish, presses, its, lips, against, the, substrate, and, expands, its, oral, cavity, causing, negative, pressure, also, unlike, most, other, catfishes, the, premaxillae, are, highly, mobile, and, the, lower, jaws, have, evolved, towards, a, medial, position, with, the, teeth, pointed, rostroventrally, these, are, important, evolutionary, innovations, the, fish, rotates, its, lower, and, upper, jaws, to, scrape, the, substrate, of, the, two, the, lower, jaws, are, more, mobile, loricariid, catfishes, have, evolved, several, modifications, of, their, digestive, tracts, that, function, as, accessory, respiratory, organs, or, hydrostatic, organs, these, complex, structures, would, have, been, independently, evolved, a, number, of, times, within, the, family, this, includes, an, enlarged, stomach, in, the, pterygoplichthyini, hypostomus, and, lithoxus, a, u, shaped, diverticulum, in, rhinelepini, and, a, ring, like, diverticulum, in, otocinclus, it, may, be, noted, that, even, loricariids, with, unmodified, stomachs, have, a, slight, ability, to, breathe, air, considerable, sexual, dimorphism, occurs, in, this, family, most, pronounced, during, the, breeding, season, for, example, in, loricariichthys, the, male, has, a, large, expansion, of, its, lower, lip, which, it, uses, to, hold, a, clutch, of, eggs, ancistrus, males, have, snouts, with, fleshy, tentacles, in, loricariids, odontodes, develop, almost, anywhere, on, the, external, surface, of, the, body, and, first, appear, soon, after, hatching, odontodes, appear, in, a, variety, of, shapes, and, sizes, and, are, often, sexually, dimorphic, being, larger, in, breeding, males, in, most, ancistrini, species, sharp, evertible, cheek, spines, elongated, odontodes, are, often, more, developed, in, males, and, are, used, in, intraspecific, displays, and, combat, unusual, for, bony, fish, many, species, have, a, modified, iris, called, an, omega, iris, the, dorsal, segment, of, the, iris, expands, downward, over, the, pupil, to, form, a, loop, which, can, expand, and, contract, called, an, iris, operculum, when, light, levels, are, high, the, pupil, reduces, in, diameter, and, the, loop, expands, to, cover, the, center, of, the, pupil, giving, rise, to, a, crescent, shaped, light, transmitting, partial, pupil, this, feature, gets, its, name, from, its, similarity, to, an, upside, down, uppercase, greek, letter, omega, the, origins, of, this, structure, are, unknown, but, breaking, up, the, outline, of, the, highly, visible, eye, has, been, suggested, to, aid, camouflage, in, what, are, often, highly, mottled, animals, species, in, the, tribe, rhinelepini, are, an, exceptional, group, among, loricariids, having, a, circular, iris, the, presence, or, absence, of, the, iris, operculum, can, be, used, for, identification, of, species, in, the, subfamily, loricariinae, as, of, 2000, only, 56, loricariid, species, have, been, cytogenically, investigated, the, basal, diploid, number, of, chromosomes, is, 2n, 54, in, this, family, but, with, a, wide, variation, in, the, chromosome, number, in, this, fish, group, ranging, from, 2n, 36, in, the, loricariinae, rineloricaria, latirostris, to, 2n, 96, in, a, species, of, upsilodus, hemipsilichthys, most, members, of, the, ancistrini, and, pterygoplichthyini, have, 52, chromosomes, karyotypic, evolution, by, means, of, centric, fusions, and, centric, fissions, seems, to, be, a, common, feature, among, loricariids, this, is, demonstrated, by, a, higher, number, of, biarmed, chromosomes, in, species, with, lower, diploid, number, and, many, uniarmed, chromosomes, in, species, with, higher, diploid, numbers, studies, conducted, with, representatives, of, some, genera, of, hypostominae, showed, within, this, group, the, diploid, number, ranges, from, 2n, 52, to, 2n, 80, however, the, supposed, wide, karyotypic, diversity, the, family, loricariidae, or, the, subfamily, hypostominae, would, present, is, almost, exclusively, restricted, to, the, genus, hypostomus, and, the, species, from, the, other, genera, had, a, conserved, diploid, number, in, some, species, there, is, a, zz, zw, sex, determination, system, the, suckermouth, exhibited, by, these, catfish, allows, them, to, adhere, to, objects, in, their, habitats, even, in, fast, flowing, waters, the, mouth, and, teeth, also, are, adapted, to, feed, on, a, variety, of, foods, such, as, algae, invertebrates, and, detritus, some, species, notably, the, panaque, are, known, for, xylophagy, or, the, ability, to, digest, wood, most, species, of, loricariids, are, nocturnal, animals, some, species, are, territorial, while, others, such, as, otocinclus, prefer, to, live, in, groups, air, breathing, is, well, known, among, many, loricariids, this, ability, is, dependent, on, the, risk, of, hypoxia, faced, by, a, species, torrent, dwelling, species, tend, to, have, no, ability, to, breathe, air, while, low, land, pool, dwelling, species, such, as, those, of, hypostomus, have, a, great, ability, to, breathe, air, pterygoplichthys, is, known, for, being, kept, out, of, water, and, sold, alive, in, fish, markets, surviving, up, to, 30, hours, out, of, water, loricariids, are, facultative, air, breathers, they, will, only, breathe, air, if, under, stress, and, will, only, use, their, gills, in, situations, when, oxygen, levels, are, high, the, dry, season, is, a, likely, time, for, this, there, would, be, little, food, in, the, stomach, which, would, allow, its, use, for, air, breathing, loricariids, exhibit, a, wide, range, of, reproductive, strategies, including, cavity, spawning, attachment, of, eggs, on, the, underside, of, rocks, and, egg, carrying, parental, care, is, usually, good, and, the, male, guards, the, eggs, and, sometimes, the, larvae, the, eggs, hatch, after, four, to, 20, days, depending, on, the, species, three, species, known, from, subterranean, habitats, are, true, troglobites, with, reduced, pigmentation, appearing, overall, whitish, and, eyes, ancistrus, cryptophthalmus, a, galani, and, a, formoso, similar, adaptions, with, reduced, pigmentation, are, known, from, two, loricariids, found, in, deep, water, in, large, amazonian, rivers, peckoltia, pankimpuju, and, panaque, bathyphilus, loricariids, are, popular, aquarium, fish, where, they, are, often, sold, as, plecs, plecos, or, plecostomus, these, fish, are, often, purchased, because, of, their, algae, eating, habits, though, this, role, may, not, be, carried, out, loricariid, are, either, vegetarian, omnivore, carnivore, or, wood, eaters, a, great, many, species, of, loricariids, are, also, sold, for, their, ornamental, qualities, representing, many, body, shapes, and, colors, most, species, of, loricariids, are, nocturnal, and, will, shy, away, from, bright, light, appreciating, some, sort, of, cover, to, hide, under, throughout, the, day, as, they, often, originate, from, habitats, with, fast, moving, water, filtration, should, be, vigorous, a, number, of, species, of, loricariids, have, been, bred, in, captivity
