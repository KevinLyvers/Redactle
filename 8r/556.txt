see, below, a, caiman, k, e, m, n, also, spelled, cayman, from, ta, no, kaiman, is, an, alligatorid, belonging, to, the, subfamily, caimaninae, one, of, two, primary, lineages, within, the, alligatoridae, family, the, other, being, alligators, caimans, are, native, to, central, and, south, america, and, inhabit, marshes, swamps, lakes, and, mangrove, rivers, they, have, scaly, skin, and, live, a, fairly, nocturnal, existence, they, are, relatively, small, sized, crocodilians, with, an, average, maximum, weight, of, 6, to, 40, kg, 13, to, 88, lb, depending, on, species, with, the, exception, of, the, black, caiman, melanosuchus, niger, which, can, grow, more, than, 4, m, 13, ft, in, length, and, weigh, in, excess, of, 450, kg, 1, 000, ib, the, black, caiman, is, the, largest, caiman, species, in, the, world, and, is, found, in, the, slow, moving, rivers, and, lakes, that, surround, the, amazon, basin, the, smallest, species, is, the, cuvier, s, dwarf, caiman, paleosuchus, palpebrosus, which, grows, to, 1, 2, to, 1, 5, m, 3, 9, to, 4, 9, ft, long, there, are, six, different, species, of, caiman, found, throughout, the, watery, jungle, habitats, of, central, and, southern, america, the, average, length, for, most, of, the, other, caiman, species, is, about, 2, to, 2, 5, m, 6, 6, to, 8, 2, ft, long, caimans, are, distinguished, from, alligators, their, closest, relatives, by, a, few, defining, features, a, lack, of, a, bony, septum, between, the, nostrils, ventral, armor, composed, of, overlapping, bony, scutes, formed, from, two, parts, united, by, a, suture, and, longer, and, sharper, teeth, than, alligators, plus, caimans, tend, to, be, more, agile, and, crocodile, like, in, their, movements, the, calcium, rivets, on, caiman, scales, make, their, hides, stiffer, several, extinct, forms, are, known, including, purussaurus, a, giant, miocene, genus, that, grew, to, 12, m, 39, ft, and, the, equally, large, mourasuchus, which, had, a, wide, duck, like, snout, caimans, are, predators, and, like, alligators, and, crocodiles, their, diet, largely, consists, of, fish, caimans, also, hunt, insects, birds, small, mammals, and, reptiles, due, to, their, large, size, and, ferocious, nature, caimans, have, few, natural, predators, within, their, environments, humans, are, their, main, predators, because, the, animals, have, been, hunted, for, their, meat, and, skin, jaguars, anacondas, and, crocodiles, are, the, only, other, predators, of, caimans, although, they, usually, prey, on, the, smaller, specimens, or, specific, species, of, caiman, such, as, the, spectacled, caiman, and, yacare, caiman, during, summer, or, droughts, caimans, may, dig, a, burrow, and, go, into, a, form, of, summer, hibernation, called, aestivation, female, caimans, build, a, large, nest, in, which, to, lay, their, eggs, the, nests, can, be, more, than, 1, 5, m, 4, 9, ft, wide, female, caimans, lay, between, 10, and, 50, eggs, which, hatch, within, about, six, weeks, once, they, have, hatched, the, mother, caiman, takes, her, young, to, a, shallow, pool, of, water, where, they, can, learn, how, to, hunt, and, swim, the, juveniles, of, spectacled, caiman, have, been, shown, to, stay, together, in, pods, for, up, to, 18, months, caimaninae, is, cladistically, defined, as, caiman, crocodylus, the, spectacled, caiman, and, all, species, closer, to, it, than, to, alligator, mississippiensis, the, american, alligator, this, is, a, stem, based, definition, for, caimaninae, and, means, that, it, includes, more, basal, extinct, caimanine, ancestors, that, are, more, closely, related, to, living, caimans, than, to, alligators, below, is, a, cladogram, showing, the, phylogeny, of, caimaninae, modified, from, hastings, et, al,
