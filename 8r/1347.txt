alzheimer, s, disease, ad, is, a, neurodegenerative, disease, that, usually, starts, slowly, and, progressively, worsens, and, is, the, cause, of, 60, 70, of, cases, of, dementia, the, most, common, early, symptom, is, difficulty, in, remembering, recent, events, as, the, disease, advances, symptoms, can, include, problems, with, language, disorientation, including, easily, getting, lost, mood, swings, loss, of, motivation, self, neglect, and, behavioral, issues, as, a, person, s, condition, declines, they, often, withdraw, from, family, and, society, gradually, bodily, functions, are, lost, ultimately, leading, to, death, although, the, speed, of, progression, can, vary, the, average, life, expectancy, following, diagnosis, is, three, to, twelve, years, the, cause, of, alzheimer, s, disease, is, poorly, understood, there, are, many, environmental, and, genetic, risk, factors, associated, with, its, development, the, strongest, genetic, risk, factor, is, from, an, allele, of, apolipoprotein, e, other, risk, factors, include, a, history, of, head, injury, clinical, depression, and, high, blood, pressure, the, progress, of, the, protein, misfolding, disease, is, largely, associated, with, amyloid, plaques, neurofibrillary, tangles, and, loss, of, neuronal, connections, in, the, brain, a, probable, diagnosis, is, based, on, the, history, of, the, illness, and, cognitive, testing, with, medical, imaging, and, blood, tests, to, rule, out, other, possible, causes, initial, symptoms, are, often, mistaken, for, normal, brain, aging, examination, of, brain, tissue, is, needed, for, a, definite, diagnosis, but, this, can, only, take, place, after, death, no, treatments, can, stop, or, reverse, its, progression, though, some, may, temporarily, improve, symptoms, or, slow, the, progression, of, the, disease, a, healthy, diet, physical, activity, and, social, engagement, are, generally, beneficial, in, aging, and, may, help, in, reducing, the, risk, of, cognitive, decline, and, alzheimer, s, affected, people, become, increasingly, reliant, on, others, for, assistance, often, placing, a, burden, on, caregivers, the, pressures, can, include, social, psychological, physical, and, economic, elements, exercise, programs, may, be, beneficial, with, respect, to, activities, of, daily, living, and, can, potentially, improve, outcomes, behavioral, problems, or, psychosis, due, to, dementia, are, sometimes, treated, with, antipsychotics, but, this, has, an, increased, risk, of, early, death, as, of, 2020, there, were, approximately, 50, million, people, worldwide, with, alzheimer, s, disease, it, most, often, begins, in, people, over, 65, years, of, age, although, up, to, 10, of, cases, are, early, onset, impacting, those, in, their, 30s, to, mid, 60s, it, affects, about, 6, of, people, 65, years, and, older, and, women, more, often, than, men, the, disease, is, named, after, german, psychiatrist, and, pathologist, alois, alzheimer, who, first, described, it, in, 1906, alzheimer, s, financial, burden, on, society, is, large, with, an, estimated, global, annual, cost, of, us, 1, trillion, it, is, ranked, as, the, seventh, leading, cause, of, death, worldwide, the, course, of, alzheimer, s, is, generally, described, in, three, stages, with, a, progressive, pattern, of, cognitive, and, functional, impairment, the, three, stages, are, described, as, early, or, mild, middle, or, moderate, and, late, or, severe, the, disease, is, known, to, target, the, hippocampus, which, is, associated, with, memory, and, this, is, responsible, for, the, first, symptoms, of, memory, impairment, as, the, disease, progresses, so, does, the, degree, of, memory, impairment, the, first, symptoms, are, often, mistakenly, attributed, to, aging, or, stress, detailed, neuropsychological, testing, can, reveal, mild, cognitive, difficulties, up, to, eight, years, before, a, person, fulfills, the, clinical, criteria, for, diagnosis, of, alzheimer, s, disease, these, early, symptoms, can, affect, the, most, complex, activities, of, daily, living, the, most, noticeable, deficit, is, short, term, memory, loss, which, shows, up, as, difficulty, in, remembering, recently, learned, facts, and, inability, to, acquire, new, information, subtle, problems, with, the, executive, functions, of, attentiveness, planning, flexibility, and, abstract, thinking, or, impairments, in, semantic, memory, memory, of, meanings, and, concept, relationships, can, also, be, symptomatic, of, the, early, stages, of, alzheimer, s, disease, apathy, and, depression, can, be, seen, at, this, stage, with, apathy, remaining, as, the, most, persistent, symptom, throughout, the, course, of, the, disease, mild, cognitive, impairment, mci, is, often, found, to, be, a, transitional, stage, between, normal, aging, and, dementia, mci, can, present, with, a, variety, of, symptoms, and, when, memory, loss, is, the, predominant, symptom, it, is, termed, amnestic, mci, and, is, frequently, seen, as, a, prodromal, stage, of, alzheimer, s, disease, amnesic, mci, has, a, greater, than, 90, likelihood, of, being, associated, with, alzheimer, s, in, people, with, alzheimer, s, disease, the, increasing, impairment, of, learning, and, memory, eventually, leads, to, a, definitive, diagnosis, in, a, small, percentage, difficulties, with, language, executive, functions, perception, agnosia, or, execution, of, movements, apraxia, are, more, prominent, than, memory, problems, alzheimer, s, disease, does, not, affect, all, memory, capacities, equally, older, memories, of, the, person, s, life, episodic, memory, facts, learned, semantic, memory, and, implicit, memory, the, memory, of, the, body, on, how, to, do, things, such, as, using, a, fork, to, eat, or, how, to, drink, from, a, glass, are, affected, to, a, lesser, degree, than, new, facts, or, memories, language, problems, are, mainly, characterised, by, a, shrinking, vocabulary, and, decreased, word, fluency, leading, to, a, general, impoverishment, of, oral, and, written, language, in, this, stage, the, person, with, alzheimer, s, is, usually, capable, of, communicating, basic, ideas, adequately, while, performing, fine, motor, tasks, such, as, writing, drawing, or, dressing, certain, movement, coordination, and, planning, difficulties, apraxia, may, be, present, but, they, are, commonly, unnoticed, as, the, disease, progresses, people, with, alzheimer, s, disease, can, often, continue, to, perform, many, tasks, independently, but, may, need, assistance, or, supervision, with, the, most, cognitively, demanding, activities, progressive, deterioration, eventually, hinders, independence, with, subjects, being, unable, to, perform, most, common, activities, of, daily, living, speech, difficulties, become, evident, due, to, an, inability, to, recall, vocabulary, which, leads, to, frequent, incorrect, word, substitutions, paraphasias, reading, and, writing, skills, are, also, progressively, lost, complex, motor, sequences, become, less, coordinated, as, time, passes, and, alzheimer, s, disease, progresses, so, the, risk, of, falling, increases, during, this, phase, memory, problems, worsen, and, the, person, may, fail, to, recognise, close, relatives, long, term, memory, which, was, previously, intact, becomes, impaired, behavioral, and, neuropsychiatric, changes, become, more, prevalent, common, manifestations, are, wandering, irritability, and, emotional, lability, leading, to, crying, outbursts, of, unpremeditated, aggression, or, resistance, to, caregiving, sundowning, can, also, appear, approximately, 30, of, people, with, alzheimer, s, disease, develop, illusionary, misidentifications, and, other, delusional, symptoms, subjects, also, lose, insight, of, their, disease, process, and, limitations, anosognosia, urinary, incontinence, can, develop, these, symptoms, create, stress, for, relatives, and, caregivers, which, can, be, reduced, by, moving, the, person, from, home, care, to, other, long, term, care, facilities, during, the, final, stage, known, as, the, late, stage, or, severe, stage, there, is, complete, dependence, on, caregivers, language, is, reduced, to, simple, phrases, or, even, single, words, eventually, leading, to, complete, loss, of, speech, despite, the, loss, of, verbal, language, abilities, people, can, often, understand, and, return, emotional, signals, although, aggressiveness, can, still, be, present, extreme, apathy, and, exhaustion, are, much, more, common, symptoms, people, with, alzheimer, s, disease, will, ultimately, not, be, able, to, perform, even, the, simplest, tasks, independently, muscle, mass, and, mobility, deteriorates, to, the, point, where, they, are, bedridden, and, unable, to, feed, themselves, the, cause, of, death, is, usually, an, external, factor, such, as, infection, of, pressure, ulcers, or, pneumonia, not, the, disease, itself, in, some, cases, there, is, a, paradoxical, lucidity, immediately, before, death, where, there, is, an, unexpected, recovery, of, mental, clarity, alzheimer, s, disease, is, believed, to, occur, when, abnormal, amounts, of, amyloid, beta, a, accumulating, extracellularly, as, amyloid, plaques, and, tau, proteins, or, intracellularly, as, neurofibrillary, tangles, form, in, the, brain, affecting, neuronal, functioning, and, connectivity, resulting, in, a, progressive, loss, of, brain, function, this, altered, protein, clearance, ability, is, age, related, regulated, by, brain, cholesterol, and, associated, with, other, neurodegenerative, diseases, the, cause, for, most, alzheimer, s, cases, is, still, mostly, unknown, except, for, 1, 2, of, cases, where, deterministic, genetic, differences, have, been, identified, several, competing, hypotheses, attempt, to, explain, the, underlying, cause, the, most, predominant, hypothesis, is, the, amyloid, beta, a, hypothesis, the, oldest, hypothesis, on, which, most, drug, therapies, are, based, is, the, cholinergic, hypothesis, which, proposes, that, alzheimer, s, disease, is, caused, by, reduced, synthesis, of, the, neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, the, loss, of, cholinergic, neurons, noted, in, the, limbic, system, and, cerebral, cortex, is, a, key, feature, in, the, progression, of, alzheimer, s, the, 1991, amyloid, hypothesis, postulated, that, extracellular, amyloid, beta, a, deposits, are, the, fundamental, cause, of, the, disease, support, for, this, postulate, comes, from, the, location, of, the, gene, for, the, amyloid, precursor, protein, app, on, chromosome, 21, together, with, the, fact, that, people, with, trisomy, 21, down, syndrome, who, have, an, extra, gene, copy, almost, universally, exhibit, at, least, the, earliest, symptoms, of, alzheimer, s, disease, by, 40, years, of, age, a, specific, isoform, of, apolipoprotein, apoe4, is, a, major, genetic, risk, factor, for, alzheimer, s, disease, while, apolipoproteins, enhance, the, breakdown, of, beta, amyloid, some, isoforms, are, not, very, effective, at, this, task, such, as, apoe4, leading, to, excess, amyloid, buildup, in, the, brain, late, onset, alzheimer, s, is, about, 70, heritable, genetic, models, in, 2020, predict, alzheimer, s, disease, with, 90, accuracy, most, cases, of, alzheimer, s, are, not, familial, and, so, they, are, termed, sporadic, alzheimer, s, disease, of, the, cases, of, sporadic, alzheimer, s, disease, most, are, classified, as, late, onset, where, they, are, developed, after, the, age, of, 65, years, the, strongest, genetic, risk, factor, for, sporadic, alzheimer, s, disease, is, apoe, 4, apoe, 4, is, one, of, four, alleles, of, apolipoprotein, e, apoe, apoe, plays, a, major, role, in, lipid, binding, proteins, in, lipoprotein, particles, and, the, 4, allele, disrupts, this, function, between, 40, and, 80, of, people, with, alzheimer, s, disease, possess, at, least, one, apoe, 4, allele, the, apoe, 4, allele, increases, the, risk, of, the, disease, by, three, times, in, heterozygotes, and, by, 15, times, in, homozygotes, like, many, human, diseases, environmental, effects, and, genetic, modifiers, result, in, incomplete, penetrance, for, example, nigerian, yoruba, people, do, not, show, the, relationship, between, dose, of, apoe, 4, and, incidence, or, age, of, onset, for, alzheimer, s, disease, seen, in, other, human, populations, only, 1, 2, of, alzheimer, s, cases, are, inherited, due, to, autosomal, dominant, effects, as, alzheimer, s, is, highly, polygenic, when, the, disease, is, caused, by, autosomal, dominant, variants, it, is, known, as, early, onset, familial, alzheimer, s, disease, which, is, rarer, and, has, a, faster, rate, of, progression, less, than, 5, of, sporadic, alzheimer, s, disease, have, an, earlier, onset, and, early, onset, alzheimer, s, is, about, 90, heritable, familial, alzheimer, s, disease, usually, implies, two, or, more, persons, affected, in, one, or, more, generations, early, onset, familial, alzheimer, s, disease, can, be, attributed, to, mutations, in, one, of, three, genes, those, encoding, amyloid, beta, precursor, protein, app, and, presenilins, psen1, and, psen2, most, mutations, in, the, app, and, presenilin, genes, increase, the, production, of, a, small, protein, called, amyloid, beta, a, 42, which, is, the, main, component, of, amyloid, plaques, some, of, the, mutations, merely, alter, the, ratio, between, a, 42, and, the, other, major, forms, particularly, a, 40, without, increasing, a, 42, levels, in, the, brain, two, other, genes, associated, with, autosomal, dominant, alzheimer, s, disease, are, abca7, and, sorl1, alleles, in, the, trem2, gene, have, been, associated, with, a, three, to, five, times, higher, risk, of, developing, alzheimer, s, disease, a, japanese, pedigree, of, familial, alzheimer, s, disease, was, found, to, be, associated, with, a, deletion, mutation, of, codon, 693, of, app, this, mutation, and, its, association, with, alzheimer, s, disease, was, first, reported, in, 2008, and, is, known, as, the, osaka, mutation, only, homozygotes, with, this, mutation, have, an, increased, risk, of, developing, alzheimer, s, disease, this, mutation, accelerates, a, oligomerization, but, the, proteins, do, not, form, the, amyloid, fibrils, that, aggregate, into, amyloid, plaques, suggesting, that, it, is, the, a, oligomerization, rather, than, the, fibrils, that, may, be, the, cause, of, this, disease, mice, expressing, this, mutation, have, all, the, usual, pathologies, of, alzheimer, s, disease, the, tau, hypothesis, proposes, that, tau, protein, abnormalities, initiate, the, disease, cascade, in, this, model, hyperphosphorylated, tau, begins, to, pair, with, other, threads, of, tau, as, paired, helical, filaments, eventually, they, form, neurofibrillary, tangles, inside, nerve, cell, bodies, when, this, occurs, the, microtubules, disintegrate, destroying, the, structure, of, the, cell, s, cytoskeleton, which, collapses, the, neuron, s, transport, system, a, number, of, studies, connect, the, misfolded, amyloid, beta, and, tau, proteins, associated, with, the, pathology, of, alzheimer, s, disease, as, bringing, about, oxidative, stress, that, leads, to, neuroinflammation, this, chronic, inflammation, is, also, a, feature, of, other, neurodegenerative, diseases, including, parkinson, s, disease, and, als, spirochete, infections, have, also, been, linked, to, dementia, dna, damages, accumulate, in, alzheimer, s, diseased, brains, reactive, oxygen, species, may, be, the, major, source, of, this, dna, damage, sleep, disturbances, are, seen, as, a, possible, risk, factor, for, inflammation, in, alzheimer, s, disease, sleep, disruption, was, previously, only, seen, as, a, consequence, of, alzheimer, s, disease, but, as, of, 2020, accumulating, evidence, suggests, that, this, relationship, may, be, bidirectional, the, cellular, homeostasis, of, biometals, such, as, ionic, copper, iron, and, zinc, is, disrupted, in, alzheimer, s, disease, though, it, remains, unclear, whether, this, is, produced, by, or, causes, the, changes, in, proteins, smoking, is, a, significant, alzheimer, s, disease, risk, factor, systemic, markers, of, the, innate, immune, system, are, risk, factors, for, late, onset, alzheimer, s, disease, exposure, to, air, pollution, may, be, a, contributing, factor, to, the, development, of, alzheimer, s, disease, retrogenesis, is, a, medical, hypothesis, that, just, as, the, fetus, goes, through, a, process, of, neurodevelopment, beginning, with, neurulation, and, ending, with, myelination, the, brains, of, people, with, alzheimer, s, disease, go, through, a, reverse, neurodegeneration, process, starting, with, demyelination, and, death, of, axons, white, matter, and, ending, with, the, death, of, grey, matter, likewise, the, hypothesis, is, that, as, infants, go, through, states, of, cognitive, development, people, with, alzheimer, s, disease, go, through, the, reverse, process, of, progressive, cognitive, impairment, according, to, one, theory, dysfunction, of, oligodendrocytes, and, their, associated, myelin, during, aging, contributes, to, axon, damage, which, in, turn, generates, in, amyloid, production, and, tau, hyperphosphorylation, an, in, vivo, study, employing, genetic, mouse, models, to, simulate, myelin, dysfunction, and, amyloidosis, further, reveal, that, age, related, myelin, degradation, increases, sites, of, a, production, and, distracts, microglia, from, a, plaques, with, both, mechanisms, dually, exacerbating, amyloidosis, additionally, comorbidities, between, the, demyelinating, disease, multiple, sclerosis, and, alzheimer, s, disease, have, been, reported, the, association, with, celiac, disease, is, unclear, with, a, 2019, study, finding, no, increase, in, dementia, overall, in, those, with, celiac, disease, while, a, 2018, review, found, an, association, with, several, types, of, dementia, including, alzheimer, s, disease, studies, have, shown, a, potential, link, between, infection, with, certain, viruses, and, developing, alzheimer, s, disease, later, in, life, notably, a, large, scale, study, conducted, on, 6, 245, 282, patients, has, shown, an, increased, risk, of, developing, alzheimer, s, disease, following, covid, 19, infection, in, cognitively, normal, individuals, over, 65, alzheimer, s, disease, is, characterised, by, loss, of, neurons, and, synapses, in, the, cerebral, cortex, and, certain, subcortical, regions, this, loss, results, in, gross, atrophy, of, the, affected, regions, including, degeneration, in, the, temporal, lobe, and, parietal, lobe, and, parts, of, the, frontal, cortex, and, cingulate, gyrus, degeneration, is, also, present, in, brainstem, nuclei, particularly, the, locus, coeruleus, in, the, pons, studies, using, mri, and, pet, have, documented, reductions, in, the, size, of, specific, brain, regions, in, people, with, alzheimer, s, disease, as, they, progressed, from, mild, cognitive, impairment, to, alzheimer, s, disease, and, in, comparison, with, similar, images, from, healthy, older, adults, both, a, plaques, and, neurofibrillary, tangles, are, clearly, visible, by, microscopy, in, brains, of, those, with, alzheimer, s, disease, especially, in, the, hippocampus, however, alzheimer, s, disease, may, occur, without, neurofibrillary, tangles, in, the, neocortex, plaques, are, dense, mostly, insoluble, deposits, of, beta, amyloid, peptide, and, cellular, material, outside, and, around, neurons, neurofibrillary, tangles, are, aggregates, of, the, microtubule, associated, protein, tau, which, has, become, hyperphosphorylated, and, accumulate, inside, the, cells, themselves, although, many, older, individuals, develop, some, plaques, and, tangles, as, a, consequence, of, aging, the, brains, of, people, with, alzheimer, s, disease, have, a, greater, number, of, them, in, specific, brain, regions, such, as, the, temporal, lobe, lewy, bodies, are, not, rare, in, the, brains, of, people, with, alzheimer, s, disease, alzheimer, s, disease, has, been, identified, as, a, protein, misfolding, disease, a, proteopathy, caused, by, the, accumulation, of, abnormally, folded, amyloid, beta, protein, into, amyloid, plaques, and, tau, protein, into, neurofibrillary, tangles, in, the, brain, plaques, are, made, up, of, small, peptides, 39, 43, amino, acids, in, length, called, amyloid, beta, amyloid, beta, is, a, fragment, from, the, larger, amyloid, beta, precursor, protein, app, a, transmembrane, protein, that, penetrates, the, cell, s, membrane, app, is, critical, to, neuron, growth, survival, and, post, injury, repair, in, alzheimer, s, disease, gamma, secretase, and, beta, secretase, act, together, in, a, proteolytic, process, which, causes, app, to, be, divided, into, smaller, fragments, although, commonly, researched, as, neuronal, proteins, app, and, its, processing, enzymes, are, abundantly, expressed, by, other, brain, cells, one, of, these, fragments, gives, rise, to, fibrils, of, amyloid, beta, which, then, form, clumps, that, deposit, outside, neurons, in, dense, formations, known, as, amyloid, plaques, excitatory, neurons, especially, are, known, to, be, the, major, producers, of, amyloid, beta, that, contribute, to, major, extracellular, plaque, deposition, alzheimer, s, disease, is, also, considered, a, tauopathy, due, to, abnormal, aggregation, of, the, tau, protein, every, neuron, has, a, cytoskeleton, an, internal, support, structure, partly, made, up, of, structures, called, microtubules, these, microtubules, act, like, tracks, guiding, nutrients, and, molecules, from, the, body, of, the, cell, to, the, ends, of, the, axon, and, back, a, protein, called, tau, stabilises, the, microtubules, when, phosphorylated, and, is, therefore, called, a, microtubule, associated, protein, in, alzheimer, s, disease, tau, undergoes, chemical, changes, becoming, hyperphosphorylated, it, then, begins, to, pair, with, other, threads, creating, neurofibrillary, tangles, and, disintegrating, the, neuron, s, transport, system, pathogenic, tau, can, also, cause, neuronal, death, through, transposable, element, dysregulation, necroptosis, has, also, been, reported, as, a, mechanism, of, cell, death, in, brain, cells, affected, with, tau, tangles, exactly, how, disturbances, of, production, and, aggregation, of, the, beta, amyloid, peptide, give, rise, to, the, pathology, of, alzheimer, s, disease, is, not, known, the, amyloid, hypothesis, traditionally, points, to, the, accumulation, of, beta, amyloid, peptides, as, the, central, event, triggering, neuron, degeneration, accumulation, of, aggregated, amyloid, fibrils, which, are, believed, to, be, the, toxic, form, of, the, protein, responsible, for, disrupting, the, cell, s, calcium, ion, homeostasis, induces, programmed, cell, death, apoptosis, it, is, also, known, that, a, selectively, builds, up, in, the, mitochondria, in, the, cells, of, alzheimer, s, affected, brains, and, it, also, inhibits, certain, enzyme, functions, and, the, utilisation, of, glucose, by, neurons, iron, dyshomeostasis, is, linked, to, disease, progression, an, iron, dependent, form, of, regulated, cell, death, called, ferroptosis, could, be, involved, products, of, lipid, peroxidation, are, also, elevated, in, ad, brain, compared, with, controls, various, inflammatory, processes, and, cytokines, may, also, have, a, role, in, the, pathology, of, alzheimer, s, disease, inflammation, is, a, general, marker, of, tissue, damage, in, any, disease, and, may, be, either, secondary, to, tissue, damage, in, alzheimer, s, disease, or, a, marker, of, an, immunological, response, there, is, increasing, evidence, of, a, strong, interaction, between, the, neurons, and, the, immunological, mechanisms, in, the, brain, obesity, and, systemic, inflammation, may, interfere, with, immunological, processes, which, promote, disease, progression, alterations, in, the, distribution, of, different, neurotrophic, factors, and, in, the, expression, of, their, receptors, such, as, the, brain, derived, neurotrophic, factor, bdnf, have, been, described, in, alzheimer, s, disease, alzheimer, s, disease, ad, can, only, be, definitively, diagnosed, with, autopsy, findings, in, the, absence, of, autopsy, clinical, diagnoses, of, ad, are, possible, or, probable, based, on, other, findings, up, to, 23, of, those, clinically, diagnosed, with, ad, may, be, misdiagnosed, and, may, have, pathology, suggestive, of, another, condition, with, symptoms, that, mimic, those, of, ad, ad, is, usually, clinically, diagnosed, based, on, the, person, s, medical, history, history, from, relatives, and, behavioral, observations, the, presence, of, characteristic, neurological, and, neuropsychological, features, and, the, absence, of, alternative, conditions, supports, the, diagnosis, advanced, medical, imaging, with, computed, tomography, ct, or, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, and, with, single, photon, emission, computed, tomography, spect, or, positron, emission, tomography, pet, can, be, used, to, help, exclude, other, cerebral, pathology, or, subtypes, of, dementia, moreover, it, may, predict, conversion, from, prodromal, stages, mild, cognitive, impairment, to, alzheimer, s, disease, fda, approved, radiopharmaceutical, diagnostic, agents, used, in, pet, for, alzheimer, s, disease, are, florbetapir, 2012, flutemetamol, 2013, florbetaben, 2014, and, flortaucipir, 2020, because, many, insurance, companies, in, the, united, states, do, not, cover, this, procedure, its, use, in, clinical, practice, is, largely, limited, to, clinical, trials, as, of, 2018, assessment, of, intellectual, functioning, including, memory, testing, can, further, characterise, the, state, of, the, disease, medical, organizations, have, created, diagnostic, criteria, to, ease, and, standardise, the, diagnostic, process, for, practising, physicians, definitive, diagnosis, can, only, be, confirmed, with, post, mortem, evaluations, when, brain, material, is, available, and, can, be, examined, histologically, for, senile, plaques, and, neurofibrillary, tangles, there, are, three, sets, of, criteria, for, the, clinical, diagnoses, of, the, spectrum, of, alzheimer, s, disease, the, 2013, fifth, edition, of, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, 5, the, national, institute, on, aging, alzheimer, s, association, nia, aa, definition, as, revised, in, 2011, and, the, international, working, group, criteria, as, revised, in, 2010, three, broad, time, periods, which, can, span, decades, define, the, progression, of, alzheimer, s, disease, from, the, preclinical, phase, to, mild, cognitive, impairment, mci, followed, by, alzheimer, s, disease, dementia, eight, intellectual, domains, are, most, commonly, impaired, in, ad, memory, language, perceptual, skills, attention, motor, skills, orientation, problem, solving, and, executive, functional, abilities, as, listed, in, the, fourth, text, revision, of, the, dsm, dsm, iv, tr, the, dsm, 5, defines, criteria,

preclinical, mild, cognitive, impairment, mci, and, alzheimer, s, dementia, diagnosis, in, the, preclinical, stage, is, complex, and, focuses, on, asymptomatic, individuals, the, latter, two, stages, describe, individuals, experiencing, symptoms, the, core, clinical, criteria, for, mci, is, used, along, with, identification, of, biomarkers, predominantly, those, for, neuronal, injury, mainly, tau, related, and, amyloid, beta, deposition, the, core, clinical, criteria, itself, rests, on, the, presence, of, cognitive, impairment, without, the, presence, of, comorbidities, the, third, stage, is, divided, into, probable, and, possible, ad, dementia, in, probable, ad, dementia, there, is, steady, impairment, of, cognition, over, time, and, a, memory, related, or, non, memory, related, cognitive, dysfunction, in, possible, ad, dementia, another, causal, disease, such, as, cerebrovascular, disease, is, present, neuropsychological, tests, including, cognitive, tests, such, as, the, mini, mental, state, examination, mmse, the, montreal, cognitive, assessment, moca, and, the, mini, cog, are, widely, used, to, aid, in, diagnosis, of, the, cognitive, impairments, in, ad, these, tests, may, not, always, be, accurate, as, they, lack, sensitivity, to, mild, cognitive, impairment, and, can, be, biased, by, language, or, attention, problems, more, comprehensive, test, arrays, are, necessary, for, high, reliability, of, results, particularly, in, the, earliest, stages, of, the, disease, further, neurological, examinations, are, crucial, in, the, differential, diagnosis, of, alzheimer, s, disease, and, other, diseases, interviews, with, family, members, are, used, in, assessment, caregivers, can, supply, important, information, on, daily, living, abilities, and, on, the, decrease, in, the, person, s, mental, function, a, caregiver, s, viewpoint, is, particularly, important, since, a, person, with, alzheimer, s, disease, is, commonly, unaware, of, their, deficits, many, times, families, have, difficulties, in, the, detection, of, initial, dementia, symptoms, and, may, not, communicate, accurate, information, to, a, physician, supplemental, testing, can, rule, out, other, potentially, treatable, diagnoses, and, help, avoid, misdiagnoses, common, supplemental, tests, include, blood, tests, thyroid, function, tests, as, well, as, tests, to, assess, vitamin, b12, levels, rule, out, neurosyphilis, and, rule, out, metabolic, problems, including, tests, for, kidney, function, electrolyte, levels, and, for, diabetes, mri, or, ct, scans, might, also, be, used, to, rule, out, other, potential, causes, of, the, symptoms, including, tumors, or, strokes, delirium, and, depression, can, be, common, among, individuals, and, are, important, to, rule, out, psychological, tests, for, depression, are, used, since, depression, can, either, be, concurrent, with, ad, see, depression, of, alzheimer, disease, an, early, sign, of, cognitive, impairment, or, even, the, cause, due, to, low, accuracy, the, c, pib, pet, scan, is, not, recommended, as, an, early, diagnostic, tool, or, for, predicting, the, development, of, ad, when, people, show, signs, of, mild, cognitive, impairment, mci, the, use, of, 18, f, fdg, pet, scans, as, a, single, test, to, identify, people, who, may, develop, alzheimer, s, disease, is, not, supported, by, evidence, there, are, no, disease, modifying, treatments, available, to, cure, alzheimer, s, disease, and, because, of, this, ad, research, has, focused, on, interventions, to, prevent, the, onset, and, progression, there, is, no, evidence, that, supports, any, particular, measure, in, preventing, ad, and, studies, of, measures, to, prevent, the, onset, or, progression, have, produced, inconsistent, results, epidemiological, studies, have, proposed, relationships, between, an, individual, s, likelihood, of, developing, ad, and, modifiable, factors, such, as, medications, lifestyle, and, diet, there, are, some, challenges, in, determining, whether, interventions, for, ad, act, as, a, primary, prevention, method, preventing, the, disease, itself, or, a, secondary, prevention, method, identifying, the, early, stages, of, the, disease, these, challenges, include, duration, of, intervention, different, stages, of, disease, at, which, intervention, begins, and, lack, of, standardization, of, inclusion, criteria, regarding, biomarkers, specific, for, ad, further, research, is, needed, to, determine, factors, that, can, help, prevent, ad, cardiovascular, risk, factors, such, as, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes, and, smoking, are, associated, with, a, higher, risk, of, onset, and, worsened, course, of, ad, the, use, of, statins, to, lower, cholesterol, may, be, of, benefit, in, ad, antihypertensive, and, antidiabetic, medications, in, individuals, without, overt, cognitive, impairment, may, decrease, the, risk, of, dementia, by, influencing, cerebrovascular, pathology, more, research, is, needed, to, examine, the, relationship, with, ad, specifically, clarification, of, the, direct, role, medications, play, versus, other, concurrent, lifestyle, changes, diet, exercise, smoking, is, needed, depression, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, for, ad, management, with, antidepressant, medications, may, provide, a, preventative, measure, historically, long, term, usage, of, non, steroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, nsaids, were, thought, to, be, associated, with, a, reduced, likelihood, of, developing, ad, as, it, reduces, inflammation, however, nsaids, do, not, appear, to, be, useful, as, a, treatment, additionally, because, women, have, a, higher, incidence, of, ad, than, men, it, was, once, thought, that, estrogen, deficiency, during, menopause, was, a, risk, factor, however, there, is, a, lack, of, evidence, to, show, that, hormone, replacement, therapy, hrt, in, menopause, decreases, risk, of, cognitive, decline, certain, lifestyle, activities, such, as, physical, and, cognitive, exercises, higher, education, and, occupational, attainment, cigarette, smoking, stress, sleep, and, the, management, of, other, comorbidities, including, diabetes, and, hypertension, may, affect, the, risk, of, developing, ad, physical, exercise, is, associated, with, a, decreased, rate, of, dementia, and, is, effective, in, reducing, symptom, severity, in, those, with, ad, memory, and, cognitive, functions, can, be, improved, with, aerobic, exercises, including, brisk, walking, three, times, weekly, for, forty, minutes, it, may, also, induce, neuroplasticity, of, the, brain, participating, in, mental, exercises, such, as, reading, crossword, puzzles, and, chess, have, shown, a, potential, to, be, preventive, meeting, the, who, recommendations, for, physical, activity, is, associated, with, a, lower, risk, of, ad, higher, education, and, occupational, attainment, and, participation, in, leisure, activities, contribute, to, a, reduced, risk, of, developing, ad, or, of, delaying, the, onset, of, symptoms, this, is, compatible, with, the, cognitive, reserve, theory, which, states, that, some, life, experiences, result, in, more, efficient, neural, functioning, providing, the, individual, a, cognitive, reserve, that, delays, the, onset, of, dementia, manifestations, education, delays, the, onset, of, alzheimer, s, disease, syndrome, without, changing, the, duration, of, the, disease, cessation, in, smoking, may, reduce, risk, of, developing, ad, specifically, in, those, who, carry, the, apoe, 4, allele, the, increased, oxidative, stress, caused, by, smoking, results, in, downstream, inflammatory, or, neurodegenerative, processes, that, may, increase, risk, of, developing, ad, avoidance, of, smoking,

but, the, precise, relationship, is, unclear, it, was, once, thought, that, as, people, get, older, the, risk, of, developing, sleep, disorders, and, ad, independently, increase, but, research, is, examining, whether, sleep, disorders, may, increase, the, prevalence, of, ad, one, theory, is, that, the, mechanisms, to, increase, clearance, of, toxic, substances, including, a, are, active, during, sleep, with, decreased, sleep, a, person, is, increasing, a, production, and, decreasing, a, clearance, resulting, in, a, accumulation, receiving, adequate, sleep, approximately, 7, 8, hours, every, night, has, become, a, potential, lifestyle, intervention, to, prevent, the, development, of, ad, stress, is, a, risk, factor, for, the, development, of, ad, the, mechanism, by, which, stress, predisposes, someone, to, development, of, ad, is, unclear, but, it, is, suggested, that, lifetime, stressors, may, affect, a, person, s, epigenome, leading, to, an, overexpression, or, under, expression, of, specific, genes, although, the, relationship, of, stress, and, ad, is, unclear, strategies, to, reduce, stress, and, relax, the, mind, may, be, helpful, strategies, in, preventing, the, progression, or, alzheimer, s, disease, meditation, for, instance, is, a, helpful, lifestyle, change, to, support, cognition, and, well, being, though, further, research, is, needed, to, assess, long, term, effects, there, is, no, cure, for, ad, available, treatments, offer, relatively, small, symptomatic, benefits, but, remain, palliative, in, nature, treatments, can, be, divided, into, pharmaceutical, psychosocial, and, caregiving, medications, used, to, treat, the, cognitive, symptoms, of, ad, rather, than, the, underlying, cause, include, four, acetylcholinesterase, inhibitors, tacrine, rivastigmine, galantamine, and, donepezil, and, memantine, an, nmda, receptor, antagonist, the, acetylcholinesterase, inhibitors, are, intended, for, those, with, mild, to, severe, ad, whereas, memantine, is, intended, for, those, with, moderate, or, severe, alzheimer, s, disease, the, benefit, from, their, use, is, small, reduction, in, the, activity, of, the, cholinergic, neurons, is, a, well, known, feature, of, ad, acetylcholinesterase, inhibitors, are, employed, to, reduce, the, rate, at, which, acetylcholine, ach, is, broken, down, thereby, increasing, the, concentration, of, ach, in, the, brain, and, combating, the, loss, of, ach, caused, by, the, death, of, cholinergic, neurons, there, is, evidence, for, the, efficacy, of, these, medications, in, mild, to, moderate, ad, and, some, evidence, for, their, use, in, the, advanced, stage, the, use, of, these, drugs, in, mild, cognitive, impairment, has, not, shown, any, effect, in, a, delay, of, the, onset, of, alzheimer, s, disease, the, most, common, side, effects, are, nausea, and, vomiting, both, of, which, are, linked, to, cholinergic, excess, these, side, effects, arise, in, approximately, 10, 20, of, users, are, mild, to, moderate, in, severity, and, can, be, managed, by, slowly, adjusting, medication, doses, less, common, secondary, effects, include, muscle, cramps, decreased, heart, rate, bradycardia, decreased, appetite, and, weight, and, increased, gastric, acid, production, glutamate, is, an, excitatory, neurotransmitter, of, the, nervous, system, although, excessive, amounts, in, the, brain, can, lead, to, cell, death, through, a, process, called, excitotoxicity, which, consists, of, the, overstimulation, of, glutamate, receptors, excitotoxicity, occurs, not, only, in, ad, but, also, in, other, neurological, diseases, such, as, parkinson, s, disease, and, multiple, sclerosis, memantine, is, a, noncompetitive, nmda, receptor, antagonist, first, used, as, an, anti, influenza, agent, it, acts, on, the, glutamatergic, system, by, blocking, nmda, receptors, and, inhibiting, their, overstimulation, by, glutamate, memantine, has, been, shown, to, have, a, small, benefit, in, the, treatment, of, moderate, to, severe, ad, reported, adverse, events, with, memantine, are, infrequent, and, mild, including, hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, headache, and, fatigue, the, combination, of, memantine, and, donepezil, has, been, shown, to, be, of, statistically, significant, but, clinically, marginal, effectiveness, an, extract, of, ginkgo, biloba, known, as, egb, 761, has, been, used, for, treating, ad, and, other, neuropsychiatric, disorders, its, use, is, approved, throughout, europe, the, world, federation, of, biological, psychiatry, guidelines, lists, egb, 761, with, the, same, weight, of, evidence, level, b, given, to, acetylcholinesterase, inhibitors, and, memantine, egb, 761, is, the, only, one, that, showed, improvement, of, symptoms, in, both, ad, and, vascular, dementia, egb, 761, may, have, a, role, either, on, its, own, or, as, an, add, on, if, other, therapies, prove, ineffective, a, 2016, review, concluded, that, the, quality, of, evidence, from, clinical, trials, on, ginkgo, biloba, has, been, insufficient, to, warrant, its, use, for, treating, ad, atypical, antipsychotics, are, modestly, useful, in, reducing, aggression, and, psychosis, in, people, with, ad, but, their, advantages, are, offset, by, serious, adverse, effects, such, as, stroke, movement, difficulties, or, cognitive, decline, when, used, in, the, long, term, they, have, been, shown, to, associate, with, increased, mortality, stopping, antipsychotic, use, in, this, group, of, people, appears, to, be, safe, psychosocial, interventions, are, used, as, an, adjunct, to, pharmaceutical, treatment, and, can, be, classified, within, behavior, emotion, cognition, or, stimulation, oriented, approaches, behavioral, interventions, attempt, to, identify, and, reduce, the, antecedents, and, consequences, of, problem, behaviors, this, approach, has, not, shown, success, in, improving, overall, functioning, but, can, help, to, reduce, some, specific, problem, behaviors, such, as, incontinence, there, is, a, lack, of, high, quality, data, on, the, effectiveness, of, these, techniques, in, other, behavior, problems, such, as, wandering, music, therapy, is, effective, in, reducing, behavioral, and, psychological, symptoms, emotion, oriented, interventions, include, reminiscence, therapy, validation, therapy, supportive, psychotherapy, sensory, integration, also, called, snoezelen, and, simulated, presence, therapy, a, cochrane, review, has, found, no, evidence, that, this, is, effective, reminiscence, therapy, rt, involves, the, discussion, of, past, experiences, individually, or, in, group, many, times, with, the, aid, of, photographs, household, items, music, and, sound, recordings, or, other, familiar, items, from, the, past, a, 2018, review, of, the, effectiveness, of, rt, found, that, effects, were, inconsistent, small, in, size, and, of, doubtful, clinical, significance, and, varied, by, setting, simulated, presence, therapy, spt, is, based, on, attachment, theories, and, involves, playing, a, recording, with, voices, of, the, closest, relatives, of, the, person, with, ad, there, is, partial, evidence, indicating, that, spt, may, reduce, challenging, behaviors, the, aim, of, cognition, oriented, treatments, which, include, reality, orientation, and, cognitive, retraining, is, the, reduction, of, cognitive, deficits, reality, orientation, consists, of, the, presentation, of, information, about, time, place, or, person, to, ease, the, understanding, of, the, person, about, its, surroundings, and, his, or, her, place, in, them, on, the, other, hand, cognitive, retraining, tries, to, improve, impaired, capacities, by, exercising, mental, abilities, both, have, shown, some, efficacy, improving, cognitive, capacities, stimulation, oriented, treatments, include, art, music, and, pet, therapies, exercise, and, any, other, kind, of, recreational, activities, stimulation, has, modest, support, for, improving, behavior, mood, and, to, a, lesser, extent, function, nevertheless, as, important, as, these, effects, are, the, main, support, for, the, use, of, stimulation, therapies, is, the, change, in, the, person, s, routine, since, ad, has, no, cure, and, it, gradually, renders, people, incapable, of, tending, to, their, own, needs, caregiving, is, essentially, the, treatment, and, must, be, carefully, managed, over, the, course, of, the, disease, during, the, early, and, moderate, stages, modifications, to, the, living, environment, and, lifestyle, can, increase, safety, and, reduce, caretaker, burden, examples, of, such, modifications, are, the, adherence, to, simplified, routines, the, placing, of, safety, locks, the, labeling, of, household, items, to, cue, the, person, with, the, disease, or, the, use, of, modified, daily, life, objects, if, eating, becomes, problematic, food, will, need, to, be, prepared, in, smaller, pieces, or, even, pur, ed, when, swallowing, difficulties, arise, the, use, of, feeding, tubes, may, be, required, in, such, cases, the, medical, efficacy, and, ethics, of, continuing, feeding, is, an, important, consideration, of, the, caregivers, and, family, members, the, use, of, physical, restraints, is, rarely, indicated, in, any, stage, of, the, disease, although, there, are, situations, when, they, are, necessary, to, prevent, harm, to, the, person, with, alzheimer, s, disease, or, their, caregivers, during, the, final, stages, of, the, disease, treatment, is, centred, on, relieving, discomfort, until, death, often, with, the, help, of, hospice, diet, may, be, a, modifiable, risk, factor, for, the, development, of, alzheimer, s, disease, the, mediterranean, diet, and, the, dash, diet, are, both, associated, with, less, cognitive, decline, a, different, approach, has, been, to, incorporate, elements, of, both, of, these, diets, into, one, known, as, the, mind, diet, studies, of, individual, dietary, components, minerals, and, supplements, are, conflicting, as, to, whether, they, prevent, ad, or, cognitive, decline, the, early, stages, of, ad, are, difficult, to, diagnose, a, definitive, diagnosis, is, usually, made, once, cognitive, impairment, compromises, daily, living, activities, although, the, person, may, still, be, living, independently, the, symptoms, will, progress, from, mild, cognitive, problems, such, as, memory, loss, through, increasing, stages, of, cognitive, and, non, cognitive, disturbances, eliminating, any, possibility, of, independent, living, especially, in, the, late, stages, of, the, disease, life, expectancy, of, people, with, ad, is, reduced, the, normal, life, expectancy, for, 60, to, 70, years, old, is, 23, to, 15, years, for, 90, years, old, it, is, 4, 5, years, following, ad, diagnosis, it, ranges, from, 7, to, 10, years, for, those, in, their, 60s, and, early, 70s, a, loss, of, 13, to, 8, years, to, only, about, 3, years, or, less, a, loss, of, 1, 5, years, for, those, in, their, 90s, fewer, than, 3, of, people, live, more, than, fourteen, years, after, diagnosis, disease, features, significantly, associated, with, reduced, survival, are, an, increased, severity, of, cognitive, impairment, decreased, functional, level, disturbances, in, the, neurological, examination, history, of, falls, malnutrition, dehydration, and, weight, loss, other, coincident, diseases, such, as, heart, problems, diabetes, or, history, of, alcohol, abuse, are, also, related, with, shortened, survival, while, the, earlier, the, age, at, onset, the, higher, the, total, survival, years, life, expectancy, is, particularly, reduced, when, compared, to, the, healthy, population, among, those, who, are, younger, men, have, a, less, favourable, survival, prognosis, than, women, aspiration, pneumonia, is, the, most, frequent, immediate, cause, of, death, brought, by, ad, while, the, reasons, behind, the, lower, prevalence, of, cancer, in, ad, patients, remain, unclear, some, researchers, hypothesize, that, biological, mechanisms, shared, by, both, diseases, might, play, a, role, however, this, requires, further, investigation, two, main, measures, are, used, in, epidemiological, studies, incidence, and, prevalence, incidence, is, the, number, of, new, cases, per, unit, of, person, time, at, risk, usually, number, of, new, cases, per, thousand, person, years, while, prevalence, is, the, total, number, of, cases, of, the, disease, in, the, population, at, any, given, time, regarding, incidence, cohort, longitudinal, studies, studies, where, a, disease, free, population, is, followed, over, the, years, provide, rates, between, 10, and, 15, per, thousand, person, years, for, all, dementias, and, 5, 8, for, ad, which, means, that, half, of, new, dementia, cases, each, year, are, alzheimer, s, disease, advancing, age, is, a, primary, risk, factor, for, the, disease, and, incidence, rates, are, not, equal, for, all, ages, every, 5, years, after, the, age, of, 65, the, risk, of, acquiring, the, disease, approximately, doubles, increasing, from, 3, to, as, much, as, 69, per, thousand, person, years, females, with, ad, are, more, common, than, males, but, this, difference, is, likely, due, to, women, s, longer, life, spans, when, adjusted, for, age, both, sexes, are, affected, by, alzheimer, s, at, equal, rates, in, the, united, states, the, risk, of, dying, from, ad, in, 2010, was, 26, higher, among, the, non, hispanic, white, population, than, among, the, non, hispanic, black, population, and, the, hispanic, population, had, a, 30, lower, risk, than, the, non, hispanic, white, population, however, much, ad, research, remains, to, be, done, in, minority, groups, such, as, the, african, american, east, asian, and, hispanic, latino, populations, studies, have, shown, that, these, groups, are, underrepresented, in, clinical, trials, and, do, not, have, the, same, risk, of, developing, ad, when, carrying, certain, genetic, risk, factors, i, e, apoe4, compared, to, their, caucasian, counterparts, the, prevalence, of, ad, in, populations, is, dependent, upon, factors, including, incidence, and, survival, since, the, incidence, of, ad, increases, with, age, prevalence, depends, on, the, mean, age, of, the, population, for, which, prevalence, is, given, in, the, united, states, in, 2020, ad, dementia, prevalence, was, estimated, to, be, 5, 3, for, those, in, the, 60, 74, age, group, with, the, rate, increasing, to, 13, 8, in, the, 74, 84, group, and, to, 34, 6, in, those, greater, than, 85, prevalence, rates, in, some, less, developed, regions, around, the, globe, are, lower, both, the, prevalence, and, incidence, rates, of, ad, are, steadily, increasing, however, the, prevalence, rate, is, estimated, to, triple, by, 2050, reaching, 152, million, compared, to, the, 50, million, people, with, ad, globally, in, 2020, the, ancient, greek, and, roman, philosophers, and, physicians, associated, old, age, with, increasing, dementia, it, was, not, until, 1901, that, german, psychiatrist, alois, alzheimer, identified, the, first, case, of, what, became, known, as, alzheimer, s, disease, named, after, him, in, a, fifty, year, old, woman, he, called, auguste, d, he, followed, her, case, until, she, died, in, 1906, when, he, first, reported, publicly, on, it, during, the, next, five, years, eleven, similar, cases, were, reported, in, the, medical, literature, some, of, them, already, using, the, term, alzheimer, s, disease, the, disease, was, first, described, as, a, distinctive, disease, by, emil, kraepelin, after, suppressing, some, of, the, clinical, delusions, and, hallucinations, and, pathological, features, arteriosclerotic, changes, contained, in, the, original, report, of, auguste, d, he, included, alzheimer, s, disease, also, named, presenile, dementia, by, kraepelin, as, a, subtype, of, senile, dementia, in, the, eighth, edition, of, his, textbook, of, psychiatry, published, on, 15, july, 1910, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, the, diagnosis, of, alzheimer, s, disease, was, reserved, for, individuals, between, the, ages, of, 45, and, 65, who, developed, symptoms, of, dementia, the, terminology, changed, after, 1977, when, a, conference, on, alzheimer, s, disease, concluded, that, the, clinical, and, pathological, manifestations, of, presenile, and, senile, dementia, were, almost, identical, although, the, authors, also, added, that, this, did, not, rule, out, the, possibility, that, they, had, different, causes, this, eventually, led, to, the, diagnosis, of, alzheimer, s, disease, independent, of, age, the, term, senile, dementia, of, the, alzheimer, type, sdat, was, used, for, a, time, to, describe, the, condition, in, those, over, 65, with, classical, alzheimer, s, disease, being, used, to, describe, those, who, were, younger, eventually, the, term, alzheimer, s, disease, was, formally, adopted, in, medical, nomenclature, to, describe, individuals, of, all, ages, with, a, characteristic, common, symptom, pattern, disease, course, and, neuropathology, the, national, institute, of, neurological, and, communicative, disorders, and, stroke, nincds, and, the, alzheimer, s, disease, and, related, disorders, association, adrda, now, known, as, the, alzheimer, s, association, established, the, most, commonly, used, nincds, adrda, alzheimer, s, criteria, for, diagnosis, in, 1984, extensively, updated, in, 2007, these, criteria, require, that, the, presence, of, cognitive, impairment, and, a, suspected, dementia, syndrome, be, confirmed, by, neuropsychological, testing, for, a, clinical, diagnosis, of, possible, or, probable, alzheimer, s, disease, a, histopathologic, confirmation, including, a, microscopic, examination, of, brain, tissue, is, required, for, a, definitive, diagnosis, good, statistical, reliability, and, validity, have, been, shown, between, the, diagnostic, criteria, and, definitive, histopathological, confirmation, dementia, and, specifically, alzheimer, s, disease, may, be, among, the, most, costly, diseases, for, societies, worldwide, as, populations, age, these, costs, will, probably, increase, and, become, an, important, social, problem, and, economic, burden, costs, associated, with, ad, include, direct, and, indirect, medical, costs, which, vary, between, countries, depending, on, social, care, for, a, person, with, ad, direct, costs, include, doctor, visits, hospital, care, medical, treatments, nursing,
