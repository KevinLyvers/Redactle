see, text, ara, is, a, neotropical, genus, of, macaws, with, eight, extant, species, and, at, least, two, extinct, species, the, genus, name, was, coined, by, french, naturalist, bernard, germain, de, lac, p, de, in, 1799, it, gives, its, name, to, and, is, part, of, the, arini, or, tribe, of, neotropical, parrots, the, genus, name, ara, is, derived, from, the, tupi, word, ar, an, onomatopoeia, of, the, sound, a, macaw, makes, the, ara, macaws, are, large, striking, parrots, with, long, tails, long, narrow, wings, and, vividly, coloured, plumage, they, all, have, a, characteristic, bare, face, patch, around, the, eyes, males, and, females, have, similar, plumage, many, of, its, members, are, popular, in, the, pet, trade, and, bird, smuggling, is, a, threat, to, several, species, the, genus, ara, was, erected, by, the, french, naturalist, bernard, germain, de, lac, p, de, in, 1799, the, type, species, was, designated, as, the, scarlet, macaw, ara, macao, by, robert, ridgway, in, 1916, the, genus, name, is, from, ar, meaning, macaw, in, the, tupi, language, of, brazil, the, word, is, an, onomatopoeia, based, on, the, sound, of, their, call, for, many, years, the, genus, contained, additional, species, but, it, was, split, to, create, three, additional, genera, orthopsittaca, primolius, and, diopsittaca, orthopsittaca, and, diopsittaca, are, monotypic, and, are, morphologically, and, behaviourally, different, whereas, the, three, primolius, macaws, are, green, and, smaller, there, are, eight, surviving, species, two, extinct, species, that, died, out, during, modern, times, and, a, third, extinct, species, known, only, from, subfossil, remains, the, last, confirmed, sighting, of, the, extinct, cuban, macaw, was, in, 1864, when, one, was, shot, several, skins, of, the, cuban, macaw, are, preserved, in, museums, but, none, of, its, eggs, have, survived, several, hypothetical, extinct, species, of, the, genus, ara, have, been, postulated, based, on, very, little, evidence, they, may, have, been, distinct, species, or, familiar, parrots, that, were, imported, onto, an, island, and, later, presumed, to, have, a, separate, identity, the, ara, macaws, are, large, parrots, ranging, from, 46, 51, cm, 18, 20, in, in, length, and, 285, to, 287, g, 10, oz, in, weight, in, the, chestnut, fronted, macaw, to, 90, 95, cm, 35, 5, 37, 5, in, and, 1, 708, g, 60, 2, oz, in, the, green, winged, macaw, the, wings, of, these, macaws, are, long, and, narrow, which, is, typical, for, species, of, parrot, which, travel, long, distances, in, order, to, forage, they, have, a, massive, downward, curved, upper, mandible, and, a, patch, of, pale, skin, around, the, eye, that, extends, to, base, of, the, beak, the, skin, patch, bears, minute, feathers, arranged, in, lines, that, form, a, pattern, over, the, otherwise, bare, skin, in, all, species, of, the, genus, except, the, scarlet, macaw, in, which, the, skin, is, bare, in, most, species, the, bill, is, black, but, the, scarlet, macaw, and, green, winged, macaw, have, a, predominantly, horn, coloured, upper, mandible, and, a, black, lower, one, the, colours, in, the, plumage, of, the, ara, macaws, are, spectacular, four, species, are, predominantly, green, two, species, are, mostly, blue, and, yellow, and, three, species, including, the, extinct, cuban, macaw, are, mostly, red, there, is, no, sexual, dimorphism, in, the, plumage, and, the, plumage, of, the, juveniles, is, similar, to, adults, although, slightly, duller, in, some, species, the, ara, macaws, have, a, neotropical, distribution, from, mexico, to, argentina, the, centre, of, ara, distribution, is, the, amazon, basin, and, the, panama, colombia, border, region, each, with, as, many, as, four, species, found, together, marginally, five, where, the, military, macaw, approach, the, western, amazon, seven, species, are, found, in, bolivia, but, no, single, locality, in, that, or, any, other, country, surpasses, four, species, the, most, widespread, species, the, scarlet, macaw, is, or, was, distributed, throughout, large, parts, of, central, america, and, the, amazon, on, the, other, hand, the, blue, throated, macaw, and, the, red, fronted, macaw, have, tiny, distributions, in, bolivia, the, overall, range, of, many, species, and, the, genus, as, a, whole, has, declined, in, historical, times, due, to, human, activities, the, military, macaw, is, distributed, from, northern, mexico, to, northern, argentina, but, the, distribution, is, discontinuous, with, populations, in, mexico, a, large, gap, then, a, population, in, the, venezuelan, coastal, range, and, a, population, along, the, andes, from, western, venezuela, to, northern, argentina, the, blue, and, yellow, macaw, was, extirpated, from, trinidad, in, the, 1960s, but, was, later, reintroduced, and, several, hypothetical, species, apparently, became, extinct, in, the, islands, of, the, caribbean, the, ara, macaws, are, generally, fairly, adaptable, in, their, habitat, requirements, this, reaches, its, extreme, in, the, scarlet, macaw, which, as, suggested, in, its, widespread, distribution, uses, most, habitat, types, from, humid, rainforest, to, open, woodlands, to, savannah, the, only, requirement, is, sufficient, large, trees, which, is, where, they, obtain, their, food, and, breeding, holes, the, other, species, are, slightly, more, narrow, in, their, habitat, choices, but, the, need, for, large, trees, is, universal, the, blue, throated, macaw, generally, inhabits, forest, islands, in, the, savanna, and, the, red, fronted, macaw, prefers, arid, scrub, and, cactus, woodland, within, their, range, birds, may, travel, widely, seasonally, in, search, of, food, they, do, not, undertake, large, scale, migrations, but, instead, more, local, movements, amongst, a, range, of, different, habitats, like, all, macaws, and, most, parrots, seeds, and, fruit, are, the, major, part, of, the, diet, of, the, genus, ara, the, particular, species, and, range, of, diet, varies, from, species, to, species, unlike, many, birds, macaws, are, seed, predators, not, seed, dispersers, and, use, their, immensely, strong, beaks, to, open, even, the, hardest, shells, their, diet, overlaps, with, that, of, some, monkey, species, in, one, study, of, green, winged, macaws, in, venezuela, they, shared, many, of, the, same, trees, as, bearded, sakis, although, in, some, cases, they, ate, the, seeds, at, an, earlier, stage, of, ripeness, than, the, sakis, when, they, contained, more, poison, macaws, like, other, parrots, may, consume, clay, to, absorb, toxic, compounds, produced, by, some, poisons, as, well, the, toxic, compounds, of, some, foods, may, be, neutralized, by, compounds, such, as, tannins, found, in, other, foods, consumed, at, the, same, time, like, almost, all, parrots, the, ara, macaws, are, cavity, nesters, the, majority, of, species, nest, in, cavities, in, trees, either, live, or, dead, natural, holes, in, trees, may, be, used, particularly, those, in, dead, trees, otherwise, holes, created, by, other, species, in, mexico, military, macaws, still, use, the, cavities, excavated, by, the, now, critically, endangered, imperial, woodpecker, in, addition, to, nesting, in, trees, the, military, macaw, and, green, winged, macaw, will, also, nest, in, natural, fissures, in, cliffs, this, nesting, habitat, is, the, only, one, used, by, the, red, fronted, macaws, as, large, enough, trees, are, absent, in, its, arid, range, macaws, are, known, to, have, been, transported, between, the, caribbean, islands, and, from, mainland, south, america, both, in, historic, times, by, europeans, and, in, prehistoric, times, by, paleoamericans, parrots, were, important, to, the, culture, of, native, caribbeans, the, birds, were, traded, between, islands, and, were, among, the, gifts, offered, to, christopher, columbus, when, he, reached, the, bahamas, in, 1492, it, is, therefore, difficult, to, determine, whether, or, not, the, numerous, historical, records, of, macaws, on, these, islands, mention, distinct, endemic, species, since, they, could, have, been, escaped, individuals, or, feral, populations, of, foreign, macaws, of, known, species, that, had, been, transported, there, as, many, as, thirteen, extinct, macaws, have, at, times, been, suggested, to, have, lived, on, the, islands, until, recently, only, three, endemic, caribbean, ara, macaw, species, are, known, from, physical, remains, the, cuban, macaw, ara, tricolor, is, known, from, nineteen, museum, skins, and, subfossils, the, saint, croix, macaw, ara, autochthones, is, only, known, from, subfossils, and, the, lesser, antillean, macaw, ara, guadeloupensis, is, known, from, subfossils, and, reports, no, endemic, caribbean, macaws, remain, today, and, they, were, likely, all, driven, to, extinction, by, humans, some, in, historic, and, others, in, prehistoric, times, in, addition, to, the, three, species, known, from, remains, several, hypothetical, extinct, ara, macaws, were, only, based, on, contemporary, accounts, but, are, considered, dubious, today, many, of, these, were, named, by, walter, rothschild, in, the, early, 20th, century, who, had, a, tendency, to, name, species, based, on, little, tangible, evidence, among, others, the, red, headed, macaw, ara, erythrocephala, and, jamaican, red, macaw, ara, gossei, were, named, for, accounts, of, macaws, on, jamaica, the, martinique, macaw, ara, martinicus, was, from, martinique, and, the, dominican, green, and, yellow, macaw, ara, atwoodi, was, supposed, to, come, from, dominica, other, species, have, been, mentioned, as, well, but, many, never, received, binomials, or, are, considered, junior, synonyms, of, other, species, woods, and, steadman, defended, the, validity, of, most, named, caribbean, macaw, species, and, believed, each, greater, and, lesser, antillean, island, had, their, own, endemic, species, olson, and, ma, z, doubted, the, validity, of, all, the, hypothetical, macaws, but, suggested, that, the, island, of, hispaniola, would, be, the, most, likely, place, for, another, macaw, species, to, have, existed, due, to, the, large, land, area, though, no, descriptions, or, remains, of, such, are, known, they, suggested, such, a, species, could, have, been, driven, to, extinction, prior, to, the, arrival, of, europeans, the, identity, and, distribution, of, indigenous, macaws, in, the, caribbean, is, only, likely, to, be, further, resolved, through, palaeontological, discoveries, and, examination, of, contemporary, reports, and, artwork
