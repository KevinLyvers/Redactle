ursus, meles, linnaeus, 1758, the, european, badger, meles, meles, also, known, as, the, eurasian, badger, is, a, badger, species, in, the, family, mustelidae, native, to, europe, and, west, asia, and, parts, of, central, asia, it, is, classified, as, least, concern, on, the, iucn, red, list, as, it, has, a, wide, range, and, a, large, stable, population, size, which, is, thought, to, be, increasing, in, some, regions, several, subspecies, are, recognized, with, the, nominate, subspecies, m, m, meles, predominating, in, most, of, europe, in, europe, where, no, other, badger, species, commonly, occurs, it, is, generally, just, called, the, badger, the, european, badger, is, a, powerfully, built, black, white, brown, and, grey, animal, with, a, small, head, a, stocky, body, small, black, eyes, and, a, short, tail, its, weight, varies, being, 7, 13, kg, 15, 29, lb, in, spring, but, building, up, to, 15, 17, kg, 33, 37, lb, in, autumn, before, the, winter, sleep, period, it, is, nocturnal, and, is, a, social, burrowing, animal, that, sleeps, during, the, day, in, one, of, several, setts, in, its, territorial, range, these, burrows, have, multiple, chambers, and, entrances, and, are, extensive, systems, of, underground, passages, of, 35, 81, m, 115, 266, ft, length, they, house, several, badger, families, that, use, these, setts, for, decades, badgers, are, fussy, over, the, cleanliness, of, their, burrow, carrying, in, fresh, bedding, and, removing, soiled, material, and, they, defecate, in, latrines, strategically, situated, outside, their, setts, or, en, route, to, other, setts, although, classified, as, a, carnivore, the, european, badger, is, an, omnivore, feeding, on, a, wide, variety, of, plant, and, animal, foods, including, earthworms, large, insects, small, mammals, carrion, cereals, and, tubers, litters, of, up, to, five, cubs, are, produced, in, spring, the, young, are, weaned, a, few, months, later, but, usually, remain, within, the, family, group, the, european, badger, has, been, known, to, share, its, burrow, with, other, species, such, as, rabbits, red, foxes, and, raccoon, dogs, but, it, can, be, ferocious, when, provoked, a, trait, which, has, been, exploited, in, the, now, illegal, blood, sport, of, badger, baiting, like, many, wild, and, domesticated, species, of, mammals, badgers, can, be, carriers, of, bovine, tuberculosis, which, can, spread, between, species, and, can, be, particularly, detrimental, to, cattle, in, england, badger, populations, are, culled, to, try, to, reduce, the, incidence, of, bovine, tuberculosis, in, cattle, although, the, efficacy, of, this, practice, is, strongly, disputed, and, badger, culls, are, widely, considered, cruel, and, inhumane, the, source, of, the, word, badger, is, uncertain, the, oxford, english, dictionary, states, it, probably, derives, from, badge, ard, a, reference, to, the, white, mark, on, its, forehead, that, resembles, a, badge, and, may, date, to, the, early, 16th, century, the, french, word, b, cheur, digger, has, also, been, suggested, as, a, source, a, male, badger, is, a, boar, a, female, is, a, sow, and, a, young, badger, is, a, cub, a, badger, s, home, is, called, a, sett, badger, colonies, are, often, called, clans, the, far, older, name, brock, old, english, brocc, scots, brock, is, a, celtic, loanword, cf, gaelic, broc, and, welsh, broch, from, proto, celtic, brokko, meaning, grey, the, proto, germanic, term, was, ahsu, cf, german, dachs, dutch, das, norwegian, svin, toks, early, modern, english, dasse, probably, from, the, pie, root, tek, to, construct, which, suggests, that, the, badger, was, named, after, its, digging, of, setts, tunnels, the, germanic, term, ahsu, became, taxus, or, tax, nis, in, latin, glosses, replacing, m, l, s, marten, or, badger, and, from, these, words, the, common, romance, terms, for, the, animal, evolved, italian, tasso, french, tesson, taisson, tasson, now, blaireau, is, more, common, catalan, toix, spanish, tej, n, portuguese, texugo, except, asturian, melandru, until, the, mid, 18th, century, european, badgers, were, variously, known, in, english, as, brock, pate, grey, and, bawson, the, name, bawson, is, derived, from, bawsened, which, refers, to, something, striped, with, white, pate, is, a, local, name, that, was, once, popular, in, northern, england, the, name, badget, was, once, common, but, only, used, in, norfolk, while, earth, dog, was, used, in, southern, ireland, the, badger, is, commonly, referred, to, in, welsh, as, a, mochyn, daear, earth, pig, ursus, meles, was, the, scientific, name, used, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, who, described, the, badger, in, his, work, systema, naturae, the, species, likely, evolved, from, the, chinese, meles, thorali, of, the, early, pleistocene, the, modern, species, originated, during, the, early, middle, pleistocene, with, fossil, sites, occurring, in, episcopia, grombasek, s, ssenborn, hundsheim, erpfingen, kon, prusy, mosbach, 2, and, str, nsk, sk, la, a, comparison, between, fossil, and, living, specimens, shows, a, marked, progressive, adaptation, to, omnivory, namely, in, the, increase, in, the, molars, surface, areas, and, the, modification, of, the, carnassials, occasionally, badger, bones, are, discovered, in, earlier, strata, due, to, the, burrowing, habits, of, the, species, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, several, badger, type, specimens, were, described, and, proposed, as, subspecies, as, of, 2005, eight, subspecies, were, recognized, as, valid, taxa, but, four, canescens, arcalus, rhodius, severzovi, are, now, considered, to, belong, to, a, distinct, species, the, caucasian, badger, m, canescens, taxus, boddaert, 1785, alba, gmelin, 1788, maculata, gmelin, 1788, vulgaris, tiedemann,

situated, on, the, western, bank, the, boundary, between, the, ranges, of, the, european, and, caucasian, badgers, is, in, the, north, caucasus, but, a, clear, boundary, has, not, been, defined, and, they, are, sympatric, in, some, regions, potentially, forming, a, hybrid, zone, they, are, common, in, european, russia, with, 30, 000, individuals, having, been, recorded, there, in, 1990, they, are, abundant, and, increasing, throughout, their, range, partly, due, to, a, reduction, in, rabies, in, central, europe, in, the, uk, badgers, experienced, a, 77, increase, in, numbers, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, the, badger, population, in, great, britain, in, 2012, is, estimated, to, be, 300, 000, the, european, badger, is, found, in, deciduous, and, mixed, woodlands, clearings, spinneys, pastureland, and, scrub, including, mediterranean, maquis, shrubland, it, has, adapted, to, life, in, suburban, areas, and, urban, parks, although, not, to, the, extent, of, red, foxes, in, mountainous, areas, it, occurs, up, to, an, altitude, of, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, european, badgers, are, the, most, social, of, badgers, forming, groups, of, six, adults, on, average, though, larger, associations, of, up, to, 23, individuals, have, been, recorded, group, size, may, be, related, to, habitat, composition, under, optimal, conditions, badger, territories, can, be, as, small, as, 30, ha, 74, acres, but, may, be, as, large, as, 150, ha, 370, acres, in, marginal, areas, badger, territories, can, be, identified, by, the, presence, of, communal, latrines, and, well, worn, paths, it, is, mainly, males, that, are, involved, in, territorial, aggression, a, hierarchical, social, system, is, thought, to, exist, among, badgers, and, large, powerful, boars, seem, to, assert, dominance, over, smaller, males, large, boars, sometimes, intrude, into, neighbouring, territories, during, the, main, mating, season, in, early, spring, sparring, and, more, vicious, fights, generally, result, from, territorial, defense, in, the, breeding, season, however, in, general, animals, within, and, outside, a, group, show, considerable, tolerance, of, each, other, boars, tend, to, mark, their, territories, more, actively, than, sows, with, their, territorial, activity, increasing, during, the, mating, season, in, early, spring, badgers, groom, each, other, very, thoroughly, with, their, claws, and, teeth, grooming, may, have, a, social, function, they, are, crepuscular, and, nocturnal, in, habits, aggression, among, badgers, is, largely, associated, with, territorial, defence, and, mating, when, fighting, they, bite, each, other, on, the, neck, and, rump, while, running, and, chasing, each, other, and, injuries, incurred, in, such, fights, can, be, severe, and, sometimes, fatal, when, attacked, by, dogs, or, sexually, excited, badgers, may, raise, their, tails, and, fluff, up, their, fur, european, badgers, have, an, extensive, vocal, repertoire, when, threatened, they, emit, deep, growls, and, when, fighting, make, low, kekkering, noises, they, bark, when, surprised, whicker, when, playing, or, in, distress, and, emit, a, piercing, scream, when, alarmed, or, frightened, like, other, badger, species, european, badgers, are, burrowing, animals, however, the, dens, they, construct, called, setts, are, the, most, complex, and, are, passed, on, from, generation, to, generation, the, number, of, exits, in, one, sett, can, vary, from, a, few, to, fifty, these, setts, can, be, vast, and, can, sometimes, accommodate, multiple, families, when, this, happens, each, family, occupies, its, own, passages, and, nesting, chambers, some, setts, may, have, exits, which, are, only, used, in, times, of, danger, or, play, a, typical, passage, has, a, 22, 63, cm, 8, 7, 24, 8, in, wide, base, and, a, 14, 32, cm, 5, 5, 12, 6, in, height, three, sleeping, chambers, occur, in, a, family, unit, some, of, which, are, open, at, both, ends, the, nesting, chamber, is, located, 5, 10, m, 16, 33, ft, from, the, opening, and, is, situated, more, than, a, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, underground, in, some, cases, 2, 3, m, 7, ft, 7, in, generally, the, passages, are, 35, 81, m, 115, 266, ft, long, the, nesting, chamber, is, on, average, 74, cm, 76, cm, 29, in, 30, in, and, are, 38, cm, 15, in, high, badgers, dig, and, collect, bedding, throughout, the, year, particularly, in, autumn, and, spring, sett, maintenance, is, usually, carried, out, by, subordinate, sows, and, dominant, boars, the, chambers, are, frequently, lined, with, bedding, brought, in, on, dry, nights, which, consists, of, grass, bracken, straw, leaves, and, moss, up, to, 30, bundles, can, be, carried, to, the, sett, on, a, single, night, european, badgers, are, fastidiously, clean, animals, which, regularly, clear, out, and, discard, old, bedding, during, the, winter, they, may, take, their, bedding, outside, on, sunny, mornings, and, retrieve, it, later, in, the, day, spring, cleaning, is, connected, with, the, birth, of, cubs, and, may, occur, several, times, during, the, summer, to, prevent, parasite, levels, building, up, if, a, badger, dies, within, the, sett, its, conspecifics, will, seal, off, the, chamber, and, dig, a, new, one, some, badgers, will, drag, their, dead, out, of, the, sett, and, bury, them, outside, a, sett, is, almost, invariably, located, near, a, tree, which, is, used, by, badgers, for, stretching, or, claw, scraping, badgers, defecate, in, latrines, which, are, located, near, the, sett, and, at, strategic, locations, on, territorial, boundaries, or, near, places, with, abundant, food, supplies, in, extreme, cases, when, there, is, a, lack, of, suitable, burrowing, grounds, badgers, may, move, into, haystacks, in, winter, they, may, share, their, setts, with, red, foxes, or, european, rabbits, the, badgers, may, provide, protection, for, the, rabbits, against, other, predators, the, rabbits, usually, avoid, predation, by, the, badgers, by, inhabiting, smaller, hard, to, reach, chambers, estrus, in, european, badgers, lasts, four, to, six, days, and, may, occur, throughout, the, year, though, there, is, a, peak, in, spring, sexual, maturity, in, boars, is, usually, attained, at, the, age, of, twelve, to, fifteen, months, but, this, can, range, from, nine, months, to, two, years, males, are, normally, fecund, during, january, may, with, spermatogenesis, declining, in, summer, sows, usually, begin, ovulating, in, their, second, year, though, some, exceptionally, begin, at, nine, months, they, can, mate, at, any, time, of, the, year, though, the, main, peak, occurs, in, february, may, when, mature, sows, are, in, postpartal, estrus, and, young, animals, experience, their, first, estrus, matings, occurring, outside, this, period, typically, occur, in, sows, which, either, failed, to, mate, earlier, in, the, year, or, matured, slowly, badgers, are, usually, monogamous, boars, typically, mate, with, one, female, for, life, whereas, sows, have, been, known, to, mate, with, more, than, one, male, mating, lasts, for, fifteen, to, sixty, minutes, though, the, pair, may, briefly, copulate, for, a, minute, or, two, when, the, sow, is, not, in, estrus, a, delay, of, two, to, nine, months, precedes, the, fertilized, eggs, implanting, into, the, wall, of, the, uterus, though, matings, in, december, can, result, in, immediate, implantation, ordinarily, implantation, happens, in, december, with, a, gestation, period, lasting, seven, weeks, cubs, are, usually, born, in, mid, january, to, mid, march, within, underground, chambers, containing, bedding, in, areas, where, the, countryside, is, waterlogged, cubs, may, be, born, above, ground, in, buildings, typically, only, dominant, sows, can, breed, as, they, suppress, the, reproduction, of, subordinate, females, the, average, litter, consists, of, one, to, five, cubs, although, many, cubs, are, sired, by, resident, males, up, to, 54, can, be, fathered, by, boars, from, different, colonies, dominant, sows, may, kill, the, cubs, of, subordinates, cubs, are, born, pink, with, greyish, silvery, fur, and, fused, eyelids, neonatal, badgers, are, 12, cm, 4, 7, in, in, body, length, on, average, and, weigh, 75, to, 132, g, 2, 6, to, 4, 7, oz, with, cubs, from, large, litters, being, smaller, by, three, to, five, days, their, claws, become, pigmented, and, individual, dark, hairs, begin, to, appear, their, eyes, open, at, four, to, five, weeks, and, their, milk, teeth, erupt, about, the, same, time, they, emerge, from, their, setts, at, eight, weeks, of, age, and, begin, to, be, weaned, at, twelve, weeks, though, they, may, still, suckle, until, they, are, four, to, five, months, old, subordinate, females, assist, the, mother, in, guarding, feeding, and, grooming, the, cubs, cubs, fully, develop, their, adult, coats, at, six, to, nine, weeks, in, areas, with, medium, to, high, badger, populations, dispersal, from, the, natal, group, is, uncommon, though, badgers, may, temporarily, visit, other, colonies, badgers, can, live, for, up, to, about, fifteen, years, in, the, wild, badgers, begin, to, prepare, for, winter, sleep, during, late, summer, by, accumulating, fat, reserves, which, reach, a, peak, in, october, during, this, period, the, sett, is, cleaned, and, the, nesting, chamber, is, filled, with, bedding, upon, retiring, to, sleep, badgers, block, their, sett, entrances, with, dry, leaves, and, earth, they, typically, stop, leaving, their, setts, once, snow, has, fallen, in, russia, and, the, nordic, countries, european, badgers, retire, for, winter, sleep, from, late, october, to, mid, november, and, emerge, from, their, setts, in, march, and, early, april, in, areas, such, as, england, and, transcaucasia, where, winters, are, less, harsh, badgers, either, forgo, winter, sleep, entirely, or, spend, long, periods, underground, emerging, in, mild, spells, european, badgers, are, among, the, least, carnivorous, members, of, the, carnivora, they, are, highly, adaptable, and, opportunistic, omnivores, whose, diet, encompasses, a, wide, range, of, animals, and, plants, earthworms, are, their, most, important, food, source, followed, by, large, insects, carrion, cereals, fruit, and, small, mammals, including, rabbits, mice, rats, voles, shrews, moles, and, hedgehogs, insect, prey, includes, chafers, dung, and, ground, beetles, caterpillars, leatherjackets, and, the, nests, of, wasps, and, bumblebees, they, are, able, to, destroy, wasp, nests, consuming, the, occupants, combs,

winter, and, during, droughts, badgers, characteristically, capture, large, numbers, of, one, food, type, in, each, hunt, generally, they, do, not, eat, more, than, 0, 5, kg, 1, 1, lb, of, food, per, day, with, young, specimens, yet, to, attain, one, year, of, age, eating, more, than, adults, an, adult, badger, weighing, 15, kg, 33, lb, eats, a, quantity, of, food, equal, to, 3, 4, of, its, body, weight, badgers, typically, eat, prey, on, the, spot, and, rarely, transport, it, to, their, setts, surplus, killing, has, been, observed, in, chicken, coops, badgers, prey, on, rabbits, throughout, the, year, especially, during, times, when, their, young, are, available, they, catch, young, rabbits, by, locating, their, position, in, their, nest, by, scent, then, dig, vertically, downwards, to, them, in, mountainous, or, hilly, districts, where, vegetable, food, is, scarce, badgers, rely, on, rabbits, as, a, principal, food, source, adult, rabbits, are, usually, avoided, unless, they, are,

areas, where, badgers, are, common, hedgehogs, are, scarce, some, rogue, badgers, may, kill, lambs, though, this, is, very, rare, they, may, be, erroneously, implicated, in, lamb, killings, through, the, presence, of, discarded, wool, and, bones, near, their, setts, though, foxes, which, occasionally, live, alongside, badgers, are, often, the, culprits, as, badgers, do, not, transport, food, to, their, setts, they, typically, kill, lambs, by, biting, them, behind, the, shoulder, poultry, and, game, birds, are, also, taken, only, rarely, some, badgers, may, build, their, setts, in, close, proximity, to, poultry, or, game, farms, without, ever, causing, damage, in, the, rare, instances, in, which, badgers, do, kill, reared, birds, the, killings, usually, occur, in, february, march, when, food, is, scarce, due, to, harsh, weather, and, increases, in, badger, populations, badgers, can, easily, breach, bee, hives, with, their, jaws, and, are, mostly, indifferent, to, bee, stings, even, when, set, upon, by, swarms, european, badgers, have, few, natural, enemies, while, normally, docile, badgers, can, become, extremely, aggressive, and, ferocious, when, cornered, making, it,

due, to, human, persecution, and, usually, prefer, easier, larger, prey, like, ungulates, while, badgers, may, fight, viciously, if, aware, of, a, predator, and, cornered, without, an, escape, route,

roe, deer, capreolus, capreolus, it, was, detected, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1971, where, it, was, linked, to, an, outbreak, of, bovine, tb, in, cows, the, evidence, appears, to, indicate, that, the, badger, is, the, primary, reservoir, of, infection, for, cattle, in, the, southwest, of, england, wales, and, ireland, since, then, there, has, been, considerable, controversy, as, to, whether, culling, badgers, will, effectively, reduce, or, eliminate, bovine, tb, in, cattle, badgers, are, vulnerable, to, the, mustelid, herpesvirus, 1, as, well, as, rabies, and, canine, distemper, though,

function, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, rates, the, european, badger, as, being, of, least, concern, this, is, because, it, is, a, relatively, common, species, with, a, wide, range, and, populations, are, generally, stable, in, central, europe, it, has, become, more, abundant, in, recent, decades, due, to, a, reduction, in, the, incidence, of, rabies, in, other, areas, it, has, also, fared, well, with, increases, in, numbers, in, western, europe, and, the, united, kingdom, however, in, some, areas, of, intensive, agriculture, it, has, reduced, in, numbers,
