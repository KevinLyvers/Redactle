sauria, macartney, 1802, lizard, is, the, common, name, used, for, all, squamate, reptiles, other, than, snakes, and, to, a, lesser, extent, amphisbaenians, encompassing, over, 7, 000, species, ranging, across, all, continents, except, antarctica, as, well, as, most, oceanic, island, chains, the, grouping, is, paraphyletic, as, some, lizards, are, more, closely, related, to, snakes, than, they, are, to, other, lizards, lizards, range, in, size, from, chameleons, and, geckos, a, few, centimeters, long, to, the, 3, meter, long, komodo, dragon, most, lizards, are, quadrupedal, running, with, a, strong, side, to, side, motion, some, lineages, known, as, legless, lizards, have, secondarily, lost, their, legs, and, have, long, snake, like, bodies, some, lizards, such, as, the, forest, dwelling, draco, are, able, to, glide, they, are, often, territorial, the, males, fighting, off, other, males, and, signalling, often, with, bright, colours, to, attract, mates, and, to, intimidate, rivals, lizards, are, mainly, carnivorous, often, being, sit, and, wait, predators, many, smaller, species, eat, insects, while, the, komodo, eats, mammals, as, big, as, water, buffalo, lizards, make, use, of, a, variety, of, antipredator, adaptations, including, venom, camouflage, reflex, bleeding, and, the, ability, to, sacrifice, and, regrow, their, tails, the, adult, length, of, species, within, the, suborder, ranges, from, a, few, centimeters, for, chameleons, such, as, brookesia, micra, and, geckos, such, as, sphaerodactylus, ariasae, to, nearly, 3, m, 10, ft, in, the, case, of, the, largest, living, varanid, lizard, the, komodo, dragon, most, lizards, are, fairly, small, animals, lizards, typically, have, rounded, torsos, elevated, heads, on, short, necks, four, limbs, and, long, tails, although, some, are, legless, lizards, and, snakes, share, a, movable, quadrate, bone, distinguishing, them, from, the, rhynchocephalians, which, have, more, rigid, diapsid, skulls, some, lizards, such, as, chameleons, have, prehensile, tails, assisting, them, in, climbing, among, vegetation, as, in, other, reptiles, the, skin, of, lizards, is, covered, in, overlapping, scales, made, of, keratin, this, provides, protection, from, the, environment, and, reduces, water, loss, through, evaporation, this, adaptation, enables, lizards, to, thrive, in, some, of, the, driest, deserts, on, earth, the, skin, is, tough, and, leathery, and, is, shed, sloughed, as, the, animal, grows, unlike, snakes, which, shed, the, skin, in, a, single, piece, lizards, slough, their, skin, in, several, pieces, the, scales, may, be, modified, into, spines, for, display, or, protection, and, some, species, have, bone, osteoderms, underneath, the, scales, the, dentitions, of, lizards, reflect, their, wide, range, of, diets, including, carnivorous, insectivorous, omnivorous, herbivorous, nectivorous, and, molluscivorous, species, typically, have, uniform, teeth, suited, to, their, diet, but, several, species, have, variable, teeth, such, as, cutting, teeth, in, the, front, of, the, jaws, and, crushing, teeth, in, the, rear, most, species, are, pleurodont, though, agamids, and, chameleons, are, acrodont, the, tongue, can, be, extended, outside, the, mouth, and, is, often, long, in, the, beaded, lizards, whiptails, and, monitor, lizards, the, tongue, is, forked, and, used, mainly, or, exclusively, to, sense, the, environment, continually, flicking, out, to, sample, the, environment, and, back, to, transfer, molecules, to, the, vomeronasal, organ, responsible, for, chemosensation, analogous, to, but, different, from, smell, or, taste, in, geckos, the, tongue, is, used, to, lick, the, eyes, clean, they, have, no, eyelids, chameleons, have, very, long, sticky, tongues, which, can, be, extended, rapidly, to, catch, their, insect, prey, three, lineages, the, geckos, anoles, and, chameleons, have, modified, the, scales, under, their, toes, to, form, adhesive, pads, highly, prominent, in, the, first, two, groups, the, pads, are, composed, of, millions, of, tiny, setae, hair, like, structures, which, fit, closely, to, the, substrate, to, adhere, using, van, der, waals, forces, no, liquid, adhesive, is, needed, in, addition, the, toes, of, chameleons, are, divided, into, two, opposed, groups, on, each, foot, zygodactyly, enabling, them, to, perch, on, branches, as, birds, do, aside, from, legless, lizards, most, lizards, are, quadrupedal, and, move, using, gaits, with, alternating, movement, of, the, right, and, left, limbs, with, substantial, body, bending, this, body, bending, prevents, significant, respiration, during, movement, limiting, their, endurance, in, a, mechanism, called, carrier, s, constraint, several, species, can, run, bipedally, and, a, few, can, prop, themselves, up, on, their, hindlimbs, and, tail, while, stationary, several, small, species, such, as, those, in, the, genus, draco, can, glide, some, can, attain, a, distance, of, 60, metres, 200, feet, losing, 10, metres, 33, feet, in, height, some, species, like, geckos, and, chameleons, adhere, to, vertical, surfaces, including, glass, and, ceilings, some, species, like, the, common, basilisk, can, run, across, water, lizards, make, use, of, their, senses, of, sight, touch, olfaction, and, hearing, like, other, vertebrates, the, balance, of, these, varies, with, the, habitat, of, different, species, for, instance, skinks, that, live, largely, covered, by, loose, soil, rely, heavily, on, olfaction, and, touch, while, geckos, depend, largely, on, acute, vision, for, their, ability, to, hunt, and, to, evaluate, the, distance, to, their, prey, before, striking, monitor, lizards, have, acute, vision, hearing, and, olfactory, senses, some, lizards, make, unusual, use, of, their, sense, organs, chameleons, can, steer, their, eyes, in, different, directions, sometimes, providing, non, overlapping, fields, of, view, such, as, forwards, and, backwards, at, once, lizards, lack, external, ears, having, instead, a, circular, opening, in, which, the, tympanic, membrane, eardrum, can, be, seen, many, species, rely, on, hearing, for, early, warning, of, predators, and, flee, at, the, slightest, sound, as, in, snakes, and, many, mammals, all, lizards, have, a, specialised, olfactory, system, the, vomeronasal, organ, used, to, detect, pheromones, monitor, lizards, transfer, scent, from, the, tip, of, their, tongue, to, the, organ, the, tongue, is, used, only, for, this, information, gathering, purpose, and, is, not, involved, in, manipulating, food, some, lizards, particularly, iguanas, have, retained, a, photosensory, organ, on, the, top, of, their, heads, called, the, parietal, eye, a, basal, primitive, feature, also, present, in, the, tuatara, this, eye, has, only, a, rudimentary, retina, and, lens, and, cannot, form, images, but, is, sensitive, to, changes, in, light, and, dark, and, can, detect, movement, this, helps, them, detect, predators, stalking, it, from, above, until, 2006, it, was, thought, that, the, gila, monster, and, the, mexican, beaded, lizard, were, the, only, venomous, lizards, however, several, species, of, monitor, lizards, including, the, komodo, dragon, produce, powerful, venom, in, their, oral, glands, lace, monitor, venom, for, instance, causes, swift, loss, of, consciousness, and, extensive, bleeding, through, its, pharmacological, effects, both, lowering, blood, pressure, and, preventing, blood, clotting, nine, classes, of, toxin, known, from, snakes, are, produced, by, lizards, the, range, of, actions, provides, the, potential, for, new, medicinal, drugs, based, on, lizard, venom, proteins, genes, associated, with, venom, toxins, have, been, found, in, the, salivary, glands, of, a, wide, range, of, lizards, including, species, traditionally, thought, of, as, non, venomous, such, as, iguanas, and, bearded, dragons, this, suggests, that, these, genes, evolved, in, the, common, ancestor, of, lizards, and, snakes, some, 200, million, years, ago, forming, a, single, clade, the, toxicofera, however, most, of, these, putative, venom, genes, were, housekeeping, genes, found, in, all, cells, and, tissues, including, skin, and, cloacal, scent, glands, the, genes, in, question, may, thus, be, evolutionary, precursors, of, venom, genes, recent, studies, 2013, and, 2014, on, the, lung, anatomy, of, the, savannah, monitor, and, green, iguana, found, them, to, have, a, unidirectional, airflow, system, which, involves, the, air, moving, in, a, loop, through, the, lungs, when, breathing, this, was, previously, thought, to, only, exist, in, the, archosaurs, crocodilians, and, birds, this, may, be, evidence, that, unidirectional, airflow, is, an, ancestral, trait, in, diapsids, as, with, all, amniotes, lizards, rely, on, internal, fertilisation, and, copulation, involves, the, male, inserting, one, of, his, hemipenes, into, the, female, s, cloaca, female, lizards, also, have, hemiclitorises, a, doubled, clitoris, the, majority, of, species, are, oviparous, egg, laying, the, female, deposits, the, eggs, in, a, protective, structure, like, a, nest, or, crevice, or, simply, on, the, ground, depending, on, the, species, clutch, size, can, vary, from, 4, 5, percent, of, the, females, body, weight, to, 40, 50, percent, and, clutches, range, from, one, or, a, few, large, eggs, to, dozens, of, small, ones, in, most, lizards, the, eggs, have, leathery, shells, to, allow, for, the, exchange, of, water, although, more, arid, living, species, have, calcified, shells, to, retain, water, inside, the, eggs, the, embryos, use, nutrients, from, the, yolk, parental, care, is, uncommon, and, the, female, usually, abandons, the, eggs, after, laying, them, brooding, and, protection, of, eggs, do, occur, in, some, species, the, female, prairie, skink, uses, respiratory, water, loss, to, maintain, the, humidity, of, the, eggs, which, facilitates, embryonic, development, in, lace, monitors, the, young, hatch, close, to, 300, days, and, the, female, returns, to, help, them, escape, the, termite, mound, where, the, eggs, were, laid, around, 20, percent, of, lizard, species, reproduce, via, viviparity, live, birth, this, is, particularly, common, in, anguimorphs, viviparous, species, give, birth, to, relatively, developed, young, which, look, like, miniature, adults, embryos, are, nourished, via, a, placenta, like, structure, a, minority, of, lizards, have, parthenogenesis, reproduction, from, unfertilised, eggs, these, species, consist, of, all, females, who, reproduce, asexually, with, no, need, for, males, this, is, known, to, occur, in, various, species, of, whiptail, lizards, parthenogenesis, was, also, recorded, in, species, that, normally, reproduce, sexually, a, captive, female, komodo, dragon, produced, a, clutch, of, eggs, despite, being, separated, from, males, for, over, two, years, sex, determination, in, lizards, can, be, temperature, dependent, the, temperature, of, the, eggs, micro, environment, can, determine, the, sex, of, the, hatched, young, low, temperature, incubation, produces, more, females, while, higher, temperatures, produce, more, males, however, some, lizards, have, sex, chromosomes, and, both, male, heterogamety, xy, and, xxy, and, female, heterogamety, zw, occur, a, significant, component, of, aging, in, the, painted, dragon, lizard, ctenophorus, pictus, is, fading, breeding, colors, by, manipulating, superoxide, levels, using, a, superoxide, dismutase, mimetic, it, was, shown, that, this, fading, coloration, is, likely, due, to, gradual, loss, with, lizard, age, of, an, innate, capacity, for, antioxidation, due, to, increasing, dna, damage, the, majority, of, lizard, species, are, active, during, the, day, though, some, are, active, at, night, notably, geckos, as, ectotherms, lizards, have, a, limited, ability, to, regulate, their, body, temperature, and, must, seek, out, and, bask, in, sunlight, to, gain, enough, heat, to, become, fully, active, thermoregulation, behavior, can, be, beneficial, in, the, short, term, for, lizards, as, it, allows, the, ability, to, buffer, environmental, variation, and, endure, climate, warming, in, high, altitudes, the, podarcis, hispaniscus, responds, to, higher, temperature, with, a, darker, dorsal, coloration, to, prevent, uv, radiation, and, background, matching, their, thermoregulatory, mechanisms, also, allow, the, lizard, to, maintain, their, ideal, body, temperature, for, optimal, mobility, most, social, interactions, among, lizards, are, between, breeding, individuals, territoriality, is, common, and, is, correlated, with, species, that, use, sit, and, wait, hunting, strategies, males, establish, and, maintain, territories, that, contain, resources, that, attract, females, and, which, they, defend, from, other, males, important, resources, include, basking, feeding, and, nesting, sites, as, well, as, refuges, from, predators, the, habitat, of, a, species, affects, the, structure, of, territories, for, example, rock, lizards, have, territories, atop, rocky, outcrops, some, species, may, aggregate, in, groups, enhancing, vigilance, and, lessening, the, risk, of, predation, for, individuals, particularly, for, juveniles, agonistic, behaviour, typically, occurs, between, sexually, mature, males, over, territory, or, mates, and, may, involve, displays, posturing, chasing, grappling, and, biting, lizards, signal, both, to, attract, mates, and, to, intimidate, rivals, visual, displays, include, body, postures, and, inflation, push, ups, bright, colours, mouth, gapings, and, tail, waggings, male, anoles, and, iguanas, have, dewlaps, or, skin, flaps, which, come, in, various, sizes, colours, and, patterns, and, the, expansion, of, the, dewlap, as, well, as, head, bobs, and, body, movements, add, to, the, visual, signals, some, species, have, deep, blue, dewlaps, and, communicate, with, ultraviolet, signals, blue, tongued, skinks, will, flash, their, tongues, as, a, threat, display, chameleons, are, known, to, change, their, complex, colour, patterns, when, communicating, particularly, during, agonistic, encounters, they, tend, to, show, brighter, colours, when, displaying, aggression, and, darker, colours, when, they, submit, or, give, up, several, gecko, species, are, brightly, coloured, some, species, tilt, their, bodies, to, display, their, coloration, in, certain, species, brightly, coloured, males, turn, dull, when, not, in, the, presence, of, rivals, or, females, while, it, is, usually, males, that, display, in, some, species, females, also, use, such, communication, in, the, bronze, anole, head, bobs, are, a, common, form, of, communication, among, females, the, speed, and, frequency, varying, with, age, and, territorial, status, chemical, cues, or, pheromones, are, also, important, in, communication, males, typically, direct, signals, at, rivals, while, females, direct, them, at, potential, mates, lizards, may, be, able, to, recognise, individuals, of, the, same, species, by, their, scent, acoustic, communication, is, less, common, in, lizards, hissing, a, typical, reptilian, sound, is, mostly, produced, by, larger, species, as, part, of, a, threat, display, accompanying, gaping, jaws, some, groups, particularly, geckos, snake, lizards, and, some, iguanids, can, produce, more, complex, sounds, and, vocal, apparatuses, have, independently, evolved, in, different, groups, these, sounds, are, used, for, courtship, territorial, defense, and, in, distress, and, include, clicks, squeaks, barks, and, growls, the, mating, call, of, the, male, tokay, gecko, is, heard, as, tokay, tokay, tactile, communication, involves, individuals, rubbing, against, each, other, either, in, courtship, or, in, aggression, some, chameleon, species, communicate, with, one, another, by, vibrating, the, substrate, that, they, are, standing, on, such, as, a, tree, branch, or, leaf, lizards, are, found, worldwide, excluding, the, far, north, and, antarctica, and, some, islands, they, can, be, found, in, elevations, from, sea, level, to, 5, 000, m, 16, 000, ft, they, prefer, warmer, tropical, climates, but, are, adaptable, and, can, live, in, all, but, the, most, extreme, environments, lizards, also, exploit, a, number, of, habitats, most, primarily, live, on, the, ground, but, others, may, live, in, rocks, on, trees, underground, and, even, in, water, the, marine, iguana, is, adapted, for, life, in, the, sea, the, majority, of, lizard, species, are, predatory, and, the, most, common, prey, items, are, small, terrestrial, invertebrates, particularly, insects, many, species, are, sit, and, wait, predators, though, others, may, be, more, active, foragers, chameleons, prey, on, numerous, insect, species, such, as, beetles, grasshoppers, and, winged, termites, as, well, as, spiders, they, rely, on, persistence, and, ambush, to, capture, these, prey, an, individual, perches, on, a, branch, and, stays, perfectly, still, with, only, its, eyes, moving, when, an, insect, lands, the, chameleon, focuses, its, eyes, on, the, target, and, slowly, moves, toward, it, before, projecting, its, long, sticky, tongue, which, when, hauled, back, brings, the, attached, prey, with, it, geckos, feed, on, crickets, beetles, termites, and, moths, termites, are, an, important, part, of, the, diets, of, some, species, of, autarchoglossa, since, as, social, insects, they, can, be, found, in, large, numbers, in, one, spot, ants, may, form, a, prominent, part, of, the, diet, of, some, lizards, particularly, among, the, lacertas, horned, lizards, are, also, well, known, for, specializing, on, ants, due, to, their, small, size, and, indigestible, chitin, ants, must, be, consumed, in, large, amounts, and, ant, eating, lizards, have, larger, stomachs, than, even, herbivorous, ones, species, of, skink, and, alligator, lizards, eat, snails, and, their, power, jaws, and, molar, like, teeth, are, adapted, for, breaking, the, shells, larger, species, such, as, monitor, lizards, can, feed, on, larger, prey, including, fish, frogs, birds, mammals, and, other, reptiles, prey, may, be, swallowed, whole, and, torn, into, smaller, pieces, both, bird, and, reptile, eggs, may, also, be, consumed, as, well, gila, monsters, and, beaded, lizards, climb, trees, to, reach, both, the, eggs, and, young, of, birds, despite, being, venomous, these, species, rely, on, their, strong, jaws, to, kill, prey, mammalian, prey, typically, consists, of, rodents, and, leporids, the, komodo, dragon, can, kill, prey, as, large, as, water, buffalo, dragons, are, prolific, scavengers, and, a, single, decaying, carcass, can, attract, several, from, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, away, a, 50, kg, 110, lb, dragon, is, capable, of, consuming, a, 31, kg, 68, lb, carcass, in, 17, minutes, around, 2, percent, of, lizard, species, including, many, iguanids, are, herbivores, adults, of, these, species, eat, plant, parts, like, flowers, leaves, stems, and, fruit, while, juveniles, eat, more, insects, plant, parts, can, be, hard, to, digest, and, as, they, get, closer, to, adulthood, juvenile, iguanas, eat, faeces, from, adults, to, acquire, the, microflora, necessary, for, their, transition, to, a, plant, based, diet, perhaps, the, most, herbivorous, species, is, the, marine, iguana, which, dives, 15, m, 49, ft, to, forage, for, algae, kelp, and, other, marine, plants, some, non, herbivorous, species, supplement, their, insect, diet, with, fruit, which, is, easily, digested, lizards, have, a, variety, of, antipredator, adaptations, including, running, and, climbing, venom, camouflage, tail, autotomy, and, reflex, bleeding, lizards, exploit, a, variety, of, different, camouflage, methods, many, lizards, are, disruptively, patterned, in, some, species, such, as, aegean, wall, lizards, individuals, vary, in, colour, and, select, rocks, which, best, match, their, own, colour, to, minimise, the, risk, of, being, detected, by, predators, the, moorish, gecko, is, able, to, change, colour, for, camouflage, when, a, light, coloured, gecko, is, placed, on, a, dark, surface, it, darkens, within, an, hour, to, match, the, environment, the, chameleons, in, general, use, their, ability, to, change, their, coloration, for, signalling, rather, than, camouflage, but, some, species, such, as, smith, s, dwarf, chameleon, do, use, active, colour, change, for, camouflage, purposes, the, flat, tail, horned, lizard, s, body, is, coloured, like, its, desert, background, and, is, flattened, and, fringed, with, white, scales, to, minimise, its, shadow, many, lizards, including, geckos, and, skinks, are, capable, of, shedding, their, tails, autotomy, the, detached, tail, sometimes, brilliantly, coloured, continues, to, writhe, after, detaching, distracting, the, predator, s, attention, from, the, fleeing, prey, lizards, partially, regenerate, their, tails, over, a, period, of, weeks, some, 326, genes, are, involved, in, regenerating, lizard, tails, the, fish, scale, gecko, geckolepis, megalepis, sheds, patches, of, skin, and, scales, if, grabbed, many, lizards, attempt, to, escape, from, danger, by, running, to, a, place, of, safety, for, example, wall, lizards, can, run, up, walls, and, hide, in, holes, or, cracks, horned, lizards, adopt, differing, defences, for, specific, predators, they, may, play, dead, to, deceive, a, predator, that, has, caught, them, attempt, to, outrun, the, rattlesnake, which, does, not, pursue, prey, but, stay, still, relying, on, their, cryptic, coloration, for, masticophis, whip, snakes, which, can, catch, even, swift, prey, if, caught, some, species, such, as, the, greater, short, horned, lizard, puff, themselves, up, making, their, bodies, hard, for, a, narrow, mouthed, predator, like, a, whip, snake, to, swallow, finally, horned, lizards, can, squirt, blood, at, cat, and, dog, predators, from, a, pouch, beneath, its, eyes, to, a, distance, of, about, two, metres, 6, 6, feet, the, blood, tastes, foul, to, these, attackers, the, closest, living, relatives, of, lizards, are, rhynchocephalians, a, once, diverse, order, of, reptiles, of, which, is, there, is, now, only, one, living, species, the, tuatara, of, new, zealand, some, reptiles, from, the, early, and, middle, triassic, like, sophineta, and, megachirella, are, suggested, to, be, stem, group, squamates, more, closely, related, to, modern, lizards, than, rhynchocephalians, however, their, position, is, disputed, with, some, studies, recovering, them, as, less, closely, related, to, squamates, than, rhynchocephalians, are, the, oldest, undisputed, lizards, date, to, the, middle, jurassic, from, remains, found, in, europe, asia, and, north, africa, lizard, morphological, and, ecological, diversity, substantially, increased, over, the, course, of, the, cretaceous, mosasaurs, likely, evolved, from, an, extinct, group, of, aquatic, lizards, known, as, aigialosaurs, in, the, early, cretaceous, dolichosauridae, is, a, family, of, late, cretaceous, aquatic, varanoid, lizards, closely, related, to, the, mosasaurs, the, position, of, the, lizards, and, other, squamata, among, the, reptiles, was, studied, using, fossil, evidence, by, rainer, schoch, and, hans, dieter, sues, in, 2015, lizards, form, about, 60, of, the, extant, non, avian, reptiles, archosauromorpha, pantestudines, kuehneosauridae, rhynchocephalia, squamata, both, the, snakes, and, the, amphisbaenia, worm, lizards, are, clades, deep, within, the, squamata, the, smallest, clade, that, contains, all, the, lizards, so, lizard, is, paraphyletic, the, cladogram, is, based, on, genomic, analysis, by, wiens, and, colleagues, in, 2012, and, 2016, excluded, taxa, are, shown, in, upper, case, on, the, cladogram, dibamidae, diplodactylidae,

considered, to, be, lizards, in, the, 13th, century, lizards, were, recognized, in, europe, as, part, of, a, broad, category, of, reptiles, that, consisted, of, a, miscellany, of, egg, laying, creatures, including, snakes, various, fantastic, monsters, assorted, amphibians, and, worms, as, recorded, by, vincent, of, beauvais, in, his, mirror, of, nature, the, seventeenth, century, saw, changes, in, this, loose, description, the, name, sauria, was, coined, by, james, macartney, 1802, it, was, the, latinisation, of, the, french, name, sauriens, coined, by, alexandre, brongniart, 1800, for, an, order, of, reptiles, in, the, classification, proposed, by, the, author, containing, lizards, and, crocodilians, later, discovered, not, to, be, each, other, s, closest, relatives, later, authors, used, the, term, sauria, in, a, more, restricted, sense, i, e, as, a, synonym, of, lacertilia, a, suborder, of, squamata, that, includes, all, lizards, but, excludes, snakes, this, classification, is, rarely, used, today, because, sauria, so, defined, is, a, paraphyletic, group, it, was, defined, as, a, clade, by, jacques, gauthier, arnold, g, kluge, and, timothy, rowe, 1988, as, the, group, containing, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, archosaurs, and, lepidosaurs, the, groups, containing, crocodiles, and, lizards, as, per, mcartney, s, original, definition, and, all, its, descendants, a, different, definition, was, formulated, by, michael, debraga, and, olivier, rieppel, 1997, who, defined, sauria, as, the, clade, containing, the, most, recent, common,
