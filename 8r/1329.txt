a, biopsy, is, a, medical, test, commonly, performed, by, a, surgeon, an, interventional, radiologist, or, an, interventional, cardiologist, the, process, involves, the, extraction, of, sample, cells, or, tissues, for, examination, to, determine, the, presence, or, extent, of, a, disease, the, tissue, is, then, fixed, dehydrated, embedded, sectioned, stained, and, mounted, before, it, is, generally, examined, under, a, microscope, by, a, pathologist, it, may, also, be, analyzed, chemically, when, an, entire, lump, or, suspicious, area, is, removed, the, procedure, is, called, an, excisional, biopsy, an, incisional, biopsy, or, core, biopsy, samples, a, portion, of, the, abnormal, tissue, without, attempting, to, remove, the, entire, lesion, or, tumor, when, a, sample, of, tissue, or, fluid, is, removed, with, a, needle, in, such, a, way, that, cells, are, removed, without, preserving, the, histological, architecture, of, the, tissue, cells, the, procedure, is, called, a, needle, aspiration, biopsy, biopsies, are, most, commonly, performed, for, insight, into, possible, cancerous, or, inflammatory, conditions, the, arab, physician, abulcasis, 1013, 1107, developed, one, of, the, earliest, diagnostic, biopsies, he, used, a, needle, to, puncture, a, goiter, and, then, characterized, the, material, the, term, biopsy, reflects, the, greek, words, bios, life, and, opsis, a, sight, the, french, dermatologist, ernest, besnier, introduced, the, word, biopsie, to, the, medical, community, in, 1879, when, cancer, is, suspected, a, variety, of, biopsy, techniques, can, be, applied, an, excisional, biopsy, is, an, attempt, to, remove, an, entire, lesion, when, the, specimen, is, evaluated, in, addition, to, diagnosis, the, amount, of, uninvolved, tissue, around, the, lesion, the, surgical, margin, of, the, specimen, is, examined, to, see, if, the, disease, has, spread, beyond, the, area, biopsied, clear, margins, or, negative, margins, means, that, no, disease, was, found, at, the, edges, of, the, biopsy, specimen, positive, margins, means, that, disease, was, found, and, a, wider, excision, may, be, needed, depending, on, the, diagnosis, when, intact, removal, is, not, indicated, for, a, variety, of, reasons, a, wedge, of, tissue, may, be, taken, in, an, incisional, biopsy, in, some, cases, a, sample, can, be, collected, by, devices, that, bite, a, sample, a, variety, of, sizes, of, needles, can, collect, tissue, in, the, lumen, core, biopsy, smaller, diameter, needles, collect, cells, and, cell, clusters, fine, needle, aspiration, biopsy, pathologic, examination, of, a, biopsy, can, determine, whether, a, lesion, is, benign, or, malignant, and, can, help, differentiate, between, different, types, of, cancer, in, contrast, to, a, biopsy, that, merely, samples, a, lesion, a, larger, excisional, specimen, called, a, resection, may, come, to, a, pathologist, typically, from, a, surgeon, attempting, to, eradicate, a, known, lesion, from, a, patient, for, example, a, pathologist, would, examine, a, mastectomy, specimen, even, if, a, previous, nonexcisional, breast, biopsy, had, already, established, the, diagnosis, of, breast, cancer, examination, of, the, full, mastectomy, specimen, would, confirm, the, exact, nature, of, the, cancer, subclassification, of, tumor, and, histologic, grading, and, reveal, the, extent, of, its, spread, pathologic, staging, there, are, two, types, of, liquid, biopsy, which, is, not, really, a, biopsy, as, they, are, blood, tests, that, do, not, require, a, biopsy, of, tissue, circulating, tumor, cell, assays, or, cell, free, circulating, tumor, dna, tests, these, methods, provide, a, non, invasive, alternative, to, repeat, invasive, biopsies, to, monitor, cancer, treatment, test, available, drugs, against, the, circulating, tumor, cells, evaluate, the, mutations, in, cancer, and, plan, individualized, treatments, in, addition, because, cancer, is, a, heterogeneous, genetic, disease, and, excisional, biopsies, provide, only, a, snapshot, in, time, of, some, of, the, rapid, dynamic, genetic, changes, occurring, in, tumors, liquid, biopsies, provide, some, advantages, over, tissue, biopsy, based, genomic, testing, in, addition, excisional, biopsies, are, invasive, cannot, be, used, repeatedly, and, are, ineffective, in, understanding, the, dynamics, of, tumor, progression, and, metastasis, by, detecting, quantifying, and, characterisation, vital, circulating, tumor, cells, or, genomic, alterations, in, ctcs, and, cell, free, dna, in, blood, liquid, biopsy, can, provide, real, time, information, on, the, stage, of, tumor, progression, treatment, effectiveness, and, cancer, metastasis, risk, this, technological, development, could, make, it, possible, to, diagnose, and, manage, cancer, from, repeated, blood, tests, rather, than, from, a, traditional, biopsy, circulating, tumor, cell, tests, are, already, available, but, not, covered, by, insurance, yet, at, maintrac, and, under, development, by, many, pharmaceutical, companies, those, tests, analyze, circulating, tumor, cells, ctcs, analysis, of, individual, ctcs, demonstrated, a, high, level, of, heterogeneity, seen, at, the, single, cell, level, for, both, protein, expression, and, protein, localization, and, the, ctcs, reflected, both, the, primary, biopsy, and, the, changes, seen, in, the, metastatic, sites, analysis, of, cell, free, circulating, tumor, dna, cfdna, has, an, advantage, over, circulating, tumor, cells, assays, in, that, there, is, approximately, 100, times, more, cell, free, dna, than, there, is, dna, in, circulating, tumor, cells, these, tests, analyze, fragments, of, tumor, cell, dna, that, are, continuously, shed, by, tumors, into, the, bloodstream, companies, offering, cfdna, next, generation, sequencing, testing, include, personal, genome, diagnostics, and, guardant, health, these, tests, are, moving, into, widespread, use, when, a, tissue, biopsy, has, insufficient, material, for, dna, testing, or, when, it, is, not, safe, to, do, an, invasive, biopsy, procedure, according, to, a, recent, report, of, results, on, over, 15, 000, advanced, cancer, patients, sequenced, with, the, guardant, health, test, a, 2014, study, of, the, blood, of, 846, patients, with, 15, different, types, of, cancer, in, 24, institutions, was, able, to, detect, the, presence, of, cancer, dna, in, the, body, they, found, tumor, dna, in, the, blood, of, more, than, 80, percent, of, patients, with, metastatic, cancers, and, about, 47, percent, of, those, with, localized, tumors, the, test, does, not, indicate, the, tumor, site, s, or, other, information, about, the, tumor, the, test, did, not, produce, false, positives, such, tests, may, also, be, useful, to, assess, whether, malignant, cells, remain, in, patients, whose, tumors, have, been, surgically, removed, up, to, 30, percent, are, expected, to, relapse, because, some, tumor, cells, remain, initial, studies, identified, about, half, the, patients, who, later, relapsed, again, without, false, positives, another, potential, use, is, to, track, the, specific, dna, mutations, driving, a, tumor, many, new, cancer, medications, block, specific, molecular, processes, such, tests, could, allow, easier, targeting, of, therapy, to, tumors, for, easily, detected, and, accessed, sites, any, suspicious, lesions, may, be, assessed, originally, this, was, skin, or, superficial, masses, x, ray, then, later, ct, mri, and, ultrasound, along, with, endoscopy, extended, the, range, a, biopsy, of, the, temporal, arteries, is, often, performed, for, suspected, vasculitis, in, inflammatory, bowel, disease, crohn, s, disease, and, ulcerative, colitis, frequent, biopsies, are, taken, to, assess, the, activity, of, the, disease, and, to, assess, changes, that, precede, malignancy, biopsy, specimens, are, often, taken, from, part, of, a, lesion, when, the, cause, of, a, disease, is, uncertain, or, its, extent, or, exact, character, is, in, doubt, vasculitis, for, instance, is, usually, diagnosed, on, biopsy, needle, core, biopsies, or, aspirates, of, the, pancreas, may, be, made, through, the, duodenum, or, stomach, in, the, case, of, wilson, s, disease, clinicians, use, biopsies, to, determine, the, quantitative, copper, level, after, the, biopsy, is, performed, the, sample, of, tissue, that, was, removed, from, the, patient, is, sent, to, the, pathology, laboratory, a, pathologist, specializes, in, diagnosing, diseases, such, as, cancer, by, examining, tissue, under, a, microscope, when, the, laboratory, see, histology, receives, the, biopsy, sample, the, tissue, is, processed, and, an, extremely, thin, slice, of, tissue, is, removed, from, the, sample, and, attached, to, a, glass, slide, any, remaining, tissue, is, saved, for, use, in, later, studies, if, required, the, slide, with, the, tissue, attached, is, treated, with, dyes, that, stain, the, tissue, which, allows, the, individual, cells, in, the, tissue, to, be, seen, more, clearly, the, slide, is, then, given, to, the, pathologist, who, examines, the, tissue, under, a, microscope, looking, for, any, abnormal, findings, the, pathologist, then, prepares, a, report, that, lists, any, abnormal, or, important, findings, from, the, biopsy, this, report, is, sent, to, the, surgeon, who, originally, performed, the, biopsy, on, the, patient
