monocotyledons, m, n, k, t, l, i, d, n, z, commonly, referred, to, as, monocots, lilianae, sensu, chase, reveal, are, grass, and, grass, like, flowering, plants, angiosperms, the, seeds, of, which, typically, contain, only, one, embryonic, leaf, or, cotyledon, they, constitute, one, of, the, major, groups, into, which, the, flowering, plants, have, traditionally, been, divided, the, rest, of, the, flowering, plants, have, two, cotyledons, and, were, classified, as, dicotyledons, or, dicots, monocotyledons, have, almost, always, been, recognized, as, a, group, but, with, various, taxonomic, ranks, and, under, several, different, names, the, apg, iii, system, of, 2009, recognises, a, clade, called, monocots, but, does, not, assign, it, to, a, taxonomic, rank, the, monocotyledons, include, about, 70, 000, species, about, a, quarter, of, all, angiosperms, the, largest, family, in, this, group, and, in, the, flowering, plants, as, a, whole, by, number, of, species, are, the, orchids, family, orchidaceae, with, more, than, 20, 000, species, about, 12, 000, species, belong, to, the, true, grasses, poaceae, which, are, economically, the, most, important, family, of, monocotyledons, often, mistaken, for, grasses, sedges, are, also, monocots, in, agriculture, the, majority, of, the, biomass, produced, comes, from, monocotyledons, these, include, not, only, major, grains, rice, wheat, maize, etc, but, also, forage, grasses, sugar, cane, the, bamboos, and, many, other, common, food, and, decorative, crops, the, monocots, or, monocotyledons, have, as, the, name, implies, a, single, mono, cotyledon, or, embryonic, leaf, in, their, seeds, historically, this, feature, was, used, to, contrast, the, monocots, with, the, dicotyledons, or, dicots, which, typically, have, two, cotyledons, however, modern, research, has, shown, that, the, dicots, are, not, a, natural, group, and, the, term, can, only, be, used, to, indicate, all, angiosperms, that, are, not, monocots, and, is, used, in, that, respect, here, from, a, diagnostic, point, of, view, the, number, of, cotyledons, is, neither, a, particularly, useful, characteristic, as, they, are, only, present, for, a, very, short, period, in, a, plant, s, life, nor, is, it, completely, reliable, the, single, cotyledon, is, only, one, of, a, number, of, modifications, of, the, body, plan, of, the, ancestral, monocotyledons, whose, adaptive, advantages, are, poorly, understood, but, may, have, been, related, to, adaption, to, aquatic, habitats, prior, to, radiation, to, terrestrial, habitats, nevertheless, monocots, are, sufficiently, distinctive, that, there, has, rarely, been, disagreement, as, to, membership, of, this, group, despite, considerable, diversity, in, terms, of, external, morphology, however, morphological, features, that, reliably, characterise, major, clades, are, rare, thus, monocots, are, distinguishable, from, other, angiosperms, both, in, terms, of, their, uniformity, and, diversity, on, the, one, hand, the, organization, of, the, shoots, leaf, structure, and, floral, configuration, are, more, uniform, than, in, the, remaining, angiosperms, yet, within, these, constraints, a, wealth, of, diversity, exists, indicating, a, high, degree, of, evolutionary, success, monocot, diversity, includes, perennial, geophytes, such, as, ornamental, flowers, including, orchids, asparagales, tulips, and, lilies, liliales, rosette, and, succulent, epiphytes, asparagales, mycoheterotrophs, liliales, dioscoreales, pandanales, all, in, the, lilioid, monocots, major, cereal, grains, maize, rice, barley, rye, oats, millet, sorghum, and, wheat, in, the, grass, family, and, forage, grasses, poales, as, well, as, woody, tree, like, palm, trees, arecales, bamboo, reeds, and, bromeliads, poales, bananas, and, ginger, zingiberales, in, the, commelinid, monocots, as, well, as, both, emergent, poales, acorales, and, aroids, as, well, as, floating, or, submerged, aquatic, plants, such, as, seagrass, alismatales, the, most, important, distinction, is, their, growth, pattern, lacking, a, lateral, meristem, cambium, that, allows, for, continual, growth, in, diameter, with, height, secondary, growth, and, therefore, this, characteristic, is, a, basic, limitation, in, shoot, construction, although, largely, herbaceous, some, arboraceous, monocots, reach, great, height, length, and, mass, the, latter, include, agaves, palms, pandans, and, bamboos, this, creates, challenges, in, water, transport, that, monocots, deal, with, in, various, ways, some, such, as, species, of, yucca, develop, anomalous, secondary, growth, while, palm, trees, utilise, an, anomalous, primary, growth, form, described, as, establishment, growth, see, vascular, system, the, axis, undergoes, primary, thickening, that, progresses, from, internode, to, internode, resulting, in, a, typical, inverted, conical, shape, of, the, basal, primary, axis, see, tillich, figure, 1, the, limited, conductivity, also, contributes, to, limited, branching, of, the, stems, despite, these, limitations, a, wide, variety, of, adaptive, growth, forms, has, resulted, tillich, figure, 2, from, epiphytic, orchids, asparagales, and, bromeliads, poales, to, submarine, alismatales, including, the, reduced, lemnoideae, and, mycotrophic, burmanniaceae, dioscreales, and, triuridaceae, pandanales, other, forms, of, adaptation, include, the, climbing, vines, of, araceae, alismatales, which, use, negative, phototropism, skototropism, to, locate, host, trees, i, e, the, darkest, area, while, some, palms, such, as, calamus, manan, arecales, produce, the, longest, shoots, in, the, plant, kingdom, up, to, 185, m, long, other, monocots, particularly, poales, have, adopted, a, therophyte, life, form, the, cotyledon, the, primordial, angiosperm, leaf, consists, of, a, proximal, leaf, base, or, hypophyll, and, a, distal, hyperphyll, in, monocots, the, hypophyll, tends, to, be, the, dominant, part, in, contrast, to, other, angiosperms, from, these, considerable, diversity, arises, mature, monocot, leaves, are, generally, narrow, and, linear, forming, a, sheathing, around, the, stem, at, its, base, although, there, are, many, exceptions, leaf, venation, is, of, the, striate, type, mainly, arcuate, striate, or, longitudinally, striate, parallel, less, often, palmate, striate, or, pinnate, striate, with, the, leaf, veins, emerging, at, the, leaf, base, and, then, running, together, at, the, apices, there, is, usually, only, one, leaf, per, node, because, the, leaf, base, encompasses, more, than, half, the, circumference, the, evolution, of, this, monocot, characteristic, has, been, attributed, to, developmental, differences, in, early, zonal, differentiation, rather, than, meristem, activity, leaf, base, theory, the, lack, of, cambium, in, the, primary, root, limits, its, ability, to, grow, sufficiently, to, maintain, the, plant, this, necessitates, early, development, of, roots, derived, from, the, shoot, adventitious, roots, in, addition, to, roots, monocots, develop, runners, and, rhizomes, which, are, creeping, shoots, runners, serve, vegetative, propagation, have, elongated, internodes, run, on, or, just, below, the, surface, of, the, soil, and, in, most, case, bear, scale, leaves, rhizomes, frequently, have, an, additional, storage, function, and, rhizome, producing, plants, are, considered, geophytes, tillich, figure, 11, other, geophytes, develop, bulbs, a, short, axial, body, bearing, leaves, whose, bases,

forms, may, occur, such, as, in, crocosmia, asparagales, some, monocots, may, also, produce, shoots, that, grow, directly, down, into, the, soil, these, are, geophilous, shoots, tillich, figure, 11, that, help, overcome, the, limited, trunk, stability, of, large, woody, monocots, in, nearly, all, cases, the, perigone, consists, of, two, alternating, trimerous, whorls, of, tepals, being, homochlamydeous, without, differentiation, between, calyx, and, corolla, in, zoophilous, pollinated, by, animals, taxa, both, whorls, are, corolline, petal, like, anthesis, the, period, of, flower, opening, is, usually, fugacious, short, lived, some, of, the, more, persistent, perigones, demonstrate, thermonastic, opening, and, closing, responsive, to, changes, in, temperature, about, two, thirds, of, monocots, are, zoophilous, predominantly, by, insects, these, plants, need, to, advertise, to, pollinators, and, do, so, by, way, of, phaneranthous, showy, flowers, such, optical, signalling, is, usually, a, function, of, the, tepal, whorls, but, may, also, be, provided, by, semaphylls, other, structures, such, as, filaments, staminodes, or, stylodia, which, have, become, modified, to, attract, pollinators, however, some, monocot, plants, may, have, aphananthous, inconspicuous, flowers, and, still, be, pollinated, by, animals, in, these, the, plants, rely, either, on, chemical, attraction, or, other, structures, such, as, coloured, bracts, fulfill, the, role, of, optical, attraction, in, some, phaneranthous, plants, such, structures, may, reinforce, floral, structures, the, production, of, fragrances, for, olfactory, signalling, are, common, in, monocots, the, perigone, also, functions, as, a, landing, platform, for, pollinating, insects, the, embryo, consists, of, a, single, cotyledon, usually, with, two, vascular, bundles, the, traditionally, listed, differences, between, monocots, and, dicots, are, as, follows, this, is, a, broad, sketch, only, not, invariably, applicable, as, there, are, a, number, of, exceptions, the, differences, indicated, are, more, true, for, monocots, versus, eudicots, a, number, of, these, differences, are, not, unique, to, the, monocots, and, while, still, useful, no, one, single, feature, will, infallibly, identify, a, plant, as, a, monocot, for, example, trimerous, flowers, and, monosulcate, pollen, are, also, found, in, magnoliids, and, exclusively, adventitious, roots, are, found, in, some, of, the, piperaceae, similarly, at, least, one, of, these, traits, parallel, leaf, veins, is, far, from, universal, among, the, monocots, broad, leaves, and, reticulate, leaf, veins, features, typical, of, dicots, are, found, in, a, wide, variety, of, monocot, families, for, example, trillium, smilax, greenbriar, pogonia, an, orchid, and, the, dioscoreales, yams, potamogeton, and, paris, quadrifolia, herb, paris, are, examples, of, monocots, with, tetramerous, flowers, other, plants, exhibit, a, mixture, of, characteristics, nymphaeaceae, water, lilies, have, reticulate, veins, a, single, cotyledon, adventitious, roots, and, a, monocot, like, vascular, bundle, these, examples, reflect, their, shared, ancestry, nevertheless, this, list, of, traits, is, generally, valid, especially, when, contrasting, monocots, with, eudicots, rather, than, non, monocot, flowering, plants, in, general, monocot, apomorphies, characteristics, derived, during, radiation, rather, than, inherited, from, an, ancestral, form, include, herbaceous, habit, leaves, with, parallel, venation, and, sheathed, base, an, embryo, with, a, single, cotyledon, an, atactostele, numerous, adventitious, roots, sympodial, growth, and, trimerous, 3, parts, per, whorl, flowers, that, are, pentacyclic, 5, whorled, with, 3, sepals, 3, petals, 2, whorls, of, 3, stamens, each, and, 3, carpels, in, contrast, monosulcate, pollen, is, considered, an, ancestral, trait, probably, plesiomorphic, the, distinctive, features, of, the, monocots, have, contributed, to, the, relative, taxonomic, stability, of, the, group, douglas, e, soltis, and, others, identify, thirteen, synapomorphies, shared, characteristics, that, unite, monophyletic, groups, of, taxa, monocots, have, a, distinctive, arrangement, of, vascular, tissue, known, as, an, atactostele, in, which, the, vascular, tissue, is, scattered, rather, than, arranged, in, concentric, rings, collenchyma, is, absent, in, monocot, stems, roots, and, leaves, many, monocots, are, herbaceous, and, do, not, have, the, ability, to, increase, the, width, of, a, stem, secondary, growth, via, the, same, kind, of, vascular, cambium, found, in, non, monocot, woody, plants, however, some, monocots, do, have, secondary, growth, because, this, does, not, arise, from, a, single, vascular, cambium, producing, xylem, inwards, and, phloem, outwards, it, is, termed, anomalous, secondary, growth, examples, of, large, monocots, which, either, exhibit, secondary, growth, or, can, reach, large, sizes, without, it, are, palms, arecaceae, screwpines, pandanaceae, bananas, musaceae, yucca, aloe, dracaena, and, cordyline, the, monocots, form, one, of, five, major, lineages, of, mesangiosperms, core, angiosperms, which, in, themselves, form, 99, 95, of, all, angiosperms, the, monocots, and, the, eudicots, are, the, largest, and, most, diversified, angiosperm, radiations, accounting, for, 22, 8, and, 74, 2, of, all, angiosperm, species, respectively, of, these, the, grass, family, poaceae, is, the, most, economically, important, which, together, with, the, orchids, orchidaceae, account, for, half, of, the, species, diversity, accounting, for, 34, and, 17, of, all, monocots, respectively, and, are, among, the, largest, families, of, angiosperms, they, are, also, among, the, dominant, members, of, many, plant, communities, the, monocots, are, one, of, the, major, divisions, of, the, flowering, plants, or, angiosperms, they, have, been, recognized, as, a, natural, group, since, the, sixteenth, century, when, lobelius, 1571, searching, for, a, characteristic, to, group, plants, by, decided, on, leaf, form, and, their, venation, he, observed, that, the, majority, had, broad, leaves, with, net, like, venation, but, a, smaller, group, were, grass, like, plants, with, long, straight, parallel, veins, in, doing, so, he, distinguished, between, the, dicotyledons, and, the, latter, grass, like, monocotyledon, group, although, he, had, no, formal, names, for, the, two, groups, formal, description, dates, from, john, ray, s, studies, of, seed, structure, in, the, 17th, century, ray, who, is, often, considered, the, first, botanical, systematist, observed, the, dichotomy, of, cotyledon, structure, in, his, examination, of, seeds, he, reported, his, findings, in, a, paper, read, to, the, royal, society, on, 17, december, 1674, entitled, a, discourse, on, the, seeds, of, plants, the, greatest, number, of, plants, that, come, of, seed, spring, at, first, out, of, the, earth, with, two, leaves, which, being, for, the, most, part, of, a, different, figure, from, the, succeeding, leaves, are, by, our, gardeners, not, improperly, called, the, seed, leaves, in, the, first, kind, the, seed, leaves, are, nothing, but, the, two, lobes, of, the, seed, having, their, plain, sides, clapt, together, like, the, two, halves, of, a, walnut, and, therefore, are, of, the, just, figure, of, the, seed, slit, in, sunder, flat, wise, of, seeds, that, spring, out, of, the, earth, with, leaves, like, the, succeeding, and, no, seed, leaves, i, have, observed, two, sorts, 1, such, as, are, congenerous, to, the, first, kind, precedent, that, is, whose, pulp, is, divided, into, two, lobes, and, a, radicle, 2, such, which, neither, spring, out, of, the, ground, with, seed, leaves, nor, have, their, pulp, divided, into, lobes, john, ray, 1674, pp, 164, 166, since, this, paper, appeared, a, year, before, the, publication, of, malpighi, s, anatome, plantarum, 1675, 1679, ray, has, the, priority, at, the, time, ray, did, not, fully, realise, the, importance, of, his, discovery, but, progressively, developed, this, over, successive, publications, and, since, these, were, in, latin, seed, leaves, became, folia, seminalia, and, then, cotyledon, following, malpighi, malpighi, and, ray, were, familiar, with, each, other, s, work, and, malpighi, in, describing, the, same, structures, had, introduced, the, term, cotyledon, which, ray, adopted, in, his, subsequent, writing, mense, quoque, maii, alias, seminales, plantulas, fabarum, phaseolorum, ablatis, pariter, binis, seminalibus, foliis, seu, cotyledonibus, incubandas, posui, in, the, month, of, may, also, i, incubated, two, seed, plants, faba, and, phaseolus, after, removing, the, two, seed, leaves, or, cotyledons, marcello, malpighi, 1679, p, 18, in, this, experiment, malpighi, also, showed, that, the, cotyledons, were, critical, to, the, development, of, the, plant, proof, that, ray, required, for, his, theory, in, his, methodus, plantarum, nova, ray, also, developed, and, justified, the, natural, or, pre, evolutionary, approach, to, classification, based, on, characteristics, selected, a, posteriori, in, order, to, group, together, taxa, that, have, the, greatest, number, of, shared, characteristics, this, approach, also, referred, to, as, polythetic, would, last, till, evolutionary, theory, enabled, eichler, to, develop, the, phyletic, system, that, superseded, it, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, based, on, an, understanding, of, the, acquisition, of, characteristics, he, also, made, the, crucial, observation, ex, hac, seminum, divisione, sumum, potest, generalis, plantarum, distinctio, eaque, meo, judicio, omnium, prima, et, longe, optima, in, eas, sci, quae, plantula, seminali, sunt, bifolia, aut, et, quae, plantula, sem, adulta, analoga, from, this, division, of, the, seeds, derives, a, general, distinction, amongst, plants, that, in, my, judgement, is, first, and, by, far, the, best, into, those, seed, plants, which, are, bifoliate, or, bilobed, and, those, that, are, analogous, to, the, adult, that, is, between, monocots, and, dicots, he, illustrated, this, by, quoting, from, malpighi, and, including, reproductions, of, malpighi, s, drawings, of, cotyledons, see, figure, initially, ray, did, not, develop, a, classification, of, flowering, plants, florifera, based, on, a, division, by, the, number, of, cotyledons, but, developed, his, ideas, over, successive, publications, coining, the, terms, monocotyledones, and, dicotyledones, in, 1703, in, the, revised, version, of, his, methodus, methodus, plantarum, emendata, as, a, primary, method, for, dividing, them, herbae, floriferae, dividi, possunt, ut, diximus, in, monocotyledones, dicotyledones, flowering, plants, can, be, divided, as, we, have, said, into, monocotyledons, dicotyledons, although, linnaeus, 1707, 1778, did, not, utilise, ray, s, discovery, basing, his, own, classification, solely, on, floral, reproductive, morphology, the, term, was, used, shortly, after, his, classification, appeared, 1753, by, scopoli, and, who, is, credited, for, its, introduction, every, taxonomist, since, then, starting, with, de, jussieu, and, de, candolle, has, used, ray, s, distinction, as, a, major, classification, characteristic, in, de, jussieu, s, system, 1789, he, followed, ray, arranging, his, monocotyledones, into, three, classes, based, on, stamen, position, and, placing, them, between, acotyledones, and, dicotyledones, de, candolle, s, system, 1813, which, was, to, predominate, thinking, through, much, of, the, 19th, century, used, a, similar, general, arrangement, with, two, subgroups, of, his, monocotyl, don, s, monocotyledoneae, lindley, 1830, followed, de, candolle, in, using, the, terms, monocotyledon, and, endogenae, interchangeably, they, considered, the, monocotyledons, to, be, a, group, of, vascular, plants, vasculares, whose, vascular, bundles, were, thought, to, arise, from, within, endog, nes, or, endogenous, monocotyledons, remained, in, a, similar, position, as, a, major, division, of, the, flowering, plants, throughout, the, nineteenth, century, with, minor, variations, george, bentham, and, hooker, 1862, 1883, used, monocotyledones, as, would, wettstein, while, august, eichler, used, mononocotyleae, and, engler, following, de, candolle, monocotyledoneae, in, the, twentieth, century, some, authors, used, alternative, names, such, as, bessey, s, 1915, alternifoliae, and, cronquist, s, 1966, liliatae, later, 1981, cronquist, changed, liliatae, to, liliopsida, usages, also, adopted, by, takhtajan, simultaneously, thorne, 1992, and, dahlgren, 1985, also, used, liliidae, as, a, synonym, taxonomists, had, considerable, latitude, in, naming, this, group, as, the, monocotyledons, were, a, group, above, the, rank, of, family, article, 16, of, the, icbn, allows, either, a, descriptive, botanical, name, or, a, name, formed, from, the, name, of, an, included, family, in, summary, they, have, been, variously, named, as, follows, over, the, 1980s, a, more, general, review, of, the, classification, of, angiosperms, was, undertaken, the, 1990s, saw, considerable, progress, in, plant, phylogenetics, and, cladistic, theory, initially, based, on, rbcl, gene, sequencing, and, cladistic, analysis, enabling, a, phylogenetic, tree, to, be, constructed, for, the, flowering, plants, the, establishment, of, major, new, clades, necessitated, a, departure, from, the, older, but, widely, used, classifications, such, as, cronquist, and, thorne, based, largely, on, morphology, rather, than, genetic, data, these, developments, complicated, discussions, on, plant, evolution, and, necessitated, a, major, taxonomic, restructuring, this, dna, based, molecular, phylogenetic, research, confirmed, on, the, one, hand, that, the, monocots, remained, as, a, well, defined, monophyletic, group, or, clade, in, contrast, to, the, other, historical, divisions, of, the, flowering, plants, which, had, to, be, substantially, reorganized, no, longer, could, the, angiosperms, be, simply, divided, into, monocotyledons, and, dicotyledons, it, was, apparent, that, the, monocotyledons, were, but, one, of, a, relatively, large, number, of, defined, groups, within, the, angiosperms, correlation, with, morphological, criteria, showed, that, the, defining, feature, was, not, cotyledon, number, but, the, separation, of, angiosperms, into, two, major, pollen, types, uniaperturate, monosulcate, and, monosulcate, derived, and, triaperturate, tricolpate, and, tricolpate, derived, with, the, monocots, situated, within, the, uniaperturate, groups, the, formal, taxonomic, ranking, of, monoctyledons, thus, became, replaced, with, monocots, as, an, informal, clade, this, is, the, name, that, has, been, most, commonly, used, since, the, publication, of, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, group, apg, system, in, 1998, and, regularly, updated, since, within, the, angiosperms, there, are, two, major, grades, a, small, early, branching, basal, grade, the, basal, angiosperms, ana, grade, with, three, lineages, and, a, larger, late, branching, grade, the, core, angiosperms, mesangiosperms, with, five, lineages, as, shown, in, the, cladogram, amborellales, nymphaeales, austrobaileyales, magnoliids, chloranthales, monocots, ceratophyllales, eudicots, while, the, monocotyledons, have, remained, extremely, stable, in, their, outer, borders, as, a, well, defined, and, coherent, monophylectic, group, the, deeper, internal, relationships, have, undergone, considerable, flux, with, many, competing, classification, systems, over, time, historically, bentham, 1877, considered, the, monocots, to, consist, of, four, alliances, epigynae, coronariae, nudiflorae, and, glumales, based, on, floral, characteristics, he, describes, the, attempts, to, subdivide, the, group, since, the, days, of, lindley, as, largely, unsuccessful, like, most, subsequent, classification, systems, it, failed, to, distinguish, between, two, major, orders, liliales, and, asparagales, now, recognised, as, quite, separate, a, major, advance, in, this, respect, was, the, work, of, rolf, dahlgren, 1980, which, would, form, the, basis, of, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, group, s, apg, subsequent, modern, classification, of, monocot, families, dahlgren, who, used, the, alternate, name, lilliidae, considered, the, monocots, as, a, subclass, of, angiosperms, characterised, by, a, single, cotyledon, and, the, presence, of, triangular, protein, bodies, in, the, sieve, tube, plastids, he, divided, the, monocots, into, seven, superorders, alismatiflorae, ariflorae, triuridiflorae, liliiflorae, zingiberiflorae, commeliniflorae, and, areciflorae, with, respect, to, the, specific, issue, regarding, liliales, and, asparagales, dahlgren, followed, huber, 1969, in, adopting, a, splitter, approach, in, contrast, to, the, longstanding, tendency, to, view, liliaceae, as, a, very, broad, sensu, lato, family, following, dahlgren, s, untimely, death, in, 1987, his, work, was, continued, by, his, widow, gertrud, dahlgren, who, published, a, revised, version, of, the, classification, in, 1989, in, this, scheme, the, suffix, florae, was, replaced, with, anae, e, g, alismatanae, and, the, number, of, superorders, expanded, to, ten, with, the, addition, of, bromelianae, cyclanthanae, and, pandananae, molecular, studies, have, both, confirmed, the, monophyly, of, the, monocots, and, helped, elucidate, relationships, within, this, group, the, apg, system, does, not, assign, the, monocots, to, a, taxonomic, rank, instead, recognizing, a, monocots, clade, however, there, has, remained, some, uncertainty, regarding, the, exact, relationships, between, the, major, lineages, with, a, number, of, competing, models, including, apg, the, apg, system, establishes, eleven, orders, of, monocots, these, form, three, grades, the, alismatid, monocots, lilioid, monocots, and, the, commelinid, monocots, by, order, of,

commelinales, of, some, 70, 000, species, by, far, the, largest, number, 65, are, found, in, two, families, the, orchids, and, grasses, the, orchids, orchidaceae, asparagales, contain, about, 25, 000, species, and, the, grasses, poaceae, poales, about, 11, 000, other, well, known, groups, within, the, poales, order, include, the, cyperaceae, sedges, and, juncaceae, rushes, and, the, monocots, also, include, familiar, families, such, as, the, palms, arecaceae, arecales, and, lilies, liliaceae, liliales, in, prephyletic, classification, systems, monocots, were, generally, positioned, between, plants, other, than, angiosperms, and, dicots, implying, that, monocots, were, more, primitive, with, the, introduction, of, phyletic, thinking, in, taxonomy, from, the, system, of, eichler, 1875, 1878, onwards, the, predominant, theory, of, monocot, origins, was, the, ranalean, ranalian, theory, particularly, in, the, work, of, bessey, 1915, which, traced, the, origin, of, all, flowering, plants, to, a, ranalean, type, and, reversed, the, sequence, making, dicots, the, more, primitive, group, the, monocots, form, a, monophyletic, group, arising, early, in, the, history, of, the, flowering, plants, but, the, fossil, record, is, meagre, the, earliest, fossils, presumed, to, be, monocot, remains, date, from, the, early, cretaceous, period, for, a, very, long, time, fossils, of, palm, trees, were, believed, to, be, the, oldest, monocots, first, appearing, 90, million, years, ago, mya, but, this, estimate, may, not, be, entirely, true, at, least, some, putative, monocot, fossils, have, been, found, in, strata, as, old, as, the, eudicots, the, oldest, fossils, that, are, unequivocally, monocots, are, pollen, from, the, late, barremian, aptian, early, cretaceous, period, about, 120, 110, million, years, ago, and, are, assignable, to, clade, pothoideae, monstereae, araceae, being, araceae, sister, to, other, alismatales, they, have, also, found, flower, fossils, of, triuridaceae, pandanales, in, upper, cretaceous, rocks, in, new, jersey, becoming, the, oldest, known, sighting, of, saprophytic, mycotrophic, habits, in, angiosperm, plants, and, among, the, oldest, known, fossils, of, monocotyledons, topology, of, the, angiosperm, phylogenetic, tree, could, imply, that, the, monocots, are, among, the, oldest, lineages, of, angiosperms, which, would, support, the, theory, that, they, are, just, as, old, as, the, eudicots, the, pollen, of, the, eudicots, dates, back, 125, million, years, so, the, lineage, of, monocots, should, be, that, old, too, k, re, bremer, using, rbcl, sequences, and, the, mean, path, length, method, for, estimating, divergence, times, estimated, the, age, of, the, monocot, crown, group, i, e, the, time, at, which, the, ancestor, of, today, s, acorus, diverged, from, the, rest, of, the, group, as, 134, million, years, similarly, wikstr, m, et, al, using, sanderson, s, non, parametric, rate, smoothing, approach, obtained, ages, of, 127, 141, million, years, for, the, crown, group, of, monocots, all, these, estimates, have, large, error, ranges, usually, 15, 20, and, wikstr, m, et, al, used, only, a, single, calibration, point, namely, the, split, between, fagales, and, cucurbitales, which, was, set, to, 84, ma, in, the, late, santonian, period, early, molecular, clock, studies, using, strict, clock, models, had, estimated, the, monocot, crown, age, to, 200, 20, million, years, ago, or, 160, 16, million, years, while, studies, using, relaxed, clocks, have, obtained, 135, 131, million, years, or, 133, 8, to, 124, million, years, bremer, s, estimate, of, 134, million, years, has, been, used, as, a, secondary, calibration, point, in, other, analyses, some, estimates, place, the, emergence, of, the, monocots, as, far, back, as, 150, mya, in, the, jurassic, period, the, age, of, the, core, group, of, so, called, nuclear, monocots, or, core, monocots, which, correspond, to, all, orders, except, acorales, and, alismatales, is, about, 131, million, years, to, present, and, crown, group, age, is, about, 126, million, years, to, the, present, the, subsequent, branching, in, this, part, of, the, tree, i, e, petrosaviaceae, dioscoreales, pandanales, and, liliales, clades, appeared, including, the, crown, petrosaviaceae, group, may, be, in, the, period, around, 125, 120, million, years, bc, about, 111, million, years, so, far, and, stem, groups, of, all, other, orders, including, commelinidae, would, have, diverged, about, or, shortly, after, 115, million, years, these, and, many, clades, within, these, orders, may, have, originated, in, southern, gondwana, i, e, antarctica, australasia, and, southern, south, america, the, aquatic, monocots, of, alismatales, have, commonly, been, regarded, as, primitive, they, have, also, been, considered, to, have, the, most, primitive, foliage, which, were, cross, linked, as, dioscoreales, and, melanthiales, keep, in, mind, that, the, most, primitive, monocot, is, not, necessarily, the, sister, of, everyone, else, this, is, because, the, ancestral, or, primitive, characters, are, inferred, by, means, of, the, reconstruction, of, character, states, with, the, help, of, the, phylogenetic, tree, so, primitive, characters, of, monocots, may, be, present, in, some, derived, groups, on, the, other, hand, the, basal, taxa, may, exhibit, many, morphological, autapomorphies, so, although, acoraceae, is, the, sister, group, to, the, remaining, monocotyledons, the, result, does, not, imply, that, acoraceae, is, the, most, primitive, monocot, in, terms, of, its, character, states, in, fact, acoraceae, is, highly, derived, in, many, morphological, characters, and, that, is, precisely, why, acoraceae, and, alismatales, occupied, relatively, derived, positions, in, the, trees, produced, by, chase, et, al, and, others, some, authors, support, the, idea, of, an, aquatic, phase, as, the, origin, of, monocots, the, phylogenetic, position, of, alismatales, many, water, which, occupy, a, relationship, with, the, rest, except, the, acoraceae, do, not, rule, out, the, idea, because, it, could, be, the, most, primitive, monocots, but, not, the, most, basal, the, atactostele, stem, the, long, and, linear, leaves, the, absence, of, secondary, growth, see, the, biomechanics, of, living, in, the, water, roots, in, groups, instead, of, a, single, root, branching, related, to, the, nature, of, the, substrate, including, sympodial, use, are, consistent, with, a, water, source, however, while, monocots, were, sisters, of, the, aquatic, ceratophyllales, or, their, origin, is, related, to, the, adoption, of, some, form, of, aquatic, habit, it, would, not, help, much, to, the, understanding, of, how, it, evolved, to, develop, their, distinctive, anatomical, features, the, monocots, seem, so, different, from, the, rest, of, angiosperms, and, it, s, difficult, to, relate, their, morphology, anatomy, and, development, and, those, of, broad, leaved, angiosperms, in, the, past, taxa, which, had, petiolate, leaves, with, reticulate, venation, were, considered, primitive, within, the, monocots, because, of, the, superficial, resemblance, to, the, leaves, of, dicotyledons, recent, work, suggests, that, while, these, taxa, are, sparse, in, the, phylogenetic, tree, of, monocots, such, as, fleshy, fruited, taxa, excluding, taxa, with, aril, seeds, dispersed, by, ants, the, two, features, would, be, adapted, to, conditions, that, evolved, together, regardless, among, the, taxa, involved, were, smilax, trillium, liliales, dioscorea, dioscoreales, etc, a, number, of, these, plants, are, vines, that, tend, to, live, in, shaded, habitats, for, at, least, part, of, their, lives, and, this, fact, may, also, relate, to, their, shapeless, stomata, reticulate, venation, seems, to, have, appeared, at, least, 26, times, in, monocots, and, fleshy, fruits, have, appeared, 21, times,

coordinated, convergence, the, name, monocotyledons, is, derived, from, the, traditional, botanical, name, monocotyledones, or, monocotyledoneae, in, latin, which, refers, to, the, fact, that, most, members, of, this, group, have, one, cotyledon, or, embryonic, leaf, in, their, seeds, some, monocots, such, as, grasses, have, hypogeal, emergence, where, the, mesocotyl, elongates, and, pushes, the, coleoptile, which, encloses, and, protects, the, shoot, tip, toward, the, soil, surface, since, elongation, occurs, above, the, cotyledon, it, is, left, in, place, in, the, soil, where, it, was, planted, many, dicots, have, epigeal, emergence, in, which, the, hypocotyl, elongates, and, becomes, arched, in, the, soil, as, the, hypocotyl, continues, to, elongate, it, pulls, the, cotyledons,
