tooth, decay, also, known, as, cavities, or, caries, is, the, breakdown, of, teeth, due, to, acids, produced, by, bacteria, the, cavities, may, be, a, number, of, different, colors, from, yellow, to, black, symptoms, may, include, pain, and, difficulty, eating, complications, may, include, inflammation, of, the, tissue, around, the, tooth, tooth, loss, and, infection, or, abscess, formation, tooth, regeneration, is, an, ongoing, stem, cell, based, field, of, study, that, aims, to, find, methods, to, reverse, the, effects, of, decay, current, methods, are, based, on, easing, symptoms, the, cause, of, cavities, is, acid, from, bacteria, dissolving, the, hard, tissues, of, the, teeth, enamel, dentin, and, cementum, the, acid, is, produced, by, the, bacteria, when, they, break, down, food, debris, or, sugar, on, the, tooth, surface, simple, sugars, in, food, are, these, bacteria, s, primary, energy, source, and, thus, a, diet, high, in, simple, sugar, is, a, risk, factor, if, mineral, breakdown, is, greater, than, buildup, from, sources, such, as, saliva, caries, results, risk, factors, include, conditions, that, result, in, less, saliva, such, as, diabetes, mellitus, sj, gren, syndrome, and, some, medications, medications, that, decrease, saliva, production, include, antihistamines, and, antidepressants, dental, caries, are, also, associated, with, poverty, poor, cleaning, of, the, mouth, and, receding, gums, resulting, in, exposure, of, the, roots, of, the, teeth, prevention, of, dental, caries, includes, regular, cleaning, of, the, teeth, a, diet, low, in, sugar, and, small, amounts, of, fluoride, brushing, one, s, teeth, twice, per, day, and, flossing, between, the, teeth, once, a, day, is, recommended, fluoride, may, be, acquired, from, water, salt, or, toothpaste, among, other, sources, treating, a, mother, s, dental, caries, may, decrease, the, risk, in, her, children, by, decreasing, the, number, of, certain, bacteria, she, may, spread, to, them, screening, can, result, in, earlier, detection, depending, on, the, extent, of, destruction, various, treatments, can, be, used, to, restore, the, tooth, to, proper, function, or, the, tooth, may, be, removed, there, is, no, known, method, to, grow, back, large, amounts, of, tooth, the, availability, of, treatment, is, often, poor, in, the, developing, world, paracetamol, acetaminophen, or, ibuprofen, may, be, taken, for, pain, worldwide, approximately, 3, 6, billion, people, 48, of, the, population, have, dental, caries, in, their, permanent, teeth, as, of, 2016, the, world, health, organization, estimates, that, nearly, all, adults, have, dental, caries, at, some, point, in, time, in, baby, teeth, it, affects, about, 620, million, people, or, 9, of, the, population, they, have, become, more, common, in, both, children, and, adults, in, recent, years, the, disease, is, most, common, in, the, developed, world, due, to, greater, simple, sugar, consumption, but, less, common, in, the, developing, world, caries, is, latin, for, rottenness, a, person, experiencing, caries, may, not, be, aware, of, the, disease, the, earliest, sign, of, a, new, carious, lesion, is, the, appearance, of, a, chalky, white, spot, on, the, surface, of, the, tooth, indicating, an, area, of, demineralization, of, enamel, this, is, referred, to, as, a, white, spot, lesion, an, incipient, carious, lesion, or, a, micro, cavity, as, the, lesion, continues, to, demineralize, it, can, turn, brown, but, will, eventually, turn, into, a, cavitation, cavity, before, the, cavity, forms, the, process, is, reversible, but, once, a, cavity, forms, the, lost, tooth, structure, cannot, be, regenerated, a, lesion, that, appears, dark, brown, and, shiny, suggests, dental, caries, were, once, present, but, the, demineralization, process, has, stopped, leaving, a, stain, active, decay, is, lighter, in, color, and, dull, in, appearance, as, the, enamel, and, dentin, are, destroyed, the, cavity, becomes, more, noticeable, the, affected, areas, of, the, tooth, change, color, and, become, soft, to, the, touch, once, the, decay, passes, through, the, enamel, the, dentinal, tubules, which, have, passages, to, the, nerve, of, the, tooth, become, exposed, resulting, in, pain, that, can, be, transient, temporarily, worsening, with, exposure, to, heat, cold, or, sweet, foods, and, drinks, a, tooth, weakened, by, extensive, internal, decay, can, sometimes, suddenly, fracture, under, normal, chewing, forces, when, the, decay, has, progressed, enough, to, allow, the, bacteria, to, overwhelm, the, pulp, tissue, in, the, center, of, the, tooth, a, toothache, can, result, and, the, pain, will, become, more, constant, death, of, the, pulp, tissue, and, infection, are, common, consequences, the, tooth, will, no, longer, be, sensitive, to, hot, or, cold, but, can, be, very, tender, to, pressure, dental, caries, can, also, cause, bad, breath, and, foul, tastes, in, highly, progressed, cases, an, infection, can, spread, from, the, tooth, to, the, surrounding, soft, tissues, complications, such, as, cavernous, sinus, thrombosis, and, ludwig, angina, can, be, life, threatening, four, things, are, required, for, caries, to, form, a, tooth, surface, enamel, or, dentin, caries, causing, bacteria, fermentable, carbohydrates, such, as, sucrose, and, time, this, involves, adherence, of, food, to, the, teeth, and, acid, creation, by, the, bacteria, that, makes, up, the, dental, plaque, however, these, four, criteria, are, not, always, enough, to, cause, the, disease, and, a, sheltered, environment, promoting, development, of, a, cariogenic, biofilm, is, required, the, caries, disease, process, does, not, have, an, inevitable, outcome, and, different, individuals, will, be, susceptible, to, different, degrees, depending, on, the, shape, of, their, teeth, oral, hygiene, habits, and, the, buffering, capacity, of, their, saliva, dental, caries, can, occur, on, any, surface, of, a, tooth, that, is, exposed, to, the, oral, cavity, but, not, the, structures, that, are, retained, within, the, bone, tooth, decay, is, caused, by, biofilm, dental, plaque, lying, on, the, teeth, and, maturing, to, become, cariogenic, causing, decay, certain, bacteria, in, the, biofilm, produce, acids, primarily, lactic, acid, in, the, presence, of, fermentable, carbohydrates, such, as, sucrose, fructose, and, glucose, caries, occur, more, often, in, people, from, the, lower, end, of, the, socio, economic, scale, than, people, from, the, upper, end, of, the, socio, economic, scale, due, to, lack, of, education, about, dental, care, and, lack, of, access, to, professional, dental, care, which, may, be, expensive, the, most, common, bacteria, associated, with, dental, cavities, are, the, mutans, streptococci, most, prominently, streptococcus, mutans, and, streptococcus, sobrinus, and, lactobacilli, however, cariogenic, bacteria, the, ones, that, can, cause, the, disease, are, present, in, dental, plaque, but, they, are, usually, in, too, low, concentrations, to, cause, problems, unless, there, is, a, shift, in, the, balance, this, is, driven, by, local, environmental, change, such, as, frequent, sugar, intake, or, inadequate, biofilm, removal, toothbrushing, if, left, untreated, the, disease, can, lead, to, pain, tooth, loss, and, infection, the, mouth, contains, a, wide, variety, of, oral, bacteria, but, only, a, few, specific, species, of, bacteria, are, believed, to, cause, dental, caries, streptococcus, mutans, and, lactobacillus, species, among, them, streptococcus, mutans, are, gram, positive, bacteria, which, constitute, biofilms, on, the, surface, of, teeth, these, organisms, can, produce, high, levels, of, lactic, acid, following, fermentation, of, dietary, sugars, and, are, resistant, to, the, adverse, effects, of, low, ph, properties, essential, for, cariogenic, bacteria, as, the, cementum, of, root, surfaces, is, more, easily, demineralized, than, enamel, surfaces, a, wider, variety, of, bacteria, can, cause, root, caries, including, lactobacillus, acidophilus, actinomyces, spp, nocardia, spp, and, streptococcus, mutans, bacteria, collect, around, the, teeth, and, gums, in, a, sticky, creamy, coloured, mass, called, plaque, which, serves, as, a, biofilm, some, sites, collect, plaque, more, commonly, than, others, for, example, sites, with, a, low, rate, of, salivary, flow, molar, fissures, grooves, on, the, occlusal, surfaces, of, molar, and, premolar, teeth, provide, microscopic, retention, sites, for, plaque, bacteria, as, do, the, interproximal, sites, plaque, may, also, collect, above, or, below, the, gingiva, where, it, is, referred, to, as, supra, or, sub, gingival, plaque, respectively, these, bacterial, strains, most, notably, s, mutans, can, be, inherited, by, a, child, from, a, caretaker, s, kiss, or, through, feeding, pre, masticated, food, bacteria, in, a, person, s, mouth, convert, glucose, fructose, and, most, commonly, sucrose, table, sugar, into, acids, mainly, lactic, acid, through, a, glycolytic, process, called, fermentation, if, left, in, contact, with, the, tooth, these, acids, may, cause, demineralization, which, is, the, dissolution, of, its, mineral, content, the, process, is, dynamic, however, as, remineralization, can, also, occur, if, the, acid, is, neutralized, by, saliva, or, mouthwash, fluoride, toothpaste, or, dental, varnish, may, aid, remineralization, if, demineralization, continues, over, time, enough, mineral, content, may, be, lost, so, that, the, soft, organic, material, left, behind, disintegrates, forming, a, cavity, or, hole, the, impact, such, sugars, have, on, the, progress, of, dental, caries, is, called, cariogenicity, sucrose, although, a, bound, glucose, and, fructose, unit, is, in, fact, more, cariogenic, than, a, mixture, of, equal, parts, of, glucose, and, fructose, this, is, due, to, the, bacteria, using, the, energy, in, the, saccharide, bond, between, the, glucose, and, fructose, subunits, s, mutans, adheres, to, the, biofilm, on, the, tooth, by, converting, sucrose, into, an, extremely, adhesive, substance, called, dextran, polysaccharide, by, the, enzyme, dextran, sucranase, the, frequency, with, which, teeth, are, exposed, to, cariogenic, acidic, environments, affects, the, likelihood, of, caries, development, after, meals, or, snacks, the, bacteria, in, the, mouth, metabolize, sugar, resulting, in, an, acidic, by, product, that, decreases, ph, as, time, progresses, the, ph, returns, to, normal, due, to, the, buffering, capacity, of, saliva, and, the, dissolved, mineral, content, of, tooth, surfaces, during, every, exposure, to, the, acidic, environment, portions, of, the, inorganic, mineral, content, at, the, surface, of, teeth, dissolve, and, can, remain, dissolved, for, two, hours, since, teeth, are, vulnerable, during, these, acidic, periods, the, development, of, dental, caries, relies, heavily, on, the, frequency, of, acid, exposure, the, carious, process, can, begin, within, days, of, a, tooth, s, erupting, into, the, mouth, if, the, diet, is, sufficiently, rich, in, suitable, carbohydrates, evidence, suggests, that, the, introduction, of, fluoride, treatments, has, slowed, the, process, proximal, caries, take, an, average, of, four, years, to, pass, through, enamel, in, permanent, teeth, because, the, cementum, enveloping, the, root, surface, is, not, nearly, as, durable, as, the, enamel, encasing, the, crown, root, caries, tend, to, progress, much, more, rapidly, than, decay, on, other, surfaces, the, progression, and, loss, of, mineralization, on, the, root, surface, is, 2, 5, times, faster, than, caries, in, enamel, in, very, severe, cases, where, oral, hygiene, is, very, poor, and, where, the, diet, is, very, rich, in, fermentable, carbohydrates, caries, may, cause, cavities, within, months, of, tooth, eruption, this, can, occur, for, example, when, children, continuously, drink, sugary, drinks, from, baby, bottles, see, later, discussion, there, are, certain, diseases, and, disorders, affecting, teeth, that, may, leave, an, individual, at, a, greater, risk, for, cavities, molar, incisor, hypo, mineralization, seems, to, be, increasingly, common, while, the, cause, is, unknown, it, is, thought, to, be, a, combination, of, genetic, and, environmental, factors, possible, contributing, factors, that, have, been, investigated, include, systemic, factors, such, as, high, levels, of, dioxins, or, polychlorinated, biphenyl, pcb, in, the, mother, s, milk, premature, birth, and, oxygen, deprivation, at, birth, and, certain, disorders, during, the, child, s, first, 3, years, such, as, mumps, diphtheria, scarlet, fever, measles, hypoparathyroidism, malnutrition, malabsorption, hypo, vitaminosis, d, chronic, respiratory, diseases, or, undiagnosed, and, untreated, coeliac, disease, which, usually, presents, with, mild, or, absent, gastrointestinal, symptoms, amelogenesis, imperfecta, which, occurs, in, between, 1, in, 718, and, 1, in, 14, 000, individuals, is, a, disease, in, which, the, enamel, does, not, fully, form, or, forms, in, insufficient, amounts, and, can, fall, off, a, tooth, in, both, cases, teeth, may, be, left, more, vulnerable, to, decay, because, the, enamel, is, not, able, to, protect, the, tooth, in, most, people, disorders, or, diseases, affecting, teeth, are, not, the, primary, cause, of, dental, caries, approximately, 96, of, tooth, enamel, is, composed, of, minerals, these, minerals, especially, hydroxyapatite, will, become, soluble, when, exposed, to, acidic, environments, enamel, begins, to, demineralize, at, a, ph, of, 5, 5, dentin, and, cementum, are, more, susceptible, to, caries, than, enamel, because, they, have, lower, mineral, content, thus, when, root, surfaces, of, teeth, are, exposed, from, gingival, recession, or, periodontal, disease, caries, can, develop, more, readily, even, in, a, healthy, oral, environment, however, the, tooth, is, susceptible, to, dental, caries, the, evidence, for, linking, malocclusion, and, or, crowding, to, dental, caries, is, weak, however, the, anatomy, of, teeth, may, affect, the, likelihood, of, caries, formation, where, the, deep, developmental, grooves, of, teeth, are, more, numerous, and, exaggerated, pit, and, fissure, caries, is, more, likely, to, develop, see, next, section, also, caries, is, more, likely, to, develop, when, food, is, trapped, between, teeth, reduced, salivary, flow, rate, is, associated, with, increased, caries, since, the, buffering, capability, of, saliva, is, not, present, to, counterbalance, the, acidic, environment, created, by, certain, foods, as, a, result, medical, conditions, that, reduce, the, amount, of, saliva, produced, by, salivary, glands, in, particular, the, submandibular, gland, and, parotid, gland, are, likely, to, lead, to, dry, mouth, and, thus, to, widespread, tooth, decay, examples, include, sj, gren, syndrome, diabetes, mellitus, diabetes, insipidus, and, sarcoidosis, medications, such, as, antihistamines, and, antidepressants, can, also, impair, salivary, flow, stimulants, most, notoriously, methylamphetamine, also, occlude, the, flow, of, saliva, to, an, extreme, degree, this, is, known, as, meth, mouth, tetrahydrocannabinol, thc, the, active, chemical, substance, in, cannabis, also, causes, a, nearly, complete, occlusion, of, salivation, known, in, colloquial, terms, as, cotton, mouth, moreover, 63, of, the, most, commonly, prescribed, medications, in, the, united, states, list, dry, mouth, as, a, known, side, effect, radiation, therapy, of, the, head, and, neck, may, also, damage, the, cells, in, salivary, glands, somewhat, increasing, the, likelihood, of, caries, formation, susceptibility, to, caries, can, be, related, to, altered, metabolism, in, the, tooth, in, particular, to, fluid, flow, in, the, dentin, experiments, on, rats, have, shown, that, a, high, sucrose, cariogenic, diet, significantly, suppresses, the, rate, of, fluid, motion, in, dentin, the, use, of, tobacco, may, also, increase, the, risk, for, caries, formation, some, brands, of, smokeless, tobacco, contain, high, sugar, content, increasing, susceptibility, to, caries, tobacco, use, is, a, significant, risk, factor, for, periodontal, disease, which, can, cause, the, gingiva, to, recede, as, the, gingiva, loses, attachment, to, the, teeth, due, to, gingival, recession, the, root, surface, becomes, more, visible, in, the, mouth, if, this, occurs, root, caries, is, a, concern, since, the, cementum, covering, the, roots, of, teeth, is, more, easily, demineralized, by, acids, than, enamel, currently, there, is, not, enough, evidence, to, support, a, causal, relationship, between, smoking, and, coronal, caries, but, evidence, does, suggest, a, relationship, between, smoking, and, root, surface, caries, exposure, of, children, to, secondhand, tobacco, smoke, is, associated, with, tooth, decay, intrauterine, and, neonatal, lead, exposure, promote, tooth, decay, besides, lead, all, atoms, with, electrical, charge, and, ionic, radius, similar, to, bivalent, calcium, such, as, cadmium, mimic, the, calcium, ion, and, therefore, exposure, to, them, may, promote, tooth, decay, poverty, is, also, a, significant, social, determinant, for, oral, health, dental, caries, have, been, linked, with, lower, socio, economic, status, and, can, be, considered, a, disease, of, poverty, forms, are, available, for, risk, assessment, for, caries, when, treating, dental, cases, this, system, using, the, evidence, based, caries, management, by, risk, assessment, cambra, it, is, still, unknown, if, the, identification, of, high, risk, individuals, can, lead, to, more, effective, long, term, patient, management, that, prevents, caries, initiation, and, arrests, or, reverses, the, progression, of, lesions, saliva, also, contains, iodine, and, egf, egf, results, effective, in, cellular, proliferation, differentiation, and, survival, salivary, egf, which, seems, also, regulated, by, dietary, inorganic, iodine, plays, an, important, physiological, role, in, the, maintenance, of, oral, and, gastro, oesophageal, tissue, integrity, and, on, the, other, hand, iodine, is, effective, in, prevention, of, dental, caries, and, oral, health, teeth, are, bathed, in, saliva, and, have, a, coating, of, bacteria, on, them, biofilm, that, continually, forms, the, development, of, biofilm, begins, with, pellicle, formation, pellicle, is, an, acellular, proteinaceous, film, which, covers, the, teeth, bacteria, colonize, on, the, teeth, by, adhering, to, the, pellicle, coated, surface, over, time, a, mature, biofilm, is, formed, creating, a, cariogenic, environment, on, the, tooth, surface, the, minerals, in, the, hard, tissues, of, the, teeth, enamel, dentin, and, cementum, are, constantly, undergoing, demineralization, and, remineralization, dental, caries, result, when, the, demineralization, rate, is, faster, than, the, remineralization, producing, net, mineral, loss, which, occurs, when, there, is, an, ecologic, shift, within, the, dental, biofilm, from, a, balanced, population, of, microorganisms, to, a, population, that, produces, acids, and, can, survive, in, an, acid, environment, tooth, enamel, is, a, highly, mineralized, acellular, tissue, and, caries, act, upon, it, through, a, chemical, process, brought, on, by, the, acidic, environment, produced, by, bacteria, as, the, bacteria, consume, the, sugar, and, use, it, for, their, own, energy, they, produce, lactic, acid, the, effects, of, this, process, include, the, demineralization, of, crystals, in, the, enamel, caused, by, acids, over, time, until, the, bacteria, physically, penetrate, the, dentin, enamel, rods, which, are, the, basic, unit, of, the, enamel, structure, run, perpendicularly, from, the, surface, of, the, tooth, to, the, dentin, since, demineralization, of, enamel, by, caries, follows, the, direction, of, the, enamel, rods, the, different, triangular, patterns, between, pit, and, fissure, and, smooth, surface, caries, develop, in, the, enamel, because, the, orientation, of, enamel, rods, are, different, in, the, two, areas, of, the, tooth, as, the, enamel, loses, minerals, and, dental, caries, progresses, the, enamel, develops, several, distinct, zones, visible, under, a, light, microscope, from, the, deepest, layer, of, the, enamel, to, the, enamel, surface, the, identified, areas, are, the, translucent, zone, dark, zones, body, of, the, lesion, and, surface, zone, the, translucent, zone, is, the, first, visible, sign, of, caries, and, coincides, with, a, one, to, two, percent, loss, of, minerals, a, slight, remineralization, of, enamel, occurs, in, the, dark, zone, which, serves, as, an, example, of, how, the, development, of, dental, caries, is, an, active, process, with, alternating, changes, the, area, of, greatest, demineralization, and, destruction, is, in, the, body, of, the, lesion, itself, the, surface, zone, remains, relatively, mineralized, and, is, present, until, the, loss, of, tooth, structure, results, in, a, cavitation, unlike, enamel, the, dentin, reacts, to, the, progression, of, dental, caries, after, tooth, formation, the, ameloblasts, which, produce, enamel, are, destroyed, once, enamel, formation, is, complete, and, thus, cannot, later, regenerate, enamel, after, its, destruction, on, the, other, hand, dentin, is, produced, continuously, throughout, life, by, odontoblasts, which, reside, at, the, border, between, the, pulp, and, dentin, since, odontoblasts, are, present, a, stimulus, such, as, caries, can, trigger, a, biologic, response, these, defense, mechanisms, include, the, formation, of, sclerotic, and, tertiary, dentin, in, dentin, from, the, deepest, layer, to, the, enamel, the, distinct, areas, affected, by, caries, are, the, advancing, front, the, zone, of, bacterial, penetration, and, the, zone, of, destruction, the, advancing, front, represents, a, zone, of, demineralized, dentin, due, to, acid, and, has, no, bacteria, present, the, zones, of, bacterial, penetration, and, destruction, are, the, locations, of, invading, bacteria, and, ultimately, the, decomposition, of, dentin, the, zone, of, destruction, has, a, more, mixed, bacterial, population, where, proteolytic, enzymes, have, destroyed, the, organic, matrix, the, innermost, dentin, caries, has, been, reversibly, attacked, because, the, collagen, matrix, is, not, severely, damaged, giving, it, potential, for, repair, the, structure, of, dentin, is, an, arrangement, of, microscopic, channels, called, dentinal, tubules, which, radiate, outward, from, the, pulp, chamber, to, the, exterior, cementum, or, enamel, border, the, diameter, of, the, dentinal, tubules, is, largest, near, the, pulp, about, 2, 5, m, and, smallest, about, 900, nm, at, the, junction, of, dentin, and, enamel, the, carious, process, continues, through, the, dentinal, tubules, which, are, responsible, for, the, triangular, patterns, resulting, from, the, progression, of, caries, deep, into, the, tooth, the, tubules, also, allow, caries, to, progress, faster, in, response, the, fluid, inside, the, tubules, brings, immunoglobulins, from, the, immune, system, to, fight, the, bacterial, infection, at, the, same, time, there, is, an, increase, of, mineralization, of, the, surrounding, tubules, this, results, in, a, constriction, of, the, tubules, which, is, an, attempt, to, slow, the, bacterial, progression, in, addition, as, the, acid, from, the, bacteria, demineralizes, the, hydroxyapatite, crystals, calcium, and, phosphorus, are, released, allowing, for, the, precipitation, of, more, crystals, which, fall, deeper, into, the, dentinal, tubule, these, crystals, form, a, barrier, and, slow, the, advancement, of, caries, after, these, protective, responses, the, dentin, is, considered, sclerotic, according, to, hydrodynamic, theory, fluids, within, dentinal, tubules, are, believed, to, be, the, mechanism, by, which, pain, receptors, are, triggered, within, the, pulp, of, the, tooth, since, sclerotic, dentin, prevents, the, passage, of, such, fluids, pain, that, would, otherwise, serve, as, a, warning, of, the, invading, bacteria, may, not, develop, at, first, in, response, to, dental, caries, there, may, be, production, of, more, dentin, toward, the, direction, of, the, pulp, this, new, dentin, is, referred, to, as, tertiary, dentin, tertiary, dentin, is, produced, to, protect, the, pulp, for, as, long, as, possible, from, the, advancing, bacteria, as, more, tertiary, dentin, is, produced, the, size, of, the, pulp, decreases, this, type, of, dentin, has, been, subdivided, according, to, the, presence, or, absence, of, the, original, odontoblasts, if, the, odontoblasts, survive, long, enough, to, react, to, the, dental, caries, then, the, dentin, produced, is, called, reactionary, dentin, if, the, odontoblasts, are, killed, the, dentin, produced, is, called, reparative, dentin, in, the, case, of, reparative, dentin, other, cells, are, needed, to, assume, the, role, of, the, destroyed, odontoblasts, growth, factors, especially, tgf, are, thought, to, initiate, the, production, of, reparative, dentin, by, fibroblasts, and, mesenchymal, cells, of, the, pulp, reparative, dentin, is, produced, at, an, average, of, 1, 5, m, day, but, can, be, increased, to, 3, 5, m, day, the, resulting, dentin, contains, irregularly, shaped, dentinal, tubules, that, may, not, line, up, with, existing, dentinal, tubules, this, diminishes, the, ability, for, dental, caries, to, progress, within, the, dentinal, tubules, the, incidence, of, cemental, caries, increases, in, older, adults, as, gingival, recession, occurs, from, either, trauma, or, periodontal, disease, it, is, a, chronic, condition, that, forms, a, large, shallow, lesion, and, slowly, invades, first, the, root, s, cementum, and, then, dentin, to, cause, a, chronic, infection, of, the, pulp, see, further, discussion, under, classification, by, affected, hard, tissue, because, dental, pain, is, a, late, finding, many, lesions, are, not, detected, early, resulting, in, restorative, challenges, and, increased, tooth, loss, the, presentation, of, caries, is, highly, variable, however, the, risk, factors, and, stages, of, development, are, similar, initially, it, may, appear, as, a, small, chalky, area, smooth, surface, caries, which, may, eventually, develop, into, a, large, cavitation, sometimes, caries, may, be, directly, visible, however, other, methods, of, detection, such, as, x, rays, are, used, for, less, visible, areas, of, teeth, and, to, judge, the, extent, of, destruction, lasers, for, detecting, caries, allow, detection, without, ionizing, radiation, and, are, now, used, for, detection, of, interproximal, decay, between, the, teeth, primary, diagnosis, involves, inspection, of, all, visible, tooth, surfaces, using, a, good, light, source, dental, mirror, and, explorer, dental, radiographs, x, rays, may, show, dental, caries, before, it, is, otherwise, visible, in, particular, caries, between, the, teeth, large, areas, of, dental, caries, are, often, apparent, to, the, naked, eye, but, smaller, lesions, can, be, difficult, to, identify, visual, and, tactile, inspection, along, with, radiographs, are, employed, frequently, among, dentists, in, particular, to, diagnose, pit, and, fissure, caries, early, uncavitated, caries, is, often, diagnosed, by, blowing, air, across, the, suspect, surface, which, removes, moisture, and, changes, the, optical, properties, of, the, unmineralized, enamel, some, dental, researchers, have, cautioned, against, the, use, of, dental, explorers, to, find, caries, in, particular, sharp, ended, explorers, in, cases, where, a, small, area, of, tooth, has, begun, demineralizing, but, has, not, yet, cavitated, the, pressure, from, the, dental, explorer, could, cause, a, cavity, since, the, carious, process, is, reversible, before, a, cavity, is, present, it, may, be, possible, to, arrest, caries, with, fluoride, and, remineralize, the, tooth, surface, when, a, cavity, is, present, a, restoration, will, be, needed, to, replace, the, lost, tooth, structure, at, times, pit, and, fissure, caries, may, be, difficult, to, detect, bacteria, can, penetrate, the, enamel, to, reach, dentin, but, then, the, outer, surface, may, remineralize, especially, if, fluoride, is, present, these, caries, sometimes, referred, to, as, hidden, caries, will, still, be, visible, on, x, ray, radiographs, but, visual, examination, of, the, tooth, would, show, the, enamel, intact, or, minimally, perforated, the, differential, diagnosis, for, dental, caries, includes, dental, fluorosis, and, developmental, defects, of, the, tooth, including, hypomineralization, of, the, tooth, and, hypoplasia, of, the, tooth, the, early, carious, lesion, is, characterized, by, demineralization, of, the, tooth, surface, altering, the, tooth, s, optical, properties, technology, using, laser, speckle, image, lsi, techniques, may, provide, a, diagnostic, aid, to, detect, early, carious, lesions, caries, can, be, classified, by, location, etiology, rate, of, progression, and, affected, hard, tissues, these, forms, of, classification, can, be, used, to, characterize, a, particular, case, of, tooth, decay, to, more, accurately, represent, the, condition, to, others, and, also, indicate, the, severity, of, tooth, destruction, in, some, instances, caries, is, described, in, other, ways, that, might, indicate, the, cause, the, g, v, black, classification, is, as, follows, early, childhood, caries, ecc, also, known, as, baby, bottle, caries, baby, bottle, tooth, decay, or, bottle, rot, is, a, pattern, of, decay, found, in, young, children, with, their, deciduous, baby, teeth, this, must, include, the, presence, of, at, least, one, carious, lesion, on, a, primary, tooth, in, a, child, under, the, age, of, 6, years, the, teeth, most, likely, affected, are, the, maxillary, anterior, teeth, but, all, teeth, can, be, affected, the, name, for, this, type, of, caries, comes, from, the, fact, that, the, decay, usually, is, a, result, of, allowing, children, to, fall, asleep, with, sweetened, liquids, in, their, bottles, or, feeding, children, sweetened, liquids, multiple, times, during, the, day, another, pattern, of, decay, is, rampant, caries, which, signifies, advanced, or, severe, decay, on, multiple, surfaces, of, many, teeth, rampant, caries, may, be, seen, in, individuals, with, xerostomia, poor, oral, hygiene, stimulant, use, due, to, drug, induced, dry, mouth, and, or, large, sugar, intake, if, rampant, caries, is, a, result, of, previous, radiation, to, the, head, and, neck, it, may, be, described, as, radiation, induced, caries, problems, can, also, be, caused, by, the, self, destruction, of, roots, and, whole, tooth, resorption, when, new, teeth, erupt, or, later, from, unknown, causes, children, at, 6, 12, months, are, at, increased, risk, of, developing, dental, caries, for, other, children, aged, 12, 18, months, dental, caries, develop, on, primary, teeth, and, approximately, twice, yearly, for, permanent, teeth, a, range, of, studies, have, reported, that, there, is, a, correlation, between, caries, in, primary, teeth, and, caries, in, permanent, teeth, temporal, descriptions, can, be, applied, to, caries, to, indicate, the, progression, rate, and, previous, history, acute, signifies, a, quickly, developing, condition, whereas, chronic, describes, a, condition, that, has, taken, an, extended, time, to, develop, in, which, thousands, of, meals, and, snacks, many, causing, some, acid, demineralization, that, is, not, remineralized, eventually, result, in, cavities, recurrent, caries, also, described, as, secondary, are, caries, that, appear, at, a, location, with, a, previous, history, of, caries, this, is, frequently, found, on, the, margins, of, fillings, and, other, dental, restorations, on, the, other, hand, incipient, caries, describes, decay, at, a, location, that, has, not, experienced, previous, decay, arrested, caries, describes, a, lesion, on, a, tooth, that, was, previously, demineralized, but, was, remineralized, before, causing, a, cavitation, fluoride, treatment, can, help, recalcification, of, tooth, enamel, as, well, as, the, use, of, amorphous, calcium, phosphate, micro, invasive, interventions, such, as, dental, sealant, or, resin, infiltration, have, been, shown, to, slow, down, the, progression, of, proximal, decay, depending, on, which, hard, tissues, are, affected, it, is, possible, to, describe, caries, as, involving, enamel, dentin, or, cementum, early, in, its, development, caries, may, affect, only, enamel, once, the, extent, of, decay, reaches, the, deeper, layer, of, dentin, the, term, dentinal, caries, is, used, since, cementum, is, the, hard, tissue, that, covers, the, roots, of, teeth, it, is, not, often, affected, by, decay, unless, the, roots, of, teeth, are, exposed, to, the, mouth, although, the, term, cementum, caries, may, be, used, to, describe, the, decay, on, roots, of, teeth, very, rarely, does, caries, affect, the, cementum, alone, the, primary, approach, to, dental, hygiene, care, consists, of, tooth, brushing, and, flossing, the, purpose, of, oral, hygiene, is, to, remove, and, prevent, the, formation, of, plaque, or, dental, biofilm, although, studies, have, shown, this, effect, on, caries, is, limited, while, there, is, no, evidence, that, flossing, prevents, tooth, decay, the, practice, is, still, generally, recommended, a, toothbrush, can, be, used, to, remove, plaque, on, accessible, surfaces, but, not, between, teeth, or, inside, pits, and, fissures, on, chewing, surfaces, when, used, correctly, dental, floss, removes, plaque, from, areas, that, could, otherwise, develop, proximal, caries, but, only, if, the, depth, of, sulcus, has, not, been, compromised, additional, aids, include, interdental, brushes, water, picks, and, mouthwashes, the, use, of, rotational, electric, toothbrushes, might, reduce, the, risk, of, plaque, and, gingivitis, though, it, is, unclear, whether, they, are, of, clinical, importance, however, oral, hygiene, is, effective, at, preventing, gum, disease, gingivitis, periodontal, disease, food, is, forced, inside, pits, and, fissures, under, chewing, pressure, leading, to, carbohydrate, fuelled, acid, demineralisation, where, the, brush, fluoride, toothpaste, and, saliva, have, no, access, to, remove, trapped, food, neutralise, acid, or, remineralise, tooth, enamel, occlusal, caries, accounts, for, between, 80, and, 90, of, caries, in, children, weintraub, 2001, unlike, brushing, fluoride, leads, to, proven, reduction, in, caries, incidence, by, approximately, 25, higher, concentrations, of, fluoride, 1, 000, ppm, in, toothpaste, also, helps, prevents, tooth, decay, with, the, effect, increasing, with, concentration, up, to, a, plateau, a, randomized, clinical, trial, demonstrated, that, toothpastes, that, contain, arginine, have, greater, protection, against, tooth, cavitation, than, the, regular, fluoride, toothpastes, containing, 1450, ppm, alone, a, cochrane, review, has, confirmed, that, the, use, of, fluoride, gels, normally, applied, by, a, dental, professional, from, once, to, several, times, a, year, assists, in, the, prevention, of, tooth, decay, in, children, and, adolescents, reiterating, the, importance, of, fluoride, as, the, principal, means, of, caries, prevention, another, review, concluded, that, the, supervised, regular, use, of, a, fluoride, mouthwash, greatly, reduced, the, onset, of, decay, in, the, permanent, teeth, of, children, professional, hygiene, care, consists, of, regular, dental, examinations, and, professional, prophylaxis, cleaning, sometimes, complete, plaque, removal, is, difficult, and, a, dentist, or, dental, hygienist, may, be, needed, along, with, oral, hygiene, radiographs, may, be, taken, at, dental, visits, to, detect, possible, dental, caries, development, in, high, risk, areas, of, the, mouth, e, g, bitewing, x, rays, which, visualize, the, crowns, of, the, back, teeth, alternative, methods, of, oral, hygiene, also, exist, around, the, world, such, as, the, use, of, teeth, cleaning, twigs, such, as, miswaks, in, some, middle, eastern, and, african, cultures, there, is, some, limited, evidence, demonstrating, the, efficacy, of, these, alternative, methods, of, oral, hygiene, people, who, eat, more, free, sugars, get, more, cavities, with, cavities, increasing, exponentially, with, increasing, sugar, intake, populations, with, less, sugar, intake, have, fewer, cavities, in, one, population, in, nigeria, where, sugar, consumption, was, about, 2g, day, only, two, percent, of, the, population, of, any, age, had, had, a, cavity, chewy, and, sticky, foods, such, as, candy, cookies, potato, chips, and, crackers, tend, to, adhere, to, teeth, longer, however, dried, fruits, such, as, raisins, and, fresh, fruit, such, as, apples, and, bananas, disappear, from, the, mouth, quickly, and, do, not, appear, to, be, a, risk, factor, consumers, are, not, good, at, guessing, which, foods, stick, around, in, the, mouth, for, children, the, american, dental, association, and, the, european, academy, of, paediatric, dentistry, recommend, limiting, the, frequency, of, consumption, of, drinks, with, sugar, and, not, giving, baby, bottles, to, infants, during, sleep, see, earlier, discussion, parents, are, also, recommended, to, avoid, sharing, utensils, and, cups, with, their, infants, to, prevent, transferring, bacteria, from, the, parent, s, mouth, xylitol, is, a, naturally, occurring, sugar, alcohol, that, is, used, in, different, products, as, an, alternative, to, sucrose, table, sugar, as, of, 2015, the, evidence, concerning, the, use, of, xylitol, in, chewing, gum, was, insufficient, to, determine, if, it, is, effective, at, preventing, caries, the, use, of, dental, sealants, is, a, means, of, prevention, a, sealant, is, a, thin, plastic, like, coating, applied, to, the, chewing, surfaces, of, the, molars, to, prevent, food, from, being, trapped, inside, pits, and, fissures, this, deprives, resident, plaque, bacteria, of, carbohydrate, preventing, the, formation, of, pit, and, fissure, caries, sealants, are, usually, applied, on, the, teeth, of, children, as, soon, as, the, teeth, erupt, but, adults, are, receiving, them, if, not, previously, performed, sealants, can, wear, out, and, fail, to, prevent, access, of, food, and, plaque, bacteria, inside, pits, and, fissures, and, need, to, be, replaced, so, they, must, be, checked, regularly, by, dental, professionals, dental, sealants, have, been, shown, to, be, more, effective, at, preventing, occlusal, decay, when, compared, to, fluoride, varnish, applications, calcium, as, found, in, food, such, as, milk, and, green, vegetables, is, often, recommended, to, protect, against, dental, caries, fluoride, helps, prevent, decay, of, a, tooth, by, binding, to, the, hydroxyapatite, crystals, in, enamel, streptococcus, mutans, is, the, leading, cause, of, tooth, decay, low, concentration, fluoride, ions, act, as, bacteriostatic, therapeutic, agent, and, high, concentration, fluoride, ions, are, bactericidal, the, incorporated, fluorine, makes, enamel, more, resistant, to, demineralization, and, thus, resistant, to, decay, fluoride, can, be, found, in, either, topical, or, systemic, form, topical, fluoride, is, more, highly, recommended, than, systemic, intake, to, protect, the, surface, of, the, teeth, topical, fluoride, is, used, in, toothpaste, mouthwash, and, fluoride, varnish, standard, fluoride, toothpaste, 1, 000, 1, 500, ppm, is, more, effective, than, low, fluoride, toothpaste, 600ppm, to, prevent, dental, caries, it, is, recommended, that, all, adult, patients, to, use, fluoridated, toothpaste, with, at, least, 1350ppm, fluoride, content, brushing, at, least, 2, times, per, day, and, brush, right, before, bed, for, children, and, young, adults, use, fluoridated, toothpaste, with, 1350ppm, to, 1500ppm, fluoride, content, brushing, 2, times, per, day, and, also, brush, right, before, bed, american, dental, association, council, suggest, that, for, children, 3, years, old, caregivers, should, begin, brushing, their, teeth, by, using, fluoridated, toothpaste, with, an, amount, no, more, than, a, smear, supervised, toothbrushing, must, also, be, done, to, children, below, 8, years, of, age, to, prevent, swallowing, of, toothpaste, after, brushing, with, fluoride, toothpaste, rinsing, should, be, avoided, and, the, excess, spat, out, many, dental, professionals, include, application, of, topical, fluoride, solutions, as, part, of, routine, visits, and, recommend, the, use, of, xylitol, and, amorphous, calcium, phosphate, products, silver, diamine, fluoride, may, work, better, than, fluoride, varnish, to, prevent, cavities, systemic, fluoride, is, found, as, lozenges, tablets, drops, and, water, fluoridation, these, are, ingested, orally, to, provide, fluoride, systemically, water, fluoridation, has, been, shown, to, be, beneficial, to, prevent, tooth, decay, especially, in, low, social, economical, areas, where, other, forms, of, fluoride, is, not, available, however, a, cochrane, systematic, review, found, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, taking, fluoride, systemically, daily, in, pregnant, women, was, effective, in, preventing, dental, decay, in, their, offspring, while, some, products, containing, chlorhexidine, have, been, shown, to, limit, the, progression, of, existing, tooth, decay, there, is, currently, no, evidence, suggesting, that, chlorhexidine, gels, and, varnishes, can, prevent, dental, caries, or, reduce, the, population, of, streptococcus, mutans, in, the, mouth, an, oral, health, assessment, carried, out, before, a, child, reaches, the, age, of, one, may, help, with, management, of, caries, the, oral, health, assessment, should, include, checking, the, child, s, history, a, clinical, examination, checking, the, risk, of, caries, in, the, child, including, the, state, of, their, occlusion, and, assessing, how, well, equipped, the, child, s, parent, or, carer, is, to, help, the, child, prevent, caries, to, further, increase, a, child, s, cooperation, in, caries, management, good, communication, by, the, dentist, and, the, rest, of, the, staff, of, a, dental, practice, should, be, used, this, communication, can, be, improved, by, calling, the, child, by, their, name, using, eye, contact, and, including, them, in, any, conversation, about, their, treatment, vaccines, are, also, under, development, most, importantly, whether, the, carious, lesion, is, cavitated, or, non, cavitated, dictates, the, management, clinical, assessment, of, whether, the, lesion, is, active, or, arrested, is, also, important, noncavitated, lesions, can, be, arrested, and, remineralization, can, occur, under, the, right, conditions, however, this, may, require, extensive, changes, to, the, diet, reduction, in, frequency, of, refined, sugars, improved, oral, hygiene, toothbrushing, twice, per, day, with, fluoride, toothpaste, and, daily, flossing, and, regular, application, of, topical, fluoride, more, recently, immunoglobulin, y, specific, to, streptococcus, mutans, has, been, used, to, suppress, growth, of, s, mutans, such, management, of, a, carious, lesion, is, termed, non, operative, since, no, drilling, is, carried, out, on, the, tooth, non, operative, treatment, requires, excellent, understanding, and, motivation, from, the, individual, otherwise, the, decay, will, continue, once, a, lesion, has, cavitated, especially, if, dentin, is, involved, remineralization, is, much, more, difficult, and, a, dental, restoration, is, usually, indicated, operative, treatment, before, a, restoration, can, be, placed, all, of, the, decay, must, be, removed, otherwise, it, will, continue, to, progress, underneath, the, filling, sometimes, a, small, amount, of, decay, can, be, left, if, it, is, entombed, and, there, is, a, seal, which, isolates, the, bacteria, from, their, substrate, this, can, be, likened, to, placing, a, glass, container, over, a, candle, which, burns, itself, out, once, the, oxygen, is, used, up, techniques, such, as, stepwise, caries, removal, are, designed, to, avoid, exposure, of, the, dental, pulp, and, overall, reduction, of, the, amount, of, tooth, substance, which, requires, removal, before, the, final, filling, is, placed, often, enamel, which, overlies, decayed, dentin, must, also, be, removed, as, it, is, unsupported, and, susceptible, to, fracture, the, modern, decision, making, process, with, regards, the, activity, of, the, lesion, and, whether, it, is, cavitated, is, summarized, in, the, table, destroyed, tooth, structure, does, not, fully, regenerate, although, remineralization, of, very, small, carious, lesions, may, occur, if, dental, hygiene, is, kept, at, optimal, level, for, the, small, lesions, topical, fluoride, is, sometimes, used, to, encourage, remineralization, for, larger, lesions, the, progression, of, dental, caries, can, be, stopped, by, treatment, the, goal, of, treatment, is, to, preserve, tooth, structures, and, prevent, further, destruction, of, the, tooth, aggressive, treatment, by, filling, of, incipient, carious, lesions, places, where, there, is, superficial, damage, to, the, enamel, is, controversial, as, they, may, heal, themselves, while, once, a, filling, is, performed, it, will, eventually, have, to, be, redone, and, the, site, serves, as, a, vulnerable, site, for, further, decay, in, general, early, treatment, is, quicker, and, less, expensive, than, treatment, of, extensive, decay, local, anesthetics, nitrous, oxide, laughing, gas, or, other, prescription, medications, may, be, required, in, some, cases, to, relieve, pain, during, or, following, treatment, or, to, relieve, anxiety, during, treatment, a, dental, handpiece, drill, is, used, to, remove, large, portions, of, decayed, material, from, a, tooth, a, spoon, a, dental, instrument, used, to, carefully, remove, decay, is, sometimes, employed, when, the, decay, in, dentin, reaches, near, the, pulp, some, dentists, remove, dental, caries, using, a, laser, rather, than, the, traditional, dental, drill, a, cochrane, review, of, this, technique, looked, at, er, yag, erbium, doped, yttrium, aluminium, garnet, er, cr, ysgg, erbium, chromium, yttrium, scandium, gallium, garnet, and, nd, yag, neodymium, doped, yttrium, aluminium, garnet, lasers, and, found, that, although, people, treated, with, lasers, compared, to, a, conventional, dental, drill, experienced, less, pain, and, had, a, lesser, need, for, dental, anaesthesia, that, overall, there, was, little, difference, in, caries, removal, another, alternative, to, drilling, or, lasers, for, small, caries, is, the, use, of, air, abrasion, in, which, small, abrasive, particles, are, blasted, at, decay, using, pressurized, air, similar, to, sand, blasting, once, the, cary, is, removed, the, missing, tooth, structure, requires, a, dental, restoration, of, some, sort, to, return, the, tooth, to, function, and, aesthetic, condition, restorative, materials, include, dental, amalgam, composite, resin, glass, ionomer, cement, porcelain, and, gold, composite, resin, and, porcelain, can, be, made, to, match, the, color, of, a, patient, s, natural, teeth, and, are, thus, used, more, frequently, when, aesthetics, are, a, concern, composite, restorations, are, not, as, strong, as, dental, amalgam, and, gold, some, dentists, consider, the, latter, as, the, only, advisable, restoration, for, posterior, areas, where, chewing, forces, are, great, when, the, decay, is, too, extensive, there, may, not, be, enough, tooth, structure, remaining, to, allow, a, restorative, material, to, be, placed, within, the, tooth, thus, a, crown, may, be, needed, this, restoration, appears, similar, to, a, cap, and, is, fitted, over, the, remainder, of, the, natural, crown, of, the, tooth, crowns, are, often, made, of, gold, porcelain, or, porcelain, fused, to, metal, for, children, preformed, crowns, are, available, to, place, over, the, tooth, these, are, usually, made, of, metal, usually, stainless, steel, but, increasingly, there, are, aesthetic, materials, traditionally, teeth, are, shaved, down, to, make, room, for, the, crown, but, more, recently, stainless, steel, crowns, have, been, used, to, seal, decay, into, the, tooth, and, stop, it, progressing, this, is, known, as, the, hall, technique, and, works, by, depriving, the, bacteria, in, the, decay, of, nutrients, and, making, their, environment, less, favorable, for, them, it, is, a, minimally, invasive, method, of, managing, decay, in, children, and, does, not, require, local, anesthetic, injections, in, the, mouth, in, certain, cases, endodontic, therapy, may, be, necessary, for, the, restoration, of, a, tooth, endodontic, therapy, also, known, as, a, root, canal, is, recommended, if, the, pulp, in, a, tooth, dies, from, infection, by, decay, causing, bacteria, or, from, trauma, in, root, canal, therapy, the, pulp, of, the, tooth, including, the, nerve, and, vascular, tissues, is, removed, along, with, decayed, portions, of, the, tooth, the, canals, are, instrumented, with, endodontic, files, to, clean, and, shape, them, and, they, are, then, usually, filled, with, a, rubber, like, material, called, gutta, percha, the, tooth, is, filled, and, a, crown, can, be, placed, upon, completion, of, root, canal, therapy, the, tooth, is, non, vital, as, it, is, devoid, of, any, living, tissue, an, extraction, can, also, serve, as, treatment, for, dental, caries, the, removal, of, the, decayed, tooth, is, performed, if, the, tooth, is, too, far, destroyed, from, the, decay, process, to, effectively, restore, the, tooth, extractions, are, sometimes, considered, if, the, tooth, lacks, an, opposing, tooth, or, will, probably, cause, further, problems, in, the, future, as, may, be, the, case, for, wisdom, teeth, extractions, may, also, be, preferred, by, people, unable, or, unwilling, to, undergo, the, expense, or, difficulties, in, restoring, the, tooth, worldwide, approximately, 3, 6, billion, people, have, dental, caries, in, their, permanent, teeth, in, baby, teeth, it, affects, about, 620, million, people, or, 9, of, the, population, the, disease, is, most, common, in, latin, american, countries, countries, in, the, middle, east, and, south, asia, and, least, prevalent, in, china, in, the, united, states, dental, caries, is, the, most, common, chronic, childhood, disease, being, at, least, five, times, more, common, than, asthma, it, is, the, primary, pathological, cause, of, tooth, loss, in, children, between, 29, and, 59, of, adults, over, the, age, of, 50, experience, caries, treating, dental, cavities, costs, 5, 10, of, health, care, budgets, in, industrialized, countries, and, can, easily, exceed, budgets, in, lower, income, countries, the, number, of, cases, has, decreased, in, some, developed, countries, and, this, decline, is, usually, attributed, to, increasingly, better, oral, hygiene, practices, and, preventive, measures, such, as, fluoride, treatment, nonetheless, countries, that, have, experienced, an, overall, decrease, in, cases, of, tooth, decay, continue, to, have, a, disparity, in, the, distribution, of, the, disease, among, children, in, the, united, states, and, europe, twenty, percent, of, the, population, endures, sixty, to, eighty, percent, of, cases, of, dental, caries, a, similarly, skewed, distribution, of, the, disease, is, found, throughout, the, world, with, some, children, having, none, or, very, few, caries, and, others, having, a, high, number, australia, nepal, and, sweden, where, children, receive, dental, care, paid, for, by, the, government, have, a, low, incidence, of, cases, of, dental, caries, among, children, whereas, cases, are, more, numerous, in, costa, rica, and, slovakia, the, classic, dmf, decay, missing, filled, index, is, one, of, the, most, common, methods, for, assessing, caries, prevalence, as, well, as, dental, treatment, needs, among, populations, this, index, is, based, on, in, field, clinical, examination, of, individuals, by, using, a, probe, mirror, and, cotton, rolls, because, the, dmf, index, is, done, without, x, ray, imaging, it, underestimates, real, caries, prevalence, and, treatment, needs, bacteria, typically, associated, with, dental, caries, have, been, isolated, from, vaginal, samples, from, females, who, have, bacterial, vaginosis, there, is, a, long, history, of, dental, caries, over, a, million, years, ago, hominins, such, as, paranthropus, had, cavities, the, largest, increases, in, the, prevalence, of, caries, have, been, associated, with, dietary, changes, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, tooth, decay, is, an, ancient, disease, dating, far, into, prehistory, skulls, dating, from, a, million, years, ago, through, the, neolithic, period, show, signs, of, caries, including, those, from, the, paleolithic, and, mesolithic, ages, the, increase, of, caries, during, the, neolithic, period, may, be, attributed, to, the, increased, consumption, of, plant, foods, containing, carbohydrates, the, beginning, of, rice, cultivation, in, south, asia, is, also, believed, to, have, caused, an, increase, in, caries, especially, for, women, although, there, is, also, some, evidence, from, sites, in, thailand, such, as, khok, phanom, di, that, shows, a, decrease, in, overall, percentage, of, dental, caries, with, the, increase, in, dependence, on, rice, agriculture, a, sumerian, text, from, 5000, bc, describes, a, tooth, worm, as, the, cause, of, caries, evidence, of, this, belief, has, also, been, found, in, india, egypt, japan, and, china, unearthed, ancient, skulls, show, evidence, of, primitive, dental, work, in, pakistan, teeth, dating, from, around, 5500, bc, to, 7000, bc, show, nearly, perfect, holes, from, primitive, dental, drills, the, ebers, papyrus, an, egyptian, text, from, 1550, bc, mentions, diseases, of, teeth, during, the, sargonid, dynasty, of, assyria, during, 668, to, 626, bc, writings, from, the, king, s, physician, specify, the, need, to, extract, a, tooth, due, to, spreading, inflammation, in, the, roman, empire, wider, consumption, of, cooked, foods, led, to, a, small, increase, in, caries, prevalence, the, greco, roman, civilization, in, addition, to, the, egyptian, civilization, had, treatments, for, pain, resulting, from, caries, the, rate, of, caries, remained, low, through, the, bronze, age, and, iron, age, but, sharply, increased, during, the, middle, ages, periodic, increases, in, caries, prevalence, had, been, small, in, comparison, to, the, 1000, ad, increase, when, sugar, cane, became, more, accessible, to, the, western, world, treatment, consisted, mainly, of, herbal, remedies, and, charms, but, sometimes, also, included, bloodletting, the, barber, surgeons, of, the, time, provided, services, that, included, tooth, extractions, learning, their, training, from, apprenticeships, these, health, providers, were, quite, successful, in, ending, tooth, pain, and, likely, prevented, systemic, spread, of, infections, in, many, cases, among, roman, catholics, prayers, to, saint, apollonia, the, patroness, of, dentistry, were, meant, to, heal, pain, derived, from, tooth, infection, there, is, also, evidence, of, caries, increase, when, indigenous, people, in, north, america, changed, from, a, strictly, hunter, gatherer, diet, to, a, diet, with, maize, rates, also, increased, after, contact, with, colonizing, europeans, implying, an, even, greater, dependence, on, maize, during, the, european, age, of, enlightenment, the, belief, that, a, tooth, worm, caused, caries, was, also, no, longer, accepted, in, the, european, medical, community, pierre, fauchard, known, as, the, father, of, modern, dentistry, was, one, of, the, first, to, reject, the, idea, that, worms, caused, tooth, decay, and, noted, that, sugar, was, detrimental, to, the, teeth, and, gingiva, in, 1850, another, sharp, increase, in, the, prevalence, of, caries, occurred, and, is, believed, to, be, a, result, of, widespread, diet, changes, prior, to, this, time, cervical, caries, was, the, most, frequent, type, of, caries, but, increased, availability, of, sugar, cane, refined, flour, bread, and, sweetened, tea, corresponded, with, a, greater, number, of, pit, and, fissure, caries, in, the, 1890s, w, d, miller, conducted, a, series, of, studies, that, led, him, to, propose, an, explanation, for, dental, caries, that, was, influential, for, current, theories, he, found, that, bacteria, inhabited, the, mouth, and, that, they, produced, acids, that, dissolved, tooth, structures, when, in, the, presence, of, fermentable, carbohydrates, this, explanation, is, known, as, the, chemoparasitic, caries, theory, miller, s, contribution, along, with, the, research, on, plaque, by, g, v, black, and, j, l, williams, served, as, the, foundation, for, the, current, explanation, of, the, etiology, of, caries, several, of, the, specific, strains, of, lactobacilli, were, identified, in, 1921, by, fernando, e, rodr, guez, vargas, in, 1924, in, london, killian, clarke, described, a, spherical, bacterium, in, chains, isolated, from, carious, lesions, which, he, called, streptococcus, mutans, although, clarke, proposed, that, this, organism, was, the, cause, of, caries, the, discovery, was, not, followed, up, later, in, 1954, in, the, us, frank, orland, working, with, hamsters, showed, that, caries, was, transmissible, and, caused, by, acid, producing, streptococcus, thus, ending, the, debate, whether, dental, caries, were, resultant, from, bacteria, it, was, not, until, the, late, 1960s, that, it, became, generally, accepted, that, the, streptococcus, isolated, from, hamster, caries, was, the, same, as, s, mutans, tooth, decay, has, been, present, throughout, human, history, from, early, hominids, millions, of, years, ago, to, modern, humans, the, prevalence, of, caries, increased, dramatically, in, the, 19th, century, as, the, industrial, revolution, made, certain, items, such, as, refined, sugar, and, flour, readily, available, the, diet, of, the, newly, industrialized, english, working, class, then, became, centered, on, bread, jam, and, sweetened, tea, greatly, increasing, both, sugar, consumption, and, caries, naturalized, from, latin, into, english, a, loanword, caries, in, its, english, form, originated, as, a, mass, noun, that, means, rottenness, that, is, decay, the, word, is, an, uncountable, noun, cariesology, or, cariology, is, the, study, of, dental, caries, it, is, estimated, that, untreated, dental, caries, results, in, worldwide, productivity, losses, in, the, size, of, about, us, 27, billion, yearly, dental, caries, are, uncommon, among, companion, animals
