seabirds, also, known, as, marine, birds, are, birds, that, are, adapted, to, life, within, the, marine, environment, while, seabirds, vary, greatly, in, lifestyle, behaviour, and, physiology, they, often, exhibit, striking, convergent, evolution, as, the, same, environmental, problems, and, feeding, niches, have, resulted, in, similar, adaptations, the, first, seabirds, evolved, in, the, cretaceous, period, and, modern, seabird, families, emerged, in, the, paleogene, seabirds, generally, live, longer, breed, later, and, have, fewer, young, than, other, birds, but, they, invest, a, great, deal, of, time, in, their, young, most, species, nest, in, colonies, varying, in, size, from, a, few, dozen, birds, to, millions, many, species, are, famous, for, undertaking, long, annual, migrations, crossing, the, equator, or, circumnavigating, the, earth, in, some, cases, they, feed, both, at, the, ocean, s, surface, and, below, it, and, even, on, each, other, seabirds, can, be, highly, pelagic, coastal, or, in, some, cases, spend, a, part, of, the, year, away, from, the, sea, entirely, seabirds, and, humans, have, a, long, history, together, they, have, provided, food, to, hunters, guided, fishermen, to, fishing, stocks, and, led, sailors, to, land, many, species, are, currently, threatened, by, human, activities, such, as, oil, spills, nets, climate, change, and, severe, weather, conservation, efforts, include, the, establishment, of, wildlife, refuges, and, adjustments, to, fishing, techniques, there, exists, no, single, definition, of, which, groups, families, and, species, are, seabirds, and, most, definitions, are, in, some, way, arbitrary, elizabeth, shreiber, and, joanna, burger, two, seabird, scientists, said, the, one, common, characteristic, that, all, seabirds, share, is, that, they, feed, in, saltwater, but, as, seems, to, be, true, with, any, statement, in, biology, some, do, not, however, by, convention, all, of, the, sphenisciformes, penguins, and, procellariiformes, albatrosses, and, petrels, all, of, the, suliformes, gannets, and, cormorants, except, the, darters, and, some, of, the, charadriiformes, the, gulls, skuas, terns, auks, and, skimmers, are, classified, as, seabirds, the, phalaropes, are, usually, included, as, well, since, although, they, are, waders, shorebirds, in, north, america, two, of, the, three, species, red, and, red, necked, are, oceanic, for, nine, months, of, the, year, crossing, the, equator, to, feed, pelagically, loons, and, grebes, which, nest, on, lakes, but, winter, at, sea, are, usually, categorized, as, water, birds, not, seabirds, although, there, are, a, number, of, sea, ducks, in, the, family, anatidae, that, are, truly, marine, in, the, winter, by, convention, they, are, usually, excluded, from, the, seabird, grouping, many, waders, or, shorebirds, and, herons, are, also, highly, marine, living, on, the, sea, s, edge, coast, but, are, also, not, treated, as, seabirds, sea, eagles, and, other, fish, eating, birds, of, prey, are, also, typically, excluded, however, tied, to, marine, environments, they, may, be, german, ornithologist, gerald, mayr, defined, the, core, waterbird, clade, aequornithes, in, 2010, this, lineage, gives, rise, to, the, gaviiformes, sphenisciformes, procellariiformes, ciconiiformes, suliformes, and, pelecaniformes, the, tropicbirds, are, part, of, a, lineage, eurypygimorphae, that, is, a, sister, group, to, the, aequornithes, seabirds, by, virtue, of, living, in, a, geologically, depositional, environment, that, is, in, the, sea, where, sediments, are, readily, laid, down, are, well, represented, in, the, fossil, record, they, are, first, known, to, occur, in, the, cretaceous, period, the, earliest, being, the, hesperornithiformes, like, hesperornis, regalis, a, flightless, loon, like, seabird, that, could, dive, in, a, fashion, similar, to, grebes, and, loons, using, its, feet, to, move, underwater, but, had, a, beak, filled, with, sharp, teeth, flying, cretaceous, seabirds, do, not, exceed, wingspans, of, two, meters, any, sizes, were, taken, by, piscivorous, pterosaurs, while, hesperornis, is, not, thought, to, have, left, descendants, the, earliest, modern, seabirds, also, occurred, in, the, cretaceous, with, a, species, called, tytthostonyx, glauconiticus, which, has, features, suggestive, of, procellariiformes, and, fregatidae, as, a, clade, the, aequornithes, either, became, seabirds, in, a, single, transition, in, the, cretaceous, or, some, lineages, such, as, pelicans, and, frigatebirds, adapted, to, sea, living, independently, from, freshwater, dwelling, ancestors, in, the, paleogene, both, pterosaurs, and, marine, reptiles, became, extinct, allowing, seabirds, to, expand, ecologically, these, post, extinction, seas, were, dominated, by, early, procellariidae, giant, penguins, and, two, extinct, families, the, pelagornithidae, and, the, plotopteridae, a, group, of, large, seabirds, that, looked, like, the, penguins, modern, genera, began, their, wide, radiation, in, the, miocene, although, the, genus, puffinus, which, includes, today, s, manx, shearwater, and, sooty, shearwater, might, date, back, to, the, oligocene, within, the, charadriiformes, the, gulls, and, allies, lari, became, seabirds, in, the, late, eocene, and, then, waders, in, the, middle, miocene, langhian, the, highest, diversity, of, seabirds, apparently, existed, during, the, late, miocene, and, the, pliocene, at, the, end, of, the, latter, the, oceanic, food, web, had, undergone, a, period, of, upheaval, due, to, extinction, of, considerable, numbers, of, marine, species, subsequently, the, spread, of, marine, mammals, seems, to, have, prevented, seabirds, from, reaching, their, erstwhile, diversity, seabirds, have, made, numerous, adaptations, to, living, on, and, feeding, in, the, sea, wing, morphology, has, been, shaped, by, the, niche, an, individual, species, or, family, has, evolved, so, that, looking, at, a, wing, s, shape, and, loading, can, tell, a, scientist, about, its, life, feeding, behaviour, longer, wings, and, low, wing, loading, are, typical, of, more, pelagic, species, while, diving, species, have, shorter, wings, species, such, as, the, wandering, albatross, which, forage, over, huge, areas, of, sea, have, a, reduced, capacity, for, powered, flight, and, are, dependent, on, a, type, of, gliding, called, dynamic, soaring, where, the, wind, deflected, by, waves, provides, lift, as, well, as, slope, soaring, seabirds, also, almost, always, have, webbed, feet, to, aid, movement, on, the, surface, as, well, as, assisting, diving, in, some, species, the, procellariiformes, are, unusual, among, birds, in, having, a, strong, sense, of, smell, which, is, used, to, find, widely, distributed, food, in, a, vast, ocean, and, help, distinguish, familiar, nest, odours, from, unfamiliar, ones, salt, glands, are, used, by, seabirds, to, deal, with, the, salt, they, ingest, by, drinking, and, feeding, particularly, on, crustaceans, and, to, help, them, osmoregulate, the, excretions, from, these, glands, which, are, positioned, in, the, head, of, the, birds, emerging, from, the, nasal, cavity, are, almost, pure, sodium, chloride, with, the, exception, of, the, cormorants, and, some, terns, and, in, common, with, most, other, birds, all, seabirds, have, waterproof, plumage, however, compared, to, land, birds, they, have, far, more, feathers, protecting, their, bodies, this, dense, plumage, is, better, able, to, protect, the, bird, from, getting, wet, and, cold, is, kept, out, by, a, dense, layer, of, down, feathers, the, cormorants, possess, a, layer, of, unique, feathers, that, retain, a, smaller, layer, of, air, compared, to, other, diving, birds, but, otherwise, soak, up, water, this, allows, them, to, swim, without, fighting, the, buoyancy, that, retaining, air, in, the, feathers, causes, yet, retain, enough, air, to, prevent, the, bird, losing, excessive, heat, through, contact, with, water, the, plumage, of, most, seabirds, is, less, colourful, than, that, of, land, birds, restricted, in, the, main, to, variations, of, black, white, or, grey, a, few, species, sport, colourful, plumes, such, as, the, tropicbirds, and, some, penguins, but, most, of, the, colour, in, seabirds, appears, in, the, bills, and, legs, the, plumage, of, seabirds, is, thought, in, many, cases, to, be, for, camouflage, both, defensive, the, colour, of, us, navy, battleships, is, the, same, as, that, of, antarctic, prions, and, in, both, cases, it, reduces, visibility, at, sea, and, aggressive, the, white, underside, possessed, by, many, seabirds, helps, hide, them, from, prey, below, the, usually, black, wing, tips, help, prevent, wear, as, they, contain, melanins, to, make, them, black, that, helps, the, feathers, resist, abrasion, seabirds, evolved, to, exploit, different, food, resources, in, the, world, s, seas, and, oceans, and, to, a, great, extent, their, physiology, and, behaviour, have, been, shaped, by, their, diet, these, evolutionary, forces, have, often, caused, species, in, different, families, and, even, orders, to, evolve, similar, strategies, and, adaptations, to, the, same, problems, leading, to, remarkable, convergent, evolution, such, as, that, between, auks, and, penguins, there, are, four, basic, feeding, strategies, or, ecological, guilds, for, feeding, at, sea, surface, feeding, pursuit, diving, plunge, diving, and, predation, of, higher, vertebrates, within, these, guilds, there, are, multiple, variations, on, the, theme, many, seabirds, feed, on, the, ocean, s, surface, as, the, action, of, marine, currents, often, concentrates, food, such, as, krill, forage, fish, squid, or, other, prey, items, within, reach, of, a, dipped, head, surface, feeding, itself, can, be, broken, up, into, two, different, approaches, surface, feeding, while, flying, for, example, as, practiced, by, gadfly, petrels, frigatebirds, and, storm, petrels, and, surface, feeding, while, swimming, examples, of, which, are, practiced, by, gulls, fulmars, many, of, the, shearwaters, and, gadfly, petrels, surface, feeders, in, flight, include, some, of, the, most, acrobatic, of, seabirds, which, either, snatch, morsels, from, the, water, as, do, frigate, birds, and, some, terns, or, walk, pattering, and, hovering, on, the, water, s, surface, as, some, of, the, storm, petrels, do, many, of, these, do, not, ever, land, in, the, water, and, some, such, as, the, frigatebirds, have, difficulty, getting, airborne, again, should, they, do, so, another, seabird, family, that, does, not, land, while, feeding, is, the, skimmer, which, has, a, unique, fishing, method, flying, along, the, surface, with, the, lower, mandible, in, the, water, this, shuts, automatically, when, the, bill, touches, something, in, the, water, the, skimmer, s, bill, reflects, its, unusual, lifestyle, with, the, lower, mandible, uniquely, being, longer, than, the, upper, one, surface, feeders, that, swim, often, have, unique, bills, as, well, adapted, for, their, specific, prey, prions, have, special, bills, with, filters, called, lamellae, to, filter, out, plankton, from, mouthfuls, of, water, and, many, albatrosses, and, petrels, have, hooked, bills, to, snatch, fast, moving, prey, on, the, other, hand, most, gulls, are, versatile, and, opportunistic, feeders, who, will, eat, a, wide, variety, of, prey, both, at, sea, and, on, land, pursuit, diving, exerts, greater, pressures, both, evolutionary, and, physiological, on, seabirds, but, the, reward, is, a, greater, area, in, which, to, feed, than, is, available, to, surface, feeders, underwater, propulsion, is, provided, by, wings, as, used, by, penguins, auks, diving, petrels, and, some, other, species, of, petrel, or, feet, as, used, by, cormorants, grebes, loons, and, several, types, of, fish, eating, ducks, wing, propelled, divers, are, generally, faster, than, foot, propelled, divers, the, use, of, wings, or, feet, for, diving, has, limited, their, utility, in, other, situations, loons, and, grebes, walk, with, extreme, difficulty, if, at, all, penguins, cannot, fly, and, auks, have, sacrificed, flight, efficiency, in, favour, of, diving, for, example, the, razorbill, an, atlantic, auk, requires, 64, more, energy, to, fly, than, a, petrel, of, equivalent, size, many, shearwaters, are, intermediate, between, the, two, having, longer, wings, than, typical, wing, propelled, divers, but, heavier, wing, loadings, than, the, other, surface, feeding, procellariids, leaving, them, capable, of, diving, to, considerable, depths, while, still, being, efficient, long, distance, travellers, the, short, tailed, shearwater, is, the, deepest, diver, of, the, shearwaters, having, been, recorded, diving, below, 70, metres, 230, ft, some, albatross, species, are, also, capable, of, limited, diving, with, light, mantled, sooty, albatrosses, holding, the, record, at, 12, metres, 40, ft, of, all, the, wing, propelled, pursuit, divers, the, most, efficient, in, the, air, are, the, albatrosses, and, they, are, also, the, poorest, divers, this, is, the, dominant, guild, in, polar, and, subpolar, environments, but, it, is, energetically, inefficient, in, warmer, waters, with, their, poor, flying, ability, many, wing, propelled, pursuit, divers, are, more, limited, in, their, foraging, range, than, other, guilds, gannets, boobies, tropicbirds, some, terns, and, brown, pelicans, all, engage, in, plunge, diving, taking, fast, moving, prey, by, diving, into, the, water, from, the, flight, plunge, diving, allows, birds, to, use, the, energy, from, the, momentum, of, the, dive, to, combat, natural, buoyancy, caused, by, air, trapped, in, plumage, and, thus, uses, less, energy, than, the, dedicated, pursuit, divers, allowing, them, to, utilise, more, widely, distributed, food, resources, for, example, in, impoverished, tropical, seas, in, general, this, is, the, most, specialised, method, of, hunting, employed, by, seabirds, other, non, specialists, such, as, gulls, and, skuas, may, employ, it, but, do, so, with, less, skill, and, from, lower, heights, in, brown, pelicans, the, skills, of, plunge, diving, take, several, years, to, fully, develop, once, mature, they, can, dive, from, 20, m, 66, ft, above, the, water, s, surface, shifting, the, body, before, impact, to, avoid, injury, it, may, be, that, plunge, divers, are, restricted, in, their, hunting, grounds, to, clear, waters, that, afford, a, view, of, their, prey, from, the, air, while, they, are, the, dominant, guild, in, the, tropics, the, link, between, plunge, diving, and, water, clarity, is, inconclusive, some, plunge, divers, as, well, as, some, surface, feeders, are, dependent, on, dolphins, and, tuna, to, push, shoaling, fish, up, towards, the, surface, this, catch, all, category, refers, to, other, seabird, strategies, that, involve, the, next, trophic, level, up, kleptoparasites, are, seabirds, that, make, a, part, of, their, living, stealing, food, of, other, seabirds, most, famously, frigatebirds, and, skuas, engage, in, this, behaviour, although, gulls, terns, and, other, species, will, steal, food, opportunistically, the, nocturnal, nesting, behaviour, of, some, seabirds, has, been, interpreted, as, arising, due, to, pressure, from, this, aerial, piracy, kleptoparasitism, is, not, thought, to, play, a, significant, part, of, the, diet, of, any, species, and, is, instead, a, supplement, to, food, obtained, by, hunting, a, study, of, great, frigatebirds, stealing, from, masked, boobies, estimated, that, the, frigatebirds, could, at, most, obtain, 40, of, the, food, they, needed, and, on, average, obtained, only, 5, many, species, of, gull, will, feed, on, seabird, and, sea, mammal, carrion, when, the, opportunity, arises, as, will, giant, petrels, some, species, of, albatross, also, engage, in, scavenging, an, analysis, of, regurgitated, squid, beaks, has, shown, that, many, of, the, squid, eaten, are, too, large, to, have, been, caught, alive, and, include, mid, water, species, likely, to, be, beyond, the, reach, of, albatrosses, some, species, will, also, feed, on, other, seabirds, for, example, gulls, skuas, and, pelicans, will, often, take, eggs, chicks, and, even, small, adult, seabirds, from, nesting, colonies, while, the, giant, petrels, can, kill, prey, up, to, the, size, of, small, penguins, and, seal, pups, seabirds, life, histories, are, dramatically, different, from, those, of, land, birds, in, general, they, are, k, selected, live, much, longer, anywhere, between, twenty, and, sixty, years, delay, breeding, for, longer, for, up, to, ten, years, and, invest, more, effort, into, fewer, young, most, species, will, only, have, one, clutch, a, year, unless, they, lose, the, first, with, a, few, exceptions, like, the, cassin, s, auklet, and, many, species, like, the, tubenoses, and, sulids, will, only, lay, one, egg, a, year, care, of, young, is, protracted, extending, for, as, long, as, six, months, among, the, longest, for, birds, for, example, once, common, guillemot, chicks, fledge, they, remain, with, the, male, parent, for, several, months, at, sea, the, frigatebirds, have, the, longest, period, of, parental, care, of, any, bird, except, a, few, raptors, and, the, southern, ground, hornbill, with, each, chick, fledging, after, four, to, six, months, and, continued, assistance, after, that, for, up, to, fourteen, months, due, to, the, extended, period, of, care, breeding, occurs, every, two, years, rather, than, annually, for, some, species, this, life, history, strategy, has, probably, evolved, both, in, response, to, the, challenges, of, living, at, sea, collecting, widely, scattered, prey, items, the, frequency, of, breeding, failures, due, to, unfavourable, marine, conditions, and, the, relative, lack, of, predation, compared, to, that, of, land, living, birds, because, of, the, greater, investment, in, raising, the, young, and, because, foraging, for, food, may, occur, far, from, the, nest, site, in, all, seabird, species, except, the, phalaropes, both, parents, participate, in, caring, for, the, young, and, pairs, are, typically, at, least, seasonally, monogamous, many, species, such, as, gulls, auks, and, penguins, retain, the, same, mate, for, several, seasons, and, many, petrel, species, mate, for, life, albatrosses, and, procellariids, which, mate, for, life, take, many, years, to, form, a, pair, bond, before, they, breed, and, the, albatrosses, have, an, elaborate, breeding, dance, that, is, part, of, pair, bond, formation, ninety, five, percent, of, seabirds, are, colonial, and, seabird, colonies, are, among, the, largest, bird, colonies, in, the, world, providing, one, of, earth, s, great, wildlife, spectacles, colonies, of, over, a, million, birds, have, been, recorded, both, in, the, tropics, such, as, kiritimati, in, the, pacific, and, in, the, polar, latitudes, as, in, antarctica, seabird, colonies, occur, exclusively, for, the, purpose, of, breeding, non, breeding, birds, will, only, collect, together, outside, the, breeding, season, in, areas, where, prey, species, are, densely, aggregated, seabird, colonies, are, highly, variable, individual, nesting, sites, can, be, widely, spaced, as, in, an, albatross, colony, or, densely, packed, as, with, a, murre, colony, in, most, seabird, colonies, several, different, species, will, nest, on, the, same, colony, often, exhibiting, some, niche, separation, seabirds, can, nest, in, trees, if, any, are, available, on, the, ground, with, or, without, nests, on, cliffs, in, burrows, under, the, ground, and, in, rocky, crevices, competition, can, be, strong, both, within, species, and, between, species, with, aggressive, species, such, as, sooty, terns, pushing, less, dominant, species, out, of, the, most, desirable, nesting, spaces, the, tropical, bonin, petrel, nests, during, the, winter, to, avoid, competition, with, the, more, aggressive, wedge, tailed, shearwater, when, the, seasons, overlap, the, wedge, tailed, shearwaters, will, kill, young, bonin, petrels, in, order, to, use, their, burrows, many, seabirds, show, remarkable, site, fidelity, returning, to, the, same, burrow, nest, or, site, for, many, years, and, they, will, defend, that, site, from, rivals, with, great, vigour, this, increases, breeding, success, provides, a, place, for, returning, mates, to, reunite, and, reduces, the, costs, of, prospecting, for, a, new, site, young, adults, breeding, for, the, first, time, usually, return, to, their, natal, colony, and, often, nest, close, to, where, they, hatched, this, tendency, known, as, philopatry, is, so, strong, that, a, study, of, laysan, albatrosses, found, that, the, average, distance, between, hatching, site, and, the, site, where, a, bird, established, its, own, territory, was, 22, metres, 72, ft, another, study, this, time, on, cory, s, shearwaters, nesting, near, corsica, found, that, of, nine, out, of, 61, male, chicks, that, returned, to, breed, at, their, natal, colony, bred, in, the, burrow, they, were, raised, in, and, two, actually, bred, with, their, own, mother, colonies, are, usually, situated, on, islands, cliffs, or, headlands, which, land, mammals, have, difficulty, accessing, this, is, thought, to, provide, protection, to, seabirds, which, are, often, very, clumsy, on, land, coloniality, often, arises, in, types, of, bird, that, do, not, defend, feeding, territories, such, as, swifts, which, have, a, very, variable, prey, source, this, may, be, a, reason, why, it, arises, more, frequently, in, seabirds, there, are, other, possible, advantages, colonies, may, act, as, information, centres, where, seabirds, returning, to, the, sea, to, forage, can, find, out, where, prey, is, by, studying, returning, individuals, of, the, same, species, there, are, disadvantages, to, colonial, life, particularly, the, spread, of, disease, colonies, also, attract, the, attention, of, predators, principally, other, birds, and, many, species, attend, their, colonies, nocturnally, to, avoid, predation, birds, from, different, colonies, often, forage, in, different, areas, to, avoid, competition, like, many, birds, seabirds, often, migrate, after, the, breeding, season, of, these, the, trip, taken, by, the, arctic, tern, is, the, farthest, of, any, bird, crossing, the, equator, in, order, to, spend, the, austral, summer, in, antarctica, other, species, also, undertake, trans, equatorial, trips, both, from, the, north, to, the, south, and, from, south, to, north, the, population, of, elegant, terns, which, nest, off, baja, california, splits, after, the, breeding, season, with, some, birds, travelling, north, to, the, central, coast, of, california, and, some, travelling, as, far, south, as, peru, and, chile, to, feed, in, the, humboldt, current, the, sooty, shearwater, undertakes, an, annual, migration, cycle, that, rivals, that, of, the, arctic, tern, birds, that, nest, in, new, zealand, and, chile, and, spend, the, northern, summer, feeding, in, the, north, pacific, off, japan, alaska, and, california, an, annual, round, trip, of, 64, 000, kilometres, 40, 000, mi, other, species, also, migrate, shorter, distances, away, from, the, breeding, sites, their, distribution, at, sea, determined, by, the, availability, of, food, if, oceanic, conditions, are, unsuitable, seabirds, will, emigrate, to, more, productive, areas, sometimes, permanently, if, the, bird, is, young, after, fledging, juvenile, birds, often, disperse, further, than, adults, and, to, different, areas, so, are, commonly, sighted, far, from, a, species, normal, range, some, species, such, as, the, auks, do, not, have, a, concerted, migration, effort, but, drift, southwards, as, the, winter, approaches, other, species, such, as, some, of, the, storm, petrels, diving, petrels, and, cormorants, never, disperse, at, all, staying, near, their, breeding, colonies, year, round, while, the, definition, of, seabirds, suggests, that, the, birds, in, question, spend, their, lives, on, the, ocean, many, seabird, families, have, many, species, that, spend, some, or, even, most, of, their, lives, inland, away, from, the, sea, most, strikingly, many, species, breed, tens, hundreds, or, even, thousands, of, miles, inland, some, of, these, species, still, return, to, the, ocean, to, feed, for, example, the, snow, petrel, the, nests, of, which, have, been, found, 480, kilometres, 300, mi, inland, on, the, antarctic, mainland, are, unlikely, to, find, anything, to, eat, around, their, breeding, sites, the, marbled, murrelet, nests, inland, in, old, growth, forest, seeking, huge, conifers, with, large, branches, to, nest, on, other, species, such, as, the, california, gull, nest, and, feed, inland, on, lakes, and, then, move, to, the, coasts, in, the, winter, some, cormorant, pelican, gull, and, tern, species, have, individuals, that, never, visit, the, sea, at, all, spending, their, lives, on, lakes, rivers, swamps, and, in, the, case, of, some, of, the, gulls, cities, and, agricultural, land, in, these, cases, it, is, thought, that, these, terrestrial, or, freshwater, birds, evolved, from, marine, ancestors, some, seabirds, principally, those, that, nest, in, tundra, as, skuas, and, phalaropes, do, will, migrate, over, land, as, well, the, more, marine, species, such, as, petrels, auks, and, gannets, are, more, restricted, in, their, habits, but, are, occasionally, seen, inland, as, vagrants, this, most, commonly, happens, to, young, inexperienced, birds, but, can, happen, in, great, numbers, to, exhausted, adults, after, large, storms, an, event, known, as, a, wreck, seabirds, have, had, a, long, association, with, both, fisheries, and, sailors, and, both, have, drawn, benefits, and, disadvantages, from, the, relationship, fishermen, have, traditionally, used, seabirds, as, indicators, of, both, fish, shoals, underwater, banks, that, might, indicate, fish, stocks, and, of, potential, landfall, in, fact, the, known, association, of, seabirds, with, land, was, instrumental, in, allowing, the, polynesians, to, locate, tiny, landmasses, in, the, pacific, seabirds, have, provided, food, for, fishermen, away, from, home, as, well, as, bait, famously, tethered, cormorants, have, been, used, to, catch, fish, directly, indirectly, fisheries, have, also, benefited, from, guano, from, colonies, of, seabirds, acting, as, fertilizer, for, the, surrounding, seas, negative, effects, on, fisheries, are, mostly, restricted, to, raiding, by, birds, on, aquaculture, although, long, lining, fisheries, also, have, to, deal, with, bait, stealing, there, have, been, claims, of, prey, depletion, by, seabirds, of, fishery, stocks, and, while, there, is, some, evidence, of, this, the, effects, of, seabirds, are, considered, smaller, than, that, of, marine, mammals, and, predatory, fish, like, tuna, some, seabird, species, have, benefited, from, fisheries, particularly, from, discarded, fish, and, offal, these, discards, compose, 30, of, the, food, of, seabirds, in, the, north, sea, for, example, and, compose, up, to, 70, of, the, total, food, of, some, seabird, populations, this, can, have, other, impacts, for, example, the, spread, of, the, northern, fulmar, through, the, united, kingdom, is, attributed, in, part, to, the, availability, of, discards, discards, generally, benefit, surface, feeders, such, as, gannets, and, petrels, to, the, detriment, of, pursuit, divers, like, penguins, and, guillemots, which, can, get, entangled, in, the, nets, fisheries, also, have, negative, effects, on, seabirds, and, these, effects, particularly, on, the, long, lived, and, slow, breeding, albatrosses, are, a, source, of, increasing, concern, to, conservationists, the, bycatch, of, seabirds, entangled, in, nets, or, hooked, on, fishing, lines, has, had, a, big, impact, on, seabird, numbers, for, example, an, estimated, 100, 000, albatrosses, are, hooked, and, drown, each, year, on, tuna, lines, set, out, by, long, line, fisheries, overall, many, hundreds, of, thousands, of, birds, are, trapped, and, killed, each, year, a, source, of, concern, for, some, of, the, rarest, species, for, example, only, about, 2, 000, short, tailed, albatrosses, are, known, to, still, exist, seabirds, are, also, thought, to, suffer, when, overfishing, occurs, changes, to, the, marine, ecosystems, caused, by, dredging, which, alters, the, biodiversity, of, the, seafloor, can, also, have, a, negative, impact, the, hunting, of, seabirds, and, the, collecting, of, seabird, eggs, have, contributed, to, the, declines, of, many, species, and, the, extinction, of, several, including, the, great, auk, and, the, spectacled, cormorant, seabirds, have, been, hunted, for, food, by, coastal, peoples, throughout, history, one, of, the, earliest, instances, known, is, in, southern, chile, where, archaeological, excavations, in, middens, has, shown, hunting, of, albatrosses, cormorants, and, shearwaters, from, 5000, bp, this, pressure, has, led, to, some, species, becoming, extinct, in, many, places, in, particular, at, least, 20, species, of, an, original, 29, no, longer, breed, on, easter, island, in, the, 19th, century, the, hunting, of, seabirds, for, fat, deposits, and, feathers, for, the, millinery, trade, reached, industrial, levels, muttonbirding, harvesting, shearwater, chicks, developed, as, important, industries, in, both, new, zealand, and, tasmania, and, the, name, of, one, species, the, providence, petrel, is, derived, from, its, seemingly, miraculous, arrival, on, norfolk, island, where, it, provided, a, windfall, for, starving, european, settlers, in, the, falkland, islands, hundreds, of, thousands, of, penguins, were, harvested, for, their, oil, each, year, seabird, eggs, have, also, long, been, an, important, source, of, food, for, sailors, undertaking, long, sea, voyages, as, well, as, being, taken, when, settlements, grow, in, areas, near, a, colony, eggers, from, san, francisco, took, almost, half, a, million, eggs, a, year, from, the, farallon, islands, in, the, mid, 19th, century, a, period, in, the, islands, history, from, which, the, seabird, species, are, still, recovering, both, hunting, and, egging, continue, today, although, not, at, the, levels, that, occurred, in, the, past, and, generally, in, a, more, controlled, manner, for, example, the, m, ori, of, stewart, island, rakiura, continue, to, harvest, the, chicks, of, the, sooty, shearwater, as, they, have, done, for, centuries, using, traditional, stewardship, kaitiakitanga, to, manage, the, harvest, but, now, also, work, with, the, university, of, otago, in, studying, the, populations, in, greenland, however, uncontrolled, hunting, is, pushing, many, species, into, steep, decline, other, human, factors, have, led, to, declines, and, even, extinctions, in, seabird, populations, and, species, of, these, perhaps, the, most, serious, are, introduced, species, seabirds, breeding, predominantly, on, small, isolated, islands, are, vulnerable, to, predators, because, they, have, lost, many, behaviours, associated, with, defence, from, predators, feral, cats, can, take, seabirds, as, large, as, albatrosses, and, many, introduced, rodents, such, as, the, pacific, rat, take, eggs, hidden, in, burrows, introduced, goats, cattle, rabbits, and, other, herbivores, can, create, problems, particularly, when, species, need, vegetation, to, protect, or, shade, their, young, the, disturbance, of, breeding, colonies, by, humans, is, often, a, problem, as, well, visitors, even, well, meaning, tourists, can, flush, brooding, adults, off, a, colony, leaving, chicks, and, eggs, vulnerable, to, predators, the, build, up, of, toxins, and, pollutants, in, seabirds, is, also, a, concern, seabirds, being, apex, predators, suffered, from, the, ravages, of, the, insecticide, ddt, until, it, was, banned, ddt, was, implicated, for, example, in, embryo, development, problems, and, the, skewed, sex, ratio, of, western, gulls, in, southern, california, oil, spills, are, also, a, threat, to, seabirds, the, oil, is, toxic, and, bird, feathers, become, saturated, by, the, oil, causing, them, to, lose, their, waterproofing, oil, pollution, in, particular, threatens, species, with, restricted, ranges, or, already, depressed, populations, climate, change, mainly, affect, seabirds, via, changes, to, their, habitat, various, processes, in, the, ocean, lead, to, decreased, availability, of, food, and, colonies, are, more, often, flooded, as, a, consequence, of, sea, level, rise, and, extreme, rainfall, events, heat, stress, from, extreme, temperatures, is, an, additional, threat, some, seabirds, have, used, changing, wind, patterns, to, forage, further, and, more, efficiently, in, 2023, plasticosis, a, new, disease, caused, solely, by, plastics, was, discovered, in, seabirds, the, birds, identified, as, having, the, disease, have, scarred, digestive, tracts, from, ingesting, plastic, waste, when, birds, ingest, small, pieces, of, plastic, they, found, it, inflames, the, digestive, tract, over, time, the, persistent, inflammation, causes, tissues, to, become, scarred, and, disfigured, affecting, digestion, growth, and, survival, the, threats, faced, by, seabirds, have, not, gone, unnoticed, by, scientists, or, the, conservation, movement, as, early, as, 1903, u, s, president, theodore, roosevelt, was, convinced, of, the, need, to, declare, pelican, island, in, florida, a, national, wildlife, refuge, to, protect, the, bird, colonies, including, the, nesting, brown, pelicans, and, in, 1909, he, protected, the, farallon, islands, today, many, important, seabird, colonies, are, given, some, measure, of, protection, from, heron, island, in, australia, to, triangle, island, in, british, columbia, island, restoration, techniques, pioneered, by, new, zealand, enable, the, removal, of, exotic, invaders, from, increasingly, large, islands, feral, cats, have, been, removed, from, ascension, island, arctic, foxes, from, many, islands, in, the, aleutian, islands, and, rats, from, campbell, island, the, removal, of, these, introduced, species, has, led, to, increases, in, numbers, of, species, under, pressure, and, even, the, return, of, extirpated, ones, after, the, removal, of, cats, from, ascension, island, seabirds, began, to, nest, there, again, for, the, first, time, in, over, a, hundred, years, seabird, mortality, caused, by, long, line, fisheries, can, be, greatly, reduced, by, techniques, such, as, setting, long, line, bait, at, night, dying, the, bait, blue, setting, the, bait, underwater, increasing, the, amount, of, weight, on, lines, and, by, using, bird, scarers, and, their, deployment, is, increasingly, required, by, many, national, fishing, fleets, one, of, the, millennium, projects, in, the, uk, was, the, scottish, seabird, centre, near, the, important, bird, sanctuaries, on, bass, rock, fidra, and, the, surrounding, islands, the, area, is, home, to, huge, colonies, of, gannets, puffins, skuas, and, other, seabirds, the, centre, allows, visitors, to, watch, live, video, from, the, islands, as, well, as, learn, about, the, threats, the, birds, face, and, how, we, can, protect, them, and, has, helped, to, significantly, raise, the, profile, of, seabird, conservation, in, the, uk, seabird, tourism, can, provide, income, for, coastal, communities, as, well, as, raise, the, profile, of, seabird, conservation, although, it, needs, to, be, managed, to, ensure, it, does, not, harm, the, colonies, and, nesting, birds, for, example, the, northern, royal, albatross, colony, at, taiaroa, head, in, new, zealand, attracts, 40, 000, visitors, a, year, the, plight, of, albatross, and, large, seabirds, as, well, as, other, marine, creatures, being, taken, as, bycatch, by, long, line, fisheries, has, been, addressed, by, a, large, number, of, non, governmental, organizations, including, birdlife, international, the, american, bird, conservancy, and, the, royal, society, for, the, protection, of, birds, this, led, to, the, agreement, on, the, conservation, of, albatrosses, and, petrels, a, legally, binding, treaty, designed, to, protect, these, threatened, species, which, has, been, ratified, by, thirteen, countries, as, of, 2021, argentina, australia, brazil, chile, ecuador, france, new, zealand, norway, peru, south, africa, spain, uruguay, united, kingdom, many, seabirds, are, little, studied, and, poorly, known, because, they, live, far, out, at, sea, and, breed, in, isolated, colonies, some, seabirds, particularly, the, albatrosses, and, gulls, are, more, well, known, to, humans, the, albatross, has, been, described, as, the, most, legendary, of, birds, and, have, a, variety, of, myths, and, legends, associated, with, them, while, it, is, widely, considered, unlucky, to, harm, them, the, notion, that, sailors, believed, that, is, a, myth, that, derives, from, samuel, taylor, coleridge, s, famous, poem, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, in, which, a, sailor, is, punished, for, killing, an, albatross, by, having, to, wear, its, corpse, around, his, neck, sailors, did, however, consider, it, unlucky, to, touch, a, storm, petrel, especially, one, that, landed, on, the, ship, gulls, are, one, of, the, most, commonly, seen, seabirds, because, they, frequent, human, made, habitats, such, as, cities, and, dumps, and, often, show, a, fearless, nature, gulls, have, been, used, as, metaphors, as, in, jonathan, livingston, seagull, by, richard, bach, or, to, denote, a, closeness, to, the, sea, in, the, lord, of, the, rings, they, appear, in, the, insignia, of, gondor, and, therefore, n, menor, used, in, the, design, of, the, films, and, they, call, legolas, to, and, across, the, sea, pelicans, have, long, been, associated, with, mercy, and, altruism, because, of, an, early, christian, myth, that, they, split, open, their, breast, to, feed, their, starving, chicks, the, following, are, the, groups, of, birds, normally, classed, as, seabirds, sphenisciformes, antarctic, and, southern, waters, 16, species,
