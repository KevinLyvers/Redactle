see, text, hornets, insects, in, the, genus, vespa, are, the, largest, of, the, eusocial, wasps, and, are, similar, in, appearance, to, yellowjackets, their, close, relatives, some, species, can, reach, up, to, 5, 5, cm, 2, 2, in, in, length, they, are, distinguished, from, other, vespine, wasps, by, the, relatively, large, top, margin, of, the, head, worldwide, 22, species, of, vespa, are, recognized, most, species, only, occur, in, the, tropics, of, asia, though, the, european, hornet, v, crabro, is, widely, distributed, throughout, europe, russia, north, america, and, north, eastern, asia, wasps, native, to, north, america, in, the, genus, dolichovespula, are, commonly, referred, to, as, hornets, e, g, baldfaced, hornets, but, all, of, them, are, actually, yellowjackets, like, other, social, wasps, hornets, build, communal, nests, by, chewing, wood, to, make, a, papery, pulp, each, nest, has, one, queen, which, lays, eggs, and, is, attended, by, workers, that, while, genetically, female, cannot, lay, fertile, eggs, most, species, make, exposed, nests, in, trees, and, shrubs, but, some, such, as, vespa, orientalis, build, their, nests, underground, or, in, other, cavities, in, the, tropics, these, nests, may, last, year, round, but, in, temperate, areas, the, nest, dies, over, the, winter, with, lone, queens, hibernating, in, leaf, litter, or, other, insulative, material, until, the, spring, male, hornets, are, docile, and, do, not, have, stingers, hornets, are, often, considered, pests, as, they, aggressively, guard, their, nesting, sites, when, threatened, and, their, stings, can, be, more, dangerous, than, those, of, bees, while, taxonomically, well, defined, some, confusion, may, remain, about, the, differences, between, hornets, and, other, wasps, of, the, family, vespidae, specifically, the, yellowjackets, which, are, members, of, the, same, subfamily, also, a, related, genus, of, asian, nocturnal, vespines, provespa, is, referred, to, as, night, wasps, or, night, hornets, though, they, are, not, true, hornets, some, other, large, wasps, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, hornets, most, notably, the, bald, faced, hornet, dolichovespula, maculata, found, in, north, america, it, is, set, apart, by, its, black, and, ivory, coloration, the, name, hornet, is, used, for, this, species, primarily, because, of, its, habit, of, making, aerial, nests, similar, to, some, of, the, true, hornets, rather, than, subterranean, nests, another, example, is, the, australian, hornet, abispa, ephippium, which, is, actually, a, species, of, potter, wasp, hornets, are, found, mainly, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, european, hornet, v, crabro, is, the, best, known, species, widely, distributed, in, europe, but, is, never, found, north, of, the, 63rd, parallel, and, european, russia, except, in, extreme, northern, areas, in, the, east, the, species, distribution, area, stretches, over, the, ural, mountains, to, western, siberia, found, in, the, vicinity, of, khanty, mansiysk, in, asia, the, european, hornet, is, found, in, southern, siberia, as, well, as, in, eastern, china, the, european, hornet, was, accidentally, introduced, to, eastern, north, america, about, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, and, has, lived, there, since, at, about, the, same, latitudes, as, in, europe, however, it, has, never, been, found, in, western, north, america, the, asian, giant, hornet, v, mandarinia, lives, in, the, primorsky, krai, khabarovsky, krai, southern, part, and, jewish, autonomous, oblast, regions, of, russia, and, china, korea, taiwan, cambodia, laos, vietnam, indochina, india, nepal, sri, lanka, and, thailand, but, is, most, commonly, found, in, the, mountains, of, japan, where, they, are, commonly, known, as, the, giant, sparrow, bee, the, oriental, hornet, v, orientalis, occurs, in, semidry, subtropical, areas, of, central, asia, azerbaijan, armenia, dagestan, in, russia, iran, afghanistan, oman, pakistan, bangladesh, turkmenistan, uzbekistan, tajikistan, kyrghyzstan, southern, kazakhstan, and, southern, europe, italy, malta, albania, romania, turkey, greece, bulgaria, cyprus, the, asian, hornet, v, velutina, has, been, introduced, to, france, spain, portugal, italy, and, the, united, kingdom, hornets, have, stingers, used, to, kill, prey, and, defend, nests, hornet, stings, are, more, painful, to, humans, than, typical, wasp, stings, because, hornet, venom, contains, a, large, amount, 5, of, acetylcholine, individual, hornets, can, sting, repeatedly, unlike, honey, bees, hornets, do, not, die, after, stinging, because, their, stingers, are, very, finely, barbed, only, visible, under, high, magnification, and, can, easily, be, withdrawn, so, are, not, pulled, out, of, their, bodies, when, disengaging, the, toxicity, of, hornet, stings, varies, according, to, hornet, species, some, deliver, just, a, typical, insect, sting, while, others, are, among, the, most, venomous, known, insects, single, hornet, stings, are, not, in, themselves, fatal, except, sometimes, to, allergic, victims, multiple, stings, by, hornets, other, than, v, crabro, may, be, fatal, because, of, highly, toxic, species, specific, components, of, their, venom, the, stings, of, the, asian, giant, hornet, v, mandarinia, are, among, the, most, venomous, known, and, are, thought, to, cause, 30, 50, human, deaths, annually, in, japan, between, july, and, september, 2013, hornet, stings, caused, the, death, of, 42, people, in, china, asian, giant, hornet, s, venom, can, cause, allergic, reactions, and, multiple, organ, failure, leading, to, death, though, dialysis, can, be, used, to, remove, the, toxins, from, the, bloodstream, as, with, other, wasps, death, due, to, a, single, sting, on, the, skin, only, occurs, when, an, allergy, is, present, and, serious, outcomes, with, asian, giant, hornet, stings, in, china, and, japan, are, only, documented, with, many, stings, or, anaphylactic, shock, due, to, an, existing, allergy, people, who, are, allergic, to, wasp, venom, may, also, be, allergic, to, hornet, stings, allergic, reactions, are, commonly, treated, with, epinephrine, adrenaline, injection, using, a, device, such, as, an, epinephrine, autoinjector, with, prompt, follow, up, treatment, in, a, hospital, in, severe, cases, allergic, individuals, may, go, into, anaphylactic, shock, and, die, unless, treated, promptly, in, general, vespa, stings, induce, the, release, of, histamine, due, to, the, various, mastoparans, that, they, contain, however, v, orientalis, mastoparan, is, the, interesting, exception, because, it, does, not, induce, histamine, increase, in, victim, tissue, because, it, does, not, cause, mast, cell, degranulation, and, is, not, immunogenic, hornets, like, many, social, wasps, can, mobilize, the, entire, nest, to, sting, in, defense, which, is, highly, dangerous, to, humans, and, other, animals, the, attack, pheromone, is, released, in, case, of, threat, to, the, nest, in, the, case, of, the, asian, giant, hornet, v, mandarinia, this, is, also, used, to, mobilize, many, workers, at, once, when, attacking, colonies, of, their, prey, honey, bees, and, other, vespa, species, three, biologically, active, chemicals, 2, pentanol, isoamyl, alcohol, and, 1, methylbutyl, 3, methylbutanoate, have, been, identified, for, this, species, in, field, tests, 2, pentanol, alone, triggered, mild, alarm, and, defensive, behavior, but, adding, the, other, two, compounds, increased, aggressiveness, in, a, synergistic, effect, in, the, european, hornet, v, crabro, the, major, compound, of, the, alarm, pheromone, is, 2, methyl, 3, butene, 2, ol, if, a, hornet, is, killed, near, a, nest, it, may, release, pheromones, that, can, cause, the, other, hornets, to, attack, materials, that, come, into, contact, with, these, pheromones, such, as, clothes, skin, and, dead, prey, or, hornets, can, also, trigger, an, attack, as, can, certain, food, flavorings, such, as, banana, and, apple, flavorings, and, fragrances, that, contain, c, 5, alcohols, and, c, 10, esters, in, v, crabro, the, nest, is, founded, in, spring, by, a, fertilized, female, known, as, the, queen, she, generally, selects, sheltered, places, such, as, dark, hollow, tree, trunks, she, first, builds, a, series, of, cells, up, to, 50, out, of, chewed, tree, bark, the, cells, are, arranged, in, horizontal, layers, named, combs, each, cell, being, vertical, and, closed, at, the, top, an, egg, is, then, laid, in, each, cell, after, 5, 8, days, the, egg, hatches, over, the, following, two, weeks, the, larva, progresses, through, five, stages, of, development, during, this, time, the, queen, feeds, it, a, protein, rich, diet, of, insects, then, the, larva, spins, a, silk, cap, over, the, cell, s, opening, and, during, the, next, two, weeks, transforms, into, an, adult, a, process, called, metamorphosis, the, adult, then, eats, its, way, through, the, silk, cap, this, first, generation, of, workers, invariably, females, now, gradually, undertakes, all, the, tasks, formerly, carried, out, by, the, queen, foraging, nest, building, taking, care, of, the, brood, etc, with, the, exception, of, egg, laying, which, remains, exclusive, to, the, queen, as, the, colony, size, grows, new, combs, are, added, and, an, envelope, is, built, around, the, cell, layers, until, the, nest, is, entirely, covered, with, the, exception, of, an, entry, hole, to, build, cells, in, total, darkness, they, apparently, use, gravity, to, aid, them, at, the, peak, of, its, population, which, occurs, in, late, summer, the, colony, can, reach, a, size, of, 700, workers, at, this, time, the, queen, starts, producing, the, first, reproductive, individuals, fertilized, eggs, develop, into, females, called, gynes, by, entomologists, and, unfertilized, ones, develop, into, males, sometimes, called, drones, as, with, honeybee, drones, adult, males, do, not, participate, in, nest, maintenance, foraging, or, caretaking, of, the, larvae, in, early, to, mid, autumn, they, leave, the, nest, and, mate, during, nuptial, flights, other, temperate, species, e, g, the, yellow, hornet, v, simillima, or, the, oriental, hornet, v, orientalis, have, similar, cycles, in, the, case, of, tropical, species, e, g, v, tropica, life, histories, may, well, differ, and, in, species, with, both, tropical, and, temperate, distributions, such, as, the, asian, giant, hornet, v, mandarinia, the, cycle, likely, depends, on, latitude, adult, hornets, and, their, relatives, e, g, yellowjackets, feed, themselves, with, nectar, and, sugar, rich, plant, foods, thus, they, can, often, be, found, feeding, on, the, sap, of, oak, trees, rotting, sweet, fruits, honey, and, any, sugar, containing, foodstuffs, hornets, frequently, fly, into, orchards, to, feed, on, overripe, fruit, and, tend, to, gnaw, a, hole, in, fruit, to, become, totally, immersed, in, its, pulp, a, person, who, accidentally, picks, fruit, with, a, feeding, hornet, can, be, attacked, by, the, disturbed, insect, the, adults, also, attack, various, insects, which, they, kill, with, stings, and, jaws, due, to, their, size, and, the, power, of, their, venom, hornets, can, kill, large, insects, such, as, honey, bees, grasshoppers, locusts, and, katydids, without, difficulty, the, victim, is, fully, masticated, and, then, fed, to, the, larvae, developing, in, the, nest, rather, than, consumed, by, the, adult, hornets, some, of, their, prey, being, considered, pests, hornets, may, be, considered, beneficial, under, some, circumstances, the, larvae, of, hornets, produce, a, sweet, secretion, containing, sugars, and, amino, acids, that, workers, and, queens, consume, hornets, ability, to, prey, upon, honey, bees, is, favored, by, a, number, of, adaptations, vespa, have, a, larger, body, size, compared, to, their, prey, a, heavy, exoskeleton, to, resist, bee, attacks, and, strong, mandibles, and, venomous, sting, as, concerns, hornet, hunting, strategies, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, some, species, such, as, v, tropica, and, v, velutina, can, use, both, visual, and, olfactory, cues, for, the, long, range, detection, of, honey, bee, colonies, foragers, of, v, tropica, can, readily, associate, color, and, shape, with, potential, food, sources, and, exhibit, color, generalization, v, velutina, foragers, visually, distinguish, between, bee, dummy, bait, and, cotton, ball, dummy, bait, both, treated, with, bee, odors, preferring, bee, dummies, foraging, hornets, are, also, selectively, attracted, to, honey, bee, colony, odors, in, particular, honey, and, pollen, as, well, as, honey, bee, pheromones, which, may, signal, a, high, prey, density, in, laboratory, assays, workers, of, v, velutina, oriented, especially, towards, geraniol, a, component, of, the, honey, bee, worker, aggregation, pheromone, that, could, therefore, represent, an, honest, signal, for, hornets, behavioral, chemical, and, electrophysiological, analyses, have, also, demonstrated, that, vespa, bicolor, is, attracted, to, z, 11, eicosen, 1, ol, which, is, major, compound, in, the, alarm, pheromones, of, both, asian, apis, cerana, and, european, apis, mellifera, honey, bees, and, its, antennae, respond, to, this, compound, intriguingly, this, hornet, attraction, to, honey, bee, pheromone, is, also, exploited, by, the, orchid, dendrobium, christyanum, which, mimics, the, honey, bee, alarm, pheromone, in, its, flowers, scent, to, attract, hornets, that, visit, and, pollinate, the, flowers, bee, hunting, hornets, therefore, likely, visit, the, non, rewarding, flowers, in, search, of, prey, while, a, history, of, recognizing, subspecies, exists, within, many, of, the, vespa, species, the, most, recent, taxonomic, revision, of, the, genus, treats, all, subspecific, names, in, the, genus, vespa, as, synonyms, effectively, relegating, them, to, no, more, than, informal, names, for, regional, color, forms, hornet, larvae, are, widely, accepted, as, food, in, mountainous, regions, in, china, hornets, and, their, nests, are, treated, as, medicine, in, traditional, chinese, medicine
