pea, pisum, in, latin, is, a, pulse, vegetable, or, fodder, crop, but, the, word, often, refers, to, the, seed, or, sometimes, the, pod, of, this, flowering, plant, species, carl, linnaeus, gave, the, species, the, scientific, name, pisum, sativum, in, 1753, meaning, cultivated, pea, some, sources, now, treat, it, as, lathyrus, oleraceus, however, the, need, and, justification, for, the, change, is, disputed, each, pod, contains, several, seeds, peas, which, can, have, green, or, yellow, cotyledons, when, mature, botanically, pea, pods, are, fruit, since, they, contain, seeds, and, develop, from, the, ovary, of, a, pea, flower, the, name, is, also, used, to, describe, other, edible, seeds, from, the, fabaceae, such, as, the, pigeon, pea, cajanus, cajan, the, cowpea, vigna, unguiculata, the, seeds, from, several, species, of, lathyrus, and, is, used, as, a, compound, form, for, example, sturt, s, desert, pea, peas, are, annual, plants, with, a, life, cycle, of, one, year, they, are, a, cool, season, crop, grown, in, many, parts, of, the, world, planting, can, take, place, from, winter, to, early, summer, depending, on, location, the, average, pea, weighs, between, 0, 1, and, 0, 36, gram, the, immature, peas, and, in, snow, peas, the, tender, pod, as, well, are, used, as, a, vegetable, fresh, frozen, or, canned, varieties, of, the, species, typically, called, field, peas, are, grown, to, produce, dry, peas, like, the, split, pea, shelled, from, a, matured, pod, these, are, the, basis, of, pease, porridge, and, pea, soup, staples, of, medieval, cuisine, in, europe, consuming, fresh, immature, green, peas, was, an, innovation, of, early, modern, cuisine, a, pea, is, a, most, commonly, green, occasionally, golden, yellow, or, infrequently, purple, pod, shaped, vegetable, widely, grown, as, a, cool, season, vegetable, crop, the, seeds, may, be, planted, as, soon, as, the, soil, temperature, reaches, 10, c, 50, f, with, the, plants, growing, best, at, temperatures, of, 13, to, 18, c, 55, to, 64, f, they, do, not, thrive, in, the, summer, heat, of, warmer, temperate, and, lowland, tropical, climates, but, do, grow, well, in, cooler, high, altitude, tropical, areas, many, cultivars, reach, maturity, about, 60, days, after, planting, peas, have, both, low, growing, and, vining, cultivars, the, vining, cultivars, grow, thin, tendrils, from, leaves, that, coil, around, any, available, support, and, can, climb, to, be, 1, to, 2, metres, 3, ft, 3, in, to, 6, ft, 7, in, high, a, traditional, approach, to, supporting, climbing, peas, is, to, thrust, branches, pruned, from, trees, or, other, woody, plants, upright, into, the, soil, providing, a, lattice, for, the, peas, to, climb, branches, used, in, this, fashion, are, called, pea, sticks, or, sometimes, pea, brush, metal, fences, twine, or, netting, supported, by, a, frame, are, used, for, the, same, purpose, in, dense, plantings, peas, give, each, other, some, measure, of, mutual, support, pea, plants, can, self, pollinate, the, wild, pea, is, restricted, to, the, mediterranean, basin, and, the, near, east, the, earliest, archaeological, finds, of, peas, date, from, the, late, neolithic, era, of, current, syria, anatolia, israel, iraq, jordan, and, greece, in, egypt, early, finds, date, from, c, 4800, 4400, bc, in, the, nile, delta, area, and, from, c, 3800, 3600, bc, in, upper, egypt, the, pea, was, also, present, in, georgia, in, the, 5th, millennium, bc, farther, east, the, finds, are, younger, peas, were, present, in, afghanistan, c, 2000, bc, in, harappan, civilization, around, modern, day, pakistan, and, western, and, northwestern, india, in, 2250, 1750, bc, in, the, second, half, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, this, legume, crop, appears, in, the, ganges, basin, and, southern, india, in, early, times, peas, were, grown, mostly, for, their, dry, seeds, from, plants, growing, wild, in, the, mediterranean, basin, constant, selection, since, the, neolithic, dawn, of, agriculture, improved, their, yield, in, the, early, 3rd, century, bc, theophrastus, mentions, peas, among, the, legumes, that, are, sown, late, in, the, winter, because, of, their, tenderness, in, the, first, century, ad, columella, mentions, them, in, de, re, rustica, when, roman, legionaries, still, gathered, wild, peas, from, the, sandy, soils, of, numidia, and, judea, to, supplement, their, rations, in, the, middle, ages, field, peas, are, constantly, mentioned, as, they, were, the, staple, that, kept, famine, at, bay, as, charles, the, good, count, of, flanders, noted, explicitly, in, 1124, green, garden, peas, eaten, immature, and, fresh, were, an, innovative, luxury, of, early, modern, europe, in, england, the, distinction, between, field, peas, and, garden, peas, dates, from, the, early, 17th, century, john, gerard, and, john, parkinson, both, mention, garden, peas, sugar, peas, which, the, french, called, mange, tout, because, they, were, eaten, pods, and, all, were, introduced, to, france, from, the, market, gardens, of, holland, in, the, time, of, henri, iv, through, the, french, ambassador, green, peas, were, introduced, from, genoa, to, the, court, of, louis, xiv, of, france, in, january, 1660, with, some, staged, fanfare, a, hamper, of, them, was, presented, before, the, king, they, were, shelled, by, the, savoyan, comte, de, soissons, who, had, married, a, niece, of, cardinal, mazarin, little, dishes, of, peas, were, then, presented, to, the, king, the, queen, cardinal, mazarin, and, monsieur, the, king, s, brother, immediately, established, and, grown, for, earliness, warmed, with, manure, and, protected, under, glass, they, were, still, a, luxurious, delicacy, in, 1696, when, mme, de, maintenon, and, mme, de, sevign, each, reported, that, they, were, a, fashion, a, fury, the, world, s, first, sweet, tasting, pea, was, developed, in, the, 18th, century, by, amateur, plant, breeder, thomas, edward, knight, of, downton, near, salisbury, england, modern, split, peas, with, their, indigestible, skins, rubbed, off, are, a, development, of, the, later, 19th, century, the, top, producer, of, green, peas, by, far, is, china, with, 12, 2, million, tons, followed, by, india, 4, 8, million, tons, usa, 0, 31, million, tons, france, 0, 23, million, tons, and, egypt, 0, 15, million, tons, united, kingdom, pakistan, algeria, peru, and, turkey, complete, the, top, 10, the, term, pea, originates, from, the, latin, word, pisum, which, is, the, latinisation, of, the, greek, pison, neuter, variant, form, of, pisos, pea, it, was, adopted, into, english, as, the, noun, pease, plural, peasen, as, in, pease, pudding, however, by, analogy, with, other, plurals, ending, in, s, speakers, began, construing, pease, as, a, plural, and, constructing, the, singular, form, by, dropping, the, s, giving, the, term, pea, this, process, is, known, as, back, formation, raw, green, peas, are, 79, water, 14,

source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, vitamin, c, 48, dv, vitamin, k, thiamine, and, manganese, with, several, b, vitamins, and, dietary, minerals, in, moderate, amounts, 11, 16, dv, table, the, pea, karyotype, consists, of, seven, chromosomes, five, of, which, are, acrocentric, and, two, submetacentric, despite, its, scientific, popularity, its, relatively, large, genome, size, 4, 45, gb, made, it, challenging, to, sequence, compared, to, other, legumes, such, as, medicago, truncatula, and, soybeans, the, international, pea, genome, sequencing, consortium, was, formed, to, develop, the, first, pea, reference, genome, and, the, draft, assembly, was, officially, announced, in, september, 2019, it, covers, 88, of, the, genome, 3, 92gb, and, predicted, 44, 791, gene, coding, sequences, the, pea, used, for, the, assembly, was, the, inbred, french, cultivar, cam, or, there, are, many, varieties, cultivars, of, garden, peas, some, of, the, most, common, varieties, are, listed, here, pmr, indicates, some, degree, of, powdery, mildew, resistance, afila, types, also, called, semi, leafless, have, clusters, of, tendrils, instead, of, leaves, unless, otherwise, noted, these, are, so, called, dwarf, varieties, which, grow, to, an, average, height, of, about, 1m, giving, the, vines, support, is, recommended, but, not, required, extra, dwarf, are, suitable, for, container, growing, reaching, only, about, 25, cm, tall, varieties, grow, to, about, 2m, with, support, required, some, peas, lack, the, tough, membrane, inside, the, pod, wall, and, have, tender, edible, pods, there, are, two, main, types, the, name, sugar, pea, can, include, both, types, or, be, synonymous, with, either, snow, peas, or, snap, peas, in, different, dictionaries, likewise, mangetout, m, t, u, from, french, pois, mange, tout, eat, all, pea, snow, peas, and, snap, peas, both, belong, to, macrocarpon, group, a, cultivar, group, based, on, the, variety, pisum, sativum, var, macrocarpum, ser, named, in, 1825, it, was, described, as, having, very, compressed, non, leathery, edible, pods, in, the, original, publication, the, scientific, name, pisum, sativum, var, saccharatum, ser, is, often, misused, for, snow, peas, the, variety, under, this, name, was, described, as, having, sub, leathery, and, compressed, terete, pods, and, a, french, name, of, petit, pois, the, description, is, inconsistent, with, the, appearance, of, snow, peas, and, therefore, botanists, have, replaced, this, name, with, pisum, sativum, var, macrocarpum, the, field, pea, is, a, type, of, pea, sometimes, called, p, sativum, subsp, arvense, l, asch, it, is, also, known, as, dun, grey, brown, pea, kapucijner, pea, or, austrian, winter, pea, and, is, one, of, the, oldest, domesticated, crops, cultivated, for, at, least, 7, 000, years, field, peas, are, now, grown, in, many, countries, for, both, human, consumption, and, stockfeed, there, are, several, cultivars, and, colors, including, blue, dun, brown, maple, and, white, this, pea, should, not, be, confused, with, the, cowpea, vigna, unguiculata, which, is, sometimes, called, the, field, pea, in, warmer, climates, it, is, a, climbing, annual, legume, with, weak, viny, and, relatively, succulent, stems, vines, often, are, 4, to, 5, feet, 120, to, 150, cm, long, but, when, grown, alone, field, pea, s, weak, stems, prevent, it, from, growing, more, than, 1, 5, to, 2, feet, 45, to, 60, cm, tall, leaves, have, two, leaflets, and, a, tendril, flowers, are, white, pink, or, purple, pods, carry, seeds, that, are, large, 4, 000, seeds, lb, nearly, spherical, and, white, gray, green, or, brown, the, root, system, is, relatively, shallow, and, small, but, well, nodulated, the, field, pea, is, a, cool, season, legume, crop, that, is, grown, on, over, 25, million, acres, worldwide, it, has, been, an, important, grain, legume, crop, for, millennia, seeds, showing, domesticated, characteristics, dating, from, at, least, 7000, years, ago, have, been, found, in, archaeological, sites, around, what, is, now, turkey, field, peas, or, dry, peas, are, marketed, as, a, dry, shelled, product, for, either, human, or, livestock, food, unlike, the, garden, pea, which, is, marketed, as, a, fresh, or, canned, vegetable, the, major, producing, countries, of, field, peas, are, russia, and, china, followed, by, canada, europe, australia, and, the, united, states, europe, australia, canada, and, the, united, states, raise, over, 4, 5, million, acres, 18, 000, km, and, are, major, exporters, of, peas, in, 2002, there, were, approximately, 300, 000, acres, 1, 200, km, of, field, peas, grown, in, the, united, states, in, modern, times, peas, are, usually, boiled, or, steamed, which, breaks, down, the, cell, walls, and, makes, them, taste, sweeter, and, the, nutrients, more, bioavailable, along, with, broad, beans, and, lentils, these, formed, an, important, part, of, the, diet, of, most, people, in, the, middle, east, north, africa, and, europe, during, the, middle, ages, by, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, it, had, become, popular, to, eat, peas, green, that, is, while, they, are, immature, and, right, after, they, are, picked, new, cultivars, of, peas, were, developed, by, the, english, during, this, time, which, became, known, as, garden, or, english, peas, the, popularity, of, green, peas, spread, to, north, america, thomas, jefferson, grew, more, than, 30, cultivars, of, peas, on, his, estate, with, the, invention, of, canning, peas, were, one, of, the, first, vegetables, to, be, canned, fresh, peas, are, often, eaten, boiled, and, flavored, with, butter, and, or, spearmint, as, a, side, dish, vegetable, salt, and, pepper, are, also, commonly, added, to, peas, when, served, fresh, peas, are, also, used, in, pot, pies, salads, and, casseroles, pod, peas, snow, peas, and, snap, peas, are, used, in, stir, fried, dishes, particularly, those, in, american, chinese, cuisine, pea, pods, do, not, keep, well, once, picked, and, if, not, used, quickly, are, best, preserved, by, drying, canning, or, freezing, within, a, few, hours, of, harvest, in, india, fresh, peas, are, used, in, various, dishes, such, as, aloo, matar, curried, potatoes, with, peas, or, mattar, paneer, paneer, cheese, with, peas, though, they, can, be, substituted, with, frozen, peas, as, well, peas, are, also, eaten, raw, as, they, are, sweet, when, fresh, off, the, bush, green, peas, known, as, hasiru, batani, in, kannada, are, used, to, make, curry, and, gasi, split, peas, are, also, used, to, make, dal, particularly, in, guyana, and, trinidad, where, there, is, a, significant, population, of, indians, dried, peas, are, often, made, into, a, soup, or, simply, eaten, on, their, own, in, japan, china, taiwan, and, some, southeast, asian, countries, including, thailand, the, philippines, and, malaysia, peas, are, roasted, and, salted, and, eaten, as, snacks, in, the, philippines, peas, while, still, in, their, pods, are, a, common, ingredient, in, viands, and, pansit, in, the, uk, dried, yellow, or, green, split, peas, are, used, to, make, pease, pudding, or, pease, porridge, a, traditional, dish, in, north, america, a, similarly, traditional, dish, is, split, pea, soup, pea, soup, is, eaten, in, many, other, parts, of, the, world, including, northern, europe, parts, of, middle, europe, russia, iran, iraq, and, india, in, chinese, cuisine, the, tender, new, growth, dou, miao, d, u, mi, o, are, commonly, used, in, stir, fries, much, like, picking, the, leaves, for, tea, the, farmers, pick, the, tips, off, of, the, pea, plant, in, greece, tunisia, turkey, cyprus, and, other, parts, of, the, mediterranean, peas, are, made, into, a, stew, with, lamb, and, potatoes, in, hungary, and, serbia, pea, soup, is, often, served, with, dumplings, and, spiced, with, hot, paprika, in, the, united, kingdom, dried, rehydrated, and, mashed, marrowfat, peas, or, cooked, green, split, peas, known, as, mushy, peas, are, popular, originally, in, the, north, of, england, but, now, ubiquitously, and, especially, as, an, accompaniment, to, fish, and, chips, or, meat, pies, particularly, in, fish, and, chip, shops, sodium, bicarbonate, is, sometimes, added, to, soften, the, peas, in, 2005, a, poll, of, 2, 000, people, revealed, the, pea, to, be, britain, s, seventh, favourite, culinary, vegetable, processed, peas, are, mature, peas, which, have, been, dried, soaked, and, then, heat, treated, processed, to, prevent, spoilage, in, the, same, manner, as, pasteurizing, cooked, peas, are, sometimes, sold, dried, and, coated, with, wasabi, salt, or, other, spices, in, north, america, pea, milk, is, produced, and, sold, as, an, alternative, to, cow, milk, for, a, variety, of, reasons, in, east, asia, pea, sprouts, or, shoots, were, once, dedicated, cuisine, when, the, plant, was, less, highly, available, today, when, the, plant, can, be, easily, grown, fresh, pea, shoots, are, available, in, supermarkets, or, may, be, grown, at, home, in, order, to, freeze, and, preserve, peas, they, must, first, be, grown, picked, and, shelled, usually, the, more, tender, the, peas, are, the, more, likely, that, they, will, be, used, in, the, final, product, the, peas, must, be, put, through, the, process, of, freezing, shortly, after, being, picked, so, that, they, do, not, spoil, too, soon, once, the, peas, have, been, selected, they, are, placed, in, ice, water, and, allowed, to, cool, after, they, are, sprayed, with, water, to, remove, any, residual, dirt, or, dust, that, may, remain, on, them, the, next, step, is, blanching, the, peas, are, boiled, for, a, few, minutes, to, remove, any, enzymes, that, may, shorten, their, shelf, life, they, are, then, cooled, and, removed, from, the, water, the, final, step, is, the, actual, freezing, to, produce, the, final, product, this, step, may, vary, considerably, some, companies, freeze, their, peas, by, air, blast, freezing, where, the, vegetables, are, put, through, a, tunnel, at, high, speeds, and, frozen, by, cold, air, finally, the, peas, are, packaged, and, shipped, out, for, retail, sale, in, the, mid, 19th, century, austrian, monk, gregor, mendel, s, observations, of, pea, pods, led, to, the, principles, of, mendelian, genetics, the, foundation, of, modern, genetics, he, ended, up, growing, and, examining, about, 28, 000, pea, plants, in, the, course, of, his, experiments, mendel, chose, peas, for, his, experiments, because, he, could, grow, them, easily, pure, bred, strains, were, readily, available, and, the, structure, of, the, flowers, protect, them, from, cross, pollination, and, cross, pollination, was, easy, mendel, cross, bred, tall, and, dwarf, pea, plants, green, and, yellow, peas, purple, and, white, flowers, wrinkled, and, smooth, peas, and, a, few, other, traits, he, then, observed, the, resulting, offspring, in, each, of, these, cases, one, trait, is, dominant, and, all, the, offspring, or, filial, 1, abbreviated, f, 1, generation, showed, the, dominant, trait, then, he, allowed, the, f, 1, generation, to, self, pollinate, and, observed, their, offspring, the, filial, 2, abbreviated, f, 2, generation, the, f, 2, plants, had, the, dominant, trait, in, approximately, a, 3, 1, ratio, he, studied, later, generations, of, self, pollinated, plants, and, performed, crosses, to, determine, the, nature, of, the, pollen, and, egg, cells, mendel, reasoned, that, each, parent, had, a, vote, in, the, appearance, of, the, offspring, and, the, non, dominant, or, recessive, trait, appeared, only, when, it, was, inherited, from, both, parents, he, did, further, experiments, that, showed, each, trait, is, separately, inherited, unwittingly, mendel, had, solved, a, major, problem, with, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, how, new, traits, were, preserved, and, not, blended, back, into, the, population, a, question, darwin, himself, did, not, answer, mendel, s, work, was, published, in, an, obscure, austrian, journal, and, was, not, rediscovered, until, about, 1900, some, people, experience, allergic, reactions, to, peas, as, well, as, lentils, with, vicilin, or, convicilin, as, the, most, common, allergens, favism, or, fava, bean, ism, is, a, genetic, deficiency, of, the, enzyme, glucose, 6, phosphate, dehydrogenase, that, affects, jews, other, middle, eastern, semitic, peoples, and, other, descendants, of, the, mediterranean, coastal, regions, in, this, condition, the, toxic, reaction, to, eating, most, if, not, all, beans, is, hemolytic, anemia, and, in, severe, cases, the, released, circulating, free, hemoglobin, causes, acute, kidney, injury, peas, like, many, legumes, contain, symbiotic, bacteria, called, rhizobia, within, root, nodules, of, their, root, systems, these, bacteria, have, the, special, ability, to, fix, nitrogen, from, atmospheric, molecular, nitrogen, n, 2, into, ammonia, nh, 3, the, chemical, reaction, is, ammonia, is, then, converted, to, another, form, ammonium, nh, 4, usable, by, some, plants, by, the, following, reaction, the, root, nodules, of, peas, and, other, legumes, are, sources, of, nitrogen, that, they, can, use, to, make, amino, acids, constituents, of, proteins, hence, legumes, are, good, sources, of, plant, protein, when, a, pea, plant, dies, in, the, field, for, example, following, the, harvest, all, of, its, remaining, nitrogen, incorporated, into, amino, acids, inside, the, remaining, plant, parts, is, released, back, into, the, soil, in, the, soil, the, amino, acids, are, converted, to, nitrate, no, 3, that, is, available, to, other, plants, thereby, serving, as, fertilizer, for, future, crops, pea, grading, involves, sorting, peas, by, size, in, which, the, smallest, peas, are, graded, as, the, highest, quality, for, their, tenderness, brines, may, be, used, in, which, peas, are, floated, from, which, their, density, can, be, determined, a, variety, of, diseases, affect, peas, through, a, number, of, pathogens, including, insects, viruses, bacteria, and, fungi, in, particular, virus, disease, of, peas, has, worldwide, economic, importance, additionally, insects, such, as, the, pea, leaf, weevil, sitona, lineatus, can, damage, peas, and, other, pod, fruits, the, pea, leaf, weevil, is, native, to, europe, but, has, spread, to, other, places, such, as, alberta, canada, they, are, about, 3, 5, millimetres, 0, 14, in, 5, 5, millimetres, 0, 22, in, long, and, are, distinguishable, by, three, light, coloured, stripes, running, length, wise, down, the, thorax, the, weevil, larvae, feed, on, the, root, nodules, of, pea, plants, which, are, essential, to, the, plants, supply, of, nitrogen, and, thus, diminish, leaf, and, stem, growth, adult, weevils, feed, on, the, leaves, and, create, a, notched, c, shaped, appearance, on, the, outside, of, the, leaves, the, pea, moth, can, be, a, serious, pest, producing, caterpillars, the, resemble, small, white, maggots, in, the, pea, pods, the, caterpillars, eat, the, developing, peas, making, them, unsightly, and, unsuitable, for, culinary, use, prior, to, the, use, of, modern, insecticides, pea, moth, caterpillars, were, a, very, common, sight, in, pea, pods
