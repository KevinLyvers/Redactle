the, impala, or, rooibok, aepyceros, melampus, is, a, medium, sized, antelope, found, in, eastern, and, southern, africa, the, only, extant, member, of, the, genus, aepyceros, and, tribe, aepycerotini, it, was, first, described, to, europeans, by, german, zoologist, hinrich, lichtenstein, in, 1812, two, subspecies, are, recognised, the, grassland, dwelling, common, impala, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, kenyan, impala, and, the, larger, and, darker, black, faced, impala, which, lives, in, slightly, more, arid, scrubland, environments, the, impala, reaches, 70, 92, cm, 28, 36, in, at, the, shoulder, and, weighs, 40, 76, kg, 88, 168, lb, it, features, a, glossy, reddish, brown, coat, the, male, s, slender, lyre, shaped, horns, are, 45, 92, cm, 18, 36, in, long, active, mainly, during, the, day, the, impala, may, be, gregarious, or, territorial, depending, upon, the, climate, and, geography, three, distinct, social, groups, can, be, observed, the, territorial, males, bachelor, herds, and, female, herds, the, impala, is, known, for, two, characteristic, leaps, that, constitute, an, anti, predator, strategy, browsers, as, well, as, grazers, impala, feed, on, monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits, and, acacia, pods, whenever, available, an, annual, three, week, long, rut, takes, place, toward, the, end, of, the, wet, season, typically, in, may, rutting, males, fight, over, dominance, and, the, victorious, male, courts, females, in, oestrus, gestation, lasts, six, to, seven, months, following, which, a, single, calf, is, born, and, immediately, concealed, in, cover, calves, are, suckled, for, four, to, six, months, young, males, forced, out, of, the, all, female, groups, join, bachelor, herds, while, females, may, stay, back, the, impala, is, found, in, woodlands, and, sometimes, on, the, interface, ecotone, between, woodlands, and, savannahs, it, inhabits, places, near, water, while, the, black, faced, impala, is, confined, to, southwestern, angola, and, kaokoland, in, northwestern, namibia, the, common, impala, is, widespread, across, its, range, and, has, been, reintroduced, in, gabon, and, southern, africa, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, classifies, the, impala, as, a, species, of, least, concern, the, black, faced, subspecies, has, been, classified, as, a, vulnerable, species, with, fewer, than, 1, 000, individuals, remaining, in, the, wild, as, of, 2008, the, first, attested, english, name, in, 1802, was, palla, or, pallah, from, the, tswana, phala, red, antelope, the, name, impala, also, spelled, impalla, or, mpala, is, first, attested, in, 1875, and, is, directly, from, zulu, its, afrikaans, name, rooibok, red, buck, is, also, sometimes, used, in, english, the, scientific, generic, name, aepyceros, lit, high, horned, comes, from, ancient, greek, aipus, high, steep, keras, horn, the, specific, name, melampus, lit, black, foot, from, melas, black, pous, foot, the, impala, is, the, sole, member, of, the, genus, aepyceros, and, belongs, to, the, family, bovidae, it, was, first, described, by, german, zoologist, martin, hinrich, carl, lichtenstein, in, 1812, in, 1984, palaeontologist, elisabeth, vrba, opined, that, the, impala, is, a, sister, taxon, to, the, alcelaphines, given, its, resemblance, to, the, hartebeest, a, 1999, phylogenetic, study, by, alexandre, hassanin, of, the, national, centre, for, scientific, research, paris, and, colleagues, based, on, mitochondrial, and, nuclear, analyses, showed, that, the, impala, forms, a, clade, with, the, suni, neotragus, moschatus, this, clade, is, sister, to, another, formed, by, the, bay, duiker, cephalophus, dorsalis, and, the, klipspringer, oreotragus, oreotragus, an, rrna, and, spectrin, nuclear, sequence, analysis, in, 2003, also, supported, an, association, between, aepyceros, and, neotragus, the, following, cladogram, is, based, on, the, 1999, study, sheep, ovis, aries, bontebok, damaliscus, pygargus, sable, antelope, hippotragus, niger, klipspringer, oreotragus, oreotragus, bay, duiker, cephalophus, dorsalis, impala, aepyceros, melampus, suni, neotragus, moschatus, grant, s, gazelle, nanger, granti, mountain, reedbuck, redunca, fulvorufula, up, to, six, subspecies, have, been, described, although, only, two, are, generally, recognised, on, the, basis, of, mitochondrial, data, though, morphologically, similar, the, subspecies, show, a, significant, genetic, distance, between, them, and, no, hybrids, between, them, have, been, reported, according, to, vrba, the, impala, evolved, from, an, alcelaphine, ancestor, she, noted, that, while, this, ancestor, has, diverged, at, least, 18, times, into, various, morphologically, different, forms, the, impala, has, continued, in, its, basic, form, for, at, least, five, million, years, several, fossil, species, have, been, discovered, including, a, datoadeni, from, the, pliocene, of, ethiopia, the, oldest, fossil, discovered, suggests, its, ancient, ancestors, were, slightly, smaller, than, the, modern, form, but, otherwise, very, similar, in, all, aspects, to, the, latter, this, implies, that, the, impala, has, efficiently, adapted, to, its, environment, since, prehistoric, times, its, gregarious, nature, variety, in, diet, positive, population, trend, defence, against, ticks, and, symbiotic, relationship, with, the, tick, feeding, oxpeckers, could, have, played, a, role, in, preventing, major, changes, in, morphology, and, behaviour, the, impala, is, a, medium, sized, slender, bodied, antelope, comparable, to, the, kob, puku, and, grant, s, gazelle, in, size, and, build, the, head, and, body, length, is, around, 130, centimetres, 51, in, males, reach, approximately, 75, 92, cm, 30, 36, in, at, the, shoulder, while, females, are, 70, 85, cm, 28, 33, in, tall, males, typically, weigh, 53, 76, kilograms, 117, 168, lb, and, females, 40, 53, kg, 88, 117, lb, sexually, dimorphic, females, are, hornless, and, smaller, than, males, males, grow, slender, lyre, shaped, horns, 45, 92, cm, 18, 36, in, long, the, horns, strongly, ridged, and, divergent, are, circular, in, section, and, hollow, at, the, base, their, arch, like, structure, allows, interlocking, of, horns, which, helps, a, male, throw, off, his, opponent, during, fights, horns, also, protect, the, skull, from, damage, the, glossy, coat, of, the, impala, shows, two, tone, colouration, the, reddish, brown, back, and, the, tan, flanks, these, are, in, sharp, contrast, to, the, white, underbelly, facial, features, include, white, rings, around, the, eyes, and, a, light, chin, and, snout, the, ears, 17, cm, 6, 7, in, long, are, tipped, with, black, black, streaks, run, from, the, buttocks, to, the, upper, hindlegs, the, bushy, white, tail, 30, cm, 12, in, long, features, a, solid, black, stripe, along, the, midline, the, impala, s, colouration, bears, a, strong, resemblance, to, the, gerenuk, which, has, shorter, horns, and, lacks, the, black, thigh, stripes, of, the, impala, the, impala, has, scent, glands, covered, by, a, black, tuft, of, hair, on, the, hindlegs, 2, methylbutanoic, acid, and, 2, nonanone, have, been, identified, from, this, gland, sebaceous, glands, concentrated, on, the, forehead, and, dispersed, on, the, torso, of, dominant, males, are, most, active, during, the, mating, season, while, those, of, females, are, only, partially, developed, and, do, not, undergo, seasonal, changes, there, are, four, nipples, of, the, subspecies, the, black, faced, impala, is, significantly, larger, and, darker, than, the, common, impala, melanism, is, responsible, for, the, black, colouration, distinctive, of, the, black, faced, impala, is, a, dark, stripe, on, either, side, of, the, nose, that, runs, upward, to, the, eyes, and, thins, as, it, reaches, the, forehead, other, differences, include, the, larger, black, tip, on, the, ear, and, a, bushier, and, nearly, 30, longer, tail, in, the, black, faced, impala, the, impala, has, a, special, dental, arrangement, on, the, front, lower, jaw, similar, to, the, toothcomb, seen, in, strepsirrhine, primates, which, is, used, during, allogrooming, to, comb, the, fur, on, the, head, and, the, neck, and, remove, ectoparasites, the, impala, is, diurnal, active, mainly, during, the, day, though, activity, tends, to, cease, during, the, hot, midday, hours, they, feed, and, rest, at, night, three, distinct, social, groups, can, be, observed, the, territorial, males, bachelor, herds, and, female, herds, the, territorial, males, hold, territories, where, they, may, form, harems, of, females, territories, are, demarcated, with, urine, and, faeces, and, defended, against, juvenile, or, male, intruders, bachelor, herds, tend, to, be, small, with, less, than, 30, members, individuals, maintain, distances, of, 2, 5, 3, m, 8, 2, 9, 8, ft, from, one, another, while, young, and, old, males, may, interact, middle, aged, males, generally, avoid, one, another, except, to, spar, female, herds, vary, in, size, from, 6, to, 100, herds, occupy, home, ranges, of, 80, 180, ha, 200, 440, acres, 0, 31, 0, 69, sq, mi, the, mother, calf, bond, is, weak, and, breaks, soon, after, weaning, juveniles, leave, the, herds, of, their, mothers, to, join, other, herds, female, herds, tend, to, be, loose, and, have, no, obvious, leadership, allogrooming, is, an, important, means, of, social, interaction, in, bachelor, and, female, herds, in, fact, the, impala, appears, to, be, the, only, ungulate, to, display, self, grooming, as, well, as, allogrooming, in, allogrooming, females, typically, groom, related, impalas, while, males, associate, with, unrelated, ones, each, partner, grooms, the, other, six, to, twelve, times, social, behaviour, is, influenced, by, the, climate, and, geography, as, such, the, impala, are, territorial, at, certain, times, of, the, year, and, gregarious, at, other, times, and, the, length, of, these, periods, can, vary, broadly, among, populations, for, instance, populations, in, southern, africa, display, territorial, behaviour, only, during, the, few, months, of, the, rut, whereas, in, eastern, african, populations, territoriality, is, relatively, minimal, despite, a, protracted, mating, season, moreover, territorial, males, often, tolerate, bachelors, and, may, even, alternate, between, bachelorhood, and, territoriality, at, different, times, of, the, year, a, study, of, impala, in, the, serengeti, national, park, showed, that, in, 94, of, the, males, territoriality, was, observed, for, less, than, four, months, the, impala, is, an, important, prey, species, for, africa, s, large, carnivores, such, as, cheetahs, leopards, wild, dogs, lions, hyenas, crocodiles, and, pythons, the, antelope, displays, two, characteristic, leaps, it, can, jump, up, to, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, over, vegetation, and, even, other, impala, covering, distances, of, up, to, 10, m, 33, ft, the, other, type, of, leap, involves, a, series, of, jumps, in, which, the, animal, lands, on, its, forelegs, moves, its, hindlegs, mid, air, in, a, kicking, fashion, lands, on, all, fours, stotting, and, then, rebounds, it, leaps, in, either, manner, in, different, directions, probably, to, confuse, predators, at, times, the, impala, may, also, conceal, itself, in, vegetation, to, escape, the, eye, of, the, predator, the, most, prominent, vocalisation, is, the, loud, roar, delivered, through, one, to, three, loud, snorts, with, the, mouth, closed, followed, by, two, to, ten, deep, grunts, with, the, mouth, open, and, the, chin, and, tail, raised, a, typical, roar, can, be, heard, up, to, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, away, scent, gland, secretions, identify, a, territorial, male, impalas, are, sedentary, adult, and, middle, aged, males, in, particular, can, hold, their, territories, for, years, common, ixodid, ticks, collected, from, impala, include, amblyomma, hebraeum, boophilus, decoloratus, hyalomma, marginatum, ixodes, cavipalpus, rhipicephalus, appendiculatus, and, r, evertsi, in, zimbabwe, heavy, infestation, by, ticks, such, as, r, appendiculatus, has, proved, to, be, a, major, cause, behind, the, high, mortality, of, ungulates, as, they, can, lead, to, tick, paralysis, impala, have, special, adaptations, for, grooming, such, as, their, characteristic, dental, arrangement, to, manage, ticks, before, they, engorge, however, the, extensive, grooming, needed, to, keep, the, tick, load, under, control, involves, the, risk, of, dehydration, during, summer, lower, vigilance, against, predators, and, gradual, wearing, out, of, the, teeth, a, study, showed, that, impala, adjust, the, time, devoted, to, grooming, and, the, number, of, grooming, bouts, according, to, the, seasonal, prevalence, of, ticks, impala, are, symbiotically, related, to, oxpeckers, which, feed, on, ticks, from, those, parts, of, the, antelope, s, body, which, the, animal, cannot, access, by, itself, such, as, the, ears, neck, eyelids, forehead, and, underbelly, the, impala, is, the, smallest, ungulate, with, which, oxpeckers, are, associated, in, a, study, it, was, observed, that, oxpeckers, selectively, attended, to, impala, despite, the, presence, of, other, animals, such, as, coke, s, hartebeest, grant, s, gazelle, thomson, s, gazelle, and, topi, a, possible, explanation, for, this, could, be, that, because, the, impala, inhabits, woodlands, which, can, have, a, high, density, of, ticks, the, impala, could, have, greater, mass, of, ticks, per, unit, area, of, the, body, surface, another, study, showed, that, the, oxpeckers, prefer, the, ears, over, other, parts, of, the, body, probably, because, these, parts, show, maximum, tick, infestation, the, bird, has, also, been, observed, to, perch, on, the, udders, of, a, female, and, pilfer, its, milk, lice, recorded, from, impala, include, damalinia, aepycerus, d, elongata, linognathus, aepycerus, and, l, nevilli, in, a, study, ivermectin, a, medication, against, parasites, was, found, to, have, an, effect, on, boophilus, decoloratus, and, linognathus, species, though, not, on, damalinia, species, in, a, study, of, impala, in, south, africa, the, number, of, worms, in, juveniles, showed, an, increase, with, age, reaching, a, peak, when, impala, turned, a, year, old, this, study, recorded, worms, of, genera, such, as, cooperia, cooperoides, fasciola, gongylonema, haemonchus, impalaia, longistrongylus, and, trichostrongylus, some, of, these, showed, seasonal, variations, in, density, impala, show, high, frequency, of, defensive, behaviours, towards, flying, insects, this, is, probably, the, reason, for, vale, 1977, and, clausen, et, al, 1998, only, finding, trace, levels, of, feeding, by, glossina, tsetse, fly, upon, impala, theileria, of, impala, in, kenya, are, not, cross, infectious, to, cattle, grootenhuis, et, al, 1975, were, not, able, to, induce, cattle, infection, and, fawcett, et, al, 1987, did, not, find, it, naturally, occurring, impala, browse, as, well, as, graze, either, may, predominate, depending, upon, the, availability, of, resources, the, diet, comprises, monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits, and, acacia, pods, whenever, available, impala, prefer, places, close, to, water, sources, and, resort, to, succulent, vegetation, if, water, is, scarce, an, analysis, showed, that, the, diet, of, impala, is, composed, of, 45, monocots, 45, dicots, and, 10, fruits, the, proportion, of, grasses, in, the, diet, increases, significantly, to, as, high, as, 90, after, the, first, rains, but, declines, in, the, dry, season, browsing, predominates, in, the, late, wet, and, dry, season, and, diets, are, nutritionally, poor, in, the, mid, dry, season, when, impala, feed, mostly, on, woody, dicots, another, study, showed, that, the, dicot, proportion, in, the, diet, is, much, higher, in, bachelors, and, females, than, in, territorial, males, impala, feed, on, soft, and, nutritious, grasses, such, as, digitaria, macroblephara, tough, tall, grasses, such, as, heteropogon, contortus, and, themeda, triandra, are, typically, avoided, impala, on, the, periphery, of, the, herds, are, generally, more, vigilant, against, predators, than, those, feeding, in, the, centre, a, foraging, individual, will, try, to, defend, the, patch, it, is, feeding, on, by, lowering, its, head, a, study, revealed, that, time, spent, in, foraging, reaches, a, maximum, of, 75, 5, of, the, day, in, the, late, dry, season, decreases, through, the, rainy, season, and, is, minimal, in, the, early, dry, season, 57, 8, males, are, sexually, mature, by, the, time, they, are, a, year, old, though, successful, mating, generally, occurs, only, after, four, years, mature, males, start, establishing, territories, and, try, to, gain, access, to, females, females, can, conceive, after, they, are, a, year, and, a, half, old, oestrus, lasts, for, 24, to, 48, hours, and, occurs, every, 12, 29, days, in, non, pregnant, females, the, annual, three, week, long, rut, breeding, season, begins, toward, the, end, of, the, wet, season, typically, in, may, gonadal, growth, and, hormone, production, in, males, begin, a, few, months, before, the, breeding, season, resulting, in, greater, aggressiveness, and, territoriality, the, bulbourethral, glands, are, heavier, testosterone, levels, are, nearly, twice, as, high, in, territorial, males, as, in, bachelors, and, the, neck, of, a, territorial, male, tends, to, be, thicker, than, that, of, a, bachelor, during, the, rut, mating, tends, to, take, place, between, full, moons, rutting, males, fight, over, dominance, often, giving, out, noisy, roars, and, chasing, one, another, they, walk, stiffly, and, display, their, neck, and, horns, males, desist, from, feeding, and, allogrooming, during, the, rut, probably, to, devote, more, time, to, garnering, females, in, oestrus, the, male, checks, the, female, s, urine, to, ensure, that, she, is, in, oestrus, on, coming, across, such, a, female, the, excited, male, begins, the, courtship, by, pursuing, her, keeping, a, distance, of, 3, 5, metres, 9, 8, 16, 4, ft, from, her, the, male, flicks, his, tongue, and, may, nod, vigorously, the, female, allows, him, to, lick, her, vulva, and, holds, her, tail, to, one, side, the, male, tries, mounting, the, female, holding, his, head, high, and, clasping, her, sides, with, his, forelegs, mounting, attempts, may, be, repeated, every, few, seconds, to, every, minute, or, two, the, male, loses, interest, in, the, female, after, the, first, copulation, though, she, is, still, active, and, can, mate, with, other, males, gestation, lasts, six, to, seven, months, births, generally, occur, in, the, midday, the, female, will, isolate, herself, from, the, herd, when, labour, pain, begins, the, perception, that, females, can, delay, giving, birth, for, an, additional, month, if, conditions, are, harsh, may, however, not, be, realistic, a, single, calf, is, born, and, is, immediately, concealed, in, cover, for, the, first, few, weeks, of, its, birth, the, fawn, then, joins, a, nursery, group, within, its, mother, s, herd, calves, are, suckled, for, four, to, six, months, young, males, forced, out, of, the, group, join, bachelor, herds, while, females, may, stay, back, the, impala, inhabits, woodlands, due, to, its, preference, for, shade, it, can, also, be, found, on, the, interface, ecotone, between, woodlands, and, savannahs, places, near, water, sources, are, preferred, in, southern, africa, populations, tend, to, be, associated, with, colophospermum, mopane, and, acacia, woodlands, habitat, choices, differ, seasonally, acacia, senegal, woodlands, are, preferred, in, the, wet, season, and, a, drepanolobium, savannahs, in, the, dry, season, another, factor, that, could, influence, habitat, choice, is, vulnerability, to, predators, impala, tend, to, keep, away, from, areas, with, tall, grasses, as, predators, could, be, concealed, there, a, study, found, that, the, reduction, of, woodland, cover, and, creation, of, shrublands, by, the, african, bush, elephants, has, favoured, impala, population, by, increasing, the, availability, of, more, dry, season, browse, earlier, the, baikiaea, woodland, which, has, now, declined, due, to, elephants, provided, minimum, browsing, for, impala, the, newly, formed, capparis, shrubland, on, the, other, hand, could, be, a, key, browsing, habitat, impala, are, generally, not, associated, with, montane, habitats, however, in, kwazulu, natal, impala, have, been, recorded, at, altitudes, of, up, to, 1, 400, metres, 4, 600, ft, above, sea, level, the, historical, range, of, the, impala, spanning, across, southern, and, eastern, africa, has, remained, intact, to, a, great, extent, although, it, has, disappeared, from, a, few, places, such, as, burundi, the, range, extends, from, central, and, southern, kenya, and, northeastern, uganda, in, the, east, to, northern, kwazulu, natal, in, the, south, and, westward, up, to, namibia, and, southern, angola, the, black, faced, impala, is, confined, to, southwestern, angola, and, kaokoland, in, northwestern, namibia, the, status, of, this, subspecies, has, not, been, monitored, since, the, 2000s, the, common, impala, has, a, wider, distribution, and, has, been, introduced, in, protected, areas, in, gabon, and, across, southern, africa, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, and, natural, resources, iucn, classifies, the, impala, as, a, species, of, least, concern, overall, the, black, faced, impala, however, is, classified, as, a, vulnerable, species, as, of, 2008, fewer, than, 1, 000, were, estimated, in, the, wild, though, there, are, no, major, threats, to, the, survival, of, the, common, impala, poaching, and, natural, calamities, have, significantly, contributed, to, the, decline, of, the, black, faced, impala, as, of, 2008, the, population, of, the, common, impala, has, been, estimated, at, around, two, million, according, to, some, studies, translocation, of, the, black, faced, impala, can, be, highly, beneficial, in, its, conservation, around, a, quarter, of, the, common, impala, populations, occur, in, protected, areas, such, as, the, okavango, delta, botswana, masai, mara, and, kajiado, kenya, kruger, national, park, south, africa, the, ruaha, and, serengeti, national, parks, and, selous, game, reserve, tanzania, luangwa, valley, zambia, hwange, sebungwe, and, zambezi, valley, zimbabwe, the, rare, black, faced, impala, has, been, introduced, into, private, farms, in, namibia, and, the, etosha, national, park, population, densities, vary, largely, from, place, to, place, from, less, than, one, impala, per, square, kilometre, in, mkomazi, national, park, tanzania, to, as, high, as, 135, per, square, kilometre, near, lake, kariba, zimbabwe
