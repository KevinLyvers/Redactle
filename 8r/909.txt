the, lycophytes, when, broadly, circumscribed, are, a, group, of, vascular, plants, that, include, the, clubmosses, they, are, sometimes, placed, in, a, division, lycopodiophyta, or, lycophyta, or, in, a, subdivision, lycopodiophytina, they, are, one, of, the, oldest, lineages, of, extant, living, vascular, plants, the, group, contains, extinct, plants, that, have, been, dated, from, the, silurian, ca, 425, million, years, ago, lycophytes, were, some, of, the, dominating, plant, species, of, the, carboniferous, period, and, included, the, tree, like, lepidodendrales, some, of, which, grew, over, 40, metres, 130, ft, in, height, although, extant, lycophytes, are, relatively, small, plants, the, scientific, names, and, the, informal, english, names, used, for, this, group, of, plants, are, ambiguous, for, example, lycopodiophyta, and, the, shorter, lycophyta, as, well, as, the, informal, lycophyte, may, be, used, to, include, the, extinct, zosterophylls, or, to, exclude, them, lycophytes, reproduce, by, spores, and, have, alternation, of, generations, in, which, like, other, vascular, plants, the, sporophyte, generation, is, dominant, some, lycophytes, are, homosporous, while, others, are, heterosporous, when, broadly, circumscribed, the, lycophytes, represent, a, line, of, evolution, distinct, from, that, leading, to, all, other, vascular, plants, the, euphyllophytes, such, as, ferns, gymnosperms, and, flowering, plants, they, are, defined, by, two, synapomorphies, lateral, rather, than, terminal, sporangia, often, kidney, shaped, or, reniform, and, exarch, protosteles, in, which, the, protoxylem, is, outside, the, metaxylem, rather, than, vice, versa, the, extinct, zosterophylls, have, at, most, only, flap, like, extensions, of, the, stem, enations, rather, than, leaves, whereas, extant, lycophyte, species, have, microphylls, leaves, that, have, only, a, single, vascular, trace, vein, rather, than, the, much, more, complex, megaphylls, of, other, vascular, plants, the, extinct, genus, asteroxylon, represents, a, transition, between, these, two, groups, it, has, a, vascular, trace, leaving, the, central, protostele, but, this, extends, only, to, the, base, of, the, enation, see, evolution, of, microphylls, zosterophylls, and, extant, lycophytes, are, all, relatively, small, plants, but, some, extinct, species, such, as, the, lepidodendrales, were, tree, like, and, formed, extensive, forests, that, dominated, the, landscape, and, contributed, to, the, formation, of, coal, in, the, broadest, circumscription, of, the, lycophytes, the, group, includes, the, extinct, zosterophylls, as, well, as, the, extant, living, lycophytes, and, their, closest, extinct, relatives, the, names, and, ranks, used, for, this, group, vary, considerably, some, sources, use, the, names, lycopodiophyta, or, the, shorter, lycophyta, to, include, zosterophylls, as, well, as, extant, lycophytes, and, their, closest, extinct, relatives, while, others, use, these, names, to, exclude, zosterophylls, the, name, lycopodiophytina, has, also, been, used, in, the, inclusive, sense, english, names, such, as, lycophyte, lycopodiophyte, or, lycopod, are, similarly, ambiguous, and, may, refer, to, the, broadly, defined, group, or, only, to, the, extant, lycophytes, and, their, closest, extinct, relatives, the, consensus, classification, produced, by, the, pteridophyte, phylogeny, group, classification, in, 2016, ppg, i, places, all, extant, living, lycophytes, in, the, class, lycopodiopsida, there, are, around, 1, 290, to, 1, 340, such, species, for, more, information, on, the, classification, of, extant, lycophytes, see, lycopodiopsida, classification, a, major, cladistic, study, of, land, plants, was, published, in, 1997, by, kenrick, and, crane, in, 2004, crane, et, al, published, some, simplified, cladograms, based, on, a, number, of, figures, in, kenrick, and, crane, 1997, their, cladogram, for, the, lycophytes, is,
