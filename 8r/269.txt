in, biology, translation, is, the, process, in, living, cells, in, which, proteins, are, produced, using, rna, molecules, as, templates, the, generated, protein, is, a, sequence, of, amino, acids, this, sequence, is, determined, by, the, sequence, of, nucleotides, in, the, rna, the, nucleotides, are, considered, three, at, a, time, each, such, triple, results, in, addition, of, one, specific, amino, acid, to, the, protein, being, generated, the, matching, from, nucleotide, triple, to, amino, acid, is, called, the, genetic, code, the, translation, is, performed, by, a, large, complex, of, functional, rna, and, proteins, called, ribosomes, the, entire, process, is, called, gene, expression, in, translation, messenger, rna, mrna, is, decoded, in, a, ribosome, outside, the, nucleus, to, produce, a, specific, amino, acid, chain, or, polypeptide, the, polypeptide, later, folds, into, an, active, protein, and, performs, its, functions, in, the, cell, the, ribosome, facilitates, decoding, by, inducing, the, binding, of, complementary, transfer, rna, trna, anticodon, sequences, to, mrna, codons, the, trnas, carry, specific, amino, acids, that, are, chained, together, into, a, polypeptide, as, the, mrna, passes, through, and, is, read, by, the, ribosome, translation, proceeds, in, three, phases, in, prokaryotes, bacteria, and, archaea, translation, occurs, in, the, cytosol, where, the, large, and, small, subunits, of, the, ribosome, bind, to, the, mrna, in, eukaryotes, translation, occurs, in, the, cytoplasm, or, across, the, membrane, of, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, in, a, process, called, co, translational, translocation, in, co, translational, translocation, the, entire, ribosome, mrna, complex, binds, to, the, outer, membrane, of, the, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, er, and, the, new, protein, is, synthesized, and, released, into, the, er, the, newly, created, polypeptide, can, be, stored, inside, the, er, for, future, vesicle, transport, and, secretion, outside, the, cell, or, immediately, secreted, many, types, of, transcribed, rna, such, as, trna, ribosomal, rna, and, small, nuclear, rna, do, not, undergo, a, translation, into, proteins, several, antibiotics, act, by, inhibiting, translation, these, include, anisomycin, cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin, erythromycin, and, puromycin, prokaryotic, ribosomes, have, a, different, structure, from, that, of, eukaryotic, ribosomes, and, thus, antibiotics, can, specifically, target, bacterial, infections, without, any, harm, to, a, eukaryotic, host, s, cells, the, basic, process, of, protein, production, is, the, addition, of, one, amino, acid, at, a, time, to, the, end, of, a, protein, this, operation, is, performed, by, a, ribosome, a, ribosome, is, made, up, of, two, subunits, a, small, subunit, and, a, large, subunit, these, subunits, come, together, before, the, translation, of, mrna, into, a, protein, to, provide, a, location, for, translation, to, be, carried, out, and, a, polypeptide, to, be, produced, the, choice, of, amino, acid, type, to, add, is, determined, by, a, messenger, rna, mrna, molecule, each, amino, acid, added, is, matched, to, a, three, nucleotide, subsequence, of, the, mrna, for, each, such, triplet, possible, the, corresponding, amino, acid, is, accepted, the, successive, amino, acids, added, to, the, chain, are, matched, to, successive, nucleotide, triplets, in, the, mrna, in, this, way, the, sequence, of, nucleotides, in, the, template, mrna, chain, determines, the, sequence, of, amino, acids, in, the, generated, amino, acid, chain, the, addition, of, an, amino, acid, occurs, at, the, c, terminus, of, the, peptide, thus, translation, is, said, to, be, amine, to, carboxyl, directed, the, mrna, carries, genetic, information, encoded, as, a, ribonucleotide, sequence, from, the, chromosomes, to, the, ribosomes, the, ribonucleotides, are, read, by, translational, machinery, in, a, sequence, of, nucleotide, triplets, called, codons, each, of, those, triplets, codes, for, a, specific, amino, acid, the, ribosome, molecules, translate, this, code, to, a, specific, sequence, of, amino, acids, the, ribosome, is, a, multisubunit, structure, containing, ribosomal, rna, rrna, and, proteins, it, is, the, factory, where, amino, acids, are, assembled, into, proteins, transfer, rnas, trnas, are, small, noncoding, rna, chains, 74, 93, nucleotides, that, transport, amino, acids, to, the, ribosome, the, repertoire, of, trna, genes, varies, widely, between, species, with, some, bacteria, having, between, 20, and, 30, genes, while, complex, eukaryotes, could, have, thousands, trnas, have, a, site, for, amino, acid, attachment, and, a, site, called, an, anticodon, the, anticodon, is, an, rna, triplet, complementary, to, the, mrna, triplet, that, codes, for, their, cargo, amino, acid, aminoacyl, trna, synthetases, enzymes, catalyze, the, bonding, between, specific, trnas, and, the, amino, acids, that, their, anticodon, sequences, call, for, the, product, of, this, reaction, is, an, aminoacyl, trna, the, amino, acid, is, joined, by, its, carboxyl, group, to, the, 3, oh, of, the, trna, by, an, ester, bond, when, the, trna, has, an, amino, acid, linked, to, it, the, trna, is, termed, charged, in, bacteria, this, aminoacyl, trna, is, carried, to, the, ribosome, by, ef, tu, where, mrna, codons, are, matched, through, complementary, base, pairing, to, specific, trna, anticodons, aminoacyl, trna, synthetases, that, mispair, trnas, with, the, wrong, amino, acids, can, produce, mischarged, aminoacyl, trnas, which, can, result, in, inappropriate, amino, acids, at, the, respective, position, in, the, protein, this, mistranslation, of, the, genetic, code, naturally, occurs, at, low, levels, in, most, organisms, but, certain, cellular, environments, cause, an, increase, in, permissive, mrna, decoding, sometimes, to, the, benefit, of, the, cell, the, ribosome, has, two, binding, sites, for, trna, they, are, the, aminoacyl, site, abbreviated, a, and, the, peptidyl, site, exit, site, abbreviated, p, e, concerning, the, mrna, the, three, sites, are, oriented, 5, to, 3, e, p, a, because, ribosomes, move, toward, the, 3, end, of, mrna, the, a, site, binds, the, incoming, trna, with, the, complementary, codon, on, the, mrna, the, p, e, site, holds, the, trna, with, the, growing, polypeptide, chain, when, an, aminoacyl, trna, initially, binds, to, its, corresponding, codon, on, the, mrna, it, is, in, the, a, site, then, a, peptide, bond, forms, between, the, amino, acid, of, the, trna, in, the, a, site, and, the, amino, acid, of, the, charged, trna, in, the, p, e, site, the, growing, polypeptide, chain, is, transferred, to, the, trna, in, the, a, site, translocation, occurs, moving, the, trna, to, the, p, e, site, now, without, an, amino, acid, the, trna, that, was, in, the, a, site, now, charged, with, the, polypeptide, chain, is, moved, to, the, p, e, site, and, the, uncharged, trna, leaves, and, another, aminoacyl, trna, enters, the, a, site, to, repeat, the, process, after, the, new, amino, acid, is, added, to, the, chain, and, after, the, trna, is, released, out, of, the, ribosome, and, into, the, cytosol, the, energy, provided, by, the, hydrolysis, of, a, gtp, bound, to, the, translocase, ef, g, in, bacteria, and, a, eef, 2, in, eukaryotes, and, archaea, moves, the, ribosome, down, one, codon, towards, the, 3, end, the, energy, required, for, translation, of, proteins, is, significant, for, a, protein, containing, n, amino, acids, the, number, of, high, energy, phosphate, bonds, required, to, translate, it, is, 4, n, 1, the, rate, of, translation, varies, it, is, significantly, higher, in, prokaryotic, cells, up, to, 17, 21, amino, acid, residues, per, second, than, in, eukaryotic, cells, up, to, 6, 9, amino, acid, residues, per, second, initiation, involves, the, small, subunit, of, the, ribosome, binding, to, the, 5, end, of, mrna, with, the, help, of, initiation, factors, if, in, bacteria, and, a, minority, of, archaea, initiation, of, protein, synthesis, involves, the, recognition, of, a, purine, rich, initiation, sequence, on, the, mrna, called, the, shine, dalgarno, sequence, the, shine, dalgarno, sequence, binds, to, a, complementary, pyrimidine, rich, sequence, on, the, 3, end, of, the, 16s, rrna, part, of, the, 30s, ribosomal, subunit, the, binding, of, these, complementary, sequences, ensures, that, the, 30s, ribosomal, subunit, is, bound, to, the, mrna, and, is, aligned, such, that, the, initiation, codon, is, placed, in, the, 30s, portion, of, the, p, site, once, the, mrna, and, 30s, subunit, are, properly, bound, an, initiation, factor, brings, the, initiator, trna, amino, acid, complex, f, met, trna, to, the, 30s, p, site, the, initiation, phase, is, completed, once, a, 50s, subunit, joins, the, 30s, subunit, forming, an, active, 70s, ribosome, termination, of, the, polypeptide, occurs, when, the, a, site, of, the, ribosome, is, occupied, by, a, stop, codon, uaa, uag, or, uga, on, the, mrna, creating, the, primary, structure, of, a, protein, trna, usually, cannot, recognize, or, bind, to, stop, codons, instead, the, stop, codon, induces, the, binding, of, a, release, factor, protein, rf1, rf2, that, prompts, the, disassembly, of, the, entire, ribosome, mrna, complex, by, the, hydrolysis, of, the, polypeptide, chain, from, the, peptidyl, transferase, center, of, the, ribosome, drugs, or, special, sequence, motifs, on, the, mrna, can, change, the, ribosomal, structure, so, that, near, cognate, trnas, are, bound, to, the, stop, codon, instead, of, the, release, factors, in, such, cases, of, translational, readthrough, translation, continues, until, the, ribosome, encounters, the, next, stop, codon, even, though, the, ribosomes, are, usually, considered, accurate, and, processive, machines, the, translation, process, is, subject, to, errors, that, can, lead, either, to, the, synthesis, of, erroneous, proteins, or, to, the, premature, abandonment, of, translation, either, because, a, trna, couples, to, a, wrong, codon, or, because, a, trna, is, coupled, to, the, wrong, amino, acid, the, rate, of, error, in, synthesizing, proteins, has, been, estimated, to, be, between, 1, in, 10, 5, and, 1, in, 10, 3, misincorporated, amino, acids, depending, on, the, experimental, conditions, the, rate, of, premature, translation, abandonment, instead, has, been, estimated, to, be, of, the, order, of, magnitude, of, 10, 4, events, per, translated, codon, the, process, of, translation, is, highly, regulated, in, both, eukaryotic, and, prokaryotic, organisms, regulation, of, translation, can, impact, the, global, rate, of, protein, synthesis, which, is, closely, coupled, to, the, metabolic, and, proliferative, state, of, a, cell, to, delve, deeper, into, this, intricate, process, scientists, typically, use, a, technique, known, as, ribosome, profiling, this, method, enables, researchers, to, take, a, snapshot, of, the, translatome, showing, which, parts, of, the, mrna, are, being, translated, into, proteins, by, ribosomes, at, a, given, time, ribosome, profiling, provides, valuable, insights, into, translation, dynamics, revealing, the, complex, interplay, between, gene, sequence, mrna, structure, and, translation, regulation, for, example, research, utilizing, this, method, has, revealed, that, genetic, differences, and, their, subsequent, expression, as, mrnas, can, also, impact, translation, rate, in, an, rna, specific, manner, expanding, on, this, concept, a, more, recent, development, is, single, cell, ribosome, profiling, a, technique, that, allows, us, to, study, the, translation, process, at, the, resolution, of, individual, cells, this, is, particularly, significant, as, cells, even, those, of, the, same, type, can, exhibit, considerable, variability, in, their, protein, synthesis, single, cell, ribosome, profiling, has, the, potential, to, shed, light, on, the, heterogeneous, nature, of, cells, leading, to, a, more, nuanced, understanding, of, how, translation, regulation, can, impact, cell, behavior, metabolic, state, and, responsiveness, to, various, stimuli, or, conditions, translational, control, is, critical, for, the, development, and, survival, of, cancer, cancer, cells, must, frequently, regulate, the, translation, phase, of, gene, expression, though, it, is, not, fully, understood, why, translation, is, targeted, over, steps, like, transcription, while, cancer, cells, often, have, genetically, altered, translation, factors, it, is, much, more, common, for, cancer, cells, to, modify, the, levels, of, existing, translation, factors, several, major, oncogenic, signaling, pathways, including, the, ras, mapk, pi3k, akt, mtor, myc, and, wnt, catenin, pathways, ultimately, reprogram, the, genome, via, translation, cancer, cells, also, control, translation, to, adapt, to, cellular, stress, during, stress, the, cell, translates, mrnas, that, can, mitigate, the, stress, and, promote, survival, an, example, of, this, is, the, expression, of, ampk, in, various, cancers, its, activation, triggers, a, cascade, that, can, ultimately, allow, the, cancer, to, escape, apoptosis, programmed, cell, death, triggered, by, nutrition, deprivation, future, cancer, therapies, may, involve, disrupting, the, translation, machinery, of, the, cell, to, counter, the, downstream, effects, of, cancer, the, transcription, translation, process, description, mentioning, only, the, most, basic, elementary, processes, consists, of, the, process, of, amino, acid, building, to, create, protein, in, translation, is, a, subject, of, various, physic, models, for, a, long, time, starting, from, the, first, detailed, kinetic, models, such, as, or, others, taking, into, account, stochastic, aspects, of, translation, and, using, computer, simulations, many, chemical, kinetics, based, models, of, protein, synthesis, have, been, developed, and, analyzed, in, the, last, four, decades, beyond, chemical, kinetics, various, modeling, formalisms, such, as, totally, asymmetric, simple, exclusion, process, probabilistic, boolean, networks, petri, nets, and, max, plus, algebra, have, been, applied, to, model, the, detailed, kinetics, of, protein, synthesis, or, some, of, its, stages, a, basic, model, of, protein, synthesis, that, takes, into, account, all, eight, elementary, processes, has, been, developed, following, the, paradigm, that, useful, models, are, simple, and, extendable, the, simplest, model, m0, is, represented, by, the, reaction, kinetic, mechanism, figure, m0, it, was, generalised, to, include, 40s, 60s, and, initiation, factors, if, binding, figure, m1, it, was, extended, further, to, include, effect, of, microrna, on, protein, synthesis, most, of, models, in, this, hierarchy, can, be, solved, analytically, these, solutions, were, used, to, extract, kinetic, signatures, of, different, specific, mechanisms, of, synthesis, regulation, it, is, also, possible, to, translate, either, by, hand, for, short, sequences, or, by, computer, after, first, programming, one, appropriately, see, section, below, this, allows, biologists, and, chemists, to, draw, out, the, chemical, structure, of, the, encoded, protein, on, paper, first, convert, each, template, dna, base, to, its, rna, complement, note, that, the, complement, of, a, is, now, u, as, shown, below, note, that, the, template, strand, of, the, dna, is, the, one, the, rna, is, polymerized, against, the, other, dna, strand, would, be, the, same, as, the, rna, but, with, thymine, instead, of, uracil, then, split, the, rna, into, triplets, groups, of, three, bases, note, that, there, are, 3, translation, windows, or, reading, frames, depending, on, where, you, start, reading, the, code, finally, use, the, table, at, genetic, code, to, translate, the, above, into, a, structural, formula, as, used, in, chemistry, this, will, give, the, primary, structure, of, the, protein, however, proteins, tend, to, fold, depending, in, part, on, hydrophilic, and, hydrophobic, segments, along, the, chain, secondary, structure, can, often, still, be, guessed, at, but, the, proper, tertiary, structure, is, often, very, hard, to, determine, whereas, other, aspects, such, as, the, 3d, structure, called, tertiary, structure, of, protein, can, only, be, predicted, using, sophisticated, algorithms, the, amino, acid, sequence, called, primary, structure, can, be, determined, solely, from, the, nucleic, acid, sequence, with, the, aid, of, a, translation, table, this, approach, may, not, give, the, correct, amino, acid, composition, of, the, protein, in, particular, if, unconventional, amino, acids, such, as, selenocysteine, are, incorporated, into, the, protein, which, is, coded, for, by, a, conventional, stop, codon, in, combination, with, a, downstream, hairpin, selenocysteine, insertion, sequence, or, secis, there, are, many, computer, programs, capable, of, translating, a, dna, rna, sequence, into, a, protein, sequence, normally, this, is, performed, using, the, standard, genetic, code, however, few, programs, can, handle, all, the, special, cases, such, as, the, use, of, the, alternative, initiation, codons, which, are, biologically, significant, for, instance, the, rare, alternative, start, codon, ctg, codes, for, methionine, when, used, as, a, start, codon, and, for, leucine, in, all, other, positions, example, condensed, translation, table, for, the, standard, genetic, code, from, the, ncbi, taxonomy, webpage, the, starts, row, indicate, three, start, codons, uug, cug, and, the, very, common, aug, it, also, indicates, the, first, amino, acid, residue, when, interpreted, as, a, start, in, this, case, it, is, all, methionine, even, when, working, with, ordinary, eukaryotic, sequences, such, as, the, yeast, genome, it, is, often, desired, to, be, able, to, use, alternative, translation, tables, namely, for, translation, of, the, mitochondrial, genes, currently, the, following, translation, tables, are, defined, by, the, ncbi, taxonomy, group, for, the, translation, of, the, sequences, in, genbank
