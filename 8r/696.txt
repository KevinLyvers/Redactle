tapping, sound, of, a, woodpecker, woodpeckers, are, part, of, the, bird, family, picidae, which, also, includes, the, piculets, wrynecks, and, sapsuckers, members, of, this, family, are, found, worldwide, except, for, australia, new, guinea, new, zealand, madagascar, and, the, extreme, polar, regions, most, species, live, in, forests, or, woodland, habitats, although, a, few, species, are, known, that, live, in, treeless, areas, such, as, rocky, hillsides, and, deserts, and, the, gila, woodpecker, specialises, in, exploiting, cacti, members, of, this, family, are, chiefly, known, for, their, characteristic, behaviour, they, mostly, forage, for, insect, prey, on, the, trunks, and, branches, of, trees, and, often, communicate, by, drumming, with, their, beaks, producing, a, reverberatory, sound, that, can, be, heard, at, some, distance, some, species, vary, their, diet, with, fruits, birds, eggs, small, animals, tree, sap, human, scraps, and, carrion, they, usually, nest, and, roost, in, holes, that, they, excavate, in, tree, trunks, and, their, abandoned, holes, are, of, importance, to, other, cavity, nesting, birds, they, sometimes, come, into, conflict, with, humans, when, they, make, holes, in, buildings, or, feed, on, fruit, crops, but, perform, a, useful, service, by, their, removal, of, insect, pests, on, trees, the, picidae, are, one, of, nine, living, families, in, the, order, piciformes, the, others, being, barbets, comprising, three, families, toucans, toucan, barbets, and, honeyguides, which, along, with, woodpeckers, comprise, the, clade, pici, and, the, jacamars, and, puffbirds, in, the, clade, galbuli, dna, sequencing, has, confirmed, the, sister, relationships, of, these, two, groups, the, family, picidae, includes, about, 240, species, arranged, in, 35, genera, almost, 20, species, are, threatened, with, extinction, due, to, loss, of, habitat, or, habitat, fragmentation, with, one, the, bermuda, flicker, being, extinct, and, a, further, two, possibly, being, so, woodpeckers, include, the, tiny, piculets, the, smallest, of, which, appears, to, be, the, bar, breasted, piculet, at, 7, 5, cm, 3, 0, in, in, length, and, a, weight, of, 8, 9, g, 0, 31, oz, some, of, the, largest, woodpeckers, can, be, more, than, 50, cm, 20, in, in, length, the, largest, surviving, species, is, the, great, slaty, woodpecker, which, weighs, 430, g, 15, oz, on, average, and, up, to, 563, g, 19, 9, oz, and, measures, 45, to, 55, cm, 18, to, 22, in, but, the, extinct, imperial, woodpecker, at, 55, to, 61, cm, 22, to, 24, in, and, ivory, billed, woodpecker, around, 48, to, 53, cm, 19, to, 21, in, and, 516, g, 18, 2, oz, were, probably, both, larger, the, plumage, of, woodpeckers, varies, from, drab, to, conspicuous, the, colours, of, many, species, are, based, on, olive, and, brown, and, some, are, pied, suggesting, a, need, for, camouflage, others, are, boldly, patterned, in, black, white, and, red, and, many, have, a, crest, or, tufted, feathers, on, their, crowns, woodpeckers, tend, to, be, sexually, dimorphic, but, differences, between, the, sexes, are, generally, small, exceptions, to, this, are, williamson, s, sapsucker, and, the, orange, backed, woodpecker, which, differ, markedly, the, plumage, is, moulted, fully, once, a, year, apart, from, the, wrynecks, which, have, an, additional, partial, moult, before, breeding, woodpeckers, piculets, and, wrynecks, all, possess, characteristic, zygodactyl, feet, consisting, of, four, toes, the, first, hallux, and, the, fourth, facing, backward, and, the, second, and, third, facing, forward, this, foot, arrangement, is, good, for, grasping, the, limbs, and, trunks, of, trees, members, of, this, family, can, walk, vertically, up, tree, trunks, which, is, beneficial, for, activities, such, as, foraging, for, food, or, nest, excavation, in, addition, to, their, strong, claws, and, feet, woodpeckers, have, short, strong, legs, this, is, typical, of, birds, that, regularly, forage, on, trunks, exceptions, are, the, black, backed, woodpecker, and, the, american, and, eurasian, three, toed, woodpeckers, which, have, only, three, toes, on, each, foot, the, tails, of, all, woodpeckers, except, the, piculets, and, wrynecks, are, stiffened, and, when, the, bird, perches, on, a, vertical, surface, the, tail, and, feet, work, together, to, support, it, woodpeckers, have, strong, bills, that, they, use, for, drilling, and, drumming, on, trees, and, long, sticky, tongues, for, extracting, food, insects, and, larvae, woodpecker, bills, are, typically, longer, sharper, and, stronger, than, the, bills, of, piculets, and, wrynecks, but, their, morphology, is, very, similar, the, bill, s, chisel, like, tip, is, kept, sharp, by, the, pecking, action, in, birds, that, regularly, use, it, on, wood, the, beak, consists, of, three, layers, an, outer, sheath, called, rhamphotheca, made, of, scales, formed, from, keratin, proteins, an, inner, layer, of, bone, which, has, a, large, cavity, and, mineralised, collagen, fibers, and, a, middle, layer, made, of, porous, bone, which, connects, the, two, other, layers, furthermore, the, tongue, bone, or, hyoid, bone, of, the, woodpecker, is, very, long, and, winds, around, the, skull, through, a, special, cavity, thereby, cushioning, the, brain, combined, this, anatomy, helps, the, beak, absorb, mechanical, stress, species, of, woodpecker, and, flicker, that, use, their, bills, in, soil, or, for, probing, as, opposed, to, regular, hammering, tend, to, have, longer, and, more, decurved, bills, due, to, their, smaller, bill, size, many, piculets, and, wrynecks, forage, in, decaying, wood, more, often, than, woodpeckers, their, long, sticky, tongues, which, possess, barbs, aid, these, birds, in, grabbing, and, extracting, insects, from, deep, within, a, hole, in, a, tree, the, tongue, was, reported, to, be, used, to, spear, grubs, but, more, detailed, studies, published, in, 2004, have, shown, that, the, tongue, instead, wraps, around, the, prey, before, being, pulled, out, many, of, the, foraging, breeding, and, signaling, behaviors, of, woodpeckers, involve, drumming, and, hammering, using, their, bills, to, prevent, brain, damage, from, the, rapid, and, repeated, powerful, impacts, woodpeckers, have, a, number, of, physical, features, that, protect, their, brains, these, include, a, relatively, small, and, smooth, brain, narrow, subdural, space, little, cerebrospinal, fluid, surrounding, it, to, prevent, it, from, moving, back, and, forth, inside, the, skull, during, pecking, the, orientation, of, the, brain, within, the, skull, which, maximises, the, contact, area, between, the, brain, and, the, skull, and, the, short, duration, of, contact, the, skull, consists, of, strong, but, compressible, sponge, like, bone, which, is, most, concentrated, in, the, forehead, and, the, back, of, the, skull, another, anatomical, adaptation, of, woodpeckers, is, the, enormously, elongated, hyoid, bone, which, subdivides, passes, on, either, side, of, the, spinal, column, and, wraps, around, the, brain, case, before, ending, in, the, right, nostril, cavity, it, plays, the, role, of, safety, belt, computer, simulations, have, shown, that, 99, 7, of, the, energy, generated, in, pecking, is, stored, in, the, form, of, strain, energy, which, is, distributed, throughout, the, bird, s, body, with, only, a, small, remaining, fraction, of, the, energy, going, into, the, brain, the, pecking, also, causes, the, woodpecker, s, skull, to, heat, up, which, is, part, of, the, reason, why, they, often, peck, in, short, bursts, with, brief, breaks, in, between, giving, the, head, some, time, to, cool, during, the, millisecond, before, contact, with, wood, a, thickened, nictitating, membrane, closes, protecting, the, eye, from, flying, debris, these, membranes, also, prevent, the, retina, from, tearing, their, nostrils, are, also, protected, they, are, often, slit, like, and, have, special, feathers, to, cover, them, woodpeckers, are, capable, of, repeated, pecking, on, a, tree, at, high, decelerations, on, the, order, of, 10, 000, m, s, 2, 33, 000, ft, s, 2, 1000, g, some, large, woodpeckers, such, as, dryocopus, have, a, fast, direct, form, of, flight, but, the, majority, of, species, have, a, typical, undulating, flight, pattern, consisting, of, a, series, of, rapid, flaps, followed, by, a, swooping, glide, many, birds, in, the, genus, melanerpes, have, distinctive, rowing, wing, strokes, while, the, piculets, engage, in, short, bursts, of, rapid, direct, flight, woodpeckers, have, a, mostly, cosmopolitan, distribution, although, they, are, absent, from, australasia, madagascar, and, antarctica, they, are, also, absent, from, some, of, the, world, s, oceanic, islands, although, many, insular, species, are, found, on, continental, islands, the, true, woodpeckers, subfamily, picinae, are, distributed, across, the, entire, range, of, the, family, the, picumninae, piculets, have, a, pantropical, distribution, with, species, in, southeast, asia, africa, and, the, neotropics, with, the, greatest, diversity, being, in, south, america, the, second, piculet, subfamily, the, sasiinae, contains, the, african, piculet, and, two, species, in, the, genus, sasia, that, are, found, in, southeast, asia, the, wrynecks, jynginae, are, found, exclusively, in, the, old, world, with, the, two, species, occurring, in, europe, asia, and, africa, most, woodpeckers, are, sedentary, but, a, few, examples, of, migratory, species, are, known, such, as, the, rufous, bellied, woodpecker, yellow, bellied, sapsucker, and, eurasian, wryneck, which, breeds, in, europe, and, west, asia, and, migrates, to, the, sahel, in, africa, in, the, winter, more, northerly, populations, of, lewis, s, woodpecker, northern, flicker, williamson, s, sapsucker, red, breasted, sapsucker, and, red, naped, sapsucker, all, move, southwards, in, the, fall, in, north, america, most, woodpecker, movements, can, be, described, as, dispersive, such, as, when, young, birds, seek, territories, after, fledging, or, eruptive, to, escape, harsh, weather, conditions, several, species, are, altitudinal, migrants, for, example, the, grey, capped, pygmy, woodpecker, which, moves, to, lowlands, from, hills, during, winter, the, woodpeckers, that, do, migrate, do, so, during, the, day, overall, woodpeckers, are, arboreal, birds, of, wooded, habitats, they, reach, their, greatest, diversity, in, tropical, rainforests, but, occur, in, almost, all, suitable, habitats, including, woodlands, savannahs, scrublands, and, bamboo, forests, even, grasslands, and, deserts, have, been, colonised, by, various, species, these, habitats, are, more, easily, occupied, where, a, small, number, of, trees, exist, or, in, the, case, of, desert, species, like, the, gila, woodpecker, tall, cacti, are, available, for, nesting, some, are, specialists, and, are, associated, with, coniferous, or, deciduous, woodlands, or, even, like, the, acorn, woodpecker, with, individual, tree, genera, oaks, in, this, case, other, species, are, generalists, and, are, able, to, adapt, to, forest, clearance, by, exploiting, secondary, growth, plantations, orchards, and, parks, in, general, forest, dwelling, species, need, rotting, or, dead, wood, on, which, to, forage, several, species, are, adapted, to, spending, a, portion, of, their, time, feeding, on, the, ground, and, a, very, small, minority, have, abandoned, trees, entirely, and, nest, in, holes, in, the, ground, the, ground, woodpecker, is, one, such, species, inhabiting, the, rocky, and, grassy, hills, of, south, africa, and, the, andean, flicker, is, another, the, swiss, ornithological, institute, has, set, up, a, monitoring, program, to, record, breeding, populations, of, woodland, birds, this, has, shown, that, deadwood, is, an, important, habitat, requirement, for, the, black, woodpecker, great, spotted, woodpecker, middle, spotted, woodpecker, lesser, spotted, woodpecker, european, green, woodpecker, and, eurasian, three, toed, woodpecker, populations, of, all, these, species, increased, by, varying, amounts, from, 1990, to, 2008, during, this, period, the, amount, of, deadwood, in, the, forest, increased, and, the, range, of, the, white, backed, woodpecker, enlarged, as, it, extended, eastwards, with, the, exception, of, the, green, and, middle, spotted, woodpeckers, the, increase, in, the, amount, of, deadwood, is, likely, to, be, the, major, factor, explaining, the, population, increase, of, these, species, most, woodpeckers, live, solitary, lives, but, their, behavior, ranges, from, highly, antisocial, species, that, are, aggressive, towards, their, own, kind, to, species, that, live, in, groups, solitary, species, defend, such, feeding, resources, as, a, termite, colony, or, fruit, laden, tree, driving, away, other, conspecifics, and, returning, frequently, until, the, resource, is, exhausted, aggressive, behaviors, include, bill, pointing, and, jabbing, head, shaking, wing, flicking, chasing, drumming, and, vocalizations, ritual, actions, do, not, usually, result, in, contact, and, birds, may, freeze, for, a, while, before, they, resume, their, dispute, the, colored, patches, may, be, flouted, and, in, some, instances, these, antagonistic, behaviors, resemble, courtship, rituals, group, living, species, tend, to, be, communal, group, breeders, in, addition, to, these, species, a, number, of, species, may, join, mixed, species, foraging, flocks, with, other, insectivorous, birds, although, they, tend, to, stay, at, the, edges, of, these, groups, joining, these, flocks, allows, woodpeckers, to, decrease, their, anti, predator, vigilance, and, increase, their, feeding, rate, woodpeckers, are, diurnal, roosting, at, night, inside, holes, and, crevices, in, many, species, the, roost, will, become, the, nest, site, during, the, breeding, season, but, in, some, species, they, have, separate, functions, the, grey, and, buff, woodpecker, makes, several, shallow, holes, for, roosting, which, are, quite, distinct, from, its, nesting, site, most, birds, roost, alone, and, will, oust, intruders, from, their, chosen, site, but, the, magellanic, woodpecker, and, acorn, woodpecker, are, cooperative, roosters, drumming, is, a, form, of, nonvocal, communication, used, by, most, species, of, woodpeckers, and, involves, the, bill, being, repeatedly, struck, on, a, hard, surface, with, great, rapidity, after, a, pause, the, drum, roll, is, repeated, with, each, species, having, a, pattern, that, is, unique, in, the, number, of, beats, in, the, roll, the, length, of, the, roll, the, length, of, the, gap, between, rolls, and, the, cadence, the, drumming, is, mainly, a, territorial, call, equivalent, to, the, song, of, a, passerine, woodpeckers, choose, a, surface, that, resonates, such, as, a, hollow, tree, and, may, use, man, made, structures, such, as, gutters, and, downpipes, drumming, serves, for, the, mutual, recognition, of, conspecifics, and, plays, a, part, in, courtship, rituals, individual, birds, are, thought, to, be, able, to, distinguish, the, drumming, of, their, mates, and, those, of, their, neighbors, drumming, can, be, reliably, used, to, distinguish, between, multiple, species, in, a, region, even, if, those, species, are, phenotypically, similar, cadence, or, the, mean, number, of, drum, beats, per, second, is, heavily, conserved, within, species, comparative, analyses, within, species, between, distant, geographic, populations, have, shown, that, cadence, is, heavily, conserved, across, species, respective, ranges, indicating, that, there, likely, are, not, dialects, as, seen, in, passerine, song, drumming, in, woodpeckers, is, controlled, by, a, set, of, nuclei, in, the, forebrain, that, closely, resemble, the, brain, regions, that, underlie, song, learning, and, production, in, many, songbirds, a, 2023, study, revealed, a, strong, association, between, extractive, foraging, and, relative, brain, size, across, the, family, picidae, indicating, that, a, larger, brain, does, not, necessarily, result, in, more, powerful, drumming, abilities, but, is, implicated, in, foraging, behaviors, as, the, act, of, sensing, and, retrieving, wood, boring, larvae, from, woody, substrates, likely, requires, an, increase, in, sensory, and, motor, control, capabilities, woodpeckers, do, not, have, such, a, wide, range, of, songs, and, calls, as, do, passerine, birds, and, the, sounds, they, make, tend, to, be, simpler, in, structure, calls, produced, include, brief, high, pitched, notes, trills, rattles, twittering, whistling, chattering, nasal, churrs, screams, and, wails, these, calls, are, used, by, both, sexes, in, communication, and, are, related, to, the, circumstances, of, the, occasion, these, include, courtship, territorial, disputes, and, alarm, calls, each, species, has, its, own, range, of, calls, which, tend, to, be, in, the, 1, 0, to, 2, 5, khz, range, for, efficient, transmission, through, forested, environments, mated, couples, may, exchange, muted, low, pitched, calls, and, nestlings, often, issue, noisy, begging, calls, from, inside, their, nest, cavity, the, wrynecks, have, a, more, musical, song, and, in, some, areas, the, song, of, the, newly, arrived, eurasian, wryneck, is, considered, to, be, the, harbinger, of, spring, the, piculets, either, have, a, song, consisting, of, a, long, descending, trill, or, a, descending, series, of, two, to, six, sometimes, more, individual, notes, and, this, song, alerts, ornithologists, to, the, presence, of, the, birds, as, they, are, easily, overlooked, most, woodpecker, species, feed, on, insects, and, other, invertebrates, living, under, bark, and, in, wood, but, overall, the, family, is, characterized, by, its, dietary, flexibility, with, many, species, being, both, highly, omnivorous, and, opportunistic, the, diet, includes, ants, termites, beetles, and, their, larvae, caterpillars, spiders, other, arthropods, bird, eggs, nestlings, small, rodents, lizards, fruit, nuts, and, sap, many, insects, and, their, grubs, are, taken, from, living, and, dead, trees, by, excavation, the, bird, may, hear, sounds, from, inside, the, timber, indicating, where, creating, a, hole, would, be, productive, crustaceans, molluscs, and, carrion, may, be, eaten, by, some, species, including, the, great, spotted, woodpecker, and, bird, feeders, are, visited, for, suet, and, domestic, scraps, other, means, are, also, used, to, garner, prey, some, species, such, as, the, red, naped, sapsucker, sally, into, the, air, to, catch, flying, insects, and, many, species, probe, into, crevices, and, under, bark, or, glean, prey, from, leaves, and, twigs, the, rufous, woodpecker, specialises, in, attacking, the, nests, of, arboreal, ants, and, the, buff, spotted, woodpecker, feeds, on, and, nests, in, termite, mounds, other, species, such, as, the, wrynecks, and, the, andean, flicker, feed, wholly, or, partly, on, the, ground, ecologically, woodpeckers, help, to, keep, trees, healthy, by, keeping, them, from, suffering, mass, infestations, the, family, is, noted, for, its, ability, to, acquire, wood, boring, grubs, from, the, trunks, and, branches, whether, the, timber, is, alive, or, dead, having, hammered, a, hole, into, the, wood, the, prey, is, extracted, by, use, of, a, long, barbed, tongue, woodpeckers, consume, beetles, that, burrow, into, trees, removing, as, many, as, 85, of, emerald, ash, borer, larvae, from, individual, ash, trees, the, ability, to, excavate, allows, woodpeckers, to, obtain, tree, sap, an, important, source, of, food, for, some, species, most, famously, the, sapsuckers, genus, sphyrapicus, feed, in, this, fashion, but, the, technique, is, not, restricted, to, these, and, others, such, as, the, acorn, woodpecker, and, white, headed, woodpecker, also, feed, on, sap, the, technique, was, once, thought, to, be, restricted, to, the, new, world, but, old, world, species, such, as, the, arabian, woodpecker, and, great, spotted, woodpecker, also, feed, in, this, way, all, members, of, the, family, picidae, nest, in, cavities, nearly, always, in, the, trunks, and, branches, of, trees, well, away, from, the, foliage, where, possible, an, area, of, rotten, wood, surrounded, by, sound, timber, is, used, where, trees, are, in, short, supply, the, gilded, flicker, and, ladder, backed, woodpecker, excavate, holes, in, cactus, and, the, andean, flicker, and, ground, woodpecker, dig, holes, in, earth, banks, the, campo, flicker, sometimes, chooses, termite, mounds, the, rufous, woodpecker, prefers, to, use, ants, nests, in, trees, and, the, bamboo, woodpecker, specialises, in, bamboos, woodpeckers, also, excavate, nest, holes, in, residential, and, commercial, structures, and, wooden, utility, poles, woodpeckers, and, piculets, excavate, their, own, nests, but, wrynecks, do, not, and, need, to, find, pre, existing, cavities, a, typical, nest, has, a, round, entrance, hole, that, just, fits, the, bird, leading, to, an, enlarged, vertical, chamber, below, no, nesting, material, is, used, apart, from, some, wood, chips, produced, during, the, excavation, other, wood, chips, are, liberally, scattered, on, the, ground, thus, providing, visual, evidence, of, the, site, of, the, nest, many, species, of, woodpeckers, excavate, one, hole, per, breeding, season, sometimes, after, multiple, attempts, it, takes, around, a, month, to, finish, the, job, and, abandoned, holes, are, used, by, other, birds, and, mammals, that, are, cavity, nesters, unable, to, excavate, their, own, holes, cavities, are, in, great, demand, for, nesting, by, other, cavity, nesters, so, woodpeckers, face, competition, for, the, nesting, sites, they, excavate, from, the, moment, the, hole, becomes, usable, this, may, come, from, other, species, of, woodpecker, or, other, cavity, nesting, birds, such, as, swallows, and, starlings, woodpeckers, may, aggressively, harass, potential, competitors, and, also, use, other, strategies, to, reduce, the, chance, of, being, usurped, from, their, nesting, sites, for, example, the, red, crowned, woodpecker, digs, its, nest, in, the, underside, of, a, small, branch, which, reduces, the, chance, that, a, larger, species, will, take, it, over, and, expand, it, members, of, picidae, are, typically, monogamous, with, a, few, species, breeding, cooperatively, and, some, polygamy, reported, in, a, few, others, polyandry, where, a, female, raises, two, broods, with, two, separate, males, has, also, been, reported, in, the, west, indian, woodpecker, another, unusual, social, system, is, that, of, the, acorn, woodpecker, which, is, a, polygynandrous, cooperative, breeder, where, groups, of, up, to, 12, individuals, breed, and, help, to, raise, the, young, young, birds, from, previous, years, may, stay, behind, to, help, raise, the, group, s, young, and, studies, have, found, reproductive, success, for, the, group, goes, up, with, group, size, but, individual, success, goes, down, birds, may, be, forced, to, remain, in, groups, due, to, a, lack, of, habitat, to, which, to, disperse, a, pair, works, together, to, help, build, the, nest, incubate, the, eggs, and, raise, their, altricial, young, in, most, species, though, the, male, does, most, of, the, nest, excavation, and, takes, the, night, shift, while, incubating, the, eggs, a, clutch, usually, consists, of, two, to, five, round, white, eggs, since, these, birds, are, cavity, nesters, their, eggs, do, not, need, to, be, camouflaged, and, the, white, color, helps, the, parents, to, see, them, in, dim, light, the, eggs, are, incubated, for, about, 11, 14, days, before, they, hatch, about, 18, 30, days, are, then, needed, before, the, chicks, are, fully, fledged, and, ready, to, leave, the, nest, in, most, species, soon, after, this, the, young, are, left, to, fend, for, themselves, exceptions, being, the, various, social, species, and, the, hispaniolan, woodpecker, where, adults, continue, to, feed, their, young, for, several, months, in, general, cavity, nesting, is, a, successful, strategy, and, a, higher, proportion, of, young, is, reared, than, is, the, case, with, birds, that, nest, in, the, open, in, africa, several, species, of, honeyguide, are, brood, parasites, of, woodpeckers, the, picidae, are, just, one, of, nine, living, families, in, the, order, piciformes, other, members, of, this, group, such, as, the, jacamars, puffbirds, barbets, toucans, and, honeyguides, have, traditionally, been, thought, to, be, closely, related, to, the, woodpecker, family, true, woodpeckers, piculets, wrynecks, and, sapsuckers, the, clade, pici, woodpeckers, barbets, toucans, and, honeyguides, is, well, supported, and, shares, a, zygodactyl, foot, with, the, galbuli, puffbirds, and, jacamars, more, recently, several, dna, sequence, analyses, have, confirmed, that, pici, and, galbuli, are, sister, groups, the, phylogenetic, relationship, between, the, woodpeckers, and, the, eight, other, families, in, the, order, piciformes, is, shown, in, the, cladogram, below, the, number, of, species, in, each, family, is, taken, from, the, list, maintained, by, frank, gill, pamela, c, rasmussen, and, david, donsker, on, behalf, of, the, international, ornithological, committee, ioc, galbulidae, jacamars, 18, species, bucconidae, puffbirds, 38, species, indicatoridae, honeyguides, 16, species, picidae, woodpeckers, 240, species, megalaimidae, asian, barbets, 35,

for, the, family, was, introduced, by, english, zoologist, william, elford, leach, in, a, guide, to, the, contents, of, the, british, museum, published, in, 1819, the, phylogeny, has, been, updated, according, to, new, knowledge, about, convergence, patterns, and, evolutionary, history, most, notably, the, relationship, of, the, picinae, genera, has, been, largely, clarified, and, the, antillean, piculet, was, found, to, be, a, surviving, offshoot, of, protowoodpeckers, genetic, analysis, supports, the, monophyly, of, the, picidae, which, seem, to, have, originated, in, the, old, world, but, the, geographic, origins, of, the, picinae, is, unclear, the, picumninae, are, returned, as, paraphyletic, morphological, and, behavioural, characters, in, addition, to, dna, evidence, highlights, genus, hemicircus, as, the, sister, group, of, all, remaining, true, woodpeckers, besides, a, sister, group, relationship, between, the, true, woodpecker, tribes, dendropicini, and, malarpicini, the, evolutionary, history, of, this, group, is, not, well, documented, but, the, known, fossils, allow, some, preliminary, conclusions, the, earliest, known, modern, picids, were, piculet, like, forms, of, the, late, oligocene, about, 25, million, years, ago, mya, by, that, time, however, the, group, was, already, present, in, the, americas, and, europe, and, they, actually, may, have, evolved, much, earlier, maybe, as, early, as, the, early, eocene, 50, mya, the, modern, subfamilies, appear, to, be, rather, young, by, comparison, until, the, mid, miocene, 10, 15, mya, all, picids, seem, to, have, been, small, or, mid, sized, birds, similar, to, a, mixture, between, a, piculet, and, a, wryneck, a, feather, enclosed, in, fossil, amber, from, the, dominican, republic, dated, to, about, 25, mya, however, seems, to, indicate, that, the, nesoctitinae, were, already, a, distinct, lineage, by, then, stepwise, adaptations, for, drilling, tapping, and, climbing, head, first, on, vertical, surfaces, have, been, suggested, the, last, common, ancestor, of, woodpeckers, picidae, was, incapable, of, climbing, up, tree, trunks, or, excavating, nest, cavities, by, drilling, with, its, beak, the, first, adaptations, for, drilling, including, reinforced, rhamphotheca, frontal, overhang, and, processus, dorsalis, pterygoidei, evolved, in, the, ancestral, lineage, of, piculets, and, true, woodpeckers, additional, adaptations, for, drilling, and, tapping, enlarged, condylus, lateralis, of, the, quadrate, and, fused, lower, mandible, have, evolved, in, the, ancestral, lineage, of, true, woodpeckers, hemicircus, excepting, the, inner, rectrix, pairs, became, stiffened, and, the, pygostyle, lamina, was, enlarged, in, the, ancestral, lineage, of, true, woodpeckers, hemicircus, included, which, facilitated, climbing, head, first, up, tree, limbs, genus, hemicircus, excepting, the, tail, feathers, were, further, transformed, for, specialized, support, the, pygostyle, disc, became, greatly, enlarged, and, the, ectropodactyl, toe, arrangement, evolved, these, latter, characters, may, have, facilitated, enormous, increases, in, body, size, in, some, lineages, prehistoric, representatives, of, the, extant, picidae, genera, are, treated, in, the, genus, articles, an, enigmatic, form, based, on, a, coracoid, found, in, pliocene, deposits, of, new, providence, in, the, bahamas, has, been, described, as, bathoceleus, hyphalus, and, probably, also, is, a, woodpecker, the, following, cladogram, is, based, on, the, comprehensive, molecular, phylogenetic, study, of, the, woodpeckers, published, in, 2017, together, with, the, list, of, bird, species, maintained, by, frank, gill, pamela, rasmussen, and, david, donsker, on, behalf, of, the, international, ornithological, committee, ioc, the, cuban, green, woodpecker, in, the, monotypic, genus, xiphidiopicus, was, not, included, in, the, study, the, relative, positions, of, picumninae, sasiinae, and, picinae, in, the, cladogram, are, uncertain, in, the, 2017, study, the, results, depended, upon, which, of, two, different, statistical, procedures, were, used, to, analyse, the, dna, sequence, data, one, method,

birds, and, fascinating, to, watch, as, they, drum, or, forage, but, their, activities, are, not, universally, appreciated, many, woodpecker, species, are, known, to, excavate, holes, in, buildings, fencing, and, utility, poles, creating, health, and, or, safety, issues, for, affected, structures, such, activity, is, very, difficult, to, discourage, and, can, be, costly, to, repair, woodpeckers, also, drum, on, various, reverberatory, structures, on, buildings, such, as, gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents, and, aluminium, sheeting, drumming, is, a, less, forceful, type, of, pecking, that, serves, to, establish, territory, and, attract, mates, houses, with, shingles, or, wooden, boarding, are, also, attractive, as, possible, nesting, or, roosting, sites, especially, when, close, to, large, trees, or, woodland, several, exploratory, holes, may, be, made, especially, at, the, junctions, of, vertical, boards, or, at, the, corners, of, tongue, and, groove, boarding, the, birds, may, also, drill, holes, in, houses, as, they, forage, for, insect, larvae, and, pupae, hidden, behind, the, woodwork, woodpeckers, sometimes, cause, problems, when, they, raid, fruit, crops, but, their, foraging, activities, are, mostly, beneficial, as, they, control, forest, insect, pests, such, as, the, woodboring, beetles, that, create, galleries, behind, the, bark, and, can, kill, trees, they, also, eat, ants, which, may, be, tending, sap, sucking, pests, such, as, mealybugs, as, is, the, case, with, the, rufous, woodpecker, in, coffee, plantations, in, india, woodpeckers, can, serve, as, indicator, species, demonstrating, the, quality, of, the, habitat, their, hole, making, abilities, make, their, presence, in, an, area, an, important, part, of, the, ecosystem, because, these, cavities, are, used, for, breeding, and, roosting, by, many, bird, species, that, are, unable, to, excavate, their, own, holes, as, well, as, being, used, by, various, mammals, and, invertebrates, the, spongy, bones, of, the, woodpecker, s, skull, and, the, flexibility, of, its, beak, both, of, which, provide, protection, for, the, brain, when, drumming, have, provided, inspiration, to,

resistance, of, this, device, to, damage, 60, fold, the, design, of, protective, helmets, is, another, field, being, influenced, by, the, study, of, woodpeckers, one, of, the, accounts, of, the, founding, of, rome, preserved, in, the, work, known, as, origo, gentis, romanae, unknown, refers, to, a, legend, of, a, woodpecker, bringing, food, to, the, boys, romulus, and, remus, during, the, time, they, were, abandoned, in, the, wild, thus, enabling, them, to, survive, and, play, their, part, in, history, woody, woodpecker, is, an, animated, character, that, appeared, in, theatrical, short, films, produced, between, 1940, and, 1972, the, pok, mon, pikipek, was, introduced, in, the, seventh, generation, games, pok, mon, sun, and, moon, in, addition, to, being, a, visual, homage, to, a, pileated, woodpecker, entries, in, the, game, s, pok, dex, encyclopedia, describes, the, small, flying, type, as, analogous, to, its, real, world, counterpart, its, later, forms, called, evolutions, in, the, series, trumbeak, and, toucannon, resemble, a, honeyguide, and, toucan, respectively, perhaps, as, a, tongue, in, cheek, reference, to, the, phylogenetic, relationship, woodpeckers, share, with, these, piciformes, families, in, a, global, survey, of, the, risk, of, extinction, faced, by, the, various, bird, families, woodpeckers, were, the, only, bird, family, to, have, significantly, fewer, species, at, risk, than, would, be, expected, nevertheless, several, woodpeckers, are, under, threat, as, their, habitats, are, destroyed, being, woodland, birds, deforestation, and, clearance, of, land, for, agriculture, and, other, purposes, can, reduce, populations, dramatically, some, species, adapt, to, living, in, plantations, and, secondary, growth, or, to, open, countryside, with, forest, remnants, and, scattered, trees, but, some, do, not, a, few, species, have, even, flourished, when, they, have, adapted, to, man, made, habitats, there, are, few, conservation, projects, directed, primarily, at, woodpeckers, but, they, benefit, whenever, their, habitat, is, conserved, the, red, cockaded, woodpecker, has, been, the, focus, of, much, conservation, effort, in, the, southeastern, united, states, with, artificial, cavities, being, constructed, in, the, longleaf, pines, they, favour, as, nesting, sites, two, species, of, woodpeckers, in, the, americas, the, ivory, billed, woodpecker, is, critically, endangered, and, the, imperial, woodpecker, is, classified, as, extinct, in, the, wild, with, some, authorities, believing, them, extinct, though, possible, but, disputed, ongoing, sightings, of, ivory, billed, woodpeckers, have, been, made, in, the, united, states, and, a, small, population, may, survive, in, cuba, a, critically, endangered, species, is, the, okinawa, woodpecker, from, japan, with, a, single, declining, population, of, a, few, hundred, birds, it, is, threatened, by, deforestation, golf, course, dam, and, helipad, construction, road, building, and, agricultural, development, woodpeckers, possess, many, sophisticated, shock, absorption, mechanisms, that, help, protect, them, from, head, injury, micro, ct, scans, show, that, plate, like, spongy, bones, are, in, the, skull, with, an, uneven, distribution, highly, accumulated, in, the, forehead, and, occiput, but, not, in, other, regions, along, with, the, long, hyoid, bone, safety, belt, the, woodpecker, has, uneven, beak, lengths, which, drastically, reduce, strains, when, compared, to, equal, length, models, have, shown, that, pecking, force, is, changed, to, strain, energy, and, stored, into, the, body, at, around, 99, absorption, while, 1, is, in, the, head, the, head, also, has, many, factors, that, reduce, strain, to, the, brain, and, small, portions, of, energy, are, dissipated, into, the, form, of, heat, therefore, the, pecks, are, always, intermittent, others, dispute, shock, absorption, in, the, head, which, reduces, the, force, of, pecking, but, instead, point, to, adaptations, within, the, brain, itself, tau, protein, accumulation, is, associated, with, chronic, traumatic, encephalopathy, cte, and, thus, has, been, studied, in, sports, where, athletes, suffer, repeated, concussions, tau, is, important, as, it, helps, hold, together, and, stabilize, brain, neurons, woodpeckers, brains, share, similarities, to, humans, with, cte, showing, most, build, up, in, the, frontal, and, temporal, lobes, of, the, brain, it, is, not, yet, known, whether, these, accumulations, are, pathological, or, the, result, of, behavioral, changes, more, research, is, being, done, on, the, subject, and, the, woodpecker, is, a, suitable, animal, model, to, study, the, orientation, of, the, brain, within, the, skull, increases, the, area, of, contact, when, pecking, to, reduce, stress, on, the, brain, and, their, small, size, helps, given, the, acceleration, speeds, straight, line, trajectory, was, theorized, to, be, the, reason, why, woodpeckers, do, not, injure, themselves, since, centripetal, forces, were, the, cause, of, concussion, but, they, do, not, always, peck, in, straight, lines, so, they, produce, and, resist, centripetal, forces, laboratory, tests, show, that, the, woodpeckers, cranial, bone, produces, a, significantly, higher, young, s, modulus, and, ultimate, strength, scores, compared, to, other, birds, its, size, the, cranial, bone, has, a, high, bone, mineral, density, with, plate, like, structures, that, are, thick, with, high, numbers, of, trabeculae, that, are, spaced, closely, together, which, all, may, lead, to, lower, deformation, while, pecking, the, jaw, apparatus, was, studied, looking, into, its, cushioning, effects, when, comparing, the, same, impact, to, the, beak, and, to, the, forehead, the, forehead, experiences, an, impact, force, 1, 72, times, that, of, the, beak, due, to, the, contact, time, being, 3, 25, ms, in, the, forehead, and, 4, 9, ms, in, the, beak, this, is, impulse, momentum, where, impulse, is, the, integral, of, force, over, time, the, quadrate, bone, and, joints, play, an, important, role, in, extending, impact, time, which, decreases, impact, load, to, brain, tissue, bio, inspired, honeycomb, sandwich, beams, are, inspired, by, the, woodpecker, s, skull, design, this, beam, s, goal, is, to, withstand, continuous, impacts, without, the, need, of, replacement, the, bhsb, is, composed, of, carbon, fiber, reinforced, plastic, cfrp, this, is, to, mimic, the, high, strength, beak, next, is, a, rubber, layer, core, for, the, hyoid, bone, for, absorbing, and, spreading, impact, a, second, core, layer, of, aluminum, honeycomb, that, is, porous, and, light, like, the, woodpecker, s, spongey, bone, for, impact, cushioning, the, final, layer, is, the, same, as, the, first, a, cfrp, to, act, as, the, skull, bone, bio, inspired, honeycomb, sandwich, beams, when, compared, to, conventional, beams, reduced, area, damage, by, 50, 80, and, carried, 40, to, 5, of, the, level, of, stresses, in, the, bottom, layer, while, having, an, impact, resistance, efficiency, 1, 65, to, 16, 22, times, higher
