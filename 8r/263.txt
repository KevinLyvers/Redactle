glycolysis, is, the, metabolic, pathway, that, converts, glucose, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, into, pyruvate, and, in, most, organisms, occurs, in, the, liquid, part, of, cells, the, cytosol, the, free, energy, released, in, this, process, is, used, to, form, the, high, energy, molecules, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, and, reduced, nicotinamide, adenine, dinucleotide, nadh, glycolysis, is, a, sequence, of, ten, reactions, catalyzed, by, enzymes, the, wide, occurrence, of, glycolysis, in, other, species, indicates, that, it, is, an, ancient, metabolic, pathway, indeed, the, reactions, that, make, up, glycolysis, and, its, parallel, pathway, the, pentose, phosphate, pathway, can, occur, in, the, oxygen, free, conditions, of, the, archean, oceans, also, in, the, absence, of, enzymes, catalyzed, by, metal, ions, meaning, this, is, a, plausible, prebiotic, pathway, for, abiogenesis, the, most, common, type, of, glycolysis, is, the, embden, meyerhof, parnas, emp, pathway, which, was, discovered, by, gustav, embden, otto, meyerhof, and, jakub, karol, parnas, glycolysis, also, refers, to, other, pathways, such, as, the, entner, doudoroff, pathway, and, various, heterofermentative, and, homofermentative, pathways, however, the, discussion, here, will, be, limited, to, the, embden, meyerhof, parnas, pathway, the, glycolysis, pathway, can, be, separated, into, two, phases, the, overall, reaction, of, glycolysis, is, d, glucose, 2, pyruvate, the, use, of, symbols, in, this, equation, makes, it, appear, unbalanced, with, respect, to, oxygen, atoms, hydrogen, atoms, and, charges, atom, balance, is, maintained, by, the, two, phosphate, p, i, groups, charges, are, balanced, by, the, difference, between, adp, and, atp, in, the, cellular, environment, all, three, hydroxyl, groups, of, adp, dissociate, into, o, and, h, giving, adp, 3, and, this, ion, tends, to, exist, in, an, ionic, bond, with, mg, 2, giving, adpmg, atp, behaves, identically, except, that, it, has, four, hydroxyl, groups, giving, atpmg, 2, when, these, differences, along, with, the, true, charges, on, the, two, phosphate, groups, are, considered, together, the, net, charges, of, 4, on, each, side, are, balanced, for, simple, fermentations, the, metabolism, of, one, molecule, of, glucose, to, two, molecules, of, pyruvate, has, a, net, yield, of, two, molecules, of, atp, most, cells, will, then, carry, out, further, reactions, to, repay, the, used, nad, and, produce, a, final, product, of, ethanol, or, lactic, acid, many, bacteria, use, inorganic, compounds, as, hydrogen, acceptors, to, regenerate, the, nad, cells, performing, aerobic, respiration, synthesize, much, more, atp, but, not, as, part, of, glycolysis, these, further, aerobic, reactions, use, pyruvate, and, nadh, h, from, glycolysis, eukaryotic, aerobic, respiration, produces, approximately, 34, additional, molecules, of, atp, for, each, glucose, molecule, however, most, of, these, are, produced, by, a, mechanism, vastly, different, from, the, substrate, level, phosphorylation, in, glycolysis, the, lower, energy, production, per, glucose, of, anaerobic, respiration, relative, to, aerobic, respiration, results, in, greater, flux, through, the, pathway, under, hypoxic, low, oxygen, conditions, unless, alternative, sources, of, anaerobically, oxidizable, substrates, such, as, fatty, acids, are, found, the, pathway, of, glycolysis, as, it, is, known, today, took, almost, 100, years, to, fully, elucidate, the, combined, results, of, many, smaller, experiments, were, required, in, order, to, understand, the, intricacies, of, the, entire, pathway, the, first, steps, in, understanding, glycolysis, began, in, the, nineteenth, century, with, the, wine, industry, for, economic, reasons, the, french, wine, industry, sought, to, investigate, why, wine, sometimes, turned, distasteful, instead, of, fermenting, into, alcohol, french, scientist, louis, pasteur, researched, this, issue, during, the, 1850s, and, the, results, of, his, experiments, began, the, long, road, to, elucidating, the, pathway, of, glycolysis, his, experiments, showed, that, fermentation, occurs, by, the, action, of, living, microorganisms, yeasts, and, that, yeast, s, glucose, consumption, decreased, under, aerobic, conditions, of, fermentation, in, comparison, to, anaerobic, conditions, the, pasteur, effect, insight, into, the, component, steps, of, glycolysis, were, provided, by, the, non, cellular, fermentation, experiments, of, eduard, buchner, during, the, 1890s, buchner, demonstrated, that, the, conversion, of, glucose, to, ethanol, was, possible, using, a, non, living, extract, of, yeast, due, to, the, action, of, enzymes, in, the, extract, 135, 148, this, experiment, not, only, revolutionized, biochemistry, but, also, allowed, later, scientists, to, analyze, this, pathway, in, a, more, controlled, laboratory, setting, in, a, series, of, experiments, 1905, 1911, scientists, arthur, harden, and, william, young, discovered, more, pieces, of, glycolysis, they, discovered, the, regulatory, effects, of, atp, on, glucose, consumption, during, alcohol, fermentation, they, also, shed, light, on, the, role, of, one, compound, as, a, glycolysis, intermediate, fructose, 1, 6, bisphosphate, 151, 158, the, elucidation, of, fructose, 1, 6, bisphosphate, was, accomplished, by, measuring, co, 2, levels, when, yeast, juice, was, incubated, with, glucose, co, 2, production, increased, rapidly, then, slowed, down, harden, and, young, noted, that, this, process, would, restart, if, an, inorganic, phosphate, pi, was, added, to, the, mixture, harden, and, young, deduced, that, this, process, produced, organic, phosphate, esters, and, further, experiments, allowed, them, to, extract, fructose, diphosphate, f, 1, 6, dp, arthur, harden, and, william, young, along, with, nick, sheppard, determined, in, a, second, experiment, that, a, heat, sensitive, high, molecular, weight, subcellular, fraction, the, enzymes, and, a, heat, insensitive, low, molecular, weight, cytoplasm, fraction, adp, atp, and, nad, and, other, cofactors, are, required, together, for, fermentation, to, proceed, this, experiment, begun, by, observing, that, dialyzed, purified, yeast, juice, could, not, ferment, or, even, create, a, sugar, phosphate, this, mixture, was, rescued, with, the, addition, of, undialyzed, yeast, extract, that, had, been, boiled, boiling, the, yeast, extract, renders, all, proteins, inactive, as, it, denatures, them, the, ability, of, boiled, extract, plus, dialyzed, juice, to, complete, fermentation, suggests, that, the, cofactors, were, non, protein, in, character, in, the, 1920s, otto, meyerhof, was, able, to, link, together, some, of, the, many, individual, pieces, of, glycolysis, discovered, by, buchner, harden, and, young, meyerhof, and, his, team, were, able, to, extract, different, glycolytic, enzymes, from, muscle, tissue, and, combine, them, to, artificially, create, the, pathway, from, glycogen, to, lactic, acid, in, one, paper, meyerhof, and, scientist, renate, junowicz, kockolaty, investigated, the, reaction, that, splits, fructose, 1, 6, diphosphate, into, the, two, triose, phosphates, previous, work, proposed, that, the, split, occurred, via, 1, 3, diphosphoglyceraldehyde, plus, an, oxidizing, enzyme, and, cozymase, meyerhoff, and, junowicz, found, that, the, equilibrium, constant, for, the, isomerase, and, aldoses, reaction, were, not, affected, by, inorganic, phosphates, or, any, other, cozymase, or, oxidizing, enzymes, they, further, removed, diphosphoglyceraldehyde, as, a, possible, intermediate, in, glycolysis, with, all, of, these, pieces, available, by, the, 1930s, gustav, embden, proposed, a, detailed, step, by, step, outline, of, that, pathway, we, now, know, as, glycolysis, the, biggest, difficulties, in, determining, the, intricacies, of, the, pathway, were, due, to, the, very, short, lifetime, and, low, steady, state, concentrations, of, the, intermediates, of, the, fast, glycolytic, reactions, by, the, 1940s, meyerhof, embden, and, many, other, biochemists, had, finally, completed, the, puzzle, of, glycolysis, the, understanding, of, the, isolated, pathway, has, been, expanded, in, the, subsequent, decades, to, include, further, details, of, its, regulation, and, integration, with, other, metabolic, pathways, glucose, hexokinase, glucose, 6, phosphate, glucose, 6, phosphate, isomerase, fructose, 6, phosphate, phosphofructokinase, 1, fructose, 1, 6, bisphosphate, fructose, bisphosphate, aldolase, dihydroxyacetone, phosphate, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, triosephosphate, isomerase, 2, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, dehydrogenase, 2, 1, 3, bisphosphoglycerate, phosphoglycerate, kinase, 2, 3, phosphoglycerate, phosphoglycerate, mutase, 2, 2, phosphoglycerate, phosphopyruvate, hydratase, enolase, 2, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, kinase, 2, pyruvate, the, first, five, steps, of, glycolysis, are, regarded, as, the, preparatory, or, investment, phase, since, they, consume, energy, to, convert, the, glucose, into, two, three, carbon, sugar, phosphates, g3p, once, glucose, enters, the, cell, the, first, step, is, phosphorylation, of, glucose, by, a, family, of, enzymes, called, hexokinases, to, form, glucose, 6, phosphate, g6p, this, reaction, consumes, atp, but, it, acts, to, keep, the, glucose, concentration, inside, the, cell, low, promoting, continuous, transport, of, blood, glucose, into, the, cell, through, the, plasma, membrane, transporters, in, addition, phosphorylation, blocks, the, glucose, from, leaking, out, the, cell, lacks, transporters, for, g6p, and, free, diffusion, out, of, the, cell, is, prevented, due, to, the, charged, nature, of, g6p, glucose, may, alternatively, be, formed, from, the, phosphorolysis, or, hydrolysis, of, intracellular, starch, or, glycogen, in, animals, an, isozyme, of, hexokinase, called, glucokinase, is, also, used, in, the, liver, which, has, a, much, lower, affinity, for, glucose, k, m, in, the, vicinity, of, normal, glycemia, and, differs, in, regulatory, properties, the, different, substrate, affinity, and, alternate, regulation, of, this, enzyme, are, a, reflection, of, the, role, of, the, liver, in, maintaining, blood, sugar, levels, cofactors, mg, 2, g6p, is, then, rearranged, into, fructose, 6, phosphate, f6p, by, glucose, phosphate, isomerase, fructose, can, also, enter, the, glycolytic, pathway, by, phosphorylation, at, this, point, the, change, in, structure, is, an, isomerization, in, which, the, g6p, has, been, converted, to, f6p, the, reaction, requires, an, enzyme, phosphoglucose, isomerase, to, proceed, this, reaction, is, freely, reversible, under, normal, cell, conditions, however, it, is, often, driven, forward, because, of, a, low, concentration, of, f6p, which, is, constantly, consumed, during, the, next, step, of, glycolysis, under, conditions, of, high, f6p, concentration, this, reaction, readily, runs, in, reverse, this, phenomenon, can, be, explained, through, le, chatelier, s, principle, isomerization, to, a, keto, sugar, is, necessary, for, carbanion, stabilization, in, the, fourth, reaction, step, below, the, energy, expenditure, of, another, atp, in, this, step, is, justified, in, 2, ways, the, glycolytic, process, up, to, this, step, becomes, irreversible, and, the, energy, supplied, destabilizes, the, molecule, because, the, reaction, catalyzed, by, phosphofructokinase, 1, pfk, 1, is, coupled, to, the, hydrolysis, of, atp, an, energetically, favorable, step, it, is, in, essence, irreversible, and, a, different, pathway, must, be, used, to, do, the, reverse, conversion, during, gluconeogenesis, this, makes, the, reaction, a, key, regulatory, point, see, below, furthermore, the, second, phosphorylation, event, is, necessary, to, allow, the, formation, of, two, charged, groups, rather, than, only, one, in, the, subsequent, step, of, glycolysis, ensuring, the, prevention, of, free, diffusion, of, substrates, out, of, the, cell, the, same, reaction, can, also, be, catalyzed, by, pyrophosphate, dependent, phosphofructokinase, pfp, or, ppi, pfk, which, is, found, in, most, plants, some, bacteria, archea, and, protists, but, not, in, animals, this, enzyme, uses, pyrophosphate, ppi, as, a, phosphate, donor, instead, of, atp, it, is, a, reversible, reaction, increasing, the, flexibility, of, glycolytic, metabolism, a, rarer, adp, dependent, pfk, enzyme, variant, has, been, identified, in, archaean, species, cofactors, mg, 2, destabilizing, the, molecule, in, the, previous, reaction, allows, the, hexose, ring, to, be, split, by, aldolase, into, two, triose, sugars, dihydroxyacetone, phosphate, a, ketose, and, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, an, aldose, there, are, two, classes, of, aldolases, class, i, aldolases, present, in, animals, and, plants, and, class, ii, aldolases, present, in, fungi, and, bacteria, the, two, classes, use, different, mechanisms, in, cleaving, the, ketose, ring, electrons, delocalized, in, the, carbon, carbon, bond, cleavage, associate, with, the, alcohol, group, the, resulting, carbanion, is, stabilized, by, the, structure, of, the, carbanion, itself, via, resonance, charge, distribution, and, by, the, presence, of, a, charged, ion, prosthetic, group, triosephosphate, isomerase, rapidly, interconverts, dihydroxyacetone, phosphate, with, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, gadp, that, proceeds, further, into, glycolysis, this, is, advantageous, as, it, directs, dihydroxyacetone, phosphate, down, the, same, pathway, as, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, simplifying, regulation, the, second, half, of, glycolysis, is, known, as, the, pay, off, phase, characterised, by, a, net, gain, of, the, energy, rich, molecules, atp, and, nadh, since, glucose, leads, to, two, triose, sugars, in, the, preparatory, phase, each, reaction, in, the, pay, off, phase, occurs, twice, per, glucose, molecule, this, yields, 2, nadh, molecules, and, 4, atp, molecules, leading, to, a, net, gain, of, 2, nadh, molecules, and, 2, atp, molecules, from, the, glycolytic, pathway, per, glucose, the, aldehyde, groups, of, the, triose, sugars, are, oxidised, and, inorganic, phosphate, is, added, to, them, forming, 1, 3, bisphosphoglycerate, the, hydrogen, is, used, to, reduce, two, molecules, of, nad, a, hydrogen, carrier, to, give, nadh, h, for, each, triose, hydrogen, atom, balance, and, charge, balance, are, both, maintained, because, the, phosphate, p, i, group, actually, exists, in, the, form, of, a, hydrogen, phosphate, anion, hpo, 2, 4, which, dissociates, to, contribute, the, extra, h, ion, and, gives, a, net, charge, of, 3, on, both, sides, here, arsenate, 3, an, anion, akin, to, inorganic, phosphate, may, replace, phosphate, as, a, substrate, to, form, 1, arseno, 3, phosphoglycerate, this, however, is, unstable, and, readily, hydrolyzes, to, form, 3, phosphoglycerate, the, intermediate, in, the, next, step, of, the, pathway, as, a, consequence, of, bypassing, this, step, the, molecule, of, atp, generated, from, 1, 3, bisphosphoglycerate, in, the, next, reaction, will, not, be, made, even, though, the, reaction, proceeds, as, a, result, arsenate, is, an, uncoupler, of, glycolysis, this, step, is, the, enzymatic, transfer, of, a, phosphate, group, from, 1, 3, bisphosphoglycerate, to, adp, by, phosphoglycerate, kinase, forming, atp, and, 3, phosphoglycerate, at, this, step, glycolysis, has, reached, the, break, even, point, 2, molecules, of, atp, were, consumed, and, 2, new, molecules, have, now, been, synthesized, this, step, one, of, the, two, substrate, level, phosphorylation, steps, requires, adp, thus, when, the, cell, has, plenty, of, atp, and, little, adp, this, reaction, does, not, occur, because, atp, decays, relatively, quickly, when, it, is, not, metabolized, this, is, an, important, regulatory, point, in, the, glycolytic, pathway, adp, actually, exists, as, adpmg, and, atp, as, atpmg, 2, balancing, the, charges, at, 5, both, sides, cofactors, mg, 2, phosphoglycerate, mutase, isomerises, 3, phosphoglycerate, into, 2, phosphoglycerate, enolase, next, converts, 2, phosphoglycerate, to, phosphoenolpyruvate, this, reaction, is, an, elimination, reaction, involving, an, e1cb, mechanism, cofactors, 2, mg, 2, one, conformational, ion, to, coordinate, with, the, carboxylate, group, of, the, substrate, and, one, catalytic, ion, that, participates, in, the, dehydration, a, final, substrate, level, phosphorylation, now, forms, a, molecule, of, pyruvate, and, a, molecule, of, atp, by, means, of, the, enzyme, pyruvate, kinase, this, serves, as, an, additional, regulatory, step, similar, to, the, phosphoglycerate, kinase, step, cofactors, mg, 2, the, existence, of, more, than, one, point, of, regulation, indicates, that, intermediates, between, those, points, enter, and, leave, the, glycolysis, pathway, by, other, processes, for, example, in, the, first, regulated, step, hexokinase, converts, glucose, into, glucose, 6, phosphate, instead, of, continuing, through, the, glycolysis, pathway, this, intermediate, can, be, converted, into, glucose, storage, molecules, such, as, glycogen, or, starch, the, reverse, reaction, breaking, down, e, g, glycogen, produces, mainly, glucose, 6, phosphate, very, little, free, glucose, is, formed, in, the, reaction, the, glucose, 6, phosphate, so, produced, can, enter, glycolysis, after, the, first, control, point, in, the, second, regulated, step, the, third, step, of, glycolysis, phosphofructokinase, converts, fructose, 6, phosphate, into, fructose, 1, 6, bisphosphate, which, then, is, converted, into, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, and, dihydroxyacetone, phosphate, the, dihydroxyacetone, phosphate, can, be, removed, from, glycolysis, by, conversion, into, glycerol, 3, phosphate, which, can, be, used, to, form, triglycerides, conversely, triglycerides, can, be, broken, down, into, fatty, acids, and, glycerol, the, latter, in, turn, can, be, converted, into, dihydroxyacetone, phosphate, which, can, enter, glycolysis, after, the, second, control, point, the, change, in, free, energy, g, for, each, step, in, the, glycolysis, pathway, can, be, calculated, using, g, g, rt, ln, q, where, q, is, the, reaction, quotient, this, requires, knowing, the, concentrations, of, the, metabolites, all, of, these, values, are, available, for, erythrocytes, with, the, exception, of, the, concentrations, of, nad, and, nadh, the, ratio, of, nad, to, nadh, in, the, cytoplasm, is, approximately, 1000, which, makes, the, oxidation, of, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, step, 6, more, favourable, using, the, measured, concentrations, of, each, step, and, the, standard, free, energy, changes, the, actual, free, energy, change, can, be, calculated, neglecting, this, is, very, common, the, delta, g, of, atp, hydrolysis, in, cells, is, not, the, standard, free, energy, change, of, atp, hydrolysis, quoted, in, textbooks, from, measuring, the, physiological, concentrations, of, metabolites, in, an, erythrocyte, it, seems, that, about, seven, of, the, steps, in, glycolysis, are, in, equilibrium, for, that, cell, type, three, of, the, steps, the, ones, with, large, negative, free, energy, changes, are, not, in, equilibrium, and, are, referred, to, as, irreversible, such, steps, are, often, subject, to, regulation, step, 5, in, the, figure, is, shown, behind, the, other, steps, because, that, step, is, a, side, reaction, that, can, decrease, or, increase, the, concentration, of, the, intermediate, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, that, compound, is, converted, to, dihydroxyacetone, phosphate, by, the, enzyme, triose, phosphate, isomerase, which, is, a, catalytically, perfect, enzyme, its, rate, is, so, fast, that, the, reaction, can, be, assumed, to, be, in, equilibrium, the, fact, that, g, is, not, zero, indicates, that, the, actual, concentrations, in, the, erythrocyte, are, not, accurately, known, the, enzymes, that, catalyse, glycolysis, are, regulated, via, a, range, of, biological, mechanisms, in, order, to, control, overall, flux, though, the, pathway, this, is, vital, for, both, homeostatsis, in, a, static, environment, and, metabolic, adaptation, to, a, changing, environment, or, need, the, details, of, regulation, for, some, enzymes, are, highly, conserved, between, species, whereas, others, vary, widely, in, animals, regulation, of, blood, glucose, levels, by, the, pancreas, in, conjunction, with, the, liver, is, a, vital, part, of, homeostasis, the, beta, cells, in, the, pancreatic, islets, are, sensitive, to, the, blood, glucose, concentration, a, rise, in, the, blood, glucose, concentration, causes, them, to, release, insulin, into, the, blood, which, has, an, effect, particularly, on, the, liver, but, also, on, fat, and, muscle, cells, causing, these, tissues, to, remove, glucose, from, the, blood, when, the, blood, sugar, falls, the, pancreatic, beta, cells, cease, insulin, production, but, instead, stimulate, the, neighboring, pancreatic, alpha, cells, to, release, glucagon, into, the, blood, this, in, turn, causes, the, liver, to, release, glucose, into, the, blood, by, breaking, down, stored, glycogen, and, by, means, of, gluconeogenesis, if, the, fall, in, the, blood, glucose, level, is, particularly, rapid, or, severe, other, glucose, sensors, cause, the, release, of, epinephrine, from, the, adrenal, glands, into, the, blood, this, has, the, same, action, as, glucagon, on, glucose, metabolism, but, its, effect, is, more, pronounced, in, the, liver, glucagon, and, epinephrine, cause, the, phosphorylation, of, the, key, regulated, enzymes, of, glycolysis, fatty, acid, synthesis, cholesterol, synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and, glycogenolysis, insulin, has, the, opposite, effect, on, these, enzymes, the, phosphorylation, and, dephosphorylation, of, these, enzymes, ultimately, in, response, to, the, glucose, level, in, the, blood, is, the, dominant, manner, by, which, these, pathways, are, controlled, in, the, liver, fat, and, muscle, cells, thus, the, phosphorylation, of, phosphofructokinase, inhibits, glycolysis, whereas, its, dephosphorylation, through, the, action, of, insulin, stimulates, glycolysis, the, three, regulatory, enzymes, are, hexokinase, or, glucokinase, in, the, liver, phosphofructokinase, and, pyruvate, kinase, the, flux, through, the, glycolytic, pathway, is, adjusted, in, response, to, conditions, both, inside, and, outside, the, cell, the, internal, factors, that, regulate, glycolysis, do, so, primarily, to, provide, atp, in, adequate, quantities, for, the, cell, s, needs, the, external, factors, act, primarily, on, the, liver, fat, tissue, and, muscles, which, can, remove, large, quantities, of, glucose, from, the, blood, after, meals, thus, preventing, hyperglycemia, by, storing, the, excess, glucose, as, fat, or, glycogen, depending, on, the, tissue, type, the, liver, is, also, capable, of, releasing, glucose, into, the, blood, between, meals, during, fasting, and, exercise, thus, preventing, hypoglycemia, by, means, of, glycogenolysis, and, gluconeogenesis, these, latter, reactions, coincide, with, the, halting, of, glycolysis, in, the, liver, in, addition, hexokinase, and, glucokinase, act, independently, of, the, hormonal, effects, as, controls, at, the, entry, points, of, glucose, into, the, cells, of, different, tissues, hexokinase, responds, to, the, glucose, 6, phosphate, g6p, level, in, the, cell, or, in, the, case, of, glucokinase, to, the, blood, sugar, level, in, the, blood, to, impart, entirely, intracellular, controls, of, the, glycolytic, pathway, in, different, tissues, see, below, when, glucose, has, been, converted, into, g6p, by, hexokinase, or, glucokinase, it, can, either, be, converted, to, glucose, 1, phosphate, g1p, for, conversion, to, glycogen, or, it, is, alternatively, converted, by, glycolysis, to, pyruvate, which, enters, the, mitochondrion, where, it, is, converted, into, acetyl, coa, and, then, into, citrate, excess, citrate, is, exported, from, the, mitochondrion, back, into, the, cytosol, where, atp, citrate, lyase, regenerates, acetyl, coa, and, oxaloacetate, oaa, the, acetyl, coa, is, then, used, for, fatty, acid, synthesis, and, cholesterol, synthesis, two, important, ways, of, utilizing, excess, glucose, when, its, concentration, is, high, in, blood, the, regulated, enzymes, catalyzing, these, reactions, perform, these, functions, when, they, have, been, dephosphorylated, through, the, action, of, insulin, on, the, liver, cells, between, meals, during, fasting, exercise, or, hypoglycemia, glucagon, and, epinephrine, are, released, into, the, blood, this, causes, liver, glycogen, to, be, converted, back, to, g6p, and, then, converted, to, glucose, by, the, liver, specific, enzyme, glucose, 6, phosphatase, and, released, into, the, blood, glucagon, and, epinephrine, also, stimulate, gluconeogenesis, which, converts, non, carbohydrate, substrates, into, g6p, which, joins, the, g6p, derived, from, glycogen, or, substitutes, for, it, when, the, liver, glycogen, store, have, been, depleted, this, is, critical, for, brain, function, since, the, brain, utilizes, glucose, as, an, energy, source, under, most, conditions, the, simultaneously, phosphorylation, of, particularly, phosphofructokinase, but, also, to, a, certain, extent, pyruvate, kinase, prevents, glycolysis, occurring, at, the, same, time, as, gluconeogenesis, and, glycogenolysis, all, cells, contain, the, enzyme, hexokinase, which, catalyzes, the, conversion, of, glucose, that, has, entered, the, cell, into, glucose, 6, phosphate, g6p, since, the, cell, membrane, is, impervious, to, g6p, hexokinase, essentially, acts, to, transport, glucose, into, the, cells, from, which, it, can, then, no, longer, escape, hexokinase, is, inhibited, by, high, levels, of, g6p, in, the, cell, thus, the, rate, of, entry, of, glucose, into, cells, partially, depends, on, how, fast, g6p, can, be, disposed, of, by, glycolysis, and, by, glycogen, synthesis, in, the, cells, which, store, glycogen, namely, liver, and, muscles, glucokinase, unlike, hexokinase, is, not, inhibited, by, g6p, it, occurs, in, liver, cells, and, will, only, phosphorylate, the, glucose, entering, the, cell, to, form, g6p, when, the, glucose, in, the, blood, is, abundant, this, being, the, first, step, in, the, glycolytic, pathway, in, the, liver, it, therefore, imparts, an, additional, layer, of, control, of, the, glycolytic, pathway, in, this, organ, phosphofructokinase, is, an, important, control, point, in, the, glycolytic, pathway, since, it, is, one, of, the, irreversible, steps, and, has, key, allosteric, effectors, amp, and, fructose, 2, 6, bisphosphate, f2, 6bp, f2, 6bp, is, a, very, potent, activator, of, phosphofructokinase, pfk, 1, that, is, synthesized, when, f6p, is, phosphorylated, by, a, second, phosphofructokinase, pfk2, in, the, liver, when, blood, sugar, is, low, and, glucagon, elevates, camp, pfk2, is, phosphorylated, by, protein, kinase, a, the, phosphorylation, inactivates, pfk2, and, another, domain, on, this, protein, becomes, active, as, fructose, bisphosphatase, 2, which, converts, f2, 6bp, back, to, f6p, both, glucagon, and, epinephrine, cause, high, levels, of, camp, in, the, liver, the, result, of, lower, levels, of, liver, f2, 6bp, is, a, decrease, in, activity, of, phosphofructokinase, and, an, increase, in, activity, of, fructose, 1, 6, bisphosphatase, so, that, gluconeogenesis, in, essence, glycolysis, in, reverse, is, favored, this, is, consistent, with, the, role, of, the, liver, in, such, situations, since, the, response, of, the, liver, to, these, hormones, is, to, release, glucose, to, the, blood, atp, competes, with, amp, for, the, allosteric, effector, site, on, the, pfk, enzyme, atp, concentrations, in, cells, are, much, higher, than, those, of, amp, typically, 100, fold, higher, but, the, concentration, of, atp, does, not, change, more, than, about, 10, under, physiological, conditions, whereas, a, 10, drop, in, atp, results, in, a, 6, fold, increase, in, amp, thus, the, relevance, of, atp, as, an, allosteric, effector, is, questionable, an, increase, in, amp, is, a, consequence, of, a, decrease, in, energy, charge, in, the, cell, citrate, inhibits, phosphofructokinase, when, tested, in, vitro, by, enhancing, the, inhibitory, effect, of, atp, however, it, is, doubtful, that, this, is, a, meaningful, effect, in, vivo, because, citrate, in, the, cytosol, is, utilized, mainly, for, conversion, to, acetyl, coa, for, fatty, acid, and, cholesterol, synthesis, tigar, a, p53, induced, enzyme, is, responsible, for, the, regulation, of, phosphofructokinase, and, acts, to, protect, against, oxidative, stress, tigar, is, a, single, enzyme, with, dual, function, that, regulates, f2, 6bp, it, can, behave, as, a, phosphatase, fructuose, 2, 6, bisphosphatase, which, cleaves, the, phosphate, at, carbon, 2, producing, f6p, it, can, also, behave, as, a, kinase, pfk2, adding, a, phosphate, onto, carbon, 2, of, f6p, which, produces, f2, 6bp, in, humans, the, tigar, protein, is, encoded, by, c12orf5, gene, the, tigar, enzyme, will, hinder, the, forward, progression, of, glycolysis, by, creating, a, build, up, of, fructose, 6, phosphate, f6p, which, is, isomerized, into, glucose, 6, phosphate, g6p, the, accumulation, of, g6p, will, shunt, carbons, into, the, pentose, phosphate, pathway, the, final, step, of, glycolysis, is, catalysed, by, pyruvate, kinase, to, form, pyruvate, and, another, atp, it, is, regulated, by, a, range, of, different, transcriptional, covalent, and, non, covalent, regulation, mechanisms, which, can, vary, widely, in, different, tissues, for, example, in, the, liver, pyruvate, kinase, is, regulated, based, on, glucose, availability, during, fasting, no, glucose, available, glucagon, activates, protein, kinase, a, which, phosphorylates, pyruvate, kinase, to, inhibit, it, an, increase, in, blood, sugar, leads, to, secretion, of, insulin, which, activates, protein, phosphatase, 1, leading, to, dephosphorylation, and, re, activation, of, pyruvate, kinase, these, controls, prevent, pyruvate, kinase, from, being, active, at, the, same, time, as, the, enzymes, that, catalyze, the, reverse, reaction, pyruvate, carboxylase, and, phosphoenolpyruvate, carboxykinase, preventing, a, futile, cycle, conversely, the, isoform, of, pyruvate, kinasein, found, in, muscle, is, not, affected, by, protein, kinase, a, which, is, activated, by, adrenaline, in, that, tissue, so, that, glycolysis, remains, active, in, muscles, even, during, fasting, the, overall, process, of, glycolysis, is, if, glycolysis, were, to, continue, indefinitely, all, of, the, nad, would, be, used, up, and, glycolysis, would, stop, to, allow, glycolysis, to, continue, organisms, must, be, able, to, oxidize, nadh, back, to, nad, how, this, is, performed, depends, on, which, external, electron, acceptor, is, available, one, method, of, doing, this, is, to, simply, have, the, pyruvate, do, the, oxidation, in, this, process, pyruvate, is, converted, to, lactate, the, conjugate, base, of, lactic, acid, in, a, process, called, lactic, acid, fermentation, this, process, occurs, in, the, bacteria, involved, in, making, yogurt, the, lactic, acid, causes, the, milk, to, curdle, this, process, also, occurs, in, animals, under, hypoxic, or, partially, anaerobic, conditions, found, for, example, in, overworked, muscles, that, are, starved, of, oxygen, in, many, tissues, this, is, a, cellular, last, resort, for, energy, most, animal, tissue, cannot, tolerate, anaerobic, conditions, for, an, extended, period, of, time, some, organisms, such, as, yeast, convert, nadh, back, to, nad, in, a, process, called, ethanol, fermentation, in, this, process, the, pyruvate, is, converted, first, to, acetaldehyde, and, carbon, dioxide, and, then, to, ethanol, lactic, acid, fermentation, and, ethanol, fermentation, can, occur, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, this, anaerobic, fermentation, allows, many, single, cell, organisms, to, use, glycolysis, as, their, only, energy, source, anoxic, regeneration, of, nad, is, only, an, effective, means, of, energy, production, during, short, intense, exercise, in, vertebrates, for, a, period, ranging, from, 10, seconds, to, 2, minutes, during, a, maximal, effort, in, humans, at, lower, exercise, intensities, it, can, sustain, muscle, activity, in, diving, animals, such, as, seals, whales, and, other, aquatic, vertebrates, for, very, much, longer, periods, of, time, under, these, conditions, nad, is, replenished, by, nadh, donating, its, electrons, to, pyruvate, to, form, lactate, this, produces, 2, atp, molecules, per, glucose, molecule, or, about, 5, of, glucose, s, energy, potential, 38, atp, molecules, in, bacteria, but, the, speed, at, which, atp, is, produced, in, this, manner, is, about, 100, times, that, of, oxidative, phosphorylation, the, ph, in, the, cytoplasm, quickly, drops, when, hydrogen, ions, accumulate, in, the, muscle, eventually, inhibiting, the, enzymes, involved, in, glycolysis, the, burning, sensation, in, muscles, during, hard, exercise, can, be, attributed, to, the, release, of, hydrogen, ions, during, the, shift, to, glucose, fermentation, from, glucose, oxidation, to, carbon, dioxide, and, water, when, aerobic, metabolism, can, no, longer, keep, pace, with, the, energy, demands, of, the, muscles, these, hydrogen, ions, form, a, part, of, lactic, acid, the, body, falls, back, on, this, less, efficient, but, faster, method, of, producing, atp, under, low, oxygen, conditions, this, is, thought, to, have, been, the, primary, means, of, energy, production, in, earlier, organisms, before, oxygen, reached, high, concentrations, in, the, atmosphere, between, 2000, and, 2500, million, years, ago, and, thus, would, represent, a, more, ancient, form, of, energy, production, than, the, aerobic, replenishment, of, nad, in, cells, the, liver, in, mammals, gets, rid, of, this, excess, lactate, by, transforming, it, back, into, pyruvate, under, aerobic, conditions, see, cori, cycle, fermentation, of, pyruvate, to, lactate, is, sometimes, also, called, anaerobic, glycolysis, however, glycolysis, ends, with, the, production, of, pyruvate, regardless, of, the, presence, or, absence, of, oxygen, in, the, above, two, examples, of, fermentation, nadh, is, oxidized, by, transferring, two, electrons, to, pyruvate, however, anaerobic, bacteria, use, a, wide, variety, of, compounds, as, the, terminal, electron, acceptors, in, cellular, respiration, nitrogenous, compounds, such, as, nitrates, and, nitrites, sulfur, compounds, such, as, sulfates, sulfites, sulfur, dioxide, and, elemental, sulfur, carbon, dioxide, iron, compounds, manganese, compounds, cobalt, compounds, and, uranium, compounds, in, aerobic, eukaryotes, a, complex, mechanism, has, developed, to, use, the, oxygen, in, air, as, the, final, electron, acceptor, in, a, process, called, oxidative, phosphorylation, aerobic, prokaryotes, which, lack, mitochondria, use, a, variety, of, simpler, mechanisms, the, pyruvate, produced, by, glycolysis, is, an, important, intermediary, in, the, conversion, of, carbohydrates, into, fatty, acids, and, cholesterol, this, occurs, via, the, conversion, of, pyruvate, into, acetyl, coa, in, the, mitochondrion, however, this, acetyl, coa, needs, to, be, transported, into, cytosol, where, the, synthesis, of, fatty, acids, and, cholesterol, occurs, this, cannot, occur, directly, to, obtain, cytosolic, acetyl, coa, citrate, produced, by, the, condensation, of, acetyl, coa, with, oxaloacetate, is, removed, from, the, citric, acid, cycle, and, carried, across, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, into, the, cytosol, there, it, is, cleaved, by, atp, citrate, lyase, into, acetyl, coa, and, oxaloacetate, the, oxaloacetate, is, returned, to, mitochondrion, as, malate, and, then, back, into, oxaloacetate, to, transfer, more, acetyl, coa, out, of, the, mitochondrion, the, cytosolic, acetyl, coa, can, be, carboxylated, by, acetyl, coa, carboxylase, into, malonyl, coa, the, first, committed, step, in, the, synthesis, of, fatty, acids, or, it, can, be, combined, with, acetoacetyl, coa, to, form, 3, hydroxy, 3, methylglutaryl, coa, hmg, coa, which, is, the, rate, limiting, step, controlling, the, synthesis, of, cholesterol, cholesterol, can, be, used, as, is, as, a, structural, component, of, cellular, membranes, or, it, can, be, used, to, synthesize, the, steroid, hormones, bile, salts, and, vitamin, d, pyruvate, molecules, produced, by, glycolysis, are, actively, transported, across, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, and, into, the, matrix, where, they, can, either, be, oxidized, and, combined, with, coenzyme, a, to, form, co, 2, acetyl, coa, and, nadh, or, they, can, be, carboxylated, by, pyruvate, carboxylase, to, form, oxaloacetate, this, latter, reaction, fills, up, the, amount, of, oxaloacetate, in, the, citric, acid, cycle, and, is, therefore, an, anaplerotic, reaction, from, the, greek, meaning, to, fill, up, increasing, the, cycle, s, capacity, to, metabolize, acetyl, coa, when, the, tissue, s, energy, needs, e, g, in, heart, and, skeletal, muscle, are, suddenly, increased, by, activity, in, the, citric, acid, cycle, all, the, intermediates, e, g, citrate, iso, citrate, alpha, ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and, oxaloacetate, are, regenerated, during, each, turn, of, the, cycle, adding, more, of, any, of, these, intermediates, to, the, mitochondrion, therefore, means, that, that, additional, amount, is, retained, within, the, cycle, increasing, all, the, other, intermediates, as, one, is, converted, into, the, other, hence, the, addition, of, oxaloacetate, greatly, increases, the, amounts, of, all, the, citric, acid, intermediates, thereby, increasing, the, cycle, s, capacity, to, metabolize, acetyl, coa, converting, its, acetate, component, into, co, 2, and, water, with, the, release, of, enough, energy, to, form, 11, atp, and, 1, gtp, molecule, for, each, additional, molecule, of, acetyl, coa, that, combines, with, oxaloacetate, in, the, cycle, to, cataplerotically, remove, oxaloacetate, from, the, citric, cycle, malate, can, be, transported, from, the, mitochondrion, into, the, cytoplasm, decreasing, the, amount, of, oxaloacetate, that, can, be, regenerated, furthermore, citric, acid, intermediates, are, constantly, used, to, form, a, variety, of, substances, such, as, the, purines, pyrimidines, and, porphyrins, this, article, concentrates, on, the, catabolic, role, of, glycolysis, with, regard, to, converting, potential, chemical, energy, to, usable, chemical, energy, during, the, oxidation, of, glucose, to, pyruvate, many, of, the, metabolites, in, the, glycolytic, pathway, are, also, used, by, anabolic, pathways, and, as, a, consequence, flux, through, the, pathway, is, critical, to, maintain, a, supply, of, carbon, skeletons, for, biosynthesis, the, following, metabolic, pathways, are, all, strongly, reliant, on, glycolysis, as, a, source, of, metabolites, and, many, more, although, gluconeogenesis, and, glycolysis, share, many, intermediates, the, one, is, not, functionally, a, branch, or, tributary, of, the, other, there, are, two, regulatory, steps, in, both, pathways, which, when, active, in, the, one, pathway, are, automatically, inactive, in, the, other, the, two, processes, can, therefore, not, be, simultaneously, active, indeed, if, both, sets, of, reactions, were, highly, active, at, the, same, time, the, net, result, would, be, the, hydrolysis, of, four, high, energy, phosphate, bonds, two, atp, and, two, gtp, per, reaction, cycle, nad, is, the, oxidizing, agent, in, glycolysis, as, it, is, in, most, other, energy, yielding, metabolic, reactions, e, g, beta, oxidation, of, fatty, acids, and, during, the, citric, acid, cycle, the, nadh, thus, produced, is, primarily, used, to, ultimately, transfer, electrons, to, o, 2, to, produce, water, or, when, o, 2, is, not, available, to, produce, compounds, such, as, lactate, or, ethanol, see, anoxic, regeneration, of, nad, above, nadh, is, rarely, used, for, synthetic, processes, the, notable, exception, being, gluconeogenesis, during, fatty, acid, and, cholesterol, synthesis, the, reducing, agent, is, nadph, this, difference, exemplifies, a, general, principle, that, nadph, is, consumed, during, biosynthetic, reactions, whereas, nadh, is, generated, in, energy, yielding, reactions, the, source, of, the, nadph, is, two, fold, when, malate, is, oxidatively, decarboxylated, by, nadp, linked, malic, enzyme, pyruvate, co, 2, and, nadph, are, formed, nadph, is, also, formed, by, the, pentose, phosphate, pathway, which, converts, glucose, into, ribose, which, can, be, used, in, synthesis, of, nucleotides, and, nucleic, acids, or, it, can, be, catabolized, to, pyruvate, cellular, uptake, of, glucose, occurs, in, response, to, insulin, signals, and, glucose, is, subsequently, broken, down, through, glycolysis, lowering, blood, sugar, levels, however, insulin, resistance, or, low, insulin, levels, seen, in, diabetes, result, in, hyperglycemia, where, glucose, levels, in, the, blood, rise, and, glucose, is, not, properly, taken, up, by, cells, hepatocytes, further, contribute, to, this, hyperglycemia, through, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, in, hepatocytes, controls, hepatic, glucose, production, and, when, glucose, is, overproduced, by, the, liver, without, having, a, means, of, being, broken, down, by, the, body, hyperglycemia, results, glycolytic, mutations, are, generally, rare, due, to, importance, of, the, metabolic, pathway, the, majority, of, occurring, mutations, result, in, an, inability, of, the, cell, to, respire, and, therefore, cause, the, death, of, the, cell, at, an, early, stage, however, some, mutations, glycogen, storage, diseases, and, other, inborn, errors, of, carbohydrate, metabolism, are, seen, with, one, notable, example, being, pyruvate, kinase, deficiency, leading, to, chronic, hemolytic, anemia, in, combined, malonic, and, methylmalonic, aciduria, cmamma, due, to, acsf3, deficiency, glycolysis, is, reduced, by, 50, which, is, caused, by, reduced, lipoylation, of, mitochondrial, enzymes, such, as, the, pyruvate, dehydrogenase, complex, and, ketoglutarate, dehydrogenase, complex, malignant, tumor, cells, perform, glycolysis, at, a, rate, that, is, ten, times, faster, than, their, noncancerous, tissue, counterparts, during, their, genesis, limited, capillary, support, often, results, in, hypoxia, decreased, o2, supply, within, the, tumor, cells, thus, these, cells, rely, on, anaerobic, metabolic, processes, such, as, glycolysis, for, atp, adenosine, triphosphate, some, tumor, cells, overexpress, specific, glycolytic, enzymes, which, result, in, higher, rates, of, glycolysis, often, these, enzymes, are, isoenzymes, of, traditional, glycolysis, enzymes, that, vary, in, their, susceptibility, to, traditional, feedback, inhibition, the, increase, in, glycolytic, activity, ultimately, counteracts, the, effects, of, hypoxia, by, generating, sufficient, atp, from, this, anaerobic, pathway, this, phenomenon, was, first, described, in, 1930, by, otto, warburg, and, is, referred, to, as, the, warburg, effect, the, warburg, hypothesis, claims, that, cancer, is, primarily, caused, by, dysfunctionality, in, mitochondrial, metabolism, rather, than, because, of, the, uncontrolled, growth, of, cells, a, number, of, theories, have, been, advanced, to, explain, the, warburg, effect, one, such, theory, suggests, that, the, increased, glycolysis, is, a, normal, protective, process, of, the, body, and, that, malignant, change, could, be, primarily, caused, by, energy, metabolism, this, high, glycolysis, rate, has, important, medical, applications, as, high, aerobic, glycolysis, by, malignant, tumors, is, utilized, clinically, to, diagnose, and, monitor, treatment, responses, of, cancers, by, imaging, uptake, of, 2, 18, f, 2, deoxyglucose, fdg, a, radioactive, modified, hexokinase, substrate, with, positron, emission, tomography, pet, there, is, ongoing, research, to, affect, mitochondrial, metabolism, and, treat, cancer, by, reducing, glycolysis, and, thus, starving, cancerous, cells, in, various, new, ways, including, a, ketogenic, diet, the, diagram, below, shows, human, protein, names, names, in, other, organisms, may, be, different, and, the, number, of, isozymes, such, as, hk1, hk2, is, likely, to, be, different, too, click, on, genes, proteins, and, metabolites, below, to, link, to, respective, articles, some, of, the, metabolites, in, glycolysis, have, alternative, names, and, nomenclature, in, part, this, is, because, some, of, them, are, common, to, other, pathways, such, as, the, calvin, cycle, the, intermediates, of, glycolysis, depicted, in, fischer, projections, show, the, chemical, changing, step, by, step, such, image, can, be, compared, to, polygonal, model, representation
