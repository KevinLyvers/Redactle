the, fig, is, the, edible, fruit, of, ficus, carica, a, species, of, small, tree, in, the, flowering, plant, family, moraceae, native, to, the, mediterranean, region, together, with, western, and, southern, asia, it, has, been, cultivated, since, ancient, times, and, is, now, widely, grown, throughout, the, world, ficus, carica, is, the, type, species, of, the, genus, ficus, containing, over, 800, tropical, and, subtropical, plant, species, a, fig, plant, is, a, small, deciduous, tree, or, large, shrub, growing, up, to, 7, 10, m, 23, 33, ft, tall, with, smooth, white, bark, its, large, leaves, have, three, to, five, deep, lobes, its, fruit, referred, to, as, syconium, a, type, of, multiple, fruit, is, tear, shaped, 3, 5, cm, 1, 2, in, long, with, a, green, skin, that, may, ripen, toward, purple, or, brown, and, sweet, soft, reddish, flesh, containing, numerous, crunchy, seeds, the, milky, sap, of, the, green, parts, is, an, irritant, to, human, skin, in, the, northern, hemisphere, fresh, figs, are, in, season, from, late, summer, to, early, autumn, they, tolerate, moderate, seasonal, frost, and, can, be, grown, even, in, hot, summer, continental, climates, figs, can, be, eaten, fresh, or, dried, or, processed, into, jam, rolls, biscuits, and, other, types, of, desserts, since, ripe, fruit, does, not, transport, and, keep, well, most, commercial, production, is, in, dried, and, processed, forms, raw, figs, contain, roughly, 80, water, and, 20, carbohydrates, with, negligible, protein, fat, and, micronutrient, content, they, are, a, moderate, source, of, dietary, fiber, in, 2018, world, production, of, raw, figs, was, 1, 14, million, tonnes, led, by, turkey, and, north, african, countries, egypt, morocco, and, algeria, as, the, largest, producers, collectively, accounting, for, 64, of, the, total, the, word, fig, first, recorded, in, english, in, the, 13th, century, derives, from, old, french, figue, itself, from, occitan, proven, al, figa, from, romance, fica, from, classical, latin, ficus, fig, or, fig, tree, italian, has, fico, directly, derived, from, latin, ficus, the, name, of, the, caprifig, ficus, caprificus, risso, is, derived, both, from, latin, caper, genitive, capri, he, goat, and, english, fig, ficus, carica, is, a, gynodioecious, deciduous, tree, or, large, shrub, that, grows, up, to, 7, 10, m, 23, 33, ft, tall, with, smooth, white, bark, its, fragrant, leaves, are, 12, 25, cm, 4, 1, 2, 10, in, long, and, 10, 18, cm, 4, 7, in, wide, and, are, deeply, lobed, three, or, five, lobes, the, fig, fruit, develops, as, a, hollow, fleshy, structure, called, the, syconium, that, is, lined, internally, with, numerous, unisexual, flowers, the, tiny, flowers, bloom, inside, this, cup, like, structure, although, commonly, called, a, fruit, the, syconium, is, botanically, an, infructescence, a, type, of, multiple, fruit, the, small, fig, flowers, and, later, small, single, seeded, true, fruits, line, its, interior, surface, a, small, opening, or, ostiole, visible, on, the, middle, of, the, fruit, is, a, narrow, passage, that, allows, the, specialized, fig, wasp, blastophaga, psenes, to, enter, the, inflorescence, and, pollinate, the, flowers, after, which, each, fertilized, ovule, one, per, flower, in, its, ovary, develops, into, a, seed, at, maturity, these, seeds, actually, single, seeded, fruits, line, the, inside, of, each, fig, the, edible, mature, syconium, develops, into, a, fleshy, false, fruit, bearing, the, numerous, one, seeded, fruits, which, are, technically, drupelets, the, whole, fig, fruit, is, 3, 5, cm, 1, 2, in, long, with, a, green, skin, that, sometimes, ripens, toward, purple, or, brown, ficus, carica, has, milky, sap, produced, by, laticifer, cells, the, sap, of, the, green, parts, is, an, irritant, to, human, skin, the, common, fig, tree, has, been, cultivated, since, ancient, times, and, grows, wild, in, dry, and, sunny, locations, with, deep, and, fresh, soil, and, in, rocky, locations, that, are, at, sea, level, to, 1, 700, metres, in, elevation, it, prefers, relatively, porous, and, freely, draining, soil, and, can, grow, in, nutritionally, poor, soil, unlike, other, fig, species, ficus, carica, does, not, always, require, pollination, by, a, wasp, or, from, another, tree, but, can, be, pollinated, by, the, fig, wasp, blastophaga, psenes, to, produce, seeds, fig, wasps, are, not, present, to, pollinate, in, colder, regions, such, as, the, british, isles, the, species, has, become, naturalized, in, scattered, locations, in, asia, and, north, america, the, plant, tolerates, seasonal, drought, and, the, middle, eastern, and, mediterranean, climates, are, especially, suitable, to, it, situated, in, a, favorable, habitat, mature, specimens, can, grow, to, considerable, size, as, large, dense, shade, trees, its, aggressive, root, system, precludes, its, cultivation, in, many, urban, locations, yet, in, nature, this, characteristic, helps, the, plant, to, root, in, the, most, inhospitable, locations, having, a, great, need, of, water, it, is, mostly, a, phreatophyte, that, extracts, the, needed, water, from, sources, in, or, on, the, ground, consequently, it, frequently, grows, in, locations, with, standing, or, running, water, e, g, in, valleys, of, rivers, and, in, ravines, that, collect, water, the, deeply, rooted, plant, searches, for, groundwater, in, aquifers, ravines, or, cracks, in, rocks, with, access, to, this, water, the, tree, cools, the, hot, environments, in, which, it, grows, thus, producing, fresh, and, pleasant, habitat, for, many, animals, that, shelter, in, its, shade, during, periods, of, intense, heat, the, mountain, or, rock, fig, persian, romanized, anj, r, kuhi, is, a, wild, variety, tolerant, of, cold, dry, climates, of, the, semi, arid, rocky, montane, regions, of, iran, especially, in, the, k, hest, n, mountains, of, khorasan, ficus, carica, is, dispersed, by, birds, and, mammals, that, scatter, their, seeds, in, droppings, fig, fruit, is, an, important, food, source, for, much, of, the, fauna, in, some, areas, and, the, tree, owes, its, expansion, to, those, that, feed, on, its, fruit, the, common, fig, tree, also, sprouts, from, the, root, and, stolon, tissues, the, edible, fig, is, one, of, the, first, plants, that, were, cultivated, by, humans, nine, subfossil, figs, of, a, parthenocarpic, and, therefore, sterile, type, dating, to, about, 9400, 9200, bc, were, found, in, the, early, neolithic, village, gilgal, i, in, the, jordan, valley, 13, km, north, of, jericho, the, find, precedes, the, domestication, of, wheat, barley, and, legumes, and, may, thus, be, the, first, known, instance, of, agriculture, it, is, proposed, that, this, sterile, but, desirable, type, was, planted, and, cultivated, intentionally, one, thousand, years, before, the, next, crops, were, domesticated, wheat, and, rye, in, ancient, palestine, fig, cakes, were, often, produced, from, selected, ripe, figs, figs, were, widespread, in, ancient, greece, and, their, cultivation, was, described, by, both, aristotle, and, theophrastus, aristotle, noted, that, as, in, animal, sexes, figs, have, individuals, of, two, kinds, one, the, cultivated, fig, that, bears, fruit, and, one, the, wild, caprifig, that, assists, the, other, to, bear, fruit, further, aristotle, recorded, that, the, fruits, of, the, wild, fig, contain, psenes, fig, wasps, these, begin, life, as, larvae, and, the, adult, psen, splits, its, skin, pupa, and, flies, out, of, the, fig, to, find, and, enter, a, cultivated, fig, saving, it, from, dropping, theophrastus, observed, that, just, as, date, palms, have, male, and, female, flowers, and, that, farmers, from, the, east, help, by, scattering, dust, from, the, male, onto, the, female, and, as, a, male, fish, releases, his, milt, over, the, female, s, eggs, so, greek, farmers, tie, wild, figs, to, cultivated, trees, they, do, not, say, directly, that, figs, reproduce, sexually, however, figs, were, also, a, common, food, source, for, the, romans, cato, the, elder, in, his, c, 160, bc, de, agri, cultura, lists, several, strains, of, figs, grown, at, the, time, he, wrote, his, handbook, the, mariscan, african, herculanean, saguntine, and, the, black, tellanian, the, fruits, were, used, among, other, things, to, fatten, geese, for, the, production, of, a, precursor, of, foie, gras, rome, s, first, emperor, augustus, was, reputed, to, have, been, poisoned, with, figs, from, his, garden, smeared, with, poison, by, his, wife, livia, for, this, reason, or, perhaps, because, of, her, horticultural, expertise, a, variety, of, fig, known, as, the, liviana, was, cultivated, in, roman, gardens, it, was, cultivated, from, afghanistan, to, portugal, also, grown, in, pithoragarh, in, the, kumaon, hills, of, india, from, the, 15th, century, onwards, it, was, grown, in, areas, including, northern, europe, and, the, new, world, in, the, 16th, century, cardinal, reginald, pole, introduced, fig, trees, to, lambeth, palace, in, london, in, 1769, spanish, missionaries, led, by, junipero, serra, brought, the, first, figs, to, california, the, mission, variety, which, they, cultivated, is, still, popular, the, fact, that, it, is, parthenocarpic, self, pollinating, made, it, an, ideal, cultivar, for, introduction, the, kadota, cultivar, is, even, older, being, mentioned, by, the, roman, naturalist, pliny, the, elder, in, the, 1st, century, a, d, pliny, recorded, thirty, varieties, of, figs, the, name, kadota, name, did, not, exist, in, the, era, of, pliny, the, elder, nor, is, it, mentioned, in, pliny, s, works, also, only, 29, figs, were, recorded, in, his, work, pliny, the, elder, the, natural, history, english, translation, by, john, bostock, and, h, t, riley, book, xv, chap, 19, 18, twenty, nine, varieties, of, the, fig, the, kadota, name, was, created, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, california, usa, to, name, a, sport, or, genetic, deviation, from, a, dotatto, fig, tree, as, documented, in, the, kadota, fig, a, treatise, on, its, origin, planting, and, care, by, w, sam, clark, the, common, fig, is, grown, for, its, edible, fruit, throughout, the, temperate, world, it, is, also, grown, as, an, ornamental, tree, and, in, the, uk, the, cultivars, brown, turkey, and, ice, crystal, mainly, grown, for, its, unusual, foliage, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, figs, are, also, grown, in, germany, mainly, in, private, gardens, inside, built, up, areas, there, is, no, commercial, fig, growing, the, palatine, region, in, the, german, south, west, has, an, estimated, 80, 000, fig, trees, the, variety, brown, turkey, is, the, most, widespread, in, the, region, there, are, about, a, dozen, quite, widespread, varieties, hardy, enough, to, survive, winter, outdoors, mostly, without, special, protection, there, are, even, two, local, varieties, martinsfeige, and, lussheim, which, may, be, the, hardiest, varieties, in, the, region, as, the, population, of, california, grew, especially, after, the, gold, rush, a, number, of, other, cultivars, were, brought, there, by, persons, and, nurserymen, from, the, east, coast, of, the, us, and, from, france, and, england, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, it, became, apparent, that, california, had, the, potential, for, being, an, ideal, fig, producing, state, because, of, its, mediterranean, like, climate, and, latitude, of, 38, degrees, lining, up, san, francisco, with, zmir, turkey, g, p, rixford, first, brought, true, smyrna, figs, to, california, in, 1880, the, most, popular, cultivar, of, smyrna, type, fig, is, calimyrna, being, a, name, that, combines, california, and, smyrna, the, cultivar, however, is, not, one, that, was, produced, by, a, breeding, program, and, instead, is, from, one, of, the, cuttings, brought, to, california, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 19th, century, it, is, identical, to, the, cultivar, lob, injir, that, has, been, grown, in, turkey, for, centuries, figs, can, be, found, in, continental, climates, with, hot, summers, as, far, north, as, hungary, and, moravia, thousands, of, cultivars, most, named, have, been, developed, as, human, migration, brought, the, fig, to, many, places, outside, its, natural, range, fig, plants, can, be, propagated, by, seed, or, by, vegetative, methods, vegetative, propagation, is, quicker, and, more, reliable, as, it, does, not, yield, the, inedible, caprifigs, seeds, germinate, readily, in, moist, conditions, and, grow, rapidly, once, established, for, vegetative, propagation, shoots, with, buds, can, be, planted, in, well, watered, soil, in, the, spring, or, summer, or, a, branch, can, be, scratched, to, expose, the, bast, inner, bark, and, pinned, to, the, ground, to, allow, roots, to, develop, two, crops, of, figs, can, be, produced, each, year, the, first, or, breba, crop, develops, in, the, spring, on, last, year, s, shoot, growth, the, main, fig, crop, develops, on, the, current, year, s, shoot, growth, and, ripens, in, the, late, summer, or, fall, the, main, crop, is, generally, superior, in, quantity, and, quality, but, some, cultivars, such, as, black, mission, croisic, and, ventura, produce, good, breba, crops, there, are, three, types, of, edible, figs, there, are, dozens, of, fig, cultivars, including, main, and, breba, cropping, varieties, and, an, edible, caprifig, the, croisic, varieties, are, often, local, found, in, a, single, region, of, one, country, people, of, the, italian, diaspora, who, live, in, cold, winter, climates, have, the, practice, of, burying, imported, fig, trees, to, overwinter, them, and, protect, the, fruiting, hard, wood, from, cold, italian, immigrants, to, america, in, the, 19th, century, introduced, this, common, practice, in, cities, such, as, new, york, philadelphia, boston, and, toronto, where, winters, are, normally, too, cold, to, leave, the, tree, exposed, this, practice, consists, in, digging, a, trench, that, is, appropriate, to, the, size, of, the, specimen, some, of, which, are, more, than, 10, feet, tall, severing, part, of, the, root, system, and, bending, the, specimen, into, the, trench, specimens, are, often, wrapped, in, waterproof, material, to, discourage, development, of, mould, and, fungus, then, covered, with, a, heavy, layer, of, soil, and, leaves, sometimes, plywood, or, corrugated, metal, is, placed, on, top, to, secure, the, tree, in, borderline, climates, like, new, york, city, burying, trees, is, no, longer, needed, because, low, winter, temperatures, have, increased, often, specimens, are, simply, wrapped, in, plastic, and, other, insulating, material, or, not, protected, if, planted, in, a, sheltered, site, against, a, wall, that, absorbs, sunlight, while, the, fig, contains, more, naturally, occurring, varieties, than, any, other, tree, crop, a, formal, breeding, program, was, not, developed, until, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, ira, condit, high, priest, of, the, fig, and, william, storey, tested, some, thousands, of, fig, seedlings, in, the, early, 20th, century, based, at, university, of, california, riverside, it, was, then, continued, at, the, university, of, california, davis, however, the, fig, breeding, program, was, ultimately, closed, in, the, 1980s, due, to, insect, and, fungal, disease, pressure, in, both, dried, and, fresh, figs, the, breeding, program, was, revived, in, 1989, by, james, doyle, and, louise, ferguson, using, the, germplasm, established, at, uc, riverside, by, ira, condit, and, william, storey, crosses, were, made, and, two, new, varieties, are, now, in, production, in, california, the, public, variety, sierra, and, the, patented, variety, sequoia, in, 2020, world, production, of, raw, figs, was, 1, 26, million, tonnes, led, by, turkey, with, 25, of, the, world, total, egypt, morocco, and, algeria, as, the, largest, producers, collectively, accounting, for, 62, of, the, total, figs, can, be, eaten, fresh, or, dried, and, used, in, jam, making, most, commercial, production, is, in, dried, or, otherwise, processed, forms, since, the, ripe, fruit, does, not, transport, well, and, once, picked, does, not, keep, well, the, widely, produced, fig, roll, fig, newton, is, a, trademark, of, nabisco, is, a, biscuit, or, cookie, with, a, filling, made, from, figs, in, the, northern, hemisphere, fresh, figs, are, in, season, from, august, through, to, early, october, fresh, figs, used, in, cooking, should, be, plump, and, soft, and, without, bruising, or, splits, if, they, smell, sour, the, figs, have, become, over, ripe, slightly, under, ripe, figs, can, be, kept, at, room, temperature, for, 1, 2, days, to, ripen, before, serving, figs, are, most, flavorful, at, room, temperature, freshly, harvested, figs, underwent, two, distinct, drying, methods, for, preservation, the, first, method, was, natural, sun, drying, where, the, figs, were, exposed, to, the, warmth, and, light, of, the, sun, the, second, method, involved, oven, drying, where, the, figs, were, placed, in, a, controlled, temperature, environment, within, an, oven, each, process, has, its, unique, impact, on, the, texture, and, flavor, profile, of, the, dried, figs, raw, figs, are, 79, water, 19, carbohydrates, 1, protein, and, contain, negligible, fat, table, they, are, a, moderate, source, 14, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, dietary, fiber, and, 310, kilojoules, 74, kcal, of, food, energy, per, 100, gram, serving, and, do, not, supply, essential, micronutrients, in, significant, contents, table, when, dehydrated, to, 30, water, figs, have, a, carbohydrate, content, of, 64, protein, content, of, 3, and, fat, content, of, 1, in, a, 100, gram, serving, providing, 1, 041, kj, 249, kcal, of, food, energy, dried, figs, are, a, rich, source, more, than, 20, dv, of, dietary, fiber, and, the, essential, mineral, manganese, 26, dv, while, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, and, vitamin, k, are, in, moderate, amounts, in, fig, fruits, the, levels, of, glucose, and, fructose, are, nearly, identical, with, glucose, being, slightly, more, prevalent, overall, while, the, presence, of, sucrose, is, minimal, still, in, some, varieties, of, figs, the, fructose, content, can, occasionally, slightly, surpass, that, of, glucose, figs, contain, diverse, phytochemicals, under, basic, research, for, their, potential, biological, properties, including, polyphenols, such, as, gallic, acid, chlorogenic, acid, syringic, acid, catechin, epicatechin, and, rutin, fig, color, may, vary, between, cultivars, due, to, various, concentrations, of, anthocyanins, with, cyanidin, 3, o, rutinoside, having, particularly, high, content, in, some, old, mediterranean, folk, practices, the, milky, sap, of, the, fig, plant, was, used, to, soften, calluses, remove, warts, and, deter, parasites, since, the, late, 1800s, syrup, of, figs, combined, with, senna, has, been, available, as, a, laxative, like, other, plant, species, in, the, family, moraceae, contact, with, the, milky, sap, of, ficus, carica, followed, by, exposure, to, ultraviolet, light, can, cause, phytophotodermatitis, a, potentially, serious, skin, inflammation, although, the, plant, is, not, poisonous, per, se, f, carica, is, listed, in, the, fda, database, of, poisonous, plants, organic, chemical, compounds, called, furanocoumarins, are, known, to, cause, phytophotodermatitis, in, humans, the, common, fig, contains, significant, quantities, of, two, furanocoumarins, psoralen, and, bergapten, the, essential, oil, of, fig, leaves, contains, more, than, 10, psoralen, the, highest, concentration, of, any, organic, compound, isolated, from, fig, leaves, psoralen, appears, to, be, the, primary, furanocoumarin, compound, responsible, for, fig, leaf, induced, phytophotodermatitis, psoralen, and, bergapten, are, found, chiefly, in, the, milky, sap, of, the, leaves, and, shoots, of, f, carica, but, not, the, fruits, neither, psoralen, nor, bergapten, were, detected, in, the, essential, oil, of, fig, fruits, thus, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, that, fig, fruits, cause, phytophotodermatitis, babylonian, ishtar, for, example, took, the, form, of, the, divine, fig, tree, xikum, the, primeval, mother, at, the, central, place, of, the, earth, protectress, of, the, saviour, tammuz, moreover, figs, and, the, fig, tree, were, closely, linked, with, female, sexuality, according, to, barbara, walker, s, encyclopedia, on, goddess, symbols, this, may, account, for, the, common, use, of, the, fig, tree, as, a, symbol, of, man, s, enlightenment, which, was, formerly, supposed, to, come, through, his, connection, with, the, female, principle, gautama, buddha, attained, enlightenment, bodhi, after, meditating, underneath, a,
