a, lynx, l, k, s, links, pl, lynx, or, lynxes, is, any, of, the, four, extant, species, the, canada, lynx, iberian, lynx, eurasian, lynx, and, the, bobcat, within, the, medium, sized, wild, cat, genus, lynx, the, name, originated, in, middle, english, via, latin, from, the, greek, word, lynx, derived, from, the, indo, european, root, leuk, light, brightness, in, reference, to, the, luminescence, of, its, reflective, eyes, lynx, have, a, short, tail, characteristic, tufts, of, black, hair, on, the, tips, of, their, ears, large, padded, paws, for, walking, on, snow, and, long, whiskers, on, the, face, under, their, neck, they, have, a, ruff, which, has, black, bars, resembling, a, bow, tie, although, this, is, often, not, visible, body, colour, varies, from, medium, brown, to, goldish, to, beige, white, and, is, occasionally, marked, with, dark, brown, spots, especially, on, the, limbs, all, species, of, lynx, have, white, fur, on, their, chests, bellies, and, on, the, insides, of, their, legs, fur, which, is, an, extension, of, the, chest, and, belly, fur, the, lynx, s, colouring, fur, length, and, paw, size, vary, according, to, the, climate, in, their, range, in, the, southwestern, united, states, they, are, short, haired, dark, in, colour, and, their, paws, are, smaller, and, less, padded, in, colder, northern, climates, lynx, have, thicker, and, lighter, fur, as, well, as, larger, and, more, padded, paws, that, are, well, adapted, to, snow, the, smallest, species, are, the, bobcat, and, the, canada, lynx, while, the, largest, is, the, eurasian, lynx, with, considerable, variations, within, species, the, four, living, species, of, the, genus, lynx, are, believed, to, have, evolved, from, lynx, issiodorensis, which, lived, in, europe, and, africa, during, the, late, pliocene, to, early, pleistocene, the, pliocene, felid, felis, rexroadensis, from, north, america, has, been, proposed, as, an, even, earlier, ancestor, however, this, was, larger, than, any, living, species, and, is, not, currently, classified, as, a, true, lynx, another, extinct, species, of, lynx, l, shansiensis, inhabited, what, is, now, northern, china, during, the, early, pleistocene, of, the, four, lynx, species, the, eurasian, lynx, lynx, lynx, is, the, largest, in, size, it, is, native, to, european, central, asian, and, siberian, forests, while, its, conservation, status, has, been, classified, as, least, concern, populations, of, eurasian, lynx, have, been, reduced, or, extirpated, from, much, of, europe, where, it, is, now, being, reintroduced, during, the, summer, the, eurasian, lynx, has, a, relatively, short, reddish, or, brown, coat, which, is, replaced, by, a, much, thicker, silver, grey, to, greyish, brown, coat, during, winter, the, lynx, hunts, by, stalking, and, jumping, on, its, prey, helped, by, the, rugged, forested, country, in, which, it, resides, a, favorite, prey, for, the, lynx, in, its, woodland, habitat, is, roe, deer, it, will, feed, however, on, whatever, animal, appears, easiest, as, it, is, an, opportunistic, predator, much, like, its, cousins, the, canada, lynx, lynx, canadensis, or, canadian, lynx, is, a, north, american, felid, that, ranges, in, forest, and, tundra, regions, across, canada, and, into, alaska, as, well, as, some, parts, of, the, northern, united, states, historically, the, canadian, lynx, ranged, from, alaska, across, canada, and, into, many, of, the, northern, u, s, states, in, the, eastern, states, it, resided, in, the, transition, zone, in, which, boreal, coniferous, forests, yielded, to, deciduous, forests, by, 2010, after, an, 11, year, effort, it, had, been, successfully, reintroduced, into, colorado, where, it, had, become, extirpated, in, the, 1970s, in, 2000, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, designated, the, canada, lynx, a, threatened, species, in, the, lower, 48, states, the, canada, lynx, is, a, good, climber, and, swimmer, it, constructs, rough, shelters, under, fallen, trees, or, rock, ledges, it, has, a, thick, coat, and, broad, paws, and, is, twice, as, effective, as, the, bobcat, at, supporting, its, weight, on, the, snow, the, canada, lynx, feeds, almost, exclusively, on, snowshoe, hares, its, population, is, highly, dependent, on, the, population, of, this, prey, animal, it, will, also, hunt, medium, sized, mammals, and, birds, if, hare, numbers, fall, the, iberian, lynx, lynx, pardinus, is, a, vulnerable, species, native, to, the, iberian, peninsula, in, southern, europe, it, was, the, most, endangered, cat, species, in, the, world, but, conservation, efforts, have, changed, its, status, from, critical, to, endangered, to, vulnerable, the, loss, of, the, species, would, have, been, the, first, feline, extinction, since, the, smilodon, 10, 000, years, ago, the, species, used, to, be, classified, as, a, subspecies, of, the, eurasian, lynx, but, is, now, considered, a, separate, species, both, species, occurred, together, in, central, europe, in, the, pleistocene, epoch, being, separated, by, habitat, choice, the, iberian, lynx, is, believed, to, have, evolved, from, lynx, issiodorensis, the, bobcat, lynx, rufus, is, a, north, american, wild, cat, with, 13, recognized, subspecies, the, bobcat, is, common, throughout, southern, canada, the, continental, united, states, and, northern, mexico, like, the, eurasian, lynx, its, conservation, status, is, least, concern, the, bobcat, is, an, adaptable, predator, that, inhabits, deciduous, coniferous, or, mixed, woodlands, but, unlike, other, lynx, does, not, depend, exclusively, on, the, deep, forest, and, ranges, from, swamps, and, desert, lands, to, mountainous, and, agricultural, areas, its, spotted, coat, serving, as, camouflage, the, population, of, the, bobcat, depends, primarily, on, the, population, of, its, prey, nonetheless, the, bobcat, is, often, killed, by, larger, predators, such, as, coyotes, the, bobcat, resembles, other, species, of, the, genus, lynx, but, is, on, average, the, smallest, of, the, four, its, coat, is, variable, though, generally, tan, to, grayish, brown, with, black, streaks, on, the, body, and, dark, bars, on, the, forelegs, and, tail, the, ears, are, black, tipped, and, pointed, with, short, black, tufts, there, is, generally, an, off, white, color, on, the, lips, chin, and, underparts, bobcats, in, the, desert, regions, of, the, southwest, have, the, lightest, colored, coats, while, those, in, the, northern, forested, regions, have, the, darkest, the, lynx, is, usually, solitary, although, a, small, group, of, lynx, may, travel, and, hunt, together, occasionally, mating, takes, place, in, the, late, winter, and, once, a, year, the, female, gives, birth, to, between, one, and, four, kittens, the, gestation, time, of, the, lynx, is, about, 70, days, the, young, stay, with, the, mother, for, one, more, winter, a, total, of, around, nine, months, before, moving, out, to, live, on, their, own, as, young, adults, the, lynx, creates, its, den, in, crevices, or, under, ledges, it, feeds, on, a, wide, range, of, animals, from, white, tailed, deer, reindeer, roe, deer, small, red, deer, and, chamois, to, smaller, more, usual, prey, snowshoe, hares, fish, foxes, sheep, squirrels, mice, turkeys, and, other, birds, and, goats, it, also, eats, ptarmigans, voles, and, grouse, the, lynx, inhabits, high, altitude, forests, with, dense, cover, of, shrubs, reeds, and, tall, grass, although, this, cat, hunts, on, the, ground, it, can, climb, trees, and, can, swim, swiftly, catching, fish, the, eurasian, lynx, ranges, from, central, and, northern, europe, across, asia, up, to, northern, pakistan, and, india, in, iran, they, live, in, mount, damavand, area, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, eurasian, lynx, was, considered, extinct, in, the, wild, in, slovenia, and, croatia, a, resettlement, project, begun, in, 1973, has, successfully, reintroduced, lynx, to, the, slovenian, alps, and, the, croatian, regions, of, gorski, kotar, and, velebit, including, croatia, s, plitvice, lakes, national, park, and, risnjak, national, park, in, both, countries, the, lynx, is, listed, as, an, endangered, species, and, protected, by, law, the, lynx, was, distributed, throughout, japan, during, j, mon, period, with, no, paleontological, evidence, thereafter, suggesting, extinction, at, that, time, several, lynx, resettlement, projects, begun, in, the, 1970s, have, been, successful, in, various, regions, of, switzerland, since, the, 1990s, there, have, been, numerous, efforts, to, resettle, the, eurasian, lynx, in, germany, and, since, 2000, a, small, population, can, now, be, found, in, the, harz, mountains, near, bad, lauterberg, the, lynx, is, found, in, the, bia, owie, a, forest, in, northeastern, poland, and, in, the, northern, and, western, parts, of, china, particularly, the, tibetan, plateau, in, romania, the, numbers, exceed, 2, 000, the, largest, population, in, europe, outside, of, russia, although, most, experts, consider, the, official, population, numbers, to, be, overestimated, the, lynx, is, more, common, in, northern, europe, especially, in, norway, sweden, estonia, finland, and, the, northern, parts, of, russia, the, swedish, population, is, estimated, to, be, 1200, 1500, individuals, spread, all, over, the, country, but, more, common, in, middle, sweden, and, in, the, mountain, range, the, lynx, population, in, finland, was, 1900, 2100, individuals, in, 2008, and, the, numbers, have, been, increasing, every, year, since, 1992, the, lynx, population, in, finland, is, estimated, currently, to, be, larger, than, ever, before, lynx, in, britain, were, wiped, out, in, the, 17th, century, but, there, have, been, calls, to, reintroduce, them, to, curb, the, numbers, of, deer, the, endangered, iberian, lynx, lives, in, southern, spain, and, formerly, in, eastern, portugal, there, is, an, iberian, lynx, reproduction, center, outside, silves, in, the, algarve, in, southern, portugal, the, two, lynx, species, in, north, america, canada, lynx, and, bobcats, are, both, found, in, the, temperate, zone, while, the, bobcat, is, common, throughout, southern, canada, the, continental, united, states, and, northern, mexico, the, canada, lynx, is, present, mainly, in, boreal, forests, of, canada, and,
