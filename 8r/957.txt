canellales, laurales, magnoliales, piperales, magnoliids, magnoliidae, or, magnolianae, are, a, clade, of, flowering, plants, with, more, than, 10, 000, species, including, magnolias, nutmeg, bay, laurel, cinnamon, avocado, black, pepper, tulip, tree, and, many, others, it, is, the, third, largest, group, of, angiosperms, after, the, eudicots, and, monocots, the, group, is, characterized, by, trimerous, flowers, pollen, with, one, pore, and, usually, branching, veined, leaves, some, members, of, the, subclass, are, among, the, earliest, angiosperms, and, share, anatomical, similarities, with, gymnosperms, like, stamens, that, resemble, the, male, cone, scales, of, conifers, and, carpels, found, on, the, long, flowering, axis, magnoliidae, is, the, botanical, name, of, a, subclass, and, magnoliids, is, an, informal, name, that, does, not, conform, to, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, algae, fungi, and, plants, the, circumscription, of, a, subclass, will, vary, with, the, taxonomic, system, being, used, the, only, requirement, is, that, it, must, include, the, family, magnoliaceae, the, informal, name, magnoliids, is, used, by, some, researchers, to, avoid, the, confusion, that, recently, surrounds, the, name, magnoliidae, more, recently, the, group, has, been, redefined, under, the, phylocode, as, a, node, based, clade, comprising, the, canellales, laurales, magnoliales, and, piperales, chase, reveal, have, proposed, magnoliidae, as, the, name, used, for, the, entire, group, of, flowering, plants, and, the, formal, name, magnolianae, for, the, group, of, four, orders, discussed, here, the, apg, iii, 2009, and, its, predecessor, systems, did, not, originally, use, formal, botanical, names, above, the, rank, of, order, under, those, systems, larger, clades, were, usually, referred, to, by, informal, names, such, as, magnoliids, plural, not, capitalized, or, magnoliid, complex, the, formal, name, in, linnean, nomenclature, was, specified, in, a, separate, apg, publication, as, the, existing, name, magnolianae, takht, 1967, the, apg, iii, recognizes, a, clade, within, the, angiosperms, for, the, magnoliids, the, circumscription, is, chloranthales, canellales, piperales, laurales, magnoliales, monocots, ceratophyllales, eudicots, the, clade, includes, most, of, the, basal, groups, of, the, angiosperms, this, clade, was, formally, named, magnoliidae, in, 2007, under, provisions, of, the, phylocode, the, cronquist, system, 1981, used, the, name, magnoliidae, for, one, of, six, subclasses, within, class, magnoliopsida, dicotyledons, in, the, original, version, of, this, system, the, circumscription, was, both, dahlgren, and, thorne, classified, the, magnoliids, sensu, apg, in, superorder, magnolianae, rather, than, as, a, subclass, in, their, systems, the, name, magnoliidae, is, used, for, a, much, larger, group, including, all, dicotyledons, this, is, also, the, case, in, some, of, the, systems, derived, from, the, cronquist, system, dahlgren, divided, his, magnolianae, into, ten, orders, more, than, other, systems, of, the, time, and, unlike, cronquist, and, thorne, he, did, not, include, the, piperales, thorne, grouped, most, of, his, magnolianae, into, two, large, orders, magnoliales, and, berberidales, although, his, magnoliales, was, divided, into, suborders, along, lines, similar, to, the, ordinal, groupings, used, by, both, cronquist, and, dahlgren, thorne, revised, his, system, in, 2000, restricting, the, name, magnoliidae, to, include, only, the, magnolianae, nymphaeanae, and, rafflesianae, and, removing, the, berberidales, and, other, previously, included, groups, to, his, subclass, ranunculidae, this, revised, system, diverges, from, the, cronquist, system, but, agrees, more, closely, with, the, circumscription, later, published, under, apg, ii, comparison, of, classification, systems, is, often, difficult, two, authors, may, apply, the, same, name, to, groups, with, different, composition, of, members, for, example, dahlgren, s, magnoliidae, includes, all, dicots, whereas, cronquists, magnoliidae, is, only, one, of, five, dicot, groups, two, authors, may, also, describe, the, same, group, with, nearly, identical, composition, but, each, may, then, apply, a, different, name, to, that, group, or, place, the, group, at, a, different, taxonomic, rank, for, example, the, composition, of, cronquist, s, subclass, magnoliidae, is, nearly, the, same, as, thorne, s, 1992, superorder, magnolianae, despite, the, difference, in, taxonomic, rank, because, of, these, difficulties, and, others, the, synoptic, table, below, imprecisely, compares, the, definition, of, magnoliid, groups, in, the, systems, of, four, authors, for, each, system, only, orders, are, named, in, the, table, all, orders, included, by, a, particular, author, are, listed, and, linked, in, that, column, when, a, taxon, is, not, included, by, that, author, but, was, included, by, an, author, in, another, column, that, item, appears, in, unlinked, italics, and, indicates, remote, placement, the, sequence, of, each, system, has, been, altered, from, its, publication, in, order, to, pair, corresponding, taxa, between, columns, the, magnoliids, is, a, large, group, of, plants, with, many, species, that, are, economically, important, as, food, drugs, perfumes, timber, and, as, ornamentals, among, many, other, uses, one, widely, cultivated, magnoliid, fruit, is, the, avocado, persea, americana, which, is, believed, to, have, been, cultivated, in, mexico, and, central, america, for, nearly, 10, 000, years, now, grown, throughout, the, tropics, it, probably, originates, from, the, chiapas, region, of, mexico, or, guatemala, where, wild, avocados, may, still, be, found, the, soft, pulp, of, the, fruit, is, eaten, fresh, or, mashed, into, guacamole, the, ancient, peoples, of, central, america, were, also, the, first, to, cultivate, several, fruit, bearing, species, of, annona, these, include, the, custard, apple, a, reticulata, soursop, a, muricata, sweetsop, or, sugar, apple, a, squamosa, and, the, cherimoya, a, cherimola, both, soursop, and, sweetsop, now, are, widely, grown, for, their, fruits, in, the, old, world, as, well, some, members, of, the, magnoliids, have, served, as, important, food, additives, such, as, black, pepper, nutmeg, bay, laurel, and, cinnamon, oil, of, sassafras, was, formerly, used, as, a, key, flavoring, in, both, root, beer, and, in, sarsaparilla, the, primary, ingredient, responsible, for, the, oil, s, flavor, is, safrole, but, it, is, no, longer, used, in, either, the, united, states, or, canada, both, nations, banned, the, use, of, safrole, as, a, food, additive, in, 1960, as, a, result, of, studies, that, demonstrated, safrole, promoted, liver, damage, and, tumors, in, mice, consumption, of, more, than, a, minute, quantity, of, the, oil, causes, nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, and, shallow, rapid, breathing, it, is, very, toxic, and, can, severely, damage, the, kidneys, in, addition, to, its, former, use, as, a, food, additive, safrole, from, either, sassafras, or, ocotea, cymbarum, is, also, the, primary, precursor, for, synthesis, of, mdma, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, commonly, known, as, the, drug, ecstasy, other, magnoliids, also, are, known, for, their, narcotic, hallucinogenic, or, paralytic, properties, the, polynesian, beverage, kava, is, prepared, from, the, pulverized, roots, of, piper, methysticum, and, has, both, sedative, and, narcotic, properties, it, is, used, throughout, the, pacific, in, social, gatherings, or, after, work, to, relax, likewise, some, native, peoples, of, the, amazon, take, a, hallucinogenic, snuff, made, from, the, dried, and, powdered, fluid, exuded, from, the, bark, of, virola, trees, another, hallucinogenic, compound, myristicin, comes, from, the, spice, nutmeg, as, with, safrole, ingestion, of, nutmeg, in, quantities, can, lead, to, hallucinations, nausea, and, vomiting, with, symptoms, lasting, several, days, a, more, severe, reaction, comes, from, poisoning, by, rodiasine, and, demethylrodiasine, the, active, ingredients, in, fruit, extract, from, chlorocardium, venenosum, these, chemicals, paralyze, muscles, and, nerves, resulting, in, tetanus, like, reactions, in, animals, the, cof, n, peoples, of, westernmost, amazon, in, colombia, and, ecuador, use, the, compound, as, a, poison, to, tip, their, arrows, in, hunting, not, all, the, effects, of, chemical, compounds, in, the, magnoliids, are, detrimental, in, previous, centuries, sailors, would, use, winter, s, bark, from, the, south, american, tree, drimys, winteri, to, ward, off, the, vitamin, deficiency, of, scurvy, today, benzoyl, is, extracted, from, lindera, benzoin, common, spicebush, for, use, as, a, food, additive, and, skin, medicine, due, to, its, anti, bacterial, and, anti, fungal, properties, drugs, extracted, from, the, bark, of, magnolia, have, long, been, used, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, scientific, investigation, of, magnolol, and, honokiol, have, shown, promise, for, their, use, in, dental, health, both, compounds, demonstrate, effective, anti, bacterial, activity, against, the, bacteria, responsible, for, bad, breath, and, dental, caries, several, members, of, the, family, annonaceae, are, also, under, investigation, for, uses, of, a, group, of, chemicals, called, acetogenins, the, first, acetogenin, discovered, was, uvaricin, which, has, anti, leukemic, properties, when, used, in, living, organisms, other, acetogenins, have, been, discovered, with, anti, malarial, and, anti, tumor, properties, and, some, even, inhibit, hiv, replication, in, laboratory, studies, many, magnoliid, species, produce, essential, oils, in, their, leaves, bark, or, wood, the, tree, virola, surinamensis, brazilian, nutmeg, contains, trimyristin, which, is, extracted, in, the, form, of, a, fat, and, used, in, soaps, and, candles, as, well, as, in, shortenings, other, fragrant, volatile, oils, are, extracted, from, aniba, rosaeodora, bois, de, rose, oil, cinnamomum, porrectum, cinnamomum, cassia, and, litsea, odorifera, for, scenting, soaps, perfumes, also, are, made, from, some, of, these, oils, ylang, ylang, comes, from, the, flowers, of, cananga, odorata, and, is, used, by, arab, and, swahili, women, a, compound, called, nutmeg, butter, is, produced, from, the, same, tree, as, the, spice, of, that, name, but, the, sweet, smelling, butter, is, used, in, perfumery, or, as, a, lubricant, rather, than, as, a, food
