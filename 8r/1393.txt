a, virus, is, a, submicroscopic, infectious, agent, that, replicates, only, inside, the, living, cells, of, an, organism, viruses, infect, all, life, forms, from, animals, and, plants, to, microorganisms, including, bacteria, and, archaea, viruses, are, found, in, almost, every, ecosystem, on, earth, and, are, the, most, numerous, type, of, biological, entity, since, dmitri, ivanovsky, s, 1892, article, describing, a, non, bacterial, pathogen, infecting, tobacco, plants, and, the, discovery, of, the, tobacco, mosaic, virus, by, martinus, beijerinck, in, 1898, 4, more, than, 11, 000, of, the, millions, of, virus, species, have, been, described, in, detail, the, study, of, viruses, is, known, as, virology, a, subspeciality, of, microbiology, when, infected, a, host, cell, is, often, forced, to, rapidly, produce, thousands, of, copies, of, the, original, virus, when, not, inside, an, infected, cell, or, in, the, process, of, infecting, a, cell, viruses, exist, in, the, form, of, independent, viral, particles, or, virions, consisting, of, i, genetic, material, i, e, long, molecules, of, dna, or, rna, that, encode, the, structure, of, the, proteins, by, which, the, virus, acts, ii, a, protein, coat, the, capsid, which, surrounds, and, protects, the, genetic, material, and, in, some, cases, iii, an, outside, envelope, of, lipids, the, shapes, of, these, virus, particles, range, from, simple, helical, and, icosahedral, forms, to, more, complex, structures, most, virus, species, have, virions, too, small, to, be, seen, with, an, optical, microscope, and, are, one, hundredth, the, size, of, most, bacteria, the, origins, of, viruses, in, the, evolutionary, history, of, life, are, still, unclear, some, viruses, may, have, evolved, from, plasmids, which, are, pieces, of, dna, that, can, move, between, cells, other, viruses, may, have, evolved, from, bacteria, in, evolution, viruses, are, an, important, means, of, horizontal, gene, transfer, which, increases, genetic, diversity, in, a, way, analogous, to, sexual, reproduction, viruses, are, considered, by, some, biologists, to, be, a, life, form, because, they, carry, genetic, material, reproduce, and, evolve, through, natural, selection, although, they, lack, some, key, characteristics, such, as, cell, structure, that, are, generally, considered, necessary, criteria, for, defining, life, because, they, possess, some, but, not, all, such, qualities, viruses, have, been, described, as, organisms, at, the, edge, of, life, and, as, replicators, viruses, spread, in, many, ways, one, transmission, pathway, is, through, disease, bearing, organisms, known, as, vectors, for, example, viruses, are, often, transmitted, from, plant, to, plant, by, insects, that, feed, on, plant, sap, such, as, aphids, and, viruses, in, animals, can, be, carried, by, blood, sucking, insects, many, viruses, spread, in, the, air, by, coughing, and, sneezing, including, influenza, viruses, sars, cov, 2, chickenpox, smallpox, and, measles, norovirus, and, rotavirus, common, causes, of, viral, gastroenteritis, are, transmitted, by, the, faecal, oral, route, passed, by, hand, to, mouth, contact, or, in, food, or, water, the, infectious, dose, of, norovirus, required, to, produce, infection, in, humans, is, fewer, than, 100, particles, hiv, is, one, of, several, viruses, transmitted, through, sexual, contact, and, by, exposure, to, infected, blood, the, variety, of, host, cells, that, a, virus, can, infect, is, called, its, host, range, this, is, narrow, for, viruses, specialized, to, infect, only, a, few, species, or, broad, for, viruses, capable, of, infecting, many, 123, 124, viral, infections, in, animals, provoke, an, immune, response, that, usually, eliminates, the, infecting, virus, immune, responses, can, also, be, produced, by, vaccines, which, confer, an, artificially, acquired, immunity, to, the, specific, viral, infection, some, viruses, including, those, that, cause, hiv, aids, hpv, infection, and, viral, hepatitis, evade, these, immune, responses, and, result, in, chronic, infections, several, classes, of, antiviral, drugs, have, been, developed, the, english, word, virus, comes, from, the, latin, v, rus, which, refers, to, poison, and, other, noxious, liquids, v, rus, comes, from, the, same, indo, european, root, as, sanskrit, vi, a, avestan, v, a, and, ancient, greek, i, s, which, all, mean, poison, the, first, attested, use, of, virus, in, english, appeared, in, 1398, in, john, trevisa, s, translation, of, bartholomeus, anglicus, s, de, proprietatibus, rerum, virulent, from, latin, virulentus, poisonous, dates, to, c, 1400, a, meaning, of, agent, that, causes, infectious, disease, is, first, recorded, in, 1728, long, before, the, discovery, of, viruses, by, dmitri, ivanovsky, in, 1892, the, english, plural, is, viruses, sometimes, also, vira, whereas, the, latin, word, is, a, mass, noun, which, has, no, classically, attested, plural, v, ra, is, used, in, neo, latin, the, adjective, viral, dates, to, 1948, the, term, virion, plural, virions, which, dates, from, 1959, is, also, used, to, refer, to, a, single, viral, particle, that, is, released, from, the, cell, and, is, capable, of, infecting, other, cells, of, the, same, type, viruses, are, found, wherever, there, is, life, and, have, probably, existed, since, living, cells, first, evolved, the, origin, of, viruses, is, unclear, because, they, do, not, form, fossils, so, molecular, techniques, are, used, to, infer, how, they, arose, in, addition, viral, genetic, material, occasionally, integrates, into, the, germline, of, the, host, organisms, by, which, they, can, be, passed, on, vertically, to, the, offspring, of, the, host, for, many, generations, this, provides, an, invaluable, source, of, information, for, paleovirologists, to, trace, back, ancient, viruses, that, existed, as, far, back, as, millions, of, years, ago, there, are, three, main, hypotheses, that, aim, to, explain, the, origins, of, viruses, in, the, past, there, were, problems, with, all, of, these, hypotheses, the, regressive, hypothesis, did, not, explain, why, even, the, smallest, of, cellular, parasites, do, not, resemble, viruses, in, any, way, the, escape, hypothesis, did, not, explain, the, complex, capsids, and, other, structures, on, virus, particles, the, virus, first, hypothesis, contravened, the, definition, of, viruses, in, that, they, require, host, cells, 24, viruses, are, now, recognised, as, ancient, and, as, having, origins, that, pre, date, the, divergence, of, life, into, the, three, domains, 28, this, discovery, has, led, modern, virologists, to, reconsider, and, re, evaluate, these, three, classical, hypotheses, 28, the, evidence, for, an, ancestral, world, of, rna, cells, 26, and, computer, analysis, of, viral, and, host, dna, sequences, give, a, better, understanding, of, the, evolutionary, relationships, between, different, viruses, and, may, help, identify, the, ancestors, of, modern, viruses, to, date, such, analyses, have, not, proved, which, of, these, hypotheses, is, correct, 26, it, seems, unlikely, that, all, currently, known, viruses, have, a, common, ancestor, and, viruses, have, probably, arisen, numerous, times, in, the, past, by, one, or, more, mechanisms, the, first, evidence, of, the, existence, of, viruses, came, from, experiments, with, filters, that, had, pores, small, enough, to, retain, bacteria, in, 1892, dmitri, ivanovsky, used, one, of, these, filters, to, show, that, sap, from, a, diseased, tobacco, plant, remained, infectious, to, healthy, tobacco, plants, despite, having, been, filtered, martinus, beijerinck, called, the, filtered, infectious, substance, a, virus, and, this, discovery, is, considered, to, be, the, beginning, of, virology, the, subsequent, discovery, and, partial, characterization, of, bacteriophages, by, frederick, twort, and, f, lix, d, herelle, further, catalyzed, the, field, and, by, the, early, 20th, century, many, viruses, had, been, discovered, in, 1926, thomas, milton, rivers, defined, viruses, as, obligate, parasites, viruses, were, demonstrated, to, be, particles, rather, than, a, fluid, by, wendell, meredith, stanley, and, the, invention, of, the, electron, microscope, in, 1931, allowed, their, complex, structures, to, be, visualised, scientific, opinions, differ, on, whether, viruses, are, a, form, of, life, or, organic, structures, that, interact, with, living, organisms, they, have, been, described, as, organisms, at, the, edge, of, life, since, they, resemble, organisms, in, that, they, possess, genes, evolve, by, natural, selection, and, reproduce, by, creating, multiple, copies, of, themselves, through, self, assembly, although, they, have, genes, they, do, not, have, a, cellular, structure, which, is, often, seen, as, the, basic, unit, of, life, viruses, do, not, have, their, own, metabolism, and, require, a, host, cell, to, make, new, products, they, therefore, cannot, naturally, reproduce, outside, a, host, cell, although, some, bacteria, such, as, rickettsia, and, chlamydia, are, considered, living, organisms, despite, the, same, limitation, accepted, forms, of, life, use, cell, division, to, reproduce, whereas, viruses, spontaneously, assemble, within, cells, they, differ, from, autonomous, growth, of, crystals, as, they, inherit, genetic, mutations, while, being, subject, to, natural, selection, virus, self, assembly, within, host, cells, has, implications, for, the, study, of, the, origin, of, life, as, it, lends, further, credence, to, the, hypothesis, that, life, could, have, started, as, self, assembling, organic, molecules, the, virocell, model, first, proposed, by, patrick, forterre, considers, the, infected, cell, to, be, the, living, form, of, viruses, and, that, virus, particles, virions, are, analogous, to, spores, although, the, living, versus, non, living, debate, continues, the, virocell, model, has, gained, some, acceptance, viruses, display, a, wide, diversity, of, sizes, and, shapes, called, morphologies, in, general, viruses, are, much, smaller, than, bacteria, and, more, than, a, thousand, bacteriophage, viruses, would, fit, inside, an, escherichia, coli, bacterium, s, cell, 98, many, viruses, that, have, been, studied, are, spherical, and, have, a, diameter, between, 20, and, 300, nanometres, some, filoviruses, which, are, filaments, have, a, total, length, of, up, to, 1400, nm, their, diameters, are, only, about, 80, nm, 33, 55, most, viruses, cannot, be, seen, with, an, optical, microscope, so, scanning, and, transmission, electron, microscopes, are, used, to, visualise, them, 33, 37, to, increase, the, contrast, between, viruses, and, the, background, electron, dense, stains, are, used, these, are, solutions, of, salts, of, heavy, metals, such, as, tungsten, that, scatter, the, electrons, from, regions, covered, with, the, stain, when, virions, are, coated, with, stain, positive, staining, fine, detail, is, obscured, negative, staining, overcomes, this, problem, by, staining, the, background, only, a, complete, virus, particle, known, as, a, virion, consists, of, nucleic, acid, surrounded, by, a, protective, coat, of, protein, called, a, capsid, these, are, formed, from, protein, subunits, called, capsomeres, 40, viruses, can, have, a, lipid, envelope, derived, from, the, host, cell, membrane, the, capsid, is, made, from, proteins, encoded, by, the, viral, genome, and, its, shape, serves, as, the, basis, for, morphological, distinction, virally, coded, protein, subunits, will, self, assemble, to, form, a, capsid, in, general, requiring, the, presence, of, the, virus, genome, complex, viruses, code, for, proteins, that, assist, in, the, construction, of, their, capsid, proteins, associated, with, nucleic, acid, are, known, as, nucleoproteins, and, the, association, of, viral, capsid, proteins, with, viral, nucleic, acid, is, called, a, nucleocapsid, the, capsid, and, entire, virus, structure, can, be, mechanically, physically, probed, through, atomic, force, microscopy, in, general, there, are, five, main, morphological, virus, types, the, poxviruses, are, large, complex, viruses, that, have, an, unusual, morphology, the, viral, genome, is, associated, with, proteins, within, a, central, disc, structure, known, as, a, nucleoid, the, nucleoid, is, surrounded, by, a, membrane, and, two, lateral, bodies, of, unknown, function, the, virus, has, an, outer, envelope, with, a, thick, layer, of, protein, studded, over, its, surface, the, whole, virion, is, slightly, pleomorphic, ranging, from, ovoid, to, brick, shaped, mimivirus, is, one, of, the, largest, characterised, viruses, with, a, capsid, diameter, of, 400, nm, protein, filaments, measuring, 100, nm, project, from, the, surface, the, capsid, appears, hexagonal, under, an, electron, microscope, therefore, the, capsid, is, probably, icosahedral, in, 2011, researchers, discovered, the, largest, then, known, virus, in, samples, of, water, collected, from, the, ocean, floor, off, the, coast, of, las, cruces, chile, provisionally, named, megavirus, chilensis, it, can, be, seen, with, a, basic, optical, microscope, in, 2013, the, pandoravirus, genus, was, discovered, in, chile, and, australia, and, has, genomes, about, twice, as, large, as, megavirus, and, mimivirus, all, giant, viruses, have, dsdna, genomes, and, they, are, classified, into, several, families, mimiviridae, pithoviridae, pandoraviridae, phycodnaviridae, and, the, mollivirus, genus, some, viruses, that, infect, archaea, have, complex, structures, unrelated, to, any, other, form, of, virus, with, a, wide, variety, of, unusual, shapes, ranging, from, spindle, shaped, structures, to, viruses, that, resemble, hooked, rods, teardrops, or, even, bottles, other, archaeal, viruses, resemble, the, tailed, bacteriophages, and, can, have, multiple, tail, structures, an, enormous, variety, of, genomic, structures, can, be, seen, among, viral, species, as, a, group, they, contain, more, structural, genomic, diversity, than, plants, animals, archaea, or, bacteria, there, are, millions, of, different, types, of, viruses, although, fewer, than, 7, 000, types, have, been, described, in, detail, 49, as, of, january, 2021, the, ncbi, virus, genome, database, has, more, than, 193, 000, complete, genome, sequences, but, there, are, doubtlessly, many, more, to, be, discovered, a, virus, has, either, a, dna, or, an, rna, genome, and, is, called, a, dna, virus, or, an, rna, virus, respectively, most, viruses, have, rna, genomes, plant, viruses, tend, to, have, single, stranded, rna, genomes, and, bacteriophages, tend, to, have, double, stranded, dna, genomes, 96, 99, viral, genomes, are, circular, as, in, the, polyomaviruses, or, linear, as, in, the, adenoviruses, the, type, of, nucleic, acid, is, irrelevant, to, the, shape, of, the, genome, among, rna, viruses, and, certain, dna, viruses, the, genome, is, often, divided, into, separate, parts, in, which, case, it, is, called, segmented, for, rna, viruses, each, segment, often, codes, for, only, one, protein, and, they, are, usually, found, together, in, one, capsid, all, segments, are, not, required, to, be, in, the, same, virion, for, the, virus, to, be, infectious, as, demonstrated, by, brome, mosaic, virus, and, several, other, plant, viruses, 33, 35, a, viral, genome, irrespective, of, nucleic, acid, type, is, almost, always, either, single, stranded, ss, or, double, stranded, ds, single, stranded, genomes, consist, of, an, unpaired, nucleic, acid, analogous, to, one, half, of, a, ladder, split, down, the, middle, double, stranded, genomes, consist, of, two, complementary, paired, nucleic, acids, analogous, to, a, ladder, the, virus, particles, of, some, virus, families, such, as, those, belonging, to, the, hepadnaviridae, contain, a, genome, that, is, partially, double, stranded, and, partially, single, stranded, 96, 99, for, most, viruses, with, rna, genomes, and, some, with, single, stranded, dna, ssdna, genomes, the, single, strands, are, said, to, be, either, positive, sense, called, the, plus, strand, or, negative, sense, called, the, minus, strand, depending, on, if, they, are, complementary, to, the, viral, messenger, rna, mrna, positive, sense, viral, rna, is, in, the, same, sense, as, viral, mrna, and, thus, at, least, a, part, of, it, can, be, immediately, translated, by, the, host, cell, negative, sense, viral, rna, is, complementary, to, mrna, and, thus, must, be, converted, to, positive, sense, rna, by, an, rna, dependent, rna, polymerase, before, translation, dna, nomenclature, for, viruses, with, genomic, ssdna, is, similar, to, rna, nomenclature, in, that, positive, strand, viral, ssdna, is, identical, in, sequence, to, the, viral, mrna, and, is, thus, a, coding, strand, while, negative, sense, viral, ssdna, is, complementary, to, the, viral, mrna, and, is, thus, a, template, strand, 96, 99, several, types, of, ssdna, and, ssrna, viruses, have, genomes, that, are, ambisense, in, that, transcription, can, occur, off, both, strands, in, a, double, stranded, replicative, intermediate, examples, include, geminiviruses, which, are, ssdna, plant, viruses, and, arenaviruses, which, are, ssrna, viruses, of, animals, genome, size, varies, greatly, between, species, the, smallest, the, ssdna, circoviruses, family, circoviridae, code, for, only, two, proteins, and, have, a, genome, size, of, only, two, kilobases, the, largest, the, pandoraviruses, have, genome, sizes, of, around, two, megabases, which, code, for, about, 2500, proteins, virus, genes, rarely, have, introns, and, often, are, arranged, in, the, genome, so, that, they, overlap, in, general, rna, viruses, have, smaller, genome, sizes, than, dna, viruses, because, of, a, higher, error, rate, when, replicating, and, have, a, maximum, upper, size, limit, beyond, this, errors, when, replicating, render, the, virus, useless, or, uncompetitive, to, compensate, rna, viruses, often, have, segmented, genomes, the, genome, is, split, into, smaller, molecules, thus, reducing, the, chance, that, an, error, in, a, single, component, genome, will, incapacitate, the, entire, genome, in, contrast, dna, viruses, generally, have, larger, genomes, because, of, the, high, fidelity, of, their, replication, enzymes, single, strand, dna, viruses, are, an, exception, to, this, rule, as, mutation, rates, for, these, genomes, can, approach, the, extreme, of, the, ssrna, virus, case, viruses, undergo, genetic, change, by, several, mechanisms, these, include, a, process, called, antigenic, drift, where, individual, bases, in, the, dna, or, rna, mutate, to, other, bases, most, of, these, point, mutations, are, silent, they, do, not, change, the, protein, that, the, gene, encodes, but, others, can, confer, evolutionary, advantages, such, as, resistance, to, antiviral, drugs, antigenic, shift, occurs, when, there, is, a, major, change, in, the, genome, of, the, virus, this, can, be, a, result, of, recombination, or, reassortment, the, influenza, a, virus, is, highly, prone, to, reassortment, occasionally, this, has, resulted, in, novel, strains, which, have, caused, pandemics, rna, viruses, often, exist, as, quasispecies, or, swarms, of, viruses, of, the, same, species, but, with, slightly, different, genome, nucleoside, sequences, such, quasispecies, are, a, prime, target, for, natural, selection, segmented, genomes, confer, evolutionary, advantages, different, strains, of, a, virus, with, a, segmented, genome, can, shuffle, and, combine, genes, and, produce, progeny, viruses, or, offspring, that, have, unique, characteristics, this, is, called, reassortment, or, viral, sex, genetic, recombination, is, a, process, by, which, a, strand, of, dna, or, rna, is, broken, and, then, joined, to, the, end, of, a, different, dna, or, rna, molecule, this, can, occur, when, viruses, infect, cells, simultaneously, and, studies, of, viral, evolution, have, shown, that, recombination, has, been, rampant, in, the, species, studied, recombination, is, common, to, both, rna, and, dna, viruses, coronaviruses, have, a, single, strand, positive, sense, rna, genome, replication, of, the, genome, is, catalyzed, by, an, rna, dependent, rna, polymerase, the, mechanism, of, recombination, used, by, coronaviruses, likely, involves, template, switching, by, the, polymerase, during, genome, replication, this, process, appears, to, be, an, adaptation, for, coping, with, genome, damage, viral, populations, do, not, grow, through, cell, division, because, they, are, acellular, instead, they, use, the, machinery, and, metabolism, of, a, host, cell, to, produce, multiple, copies, of, themselves, and, they, assemble, in, the, cell, when, infected, the, host, cell, is, forced, to, rapidly, produce, thousands, of, copies, of, the, original, virus, their, life, cycle, differs, greatly, between, species, but, there, are, six, basic, stages, in, their, life, cycle, 75, 91, attachment, is, a, specific, binding, between, viral, capsid, proteins, and, specific, receptors, on, the, host, cellular, surface, this, specificity, determines, the, host, range, and, type, of, host, cell, of, a, virus, for, example, hiv, infects, a, limited, range, of, human, leucocytes, this, is, because, its, surface, protein, gp120, specifically, interacts, with, the, cd4, molecule, a, chemokine, receptor, which, is, most, commonly, found, on, the, surface, of, cd4, t, cells, this, mechanism, has, evolved, to, favour, those, viruses, that, infect, only, cells, in, which, they, are, capable, of, replication, attachment, to, the, receptor, can, induce, the, viral, envelope, protein, to, undergo, changes, that, result, in, the, fusion, of, viral, and, cellular, membranes, or, changes, of, non, enveloped, virus, surface, proteins, that, allow, the, virus, to, enter, penetration, or, viral, entry, follows, attachment, virions, enter, the, host, cell, through, receptor, mediated, endocytosis, or, membrane, fusion, the, infection, of, plant, and, fungal, cells, is, different, from, that, of, animal, cells, plants, have, a, rigid, cell, wall, made, of, cellulose, and, fungi, one, of, chitin, so, most, viruses, can, get, inside, these, cells, only, after, trauma, to, the, cell, wall, 70, nearly, all, plant, viruses, such, as, tobacco, mosaic, virus, can, also, move, directly, from, cell, to, cell, in, the, form, of, single, stranded, nucleoprotein, complexes, through, pores, called, plasmodesmata, bacteria, like, plants, have, strong, cell, walls, that, a, virus, must, breach, to, infect, the, cell, given, that, bacterial, cell, walls, are, much, thinner, than, plant, cell, walls, due, to, their, much, smaller, size, some, viruses, have, evolved, mechanisms, that, inject, their, genome, into, the, bacterial, cell, across, the, cell, wall, while, the, viral, capsid, remains, outside, 71, uncoating, is, a, process, in, which, the, viral, capsid, is, removed, this, may, be, by, degradation, by, viral, enzymes, or, host, enzymes, or, by, simple, dissociation, the, end, result, is, the, releasing, of, the, viral, genomic, nucleic, acid, replication, of, viruses, involves, primarily, multiplication, of, the, genome, replication, involves, the, synthesis, of, viral, messenger, rna, mrna, from, early, genes, with, exceptions, for, positive, sense, rna, viruses, viral, protein, synthesis, possible, assembly, of, viral, proteins, then, viral, genome, replication, mediated, by, early, or, regulatory, protein, expression, this, may, be, followed, for, complex, viruses, with, larger, genomes, by, one, or, more, further, rounds, of, mrna, synthesis, late, gene, expression, is, in, general, of, structural, or, virion, proteins, assembly, following, the, structure, mediated, self, assembly, of, the, virus, particles, some, modification, of, the, proteins, often, occurs, in, viruses, such, as, hiv, this, modification, sometimes, called, maturation, occurs, after, the, virus, has, been, released, from, the, host, cell, release, viruses, can, be, released, from, the, host, cell, by, lysis, a, process, that, kills, the, cell, by, bursting, its, membrane, and, cell, wall, if, present, this, is, a, feature, of, many, bacterial, and, some, animal, viruses, some, viruses, undergo, a, lysogenic, cycle, where, the, viral, genome, is, incorporated, by, genetic, recombination, into, a, specific, place, in, the, host, s, chromosome, the, viral, genome, is, then, known, as, a, provirus, or, in, the, case, of, bacteriophages, a, prophage, 836, whenever, the, host, divides, the, viral, genome, is, also, replicated, the, viral, genome, is, mostly, silent, within, the, host, at, some, point, the, provirus, or, prophage, may, give, rise, to, the, active, virus, which, may, lyse, the, host, cells, 243, 259, enveloped, viruses, e, g, hiv, typically, are, released, from, the, host, cell, by, budding, during, this, process, the, virus, acquires, its, envelope, which, is, a, modified, piece, of, the, host, s, plasma, or, other, internal, membrane, 185, 187, the, genetic, material, within, virus, particles, and, the, method, by, which, the, material, is, replicated, varies, considerably, between, different, types, of, viruses, the, range, of, structural, and, biochemical, effects, that, viruses, have, on, the, host, cell, is, extensive, 115, 146, these, are, called, cytopathic, effects, 115, most, virus, infections, eventually, result, in, the, death, of, the, host, cell, the, causes, of, death, include, cell, lysis, alterations, to, the, cell, s, surface, membrane, and, apoptosis, often, cell, death, is, caused, by, cessation, of, its, normal, activities, because, of, suppression, by, virus, specific, proteins, not, all, of, which, are, components, of, the, virus, particle, the, distinction, between, cytopathic, and, harmless, is, gradual, some, viruses, such, as, epstein, barr, virus, can, cause, cells, to, proliferate, without, causing, malignancy, while, others, such, as, papillomaviruses, are, established, causes, of, cancer, some, viruses, cause, no, apparent, changes, to, the, infected, cell, cells, in, which, the, virus, is, latent, and, inactive, show, few, signs, of, infection, and, often, function, normally, this, causes, persistent, infections, and, the, virus, is, often, dormant, for, many, months, or, years, this, is, often, the, case, with, herpes, viruses, viruses, are, by, far, the, most, abundant, biological, entities, on, earth, and, they, outnumber, all, the, others, put, together, they, infect, all, types, of, cellular, life, including, animals, plants, bacteria, and, fungi, 49, different, types, of, viruses, can, infect, only, a, limited, range, of, hosts, and, many, are, species, specific, some, such, as, smallpox, virus, for, example, can, infect, only, one, species, in, this, case, humans, 643, and, are, said, to, have, a, narrow, host, range, other, viruses, such, as, rabies, virus, can, infect, different, species, of, mammals, and, are, said, to, have, a, broad, range, 631, the, viruses, that, infect, plants, are, harmless, to, animals, and, most, viruses, that, infect, other, animals, are, harmless, to, humans, 272, the, host, range, of, some, bacteriophages, is, limited, to, a, single, strain, of, bacteria, and, they, can, be, used, to, trace, the, source, of, outbreaks, of, infections, by, a, method, called, phage, typing, the, complete, set, of, viruses, in, an, organism, or, habitat, is, called, the, virome, for, example, all, human, viruses, constitute, the, human, virome, a, novel, virus, is, one, that, has, not, previously, been, recorded, it, can, be, a, virus, that, is, isolated, from, its, natural, reservoir, or, isolated, as, the, result, of, spread, to, an, animal, or, human, host, where, the, virus, had, not, been, identified, before, it, can, be, an, emergent, virus, one, that, represents, a, new, virus, but, it, can, also, be, an, extant, virus, that, has, not, been, previously, identified, the, sars, cov, 2, coronavirus, that, caused, the, covid, 19, pandemic, is, an, example, of, a, novel, virus, classification, seeks, to, describe, the, diversity, of, viruses, by, naming, and, grouping, them, on, the, basis, of, similarities, in, 1962, andr, lwoff, robert, horne, and, paul, tournier, were, the, first, to, develop, a, means, of, virus, classification, based, on, the, linnaean, hierarchical, system, this, system, based, classification, on, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and, species, viruses, were, grouped, according, to, their, shared, properties, not, those, of, their, hosts, and, the, type, of, nucleic, acid, forming, their, genomes, in, 1966, the, international, committee, on, taxonomy, of, viruses, ictv, was, formed, the, system, proposed, by, lwoff, horne, and, tournier, was, initially, not, accepted, by, the, ictv, because, the, small, genome, size, of, viruses, and, their, high, rate, of, mutation, made, it, difficult, to, determine, their, ancestry, beyond, order, as, such, the, baltimore, classification, system, has, come, to, be, used, to, supplement, the, more, traditional, hierarchy, starting, in, 2018, the, ictv, began, to, acknowledge, deeper, evolutionary, relationships, between, viruses, that, have, been, discovered, over, time, and, adopted, a, 15, rank, classification, system, ranging, from, realm, to, species, additionally, some, species, within, the, same, genus, are, grouped, into, a, genogroup, the, ictv, developed, the, current, classification, system, and, wrote, guidelines, that, put, a, greater, weight, on, certain, virus, properties, to, maintain, family, uniformity, a, unified, taxonomy, a, universal, system, for, classifying, viruses, has, been, established, only, a, small, part, of, the, total, diversity, of, viruses, has, been, studied, as, of, 2022, 6, realms, 10, kingdoms, 17, phyla, 2, subphyla, 40, classes, 72, orders, 8, suborders, 264, families, 182, subfamilies, 2, 818, genera, 84, subgenera, and, 11, 273, species, of, viruses, have, been, defined, by, the, ictv, the, general, taxonomic, structure, of, taxon, ranges, and, the, suffixes, used, in, taxonomic, names, are, shown, hereafter, as, of, 2022, the, ranks, of, subrealm, subkingdom, and, subclass, are, unused, whereas, all, other, ranks, are, in, use, the, nobel, prize, winning, biologist, david, baltimore, devised, the, baltimore, classification, system, the, ictv, classification, system, is, used, in, conjunction, with, the, baltimore, classification, system, in, modern, virus, classification, the, baltimore, classification, of, viruses, is, based, on, the, mechanism, of, mrna, production, viruses, must, generate, mrnas, from, their, genomes, to, produce, proteins, and, replicate, themselves, but, different, mechanisms, are, used, to, achieve, this, in, each, virus, family, viral, genomes, may, be, single, stranded, ss, or, double, stranded, ds, rna, or, dna, and, may, or, may, not, use, reverse, transcriptase, rt, in, addition, ssrna, viruses, may, be, either, sense, or, antisense, this, classification, places, viruses, into, seven, groups, examples, of, common, human, diseases, caused, by, viruses, include, the, common, cold, influenza, chickenpox, and, cold, sores, many, serious, diseases, such, as, rabies, ebola, virus, disease, aids, hiv, avian, influenza, and, sars, are, caused, by, viruses, the, relative, ability, of, viruses, to, cause, disease, is, described, in, terms, of, virulence, other, diseases, are, under, investigation, to, discover, if, they, have, a, virus, as, the, causative, agent, such, as, the, possible, connection, between, human, herpesvirus, 6, hhv6, and, neurological, diseases, such, as, multiple, sclerosis, and, chronic, fatigue, syndrome, there, is, controversy, over, whether, the, bornavirus, previously, thought, to, cause, neurological, diseases, in, horses, could, be, responsible, for, psychiatric, illnesses, in, humans, viruses, have, different, mechanisms, by, which, they, produce, disease, in, an, organism, which, depends, largely, on, the, viral, species, mechanisms, at, the, cellular, level, primarily, include, cell, lysis, the, breaking, open, and, subsequent, death, of, the, cell, in, multicellular, organisms, if, enough, cells, die, the, whole, organism, will, start, to, suffer, the, effects, although, viruses, cause, disruption, of, healthy, homeostasis, resulting, in, disease, they, may, exist, relatively, harmlessly, within, an, organism, an, example, would, include, the, ability, of, the, herpes, simplex, virus, which, causes, cold, sores, to, remain, in, a, dormant, state, within, the, human, body, this, is, called, latency, and, is, a, characteristic, of, the, herpes, viruses, including, epstein, barr, virus, which, causes, glandular, fever, and, varicella, zoster, virus, which, causes, chickenpox, and, shingles, most, people, have, been, infected, with, at, least, one, of, these, types, of, herpes, virus, these, latent, viruses, might, sometimes, be, beneficial, as, the, presence, of, the, virus, can, increase, immunity, against, bacterial, pathogens, such, as, yersinia, pestis, some, viruses, can, cause, lifelong, or, chronic, infections, where, the, viruses, continue, to, replicate, in, the, body, despite, the, host, s, defence, mechanisms, this, is, common, in, hepatitis, b, virus, and, hepatitis, c, virus, infections, people, chronically, infected, are, known, as, carriers, as, they, serve, as, reservoirs, of, infectious, virus, in, populations, with, a, high, proportion, of, carriers, the, disease, is, said, to, be, endemic, viral, epidemiology, is, the, branch, of, medical, science, that, deals, with, the, transmission, and, control, of, virus, infections, in, humans, transmission, of, viruses, can, be, vertical, which, means, from, mother, to, child, or, horizontal, which, means, from, person, to, person, examples, of, vertical, transmission, include, hepatitis, b, virus, and, hiv, where, the, baby, is, born, already, infected, with, the, virus, another, more, rare, example, is, the, varicella, zoster, virus, which, although, causing, relatively, mild, infections, in, children, and, adults, can, be, fatal, to, the, foetus, and, newborn, baby, horizontal, transmission, is, the, most, common, mechanism, of, spread, of, viruses, in, populations, horizontal, transmission, can, occur, when, body, fluids, are, exchanged, during, sexual, activity, by, exchange, of, saliva, or, when, contaminated, food, or, water, is, ingested, it, can, also, occur, when, aerosols, containing, viruses, are, inhaled, or, by, insect, vectors, such, as, when, infected, mosquitoes, penetrate, the, skin, of, a, host, most, types, of, viruses, are, restricted, to, just, one, or, two, of, these, mechanisms, and, they, are, referred, to, as, respiratory, viruses, or, enteric, viruses, and, so, forth, the, rate, or, speed, of, transmission, of, viral, infections, depends, on, factors, that, include, population, density, the, number, of, susceptible, individuals, i, e, those, not, immune, the, quality, of, healthcare, and, the, weather, epidemiology, is, used, to, break, the, chain, of, infection, in, populations, during, outbreaks, of, viral, diseases, 264, control, measures, are, used, that, are, based, on, knowledge, of, how, the, virus, is, transmitted, it, is, important, to, find, the, source, or, sources, of, the, outbreak, and, to, identify, the, virus, once, the, virus, has, been, identified, the, chain, of, transmission, can, sometimes, be, broken, by, vaccines, when, vaccines, are, not, available, sanitation, and, disinfection, can, be, effective, often, infected, people, are, isolated, from, the, rest, of, the, community, and, those, that, have, been, exposed, to, the, virus, are, placed, in, quarantine, 894, to, control, the, outbreak, of, foot, and, mouth, disease, in, cattle, in, britain, in, 2001, thousands, of, cattle, were, slaughtered, most, viral, infections, of, humans, and, other, animals, have, incubation, periods, during, which, the, infection, causes, no, signs, or, symptoms, 170, incubation, periods, for, viral, diseases, range, from, a, few, days, to, weeks, but, are, known, for, most, infections, 170, 172, somewhat, overlapping, but, mainly, following, the, incubation, period, there, is, a, period, of, communicability, a, time, when, an, infected, individual, or, animal, is, contagious, and, can, infect, another, person, or, animal, 170, 172, this, too, is, known, for, many, viral, infections, and, knowledge, of, the, length, of, both, periods, is, important, in, the, control, of, outbreaks, 272, when, outbreaks, cause, an, unusually, high, proportion, of, cases, in, a, population, community, or, region, they, are, called, epidemics, if, outbreaks, spread, worldwide, they, are, called, pandemics, 891, a, pandemic, is, a, worldwide, epidemic, the, 1918, flu, pandemic, which, lasted, until, 1919, was, a, category, 5, influenza, pandemic, caused, by, an, unusually, severe, and, deadly, influenza, a, virus, the, victims, were, often, healthy, young, adults, in, contrast, to, most, influenza, outbreaks, which, predominantly, affect, juvenile, elderly, or, otherwise, weakened, patients, 409, 415, older, estimates, say, it, killed, 40, 50, million, people, while, more, recent, research, suggests, that, it, may, have, killed, as, many, as, 100, million, people, or, 5, of, the, world, s, population, in, 1918, although, viral, pandemics, are, rare, events, hiv, which, evolved, from, viruses, found, in, monkeys, and, chimpanzees, has, been, pandemic, since, at, least, the, 1980s, during, the, 20th, century, there, were, four, pandemics, caused, by, influenza, virus, and, those, that, occurred, in, 1918, 1957, and, 1968, were, severe, most, researchers, believe, that, hiv, originated, in, sub, saharan, africa, during, the, 20th, century, it, is, now, a, pandemic, with, an, estimated, 37, 9, million, people, now, living, with, the, disease, worldwide, there, were, about, 770, 000, deaths, from, aids, in, 2018, the, joint, united, nations, programme, on, hiv, aids, unaids, and, the, world, health, organization, who, estimate, that, aids, has, killed, more, than, 25, million, people, since, it, was, first, recognised, on, 5, june, 1981, making, it, one, of, the, most, destructive, epidemics, in, recorded, history, in, 2007, there, were, 2, 7, million, new, hiv, infections, and, 2, million, hiv, related, deaths, several, highly, lethal, viral, pathogens, are, members, of, the, filoviridae, filoviruses, are, filament, like, viruses, that, cause, viral, hemorrhagic, fever, and, include, ebolaviruses, and, marburgviruses, marburg, virus, first, discovered, in, 1967, attracted, widespread, press, attention, in, april, 2005, for, an, outbreak, in, angola, ebola, virus, disease, has, also, caused, intermittent, outbreaks, with, high, mortality, rates, since, 1976, when, it, was, first, identified, the, worst, and, most, recent, one, is, the, 2013, 2016, west, africa, epidemic, except, for, smallpox, most, pandemics, are, caused, by, newly, evolved, viruses, these, emergent, viruses, are, usually, mutants, of, less, harmful, viruses, that, have, circulated, previously, either, in, humans, or, other, animals, severe, acute, respiratory, syndrome, sars, and, middle, east, respiratory, syndrome, mers, are, caused, by, new, types, of, coronaviruses, other, coronaviruses, are, known, to, cause, mild, infections, in, humans, so, the, virulence, and, rapid, spread, of, sars, infections, that, by, july, 2003, had, caused, around, 8, 000, cases, and, 800, deaths, was, unexpected, and, most, countries, were, not, prepared, a, related, coronavirus, severe, acute, respiratory, syndrome, coronavirus, 2, sars, cov, 2, thought, to, have, originated, in, bats, emerged, in, wuhan, china, in, november, 2019, and, spread, rapidly, around, the, world, infections, with, the, virus, caused, the, covid, 19, pandemic, that, started, in, 2020, unprecedented, restrictions, in, peacetime, were, placed, on, international, travel, and, curfews, were, imposed, in, several, major, cities, worldwide, in, response, to, the, pandemic, viruses, are, an, established, cause, of, cancer, in, humans, and, other, species, viral, cancers, occur, only, in, a, minority, of, infected, persons, or, animals, cancer, viruses, come, from, a, range, of, virus, families, including, both, rna, and, dna, viruses, and, so, there, is, no, single, type, of, oncovirus, an, obsolete, term, originally, used, for, acutely, transforming, retroviruses, the, development, of, cancer, is, determined, by, a, variety, of, factors, such, as, host, immunity, and, mutations, in, the, host, viruses, accepted, to, cause, human, cancers, include, some, genotypes, of, human, papillomavirus, hepatitis, b, virus, hepatitis, c, virus, epstein, barr, virus, kaposi, s, sarcoma, associated, herpesvirus, and, human, t, lymphotropic, virus, the, most, recently, discovered, human, cancer, virus, is, a, polyomavirus, merkel, cell, polyomavirus, that, causes, most, cases, of, a, rare, form, of, skin, cancer, called, merkel, cell, carcinoma, hepatitis, viruses, can, develop, into, a, chronic, viral, infection, that, leads, to, liver, cancer, infection, by, human, t, lymphotropic, virus, can, lead, to, tropical, spastic, paraparesis, and, adult, t, cell, leukaemia, human, papillomaviruses, are, an, established, cause, of, cancers, of, cervix, skin, anus, and, penis, within, the, herpesviridae, kaposi, s, sarcoma, associated, herpesvirus, causes, kaposi, s, sarcoma, and, body, cavity, lymphoma, and, epstein, barr, virus, causes, burkitt, s, lymphoma, hodgkin, s, lymphoma, b, lymphoproliferative, disorder, and, nasopharyngeal, carcinoma, merkel, cell, polyomavirus, closely, related, to, sv40, and, mouse, polyomaviruses, that, have, been, used, as, animal, models, for, cancer, viruses, for, over, 50, years, the, body, s, first, line, of, defence, against, viruses, is, the, innate, immune, system, this, comprises, cells, and, other, mechanisms, that, defend, the, host, from, infection, in, a, non, specific, manner, this, means, that, the, cells, of, the, innate, system, recognise, and, respond, to, pathogens, in, a, generic, way, but, unlike, the, adaptive, immune, system, it, does, not, confer, long, lasting, or, protective, immunity, to, the, host, rna, interference, is, an, important, innate, defence, against, viruses, many, viruses, have, a, replication, strategy, that, involves, double, stranded, rna, dsrna, when, such, a, virus, infects, a, cell, it, releases, its, rna, molecule, or, molecules, which, immediately, bind, to, a, protein, complex, called, a, dicer, that, cuts, the, rna, into, smaller, pieces, a, biochemical, pathway, the, risc, complex, is, activated, which, ensures, cell, survival, by, degrading, the, viral, mrna, rotaviruses, have, evolved, to, avoid, this, defence, mechanism, by, not, uncoating, fully, inside, the, cell, and, releasing, newly, produced, mrna, through, pores, in, the, particle, s, inner, capsid, their, genomic, dsrna, remains, protected, inside, the, core, of, the, virion, when, the, adaptive, immune, system, of, a, vertebrate, encounters, a, virus, it, produces, specific, antibodies, that, bind, to, the, virus, and, often, render, it, non, infectious, this, is, called, humoral, immunity, two, types, of, antibodies, are, important, the, first, called, igm, is, highly, effective, at, neutralising, viruses, but, is, produced, by, the, cells, of, the, immune, system, only, for, a, few, weeks, the, second, called, igg, is, produced, indefinitely, the, presence, of, igm, in, the, blood, of, the, host, is, used, to, test, for, acute, infection, whereas, igg, indicates, an, infection, sometime, in, the, past, igg, antibody, is, measured, when, tests, for, immunity, are, carried, out, antibodies, can, continue, to, be, an, effective, defence, mechanism, even, after, viruses, have, managed, to, gain, entry, to, the, host, cell, a, protein, that, is, in, cells, called, trim21, can, attach, to, the, antibodies, on, the, surface, of, the, virus, particle, this, primes, the, subsequent, destruction, of, the, virus, by, the, enzymes, of, the, cell, s, proteosome, system, a, second, defence, of, vertebrates, against, viruses, is, called, cell, mediated, immunity, and, involves, immune, cells, known, as, t, cells, the, body, s, cells, constantly, display, short, fragments, of, their, proteins, on, the, cell, s, surface, and, if, a, t, cell, recognises, a, suspicious, viral, fragment, there, the, host, cell, is, destroyed, by, killer, t, cells, and, the, virus, specific, t, cells, proliferate, cells, such, as, the, macrophage, are, specialists, at, this, antigen, presentation, the, production, of, interferon, is, an, important, host, defence, mechanism, this, is, a, hormone, produced, by, the, body, when, viruses, are, present, its, role, in, immunity, is, complex, it, eventually, stops, the, viruses, from, reproducing, by, killing, the, infected, cell, and, its, close, neighbours, not, all, virus, infections, produce, a, protective, immune, response, in, this, way, hiv, evades, the, immune, system, by, constantly, changing, the, amino, acid, sequence, of, the, proteins, on, the, surface, of, the, virion, this, is, known, as, escape, mutation, as, the, viral, epitopes, escape, recognition, by, the, host, immune, response, these, persistent, viruses, evade, immune, control, by, sequestration, blockade, of, antigen, presentation, cytokine, resistance, evasion, of, natural, killer, cell, activities, escape, from, apoptosis, and, antigenic, shift, other, viruses, called, neurotropic, viruses, are, disseminated, by, neural, spread, where, the, immune, system, may, be, unable, to, reach, them, due, to, immune, privilege, because, viruses, use, vital, metabolic, pathways, within, host, cells, to, replicate, they, are, difficult, to, eliminate, without, using, drugs, that, cause, toxic, effects, to, host, cells, in, general, the, most, effective, medical, approaches, to, viral, diseases, are, vaccinations, to, provide, immunity, to, infection, and, antiviral, drugs, that, selectively, interfere, with, viral, replication, vaccination, is, a, cheap, and, effective, way, of, preventing, infections, by, viruses, vaccines, were, used, to, prevent, viral, infections, long, before, the, discovery, of, the, actual, viruses, their, use, has, resulted, in, a, dramatic, decline, in, morbidity, illness, and, mortality, death, associated, with, viral, infections, such, as, polio, measles, mumps, and, rubella, smallpox, infections, have, been, eradicated, vaccines, are, available, to, prevent, over, thirteen, viral, infections, of, humans, and, more, are, used, to, prevent, viral, infections, of, animals, vaccines, can, consist, of, live, attenuated, or, killed, viruses, viral, proteins, antigens, or, rna, live, vaccines, contain, weakened, forms, of, the, virus, which, do, not, cause, the, disease, but, nonetheless, confer, immunity, such, viruses, are, called, attenuated, live, vaccines, can, be, dangerous, when, given, to, people, with, a, weak, immunity, who, are, described, as, immunocompromised, because, in, these, people, the, weakened, virus, can, cause, the, original, disease, biotechnology, and, genetic, engineering, techniques, are, used, to, produce, subunit, vaccines, these, vaccines, use, only, the, capsid, proteins, of, the, virus, hepatitis, b, vaccine, is, an, example, of, this, type, of, vaccine, subunit, vaccines, are, safe, for, immunocompromised, patients, because, they, cannot, cause, the, disease, the, yellow, fever, virus, vaccine, a, live, attenuated, strain, called, 17d, is, probably, the, safest, and, most, effective, vaccine, ever, generated, antiviral, drugs, are, often, nucleoside, analogues, fake, dna, building, blocks, which, viruses, mistakenly, incorporate, into, their, genomes, during, replication, the, life, cycle, of, the, virus, is, then, halted, because, the, newly, synthesised, dna, is, inactive, this, is, because, these, analogues, lack, the, hydroxyl, groups, which, along, with, phosphorus, atoms, link, together, to, form, the, strong, backbone, of, the, dna, molecule, this, is, called, dna, chain, termination, examples, of, nucleoside, analogues, are, aciclovir, for, herpes, simplex, virus, infections, and, lamivudine, for, hiv, and, hepatitis, b, virus, infections, aciclovir, is, one, of, the, oldest, and, most, frequently, prescribed, antiviral, drugs, other, antiviral, drugs, in, use, target, different, stages, of, the, viral, life, cycle, hiv, is, dependent, on, a, proteolytic, enzyme, called, the, hiv, 1, protease, for, it, to, become, fully, infectious, there, is, a, large, class, of, drugs, called, protease, inhibitors, that, inactivate, this, enzyme, there, are, around, thirteen, classes, of, antiviral, drugs, each, targeting, different, viruses, or, stages, of, viral, replication, hepatitis, c, is, caused, by, an, rna, virus, in, 80, of, people, infected, the, disease, is, chronic, and, without, treatment, they, are, infected, for, the, remainder, of, their, lives, there, are, effective, treatments, that, use, direct, acting, antivirals, the, treatment, of, chronic, carriers, of, the, hepatitis, b, virus, has, also, been, developed, by, using, similar, strategies, that, include, lamivudine, and, other, anti, viral, drugs, viruses, infect, all, cellular, life, and, although, viruses, occur, universally, each, cellular, species, has, its, own, specific, range, that, often, infects, only, that, species, 3, some, viruses, called, satellites, can, replicate, only, within, cells, that, have, already, been, infected, by, another, virus, viruses, are, important, pathogens, of, livestock, diseases, such, as, foot, and, mouth, disease, and, bluetongue, are, caused, by, viruses, companion, animals, such, as, cats, dogs, and, horses, if, not, vaccinated, are, susceptible, to, serious, viral, infections, canine, parvovirus, is, caused, by, a, small, dna, virus, and, infections, are, often, fatal, in, pups, like, all, invertebrates, the, honey, bee, is, susceptible, to, many, viral, infections, most, viruses, co, exist, harmlessly, in, their, host, and, cause, no, signs, or, symptoms, of, disease, 4, there, are, many, types, of, plant, viruses, but, often, they, cause, only, a, loss, of, yield, and, it, is, not, economically, viable, to, try, to, control, them, plant, viruses, are, often, spread, from, plant, to, plant, by, organisms, known, as, vectors, these, are, usually, insects, but, some, fungi, nematode, worms, single, celled, organisms, and, parasitic, plants, are, vectors, when, control, of, plant, virus, infections, is, considered, economical, for, perennial, fruits, for, example, efforts, are, concentrated, on, killing, the, vectors, and, removing, alternate, hosts, such, as, weeds, 802, plant, viruses, cannot, infect, humans, and, other, animals, because, they, can, reproduce, only, in, living, plant, cells, 799, 807, originally, from, peru, the, potato, has, become, a, staple, crop, worldwide, the, potato, virus, y, causes, disease, in, potatoes, and, related, species, including, tomatoes, and, peppers, in, the, 1980s, this, virus, acquired, economical, importance, when, it, proved, difficult, to, control, in, seed, potato, crops, transmitted, by, aphids, this, virus, can, reduce, crop, yields, by, up, to, 80, per, cent, causing, significant, losses, to, potato, yields, plants, have, elaborate, and, effective, defence, mechanisms, against, viruses, one, of, the, most, effective, is, the, presence, of, so, called, resistance, r, genes, each, r, gene, confers, resistance, to, a, particular, virus, by, triggering, localised, areas, of, cell, death, around, the, infected, cell, which, can, often, be, seen, with, the, unaided, eye, as, large, spots, this, stops, the, infection, from, spreading, rna, interference, is, also, an, effective, defence, in, plants, 809, when, they, are, infected, plants, often, produce, natural, disinfectants, that, kill, viruses, such, as, salicylic, acid, nitric, oxide, and, reactive, oxygen, molecules, plant, virus, particles, or, virus, like, particles, vlps, have, applications, in, both, biotechnology, and, nanotechnology, the, capsids, of, most, plant, viruses, are, simple, and, robust, structures, and, can, be, produced, in, large, quantities, either, by, the, infection, of, plants, or, by, expression, in, a, variety, of, heterologous, systems, plant, virus, particles, can, be, modified, genetically, and, chemically, to, encapsulate, foreign, material, and, can, be, incorporated, into, supramolecular, structures, for, use, in, biotechnology, bacteriophages, are, a, common, and, diverse, group, of, viruses, and, are, the, most, abundant, biological, entity, in, aquatic, environments, there, are, up, to, ten, times, more, of, these, viruses, in, the, oceans, than, there, are, bacteria, reaching, levels, of, 250, 000, 000, bacteriophages, per, millilitre, of, seawater, these, viruses, infect, specific, bacteria, by, binding, to, surface, receptor, molecules, and, then, entering, the, cell, within, a, short, amount, of, time, in, some, cases, just, minutes, bacterial, polymerase, starts, translating, viral, mrna, into, protein, these, proteins, go, on, to, become, either, new, virions, within, the, cell, helper, proteins, which, help, assembly, of, new, virions, or, proteins, involved, in, cell, lysis, viral, enzymes, aid, in, the, breakdown, of, the, cell, membrane, and, in, the, case, of, the, t4, phage, in, just, over, twenty, minutes, after, injection, over, three, hundred, phages, could, be, released, 834, 835, the, major, way, bacteria, defend, themselves, from, bacteriophages, is, by, producing, enzymes, that, destroy, foreign, dna, these, enzymes, called, restriction, endonucleases, cut, up, the, viral, dna, that, bacteriophages, inject, into, bacterial, cells, bacteria, also, contain, a, system, that, uses, crispr, sequences, to, retain, fragments, of, the, genomes, of, viruses, that, the, bacteria, have, come, into, contact, with, previously, which, allows, them, to, block, the, virus, s, replication, through, a, form, of, rna, interference, this, genetic, system, provides, bacteria, with, acquired, immunity, to, infection, some, bacteriophages, are, called, temperate, because, they, cause, latent, infections, and, do, not, immediately, destroy, their, host, cells, instead, their, dna, is, incorporated, with, the, host, cell, s, as, a, prophage, these, latent, infections, become, productive, when, the, prophage, dna, is, activated, by, stimuli, such, as, changes, in, the, environment, the, intestines, of, animals, including, humans, contain, temperate, bacteriophages, which, are, activated, by, various, stimuli, including, changes, in, diet, and, antibiotics, although, first, observed, in, bacteriophages, many, other, viruses, are, known, to, form, proviruses, including, hiv, some, viruses, replicate, within, archaea, these, are, dna, viruses, with, unusual, and, sometimes, unique, shapes, these, viruses, have, been, studied, in, most, detail, in, the, thermophilic, archaea, particularly, the, orders, sulfolobales, and, thermoproteales, defences, against, these, viruses, involve, rna, interference, from, repetitive, dna, sequences, within, archaean, genomes, that, are, related, to, the, genes, of, the, viruses, most, archaea, have, crispr, cas, systems, as, an, adaptive, defence, against, viruses, these, enable, archaea, to, retain, sections, of, viral, dna, which, are, then, used, to, target, and, eliminate, subsequent, infections, by, the, virus, using, a, process, similar, to, rna, interference, viruses, are, the, most, abundant, biological, entity, in, aquatic, environments, there, are, about, ten, million, of, them, in, a, teaspoon, of, seawater, most, of, these, viruses, are, bacteriophages, infecting, heterotrophic, bacteria, and, cyanophages, infecting, cyanobacteria, and, they, are, essential, to, the, regulation, of, saltwater, and, freshwater, ecosystems, bacteriophages, are, harmless, to, plants, and, animals, and, are, essential, to, the, regulation, of, marine, and, freshwater, ecosystems, are, important, mortality, agents, of, phytoplankton, the, base, of, the, foodchain, in, aquatic, environments, they, infect, and, destroy, bacteria, in, aquatic, microbial, communities, and, are, one, of, the, most, important, mechanisms, of, recycling, carbon, and, nutrient, cycling, in, marine, environments, the, organic, molecules, released, from, the, dead, bacterial, cells, stimulate, fresh, bacterial, and, algal, growth, in, a, process, known, as, the, viral, shunt, in, particular, lysis, of, bacteria, by, viruses, has, been, shown, to, enhance, nitrogen, cycling, and, stimulate, phytoplankton, growth, viral, activity, may, also, affect, the, biological, pump, the, process, whereby, carbon, is, sequestered, in, the, deep, ocean, microorganisms, constitute, more, than, 90, of, the, biomass, in, the, sea, it, is, estimated, that, viruses, kill, approximately, 20, of, this, biomass, each, day, and, that, there, are, 10, to, 15, times, as, many, viruses, in, the, oceans, as, there, are, bacteria, and, archaea, viruses, are, also, major, agents, responsible, for, the, destruction, of, phytoplankton, including, harmful, algal, blooms, the, number, of, viruses, in, the, oceans, decreases, further, offshore, and, deeper, into, the, water, where, there, are, fewer, host, organisms, in, january, 2018, scientists, reported, that, 800, million, viruses, mainly, of, marine, origin, are, deposited, daily, from, the, earth, s, atmosphere, onto, every, square, meter, of, the, planet, s, surface, as, the, result, of, a, global, atmospheric, stream, of, viruses, circulating, above, the, weather, system, but, below, the, altitude, of, usual, airline, travel, distributing, viruses, around, the, planet, like, any, organism, marine, mammals, are, susceptible, to, viral, infections, in, 1988, and, 2002, thousands, of, harbour, seals, were, killed, in, europe, by, phocine, distemper, virus, many, other, viruses, including, caliciviruses, herpesviruses, adenoviruses, and, parvoviruses, circulate, in, marine, mammal, populations, in, december, 2022, scientists, reported, the, first, observation, of, virovory, via, an, experiment, on, pond, water, containing, chlorovirus, which, commonly, infects, green, algae, in, freshwater, environments, when, all, other, microbial, food, sources, were, removed, from, the, water, the, ciliate, halteria, was, observed, to, have, increased, in, number, due, to, the, active, consumption, of, chlorovirus, as, a, food, source, instead, of, its, typical, bacterivore, diet, viruses, are, an, important, natural, means, of, transferring, genes, between, different, species, which, increases, genetic, diversity, and, drives, evolution, it, is, thought, that, viruses, played, a, central, role, in, early, evolution, before, the, diversification, of, the, last, universal, common, ancestor, into, bacteria, archaea, and, eukaryotes, viruses, are, still, one, of, the, largest, reservoirs, of, unexplored, genetic, diversity, on, earth, viruses, are, important, to, the, study, of, molecular, and, cell, biology, as, they, provide, simple, systems, that, can, be, used, to, manipulate, and, investigate, the, functions, of, cells, 8, the, study, and, use, of, viruses, have, provided, valuable, information, about, aspects, of, cell, biology, for, example, viruses, have, been, useful, in, the, study, of, genetics, and, helped, our, understanding, of, the, basic, mechanisms, of, molecular, genetics, such, as, dna, replication, transcription, rna, processing, translation, protein, transport, and, immunology, geneticists, often, use, viruses, as, vectors, to, introduce, genes, into, cells, that, they, are, studying, this, is, useful, for, making, the, cell, produce, a, foreign, substance, or, to, study, the, effect, of, introducing, a, new, gene, into, the, genome, similarly, virotherapy, uses, viruses, as, vectors, to, treat, various, diseases, as, they, can, specifically, target, cells, and, dna, it, shows, promising, use, in, the, treatment, of, cancer, and, in, gene, therapy, eastern, european, scientists, have, used, phage, therapy, as, an, alternative, to, antibiotics, for, some, time, and, interest, in, this, approach, is, increasing, because, of, the, high, level, of, antibiotic, resistance, now, found, in, some, pathogenic, bacteria, the, expression, of, heterologous, proteins, by, viruses, is, the, basis, of, several, manufacturing, processes, that, are, currently, being, used, for, the, production, of, various, proteins, such, as, vaccine, antigens, and, antibodies, industrial, processes, have, been, recently, developed, using, viral, vectors, and, several, pharmaceutical, proteins, are, currently, in, pre, clinical, and, clinical, trials, virotherapy, involves, the, use, of, genetically, modified, viruses, to, treat, diseases, viruses, have, been, modified, by, scientists, to, reproduce, in, cancer, cells, and, destroy, them, but, not, infect, healthy, cells, talimogene, laherparepvec, t, vec, for, example, is, a, modified, herpes, simplex, virus, that, has, had, a, gene, which, is, required, for, viruses, to, replicate, in, healthy, cells, deleted, and, replaced, with, a, human, gene, gm, csf, that, stimulates, immunity, when, this, virus, infects, cancer, cells, it, destroys, them, and, in, doing, so, the, presence, the, gm, csf, gene, attracts, dendritic, cells, from, the, surrounding, tissues, of, the, body, the, dendritic, cells, process, the, dead, cancer, cells, and, present, components, of, them, to, other, cells, of, the, immune, system, having, completed, successful, clinical, trials, the, virus, gained, approval, for, the, treatment, of, melanoma, in, late, 2015, viruses, that, have, been, reprogrammed, to, kill, cancer, cells, are, called, oncolytic, viruses, from, the, viewpoint, of, a, materials, scientist, viruses, can, be, regarded, as, organic, nanoparticles, their, surface, carries, specific, tools, that, enable, them, to, cross, the, barriers, of, their, host, cells, the, size, and, shape, of, viruses, and, the, number, and, nature, of, the, functional, groups, on, their, surface, are, precisely, defined, as, such, viruses, are, commonly, used, in, materials, science, as, scaffolds, for, covalently, linked, surface, modifications, a, particular, quality, of, viruses, is, that, they, can, be, tailored, by, directed, evolution, the, powerful, techniques, developed, by, life, sciences, are, becoming, the, basis, of, engineering, approaches, towards, nanomaterials, opening, a, wide, range, of, applications, far, beyond, biology, and, medicine, because, of, their, size, shape, and, well, defined, chemical, structures, viruses, have, been, used, as, templates, for, organising, materials, on, the, nanoscale, examples, include, the, work, at, the, naval, research, laboratory, in, washington, d, c, using, cowpea, mosaic, virus, cpmv, particles, to, amplify, signals, in, dna, microarray, based, sensors, in, this, application, the, virus, particles, separate, the, fluorescent, dyes, used, for, signalling, to, prevent, the, formation, of, non, fluorescent, dimers, that, act, as, quenchers, another, example, is, the, use, of, cpmv, as, a, nanoscale, breadboard, for, molecular, electronics, many, viruses, can, be, synthesised, de, novo, from, scratch, the, first, synthetic, virus, was, created, in, 2002, although, somewhat, of, a, misconception, it, is, not, the, actual, virus, that, is, synthesised, but, rather, its, dna, genome, in, case, of, a, dna, virus, or, a, cdna, copy, of, its, genome, in, case, of, rna, viruses, for, many, virus, families, the, naked, synthetic, dna, or, rna, once, enzymatically, converted, back, from, the, synthetic, cdna, is, infectious, when, introduced, into, a, cell, that, is, they, contain, all, the, necessary, information, to, produce, new, viruses, this, technology, is, now, being, used, to, investigate, novel, vaccine, strategies, the, ability, to, synthesise, viruses, has, far, reaching, consequences, since, viruses, can, no, longer, be, regarded, as, extinct, as, long, as, the, information, of, their, genome, sequence, is, known, and, permissive, cells, are, available, as, of, june, 2021, the, full, length, genome, sequences, of, 11, 464, different, viruses, including, smallpox, are, publicly, available, in, an, online, database, maintained, by, the, national, institutes, of, health, the, ability, of, viruses, to, cause, devastating, epidemics, in, human, societies, has, led, to, the, concern, that, viruses, could, be, weaponised, for, biological, warfare, further, concern, was, raised, by, the, successful, recreation, of, the, infamous, 1918, influenza, virus, in, a, laboratory, the, smallpox, virus, devastated, numerous, societies, throughout, history, before, its, eradication, there, are, only, two, centres, in, the, world, authorised, by, the, who, to, keep, stocks, of, smallpox, virus, the, state, research, center, of, virology, and, biotechnology, vector, in, russia, and, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, in, the, united, states, it, may, be, used, as, a, weapon, as, the, vaccine, for, smallpox, sometimes, had, severe, side, effects, it, is, no, longer, used, routinely, in, any, country, thus, much, of, the, modern, human, population, has, almost, no, established, resistance, to, smallpox, and, would, be, vulnerable, to, the, virus
