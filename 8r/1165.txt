boletus, edulis, english, cep, penny, bun, porcino, or, porcini, is, a, basidiomycete, fungus, and, the, type, species, of, the, genus, boletus, widely, distributed, in, the, northern, hemisphere, across, europe, asia, and, north, america, it, does, not, occur, naturally, in, the, southern, hemisphere, although, it, has, been, introduced, to, southern, africa, australia, new, zealand, and, brazil, several, closely, related, european, mushrooms, formerly, thought, to, be, varieties, or, forms, of, b, edulis, have, been, shown, using, molecular, phylogenetic, analysis, to, be, distinct, species, and, others, previously, classed, as, separate, species, are, conspecific, with, this, species, the, western, north, american, species, commonly, known, as, the, california, king, bolete, boletus, edulis, var, grandedulis, is, a, large, darker, coloured, variant, first, formally, identified, in, 2007, the, fungus, grows, in, deciduous, and, coniferous, forests, and, tree, plantations, forming, symbiotic, ectomycorrhizal, associations, with, living, trees, by, enveloping, the, tree, s, underground, roots, with, sheaths, of, fungal, tissue, the, fungus, produces, spore, bearing, fruit, bodies, above, ground, in, summer, and, autumn, the, fruit, body, has, a, large, brown, cap, which, on, occasion, can, reach, 30, cm, 12, in, rarely, 40, cm, 16, in, in, diameter, and, 3, kg, 6, lb, 10, oz, in, weight, like, other, boletes, it, has, tubes, extending, downward, from, the, underside, of, the, cap, rather, than, gills, spores, escape, at, maturity, through, the, tube, openings, or, pores, the, pore, surface, of, the, b, edulis, fruit, body, is, whitish, when, young, but, ages, to, a, greenish, yellow, the, stout, stipe, or, stem, is, white, or, yellowish, in, colour, up, to, 20, cm, 8, in, rarely, 30, cm, 12, in, tall, and, 10, cm, 4, in, thick, and, partially, covered, with, a, raised, network, pattern, or, reticulations, prized, as, an, ingredient, in, various, culinary, dishes, b, edulis, is, an, edible, mushroom, held, in, high, regard, in, many, cuisines, and, is, commonly, prepared, and, eaten, in, soups, pasta, or, risotto, the, mushroom, is, low, in, fat, and, digestible, carbohydrates, and, high, in, protein, vitamins, minerals, and, dietary, fibre, although, it, is, sold, commercially, it, is, very, difficult, to, cultivate, available, fresh, in, autumn, throughout, europe, and, russia, it, is, most, often, dried, packaged, and, distributed, worldwide, it, keeps, its, flavour, after, drying, and, it, is, then, reconstituted, and, used, in, cooking, b, edulis, is, also, one, of, the, few, fungi, sold, pickled, boletus, edulis, was, first, described, in, 1782, by, the, french, botanist, pierre, bulliard, and, still, bears, its, original, name, the, starting, date, of, fungal, taxonomy, had, been, set, as, january, 1, 1821, to, coincide, with, the, date, of, the, works, of, the, father, of, mycology, swedish, naturalist, elias, magnus, fries, which, meant, the, name, required, sanction, by, fries, indicated, in, the, name, by, a, colon, to, be, considered, valid, as, bulliard, s, work, preceded, this, date, it, was, thus, written, boletus, edulis, bull, fr, a, 1987, revision, of, the, international, code, of, botanical, nomenclature, set, the, starting, date, at, may, 1, 1753, the, date, of, publication, of, linnaeus, work, the, species, plantarum, hence, the, name, no, longer, requires, the, ratification, of, fries, authority, early, alternate, names, include, boletus, solidus, by, english, naturalist, james, sowerby, in, 1809, and, gray, s, leccinum, edule, gray, s, transfer, of, the, species, to, leccinum, was, later, determined, to, be, inconsistent, with, the, rules, of, botanical, nomenclature, and, he, apparently, was, unfamiliar, with, the, earlier, works, of, fries, when, he, published, his, arrangement, of, bolete, species, boletus, edulis, is, the, type, species, of, the, genus, boletus, in, rolf, singer, s, classification, of, the, agaricales, mushrooms, it, is, also, the, type, species, of, section, boletus, a, grouping, of, about, 30, related, boletes, united, by, several, characteristics, a, mild, tasting, white, flesh, that, does, not, change, colour, when, exposed, to, air, a, smooth, to, distinctly, raised, netted, pattern, over, at, least, the, uppermost, portion, of, the, stem, a, yellow, brown, or, olive, brown, spore, print, white, tubes, that, later, become, yellowish, then, greenish, which, initially, appear, to, be, stuffed, with, cotton, and, cystidia, that, are, not, strongly, coloured, molecular, analysis, published, in, 1997, established, that, the, bolete, mushrooms, are, all, derived, from, a, common, ancestor, and, established, the, boletales, as, an, order, separate, from, the, agaricales, the, generic, name, is, derived, from, the, latin, term, b, l, tus, mushroom, which, was, borrowed, in, turn, from, the, ancient, greek, terrestrial, fungus, ultimately, this, last, word, derives, from, b, los, lump, clod, and, metaphorically, mushroom, the, of, galen, like, the, boletus, of, latin, writers, like, martial, seneca, and, petronius, is, often, identified, as, the, much, prized, amanita, caesarea, the, specific, epithet, edulis, in, latin, means, eatable, or, edible, common, names, for, b, edulis, vary, by, region, the, standard, italian, name, porcino, pl, porcini, means, porcine, fungo, porcino, in, italian, echoes, the, term, suilli, literally, hog, mushrooms, a, term, used, by, the, ancient, romans, and, still, in, use, in, southern, italian, terms, for, this, species, the, derivation, has, been, ascribed, to, the, resemblance, of, young, fruit, bodies, to, piglets, or, to, the, fondness, pigs, have, for, eating, them, it, is, also, known, as, king, bolete, the, english, penny, bun, refers, to, its, rounded, brownish, shape, the, german, name, steinpilz, stone, mushroom, refers, to, the, species, firm, flesh, in, austria, it, is, called, herrenpilz, the, noble, mushroom, while, in, mexico, the, spanish, name, is, panza, meaning, belly, another, spanish, name, rodellon, means, small, round, boulder, while, the, dutch, name, eekhoorntjesbrood, means, squirrel, s, bread, russian, names, are, belyy, grib, ru, white, mushroom, as, opposed, to, less, valuable, black, mushrooms, and, borovik, ru, from, bor, pine, forest, the, vernacular, name, cep, is, derived, from, the, catalan, cep, or, its, french, name, c, pe, although, the, latter, is, a, generic, term, applying, to, several, related, species, in, france, it, is, more, fully, c, pe, de, bordeaux, derived, from, the, gascon, cep, trunk, for, its, fat, stalk, ultimately, from, the, latin, cippus, stake, ceppatello, ceppatello, buono, ceppatello, bianco, giallo, leonato, ghezzo, and, moreccio, are, names, from, italian, dialects, and, ciurenys, or, surenys, is, another, term, in, catalan, the, french, born, king, charles, xiv, john, popularised, b, edulis, in, sweden, after, 1818, and, is, honoured, in, the, local, vernacular, name, karljohanssvamp, as, well, as, the, danish, name, karl, johan, svamp, the, monarch, cultivated, the, fungus, about, his, residence, rosersberg, palace, the, finnish, name, is, herkkutatti, from, herkku, delicacy, and, tatti, bolete, the, cap, of, this, mushroom, is, 7, 30, cm, 3, 12, in, broad, at, maturity, slightly, sticky, to, touch, it, is, convex, in, shape, when, young, and, flattens, with, age, the, colour, is, generally, reddish, brown, fading, to, white, in, areas, near, the, margin, and, continues, to, darken, as, it, matures, the, stipe, or, stem, is, 8, 25, cm, 3, 10, in, in, height, and, up, to, 7, cm, 3, in, thick, rather, large, in, comparison, to, the, cap, it, is, club, shaped, or, bulges, out, in, the, middle, it, is, finely, reticulate, on, the, upper, portion, but, smooth, or, irregularly, ridged, on, the, lower, part, the, under, surface, of, the, cap, is, made, of, thin, tubes, the, site, of, spore, production, they, are, 1, to, 2, cm, 1, 2, to, 3, 4, in, deep, and, whitish, in, colour, when, young, but, mature, to, a, greenish, yellow, the, angular, pores, which, do, not, stain, when, bruised, are, small, roughly, 2, to, 3, pores, per, millimetre, in, youth, the, pores, are, white, and, appear, as, if, stuffed, with, cotton, which, are, actually, mycelia, as, they, age, they, change, colour, to, yellow, and, later, to, brown, the, spore, print, is, olive, brown, the, flesh, of, the, fruit, body, is, white, thick, and, firm, when, young, but, becomes, somewhat, spongy, with, age, when, bruised, or, cut, it, either, does, not, change, colour, or, turns, a, very, light, brown, or, light, red, fully, mature, specimens, can, weigh, about, 1, kg, 2, lb, 3, oz, a, huge, specimen, collected, on, the, isle, of, skye, scotland, in, 1995, bore, a, cap, of, 42, cm, 16, 1, 2, in, with, a, stipe, 18, cm, 7, in, in, height, and, 14, cm, 5, 1, 2, in, wide, and, weighed, 3, 2, kg, 7, lb, 1, oz, a, similarly, sized, specimen, found, in, poland, in, 2013, made, international, news, boletus, edulis, is, considered, one, of, the, safest, wild, mushrooms, to, pick, for, the, table, as, few, poisonous, species, closely, resemble, it, and, those, that, do, may, be, easily, distinguished, by, careful, examination, the, most, similar, poisonous, mushroom, may, be, the, devil, s, bolete, rubroboletus, satanas, which, has, a, similar, shape, but, has, a, red, stem, and, stains, blue, on, bruising, it, is, often, confused, with, the, very, bitter, and, unpalatable, tylopilus, felleus, but, can, be, distinguished, by, the, reticulation, on, the, stalk, in, porcini, it, is, a, whitish, net, like, pattern, on, a, brownish, stalk, whereas, it, is, a, dark, pattern, on, white, in, the, latter, porcini, have, whitish, pores, while, the, other, has, pink, if, in, doubt, tasting, a, tiny, bit, of, flesh, will, yield, a, bitter, taste, it, can, also, resemble, the, bolete, like, gyroporus, castaneus, which, is, generally, smaller, and, has, a, browner, stem, boletus, huronensis, an, uncommon, mushroom, of, northeastern, north, america, is, another, recognized, look, alike, known, to, cause, severe, gastrointestinal, disorders, the, spores, are, elliptical, to, spindle, shaped, with, dimensions, of, 12, 17, by, 5, 7, m, the, basidia, the, spore, bearing, cells, are, produced, in, a, layer, lining, the, tubes, and, arrange, themselves, so, their, ends, are, facing, the, center, of, the, tube, this, layer, of, cells, is, known, technically, as, a, hymenium, the, basidia, are, thin, walled, mostly, attached, to, four, spores, and, measure, 25, 30, by, 8, 10, m, another, cell, type, present, in, the, hymenium, is, the, cystidia, larger, sterile, cells, that, protrude, beyond, the, basidia, into, the, lumen, of, the, hymenium, and, act, as, air, traps, regulating, humidity, b, edulis, has, pleurocystidia, cystidia, located, on, the, face, of, a, pore, that, are, thin, walled, roughly, spindle, shaped, to, ventricose, and, measure, 30, 45, by, 7, 10, m, the, stuffed, feature, of, the, hymenium, is, caused, by, cheilocystidia, cells, found, on, the, edges, of, the, pores, the, hyphae, of, b, edulis, do, not, have, clamp, connections, several, similar, brownish, coloured, species, are, sometimes, considered, subspecies, or, forms, of, this, mushroom, in, europe, in, addition, to, b, edulis, or, c, pe, de, bordeaux, the, most, popular, are, molecular, phylogenetic, analyses, have, proven, these, three, are, all, distinctive, and, separate, species, other, taxa, formerly, believed, to, be, unique, species, or, subspecies, such, as, b, betulicola, b, chippewaensis, b, persoonii, b, quercicola, and, b, venturii, are, now, known, to, be, part, of, a, b, edulis, species, complex, with, a, wide, morphological, ecological, and, geographic, range, and, that, the, genetic, variability, in, this, complex, is, low, similar, molecular, technology, has, been, developed, to, rapidly, and, accurately, identify, b, edulis, and, other, commercially, important, fungi, three, divergent, lineages, found, in, yunnan, province, in, china, that, are, commonly, marketed, and, sold, as, b, edulis, and, are, actually, more, closely, related, to, b, aereus, were, described, in, 2013, as, b, bainiugan, b, meiweiniuganjun, and, b, shiyong, the, classification, has, since, been, updated, and, expanded, all, lineages, are, still, members, of, boletus, sect, boletus, the, sensu, sticto, porcini, clade, of, the, genus, western, north, america, has, several, species, closely, related, to, b, edulis, the, white, king, bolete, boletus, barrowsii, found, in, parts, of, colorado, new, mexico, arizona, and, california, and, possibly, elsewhere, is, named, after, its, discoverer, chuck, barrows, it, is, lighter, in, colour, than, b, edulis, having, a, cream, coloured, cap, with, pink, tones, often, mycorrhizal, with, ponderosa, pine, it, tends, to, grow, in, areas, where, there, is, less, rainfall, some, find, its, flavour, as, good, as, if, not, better, than, b, edulis, the, california, king, bolete, boletus, edulis, var, grandedulis, can, reach, massive, proportions, and, is, distinguished, from, b, edulis, by, a, mature, pore, surface, that, is, brown, to, slightly, reddish, the, cap, colour, appears, to, be, affected, by, the, amount, of, light, received, during, its, development, and, may, range, from, white, in, young, specimens, grown, under, thick, canopy, to, dark, brown, red, brown, or, yellow, brown, in, those, specimens, receiving, more, light, the, queen, bolete, boletus, regineus, formerly, considered, a, variety, of, b, aereus, is, also, a, choice, edible, it, is, generally, smaller, than, b, edulis, and, unlike, that, species, is, typically, found, in, mixed, forests, the, spring, king, bolete, boletus, rex, veris, formerly, considered, a, variety, of, b, edulis, or, b, pinophilus, is, found, throughout, western, north, america, in, contrast, to, b, edulis, b, rex, veris, tends, to, fruit, in, clusters, and, as, its, common, name, suggests, appears, in, the, spring, b, fibrillosus, is, edible, but, considered, inferior, in, taste, the, fruit, bodies, of, boletus, edulis, can, grow, singly, or, in, small, clusters, of, two, or, three, specimens, the, mushroom, s, habitat, consists, of, areas, dominated, by, pine, pinus, spp, spruce, picea, spp, hemlock, tsuga, spp, and, fir, abies, spp, trees, although, other, hosts, include, chestnut, chinquapin, beech, keteleeria, spp, lithocarpus, spp, and, oak, in, california, porcini, have, been, collected, in, a, variety, of, forests, such, as, coastal, forests, dry, interior, oak, forests, and, savannas, and, interior, high, elevation, montane, mixed, forests, to, an, altitude, of, 3, 500, m, 11, 500, ft, in, northwestern, spain, they, are, common, in, scrublands, dominated, by, the, rock, rose, species, cistus, ladanifer, and, halimium, lasianthum, in, the, midi, region, of, south, west, france, they, are, especially, favoured, and, locally, called, c, pe, de, bordeaux, after, the, town, from, which, they, are, traded, to, the, north, and, abroad, boletus, edulis, has, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, concentrated, in, cool, temperate, to, subtropical, regions, it, is, common, in, europe, from, northern, scandinavia, south, to, the, extremities, of, greece, and, italy, and, north, america, where, its, southern, range, extends, as, far, south, as, mexico, it, is, well, known, from, the, borgotaro, area, of, parma, italy, and, has, pgi, status, there, the, european, distribution, extends, north, to, scandinavia, and, south, to, southern, italy, and, morocco, in, the, american, pacific, northwest, it, can, be, found, from, may, to, october, in, china, the, mushroom, can, be, found, from, the, northeastern, heilongjiang, to, the, yunnan, guizhou, plateau, and, tibet, it, has, been, recorded, growing, under, pinus, and, tsuga, in, sagarmatha, national, park, in, nepal, as, well, as, in, the, indian, forests, of, arunachal, pradesh, in, west, asia, the, species, has, been, reported, from, the, northwest, forests, of, iran, some, steps, have, been, made, towards, cultivating, boletus, edulis, including, mycorrhization, of, rockrose, shrubs, enhanced, by, helper, bacteria, boletus, edulis, grows, in, some, areas, where, it, is, not, believed, to, be, indigenous, it, is, often, found, underneath, oak, and, silver, birch, in, hagley, park, in, central, christchurch, new, zealand, where, it, is, likely, to, have, been, introduced, probably, on, the, roots, of, container, grown, beech, birch, and, oak, in, the, mid, 19th, century, around, the, time, exotic, trees, began, to, be, planted, in, the, christchurch, area, similarly, it, has, been, collected, in, adelaide, hills, region, of, australia, in, association, with, three, species, of, introduced, trees, it, has, been, growing, plentifully, in, association, with, pine, forests, in, the, southern, kwazulu, natal, midlands, in, south, africa, for, more, than, 50, years, and, is, believed, to, have, been, introduced, with, the, import, of, pine, trees, it, also, grows, in, pine, plantations, in, neighboring, zimbabwe, italian, folklore, holds, that, porcini, sprout, up, at, the, time, of, the, new, moon, research, studies, have, tried, to, investigate, more, scientifically, the, factors, that, influence, the, production, of, fruit, bodies, although, fruit, bodies, may, appear, any, time, from, summer, to, autumn, june, to, november, in, the, uk, their, growth, is, known, to, be, triggered, by, rainfall, during, warm, periods, of, weather, followed, by, frequent, autumn, rain, with, a, drop, in, soil, temperature, above, average, rainfall, may, result, in, the, rapid, appearance, of, large, numbers, of, boletes, in, what, is, known, in, some, circles, as, a, bolete, year, a, 2004, field, study, indicated, that, fruit, body, production, is, enhanced, by, an, open, and, sunny, wood, habitat, corroborating, an, earlier, observation, made, in, a, zimbabwean, study, removal, of, the, litter, layer, on, the, forest, floor, appeared, to, have, a, negative, effect, on, fruit, body, production, but, previous, studies, reported, contradictory, results, a, lithuanian, study, conducted, in, 2001, concluded, that, the, maximal, daily, growth, rate, of, the, cap, about, 21, mm, or, 0, 8, in, occurred, when, the, relative, air, humidity, was, the, greatest, and, the, fruit, bodies, ceased, growing, when, the, air, humidity, dropped, below, 40, factors, most, likely, to, inhibit, the, appearance, of, fruit, bodies, included, prolonged, drought, inadequate, air, and, soil, humidity, sudden, decreases, of, night, air, temperatures, and, the, appearance, of, the, first, frost, plots, facing, north, tend, to, produce, more, mushrooms, compared, to, equivalent, plots, facing, south, boletus, edulis, is, mycorrhizal, it, is, in, a, mutualistic, relationship, with, the, roots, of, plants, hosts, in, which, the, fungus, exchanges, nitrogen, and, other, nutrients, extracted, from, the, environment, for, fixed, carbon, from, the, host, other, benefits, for, the, plant, are, evident, in, the, case, of, the, chinese, chestnut, the, formation, of, mycorrhizae, with, b, edulis, increases, the, ability, of, plant, seedlings, to, resist, water, stress, and, increases, leaf, succulence, leaf, area, and, water, holding, ability, the, fungus, forms, a, sheath, of, tissue, around, terminal, nutrient, absorbing, root, tips, often, inducing, a, high, degree, of, branching, in, the, tips, of, the, host, and, penetrating, into, the, root, tissue, forming, to, some, mycologists, the, defining, feature, of, ectomycorrhizal, relationships, a, hartig, net, the, ectomycorrhizal, fungi, are, then, able, to, exchange, nutrients, with, the, plant, effectively, expanding, the, root, system, of, the, host, plant, to, the, furthest, reaches, of, the, symbiont, fungi, compatible, hosts, may, belong, to, multiple, families, of, vascular, plants, that, are, widely, distributed, throughout, the, northern, hemisphere, according, to, one, 1995, estimate, there, are, at, least, 30, host, plant, species, distributed, over, more, than, 15, genera, examples, of, mycorrhizal, associates, include, chinese, red, pine, mexican, weeping, pine, scots, pine, norway, spruce, coast, douglas, fir, mountain, pine, and, virginia, pine, the, fungus, has, also, been, shown, to, associate, with, gum, rockrose, a, pioneer, early, stage, shrub, that, is, adapted, for, growth, in, degraded, areas, such, as, burned, forests, these, and, other, rockrose, species, are, ecologically, important, as, fungal, reservoirs, maintaining, an, inoculum, of, mycorrhizal, fungi, for, trees, that, appear, later, in, the, forest, regrowth, cycle, the, mushroom, has, been, noted, to, often, co, occur, with, amanita, muscaria, or, a, rubescens, although, it, is, unclear, whether, this, is, due, to, a, biological, association, between, the, species, or, because, of, similarities, in, growing, season, habitat, and, ecological, requirements, an, association, has, also, been, reported, between, b, edulis, and, amanita, excelsa, on, pinus, radiata, ectomycorrhizae, in, new, zealand, suggesting, that, other, fungi, may, influence, the, life, cycle, of, porcini, a, 2007, field, study, revealed, little, correlation, between, the, abundance, of, fruit, bodies, and, presence, of, its, mycelia, below, ground, even, when, soil, samples, were, taken, from, directly, beneath, the, mushroom, the, study, concluded, that, the, triggers, leading, to, formation, of, mycorrhizae, and, production, of, the, fruit, bodies, were, more, complex, boletus, edulis, is, known, to, be, able, to, tolerate, and, even, thrive, on, soil, that, is, contaminated, with, toxic, heavy, metals, such, as, soil, that, might, be, found, near, metal, smelters, the, mushroom, s, resistance, to, heavy, metal, toxicity, is, conferred, by, a, biochemical, called, a, phytochelatin, an, oligopeptide, whose, production, is, induced, after, exposure, to, metal, phytochelatins, are, chelating, agents, capable, of, forming, multiple, bonds, with, the, metal, in, this, state, the, metal, cannot, normally, react, with, other, elements, or, ions, and, is, stored, in, a, detoxified, form, in, the, mushroom, tissue, the, fruit, bodies, of, b, edulis, can, be, infected, by, the, parasitic, mould, like, fungus, hypomyces, chrysospermus, known, as, the, bolete, eater, which, manifests, itself, as, a, white, yellow, or, reddish, brown, cottony, layer, over, the, surface, of, the, mushroom, some, reported, cases, of, stomach, ache, following, consumption, of, dried, porcini, have, been, attributed, to, the, presence, of, this, mould, on, the, fruit, bodies, the, mushroom, is, also, used, as, a, food, source, by, several, species, of, mushroom, flies, as, well, as, other, insects, and, their, larvae, an, unidentified, species, of, virus, was, reported, to, have, infected, specimens, found, in, the, netherlands, and, in, italy, fruit, bodies, affected, by, the, virus, had, relatively, thick, stems, and, small, or, no, caps, leading, to, the, name, little, cap, disease, boletus, edulis, is, a, food, source, for, animals, such, as, the, banana, slug, ariolimax, columbianus, the, long, haired, grass, mouse, the, red, squirrel, and, as, noted, in, one, isolated, report, the, fox, sparrow, boletus, edulis, as, the, species, epithet, edulis, latin, edible, indicates, is, an, edible, mushroom, italian, chef, and, restaurateur, antonio, carluccio, has, described, it, as, representing, the, wild, mushroom, par, excellence, and, hails, it, as, the, most, rewarding, of, all, fungi, in, the, kitchen, for, its, taste, and, versatility, considered, a, choice, edible, particularly, in, france, germany, poland, and, italy, it, was, widely, written, about, by, the, roman, writers, pliny, the, elder, and, martial, although, ranked, below, the, esteemed, amanita, caesarea, when, he, was, served, suilli, instead, of, boleti, the, disgruntled, martial, wrote, sunt, tibi, boleti, fungos, ego, sumo, suillos, ep, iii, 60, you, eat, the, choice, boletus, i, have, mushrooms, that, swine, grub, up, the, flavour, of, porcini, has, been, described, as, nutty, and, slightly, meaty, with, a, smooth, creamy, texture, and, a, distinctive, aroma, reminiscent, of, sourdough, young, small, porcini, are, most, appreciated, as, the, large, ones, often, harbour, maggots, insect, larvae, and, become, slimy, soft, and, less, tasty, with, age, the, fruit, bodies, are, collected, by, holding, the, stipe, near, the, base, and, twisting, gently, cutting, the, stipe, with, a, knife, may, risk, the, part, left, behind, rotting, and, the, mycelium, being, destroyed, peeling, and, washing, are, not, recommended, the, fruit, bodies, are, highly, perishable, due, largely, to, the, high, water, content, around, 90, the, high, level, of, enzyme, activity, and, the, presence, of, a, flora, of, microorganisms, caution, should, be, exercised, when, collecting, specimens, from, potentially, polluted, or, contaminated, sites, as, several, studies, have, shown, that, the, fruit, bodies, can, bioaccumulate, toxic, heavy, metals, like, mercury, cadmium, caesium, and, polonium, bioaccumulated, metals, or, radioactive, fission, decay, products, are, like, chemical, signatures, chemical, and, radiochemical, analysis, can, be, used, to, identify, the, origin, of, imported, specimens, and, for, long, term, radioecological, monitoring, of, polluted, areas, porcini, are, sold, fresh, in, markets, in, summer, and, autumn, in, europe, and, russia, and, dried, or, canned, at, other, times, of, the, year, and, distributed, worldwide, to, countries, where, they, are, not, otherwise, found, they, are, eaten, and, enjoyed, raw, saut, ed, with, butter, ground, into, pasta, in, soups, and, in, many, other, dishes, in, france, they, are, used, in, recipes, such, as, c, pes, la, bordelaise, c, pe, frits, and, c, pe, aux, tomates, porcini, risotto, is, a, traditional, italian, autumn, dish, porcini, are, a, feature, of, many, cuisines, including, proven, al, and, viennese, in, thailand, they, are, used, in, soups, and, consumed, blanched, in, salads, porcini, can, also, be, frozen, either, while, raw, or, after, cooking, in, butter, the, colour, aroma, and, taste, of, porcini, deteriorate, noticeably, after, being, frozen, for, four, months, blanching, or, soaking, and, blanching, as, a, processing, step, before, freezing, can, extend, the, freezer, life, to, 12, months, they, are, also, one, of, the, few, species, sold, commercially, as, pickled, mushrooms, boletus, edulis, is, well, suited, to, drying, its, flavour, intensifies, it, is, easily, reconstituted, and, its, resulting, texture, is, pleasant, reconstitution, is, done, by, soaking, in, hot, but, not, boiling, water, for, about, twenty, minutes, the, water, used, is, infused, with, the, mushroom, aroma, and, it, too, can, be, used, in, subsequent, cooking, dried, porcini, have, more, protein, than, most, other, commonly, consumed, vegetables, apart, from, soybeans, some, of, their, protein, is, indigestible, though, digestibility, is, improved, with, cooking, like, other, boletes, porcini, can, be, dried, by, being, strung, separately, on, twine, and, hung, close, to, the, ceiling, of, a, kitchen, alternatively, the, mushrooms, can, be, dried, by, cleaning, with, a, brush, washing, is, not, recommended, and, then, placing, them, in, a, wicker, basket, or, bamboo, steamer, on, top, of, a, boiler, or, hot, water, tank, another, method, is, drying, in, an, oven, at, 25, to, 30, c, 77, to, 86, f, for, two, to, three, hours, then, increasing, the, temperature, to, 50, c, 122, f, until, crisp, or, brittle, once, dry, they, must, be, kept, in, an, airtight, container, importantly, for, commercial, production, porcini, retain, their, flavour, after, industrial, preparation, in, a, pressure, cooker, or, after, canning, or, bottling, and, are, thus, useful, for, manufacturers, of, soups, or, stews, the, addition, of, a, few, pieces, of, dried, porcino, can, significantly, add, to, flavour, and, they, are, a, major, ingredient, of, the, pasta, sauce, known, as, carrettiera, carter, s, sauce, the, drying, process, is, known, to, induce, the, formation, of, various, volatile, substances, that, contribute, to, the, mushroom, s, aroma, chemical, analysis, has, shown, that, the, odour, of, the, dried, mushroom, is, a, complex, mixture, of, 53, volatile, compounds, a, 1998, estimate, suggested, that, the, total, annual, worldwide, consumption, of, boletus, edulis, and, closely, related, species, b, aereus, b, pinophilus, and, b, reticulatus, was, between, 20, 000, and, 100, 000, tons, approximately, 2, 700, tonnes, 3, 000, tons, were, sold, in, france, italy, and, germany, in, 1988, according, to, official, figures, the, true, amount, consumed, far, exceeds, this, as, the, official, sales, figures, did, not, account, for, informal, sales, or, consumption, by, collectors, they, are, widely, exported, and, sold, in, dried, form, reaching, countries, where, they, do, not, occur, naturally, such, as, australia, and, new, zealand, the, autonomous, community, of, castile, and, le, n, in, spain, produces, 7, 700, tonnes, 8, 500, tons, annually, in, autumn, the, price, of, porcini, in, the, northern, hemisphere, typically, ranges, between, 20, and, 80, per, kilogram, although, in, new, york, in, 1997, the, wholesale, price, rose, to, more, than, 200, per, kilogram, due, to, scarcity, in, the, vicinity, of, borgotaro, in, the, province, of, parma, of, northern, italy, the, four, species, boletus, edulis, b, aereus, b, aestivalis, and, b, pinophilus, have, been, recognised, for, their, superior, taste, and, officially, termed, fungo, di, borgotaro, here, these, mushrooms, have, been, collected, for, centuries, and, exported, commercially, owing, to, the, globalisation, of, the, mushroom, trade, most, of, the, porcini, commercially, available, in, italy, or, exported, by, italy, no, longer, originate, there, porcini, and, other, mushrooms, are, also, imported, into, italy, from, various, locations, especially, china, and, eastern, european, countries, these, are, then, often, re, exported, under, the, italian, porcini, label, in, italy, the, disconnect, with, local, production, has, had, an, adverse, effect, on, quality, for, example, in, the, 1990s, some, of, the, dried, porcino, mushrooms, exported, to, italy, from, china, contained, species, of, genus, tylopilus, which, are, rather, similar, in, appearance, and, when, dried, are, difficult, for, both, mushroom, labourers, and, mycologists, alike, to, distinguish, from, boletus, tylopilus, species, typically, have, a, very, bitter, taste, which, is, imparted, to, the, flavour, of, the, porcini, with, which, they, are, mixed, after, the, fall, of, the, iron, curtain, and, the, subsequent, reduction, of, economic, and, political, barriers, central, and, eastern, european, countries, with, local, mushroom, harvesting, traditions, such, as, albania, bulgaria, macedonia, romania, serbia, and, slovenia, developed, into, exporters, of, porcini, concentrating, primarily, on, the, italian, market, porcini, and, other, wild, fungi, from, these, countries, are, also, destined, for, france, germany, and, other, western, european, markets, where, demand, for, them, exists, but, collection, on, a, commercial, scale, does, not, picking, b, edulis, has, become, an, annual, seasonal, income, earner, and, pastime, in, countries, like, bulgaria, especially, for, many, roma, communities, and, the, unemployed, a, lack, of, control, of, the, harvest, has, led, to, heavy, exploitation, of, the, mushroom, resource, like, many, other, strictly, mycorrhizal, fungi, b, edulis, has, eluded, cultivation, attempts, for, years, the, results, of, some, studies, suggest, that, unknown, components, of, the, soil, microflora, might, be, required, for, b, edulis, to, establish, a, mycorrhizal, relationship, with, the, host, plant, successful, attempts, at, cultivating, b, edulis, have, been, made, by, spanish, scientists, by, mycorrhization, of, cistus, species, with, pseudomonas, fluorescens, bacteria, helping, the, mycorrhiza, boletus, edulis, mushrooms, are, 9, carbohydrates, 3, fat, and, 7, protein, table, fresh, mushrooms, consist, of, over, 80, moisture, although, reported, values, tend, to, differ, somewhat, as, moisture, content, can, be, affected, by, environmental, temperature, and, relative, humidity, during, growth, and, storage, the, carbohydrate, component, contains, the, monosaccharides, glucose, mannitol, and, trehalose, the, polysaccharide, glycogen, and, the, water, insoluble, structural, polysaccharide, chitin, which, accounts, for, up, to, 80, 90, of, dry, matter, in, mushroom,
