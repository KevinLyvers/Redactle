lung, cancer, also, known, as, lung, carcinoma, is, a, malignant, tumor, that, begins, in, the, lung, lung, cancer, is, caused, by, genetic, damage, to, the, dna, of, cells, in, the, airways, often, caused, by, cigarette, smoking, or, inhaling, damaging, chemicals, damaged, airway, cells, gain, the, ability, to, multiply, unchecked, causing, the, growth, of, a, tumor, without, treatment, tumors, spread, throughout, the, lung, damaging, lung, function, eventually, lung, tumors, metastasize, spreading, to, other, parts, of, the, body, early, lung, cancer, often, has, no, symptoms, and, can, only, be, detected, by, medical, imaging, as, the, cancer, progresses, most, people, experience, nonspecific, respiratory, problems, coughing, shortness, of, breath, or, chest, pain, other, symptoms, depend, on, the, location, and, size, of, the, tumor, those, suspected, of, having, lung, cancer, typically, undergo, a, series, of, imaging, tests, to, determine, the, location, and, extent, of, any, tumors, definitive, diagnosis, of, lung, cancer, requires, a, biopsy, of, the, suspected, tumor, be, examined, by, a, pathologist, under, a, microscope, in, addition, to, recognizing, cancerous, cells, a, pathologist, can, classify, the, tumor, according, to, the, type, of, cells, it, originates, from, around, 15, of, cases, are, small, cell, lung, cancer, sclc, and, the, remaining, 85, the, non, small, cell, lung, cancers, or, nsclc, are, adenocarcinomas, squamous, cell, carcinomas, and, large, cell, carcinomas, after, diagnosis, further, imaging, and, biopsies, are, done, to, determine, the, cancer, s, stage, based, on, how, far, it, has, spread, treatment, for, early, stage, lung, cancer, includes, surgery, to, remove, the, tumor, sometimes, followed, by, radiation, therapy, and, chemotherapy, to, kill, any, remaining, cancer, cells, later, stage, cancer, is, treated, with, radiation, therapy, and, chemotherapy, alongside, drug, treatments, that, target, specific, cancer, subtypes, even, with, treatment, only, around, 20, of, people, survive, five, years, on, from, their, diagnosis, survival, rates, are, higher, in, those, diagnosed, at, an, earlier, stage, diagnosed, at, a, younger, age, and, in, women, compared, to, men, most, lung, cancer, cases, are, caused, by, tobacco, smoking, the, remainder, are, caused, by, exposure, to, hazardous, substances, like, asbestos, and, radon, gas, or, by, genetic, mutations, that, arise, by, chance, consequently, lung, cancer, prevention, efforts, encourage, people, to, avoid, hazardous, chemicals, and, quit, smoking, quitting, smoking, both, reduces, one, s, chance, of, developing, lung, cancer, and, improves, treatment, outcomes, in, those, already, diagnosed, with, lung, cancer, lung, cancer, is, the, most, diagnosed, and, deadliest, cancer, worldwide, with, 2, 2, million, cases, in, 2020, resulting, in, 1, 8, million, deaths, lung, cancer, is, rare, in, those, younger, than, 40, the, average, age, at, diagnosis, is, 70, years, and, the, average, age, at, death, 72, incidence, and, outcomes, vary, widely, across, the, world, depending, on, patterns, of, tobacco, use, prior, to, the, advent, of, cigarette, smoking, in, the, 20th, century, lung, cancer, was, a, rare, disease, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, increasing, evidence, linked, lung, cancer, and, tobacco, use, culminating, in, declarations, by, most, large, national, health, bodies, discouraging, tobacco, use, early, lung, cancer, often, has, no, symptoms, when, symptoms, do, arise, they, are, often, nonspecific, respiratory, problems, coughing, shortness, of, breath, or, chest, pain, that, can, differ, from, person, to, person, those, who, experience, coughing, tend, to, report, either, a, new, cough, or, an, increase, in, the, frequency, or, strength, of, a, pre, existing, cough, around, one, in, four, cough, up, blood, ranging, from, small, streaks, in, the, sputum, to, large, amounts, around, half, of, those, diagnosed, with, lung, cancer, experience, shortness, of, breath, while, 25, 50, experience, a, dull, persistent, chest, pain, that, remains, in, the, same, location, over, time, in, addition, to, respiratory, symptoms, some, experience, systemic, symptoms, including, loss, of, appetite, weight, loss, general, weakness, fever, and, night, sweats, some, less, common, symptoms, suggest, tumors, in, particular, locations, tumors, in, the, thorax, can, cause, breathing, problems, by, obstructing, the, trachea, or, disrupting, the, nerve, to, the, diaphragm, difficulty, swallowing, by, compressing, the, esophagus, hoarseness, by, disrupting, the, nerves, of, the, larynx, and, horner, s, syndrome, by, disrupting, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, horner, s, syndrome, is, also, common, in, tumors, at, the, top, of, the, lung, known, as, pancoast, tumors, which, also, cause, shoulder, pain, that, radiates, down, the, little, finger, side, of, the, arm, as, well, as, destruction, of, the, topmost, ribs, swollen, lymph, nodes, above, the, collarbone, can, indicate, a, tumor, that, has, spread, within, the, chest, tumors, obstructing, bloodflow, to, the, heart, can, cause, superior, vena, cava, syndrome, swelling, of, the, upper, body, and, shortness, of, breath, while, tumors, infiltrating, the, area, around, the, heart, can, cause, fluid, buildup, around, the, heart, arrythmia, irregular, heartbeat, and, heart, failure, about, one, in, three, people, diagnosed, with, lung, cancer, have, symptoms, caused, by, metastases, in, sites, other, than, the, lungs, lung, cancer, can, metastasize, anywhere, in, the, body, with, different, symptoms, depending, on, the, location, brain, metastases, can, cause, headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and, neurological, deficits, bone, metastases, can, cause, pain, bone, fractures, and, compression, of, the, spinal, cord, metastasis, into, the, bone, marrow, can, deplete, blood, cells, and, cause, leukoerythroblastosis, immature, cells, in, the, blood, liver, metastases, can, cause, liver, enlargement, pain, in, the, right, upper, quadrant, of, the, abdomen, fever, and, weight, loss, lung, tumors, often, cause, the, release, of, body, altering, hormones, which, cause, unusual, symptoms, called, paraneoplastic, syndromes, inappropriate, hormone, release, can, cause, dramatic, shifts, in, concentrations, of, blood, minerals, most, common, is, hypercalcemia, high, blood, calcium, caused, by, over, production, of, parathyroid, hormone, related, protein, or, parathyroid, hormone, hypercalcemia, can, manifest, as, nausea, vomiting, abdominal, pain, constipation, increased, thirst, frequent, urination, and, altered, mental, status, those, with, lung, cancer, also, commonly, experience, hypokalemia, low, potassium, due, to, inappropriate, secretion, of, adrenocorticotropic, hormone, as, well, as, hyponatremia, low, sodium, due, to, overproduction, of, antidiuretic, hormone, or, atrial, natriuretic, peptide, about, one, of, three, people, with, lung, cancer, develop, nail, clubbing, while, up, to, one, in, ten, experience, hypertrophic, pulmonary, osteoarthropathy, nail, clubbing, joint, soreness, and, skin, thickening, a, variety, of, autoimmune, disorders, can, arise, as, paraneoplastic, syndromes, in, those, with, lung, cancer, including, lambert, eaton, myasthenic, syndrome, which, causes, muscle, weakness, sensory, neuropathies, muscle, inflammation, brain, swelling, and, autoimmune, deterioration, of, cerebellum, limbic, system, or, brainstem, up, to, one, in, twelve, people, with, lung, cancer, have, paraneoplastic, blood, clotting, including, migratory, venous, thrombophlebitis, clots, in, the, heart, and, disseminated, intravascular, coagulation, clots, throughout, the, body, paraneoplastic, syndromes, involving, the, skin, and, kidneys, are, rare, each, occurring, in, up, to, 1, of, those, with, lung, cancer, a, person, suspected, of, having, lung, cancer, will, have, imaging, tests, done, to, evaluate, the, presence, extent, and, location, of, tumors, first, many, primary, care, providers, perform, a, chest, x, ray, to, look, for, a, mass, inside, the, lung, the, x, ray, may, reveal, an, obvious, mass, the, widening, of, the, mediastinum, suggestive, of, spread, to, lymph, nodes, there, atelectasis, lung, collapse, consolidation, pneumonia, or, pleural, effusion, however, some, lung, tumors, are, not, visible, by, x, ray, next, many, undergo, computed, tomography, ct, scanning, which, can, reveal, the, sizes, and, locations, of, tumors, a, definitive, diagnosis, of, lung, cancer, requires, a, biopsy, of, the, suspected, tissue, be, histologically, examined, for, cancer, cells, given, the, location, of, lung, cancer, tumors, biopsies, can, often, be, obtained, by, minimally, invasive, techniques, a, fiberoptic, bronchoscope, that, can, retrieve, tissue, sometimes, guided, by, endobronchial, ultrasound, fine, needle, aspiration, or, other, imaging, guided, biopsy, through, the, skin, those, who, cannot, undergo, a, typical, biopsy, procedure, may, instead, have, a, liquid, biopsy, taken, that, is, a, sample, of, some, body, fluid, which, may, contain, circulating, tumor, dna, that, can, be, detected, imaging, is, also, used, to, assess, the, extent, of, cancer, spread, positron, emission, tomography, pet, scanning, or, combined, pet, ct, scanning, is, often, used, to, locate, metastases, in, the, body, since, pet, scanning, is, less, sensitive, in, the, brain, the, national, comprehensive, cancer, network, recommends, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, or, ct, where, mri, is, unavailable, to, scan, the, brain, for, metastases, in, those, with, nsclc, and, large, tumors, or, tumors, that, have, spread, to, the, nearby, lymph, nodes, when, imaging, suggests, the, tumor, has, spread, the, suspected, metastasis, is, often, biopsied, to, confirm, that, it, is, cancerous, lung, cancer, most, commonly, metastasizes, to, the, brain, bones, liver, and, adrenal, glands, lung, cancer, can, often, appear, as, a, solitary, pulmonary, nodule, on, a, chest, radiograph, or, ct, scan, in, lung, cancer, screening, studies, as, many, as, 30, of, those, screened, have, a, lung, nodule, the, majority, of, which, turn, out, to, be, benign, besides, lung, cancer, many, other, diseases, can, also, give, this, appearance, including, hamartomas, and, infectious, granulomas, caused, by, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or, coccidioidomycosis, at, diagnosis, lung, cancer, is, classified, based, on, the, type, of, cells, the, tumor, is, derived, from, tumors, derived, from, different, cells, progress, and, respond, to, treatment, differently, there, are, two, main, types, of, lung, cancer, categorized, by, the, size, and, appearance, of, the, malignant, cells, seen, by, a, histopathologist, under, a, microscope, small, cell, lung, cancer, sclc, 15, of, cases, and, non, small, cell, lung, cancer, nsclc, 85, of, cases, sclc, tumors, are, often, found, near, the, center, of, the, lungs, in, the, major, airways, their, cells, appear, small, with, ill, defined, boundaries, not, much, cytoplasm, many, mitochondria, and, have, distinctive, nuclei, with, granular, looking, chromatin, and, no, visible, nucleoli, nsclcs, comprise, a, group, of, three, cancer, types, adenocarcinoma, squamous, cell, carcinoma, and, large, cell, carcinoma, nearly, 40, of, lung, cancers, are, adenocarcinomas, their, cells, grow, in, three, dimensional, clumps, resemble, glandular, cells, and, may, produce, mucin, about, 30, of, lung, cancers, are, squamous, cell, carcinomas, they, typically, occur, close, to, large, airways, the, tumors, consist, of, sheets, of, cells, with, layers, of, keratin, a, hollow, cavity, and, associated, cell, death, are, commonly, found, at, the, center, of, the, tumor, less, than, 10, of, lung, cancers, are, large, cell, carcinomas, so, named, because, the, cells, are, large, with, excess, cytoplasm, large, nuclei, and, conspicuous, nucleoli, around, 10, of, lung, cancers, are, rarer, types, these, include, mixes, of, the, above, subtypes, like, adenosquamous, carcinoma, and, rare, subtypes, such, as, carcinoid, tumors, and, sarcomatoid, carcinomas, several, lung, cancer, types, are, subclassified, based, on, the, growth, characteristics, of, the, cancer, cells, adenocarcinomas, are, classified, as, lepidic, growing, along, the, surface, of, intact, alveolar, walls, acinar, and, papillary, or, micropapillary, and, solid, pattern, lepidic, adenocarcinomas, tend, to, be, least, aggressive, while, micropapillary, and, solid, pattern, adenocarcinomas, are, most, aggressive, in, addition, to, examining, cell, morphology, biopsies, are, often, stained, by, immunohistochemistry, to, confirm, lung, cancer, classification, sclcs, bear, the, markers, of, neuroendocrine, cells, such, as, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and, cd56, adenocarcinomas, tend, to, express, napsin, a, and, ttf, 1, squamous, cell, carcinomas, lack, napsin, a, and, ttf, 1, but, express, p63, and, its, cancer, specific, isoform, p40, ck7, and, ck20, are, also, commonly, used, to, differentiate, lung, cancers, ck20, is, found, in, several, cancers, but, typically, absent, from, lung, cancer, ck7, is, present, in, many, lung, cancers, but, absent, from, squamous, cell, carcinomas, lung, cancer, staging, is, an, assessment, of, the, degree, of, spread, of, the, cancer, from, its, original, source, it, is, one, of, the, factors, affecting, both, the, prognosis, and, the, treatment, of, lung, cancer, sclc, is, typically, staged, with, a, relatively, simple, system, limited, stage, or, extensive, stage, around, a, third, of, people, are, diagnosed, at, the, limited, stage, meaning, cancer, is, confined, to, one, side, of, the, chest, within, the, scope, of, a, single, radiotherapy, field, the, other, two, thirds, are, diagnosed, at, the, extensive, stage, with, cancer, spread, to, both, sides, of, the, chest, or, to, other, parts, of, the, body, nsclc, and, sometimes, sclc, is, typically, staged, with, the, american, joint, committee, on, cancer, s, tumor, node, metastasis, tnm, staging, system, the, size, and, extent, of, the, tumor, t, spread, to, regional, lymph, nodes, n, and, distant, metastases, m, are, scored, individually, and, combined, to, form, stage, groups, relatively, small, tumors, are, designated, t1, which, are, subdivided, by, size, tumors, 1, centimeter, cm, across, are, t1a, 1, 2, cm, t1b, 2, 3, cm, t1c, tumors, up, to, 5, cm, across, or, those, that, have, spread, to, the, visceral, pleura, tissue, covering, the, lung, or, main, bronchi, are, designated, t2, t2a, designates, 3, 4, cm, tumors, t2b, 4, 5, cm, tumors, t3, tumors, are, up, to, 7, cm, across, have, multiple, nodules, in, the, same, lobe, of, the, lung, or, invade, the, chest, wall, diaphragm, or, the, nerve, that, controls, it, or, area, around, the, heart, tumors, that, are, larger, than, 7, cm, have, nodules, spread, in, different, lobes, of, a, lung, or, invade, the, mediastinum, center, of, the, chest, cavity, heart, largest, blood, vessels, that, supply, the, heart, trachea, esophagus, or, spine, are, designated, t4, lymph, node, staging, depends, on, the, extent, of, local, spread, with, the, cancer, metastasized, to, no, lymph, nodes, n0, pulmonary, or, hilar, nodes, along, the, bronchi, on, the, same, side, as, the, tumor, n1, mediastinal, or, subcarinal, lymph, nodes, in, the, middle, of, the, lungs, n2, or, lymph, nodes, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, lung, from, the, tumor, n3, metastases, are, staged, as, no, metastases, m0, nearby, metastases, m1a, the, space, around, the, lung, or, the, heart, or, the, opposite, lung, a, single, distant, metastasis, m1b, or, multiple, metastases, m1c, these, t, n, and, m, scores, are, combined, to, designate, a, stage, grouping, for, the, cancer, cancer, limited, to, smaller, tumors, is, designated, stage, i, disease, with, larger, tumors, or, spread, to, the, nearest, lymph, nodes, is, stage, ii, cancer, with, the, largest, tumors, or, extensive, lymph, node, spread, is, stage, iii, cancer, that, has, metastasized, is, stage, iv, each, stage, is, further, subdivided, based, on, the, combination, of, t, n, and, m, scores, some, countries, recommend, that, people, who, are, at, a, high, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, be, screened, at, different, intervals, using, low, dose, ct, lung, scans, screening, programs, may, result, in, early, detection, of, lung, tumors, in, people, who, are, not, yet, experiencing, symptoms, of, lung, cancer, ideally, early, enough, that, the, tumors, can, be, successfully, treated, and, result, in, decreased, mortality, there, is, evidence, that, regular, low, dose, ct, scans, in, people, at, high, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, reduces, total, lung, cancer, deaths, by, as, much, as, 20, despite, evidence, of, benefit, in, these, populations, potential, harms, of, screening, include, the, potential, for, a, person, to, have, a, false, positive, screening, result, that, may, lead, to, unnecessary, testing, invasive, procedures, and, distress, although, rare, there, is, also, a, risk, of, radiation, induced, cancer, the, united, states, preventive, services, task, force, recommends, yearly, screening, using, low, dose, ct, in, people, between, 55, and, 80, who, have, a, smoking, history, of, at, least, 30, pack, years, the, european, commission, recommends, that, cancer, screening, programs, across, the, european, union, be, extended, to, include, low, dose, ct, lung, scans, for, current, or, previous, smokers, similarly, the, canadian, task, force, for, preventative, health, recommends, that, people, who, are, current, or, former, smokers, smoking, history, of, more, than, 30, pack, years, and, who, are, between, the, ages, of, 55, 74, years, be, screened, for, lung, cancer, treatment, for, lung, cancer, depends, on, the, cancer, s, specific, cell, type, how, far, it, has, spread, and, the, person, s, health, common, treatments, for, early, stage, cancer, includes, surgical, removal, of, the, tumor, chemotherapy, and, radiation, therapy, for, later, stage, cancer, chemotherapy, and, radiation, therapy, are, combined, with, newer, targeted, molecular, therapies, and, immune, checkpoint, inhibitors, all, lung, cancer, treatment, regimens, are, combined, with, lifestyle, changes, and, palliative, care, to, improve, quality, of, life, limited, stage, sclc, is, typically, treated, with, a, combination, of, chemotherapy, and, radiotherapy, for, chemotherapy, the, national, comprehensive, cancer, network, and, american, college, of, chest, physicians, guidelines, recommend, four, to, six, cycles, of, a, platinum, based, chemotherapeutic, cisplatin, or, carboplatin, combined, with, either, etoposide, or, irinotecan, this, is, typically, combined, with, thoracic, radiation, therapy, 45, gray, gy, twice, daily, alongside, the, first, two, chemotherapy, cycles, first, line, therapy, causes, remission, in, up, to, 80, of, those, who, receive, it, however, most, people, relapse, with, chemotherapy, resistant, disease, those, who, relapse, are, given, second, line, chemotherapies, topotecan, and, lurbinectedin, are, approved, by, the, us, fda, for, this, purpose, irinotecan, paclitaxel, docetaxel, vinorelbine, etoposide, and, gemcitabine, are, also, sometimes, used, and, are, similarly, efficacious, prophylactic, cranial, irradiation, can, reduce, the, risk, of, brain, metastases, and, improve, survival, in, those, with, limited, stage, disease, extensive, stage, sclc, is, treated, first, with, etoposide, along, with, either, cisplatin, or, carboplatin, radiotherapy, is, used, only, to, shrink, tumors, that, are, causing, particularly, severe, symptoms, combining, standard, chemotherapy, with, an, immune, checkpoint, inhibitor, can, improve, survival, for, a, minority, of, those, affected, extending, the, average, person, s, lifespan, by, around, 2, months, for, stage, i, and, stage, ii, nsclc, the, first, line, of, treatment, is, often, surgical, removal, of, the, affected, lobe, of, the, lung, for, those, not, well, enough, to, tolerate, full, lobe, removal, a, smaller, chunk, of, lung, tissue, can, be, removed, by, wedge, resection, or, segmentectomy, surgery, those, with, centrally, located, tumors, and, otherwise, healthy, respiratory, systems, may, have, more, extreme, surgery, to, remove, an, entire, lung, pneumonectomy, experienced, thoracic, surgeons, and, a, high, volume, surgery, clinic, improve, chances, of, survival, those, who, are, unable, or, unwilling, to, undergo, surgery, can, instead, receive, radiation, therapy, stereotactic, body, radiation, therapy, is, best, practice, typically, administered, several, times, over, 1, 2, weeks, chemotherapy, has, little, effect, in, those, with, stage, i, nsclc, and, may, worsen, disease, outcomes, in, those, with, the, earliest, disease, in, those, with, stage, ii, disease, chemotherapy, is, usually, initiated, six, to, twelve, weeks, after, surgery, with, up, to, four, cycles, of, cisplatin, or, carboplatin, in, those, with, kidney, problems, neuropathy, or, hearing, impairment, combined, with, vinorelbine, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, or, docetaxel, treatment, for, those, with, stage, iii, nsclc, depends, on, the, nature, of, their, disease, those, with, more, limited, spread, may, undergo, surgery, to, have, the, tumor, and, affected, lymph, nodes, removed, followed, by, chemotherapy, and, potentially, radiotherapy, those, with, particularly, large, tumors, t4, and, those, for, whom, surgery, is, impractical, are, treated, with, combination, chemotherapy, and, radiotherapy, along, with, the, immunotherapy, durvalumab, combined, chemotherapy, and, radiation, enhances, survival, compared, to, chemotherapy, followed, by, radiation, though, the, combination, therapy, comes, with, harsher, side, effects, those, with, stage, iv, disease, are, treated, with, combinations, of, pain, medication, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and, chemotherapy, many, cases, of, advanced, disease, can, be, treated, with, targeted, therapies, depending, on, the, genetic, makeup, of, the, cancerous, cells, up, to, 30, of, tumors, have, mutations, in, the, egfr, gene, that, result, in, an, overactive, egfr, protein, these, can, be, treated, with, egfr, inhibitors, osimertinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, or, dacomitinib, with, osimertinib, known, to, be, superior, to, erlotinib, and, gefitinib, and, all, superior, to, chemotherapy, alone, up, to, 7, of, those, with, nsclc, harbor, mutations, that, result, in, hyperactive, alk, protein, which, can, be, treated, with, alk, inhibitors, crizotinib, or, its, successors, alectinib, brigatinib, and, ceritinib, those, treated, with, alk, inhibitors, who, relapse, can, then, be, treated, with, the, third, generation, alk, inhibitor, lorlatinib, up, to, 5, with, nsclc, have, overactive, met, which, can, be, inhibited, with, met, inhibitors, capmatinib, or, tepotinib, targeted, therapies, are, also, available, for, some, cancers, with, rare, mutations, cancers, with, hyperactive, braf, around, 2, of, nsclc, can, be, treated, by, dabrafenib, combined, with, the, mek, inhibitor, trametinib, those, with, activated, ros1, around, 1, of, nsclc, can, be, inhibited, by, crizotinib, lorlatinib, or, entrectinib, overactive, ntrk, 1, of, nsclc, by, entrectinib, or, larotrectinib, active, ret, around, 1, of, nsclc, by, selpercatinib, people, whose, nsclc, is, not, targetable, by, current, molecular, therapies, instead, can, be, treated, with, combination, chemotherapy, plus, immune, checkpoint, inhibitors, which, prevent, cancer, cells, from, inactivating, immune, t, cells, the, chemotherapeutic, agent, of, choice, depends, on, the, nsclc, subtype, cisplatin, plus, gemcitabine, for, squamous, cell, carcinoma, cisplatin, plus, pemetrexed, for, non, squamous, cell, carcinoma, immune, checkpoint, inhibitors, are, most, effective, against, tumors, that, express, the, protein, pd, l1, but, are, sometimes, effective, in, those, that, do, not, treatment, with, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or, combination, nivolumab, plus, ipilimumab, are, all, superior, to, chemotherapy, alone, against, tumors, expressing, pd, l1, those, who, relapse, on, the, above, are, treated, with, second, line, chemotherapeutics, docetaxel, and, ramucirumab, integrating, palliative, care, medical, care, focused, on, improving, symptoms, and, lessening, discomfort, into, lung, cancer, treatment, from, the, time, of, diagnosis, improves, the, survival, time, and, quality, of, life, of, those, with, lung, cancer, particularly, common, symptoms, of, lung, cancer, are, shortness, of, breath, and, pain, supplemental, oxygen, improved, airflow, re, orienting, an, affected, person, in, bed, and, low, dose, morphine, can, all, improve, shortness, of, breath, in, around, 20, to, 30, of, those, with, lung, cancer, particularly, those, with, late, stage, disease, growth, of, the, tumor, can, narrow, or, block, the, airway, causing, coughing, and, difficulty, breathing, obstructing, tumors, can, be, surgically, removed, where, possible, though, typically, those, with, airway, obstruction, are, not, well, enough, for, surgery, in, such, cases, the, american, college, of, chest, physicians, recommends, opening, the, airway, by, inserting, a, stent, attempting, to, shrink, the, tumor, with, localized, radiation, brachytherapy, or, physically, removing, the, blocking, tissue, by, bronchoscopy, sometimes, aided, by, thermal, or, laser, ablation, other, causes, of, lung, cancer, associated, shortness, of, breath, can, be, treated, directly, such, as, antibiotics, for, a, lung, infection, diuretics, for, pulmonary, edema, benzodiazepines, for, anxiety, and, steroids, for, airway, obstruction, up, to, 92, of, those, with, lung, cancer, report, pain, either, from, tissue, damage, at, the, tumor, site, s, or, nerve, damage, the, world, health, organization, who, has, developed, a, three, tiered, system, for, managing, cancer, pain, for, those, with, mild, pain, tier, one, the, who, recommends, acetominophen, or, a, nonsteroidal, anti, inflammatory, drug, around, a, third, of, people, experience, moderate, tier, two, or, severe, tier, three, pain, for, which, the, who, recommends, opioid, painkillers, opioids, are, typically, effective, at, easing, nociceptive, pain, pain, caused, by, damage, to, various, body, tissues, opioids, are, occasionally, effective, at, easing, neuropathic, pain, pain, caused, by, nerve, damage, neuropathic, agents, such, as, anticonvulsants, tricyclic, antidepressants, and, serotonin, norepinephrine, reuptake, inhibitors, are, often, used, to, ease, neuropathic, pain, either, alone, or, in, combination, with, opioids, in, many, cases, targeted, radiotherapy, can, be, used, to, shrink, tumors, reducing, pain, and, other, symptoms, caused, by, tumor, growth, individuals, who, have, advanced, disease, and, are, approaching, end, of, life, can, benefit, from, dedicated, end, of, life, care, to, manage, symptoms, and, ease, suffering, as, in, earlier, disease, pain, and, difficulty, breathing, are, common, and, can, be, managed, with, opioid, pain, medications, transitioning, from, oral, medication, to, injected, medication, if, the, affected, individual, loses, the, ability, to, swallow, coughing, is, also, common, and, can, be, managed, with, opioids, or, cough, suppressants, some, experience, terminal, delirium, confused, behavior, unexplained, movements, or, a, reversal, of, the, sleep, wake, cycle, which, can, be, managed, by, antipsychotic, drugs, low, dose, sedatives, and, investigating, other, causes, of, discomfort, such, as, low, blood, sugar, constipation, and, sepsis, in, the, last, few, days, of, life, many, develop, terminal, secretions, pooled, fluid, in, the, airways, that, can, cause, a, rattling, sound, while, breathing, this, is, thought, not, to, cause, respiratory, problems, but, can, distress, family, members, and, caregivers, terminal, secretions, can, be, reduced, by, anticholinergic, medications, even, those, who, are, non, communicative, or, have, reduced, consciousness, may, be, able, to, experience, cancer, related, pain, so, pain, medications, are, typically, continued, until, the, time, of, death, around, 19, of, people, diagnosed, with, lung, cancer, survive, five, years, from, diagnosis, though, prognosis, varies, based, on, the, stage, of, the, disease, at, diagnosis, and, the, type, of, lung, cancer, prognosis, is, better, for, people, with, lung, cancer, diagnosed, at, an, earlier, stage, those, diagnosed, at, the, earliest, tnm, stage, ia1, small, tumor, no, spread, have, a, two, year, survival, of, 97, and, five, year, survival, of, 92, those, diagnosed, at, the, most, advanced, stage, ivb, have, a, two, year, survival, of, 10, and, a, five, year, survival, of, 0, five, year, survival, is, higher, in, women, 22, than, men, 16, women, tend, to, be, diagnosed, with, less, advanced, disease, and, have, better, outcomes, than, men, diagnosed, at, the, same, stage, average, five, year, survival, also, varies, across, the, world, with, particularly, high, five, year, survival, in, japan, 33, and, five, year, survival, above, 20, in, 12, other, countries, mauritius, canada, the, us, china, south, korea, taiwan, israel, latvia, iceland, sweden, austria, and, switzerland, sclc, is, particularly, aggressive, 10, 15, of, people, survive, five, years, after, a, sclc, diagnosis, as, with, other, types, of, lung, cancer, the, extent, of, disease, at, diagnosis, also, influences, prognosis, the, average, person, diagnosed, with, limited, stage, sclc, survives, 12, 20, months, from, diagnosis, with, extensive, stage, sclc, around, 12, months, while, sclc, often, responds, initially, to, treatment, most, people, eventually, relapse, with, chemotherapy, resistant, cancer, surviving, an, average, 3, 4, months, from, the, time, of, relapse, those, with, limited, stage, sclc, that, go, into, complete, remission, after, chemotherapy, and, radiotherapy, have, a, 50, chance, of, brain, metastases, developing, within, the, next, two, years, a, chance, reduced, by, prophylactic, cranial, irradiation, several, other, personal, and, disease, factors, are, associated, with, improved, outcomes, those, diagnosed, at, a, younger, age, tend, to, have, better, outcomes, those, who, smoke, or, experience, weight, loss, as, a, symptom, tend, to, have, worse, outcomes, tumor, mutations, in, kras, are, associated, with, reduced, survival, the, uncertainty, of, lung, cancer, prognosis, often, causes, stress, and, makes, future, planning, difficult, for, those, with, lung, cancer, and, their, families, those, whose, cancer, goes, into, remission, often, experience, fear, of, their, cancer, returning, or, progressing, associated, with, poor, quality, of, life, negative, mood, and, functional, impairment, this, fear, is, exacerbated, by, frequent, or, prolonged, surveillance, imaging, and, other, reminders, of, cancer, risks, lung, cancer, is, caused, by, genetic, damage, to, the, dna, of, lung, cells, these, changes, are, sometimes, random, but, are, typically, induced, by, breathing, in, toxic, substances, such, as, cigarette, smoke, cancer, causing, genetic, changes, affect, the, cell, s, normal, functions, including, cell, proliferation, programmed, cell, death, apoptosis, and, dna, repair, eventually, cells, gain, enough, genetic, changes, to, grow, uncontrollably, forming, a, tumor, and, eventually, spreading, within, and, then, beyond, the, lung, rampant, tumor, growth, and, spread, causes, the, symptoms, of, lung, cancer, if, unstopped, the, spreading, tumor, will, eventually, cause, the, death, of, affected, individuals, tobacco, smoking, is, by, far, the, major, contributor, to, lung, cancer, causing, 80, to, 90, of, cases, lung, cancer, risk, increases, with, quantity, of, cigarettes, consumed, tobacco, smoking, s, carcinogenic, effect, is, due, to, various, chemicals, in, tobacco, smoke, that, cause, dna, mutations, increasing, the, chance, of, cells, becoming, cancerous, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, identifies, at, least, 50, chemicals, in, tobacco, smoke, as, carcinogenic, and, the, most, potent, is, tobacco, specific, nitrosamines, exposure, to, these, chemicals, causes, several, kinds, of, dna, damage, dna, adducts, oxidative, stress, and, breaks, in, the, dna, strands, being, around, tobacco, smoke, called, passive, smoking, can, also, cause, lung, cancer, living, with, a, tobacco, smoker, increases, one, s, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, by, 24, an, estimated, 17, of, lung, cancer, cases, in, those, who, do, not, smoke, are, caused, by, high, levels, of, environmental, tobacco, smoke, vaping, may, be, a, risk, factor, for, lung, cancer, but, less, than, that, of, cigarettes, and, further, research, as, of, 2021, is, necessary, due, to, the, length, of, time, it, can, take, for, lung, cancer, to, develop, following, an, exposure, to, carcinogens, the, smoking, of, non, tobacco, products, is, not, known, to, be, associated, with, lung, cancer, development, marijuana, smoking, does, not, seem, to, independently, cause, lung, cancer, despite, the, relatively, high, levels, of, tar, and, known, carcinogens, in, marijuana, smoke, the, relationship, between, smoking, cocaine, and, developing, lung, cancer, has, not, been, studied, as, of, 2020, exposure, to, a, variety, of, other, toxic, chemicals, typically, encountered, in, certain, occupations, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, lung, cancer, occupational, exposures, to, carcinogens, cause, 9, 15, of, lung, cancer, a, prominent, example, is, asbestos, which, causes, lung, cancer, either, directly, or, indirectly, by, inflaming, the, lung, exposure, to, all, commercially, available, forms, of, asbestos, increases, cancer, risk, and, cancer, risk, increases, with, time, of, exposure, asbestos, and, cigarette, smoking, increase, risk, synergistically, that, is, the, risk, of, someone, who, smokes, and, has, asbestos, exposure, dying, from, lung, cancer, is, much, higher, than, would, be, expected, from, adding, the, two, risks, together, similarly, exposure, to, radon, a, naturally, occurring, breakdown, product, of, the, earth, s, radioactive, elements, is, associated, with, increased, lung, cancer, risk, radon, levels, vary, with, geography, underground, miners, have, the, greatest, exposure, however, even, the, lower, levels, of, radon, that, seep, into, residential, spaces, can, increase, occupants, risk, of, lung, cancer, like, asbestos, cigarette, smoking, and, radon, exposure, increase, risk, synergistically, radon, exposure, is, responsible, for, between, 3, and, 14, of, lung, cancer, cases, several, other, chemicals, encountered, in, various, occupations, are, also, associated, with, increased, lung, cancer, risk, including, arsenic, used, in, wood, preservation, pesticide, application, and, some, ore, smelting, ionizing, radiation, encountered, during, uranium, mining, vinyl, chloride, in, papermaking, beryllium, in, jewelers, ceramics, workers, missile, technicians, and, nuclear, reactor, workers, chromium, in, stainless, steel, production, welding, and, hide, tanning, nickel, in, electroplaters, glass, workers, metal, workers, welders, and, those, who, make, batteries, ceramics, and, jewelry, and, diesel, exhaust, encountered, by, miners, exposure, to, air, pollution, especially, particulate, matter, released, by, motor, vehicle, exhaust, and, fossil, fuel, burning, power, plants, increases, the, risk, of, lung, cancer, indoor, air, pollution, from, burning, wood, charcoal, or, crop, residue, for, cooking, and, heating, has, also, been, linked, to, an, increased, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, has, classified, emission, from, household, burning, of, coal, and, biomass, as, carcinogenic, and, probably, carcinogenic, respectively, several, other, diseases, that, cause, inflammation, of, the, lung, increase, one, s, risk, of, lung, cancer, this, association, is, strongest, for, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disorder, the, risk, is, highest, in, those, with, the, most, inflammation, and, reduced, in, those, whose, inflammation, is, treated, with, inhaled, corticosteroids, other, inflammatory, lung, and, immune, system, diseases, such, as, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, deficiency, interstitial, fibrosis, scleroderma, chlamydia, pneumoniae, infection, tuberculosis, and, hiv, infection, are, associated, with, increased, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, epstein, barr, virus, is, associated, with, the, development, of, the, rare, lung, cancer, lymphoepithelioma, like, carcinoma, in, people, from, asia, but, not, in, people, from, western, nations, a, role, for, several, other, infectious, agents, namely, human, papillomaviruses, bk, virus, jc, virus, human, cytomegalovirus, sv40, measles, virus, and, torque, teno, virus, in, lung, cancer, development, has, been, studied, but, remains, inconclusive, as, of, 2020, particular, gene, combinations, may, make, some, people, more, susceptible, to, lung, cancer, close, family, members, of, those, with, lung, cancer, have, around, twice, the, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, as, an, average, person, even, after, controlling, for, occupational, exposure, and, smoking, habits, genome, wide, association, studies, have, identified, many, gene, variants, associated, with, lung, cancer, risk, each, of, which, contributes, a, small, risk, increase, many, of, these, genes, participate, in, pathways, known, to, be, involved, in, carcinogenesis, namely, dna, repair, inflammation, the, cell, division, cycle, cellular, stress, responses, and, chromatin, remodeling, some, rare, genetic, disorders, that, increase, the, risk, of, various, cancers, also, increase, the, risk, of, lung, cancer, namely, retinoblastoma, and, li, fraumeni, syndrome, as, with, all, cancers, lung, cancer, is, triggered, by, mutations, that, allow, tumor, cells, to, endlessly, multiply, stimulate, blood, vessel, growth, avoid, apoptosis, programmed, cell, death, generate, pro, growth, signalling, molecules, ignore, anti, growth, signalling, molecules, and, eventually, spread, into, surrounding, tissue, or, metastasize, throughout, the, body, different, tumors, can, acquire, these, abilities, through, different, mutations, though, generally, cancer, contributing, mutations, activate, oncogenes, and, inactivate, tumor, suppressors, some, mutations, called, driver, mutations, are, particularly, common, in, adenocarcinomas, and, contribute, disproportionately, to, tumor, development, these, typically, occur, in, the, receptor, tyrosine, kinases, egfr, braf, met, kras, and, pik3ca, similarly, some, adenocarcinomas, are, driven, by, chromosomal, rearrangements, that, result, in, overexpression, of, tyrosine, kinases, alk, ros1, ntrk, and, ret, a, given, tumor, will, typically, have, just, one, driver, mutation, in, contrast, sclcs, rarely, have, these, driver, mutations, and, instead, often, have, mutations, that, have, inactivated, the, tumor, suppressors, p53, and, rb, a, cluster, of, tumor, suppressor, genes, on, the, short, arm, of, chromosome, 3, are, often, lost, early, in, the, development, of, all, lung, cancers, those, who, smoke, can, reduce, their, lung, cancer, risk, by, quitting, smoking, the, risk, reduction, is, greater, the, longer, a, person, goes, without, smoking, self, help, programs, tend, to, have, little, influence, on, success, of, smoking, cessation, whereas, combined, counseling, and, pharmacotherapy, improve, cessation, rates, the, us, fda, has, approved, antidepressant, therapies, and, the, nicotine, replacement, varenicline, as, first, line, therapies, to, aid, in, smoking, cessation, clonidine, and, nortriptyline, are, recommended, second, line, therapies, the, majority, of, those, diagnosed, with, lung, cancer, attempt, to, quit, smoking, around, half, succeed, even, after, lung, cancer, diagnosis, smoking, cessation, improves, treatment, outcomes, reducing, cancer, treatment, toxicity, and, failure, rates, and, lengthening, survival, time, at, a, societal, level, smoking, cessation, can, be, promoted, by, tobacco, control, policies, that, make, tobacco, products, more, difficult, to, obtain, or, use, many, such, policies, are, mandated, or, recommended, by, the, who, framework, convention, on, tobacco, control, ratified, by, 182, countries, representing, over, 90, of, the, world, s, population, the, who, groups, these, policies, into, six, intervention, categories, each, of, which, has, been, shown, to, be, effective, in, reducing, the, cost, of, tobacco, induced, disease, burden, on, a, population, policies, implementing, each, intervention, are, associated, with, decreases, in, tobacco, smoking, prevalence, the, more, policies, implemented, the, greater, the, reduction, reducing, access, to, tobacco, for, adolescents, is, particularly, effective, at, decreasing, uptake, of, habitual, smoking, and, adolescent, demand, for, tobacco, products, is, particularly, sensitive, to, increases, in, cost, several, foods, and, dietary, supplements, have, been, associated, with, lung, cancer, risk, high, consumption, of, some, animal, products, red, meat, but, not, other, meats, or, fish, saturated, fats, as, well, as, nitrosamines, and, nitrites, found, in, salted, and, smoked, meats, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, in, contrast, high, consumption, of, fruits, and, vegetables, is, associated, with, a, reduced, risk, of, lung, cancer, particularly, consumption, of, cruciferous, vegetables, and, raw, fruits, and, vegetables, based, on, the, beneficial, effects, of, fruits, and, vegetables, supplementation, of, several, individual, vitamins, have, been, studied, supplementation, with, vitamin, a, or, beta, carotene, had, no, effect, on, lung, cancer, and, instead, slightly, increased, mortality, dietary, supplementation, with, vitamin, e, or, retinoids, similarly, had, no, effect, consumption, of, polyunsaturated, fats, tea, alcoholic, beverages, and, coffee, are, all, associated, with, reduced, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, along, with, diet, body, weight, and, exercise, habits, are, also, associated, with, lung, cancer, risk, being, overweight, is, associated, with, a, lower, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, possibly, due, to, the, tendency, of, those, who, smoke, cigarettes, to, have, a, lower, body, weight, however, being, underweight, is, also, associated, with, a, reduced, lung, cancer, risk, some, studies, have, shown, those, who, exercise, regularly, or, have, better, cardiovascular, fitness, to, have, a, lower, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, worldwide, lung, cancer, is, the, most, diagnosed, type, of, cancer, and, the, leading, cause, of, cancer, death, in, 2020, 2, 2, million, new, cases, were, diagnosed, and, 1, 8, million, people, died, from, lung, cancer, representing, 18, of, all, cancer, deaths, lung, cancer, deaths, are, expected, to, rise, globally, to, nearly, 3, million, annual, deaths, by, 2035, due, to, high, rates, of, tobacco, use, and, aging, populations, lung, cancer, is, rare, among, those, younger, than, 40, after, that, cancer, rates, increase, with, age, stabilizing, around, age, 80, the, median, age, of, a, person, diagnosed, with, lung, cancer, is, 70, the, median, age, of, death, is, 72, lung, cancer, incidence, varies, by, geography, and, sex, with, the, highest, rates, in, micronesia, polynesia, europe, asia, and, north, america, and, lowest, rates, in, africa, and, central, america, globally, around, 8, of, men, and, 6, of, women, develop, lung, cancer, in, their, lifetimes, the, ratio, of, lung, cancer, cases, in, men, to, women, varies, considerably, by, geography, from, as, high, as, nearly, 12, 1, in, belarus, to, 1, 1, in, brazil, likely, due, to, differences, in, smoking, patterns, lung, cancer, risk, is, influenced, by, environmental, exposure, namely, cigarette, smoking, as, well, as, occupational, risks, in, mining, shipbuilding, petroleum, refining, and, occupations, that, involve, asbestos, exposure, people, who, have, smoked, cigarettes, account, for, 85, 90, of, lung, cancer, cases, and, 15, of, smokers, develop, lung, cancer, non, smokers, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, is, also, influenced, by, tobacco, smoking, secondhand, smoke, that, is, being, around, tobacco, smoke, increases, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, around, 30, with, risk, correlated, to, duration, of, exposure, as, the, global, incidence, of, lung, cancer, decreases, in, parallel, with, declining, smoking, rates, in, developed, countries, the, incidence, of, lung, cancer, in, individuals, who, have, never, smoked, is, stable, or, increasing, lung, cancer, was, uncommon, before, the, advent, of, cigarette, smoking, surgeon, alton, ochsner, recalled, that, as, a, washington, university, medical, student, in, 1919, his, entire, medical, school, class, was, summoned, to, witness, an, autopsy, of, a, man, who, had, died, from, lung, cancer, and, told, they, may, never, see, such, a, case, again, in, isaac, adler, s, 1912, primary, malignant, growths, of, the, lungs, and, bronchi, he, called, lung, cancer, among, the, rarest, forms, of, disease, adler, tabulated, the, 374, cases, of, lung, cancer, that, had, been, published, to, that, time, concluding, the, disease, was, increasing, in, incidence, by, the, 1920s, several, theories, had, been, put, forward, linking, the, increase, in, lung, cancer, to, various, chemical, exposures, that, had, increased, including, tobacco, smoke, asphalt, dust, industrial, air, pollution, and, poisonous, gasses, from, world, war, i, over, the, following, decades, growing, scientific, evidence, linked, lung, cancer, to, cigarette, consumption, through, the, 1940s, and, early, 1950s, several, case, control, studies, showed, that, those, with, lung, cancer, were, more, likely, to, have, smoked, cigarettes, compared, to, those, without, lung, cancer, these, were, followed, by, several, prospective, cohort, studies, in, the, 1950s, including, the, first, report, of, the, british, doctors, study, in, 1954, all, of, which, showed, that, those, who, smoked, tobacco, were, at, dramatically, increased, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, a, 1953, study, showing, that, tar, from, cigarette, smoke, could, cause, tumors, in, mice, attracted, attention, in, the, popular, press, with, features, in, life, and, time, magazines, facing, public, concern, and, falling, stock, prices, the, ceos, of, six, of, the, largest, american, tobacco, companies, gathered, in, december, 1953, they, enlisted, the, help, of, public, relations, firm, hill, knowlton, to, craft, a, multi, pronged, strategy, aiming, to, distract, from, accumulating, evidence, by, funding, tobacco, friendly, research, declaring, the, link, to, lung, cancer, controversial, and, demanding, ever, more, research, to, settle, this, purported, controversy, at, the, same, time, internal, research, at, the, major, tobacco, companies, supported, the, link, between, tobacco, and, lung, cancer, though, these, results, were, kept, secret, from, the, public, as, evidence, linking, tobacco, use, with, lung, cancer, mounted, various, health, bodies, announced, official, positions, linking, the, two, in, 1962, the, united, kingdom, s, royal, college, of, physicians, officially, concluded, that, cigarette, smoking, causes, lung, cancer, prompting, the, united, states, surgeon, general, to, empanel, enroll, or, enlist, an, advisory, committee, which, deliberated, in, secret, over, nine, sessions, between, november, 1962, and, december, 1963, the, committee, s, report, published, in, january, 1964, firmly, concluded, that, cigarette, smoking, far, outweighs, all, other, factors, in, causing, lung, cancer, the, report, received, substantial, coverage, in, the, popular, press, and, is, widely, seen, as, a, turning, point, for, public, recognition, that, tobacco, smoking, causes, lung, cancer, the, connection, with, radon, gas, was, first, recognized, among, miners, in, germany, s, ore, mountains, as, early, as, 1500, miners, were, noted, to, develop, a, deadly, disease, called, mountain, sickness, bergkrankheit, identified, as, lung, cancer, by, the, late, 19th, century, by, 1938, up, to, 80, of, miners, in, affected, regions, died, from, the, disease, in, the, 1950s, radon, and, its, breakdown, products, became, established, as, causes, of, lung, cancer, in, miners, based, largely, on, studies, of, miners, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, classified, radon, as, carcinogenic, to, humans, in, 1988, in, 1956, a, study, revealed, radon, in, swedish, residences, over, the, following, decades, high, radon, concentrations, were, found, in, residences, across, the, world, by, the, 1980s, many, countries, had, established, national, radon, programs, to, catalog, and, mitigate, residential, radon, the, first, successful, pneumonectomy, for, lung, cancer, was, performed, in, 1933, by, evarts, graham, at, barnes, hospital, in, st, louis, missouri, over, the, following, decades, surgical, development, focused, on, sparing, as, much, healthy, lung, tissue, as, possible, with, the, lobectomy, surpassing, the, pneumectomy, in, frequency, by, the, 1960s, and, the, wedge, resection, appearing, in, the, early, 1970s, this, trend, continued, with, the, development, of, video, assisted, thoracoscopic, surgery, in, the, 1980s, now, widely, performed, for, many, lung, cancer, surgeries, while, lung, cancer, is, the, deadliest,
