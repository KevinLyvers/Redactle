sample, for, the, antibodies, associated, with, typhus, it, can, also, be, done, with, either, immunohistochemistry, ihc, or, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, tests, excluding, scrub, typhus, scrub, typhus, is, not, tested, with, ihc, or, pcr, but, is, instead, tested, with, the, ifa, test, as, well, as, indirect, immunuoperoxidase, iip, assays, as, of, 2024, no, vaccine, is, commercially, available, a, vaccine, has, been, in, development, for, scrub, typhus, known, as, the, scrub, typhus, vaccine, scrub, typhus, is, caused, by, mites, so, avoid, the, outdoors, when, scrub, is, common,

highest, risk, of, death, in, the, antibiotic, era, death, is, uncommon, if, doxycycline, is, given, in, one, study, of, 60, people, hospitalized, with, epidemic, typhus, no, one, died, when, given, doxycycline, or, chloramphenicol, according, to, the, world, health, organization, in, 2010, the, death, rate, from, typhus, was, about, one, of, every, 5, 000, 000, people, per, year, only, a, few, areas, of, epidemic, typhus, exist, today, since, the, late, 20th, century, cases, have, been, reported, in, burundi, rwanda, ethiopia, algeria, and, a, few, areas, in, south, and, central, america, except, for, two, cases, all, instances, of, epidemic, typhus, in, the, united, states, have, occurred, east, of, the, mississippi, river, an, examination, of, a, cluster, of, cases, in, pennsylvania, concluded, the, source, of, the, infection, was, flying, squirrels, sylvatic, cycle, diseases, transmitted, from, wild, animals, epidemic, typhus, remains, uncommon, in, the, us, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, have, documented, only, 47, cases, from, 1976, to, 2010, an, outbreak, of, flea, borne, murine, typhus, was, identified, in, downtown, los, angeles, california, in,

soldiers, died, of, typhus, than, were, killed, by, the, russians, a, major, epidemic, occurred, in, ireland, between, 1816, and, 1819, during, the, famine, caused, by, a, worldwide, reduction, in, temperature, known, as, the, year, without, a, summer, an, estimated, 100, 000, people, perished, typhus, appeared, again, in, the, late, 1830s, and, yet, another, major, typhus, epidemic, occurred, during, the, great, irish, famine, between, 1846, and, 1849, the, typhus, outbreak, along, with, typhoid, fever, is, said, to, be, responsible, for, 400, 000, deaths, the, irish, typhus, spread, to,

the, sick, in, 1922, the, typhus, epidemic, reached, its, peak, in, soviet, territory, with, some, 20, to, 30, million, cases, in, russia, although, typhus, had, ravaged, poland, with, some, 4, million, cases, reported, efforts, to, stem, the, spread, of, disease, in, that, country, had, largely, succeeded, by, 1921, through, the, efforts, of, public, health, pioneers, such, as, h, l, ne,
