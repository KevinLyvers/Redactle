the, swordfish, xiphias, gladius, also, known, as, the, broadbill, in, some, countries, are, large, highly, migratory, predatory, fish, characterized, by, a, long, flat, pointed, bill, they, are, a, popular, sport, fish, of, the, billfish, category, though, elusive, swordfish, are, elongated, round, bodied, and, lose, all, teeth, and, scales, by, adulthood, these, fish, are, found, widely, in, tropical, and, temperate, parts, of, the, atlantic, pacific, and, indian, oceans, and, can, typically, be, found, from, near, the, surface, to, a, depth, of, 550, m, 1, 800, ft, and, exceptionally, up, to, depths, of, 2, 234, m, they, commonly, reach, 3, m, 10, ft, in, length, and, the, maximum, reported, is, 4, 55, m, 14, ft, 11, in, in, length, and, 650, kg, 1, 430, lb, in, weight, they, are, the, sole, member, of, their, family, xiphiidae, the, swordfish, is, named, after, its, long, pointed, flat, bill, which, resembles, a, sword, the, species, name, xiphias, gladius, derives, from, greek, xiphias, swordfish, itself, from, xiphos, sword, and, from, latin, gladius, sword, this, makes, it, superficially, similar, to, other, billfish, such, as, marlin, but, upon, examination, their, physiology, is, quite, different, and, they, are, members, of, different, families, several, extinct, genera, are, known, such, as, a, large, sized, xiphiorhynchus, and, aglyptorhynchus, unlike, modern, taxa, these, have, equally, long, lower, jaws, they, commonly, reach, 3, m, 10, ft, in, length, and, the, maximum, reported, is, 4, 55, m, 14, ft, 11, in, in, length, and, 682, kg, 1, 500, lb, in, weight, the, international, game, fish, association, s, all, tackle, angling, record, for, a, swordfish, was, a, 536, kg, 1, 182, lb, specimen, taken, off, chile, in, 1953, females, are, larger, than, males, and, pacific, swordfish, reach, a, greater, size, than, northwest, atlantic, and, mediterranean, swordfish, they, reach, maturity, at, 4, 5, years, of, age, and, the, maximum, age, is, believed, to, be, at, least, 9, years, the, oldest, swordfish, found, in, a, recent, study, were, a, 16, year, old, female, and, 12, year, old, male, swordfish, ages, are, derived, with, difficulty, from, annual, rings, on, fin, rays, rather, than, otoliths, since, their, otoliths, are, small, in, size, swordfish, are, ectothermic, animals, along, with, some, species, of, sharks, they, have, special, organs, next, to, their, eyes, called, heater, cells, which, function, to, heat, their, eyes, and, brains, their, eyes, are, heated, to, temperatures, measured, between, 10, and, 15, c, 18, and, 27, f, above, the, surrounding, water, temperature, this, heating, greatly, improves, their, vision, and, consequently, their, predatory, efficacy, the, swordfish, is, one, of, 22, species, of, fish, including, the, marlin, tuna, and, some, sharks, known, to, have, a, heat, conservation, mechanism, the, popular, image, of, the, swordfish, skewering, its, prey, with, its, nose, is, based, on, little, evidence, in, a, typical, environment, swordfish, most, likely, use, their, noses, to, slash, at, prey, and, inflict, weakening, injuries, the, hypothesis, that, they, may, use, their, noses, as, spears, in, a, defensive, capacity, against, sharks, and, other, predators, is, still, under, review, mainly, the, swordfish, relies, on, its, great, speed, and, agility, in, the, water, to, catch, its, prey, it, is, no, doubt, among, the, fastest, fish, but, the, basis, for, the, frequently, quoted, speed, of, 100, km, h, 60, mph, is, unreliable, research, on, related, marlin, istiophorus, platypterus, suggest, a, maximum, value, of, 36, km, h, 22, mph, is, more, likely, swordfish, are, not, schooling, fish, they, swim, alone, or, in, very, loose, aggregations, separated, by, as, much, as, 10, m, 35, ft, from, a, neighboring, swordfish, they, are, frequently, found, basking, at, the, surface, airing, their, first, dorsal, fin, boaters, report, this, to, be, a, beautiful, sight, as, is, the, powerful, jumping, for, which, the, species, is, known, this, jumping, also, called, breaching, may, be, an, effort, to, dislodge, pests, such, as, remoras, or, lampreys, swordfish, prefer, water, temperatures, between, 18, and, 22, c, 64, and, 72, f, but, have, the, widest, tolerance, among, billfish, and, can, be, found, from, 5, to, 27, c, 41, to, 81, f, this, highly, migratory, species, typically, moves, towards, colder, regions, to, feed, during, the, summer, swordfish, feed, daily, most, often, at, night, when, they, rise, to, surface, and, near, surface, waters, in, search, of, smaller, fish, during, the, day, they, commonly, occur, to, depths, of, 550, m, 1, 800, ft, 300, fathoms, and, have, exceptionally, been, recorded, as, deep, as, 2, 878, m, 9, 442, ft, 1, 574, fathoms, adults, feed, on, a, wide, range, of, pelagic, fish, such, as, mackerel, barracudinas, silver, hake, rockfish, herring, and, lanternfishes, but, they, also, take, demersal, fish, squid, and, crustaceans, in, the, northwestern, atlantic, a, survey, based, on, the, stomach, content, of, 168, individuals, found, 82, had, eaten, squid, and, 53, had, eaten, fish, including, gadids, scombrids, butterfish, bluefish, and, sand, lance, large, prey, are, typically, slashed, with, the, sword, while, small, are, swallowed, whole, almost, 50, species, of, parasites, have, been, documented, in, swordfish, in, addition, to, remoras, lampreys, and, cookiecutter, sharks, this, includes, a, wide, range, of, invertebrates, such, as, tapeworms, roundworms, myxozoans, and, copepods, a, comparison, of, the, parasites, of, swordfish, in, the, atlantic, and, in, the, mediterranean, indicated, that, some, parasites, particularly, anisakis, spp, larvae, identified, by, genetic, markers, could, be, used, as, biological, tags, and, support, the, existence, of, a, mediterranean, swordfish, stock, fully, adult, swordfish, have, few, natural, predators, among, marine, mammals, killer, whales, sometimes, prey, on, adult, swordfish, it, is, believed, that, sperm, whales, may, also, prey, on, swordfish, on, rare, occasions, the, shortfin, mako, an, exceptionally, fast, species, of, shark, sometimes, take, on, swordfish, dead, or, dying, shortfin, makos, have, been, found, with, broken, off, swords, in, their, heads, revealing, the, danger, of, this, type, of, prey, juvenile, swordfish, are, far, more, vulnerable, to, predation, and, are, eaten, by, a, wide, range, of, predatory, fish, intensive, fishery, may, be, driving, swordfishes, and, sharks, into, harder, competition, for, reduced, amounts, of, prey, and, therefore, pitting, them, to, fight, more, human, fishery, is, a, major, predator, of, swordfishes, the, annual, reported, catch, in, 2019, of, the, north, atlantic, swordfish, amounted, to, a, total, of, 1, 3, million, kilograms, 2, 9, million, pounds, in, the, north, pacific, batch, spawning, mainly, occurs, in, water, warmer, than, 24, c, 75, f, during, the, spring, and, summer, and, year, round, in, the, equatorial, pacific, in, the, north, atlantic, spawning, is, known, from, the, sargasso, sea, and, in, water, warmer, than, 23, c, 73, f, and, less, than, 75, m, 246, ft, 41, fathoms, deep, spawning, occurs, from, november, to, february, in, the, south, atlantic, off, southern, brazil, spawning, is, year, round, in, the, caribbean, sea, and, other, warm, regions, of, the, west, atlantic, large, females, can, carry, more, eggs, than, small, females, and, between, 1, million, and, 29, million, eggs, have, been, recorded, the, pelagic, eggs, measure, 1, 6, 1, 8, mm, 1, 16, 5, 64, in, in, diameter, and, 2, 1, 2, days, after, fertilization, the, embryonic, development, occurs, the, surface, living, and, unique, looking, larvae, are, 4, mm, 5, 32, in, long, at, hatching, the, bill, is, evident, when, the, larvae, reach, 1, cm, 3, 8, in, in, length, swordfish, were, harvested, by, a, variety, of, methods, at, small, scale, notably, harpoon, fishing, until, the, global, expansion, of, long, line, fishing, they, have, been, fished, widely, since, ancient, times, in, places, such, as, the, strait, of, messina, where, they, are, still, fished, with, traditional, wooden, boats, called, feluccas, and, are, part, of, the, cuisine, in, that, area, swordfish, are, vigorous, powerful, fighters, although, no, unprovoked, attacks, on, humans, have, been, reported, swordfish, can, be, very, dangerous, when, harpooned, they, have, run, their, swords, through, the, planking, of, small, boats, when, hurt, in, 2015, a, hawaiian, fisherman, was, killed, by, a, swordfish, after, attempting, to, spear, the, animal, recreational, fishing, has, developed, a, subspecialty, called, swordfishing, because, of, a, ban, on, long, lining, along, many, parts, of, seashore, swordfish, populations, are, showing, signs, of, recovery, from, the, overfishing, caused, by, long, lining, along, the, coast, various, ways, are, used, to, fish, for, swordfish, but, the, most, common, method, is, deep, drop, fishing, since, swordfish, spend, most, daylight, hours, very, deep, in, the, deep, scattering, layer, the, boat, is, allowed, to, drift, to, present, a, more, natural, bait, swordfishing, requires, strong, fishing, rods, and, reels, as, swordfish, can, become, quite, large, and, it, is, not, uncommon, to, use, 2, 5, kg, 5, lb, or, more, of, weight, to, get, the, baits, deep, enough, during, the, day, up, to, 460, m, 1, 500, ft, is, common, night, fishing, baits, are, usually, fished, much, shallower, often, less, than, 90, m, 300, ft, 50, fathoms, standard, baits, are, whole, mackerel, herring, mullet, bonito, or, squid, one, can, also, use, live, bait, imitation, squids, and, other, imitation, fish, lures, can, also, be, used, and, specialized, lures, made, specifically, for, swordfishing, often, have, battery, powered, or, glow, lights, even, baits, are, typically, presented, using, glow, sticks, or, specialized, deepwater, proof, battery, operated, lights, swordfish, are, classified, as, oily, fish, many, sources, including, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, warn, about, potential, toxicity, from, high, levels, of, methylmercury, in, swordfish, the, fda, recommends, that, young, children, pregnant, women, and, women, planning, to, become, pregnant, not, eat, swordfish, the, flesh, of, some, swordfish, can, acquire, an, orange, tint, reportedly, from, their, diet, of, shrimp, or, other, prey, such, fish, are, sold, as, pumpkin, swordfish, and, command, a, premium, over, their, whitish, counterparts, swordfish, is, a, particularly, popular, fish, for, cooking, since, swordfish, are, large, meat, is, usually, sold, as, steaks, which, are, often, grilled, swordfish, meat, is, relatively, firm, and, can, be, cooked, in, ways, more, fragile, types, of, fish, cannot, such, as, over, a, grill, on, skewers, the, color, of, the, flesh, varies, by, diet, with, fish, caught, on, the, east, coast, of, north, america, often, being, rosier, a, dispute, exists, as, to, whether, swordfish, should, be, considered, a, kosher, fish, according, to, the, laws, of, kashrut, standard, orthodox, opinion, is, that, swordfish, is, not, kosher, while, conservative, judaism, does, consider, swordfish, kosher, all, kosher, fish, must, have, both, fins, and, scales, the, talmud, and, the, tosefta, are, believed, by, some, to, present, swordfish, achsaftias, as, an, example, of, a, kosher, fish, without, scales, because, swordfish, are, born, with, scales, they, later, shed, once, attaining, a, length, of, about, 1, meter, the, 17th, century, turkish, sephardi, halakhic, authority, rabbi, chaim, ben, yisrael, benvenisti, wrote, that, it, is, a, widespread, custom, among, all, jews, to, eat, the, fish, with, the, sword, known, in, vernacular, as, fishei, espada, even, though, it, does, not, have, any, scales, because, it, is, said, that, when, it, comes, out, of, the, water, due, to, its, anger, it, shakes, and, throws, off, its, scales, a, 1933, list, of, kosher, fish, published, by, the, agudas, harabbonim, includes, swordfish, the, following, year, rabbi, yosef, kanowitz, published, the, same, list, of, kosher, fish, with, swordfish, still, included, swordfish, was, widely, considered, kosher, by, halakhic, authorities, until, the, 1950s, orthodox, opinion, began, to, shift, in, 1951, when, rabbi, moshe, tendler, examined, swordfish, and, decided, it, was, not, kosher, due, to, the, lack, of, scales, tendler, s, opinion, provoked, strong, debate, among, halakhic, authorities, during, the, 1960s, among, mediterranean, jews, there, was, a, longstanding, minhag, of, considering, swordfish, kosher, swordfish, was, and, possibly, still, is, consumed, by, jews, in, italy, turkey, gibraltar, morocco, tunisia, and, england, due, to, tendler, s, opinion, swordfish, are, generally, not, considered, kosher, by, orthodox, jews, in, the, united, states, and, israel, in, 1998, the, u, s, natural, resources, defense, council, and, seaweb, hired, fenton, communications, to, conduct, an, advertising, campaign, to, promote, their, assertion, that, the, swordfish, population, was, in, danger, due, to, its, popularity, as, a, restaurant, entree, the, resulting, give, swordfish, a, break, promotion, was, wildly, successful, with, 750, prominent, u, s, chefs, agreeing, to, remove, north, atlantic, swordfish, from, their, menus, and, also, persuaded, many, supermarkets, and, consumers, across, the, country, the, advertising, campaign, was, repeated, by, the, national, media, in, hundreds, of, print, and, broadcast, stories, as, well, as, extensive, regional, coverage, it, earned, the, silver, anvil, award, from, the, public, relations, society, of, america, as, well, as, time, magazine, s, award, for, the, top, five, environmental, stories, of, 1998, subsequently, the, u, s, national, marine, fisheries, service, proposed, a, swordfish, protection, plan, that, incorporated, the, campaign, s, policy, suggestions, then, us, president, bill, clinton, called, for, a, ban, on, the, sale, and, import, of, swordfish, and, in, a, landmark, decision, by, the, federal, government, 343, 600, km, 2, 132, 670, sq, mi, of, the, atlantic, ocean, were, placed, off, limits, to, fishing, as, recommended, by, the, sponsors, in, the, north, atlantic, the, swordfish, stock, is, fully, rebuilt, with, biomass, estimates, currently, 5, above, the, target, level, no, robust, stock, assessments, for, swordfish, in, the, northwestern, pacific, or, south, atlantic, have, been, made, and, data, concerning, stock, status, in, these, regions, are, lacking, these, stocks, are, considered, unknown, and, a, moderate, conservation, concern, the, southwestern, pacific, stock, is, a, moderate, concern, due, to, model, uncertainty, increasing, catches, and, declining, catch, per, unit, effort, overfishing, is, likely, occurring, in, the, indian, ocean, and, fishing, mortality, exceeds, the, maximum, recommended, level, in, the, mediterranean, thus, these, stocks, are, considered, of, high, conservation, concern, in, 2010, greenpeace, international, added, the, swordfish, to, its, seafood, red, list, the, swordfish, xiphias, has, been, used, by, astronomers, as, another, name, for, the, constellation, of, dorado, the, word, swordfish, is, used, as, a, password, in, the, 1932, marx, brothers, film, horse, feathers, it, has, since, appeared, as, a, password, in, many, films, television, series, books, and, videogames
