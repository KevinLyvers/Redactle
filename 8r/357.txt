mites, are, small, arachnids, eight, legged, arthropods, mites, span, two, large, orders, of, arachnids, the, acariformes, and, the, parasitiformes, which, were, historically, grouped, together, in, the, subclass, acari, however, most, recent, genetic, analyses, do, not, recover, the, two, as, each, other, s, closest, relative, within, arachnida, rendering, the, group, non, monophyletic, most, mites, are, tiny, less, than, 1, mm, 0, 04, in, in, length, and, have, a, simple, unsegmented, body, plan, the, small, size, of, most, species, makes, them, easily, overlooked, some, species, live, in, water, many, live, in, soil, as, decomposers, others, live, on, plants, sometimes, creating, galls, while, others, are, predators, or, parasites, this, last, type, includes, the, commercially, destructive, varroa, parasite, of, honey, bees, as, well, as, scabies, mites, of, humans, most, species, are, harmless, to, humans, but, a, few, are, associated, with, allergies, or, may, transmit, diseases, the, scientific, discipline, devoted, to, the, study, of, mites, is, called, acarology, the, mites, are, not, a, defined, taxon, but, is, used, for, two, distinct, groups, of, arachnids, the, acariformes, and, the, parasitiformes, the, phylogeny, of, the, acari, has, been, relatively, little, studied, but, molecular, information, from, ribosomal, dna, is, being, extensively, used, to, understand, relationships, between, groups, the, 18, s, rrna, gene, provides, information, on, relationships, among, phyla, and, superphyla, while, the, its2, and, the, 18s, ribosomal, rna, and, 28s, ribosomal, rna, genes, provide, clues, at, deeper, levels, the, mite, fossil, record, is, sparse, due, to, their, small, size, and, low, preservation, potential, the, oldest, fossils, of, acariform, mites, are, from, the, rhynie, chert, scotland, which, dates, to, the, early, devonian, around, 410, million, years, ago, while, the, earliest, fossils, of, parasitiformes, are, known, from, amber, specimens, dating, to, the, mid, cretaceous, around, 100, million, years, ago, most, fossil, acarids, are, no, older, than, the, tertiary, up, to, 65, mya, members, of, the, superorders, opilioacariformes, and, acariformes, sometimes, known, as, actinotrichida, are, mites, as, well, as, some, of, the, parasitiformes, sometimes, known, as, anactinotrichida, recent, genetic, research, has, suggested, that, acari, is, polyphyletic, of, multiple, origins, a, study, using, molecular, data, from, the, mitochondria, and, nucleus, recovered, acariformes, as, sister, to, the, solifugae, camel, spiders, and, parasitiformes, as, sister, to, the, pseudoscorpionida, with, other, arachnid, orders, separating, these, two, groupings, on, the, phylogenetic, tree, as, shown, below, palpigradi, false, scorpions, ixodida, ticks, parasitic, mites, inc, varroa, trombidiformes, chiggers, velvet, mites, etc, sarcoptiformes, dust, fur, mites, etc, camel, spiders, other, arachnids, including, spiders, and, scorpions, however, a, few, phylogenomic, studies, have, found, strong, support, for, monophyly, of, acari, and, a, sister, relationship, between, acariformes, and, parasitiformes, although, this, finding, has, been, questioned, with, other, studies, suggesting, that, this, likely, represents, a, long, branch, attraction, artefact, mites, are, tiny, members, of, the, class, arachnida, most, are, in, the, size, range, 250, to, 750, m, 0, 01, to, 0, 03, in, but, some, are, larger, and, some, are, no, bigger, than, 100, m, 0, 004, in, as, adults, the, body, plan, has, two, regions, a, cephalothorax, with, no, separate, head, or, prosoma, and, an, opisthosoma, or, abdomen, segmentation, has, almost, entirely, been, lost, and, the, prosoma, and, opisthosoma, are, fused, only, the, positioning, of, the, limbs, indicating, the, location, of, the, segments, at, the, front, of, the, body, is, the, gnathosoma, or, capitulum, this, is, not, a, head, and, does, not, contain, the, eyes, or, the, brain, but, is, a, retractable, feeding, apparatus, consisting, of, the, chelicerae, the, pedipalps, and, the, oral, cavity, it, is, covered, above, by, an, extension, of, the, body, carapace, and, is, connected, to, the, body, by, a, flexible, section, of, cuticle, two, segmented, chelicerae, is, the, ancestral, condition, in, acariformes, but, in, more, derived, groups, they, are, single, segmented, and, three, segmented, chelicerae, is, the, ancestral, condition, in, parasitiformes, but, has, been, reduced, to, just, two, segments, in, more, derived, groups, the, pedipalps, differ, between, taxa, depending, on, diet, in, some, species, the, appendages, resemble, legs, while, in, others, they, are, modified, into, chelicerae, like, structures, the, oral, cavity, connects, posteriorly, to, the, mouth, and, pharynx, most, mites, have, four, pairs, of, legs, two, pairs, in, eriophyoidea, each, with, six, segments, which, may, be, modified, for, swimming, or, other, purposes, the, dorsal, surface, of, the, body, is, clad, in, hardened, tergites, and, the, ventral, surface, by, hardened, sclerites, sometimes, these, form, transverse, ridges, the, gonopore, genital, opening, is, located, on, the, ventral, surface, between, the, fourth, pair, of, legs, some, species, have, one, to, five, median, or, lateral, eyes, but, many, species, are, blind, and, slit, and, pit, sense, organs, are, common, both, body, and, limbs, bear, setae, bristles, which, may, be, simple, flattened, club, shaped, or, sensory, mites, are, usually, some, shade, of, brown, but, some, species, are, red, orange, black, or, green, or, some, combination, of, these, colours, many, mites, have, stigmata, openings, used, in, respiration, in, some, mites, the, stigmata, are, associated, with, peritremes, paired, tubular, elaborated, extensions, of, the, tracheal, system, the, higher, taxa, of, mites, are, defined, by, these, structures, mite, digestive, systems, have, salivary, glands, that, open, into, the, preoral, space, rather, than, the, foregut, most, species, carry, two, to, six, pairs, of, salivary, glands, that, empty, at, various, points, into, the, subcheliceral, space, a, few, mite, species, lack, an, anus, they, do, not, defecate, during, their, short, lives, the, circulatory, system, consists, of, a, network, of, sinuses, and, most, mites, lacks, a, heart, movement, of, fluid, being, driven, by, the, contraction, of, body, muscles, but, ticks, and, some, of, the, larger, species, of, mites, have, a, dorsal, longitudinal, heart, gas, exchange, is, carried, out, across, the, body, surface, but, many, species, additionally, have, between, one, and, four, pairs, of, tracheae, the, excretory, system, includes, a, nephridium, and, one, or, two, pairs, of, malpighian, tubules, several, families, of, mites, such, as, tetranychidae, eriophyidae, camerobiidae, cunaxidae, trombidiidae, trombiculidae, erythraeidae, and, bdellidae, have, silk, glands, used, to, produce, silk, for, various, purposes, additionally, water, mites, hydrachnidia, produce, long, thin, threads, that, may, be, silk, the, sexes, are, separate, in, mites, males, have, a, pair, of, testes, in, the, mid, region, of, the, body, each, connected, to, the, gonopore, by, a, vas, deferens, and, in, some, species, there, is, a, chitinous, penis, females, have, a, single, ovary, connected, to, the, gonopore, by, an, oviduct, as, well, as, a, seminal, receptacle, for, the, storage, of, sperm, in, most, mites, sperm, is, transferred, to, the, female, indirectly, the, male, either, deposits, a, spermatophore, on, a, surface, from, which, it, is, picked, up, by, the, female, or, he, uses, his, chelicerae, or, third, pair, of, legs, to, insert, it, into, the, female, s, gonopore, in, some, of, the, acariformes, insemination, is, direct, using, the, male, s, penis, the, spermatophora, in, all, mites, are, aflagellate, the, eggs, are, laid, in, the, substrate, or, wherever, the, mite, happens, to, live, they, take, up, to, six, weeks, to, hatch, according, to, species, with, the, next, stage, being, the, six, legged, larvae, after, three, moults, the, larvae, become, nymphs, with, eight, legs, and, after, a, further, three, moults, they, become, adults, longevity, varies, between, species, but, the, lifespan, of, mites, is, short, compared, to, many, other, arachnids, mites, occupy, a, wide, range, of, ecological, niches, for, example, oribatida, mites, are, important, decomposers, in, many, habitats, they, eat, a, wide, variety, of, material, including, living, and, dead, plant, and, fungal, material, lichens, and, carrion, some, are, predatory, though, no, oribatid, mites, are, parasitic, mites, are, among, the, most, diverse, and, successful, of, all, invertebrate, groups, they, have, exploited, a, wide, array, of, habitats, and, because, of, their, small, size, go, largely, unnoticed, they, are, found, in, freshwater, e, g, the, water, mites, or, hydrachnidia, and, saltwater, most, halacaridae, in, the, soil, in, forests, pastures, agricultural, crops, ornamental, plants, thermal, springs, and, caves, they, inhabit, organic, debris, of, all, kinds, and, are, extremely, numerous, in, leaf, litter, they, feed, on, animals, plants, and, fungi, and, some, are, parasites, of, plants, and, animals, some, 48, 200, species, of, mites, have, been, described, but, there, may, be, a, million, or, more, species, as, yet, undescribed, the, tropical, species, archegozetes, longisetosus, is, one, of, the, strongest, animals, in, the, world, relative, to, its, mass, 100, g, it, lifts, up, to, 1, 182, times, its, own, weight, over, five, times, more, than, would, be, expected, of, such, a, minute, animal, a, mite, also, holds, a, speed, record, for, its, length, paratarsotomus, macropalpis, is, the, fastest, animal, on, earth, the, mites, living, in, soil, consist, of, a, range, of, taxa, oribatida, and, prostigmata, are, more, numerous, in, soil, than, mesostigmata, and, have, more, soil, dwelling, species, when, soil, is, affected, by, an, ecological, disturbance, such, as, agriculture, most, mites, astigmata, mesostigmata, and, prostigmata, recolonise, it, within, a, few, months, whereas, oribatida, take, multiple, years, many, mites, are, parasitic, on, plants, and, animals, one, family, of, mites, pyroglyphidae, or, nest, mites, live, primarily, in, the, nests, of, birds, and, other, animals, these, mites, are, largely, parasitic, and, consume, blood, skin, and, keratin, dust, mites, which, feed, mostly, on, dead, skin, and, hair, shed, from, humans, instead, of, consuming, them, from, the, organism, directly, evolved, from, these, parasitic, ancestors, ticks, are, a, prominent, group, of, mites, that, are, parasitic, on, vertebrates, mostly, mammal, and, birds, feeding, on, blood, with, specialised, mouthparts, parasitic, mites, sometimes, infest, insects, varroa, destructor, attaches, to, the, body, of, honey, bees, and, acarapis, woodi, family, tarsonemidae, lives, in, their, tracheae, hundreds, of, species, are, associated, with, other, bees, mostly, poorly, described, they, attach, to, bees, in, a, variety, of, ways, for, example, trigona, corvina, workers, have, been, found, with, mites, attached, to, the, outer, face, of, their, hind, tibiae, some, are, thought, to, be, parasites, while, others, are, beneficial, symbionts, mites, also, parasitize, some, ant, species, such, as, eciton, burchellii, most, larvae, of, parasitengona, are, ectoparasites, of, arthropods, while, later, life, stages, in, this, group, tend, to, shift, to, being, predators, plant, pests, include, the, so, called, spider, mites, family, tetranychidae, thread, footed, mites, family, tarsonemidae, and, the, gall, mites, family, eriophyidae, among, the, species, that, attack, animals, are, members, of, the, sarcoptic, mange, mites, family, sarcoptidae, which, burrow, under, the, skin, demodex, mites, family, demodecidae, are, parasites, that, live, in, or, near, the, hair, follicles, of, mammals, including, humans, being, unable, to, fly, mites, need, some, other, means, of, dispersal, on, a, small, scale, walking, is, used, to, access, other, suitable, locations, in, the, immediate, vicinity, some, species, mount, to, a, high, point, and, adopt, a, dispersal, posture, and, get, carried, away, by, the, wind, while, others, waft, a, thread, of, silk, aloft, to, balloon, to, a, new, position, parasitic, mites, use, their, hosts, to, disperse, and, spread, from, host, to, host, by, direct, contact, another, strategy, is, phoresy, the, mite, often, equipped, with, suitable, claspers, or, suckers, grips, onto, an, insect, or, other, animal, and, gets, transported, to, another, place, a, phoretic, mite, is, just, a, hitch, hiker, and, does, not, feed, during, the, time, it, is, carried, by, its, temporary, host, these, travelling, mites, are, mostly, species, that, reproduce, rapidly, and, are, quick, to, colonise, new, habitats, mites, are, tiny, and, apart, from, those, that, are, of, economic, concern, to, humans, little, studied, the, majority, are, beneficial, living, in, the, soil, or, aqueous, environments, and, assisting, in, the, decomposition, of, decaying, organic, material, as, part, of, the, carbon, cycle, two, species, live, on, humans, namely, demodex, folliculorum, and, demodex, brevis, both, are, frequently, referred, to, as, eyelash, mites, the, majority, of, mite, species, are, harmless, to, humans, and, domestic, animals, but, a, few, species, can, colonize, mammals, directly, acting, as, vectors, for, disease, transmission, and, causing, or, contributing, to, allergenic, diseases, mites, which, colonize, human, skin, are, the, cause, of, several, types, of, itchy, skin, rashes, such, as, gamasoidosis, rodent, mite, dermatitis, grain, itch, grocer, s, itch, and, scabies, sarcoptes, scabiei, is, a, parasitic, mite, responsible, for, scabies, which, is, one, of, the, three, most, common, skin, disorders, in, children, demodex, mites, which, are, common, cause, of, mange, in, dogs, and, other, domesticated, animals, have, also, been, implicated, in, the, human, skin, disease, rosacea, although, the, mechanism, by, which, demodex, contributes, to, the, disease, is, unclear, ticks, are, well, known, for, carrying, diseases, such, as, lyme, disease, and, rocky, mountain, spotted, fever, chiggers, are, known, primarily, for, their, itchy, bite, but, they, can, also, spread, disease, in, some, limited, circumstances, such, as, scrub, typhus, the, house, mouse, mite, is, the, only, known, vector, of, the, disease, rickettsialpox, house, dust, mites, found, in, warm, and, humid, places, such, as, beds, cause, several, forms, of, allergic, diseases, including, hay, fever, asthma, and, eczema, and, are, known, to, aggravate, atopic, dermatitis, among, domestic, animals, sheep, are, affected, by, the, mite, psoroptes, ovis, which, lives, on, the, skin, causing, hypersensitivity, and, inflammation, hay, mites, are, a, suspected, reservoir, for, scrapie, a, prion, disease, of, sheep, the, mite, varroa, destructor, is, a, serious, pest, of, honey, bees, contributing, to, colony, collapse, disorder, in, commercial, hives, this, organism, is, an, obligate, external, parasite, able, to, reproduce, only, in, bee, colonies, it, directly, weakens, its, host, by, sucking, up, the, bee, s, fat, and, can, spread, rna, viruses, including, deformed, wing, virus, heavy, infestation, causes, the, death, of, a, colony, generally, over, the, winter, since, 2006, more, than, 10, million, beehives, have, been, lost, various, mites, prey, on, other, invertebrates, and, can, be, used, to, control, their, populations, phytoseiidae, especially, members, of, amblyseius, metaseiulus, and, phytoseiulus, are, used, to, control, pests, such, as, spider, mites, among, the, laelapidae, gaeolaelaps, aculeifer, and, stratiolaelaps, scimitus, are, used, to, control, fungus, gnats, poultry, red, mites, and, various, soil, pests, mites, were, first, observed, under, the, microscope, by, the, english, polymath, robert, hooke, in, his, 1665, book, micrographia, he, stated, that, far, from, being, spontaneously, generated, from, dirt, they, were, very, prettily, shap, d, insects, in, 1898, arthur, conan, doyle, wrote, a, satirical, poem, a, parable, with, the, conceit, of, some, cheese, mites, disputing, the, origin, of, the, round, cheddar, cheese, in, which, they, all, lived, the, world, s, first, science, documentary, featured, cheese, mites, seen, under, the, microscope, the, short, film, was, shown, in, london, s, alhambra, music, hall, in, 1903, causing, a, boom, in, the, sales, of, simple, microscopes
