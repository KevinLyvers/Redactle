see, taxonomy, scorpions, are, predatory, arachnids, of, the, order, scorpiones, they, have, eight, legs, and, are, easily, recognized, by, a, pair, of, grasping, pincers, and, a, narrow, segmented, tail, often, carried, in, a, characteristic, forward, curve, over, the, back, and, always, ending, with, a, stinger, the, evolutionary, history, of, scorpions, goes, back, 435, million, years, they, mainly, live, in, deserts, but, have, adapted, to, a, wide, range, of, environmental, conditions, and, can, be, found, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, there, are, over, 2, 500, described, species, with, 22, extant, living, families, recognized, to, date, their, taxonomy, is, being, revised, to, account, for, 21st, century, genomic, studies, scorpions, primarily, prey, on, insects, and, other, invertebrates, but, some, species, hunt, vertebrates, they, use, their, pincers, to, restrain, and, kill, prey, or, to, prevent, their, own, predation, the, venomous, sting, is, used, for, offense, and, defense, during, courtship, the, male, and, female, grasp, each, other, s, pincers, and, dance, while, he, tries, to, move, her, onto, his, sperm, packet, all, known, species, give, live, birth, and, the, female, cares, for, the, young, as, their, exoskeletons, harden, transporting, them, on, her, back, the, exoskeleton, contains, fluorescent, chemicals, and, glows, under, ultraviolet, light, the, vast, majority, of, species, do, not, seriously, threaten, humans, and, healthy, adults, usually, do, not, need, medical, treatment, after, a, sting, about, 25, species, fewer, than, one, percent, have, venom, capable, of, killing, a, human, which, happens, frequently, in, the, parts, of, the, world, where, they, live, primarily, where, access, to, medical, treatment, is, unlikely, scorpions, appear, in, art, folklore, mythology, and, commercial, brands, scorpion, motifs, are, woven, into, kilim, carpets, for, protection, from, their, sting, scorpius, is, the, name, of, a, constellation, the, corresponding, astrological, sign, is, scorpio, a, classical, myth, about, scorpius, tells, how, the, giant, scorpion, and, its, enemy, orion, became, constellations, on, opposite, sides, of, the, sky, the, word, scorpion, originated, in, middle, english, between, 1175, and, 1225, ad, from, old, french, scorpion, or, from, italian, scorpione, both, derived, from, the, latin, scorpio, equivalent, to, scorpius, which, is, the, romanization, of, the, greek, skorp, os, with, no, native, ie, etymology, cfr, arabic, aqrab, scorpion, proto, germanic, krabb, crab, scorpion, fossils, have, been, found, in, many, strata, including, marine, silurian, and, estuarine, devonian, deposits, coal, deposits, from, the, carboniferous, period, and, in, amber, whether, the, early, scorpions, were, marine, or, terrestrial, has, been, debated, though, they, had, book, lungs, like, modern, terrestrial, species, over, 100, fossil, species, of, scorpion, have, been, described, the, oldest, found, as, of, 2021, is, dolichophonus, loudonensis, which, lived, during, the, silurian, in, present, day, scotland, gondwanascorpio, from, the, devonian, is, among, the, earliest, known, terrestrial, animals, on, the, gondwana, supercontinent, some, palaeozoic, scorpions, possessed, compound, eyes, similar, to, those, of, eurypterids, the, triassic, fossils, protochactas, and, protobuthus, belong, to, the, modern, clades, chactoidea, and, buthoidea, respectively, indicating, that, the, crown, group, of, modern, scorpions, had, emerged, by, this, time, the, scorpiones, are, a, clade, within, the, pulmonate, arachnida, those, with, book, lungs, arachnida, is, placed, within, the, chelicerata, a, subphylum, of, arthropoda, that, contains, sea, spiders, and, horseshoe, crabs, alongside, terrestrial, animals, without, book, lungs, such, as, ticks, and, harvestmen, the, extinct, eurypterida, sometimes, called, sea, scorpions, though, they, were, not, all, marine, are, not, scorpions, their, grasping, pincers, were, chelicerae, not, homologous, with, the, pincers, second, appendages, of, scorpions, scorpiones, is, sister, to, the, tetrapulmonata, a, terrestrial, group, of, pulmonates, containing, the, spiders, and, whip, scorpions, this, 2019, cladogram, summarizes, pycnogonida, sea, spiders, xiphosura, horseshoe, crabs, eurypterida, sea, scorpions, ticks, harvestmen, etc, araneae, spiders, pedipalpi, whip, scorpions, etc, recent, studies, place, pseudoscorpions, as, the, sister, group, of, scorpions, in, the, clade, panscorpiones, which, together, with, tetrapulmonata, makes, up, the, clade, arachnopulmonata, the, internal, phylogeny, of, the, scorpions, has, been, debated, but, genomic, analysis, consistently, places, the, bothriuridae, as, sister, to, a, clade, consisting, of, scorpionoidea, and, chactoidea, the, scorpions, diversified, between, the, devonian, and, the, early, carboniferous, the, main, division, is, into, the, clades, buthida, and, iurida, the, bothriuridae, diverged, starting, before, temperate, gondwana, broke, up, into, separate, land, masses, completed, by, the, jurassic, the, iuroidea, and, chactoidea, are, both, seen, not, to, be, single, clades, and, are, shown, as, paraphyletic, with, quotation, marks, in, this, 2018, cladogram, chaeriloidea, pseudochactoidea, buthoidea, iuroidea, part, bothriuroidea, chactoidea, part, iuroidea, part, chactoidea, part, scorpionoidea, carl, linnaeus, described, six, species, of, scorpion, in, his, genus, scorpio, in, 1758, and, 1767, three, of, these, are, now, considered, valid, and, are, called, scorpio, maurus, androctonus, australis, and, euscorpius, carpathicus, the, other, three, are, dubious, names, he, placed, the, scorpions, among, his, insecta, aptera, wingless, insects, a, group, that, included, crustacea, arachnida, and, myriapoda, in, 1801, jean, baptiste, lamarck, divided, up, the, insecta, aptera, creating, the, taxon, arachnides, for, spiders, scorpions, and, acari, mites, and, ticks, though, it, also, contained, the, thysanura, myriapoda, and, parasites, such, as, lice, german, arachnologist, carl, ludwig, koch, created, the, order, scorpiones, in, 1837, he, divided, it, into, four, families, the, six, eyed, scorpions, scorpionides, the, eight, eyed, scorpions, buthides, the, ten, eyed, scorpions, centrurides, and, the, twelve, eyed, scorpions, androctonides, more, recently, some, twenty, two, families, containing, over, 2, 500, species, of, scorpions, have, been, described, with, many, additions, and, much, reorganization, of, taxa, in, the, 21st, century, there, are, over, 100, described, taxa, of, fossil, scorpions, this, classification, is, based, on, soleglad, and, fet, 2003, which, replaced, stockwell, s, older, unpublished, classification, further, taxonomic, changes, are, from, papers, by, soleglad, et, al, 2005, the, extant, taxa, to, the, rank, of, family, numbers, of, species, in, parentheses, are, scorpions, are, found, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, the, diversity, of, scorpions, is, greatest, in, subtropical, areas, it, decreases, toward, the, poles, and, equator, though, scorpions, are, found, in, the, tropics, scorpions, did, not, occur, naturally, in, great, britain, but, were, accidentally, introduced, by, humans, and, have, now, established, a, population, new, zealand, and, some, of, the, islands, in, oceania, have, in, the, past, had, small, populations, of, introduced, scorpions, but, they, were, exterminated, five, colonies, of, euscorpius, flavicaudis, have, established, themselves, since, the, late, 19th, century, in, sheerness, in, england, at, 51, n, while, paruroctonus, boreus, lives, as, far, north, as, red, deer, alberta, at, 52, n, a, few, species, are, on, the, iucn, red, list, lychas, braueri, is, classed, as, critically, endangered, 2014, isometrus, deharvengi, as, endangered, 2016, and, chiromachus, ochropus, as, vulnerable, 2014, scorpions, are, xerocoles, meaning, they, primarily, live, in, deserts, but, they, can, be, found, in, virtually, every, terrestrial, habitat, including, high, elevation, mountains, caves, and, intertidal, zones, they, are, largely, absent, from, boreal, ecosystems, such, as, the, tundra, high, altitude, taiga, and, mountain, tops, the, highest, altitude, reached, by, a, scorpion, is, 5, 500, meters, 18, 000, ft, in, the, andes, for, orobothriurus, crassimanus, as, regards, microhabitats, scorpions, may, be, ground, dwelling, tree, loving, rock, loving, or, sand, loving, some, species, such, as, vaejovis, janssi, are, versatile, and, are, found, in, all, habitats, on, socorro, island, baja, california, while, others, such, as, euscorpius, carpathicus, endemic, to, the, littoral, zone, of, rivers, in, romania, occupy, specialized, niches, scorpions, range, in, size, from, the, 8, 5, mm, 0, 33, in, typhlochactas, mitchelli, of, typhlochactidae, to, the, 23, cm, 9, 1, in, heterometrus, swammerdami, of, scorpionidae, the, body, of, a, scorpion, is, divided, into, two, parts, or, tagmata, the, cephalothorax, or, prosoma, and, the, abdomen, or, opisthosoma, the, opisthosoma, is, subdivided, into, a, broad, anterior, portion, the, mesosoma, or, pre, abdomen, and, a, narrow, tail, like, posterior, the, metasoma, or, post, abdomen, external, differences, between, the, sexes, are, not, obvious, in, most, species, in, some, the, metasoma, is, more, elongated, in, males, than, females, the, cephalothorax, comprises, the, carapace, eyes, chelicerae, mouth, parts, pedipalps, which, have, chelae, commonly, called, claws, or, pincers, and, four, pairs, of, walking, legs, scorpions, have, two, eyes, on, the, top, of, the, cephalothorax, and, usually, two, to, five, pairs, of, eyes, along, the, front, corners, of, the, cephalothorax, while, unable, to, form, sharp, images, their, central, eyes, are, amongst, the, most, light, sensitive, in, the, animal, kingdom, especially, in, dim, light, which, makes, it, possible, for, nocturnal, species, to, use, starlight, to, navigate, at, night, the, chelicerae, are, at, the, front, and, underneath, the, carapace, they, are, pincer, like, and, have, three, segments, and, sharp, teeth, the, brain, of, a, scorpion, is, in, the, back, of, the, cephalothorax, just, above, the, esophagus, as, in, other, arachnids, the, nervous, system, is, highly, concentrated, in, the, cephalothorax, but, has, a, long, ventral, nerve, cord, with, segmented, ganglia, which, may, be, a, primitive, trait, the, pedipalp, is, a, segmented, clawed, appendage, used, for, prey, immobilization, defense, and, sensory, purposes, the, segments, of, the, pedipalp, from, closest, to, the, body, outward, are, coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, including, the, fixed, claw, and, the, manus, and, tarsus, moveable, claw, a, scorpion, has, darkened, or, granular, raised, linear, ridges, called, keels, or, carinae, on, the, pedipalp, segments, and, on, other, parts, of, the, body, these, are, useful, as, taxonomic, characters, unlike, those, of, some, other, arachnids, the, legs, have, not, been, modified, for, other, purposes, though, they, may, occasionally, be, used, for, digging, and, females, may, use, them, to, catch, emerging, young, the, legs, are, covered, in, proprioceptors, bristles, and, sensory, setae, depending, on, the, species, the, legs, may, have, spines, and, spurs, the, mesosoma, or, preabdomen, is, the, broad, part, of, the, opisthosoma, in, the, early, stages, of, embryonic, development, the, mesosoma, consist, of, eight, segments, but, the, first, segment, disappear, before, birth, so, the, mesosoma, in, scorpions, actually, consist, of, segments, 2, 8, these, anterior, seven, somites, segments, of, the, opisthosoma, are, each, covered, dorsally, by, a, sclerotized, plate, called, the, tergite, ventrally, somites, 3, to, 7, are, armored, with, matching, plates, called, sternites, the, ventral, side, of, somite, 1, has, a, pair, of, genital, opercula, covering, the, gonopore, sternite, 2, forms, the, basal, plate, bearing, the, pectines, which, function, as, sensory, organs, the, next, four, somites, 3, to, 6, all, bear, pairs, of, spiracles, they, serve, as, openings, for, the, scorpion, s, respiratory, organs, known, as, book, lungs, the, spiracle, openings, may, be, slits, circular, elliptical, or, oval, according, to, the, species, there, are, thus, four, pairs, of, book, lungs, each, consists, of, some, 140, to, 150, thin, lamellae, filled, with, air, inside, a, pulmonary, chamber, connected, on, the, ventral, side, to, an, atrial, chamber, which, opens, into, a, spiracle, bristles, hold, the, lamellae, apart, a, muscle, opens, the, spiracle, and, widens, the, atrial, chamber, dorsoventral, muscles, contract, to, compress, the, pulmonary, chamber, forcing, air, out, and, relax, to, allow, the, chamber, to, refill, the, 7th, and, last, somite, does, not, bear, appendages, or, any, other, significant, external, structures, the, mesosoma, contains, the, heart, or, dorsal, vessel, which, is, the, center, of, the, scorpion, s, open, circulatory, system, the, heart, is, continuous, with, a, deep, arterial, system, which, spreads, throughout, the, body, sinuses, return, deoxygenated, blood, hemolymph, to, the, heart, the, blood, is, re, oxygenated, by, cardiac, pores, the, mesosoma, also, contains, the, reproductive, system, the, female, gonads, are, made, of, three, or, four, tubes, that, run, parallel, to, each, other, and, are, connected, by, two, to, four, transverse, anastomoses, these, tubes, are, the, sites, for, both, oocyte, formation, and, embryonic, development, they, connect, to, two, oviducts, which, connect, to, a, single, atrium, leading, to, the, genital, orifice, males, have, two, gonads, made, of, two, cylindrical, tubes, with, a, ladder, like, configuration, they, contain, cysts, which, produce, spermatozoa, both, tubes, end, in, a, spermiduct, one, on, each, side, of, the, mesosoma, they, connect, to, glandular, symmetrical, structures, called, paraxial, organs, which, end, at, the, genital, orifice, these, secrete, chitin, based, structures, which, come, together, to, form, the, spermatophore, the, tail, or, metasoma, consists, of, five, segments, and, the, telson, which, is, not, strictly, a, segment, the, five, segments, are, merely, body, rings, they, lack, apparent, sterna, or, terga, and, become, larger, distally, these, segments, have, keels, setae, and, bristles, which, may, be, used, for, taxonomic, classification, the, anus, is, at, the, distal, and, ventral, end, of, the, last, segment, and, is, encircled, by, four, anal, papillae, and, the, anal, arch, the, tails, of, some, species, contain, light, receptors, the, telson, includes, the, vesicle, which, contains, a, symmetrical, pair, of, venom, glands, externally, it, bears, the, curved, stinger, the, hypodermic, aculeus, equipped, with, sensory, hairs, each, of, the, venom, glands, has, its, own, duct, to, convey, its, secretion, along, the, aculeus, from, the, bulb, of, the, gland, to, immediately, near, of, the, tip, where, each, of, the, paired, ducts, has, its, own, venom, pore, an, extrinsic, muscle, system, in, the, tail, moves, it, forward, and, propels, and, penetrates, with, the, aculeus, while, an, intrinsic, muscle, system, attached, to, the, glands, pumps, venom, through, the, stinger, into, the, intended, victim, the, stinger, contains, metalloproteins, with, zinc, hardening, the, tip, the, optimal, stinging, angle, is, around, 30, degrees, relative, to, the, tip, most, scorpion, species, are, nocturnal, or, crepuscular, finding, shelter, during, the, day, in, burrows, cracks, in, rocks, and, tree, bark, many, species, dig, a, shelter, underneath, stones, a, few, centimeters, long, some, may, use, burrows, made, by, other, animals, including, spiders, reptiles, and, small, mammals, other, species, dig, their, own, burrows, which, vary, in, complexity, and, depth, hadrurus, species, dig, burrows, as, over, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, deep, digging, is, done, using, the, mouth, parts, claws, and, legs, in, several, species, particularly, of, the, family, buthidae, individuals, may, gather, in, the, same, shelter, bark, scorpions, may, aggregate, up, to, 30, individuals, in, some, species, families, of, females, and, young, sometimes, aggregate, scorpions, prefer, areas, where, the, temperature, remains, in, the, range, of, 11, 40, c, 52, 104, f, but, may, survive, temperatures, from, well, below, freezing, to, desert, heat, scorpions, can, withstand, intense, heat, leiurus, quinquestriatus, scorpio, maurus, and, hadrurus, arizonensis, can, live, in, temperatures, of, 45, 50, c, 113, 122, f, if, they, are, sufficiently, hydrated, desert, species, must, deal, with, the, extreme, changes, in, temperature, from, day, to, night, or, between, seasons, pectinibuthus, birulai, lives, in, a, temperature, range, of, 30, 50, c, 22, 122, f, scorpions, that, live, outside, deserts, prefer, lower, temperatures, the, ability, to, resist, cold, may, be, related, to, the, increase, in, the, sugar, trehalose, when, the, temperature, drops, some, species, hibernate, scorpions, appear, to, have, resistance, to, ionizing, radiation, this, was, discovered, in, the, early, 1960s, when, scorpions, were, found, to, be, among, the, few, animals, to, survive, nuclear, tests, at, reggane, algeria, desert, scorpions, have, several, adaptations, for, water, conservation, they, excrete, insoluble, compounds, such, as, xanthine, guanine, and, uric, acid, not, requiring, water, for, their, removal, from, the, body, guanine, is, the, main, component, and, maximizes, the, amount, of, nitrogen, excreted, a, scorpion, s, cuticle, holds, in, moisture, via, lipids, and, waxes, from, epidermal, glands, and, protects, against, ultraviolet, radiation, even, when, dehydrated, a, scorpion, can, tolerate, high, osmotic, pressure, in, its, blood, desert, scorpions, get, most, of, their, moisture, from, the, food, they, eat, but, some, can, absorb, water, from, the, humid, soil, species, that, live, in, denser, vegetation, and, in, more, moderate, temperatures, will, drink, water, on, plants, and, in, puddles, a, scorpion, uses, its, stinger, both, for, killing, prey, and, defense, some, species, make, direct, quick, strikes, with, their, tails, while, others, make, slower, more, circular, strikes, which, can, more, easily, return, the, stinger, to, a, position, where, it, can, strike, again, leiurus, quinquestriatus, can, whip, its, tail, at, a, speed, of, up, to, 128, cm, s, 50, in, s, in, a, defensive, strike, scorpions, may, be, attacked, by, other, arthropods, like, ants, spiders, solifugids, and, centipedes, major, predators, include, frogs, lizards, snakes, birds, and, mammals, meerkats, are, somewhat, specialized, in, preying, on, scorpions, biting, off, their, stingers, and, being, immune, to, their, venom, other, predators, adapted, for, hunting, scorpions, include, the, grasshopper, mouse, and, desert, long, eared, bat, which, are, also, immune, to, their, venom, in, one, study, 70, of, the, latter, s, droppings, contained, scorpion, fragments, scorpions, host, parasites, including, mites, scuttle, flies, nematodes, and, some, bacteria, the, immune, system, of, scorpions, gives, them, resistance, to, infection, by, many, types, of, bacteria, when, threatened, a, scorpion, raises, its, claws, and, tail, in, a, defensive, posture, some, species, stridulate, to, warn, off, predators, by, rubbing, certain, hairs, the, stinger, or, the, claws, certain, species, have, a, preference, for, using, either, the, claws, or, stinger, as, defense, depending, on, the, size, of, the, appendages, a, few, scorpions, such, as, parabuthus, centruroides, margaritatus, and, hadrurus, arizonensis, squirt, venom, in, a, narrow, jet, as, far, as, 1, meter, 3, 3, ft, to, warn, off, potential, predators, possibly, injuring, them, in, the, eyes, some, ananteris, species, can, shed, parts, of, their, tail, to, escape, predators, the, parts, do, not, grow, back, leaving, them, unable, to, sting, and, defecate, but, they, can, still, catch, small, prey, and, reproduce, for, at, least, eight, months, afterward, scorpions, generally, prey, on, insects, particularly, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, beetles, and, wasps, other, prey, include, spiders, solifugids, woodlice, and, even, small, vertebrates, including, lizards, snakes, and, mammals, species, with, large, claws, may, prey, on, earthworms, and, mollusks, the, majority, of, species, are, opportunistic, and, consume, a, variety, of, prey, though, some, may, be, highly, specialized, isometroides, vescus, specializes, on, burrowing, spiders, prey, size, depends, on, the, size, of, the, species, several, scorpion, species, are, sit, and, wait, predators, which, involves, them, waiting, for, prey, at, or, near, the, entrance, to, their, burrow, others, actively, seek, them, out, scorpions, detect, their, prey, with, mechanoreceptive, and, chemoreceptive, hairs, on, their, bodies, and, capture, them, with, their, claws, small, animals, are, merely, killed, with, the, claws, particularly, by, large, clawed, species, larger, and, more, aggressive, prey, is, given, a, sting, scorpions, like, other, arachnids, digest, their, food, externally, the, chelicerae, which, are, very, sharp, are, used, to, pull, small, amounts, of, food, off, the, prey, item, into, a, pre, oral, cavity, below, the, chelicerae, and, carapace, the, digestive, juices, from, the, gut, are, egested, onto, the, food, and, the, digested, food, is, then, sucked, into, the, gut, in, liquid, form, any, solid, indigestible, matter, such, as, exoskeleton, fragments, is, trapped, by, setae, in, the, pre, oral, cavity, and, ejected, the, sucked, in, food, is, pumped, into, the, midgut, by, the, pharynx, where, it, is, further, digested, the, waste, passes, through, the, hindgut, and, out, of, the, anus, scorpions, can, consume, large, amounts, of, food, during, one, meal, they, have, an, efficient, food, storage, organ, and, a, very, low, metabolic, rate, and, a, relatively, inactive, lifestyle, this, enables, some, to, survive, six, to, twelve, months, of, starvation, most, scorpions, reproduce, sexually, with, male, and, female, individuals, species, in, some, genera, such, as, hottentotta, and, tityus, and, the, species, centruroides, gracilis, liocheles, australasiae, and, ananteris, coineaui, have, been, reported, not, necessarily, reliably, to, reproduce, through, parthenogenesis, in, which, unfertilized, eggs, develop, into, living, embryos, receptive, females, produce, pheromones, which, are, picked, up, by, wandering, males, using, their, pectines, to, comb, the, substrate, males, begin, courtship, by, moving, their, bodies, back, and, forth, without, moving, the, legs, a, behavior, known, as, juddering, this, appears, to, produce, ground, vibrations, that, are, picked, up, by, the, female, the, pair, then, make, contact, using, their, pedipalps, and, perform, a, dance, called, the, promenade, deux, french, for, a, walk, for, two, in, this, dance, the, male, and, female, move, back, and, forth, while, facing, each, other, as, the, male, searches, for, a, suitable, place, to, deposit, his, spermatophore, the, courtship, ritual, can, involve, several, other, behaviors, such, as, a, cheliceral, kiss, in, which, the, male, and, female, grasp, each, other, s, mouth, parts, arbre, droit, upright, tree, where, the, partners, elevate, their, posteriors, and, rub, their, tails, together, and, sexual, stinging, in, which, the, male, stings, the, female, in, the, chelae, or, mesosoma, to, subdue, her, the, dance, can, last, from, a, few, minutes, to, several, hours, when, the, male, has, located, a, suitably, stable, substrate, such, as, hard, ground, agglomerated, sand, rock, or, tree, bark, he, deposits, the, spermatophore, and, guides, the, female, over, it, this, allows, the, spermatophore, to, enter, her, genital, opercula, which, triggers, release, of, the, sperm, thus, fertilizing, the, female, a, mating, plug, then, forms, in, the, female, to, prevent, her, from, mating, again, before, the, young, are, born, the, male, and, female, then, abruptly, separate, sexual, cannibalism, after, mating, has, only, been, reported, anecdotally, in, scorpions, gestation, in, scorpions, can, last, for, over, a, year, in, some, species, they, have, two, types, of, embryonic, development, apoikogenic, and, katoikogenic, in, the, apoikogenic, system, which, is, mainly, found, in, the, buthidae, embryos, develop, in, yolk, rich, eggs, inside, follicles, the, katoikogenic, system, is, documented, in, hemiscorpiidae, scorpionidae, and, diplocentridae, and, involves, the, embryos, developing, in, a, diverticulum, which, has, a, teat, like, structure, for, them, to, feed, through, unlike, the, majority, of, arachnids, which, are, oviparous, hatching, from, eggs, scorpions, seem, to, be, universally, viviparous, with, live, births, they, are, unusual, among, terrestrial, arthropods, in, the, amount, of, care, a, female, gives, to, her, offspring, the, size, of, a, brood, varies, by, species, from, 3, to, over, 100, the, body, size, of, scorpions, is, not, correlated, either, with, brood, size, or, with, life, cycle, length, before, giving, birth, the, female, elevates, the, front, of, her, body, and, positions, her, pedipalps, and, front, legs, under, her, to, catch, the, young, birth, basket, the, young, emerge, one, by, one, from, the, genital, opercula, expel, the, embryonic, membrane, if, any, and, are, placed, on, the, mother, s, back, where, they, remain, until, they, have, gone, through, at, least, one, molt, the, period, before, the, first, molt, is, called, the, pro, juvenile, stage, the, young, are, unable, to, feed, or, sting, but, have, suckers, on, their, tarsi, used, to, hold, on, to, their, mother, this, period, lasts, 5, to, 25, days, depending, on, the, species, the, brood, molt, for, the, first, time, simultaneously, in, a, process, that, lasts, 6, to, 8, hours, marking, the, beginning, of, the, juvenile, stage, juvenile, stages, or, instars, generally, resemble, smaller, versions, of, adults, with, fully, developed, pincers, hairs, and, stingers, they, are, still, soft, and, lack, pigments, and, thus, continue, to, ride, on, their, mother, s, back, for, protection, they, become, harder, and, more, pigmented, over, the, next, couple, of, days, they, may, leave, their, mother, temporarily, returning, when, they, sense, potential, danger, once, the, exoskeleton, is, fully, hardened, the, young, can, hunt, prey, on, their, own, and, may, soon, leave, their, mother, a, scorpion, may, molt, six, times, on, average, before, reaching, maturity, which, may, not, occur, until, it, is, 6, to, 83, months, old, depending, on, the, species, some, species, may, live, up, to, 25, years, scorpions, glow, a, vibrant, blue, green, when, exposed, to, certain, wavelengths, of, ultraviolet, light, such, as, that, produced, by, a, black, light, due, to, fluorescent, chemicals, such, as, beta, carboline, in, the, cuticle, accordingly, a, hand, held, ultraviolet, lamp, has, long, been, a, standard, tool, for, nocturnal, field, surveys, of, these, animals, fluorescence, occurs, as, a, result, of, sclerotization, and, increases, in, intensity, with, each, successive, instar, this, fluorescence, may, have, an, active, role, in, the, scorpion, s, ability, to, detect, light, scorpion, venom, serves, to, kill, or, paralyze, prey, rapidly, the, stings, of, many, species, are, uncomfortable, but, only, 25, species, have, venom, that, is, deadly, to, humans, those, species, belong, to, the, family, buthidae, including, leiurus, quinquestriatus, hottentotta, spp, centruroides, spp, and, androctonus, spp, people, with, allergies, are, especially, at, risk, otherwise, first, aid, is, symptomatic, with, analgesia, cases, of, very, high, blood, pressure, are, treated, with, medications, that, relieve, anxiety, and, relax, the, blood, vessels, scorpion, envenomation, with, high, morbidity, and, mortality, is, usually, due, to, either, excessive, autonomic, activity, and, cardiovascular, toxic, effects, or, neuromuscular, toxic, effects, antivenom, is, the, specific, treatment, for, scorpion, envenomation, combined, with, supportive, measures, including, vasodilators, in, patients, with, cardiovascular, toxic, effects, and, benzodiazepines, when, there, is, neuromuscular, involvement, although, rare, severe, hypersensitivity, reactions, including, anaphylaxis, to, scorpion, antivenin, are, possible, scorpion, stings, are, a, public, health, problem, particularly, in, the, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, of, the, americas, north, africa, the, middle, east, and, india, around, 1, 5, million, scorpion, envenomations, occur, each, year, with, around, 2, 600, deaths, mexico, is, one, of, the, most, affected, countries, with, the, highest, biodiversity, of, scorpions, in, the, world, some, 200, 000, envenomations, per, year, and, at, least, 300, deaths, efforts, are, made, to, prevent, envenomation, and, to, control, scorpion, populations, prevention, encompasses, personal, activities, such, as, checking, shoes, and, clothes, before, putting, them, on, not, walking, in, bare, feet, or, sandals, and, filling, in, holes, and, cracks, where, scorpions, might, nest, street, lighting, reduces, scorpion, activity, control, may, involve, the, use, of, insecticides, such, as, pyrethroids, or, gathering, scorpions, manually, with, the, help, of, ultraviolet, lights, domestic, predators, of, scorpions, such, as, chickens, and, turkeys, can, help, to, reduce, the, risk, to, a, household, scorpion, venom, is, a, mixture, of, neurotoxins, most, of, these, are, peptides, chains, of, amino, acids, many, of, them, interfere, with, membrane, channels, that, transport, sodium, potassium, calcium, or, chloride, ions, these, channels, are, essential, for, nerve, conduction, muscle, contraction, and, many, other, biological, processes, some, of, these, molecules, may, be, useful, in, medical, research, and, might, lead, to, the, development, of, new, disease, treatments, among, their, potential, therapeutic, uses, are, as, analgesic, anti, cancer, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, bradykinin, potentiating, and, immunosuppressive, drugs, as, of, 2020, no, scorpion, toxin, based, drug, is, for, sale, though, chlorotoxin, is, being, trialled, for, use, against, glioma, a, brain, cancer, scorpions, are, eaten, by, people, in, west, africa,

often, kept, as, pets, they, are, relatively, simple, to, keep, the, main, requirements, being, a, secure, enclosure, such, as, a, glass, terrarium, with, a, lockable, lid, and, the, appropriate, temperature, and, humidity, for, the, chosen, species, which, typically, means, installing, a, heating, mat, and, spraying, regularly, with, a, little, water, the, substrate, needs, to, resemble, that, of, the, species, natural, environment, such, as, peat, for, forest, species, or, lateritic, sand, for, burrowing, desert, species, scorpions, in, the, genera, pandinus, and, heterometrus, are, docile, enough, to, handle, a, large, pandinus, may, consume, up, to, three, crickets, each, week, cannibalism, is, more, common, in, captivity, than, in, the, wild, and, can, be, minimized, by, providing, many, small, shelters, within, the, enclosure, and, ensuring, there, is, plenty, of, prey, the, pet, trade, has, threatened, wild, populations, of, some, scorpion, species, particularly,
