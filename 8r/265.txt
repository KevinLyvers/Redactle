fermentation, is, a, type, of, redox, metabolism, carried, out, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, during, fermentation, organic, molecules, e, g, glucose, are, catabolized, and, donate, electrons, to, other, organic, molecules, in, the, process, atp, and, organic, end, products, e, g, lactate, are, formed, because, oxygen, is, not, required, it, is, an, alternative, to, aerobic, respiration, over, 25, of, bacteria, and, archaea, carry, out, fermentation, and, they, live, in, the, gut, sediments, food, and, other, environments, eukaryotes, including, humans, and, other, animals, also, carry, out, fermentation, fermentation, is, important, in, several, areas, of, human, society, humans, have, used, fermentation, in, production, of, food, for, 13, 000, years, humans, and, their, livestock, have, microbes, in, the, gut, that, carry, out, fermentation, releasing, products, used, by, the, host, for, energy, fermentation, is, used, at, an, industrial, level, to, produce, commodity, chemicals, such, as, ethanol, and, lactate, in, total, fermentation, forms, more, than, 50, metabolic, end, products, with, a, wide, range, of, uses, the, definition, of, fermentation, has, evolved, over, the, years, the, most, modern, definition, is, catabolism, where, organic, compounds, are, both, the, electron, donor, and, acceptor, a, common, electron, donor, is, glucose, and, pyruvate, is, a, common, electron, acceptor, this, definition, distinguishes, fermentation, from, aerobic, respiration, where, oxygen, is, the, acceptor, and, types, of, anaerobic, respiration, where, inorganic, compound, is, the, acceptor, fermentation, had, been, defined, differently, in, the, past, in, 1876, louis, pasteur, defined, it, as, la, vie, sans, air, life, without, air, this, definition, came, before, the, discovery, of, anaerobic, respiration, later, it, had, been, defined, as, catabolism, that, forms, atp, through, only, substrate, level, phosphorylation, however, several, pathways, of, fermentation, have, been, discovered, to, form, atp, through, an, electron, transport, chain, and, atp, synthase, also, some, sources, define, fermentation, loosely, as, any, large, scale, biological, manufacturing, process, see, industrial, fermentation, this, definition, focuses, on, the, process, of, manufacturing, rather, than, metabolic, details, fermentation, is, used, by, organisms, to, generate, atp, energy, for, metabolism, one, advantage, is, that, it, requires, no, oxygen, or, other, external, electron, acceptors, and, thus, it, can, be, carried, when, those, electron, acceptors, are, absent, a, disadvantage, is, that, it, produces, relatively, little, atp, yielding, only, between, 2, to, 4, 5, per, glucose, compared, to, 32, for, aerobic, respiration, over, 25, of, bacteria, and, archaea, carry, out, fermentation, this, type, of, metabolism, is, most, common, in, the, phylum, bacillota, and, it, is, least, common, in, actinomycetota, their, most, common, habitat, is, host, associated, ones, such, as, the, gut, animals, including, humans, also, carry, out, fermentation, the, product, of, fermentation, in, humans, is, lactate, and, it, is, formed, during, anaerobic, exercise, or, in, cancerous, cells, no, animal, is, known, to, survive, on, fermentation, alone, even, as, one, parasitic, animal, henneguya, zschokkei, is, known, to, survive, without, oxygen, fermentation, uses, a, range, of, substrates, and, forms, a, variety, of, metabolic, end, products, of, the, 55, end, products, formed, the, most, common, are, acetate, and, lactate, of, the, 46, chemically, defined, substrates, that, have, been, reported, the, most, common, are, glucose, and, other, sugars, when, an, organic, compound, is, fermented, it, is, broken, down, to, a, simpler, molecule, and, releases, electrons, the, electrons, are, transferred, to, a, redox, cofactor, which, in, turn, transfers, them, to, an, organic, compound, atp, is, generated, in, the, process, and, it, can, be, formed, by, substrate, level, phosphorylation, or, by, atp, synthase, when, glucose, is, fermented, it, enters, glycolysis, or, the, pentose, phosphate, pathway, and, is, converted, to, pyruvate, from, pyruvate, pathways, branch, out, to, form, a, number, of, end, products, e, g, lactate, at, several, points, electrons, are, released, and, accepted, by, redox, cofactors, nad, and, ferredoxin, at, later, points, these, cofactors, donate, electrons, to, their, final, acceptor, and, become, oxidized, atp, is, also, formed, at, several, points, in, the, pathway, while, fermentation, is, simple, in, overview, its, details, are, more, complex, across, organisms, fermentation, of, glucose, involves, over, 120, different, biochemical, reactions, further, multiple, pathways, can, be, responsible, for, forming, the, same, product, for, forming, acetate, from, its, immediate, precursor, pyruvate, or, acetyl, coa, six, separate, pathways, have, been, found, in, ethanol, fermentation, one, glucose, molecule, is, converted, into, two, ethanol, molecules, and, two, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, molecules, it, is, used, to, make, bread, dough, rise, the, carbon, dioxide, forms, bubbles, expanding, the, dough, into, a, foam, the, ethanol, is, the, intoxicating, agent, in, alcoholic, beverages, such, as, wine, beer, and, liquor, fermentation, of, feedstocks, including, sugarcane, maize, and, sugar, beets, produces, ethanol, that, is, added, to, gasoline, in, some, species, of, fish, including, goldfish, and, carp, it, provides, energy, when, oxygen, is, scarce, along, with, lactic, acid, fermentation, before, fermentation, a, glucose, molecule, breaks, down, into, two, pyruvate, molecules, glycolysis, the, energy, from, this, exothermic, reaction, is, used, to, bind, inorganic, phosphates, to, adp, which, converts, it, to, atp, and, convert, nad, to, nadh, the, pyruvates, break, down, into, two, acetaldehyde, molecules, and, give, off, two, carbon, dioxide, molecules, as, waste, products, the, acetaldehyde, is, reduced, into, ethanol, using, the, energy, and, hydrogen, from, nadh, and, the, nadh, is, oxidized, into, nad, so, that, the, cycle, may, repeat, the, reaction, is, catalyzed, by, the, enzymes, pyruvate, decarboxylase, and, alcohol, dehydrogenase, the, history, of, ethanol, as, a, fuel, spans, several, centuries, and, is, marked, by, a, series, of, significant, milestones, samuel, morey, an, american, inventor, was, the, first, to, produce, ethanol, by, fermenting, corn, in, 1826, however, it, was, not, until, the, california, gold, rush, in, the, 1850s, that, ethanol, was, first, used, as, a, fuel, in, the, united, states, rudolf, diesel, demonstrated, his, engine, which, could, run, on, vegetable, oils, and, ethanol, in, 1895, but, the, widespread, use, of, petroleum, based, diesel, engines, made, ethanol, less, popular, as, a, fuel, in, the, 1970s, the, oil, crisis, reignited, interest, in, ethanol, and, brazil, became, a, leader, in, ethanol, production, and, use, the, united, states, began, producing, ethanol, on, a, large, scale, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, as, a, fuel, additive, to, gasoline, due, to, government, regulations, today, ethanol, continues, to, be, explored, as, a, sustainable, and, renewable, fuel, source, with, researchers, developing, new, technologies, and, biomass, sources, for, its, production, homolactic, fermentation, producing, only, lactic, acid, is, the, simplest, type, of, fermentation, pyruvate, from, glycolysis, undergoes, a, simple, redox, reaction, forming, lactic, acid, overall, one, molecule, of, glucose, or, any, six, carbon, sugar, is, converted, to, two, molecules, of, lactic, acid, it, occurs, in, the, muscles, of, animals, when, they, need, energy, faster, than, the, blood, can, supply, oxygen, it, also, occurs, in, some, kinds, of, bacteria, such, as, lactobacilli, and, some, fungi, it, is, the, type, of, bacteria, that, convert, lactose, into, lactic, acid, in, yogurt, giving, it, its, sour, taste, these, lactic, acid, bacteria, can, carry, out, either, homolactic, fermentation, where, the, end, product, is, mostly, lactic, acid, or, heterolactic, fermentation, where, some, lactate, is, further, metabolized, to, ethanol, and, carbon, dioxide, via, the, phosphoketolase, pathway, acetate, or, other, metabolic, products, e, g, if, lactose, is, fermented, as, in, yogurts, and, cheeses, it, is, first, converted, into, glucose, and, galactose, both, six, carbon, sugars, with, the, same, atomic, formula, heterolactic, fermentation, is, in, a, sense, intermediate, between, lactic, acid, fermentation, and, other, types, e, g, alcoholic, fermentation, reasons, to, go, further, and, convert, lactic, acid, into, something, else, include, hydrogen, gas, is, produced, in, many, types, of, fermentation, as, a, way, to, regenerate, nad, from, nadh, electrons, are, transferred, to, ferredoxin, which, in, turn, is, oxidized, by, hydrogenase, producing, h, 2, hydrogen, gas, is, a, substrate, for, methanogens, and, sulfate, reducers, which, keep, the, concentration, of, hydrogen, low, and, favor, the, production, of, such, an, energy, rich, compound, but, hydrogen, gas, at, a, fairly, high, concentration, can, nevertheless, be, formed, as, in, flatus, for, example, clostridium, pasteurianum, ferments, glucose, to, butyrate, acetate, carbon, dioxide, and, hydrogen, gas, the, reaction, leading, to, acetate, is, other, types, of, fermentation, include, mixed, acid, fermentation, butanediol, fermentation, butyrate, fermentation, caproate, fermentation, acetone, butanol, ethanol, fermentation, and, glyoxylate, fermentation, in, food, and, industrial, contexts, any, chemical, modification, performed, by, a, living, being, in, a, controlled, container, can, be, termed, fermentation, the, following, do, not, fall, into, the, biochemical, sense, but, are, called, fermentation, in, the, larger, sense, fermentation, can, be, used, to, make, alternative, protein, sources, it, is, commonly, used, to, modify, existing, protein, foods, including, plant, based, ones, such, as, soy, into, more, flavorful, forms, such, as, tempeh, and, fermented, tofu, more, modern, fermentation, makes, recombinant, protein, to, help, produce, meat, analogue, milk, substitute, cheese, analogues, and, egg, substitutes, some, examples, are, heme, proteins, such, as, myoglobin, and, hemoglobin, give, meat, its, characteristic, texture, flavor, color, and, aroma, the, myoglobin, and, leghemoglobin, ingredients, can, be, used, to, replicate, this, property, despite, them, coming, from, a, vat, instead, of, meat, industrial, fermentation, can, be, used, for, enzyme, production, where, proteins, with, catalytic, activity, are, produced, and, secreted, by, microorganisms, the, development, of, fermentation, processes, microbial, strain, engineering, and, recombinant, gene, technologies, has, enabled, the, commercialization, of, a, wide, range, of, enzymes, enzymes, are, used, in, all, kinds, of, industrial, segments, such, as, food, lactose, removal, cheese, flavor, beverage, juice, treatment, baking, bread, softness, dough, conditioning, animal, feed, detergents, protein, starch, and, lipid, stain, removal, textile, personal, care, and, pulp, and, paper, industries, most, industrial, fermentation, uses, batch, or, fed, batch, procedures, although, continuous, fermentation, can, be, more, economical, if, various, challenges, particularly, the, difficulty, of, maintaining, sterility, can, be, met, in, a, batch, process, all, the, ingredients, are, combined, and, the, reactions, proceed, without, any, further, input, batch, fermentation, has, been, used, for, millennia, to, make, bread, and, alcoholic, beverages, and, it, is, still, a, common, method, especially, when, the, process, is, not, well, understood, 1, however, it, can, be, expensive, because, the, fermentor, must, be, sterilized, using, high, pressure, steam, between, batches, strictly, speaking, there, is, often, addition, of, small, quantities, of, chemicals, to, control, the, ph, or, suppress, foaming, 25, batch, fermentation, goes, through, a, series, of, phases, there, is, a, lag, phase, in, which, cells, adjust, to, their, environment, then, a, phase, in, which, exponential, growth, occurs, once, many, of, the, nutrients, have, been, consumed, the, growth, slows, and, becomes, non, exponential, but, production, of, secondary, metabolites, including, commercially, important, antibiotics, and, enzymes, accelerates, this, continues, through, a, stationary, phase, after, most, of, the, nutrients, have, been, consumed, and, then, the, cells, die, 25, fed, batch, fermentation, is, a, variation, of, batch, fermentation, where, some, of, the, ingredients, are, added, during, the, fermentation, this, allows, greater, control, over, the, stages, of, the, process, in, particular, production, of, secondary, metabolites, can, be, increased, by, adding, a, limited, quantity, of, nutrients, during, the, non, exponential, growth, phase, fed, batch, operations, are, often, sandwiched, between, batch, operations, 1, the, high, cost, of, sterilizing, the, fermentor, between, batches, can, be, avoided, using, various, open, fermentation, approaches, that, are, able, to, resist, contamination, one, is, to, use, a, naturally, evolved, mixed, culture, this, is, particularly, favored, in, wastewater, treatment, since, mixed, populations, can, adapt, to, a, wide, variety, of, wastes, thermophilic, bacteria, can, produce, lactic, acid, at, temperatures, of, around, 50, celsius, sufficient, to, discourage, microbial, contamination, and, ethanol, has, been, produced, at, a, temperature, of, 70, c, this, is, just, below, its, boiling, point, 78, c, making, it, easy, to, extract, halophilic, bacteria, can, produce, bioplastics, in, hypersaline, conditions, solid, state, fermentation, adds, a, small, amount, of, water, to, a, solid, substrate, it, is, widely, used, in, the, food, industry, to, produce, flavors, enzymes, and, organic, acids, in, continuous, fermentation, substrates, are, added, and, final, products, removed, continuously, there, are, three, varieties, chemostats, which, hold, nutrient, levels, constant, turbidostats, which, keep, cell, mass, constant, and, plug, flow, reactors, in, which, the, culture, medium, flows, steadily, through, a, tube, while, the, cells, are, recycled, from, the, outlet, to, the, inlet, if, the, process, works, well, there, is, a, steady, flow, of, feed, and, effluent, and, the, costs, of, repeatedly, setting, up, a, batch, are, avoided, also, it, can, prolong, the, exponential, growth, phase, and, avoid, byproducts, that, inhibit, the, reactions, by, continuously, removing, them, however, it, is, difficult, to, maintain, a, steady, state, and, avoid, contamination, and, the, design, tends, to, be, complex, typically, the, fermentor, must, run, for, over, 500, hours, to, be, more, economical, than, batch, processors, the, use, of, fermentation, particularly, for, beverages, has, existed, since, the, neolithic, and, has, been, documented, dating, from, 7000, to, 6600, bce, in, jiahu, china, 5000, bce, in, india, ayurveda, mentions, many, medicated, wines, 6000, bce, in, georgia, 3150, bce, in, ancient, egypt, 3000, bce, in, babylon, 2000, bce, in, pre, hispanic, mexico, and, 1500, bc, in, sudan, fermented, foods, have, a, religious, significance, in, judaism, and, christianity, the, baltic, god, rugutis, was, worshiped, as, the, agent, of, fermentation, in, alchemy, fermentation, putrefaction, was, symbolized, by, capricorn, in, 1837, charles, cagniard, de, la, tour, theodor, schwann, and, friedrich, traugott, k, tzing, independently, published, papers, concluding, as, a, result, of, microscopic, investigations, that, yeast, is, a, living, organism, that, reproduces, by, budding, 6, schwann, boiled, grape, juice, to, kill, the, yeast, and, found, that, no, fermentation, would, occur, until, new, yeast, was, added, however, a, lot, of, chemists, including, antoine, lavoisier, continued, to, view, fermentation, as, a, simple, chemical, reaction, and, rejected, the, notion, that, living, organisms, could, be, involved, this, was, seen, as, a, reversion, to, vitalism, and, was, lampooned, in, an, anonymous, publication, by, justus, von, liebig, and, friedrich, w, hler, 108, 109, the, turning, point, came, when, louis, pasteur, 1822, 1895, during, the, 1850s, and, 1860s, repeated, schwann, s, experiments, and, showed, fermentation, is, initiated, by, living, organisms, in, a, series, of, investigations, 6, in, 1857, pasteur, showed, lactic, acid, fermentation, is, caused, by, living, organisms, in, 1860, he, demonstrated, how, bacteria, cause, souring, in, milk, a, process, formerly, thought, to, be, merely, a, chemical, change, his, work, in, identifying, the, role, of, microorganisms, in, food, spoilage, led, to, the, process, of, pasteurization, in, 1877, working, to, improve, the, french, brewing, industry, pasteur, published, his, famous, paper, on, fermentation, etudes, sur, la, bi, re, which, was, translated, into, english, in, 1879, as, studies, on, fermentation, he, defined, fermentation, incorrectly, as, life, without, air, yet, he, correctly, showed, how, specific, types, of, microorganisms, cause, specific, types, of, fermentations, and, specific, end, products, although, showing, fermentation, resulted, from, the, action, of, living, microorganisms, was, a, breakthrough, it, did, not, explain, the, basic, nature, of, fermentation, nor, did, it, prove, it, is, caused, by, microorganisms, which, appear, to, be, always, present, many, scientists, including, pasteur, had, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, extract, the, fermentation, enzyme, from, yeast, success, came, in, 1897, when, the, german, chemist, eduard, buechner, ground, up, yeast, extracted, a, juice, from, them, then, found, to, his, amazement, this, dead, liquid, would, ferment, a, sugar, solution, forming, carbon, dioxide, and, alcohol, much, like, living, yeasts, buechner, s, results, are, considered, to, mark, the, birth, of, biochemistry, the, unorganized, ferments, behaved, just, like, the, organized, ones, from, that, time, on, the, term, enzyme, came, to, be, applied, to, all, ferments, it, was, then, understood, fermentation, is, caused, by, enzymes, produced, by, microorganisms, in, 1907, buechner, won, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, work, advances, in, microbiology, and, fermentation, technology, have, continued, steadily, up, until, the, present, for, example, in, the, 1930s, it, was, discovered, microorganisms, could, be, mutated, with, physical, and, chemical, treatments, to, be, higher, yielding, faster, growing, tolerant, of, less, oxygen, and, able, to, use, a, more, concentrated, medium, strain, selection, and, hybridization, developed, as, well, affecting, most, modern, food, fermentations, the, field, of, fermentation, has, been, critical, to, the, production, of, a, wide, range, of, consumer, goods, from, food, and, drink, to, industrial, chemicals, and, pharmaceuticals, since, its, early, beginnings, in, ancient, civilizations, the, use, of, fermentation, has, continued, to, evolve, and, expand, with, new, techniques, and, technologies, driving, advances, in, product, quality, yield, and, efficiency, the, period, from, the, 1930s, onward, saw, a, number, of, significant, advancements, in, fermentation, technology, including, the, development, of, new, processes, for, producing, high, value, products, like, antibiotics, and, enzymes, the, increasing, importance, of, fermentation, in, the, production, of, bulk, chemicals, and, a, growing, interest, in, the, use, of, fermentation, for, the, production, of, functional, foods, and, nutraceuticals, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, saw, the, development, of, new, fermentation, technologies, such, as, the, use, of, immobilized, cells, and, enzymes, which, allowed, for, more, precise, control, over, fermentation, processes, and, increased, the, production, of, high, value, products, like, antibiotics, and, enzymes, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, fermentation, became, increasingly, important, in, the, production, of, bulk, chemicals, like, ethanol, lactic, acid, and, citric, acid, this, led, to, the, development, of, new, fermentation, techniques, and, the, use, of, genetically, engineered, microorganisms, to, improve, yields, and, reduce, production, costs, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, there, was, a, growing, interest, in, the, use, of, fermentation, for, the, production, of, functional, foods, and, nutraceuticals, which, have, potential, health, benefits, beyond, basic, nutrition, this, led, to, the, development, of, new, fermentation, processes, and, the, use, of, probiotics, and, other, functional, ingredients, overall, the, period, from, 1930, onward, saw, significant, advancements, in, the, use, of, fermentation, for, industrial, purposes, leading, to, the, production, of, a, wide, range, of, fermented, products, that, are, now, consumed, around, the, world
