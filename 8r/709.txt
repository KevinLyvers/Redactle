rheas, r, i, z, ree, z, also, known, as, andus, nj, n, d, u, z, nyan, dooz, or, south, american, ostrich, are, moderately, sized, south, american, ratites, flightless, birds, without, a, keel, on, their, sternum, bone, of, the, order, rheiformes, they, are, distantly, related, to, the, african, ostriches, and, australia, s, emu, the, largest, and, second, largest, living, ratites, respectively, with, rheas, placing, just, behind, the, emu, in, height, and, overall, size, most, taxonomic, authorities, recognize, two, extant, species, the, greater, or, american, rhea, rhea, americana, and, the, lesser, or, darwin, s, rhea, rhea, pennata, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, classifies, the, puna, rhea, as, another, species, instead, of, a, subspecies, of, the, lesser, rhea, the, iucn, currently, rates, the, greater, and, puna, rheas, as, near, threatened, in, their, native, ranges, while, darwin, s, rhea, is, of, least, concern, having, recovered, from, past, threats, to, its, survival, in, addition, the, feral, population, of, the, greater, rhea, in, germany, appears, to, be, growing, however, control, efforts, are, underway, and, seem, to, succeed, in, controlling, the, birds, population, growth, similarly, to, ostriches, and, emus, rheas, are, fairly, popular, livestock, and, pets, regularly, kept, and, bred, on, farms, ranches, private, parks, and, by, aviculturists, mainly, in, north, and, south, america, and, europe, the, name, rhea, was, used, in, 1752, by, paul, m, hring, and, adopted, as, the, english, common, name, m, hring, named, the, rhea, after, the, greek, titan, rhea, whose, ancient, greek, name, is, thought, to, come, from, ra, ground, this, was, fitting, with, the, rhea, being, a, flightless, ground, bird, depending, on, the, south, american, region, the, rhea, is, known, locally, as, and, guazu, guaran, or, related, tupi, nhand, g, as, meaning, big, spider, most, probably, concerning, their, habit, of, opening, and, lowering, alternate, wings, when, they, run, ema, portuguese, suri, aymara, and, quechua, or, choique, mapudungun, nandu, is, the, common, name, in, many, european, languages, and, may, sometimes, be, heard, in, english, the, genus, rhea, was, introduced, by, french, zoologist, mathurin, jacques, brisson, in, 1760, with, the, greater, rhea, rhea, americana, as, the, type, species, the, genus, contains, two, extant, species, and, eight, subspecies, although, one, subspecies, is, disputed, rhea, pennata, was, not, always, in, the, genus, rhea, in, 2008, the, sacc, the, last, holdout, approved, merging, the, genera, rhea, and, pterocnemia, on, august, 7, 2008, this, merging, of, genera, leaves, only, the, genus, rhea, a, former, fourth, species, of, rhea, rhea, nana, was, described, by, lydekker, in, 1894, based, on, a, single, egg, found, in, patagonia, but, today, no, major, authorities, consider, it, valid, rheas, are, large, flightless, birds, with, grey, brown, plumage, long, legs, and, long, necks, similar, to, an, ostrich, large, males, of, r, americana, can, reach, 170, cm, 67, in, tall, at, the, head, 100, cm, 39, in, at, the, back, and, can, weigh, up, to, 40, kg, 88, lb, the, lesser, rhea, is, smaller, with, a, height, of, 100, cm, 39, in, their, wings, are, large, for, a, flightless, bird, 250, cm, 8, 2, ft, and, are, spread, while, running, to, act, like, sails, unlike, most, birds, rheas, have, only, three, toes, their, tarsus, has, 18, to, 22, horizontal, plates, on, the, front, of, it, they, also, store, urine, separately, in, an, expansion, of, the, cloaca, rheas, are, from, south, america, only, and, are, limited, within, the, continent, to, argentina, bolivia, brazil, chile, paraguay, peru, and, uruguay, they, are, grassland, birds, and, both, species, prefer, open, land, the, greater, rheas, live, in, open, grasslands, pampas, and, chaco, woodlands, they, prefer, to, breed, near, water, and, prefer, lowlands, seldom, going, above, 1, 500, metres, 4, 900, ft, on, the, other, hand, the, lesser, rhea, will, inhabit, most, shrubland, grassland, even, desert, salt, puna, up, to, 4, 500, metres, 14, 800, ft, a, small, population, of, rheas, has, emerged, in, mecklenburg, western, pomerania, northeastern, germany, after, several, couples, escaped, from, an, exotic, meat, farm, near, l, beck, in, the, late, 1990s, contrary, to, expectations, the, large, birds, adapted, well, to, conditions, in, the, german, countryside, a, monitoring, system, has, been, in, place, since, 2008, by, 2014, there, was, already, a, population, of, well, over, 100, birds, in, an, area, of, 150, square, kilometres, 58, sq, mi, between, the, river, wakenitz, and, the, a20, motorway, slowly, expanding, eastward, the, population, grew, steadily, for, several, years, by, autumn, 2018, their, numbers, had, significantly, increased, to, about, 600, as, such, local, farmers, claim, increasing, damage, to, their, fields, and, some, biologists, say, the, rheas, pose, a, growing, risk, to, local, wildlife, still, protected, by, german, natural, conservation, law, a, local, discussion, developed, regarding, how, to, handle, the, situation, eventually, mecklenburg, western, pomerania, s, government, allowed, limited, hunting, of, the, birds, explicitly, to, just, reduce, the, population, s, growth, and, not, to, wipe, them, out, at, this, point, it, was, generally, agreed, that, the, rheas, should, be, allowed, to, stay, in, the, region, by, spring, 2021, just, 247, rheas, were, counted, this, development, was, attributed, to, both, the, hunting, and, the, increased, caution, of, the, animals, several, had, begun, to, avoid, humans, more, than, previously, and, retreated, into, the, woods, some, members, of, this, rhea, population, have, also, expanded, into, other, areas, at, least, twice, individual, rheas, who, probably, originated, in, mecklenburg, western, pomerania, were, sighted, in, brandenburg, s, high, fl, ming, nature, park, over, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, from, their, usual, range, by, early, 2023, 91, rheas, were, counted, in, mecklenburg, western, pomerania, the, population, decline, was, attributed, to, both, hunting, as, well, as, harsher, weather, of, previous, years, by, this, point, german, authorities, believed, a, stable, population, of, 50, adult, birds, would, be, optimal, for, the, local, ecosystem, and, agriculture, researchers, concluded, that, the, feral, population, was, subject, to, substantial, fluctuations, but, remained, healthy, adaptable, and, entrenched, in, the, area, there, also, appears, to, be, a, small, population, of, wild, rheas, in, the, united, kingdom, in, march, 2021, about, 20, rheas, were, reportedly, running, free, on, a, residential, estate, in, hertfordshire, local, police, could, not, identify, any, owner, so, they, assumed, they, were, wild, birds, once, caught, authorities, intend, to, place, them, in, a, suitable, nature, reserve, to, allow, them, to, develop, as, a, colony, rheas, tend, to, be, silent, birds, except, when, they, are, chicks, or, the, male, seeks, a, mate, during, the, breeding, season, the, male, will, attempt, to, attract, females, by, calling, this, call, is, a, loud, booming, noise, while, calling, like, this, they, will, lift, the, front, of, their, body, and, ruffle, their, plumage, all, while, keeping, their, neck, stiff, they, will, then, extend, and, raise, their, wings, and, run, short, distances, alternating, with, their, wings, he, may, then, single, out, a, female, and, walk, alongside, or, in, front, of, her, with, a, lowered, head, and, spread, wings, if, the, female, notices, him, he, will, wave, his, neck, back, and, forth, in, a, figure, eight, finally, a, female, may, offer, herself, and, copulation, will, commence, during, the, non, breeding, season, they, may, form, flocks, of, between, 20, and, 25, birds, although, the, lesser, rhea, forms, smaller, flocks, than, this, when, in, danger, they, flee, in, a, zigzag, course, using, one, wing, and, the, other, similar, to, a, rudder, during, the, breeding, season, the, flocks, break, up, mostly, rheas, are, herbivorous, and, prefer, broad, leafed, plants, but, they, also, eat, fruits, seeds, roots, and, insects, such, as, grasshoppers, small, reptiles, and, rodents, young, rheas, eat, only, insects, for, the, first, few, days, outside, the, breeding, season, they, gather, in, flocks, and, feed, with, deer, and, cattle, rheas, are, polygynandrous, with, males, courting, between, two, and, twelve, females, and, females, commonly, mating, with, multiple, dominant, males, during, the, breeding, season, after, mating, the, male, builds, a, nest, where, each, female, lays, eggs, the, nest, is, a, simple, scrape, in, the, ground, lined, with, grass, and, leaves, the, male, incubates, from, ten, to, sixty, eggs, the, male, will, use, a, decoy, system, and, place, some, eggs, outside, the, nest, then, sacrifice, these, to, predators, so, they, do, not, attempt, to, get, inside, the, nest, the, male, may, use, another, subordinate, male, to, incubate, his, eggs, while, he, finds, another, group, of, females, to, start, a, second, nest, with, the, chicks, hatch, within, 36, hours, of, each, other, right, before, hatching, the, chicks, begin, to, whistle, the, group, of, females, meanwhile, may, move, on, and, mate, with, other, males, while, caring, for, the, young, the, males, will, charge, at, any, perceived, threat, approaching, the, chicks, including, female, rheas, and, humans, the, young, reach, full, adult, size, in, about, six, months, but, do, not, breed, until, they, reach, two, years, of, age, the, numbers, of, the, greater, and, puna, rhea, are, decreasing, as, their, habitats, shrink, both, are, considered, near, threatened, by, the, iucn, the, iucn, also, states, that, they, are, both, approaching, vulnerable, status, the, lesser, rhea, is, classified, as, least, concern, rheas, have, many, uses, in, south, america, feathers, are, used, for, feather, dusters, skins, are, used, for, cloaks, or, leather, and, their, meat, is, a, staple, to, many, people, gauchos, traditionally, hunt, rheas, on, horseback, throwing, bolas, or, boleadoras, a, throwing, device, consisting, of, three, balls, joined, by, rope, at, their, legs, which, immobilises, the, bird, the, rhea, is, pictured, on, argentina, s, 1, centavo, coin, minted, in, 1987, and, on, the, uruguayan, 5, peso, coin
