in, a, multicellular, organism, an, organ, is, a, collection, of, tissues, joined, in, a, structural, unit, to, serve, a, common, function, in, the, hierarchy, of, life, an, organ, lies, between, tissue, and, an, organ, system, tissues, are, formed, from, same, type, cells, to, act, together, in, a, function, tissues, of, different, types, combine, to, form, an, organ, which, has, a, specific, function, the, intestinal, wall, for, example, is, formed, by, epithelial, tissue, and, smooth, muscle, tissue, two, or, more, organs, working, together, in, the, execution, of, a, specific, body, function, form, an, organ, system, also, called, a, biological, system, or, body, system, an, organ, s, tissues, can, be, broadly, categorized, as, parenchyma, the, functional, tissue, and, stroma, the, structural, tissue, with, supportive, connective, or, ancillary, functions, for, example, the, gland, s, tissue, that, makes, the, hormones, is, the, parenchyma, whereas, the, stroma, includes, the, nerves, that, innervate, the, parenchyma, the, blood, vessels, that, oxygenate, and, nourish, it, and, carry, away, its, metabolic, wastes, and, the, connective, tissues, that, provide, a, suitable, place, for, it, to, be, situated, and, anchored, the, main, tissues, that, make, up, an, organ, tend, to, have, common, embryologic, origins, such, as, arising, from, the, same, germ, layer, organs, exist, in, most, multicellular, organisms, in, single, celled, organisms, such, as, members, of, the, eukaryotes, the, functional, analogue, of, an, organ, is, known, as, an, organelle, in, plants, there, are, three, main, organs, the, number, of, organs, in, any, organism, depends, on, the, definition, used, by, one, widely, adopted, definition, 79, organs, have, been, identified, in, the, human, body, except, for, placozoans, multicellular, animals, including, humans, have, a, variety, of, organ, systems, these, specific, systems, are, widely, studied, in, human, anatomy, the, functions, of, these, organ, systems, often, share, significant, overlap, for, instance, the, nervous, and, endocrine, system, both, operate, via, a, shared, organ, the, hypothalamus, for, this, reason, the, two, systems, are, combined, and, studied, as, the, neuroendocrine, system, the, same, is, true, for, the, musculoskeletal, system, because, of, the, relationship, between, the, muscular, and, skeletal, systems, in, the, study, of, anatomy, viscera, sg, viscus, refers, to, the, internal, organs, of, the, abdominal, thoracic, and, pelvic, cavities, the, abdominal, organs, may, be, classified, as, solid, organs, or, hollow, organs, the, solid, organs, are, the, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and, adrenal, glands, the, hollow, organs, of, the, abdomen, are, the, stomach, intestines, gallbladder, bladder, and, rectum, in, the, thoracic, cavity, the, heart, is, a, hollow, muscular, organ, splanchnology, is, the, study, of, the, viscera, the, term, visceral, is, contrasted, with, the, term, parietal, meaning, of, or, relating, to, the, wall, of, a, body, part, organ, or, cavity, the, two, terms, are, often, used, in, describing, a, membrane, or, piece, of, connective, tissue, referring, to, the, opposing, sides, the, organ, level, of, organisation, in, animals, can, be, first, detected, in, flatworms, and, the, more, derived, phyla, i, e, the, bilaterians, the, less, advanced, taxa, i, e, placozoa, porifera, ctenophora, and, cnidaria, do, not, show, consolidation, of, their, tissues, into, organs, more, complex, animals, are, composed, of, different, organs, which, have, evolved, over, time, for, example, the, liver, and, heart, evolved, in, the, chordates, about, 550, 500, million, years, ago, while, the, gut, and, brain, are, even, more, ancient, arising, in, the, ancestor, of, vertebrates, insects, molluscs, and, worms, about, 700, 650, million, years, ago, given, the, ancient, origin, of, most, vertebrate, organs, researchers, have, looked, for, model, systems, where, organs, have, evolved, more, recently, and, ideally, have, evolved, multiple, times, independently, an, outstanding, model, for, this, kind, of, research, is, the, placenta, which, has, evolved, more, than, 100, times, independently, in, vertebrates, has, evolved, relatively, recently, in, some, lineages, and, exists, in, intermediate, forms, in, extant, taxa, studies, on, the, evolution, of, the, placenta, have, identified, a, variety, of, genetic, and, physiological, processes, that, contribute, to, the, origin, and, evolution, of, organs, these, include, the, re, purposing, of, existing, animal, tissues, the, acquisition, of, new, functional, properties, by, these, tissues, and, novel, interactions, of, distinct, tissue, types, the, study, of, plant, organs, is, covered, in, plant, morphology, organs, of, plants, can, be, divided, into, vegetative, and, reproductive, vegetative, plant, organs, include, roots, stems, and, leaves, the, reproductive, organs, are, variable, in, flowering, plants, they, are, represented, by, the, flower, seed, and, fruit, in, conifers, the, organ, that, bears, the, reproductive, structures, is, called, a, cone, in, other, divisions, phyla, of, plants, the, reproductive, organs, are, called, strobili, in, lycopodiophyta, or, simply, gametophores, in, mosses, common, organ, system, designations, in, plants, include, the, differentiation, of, shoot, and, root, all, parts, of, the, plant, above, ground, in, non, epiphytes, including, the, functionally, distinct, leaf, and, flower, organs, may, be, classified, together, as, the, shoot, organ, system, the, vegetative, organs, are, essential, for, maintaining, the, life, of, a, plant, while, there, can, be, 11, organ, systems, in, animals, there, are, far, fewer, in, plants, where, some, perform, the, vital, functions, such, as, photosynthesis, while, the, reproductive, organs, are, essential, in, reproduction, however, if, there, is, asexual, vegetative, reproduction, the, vegetative, organs, are, those, that, create, the, new, generation, of, plants, see, clonal, colony, many, societies, have, a, system, for, organ, donation, in, which, a, living, or, deceased, donor, s, organ, are, transplanted, into, a, person, with, a, failing, organ, the, transplantation, of, larger, solid, organs, often, requires, immunosuppression, to, prevent, organ, rejection, or, graft, versus, host, disease, there, is, considerable, interest, throughout, the, world, in, creating, laboratory, grown, or, artificial, organs, beginning, in, the, 20th, century, organ, transplants, began, to, take, place, as, scientists, knew, more, about, the, anatomy, of, organs, these, came, later, in, time, as, procedures, were, often, dangerous, and, difficult, both, the, source, and, method, of, obtaining, the, organ, to, transplant, are, major, ethical, issues, to, consider, and, because, organs, as, resources, for, transplant, are, always, more, limited, than, demand, for, them, various, notions, of, justice, including, distributive, justice, are, developed, in, the, ethical, analysis, this, situation, continues, as, long, as, transplantation, relies, upon, organ, donors, rather, than, technological, innovation, testing, and, industrial, manufacturing, the, english, word, organ, dates, back, to, the, twelfth, century, and, refers, to, any, musical, instrument, by, the, late, 14th, century, the, musical, term, s, meaning, had, narrowed, to, refer, specifically, to, the, keyboard, based, instrument, at, the, same, time, a, second, meaning, arose, in, reference, to, a, body, part, adapted, to, a, certain, function, plant, organs, are, made, from, tissue, composed, of, different, types, of, tissue, the, three, tissue, types, are, ground, vascular, and, dermal, when, three, or, more, organs, are, present, it, is, called, an, organ, system, the, adjective, visceral, also, splanchnic, is, used, for, anything, pertaining, to, the, internal, organs, historically, viscera, of, animals, were, examined, by, roman, pagan, priests, like, the, haruspices, or, the, augurs, in, order, to, divine, the, future, by, their, shape, dimensions, or, other, factors, this, practice, remains, an, important, ritual, in, some, remote, tribal, societies, the, term, visceral, is, contrasted, with, the, term, parietal, meaning, of, or, relating, to, the, wall, of, a, body, part, organ, or, cavity, the, two, terms, are, often, used, in, describing, a, membrane, or, piece, of, connective, tissue, referring, to, the, opposing, sides, aristotle, used, the, word, frequently, in, his, philosophy, both, to, describe, the, organs, of, plants, or, animals, e, g, the, roots, of, a, tree, the, heart, or, liver, of, an, animal, and, to, describe, more, abstract, parts, of, an, interconnected, whole, e, g, his, logical, works, taken, as, a, whole, are, referred, to, as, the, organon, some, alchemists, e, g, paracelsus, adopted, the, hermetic, qabalah, assignment, between, the, seven, vital, organs, and, the, seven, classical, planets, as, follows, chinese, traditional, medicine, recognizes, eleven, organs, associated, with, the, five, chinese, traditional, elements, and, with, yin, and, yang, as, follows, the, chinese, associated, the, five, elements, with, the, five, planets, jupiter, mars, venus, saturn, and, mercury, similar, to, the, way, the, classical, planets, were, associated, with, different, metals, the, yin, and, yang, distinction, approximates, the, modern, notion, of, solid, and, hollow, organs
