the, siamese, cat, thai, maeo, thai, maeo, sayam, is, one, of, the, first, distinctly, recognised, breeds, of, asian, cat, derived, from, the, wichianmat, landrace, one, of, several, varieties, of, cats, native, to, thailand, formerly, known, as, siam, the, original, siamese, became, one, of, the, most, popular, breeds, in, europe, and, north, america, in, the, 19th, century, siamese, cats, have, a, distinctive, colourpoint, coat, resulting, from, a, temperature, sensitive, type, of, albinism, the, carefully, refined, more, extreme, featured, modern, style, siamese, is, characterised, by, blue, almond, shaped, eyes, a, triangular, head, shape, large, ears, an, elongated, slender, and, muscular, body, and, various, forms, of, point, colouration, other, than, point, colouration, the, modern, style, siamese, bears, little, resemblance, to, the, original, foundation, stock, and, the, more, moderate, traditional, or, old, style, siamese, with, a, much, rounder, head, and, body, has, been, re, established, by, multiple, registries, as, the, thai, cat, both, siamese, and, thai, cats, are, separately, selectively, bred, by, breeders, and, pedigreed, in, multiple, major, cat, fancier, and, breeder, organisations, similar, to, other, officially, recognised, cat, breeds, the, term, siamese, or, thai, is, only, meant, to, be, used, for, cats, from, this, specific, breed, which, are, by, definition, all, purebred, cats, with, a, known, and, formally, registered, ancestry, also, known, as, the, cat, s, pedigree, or, paperwork, the, siamese, sometimes, in, the, traditional, form, is, among, the, foundation, stock, of, several, other, breeds, developed, by, crossbreeding, with, other, cats, some, examples, are, the, oriental, shorthair, and, colourpoint, shorthair, developed, to, expand, the, range, of, coat, patterns, the, long, haired, variant, most, often, dubbed, the, himalayan, and, hair, mutation, breeds, including, the, cornish, rex, sphynx, peterbald, and, blue, point, siamese, cat, the, long, haired, siamese, is, recognised, internationally, as, a, balinese, cat, a, description, and, depiction, of, the, wichienmaat, siamese, cat, first, appears, in, a, collection, of, ancient, manuscripts, called, the, tamra, maew, the, cat, book, poems, thought, to, originate, from, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, 1351, to, 1767, ad, over, a, dozen, are, now, kept, in, the, national, library, of, thailand, while, others, have, resurfaced, outside, of, thailand, and, are, now, in, the, british, library, and, national, library, of, australia, in, addition, to, the, old, siamese, cat, the, tamra, maew, also, describes, other, heritage, cats, of, thailand, including, the, korat, cat, malet, which, is, still, bred, for, preservation, in, thailand, today, and, has, become, popular, in, other, countries, and, the, konja, or, korn, ja, black, cat, when, the, capital, city, ayutthaya, was, sacked, on, 7, april, 1767, at, the, end, of, the, burmese, siamese, war, the, burmese, army, burned, everything, in, sight, it, returned, to, burma, taking, siamese, noblemen, and, royal, family, members, with, them, as, captives, buddha, images, were, hacked, apart, for, their, gold, and, all, the, royal, treasures, were, stolen, a, thai, legend, has, it, that, the, king, of, burma, hsinbyushin, found, and, read, the, poem, for, the, thai, cats, in, the, tamra, maew, the, poem, describes, thai, cats, as, being, as, rare, as, gold, and, anyone, who, owns, this, cat, will, become, wealthy, he, told, his, army, to, round, up, all, the, suphalak, cats, and, bring, them, back, to, burma, along, with, the, other, treasures, today, in, thailand, this, legend, is, told, as, a, humorous, explanation, of, the, rarity, of, thai, cats, the, pointed, cat, known, in, the, west, as, siamese, recognised, for, its, distinctive, markings, is, one, of, several, breeds, of, cats, from, siam, described, and, illustrated, in, manuscripts, called, tamra, maew, cat, poems, estimated, to, have, been, written, from, the, 14th, to, the, 18th, century, in, 1878, u, s, president, rutherford, b, hayes, received, the, first, documented, siamese, to, reach, the, united, states, a, cat, named, siam, sent, by, the, american, consul, in, bangkok, in, 1884, the, british, consul, general, in, bangkok, edward, blencowe, gould, 1847, 1916, brought, a, breeding, pair, of, the, cats, pho, and, mia, back, to, britain, as, a, gift, for, his, sister, lilian, jane, gould, who, married, in, 1895, as, lilian, jane, veley, went, on, to, co, found, the, siamese, cat, club, in, 1901, in, 1885, gould, s, uk, cats, pho, and, mia, produced, three, siamese, kittens, duen, ngai, kalohom, and, khromata, who, were, shown, with, their, parents, that, same, year, at, london, s, crystal, palace, show, their, unique, appearance, and, distinct, behaviour, attracted, attention, but, all, three, of, the, kittens, died, soon, after, the, show, their, cause, of, death, not, documented, by, 1886, another, pair, with, kittens, was, imported, to, the, uk, by, eva, forestier, walker, surnamed, vyvyan, after, 1887, marriage, and, her, sister, ada, compared, to, the, british, shorthair, and, persian, cats, that, were, familiar, to, most, britons, these, siamese, imports, were, longer, and, less, cobby, in, body, types, had, heads, that, were, less, rounded, with, wedge, shaped, muzzles, and, had, larger, ears, these, differences, and, the, pointed, coat, pattern, which, had, not, been, seen, before, in, cats, by, westerners, produced, a, strong, impression, one, early, viewer, described, them, as, an, unnatural, nightmare, of, a, cat, over, the, next, several, years, fanciers, imported, a, small, number, of, cats, forming, the, base, breeding, pool, for, the, entire, breed, in, britain, it, is, believed, that, most, siamese, in, britain, today, are, descended, from, about, eleven, of, these, original, imports, in, their, early, days, in, britain, they, were, called, the, royal, cat, of, siam, reflecting, reports, that, they, had, previously, been, kept, only, by, siamese, royalty, later, research, has, not, shown, evidence, of, any, organised, royal, breeding, programme, in, siam, the, original, siamese, imports, were, medium, sized, rather, long, bodied, muscular, graceful, cats, with, moderately, wedge, shaped, heads, and, ears, that, were, comparatively, large, but, in, proportion, to, the, size, of, the, head, the, cats, ranged, from, substantial, to, slender, but, were, not, extreme, either, in, the, 1950s, 1960s, as, the, siamese, was, increasing, in, popularity, many, breeders, and, cat, show, judges, began, to, favour, the, more, slender, look, as, a, result, of, generations, of, selective, breeding, they, created, increasingly, long, fine, boned, narrow, headed, cats, eventually, the, modern, show, siamese, was, bred, to, be, extremely, elongated, with, a, lean, tubular, body, long, slender, legs, a, very, long, very, thin, tail, that, tapers, gradually, into, a, point, and, a, long, wedge, shaped, head, topped, by, extremely, large, wide, set, ears, by, the, mid, 1980s, cats, of, the, original, style, had, largely, disappeared, from, cat, shows, still, a, few, breeders, particularly, in, the, uk, continued, to, breed, and, register, them, resulting, in, today, s, two, types, of, siamese, the, modern, show, style, standardised, siamese, and, the, traditional, siamese, both, descended, from, the, same, distant, ancestors, but, with, few, or, no, recent, ancestors, in, common, and, effectively, forming, distinct, sub, breeds, with, some, pressure, to, separate, them, in, addition, to, the, modern, siamese, breed, category, the, international, cat, association, tica, and, the, world, cat, federation, wcf, now, accept, siamese, cats, of, the, less, extreme, type, and, any, wichianmat, cat, imported, directly, from, thailand, under, the, new, breed, name, thai, other, mostly, unofficial, names, for, the, traditional, variety, are, old, style, siamese, and, classic, siamese, with, an, american, variation, nicknamed, applehead, originally, a, derogatory, nickname, due, to, its, extremely, rounded, features, compared, to, what, had, become, show, breed, standard, siamese, the, breed, standard, of, the, modern, siamese, calls, for, an, elongated, tubular, and, muscular, body, and, a, triangular, head, forming, a, perfect, triangle, from, the, tip, of, the, nose, to, each, tip, of, the, ear, the, eyes, are, almond, shaped, and, light, blue, while, the, ears, are, large, wide, based, and, positioned, more, towards, the, side, of, the, head, the, breed, has, a, long, neck, a, slender, tail, and, fur, that, is, short, glossy, fine, and, adheres, to, the, body, with, no, undercoat, its, pointed, colour, scheme, and, blue, eyes, distinguish, it, from, the, closely, related, oriental, shorthair, the, modern, siamese, shares, the, pointed, colour, pattern, with, the, thai, or, traditional, siamese, but, they, differ, in, head, and, body, type, the, pointed, pattern, is, a, form, of, partial, albinism, resulting, from, a, mutation, in, tyrosinase, an, enzyme, involved, in, melanin, production, the, mutated, tyrosinase, enzyme, is, heat, sensitive, it, fails, to, work, at, normal, body, temperatures, but, becomes, active, in, cooler, 33, c, areas, of, the, skin, this, results, in, dark, colouration, in, the, coolest, parts, of, the, cat, s, body, including, the, extremities, and, the, face, which, is, cooled, by, the, passage, of, air, through, the, sinuses, all, siamese, kittens, although, pure, cream, or, white, at, birth, develop, visible, points, in, the, first, few, months, of, life, in, colder, parts, of, their, body, by, the, time, a, kitten, is, four, weeks, old, the, points, should, be, sufficiently, distinguishable, to, recognise, which, colour, they, are, siamese, cats, tend, to, darken, with, age, and, generally, adult, siamese, living, in, warm, climates, have, lighter, coats, than, those, in, cool, climates, originally, the, vast, majority, of, siamese, had, seal, extremely, dark, brown, almost, black, points, but, occasionally, siamese, was, born, with, blue, a, cool, grey, points, genetically, a, dilution, of, seal, point, chocolate, lighter, brown, points, a, genetic, variation, of, seal, point, or, lilac, pale, warm, grey, points, genetically, a, diluted, chocolate, these, colours, were, considered, inferior, seal, points, and, were, not, qualified, for, showing, or, breeding, these, shades, were, eventually, accepted, by, the, breed, associations, and, became, more, common, through, breeding, programmes, specifically, aimed, at, producing, these, colours, later, outcrosses, with, other, breeds, developed, siamese, mix, cats, with, points, in, other, cat, colours, and, patterns, including, red, and, cream, points, lynx, tabby, points, and, tortoise, shell, tortie, points, for, more, information, on, cat, coat, terminology, see, cat, coat, genetics, in, the, united, kingdom, all, pointed, siamese, style, cats, are, considered, part, of, the, siamese, breed, the, cat, fanciers, association, considers, only, the, four, original, fur, colours, as, siamese, oriental, shorthair, cats, with, colour, points, in, colours, or, patterns, aside, from, these, four, are, considered, colourpoint, shorthair, in, that, registry, the, world, cat, federation, has, also, adopted, this, classification, treating, the, colourpoint, shorthair, as, a, distinct, breed, many, siamese, cats, from, thailand, had, a, kink, in, their, tails, but, over, the, years, this, trait, has, been, considered, a, flaw, breeders, have, largely, eradicated, it, but, the, kinked, tail, persists, among, street, cats, in, thailand, siamese, are, usually, very, affectionate, and, intelligent, cats, renowned, for, their, social, nature, many, enjoy, being, with, people, and, are, sometimes, described, as, extroverts, often, they, bond, strongly, with, a, single, person, myrna, milani, describes, the, siamese, as, being, more, diurnal, more, likely, to, stay, close, to, their, owner, and, less, likely, to, hunt, than, other, cats, based, on, swedish, insurance, data, which, tracked, cats, only, up, to, 12, 5, years, siamese, and, siamese, derived, breeds, have, a, higher, mortality, rate, than, other, breeds, 68, lived, to, 10, years, or, more, and, 42, to, 12, 5, years, or, more, the, majority, of, deaths, were, caused, by, neoplasms, mainly, mammary, tumours, the, siamese, also, has, a, higher, rate, of, morbidity, they, are, at, higher, risk, of, neoplastic, and, gastrointestinal, problems, but, have, a, lower, risk, of, feline, lower, urinary, tract, disease, a, uk, study, of, veterinary, records, found, a, life, expectancy, of, 11, 69, years, for, the, siamese, compared, with, 11, 74, years, overall, the, siamese, has, been, found, to, have, a, predisposition, to, progressive, retinal, atrophy, the, same, albino, allele, that, produces, coloured, points, means, that, siamese, cats, blue, eyes, lack, a, tapetum, lucidum, a, structure, which, amplifies, dim, light, in, the, eyes, of, other, cats, the, mutation, in, the, tyrosinase, also, results, in, abnormal, neurological, connections, between, the, eye, and, the, brain, the, optic, chiasm, has, abnormal, uncrossed, wiring, many, early, siamese, were, cross, eyed, to, compensate, but, like, the, kinked, tails, the, crossed, eyes, have, been, seen, as, a, fault, and, due, to, selective, breeding, the, trait, is, far, less, common, today, still, this, lack, of, a, tapetum, lucidum, even, in, uncross, eyed, cats, causes, reduced, vision, for, the, cat, at, night, this, trait, makes, them, vulnerable, to, urban, dangers, such, as, night, time, vehicular, traffic, unlike, many, other, blue, eyed, white, cats, siamese, cats, do, not, have, reduced, hearing,
