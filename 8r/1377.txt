brain, injury, bi, is, the, destruction, or, degeneration, of, brain, cells, brain, injuries, occur, due, to, a, wide, range, of, internal, and, external, factors, in, general, brain, damage, refers, to, significant, undiscriminating, trauma, induced, damage, a, common, category, with, the, greatest, number, of, injuries, is, traumatic, brain, injury, tbi, following, physical, trauma, or, head, injury, from, an, outside, source, and, the, term, acquired, brain, injury, abi, is, used, in, appropriate, circles, to, differentiate, brain, injuries, occurring, after, birth, from, injury, from, a, genetic, disorder, gbi, or, from, a, congenital, disorder, cbi, primary, and, secondary, brain, injuries, identify, the, processes, involved, while, focal, and, diffuse, brain, injury, describe, the, severity, and, localization, impaired, function, of, affected, areas, can, be, compensated, through, neuroplasticity, by, forming, new, neural, connections, symptoms, of, brain, injuries, vary, based, on, the, severity, of, the, injury, or, how, much, of, the, brain, is, affected, the, four, categories, used, for, classifying, the, severity, of, brain, injuries, are, mild, moderate, or, severe, symptoms, of, a, mild, brain, injury, include, headaches, confusions, tinnitus, fatigue, changes, in, sleep, patterns, mood, or, behavior, other, symptoms, include, trouble, with, memory, concentration, attention, or, thinking, mental, fatigue, is, a, common, debilitating, experience, and, may, not, be, linked, by, the, patient, to, the, original, minor, incident, cognitive, symptoms, include, confusion, aggressiveness, abnormal, behavior, slurred, speech, and, coma, or, other, disorders, of, consciousness, physical, symptoms, include, headaches, that, worsen, or, do, not, go, away, vomiting, or, nausea, convulsions, brain, pulsation, abnormal, dilation, of, the, eyes, inability, to, awaken, from, sleep, weakness, in, extremities, and, loss, of, coordination, symptoms, observed, in, children, include, changes, in, eating, habits, persistent, irritability, or, sadness, changes, in, attention, or, disrupted, sleeping, habits, symptoms, of, brain, injuries, can, also, be, influenced, by, the, location, of, the, injury, and, as, a, result, impairments, are, specific, to, the, part, of, the, brain, affected, lesion, size, is, correlated, with, severity, recovery, and, comprehension, brain, injuries, often, create, impairment, or, disability, that, can, vary, greatly, in, severity, in, cases, of, severe, brain, injuries, the, likelihood, of, areas, with, permanent, disability, is, great, including, neurocognitive, deficits, delusions, often, to, be, specific, monothematic, delusions, speech, or, movement, problems, and, intellectual, disability, there, may, also, be, personality, changes, the, most, severe, cases, result, in, coma, or, even, persistent, vegetative, state, even, a, mild, incident, can, have, long, term, effects, or, cause, symptoms, to, appear, years, later, studies, show, there, is, a, correlation, between, brain, lesion, and, language, speech, and, category, specific, disorders, wernicke, s, aphasia, is, associated, with, anomia, unknowingly, making, up, words, neologisms, and, problems, with, comprehension, the, symptoms, of, wernicke, s, aphasia, are, caused, by, damage, to, the, posterior, section, of, the, superior, temporal, gyrus, damage, to, the, broca, s, area, typically, produces, symptoms, like, omitting, functional, words, agrammatism, sound, production, changes, dyslexia, dysgraphia, and, problems, with, comprehension, and, production, broca, s, aphasia, is, indicative, of, damage, to, the, posterior, inferior, frontal, gyrus, of, the, brain, an, impairment, following, damage, to, a, region, of, the, brain, does, not, necessarily, imply, that, the, damaged, area, is, wholly, responsible, for, the, cognitive, process, which, is, impaired, however, for, example, in, pure, alexia, the, ability, to, read, is, destroyed, by, a, lesion, damaging, both, the, left, visual, field, and, the, connection, between, the, right, visual, field, and, the, language, areas, broca, s, area, and, wernicke, s, area, however, this, does, not, mean, one, with, pure, alexia, is, incapable, of, comprehending, speech, merely, that, there, is, no, connection, between, their, working, visual, cortex, and, language, areas, as, is, demonstrated, by, the, fact, that, people, with, pure, alexia, can, still, write, speak, and, even, transcribe, letters, without, understanding, their, meaning, lesions, to, the, fusiform, gyrus, often, result, in, prosopagnosia, the, inability, to, distinguish, faces, and, other, complex, objects, from, each, other, lesions, in, the, amygdala, would, eliminate, the, enhanced, activation, seen, in, occipital, and, fusiform, visual, areas, in, response, to, fear, with, the, area, intact, amygdala, lesions, change, the, functional, pattern, of, activation, to, emotional, stimuli, in, regions, that, are, distant, from, the, amygdala, other, lesions, to, the, visual, cortex, have, different, effects, depending, on, the, location, of, the, damage, lesions, to, v1, for, example, can, cause, blindsight, in, different, areas, of, the, brain, depending, on, the, size, of, the, lesion, and, location, relative, to, the, calcarine, fissure, lesions, to, v4, can, cause, color, blindness, and, bilateral, lesions, to, mt, v5, can, cause, the, loss, of, the, ability, to, perceive, motion, lesions, to, the, parietal, lobes, may, result, in, agnosia, an, inability, to, recognize, complex, objects, smells, or, shapes, or, amorphosynthesis, a, loss, of, perception, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, body, brain, injuries, have, far, reaching, and, varied, consequences, due, to, the, nature, of, the, brain, as, the, main, source, of, bodily, control, brain, injured, people, commonly, experience, issues, with, memory, this, can, be, issues, with, either, long, or, short, term, memories, depending, on, the, location, and, severity, of, the, injury, sometimes, memory, can, be, improved, through, rehabilitation, although, it, can, be, permanent, behavioral, and, personality, changes, are, also, commonly, observed, due, to, changes, of, the, brain, structure, in, areas, controlling, hormones, or, major, emotions, headaches, and, pain, can, occur, as, a, result, of, a, brain, injury, either, directly, from, the, damage, or, due, to, neurological, conditions, stemming, from, the, injury, due, to, the, changes, in, the, brain, as, well, as, the, issues, associated, with, the, change, in, physical, and, mental, capacity, depression, and, low, self, esteem, are, common, side, effects, that, can, be, treated, with, psychological, help, antidepressants, must, be, used, with, caution, in, brain, injury, people, due, to, the, potential, for, undesired, effects, because, of, the, already, altered, brain, chemistry, there, are, multiple, responses, of, the, body, to, brain, injury, occurring, at, different, times, after, the, initial, occurrence, of, damage, as, the, functions, of, the, neurons, nerve, tracts, or, sections, of, the, brain, can, be, affected, by, damage, the, immediate, response, can, take, many, forms, initially, there, may, be, symptoms, such, as, swelling, pain, bruising, or, loss, of, consciousness, post, traumatic, amnesia, is, also, common, with, brain, damage, as, is, temporary, aphasia, or, impairment, of, language, as, time, progresses, and, the, severity, of, injury, becomes, clear, there, are, further, responses, that, may, become, apparent, due, to, loss, of, blood, flow, or, damaged, tissue, sustained, during, the, injury, amnesia, and, aphasia, may, become, permanent, and, apraxia, has, been, documented, in, patients, amnesia, is, a, condition, in, which, a, person, is, unable, to, remember, things, aphasia, is, the, loss, or, impairment, of, word, comprehension, or, use, apraxia, is, a, motor, disorder, caused, by, damage, to, the, brain, and, may, be, more, common, in, those, who, have, been, left, brain, damaged, with, loss, of, mechanical, knowledge, critical, headaches, occasional, dizziness, and, fatigue, all, temporary, symptoms, of, brain, trauma, may, become, permanent, or, may, not, disappear, for, a, long, time, there, are, documented, cases, of, lasting, psychological, effects, as, well, such, as, emotional, changes, often, caused, by, damage, to, the, various, parts, of, the, brain, that, control, human, emotions, and, behavior, individuals, who, have, experienced, emotional, changes, related, to, brain, damage, may, have, emotions, that, come, very, quickly, and, are, very, intense, but, have, very, little, lasting, effect, emotional, changes, may, not, be, triggered, by, a, specific, event, and, can, be, a, cause, of, stress, to, the, injured, party, and, their, family, and, friends, often, counseling, is, suggested, for, those, who, experience, this, effect, after, their, injury, and, may, be, available, as, an, individual, or, group, session, the, long, term, psychological, and, physiological, effects, will, vary, by, person, and, injury, for, example, perinatal, brain, damage, has, been, implicated, in, cases, of, neurodevelopmental, impairments, and, psychiatric, illnesses, if, any, concerning, symptoms, signs, or, changes, to, behaviors, are, occurring, a, healthcare, provider, should, be, consulted, brain, injuries, can, result, from, a, number, of, conditions, including, chemotherapy, can, cause, brain, damage, to, the, neural, stem, cells, and, oligodendrocyte, cells, that, produce, myelin, radiation, and, chemotherapy, can, lead, to, brain, tissue, damage, by, disrupting, or, stopping, blood, flow, to, the, affected, areas, of, the, brain, this, damage, can, cause, long, term, effects, such, as, but, not, limited, to, memory, loss, confusion, and, loss, of, cognitive, function, the, brain, damage, caused, by, radiation, depends, on, where, the, brain, tumor, is, located, the, amount, of, radiation, used, and, the, duration, of, the, treatment, radiosurgery, can, also, lead, to, tissue, damage, that, results, in, about, 1, in, 20, patients, requiring, a, second, operation, to, remove, the, damaged, tissue, wernicke, korsakoff, syndrome, can, cause, brain, damage, and, results, from, a, vitamin, b, deficiency, specifically, vitamin, b1, thiamine, this, syndrome, presents, with, two, conditions, wernicke, s, encephalopathy, and, korsakoff, psychosis, typically, wernicke, s, encephalopathy, precedes, symptoms, of, korsakoff, psychosis, wernicke, s, encephalopathy, results, from, focal, accumulation, of, lactic, acid, causing, problems, with, vision, coordination, and, balance, korsakoff, psychosis, typically, follows, after, the, symptoms, of, wernicke, s, decrease, wernicke, korsakoff, syndrome, is, typically, caused, by, conditions, causing, thiamine, deficiency, such, as, chronic, heavy, alcohol, use, or, by, conditions, that, affect, nutritional, absorption, including, colon, cancer, eating, disorders, and, gastric, bypass, brain, lesions, are, sometimes, intentionally, inflicted, during, neurosurgery, such, as, the, carefully, placed, brain, lesion, used, to, treat, epilepsy, and, other, brain, disorders, these, lesions, are, induced, by, excision, or, by, electric, shocks, electrolytic, lesions, to, the, exposed, brain, or, commonly, by, infusion, of, excitotoxins, to, specific, areas, diffuse, axonal, injury, is, caused, by, shearing, forces, on, the, brain, leading, to, lesions, in, the, white, matter, tracts, of, the, brain, these, shearing, forces, are, seen, in, cases, where, the, brain, had, a, sharp, rotational, acceleration, and, is, caused, by, the, difference, in, density, between, white, matter, and, grey, matter, unlike, some, of, the, more, obvious, responses, to, brain, damage, the, body, also, has, invisible, physical, responses, which, can, be, difficult, to, notice, these, will, generally, be, identified, by, a, healthcare, provider, especially, as, they, are, normal, physical, responses, to, brain, damage, cytokines, are, known, to, be, induced, in, response, to, brain, injury, these, have, diverse, actions, that, can, cause, exacerbate, mediate, and, or, inhibit, cellular, injury, and, repair, tgf, seems, to, exert, primarily, neuroprotective, actions, whereas, tnf, might, contribute, to, neuronal, injury, and, exert, protective, effects, il, 1, mediates, ischaemic, excitotoxic, and, traumatic, brain, injury, probably, through, multiple, actions, on, glia, neurons, and, the, vasculature, cytokines, may, be, useful, in, order, to, discover, novel, therapeutic, strategies, at, the, current, time, they, are, already, in, clinical, trials, glasgow, coma, scale, gcs, is, the, most, widely, used, scoring, system, used, to, assess, the, level, of, severity, of, a, brain, injury, this, method, is, based, on, the, objective, observations, of, specific, traits, to, determine, the, severity, of, a, brain, injury, it, is, based, on, three, traits, eye, opening, verbal, response, and, motor, response, gauged, as, described, below, based, on, the, glasgow, coma, scale, severity, is, classified, as, follows, severe, brain, injuries, score, 3, 8, moderate, brain, injuries, score, 9, 12, and, mild, score, 13, 15, there, are, several, imaging, techniques, that, can, aid, in, diagnosing, and, assessing, the, extent, of, brain, damage, such, as, computed, tomography, ct, scan, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, diffusion, tensor, imaging, dti, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, mrs, positron, emission, tomography, pet, and, single, photon, emission, tomography, spect, ct, scans, and, mri, are, the, two, techniques, widely, used, and, are, most, effective, ct, scans, can, show, brain, bleeds, fractures, of, the, skull, fluid, build, up, in, the, brain, that, will, lead, to, increased, cranial, pressure, mri, is, able, to, better, to, detect, smaller, injuries, detect, damage, within, the, brain, diffuse, axonal, injury, injuries, to, the, brainstem, posterior, fossa, and, subtemporal, and, subfrontal, regions, however, patients, with, pacemakers, metallic, implants, or, other, metal, within, their, bodies, are, unable, to, have, an, mri, done, typically, the, other, imaging, techniques, are, not, used, in, a, clinical, setting, because, of, the, cost, lack, of, availability, the, treatment, for, emergency, traumatic, brain, injuries, focuses, on, assuring, the, person, has, enough, oxygen, from, the, brain, s, blood, supply, and, on, maintaining, normal, blood, pressure, to, avoid, further, injuries, of, the, head, or, neck, the, person, may, need, surgery, to, remove, clotted, blood, or, repair, skull, fractures, for, which, cutting, a, hole, in, the, skull, may, be, necessary, medicines, used, for, traumatic, injuries, are, diuretics, anti, seizure, or, coma, inducing, drugs, diuretics, reduce, the, fluid, in, tissues, lowering, the, pressure, on, the, brain, in, the, first, week, after, a, traumatic, brain, injury, a, person, may, have, a, risk, of, seizures, which, anti, seizure, drugs, help, prevent, coma, inducing, drugs, may, be, used, during, surgery, to, reduce, impairments, and, restore, blood, flow, mouse, ngf, has, been, licensed, in, china, since, 2003, and, is, used, to, promote, neurological, recovery, in, a, range, of, brain, injuries, including, intracerebral, hemorrhage, in, the, case, of, brain, damage, from, traumatic, brain, injury, dexamethasone, and, or, mannitol, may, be, used, various, professions, may, be, involved, in, the, medical, care, and, rehabilitation, of, someone, with, an, impairment, after, a, brain, injury, neurologists, neurosurgeons, and, physiatrists, are, physicians, specialising, in, treating, brain, injury, neuropsychologists, especially, clinical, neuropsychologists, are, psychologists, specialising, in, understanding, the, effects, of, brain, injury, and, may, be, involved, in, assessing, the, severity, or, creating, rehabilitation, strategies, occupational, therapists, may, be, involved, in, running, rehabilitation, programs, to, help, restore, lost, function, or, help, re, learn, essential, skills, registered, nurses, such, as, those, working, in, hospital, intensive, care, units, are, able, to, maintain, the, health, of, the, severely, brain, injured, with, constant, administration, of, medication, and, neurological, monitoring, including, the, use, of, the, glasgow, coma, scale, used, by, other, health, professionals, to, quantify, extent, of, orientation, physiotherapists, also, play, a, significant, role, in, rehabilitation, after, a, brain, injury, in, the, case, of, a, traumatic, brain, injury, tbi, physiotherapy, treatment, during, the, post, acute, phase, may, include, sensory, stimulation, serial, casting, and, splinting, fitness, and, aerobic, training, and, functional, training, sensory, stimulation, refers, to, regaining, sensory, perception, through, the, use, of, modalities, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, the, efficacy, of, this, intervention, serial, casting, and, splinting, are, often, used, to, reduce, soft, tissue, contractures, and, muscle, tone, evidence, based, research, reveals, that, serial, casting, can, be, used, to, increase, passive, range, of, motion, prom, and, decrease, spasticity, functional, training, may, also, be, used, to, treat, patients, with, tbis, to, date, no, studies, supports, the, efficacy, of, sit, to, stand, training, arm, ability, training, and, body, weight, support, systems, bws, overall, studies, suggest, that, patients, with, tbis, who, participate, in, more, intense, rehabilitation, programs, will, see, greater, benefits, in, functional, skills, more, research, is, required, to, better, understand, the, efficacy, of, the, treatments, mentioned, above, other, treatments, for, brain, injury, can, include, medication, psychotherapy, neuropsychological, rehabilitation, and, or, surgery, prognosis, or, the, likely, progress, of, a, disorder, depends, on, the, nature, location, and, cause, of, the, brain, damage, see, traumatic, brain, injury, focal, and, diffuse, brain, injury, primary, and, secondary, brain, injury, in, general, neuroregeneration, can, occur, in, the, peripheral, nervous, system, but, is, much, rarer, and, more, difficult, to, assist, in, the, central, nervous, system, brain, or, spinal, cord, however, in, neural, development, in, humans, areas, of, the, brain, can, learn, to, compensate, for, other, damaged, areas, and, may, increase, in, size, and, complexity, and, even, change, function, just, as, someone, who, loses, a, sense, may, gain, increased, acuity, in, another, sense, a, process, termed, neuroplasticity, there, are, many, misconceptions, that, revolve, around, brain, injuries, and, brain, damage, one, misconception, is, that, if, someone, has, brain, damage, then, they, cannot, fully, recover, recovery, depends, a, variety, of, factors, such, as, severity, and, location, testing, is, done, to, note, severity, and, location, not, everyone, fully, heals, from, brain, damage, but, it, is, possible, to, have, a, full, recovery, brain, injuries, are, very, hard, to, predict, in, outcome, many, tests, and, specialists, are, needed, to, determine, the, likelihood, of, the, prognosis, people, with, minor, brain, damage, can, have, debilitating, side, effects, not, just, severe, brain, damage, has, debilitating, effects, the, side, effects, of, a, brain, injury, depend, on, location, and, the, body, s, response, to, injury, even, a, mild, concussion, can, have, long, term, effects, that, may, not, resolve, another, misconception, is, that, children, heal, better, from, brain, damage, children, are, at, greater, risk, for, injury, due, to, lack, of, maturity, it, makes, future, development, hard, to, predict, this, is, because, different, cortical, areas, mature, at, different, stages, with, some, major, cell, populations, and, their, corresponding, cognitive, faculties, remaining, unrefined, until, early, adulthood, in, the, case, of, a, child, with, frontal, brain, injury, for, example, the, impact, of, the, damage, may, be, undetectable, until, that, child, fails, to, develop, normal, executive, functions, in, his, or, her, late, teens, and, early, twenties, the, foundation, for, understanding, human, behavior, and, brain, injury, can, be, attributed, to, the, case, of, phineas, gage, and, the, famous, case, studies, by, paul, broca, the, first, case, study, on, phineas, gage, s, head, injury, is, one, of, the, most, astonishing, brain, injuries, in, history, in, 1848, phineas, gage, was, paving, way, for, a, new, railroad, line, when, he, encountered, an, accidental, explosion, of, a, tamping, iron, straight, through, his, frontal, lobe, gage, observed, to, be, intellectually, unaffected, but, was, claimed, by, some, to, have, exemplified, post, injury, behavioral, deficits, ten, years, later, paul, broca, examined, two, patients, exhibiting, impaired, speech, due, to, frontal, lobe, injuries, broca, s, first, patient, lacked, productive, speech, he, saw, this, as, an, opportunity, to, address, language, localization, it, was, not, until, leborgne, informally, known, as, tan, died, when, broca, confirmed, the, frontal, lobe, lesion, from, an, autopsy, the, second, patient, had, similar, speech, impairments, supporting, his, findings, on, language, localization, the, results, of, both, cases, became, a, vital, verification, of, the, relationship, between, speech, and, the, left, cerebral, hemisphere, the, affected, areas, are, known, today, as, broca, s, area, and, broca, s, aphasia, a, few, years, later, a, german, neuroscientist, carl, wernicke, consulted, on, a, stroke, patient, the, patient, experienced, neither, speech, nor, hearing, impairments, but, had, a, few, brain, deficits, these, deficits, included, lacking, the, ability, to, comprehend, what, was, spoken, to, him, and, the, words, written, down, after, his, death, wernicke, examined, his, autopsy, that, found, a, lesion, located, in, the, left, temporal, region, this, area, became, known, as, wernicke, s, area, wernicke, later, hypothesized, the, relationship, between, wernicke, s, area, and, broca, s, area, which, was, proven, fact
