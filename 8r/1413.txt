influenza, commonly, known, as, the, flu, or, just, flu, is, an, infectious, disease, caused, by, influenza, viruses, symptoms, range, from, mild, to, severe, and, often, include, fever, runny, nose, sore, throat, muscle, pain, headache, coughing, and, fatigue, these, symptoms, begin, one, to, four, typically, two, days, after, exposure, to, the, virus, and, last, for, about, two, to, eight, days, diarrhea, and, vomiting, can, occur, particularly, in, children, influenza, may, progress, to, pneumonia, from, the, virus, or, a, subsequent, bacterial, infection, other, complications, include, acute, respiratory, distress, syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, and, worsening, of, pre, existing, health, problems, such, as, asthma, and, cardiovascular, disease, there, are, four, types, of, influenza, virus, types, a, b, c, and, d, aquatic, birds, are, the, primary, source, of, influenza, a, virus, iav, which, is, also, widespread, in, various, mammals, including, humans, and, pigs, influenza, b, virus, ibv, and, influenza, c, virus, icv, primarily, infect, humans, and, influenza, d, virus, idv, is, found, in, cattle, and, pigs, influenza, a, virus, and, influenza, b, virus, circulate, in, humans, and, cause, seasonal, epidemics, and, influenza, c, virus, causes, a, mild, infection, primarily, in, children, influenza, d, virus, can, infect, humans, but, is, not, known, to, cause, illness, in, humans, influenza, viruses, are, primarily, transmitted, through, respiratory, droplets, from, coughing, and, sneezing, transmission, through, aerosols, and, surfaces, contaminated, by, the, virus, also, occur, frequent, hand, washing, and, covering, one, s, mouth, and, nose, when, coughing, and, sneezing, reduce, transmission, annual, vaccination, can, help, to, provide, protection, against, influenza, influenza, viruses, particularly, influenza, a, virus, evolve, quickly, so, flu, vaccines, are, updated, regularly, to, match, which, influenza, strains, are, in, circulation, vaccines, provide, protection, against, influenza, a, virus, subtypes, h1n1, and, h3n2, and, one, or, two, influenza, b, virus, subtypes, influenza, infection, is, diagnosed, with, laboratory, methods, such, as, antibody, or, antigen, tests, and, a, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, to, identify, viral, nucleic, acid, the, disease, can, be, treated, with, supportive, measures, and, in, severe, cases, with, antiviral, drugs, such, as, oseltamivir, in, healthy, individuals, influenza, is, typically, self, limiting, and, rarely, fatal, but, it, can, be, deadly, in, high, risk, groups, in, a, typical, year, five, to, 15, percent, of, the, population, contracts, influenza, there, are, 3, to, 5, million, severe, cases, annually, with, up, to, 650, 000, respiratory, related, deaths, globally, each, year, deaths, most, commonly, occur, in, high, risk, groups, including, young, children, the, elderly, and, people, with, chronic, health, conditions, in, temperate, regions, the, number, of, influenza, cases, peaks, during, winter, whereas, in, the, tropics, influenza, can, occur, year, round, since, the, late, 1800s, pandemic, outbreaks, of, novel, influenza, strains, have, occurred, every, 10, to, 50, years, five, flu, pandemics, have, occurred, since, 1900, the, spanish, flu, from, 1918, to, 1920, which, was, the, most, severe, the, asian, flu, in, 1957, the, hong, kong, flu, in, 1968, the, russian, flu, in, 1977, and, the, swine, flu, pandemic, in, 2009, the, symptoms, of, influenza, are, similar, to, those, of, a, cold, although, usually, more, severe, and, less, likely, to, include, a, runny, nose, the, time, between, exposure, to, the, virus, and, development, of, symptoms, the, incubation, period, is, one, to, four, days, most, commonly, one, to, two, days, many, infections, are, asymptomatic, the, onset, of, symptoms, is, sudden, and, initial, symptoms, are, predominately, non, specific, including, fever, chills, headaches, muscle, pain, malaise, loss, of, appetite, lack, of, energy, and, confusion, these, are, usually, accompanied, by, respiratory, symptoms, such, as, a, dry, cough, sore, or, dry, throat, hoarse, voice, and, a, stuffy, or, runny, nose, coughing, is, the, most, common, symptom, gastrointestinal, symptoms, may, also, occur, including, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and, gastroenteritis, especially, in, children, the, standard, influenza, symptoms, typically, last, for, two, to, eight, days, some, studies, suggest, influenza, can, cause, long, lasting, symptoms, in, a, similar, way, to, long, covid, symptomatic, infections, are, usually, mild, and, limited, to, the, upper, respiratory, tract, but, progression, to, pneumonia, is, relatively, common, pneumonia, may, be, caused, by, the, primary, viral, infection, or, a, secondary, bacterial, infection, primary, pneumonia, is, characterized, by, rapid, progression, of, fever, cough, labored, breathing, and, low, oxygen, levels, that, cause, bluish, skin, it, is, especially, common, among, those, who, have, an, underlying, cardiovascular, disease, such, as, rheumatic, heart, disease, secondary, pneumonia, typically, has, a, period, of, improvement, in, symptoms, for, one, to, three, weeks, followed, by, recurrent, fever, sputum, production, and, fluid, buildup, in, the, lungs, but, can, also, occur, just, a, few, days, after, influenza, symptoms, appear, about, a, third, of, primary, pneumonia, cases, are, followed, by, secondary, pneumonia, which, is, most, frequently, caused, by, the, bacteria, streptococcus, pneumoniae, and, staphylococcus, aureus, influenza, viruses, comprise, four, species, each, the, sole, member, of, its, own, genus, the, four, influenza, genera, comprise, four, of, the, seven, genera, in, the, family, orthomyxoviridae, they, are, influenza, a, virus, is, responsible, for, most, cases, of, severe, illness, as, well, as, seasonal, epidemics, and, occasional, pandemics, it, infects, people, of, all, ages, but, tends, to, disproportionately, cause, severe, illness, in, the, elderly, the, very, young, and, those, with, chronic, health, issues, birds, are, the, primary, reservoir, of, influenza, a, virus, especially, aquatic, birds, such, as, ducks, geese, shorebirds, and, gulls, but, the, virus, also, circulates, among, mammals, including, pigs, horses, and, marine, mammals, subtypes, of, influenza, a, are, defined, by, the, combination, of, the, antigenic, viral, proteins, haemagglutinin, h, and, neuraminidase, n, in, the, viral, envelope, for, example, h1n1, designates, an, iav, subtype, that, has, a, type, 1, hemagglutinin, h, protein, and, a, type, 1, neuraminidase, n, protein, almost, all, possible, combinations, of, h, 1, thru, 16, and, n, 1, thru, 11, have, been, isolated, from, wild, birds, in, addition, h17, h18, n10, and, n11, have, been, found, in, bats, the, influenza, a, virus, subtypes, in, circulation, among, humans, as, of, 2018, are, h1n1, and, h3n2, influenza, b, virus, mainly, infects, humans, but, has, been, identified, in, seals, horses, dogs, and, pigs, influenza, b, virus, does, not, have, subtypes, like, influenza, a, virus, but, has, two, antigenically, distinct, lineages, termed, the, b, victoria, 2, 1987, like, and, b, yamagata, 16, 1988, like, lineages, or, simply, b, victoria, like, and, b, yamagata, like, both, lineages, are, in, circulation, in, humans, disproportionately, affecting, children, however, the, b, yamagata, lineage, might, have, become, extinct, in, 2020, 2021, due, to, covid, 19, pandemic, measures, influenza, b, viruses, contribute, to, seasonal, epidemics, alongside, influenza, a, viruses, but, have, never, been, associated, with, a, pandemic, influenza, c, virus, like, influenza, b, virus, is, primarily, found, in, humans, though, it, has, been, detected, in, pigs, feral, dogs, dromedary, camels, cattle, and, dogs, influenza, c, virus, infection, primarily, affects, children, and, is, usually, asymptomatic, or, has, mild, cold, like, symptoms, though, more, severe, symptoms, such, as, gastroenteritis, and, pneumonia, can, occur, unlike, influenza, a, virus, and, influenza, b, virus, influenza, c, virus, has, not, been, a, major, focus, of, research, pertaining, to, antiviral, drugs, vaccines, and, other, measures, against, influenza, influenza, c, virus, is, subclassified, into, six, genetic, antigenic, lineages, influenza, d, virus, has, been, isolated, from, pigs, and, cattle, the, latter, being, the, natural, reservoir, infection, has, also, been, observed, in, humans, horses, dromedary, camels, and, small, ruminants, such, as, goats, and, sheep, influenza, d, virus, is, distantly, related, to, influenza, c, virus, while, cattle, workers, have, occasionally, tested, positive, to, prior, influenza, d, virus, infection, it, is, not, known, to, cause, disease, in, humans, influenza, c, virus, and, influenza, d, virus, experience, a, slower, rate, of, antigenic, evolution, than, influenza, a, virus, and, influenza, b, virus, because, of, this, antigenic, stability, relatively, few, novel, lineages, emerge, every, year, millions, of, influenza, virus, samples, are, analysed, to, monitor, changes, in, the, virus, antigenic, properties, and, to, inform, the, development, of, vaccines, to, unambiguously, describe, a, specific, isolate, of, virus, researchers, use, the, internationally, accepted, influenza, virus, nomenclature, i, which, describes, among, other, things, the, species, of, animal, from, which, the, virus, was, isolated, and, the, place, and, year, of, collection, as, an, example, a, chicken, nakorn, patom, thailand, cu, k2, 04, h5n1, the, nomenclature, for, influenza, b, c, and, d, which, are, less, variable, is, simpler, examples, are, b, santiago, 29615, 2020, and, c, minnesota, 10, 2015, influenza, viruses, have, a, negative, sense, single, stranded, rna, genome, that, is, segmented, the, negative, sense, of, the, genome, means, it, can, be, used, as, a, template, to, synthesize, messenger, rna, mrna, influenza, a, virus, and, influenza, b, virus, have, eight, genome, segments, that, encode, 10, major, proteins, influenza, c, virus, and, influenza, d, virus, have, seven, genome, segments, that, encode, nine, major, proteins, three, segments, encode, three, subunits, of, an, rna, dependent, rna, polymerase, rdrp, complex, pb1, a, transcriptase, pb2, which, recognizes, 5, caps, and, pa, p3, for, influenza, c, virus, and, influenza, d, virus, an, endonuclease, the, m1, matrix, protein, and, m2, proton, channel, share, a, segment, as, do, the, non, structural, protein, ns1, and, the, nuclear, export, protein, nep, for, influenza, a, virus, and, influenza, b, virus, hemagglutinin, ha, and, neuraminidase, na, are, encoded, on, one, segment, each, whereas, influenza, c, virus, and, influenza, d, virus, encode, a, hemagglutinin, esterase, fusion, hef, protein, on, one, segment, that, merges, the, functions, of, ha, and, na, the, final, genome, segment, encodes, the, viral, nucleoprotein, np, influenza, viruses, also, encode, various, accessory, proteins, such, as, pb1, f2, and, pa, x, that, are, expressed, through, alternative, open, reading, frames, and, which, are, important, in, host, defense, suppression, virulence, and, pathogenicity, the, virus, particle, called, a, virion, is, pleomorphic, and, varies, between, being, filamentous, bacilliform, or, spherical, in, shape, clinical, isolates, tend, to, be, pleomorphic, whereas, strains, adapted, to, laboratory, growth, typically, produce, spherical, virions, filamentous, virions, are, about, 250, nanometers, nm, by, 80, nm, bacilliform, 120, 250, by, 95, nm, and, spherical, 120, nm, in, diameter, the, core, of, the, virion, comprises, one, copy, of, each, segment, of, the, genome, bound, to, np, nucleoproteins, in, separate, ribonucleoprotein, rnp, complexes, for, each, segment, there, is, a, copy, of, the, rdrp, all, subunits, included, bound, to, each, rnp, the, genetic, material, is, encapsulated, by, a, layer, of, m1, matrix, protein, which, provides, structural, reinforcement, to, the, outer, layer, the, viral, envelope, the, envelope, comprises, a, lipid, bilayer, membrane, incorporating, ha, and, na, or, hef, proteins, extending, outward, from, its, exterior, surface, ha, and, hef, proteins, have, a, distinct, head, and, stalk, structure, m2, proteins, form, proton, channels, through, the, viral, envelope, that, are, required, for, viral, entry, and, exit, influenza, b, viruses, contain, a, surface, protein, named, nb, that, is, anchored, in, the, envelope, but, its, function, is, unknown, the, viral, life, cycle, begins, by, binding, to, a, target, cell, binding, is, mediated, by, the, viral, ha, proteins, on, the, surface, of, the, envelope, which, bind, to, cells, that, contain, sialic, acid, receptors, on, the, surface, of, the, cell, membrane, for, n1, subtypes, with, the, g147r, mutation, and, n2, subtypes, the, na, protein, can, initiate, entry, prior, to, binding, na, proteins, promote, access, to, target, cells, by, degrading, mucus, which, helps, to, remove, extracellular, decoy, receptors, that, would, impede, access, to, target, cells, after, binding, the, virus, is, internalized, into, the, cell, by, an, endosome, that, contains, the, virion, inside, it, the, endosome, is, acidified, by, cellular, vatpase, to, have, lower, ph, which, triggers, a, conformational, change, in, ha, that, allows, fusion, of, the, viral, envelope, with, the, endosomal, membrane, at, the, same, time, hydrogen, ions, diffuse, into, the, virion, through, m2, ion, channels, disrupting, internal, protein, protein, interactions, to, release, rnps, into, the, host, cell, s, cytosol, the, m1, protein, shell, surrounding, rnps, is, degraded, fully, uncoating, rnps, in, the, cytosol, rnps, are, then, imported, into, the, nucleus, with, the, help, of, viral, localization, signals, there, the, viral, rna, polymerase, transcribes, mrna, using, the, genomic, negative, sense, strand, as, a, template, the, polymerase, snatches, 5, caps, for, viral, mrna, from, cellular, rna, to, prime, mrna, synthesis, and, the, 3, end, of, mrna, is, polyadenylated, at, the, end, of, transcription, once, viral, mrna, is, transcribed, it, is, exported, out, of, the, nucleus, and, translated, by, host, ribosomes, in, a, cap, dependent, manner, to, synthesize, viral, proteins, rdrp, also, synthesizes, complementary, positive, sense, strands, of, the, viral, genome, in, a, complementary, rnp, complex, which, are, then, used, as, templates, by, viral, polymerases, to, synthesize, copies, of, the, negative, sense, genome, during, these, processes, rdrps, of, avian, influenza, viruses, aivs, function, optimally, at, a, higher, temperature, than, mammalian, influenza, viruses, newly, synthesized, viral, polymerase, subunits, and, np, proteins, are, imported, to, the, nucleus, to, further, increase, the, rate, of, viral, replication, and, form, rnps, ha, na, and, m2, proteins, are, trafficked, with, the, aid, of, m1, and, nep, proteins, to, the, cell, membrane, through, the, golgi, apparatus, and, inserted, into, the, cell, s, membrane, viral, non, structural, proteins, including, ns1, pb1, f2, and, pa, x, regulate, host, cellular, processes, to, disable, antiviral, responses, pb1, f2, also, interacts, with, pb1, to, keep, polymerases, in, the, nucleus, longer, m1, and, nep, proteins, localize, to, the, nucleus, during, the, later, stages, of, infection, bind, to, viral, rnps, and, mediate, their, export, to, the, cytoplasm, where, they, migrate, to, the, cell, membrane, with, the, aid, of, recycled, endosomes, and, are, bundled, into, the, segments, of, the, genome, progeny, viruses, leave, the, cell, by, budding, from, the, cell, membrane, which, is, initiated, by, the, accumulation, of, m1, proteins, at, the, cytoplasmic, side, of, the, membrane, the, viral, genome, is, incorporated, inside, a, viral, envelope, derived, from, portions, of, the, cell, membrane, that, have, ha, na, and, m2, proteins, at, the, end, of, budding, ha, proteins, remain, attached, to, cellular, sialic, acid, until, they, are, cleaved, by, the, sialidase, activity, of, na, proteins, the, virion, is, then, released, from, the, cell, the, sialidase, activity, of, na, also, cleaves, any, sialic, acid, residues, from, the, viral, surface, which, helps, prevent, newly, assembled, viruses, from, aggregating, near, the, cell, surface, and, improving, infectivity, similar, to, other, aspects, of, influenza, replication, optimal, na, activity, is, temperature, and, ph, dependent, ultimately, presence, of, large, quantities, of, viral, rna, in, the, cell, triggers, apoptosis, programmed, cell, death, which, is, initiated, by, cellular, factors, to, restrict, viral, replication, two, key, processes, that, influenza, viruses, evolve, through, are, antigenic, drift, and, antigenic, shift, antigenic, drift, is, when, an, influenza, virus, antigens, change, due, to, the, gradual, accumulation, of, mutations, in, the, antigen, s, ha, or, na, gene, this, can, occur, in, response, to, evolutionary, pressure, exerted, by, the, host, immune, response, antigenic, drift, is, especially, common, for, the, ha, protein, in, which, just, a, few, amino, acid, changes, in, the, head, region, can, constitute, antigenic, drift, the, result, is, the, production, of, novel, strains, that, can, evade, pre, existing, antibody, mediated, immunity, antigenic, drift, occurs, in, all, influenza, species, but, is, slower, in, b, than, a, and, slowest, in, c, and, d, antigenic, drift, is, a, major, cause, of, seasonal, influenza, and, requires, that, flu, vaccines, be, updated, annually, ha, is, the, main, component, of, inactivated, vaccines, so, surveillance, monitors, antigenic, drift, of, this, antigen, among, circulating, strains, antigenic, evolution, of, influenza, viruses, of, humans, appears, to, be, faster, than, in, swine, and, equines, in, wild, birds, within, subtype, antigenic, variation, appears, to, be, limited, but, has, been, observed, in, poultry, antigenic, shift, is, a, sudden, drastic, change, in, an, influenza, virus, antigen, usually, ha, during, antigenic, shift, antigenically, different, strains, that, infect, the, same, cell, can, reassort, genome, segments, with, each, other, producing, hybrid, progeny, since, all, influenza, viruses, have, segmented, genomes, all, are, capable, of, reassortment, antigenic, shift, only, occurs, among, influenza, viruses, of, the, same, genus, and, most, commonly, occurs, among, influenza, a, viruses, in, particular, reassortment, is, very, common, in, aivs, creating, a, large, diversity, of, influenza, viruses, in, birds, but, is, uncommon, in, human, equine, and, canine, lineages, pigs, bats, and, quails, have, receptors, for, both, mammalian, and, avian, influenza, a, viruses, so, they, are, potential, mixing, vessels, for, reassortment, if, an, animal, strain, reassorts, with, a, human, strain, then, a, novel, strain, can, emerge, that, is, capable, of, human, to, human, transmission, this, has, caused, pandemics, but, only, a, limited, number, so, it, is, difficult, to, predict, when, the, next, will, happen, the, global, influenza, surveillance, and, response, system, of, the, world, health, organization, gisrs, tests, several, millions, of, specimens, annually, to, monitor, the, spread, and, evolution, of, influenza, viruses, people, who, are, infected, can, transmit, influenza, viruses, through, breathing, talking, coughing, and, sneezing, which, spread, respiratory, droplets, and, aerosols, that, contain, virus, particles, into, the, air, a, person, susceptible, to, infection, can, contract, influenza, by, coming, into, contact, with, these, particles, respiratory, droplets, are, relatively, large, and, travel, less, than, two, meters, before, falling, onto, nearby, surfaces, aerosols, are, smaller, and, remain, suspended, in, the, air, longer, so, they, take, longer, to, settle, and, can, travel, further, inhalation, of, aerosols, can, lead, to, infection, but, most, transmission, is, in, the, area, about, two, meters, around, an, infected, person, via, respiratory, droplets, that, come, into, contact, with, mucosa, of, the, upper, respiratory, tract, transmission, through, contact, with, a, person, bodily, fluids, or, intermediate, objects, fomites, can, also, occur, since, influenza, viruses, can, survive, for, hours, on, non, porous, surfaces, if, one, s, hands, are, contaminated, then, touching, one, s, face, can, cause, infection, influenza, is, usually, transmissible, from, one, day, before, the, onset, of, symptoms, to, 5, 7, days, after, in, healthy, adults, the, virus, is, shed, for, up, to, 3, 5, days, in, children, and, the, immunocompromised, the, virus, may, be, transmissible, for, several, weeks, children, ages, 2, 17, are, considered, to, be, the, primary, and, most, efficient, spreaders, of, influenza, children, who, have, not, had, multiple, prior, exposures, to, influenza, viruses, shed, the, virus, at, greater, quantities, and, for, a, longer, duration, than, other, children, people, at, risk, of, exposure, to, influenza, include, health, care, workers, social, care, workers, and, those, who, live, with, or, care, for, people, vulnerable, to, influenza, in, long, term, care, facilities, the, flu, can, spread, rapidly, a, variety, of, factors, likely, encourage, influenza, transmission, including, lower, temperature, lower, absolute, and, relative, humidity, less, ultraviolet, radiation, from, the, sun, and, crowding, influenza, viruses, that, infect, the, upper, respiratory, tract, like, h1n1, tend, to, be, more, mild, but, more, transmissible, whereas, those, that, infect, the, lower, respiratory, tract, like, h5n1, tend, to, cause, more, severe, illness, but, are, less, contagious, in, humans, influenza, viruses, first, cause, infection, by, infecting, epithelial, cells, in, the, respiratory, tract, illness, during, infection, is, primarily, the, result, of, lung, inflammation, and, compromise, caused, by, epithelial, cell, infection, and, death, combined, with, inflammation, caused, by, the, immune, system, s, response, to, infection, non, respiratory, organs, can, become, involved, but, the, mechanisms, by, which, influenza, is, involved, in, these, cases, are, unknown, severe, respiratory, illness, can, be, caused, by, multiple, non, exclusive, mechanisms, including, obstruction, of, the, airways, loss, of, alveolar, structure, loss, of, lung, epithelial, integrity, due, to, epithelial, cell, infection, and, death, and, degradation, of, the, extracellular, matrix, that, maintains, lung, structure, in, particular, alveolar, cell, infection, appears, to, drive, severe, symptoms, since, this, results, in, impaired, gas, exchange, and, enables, viruses, to, infect, endothelial, cells, which, produce, large, quantities, of, pro, inflammatory, cytokines, pneumonia, caused, by, influenza, viruses, is, characterized, by, high, levels, of, viral, replication, in, the, lower, respiratory, tract, accompanied, by, a, strong, pro, inflammatory, response, called, a, cytokine, storm, infection, with, h5n1, or, h7n9, especially, produces, high, levels, of, pro, inflammatory, cytokines, in, bacterial, infections, early, depletion, of, macrophages, during, influenza, creates, a, favorable, environment, in, the, lungs, for, bacterial, growth, since, these, white, blood, cells, are, important, in, responding, to, bacterial, infection, host, mechanisms, to, encourage, tissue, repair, may, inadvertently, allow, bacterial, infection, infection, also, induces, production, of, systemic, glucocorticoids, that, can, reduce, inflammation, to, preserve, tissue, integrity, but, allow, increased, bacterial, growth, the, pathophysiology, of, influenza, is, significantly, influenced, by, which, receptors, influenza, viruses, bind, to, during, entry, into, cells, mammalian, influenza, viruses, preferentially, bind, to, sialic, acids, connected, to, the, rest, of, the, oligosaccharide, by, an, 2, 6, link, most, commonly, found, in, various, respiratory, cells, such, as, respiratory, and, retinal, epithelial, cells, aivs, prefer, sialic, acids, with, an, 2, 3, linkage, which, are, most, common, in, birds, in, gastrointestinal, epithelial, cells, and, in, humans, in, the, lower, respiratory, tract, cleavage, of, the, ha, protein, into, ha, 1, the, binding, subunit, and, ha, 2, the, fusion, subunit, is, performed, by, different, proteases, affecting, which, cells, can, be, infected, for, mammalian, influenza, viruses, and, low, pathogenic, aivs, cleavage, is, extracellular, which, limits, infection, to, cells, that, have, the, appropriate, proteases, whereas, for, highly, pathogenic, aivs, cleavage, is, intracellular, and, performed, by, ubiquitous, proteases, which, allows, for, infection, of, a, greater, variety, of, cells, thereby, contributing, to, more, severe, disease, cells, possess, sensors, to, detect, viral, rna, which, can, then, induce, interferon, production, interferons, mediate, expression, of, antiviral, proteins, and, proteins, that, recruit, immune, cells, to, the, infection, site, and, they, notify, nearby, uninfected, cells, of, infection, some, infected, cells, release, pro, inflammatory, cytokines, that, recruit, immune, cells, to, the, site, of, infection, immune, cells, control, viral, infection, by, killing, infected, cells, and, phagocytizing, viral, particles, and, apoptotic, cells, an, exacerbated, immune, response, can, harm, the, host, organism, through, a, cytokine, storm, to, counter, the, immune, response, influenza, viruses, encode, various, non, structural, proteins, including, ns1, nep, pb1, f2, and, pa, x, that, are, involved, in, curtailing, the, host, immune, response, by, suppressing, interferon, production, and, host, gene, expression, b, cells, a, type, of, white, blood, cell, produce, antibodies, that, bind, to, influenza, antigens, ha, and, na, or, hef, and, other, proteins, to, a, lesser, degree, once, bound, to, these, proteins, antibodies, block, virions, from, binding, to, cellular, receptors, neutralizing, the, virus, in, humans, a, sizeable, antibody, response, occurs, about, one, week, after, viral, exposure, this, antibody, response, is, typically, robust, and, long, lasting, especially, for, influenza, c, virus, and, influenza, d, virus, people, exposed, to, a, certain, strain, in, childhood, still, possess, antibodies, to, that, strain, at, a, reasonable, level, later, in, life, which, can, provide, some, protection, to, related, strains, there, is, however, an, original, antigenic, sin, in, which, the, first, ha, subtype, a, person, is, exposed, to, influences, the, antibody, based, immune, response, to, future, infections, and, vaccines, annual, vaccination, is, the, primary, and, most, effective, way, to, prevent, influenza, and, influenza, associated, complications, especially, for, high, risk, groups, vaccines, against, the, flu, are, trivalent, or, quadrivalent, providing, protection, against, an, h1n1, strain, an, h3n2, strain, and, one, or, two, influenza, b, virus, strains, corresponding, to, the, two, influenza, b, virus, lineages, two, types, of, vaccines, are, in, use, inactivated, vaccines, that, contain, killed, i, e, inactivated, viruses, and, live, attenuated, influenza, vaccines, laivs, that, contain, weakened, viruses, there, are, three, types, of, inactivated, vaccines, whole, virus, split, virus, in, which, the, virus, is, disrupted, by, a, detergent, and, subunit, which, only, contains, the, viral, antigens, ha, and, na, most, flu, vaccines, are, inactivated, and, administered, via, intramuscular, injection, laivs, are, sprayed, into, the, nasal, cavity, vaccination, recommendations, vary, by, country, some, recommend, vaccination, for, all, people, above, a, certain, age, such, as, 6, months, whereas, other, countries, limit, recommendations, to, high, risk, groups, young, infants, cannot, receive, flu, vaccines, for, safety, reasons, but, they, can, inherit, passive, immunity, from, their, mother, if, vaccinated, during, pregnancy, influenza, vaccination, helps, to, reduce, the, probability, of, reassortment, in, general, influenza, vaccines, are, only, effective, if, there, is, an, antigenic, match, between, vaccine, strains, and, circulating, strains, most, commercially, available, flu, vaccines, are, manufactured, by, propagation, of, influenza, viruses, in, embryonated, chicken, eggs, taking, 6, 8, months, flu, seasons, are, different, in, the, northern, and, southern, hemisphere, so, the, who, meets, twice, a, year, once, for, each, hemisphere, to, discuss, which, strains, should, be, included, based, on, observation, from, ha, inhibition, assays, other, manufacturing, methods, include, an, mdck, cell, culture, based, inactivated, vaccine, and, a, recombinant, subunit, vaccine, manufactured, from, baculovirus, overexpression, in, insect, cells, influenza, can, be, prevented, or, reduced, in, severity, by, post, exposure, prophylaxis, with, the, antiviral, drugs, oseltamivir, which, can, be, taken, orally, by, those, at, least, three, months, old, and, zanamivir, which, can, be, inhaled, by, those, above, seven, years, chemoprophylaxis, is, most, useful, for, individuals, at, high, risk, for, complications, and, those, who, cannot, receive, the, flu, vaccine, post, exposure, chemoprophylaxis, is, only, recommended, if, oseltamivir, is, taken, within, 48, hours, of, contact, with, a, confirmed, or, suspected, case, and, zanamivir, within, 36, hours, it, is, recommended, for, people, who, have, yet, to, receive, a, vaccine, for, the, current, flu, season, who, have, been, vaccinated, less, than, two, week, since, contact, if, there, is, a, significant, mismatch, between, vaccine, and, circulating, strains, or, during, an, outbreak, in, a, closed, setting, regardless, of, vaccination, history, hand, hygiene, is, important, in, reducing, the, spread, of, influenza, this, includes, frequent, hand, washing, with, soap, and, water, using, alcohol, based, hand, sanitizers, and, not, touching, one, s, eyes, nose, and, mouth, with, one, s, hands, covering, one, s, nose, and, mouth, when, coughing, or, sneezing, is, important, other, methods, to, limit, influenza, transmission, include, staying, home, when, sick, avoiding, contact, with, others, until, one, day, after, symptoms, end, and, disinfecting, surfaces, likely, to, be, contaminated, by, the, virus, research, thus, far, has, not, shown, a, significant, reduction, in, seasonal, influenza, with, mask, usage, the, effectiveness, of, screening, at, points, of, entry, into, countries, is, not, well, researched, social, distancing, measures, such, as, school, closures, isolation, or, quarantine, and, limiting, mass, gatherings, may, reduce, transmission, but, these, measures, are, often, expensive, unpopular, and, difficult, to, implement, consequently, the, commonly, recommended, methods, of, infection, control, are, respiratory, etiquette, hand, hygiene, and, mask, wearing, which, are, inexpensive, and, easy, pharmaceutical, measures, are, effective, but, may, not, be, available, in, the, early, stages, of, an, outbreak, in, health, care, settings, infected, individuals, may, be, cohorted, or, assigned, to, individual, rooms, protective, clothing, such, as, masks, gloves, and, gowns, is, recommended, when, coming, into, contact, with, infected, individuals, if, there, is, a, risk, of, exposure, to, infected, bodily, fluids, keeping, patients, in, negative, pressure, rooms, and, avoiding, aerosol, producing, activities, may, help, but, special, air, handling, and, ventilation, systems, are, not, considered, necessary, to, prevent, the, spread, of, influenza, in, the, air, in, residential, homes, new, admissions, may, need, to, be, closed, until, the, spread, of, influenza, is, controlled, since, influenza, viruses, circulate, in, animals, such, as, birds, and, pigs, prevention, of, transmission, from, these, animals, is, important, water, treatment, indoor, raising, of, animals, quarantining, sick, animals, vaccination, and, biosecurity, are, the, primary, measures, used, placing, poultry, houses, and, piggeries, on, high, ground, away, from, high, density, farms, backyard, farms, live, poultry, markets, and, bodies, of, water, helps, to, minimize, contact, with, wild, birds, closure, of, live, poultry, markets, appears, to, the, most, effective, measure, and, has, shown, to, be, effective, at, controlling, the, spread, of, h5n1, h7n9, and, h9n2, other, biosecurity, measures, include, cleaning, and, disinfecting, facilities, and, vehicles, banning, visits, to, poultry, farms, not, bringing, birds, intended, for, slaughter, back, to, farms, changing, clothes, disinfecting, foot, baths, and, treating, food, and, water, if, live, poultry, markets, are, not, closed, then, clean, days, when, unsold, poultry, is, removed, and, facilities, are, disinfected, and, no, carry, over, policies, to, eliminate, infectious, material, before, new, poultry, arrive, can, be, used, to, reduce, the, spread, of, influenza, viruses, if, a, novel, influenza, viruses, has, breached, the, aforementioned, biosecurity, measures, then, rapid, detection, to, stamp, it, out, via, quarantining, decontamination, and, culling, may, be, necessary, to, prevent, the, virus, from, becoming, endemic, vaccines, exist, for, avian, h5, h7, and, h9, subtypes, that, are, used, in, some, countries, in, china, for, example, vaccination, of, domestic, birds, against, h7n9, successfully, limited, its, spread, indicating, that, vaccination, may, be, an, effective, strategy, if, used, in, combination, with, other, measures, to, limit, transmission, in, pigs, and, horses, management, of, influenza, is, dependent, on, vaccination, with, biosecurity, diagnosis, based, on, symptoms, is, fairly, accurate, in, otherwise, healthy, people, during, seasonal, epidemics, and, should, be, suspected, in, cases, of, pneumonia, acute, respiratory, distress, syndrome, ards, sepsis, or, if, encephalitis, myocarditis, or, breakdown, of, muscle, tissue, occur, because, influenza, is, similar, to, other, viral, respiratory, tract, illnesses, laboratory, diagnosis, is, necessary, for, confirmation, common, sample, collection, methods, for, testing, include, nasal, and, throat, swabs, samples, may, be, taken, from, the, lower, respiratory, tract, if, infection, has, cleared, the, upper, but, not, lower, respiratory, tract, influenza, testing, is, recommended, for, anyone, hospitalized, with, symptoms, resembling, influenza, during, flu, season, or, who, is, connected, to, an, influenza, case, for, severe, cases, earlier, diagnosis, improves, patient, outcome, diagnostic, methods, that, can, identify, influenza, include, viral, cultures, antibody, and, antigen, detecting, tests, and, nucleic, acid, based, tests, viruses, can, be, grown, in, a, culture, of, mammalian, cells, or, embryonated, eggs, for, 3, 10, days, to, monitor, cytopathic, effect, final, confirmation, can, then, be, done, via, antibody, staining, hemadsorption, using, red, blood, cells, or, immunofluorescence, microscopy, shell, vial, cultures, which, can, identify, infection, via, immunostaining, before, a, cytopathic, effect, appears, are, more, sensitive, than, traditional, cultures, with, results, in, 1, 3, days, cultures, can, be, used, to, characterize, novel, viruses, observe, sensitivity, to, antiviral, drugs, and, monitor, antigenic, drift, but, they, are, relatively, slow, and, require, specialized, skills, and, equipment, serological, assays, can, be, used, to, detect, an, antibody, response, to, influenza, after, natural, infection, or, vaccination, common, serological, assays, include, hemagglutination, inhibition, assays, that, detect, ha, specific, antibodies, virus, neutralization, assays, that, check, whether, antibodies, have, neutralized, the, virus, and, enzyme, linked, immunoabsorbant, assays, these, methods, tend, to, be, relatively, inexpensive, and, fast, but, are, less, reliable, than, nucleic, acid, based, tests, direct, fluorescent, or, immunofluorescent, antibody, dfa, ifa, tests, involve, staining, respiratory, epithelial, cells, in, samples, with, fluorescently, labeled, influenza, specific, antibodies, followed, by, examination, under, a, fluorescent, microscope, they, can, differentiate, between, influenza, a, virus, and, influenza, b, virus, but, can, not, subtype, influenza, a, virus, rapid, influenza, diagnostic, tests, ridts, are, a, simple, way, of, obtaining, assay, results, are, low, cost, and, produce, results, in, less, than, 30, minutes, so, they, are, commonly, used, but, they, can, not, distinguish, between, influenza, a, virus, and, influenza, b, virus, or, between, influenza, a, virus, subtypes, and, are, not, as, sensitive, as, nucleic, acid, based, tests, nucleic, acid, based, tests, nats, amplify, and, detect, viral, nucleic, acid, most, of, these, tests, take, a, few, hours, but, rapid, molecular, assays, are, as, fast, as, ridts, among, nats, reverse, transcription, polymerase, chain, reaction, rt, pcr, is, the, most, traditional, and, considered, the, gold, standard, for, diagnosing, influenza, because, it, is, fast, and, can, subtype, influenza, a, virus, but, it, is, relatively, expensive, and, more, prone, to, false, positives, than, cultures, other, nats, that, have, been, used, include, loop, mediated, isothermal, amplification, based, assays, simple, amplification, based, assays, and, nucleic, acid, sequence, based, amplification, nucleic, acid, sequencing, methods, can, identify, infection, by, obtaining, the, nucleic, acid, sequence, of, viral, samples, to, identify, the, virus, and, antiviral, drug, resistance, the, traditional, method, is, sanger, sequencing, but, it, has, been, largely, replaced, by, next, generation, methods, that, have, greater, sequencing, speed, and, throughput, treatment, in, cases, of, mild, or, moderate, illness, is, supportive, and, includes, anti, fever, medications, such, as, acetaminophen, and, ibuprofen, adequate, fluid, intake, to, avoid, dehydration, and, rest, cough, drops, and, throat, sprays, may, be, beneficial, for, sore, throat, it, is, recommended, to, avoid, alcohol, and, tobacco, use, while, ill, aspirin, is, not, recommended, to, treat, influenza, in, children, due, to, an, elevated, risk, of, developing, reye, syndrome, corticosteroids, are, not, recommended, except, when, treating, septic, shock, or, an, underlying, medical, condition, such, as, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, or, asthma, exacerbation, since, they, are, associated, with, increased, mortality, if, a, secondary, bacterial, infection, occurs, then, antibiotics, may, be, necessary, antiviral, drugs, are, primarily, used, to, treat, severely, ill, patients, especially, those, with, compromised, immune, systems, antivirals, are, most, effective, when, started, in, the, first, 48, hours, after, symptoms, appear, later, administration, may, still, be, beneficial, for, those, who, have, underlying, immune, defects, those, with, more, severe, symptoms, or, those, who, have, a, higher, risk, of, developing, complications, if, these, individuals, are, still, shedding, the, virus, antiviral, treatment, is, also, recommended, if, a, person, is, hospitalized, with, suspected, influenza, instead, of, waiting, for, test, results, to, return, and, if, symptoms, are, worsening, most, antiviral, drugs, against, influenza, fall, into, two, categories, neuraminidase, na, inhibitors, and, m2, inhibitors, baloxavir, marboxil, is, a, notable, exception, which, targets, the, endonuclease, activity, of, the, viral, rna, polymerase, and, can, be, used, as, an, alternative, to, na, and, m2, inhibitors, for, influenza, a, virus, and, influenza, b, virus, na, inhibitors, target, the, enzymatic, activity, of, na, receptors, mimicking, the, binding, of, sialic, acid, in, the, active, site, of, na, on, influenza, a, virus, and, influenza, b, virus, virions, so, that, viral, release, from, infected, cells, and, the, rate, of, viral, replication, are, impaired, na, inhibitors, include, oseltamivir, which, is, consumed, orally, in, a, prodrug, form, and, converted, to, its, active, form, in, the, liver, and, zanamivir, which, is, a, powder, that, is, inhaled, nasally, oseltamivir, and, zanamivir, are, effective, for, prophylaxis, and, post, exposure, prophylaxis, and, research, overall, indicates, that, na, inhibitors, are, effective, at, reducing, rates, of, complications, hospitalization, and, mortality, and, the, duration, of, illness, additionally, the, earlier, na, inhibitors, are, provided, the, better, the, outcome, though, late, administration, can, still, be, beneficial, in, severe, cases, other, na, inhibitors, include, laninamivir, and, peramivir, the, latter, of, which, can, be, used, as, an, alternative, to, oseltamivir, for, people, who, cannot, tolerate, or, absorb, it, the, adamantanes, amantadine, and, rimantadine, are, orally, administered, drugs, that, block, the, influenza, virus, m2, ion, channel, preventing, viral, uncoating, these, drugs, are, only, functional, against, influenza, a, virus, but, are, no, longer, recommended, for, use, because, of, widespread, resistance, to, them, among, influenza, a, viruses, adamantane, resistance, first, emerged, in, h3n2, in, 2003, becoming, worldwide, by, 2008, oseltamivir, resistance, is, no, longer, widespread, because, the, 2009, pandemic, h1n1, strain, h1n1, pdm09, which, is, resistant, to, adamantanes, seemingly, replaced, resistant, strains, in, circulation, since, the, 2009, pandemic, oseltamivir, resistance, has, mainly, been, observed, in, patients, undergoing, therapy, especially, the, immunocompromised, and, young, children, oseltamivir, resistance, is, usually, reported, in, h1n1, but, has, been, reported, in, h3n2, and, influenza, b, viruss, less, commonly, because, of, this, oseltamivir, is, recommended, as, the, first, drug, of, choice, for, immunocompetent, people, whereas, for, the, immunocompromised, oseltamivir, is, recommended, against, h3n2, and, influenza, b, virus, and, zanamivir, against, h1n1, pdm09, zanamivir, resistance, is, observed, less, frequently, and, resistance, to, peramivir, and, baloxavir, marboxil, is, possible, in, healthy, individuals, influenza, infection, is, usually, self, limiting, and, rarely, fatal, symptoms, usually, last, for, 2, 8, days, influenza, can, cause, people, to, miss, work, or, school, and, it, is, associated, with, decreased, job, performance, and, in, older, adults, reduced, independence, fatigue, and, malaise, may, last, for, several, weeks, after, recovery, and, healthy, adults, may, experience, pulmonary, abnormalities, that, can, take, several, weeks, to, resolve, complications, and, mortality, primarily, occur, in, high, risk, populations, and, those, who, are, hospitalized, severe, disease, and, mortality, are, usually, attributable, to, pneumonia, from, the, primary, viral, infection, or, a, secondary, bacterial, infection, which, can, progress, to, ards, other, respiratory, complications, that, may, occur, include, sinusitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, excess, fluid, buildup, in, the, lungs, and, exacerbation, of, chronic, bronchitis, and, asthma, middle, ear, infection, and, croup, may, occur, most, commonly, in, children, secondary, s, aureus, infection, has, been, observed, primarily, in, children, to, cause, toxic, shock, syndrome, after, influenza, with, hypotension, fever, and, reddening, and, peeling, of, the, skin, complications, affecting, the, cardiovascular, system, are, rare, and, include, pericarditis, fulminant, myocarditis, with, a, fast, slow, or, irregular, heartbeat, and, exacerbation, of, pre, existing, cardiovascular, disease, inflammation, or, swelling, of, muscles, accompanied, by, muscle, tissue, breaking, down, occurs, rarely, usually, in, children, which, presents, as, extreme, tenderness, and, muscle, pain, in, the, legs, and, a, reluctance, to, walk, for, 2, 3, days, influenza, can, affect, pregnancy, including, causing, smaller, neonatal, size, increased, risk, of, premature, birth, and, an, increased, risk, of, child, death, shortly, before, or, after, birth, neurological, complications, have, been, associated, with, influenza, on, rare, occasions, including, aseptic, meningitis, encephalitis, disseminated, encephalomyelitis, transverse, myelitis, and, guillain, barr, syndrome, additionally, febrile, seizures, and, reye, syndrome, can, occur, most, commonly, in, children, influenza, associated, encephalopathy, can, occur, directly, from, central, nervous, system, infection, from, the, presence, of, the, virus, in, blood, and, presents, as, sudden, onset, of, fever, with, convulsions, followed, by, rapid, progression, to, coma, an, atypical, form, of, encephalitis, called, encephalitis, lethargica, characterized, by, headache, drowsiness, and, coma, may, rarely, occur, sometime, after, infection, in, survivors, of, influenza, associated, encephalopathy, neurological, defects, may, occur, primarily, in, children, in, severe, cases, the, immune, system, may, rarely, dramatically, overproduce, white, blood, cells, that, release, cytokines, causing, severe, inflammation, people, who, are, at, least, 65, years, of, age, due, to, a, weakened, immune, system, from, aging, or, a, chronic, illness, are, a, high, risk, group, for, developing, complications, as, are, children, less, than, one, year, of, age, and, children, who, have, not, been, previously, exposed, to, influenza, viruses, multiple, times, pregnant, women, are, at, an, elevated, risk, which, increases, by, trimester, and, lasts, up, to, two, weeks, after, childbirth, obesity, in, particular, a, body, mass, index, greater, than, 35, 40, is, associated, with, greater, amounts, of, viral, replication, increased, severity, of, secondary, bacterial, infection, and, reduced, vaccination, efficacy, people, who, have, underlying, health, conditions, are, also, considered, at, risk, including, those, who, have, congenital, or, chronic, heart, problems, or, lung, e, g, asthma, kidney, liver, blood, neurological, or, metabolic, e, g, diabetes, disorders, as, are, people, who, are, immunocompromised, from, chemotherapy, asplenia, prolonged, steroid, treatment, splenic, dysfunction, or, hiv, infection, tobacco, use, including, past, use, places, a, person, at, risk, the, role, of, genetics, in, influenza, is, not, well, researched, but, it, may, be, a, factor, in, influenza, mortality, influenza, is, typically, characterized, by, seasonal, epidemics, and, sporadic, pandemics, most, of, the, burden, of, influenza, is, a, result, of, flu, seasons, caused, by, influenza, a, virus, and, influenza, b, virus, among, influenza, a, virus, subtypes, h1n1, and, h3n2, circulate, in, humans, and, are, responsible, for, seasonal, influenza, cases, disproportionately, occur, in, children, but, most, severe, causes, are, among, the, elderly, the, very, young, and, the, immunocompromised, in, a, typical, year, influenza, viruses, infect, 5, 15, of, the, global, population, causing, 3, 5, million, cases, of, severe, illness, annually, and, accounting, for, 290, 000, 650, 000, deaths, each, year, due, to, respiratory, illness, 5, 10, of, adults, and, 20, 30, of, children, contract, influenza, each, year, the, reported, number, of, influenza, cases, is, usually, much, lower, than, the, actual, number, during, seasonal, epidemics, it, is, estimated, that, about, 80, of, otherwise, healthy, people, who, have, a, cough, or, sore, throat, have, the, flu, approximately, 30, 40, of, people, hospitalized, for, influenza, develop, pneumonia, and, about, 5, of, all, severe, pneumonia, cases, in, hospitals, are, due, to, influenza, which, is, also, the, most, common, cause, of, ards, in, adults, in, children, influenza, and, respiratory, syncytial, virus, are, the, two, most, common, causes, of, ards, about, 3, 5, of, children, each, year, develop, otitis, media, due, to, influenza, adults, who, develop, organ, failure, from, influenza, and, children, who, have, pim, scores, and, acute, renal, failure, have, higher, rates, of, mortality, during, seasonal, influenza, mortality, is, concentrated, in, the, very, young, and, the, elderly, whereas, during, flu, pandemics, young, adults, are, often, affected, at, a, high, rate, in, temperate, regions, the, number, of, influenza, cases, varies, from, season, to, season, lower, vitamin, d, levels, presumably, due, to, less, sunlight, lower, humidity, lower, temperature, and, minor, changes, in, virus, proteins, caused, by, antigenic, drift, contribute, to, annual, epidemics, that, peak, during, the, winter, season, in, the, northern, hemisphere, this, is, from, october, to, may, more, narrowly, december, to, april, and, in, the, southern, hemisphere, this, is, from, may, to, october, more, narrowly, june, to, september, there, are, therefore, two, distinct, influenza, seasons, every, year, in, temperate, regions, one, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, one, in, the, southern, hemisphere, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, seasonality, is, more, complex, and, appears, to, be, affected, by, various, climatic, factors, such, as, minimum, temperature, hours, of, sunshine, maximum, rainfall, and, high, humidity, influenza, may, therefore, occur, year, round, in, these, regions, influenza, epidemics, in, modern, times, have, the, tendency, to, start, in, the, eastern, or, southern, hemisphere, with, asia, being, a, key, reservoir, influenza, a, virus, and, influenza, b, virus, co, circulate, so, have, the, same, patterns, of, transmission, the, seasonality, of, influenza, c, virus, however, is, poorly, understood, influenza, c, virus, infection, is, most, common, in, children, under, the, age, of, two, and, by, adulthood, most, people, have, been, exposed, to, it, influenza, c, virus, associated, hospitalization, most, commonly, occurs, in, children, under, the, age, of, three, and, is, frequently, accompanied, by, co, infection, with, another, virus, or, a, bacterium, which, may, increase, the, severity, of, disease, when, considering, all, hospitalizations, for, respiratory, illness, among, young, children, influenza, c, virus, appears, to, account, for, only, a, small, percentage, of, such, cases, large, outbreaks, of, influenza, c, virus, infection, can, occur, so, incidence, varies, significantly, outbreaks, of, influenza, caused, by, novel, influenza, viruses, are, common, depending, on, the, level, of, pre, existing, immunity, in, the, population, novel, influenza, viruses, can, spread, rapidly, and, cause, pandemics, with, millions, of, deaths, these, pandemics, in, contrast, to, seasonal, influenza, are, caused, by, antigenic, shifts, involving, animal, influenza, viruses, to, date, all, known, flu, pandemics, have, been, caused, by, influenza, a, viruses, and, they, follow, the, same, pattern, of, spreading, from, an, origin, point, to, the, rest, of, the, world, over, the, course, of, multiple, waves, in, a, year, pandemic, strains, tend, to, be, associated, with, higher, rates, of, pneumonia, in, otherwise, healthy, individuals, generally, after, each, influenza, pandemic, the, pandemic, strain, continues, to, circulate, as, the, cause, of, seasonal, influenza, replacing, prior, strains, from, 1700, to, 1889, influenza, pandemics, occurred, about, once, every, 50, 60, years, since, then, pandemics, have, occurred, about, once, every, 10, 50, years, so, they, may, be, getting, more, frequent, over, time, the, first, influenza, epidemic, may, have, occurred, around, 6, 000, bc, in, china, and, possible, descriptions, of, influenza, exist, in, greek, writings, from, the, 5th, century, bc, in, both, 1173, 1174, ad, and, 1387, ad, epidemics, occurred, across, europe, that, were, named, influenza, whether, these, epidemics, or, others, were, caused, by, influenza, is, unclear, since, there, was, then, no, consistent, naming, pattern, for, epidemic, respiratory, diseases, and, influenza, did, not, become, clearly, associated, with, respiratory, disease, until, centuries, later, influenza, may, have, been, brought, to, the, americas, as, early, as, 1493, when, an, epidemic, disease, resembling, influenza, killed, most, of, the, population, of, the, antilles, the, first, convincing, record, of, an, influenza, pandemic, was, in, 1510, it, began, in, east, asia, before, spreading, to, north, africa, and, then, europe, following, the, pandemic, seasonal, influenza, occurred, with, subsequent, pandemics, in, 1557, and, 1580, the, flu, pandemic, in, 1557, was, potentially, the, first, time, influenza, was, connected, to, miscarriage, and, death, of, pregnant, women, the, 1580, influenza, pandemic, originated, in, asia, during, summer, spread, to, africa, then, europe, and, finally, america, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, influenza, was, beginning, to, become, understood, as, a, specific, recognizable, disease, with, epidemic, and, endemic, forms, in, 1648, it, was, discovered, that, horses, also, experience, influenza, influenza, data, after, 1700, is, more, accurate, so, it, is, easier, to, identify, flu, pandemics, after, this, point, the, first, flu, pandemic, of, the, 18th, century, started, in, 1729, in, russia, in, spring, spreading, worldwide, over, the, course, of, three, years, with, distinct, waves, the, later, ones, being, more, lethal, another, flu, pandemic, occurred, in, 1781, 1782, starting, in, china, in, autumn, from, this, pandemic, influenza, became, associated, with, sudden, outbreaks, of, febrile, illness, the, next, flu, pandemic, was, from, 1830, to, 1833, beginning, in, china, in, winter, this, pandemic, had, a, high, attack, rate, but, the, mortality, rate, was, low, a, minor, influenza, pandemic, occurred, from, 1847, to, 1851, at, the, same, time, as, the, third, cholera, pandemic, and, was, the, first, flu, pandemic, to, occur, with, vital, statistics, being, recorded, so, influenza, mortality, was, clearly, recorded, for, the, first, time, fowl, plague, now, recognised, as, highly, pathogenic, avian, influenza, was, recognized, in, 1878, and, was, soon, linked, to, transmission, to, humans, by, the, time, of, the, 1889, pandemic, which, may, have, been, caused, by, an, h2n2, strain, the, flu, had, become, an, easily, recognizable, disease, the, microbial, agent, responsible, for, influenza, was, incorrectly, identified, in, 1892, by, r, f, j, pfeiffer, as, the, bacteria, species, haemophilus, influenzae, which, retains, influenza, in, its, name, from, 1901, to, 1903, italian, and, austrian, researchers, were, able, to, show, that, avian, influenza, then, called, fowl, plague, was, caused, by, a, microscopic, agent, smaller, than, bacteria, by, using, filters, with, pores, too, small, for, bacteria, to, pass, through, the, fundamental, differences, between, viruses, and, bacteria, however, were, not, yet, fully, understood, from, 1918, to, 1920, the, spanish, flu, pandemic, became, the, most, devastating, influenza, pandemic, and, one, of, the, deadliest, pandemics, in, history, the, pandemic, caused, by, an, h1n1, strain, of, influenza, a, likely, began, in, the, united, states, before, spreading, worldwide, via, soldiers, during, and, after, the, first, world, war, the, initial, wave, in, the, first, half, of, 1918, was, relatively, minor, and, resembled, past, flu, pandemics, but, the, second, wave, later, that, year, had, a, much, higher, mortality, rate, a, third, wave, with, lower, mortality, occurred, in, many, places, a, few, months, after, the, second, by, the, end, of, 1920, it, is, estimated, that, about, a, third, to, half, of, all, people, in, the, world, had, been, infected, with, tens, of, millions, of, deaths, disproportionately, young, adults, during, the, 1918, pandemic, the, respiratory, route, of, transmission, was, clearly, identified, and, influenza, was, shown, to, be, caused, by, a, filter, passer, not, a, bacterium, but, there, remained, a, lack, of, agreement, about, influenza, s, cause, for, another, decade, and, research, on, influenza, declined, after, the, pandemic, h1n1, circulated, in, humans, in, seasonal, form, until, the, next, pandemic, in, 1931, richard, shope, published, three, papers, identifying, a, virus, as, the, cause, of, swine, influenza, a, then, newly, recognized, disease, among, pigs, that, was, characterized, during, the, second, wave, of, the, 1918, pandemic, shope, s, research, reinvigorated, research, on, human, influenza, and, many, advances, in, virology, serology, immunology, experimental, animal, models, vaccinology, and, immunotherapy, have, since, arisen, from, influenza, research, just, two, years, after, influenza, viruses, were, discovered, in, 1933, influenza, a, virus, was, identified, as, the, agent, responsible, for, human, influenza, subtypes, of, influenza, a, virus, were, discovered, throughout, the, 1930s, and, influenza, b, virus, was, discovered, in, 1940, during, the, second, world, war, the, us, government, worked, on, developing, inactivated, vaccines, for, influenza, resulting, in, the, first, influenza, vaccine, being, licensed, in, 1945, in, the, united, states, influenza, c, virus, was, discovered, two, years, later, in, 1947, in, 1955, avian, influenza, was, confirmed, to, be, caused, by, influenza, a, virus, four, influenza, pandemics, have, occurred, since, wwii, the, first, of, these, was, the, asian, flu, from, 1957, to, 1958, caused, by, an, h2n2, strain, and, beginning, in, china, s, yunnan, province, the, number, of, deaths, probably, exceeded, one, million, mostly, among, the, very, young, and, very, old, this, was, the, first, flu, pandemic, to, occur, in, the, presence, of, a, global, surveillance, system, and, laboratories, able, to, study, the, novel, influenza, virus, after, the, pandemic, h2n2, was, the, influenza, a, virus, subtype, responsible, for, seasonal, influenza, the, first, antiviral, drug, against, influenza, amantadine, was, approved, in, 1966, with, additional, antiviral, drugs, being, used, since, the, 1990s, in, 1968, h3n2, was, introduced, into, humans, through, a, rearrangement, between, an, avian, h3n2, strain, and, an, h2n2, strain, that, was, circulating, in, humans, the, novel, h3n2, strain, emerged, in, hong, kong, and, spread, worldwide, causing, the, hong, kong, flu, pandemic, which, resulted, in, 500, 000, 2, 000, 000, deaths, this, was, the, first, pandemic, to, spread, significantly, by, air, travel, h2n2, and, h3n2, co, circulated, after, the, pandemic, until, 1971, when, h2n2, waned, in, prevalence, and, was, completely, replaced, by, h3n2, in, 1977, h1n1, reemerged, in, humans, possibly, after, it, was, released, from, a, freezer, in, a, laboratory, accident, and, caused, a, pseudo, pandemic, this, h1n1, strain, was, antigenically, similar, to, the, h1n1, strains, that, circulated, prior, to, 1957, since, 1977, both, h1n1, and, h3n2, have, circulated, in, humans, as, part, of, seasonal, influenza, in, 1980, the, classification, system, used, to, subtype, influenza, viruses, was, introduced, at, some, point, influenza, b, virus, diverged, into, two, strains, named, the, b, victoria, like, and, b, yamagata, like, lineages, both, of, which, have, been, circulating, in, humans, since, 1983, in, 1996, a, highly, pathogenic, h5n1, subtype, of, influenza, a, was, detected, in, geese, in, guangdong, china, and, a, year, later, emerged, in, poultry, in, hong, kong, gradually, spreading, worldwide, from, there, a, small, h5n1, outbreak, in, humans, in, hong, kong, occurred, then, and, sporadic, human, cases, have, occurred, since, 1997, carrying, a, high, case, fatality, rate, the, most, recent, flu, pandemic, was, the, 2009, swine, flu, pandemic, which, originated, in, mexico, and, resulted, in, hundreds, of, thousands, of, deaths, it, was, caused, by, a, novel, h1n1, strain, that, was, a, reassortment, of, human, swine, and, avian, influenza, viruses, the, 2009, pandemic, had, the, effect, of, replacing, prior, h1n1, strains, in, circulation, with, the, novel, strain, but, not, any, other, influenza, viruses, consequently, h1n1, h3n2, and, both, influenza, b, virus, lineages, have, been, in, circulation, in, seasonal, form, since, the, 2009, pandemic, in, 2011, influenza, d, virus, was, discovered, in, pigs, in, oklahoma, usa, and, cattle, were, later, identified, as, the, primary, reservoir, of, influenza, d, virus, in, the, same, year, avian, h7n9, was, detected, in, china, and, began, to, cause, human, infections, in, 2013, starting, in, shanghai, and, anhui, and, remaining, mostly, in, china, highly, pathogenic, h7n9, emerged, sometime, in, 2016, and, has, occasionally, infected, humans, incidentally, other, avian, influenza, viruses, have, less, commonly, infected, humans, since, the, 1990s, including, h5n1, h5n5, h5n6, h5n8, h6n1, h7n2, h7n7, and, h10n7, and, have, begun, to, spread, throughout, much, of, the, world, since, the, 2010s, future, flu, pandemics, which, may, be, caused, by, an, influenza, virus, of, avian, origin, are, viewed, as, almost, inevitable, and, increased, globalization, has, made, it, easier, for, a, pandemic, virus, to, spread, so, there, are, continual, efforts, to, prepare, for, future, pandemics, and, improve, the, prevention, and, treatment, of, influenza, the, word, influenza, comes, from, the, italian, word, influenza, from, medieval, latin, influentia, originally, meaning, visitation, or, influence, terms, such, as, influenza, di, freddo, meaning, influence, of, the, cold, and, influenza, di, stelle, meaning, influence, of, the, stars, are, attested, from, the, 14th, century, the, latter, referred, to, the, disease, s, cause, which, at, the, time, was, ascribed, by, some, to, unfavorable, astrological, conditions, as, early, as, 1504, influenza, began, to, mean, a, visitation, or, outbreak, of, any, disease, affecting, many, people, in, a, single, place, at, once, during, an, outbreak, of, influenza, in, 1743, that, started, in, italy, and, spread, throughout, europe, the, word, reached, the, english, language, and, was, anglicized, in, pronunciation, since, the, mid, 1800s, influenza, has, also, been, used, to, refer, to, severe, colds, the, shortened, form, of, the, word, flu, is, first, attested, in, 1839, as, flue, with, the, spelling, flu, confirmed, in, 1893, other, names, that, have, been, used, for, influenza, include, epidemic, catarrh, la, grippe, from, french, sweating, sickness, and, especially, when, referring, to, the, 1918, pandemic, strain, spanish, fever, aquatic, birds, such, as, ducks, geese, shorebirds, and, gulls, are, the, primary, reservoir, of, influenza, a, viruses, iavs, because, of, the, impact, of, avian, influenza, on, economically, important, chicken, farms, a, classification, system, was, devised, in, 1981, which, divided, avian, virus, strains, as, either, highly, pathogenic, and, therefore, potentially, requiring, vigorous, control, measures, or, low, pathogenic, the, test, for, this, is, based, solely, on, the, effect, on, chickens, a, virus, strain, is, highly, pathogenic, avian, influenza, hpai, if, 75, or, more, of, chickens, die, after, being, deliberately, infected, with, it, the, alternative, classification, is, low, pathogenic, avian, influenza, lpai, which, produces, mild, or, no, symptoms, this, classification, system, has, since, been, modified, to, take, into, account, the, structure, of, the, virus, haemagglutinin, protein, at, the, genetic, level, an, aiv, can, be, identified, as, an, hpai, virus, if, it, has, a, multibasic, cleavage, site, in, the, ha, protein, which, contains, additional, residues, in, the, ha, gene, other, species, of, birds, especially, water, birds, can, become, infected, with, hpai, virus, without, experiencing, severe, symptoms, and, can, spread, the, infection, over, large, distances, the, exact, symptoms, depend, on, the, species, of, bird, and, the, strain, of, virus, classification, of, an, avian, virus, strain, as, hpai, or, lpai, does, not, predict, how, serious, the, disease, might, be, if, it, infects, humans, or, other, mammals, symptoms, of, hpai, infection, in, chickens, include, lack, of, energy, and, appetite, decreased, egg, production, soft, shelled, or, misshapen, eggs, swelling, of, the, head, comb, wattles, and, hocks, purple, discoloration, of, wattles, combs, and, legs, nasal, discharge, coughing, sneezing, incoordination, and, diarrhea, birds, infected, with, an, hpai, virus, may, also, die, suddenly, without, any, signs, of, infection, notable, hpai, viruses, include, influenza, a, h5n1, and, a, h7n9, hpai, viruses, have, been, a, major, disease, burden, in, the, 21st, century, resulting, in, the, death, of, large, numbers, of, birds, in, h7n9, s, case, some, circulating, strains, were, originally, low, pathogenic, but, became, high, pathogenic, by, mutating, to, acquire, the, ha, multibasic, cleavage, site, avian, h9n2, is, also, of, concern, because, although, it, is, low, pathogenic, it, is, a, common, donor, of, genes, to, h5n1, and, h7n9, during, reassortment, migratory, birds, can, spread, influenza, across, long, distances, an, example, of, this, was, when, an, h5n1, strain, in, 2005, infected, birds, at, qinghai, lake, china, which, is, a, stopover, and, breeding, site, for, many, migratory, birds, subsequently, spreading, the, virus, to, more, than, 20, countries, across, asia, europe, and, the, middle, east, aivs, can, be, transmitted, from, wild, birds, to, domestic, free, range, ducks, and, in, turn, to, poultry, through, contaminated, water, aerosols, and, fomites, ducks, therefore, act, as, key, intermediates, between, wild, and, domestic, birds, transmission, to, poultry, typically, occurs, in, backyard, farming, and, live, animal, markets, where, multiple, species, interact, with, each, other, from, there, aivs, can, spread, to, poultry, farms, in, the, absence, of, adequate, biosecurity, among, poultry, hpai, transmission, occurs, through, aerosols, and, contaminated, feces, cages, feed, and, dead, animals, back, transmission, of, hpai, viruses, from, poultry, to, wild, birds, has, occurred, and, is, implicated, in, mass, die, offs, and, intercontinental, spread, aivs, have, occasionally, infected, humans, through, aerosols, fomites, and, contaminated, water, direction, transmission, from, wild, birds, is, rare, instead, most, transmission, involves, domestic, poultry, mainly, chickens, ducks, and, geese, but, also, a, variety, of, other, birds, such, as, guinea, fowl, partridge, pheasants, and, quails, the, primary, risk, factor, for, infection, with, aivs, is, exposure, to, birds, in, farms, and, live, poultry, markets, typically, infection, with, an, aiv, has, an, incubation, period, of, 3, 5, days, but, can, be, up, to, 9, days, h5n1, and, h7n9, cause, severe, lower, respiratory, tract, illness, whereas, other, aivs, such, as, h9n2, cause, a, more, mild, upper, respiratory, tract, illness, commonly, with, conjunctivitis, limited, transmission, of, avian, h2, h5, 7, h9, and, h10, subtypes, from, one, person, to, another, through, respiratory, droplets, aerosols, and, fomites, has, occurred, but, sustained, human, to, human, transmission, of, aivs, has, not, occurred, influenza, in, pigs, is, a, respiratory, disease, similar, to, influenza, in, humans, and, is, found, worldwide, asymptomatic, infections, are, common, symptoms, typically, appear, 1, 3, days, after, infection, and, include, fever, lethargy, anorexia, weight, loss, labored, breathing, coughing, sneezing, and, nasal, discharge, in, sows, pregnancy, may, be, aborted, complications, include, secondary, infections, and, potentially, fatal, bronchopneumonia, pigs, become, contagious, within, a, day, of, infection, and, typically, spread, the, virus, for, 7, 10, days, which, can, spread, rapidly, within, a, herd, pigs, usually, recover, within, 3, 7, days, after, symptoms, appear, prevention, and, control, measures, include, inactivated, vaccines, and, culling, infected, herds, influenza, a, virus, subtypes, h1n1, h1n2, and, h3n2, are, usually, responsible, for, swine, flu, some, influenza, a, viruses, can, be, transmitted, via, aerosols, from, pigs, to, humans, and, vice, versa, pigs, along, with, bats, and, quails, are, recognized, as, a, mixing, vessel, of, influenza, viruses, because, they, have, both, 2, 3, and, 2, 6, sialic, acid, receptors, in, their, respiratory, tract, because, of, that, both, avian, and, mammalian, influenza, viruses, can, infect, pigs, if, co, infection, occurs, reassortment, is, possible, a, notable, example, of, this, was, the, reassortment, of, a, swine, avian, and, human, influenza, virus, that, caused, the, 2009, flu, pandemic, spillover, events, from, humans, to, pigs, appear, to, be, more, common, than, from, pigs, to, humans, influenza, viruses, have, been, found, in, many, other, animals, including, cattle, horses, dogs, cats, and, marine, mammals, nearly, all, influenza, a, viruses, are, apparently, descended, from, ancestral, viruses, in, birds, the, exception, are, bat, influenza, like, viruses, which, have, an, uncertain, origin, these, bat, viruses, have, ha, and, na, subtypes, h17, h18, n10, and, n11, h17n10, and, h18n11, are, unable, to, reassort, with, other, influenza, a, viruses, but, they, are, still, able, to, replicate, in, other, mammals, equine, influenza, a, viruses, include, h7n7, and, two, lineages, of, h3n8, h7n7, however, has, not, been, detected, in, horses, since, the, late, 1970s, so, it, may, have, become, extinct, in, horses, h3n8, in, equines, spreads, via, aerosols, and, causes, respiratory, illness, equine, h3n8, preferentially, binds, to, 2, 3, sialic, acids, so, horses, are, usually, considered, dead, end, hosts, but, transmission, to, dogs, and, camels, has, occurred, raising, concerns, that, horses, may, be, mixing, vessels, for, reassortment, in, canines, the, only, influenza, a, viruses, in, circulation, are, equine, derived, h3n8, and, avian, derived, h3n2, canine, h3n8, has, not, been, observed, to, reassort, with, other, subtypes, h3n2, has, a, much, broader, host, range, and, can, reassort, with, h1n1, and, h5n1, an, isolated, case, of, h6n1, likely, from, a, chicken, was, found, infecting, a, dog, so, other, aivs, may, emerge, in, canines, a, wide, range, of, other, mammals, have, been, affected, by, avian, influenza, a, viruses, generally, due, to, eating, birds, which, had, been, infected, there, have, been, instances, where, transmission, of, the, disease, between, mammals, including, seals, and, cows, may, have, occurred, various, mutations, have, been, identified, that, are, associated, with, aivs, adapting, to, mammals, since, ha, proteins, vary, in, which, sialic, acids, they, bind, to, mutations, in, the, ha, receptor, binding, site, can, allow, aivs, to, infect, mammals, other, mutations, include, mutations, affecting, which, sialic, acids, na, proteins, cleave, and, a, mutation, in, the, pb2, polymerase, subunit, that, improves, tolerance, of, lower, temperatures, in, mammalian, respiratory, tracts, and, enhances, rnp, assembly, by, stabilizing, np, and, pb2, binding, influenza, b, virus, is, mainly, found, in, humans, but, has, also, been, detected, in, pigs, dogs, horses, and, seals, likewise, influenza, c, virus, primarily, infects, humans, but, has, been, observed, in, pigs, dogs, cattle, and, dromedary, camels, influenza, d, virus, causes, an, influenza, like, illness, in, pigs, but, its, impact, in, its, natural, reservoir, cattle, is, relatively, unknown, it, may, cause, respiratory, disease, resembling, human, influenza, on, its, own, or, it, may, be, part, of, a, bovine, respiratory, disease, brd, complex, with, other, pathogens, during, co, infection, brd, is, a, concern, for, the, cattle, industry, so, influenza, d, virus, possible, involvement, in, brd, has, led, to, research, on, vaccines, for, cattle, that, can, provide, protection, against, influenza, d, virus, two, antigenic, lineages, are, in, circulation, d, swine, oklahoma, 1334, 2011, d, ok, and, d, bovine, oklahoma, 660, 2013, d, 660
