scavengers, are, animals, that, consume, dead, organisms, that, have, died, from, causes, other, than, predation, or, have, been, killed, by, other, predators, while, scavenging, generally, refers, to, carnivores, feeding, on, carrion, it, is, also, a, herbivorous, feeding, behavior, scavengers, play, an, important, role, in, the, ecosystem, by, consuming, dead, animal, and, plant, material, decomposers, and, detritivores, complete, this, process, by, consuming, the, remains, left, by, scavengers, scavengers, aid, in, overcoming, fluctuations, of, food, resources, in, the, environment, the, process, and, rate, of, scavenging, is, affected, by, both, biotic, and, abiotic, factors, such, as, carcass, size, habitat, temperature, and, seasons, scavenger, is, an, alteration, of, scavager, from, middle, english, skawager, meaning, customs, collector, from, skawage, meaning, customs, from, old, north, french, escauwage, meaning, inspection, from, schauwer, meaning, to, inspect, of, germanic, origin, akin, to, old, english, sc, awian, and, german, schauen, meaning, to, look, at, and, modern, english, show, with, semantic, drift, obligate, scavenging, subsisting, entirely, or, mainly, on, dead, animals, is, rare, among, vertebrates, due, to, the, difficulty, of, finding, enough, carrion, without, expending, too, much, energy, well, known, invertebrate, scavengers, of, animal, material, include, burying, beetles, and, blowflies, which, are, obligate, scavengers, and, yellowjackets, fly, larvae, are, also, common, scavengers, for, organic, materials, at, the, bottom, of, freshwater, bodies, for, example, tokunagayusurika, akamusi, is, a, species, of, midge, fly, whose, larvae, live, as, obligate, scavengers, at, the, bottom, of, lakes, and, whose, adults, almost, never, feed, and, only, live, up, to, a, few, weeks, most, scavenging, animals, are, facultative, scavengers, that, gain, most, of, their, food, through, other, methods, especially, predation, many, large, carnivores, that, hunt, regularly, such, as, hyenas, and, jackals, but, also, animals, rarely, thought, of, as, scavengers, such, as, african, lions, leopards, and, wolves, will, scavenge, if, given, the, chance, they, may, also, use, their, size, and, ferocity, to, intimidate, the, original, hunters, the, cheetah, is, a, notable, victim, rather, than, a, perpetrator, almost, all, scavengers, above, insect, size, are, predators, and, will, hunt, if, not, enough, carrion, is, available, as, few, ecosystems, provide, enough, dead, animals, year, round, to, keep, its, scavengers, fed, on, that, alone, scavenging, wild, dogs, and, crows, frequently, exploit, roadkill, scavengers, of, dead, plant, material, include, termites, that, build, nests, in, grasslands, and, then, collect, dead, plant, material, for, consumption, within, the, nest, the, interaction, between, scavenging, animals, and, humans, is, seen, today, most, commonly, in, suburban, settings, with, animals, such, as, opossums, polecats, and, raccoons, in, some, african, towns, and, villages, scavenging, from, hyenas, is, also, common, in, the, prehistoric, eras, the, species, tyrannosaurus, rex, may, have, been, an, apex, predator, preying, upon, hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, and, possibly, juvenile, sauropods, although, some, experts, have, suggested, the, dinosaur, was, primarily, a, scavenger, the, debate, about, whether, tyrannosaurus, was, an, apex, predator, or, scavenger, was, among, the, longest, ongoing, feuds, in, paleontology, however, most, scientists, now, agree, that, tyrannosaurus, was, an, opportunistic, carnivore, acting, mostly, as, a, predator, but, also, scavenging, when, it, could, sense, it, recent, research, also, shows, that, while, an, adult, t, rex, would, energetically, gain, little, through, scavenging, smaller, theropods, of, approximately, 500, kg, 1, 100, lb, might, have, gained, levels, similar, to, those, of, hyenas, though, not, enough, for, them, to, rely, on, scavenging, other, research, suggests, that, carcasses, of, giant, sauropods, may, have, made, scavenging, much, more, profitable, to, carnivores, than, it, is, now, for, example, a, single, 40, tonne, apatosaurus, carcass, would, have, been, worth, roughly, 6, years, of, calories, for, an, average, allosaur, as, a, result, of, this, resource, oversupply, it, is, possible, that, some, theropods, evolved, to, get, most, of, their, calories, by, scavenging, giant, sauropod, carcasses, and, may, not, have, needed, to, consistently, hunt, in, order, to, survive, the, same, study, suggested, that, theropods, in, relatively, sauropod, free, environments, such, as, tyrannosaurs, were, not, exposed, to, the, same, type, of, carrion, oversupply, and, were, therefore, forced, to, hunt, in, order, to, survive, animals, which, consume, feces, such, as, dung, beetles, are, referred, to, as, coprovores, animals, that, collect, small, particles, of, dead, organic, material, of, both, animal, and, plant, origin, are, referred, to, as, detritivores, scavengers, play, a, fundamental, role, in, the, environment, through, the, removal, of, decaying, organisms, serving, as, a, natural, sanitation, service, while, microscopic, and, invertebrate, decomposers, break, down, dead, organisms, into, simple, organic, matter, which, are, used, by, nearby, autotrophs, scavengers, help, conserve, energy, and, nutrients, obtained, from, carrion, within, the, upper, trophic, levels, and, are, able, to, disperse, the, energy, and, nutrients, farther, away, from, the, site, of, the, carrion, than, decomposers, scavenging, unites, animals, which, normally, would, not, come, into, contact, and, results, in, the, formation, of, highly, structured, and, complex, communities, which, engage, in, nonrandom, interactions, scavenging, communities, function, in, the, redistribution, of, energy, obtained, from, carcasses, and, reducing, diseases, associated, with, decomposition, oftentimes, scavenger, communities, differ, in, consistency, due, to, carcass, size, and, carcass, types, as, well, as, by, seasonal, effects, as, consequence, of, differing, invertebrate, and, microbial, activity, competition, for, carrion, results, in, the, inclusion, or, exclusion, of, certain, scavengers, from, access, to, carrion, shaping, the, scavenger, community, when, carrion, decomposes, at, a, slower, rate, during, cooler, seasons, competitions, between, scavengers, decrease, while, the, number, of, scavenger, species, present, increases, alterations, in, scavenging, communities, may, result, in, drastic, changes, to, the, scavenging, community, in, general, reduce, ecosystem, services, and, have, detrimental, effects, on, animal, and, humans, the, reintroduction, of, gray, wolves, canis, lupus, into, yellowstone, national, park, in, the, united, states, caused, drastic, changes, to, the, prevalent, scavenging, community, resulting, in, the, provision, of, carrion, to, many, mammalian, and, avian, species, likewise, the, reduction, of, vulture, species, in, india, lead, to, the, increase, of, opportunistic, species, such, as, feral, dogs, and, rats, the, presence, of, both, species, at, carcasses, resulted, in, the, increase, of, diseases, such, as, rabies, and, bubonic, plague, in, wildlife, and, livestock, as, feral, dogs, and, rats, are, transmitters, of, such, diseases, furthermore, the, decline, of, vulture, populations, in, india, has, been, linked, to, the, increased, rates, of, anthrax, in, humans, due, to, the, handling, and, ingestion, of, infected, livestock, carcasses, an, increase, of, disease, transmission, has, been, observed, in, mammalian, scavengers, in, kenya, due, to, the, decrease, in, vulture, populations, in, the, area, as, the, decrease, in, vulture, populations, resulted, in, an, increase, of, the, number, of, mammalian, scavengers, at, a, given, carcass, along, with, the, time, spent, at, a, carcass, scavenging, may, provide, a, direct, and, indirect, method, for, transmitting, disease, between, animals, scavengers, of, infected, carcasses, may, become, hosts, for, certain, pathogens, and, consequently, vectors, of, disease, themselves, an, example, of, this, phenomenon, is, the, increased, transmission, of, tuberculosis, observed, when, scavengers, engage, in, eating, infected, carcasses, likewise, the, ingestion, of, bat, carcasses, infected, with, rabies, by, striped, skunks, mephitis, mephitis, resulted, in, increased, infection, of, these, organisms, with, the, virus, a, major, vector, of, transmission, of, diseases, are, various, bird, species, with, outbreak, being, influenced, by, such, carrier, birds, and, their, environment, an, avian, cholera, outbreak, from, 2006, to, 2007, off, the, coast, newfoundland, canada, resulted, in, the, mortality, of, many, marine, bird, species, the, transmission, perpetuation, and, spread, of, the, outbreak, was, mainly, restricted, to, gull, species, who, scavenge, for, food, in, the, area, similarly, an, increase, of, transmission, of, avian, influenza, virus, to, chickens, by, domestic, ducks, from, indonesian, farms, permitted, to, scavenge, surrounding, areas, was, observed, in, 2007, the, scavenging, of, ducks, in, rice, paddy, fields, in, particular, resulted, in, increased, contact, with, other, bird, species, feeding, on, leftover, rice, which, may, have, contributed, to, increased, infection, and, transmission, of, the, avian, influenza, virus, the, domestic, ducks, may, not, have, demonstrated, symptoms, of, infection, themselves, though, were, observed, to, excrete, high, concentrations, of, the, avian, influenza, virus, many, species, that, scavenge, face, persecution, globally, vultures, in, particular, have, faced, incredible, persecution, and, threats, by, humans, before, its, ban, by, regional, governments, in, 2006, the, veterinary, drug, diclofenac, has, resulted, in, at, least, a, 95, decline, of, gyps, vultures, in, asia, habitat, loss, and, food, shortage, have, contributed, to, the, decline, of, vulture, species, in, west, africa, due, to, the, growing, human, population, and, over, hunting, of, vulture, food, sources, as, well, as, changes, in, livestock, husbandry, poisoning, certain, predators, to, increase, the, number, of, game, animals, is, still, a, common, hunting, practice, in, europe, and, contributes, to, the, poisoning, of, vultures, when, they, consume, the, carcasses, of, poisoned, predators, highly, efficient, scavengers, also, known, as, dominant, or, apex, scavengers, can, have, benefits, to, humans, increases, in, dominant, scavenger, populations, such, as, vultures, can, reduce, populations, of, smaller, opportunistic, scavengers, such, as, rats, these, smaller, scavengers, are, often, pests, and, disease, vectors, in, the, 1980s, lewis, binford, suggested, that, early, humans, primarily, obtained, meat, via, scavenging, not, through, hunting, in, 2010, dennis, bramble, and, daniel, lieberman, proposed, that, early, carnivorous, human, ancestors, subsequently, developed, long, distance, running, behaviors, which, improved, the, ability, to, scavenge, and, hunt, they, could, reach, scavenging, sites, more, quickly, and, also, pursue, a, single, animal, until, it, could, be, safely, killed, at, close, range, due, to, exhaustion, and, hyperthermia, in, tibetan, buddhism, the, practice, of, excarnation, that, is, the, exposure, of, dead, human, bodies, to, carrion, birds, and, or, other, scavenging, animals, is, the, distinctive, characteristic, of, sky, burial, which, involves, the, dismemberment, of, human, cadavers, of, whom, the, remains, are, fed, to, vultures, and, traditionally, the, main, funeral, rite, alongside, cremation, used, to, dispose, of, the, human, body, a, similar, funerary, practice, that, features, excarnation, can, be, found, in, zoroastrianism, in, order, to, prevent, the, pollution, of, the, sacred, elements, fire, earth, and, water, from, contact, with, decomposing, bodies, human, cadavers, are, exposed, on, the, towers, of, silence, to, be, eaten, by, vultures, and, wild, dogs, studies, in, behavioral, ecology, and, ecological, epidemiology, have, shown, that, cannibalistic, necrophagy, although, rare, has, been, observed, as, a, survival, behavior, in, several, social, species, including, anatomically, modern, humans, however, episodes, of, human, cannibalism, occur, rarely, in, most, human, societies, many, instances, have, occurred, in, human, history, especially, in, times, of, war, and, famine, where, necrophagy, and, human, cannibalism, emerged, as, a, survival, behavior, although, anthropologists, report, the, usage, of, ritual, cannibalism, among, funerary, practices, and, as, the, preferred, means, of, disposal, of, the, dead, in, some, tribal, societies
