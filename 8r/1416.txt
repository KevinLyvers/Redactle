malaria, is, a, mosquito, borne, infectious, disease, that, affects, vertebrates, human, malaria, causes, symptoms, that, typically, include, fever, fatigue, vomiting, and, headaches, in, severe, cases, it, can, cause, jaundice, seizures, coma, or, death, symptoms, usually, begin, 10, to, 15, days, after, being, bitten, by, an, infected, anopheles, mosquito, if, not, properly, treated, people, may, have, recurrences, of, the, disease, months, later, in, those, who, have, recently, survived, an, infection, reinfection, usually, causes, milder, symptoms, this, partial, resistance, disappears, over, months, to, years, if, the, person, has, no, continuing, exposure, to, malaria, human, malaria, is, caused, by, single, celled, microorganisms, of, the, plasmodium, group, it, is, spread, exclusively, through, bites, of, infected, female, anopheles, mosquitoes, the, mosquito, bite, introduces, the, parasites, from, the, mosquito, s, saliva, into, a, person, s, blood, the, parasites, travel, to, the, liver, where, they, mature, and, reproduce, five, species, of, plasmodium, commonly, infect, humans, the, three, species, associated, with, more, severe, cases, are, p, falciparum, which, is, responsible, for, the, vast, majority, of, malaria, deaths, p, vivax, and, p, knowlesi, a, simian, malaria, that, spills, over, into, thousands, of, people, a, year, p, ovale, and, p, malariae, generally, cause, a, milder, form, of, malaria, malaria, is, typically, diagnosed, by, the, microscopic, examination, of, blood, using, blood, films, or, with, antigen, based, rapid, diagnostic, tests, methods, that, use, the, polymerase, chain, reaction, to, detect, the, parasite, s, dna, have, been, developed, but, they, are, not, widely, used, in, areas, where, malaria, is, common, due, to, their, cost, and, complexity, the, risk, of, disease, can, be, reduced, by, preventing, mosquito, bites, through, the, use, of, mosquito, nets, and, insect, repellents, or, with, mosquito, control, measures, such, as, spraying, insecticides, and, draining, standing, water, several, medications, are, available, to, prevent, malaria, for, travellers, in, areas, where, the, disease, is, common, occasional, doses, of, the, combination, medication, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, are, recommended, in, infants, and, after, the, first, trimester, of, pregnancy, in, areas, with, high, rates, of, malaria, as, of, 2023, two, malaria, vaccines, have, been, endorsed, by, the, world, health, organization, the, recommended, treatment, for, malaria, is, a, combination, of, antimalarial, medications, that, includes, artemisinin, the, second, medication, may, be, either, mefloquine, lumefantrine, or, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, quinine, along, with, doxycycline, may, be, used, if, artemisinin, is, not, available, in, areas, where, the, disease, is, common, malaria, should, be, confirmed, if, possible, before, treatment, is, started, due, to, concerns, of, increasing, drug, resistance, resistance, among, the, parasites, has, developed, to, several, antimalarial, medications, for, example, chloroquine, resistant, p, falciparum, has, spread, to, most, malarial, areas, and, resistance, to, artemisinin, has, become, a, problem, in, some, parts, of, southeast, asia, the, disease, is, widespread, in, the, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, that, exist, in, a, broad, band, around, the, equator, this, includes, much, of, sub, saharan, africa, asia, and, latin, america, in, 2022, some, 249, million, cases, of, malaria, worldwide, resulted, in, an, estimated, 608, 000, deaths, with, 80, percent, being, five, years, old, or, less, around, 95, of, the, cases, and, deaths, occurred, in, sub, saharan, africa, rates, of, disease, decreased, from, 2010, to, 2014, but, increased, from, 2015, to, 2021, according, to, unicef, nearly, every, minute, a, child, under, five, died, of, malaria, in, 2021, and, many, of, these, deaths, are, preventable, and, treatable, malaria, is, commonly, associated, with, poverty, and, has, a, significant, negative, effect, on, economic, development, in, africa, it, is, estimated, to, result, in, losses, of, us, 12, billion, a, year, due, to, increased, healthcare, costs, lost, ability, to, work, and, adverse, effects, on, tourism, the, term, malaria, originates, from, medieval, italian, mala, aria, bad, air, a, part, of, miasma, theory, the, disease, was, formerly, called, ague, or, marsh, fever, due, to, its, association, with, swamps, and, marshland, the, term, appeared, in, english, at, least, as, early, as, 1768, malaria, was, once, common, in, most, of, europe, and, north, america, where, it, is, no, longer, endemic, though, imported, cases, do, occur, adults, with, malaria, tend, to, experience, chills, and, fever, classically, in, periodic, intense, bouts, lasting, around, six, hours, followed, by, a, period, of, sweating, and, fever, relief, as, well, as, headache, fatigue, abdominal, discomfort, and, muscle, pain, children, tend, to, have, more, general, symptoms, fever, cough, vomiting, and, diarrhea, initial, manifestations, of, the, disease, common, to, all, malaria, species, are, similar, to, flu, like, symptoms, and, can, resemble, other, conditions, such, as, sepsis, gastroenteritis, and, viral, diseases, the, presentation, may, include, headache, fever, shivering, joint, pain, vomiting, hemolytic, anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin, in, the, urine, retinal, damage, and, convulsions, the, classic, symptom, of, malaria, is, paroxysm, a, cyclical, occurrence, of, sudden, coldness, followed, by, shivering, and, then, fever, and, sweating, occurring, every, two, days, tertian, fever, in, p, vivax, and, p, ovale, infections, and, every, three, days, quartan, fever, for, p, malariae, p, falciparum, infection, can, cause, recurrent, fever, every, 36, 48, hours, or, a, less, pronounced, and, almost, continuous, fever, symptoms, typically, begin, 10, 15, days, after, the, initial, mosquito, bite, but, can, occur, as, late, as, several, months, after, infection, with, some, p, vivax, strains, travellers, taking, preventative, malaria, medications, may, develop, symptoms, once, they, stop, taking, the, drugs, severe, malaria, is, usually, caused, by, p, falciparum, often, referred, to, as, falciparum, malaria, symptoms, of, falciparum, malaria, arise, 9, 30, days, after, infection, individuals, with, cerebral, malaria, frequently, exhibit, neurological, symptoms, including, abnormal, posturing, nystagmus, conjugate, gaze, palsy, failure, of, the, eyes, to, turn, together, in, the, same, direction, opisthotonus, seizures, or, coma, diagnosis, based, on, skin, odor, profiles, humans, emanate, a, large, range, of, smells, studies, have, been, conducted, on, how, to, detect, human, malaria, infections, through, volatile, compounds, from, the, skin, suggesting, that, volatile, biomarkers, may, be, a, reliable, source, for, the, detection, of, infection, including, those, asymptomatic, using, skin, body, odor, profiles, can, be, efficient, in, diagnosing, global, populations, and, the, screening, and, monitoring, of, infection, to, officially, eradicate, malaria, research, findings, have, predominantly, relied, on, chemical, explanations, to, explain, the, differences, in, attractiveness, among, humans, based, on, distinct, odor, profiles, the, existence, of, volatile, compounds, like, fatty, acids, and, lactic, acid, is, an, essential, reason, on, why, some, individuals, are, more, appealing, to, mosquitos, than, others, volatile, compounds, kanika, khanna, a, postdoctoral, scholar, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, studying, the, structural, basis, of, membrane, manipulation, and, cell, cell, fusion, by, bacterial, pathogens, discusses, studies, that, determine, how, odor, profiles, can, be, used, to, diagnose, the, disease, within, the, study, samples, of, volatile, compounds, from, around, 400, children, within, schools, in, western, kenya, were, collected, to, identify, asymptomatic, infections, these, biomarkers, have, been, established, as, a, non, invasive, way, to, detect, malarial, infections, in, addition, these, volatile, compounds, were, heavily, detected, by, mosquito, antennae, as, an, attractant, making, the, children, more, vulnerable, to, the, bite, of, the, mosquitos, fatty, acids, fatty, acids, have, been, identified, as, an, attractive, compound, for, mosquitoes, they, are, typically, found, in, volatile, emissions, from, the, skin, these, fatty, acids, that, produce, body, odor, profiles, originate, from, the, metabolism, of, glycerol, lactic, acid, amino, acids, and, lipids, through, the, action, of, bacteria, found, within, the, skin, they, create, a, chemical, signature, for, the, mosquitoes, to, locate, a, potential, host, humans, in, particular, lactic, acid, lactic, acid, a, naturally, produced, levorotatory, isomer, has, been, titled, an, attractant, of, mosquitoes, for, a, long, time, lactic, acid, is, predominantly, produced, by, eccrine, sweat, glands, creating, a, large, amount, of, sweat, on, the, surface, of, the, skin, due, to, the, high, levels, of, lactic, acid, released, from, the, human, body, it, has, been, hypothesized, to, represent, a, specific, human, host, recognition, cue, for, anthropophilic, attracted, to, humans, mosquitoes, pungent, foot, odor, most, studies, use, human, odors, as, stimuli, to, attract, host, seeking, mosquitoes, and, have, reported, a, strong, and, significant, attractive, effect, the, studies, have, found, human, odor, samples, very, effective, in, attracting, mosquitoes, foot, odors, have, been, demonstrated, to, have, the, highest, attractiveness, to, anthropophilic, mosquitoes, some, of, these, studies, have, included, traps, that, had, been, baited, with, nylon, socks, previously, worn, by, human, participants, and, were, deemed, efficient, in, catching, adult, mosquitos, foot, odors, have, high, numbers, of, volatile, compounds, which, in, turn, elicit, an, olfactory, response, from, mosquitoes, malaria, has, several, serious, complications, including, the, development, of, respiratory, distress, which, occurs, in, up, to, 25, of, adults, and, 40, of, children, with, severe, p, falciparum, malaria, possible, causes, include, respiratory, compensation, of, metabolic, acidosis, noncardiogenic, pulmonary, oedema, concomitant, pneumonia, and, severe, anaemia, although, rare, in, young, children, with, severe, malaria, acute, respiratory, distress, syndrome, occurs, in, 5, 25, of, adults, and, up, to, 29, of, pregnant, women, coinfection, of, hiv, with, malaria, increases, mortality, kidney, failure, is, a, feature, of, blackwater, fever, where, haemoglobin, from, lysed, red, blood, cells, leaks, into, the, urine, infection, with, p, falciparum, may, result, in, cerebral, malaria, a, form, of, severe, malaria, that, involves, encephalopathy, it, is, associated, with, retinal, whitening, which, may, be, a, useful, clinical, sign, in, distinguishing, malaria, from, other, causes, of, fever, an, enlarged, spleen, enlarged, liver, or, both, of, these, severe, headache, low, blood, sugar, and, haemoglobin, in, the, urine, with, kidney, failure, may, occur, complications, may, include, spontaneous, bleeding, coagulopathy, and, shock, malaria, in, pregnant, women, is, an, important, cause, of, stillbirths, infant, mortality, miscarriage, and, low, birth, weight, particularly, in, p, falciparum, infection, but, also, with, p, vivax, malaria, is, caused, by, infection, with, parasites, in, the, genus, plasmodium, in, humans, malaria, is, caused, by, six, plasmodium, species, p, falciparum, p, malariae, p, ovale, curtisi, p, ovale, wallikeri, p, vivax, and, p, knowlesi, among, those, infected, p, falciparum, is, the, most, common, species, identified, 75, followed, by, p, vivax, 20, although, p, falciparum, traditionally, accounts, for, the, majority, of, deaths, recent, evidence, suggests, that, p, vivax, malaria, is, associated, with, potentially, life, threatening, conditions, about, as, often, as, with, a, diagnosis, of, p, falciparum, infection, p, vivax, proportionally, is, more, common, outside, africa, some, cases, have, been, documented, of, human, infections, with, several, species, of, plasmodium, from, higher, apes, but, except, for, p, knowlesi, a, zoonotic, species, that, causes, malaria, in, macaques, these, are, mostly, of, limited, public, health, importance, the, anopheles, mosquitos, initially, get, infected, by, plasmodium, by, taking, a, blood, meal, from, a, previously, plasmodium, infected, person, parasites, are, then, typically, introduced, by, the, bite, of, an, infected, anopheles, mosquito, some, of, these, inoculated, parasites, called, sporozoites, probably, remain, in, the, skin, but, others, travel, in, the, bloodstream, to, the, liver, where, they, invade, hepatocytes, they, grow, and, divide, in, the, liver, for, 2, 10, days, with, each, infected, hepatocyte, eventually, harboring, up, to, 40, 000, parasites, the, infected, hepatocytes, break, down, releasing, these, invasive, plasmodium, cells, called, merozoites, into, the, bloodstream, in, the, blood, the, merozoites, rapidly, invade, individual, red, blood, cells, replicating, over, 24, 72, hours, to, form, 16, 32, new, merozoites, the, infected, red, blood, cell, lyses, and, the, new, merozoites, infect, new, red, blood, cells, resulting, in, a, cycle, that, continuously, amplifies, the, number, of, parasites, in, an, infected, person, over, rounds, of, this, infection, cycle, a, small, portion, of, parasites, do, not, replicate, but, instead, develop, into, early, sexual, stage, parasites, called, male, and, female, gametocytes, these, gametocytes, develop, in, the, bone, marrow, for, 11, days, then, return, to, the, blood, circulation, to, await, uptake, by, the, bite, of, another, mosquito, once, inside, a, mosquito, the, gametocytes, undergo, sexual, reproduction, and, eventually, form, daughter, sporozoites, that, migrate, to, the, mosquito, s, salivary, glands, to, be, injected, into, a, new, host, when, the, mosquito, bites, the, liver, infection, causes, no, symptoms, all, symptoms, of, malaria, result, from, the, infection, of, red, blood, cells, symptoms, develop, once, there, are, more, than, around, 100, 000, parasites, per, milliliter, of, blood, many, of, the, symptoms, associated, with, severe, malaria, are, caused, by, the, tendency, of, p, falciparum, to, bind, to, blood, vessel, walls, resulting, in, damage, to, the, affected, vessels, and, surrounding, tissue, parasites, sequestered, in, the, blood, vessels, of, the, lung, contribute, to, respiratory, failure, in, the, brain, they, contribute, to, coma, in, the, placenta, they, contribute, to, low, birthweight, and, preterm, labor, and, increase, the, risk, of, abortion, and, stillbirth, the, destruction, of, red, blood, cells, during, infection, often, results, in, anemia, exacerbated, by, reduced, production, of, new, red, blood, cells, during, infection, only, female, mosquitoes, feed, on, blood, male, mosquitoes, feed, on, plant, nectar, and, do, not, transmit, the, disease, females, of, the, mosquito, genus, anopheles, prefer, to, feed, at, night, they, usually, start, searching, for, a, meal, at, dusk, and, continue, through, the, night, until, they, succeed, however, in, africa, due, to, the, extensive, use, of, bed, nets, they, began, to, bite, earlier, before, bed, net, time, malaria, parasites, can, also, be, transmitted, by, blood, transfusions, although, this, is, rare, symptoms, of, malaria, can, recur, after, varying, symptom, free, periods, depending, upon, the, cause, recurrence, can, be, classified, as, either, recrudescence, relapse, or, reinfection, recrudescence, is, when, symptoms, return, after, a, symptom, free, period, due, to, failure, to, remove, blood, stage, parasites, by, adequate, treatment, relapse, is, when, symptoms, reappear, after, the, parasites, have, been, eliminated, from, the, blood, but, have, persisted, as, dormant, hypnozoites, in, liver, cells, relapse, commonly, occurs, between, 8, and, 24, weeks, after, the, initial, symptoms, and, is, often, seen, in, p, vivax, and, p, ovale, infections, p, vivax, malaria, cases, in, temperate, areas, often, involve, overwintering, by, hypnozoites, with, relapses, beginning, the, year, after, the, mosquito, bite, reinfection, means, that, parasites, were, eliminated, from, the, entire, body, but, new, parasites, were, then, introduced, reinfection, cannot, readily, be, distinguished, from, relapse, and, recrudescence, although, recurrence, of, infection, within, two, weeks, of, treatment, ending, is, typically, attributed, to, treatment, failure, people, may, develop, some, immunity, when, exposed, to, frequent, infections, malaria, infection, develops, via, two, phases, one, that, involves, the, liver, exoerythrocytic, phase, and, one, that, involves, red, blood, cells, or, erythrocytes, erythrocytic, phase, when, an, infected, mosquito, pierces, a, person, s, skin, to, take, a, blood, meal, sporozoites, in, the, mosquito, s, saliva, enter, the, bloodstream, and, migrate, to, the, liver, where, they, infect, hepatocytes, multiplying, asexually, and, asymptomatically, for, a, period, of, 8, 30, days, after, a, potential, dormant, period, in, the, liver, these, organisms, differentiate, to, yield, thousands, of, merozoites, which, following, rupture, of, their, host, cells, escape, into, the, blood, and, infect, red, blood, cells, to, begin, the, erythrocytic, stage, of, the, life, cycle, the, parasite, escapes, from, the, liver, undetected, by, wrapping, itself, in, the, cell, membrane, of, the, infected, host, liver, cell, within, the, red, blood, cells, the, parasites, multiply, further, again, asexually, periodically, breaking, out, of, their, host, cells, to, invade, fresh, red, blood, cells, several, such, amplification, cycles, occur, thus, classical, descriptions, of, waves, of, fever, arise, from, simultaneous, waves, of, merozoites, escaping, and, infecting, red, blood, cells, some, p, vivax, sporozoites, do, not, immediately, develop, into, exoerythrocytic, phase, merozoites, but, instead, produce, hypnozoites, that, remain, dormant, for, periods, ranging, from, several, months, 7, 10, months, is, typical, to, several, years, after, a, period, of, dormancy, they, reactivate, and, produce, merozoites, hypnozoites, are, responsible, for, long, incubation, and, late, relapses, in, p, vivax, infections, although, their, existence, in, p, ovale, is, uncertain, the, parasite, is, relatively, protected, from, attack, by, the, body, s, immune, system, because, for, most, of, its, human, life, cycle, it, resides, within, the, liver, and, blood, cells, and, is, relatively, invisible, to, immune, surveillance, however, circulating, infected, blood, cells, are, destroyed, in, the, spleen, to, avoid, this, fate, the, p, falciparum, parasite, displays, adhesive, proteins, on, the, surface, of, the, infected, blood, cells, causing, the, blood, cells, to, stick, to, the, walls, of, small, blood, vessels, thereby, sequestering, the, parasite, from, passage, through, the, general, circulation, and, the, spleen, the, blockage, of, the, microvasculature, causes, symptoms, such, as, those, in, placental, malaria, sequestered, red, blood, cells, can, breach, the, blood, brain, barrier, and, cause, cerebral, malaria, due, to, the, high, levels, of, mortality, and, morbidity, caused, by, malaria, especially, the, p, falciparum, species, it, has, placed, the, greatest, selective, pressure, on, the, human, genome, in, recent, history, several, genetic, factors, provide, some, resistance, to, it, including, sickle, cell, trait, thalassaemia, traits, glucose, 6, phosphate, dehydrogenase, deficiency, and, the, absence, of, duffy, antigens, on, red, blood, cells, the, impact, of, sickle, cell, trait, on, malaria, immunity, illustrates, some, evolutionary, trade, offs, that, have, occurred, because, of, endemic, malaria, sickle, cell, trait, causes, a, change, in, the, haemoglobin, molecule, in, the, blood, normally, red, blood, cells, have, a, very, flexible, biconcave, shape, that, allows, them, to, move, through, narrow, capillaries, however, when, the, modified, haemoglobin, s, molecules, are, exposed, to, low, amounts, of, oxygen, or, crowd, together, due, to, dehydration, they, can, stick, together, forming, strands, that, cause, the, cell, to, distort, into, a, curved, sickle, shape, in, these, strands, the, molecule, is, not, as, effective, in, taking, or, releasing, oxygen, and, the, cell, is, not, flexible, enough, to, circulate, freely, in, the, early, stages, of, malaria, the, parasite, can, cause, infected, red, cells, to, sickle, and, so, they, are, removed, from, circulation, sooner, this, reduces, the, frequency, with, which, malaria, parasites, complete, their, life, cycle, in, the, cell, individuals, who, are, homozygous, with, two, copies, of, the, abnormal, haemoglobin, beta, allele, have, sickle, cell, anaemia, while, those, who, are, heterozygous, with, one, abnormal, allele, and, one, normal, allele, experience, resistance, to, malaria, without, severe, anaemia, although, the, shorter, life, expectancy, for, those, with, the, homozygous, condition, would, tend, to, disfavour, the, trait, s, survival, the, trait, is, preserved, in, malaria, prone, regions, because, of, the, benefits, provided, by, the, heterozygous, form, liver, dysfunction, as, a, result, of, malaria, is, uncommon, and, usually, only, occurs, in, those, with, another, liver, condition, such, as, viral, hepatitis, or, chronic, liver, disease, the, syndrome, is, sometimes, called, malarial, hepatitis, while, it, has, been, considered, a, rare, occurrence, malarial, hepatopathy, has, seen, an, increase, particularly, in, southeast, asia, and, india, liver, compromise, in, people, with, malaria, correlates, with, a, greater, likelihood, of, complications, and, death, malaria, infection, affects, the, immune, responses, following, vaccination, for, various, diseases, for, example, malaria, suppresses, immune, responses, to, polysaccharide, vaccines, a, potential, solution, is, to, give, curative, treatment, before, vaccination, in, areas, where, malaria, is, present, due, to, the, non, specific, nature, of, malaria, symptoms, diagnosis, is, typically, suspected, based, on, symptoms, and, travel, history, then, confirmed, with, a, laboratory, test, to, detect, the, presence, of, the, parasite, in, the, blood, parasitological, test, in, areas, where, malaria, is, common, the, world, health, organization, who, recommends, clinicians, suspect, malaria, in, any, person, who, reports, having, fevers, or, who, has, a, current, temperature, above, 37, 5, c, without, any, other, obvious, cause, malaria, should, be, suspected, in, children, with, signs, of, anemia, pale, palms, or, a, laboratory, test, showing, hemoglobin, levels, below, 8, grams, per, deciliter, of, blood, in, areas, of, the, world, with, little, to, no, malaria, the, who, recommends, only, testing, people, with, possible, exposure, to, malaria, typically, travel, to, a, malaria, endemic, area, and, unexplained, fever, in, sub, saharan, africa, testing, is, low, with, only, about, one, in, four, 28, of, children, with, a, fever, receiving, medical, advice, or, a, rapid, diagnostic, test, in, 2021, there, was, a, 10, percentage, point, gap, in, testing, between, the, richest, and, the, poorest, children, 33, vs, 23, additionally, a, greater, proportion, of, children, in, eastern, and, southern, africa, 36, were, tested, than, in, west, and, central, africa, 21, according, to, unicef, 61, of, children, with, a, fever, were, taken, for, advice, or, treatment, from, a, health, facility, or, provider, in, 2021, disparities, are, also, observed, by, wealth, with, an, 18, percentage, point, difference, in, care, seeking, behaviour, between, children, in, the, richest, 71, and, the, poorest, 53, households, malaria, is, usually, confirmed, by, the, microscopic, examination, of, blood, films, or, by, antigen, based, rapid, diagnostic, tests, rdt, microscopy, i, e, examining, giemsa, stained, blood, with, a, light, microscope, is, the, gold, standard, for, malaria, diagnosis, microscopists, typically, examine, both, a, thick, film, of, blood, allowing, them, to, scan, many, blood, cells, in, a, short, time, and, a, thin, film, of, blood, allowing, them, to, clearly, see, individual, parasites, and, identify, the, infecting, plasmodium, species, under, typical, field, laboratory, conditions, a, microscopist, can, detect, parasites, when, there, are, at, least, 100, parasites, per, microliter, of, blood, which, is, around, the, lower, range, of, symptomatic, infection, microscopic, diagnosis, is, relatively, resource, intensive, requiring, trained, personnel, specific, equipment, electricity, and, a, consistent, supply, of, microscopy, slides, and, stains, in, places, where, microscopy, is, unavailable, malaria, is, diagnosed, with, rdts, rapid, antigen, tests, that, detect, parasite, proteins, in, a, fingerstick, blood, sample, a, variety, of, rdts, are, commercially, available, targeting, the, parasite, proteins, histidine, rich, protein, 2, hrp2, detects, p, falciparum, only, lactate, dehydrogenase, or, aldolase, the, hrp2, test, is, widely, used, in, africa, where, p, falciparum, predominates, however, since, hrp2, persists, in, the, blood, for, up, to, five, weeks, after, an, infection, is, treated, an, hrp2, test, sometimes, cannot, distinguish, whether, someone, currently, has, malaria, or, previously, had, it, additionally, some, p, falciparum, parasites, in, the, amazon, region, lack, the, hrp2, gene, complicating, detection, rdts, are, fast, and, easily, deployed, to, places, without, full, diagnostic, laboratories, however, they, give, considerably, less, information, than, microscopy, and, sometimes, vary, in, quality, from, producer, to, producer, and, lot, to, lot, serological, tests, to, detect, antibodies, against, plasmodium, from, the, blood, have, been, developed, but, are, not, used, for, malaria, diagnosis, due, to, their, relatively, poor, sensitivity, and, specificity, highly, sensitive, nucleic, acid, amplification, tests, have, been, developed, but, are, not, used, clinically, due, to, their, relatively, high, cost, and, poor, specificity, for, active, infections, malaria, is, classified, into, either, severe, or, uncomplicated, by, the, world, health, organization, who, it, is, deemed, severe, when, any, of, the, following, criteria, are, present, otherwise, it, is, considered, uncomplicated, cerebral, malaria, is, defined, as, a, severe, p, falciparum, malaria, presenting, with, neurological, symptoms, including, coma, with, a, glasgow, coma, scale, less, than, 11, or, a, blantyre, coma, scale, less, than, 3, or, with, a, coma, that, lasts, longer, than, 30, minutes, after, a, seizure, methods, used, to, prevent, malaria, include, medications, mosquito, elimination, and, the, prevention, of, bites, as, of, 2023, there, are, two, malaria, vaccines, approved, for, use, in, children, by, the, who, rts, s, and, r21, the, presence, of, malaria, in, an, area, requires, a, combination, of, high, human, population, density, high, anopheles, mosquito, population, density, and, high, rates, of, transmission, from, humans, to, mosquitoes, and, from, mosquitoes, to, humans, if, any, of, these, is, lowered, sufficiently, the, parasite, eventually, disappears, from, that, area, as, happened, in, north, america, europe, and, parts, of, the, middle, east, however, unless, the, parasite, is, eliminated, from, the, whole, world, it, could, re, establish, if, conditions, revert, to, a, combination, that, favors, the, parasite, s, reproduction, furthermore, the, cost, per, person, of, eliminating, anopheles, mosquitoes, rises, with, decreasing, population, density, making, it, economically, unfeasible, in, some, areas, prevention, of, malaria, may, be, more, cost, effective, than, treatment, of, the, disease, in, the, long, run, but, the, initial, costs, required, are, out, of, reach, of, many, of, the, world, s, poorest, people, there, is, a, wide, difference, in, the, costs, of, control, i, e, maintenance, of, low, endemicity, and, elimination, programs, between, countries, for, example, in, china, whose, government, in, 2010, announced, a, strategy, to, pursue, malaria, elimination, in, the, chinese, provinces, the, required, investment, is, a, small, proportion, of, public, expenditure, on, health, in, contrast, a, similar, programme, in, tanzania, would, cost, an, estimated, one, fifth, of, the, public, health, budget, in, 2021, the, world, health, organization, confirmed, that, china, has, eliminated, malaria, in, 2023, the, world, health, organization, confirmed, that, azerbaijan, tajikistan, and, belize, have, eliminated, malaria, in, areas, where, malaria, is, common, children, under, five, years, old, often, have, anaemia, which, is, sometimes, due, to, malaria, giving, children, with, anaemia, in, these, areas, preventive, antimalarial, medication, improves, red, blood, cell, levels, slightly, but, does, not, affect, the, risk, of, death, or, need, for, hospitalisation, vector, control, refers, to, methods, used, to, decrease, malaria, by, reducing, the, levels, of, transmission, by, mosquitoes, for, individual, protection, the, most, effective, insect, repellents, are, based, on, deet, or, picaridin, however, there, is, insufficient, evidence, that, mosquito, repellents, can, prevent, malaria, infection, insecticide, treated, nets, itns, and, indoor, residual, spraying, irs, are, effective, have, been, commonly, used, to, prevent, malaria, and, their, use, has, contributed, significantly, to, the, decrease, in, malaria, in, the, 21st, century, itns, and, irs, may, not, be, sufficient, to, eliminate, the, disease, as, these, interventions, depend, on, how, many, people, use, nets, how, many, gaps, in, insecticide, there, are, low, coverage, areas, if, people, are, not, protected, when, outside, of, the, home, and, an, increase, in, mosquitoes, that, are, resistant, to, insecticides, modifications, to, people, s, houses, to, prevent, mosquito, exposure, may, be, an, important, long, term, prevention, measure, mosquito, nets, help, keep, mosquitoes, away, from, people, and, reduce, infection, rates, and, transmission, of, malaria, nets, are, not, a, perfect, barrier, and, are, often, treated, with, an, insecticide, designed, to, kill, the, mosquito, before, it, has, time, to, find, a, way, past, the, net, insecticide, treated, nets, itns, are, estimated, to, be, twice, as, effective, as, untreated, nets, and, offer, greater, than, 70, protection, compared, with, no, net, between, 2000, and, 2008, the, use, of, itns, saved, the, lives, of, an, estimated, 250, 000, infants, in, sub, saharan, africa, according, to, unicef, only, 36, of, households, had, sufficient, itns, for, all, household, members, in, 2019, in, 2000, 1, 7, million, 1, 8, african, children, living, in, areas, of, the, world, where, malaria, is, common, were, protected, by, an, itn, that, number, increased, to, 20, 3, million, 18, 5, african, children, using, itns, in, 2007, leaving, 89, 6, million, children, unprotected, and, to, 68, african, children, using, mosquito, nets, in, 2015, the, percentage, of, children, sleeping, under, itns, in, sub, saharan, africa, increased, from, less, than, 40, in, 2011, to, over, 50, in, 2021, most, nets, are, impregnated, with, pyrethroids, a, class, of, insecticides, with, low, toxicity, they, are, most, effective, when, used, from, dusk, to, dawn, it, is, recommended, to, hang, a, large, bed, net, above, the, center, of, a, bed, and, either, tuck, the, edges, under, the, mattress, or, make, sure, it, is, large, enough, such, that, it, touches, the, ground, itns, are, beneficial, towards, pregnancy, outcomes, in, malaria, endemic, regions, in, africa, but, more, data, is, needed, in, asia, and, latin, america, in, areas, of, high, malaria, resistance, piperonyl, butoxide, pbo, combined, with, pyrethroids, in, mosquito, netting, is, effective, in, reducing, malaria, infection, rates, questions, remain, concerning, the, durability, of, pbo, on, nets, as, the, impact, on, mosquito, mortality, was, not, sustained, after, twenty, washes, in, experimental, trials, unicef, notes, that, the, use, of, insecticide, treated, nets, has, been, increased, since, 2000, through, accelerated, production, procurement, and, delivery, stating, that, over, 2, 5, billion, itns, have, been, distributed, globally, since, 2004, with, 87, 2, 2, billion, distributed, in, sub, saharan, africa, in, 2021, manufacturers, delivered, about, 220, million, itns, to, malaria, endemic, countries, a, decrease, of, 9, million, itns, compared, with, 2020, and, 33, million, less, than, were, delivered, in, 2019, as, of, 2021, 66, of, households, in, sub, saharan, africa, had, itns, with, figures, ranging, from, 31, per, cent, in, angola, in, 2016, to, approximately, 97, per, cent, in, guinea, bissau, in, 2019, slightly, more, than, half, of, the, households, with, an, itn, had, enough, of, them, to, protect, all, members, of, the, household, however, indoor, residual, spraying, is, the, spraying, of, insecticides, on, the, walls, inside, a, home, after, feeding, many, mosquitoes, rest, on, a, nearby, surface, while, digesting, the, bloodmeal, so, if, the, walls, of, houses, have, been, coated, with, insecticides, the, resting, mosquitoes, can, be, killed, before, they, can, bite, another, person, and, transfer, the, malaria, parasite, as, of, 2006, the, world, health, organization, recommends, 12, insecticides, in, irs, operations, including, ddt, and, the, pyrethroids, cyfluthrin, and, deltamethrin, this, public, health, use, of, small, amounts, of, ddt, is, permitted, under, the, stockholm, convention, which, prohibits, its, agricultural, use, one, problem, with, all, forms, of, irs, is, insecticide, resistance, mosquitoes, affected, by, irs, tend, to, rest, and, live, indoors, and, due, to, the, irritation, caused, by, spraying, their, descendants, tend, to, rest, and, live, outdoors, meaning, that, they, are, less, affected, by, the, irs, communities, using, insecticide, treated, nets, in, addition, to, indoor, residual, spraying, with, non, pyrethroid, like, insecticides, found, associated, reductions, in, malaria, additionally, the, use, of, pyrethroid, like, insecticides, in, addition, to, indoor, residual, spraying, did, not, result, in, a, detectable, additional, benefit, in, communities, using, insecticide, treated, nets, housing, is, a, risk, factor, for, malaria, and, modifying, the, house, as, a, prevention, measure, may, be, a, sustainable, strategy, that, does, not, rely, on, the, effectiveness, of, insecticides, such, as, pyrethroids, the, physical, environment, inside, and, outside, the, home, that, may, improve, the, density, of, mosquitoes, are, considerations, examples, of, potential, modifications, include, how, close, the, home, is, to, mosquito, breeding, sites, drainage, and, water, supply, near, the, home, availability, of, mosquito, resting, sites, vegetation, around, the, home, the, proximity, to, live, stock, and, domestic, animals, and, physical, improvements, or, modifications, to, the, design, of, the, home, to, prevent, mosquitoes, from, entering, such, as, window, screens, in, addition, to, installing, window, screens, house, screening, measures, include, screening, ceilings, doors, and, eaves, in, 2021, the, world, health, organization, s, who, guideline, development, group, conditionally, recommended, screening, houses, in, this, manner, to, reduce, malaria, transmission, however, the, who, does, point, out, that, there, are, local, considerations, that, need, to, be, addressed, when, incorporating, these, techniques, these, considerations, include, the, delivery, method, maintenance, house, design, feasibility, resource, needs, and, scalability, several, studies, have, suggested, that, screening, houses, can, have, a, significant, impact, on, malaria, transmission, beyond, the, protective, barrier, screening, provides, it, also, does, not, call, for, daily, behavioral, changes, in, the, household, screening, eaves, can, also, have, a, community, level, protective, effect, ultimately, reducing, mosquito, biting, densities, in, neighboring, houses, that, do, not, have, this, intervention, in, place, in, some, cases, studies, have, used, insecticide, treated, e, g, transfluthrin, or, untreated, netting, to, deter, mosquito, entry, one, widely, used, intervention, is, the, in2care, bv, eavetube, in, 2021, in2care, bv, received, funding, from, the, united, states, agency, for, international, development, to, develop, a, ventilation, tube, that, would, be, installed, in, housing, walls, when, mosquitoes, approach, households, the, goal, is, for, them, to, encounter, these, eavetubes, instead, inside, these, eavetubes, is, insecticide, treated, netting, that, is, lethal, to, insecticide, resistant, mosquitoes, this, approach, to, mosquito, control, is, called, the, lethal, house, lure, method, the, who, is, currently, evaluating, the, efficacy, of, this, product, for, widespread, use, mass, drug, administration, mda, involves, the, administration, of, drugs, to, the, entire, population, of, an, area, regardless, of, disease, status, a, 2021, cochrane, review, on, the, use, of, community, administration, of, ivermectin, found, that, to, date, low, quality, evidence, shows, no, significant, impact, on, reducing, incidence, of, malaria, transmission, from, the, community, administration, of, ivermectin, people, have, tried, a, number, of, other, methods, to, reduce, mosquito, bites, and, slow, the, spread, of, malaria, efforts, to, decrease, mosquito, larvae, by, decreasing, the, availability, of, open, water, where, they, develop, or, by, adding, substances, to, decrease, their, development, are, effective, in, some, locations, electronic, mosquito, repellent, devices, which, make, very, high, frequency, sounds, that, are, supposed, to, keep, female, mosquitoes, away, have, no, supporting, evidence, of, effectiveness, there, is, a, low, certainty, evidence, that, fogging, may, have, an, effect, on, malaria, transmission, larviciding, by, hand, delivery, of, chemical, or, microbial, insecticides, into, water, bodies, containing, low, larval, distribution, may, reduce, malarial, transmission, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, determine, whether, larvivorous, fish, can, decrease, mosquito, density, and, transmission, in, the, area, there, are, a, number, of, medications, that, can, help, prevent, or, interrupt, malaria, in, travellers, to, places, where, infection, is, common, many, of, these, medications, are, also, used, in, treatment, in, places, where, plasmodium, is, resistant, to, one, or, more, medications, three, medications, mefloquine, doxycycline, or, the, combination, of, atovaquone, proguanil, malarone, are, frequently, used, for, prevention, doxycycline, and, the, atovaquone, proguanil, are, better, tolerated, while, mefloquine, is, taken, once, a, week, areas, of, the, world, with, chloroquine, sensitive, malaria, are, uncommon, antimalarial, mass, drug, administration, to, an, entire, population, at, the, same, time, may, reduce, the, risk, of, contracting, malaria, in, the, population, however, the, effectiveness, of, mass, drug, administration, may, vary, depending, on, the, prevalence, of, malaria, in, the, area, other, factors, such, as, drug, administration, plus, other, protective, measures, such, as, mosquito, control, the, proportion, of, people, treated, in, the, area, and, the, risk, of, reinfection, with, malaria, may, play, a, role, in, the, effectiveness, of, mass, drug, treatment, approaches, the, protective, effect, does, not, begin, immediately, and, people, visiting, areas, where, malaria, exists, usually, start, taking, the, drugs, one, to, two, weeks, before, they, arrive, and, continue, taking, them, for, four, weeks, after, leaving, except, for, atovaquone, proguanil, which, only, needs, to, be, started, two, days, before, and, continued, for, seven, days, afterward, the, use, of, preventive, drugs, is, often, not, practical, for, those, who, live, in, areas, where, malaria, exists, and, their, use, is, usually, given, only, to, pregnant, women, and, short, term, visitors, this, is, due, to, the, cost, of, the, drugs, side, effects, from, long, term, use, and, the, difficulty, in, obtaining, antimalarial, drugs, outside, of, wealthy, nations, during, pregnancy, medication, to, prevent, malaria, has, been, found, to, improve, the, weight, of, the, baby, at, birth, and, decrease, the, risk, of, anaemia, in, the, mother, the, use, of, preventive, drugs, where, malaria, bearing, mosquitoes, are, present, may, encourage, the, development, of, partial, resistance, giving, antimalarial, drugs, to, infants, through, intermittent, preventive, therapy, can, reduce, the, risk, of, having, malaria, infection, hospital, admission, and, anaemia, mefloquine, is, more, effective, than, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, in, preventing, malaria, for, hiv, negative, pregnant, women, cotrimoxazole, is, effective, in, preventing, malaria, infection, and, reduce, the, risk, of, getting, anaemia, in, hiv, positive, women, giving, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, for, three, or, more, doses, as, intermittent, preventive, therapy, is, superior, than, two, doses, for, hiv, positive, women, living, in, malaria, endemic, areas, prompt, treatment, of, confirmed, cases, with, artemisinin, based, combination, therapies, acts, may, also, reduce, transmission, malaria, vaccines, have, been, another, goal, of, research, the, first, promising, studies, demonstrating, the, potential, for, a, malaria, vaccine, were, performed, in, 1967, by, immunising, mice, with, live, radiation, attenuated, sporozoites, which, provided, significant, protection, to, the, mice, upon, subsequent, injection, with, normal, viable, sporozoites, since, the, 1970s, there, has, been, considerable, progress, in, developing, similar, vaccination, strategies, for, humans, in, 2013, who, and, the, malaria, vaccine, funders, group, set, a, goal, to, develop, vaccines, designed, to, interrupt, malaria, transmission, with, malaria, eradication, s, long, term, goal, the, first, vaccine, called, rts, s, was, approved, by, european, regulators, in, 2015, as, of, 2023, two, malaria, vaccines, have, been, licensed, for, use, other, approaches, to, combat, malaria, may, require, investing, more, in, research, and, greater, primary, health, care, continuing, surveillance, will, also, be, important, to, prevent, the, return, of, malaria, in, countries, where, the, disease, has, been, eliminated, as, of, 2019, it, is, undergoing, pilot, trials, in, 3, sub, saharan, african, countries, ghana, kenya, and, malawi, as, part, of, the, who, s, malaria, vaccine, implementation, programme, mvip, immunity, or, more, accurately, tolerance, to, p, falciparum, malaria, does, occur, naturally, but, only, in, response, to, years, of, repeated, infection, an, individual, can, be, protected, from, a, p, falciparum, infection, if, they, receive, about, a, thousand, bites, from, mosquitoes, that, carry, a, version, of, the, parasite, rendered, non, infective, by, a, dose, of, x, ray, irradiation, the, highly, polymorphic, nature, of, many, p, falciparum, proteins, results, in, significant, challenges, to, vaccine, design, vaccine, candidates, that, target, antigens, on, gametes, zygotes, or, ookinetes, in, the, mosquito, midgut, aim, to, block, the, transmission, of, malaria, these, transmission, blocking, vaccines, induce, antibodies, in, the, human, blood, when, a, mosquito, takes, a, blood, meal, from, a, protected, individual, these, antibodies, prevent, the, parasite, from, completing, its, development, in, the, mosquito, other, vaccine, candidates, targeting, the, blood, stage, of, the, parasite, s, life, cycle, have, been, inadequate, on, their, own, for, example, spf66, was, tested, extensively, in, areas, where, the, disease, was, common, in, the, 1990s, but, trials, showed, it, to, be, insufficiently, effective, as, of, 2020, the, rts, s, vaccine, has, been, shown, to, reduce, the, risk, of, malaria, by, about, 40, in, children, in, africa, a, preprint, study, of, the, r21, vaccine, has, shown, 77, vaccine, efficacy, in, 2021, researchers, from, the, university, of, oxford, reported, findings, from, a, phase, iib, trial, of, a, candidate, malaria, vaccine, r21, matrix, m, which, demonstrated,

inform, people, to, cover, over, areas, of, stagnant, still, water, such, as, water, tanks, that, are, ideal, breeding, grounds, for, the, parasite, and, mosquito, thus, cutting, down, the, risk, of, the, transmission, between, people, this, is, generally, used, in, urban, areas, where, there, are, large, centers, of, population, in, a, confined, space, and, transmission, would, be, most, likely, in, these, areas, intermittent, preventive, therapy, is, another, intervention, that, has, been, used, successfully, to, control, malaria, in, pregnant, women, and, infants, and, in, preschool, children, where, transmission, is, seasonal, malaria, is, treated, with, antimalarial, medications, the, ones, used, depends, on, the, type, and, severity, of, the, disease, while, medications, against, fever, are, commonly, used, their, effects, on, outcomes, are, not, clear, providing, free, antimalarial, drugs, to, households, may, reduce, childhood, deaths, when, used, appropriately, programmes, which, presumptively, treat, all, causes, of, fever, with, antimalarial, drugs, may, lead, to, overuse, of, antimalarials, and, undertreat, other, causes, of, fever, nevertheless, the, use, of, malaria, rapid, diagnostic, kits, can, help, to, reduce, over, usage, of, antimalarials, simple, or, uncomplicated, malaria, may, be, treated, with, oral, medications, artemisinin, drugs, are, effective, and, safe, in, treating, uncomplicated, malaria, artemisinin, in, combination, with, other, antimalarials, known, as, artemisinin, combination, therapy, or, act, is, about, 90, effective, when, used, to, treat, uncomplicated, malaria, the, most, effective, treatment, for, p, falciparum, infection, is, the, use, of, act, which, decreases, resistance, to, any, single, drug, component, artemether, lumefantrine, six, dose, regimen, is, more, effective, than, the, artemether, lumefantrine, four, dose, regimen, or, other, regimens, not, containing, artemisinin, derivatives, in, treating, falciparum, malaria, another, recommended, combination, is, dihydroartemisinin, and, piperaquine, artemisinin, naphthoquine, combination, therapy, showed, promising, results, in, treating, falciparum, malaria, but, more, research, is, needed, to, establish, its, efficacy, as, a, reliable, treatment, artesunate, plus, mefloquine, performs, better, than, mefloquine, alone, in, treating, uncomplicated, falciparum, malaria, in, low, transmission, settings, atovaquone, proguanil, is, effective, against, uncomplicated, falciparum, with, a, possible, failure, rate, of, 5, to, 10, the, addition, of, artesunate, may, reduce, failure, rate, azithromycin, monotherapy, or, combination, therapy, has, not, shown, effectiveness, in, treating, plasmodium, falciparum, or, plasmodium, vivax, malaria, amodiaquine, plus, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, may, achieve, less, treatment, failures, when, compared, to, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, alone, in, uncomplicated, falciparum, malaria, there, is, insufficient, data, on, chlorproguanil, dapsone, in, treating, uncomplicated, falciparum, malaria, the, addition, of, primaquine, with, artemisinin, based, combination, therapy, for, falciparum, malaria, reduces, its, transmission, at, day, 3, 4, and, day, 8, of, infection, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, plus, artesunate, is, better, than, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, plus, amodiaquine, in, controlling, treatment, failure, at, day, 28, however, the, latter, is, better, than, the, former, in, reducing, gametocytes, in, blood, at, day, 7, infection, with, p, vivax, p, ovale, or, p, malariae, usually, does, not, require, hospitalisation, treatment, of, p, vivax, malaria, requires, both, elimination, of, the, parasite, in, the, blood, with, chloroquine, or, with, artemisinin, based, combination, therapy, and, clearance, of, parasites, from, the, liver, with, an, 8, aminoquinoline, agent, such, as, primaquine, or, tafenoquine, these, two, drugs, act, against,

efficacious, as, quinine, in, the, treatment, of, cerebral, malaria, in, children, treatment, of, severe, malaria, involves, supportive, measures, that, are, best, done, in, a, critical, care, unit, this, includes, the, management, of, high, fevers, and, the, seizures, that, may, result, from, it, it, also, includes, monitoring, for, poor, breathing, effort, low, blood, sugar, and, low, blood, potassium, artemisinin, derivatives, have, the, same, or, better, efficacy, than, quinolones, in, preventing, deaths, in, severe, or, complicated, malaria, quinine, loading, dose, helps, to, shorten, the, duration, of, fever, and, increases, parasite, clearance, from, the, body, there, is, no, difference, in, effectiveness, when, using, intrarectal, quinine, compared, to, intravenous, or,

insufficient, evidence, that, iron, chelating, agents, such, as, deferoxamine, and, deferiprone, improve, outcomes, of, those, with, malaria, falciparum, infection, a, 2022, clinical, trial, shows, that, a, monoclonal, antibody, mab, l9ls, offers, protection, against, malaria, it, binds, the, plasmodium, falciparum, circumsporozoite, protein, csp, 1, essential, to, disease, and, makes, it, ineffective, drug, resistance, poses, a, growing, problem, in, 21st, century, malaria, treatment, in, the, 2000s, decade, malaria, with, partial, resistance, to, artemisins, emerged, in, southeast, asia, resistance, is, now, common, against, all, classes, of, antimalarial, drugs, apart, from, artemisinins, treatment, of, resistant, strains, became, increasingly, dependent, on, this, class, of, drugs, the, cost, of, artemisinins, limits, their, use, in, the, developing, world, malaria, strains, found, on, the, cambodia, thailand, border, are, resistant, to, combination, therapies, that, include, artemisinins, and, may, therefore, be, untreatable, exposure, of, the, parasite, population, to, artemisinin, monotherapies, in, subtherapeutic, doses, for, over, 30, years, and, the, availability, of, substandard, artemisinins, likely, drove, the, selection, of, the, resistant, phenotype, resistance, to, artemisinin, has, been, detected, in, cambodia, myanmar, thailand, and, vietnam, and, there, has, been, emerging, resistance, in, laos, resistance, to, the, combination, of, artemisinin, and, piperaquine, was, first, detected, in, 2013, in, cambodia, and, by, 2019, had, spread, across, cambodia, and, into, laos, thailand, and, vietnam, with, up, to, 80, percent, of, malaria, parasites, resistant, in, some, regions, there, is, insufficient, evidence, in, unit, packaged, antimalarial, drugs, in, preventing, treatment, failures, of, malaria, infection, however, if, supported, by, training, of, healthcare, providers, and, patient, information, there, is, improvement, in, compliance, of, those, receiving, treatment, when, properly, treated, people, with, malaria, can, usually, expect, a, complete, recovery, however, severe, malaria, can, progress, extremely, rapidly, and, cause, death, within, hours, or, days, in, the, most, severe, cases, of, the, disease, fatality, rates, can, reach, 20, even, with, intensive, care, and, treatment, over, the, longer, term, developmental, impairments, have, been, documented, in, children, who, have, had, episodes, of, severe, malaria, chronic, infection, without, severe, disease, can, occur, in, an, immune,

case, was, tajikistan, in, 2014, there, are, about, 1300, 1500, malaria, cases, per, year, in, the, united, states, the, united, states, eradicated, malaria, as, a, major, public, health, concern, in, 1951, though, small, outbreaks, persist, locally, acquired, mosquito, borne, malaria, occurred, in, the, united, states, in, 2003, when, eight, cases, of, locally, acquired, p, vivax, malaria, were, identified, in, florida, and, again, in, may, 2023, in, four, cases, as, well, as, one, case, in, texas, and, in, august, in, one, case, in, maryland, about, 900, people, died, from, the, disease, in, europe, between, 1993, and, 2003, both, the, global, incidence, of, disease, and, resulting, mortality, have, declined, in, recent, years, according, to, the, who, and, unicef, deaths, attributable, to, malaria, in, 2015, were, reduced, by, 60, from, a, 2000, estimate, of, 985, 000, largely, due, to, the, widespread, use, of, insecticide, treated, nets, and, artemisinin, based, combination, therapies, between, 2000, and, 2019, malaria, mortality, rates, among, all, ages, halved, from, about, 30, to, 13, per, 100, 000, population, at, risk, during, this, period, malaria, deaths, among, children, under, five, also, declined, by, nearly, half, 47, from, 781, 000, in, 2000, to, 416, 000, in, 2019, malaria, is, presently, endemic, in, a, broad, band, around, the, equator, in, areas, of, the, americas, many, parts, of, asia, and, much, of, africa, in, sub, saharan, africa, 85, 90, of, malaria, fatalities, occur, an, estimate, for, 2009, reported, that, countries, with, the, highest, death, rate, per, 100, 000, of, population, were, ivory, coast, 86, 15, angola, 56, 93, and, burkina, faso, 50, 66, a, 2010, estimate, indicated, the, deadliest, countries, per, population, were, burkina, faso, mozambique, and, mali, the, malaria, atlas, project, aims, to, map, global, levels, of, malaria, providing, a, way, to, determine, the, global, spatial, limits, of, the, disease, and, to, assess, disease, burden, this, effort, led, to, the, publication, of, a, map, of, p, falciparum, endemicity, in, 2010, and, an, update, in, 2019, as, of, 2021, 84, countries, have, endemic, malaria, the, geographic, distribution, of, malaria, within, large, regions, is, complex, and, malaria, afflicted, and, malaria, free, areas, are, often, found, close, to, each, other, malaria, is, prevalent, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, because, of, rainfall, consistent, high, temperatures, and, high, humidity, along, with, stagnant, waters, where, mosquito, larvae, readily, mature, providing, them, with, the, environment, they, need, for, continuous, breeding, in, drier, areas, outbreaks, of, malaria, have, been, predicted, with, reasonable, accuracy, by, mapping, rainfall, malaria, is, more, common, in, rural, areas, than, in, cities, for, example, several, cities, in, the, greater, mekong, subregion, of, southeast, asia, are, essentially, malaria, free, but, the, disease, is, prevalent, in, many, rural, regions, including, along, international, borders, and, forest, fringes, in, contrast, malaria, in, africa, is, present, in, both, rural, and, urban, areas, though, the, risk, is, lower, in, the, larger, cities, climate, change, is, likely, to, affect, malaria, transmission, but, the, degree, of, effect, and, the, areas, affected, is, uncertain, greater, rainfall, in, certain, areas, of, india, and, following, an, el, ni, o, event, is, associated, with, increased, mosquito, numbers, since, 1900, there, has, been, substantial, change, in, temperature, and, rainfall, over, africa, however, factors, that, contribute, to, how, rainfall, results, in, water, for, mosquito, breeding, are, complex, incorporating, the, extent, to, which, it, is, absorbed, into, soil, and, vegetation, for, example, or, rates, of, runoff, and, evaporation, recent, research, has, provided, a, more, in, depth, picture, of, conditions, across, africa, combining, a, malaria, climatic, suitability, model, with, a, continental, scale, model, representing, real, world, hydrological, processes, although, the, parasite, responsible, for, p, falciparum, malaria, has, been, in, existence, for, 50, 000, 100, 000, years, the, population, size, of, the, parasite, did, not, increase, until, about, 10, 000, years, ago, concurrently, with, advances, in, agriculture, and, the, development, of, human, settlements, close, relatives, of, the, human, malaria, parasites, remain, common, in, chimpanzees, some, evidence, suggests, that, the, p, falciparum, malaria, may, have, originated, in, gorillas, references, to, the, unique, periodic, fevers, of, malaria, are, found, throughout, history, ancient, indian, physician, sushruta, is, believed, to, be, among, the, first, to, attribute, the, disease, to, mosquitoes, long, before, the, roman, columella, associated, the, disease, with, insects, from, swamps, hippocrates, described, periodic, fevers, labelling, them, tertian, quartan, subtertian, and, quotidian, malaria, may, have, contributed, to, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, and, was, so, pervasive, in, rome, that, it, was, known, as, the, roman, fever, several, regions, in, ancient, rome, were, considered, at, risk, for, the, disease, because, of, the, favourable, conditions, present, for, malaria, vectors, this, included, areas, such, as, southern, italy, the, island, of, sardinia, the, pontine, marshes, the, lower, regions, of, coastal, etruria, and, the, city, of, rome, along, the, tiber, the, presence, of, stagnant, water, in, these, places, was, preferred, by, mosquitoes, for, breeding, grounds, irrigated, gardens, swamp, like, grounds, run, off, from, agriculture, and, drainage, problems, from, road, construction, led, to, the, increase, of, standing, water, malaria, is, not, referenced, in, the, medical, books, of, the, mayans, or, aztecs, despite, this, antibodies, against, malaria, have, been, detected, in, some, south, american, mummies, indicating, that, some, malaria, strains, in, the, americas, might, have, a, pre, columbian, origin, european, settlers, and, the, west, africans, they, enslaved, likely, brought, malaria, to, the, americas, starting, in, the, 16th, century, scientific, studies, on, malaria, made, their, first, significant, advance, in, 1880, when, charles, louis, alphonse, laveran, a, french, army, doctor, working, in, the, military, hospital, of, constantine, in, algeria, observed, parasites, inside, the, red, blood, cells, of, infected, people, for, the, first, time, he, therefore, proposed, that, malaria, is, caused, by, this, organism, the, first, time, a, protist, was, identified, as, causing, disease, for, this, and, later, discoveries, he, was, awarded, the, 1907, nobel, prize, for, physiology, or, medicine, a, year, later, carlos, finlay, a, cuban, doctor, treating, people, with, yellow, fever, in, havana, provided, strong, evidence, that, mosquitoes, were, transmitting, disease, to, and, from, humans, this, work, followed, earlier, suggestions, by, josiah, c, nott, and, work, by, sir, patrick, manson, the, father, of, tropical, medicine, on, the, transmission, of, filariasis, in, april, 1894, a, scottish, physician, sir, ronald, ross, visited, sir, patrick, manson, at, his, house, on, queen, anne, street, london, this, visit, was, the, start, of, four, years, of, collaboration, and, fervent, research, that, culminated, in, 1897, when, ross, who, was, working, in, the, presidency, general, hospital, in, calcutta, proved, the, complete, life, cycle, of, the, malaria, parasite, in, mosquitoes, he, thus, proved, that, the, mosquito, was, the, vector, for, malaria, in, humans, by, showing, that, certain, mosquito, species, transmit, malaria, to, birds, he, isolated, malaria, parasites, from, the, salivary, glands, of, mosquitoes, that, had, fed, on, infected, birds, for, this, work, ross, received, the, 1902, nobel, prize, in, medicine, after, resigning, from, the, indian, medical, service, ross, worked, at, the, newly, established, liverpool, school, of, tropical, medicine, and, directed, malaria, control, efforts, in, egypt, panama, greece, and, mauritius, the, findings, of, finlay, and, ross, were, later, confirmed, by, a, medical, board, headed, by, walter, reed, in, 1900, its, recommendations, were, implemented, by, william, c, gorgas, in, the, health, measures, undertaken, during, construction, of, the, panama, canal, this, public, health, work, saved, the, lives, of, thousands, of, workers, and, helped, develop, the, methods, used, in, future, public, health, campaigns, against, the, disease, in, 1896, amico, bignami, discussed, the, role, of, mosquitoes, in, malaria, in, 1898, bignami, giovanni, battista, grassi, and, giuseppe, bastianelli, succeeded, in, showing, experimentally, the, transmission, of, malaria, in, humans, using, infected, mosquitoes, to, contract, malaria, themselves, which, they, presented, in, november, 1898, to, the, accademia, dei, lincei, the, first, effective, treatment, for, malaria, came, from, the, bark, of, cinchona, tree, which, contains, quinine, this, tree, grows, on, the, slopes, of, the, andes, mainly, in, peru, the, indigenous, peoples, of, peru, made, a, tincture, of, cinchona, to, control, fever, its, effectiveness, against, malaria, was, found, and, the, jesuits, introduced, the, treatment, to, europe, around, 1640, by, 1677, it, was, included, in, the, london, pharmacopoeia, as, an, antimalarial, treatment, it, was, not, until, 1820, that, the, active, ingredient, quinine, was, extracted, from, the, bark, isolated, and, named, by, the, french, chemists, pierre, joseph, pelletier, and, joseph, bienaim, caventou, quinine, was, the, predominant, malarial, medication, until, the, 1920s, when, other, medications, began, to, appear, in, the, 1940s, chloroquine, replaced, quinine, as, the, treatment, of, both, uncomplicated, and, severe, malaria, until, resistance, supervened, first, in, southeast, asia, and, south, america, in, the, 1950s, and, then, globally, in, the, 1980s, the, medicinal, value, of, artemisia, annua, has, been, used, by, chinese, herbalists, in, traditional, chinese, medicines, for, 2, 000, years, in, 1596, li, shizhen, recommended, tea, made, from, qinghao, specifically, to, treat, malaria, symptoms, in, his, compendium, of, materia, medica, however, the, efficacy, of, tea, made, with, a, annua, for, the, treatment, of, malaria, is, dubious, and, is, discouraged, by, the, world, health, organization, who, artemisinins, discovered, by, chinese, scientist, tu, youyou, and, colleagues, in, the, 1970s, from, the, plant, artemisia, annua, became, the, recommended, treatment, for, p, falciparum, malaria, administered, in, severe, cases, in, combination, with, other, antimalarials, tu, says, she, was, influenced, by, a, traditional, chinese, herbal, medicine, source, the, handbook, of, prescriptions, for, emergency, treatments, written, in, 340, by, ge, hong, for, her, work, on, malaria, tu, youyou, received, the, 2015, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, plasmodium, vivax, was, used, between, 1917, and, the, 1940s, for, malariotherapy, deliberate, injection, of, malaria, parasites, to, induce, a, fever, to, combat, certain, diseases, such, as, tertiary, syphilis, in, 1927, the, inventor, of, this, technique, julius, wagner, jauregg, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, his, discoveries, the, technique, was, dangerous, killing, about, 15, of, patients, so, it, is, no, longer, in, use, the, first, pesticide, used, for, indoor, residual, spraying, was, ddt, although, it, was, initially, used, exclusively, to, combat, malaria, its, use, quickly, spread, to, agriculture, in, time, pest, control, rather, than, disease, control, came, to, dominate, ddt, use, and, this, large, scale, agricultural, use, led, to, the, evolution, of, pesticide, resistant, mosquitoes, in, many, regions, the, ddt, resistance, shown, by, anopheles, mosquitoes, can, be, compared, to, antibiotic, resistance, shown, by, bacteria, during, the, 1960s, awareness, of, the, negative, consequences, of, its, indiscriminate, use, increased, ultimately, leading, to, bans, on, agricultural, applications, of, ddt, in, many, countries, in, the, 1970s, before, ddt, malaria, was, successfully, eliminated, or, controlled, in, tropical, areas, like, brazil, and, egypt, by, removing, or, poisoning, the, breeding, grounds, of, the, mosquitoes, or, the, aquatic, habitats, of, the, larval, stages, for, example, by, applying, the, highly, toxic, arsenic, compound, paris, green, to, places, with, standing, water, various, types, of, malaria, have, been, called, by, the, names, below, malaria, has, been, successfully, eliminated, or, significantly, reduced, in, certain, areas, but, not, globally, malaria, was, once, common, in, the, united, states, but, the, us, eliminated, malaria, from, most, parts, of, the, country, in, the, early, 20th, century, using, vector, control, programs, which, combined, the, monitoring, and, treatment, of, infected, humans, draining, of, wetland, breeding, grounds, for, agriculture, and, other, changes, in, water, management, practices, and, advances, in, sanitation, including, greater, use, of, glass, windows, and, screens, in, dwellings, the, use, of, the, pesticide, ddt, and, other, means, eliminated, malaria, from, the, remaining, pockets, in, southern, states, of, the, us, in, the, 1950s, as, part, of, the, national, malaria, eradication, program, most, of, europe, north, america, australia, north, africa, and, the, caribbean, and, parts, of, south, america, asia, and, southern, africa, have, also, eliminated, malaria, the, who, defines, elimination, or, malaria, free, as, having, no, domestic, transmission, indigenous, cases, for, the, past, three, years, they, also, define, pre, elimination, and, elimination, stages, when, a, country, has, fewer, than, 5, or, 1, respectively, cases, per, 1000, people, at, risk, per, year, in, 2021, the, total, of, international, and, national, funding, for, malaria, control, and, elimination, was, 3, 5, billion, only, half, of, what, is, estimated, to, be, needed, according, to, unicef, to, achieve, the, goal, of, a, malaria, free, world, annual, funding, would, need, to, more, than, double, to, reach, the, us, 6, 8, billion, target, in, parts, of, the, world, with, rising, living, standards, the, elimination, of, malaria, was, often, a, collateral, benefit, of, the, introduction, of, window, screens, and, improved, sanitation, a, variety, of, usually, simultaneous, interventions, represents, best, practice, these, include, antimalarial, drugs, to, prevent, or, treat, infection, improvements, in, public, health, infrastructure, to, diagnose, sequester, and, treat, infected, individuals, bednets, and, other, methods, intended, to, keep, mosquitoes, from, biting, humans, and, vector, control, strategies, such, as, larvaciding, with, insecticides, ecological, controls, such, as, draining, mosquito, breeding, grounds, or, introducing, fish, to, eat, larvae, and, indoor, residual, spraying, irs, with, insecticides, in, 1955, the, who, launched, the, global, malaria, eradication, program, gmep, the, program, relied, largely, on, ddt, for, mosquito, control, and, rapid, diagnosis, and, treatment, to, break, the, transmission, cycle, the, program, eliminated, the, disease, in, north, america, europe, the, former, soviet, union, and, in, taiwan, much, of, the, caribbean, the, balkans, parts, of, northern, africa, the, northern, region, of, australia, and, a, large, swath, of, the, south, pacific, and, dramatically, reduced, mortality, in, sri, lanka, and, india, however, failure, to, sustain, the, program, increasing, mosquito, tolerance, to, ddt, and, increasing, parasite, tolerance, led, to, a, resurgence, in, many, areas, early, successes, partially, or, completely, reversed, and, in, some, cases, rates, of, transmission, increased, experts, tie, malarial, resurgence, to, multiple, factors, including, poor, leadership, management, and, funding, of, malaria, control, programs, poverty, civil, unrest, and, increased, irrigation, the, evolution, of, resistance, to, first, generation, drugs, e, g, chloroquine, and, to, insecticides, exacerbated, the, situation, the, program, succeeded, in, eliminating, malaria, only, in, areas, with, high, socio, economic, status, well, organized, healthcare, systems, and, relatively, less, intensive, or, seasonal, malaria, transmission, for, example, in, sri, lanka, the, program, reduced, cases, from, about, one, million, per, year, before, spraying, to, just, 18, in, 1963, and, 29, in, 1964, thereafter, the, program, was, halted, to, save, money, and, malaria, rebounded, to, 600, 000, cases, in, 1968, and, the, first, quarter, of, 1969, the, country, resumed, ddt, vector, control, but, the, mosquitoes, had, evolved, resistance, in, the, interim, presumably, because, of, continued, agricultural, use, the, program, switched, to, malathion, but, despite, initial, successes, malaria, continued, its, resurgence, into, the, 1980s, due, to, vector, and, parasite, resistance, and, other, factors, the, feasibility, of, eradicating, malaria, with, the, strategy, used, at, the, time, and, resources, available, led, to, waning, support, for, the, program, who, suspended, the, program, in, 1969, and, attention, instead, focused, on, controlling, and, treating, the, disease, spraying, programs, especially, using, ddt, were, curtailed, due, to, concerns, over, safety, and, environmental, effects, as, well, as, problems, in, administrative, managerial, and, financial, implementation, efforts, shifted, from, spraying, to, the, use, of, bednets, impregnated, with, insecticides, and, other, interventions, target, 6c, of, the, millennium, development, goals, included, reversal, of, the, global, increase, in, malaria, incidence, by, 2015, with, specific, targets, for, children, under, five, years, old, since, 2000, support, for, malaria, eradication, increased, although, some, actors, in, the, global, health, community, including, voices, within, the, who, view, malaria, eradication, as, a, premature, goal, and, suggest, that, the, establishment, of, strict, deadlines, for, malaria, eradication, may, be, counterproductive, as, they, are, likely, to, be, missed, one, of, the, targets, of, goal, 3, of, the, un, s, sustainable, development, goals, is, to, end, the, malaria, epidemic, in, all, countries, by, 2030, in, 2006, the, organization, malaria, no, more, set, a, public, goal, of, eliminating, malaria, from, africa, by, 2015, and, the, organization, claimed, they, planned, to, dissolve, if, that, goal, was, accomplished, in, 2007, world, malaria, day, was, established, by, the, 60th, session, of, the, world, health, assembly, as, of, 2018, they, are, still, functioning, as, of, 2012, the, global, fund, to, fight, aids, tuberculosis, and, malaria, has, distributed, 230, million, insecticide,

missed, with, a, slight, increase, in, cases, compared, to, 2015, additionally, unicef, reported, that, the, number, of, malaria, deaths, for, all, ages, increased, by, 10, between, 2019, and, 2020, in, part, due, to, service, disruptions, related, to, the, covid, 19, pandemic, before, experiencing, a, minor, decline, in, 2021, before, 2016, the, global, fund, against, hiv, aids, tuberculosis, and, malaria, had, provided, 659, million, itn, insecticide, treated, bed, nets, organise, support, and, education, to, prevents, malaria, the, challenges, are, high, due, to, the, lack, of, funds,

were, estimated, to, be, on, track, with, the, who, goals, for, 2020, 15, countries, reported, an, increase, of, 40, or, more, between, 2015, and, 2020, between, 2000, and, 30, june, 2021, twelve, countries, were, certified, by, the, who, as, being, malaria, free, argentina, and, algeria, were, declared, free, of, malaria, in, 2019, el, salvador, and, china, were, declared, malaria, free, in, the, first, half, of, 2021, regional, disparities, were, evident, southeast, asia, was, on, track, to, meet, who, s, 2020, goals, while, africa, americas, eastern, mediterranean, and, west, pacific, regions, were, off, track, the, six, greater, mekong, subregion, countries, aim, for, elimination, of, p, falciparum, transmitted, malaria, by, 2025, and, elimination, of, all, malaria, by, 2030, having, achieved, a, 97, and, 90, reduction, of, cases, respectively, since, 2000, ahead, of, world, malaria, day, 25, april, 2021, who, named, 25, countries, in, which, it, is, working, to, eliminate, malaria, by, 2025, as, part, of, its, e, 2025, initiative, a, major, challenge, to, malaria, elimination, is, the, persistence, of, malaria, in, border, regions, making, international, cooperation, crucial, in, 2018, who, announced, that, paraguay, was, free, of, malaria, after, a, national, malaria, eradication, effort, that, began, in, 1950, in, march, 2023, the, who, certified, azerbaijan, and, tajikistan, as, malaria, free, and, belize, in, june, 2023, cabo, verde, the, latest, country, to, eradicate, malaria, was, certified, in, january, 2024, bringing, the, total, number, of, countries, and, territories, certified, malaria, free, to, 44, experts, say, that, malaria, could, be, eliminated, as, wild, disease, of, humans, by, the, year, 2050, world, class, experts, 41, of, them, in, fields, such, as, malariology, biomedicine, economics, and, health, policy, advocated, more, funding, a, central, data, repository, for, dealing, with, local, outbreaks, of, malaria, and, training, the, workers, needed, to, carry, out, the, plan, details, are, published, in, the, lancet, the, report, refers, to, current, knowledge, recent, research, and, financial, matters, to, describe, a, respectable, plan, the, number, of, countries, in, which, malaria, was, endemic, was, reduced, from, 200, to, 86, in, the, years, from, 1900, to, 2017, a, further, reduction, by, another, 20, countries, occurred, by, 2020, in, light, of, the, indication, of, possible, practical, accomplishment, countries, and, regions, are, planning, further, progress, through, the, use, of, top, notch, diagnostic, technique, effective, treatment, and, vector, reduction, the, world, should, be, nearly, free, of, malaria, by, 2050, this, will, require, technical, improvements, in, organizational, efficiency, and, more, monetary, outlays, malaria, is, not, just, a, disease, commonly, associated, with, poverty, some, evidence, suggests, that, it, is, also, a, cause, of, poverty, and, a, major, hindrance, to, economic, development, although, tropical, regions, are, most, affected, malaria, s, furthest, influence, reaches, into, some, temperate, zones, that, have, extreme, seasonal, changes, the, disease, has, been, associated, with, major, negative, economic, effects, on, regions, where, it, is, widespread, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, it, was, a, major, factor, in, the, slow, economic, development, of, the, american, southern, states, a, comparison, of, average, per, capita, gdp, in, 1995, adjusted, for, parity, of, purchasing, power, between, countries, with, malaria, and, countries, without, malaria, gives, a, fivefold, difference, us, 1, 526, versus, us, 8, 268, in, the, period, 1965, to, 1990, countries, where, malaria, was, common, had, an, average, per, capita, gdp, that, increased, only, 0, 4, per, year, compared, to, 2, 4, per, year, in, other, countries, poverty, can, increase, the, risk, of, malaria, since, those, in, poverty, do, not, have, the, financial, capacities, to, prevent, or, treat, the, disease, in, its, entirety, the, economic, impact, of, malaria, has, been, estimated, to, cost, africa, us, 12, billion, every, year, the, economic, impact, includes, costs, of, health, care, working, days, lost, due, to, sickness, days, lost, in, education, decreased, productivity, due, to, brain, damage, from, cerebral, malaria, and, loss, of, investment, and, tourism, the, disease, has, a, heavy, burden, in, some, countries, where, it, may, be, responsible, for, 30, 50, of, hospital, admissions, up, to, 50, of, outpatient, visits, and, up, to, 40, of, public, health, spending, cerebral, malaria, is, one, of, the, leading, causes, of, neurological, disabilities, in, african, children, studies, comparing, cognitive, functions, before, and, after, treatment, for, severe, malarial, illness, continued, to, show, significantly, impaired, school, performance, and, cognitive, abilities, even, after, recovery, consequently, severe, and, cerebral, malaria, have, far, reaching, socioeconomic, consequences, that, extend, beyond, the, immediate, effects, of, the, disease, sophisticated, counterfeits, have, been, found, in, several, asian, countries, such, as, cambodia, china, indonesia, laos, thailand, and, vietnam, and, are, a, major, cause, of, avoidable, death, in, those, countries, the, who, said, that, studies, indicate, that, up, to, 40, of, artesunate, based, malaria, medications, are, counterfeit, especially, in, the, greater, mekong, region, they, have, established, a, rapid, alert, system, to, rapidly, report, information, about, counterfeit, drugs, to, relevant, authorities, in, participating, countries, there, is, no, reliable, way, for, doctors, or, lay, people, to, detect, counterfeit, drugs, without, help, from, a, laboratory, companies, are, attempting, to, combat, the, persistence, of, counterfeit, drugs, by, using, new, technology, to, provide, security, from, source, to, distribution, another, clinical, and, public, health, concern, is, the, proliferation, of, substandard, antimalarial, medicines, resulting, from, inappropriate, concentration, of, ingredients, contamination, with, other, drugs, or, toxic, impurities, poor, quality, ingredients, poor, stability, and, inadequate, packaging, a, 2012, study, demonstrated, that, roughly, one, third, of, antimalarial, medications, in, southeast, asia, and, sub, saharan, africa, failed, chemical, analysis, packaging, analysis, or, were, falsified, throughout, history, the, contraction, of, malaria, has, played, a, prominent, role, in, the, fates, of, government, rulers, nation, states, military, personnel, and, military, actions, in, 1910, nobel, prize, in, medicine, winner, ronald, ross, himself, a, malaria, survivor, published, a, book, titled, the, prevention, of, malaria, that, included, a, chapter, titled, the, prevention, of, malaria, in, war, the, chapter, s, author, colonel, c, h, melville, professor, of, hygiene, at, royal, army, medical, college, in, london, addressed, the, prominent, role, that, malaria, has, historically, played, during, wars, the, history, of, malaria, in, war, might, almost, be, taken, to, be, the, history, of, war, itself, certainly, the, history, of, war, in, the, christian, era, it, is, probably, the, case, that, many, of, the, so, called, camp, fevers, and, probably, also, a, considerable, proportion, of, the, camp, dysentery, of, the, wars, of, the, sixteenth, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, were, malarial, in, origin, in, british, occupied, india, the, cocktail, gin, and, tonic, may, have, come, about, as, a, way, of, taking, quinine, known, for, its, antimalarial, properties, malaria, was, the, most, significant, health, hazard, encountered, by, u, s, troops, in, the, south, pacific, during, world, war, ii, where, about, 500, 000, men, were, infected, according, to, joseph, patrick, byrne, sixty, thousand, american, soldiers, died, of, malaria, during, the, african, and, south, pacific, campaigns, significant, financial, investments, have, been, made, to, procure, existing, and, create, new, antimalarial, agents, during, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, inconsistent, supplies, of, the, natural, antimalaria, drugs, cinchona, bark, and, quinine, prompted, substantial, funding, into, research, and, development, of, other, drugs, and, vaccines, american, military, organisations, conducting, such, research, initiatives, include, the, navy, medical, research, center, walter, reed, army, institute, of, research, and, the, u, s, army, medical, research, institute, of, infectious, diseases, of, the, us, armed, forces, additionally, initiatives, have, been, founded, such, as, malaria, control, in, war, areas, mcwa, established, in, 1942, and, its, successor, the, communicable, disease, center, now, known, as, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, or, cdc, established, in, 1946, according, to, the, cdc, mcwa, was, established, to, control, malaria, around, military, training, bases, in, the, southern, united, states, and, its, territories, where, malaria, was, still, problematic, the, malaria, eradication, research, agenda, malera, initiative, was, a, consultative, process, to, identify, which, areas, of, research, and, development, r, d, must, be, addressed, for, worldwide, eradication, of, malaria, malaria, parasites, contain, apicoplasts, organelles, related, to, the, plastids, found, in, plants, complete, with, their, own, genomes, these, apicoplasts, are, thought, to, have, originated, through, the, endosymbiosis, of, algae, and, play, a, crucial, role, in, various, aspects, of, parasite, metabolism, such, as, fatty, acid, biosynthesis, over, 400, proteins, have, been, found, to, be, produced, by, apicoplasts, and, these, are, now, being, investigated, as, possible, targets, for, novel, antimalarial, drugs, with, the, onset, of, drug, resistant, plasmodium, parasites, new, strategies, are, being, developed, to, combat, the, widespread, disease, one, such, approach, lies, in, the, introduction, of, synthetic, pyridoxal, amino, acid, adducts, which, are, taken, up, by, the, parasite, and, ultimately, interfere, with, its, ability, to, create, several, essential, b, vitamins, antimalarial, drugs, using, synthetic, metal, based, complexes, are, attracting, research, interest, on, the, basis, of, molecular, docking, outcomes, compounds, 3j, 4b, 4h, 4m, were, exhibited, selectivity, towards, pfldh, the, post, docking, analysis, displayed, stable, dynamic, behavior, of, all, the, selected, compounds, compared, to, chloroquine, the, end, state, thermodynamics, analysis, stated, 3j, compound, as, a, selective, and, potent, pfldh, inhibitor, targeting, plasmodium, liver, stage, parasites, selectively, is, emerging, as, an, alternative, strategy, in, the, face, of, resistance, to, the, latest, frontline, combination, therapies, against, blood, stages, of, the, parasite, in, research, conducted, in, 2019, using, experimental, analysis, with, knockout, ko, mutants, of, plasmodium, berghei, the, authors, were, able, to, identify, genes, that, are, potentially, essential, in, the, liver, stage, moreover, they, generated, a, computational, model, to, analyse, pre, erytrocytic, development, and, liver, stage, metabolism, combining, both, methods, they, identified, seven, metabolic, subsystems, that, become, essential, compared, to, the, blood, stage, some, of, these, metabolic, pathways, are, fatty, acid, synthesis, and, elongation, tricarboxylic, acid, amino, acid, and, heme, metabolism, among, others, specifically, they, studied, three, subsystems, fatty, acid, synthesis, and, elongation, and, amino, sugar, biosynthesis, for, the, first, two, pathways, they, demonstrated, a, clear, dependence, of, the, liver, stage, on, its, own, fatty, acid, metabolism, they, proved, for, the, first, time, the, critical, role, of, amino, sugar, biosynthesis, in, the, liver, stage, of, p, berghei, the, uptake, of, n, acetyl, glucosamine, appears, to, be, limited, in, the, liver, stage, being, its, synthesis, needed, for, the, parasite, development, these, findings, and, the, computational, model, provide, a, basis, for, the, design, of, antimalarial, therapies, targeting, metabolic, proteins, the, genome, of, plasmodium, falciparum, was, sequenced, and, published, in, the, year, 2002, a, species, of, malaria, plasmodium, tends, to, have, rather, polymorphic, antigens, which, can, serve, as, immune, system, targets, some, searches, of, p, falciparum, genes, for, hotspots, of, encoded, variations, found, sections, of, genes, that, when, tested, proved, to, encode, for, antigens, when, such, antigens, are, use, for, vaccine, targets, a, strain, of, plasmodium, with, a, different, allele, for, the, antigen, can, sometimes, escape, the, immune, response, stimulated, by, the, vaccine, two, related, viruses, marnav, 1, and, marnav, 2, in, plasmodium, vivax, and, in, avian, leucocytozoon, respectively, were, found, through, rna, sequencing, of, blood, the, finding, of, a, virus, infecting, a, human, malaria, plasmodium, is, a, first, discovery, of, its, kind, it, should, lead, to, better, understanding, of, malaria, biology, a, non, chemical, vector, control, strategy, involves, genetic, manipulation, of, malaria, mosquitoes, advances, in, genetic, engineering, technologies, make, it, possible, to, introduce, foreign, dna, into, the, mosquito, genome, and, either, decrease, the, lifespan, of, the, mosquito, or, make, it, more, resistant, to, the, malaria, parasite, sterile, insect, technique, is, a, genetic, control, method, whereby, large, numbers, of, sterile, male, mosquitoes, are, reared, and, released, mating, with, wild, females, reduces, the, wild, population, in, the, subsequent, generation, repeated, releases, eventually, eliminate, the, target, population, genomics, is, central, to, malaria, research, with, the, sequencing, of, p, falciparum, one, of, its, vectors, anopheles, gambiae, and, the, human, genome, the, genetics, of, all, three, organisms, in, the, malaria, life, cycle, can, be, studied, another, new, application, of, genetic, technology, is, the, ability, to, produce, genetically, modified, mosquitoes, that, do, not, transmit, malaria, potentially, allowing, biological, control, of, malaria, transmission, in, one, study, a, genetically, modified, strain, of, anopheles, stephensi, was, created, that, no, longer, supported, malaria, transmission, and, this, resistance, was, passed, down, to, mosquito, offspring, gene, drive, is, a, technique, for, changing, wild, populations, for, instance, to, combat, or, eliminate, insects, so, they, cannot, transmit, diseases, in, particular, mosquitoes, in, the, cases, of, malaria, zika, dengue, and, yellow, fever, in, a, study, conducted, in, 2015, researchers, observed, a, specific, interaction, between, malaria, and, co, infection, with, the, nematode, nippostrongylus, brasiliensis, a, pulmonary, migrating, helminth, in, mice, the, co, infection, was, found, to, reduce, the, virulence, of, the, plasmodium, parasite, the, causative, agent, of, malaria, this, reduction, was, attributed, to, the, nematode, infection, causing, increased, destruction, of, erythrocytes, or, red, blood, cells, given, that, plasmodium, has, a, predilection, for, older, host, erythrocytes, the, increased, erythrocyte, destruction, and, ensuing, erythropoiesis, result, in, a, predominantly, younger, erythrocyte, population, which, in, turn, leads, to, a, decrease, in, plasmodium, population, notably, this, effect, appears, to, be, largely, independent, of, the, host, s, immune, control, of, plasmodium, finally, a, review, article, published, in, december, 2020, noted, a, correlation, between, malaria, endemic, regions, and, covid, 19, case, fatality, rates, the, study, found, that, on, average, regions, where, malaria, is, endemic, reported, lower, covid, 19, case, fatality, rates, compared, to, regions, without, endemic, malaria, in, 2017, a, bacterial, strain, of, the, genus, serratia, was, genetically, modified, to, prevent, malaria, in, mosquitos, and, in, 2023, it, has, been, reported, that, the, bacterium, delftia, tsuruhatensis, naturally, prevents, the, development, of, malaria, by, secreting, a, molecule, called, harmane, other, avenue, that, can, contribute, to, understanding, of, malaria, transmission, is, the, source, of, meal, for, the, vector, when, they, have, the, parasites, its, known, that, plant, sugars, are, the, primary, source, of, nutrients, for, survival, of, adult, mosquitoes, therefore, utilising, this, link, for, management, of, the, vector, will, contribute, in, mitigating, malaria, transmission, while, none, of, the, main, four, species, of, malaria, parasite, that, cause, human, infections, are, known, to, have, animal, reservoirs, p, knowlesi, is, known, to, regularly, infect, both, humans, and, non, human, primates, other, non, human, primate, malarias, particularly, p, cynomolgi, and, p, simium, have, also, been, found, to, have, spilled, over, into, humans, nearly, 200, plasmodium, species, have, been, identified, that, infect, birds, reptiles, and, other, mammals, and, about, 30, of, them, naturally, infect, non, human, primates, some, malaria, parasites, of, non, human, primates, nhp, serve, as, model, organisms, for, human, malarial, parasites, such, as, p, coatneyi, a, model, for, p, falciparum, and, p, cynomolgi, a, model, for, p, vivax, diagnostic, techniques, used, to, detect, parasites, in, nhp, are, similar, to, those, employed, for, humans, malaria, parasites, that, infect, rodents, are, widely, used, as, models, in, research, such, as, p, berghei, avian, malaria, primarily, affects, species, of, the, order, passeriformes, and, poses, a, substantial, threat, to, birds, of, hawaii, the, galapagos, and, other, archipelagoes, the, parasite, p, relictum, is, known, to, play, a, role, in, limiting, the, distribution, and, abundance, of, endemic, hawaiian, birds, global, warming, is, expected, to, increase, the, prevalence, and, global, distribution, of, avian, malaria, as, elevated, temperatures, provide, optimal, conditions, for, parasite, reproduction
