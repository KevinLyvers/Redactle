puberty, is, the, process, of, physical, changes, through, which, a, child, s, body, matures, into, an, adult, body, capable, of, sexual, reproduction, it, is, initiated, by, hormonal, signals, from, the, brain, to, the, gonads, the, ovaries, in, a, female, the, testicles, in, a, male, in, response, to, the, signals, the, gonads, produce, hormones, that, stimulate, libido, and, the, growth, function, and, transformation, of, the, brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and, sex, organs, physical, growth, height, and, weight, accelerates, in, the, first, half, of, puberty, and, is, completed, when, an, adult, body, has, been, developed, before, puberty, the, external, sex, organs, known, as, primary, sexual, characteristics, are, sex, characteristics, that, distinguish, males, and, females, puberty, leads, to, sexual, dimorphism, through, the, development, of, the, secondary, sex, characteristics, which, further, distinguish, the, sexes, on, average, females, begin, puberty, around, age, 10, and, complete, puberty, at, ages, 15, 17, males, generally, begin, puberty, around, ages, 11, 12, and, complete, puberty, at, ages, 16, 17, the, major, landmark, of, puberty, for, females, is, menarche, the, onset, of, menstruation, which, occurs, on, average, around, age, 12, for, males, first, ejaculation, spermarche, occurs, on, average, at, age, 13, in, the, 21st, century, the, average, age, at, which, children, especially, females, reach, specific, markers, of, puberty, is, lower, compared, to, the, 19th, century, when, it, was, 15, for, females, and, 17, for, males, with, age, at, first, periods, for, females, and, voice, breaks, for, males, being, used, as, examples, this, can, be, due, to, any, number, of, factors, including, improved, nutrition, resulting, in, rapid, body, growth, increased, weight, and, fat, deposition, or, exposure, to, endocrine, disruptors, such, as, xenoestrogens, which, can, at, times, be, due, to, food, consumption, or, other, environmental, factors, however, more, modern, archeological, research, suggests, that, the, rate, of, puberty, as, it, occurs, now, is, the, intended, way, growth, spurts, began, at, around, 10, 12, but, markers, of, later, stages, of, puberty, such, as, menarche, had, delays, that, correlated, with, severe, environmental, conditions, such, as, poverty, poor, nutrition, air, and, pollution, puberty, that, starts, earlier, than, usual, is, known, as, precocious, puberty, and, puberty, which, starts, later, than, usual, is, known, as, delayed, puberty, notable, among, the, morphologic, changes, in, size, shape, composition, and, functioning, of, the, pubertal, body, is, the, development, of, secondary, sex, characteristics, the, filling, in, of, the, child, s, body, from, girl, to, woman, from, boy, to, man, derived, from, the, latin, puberatum, age, of, maturity, the, word, puberty, describes, the, physical, changes, to, sexual, maturation, not, the, psychosocial, and, cultural, maturation, denoted, by, the, term, adolescent, development, in, western, culture, wherein, adolescence, is, the, period, of, mental, transition, from, childhood, to, adulthood, which, overlaps, much, of, the, body, s, period, of, puberty, two, of, the, most, significant, differences, between, puberty, in, females, and, puberty, in, males, are, the, age, at, which, it, begins, and, the, major, sex, steroids, involved, the, androgens, and, the, estrogens, although, there, is, a, wide, range, of, normal, ages, females, typically, begin, puberty, around, age, 10, and, end, puberty, around, 15, 17, males, begin, around, ages, 11, 12, and, end, around, 16, 17, females, attain, reproductive, maturity, about, four, years, after, the, first, physical, changes, of, puberty, appear, in, contrast, males, accelerate, more, slowly, but, continue, to, grow, for, about, six, years, after, the, first, visible, pubertal, changes, any, increase, in, height, beyond, the, post, pubertal, age, is, uncommon, for, males, the, androgen, testosterone, is, the, principal, sex, hormone, while, testosterone, is, produced, all, males, changes, are, characterized, as, virilization, a, substantial, product, of, testosterone, metabolism, in, males, is, the, estrogen, estradiol, the, conversion, of, testosterone, to, estradiol, depends, on, the, amount, of, body, fat, and, estradiol, levels, in, males, are, typically, much, lower, than, in, females, the, male, growth, spurt, also, begins, later, accelerates, more, slowly, and, lasts, longer, before, the, epiphyses, fuse, although, males, are, on, average, 2, centimetres, 0, 8, in, shorter, than, females, before, puberty, begins, adult, men, are, on, average, about, 13, centimetres, 5, 1, in, taller, than, women, most, of, this, sex, difference, in, adult, heights, is, attributable, to, a, later, onset, of, the, growth, spurt, and, a, slower, progression, to, completion, a, direct, result, of, the, later, rise, and, lower, adult, male, levels, of, estradiol, the, hormonal, maturation, of, females, is, considerably, more, complicated, than, in, males, the, main, steroid, hormones, testosterone, estradiol, and, progesterone, as, well, as, prolactin, play, important, physiological, functions, in, puberty, the, production, of, gonadal, steroids, in, females, starts, with, production, of, testosterone, which, is, typically, quickly, converted, to, estradiol, inside, the, ovaries, however, the, rate, of, conversion, from, testosterone, to, estradiol, driven, by, fsh, lh, balance, during, early, puberty, is, highly, individual, resulting, in, very, diverse, development, patterns, of, secondary, sexual, characteristics, production, of, progesterone, in, the, ovaries, begins, with, the, development, of, ovulatory, cycles, in, females, during, the, lutheal, phase, of, the, cycle, before, puberty, low, levels, of, progesterone, are, produced, in, the, adrenal, glands, of, both, males, and, females, estradiol, levels, rise, earlier, and, reach, higher, levels, in, women, than, in, men, while, estradiol, promotes, growth, of, the, breasts, and, uterus, it, is, also, the, principal, hormone, driving, the, pubertal, growth, spurt, and, epiphyseal, maturation, and, closure, puberty, is, preceded, by, adrenarche, marking, an, increase, of, adrenal, androgen, production, between, ages, 6, 10, adrenarche, is, sometimes, accompanied, by, the, early, appearance, of, axillary, and, pubic, hair, the, first, androgenic, hair, resulting, from, adrenarche, can, be, also, transient, and, disappear, before, the, onset, of, true, puberty, the, onset, of, puberty, is, associated, with, high, gnrh, pulsing, which, precedes, the, rise, in, sex, hormones, lh, and, fsh, exogenous, gnrh, pulses, cause, the, onset, of, puberty, brain, tumors, which, increase, gnrh, output, may, also, lead, to, premature, puberty, the, cause, of, the, gnrh, rise, is, unknown, leptin, might, be, the, cause, of, the, gnrh, rise, leptin, has, receptors, in, the, hypothalamus, which, synthesizes, gnrh, individuals, who, are, deficient, in, leptin, fail, to, initiate, puberty, the, levels, of, leptin, increase, with, the, onset, of, puberty, and, then, decline, to, adult, levels, when, puberty, is, completed, the, rise, in, gnrh, might, also, be, caused, by, genetics, a, study, discovered, that, a, mutation, in, genes, encoding, both, neurokinin, b, as, well, as, the, neurokinin, b, receptor, can, alter, the, timing, of, puberty, the, researchers, hypothesized, that, neurokinin, b, might, play, a, role, in, regulating, the, secretion, of, kisspeptin, a, compound, responsible, for, triggering, direct, release, of, gnrh, as, well, as, indirect, release, of, lh, and, fsh, several, studies, about, puberty, have, examined, the, effects, of, an, early, or, a, late, onset, of, puberty, in, males, and, females, in, general, females, who, enter, puberty, late, experience, positive, outcomes, in, adolescence, and, adulthood, while, females, who, enter, puberty, early, experience, negative, outcomes, males, who, have, earlier, pubertal, timing, generally, have, more, positive, outcomes, in, adulthood, but, more, negative, outcomes, in, adolescence, while, the, reverse, is, true, for, later, pubertal, timing, outcomes, have, generally, indicated, that, early, onset, of, puberty, in, females, can, be, psychologically, damaging, the, main, reason, for, this, detrimental, effect, is, the, issue, of, body, image, as, they, physically, develop, gaining, weight, in, several, areas, of, the, body, early, maturing, females, usually, look, larger, than, females, who, have, not, yet, entered, puberty, a, result, of, the, social, pressure, to, be, thin, the, early, maturing, females, develop, a, negative, view, of, their, body, image, in, addition, people, may, tease, the, females, about, their, visible, breasts, forcing, the, early, maturing, female, to, hide, her, breasts, by, dressing, differently, embarrassment, about, a, more, developed, body, may, also, result, in, the, refusal, to, undress, for, gym, these, experiences, lead, to, lower, self, esteem, more, depression, and, poorer, body, image, in, these, early, maturing, females, furthermore, as, physical, and, emotional, differences, set, them, apart, from, people, in, their, same, age, group, early, maturing, females, develop, relationships, with, older, people, for, instance, some, early, maturing, females, have, older, malefriends, attracted, to, the, females, womanly, physique, and, femaleish, innocence, while, having, an, older, malefriend, might, improve, popularity, among, peers, it, also, increases, the, risk, of, alcohol, and, drug, use, increased, sexual, relations, often, unprotected, eating, disorders, and, bullying, generally, later, onset, of, puberty, in, females, produces, positive, outcomes, they, exhibit, positive, behaviors, in, adolescence, that, continue, to, adulthood, in, the, past, early, onset, of, puberty, in, males, has, been, associated, with, positive, outcomes, such, as, leadership, in, high, school, and, success, in, adulthood, however, recent, studies, have, revealed, that, the, risks, and, problems, of, early, maturation, in, males, might, outweigh, the, benefits, early, maturing, males, develop, more, aggressive, law, breaking, and, alcohol, abusing, behaviors, which, result, in, anger, towards, parents, and, trouble, in, school, and, with, the, police, early, puberty, also, correlates, with, increased, sexual, activity, and, a, higher, instance, of, teenage, pregnancy, both, of, which, can, lead, to, depression, and, other, psychosocial, issues, however, early, puberty, might, also, result, in, positive, outcomes, such, as, popularity, among, peers, higher, self, esteem, and, confidence, as, a, result, of, physical, developments, such, as, taller, height, developed, muscles, muscular, male, breast, and, better, athletic, ability, on, the, other, hand, late, maturing, males, develop, lower, self, esteem, and, confidence, and, generally, have, lower, popularity, among, peers, due, to, their, less, developed, physiques, also, they, experience, problems, with, anxiety, and, depression, and, are, more, likely, to, be, afraid, of, sex, than, other, males, in, males, puberty, begins, with, the, enlargement, of, the, testicles, and, scrotum, the, penis, also, increases, in, size, and, a, male, develops, pubic, hair, a, male, s, testicles, also, begin, making, sperm, the, release, of, semen, which, contains, sperm, and, other, fluids, is, called, ejaculation, during, puberty, a, male, s, erect, penis, becomes, capable, of, ejaculating, semen, and, impregnating, a, female, a, male, s, first, ejaculation, is, an, important, milestone, in, his, development, on, average, a, male, s, first, ejaculation, occurs, at, age, 13, ejaculation, sometimes, occurs, during, sleep, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, a, nocturnal, emission, in, males, testicular, enlargement, is, the, first, physical, manifestation, of, puberty, and, is, termed, gonadarche, testes, in, prepubertal, males, change, little, in, size, from, about, 1, year, of, age, to, the, onset, of, puberty, averaging, about, 2, 3, cm, in, length, and, about, 1, 5, 2, cm, in, width, the, size, of, the, testicles, is, among, the, parameters, of, the, tanner, scale, for, male, genitals, from, stage, i, which, represents, a, volume, of, less, than, 1, 5, ml, to, stage, v, which, represents, a, testicular, volume, of, greater, than, or, equal, to, 20, ml, testicular, size, reaches, maximal, adult, size, about, 6, years, after, the, onset, of, puberty, while, 18, 20, cm, 3, is, an, average, adult, size, there, is, wide, variation, in, testicular, size, in, the, normal, population, after, the, male, s, testicles, have, enlarged, and, developed, for, about, one, year, the, length, and, then, the, breadth, of, the, shaft, of, the, penis, will, increase, and, the, glans, penis, and, corpora, cavernosa, will, also, start, to, enlarge, to, adult, proportions, by, the, end, of, puberty, adult, men, have, heavier, bones, and, nearly, twice, as, much, skeletal, muscle, some, of, the, bone, growth, e, g, shoulder, width, and, jaw, is, disproportionately, greater, resulting, in, noticeably, different, male, and, female, skeletal, shapes, the, average, adult, male, has, about, 150, of, the, lean, body, mass, of, an, average, female, and, about, 50, of, the, body, fat, this, muscle, develops, mainly, during, the, later, stages, of, puberty, and, muscle, growth, can, continue, even, after, males, are, biologically, adult, the, peak, of, the, so, called, strength, spurt, the, rate, of, muscle, growth, is, attained, about, one, year, after, a, male, experiences, his, peak, growth, rate, often, the, fat, pads, of, the, male, breast, tissue, and, the, male, nipples, will, develop, during, puberty, sometimes, especially, in, one, breast, this, becomes, more, apparent, and, is, termed, gynecomastia, it, is, usually, not, a, permanent, phenomenon, erections, during, sleep, or, when, waking, up, are, medically, known, as, nocturnal, penile, tumescence, and, colloquially, referred, to, as, morning, wood, the, penis, can, regularly, get, erect, during, sleep, and, men, or, males, often, wake, up, with, an, erection, once, a, male, reaches, his, teenage, years, erections, occur, much, more, frequently, due, to, puberty, erections, can, occur, spontaneously, at, any, time, of, day, and, if, clothed, may, cause, a, bulge, or, hump, this, can, be, disguised, or, hidden, by, wearing, close, fitting, underwear, a, long, shirt, and, baggier, clothes, erections, are, common, for, male, prepubescent, children, and, infants, and, can, even, occur, before, birth, spontaneous, erections, are, also, known, as, involuntary, or, unwanted, erections, and, are, normal, such, erections, can, be, embarrassing, if, they, happen, in, public, such, as, a, classroom, or, living, room, during, puberty, if, not, before, the, tip, and, opening, of, a, male, s, foreskin, becomes, wider, progressively, allowing, for, retraction, down, the, shaft, of, the, penis, and, behind, the, glans, which, ultimately, should, be, possible, without, pain, or, difficulty, the, membrane, that, bonds, the, inner, surface, of, the, foreskin, with, the, glans, disintegrates, and, releases, the, foreskin, to, separate, from, the, glans, the, foreskin, then, gradually, becomes, retractable, research, by, ster, 1968, found, that, with, the, onset, and, continuation, of, puberty, the, proportion, of, males, able, to, pull, back, their, foreskins, increased, at, ages, 12, 13, ster, found, that, only, 60, of, males, were, able, to, retract, their, foreskins, this, increased, to, 85, by, ages, 14, 15, and, 95, by, 16, 17, he, also, found, that, 1, of, those, unable, to, fully, retract, experienced, phimosis, at, ages, 14, 17, the, remainder, were, partially, able, to, the, findings, were, supported, by, further, research, by, kayaba, et, al, 1996, on, a, sample, of, over, 600, males, and, ishikawa, and, kawakita, 2004, found, that, by, age, 15, 77, of, their, sample, of, males, could, retract, their, foreskins, beaug, 1997, reports, that, males, may, assist, the, development, of, retractile, foreskin, by, manual, stretching, once, a, male, is, able, to, retract, his, foreskin, penile, hygiene, should, become, an, important, feature, of, his, routine, body, care, although, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, states, there, is, little, evidence, to, affirm, the, association, between, circumcision, status, and, optimal, penile, hygiene, various, studies, suggest, that, males, be, educated, about, the, role, of, hygiene, including, retracting, the, foreskin, while, urinating, and, rinsing, under, it, and, around, the, glans, at, each, bathing, opportunity, regular, washing, under, the, foreskin, was, found, by, krueger, and, osborn, 1986, to, reduce, the, risk, of, numerous, penile, disorders, however, birley, et, al, 1993, report, excessive, washing, with, soap, should, be, avoided, because, it, dries, the, oils, out, of, the, tissues, and, can, cause, non, specific, dermatitis, pubic, hair, often, appears, on, a, male, shortly, after, the, genitalia, begin, to, grow, the, pubic, hairs, are, usually, first, visible, at, the, dorsal, abdominal, base, of, the, penis, the, first, few, hairs, are, described, as, stage, 2, stage, 3, is, usually, reached, within, another, 6, 12, months, when, the, hairs, are, too, many, to, count, by, stage, 4, the, pubic, hairs, densely, fill, the, pubic, triangle, stage, 5, refers, to, the, spread, of, pubic, hair, to, the, thighs, and, upward, towards, the, navel, as, part, of, the, developing, abdominal, hair, in, the, months, and, years, following, the, appearance, of, pubic, hair, other, areas, of, skin, that, respond, to, androgens, may, develop, androgenic, hair, the, usual, sequence, is, underarm, axillary, hair, perianal, hair, upper, lip, hair, sideburn, preauricular, hair, periareolar, hair, and, the, beard, area, as, with, most, human, biological, processes, this, specific, order, may, vary, among, some, individuals, arm, leg, chest, abdominal, and, back, hair, become, heavier, more, gradually, there, is, a, large, range, in, amount, of, body, hair, among, adult, men, and, significant, differences, in, timing, and, quantity, of, hair, growth, among, different, racial, groups, facial, hair, is, often, present, in, late, adolescence, but, may, not, appear, until, significantly, later, facial, hair, will, continue, to, get, coarser, darker, and, thicker, for, another, 2, 4, years, after, puberty, some, men, do, not, develop, full, facial, hair, for, up, to, 10, years, after, the, completion, of, puberty, chest, hair, may, appear, during, puberty, or, years, after, though, not, all, men, develop, it, under, the, influence, of, androgens, the, larynx, or, voice, box, grows, in, both, sexes, this, growth, is, far, more, prominent, in, males, causing, the, male, voice, to, drop, and, deepen, sometimes, abruptly, but, rarely, overnight, about, one, octave, because, the, longer, and, thicker, vocal, folds, have, a, lower, fundamental, frequency, before, puberty, the, larynx, of, males, and, females, is, about, equally, small, occasionally, voice, change, is, accompanied, by, unsteadiness, of, vocalization, in, the, early, stages, of, untrained, voices, most, of, the, voice, change, happens, during, stage, 3, 4, of, male, puberty, around, the, time, of, peak, growth, adult, pitch, is, attained, at, an, average, age, of, 15, years, although, the, voice, may, not, fully, settle, until, early, twenties, it, usually, precedes, the, development, of, significant, facial, hair, by, several, months, to, years, the, first, physical, sign, of, puberty, in, females, is, usually, a, firm, tender, lump, under, the, center, of, the, areola, of, one, or, both, breasts, occurring, on, average, at, about, 10, years, of, age, this, is, referred, to, as, thelarche, by, the, widely, used, tanner, staging, of, puberty, this, is, stage, 2, of, breast, development, stage, 1, is, a, flat, prepubertal, breast, within, 6, 12, months, the, swelling, has, clearly, begun, in, both, sides, softened, and, can, be, felt, and, seen, extending, beyond, the, edges, of, the, areolae, this, is, stage, 3, of, breast, development, by, another, 12, months, stage, 4, the, breasts, are, approaching, mature, size, and, shape, with, areolae, and, nipples, forming, a, secondary, mound, in, most, young, women, this, mound, disappears, into, the, contour, of, the, mature, breast, stage, 5, although, there, is, so, much, variation, in, sizes, and, shapes, of, adult, breasts, that, stages, 4, and, 5, are, not, always, separately, identifiable, pubic, hair, is, often, the, second, noticeable, change, in, puberty, usually, within, a, few, months, of, thelarche, it, is, referred, to, as, pubarche, the, pubic, hairs, are, usually, visible, first, along, the, labia, the, first, few, hairs, are, described, as, tanner, stage, 2, stage, 3, is, usually, reached, within, another, 6, 12, months, when, the, hairs, are, too, numerous, to, count, and, appear, on, the, pubic, mound, as, well, by, stage, 4, the, pubic, hairs, densely, fill, the, pubic, triangle, stage, 5, refers, to, spread, of, pubic, hair, to, the, thighs, and, sometimes, as, abdominal, hair, upward, towards, the, navel, in, about, 15, of, females, the, earliest, pubic, hair, appears, before, breast, development, begins, perineal, skin, keratinizes, due, to, effect, of, estrogen, increasing, its, resistance, to, infection, the, mucosal, surface, of, the, vagina, also, changes, in, response, to, increasing, levels, of, estrogen, becoming, thicker, and, duller, pink, in, color, in, contrast, to, the, brighter, red, of, the, prepubertal, vaginal, mucosa, mucosa, changes, into, a, multilayered, structure, with, superficial, layer, of, squamous, cells, estrogen, increase, glycogen, content, in, vaginal, epithelium, which, in, future, plays, important, part, in, maintaining, vaginal, ph, whitish, secretions, physiologic, leukorrhea, are, a, normal, effect, of, estrogen, as, well, in, the, two, years, following, thelarche, the, uterus, ovaries, and, the, follicles, in, the, ovaries, increase, in, size, the, ovaries, usually, contain, small, follicular, cysts, visible, by, ultrasound, before, puberty, uterine, body, to, cervix, ratio, is, 1, 1, which, increases, to, 2, 1, or, 3, 1, after, completion, of, pubertal, period, the, first, menstrual, bleeding, is, referred, to, as, menarche, and, typically, occurs, about, two, years, after, thelarche, the, average, age, of, menarche, is, 12, in, the, united, states, most, american, females, experience, their, first, period, at, 11, 12, or, 13, but, some, experience, it, earlier, than, their, 11th, birthday, and, others, after, their, 14th, birthday, in, fact, anytime, between, 8, and, 16, is, normal, in, canada, the, average, age, of, menarche, is, 12, 72, and, in, the, united, kingdom, it, is, 12, 9, the, time, between, menstrual, periods, menses, is, not, always, regular, in, the, first, two, years, after, menarche, ovulation, is, necessary, for, fertility, but, may, or, may, not, accompany, the, earliest, menses, in, postmenarchal, females, about, 80, of, the, cycles, were, anovulatory, in, the, first, year, after, menarche, 50, in, the, third, year, and, 10, in, the, sixth, year, initiation, of, ovulation, after, menarche, is, not, inevitable, a, high, proportion, of, females, with, continued, irregularity, in, the, menstrual, cycle, several, years, from, menarche, will, continue, to, have, prolonged, irregularity, and, anovulation, and, are, at, higher, risk, for, reduced, fertility, during, this, period, also, in, response, to, rising, levels, of, estrogen, the, lower, half, of, the, pelvis, and, thus, hips, widen, providing, a, larger, birth, canal, fat, tissue, increases, to, a, greater, percentage, of, the, body, composition, than, in, males, especially, in, the, typical, female, distribution, of, breasts, hips, buttocks, thighs, upper, arms, and, pubis, progressive, differences, in, fat, distribution, as, well, as, sex, differences, in, local, skeletal, growth, contribute, to, the, typical, female, body, shape, by, the, end, of, puberty, on, average, at, 10, years, females, have, 6, more, body, fat, than, males, rising, levels, of, androgens, can, change, the, fatty, acid, composition, of, perspiration, resulting, in, a, more, adult, body, odor, this, often, precedes, thelarche, and, pubarche, by, one, or, more, years, another, androgen, effect, is, increased, secretion, of, oil, sebum, from, the, skin, this, change, increases, the, susceptibility, to, acne, a, skin, condition, that, is, characteristic, of, puberty, acne, varies, greatly, in, its, severity, in, females, estradiol, the, primary, female, sex, hormone, causes, thickening, of, lips, and, oral, mucosa, as, well, as, further, development, of, the, vulva, in, the, vulva, and, vagina, estradiol, causes, thickening, stratification, of, the, skin, and, the, growth, of, both, the, myoepithelial, layer, and, the, smooth, muscle, of, the, vagina, typically, estradiol, will, also, cause, pronounced, growth, of, the, labia, minora, and, to, a, lesser, degree, of, the, labia, majora, estradiol, is, also, responsible, for, the, increased, production, of, pheomelanin, resulting, in, the, characteristic, red, color, of, the, lips, labia, minora, and, sometimes, labia, majora, estradiol, together, with, other, ovarian, steroids, also, cause, the, darker, coloration, of, the, areola, testosterone, will, cause, an, enlargement, of, the, clitoris, and, possibly, has, important, effects, on, the, growth, and, maturation, of, the, vestibular, bulbs, corpora, cavernosa, of, the, clitoris, and, urethral, sponge, changes, of, the, vulva, initiated, by, estradiol, as, well, as, its, direct, effects, also, appear, to, influence, the, functioning, of, the, lower, urinary, tract, hair, growth, develops, under, the, arms, starting, out, sparse, before, thickening, and, darkening, over, time, in, a, general, sense, the, conclusion, of, puberty, is, reproductive, maturity, criteria, for, defining, the, conclusion, may, differ, for, different, purposes, attainment, of, the, ability, to, reproduce, achievement, of, maximal, adult, height, maximal, gonadal, size, or, adult, sex, hormone, levels, maximal, adult, height, is, achieved, at, an, average, age, of, 15, years, for, an, average, female, and, 18, years, for, an, average, male, potential, fertility, sometimes, termed, nubility, usually, precedes, completion, of, growth, by, 1, 2, years, in, females, and, 3, 4, years, in, males, stage, 5, typically, represents, maximal, gonadal, growth, and, adult, hormone, levels, the, definition, of, the, onset, of, puberty, may, depend, on, perspective, e, g, hormonal, versus, physical, and, purpose, establishing, population, normal, standards, clinical, care, of, early, or, late, pubescent, individuals, etc, a, common, definition, for, the, onset, of, puberty, is, physical, changes, to, a, person, s, body, these, physical, changes, are, the, first, visible, signs, of, neural, hormonal, and, gonadal, function, changes, the, age, at, which, puberty, begins, varies, between, individuals, usually, puberty, begins, between, 10, and, 13, years, of, age, the, age, at, which, puberty, begins, is, affected, by, both, genetic, factors, and, by, environmental, factors, such, as, nutritional, state, and, social, circumstances, an, example, of, social, circumstances, is, the, vandenbergh, effect, a, juvenile, female, who, has, significant, interaction, with, adult, males, will, enter, puberty, earlier, than, juvenile, females, who, are, not, socially, overexposed, to, adult, males, the, average, age, at, which, puberty, begins, may, be, affected, by, ethnicity, as, well, for, example, the, average, age, of, menarche, in, various, populations, surveyed, has, ranged, from, 12, to, 18, years, the, earliest, average, onset, of, puberty, is, for, african, american, females, and, the, latest, average, onset, for, high, altitude, subsistence, populations, in, asia, however, much, of, the, higher, age, averages, reflect, nutritional, limitations, more, than, genetic, differences, and, can, change, within, a, few, generations, with, a, substantial, change, in, diet, the, median, age, of, menarche, for, a, population, may, be, an, index, of, the, proportion, of, undernourished, females, in, the, population, and, the, width, of, the, spread, may, reflect, unevenness, of, wealth, and, food, distribution, in, a, population, researchers, have, identified, an, earlier, age, of, the, onset, of, puberty, however, they, have, based, their, conclusions, on, a, comparison, of, data, from, 1999, with, data, from, 1969, in, the, earlier, example, the, sample, population, was, based, on, a, small, sample, of, white, females, 200, from, britain, the, later, study, identified, as, puberty, as, occurring, in, 48, of, african, american, females, by, age, nine, and, 12, of, white, females, by, that, age, one, possible, cause, of, a, delay, in, the, onset, of, puberty, past, the, age, 14, in, females, and, 15, in, males, is, kallmann, syndrome, a, form, of, hypogonadotropic, hypogonadism, hh, kallmann, syndrome, is, also, associated, with, a, lack, of, sense, of, smell, anosmia, kallmann, syndrome, and, other, forms, of, hh, affect, both, men, and, women, it, is, caused, by, a, failure, in, hpg, axis, at, puberty, which, results, in, low, or, zero, gonadotropin, lh, and, fsh, levels, with, the, subsequent, result, of, a, failure, to, commence, or, complete, puberty, secondary, hypogonadism, and, infertility, the, average, age, at, which, the, onset, of, puberty, occurs, has, dropped, significantly, since, the, 1840s, in, every, decade, from, 1840, to, 1950, there, was, a, drop, of, four, months, in, the, average, age, of, menarche, among, western, european, females, in, norway, females, born, in, 1840, had, their, menarche, at, an, average, age, of, 17, years, in, france, the, average, in, 1840, was, 15, 3, years, in, england, the, average, in, 1840, was, 16, years, in, japan, the, decline, happened, later, and, was, then, more, rapid, from, 1945, to, 1975, in, japan, there, was, a, drop, of, 11, months, per, decade, a, 2006, study, in, denmark, found, that, puberty, as, evidenced, by, breast, development, started, at, an, average, age, of, 9, years, and, 10, months, a, year, earlier, than, when, a, similar, study, was, done, in, 1991, scientists, believe, the, phenomenon, could, be, linked, to, obesity, or, exposure, to, chemicals, in, the, food, chain, and, is, putting, females, at, greater, long, term, risk, of, breast, cancer, various, studies, have, found, direct, genetic, effects, to, account, for, at, least, 46, of, the, variation, of, timing, of, puberty, in, well, nourished, populations, the, genetic, association, of, timing, is, strongest, between, mothers, and, daughters, the, specific, genes, affecting, timing, are, not, yet, known, among, the, candidates, is, an, androgen, receptor, gene, researchers, have, hypothesized, that, early, puberty, onset, may, be, caused, by, certain, hair, care, products, containing, estrogen, or, placenta, and, by, certain, chemicals, namely, phthalates, which, are, used, in, many, cosmetics, toys, and, plastic, food, containers, if, genetic, factors, account, for, half, of, the, variation, of, pubertal, timing, environment, factors, are, clearly, important, as, well, one, of, the, first, observed, environmental, effects, is, that, puberty, occurs, later, in, children, raised, at, higher, altitudes, the, most, important, of, the, environmental, influences, is, clearly, nutrition, but, a, number, of, others, have, been, identified, all, which, affect, timing, of, female, puberty, and, menarche, more, clearly, than, male, puberty, there, is, theoretical, concern, and, animal, evidence, that, environmental, hormones, and, chemicals, may, affect, aspects, of, prenatal, or, postnatal, sexual, development, in, humans, large, amounts, of, incompletely, metabolized, estrogens, and, progestogens, from, pharmaceutical, products, are, excreted, into, the, sewage, systems, of, large, cities, and, are, sometimes, detectable, in, the, environment, sex, steroids, are, sometimes, used, in, cattle, farming, but, have, been, banned, in, chicken, meat, production, for, 40, years, although, agricultural, laws, regulate, use, to, minimize, accidental, human, consumption, the, rules, are, largely, self, enforced, in, the, united, states, significant, exposure, of, a, child, to, hormones, or, other, substances, that, activate, estrogen, or, androgen, receptors, could, produce, some, or, all, of, the, changes, of, puberty, harder, to, detect, as, an, influence, on, puberty, are, the, more, diffusely, distributed, environmental, chemicals, like, pcbs, polychlorinated, biphenyl, which, can, bind, and, trigger, estrogen, receptors, more, obvious, degrees, of, partial, puberty, from, direct, exposure, of, young, children, to, small, but, significant, amounts, of, pharmaceutical, sex, steroids, from, exposure, at, home, may, be, detected, during, medical, evaluation, for, precocious, puberty, but, mild, effects, and, the, other, potential, exposures, outlined, above, would, not, bisphenol, a, bpa, is, a, chemical, used, to, make, plastics, and, is, frequently, used, to, make, baby, bottles, water, bottles, sports, equipment, medical, devices, and, as, a, coating, in, food, and, beverage, cans, scientists, are, concerned, about, bpa, s, behavioral, effects, on, fetuses, infants, and, children, at, current, exposure, levels, because, it, can, affect, the, prostate, gland, mammary, gland, and, lead, to, early, puberty, in, females, bpa, mimics, and, interferes, with, the, action, of, estrogen, an, important, reproduction, and, development, regulator, it, leaches, out, of, plastic, into, liquids, and, foods, and, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, found, measurable, amounts, of, bpa, in, the, bodies, of, more, than, 90, percent, of, the, u, s, population, studied, the, highest, estimated, daily, intakes, of, bpa, occur, in, infants, and, children, many, plastic, baby, bottles, contain, bpa, and, bpa, is, more, likely, to, leach, out, of, plastic, when, its, temperature, is, increased, as, when, one, warms, a, baby, bottle, or, warms, up, food, in, the, microwave, nutritional, factors, are, the, strongest, and, most, obvious, environmental, factors, affecting, timing, of, puberty, females, are, especially, sensitive, to, nutritional, regulation, because, they, must, contribute, all, of, the, nutritional, support, to, a, growing, fetus, surplus, calories, beyond, growth, and, activity, requirements, are, reflected, in, the, amount, of, body, fat, which, signals, to, the, brain, the, availability, of, resources, for, initiation, of, puberty, and, fertility, much, evidence, suggests, that, for, most, of, the, last, few, centuries, nutritional, differences, accounted, for, majority, of, variation, of, pubertal, timing, in, different, populations, and, even, among, social, classes, in, the, same, population, recent, worldwide, increased, consumption, of, animal, protein, other, changes, in, nutrition, and, increases, in, childhood, obesity, have, resulted, in, falling, ages, of, puberty, mainly, in, those, populations, with, the, higher, previous, ages, in, many, populations, the, amount, of, variation, attributable, to, nutrition, is, shrinking, although, available, dietary, energy, simple, calories, is, the, most, important, dietary, influence, on, timing, of, puberty, quality, of, the, diet, plays, a, role, as, well, lower, protein, intakes, and, higher, dietary, fiber, intakes, as, occur, with, typical, vegetarian, diets, are, associated, with, later, onset, and, slower, progression, of, female, puberty, scientific, researchers, have, linked, early, obesity, with, an, earlier, onset, of, puberty, in, females, they, have, cited, obesity, as, a, cause, of, breast, development, before, nine, years, and, menarche, before, twelve, years, early, puberty, in, females, can, be, a, harbinger, of, later, health, problems, the, average, level, of, daily, physical, activity, has, also, been, shown, to, affect, timing, of, puberty, especially, in, females, a, high, level, of, exercise, whether, for, athletic, or, body, image, purposes, or, for, daily, subsistence, reduces, energy, calories, available, for, reproduction, and, slows, puberty, the, exercise, effect, is, often, amplified, by, a, lower, body, fat, mass, and, cholesterol, chronic, diseases, can, delay, puberty, in, both, males, and, females, those, that, involve, chronic, inflammation, or, interfere, with, nutrition, have, the, strongest, effect, in, the, western, world, inflammatory, bowel, disease, and, tuberculosis, have, been, notorious, for, such, an, effect, in, the, last, century, while, in, areas, of, the, underdeveloped, world, chronic, parasite, infections, are, widespread, mental, illnesses, occur, in, puberty, the, brain, undergoes, significant, development, by, hormones, which, can, contribute, to, mood, disorders, such, as, major, depressive, disorder, bipolar, disorder, dysthymia, and, schizophrenia, females, aged, between, 15, and, 19, make, up, 40, of, anorexia, nervosa, cases, some, of, the, least, understood, environmental, influences, on, timing, of, puberty, are, social, and, psychological, in, comparison, with, the, effects, of, genetics, nutrition, and, general, health, social, influences, are, small, shifting, timing, by, a, few, months, rather, than, years, mechanisms, of, these, social, effects, are, unknown, though, a, variety, of, physiological, processes, including, pheromones, have, been, suggested, based, on, animal, research, the, most, important, part, of, a, child, s, psychosocial, environment, is, the, family, and, most, of, the, social, influence, research, has, investigated, features, of, family, structure, and, function, in, relation, to, earlier, or, later, female, puberty, most, of, the, studies, have, reported, that, menarche, may, occur, a, few, months, earlier, in, females, in, high, stress, households, whose, fathers, are, absent, during, their, early, childhood, who, have, a, stepfather, in, the, home, who, are, subjected, to, prolonged, sexual, abuse, in, childhood, or, who, are, adopted, from, a, developing, country, at, a, young, age, conversely, menarche, may, be, slightly, later, when, a, female, grows, up, in, a, large, family, with, a, biological, father, present, more, extreme, degrees, of, environmental, stress, such, as, wartime, refugee, status, with, threat, to, physical, survival, have, been, found, to, be, associated, with, delay, of, maturation, an, effect, that, may, be, compounded, by, dietary, inadequacy, most, of, these, reported, social, effects, are, small, and, our, understanding, is, incomplete, most, of, these, effects, are, statistical, associations, revealed, by, epidemiologic, surveys, statistical, associations, are, not, necessarily, causal, and, a, variety, of, covariables, and, alternative, explanations, can, be, imagined, effects, of, such, small, size, can, never, be, confirmed, or, refuted, for, any, individual, child, furthermore, interpretations, of, the, data, are, politically, controversial, because, of, the, ease, with, which, this, type, of, research, can, be, used, for, political, advocacy, accusations, of, bias, based, on, political, agenda, sometimes, accompany, scientific, criticism, another, limitation, of, the, social, research, is, that, nearly, all, of, it, has, concerned, females, partly, because, female, puberty, requires, greater, physiologic, resources, and, partly, because, it, involves, a, unique, event, menarche, that, makes, survey, research, into, female, puberty, much, simpler, than, male, more, detail, is, provided, in, the, menarche, article, the, sequence, of, events, of, pubertal, development, can, occasionally, vary, for, example, in, about, 15, of, males, and, females, pubarche, the, first, pubic, hairs, can, precede, respectively, gonadarche, and, thelarche, by, a, few, months, rarely, menarche, can, occur, before, other, signs, of, puberty, in, a, few, females, these, variations, deserve, medical, evaluation, because, they, can, occasionally, signal, a, disease, the, endocrine, reproductive, system, consists, of, the, hypothalamus, the, pituitary, the, gonads, and, the, adrenal, glands, with, input, and, regulation, from, many, other, body, systems, true, puberty, is, often, termed, central, puberty, because, it, begins, as, a, process, of, the, central, nervous, system, a, simple, description, of, hormonal, puberty, is, as, follows, the, onset, of, this, neurohormonal, process, may, precede, the, first, visible, body, changes, by, 1, 2, years, the, arcuate, nucleus, of, the, hypothalamus, is, the, driver, of, the, reproductive, system, it, has, neurons, which, generate, and, release, pulses, of, gnrh, into, the, portal, venous, system, of, the, pituitary, gland, the, arcuate, nucleus, is, affected, and, controlled, by, neuronal, input, from, other, areas, of, the, brain, and, hormonal, input, from, the, gonads, adipose, tissue, and, a, variety, of, other, systems, the, pituitary, gland, responds, to, the, pulsed, gnrh, signals, by, releasing, lh, and, fsh, into, the, blood, of, the, general, circulation, also, in, a, pulsatile, pattern, the, gonads, testes, and, ovaries, respond, to, rising, levels, of, lh, and, fsh, by, producing, the, steroid, sex, hormones, testosterone, and, estrogen, the, adrenal, glands, are, a, second, source, for, steroid, hormones, adrenal, maturation, termed, adrenarche, typically, precedes, gonadarche, in, mid, childhood, the, endocrine, reproductive, system, becomes, functional, by, the, end, of, the, first, trimester, of, fetal, life, the, testes, and, ovaries, become, briefly, inactive, around, the, time, of, birth, but, resume, hormonal, activity, until, several, months, after, birth, when, incompletely, understood, mechanisms, in, the, brain, begin, to, suppress, the, activity, of, the, arcuate, nucleus, this, has, been, referred, to, as, maturation, of, the, prepubertal, gonadostat, which, becomes, sensitive, to, negative, feedback, by, sex, steroids, the, period, of, hormonal, activity, until, several, months, after, birth, followed, by, suppression, of, activity, may, correspond, to, the, period, of, infant, sexuality, followed, by, a, latency, stage, which, sigmund, freud, described, gonadotropin, and, sex, steroid, levels, fall, to, low, levels, nearly, undetectable, by, current, clinical, assays, for, approximately, another, 8, to, 10, years, of, childhood, evidence, is, accumulating, that, the, reproductive, system, is, not, totally, inactive, during, the, childhood, years, subtle, increases, in, gonadotropin, pulses, occur, and, ovarian, follicles, surrounding, germ, cells, future, eggs, double, in, number, normal, puberty, is, initiated, in, the, hypothalamus, with, de, inhibition, of, the, pulse, generator, in, the, arcuate, nucleus, this, inhibition, of, the, arcuate, nucleus, is, an, ongoing, active, suppression, by, other, areas, of, the, brain, the, signal, and, mechanism, releasing, the, arcuate, nucleus, from, inhibition, have, been, the, subject, of, investigation, for, decades, and, remain, incompletely, understood, leptin, levels, rise, throughout, childhood, and, play, a, part, in, allowing, the, arcuate, nucleus, to, resume, operation, if, the, childhood, inhibition, of, the, arcuate, nucleus, is, interrupted, prematurely, by, injury, to, the, brain, it, may, resume, pulsatile, gonadotropin, release, and, puberty, will, begin, at, an, early, age, neurons, of, the, arcuate, nucleus, secrete, gonadotropin, releasing, hormone, gnrh, into, the, blood, of, the, pituitary, portal, system, an, american, physiologist, ernst, knobil, found, that, the, gnrh, signals, from, the, hypothalamus, induce, pulsed, secretion, of, lh, and, to, a, lesser, degree, fsh, at, roughly, 1, 2, hour, intervals, the, lh, pulses, are, the, consequence, of, pulsatile, gnrh, secretion, by, the, arcuate, nucleus, that, in, turn, is, the, result, of, an, oscillator, or, signal, generator, in, the, central, nervous, system, gnrh, pulse, generator, in, the, years, preceding, physical, puberty, robert, m, boyar, discovered, that, the, gonadotropin, pulses, occur, only, during, sleep, but, as, puberty, progresses, they, can, be, detected, during, the, day, by, the, end, of, puberty, there, is, little, day, night, difference, in, the, amplitude, and, frequency, of, gonadotropin, pulses, some, investigators, have, attributed, the, onset, of, puberty, to, a, resonance, of, oscillators, in, the, brain, by, this, mechanism, the, gonadotropin, pulses, that, occur, primarily, at, night, just, before, puberty, represent, beats, an, array, of, autoamplification, processes, increases, the, production, of, all, of, the, pubertal, hormones, of, the, hypothalamus, pituitary, and, gonads, regulation, of, adrenarche, and, its, relationship, to, maturation, of, the, hypothalamic, gonadal, axis, is, not, fully, understood, and, some, evidence, suggests, it, is, a, parallel, but, largely, independent, process, coincident, with, or, even, preceding, central, puberty, rising, levels, of, adrenal, androgens, termed, adrenarche, can, usually, be, detected, between, 6, and, 11, years, of, age, even, before, the, increasing, gonadotropin, pulses, of, hypothalamic, puberty, adrenal, androgens, contribute, to, the, development, of, pubic, hair, pubarche, adult, body, odor, and, other, androgenic, changes, in, both, sexes, the, primary, clinical, significance, of, the, distinction, between, adrenarche, and, gonadarche, is, that, pubic, hair, and, body, odor, changes, by, themselves, do, not, prove, that, central, puberty, is, underway, for, an, individual, child, early, stages, of, male, hypothalamic, maturation, seem, to, be, very, similar, to, the, early, stages, of, female, puberty, though, occurring, about, 1, 2, years, later, lh, stimulates, the, leydig, cells, of, the, testes, to, make, testosterone, and, blood, levels, begin, to, rise, for, much, of, puberty, nighttime, levels, of, testosterone, are, higher, than, daytime, regularity, of, frequency, and, amplitude, of, gonadotropin, pulses, seems, to, be, less, necessary, for, progression, of, male, than, female, puberty, however, a, significant, portion, of, testosterone, in, adolescent, males, is, converted, to, estradiol, estradiol, mediates, the, growth, spurt, bone, maturation, and, epiphyseal, closure, in, males, just, as, in, females, estradiol, also, induces, at, least, modest, development, of, breast, tissue, gynecomastia, in, a, large, proportion, of, males, males, who, develop, mild, gynecomastia, a, swellings, under, nipples, during, puberty, are, told, the, effects, are, temporary, in, some, male, teenagers, due, to, high, levels, of, estradiol, another, hormonal, change, in, males, takes, place, during, the, teenage, years, for, most, young, men, at, this, point, in, a, male, s, life, the, testosterone, levels, slowly, rise, and, most, of, the, effects, are, mediated, through, the, androgen, receptors, by, way, of, conversion, dihydrotestosterone, in, target, organs, especially, that, of, the, bowels, as, the, amplitude, of, lh, pulses, increases, the, theca, cells, of, the, ovaries, begin, to, produce, testosterone, and, smaller, amounts, of, progesterone, much, of, the, testosterone, moves, into, nearby, cells, known, as, granulosa, cells, smaller, increases, of, fsh, induce, an, increase, in, the, aromatase, activity, of, these, granulosa, cells, which, converts, most, of, the, testosterone, to, estradiol, for, secretion, into, the, circulation, the, remaining, testosterone, together, with, adrenal, androgens, is, responsible, for, the, typical, androgenic, changes, of, female, puberty, pubic, hair, other, androgenic, hair, as, outlined, above, body, odor, acne, the, bioactivity, of, testosterone, is, to, a, large, degree, limited, by, shbg, which, in, turn, is, mainly, controlled, by, estradiol, and, prolactin, levels, estradiol, stimulates, prolactin, decreases, shbg, synthesis, rising, levels, of, estradiol, produce, the, characteristic, estrogenic, body, changes, of, female, puberty, growth, spurt, acceleration, of, bone, maturation, and, closure, breast, growth, increased, fat, composition, growth, of, the, uterus, increased, thickness, of, the, endometrium, and, the, vaginal, mucosa, and, widening, of, the, lower, pelvis, as, the, estradiol, levels, gradually, rise, and, the, other, autoamplification, processes, occur, a, point, of, maturation, is, reached, when, the, feedback, sensitivity, of, the, hypothalamic, gonadostat, becomes, positive, this, attainment, of, positive, feedback, is, the, hallmark, of, female, sexual, maturity, as, it, allows, the, mid, cycle, lh, surge, necessary, for, ovulation, growth, hormone, levels, rise, steadily, throughout, puberty, igf1, levels, rise, and, then, decline, as, puberty, ends, growth, finishes, and, adult, height, is, attained, as, the, estradiol, levels, complete, closure, of, the, epiphyses
