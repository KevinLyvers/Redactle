tapirs, t, e, p, r, tay, p, r, are, large, herbivorous, mammals, belonging, to, the, family, tapiridae, they, are, similar, in, shape, to, a, pig, with, a, short, prehensile, nose, trunk, tapirs, inhabit, jungle, and, forest, regions, of, south, and, central, america, and, southeast, asia, they, are, one, of, three, extant, branches, of, perissodactyla, odd, toed, ungulates, alongside, equines, and, rhinoceroses, only, a, single, genus, tapirus, is, currently, extant, tapirs, migrated, into, south, america, during, the, pleistocene, epoch, from, north, america, after, the, formation, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, tapirs, were, formerly, present, across, north, america, but, became, extinct, in, the, region, at, the, end, of, the, late, pleistocene, around, 12, 000, years, ago, there, are, four, widely, recognized, extant, species, of, tapir, all, in, the, genus, tapirus, of, the, family, tapiridae, they, are, the, south, american, tapir, the, malayan, tapir, baird, s, tapir, and, the, mountain, tapir, in, 2013, a, group, of, researchers, said, they, had, identified, a, fifth, species, of, tapir, the, kabomani, tapir, however, the, existence, of, the, kabomani, tapir, as, a, distinct, species, has, been, widely, disputed, and, recent, genetic, evidence, further, suggests, that, it, actually, is, part, of, the, species, south, american, tapir, the, four, species, are, all, classified, on, the, iucn, red, list, as, endangered, or, vulnerable, the, tapirs, have, a, number, of, extinct, relatives, in, the, superfamily, tapiroidea, the, closest, extant, relatives, of, the, tapirs, are, the, other, odd, toed, ungulates, which, include, horses, wild, asses, zebras, and, rhinoceroses, during, the, late, pleistocene, several, other, species, inhabited, north, america, including, tapirus, veroensis, native, to, the, southern, and, eastern, united, states, with, its, northernmost, records, being, new, york, state, and, tapirus, merriami, and, tapirus, californicus, native, to, western, north, america, these, became, extinct, during, the, quaternary, extinction, event, around, 12, 000, years, ago, along, with, most, of, the, other, large, mammals, of, the, americas, co, inciding, with, the, first, arrival, of, humans, to, the, continent, tapirus, augustus, formerly, placed, in, megatapirus, native, to, southeast, and, east, asia, substantially, larger, than, the, malayan, tapir, also, became, extinct, at, some, point, during, the, late, pleistocene, m, harrisonensis, n, robustus, p, intermedius, p, yagii, p, simplex, giant, tapir, t, augustus, cope, s, tapir, t, haysii, t, veroensis, size, varies, between, types, but, most, tapirs, are, about, 2, m, 6, 1, 2, ft, long, stand, about, 1, m, 3, 1, 4, ft, high, at, the, shoulder, and, weigh, between, 150, and, 300, kg, 330, and, 660, lb, their, coats, are, short, and, range, in, colour, from, reddish, brown, to, grey, to, nearly, black, with, the, notable, exceptions, of, the, malayan, tapir, which, has, a, white, saddle, shaped, marking, on, its, back, and, the, mountain, tapir, which, has, longer, woolly, fur, all, tapirs, have, oval, white, tipped, ears, rounded, protruding, rumps, with, stubby, tails, and, splayed, hooved, toes, with, four, toes, on, the, front, feet, and, three, on, the, hind, feet, which, help, them, to, walk, on, muddy, and, soft, ground, baby, tapirs, of, all, types, have, striped, and, spotted, coats, for, camouflage, females, have, a, single, pair, of, mammary, glands, and, males, have, long, penises, relative, to, their, body, size, the, proboscis, of, the, tapir, is, a, highly, flexible, organ, able, to, move, in, all, directions, allowing, the, animals, to, grab, foliage, that, would, otherwise, be, out, of, reach, tapirs, often, exhibit, the, flehmen, response, a, posture, in, which, they, raise, their, snouts, and, show, their, teeth, to, detect, scents, this, response, is, frequently, exhibited, by, bulls, sniffing, for, signs, of, other, males, or, females, in, oestrus, in, the, area, the, length, of, the, proboscis, varies, among, species, malayan, tapirs, have, the, longest, snouts, and, brazilian, tapirs, have, the, shortest, the, evolution, of, tapir, probosces, made, up, almost, entirely, of, soft, tissues, rather, than, bony, internal, structures, gives, the, tapiridae, skull, a, unique, form, in, comparison, to, other, perissodactyls, with, a, larger, sagittal, crest, orbits, positioned, more, rostrally, a, posteriorly, telescoped, cranium, and, a, more, elongated, and, retracted, nasoincisive, incisure, tapirs, have, brachyodont, or, low, crowned, teeth, that, lack, cementum, their, dental, formula, is, totaling, 42, to, 44, teeth, this, dentition, is, closer, to, that, of, equids, which, may, differ, by, one, less, canine, than, their, other, perissodactyl, relatives, rhinoceroses, their, incisors, are, chisel, shaped, with, the, third, large, conical, upper, incisor, separated, by, a, short, gap, from, the, considerably, smaller, canine, a, much, longer, gap, is, found, between, the, canines, and, premolars, the, first, of, which, may, be, absent, tapirs, are, lophodonts, and, their, cheek, teeth, have, distinct, lophs, ridges, between, protocones, paracones, metacones, and, hypocones, tapirs, have, brown, eyes, often, with, a, bluish, cast, to, them, which, has, been, identified, as, corneal, cloudiness, a, condition, most, commonly, found, in, malayan, tapirs, the, exact, etiology, is, unknown, but, the, cloudiness, may, be, caused, by, excessive, exposure, to, light, or, by, trauma, however, the, tapir, s, sensitive, ears, and, strong, sense, of, smell, help, to, compensate, for, deficiencies, in, vision, tapirs, have, simple, stomachs, and, are, hindgut, fermenters, that, ferment, digested, food, in, a, large, cecum, young, tapirs, reach, sexual, maturity, between, three, and, five, years, of, age, with, females, maturing, earlier, than, males, under, good, conditions, a, healthy, female, tapir, can, reproduce, every, two, years, a, single, young, called, a, calf, is, born, after, a, gestation, of, about, 13, months, the, natural, lifespan, of, a, tapir, is, about, 25, to, 30, years, both, in, the, wild, and, in, zoos, apart, from, mothers, and, their, young, offspring, tapirs, lead, almost, exclusively, solitary, lives, although, they, frequently, live, in, dryland, forests, tapirs, with, access, to, rivers, spend, a, good, deal, of, time, in, and, under, water, feeding, on, soft, vegetation, taking, refuge, from, predators, and, cooling, off, during, hot, periods, tapirs, near, a, water, source, will, swim, sink, to, the, bottom, and, walk, along, the, riverbed, to, feed, and, have, been, known, to, submerge, themselves, to, allow, small, fish, to, pick, parasites, off, their, bulky, bodies, along, with, freshwater, lounging, tapirs, often, wallow, in, mud, pits, which, helps, to, keep, them, cool, and, free, of, insects, in, the, wild, the, tapir, s, diet, consists, of, fruit, berries, and, leaves, particularly, young, tender, vegetation, tapirs, will, spend, many, of, their, waking, hours, foraging, along, well, worn, trails, snouts, to, the, ground, in, search, of, food, baird, s, tapirs, have, been, observed, to, eat, around, 40, kg, 85, lb, of, vegetation, in, one, day, tapirs, are, largely, nocturnal, and, crepuscular, although, the, smaller, mountain, tapir, of, the, andes, is, generally, more, active, during, the, day, than, its, congeners, they, have, monocular, vision, copulation, may, occur, in, or, out, of, water, in, captivity, mating, pairs, will, often, copulate, several, times, during, oestrus, intromission, lasts, between, 10, and, 20, minutes, adult, tapirs, are, large, enough, to, have, few, natural, predators, and, the, thick, skin, on, the, backs, of, their, necks, helps, to, protect, them, from, threats, such, as, jaguars, crocodiles, anacondas, and, tigers, the, creatures, are, also, able, to, run, fairly, quickly, considering, their, size, and, cumbersome, appearance, finding, shelter, in, the, thick, undergrowth, of, the, forest, or, in, water, hunting, for, meat, and, hides, has, substantially, reduced, their, numbers, and, more, recently, habitat, loss, has, resulted, in, the, conservation, watch, listing, of, all, four, species, the, brazilian, tapir, is, classified, as, vulnerable, and, baird, s, tapir, the, mountain, tapir, and, the, malayan, tapir, are, endangered, according, to, 2022, study, published, in, the, neotropical, biology, and, conservation, the, lowland, tapir, in, the, atlantic, forest, is, at, risk, of, complete, extinction, as, a, result, of, anthropogenic, pressures, in, particular, hunting, deforestation, and, population, isolation, tapirs, originated, from, the, tapiroids, a, group, of, primitive, perissodactyls, that, inhabited, north, america, and, asia, during, the, eocene, epoch, with, tapirs, probably, originating, from, the, family, helaletidae, the, oldest, known, members, of, the, family, tapiridae, such, as, protapirus, are, known, from, the, early, oligocene, of, europe, the, oldest, representatives, of, the, modern, genus, tapirus, appeared, in, europe, during, the, mid, miocene, with, tapirus, dispersing, into, asia, and, north, america, by, the, late, miocene, tapirus, became, extinct, in, europe, around, the, end, of, the, pliocene, tapirs, dispersed, into, south, america, during, pleistocene, as, part, of, the, great, american, biotic, interchange, with, their, oldest, records, on, the, continent, dating, to, around, 2, 6, 1, million, years, ago, approximate, divergence, times, based, on, a, 2013, analysis, of, mtdna, sequences, are, 0, 5, ma, for, t, kabomani, and, the, t, terrestris, t, pinchaque, clade, 5, ma, for, t, bairdii, and, the, three, south, american, tapirs, and, 9, ma, for, the, branching, of, t, indicus, t, pinchaque, arises, from, within, a, paraphyletic, complex, of, t, terrestris, populations, t, indicus, malayan, tapir, t, terrestris, south, american, tapir, ecuador, cluster, t, pinchaque, mountain, tapir, t, terrestris, south, american, tapir, other, clusters, t, bairdii, baird, s, tapir, the, species, of, tapir, have, the, following, chromosomal, numbers, the, malayan, tapir, the, species, most, isolated, geographically, and, genetically, has, a, significantly, smaller, number, of, chromosomes, and, has, been, found, to, share, fewer, homologies, with, the, three, types, of, american, tapirs, a, number, of, conserved, autosomes, 13, between, karyotypes, of, baird, s, tapir, and, the, south, american, tapir, and, 15, between, baird, s, and, the, mountain, tapir, have, also, been, found, in, the, american, species, that, are, not, found, in, the, asian, animal, however, geographic, proximity, is, not, an, absolute, predictor, of, genetic, similarity, for, instance, g, banded, preparations, have, revealed, malayan, baird, s, and, south, american, tapirs, have, identical, x, chromosomes, while, mountain, tapirs, are, separated, by, a, heterochromatic, addition, deletion, lack, of, genetic, diversity, in, tapir, populations, has, become, a, major, source, of, concern, for, conservationists, habitat, loss, has, isolated, already, small, populations, of, wild, tapirs, putting, each, group, in, greater, danger, of, dying, out, completely, even, in, zoos, genetic, diversity, is, limited, all, captive, mountain, tapirs, for, example, are, descended, from, only, two, founder, individuals, hybrids, of, baird, s, and, the, south, american, tapirs, were, bred, at, the, san, francisco, zoo, around, 1969, and, later, produced, a, backcross, second, generation, a, number, of, conservation, projects, have, been, started, around, the, world, the, tapir, specialist, group, a, unit, of, the, iucn, species, survival, commission, strives, to, conserve, biological, diversity, by, stimulating, developing, and, conducting, practical, programs, to, study, save, restore, and, manage, the, four, species, of, tapir, and, their, remaining, habitats, in, central, and, south, america, and, southeast, asia, the, baird, s, tapir, project, of, costa, rica, begun, in, 1994, is, the, longest, ongoing, tapir, project, in, the, world, it, involves, placing, radio, collars, on, tapirs, in, costa, rica, s, corcovado, national, park, to, study, their, social, systems, and, habitat, preferences, the, lowland, lowland, tapir, conservation, initiative, is, a, conservation, and, research, organization, founded, by, patr, cia, medici, focused, on, tapir, conservation, in, brazil, tapirs, are, generally, shy, but, when, scared, they, can, defend, themselves, with, their, very, powerful, jaws, in, 1998, a, zookeeper, in, oklahoma, city, was, mauled, and, had, an, arm, severed, after, opening, the, door, to, a, female, tapir, s, enclosure, to, push, food, inside, the, tapir, s, two, month, old, baby, also, occupied, the, cage, at, the, time, in, 2006, carlos, manuel, rodriguez, echandi, who, was, then, the, costa, rican, environmental, minister, became, lost, in, the, corcovado, national, park, and, was, found, by, a, search, party, with, a, nasty, bite, from, a, wild, tapir, in, 2013, a, two, year, old, girl, suffered, stomach, and, arm, injuries, after, being, mauled, by, a, south, american, tapir, in, dublin, zoo, during, a, supervised, experience, in, the, tapir, enclosure, dublin, zoo, pleaded, guilty, to, breaching, health, and, safety, regulations, and, was, ordered, to, pay, 5, 000, to, charity, however, such, examples, are, rare, for, the, most, part, tapirs, are, likely, to, avoid, confrontation, in, favour, of, running, from, predators, hiding, or, if, possible, submerging, themselves, in, nearby, water, until, a, threat, is, gone, frank, buck, wrote, about, an, attack, by, a, tapir, in, 1926, which, he, described, in, his, book, bring, em, back, alive, tapirs, feature, in, the, folklore, of, several, cultures, around, the, world, in, japan, tapirs, are, associated, with, the, mythological, baku, believed, to, ward, off, nightmares, in, south, america, tapirs, are, associated, with, the, creation, of, the, earth
