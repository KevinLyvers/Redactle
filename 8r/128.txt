the, jaws, are, a, pair, of, opposable, articulated, structures, at, the, entrance, of, the, mouth, typically, used, for, grasping, and, manipulating, food, the, term, jaws, is, also, broadly, applied, to, the, whole, of, the, structures, constituting, the, vault, of, the, mouth, and, serving, to, open, and, close, it, and, is, part, of, the, body, plan, of, humans, and, most, animals, in, arthropods, the, jaws, are, chitinous, and, oppose, laterally, and, may, consist, of, mandibles, or, chelicerae, these, jaws, are, often, composed, of, numerous, mouthparts, their, function, is, fundamentally, for, food, acquisition, conveyance, to, the, mouth, and, or, initial, processing, mastication, or, chewing, many, mouthparts, and, associate, structures, such, as, pedipalps, are, modified, legs, in, most, vertebrates, the, jaws, are, bony, or, cartilaginous, and, oppose, vertically, comprising, an, upper, jaw, and, a, lower, jaw, the, vertebrate, jaw, is, derived, from, the, most, anterior, two, pharyngeal, arches, supporting, the, gills, and, usually, bears, numerous, teeth, the, vertebrate, jaw, probably, originally, evolved, in, the, silurian, period, and, appeared, in, the, placoderm, fish, which, further, diversified, in, the, devonian, the, two, most, anterior, pharyngeal, arches, are, thought, to, have, become, the, jaw, itself, and, the, hyoid, arch, respectively, the, hyoid, system, suspends, the, jaw, from, the, braincase, of, the, skull, permitting, great, mobility, of, the, jaws, while, there, is, no, fossil, evidence, directly, to, support, this, theory, it, makes, sense, in, light, of, the, numbers, of, pharyngeal, arches, that, are, visible, in, extant, jawed, vertebrates, the, gnathostomes, which, have, seven, arches, and, primitive, jawless, vertebrates, the, agnatha, which, have, nine, the, original, selective, advantage, offered, by, the, jaw, may, not, be, related, to, feeding, but, rather, to, increased, respiration, efficiency, the, jaws, were, used, in, the, buccal, pump, observable, in, modern, fish, and, amphibians, that, pumps, water, across, the, gills, of, fish, or, air, into, the, lungs, in, the, case, of, amphibians, over, evolutionary, time, the, more, familiar, use, of, jaws, to, humans, in, feeding, was, selected, for, and, became, a, very, important, function, in, vertebrates, many, teleost, fish, have, substantially, modified, jaws, for, suction, feeding, and, jaw, protrusion, resulting, in, highly, complex, jaws, with, dozens, of, bones, involved, the, jaw, in, tetrapods, is, substantially, simplified, compared, to, fish, most, of, the, upper, jaw, bones, premaxilla, maxilla, jugal, quadratojugal, and, quadrate, have, been, fused, to, the, braincase, while, the, lower, jaw, bones, dentary, splenial, angular, surangular, and, articular, have, been, fused, together, into, a, unit, called, the, mandible, the, jaw, articulates, via, a, hinge, joint, between, the, quadrate, and, articular, the, jaws, of, tetrapods, exhibit, varying, degrees, of, mobility, between, jaw, bones, some, species, have, jaw, bones, completely, fused, while, others, may, have, joints, allowing, for, mobility, of, the, dentary, quadrate, or, maxilla, the, snake, skull, shows, the, greatest, degree, of, cranial, kinesis, which, allows, the, snake, to, swallow, large, prey, items, in, mammals, the, jaws, are, made, up, of, the, mandible, lower, jaw, and, the, maxilla, upper, jaw, in, the, ape, there, is, a, reinforcement, to, the, lower, jaw, bone, called, the, simian, shelf, in, the, evolution, of, the, mammalian, jaw, two, of, the, bones, of, the, jaw, structure, the, articular, bone, of, the, lower, jaw, and, quadrate, were, reduced, in, size, and, incorporated, into, the, ear, while, many, others, have, been, fused, together, as, a, result, mammals, show, little, or, no, cranial, kinesis, and, the, mandible, is, attached, to, the, temporal, bone, by, the, temporomandibular, joints, temporomandibular, joint, dysfunction, is, a, common, disorder, of, these, joints, characterized, by, pain, clicking, and, limitation, of, mandibular, movement, especially, in, the, therian, mammal, the, premaxilla, that, constituted, the, anterior, tip, of, the, upper, jaw, in, reptiles, has, reduced, in, size, and, most, of, the, mesenchyme, at, the, ancestral, upper, jaw, tip, has, become, a, protruded, mammalian, nose, sea, urchins, possess, unique, jaws, which, display, five, part, symmetry, termed, the, aristotle, s, lantern, each, unit, of, the, jaw, holds, a, single, perpetually, growing, tooth, composed, of, crystalline, calcium, carbonate
