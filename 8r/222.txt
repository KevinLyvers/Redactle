male, symbol, is, the, sex, of, an, organism, that, produces, the, gamete, sex, cell, known, as, sperm, which, fuses, with, the, larger, female, gamete, or, ovum, in, the, process, of, fertilisation, a, male, organism, cannot, reproduce, sexually, without, access, to, at, least, one, ovum, from, a, female, but, some, organisms, can, reproduce, both, sexually, and, asexually, most, male, mammals, including, male, humans, have, a, y, chromosome, which, codes, for, the, production, of, larger, amounts, of, testosterone, to, develop, male, reproductive, organs, in, humans, the, word, male, can, also, be, used, to, refer, to, gender, in, the, social, sense, of, gender, role, or, gender, identity, the, use, of, male, in, regard, to, sex, and, gender, has, been, subject, to, discussion, the, existence, of, separate, sexes, has, evolved, independently, at, different, times, and, in, different, lineages, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, the, repeated, pattern, is, sexual, reproduction, in, isogamous, species, with, two, or, more, mating, types, with, gametes, of, identical, form, and, behavior, but, different, at, the, molecular, level, to, anisogamous, species, with, gametes, of, male, and, female, types, to, oogamous, species, in, which, the, female, gamete, is, very, much, larger, than, the, male, and, has, no, ability, to, move, there, is, a, good, argument, that, this, pattern, was, driven, by, the, physical, constraints, on, the, mechanisms, by, which, two, gametes, get, together, as, required, for, sexual, reproduction, accordingly, sex, is, defined, across, species, by, the, type, of, gametes, produced, i, e, spermatozoa, vs, ova, and, differences, between, males, and, females, in, one, lineage, are, not, always, predictive, of, differences, in, another, male, female, dimorphism, between, organisms, or, reproductive, organs, of, different, sexes, is, not, limited, to, animals, male, gametes, are, produced, by, chytrids, diatoms, and, land, plants, among, others, in, land, plants, female, and, male, designate, not, only, the, female, and, male, gamete, producing, organisms, and, structures, but, also, the, structures, of, the, sporophytes, that, give, rise, to, male, and, female, plants, the, evolution, of, anisogamy, led, to, the, evolution, of, male, and, female, function, before, the, evolution, of, anisogamy, mating, types, in, a, species, were, isogamous, the, same, size, and, both, could, move, catalogued, only, as, or, types, 216, in, anisogamy, the, mating, type, is, called, a, gamete, the, male, gamete, is, smaller, than, the, female, gamete, and, usually, mobile, anisogamy, remains, poorly, understood, as, there, is, no, fossil, record, of, its, emergence, numerous, theories, exist, as, to, why, anisogamy, emerged, many, share, a, common, thread, in, that, larger, female, gametes, are, more, likely, to, survive, and, that, smaller, male, gametes, are, more, likely, to, find, other, gametes, because, they, can, travel, faster, current, models, often, fail, to, account, for, why, isogamy, remains, in, a, few, species, anisogamy, appears, to, have, evolved, multiple, times, from, isogamy, for, example, female, volvocales, a, type, of, green, algae, evolved, from, the, plus, mating, type, 222, although, sexual, evolution, emerged, at, least, 1, 2, billion, years, ago, the, lack, of, anisogamous, fossil, records, make, it, hard, to, pinpoint, when, males, evolved, one, theory, suggests, male, evolved, from, the, dominant, mating, type, called, mating, type, minus, a, common, symbol, used, to, represent, the, male, sex, is, the, mars, symbol, a, circle, with, an, arrow, pointing, northeast, the, unicode, code, point, is, the, symbol, is, identical, to, the, planetary, symbol, of, mars, it, was, first, used, to, denote, sex, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1751, the, symbol, is, sometimes, seen, as, a, stylized, representation, of, the, shield, and, spear, of, the, roman, god, mars, according, to, william, t, stearn, however, this, derivation, is, fanciful, and, all, the, historical, evidence, favours, the, conclusion, of, the, french, classical, scholar, claude, de, saumaise, salmasius, 1588, 1683, that, it, is, derived, from, the, contraction, of, a, greek, name, for, the, planet, mars, which, is, thouros, borrowed, from, old, french, masle, from, latin, masculus, masculine, male, worthy, of, a, man, diminutive, of, m, s, male, person, or, animal, male, in, humans, the, word, male, can, be, used, in, the, context, of, gender, such, as, for, gender, role, or, gender, identity, of, a, man, or, boy, for, example, according, to, merriam, webster, male, can, refer, to, having, a, gender, identity, that, is, the, opposite, of, female, according, to, the, cambridge, dictionary, male, can, mean, belonging, or, relating, to, men, male, can, also, refer, to, a, shape, of, connectors, species, that, are, divided, into, females, and, males, are, classified, as, gonochoric, in, animals, as, dioecious, in, seed, plants, and, as, dioicous, in, cryptogams, 82, males, can, coexist, with, hermaphrodites, a, sexual, system, called, androdioecy, they, can, also, coexist, with, females, and, hermaphrodites, a, sexual, system, called, trioecy, the, sex, of, a, particular, organism, may, be, determined, by, a, number, of, factors, these, may, be, genetic, or, environmental, or, may, naturally, change, during, the, course, of, an, organism, s, life, although, most, species, have, only, two, sexes, either, male, or, female, hermaphroditic, animals, such, as, worms, have, both, male, and, female, reproductive, organs, not, all, species, share, a, common, sex, determination, system, in, most, animals, including, humans, sex, is, determined, genetically, however, species, such, as, cymothoa, exigua, change, sex, depending, on, the, number, of, females, present, in, the, vicinity, most, mammals, including, humans, are, genetically, determined, as, such, by, the, xy, sex, determination, system, where, males, have, xy, as, opposed, to, xx, in, females, sex, chromosomes, it, is, also, possible, in, a, variety, of, species, including, humans, to, be, xx, male, or, have, other, karyotypes, during, reproduction, a, male, can, give, either, an, x, sperm, or, a, y, sperm, while, a, female, can, only, give, an, x, egg, a, y, sperm, and, an, x, egg, produce, a, male, while, an, x, sperm, and, an, x, egg, produce, a, female, the, part, of, the, y, chromosome, which, is, responsible, for, maleness, is, the, sex, determining, region, of, the, y, chromosome, the, sry, the, sry, activates, sox9, which, forms, feedforward, loops, with, fgf9, and, pgd, 2, in, the, gonads, allowing, the, levels, of, these, genes, to, stay, high, enough, in, order, to, cause, male, development, for, example, fgf9, is, responsible, for, development, of, the, spermatic, cords, and, the, multiplication, of, sertoli, cells, both, of, which, are, crucial, to, male, sexual, development, the, zw, sex, determination, system, where, males, have, zz, as, opposed, to, zw, in, females, sex, chromosomes, may, be, found, in, birds, and, some, insects, mostly, butterflies, and, moths, and, other, organisms, members, of, the, insect, order, hymenoptera, such, as, ants, and, bees, are, often, determined, by, haplodiploidy, where, most, males, are, haploid, and, females, and, some, sterile, males, are, diploid, however, fertile, diploid, males, may, still, appear, in, some, species, such, as, cataglyphis, cursor, in, some, species, of, reptiles, such, as, alligators, sex, is, determined, by, the, temperature, at, which, the, egg, is, incubated, other, species, such, as, some, snails, practice, sex, change, adults, start, out, male, then, become, female, in, tropical, clown, fish, the, dominant, individual, in, a, group, becomes, female, while, the, other, ones, are, male, in, many, arthropods, sex, is, determined, by, infection, with, parasitic, endosymbiotic, bacteria, of, the, genus, wolbachia, the, bacterium, can, only, be, transmitted, via, infected, ova, and, the, presence, of, the, obligate, endoparasite, may, be, required, for, female, sexual, viability, male, animals, have, evolved, to, use, secondary, sex, characteristics, as, a, way, of, displaying, traits, that, signify, their, fitness, sexual, selection, is, believed, to, be, the, driving, force, behind, the, development, of, these, characteristics, differences, in, physical, size, and, the, ability, to, fulfill, the, requirements, of, sexual, selection, have, contributed, significantly, to, the, outcome, of, secondary, sex, characteristics, in, each, species, in, many, species, males, differ, from, females, in, more, ways, than, just, the, production, of, sperm, for, example, in, some, insects, and, fish, the, male, is, smaller, than, the, female, in, seed, plants, the, sporophyte, sex, organ, of, a, single, organism, includes, both, the, male, and, female, parts, in, mammals, including, humans, males, are, typically, larger, than, females, this, is, often, attributed, to, the, need, for, male, mammals, to, be, physically, stronger, and, more, competitive, in, order, to, win, mating, opportunities, in, humans, specifically, males, have, more, body, hair, and, muscle, mass, than, females, birds, often, exhibit, colorful, plumage, that, attracts, females, this, is, true, for, many, species, of, birds, where, the, male, displays, more, vibrant, colors, than, the, female, making, them, more, noticeable, to, potential, mates, these, characteristics, have, evolved, over, time, as, a, result, of, sexual, selection, as, males, who, exhibited, these, traits, were, more, successful, in, attracting, mates, and, passing, on, their, genes
