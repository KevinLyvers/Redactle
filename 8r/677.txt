acridotheres, tristis, melanosternus, acridotheres, tristis, tristis, paradisaea, tristis, linnaeus, 1766, the, common, myna, or, indian, myna, acridotheres, tristis, sometimes, spelled, mynah, is, a, bird, in, the, family, sturnidae, native, to, asia, an, omnivorous, open, woodland, bird, with, a, strong, territorial, instinct, the, common, myna, has, adapted, extremely, well, to, urban, environments, the, range, of, the, common, myna, is, increasing, at, such, a, rapid, rate, that, in, 2000, the, iucn, species, survival, commission, declared, it, one, of, the, world, s, most, invasive, species, and, one, of, only, three, birds, listed, among, 100, of, the, world, s, worst, invasive, species, that, pose, a, threat, to, biodiversity, agriculture, and, human, interests, in, particular, the, species, poses, a, serious, threat, to, the, ecosystems, of, australia, where, it, was, named, the, most, important, pest, problem, in, 2008, in, 1760, the, french, zoologist, mathurin, jacques, brisson, included, a, description, of, the, common, myna, in, his, ornithologie, based, on, a, specimen, that, he, mistakenly, believed, had, been, collected, in, the, philippines, he, used, the, french, name, le, merle, des, philippines, and, the, latin, merula, philippensis, although, brisson, coined, latin, names, they, do, not, conform, to, the, binominal, system, and, are, not, recognised, by, the, international, commission, on, zoological, nomenclature, when, the, swedish, naturalist, carl, linnaeus, updated, his, systema, naturae, in, 1766, for, the, 12th, edition, he, added, 240, species, that, had, been, previously, described, by, brisson, one, of, them, was, the, common, myna, linnaeus, included, a, brief, description, coined, the, binominal, name, paradisea, tristis, and, cited, brisson, s, work, the, type, location, was, subsequently, corrected, to, pondicherry, in, southern, india, the, specific, name, tristis, is, latin, for, sad, or, gloomy, this, species, is, now, placed, in, the, genus, acridotheres, that, was, introduced, by, the, french, ornithologist, louis, pierre, vieillot, in, 1816, the, generic, name, acridotheres, is, from, the, greek, akridos, meaning, locust, and, theras, meaning, hunter, two, subspecies, are, recognised, the, sri, lankan, subspecies, melanosternus, is, darker, than, the, indian, subspecies, tristis, and, has, half, black, and, half, white, primary, coverts, and, a, larger, yellow, cheek, patch, the, common, myna, is, readily, identified, by, the, brown, body, black, hooded, head, and, the, bare, yellow, patch, behind, the, eye, the, bill, and, legs, are, bright, yellow, there, is, a, white, patch, on, the, outer, primaries, and, the, wing, lining, on, the, underside, is, white, the, sexes, are, similar, and, birds, are, usually, seen, in, pairs, the, common, myna, obeys, gloger, s, rule, in, that, the, birds, from, northwestern, india, tend, to, be, paler, than, their, darker, counterparts, in, southern, india, the, calls, includes, croaks, squawks, chirps, clicks, whistles, and, growls, and, the, bird, often, fluffs, its, feathers, and, bobs, its, head, in, singing, the, common, myna, screeches, warnings, to, its, mate, or, other, birds, in, cases, of, predators, in, proximity, or, when, it, is, about, to, take, off, flying, common, mynas, are, popular, as, cage, birds, for, their, singing, and, speaking, abilities, before, sleeping, in, communal, roosts, common, mynas, vocalise, in, unison, which, is, known, as, communal, noise, morphometry, the, common, myna, is, native, to, asia, with, its, initial, home, range, spanning, iran, pakistan, india, nepal, bhutan, bangladesh, and, sri, lanka, afghanistan, uzbekistan, tajikistan, turkmenistan, myanmar, malaysia, singapore, peninsular, thailand, indochina, japan, both, mainland, japan, and, the, ryukyu, islands, and, china, the, common, myna, has, been, introduced, to, many, other, parts, of, the, world, such, as, canada, australia, israel, new, zealand, new, caledonia, fiji, the, united, states, south, florida, only, south, africa, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, uzbekistan, the, cayman, islands, islands, in, the, indian, ocean, the, seychelles, from, which, it, was, subsequently, eradicated, at, great, expense, mauritius, r, union, madagascar, the, maldives, the, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, and, the, lakshadweep, archipelago, and, also, in, islands, of, the, atlantic, such, as, ascension, and, saint, helena, pacific, ocean, and, cyprus, february, 2022, the, range, of, the, common, myna, is, increasing, to, the, extent, that, in, 2000, the, iucn, species, survival, commission, declared, it, among, 100, of, the, world, s, worst, invasive, species, it, is, typically, found, in, open, woodland, cultivation, and, around, habitation, although, it, is, an, adaptable, species, its, population, is, abnormal, and, very, much, considered, a, pest, in, singapore, where, it, is, locally, called, as, gembala, kerbau, literally, buffalo, shepherd, due, to, competition, with, the, related, introduced, javan, myna, the, common, myna, thrives, in, urban, and, suburban, environments, in, canberra, for, instance, 110, common, mynas, were, released, between, 1968, and, 1971, by, 1991, common, myna, population, density, in, canberra, averaged, 15, birds, per, square, kilometer, only, three, years, later, a, second, study, found, an, average, population, density, of, 75, birds, per, square, kilometer, in, the, same, area, the, bird, likely, owes, its, success, in, the, urban, and, suburban, settings, of, sydney, and, canberra, to, its, evolutionary, origins, having, evolved, in, the, open, woodlands, of, india, the, common, myna, is, pre, adapted, to, habitats, with, tall, vertical, structures, and, little, to, no, vegetative, ground, cover, features, characteristic, of, city, streets, and, urban, nature, preserves, the, common, myna, along, with, common, starlings, house, sparrows, and, feral, rock, doves, is, a, nuisance, to, city, buildings, its, nests, block, gutters, and, drainpipes, causing, water, damage, to, building, exteriors, common, mynas, are, believed, to, pair, for, life, they, breed, through, much, of, the, year, depending, on, the, location, building, their, nest, in, a, hole, in, a, tree, or, wall, they, breed, at, elevations, of, 0, 3, 000, m, 0, 9, 843, ft, in, the, himalayas, the, normal, clutch, size, is, 4, 6, eggs, the, average, size, of, the, egg, is, 30, 8, by, 21, 99, millimetres, 1, 1, 4, in, 3, 4, in, the, incubation, period, is, 17, to, 18, days, and, fledging, period, is, 22, to, 24, days, the, asian, koel, is, sometimes, brood, parasitic, on, this, species, nesting, material, used, by, common, mynas, includes, twigs, roots, tow, and, rubbish, common, mynas, have, been, known, to, use, tissue, paper, tin, foil, and, sloughed, off, snake, skin, during, the, breeding, season, the, daytime, activity, time, budget, of, the, common, myna, in, pune, in, april, to, june, 1978, has, been, recorded, to, comprise, the, following, nesting, activity, 42, scanning, the, environment, 28, locomotion, 12, feeding, 4, vocalisation, 7, and, preening, related, activities, interactions, and, other, activities, 7, the, common, myna, uses, the, nests, of, woodpeckers, parakeets, etc, and, easily, takes, to, nest, boxes, it, has, been, recorded, evicting, the, chicks, of, previously, nesting, pairs, by, holding, them, in, the, beak, and, later, sometimes, not, even, using, the, emptied, nest, boxes, this, aggressive, behaviour, contributes, to, its, success, as, an, invasive, species, there, is, also, some, evidence, that, shows, that, in, introduced, environments, the, species, chooses, to, nest, in, more, modified, and, artificial, structures, than, in, natural, tree, cavities, when, compared, to, native, species, like, most, starlings, the, common, myna, is, omnivorous, it, feeds, on, insects, grubs, earthworms, arachnids, crustaceans, reptiles, small, mammals, seeds, grain, fruits, flower, nectar, and, petals, and, discarded, waste, from, human, habitation, it, forages, on, the, ground, among, grass, for, insects, and, especially, for, grasshoppers, from, which, it, gets, the, generic, name, acridotheres, grasshopper, hunter, it, however, feeds, on, a, wide, range, of, insects, mostly, picked, from, the, ground, it, is, a, cross, pollinator, of, flowers, such, as, salmalia, and, erythrina, it, walks, on, the, ground, with, occasional, hops, and, is, an, opportunistic, feeder, on, the, insects, disturbed, by, grazing, cattle, as, well, as, fired, grass, fields, they, prey, on, eggs, and, young, of, other, birds, such, as, hawai, i, akepas, loxops, coccineus, they, sometimes, even, wade, in, shallow, waters, to, catch, fish, living, in, close, proximity, to, human, made, habitats, common, mynas, may, also, appear, near, roadsides, to, feed, on, roadkill, common, mynas, roost, communally, throughout, the, year, either, in, pure, or, mixed, flocks, with, jungle, mynas, rosy, starlings, house, crows, jungle, crows, cattle, egrets, and, rose, ringed, parakeets, and, other, birds, the, roost, population, can, range, from, less, than, one, hundred, to, thousands, the, time, of, arrival, of, mynas, at, the, roost, starts, before, and, ends, just, after, sunset, the, mynas, depart, before, sunrise, the, time, and, timespan, of, arrival, and, departure, time, taken, for, final, settlement, at, the, roost, duration, of, communal, sleep, flock, size, and, population, vary, seasonally, the, function, of, communal, roosting, is, to, synchronise, various, social, activities, avoid, predators, exchange, information, about, food, sources, communal, displays, pre, roosting, and, post, roosting, consist, of, aerial, maneuvers, which, are, exhibited, in, the, pre, breeding, season, november, to, march, it, is, assumed, that, this, behaviour, is, related, to, pair, formation, the, iucn, declared, the, common, myna, as, one, of, only, three, birds, among, the, world, s, 100, worst, invasive, species, the, other, two, being, the, red, vented, bulbul, and, the, common, starling, the, french, introduced, it, in, the, 18th, century, from, pondicherry, to, mauritius, with, the, aim, of, controlling, insects, even, levying, a, fine, on, anyone, persecuting, the, bird, it, has, since, been, introduced, widely, elsewhere, including, adjacent, areas, in, southeast, asia, madagascar, the, middle, east, south, africa, the, united, states, argentina, germany, spain, and, portugal, the, united, kingdom, australia, new, zealand, and, various, oceanic, islands, in, the, indian, and, pacific, oceans, including, prominent, populations, in, fiji, and, hawaii, the, common, myna, is, regarded, as, a, pest, in, south, africa, north, america, the, middle, east, australia, new, zealand, and, many, pacific, islands, it, is, particularly, problematic, in, australia, several, methods, have, been, tried, to, control, the, bird, s, numbers, and, protect, native, species, in, australia, the, common, myna, is, an, invasive, pest, they, are, often, the, predominant, bird, in, urban, areas, along, the, whole, east, coast, in, a, 2008, popular, vote, the, bird, was, named, the, most, important, pest, problem, in, australia, they, have, earned, the, nickname, flying, rats, due, to, their, numbers, and, their, scavenging, behaviour, they, are, also, known, as, the, cane, toad, of, the, sky, however, there, is, little, scientific, consensus, concerning, the, extent, of, its, impact, on, native, species, the, common, myna, was, first, introduced, to, australia, between, 1863, and, 1872, in, victoria, to, control, insects, in, the, market, gardens, of, melbourne, the, bird, is, likely, to, have, spread, to, new, south, wales, where, it, is, currently, most, populous, at, around, the, same, time, but, documentation, is, uncertain, the, bird, was, later, introduced, to, queensland, as, a, predator, of, grasshoppers, and, cane, beetles, common, myna, populations, in, australia, are, now, concentrated, along, the, eastern, coast, around, sydney, and, its, surrounding, suburbs, with, sparser, populations, in, victoria, and, a, few, isolated, communities, in, queensland, during, 2009, several, municipal, councils, in, new, south, wales, began, trials, of, catching, myna, birds, in, an, effort, to, reduce, numbers, the, myna, can, live, and, breed, in, a, wide, range, of, temperatures, ranging, from, the, frosty, winters, of, canberra, to, the, tropical, climate, of, cairns, self, sustaining, populations, have, been, found, in, regions, with, a, mean, monthly, highest, temperature, no, less, than, 23, 2, c, 73, 8, f, and, a, mean, monthly, lowest, temperature, no, less, than, 0, 4, c, 31, 3, f, implying, that, the, common, myna, could, spread, from, sydney, northwards, along, the, eastern, coast, to, cairns, and, westwards, along, the, southern, coast, to, adelaide, but, not, to, tasmania, darwin, or, the, arid, outback, regions, in, 2019, common, mynas, were, added, to, the, list, of, invasive, alien, species, of, union, concern, they, have, established, in, spain, and, portugal, and, were, introduced, to, france, where, they, occasionally, bred, the, common, myna, was, introduced, to, both, the, north, island, and, south, island, of, new, zealand, in, the, 1870s, however, the, cooler, summer, temperatures, in, the, south, island, appear, to, have, impeded, the, breeding, success, rate, of, the, southern, populations, preventing, the, proliferation, of, the, species, which, was, largely, non, existent, there, by, the, 1890s, in, contrast, the, north, island, population, was, able, to, breed, more, successfully, and, large, portions, of, the, north, island, are, now, populated, however, in, the, southern, reaches, of, the, north, island, the, cooler, summer, temperatures, like, those, of, the, south, island, have, prevented, the, establishment, of, large, myna, populations, since, the, 1950s, mynas, have, spread, northwards, and, presently, inhabit, beyond, the, waikato, region, leading, to, a, majority, of, its, successful, population, thriving, upon, lower, latitude, regions, due, to, the, warmer, climate, at, present, mynas, have, become, especially, common, in, regions, of, lower, latitude, particularly, the, northland, region, but, rarely, found, south, of, whanganui, in, south, africa, where, it, escaped, into, the, wild, in, 1902, it, has, become, very, common, and, its, distribution, is, greater, where, human, populations, are, greater, or, where, there, is, more, human, disturbance, the, bird, is, also, notorious, for, being, a, pest, kicking, other, birds, out, of, their, nests, and, killing, their, young, due, to, the, myna, s, strong, territorial, instinct, in, south, africa, it, is, considered, somewhat, of, a, major, pest, and, disturbance, of, the, natural, habitat, as, a, result, it, has, been, declared, an, invasive, species, requiring, it, to, be, controlled, morphological, studies, show, that, the, process, of, spatial, sorting, is, at, work, on, the, range, expansion, of, a, tristis, in, south, africa, dispersal, relevant, traits, are, significantly, correlated, with, distance, from, the, range, core, with, strong, sexual, dimorphism, indicative, of, sex, biased, dispersal, morphological, variations, are, significant, in, wing, and, head, traits, of, females, suggesting, females, as, the, primary, dispersing, sex, in, contrast, traits, not, related, to, dispersal, such, as, those, associated, with, foraging, show, no, signs, of, spatial, sorting, but, are, significantly, affected, by, environmental, variables, such, as, vegetation, and, intensity, of, urbanisation, in, hawaii, it, is, out, competing, many, native, birds, for, food, and, nesting, areas, to, study, the, invasion, genetics, and, landscape, scale, dynamics, of, a, tristis, scientists, have, recently, developed, 16, polymorphic, nuclear, microsatellite, markers, using, the, next, generation, sequencing, ngs, approach, the, common, myna, is, a, hollow, nesting, species, that, is, it, nests, and, breeds, in, protected, hollows, found, either, naturally, in, trees, or, artificially, on, buildings, for, example, recessed, windowsills, or, low, eaves, compared, to, native, hollow, nesting, species, the, common, myna, is, extremely, aggressive, and, breeding, males, will, actively, defend, areas, ranging, up, to, 0, 83, hectares, in, size, though, males, in, densely, populated, urban, settings, tend, to, only, defend, the, area, immediately, surrounding, their, nests, this, aggressiveness, has, enabled, the, common, myna, to, displace, many, breeding, pairs, of, native, hollow, nesters, thereby, reducing, their, reproductive, success, in, australia, their, aggressiveness, has, enabled, them, to, chase, native, birds, as, large, as, galahs, out, of, their, nests, the, common, myna, is, also, known, to, maintain, up, to, two, roosts, simultaneously, a, temporary, summer, roost, close, to, a, breeding, site, where, the, entire, local, male, community, sleeps, during, the, summer, the, period, of, highest, aggression, and, a, permanent, all, year, roost, where, the, female, broods, and, incubates, overnight, both, male, and, female, common, mynas, will, fiercely, protect, both, roosts, at, all, times, leading, to, further, exclusion, of, native, birds, the, common, myna, which, feeds, mostly, on, ground, dwelling, insects, tropical, fruits, such, as, grapes, plums, and, some, berries, and, in, urban, areas, discarded, human, food, poses, a, serious, threat, to, australian, blueberry, crops, though, its, main, threat, is, to, native, bird, species, in, hawaii, where, the, common, myna, was, introduced, to, control, pest, armyworms, and, cutworms, in, sugarcane, crops, the, bird, has, helped, to, spread, the, robust, lantana, camara, weed, across, the, islands, open, grasslands, it, also, has, been, recorded, as, the, fourth, ranking, avian, pest, in, the, fruit, industry, by, a, 2004, survey, of, the, hawaiian, farm, bureau, and, the, sixth, in, number, of, complaints, of, avian, pests, overall, common, mynas, can, cause, considerable, damage, to, ripening, fruit, particularly, grapes, but, also, figs, apples, pears, strawberries, blueberries, guava, mangoes, and, breadfruit, cereal, crops, such, as, maize, wheat, and, rice, are, susceptible, where, they, occur, near, urban, areas, roosting, and, nesting, commensal, with, humans, create, aesthetic, and, health, concerns, common, mynas, are, known, to, carry, avian, malaria, and, exotic, parasites, such, as, the, ornithonyssus, bursia, mite, which, can, cause, dermatitis, in, humans, the, common, myna, can, help, spread, agricultural, weeds, for, example, it, spreads, the, seeds, of, lantana, camara, which, has, been, classed, as, a, weed, of, national, significance, because, of, its, invasiveness, common, mynas, are, regularly, observed, to, usurp, nests, and, hollows, destroy, the, eggs, and, kill, the, young, of, native, bird, species, including, seabirds, and, parrots, there, is, evidence, that, common, mynas, have, killed, small, land, mammals, such, as, mice, squirrels, and, possums, but, further, research, on, these, occurrences, is, under, consideration, the, common, myna, being, a, major, agricultural, pest, and, posing, a, threat, to, native, species, in, non, native, countries, is, controlled, by, various, factors, mynas, are, either, killed, or, chased, away, as, control, poison, shooting, cage, traps, and, bird, scaring, devices, are, currently, used, for, control, in, sanskrit, literature, the, common, myna, has, a, number, of, names, most, are, descriptive, of, the, appearance, or, behaviour, of, the, bird, in, addition, to, saarika, the, names, for, the, common, myna, include, kalahapriya, which, means, one, who, is, fond, of, arguments, referring, to, the, quarrelsome, nature, of, this, bird, chitranetra, meaning, picturesque, eyes, peetanetra, one, with, yellow, eyes, and, peetapaad, one, with, yellow, legs, the, bird, called, rik, sanskrit, seems, to, refer, to, the, common, myna, though, there, are, other, candidates
