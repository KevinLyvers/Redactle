phasianus, hoazin, m, ller, 1776, the, hoatzin, h, o, t, s, n, hoh, at, sin, or, hoactzin, h, o, k, t, s, n, hoh, akt, sin, opisthocomus, hoazin, is, a, species, of, tropical, bird, found, in, swamps, riparian, forests, and, mangroves, of, the, amazon, and, the, orinoco, basins, in, south, america, it, is, the, only, extant, species, in, the, genus, opisthocomus, which, is, the, only, extant, genus, in, the, opisthocomidae, family, under, the, order, of, opisthocomiformes, despite, being, the, subject, of, intense, debate, by, specialists, the, taxonomic, position, of, this, family, is, still, far, from, clear, the, hoatzin, is, notable, for, its, chicks, having, primitive, claws, on, two, of, their, wing, digits, the, species, also, is, unique, in, possessing, a, digestive, system, capable, of, fermentation, and, the, effective, breaking, down, of, plant, matter, a, trait, more, commonly, known, from, herbivorous, ungulate, ruminant, mammals, and, some, primates, this, bird, is, also, the, national, bird, of, guyana, where, the, local, name, for, this, bird, is, canje, pheasant, the, hoatzin, is, pheasant, sized, with, a, total, length, of, 65, cm, 26, in, and, a, long, neck, and, small, head, it, has, an, unfeathered, blue, face, with, maroon, eyes, and, its, head, is, topped, by, a, spiky, rufous, crest, the, long, sooty, brown, tail, is, bronze, green, tipped, with, a, broad, whitish, or, buff, band, at, the, end, the, upper, parts, are, dark, sooty, brown, edged, buff, on, the, wing, coverts, and, streaked, buff, on, the, mantle, and, nape, the, underparts, are, buff, while, the, crissum, the, undertail, coverts, surrounding, the, cloaca, primaries, underwing, coverts, and, flanks, are, rich, rufous, chestnut, but, this, is, mainly, visible, when, the, hoatzin, opens, its, wings, it, is, a, noisy, bird, and, makes, a, variety, of, hoarse, calls, including, groans, croaks, hisses, and, grunts, these, calls, are, often, associated, with, body, movements, such, as, wing, spreading, hoatzin, chicks, have, two, claws, on, each, wing, immediately, after, hatching, they, can, use, these, claws, and, their, oversized, feet, to, scramble, around, the, tree, branches, without, falling, into, the, water, when, predators, such, as, the, great, black, hawk, attack, a, hoatzin, nesting, colony, the, adults, fly, noisily, about, trying, to, divert, the, predator, s, attention, while, the, chicks, move, away, from, the, nest, and, hide, among, the, thickets, if, discovered, however, they, drop, into, the, water, and, swim, under, the, surface, to, escape, then, later, use, their, clawed, wings, to, climb, back, to, the, safety, of, the, nest, this, has, inevitably, led, to, comparisons, to, the, fossil, bird, archaeopteryx, but, the, characteristic, is, rather, an, autapomorphy, possibly, caused, by, an, atavism, toward, the, dinosaurian, finger, claws, whose, developmental, genetics, blueprint, presumably, is, still, in, the, avian, genome, since, archaeopteryx, had, three, functional, claws, on, each, wing, some, earlier, systematists, speculated, that, the, hoatzin, was, descended, from, it, because, nestling, hoatzins, have, two, functional, claws, on, each, wing, modern, researchers, however, hypothesize, that, the, young, hoatzin, s, claws, are, of, more, recent, origin, and, may, be, a, secondary, adaptation, from, its, frequent, need, to, leave, the, nest, and, climb, about, in, dense, vines, and, trees, well, before, it, can, fly, a, similar, trait, is, seen, in, turacos, whose, nestlings, use, claws, on, their, wings, to, climb, in, trees, the, generic, name, opisthocomus, comes, from, ancient, greek, pisthokomos, derived, from, pisthe, pisthen, before, a, consonant, behind, and, k, m, hair, altogether, meaning, long, hair, behind, referring, to, its, large, crest, the, hoatzin, was, originally, described, in, 1776, by, german, zoologist, statius, m, ller, much, debate, has, occurred, about, the, hoatzin, s, relationships, with, other, birds, because, of, its, distinctness, it, has, been, given, its, own, family, the, opisthocomidae, and, its, own, suborder, the, opisthocomi, at, various, times, it, has, been, allied, with, such, taxa, as, the, tinamous, the, galliformes, gamebirds, the, rails, the, bustards, seriemas, sandgrouse, doves, turacos, and, other, cuculiformes, and, mousebirds, a, whole, genome, sequencing, study, published, in, 2014, places, the, hoatzin, as, the, sister, taxon, of, a, clade, composed, of, gruiformes, cranes, and, charadriiformes, plovers, another, genomic, study, in, 2024, instead, places, it, as, the, sister, group, to, the, phaethoquornithes, containing, numerous, aquatic, bird, orders, the, combined, group, was, found, to, be, sister, to, the, mirandornithes, flamingos, and, grebes, in, 2015, genetic, research, indicated, that, the, hoatzin, is, the, last, surviving, member, of, a, bird, line, that, branched, off, in, its, own, direction, 64, million, years, ago, shortly, after, the, extinction, event, that, killed, the, nonavian, dinosaurs, another, genetic, study, from, 2024, instead, suggested, a, late, cretaceous, origin, around, 70, million, years, ago, but, found, that, this, early, divergence, is, shared, with, a, majority, of, extant, bird, orders, making, it, no, more, primitive, than, them, with, respect, to, other, material, evidence, an, undisputed, fossil, record, of, a, close, hoatzin, relative, is, specimen, ucmp, 42823, a, single, cranium, backside, it, is, of, miocene, origin, and, was, recovered, in, the, upper, magdalena, river, valley, colombia, in, the, well, known, fauna, of, la, venta, this, has, been, placed, into, a, distinct, less, derived, genus, hoazinoides, but, clearly, would, be, placed, into, the, same, family, as, the, extant, species, it, markedly, differs, in, that, the, cranium, of, the, living, hoatzin, is, characteristic, being, much, domed, rounded, and, shortened, and, that, these, autapomorphies, were, less, pronounced, in, the, miocene, bird, m, ller, discussed, these, findings, in, the, light, of, the, supposed, affiliation, of, the, hoatzins, and, the, galliformes, which, was, the, favored, hypothesis, at, that, time, but, had, been, controversial, almost, since, its, inception, he, cautioned, however, that, hoazinoides, by, no, means, establishes, a, phyletic, junction, point, with, other, galliforms, for, obvious, reasons, as, we, know, today, anything, other, than, the, primary, findings, of, m, ller, are, not, to, be, expected, in, any, case, as, by, the, time, of, hoazinoides, essentially, all, modern, bird, families, are, either, known, or, believed, to, have, been, present, and, distinct, going, further, back, in, time, the, late, eocene, or, early, oligocene, some, 34, mya, filholornis, from, france, has, also, been, considered, proof, of, a, link, between, the, hoatzin, and, the, gamebirds, the, fragmentary, fossil, onychopteryx, from, the, eocene, of, argentina, and, the, quite, complete, but, no, less, enigmatic, early, middle, eocene, ypresian, lutetian, some, 48, mya, foro, panarium, are, sometimes, used, to, argue, for, a, hoatzin, cuculiform, including, turacos, link, as, demonstrated, above, though, this, must, be, considered, highly, speculative, if, not, as, badly, off, the, mark, as, the, relationship, with, the, cracidae, discussed, by, miller, the, earliest, record, of, the, order, opisthocomiformes, is, protoazin, parisiensis, from, the, latest, eocene, about, 34, mya, of, romainville, france, the, holotype, and, only, known, specimen, is, nmb, pg, 70, consisting, of, partial, coracoid, partial, scapula, and, partial, pedal, phalanx, according, to, the, phylogenetic, analysis, performed, by, the, authors, namibiavis, although, later, is, more, basal, than, protoazin, opisthocomiforms, seem, to, have, been, much, more, widespread, in, the, past, with, the, present, south, american, distribution, being, only, a, relic, by, the, early, to, middle, miocene, they, were, probably, extinct, in, europe, already, as, formations, dated, to, this, time, and, representing, fluvial, or, lacustrine, palaeoenvironments, in, which, the, hoatzin, thrives, today, have, yielded, dozens, of, bird, specimens, but, no, opisthocomiforms, a, possible, explanation, to, account, for, the, extinction, of, protoazin, between, the, late, eocene, and, the, early, miocene, in, europe, and, of, namibiavis, after, the, middle, miocene, of, sub, saharan, africa, is, the, arrival, of, arboreal, carnivorans, predation, which, could, have, had, a, devastating, effect, on, the, local, opisthocomiforms, if, they, were, similarly, poor, flyers, and, had, a, similarly, vulnerable, nesting, strategies, as, today, s, hoatzins, felids, and, viverrids, first, arrived, in, europe, from, asia, after, the, turgai, sea, closed, marking, the, boundary, between, the, eocene, and, the, oligocene, none, of, these, predators, and, for, the, matter, no, placental, predator, at, all, was, present, in, south, america, before, the, great, american, interchange, 3, mya, this, absence, could, explain, the, survival, of, the, hoatzin, there, in, addition, to, being, the, earliest, fossil, record, of, an, opisthocomiform, protoazin, was, also, the, earliest, find, of, one, 1912, but, it, was, forgotten, for, more, than, a, century, being, described, only, in, 2014, hoazinavis, is, an, extinct, genus, of, early, opisthocomiforms, from, late, oligocene, and, early, miocene, about, 24, 22, mya, deposits, of, brazil, it, was, collected, in, 2008, from, the, trememb, formation, of, s, o, paulo, brazil, it, was, first, named, by, gerald, mayr, herculano, alvarenga, and, c, cile, mourer, chauvir, in, 2011, and, the, type, species, is, hoazinavis, lacustris, namibiavis, is, another, extinct, genus, of, early, opisthocomiforms, from, early, middle, miocene, around, 16, mya, deposits, of, namibia, it, was, collected, from, arrisdrift, southern, namibia, it, was, first, named, by, c, cile, mourer, chauvir, in, 2003, and, the, type, species, is, namibiavis, senutae, the, hoatzin, is, a, folivore, it, eats, the, leaves, and, to, a, lesser, degree, the, fruits, and, flowers, of, the, plants, that, grow, in, its, marshy, and, riverine, habitat, it, clambers, around, along, the, branches, in, its, search, for, food, the, hoatzin, uses, a, leathery, bump, on, the, bottom, of, its, crop, to, help, balance, its, weight, on, the, branches, the, species, was, once, thought, to, eat, the, leaves, of, only, arums, and, mangroves, but, the, species, is, now, known, to, consume, the, leaves, of, more, than, 50, botanical, species, one, study, undertaken, in, venezuela, found, that, the, hoatzin, s, diet, was, 82, leaves, 10, flowers, and, 8, fruit, any, feeding, on, insects, or, other, animal, matter, is, purely, opportunistic, or, accidental, one, of, this, species, many, peculiarities, is, its, unique, digestive, system, which, contains, specialized, bacteria, in, the, front, part, of, the, gut, that, break, down, and, ferment, the, foliar, material, they, consume, much, like, cattle, and, other, ruminants, do, this, process, is, more, efficient, than, what, has, been, measured, in, many, other, species, of, birds, with, up, to, 70, of, the, plant, fiber, being, digested, unlike, ruminants, however, which, possess, a, rumen, a, specialized, chambered, stomach, for, bacterial, fermentation, the, hoatzin, has, an, unusually, large, crop, that, is, folded, into, two, chambers, with, a, large, multi, chambered, lower, esophagus, serrations, on, the, beak, help, cut, leaves, into, smaller, pieces, before, they, are, swallowed, because, they, lack, the, teeth, of, mammals, hoatzins, don, t, regurgitate, their, food, or, chew, the, cud, instead, a, combination, of, muscular, pressure, and, abrasion, by, a, cornified, lining, of, the, crop, is, used, as, an, equivalent, to, remastication, allowing, fermentation, and, trituration, to, occur, at, the, same, site, the, fermented, foliage, produces, methane, which, the, bird, expels, through, burping, its, stomach, chamber, and, gizzard, are, much, smaller, than, in, other, birds, its, crop, is, so, large, as, to, displace, the, flight, muscles, and, keel, of, the, sternum, much, to, the, detriment, of, its, flight, capacity, the, crop, is, supported, by, a, thickened, skin, callus, on, the, tip, of, the, sternum, which, helps, the, bird, support, the, crop, on, a, branch, during, rest, and, while, digesting, its, food, a, hoatzin, s, meal, takes, up, to, 45, hours, to, pass, through, its, body, with, a, body, weight, as, low, as, 700, grams, 1, 5, lb, the, adult, hoatzin, is, the, smallest, known, animal, with, foregut, fermentation, the, lower, limit, for, mammals, is, about, 3, kilograms, or, 6, 6, pounds, because, of, aromatic, compounds, in, the, leaves, they, consume, and, the, bacterial, fermentation, required, to, digest, them, the, birds, have, a, disagreeable, manure, like, odor, and, are, only, hunted, by, humans, for, food, in, times, of, dire, need, local, people, also, call, it, the, stinkbird, because, of, it, much, of, the, hoatzin, s, diet, including, various, types, of, monstera, philodendron, and, other, aroids, contains, a, high, concentration, of, calcium, oxalate, crystals, which, even, in, small, amounts, can, be, greatly, uncomfortable, and, even, dangerous, for, humans, to, consume, hoatzins, are, seasonal, breeders, breeding, during, the, rainy, season, the, exact, timing, of, which, varies, across, their, range, hoatzins, are, gregarious, and, nest, in, small, colonies, laying, two, or, three, eggs, in, a, stick, nest, in, a, tree, hanging, over, water, in, seasonally, flooded, forests, the, chicks, are, fed, on, regurgitated, fermented, food, in, brazil, indigenous, peoples, sometimes, collect, the, eggs, for, food, and, the, adults, are, occasionally, hunted, but, it, is, generally, rare, to, consume, mature, birds, as, hoatzin, meat, is, reputed, to, have, a, bad, taste, its, preferred, habitats, of, forests, and, inland, wetlands, are, threatened, by, amazonian, deforestation, the, hoatzin, is, believed, to, remain, fairly, common, in, a, large, part, of, its, range, but, its, population, is, likely, decreasing, due, to, habitat, loss, the, hoatzin, is, the, national, bird, of, guyana
