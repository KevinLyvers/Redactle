lobsters, are, malacostracans, of, the, family, nephropidae, or, its, synonym, homaridae, they, have, long, bodies, with, muscular, tails, and, live, in, crevices, or, burrows, on, the, sea, floor, three, of, their, five, pairs, of, legs, have, claws, including, the, first, pair, which, are, usually, much, larger, than, the, others, highly, prized, as, seafood, lobsters, are, economically, important, and, are, often, one, of, the, most, profitable, commodities, in, the, coastal, areas, they, populate, commercially, important, species, include, two, species, of, homarus, from, the, northern, atlantic, ocean, and, scampi, which, look, more, like, a, shrimp, or, a, mini, lobster, the, northern, hemisphere, genus, nephrops, and, the, southern, hemisphere, genus, metanephrops, although, several, other, groups, of, crustaceans, have, the, word, lobster, in, their, names, the, unqualified, term, lobster, generally, refers, to, the, clawed, lobsters, of, the, family, nephropidae, clawed, lobsters, are, not, closely, related, to, spiny, lobsters, or, slipper, lobsters, which, have, no, claws, chelae, or, to, squat, lobsters, the, most, similar, living, relatives, of, clawed, lobsters, are, the, reef, lobsters, and, the, three, families, of, freshwater, crayfish, lobsters, are, invertebrates, with, a, hard, protective, exoskeleton, like, most, arthropods, lobsters, must, shed, to, grow, which, leaves, them, vulnerable, during, the, shedding, process, several, species, change, color, lobsters, have, eight, walking, legs, the, front, three, pairs, bear, claws, the, first, of, which, are, larger, than, the, others, the, front, pincers, are, also, biologically, considered, legs, so, they, belong, in, the, order, decapods, ten, footed, although, lobsters, are, largely, bilaterally, symmetrical, like, most, other, arthropods, some, genera, possess, unequal, specialized, claws, lobster, anatomy, includes, two, main, body, parts, the, cephalothorax, and, the, abdomen, the, cephalothorax, fuses, the, head, and, the, thorax, both, of, which, are, covered, by, a, chitinous, carapace, the, lobster, s, head, bears, antennae, antennules, mandibles, the, first, and, second, maxillae, the, head, also, bears, the, usually, stalked, compound, eyes, because, lobsters, live, in, murky, environments, at, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, they, mostly, use, their, antennae, as, sensors, the, lobster, eye, has, a, reflective, structure, above, a, convex, retina, in, contrast, most, complex, eyes, use, refractive, ray, concentrators, lenses, and, a, concave, retina, the, lobster, s, thorax, is, composed, of, maxillipeds, appendages, that, function, primarily, as, mouthparts, and, pereiopods, appendages, that, serve, for, walking, and, for, gathering, food, the, abdomen, includes, pleopods, also, known, as, swimmerets, used, for, swimming, as, well, as, the, tail, fan, composed, of, uropods, and, the, telson, lobsters, like, snails, and, spiders, have, blue, blood, due, to, the, presence, of, hemocyanin, which, contains, copper, in, contrast, vertebrates, and, many, other, animals, have, red, blood, from, iron, rich, hemoglobin, lobsters, possess, a, green, hepatopancreas, called, the, tomalley, by, chefs, which, functions, as, the, animal, s, liver, and, pancreas, lobsters, of, the, family, nephropidae, are, similar, in, overall, form, to, several, other, related, groups, they, differ, from, freshwater, crayfish, in, lacking, the, joint, between, the, last, two, segments, of, the, thorax, and, they, differ, from, the, reef, lobsters, of, the, family, enoplometopidae, in, having, full, claws, on, the, first, three, pairs, of, legs, rather, than, just, one, the, distinctions, from, fossil, families, such, as, the, chilenophoberidae, are, based, on, the, pattern, of, grooves, on, the, carapace, analysis, of, the, neural, gene, complement, revealed, extraordinary, development, of, the, chemosensory, machinery, including, a, profound, diversification, of, ligand, gated, ion, channels, and, secretory, molecules, typically, lobsters, are, dark, colored, either, bluish, green, or, greenish, brown, to, blend, in, with, the, ocean, floor, but, they, can, be, found, in, many, colors, lobsters, with, atypical, coloring, are, extremely, rare, accounting, for, only, a, few, of, the, millions, caught, every, year, and, due, to, their, rarity, they, usually, are, not, eaten, instead, being, released, back, into, the, wild, or, donated, to, aquariums, often, in, cases, of, atypical, coloring, there, is, a, genetic, factor, such, as, albinism, or, hermaphroditism, special, coloring, does, not, appear, to, affect, the, lobster, s, taste, once, cooked, except, for, albinos, all, lobsters, possess, astaxanthin, which, is, responsible, for, the, bright, red, color, lobsters, turn, after, being, cooked, lobsters, live, up, to, an, estimated, 45, to, 50, years, in, the, wild, although, determining, age, is, difficult, it, is, typically, estimated, from, size, and, other, variables, newer, techniques, may, lead, to, more, accurate, age, estimates, research, suggests, that, lobsters, may, not, slow, down, weaken, or, lose, fertility, with, age, and, that, older, lobsters, may, be, more, fertile, than, younger, lobsters, this, longevity, may, be, due, to, telomerase, an, enzyme, that, repairs, long, repetitive, sections, of, dna, sequences, at, the, ends, of, chromosomes, referred, to, as, telomeres, telomerase, is, expressed, by, most, vertebrates, during, embryonic, stages, but, is, generally, absent, from, adult, stages, of, life, however, unlike, most, vertebrates, lobsters, express, telomerase, as, adults, through, most, tissue, which, has, been, suggested, to, be, related, to, their, longevity, telomerase, is, especially, present, in, green, spotted, lobsters, whose, markings, are, thought, to, be, produced, by, the, enzyme, interacting, with, their, shell, pigmentation, lobster, longevity, is, limited, by, their, size, moulting, requires, metabolic, energy, and, the, larger, the, lobster, the, more, energy, is, needed, 10, to, 15, of, lobsters, die, of, exhaustion, during, moulting, while, in, older, lobsters, moulting, ceases, and, the, exoskeleton, degrades, or, collapses, entirely, leading, to, death, like, many, decapod, crustaceans, lobsters, grow, throughout, life, and, can, add, new, muscle, cells, at, each, moult, lobster, longevity, allows, them, to, reach, impressive, sizes, according, to, guinness, world, records, the, largest, lobster, ever, caught, was, in, nova, scotia, canada, weighing, 20, 15, kilograms, 44, 4, lb, lobsters, live, in, all, oceans, on, rocky, sandy, or, muddy, bottoms, from, the, shoreline, to, beyond, the, edge, of, the, continental, shelf, contingent, largely, on, size, and, age, smaller, younger, lobsters, are, typically, found, in, crevices, or, in, burrows, under, rocks, and, do, not, typically, migrate, larger, older, lobsters, are, more, likely, to, be, found, in, deeper, seas, migrating, back, to, shallow, waters, seasonally, lobsters, are, omnivores, and, typically, eat, live, prey, such, as, fish, mollusks, other, crustaceans, worms, and, some, plant, life, they, scavenge, if, necessary, and, are, known, to, resort, to, cannibalism, in, captivity, however, when, lobster, skin, is, found, in, lobster, stomachs, this, is, not, necessarily, evidence, of, cannibalism, because, lobsters, eat, their, shed, skin, after, moulting, while, cannibalism, was, thought, to, be, nonexistent, among, wild, lobster, populations, it, was, observed, in, 2012, by, researchers, studying, wild, lobsters, in, maine, these, first, known, instances, of, lobster, cannibalism, in, the, wild, are, theorized, to, be, attributed, to, a, local, population, explosion, among, lobsters, caused, by, the, disappearance, of, many, of, the, maine, lobsters, natural, predators, in, general, lobsters, are, 25, 50, cm, 10, 20, in, long, and, move, by, slowly, walking, on, the, sea, floor, however, they, swim, backward, quickly, when, they, flee, by, curling, and, uncurling, their, abdomens, a, speed, of, 5, m, s, 11, mph, has, been, recorded, this, is, known, as, the, caridoid, escape, reaction, symbiotic, animals, of, the, genus, symbion, the, only, known, member, of, the, phylum, cycliophora, live, exclusively, on, lobster, gills, and, mouthparts, different, species, of, symbion, have, been, found, on, the, three, commercially, important, lobsters, of, the, north, atlantic, ocean, nephrops, norvegicus, homarus, gammarus, and, homarus, americanus, lobster, is, commonly, served, boiled, or, steamed, in, the, shell, diners, crack, the, shell, with, lobster, crackers, and, fish, out, the, meat, with, lobster, picks, the, meat, is, often, eaten, with, melted, butter, and, lemon, juice, lobster, is, also, used, in, soup, bisque, lobster, rolls, cappon, magro, and, dishes, such, as, lobster, newberg, and, lobster, thermidor, cooks, boil, or, steam, live, lobsters, when, a, lobster, is, cooked, its, shell, s, color, changes, from, brown, to, orange, because, the, heat, from, cooking, breaks, down, a, protein, called, crustacyanin, which, suppresses, the, orange, hue, of, the, chemical, astaxanthin, which, is, also, found, in, the, shell, according, to, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, fda, the, mean, level, of, mercury, in, american, lobster, between, 2005, and, 2007, was, 0, 107, ppm, humans, are, claimed, to, have, eaten, lobster, since, early, history, large, piles, of, lobster, shells, near, areas, populated, by, fishing, communities, attest, to, the, crustacean, s, extreme, popularity, during, this, period, evidence, indicates, that, lobster, was, being, consumed, as, a, regular, food, product, in, fishing, communities, along, the, shores, of, britain, south, africa, australia, and, papua, new, guinea, years, ago, lobster, became, a, significant, source, of, nutrients, among, european, coastal, dwellers, historians, suggest, lobster, was, an, important, secondary, food, source, for, most, european, coastal, dwellers, and, it, was, a, primary, food, source, for, coastal, communities, in, britain, during, this, time, lobster, became, a, popular, mid, range, delicacy, during, the, mid, to, late, roman, period, the, price, of, lobster, could, vary, widely, due, to, various, factors, but, evidence, indicates, that, lobster, was, regularly, transported, inland, over, long, distances, to, meet, popular, demand, a, mosaic, found, in, the, ruins, of, pompeii, suggests, that, the, spiny, lobster, was, of, considerable, interest, to, the, roman, population, during, the, early, imperial, period, lobster, was, a, popular, food, among, the, moche, people, of, peru, between, 50, ce, and, 800, ce, besides, its, use, as, food, lobster, shells, were, also, used, to, create, a, light, pink, dye, ornaments, and, tools, a, mass, produced, lobster, shaped, effigy, vessel, dated, to, this, period, attests, to, lobster, s, popularity, at, this, time, though, the, purpose, of, this, vessel, has, not, been, identified, the, viking, period, saw, an, increase, in, lobster, and, other, shellfish, consumption, among, northern, europeans, this, can, be, attributed, to, the, overall, increase, in, marine, activity, due, to, the, development, of, better, boats, and, the, increasing, cultural, investment, in, building, ships, and, training, sailors, the, consumption, of, marine, life, went, up, overall, in, this, period, and, the, consumption, of, lobster, went, up, in, accordance, with, this, general, trend, unlike, fish, however, lobster, had, to, be, cooked, within, two, days, of, leaving, salt, water, limiting, the, availability, of, lobster, to, inland, dwellers, thus, lobster, more, than, fish, became, a, food, primarily, available, to, the, relatively, well, off, at, least, among, non, coastal, dwellers, lobster, is, first, mentioned, in, cookbooks, during, the, medieval, period, le, viandier, de, taillevent, a, french, recipe, collection, written, around, 1300, suggests, that, lobster, also, called, saltwater, crayfish, be, cooked, in, wine, and, water, or, in, the, oven, eaten, in, vinegar, le, viandier, de, taillevent, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, first, haute, cuisine, cookbooks, advising, on, how, to, cook, meals, that, would, have, been, quite, elaborate, for, the, period, and, making, usage, of, expensive, and, hard, to, obtain, ingredients, though, the, original, edition, which, includes, the, recipe, for, lobster, was, published, before, the, birth, of, french, court, cook, guillaume, tirel, tirel, later, expanded, and, republished, this, recipe, collection, suggesting, that, the, recipes, included, in, both, editions, were, popular, among, the, highest, circles, of, french, nobility, including, king, philip, vi, the, inclusion, of, a, lobster, recipe, in, this, cookbook, especially, one, which, does, not, make, use, of, other, more, expensive, ingredients, attests, to, the, popularity, of, lobster, among, the, wealthy, the, french, household, guidebook, le, m, nagier, de, paris, published, in, 1393, includes, no, less, than, five, recipes, including, lobster, which, vary, in, elaboration, a, guidebook, intended, to, provide, advice, for, women, running, upper, class, households, le, m, nagier, de, paris, is, similar, to, its, predecessor, in, that, it, indicates, the, popularity, of, lobster, as, a, food, among, the, upper, classes, that, lobster, was, first, mentioned, in, cookbooks, during, the, 1300s, and, only, mentioned, in, two, during, this, century, should, not, be, taken, as, an, implication, that, lobster, was, not, widely, consumed, before, or, during, this, time, recipe, collections, were, virtually, non, existent, before, the, 1300s, and, only, a, handful, exist, from, the, medieval, period, during, the, early, 1400s, lobster, was, still, a, popular, dish, among, the, upper, classes, during, this, time, influential, households, used, the, variety, and, variation, of, species, served, at, feasts, to, display, wealth, and, prestige, lobster, was, commonly, found, among, these, spreads, indicating, that, it, continued, to, be, held, in, high, esteem, among, the, wealthy, in, one, notable, instance, the, bishop, of, salisbury, offered, at, least, 42, kinds, of, crustaceans, and, fish, at, his, feasts, over, nine, months, including, several, varieties, of, lobster, however, lobster, was, not, a, food, exclusively, accessed, by, the, wealthy, the, general, population, living, on, the, coasts, made, use, of, the, various, food, sources, provided, by, the, ocean, and, shellfish, especially, became, a, more, popular, source, of, nutrition, among, the, general, population, lobster, was, generally, eaten, boiled, during, the, mid, 15th, century, but, the, influence, of, the, cuisine, of, higher, society, can, be, seen, in, that, it, was, now, also, regularly, eaten, cold, with, vinegar, the, inland, peasantry, would, still, have, generally, been, unfamiliar, with, lobster, during, this, time, lobster, continued, to, be, eaten, as, a, delicacy, and, a, general, staple, food, among, coastal, communities, until, the, late, 17th, century, during, this, time, the, influence, of, the, church, and, the, government, regulating, and, sometimes, banning, meat, consumption, during, certain, periods, continued, to, encourage, the, popularity, of, seafood, especially, shellfish, as, a, meat, alternative, among, all, classes, throughout, this, period, lobster, was, eaten, fresh, pickled, and, salted, from, the, late, 17th, century, onward, developments, in, fishing, transportation, and, cooking, technology, allowed, lobster, to, more, easily, make, its, way, inland, and, the, variety, of, dishes, involving, lobster, and, cooking, techniques, used, with, the, ingredient, expanded, however, these, developments, coincided, with, a, decrease, in, the, lobster, population, and, lobster, increasingly, became, a, delicacy, food, valued, among, the, rich, as, a, status, symbol, and, less, likely, to, be, found, in, the, diet, of, the, general, population, the, american, lobster, was, not, originally, popular, among, european, colonists, in, north, america, this, was, partially, due, to, the, european, inlander, s, association, of, lobster, with, barely, edible, salted, seafood, and, partially, due, to, a, cultural, opinion, that, seafood, was, a, lesser, alternative, to, meat, that, did, not, provide, the, taste, or, nutrients, desired, it, was, also, due, to, the, extreme, abundance, of, lobster, at, the, time, of, the, colonists, arrival, which, contributed, to, a, general, perception, of, lobster, as, an, undesirable, peasant, food, the, american, lobster, did, not, achieve, popularity, until, the, mid, 19th, century, when, new, yorkers, and, bostonians, developed, a, taste, for, it, and, commercial, lobster, fisheries, only, flourished, after, the, development, of, the, lobster, smack, a, custom, made, boat, with, open, holding, wells, on, the, deck, to, keep, the, lobsters, alive, during, transport, before, this, time, lobster, was, considered, a, poverty, food, or, as, a, food, for, indentured, servants, or, lower, members, of, society, in, maine, massachusetts, and, the, canadian, maritimes, some, servants, specified, in, employment, agreements, that, they, would, not, eat, lobster, more, than, twice, per, week, however, there, is, limited, evidence, for, this, lobster, was, also, commonly, served, in, prisons, much, to, the, displeasure, of, inmates, american, lobster, was, initially, deemed, worthy, only, of, being, used, as, fertilizer, or, fish, bait, and, until, well, into, the, 20th, century, it, was, not, viewed, as, more, than, a, low, priced, canned, staple, food, as, a, crustacean, lobster, remains, a, taboo, food, in, the, dietary, laws, of, judaism, and, certain, streams, of, islam, caught, lobsters, are, graded, as, new, shell, hard, shell, or, old, shell, because, lobsters, that, have, recently, shed, their, shells, are, the, most, delicate, an, inverse, relationship, exists, between, the, price, of, american, lobster, and, its, flavor, new, shell, lobsters, have, paper, thin, shells, and, a, worse, meat, to, shell, ratio, but, the, meat, is, very, sweet, however, the, lobsters, are, so, delicate, that, even, transport, to, boston, almost, kills, them, making, the, market, for, new, shell, lobsters, strictly, local, to, the, fishing, towns, where, they, are, offloaded, hard, shell, lobsters, with, firm, shells, but, less, sweet, meat, can, survive, shipping, to, boston, new, york, and, even, los, angeles, so, they, command, a, higher, price, than, new, shell, lobsters, meanwhile, old, shell, lobsters, which, have, not, shed, since, the, previous, season, and, have, a, coarser, flavor, can, be, air, shipped, anywhere, in, the, world, and, arrive, alive, making, them, the, most, expensive, several, methods, are, used, for, killing, lobsters, the, most, common, way, of, killing, lobsters, is, by, placing, them, live, in, boiling, water, sometimes, after, being, placed, in, a, freezer, for, a, period, another, method, is, to, split, the, lobster, or, sever, the, body, in, half, lengthwise, lobsters, may, also, be, killed, or, immobilized, immediately, before, boiling, by, a, stab, into, the, brain, pithing, in, the, belief, that, this, will, stop, suffering, however, a, lobster, s, brain, operates, from, not, one, but, several, ganglia, and, disabling, only, the, frontal, ganglion, does, not, usually, result, in, death, the, boiling, method, is, illegal, in, some, places, such, as, in, italy, where, offenders, face, fines, up, to, 495, lobsters, can, be, killed, by, electrocution, prior, to, cooking, with, a, device, called, the, crustastun, since, march, 2018, lobsters, in, switzerland, need, to, be, knocked, out, or, killed, instantly, before, they, are, boiled, they, also, receive, other, forms, of, protection, while, in, transit, lobsters, are, caught, using, baited, one, way, traps, with, a, color, coded, marker, buoy, to, mark, cages, lobster, is, fished, in, water, between, 2, and, 900, metres, 1, and, 500, fathoms, although, some, lobsters, live, at, 3, 700, metres, 2, 000, fathoms, cages, are, of, plastic, coated, galvanized, steel, or, wood, a, lobster, fisher, may, tend, to, as, many, as, 2, 000, traps, around, the, year, 2000, owing, to, overfishing, and, high, demand, lobster, aquaculture, expanded, the, fossil, record, of, clawed, lobsters, extends, back, at, least, to, the, valanginian, age, of, the, cretaceous, 140, million, years, ago, this, list, contains, all, 54, extant, species, in, the, family, nephropidae
