a, penis, p, i, n, s, pl, penises, or, penes, is, a, male, sex, organ, that, is, used, to, inseminate, female, or, hermaphrodite, animals, during, copulation, such, organs, occur, in, both, vertebrates, and, invertebrates, but, not, in, all, male, animals, the, term, penis, applies, to, many, intromittent, organs, but, not, to, all, as, an, example, the, intromittent, organ, of, most, cephalopoda, is, the, hectocotylus, a, specialized, arm, and, male, spiders, use, their, pedipalps, even, within, the, vertebrata, there, are, morphological, variants, with, specific, terminology, such, as, hemipenes, the, word, penis, is, taken, from, the, latin, word, for, tail, some, derive, that, from, indo, european, pesnis, and, the, greek, word, penis, from, indo, european, pesos, prior, to, the, adoption, of, the, latin, word, in, english, the, penis, was, referred, to, as, a, yard, the, oxford, english, dictionary, cites, an, example, of, the, word, yard, used, in, this, sense, from, 1379, and, notes, that, in, his, physical, dictionary, of, 1684, steven, blankaart, defined, the, word, penis, as, the, yard, made, up, of, two, nervous, bodies, the, channel, nut, skin, and, fore, skin, etc, according, to, wiktionary, this, term, meant, among, other, senses, rod, or, bar, as, with, nearly, any, aspect, of, the, body, involved, in, sexual, or, excretory, functions, the, penis, is, the, subject, of, many, slang, words, and, euphemisms, for, it, a, particularly, common, and, enduring, one, being, cock, see, wikisaurus, penis, for, a, list, of, alternative, words, for, penis, the, latin, word, phallus, from, greek, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, the, penis, although, phallus, originally, was, used, to, describe, representations, pictorial, or, carved, of, the, penis, the, external, genital, organs, appeared, in, the, devonian, about, 410, million, years, ago, when, tetrapods, began, to, abandon, the, aquatic, environment, in, fact, the, necessity, to, overcome, the, absence, of, a, liquid, phase, in, which, to, release, the, gametes, was, achieved, through, the, transition, to, internal, fertilization, among, amniotes, the, development, of, an, erectile, penis, occurred, independently, for, mammals, squamates, lizards, and, snakes, testudines, turtles, and, archosaurs, crocodiles, and, birds, over, time, birds, have, lost, this, organ, with, the, exception, of, paleognathae, and, anseriformes, the, penis, is, an, intromittent, organ, used, to, transfer, sperm, into, the, female, genital, tract, i, e, vagina, or, cloaca, for, potential, fertilization, and, in, the, case, of, placentals, also, for, the, excretion, of, urine, the, penises, of, different, animal, groups, are, not, homologous, with, each, other, but, were, created, several, times, independently, of, each, other, in, the, course, of, evolution, an, erection, is, the, stiffening, and, rising, of, the, penis, which, occurs, during, sexual, arousal, though, it, can, also, happen, in, non, sexual, situations, during, ejaculation, a, series, of, muscular, contractions, delivers, semen, containing, male, gametes, known, as, sperm, cells, or, spermatozoa, from, the, penis, ejaculation, is, usually, accompanied, by, orgasm, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, living, amniotes, mammals, birds, and, reptiles, likely, possessed, a, penis, most, male, birds, e, g, roosters, and, turkeys, have, a, cloaca, also, present, on, the, female, but, not, a, penis, among, bird, species, with, a, penis, are, paleognaths, tinamous, and, ratites, and, anatidae, ducks, geese, and, swans, the, magpie, goose, in, the, family, anseranatidae, also, has, a, penis, a, bird, penis, is, different, in, structure, from, mammal, penises, being, an, erectile, expansion, of, the, cloacal, wall, in, ducks, and, being, erected, by, lymph, not, blood, it, is, usually, partially, feathered, and, in, some, species, features, spines, and, brush, like, filaments, and, in, a, flaccid, state, curls, up, inside, the, cloaca, as, with, any, other, bodily, attribute, the, length, and, girth, of, the, penis, can, be, highly, variable, between, mammals, of, different, species, in, many, mammals, the, penis, is, retracted, into, a, prepuce, when, not, erect, mammals, have, either, musculocavernous, penises, which, expand, while, erect, or, fibroelastic, penises, which, become, erect, by, straightening, without, expanding, preputial, glands, are, present, in, some, prepuces, the, penis, bears, distal, part, of, the, urethra, in, placental, mammals, the, perineum, of, testicond, mammals, mammals, without, a, scrotum, separates, the, anus, and, the, penis, a, bone, called, the, baculum, is, present, in, most, placentals, but, absent, in, humans, cattle, and, horses, in, mammals, the, penis, is, divided, into, three, parts, the, internal, structures, of, the, penis, consist, mainly, of, cavernous, erectile, tissue, which, is, a, collection, of, blood, sinusoids, separated, by, sheets, of, connective, tissue, trabeculae, canine, penises, have, a, structure, at, the, base, called, the, bulbus, glandis, during, copulation, the, spotted, hyena, inserts, his, penis, through, the, female, s, pseudo, penis, instead, of, directly, through, the, vagina, which, is, blocked, by, the, false, scrotum, the, pseudo, penis, and, pseudo, scrotum, which, are, actually, a, masculinized, vulva, closely, resemble, the, male, hyena, s, genitalia, but, can, be, distinguished, from, the, male, by, the, female, s, greater, thickness, and, more, rounded, glans, domestic, cats, have, barbed, penises, with, about, 120, 150, one, millimetre, long, backwards, pointing, spines, marsupials, usually, have, bifurcated, penises, that, are, retracted, into, a, preputial, sheath, in, the, male, s, urogenital, sinus, when, not, erect, monotremes, and, marsupial, moles, are, the, only, mammals, in, which, the, penis, is, located, inside, the, cloaca, male, turtles, and, crocodilians, have, a, penis, while, male, specimens, of, the, reptile, order, squamata, which, are, snakes, and, lizards, have, two, paired, organs, called, hemipenes, tuataras, must, use, their, cloacae, for, reproduction, due, to, evolutionary, convergence, turtle, and, mammal, penises, have, a, similar, structure, in, some, fish, the, gonopodium, andropodium, and, claspers, are, intromittent, organs, to, introduce, sperm, into, the, female, developed, from, modified, fins, harvestmen, are, the, only, male, arachnids, that, have, a, penis, in, male, insects, the, structure, analogous, to, a, penis, is, known, as, an, aedeagus, the, male, copulatory, organ, of, various, lower, invertebrate, animals, is, often, called, the, cirrus, in, 2010, entomologist, charles, linehard, described, a, new, genus, of, barkflies, called, neotrogla, species, of, this, genus, have, sex, reversed, genitalia, females, have, penis, like, organs, called, gynosomes, that, are, inserted, into, vagina, like, openings, of, males, during, mating, a, similar, female, structure, has, also, been, described, in, the, closely, related, afrotrogla, scientists, who, study, these, insects, have, occasionally, called, the, gynosome, a, female, penis, and, insisted, to, drop, the, definition, of, penis, as, the, male, copulatory, organ, motivations, for, using, the, term, female, penis, include, that, such, a, term, is, easier, to, understand, and, much, more, eye, catching, and, that, the, gynosome, have, analogous, features, with, male, penises, meanwhile, critics, have, argued, that, it, does, not, fit, the, intromittent, organ, definition, of, a, structure, that, enters, the, female, genital, tract, and, deposits, sperm, pizzles, are, represented, in, heraldry, where, the, adjective, pizzled, or, vilen, indicates, that, part, of, an, animate, charge, s, anatomy, especially, if, coloured, differently
