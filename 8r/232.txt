plant, reproduction, is, the, production, of, new, offspring, in, plants, which, can, be, accomplished, by, sexual, or, asexual, reproduction, sexual, reproduction, produces, offspring, by, the, fusion, of, gametes, resulting, in, offspring, genetically, different, from, either, parent, asexual, reproduction, produces, new, individuals, without, the, fusion, of, gametes, resulting, in, clonal, plants, that, are, genetically, identical, to, the, parent, plant, and, each, other, unless, mutations, occur, asexual, reproduction, does, not, involve, the, production, and, fusion, of, male, and, female, gametes, asexual, reproduction, may, occur, through, budding, fragmentation, spore, formation, regeneration, and, vegetative, propagation, asexual, reproduction, is, a, type, of, reproduction, where, the, offspring, comes, from, one, parent, only, thus, inheriting, the, characteristics, of, the, parent, asexual, reproduction, in, plants, occurs, in, two, fundamental, forms, vegetative, reproduction, and, agamospermy, vegetative, reproduction, involves, a, vegetative, piece, of, the, original, plant, producing, new, individuals, by, budding, tillering, etc, and, is, distinguished, from, apomixis, which, is, a, replacement, of, sexual, reproduction, and, in, some, cases, involves, seeds, apomixis, occurs, in, many, plant, species, such, as, dandelions, taraxacum, species, and, also, in, some, non, plant, organisms, for, apomixis, and, similar, processes, in, non, plant, organisms, see, parthenogenesis, natural, vegetative, reproduction, is, a, process, mostly, found, in, perennial, plants, and, typically, involves, structural, modifications, of, the, stem, or, roots, and, in, a, few, species, leaves, most, plant, species, that, employ, vegetative, reproduction, do, so, as, a, means, to, perennialize, the, plants, allowing, them, to, survive, from, one, season, to, the, next, and, often, facilitating, their, expansion, in, size, a, plant, that, persists, in, a, location, through, vegetative, reproduction, of, individuals, gives, rise, to, a, clonal, colony, a, single, ramet, or, apparent, individual, of, a, clonal, colony, is, genetically, identical, to, all, others, in, the, same, colony, the, distance, that, a, plant, can, move, during, vegetative, reproduction, is, limited, though, some, plants, can, produce, ramets, from, branching, rhizomes, or, stolons, that, cover, a, wide, area, often, in, only, a, few, growing, seasons, in, a, sense, this, process, is, not, one, of, reproduction, but, one, of, survival, and, expansion, of, biomass, of, the, individual, when, an, individual, organism, increases, in, size, via, cell, multiplication, and, remains, intact, the, process, is, called, vegetative, growth, however, in, vegetative, reproduction, the, new, plants, that, result, are, new, individuals, in, almost, every, respect, except, genetic, a, major, disadvantage, of, vegetative, reproduction, is, the, transmission, of, pathogens, from, parent, to, offspring, it, is, uncommon, for, pathogens, to, be, transmitted, from, the, plant, to, its, seeds, in, sexual, reproduction, or, in, apomixis, though, there, are, occasions, when, it, occurs, seeds, generated, by, apomixis, are, a, means, of, asexual, reproduction, involving, the, formation, and, dispersal, of, seeds, that, do, not, originate, from, the, fertilization, of, the, embryos, hawkweeds, hieracium, dandelions, taraxacum, some, species, of, citrus, and, kentucky, blue, grass, poa, pratensis, all, use, this, form, of, asexual, reproduction, pseudogamy, occurs, in, some, plants, that, have, apomictic, seeds, where, pollination, is, often, needed, to, initiate, embryo, growth, though, the, pollen, contributes, no, genetic, material, to, the, developing, offspring, other, forms, of, apomixis, occur, in, plants, also, including, the, generation, of, a, plantlet, in, replacement, of, a, seed, or, the, generation, of, bulbils, instead, of, flowers, where, new, cloned, individuals, are, produced, a, rhizome, is, a, modified, underground, stem, serving, as, an, organ, of, vegetative, reproduction, the, growing, tips, of, the, rhizome, can, separate, as, new, plants, e, g, polypody, iris, couch, grass, and, nettles, prostrate, aerial, stems, called, runners, or, stolons, are, important, vegetative, reproduction, organs, in, some, species, such, as, the, strawberry, numerous, grasses, and, some, ferns, adventitious, buds, form, on, roots, near, the, ground, surface, on, damaged, stems, as, on, the, stumps, of, cut, trees, or, on, old, roots, these, develop, into, above, ground, stems, and, leaves, a, form, of, budding, called, suckering, is, the, reproduction, or, regeneration, of, a, plant, by, shoots, that, arise, from, an, existing, root, system, species, that, characteristically, produce, suckers, include, elm, ulmus, 299, and, many, members, of, the, rose, family, such, as, rosa, 285, 296, kerria, 206, and, rubus, 258, bulbous, plants, such, as, onion, allium, cepa, hyacinths, narcissi, and, tulips, reproduce, vegetatively, by, dividing, their, underground, bulbs, into, more, bulbs, other, plants, like, potatoes, solanum, tuberosum, and, dahlias, reproduce, vegetatively, from, underground, tubers, gladioli, and, crocuses, reproduce, vegetatively, in, a, similar, way, with, corms, gemmae, are, single, cells, or, masses, of, cells, that, detach, from, plants, to, form, new, clonal, individuals, these, are, common, in, liverworts, and, mosses, and, in, the, gametophyte, generation, of, some, filmy, fern, they, are, also, present, in, some, club, mosses, such, as, huperzia, lucidula, they, are, also, found, in, some, higher, plants, such, as, species, of, drosera, the, most, common, form, of, plant, reproduction, used, by, people, is, seeds, but, a, number, of, asexual, methods, are, used, which, are, usually, enhancements, of, natural, processes, including, cutting, grafting, budding, layering, division, sectioning, of, rhizomes, roots, tubers, bulbs, stolons, tillers, etc, and, artificial, propagation, by, laboratory, tissue, cloning, asexual, methods, are, most, often, used, to, propagate, cultivars, with, individual, desirable, characteristics, that, do, not, come, true, from, seed, fruit, tree, propagation, is, frequently, performed, by, budding, or, grafting, desirable, cultivars, clones, onto, rootstocks, that, are, also, clones, propagated, by, stooling, in, horticulture, a, cutting, is, a, branch, that, has, been, cut, off, from, a, mother, plant, below, an, internode, and, then, rooted, often, with, the, help, of, a, rooting, liquid, or, powder, containing, hormones, when, a, full, root, has, formed, and, leaves, begin, to, sprout, anew, the, clone, is, a, self, sufficient, plant, genetically, identical, examples, include, cuttings, from, the, stems, of, blackberries, rubus, occidentalis, african, violets, saintpaulia, verbenas, verbena, to, produce, new, plants, a, related, use, of, cuttings, is, grafting, where, a, stem, or, bud, is, joined, onto, a, different, stem, nurseries, offer, for, sale, trees, with, grafted, stems, that, can, produce, four, or, more, varieties, of, related, fruits, including, apples, the, most, common, usage, of, grafting, is, the, propagation, of, cultivars, onto, already, rooted, plants, sometimes, the, rootstock, is, used, to, dwarf, the, plants, or, protect, them, from, root, damaging, pathogens, since, vegetatively, propagated, plants, are, clones, they, are, important, tools, in, plant, research, when, a, clone, is, grown, in, various, conditions, differences, in, growth, can, be, ascribed, to, environmental, effects, instead, of, genetic, differences, sexual, reproduction, involves, two, fundamental, processes, meiosis, which, rearranges, the, genes, and, reduces, the, number, of, chromosomes, and, fertilization, which, restores, the, chromosome, to, a, complete, diploid, number, in, between, these, two, processes, different, types, of, plants, and, algae, vary, but, many, of, them, including, all, land, plants, undergo, alternation, of, generations, with, two, different, multicellular, structures, phases, a, gametophyte, and, a, sporophyte, the, evolutionary, origin, and, adaptive, significance, of, sexual, reproduction, are, discussed, in, the, pages, evolution, of, sexual, reproduction, and, origin, and, function, of, meiosis, the, gametophyte, is, the, multicellular, structure, plant, that, is, haploid, containing, a, single, set, of, chromosomes, in, each, cell, the, gametophyte, produces, male, or, female, gametes, or, both, by, a, process, of, cell, division, called, mitosis, in, vascular, plants, with, separate, gametophytes, female, gametophytes, are, known, as, mega, gametophytes, mega, large, they, produce, the, large, egg, cells, and, the, male, gametophytes, are, called, micro, gametophytes, micro, small, they, produce, the, small, sperm, cells, the, fusion, of, male, and, female, gametes, fertilization, produces, a, diploid, zygote, which, develops, by, mitotic, cell, divisions, into, a, multicellular, sporophyte, the, mature, sporophyte, produces, spores, by, meiosis, sometimes, referred, to, as, reduction, division, because, the, chromosome, pairs, are, separated, once, again, to, form, single, sets, in, mosses, and, liverworts, the, gametophyte, is, relatively, large, and, the, sporophyte, is, a, much, smaller, structure, that, is, never, separated, from, the, gametophyte, in, ferns, gymnosperms, and, flowering, plants, angiosperms, the, gametophytes, are, relatively, small, and, the, sporophyte, is, much, larger, in, gymnosperms, and, flowering, plants, the, megagametophyte, is, contained, within, the, ovule, that, may, develop, into, a, seed, and, the, microgametophyte, is, contained, within, a, pollen, grain, unlike, animals, plants, are, immobile, and, cannot, seek, out, sexual, partners, for, reproduction, in, the, evolution, of, early, plants, abiotic, means, including, water, and, much, later, wind, transported, sperm, for, reproduction, the, first, plants, were, aquatic, as, described, in, the, page, evolutionary, history, of, plants, and, released, sperm, freely, into, the, water, to, be, carried, with, the, currents, primitive, land, plants, such, as, liverworts, and, mosses, had, motile, sperm, that, swam, in, a, thin, film, of, water, or, were, splashed, in, water, droplets, from, the, male, reproduction, organs, onto, the, female, organs, as, taller, and, more, complex, plants, evolved, modifications, in, the, alternation, of, generations, evolved, in, the, paleozoic, era, progymnosperms, reproduced, by, using, spores, dispersed, on, the, wind, the, seed, plants, including, seed, ferns, conifers, and, cordaites, which, were, all, gymnosperms, evolved, 350, million, years, ago, they, had, pollen, grains, that, contained, the, male, gametes, for, protection, of, the, sperm, during, the, process, of, transfer, from, the, male, to, female, parts, it, is, believed, that, insects, fed, on, the, pollen, and, plants, thus, evolved, to, use, insects, to, actively, carry, pollen, from, one, plant, to, the, next, seed, producing, plants, which, include, the, angiosperms, and, the, gymnosperms, have, a, heteromorphic, alternation, of, generations, with, large, sporophytes, containing, much, reduced, gametophytes, angiosperms, have, distinctive, reproductive, organs, called, flowers, with, carpels, and, the, female, gametophyte, is, greatly, reduced, to, a, female, embryo, sac, with, as, few, as, eight, cells, each, pollen, grains, contains, a, greatly, reduced, male, gametophyte, consisting, of, three, or, four, cells, the, sperm, of, seed, plants, are, non, motile, except, for, two, older, groups, of, plants, the, cycadophyta, and, the, ginkgophyta, which, have, flagella, flowering, plants, the, dominant, plant, group, 168, reproduce, both, by, sexual, and, asexual, means, their, distinguishing, feature, is, that, their, reproductive, organs, are, contained, in, flowers, sexual, reproduction, in, flowering, plants, involves, the, production, of, separate, male, and, female, gametophytes, that, produce, gametes, the, anther, produces, pollen, grains, that, contain, male, gametophytes, the, pollen, grains, attach, to, the, stigma, on, top, of, a, carpel, in, which, the, female, gametophytes, inside, ovules, are, located, plants, may, either, self, pollinate, or, cross, pollinate, the, transfer, of, pollen, the, male, gametophytes, to, the, female, stigmas, occurs, is, called, pollination, after, pollination, occurs, the, pollen, grain, germinates, to, form, a, pollen, tube, that, grows, through, the, carpel, s, style, and, transports, male, nuclei, to, the, ovule, to, fertilize, the, egg, cell, and, central, cell, within, the, female, gametophyte, in, a, process, termed, double, fertilization, the, resulting, zygote, develops, into, an, embryo, while, the, triploid, endosperm, one, sperm, cell, plus, a, binucleate, female, cell, and, female, tissues, of, the, ovule, give, rise, to, the, surrounding, tissues, in, the, developing, seed, the, fertilized, ovules, develop, into, seeds, within, a, fruit, formed, from, the, ovary, when, the, seeds, are, ripe, they, may, be, dispersed, together, with, the, fruit, or, freed, from, it, by, various, means, to, germinate, and, grow, into, the, next, generation, plants, that, use, insects, or, other, animals, to, move, pollen, from, one, flower, to, the, next, have, developed, greatly, modified, flower, parts, to, attract, pollinators, and, to, facilitate, the, movement, of, pollen, from, one, flower, to, the, insect, and, from, the, insect, to, the, next, flower, flowers, of, wind, pollinated, plants, tend, to, lack, petals, and, or, sepals, typically, large, amounts, of, pollen, are, produced, and, pollination, often, occurs, early, in, the, growing, season, before, leaves, can, interfere, with, the, dispersal, of, the, pollen, many, trees, and, all, grasses, and, sedges, are, wind, pollinated, plants, have, a, number, of, different, means, to, attract, pollinators, including, color, scent, heat, nectar, glands, edible, pollen, and, flower, shape, along, with, modifications, involving, the, above, structures, two, other, conditions, play, a, very, important, role, in, the, sexual, reproduction, of, flowering, plants, the, first, is, the, timing, of, flowering, and, the, other, is, the, size, or, number, of, flowers, produced, often, plant, species, have, a, few, large, very, showy, flowers, while, others, produce, many, small, flowers, often, flowers, are, collected, together, into, large, inflorescences, to, maximize, their, visual, effect, becoming, more, noticeable, to, passing, pollinators, flowers, are, attraction, strategies, and, sexual, expressions, are, functional, strategies, used, to, produce, the, next, generation, of, plants, with, pollinators, and, plants, having, co, evolved, often, to, some, extraordinary, degrees, very, often, rendering, mutual, benefit, the, largest, family, of, flowering, plants, is, the, orchids, orchidaceae, estimated, by, some, specialists, to, include, up, to, 35, 000, species, which, often, have, highly, specialized, flowers, that, attract, particular, insects, for, pollination, the, stamens, are, modified, to, produce, pollen, in, clusters, called, pollinia, which, become, attached, to, insects, that, crawl, into, the, flower, the, flower, shapes, may, force, insects, to, pass, by, the, pollen, which, is, glued, to, the, insect, some, orchids, are, even, more, highly, specialized, with, flower, shapes, that, mimic, the, shape, of, insects, to, attract, them, to, attempt, to, mate, with, the, flowers, a, few, even, have, scents, that, mimic, insect, pheromones, another, large, group, of, flowering, plants, is, the, asteraceae, or, sunflower, family, with, close, to, 22, 000, species, which, also, have, highly, modified, inflorescences, composed, of, many, individual, flowers, called, florets, heads, with, florets, of, one, sex, when, the, flowers, are, pistillate, or, functionally, staminate, or, made, up, of, all, bisexual, florets, are, called, homogamous, and, can, include, discoid, and, liguliflorous, type, heads, some, radiate, heads, may, be, homogamous, too, plants, with, heads, that, have, florets, of, two, or, more, sexual, forms, are, called, heterogamous, and, include, radiate, and, disciform, head, forms, ferns, typically, produce, large, diploids, with, stem, roots, and, leaves, on, fertile, leaves, sporangia, are, produced, grouped, together, in, sori, and, often, protected, by, an, indusium, if, the, spores, are, deposited, onto, a, suitable, moist, substrate, they, germinate, to, produce, short, thin, free, living, gametophytes, called, prothalli, that, are, typically, heart, shaped, small, and, green, in, color, the, gametophytes, produce, both, motile, sperm, in, the, antheridia, and, egg, cells, in, separate, archegonia, after, rains, or, when, dew, deposits, a, film, of, water, the, motile, sperm, are, splashed, away, from, the, antheridia, which, are, normally, produced, on, the, top, side, of, the, thallus, and, swim, in, the, film, of, water, to, the, antheridia, where, they, fertilize, the, egg, to, promote, out, crossing, or, cross, fertilization, the, sperm, is, released, before, the, eggs, are, receptive, of, the, sperm, making, it, more, likely, that, the, sperm, will, fertilize, the, eggs, of, the, different, thallus, a, zygote, is, formed, after, fertilization, which, grows, into, a, new, sporophytic, plant, the, condition, of, having, separate, sporophyte, and, gametophyte, plants, is, called, alternation, of, generations, other, plants, with, similar, reproductive, strategies, include, psilotum, lycopodium, selaginella, and, equisetum, the, bryophytes, which, include, liverworts, hornworts, and, mosses, can, reproduce, both, sexually, and, vegetatively, the, life, cycles, of, these, plants, start, with, haploid, spores, that, grow, into, the, dominant, form, which, is, a, multicellular, haploid, gametophyte, with, thalloid, or, leaf, like, structures, that, photosynthesize, the, gametophyte, is, the, most, commonly, known, phase, of, the, plant, bryophytes, are, typically, small, plants, that, grow, in, moist, locations, and, like, ferns, have, motile, sperm, which, swim, to, the, ovule, using, flagella, and, therefore, need, water, to, facilitate, sexual, reproduction, bryophytes, show, considerable, variation, in, their, reproductive, structures, and, a, basic, outline, is, as, follows, haploid, gametes, are, produced, in, antheridia, and, archegonia, by, mitosis, the, sperm, released, from, the, antheridia, respond, to, chemicals, released, by, ripe, archegonia, and, swim, to, them, in, a, film, of, water, and, fertilize, the, egg, cells, thus, producing, zygotes, that, are, diploid, the, zygote, divides, repeatedly, by, mitotic, division, and, grows, into, a, diploid, sporophyte, the, resulting, multicellular, diploid, sporophyte, produces, spore, capsules, called, sporangia, the, spores, are, produced, by, meiosis, and, when, ripe, the, capsules, burst, open, to, release, the, spores, in, some, species, each, gametophyte, is, one, sex, while, other, species, may, be, monoicous, producing, both, antheridia, and, archegonia, on, the, same, gametophyte, which, is, thus, hermaphrodite, one, of, the, outcomes, of, plant, reproduction, is, the, generation, of, seeds, spores, gemmae, and, other, vegetative, organs, that, allow, plants, to, move, to, new, locations, or, new, habitats, plants, do, not, have, nervous, systems, or, any, will, for, their, actions, even, so, scientists, are, able, to, observe, mechanisms, that, help, their, offspring, thrive, as, they, grow, all, organisms, have, mechanisms, to, increase, survival, in, offspring, offspring, care, is, observed, in, the, mammillaria, hernandezii, a, small, cactus, found, in, mexico, a, cactus, is, a, type, of, succulent, meaning, it, retains, water, when, it, is, available, for, future, droughts, m, hernandezii, also, stores, a, portion, of, its, seeds, in, its, stem, and, releases, the, rest, to, grow, this, can, be, advantageous, for, many, reasons, by, delaying, the, release, of, some, of, its, seeds, the, cactus, can, protect, these, from, potential, threats, from, insects, herbivores, or, mold, caused, by, micro, organisms, a, study, found, that, the, presence, of, adequate, water, in, the, environment, causes, m, hernandezii, to, release, more, seeds, to, allow, for, germination, the, plant, was, able, to, perceive, a, water, potential, gradient, in, the, surroundings, and, act, by, giving, its, seeds, a, better, chance, in, this, preferable, environment, this, evolutionary, strategy, gives, a, better, potential, outcome, for, seed, germination, similar, reproductive, strategies, are, found, in, both, mammals, and, plants, one, difference, between, the, two, is, that, in, harsh, environmental, conditions, mammals, produce, fewer, and, larger, offspring, whereas, plants, produce, more, seeds
