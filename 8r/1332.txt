blood, transfusion, is, the, process, of, transferring, blood, products, into, a, person, s, circulation, intravenously, transfusions, are, used, for, various, medical, conditions, to, replace, lost, components, of, the, blood, early, transfusions, used, whole, blood, but, modern, medical, practice, commonly, uses, only, components, of, the, blood, such, as, red, blood, cells, plasma, platelets, and, other, clotting, factors, white, blood, cells, are, transfused, only, in, very, rare, circumstances, since, granulocyte, transfusion, has, limited, applications, whole, blood, has, come, back, into, use, in, the, setting, of, trauma, red, blood, cells, rbc, contain, hemoglobin, and, supply, the, cells, of, the, body, with, oxygen, white, blood, cells, are, not, commonly, used, during, transfusions, but, they, are, part, of, the, immune, system, and, also, fight, infections, plasma, is, the, yellowish, liquid, part, of, blood, which, acts, as, a, buffer, and, contains, proteins, and, other, important, substances, needed, for, the, body, s, overall, health, platelets, are, involved, in, blood, clotting, preventing, the, body, from, bleeding, before, these, components, were, known, doctors, believed, that, blood, was, homogeneous, because, of, this, scientific, misunderstanding, many, patients, died, because, of, incompatible, blood, transferred, to, them, historically, red, blood, cell, transfusion, was, considered, when, the, hemoglobin, level, fell, below, 100g, l, or, hematocrit, fell, below, 30, because, each, unit, of, blood, given, carries, risks, a, trigger, level, lower, than, that, at, 70, to, 80g, l, is, now, usually, used, as, it, has, been, shown, to, have, better, patient, outcomes, the, administration, of, a, single, unit, of, blood, is, the, standard, for, hospitalized, people, who, are, not, bleeding, with, this, treatment, followed, with, re, assessment, and, consideration, of, symptoms, and, hemoglobin, concentration, patients, with, poor, oxygen, saturation, may, need, more, blood, the, advisory, caution, to, use, blood, transfusion, only, with, more, severe, anemia, is, in, part, due, to, evidence, that, outcomes, are, worsened, if, larger, amounts, are, given, one, may, consider, transfusion, for, people, with, symptoms, of, cardiovascular, disease, such, as, chest, pain, or, shortness, of, breath, in, cases, where, patients, have, low, levels, of, hemoglobin, due, to, iron, deficiency, but, are, cardiovascularly, stable, oral, or, parenteral, iron, is, a, preferred, option, based, on, both, efficacy, and, safety, other, blood, products, are, given, where, appropriate, e, g, fresh, frozen, plasma, to, treat, clotting, deficiencies, and, platelets, to, treat, or, prevent, bleeding, in, thrombocytopenic, patients, before, a, blood, transfusion, is, given, there, are, many, steps, taken, to, ensure, quality, of, the, blood, products, compatibility, and, safety, to, the, recipient, in, 2012, a, national, blood, policy, was, in, place, in, 70, of, countries, and, 69, of, countries, had, specific, legislation, that, covers, the, safety, and, quality, of, blood, transfusion, the, source, of, blood, to, be, transfused, can, either, be, the, potential, recipient, autologous, transfusion, or, someone, else, allogeneic, or, homologous, transfusion, the, latter, is, much, more, common, than, the, former, using, another, s, blood, must, first, start, with, donation, of, blood, blood, is, most, commonly, donated, as, whole, blood, obtained, intravenously, and, mixed, with, an, anticoagulant, in, first, world, countries, donations, are, usually, anonymous, to, the, recipient, but, products, in, a, blood, bank, are, always, individually, traceable, through, the, whole, cycle, of, donation, testing, separation, into, components, storage, and, administration, to, the, recipient, this, enables, management, and, investigation, of, any, suspected, transfusion, related, disease, transmission, or, transfusion, reaction, developing, countries, rely, heavily, on, replacement, and, remunerated, donors, rather, than, voluntary, nonremunerated, donors, due, to, concerns, regarding, donation, and, transfusion, transmitted, infection, as, well, as, local, and, cultural, beliefs, it, is, unclear, whether, applying, alcohol, swab, alone, or, alcohol, swab, followed, by, antiseptic, is, able, to, reduce, contamination, of, donor, s, blood, studies, show, that, the, main, motivators, to, blood, donation, tend, to, be, prosocial, e, g, altruism, selflessness, charity, while, the, main, deterrents, include, fear, distrust, or, perceived, racial, discrimination, in, historic, contexts, donated, blood, is, usually, subjected, to, processing, after, it, is, collected, to, make, it, suitable, for, use, in, specific, patient, populations, collected, blood, is, then, separated, into, blood, components, by, centrifugation, red, blood, cells, plasma, and, platelets, plasma, can, be, further, processed, to, manufacture, albumin, protein, clotting, factor, concentrates, cryoprecipitate, fibrinogen, concentrate, and, immunoglobulins, antibodies, red, cells, plasma, and, platelets, can, also, be, donated, individually, via, a, more, complex, process, called, apheresis, before, a, recipient, receives, a, transfusion, compatibility, testing, between, donor, and, recipient, blood, must, be, done, the, first, step, before, a, transfusion, is, given, is, to, type, and, screen, the, recipient, s, blood, typing, of, recipient, s, blood, determines, the, abo, and, rh, status, the, sample, is, then, screened, for, any, alloantibodies, that, may, react, with, donor, blood, it, takes, about, 45, minutes, to, complete, depending, on, the, method, used, the, blood, bank, scientist, also, checks, for, special, requirements, of, the, patient, e, g, need, for, washed, irradiated, or, cmv, negative, blood, and, the, history, of, the, patient, to, see, if, they, have, previously, identified, antibodies, and, any, other, serological, anomalies, a, positive, screen, warrants, an, antibody, panel, investigation, to, determine, if, it, is, clinically, significant, an, antibody, panel, consists, of, commercially, prepared, group, o, red, cell, suspensions, from, donors, that, have, been, phenotyped, for, antigens, that, correspond, to, commonly, encountered, and, clinically, significant, alloantibodies, donor, cells, may, have, homozygous, e, g, k, k, heterozygous, k, k, expression, or, no, expression, of, various, antigens, k, k, the, phenotypes, of, all, the, donor, cells, being, tested, are, shown, in, a, chart, the, patient, s, serum, is, tested, against, the, various, donor, cells, using, an, indirect, coombs, test, based, on, the, reactions, of, the, patient, s, serum, against, the, donor, cells, a, pattern, will, emerge, to, confirm, the, presence, of, one, or, more, antibodies, not, all, antibodies, are, clinically, significant, i, e, cause, transfusion, reactions, hdn, etc, once, the, patient, has, developed, a, clinically, significant, antibody, it, is, vital, that, the, patient, receive, antigen, negative, red, blood, cells, to, prevent, future, transfusion, reactions, if, there, is, no, antibody, present, an, immediate, spin, crossmatch, may, be, performed, where, the, recipient, serum, and, donor, rbc, are, incubated, in, the, immediate, spin, method, two, drops, of, patient, serum, are, tested, against, a, drop, of, 3, 5, suspension, of, donor, cells, in, a, test, tube, and, spun, in, a, serofuge, agglutination, or, hemolysis, i, e, positive, coombs, test, in, the, test, tube, is, a, positive, reaction, if, the, crossmatch, is, positive, then, further, investigation, is, needed, patients, with, no, history, of, red, cell, antibodies, may, qualify, for, computer, assisted, crossmatch, which, does, not, involve, combining, patient, serum, with, donor, cells, if, an, antibody, is, suspected, potential, donor, units, must, first, be, screened, for, the, corresponding, antigen, by, phenotyping, them, antigen, negative, units, are, then, tested, against, the, patient, plasma, using, an, antiglobulin, indirect, crossmatch, technique, at, 37, degrees, celsius, to, enhance, reactivity, and, make, the, test, easier, to, read, in, urgent, cases, where, crossmatching, cannot, be, completed, and, the, risk, of, dropping, hemoglobin, outweighs, the, risk, of, transfusing, uncrossmatched, blood, o, negative, blood, is, used, followed, by, crossmatch, as, soon, as, possible, o, negative, is, also, used, for, children, and, women, of, childbearing, age, it, is, preferable, for, the, laboratory, to, obtain, a, pre, transfusion, sample, in, these, cases, so, a, type, and, screen, can, be, performed, to, determine, the, actual, blood, group, of, the, patient, and, to, check, for, alloantibodies, this, chart, shows, possible, matches, in, blood, transfusion, between, donor, and, receiver, using, abo, and, rh, system, the, symbol, indicates, compatibility, in, the, same, way, that, the, safety, of, pharmaceutical, products, is, overseen, by, pharmacovigilance, the, safety, of, blood, and, blood, products, is, overseen, by, haemovigilance, this, is, defined, by, the, world, health, organization, who, as, a, system, to, identify, and, prevent, occurrence, or, recurrence, of, transfusion, related, unwanted, events, to, increase, the, safety, efficacy, and, efficiency, of, blood, transfusion, covering, all, activities, of, the, transfusion, chain, from, donor, to, recipient, the, system, should, include, monitoring, identification, reporting, investigation, and, analysis, of, adverse, events, near, misses, and, reactions, related, to, transfusion, and, manufacturing, in, the, uk, this, data, is, collected, by, an, independent, organisation, called, shot, serious, hazards, of, transfusion, haemovigilance, systems, have, been, established, in, many, countries, with, the, objective, of, ensuring, the, safety, of, blood, for, transfusion, but, their, organisational, set, up, and, operating, principles, can, vary, transfusions, of, blood, products, are, associated, with, several, complications, many, of, which, can, be, grouped, as, immunological, or, infectious, there, is, controversy, on, potential, quality, degradation, during, storage, the, use, of, greater, amount, of, red, blood, cells, has, been, suggested, to, increase, the, risk, of, infections, not, only, transfusion, transmitted, infections, but, also, due, to, a, phenomenon, known, as, transfusion, related, immunomodulation, trim, trim, may, be, caused, by, macrophages, and, their, byproducts, in, those, who, were, given, red, blood, cells, only, with, significant, anemia, restrictive, strategy, serious, infection, rates, were, 10, 6, while, in, those, who, were, given, red, blood, at, milder, levels, of, anemia, liberal, strategy, serious, infection, rates, were, 12, 7, on, rare, occasions, blood, products, are, contaminated, with, bacteria, this, can, result, in, a, life, threatening, infection, known, as, transfusion, transmitted, bacterial, infection, the, risk, of, severe, bacterial, infection, is, estimated, as, of, 2020, at, about, 1, in, 2, 500, platelet, transfusions, and, 1, in, 2, 000, 000, red, blood, cell, transfusions, blood, product, contamination, while, rare, is, still, more, common, than, actual, infection, the, reason, platelets, are, more, often, contaminated, than, other, blood, products, is, that, they, are, stored, at, room, temperature, for, short, periods, of, time, contamination, is, also, more, common, with, longer, duration, of, storage, especially, if, that, means, more, than, 5, days, sources, of, contaminants, include, the, donor, s, blood, donor, s, skin, phlebotomist, s, skin, and, containers, contaminating, organisms, vary, greatly, and, include, skin, flora, gut, flora, and, environmental, organisms, there, are, many, strategies, in, place, at, blood, donation, centers, and, laboratories, to, reduce, the, risk, of, contamination, a, definite, diagnosis, of, transfusion, transmitted, bacterial, infection, includes, the, identification, of, a, positive, culture, in, the, recipient, without, an, alternative, diagnosis, as, well, as, the, identification, of, the, same, organism, in, the, donor, blood, since, the, advent, of, hiv, testing, of, donor, blood, in, the, mid, later, 1980s, ex, 1985, s, elisa, the, transmission, of, hiv, during, transfusion, has, dropped, dramatically, prior, testing, of, donor, blood, only, included, testing, for, antibodies, to, hiv, however, because, of, latent, infection, the, window, period, in, which, an, individual, is, infectious, but, has, not, had, time, to, develop, antibodies, many, cases, of, hiv, seropositive, blood, were, missed, the, development, of, a, nucleic, acid, test, for, the, hiv, 1, rna, has, dramatically, lowered, the, rate, of, donor, blood, seropositivity, to, about, 1, in, 3, million, units, as, transmittance, of, hiv, does, not, necessarily, mean, hiv, infection, the, latter, could, still, occur, at, an, even, lower, rate, the, transmission, of, hepatitis, c, via, transfusion, currently, stands, at, a, rate, of, about, 1, in, 2, million, units, as, with, hiv, this, low, rate, has, been, attributed, to, the, ability, to, screen, for, both, antibodies, as, well, as, viral, rna, nucleic, acid, testing, in, donor, blood, other, rare, transmissible, infections, include, hepatitis, b, syphilis, chagas, disease, cytomegalovirus, infections, in, immunocompromised, recipients, htlv, and, babesia, transfusion, inefficacy, or, insufficient, efficacy, of, a, given, unit, s, of, blood, product, while, not, itself, a, complication, per, se, can, nonetheless, indirectly, lead, to, complications, in, addition, to, causing, a, transfusion, to, fully, or, partly, fail, to, achieve, its, clinical, purpose, this, can, be, especially, significant, for, certain, patient, groups, such, as, critical, care, or, neonatals, for, red, blood, cells, rbc, by, far, the, most, commonly, transfused, product, poor, transfusion, efficacy, can, result, from, units, damaged, by, the, so, called, storage, lesion, a, range, of, biochemical, and, biomechanical, changes, that, occur, during, storage, with, red, cells, this, can, decrease, viability, and, ability, for, tissue, oxygenation, although, some, of, the, biochemical, changes, are, reversible, after, the, blood, is, transfused, the, biomechanical, changes, are, less, so, and, rejuvenation, products, are, not, yet, able, to, adequately, reverse, this, phenomenon, there, has, been, controversy, about, whether, a, given, product, unit, s, age, is, a, factor, in, transfusion, efficacy, specifically, about, whether, older, blood, directly, or, indirectly, increases, risks, of, complications, studies, have, not, been, consistent, on, answering, this, question, with, some, showing, that, older, blood, is, indeed, less, effective, but, with, others, showing, no, such, difference, these, developments, are, being, closely, followed, by, hospital, blood, bankers, who, are, the, physicians, typically, pathologists, who, collect, and, manage, inventories, of, transfusable, blood, units, certain, regulatory, measures, are, in, place, to, minimize, rbc, storage, lesion, including, a, maximum, shelf, life, currently, 42, days, a, maximum, auto, hemolysis, threshold, currently, 1, in, the, us, 0, 8, in, europe, and, a, minimum, level, of, post, transfusion, rbc, survival, in, vivo, currently, 75, after, 24, hours, however, all, of, these, criteria, are, applied, in, a, universal, manner, that, does, not, account, for, differences, among, units, of, product, for, example, testing, for, the, post, transfusion, rbc, survival, in, vivo, is, done, on, a, sample, of, healthy, volunteers, and, then, compliance, is, presumed, for, all, rbc, units, based, on, universal, gmp, processing, standards, rbc, survival, by, itself, does, not, guarantee, efficacy, but, it, is, a, necessary, prerequisite, for, cell, function, and, hence, serves, as, a, regulatory, proxy, opinions, vary, as, to, the, best, way, to, determine, transfusion, efficacy, in, a, patient, in, vivo, in, general, there, are, not, yet, any, in, vitro, tests, to, assess, quality, or, predict, efficacy, for, specific, units, of, rbc, blood, product, prior, to, their, transfusion, though, there, is, exploration, of, potentially, relevant, tests, based, on, rbc, membrane, properties, such, as, erythrocyte, deformability, and, erythrocyte, fragility, mechanical, physicians, have, adopted, a, so, called, restrictive, protocol, whereby, transfusion, is, held, to, a, minimum, in, part, because, of, the, noted, uncertainties, surrounding, storage, lesion, in, addition, to, the, very, high, direct, and, indirect, costs, of, transfusions, however, the, restrictive, protocol, is, not, an, option, with, some, especially, vulnerable, patients, who, may, require, the, best, possible, efforts, to, rapidly, restore, tissue, oxygenation, although, transfusions, of, platelets, are, far, less, numerous, relative, to, rbc, platelet, storage, lesion, and, resulting, efficacy, loss, is, also, a, concern, globally, around, 85, million, units, of, red, blood, cells, are, transfused, in, a, given, year, the, global, demand, is, much, higher, and, there, is, an, unmet, need, for, safe, blood, for, transfusion, in, many, low, and, middle, income, countries, in, the, united, states, blood, transfusions, were, performed, nearly, 3, million, times, during, hospitalizations, in, 2011, making, it, the, most, common, procedure, performed, the, rate, of, hospitalizations, with, a, blood, transfusion, nearly, doubled, from, 1997, from, a, rate, of, 40, stays, to, 95, stays, per, 10, 000, population, it, was, the, most, common, procedure, performed, for, patients, 45, years, of, age, and, older, in, 2011, and, among, the, top, five, most, common, for, patients, between, the, ages, of, 1, and, 44, years, according, to, the, new, york, times, changes, in, medicine, have, eliminated, the, need, for, millions, of, blood, transfusions, which, is, good, news, for, patients, getting, procedures, like, coronary, bypasses, and, other, procedures, that, once, required, a, lot, of, blood, and, blood, bank, revenue, is, falling, and, the, decline, may, reach, 1, 5, billion, a, year, this, year, from, a, high, of, 5, billion, in, 2008, in, 2014, the, red, cross, was, predicting, job, losses, as, high, as, 12, 000, within, the, next, three, to, five, years, roughly, a, quarter, of, the, total, in, the, industry, as, of, 2019, the, trend, of, declining, transfusions, appeared, to, be, stabilizing, with, 10, 852, 000, rbc, units, transfused, in, the, united, states, beginning, with, william, harvey, s, experiments, on, the, circulation, of, blood, recorded, research, into, blood, transfusion, began, in, the, 17th, century, with, successful, experiments, in, transfusion, between, animals, however, successive, attempts, by, physicians, to, transfuse, animal, blood, into, humans, gave, variable, often, fatal, results, pope, innocent, viii, is, sometimes, said, to, have, been, given, the, world, s, first, blood, transfusion, by, his, italian, jewish, physician, giacomo, di, san, genesio, who, had, him, drink, by, mouth, the, blood, of, three, 10, year, old, boys, the, boys, consequently, died, as, did, the, pope, himself, however, the, evidence, for, this, story, is, unreliable, and, considered, a, possible, anti, jewish, blood, libel, working, at, the, royal, society, in, the, 1660s, the, physician, richard, lower, began, examining, the, effects, of, changes, in, blood, volume, on, circulatory, function, and, developed, methods, for, cross, circulatory, study, in, animals, obviating, clotting, by, closed, arteriovenous, connections, the, new, instruments, he, was, able, to, devise, enabled, him, to, perform, the, first, reliably, documented, successful, transfusion, of, blood, in, front, of, his, distinguished, colleagues, from, the, royal, society, according, to, lower, s, account, towards, the, end, of, february, 1665, selected, one, dog, of, medium, size, opened, its, jugular, vein, and, drew, off, blood, until, its, strength, was, nearly, gone, then, to, make, up, for, the, great, loss, of, this, dog, by, the, blood, of, a, second, i, introduced, blood, from, the, cervical, artery, of, a, fairly, large, mastiff, which, had, been, fastened, alongside, the, first, until, this, latter, animal, showed, it, was, overfilled, by, the, inflowing, blood, after, he, sewed, up, the, jugular, veins, the, animal, recovered, with, no, sign, of, discomfort, or, of, displeasure, lower, had, performed, the, first, blood, transfusion, between, animals, he, was, then, requested, by, the, honorable, boyle, to, acquaint, the, royal, society, with, the, procedure, for, the, whole, experiment, which, he, did, in, december, 1665, in, the, society, s, philosophical, transactions, the, first, blood, transfusion, from, animal, to, human, was, administered, by, dr, jean, baptiste, denys, eminent, physician, to, king, louis, xiv, of, france, on, june, 15, 1667, he, transfused, the, blood, of, a, sheep, into, a, 15, year, old, boy, who, survived, the, transfusion, denys, performed, another, transfusion, into, a, labourer, who, also, survived, both, instances, were, likely, due, to, the, small, amount, of, blood, that, was, actually, transfused, into, these, people, this, allowed, them, to, withstand, the, allergic, reaction, denys, s, third, patient, to, undergo, a, blood, transfusion, was, swedish, baron, gustaf, bonde, he, received, two, transfusions, after, the, second, transfusion, bonde, died, in, the, winter, of, 1667, denys, performed, several, transfusions, on, antoine, mauroy, with, calf, s, blood, on, the, third, account, mauroy, died, six, months, later, in, london, lower, performed, the, first, human, transfusion, of, animal, blood, in, britain, where, he, superintended, the, introduction, in, arm, at, various, times, of, some, ounces, of, sheep, s, blood, at, a, meeting, of, the, royal, society, and, without, any, inconvenience, to, him, the, recipient, was, arthur, coga, the, subject, of, a, harmless, form, of, insanity, sheep, s, blood, was, used, because, of, speculation, about, the, value, of, blood, exchange, between, species, it, had, been, suggested, that, blood, from, a, gentle, lamb, might, quiet, the, tempestuous, spirit, of, an, agitated, person, and, that, the, shy, might, be, made, outgoing, by, blood, from, more, sociable, creatures, coga, received, 20, shillings, equivalent, to, 217, in, 2023, to, participate, in, the, experiment, lower, went, on, to, pioneer, new, devices, for, the, precise, control, of, blood, flow, and, the, transfusion, of, blood, his, designs, were, substantially, the, same, as, modern, syringes, and, catheters, shortly, after, lower, moved, to, london, where, his, growing, practice, soon, led, him, to, abandon, research, these, early, experiments, with, animal, blood, provoked, a, heated, controversy, in, britain, and, france, finally, in, 1668, the, royal, society, and, the, french, government, both, banned, the, procedure, the, vatican, condemned, these, experiments, in, 1670, blood, transfusions, fell, into, obscurity, for, the, next, 150, years, the, science, of, blood, transfusion, dates, to, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, with, the, discovery, of, distinct, blood, types, leading, to, the, practice, of, mixing, some, blood, from, the, donor, and, the, receiver, before, the, transfusion, an, early, form, of, cross, matching, in, the, early, 19th, century, british, obstetrician, dr, james, blundell, made, efforts, to, treat, hemorrhage, by, transfusion, of, human, blood, using, a, syringe, in, 1818, after, experiments, with, animals, he, performed, the, first, successful, transfusion, of, human, blood, to, treat, postpartum, hemorrhage, blundell, used, the, patient, s, husband, as, a, donor, and, extracted, four, ounces, of, blood, from, his, arm, to, transfuse, into, his, wife, during, the, years, 1825, and, 1830, blundell, performed, 10, transfusions, five, of, which, were, beneficial, and, published, his, results, he, also, invented, a, number, of, instruments, for, the, transfusion, of, blood, he, made, a, substantial, amount, of, money, from, this, endeavour, roughly, 2, million, 50, million, real, dollars, in, 1840, at, st, george, s, hospital, medical, school, in, london, samuel, armstrong, lane, aided, by, blundell, performed, the, first, successful, whole, blood, transfusion, to, treat, haemophilia, however, early, transfusions, were, risky, and, many, resulted, in, the, death, of, the, patient, by, the, late, 19th, century, blood, transfusion, was, regarded, as, a, risky, and, dubious, procedure, and, was, largely, shunned, by, the, medical, establishment, work, to, emulate, james, blundell, continued, in, edinburgh, in, 1845, the, edinburgh, journal, described, the, successful, transfusion, of, blood, to, a, woman, with, severe, uterine, bleeding, subsequent, transfusions, were, successful, with, patients, of, professor, james, young, simpson, after, whom, the, simpson, memorial, maternity, pavilion, in, edinburgh, was, named, various, isolated, reports, of, successful, transfusions, emerged, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, largest, series, of, early, successful, transfusions, took, place, at, the, edinburgh, royal, infirmary, between, 1885, and, 1892, edinburgh, later, became, the, home, of, the, first, blood, donation, and, blood, transfusion, services, only, in, 1901, when, the, austrian, karl, landsteiner, discovered, three, human, blood, groups, o, a, and, b, did, blood, transfusion, achieve, a, scientific, basis, and, become, safer, landsteiner, discovered, that, adverse, effects, arise, from, mixing, blood, from, two, incompatible, individuals, he, found, that, mixing, incompatible, types, triggers, an, immune, response, and, the, red, blood, cells, clump, the, immunological, reaction, occurs, when, the, receiver, of, a, blood, transfusion, has, antibodies, against, the, donor, blood, cells, the, destruction, of, red, blood, cells, releases, free, hemoglobin, into, the, bloodstream, which, can, have, fatal, consequences, landsteiner, s, work, made, it, possible, to, determine, blood, group, and, allowed, blood, transfusions, to, take, place, much, more, safely, for, his, discovery, he, won, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, and, medicine, in, 1930, many, other, blood, groups, have, been, discovered, since, george, washington, crile, is, credited, with, performing, the, first, surgery, using, a, direct, blood, transfusion, in, 1906, at, st, alexis, hospital, in, cleveland, while, a, professor, of, surgery, at, case, western, reserve, university, jan, jansk, also, discovered, the, human, blood, groups, in, 1907, he, classified, blood, into, four, groups, i, ii, iii, iv, his, nomenclature, is, still, used, in, russia, and, in, states, of, the, former, ussr, in, which, blood, types, o, a, b, and, ab, are, respectively, designated, i, ii, iii, and, iv, dr, william, lorenzo, moss, s, 1876, 1957, moss, blood, typing, technique, of, 1910, was, widely, used, until, world, war, ii, william, stewart, halsted, m, d, 1852, 1922, an, american, surgeon, performed, one, of, the, first, blood, transfusions, in, the, united, states, he, had, been, called, to, see, his, sister, after, she, had, given, birth, he, found, her, moribund, from, blood, loss, and, in, a, bold, move, withdrew, his, own, blood, transfused, his, blood, into, his, sister, and, then, operated, on, her, to, save, her, life, while, the, first, transfusions, had, to, be, made, directly, from, donor, to, receiver, before, coagulation, it, was, discovered, that, by, adding, anticoagulant, and, refrigerating, the, blood, it, was, possible, to, store, it, for, some, days, thus, opening, the, way, for, the, development, of, blood, banks, john, braxton, hicks, was, the, first, to, experiment, with, chemical, methods, to, prevent, the, coagulation, of, blood, at, st, mary, s, hospital, london, in, the, late, 19th, century, his, attempts, using, phosphate, of, soda, however, proved, unsuccessful, the, belgian, doctor, albert, hustin, performed, the, first, non, direct, transfusion, on, march, 27, 1914, though, this, involved, a, diluted, solution, of, blood, the, argentine, doctor, luis, agote, used, a, much, less, diluted, solution, in, november, of, the, same, year, both, used, sodium, citrate, as, an, anticoagulant, the, first, world, war, 1914, 1918, acted, as, a, catalyst, for, the, rapid, development, of, blood, banks, and, transfusion, techniques, francis, peyton, rous, and, joseph, r, turner, at, the, rockefeller, university, then, the, rockefeller, institute, for, medical, research, made, the, first, important, discoveries, that, blood, typing, was, necessary, to, avoid, blood, clumping, coagulation, and, blood, samples, could, be, preserved, using, chemical, treatment, their, first, report, in, march, 1915, showed, that, gelatine, agar, blood, serum, extracts, starch, and, beef, albumin, proved, to, be, useless, preservatives, however, building, on, the, same, experiment, they, discovered, that, a, mixture, sodium, citrate, and, glucose, dextrose, solution, was, a, perfect, preservative, as, they, reported, in, february, issue, of, the, journal, of, experimental, medicine, the, preserved, bloods, were, just, like, fresh, bloods, and, that, they, function, excellently, when, reintroduced, into, the, body, blood, could, be, preserved, for, up, to, four, weeks, an, accompanying, experiment, using, citrate, saccharose, sucrose, mixture, was, also, a, success, which, could, maintain, blood, cells, for, two, weeks, this, use, of, citrate, and, sugars, sometimes, known, as, rous, turner, solution, was, the, foundation, for, the, development, of, blood, banks, and, improvement, of, transfusion, method, another, discovery, of, rous, and, turner, was, the, most, critical, step, in, the, safety, of, blood, transfusion, rous, was, well, aware, that, landsteiner, s, concept, of, blood, types, had, not, yet, find, practical, value, as, he, remarked, the, fate, of, landsteiner, s, effort, to, call, attention, to, the, practical, bearing, of, the, group, differences, in, human, bloods, provides, an, exquisite, instance, of, knowledge, marking, time, on, technique, transfusion, was, still, not, done, because, until, at, least, 1915, the, risk, of, clotting, was, too, great, in, june, 1915, they, made, a, crucial, report, in, the, journal, of, the, american, medical, association, that, agglutination, could, be, avoided, if, the, blood, samples, of, the, donor, and, recipient, were, tested, before, which, they, called, a, rapid, and, simple, method, for, testing, blood, compatibility, sodium, citrate, was, used, to, dilute, the, blood, samples, and, after, mixing, the, recipient, s, and, donor, s, blood, in, 9, 1, and, 1, 1, parts, blood, would, either, clump, or, remain, watery, after, 15, minutes, according, to, their, advice, blood, without, clumping, should, always, be, chosen, if, possible, canadian, doctor, and, lieutenant, lawrence, bruce, robertson, became, instrumental, in, persuading, the, royal, army, medical, corps, to, adopt, the, use, of, blood, transfusion, at, the, casualty, clearing, stations, for, the, wounded, in, october, 1915, robertson, performed, his, first, wartime, transfusion, with, a, syringe, to, a, patient, who, had, multiple, shrapnel, wounds, he, followed, this, up, with, four, subsequent, transfusions, in, the, following, months, and, his, success, was, reported, to, sir, walter, morley, fletcher, director, of, the, medical, research, committee, robertson, published, his, findings, in, the, british, medical, journal, in, 1916, and, with, the, help, of, a, few, like, minded, individuals, including, the, eminent, physician, edward, william, archibald, was, able, to, persuade, the, british, authorities, of, the, merits, of, blood, transfusion, robertson, went, on, to, establish, the, first, blood, transfusion, apparatus, at, a, casualty, clearing, station, on, the, western, front, in, the, spring, of, 1917, robertson, did, not, test, crossmatching, so, that, one, died, of, hemolysis, in, his, 1916, transfusion, and, three, in, 1917, oswald, hope, robertson, a, medical, researcher, and, u, s, army, officer, was, attached, to, the, ramc, in, 1917, where, he, became, instrumental, in, establishing, the, first, blood, banks, in, preparation, for, the, anticipated, third, battle, of, ypres, he, used, sodium, citrate, as, the, anticoagulant, blood, was, extracted, from, punctures, in, the, vein, and, was, stored, in, bottles, at, british, and, american, casualty, clearing, stations, along, the, front, robertson, also, experimented, with, preserving, separated, red, blood, cells, in, iced, bottles, geoffrey, keynes, a, british, surgeon, developed, a, portable, machine, that, could, store, blood, to, enable, transfusions, to, be, carried, out, more, easily, the, secretary, of, the, british, red, cross, percy, lane, oliver, established, the, world, s, first, blood, donor, service, in, 1921, in, that, year, oliver, was, contacted, by, king, s, college, hospital, where, they, were, in, urgent, need, of, a, blood, donor, after, providing, a, donor, oliver, set, about, organizing, a, system, for, the, voluntary, registration, of, blood, donors, at, clinics, around, london, with, sir, geoffrey, keynes, appointed, as, a, medical, adviser, volunteers, were, subjected, to, a, series, of, physical, tests, to, establish, their, blood, group, the, london, blood, transfusion, service, was, free, of, charge, and, expanded, rapidly, in, its, first, few, years, of, operation, by, 1925, it, was, providing, services, for, almost, 500, patients, it, was, incorporated, into, the, structure, of, the, british, red, cross, in, 1926, similar, systems, developed, in, other, cities, including, sheffield, manchester, and, norwich, and, the, service, s, work, began, to, attract, international, attention, france, germany, austria, belgium, australia, and, japan, established, similar, services, alexander, bogdanov, founded, an, academic, institution, devoted, to, the, science, of, blood, transfusion, in, moscow, in, 1925, bogdanov, was, motivated, at, least, in, part, by, a, search, for, eternal, youth, and, remarked, with, satisfaction, on, the, improvement, of, his, eyesight, suspension, of, balding, and, other, positive, symptoms, after, receiving, 11, transfusions, of, whole, blood, bogdanov, died, in, 1928, as, a, result, of, one, of, his, experiments, when, the, blood, of, a, student, with, malaria, and, tuberculosis, was, given, to, him, in, a, transfusion, following, bogdanov, s, lead, vladimir, shamov, and, sergei, yudin, in, the, ussr, pioneered, the, transfusion, of, cadaveric, blood, from, recently, deceased, donors, yudin, performed, such, a, transfusion, successfully, for, the, first, time, on, march, 23, 1930, and, reported, his, first, seven, clinical, transfusions, with, cadaveric, blood, at, the, fourth, congress, of, ukrainian, surgeons, at, kharkiv, in, september, however, this, method, was, never, used, widely, even, in, the, soviet, union, nevertheless, the, soviet, union, was, the, first, to, establish, a, network, of, facilities, to, collect, and, store, blood, for, use, in, transfusions, at, hospitals, frederic, dur, n, jord, established, one, of, the, earliest, blood, banks, during, the, spanish, civil, war, in, 1936, duran, joined, the, transfusion, service, at, the, barcelona, hospital, at, the, start, of, the, conflict, but, the, hospital, was, soon, overwhelmed, by, the, demand, for, blood, and, the, paucity, of, available, donors, with, support, from, the, department, of, health, of, the, spanish, republican, army, duran, established, a, blood, bank, for, the, use, of, wounded, soldiers, and, civilians, the, 300, 400, ml, of, extracted, blood, was, mixed, with, 10, citrate, solution, in, a, modified, duran, erlenmeyer, flask, the, blood, was, stored, in, a, sterile, glass, enclosed, under, pressure, at, 2, c, during, 30, months, of, work, the, transfusion, service, of, barcelona, registered, almost, 30, 000, donors, and, processed, 9, 000, liters, of, blood, in, 1937, bernard, fantus, director, of, therapeutics, at, the, cook, county, hospital, in, chicago, established, the, first, hospital, blood, bank, in, the, united, states, in, setting, up, a, hospital, laboratory, that, preserved, refrigerated, and, stored, donor, blood, fantus, originated, the, term, blood, bank, within, a, few, years, hospital, and, community, blood, banks, were, established, across, the, united, states, frederic, dur, n, jord, fled, to, britain, in, 1938, and, worked, with, dr, janet, vaughan, at, the, royal, postgraduate, medical, school, at, hammersmith, hospital, to, establish, a, system, of, national, blood, banks, in, london, with, the, outbreak, of, war, appearing, imminent, in, 1938, the, war, office, created, the, army, blood, supply, depot, absd, in, bristol, headed, by, lionel, whitby, and, in, control, of, four, large, blood, depots, around, the, country, british, policy, through, the, war, was, to, supply, military, personnel, with, blood, from, centralized, depots, in, contrast, to, the, approach, taken, by, the, americans, and, germans, where, troops, at, the, front, were, bled, to, provide, required, blood, the, british, method, proved, more, successful, in, adequately, meeting, all, requirements, and, over, 700, 000, donors, were, bled, over, the, course, of, the, war, this, system, evolved, into, the, national, blood, transfusion, service, established, in, 1946, the, first, national, service, to, be, implemented, stories, tell, of, nazis, in, eastern, europe, during, world, war, ii, using, captive, children, as, repeated, involuntary, blood, donors, a, blood, collection, program, was, initiated, in, the, us, in, 1940, and, edwin, cohn, pioneered, the, process, of, blood, fractionation, he, worked, out, the, techniques, for, isolating, the, serum, albumin, fraction, of, blood, plasma, which, is, essential, for, maintaining, the, osmotic, pressure, in, the, blood, vessels, preventing, their, collapse, gordon, r, ward, writing, in, the, correspondence, columns, of, the, british, medical, journal, proposed, the, use, of, blood, plasma, as, a, substitute, for, whole, blood, and, for, transfusion, purposes, as, early, as, 1918, at, the, onset, of, world, war, ii, liquid, plasma, was, used, in, britain, a, large, project, known, as, blood, for, britain, began, in, august, 1940, to, collect, blood, in, new, york, city, hospitals, for, the, export, of, plasma, to, britain, a, freeze, dried, plasma, package, was, developed, by, the, surgeons, general, of, the, army, and, navy, working, with, the, national, research, council, which, reduced, breakage, and, made, transportation, packaging, and, storage, much, simpler, the, resulting, dried, plasma, package, came, in, two, tin, cans, containing, 400, ml, bottles, one, bottle, contained, enough, distilled, water, to, reconstitute, the, dried, plasma, contained, within, the, other, bottle, in, about, three, minutes, the, plasma, would, be, ready, to, use, and, could, stay, fresh, for, around, four, hours, dr, charles, r, drew, was, appointed, medical, supervisor, and, he, was, able, to, transform, the, test, tube, methods, into, the, first, successful, technique, for, mass, production, another, important, breakthrough, came, in, 1937, 40, when, karl, landsteiner, 1868, 1943, alex, wiener, philip, levine, and, r, e, stetson, discovered, the, rhesus, blood, group, system, which, was, found, to, be, the, cause, of, the, majority, of, transfusion, reactions, up, to, that, time, three, years, later, the, introduction, by, j, f, loutit, and, patrick, l, mollison, of, acid, citrate, dextrose, acd, solution, which, reduced, the, volume, of, anticoagulant, permitted, transfusions, of, greater, volumes, of, blood, and, allowed, longer, term, storage, carl, walter, and, w, p, murphy, jr, introduced, the, plastic, bag, for, blood, collection, in, 1950, replacing, breakable, glass, bottles, with, durable, plastic, bags, made, from, pvc, allowed, for, the, evolution, of, a, collection, system, capable, of, safe, and, easy, preparation, of, multiple, blood, components, from, a, single, unit, of, whole, blood, in, the, field, of, cancer, surgery, the, replacement, of, massive, blood, loss, became, a, major, problem, the, cardiac, arrest, rate, was, high, in, 1963, c, paul, boyan, and, william, s, howland, discovered, that, the, temperature, of, the, blood, and, the, rate, of, infusion, greatly, affected, survival, rates, and, introduced, blood, warming, to, surgery, further, extending, the, shelf, life, of, stored, blood, up, to, 42, days, was, an, anticoagulant, preservative, cpda, 1, introduced, in, 1979, which, increased, the, blood, supply, and, facilitated, resource, sharing, among, blood, banks, as, of, 2006, about, 15, million, units, of, blood, products, were, transfused, per, year, in, the, united, states, by, 2013, the, number, had, declined, to, about, 11, million, units, because, of, the, shift, towards, laparoscopic, surgery, and, other, surgical, advances, and, studies, that, have, shown, that, many, transfusions, were, unnecessary, for, example, the, standard, of, care, reduced, the, amount, of, blood, transfused, in, one, case, from, 750, to, 200, ml, in, 2019, 10, 852, 000, rbc, units, 2, 243, 000, platelet, units, and, 2, 285, 000, plasma, units, were, transfused, in, the, united, states, to, ensure, the, safety, of, blood, transfusion, to, pediatric, patients, hospitals, are, taking, additional, precautions, to, avoid, infection, and, prefer, to, use, pediatric, blood, units, that, are, guaranteed, safe, from, cytomegalovirus, some, guidelines, have, recommended, the, provision, of, cmv, negative, blood, components, and, not, simply, leukoreduced, components, for, newborns, or, low, birthweight, infants, in, whom, the, immune, system, is, not, fully, developed, but, practice, varies, these, requirements, place, additional, restrictions, on, blood, donors, who, can, donate, for, neonatal, use, which, may, be, impractical, given, the, rarity, of, cmv, seronegative, donors, and, the, preference, for, fresh, units, neonatal, transfusions, typically, fall, into, one, of, two, categories, a, massive, transfusion, protocol, is, used, when, significant, blood, loss, is, present, such, as, in, major, trauma, when, more, than, ten, units, of, blood, are, needed, packed, red, blood, cells, fresh, frozen, plasma, and, platelets, are, generally, administered, typical, ratios, of, fresh, frozen, plasma, platelets, and, packed, red, blood, cells, are, between, 1, 1, 1, and, 1, 1, 2, in, some, locations, blood, has, begun, to, be, administered, pre, hospital, in, an, effort, to, reduce, preventable, deaths, from, significant, blood, loss, earlier, analyses, suggested, that, in, the, us, up, to, 31, 000, patients, per, year, bleed, to, death, that, otherwise, could, have, survived, if, pre, hospital, transfusions, were, widely, available, for, example, when, a, mother, experiences, severe, blood, loss, during, pregnancy, ambulances, are, able, to, arrive, with, blood, stored, in, portable, fda, listed, blood, refrigerators, similar, to, those, found, in, blood, banks, once, the, infusion, is, given, on, scene, the, patient, and, the, ambulance, have, more, time, to, get, to, a, hospital, for, surgery, and, additional, infusions, if, needed, this, could, be, critical, in, rural, areas, or, sprawling, cities, where, patients, can, be, far, from, a, major, hospital, and, the, local, emergency, medical, team, may, need, to, use, blood, infusions, to, keep, that, patient, alive, during, transport, larger, studies, pointed, to, improvements, in, 24, hour, mortality, with, pre, hospital, plasma, and, rbc, transfusions, but, no, difference, in, 30, day, or, long, term, mortality, because, blood, type, o, negative, is, compatible, with, anyone, it, is, often, overused, and, in, short, supply, according, to, the, association, for, the, advancement, of, blood, and, biotherapies, the, use, of, this, blood, should, be, restricted, to, persons, with, o, negative, blood, as, nothing, else, is, compatible, with, them, and, women, who, might, be, pregnant, and, for, whom, it, would, be, impossible, to, do, blood, group, testing, before, giving, them, emergency, treatment, whenever, possible, the, aabb, recommends, that, o, negative, blood, be, conserved, by, using, blood, type, testing, to, identify, a, less, scarce, alternative, jehovah, s, witnesses, may, object, to, blood, transfusions, because, of, their, belief, that, blood, is, sacred, although, there, are, clinical, situations, where, transfusion, with, red, blood, cells, is, the, only, clinically, appropriate, option, clinicians, look, at, whether, alternatives, are, feasible, this, can, be, due, to, several, reasons, such, as, patient, safety, economic, burden, or, scarcity, of, blood, guidelines, recommend, blood, transfusions, should, be, reserved, for, patients, with, or, at, risk, of, cardiovascular, instability, due, to, the, degree, of, their, anaemia, in, stable, patients, with, iron, deficiency, anemia, oral, or, parenteral, iron, is, recommended, thus, far, there, are, no, fda, approved, oxygen, carrying, blood, substitutes, which, is, the, typical, objective, of, a, blood, rbc, transfusion, non, blood, volume, expanders, are, available, for, cases, where, only, volume, restoration, is, required, but, a, substance, with, oxygen, carrying, capacity, would, help, doctors, and, surgeons, avoid, the, risks, of, disease, transmission, and, immune, suppression, address, the, chronic, blood, donor, shortage, and, address, the, concerns, of, jehovah, s, witnesses, and, others, who, have, religious, objections, to, receiving, transfused, blood, the, research, in, this, area, is, ongoing, a, number, of, blood, substitutes, have, been, explored, but, thus, far, they, all, have, serious, limitations, most, attempts, to, find, a, suitable, alternative, to, blood, thus, far, have, concentrated, on, cell, free, hemoglobin, solutions, blood, substitutes, could, make, transfusions, more, readily, available, in, emergency, medicine, and, in, pre, hospital, ems, care, if, successful, such, a, blood, substitute, could, save, many, lives, particularly, in, trauma, where, massive, blood, loss, results, hemopure, a, hemoglobin, based, therapy, is, approved, for, use, in, south, africa, and, has, been, used, in, the, united, states, on, a, case, by, case, basis, through, the, emergency, investigational, new, drug, ind, process, veterinarians, also, administer, transfusions, to, other, animals, various, species, require, different, levels, of, testing, to, ensure, a, compatible, match, for, example, cats, have, 3, known, blood, types, cattle, have, 11, dogs, have, at, least, 13, pigs, have, 16, and, horses, over, 30, however, in, many, species, especially, horses, and, dogs, cross, matching, is, not, required, before, the, first, transfusion, as, antibodies, against, non, self, cell, surface, antigens, are, not, expressed, constitutively, i, e, the, animal, has, to, be, sensitized, before, it, will, mount, an, immune, response, against, the, transfused, blood, the, rare, and, experimental, practice, of, inter, species, blood, transfusions, xenotransfusion, is, a, form, of, xenograft
