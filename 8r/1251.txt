a, cigarette, is, a, narrow, cylinder, containing, a, combustible, material, typically, tobacco, that, is, rolled, into, thin, paper, for, smoking, the, cigarette, is, ignited, at, one, end, causing, it, to, smolder, the, resulting, smoke, is, orally, inhaled, via, the, opposite, end, cigarette, smoking, is, the, most, common, method, of, tobacco, consumption, the, term, cigarette, as, commonly, used, refers, to, a, tobacco, cigarette, but, the, word, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, other, substances, such, as, a, cannabis, cigarette, or, a, herbal, cigarette, a, cigarette, is, distinguished, from, a, cigar, by, its, usually, smaller, size, use, of, processed, leaf, different, smoking, method, and, paper, wrapping, which, is, typically, white, there, are, significant, negative, health, effects, from, smoking, cigarettes, such, as, cancer, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, heart, disease, birth, defects, and, other, health, problems, relating, to, nearly, every, organ, of, the, body, most, modern, cigarettes, are, filtered, although, this, does, not, make, the, smoke, inhaled, from, them, contain, fewer, carcinogens, and, harmful, chemicals, nicotine, the, psychoactive, drug, in, tobacco, makes, cigarettes, highly, addictive, about, half, of, cigarette, smokers, die, of, tobacco, related, disease, and, lose, on, average, 14, years, of, life, every, year, cigarette, smoking, causes, more, than, 8, million, deaths, worldwide, more, than, 1, 3, million, of, these, are, non, smokers, dying, as, the, result, of, exposure, to, secondhand, smoke, these, harmful, effects, have, led, to, legislation, that, has, prohibited, smoking, in, many, workplaces, and, public, areas, regulated, marketing, and, purchasing, age, of, tobacco, and, levied, taxes, to, discourage, cigarette, use, in, the, 21st, century, a, product, called, an, electronic, cigarette, also, called, an, e, cigarette, or, vape, was, developed, in, which, the, substance, contained, within, it, typically, a, liquid, solution, containing, nicotine, is, vaporized, by, a, battery, powered, heating, element, as, opposed, to, being, burned, such, devices, are, commonly, promoted, by, their, manufacturers, as, safer, alternatives, to, conventional, cigarettes, although, there, are, some, health, risks, associated, with, their, use, since, e, cigarettes, are, a, relatively, new, product, scientists, do, not, possess, data, on, their, possible, long, term, health, effects, the, earliest, forms, of, cigarettes, were, similar, to, their, predecessor, the, cigar, cigarettes, appear, to, have, had, antecedents, in, mexico, and, central, america, around, the, 9th, century, in, the, form, of, reeds, and, smoking, tubes, the, maya, and, later, the, aztecs, smoked, tobacco, and, other, psychoactive, drugs, in, religious, rituals, and, frequently, depicted, priests, and, deities, smoking, on, pottery, and, temple, engravings, the, cigarette, and, the, cigar, were, the, most, common, methods, of, smoking, in, the, caribbean, mexico, and, central, and, south, america, until, recent, times, the, north, american, central, american, and, south, american, cigarette, used, various, plant, wrappers, when, it, was, brought, back, to, spain, maize, wrappers, were, introduced, and, by, the, 17th, century, fine, paper, the, resulting, product, was, called, papelate, and, is, documented, in, goya, s, paintings, la, cometa, la, merienda, en, el, manzanares, and, el, juego, de, la, pelota, a, pala, 18th, century, by, 1830, the, cigarette, had, crossed, into, france, where, it, received, the, name, cigarette, and, in, 1845, the, french, state, tobacco, monopoly, began, manufacturing, them, the, french, word, made, its, way, into, english, in, the, 1840s, some, american, reformers, promoted, the, spelling, cigaret, but, this, was, never, widespread, and, is, now, largely, abandoned, cigarettes, are, sometimes, also, called, a, fag, in, british, slang, the, first, patented, cigarette, making, machine, was, invented, by, juan, nepomuceno, adorno, of, mexico, in, 1847, in, the, 1850s, turkish, cigarette, leaves, had, become, popular, however, production, climbed, markedly, when, another, cigarette, making, machine, was, developed, in, the, 1880s, by, james, albert, bonsack, which, vastly, increased, the, productivity, of, cigarette, companies, which, went, from, making, about, 40, 000, hand, rolled, cigarettes, daily, to, around, 4, million, at, the, time, these, imported, cigarettes, from, the, united, states, had, significant, sales, among, british, smokers, in, the, english, speaking, world, the, use, of, tobacco, in, cigarette, form, became, increasingly, widespread, during, and, after, the, crimean, war, when, british, soldiers, began, emulating, their, ottoman, turkish, comrades, and, russian, enemies, who, had, begun, rolling, and, smoking, tobacco, in, strips, of, old, newspaper, for, lack, of, proper, cigar, rolling, leaf, this, was, helped, by, the, development, of, tobaccos, suitable, for, cigarette, use, and, by, the, development, of, the, egyptian, cigarette, export, industry, cigarettes, may, have, been, initially, used, in, a, manner, similar, to, pipes, cigars, and, cigarillos, and, not, inhaled, as, cigarette, tobacco, became, milder, and, more, acidic, inhaling, may, have, become, perceived, as, more, agreeable, a, sentiment, supported, by, advertising, in, the, 1930s, however, helmuth, von, moltke, noticed, in, the, 1830s, that, ottomans, and, he, himself, inhaled, the, turkish, tobacco, and, latakia, from, their, pipes, which, are, both, initially, sun, cured, acidic, leaf, varieties, the, widespread, smoking, of, cigarettes, in, the, western, world, is, largely, a, 20th, century, phenomenon, by, the, late, 19th, century, cigarettes, were, known, as, coffin, nails, but, the, link, between, lung, cancer, and, smoking, was, not, established, until, the, 20th, century, german, doctors, were, the, first, to, make, the, link, and, it, led, to, the, first, antitobacco, movement, in, nazi, germany, during, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, cigarettes, were, rationed, to, soldiers, during, the, vietnam, war, cigarettes, were, included, with, c, ration, meals, in, 1975, the, u, s, government, stopped, putting, cigarettes, in, military, rations, during, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, adverse, health, effects, of, tobacco, smoking, started, to, become, widely, known, and, printed, health, warnings, became, common, on, cigarette, packets, graphical, cigarette, warning, labels, are, a, more, effective, method, to, communicate, to, the, public, the, dangers, of, cigarette, smoking, canada, mexico, belgium, denmark, sweden, thailand, malaysia, india, pakistan, australia, argentina, brazil, chile, peru, greece, the, netherlands, new, zealand, norway, hungary, the, united, kingdom, france, romania, singapore, egypt, jordan, nepal, and, turkey, all, have, both, textual, warnings, and, graphic, visual, images, displaying, among, other, things, the, damaging, effects, tobacco, use, has, on, the, human, body, the, united, states, has, implemented, textual, but, not, graphical, warnings, the, cigarette, has, evolved, much, since, its, conception, for, example, the, thin, bands, that, travel, transverse, to, the, axis, of, smoking, thus, forming, circles, along, the, length, of, the, cigarette, are, alternate, sections, of, thin, and, thick, paper, to, facilitate, effective, burning, when, being, drawn, and, retard, burning, when, at, rest, synthetic, particulate, filters, may, remove, some, of, the, tar, before, it, reaches, the, smoker, the, holy, grail, for, cigarette, companies, has, been, a, cancer, free, cigarette, on, record, the, closest, historical, attempt, was, produced, by, scientist, james, mold, under, the, name, project, tame, he, produced, the, xa, cigarette, however, in, 1978, his, project, was, terminated, since, 1950, the, average, nicotine, and, tar, content, of, cigarettes, has, steadily, fallen, research, has, shown, that, the, fall, in, overall, nicotine, content, has, led, to, smokers, inhaling, larger, volumes, per, puff, one, entrepreneur, who, was, quick, to, spot, the, advantages, of, machine, made, cigarettes, was, james, buchanan, duke, previously, a, producer, of, smoking, tobacco, only, his, firm, w, duke, sons, co, entered, the, cigarette, industry, in, the, early, 1880s, after, installing, two, bonsack, machines, duke, spent, heavily, on, advertising, and, sales, promotion, with, the, result, that, by, 1889, his, was, the, largest, cigarette, manufacturer, in, the, country, the, new, bonsack, machines, were, of, decisive, importance, in, rapid, cheap, manufacture, of, all, tobacco, products, but, one, cigars, needed, slow, laborious, hand, rolling, and, were, produced, in, hundreds, of, small, workshops, especially, in, new, york, city, in, 1890, duke, and, the, other, four, major, cigarette, companies, combined, to, form, the, american, tobacco, company, a, firm, that, dominated, the, market, and, used, aggressive, tactics, on, hundreds, of, small, competitors, until, they, sold, out, it, was, called, the, tobacco, trust, the, trust, soon, expanded, its, operations, to, include, cigars, smoking, chewing, tobacco, and, snuff, among, the, companies, drawn, into, this, organization, were, plug, manufacturers, liggett, myers, and, r, j, reynolds, tobacco, company, which, at, the, time, produced, twist, and, flat, plug, and, p, lorillard, an, old, line, manufacturer, of, snuff, by, 1910, the, trust, produced, 86, of, all, cigarettes, produced, in, the, united, states, and, 75, to, 95, of, other, forms, but, only, 14, of, the, cigars, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, the, per, capita, annual, consumption, in, the, u, s, was, 54, cigarettes, with, fewer, than, 0, 5, of, the, population, smoking, more, than, 100, cigarettes, per, year, and, consumption, there, peaked, at, 4, 259, per, capita, in, 1965, at, that, time, about, 50, of, men, and, 33, of, women, smoked, defined, as, smoking, more, than, 100, cigarettes, per, year, by, 2000, consumption, had, fallen, to, 2, 092, per, capita, corresponding, to, about, 30, of, men, and, 22, of, women, smoking, more, than, 100, cigarettes, per, year, and, by, 2006, per, capita, consumption, had, declined, to, 1, 691, implying, that, about, 21, of, the, population, smoked, 100, cigarettes, or, more, per, year, manufacturers, have, described, the, cigarette, as, a, drug, administration, system, for, the, delivery, of, nicotine, in, acceptable, and, attractive, form, modern, commercially, manufactured, cigarettes, are, seemingly, simple, objects, consisting, mainly, of, a, tobacco, blend, paper, pva, glue, to, bond, the, outer, layer, of, paper, together, and, often, also, a, cellulose, acetate, based, filter, while, the, assembly, of, cigarettes, is, straightforward, much, focus, is, given, to, the, creation, of, each, of, the, components, in, particular, the, tobacco, blend, a, key, ingredient, that, makes, cigarettes, more, addictive, is, the, inclusion, of, reconstituted, tobacco, which, has, additives, to, make, nicotine, more, volatile, as, the, cigarette, burns, the, paper, for, holding, the, tobacco, blend, may, vary, in, porosity, to, allow, ventilation, of, the, burning, ember, or, contain, materials, that, control, the, burning, rate, of, the, cigarette, and, stability, of, the, produced, ash, the, papers, used, in, tipping, the, cigarette, forming, the, mouthpiece, and, surrounding, the, filter, stabilize, the, mouthpiece, from, saliva, and, moderate, the, burning, of, the, cigarette, as, well, as, the, delivery, of, smoke, with, the, presence, of, one, or, two, rows, of, small, laser, drilled, air, holes, the, process, of, blending, gives, the, end, product, a, consistent, taste, from, batches, of, tobacco, grown, in, different, areas, of, a, country, that, may, change, in, flavor, profile, from, year, to, year, due, to, different, environmental, conditions, modern, cigarettes, produced, after, the, 1950s, although, composed, mainly, of, shredded, tobacco, leaf, use, a, significant, quantity, of, tobacco, processing, byproducts, in, the, blend, each, cigarette, s, tobacco, blend, is, made, mainly, from, the, leaves, of, flue, cured, brightleaf, burley, tobacco, and, oriental, tobacco, these, leaves, are, selected, processed, and, aged, prior, to, blending, and, filling, the, processing, of, brightleaf, and, burley, tobaccos, for, tobacco, leaf, strips, produces, several, byproducts, such, as, leaf, stems, tobacco, dust, and, tobacco, leaf, pieces, small, laminate, to, improve, the, economics, of, producing, cigarettes, these, byproducts, are, processed, separately, into, forms, where, they, can, then, be, added, back, into, the, cigarette, blend, without, an, apparent, or, marked, change, in, the, cigarette, s, quality, the, most, common, tobacco, byproducts, include, according, to, data, from, the, world, health, organization, the, amount, of, tobacco, per, 1000, cigarettes, fell, from, 1, 03, kg, 2, 28, pounds, in, 1960, to, 0, 41, kg, 0, 91, pounds, in, 1999, largely, as, a, result, of, reconstituting, tobacco, fluffing, and, additives, a, recipe, specified, combination, of, brightleaf, burley, leaf, and, oriental, leaf, tobacco, is, mixed, with, various, additives, to, improve, its, flavors, most, commercially, available, cigarettes, today, contain, tobacco, that, is, treated, with, sugar, to, counter, the, harshness, of, the, smoke, various, additives, are, combined, into, the, shredded, tobacco, product, mixtures, with, humectants, such, as, propylene, glycol, or, glycerol, as, well, as, flavoring, products, and, enhancers, such, as, cocoa, solids, licorice, tobacco, extracts, and, various, sugars, which, are, known, collectively, as, casings, the, leaf, tobacco, is, then, shredded, along, with, a, specified, amount, of, small, laminate, expanded, tobacco, bl, rl, es, and, is, a, perfume, like, flavor, fragrance, called, the, topping, or, toppings, which, is, most, often, formulated, by, flavor, companies, is, then, blended, into, the, tobacco, mixture, to, improve, the, consistency, in, flavor, and, taste, of, the, cigarettes, associated, with, a, certain, brand, name, additionally, they, replace, lost, flavors, due, to, the, repeated, wetting, and, drying, used, in, processing, the, tobacco, finally, the, tobacco, mixture, is, filled, into, cigarette, tubes, and, packaged, a, list, of, 599, cigarette, additives, created, by, five, major, american, cigarette, companies, was, approved, by, the, department, of, health, and, human, services, in, april, 1994, none, of, these, additives, is, listed, as, an, ingredient, on, the, cigarette, packs, chemicals, are, added, for, organoleptic, purposes, and, many, boost, the, addictive, properties, of, cigarettes, especially, when, burned, one, of, the, classes, of, chemicals, on, the, list, ammonia, salts, convert, bound, nicotine, molecules, in, tobacco, smoke, into, free, nicotine, molecules, this, process, known, as, freebasing, could, potentially, increase, the, effect, of, nicotine, on, the, smoker, but, experimental, data, suggests, that, absorption, is, in, practice, unaffected, cigarette, tubes, are, prerolled, cigarette, paper, usually, with, an, acetate, or, paper, filter, at, the, end, they, have, an, appearance, similar, to, a, finished, cigarette, but, are, without, any, tobacco, or, smoking, material, inside, the, length, varies, from, regular, 70, mm, to, king, size, 84, mm, as, well, as, 100s, 100, mm, and, 120s, 120, mm, filling, a, cigarette, tube, is, usually, done, with, a, cigarette, injector, also, known, as, a, shooter, cone, shaped, cigarette, tubes, known, as, cones, can, be, filled, using, a, packing, stick, or, straw, because, of, their, shape, cone, smoking, is, popular, because, as, the, cigarette, burns, it, tends, to, get, stronger, and, stronger, a, cone, allows, more, tobacco, to, be, burned, at, the, beginning, than, the, end, allowing, for, an, even, flavor, the, united, states, tobacco, taxation, bureau, defines, a, cigarette, tube, as, cigarette, paper, made, into, a, hollow, cylinder, for, use, in, making, cigarettes, a, cigarette, filter, or, filter, tip, is, a, component, of, a, cigarette, filters, are, typically, made, from, cellulose, acetate, fibre, most, factory, made, cigarettes, are, equipped, with, a, filter, those, who, roll, their, own, can, buy, them, separately, filters, can, reduce, some, substances, from, smoke, but, do, not, make, cigarettes, any, safer, to, smoke, in, north, america, the, common, name, for, the, remains, of, a, cigarette, after, smoking, is, a, cigarette, butt, in, britain, it, is, also, called, a, fag, end, or, a, dog, end, the, butt, is, typically, about, 30, of, the, cigarette, s, original, length, it, consists, of, a, tissue, tube, which, holds, a, filter, and, some, remains, of, tobacco, mixed, with, ash, they, are, the, most, numerically, frequent, litter, in, the, world, cigarette, butts, accumulate, outside, buildings, on, parking, lots, and, streets, where, they, can, be, transported, through, storm, drains, to, streams, rivers, and, beaches, in, a, 2013, trial, the, city, of, vancouver, british, columbia, partnered, with, terracycle, to, create, a, system, for, recycling, of, cigarette, butts, a, reward, of, 1, per, collected, butt, was, offered, to, determine, the, effectiveness, of, a, deposit, system, similar, to, that, of, beverage, containers, an, electronic, cigarette, commonly, known, as, a, vape, is, a, handheld, battery, powered, vaporizer, that, simulates, smoking, by, providing, some, of, the, behavioral, aspects, of, smoking, including, the, hand, to, mouth, action, of, smoking, but, without, combusting, tobacco, using, an, e, cigarette, is, known, as, vaping, and, the, user, is, referred, to, as, a, vaper, instead, of, cigarette, smoke, the, user, inhales, an, aerosol, commonly, called, vapor, e, cigarettes, typically, have, a, heating, element, that, atomizes, a, liquid, solution, called, e, liquid, e, cigarettes, are, automatically, activated, by, taking, a, puff, others, turn, on, manually, by, pressing, a, button, some, e, cigarettes, look, like, traditional, cigarettes, but, they, come, in, many, variations, most, versions, are, reusable, though, some, are, disposable, there, are, first, generation, second, generation, third, generation, and, fourth, generation, devices, e, liquids, usually, contain, propylene, glycol, glycerin, nicotine, flavorings, additives, and, differing, amounts, of, contaminants, e, liquids, are, also, sold, without, propylene, glycol, nicotine, or, flavors, the, benefits, and, the, health, risks, of, e, cigarettes, are, uncertain, there, is, moderate, certainty, evidence, that, e, cigarettes, with, nicotine, may, help, people, quit, smoking, when, compared, with, e, cigarettes, without, nicotine, and, nicotine, replacement, therapy, however, other, studies, have, not, supported, the, finding, that, e, cigarettes, are, proven, to, be, more, effective, than, smoking, cessation, medicine, there, is, concern, with, the, possibility, that, non, smokers, and, children, may, start, nicotine, use, with, e, cigarettes, at, a, rate, higher, than, anticipated, than, if, they, were, never, created, following, the, possibility, of, nicotine, addiction, from, e, cigarette, use, there, is, concern, children, may, start, smoking, cigarettes, youth, who, use, e, cigarettes, are, more, likely, to, go, on, to, smoke, cigarettes, their, part, in, tobacco, harm, reduction, is, unclear, while, another, review, found, they, appear, to, have, the, potential, to, lower, tobacco, related, death, and, disease, regulated, us, food, and, drug, administration, nicotine, replacement, products, may, be, safer, than, e, cigarettes, but, e, cigarettes, are, generally, seen, as, safer, than, combusted, tobacco, products, it, is, estimated, their, safety, risk, to, users, is, similar, to, that, of, smokeless, tobacco, the, long, term, effects, of, e, cigarette, use, are, unknown, the, risk, from, serious, adverse, events, was, reported, in, 2016, to, be, low, less, serious, adverse, effects, include, abdominal, pain, headache, blurry, vision, throat, and, mouth, irritation, vomiting, nausea, and, coughing, nicotine, itself, is, associated, with, some, health, harms, in, 2019, and, 2020, an, outbreak, of, severe, lung, illness, throughout, the, us, was, linked, to, the, use, of, vaping, products, e, cigarettes, create, vapor, made, of, fine, and, ultrafine, particles, of, particulate, matter, which, have, been, found, to, contain, propylene, glycol, glycerin, nicotine, flavors, small, amounts, of, toxicants, carcinogens, and, heavy, metals, as, well, as, metal, nanoparticles, and, other, substances, its, exact, composition, varies, across, and, within, manufacturers, and, depends, on, the, contents, of, the, liquid, the, physical, and, electrical, design, of, the, device, and, user, behavior, among, other, factors, e, cigarette, vapor, potentially, contains, harmful, chemicals, not, found, in, tobacco, smoke, e, cigarette, vapor, contains, fewer, toxic, chemicals, and, lower, concentrations, of, potential, toxic, chemicals, than, cigarette, smoke, the, vapor, is, probably, much, less, harmful, to, users, and, bystanders, than, cigarette, smoke, although, concern, exists, that, the, exhaled, vapor, may, be, inhaled, by, non, users, particularly, indoors, the, harm, from, smoking, comes, from, the, many, toxic, chemicals, in, the, natural, tobacco, leaf, and, those, formed, in, smoke, from, burning, tobacco, people, keep, smoking, because, the, nicotine, the, primary, psychoactive, chemical, in, cigarettes, is, highly, addictive, cigarettes, like, narcotics, have, been, described, as, strategically, addictive, with, the, addictive, properties, being, a, core, component, of, the, business, strategy, about, half, of, smokers, die, from, a, smoking, related, cause, smoking, harms, nearly, every, organ, of, the, body, smoking, leads, most, commonly, to, diseases, affecting, the, heart, liver, and, lungs, being, a, major, risk, factor, for, heart, attacks, strokes, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, including, emphysema, and, chronic, bronchitis, and, cancer, particularly, lung, cancer, cancers, of, the, larynx, and, mouth, and, pancreatic, cancer, it, also, causes, peripheral, vascular, disease, and, hypertension, children, born, to, women, who, smoke, during, pregnancy, are, at, higher, risk, of, congenital, disorders, cancer, respiratory, disease, and, sudden, death, on, average, each, cigarette, smoked, is, estimated, to, shorten, life, by, 11, minutes, starting, smoking, earlier, in, life, and, smoking, cigarettes, higher, in, tar, increases, the, risk, of, these, diseases, the, world, health, organization, estimates, that, tobacco, causes, 8, million, deaths, each, year, as, of, 2019, and, 100, million, deaths, over, the, course, of, the, 20th, century, cigarettes, produce, an, aerosol, containing, over, 4, 000, chemical, compounds, including, nicotine, carbon, monoxide, acrolein, and, oxidant, substances, over, 70, of, these, are, carcinogens, the, most, important, chemical, compounds, causing, cancer, are, those, that, produce, dna, damage, since, such, damage, appears, to, be, the, primary, underlying, cause, of, cancer, cunningham, et, al, combined, the, microgram, weight, of, the, compound, in, the, smoke, of, one, cigarette, with, the, known, genotoxic, effect, per, microgram, to, identify, the, most, carcinogenic, compounds, in, cigarette, smoke, the, seven, most, important, carcinogens, in, tobacco, smoke, are, shown, in, the, table, along, with, dna, alterations, they, cause, ages, 15, millions, and, future, smokers, younger, than, 35, unless, they, quit, millions, 2008, ulcerative, colitis, is, a, condition, of, nonsmokers, in, which, nicotine, is, of, therapeutic, benefit, a, recent, review, of, the, available, scientific, literature, concluded, that, the, apparent, decrease, in, alzheimer, disease, risk, may, be, simply, because, smokers, tend, to, die, before, reaching, the, age, at, which, it, normally, occurs, differential, mortality, is, always, likely, to, be, a, problem, where, there, is, a, need, to, investigate, the, effects, of, smoking, in, a, disorder, with, very, low, incidence, rates, before, age, 75, years, which, is, the, case, of, alzheimer, s, disease, it, stated, noting, that, smokers, are, only, half, as, likely, as, nonsmokers, to, survive, to, the, age, of, 80, a, very, strong, argument, has, been, made, about, the, association, between, adolescent, exposure, to, nicotine, by, smoking, conventional, cigarettes, and, the, subsequent, onset, of, using, other, dependence, producing, substances, strong, temporal, and, dose, dependent, associations, have, been, reported, and, a, plausible, biological, mechanism, via, rodent, and, human, modeling, suggests, that, long, term, changes, in, the, neural, reward, system, take, place, as, a, result, of, adolescent, smoking, adolescent, smokers, of, conventional, cigarettes, have, disproportionately, high, rates, of, comorbid, substance, use, and, longitudinal, studies, have, suggested, that, early, adolescent, smoking, may, be, a, starting, point, or, gateway, for, substance, use, later, in, life, with, this, effect, more, likely, for, persons, with, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, although, factors, such, as, genetic, comorbidity, innate, propensity, for, risk, taking, and, social, influences, may, underlie, these, findings, both, human, neuroimaging, and, animal, studies, suggest, a, neurobiological, mechanism, also, plays, a, role, in, addition, behavioral, studies, in, adolescent, and, young, adult, smokers, have, revealed, an, increased, propensity, for, risk, taking, both, generally, and, in, the, presence, of, peers, and, neuroimaging, studies, have, shown, altered, frontal, neural, activation, during, a, risk, taking, task, as, compared, with, nonsmokers, in, 2011, rubinstein, and, colleagues, used, neuroimaging, to, show, decreased, brain, response, to, a, natural, reinforcer, pleasurable, food, cues, in, adolescent, light, smokers, 1, 5, cigarettes, per, day, with, their, results, highlighting, the, possibility, of, neural, alterations, consistent, with, nicotine, dependence, and, altered, brain, response, to, reward, even, in, adolescent, low, level, smokers, second, hand, smoke, is, a, mixture, of, smoke, from, the, burning, end, of, a, cigarette, and, the, smoke, exhaled, from, the, lungs, of, smokers, it, is, involuntarily, inhaled, lingers, in, the, air, for, hours, after, cigarettes, have, been, extinguished, and, can, cause, a, wide, range, of, adverse, health, effects, including, cancer, respiratory, infections, and, asthma, nonsmokers, who, are, exposed, to, second, hand, smoke, at, home, or, work, increase, their, heart, disease, risk, by, 25, 30, and, their, lung, cancer, risk, by, 20, 30, second, hand, smoke, has, been, estimated, to, cause, 38, 000, deaths, per, year, of, which, 3, 400, are, deaths, from, lung, cancer, in, nonsmokers, sudden, infant, death, syndrome, ear, infections, respiratory, infections, and, asthma, attacks, can, occur, in, children, who, are, exposed, to, second, hand, smoke, scientific, evidence, shows, that, no, level, of, exposure, to, second, hand, smoke, is, safe, many, governments, impose, restrictions, on, smoking, tobacco, especially, in, public, areas, the, primary, justification, has, been, the, negative, health, effects, of, second, hand, smoke, laws, vary, by, country, and, locality, nearly, all, countries, have, laws, restricting, places, where, people, can, smoke, in, public, and, over, 40, countries, have, comprehensive, smoke, free, laws, that, prohibit, smoking, in, virtually, all, public, venues, in, the, united, states, the, age, to, buy, tobacco, products, is, 21, in, all, states, as, of, 2020, similar, laws, exist, in, many, other, countries, in, canada, most, of, the, provinces, require, smokers, to, be, 19, years, of, age, to, purchase, cigarettes, except, for, quebec, and, the, prairie, provinces, where, the, age, is, 18, however, the, minimum, age, only, concerns, the, purchase, of, tobacco, not, use, alberta, however, does, have, a, law, which, prohibits, the, possession, or, use, of, tobacco, products, by, all, persons, under, 18, punishable, by, a, 100, fine, australia, new, zealand, poland, and, pakistan, have, a, nationwide, ban, on, the, selling, of, all, tobacco, products, to, people, under, the, age, of, 18, since, october, 1, 2007, it, has, been, illegal, for, retailers, to, sell, tobacco, in, all, forms, to, people, under, the, age, of, 18, in, three, of, the, uk, s, four, constituent, countries, england, wales, northern, ireland, and, scotland, rising, from, 16, it, is, also, illegal, to, sell, lighters, rolling, papers, and, all, other, tobacco, associated, items, to, people, under, 18, it, is, not, illegal, for, people, under, 18, to, buy, or, smoke, tobacco, just, as, it, was, not, previously, for, people, under, 16, it, is, only, illegal, for, the, said, retailer, to, sell, the, item, the, age, increase, from, 16, to, 18, came, into, force, in, northern, ireland, on, september, 1, 2008, in, the, republic, of, ireland, bans, on, the, sale, of, the, smaller, 10, packs, and, confectionery, that, resembles, tobacco, products, candy, cigarettes, came, into, force, on, may, 31, 2007, in, a, bid, to, cut, underaged, smoking, in, october, 2023, it, was, announced, that, the, government, proposed, introducing, a, ban, on, sales, of, cigarettes, to, anyone, born, after, 2008, most, countries, in, the, world, have, a, legal, vending, age, of, 18, in, north, macedonia, italy, malta, austria, luxembourg, and, belgium, the, age, for, legal, vending, is, 16, since, january, 1, 2007, all, cigarette, machines, in, public, places, in, germany, must, attempt, to, verify, a, customer, s, age, by, requiring, the, insertion, of, a, debit, card, turkey, which, has, one, of, the, highest, percentage, of, smokers, in, its, population, has, a, legal, age, of, 18, japan, is, one, of, the, highest, tobacco, consuming, nations, and, requires, purchasers, to, be, 20, years, of, age, since, july, 2008, japan, has, enforced, this, age, limit, at, cigarette, vending, machines, through, use, of, the, taspo, smart, card, in, other, countries, such, as, egypt, it, is, legal, to, use, and, purchase, tobacco, products, regardless, of, age, germany, raised, the, purchase, age, from, 16, to, 18, on, september, 1, 2007, some, police, departments, in, the, united, states, occasionally, send, an, underaged, teenager, into, a, store, where, cigarettes, are, sold, and, have, the, teen, attempt, to, purchase, cigarettes, with, their, own, or, no, id, if, the, vendor, then, completes, the, sale, the, store, is, issued, a, fine, similar, enforcement, practices, are, regularly, performed, by, trading, standards, officers, in, the, uk, israel, and, the, republic, of, ireland, cigarettes, are, taxed, both, to, reduce, use, especially, among, youth, and, to, raise, revenue, higher, prices, for, cigarettes, discourage, smoking, every, 10, increase, in, the, price, of, cigarettes, reduces, youth, smoking, by, about, 7, and, overall, cigarette, consumption, by, about, 4, the, world, health, organization, who, recommends, that, globally, cigarettes, be, taxed, at, a, rate, of, three, quarters, of, cigarettes, sale, price, as, a, way, of, deterring, cancer, and, other, negative, health, outcomes, cigarette, sales, are, a, significant, source, of, tax, revenue, in, many, localities, this, fact, has, historically, been, an, impediment, for, health, groups, seeking, to, discourage, cigarette, smoking, since, governments, seek, to, maximize, tax, revenues, furthermore, some, countries, have, made, cigarettes, a, state, monopoly, which, has, the, same, effect, on, the, attitude, of, government, officials, outside, the, health, field, in, the, united, states, states, are, a, primary, determinant, of, the, total, tax, rate, on, cigarettes, generally, states, that, rely, on, tobacco, as, a, significant, farm, product, tend, to, tax, cigarettes, at, a, low, rate, coupled, with, the, federal, cigarette, tax, of, 1, 01, per, pack, total, cigarette, specific, taxes, range, from, 1, 18, per, pack, in, missouri, to, 8, 00, per, pack, in, silver, bay, new, york, as, part, of, the, family, smoking, prevention, and, tobacco, control, act, the, federal, government, collects, user, fees, to, fund, food, and, drug, administration, fda, regulatory, measures, over, tobacco, cigarettes, are, a, frequent, source, of, deadly, fires, in, private, homes, which, prompted, both, the, european, union, and, the, united, states, to, require, cigarettes, to, be, fire, standard, compliant, according, to, simon, chapman, a, professor, of, public, health, at, the, university, of, sydney, reduction, of, burning, agents, in, cigarettes, would, be, a, simple, and, effective, means, of, dramatically, reducing, the, ignition, propensity, of, cigarettes, since, the, 1980s, prominent, cigarette, manufacturers, such, as, philip, morris, and, r, j, reynolds, have, developed, fire, safe, cigarettes, but, phillip, morris, was, later, the, subject, of, a, government, lawsuit, for, allegedly, hiding, the, even, greater, dangers, associated, with, their, brand, of, such, cigarettes, the, burn, rate, of, cigarette, paper, is, regulated, through, the, application, of, different, forms, of, microcrystalline, cellulose, to, the, paper, cigarette, paper, has, been, specially, engineered, by, creating, bands, of, different, porosity, to, create, fire, safe, cigarettes, these, cigarettes, have, a, reduced, idle, burning, speed, which, allows, them, to, self, extinguish, this, fire, safe, paper, is, manufactured, by, mechanically, altering, the, setting, of, the, paper, slurry, new, york, was, the, first, u, s, state, to, mandate, that, all, cigarettes, manufactured, or, sold, within, the, state, comply, with, a, fire, safe, standard, canada, has, passed, a, similar, nationwide, mandate, based, on, the, same, standard, all, u, s, states, are, gradually, passing, fire, safe, mandates, the, european, union, in, 2011, banned, cigarettes, that, do, not, meet, a, fire, safety, standard, according, to, a, study, made, by, the, european, union, in, 16, european, countries, 11, 000, fires, were, due, to, people, carelessly, handling, cigarettes, between, 2005, and, 2007, this, caused, 520, deaths, with, 1, 600, people, injured, many, countries, have, restrictions, on, cigarette, advertising, promotion, sponsorship, and, marketing, for, example, in, the, canadian, provinces, of, british, columbia, saskatchewan, and, alberta, the, retail, store, display, of, cigarettes, is, completely, prohibited, if, persons, under, the, legal, age, of, consumption, have, access, to, the, premises, in, ontario, manitoba, newfoundland, and, labrador, and, quebec, canada, and, the, australian, capital, territory, the, display, of, tobacco, is, prohibited, for, everyone, regardless, of, age, as, of, 2010, this, retail, display, ban, includes, noncigarette, products, such, as, cigars, and, blunt, wraps, as, a, result, of, tight, advertising, and, marketing, prohibitions, tobacco, companies, look, at, the, pack, differently, they, view, it, as, a, strong, component, in, displaying, brand, imagery, and, a, creating, significant, in, store, presence, at, the, point, of, purchase, market, testing, shows, the, influence, of, this, dimension, in, shifting, the, consumer, s, choice, when, the, same, product, displays, in, an, alternative, package, companies, have, manipulated, a, variety, of, elements, in, packs, designs, to, communicate, the, impression, of, lower, in, tar, or, milder, cigarettes, whereas, the, components, were, the, same, some, countries, require, cigarette, packs, to, contain, warnings, about, health, hazards, the, united, states, was, the, first, later, followed, by, other, countries, including, canada, most, of, europe, australia, pakistan, india, hong, kong, and, singapore, in, 1985, iceland, became, the, first, country, to, enforce, graphic, warnings, on, cigarette, packaging, at, the, end, of, december, 2010, new, regulations, from, ottawa, increased, the, size, of, tobacco, warnings, to, cover, three, quarters, of, the, cigarette, package, in, canada, as, of, november, 2010, 39, countries, have, adopted, similar, legislation, in, february, 2011, the, canadian, government, passed, regulations, requiring, cigarette, packs, to, contain, 12, new, images, to, cover, 75, of, the, outside, panel, and, eight, new, health, messages, on, the, inside, panel, with, full, color, as, of, april, 2011, australian, regulations, require, all, packs, to, use, a, bland, olive, green, that, researchers, determined, to, be, the, least, attractive, color, with, 75, coverage, on, the, front, of, the, pack, and, all, of, the, back, consisting, of, graphic, health, warnings, the, only, feature, that, differentiates, one, brand, from, another, is, the, product, name, in, a, standard, color, position, font, size, and, style, similar, policies, have, since, been, adopted, in, france, and, the, united, kingdom, in, response, to, these, regulations, philip, morris, international, japan, tobacco, inc, british, american, tobacco, plc, and, imperial, tobacco, attempted, to, sue, the, australian, government, on, august, 15, 2012, the, high, court, of, australia, dismissed, the, suit, and, made, australia, the, first, country, to, introduce, brand, free, plain, cigarette, packaging, with, health, warnings, covering, 90, and, 70, of, back, and, front, packaging, respectively, this, took, effect, on, december, 1, 2012, a, few, countries, have, outlawed, tobacco, completely, or, made, plans, to, do, so, in, 2004, bhutan, became, the, first, country, in, the, world, to, completely, outlaw, the, cultivation, harvesting, production, and, sale, of, tobacco, and, tobacco, products, enforcement, of, the, prohibition, increased, with, the, passage, of, the, tobacco, control, act, of, bhutan, 2010, however, small, allowances, for, personal, possession, are, permitted, as, long, as, the, possessors, can, prove, that, they, have, paid, import, duties, the, pitcairn, islands, had, previously, banned, the, sale, of, cigarettes, but, it, now, permits, sales, from, a, government, run, store, the, pacific, island, of, niue, hopes, to, become, the, next, country, to, prohibit, the, sale, of, tobacco, iceland, is, also, proposing, banning, tobacco, sales, from, shops, making, it, prescription, only, and, therefore, dispensable, only, in, pharmacies, on, doctor, s, orders, singapore, and, the, australian, state, of, tasmania, have, proposed, a, tobacco, free, millennium, generation, initiative, by, banning, the, sale, of, all, tobacco, products, to, anyone, born, in, and, after, the, year, 2000, in, march, 2012, brazil, became, the, world, s, first, country, to, ban, all, flavored, tobacco, including, menthols, it, also, banned, the, majority, of, the, estimated, 600, additives, used, permitting, only, eight, this, regulation, applies, to, domestic, and, imported, cigarettes, tobacco, manufacturers, had, 18, months, to, remove, the, noncompliant, cigarettes, 24, months, to, remove, the, other, forms, of, noncompliant, tobacco, under, sharia, law, the, consumption, of, cigarettes, by, muslims, is, prohibited, cigarette, filters, are, made, up, of, thousands, of, polymer, chains, of, cellulose, acetate, which, has, the, chemical, structure, shown, to, the, right, once, discarded, into, the, environment, the, filters, create, a, large, waste, problem, cigarette, filters, are, the, most, common, form, of, litter, in, the, world, as, approximately, 5, 6, trillion, cigarettes, are, smoked, every, year, worldwide, of, those, an, estimated, 4, 5, trillion, cigarette, filters, become, litter, every, year, to, develop, an, idea, of, the, waste, weight, amount, produced, a, year, the, table, below, was, created, discarded, cigarette, filters, usually, end, up, in, the, water, system, through, drainage, ditches, and, are, transported, by, rivers, and, other, waterways, to, the, ocean, in, the, 2006, international, coastal, cleanup, cigarettes, and, cigarette, butts, constituted, 24, 7, of, the, total, collected, pieces, of, garbage, over, twice, as, many, as, any, other, category, which, is, not, surprising, seeing, the, numbers, in, the, table, above, of, waste, produced, each, year, cigarette, filters, contain, the, chemicals, filtered, from, cigarettes, and, can, leach, into, waterways, and, water, supplies, the, toxicity, of, used, cigarette, filters, depends, on, the, specific, tobacco, blend, and, additives, used, by, the, cigarette, companies, after, a, cigarette, is, smoked, the, filter, retains, some, of, the, chemicals, and, some, of, those, are, considered, carcinogenic, when, studying, the, environmental, effects, of, cigarette, filters, the, various, chemicals, that, can, be, found, in, cigarette, filters, are, not, studied, individually, due, to, the, complexity, of, doing, so, researchers, instead, focus, on, the, whole, cigarette, filter, and, its, ld, 50, ld, 50, is, defined, as, the, lethal, dose, that, kills, 50, of, a, sample, population, this, allows, for, a, simpler, study, of, the, toxicity, of, cigarette, filters, one, recent, study, has, looked, at, the, toxicity, of, smoked, cigarette, filters, smoked, filter, tobacco, smoked, cigarette, filters, no, tobacco, and, unsmoked, cigarette, filters, no, tobacco, the, results, of, the, study, showed, that, for, the, ld, 50, of, both, marine, topsmelt, atherinops, affinis, and, freshwater, fathead, minnow, pimephales, promelas, smoked, cigarette, filters, tobacco, are, more, toxic, than, smoked, cigarette, filters, but, both, are, severely, more, toxic, than, unsmoked, cigarette, filters, toxic, chemicals, are, not, the, only, human, health, concern, to, take, into, considerations, the, others, are, cellulose, acetate, and, carbon, particles, that, are, breathed, in, while, smoking, these, particles, are, suspected, of, causing, lung, damage, the, next, health, concern, is, that, of, plants, under, certain, growing, conditions, plants, on, average, grow, taller, and, have, longer, roots, than, those, exposed, to, cigarette, filters, in, the, soil, a, connection, exists, between, cigarette, filters, introduced, to, soil, and, the, depletion, of, some, soil, nutrients, over, time, another, health, concern, to, the, environment, is, not, only, the, toxic, carcinogens, that, are, harmful, to, the, wildlife, but, also, the, filters, themselves, pose, an, ingestion, risk, to, wildlife, that, may, presume, filter, litter, as, food, the, last, major, health, concern, to, make, note, of, for, marine, life, is, the, toxicity, that, deep, marine, topsmelt, and, fathead, minnow, pose, to, their, predators, this, could, lead, to, toxin, build, up, bioaccumulation, in, the, food, chain, and, have, long, reaching, negative, effects, smoldering, cigarette, filters, have, also, been, blamed, for, triggering, fires, from, residential, areas, to, major, wildfires, and, bushfires, which, has, caused, major, property, damage, and, also, death, as, well, as, disruption, to, services, by, triggering, alarms, and, warning, systems, once, in, the, environment, cellulose, acetate, can, go, through, biodegradation, and, photodegradation, several, factors, go, into, determining, the, rate, of, each, degradation, process, this, variance, in, rate, and, resistance, to, biodegradation, in, many, conditions, is, a, factor, in, littering, and, environmental, damage, the, first, step, in, the, biodegradation, of, cellulose, acetate, is, the, deactylation, of, the, acetate, from, the, polymer, chain, which, is, the, opposite, of, acetylation, an, acetate, is, a, negative, ion, with, the, chemical, formula, of, c, 2, h, 3, o, 2, deacetylation, can, be, performed, by, either, chemical, hydrolysis, or, acetylesterase, chemical, hydrolysis, is, the, cleavage, of, a, chemical, bond, by, addition, of, water, in, the, reaction, water, h, 2, o, reacts, with, the, acetic, ester, functional, group, attached, the, cellulose, polymer, chain, and, forms, an, alcohol, and, acetate, the, alcohol, is, simply, the, cellulose, polymer, chain, with, the, acetate, replaced, with, an, alcohol, group, the, second, reaction, is, exactly, the, same, as, chemical, hydrolysis, with, the, exception, of, the, use, of, an, acetylesterase, enzyme, the, enzyme, found, in, most, plants, catalyzes, the, chemical, reaction, shown, below, in, the, case, of, the, enzymatic, reaction, the, two, substrates, reactants, are, again, acetic, ester, and, h, 2, o, the, two, products, of, the, reaction, are, alcohol, and, acetate, this, reaction, is, exactly, the, same, as, the, chemical, hydrolysis, both, of, these, products, are, perfectly, fine, in, the, environment, once, the, acetate, group, is, removed, from, the, cellulose, chain, the, polymer, can, be, readily, degraded, by, cellulase, which, is, another, enzyme, found, in, fungi, bacteria, and, protozoans, cellulases, break, down, the, cellulose, molecule, into, monosaccharides, simple, sugars, such, as, beta, glucose, or, shorter, polysaccharides, and, oligosaccharides, these, simple, sugars, are, not, harmful, to, the, environment, and, are, in, fact, are, a, useful, product, for, many, plants, and, animals, the, breakdown, of, cellulose, is, of, interest, in, the, field, of, biofuel, due, to, the, conditions, that, affect, the, process, large, variation, in, the, degradation, time, of, cellulose, acetate, occurs, the, duration, of, the, biodegradation, process, is, cited, as, taking, as, little, as, one, month, to, as, long, as, 15, years, or, more, depending, on, the, environmental, conditions, the, major, factor, that, affects, the, biodegradation, duration, is, the, availability, of, acetylesterase, and, cellulase, enzymes, without, these, enzymes, biodegradation, only, occurs, through, chemical, hydrolysis, and, stops, there, temperature, is, another, major, factor, if, the, organisms, that, contain, the, enzymes, are, too, cold, to, grow, then, biodegradation, is, severely, hindered, availability, of, oxygen, in, the, environment, also, affects, the, degradation, cellulose, acetate, is, degraded, within, 2, 3, weeks, under, aerobic, assay, systems, of, in, vitro, enrichment, cultivation, techniques, and, an, activated, sludge, wastewater, treatment, system, it, is, degraded, within, 14, weeks, under, anaerobic, conditions, of, incubation, with, special, cultures, of, fungi, ideal, conditions, were, used, for, the, degradation, i, e, a, suitable, temperature, and, available, organisms, to, provide, the, enzymes, thus, filters, last, longer, in, places, with, low, oxygen, concentration, such, as, swamps, and, bogs, overall, the, biodegradation, process, of, cellulose, acetate, is, not, an, instantaneous, process, the, other, process, of, degradation, is, photodegradation, which, is, when, a, molecular, bond, is, broken, by, the, absorption, of, photon, radiation, i, e, light, due, to, cellulose, acetate, carbonyl, groups, the, molecule, naturally, absorbs, light, at, 260, nm, but, it, contains, some, impurities, which, can, absorb, light, these, impurities, are, known, to, absorb, light, in, the, far, uv, light, region, 280, nm, the, atmosphere, filters, radiation, from, the, sun, and, allows, radiation, of, 300, nm, only, to, reach, the, surface, thus, the, primary, photodegradation, of, cellulose, acetate, is, considered, insignificant, to, the, total, degradation, process, since, cellulose, acetate, and, its, impurities, absorb, light, at, shorter, wavelengths, research, is, focused, on, the, secondary, mechanisms, of, photodegradation, of, cellulose, acetate, to, help, make, up, for, some, of, the, limitations, of, biodegradation, the, secondary, mechanisms, would, be, the, addition, of, a, compound, to, the, filters, that, would, be, able, to, absorb, natural, light, and, use, it, to, start, the, degradation, process, the, main, two, areas, of, research, are, in, photocatalytic, oxidation, and, photosensitized, degradation, photocatalytic, oxidation, uses, a, species, that, absorbs, radiation, and, creates, hydroxyl, radicals, that, react, with, the, filters, and, start, the, breakdown, photosensitized, degradation, though, uses, a, species, that, absorbs, radiation, and, transfers, the, energy, to, the, cellulose, acetate, to, start, the, degradation, process, both, processes, use, other, species, that, absorbed, light, 300, nm, to, start, the, degradation, of, cellulose, acetate, several, options, are, available, to, help, reduce, the, environmental, effects, of, cigarette, butts, proper, disposal, into, receptacles, leads, to, decreased, numbers, found, in, the, environment, and, their, effect, on, the, environment, another, method, is, making, fines, and, penalties, for, littering, filters, many, governments, have, sanctioned, stiff, penalties, for, littering, of, cigarette, filters, for, example, washington, imposes, a, penalty, of, 1, 025, for, littering, cigarette, filters, another, option, is, developing, better, biodegradable, filters, much, of, this, work, relies, heavily, on, the, research, in, the, secondary, mechanism, for, photodegradation, as, stated, above, but, a, new, research, group, has, developed, an, acid, tablet, that, goes, inside, the, filters, and, once, wet, enough, releases, acid, that, speeds, up, the, degradation, to, around, two, weeks, the, research, is, still, only, in, test, phase, and, the, hope, is, soon, it, will, go, into, production, the, next, option, is, using, cigarette, packs, with, a, compartment, in, which, to, discard, cigarette, butts, implementing, monetary, deposits, on, filters, increasing, the, availability, of, butt, receptacles, and, expanding, public, education, it, may, even, be, possible, to, ban, the, sale, of, filtered, cigarettes, altogether, on, the, basis, of, their, adverse, environmental, effects, recent, research, has, been, put, into, finding, ways, to, use, the, filter, waste, to, develop, a, desired, product, one, research, group, in, south, korea, has, developed, a, simple, one, step, process, that, converts, the, cellulose, acetate, in, discarded, cigarette, filters, into, a, high, performing, material, that, could, be, integrated, into, computers, handheld, devices, electrical, vehicles, and, wind, turbines, to, store, energy, these, materials, have, demonstrated, superior, performance, as, compared, to, commercially, available, carbon, grapheme, and, carbon, nanotubes, the, product, is, showing, high, promise, as, a, green, alternative, for, the, waste, problem, smoking, has, become, less, popular, but, is, still, a, large, public, health, problem, globally, worldwide, smoking, rates, fell, from, 41, in, 1980, to, 31, in, 2012, although, the, actual, number, of, smokers, increased, because, of, population, growth, in, 2017, 5, 4, trillion, cigarettes, were, produced, globally, and, were, smoked, by, almost, 1, billion, people, smoking, rates, have, leveled, off, or, declined, in, most, countries, but, is, increasing, in, some, low, and, middle, income, countries, the, significant, reductions, in, smoking, rates, in, the, united, states, united, kingdom, australia, brazil, and, other, countries, that, implemented, strong, tobacco, control, programs, have, been, offset, by, the, increasing, consumption, in, low, income, countries, especially, china, the, chinese, market, now, consumes, more, cigarettes, than, all, other, low, and, middle, income, countries, combined, other, regions, are, increasingly, playing, larger, roles, in, the, growing, global, smoking, epidemic, the, who, eastern, mediterranean, region, emro, now, has, the, highest, growth, rate, in, the, cigarette, market, with, more, than, a, one, third, increase, in, cigarette, consumption, since, 2000, due, to, its, recent, dynamic, economic, development, and, continued, population, growth, africa, presents, the, greatest, risk, in, terms, of, future, growth, in, tobacco, use, within, countries, patterns, of, cigarette, consumption, also, can, vary, widely, for, example, in, many, of, the, countries, where, few, women, smoke, smoking, rates, are, often, high, in, males, e, g, in, asia, by, contrast, in, most, developed, countries,
