xiphosura, z, f, o, sj, r, from, ancient, greek, x, phos, sword, and, our, tail, in, reference, to, its, sword, like, telson, is, an, order, of, arthropods, related, to, arachnids, they, are, more, commonly, known, as, horseshoe, crabs, a, name, applied, more, specifically, to, the, only, extant, family, limulidae, they, first, appeared, in, the, hirnantian, late, ordovician, currently, there, are, only, four, living, species, xiphosura, contains, one, suborder, xiphosurida, and, several, stem, genera, the, group, has, hardly, changed, in, appearance, in, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, the, modern, horseshoe, crabs, look, almost, identical, to, prehistoric, genera, and, are, considered, to, be, living, fossils, the, most, notable, difference, between, ancient, and, modern, forms, is, that, the, abdominal, segments, in, present, species, are, fused, into, a, single, unit, in, adults, xiphosura, were, historically, placed, in, the, class, merostomata, although, this, term, was, intended, to, encompass, also, the, eurypterids, whence, it, denoted, what, is, now, known, to, be, an, unnatural, paraphyletic, group, although, this, is, a, grouping, recovered, in, some, recent, cladistic, analyses, although, the, name, merostomata, is, still, seen, in, textbooks, without, reference, to, the, eurypterida, some, have, urged, that, this, usage, should, be, discouraged, the, merostomata, label, originally, did, not, include, eurypterida, although, they, were, added, in, as, a, better, understanding, of, the, extinct, group, evolved, now, eurypterida, is, classified, within, sclerophorata, together, with, the, arachnids, and, therefore, merostomata, is, now, a, synonym, of, xiphosura, several, recent, phylogenomic, studies, place, xiphosura, within, arachnida, often, as, the, sister, group, of, ricinulei, included, among, them, are, taxonomically, comprehensive, analyses, of, both, morphology, and, genomes, which, have, recovered, merostomata, as, a, derived, clade, of, arachnids, modern, xiphosurans, reach, up, to, 60, cm, 24, in, in, adult, length, but, the, paleozoic, species, were, often, far, smaller, some, as, small, as, 1, to, 3, cm, 0, 39, to, 1, 18, in, long, their, bodies, are, divided, into, an, anterior, prosoma, and, a, posterior, opisthosoma, or, abdomen, the, upper, surface, of, the, prosoma, is, covered, by, a, semicircular, carapace, while, the, underside, bears, five, pairs, of, walking, legs, and, a, pair, of, pincer, like, chelicerae, the, mouth, is, located, on, underside, of, the, center, of, the, prosoma, between, the, bases, of, the, walking, legs, and, lies, behind, a, lip, like, structure, called, the, labrum, the, exoskeleton, consist, of, a, tough, cuticle, but, do, not, contain, any, crystalline, biominerals, like, scorpions, xiphosurans, have, an, exocuticular, layer, of, hyaline, which, exhibits, uv, fluorescence, xiphosurans, have, up, to, four, eyes, located, in, the, carapace, two, compound, eyes, are, on, the, side, of, the, prosoma, with, one, or, two, median, ocelli, towards, the, front, the, compound, eyes, are, simpler, in, structure, than, those, of, other, arthropods, with, the, individual, ommatidia, not, being, arranged, in, a, compact, pattern, they, can, probably, detect, movement, but, are, unlikely, to, be, able, to, form, a, true, image, in, front, of, the, ocelli, is, an, additional, organ, that, probably, functions, as, a, chemoreceptor, the, first, four, pairs, of, legs, end, in, pincers, and, have, a, series, of, spines, called, the, gnathobase, on, the, inner, surface, the, spines, are, used, to, masticate, the, food, tearing, it, up, before, passing, it, to, the, mouth, the, fifth, and, final, pair, of, legs, however, has, no, pincers, or, spines, instead, having, structures, for, cleaning, the, gills, and, pushing, mud, out, of, the, way, while, burrowing, behind, the, walking, legs, is, a, sixth, set, of, appendages, the, chilaria, which, are, greatly, reduced, in, size, and, covered, in, hairs, and, spines, these, are, thought, to, be, vestiges, of, the, limbs, of, an, absorbed, first, opisthosomal, segment, the, opisthosoma, is, divided, into, a, forward, mesosoma, with, flattened, appendages, and, a, metasoma, at, the, rear, which, has, no, appendages, in, modern, forms, the, whole, of, the, opisthosoma, is, fused, into, a, single, unsegmented, structure, the, underside, of, the, opisthosoma, carries, the, genital, openings, and, five, pairs, of, flap, like, gills, the, opisthosoma, terminates, in, a, long, caudal, spine, commonly, referred, to, as, a, telson, though, this, same, term, is, also, used, for, a, different, structure, in, crustaceans, the, spine, is, highly, mobile, and, is, used, to, push, the, animal, upright, if, it, is, accidentally, turned, over, the, mouth, opens, into, a, sclerotised, oesophagus, which, leads, to, a, crop, and, gizzard, after, grinding, up, its, food, in, the, gizzard, the, animal, regurgitates, any, inedible, portions, and, passes, the, remainder, to, the, true, stomach, the, stomach, secretes, digestive, enzymes, and, is, attached, to, an, intestine, and, two, large, caeca, that, extend, through, much, of, the, body, and, absorb, the, nutrients, from, the, food, the, intestine, terminates, in, a, sclerotised, rectum, which, opens, just, in, front, of, the, base, of, the, caudal, spine, xiphosurans, have, well, developed, circulatory, systems, with, numerous, arteries, that, send, blood, from, the, long, tubular, heart, to, the, body, tissues, and, then, to, two, longitudinal, sinuses, next, to, the, gills, after, being, oxygenated, the, blood, flows, into, the, body, cavity, and, back, to, the, heart, the, blood, contains, haemocyanin, a, blue, copper, based, pigment, performing, the, same, function, as, haemoglobin, in, vertebrates, and, also, has, blood, cells, that, aid, in, clotting, the, excretory, system, consists, of, two, pairs, of, coxal, glands, connected, to, a, bladder, that, opens, near, the, base, of, the, last, pair, of, walking, legs, the, brain, is, relatively, large, and, as, in, many, arthropods, surrounds, the, oesophagus, in, both, sexes, the, single, gonad, lies, next, to, the, intestine, and, opens, on, the, underside, of, the, opisthosoma, xiphosurans, move, to, shallow, water, to, mate, the, male, climbs, onto, the, back, of, the, female, gripping, her, with, his, first, pair, of, walking, legs, the, female, digs, out, a, depression, in, the, sand, and, lays, from, 200, to, 300, eggs, which, the, male, covers, with, sperm, the, pair, then, separates, and, the, female, buries, the, eggs, the, egg, is, about, 2, 3, mm, 0, 08, 0, 12, in, across, inside, the, egg, the, embryo, goes, through, four, molts, before, it, hatches, into, a, larva, often, called, a, trilobite, larva, due, to, its, superficial, resemblance, to, a, trilobite, at, this, stage, it, has, no, telson, yet, and, the, larva, is, lecithotrophic, non, feeding, and, planktonic, subsisting, on, the, maternal, yolk, before, settling, to, the, bottom, to, molt, after, which, the, telson, first, appears, through, a, series, of, successive, moults, the, larva, develops, additional, gills, increases, the, length, of, its, caudal, spine, and, gradually, assumes, the, adult, form, modern, xiphosurans, reach, sexual, maturity, after, about, three, years, of, growth, the, oldest, known, stem, xiphosuran, lunataspis, is, known, from, the, late, ordovician, of, canada, around, 445, million, years, ago, no, xiphosurans, are, known, from, the, following, silurian, xiphosurida, first, appears, during, the, late, devonian, a, major, radiation, of, freshwater, xiphosurids, the, belinuridae, is, known, from, the, carboniferous, with, the, oldest, representatives, of, the, modern, family, limulidae, also, possibly, appearing, during, this, time, though, they, only, appear, in, abundance, during, the, triassic, another, major, radiation, of, freshwater, xiphosurans, the, austrolimulidae, is, known, from, the, permian, and, triassic, all, extant, species, are, estimated, to, have, diverged, from, a, common, ancestor, that, lived, about, 135, million, years, ago, in, the, early, cretaceous, as, a, group, they, have, never, showed, much, diversity, in, regard, of, species, less, than, 50, fossil, species, are, known, from, the, carboniferous, period, when, they, were, at, their, most, diverse, xiphosuran, classification, as, of, 2018, order, xiphosura, latreille, 1802, two, groups, were,
