see, text, equisetum, k, w, s, i, t, m, horsetail, marestail, snake, grass, puzzlegrass, is, the, only, living, genus, in, equisetaceae, a, family, of, vascular, plants, that, reproduce, by, spores, rather, than, seeds, equisetum, is, a, living, fossil, the, only, living, genus, of, the, entire, subclass, equisetidae, which, for, over, 100, million, years, was, much, more, diverse, and, dominated, the, understorey, of, late, paleozoic, forests, some, equisetids, were, large, trees, reaching, to, 30, m, 98, ft, tall, the, genus, calamites, of, the, family, calamitaceae, for, example, is, abundant, in, coal, deposits, from, the, carboniferous, period, the, pattern, of, spacing, of, nodes, in, horsetails, wherein, those, toward, the, apex, of, the, shoot, are, increasingly, close, together, is, said, to, have, inspired, john, napier, to, invent, logarithms, modern, horsetails, first, appeared, during, the, jurassic, period, a, superficially, similar, but, entirely, unrelated, flowering, plant, genus, mare, s, tail, hippuris, is, occasionally, referred, to, as, horsetail, and, adding, to, confusion, the, name, mare, s, tail, is, sometimes, applied, to, equisetum, the, name, horsetail, often, used, for, the, entire, group, arose, because, the, branched, species, somewhat, resemble, a, horse, s, tail, similarly, the, scientific, name, equisetum, is, derived, from, the, latin, equus, horse, seta, bristle, other, names, include, candock, for, branching, species, and, snake, grass, or, scouring, rush, for, unbranched, or, sparsely, branched, species, the, latter, name, refers, to, the, rush, like, appearance, of, the, plants, and, to, the, fact, that, the, stems, are, coated, with, abrasive, silicates, making, them, useful, for, scouring, cleaning, metal, items, such, as, cooking, pots, or, drinking, mugs, particularly, those, made, of, tin, equisetum, hyemale, rough, horsetail, is, still, boiled, and, then, dried, in, japan, to, be, used, for, the, final, polishing, process, on, woodcraft, to, produce, a, smooth, finish, in, german, the, corresponding, name, is, zinnkraut, tin, herb, in, spanish, speaking, countries, these, plants, are, known, as, cola, de, caballo, horsetail, equisetum, leaves, are, greatly, reduced, and, usually, non, photosynthetic, they, contain, a, single, non, branching, vascular, trace, which, is, the, defining, feature, of, microphylls, however, it, has, recently, been, recognised, that, horsetail, microphylls, are, probably, not, ancestral, as, in, lycophytes, clubmosses, and, relatives, but, rather, derived, adaptations, evolved, by, reduction, of, megaphylls, the, leaves, of, horsetails, are, arranged, in, whorls, fused, into, nodal, sheaths, the, stems, are, usually, green, and, photosynthetic, and, are, distinctive, in, being, hollow, jointed, and, ridged, with, sometimes, 3, but, usually, 6, 40, ridges, there, may, or, may, not, be, whorls, of, branches, at, the, nodes, unusually, the, branches, often, emerge, below, the, leaves, in, an, internode, and, grow, from, buds, between, their, bases, the, spores, are, borne, under, sporangiophores, in, strobili, cone, like, structures, at, the, tips, of, some, of, the, stems, in, many, species, the, cone, bearing, shoots, are, unbranched, and, in, some, e, g, e, arvense, field, horsetail, they, are, non, photosynthetic, produced, early, in, spring, in, some, other, species, e, g, e, palustre, marsh, horsetail, they, are, very, similar, to, sterile, shoots, photosynthetic, and, with, whorls, of, branches, 12, 15, horsetails, are, mostly, homosporous, though, in, the, field, horsetail, smaller, spores, give, rise, to, male, prothalli, the, spores, have, four, elaters, that, act, as, moisture, sensitive, springs, assisting, spore, dispersal, through, crawling, and, hopping, motions, after, the, sporangia, have, split, open, longitudinally, they, are, photosynthetic, and, have, a, lifespan, that, is, usually, two, weeks, at, most, but, will, germinate, immediately, under, humid, conditions, and, develop, into, a, gametophyte, the, crude, cell, extracts, of, all, equisetum, species, tested, contain, mixed, linkage, glucan, xyloglucan, endotransglucosylase, mxe, activity, this, is, a, novel, enzyme, and, is, not, known, to, occur, in, any, other, plants, in, addition, the, cell, walls, of, all, equisetum, species, tested, contain, mixed, linkage, glucan, mlg, a, polysaccharide, which, until, recently, was, thought, to, be, confined, to, the, poales, the, evolutionary, distance, between, equisetum, and, the, poales, suggests, that, each, evolved, mlg, independently, the, presence, of, mxe, activity, in, equisetum, suggests, that, they, have, evolved, mlg, along, with, some, mechanism, of, cell, wall, modification, non, equisetum, land, plants, tested, lack, detectable, mxe, activity, an, observed, negative, correlation, between, xet, activity, and, cell, age, led, to, the, suggestion, that, xet, is, catalysing, endotransglycosylation, in, controlled, wall, loosening, during, cell, expansion, the, lack, of, mxe, in, the, poales, suggests, that, there, it, must, play, some, other, currently, unknown, role, due, to, the, correlation, between, mxe, activity, and, cell, age, mxe, has, been, proposed, to, promote, the, cessation, of, cell, expansion, the, living, members, of, the, genus, equisetum, are, divided, into, three, distinct, lineages, which, are, usually, treated, as, subgenera, the, name, of, the, type, subgenus, equisetum, means, horse, hair, in, latin, while, the, name, of, the, other, large, subgenus, hippochaete, means, horse, hair, in, greek, hybrids, are, common, but, hybridization, has, only, been, recorded, between, members, of, the, same, subgenus, while, plants, of, subgenus, equisetum, are, usually, referred, to, as, horsetails, those, of, subgenus, hippochaete, are, often, called, scouring, rushes, especially, when, unbranched, two, equisetum, plants, are, sold, commercially, under, the, names, equisetum, japonicum, barred, horsetail, and, equisetum, camtschatcense, kamchatka, horsetail, these, are, both, types, of, e, hyemale, var, hyemale, although, they, may, also, be, listed, as, separate, varieties, of, e, hyemale, the, oldest, remains, of, modern, horsetails, of, the, genus, equisetum, first, appear, in, the, early, jurassic, represented, by, equisetum, dimorphum, from, the, early, jurassic, of, patagonia, and, equisetum, laterale, from, the, early, middle, jurassic, of, australia, silicified, remains, of,

antarctica, though, they, are, not, known, to, be, native, to, australia, new, zealand, nor, the, islands, of, the, pacific, they, are, most, common, in, northern, north, america, canada, and, the, northernmost, united, states, where, the, genus, is, represented, by, nine, species, e, arvense, e, fluviatile, e, hyemale, e, laevigatum, e, palustre, e, pratense, e, scirpoides, e, sylvaticum, and, e, variegatum, only, four, e, bogotense, e, giganteum, e, myriochaetum, and, e, ramosissimum, of, the, fifteen, species, are, known, to, be, native, south, of, the, equator, they, are, perennial, plants, herbaceous, and, dying, back, in, winter, as, most, temperate, species, or, evergreen, as, most, tropical, species, and, the, temperate, species, e, hyemale, rough, horsetail, e, ramosissimum,

that, are, deep, underground, and, difficult, to, dig, out, field, horsetail, e, arvense, can, be, a, nuisance, weed, readily, regrowing, from, the, rhizome, after, being, pulled, out, it, is, unaffected, by, many, herbicides, designed, to, kill, seed, plants, since, the, stems, have, a, waxy, coat, the, plant, is, resistant, to, contact, weedkillers, like, glyphosate, however, as, e, arvense, prefers, an, acid, soil, lime, may, be, used, to, assist, in, eradication, efforts, to, bring, the, soil, ph, to, 7, or, 8, members, of, the, genus, have, been, declared, noxious, weeds, in, australia, and, in, the, us, state, of, oregon, all, the, equisetum, are, classed, as, unwanted, organisms, in, new, zealand, and, are, listed, on, the, national, pest, plant, accord, people, have, regularly, consumed, horsetails, for, example, the, fertile, stems, bearing, strobili, of, some, species, are, cooked, and, eaten, like, asparagus, a, dish, called, tsukushi, in, japan, indigenous, nations, across, cascadia, consume, and, use, horsetails, in, a, variety, of, ways, with, the, squamish, calling, them, sx, m, x, em, and, the, lushootseed, using, g, ik, or, horsetail, roots, for, cedar, root, baskets, the, young, plants, are, eaten, cooked, or, raw, but, considerable, care, must, be, taken, if, eaten, over, a, long, enough, period, of, time, some, species, of, horsetail, can, be, poisonous, to, grazing, animals, including, horses, the, toxicity, appears, to, be, due, to, thiaminase, which, can, cause, thiamin, vitamin, b1, deficiency, equisetum, species, may, have, been, a, common, food, for, herbivorous, dinosaurs, with, studies, showing, that, horsetails, are, nutritionally, of, high, quality, it, is, assumed, that, horsetails, were, an, important, component, of, herbivorous, dinosaur, diets, analysis, of, the, scratch, marks, on, hadrosaur, teeth, is, consistent, with, grazing, on, hard, plants, like, horsetails, extracts, and, other, preparations, of, e, arvense, have, served, as, herbal, remedies, with, records, dating, over, centuries, in, 2009, the, european, food, safety, authority, concluded, there, was, no, evidence, for, the, supposed, health, effects, of, e, arvense, such, as, for, invigoration, weight, control, skincare, hair, health, or, bone, health, as, of, 2018, there, is, insufficient, scientific, evidence, for, its, effectiveness, as, a, medicine, to, treat, any, human, condition, e, arvense, contains, thiaminase, which, metabolizes, the, b, vitamin, thiamine, potentially, causing, thiamine, deficiency, and, associated, liver, damage, if, taken, chronically, horsetail, might, produce, a, diuretic, effect, further, its, safety, for, oral, consumption, has, not, been, sufficiently, evaluated, and, it, may, be, toxic, especially, to, children, and, pregnant, women
