cro, magnons, or, european, early, modern, humans, eemh, were, the, first, early, modern, humans, homo, sapiens, to, settle, in, europe, migrating, from, western, asia, continuously, occupying, the, continent, possibly, from, as, early, as, 56, 800, years, ago, they, interacted, and, interbred, with, the, indigenous, neanderthals, h, neanderthalensis, of, europe, and, western, asia, who, went, extinct, 40, 000, to, 35, 000, years, ago, the, first, wave, of, modern, humans, in, europe, initial, upper, paleolithic, left, no, genetic, legacy, to, modern, europeans, however, from, 37, 000, years, ago, a, second, wave, succeeded, in, forming, a, single, founder, population, from, which, all, subsequent, cro, magnons, descended, and, which, contributes, ancestry, to, present, day, europeans, cro, magnons, produced, upper, palaeolithic, cultures, the, first, major, one, being, the, aurignacian, which, was, succeeded, by, the, gravettian, by, 30, 000, years, ago, the, gravettian, split, into, the, epi, gravettian, in, the, east, and, solutrean, in, the, west, due, to, major, climatic, degradation, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, lgm, peaking, 21, 000, years, ago, as, europe, warmed, the, solutrean, evolved, into, the, magdalenian, by, 20, 000, years, ago, and, these, peoples, recolonised, europe, the, magdalenian, and, epi, gravettian, gave, way, to, mesolithic, cultures, as, big, game, animals, were, dying, out, and, the, last, glacial, period, drew, to, a, close, cro, magnons, were, anatomically, similar, to, present, day, europeans, west, asians, and, north, africans, but, were, more, robust, having, larger, brains, broader, faces, more, prominent, brow, ridges, and, bigger, teeth, compared, to, the, present, day, average, the, earliest, cro, magnon, specimens, also, exhibit, some, features, that, are, reminiscent, of, those, found, in, neanderthals, the, first, cro, magnons, would, have, had, darker, skin, tones, than, most, modern, europeans, natural, selection, for, lighter, skin, would, not, begin, until, 30, 000, years, ago, before, the, last, glacial, maximum, lgm, cro, magnons, had, overall, low, population, density, tall, stature, similar, to, post, industrial, humans, and, expansive, trade, routes, stretching, as, long, as, 900, km, 560, mi, and, hunted, big, game, animals, cro, magnons, had, much, higher, populations, than, the, neanderthals, possibly, due, to, higher, fertility, rates, life, expectancy, for, both, species, was, typically, under, 40, years, following, the, lgm, population, density, increased, as, communities, travelled, less, frequently, though, for, longer, distances, and, the, need, to, feed, so, many, more, people, in, tandem, with, the, increasing, scarcity, of, big, game, caused, them, to, rely, more, heavily, on, small, or, aquatic, game, and, more, frequently, participate, in, game, drive, systems, and, slaughter, whole, herds, at, a, time, the, cro, magnon, arsenal, included, spears, spear, throwers, harpoons, and, possibly, throwing, sticks, and, palaeolithic, dogs, cro, magnons, likely, commonly, constructed, temporary, huts, while, moving, around, and, gravettian, peoples, notably, made, large, huts, on, the, east, european, plain, out, of, mammoth, bones, cro, magnons, are, well, renowned, for, creating, a, diverse, array, of, artistic, works, including, cave, paintings, venus, figurines, perforated, batons, animal, figurines, and, geometric, patterns, they, also, wore, decorative, beads, and, plant, fibre, clothes, dyed, with, various, plant, based, dyes, for, music, they, produced, bone, flutes, and, whistles, and, possibly, also, bullroarers, rasps, drums, idiophones, and, other, instruments, they, buried, their, dead, though, possibly, only, people, who, had, achieved, or, were, born, into, high, status, the, name, cro, magnon, comes, from, the, five, skeletons, discovered, by, french, palaeontologist, louis, lartet, in, 1868, at, the, cro, magnon, rock, shelter, les, eyzies, dordogne, france, after, the, area, was, accidentally, discovered, while, a, road, was, constructed, for, a, railway, station, remains, of, palaeolithic, cultures, have, been, known, for, centuries, but, they, were, initially, interpreted, in, a, creationist, model, wherein, they, represented, antediluvian, peoples, which, were, wiped, out, by, the, great, flood, following, the, conception, and, popularisation, of, evolution, in, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, cro, magnons, became, the, subject, of, much, scientific, racism, with, early, race, theories, allying, with, nordicism, and, pan, germanism, such, historical, race, concepts, were, overturned, by, the, mid, 20th, century, during, the, first, wave, feminism, movement, the, venus, figurines, were, notably, interpreted, as, evidence, of, some, matriarchal, religion, though, such, claims, had, mostly, died, down, in, academia, by, the, 1970s, when, early, modern, humans, homo, sapiens, migrated, onto, the, european, continent, they, interacted, with, the, indigenous, neanderthals, h, neanderthalensis, which, had, already, inhabited, europe, for, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, in, 2019, greek, palaeoanthropologist, katerina, harvati, and, colleagues, argued, that, two, 210, 000, year, old, skulls, from, apidima, cave, greece, represent, modern, humans, rather, than, neanderthals, indicating, these, populations, have, an, unexpectedly, deep, history, but, this, was, disputed, in, 2020, by, french, paleoanthropologist, marie, antoinette, de, lumley, and, colleagues, about, 60, 000, years, ago, marine, isotope, stage, 3, began, characterised, by, oscillating, climatic, patterns, causing, sudden, retreat, and, recolonisation, phases, in, vegetation, fluctuating, between, forestland, and, open, steppeland, the, earliest, indication, of, upper, palaeolithic, modern, human, migration, into, europe, is, a, series, of, modern, human, teeth, with, neronian, industry, stone, tools, found, at, mandrin, cave, malataverne, in, france, dated, in, 2022, to, between, 56, 800, and, 51, 700, years, ago, the, neronian, is, one, of, the, many, industries, associated, with, modern, humans, classed, as, transitional, between, the, middle, and, upper, palaeolithic, beyond, this, there, is, the, balkan, bohunician, industry, beginning, 48, 000, years, ago, likely, deriving, from, the, levantine, emiran, industry, the, remains, found, in, the, cave, ilsenh, hle, in, ranis, germany, up, to, 47, 500, years, old, and, the, next, oldest, fossils, date, to, roughly, 44, 000, years, ago, in, bulgaria, italy, and, britain, it, is, unclear, while, migrating, westward, if, they, followed, the, danube, or, went, along, the, mediterranean, coast, beginning, about, 45, 000, years, ago, the, proto, aurignacian, culture, the, first, widely, recognised, european, upper, palaeolithic, culture, spread, out, across, europe, probably, descending, from, the, near, eastern, ahmarian, culture, the, aurignacian, industry, took, hold, perhaps, in, south, central, europe, sometime, after, 40, 000, years, ago, with, the, onset, of, heinrich, event, 4, a, period, of, extreme, seasonality, and, the, campanian, ignimbrite, eruption, near, naples, which, covered, eastern, europe, in, ash, the, aurignacian, culture, rapidly, replaced, others, across, the, continent, this, wave, of, modern, humans, replaced, neanderthals, and, their, mousterian, culture, in, the, danube, valley, aurignacian, sites, are, few, and, far, between, compared, to, later, traditions, until, 35, 000, years, ago, from, here, the, typical, aurignacian, becomes, quite, prevalent, and, extends, until, 29, 000, years, ago, gradually, replaced, by, the, gravettian, culture, the, close, of, the, aurignacian, is, poorly, defined, aurignacoid, or, epi, aurignacian, tools, are, identified, as, late, as, 18, to, 15, thousand, years, ago, it, is, also, unclear, where, the, gravettian, originated, from, as, it, diverges, strongly, from, the, aurignacian, and, therefore, may, not, have, descended, from, it, nonetheless, genetic, evidence, indicates, that, not, all, aurignacian, bloodlines, went, extinct, hypotheses, for, gravettian, genesis, include, evolution, in, central, europe, from, the, szeletian, which, developed, from, the, bohunician, which, existed, 41, 000, to, 37, 000, years, ago, or, from, the, ahmarian, or, similar, cultures, from, the, near, east, or, the, caucasus, that, existed, before, 40, 000, years, ago, it, is, further, debated, where, the, earliest, occurrence, is, identified, with, the, former, hypothesis, arguing, for, germany, about, 37, 500, years, ago, and, the, latter, buran, kaya, iii, rockshelter, in, crimea, about, 38, to, 36, thousand, years, ago, in, either, case, the, appearance, of, the, gravettian, coincides, with, a, significant, temperature, drop, also, around, 37, 000, years, ago, the, founder, population, of, all, later, early, modern, humans, existed, and, europe, would, remain, in, genetic, isolation, from, the, rest, of, the, world, for, the, next, 23, 000, years, around, 29, 000, years, ago, marine, isotope, stage, 2, began, and, cooling, intensified, this, peaked, about, 21, 000, years, ago, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, lgm, when, scandinavia, the, baltic, region, and, the, british, isles, were, covered, in, glaciers, and, winter, sea, ice, reached, the, french, seaboard, the, alps, were, also, covered, in, glaciers, and, most, of, europe, was, polar, desert, with, mammoth, steppe, and, forest, steppe, dominating, the, mediterranean, coast, consequently, large, swathes, of, europe, were, uninhabitable, and, two, distinct, cultures, emerged, with, unique, technologies, to, adapt, to, the, new, environment, the, solutrean, in, southwestern, europe, which, invented, brand, new, technologies, and, the, epi, gravettian, from, italy, to, the, east, european, plain, which, adapted, the, previous, gravettian, technologies, solutrean, peoples, inhabited, the, permafrost, zone, whereas, epi, gravettian, peoples, appear, to, have, stuck, to, less, harsh, seasonally, frozen, areas, relatively, few, sites, are, known, through, this, time, the, glaciers, began, retreating, about, 20, 000, years, ago, and, the, solutrean, evolved, into, the, magdalenian, which, would, recolonise, western, and, central, europe, over, the, next, couple, thousand, years, starting, during, the, older, dryas, roughly, 14, 000, years, ago, final, magdalenian, traditions, appear, namely, the, azilian, hamburgian, and, creswellian, during, the, b, lling, aller, d, warming, near, eastern, genes, began, showing, up, in, the, indigenous, europeans, indicating, the, end, of, europe, s, genetic, isolation, possibly, due, to, the, continual, reduction, of, european, big, game, the, magdalenian, and, epi, gravettian, were, completely, replaced, by, the, mesolithic, by, the, beginning, of, the, holocene, europe, was, completely, re, peopled, during, the, holocene, climatic, optimum, from, 9, to, 5, thousand, years, ago, mesolithic, western, hunter, gatherers, whg, contributed, significantly, to, the, present, day, european, genome, alongside, ancient, north, eurasians, ane, which, descended, from, the, siberian, mal, ta, buret,

genetic, makeup, near, eastern, neolithic, farmers, which, split, from, the, european, hunter, gatherers, about, 40, 000, years, ago, started, to, spread, out, across, europe, by, 8, 000, years, ago,

leading, to, les, eyzies, a, hamlet, in, the, commune, of, les, eyzies, de, tayac, sireuil, dordogne, southwestern, france, in, 1868, m, fran, ois, berthoumeyrou, a, contractor, was, commissioned, to, make, a, road, along, the, railway, connecting, the, new, les, eyzies, train, station, in, march, the, road, workers, dug, up, a, rock, shelter, around, 10, m, 33, ft, deep, on, the, left, bank, of,

discovery, he, also, informed, a, local, geologist, abel, laganne, who, recovered, ornaments, more, flints, and, two, human, skulls, as, assigned, by, the, french, minister, of, public, instruction, victor, duruy, to, verify, the, finds, louis, lartet, made, systematic, excavation, and, discovered, additional, human, remains, animal, bones, stone, tools, and, ornaments, he, deliberated, the, discovery, before, the, meeting, of, the, society, of, anthropology, of, paris, on, 21, may, the, proceedings, published, in, its, journal, bulletins, et, m, moires, de, la, soci, t, d, anthropologie, de, paris, he, described, the, site, as, a, cemetery, and, identified, the, humans, as, cave, dwellers, the, site, is, called, abri, de, cro, magnon, cro, magnon, rock, shelter, now, recognised, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, abri, means, rock, shelter, in, french, cro, means, hole, in, occitan, and, magnon, was, the, landowner, the, original, human, remains, were, brought, to, and, preserved, at, the, national, museum, of, natural, history, in, paris, the, number, of, individuals, at, the, cro, magnon, rock, shelter, has, eluded, scientists, for, over, a, century, the, original, workers, reported, that, they, found, 15, skeletons, in, his, report, lartet, identified, five, individuals, based, on, the, skulls, three, of, them, males, designated, cro, magnon, 1, 3, and, 4, one, female, cro, magnon, 2, and, an, infant, cro, magnon, 5, in, 1868, anatomist, paul, broca, noted, five, adults, and, several, infants, broca, introduced, the, specimen, names, and, called, cro, magnon, 1, le, vieillard, from, which, the, name, old, man, became, popularly, used, after, complete, analyses, of, individual, bones, by, early, 2000s, it, became, generally, agreed, that, the, rock, shelter, contained, 140, human, remains, from, at, least, eight, individuals, four, adults, and, four, infant, fossils, and, artifacts, from, the, palaeolithic, had, actually, been, known, for, decades, but, these, were, interpreted, in, a, creationist, model, as, the, concept, of, evolution, had, not, yet, been, conceived, for, example, the, aurignacian, red, lady, of, paviland, actually, a, young, man, from, south, wales, was, described, by, geologist, reverend, william, buckland, in, 1822, as, a, citizen, of, roman, britain, subsequent, authors, contended, the, skeleton, was, either, evidence, of, antediluvian, before, the, great, flood, people, in, britain, or, was, swept, far, from, the, inhabited, lands, farther, south, by, the, powerful, floodwaters, buckland, assumed, the, specimen, was, a, woman, because, he, was, adorned, with, jewellery, shells, ivory, rods, and, rings, and, a, wolf, bone, skewer, and, buckland, also, stated, possibly, in, jest, the, jewellery, was, evidence, of, witchcraft, around, this, time, the, uniformitarianism, movement, was, gaining, traction, headed, principally, by, charles, lyell, arguing, that, fossil, materials, well, predated, the, biblical, chronology, following, charles, darwin, s, 1859, on, the, origin, of, species, racial, anthropologists, and, raciologists, began, splitting, off, putative, species, and, subspecies, of, present, day, humans, based, on, unreliable, and, pseudoscientific, metrics, gathered, from, anthropometry, physiognomy, and, phrenology, continuing, into, the, 20th, century, 93, 96, this, was, a, continuation, of, carl, linnaeus, 1735, systema, naturae, where, he, invented, the, modern, classification, system, in, doing, so, classifying, humans, as, homo, sapiens, with, several, putative, subspecies, classifications, for, different, races, based, on, racist, behavioural, definitions, in, accord, with, historical, race, concepts, h, s, europaeus, european, descent, governed, by, laws, h, s, afer, african, descent, impulse, h, s, asiaticus, asian, descent, opinions, and, h, s, americanus, native, american, descent, customs, the, racial, classification, system, was, quickly, extended, to, fossil, specimens, including, both, cro, magnons, and, the, neanderthals, after, the, true, extent, of, their, antiquity, was, recognised, 110, in, 1869, lartet, had, proposed, the, subspecies, classification, h, s, fossilis, for, the, cro, magnon, remains, other, supposed, fossil, human, species, included, among, many, others, h, pre, aethiopicus, for, a, skull, from, dordogne, which, had, ethiopic, affinities, h, predmosti, or, h, predmostensis, for, a, series, of, skulls, from, brno, czech, republic, purportedly, transitional, between, neanderthals, and, cro, magnons, 110, 111, h, mentonensis, for, a, skull, from, menton, france, 88, h, grimaldensis, for, grimaldi, man, and, other, skeletons, near, grimaldi, monaco, 55, and, h, aurignacensis, or, h, a, hauseri, for, the, combe, capelle, skull, 15, these, fossil, races, alongside, ernst, haeckel, s, idea, of, there, being, backwards, races, which, require, further, evolution, social, darwinism, popularised, the, view, in, european, thought, that, the, civilised, white, man, had, descended, from, primitive, low, browed, ape, ancestors, through, a, series, of, savage, races, prominent, brow, ridges, were, classified, as, an, ape, like, trait, consequently, neanderthals, as, well, as, aboriginal, australians, were, considered, a, lowly, race, 116, these, european, fossils, were, considered, to, have, been, the, ancestors, to, specifically, living, european, races, 96, among, the, earliest, attempts, to, classify, cro, magnons, was, done, by, racial, anthropologists, joseph, deniker, and, william, z, ripley, in, 1900, who, characterised, them, as, tall, and, intelligent, proto, aryans, superior, to, other, races, who, descended, from, scandinavia, and, germany, further, race, theories, revolved, around, progressively, lighter, blonder, and, superior, races, evolving, in, central, europe, and, spreading, out, in, waves, to, replace, their, darker, ancestors, culminating, in, the, nordic, race, these, aligned, well, with, nordicism, and, pan, germanism, that, is, aryan, supremacy, which, gained, popularity, just, before, world, war, i, and, was, notably, used, by, the, nazis, to, justify, the, conquest, of, europe, and, the, supremacy, of, the, german, people, in, world, war, ii, 203, 205, stature, was, among, the, characteristics, used, to, distinguish, these, sub, races, so, taller, cro, magnons, such, as, specimens, from, the, french, cro, magnon, paviland, and, grimaldi, sites, were, classified, as, ancestral, to, the, nordic, race, and, smaller, ones, such, as, combe, capelle, and, chancelade, man, both, also, from, france, were, considered, the, forerunners, of, either, the, mediterranean, race, or, eskimoids, the, venus, figurines, sculptures, of, pregnant, women, with, exaggerated, breasts, and, thighs, were, used, as, evidence, of, the, presence, of, the, negroid, race, in, palaeolithic, europe, because, they, were, interpreted, as, having, been, based, on, real, women, with, steatopygia, a, condition, which, causes, thicker, thighs, common, in, the, women, of, the, san, people, of, southern, africa, and, the, hairdos, of, some, are, supposedly, similar, to, some, seen, in, ancient, egypt, by, the, 1940s, the, positivism, movement, which, fought, to, remove, political, and, cultural, bias, from, science, and, had, begun, about, a, century, earlier, had, gained, popular, support, in, european, anthropology, due, to, this, movement, and, raciology, s, associations, with, nazism, raciology, fell, out, of, practice, 137, the, beginning, of, the, upper, palaeolithic, is, thought, to, have, been, characterised, by, a, major, population, increase, in, europe, with, the, human, population, of, western, europe, possibly, increasing, by, a, factor, of, 10, in, the, neanderthal, modern, human, transition, the, archaeological, record, indicates, that, the, overwhelming, majority, of, palaeolithic, people, both, neanderthals, and, modern, humans, died, before, reaching, the, age, of, 40, with, few, elderly, individuals, recorded, it, is, possible, the, population, boom, was, caused, by, a, significant, increase, in, fertility, rates, a, 2005, study, estimated, the, population, of, upper, palaeolithic, europe, by, calculating, the, total, geographic, area, which, was, inhabited, based, on, the, archaeological, record, averaged, the, population, density, of, chipewyan, h, n, hill, people, and, naskapi, native, americans, which, live, in, cold, climates, and, applied, to, this, to, cro, magnons, and, assumed, that, population, density, continually, increased, with, time, calculated, by, the, change, in, the, number, of, total, sites, per, time, period, the, study, calculated, that, from, 40, to, 30, thousand, years, ago, the, population, was, roughly, 1, 700, 28, 400, average, 4, 400, from, 30, to, 22, thousand, years, ago, roughly, 1, 900, 30, 600, average, 4, 800, from, 22, to, 16, 5, thousand, years, ago, roughly, 2, 300, 37, 700, average, 5, 900, and, 16, 5, 11, 5, thousand, years, ago, roughly, 11, 300, 72, 600, average, 28, 700, following, the, lgm, cro, magnons, are, thought, to, have, been, much, less, mobile, and, featured, a, higher, population, density, indicated, by, seemingly, shorter, trade, routes, as, well, as, symptoms, of, nutritional, stress, cro, magnons, are, physically, similar, to, present, day, humans, with, a, globular, braincase, completely, flat, face, gracile, brow, ridge, and, defined, chin, however, the, bones, of, cro, magnons, are, somewhat, thicker, and, more, robust, the, earliest, cro, magnons, often, display, features, that, are, reminiscent, of, those, seen, in, neanderthals, aurignacians, in, particular, featured, a, higher, proportion, of, traits, somewhat, reminiscent, of, neanderthals, such, as, though, not, limited, to, a, slightly, flattened, skullcap, and, consequent, occipital, bun, protruding, from, the, back, of, the, skull, the, latter, could, be, quite, defined, their, frequency, significantly, diminished, in, gravettians, and, in, 2007, palaeoanthropologist, erik, trinkaus, concluded, these, were, remnants, of, neanderthal, introgression, which, were, eventually, bred, out, of, the, gene, pool, in, his, review, of, the, relevant, morphology, for, 28, modern, human, specimens, from, 190, to, 25, thousand, years, ago, average, brain, volume, was, estimated, to, have, been, about, 1, 478, cc, 90, 2, cu, in, and, for, 13, cro, magnons, about, 1, 514, cc, 92, 4, cu, in, in, comparison, present, day, humans, average, 1, 350, cc, 82, cu, in, which, is, notably, smaller, this, is, because, the, cro, magnon, brain, though, within, the, variation, for, present, day, humans, exhibits, longer, average, frontal, lobe, length, and, taller, occipital, lobe, height, the, parietal, lobes, however, are, shorter, in, cro, magnons, it, is, unclear, if, this, could, equate, to, any, functional, differences, between, present, day, and, early, modern, humans, in, early, upper, palaeolithic, western, europe, before, the, last, glacial, maximum, 20, men, and, 10, women, were, estimated, to, have, averaged, 176, 2, cm, 5, ft, 9, in, and, 162, 9, cm, 5, ft, 4, in, respectively, this, is, similar, to, post, industrial, modern, northern, europeans, in, contrast, in, a, sample, of, 21, and, 15, late, upper, palaeolithic, western, european, men, and, women, after, the, last, glacial, maximum, the, averages, were, 165, 6, cm, 5, ft, 5, in, and, 153, 5, cm, 5, ft, similar, to, pre, industrial, modern, humans, it, is, unclear, why, earlier, cro, magnons, were, taller, especially, considering, that, cold, climate, creatures, are, short, limbed, and, thus, short, statured, to, better, retain, body, heat, allen, s, rule, this, has, variously, been, explained, as, retention, of, a, hypothetically, tall, ancestral, condition, higher, quality, diet, and, nutrition, due, to, the, hunting, of, megafauna, which, later, became, uncommon, or, extinct, functional, adaptation, to, increase, stride, length, and, movement, efficiency, while, running, during, a, hunt, increasing, territorialism, among, later, cro, magnons, reducing, gene, flow, between, communities, and, increasing, inbreeding, rate, or, statistical, bias, due, to, small, sample, size, or, because, taller, people, were, more, likely, to, achieve, higher, status, in, a, group, before, the, lgm, and, thus, were, more, likely, to, be, buried, and, preserved, prior, to, genetic, analysis, it, was, generally, assumed, that, cro, magnons, like, present, day, europeans, were, light, skinned, as, an, adaptation, to, better, generate, vitamin, d, from, the, less, luminous, sun, farther, north, however, of, the, 3, predominant, genes, responsible, for, lighter, skin, in, present, day, europeans, kitlg, slc24a5, and, slc45a2, the, latter, two, as, well, as, the, tyrp1, gene, associated, with, lighter, hair, and, eye, colour, experienced, positive, selection, as, late, as, 19, to, 11, thousand, years, ago, during, the, mesolithic, transition, the, variation, of, the, gene, which, is, associated, with, blue, eyes, in, present, day, european, descended, humans, oca2, seems, to, have, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, about, 6, 10, thousand, years, ago, somewhere, in, northern, europe, such, a, late, timing, was, potentially, caused, by, overall, low, population, and, or, low, cross, continental, movement, required, for, such, an, adaptive, shift, in, skin, hair, and, eye, colouration, however, kitlg, experienced, positive, selection, in, cro, magnons, as, well, as, east, asians, beginning, approximately, 30, 000, years, ago, while, anatomically, modern, humans, have,

europeans, one, related, to, all, later, cro, magnons, a, basal, eurasian, lineage, which, split, from, the, common, ancestor, of, present, day, europeans, and, east, asians, before, they, split, from, each, other, and, another, related, to, a, 24, 000, year, old, individual, from, the, siberian, mal, ta, buret, culture, near, lake, baikal, contrary, to, this, fu, et, al, 2016, evaluating, much, earlier, european, specimens, including, ust, ishim, and, oase, 1, from, 45, 000, years, ago, found, no, evidence, of, a, basal, eurasian, component, to, the, genome, nor, did, they, find, evidence, of, mal, ta, buret, introgression, when, looking, at, a, wider, range, of, cro, magnons, from, the, entire, upper, palaeolithic, the, study, instead, concluded, that, such, a, genetic, makeup, in, present, day, europeans, stemmed, from, near, eastern, and, siberian, introgression, occurring, predominantly, in, the, neolithic, and, the, bronze, age, though, beginning, by, 14, 000, years, ago, but, all, cro, magnons, specimens, including, and, following, kostenki, 14, contributed, to, the, present, day, european, genome, and, were, more, closely, related, to, present, day, europeans, than, east, asians, earlier, cro, magnons, 10, tested, in, total, on, the, other, hand, did, not, seem, to, be, ancestral, to, any, present, day, population, nor, did, they, form, any,

these, the, study, also, concluded, that, beginning, roughly, 37, 000, years, ago, cro, magnons, descended, from, a, single, founder, population, and, were, reproductively, isolated, from, the, rest, of, the, world, the, study, reported, that, an, aurignacian, individual, from, grottes, de, goyet, belgium, has, more, genetic, affinities, to, the, magdalenian, inhabitants, of, cueva, de, el, mir,

thousand, years, ago, most, likely, in, west, asia, soon, after, modern, humans, left, africa, in, 2015, the, 40, 000, year, old, modern, human, oase, 1, was, found, to, have, had, 6, 9, point, estimate, 7, 3, neanderthal, dna, indicating, a, neanderthal, ancestor, up, to, four, to, six, generations, earlier, but, this, hybrid, romanian, population, does, not, appear, to, have, made, a, substantial, contribution, to, the, genomes, of, later, europeans, therefore, it, is, possible, that, interbreeding, was, common, between, neanderthals, and, cro, magnons, which, did, not, contribute, to, the, present, day, genome, the, percentage, of, neanderthal, genes, gradually, decreased, with, time, which, could, indicate, they, were, maladaptive, and, were, selected, out, of, the, gene, pool, valini, et, al, 2022, found, that, europe, was, populated, by, three, distinct, lineages, the, earliest, inhabitants, represented, by, zlaty, kun, 50kya, split, from, the, common, eurasian, lineage, before, the, divergence, of, western, and, eastern, eurasians, but, after, the, divergence, of, the, hypothetical, basal, eurasians, this, earliest, sample, did, not, cluster, with, any, modern, human, population, including, africans, and, died, out, without, leaving, ancestry, to, modern, peoples, the, second, wave, represented, by, bacho, kiro, 45kya, appeared, to, be, more, closely, related, to, modern, east, asians, and, australasians, compared, to, europeans, suggesting, that, this, lineage, split, initially, after, the, formation, of, eastern, eurasians, and, migrated, instead, northwestwards, into, europe, this, lineage, similarly, did, not, contribute, ancestry, to, later, populations, and, was, replaced, by, a, west, eurasian, lineage, 40kya, which, expanded, into, europe, and, siberia, proper, aurignacian, people, 40, 26kya, were, still, part, of, a, large, western, eurasian, meta, population, related, to, paleolithic, siberian, and, western, asian, populations, earlier, samples, such, as, the, bacho, kiro, sample, were, relatively, closer, to, east, asians, and, australasians, although, distinct, from, them, in, a, genetic, study, published, in, nature, in, march, 2023, the, authors, found, that, the, ancestors, of, the, western, hunter, gatherers, whgs, were, populations, associated, with, the, epigravettian, culture, which, largely, replaced, populations, associated, with, the, magdalenian, culture, about, 14, 000, years, ago, the, magdalenian, associated, individuals, descended, from, populations, associated, with, the, western, gravettian, solutrean, and, aurignacian, cultures, there, is, a, notable, technological, complexification, coinciding, with, the, replacement, of, neanderthals, with, cro, magnons, in, the, archaeological, record, and, so, the, terms, middle, palaeolithic, and, upper, palaeolithic, were, created, to, distinguish, between, these, two, time, periods, largely, based, on, western, european, archaeology, the, transition, was, dubbed, the, upper, palaeolithic, revolution, extended, to, be, a, worldwide, phenomenon, and, the, idea, of, behavioural, modernity, became, associated, with, this, event, and, early, modern, cultures, it, is, largely, agreed, that, the, upper, palaeolithic, seems, to, feature, a, higher, rate, of, technological, and, cultural, evolution, than, the, middle, palaeolithic, but, it, is, debated, if, behavioural, modernity, was, truly, an, abrupt, development, or, was, a, slow, progression, initiating, far, earlier, than, the, upper, paleolithic, especially, when, considering, the, non, european, archaeological, record, practices, considered, modern, include, the, production, of, microliths, the, common, use, of, bone, and, antler, the, common, use, of, grinding, and, pounding, tools, high, quality, evidence, of, body, decoration, and, figurine, production, long, distance, trade, networks, and, improved, hunting, technology, in, regard, to, art, the, magdalenian, produced, some, of, the, most, intricate, palaeolithic, pieces, and, they, even, elaborately, decorated, normal, everyday, objects, historically, ethnographic, studies, on, hunter, gatherer, subsistence, strategies, have, long, placed, emphasis, on, sexual, division, of, labour, and, most, especially, the, hunting, of, big, game, by, men, this, culminated, in, the, 1966, book, man, the, hunter, which, focuses, almost, entirely, on, the, importance, of, male, contributions, of, food, to, the, group, as, this, was, published, during, the, second, wave, feminism, movement, this, was, quickly, met, with, backlash, from, many, female, anthropologists, among, these, was, australian, archaeologist, betty, meehan, in, her, 1974, article, woman, the, gatherer, who, argued, that, women, play, a, vital, role, in, these, communities, by, gathering, more, reliable, food, plants, and, small, game, as, big, game, hunting, has, a, low, success, rate, the, concept, of, woman, the, gatherer, has, since, gained, significant, support, it, has, typically, been, assumed, that, cro, magnons, closely, studied, prey, habits, in, order, to, maximise, return, depending, on, the, season, for, example, large, mammals, including, red, deer, horses, and, ibex, congregate, seasonally, and, reindeer, were, possibly, seasonally, plagued, by, insects, rendering, fur, sometimes, unsuitable, for, hideworking, there, is, much, evidence, that, cro, magnons, especially, in, western, europe, following, the, lgm, corralled, large, prey, animals, into, natural, confined, spaces, such, as, against, a, cliff, wall, a, cul, de, sac, or, a, water, body, in, order, to, efficiently, slaughter, whole, herds, of, animals, game, drive, system, they, seem, to, have, scheduled, mass, kills, to, coincide, with, migration, patterns, in, particular, for, red, deer, horses, reindeer, bison, aurochs, and, ibex, and, occasionally, woolly, mammoths, there, are, also, multiple, examples, of, consumption, of, seasonally, abundant, fish, becoming, more, prevalent, in, the, mid, upper, palaeolithic, nonetheless, magdalenian, peoples, appear, to, have, had, a, greater, dependence, on, small, animals, aquatic, resources, and, plants, than, predecessors, probably, due, to, the, relative, scarcity, of, european, big, game, following, the, lgm, quaternary, extinction, event, post, lgm, peoples, tend, to, have, a, higher, rate, of, nutrient, deficiency, related, ailments, including, a, reduction, in, height, which, indicates, these, bands, probably, due, to, decreased, habitable, territory, had, to, consume, a, much, broader, and, less, desirable, food, range, to, survive, the, popularisation, of, game, drive, systems, may, have, been, an, extension, of, increasing, food, return, in, particularly, southwestern, france, cro, magnons, depended, heavily, upon, reindeer, and, so, it, is, hypothesised, that, these, communities, followed, the, herds, with, occupation, of, the, perigord, and, the, pyrenees, only, occurring, in, the, summer, epi, gravettian, communities, in, contrast, generally, focused, on, hunting, one, species, of, large, game, most, commonly, horse, or, bison, it, is, possible, that, human, activity, in, addition, to, the, rapid, retreat, of, favourable, steppeland, inhibited, recolonisation, of, most, of, europe, by, megafauna, following, the, lgm, such, as, mammoths, woolly, rhinoceroses, irish, elk, and, cave, lions, in, part, contributing, to, their, final, extinction, which, occurred, by, the, beginning, of, or, well, into, the, holocene, depending, on, the, species, for, weapons, cro, magnons, crafted, spearpoints, using, predominantly, bone, and, antler, possibly, because, these, materials, were, readily, abundant, compared, to, stone, these, materials, are, compressive, making, them, fairly, shatterproof, these, were, then, hafted, onto, a, shaft, to, be, used, as, javelins, it, is, possible, that, aurignacian, craftsmen, further, hafted, bone, barbs, onto, the, spearheads, but, firm, evidence, of, such, technology, is, recorded, earliest, 23, 500, years, ago, and, does, not, become, more, common, until, the, mesolithic, aurignacian, craftsmen, produced, lozenge, shaped, diamond, like, spearheads, by, 30, 000, years, ago, spearheads, were, manufactured, with, a, more, rounded, off, base, and, by, 28, 000, years, ago, spindle, shaped, heads, were, introduced, during, the, gravettian, spearheads, with, a, bevelled, base, were, being, produced, by, the, beginning, of, the, lgm, the, spear, thrower, was, invented, in, europe, which, can, increase, the, force, and, accuracy, of, the, projectile, a, possible, boomerang, made, of, mammoth, tusk, was, identified, in, poland, though, it, may, have, been, unable, to, return, to, the, thrower, and, dating, to, 23, 000, years, ago, it, would, be, the, oldest, known, boomerang, stone, spearheads, with, leaf, and, shouldered, points, become, more, prevalent, in, the, solutrean, both, large, and, small, spearheads, were, produced, in, great, quantity, and, the, smaller, ones, may, have, been, attached, to, projectile, darts, archery, was, possibly, invented, in, the, solutrean, though, less, ambiguous, bow, technology, is, first, reported, in, the, mesolithic, bone, technology, was, revitalised, in, the, magdalanian, and, long, range, technology, as, well, as, harpoons, become, much, more, prevalent, some, harpoon, fragments, are, speculated, to, have, been, leisters, or, tridents, and, true, harpoons, are, commonly, found, along, seasonal, salmon, migration, routes, as, opposed, to, the, patriarchy, prominent, in, historical, societies, the, idea, of, a, prehistoric, predominance, of, either, matriarchy, or, matrifocal, families, centred, on, motherhood, was, first, supposed, in, 1861, by, legal, scholar, johann, jakob, bachofen, the, earliest, models, of, this, believed, that, monogamy, was, not, widely, practiced, in, ancient, times, thus, the, paternal, line, was, resultantly, more, difficult, to, keep, track, of, than, the, maternal, resulting, in, a, matrilineal, and, matriarchal, society, matriarchs, were, then, conquered, by, patriarchs, at, the, dawn, of, civilisation, the, switch, from, matriarchy, to, patriarchy, and, the, hypothetical, adoption, of, monogamy, was, seen, as, a, leap, forward, however, when, the, first, palaeolithic, representations, of, humans, were, discovered, the, so, called, venus, figurines, which, typically, feature, pronounced, breasts, buttocks, and, vulvas, areas, generally, sexualised, in, present, day, western, culture, they, were, initially, interpreted, as, pornographic, in, nature, the, first, venus, discovered, was, named, the, v, nus, impudique, immodest, venus, by, the, discoverer, paul, hurault, 8th, marquis, de, vibraye, because, it, lacked, clothes, and, had, a, prominent, vulva, the, name, venus, after, the, roman, goddess, of, beauty, in, itself, implies, an, erotic, function, such, a, pattern, in, the, representation, of, the, human, form, led, to, suggestions, that, human, forms, were, generally, pornography, for, men, meaning, men, were, primarily, responsible, for, artwork, and, craftsmanship, in, the, palaeolithic, whereas, women, were, tasked, with, child, rearing, and, various, domestic, works, this, would, equate, to, a, patriarchal, social, system, the, palaeolithic, matriarchy, model, was, adapted, by, prominent, communist, friedrich, engels, who, instead, argued, that, women, were, robbed, of, power, by, men, due, to, economic, changes, which, could, only, be, undone, with, the, adoption, of, communism, marxist, feminism, the, former, sentiment, was, adopted, by, the, first, wave, feminism, movement, who, attacked, the, patriarchy, by, making, darwinist, arguments, of, a, supposed, natural, egalitarian, or, matrifocal, state, of, human, society, instead, of, patriarchal, as, well, as, interpreting, the, venuses, as, evidence, of, mother, goddess, worship, as, part, of, some, matriarchal, religion, consequently, by, the, mid, 20th, century, the, venuses, were, primarily, interpreted, as, evidence, of, some, palaeolithic, fertility, cult, such, claims, died, down, in, the, 1970s, as, archaeologists, moved, away, from, the, highly, speculative, models, produced, by, the, previous, generation, through, the, second, wave, feminism, movement, the, prehistoric, matriarchal, religion, hypothesis, was, primarily, propelled, by, lithuanian, american, archaeologist, marija, gimbutas, her, interpretations, of, the, palaeolithic, were, notably, involved, in, the, goddess, movement, equally, ardent, arguments, against, the, matriarchy, hypothesis, have, also, been, prominent, such, as, american, religious, scholar, cynthia, eller, s, 2000, the, myth, of, matriarchal, prehistory, looking, at, the, archaeological, record, depictions, of, women, are, markedly, more, common, than, of, men, in, contrast, to, the, commonplace, venuses, in, the, gravettian, gravettian, depictions, of, men, are, rare, and, contested, the, only, reliable, one, being, a, fragmented, ivory, figurine, from, the, grave, of, a, pavlovian, site, in, brno, czech, republic, it, is, also, the, only, statuette, found, in, a, palaeolithic, grave, 2, d, magdalenian, engravings, from, 15, to, 11, thousand, years, ago, do, depict, males, indicated, by, an, erect, penis, and, facial, hair, though, profiles, of, women, with, an, exaggerated, buttock, are, much, more, common, there, are, less, than, 100, depictions, of, males, in, the, cro, magnons, archaeological, record, of, them, about, a, third, are, depicted, with, erections, on, the, other, hand, most, individuals, which, received, a, burial, which, may, have, been, related, to, social, status, were, men, anatomically, the, robustness, of, limbs, which, is, an, indicator, of, strength, between, cro, magnon, men, and, women, were, consistently, not, appreciably, different, from, each, other, such, low, levels, of, sexual, dimorphism, through, the, upper, pleistocene, could, potentially, mean, that, sexual, division, of, labour, which, characterises, historic, societies, both, agricultural, and, hunter, gatherer, only, became, commonplace, in, the, holocene, the, upper, palaeolithic, is, characterised, by, evidence, of, expansive, trade, routes, and, the, great, distances, at, which, communities, could, maintain, interactions, the, early, upper, palaeolithic, is, especially, known, for, highly, mobile, lifestyles, with, gravettian, groups, at, least, those, analysed, in, italy, and, moravia, ukraine, often, sourcing, some, raw, materials, upwards, of, 200, km, 120, mi, however, it, is, debated, if, this, represents, sample, bias, and, if, western, and, northern, europe, were, less, mobile, some, cultural, practices, such, as, creating, venus, figurines, or, specific, burial, rituals, during, the, gravettian, stretched, 2, 000, km, 1, 200, mi, across, the, continent, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, despite, strong, evidence, of, cultural, transmission, gravettian, europeans, did, not, introgress, into, siberians, meaning, there, was, a, movement, of, ideas, but, not, people, between, europe, and, siberia, at, the, 30, 000, year, old, romanian, poiana, cire, ului, site, perforated, shells, of, the, homalopoma, sanguineum, sea, snail, were, recovered, which, is, significant, as, it, inhabits, the, mediterranean, at, nearest, 900, km, 560, mi, away, such, interlinkage, may, have, been, an, important, survival, tool, with, the, steadily, deteriorating, climate, given, low, estimated, population, density, this, may, have, required, a, rather, complex, cross, continental, social, organisation, system, by, and, following, the, lgm, population, densities, are, thought, to, have, been, much, higher, with, the, marked, decrease, of, habitable, lands, resulting, in, more, regional, economies, decreased, land, availability, could, have, increased, travel, distance, as, habitable, refugia, may, have, been, few, and, far, between, and, increasing, population, density, within, these, few, refugia, would, have, made, long, distance, travel, less, economic, this, trend, continued, into, the, mesolithic, with, the, adoption, of, sedentism, nonetheless, there, is, some, evidence, of, long, distance, magdalenian, trade, routes, for, example, at, lascaux, a, painting, of, a, bull, had, remnants, of, the, manganese, mineral, hausmannite, which, can, only, be, manufactured, in, heat, in, excess, of, 900, c, 1, 650, f, which, was, probably, impossible, for, cro, magnons, this, means, they, likely, encountered, natural, hausmannite, which, is, known, to, be, found, 250, km, 160, mi, away, in, the, pyrenees, unless, there, was, a, hausmannite, source, much, closer, to, lascaux, which, has, since, been, depleted, this, could, mean, that, there, was, a, local, economy, based, on, manganese, ores, also, at, ekain, basque, country, the, inhabitants, were, using, the, locally, rare, manganese, mineral, groutite, in, their, paintings, which, they, possibly, mined, out, of, the, cave, itself, based, on, the, distribution, of, mediterranean, and, atlantic, seashell, jewellery, even, well, inland, there, may, have, been, a, network, during, the, late, glacial, interstadial, 14, to, 12, thousand, years, ago, along, the, rivers, rhine, and, rh, ne, in, france, germany, and, switzerland, cro, magnon, cave, sites, quite, often, feature, distinct, spatial, organisation, with, certain, areas, specifically, designated, for, specific, activities, such, as, hearth, areas, kitchens, butchering, grounds, sleeping, grounds, and, trash, pile, it, is, difficult, to, tell, if, all, material, from, a, site, was, deposited, at, about, the, same, time, or, if, the, site, was, used, multiple, times, cro, magnons, are, thought, to, have, been, quite, mobile, indicated, by, the, great, lengths, of, trade, routes, and, such, a, lifestyle, was, likely, supported, by, the, constructions, of, temporary, shelters, in, open, environments, such, as, huts, evidence, of, huts, is, typically, associated, with, a, hearth, magdalenian, peoples, especially, are, thought, to, have, been, highly, migratory, following, herds, while, repopulating, europe, and, several, cave, and, open, air, sites, indicate, the, area, was, abandoned, and, revisited, regularly, the, 19, 000, year, old, peyre, blanque, site, france, and, at, least, the, 260, km, 2, 100, sq, mi, area, around, it, may, have, been, revisited, for, thousands, of, years, in, the, magdalenian, stone, lined, rectangular, areas, typically, 6, 15, m, 2, 65, 161, sq, ft, were, interpreted, as, having, been, the, foundations, or, flooring, of, huts, at, magdalenian, pincevent, france, small, circular, dwellings, were, speculated, to, have, existed, based, on, the, spacing, of, stone, tools, and, bones, these, sometimes, featured, an, indoor, hearth, work, area, or, sleeping, space, but, not, all, at, the, same, time, a, 23, 000, year, old, hut, from, the, israeli, ohalo, ii, was, identified, as, having, used, grasses, as, flooring, or, possibly, bedding, but, it, is, unclear, if, cro, magnons, also, lined, their, huts, with, grass, or, instead, used, animal, pelts, a, 13, 800, year, old, slab, from, mol, del, salt, spain, has, 7, dome, shaped, figures, engraved, onto, it, which, are, postulated, to, represent, temporary, dome, shaped, huts, over, 70, dwellings, constructed, by, cro, magnons, out, of, mammoth, bones, have, been, identified, primarily, from, the, russian, plain, possibly, semi, permanent, hunting, camps, they, seem, to, have, built, tipis, and, yarangas, these, were, typically, constructed, following, the, lgm, after, 22, 000, years, ago, by, epi, gravettian, peoples, the, earliest, hut, identified, comes, from, the, molodova, i, site, ukraine, which, was, dated, to, 44, 000, years, ago, making, it, possible, it, was, built, by, neanderthals, typically, these, huts, measured, 5, m, 16, ft, in, diameter, or, 4, m, 6, m, 13, ft, 20, ft, if, oval, shaped, huts, could, get, as, small, as, 3, m, 2, m, 9, 8, ft, 6, 6, ft, one, of, the, largest, huts, has, a, diameter, of, 12, 5, m, 41, ft, a, 25, 000, year, old, hut, identified, in, kostenki, russia, and, was, constructed, out, of, 64, mammoth, skulls, but, given, the, little, evidence, of, occupation, this, is, postulated, to, have, been, used, for, food, storage, rather, than, as, a, living, space, some, huts, have, burned, bones, which, has, typically, been, interpreted, as, bones, used, as, fuel, for, fireplaces, due, to, the, scarcity, of, firewood, and, or, disposal, of, waste, a, few, huts, however, have, evidence, of, wood, burning, or, mixed, wood, bone, burning, mammoth, hut, foundations, were, generally, made, by, pushing, a, great, quantity, of, mammoth, skulls, into, the, ground, most, commonly, though, not, always, with, the, tusks, facing, up, to, possibly, be, used, as, further, supports, and, the, walls, by, putting, into, the, ground, vertically, shoulder, blades, pelvises, long, bones, jaws, and, the, spine, long, bones, were, often, used, as, poles, commonly, placed, on, the, end, of, another, long, bone, or, in, the, cavity, of, where, tusk, used, to, be, foundation, may, have, extended, as, far, as, 40, cm, 16, in, underground, generally, multiple, huts, were, built, in, a, locality, placed, 1, 20, m, 3, 70, ft, apart, depending, on, location, tusks, may, have, been, used, to, make, entrances, skins, pulled, over, for, roofing, and, the, interior, sealed, up, by, loess, dug, out, of, pits, some, architectural, decisions, seem, to, have, been, purely, for, aesthetics, best, seen, in, the, 4, epi, gravettian, huts, from, mezhyrich, mezine, ukraine, where, jaws, were, stacked, to, create, a, chevron, or, zigzag, pattern, in, 2, huts, and, long, bones, were, stacked, to, create, horizontal, or, vertical, lines, in, respectively, 1, and, 2, huts, the, chevron, was, a, commonly, used, symbol, on, the, russian, plain, painted, or, engraved, on, bones, tools, figurines, and, mammoth, skulls, at, some, point, in, time, cro, magnons, domesticated, the, dog, probably, as, a, result, of, a, symbiotic, hunting, relationship, dna, evidence, suggests, that, present, day, dogs, split, from, wolves, around, the, beginning, of, the, lgm, however, potential, palaeolithic, dogs, have, been, found, preceding, this, namely, the, 36, 000, year, old, goyet, dog, from, belgium, and, the, 33, 000, year, old, altai, dog, from, siberia, which, could, indicate, there, were, multiple, attempts, at, domesticating, european, wolves, these, dogs, had, a, wide, size, range, from, over, 60, cm, 2, ft, in, height, in, eastern, europe, to, less, than, 30, 45, cm, 1, ft, 1, ft, 6, in, in, central, and, western, europe, and, 32, 41, kg, 71, 90, lb, in, all, of, europe, these, dogs, are, identified, by, having, a, shorter, snout, and, skull, and, wider, palate, and, braincase, than, contemporary, wolves, nonetheless, an, aurignacian, origin, for, domestication, is, controversial, at, the, 27, to, 24, thousand, year, old, p, edmost, site, czech, republic, 3, dogs, were, identified, with, their, skulls, perforated, probably, to, extract, the, brain, and, 1, had, a, mammoth, bone, in, its, mouth, the, discoverers, interpreted, this, as, a, burial, ritual, the, 14, 500, year, old, bonn, oberkassel, dog, from, germany, was, found, buried, alongside, a, 40, year, old, man, and, a, 25, year, old, woman, as, well, as, traces, of, red, hematite, and, is, genetically, placed, as, an, ancestor, to, present, day, dogs, it, was, diagnosed, with, canine, distemper, virus, and, probably, died, between, 19, and, 23, weeks, of, age, it, would, have, required, extensive, human, care, to, survive, without, being, able, to, contribute, anything, suggesting, that, at, this, point, humans, and, dogs, were, connected, by, emotional, or, symbolic, ties, rather, than, purely, materialistic, personal, gain, the, exact, utility, of, these, proto, dogs, is, unclear, but, they, may, have, played, a, vital, role, in, hunting, as, well, as, domestic, services, such, as, transporting, items, or, guarding, camp, or, carcasses, when, examples, of, upper, palaeolithic, art, were, first, discovered, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, form, of, engraved, objects, they, were, assumed, to, have, been, art, for, art, s, sake, as, palaeolithic, peoples, were, widely, conceived, as, having, been, uncultured, savages, this, model, was, primarily, championed, by, french, archaeologist, louis, laurent, gabriel, de, mortillet, then, detailed, paintings, found, deep, within, caves, were, discovered, the, first, being, cueva, de, altamira, spain, in, 1879, the, art, for, art, s, sake, model, came, apart, by, the, turn, of, the, century, as, more, examples, of, cave, art, were, found, in, hard, to, reach, places, in, western, europe, such, as, combarelles, and, font, de, gaume, for, which, the, idea, of, it, being, simply, a, leisure, activity, became, increasingly, untenable, cro, magnons, are, well, known, for, having, painted, or, engraved, geometric, designs, hand, stencils, plants, animals, and, seemingly, human, animal, hybrid, creatures, on, cave, walls, deep, inside, caves, typically, the, same, species, are, represented, in, caves, which, have, such, art, but, the, total, number, of, species, is, quite, numerous, and, namely, includes, creatures, such, as, mammoths, bison, lions, bears, and, ibex, nonetheless, some, caves, were, dominated, by, certain, forms, such, as, grotte, de, niaux, where, over, half, of, the, animals, are, bison, images, could, be, drawn, on, top, of, one, another, landscapes, were, never, depicted, with, the, exception, of, a, supposed, depiction, of, a, volcanic, eruption, at, chauvet, pont, d, arc, france, dating, to, 36, 000, years, ago, cave, art, is, found, in, dark, cave, recesses, and, the, artists, either, lit, a, fire, on, the, cave, floor, or, used, portable, stone, lamps, to, see, drawing, materials, include, black, charcoal, and, red, and, yellow, ochre, crayons, but, they, along, with, a, variety, of, other, minerals, could, also, be, ground, into, powder, and, mixed, with, water, to, create, paint, large, flat, rocks, may, have, been, used, as, palettes, and, brushes, may, have, included, reeds, bristles, and, twigs, and, possibly, a, blowgun, was, used, to, spray, paint, over, less, accessible, areas, hand, stencils, could, either, be, made, by, holding, the, hand, to, the, wall, and, spitting, paint, over, it, leaving, a, negative, image, or, by, applying, paint, to, the, hand, and, then, sticking, it, to, the, wall, some, hand, stencils, are, missing, fingers, but, it, is, unclear, if, the, artist, was, actually, missing, the, finger, or, simply, excluded, it, from, the, stencil, it, has, generally, been, assumed, that, the, larger, prints, were, left, by, men, and, the, smaller, ones, by, boys, but, the, exclusion, of, women, entirely, may, be, improbable, though, many, hypotheses, have, been, proposed, for, the, symbolism, of, cave, art, it, is, still, debated, why, these, works, were, created, in, the, first, place, one, of, the, first, hypotheses, regarding, their, symbolism, was, forwarded, by, french, religious, historian, salomon, reinach, who, supposed, that, because, only, animals, were, depicted, on, cave, walls, the, images, represented, totem, veneration, in, which, a, group, or, a, group, member, identifies, with, a, certain, animal, associated, with, certain, powers, and, honours, or, respects, this, animal, in, some, way, such, as, by, not, hunting, it, if, this, were, the, case, then, cro, magnons, communities, within, a, region, would, have, subdivided, themselves, into, for, example, a, horse, clan, a, bison, clan, a, lion, clan, and, so, forth, this, was, soon, contested, as, some, caves, contain, depictions, of, animals, wounded, by, projectiles, and, generally, multiple, species, are, represented, in, 1903, reinach, proposed, that, the, cave, art, represented, sympathetic, magic, between, the, painting, and, the, painting, s, subject, and, by, drawing, an, animal, doing, some, kind, of, action, the, artist, believed, they, were, exerting, that, same, action, onto, the, animal, that, is, by, being, the, master, of, the, image, they, could, master, the, animal, itself, the, hunting, magic, model, and, the, idea, that, art, was, magical, and, utilitarian, in, cro, magnons, society, gained, much, popularity, in, the, following, decades, in, this, model, herbivorous, prey, items, were, depicted, as, having, been, wounded, prior, to, a, hunt, in, order, to, cast, a, spell, over, them, some, animals, were, incompletely, depicted, to, enfeeble, them, geometric, designs, were, traps, and, human, animal, hybrids, were, sorcerers, dressed, as, animals, to, gain, their, power, or, were, gods, ruling, over, the, animals, many, animals, were, depicted, as, completely, healthy, and, intact, and, sometimes, pregnant, which, this, model, interprets, as, fertility, magic, to, promote, reproduction, however, if, the, animal, was, a, carnivore, then, this, model, says, that, the, depiction, served, to, destroy, the, animal, by, the, mid, 20th, century, this, model, was, being, contested, because, of, how, few, depictions, of, wounded, animals, exist, the, collection, of, consumed, animal, bones, in, decorated, caves, often, did, not, match, types, of, animals, depicted, in, terms, of, abundance, and, the, magic, model, does, not, explain, hand, stencils, following, the, 1960s, begun, by, german, american, art, historian, max, raphael, the, study, of, cave, art, took, on, a, much, more, statistical, approach, analysing, and, quantifying, items, such, as, the, types, and, distribution, of, animals, depicted, cave, topography, and, cave, wall, morphology, based, on, such, structuralist, tests, horses, and, bovines, seem, to, have, been, preferentially, clustered, together, typically, in, a, central, position, and, such, binary, organisation, led, to, the, suggestion, that, this, was, sexual, symbolism, and, some, animals, and, iconography, were, designated, by, cro, magnons, as, either, male, or, female, this, conclusion, has, been, heavily, contested, as, well, due, to, the, subjective, definition, of, association, between, two, different, animals, and, the, great, detail, the, animals, were, depicted, in, permitting, sexual, identification, and, further, the, hypothesis, that, bison, were, supposed, to, be, feminine, contradicts, the, finding, that, many, are, male, also, in, the, late, 20th, century, with, the, popularisation, of, the, hypothesis, that, cro, magnons, practised, shamanism, the, human, animal, hybrids, and, geometrical, symbols, were, interpreted, within, this, framework, as, the, visions, a, shaman, would, see, while, in, a, trance, entoptic, phenomena, opponents, mainly, attack, the, comparisons, made, between, palaeolithic, cultures, and, present, day, shamanistic, societies, for, being, in, some, way, inaccurate, in, 1988, archaeologists, david, lewis, williams, and, thomas, dowson, suggested, trances, were, induced, by, hallucinogenic, plants, containing, either, mescaline, lsd, or, psilocybin, but, there, is, no, evidence, cro, magnons, purposefully, ate, them, venus, figurines, are, commonly, found, associated, with, cro, magnons, and, are, the, earliest, well, acknowledged, representation, of, human, figures, these, are, most, frequently, found, in, the, gravettian, notably, in, the, french, upper, p, rigordian, the, czech, pavlovian, and, west, russian, kostenkian, most, dating, from, 29, to, 23, thousand, years, ago, almost, all, venuses, depict, naked, women, and, are, generally, hand, held, sized, they, feature, a, downturned, head, no, face, thin, arms, which, end, at, or, cross, over, voluminous, breasts, rotund, buttocks, a, distended, abdomen, interpreted, as, pregnancy, tiny, and, bent, legs, and, pegged, or, unnaturally, short, feet, venuses, vary, in, proportions, which, may, represent, limitations, using, certain, materials, over, others, or, intentional, design, choices, eastern, european, venuses, seem, to, have, more, of, an, emphasis, on, the, breasts, and, stomach, whereas, western, european, ones, emphasise, the, hips, and, thighs, the, earliest, interpretations, of, the, venuses, believed, these, were, literal, representations, of, women, with, obesity, or, steatopygia, a, condition, where, a, woman, s, body, stores, more, fat, in, the, thighs, and, buttocks, making, them, especially, prominent, another, early, hypothesis, was, that, ideal, womanhood, for, cro, magnons, involved, obesity, or, that, the, venuses, were, used, by, men, as, erotica, due, to, the, exaggeration, of, body, parts, typically, sexualised, in, western, culture, as, well, as, the, lack, of, detail, to, individualising, traits, such, as, the, face, and, limbs, extending, present, day, western, norms, to, palaeolithic, peoples, was, contested, and, a, counter, interpretation, is, that, either, venuses, were, mother, goddesses, or, that, cro, magnons, believed, depictions, of, things, had, magical, properties, over, the, subject, and, that, such, a, depiction, of, a, pregnant, woman, would, facilitate, fertility, and, fecundity, this, is, also, contested, as, it, assumes, women, are, only, thought, of, in, terms, of, child, rearing, cro, magnons, also, carved, perforated, batons, out, of, horn, bone, or, stone, most, commonly, through, the, solutrean, and, magdalenian, such, batons, disappear, from, the, archaeological, record, at, the, magdalenian, s, close, some, batons, seem, phallic, in, nature, by, 2010, about, 60, batons, had, been, hypothesised, to, be, representations, of, penises, all, with, erections, of, which, 30, show, decoration, and, 23, are, perforated, several, phallic, batons, are, depicted, as, circumcised, and, seemingly, bearing, some, ornamentation, such, as, piercings, scarification, or, tattooing, the, purpose, of, perforated, batons, has, been, debated, which, suggestions, for, spiritual, or, religious, purposes, ornamentation, or, status, symbol, currency, drumsticks, tent, holders, weaving, tools, spear, straighteners, spear, throwers, or, dildos, unperforated, phallic, batons, measuring, just, a, few, centimetres, long, to, up, to, 30, cm, 12, in, were, interpreted, as, sex, toys, quite, early, on, depictions, of, animals, were, commonly, produced, by, cro, magnons, as, of, 2015, as, many, as, 50, aurignacian, ivory, figurines, and, fragments, have, been, recovered, from, the, german, swabian, jura, of, the, discernible, figures, most, represent, mammoths, and, lions, and, a, few, horses, bison, possibly, a, rhino, waterfowl, fish, and, small, mammals, these, sculptures, are, hand, sized, and, would, have, been, portable, works, and, some, figurines, were, made, into, wearable, pendants, some, figurines, also, featured, enigmatic, engravings, dots, marks, lines, hooks, and, criss, cross, patterns, cro, magnons, also, made, purely, symbolic, engravings, there, are, several, plaques, of, bone, or, antler, referred, to, as, polishers, spatulas, palettes, or, knives, which, feature, series, of, equidistantly, placed, notches, most, notably, the, well, preserved, 32, 000, year, old, blanchard, plaque, from, l, abri, blanchard, france, which, features, 24, markings, in, a, seemingly, serpentine, pattern, the, discoverer, british, palaeontologist, thomas, rupert, jones, speculated, in, 1875, this, was, an, early, counting, system, for, tallying, items, such, as, animals, killed, or, some, other, notation, system, in, 1957, czech, archaeologist, karel, absolon, suggested, they, represent, arithmetic, in, 1972, marshack, postulated, they, may, be, calendars, also, in, 1972, marshack, identified, 15, to, 13, thousand, year, old, magdalenian, plaques, bearing, small, abstract, symbols, seemingly, into, organised, blocks, or, sets, which, he, interpreted, as, representing, an, early, writing, system, czech, archaeologist, bohuslav, kl, ma, speculated, a, complex, engraving, on, a, mammoth, tusk, he, discovered, in, the, gravettian, pavlov, site, czech, republic, as, being, a, map, showing, a, meandering, river, centre, left, a, mountain, centre, right, and, a, living, grounds, at, the, centre, indicated, by, a, double, circle, a, few, similar, engravings, have, been, identified, across, europe, in, particular, the, russian, plain, which, he, also, postulated, were, maps, plans, or, stories, cro, magnons, are, commonly, associated, with, large, pieces, of, pigments, crayons, namely, made, of, red, ochre, for, cro, magnons, it, is, typically, assumed, that, ochre, was, used, for, some, symbolic, purposes, most, notably, for, cosmetics, such, as, body, paint, this, is, because, ochre, in, some, sites, had, to, be, imported, from, incredibly, long, distances, and, it, is, also, associated, with, burials, it, is, unclear, why, they, specifically, chose, red, ochre, instead, of, other, colours, in, terms, of, colour, psychology, popular, hypotheses, include, the, putative, female, cosmetic, coalitions, hypothesis, and, the, red, dress, effect, it, is, also, possible, that, ochre, was, chosen, for, its, utility, such, as, an, ingredient, for, adhesives, hide, tanning, agent, insect, repellent, sunscreen, medicinal, properties, dietary, supplement, or, as, a, soft, hammer, cro, magnons, appear, to, have, been, using, grinding, and, crushing, tools, to, process, ochre, before, applying, it, to, the, skin, in, 1962, french, archaeologists, saint, just, and, marthe, p, quart, identified, bi, pointed, needles, in, the, magdalenian, le, mas, d, azil, which, they, speculated, might, have, been, used, in, tattooing, hypothesised, depictions, of, penises, from, most, commonly, the, magdalenian, though, a, few, dating, back, to, the, aurignacian, appear, to, be, decorated, with, tattoos, scarification, and, piercings, designs, include, lines, plaques, dots, or, holes, and, human, or, animal, figures, cro, magnons, produced, beads, which, are, typically, assumed, to, have, been, attached, to, clothing, or, portable, items, as, body, decoration, beads, had, already, been, in, use, since, the, middle, palaeolithic, but, production, dramatically, increased, in, the, upper, palaeolithic, it, is, unclear, why, communities, chose, specific, raw, materials, over, other, ones, and, they, seem, to, have, upheld, local, bead, making, traditions, for, a, very, long, time, for, example, mediterranean, communities, used, specific, types, of, marine, shells, to, make, beads, and, pendants, for, more, than, 20, 000, years, and, central, and, western, european, communities, often, used, pierced, animal, and, less, commonly, human, teeth, in, the, aurignacian, beads, and, pendants, were, being, made, of, shells, teeth, ivory, stone, bone, and, antler, and, there, are, a, few, examples, of, use, of, fossil, materials, including, a, belemnite, nummulite, ammonite, and, amber, they, may, have, also, been, producing, ivory, and, stone, rings, diadems, and, labrets, beads, could, be, manufactured, in, numerous, different, styles, such, as, conical, elliptical, drop, shaped, disc, shaped, ovoid, rectangular, trapezoidal, and, so, on, beads, may, have, been, used, to, facilitate, social, communication, to, display, the, wearer, s, socio, economic, status, as, they, could, have, been, capable, of, communicating, labour, costs, and, thereby, a, person, s, wealth, energy, connections, etc, simply, by, looking, at, them, the, distribution, of, ornaments, on, buried, gravettian, individuals, and, the, likeliness, that, most, of, the, buried, were, dressed, with, whatever, they, were, wearing, upon, death, indicates, that, jewellery, was, primarily, worn, on, the, head, as, opposed, to, the, neck, or, the, torso, the, gravettian, doln, v, stonice, i, and, iii, and, pavlov, i, sites, in, moravia, czech, republic, yielded, many, clay, fragments, with, textile, impressions, these, indicate, a, highly, sophisticated, and, standardised, textile, industry, including, the, production, of, single, ply, double, ply, triple, ply, and, braided, string, and, cordage, knotted, nets, wicker, baskets, and, woven, cloth, including, simple, and, diagonal, twined, cloth, plain, woven, cloth, and, twilled, cloth, some, cloths, appear, to, have, a, design, pattern, there, are, also, plaited, items, which, may, have, been, baskets, or, mats, due, to, the, wide, range, of, textile, gauges, and, weaves, it, is, possible, they, could, also, produce, wall, hangings, blankets, bags, shawls, shirts, skirts, and, sashes, these, people, used, plant, rather, than, animal, fibres, possibly, nettle, milkweed, yew, or, alder, which, have, historically, been, used, in, weaving, such, plant, fibre, fragments, have, also, been, recorded, at, the, russian, kostenki, and, zaraysk, as, well, as, the, german, g, nnersdorf, site, the, inhabitants, of, dzudzuana, cave, georgia, appear, to, have, been, staining, flax, fibres, with, plant, based, dyes, including, yellow, red, pink, blue, turquoise, violet, black, brown, gray, green, and, khaki, the, emergence, of, textiles, in, the, european, archaeological, record, also, coincides, with, the, proliferation, of, the, sewing, needle, in, european, sites, ivory, needles, are, found, in, most, late, upper, palaeolithic, sites, which, could, correlate, to, frequent, sewing, and, the, predominance, of, small, needles, too, small, to, tailor, clothes, out, of, hide, and, leather, could, indicate, work, on, softer, woven, fabrics, or, accessory, stitching, and, embroidery, of, leather, products, there, is, some, potential, evidence, of, simple, loom, technology, however, these, have, also, been, interpreted, as, either, hunting, implements, or, art, pieces, rounded, objects, made, of, mammoth, phalanges, from, p, edmost, and, avdeevo, russia, may, have, been, loom, weights, or, human, figures, perforated, washer, like, ivory, or, bone, discs, from, across, europe, were, potentially, spindle, whorls, a, foot, shaped, piece, of, ivory, from, kniegrotte, germany, was, possibly, a, comb, or, a, decorative, pendant, on, the, basis, of, wearing, analyses, cro, magnons, are, also, speculated, to, have, used, net, spacers, or, weaving, sticks, in, 1960, french, archaeologist, fernand, lacorre, suggested, that, perforated, batons, were, used, to, spin, cordage, some, venuses, depict, hairdos, and, clothing, worn, by, gravettian, women, the, venus, of, willendorf, seems, to, be, wearing, a, cap, possibly, woven, fabric, or, made, from, shells, featuring, at, least, seven, rows, and, an, additional, two, half, rows, covering, the, nape, of, the, neck, it, may, have, been, made, starting, at, a, knotted, centre, and, spiraling, downward, from, right, to, left, and, then, backstitching, all, the, rows, to, each, other, the, kostenki, 1, venus, seems, to, be, wearing, a, similar, cap, though, each, row, seems, to, overlap, the, other, the, venus, of, brassempouy, seems, to, be, wearing, some, nondescript, open, twined, hair, cover, the, engraved, venus, of, laussel, from, france, seems, to, be, wearing, some, headwear, with, rectangular, gridding, and, could, potentially, represent, a, snood, most, east, european, venuses, with, headwear, also, display, notching, and, checkwork, on, the, upper, body, which, are, suggestive, of, bandeaux, a, strip, of, cloth, bordering, around, the, tops, of, the, breasts, with, some, even, featuring, straps, connecting, it, to, around, the, neck, these, seem, to, be, absent, in, western, european, venuses, some, also, wear, belts, in, eastern, europe, these, are, seen, on, the, waist, whereas, in, central, and, western, europe, they, are, worn, on, the, low, hip, the, venus, of, lespugue, seems, to, be, wearing, a, plant, fibre, string, skirt, comprising, 11, cords, running, behind, the, legs, cro, magnons, are, known, to, have, created, flutes, out, of, hollow, bird, bones, as, well, as, mammoth, ivory, first, appearing, in, the, archaeological, record, with, the, aurignacian, about, 40, 000, years, ago, in, the, german, swabian, jura, the, swabian, jura, flutes, appear, to, have, been, able, to, produce, a, wide, range, of, tones, one, virtually, complete, flute, made, of, the, radius, of, a, griffon, vulture, from, hohle, fels, measures, 21, 8, cm, 8, 6, in, in, length, and, 0, 8, cm, 0, 31, in, in, diameter, the, bone, had, been, smoothed, down, and, was, pierced, with, holes, these, finger, holes, exhibit, cut, marks, which, could, indicate, the, exact, placement, of, these, holes, was, specifically, measured, to, create, concert, pitch, that, is, to, make, the, instrument, in, tune, or, a, scale, the, part, near, the, elbow, joint, had, two, v, shaped, carvings, presumably, a, mouthpiece, ivory, flutes, would, have, required, a, great, time, investment, to, make, as, it, requires, more, skill, and, precision, to, craft, compared, to, a, bird, bone, flute, a, section, of, ivory, must, be, sawed, off, to, the, correct, size, cut, in, half, so, it, can, be, hollowed, out, and, then, the, two, pieces, have, to, be, refitted, and, stuck, together, by, an, adhesive, in, an, air, tight, seal, cro, magnons, also, created, bone, whistles, out, of, deer, phalanges, such, sophisticated, music, technology, could, potentially, speak, to, a, much, longer, musical, tradition, than, the, archaeological, record, indicates, as, modern, hunter, gatherers, have, been, documented, to, create, instruments, out, of, more, biodegradable, materials, less, likely, to, fossilise, such, as, reeds, gourds, skins, and, bark, more, or, less, unmodified, items, such, as, horns, conch, shells, logs, and, stones, and, their, weapons, including, spear, thrower, shafts, or, boomerangs, as, clapsticks, or, a, hunting, bow, it, is, speculated, that, a, few, cro, magnon, artefacts, represent, bullroarers, or, percussion, instruments, such, as, rasps, but, these, are, harder, to, prove, one, probable, bullroarer, is, identified, at, lalinde, france, dating, to, 14, to, 12, thousand, years, ago, measuring, 16, cm, 6, 3, in, long, and, decorated, with, geometric, incisions, in, the, mammoth, bone, houses, at, mezine, ukraine, an, 80, cm, 20, cm, 31, 5, in, 7, 9, in, thigh, bone, a, 53, cm, 50, cm, 21, in, 20, in, jawbone, a, 57, cm, 63, cm, 22, in, 25, in, shoulder, blade, and, a, 63, cm, 43, cm, 25, in, 17, in, pelvis, of, a, mammoth, bear, evidence, of, paint, and, repeated, percussion, these, were, first, proposed, by, archaeologist, sergei, bibikov, to, have, served, as, drums, with, either, a, reindeer, antler, or, mammoth, tusk, fragment, also, found, at, the, site, being, used, as, a, drum, stick, though, this, is, contested, other, european, sites, have, yielded, potential, percussion, mallets, made, of, mammoth, bone, or, reindeer, antler, it, is, speculated, that, some, cro, magnons, marked, certain, sections, of, caves, with, red, paint, which, could, be, struck, to, produce, a, note, that, would, resonate, throughout, the, cave, chamber, somewhat, like, a, xylophone, the, early, modern, human, vocal, apparatus, is, generally, thought, to, have, been, the, same, as, that, in, present, day, humans, as, the, present, day, variation, of, the, foxp2, gene, associated, with, the, neurological, prerequisites, for, speech, and, language, ability, seems, to, have, evolved, within, the, last, 100, 000, years, and, the, modern, human, hyoid, bone, which, supports, the, tongue, and, facilitates, speech, evolved, by, 60, 000, years, ago, demonstrated, by, the, israeli, skhul, and, qafzeh, humans, these, indicate, upper, palaeolithic, humans, had, the, anatomical, basis, for, language, and, the, same, range, of, potential, phonemes, sounds, as, present, day, humans, though, cro, magnon, languages, likely, contributed, to, present, day, languages, it, is, unclear, what, early, languages, would, have, sounded, like, because, words, denature, and, are, replaced, by, entirely, original, words, quite, rapidly, making, it, difficult, to, identity, language, cognates, a, word, in, multiple, different, languages, which, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, which, originated, before, 9, to, 5, thousand, years, ago, nonetheless, it, has, been, controversially, hypothesised, that, eurasian, languages, are, all, related, and, form, the, nostratic, languages, with, an, early, common, ancestor, existing, just, after, the, end, of, the, lgm, in, 2013, evolutionary, biologist, mark, pagel, and, colleagues, postulated, that, among, nostratic, languages, frequently, used, words, more, often, have, speculated, cognates, and, that, this, was, evidence, that, 23, identified, words, were, ultraconserved, and, supposedly, changed, very, little, in, use, and, pronunciation, descending, from, a, common, ancestor, about, 15, 000, years, ago, at, the, end, of, the, lgm, archaeologist, paul, heggarty, said, that, pagel, s, data, was, subjective, interpretation, of, supposed, cognates, and, the, extreme, volatility, of, sound, and, pronunciation, of, words, for, example, latin, aquam, water, french, eau, in, just, 2, 000, years, makes, it, unclear, if, cognates, can, even, be, identified, that, far, back, if, they, do, indeed, exist, several, upper, palaeolithic, caves, feature, depictions, of, seemingly, part, human, part, animal, chimaeras, typically, part, bison, reindeer, or, deer, variously, termed, anthropozoomorphs, therianthropes, or, sorcerers, these, have, typically, been, interpreted, as, being, the, centre, of, some, shamanistic, ritual, and, to, represent, some, cultural, revolution, and, the, origins, of, subjectivity, the, oldest, such, cave, drawing, has, been, identified, at, the, 30, 000, year, old, chauvet, cave, where, a, figure, with, a, bison, upper, body, and, human, lower, body, was, drawn, onto, a, stalactite, facing, a, depiction, of, a, vulva, with, two, tapering, legs, 208, 209, the, 17, 000, year, old, grotte, de, lascaux, france, has, a, seemingly, dead, bird, human, hybrid, between, a, rhino, and, a, charging, bison, with, a, bird, on, top, of, a, pole, placed, near, the, figure, s, right, hand, a, bird, on, a, stick, is, used, as, a, symbol, of, mystical, power, by, some, modern, shamanistic, cultures, who, believe, that, birds, are, psychopomps, and, can, move, between, the, land, of, the, living, and, the, land, of, the, dead, in, these, cultures, they, believe, the, shaman, can, either, transform, into, a, bird, or, use, a, bird, as, a, spirit, guide, the, 14, 000, year, old, grotte, des, trois, fr, res, france, features, 3, sorcerers, the, so, called, the, dancing, sorcerer, or, god, of, les, trois, fr, res, seems, to, bear, human, legs, and, feet, paws, a, deer, head, with, antlers, a, fox, or, horse, tail, a, beard, and, a, flaccid, penis, interpreted, as, dancing, on, all, fours, another, smaller, sorcerer, with, a, bison, head, human, legs, and, feet, and, upright, posture, stands, above, several, animal, depictions, and, is, interpreted, as, holding, and, playing, a, musical, bow, to, herd, all, the, animals, the, third, sorcerer, has, a, seemingly, bison, upper, body, and, human, lower, body, with, testicles, and, an, erection, some, drawn, human, figures, feature, lines, radiating, out, these, are, generally, interpreted, as, wounded, people, with, the, lines, representing, pain, or, spears, possibly, related, to, some, initiation, process, for, shamans, one, such, wounded, man, at, grotte, de, cougnac, france, is, drawn, on, the, chest, of, a, red, irish, elk, a, wounded, sorcerer, with, a, bison, head, is, found, at, the, 17, 000, year, old, grotte, de, gabillou, some, caves, featured, vanquished, men, lying, presumably, dead, at, the, foot, of, generally, a, bull, or, bear, for, tangible, art, the, early, aurignacian, hohlenstein, stadel, swabian, jura, has, yielded, the, famous, lion, human, sculpture, it, is, 30, cm, 12, in, tall, which, is, much, larger, than, the, other, swabian, jura, figurines, a, possible, second, lion, human, was, also, found, in, the, nearby, hohle, fels, an, ivory, slab, from, geissenkl, sterle, has, a, carved, relief, of, a, human, figure, with, its, arms, raised, in, the, air, wearing, a, hide, the, worshipper, a, 28, 000, year, old, puppet, was, identified, at, brno, czech, republic, consisting, of, an, isolated, head, piece, torso, piece, and, left, arm, piece, it, is, presumed, that, the, head, and, torso, were, connected, by, a, rod, and, the, torso, and, arm, by, some, string, allowing, the, arm, to, move, because, it, was, found, in, a, grave, this, is, speculated, to, have, belonged, to, a, shaman, for, use, in, rituals, involving, the, dead, a, 14, 000, year, old, large, stone, from, cueva, del, juyo, spain, seems, to, have, been, carved, to, be, the, conjoined, face, of, a, man, on, the, right, and, a, big, cat, on, the, left, when, facing, it, the, man, half, seems, to, feature, a, moustache, and, a, beard, the, cat, half, either, a, leopard, or, a, lion, has, slanting, eyes, a, snout, a, fang, and, spots, on, the, muzzle, suggestive, of, whiskers, spanish, archaeologists, leslie, g, freeman, and, joaqu, n, gonz, lez, echegaray, argued, that, cueva, del, juyo, was, specifically, modified, to, serve, as, a, sanctuary, site, to, carry, out, rituals, they, said, the, inhabitants, dug, out, a, triangular, trench, and, filled, it, with, offerings, including, patella, limpets, the, common, periwinkle, a, sea, snail, pigments, the, legs, and, jaws, possibly, with, meat, still, on, them, of, red, and, roe, deer, and, a, red, deer, antler, positioned, upright, the, trench, and, offerings, were, then, filled, in, with, dirt, and, a, seemingly, flower, like, arrangement, of, bright, cylindrical, pieces, of, red, yellow, and, green, pigments, was, placed, on, top, this, was, then, buried, with, clay, stone, slabs, and, bone, spearpoints, the, clay, shell, was, covered, by, a, 900, kg, 2, 000, lb, slab, of, limestone, supported, by, large, flat, stones, somewhat, similar, structures, associated, with, some, representation, of, a, human, have, also, been, found, elsewhere, in, magdalenian, spain, such, as, at, cueva, de, erralla, entrefoces, rock, shelter, cueva, de, praileaitz, cueva, de, la, garma, and, cueva, de, erberua, cro, magnons, buried, their, dead, commonly, with, a, variety, symbolic, grave, goods, as, well, as, red, ochre, and, multiple, people, were, often, buried, in, the, same, grave, however, the, archaeological, record, has, yielded, few, graves, less, than, 5, preserved, per, millennium, which, could, indicate, burials, were, seldom, given, consequently, it, is, unclear, if, they, represent, isolated, burials, or, form, a, much, more, generalised, mortuary, tradition, across, europe, some, graves, contained, multiple, individuals, in, this, case, most, often, featuring, both, sexes, most, burials, are, dated, to, the, gravettian, most, notably, 31, 29, thousand, years, ago, and, towards, the, end, of, the, magdalenian, from, 14, to, 11, thousand, years, ago, none, are, identified, during, the, aurignacian, gravettian, burials, seem, to, differ, from, post, lgm, ones, the, former, ranged, across, europe, from, portugal, to, siberia, whereas, the, latter, conspicuously, restricted, to, italy, germany, and, southwest, france, about, half, of, buried, gravettians, were, infants, whereas, infant, burials, were, much, less, common, post, lgm, but, it, is, debated, if, this, was, due, to, social, differences, or, infant, mortality, rates, graves, are, also, commonly, associated, with, animal, remains, and, tools, but, it, is, unclear, if, this, was, intentional, or, was, coincidentally, a, part, of, the, filler, they, are, much, less, common, post, lgm, and, post, lgm, graves, are, more, commonly, associated, with, ornaments, than, gravettian, graves, the, most, lavish, palaeolithic, burial, is, a, grave, from, the, gravettian, of, sungir, russia, where, a, boy, and, a, girl, were, placed, crown, to, crown, in, a, long, shallow, grave, and, adorned, with, thousands, of, perforated, ivory, beads, hundreds, of, perforated, arctic, fox, canines, ivory, pins, disc, pendants, ivory, animal, figurines, and, mammoth, tusk, spears, the, beads, were, a, third, the, size, of, those, found, with, a, man, from, the, same, site, which, could, indicate, these, small, beads, were, specifically, designed, for, the, children, only, two, other, upper, palaeolithic, graves, were, found, with, grave, goods, other, than, personal, adornment, one, from, arene, candide, italy, and, brno, czech, republic, and, the, grave, of, these, two, children, is, unique, in, bearing, any, functional, implements, the, spears, as, well, as, a, bone, from, another, individual, a, partial, femur, the, 5, other, buried, individuals, from, sungir, did, not, receive, nearly, as, many, grave, goods, with, one, seemingly, given, no, formal, treatment, whatsoever, however, most, gravettian, graves, feature, few, ornaments, and, the, buried, were, probably, wearing, them, before, death, due, to, such, rich, material, culture, and, the, marked, difference, of, treatment, between, different, individuals, it, has, been, suggested, that, these, peoples, had, a, complex, society, beyond, band, level, and, with, social, class, distinction, in, this, model, young, individuals, given, elaborate, funerals, were, potentially, born, into, a, position, of, high, status, however, about, 75, of, cro, magnon, skeletons, were, men, which, sharply, contrasts, with, the, predominance, of, depictions, of, women, in, art, because, of, the, great, amount, of, time, labour, and, resources, all, these, grave, goods, would, have, required, it, has, been, hypothesised, that, the, grave, goods, were, made, long, in, advance, of, the, ceremony, because, of, such, planning, for, multiple, burials, as, well, as, their, abundance, in, the, archaeological, record, the, seemingly, purposeful, presence, of, both, sexes, and, an, apparent, preference, for, individuals, with, some, congenital, disorder, about, a, third, of, identified, burials, it, is, generally, speculated, that, these, cultures, practiced, human, sacrifice, either, in, fear, disdain, or, worship, of, those, with, abnormal, features, like, in, many, present, day, and, historical, societies, intricate, funerals, in, addition, to, evidence, of, shamanism, and, ritualism, has, also, provoked, hypotheses, of, the, belief, of, an, afterlife, by, cro, magnons, the, earliest, evidence, of, skull, cups, and, thus, ritual, cannibalism, comes, from, the, magdalenian, of, gough, s, cave, england, further, concrete, evidence, of, such, rituals, does, not, appear, until, after, the, palaeolithic, the, gough, s, cave, cup, seems, to, have, followed, a, similar, method, of, scalping, as, those, from, neolithic, europe, with, incisions, being, made, along, the, midline, of, the, skull, whereas, the, native, american, method, of, scalping, involved, a, circular, incision, around, the, crown, earlier, examples, of, non, ritual, cannibalism, in, europe, do, not, seem, to, have, followed, the, same, method, of, defleshing, at, least, 1, skull, cup, was, transported, from, a, different, site, in, addition, gough, s, cave, also, yielded, a, human, radius, with, a, zig, zag, engraving, compared, to, other, artefacts, in, the, cave, or, common, to, the, magdalenian, period, the, radius, was, modified, quite, little, with, the, engraving, probably, quickly, etched, on, indicated, by, scrape, marks, not, recorded, on, any, other, magdalenian, engraving, and, the, bone, broken, and, discarded, soon, thereafter, this, may, indicate, the, bone, s, only, function, was, as, a, tool, in, some, cannibalistic, and, or, funerary, ritual, rather, than, being, prepared, to, be, carried, around, by, the, group, as, an, ornament, or, tool, the, caveman, archetype, is, quite, popular, in, both, literature, and, visual, media, and, can, be, portrayed, as, highly, muscular, hairy, or, monstrous, and, to, represent, a, wild, and, animalistic, character, drawing, on, the, characteristics, of, a, wild, man, cavemen, are, often, represented, in, front, of, a, cave, or, fighting, a, dangerous, animal, wielding, stone, bone, or, wooden, tools, usually, for, combat, and, dressed, in, an, exposing, fur, cloak, men, often, are, depicted, with, unkempt, unstyled, shoulder, length, or, longer, hair, usually, with, a, beard, cavemen, first, appeared, in, visual, media, in, d, w, griffith, s, 1912, man, s, genesis, and, among, the, first, appearances, in, fictional, literature, were, stanley, waterloo, s, 1897, the, story, of, ab, and, jack, london, s, 1907, before, adam, cavemen, have, also, been, popularly, portrayed, inaccurately, as, confronting, dinosaurs, first, done, in, griffith, s, 1914, brute, force, the, sequel, to, man, s, genesis, featuring, a, ceratosaurus, cro, magnons, are, also, portrayed, interacting, with, neanderthals, such, as, in, j, h, rosny, s, 1911, quest, for, fire, h, g, wells, 1927, the, grisly, folk, william, golding, s, 1955, the, inheritors, bj, rn, kurt, n, s, 1978, dance, of, the, tiger, jean, m, auel, s, 1980, clan, of, the, cave, bear, and, her, earth, s, children, series, and, elizabeth, marshall, thomas, 1987, reindeer, moon, and, its, 1990, sequel, the, animal, wife, cro, magnons, are, generally, portrayed, as, superior, in, some, way, to, neanderthals, which, allowed, them, to, take, europe
