a, medication, also, called, medicament, medicine, pharmaceutical, drug, medicinal, drug, or, simply, drug, is, a, drug, used, to, diagnose, cure, treat, or, prevent, disease, drug, therapy, pharmacotherapy, is, an, important, part, of, the, medical, field, and, relies, on, the, science, of, pharmacology, for, continual, advancement, and, on, pharmacy, for, appropriate, management, drugs, are, classified, in, many, ways, one, of, the, key, divisions, is, by, level, of, control, which, distinguishes, prescription, drugs, those, that, a, pharmacist, dispenses, only, on, the, order, of, a, physician, physician, assistant, or, qualified, nurse, from, over, the, counter, drugs, those, that, consumers, can, order, for, themselves, another, key, distinction, is, between, traditional, small, molecule, drugs, usually, derived, from, chemical, synthesis, and, biopharmaceuticals, which, include, recombinant, proteins, vaccines, blood, products, used, therapeutically, such, as, ivig, gene, therapy, monoclonal, antibodies, and, cell, therapy, for, instance, stem, cell, therapies, other, ways, to, classify, medicines, are, by, mode, of, action, route, of, administration, biological, system, affected, or, therapeutic, effects, an, elaborate, and, widely, used, classification, system, is, the, anatomical, therapeutic, chemical, classification, system, the, world, health, organization, keeps, a, list, of, essential, medicines, drug, discovery, and, drug, development, are, complex, and, expensive, endeavors, undertaken, by, pharmaceutical, companies, academic, scientists, and, governments, as, a, result, of, this, complex, path, from, discovery, to, commercialization, partnering, has, become, a, standard, practice, for, advancing, drug, candidates, through, development, pipelines, governments, generally, regulate, what, drugs, can, be, marketed, how, drugs, are, marketed, and, in, some, jurisdictions, drug, pricing, controversies, have, arisen, over, drug, pricing, and, disposal, of, used, drugs, medication, is, a, medicine, or, a, chemical, compound, used, to, treat, or, cure, illness, according, to, encyclop, dia, britannica, medication, is, a, substance, used, in, treating, a, disease, or, relieving, pain, as, defined, by, the, national, cancer, institute, dosage, forms, of, medication, can, include, tablets, capsules, liquids, creams, and, patches, medications, can, be, given, in, different, ways, such, as, by, mouth, by, infusion, into, a, vein, or, by, drops, put, into, the, ear, or, eye, a, medication, that, does, not, contain, an, active, ingredient, and, is, used, in, research, studies, is, called, a, placebo, in, europe, the, term, is, medicinal, product, and, it, is, defined, by, eu, law, as, in, the, us, a, drug, is, drug,

consequently, medicines, will, not, be, licensed, for, this, use, in, those, countries, a, single, drug, may, contain, single, or, multiple, active, ingredients, the, administration, is, the, process, by, which, a, patient, takes, medicine, there, are, three, major, categories, of, drug, administration, enteral, via, the, human, gastrointestinal, tract, injection, into, the, body, and, by, other, routes, dermal, nasal, ophthalmic, otologic, and, urogenital, oral, administration, the, most, common, form, of, enteral, administration, can, be, performed, using, various, dosage, forms, including, tablets, or, capsules, and, liquid, such, as, syrup, or, suspension, other, ways, to, take, the, medication, include, buccally, placed, inside, the, cheek, sublingually, placed, underneath, the, tongue, eye, and, ear, drops, dropped, into, the, eye, or, ear, and, transdermally, applied, to, the, skin, they, can, be, administered, in, one, dose, as, a, bolus, administration, frequencies, are, often, abbreviated, from, latin, such, as, every, 8, hours, reading, q8h, from, quaque, viii, hora, the, drug, frequencies, are, often, expressed, as, the, number, of, times, a, drug, is, used, per, day, e, g, four, times, a, day, it, may, include, event, related, information, e, g, 1, hour, before, meals, in, the, morning, at, bedtime, or, complimentary, to, an, interval, although, equivalent, expressions, may, have, different, implications, e, g, every, 8, hours, versus, 3, times, a, day, in, the, fields, of, medicine, biotechnology, and, pharmacology, drug, discovery, is, the, process, by, which, new, drugs, are, discovered, historically, drugs, were, discovered, by, identifying, the, active, ingredient, from, traditional, remedies, or, by, serendipitous, discovery, later, chemical, libraries, of, synthetic, small, molecules, natural, products, or, extracts, were, screened, in, intact, cells, or, whole, organisms, to, identify, substances, that, have, a, desirable, therapeutic, effect, in, a, process, known, as, classical, pharmacology, since, sequencing, of, the, human, genome, which, allowed, rapid, cloning, and, synthesis, of, large, quantities, of, purified, proteins, it, has, become, common, practice, to, use, high, throughput, screening, of, large, compound, libraries, against, isolated, biological, targets, which, are, hypothesized, to, be, disease, modifying, in, a, process, known, as, reverse, pharmacology, hits, from, these, screens, are, then, tested, in, cells, and, then, in, animals, for, efficacy, even, more, recently, scientists, have, been, able, to, understand, the, shape, of, biological, molecules, at, the, atomic, level, and, to, use, that, knowledge, to, design, see, drug, design, drug, candidates, modern, drug, discovery, involves, the, identification, of, screening, hits, medicinal, chemistry, and, optimization, of, those, hits, to, increase, the, affinity, selectivity, to, reduce, the, potential, of, side, effects, efficacy, potency, metabolic, stability, to, increase, the, half, life, and, oral, bioavailability, once, a, compound, that, fulfills, all, of, these, requirements, has, been, identified, it, will, begin, the, process, of, drug, development, prior, to, clinical, trials, one, or, more, of, these, steps, may, but, not, necessarily, involve, computer, aided, drug, design, despite, advances, in, technology, and, understanding, of, biological, systems, drug, discovery, is, still, a, lengthy, expensive, difficult, and, inefficient, process, with, a, low, rate, of, new, therapeutic, discovery, in, 2010, the, research, and, development, cost, of, each, new, molecular, entity, nme, was, approximately, us, 1, 8, billion, drug, discovery, is, done, by, pharmaceutical, companies, sometimes, with, research, assistance, from, universities, the, final, product, of, drug, discovery, is, a, patent, on, the, potential, drug, the, drug, requires, very, expensive, phase, i, ii, and, iii, clinical, trials, and, most, of, them, fail, small, companies, have, a, critical, role, often, then, selling, the, rights, to, larger, companies, that, have, the, resources, to, run, the, clinical, trials, drug, discovery, is, different, from, drug, development, drug, discovery, is, often, considered, the, process, of, identifying, new, medicine, at, the, same, time, drug, development, is, delivering, a, new, drug, molecule, into, clinical, practice, in, its, broad, definition, this, encompasses, all, steps, from, the, basic, research, process, of, finding, a, suitable, molecular, target, to, supporting, the, drug, s, commercial, launch, drug, development, is, the, process, of, bringing, a, new, drug, to, the, market, once, a, lead, compound, has, been, identified, through, the, process, of, drug, discovery, it, includes, pre, clinical, research, microorganisms, animals, and, clinical, trials, on, humans, and, may, include, the, step, of, obtaining, regulatory, approval, to, market, the, drug, drug, development, process, discovery, the, drug, development, process, starts, with, discovery, a, process, of, identifying, a, new, medicine, development, chemicals, extracted, from, natural, products, are, used, to, make, pills, capsules, or, syrups, for, oral, use, injections, for, direct, infusion, into, the, blood, drops, for, eyes, or, ears, preclinical, research, drugs, go, under, laboratory, or, animal, testing, to, ensure, that, they, can, be, used, on, humans, clinical, testing, the, drug, is, used, on, people, to, confirm, that, it, is, safe, to, use, fda, review, drug, is, sent, to, fda, before, launching, the, drug, into, the, market, fda, post, market, review, the, drug, is, reviewed, and, monitored, by, fda, for, the, safety, once, it, is, available, to, the, public, the, regulation, of, drugs, varies, by, jurisdiction, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, states, they, are, regulated, at, the, national, level, by, a, single, agency, in, other, jurisdictions, they, are, regulated, at, the, state, level, or, at, both, state, and, national, levels, by, various, bodies, as, is, the, case, in, australia, the, role, of, therapeutic, goods, regulation, is, designed, mainly, to, protect, the, health, and, safety, of, the, population, regulation, is, aimed, at, ensuring, the, safety, quality, and, efficacy, of, the, therapeutic, goods, which, are, covered, under, the, scope, of, the, regulation, in, most, jurisdictions, therapeutic, goods, must, be, registered, before, they, are, allowed, to, be, marketed, there, is, usually, some, degree, of, restriction, on, the, availability, of, certain, therapeutic, goods, depending, on, their, risk, to, consumers, depending, upon, the, jurisdiction, drugs, may, be, divided, into, over, the, counter, drugs, otc, which, may, be, available, without, special, restrictions, and, prescription, drugs, which, must, be, prescribed, by, a, licensed, medical, practitioner, in, accordance, with, medical, guidelines, due, to, the, risk, of, adverse, effects, and, contraindications, the, precise, distinction, between, otc, and, prescription, depends, on, the, legal, jurisdiction, a, third, category, behind, the, counter, drugs, is, implemented, in, some, jurisdictions, these, do, not, require, a, prescription, but, must, be, kept, in, the, dispensary, not, visible, to, the, public, and, be, sold, only, by, a, pharmacist, or, pharmacy, technician, doctors, may, also, prescribe, prescription, drugs, for, off, label, use, purposes, which, the, drugs, were, not, originally, approved, for, by, the, regulatory, agency, the, classification, of, pharmaco, therapeutic, referrals, helps, guide, the, referral, process, between, pharmacists, and, doctors, the, international, narcotics, control, board, of, the, united, nations, imposes, a, world, law, of, prohibition, of, certain, drugs, they, publish, a, lengthy, list, of, chemicals, and, plants, whose, trade, and, consumption, where, applicable, are, forbidden, otc, drugs, are, sold, without, restriction, as, they, are, considered, safe, enough, that, most, people, will, not, hurt, themselves, accidentally, by, taking, it, as, instructed, many, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, have, a, third, category, of, pharmacy, medicines, which, can, be, sold, only, in, registered, pharmacies, by, or, under, the, supervision, of, a, pharmacist, medical, errors, include, over, prescription, and, polypharmacy, mis, prescription, contraindication, and, lack, of, detail, in, dosage, and, administration, instructions, in, 2000, the, definition, of, a, prescription, error, was, studied, using, a, delphi, method, conference, the, conference, was, motivated, by, ambiguity, in, what, a, prescription, error, is, and, a, need, to, use, a, uniform, definition, in, studies, in, many, jurisdictions, drug, prices, are, regulated, in, the, uk, the, pharmaceutical, price, regulation, scheme, is, intended, to, ensure, that, the, national, health, service, is, able, to, purchase, drugs, at, reasonable, prices, the, prices, are, negotiated, between, the, department, of, health, acting, with, the, authority, of, northern, ireland, and, the, uk, government, and, the, representatives, of, the, pharmaceutical, industry, brands, the, association, of, the, british, pharmaceutical, industry, abpi, for, 2017, this, payment, percentage, set, by, the, pprs, will, be, 4, 75, in, canada, the, patented, medicine, prices, review, board, examines, drug, pricing, and, determines, if, a, price, is, excessive, or, not, in, these, circumstances, drug, manufacturers, must, submit, a, proposed, price, to, the, appropriate, regulatory, agency, furthermore, the, international, therapeutic, class, comparison, test, is, responsible, for, comparing, the, national, average, transaction, price, of, the, patented, drug, product, under, review, different, countries, that, the, prices, are, being, compared, to, are, the, following, france, germany, italy, sweden, switzerland, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, in, brazil, the, prices, are, regulated, through, legislation, under, the, name, of, medicamento, gen, rico, generic, drugs, since, 1999, in, india, drug, prices, are, regulated, by, the, national, pharmaceutical, pricing, authority, in, the, united, states, drug, costs, are, partially, unregulated, but, instead, are, the, result, of, negotiations, between, drug, companies, and, insurance, companies, high, prices, have, been, attributed, to, monopolies, given, to, manufacturers, by, the, government, new, drug, development, costs, continue, to, rise, as, well, despite, the, enormous, advances, in, science, and, technology, the, number, of, new, blockbuster, drugs, approved, by, the, government, per, billion, dollars, spent, has, halved, every, 9, years, since, 1950, a, blockbuster, drug, is, a, drug, that, generates, more, than, 1, billion, in, revenue, for, a, pharmaceutical, company, in, a, single, year, cimetidine, was, the, first, drug, ever, to, reach, more, than, 1, billion, a, year, in, sales, thus, making, it, the, first, blockbuster, drug, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, a, blockbuster, drug, is, one, that, achieves, acceptance, by, prescribing, physicians, as, a, therapeutic, standard, for, most, commonly, a, highly, prevalent, chronic, rather, than, acute, condition, patients, often, take, the, medicines, for, long, periods, antibiotics, first, arrived, on, the, medical, scene, in, 1932, thanks, to, gerhard, domagk, and, were, coined, the, wonder, drugs, the, introduction, of, the, sulfa, drugs, led, to, the, mortality, rate, from, pneumonia, in, the, u, s, to, drop, from, 0, 2, each, year, to, 0, 05, by, 1939, antibiotics, inhibit, the, growth, or, the, metabolic, activities, of, bacteria, and, other, microorganisms, by, a, chemical, substance, of, microbial, origin, penicillin, introduced, a, few, years, later, provided, a, broader, spectrum, of, activity, compared, to, sulfa, drugs, and, reduced, side, effects, streptomycin, found, in, 1942, proved, to, be, the, first, drug, effective, against, the, cause, of, tuberculosis, and, also, came, to, be, the, best, known, of, a, long, series, of, important, antibiotics, a, second, generation, of, antibiotics, was, introduced, in, the, 1940s, aureomycin, and, chloramphenicol, aureomycin, was, the, best, known, of, the, second, generation, lithium, was, discovered, in, the, 19th, century, for, nervous, disorders, and, its, possible, mood, stabilizing, or, prophylactic, effect, it, was, cheap, and, easily, produced, as, lithium, fell, out, of, favor, in, france, valpromide, came, into, play, this, antibiotic, was, the, origin, of, the, drug, that, eventually, created, the, mood, stabilizer, category, valpromide, had, distinct, psychotrophic, effects, that, were, of, benefit, in, both, the, treatment, of, acute, manic, states, and, in, the, maintenance, treatment, of, manic, depression, illness, psychotropics, can, either, be, sedative, or, stimulant, sedatives, aim, at, damping, down, the, extremes, of, behavior, stimulants, aim, at, restoring, normality, by, increasing, tone, soon, arose, the, notion, of, a, tranquilizer, which, was, quite, different, from, any, sedative, or, stimulant, the, term, tranquilizer, took, over, the, notions, of, sedatives, and, became, the, dominant, term, in, the, west, through, the, 1980s, in, japan, during, this, time, the, term, tranquilizer, produced, the, notion, of, a, psyche, stabilizer, and, the, term, mood, stabilizer, vanished, premarin, conjugated, estrogens, introduced, in, 1942, and, prempro, a, combination, estrogen, progestin, pill, introduced, in, 1995, dominated, the, hormone, replacement, therapy, hrt, during, the, 1990s, hrt, is, not, a, life, saving, drug, nor, does, it, cure, any, disease, hrt, has, been, prescribed, to, improve, one, s, quality, of, life, doctors, prescribe, estrogen, for, their, older, female, patients, both, to, treat, short, term, menopausal, symptoms, and, to, prevent, long, term, diseases, in, the, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, more, and, more, physicians, began, to, prescribe, estrogen, for, their, female, patients, between, 1991, and, 1999, premarin, was, listed, as, the, most, popular, prescription, and, best, selling, drug, in, america, the, first, oral, contraceptive, enovid, was, approved, by, fda, in, 1960, oral, contraceptives, inhibit, ovulation, and, so, prevent, conception, enovid, was, known, to, be, much, more, effective, than, alternatives, including, the, condom, and, the, diaphragm, as, early, as, 1960, oral, contraceptives, were, available, in, several, different, strengths, by, every, manufacturer, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, an, increasing, number, of, options, arose, including, most, recently, a, new, delivery, system, for, the, oral, contraceptive, via, a, transdermal, patch, in, 1982, a, new, version, of, the, pill, was, introduced, known, as, the, biphasic, pill, by, 1985, a, new, triphasic, pill, was, approved, physicians, began, to, think, of, the, pill, as, an, excellent, means, of, birth, control, for, young, women, stimulants, such, as, ritalin, methylphenidate, came, to, be, pervasive, tools, for, behavior, management, and, modification, in, young, children, ritalin, was, first, marketed, in, 1955, for, narcolepsy, its, potential, users, were, middle, aged, and, the, elderly, it, was, not, until, some, time, in, the, 1980s, along, with, hyperactivity, in, children, that, ritalin, came, onto, the, market, medical, use, of, methylphenidate, is, predominantly, for, symptoms, of, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, consumption, of, methylphenidate, in, the, u, s, out, paced, all, other, countries, between, 1991, and, 1999, significant, growth, in, consumption, was, also, evident, in, canada, new, zealand, australia, and, norway, currently, 85, of, the, world, s, methylphenidate, is, consumed, in, america, the, first, minor, tranquilizer, was, meprobamate, only, fourteen, months, after, it, was, made, available, meprobamate, had, become, the, country, s, largest, selling, prescription, drug, by, 1957, meprobamate, had, become, the, fastest, growing, drug, in, history, the, popularity, of, meprobamate, paved, the, way, for, librium, and, valium, two, minor, tranquilizers, that, belonged, to, a, new, chemical, class, of, drugs, called, the, benzodiazepines, these, were, drugs, that, worked, chiefly, as, anti, anxiety, agents, and, muscle, relaxants, the, first, benzodiazepine, was, librium, three, months, after, it, was, approved, librium, had, become, the, most, prescribed, tranquilizer, in, the, nation, three, years, later, valium, hit, the, shelves, and, was, ten, times, more, effective, as, a, muscle, relaxant, and, anti, convulsant, valium, was, the, most, versatile, of, the, minor, tranquilizers, later, came, the, widespread, adoption, of, major, tranquilizers, such, as, chlorpromazine, and, the, drug, reserpine, in, 1970, sales, began, to, decline, for, valium, and, librium, but, sales, of, new, and, improved, tranquilizers, such, as, xanax, introduced, in, 1981, for, the, newly, created, diagnosis, of, panic, disorder, soared, mevacor, lovastatin, is, the, first, and, most, influential, statin, in, the, american, market, the, 1991, launch, of, pravachol, pravastatin, the, second, available, in, the, united, states, and, the, release, of, zocor, simvastatin, made, mevacor, no, longer, the, only, statin, on, the, market, in, 1998, viagra, was, released, as, a, treatment, for, erectile, dysfunction, using, plants, and, plant, substances, to, treat, all, kinds, of, diseases, and, medical, conditions, is, believed, to, date, back, to, prehistoric, medicine, the, kahun, gynaecological, papyrus, the, oldest, known, medical, text, of, any, kind, dates, to, about, 1800, bc, and, represents, the, first, documented, use, of, any, kind, of, drug, it, and, other, medical, papyri, describe, ancient, egyptian, medical, practices, such, as, using, honey, to, treat, infections, and, the, legs, of, bee, eaters, to, treat, neck, pains, ancient, babylonian, medicine, demonstrated, the, use, of, medication, in, the, first, half, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, medicinal, creams, and, pills, were, employed, as, treatments, on, the, indian, subcontinent, the, atharvaveda, a, sacred, text, of, hinduism, whose, core, dates, from, the, second, millennium, bc, although, the, hymns, recorded, in, it, are, believed, to, be, older, is, the, first, indic, text, dealing, with, medicine, it, describes, plant, based, drugs, to, counter, diseases, the, earliest, foundations, of, ayurveda, were, built, on, a, synthesis, of, selected, ancient, herbal, practices, together, with, a, massive, addition, of, theoretical, conceptualizations, new, nosologies, and, new, therapies, dating, from, about, 400, bc, onwards, the, student, of, yurveda, was, expected, to, know, ten, arts, that, were, indispensable, in, the, preparation, and, application, of, his, medicines, distillation, operative, skills,

medieval, medicine, of, western, europe, saw, advances, in, surgery, compared, to, previously, but, few, truly, effective, drugs, existed, beyond, opium, found, in, such, extremely, popular, drugs, as, the, great, rest, of, the, antidotarium, nicolai, at, the, time, and, quinine, folklore, cures, and, potentially, poisonous, metal, based, compounds, were, popular, treatments, theodoric, borgognoni, 1205, 1296, one, of, the, most, significant, surgeons, of, the, medieval, period, responsible, for, introducing, and, promoting, important, surgical, advances, including, basic, antiseptic, practice, and, the, use, of, anaesthetics, garcia, de, orta, described, some, herbal, treatments, that, were, used, for, most, of, the, 19th, century, drugs, were, not, highly, effective, leading, oliver, wendell, holmes, sr, to, famously, comment, in, 1842, that, if, all, medicines, in, the, world, were, thrown, into, the, sea, it, would, be, all, the, better, for, mankind, and, all, the, worse, for, the, fishes, 21, during, the, first, world, war, alexis, carrel, and, henry, dakin, developed, the, carrel, dakin, method, of, treating, wounds, with, an, irrigation, dakin, s, solution, a, germicide, which, helped, prevent, gangrene, in, the, inter, war, period, the, first, anti, bacterial, agents, such, as, the, sulpha, antibiotics, were, developed, the, second, world, war, saw, the, introduction, of, widespread, and, effective, antimicrobial, therapy, with, the, development, and, mass, production, of, penicillin, antibiotics, made, possible, by, the, pressures, of, the, war, and, the, collaboration, of, british, scientists, with, the, american, pharmaceutical, industry, medicines, commonly, used, by, the, late, 1920s, included, aspirin, codeine, and, morphine, for, pain, digitalis, nitroglycerin, and, quinine, for, heart, disorders, and, insulin, for, diabetes, other, drugs, included, antitoxins, a, few, biological, vaccines, and, a, few, synthetic, drugs, in, the, 1930s, antibiotics, emerged, first, sulfa, drugs, then, penicillin, and, other, antibiotics, drugs, increasingly, became, the, center, of, medical, practice, 22, in, the, 1950s, other, drugs, emerged, including, corticosteroids, for, inflammation, rauvolfia, alkaloids, as, tranquilizers, and, antihypertensives, antihistamines, for, nasal, allergies, xanthines, for, asthma, and, typical, antipsychotics, for, psychosis, 23, 24, as, of, 2007, thousands, of, approved, drugs, have, been, developed, increasingly, biotechnology, is, used, to, discover, biopharmaceuticals, recently, multi, disciplinary, approaches, have, yielded, a, wealth, of, new, data, on, the, development, of, novel, antibiotics, and, antibacterials, and, on, the, use, of, biological, agents, for, antibacterial, therapy, in, the, 1950s, new, psychiatric, drugs, notably, the, antipsychotic, chlorpromazine, were, designed, in, laboratories, and, slowly, came, into, preferred, use, although, often, accepted, as, an, advance, in, some, ways, there, was, some, opposition, due, to, serious, adverse, effects, such, as, tardive, dyskinesia, patients, often, opposed, psychiatry, and, refused, or, stopped, taking, the, drugs, when, not, subject, to, psychiatric, control, governments, have, been, heavily, involved, in, the, regulation, of, drug, development, and, drug, sales, in, the, u, s, the, elixir, sulfanilamide, disaster, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, food, and, drug, administration, and, the, 1938, federal, food, drug, and, cosmetic, act, required, manufacturers, to, file, new, drugs, with, the, fda, the, 1951, humphrey, durham, amendment, required, certain, drugs, to, be, sold, by, prescription, in, 1962, a, subsequent, amendment, required, new, drugs, to, be, tested, for, efficacy, and, safety, in, clinical, trials, 24, 26, until, the, 1970s, drug, prices, were, not, a, major, concern, for, doctors, and, patients, as, more, drugs, became, prescribed, for, chronic, illnesses, however, costs, became, burdensome, and, by, the, 1970s, nearly, every, u, s, state, required, or, encouraged, the, substitution, of, generic, drugs, for, higher, priced, brand, names, this, also, led, to, the, 2006, u, s, law, medicare, part, d, which, offers, medicare, coverage, for, drugs, 28, 29, as, of, 2008, the, united, states, is, the, leader, in, medical, research, including, pharmaceutical, development, u, s, drug, prices, are, among, the, highest, in, the, world, and, drug, innovation, is, correspondingly, high, in, 2000, u, s, based, firms, developed, 29, of,

throughout, the, 1990s, outcomes, were, similar, 30, 31, controversies, concerning, pharmaceutical, drugs, include, patient, access, to, drugs, under, development, and, not, yet, approved, pricing, and, environmental, issues, governments, worldwide, have, created, provisions, for, granting, access, to, drugs, prior, to, approval, for, patients, who, have, exhausted, all, alternative, treatment, options, and, do, not, match, clinical, trial, entry, criteria, often, grouped, under, the, labels, of, compassionate, use, expanded, access, or, named, patient, supply, these, programs, are, governed, by, rules, which, vary, by, country, defining, access, criteria, data, collection, promotion, and, control, of, drug, distribution, within, the, united, states, pre, approval, demand, is, generally, met, through, treatment, ind, investigational, new, drug, applications, inds, or, single, patient, inds, these, mechanisms, which, fall, under, the, label, of, expanded, access, programs, provide, access, to, drugs, for, groups, of, patients, or, individuals, residing, in, the, us, outside, the, us, named, patient, programs, provide, controlled, pre, approval, access, to, drugs, in, response, to, requests, by, physicians, on, behalf, of, specific, or, named, patients, before, those, medicines, are, licensed, in, the, patient, s, home, country, through, these, programs, patients, are, able, to, access, drugs, in, late, stage, clinical, trials, or, approved, in, other, countries, for, a, genuine, unmet, medical, need, before, those, drugs, have, been, licensed, in, the, patient, s, home, country, patients, who, have, not, been, able, to, get, access, to, drugs, in, development, have, organized, and, advocated, for, greater, access, in, the, united, states, act, up, formed, in, the, 1980s, and, eventually, formed, its, treatment, action, group, in, part, to, pressure, the, us, government, to, put, more, resources, into, discovering, treatments, for, aids, and, then, to, speed, release, of, drugs, that, were, under, development, the, abigail, alliance, was, established, in, november, 2001, by, frank, burroughs, in, memory, of, his, daughter, abigail, the, alliance, seeks, broader, availability, of, investigational, drugs, on, behalf, of, terminally, ill, patients, in, 2013, biomarin, pharmaceutical, was, at, the, center, of, a, high, profile, debate, regarding, expanded, access, of, cancer, patients, to, experimental, drugs, essential, medicines, as, defined, by, the, world, health, organization, who, are, those, drugs, that, satisfy, the, health, care, needs, of, the, majority, of, the, population, they, should, therefore, be, available, at, all, times, in, adequate, amounts, and, in, appropriate, dosage, forms, at, a, price, the, community, can, afford, recent, studies, have, found, that, most, of, the, medicines, on, the, who, essential, medicines, list, outside, of, the, field, of, hiv, drugs, are, not, patented, in, the, developing, world, and, that, lack, of, widespread, access, to, these, medicines, arise, from, issues, fundamental, to, economic, development, lack, of, infrastructure, and, poverty, m, decins, sans, fronti, res, also, runs, a, campaign, for, access, to, essential, medicines, campaign, which, includes, advocacy, for, greater, resources, to, be, devoted, to, currently, untreatable, diseases, that, primarily, occur, in, the, developing, world, the, access, to, medicine, index, tracks, how, well, pharmaceutical, companies, make, their, products, available, in, the, developing, world, world, trade, organization, negotiations, in, the, 1990s, including, the, trips, agreement, and, the, doha, declaration, have, centered, on, issues, at, the, intersection, of, international, trade, in, pharmaceuticals, and, intellectual, property, rights, with, developed, world, nations, seeking, strong, intellectual, property, rights, to, protect, investments, made, to, develop, new, drugs, and, developing, world, nations, seeking, to, promote, their, generic, pharmaceuticals, industries, and, their, ability, to, make, medicine, available, to, their, people, via, compulsory, licenses, some, have, raised, ethical, objections, specifically, with, respect, to, pharmaceutical, patents, and, the, high, prices, for, drugs, that, they, enable, their, proprietors, to, charge, which, poor, people, around, the, world, cannot, afford, critics, also, question, the, rationale, that, exclusive, patent, rights, and, the, resulting, high, prices, are, required, for, pharmaceutical, companies, to, recoup, the, large, investments, needed, for, research, and, development, one, study, concluded, that, marketing, expenditures, for, new, drugs, often, doubled, the, amount, that, was, allocated, for, research, and, development, other, critics, claim, that, patent, settlements, would, be, costly, for, consumers, the, health, care, system, and, state, and, federal, governments, because, it, would, result, in, delaying, access, to, lower, cost, generic, medicines, novartis, fought, a, protracted, battle, with, the, government, of, india, over, the, patenting, of, its, drug, gleevec, in, india, which, ended, up, in, a, supreme, court, in, a, case, known, as, novartis, v, union, of, india, others, the, supreme, court, ruled, narrowly, against, novartis, but, opponents, of, patenting, drugs, claimed, it, as, a, major, victory, pharmaceutical, medications, are, commonly, described, as, ubiquitous, in, nearly, every, type, of, environmental, medium, i, e, lakes, rivers, streams, estuaries, seawater, and, soil, worldwide, their, chemical, components, are, typically, present, at, relatively, low, concentrations, in, the, ng, l, to, g, l, ranges, the, primary, avenue, for, medications, reaching, the, environment, are, through, the, effluent, of, wastewater, treatment, plants, both, from, industrial, plants, during, production, and, from, municipal, plants, after, consumption, agricultural, pollution, is, another, significant, source, derived, from, the, prevalence, of, antibiotic, use, in, livestock, scientists, generally, divide, environmental, impacts, of, a, chemical, into, three, primary, categories, persistence, bioaccumulation, and, toxicity, since, medications, are, inherently, bio, active, most, are, naturally, degradable, in, the, environment, however, they, are, classified, as, pseudopersistent, because, they, are, constantly, being, replenished, from, their, sources, these, environmentally, persistent, pharmaceutical, pollutants, eppps, rarely, reach, toxic, concentrations, in, the, environment, however, they, have, been, known, to, bioaccumulate, in, some, species, their, effects, have, been, observed, to, compound, gradually, across, food, webs, rather, than, becoming, acute, leading, to, their, classification, by, the, us, geological, survey, as, ecological, disrupting, compounds
