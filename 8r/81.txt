the, brain, is, an, organ, that, serves, as, the, center, of, the, nervous, system, in, all, vertebrate, and, most, invertebrate, animals, it, consists, of, nervous, tissue, and, is, typically, located, in, the, head, cephalization, usually, near, organs, for, special, senses, such, as, vision, hearing, and, olfaction, being, the, most, specialized, organ, it, is, responsible, for, receiving, information, from, the, sensory, nervous, system, processing, those, information, thought, cognition, and, intelligence, and, the, coordination, of, motor, control, muscle, activity, and, endocrine, system, while, invertebrate, brains, arise, from, paired, segmental, ganglia, each, of, which, is, only, responsible, for, the, respective, body, segment, of, the, ventral, nerve, cord, vertebrate, brains, develop, axially, from, the, midline, dorsal, nerve, cord, as, a, vesicular, enlargement, at, the, rostral, end, of, the, neural, tube, with, centralized, control, over, all, body, segments, all, vertebrate, brains, can, be, embryonically, divided, into, three, parts, the, forebrain, prosencephalon, subdivided, into, telencephalon, and, diencephalon, midbrain, mesencephalon, and, hindbrain, rhombencephalon, subdivided, into, metencephalon, and, myelencephalon, the, spinal, cord, which, directly, interacts, with, somatic, functions, below, the, head, can, be, considered, a, caudal, extension, of, the, myelencephalon, enclosed, inside, the, vertebral, column, together, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, constitute, the, central, nervous, system, in, all, vertebrates, in, humans, the, cerebral, cortex, contains, approximately, 14, 16, billion, neurons, and, the, estimated, number, of, neurons, in, the, cerebellum, is, 55, 70, billion, each, neuron, is, connected, by, synapses, to, several, thousand, other, neurons, typically, communicating, with, one, another, via, root, like, protrusions, called, dendrites, and, long, fiber, like, extensions, called, axons, which, are, usually, myelinated, and, carry, trains, of, rapid, micro, electric, signal, pulses, called, action, potentials, to, target, specific, recipient, cells, in, other, areas, of, the, brain, or, distant, parts, of, the, body, the, prefrontal, cortex, which, controls, executive, functions, is, particularly, well, developed, in, humans, physiologically, brains, exert, centralized, control, over, a, body, s, other, organs, they, act, on, the, rest, of, the, body, both, by, generating, patterns, of, muscle, activity, and, by, driving, the, secretion, of, chemicals, called, hormones, this, centralized, control, allows, rapid, and, coordinated, responses, to, changes, in, the, environment, some, basic, types, of, responsiveness, such, as, reflexes, can, be, mediated, by, the, spinal, cord, or, peripheral, ganglia, but, sophisticated, purposeful, control, of, behavior, based, on, complex, sensory, input, requires, the, information, integrating, capabilities, of, a, centralized, brain, the, operations, of, individual, brain, cells, are, now, understood, in, considerable, detail, but, the, way, they, cooperate, in, ensembles, of, millions, is, yet, to, be, solved, recent, models, in, modern, neuroscience, treat, the, brain, as, a, biological, computer, very, different, in, mechanism, from, a, digital, computer, but, similar, in, the, sense, that, it, acquires, information, from, the, surrounding, world, stores, it, and, processes, it, in, a, variety, of, ways, this, article, compares, the, properties, of, brains, across, the, entire, range, of, animal, species, with, the, greatest, attention, to, vertebrates, it, deals, with, the, human, brain, insofar, as, it, shares, the, properties, of, other, brains, the, ways, in, which, the, human, brain, differs, from, other, brains, are, covered, in, the, human, brain, article, several, topics, that, might, be, covered, here, are, instead, covered, there, because, much, more, can, be, said, about, them, in, a, human, context, the, most, important, that, are, covered, in, the, human, brain, article, are, brain, disease, and, the, effects, of, brain, damage, the, shape, and, size, of, the, brain, varies, greatly, between, species, and, identifying, common, features, is, often, difficult, nevertheless, there, are, a, number, of, principles, of, brain, architecture, that, apply, across, a, wide, range, of, species, some, aspects, of, brain, structure, are, common, to, almost, the, entire, range, of, animal, species, others, distinguish, advanced, brains, from, more, primitive, ones, or, distinguish, vertebrates, from, invertebrates, the, simplest, way, to, gain, information, about, brain, anatomy, is, by, visual, inspection, but, many, more, sophisticated, techniques, have, been, developed, brain, tissue, in, its, natural, state, is, too, soft, to, work, with, but, it, can, be, hardened, by, immersion, in, alcohol, or, other, fixatives, and, then, sliced, apart, for, examination, of, the, interior, visually, the, interior, of, the, brain, consists, of, areas, of, so, called, grey, matter, with, a, dark, color, separated, by, areas, of, white, matter, with, a, lighter, color, further, information, can, be, gained, by, staining, slices, of, brain, tissue, with, a, variety, of, chemicals, that, bring, out, areas, where, specific, types, of, molecules, are, present, in, high, concentrations, it, is, also, possible, to, examine, the, microstructure, of, brain, tissue, using, a, microscope, and, to, trace, the, pattern, of, connections, from, one, brain, area, to, another, the, brains, of, all, species, are, composed, primarily, of, two, broad, classes, of, cells, neurons, and, glial, cells, glial, cells, also, known, as, glia, or, neuroglia, come, in, several, types, and, perform, a, number, of, critical, functions, including, structural, support, metabolic, support, insulation, and, guidance, of, development, neurons, however, are, usually, considered, the, most, important, cells, in, the, brain, the, property, that, makes, neurons, unique, is, their, ability, to, send, signals, to, specific, target, cells, over, long, distances, they, send, these, signals, by, means, of, an, axon, which, is, a, thin, protoplasmic, fiber, that, extends, from, the, cell, body, and, projects, usually, with, numerous, branches, to, other, areas, sometimes, nearby, sometimes, in, distant, parts, of, the, brain, or, body, the, length, of, an, axon, can, be, extraordinary, for, example, if, a, pyramidal, cell, an, excitatory, neuron, of, the, cerebral, cortex, were, magnified, so, that, its, cell, body, became, the, size, of, a, human, body, its, axon, equally, magnified, would, become, a, cable, a, few, centimeters, in, diameter, extending, more, than, a, kilometer, these, axons, transmit, signals, in, the, form, of, electrochemical, pulses, called, action, potentials, which, last, less, than, a, thousandth, of, a, second, and, travel, along, the, axon, at, speeds, of, 1, 100, meters, per, second, some, neurons, emit, action, potentials, constantly, at, rates, of, 10, 100, per, second, usually, in, irregular, patterns, other, neurons, are, quiet, most, of, the, time, but, occasionally, emit, a, burst, of, action, potentials, axons, transmit, signals, to, other, neurons, by, means, of, specialized, junctions, called, synapses, a, single, axon, may, make, as, many, as, several, thousand, synaptic, connections, with, other, cells, when, an, action, potential, traveling, along, an, axon, arrives, at, a, synapse, it, causes, a, chemical, called, a, neurotransmitter, to, be, released, the, neurotransmitter, binds, to, receptor, molecules, in, the, membrane, of, the, target, cell, synapses, are, the, key, functional, elements, of, the, brain, the, essential, function, of, the, brain, is, cell, to, cell, communication, and, synapses, are, the, points, at, which, communication, occurs, the, human, brain, has, been, estimated, to, contain, approximately, 100, trillion, synapses, even, the, brain, of, a, fruit, fly, contains, several, million, the, functions, of, these, synapses, are, very, diverse, some, are, excitatory, exciting, the, target, cell, others, are, inhibitory, others, work, by, activating, second, messenger, systems, that, change, the, internal, chemistry, of, their, target, cells, in, complex, ways, a, large, number, of, synapses, are, dynamically, modifiable, that, is, they, are, capable, of, changing, strength, in, a, way, that, is, controlled, by, the, patterns, of, signals, that, pass, through, them, it, is, widely, believed, that, activity, dependent, modification, of, synapses, is, the, brain, s, primary, mechanism, for, learning, and, memory, most, of, the, space, in, the, brain, is, taken, up, by, axons, which, are, often, bundled, together, in, what, are, called, nerve, fiber, tracts, a, myelinated, axon, is, wrapped, in, a, fatty, insulating, sheath, of, myelin, which, serves, to, greatly, increase, the, speed, of, signal, propagation, there, are, also, unmyelinated, axons, myelin, is, white, making, parts, of, the, brain, filled, exclusively, with, nerve, fibers, appear, as, light, colored, white, matter, in, contrast, to, the, darker, colored, grey, matter, that, marks, areas, with, high, densities, of, neuron, cell, bodies, except, for, a, few, primitive, organisms, such, as, sponges, which, have, no, nervous, system, and, cnidarians, which, have, a, diffuse, nervous, system, consisting, of, a, nerve, net, all, living, multicellular, animals, are, bilaterians, meaning, animals, with, a, bilaterally, symmetric, body, plan, that, is, left, and, right, sides, that, are, approximate, mirror, images, of, each, other, all, bilaterians, are, thought, to, have, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, that, appeared, late, in, the, cryogenian, period, 700, 650, million, years, ago, and, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, this, common, ancestor, had, the, shape, of, a, simple, tubeworm, with, a, segmented, body, at, a, schematic, level, that, basic, worm, shape, continues, to, be, reflected, in, the, body, and, nervous, system, architecture, of, all, modern, bilaterians, including, vertebrates, the, fundamental, bilateral, body, form, is, a, tube, with, a, hollow, gut, cavity, running, from, the, mouth, to, the, anus, and, a, nerve, cord, with, an, enlargement, a, ganglion, for, each, body, segment, with, an, especially, large, ganglion, at, the, front, called, the, brain, the, brain, is, small, and, simple, in, some, species, such, as, nematode, worms, in, other, species, such, as, vertebrates, it, is, a, large, and, very, complex, organ, some, types, of, worms, such, as, leeches, also, have, an, enlarged, ganglion, at, the, back, end, of, the, nerve, cord, known, as, a, tail, brain, there, are, a, few, types, of, existing, bilaterians, that, lack, a, recognizable, brain, including, echinoderms, and, tunicates, it, has, not, been, definitively, established, whether, the, existence, of, these, brainless, species, indicates, that, the, earliest, bilaterians, lacked, a, brain, or, whether, their, ancestors, evolved, in, a, way, that, led, to, the, disappearance, of, a, previously, existing, brain, structure, this, category, includes, tardigrades, arthropods, molluscs, and, numerous, types, of, worms, the, diversity, of, invertebrate, body, plans, is, matched, by, an, equal, diversity, in, brain, structures, two, groups, of, invertebrates, have, notably, complex, brains, arthropods, insects, crustaceans, arachnids, and, others, and, cephalopods, octopuses, squids, and, similar, molluscs, the, brains, of, arthropods, and, cephalopods, arise, from, twin, parallel, nerve, cords, that, extend, through, the, body, of, the, animal, arthropods, have, a, central, brain, the, supraesophageal, ganglion, with, three, divisions, and, large, optical, lobes, behind, each, eye, for, visual, processing, cephalopods, such, as, the, octopus, and, squid, have, the, largest, brains, of, any, invertebrates, there, are, several, invertebrate, species, whose, brains, have, been, studied, intensively, because, they, have, properties, that, make, them, convenient, for, experimental, work, the, first, vertebrates, appeared, over, 500, million, years, ago, mya, during, the, cambrian, period, and, may, have, resembled, the, modern, hagfish, in, form, jawed, fish, appeared, by, 445, mya, amphibians, by, 350, mya, reptiles, by, 310, mya, and, mammals, by, 200, mya, approximately, each, species, has, an, equally, long, evolutionary, history, but, the, brains, of, modern, hagfishes, lampreys, sharks, amphibians, reptiles, and, mammals, show, a, gradient, of, size, and, complexity, that, roughly, follows, the, evolutionary, sequence, all, of, these, brains, contain, the, same, set, of, basic, anatomical, components, but, many, are, rudimentary, in, the, hagfish, whereas, in, mammals, the, foremost, part, the, telencephalon, is, greatly, elaborated, and, expanded, brains, are, most, commonly, compared, in, terms, of, their, size, the, relationship, between, brain, size, body, size, and, other, variables, has, been, studied, across, a, wide, range, of, vertebrate, species, as, a, rule, brain, size, increases, with, body, size, but, not, in, a, simple, linear, proportion, in, general, smaller, animals, tend, to, have, larger, brains, measured, as, a, fraction, of, body, size, for, mammals, the, relationship, between, brain, volume, and, body, mass, essentially, follows, a, power, law, with, an, exponent, of, about, 0, 75, this, formula, describes, the, central, tendency, but, every, family, of, mammals, departs, from, it, to, some, degree, in, a, way, that, reflects, in, part, the, complexity, of, their, behavior, for, example, primates, have, brains, 5, to, 10, times, larger, than, the, formula, predicts, predators, tend, to, have, larger, brains, than, their, prey, relative, to, body, size, all, vertebrate, brains, share, a, common, underlying, form, which, appears, most, clearly, during, early, stages, of, embryonic, development, in, its, earliest, form, the, brain, appears, as, three, swellings, at, the, front, end, of, the, neural, tube, these, swellings, eventually, become, the, forebrain, midbrain, and, hindbrain, the, prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and, rhombencephalon, respectively, at, the, earliest, stages, of, brain, development, the, three, areas, are, roughly, equal, in, size, in, many, classes, of, vertebrates, such, as, fish, and, amphibians, the, three, parts, remain, similar, in, size, in, the, adult, but, in, mammals, the, forebrain, becomes, much, larger, than, the, other, parts, and, the, midbrain, becomes, very, small, the, brains, of, vertebrates, are, made, of, very, soft, tissue, living, brain, tissue, is, pinkish, on, the, outside, and, mostly, white, on, the, inside, with, subtle, variations, in, color, vertebrate, brains, are, surrounded, by, a, system, of, connective, tissue, membranes, called, meninges, that, separate, the, skull, from, the, brain, blood, vessels, enter, the, central, nervous, system, through, holes, in, the, meningeal, layers, the, cells, in, the, blood, vessel, walls, are, joined, tightly, to, one, another, forming, the, blood, brain, barrier, which, blocks, the, passage, of, many, toxins, and, pathogens, though, at, the, same, time, blocking, antibodies, and, some, drugs, thereby, presenting, special, challenges, in, treatment, of, diseases, of, the, brain, neuroanatomists, usually, divide, the, vertebrate, brain, into, six, main, regions, the, telencephalon, cerebral, hemispheres, diencephalon, thalamus, and, hypothalamus, mesencephalon, midbrain, cerebellum, pons, and, medulla, oblongata, each, of, these, areas, has, a, complex, internal, structure, some, parts, such, as, the, cerebral, cortex, and, the, cerebellar, cortex, consist, of, layers, that, are, folded, or, convoluted, to, fit, within, the, available, space, other, parts, such, as, the, thalamus, and, hypothalamus, consist, of, clusters, of, many, small, nuclei, thousands, of, distinguishable, areas, can, be, identified, within, the, vertebrate, brain, based, on, fine, distinctions, of, neural, structure, chemistry, and, connectivity, although, the, same, basic, components, are, present, in, all, vertebrate, brains, some, branches, of, vertebrate, evolution, have, led, to, substantial, distortions, of, brain, geometry, especially, in, the, forebrain, area, the, brain, of, a, shark, shows, the, basic, components, in, a, straightforward, way, but, in, teleost, fishes, the, great, majority, of, existing, fish, species, the, forebrain, has, become, everted, like, a, sock, turned, inside, out, in, birds, there, are, also, major, changes, in, forebrain, structure, these, distortions, can, make, it, difficult, to, match, brain, components, from, one, species, with, those, of, another, species, here, is, a, list, of, some, of, the, most, important, vertebrate, brain, components, along, with, a, brief, description, of, their, functions, as, currently, understood, modern, reptiles, and, mammals, diverged, from, a, common, ancestor, around, 320, million, years, ago, interestingly, the, number, of, extant, reptiles, far, exceeds, the, number, of, mammalian, species, with, 11, 733, recognized, species, of, reptiles, compared, to, 5, 884, extant, mammals, along, with, the, species, diversity, reptiles, have, diverged, in, terms, of, external, morphology, from, limbless, to, tetrapod, gliders, to, armored, chelonians, reflecting, adaptive, radiation, to, a, diverse, array, of, environments, morphological, differences, are, reflected, in, the, nervous, system, phenotype, such, as, absence, of, lateral, motor, column, neurons, in, snakes, which, innervate, limb, muscles, controlling, limb, movements, absence, of, motor, neurons, that, innervate, trunk, muscles, in, tortoises, presence, of, innervation, from, the, trigeminal, nerve, to, pit, organs, responsible, to, infrared, detection, in, snakes, variation, in, size, weight, and, shape, of, the, brain, can, be, found, within, reptiles, for, instance, crocodilians, have, the, largest, brain, volume, to, body, weight, proportion, followed, by, turtles, lizards, and, snakes, reptiles, vary, in, the, investment, in, different, brain, sections, crocodilians, have, the, largest, telencephalon, while, snakes, have, the, smallest, turtles, have, the, largest, diencephalon, per, body, weight, whereas, crocodilians, have, the, smallest, on, the, other, hand, lizards, have, the, largest, mesencephalon, yet, their, brains, share, several, characteristics, revealed, by, recent, anatomical, molecular, and, ontogenetic, studies, vertebrates, share, the, highest, levels, of, similarities, during, embryological, development, controlled, by, conserved, transcription, factors, and, signaling, centers, including, gene, expression, morphological, and, cell, type, differentiation, in, fact, high, levels, of, transcriptional, factors, can, be, found, in, all, areas, of, the, brain, in, reptiles, and, mammals, with, shared, neuronal, clusters, enlightening, brain, evolution, conserved, transcription, factors, elucidate, that, evolution, acted, in, different, areas, of, the, brain, by, either, retaining, similar, morphology, and, function, or, diversifying, it, anatomically, the, reptilian, brain, has, less, subdivisions, than, the, mammalian, brain, however, it, has, numerous, conserved, aspects, including, the, organization, of, the, spinal, cord, and, cranial, nerve, as, well, as, elaborated, brain, pattern, of, organization, elaborated, brains, are, characterized, by, migrated, neuronal, cell, bodies, away, from, the, periventricular, matrix, region, of, neuronal, development, forming, organized, nuclear, groups, aside, from, reptiles, and, mammals, other, vertebrates, with, elaborated, brains, include, hagfish, galeomorph, sharks, skates, rays, teleosts, and, birds, overall, elaborated, brains, are, subdivided, in, forebrain, midbrain, and, hindbrain, the, hindbrain, coordinates, and, integrates, sensory, and, motor, inputs, and, outputs, responsible, for, but, not, limited, to, walking, swimming, or, flying, it, contains, input, and, output, axons, interconnecting, the, spinal, cord, midbrain, and, forebrain, transmitting, information, from, the, external, and, internal, environments, the, midbrain, links, sensory, motor, and, integrative, components, received, from, the, hindbrain, connecting, it, to, the, forebrain, the, tectum, which, includes, the, optic, tectum, and, torus, semicircularis, receives, auditory, visual, and, somatosensory, inputs, forming, integrated, maps, of, the, sensory, and, visual, space, around, the, animal, the, tegmentum, receives, incoming, sensory, information, and, forwards, motor, responses, to, and, from, the, forebrain, the, isthmus, connects, the, hindbrain, with, midbrain, the, forebrain, region, is, particularly, well, developed, is, further, divided, into, diencephalon, and, telencephalon, diencephalon, is, related, to, regulation, of, eye, and, body, movement, in, response, to, visual, stimuli, sensory, information, circadian, rhythms, olfactory, input, and, autonomic, nervous, system, telencephalon, is, related, to, control, of, movements, neurotransmitters, and, neuromodulators, responsible, for, integrating, inputs, and, transmitting, outputs, are, present, sensory, systems, and, cognitive, functions, the, avian, brain, is, the, central, organ, of, the, nervous, system, in, birds, birds, possess, large, complex, brains, which, process, integrate, and, coordinate, information, received, from, the, environment, and, make, decisions, on, how, to, respond, with, the, rest, of, the, body, like, in, all, chordates, the, avian, brain, is, contained, within, the, skull, bones, of, the, head, the, bird, brain, is, divided, into, a, number, of, sections, each, with, a, different, function, the, cerebrum, or, telencephalon, is, divided, into, two, hemispheres, and, controls, higher, functions, the, telencephalon, is, dominated, by, a, large, pallium, which, corresponds, to, the, mammalian, cerebral, cortex, and, is, responsible, for, the, cognitive, functions, of, birds, the, pallium, is, made, up, of, several, major, structures, the, hyperpallium, a, dorsal, bulge, of, the, pallium, found, only, in, birds, as, well, as, the, nidopallium, mesopallium, and, archipallium, the, bird, telencephalon, nuclear, structure, wherein, neurons, are, distributed, in, three, dimensionally, arranged, clusters, with, no, large, scale, separation, of, white, matter, and, grey, matter, though, there, exist, layer, like, and, column, like, connections, structures, in, the, pallium, are, associated, with, perception, learning, and, cognition, beneath, the, pallium, are, the, two, components, of, the, subpallium, the, striatum, and, pallidum, the, subpallium, connects, different, parts, of, the, telencephalon, and, plays, major, roles, in, a, number, of, critical, behaviours, to, the, rear, of, the, telencephalon, are, the, thalamus, midbrain, and, cerebellum, the, hindbrain, connects, the, rest, of, the, brain, to, the, spinal, cord, the, most, obvious, difference, between, the, brains, of, mammals, and, other, vertebrates, is, their, size, on, average, a, mammal, has, a, brain, roughly, twice, as, large, as, that, of, a, bird, of, the, same, body, size, and, ten, times, as, large, as, that, of, a, reptile, of, the, same, body, size, size, however, is, not, the, only, difference, there, are, also, substantial, differences, in, shape, the, hindbrain, and, midbrain, of, mammals, are, generally, similar, to, those, of, other, vertebrates, but, dramatic, differences, appear, in, the, forebrain, which, is, greatly, enlarged, and, also, altered, in, structure, the, cerebral, cortex, is, the, part, of, the, brain, that, most, strongly, distinguishes, mammals, in, non, mammalian, vertebrates, the, surface, of, the, cerebrum, is, lined, with, a, comparatively, simple, three, layered, structure, called, the, pallium, in, mammals, the, pallium, evolves, into, a, complex, six, layered, structure, called, neocortex, or, isocortex, several, areas, at, the, edge, of, the, neocortex, including, the, hippocampus, and, amygdala, are, also, much, more, extensively, developed, in, mammals, than, in, other, vertebrates, the, elaboration, of, the, cerebral, cortex, carries, with, it, changes, to, other, brain, areas, the, superior, colliculus, which, plays, a, major, role, in, visual, control, of, behavior, in, most, vertebrates, shrinks, to, a, small, size, in, mammals, and, many, of, its, functions, are, taken, over, by, visual, areas, of, the, cerebral, cortex, the, cerebellum, of, mammals, contains, a, large, portion, the, neocerebellum, dedicated, to, supporting, the, cerebral, cortex, which, has, no, counterpart, in, other, vertebrates, in, placental, mammals, there, is, a, wide, nerve, tract, connecting, the, cerebral, hemispheres, called, the, corpus, callosum, the, brains, of, humans, and, other, primates, contain, the, same, structures, as, the, brains, of, other, mammals, but, are, generally, larger, in, proportion, to, body, size, the, encephalization, quotient, eq, is, used, to, compare, brain, sizes, across, species, it, takes, into, account, the, nonlinearity, of, the, brain, to, body, relationship, humans, have, an, average, eq, in, the, 7, to, 8, range, while, most, other, primates, have, an, eq, in, the, 2, to, 3, range, dolphins, have, values, higher, than, those, of, primates, other, than, humans, but, nearly, all, other, mammals, have, eq, values, that, are, substantially, lower, most, of, the, enlargement, of, the, primate, brain, comes, from, a, massive, expansion, of, the, cerebral, cortex, especially, the, prefrontal, cortex, and, the, parts, of, the, cortex, involved, in, vision, the, visual, processing, network, of, primates, includes, at, least, 30, distinguishable, brain, areas, with, a, complex, web, of, interconnections, it, has, been, estimated, that, visual, processing, areas, occupy, more, than, half, of, the, total, surface, of, the, primate, neocortex, the, prefrontal, cortex, carries, out, functions, that, include, planning, working, memory, motivation, attention, and, executive, control, it, takes, up, a, much, larger, proportion, of, the, brain, for, primates, than, for, other, species, and, an, especially, large, fraction, of, the, human, brain, the, brain, develops, in, an, intricately, orchestrated, sequence, of, stages, it, changes, in, shape, from, a, simple, swelling, at, the, front, of, the, nerve, cord, in, the, earliest, embryonic, stages, to, a, complex, array, of, areas, and, connections, neurons, are, created, in, special, zones, that, contain, stem, cells, and, then, migrate, through, the, tissue, to, reach, their, ultimate, locations, once, neurons, have, positioned, themselves, their, axons, sprout, and, navigate, through, the, brain, branching, and, extending, as, they, go, until, the, tips, reach, their, targets, and, form, synaptic, connections, in, a, number, of, parts, of, the, nervous, system, neurons, and, synapses, are, produced, in, excessive, numbers, during, the, early, stages, and, then, the, unneeded, ones, are, pruned, away, for, vertebrates, the, early, stages, of, neural, development, are, similar, across, all, species, as, the, embryo, transforms, from, a, round, blob, of, cells, into, a, wormlike, structure, a, narrow, strip, of, ectoderm, running, along, the, midline, of, the, back, is, induced, to, become, the, neural, plate, the, precursor, of, the, nervous, system, the, neural, plate, folds, inward, to, form, the, neural, groove, and, then, the, lips, that, line, the, groove, merge, to, enclose, the, neural, tube, a, hollow, cord, of, cells, with, a, fluid, filled, ventricle, at, the, center, at, the, front, end, the, ventricles, and, cord, swell, to, form, three, vesicles, that, are, the, precursors, of, the, prosencephalon, forebrain, mesencephalon, midbrain, and, rhombencephalon, hindbrain, at, the, next, stage, the, forebrain, splits, into, two, vesicles, called, the, telencephalon, which, will, contain, the, cerebral, cortex, basal, ganglia, and, related, structures, and, the, diencephalon, which, will, contain, the, thalamus, and, hypothalamus, at, about, the, same, time, the, hindbrain, splits, into, the, metencephalon, which, will, contain, the, cerebellum, and, pons, and, the, myelencephalon, which, will, contain, the, medulla, oblongata, each, of, these, areas, contains, proliferative, zones, where, neurons, and, glial, cells, are, generated, the, resulting, cells, then, migrate, sometimes, for, long, distances, to, their, final, positions, once, a, neuron, is, in, place, it, extends, dendrites, and, an, axon, into, the, area, around, it, axons, because, they, commonly, extend, a, great, distance, from, the, cell, body, and, need, to, reach, specific, targets, grow, in, a, particularly, complex, way, the, tip, of, a, growing, axon, consists, of, a, blob, of, protoplasm, called, a, growth, cone, studded, with, chemical, receptors, these, receptors, sense, the, local, environment, causing, the, growth, cone, to, be, attracted, or, repelled, by, various, cellular, elements, and, thus, to, be, pulled, in, a, particular, direction, at, each, point, along, its, path, the, result, of, this, pathfinding, process, is, that, the, growth, cone, navigates, through, the, brain, until, it, reaches, its, destination, area, where, other, chemical, cues, cause, it, to, begin, generating, synapses, considering, the, entire, brain, thousands, of, genes, create, products, that, influence, axonal, pathfinding, the, synaptic, network, that, finally, emerges, is, only, partly, determined, by, genes, though, in, many, parts, of, the, brain, axons, initially, overgrow, and, then, are, pruned, by, mechanisms, that, depend, on, neural, activity, in, the, projection, from, the, eye, to, the, midbrain, for, example, the, structure, in, the, adult, contains, a, very, precise, mapping, connecting, each, point, on, the, surface, of, the, retina, to, a, corresponding, point, in, a, midbrain, layer, in, the, first, stages, of, development, each, axon, from, the, retina, is, guided, to, the, right, general, vicinity, in, the, midbrain, by, chemical, cues, but, then, branches, very, profusely, and, makes, initial, contact, with, a, wide, swath, of, midbrain, neurons, the, retina, before, birth, contains, special, mechanisms, that, cause, it, to, generate, waves, of, activity, that, originate, spontaneously, at, a, random, point, and, then, propagate, slowly, across, the, retinal, layer, these, waves, are, useful, because, they, cause, neighboring, neurons, to, be, active, at, the, same, time, that, is, they, produce, a, neural, activity, pattern, that, contains, information, about, the, spatial, arrangement, of, the, neurons, this, information, is, exploited, in, the, midbrain, by, a, mechanism, that, causes, synapses, to, weaken, and, eventually, vanish, if, activity, in, an, axon, is, not, followed, by, activity, of, the, target, cell, the, result, of, this, sophisticated, process, is, a, gradual, tuning, and, tightening, of, the, map, leaving, it, finally, in, its, precise, adult, form, similar, things, happen, in, other, brain, areas, an, initial, synaptic, matrix, is, generated, as, a, result, of, genetically, determined, chemical, guidance, but, then, gradually, refined, by, activity, dependent, mechanisms, partly, driven, by, internal, dynamics, partly, by, external, sensory, inputs, in, some, cases, as, with, the, retina, midbrain, system, activity, patterns, depend, on, mechanisms, that, operate, only, in, the, developing, brain, and, apparently, exist, solely, to, guide, development, in, humans, and, many, other, mammals, new, neurons, are, created, mainly, before, birth, and, the, infant, brain, contains, substantially, more, neurons, than, the, adult, brain, there, are, however, a, few, areas, where, new, neurons, continue, to, be, generated, throughout, life, the, two, areas, for, which, adult, neurogenesis, is, well, established, are, the, olfactory, bulb, which, is, involved, in, the, sense, of, smell, and, the, dentate, gyrus, of, the, hippocampus, where, there, is, evidence, that, the, new, neurons, play, a, role, in, storing, newly, acquired, memories, with, these, exceptions, however, the, set, of, neurons, that, is, present, in, early, childhood, is, the, set, that, is, present, for, life, glial, cells, are, different, as, with, most, types, of, cells, in, the, body, they, are, generated, throughout, the, lifespan, there, has, long, been, debate, about, whether, the, qualities, of, mind, personality, and, intelligence, can, be, attributed, to, heredity, or, to, upbringing, although, many, details, remain, to, be, settled, neuroscience, shows, that, both, factors, are, important, genes, determine, both, the, general, form, of, the, brain, and, how, it, reacts, to, experience, but, experience, is, required, to, refine, the, matrix, of, synaptic, connections, resulting, in, greatly, increased, complexity, the, presence, or, absence, of, experience, is, critical, at, key, periods, of, development, additionally, the, quantity, and, quality, of, experience, are, important, for, example, animals, raised, in, enriched, environments, demonstrate, thick, cerebral, cortices, indicating, a, high, density, of, synaptic, connections, compared, to, animals, with, restricted, levels, of, stimulation, the, functions, of, the, brain, depend, on, the, ability, of, neurons, to, transmit, electrochemical, signals, to, other, cells, and, their, ability, to, respond, appropriately, to, electrochemical, signals, received, from, other, cells, the, electrical, properties, of, neurons, are, controlled, by, a, wide, variety, of, biochemical, and, metabolic, processes, most, notably, the, interactions, between, neurotransmitters, and, receptors, that, take, place, at, synapses, neurotransmitters, are, chemicals, that, are, released, at, synapses, when, the, local, membrane, is, depolarised, and, ca, 2, enters, into, the, cell, typically, when, an, action, potential, arrives, at, the, synapse, neurotransmitters, attach, themselves, to, receptor, molecules, on, the, membrane, of, the, synapse, s, target, cell, or, cells, and, thereby, alter, the, electrical, or, chemical, properties, of, the, receptor, molecules, with, few, exceptions, each, neuron, in, the, brain, releases, the, same, chemical, neurotransmitter, or, combination, of, neurotransmitters, at, all, the, synaptic, connections, it, makes, with, other, neurons, this, rule, is, known, as, dale, s, principle, thus, a, neuron, can, be, characterized, by, the, neurotransmitters, that, it, releases, the, great, majority, of, psychoactive, drugs, exert, their, effects, by, altering, specific, neurotransmitter, systems, this, applies, to, drugs, such, as, cannabinoids, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and, many, others, the, two, neurotransmitters, that, are, most, widely, found, in, the, vertebrate, brain, are, glutamate, which, almost, always, exerts, excitatory, effects, on, target, neurons, and, gamma, aminobutyric, acid, gaba, which, is, almost, always, inhibitory, neurons, using, these, transmitters, can, be, found, in, nearly, every, part, of, the, brain, because, of, their, ubiquity, drugs, that, act, on, glutamate, or, gaba, tend, to, have, broad, and, powerful, effects, some, general, anesthetics, act, by, reducing, the, effects, of, glutamate, most, tranquilizers, exert, their, sedative, effects, by, enhancing, the, effects, of, gaba, there, are, dozens, of, other, chemical, neurotransmitters, that, are, used, in, more, limited, areas, of, the, brain, often, areas, dedicated, to, a, particular, function, serotonin, for, example, the, primary, target, of, many, antidepressant, drugs, and, many, dietary, aids, comes, exclusively, from, a, small, brainstem, area, called, the, raphe, nuclei, norepinephrine, which, is, involved, in, arousal, comes, exclusively, from, a, nearby, small, area, called, the, locus, coeruleus, other, neurotransmitters, such, as, acetylcholine, and, dopamine, have, multiple, sources, in, the, brain, but, are, not, as, ubiquitously, distributed, as, glutamate, and, gaba, as, a, side, effect, of, the, electrochemical, processes, used, by, neurons, for, signaling, brain, tissue, generates, electric, fields, when, it, is, active, when, large, numbers, of, neurons, show, synchronized, activity, the, electric, fields, that, they, generate, can, be, large, enough, to, detect, outside, the, skull, using, electroencephalography, eeg, or, magnetoencephalography, meg, eeg, recordings, along, with, recordings, made, from, electrodes, implanted, inside, the, brains, of, animals, such, as, rats, show, that, the, brain, of, a, living, animal, is, constantly, active, even, during, sleep, each, part, of, the, brain, shows, a, mixture, of, rhythmic, and, nonrhythmic, activity, which, may, vary, according, to, behavioral, state, in, mammals, the, cerebral, cortex, tends, to, show, large, slow, delta, waves, during, sleep, faster, alpha, waves, when, the, animal, is, awake, but, inattentive, and, chaotic, looking, irregular, activity, when, the, animal, is, actively, engaged, in, a, task, called, beta, and, gamma, waves, during, an, epileptic, seizure, the, brain, s, inhibitory, control, mechanisms, fail, to, function, and, electrical, activity, rises, to, pathological, levels, producing, eeg, traces, that, show, large, wave, and, spike, patterns, not, seen, in, a, healthy, brain, relating, these, population, level, patterns, to, the, computational, functions, of, individual, neurons, is, a, major, focus, of, current, research, in, neurophysiology, all, vertebrates, have, a, blood, brain, barrier, that, allows, metabolism, inside, the, brain, to, operate, differently, from, metabolism, in, other, parts, of, the, body, the, neurovascular, unit, regulates, cerebral, blood, flow, so, that, activated, neurons, can, be, supplied, with, energy, glial, cells, play, a, major, role, in, brain, metabolism, by, controlling, the, chemical, composition, of, the, fluid, that, surrounds, neurons, including, levels, of, ions, and, nutrients, brain, tissue, consumes, a, large, amount, of, energy, in, proportion, to, its, volume, so, large, brains, place, severe, metabolic, demands, on, animals, the, need, to, limit, body, weight, in, order, for, example, to, fly, has, apparently, led, to, selection, for, a, reduction, of, brain, size, in, some, species, such, as, bats, most, of, the, brain, s, energy, consumption, goes, into, sustaining, the, electric, charge, membrane, potential, of, neurons, most, vertebrate, species, devote, between, 2, and, 8, of, basal, metabolism, to, the, brain, in, primates, however, the, percentage, is, much, higher, in, humans, it, rises, to, 20, 25, the, energy, consumption, of, the, brain, does, not, vary, greatly, over, time, but, active, regions, of, the, cerebral, cortex, consume, somewhat, more, energy, than, inactive, regions, this, forms, the, basis, for, the, functional, brain, imaging, methods, of, pet, fmri, and, nirs, the, brain, typically, gets, most, of, its, energy, from, oxygen, dependent, metabolism, of, glucose, i, e, blood, sugar, but, ketones, provide, a, major, alternative, source, together, with, contributions, from, medium, chain, fatty, acids, caprylic, and, heptanoic, acids, lactate, acetate, and, possibly, amino, acids, information, from, the, sense, organs, is, collected, in, the, brain, there, it, is, used, to, determine, what, actions, the, organism, is, to, take, the, brain, processes, the, raw, data, to, extract, information, about, the, structure, of, the, environment, next, it, combines, the, processed, information, with, information, about, the, current, needs, of, the, animal, and, with, memory, of, past, circumstances, finally, on, the, basis, of, the, results, it, generates, motor, response, patterns, these, signal, processing, tasks, require, intricate, interplay, between, a, variety, of, functional, subsystems, the, function, of, the, brain, is, to, provide, coherent, control, over, the, actions, of, an, animal, a, centralized, brain, allows, groups, of, muscles, to, be, co, activated, in, complex, patterns, it, also, allows, stimuli, impinging, on, one, part, of, the, body, to, evoke, responses, in, other, parts, and, it, can, prevent, different, parts, of, the, body, from, acting, at, cross, purposes, to, each, other, the, human, brain, is, provided, with, information, about, light, sound, the, chemical, composition, of, the, atmosphere, temperature, the, position, of, the, body, in, space, proprioception, the, chemical, composition, of, the, bloodstream, and, more, in, other, animals, additional, senses, are, present, such, as, the, infrared, heat, sense, of, snakes, the, magnetic, field, sense, of, some, birds, or, the, electric, field, sense, mainly, seen, in, aquatic, animals, each, sensory, system, begins, with, specialized, receptor, cells, such, as, photoreceptor, cells, in, the, retina, of, the, eye, or, vibration, sensitive, hair, cells, in, the, cochlea, of, the, ear, the, axons, of, sensory, receptor, cells, travel, into, the, spinal, cord, or, brain, where, they, transmit, their, signals, to, a, first, order, sensory, nucleus, dedicated, to, one, specific, sensory, modality, this, primary, sensory, nucleus, sends, information, to, higher, order, sensory, areas, that, are, dedicated, to, the, same, modality, eventually, via, a, way, station, in, the, thalamus, the, signals, are, sent, to, the, cerebral, cortex, where, they, are, processed, to, extract, the, relevant, features, and, integrated, with, signals, coming, from, other, sensory, systems, motor, systems, are, areas, of, the, brain, that, are, involved, in, initiating, body, movements, that, is, in, activating, muscles, except, for, the, muscles, that, control, the, eye, which, are, driven, by, nuclei, in, the, midbrain, all, the, voluntary, muscles, in, the, body, are, directly, innervated, by, motor, neurons, in, the, spinal, cord, and, hindbrain, spinal, motor, neurons, are, controlled, both, by, neural, circuits, intrinsic, to, the, spinal, cord, and, by, inputs, that, descend, from, the, brain, the, intrinsic, spinal, circuits, implement, many, reflex, responses, and, contain, pattern, generators, for, rhythmic, movements, such, as, walking, or, swimming, the, descending, connections, from, the, brain, allow, for, more, sophisticated, control, the, brain, contains, several, motor, areas, that, project, directly, to, the, spinal, cord, at, the, lowest, level, are, motor, areas, in, the, medulla, and, pons, which, control, stereotyped, movements, such, as, walking, breathing, or, swallowing, at, a, higher, level, are, areas, in, the, midbrain, such, as, the, red, nucleus, which, is, responsible, for, coordinating, movements, of, the, arms, and, legs, at, a, higher, level, yet, is, the, primary, motor, cortex, a, strip, of, tissue, located, at, the, posterior, edge, of, the, frontal, lobe, the, primary, motor, cortex, sends, projections, to, the, subcortical, motor, areas, but, also, sends, a, massive, projection, directly, to, the, spinal, cord, through, the, pyramidal, tract, this, direct, corticospinal, projection, allows, for, precise, voluntary, control, of, the, fine, details, of, movements, other, motor, related, brain, areas, exert, secondary, effects, by, projecting, to, the, primary, motor, areas, among, the, most, important, secondary, areas, are, the, premotor, cortex, supplementary, motor, area, basal, ganglia, and, cerebellum, in, addition, to, all, of, the, above, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, contain, extensive, circuitry, to, control, the, autonomic, nervous, system, which, controls, the, movement, of, the, smooth, muscle, of, the, body, many, animals, alternate, between, sleeping, and, waking, in, a, daily, cycle, arousal, and, alertness, are, also, modulated, on, a, finer, time, scale, by, a, network, of, brain, areas, a, key, component, of, the, sleep, system, is, the, suprachiasmatic, nucleus, scn, a, tiny, part, of, the, hypothalamus, located, directly, above, the, point, at, which, the, optic, nerves, from, the, two, eyes, cross, the, scn, contains, the, body, s, central, biological, clock, neurons, there, show, activity, levels, that, rise, and, fall, with, a, period, of, about, 24, hours, circadian, rhythms, these, activity, fluctuations, are, driven, by, rhythmic, changes, in, expression, of, a, set, of, clock, genes, the, scn, continues, to, keep, time, even, if, it, is, excised, from, the, brain, and, placed, in, a, dish, of, warm, nutrient, solution, but, it, ordinarily, receives, input, from, the, optic, nerves, through, the, retinohypothalamic, tract, rht, that, allows, daily, light, dark, cycles, to, calibrate, the, clock, the, scn, projects, to, a, set, of, areas, in, the, hypothalamus, brainstem, and, midbrain, that, are, involved, in, implementing, sleep, wake, cycles, an, important, component, of, the, system, is, the, reticular, formation, a, group, of, neuron, clusters, scattered, diffusely, through, the, core, of, the, lower, brain, reticular, neurons, send, signals, to, the, thalamus, which, in, turn, sends, activity, level, controlling, signals, to, every, part, of, the, cortex, damage, to, the, reticular, formation, can, produce, a, permanent, state, of, coma, sleep, involves, great, changes, in, brain, activity, until, the, 1950s, it, was, generally, believed, that, the, brain, essentially, shuts, off, during, sleep, but, this, is, now, known, to, be, far, from, true, activity, continues, but, patterns, become, very, different, there, are, two, types, of, sleep, rem, sleep, with, dreaming, and, nrem, non, rem, usually, without, dreaming, sleep, which, repeat, in, slightly, varying, patterns, throughout, a, sleep, episode, three, broad, types, of, distinct, brain, activity, patterns, can, be, measured, rem, light, nrem, and, deep, nrem, during, deep, nrem, sleep, also, called, slow, wave, sleep, activity, in, the, cortex, takes, the, form, of, large, synchronized, waves, whereas, in, the, waking, state, it, is, noisy, and, desynchronized, levels, of, the, neurotransmitters, norepinephrine, and, serotonin, drop, during, slow, wave, sleep, and, fall, almost, to, zero, during, rem, sleep, levels, of, acetylcholine, show, the, reverse, pattern, for, any, animal, survival, requires, maintaining, a, variety, of, parameters, of, bodily, state, within, a, limited, range, of, variation, these, include, temperature, water, content, salt, concentration, in, the, bloodstream, blood, glucose, levels, blood, oxygen, level, and, others, the, ability, of, an, animal, to, regulate, the, internal, environment, of, its, body, the, milieu, int, rieur, as, the, pioneering, physiologist, claude, bernard, called, it, is, known, as, homeostasis, greek, for, standing, still, maintaining, homeostasis, is, a, crucial, function, of, the, brain, the, basic, principle, that, underlies, homeostasis, is, negative, feedback, any, time, a, parameter, diverges, from, its, set, point, sensors, generate, an, error, signal, that, evokes, a, response, that, causes, the, parameter, to, shift, back, toward, its, optimum, value, this, principle, is, widely, used, in, engineering, for, example, in, the, control, of, temperature, using, a, thermostat, in, vertebrates, the, part, of, the, brain, that, plays, the, greatest, role, is, the, hypothalamus, a, small, region, at, the, base, of, the, forebrain, whose, size, does, not, reflect, its, complexity, or, the, importance, of, its, function, the, hypothalamus, is, a, collection, of, small, nuclei, most, of, which, are, involved, in, basic, biological, functions, some, of, these, functions, relate, to, arousal, or, to, social, interactions, such, as, sexuality, aggression, or, maternal, behaviors, but, many, of, them, relate, to, homeostasis, several, hypothalamic, nuclei, receive, input, from, sensors, located, in, the, lining, of, blood, vessels, conveying, information, about, temperature, sodium, level, glucose, level, blood, oxygen, level, and, other, parameters, these, hypothalamic, nuclei, send, output, signals, to, motor, areas, that, can, generate, actions, to, rectify, deficiencies, some, of, the, outputs, also, go, to, the, pituitary, gland, a, tiny, gland, attached, to, the, brain, directly, underneath, the, hypothalamus, the, pituitary, gland, secretes, hormones, into, the, bloodstream, where, they, circulate, throughout, the, body, and, induce, changes, in, cellular, activity, the, individual, animals, need, to, express, survival, promoting, behaviors, such, as, seeking, food, water, shelter, and, a, mate, the, motivational, system, in, the, brain, monitors, the, current, state, of, satisfaction, of, these, goals, and, activates, behaviors, to, meet, any, needs, that, arise, the, motivational, system, works, largely, by, a, reward, punishment, mechanism, when, a, particular, behavior, is, followed, by, favorable, consequences, the, reward, mechanism, in, the, brain, is, activated, which, induces, structural, changes, inside, the, brain, that, cause, the, same, behavior, to, be, repeated, later, whenever, a, similar, situation, arises, conversely, when, a, behavior, is, followed, by, unfavorable, consequences, the, brain, s, punishment, mechanism, is, activated, inducing, structural, changes, that, cause, the, behavior, to, be, suppressed, when, similar, situations, arise, in, the, future, most, organisms, studied, to, date, use, a, reward, punishment, mechanism, for, instance, worms, and, insects, can, alter, their, behavior, to, seek, food, sources, or, to, avoid, dangers, in, vertebrates, the, reward, punishment, system, is, implemented, by, a, specific, set, of, brain, structures, at, the, heart, of, which, lie, the, basal, ganglia, a, set, of, interconnected, areas, at, the, base, of, the, forebrain, the, basal, ganglia, are, the, central, site, at, which, decisions, are, made, the, basal, ganglia, exert, a, sustained, inhibitory, control, over, most, of, the, motor, systems, in, the, brain, when, this, inhibition, is, released, a, motor, system, is, permitted, to, execute, the, action, it, is, programmed, to, carry, out, rewards, and, punishments, function, by, altering, the, relationship, between, the, inputs, that, the, basal, ganglia, receive, and, the, decision, signals, that, are, emitted, the, reward, mechanism, is, better, understood, than, the, punishment, mechanism, because, its, role, in, drug, abuse, has, caused, it, to, be, studied, very, intensively, research, has, shown, that, the, neurotransmitter, dopamine, plays, a, central, role, addictive, drugs, such, as, cocaine, amphetamine, and, nicotine, either, cause, dopamine, levels, to, rise, or, cause, the, effects, of, dopamine, inside, the, brain, to, be, enhanced, almost, all, animals, are, capable, of, modifying, their, behavior, as, a, result, of, experience, even, the, most, primitive, types, of, worms, because, behavior, is, driven, by, brain, activity, changes, in, behavior, must, somehow, correspond, to, changes, inside, the, brain, already, in, the, late, 19th, century, theorists, like, santiago, ram, n, y, cajal, argued, that, the, most, plausible, explanation, is, that, learning, and, memory, are, expressed, as, changes, in, the, synaptic, connections, between, neurons, until, 1970, however, experimental, evidence, to, support, the, synaptic, plasticity, hypothesis, was, lacking, in, 1971, tim, bliss, and, terje, l, mo, published, a, paper, on, a, phenomenon, now, called, long, term, potentiation, the, paper, showed, clear, evidence, of, activity, induced, synaptic, changes, that, lasted, for, at, least, several, days, since, then, technical, advances, have, made, these, sorts, of, experiments, much, easier, to, carry, out, and, thousands, of, studies, have, been, made, that, have, clarified, the, mechanism, of, synaptic, change, and, uncovered, other, types, of, activity, driven, synaptic, change, in, a, variety, of, brain, areas, including, the, cerebral, cortex, hippocampus, basal, ganglia, and, cerebellum, brain, derived, neurotrophic, factor, bdnf, and, physical, activity, appear, to, play, a, beneficial, role, in, the, process, neuroscientists, currently, distinguish, several, types, of, learning, and, memory, that, are, implemented, by, the, brain, in, distinct, ways, the, field, of, neuroscience, encompasses, all, approaches, that, seek, to, understand, the, brain, and, the, rest, of, the, nervous, system, psychology, seeks, to, understand, mind, and, behavior, and, neurology, is, the, medical, discipline, that, diagnoses, and, treats, diseases, of, the, nervous, system, the, brain, is, also, the, most, important, organ, studied, in, psychiatry, the, branch, of, medicine, that, works, to, study, prevent, and, treat, mental, disorders, cognitive, science, seeks, to, unify, neuroscience, and, psychology, with, other, fields, that, concern, themselves, with, the, brain, such, as, computer, science, artificial, intelligence, and, similar, fields, and, philosophy, the, oldest, method, of, studying, the, brain, is, anatomical, and, until, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, much, of, the, progress, in, neuroscience, came, from, the, development, of, better, cell, stains, and, better, microscopes, neuroanatomists, study, the, large, scale, structure, of, the, brain, as, well, as, the, microscopic, structure, of, neurons, and, their, components, especially, synapses, among, other, tools, they, employ, a, plethora, of, stains, that, reveal, neural, structure, chemistry, and, connectivity, in, recent, years, the, development, of, immunostaining, techniques, has, allowed, investigation, of, neurons, that, express, specific, sets, of, genes, also, functional, neuroanatomy, uses, medical, imaging, techniques, to, correlate, variations, in, human, brain, structure, with, differences, in, cognition, or, behavior, neurophysiologists, study, the, chemical, pharmacological, and, electrical, properties, of, the, brain, their, primary, tools, are, drugs, and, recording, devices, thousands, of, experimentally, developed, drugs, affect, the, nervous, system, some, in, highly, specific, ways, recordings, of, brain, activity, can, be, made, using, electrodes, either, glued, to, the, scalp, as, in, eeg, studies, or, implanted, inside, the, brains, of, animals, for, extracellular, recordings, which, can, detect, action, potentials, generated, by, individual, neurons, because, the, brain, does, not, contain, pain, receptors, it, is, possible, using, these, techniques, to, record, brain, activity, from, animals, that, are, awake, and, behaving, without, causing, distress, the, same, techniques, have, occasionally, been, used, to, study, brain, activity, in, human, patients, with, intractable, epilepsy, in, cases, where, there, was, a, medical, necessity, to, implant, electrodes, to, localize, the, brain, area, responsible, for, epileptic, seizures, functional, imaging, techniques, such, as, fmri, are, also, used, to, study, brain, activity, these, techniques, have, mainly, been, used, with, human, subjects, because, they, require, a, conscious, subject, to, remain, motionless, for, long, periods, of, time, but, they, have, the, great, advantage, of, being, noninvasive, another, approach, to, brain, function, is, to, examine, the, consequences, of, damage, to, specific, brain, areas, even, though, it, is, protected, by, the, skull, and, meninges, surrounded, by, cerebrospinal, fluid, and, isolated, from, the, bloodstream, by, the, blood, brain, barrier, the, delicate, nature, of, the, brain, makes, it, vulnerable, to, numerous, diseases, and, several, types, of, damage, in, humans, the, effects, of, strokes, and, other, types, of, brain, damage, have, been, a, key, source, of, information, about, brain, function, because, there, is, no, ability, to, experimentally, control, the, nature, of, the, damage, however, this, information, is, often, difficult, to, interpret, in, animal, studies, most, commonly, involving, rats, it, is, possible, to, use, electrodes, or, locally, injected, chemicals, to, produce, precise, patterns, of, damage, and, then, examine, the, consequences, for, behavior, computational, neuroscience, encompasses, two, approaches, first, the, use, of, computers, to, study, the, brain, second, the, study, of, how, brains, perform, computation, on, one, hand, it, is, possible, to, write, a, computer, program, to, simulate, the, operation, of, a, group, of, neurons, by, making, use, of, systems, of, equations, that, describe, their, electrochemical, activity, such, simulations, are, known, as, biologically, realistic, neural, networks, on, the, other, hand, it, is, possible, to, study, algorithms, for, neural, computation, by, simulating, or, mathematically, analyzing, the, operations, of, simplified, units, that, have, some, of, the, properties, of, neurons, but, abstract, out, much, of, their, biological, complexity, the, computational, functions, of, the, brain, are, studied, both, by, computer, scientists, and, neuroscientists, computational, neurogenetic, modeling, is, concerned, with, the, study, and, development, of, dynamic, neuronal, models, for, modeling, brain, functions, with, respect, to, genes, and, dynamic, interactions, between, genes, recent, years, have, seen, increasing, applications, of, genetic, and, genomic, techniques, to, the, study, of, the, brain, and, a, focus, on, the, roles, of, neurotrophic, factors, and, physical, activity, in, neuroplasticity, the, most, common, subjects, are, mice, because, of, the, availability, of, technical, tools, it, is, now, possible, with, relative, ease, to, knock, out, or, mutate, a, wide, variety, of, genes, and, then, examine, the, effects, on, brain, function, more, sophisticated, approaches, are, also, being, used, for, example, using, cre, lox, recombination, it, is, possible, to, activate, or, deactivate, genes, in, specific, parts, of, the, brain, at, specific, times, recent, years, have, also, seen, rapid, advances, in, single, cell, sequencing, technologies, and, these, have, been, used, to, leverage, the, cellular, heterogeneity, of, the, brain, as, a, means, of, better, understanding, the, roles, of, distinct, cell, types, in, disease, and, biology, as, well, as, how, genomic, variants, influence, individual, cell, types, in, 2024, investigators, studied, a, large, integrated, dataset, of, almost, 3, million, nuclei, from, the, human, prefrontal, cortext, from, 388, individuals, in, doing, so, they, annotated, 28, cell, types, to, evaluate, expression, and, chromatin, variation, across, gene, families, and, drug, targets, they, identified, about, half, a, million, cell, type, specific, regulatory, elements, and, about, 1, 5, million, single, cell, expression, quantitative, trait, loci, ie, genomic, variants, with, strong, statistical, associations, with, changes, in, gene, expression, within, specific, cell, types, which, were, then, used, to, build, cell, type, regulatory, networks, the, study, also, describes, cell, to, cell, communication, networks, these, networks, were, found, to, manifest, cellular, changes, in, aging, and, neuropsychiatric, disorders, as, part, of, the, same, investigation, a, machine, learning, model, was, designed, to, accurately, impute, single, cell, expression, this, model, prioritized, 250, disease, risk, genes, and, drug, targets, with, associated, cell, types, the, oldest, brain, to, have, been, discovered, was, in, armenia, in, the, areni, 1, cave, complex, the, brain, estimated, to, be, over, 5, 000, years, old, was, found, in, the, skull, of, a, 12, to, 14, year, old, girl, although, the, brains, were, shriveled, they, were, well, preserved, due, to, the, climate, found, inside, the, cave, early, philosophers, were, divided, as, to, whether, the, seat, of, the, soul, lies, in, the, brain, or, heart, aristotle, favored, the, heart, and, thought, that, the, function, of, the, brain, was, merely, to, cool, the, blood, democritus, the, inventor, of, the, atomic, theory, of, matter, argued, for, a, three, part, soul, with, intellect, in, the, head, emotion, in, the, heart, and, lust, near, the, liver, the, unknown, author, of, on, the, sacred, disease, a, medical, treatise, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, came, down, unequivocally, in, favor, of, the, brain, writing, men, ought, to, know, that, from, nothing, else, but, the, brain, come, joys, delights, laughter, and, sports, and, sorrows, griefs, despondency, and, lamentations, and, by, the, same, organ, we, become, mad, and, delirious, and, fears, and, terrors, assail, us, some, by, night, and, some, by, day, and, dreams, and, untimely, wanderings, and, cares, that, are, not, suitable, and, ignorance, of, present, circumstances, desuetude, and, unskillfulness, all, these, things, we, endure, from, the, brain, when, it, is, not, healthy, the, roman, physician, galen, also, argued, for, the, importance, of, the, brain, and, theorized, in, some, depth, about, how, it, might, work, galen, traced, out, the, anatomical, relationships, among, brain, nerves, and, muscles, demonstrating, that, all, muscles, in, the, body, are, connected, to, the, brain, through, a, branching, network, of, nerves, he, postulated, that, nerves, activate, muscles, mechanically, by, carrying, a, mysterious, substance, he, called, pneumata, psychikon, usually, translated, as, animal, spirits, galen, s, ideas, were, widely, known, during, the, middle, ages, but, not, much, further, progress, came, until, the, renaissance, when, detailed, anatomical, study, resumed, combined, with, the, theoretical, speculations, of, ren, descartes, and, those, who, followed, him, descartes, like, galen, thought, of, the, nervous, system, in, hydraulic, terms, he, believed, that, the, highest, cognitive, functions, are, carried, out, by, a, non, physical, res, cogitans, but, that, the, majority, of, behaviors, of, humans, and, all, behaviors, of, animals, could, be, explained, mechanistically, the, first, real, progress, toward, a, modern, understanding, of, nervous, function, though, came, from, the, investigations, of, luigi, galvani, 1737, 1798, who, discovered, that, a, shock, of, static, electricity, applied, to, an, exposed, nerve, of, a, dead, frog, could, cause, its, leg, to, contract, since, that, time, each, major, advance, in, understanding, has, followed, more, or, less, directly, from, the, development, of, a, new, technique, of, investigation, until, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, the, most, important, advances, were, derived, from, new, methods, for, staining, cells, particularly, critical, was, the, invention, of, the, golgi, stain, which, when, correctly, used, stains, only, a, small, fraction, of, neurons, but, stains, them, in, their, entirety, including, cell, body, dendrites, and, axon, without, such, a, stain, brain, tissue, under, a, microscope, appears, as, an, impenetrable, tangle, of, protoplasmic, fibers, in, which, it, is, impossible, to, determine, any, structure, in, the, hands, of, camillo, golgi, and, especially, of, the, spanish, neuroanatomist, santiago, ram, n, y, cajal, the, new, stain, revealed, hundreds, of, distinct, types, of, neurons, each, with, its, own, unique, dendritic, structure, and, pattern, of, connectivity, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, advances, in, electronics, enabled, investigation, of, the, electrical, properties, of, nerve, cells, culminating, in, work, by, alan, hodgkin, andrew, huxley, and, others, on, the, biophysics, of, the, action, potential, and, the, work, of, bernard, katz, and, others, on, the, electrochemistry, of, the, synapse, these, studies, complemented, the, anatomical, picture, with, a, conception, of, the, brain, as, a, dynamic, entity, reflecting, the, new, understanding, in, 1942, charles, sherrington, visualized, the, workings, of, the, brain, waking, from, sleep, the, great, topmost, sheet, of, the, mass, that, where, hardly, a, light, had, twinkled, or, moved, becomes, now, a, sparkling, field, of, rhythmic, flashing, points, with, trains, of, traveling, sparks, hurrying, hither, and, thither, the, brain, is, waking, and, with, it, the, mind, is, returning, it, is, as, if, the, milky, way, entered, upon, some, cosmic, dance, swiftly, the, head, mass, becomes, an, enchanted, loom, where, millions, of, flashing, shuttles, weave, a, dissolving, pattern, always, a, meaningful, pattern, though, never, an, abiding, one, a, shifting, harmony, of, subpatterns, the, invention, of, electronic, computers, in, the, 1940s, along, with, the, development, of, mathematical, information, theory, led, to, a, realization, that, brains, can, potentially, be, understood, as, information, processing, systems, this, concept, formed, the, basis, of, the, field, of, cybernetics, and, eventually, gave, rise, to, the, field, now, known, as, computational, neuroscience, the, earliest, attempts, at, cybernetics, were, somewhat, crude, in, that, they, treated, the, brain, as, essentially, a, digital, computer, in, disguise, as, for, example, in, john, von, neumann, s, 1958, book, the, computer, and, the, brain, over, the, years, though, accumulating, information, about, the, electrical, responses, of, brain, cells, recorded, from, behaving, animals, has, steadily, moved, theoretical, concepts, in, the, direction, of, increasing, realism, one, of, the, most, influential, early, contributions, was, a, 1959, paper, titled, what, the, frog, s, eye, tells, the, frog, s, brain, the, paper, examined, the, visual, responses, of, neurons, in, the, retina, and, optic, tectum, of, frogs, and, came, to, the, conclusion, that, some, neurons, in, the, tectum, of, the, frog, are, wired, to, combine, elementary, responses, in, a, way, that, makes, them, function, as, bug, perceivers, a, few, years, later, david, hubel, and, torsten, wiesel, discovered, cells, in, the, primary, visual, cortex, of, monkeys, that, become, active, when, sharp, edges, move, across, specific, points, in, the, field, of, view, a, discovery, for, which, they, won, a, nobel, prize, follow, up, studies, in, higher, order, visual, areas, found, cells, that, detect, binocular, disparity, color, movement, and, aspects, of, shape, with, areas, located, at, increasing, distances, from, the, primary, visual, cortex, showing, increasingly, complex, responses, other, investigations, of, brain, areas, unrelated, to, vision, have, revealed, cells, with, a, wide, variety, of, response, correlates, some, related, to, memory, some, to, abstract, types, of, cognition, such, as, space, theorists, have, worked, to, understand, these, response, patterns, by, constructing, mathematical, models, of, neurons, and, neural, networks, which, can, be, simulated, using, computers, some, useful, models, are, abstract, focusing, on, the, conceptual, structure, of, neural, algorithms, rather, than, the, details, of, how, they, are, implemented, in, the, brain, other, models, attempt, to, incorporate, data, about, the, biophysical, properties, of, real, neurons, no, model, on, any, level, is, yet, considered, to, be, a, fully, valid, description, of, brain, function, though, the, essential, difficulty, is, that, sophisticated, computation, by, neural, networks, requires, distributed, processing, in, which, hundreds, or, thousands, of, neurons, work, cooperatively, current, methods, of, brain, activity, recording, are, only, capable, of, isolating, action, potentials, from, a, few, dozen, neurons, at, a, time, furthermore, even, single, neurons, appear, to, be, complex, and, capable, of, performing, computations, so, brain, models, that, do, not, reflect, this, are, too, abstract, to, be, representative, of, brain, operation, models, that, do, try, to, capture, this, are, very, computationally, expensive, and, arguably, intractable, with, present, computational, resources, however, the, human, brain, project, is, trying, to, build, a, realistic, detailed, computational, model, of, the, entire, human, brain, the, wisdom, of, this, approach, has, been, publicly, contested, with, high, profile, scientists, on, both, sides, of, the, argument, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, developments, in, chemistry, electron, microscopy, genetics, computer, science, functional, brain, imaging, and, other, fields, progressively, opened, new, windows, into, brain, structure, and, function, in, the, united, states, the, 1990s, were, officially, designated, as, the, decade, of, the, brain, to, commemorate, advances, made, in, brain, research, and, to, promote, funding, for, such, research, in, the, 21st, century, these, trends, have, continued, and, several, new, approaches, have, come, into, prominence, including, multielectrode, recording, which, allows, the, activity, of, many, brain, cells, to, be, recorded, all, at, the, same, time, genetic, engineering, which, allows, molecular, components, of, the, brain, to, be, altered, experimentally, genomics, which, allows, variations, in, brain, structure, to, be, correlated, with, variations, in, dna, properties, and, neuroimaging, animal, brains, are, used, as, food, in, numerous, cuisines, some, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, the, mourning, rituals, of, european, neanderthals, also, involved, the, consumption, of, the, brain, the, fore, people, of, papua, new, guinea, are, known, to, eat, human, brains, in, funerary, rituals, those, close, to, the, dead, would, eat, the, brain, of, the, deceased, to, create, a, sense, of, immortality, a, prion, disease, called, kuru, has, been, traced, to, this
