the, chickpea, or, chick, pea, cicer, arietinum, is, an, annual, legume, of, the, family, fabaceae, subfamily, faboideae, its, different, types, are, variously, known, as, gram, or, bengal, gram, chhola, chhana, chana, or, channa, garbanzo, or, garbanzo, bean, or, egyptian, pea, chickpea, seeds, are, high, in, protein, it, is, one, of, the, earliest, cultivated, legumes, the, oldest, archaeological, evidence, of, which, was, found, in, syria, the, chickpea, is, a, key, ingredient, in, mediterranean, and, middle, eastern, cuisines, used, in, hummus, and, when, soaked, and, coarsely, ground, with, herbs, and, spices, then, made, into, patties, and, fried, falafel, as, an, important, part, of, indian, cuisine, it, is, used, in, salads, soups, and, stews, and, curry, in, chana, masala, and, in, other, food, products, that, contain, channa, chickpeas, in, 2022, india, accounted, for, 75, of, global, chickpea, production, the, name, chickpea, earlier, chiche, pease, is, modelled, on, middle, french, pois, chiche, where, chiche, comes, from, latin, cicer, chich, was, used, by, itself, in, english, from, the, 14th, to, the, 18th, centuries, the, word, garbanzo, from, an, alteration, of, old, spanish, arvan, o, came, first, to, english, as, garvance, in, the, 17th, century, being, gradually, anglicized, to, calavance, though, that, came, to, refer, to, a, variety, of, other, beans, including, the, hyacinth, bean, the, current, form, garbanzo, comes, directly, from, modern, spanish, the, earliest, well, preserved, archaeobotanical, evidence, of, chickpea, outside, its, wild, progenitor, s, natural, distribution, area, comes, from, the, site, of, tell, el, kerkh, in, modern, syria, dating, back, to, the, early, pre, pottery, neolithic, period, around, c, 8400, bc, cicer, reticulatum, is, the, wild, progenitor, of, chickpeas, this, species, currently, grows, only, in, southeast, turkey, where, it, is, believed, to, have, been, domesticated, the, domestication, event, can, be, dated, to, around, 7000, bc, domesticated, chickpeas, have, been, found, at, pre, pottery, neolithic, b, sites, in, turkey, and, the, levant, namely, at, ay, n, hacilar, and, tell, es, sultan, jericho, chickpeas, then, spread, to, the, mediterranean, region, around, 6000, bc, and, india, around, 3000, bc, in, southern, france, mesolithic, layers, in, a, cave, at, l, abeurador, h, rault, have, yielded, chickpeas, carbon, dated, to, 6790, 90, bc, they, were, found, in, the, late, neolithic, about, 3500, bc, sites, at, thessaly, kastanas, lerna, and, dimini, greece, chickpeas, are, mentioned, in, charlemagne, s, capitulare, de, villis, about, 800, ad, as, cicer, italicum, as, grown, in, each, imperial, demesne, albertus, magnus, mentions, red, white, and, black, varieties, the, 17th, century, botanist, nicholas, culpeper, noted, chick, pease, or, cicers, are, less, windy, than, peas, and, more, nourishing, ancient, people, also, associated, chickpeas, with, venus, because, they, were, said, to, offer, medical, uses, such, as, increasing, semen, and, milk, production, inducing, menstruation, and, urination, and, helping, to, treat, kidney, stones, white, cicers, were, thought, to, be, especially, strong, and, helpful, in, 1793, ground, roasted, chickpeas, were, noted, by, a, german, writer, as, a, substitute, for, coffee, in, europe, in, the, first, world, war, they, were, grown, for, this, use, in, some, areas, of, germany, they, are, still, sometimes, brewed, instead, of, coffee, sequencing, of, the, genome, of, the, chickpea, has, been, completed, for, 90, chickpea, genotypes, including, several, wild, species, a, collaboration, of, 20, research, organizations, led, by, the, international, crops, research, institute, for, the, semi, arid, tropics, icrisat, sequenced, cdc, frontier, a, kabuli, chickpea, variety, and, identified, more, than, 28, 000, genes, and, several, million, genetic, markers, the, plant, grows, to, 20, 50, cm, 8, 20, in, high, and, has, small, feathery, leaves, on, either, side, of, the, stem, chickpeas, are, a, type, of, pulse, with, one, seedpod, containing, two, or, three, peas, it, has, white, flowers, with, blue, violet, or, pink, veins, the, most, common, variety, of, chickpea, in, south, asia, ethiopia, mexico, and, iran, is, the, desi, type, also, called, bengal, gram, it, has, small, dark, seeds, and, a, rough, coat, it, can, be, black, green, or, speckled, in, hindi, it, is, called, desi, chana, native, chickpea, or, kala, chana, black, chickpea, and, in, assamese, it, is, called, boot, or, chholaa, boot, it, can, be, hulled, and, split, to, make, chana, dal, kurukshetra, prasadam, channa, laddu, and, bootor, daali, around, the, mediterranean, and, in, the, middle, east, the, most, common, variety, of, chickpea, is, the, kabuli, type, it, is, large, and, tan, colored, with, a, smooth, coat, it, was, introduced, to, india, in, the, 18th, century, from, afghanistan, and, is, called, kabuli, chana, in, hindi, an, uncommon, black, chickpea, ceci, neri, is, grown, only, in, apulia, and, basilicata, in, southern, italy, it, is, around, the, same, size, as, garbanzo, beans, larger, and, darker, than, the, desi, variety, chickpeas, are, usually, rapidly, boiled, for, 10, minutes, and, then, simmered, for, longer, dried, chickpeas, need, a, long, cooking, time, 1, 2, hours, but, will, easily, fall, apart, when, cooked, longer, if, soaked, for, 12, 24, hours, before, use, cooking, time, can, be, shortened, by, around, 30, minutes, chickpeas, can, also, be, pressure, cooked, or, sous, vide, cooked, at, 90, c, 194, f, mature, chickpeas, can, be, cooked, and, eaten, cold, in, salads, cooked, in, stews, ground, into, flour, ground, and, shaped, in, balls, and, fried, as, falafel, made, into, a, batter, and, baked, to, make, farinata, or, socca, or, fried, to, make, panelle, chickpea, flour, is, known, as, gram, flour, or, besan, in, south, asia, and, is, used, frequently, in, south, asian, cuisine, in, portugal, chickpeas, are, one, of, the, main, ingredients, in, rancho, eaten, with, pasta, meat, or, rice, they, are, used, in, other, hot, dishes, with, bacalhau, and, in, soups, meat, stews, salads, mixed, with, tuna, and, vegetables, olive, oil, vinegar, hot, pepper, and, salt, in, spain, they, are, used, cold, in, tapas, and, salads, as, well, as, in, cocido, madrile, o, hummus, is, the, arabic, word, for, chickpeas, which, are, often, cooked, and, ground, into, a, paste, and, mixed, with, tahini, sesame, seed, paste, to, make, ummu, bi, a, na, usually, called, simply, hummus, in, english, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, hummus, had, become, common, in, american, cuisine, by, 2010, 5, of, americans, consumed, it, regularly, and, it, was, present, at, some, point, in, 17, of, american, households, in, the, middle, east, chickpeas, are, also, roasted, spiced, and, eaten, as, a, snack, such, as, leblebi, chickpeas, and, bengal, grams, are, used, to, make, curries, they, are, one, of, the, most, popular, vegetarian, foods, in, the, indian, subcontinent, and, in, diaspora, communities, of, many, other, countries, served, with, a, variety, of, bread, or, steamed, rice, popular, dishes, in, indian, cuisine, are, made, with, chickpea, flour, such, as, mirchi, bajji, and, mirapakaya, bajji, in, india, as, well, as, in, the, levant, unripe, chickpeas, are, often, picked, out, of, the, pod, and, eaten, as, a, raw, snack, and, the, leaves, are, eaten, as, a, leaf, vegetable, in, salads, in, india, desserts, such, as, besan, halwa, and, sweets, such, as, mysore, pak, and, laddu, are, made, chickpea, flour, is, used, to, make, burmese, tofu, which, was, first, known, among, the, shan, people, of, burma, in, south, asian, cuisine, chickpea, flour, besan, is, used, as, a, batter, to, coat, vegetables, before, deep, frying, to, make, pakoras, the, flour, is, also, used, as, a, batter, to, coat, vegetables, and, meats, before, frying, or, fried, alone, such, as, panelle, little, bread, a, chickpea, fritter, from, sicily, chickpea, flour, is, used, to, make, the, mediterranean, flatbread, socca, and, is, called, panisse, in, provence, southern, france, it, is, made, of, cooked, chickpea, flour, poured, into, saucers, allowed, to, set, cut, into, strips, and, fried, in, olive, oil, often, eaten, during, lent, in, tuscany, chickpea, flour, farina, di, ceci, is, used, to, make, an, oven, baked, pancake, the, flour, is, mixed, with, water, oil, and, salt, chickpea, flour, known, as, kadlehittu, in, kannada, is, used, for, making, sweet, dish, mysore, pak, in, the, philippines, chickpeas, preserved, in, syrup, are, eaten, as, sweets, and, in, desserts, such, as, halo, halo, ashkenazi, jews, traditionally, serve, whole, chickpeas, referred, to, as, arbes, in, yiddish, at, the, shalom, zachar, celebration, for, baby, boys, the, chickpeas, are, boiled, until, soft, and, served, hot, with, salt, and, lots, of, ground, black, pepper, guasanas, or, garbanza, is, a, mexican, chickpea, street, snack, the, beans, while, still, green, are, cooked, in, water, and, salt, kept, in, a, steamer, to, maintain, their, humidity, and, served, in, a, plastic, bag, a, chickpea, derived, liquid, aquafaba, can, be, used, as, an, egg, white, replacement, to, make, meringue, or, ice, cream, with, the, residual, pomace, used, as, flour, chickpeas, are, an, energy, and, protein, source, as, animal, feed, raw, chickpeas, have, a, lower, trypsin, and, chymotrypsin, inhibitor, content, than, peas, common, beans, and, soybeans, this, leads, to, higher, nutrition, values, and, fewer, digestive, problems, in, non, ruminants, nonruminant, diets, can, be, completed, with, 200, g, kg, of, raw, chickpeas, to, promote, egg, production, and, growth, of, birds, and, pigs, higher, amounts, can, be, used, when, chickpeas, are, treated, with, heat, experiments, have, shown, that, ruminants, grow, equally, well, and, produce, an, equal, amount, and, quality, of, milk, when, soybean, or, cereal, meals, are, replaced, with, chickpeas, pigs, show, the, same, performance, but, growing, pigs, experience, a, negative, effect, of, raw, chickpea, feed, extruded, chickpeas, can, increase, performance, even, in, growing, pigs, only, young, broilers, starting, period, showed, worse, performance, in, poultry, diet, experiments, with, untreated, chickpeas, fish, performed, equally, well, when, extruded, chickpeas, replaced, their, soybean, or, cereal, diet, chickpea, seeds, have, also, been, used, in, rabbit, diets, secondary, components, of, legumes, such, as, lecithin, polyphenols, oligosaccharides, and, amylase, protease, trypsin, and, chymotrypsin, inhibitors, can, lead, to, lower, nutrient, availability, and, thus, to, impaired, growth, and, health, of, animals, especially, in, nonruminants, ruminants, generally, have, less, trouble, digesting, legumes, with, secondary, components, since, they, can, inactivate, them, in, the, rumen, liquor, their, diets, can, be, supplemented, by, 300, g, kg, or, more, raw, chickpea, seeds, however, protein, digestibility, and, energy, availability, can, be, improved, through, treatments, such, as, germination, dehulling, and, heat, extrusion, is, a, very, good, heat, technique, to, destroy, secondary, legume, components, since, the, proteins, are, irreversibly, denatured, overprocessing, may, decrease, the, nutritional, value, extrusion, leads, to, losses, in, minerals, and, vitamins, while, dry, heating, does, not, change, the, chemical, composition, in, 2022, world, production, of, chickpeas, was, 18, million, tonnes, led, by, india, with, 75, of, the, global, total, table, chickpeas, are, a, nutrient, dense, food, providing, rich, content, 20, or, higher, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, protein, dietary, fiber, folate, and, certain, dietary, minerals, such, as, iron, and, phosphorus, in, a, 100, gram, reference, amount, see, adjacent, nutrition, table, thiamin, vitamin, b, 6, magnesium, and, zinc, contents, are, moderate, providing, 10, 16, of, the, dv, compared, to, reference, levels, established, by, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, and, world, health, organization, proteins, in, cooked, and, germinated, chickpeas, are, rich, in, essential, amino, acids, such, as, lysine, isoleucine, tryptophan, and, total, aromatic, amino, acids, a, 100, gram, 3, 1, 2, ounce, reference, serving, of, cooked, chickpeas, provides, 686, kilojoules, 164, kilocalories, of, food, energy, cooked, chickpeas, are, 60, water, 27, carbohydrates, 9, protein, and, 3, fat, table, seventy, five, percent, of, the, fat, content, is, unsaturated, fatty, acids, for, which, linoleic, acid, comprises, 43, of, the, total, fat, cooking, treatments, do, not, lead, to, variance, in, total, protein, and, carbohydrate, content, soaking, and, cooking, of, dry, seeds, possibly, induces, chemical, modification, of, protein, fibre, complexes, which, leads, to, an, increase, in, crude, fibre, content, thus, cooking, can, increase, protein, quality, by, inactivating, or, destroying, heat, labile, antinutritional, factors, cooking, also, increases, protein, digestibility, essential, amino, acid, index, and, protein, efficiency, ratio, although, cooking, lowers, concentrations, of, amino, acids, such, as, tryptophan, lysine, total, aromatic, and, sulphur, containing, amino, acids, their, contents, are, still, higher, than, proposed, by, the, fao, who, reference, raffinose, and, sucrose, and, other, reducing, sugars, diffuse, from, the, chickpea, into, the, cooking, water, and, this, reduces, or, completely, removes, these, components, from, the, chickpea, cooking, also, significantly, reduces, fat, and, mineral, content, the, b, vitamins, riboflavin, thiamin, niacin, and, pyridoxine, dissolve, into, cooking, water, at, differing, rates, germination, of, chickpeas, improves, protein, digestibility, although, at, a, lower, level, than, cooking, germination, degrades, proteins, to, simple, peptides, improving, crude, protein, nonprotein, nitrogen, and, crude, fibre, content, germination, decreases, lysine, tryptophan, sulphur, and, total, aromatic, amino, acids, but, most, contents, are, still, higher, than, proposed, by, the, fao, who, reference, pattern, oligosaccharides, such, as, stachyose, and, raffinose, are, reduced, in, higher, amounts, during, germination, than, during, cooking, minerals, and, b, vitamins, are, retained, more, effectively, during, germination, than, with, cooking, phytic, acids, are, reduced, significantly, but, trypsin, inhibitor, tannin, and, saponin, reduction, is, less, effective, than, cooking, in, a, 2002, study, comparing, germination, and, cooking, effects, on, chickpea, nutritional, values, all, treatments, of, cooking, autoclaving, microwave, cooking, boiling, were, found, to, improve, protein, digestibility, essential, amino, acids, were, slightly, increased, by, boiling, and, microwave, cooking, compared, to, autoclaving, and, germination, losses, in, b, vitamins, and, minerals, in, chickpeas, cooked, by, microwaving, were, smaller, than, in, those, cooked, by, boiling, and, autoclaving, chickpeas, contain, oligosaccharides, raffinose, stachyose, and, verbascose, which, are, indigestible, to, humans, but, are, fermented, in, the, gut, by, bacteria, leading, to, flatulence, in, susceptible, individuals, this, can, be, prevented, by, skinning, the, husks, from, the, chickpeas, before, serving, in, some, parts, of, the, world, young, chickpea, leaves, are, consumed, as, cooked, green, vegetables, especially, in, malnourished, populations, it, can, supplement, important, dietary, nutrients, because, regions, where, chickpeas, are, consumed, have, sometimes, been, found, to, have, populations, lacking, micronutrients, chickpea, leaves, have, a, significantly, higher, mineral, content, than, either, cabbage, leaves, or, spinach, leaves, environmental, factors, and, nutrient, availability, could, influence, mineral, concentrations, in, natural, settings, consumption, of, chickpea, leaves, may, contribute, nutrients, to, the, diet, the, consumption, of, chickpeas, is, under, preliminary, research, for, the, potential, to, improve, nutrition, and, affect, chronic, diseases, agricultural, yield, for, chickpeas, is, often, based, on, genetic, and, phenotypic, variability, which, has, recently, been, influenced, by, artificial, selection, the, uptake, of, macronutrients, such, as, inorganic, phosphorus, or, nitrogen, is, vital, to, the, plant, development, of, cicer, arietinum, commonly, known, as, the, perennial, chickpea, heat, cultivation, and, macronutrient, coupling, are, two, relatively, unknown, methods, used, to, increase, the, yield, and, size, of, the, chickpea, recent, research, has, indicated, that, a, combination, of, heat, treatment, along, with, the, two, vital, macronutrients, phosphorus, and, nitrogen, are, the, most, critical, components, to, increasing, the, overall, yield, of, cicer, arietinum, perennial, chickpeas, are, a, fundamental, source, of, nutrition, in, animal, feed, as, they, are, high, energy, and, protein, sources, for, livestock, unlike, other, food, crops, the, perennial, chickpea, can, change, its, nutritional, content, in, response, to, heat, cultivation, treating, the, chickpea, with, a, constant, heat, source, increases, its, protein, content, almost, threefold, consequently, the, impact, of, heat, cultivation, affects, the, protein, content, of, the, chickpea, itself, and, the, ecosystem, it, supports, increasing, the, height, and, size, of, chickpea, plants, involves, using, macronutrient, fertilization, with, varying, doses, of, inorganic, phosphorus, and, nitrogen, the, level, of, phosphorus, that, a, chickpea, seed, is, exposed, to, during, its, lifecycle, has, a, positive, correlation, relative, to, the, height, of, the, plant, at, full, maturity, increasing, the, levels, of, inorganic, phosphorus, at, all, doses, incrementally, increases, the, height, of, the, chickpea, plant, thus, the, seasonal, changes, in, phosphorus, soil, content, as, well, as, periods, of, drought, that, are, known, to, be, a, native, characteristic, of, the, dry, middle, eastern, region, where, the, chickpea, is, most, commonly, cultivated, have, a, strong, effect, on, the, growth, of, the, plant, itself, plant, yield, is, also, affected, by, a, combination, of, phosphorus, nutrition, and, water, supply, resulting, in, a, 12, increase, in, crop, yield, nitrogen, nutrition, is, another, factor, that, affects, the, yield, of, cicer, arietinum, although, the, application, differs, from, other, perennial, crops, regarding, the, levels, administered, on, the, plant, high, doses, of, nitrogen, inhibit, the, yield, of, the, chickpea, plant, drought, stress, is, a, likely, factor, that, inhibits, nitrogen, uptake, and, subsequent, fixation, in, the, roots, of, cicer, arietinum, the, perennial, chickpea, s, growth, depends, on, the, balance, between, nitrogen, fixation, and, assimilation, which, is, also, characteristic, of, many, other, agricultural, plant, types, the, influence, of, drought, stress, sowing, date, and, mineral, nitrogen, supply, affect, the, plant, s, yield, and, size, with, trials, showing, that, cicer, arietinum, differed, from, other, plant, species, in, its, capacity, to, assimilate, mineral, nitrogen, supply, from, the, soil, during, drought, stress, additional, minerals, and, micronutrients, make, the, absorption, process, of, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, more, available, inorganic, phosphate, ions, are, generally, attracted, towards, charged, minerals, such, as, iron, and, aluminium, oxides, additionally, growth, and, yield, are, also, limited, by, the, micronutrients, zinc, and, boron, deficiencies, in, the, soil, boron, rich, soil, increased, chickpea, yield, and, size, while, soil, fertilization, with, zinc, seemed, to, have, no, apparent, effect, on, the, chickpea, yield, pathogens, in, chickpeas, are, the, main, cause, of, yield, loss, up, to, 90, one, example, is, the, fungus, fusarium, oxysporum, f, sp, ciceris, present, in, most, of, the, major, pulse, crop, growing, areas, and, causing, regular, yield, damages, between, 10, and, 15, many, plant, hosts, produce, heat, shock, protein, 70s, including, c, arietinum, in, response, to, f, o, ciceris, gupta, et, al, 2017, finds, c, arietinum, produces, an, orthologue, of, athsp70, 1, an, arabidopsis, hsp70, from, 1978, until, 1995, the, worldwide, number, of, pathogens, increased, from, 49, to, 172, of, which, 35, were, recorded, in, india, these, pathogens, originate, from, groups, of, bacteria, fungi, viruses, mycoplasma, and, nematodes, and, show, a, high, genotypic, variation, the, most, widely, distributed, pathogens, are, ascochyta, rabiei, 35, countries, fusarium, oxysporum, f, sp, ciceris, 32, countries, uromyces, ciceris, arietini, 25, countries, bean, leafroll, virus, 23, countries, and, macrophomina, phaseolina, 21, countries, ascochyta, disease, emergence, is, favoured, by, wet, weather, spores, are, carried, to, new, plants, by, wind, and, water, splash, the, stagnation, of, yield, improvement, over, the, last, decades, is, linked, to, the, susceptibility, to, pathogens, research, for, yield, improvement, such, as, an, attempt, to, increase, yield, from, 0, 8, to, 2, 0, metric, tons, per, hectare, 0, 32, to, 0, 80, long, ton, acre, 0, 36, to, 0, 89, short, ton, acre, by, breeding, cold, resistant, varieties, is, always, linked, with, pathogen, resistance, breeding, as, pathogens, such, as, ascochyta, rabiei, and, f, o, f, sp, ciceris, flourish, in, conditions, such, as, cold, temperature, research, started, selecting, favourable, genes, for, pathogen, resistance, and, other, traits, through, marker, assisted, selection, this, method, is, a, promising, sign, for, the, future, to, achieve, significant, yield, improvements
