cathartes, coragyps, gymnogyps, sarcoramphus, vultur, cathartidae, known, commonly, as, new, world, vultures, or, condors, are, a, family, of, birds, of, prey, consisting, of, seven, extant, species, in, five, genera, it, includes, five, extant, vultures, and, two, extant, condors, found, in, the, americas, they, are, known, as, new, world, vultures, to, distinguish, them, from, old, world, vultures, with, which, the, cathartidae, does, not, form, a, single, clade, despite, the, two, being, similar, in, appearance, and, behavior, as, a, result, of, convergent, evolution, like, other, vultures, new, world, vultures, are, scavengers, having, evolved, to, feed, off, of, the, carcasses, of, dead, animals, without, any, notable, ill, effects, some, species, of, new, world, vulture, have, a, good, sense, of, smell, whereas, old, world, vultures, find, carcasses, exclusively, by, sight, other, adaptations, shared, by, both, old, and, new, world, vultures, include, a, bald, head, devoid, of, feathers, to, prevent, rotting, matter, from, accumulating, while, feeding, and, an, extremely, disease, resistant, digestive, system, to, protect, against, scavenging, related, germs, the, family, cathartidae, was, introduced, as, the, subfamily, cathartinae, by, the, french, ornithologist, fr, d, ric, de, lafresnaye, in, 1839, the, new, world, vultures, comprise, seven, species, in, five, genera, being, coragyps, cathartes, gymnogyps, sarcoramphus, and, vultur, of, these, only, cathartes, is, not, monotypic, the, family, s, scientific, name, cathartidae, comes, from, cathartes, greek, for, purifier, although, new, world, vultures, and, old, world, vultures, are, not, very, closely, related, they, share, many, resemblances, because, of, convergent, evolution, phylogenetic, analyses, including, all, cathartidae, species, found, two, primary, clades, the, first, consists, of, black, vultures, coragyps, atratus, together, with, the, three, cathartes, species, lesser, yellow, headed, vultures, c, burrovianus, greater, yellow, headed, vultures, c, melambrotus, and, turkey, vultures, c, aura, while, the, second, consists, of, king, vultures, sarcoramphus, papa, california, condors, gymnogyps, californianus, and, andean, condors, vultur, gryphus, new, world, vultures, were, traditionally, placed, in, a, family, of, their, own, in, the, falconiformes, however, in, the, late, 20th, century, some, ornithologists, argued, that, they, are, more, closely, related, to, storks, on, the, basis, of, karyotype, morphological, and, behavioral, data, thus, some, authorities, placed, them, in, the, ciconiiformes, with, storks, and, herons, sibley, and, monroe, 1990, even, considered, them, a, subfamily, of, the, storks, this, was, criticized, and, an, early, dna, sequence, study, was, based, on, erroneous, data, and, subsequently, retracted, there, was, then, an, attempt, to, raise, the, new, world, vultures, to, the, rank, of, an, independent, order, cathartiformes, not, closely, associated, with, either, the, birds, of, prey, or, the, storks, and, herons, recent, multi, locus, dna, studies, on, the, evolutionary, relationships, between, bird, groups, indicate, that, new, world, vultures, are, related, to, the, other, birds, of, prey, excluding, the, falconidae, this, analysis, argues, that, new, world, vultures, should, either, be, a, part, of, a, new, order, accipitriformes, or, part, of, an, order, cathartiformes, closely, related, to, but, distinct, from, other, birds, of, prey, new, world, vultures, are, a, sister, group, to, accipitriformes, a, group, consisting, of, accipitridae, the, osprey, and, secretarybird, both, groups, are, basal, members, of, the, recently, recognized, clade, afroaves, the, fossil, history, of, the, cathartidae, is, complex, and, many, taxa, that, may, possibly, have, been, new, world, vultures, have, at, some, stage, been, treated, as, early, representatives, of, the, family, there, is, no, unequivocal, european, record, from, the, neogene, it, is, clear, that, the, cathartidae, had, a, much, higher, diversity, in, the, plio, pleistocene, rivalling, the, current, diversity, of, old, world, vultures, and, their, relatives, in, shapes, sizes, and, ecological, niches, extinct, taxa, include, new, world, vultures, are, generally, large, ranging, in, length, from, the, lesser, yellow, headed, vulture, at, 56, 61, centimeters, 22, 24, inches, up, to, the, california, and, andean, condors, both, of, which, can, reach, 120, centimeters, 48, inches, in, length, and, weigh, 12, or, more, kilograms, 26, or, more, pounds, plumage, is, predominantly, black, or, brown, and, is, sometimes, marked, with, white, all, species, have, featherless, heads, and, necks, in, some, this, skin, is, brightly, colored, and, in, the, king, vulture, it, is, developed, into, colorful, wattles, and, outgrowths, all, new, world, vultures, have, long, broad, wings, and, a, stiff, tail, suitable, for, soaring, they, are, the, best, adapted, to, soaring, of, all, land, birds, the, feet, are, clawed, but, weak, and, not, adapted, to, grasping, the, front, toes, are, long, with, small, webs, at, their, bases, no, new, world, vulture, possesses, a, syrinx, the, vocal, organ, of, birds, therefore, the, voice, is, limited, to, infrequent, grunts, and, hisses, the, beak, is, slightly, hooked, and, is, relatively, weak, compared, with, those, of, other, birds, of, prey, this, is, because, it, is, adapted, to, tear, the, weak, flesh, of, partially, rotted, carrion, rather, than, fresh, meat, the, nostrils, are, oval, and, set, in, a, soft, cere, the, nasal, passage, is, perforate, not, divided, by, a, septum, so, that, when, looking, from, the, side, one, can, see, through, the, beak, the, eyes, are, prominent, and, unlike, those, of, eagles, hawks, and, falcons, they, are, not, shaded, by, a, brow, bone, members, of, coragyps, and, cathartes, have, a, single, incomplete, row, of, eyelashes, on, the, upper, lid, and, two, rows, on, the, lower, lid, while, gymnogyps, vultur, and, sarcoramphus, lack, eyelashes, altogether, new, world, vultures, have, the, unusual, habit, of, urohidrosis, or, defecating, on, their, legs, to, cool, them, evaporatively, as, this, behavior, is, also, present, in, storks, it, is, one, of, the, arguments, for, a, close, relationship, between, the, two, groups, new, world, vultures, are, restricted, to, the, western, hemisphere, ranging, from, southern, canada, to, south, america, most, species, are, mainly, resident, but, the, turkey, vulture, breeds, in, canada, and, the, northern, us, and, migrates, south, in, the, northern, winter, new, world, vultures, inhabit, a, large, variety, of, habitats, and, ecosystems, ranging, from, deserts, to, tropical, rainforests, and, at, heights, of, sea, level, to, mountain, ranges, using, their, highly, adapted, sense, of, smell, to, locate, carrion, these, species, of, birds, are, also, occasionally, seen, in, human, settlements, perhaps, emerging, to, feed, upon, the, food, sources, provided, from, roadkills, new, world, vultures, and, condors, do, not, build, nests, but, lay, eggs, on, bare, surfaces, on, average, one, to, three, eggs, are, laid, depending, on, the, species, chicks, are, naked, on, hatching, and, later, grow, down, like, most, birds, the, parents, feed, the, young, by, regurgitation, the, young, are, altricial, fledging, in, 2, to, 3, months, california, condor, chicks, fledge, anywhere, from, 5, 6, months, while, andean, condor, chicks, fledge, anywhere, from, 6, 10, months, all, living, species, of, new, world, vultures, and, condors, are, scavengers, their, diet, consists, primarily, of, carrion, and, they, are, commonly, seen, near, carcasses, other, additions, to, the, diet, include, fruit, especially, rotten, fruit, and, garbage, the, genus, cathartes, locates, carrion, by, detecting, the, scent, of, ethyl, mercaptan, a, gas, produced, by, the, bodies, of, decaying, animals, the, olfactory, lobe, of, the, brains, in, these, species, which, is, responsible, for, processing, smells, is, particularly, large, compared, to, that, of, other, animals, other, species, such, as, the, american, black, vulture, and, the, king, vulture, have, weak, senses, of, smell, and, find, food, only, by, sight, sometimes, by, following, cathartes, vultures, and, other, scavengers, vultures, possess, a, very, acidic, digestive, system, with, their, gut, dominated, by, two, species, of, anaerobic, bacteria, that, help, them, withstand, toxins, present, in, decaying, prey, in, a, 2014, study, of, 50, turkey, and, black, vultures, researchers, analyzed, the, microbial, community, or, microbiome, of, the, facial, skin, and, the, large, intestine, the, facial, bacterial, flora, and, the, gut, flora, overlapped, somewhat, but, in, general, the, facial, flora, was, much, more, diverse, than, the, gut, flora, which, is, in, contrast, to, other, vertebrates, where, the, gut, flora, is, more, diverse, two, anaerobic, faecal, bacteria, groups, that, are, pathogenic, in, other, vertebrates, stood, out, clostridia, and, fusobacteriota, formerly, fusobacteria, they, were, especially, common, in, the, gut, with, clostridia, dna, sequence, counts, between, 26, and, 85, relative, to, total, sequence, counts, and, fusobacteriota, between, 0, 2, and, 54, in, black, vultures, and, 2, to, 69, of, all, counts, in, turkey, vultures, unexpectedly, both, groups, of, anaerobic, bacteria, were, also, found, on, the, air, exposed, facial, skin, samples, with, clostridia, at, 7, 40, and, fusobacteriota, up, to, 23, it, is, assumed, that, vultures, acquire, them, when, they, insert, their, heads, into, the, body, cavities, of, rotten, meat, the, regularly, ingested, clostridia, and, fusobacteriota, outcompete, other, bacterial, groups, in, the, gut, and, become, predominant, genes, that, encode, tissue, degrading, enzymes, and, toxins, that, are, associated, with, clostridium, perfringens, have, been, found, in, the, vulture, gut, metagenome, this, supports, the, hypothesis, that, vultures, do, benefit, from, the, bacterial, breakdown, of, carrion, while, at, the, same, time, tolerating, the, bacterial, toxins, the, california, condor, is, critically, endangered, it, formerly, ranged, from, baja, california, to, british, columbia, but, by, 1937, was, restricted, to, california, in, 1987, all, surviving, birds, were, removed, from, the, wild, into, a, captive, breeding, program, to, ensure, the, species, survival, in, 2005, there, were, 127, californian, condors, in, the, wild, as, of, october, 31, 2009, there, were, 180, birds, in, the, wild, the, andean, condor, is, vulnerable, the, american, black, vulture, turkey, vulture, lesser, yellow, headed, vulture, and, greater, yellow, headed, vulture, are, listed, as, species, of, least, concern, by, the, iucn, red, list, the, king, vulture, is, also, listed, as, least, concern, although, there, is, evidence, of, a, decline, in, the, population, the, american, black, vulture, and, the, king, vulture, appear, in, a, variety, of, maya, hieroglyphs, in, mayan, codices, the, king, vulture, is, commonly, represented, with, its, glyph, being, easily, distinguishable, by, the, knob, on, the, bird, s, beak, and, by, the, concentric, circles, that, represent, the, bird, s, eyes, it, is, sometimes, portrayed, as, a, god, with, a, human, body, and, a, bird, head, according, to, mayan, mythology, this, god, often, carried, messages, between, humans, and, the, other, gods, it, is, also, used, to, represent, cozcaquauhtli, the, thirteenth, day, of, the, month, in, the, mayan, calendar, meanwhile, the, american, black, vulture, is, normally, connected, with, death, or, shown, as, a, bird, of, prey, and, its, glyph, is, often, depicted, attacking, humans, this, species, lacks, the, religious, connections, that, the, king, vulture, has, while, some, of, the, glyphs, clearly, show, the, american, black, vulture, s, open, nostril, and, hooked, beak, some, are, assumed, to, be, this, species, because, they, are, vulture, like, painted, black, and, lack, the, king, vulture, s, knob
