neurology, from, greek, ne, ron, string, nerve, and, the, suffix, logia, study, of, is, the, branch, of, medicine, dealing, with, the, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, all, categories, of, conditions, and, disease, involving, the, nervous, system, which, comprises, the, brain, the, spinal, cord, and, the, peripheral, nerves, neurological, practice, relies, heavily, on, the, field, of, neuroscience, the, scientific, study, of, the, nervous, system, a, neurologist, is, a, physician, specializing, in, neurology, and, trained, to, investigate, diagnose, and, treat, neurological, disorders, neurologists, diagnose, and, treat, myriad, neurologic, conditions, including, stroke, epilepsy, movement, disorders, such, as, parkinson, s, disease, brain, infections, autoimmune, neurologic, disorders, such, as, multiple, sclerosis, sleep, disorders, brain, injury, headache, disorders, like, migraine, tumors, of, the, brain, and, dementias, such, as, alzheimer, s, disease, neurologists, may, also, have, roles, in, clinical, research, clinical, trials, and, basic, or, translational, research, neurology, is, a, nonsurgical, specialty, its, corresponding, surgical, specialty, is, neurosurgery, the, academic, discipline, began, between, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, with, the, work, and, research, of, many, neurologists, such, as, thomas, willis, robert, whytt, matthew, baillie, charles, bell, moritz, heinrich, romberg, duchenne, de, boulogne, william, a, hammond, jean, martin, charcot, c, miller, fisher, and, john, hughlings, jackson, neo, latin, neurologia, appeared, in, various, texts, from, 1610, denoting, an, anatomical, focus, on, the, nerves, variably, understood, as, vessels, and, was, most, notably, used, by, willis, who, preferred, greek, in, the, united, states, and, canada, neurologists, are, physicians, who, have, completed, a, postgraduate, training, period, known, as, residency, specializing, in, neurology, after, graduation, from, medical, school, this, additional, training, period, typically, lasts, four, years, with, the, first, year, devoted, to, training, in, internal, medicine, on, average, neurologists, complete, a, total, of, eight, to, ten, years, of, training, this, includes, four, years, of, medical, school, four, years, of, residency, and, an, optional, one, to, two, years, of, fellowship, while, neurologists, may, treat, general, neurologic, conditions, some, neurologists, go, on, to, receive, additional, training, focusing, on, a, particular, subspecialty, in, the, field, of, neurology, these, training, programs, are, called, fellowships, and, are, one, to, three, years, in, duration, subspecialties, in, the, united, states, include, brain, injury, medicine, clinical, neurophysiology, epilepsy, neurodevelopmental, disabilities, neuromuscular, medicine, pain, medicine, sleep, medicine, neurocritical, care, vascular, neurology, stroke, behavioral, neurology, headache, neuroimmunology, and, infectious, disease, movement, disorders, neuroimaging, neurooncology, and, neurorehabilitation, in, germany, a, compulsory, year, of, psychiatry, must, be, done, to, complete, a, residency, of, neurology, in, the, united, kingdom, and, ireland, neurology, is, a, subspecialty, of, general, internal, medicine, after, five, years, of, medical, school, and, two, years, as, a, foundation, trainee, an, aspiring, neurologist, must, pass, the, examination, for, membership, of, the, royal, college, of, physicians, or, the, irish, equivalent, and, complete, two, years, of, core, medical, training, before, entering, specialist, training, in, neurology, up, to, the, 1960s, some, intending, to, become, neurologists, would, also, spend, two, years, working, in, psychiatric, units, before, obtaining, a, diploma, in, psychological, medicine, however, that, was, uncommon, and, now, that, the, mrcpsych, takes, three, years, to, obtain, would, no, longer, be, practical, a, period, of, research, is, essential, and, obtaining, a, higher, degree, aids, career, progression, many, found, it, was, eased, after, an, attachment, to, the, institute, of, neurology, at, queen, square, london, some, neurologists, enter, the, field, of, rehabilitation, medicine, known, as, physiatry, in, the, us, to, specialise, in, neurological, rehabilitation, which, may, include, stroke, medicine, as, well, as, traumatic, brain, injuries, during, a, neurological, examination, the, neurologist, reviews, the, patient, s, health, history, with, special, attention, to, the, patient, s, neurologic, complaints, the, patient, then, takes, a, neurological, exam, typically, the, exam, tests, mental, status, function, of, the, cranial, nerves, including, vision, strength, coordination, reflexes, sensation, and, gait, this, information, helps, the, neurologist, determine, whether, the, problem, exists, in, the, nervous, system, and, the, clinical, localization, localization, of, the, pathology, is, the, key, process, by, which, neurologists, develop, their, differential, diagnosis, further, tests, may, be, needed, to, confirm, a, diagnosis, and, ultimately, guide, therapy, and, appropriate, management, useful, adjunct, imaging, studies, in, neurology, include, ct, scanning, and, mri, other, tests, used, to, assess, muscle, and, nerve, function, include, nerve, conduction, studies, and, electromyography, neurologists, examine, patients, who, are, referred, to, them, by, other, physicians, in, both, the, inpatient, and, outpatient, settings, neurologists, begin, their, interactions, with, patients, by, taking, a, comprehensive, medical, history, and, then, performing, a, physical, examination, focusing, on, evaluating, the, nervous, system, components, of, the, neurological, examination, include, assessment, of, the, patient, s, cognitive, function, cranial, nerves, motor, strength, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and, gait, in, some, instances, neurologists, may, order, additional, diagnostic, tests, as, part, of, the, evaluation, commonly, employed, tests, in, neurology, include, imaging, studies, such, as, computed, axial, tomography, cat, scans, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, and, ultrasound, of, major, blood, vessels, of, the, head, and, neck, neurophysiologic, studies, including, electroencephalography, eeg, needle, electromyography, emg, nerve, conduction, studies, ncss, and, evoked, potentials, are, also, commonly, ordered, neurologists, frequently, perform, lumbar, punctures, to, assess, characteristics, of, a, patient, s, cerebrospinal, fluid, advances, in, genetic, testing, have, made, genetic, testing, an, important, tool, in, the, classification, of, inherited, neuromuscular, disease, and, diagnosis, of, many, other, neurogenetic, diseases, the, role, of, genetic, influences, on, the, development, of, acquired, neurologic, diseases, is, an, active, area, of, research, some, of, the, commonly, encountered, conditions, treated, by, neurologists, include, headaches, radiculopathy, neuropathy, stroke, dementia, seizures, and, epilepsy, alzheimer, s, disease, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, parkinson, s, disease, tourette, s, syndrome, multiple, sclerosis, head, trauma, sleep, disorders, neuromuscular, diseases, and, various, infections, and, tumors, of, the, nervous, system, neurologists, are, also, asked, to, evaluate, unresponsive, patients, on, life, support, to, confirm, brain, death, treatment, options, vary, depending, on, the, neurological, problem, they, can, include, referring, the, patient, to, a, physiotherapist, prescribing, medications, or, recommending, a, surgical, procedure, some, neurologists, specialize, in, certain, parts, of, the, nervous, system, or, in, specific, procedures, for, example, clinical, neurophysiologists, specialize, in, the, use, of, eeg, and, intraoperative, monitoring, to, diagnose, certain, neurological, disorders, other, neurologists, specialize, in, the, use, of, electrodiagnostic, medicine, studies, needle, emg, and, ncss, in, the, us, physicians, do, not, typically, specialize, in, all, the, aspects, of, clinical, neurophysiology, i, e, sleep, eeg, emg, and, ncss, the, american, board, of, clinical, neurophysiology, certifies, us, physicians, in, general, clinical, neurophysiology, epilepsy, and, intraoperative, monitoring, the, american, board, of, electrodiagnostic, medicine, certifies, us, physicians, in, electrodiagnostic, medicine, and, certifies, technologists, in, nerve, conduction, studies, sleep, medicine, is, a, subspecialty, field, in, the, us, under, several, medical, specialties, including, anesthesiology, internal, medicine, family, medicine, and, neurology, neurosurgery, is, a, distinct, specialty, that, involves, a, different, training, path, and, emphasizes, the, surgical, treatment, of, neurological, disorders, also, many, nonmedical, doctors, those, with, doctoral, degrees, usually, phds, in, subjects, such, as, biology, and, chemistry, study, and, research, the, nervous, system, working, in, laboratories, in, universities, hospitals, and, private, companies, these, neuroscientists, perform, clinical, and, laboratory, experiments, and, tests, to, learn, more, about, the, nervous, system, and, find, cures, or, new, treatments, for, diseases, and, disorders, a, great, deal, of, overlap, occurs, between, neuroscience, and, neurology, many, neurologists, work, in, academic, training, hospitals, where, they, conduct, research, as, neuroscientists, in, addition, to, treating, patients, and, teaching, neurology, to, medical, students, neurologists, are, responsible, for, the, diagnosis, treatment, and, management, of, all, the, conditions, mentioned, above, when, surgical, or, endovascular, intervention, is, required, the, neurologist, may, refer, the, patient, to, a, neurosurgeon, or, an, interventional, neuroradiologist, in, some, countries, additional, legal, responsibilities, of, a, neurologist, may, include, making, a, finding, of, brain, death, when, it, is, suspected, that, a, patient, has, died, neurologists, frequently, care, for, people, with, hereditary, genetic, diseases, when, the, major, manifestations, are, neurological, as, is, frequently, the, case, lumbar, punctures, are, frequently, performed, by, neurologists, some, neurologists, may, develop, an, interest, in, particular, subfields, such, as, stroke, dementia, movement, disorders, neurointensive, care, headaches, epilepsy, sleep, disorders, chronic, pain, management, multiple, sclerosis, or, neuromuscular, diseases, some, overlap, also, occurs, with, other, specialties, varying, from, country, to, country, and, even, within, a, local, geographic, area, acute, head, trauma, is, most, often, treated, by, neurosurgeons, whereas, sequelae, of, head, trauma, may, be, treated, by, neurologists, or, specialists, in, rehabilitation, medicine, although, stroke, cases, have, been, traditionally, managed, by, internal, medicine, or, hospitalists, the, emergence, of, vascular, neurology, and, interventional, neuroradiology, has, created, a, demand, for, stroke, specialists, the, establishment, of, joint, commission, certified, stroke, centers, has, increased, the, role, of, neurologists, in, stroke, care, in, many, primary, as, well, as, tertiary, hospitals, some, cases, of, nervous, system, infectious, diseases, are, treated, by, infectious, disease, specialists, most, cases, of, headache, are, diagnosed, and, treated, primarily, by, general, practitioners, at, least, the, less, severe, cases, likewise, most, cases, of, sciatica, are, treated, by, general, practitioners, though, they, may, be, referred, to, neurologists, or, surgeons, neurosurgeons, or, orthopedic, surgeons, sleep, disorders, are, also, treated, by, pulmonologists, and, psychiatrists, cerebral, palsy, is, initially, treated, by, pediatricians, but, care, may, be, transferred, to, an, adult, neurologist, after, the, patient, reaches, a, certain, age, physical, medicine, and, rehabilitation, physicians, may, treat, patients, with, neuromuscular, diseases, with, electrodiagnostic, studies, needle, emg, and, nerve, conduction, studies, and, other, diagnostic, tools, in, the, united, kingdom, and, other, countries, many, of, the, conditions, encountered, by, older, patients, such, as, movement, disorders, including, parkinson, s, disease, stroke, dementia, or, gait, disorders, are, managed, predominantly, by, specialists, in, geriatric, medicine, clinical, neuropsychologists, are, often, called, upon, to, evaluate, brain, behavior, relationships, for, the, purpose, of, assisting, with, differential, diagnosis, planning, rehabilitation, strategies, documenting, cognitive, strengths, and, weaknesses, and, measuring, change, over, time, e, g, for, identifying, abnormal, aging, or, tracking, the, progression, of, a, dementia, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, states, and, germany, neurologists, may, subspecialize, in, clinical, neurophysiology, the, field, responsible, for, eeg, and, intraoperative, monitoring, or, in, electrodiagnostic, medicine, nerve, conduction, studies, emg, and, evoked, potentials, in, other, countries, this, is, an, autonomous, specialty, e, g, united, kingdom, sweden, spain, in, the, past, prior, to, the, advent, of, more, advanced, diagnostic, techniques, such, as, mri, some, neurologists, have, considered, psychiatry, and, neurology, to, overlap, although, mental, illnesses, are, believed, by, many, to, be, neurological, disorders, affecting, the, central, nervous, system, traditionally, they, are, classified, separately, and, treated, by, psychiatrists, in, a, 2002, review, article, in, the, american, journal, of, psychiatry, professor, joseph, b, martin, dean, of, harvard, medical, school, and, a, neurologist, by, training, wrote, the, separation, of, the, two, categories, is, arbitrary, often, influenced, by, beliefs, rather, than, proven, scientific, observations, and, the, fact, that, the, brain, and, mind, are, one, makes, the, separation, artificial, anyway, neurological, disorders, often, have, psychiatric, manifestations, such, as, post, stroke, depression, depression, and, dementia, associated, with, parkinson, s, disease, mood, and, cognitive, dysfunctions, in, alzheimer, s, disease, and, huntington, disease, to, name, a, few, hence, the, sharp, distinction, between, neurology, and, psychiatry, is, not, always, on, a, biological, basis, the, dominance, of, psychoanalytic, theory, in, the, first, three, quarters, of, the, 20th, century, has, since, then, been, largely, replaced, by, a, focus, on, pharmacology, despite, the, shift, to, a, medical, model, brain, science, has, not, advanced, to, a, point, where, scientists, or, clinicians, can, point, to, readily, discernible, pathological, lesions, or, genetic, abnormalities, that, in, and, of, themselves, serve, as, reliable, or, predictive, biomarkers, of, a, given, mental, disorder, the, emerging, field, of, neurological, enhancement, highlights, the, potential, of, therapies, to, improve, such, things, as, workplace, efficacy, attention, in, school, and, overall, happiness, in, personal, lives, however, this, field, has, also, given, rise, to, questions, about, neuroethics
