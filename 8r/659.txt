see, text, the, honeyeaters, are, a, large, and, diverse, family, meliphagidae, of, small, to, medium, sized, birds, the, family, includes, the, australian, chats, myzomelas, friarbirds, wattlebirds, miners, and, melidectes, they, are, most, common, in, australia, and, new, guinea, and, found, also, in, new, zealand, the, pacific, islands, as, far, east, as, samoa, and, tonga, and, the, islands, to, the, north, and, west, of, new, guinea, known, as, wallacea, bali, on, the, other, side, of, the, wallace, line, has, a, single, species, in, total, there, are, 186, species, in, 55, genera, roughly, half, of, them, native, to, australia, many, of, the, remainder, occupying, new, guinea, with, their, closest, relatives, the, maluridae, australian, fairy, wrens, pardalotidae, pardalotes, and, acanthizidae, thornbills, australian, warblers, scrubwrens, etc, they, comprise, the, superfamily, meliphagoidea, and, originated, early, in, the, evolutionary, history, of, the, oscine, passerine, radiation, although, honeyeaters, look, and, behave, very, much, like, other, nectar, feeding, passerines, around, the, world, such, as, the, sunbirds, and, flowerpeckers, they, are, unrelated, and, the, similarities, are, the, consequence, of, convergent, evolution, the, extent, of, the, evolutionary, partnership, between, honeyeaters, and, australasian, flowering, plants, is, unknown, but, probably, substantial, a, great, many, australian, plants, are, fertilised, by, honeyeaters, particularly, the, proteaceae, myrtaceae, and, ericaceae, it, is, known, that, the, honeyeaters, are, important, in, new, zealand, see, anthornis, as, well, and, assumed, that, the, same, applies, in, other, areas, honeyeaters, can, be, either, nectarivorous, insectivorous, frugivorous, or, a, combination, of, nectar, and, insect, eating, unlike, the, hummingbirds, of, america, honeyeaters, do, not, have, extensive, adaptations, for, hovering, flight, though, smaller, members, of, the, family, do, hover, hummingbird, style, to, collect, nectar, from, time, to, time, in, general, honeyeaters, prefer, to, flit, quickly, from, perch, to, perch, in, the, outer, foliage, stretching, up, or, sideways, or, hanging, upside, down, at, need, many, genera, have, a, highly, developed, brush, tipped, tongue, frayed, and, fringed, with, bristles, which, soak, up, liquids, readily, the, tongue, is, flicked, rapidly, and, repeatedly, into, a, flower, the, upper, mandible, then, compressing, any, liquid, out, when, the, bill, is, closed, in, addition, to, nectar, all, or, nearly, all, honeyeaters, take, insects, and, other, small, creatures, usually, by, hawking, sometimes, by, gleaning, a, few, of, the, larger, species, notably, the, white, eared, honeyeater, and, the, strong, billed, honeyeater, of, tasmania, probe, under, bark, for, insects, and, other, morsels, many, species, supplement, their, diets, with, a, little, fruit, and, a, small, number, eat, considerable, amounts, of, fruit, particularly, in, tropical, rainforests, and, oddly, in, semi, arid, scrubland, the, painted, honeyeater, is, a, mistletoe, specialist, most, however, exist, on, a, diet, of, nectar, supplemented, by, varying, quantities, of, insects, in, general, the, honeyeaters, with, long, fine, bills, are, more, nectarivorous, the, shorter, billed, species, less, so, but, even, specialised, nectar, eaters, like, the, spinebills, take, extra, insects, to, add, protein, to, their, diet, when, breeding, the, movements, of, honeyeaters, are, poorly, understood, most, are, at, least, partially, mobile, but, many, movements, seem, to, be, local, possibly, between, favourite, haunts, as, the, conditions, change, fluctuations, in, local, abundance, are, common, but, the, small, number, of, definitely, migratory, honeyeater, species, aside, the, reasons, are, yet, to, be, discovered, many, follow, the, flowering, of, favourite, food, plants, arid, zone, species, appear, to, travel, further, and, less, predictably, than, those, of, the, more, fertile, areas, it, seems, probable, that, no, single, explanation, will, emerge, the, general, rule, for, honeyeater, movements, is, that, there, is, no, general, rule, the, genera, cleptornis, golden, honeyeater, and, apalopteron, bonin, honeyeater, formerly, treated, in, the, meliphagidae, have, recently, been, transferred, to, the, zosteropidae, on, genetic, evidence, the, genus, notiomystis, new, zealand, stitchbird, formerly, classified, in, the, meliphagidae, has, recently, been, removed, to, the, newly, erected, notiomystidae, of, which, it, is, the, only, member, the, macgregor, s, bird, of, paradise, historically, considered, a, bird, of, paradise, paradisaeidae, was, recently, found, to, be, a, honeyeater, it, is, now, known, as, macgregor, s, honeyeater, and, is, classified, in, the, meliphagidae, the, wattled, smoky, honeyeater, melipotes, carolae, described, in, 2007, had, been, discovered, in, december, 2005, in, the, foja, mountains, of, papua, indonesia, in, 2008, a, study, that, included, molecular, phylogenetic, analysis, of, museum, specimens, in, the, genera, moho, and, chaetoptila, both, extinct, genera, endemic, to, the, hawaiian, islands, argued, that, these, five, species, were, not, members, of, the, meliphagidae, and, instead, belong, to, their, own, distinct, family, the, mohoidae
