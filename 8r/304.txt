https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile
an, extremophile, from, latin, extremus, extreme, and, ancient, greek, phil, a, love, is, an, organism, that, is, able, to, live, or, in, some, cases, thrive, in, extreme, environments, i, e, environments, with, conditions, approaching, or, stretching, the, limits, of, what, known, life, can, adapt, to, such, as, extreme, temperature, pressure, radiation, salinity, or, ph, level, since, the, definition, of, an, extreme, environment, is, relative, to, an, arbitrarily, defined, standard, often, an, anthropocentric, one, these, organisms, can, be, considered, ecologically, dominant, in, the, evolutionary, history, of, the, planet, some, spores, and, cocooned, bacteria, samples, have, been, dormant, for, more, than, 40, million, years, extremophiles, have, continued, to, thrive, in, the, most, extreme, conditions, making, them, one, of, the, most, abundant, lifeforms, the, study, of, extremophiles, has, expanded, human, knowledge, of, the, limits, of, life, and, informs, speculation, about, extraterrestrial, life, extremophiles, are, also, of, interest, because, of, their, potential, for, bioremediation, of, environments, made, hazardous, to, humans, due, to, pollution, or, contamination, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, biologists, found, that, microbial, life, has, great, flexibility, for, surviving, in, extreme, environments, niches, that, are, acidic, extraordinarily, hot, or, with, irregular, air, pressure, for, example, that, would, be, completely, inhospitable, to, complex, organisms, some, scientists, even, concluded, that, life, may, have, begun, on, earth, in, hydrothermal, vents, far, beneath, the, ocean, s, surface, according, to, astrophysicist, steinn, sigurdsson, there, are, viable, bacterial, spores, that, have, been, found, that, are, 40, million, years, old, on, earth, and, we, know, they, re, very, hardened, to, radiation, some, bacteria, were, found, living, in, the, cold, and, dark, in, a, lake, buried, a, half, mile, deep, under, the, ice, in, antarctica, and, in, the, marianas, trench, the, deepest, place, in, earth, s, oceans, expeditions, of, the, international, ocean, discovery, program, found, microorganisms, in, 120, c, 248, f, sediment, that, is, 1, 2, km, 0, 75, mi, below, seafloor, in, the, nankai, trough, subduction, zone, some, microorganisms, have, been, found, thriving, inside, rocks, up, to, 1, 900, feet, 580, m, below, the, sea, floor, under, 8, 500, feet, 2, 600, m, of, ocean, off, the, coast, of, the, northwestern, united, states, according, to, one, of, the, researchers, you, can, find, microbes, everywhere, they, re, extremely, adaptable, to, conditions, and, survive, wherever, they, are, a, key, to, extremophile, adaptation, is, their, amino, acid, composition, affecting, their, protein, folding, ability, under, particular, conditions, studying, extreme, environments, on, earth, can, help, researchers, understand, the, limits, of, habitability, on, other, worlds, tom, gheysens, from, ghent, university, in, belgium, and, some, of, his, colleagues, have, presented, research, findings, that, show, spores, from, a, species, of, bacillus, bacteria, survived, and, were, still, viable, after, being, heated, to, temperatures, of, 420, c, 788, f, there, are, many, classes, of, extremophiles, that, range, all, around, the, globe, each, corresponding, to, the, way, its, environmental, niche, differs, from, mesophilic, conditions, these, classifications, are, not, exclusive, many, extremophiles, fall, under, multiple, categories, and, are, classified, as, polyextremophiles, for, example, organisms, living, inside, hot, rocks, deep, under, earth, s, surface, are, thermophilic, and, piezophilic, such, as, thermococcus, barophilus, a, polyextremophile, living, at, the, summit, of, a, mountain, in, the, atacama, desert, might, be, a, radioresistant, xerophile, a, psychrophile, and, an, oligotroph, polyextremophiles, are, well, known, for, their, ability, to, tolerate, both, high, and, low, ph, levels, astrobiology, is, the, multidisciplinary, field, that, investigates, the, deterministic, conditions, and, contingent, events, with, which, life, arises, distributes, and, evolves, in, the, universe, astrobiology, makes, use, of, physics, chemistry, astronomy, solar, physics, biology, molecular, biology, ecology, planetary, science, geography, and, geology, to, investigate, the, possibility, of, life, on, other, worlds, and, help, recognize, biospheres, that, might, be, different, from, that, on, earth, astrobiologists, are, particularly, interested, in, studying, extremophiles, as, it, allows, them, to, map, what, is, known, about, the, limits, of, life, on, earth, to, potential, extraterrestrial, environments, for, example, analogous, deserts, of, antarctica, are, exposed, to, harmful, uv, radiation, low, temperature, high, salt, concentration, and, low, mineral, concentration, these, conditions, are, similar, to, those, on, mars, therefore, finding, viable, microbes, in, the, subsurface, of, antarctica, suggests, that, there, may, be, microbes, surviving, in, endolithic, communities, and, living, under, the, martian, surface, research, indicates, it, is, unlikely, that, martian, microbes, exist, on, the, surface, or, at, shallow, depths, but, may, be, found, at, subsurface, depths, of, around, 100, meters, recent, research, carried, out, on, extremophiles, in, japan, involved, a, variety, of, bacteria, including, escherichia, coli, and, paracoccus, denitrificans, being, subject, to, conditions, of, extreme, gravity, the, bacteria, were, cultivated, while, being, rotated, in, an, ultracentrifuge, at, high, speeds, corresponding, to, 403, 627, g, i, e, 403, 627, times, the, gravity, experienced, on, earth, p, denitrificans, was, one, of, the, bacteria, which, displayed, not, only, survival, but, also, robust, cellular, growth, under, these, conditions, of, hyperacceleration, which, are, usually, found, only, in, cosmic, environments, such, as, on, very, massive, stars, or, in, the, shock, waves, of, supernovas, analysis, showed, that, the, small, size, of, prokaryotic, cells, is, essential, for, successful, growth, under, hypergravity, the, research, has, implications, on, the, feasibility, of, panspermia, on, 26, april, 2012, scientists, reported, that, lichen, survived, and, showed, remarkable, results, on, the, adaptation, capacity, of, photosynthetic, activity, within, the, simulation, time, of, 34, days, under, martian, conditions, in, the, mars, simulation, laboratory, msl, maintained, by, the, german, aerospace, center, dlr, on, 29, april, 2013, scientists, at, rensselaer, polytechnic, institute, funded, by, nasa, reported, that, during, spaceflight, on, the, international, space, station, microbes, seem, to, adapt, to, the, space, environment, in, ways, not, observed, on, earth, and, in, ways, that, can, lead, to, increases, in, growth, and, virulence, on, 19, may, 2014, scientists, announced, that, numerous, microbes, like, tersicoccus, phoenicis, may, be, resistant, to, methods, usually, used, in, spacecraft, assembly, clean, rooms, it, is, not, currently, known, if, such, resistant, microbes, could, have, withstood, space, travel, and, are, present, on, the, curiosity, rover, now, on, the, planet, mars, on, 20, august, 2014, scientists, confirmed, the, existence, of, microorganisms, living, half, a, mile, below, the, ice, of, antarctica, in, september, 2015, scientists, from, cnr, national, research, council, of, italy, reported, that, s, soflataricus, was, able, to, survive, under, martian, radiation, at, a, wavelength, that, was, considered, extremely, lethal, to, most, bacteria, this, discovery, is, significant, because, it, indicates, that, not, only, bacterial, spores, but, also, growing, cells, can, be, remarkably, resistant, to, strong, uv, radiation, in, june, 2016, scientists, from, brigham, young, university, conclusively, reported, that, endospores, of, bacillus, subtilis, were, able, to, survive, high, speed, impacts, up, to, 299, 28, m, s, extreme, shock, and, extreme, deceleration, they, pointed, out, that, this, feature, might, allow, endospores, to, survive, and, to, be, transferred, between, planets, by, traveling, within, meteorites, or, by, experiencing, atmosphere, disruption, moreover, they, suggested, that, the, landing, of, spacecraft, may, also, result, in, interplanetary, spore, transfer, given, that, spores, can, survive, high, velocity, impact, while, ejected, from, the, spacecraft, onto, the, planet, surface, this, is, the, first, study, which, reported, that, bacteria, can, survive, in, such, high, velocity, impact, however, the, lethal, impact, speed, is, unknown, and, further, experiments, should, be, done, by, introducing, higher, velocity, impact, to, bacterial, endospores, in, august, 2020, scientists, reported, that, bacteria, that, feed, on, air, discovered, 2017, in, antarctica, are, likely, not, limited, to, antarctica, after, discovering, the, two, genes, previously, linked, to, their, atmospheric, chemosynthesis, in, soil, of, two, other, similar, cold, desert, sites, which, provides, further, information, on, this, carbon, sink, and, further, strengthens, the, extremophile, evidence, that, supports, the, potential, existence, of, microbial, life, on, alien, planets, the, same, month, scientists, reported, that, bacteria, from, earth, particularly, deinococcus, radiodurans, were, found, to, survive, for, three, years, in, outer, space, based, on, studies, on, the, international, space, station, these, findings, support, the, notion, of, panspermia, extremophiles, can, also, be, useful, players, in, the, bioremediation, of, contaminated, sites, as, some, species, are, capable, of, biodegradation, under, conditions, too, extreme, for, classic, bioremediation, candidate, species, anthropogenic, activity, causes, the, release, of, pollutants, that, may, potentially, settle, in, extreme, environments, as, is, the, case, with, tailings, and, sediment, released, from, deep, sea, mining, activity, while, most, bacteria, would, be, crushed, by, the, pressure, in, these, environments, piezophiles, can, tolerate, these, depths, and, can, metabolize, pollutants, of, concern, if, they, possess, bioremediation, potential, there, are, multiple, potential, destinations, for, hydrocarbons, after, an, oil, spill, has, settled, and, currents, routinely, deposit, them, in, extreme, environments, methane, bubbles, resulting, from, the, deepwater, horizon, oil, spill, were, found, 1, 1, kilometers, below, water, surface, level, and, at, concentrations, as, high, as, 183, mol, per, kilogram, the, combination, of, low, temperatures, and, high, pressures, in, this, environment, result, in, low, microbial, activity, however, bacteria, that, are, present, including, species, of, pseudomonas, aeromonas, and, vibrio, were, found, to, be, capable, of, bioremediation, albeit, at, a, tenth, of, the, speed, they, would, perform, at, sea, level, pressure, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, increase, in, solubility, and, bioavailability, with, increasing, temperature, thermophilic, thermus, and, bacillus, species, have, demonstrated, higher, gene, expression, for, the, alkane, mono, oxygenase, alkb, at, temperatures, exceeding, 60, c, 140, f, the, expression, of, this, gene, is, a, crucial, precursor, to, the, bioremediation, process, fungi, that, have, been, genetically, modified, with, cold, adapted, enzymes, to, tolerate, differing, ph, levels, and, temperatures, have, been, shown, to, be, effective, at, remediating, hydrocarbon, contamination, in, freezing, conditions, in, the, antarctic, acidithiubacillus, ferroxidans, has, been, shown, to, be, effective, in, remediating, mercury, in, acidic, soil, due, to, its, mera, gene, making, it, mercury, resistant, industrial, effluent, contain, high, levels, of, metals, that, can, be, detrimental, to, both, human, and, ecosystem, health, in, extreme, heat, environments, the, extremophile, geobacillus, thermodenitrificans, has, been, shown, to, effectively, manage, the, concentration, of, these, metals, within, twelve, hours, of, introduction, some, acidophilic, microorganisms, are, effective, at, metal, remediation, in, acidic, environments, due, to, proteins, found, in, their, periplasm, not, present, in, any, mesophilic, organisms, allowing, them, to, protect, themselves, from, high, proton, concentrations, rice, paddies, are, highly, oxidative, environments, that, can, produce, high, levels, of, lead, or, cadmium, deinococcus, radiodurans, are, resistant, to, the, harsh, conditions, of, the, environment, and, are, therefore, candidate, species, for, limiting, the, extent, of, contamination, of, these, metals, some, bacteria, are, known, to, also, use, rare, earth, elements, on, their, biological, processes, for, example, methylacidiphilum, fumariolicum, methylorubrum, extorquens, and, methylobacterium, radiotolerans, are, known, to, be, able, to, use, lanthanides, as, cofactors, to, increase, their, methanol, dehydrogenase, activity, acid, mine, drainage, is, a, major, environmental, concern, associated, with, many, metal, mines, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, this, highly, acidic, water, can, mix, with, groundwater, streams, and, lakes, the, drainage, turns, the, ph, in, these, water, sources, from, a, more, neutral, ph, to, a, ph, lower, than, 4, this, is, close, to, the, acidity, levels, of, battery, acid, or, stomach, acid, exposure, to, the, polluted, water, can, greatly, affect, the, health, of, plants, humans, and, animals, however, a, productive, method, of, remediation, is, to, introduce, the, extremophile, thiobacillus, ferrooxidans, this, extremophile, is, useful, for, its, bioleaching, property, it, helps, to, break, down, minerals, in, the, waste, water, created, by, the, mine, by, breaking, down, the, minerals, thiobacillus, ferrooxidans, start, to, help, neutralize, the, acidity, of, the, waste, water, this, is, a, way, to, reduce, the, environmental, impact, and, help, remediate, the, damage, caused, by, the, acid, mine, drainage, leaks, psychrophilic, microbes, metabolize, hydrocarbons, which, assists, in, the, remediation, of, hazardous, oil, based, pollutants, in, the, arctic, and, antarctic, regions, these, specific, microbes, are, used, in, this, region, due, to, their, ability, to, perform, their, functions, at, extremely, cold, temperatures, any, bacteria, capable, of, inhabiting, radioactive, mediums, can, be, classified, as, an, extremophile, radioresistant, organisms, are, therefore, critical, in, the, bioremediation, of, radionuclides, uranium, is, particularly, challenging, to, contain, when, released, into, an, environment, and, very, harmful, to, both, human, and, ecosystem, health, the, nanobinders, project, is, equipping, bacteria, that, can, survive, in, uranium, rich, environments, with, gene, sequences, that, enable, proteins, to, bind, to, uranium, in, mining, effluent, making, it, more, convenient, to, collect, and, dispose, of, some, examples, are, shewanella, putrefaciens, geobacter, metallireducens, and, some, strains, of, burkholderia, fungorum, radiotrophic, fungi, which, use, radiation, as, an, energy, source, have, been, found, inside, and, around, the, chernobyl, nuclear, power, plant, radioresistance, has, also, been, observed, in, certain, species, of, macroscopic, lifeforms, the, lethal, dose, required, to, kill, up, to, 50, of, a, tortoise, population, is, 40, 000, roentgens, compared, to, only, 800, roentgens, needed, to, kill, 50, of, a, human, population, in, experiments, exposing, lepidopteran, insects, to, gamma, radiation, significant, dna, damage, was, detected, only, at, 20, gy, and, higher, doses, in, contrast, with, human, cells, that, showed, similar, damage, at, only, 2, gy, new, sub, types, of, extremophiles, are, identified, frequently, and, the, sub, category, list, for, extremophiles, is, always, growing, for, example, microbial, life, lives, in, the, liquid, asphalt, lake, pitch, lake, research, indicates, that, extremophiles, inhabit, the, asphalt, lake, in, populations, ranging, between, 10, 6, and, 10, 7, cells, gram, likewise, until, recently, boron, tolerance, was, unknown, but, a, strong, borophile, was, discovered, in, bacteria, with, the, recent, isolation, of, bacillus, boroniphilus, borophiles, came, into, discussion, studying, these, borophiles, may, help, illuminate, the, mechanisms, of, both, boron, toxicity, and, boron, deficiency, in, july, 2019, a, scientific, study, of, kidd, mine, in, canada, discovered, sulfur, breathing, organisms, which, live, 7, 900, feet, 2, 400, m, below, the, surface, and, which, breathe, sulfur, in, order, to, survive, these, organisms, are, also, remarkable, due, to, eating, rocks, such, as, pyrite, as, their, regular, food, source, the, thermoalkaliphilic, catalase, which, initiates, the, breakdown, of, hydrogen, peroxide, into, oxygen, and, water, was, isolated, from, an, organism, thermus, brockianus, found, in, yellowstone, national, park, by, idaho, national, laboratory, researchers, the, catalase, operates, over, a, temperature, range, from, 30, c, to, over, 94, c, and, a, ph, range, from, 6, 10, this, catalase, is, extremely, stable, compared, to, other, catalases, at, high, temperatures, and, ph, in, a, comparative, study, the, t, brockianus, catalase, exhibited, a, half, life, of, 15, days, at, 80, c, and, ph, 10, while, a, catalase, derived, from, aspergillus, niger, had, a, half, life, of, 15, seconds, under, the, same, conditions, the, catalase, will, have, applications, for, removal, of, hydrogen, peroxide, in, industrial, processes, such, as, pulp, and, paper, bleaching, textile, bleaching, food, pasteurization, and, surface, decontamination, of, food, packaging, dna, modifying, enzymes, such, as, taq, dna, polymerase, and, some, bacillus, enzymes, used, in, clinical, diagnostics, and, starch, liquefaction, are, produced, commercially, by, several, biotechnology, companies, over, 65, prokaryotic, species, are, known, to, be, naturally, competent, for, genetic, transformation, the, ability, to, transfer, dna, from, one, cell, to, another, cell, followed, by, integration, of, the, donor, dna, into, the, recipient, cell, s, chromosome, several, extremophiles, are, able, to, carry, out, species, specific, dna, transfer, as, described, below, however, it, is, not, yet, clear, how, common, such, a, capability, is, among, extremophiles, the, bacterium, deinococcus, radiodurans, is, one, of, the, most, radioresistant, organisms, known, this, bacterium, can, also, survive, cold, dehydration, vacuum, and, acid, and, is, thus, known, as, a, polyextremophile, d, radiodurans, is, competent, to, perform, genetic, transformation, recipient, cells, are, able, to, repair, dna, damage, in, donor, transforming, dna, that, had, been, uv, irradiated, as, efficiently, as, they, repair, cellular, dna, when, the, cells, themselves, are, irradiated, the, extreme, thermophilic, bacterium, thermus, thermophilus, and, other, related, thermus, species, are, also, capable, of, genetic, transformation, halobacterium, volcanii, an, extreme, halophilic, saline, tolerant, archaeon, is, capable, of, natural, genetic, transformation, cytoplasmic, bridges, are, formed, between, cells, that, appear, to, be, used, for, dna, transfer, from, one, cell, to, another, in, either, direction, sulfolobus, solfataricus, and, sulfolobus, acidocaldarius, are, hyperthermophilic, archaea, exposure, of, these, organisms, to, the, dna, damaging, agents, uv, irradiation, bleomycin, or, mitomycin, c, induces, species, specific, cellular, aggregation, uv, induced, cellular, aggregation, of, s, acidocaldarius, mediates, chromosomal, marker, exchange, with, high, frequency, recombination, rates, exceed, those, of, uninduced, cultures, by, up, to, three, orders, of, magnitude, frols, et, al, and, ajon, et, al, hypothesized, that, cellular, aggregation, enhances, species, specific, dna, transfer, between, sulfolobus, cells, in, order, to, repair, damaged, dna, by, means, of, homologous, recombination, van, wolferen, et, al, noted, that, this, dna, exchange, process, may, be, crucial, under, dna, damaging, conditions, such, as, high, temperatures, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, dna, transfer, in, sulfolobus, may, be, an, early, form, of, sexual, interaction, similar, to, the, more, well, studied, bacterial, transformation, systems, that, involve, species, specific, dna, transfer, leading, to, homologous, recombinational, repair, of, dna, damage, and, see, transformation, genetics, extracellular, membrane, vesicles, mvs, might, be, involved, in, dna, transfer, between, different, hyperthermophilic, archaeal, species, it, has, been, shown, that, both, plasmids, and, viral, genomes, can, be, transferred, via, mvs, notably, a, horizontal, plasmid, transfer, has, been, documented, between, hyperthermophilic, thermococcus, and, methanocaldococcus, species, respectively, belonging, to, the, orders, thermococcales, and, methanococcales
