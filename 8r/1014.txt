see, text, platanus, p, l, t, n, s, plat, n, ss, is, a, genus, consisting, of, a, small, number, of, tree, species, native, to, the, northern, hemisphere, they, are, the, sole, living, members, of, the, family, platanaceae, all, mature, members, of, platanus, are, tall, reaching, 30, 50, m, 98, 164, ft, in, height, the, type, species, of, the, genus, is, the, oriental, plane, platanus, orientalis, all, except, for, p, kerrii, are, deciduous, and, most, are, found, in, riparian, or, other, wetland, habitats, in, the, wild, though, proving, drought, tolerant, in, cultivation, the, hybrid, london, plane, platanus, hispanica, has, proved, particularly, tolerant, of, urban, conditions, and, has, been, widely, planted, in, london, and, elsewhere, across, the, temperate, world, they, are, often, known, in, english, as, planes, or, plane, trees, a, formerly, used, name, that, is, now, rare, is, plantain, tree, not, to, be, confused, with, other, unrelated, species, with, the, name, some, north, american, species, are, called, sycamores, especially, platanus, occidentalis, although, the, term, is, also, used, for, several, unrelated, species, of, trees, the, genus, name, platanus, comes, from, ancient, greek, which, referred, to, platanus, orientalis, the, flowers, are, reduced, and, are, borne, in, balls, globose, heads, 3, 7, hairy, sepals, may, be, fused, at, the, base, and, the, petals, are, 3, 7, and, are, spatulate, male, and, female, flowers, are, separate, but, borne, on, the, same, plant, monoecious, the, number, of, heads, in, one, cluster, inflorescence, is, indicative, of, the, species, see, table, below, the, male, flower, has, 3, 8, stamens, the, female, has, a, superior, ovary, with, 3, 7, carpels, plane, trees, are, wind, pollinated, male, flower, heads, fall, off, after, shedding, their, pollen, after, being, pollinated, the, female, flowers, become, achenes, that, form, an, aggregate, ball, the, fruit, is, a, multiple, of, achenes, plant, systematics, simpson, m, g, 2006, typically, the, core, of, the, ball, is, 1, cm, in, diameter, and, is, covered, with, a, net, of, mesh, 1, mm, which, can, be, peeled, off, the, ball, is, 2, 5, 4, cm, in, diameter, and, contains, several, hundred, achenes, each, of, which, has, a, single, seed, and, is, conical, with, the, point, attached, downward, to, the, net, at, the, surface, of, the, ball, there, is, also, a, tuft, of, many, thin, stiff, yellow, green, bristle, fibers, attached, to, the, base, of, each, achene, these, bristles, help, in, wind, dispersion, of, the, fruits, as, in, the, dandelion, the, leaves, are, simple, and, alternate, in, the, subgenus, platanus, they, have, a, palmate, outline, the, base, of, the, leaf, stalk, petiole, is, enlarged, and, completely, wraps, around, the, young, stem, bud, in, its, axil, the, axillary, bud, is, exposed, only, after, the, leaf, falls, off, the, mature, bark, peels, off, or, exfoliates, easily, in, irregularly, shaped, patches, producing, a, mottled, scaly, appearance, on, old, trunks, bark, may, not, flake, off, but, thickens, and, cracks, instead, there, are, two, subgenera, subgenus, castaneophyllum, containing, the, anomalous, p, kerrii, and, subgenus, platanus, with, all, the, others, recent, studies, in, mexico, have, increased, the, number, of, accepted, species, in, this, subgenus, within, subgenus, platanus, evidence, from, both, chloroplast, and, nuclear, gene, sequences, suggests, that, the, p, racemosa, species, complex, in, western, north, america, including, p, racemosa, p, gentryi, p, wrightii, is, more, closely, related, to, the, eurasian, p, orientalis, than, it, is, to, the, other, north, american, species, p, mexicana, sensu, lato, including, up, to, four, species, p, chiapaensis, p, lindeniana, p, mexicana, sensu, stricto, p, oaxacana, p, occidentalis, s, l, with, two, species, p, occidentalis, p, palmeri, p, rzedowskii, the, two, groups, form, genetically, and, morphologically, distinct, evolutionary, lineages, sister, clades, informally, called, the, ana, clade, atlantic, north, american, lineage, and, pna, e, clade, pacific, north, american, european, lineage, both, lineages, have, been, affected, by, reticulate, evolutionary, processes, in, the, past, ancient, or, recent, hybridization, and, introgression, the, genus, platanus, exemplarily, illustrates, the, concept, of, a, coral, of, life, a, species, network, its, modern, day, species, are, not, only, the, product, of, evolutionary, dichotomies, cladogenesis, the, splitting, of, an, ancestral, lineage, into, two, tree, of, life, metaphor, but, also, evolutionary, anastomoses, hybridization, and, introgression, the, fossil, record, of, leaves, and, fruit, identifiable, to, platanus, begins, in, the, paleocene, despite, the, geographic, separation, between, north, america, and, old, world, species, from, these, continents, will, cross, readily, resulting, in, fertile, hybrids, such, as, the, london, plane, which, is, an, anthropogenic, hybrid, cultivar, between, the, north, american, p, occidentalis, sensu, stricto, ana, clade, and, the, mediterranean, p, orientalis, pna, e, clade, widely, used, as, a, park, tree, across, the, northern, hemisphere, it, frequently, backcrosses, with, both, its, parents, the, following, are, named,

probably, coevolved, while, the, old, world, species, are, highly, sensitive, other, diseases, such, as, powdery, mildew, occur, frequently, but, are, of, lesser, importance, platanus, species, are, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, species, including, phyllonorycter, platani, and, setaceous, hebrew, character, in, the, 21st, century, a, disease, commonly, known, as, massaria, disease, has, attacked, plane, trees, across, europe, it, is, caused, by, the, fungus, splanchnonema, platani, and, causes, large, lesions, on, the, upper, sides, of, branches, there, have, been, cases, of, platanus, cough, symptoms, of, shortness, of, breath, coughing, and, irritated, eyes, which, may, affect, several, people, in, a, place, and, have, led, to, initial, suspicion, of, an, attack, with, an, irritant, gas, after, one, such, mass, attack, which, affected, schoolchildren, in, classrooms, with, open, windows, densely, surrounded, by, plane, tees, children, had, to, be, admitted, to, hospital, where, they, were, treated, and, recovered, without, ill, effects, it, was, found, that, the, symptoms, were, due, to, the, fine, star, shaped, trichomes, hairs, on, all, parts, of, platanus, trees, which, are, broken, off, by, strong, wind, after, a, prolonged, dry, period, the, dust, created, causes, direct, irritation, and, scratchiness, in, the, eyes, throat, and, nose, but, not, the, runny, nose, and, itching, eyes, and, nose, caused, by, an, allergy, the, school, incident, took, place, after, a, dry, period, with, a, fairly, high, temperature, of, 29, c, and, wind, gusting, at, 50, km, h, protection, against, platanus, cough, is, provided, by, avoiding, contact, and, wearing, protective, glasses, and, masks, under, weather, conditions, promoting, release, of, trichomes, when, cleaning, in, an, urban, environment, sweeping, up, fallen, leaves, and, branches, can, release, hairs, cleaning, by, suction, is, preferred, it, is, not, recommended, that, trees, in, cities, be, felled, as, they, are, beneficial, in, particular, the, platanus, trichomes, act, as, biofilters, for, air, pollutants, where, there, are, urban, concentrations, presenting, a, risk, seasonal, spraying, of, trees, with, a, solution, of, apple, pectin, can, prevent, the, star, hair, from, breaking, off, the, principal, use, of, these, trees, is, as, ornamental, trees, especially, in, urban, areas, and, by, roadsides, the, london, plane, is, particularly, popular, for, this, purpose, the, american, plane, is, cultivated, sometimes, for, timber, and, investigations, have, been, made, into, its, use, as, a, biomass, crop, the, oriental, plane, is, widely, used, as, an, ornamental, tree, and, also, has, a, number, of, minor, medicinal, uses, most, significant, aspects, of, cultural, history, apply, to, platanus, orientalis, in, the, old, world, the, tree, is, an, important, part, of, the, literary, scenery, of, plato, s, dialogue, phaedrus, because, of, plato, the, tree, also, played, an, important, role, in, the, scenery, of, cicero, s, de, oratore, the, trees, also, provided, the, shade, under, which, aristotle, and, plato, s, famed, philosophical, schools, were, held, handel, s, opera, serse, has, a, famous, aria, ombra, mai, fu, which, the, title, character, sings, in, praise, of, his, favorite, plane, tree, the, plane, tree, has, been, a, frequent, motif, featured, in, classical, chinese, poetry, as, an, embodiment, of, sorrowful, sentiments, due, to, its, autumnal, shedding, of, leaves, the, legendary, dry, tree, first, recorded, by, marco, polo, was, possibly, a, platanus, according, to, the, legend, it, marked, the, site, of, the, battle, between, alexander, the, great, and, darius, iii, the, german, camouflage, pattern, platanenmuster, plane, tree, pattern, designed, in, 1937, 1942, by, johann, georg, otto, schick, was, the, first, dotted, camouflage, pattern
