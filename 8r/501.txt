poecilioides, reticulatus, w, peters, 1859, the, guppy, poecilia, reticulata, also, known, as, millionfish, or, the, rainbow, fish, is, one, of, the, world, s, most, widely, distributed, tropical, fish, and, one, of, the, most, popular, freshwater, aquarium, fish, species, it, is, a, member, of, the, family, poeciliidae, and, like, almost, all, american, members, of, the, family, is, live, bearing, guppies, originate, from, northeast, south, america, but, have, been, introduced, to, many, environments, and, are, now, found, all, over, the, world, they, are, highly, adaptable, and, thrive, in, many, different, environmental, and, ecological, conditions, male, guppies, which, are, smaller, than, females, have, ornamental, caudal, and, dorsal, fins, wild, guppies, generally, feed, on, a, variety, of, food, sources, including, benthic, algae, and, aquatic, insect, larvae, guppies, are, used, as, a, model, organism, in, the, fields, of, ecology, evolution, and, behavioural, studies, guppies, were, first, described, in, venezuela, as, poecilia, reticulata, by, wilhelm, peters, in, 1859, and, as, lebistes, poecilioides, in, barbados, by, de, filippi, in, 1861, it, was, named, girardinus, guppii, by, albert, g, nther, in, honor, of, robert, john, lechmere, guppy, who, sent, specimens, of, the, species, from, trinidad, to, the, natural, history, museum, in, london, it, was, reclassified, as, lebistes, reticulatus, by, regan, in, 1913, then, in, 1963, rosen, and, bailey, brought, it, back, to, its, original, name, poecilia, reticulata, while, the, taxonomy, of, the, species, was, frequently, changed, and, resulted, in, many, synonyms, guppy, remains, the, common, name, even, as, girardinus, guppii, is, now, considered, a, junior, synonym, of, poecilia, reticulata, guppies, are, native, to, antigua, and, barbuda, barbados, brazil, guyana, trinidad, and, tobago, and, venezuela, however, guppies, have, been, introduced, to, many, different, countries, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, sometimes, this, has, occurred, accidentally, but, most, often, as, a, means, of, mosquito, control, the, guppies, were, expected, to, eat, the, mosquito, larvae, and, help, slow, the, spread, of, malaria, but, in, many, cases, these, guppies, have, had, a, negative, impact, on, native, fish, populations, field, studies, reveal, that, guppies, have, colonized, almost, every, freshwater, body, accessible, to, them, in, their, natural, ranges, especially, in, the, streams, located, near, the, coastal, fringes, of, mainland, south, america, although, not, typically, found, there, guppies, also, have, tolerance, to, brackish, water, and, have, colonized, some, brackish, environments, they, tend, to, be, more, abundant, in, smaller, streams, and, pools, than, in, large, deep, or, fast, flowing, rivers, they, also, are, capable, of, being, acclimated, to, full, saltwater, like, their, molly, cousins, guppies, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, while, wild, type, females, are, grey, in, body, colour, males, have, splashes, spots, or, stripes, that, can, be, any, of, a, wide, variety, of, colors, the, development, and, exhibiting, of, color, patterns, in, male, guppies, is, usually, due, to, the, amount, of, thyroid, hormone, that, they, contain, the, thyroid, hormones, not, only, influence, color, pattern, but, control, endocrine, function, in, response, to, their, environment, the, size, of, guppies, vary, but, males, are, typically, 1, 5, 4, cm, 0, 6, 1, 6, in, long, while, females, are, 3, 7, cm, 1, 2, 2, 8, in, long, a, variety, of, fancy, guppy, strains, are, produced, by, breeders, through, selective, breeding, characterized, by, different, colours, patterns, shapes, and, sizes, of, fins, such, as, snakeskin, and, grass, varieties, many, domestic, strains, have, morphological, traits, that, are, very, distinct, from, the, wild, type, antecedents, males, and, females, of, many, domestic, strains, usually, have, larger, body, size, and, are, much, more, lavishly, ornamented, than, their, wild, type, antecedents, guppies, have, 23, pairs, of, chromosomes, including, one, pair, of, sex, chromosomes, the, same, number, as, humans, the, genes, responsible, for, male, guppies, ornamentations, are, y, chromosome, linked, and, are, heritable, two, generations, of, guppies, per, year, occur, in, the, wild, guppies, are, well, developed, and, capable, of, independent, existence, without, further, parental, care, by, the, time, they, are, born, young, guppies, school, together, and, perform, anti, predator, tactics, brood, size, is, extremely, variable, yet, some, consistent, differences, exist, among, populations, depending, on, the, predation, level, and, other, factors, females, of, matching, body, sizes, tend, to, produce, more, numerous, but, smaller, sized, offspring, in, high, predation, conditions, female, guppies, first, produce, offspring, at, 10, 20, weeks, of, age, and, they, continue, to, reproduce, until, 20, 34, months, of, age, male, guppies, mature, in, 7, weeks, or, less, total, lifespan, of, guppies, in, the, wild, varies, greatly, but, it, is, typically, around, 2, years, variations, in, such, life, historic, characteristics, of, guppies, are, observed, in, different, populations, indicating, that, different, evolutionary, pressures, exist, guppies, body, sizes, are, positively, correlated, with, age, and, their, size, at, maturation, varies, highly, depending, on, the, predation, risk, of, the, occupied, environments, male, and, female, guppies, from, high, predation, regions, mature, faster, and, start, reproducing, earlier, and, they, devote, more, resources, to, reproduction, than, those, from, low, predation, regions, females, from, high, predation, regions, reproduce, more, frequently, and, produce, more, offspring, per, litter, indicating, that, they, are, more, fecund, than, low, predation, females, female, guppies, reproductive, success, is, also, related, to, age, older, females, produce, offspring, with, reduced, size, and, at, increased, interbrood, intervals, one, major, factor, that, affects, wild, guppies, senescence, patterns, is, the, mortality, rate, caused, by, predation, guppies, from, high, predation, environments, suffer, high, extrinsic, mortality, rate, because, they, are, more, likely, to, be, killed, by, predators, female, guppies, from, high, predation, environments, experience, a, significant, increase, in, mortality, at, 6, months, of, age, while, those, from, low, predation, environments, do, not, suffer, increased, mortality, until, 16, months, however, guppies, from, high, predation, environments, were, found, to, have, longer, lifespans, because, their, reproductive, lifespans, are, longer, no, significant, difference, is, seen, in, postreproductive, lifespans, in, addition, to, senescence, pattern, resource, availability, and, density, also, matter, in, regulation, of, guppy, populations, guppies, reduce, their, fecundity, and, reproductive, allocation, in, response, to, scarce, food, when, food, is, abundant, they, increase, brood, size, differential, reproductive, allocation, can, be, the, cause, of, seasonality, of, life, history, characteristics, in, some, guppy, populations, for, example, during, the, wet, season, from, may, to, december, guppies, in, the, northern, range, of, trinidad, reduce, their, investment, in, reproduction, regardless, of, predation, level, possibly, in, response, to, decreased, food, resources, population, density, also, matters, in, simpler, environments, because, higher, intraspecific, competition, causes, a, decrease, in, reproductive, rate, and, somatic, growth, rate, and, a, corresponding, increase, in, juvenile, mortality, rate, due, to, cannibalism, it, was, confirmed, that, in, low, predation, environments, guppy, populations, are, in, part, regulated, by, density, guppies, have, the, mating, system, called, polyandry, where, females, mate, with, multiple, males, multiple, mating, is, beneficial, for, males, because, the, males, reproductive, success, is, directly, related, to, how, many, times, they, mate, the, cost, of, multiple, mating, for, males, is, very, low, because, they, do, not, provide, material, benefit, to, the, females, or, parental, care, to, the, offspring, conversely, multiple, mating, can, be, disadvantageous, for, females, because, it, reduces, foraging, efficiency, and, increases, the, chances, of, predation, and, parasitic, infection, however, females, gain, some, potential, benefits, from, multiple, mating, for, example, females, that, mate, multiple, times, are, found, to, be, able, to, produce, more, offspring, in, shorter, gestation, time, and, their, offspring, tend, to, have, better, qualities, such, as, enhanced, schooling, and, predator, evasion, abilities, female, guppies, mate, again, more, actively, and, delay, the, development, of, a, brood, when, the, anticipated, second, mate, is, more, attractive, than, the, first, male, experiments, show, that, remating, females, prefer, a, novel, male, to, the, original, male, or, a, brother, of, the, original, male, with, similar, phenotypes, females, preference, for, novel, males, in, remating, can, explain, the, excessive, phenotypic, polymorphism, in, male, guppies, inbreeding, ordinarily, has, negative, fitness, consequences, inbreeding, depression, and, as, a, result, species, have, evolved, mechanisms, to, avoid, inbreeding, inbreeding, depression, is, considered, to, be, due, largely, to, the, expression, of, homozygous, deleterious, recessive, mutations, numerous, inbreeding, avoidance, mechanisms, operating, prior, to, mating, have, been, described, however, inbreeding, avoidance, mechanisms, that, operate, subsequent, to, copulation, are, less, well, known, in, guppies, a, post, copulatory, mechanism, of, inbreeding, avoidance, occurs, based, on, competition, between, sperm, of, rival, males, for, achieving, fertilization, in, competitions, between, sperm, from, an, unrelated, male, and, from, a, full, sibling, male, a, significant, bias, in, paternity, towards, the, unrelated, male, was, observed, female, guppy, choice, plays, an, important, role, in, multiple, mating, female, guppies, are, attracted, to, brightly, colored, males, especially, ones, with, orange, spots, on, the, flank, orange, spots, can, serve, as, an, indicator, of, better, physical, fitness, as, orange, spotted, males, are, observed, to, swim, longer, in, a, strong, current, there, is, also, the, concept, of, color, association, to, possibly, explain, mate, choice, since, one, of, the, food, sources, wild, guppies, compete, vigorously, for, is, the, fruit, of, cabrehash, trees, sloanea, laurifolia, an, orange, carotenoid, containing, fruit, the, orange, coloration, that, female, guppies, select, for, in, males, is, composed, of, carotenoids, the, saturation, of, which, is, affected, by, the, male, s, carotenoid, ingestion, and, parasite, load, guppies, cannot, synthesize, these, pigments, by, themselves, and, must, obtain, them, through, their, diet, because, of, this, connection, females, are, possibly, selecting, for, healthy, males, with, superior, foraging, abilities, by, choosing, mates, with, bright, orange, carotinoid, pigments, thus, increasing, the, survival, chance, of, her, offspring, due, to, the, advantage, in, mating, male, guppies, evolve, to, have, more, ornamentation, across, generations, in, low, predation, environments, where, the, cost, of, being, conspicuous, is, lower, the, rate, and, duration, of, courtship, display, of, male, guppies, also, play, an, important, role, in, female, guppies, mating, choice, courtship, behavior, is, another, indicator, of, fitness, due, to, the, physical, strength, involved, in, maintaining, the, courtship, dance, called, sigmoid, display, in, which, the, males, flex, their, bodies, into, an, s, shape, and, vibrate, rapidly, female, mating, choice, may, also, be, influenced, by, another, female, s, choice, in, an, experiment, female, guppies, watched, two, males, one, solitary, and, the, other, actively, courting, another, female, and, were, given, a, choice, between, the, two, most, females, spent, a, longer, time, next, to, the, male, that, was, courting, female, guppies, preference, for, fit, males, allows, their, descendants, to, inherit, better, physical, fitness, and, better, chance, of, survival, guppies, have, many, predators, such, as, larger, fish, and, birds, in, their, native, range, some, of, their, common, predators, in, the, wild, are, crenicichla, alta, anablepsoides, hartii, and, aequidens, pulcher, guppies, small, bodies, and, the, bright, coloration, of, males, make, them, easy, prey, and, like, many, fish, they, often, school, together, to, avoid, predation, schooling, is, more, favored, by, evolution, in, populations, of, guppies, under, high, predation, pressure, exerted, either, by, predator, type, or, predator, density, male, guppies, rely, on, schooling, in, particular, the, behavioral, responses, of, females, to, make, antipredator, decisions, coloration, of, guppies, also, evolves, differentially, in, response, to, predation, male, guppies, that, are, brighter, in, color, have, an, advantage, in, mating, as, they, attract, more, females, in, general, but, they, have, a, higher, risk, of, being, noticed, by, predators, than, duller, males, male, guppies, evolve, to, be, more, dull, in, color, and, have, fewer, smaller, spots, under, intense, predation, both, in, wild, and, in, laboratory, settings, female, guppies, in, a, high, predation, environment, also, evolve, to, prefer, brightly, colored, males, less, often, rejecting, them, when, guppies, encounter, a, potential, predator, some, of, them, approach, the, predator, to, assess, danger, this, behavior, called, predator, inspection, benefits, the, inspector, since, it, gains, information, but, puts, the, inspector, at, a, risk, of, predation, to, reduce, the, risk, inspectors, avoid, the, predator, s, mouth, area, called, the, attack, cone, and, approach, the, predator, from, the, side, or, back, they, may, also, form, a, group, for, protection, the, size, of, which, is, larger, in, high, predation, populations, although, evidence, indicates, predators, are, less, likely, to, attack, an, inspector, than, a, non, inspector, the, inspectors, remain, at, higher, risk, due, to, proximity, to, the, predator, risk, taking, behaviors, such, as, predator, inspection, can, be, evolutionarily, stable, only, when, a, mechanism, prevents, selfish, individuals, from, taking, advantage, of, altruistic, individuals, guppies, may, adopt, a, conditional, approach, strategy, that, resembles, tit, for, tat, according, to, this, hypothesis, guppies, would, inspect, the, predator, on, the, first, move, but, if, their, co, inspectors, do, not, participate, in, the, predator, inspection, visits, or, do, not, approach, the, predator, close, enough, they, can, retaliate, by, copying, the, defector, s, last, move, in, the, next, predator, inspection, visit, the, hypothesis, was, supported, in, laboratory, experiments, when, guppies, detect, a, predator, their, irises, rapidly, darken, from, silver, to, jet, black, which, draws, predators, to, attack, the, guppies, head, instead, of, their, body, s, center, of, mass, perhaps, counterintuitively, this, predator, divertive, behavior, allows, guppies, to, rapidly, pivot, out, of, the, way, as, predators, lunge, where, the, guppies, head, was, this, matador, like, anti, predator, behavior, was, first, described, in, guppies, but, may, be, found, in, other, animal, species, with, bright, attention, grabbing, coloration, located, on, vital, organs, such, as, epaulette, sharks, guppies, are, also, host, to, a, range, of, parasites, and, one, of, these, gyrodactylus, turnbulli, has, been, used, as, a, model, system, for, studying, host, parasite, interactions, recent, work, on, this, has, shown, that, the, interaction, between, exposure, to, chronic, anthropogenic, noise, and, g, turnbulli, can, decrease, guppy, survival, while, a, short, burst, of, underwater, noise, has, positive, effects, on, parasite, densities, on, the, host, most, likely, resulting, in, negative, fitness, effects, for, guppies, wild, guppies, feed, on, algal, remains, diatoms, invertebrates, zooplankton, detritus, plant, fragments, mineral, particles, aquatic, insect, larvae, and, other, sources, algal, remains, constitute, the, biggest, proportion, of, wild, guppy, diet, in, most, cases, but, diets, vary, depending, on, the, specific, conditions, of, food, availability, in, the, habitat, for, example, a, study, on, wild, trinidad, guppies, showed, that, guppies, collected, from, an, oligotrophic, upstream, region, upper, aripo, river, mainly, consumed, invertebrates, while, guppies, from, a, eutrophic, downstream, region, lower, tacarigua, river, consumed, mostly, diatoms, and, mineral, particles, algae, are, less, nutritious, than, invertebrates, and, the, guppies, that, feed, mainly, on, algae, have, poor, diets, guppies, have, also, been, observed, eating, native, fishes, eggs, occasionally, expressing, cannibalism, also, eating, its, own, young, when, kept, in, laboratory, conditions, guppies, diet, preference, is, not, simply, correlated, to, the, abundance, of, a, particular, food, laboratory, experiments, confirmed, that, guppies, show, diet, switching, behavior, in, which, they, feed, disproportionately, on, the, more, abundant, food, when, they, are, offered, two, food, choices, the, result, shows, that, different, groups, of, guppies, have, weak, and, variable, food, preference, diet, preference, in, guppies, could, be, related, to, factors, such, as, the, presence, of, competitors, for, example, the, lower, tacarigua, river, has, a, larger, variety, of, species, and, competition, for, invertebrate, prey, is, higher, therefore, the, proportion, of, invertebrates, is, small, in, the, diets, of, those, guppies, guppies, often, forage, in, groups, because, they, can, find, food, more, easily, shoaling, guppies, spend, less, time, and, energy, on, antipredatory, behavior, than, solitary, ones, and, spend, more, time, on, feeding, however, such, behavior, results, in, food, that, is, found, being, shared, with, other, members, of, the, group, studies, also, show, when, an, evolutionary, cost, exists, guppies, that, tend, to, shoal, are, less, aggressive, and, less, competitive, with, regards, to, scarce, resources, therefore, shoaling, is, preferred, in, high, predation, regions, but, not, in, low, predation, regions, when, guppies, with, a, high, tendency, to, shoal, were, isolated, from, high, predation, regions, and, were, relocated, to, predator, free, environments, over, time, they, decreased, their, shoaling, behavior, supporting, the, hypothesis, that, shoaling, is, less, preferred, in, low, predation, environments, guppies, are, highly, prolific, livebearers, the, gestation, period, of, guppies, varies, considerably, ranging, from, 20, to, 60, days, at, 25, to, 27, c, and, depending, on, several, environmental, factors, reproduction, typically, continues, through, the, year, and, the, female, becomes, ready, for, conception, again, quickly, after, parturition, male, guppies, like, other, members, of, the, family, poeciliidae, possess, a, modified, tubular, anal, fin, called, the, gonopodium, located, directly, behind, the, ventral, fin, the, gonopodium, has, a, channel, like, structure, through, which, bundles, of, spermatozoa, called, spermatozeugmata, are, transferred, to, females, in, courted, mating, where, the, female, shows, receptive, behavior, following, the, male, s, courtship, display, the, male, briefly, inserts, the, gonopodium, into, the, female, s, genital, pore, for, internal, fertilization, however, in, the, case, of, sneaky, mating, where, copulation, is, forced, the, male, approaches, the, female, and, thrusts, the, gonopodium, at, the, female, s, urogenital, pore, once, inseminated, female, guppies, can, store, sperm, in, their, ovaries, and, gonoducts, which, can, continue, to, fertilize, ova, up, to, eight, months, because, of, the, sperm, storage, mechanism, males, are, capable, of, posthumous, reproduction, meaning, the, female, mate, can, give, birth, to, the, male, s, offspring, long, after, the, male, s, death, which, contributes, significantly, to, the, reproductive, dynamics, of, the, wild, guppy, populations, the, guppy, has, been, successfully, hybridised, with, various, species, of, molly, poecilia, latipinna, or, p, velifera, e, g, male, guppy, and, female, molly, however, the, hybrids, are, always, male, and, appear, to, be, infertile, the, guppy, has, also, been, hybridised, with, the, endler, s, livebearer, poecilia, wingei, to, produce, fertile, offspring, with, the, suggestion, that, despite, physical, and, behavioural, differences, endler, s, may, represent, a, subspecies, of, poecilia, reticulata, rather, than, a, distinct, species, due, to, the, extensive, selective, breeding, of, guppies, for, desirable, traits, such, as, greater, size, and, colour, some, strains, of, the, fish, have, become, less, hardy, than, their, wild, counterparts, immense, inbreeding, of, guppies, has, been, found, to, affect, body, size, fertility, and, susceptibility, to, diseases, guppies, prefer, a, hard, water, aquarium, with, a, temperature, between, 25, 5, and, 27, 8, c, 78, and, 82, f, and, salt, levels, equivalent, to, one, tablespoon, per, 19, l, 5, us, gal, they, can, withstand, levels, of, salinity, up, to, 150, that, of, normal, seawater, which, has, led, to, them, being, occasionally, included, in, marine, tropical, community, tanks, as, well, as, in, freshwater, tropical, tanks, guppies, are, generally, peaceful, though, nipping, behaviour, is, sometimes, exhibited, between, male, guppies, or, towards, other, top, swimmers, like, members, of, the, genus, xiphophorus, platies, and, swordtails, and, occasionally, other, fish, with, prominent, fins, such, as, angelfish, guppies, should, not, be, kept, as, a, single, fish, in, an, aquarium, because, both, males, and, females, show, signs, of, shoaling, and, are, usually, found, in, large, groups, in, the, wild, its, most, famous, characteristic, is, its, propensity, for, breeding, and, it, can, breed, in, both, freshwater, and, marine, aquaria, guppies, prefer, water, temperatures, around, 22, 2, 26, 1, c, 72, 79, f, for, reproduction, pregnant, female, guppies, have, enlarged, and, darkened, gravid, spots, near, their, anal, vents, just, before, birth, the, eyes, of, fry, may, be, seen, through, the, translucent, skin, in, this, area, of, the, female, s, body, when, birth, occurs, individual, offspring, are, dropped, in, sequence, typically, over, a, period, of, one, to, six, hours, the, female, guppy, has, drops, of, two, to, 200, fry, at, a, time, though, typically, ranging, between, 30, and, 60, well, fed, adults, do, not, often, eat, their, own, young, although, sometimes, safe, zones, are, required, for, the, fry, specially, designed, livebearer, birthing, tanks, which, can, be, suspended, inside, the, aquarium, are, available, from, aquatic, retailers, these, also, serve, to, shield, the, pregnant, female, from, further, attention, from, the, males, which, is, important, because, the, males, sometimes, attack, the, females, while, they, are, giving, birth, it, also, provides, a, separate, area, for, the, newborn, young, as, protection, from, being, eaten, by, their, mother, however, if, a, female, is, put, in, the, breeder, box, too, early, it, may, cause, her, to, have, a, miscarriage, well, planted, tanks, that, offer, barriers, to, adult, guppies, shelter, the, young, quite, well, guppy, grass, water, sprite, water, wisteria, duckweed, water, lettuce, and, java, moss,

roughly, three, or, four, months, to, reach, maturity, feeding, fry, live, foods, such, as, baby, brine, shrimp, microworms, infusoria, and, vinegar, eels, is, recommended, alternatives, include, finely, ground, flake, food, egg, yolk, and, liquid, fish, food, though, the, particulates, in, these, may, be, too, large, for, the, youngest, fry, to, eat, guppies, are, susceptible, to, various, diseases, which, may, stem, from, bacterial, parasitic, or, fungal, infections, maintaining, a, clean, tank, a, balanced, diet, and, regular, monitoring, can, help, in, preventing, these, diseases, ichthyophthirius, multifiliis, commonly, known, as, ich, is, a, protozoan, parasite, that, infects, guppies, and, other, freshwater, fish, the, infection, is, characterized, by, white, cysts, appearing, on, the, skin, gills, and, fins, of, the, affected, fish, giving, a, distinct, white, spot, appearance, which, is, often, referred, to, as, white, spot, disease, the, life, cycle, of, ichthyophthirius, multifiliis, involves, three, stages, the, trophont, stage, the, tomont, stage, and, the, theront, stage, fin, rot, is, primarily, caused, by, bacterial, infections, although, fungal, infections, can, also, be, a, culprit, the, condition, manifests, through, the, progressive, decay, or, fraying, of, the, fins, often, accompanied, by, discoloration, usually, turning, the, edges, of, the, fins, white, black, or, red, the, primary, causative, agents, of, fin, rot, are, gram, negative, bacteria, such, as, pseudomonas, fluorescens, and, aeromonas, hydrophila, poor, water, quality, overcrowding, and, stress, are, significant, contributors, to, the, onset, and, progression, of, the, disease, as, they, create, an, environment, conducive, for, bacterial, growth, and, can, compromise, the, fish, s, immune, system, columnaris, also, known, as, cotton, mouth, disease, or, cotton, wool, disease, is, a, common, bacterial, infection, in, guppies, and, other, freshwater, fish, caused, by, the, bacterium, flavobacterium, columnare, this, bacterium, thrives, in, warm, freshwater, environments, treatment, for, columnaris, should, commence, promptly, to, prevent, severe, mortality, common, treatment, measures, include, improving, water, quality, antibacterial, medications, such, as, kanamycin, erythromycin, or, oxytetracycline, and, in, extreme, cases, antibiotic, injections, velvet, also, known, as, gold, dust, disease, is, a, prevalent, ailment, caused, by, the, dinoflagellate, parasites, of, the, genus, oodinium, when, these, parasites, attach, to, a, fish, s, skin, gills, and, eyes, they, trigger, a, range, of, symptoms, notable, symptoms, include, a, fine, gold, or, rust, colored, dust, appearing, on, the, fish, s, body, clamped, fins, scratching,
