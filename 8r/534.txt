the, hammerhead, sharks, are, a, group, of, sharks, that, form, the, family, sphyrnidae, named, for, the, unusual, and, distinctive, form, of, their, heads, which, are, flattened, and, laterally, extended, into, a, cephalofoil, a, t, shape, or, hammer, the, shark, s, eyes, are, placed, one, on, either, end, of, this, t, shaped, structure, with, their, small, mouths, directly, centered, and, underneath, most, hammerhead, species, are, placed, in, the, genus, sphyrna, while, the, winghead, shark, is, placed, in, its, own, genus, eusphyra, many, different, but, not, necessarily, mutually, exclusive, functions, have, been, postulated, for, the, cephalofoil, including, sensory, reception, manoeuvering, and, prey, manipulation, the, cephalofoil, gives, the, shark, superior, binocular, vision, and, depth, perception, hammerheads, are, found, worldwide, preferring, life, in, warmer, waters, along, coastlines, and, continental, shelves, unlike, most, sharks, some, hammerhead, species, will, congregate, and, swim, in, large, schools, during, the, day, becoming, solitary, hunters, at, night, the, known, species, range, from, 0, 9, to, 6, 0, m, 2, ft, 11, in, to, 19, ft, 8, in, in, length, and, weigh, 3, 580, kg, 6, 6, 1, 300, lb, one, specimen, caught, off, the, florida, coast, in, 1906, weighed, over, 680, kg, 1, 500, lb, they, are, usually, light, gray, and, have, a, greenish, tint, their, bellies, are, white, which, allows, them, to, blend, into, the, background, when, viewed, from, below, and, sneak, up, to, their, prey, their, heads, have, lateral, projections, that, give, them, a, hammer, like, shape, while, overall, similar, this, shape, differs, somewhat, between, species, examples, are, a, distinct, t, shape, in, the, great, hammerhead, a, rounded, head, with, a, central, notch, in, the, scalloped, hammerhead, and, an, unnotched, rounded, head, in, the, smooth, hammerhead, hammerheads, have, disproportionately, small, mouths, compared, to, other, shark, species, some, species, are, also, known, to, form, schools, in, the, evening, like, most, other, sharks, they, become, solitary, hunters, national, geographic, explained, that, hammerheads, can, be, found, in, warm, tropical, waters, but, during, the, summer, they, begin, a, mass, migration, period, in, search, of, colder, waters, since, sharks, do, not, have, mineralized, bones, and, rarely, fossilize, only, their, teeth, are, commonly, found, as, fossils, their, closest, relatives, are, the, requiem, sharks, carcharinidae, based, on, dna, studies, and, fossils, the, ancestor, of, the, hammerheads, probably, lived, in, the, early, miocene, epoch, about, 20, million, years, ago, using, mitochondrial, dna, a, phylogenetic, tree, of, the, hammerhead, sharks, showed, the, winghead, shark, as, sister, to, the, rest, of, the, hammerhead, sharks, as, the, winghead, shark, has, proportionately, the, largest, hammer, of, the, hammerhead, sharks, this, suggests, that, the, first, ancestral, hammerhead, sharks, also, had, large, hammers, the, hammer, like, shape, of, the, head, may, have, evolved, at, least, in, part, to, enhance, the, animal, s, vision, the, positioning, of, the, eyes, mounted, on, the, sides, of, the, shark, s, distinctive, hammer, head, allows, 360, of, vision, in, the, vertical, plane, meaning, the, animals, can, see, above, and, below, them, at, all, times, they, also, have, an, increased, binocular, vision, and, depth, of, visual, field, as, a, result, of, the, cephalofoil, the, shape, of, the, head, was, previously, thought, to, help, the, shark, find, food, aiding, in, close, quarters, maneuverability, and, allowing, sharp, turning, movement, without, losing, stability, the, unusual, structure, of, its, vertebrae, though, has, been, found, to, be, instrumental, in, making, the, turns, correctly, more, often, than, the, shape, of, its, head, though, it, would, also, shift, and, provide, lift, from, what, is, known, about, the, winghead, shark, the, shape, of, the, hammerhead, apparently, has, to, do, with, an, evolved, sensory, function, like, all, sharks, hammerheads, have, electroreceptory, sensory, pores, called, ampullae, of, lorenzini, the, pores, on, the, shark, s, head, lead, to, sensory, tubes, which, detect, electric, fields, generated, by, other, living, creatures, by, distributing, the, receptors, over, a, wider, area, like, a, larger, radio, antenna, hammerheads, can, sweep, for, prey, more, effectively, reproduction, occurs, only, once, a, year, for, hammerhead, sharks, and, usually, occurs, with, the, male, shark, biting, the, female, shark, violently, until, she, agrees, to, mate, with, him, the, hammerhead, sharks, exhibit, a, viviparous, mode, of, reproduction, with, females, giving, birth, to, live, young, like, other, sharks, fertilization, is, internal, with, the, male, transferring, sperm, to, the, female, through, one, of, two, intromittent, organs, called, claspers, the, developing, embryos, are, at, first, sustained, by, a, yolk, sac, when, the, supply, of, yolk, is, exhausted, the, depleted, yolk, sac, transforms, into, a, structure, analogous, to, a, mammalian, placenta, called, a, yolk, sac, placenta, or, pseudoplacenta, through, which, the, mother, delivers, sustenance, until, birth, once, the, baby, sharks, are, born, they, are, not, taken, care, of, by, the, parents, in, any, way, usually, a, litter, consists, of, 12, to, 15, pups, except, for, the, great, hammerhead, which, gives, birth, to, litters, of, 20, to, 40, pups, these, baby, sharks, huddle, together, and, swim, toward, warmer, water, until, they, are, old, enough, and, large, enough, to, survive, on, their, own, in, 2007, the, bonnethead, shark, was, found, to, be, capable, of, asexual, reproduction, via, automictic, parthenogenesis, in, which, a, female, s, ovum, fuses, with, a, polar, body, to, form, a, zygote, without, the, need, for, a, male, this, was, the, first, shark, known, to, do, this, hammerhead, sharks, eat, a, large, range, of, prey, such, as, fish, including, other, sharks, squid, octopus, and, crustaceans, stingrays, are, a, particular, favorite, with, the, positioning, of, their, comparatively, smaller, crescent, shaped, mouths, underneath, their, t, shaped, heads, allowing, for, skilled, skate, ray, and, flounder, hunting, among, other, seafloor, dwellers, these, sharks, will, often, be, found, swimming, above, the, sand, along, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, stalking, their, prey, their, unique, heads, are, further, utilized, as, a, tool, or, weapon, if, hunting, rays, and, flatfishes, the, shark, uses, its, head, to, pin, down, and, briefly, stun, the, prey, and, only, eats, once, their, quarry, is, clearly, weakened, and, in, shock, the, great, hammerhead, tending, to, be, larger, and, more, aggressive, to, its, own, kind, than, other, hammerheads, occasionally, engages, in, cannibalism, eating, other, hammerhead, sharks, including, mothers, consuming, their, own, young, in, addition, to, the, typical, animal, prey, bonnetheads, have, been, found, to, feed, on, seagrass, which, sometimes, makes, up, as, much, as, half, their, stomach, contents, they, may, swallow, it, unintentionally, but, they, are, able, to, partially, digest, it, at, the, time, of, discovery, this, was, the, only, known, case, of, a, potentially, omnivorous, species, of, shark, since, then, whale, sharks, were, also, found, to, be, omnivorous, there, are, nine, distinct, species, of, hammerhead, shark, in, the, wild, according, to, the, international, shark, attack, file, humans, have, been, subjects, of, 17, documented, unprovoked, attacks, by, hammerhead, sharks, within, the, genus, sphyrna, since, ad, 1580, no, human, fatalities, have, been, recorded, most, hammerhead, shark, species, are, too, small, to, inflict, serious, damage, to, humans, the, great, and, the, scalloped, hammerheads, are, listed, on, the, world, conservation, union, s, iucn, 2008, red, list, as, endangered, whereas, the, smalleye, hammerhead, is, listed, as, vulnerable, the, status, given, to, these, sharks, is, as, a, result, of, overfishing, and, demand, for, their, fins, an, expensive, delicacy, among, others, scientists, expressed, their, concern, about, the, plight, of, the, scalloped, hammerhead, at, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, annual, meeting, in, boston, the, young, swim, mostly, in, shallow, waters, along, shores, all, over, the, world, to, avoid, predators, shark, fins, are, prized, as, a, delicacy, in, certain, countries, in, asia, such, as, china, and, overfishing, is, putting, many, hammerhead, sharks, at, risk, of, extinction, fishermen, who, harvest, the, animals, typically, cut, off, the, fins, and, toss, the, remainder, of, the, fish, which, is, often, still, alive, back, into, the, sea, this, practice, known, as, finning, is, lethal, to, the, shark, the, relatively, small, bonnethead, is, regular, at, public, aquariums, as, it, has, proven, easier, to, keep, in, captivity, than, the, larger, hammerhead, species, and, it, has, been, bred, at, a, handful, of, facilities, nevertheless, at, up, to, 1, 5, m, 5, ft, in, length, and, with, highly, specialized, requirements, very, few, private, aquarists, have, the, experience, and, resources, necessary, to, maintain, a, bonnethead, in, captivity, the, larger, hammerhead, species, can, reach, more, than, twice, that, size, and, are, considered, difficult, even, compared, to, most, other, similar, sized, sharks, such, as, carcharhinus, species, lemon, shark, and, sand, tiger, shark, regularly, kept, by, public, aquariums, they, are, particularly, vulnerable, during, transport, between, facilities, may, rub, on, surfaces, in, tanks, and, may, collide, with, rocks, causing, injuries, to, their, heads, so, they, require, very, large, specially, adapted, tanks, as, a, consequence, relatively, few, public, aquaria, have, kept, them, for, long, periods, the, scalloped, hammerhead, is, the, most, frequently, maintained, large, species, and, it, has, been, kept, long, term, at, public, aquaria, in, most, continents, but, primarily, in, north, america, europe, and, asia, in, 2014, fewer, than, 15, public, aquaria, in, the, world, kept, scalloped, hammerheads, great, hammerheads, have, been, kept, at, a, few, facilities, in, north, america, including, atlantis, paradise, island, resort, bahamas, adventure, aquarium, new, jersey, georgia, aquarium, atlanta, mote, marine, laboratory, florida, and, the, shark, reef, at, mandalay, bay, las, vegas, smooth, hammerheads, have, also, been, kept, in, the, past, humans, are, the, number, one, threat, to, hammerhead, sharks, although, they, are, not, usually, the, primary, target, hammerhead, sharks, are, caught, in, fisheries, all, over, the, world, tropical, fisheries, are, the, most, common, place, for, hammerheads, to, be, caught, because, of, their, preference, to, reside, in, warm, waters, the, total, number, of, hammerheads, caught, in, fisheries, is, recorded, in, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, of, the, united, nations, global, capture, production, dataset, the, number, steadily, increased, from, 75, metric, tons, in, 1990, to, 6, 313, metric, tons, by, 2010, shark, fin, traders, say, that, hammerheads, have, some, of, the, best, quality, fin, needles, which, makes, them, good, to, eat, when, prepared, properly, hong, kong, is, the, world, s, largest, fin, trade, market, and, accounts, for, about, 1, 5, of, the, total, annual, amount, of, fins, traded, it, is, estimated, that, around, 375, 000, great, hammerhead, sharks, alone, are, traded, per, year, which, is, equivalent, to, 21, 000, metric, tons, of, biomass, however, most, sharks, that, are, caught, are, only, used, for, their, fins, and, then, discarded, the, actual, meat, of, hammerheads, is, generally, unwanted, consumption, of, regular, hammerhead, meat, has, been, recorded, in, countries, such, as, trinidad, and, tobago, venezuela, kenya, and, japan, in, march, 2013, three, endangered, commercially, valuable, sharks, the, hammerheads, the, oceanic, whitetip, and, porbeagle, were, added, to, appendix, ii, of, cites, bringing, shark, fishing, and, commerce, of, these, species, under, licensing, and, regulation, among, torres, strait, islanders, the, hammerhead, shark, known, as, the, beizam, is, a, common, family, totem, and, often, represented, in, cultural, artefacts, such, as, the, elaborate, headdresses, worn, for, ceremonial, dances, known, as, dhari, dari, they, are, associated, with, law, and, order, renowned, artist, ken, thaiday, snr, is, known, for, his, representations, of, beizam, in, his, sculptural, dari, and, other, works, in, native, hawaiian, culture, sharks, are, considered, to, be, gods, of, the, sea, protectors, of, humans, and, cleaners, of, excessive, ocean, life, some, of, these, sharks, are, believed, to, be, family, members, who, died, and, have, been, reincarnated, into, shark, form, but, others, are, considered, man, eaters, also, known, as, niuhi, these, sharks, include, great, white, sharks, tiger, sharks, and, bull, sharks, the, hammerhead, shark, also, known, as, mano, kihikihi, is, not, considered, a, man, eater, or, niuhi, it, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, respected, sharks, of, the, ocean, an, aumakua, many, hawaiian, families, believe, that, they, have, an, aumakua, watching, over, them, and, protecting, them, from, the, niuhi, the, hammerhead, shark, is, thought, to, be, the, birth, animal, of, some, children, hawaiian, children, who, are, born, with, the, hammerhead, shark, as, an, animal, sign, are, believed, to, be, warriors, and, are, meant, to, sail, the, oceans, hammerhead, sharks, rarely, pass, through, the, waters, of, maui, but, many, maui, natives, believe, that, their, swimming, by, is, a, sign, that, the, gods, are, watching, over, the, families, and, the, oceans, are, clean, and, balanced
