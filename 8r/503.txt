cod, pl, cod, is, the, common, name, for, the, demersal, fish, genus, gadus, belonging, to, the, family, gadidae, cod, is, also, used, as, part, of, the, common, name, for, a, number, of, other, fish, species, and, one, species, that, belongs, to, genus, gadus, is, commonly, not, called, cod, alaska, pollock, gadus, chalcogrammus, the, two, most, common, species, of, cod, are, the, atlantic, cod, gadus, morhua, which, lives, in, the, colder, waters, and, deeper, sea, regions, throughout, the, north, atlantic, and, the, pacific, cod, gadus, macrocephalus, which, is, found, in, both, eastern, and, western, regions, of, the, northern, pacific, gadus, morhua, was, named, by, linnaeus, in, 1758, however, g, morhua, callarias, a, low, salinity, nonmigratory, race, restricted, to, parts, of, the, baltic, was, originally, described, as, gadus, callarias, by, linnaeus, cod, as, food, is, popular, in, several, parts, of, the, world, it, has, a, mild, flavour, and, a, dense, flaky, white, flesh, cod, livers, are, processed, to, make, cod, liver, oil, a, common, source, of, vitamin, a, vitamin, d, vitamin, e, and, omega, 3, fatty, acids, epa, and, dha, young, atlantic, cod, or, haddock, prepared, in, strips, for, cooking, is, called, scrod, in, the, united, kingdom, atlantic, cod, is, one, of, the, most, common, ingredients, in, fish, and, chips, along, with, haddock, and, plaice, at, various, times, in, the, past, taxonomists, included, many, species, in, the, genus, gadus, most, of, these, are, now, either, classified, in, other, genera, or, have, been, recognized, as, forms, of, one, of, three, species, all, these, species, have, a, number, of, common, names, most, of, them, ending, with, the, word, cod, whereas, other, species, as, closely, related, have, other, common, names, such, as, pollock, and, haddock, however, many, other, unrelated, species, also, have, common, names, ending, with, cod, the, usage, often, changes, with, different, localities, and, at, different, times, three, species, in, the, genus, gadus, are, currently, called, cod, the, fourth, species, of, genus, gadus, gadus, chalcogrammus, is, commonly, called, alaska, pollock, or, walleye, pollock, but, there, are, also, less, widespread, alternative, trade, names, highlighting, the, fish, s, belonging, to, the, cod, genus, like, snow, cod, or, bigeye, cod, cod, forms, part, of, the, common, name, of, many, other, fish, no, longer, classified, in, the, genus, gadus, many, are, members, of, the, family, gadidae, others, are, members, of, three, related, families, within, the, order, gadiformes, whose, names, include, the, word, cod, the, morid, cods, moridae, 100, or, so, species, the, eel, cods, muraenolepididae, four, species, and, the, eucla, cod, euclichthyidae, one, species, the, tadpole, cod, family, ranicipitidae, has, now, been, placed, in, gadidae, some, fish, have, common, names, derived, from, cod, such, as, codling, codlet, or, tomcod, codling, is, also, used, as, a, name, for, a, young, cod, some, fish, commonly, known, as, cod, are, unrelated, to, gadus, part, of, this, name, confusion, is, market, driven, severely, shrunken, atlantic, cod, stocks, have, led, to, the, marketing, of, cod, replacements, using, culinary, names, of, the, form, x, cod, according, to, culinary, rather, than, phyletic, similarity, the, common, names, for, the, following, species, have, become, well, established, note, that, all, inhabit, the, southern, hemisphere, fish, of, the, order, perciformes, that, are, commonly, called, cod, include, almost, all, coral, cod, reef, cod, or, rock, cod, are, also, in, order, perciformes, most, are, better, known, as, groupers, and, belong, to, the, family, serranidae, others, belong, to, the, nototheniidae, two, exceptions, are, the, australasian, red, rock, cod, which, belongs, to, a, different, order, see, below, and, the, fish, known, simply, as, the, rock, cod, and, as, soft, cod, in, new, zealand, lotella, rhacina, which, as, noted, above, actually, is, related, to, the, true, cod, it, is, a, morid, cod, from, the, order, scorpaeniformes, the, tadpole, cod, family, ranicipitidae, and, the, eucla, cod, family, euclichthyidae, were, formerly, classified, in, the, order, ophidiiformes, but, are, now, grouped, with, the, gadiformes, some, fish, that, do, not, have, cod, in, their, names, are, sometimes, sold, as, cod, haddock, and, whiting, belong, to, the, same, family, the, gadidae, as, cod, cods, of, the, genus, gadus, have, three, rounded, dorsal, and, two, anal, fins, the, pelvic, fins, are, small, with, the, first, ray, extended, and, are, set, under, the, gill, cover, i, e, the, throat, region, in, front, of, the, pectoral, fins, the, upper, jaw, extends, over, the, lower, jaw, which, has, a, well, developed, chin, barbel, the, eyes, are, medium, sized, approximately, the, same, as, the, length, of, the, chin, barbel, cod, have, a, distinct, white, lateral, line, running, from, the, gill, slit, above, the, pectoral, fin, to, the, base, of, the, caudal, or, tail, fin, the, back, tends, to, be, a, greenish, to, sandy, brown, and, shows, extensive, mottling, especially, towards, the, lighter, sides, and, white, belly, dark, brown, colouration, of, the, back, and, sides, is, not, uncommon, especially, for, individuals, that, have, resided, in, rocky, inshore, regions, the, atlantic, cod, can, change, colour, at, certain, water, depths, it, has, two, distinct, colour, phases, gray, green, and, reddish, brown, its, average, weight, is, 5, 12, kilograms, 11, 26, pounds, but, specimens, weighing, up, to, 100, kg, 220, lb, have, been, recorded, pacific, cod, are, smaller, than, atlantic, cod, and, are, darker, in, colour, atlantic, cod, gadus, morhua, live, in, the, colder, waters, and, deeper, sea, regions, throughout, the, north, atlantic, pacific, cod, gadus, macrocephalus, is, found, in, both, eastern, and, western, regions, of, the, pacific, atlantic, cod, could, be, further, divided, into, several, stocks, including, the, arcto, norwegian, north, sea, baltic, sea, faroe, iceland, east, greenland, west, greenland, newfoundland, and, labrador, stocks, there, seems, to, be, little, interchange, between, the, stocks, although, migrations, to, their, individual, breeding, grounds, may, involve, distances, of, 300, kilometres, 190, statute, miles, 160, nautical, miles, or, more, for, instance, eastern, baltic, cod, shows, specific, reproductive, adaptations, to, low, salinity, compared, to, western, baltic, and, atlantic, cod, atlantic, cod, occupy, varied, habitats, favouring, rough, ground, especially, inshore, and, are, demersal, in, depths, between, 6, and, 60, metres, 20, and, 200, feet, 3, and, 30, fathoms, 80, m, 260, ft, 44, fathoms, on, average, although, not, uncommonly, to, depths, of, 600, m, 2, 000, ft, 330, fathoms, off, the, norwegian, and, new, england, coasts, and, on, the, grand, banks, of, newfoundland, cod, congregate, at, certain, seasons, in, water, of, 30, 70, m, 100, 200, ft, 20, 40, fathoms, depth, cod, are, gregarious, and, form, schools, although, shoaling, tends, to, be, a, feature, of, the, spawning, season, spawning, of, northeastern, atlantic, cod, occurs, between, january, and, april, march, and, april, are, the, peak, months, at, a, depth, of, 200, metres, 660, ft, in, specific, spawning, grounds, at, water, temperatures, between, 4, and, 6, c, 39, and, 43, f, around, the, uk, the, major, spawning, grounds, are, in, the, middle, to, southern, north, sea, the, start, of, the, bristol, channel, north, of, newquay, the, irish, channel, both, east, and, west, of, the, isle, of, man, around, stornoway, and, east, of, helmsdale, prespawning, courtship, involves, fin, displays, and, male, grunting, which, leads, to, pairing, the, male, inverts, himself, beneath, the, female, and, the, pair, swim, in, circles, while, spawning, the, eggs, are, planktonic, and, hatch, between, eight, and, 23, days, with, larva, reaching, 4, millimetres, 5, 32, inch, in, length, this, planktonic, phase, lasts, some, ten, weeks, enabling, the, young, cod, to, increase, its, body, weight, by, 40, fold, and, growing, to, about, 2, cm, 3, 4, in, the, young, cod, then, move, to, the, seabed, and, change, their, diet, to, small, benthic, crustaceans, such, as, isopods, and, small, crabs, they, increase, in, size, to, 8, cm, 3, in, in, the, first, six, months, 14, 18, cm, 5, 1, 2, 7, in, by, the, end, of, their, first, year, and, to, 25, 35, cm, 10, 14, in, by, the, end, of, the, second, growth, tends, to, be, less, at, higher, latitudes, cod, reach, maturity, at, about, 50, cm, 20, in, at, about, 3, to, 4, years, of, age, changes, in, growth, rate, over, decades, of, particular, stocks, have, been, reported, current, eastern, baltic, cod, shows, the, lowest, growth, observed, since, 1955, adult, cod, are, active, hunters, feeding, on, sand, eels, whiting, haddock, small, cod, squid, crabs, lobsters, mussels, worms, mackerel, and, molluscs, in, the, baltic, sea, the, most, important, prey, species, are, herring, and, sprat, many, studies, that, analyze, the, stomach, contents, of, these, fish, indicate, that, cod, is, the, top, predator, preying, on, the, herring, and, sprat, sprat, form, particularly, high, concentrations, in, the, bornholm, basin, in, the, southern, baltic, sea, although, cod, feed, primarily, on, adult, sprat, sprat, tend, to, prey, on, the, cod, eggs, and, larvae, cod, and, related, species, are, plagued, by, parasites, for, example, the, cod, worm, lernaeocera, branchialis, starts, life, as, a, copepod, like, larva, a, small, free, swimming, crustacean, the, first, host, used, by, the, larva, is, a, flatfish, or, lumpsucker, which, it, captures, with, grasping, hooks, at, the, front, of, its, body, it, penetrates, the, fish, with, a, thin, filament, which, it, uses, to, suck, the, fish, s, blood, the, nourished, larvae, then, mate, on, the, fish, the, female, larva, with, her, now, fertilized, eggs, then, finds, a, cod, or, a, cod, like, fish, such, as, a, haddock, or, whiting, there, the, larva, clings, to, the, gills, while, it, metamorphoses, into, a, plump, sinusoidal, wormlike, body, with, a, coiled, mass, of, egg, strings, at, the, rear, the, front, part, of, the, worm, s, body, penetrates, the, body, of, the, cod, until, it, enters, the, rear, bulb, of, the, host, s, heart, there, firmly, rooted, in, the, cod, s, circulatory, system, the, front, part, of, the, parasite, develops, like, the, branches, of, a, tree, reaching, into, the, main, artery, in, this, way, the, worm, extracts, nutrients, from, the, cod, s, blood, remaining, safely, tucked, beneath, the, cod, s, gill, cover, until, it, releases, a, new, generation, of, offspring, into, the, water, the, 2006, northwest, atlantic, cod, quota, is, 23, 000, tons, representing, half, the, available, stocks, while, the, northeast, atlantic, quota, is, 473, 000, tons, pacific, cod, is, currently, enjoying, strong, global, demand, the, 2006, total, allowable, catch, tac, for, the, gulf, of, alaska, and, aleutian, islands, was, 260, 000, tons, farming, of, atlantic, cod, has, received, a, significant, amount, of, interest, due, to, the, overall, trend, of, increasing, cod, prices, alongside, reduced, wild, catches, however, progress, in, creating, large, scale, farming, of, cod, has, been, slow, mainly, due, to, bottlenecks, in, the, larval, production, stage, where, survival, and, growth, are, often, unpredictable, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, bottleneck, may, be, overcome, by, ensuring, cod, larvae, are, fed, diets, with, similar, nutritional, content, as, the, copepods, they, feed, on, in, the, wild, recent, examples, have, shown, that, increasing, dietary, levels, of, minerals, such, as, selenium, iodine, and, zinc, may, improve, survival, and, or, biomarkers, for, health, in,

an, important, economic, commodity, in, international, markets, since, the, viking, period, around, 800, ad, norwegians, travelled, with, dried, cod, and, soon, a, dried, cod, market, developed, in, southern, europe, this, market, has, lasted, for, more, than, 1, 000, years, enduring, the, black, death, wars, and, other, crises, and, is, still, an, important, norwegian, fish, trade, the, portuguese, began, fishing, cod, in, the, 15th, century, clipfish, is, widely, enjoyed, in, portugal, the, basques, played, an, important, role, in, the, cod, trade, and, allegedly, found, the, canadian, fishing, banks, before, columbus, discovery, of, america, the, north, american, east, coast, developed, in, part, due, to, the, vast, cod, stocks, many, cities, in, the, new, england, area, are, located, near, cod, fishing, grounds, the, fish, was, so, important, to, the, history, and, development, of, massachusetts, the, state, s, house, of, representatives, hung, a, wood, carving, of, a, codfish, known, as, the, sacred, cod, of, massachusetts, in, its, chambers, apart, from, the, long, history, cod, differ, from, most, fish, because, the, fishing, grounds, are, far, from, population, centres, the, large, cod, fisheries, along, the, coast, of, north, norway, and, in, particular, close, to, the, lofoten, islands, have, been, developed, almost, uniquely, for, export, depending, on, sea, transport, of, stockfish, over, large, distances, since, the, introduction, of, salt, dried, and, salted, cod, clipfish, or, klippfisk, in, norwegian, has, also, been, exported, by, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, the, hanseatic, league, dominated, trade, operations, and, sea, transport, with, bergen, as, the, most, important, port, william, pitt, the, elder, criticizing, the, treaty, of, paris, in, parliament, claimed, cod, was, british, gold, and, that, it, was, folly, to, restore, newfoundland, fishing, rights, to, the, french, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, in, the, new, world, especially, in, massachusetts, and, newfoundland, cod, became, a, major, commodity, creating, trade, networks, and, cross, cultural, exchanges, in, 1733, britain, tried, to, gain, control, over, trade, between, new, england, and, the, british, caribbean, by, imposing, the, molasses, act, which, they, believed, would, eliminate, the, trade, by, making, it, unprofitable, the, cod, trade, grew, instead, because, the, french, were, eager, to, work, with, the, new, englanders, in, a, lucrative, contraband, arrangement, in, addition, to, increasing, trade, the, new, england, settlers, organized, into, a, codfish, aristocracy, the, colonists, rose, up, against, britain, s, tariff, on, an, import, in, the, 20th, century, iceland, re, emerged, as, a, fishing, power, and, entered, the, cod, wars, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, fishing, off, the, european, and, american, coasts, severely, depleted, stocks, and, become, a, major, political, issue, the, necessity, of, restricting, catches, to, allow, stocks, to, recover, upset, the, fishing, industry, and, politicians, who, are, reluctant, to, hurt, employment, on, july, 2, 1992, the, honourable, john, crosbie, canadian, federal, minister, of, fisheries, and, oceans, declared, a, two, year, moratorium, on, the, northern, cod, fishery, a, designated, fishing, region, off, the, coast, of, newfoundland, after, data, showed, that, the, total, cod, biomass, had, suffered, a, collapse, to, less, than, 1, of, its, normal, value, the, minister, championed, the, measure, as, a, temporary, solution, allowing, the, cod, population, time, to, recover, the, fisheries, had, long, shaped, the, lives, and, communities, on, canada, s, atlantic, eastern, coast, for, the, preceding, five, centuries, societies, which, are, dependent, on, fishing, have, a, strong, mutual, relationship, with, them, the, act, of, fishing, changes, the, ecosystems, balance, which, forces, the, fishery, and, in, turn, the, fishing, societies, to, adapt, to, new, ecological, conditions, the, near, complete, destruction, of, the, atlantic, northwest, cod, biomass, off, the, shores, devastated, coastal, communities, which, had, been, overexploiting, the, same, cod, population, for, decades, the, fishermen, along, the, atlantic, northwest, had, employed, modern, fishing, technologies, including, the, ecologically, devastating, practice, of, trawling, especially, in, the, years, leading, up, to, the, 1990s, in, the, misguided, belief, that, fishing, stocks, are, perpetually, plentiful, and, unable, to, be, depleted, after, this, assumption, was, empirically, and, abruptly, shown, to, be, incorrect, to, the, dismay, of, government, officials, and, rural, workers, some, 19, 000, fishermen, and, cod, processing, plant, workers, in, newfoundland, lost, their, employment, the, powerful, economic, engine, of, rural, newfoundland, coughed, wheezed, and, died, nearly, 40, 000, workers, and, harvesters, in, the, provinces, of, newfoundland, and, labrador, applied, for, the, federal, relief, program, tags, the, atlantic, groundfish, strategy, abandoned, and, rusting, fishing, boats, still, litter, the, coasts, of, newfoundland, and, the, canadian, northwest, to, this, day, the, fishery, minister, john, crosbie, after, delivering, a, speech, on, the, day, before, the, declaration, of, the, moratorium, or, july, 1, 1992, was, publicly, heckled, and, verbally, harassed, by, disgruntled, locals, at, a, fishing, village, the, moratorium, initially, lasting, for, only, two, years, was, indefinitely, extended, after, it, became, evident, that, cod, populations, had, not, recovered, at, all, but, instead, had, continued, to, spiral, downward, in, both, size, and, numbers, due, to, the, damage, caused, by, decades, of, horrible, fishing, practices, and, the, fact, that, the, moratorium, had, permitted, exceptions, for, food, fisheries, for, personal, consumption, purposes, to, this, very, day, some, 12, 000, tons, of, northwest, cod, are, still, being, caught, every, year, along, the, newfoundland, coast, by, local, fishermen, the, collapse, of, the, four, million, ton, biomass, which, had, persevered, through, several, previous, marine, extinctions, over, tens, of, millions, of, years, in, a, timespan, of, no, more, than, 20, years, is, oft, cited, by, researchers, as, one, of, the, most, visible, examples, of, the, phenomenon, of, the, tragedy, of, the, commons, factors, which, had, been, implicated, as, contributing, to, the, collapse, include, overfishing, government, mismanagement, the, disregard, of, scientific, uncertainty, warming, habitat, waters, declining, reproduction, and, plain, human, ignorance, the, northern, cod, biomass, has, been, recovering, slowly, since, the, imposition, of, the, moratorium, however, as, of, 2021, the, growth, of, the, cod, population, has, been, stagnant, since, 2017, and, some, scientists, argue, that, the, population, will, not, rebound, unless, the, fisheries, department, of, canada, lower, its, yearly, quota, to, 5, 000, tons
