occupational, safety, and, health, osh, or, occupational, health, and, safety, ohs, is, a, multidisciplinary, field, concerned, with, the, safety, health, and, welfare, of, people, at, work, i, e, while, performing, duties, required, by, one, s, occupation, osh, is, related, to, the, fields, of, occupational, medicine, and, occupational, hygiene, and, aligns, with, workplace, health, promotion, initiatives, osh, also, protects, all, the, general, public, who, may, be, affected, by, the, occupational, environment, according, to, the, official, estimates, of, the, united, nations, the, who, ilo, joint, estimate, of, the, work, related, burden, of, disease, and, injury, almost, 2, million, people, die, each, year, due, to, exposure, to, occupational, risk, factors, globally, more, than, 2, 78, million, people, die, annually, as, a, result, of, workplace, related, accidents, or, diseases, corresponding, to, one, death, every, fifteen, seconds, there, are, an, additional, 374, million, non, fatal, work, related, injuries, annually, it, is, estimated, that, the, economic, burden, of, occupational, related, injury, and, death, is, nearly, four, per, cent, of, the, global, gross, domestic, product, each, year, the, human, cost, of, this, adversity, is, enormous, in, common, law, jurisdictions, employers, have, the, common, law, duty, also, called, duty, of, care, to, take, reasonable, care, of, the, safety, of, their, employees, statute, law, may, in, addition, impose, other, general, duties, introduce, specific, duties, and, create, government, bodies, with, powers, to, regulate, occupational, safety, issues, details, of, this, vary, from, jurisdiction, to, jurisdiction, prevention, of, workplace, incidents, and, occupational, diseases, is, addressed, through, the, implementation, of, occupational, safety, and, health, programs, at, company, level, the, international, labour, organization, ilo, and, the, world, health, organization, who, share, a, common, definition, of, occupational, health, it, was, first, adopted, by, the, joint, ilo, who, committee, on, occupational, health, at, its, first, session, in, 1950, occupational, health, should, aim, at, the, promotion, and, maintenance, of, the, highest, degree, of, physical, mental, and, social, well, being, of, workers, in, all, occupations, the, prevention, amongst, workers, of, departures, from, health, caused, by, their, working, conditions, the, protection, of, workers, in, their, employment, from, risks, resulting, from, factors, adverse, to, health, the, placing, and, maintenance, of, the, worker, in, an, occupational, environment, adapted, to, his, physiological, and, psychological, capabilities, and, to, summarize, the, adaptation, of, work, to, man, and, of, each, man, to, his, job, in, 1995, a, consensus, statement, was, added, the, main, focus, in, occupational, health, is, on, three, different, objectives, i, the, maintenance, and, promotion, of, workers, health, and, working, capacity, ii, the, improvement, of, working, environment, and, work, to, become, conducive, to, safety, and, health, and, iii, development, of, work, organizations, and, working, cultures, in, a, direction, which, supports, health, and, safety, at, work, and, in, doing, so, also, promotes, a, positive, social, climate, and, smooth, operation, and, may, enhance, productivity, of, the, undertakings, the, concept, of, working, culture, is, intended, in, this, context, to, mean, a, reflection, of, the, essential, value, systems, adopted, by, the, undertaking, concerned, such, a, culture, is, reflected, in, practice, in, the, managerial, systems, personnel, policy, principles, for, participation, training, policies, and, quality, management, of, the, undertaking, an, alternative, definition, for, occupational, health, given, by, the, who, is, occupational, health, deals, with, all, aspects, of, health, and, safety, in, the, workplace, and, has, a, strong, focus, on, primary, prevention, of, hazards, the, expression, occupational, health, as, originally, adopted, by, the, who, and, the, ilo, refers, to, both, short, and, long, term, adverse, health, effects, in, more, recent, times, the, expressions, occupational, safety, and, health, and, occupational, health, and, safety, have, come, into, use, and, have, also, been, adopted, in, works, by, the, ilo, based, on, the, general, understanding, that, occupational, health, refers, to, hazards, associated, to, disease, and, long, term, effects, while, occupational, safety, hazards, are, those, associated, to, work, accidents, causing, injury, and, sudden, severe, conditions, research, and, regulation, of, occupational, safety, and, health, are, a, relatively, recent, phenomenon, as, labor, movements, arose, in, response, to, worker, concerns, in, the, wake, of, the, industrial, revolution, workers, safety, and, health, entered, consideration, as, a, labor, related, issue, written, works, on, occupational, diseases, began, to, appear, by, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, when, demand, for, gold, and, silver, was, rising, due, to, the, increase, in, trade, and, iron, copper, and, lead, were, also, in, demand, from, the, nascent, firearms, market, deeper, mining, became, common, as, a, consequence, in, 1473, ulrich, ellenbog, a, german, physician, wrote, a, short, treatise, on, the, poisonous, wicked, fumes, and, smokes, focused, on, coal, nitric, acid, lead, and, mercury, fumes, encountered, by, metal, workers, and, goldsmiths, in, 1587, paracelsus, 1493, 1541, published, the, first, work, on, the, mine, and, smelter, workers, diseases, in, it, he, gave, accounts, of, miners, lung, sickness, in, 1526, georgius, agricola, s, 1494, 1553, de, re, metallica, a, treaty, on, metallurgy, described, accidents, and, diseases, prevalent, among, miners, and, recommended, practices, to, prevent, them, like, paracelsus, agricola, mentioned, the, dust, that, eats, away, the, lungs, and, implants, consumption, the, seeds, of, state, intervention, to, correct, social, ills, were, sown, during, the, reign, of, elizabeth, i, by, the, poor, laws, which, originated, in, attempts, to, alleviate, hardship, arising, from, widespread, poverty, while, they, were, perhaps, more, to, do, with, a, need, to, contain, unrest, than, morally, motivated, they, were, significant, in, transferring, responsibility, for, helping, the, needy, from, private, hands, to, the, state, in, 1713, bernardino, ramazzini, 1633, 1714, often, described, as, the, father, of, occupational, medicine, and, a, precursor, to, occupational, health, published, his, de, morbis, artificum, diatriba, dissertation, on, workers, diseases, which, outlined, the, health, hazards, of, chemicals, dust, metals, repetitive, or, violent, motions, odd, postures, and, other, disease, causative, agents, encountered, by, workers, in, more, than, fifty, occupations, it, was, the, first, broad, ranging, presentation, of, occupational, diseases, percivall, pott, 1714, 1788, an, english, surgeon, described, cancer, in, chimney, sweeps, chimney, sweeps, carcinoma, the, first, recognition, of, an, occupational, cancer, in, history, the, united, kingdom, was, the, first, nation, to, industrialize, soon, shocking, evidence, emerged, of, serious, physical, and, moral, harm, suffered, by, children, and, young, persons, in, the, cotton, textile, mills, as, a, result, of, exploitation, of, cheap, labor, in, the, factory, system, responding, to, calls, for, remedial, action, from, philanthropists, and, some, of, the, more, enlightened, employers, in, 1802, sir, robert, peel, himself, a, mill, owner, introduced, a, bill, to, parliament, with, the, aim, of, improving, their, conditions, this, would, engender, the, health, and, morals, of, apprentices, act, 1802, generally, believed, to, be, the, first, attempt, to, regulate, conditions, of, work, in, the, united, kingdom, the, act, applied, only, to, cotton, textile, mills, and, required, employers, to, keep, premises, clean, and, healthy, by, twice, yearly, washings, with, quicklime, to, ensure, there, were, sufficient, windows, to, admit, fresh, air, and, to, supply, apprentices, i, e, pauper, and, orphan, employees, with, sufficient, and, suitable, clothing, and, accommodation, for, sleeping, it, was, the, first, of, the, 19th, century, factory, acts, charles, thackrah, 1795, 1833, another, pioneer, of, occupational, medicine, wrote, a, report, on, the, state, of, children, employed, in, cotton, factories, which, was, sent, to, the, parliament, in, 1818, thackrah, recognized, issues, of, inequalities, of, health, in, the, workplace, with, manufacturing, in, towns, causing, higher, mortality, than, agriculture, the, act, of, 1833, created, a, dedicated, professional, factory, inspectorate, the, initial, remit, of, the, inspectorate, was, to, police, restrictions, on, the, working, hours, in, the, textile, industry, of, children, and, young, persons, introduced, to, prevent, chronic, overwork, identified, as, leading, directly, to, ill, health, and, deformation, and, indirectly, to, a, high, accident, rate, in, 1840, a, royal, commission, published, its, findings, on, the, state, of, conditions, for, the, workers, of, the, mining, industry, that, documented, the, appallingly, dangerous, environment, that, they, had, to, work, in, and, the, high, frequency, of, accidents, the, commission, sparked, public, outrage, which, resulted, in, the, mines, and, collieries, act, of, 1842, the, act, set, up, an, inspectorate, for, mines, and, collieries, which, resulted, in, many, prosecutions, and, safety, improvements, and, by, 1850, inspectors, were, able, to, enter, and, inspect, premises, at, their, discretion, on, the, urging, of, the, factory, inspectorate, a, further, act, in, 1844, giving, similar, restrictions, on, working, hours, for, women, in, the, textile, industry, introduced, a, requirement, for, machinery, guarding, but, only, in, the, textile, industry, and, only, in, areas, that, might, be, accessed, by, women, or, children, the, latter, act, was, the, first, to, take, a, significant, step, toward, improvement, of, workers, safety, as, the, former, focused, on, health, aspects, alone, the, first, decennial, british, registrar, general, s, mortality, report, was, issued, in, 1851, deaths, were, categorized, by, social, classes, with, class, i, corresponding, to, professionals, and, executives, and, class, v, representing, unskilled, workers, the, report, showed, that, mortality, rates, increased, with, the, class, number, otto, von, bismarck, inaugurated, the, first, social, insurance, legislation, in, 1883, and, the, first, worker, s, compensation, law, in, 1884, the, first, of, their, kind, in, the, western, world, similar, acts, followed, in, other, countries, partly, in, response, to, labor, unrest, the, united, states, are, responsible, for, the, first, health, program, focusing, on, workplace, conditions, this, was, the, marine, hospital, service, inaugurated, in, 1798, and, providing, care, for, merchant, seamen, this, was, the, beginning, of, what, would, become, the, us, public, health, service, usphs, the, first, worker, compensation, acts, in, the, united, states, were, passed, in, new, york, in, 1910, and, in, washington, and, wisconsin, in, 1911, later, rulings, included, occupational, diseases, in, the, scope, of, the, compensation, which, was, initially, restricted, to, accidents, in, 1914, the, usphs, set, up, the, office, of, industrial, hygiene, and, sanitation, the, ancestor, of, the, current, national, institute, for, safety, and, health, niosh, in, the, early, 20th, century, workplace, disasters, were, still, common, for, example, in, 1911, a, fire, at, the, triangle, shirtwaist, company, in, new, york, killed, 146, workers, mostly, women, and, immigrants, most, died, trying, to, open, exits, that, had, been, locked, radium, dial, painter, cancers, phossy, jaw, mercury, and, lead, poisonings, silicosis, and, other, pneumoconioses, were, extremely, common, the, enactment, of, the, federal, coal, mine, health, and, safety, act, of, 1969, was, quickly, followed, by, the, 1970, occupational, safety, and, health, act, which, established, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, and, niosh, in, their, current, form, a, wide, array, of, workplace, hazards, can, damage, the, health, and, safety, of, people, at, work, these, include, but, are, not, limited, to, chemicals, biological, agents, physical, factors, adverse, ergonomic, conditions, allergens, a, complex, network, of, safety, risks, as, well, a, broad, range, of, psychosocial, risk, factors, personal, protective, equipment, can, help, protect, against, many, of, these, hazards, a, landmark, study, conducted, by, the, world, health, organization, and, the, international, labour, organization, found, that, exposure, to, long, working, hours, is, the, occupational, risk, factor, with, the, largest, attributable, burden, of, disease, i, e, an, estimated, 745, 000, fatalities, from, ischemic, heart, disease, and, stroke, events, in, 2016, this, makes, overwork, the, globally, leading, occupational, health, risk, factor, physical, hazards, affect, many, people, in, the, workplace, occupational, hearing, loss, is, the, most, common, work, related, injury, in, the, united, states, with, 22, million, workers, exposed, to, hazardous, occupational, noise, levels, at, work, and, an, estimated, 242, million, spent, annually, on, worker, s, compensation, for, hearing, loss, disability, falls, are, also, a, common, cause, of, occupational, injuries, and, fatalities, especially, in, construction, extraction, transportation, healthcare, and, building, cleaning, and, maintenance, machines, have, moving, parts, sharp, edges, hot, surfaces, and, other, hazards, with, the, potential, to, crush, burn, cut, shear, stab, or, otherwise, strike, or, wound, workers, if, used, unsafely, biological, hazards, biohazards, include, infectious, microorganisms, such, as, viruses, bacteria, and, toxins, produced, by, those, organisms, such, as, anthrax, biohazards, affect, workers, in, many, industries, influenza, for, example, affects, a, broad, population, of, workers, outdoor, workers, including, farmers, landscapers, and, construction, workers, risk, exposure, to, numerous, biohazards, including, animal, bites, and, stings, urushiol, from, poisonous, plants, and, diseases, transmitted, through, animals, such, as, the, west, nile, virus, and, lyme, disease, health, care, workers, including, veterinary, health, workers, risk, exposure, to, blood, borne, pathogens, and, various, infectious, diseases, especially, those, that, are, emerging, dangerous, chemicals, can, pose, a, chemical, hazard, in, the, workplace, there, are, many, classifications, of, hazardous, chemicals, including, neurotoxins, immune, agents, dermatologic, agents, carcinogens, reproductive, toxins, systemic, toxins, asthmagens, pneumoconiotic, agents, and, sensitizers, authorities, such, as, regulatory, agencies, set, occupational, exposure, limits, to, mitigate, the, risk, of, chemical, hazards, international, investigations, are, ongoing, into, the, health, effects, of, mixtures, of, chemicals, given, that, toxins, can, interact, synergistically, instead, of, merely, additively, for, example, there, is, some, evidence, that, certain, chemicals, are, harmful, at, low, levels, when, mixed, with, one, or, more, other, chemicals, such, synergistic, effects, may, be, particularly, important, in, causing, cancer, additionally, some, substances, such, as, heavy, metals, and, organohalogens, can, accumulate, in, the, body, over, time, thereby, enabling, small, incremental, daily, exposures, to, eventually, add, up, to, dangerous, levels, with, little, overt, warning, psychosocial, hazards, include, risks, to, the, mental, and, emotional, well, being, of, workers, such, as, feelings, of, job, insecurity, long, work, hours, and, poor, work, life, balance, psychological, abuse, has, been, found, present, within, the, workplace, as, evidenced, by, previous, research, a, study, by, gary, namie, on, workplace, emotional, abuse, found, that, 31, of, women, and, 21, of, men, who, reported, workplace, emotional, abuse, exhibited, three, key, symptoms, of, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, hypervigilance, intrusive, imagery, and, avoidance, behaviors, sexual, harassment, is, a, serious, hazard, that, can, be, found, in, workplaces, specific, occupational, safety, and, health, risk, factors, vary, depending, on, the, specific, sector, and, industry, construction, workers, might, be, particularly, at, risk, of, falls, for, instance, whereas, fishermen, might, be, particularly, at, risk, of, drowning, similarly, psychosocial, risks, such, as, workplace, violence, are, more, pronounced, for, certain, occupational, groups, such, as, health, care, employees, police, correctional, officers, and, teachers, agriculture, workers, are, often, at, risk, of, work, related, injuries, lung, disease, noise, induced, hearing, loss, skin, disease, as, well, as, certain, cancers, related, to, chemical, use, or, prolonged, sun, exposure, on, industrialized, farms, injuries, frequently, involve, the, use, of, agricultural, machinery, the, most, common, cause, of, fatal, agricultural, injuries, in, the, united, states, is, tractor, rollovers, which, can, be, prevented, by, the, use, of, roll, over, protection, structures, which, limit, the, risk, of, injury, in, case, a, tractor, rolls, over, pesticides, and, other, chemicals, used, in, farming, can, also, be, hazardous, to, worker, health, and, workers, exposed, to, pesticides, may, experience, illnesses, or, birth, defects, as, an, industry, in, which, families, including, children, commonly, work, alongside, their, families, agriculture, is, a, common, source, of, occupational, injuries, and, illnesses, among, younger, workers, common, causes, of, fatal, injuries, among, young, farm, worker, include, drowning, machinery, and, motor, vehicle, related, accidents, the, 2010, nhis, ohs, found, elevated, prevalence, rates, of, several, occupational, exposures, in, the, agriculture, forestry, and, fishing, sector, which, may, negatively, impact, health, these, workers, often, worked, long, hours, the, prevalence, rate, of, working, more, than, 48, hours, a, week, among, workers, employed, in, these, industries, was, 37, and, 24, worked, more, than, 60, hours, a, week, of, all, workers, in, these, industries, 85, frequently, worked, outdoors, compared, to, 25, of, all, us, workers, additionally, 53, were, frequently, exposed, to, vapors, gas, dust, or, fumes, compared, to, 25, of, all, us, workers, the, mining, industry, still, has, one, of, the, highest, rates, of, fatalities, of, any, industry, there, are, a, range, of, hazards, present, in, surface, and, underground, mining, operations, in, surface, mining, leading, hazards, include, such, issues, as, geological, instability, contact, with, plant, and, equipment, rock, blasting, thermal, environments, heat, and, cold, respiratory, health, black, lung, etc, in, underground, mining, operational, hazards, include, respiratory, health, explosions, and, gas, particularly, in, coal, mine, operations, geological, instability, electrical, equipment, contact, with, plant, and, equipment, heat, stress, inrush, of, bodies, of, water, falls, from, height, confined, spaces, ionising, radiation, etc, according, to, data, from, the, 2010, nhis, ohs, workers, employed, in, mining, and, oil, and, gas, extraction, industries, had, high, prevalence, rates, of, exposure, to, potentially, harmful, work, organization, characteristics, and, hazardous, chemicals, many, of, these, workers, worked, long, hours, 50, worked, more, than, 48, hours, a, week, and, 25, worked, more, than, 60, hours, a, week, in, 2010, additionally, 42, worked, non, standard, shifts, not, a, regular, day, shift, these, workers, also, had, high, prevalence, of, exposure, to, physical, chemical, hazards, in, 2010, 39, had, frequent, skin, contact, with, chemicals, among, nonsmoking, workers, 28, of, those, in, mining, and, oil, and, gas, extraction, industries, had, frequent, exposure, to, secondhand, smoke, at, work, about, two, thirds, were, frequently, exposed, to, vapors, gas, dust, or, fumes, at, work, construction, is, one, of, the, most, dangerous, occupations, in, the, world, incurring, more, occupational, fatalities, than, any, other, sector, in, both, the, united, states, and, in, the, european, union, in, 2009, the, fatal, occupational, injury, rate, among, construction, workers, in, the, united, states, was, nearly, three, times, that, for, all, workers, falls, are, one, of, the, most, common, causes, of, fatal, and, non, fatal, injuries, among, construction, workers, proper, safety, equipment, such, as, harnesses, and, guardrails, and, procedures, such, as, securing, ladders, and, inspecting, scaffolding, can, curtail, the, risk, of, occupational, injuries, in, the, construction, industry, due, to, the, fact, that, accidents, may, have, disastrous, consequences, for, employees, as, well, as, organizations, it, is, of, utmost, importance, to, ensure, health, and, safety, of, workers, and, compliance, with, hse, construction, requirements, health, and, safety, legislation, in, the, construction, industry, involves, many, rules, and, regulations, for, example, the, role, of, the, construction, design, management, cdm, coordinator, as, a, requirement, has, been, aimed, at, improving, health, and, safety, on, site, the, 2010, national, health, interview, survey, occupational, health, supplement, nhis, ohs, identified, work, organization, factors, and, occupational, psychosocial, and, chemical, physical, exposures, which, may, increase, some, health, risks, among, all, us, workers, in, the, construction, sector, 44, had, non, standard, work, arrangements, were, not, regular, permanent, employees, compared, to, 19, of, all, us, workers, 15, had, temporary, employment, compared, to, 7, of, all, us, workers, and, 55, experienced, job, insecurity, compared, to, 32, of, all, us, workers, prevalence, rates, for, exposure, to, physical, chemical, hazards, were, especially, high, for, the, construction, sector, among, nonsmoking, workers, 24, of, construction, workers, were, exposed, to, secondhand, smoke, while, only, 10, of, all, us, workers, were, exposed, other, physical, chemical, hazards, with, high, prevalence, rates, in, the, construction, industry, were, frequently, working, outdoors, 73, and, frequent, exposure, to, vapors, gas, dust, or, fumes, 51, the, service, sector, comprises, diverse, workplaces, each, type, of, workplace, has, its, own, health, risks, while, some, occupations, have, become, more, mobile, others, still, require, people, to, sit, at, desks, as, the, number, of, service, sector, jobs, has, risen, in, developed, countries, more, and, more, jobs, have, become, sedentary, presenting, an, array, of, health, problems, that, differ, from, health, problems, associated, with, manufacturing, and, the, primary, sector, contemporary, health, problems, include, obesity, some, working, conditions, such, as, occupational, stress, workplace, bullying, and, overwork, have, negative, consequences, for, physical, and, mental, health, tipped, wage, workers, are, at, a, higher, risk, of, negative, mental, health, outcomes, like, addiction, or, depression, the, higher, prevalence, of, mental, health, problems, may, be, linked, to, the, precarious, nature, of, service, work, including, lower, and, unpredictable, wages, insufficient, benefits, and, a, lack, of, control, over, work, hours, and, assigned, shifts, close, to, 70, of, tipped, wage, workers, are, women, additionally, almost, 40, percent, of, people, who, work, for, tips, are, people, of, color, 18, percent, are, latino, 10, percent, are, african, american, and, 9, percent, are, asian, immigrants, are, also, overrepresented, in, the, tipped, workforce, according, to, data, from, the, 2010, nhis, ohs, hazardous, physical, chemical, exposures, in, the, service, sector, were, lower, than, national, averages, on, the, other, hand, potentially, harmful, work, organization, characteristics, and, psychosocial, workplace, exposures, were, relatively, common, in, this, sector, among, all, workers, in, the, service, industry, 30, experienced, job, insecurity, in, 2010, 27, worked, non, standard, shifts, not, a, regular, day, shift, 21, had, non, standard, work, arrangements, were, not, regular, permanent, employees, due, to, the, manual, labor, involved, and, on, a, per, employee, basis, the, us, postal, service, ups, and, fedex, are, the, 4th, 5th, and, 7th, most, dangerous, companies, to, work, for, in, the, us, healthcare, workers, are, exposed, to, many, hazards, that, can, adversely, affect, their, health, and, well, being, long, hours, changing, shifts, physically, demanding, tasks, violence, and, exposures, to, infectious, diseases, and, harmful, chemicals, are, examples, of, hazards, that, put, these, workers, at, risk, for, illness, and, injury, musculoskeletal, injury, msi, is, the, most, common, health, hazard, in, for, healthcare, workers, and, in, workplaces, overall, injuries, can, be, prevented, by, using, proper, body, mechanics, according, to, the, bureau, of, labor, statistics, us, hospitals, recorded, 253, 700, work, related, injuries, and, illnesses, in, 2011, which, is, 6, 8, work, related, injuries, and, illnesses, for, every, 100, full, time, employees, the, injury, and, illness, rate, in, hospitals, is, higher, than, the, rates, in, construction, and, manufacturing, two, industries, that, are, traditionally, thought, to, be, relatively, hazardous, an, estimated, 2, 90, million, work, related, deaths, occurred, in, 2019, increased, from, 2, 78, million, death, from, 2015, about, one, third, of, the, total, work, related, deaths, 31, were, due, to, circulatory, diseases, while, cancer, contributed, 29, respiratory, diseases, 17, and, occupational, injuries, contributed, 11, or, about, 319, 000, fatalities, other, diseases, such, as, work, related, communicable, diseases, contributed, 6, while, neuropsychiatric, conditions, contributed, 3, and, work, related, digestive, disease, and, genitourinary, diseases, contributed, 1, each, the, contribution, of, cancers, and, circulatory, diseases, to, total, work, related, deaths, increased, from, 2015, while, deaths, due, to, occupational, injuries, decreased, although, work, related, injury, deaths, and, non, fatal, injuries, rates, were, on, a, decreasing, trend, the, total, deaths, and, non, fatal, outcomes, were, on, the, rise, cancers, represented, the, most, significant, cause, of, mortality, in, high, income, countries, the, number, of, non, fatal, occupational, injuries, for, 2019, was, estimated, to, be, 402, million, mortality, rate, is, unevenly, distributed, with, male, mortality, rate, 108, 3, per, 100, 000, employed, male, individuals, being, significantly, higher, than, female, rate, 48, 4, per, 100, 000, 6, 7, of, all, deaths, globally, are, represented, by, occupational, fatalities, certain, eu, member, states, admit, to, having, lacking, quality, control, in, occupational, safety, services, to, situations, in, which, risk, analysis, takes, place, without, any, on, site, workplace, visits, and, to, insufficient, implementation, of, certain, eu, osh, directives, disparities, between, member, states, result, in, different, impact, of, occupational, hazards, on, the, economy, in, the, early, 2000s, the, total, societal, costs, of, work, related, health, problems, and, accidents, varied, from, 2, 6, to, 3, 8, of, the, national, gdps, across, the, member, states, in, 2021, in, the, eu, 27, as, a, whole, 93, of, deaths, due, to, injury, were, of, males, one, of, the, decisions, taken, by, the, communist, regime, under, stalin, was, to, reduce, the, number, of, accidents, and, occupational, diseases, to, zero, the, tendency, to, decline, remained, in, the, russian, federation, in, the, early, 21st, century, however, as, in, previous, years, data, reporting, and, publication, was, incomplete, and, manipulated, so, that, the, actual, number, of, work, related, diseases, and, accidents, are, unknown, the, ilo, reports, that, according, to, the, information, provided, by, the, russian, government, there, are, 190, 000, work, related, fatalities, each, year, of, which, 15, 000, due, to, occupational, accidents, after, the, demise, of, the, ussr, enterprises, became, owned, by, oligarchs, who, were, not, interested, in, upholding, safe, and, healthy, conditions, in, the, workplace, expenditure, on, equipment, modernization, was, minimal, and, the, share, of, harmful, workplaces, increased, the, government, did, not, interfere, in, this, and, sometimes, it, helped, employers, at, first, the, increase, in, occupational, diseases, and, accidents, was, slow, due, to, the, fact, that, in, the, 1990s, it, was, compensated, by, mass, deindustrialization, however, in, the, 2000s, deindustrialization, slowed, and, occupational, diseases, and, injuries, started, to, rise, in, earnest, therefore, in, the, 2010s, the, ministry, of, labor, adopted, federal, law, no, 426, fz, this, piece, of, legislation, has, been, described, as, ineffective, and, based, on, the, superficial, assumption, that, the, issuance, of, personal, protective, equipment, to, the, employee, means, real, improvement, of, working, conditions, meanwhile, the, ministry, of, health, made, significant, changes, in, the, methods, of, risk, assessment, in, the, workplace, however, specialists, from, the, izmerov, research, institute, of, occupational, health, found, that, the, post, 2014, apparent, decrease, in, the, share, of, employees, engaged, in, hazardous, working, conditions, is, due, to, the, change, in, definitions, consequent, to, the, ministry, of, health, s, decision, but, does, not, reflect, actual, improvements, this, was, most, clearly, shown, in, the, results, for, the, aluminum, industry, further, problems, in, the, accounting, of, workplace, fatalities, arise, from, the, fact, that, multiple, russian, federal, entities, collect, and, publish, records, a, practice, that, should, be, avoided, in, 2008, alone, 2074, accidents, at, work, may, have, not, been, reported, in, official, government, sources, in, the, uk, there, were, 135, fatal, injuries, at, work, in, financial, year, 2022, 2023, compared, with, 651, in, 1974, the, year, when, the, health, and, safety, at, work, act, was, promulgated, the, fatal, injury, rate, declined, from, 2, 1, fatalities, per, 100, 000, workers, in, 1981, to, 0, 41, in, financial, year, 2022, 2023, over, recent, decades, reductions, in, both, fatal, and, non, fatal, workplace, injuries, have, been, very, significant, however, illnesses, statistics, have, not, uniformly, improved, while, musculoskeletal, disorders, have, diminished, the, rate, of, self, reported, work, related, stress, depression, or, anxiety, has, increased, and, the, rate, of, mesothelioma, deaths, has, remained, broadly, flat, due, to, past, asbestos, exposures, the, occupational, safety, and, health, statistics, oshs, program, in, the, bureau, of, labor, statistics, of, the, united, states, department, of, labor, compiles, information, about, workplace, fatalities, and, non, fatal, injuries, in, the, united, states, the, oshs, program, produces, three, annual, reports, the, bureau, also, uses, tools, like, aginjurynews, org, to, identify, and, compile, additional, sources, of, fatality, reports, for, their, datasets, between, 1913, and, 2013, workplace, fatalities, dropped, by, approximately, 80, in, 1970, an, estimated, 14, 000, workers, were, killed, on, the, job, by, 2021, in, spite, of, the, workforce, having, since, more, than, doubled, workplace, deaths, were, down, to, about, 5, 190, according, to, the, census, of, occupational, injuries, 5, 486, people, died, on, the, job, in, 2022, up, from, the, 2021, total, of, 5, 190, the, fatal, injury, rate, was, 3, 7, per, 100, 000, full, time, equivalent, workers, the, decrease, in, the, mortality, rate, is, only, partly, about, 10, 15, explained, by, the, deindustrialization, of, the, us, in, the, last, 40, years, about, 3, 5, million, nonfatal, workplace, injuries, and, illnesses, were, reported, by, private, industry, employers, in, 2022, occurring, at, a, rate, of, 3, 0, cases, per, 100, full, time, workers, employees, companies, may, adopt, a, safety, and, health, management, system, sms, either, voluntarily, or, because, required, by, applicable, regulations, to, deal, in, a, structured, and, systematic, way, with, safety, and, health, risks, in, their, workplace, an, sms, provides, a, systematic, way, to, assess, and, improve, prevention, of, workplace, accidents, and, incidents, based, on, structured, management, of, workplace, risks, and, hazards, it, must, be, adaptable, to, changes, in, the, organization, s, business, and, legislative, requirements, it, is, usually, based, on, the, deming, cycle, or, plan, do, check, act, pdca, principle, an, effective, sms, should, management, standards, across, a, range, of, business, functions, such, as, environment, quality, and, safety, are, now, being, designed, so, that, these, traditionally, disparate, elements, can, be, integrated, and, managed, within, a, single, business, management, system, and, not, as, separate, and, stand, alone, functions, therefore, some, organizations, dovetail, other, management, system, functions, such, as, process, safety, environmental, resource, management, or, quality, management, together, with, safety, management, to, meet, both, regulatory, requirements, industry, sector, requirements, and, their, own, internal, and, discretionary, standard, requirements, the, ilo, published, ilo, osh, 2001, on, guidelines, on, occupational, safety, and, health, management, systems, to, assist, organizations, with, introducing, osh, management, systems, these, guidelines, encouraged, continual, improvement, in, employee, health, and, safety, achieved, via, a, constant, process, of, policy, organization, planning, and, implementation, evaluation, and, action, for, improvement, all, supported, by, constant, auditing, to, determine, the, success, of, osh, actions, from, 1999, to, 2018, ohsas, 18001, was, adopted, as, a, british, and, polish, standard, and, widely, used, internationally, it, was, developed, by, a, selection, of, trade, bodies, international, standards, and, certification, bodies, to, address, a, gap, where, no, third, party, certifiable, international, standard, existed, it, was, designed, for, integration, with, iso, 9001, and, iso, 14001, ohsas, 18001, was, replaced, by, iso, 45001, which, was, published, in, march, 2018, and, implemented, in, march, 2021, national, management, system, standards, for, occupational, health, and, safety, include, as, nzs, 4801, for, australia, and, new, zealand, now, superseded, by, iso, 45001, csa, z1000, 14, for, canada, which, is, due, to, be, discontinued, in, favor, of, csa, z45001, 19, the, canadian, adoption, of, iso, 45000, and, ansi, assp, z10, for, the, united, states, in, germany, the, bavarian, state, government, in, collaboration, with, trade, associations, and, private, companies, issued, their, ohris, standard, for, occupational, health, and, safety, management, systems, a, new, revision, was, issued, in, 2018, the, taiwan, occupational, safety, and, health, management, system, toshms, was, issued, in, 1997, under, the, auspices, of, taiwan, s, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, the, terminology, used, in, osh, varies, between, countries, but, generally, speaking, hazard, risk, and, outcome, are, used, in, other, fields, to, describe, e, g, environmental, damage, or, damage, to, equipment, however, in, the, context, of, osh, harm, generally, describes, the, direct, or, indirect, degradation, temporary, or, permanent, of, the, physical, mental, or, social, well, being, of, workers, for, example, repetitively, carrying, out, manual, handling, of, heavy, objects, is, a, hazard, the, outcome, could, be, a, musculoskeletal, disorder, msd, or, an, acute, back, or, joint, injury, the, risk, can, be, expressed, numerically, e, g, a, 0, 5, or, 50, 50, chance, of, the, outcome, occurring, during, a, year, in, relative, terms, e, g, high, medium, low, or, with, a, multi, dimensional, classification, scheme, e, g, situation, specific, risks, hazard, identification, is, an, important, step, in, the, overall, risk, assessment, and, risk, management, process, it, is, where, individual, work, hazards, are, identified, assessed, and, controlled, or, eliminated, as, close, to, source, location, of, the, hazard, as, reasonably, practicable, as, technology, resources, social, expectation, or, regulatory, requirements, change, hazard, analysis, focuses, controls, more, closely, toward, the, source, of, the, hazard, thus, hazard, control, is, a, dynamic, program, of, prevention, hazard, based, programs, also, have, the, advantage, of, not, assigning, or, implying, there, are, acceptable, risks, in, the, workplace, a, hazard, based, program, may, not, be, able, to, eliminate, all, risks, but, neither, does, it, accept, satisfactory, but, still, risky, outcomes, and, as, those, who, calculate, and, manage, the, risk, are, usually, managers, while, those, exposed, to, the, risks, are, a, different, group, a, hazard, based, approach, can, bypass, conflict, inherent, in, a, risk, based, approach, the, information, that, needs, to, be, gathered, from, sources, should, apply, to, the, specific, type, of, work, from, which, the, hazards, can, come, from, examples, of, these, sources, include, interviews, with, people, who, have, worked, in, the, field, of, the, hazard, history, and, analysis, of, past, incidents, and, official, reports, of, work, and, the, hazards, encountered, of, these, the, personnel, interviews, may, be, the, most, critical, in, identifying, undocumented, practices, events, releases, hazards, and, other, relevant, information, once, the, information, is, gathered, from, a, collection, of, sources, it, is, recommended, for, these, to, be, digitally, archived, to, allow, for, quick, searching, and, to, have, a, physical, set, of, the, same, information, in, order, for, it, to, be, more, accessible, one, innovative, way, to, display, the, complex, historical, hazard, information, is, with, a, historical, hazards, identification, map, which, distills, the, hazard, information, into, an, easy, to, use, graphical, format, modern, occupational, safety, and, health, legislation, usually, demands, that, a, risk, assessment, be, carried, out, prior, to, making, an, intervention, this, assessment, should, the, calculation, of, risk, is, based, on, the, likelihood, or, probability, of, the, harm, being, realized, and, the, severity, of, the, consequences, this, can, be, expressed, mathematically, as, a, quantitative, assessment, by, assigning, low, medium, and, high, likelihood, and, severity, with, integers, and, multiplying, them, to, obtain, a, risk, factor, or, qualitatively, as, a, description, of, the, circumstances, by, which, the, harm, could, arise, the, assessment, should, be, recorded, and, reviewed, periodically, and, whenever, there, is, a, significant, change, to, work, practices, the, assessment, should, include, practical, recommendations, to, control, the, risk, once, recommended, controls, are, implemented, the, risk, should, be, re, calculated, to, determine, if, it, has, been, lowered, to, an, acceptable, level, generally, speaking, newly, introduced, controls, should, lower, risk, by, one, level, i, e, from, high, to, medium, or, from, medium, to, low, occupational, safety, and, health, practice, vary, among, nations, with, different, approaches, to, legislation, regulation, enforcement, and, incentives, for, compliance, in, the, eu, for, example, some, member, states, promote, osh, by, providing, public, monies, as, subsidies, grants, or, financing, while, others, have, created, tax, system, incentives, for, osh, investments, a, third, group, of, eu, member, states, has, experimented, with, using, workplace, accident, insurance, premium, discounts, for, companies, or, organizations, with, strong, osh, records, in, australia, four, of, the, six, states, and, both, territories, have, enacted, and, administer, harmonized, work, health, and, safety, legislation, in, accordance, with, the, intergovernmental, agreement, for, regulatory, and, operational, reform, in, occupational, health, and, safety, each, of, these, jurisdictions, has, enacted, work, health, and, safety, legislation, and, regulations, based, on, the, commonwealth, work, health, and, safety, act, 2011, and, common, codes, of, practice, developed, by, safe, work, australia, some, jurisdictions, have, also, included, mine, safety, under, the, model, approach, however, most, have, retained, separate, legislation, for, the, time, being, in, august, 2019, western, australia, committed, to, join, nearly, every, other, state, and, territory, in, implementing, the, harmonized, model, whs, act, regulations, and, other, subsidiary, legislation, victoria, has, retained, its, own, regime, although, the, model, whs, laws, themselves, drew, heavily, on, the, victorian, approach, in, canada, workers, are, covered, by, provincial, or, federal, labor, codes, depending, on, the, sector, in, which, they, work, workers, covered, by, federal, legislation,

governing, asbestos, and, fire, safety, management, embrace, the, concept, of, risk, assessment, the, other, key, aspect, of, the, uk, legislation, is, a, statutory, mechanism, for, worker, involvement, through, elected, health, and, safety, representatives, and, health, and, safety, committees, this, followed, a, similar, approach, in, scandinavia, and, that, approach, has, since, been, adopted, in, countries, such, as, australia, canada, new, zealand, and, malaysia, the, health, and, safety, executive, service, dealing, with, occupational, medicine, has, been, the, employment, medical, advisory, service, in, 2014, a, new, occupational, health, organization, the, health, and, work, service, was, created, to, provide, advice, and, assistance, to, employers, in, order, to, get, back, to, work, employees, on, long, term, sick, leave, the, service, funded, by, the, government, offers, medical, assessments, and, treatment, plans, on, a, voluntary, basis, to, people, on,

states, president, richard, nixon, signed, the, occupational, safety, and, health, act, into, law, on, 29, december, 1970, the, act, created, the, three, agencies, which, administer, osh, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, and, the, occupational, safety, and, health, review, commission, oshrc, the, act, authorized, osha, to, regulate, private, employers, in, the, 50, states, the, district, of, columbia, and, territories, it, includes, a, general, duty, clause, 29, u, s, c, 654, 5, a, requiring, an, employer, to, comply, with, the, act, and, regulations, derived, from, it, and, to, provide, employees, with, employment, and, a, place, of, employment, which, are, free, from, recognized, hazards, that, are, causing, or, are, likely, to, cause, death, or, serious, physical, harm, osha, was, established, in, 1971, under, the, department, of, labor, it, has, headquarters, in, washington, dc, and, ten, regional, offices, further, broken, down, into, districts, each, organized, into, three, sections, compliance, training, and, assistance, its, stated, mission, is, to, ensure, safe, and, healthful, working, conditions, for, workers, by, setting, and, enforcing, standards, and, by, providing, training, outreach, education, and, assistance, the, original, plan, was, for, osha, to, oversee, 50, state, plans, with, osha, funding, 50, of, each, plan, but, this, did, not, work, out, that, way, as, of, 2023, there, are, 26, approved, state, plans, with, four, covering, only, public, employees, and, osha, manages, the, plan, in, the, states, not, participating, osha, develops, safety, standards, in, the, code, of, federal, regulations, and, enforces, those, safety, standards, through, compliance, inspections, conducted, by, compliance, officers, enforcement, resources, are, focused, on, high, hazard, industries, worksites, may, apply, to, enter, osha, s,

ability, of, workers, therefore, evidence, based, information, must, be, integrated, with, professional, expertise, and, the, workers, values, contextual, factors, must, be, considered, related, to, legislation, culture, financial, and, technical, possibilities, ethical, considerations, should, be, heeded, the, roles, and, responsibilities, of, osh, professionals, vary, regionally, but, may, include, evaluating, working, environments, developing, endorsing, and, encouraging, measures, that, might, prevent, injuries, and, illnesses, providing, osh, information, to, employers, employees, and, the, public, providing, medical, examinations, and, assessing, the, success, of, worker, health, programs, in, the, netherlands, the, required, tasks, for, health, and, safety, staff, are, only, summarily, defined, and, include, dutch, law, influences, the, job, of, the, safety, professional, mainly, through, the, requirement, on, employers, to, use, the, services, of, a, certified, working, conditions, service, for, advice, a, certified, service, must, employ, sufficient, numbers, of, four, types, of, certified, experts, to, cover, the, risks, in, the, organizations, which, use, the, service, in, 2004, 14, of, health, and, safety, practitioners, in, the, netherlands, had, an, msc, and, 63, had, a, bsc, 23, had, training, as, an, osh, technician, in, norway, the, main, required, tasks, of, an, occupational, health, and, safety, practitioner, include, in, 2004, 37, of, health, and, safety, practitioners, in, norway, had, an, msc, and, 44, had, a, bsc, 19, had, training, as, an, osh, technician, there, are, multiple, levels, of, training, applicable, to, the, field, of, occupational, safety, and, health, programs, range, from, individual, non, credit, certificates, and, awareness, courses, focusing, on, specific, areas, of, concern, to, full, doctoral, programs, the, university, of, southern, california, was, one, of, the, first, schools, in, the, us, to, offer, a, phd, program, focusing, on, the, field, further, multiple, master, s, degree, programs, exist, such, as, that, of, the, indiana, state, university, who, offer, msc, and, ma, programs, other, masters, level, qualifications, include, the, msc, and, master, of, research, mres, degrees, offered, by, the, university, of, hull, in, collaboration, with, the, national, examination, board, in, occupational, safety, and, health, nebosh, graduate, programs, are, designed, to, train, educators, as, well, as, high, level, practitioners, many, osh, generalists, focus, on, undergraduate, studies, programs, within, schools, such, as, that, of, the, university, of, north, carolina, s, online, bsc, in, environmental, health, and, safety, fill, a, large, majority, of, hygienist, needs, however, smaller, companies, often, do, not, have, full, time, safety, specialists, on, staff, thus, they, appoint, a, current, employee, to, the, responsibility, individuals, finding, themselves, in, positions, such, as, these, or, for, those, enhancing, marketability, in, the, job, search, and, promotion, arena, may, seek, out, a, credit, certificate, program, for, example, the, university, of, connecticut, s, online, osh, certificate, provides, students, familiarity, with, overarching, concepts, through, a, 15, credit, 5, course, program, programs, such, as, these, are, often, adequate, tools, in, building, a, strong, educational, platform, for, new, safety, managers, with, a, minimal, outlay, of, time, and, money, further, most, hygienists, seek, certification, by, organizations, that, train, in, specific, areas, of, concentration, focusing, on, isolated, workplace, hazards, the, american, society, of, safety, professionals, assp, board, for, global, ehs, credentialing, bgc, and, american, industrial, hygiene, association, aiha, offer, individual, certificates, on, many, different, subjects, from, forklift, operation, to, waste, disposal, and, are, the, chief, facilitators, of, continuing, education, in, the, osh, sector, in, the, us, the, training, of, safety, professionals, is, supported, by, niosh, through, their, niosh, education, and, research, centers, in, the, uk, both, nebosh, and, the, institution, of, occupational, safety, and, health, iosh, develop, health, and, safety, qualifications, and, courses, which, cater, to, a, mixture, of, industries, and, levels, of, study, although, both, organizations, are, based, in, the, uk, their, qualifications, are, recognized, and, studied, internationally, as, they, are, delivered, through, their, own, global, networks, of, approved, providers, the, health, and, safety, executive, has, also, developed, health, and, safety, qualifications, in, collaboration, with, the, nebosh, in, australia, training, in, osh, is, available, at, the, vocational, education, and, training, level, and, at, university, undergraduate, and, postgraduate, level, such, university, courses, may, be, accredited, by, an, accreditation, board, of, the, safety, institute, of, australia, the, institute, has, produced, a, body, of, knowledge, which, it, considers, is, required, by, a, generalist, safety, and, health, professional, and, offers, a, professional, qualification, the, australian, institute, of, health, and, safety, has, instituted, the, national, eric, wigglesworth, ohs, education, medal, to, recognize, achievement, in, osh, doctorate, education, one, form, of, training, delivered, in, the, workplace, is, known, as, toolbox, talk, according, to, the, uk, s, health, and, safety, executive, a, toolbox, talk, is, a, short, presentation, to, the, workforce, on, a, single, aspect, of, health, and, safety, such, talks, are, often, used, especially, in, the, construction, industry, by, site, supervisors, frontline, managers, and, owners, of, small, construction, firms, to, prepare, and, deliver, advice, on, matters, of, health, safety, and, the, environment, and, to, obtain, feedback, from, the, workforce, virtual, reality, is, a, novel, tool, to, deliver, safety, training, in, many, fields, some, applications, have, been, developed, and, tested, especially, for, fire, and, construction, safety, training, preliminary, findings, seem, to, support, that, virtual, reality, is, more, effective, than, traditional, training, in, knowledge, retention, on, an, international, scale, the, world, health, organization, who, and, the, international, labour, organization, ilo, have, begun, focusing, on, labor, environments, in, developing, nations, with, projects, such, as, healthy, cities, many, of, these, developing, countries, are, stuck, in, a, situation, in, which, their, relative, lack, of, resources, to, invest, in, osh, leads, to, increased, costs, due, to, work, related, illnesses, and, accidents, the, ilo, estimates, that, work, related, illness, and, accidents, cost, up, to, 10, of, gdp, in, latin, america, compared, with, just, 2, 6, to, 3, 8, in, the, eu, there, is, continued, use, of, asbestos, a, notorious, hazard, in, some, developing, countries, so, asbestos, related, disease, is, expected, to, continue, to, be, a, significant, problem, well, into, the, future, there, are, several, broad, aspects, of, artificial, intelligence, ai, that, may, give, rise, to, specific, hazards, many, hazards, of, ai, are, psychosocial, in, nature, due, to, its, potential, to, cause, changes, in, work, organization, for, example, ai, is, expected, to, lead, to, changes, in, the, skills, required, of, workers, requiring, retraining, of, existing, workers, flexibility, and, openness, to, change, increased, monitoring, may, lead, to, micromanagement, or, perception, of, surveillance, and, thus, to, workplace, stress, there, is, also, the, risk, of, people, being, forced, to, work, at, a, robot, s, pace, or, to, monitor, robot, performance, at, nonstandard, hours, additionally, algorithms, may, show, algorithmic, bias, through, being, trained, on, past, decisions, may, mimic, undesirable, human, biases, for, example, past, discriminatory, hiring, and, firing, practices, some, approaches, to, accident, analysis, may, be, biased, to, safeguard, a, technological, system, and, its, developers, by, assigning, blame, to, the, individual, human, operator, instead, physical, hazards, in, the, form, of, human, robot, collisions, may, arise, from, robots, using, ai, especially, collaborative, robots, cobots, cobots, are, intended, to, operate, in, close, proximity, to, humans, which, makes, it, impossible, to, implement, the, common, hazard, control, of, isolating, the, robot, using, fences, or, other, barriers, which, is, widely, used, for, traditional, industrial, robots, automated, guided, vehicles, are, a, type, of, cobot, in, common, use, often, as, forklifts, or, pallet, jacks, in, warehouses, or, factories, both, applications, and, hazards, arising, from, ai, can, be, considered, as, part, of, existing, frameworks, for, occupational, health, and, safety, risk, management, as, with, all, hazards, risk, identification, is, most, effective, and, least, costly, when, done, in, the, design, phase, ai, in, common, with, other, computational, technologies, requires, cybersecurity, measures, to, stop, software, breaches, and, intrusions, as, well, as, information, privacy, measures, communication, and, transparency, with, workers, about, data, usage, is, a, control, for, psychosocial, hazards, arising, from, security, and, privacy, issues, workplace, health, surveillance, the, collection, and, analysis, of, health, data, on, workers, is, challenging, for, ai, because, labor, data, are, often, reported, in, aggregate, does, not, provide, breakdowns, between, different, types, of, work, and, is, focused, on, economic, data, such, as, wages, and, employment, rates, rather, than, skill, content, of, jobs, the, national, institute, of, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, national, occupational, research, agenda, manufacturing, council, established, an, externally, lead, covid, 19, workgroup, to, provide, exposure, control, information, specific, to, working, in, manufacturing, environments, the, workgroup, identified, disseminating, information, most, relevant, to, manufacturing, workplaces, as, a, priority, and, that, would, include, providing, content, in, wikipedia, this, includes, evidence, based, practices, for, infection, control, plans, and, communication, tools, nanotechnology, is, an, example, of, a, new, relatively, unstudied, technology, a, swiss, survey, of, 138, companies, using, or, producing, nanoparticulate, matter, in, 2006, resulted, in, forty, completed, questionnaires, sixty, five, per, cent, of, respondent, companies, stated, they, did, not, have, a, formal, risk, assessment, process, for, dealing, with, nanoparticulate, matter, nanotechnology, already, presents, new, issues, for, osh, professionals, that, will, only, become, more, difficult, as, nanostructures, become, more, complex, the, size, of, the, particles, renders, most, containment, and, personal, protective, equipment, ineffective, the, toxicology, values, for, macro, sized, industrial, substances, are, rendered, inaccurate, due, to, the, unique, nature, of, nanoparticulate, matter, as, nanoparticulate, matter, decreases, in, size, its, relative, surface, area, increases, dramatically, increasing, any, catalytic, effect, or, chemical, reactivity, substantially, versus, the, known, value, for, the, macro, substance, this, presents, a, new, set, of, challenges, in, the, near, future, to, rethink, contemporary, measures, to, safeguard, the, health, and, welfare, of, employees, against, a, nanoparticulate, substance, that, most, conventional, controls, have, not, been, designed, to, manage, occupational, health, inequalities, refer, to, differences, in, occupational, injuries, and, illnesses, that, are, closely, linked, with, demographic, social, cultural, economic, and, or, political, factors, although, many, advances, have, been, made, to, rectify, gaps, in, occupational, health, within, the, past, half, century, still, many, persist, due, to, the, complex, overlapping, of, occupational, health, and, social, factors, there, are, three, main, areas, of, research, on, occupational, health, inequities, immigrant, worker, populations, often, are, at, greater, risk, for, workplace, injuries, and, fatalities, for, example, within, the, united, states, immigrant, mexican, workers, have, one, of, the, highest, rates, of, fatal, workplace, injuries, out, of, all, of, the, working, population, statistics, like, these, are, explained, through, a, combination, of, social, structural, and, physical, aspects, of, the, workplace, these, workers, struggle, to, access, safety, information, and, resources, in, their, native, languages, because, of, lack, of, social, and, political, inclusion, in, addition, to, linguistically, tailored, interventions, it, is, also, critical, for, the, interventions, to, be, culturally, appropriate, those, residing, in, a, country, to, work, without, a, visa, or, other, formal, authorization, may, also, not, have, access, to, legal, resources, and, recourse, that, are, designed, to, protect, most, workers, health, and, safety, organizations, that, rely, on, whistleblowers, instead, of, their, own, independent, inspections, may, be, especially, at, risk, of, having, an, incomplete, picture, of, worker, health, comprehensive, employment, and, training, act
