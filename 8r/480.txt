stingrays, are, a, group, of, sea, rays, a, type, of, cartilaginous, fish, they, are, classified, in, the, suborder, myliobatoidei, of, the, order, myliobatiformes, and, consist, of, eight, families, hexatrygonidae, sixgill, stingray, plesiobatidae, deepwater, stingray, urolophidae, stingarees, urotrygonidae, round, rays, dasyatidae, whiptail, stingrays, potamotrygonidae, river, stingrays, gymnuridae, butterfly, rays, and, myliobatidae, eagle, rays, there, are, about, 220, known, stingray, species, organized, into, 29, genera, stingrays, are, common, in, coastal, tropical, and, subtropical, marine, waters, throughout, the, world, some, species, such, as, the, thorntail, stingray, dasyatis, thetidis, are, found, in, warmer, temperate, oceans, and, others, such, as, the, deepwater, stingray, plesiobatis, daviesi, are, found, in, the, deep, ocean, the, river, stingrays, and, a, number, of, whiptail, stingrays, such, as, the, niger, stingray, fontitrygon, garouaensis, are, restricted, to, fresh, water, most, myliobatoids, are, demersal, inhabiting, the, next, to, lowest, zone, in, the, water, column, but, some, such, as, the, pelagic, stingray, and, the, eagle, rays, are, pelagic, stingray, species, are, progressively, becoming, threatened, or, vulnerable, to, extinction, particularly, as, the, consequence, of, unregulated, fishing, as, of, 2013, 45, species, have, been, listed, as, vulnerable, or, endangered, by, the, iucn, the, status, of, some, other, species, is, poorly, known, leading, to, their, being, listed, as, data, deficient, stingrays, diverged, from, their, closest, relatives, the, panrays, during, the, late, jurassic, period, and, diversified, over, the, course, of, the, cretaceous, into, the, different, extant, families, today, the, earliest, stingrays, appear, to, have, been, benthic, with, the, ancestors, of, the, eagle, rays, becoming, pelagic, during, the, early, late, cretaceous, permineralized, stingray, teeth, have, been, found, in, sedimentary, deposits, around, the, world, as, far, back, as, the, early, cretaceous, the, oldest, known, stingray, taxon, is, dasyatis, speetonensis, from, the, hauterivian, of, england, whose, teeth, most, closely, resemble, that, of, the, extant, sixgill, stingray, hexatrygon, although, stingray, teeth, are, rare, on, sea, bottoms, compared, to, the, similar, shark, teeth, scuba, divers, searching, for, the, latter, do, encounter, the, teeth, of, stingrays, full, body, stingray, fossils, are, very, rare, but, are, known, from, certain, lagerst, tte, that, preserve, soft, bodied, animals, the, extinct, cyclobatis, of, the, cretaceous, of, lebanon, is, thought, to, be, a, skate, that, had, convergently, evolved, a, highly, stingray, like, body, plan, although, its, exact, taxonomic, placement, is, still, uncertain, true, stingray, fossils, become, more, common, in, the, eocene, with, the, extinct, freshwater, stingrays, heliobatis, and, asterotrygon, known, from, the, green, river, formation, a, diversity, of, stingray, fossils, is, known, from, the, eocene, monte, bolca, formation, from, italy, including, the, early, stingaree, arechia, as, well, as, dasyomyliobatis, which, is, thought, to, represent, a, transitional, form, between, stingrays, and, eagle, rays, and, the, highly, unusual, lessiniabatis, which, had, an, extremely, short, and, slender, tail, with, no, sting, the, mouth, of, the, stingray, is, located, on, the, ventral, side, of, the, vertebrate, stingrays, exhibit, hyostylic, jaw, suspension, which, means, that, the, mandibular, arch, is, only, suspended, by, an, articulation, with, the, hyomandibula, this, type, of, suspensions, allows, for, the, upper, jaw, to, have, high, mobility, and, protrude, outward, the, teeth, are, modified, placoid, scales, that, are, regularly, shed, and, replaced, in, general, the, teeth, have, a, root, implanted, within, the, connective, tissue, and, a, visible, portion, of, the, tooth, is, large, and, flat, allowing, them, to, crush, the, bodies, of, hard, shelled, prey, male, stingrays, display, sexual, dimorphism, by, developing, cusps, or, pointed, ends, to, some, of, their, teeth, during, mating, season, some, stingray, species, fully, change, their, tooth, morphology, which, then, returns, to, baseline, during, non, mating, seasons, spiracles, are, small, openings, that, allow, some, fish, and, amphibians, to, breathe, stingray, spiracles, are, openings, just, behind, its, eyes, the, respiratory, system, of, stingrays, is, complicated, by, having, two, separate, ways, to, take, in, water, to, use, the, oxygen, most, of, the, time, stingrays, take, in, water, using, their, mouth, and, then, send, the, water, through, the, gills, for, gas, exchange, this, is, efficient, but, the, mouth, cannot, be, used, when, hunting, because, the, stingrays, bury, themselves, in, the, ocean, sediment, and, wait, for, prey, to, swim, by, so, the, stingray, switches, to, using, its, spiracles, with, the, spiracles, they, can, draw, water, free, from, sediment, directly, into, their, gills, for, gas, exchange, these, alternate, ventilation, organs, are, less, efficient, than, the, mouth, since, spiracles, are, unable, to, pull, the, same, volume, of, water, however, it, is, enough, when, the, stingray, is, quietly, waiting, to, ambush, its, prey, the, flattened, bodies, of, stingrays, allow, them, to, effectively, conceal, themselves, in, their, environments, stingrays, do, this, by, agitating, the, sand, and, hiding, beneath, it, because, their, eyes, are, on, top, of, their, bodies, and, their, mouths, on, the, undersides, stingrays, cannot, see, their, prey, after, capture, instead, they, use, smell, and, electroreceptors, ampullae, of, lorenzini, similar, to, those, of, sharks, stingrays, settle, on, the, bottom, while, feeding, often, leaving, only, their, eyes, and, tails, visible, coral, reefs, are, favorite, feeding, grounds, and, are, usually, shared, with, sharks, during, high, tide, during, the, breeding, season, males, of, various, stingray, species, such, as, the, round, stingray, urobatis, halleri, may, rely, on, their, ampullae, of, lorenzini, to, sense, certain, electrical, signals, given, off, by, mature, females, before, potential, copulation, when, a, male, is, courting, a, female, he, follows, her, closely, biting, at, her, pectoral, disc, he, then, places, one, of, his, two, claspers, into, her, valve, reproductive, ray, behaviors, are, associated, with, their, behavioral, endocrinology, for, example, in, species, such, as, the, atlantic, stingray, hypanus, sabinus, social, groups, are, formed, first, then, the, sexes, display, complex, courtship, behaviors, that, end, in, pair, copulation, which, is, similar, to, the, species, urobatis, halleri, furthermore, their, mating, period, is, one, of, the, longest, recorded, in, elasmobranch, fish, individuals, are, known, to, mate, for, seven, months, before, the, females, ovulate, in, march, during, this, time, the, male, stingrays, experience, increased, levels, of, androgen, hormones, which, has, been, linked, to, its, prolonged, mating, periods, the, behavior, expressed, among, males, and, females, during, specific, parts, of, this, period, involves, aggressive, social, interactions, frequently, the, males, trail, females, with, their, snout, near, the, female, vent, then, proceed, to, bite, the, female, on, her, fins, and, her, body, although, this, mating, behavior, is, similar, to, the, species, urobatis, halleri, differences, can, be, seen, in, the, particular, actions, of, hypanus, sabinus, seasonal, elevated, levels, of, serum, androgens, coincide, with, the, expressed, aggressive, behavior, which, led, to, the, proposal, that, androgen, steroids, start, indorse, and, maintain, aggressive, sexual, behaviors, in, the, male, rays, for, this, species, which, drives, the, prolonged, mating, season, similarly, concise, elevations, of, serum, androgens, in, females, has, been, connected, to, increased, aggression, and, improvement, in, mate, choice, when, their, androgen, steroid, levels, are, elevated, they, are, able, to, improve, their, mate, choice, by, quickly, fleeing, from, tenacious, males, when, undergoing, ovulation, succeeding, impregnation, this, ability, affects, the, paternity, of, their, offspring, by, refusing, less, qualified, mates, stingrays, are, ovoviviparous, bearing, live, young, in, litters, of, five, to, thirteen, during, this, period, the, female, s, behavior, transitions, to, support, of, her, future, offspring, females, hold, the, embryos, in, the, womb, without, a, placenta, instead, the, embryos, absorb, nutrients, from, a, yolk, sac, and, after, the, sac, is, depleted, the, mother, provides, uterine, milk, after, birth, the, offspring, generally, disassociate, from, the, mother, and, swim, away, having, been, born, with, the, instinctual, abilities, to, protect, and, feed, themselves, in, a, very, small, number, of, species, like, the, giant, freshwater, stingray, urogymnus, polylepis, the, mother, cares, for, her, young, by, having, them, swim, with, her, until, they, are, one, third, of, her, size, at, the, sea, life, london, aquarium, two, female, stingrays, delivered, seven, baby, stingrays, although, the, mothers, have, not, been, near, a, male, for, two, years, this, suggests, some, species, of, rays, can, store, sperm, then, give, birth, when, they, deem, conditions, to, be, suitable, the, stingray, uses, its, paired, pectoral, fins, for, moving, around, this, is, in, contrast, to, sharks, and, most, other, fish, which, get, most, of, their, swimming, power, from, a, single, caudal, tail, fin, stingray, pectoral, fin, locomotion, can, be, divided, into, two, categories, undulatory, and, oscillatory, stingrays, that, use, undulatory, locomotion, have, shorter, thicker, fins, for, slower, motile, movements, in, benthic, areas, longer, thinner, pectoral, fins, make, for, faster, speeds, in, oscillation, mobility, in, pelagic, zones, visually, distinguishable, oscillation, has, less, than, one, wave, going, opposed, to, undulation, having, more, than, one, wave, at, all, times, stingrays, use, a, wide, range, of, feeding, strategies, some, have, specialized, jaws, that, allow, them, to, crush, hard, mollusk, shells, whereas, others, use, external, mouth, structures, called, cephalic, lobes, to, guide, plankton, into, their, oral, cavity, benthic, stingrays, those, that, reside, on, the, sea, floor, are, ambush, hunters, they, wait, until, prey, comes, near, then, use, a, strategy, called, tenting, with, pectoral, fins, pressed, against, the, substrate, the, ray, will, raise, its, head, generating, a, suction, force, that, pulls, the, prey, underneath, the, body, this, form, of, whole, body, suction, is, analogous, to, the, buccal, suction, feeding, performed, by, ray, finned, fish, stingrays, exhibit, a, wide, range, of, colors, and, patterns, on, their, dorsal, surface, to, help, them, camouflage, with, the, sandy, bottom, some, stingrays, can, even, change, color, over, the, course, of, several, days, to, adjust, to, new, habitats, since, their, mouths, are, on, the, underside, of, their, bodies, they, catch, their, prey, then, crush, and, eat, with, their, powerful, jaws, like, its, shark, relatives, the, stingray, is, outfitted, with, electrical, sensors, called, ampullae, of, lorenzini, located, around, the, stingray, s, mouth, these, organs, sense, the, natural, electrical, charges, of, potential, prey, many, rays, have, jaw, teeth, to, enable, them, to, crush, mollusks, such, as, clams, oysters, and, mussels, most, stingrays, feed, primarily, on, mollusks, crustaceans, and, occasionally, on, small, fish, freshwater, stingrays, in, the, amazon, feed, on, insects, and, break, down, their, tough, exoskeletons, with, mammal, like, chewing, motions, large, pelagic, rays, like, the, manta, use, ram, feeding, to, consume, vast, quantities, of, plankton, and, have, been, seen, swimming, in, acrobatic, patterns, through, plankton, patches, stingrays, are, not, usually, aggressive, and, ordinarily, attack, humans, only, when, provoked, such, as, when, they, are, accidentally, stepped, on, stingrays, can, have, one, two, or, three, blades, contact, with, the, spinal, blade, or, blades, causes, local, trauma, from, the, cut, itself, pain, swelling, muscle, cramps, from, the, venom, and, later, may, result, in, infection, from, bacteria, or, fungi, the, injury, is, very, painful, but, rarely, life, threatening, unless, the, stinger, pierces, a, vital, area, the, blade, is, often, deeply, barbed, and, usually, breaks, off, in, the, wound, surgery, may, be, required, to, remove, the, fragments, fatal, stings, are, very, rare, the, death, of, steve, irwin, in, 2006, was, only, the, second, recorded, in, australian, waters, since, 1945, the, stinger, penetrated, his, thoracic, wall, and, pierced, his, heart, causing, massive, trauma, and, bleeding, the, venom, of, the, stingray, has, been, relatively, unstudied, due, to, the, mixture, of, venomous, tissue, secretions, cells, and, mucous, membrane, cell, products, that, occurs, upon, secretion, from, the, spinal, blade, the, spine, is, covered, with, the, epidermal, skin, layer, during, secretion, the, venom, penetrates, the, epidermis, and, mixes, with, the, mucus, to, release, the, venom, on, its, victim, typically, other, venomous, organisms, create, and, store, their, venom, in, a, gland, the, stingray, is, notable, in, that, it, stores, its, venom, within, tissue, cells, the, toxins, that, have, been, confirmed, to, be, within, the, venom, are, cystatins, peroxiredoxin, and, galectin, galectin, induces, cell, death, in, its, victims, and, cystatins, inhibit, defense, enzymes, in, humans, these, toxins, lead, to, increased, blood, flow, in, the, superficial, capillaries, and, cell, death, despite, the, number, of, cells, and, toxins, that, are, within, the, stingray, there, is, little, relative, energy, required, to, produce, and, store, the, venom, the, venom, is, produced, and, stored, in, the, secretory, cells, of, the, vertebral, column, at, the, mid, distal, region, these, secretory, cells, are, housed, within, the, ventrolateral, grooves, of, the, spine, the, cells, of, both, marine, and, freshwater, stingrays, are, round, and, contain, a, great, amount, of, granule, filled, cytoplasm, the, stinging, cells, of, marine, stingrays, are, located, only, within, these, lateral, grooves, of, the, stinger, the, stinging, cells, of, freshwater, stingray, branch, out, beyond, the, lateral, grooves, to, cover, a, larger, surface, area, along, the, entire, blade, due, to, this, large, area, and, an, increased, number, of, proteins, within, the, cells, the, venom, of, freshwater, stingrays, has, a, greater, toxicity, than, that, of, marine, stingrays, rays, are, edible, and, may, be, caught, as, food, using, fishing, lines, or, spears, stingray, recipes, can, be, found, in, many, coastal, areas, worldwide, for, example, in, malaysia, and, singapore, stingray, is, commonly, grilled, over, charcoal, then, served, with, spicy, sambal, sauce, in, goa, and, other, indian, states, it, is, sometimes, used, as, part, of, spicy, curries, generally, the, most, prized, parts, of, the, stingray, are, the, wings, the, cheek, the, area, surrounding, the, eyes, and, the, liver, the, rest, of, the, ray, is, considered, too, rubbery, to, have, any, culinary, uses, stingrays, are, usually, very, docile, and, curious, their, usual, reaction, being, to, flee, any, disturbance, but, they, sometimes, brush, their, fins, past, any, new, object, they, encounter, nevertheless, certain, larger, species, may, be, more, aggressive, and, should, be, approached, with, caution, as, the, stingray, s, defensive, reflex, use, of, its, venomous, stinger, may, result, in, serious, injury, or, death, the, skin, of, the, ray, is, used, as, an, under, layer, for, the, cord, or, leather, wrap, known, as, samegawa, in, japanese, on, japanese, swords, due, to, its, hard, rough, texture, that, keeps, the, braided, wrap, from, sliding, on, the, handle, during, use, several, ethnological, sections, in, museums, such, as, the, british, museum, display, arrowheads, and, spearheads, made, of, stingray, stingers, used, in, micronesia, and, elsewhere, henry, de, monfreid, stated, in, his, books, that, before, world, war, ii, in, the, horn, of, africa, whips, were, made, from, the, tails, of, big, stingrays, and, these, devices, inflicted, cruel, cuts, so, in, aden, the, british, forbade, their, use, on, women, and, slaves, in, former, spanish, colonies, a, stingray, is, called, raya, l, tigo, whip, ray, some, stingray, species, are, commonly, seen, in, public, aquarium, exhibits, and, more, recently, in, home, aquaria
