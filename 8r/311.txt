wildlife, conservation, refers, to, the, practice, of, protecting, wild, species, and, their, habitats, in, order, to, maintain, healthy, wildlife, species, or, populations, and, to, restore, protect, or, enhance, natural, ecosystems, major, threats, to, wildlife, include, habitat, destruction, degradation, fragmentation, overexploitation, poaching, pollution, climate, change, and, the, illegal, wildlife, trade, the, iucn, estimates, that, 42, 100, species, of, the, ones, assessed, are, at, risk, for, extinction, expanding, to, all, existing, species, a, 2019, un, report, on, biodiversity, put, this, estimate, even, higher, at, a, million, species, it, is, also, being, acknowledged, that, an, increasing, number, of, ecosystems, on, earth, containing, endangered, species, are, disappearing, to, address, these, issues, there, have, been, both, national, and, international, governmental, efforts, to, preserve, earth, s, wildlife, prominent, conservation, agreements, include, the, 1973, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, of, wild, fauna, and, flora, cites, and, the, 1992, convention, on, biological, diversity, cbd, there, are, also, numerous, nongovernmental, organizations, ngo, s, dedicated, to, conservation, such, as, the, nature, conservancy, world, wildlife, fund, and, conservation, international, habitat, destruction, decreases, the, number, of, places, where, wildlife, can, live, in, habitat, fragmentation, breaks, up, a, continuous, tract, of, habitat, often, dividing, large, wildlife, populations, into, several, smaller, ones, human, caused, habitat, loss, and, fragmentation, are, primary, drivers, of, species, declines, and, extinctions, key, examples, of, human, induced, habitat, loss, include, deforestation, agricultural, expansion, and, urbanization, habitat, destruction, and, fragmentation, can, increase, the, vulnerability, of, wildlife, populations, by, reducing, the, space, and, resources, available, to, them, and, by, increasing, the, likelihood, of, conflict, with, humans, moreover, destruction, and, fragmentation, create, smaller, habitats, smaller, habitats, support, smaller, populations, and, smaller, populations, are, more, likely, to, go, extinct, the, covid, 19, pandemic, has, caused, a, significant, shift, in, human, behavior, resulting, in, mandatory, and, voluntary, limitations, on, movement, as, a, result, people, have, started, utilizing, green, spaces, more, frequently, which, were, previously, habitats, for, wildlife, unfortunately, this, increased, human, activity, has, caused, destruction, to, the, natural, habitat, of, various, species, deforestation, is, the, clearing, and, cutting, down, forests, on, purpose, deforestation, is, a, cause, of, human, induced, habitat, action, destruction, by, cutting, down, habitats, of, different, species, in, the, process, of, removing, trees, deforestation, is, often, done, for, several, reasons, often, for, either, agricultural, purposes, or, for, logging, which, is, the, obtainment, of, timber, and, wood, for, use, in, construction, or, fuel, deforestation, causes, many, threats, to, wildlife, as, it, not, only, causes, habitat, destruction, for, the, many, animals, that, survive, in, forests, as, more, than, 80, of, the, world, s, species, live, in, forests, but, also, leads, to, further, climate, change, deforestation, is, a, main, concern, in, the, tropical, forests, of, the, world, tropical, forests, like, the, amazon, are, home, to, the, most, biodiversity, out, of, any, other, biome, making, deforestation, there, an, even, more, prevalent, issue, especially, in, populated, areas, as, in, these, areas, deforestation, leads, to, habitat, destruction, and, the, endangerment, of, many, species, in, one, area, some, policies, have, been, enacted, to, attempt, to, stop, deforestation, in, different, parts, of, the, world, like, the, wilderness, act, of, 1964, which, designated, specific, areas, wilderness, to, be, protected, overexploitation, is, the, harvesting, of, animals, and, plants, at, a, rate, that, s, faster, than, the, species, ability, to, recover, while, often, associated, with, overfishing, overexploitation, can, apply, to, many, groups, including, mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and, plants, the, danger, of, overexploitation, is, that, if, too, many, of, a, species, offspring, are, taken, then, the, species, may, not, recover, for, example, overfishing, of, top, marine, predatory, fish, like, tuna, and, salmon, over, the, past, century, has, led, to, a, decline, in, fish, sizes, as, well, as, fish, numbers, poaching, for, illegal, wildlife, trading, is, a, major, threat, to, certain, species, particularly, endangered, ones, whose, status, makes, them, economically, valuable, such, species, include, many, large, mammals, like, african, elephants, tigers, and, rhinoceros, traded, for, their, tusks, skins, and, horns, respectively, less, well, known, targets, of, poaching, include, the, harvest, of, protected, plants, and, animals, for, souvenirs, food, skins, pets, and, more, poaching, causes, already, small, populations, to, decline, even, further, as, hunters, tend, to, target, threatened, and, endangered, species, because, of, their, rarity, and, large, profits, as, carbon, dioxide, levels, increase, concentration, in, the, atmosphere, they, increase, in, the, ocean, as, well, typically, the, ocean, will, absorb, carbon, from, the, atmosphere, where, it, can, be, sequestered, in, the, deep, ocean, and, sea, floor, this, is, a, process, called, the, biological, pump, increased, carbon, dioxide, emissions, and, increased, stratification, which, slows, the, biological, pump, decrease, the, ocean, ph, making, it, more, acidic, calcifying, organisms, such, as, coral, are, especially, susceptible, to, decreased, ph, resulting, in, mass, bleaching, events, inevitably, destroying, a, habitat, for, many, of, coral, s, diverse, inhabitants, research, conducted, through, methods, such, as, coral, fossils, and, ancient, ice, core, carbon, analysis, suggests, ocean, acidification, has, occurred, in, the, geological, past, more, likely, at, a, slower, pace, and, correlate, with, past, extinction, events, culling, is, the, deliberate, and, selective, killing, of, wildlife, by, governments, for, various, purposes, an, example, of, this, is, shark, culling, in, which, shark, control, programs, in, queensland, and, new, south, wales, in, australia, have, killed, thousands, of, sharks, as, well, as, turtles, dolphins, whales, and, other, marine, life, the, queensland, shark, control, program, alone, has, killed, about, 50, 000, sharks, it, has, also, killed, more, than, 84, 000, marine, animals, there, are, also, examples, of, population, culling, in, the, united, states, such, as, bison, in, montana, and, swans, geese, and, deer, in, new, york, and, other, places, a, wide, range, of, pollutants, negatively, impact, wildlife, health, for, some, pollutants, simple, exposure, is, enough, to, do, damage, e, g, pesticides, for, others, its, through, inhaling, e, g, air, pollutants, or, ingesting, it, e, g, toxic, metals, pollutants, affect, different, species, in, different, ways, so, a, pollutant, that, is, bad, for, one, might, not, affect, another, humans, are, responsible, for, present, day, climate, change, currently, changing, earth, s, environmental, conditions, it, is, related, to, some, of, the, aforementioned, threats, to, wildlife, like, habitat, destruction, and, pollution, rising, temperatures, melting, ice, sheets, changes, in, precipitation, patterns, severe, droughts, more, frequent, heat, waves, storm, intensification, ocean, acidification, and, rising, sea, levels, are, some, of, the, effects, of, climate, change, phenomena, like, droughts, wildfires, heatwaves, intense, storms, ocean, acidification, and, rising, sea, levels, directly, lead, to, habitat, destruction, for, example, longer, dry, seasons, warmer, springs, and, dry, soil, has, been, observed, to, increase, the, length, of, wildfire, season, in, forests, shrublands, and, grasslands, increased, severity, and, longevity, of, wildfires, can, completely, wipe, out, entire, ecosystems, causing, them, to, take, decades, to, fully, recover, wildfires, are, a, prime, example, of, the, direct, negative, effect, climate, change, has, on, wildlife, and, ecosystems, meanwhile, a, warming, climate, fluctuating, precipitation, and, changing, weather, patterns, will, impact, species, ranges, overall, the, effects, of, climate, change, increase, stress, on, ecosystems, and, species, unable, to, cope, with, the, rapidly, changing, conditions, will, go, extinct, while, modern, climate, change, is, caused, by, humans, past, climate, change, events, occurred, naturally, and, have, led, to, extinctions, the, illegal, wildlife, trade, is, the, illegal, trading, of, plants, and, wildlife, this, illegal, trading, is, worth, an, estimate, of, 7, 23, billion, and, an, annual, trade, of, around, 100, million, plants, and, animals, in, 2021, it, was, found, that, this, trade, has, caused, a, 60, decline, in, species, abundance, and, 80, for, endangered, species, this, trade, can, be, devastating, to, both, humans, and, animals, it, has, the, capacity, to, spread, zoonotic, diseases, to, humans, as, well, as, contribute, to, local, extinction, the, pathogens, to, humans, may, be, spread, through, small, animal, vectors, like, ticks, or, through, ingestion, of, food, and, water, extinction, can, be, caused, due, to, non, native, species, being, introduced, that, become, invasive, an, example, of, how, this, may, happen, is, through, by, catch, these, new, species, will, outcompete, the, native, species, and, take, over, therefore, causing, the, local, or, global, extinction, of, a, species, due, to, the, fittest, animals, in, the, species, being, hunted, or, poached, the, less, fit, organisms, will, mate, causing, less, fitness, in, the, generations, to, come, in, addition, to, species, fitness, being, lowered, and, therefore, endangering, species, the, illegal, wildlife, trade, has, ecological, costs, sex, ratio, balances, may, be, tipped, or, reproduction, rates, are, slowed, which, can, be, detrimental, to, vulnerable, species, the, recovery, of, these, populations, may, take, longer, due, to, the, reproduction, rates, being, slower, the, wildlife, trade, also, causes, issues, for, natural, resources, that, people, use, in, their, everyday, lives, ecotourism, is, how, some, people, bring, in, money, to, their, homes, and, with, depleting, the, wildlife, this, may, be, a, factor, in, taking, away, jobs, illegal, wildlife, trade, has, also, become, normalized, through, various, social, media, outlets, there, are, tiktok, accounts, that, have, gone, viral, for, their, depiction, of, exotic, pets, such, as, various, monkey, and, bird, species, these, accounts, show, a, cute, and, fun, side, of, owning, exotic, pets, therefore, indirectly, encouraging, illegal, wildlife, trade, on, march, 30, 2021, tiktik, joined, the, coalition, to, end, wildlife, trafficking, online, they, along, with, other, big, social, media, companies, work, to, protect, species, from, illegal, harmful, trade, online, research, has, shown, that, machine, learning, can, filter, through, social, media, posts, to, identify, indications, of, illegal, wildlife, trade, this, filtration, system, is, able, to, search, for, keywords, pictures, and, phrases, that, indicate, illegal, wildlife, trade, and, report, it, it, is, estimated, that, because, of, human, activities, current, species, extinction, rates, are, about, 1000, times, greater, than, the, background, extinction, rate, the, normal, extinction, rate, that, occurs, without, additional, influence, according, to, the, iucn, out, of, all, species, assessed, over, 42, 100, are, at, risk, of, extinction, and, should, be, under, conservation, of, these, 25, are, mammals, 14, are, birds, and, 40, are, amphibians, however, because, not, all, species, have, been, assessed, these, numbers, could, be, even, higher, a, 2019, un, report, assessing, global, biodiversity, extrapolated, iucn, data, to, all, species, and, estimated, that, 1, million, species, worldwide, could, face, extinction, conservation, of, a, select, species, are, often, prioritized, on, several, factors, which, include, significant, economic, and, ecological, value, as, well, as, desirability, or, attractiveness, yet, because, resources, are, limited, sometimes, it, is, not, possible, to, give, all, species, that, need, conservation, due, consideration, the, leatherback, sea, turtle, dermochelys, coriacea, is, the, largest, turtle, in, the, world, is, the, only, turtle, without, a, hard, shell, and, is, endangered, it, is, found, throughout, the, central, pacific, and, atlantic, oceans, but, several, of, its, populations, are, in, decline, across, the, globe, though, not, all, the, leatherback, sea, turtle, faces, numerous, threats, including, being, caught, as, bycatch, harvest, of, its, eggs, loss, of, nesting, habitats, and, marine, pollution, in, the, us, where, the, leatherback, is, listed, under, the, endangered, species, act, measures, to, protect, it, include, reducing, bycatch, captures, through, fishing, gear, modifications, monitoring, and, protecting, its, habitat, both, nesting, beaches, and, in, the, ocean, and, reducing, damage, from, marine, pollution, there, is, currently, an, international, effort, to, protect, the, leatherback, sea, turtle, habitat, conservation, is, the, practice, of, protecting, a, habitat, in, order, to, protect, the, species, within, it, this, is, sometimes, preferable, to, focusing, on, a, single, species, especially, if, the, species, in, question, has, very, specific, habitat, requirements, or, lives, in, a, habitat, with, many, other, endangered, species, the, latter, is, often, true, of, species, living, in, biodiversity, hotspots, which, are, areas, of, the, world, with, an, exceptionally, high, concentration, of, endemic, species, species, found, nowhere, else, in, the, world, many, of, these, hotspots, are, in, the, tropics, mainly, tropical, forests, like, the, amazon, habitat, conservation, is, usually, carried, out, by, setting, aside, protected, areas, like, national, parks, or, nature, reserves, even, when, an, area, isn, t, made, into, a, park, or, reserve, it, can, still, be, monitored, and, maintained, the, red, cockaded, woodpecker, picoides, borealis, is, an, endangered, bird, in, the, southeastern, us, it, only, lives, in, longleaf, pine, savannas, which, are, maintained, by, wildfires, in, mature, pine, forests, today, it, is, a, rare, habitat, as, fires, have, become, rare, and, many, pine, forests, have, been, cut, down, for, agriculture, and, is, commonly, found, on, land, occupied, by, us, military, bases, where, pine, forests, are, kept, for, military, training, purposes, and, occasional, bombings, also, for, training, set, fires, that, maintain, pine, savannas, woodpeckers, live, in, tree, cavities, they, excavate, in, the, trunk, in, an, effort, to, increase, woodpecker, numbers, artificial, cavities, essentially, birdhouses, planted, within, tree, trunks, were, installed, to, give, woodpeckers, a, place, to, live, an, active, effort, is, made, by, the, us, military, and, workers, to, maintain, this, rare, habitat, used, by, red, cockaded, woodpeckers, conservation, genetics, studies, genetic, phenomena, that, impact, the, conservation, of, a, species, most, conservation, efforts, focus, on, managing, population, size, but, conserving, genetic, diversity, is, typically, a, high, priority, as, well, high, genetic, diversity, increases, survival, because, it, means, greater, capacity, to, adapt, to, future, environmental, changes, meanwhile, effects, associated, with, low, genetic, diversity, such, as, inbreeding, depression, and, loss, of, diversity, from, genetic, drift, often, decrease, species, survival, by, reducing, the, species, capacity, to, adapt, or, by, increasing, the, frequency, of, genetic, problems, though, not, always, the, case, certain, species, are, under, threat, because, they, have, very, low, genetic, diversity, as, such, the, best, conservation, action, would, be, to, restore, their, genetic, diversity, the, florida, panther, is, a, subspecies, of, cougar, specifically, puma, concolor, coryi, that, resides, in, the, state, of, florida, and, is, currently, endangered, historically, the, florida, panther, s, range, covered, the, entire, southeastern, us, in, the, early, 1990s, only, a, single, population, with, 20, 25, individuals, were, left, the, population, had, very, low, genetic, diversity, was, highly, inbred, and, suffered, from, several, genetic, issues, including, kinked, tails, cardiac, defects, and, low, fertility, in, 1995, eight, female, texas, cougars, were, introduced, to, the, florida, population, the, goal, was, to, increase, genetic, diversity, by, introducing, genes, from, a, different, unrelated, puma, population, by, 2007, the, florida, panther, population, had, tripled, and, offspring, between, florida, and, texas, individuals, had, higher, fertility, and, less, genetic, problems, in, 2015, the, us, fish, and, wildlife, service, estimated, there, were, 230, adult, florida, panthers, and, in, 2017, there, were, signs, that, the, population, s, range, was, expanding, within, florida, monitoring, of, wildlife, populations, is, an, important, part, of, conservation, because, it, allows, managers, to, gather, information, about, the, status, of, threatened, species, and, to, measure, the, effectiveness, of, management, strategies, monitoring, can, be, local, regional, or, range, wide, and, can, include, one, or, many, distinct, populations, metrics, commonly, gathered, during, monitoring, include, population, numbers, geographic, distribution, and, genetic, diversity, although, many, other, metrics, may, be, used, monitoring, methods, can, be, categorized, as, either, direct, or, indirect, direct, methods, rely, on, directly, seeing, or, hearing, the, animals, whereas, indirect, methods, rely, on, signs, that, indicate, the, animals, are, present, for, terrestrial, vertebrates, common, direct, monitoring, methods, include, direct, observation, mark, recapture, transects, and, variable, plot, surveys, indirect, methods, include, track, stations, fecal, counts, food, removal, open, or, closed, burrow, opening, counts, burrow, counts, runaway, counts, knockdown, cards, snow, tracks, or, responses, to, audio, calls, for, large, terrestrial, vertebrates, a, popular, method, is, to, use, camera, traps, for, population, estimation, along, with, mark, recapture, techniques, this, method, has, been, used, successfully, with, tigers, black, bears, and, numerous, other, species, trail, cameras, can, be, triggered, remotely, and, automatically, via, sound, infrared, sensors, etc, computer, vision, based, animal, individual, re, identification, methods, have, been, developed, to, automate, such, sight, resight, calculations, mark, recapture, methods, are, also, used, with, genetic, data, from, non, invasive, hair, or, fecal, samples, such, information, can, be, analyzed, independently, or, in, conjunction, with, photographic, methods, to, get, a, more, complete, picture, of, population, viability, when, designing, a, wildlife, monitoring, strategy, it, is, important, to, minimize, harm, to, the, animal, and, implement, the, 3rs, principles, replacement, reduction, refinement, in, wildlife, research, this, can, be, done, through, the, use, of, non, invasive, methods, sharing, samples, and, data, with, other, research, groups, or, optimizing, traps, to, prevent, injuries, distributing, vaccinations, to, wildlife, who, are, particularly, vulnerable, is, useful, in, conservation, to, prevent, or, decelerate, extreme, population, declination, in, a, species, from, disease, and, also, decrease, the, risk, of, a, zoonotic, spillover, to, humans, a, pathogen, that, has, never, once, been, exposed, to, a, specific, species, evolutionary, pathway, can, have, detrimental, impacts, on, the, population, in, most, cases, these, risks, escalate, in, conjunction, to, other, anthropogenic, stressors, such, as, climate, change, or, habitat, loss, that, ultimately, lead, a, population, to, extinction, without, human, intervention, methods, of, vaccination, varies, depending, on, both, the, extent, and, efficiency, of, limiting, the, transmission, of, disease, and, can, be, applied, orally, topically, intranasally, in, or, injected, either, subcutaneously, sc, or, intramuscularly, im, conservation, efforts, regarding, vaccinations, often, only, serve, the, purpose, of, preventing, disease, related, extinction, rather, than, completely, cleansing, the, population, of, the, pathogen, infection, rates, are, limited, to, a, smaller, percentage, of, the, population, case, study, ethiopian, wolf, the, ethiopian, wolf, canis, simensis, a, canid, native, to, ethiopia, is, an, endangered, species, with, less, than, 440, wolves, remaining, in, the, wild, these, wolves, are, primarily, exposed, to, the, rabies, virus, by, domestic, dogs, and, are, facing, extreme, population, declines, especially, in, the, southern, ethiopia, region, of, the, bale, mountains, to, counter, this, oral, vaccinations, are, administered, to, these, wolves, within, favorable, bait, that, is, widely, distributed, around, their, territories, the, wolves, consume, the, bait, and, with, it, ingest, the, vaccine, developing, an, immunity, to, rabies, as, antibodies, are, produced, at, significant, levels, wolves, within, these, packs, who, did, not, ingest, the, vaccine, will, be, protected, by, herd, immunity, as, fewer, wolves, are, exposed, to, the, virus, with, continued, periodic, vaccinations, conservationists, will, be, able, to, spend, more, resources, on, further, proactive, efforts, to, help, prevent, their, extinction, in, the, us, the, endangered, species, act, of, 1973, was, passed, to, protect, us, species, deemed, in, danger, of, extinction, the, concern, at, the, time, was, that, the, country, was, losing, species, that, were, scientifically, culturally, and, educationally, important, in, the, same, year, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, of, fauna, and, flora, cites, was, passed, as, part, of, an, international, agreement, to, prevent, the, global, trade, of, endangered, wildlife, in, 1980, the, world, conservation, strategy, was, developed, by, the, iucn, with, help, from, the, un, environmental, programme, world, wildlife, fund, un, food, and, agricultural, organization, and, unesco, its, purpose, was, to, promote, the, conservation, of, living, resources, important, to, humans, in, 1992, the, convention, on, biological, diversity, cbd, was, agreed, on, at, the, un, conference, on, environment, and, development, often, called, the, rio, earth, summit, as, an, international, accord, to, protect, the, earth, s, biological, resources, and, diversity, according, to, the, national, wildlife, federation, wildlife, conservation, in, the, us, gets, a, majority, of, its, funding, through, appropriations, from, the, federal, budget, annual, federal, and, state, grants, and, financial, efforts, from, programs, such, as, the, conservation, reserve, program, wetlands, reserve, program, and, wildlife, habitat, incentives, program, a, substantial, amount, of, funding, comes, from, the, sale, of, hunting, fishing, licenses, game, tags, stamps, and, excise, taxes, from, the, purchase, of, hunting, equipment, and, ammunition, the, endangered, species, act, is, a, continuously, updated, list, that, remains, up, to, date, on, species, that, are, endangered, or, threatened, along, with, the, update, of, the, list, the, endangered, species, act, also, seeks, to, implement, actions, to, protect, the, species, within, its, list, furthermore, the, endangered, species, act, also, lists, the, species, that, the, act, has, recovered, it, is, estimated, that, the, act, has, prevented, the, extinction, of, about, 291, species, like, bald, eagles, and, humpback, whales, since, its, implementation, through, its, different, recovery, plans, and, the, protection, that, it, provides, for, these, threatened, species, in, the, late, 1980s, as, the, public, became, dissatisfied, with, government, environmental, conservation, efforts, people, began, supporting, private, sector, conservation, efforts, which, included, several, non, governmental, organizations, ngos, seeing, this, rise, in, support, for, ngos, the, u, s, congress, made, amendments, to, the, foreign, assistance, act, in, 1979, and, 1986, earmarking, u, s, agency, for, international, development, usaid, funds, for, from, 1990, till, now, environmental, conservation, ngos, have, become, increasingly, more, focused, on, the, political, and, economic, impact, of, usaid, funds, dispersed, for, preserving, the, environment, and, its, natural, resources, after, the, terrorist, attacks, on, 9, 11, and, the, start, of, former, president, bush, s, war, on, terror, maintaining, and, improving, the, quality, of, the, environment, and, its, natural, resources, became, a, priority, to, prevent, international, tensions, according, to, the, legislation, on, foreign, relations, through, 2002, and, section, 117, of, the, 1961, foreign, assistance, act, many, ngos, exist, to, actively, promote, or, be, involved, with, wildlife, conservation
