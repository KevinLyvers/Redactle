severe, acute, respiratory, syndrome, sars, is, a, viral, respiratory, disease, of, zoonotic, origin, caused, by, the, virus, sars, cov, 1, the, first, identified, strain, of, the, sars, related, coronavirus, the, first, known, cases, occurred, in, november, 2002, and, the, syndrome, caused, the, 2002, 2004, sars, outbreak, in, the, 2010s, chinese, scientists, traced, the, virus, through, the, intermediary, of, asian, palm, civets, to, cave, dwelling, horseshoe, bats, in, xiyang, yi, ethnic, township, yunnan, sars, was, a, relatively, rare, disease, at, the, end, of, the, epidemic, in, june, 2003, the, incidence, was, 8, 469, cases, with, a, case, fatality, rate, cfr, of, 11, no, cases, of, sars, cov, 1, have, been, reported, worldwide, since, 2004, in, december, 2019, a, second, strain, of, sars, cov, was, identified, sars, cov, 2, this, strain, causes, coronavirus, disease, 2019, covid, 19, the, disease, behind, the, covid, 19, pandemic, sars, produces, flu, like, symptoms, which, may, include, fever, muscle, pain, lethargy, cough, sore, throat, and, other, nonspecific, symptoms, sars, often, leads, to, shortness, of, breath, and, pneumonia, which, may, be, direct, viral, pneumonia, or, secondary, bacterial, pneumonia, the, average, incubation, period, for, sars, is, 4, 6, days, although, it, is, rarely, as, short, as, 1, day, or, as, long, as, 14, days, the, primary, route, of, transmission, for, sars, cov, is, contact, of, the, mucous, membranes, with, respiratory, droplets, or, fomites, as, with, all, respiratory, pathogens, once, presumed, to, transmit, via, respiratory, droplets, it, is, highly, likely, to, be, carried, by, the, aerosols, generated, during, routine, breathing, talking, and, even, singing, while, diarrhea, is, common, in, people, with, sars, the, fecal, oral, route, does, not, appear, to, be, a, common, mode, of, transmission, the, basic, reproduction, number, of, sars, cov, r, 0, ranges, from, 2, to, 4, depending, on, different, analyses, control, measures, introduced, in, april, 2003, reduced, the, r, to, 0, 4, sars, cov, may, be, suspected, in, a, patient, who, has, for, a, case, to, be, considered, probable, a, chest, x, ray, must, be, indicative, for, atypical, pneumonia, or, acute, respiratory, distress, syndrome, the, who, has, added, the, category, of, laboratory, confirmed, sars, which, means, patients, who, would, otherwise, be, considered, probable, and, have, tested, positive, for, sars, based, on, one, of, the, approved, tests, elisa, immunofluorescence, or, pcr, but, whose, chest, x, ray, findings, do, not, show, sars, cov, infection, e, g, ground, glass, opacities, patchy, consolidations, unilateral, the, appearance, of, sars, cov, in, chest, x, rays, is, not, always, uniform, but, generally, appears, as, an, abnormality, with, patchy, infiltrates, there, is, a, vaccine, for, sars, although, in, march, 2020, immunologist, anthony, fauci, said, the, cdc, developed, one, and, placed, it, in, the, strategic, national, stockpile, that, vaccine, is, a, final, product, and, field, ready, as, of, march, 2022, clinical, isolation, and, vaccination, remain, the, most, effective, means, to, prevent, the, spread, of, sars, other, preventive, measures, include, many, public, health, interventions, were, made, to, try, to, control, the, spread, of, the, disease, which, is, mainly, spread, through, respiratory, droplets, in, the, air, either, inhaled, or, deposited, on, surfaces, and, subsequently, transferred, to, a, body, s, mucous, membranes, these, interventions, included, earlier, detection, of, the, disease, isolation, of, people, who, are, infected, droplet, and, contact, precautions, and, the, use, of, personal, protective, equipment, ppe, including, masks, and, isolation, gowns, a, 2017, meta, analysis, found, that, for, medical, professionals, wearing, n, 95, masks, could, reduce, the, chances, of, getting, sick, up, to, 80, compared, to, no, mask, a, screening, process, was, also, put, in, place, at, airports, to, monitor, air, travel, to, and, from, affected, countries, sars, cov, is, most, infectious, in, severely, ill, patients, which, usually, occurs, during, the, second, week, of, illness, this, delayed, infectious, period, meant, that, quarantine, was, highly, effective, people, who, were, isolated, before, day, five, of, their, illness, rarely, transmitted, the, disease, to, others, as, of, 2017, the, cdc, was, still, working, to, make, federal, and, local, rapid, response, guidelines, and, recommendations, in, the, event, of, a, reappearance, of, the, virus, as, sars, is, a, viral, disease, antibiotics, do, not, have, direct, effect, but, may, be, used, against, bacterial, secondary, infection, treatment, of, sars, is, mainly, supportive, with, antipyretics, supplemental, oxygen, and, mechanical, ventilation, as, needed, while, ribavirin, is, commonly, used, to, treat, sars, there, seems, to, have, little, to, no, effect, on, sars, cov, and, no, impact, on, patient, s, outcomes, there, is, currently, no, proven, antiviral, therapy, tested, substances, include, ribavirin, lopinavir, ritonavir, type, i, interferon, that, have, thus, far, shown, no, conclusive, contribution, to, the, disease, s, course, administration, of, corticosteroids, is, recommended, by, the, british, thoracic, society, british, infection, society, health, protection, agency, in, patients, with, severe, disease, and, o2, saturation, of, 90, people, with, sars, cov, must, be, isolated, preferably, in, negative, pressure, rooms, with, complete, barrier, nursing, precautions, taken, for, any, necessary, contact, with, these, patients, to, limit, the, chances, of, medical, personnel, becoming, infected, in, certain, cases, natural, ventilation, by, opening, doors, and, windows, is, documented, to, help, decreasing, indoor, concentration, of, virus, particles, some, of, the, more, serious, damage, caused, by, sars, may, be, due, to, the, body, s, own, immune, system, reacting, in, what, is, known, as, cytokine, storm, vaccines, can, help, the, immune, system, to, create, enough, antibodies, and, decrease, a, risk, of, side, effects, like, arm, pain, fever, and, headache, according, to, research, papers, published, in, 2005, and, 2006, the, identification, and, development, of, novel, vaccines, and, medicines, to, treat, sars, was, a, priority, for, governments, and, public, health, agencies, around, the, world, in, early, 2004, an, early, clinical, trial, on, volunteers, was, planned, a, major, researcher, s, 2016, request, however, demonstrated, that, no, field, ready, sars, vaccine, had, been, completed, because, likely, market, driven, priorities, had, ended, funding, several, consequent, reports, from, china, on, some, recovered, sars, patients, showed, severe, long, time, sequelae, the, most, typical, diseases, include, among, other, things, pulmonary, fibrosis, osteoporosis, and, femoral, necrosis, which, have, led, in, some, cases, to, the, complete, loss, of, working, ability, or, even, self, care, ability, of, people, who, have, recovered, from, sars, as, a, result, of, quarantine, procedures, some, of, the, post, sars, patients, have, been, diagnosed, with, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, and, major, depressive, disorder, sars, was, a, relatively, rare, disease, at, the, end, of, the, epidemic, in, june, 2003, the, incidence, was, 8, 422, cases, with, a, case, fatality, rate, cfr, of, 11, the, case, fatality, rate, cfr, ranges, from, 0, to, 50, depending, on, the, age, group, of, the, patient, patients, under, 24, were, least, likely, to, die, less, than, 1, those, 65, and, older, were, most, likely, to, die, over, 55, as, with, mers, and, covid, 19, sars, resulted, in, significantly, more, deaths, of, males, than, females, the, sars, epidemic, began, in, the, guangdong, province, of, china, in, november, 2002, the, earliest, case, developed, symptoms, on, 16, november, 2002, the, index, patient, a, farmer, from, shunde, foshan, guangdong, was, treated, in, the, first, people, s, hospital, of, foshan, the, patient, died, soon, after, and, no, definite, diagnosis, was, made, on, his, cause, of, death, despite, taking, some, action, to, control, it, chinese, government, officials, did, not, inform, the, world, health, organization, of, the, outbreak, until, february, 2003, this, lack, of, openness, caused, delays, in, efforts, to, control, the, epidemic, resulting, in, criticism, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, from, the, international, community, china, officially, apologized, for, early, slowness, in, dealing, with, the, sars, epidemic, in, 2003, when, the, virus, broke, out, in, china, a, 72, year, old, with, sars, infected, multiple, people, on, board, an, air, china, boeing, 737, causing, 5, deaths, the, viral, outbreak, was, subsequently, genetically, traced, to, a, colony, of, cave, dwelling, horseshoe, bats, in, xiyang, yi, ethnic, township, yunnan, the, outbreak, first, came, to, the, attention, of, the, international, medical, community, on, 27, november, 2002, when, canada, s, global, public, health, intelligence, network, gphin, an, electronic, warning, system, that, is, part, of, the, world, health, organization, s, global, outbreak, alert, and, response, network, goarn, picked, up, reports, of, a, flu, outbreak, in, china, through, internet, media, monitoring, and, analysis, and, sent, them, to, the, who, while, gphin, s, capability, had, recently, been, upgraded, to, enable, arabic, chinese, english, french, russian, and, spanish, translation, the, system, was, limited, to, english, or, french, in, presenting, this, information, thus, while, the, first, reports, of, an, unusual, outbreak, were, in, chinese, an, english, report, was, not, generated, until, 21, january, 2003, the, first, super, spreader, was, admitted, to, the, sun, yat, sen, memorial, hospital, in, guangzhou, on, 31, january, which, soon, spread, the, disease, to, nearby, hospitals, in, early, april, 2003, after, a, prominent, physician, jiang, yanyong, pushed, to, report, the, danger, to, china, there, appeared, to, be, a, change, in, official, policy, when, sars, began, to, receive, a, much, greater, prominence, in, the, official, media, some, have, directly, attributed, this, to, the, death, of, an, american, teacher, james, earl, salisbury, in, hong, kong, it, was, around, this, same, time, that, jiang, yanyong, made, accusations, regarding, the, undercounting, of, cases, in, beijing, military, hospitals, after, intense, pressure, chinese, officials, allowed, international, officials, to, investigate, the, situation, there, this, revealed, problems, plaguing, the, aging, mainland, chinese, healthcare, system, including, increasing, decentralization, red, tape, and, inadequate, communication, many, healthcare, workers, in, the, affected, nations, risked, their, lives, and, died, by, treating, patients, and, trying, to, contain, the, infection, before, ways, to, prevent, infection, were, known, the, epidemic, reached, the, public, spotlight, in, february, 2003, when, an, american, businessman, traveling, from, china, johnny, chen, became, affected, by, pneumonia, like, symptoms, while, on, a, flight, to, singapore, the, plane, stopped, in, hanoi, vietnam, where, the, patient, died, in, hanoi, french, hospital, several, of, the, medical, staff, who, treated, him, soon, developed, the, same, disease, despite, basic, hospital, procedures, italian, doctor, carlo, urbani, identified, the, threat, and, communicated, it, to, who, and, the, vietnamese, government, he, later, died, from, the, disease, the, severity, of, the, symptoms, and, the, infection, among, hospital, staff, alarmed, global, health, authorities, who, were, fearful, of, another, emergent, pneumonia, epidemic, on, 12, march, 2003, the, who, issued, a, global, alert, followed, by, a, health, alert, by, the, united, states, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, local, transmission, of, sars, took, place, in, toronto, ottawa, san, francisco, ulaanbaatar, manila, singapore, taiwan, hanoi, and, hong, kong, whereas, within, china, it, spread, to, guangdong, jilin, hebei, hubei, shaanxi, jiangsu, shanxi, tianjin, and, inner, mongolia, the, disease, spread, in, hong, kong, from, liu, jianlun, a, guangdong, doctor, who, was, treating, patients, at, sun, yat, sen, memorial, hospital, he, arrived, in, february, and, stayed, on, the, ninth, floor, of, the, metropole, hotel, in, kowloon, infecting, 16, of, the, hotel, visitors, those, visitors, traveled, to, canada, singapore, taiwan, and, vietnam, spreading, sars, to, those, locations, another, larger, cluster, of, cases, in, hong, kong, centred, on, the, amoy, gardens, housing, estate, its, spread, is, suspected, to, have, been, facilitated, by, defects, in, its, bathroom, drainage, system, that, allowed, sewer, gases, including, virus, particles, to, vent, into, the, room, bathroom, fans, exhausted, the, gases, and, wind, carried, the, contagion, to, adjacent, downwind, complexes, concerned, citizens, in, hong, kong, worried, that, information, was, not, reaching, people, quickly, enough, and, created, a, website, called, sosick, org, which, eventually, forced, the, hong, kong, government, to, provide, information, related, to, sars, in, a, timely, manner, the, first, cohort, of, affected, people, were, discharged, from, hospital, on, 29, march, 2003, the, first, case, of, sars, in, toronto, was, identified, on, 23, february, 2003, beginning, with, an, elderly, woman, kwan, sui, chu, who, had, returned, from, a, trip, to, hong, kong, and, died, on, 5, march, the, virus, eventually, infected, 257, individuals, in, the, province, of, ontario, the, trajectory, of, this, outbreak, is, typically, divided, into, two, phases, the, first, centring, around, her, son, tse, chi, kwai, who, infected, other, patients, at, the, scarborough, grace, hospital, and, died, on, 13, march, the, second, major, wave, of, cases, was, clustered, around, accidental, exposure, among, patients, visitors, and, staff, within, the, north, york, general, hospital, the, who, officially, removed, toronto, from, its, list, of, infected, areas, by, the, end, of, june, 2003, the, official, response, by, the, ontario, provincial, government, and, canadian, federal, government, has, been, widely, criticized, in, the, years, following, the, outbreak, brian, schwartz, vice, chair, of, ontario, s, sars, scientific, advisory, committee, described, public, health, officials, preparedness, and, emergency, response, at, the, time, of, the, outbreak, as, very, very, basic, and, minimal, at, best, critics, of, the, response, often, cite, poorly, outlined, and, enforced, protocol, for, protecting, healthcare, workers, and, identifying, infected, patients, as, a, major, contributing, factor, to, the, continued, spread, of, the, virus, the, atmosphere, of, fear, and, uncertainty, surrounding, the, outbreak, resulted, in, staffing, issues, in, area, hospitals, when, healthcare, workers, elected, to, resign, rather, than, risk, exposure, to, sars, in, late, february, 2003, italian, doctor, carlo, urbani, was, called, into, the, french, hospital, of, hanoi, to, look, at, johnny, chen, an, american, businessman, who, had, fallen, ill, with, what, doctors, thought, was, a, bad, case, of, influenza, urbani, realized, that, chen, s, ailment, was, probably, a, new, and, highly, contagious, disease, he, immediately, notified, the, who, he, also, persuaded, the, vietnamese, health, ministry, to, begin, isolating, patients, and, screening, travelers, thus, slowing, the, early, pace, of, the, epidemic, he, subsequently, contracted, the, disease, himself, and, died, in, march, 2003, malik, peiris, and, his, colleagues, became, the, first, to, isolate, the, virus, that, causes, sars, a, novel, coronavirus, now, known, as, sars, cov, 1, by, june, 2003, peiris, together, with, his, long, time, collaborators, leo, poon, and, guan, yi, has, developed, a, rapid, diagnostic, test, for, sars, cov, 1, using, real, time, polymerase, chain, reaction, the, cdc, and, canada, s, national, microbiology, laboratory, identified, the, sars, genome, in, april, 2003, scientists, at, erasmus, university, in, rotterdam, the, netherlands, demonstrated, that, the, sars, coronavirus, fulfilled, koch, s, postulates, thereby, suggesting, it, as, the, causative, agent, in, the, experiments, macaques, infected, with, the, virus, developed, the, same, symptoms, as, human, sars, patients, in, late, may, 2003, a, study, was, conducted, using, samples, of, wild, animals, sold, as, food, in, the, local, market, in, guangdong, china, the, study, found, that, sars, like, coronaviruses, could, be, isolated, from, masked, palm, civets, paguma, sp, genomic, sequencing, determined, that, these, animal, viruses, were, very, similar, to, human, sars, viruses, however, they, were, phylogenetically, distinct, and, so, the, study, concluded, that, it, was, unclear, whether, they, were, the, natural, reservoir, in, the, wild, still, more, than, 10, 000, masked, palm, civets, were, killed, in, guangdong, province, since, they, were, a, potential, infectious, source, the, virus, was, also, later, found, in, raccoon, dogs, nyctereuteus, sp, ferret, badgers, melogale, spp, and, domestic, cats, in, 2005, two, studies, identified, a, number, of, sars, like, coronaviruses, in, chinese, bats, phylogenetic, analysis, of, these, viruses, indicated, a, high, probability, that, sars, coronavirus, originated, in, bats, and, spread, to, humans, either, directly, or, through, animals, held, in, chinese, markets, the, bats, did, not, show, any, visible, signs, of, disease, but, are, the, likely, natural, reservoirs, of, sars, like, coronaviruses, in, late, 2006, scientists, from, the, chinese, centre, for, disease, control, and, prevention, of, hong, kong, university, and, the, guangzhou, centre, for, disease, control, and, prevention, established, a, genetic, link, between, the, sars, coronavirus, appearing, in, civets, and, in, the, second, 2004, human, outbreak, bearing, out, claims, that, the, disease, had, jumped, across, species, it, took, 14, years, to, find, the, original, bat, population, likely, responsible, for, the, sars, pandemic, in, december, 2017, after, years, of, searching, across, china, where, the, disease, first, emerged, researchers, reported, that, they, had, found, a, remote, cave, in, xiyang, yi, ethnic, township, yunnan, province, which, is, home, to, horseshoe, bats, that, carry, a, strain, of, a, particular, virus, known, as, a, coronavirus, this, strain, has, all, the, genetic, building, blocks, of, the, type, that, triggered, the, global, outbreak, of, sars, in, 2002, the, research, was, performed, by, shi, zhengli, cui, jie, and, co, workers, at, the, wuhan, institute, of, virology, china, and, published, in, plos, pathogens, the, authors, are, quoted, as, stating, that, another, deadly, outbreak, of, sars, could, emerge, at, any, time, the, cave, where, they, discovered, their, strain, is, only, a, kilometre, from, the, nearest, village, the, virus, was, ephemeral, and, seasonal, in, bats, in, 2019, a, similar, virus, to, sars, caused, a, cluster, of, infections, in, wuhan, eventually, leading, to, the, covid, 19, pandemic, a, small, number, of, cats, and, dogs, tested, positive, for, the, virus, during, the, outbreak, however, these, animals, did, not, transmit, the, virus, to, other, animals, of, the, same, species, or, to, humans, the, world, health, organization, declared, severe, acute, respiratory, syndrome, contained, on, 5, july, 2003, the, containment, was, achieved, through, successful, public, health, measures, in, the, following, months, four, sars, cases, were, reported, in, china, between, december, 2003, and, january, 2004, while, sars, cov, 1, probably, persists, as, a, potential, zoonotic, threat, in, its, original, animal, reservoir, human, to, human, transmission, of, this, virus, may, be, considered, eradicated, because, no, human, case, has, been, documented, since, four, minor, brief, subsequent, outbreaks, in, 2004, after, containment, there, were, four, laboratory, accidents, that, resulted, in, infections, study, of, live, sars, specimens, requires, a, biosafety, level, 3, bsl, 3, facility, some, studies, of, inactivated, sars, specimens, can, be, done, at, biosafety, level, 2, facilities, fear, of, contracting, the, virus, from, consuming, infected, wild, animals, resulted, in, public, bans, and, reduced, business, for, meat, markets, in, southern, china, and, hong, kong, the, who, declared, the, end, of, the, pandemic, on, march, 24, 2004
