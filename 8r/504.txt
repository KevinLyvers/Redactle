the, haddock, melanogrammus, aeglefinus, is, a, saltwater, ray, finned, fish, from, the, family, gadidae, the, true, cods, it, is, the, only, species, in, the, monotypic, genus, melanogrammus, it, is, found, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, and, associated, seas, where, it, is, an, important, species, for, fisheries, especially, in, northern, europe, where, it, is, marketed, fresh, frozen, and, smoked, smoked, varieties, include, the, finnan, haddie, and, the, arbroath, smokie, other, smoked, versions, include, long, boneless, the, fileted, side, of, larger, haddock, smoked, in, oak, chips, with, the, skin, left, on, the, fillet, the, haddock, has, the, elongated, tapering, body, shape, typical, of, members, of, the, cod, family, it, has, a, relatively, small, mouth, which, does, not, extend, to, below, the, eye, with, the, lower, profile, of, the, face, being, straight, and, the, upper, profile, slightly, rounded, this, gives, its, snout, a, characteristic, wedge, shaped, profile, the, upper, jaw, projects, beyond, the, lower, more, so, than, in, the, atlantic, cod, there, is, a, rather, small, barbel, on, the, chin, there, are, three, dorsal, fins, the, first, being, triangular, in, shape, and, these, dorsal, fins, have, 14, to, 17, fin, rays, in, the, first, 20, to, 24, in, the, second, and, 19, to, 22, in, the, third, there, are, also, two, anal, fins, and, in, these, there, are, 21, to, 25, fin, rays, in, the, first, and, 20, to, 24, fin, rays, in, the, second, the, anal, and, dorsal, fins, are, all, separated, from, each, other, the, pelvic, fins, are, small, with, an, elongated, first, fin, ray, the, upper, side, of, the, haddock, s, body, varies, in, colour, from, dark, grey, brown, to, nearly, black, while, the, lower, part, of, the, body, is, dull, silvery, white, it, has, a, distinctive, black, lateral, line, contrasting, with, the, whitish, background, colour, and, which, curves, slightly, over, the, pectoral, fins, it, also, has, a, distinctive, oval, black, blotch, or, thumbprint, sometimes, called, the, devil, s, thumbprint, which, sits, between, the, lateral, line, and, the, pectoral, fin, a, feature, which, leads, to, the, name, of, the, genus, melanogrammus, which, derives, from, greek, melanos, meaning, black, and, gramma, meaning, letter, or, signal, the, dorsal, pectoral, and, caudal, fins, are, dark, grey, in, colour, while, the, anal, fins, are, pale, matching, the, colour, of, the, silvery, sides, with, black, speckles, at, their, bases, the, pelvic, fins, are, white, with, a, variable, amount, of, black, spots, occasionally, there, are, differently, coloured, variants, recorded, which, may, be, barred, golden, on, the, back, or, lack, the, dark, shoulder, blotch, the, longest, haddock, recorded, was, 94, centimetres, 37, inches, in, length, and, weighed, 11, kilograms, 24, pounds, however, haddock, are, rarely, over, 80, cm, 31, 1, 2, in, in, length, and, the, vast, majority, of, haddocks, caught, in, the, united, kingdom, measure, between, 30, and, 70, cm, 12, and, 27, 1, 2, in, in, eastern, canada, waters, haddock, range, in, size, from, 38, to, 69, cm, 15, to, 27, in, in, length, and, 0, 9, to, 1, 8, kg, 2, lb, 0, oz, to, 3, lb, 15, oz, in, weight, the, haddock, has, populations, on, either, side, of, the, north, atlantic, but, it, is, more, abundant, in, the, eastern, atlantic, than, it, is, on, the, north, american, side, in, the, north, east, atlantic, it, occurs, from, the, bay, of, biscay, north, to, spitzbergen, however, it, is, most, abundant, north, of, the, english, channel, it, also, occurs, around, novaya, zemlya, and, the, barents, sea, in, the, arctic, the, largest, stocks, are, in, the, north, sea, off, the, faroe, islands, off, iceland, and, the, coast, of, norway, but, these, are, discrete, populations, with, little, interchange, between, them, off, north, america, the, haddock, is, found, from, western, greenland, south, to, cape, hatteras, but, the, main, commercially, fished, stock, occurs, from, cape, cod, and, the, grand, banks, the, haddock, is, a, demersal, species, which, occurs, at, depths, from, 10, to, 450, m, 33, to, 1, 500, ft, 5, 5, to, 250, fathoms, although, it, is, most, frequently, recorded, at, 80, to, 200, m, 300, to, 700, ft, 40, to, 100, fathoms, it, is, found, over, substrates, made, up, of, rock, sand, gravel, or, shells, and, it, prefers, temperatures, of, between, 4, and, 10, c, 39, and, 50, f, off, iceland, and, in, the, barents, sea, haddock, undergo, extensive, migrations, but, in, the, north, western, atlantic, its, movements, are, more, restricted, consisting, of, movements, to, and, from, their, spawning, areas, they, reach, sexual, maturity, at, 4, years, old, in, males, and, 5, years, old, in, females, except, for, the, population, in, the, north, sea, which, matures, at, ages, of, 2, years, in, males, and, 3, years, in, females, the, overall, sex, ratio, is, roughly, 1, 1, but, in, shallower, areas, females, predominate, while, the, males, show, a, preference, for, waters, further, offshore, the, fecundity, of, the, females, varies, with, size, a, fish, of, 25, cm, 10, in, length, bears, 55, 000, eggs, while, a, fish, at, 91, cm, 36, in, has, 1, 841, 000, eggs, spawning, takes, place, from, depths, of, around, 50, to, 150, m, 200, to, 500, ft, 30, to, 80, fathoms, in, the, northwestern, atlantic, spawning, lasts, from, january, to, july, although, it, does, not, occur, simultaneously, in, all, areas, and, in, the, northeastern, atlantic, the, spawning, season, runs, from, february, to, june, peaking, in, march, and, april, the, eggs, are, pelagic, with, a, diameter, of, 1, 2, to, 1, 7, millimetres, 3, 64, to, 9, 128, in, and, they, take, one, to, three, weeks, to, hatch, following, metamorphosis, the, past, larval, fish, remain, pelagic, until, they, attain, a, length, of, around, 7, cm, 3, in, when, they, settle, to, a, demersal, habit, their, growth, rate, shows, considerable, regional, variation, and, fish, at, one, year, old, can, measure, 17, to, 19, cm, 6, 1, 2, to, 7, 1, 2, in, at, 2, years, old, 25, to, 36, cm, 10, to, 14, in, up, to, 75, to, 82, cm, 29, 1, 2, to, 32, 1, 2, in, at, 13, years, old, their, lifespan, is, around, 14, years, the, most, important, spawning, grounds, are, in, the, waters, off, the, central, coast, of, norway, off, the, southwest, of, iceland, and, over, the, georges, bank, the, fish, which, spawn, in, inshore, waters, are, normally, smaller, and, younger, fish, than, those, which, occur, in, offshore, areas, the, younger, fish, have, a, spawning, season, which, is, less, than, half, of, that, of, the, larger, and, older, stock, offshore, once, hatched, the, larvae, do, not, appear, to, travel, far, from, their, spawning, grounds, however, some, larvae, spawning, off, the, west, coast, of, scotland, are, transported, into, the, north, sea, through, the, fair, isle, shetland, gap, or, to, the, northeast, of, shetland, in, their, larval, stages, haddock, mainly, feed, on, the, immature, stages, of, copepods, ostracods, and, limacina, with, their, diet, changing, as, they, grow, moving, on, to, larger, pelagic, prey, such, as, amphipods, euphausiids, eggs, of, invertebrates, zoea, larvae, of, decapods, and, increasing, numbers, of, copepods, once, they, have, reached, the, settled, demersal, post, larval, stage, they, gradually, switch, from, pelagic, to, benthic, prey, adults, primarily, feed, on, benthic, invertebrates, such, as, sea, urchins, brittlestars, bivalves, and, worms, however, they, will, feed, opportunistically, on, smaller, fish, such, as, capelin, sandeels, and, norway, pout, juvenile, haddock, are, an, important, prey, for, larger, demersal, fish, including, other, gadoids, while, seals, prey, on, the, larger, fish, the, recorded, growth, rates, of, haddock, underwent, significant, change, over, the, 30, to, 40, years, up, to, 2011, growth, has, been, more, rapid, in, recent, years, with, haddock, attaining, adult, size, much, earlier, than, was, noted, 30, 40, years, ago, however, the, degree, to, which, these, larger, younger, fish, contribute, to, reproductive, success, of, the, population, is, unknown, the, growth, rates, of, haddock, however, have, slowed, in, recent, years, there, is, some, evidence, which, indicates, that, these, slower, growth, rates, may, be, the, result, of, an, exceptionally, large, year, class, in, 2003, the, haddock, stock, periodically, has, higher, than, normal, productivity, for, example, in, 1962, and, 1967, and, to, a, lesser, extent, 1974, and, 1999, these, result, in, a, more, southerly, distribution, of, the, fish, and, have, a, strong, effect, on, the, biomass, of, the, spawning, stock, but, because, of, high, fishing, mortality, these, revivals, do, not, have, any, lasting, effect, on, the, population, in, general, there, was, above, average, recruitment, from, the, 1960s, up, to, the, early, 1980s, similar, to, recruitment, for, atlantic, cod, and, whiting, this, has, been, called, the, gadoid, outburst, there, was, strong, recruitment, in, 1999, but, since, then, the, recruitment, rate, has, been, very, low, cod, and, related, species, are, plagued, by, parasites, for, example, the, cod, worm, lernaeocera, branchialis, starts, life, as, a, copepod, a, small, free, swimming, crustacean, larva, the, first, host, used, by, cod, worm, is, a, flatfish, or, lumpsucker, which, they, capture, with, grasping, hooks, at, the, front, of, their, bodies, they, penetrate, the, lumpsucker, with, a, thin, filament, which, they, use, to, suck, its, blood, the, nourished, cod, worms, then, mate, on, the, lumpsucker, the, female, worm, with, her, now, fertilized, eggs, then, finds, a, cod, or, a, cod, like, fish, such, as, a, haddock, or, whiting, there, the, worm, clings, to, the, gills, while, it, metamorphoses, into, a, plump, sinusoidal, wormlike, body, with, a, coiled, mass, of, egg, strings, at, the, rear, the, front, part, of, the, worm, s, body, penetrates, the, body, of, the, cod, until, it, enters, the, rear, bulb, of, the, host, s, heart, there, firmly, rooted, in, the, cod, s, circulatory, system, the, front, part, of, the, parasite, develops, like, the, branches, of, a, tree, reaching, into, the, main, artery, in, this, way, the, worm, extracts, nutrients, from, the, cod, s, blood, remaining, safely, tucked, beneath, the, cod, s, gill, cover, until, it, releases, a, new, generation, of, offspring, into, the, water, the, haddock, was, first, formally, described, as, gadus, aeglefinus, in, 1758, by, carolus, linnaeus, in, the, 10th, edition, of, volume, one, of, his, systema, naturae, with, a, type, locality, given, as, european, seas, in, 1862, theodore, nicholas, gill, created, the, genus, melanogrammus, with, m, aeglefinus, as, its, only, species, the, 5th, edition, of, fishes, of, the, world, classifies, the, haddock, within, the, subfamily, gadinae, the, typical, cods, of, the, family, gadidae, which, is, within, the, superfamily, gadoidea, of, the, order, gadiformes, the, generic, name, melanogrammus, means, black, line, a, reference, to, the, black, lateral, line, of, this, species, the, specific, name, is, a, latinisation, of, the, vernacular, names, egrefin, and, eglefin, used, in, france, and, england, haddock, is, fished, year, round, using, gear, such, as, danish, seine, nets, trawlers, long, lines, and, gill, nets, and, is, often, caught, in, mixed, species, fishery, with, other, groundfish, species, such, as, cod, and, whiting, the, main, fishing, grounds, in, the, eastern, atlantic, are, in, the, barents, sea, around, iceland, around, the, faeroe, islands, in, the, north, sea, celtic, sea, and, in, the, english, channel, landings, in, the, eastern, atlantic, have, fluctuated, around, 200, 350, thousand, tonnes, in, the, period, 1980, 2017, during, the, 1980s, the, largest, portion, of, the, catch, was, taken, at, rockall, but, from, about, 2000, the, majority, of, the, catch, is, caught, in, the, barents, sea, all, the, stocks, in, eastern, atlantic, are, assessed, by, ices, which, publish, a, recommendations, on, an, annual, basis, for, total, allowable, catch, in, the, western, atlantic, the, eastern, georges, bank, haddock, stock, is, jointly, assessed, on, an, annual, basis, by, canada, and, the, united, states, and, the, stock, is, collaboratively, managed, through, the, canada, united, states, transboundary, management, guidance, committee, which, was, established, in, 2000, the, commercial, catch, of, haddock, in, north, america, was, approximately, 40, 60, thousand, tonnes, per, year, between, 1920, and, 1960, this, declined, sharply, in, the, late, 1960s, to, between, 5, and, 30, thousand, tonnes, per, year, despite, a, few, good, years, post, 1970, landings, have, not, returned, to, historical, levels, haddock, currently, resides, on, the, greenpeace, seafood, red, list, due, to, concerns, regarding, the, impact, of, bottom, trawls, on, the, marine, environment, in, contrast, monterey, bay, aquarium, considers, haddock, a, good, alternative, many, haddock, fisheries, have, been, certified, as, sustainable, by, the, marine, stewardship, council, all, seven, stocks, assessed, in, the, eastern, atlantic, are, currently, considered, by, ices, to, be, harvested, sustainably, the, haddock, populations, in, the, western, atlantic, offshore, grounds, of, georges, bank, off, new, england, and, nova, scotia, are, also, considered, to, be, harvested, sustainably, haddock, is, very, popular, as, a, food, fish, it, is, sold, fresh, or, preserved, by, smoking, freezing, drying, or, to, a, small, extent, canning, haddock, along, with, atlantic, cod, and, plaice, is, one, of, the, most, popular, fish, used, in, british, fish, and, chips, when, fresh, the, flesh, of, haddock, is, clean, and, white, and, its, cooking, is, often, similar, to, that, of, cod, a, fresh, haddock, fillet, will, be, firm, and, translucent, and, hold, together, well, but, less, fresh, fillets, will, become, nearly, opaque, young, fresh, haddock, and, cod, fillets, are, often, sold, as, scrod, in, boston, massachusetts, this, refers, to, the, size, of, the, fish, which, have, a, variety, of, sizes, i, e, scrod, markets, and, cows, haddock, is, the, predominant, fish, of, choice, in, scotland, in, a, fish, supper, it, is, also, the, main, ingredient, of, norwegian, fishballs, fiskeboller, unlike, cod, haddock, is, not, an, appropriate, fish, for, salting, and, preservation, is, more, commonly, effected, by, drying, and, smoking, the, smoking, of, haddock, was, highly, refined, in, grimsby, traditional, grimsby, smoked, fish, mainly, haddock, but, sometimes, cod, is, produced, in, the, traditional, smokehouses, in, grimsby, which, are, mostly, family, run, businesses, that, have, developed, their, skills, over, many, generations, grimsby, fish, market, sources, its, haddock, from, the, north, east, atlantic, principally, iceland, norway, and, the, faroe, islands, these, fishing, grounds, are, sustainably, managed, and, have, not, seen, the, large, scale, depreciation, in, fish, stocks, seen, in, eu, waters, one, popular, form, of, haddock, is, finnan, haddie, which, is, named, after, the, fishing, village, of, finnan, or, findon, in, scotland, where, the, fish, was, originally, cold, smoked, over, smouldering, peat, finnan, haddie, is, often, poached, in, milk, and, served, for, breakfast, the, town, of, arbroath, on, the, east, coast, of, scotland, produces, the, arbroath, smokie, this, is, a, hot, smoked, haddock, which, requires, no, further, cooking, before, eating, smoked, haddock, is, naturally, an, off, white, colour, and, it, is, frequently, dyed, yellow, as, are, other, smoked, fish, smoked, haddock, is, the, essential, ingredient, in, the, anglo, indian, dish, kedgeree, and, also, in, the, scottish, dish, cullen, skink, a, chowder, like, soup
