the, sperm, whale, or, cachalot, physeter, macrocephalus, is, the, largest, of, the, toothed, whales, and, the, largest, toothed, predator, it, is, the, only, living, member, of, the, genus, physeter, and, one, of, three, extant, species, in, the, sperm, whale, family, along, with, the, pygmy, sperm, whale, and, dwarf, sperm, whale, of, the, genus, kogia, the, sperm, whale, is, a, pelagic, mammal, with, a, worldwide, range, and, will, migrate, seasonally, for, feeding, and, breeding, females, and, young, males, live, together, in, groups, while, mature, males, bulls, live, solitary, lives, outside, of, the, mating, season, the, females, cooperate, to, protect, and, nurse, their, young, females, give, birth, every, four, to, twenty, years, and, care, for, the, calves, for, more, than, a, decade, a, mature, healthy, sperm, whale, has, no, natural, predators, although, calves, and, weakened, adults, are, sometimes, killed, by, pods, of, killer, whales, orcas, mature, males, average, 16, metres, 52, ft, in, length, with, the, head, representing, up, to, one, third, of, the, animal, s, length, plunging, to, 2, 250, metres, 7, 380, ft, it, is, the, third, deepest, diving, mammal, exceeded, only, by, the, southern, elephant, seal, and, cuvier, s, beaked, whale, the, sperm, whale, uses, echolocation, and, vocalization, with, source, level, as, loud, as, 236, decibels, re, 1, pa, m, underwater, the, loudest, of, any, animal, it, has, the, largest, brain, on, earth, more, than, five, times, heavier, than, a, human, s, sperm, whales, can, live, 70, years, or, more, sperm, whales, heads, are, filled, with, a, waxy, substance, called, spermaceti, sperm, oil, from, which, the, whale, derives, its, name, spermaceti, was, a, prime, target, of, the, whaling, industry, and, was, sought, after, for, use, in, oil, lamps, lubricants, and, candles, ambergris, a, solid, waxy, waste, product, sometimes, present, in, its, digestive, system, is, still, highly, valued, as, a, fixative, in, perfumes, among, other, uses, beachcombers, look, out, for, ambergris, as, flotsam, sperm, whaling, was, a, major, industry, in, the, 19th, century, depicted, in, the, novel, moby, dick, the, species, is, protected, by, the, international, whaling, commission, moratorium, and, is, listed, as, vulnerable, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, the, name, sperm, whale, is, a, clipping, of, spermaceti, whale, spermaceti, originally, mistakenly, identified, as, the, whales, semen, is, the, semi, liquid, waxy, substance, found, within, the, whale, s, head, see, spermaceti, organ, and, melon, below, the, sperm, whale, is, also, known, as, the, cachalot, which, is, thought, to, derive, from, the, archaic, french, for, tooth, or, big, teeth, as, preserved, for, example, in, the, word, caishau, in, the, gascon, dialect, a, word, of, either, romance, or, basque, origin, the, etymological, dictionary, of, corominas, says, the, origin, is, uncertain, but, it, suggests, that, it, comes, from, the, vulgar, latin, cappula, sword, hilts, the, word, cachalot, came, to, english, via, french, from, spanish, or, portuguese, cachalote, perhaps, from, galician, portuguese, cachola, big, head, the, term, is, retained, in, the, russian, word, for, the, animal, kashalot, as, well, as, in, many, other, languages, the, scientific, genus, name, physeter, comes, from, the, greek, phys, t, r, meaning, blowpipe, blowhole, of, a, whale, or, as, a, pars, pro, toto, whale, the, specific, name, macrocephalus, is, latinized, from, the, greek, makrok, phalos, big, headed, from, makros, kephal, its, synonymous, specific, name, catodon, means, down, tooth, from, the, greek, elements, cat, a, below, and, od, n, tooth, so, named, because, it, has, visible, teeth, only, in, its, lower, jaw, see, jaws, and, teeth, below, another, synonym, australasianus, australasian, was, applied, to, sperm, whales, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, sperm, whale, belongs, to, the, order, cetartiodactyla, the, order, containing, all, cetaceans, and, even, toed, ungulates, it, is, a, member, of, the, unranked, clade, cetacea, with, all, the, whales, dolphins, and, porpoises, and, further, classified, into, odontoceti, containing, all, the, toothed, whales, and, dolphins, it, is, the, sole, extant, species, of, its, genus, physeter, in, the, family, physeteridae, two, species, of, the, related, extant, genus, kogia, the, pygmy, sperm, whale, kogia, breviceps, and, the, dwarf, sperm, whale, k, sima, are, placed, either, in, this, family, or, in, the, family, kogiidae, in, some, taxonomic, schemes, the, families, kogiidae, and, physeteridae, are, combined, as, the, superfamily, physeteroidea, see, the, separate, entry, on, the, sperm, whale, family, swedish, ichthyologist, peter, artedi, described, it, as, physeter, catodon, in, his, 1738, work, genera, piscium, from, the, report, of, a, beached, specimen, in, orkney, in, 1693, and, two, beached, in, the, netherlands, in, 1598, and, 1601, the, 1598, specimen, was, near, berkhey, the, sperm, whale, is, one, of, the, species, originally, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, landmark, 1758, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, he, recognised, four, species, in, the, genus, physeter, experts, soon, realised, that, just, one, such, species, exists, although, there, has, been, debate, about, whether, this, should, be, named, p, catodon, or, p, macrocephalus, two, of, the, names, used, by, linnaeus, both, names, are, still, used, although, most, recent, authors, now, accept, macrocephalus, as, the, valid, name, limiting, catodon, s, status, to, a, lesser, synonym, until, 1974, the, species, was, generally, known, as, p, catodon, in, that, year, however, dutch, zoologists, antonius, m, husson, and, lipke, holthuis, proposed, that, the, correct, name, should, be, p, macrocephalus, the, second, name, in, the, genus, physeter, published, by, linnaeus, concurrently, with, p, catodon, this, proposition, was, based, on, the, grounds, that, the, names, were, synonyms, published, simultaneously, and, therefore, the, iczn, principle, of, the, first, reviser, should, apply, in, this, instance, it, led, to, the, choice, of, p, macrocephalus, over, p, catodon, a, view, re, stated, in, holthuis, 1987, this, has, been, adopted, by, most, subsequent, authors, although, schevill, 1986, and, 1987, argued, that, macrocephalus, was, published, with, an, inaccurate, description, and, that, therefore, only, the, species, catodon, was, valid, rendering, the, principle, of, first, reviser, inapplicable, the, most, recent, version, of, itis, has, altered, its, usage, from, p, catodon, to, p, macrocephalus, following, l, b, holthuis, and, more, recent, 2008, discussions, with, relevant, experts, furthermore, the, taxonomy, committee, of, the, society, for, marine, mammalogy, the, largest, international, association, of, marine, mammal, scientists, in, the, world, officially, uses, physeter, macrocephalus, when, publishing, their, definitive, list, of, marine, mammal, species, the, sperm, whale, is, the, largest, toothed, whale, and, is, among, the, most, sexually, dimorphic, of, all, cetaceans, both, sexes, are, about, the, same, size, at, birth, but, mature, males, are, typically, 30, to, 50, longer, and, three, times, as, massive, as, females, newborn, sperm, whales, are, usually, between, 3, 7, and, 4, 3, meters, 12, and, 14, ft, long, female, sperm, whales, are, sexually, mature, at, 8, to, 9, meters, 26, to, 30, ft, in, length, whilst, males, are, sexually, mature, at, 11, to, 12, meters, 36, to, 39, ft, female, sperm, whales, are, physically, mature, at, about, 10, 6, to, 11, meters, 35, to, 36, ft, in, length, and, generally, do, not, achieve, lengths, greater, than, 12, metres, 39, ft, the, largest, female, sperm, whale, measured, up, to, 12, 3, meters, 40, ft, long, and, an, individual, of, such, size, would, have, weighed, about, 17, tonnes, 19, short, tons, male, sperm, whales, are, physically, mature, at, about, 15, to, 16, meters, 49, to, 52, ft, in, length, and, larger, males, can, generally, achieve, 18, to, 19, meters, 59, to, 62, ft, an, 18, meters, 59, ft, long, male, sperm, whale, is, estimated, to, have, weighed, 57, tonnes, 56, long, tons, 63, short, tons, by, contrast, the, second, largest, toothed, whale, baird, s, beaked, whale, measures, up, to, 12, 8, meters, 42, ft, and, weighs, up, to, 14, tonnes, 15, short, tons, there, are, occasional, reports, of, individual, sperm, whales, achieving, even, greater, lengths, with, some, historical, claims, reaching, or, exceeding, 80, feet, 24, m, one, example, is, the, whale, that, sank, the, essex, one, of, the, incidents, behind, moby, dick, which, was, claimed, to, be, 85, feet, 26, m, however, there, is, disagreement, as, to, the, accuracy, of, some, of, these, claims, which, are, often, considered, exaggerations, or, as, being, measured, along, the, curves, of, the, body, an, individual, measuring, 20, 7, metres, 68, ft, was, reported, from, a, soviet, whaling, fleet, near, the, kuril, islands, in, 1950, and, is, cited, by, some, authors, as, the, largest, accurately, measured, it, has, been, estimated, to, weigh, 80, tonnes, 79, long, tons, 88, short, tons, in, a, review, of, size, variation, in, marine, megafauna, mcclain, and, colleagues, noted, that, the, international, whaling, commission, s, data, contained, eight, individuals, larger, than, 20, 7, metres, 68, ft, the, authors, supported, a, 24, metre, 79, ft, male, from, the, south, pacific, in, 1933, as, the, largest, recorded, however, sizes, like, these, are, rare, with, 95, of, recorded, sperm, whales, below, 15, 85, metres, 52, 0, ft, in, 1853, one, sperm, whale, was, reported, at, 62, feet, 19, m, in, length, with, a, head, measuring, 20, feet, 6, 1, m, large, lower, jawbones, are, held, in, the, british, natural, history, museum, and, the, oxford, university, museum, of, natural, history, measuring, 5, metres, 16, ft, and, 4, 7, metres, 15, ft, respectively, the, average, size, of, sperm, whales, has, decreased, over, the, years, probably, due, to, pressure, from, whaling, another, view, holds, that, exploitation, by, overwhaling, had, virtually, no, effect, on, the, size, of, the, bull, sperm, whales, and, their, size, may, have, actually, increased, in, current, times, on, the, basis, of, density, dependent, effects, old, males, taken, at, solander, islands, were, recorded, to, be, extremely, large, and, unusually, rich, in, blubbers, the, sperm, whale, s, unique, body, is, unlikely, to, be, confused, with, any, other, species, the, sperm, whale, s, distinctive, shape, comes, from, its, very, large, block, shaped, head, which, can, be, one, quarter, to, one, third, of, the, animal, s, length, the, s, shaped, blowhole, is, located, very, close, to, the, front, of, the, head, and, shifted, to, the, whale, s, left, this, gives, rise, to, a, distinctive, bushy, forward, angled, spray, the, sperm, whale, s, flukes, tail, lobes, are, triangular, and, very, thick, proportionally, they, are, larger, than, that, of, any, other, cetacean, and, are, very, flexible, the, whale, lifts, its, flukes, high, out, of, the, water, as, it, begins, a, feeding, dive, it, has, a, series, of, ridges, on, the, back, s, caudal, third, instead, of, a, dorsal, fin, the, largest, ridge, was, called, the, hump, by, whalers, and, can, be, mistaken, for, a, dorsal, fin, because, of, its, shape, and, size, in, contrast, to, the, smooth, skin, of, most, large, whales, its, back, skin, is, usually, wrinkly, and, has, been, likened, to, a, prune, by, whale, watching, enthusiasts, albinos, have, been, reported, the, ribs, are, bound, to, the, spine, by, flexible, cartilage, which, allows, the, ribcage, to, collapse, rather, than, snap, under, high, pressure, while, sperm, whales, are, well, adapted, to, diving, repeated, dives, to, great, depths, have, long, term, effects, bones, show, the, same, avascular, necrosis, that, signals, decompression, sickness, in, humans, older, skeletons, showed, the, most, extensive, damage, whereas, calves, showed, no, damage, this, damage, may, indicate, that, sperm, whales, are, susceptible, to, decompression, sickness, and, sudden, surfacing, could, be, lethal, to, them, like, that, of, all, cetaceans, the, spine, of, the, sperm, whale, has, reduced, zygapophysial, joints, of, which, the, remnants, are, modified, and, are, positioned, higher, on, the, vertebral, dorsal, spinous, process, hugging, it, laterally, to, prevent, extensive, lateral, bending, and, facilitate, more, dorso, ventral, bending, these, evolutionary, modifications, make, the, spine, more, flexible, but, weaker, than, the, spines, of, terrestrial, vertebrates, like, many, cetaceans, the, sperm, whale, has, a, vestigial, pelvis, that, is, not, connected, to, the, spine, like, that, of, other, toothed, whales, the, skull, of, the, sperm, whale, is, asymmetrical, so, as, to, aid, echolocation, sound, waves, that, strike, the, whale, from, different, directions, will, not, be, channeled, in, the, same, way, within, the, basin, of, the, cranium, the, openings, of, the, bony, narial, tubes, from, which, the, nasal, passages, spring, are, skewed, towards, the, left, side, of, the, skull, the, sperm, whale, s, lower, jaw, is, very, narrow, and, underslung, the, sperm, whale, has, 18, to, 26, teeth, on, each, side, of, its, lower, jaw, which, fit, into, sockets, in, the, upper, jaw, the, teeth, are, cone, shaped, and, weigh, up, to, 1, kilogram, 2, 2, lb, each, the, teeth, are, functional, but, do, not, appear, to, be, necessary, for, capturing, or, eating, squid, as, well, fed, animals, have, been, found, without, teeth, or, even, with, deformed, jaws, one, hypothesis, is, that, the, teeth, are, used, in, aggression, between, males, mature, males, often, show, scars, which, seem, to, be, caused, by, the, teeth, rudimentary, teeth, are, also, present, in, the, upper, jaw, but, these, rarely, emerge, into, the, mouth, analyzing, the, teeth, is, the, preferred, method, for, determining, a, whale, s, age, like, the, age, rings, in, a, tree, the, teeth, build, distinct, layers, of, cementum, and, dentine, as, they, grow, the, sperm, whale, brain, is, the, largest, known, of, any, modern, or, extinct, animal, weighing, on, average, about, 7, 8, kilograms, 17, lb, with, the, smallest, known, weighing, 6, 4, kilograms, 14, lb, and, the, largest, known, weighing, 9, 2, kilograms, 20, lb, more, than, five, times, heavier, than, a, human, brain, and, has, a, volume, of, about, 8, 000, cm, 3, although, larger, brains, generally, correlate, with, higher, intelligence, it, is, not, the, only, factor, elephants, and, dolphins, also, have, larger, brains, than, humans, the, sperm, whale, has, a, lower, encephalization, quotient, than, many, other, whale, and, dolphin, species, lower, than, that, of, non, human, anthropoid, apes, and, much, lower, than, that, of, humans, the, sperm, whale, s, cerebrum, is, the, largest, in, all, mammalia, both, in, absolute, and, relative, terms, the, olfactory, system, is, reduced, suggesting, that, the, sperm, whale, has, a, poor, sense, of, taste, and, smell, by, contrast, the, auditory, system, is, enlarged, the, pyramidal, tract, is, poorly, developed, reflecting, the, reduction, of, its, limbs, the, sperm, whale, respiratory, system, has, adapted, to, cope, with, drastic, pressure, changes, when, diving, the, flexible, ribcage, allows, lung, collapse, reducing, nitrogen, intake, and, metabolism, can, decrease, to, conserve, oxygen, between, dives, the, sperm, whale, surfaces, to, breathe, for, about, eight, minutes, before, diving, again, odontoceti, toothed, whales, breathe, air, at, the, surface, through, a, single, s, shaped, blowhole, which, is, extremely, skewed, to, the, left, sperm, whales, spout, breathe, 3, 5, times, per, minute, at, rest, increasing, to, 6, 7, times, per, minute, after, a, dive, the, blow, is, a, noisy, single, stream, that, rises, up, to, 2, metres, 6, 6, ft, or, more, above, the, surface, and, points, forward, and, left, at, a, 45, angle, on, average, females, and, juveniles, blow, every, 12, 5, seconds, before, dives, while, large, males, blow, every, 17, 5, seconds, before, dives, a, sperm, whale, killed, 160, km, 100, mi, south, of, durban, south, africa, after, a, 1, hour, 50, minute, dive, was, found, with, two, dogfish, scymnodon, sp, usually, found, at, the, sea, floor, in, its, belly, the, sperm, whale, has, the, longest, intestinal, system, in, the, world, exceeding, 300, m, in, larger, specimens, the, sperm, whale, has, a, four, chambered, stomach, that, is, similar, to, ruminants, the, first, secretes, no, gastric, juices, and, has, very, thick, muscular, walls, to, crush, the, food, since, whales, cannot, chew, and, resist, the, claw, and, sucker, attacks, of, swallowed, squid, the, second, chamber, is, larger, and, is, where, digestion, takes, place, undigested, squid, beaks, accumulate, in, the, second, chamber, as, many, as, 18, 000, have, been, found, in, some, dissected, specimens, most, squid, beaks, are, vomited, by, the, whale, but, some, occasionally, make, it, to, the, hindgut, such, beaks, precipitate, the, formation, of, ambergris, in, 1959, the, heart, of, a, 22, metric, ton, 24, short, ton, male, taken, by, whalers, was, measured, to, be, 116, kilograms, 256, lb, about, 0, 5, of, its, total, mass, the, circulatory, system, has, a, number, of, specific, adaptations, for, the, aquatic, environment, the, diameter, of, the, aortic, arch, increases, as, it, leaves, the, heart, this, bulbous, expansion, acts, as, a, windkessel, ensuring, a, steady, blood, flow, as, the, heart, rate, slows, during, diving, the, arteries, that, leave, the, aortic, arch, are, positioned, symmetrically, there, is, no, costocervical, artery, there, is, no, direct, connection, between, the, internal, carotid, artery, and, the, vessels, of, the, brain, their, circulatory, system, has, adapted, to, dive, at, great, depths, as, much, as, 2, 250, metres, 7, 382, ft, for, up, to, 120, minutes, more, typical, dives, are, around, 400, metres, 1, 310, ft, and, 35, minutes, in, duration, myoglobin, which, stores, oxygen, in, muscle, tissue, is, much, more, abundant, than, in, terrestrial, animals, the, blood, has, a, high, density, of, red, blood, cells, which, contain, oxygen, carrying, haemoglobin, the, oxygenated, blood, can, be, directed, towards, only, the, brain, and, other, essential, organs, when, oxygen, levels, deplete, the, spermaceti, organ, may, also, play, a, role, by, adjusting, buoyancy, see, below, the, arterial, retia, mirabilia, are, extraordinarily, well, developed, the, complex, arterial, retia, mirabilia, of, the, sperm, whale, are, more, extensive, and, larger, than, those, of, any, other, cetacean, atop, the, whale, s, skull, is, positioned, a, large, complex, of, organs, filled, with, a, liquid, mixture, of, fats, and, waxes, called, spermaceti, the, purpose, of, this, complex, is, to, generate, powerful, and, focused, clicking, sounds, the, existence, of, which, was, proven, by, valentine, worthington, and, william, schevill, when, a, recording, was, produced, on, a, research, vessel, in, may, 1959, the, sperm, whale, uses, these, sounds, for, echolocation, and, communication, the, spermaceti, organ, is, like, a, large, barrel, of, spermaceti, its, surrounding, wall, known, as, the, case, is, extremely, tough, and, fibrous, the, case, can, hold, within, it, up, to, 1, 900, litres, of, spermaceti, it, is, proportionately, larger, in, males, this, oil, is, a, mixture, of, triglycerides, and, wax, esters, it, has, been, suggested, that, it, is, homologous, to, the, dorsal, bursa, organ, found, in, dolphins, the, proportion, of, wax, esters, in, the, spermaceti, organ, increases, with, the, age, of, the, whale, 38, 51, in, calves, 58, 87, in, adult, females, and, 71, 94, in, adult, males, the, spermaceti, at, the, core, of, the, organ, has, a, higher, wax, content, than, the, outer, areas, the, speed, of, sound, in, spermaceti, is, 2, 684, m, s, at, 40, khz, 36, c, making, it, nearly, twice, as, fast, as, in, the, oil, in, a, dolphin, s, melon, below, the, spermaceti, organ, lies, the, junk, which, consists, of, compartments, of, spermaceti, separated, by, cartilage, it, is, analogous, to, the, melon, found, in, other, toothed, whales, the, structure, of, the, junk, redistributes, physical, stress, across, the, skull, and, may, have, evolved, to, protect, the, head, during, ramming, running, through, the, head, are, two, air, passages, the, left, passage, runs, alongside, the, spermaceti, organ, and, goes, directly, to, the, blowhole, whilst, the, right, passage, runs, underneath, the, spermaceti, organ, and, passes, air, through, a, pair, of, phonic, lips, and, into, the, distal, sac, at, the, very, front, of, the, nose, the, distal, sac, is, connected, to, the, blowhole, and, the, terminus, of, the, left, passage, when, the, whale, is, submerged, it, can, close, the, blowhole, and, air, that, passes, through, the, phonic, lips, can, circulate, back, to, the, lungs, the, sperm, whale, unlike, other, odontocetes, has, only, one, pair, of, phonic, lips, whereas, all, other, toothed, whales, have, two, and, it, is, located, at, the, front, of, the, nose, instead, of, behind, the, melon, at, the, posterior, end, of, this, spermaceti, complex, is, the, frontal, sac, which, covers, the, concave, surface, of, the, cranium, the, posterior, wall, of, the, frontal, sac, is, covered, with, fluid, filled, knobs, which, are, about, 4, 13, mm, in, diameter, and, separated, by, narrow, grooves, the, anterior, wall, is, smooth, the, knobbly, surface, reflects, sound, waves, that, come, through, the, spermaceti, organ, from, the, phonic, lips, the, grooves, between, the, knobs, trap, a, film, of, air, that, is, consistent, whatever, the, orientation, or, depth, of, the, whale, making, it, an, excellent, sound, mirror, the, spermaceti, organs, may, also, help, adjust, the, whale, s, buoyancy, it, is, hypothesized, that, before, the, whale, dives, cold, water, enters, the, organ, and, it, is, likely, that, the, blood, vessels, constrict, reducing, blood, flow, and, hence, temperature, the, wax, therefore, solidifies, and, reduces, in, volume, the, increase, in, specific, density, generates, a, down, force, of, about, 392, newtons, 88, lb, f, and, allows, the, whale, to, dive, with, less, effort, during, the, hunt, oxygen, consumption, together, with, blood, vessel, dilation, produces, heat, and, melts, the, spermaceti, increasing, its, buoyancy, and, enabling, easy, surfacing, however, more, recent, work, has, found, many, problems, with, this, theory, including, the, lack, of, anatomical, structures, for, the, actual, heat, exchange, another, issue, is, that, if, the, spermaceti, does, indeed, cool, and, solidify, it, would, affect, the, whale, s, echolocation, ability, just, when, it, needs, it, to, hunt, in, the, depths, herman, melville, s, fictional, story, moby, dick, suggests, that, the, case, containing, the, spermaceti, serves, as, a, battering, ram, for, use, in, fights, between, males, a, few, famous, instances, include, the, well, documented, sinking, of, the, ships, essex, and, ann, alexander, by, attackers, estimated, to, weigh, only, one, fifth, as, much, as, the, ships, the, sperm, whale, s, eye, does, not, differ, greatly, from, those, of, other, toothed, whales, except, in, size, it, is, the, largest, among, the, toothed, whales, weighing, about, 170, g, it, is, overall, ellipsoid, in, shape, compressed, along, the, visual, axis, measuring, about, 7, 7, 3, cm, the, cornea, is, elliptical, and, the, lens, is, spherical, the, sclera, is, very, hard, and, thick, roughly, 1, cm, anteriorly, and, 3, cm, posteriorly, there, are, no, ciliary, muscles, the, choroid, is, very, thick, and, contains, a, fibrous, tapetum, lucidum, like, other, toothed, whales, the, sperm, whale, can, retract, and, protrude, its, eyes, thanks, to, a, 2, cm, thick, retractor, muscle, attached, around, the, eye, at, the, equator, but, are, unable, to, roll, the, eyes, in, their, sockets, according, to, fristrup, and, harbison, 2002, sperm, whale, s, eyes, afford, good, vision, and, sensitivity, to, light, they, conjectured, that, sperm, whales, use, vision, to, hunt, squid, either, by, detecting, silhouettes, from, below, or, by, detecting, bioluminescence, if, sperm, whales, detect, silhouettes, fristrup, and, harbison, suggested, that, they, hunt, upside, down, allowing, them, to, use, the, forward, parts, of, the, ventral, visual, fields, for, binocular, vision, for, some, time, researchers, have, been, aware, that, pods, of, sperm, whales, may, sleep, for, short, periods, assuming, a, vertical, position, with, their, heads, just, below, or, at, the, surface, or, head, down, a, 2008, study, published, in, current, biology, recorded, evidence, that, whales, may, sleep, with, both, sides, of, the, brain, it, appears, that, some, whales, may, fall, into, a, deep, sleep, for, about, 7, percent, of, the, time, most, often, between, 6, p, m, and, midnight, sperm, whales, have, 21, pairs, of, chromosomes, 2n, 42, the, genome, of, live, whales, can, be, examined, by, recovering, shed, skin, after, valentine, worthington, and, william, e, schevill, confirmed, the, existence, of, sperm, whale, vocalization, further, studies, found, that, sperm, whales, are, capable, of, emitting, sounds, at, a, source, level, of, 230, decibels, making, the, sperm, whale, the, loudest, animal, in, the, world, when, echolocating, the, sperm, whale, emits, a, directionally, focused, beam, of, broadband, clicks, clicks, are, generated, by, forcing, air, through, a, pair, of, phonic, lips, also, known, as, monkey, lips, or, museau, de, singe, at, the, front, end, of, the, nose, just, below, the, blowhole, the, sound, then, travels, backwards, along, the, length, of, the, nose, through, the, spermaceti, organ, most, of, the, sound, energy, is, then, reflected, off, the, frontal, sac, at, the, cranium, and, into, the, melon, whose, lens, like, structure, focuses, it, some, of, the, sound, will, reflect, back, into, the, spermaceti, organ, and, back, towards, the, front, of, the, whale, s, nose, where, it, will, be, reflected, through, the, spermaceti, organ, a, third, time, this, back, and, forth, reflection, which, happens, on, the, scale, of, a, few, milliseconds, creates, a, multi, pulse, click, structure, this, multi, pulse, click, structure, allows, researchers, to, measure, the, whale, s, spermaceti, organ, using, only, the, sound, of, its, clicks, because, the, interval, between, pulses, of, a, sperm, whale, s, click, is, related, to, the, length, of, the, sound, producing, organ, an, individual, whale, s, click, is, unique, to, that, individual, however, if, the, whale, matures, and, the, size, of, the, spermaceti, organ, increases, the, tone, of, the, whale, s, click, will, also, change, the, lower, jaw, is, the, primary, reception, path, for, the, echoes, a, continuous, fat, filled, canal, transmits, received, sounds, to, the, inner, ear, the, source, of, the, air, forced, through, the, phonic, lips, is, the, right, nasal, passage, while, the, left, nasal, passage, opens, to, the, blow, hole, the, right, nasal, passage, has, evolved, to, supply, air, to, the, phonic, lips, it, is, thought, that, the, nostrils, of, the, land, based, ancestor, of, the, sperm, whale, migrated, through, evolution, to, their, current, functions, the, left, nostril, becoming, the, blowhole, and, the, right, nostril, becoming, the, phonic, lips, air, that, passes, through, the, phonic, lips, passes, into, the, distal, sac, then, back, down, through, the, left, nasal, passage, this, recycling, of, air, allows, the, whale, to, continuously, generate, clicks, for, as, long, as, it, is, submerged, the, sperm, whale, s, vocalizations, are, all, based, on, clicking, described, in, four, types, the, usual, echolocation, creaks, codas, and, slow, clicks, the, usual, echolocation, click, type, is, used, in, searching, for, prey, a, creak, is, a, rapid, series, of, high, frequency, clicks, that, sounds, somewhat, like, a, creaky, door, hinge, it, is, typically, used, when, homing, in, on, prey, slow, clicks, are, heard, only, in, the, presence, of, males, it, is, not, certain, whether, females, occasionally, make, them, males, make, a, lot, of, slow, clicks, in, breeding, grounds, 74, of, the, time, both, near, the, surface, and, at, depth, which, suggests, they, are, primarily, mating, signals, outside, breeding, grounds, slow, clicks, are, rarely, heard, and, usually, near, the, surface, the, most, distinctive, vocalizations, are, codas, which, are, short, rhythmic, sequences, of, clicks, mostly, numbering, 3, 12, clicks, in, stereotyped, patterns, they, are, classified, using, variations, in, the, number, of, clicks, rhythm, and, tempo, codas, are, the, result, of, vocal, learning, within, a, stable, social, group, and, are, made, in, the, context, of, the, whales, social, unit, the, foundation, of, sperm, whale, society, is, the, matrilineally, based, social, unit, of, ten, or, so, females, and, their, offspring, the, members, of, the, unit, travel, together, suckle, each, others, infants, and, babysit, them, while, mothers, make, long, deep, dives, to, feed, over, 70, of, a, sperm, whale, s, time, is, spent, independently, foraging, codas, could, help, whales, reunite, and, reaffirm, their, social, ties, in, between, long, foraging, dives, while, nonidentity, codas, are, commonly, used, in, multiple, different, clans, some, codas, express, clan, identity, and, denote, different, patterns, of, travel, foraging, and, socializing, or, avoidance, among, clans, in, particular, whales, will, not, group, with, whales, of, another, clan, even, though, they, share, the, same, geographical, area, statistically, as, the, clans, ranges, become, more, overlapped, the, distinction, in, clan, identity, coda, usage, becomes, more, pronounced, distinctive, codas, identify, seven, clans, described, among, the, approximately, 150, 000, female, sperm, whales, in, the, pacific, ocean, and, there, are, another, four, clans, in, the, atlantic, as, arbitrary, traits, that, function, as, reliable, indicators, of, cultural, group, membership, clan, identity, codas, act, as, symbolic, markers, that, modulate, interactions, between, individuals, individual, identity, in, sperm, whale, vocalizations, is, an, ongoing, scientific, issue, however, a, distinction, needs, to, be, made, between, cues, and, signals, human, acoustic, tools, can, distinguish, individual, whales, by, analyzing, micro, characteristics, of, their, vocalizations, and, the, whales, can, probably, do, the, same, this, does, not, prove, that, the, whales, deliberately, use, some, vocalizations, to, signal, individual, identity, in, the, manner, of, the, signature, whistles, that, bottlenose, dolphins, use, as, individual, labels, sperm, whales, are, among, the, most, cosmopolitan, species, they, prefer, ice, free, waters, over, 1, 000, metres, 3, 300, ft, deep, although, both, sexes, range, through, temperate, and, tropical, oceans, and, seas, only, adult, males, populate, higher, latitudes, among, several, regions, such, as, along, coastal, waters, of, southern, australia, sperm, whales, have, been, considered, to, be, locally, extinct, they, are, relatively, abundant, from, the, poles, to, the, equator, and, are, found, in, all, the, oceans, they, inhabit, the, mediterranean, sea, but, not, the, black, sea, while, their, presence, in, the, red, sea, is, uncertain, the, shallow, entrances, to, both, the, black, sea, and, the, red, sea, may, account, for, their, absence, the, black, sea, s, lower, layers, are, also, anoxic, and, contain, high, concentrations, of, sulphur, compounds, such, as, hydrogen, sulphide, the, first, ever, sighting, off, the, coast, of, pakistan, was, made, in, 2017, the, first, ever, record, off, the, west, coast, of, the, korean, peninsula, yellow, sea, was, made, in, 2005, followed, by, one, near, ganghwa, island, in, 2009, populations, are, denser, close, to, continental, shelves, and, canyons, sperm, whales, are, usually, found, in, deep, off, shore, waters, but, may, be, seen, closer, to, shore, in, areas, where, the, continental, shelf, is, small, and, drops, quickly, to, depths, of, 310, to, 920, metres, 1, 020, to, 3, 020, ft, coastal, areas, with, significant, sperm, whale, populations, include, the, azores, and, dominica, in, east, asian, waters, whales, are, also, observed, regularly, in, coastal, waters, in, places, such, as, the, commander, and, kuril, islands, shiretoko, peninsula, which, is, one, of, few, locations, where, sperm, whales, can, be, observed, from, shores, off, kinkasan, vicinity, to, tokyo, bay, and, the, b, s, peninsula, to, the, izu, and, the, izu, islands, the, volcano, islands, yakushima, and, the, tokara, islands, to, the, ryukyu, islands, taiwan, the, northern, mariana, islands, and, so, forth, historical, catch, records, suggest, there, could, have, been, smaller, aggression, grounds, in, the, sea, of, japan, as, well, along, the, korean, peninsula, the, first, confirmed, observation, within, the, sea, of, japan, eight, animals, off, guryongpo, was, made, in, 2004, since, after, the, last, catches, of, five, whales, off, ulsan, in, 1911, while, nine, whales, were, observed, in, the, east, china, sea, side, of, the, peninsula, in, 1999, grown, males, are, known, to, enter, surprisingly, shallow, bays, to, rest, whales, will, be, in, a, state, of, rest, during, these, occasions, unique, coastal, groups, have, been, reported, from, various, areas, around, the, globe, such, as, near, scotland, s, coastal, waters, and, the, shiretoko, peninsula, off, kaik, ura, in, davao, gulf, such, coastal, groups, were, more, abundant, in, pre, whaling, days, genetic, analysis, indicates, that, the, world, population, of, sperm, whales, originated, in, the, pacific, ocean, from, a, population, of, about, 10, 000, animals, around, 100, 000, years, ago, when, expanding, ice, caps, blocked, off, their, access, to, other, seas, in, particular, colonization, of, the, atlantic, was, revealed, to, have, occurred, multiple, times, during, this, expansion, of, their, range, sperm, whales, usually, dive, between, 300, and, 800, metres, 980, and, 2, 620, ft, and, sometimes, 1, to, 2, kilometres, 3, 300, to, 6, 600, ft, in, search, of, food, such, dives, can, last, more, than, an, hour, they, feed, on, several, species, notably, the, giant, squid, but, also, the, colossal, squid, octopuses, and, fish, such, as, demersal, rays, and, sharks, but, their, diet, is, mainly, medium, sized, squid, sperm, whales, may, also, possibly, prey, upon, swordfish, on, rare, occasions, some, prey, may, be, taken, accidentally, while, eating, other, items, most, of, what, is, known, about, deep, sea, squid, has, been, learned, from, specimens, in, captured, sperm, whale, stomachs, although, more, recent, studies, analysed, faeces, one, study, carried, out, around, the, gal, pagos, found, that, squid, from, the, genera, histioteuthis, 62, ancistrocheirus, 16, and, octopoteuthis, 7, weighing, between, 12, and, 650, grams, 0, 026, and, 1, 433, lb, were, the, most, commonly, taken, battles, between, sperm, whales, and, giant, squid, or, colossal, squid, have, never, been, observed, by, humans, however, white, scars, are, believed, to, be, caused, by, the, large, squid, one, study, published, in, 2010, collected, evidence, that, suggests, that, female, sperm, whales, may, collaborate, when, hunting, humboldt, squid, tagging, studies, have, shown, that, sperm, whales, hunt, upside, down, at, the, bottom, of, their, deep, dives, it, is, suggested, that, the, whales, can, see, the, squid, silhouetted, above, them, against, the, dim, surface, light, an, older, study, examining, whales, captured, by, the, new, zealand, whaling, fleet, in, the, cook, strait, region, found, a, 1, 69, 1, ratio, of, squid, to, fish, by, weight, sperm, whales, sometimes, take, sablefish, and, toothfish, from, long, lines, long, line, fishing, operations, in, the, gulf, of, alaska, complain, that, sperm, whales, take, advantage, of, their, fishing, operations, to, eat, desirable, species, straight, off, the, line, sparing, the, whales, the, need, to, hunt, however, the, amount, of, fish, taken, is, very, little, compared, to, what, the, sperm, whale, needs, per, day, video, footage, has, been, captured, of, a, large, male, sperm, whale, bouncing, a, long, line, to, gain, the, fish, sperm, whales, are, believed, to, prey, on, the, megamouth, shark, a, rare, and, large, deep, sea, species, discovered, in, the, 1970s, in, one, case, three, sperm, whales, were, observed, attacking, or, playing, with, a, megamouth, sperm, whales, have, also, been, noted, to, feed, on, bioluminescent, pyrosomes, such, as, pyrosoma, atlanticum, it, is, thought, that, the, foraging, strategy, of, sperm, whales, for, bioluminescent, squids, may, also, explain, the, presence, of, these, light, emitting, pyrosomes, in, the, diet, of, the, sperm, whale, the, sharp, beak, of, a, consumed, squid, lodged, in, the, whale, s, intestine, may, lead, to, the, production, of, ambergris, analogous, to, the, production, of, pearls, in, oysters, the, irritation, of, the, intestines, caused, by, squid, beaks, stimulates, the, secretion, of, this, lubricant, like, substance, sperm, whales, are, prodigious, feeders, and, eat, around, 3, of, their, body, weight, per, day, the, total, annual, consumption, of, prey, by, sperm, whales, worldwide, is, estimated, to, be, about, 272, million, tonnes, 300, million, short, tons, in, comparison, human, consumption, of, seafood, is, estimated, to, be, 157, million, tonnes, 173, million, short, tons, sperm, whales, hunt, through, echolocation, their, clicks, are, among, the, most, powerful, sounds, in, the, animal, kingdom, see, above, it, has, been, hypothesised, that, it, can, stun, prey, with, its, clicks, experimental, studies, attempting, to, duplicate, this, effect, have, been, unable, to, replicate, the, supposed, injuries, casting, doubt, on, this, idea, one, study, showing, that, sound, pressure, levels, on, the, squid, are, more, than, an, order, of, magnitude, below, levels, required, for, debilitation, and, therefore, precluding, acoustic, stunning, to, facilitate, prey, capture, sperm, whales, as, well, as, other, large, cetaceans, help, fertilise, the, surface, of, the, ocean, by, consuming, nutrients, in, the, depths, and, transporting, those, nutrients, to, the, oceans, surface, when, they, defecate, an, effect, known, as, the, whale, pump, this, fertilises, phytoplankton, and, other, plants, on, the, surface, of, the, ocean, and, contributes, to, ocean, productivity, and, the, drawdown, of, atmospheric, carbon, sperm, whales, can, live, 70, years, or, more, they, are, a, prime, example, of, a, species, that, has, been, k, selected, meaning, their, reproductive, strategy, is, associated, with, stable, environmental, conditions, and, comprises, a, low, birth, rate, significant, parental, aid, to, offspring, slow, maturation, and, high, longevity, how, they, choose, mates, has, not, been, definitively, determined, bulls, will, fight, with, each, other, over, females, and, males, will, mate, with, multiple, females, making, them, polygynous, but, they, do, not, dominate, the, group, as, in, a, harem, bulls, do, not, provide, paternal, care, to, their, offspring, but, rather, play, a, fatherly, role, to, younger, bulls, to, show, dominance, females, become, fertile, at, around, 9, years, of, age, the, oldest, pregnant, female, ever, recorded, was, 41, years, old, gestation, requires, 14, to, 16,

but, calves, rarely, may, suckle, up, to, 13, years, like, that, of, other, whales, the, sperm, whale, s, milk, has, a, higher, fat, content, than, that, of, terrestrial, mammals, about, 36, compared, to, 4, in, cow, milk, this, gives, it, a, consistency, similar, to, cottage, cheese, which, prevents, it, from, dissolving, in, the, water, before, the, calf, can, drink, it, it, has, an, energy,

males, reach, their, full, size, at, about, age, 50, like, elephants, females, and, their, young, live, in, matriarchal, groups, called, pods, while, bulls, live, apart, bulls, sometimes, form, loose, bachelor, groups, with, other, males, of, similar, age, and, size, as, they, grow, older, they, typically, live, solitary, lives, only, returning, to, the, pod, to, socialize, or, to, breed, bulls, have, beached, themselves, together, suggesting, a, degree, of, cooperation, which, is, not, yet, fully, understood, the, whales, rarely, if, ever, leave, their, group, a, social, unit, is, a, group, of, sperm, whales, who, live, and, travel, together, over, a, period, of, years, individuals, rarely, if, ever, join, or, leave, a, social, unit, there, is, a, huge, variance, in, the, size, of, social, units, they, are, most, commonly, between, six, and, nine, individuals, in, size, but, can, have, more, than, twenty, unlike, orcas, sperm, whales, within, a, social, unit, show, no, significant, tendency, to, associate, with, their, genetic, relatives, females, and, calves, spend, about, three, quarters, of, their, time, foraging, and, a, quarter, of, their, time, socializing,

against, each, other, tracking, of, diving, whales, suggests, that, groups, engage, in, herding, of, prey, similar, to, bait, balls, created, by, other, species, though, the, research, needs, to, be, confirmed, by, tracking, the, prey, the, most, common, natural, predator, of, sperm, whales, is, the, orca, killer, whale, but, pilot, whales, and, false, killer, whales, sometimes, harass, them,

capable, of, delivering, lethal, blows, alternatively, they, may, face, outwards, the, heads, out, formation, other, than, sperm, whales, southern, right, whales, had, been, observed, to, perform, similar, formations, however, formations, in, non, dangerous, situations, have, been, recorded, as, well, early, whalers, exploited, this, behaviour, attracting, a, whole, unit, by, injuring, one, of, its, members, such, a, tactic, is, described, in, moby, dick, say, you, strike, a, forty, barrel, bull, poor, devil, all, his, comrades, quit, him, but, strike, a, member, of, the, harem, school, and, her, companions, swim, around, her, with, every, token, of, concern, sometimes, lingering, so, near, her, and, so, long, as, themselves, to, fall, a, prey, if, the, killer, whale, pod, is, large, its, members, may, sometimes, be, able, to, kill, adult, female, sperm, whales, and, can, at, least, injure, an, entire, pod, of, sperm, whales, bulls, have, no, predators, and, are, believed, to, be, too, large, powerful, and, aggressive, to, be, threatened, by, killer, whales, solitary, bulls, are, known, to, interfere, and, come, to, the, aid, of, vulnerable, groups, nearby, however, the, bull, sperm, whale, when, accompanying, pods, of, female, sperm, whales, and, their, calves, as, such, may, be, reportedly, unable, to, effectively, dissuade, killer, whales, from, their, attacks, on, the, group, although, the, killer, whales, may, end, the, attack, sooner, when, a, bull, is, present, however, male, sperm, whales, have, been, observed, to, attack, and, intimidate, killer, whale, pods, in, competitive, feeding, instances, an, incident, was, filmed, from, a, long, line, trawler, a, killer, whale, pod, was, systematically, taking, fish, caught, on, the, trawler, s, long, lines, as, the, lines, were, being, pulled, into, the, ship, when, a, male, sperm, whale, appeared, to, repeatedly, charge, the, killer, whale, pod, in, an, attempt, to, drive, them, away, it, was, speculated, by, the, film, crew, that, the, sperm, whale, was, attempting, to, access, the, same, fish, the, killer, whales, employed, a, tail, outward, and, tail, slapping, defensive, position, against, the, bull, sperm, whale, similar, to, that, used, by, female, sperm, whales, against, attacking, killer, whales, however, at, some, potential, feeding, sites, the, killer, whales, may, prevail, over, sperm, whales, even, when, outnumbered, by, the, sperm, whales, some, authors, consider, the, killer, whales, usually, behaviorally, dominant, over, sperm, whales, but, express, that, the, two, species, are, fairly, evenly, matched, with, the, killer, whales, greater, aggression, more, considerable, biting, force, for, their, size, and, predatory, prowess, more, than, compensating, for, their, smaller, size, sperm, whales, are, not, known, for, forging, bonds, with, other, species, but, it, was, observed, that, a, bottlenose, dolphin, with, a, spinal, deformity, had, been, accepted, into, a, pod, of, sperm, whales, they, are, known, to, swim, alongside, other, cetaceans, such, as, humpback, fin, minke, pilot, and, killer, whales, on, occasion, sperm, whales, can, suffer, from, parasites, out, of, 35, sperm, whales, caught, during, the, 1976, 1977, antarctic, whaling, season, all, of, them, were, infected, by, anisakis, physeteris, in, their, stomachs, and, phyllobothrium, delphini, in, their, blubber, both, whales, with, a, placenta, were, infected, with, placentonema, gigantissima, potentially, the, largest, nematode, worm, ever, described, other, physeteroidea,

whales, although, the, fossil, record, is, poor, several, extinct, genera, have, been, assigned, to, the, clade, physeteroidea, which, includes, the, last, common, ancestor, of, the, modern, sperm, whale, pygmy, sperm, whales, dwarf, sperm, whales, and, extinct, physeteroids, these, fossils, include, ferecetotherium, idiorophus, diaphorocetus, aulophyseter, orycterocetus, scaldicetus, placoziphius, zygophyseter, and, acrophyseter, ferecetotherium, found, in, azerbaijan, and, dated, to, the, late, oligocene, about, 28, to, 23, million, years, ago, is, the, most, primitive, fossil, that, has, been, found, which, possesses, sperm, whale, specific, features, such, as, an, asymmetric, rostrum, beak, or, snout, most, sperm, whale, fossils, date, from, the, miocene, period, 23, to, 5, million, years, ago, diaphorocetus, from, argentina, has, been, dated, to, the, early, miocene, fossil, sperm, whales, from, the, middle, miocene, include, aulophyseter, idiorophus, and, orycterocetus, all, of, which, were, found, on, the, west, coast, of, the, united, states, and, scaldicetus, found, in, europe, and, japan, orycterocetus, fossils, have, also, been, found, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, and, the, mediterranean, sea, in, addition, to, the, west, coast, of, the, united, states, placoziphius, found, in, europe, and, acrophyseter, from, peru, are, dated, to, the, late, miocene, fossil, sperm, whales, differ, from, modern, sperm, whales, in, tooth, count, and, the, shape, of, the, face, and, jaws, for, example, scaldicetus, had, a, tapered, rostrum, genera, from, the, oligocene, and, early, and, middle, miocene, with, the, possible, exception, of, aulophyseter, had, teeth, in, their, upper, jaws, acrophyseter, from, the, late, miocene, also, had, teeth, in, both, the, upper, and, lower, jaws, as, well, as, a, short, rostrum, and, an, upward, curving, mandible, lower, jaw, these, anatomical, differences, suggest, that, fossil, species, may, not, have, necessarily, been, deep, sea, squid, eaters, such, as, the, modern, sperm, whale, but, that, some, genera, mainly, ate, fish, zygophyseter, dated, from, the, middle, to, late, miocene, and, found, in, southern, italy, had, teeth, in, both, jaws, and, appears, to, have, been, adapted, to, feed, on, large, prey, rather, like, the, modern, killer, whale, orca, other, fossil, sperm, whales, with, adaptations, similar, to, this, are, collectively, known, as, killer, sperm, whales, two, poorly, known, fossil, species, belonging, to, the, modern, genus, physeter, have, been, recognized, so, far, p, antiquus, neogene, of, france, and, p, vetus, neogene, of, eastern, north, america, physeter, vetus, is, very, likely, an, invalid, species, as, the, few, teeth, that, were, used, to, identify, this, species, appear, to, be, identical, to, those, of, another, toothed, whale, orycterocetus, quadratidens, the, traditional, view, has, been, that, mysticeti, baleen, whales, and, odontoceti, toothed, whales, arose, from, more, primitive, whales, early, in, the, oligocene, period, and, that, the, super, family, physeteroidea, which, contains, the, sperm, whale, dwarf, sperm, whale, and, pygmy, sperm, whale, diverged, from, other, toothed, whales, soon, after, that, over, 23, million, years, ago, from, 1993, to, 1996, molecular, phylogenetics, analyses, by, milinkovitch, and, colleagues, based, on, comparing, the, genes, of, various, modern, whales, suggested, that, the, sperm, whales, are, more, closely, related, to, the, baleen, whales, than, they, are, to, other, toothed, whales, which, would, have, meant, that, odontoceti, were, not, monophyletic, in, other, words, it, did, not, consist, of, a, single, ancestral, toothed, whale, species, and, all, its, descendants, however, more, recent, studies, based, on, various, combinations, of, comparative, anatomy, and, molecular, phylogenetics, criticised, milinkovitch, s, analysis, on, technical, grounds, and, reaffirmed, that, the, odontoceti, are, monophyletic, these, analyses, also, confirm, that, there, was, a, rapid, evolutionary, radiation, diversification, of, the, physeteroidea, in, the, miocene, period, the, kogiidae, dwarf, and, pygmy, sperm, whales, diverged, from, the, physeteridae, true, sperm, whales, at, least, 8, million, years, ago, spermaceti, obtained, primarily, from, the, spermaceti, organ, and, sperm, oil, obtained, primarily, from, the, blubber, in, the, body, were, much, sought, after, by, 18th, 19th, and, 20th, century, whalers, these, substances, found, a, variety, of, commercial, applications, such, as, candles, soap, cosmetics, machine, oil, other, specialised, lubricants, lamp, oil, pencils, crayons, leather, waterproofing, rust, proofing, materials, and, many, pharmaceutical, compounds, ambergris, a, highly, expensive, solid, waxy, flammable, substance, produced, in, the, digestive, system, of, sperm, whales, was, also, sought, as, a, fixative, in, perfumery, prior, to, the, early, eighteenth, century, hunting, was, mostly, by, indigenous, indonesians, legend, has, it, that, sometime, in, the, early, 18th, century, around, 1712, captain, christopher, hussey, while, cruising, for, right, whales, near, shore, was, blown, offshore, by, a, northerly, wind, where, he, encountered, a, sperm, whale, pod, and, killed, one, although, the, story, may, not, be, true, sperm, whales, were, indeed, soon, exploited, by, american, whalers, judge, paul, dudley, in, his, essay, upon, the, natural, history, of, whales, 1725, states, that, a, certain, atkins, 10, or, 12, years, in, the, trade, was, among, the, first, to, catch, sperm, whales, sometime, around, 1720, off, the, new, england, coast, there, were, only, a, few, recorded, instances, during, the, first, few, decades, 1709, 1730s, of, offshore, sperm, whaling, instead, sloops, concentrated, on, the, nantucket, shoals, where, they, would, have, taken, right, whales, or, went, to, the, davis, strait, region, to, catch, bowhead, whales, by, the, early, 1740s, with, the, advent, of, spermaceti, candles, before, 1743, american, vessels, began, to, focus, on, sperm, whales, the, diary, of, benjamin, bangs, 1721, 1769, shows, that, along, with, the, bumpkin, sloop, he, sailed, he, found, three, other, sloops, flensing, sperm, whales, off, the, coast, of, north, carolina, in, late, may, 1743, on, returning, to, nantucket, in, the, summer, 1744, on, a, subsequent, voyage, he, noted, that, 45, spermacetes, are, brought, in, here, this, day, another, indication, that, american, sperm, whaling, was, in, full, swing, american, sperm, whaling, soon, spread, from, the, east, coast, of, the, american, colonies, to, the, gulf, stream, the, grand, banks, west, africa, 1763, the, azores, 1765, and, the, south, atlantic, 1770s, from, 1770, to, 1775, massachusetts, new, york, connecticut, and, rhode, island, ports, produced, 45, 000, barrels, of, sperm, oil, annually, compared, to, 8, 500, of, whale, oil, in, the, same, decade, the, british, began, sperm, whaling, employing, american, ships, and, personnel, by, the, following, decade, the, french, had, entered, the, trade, also, employing, american, expertise, sperm, whaling, increased, until, the, mid, nineteenth, century, spermaceti, oil, was, important, in, public, lighting, for, example, in, lighthouses, where, it, was, used, in, the, united, states, until, 1862, when, it, was, replaced, by, lard, oil, in, turn, replaced, by, petroleum, and, for, lubricating, the, machines, such, as, those, used, in, cotton, mills, of, the, industrial, revolution, sperm, whaling, declined, in, the, second, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, as, petroleum, came, into, broader, use, in, that, sense, petroleum, use, may, be, said, to, have, protected, whale, populations, from, even, greater, exploitation, sperm, whaling, in, the, 18th, century, began, with, small, sloops, carrying, only, one, or, two, whaleboats, the, fleet, s, scope, and, size, increased, over, time, and, larger, ships, entered, the, fishery, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, early, 19th, century, sperm, whaling, ships, sailed, to, the, equatorial, pacific, the, indian, ocean, japan, the, coast, of, arabia, australia, and, new, zealand, hunting, could, be, dangerous, to, the, crew, since, sperm, whales, especially, bulls, will, readily, fight, to, defend, themselves, against, attack, unlike, most, baleen, whales, when, dealing, with, a, threat, sperm, whales, will, use, their, huge, head, effectively, as, a, battering, ram, arguably, the, most, famous, sperm, whale, counter, attack, occurred, on, 20, november, 1820, when, a, whale, claimed, to, be, about, 25, 9, metres, 85, ft, long, rammed, and, sank, the, nantucket, whaleship, essex, only, 8, out, of, 21, sailors, survived, to, be, rescued, by, other, ships, the, sperm, whale, s, ivory, like, teeth, were, often, sought, by, 18th, and, 19th, century, whalers, who, used, them, to, produce, inked, carvings, known, as, scrimshaw, 30, teeth, of, the, sperm, whale, can, be, used, for, ivory, each, of, these, teeth, up, to, 20, cm, 8, in, and, 8, cm, 3, in, across, are, hollow, for, the, first, half, of, their, length, like, walrus, ivory, sperm, whale, ivory, has, two, distinct, layers, however, sperm, whale, ivory, contains, a, much, thicker, inner, layer, though, a, widely, practised, art, in, the, 19th, century, scrimshaw, using, genuine, sperm, whale, ivory, declined, substantially, after, the, retirement, of, the, whaling, fleets, in, the, 1880s, modern, whaling, was, more, efficient, than, open, boat, whaling, employing, steam, powered, ships, and, exploding, harpoons, initially, modern, whaling, activity, focused, on, large, baleen, whales, but, as, these, populations, were, taken, sperm, whaling, increased, spermaceti, the, fine, waxy, oil, produced, by, sperm, whales, was, in, high, demand, in, both, the, 1941, 1942, and, 1942, 1943, seasons, norwegian, expeditions, took, over, 3, 000, sperm, whales, off, the, coast, of, peru, alone, after, world, war, ii, whaling, continued, unabated, to, obtain, oil, for, cosmetics, and, high, performance, machinery, such, as, automobile, transmissions, the, hunting, led, to, the, near, extinction, of, large, whales, including, sperm, whales, until, bans, on, whale, oil, use, were, instituted, in, 1972, the, international, whaling, commission, gave, the, species, full, protection, in, 1985, but, hunting, by, japan, in, the, northern, pacific, ocean, continued, until, 1988, it, is, estimated, that, the, historic, worldwide, population, numbered, 1, 100, 000, before, commercial, sperm, whaling, began, in, the, early, 18th, century, by, 1880, it, had, declined, by, an, estimated, 29, percent, from, that, date, until, 1946, the, population, appears, to, have, partially, recovered, as, whaling, activity, decreased, but, after, the, second, world, war, the, population, declined, even, further, to, 33, per, cent, of, the, pre, whaling, population, between, 184, 000, and, 236, 000, sperm, whales, were, killed, by, the, various, whaling, nations, in, the, 19th, century, while, in, the, 20th, century, at, least, 770, 000, were, taken, the, majority, between, 1946, and, 1980, sperm, whales, increase, levels, of, primary, production, and, carbon, export, by, depositing, iron, rich, faeces, into, surface, waters, of, the, southern, ocean, the, iron, rich, faeces, cause, phytoplankton, to, grow, and, take, up, more, carbon, from, the, atmosphere, when, the, phytoplankton, dies, it, sinks, to, the, deep, ocean, and, takes, the, atmospheric, carbon, with, it, by, reducing, the, abundance, of, sperm, whales, in, the, southern, ocean, whaling, has, resulted, in, an, extra, 2, million, tonnes, of, carbon, remaining, in, the, atmosphere, each, year, remaining, sperm, whale, populations, are, large, enough, that, the, species, conservation, status, is, rated, as, vulnerable, rather, than, endangered, however, the, recovery, from, centuries, of, commercial, whaling, is, a, slow, process, particularly, in, the, south, pacific, where, the, toll, on, breeding, age, males, was, severe, the, total, number, of, sperm, whales, in, the, world, is, unknown, but, is, thought, to, be, in, the, hundreds, of, thousands, the, conservation, outlook, is, brighter, than, for, many, other, whales, commercial, whaling, has, ceased, and, the, species, is, protected, almost, worldwide, though, records, indicate, that, in, the, 11, year, period, starting, from, 2000, japanese, vessels, have, caught, 51, sperm, whales, fishermen, do, not, target, sperm, whales, to, eat, but, long, line, fishing, operations, in, the, gulf, of, alaska, have, complained, about, sperm, whales, stealing, fish, from, their, lines, currently, entanglement, in, fishing, nets, and, collisions, with, ships, represent, the, greatest,
