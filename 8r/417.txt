bombyx, mori, commonly, known, as, the, domestic, silk, moth, is, a, moth, species, belonging, to, the, family, bombycidae, it, is, the, closest, relative, of, bombyx, mandarina, the, wild, silk, moth, silkworms, are, the, larvae, of, silk, moths, the, silkworm, is, of, particular, economic, value, being, a, primary, producer, of, silk, the, silkworm, s, preferred, food, are, the, leaves, of, white, mulberry, though, they, may, eat, other, species, of, mulberry, and, even, leaves, of, other, plants, like, the, osage, orange, domestic, silk, moths, are, entirely, dependent, on, humans, for, reproduction, as, a, result, of, millennia, of, selective, breeding, wild, silk, moths, which, are, other, species, of, bombyx, are, not, as, commercially, viable, in, the, production, of, silk, sericulture, the, practice, of, breeding, silkworms, for, the, production, of, raw, silk, has, existed, for, at, least, 5, 000, years, in, china, whence, it, spread, to, india, korea, nepal, japan, and, then, the, west, the, conventional, process, of, sericulture, kills, the, silkworm, in, the, pupal, stage, the, domestic, silk, moth, was, domesticated, from, the, wild, silk, moth, bombyx, mandarina, which, has, a, range, from, northern, india, to, northern, china, korea, japan, and, the, far, eastern, regions, of, russia, the, domestic, silk, moth, derives, from, chinese, rather, than, japanese, or, korean, stock, silk, moths, were, unlikely, to, have, been, domestically, bred, before, the, neolithic, period, before, then, the, tools, to, manufacture, quantities, of, silk, thread, had, not, been, developed, the, domesticated, bombyx, mori, and, the, wild, bombyx, mandarina, can, still, breed, and, sometimes, produce, hybrids, 342, it, is, unknown, if, b, mori, can, hybridize, with, other, bombyx, species, compared, to, most, members, in, the, genus, bombyx, domestic, silk, moths, have, lost, their, coloration, as, well, as, their, ability, to, fly, mulberry, silkworms, can, be, divided, into, three, major, categories, based, on, seasonal, brood, frequency, univoltine, silkworms, produce, only, one, brood, a, season, and, they, are, generally, found, in, and, around, europe, univoltine, eggs, must, hibernate, through, the, winter, ultimately, cross, fertilizing, in, spring, bivoltine, varieties, are, normally, found, in, east, asia, and, their, accelerated, breeding, process, is, made, possible, by, slightly, warmer, climates, in, addition, there, are, polyvoltine, silkworms, found, only, in, the, tropics, their, eggs, typically, hatch, within, 9, to, 12, days, meaning, there, can, be, up, to, eight, generations, of, larvae, throughout, the, year, eggs, take, about, 14, days, to, hatch, into, larvae, which, eat, continuously, they, have, a, preference, for, white, mulberry, having, an, attraction, to, the, mulberry, odorant, cis, jasmone, they, are, not, monophagous, since, they, can, eat, other, species, of, morus, as, well, as, some, other, moraceae, mostly, osage, orange, they, are, covered, with, tiny, black, hairs, when, the, color, of, their, heads, turns, darker, it, indicates, they, are, about, to, molt, after, molting, the, larval, phase, of, the, silkworms, emerge, white, naked, and, with, little, horns, on, their, backs, after, they, have, molted, four, times, their, bodies, become, slightly, yellow, and, the, skin, becomes, tighter, the, larvae, then, prepare, to, enter, the, pupal, phase, of, their, life, cycle, and, enclose, themselves, in, a, cocoon, made, up, of, raw, silk, produced, by, the, salivary, glands, the, final, molt, from, larva, to, pupa, takes, place, within, the, cocoon, which, provides, a, layer, of, protection, during, the, vulnerable, almost, motionless, pupal, state, many, other, lepidoptera, produce, cocoons, but, only, a, few, the, bombycidae, in, particular, the, genus, bombyx, and, the, saturniidae, in, particular, the, genus, antheraea, have, been, exploited, for, fabric, production, the, cocoon, is, made, of, a, thread, of, raw, silk, from, 300, to, about, 900, metres, 980, to, about, 3, 000, ft, long, the, fibers, are, fine, and, lustrous, about, 10, m, 0, 0004, in, in, diameter, about, 2, 000, to, 3, 000, cocoons, are, required, to, make, one, pound, 0, 45, kg, at, least, 70, million, lb, 32, million, kg, of, raw, silk, are, produced, each, year, requiring, nearly, 10, billion, cocoons, if, the, animal, survives, through, the, pupal, phase, of, its, life, cycle, it, releases, proteolytic, enzymes, to, make, a, hole, in, the, cocoon, so, it, can, emerge, as, an, adult, moth, these, enzymes, are, destructive, to, the, silk, and, can, cause, the, silk, fibers, to, break, down, from, over, a, mile, in, length, to, segments, of, random, length, which, reduces, the, value, of, the, silk, threads, although, these, damaged, silk, cocoons, are, still, used, as, stuffing, available, in, china, and, elsewhere, in, the, production, of, duvets, jackets, and, other, purposes, to, prevent, this, silkworm, cocoons, are, boiled, in, water, the, heat, kills, the, silkworms, and, the, water, makes, the, cocoons, easier, to, unravel, often, the, silkworm, is, eaten, as, the, process, of, harvesting, the, silk, from, the, cocoon, kills, the, pupa, sericulture, has, been, criticized, by, animal, welfare, and, rights, activists, mahatma, gandhi, was, critical, of, silk, production, based, on, the, ahimsa, philosophy, not, to, hurt, any, living, thing, this, led, to, gandhi, s, promotion, of, cotton, spinning, machines, an, example, of, which, can, be, seen, at, the, gandhi, institute, and, an, extension, of, this, principle, has, led, to, the, modern, production, practice, known, as, ahimsa, silk, which, is, wild, silk, from, wild, and, semiwild, silk, moths, made, from, the, cocoons, of, moths, that, are, allowed, to, emerge, before, the, silk, is, harvested, the, moth, is, the, adult, phase, of, the, silk, worm, s, life, cycle, silk, moths, have, a, wingspan, of, 3, 5, cm, 1, 2, 2, 0, in, and, a, white, hairy, body, females, are, about, two, to, three, times, bulkier, than, males, due, to, carrying, many, eggs, all, adult, bombycidae, moths, have, reduced, mouthparts, and, do, not, feed, the, wings, of, the, silk, moth, develop, from, larval, imaginal, disks, the, moth, is, not, capable, of, functional, flight, in, contrast, to, the, wild, b, mandarina, and, other, bombyx, species, whose, males, fly, to, meet, females, some, may, emerge, with, the, ability, to, lift, off, and, stay, airborne, but, sustained, flight, cannot, be, achieved, as, their, bodies, are, too, big, and, heavy, for, their, small, wings, the, legs, of, the, silk, moth, develop, from, the, silkworm, s, larval, thoracic, legs, developmental, genes, like, distalless, and, extradenticle, have, been, used, to, mark, leg, development, in, addition, removing, specific, segments, of, the, thoracic, legs, at, different, ages, of, the, larva, resulted, in, the, adult, silk, moth, not, developing, the, corresponding, adult, leg, segments, due, to, its, small, size, and, ease, of, culture, the, silkworm, has, become, a, model, organism, in, the, study, of, lepidopteran, and, general, arthropod, biology, fundamental, findings, on, genetics, pheromones, hormones, brain, structures, and, physiology, have, been, made, with, the, silkworm, one, example, of, this, was, the, molecular, identification, of, the, first, known, pheromone, bombykol, which, required, extracts, from, 500, 000, individuals, due, to, the, small, quantities, of, pheromone, produced, by, any, individual, silkworm, many, research, works, have, focused, on, the, genetics, of, silkworms, and, the, possibility, of, genetic, engineering, many, hundreds, of, strains, are, maintained, and, over, 400, mendelian, mutations, have, been, described, another, source, suggests, 1, 000, inbred, domesticated, strains, are, kept, worldwide, one, useful, development, for, the, silk, industry, is, silkworms, that, can, feed, on, food, other, than, mulberry, leaves, including, an, artificial, diet, research, on, the, genome, also, raises, the, possibility, of, genetically, engineering, silkworms, to, produce, proteins, including, pharmacological, drugs, in, the, place, of, silk, proteins, bombyx, mori, females, are, also, one, of, the, few, organisms, with, homologous, chromosomes, held, together, only, by, the, synaptonemal, complex, and, not, crossovers, during, meiosis, in, the, oocytes, of, b, mori, meiosis, is, completely, achiasmate, lacking, crossovers, even, though, synaptonemal, complexes, are, formed, during, the, pachytene, stage, of, meiosis, in, b, mori, crossing, over, homologous, recombination, does, not, occur, between, the, paired, chromosomes, kraig, biocraft, laboratories, has, used, research, from, the, universities, of, wyoming, and, notre, dame, in, a, collaborative, effort, to, create, a, silkworm, that, is, genetically, altered, to, produce, spider, silk, in, september, 2010, the, effort, was, announced, as, successful, researchers, at, tufts, developed, scaffolds, made, of, spongy, silk, that, feel, and, look, similar, to, human, tissue, they, are, implanted, during, reconstructive, surgery, to, support, or, restructure, damaged, ligaments, tendons, and, other, tissue, they, also, created, implants, made, of, silk, and, drug, compounds, which, can, be, implanted, under, the, skin, for, steady, and, gradual, time, release, of, medications, researchers, at, the, mit, media, lab, experimented, with, silkworms, to, see, what, they, would, weave, when, left, on, surfaces, with, different, curvatures, they, found, that, on, particularly, straight, webs, of, lines, the, silkworms, would, connect, neighboring, lines, with, silk, weaving, directly, onto, the, given, shape, using, this, knowledge, they, built, a, silk, pavilion, with, 6, 500, silkworms, over, a, number, of, days, silkworms, have, been, used, in, antibiotic, discovery, as, they, have, several, advantageous, traits, compared, to, other, invertebrate, models, antibiotics, such, as, lysocin, e, a, non, ribosomal, peptide, synthesized, by, lysobacter, sp, rh2180, 5, and, gpi0363, are, among, the, notable, antibiotics, discovered, using, silkworms, in, addition, antibiotics, with, appropriate, pharmacokinetic, parameters, were, selected, that, correlated, with, therapeutic, activity, in, the, silkworm, infection, model, silkworms, have, also, been, used, for, the, identification, of, novel, virulence, factors, of, pathogenic, microorganisms, a, first, large, scale, screening, using, transposon, mutant, library, of, staphylococcus, aureus, usa300, strain, was, performed, which, identified, 8, new, genes, with, roles, in, full, virulence, of, s, aureus, another, study, by, the, same, team, of, researchers, revealed, for, the, first, time, the, role, of, yjbh, in, virulence, and, oxidative, stress, tolerance, in, vivo, the, domestic, species, b, mori, compared, to, the, wild, species, e, g, b, mandarina, has, increased, cocoon, size, body, size, growth, rate, and, efficiency, of, its, digestion, it, has, gained, tolerance, to, human, presence, and, handling, and, also, to, living, in, crowded, conditions, the, domestic, silk, moths, cannot, fly, so, the, males, need, human, assistance, in, finding, a, mate, and, it, lacks, fear, of, potential, predators, the, native, color, pigments, have, also, been, lost, so, the, domestic, silk, moths, are, leucistic, since, camouflage, is, not, useful, when, they, only, live, in, captivity, these, changes, have, made, b, mori, entirely, dependent, upon, humans, for, survival, and, it, does, not, exist, in, the, wild, the, eggs, are, kept, in, incubators, to, aid, in, their, hatching, silkworms, were, first, domesticated, in, china, more, than, 5, 000, years, ago, silkworm, breeding, is, aimed, at, the, overall, improvement, of, silkworms, from, a, commercial, point, of, view, the, major, objectives, are, improving, fecundity, the, health, of, larvae, quantity, of, cocoon, and, silk, production, and, disease, resistance, healthy, larvae, lead, to, a, healthy, cocoon, crop, health, is, dependent, on, factors, such, as, better, pupation, rate, fewer, dead, larvae, in, the, mountage, shorter, larval, duration, this, lessens, the, chance, of, infection, and, bluish, tinged, fifth, instar, larvae, which, are, healthier, than, the, reddish, brown, ones, quantity, of, cocoon, and, silk, produced, are, directly, related, to, the, pupation, rate, and, larval, weight, healthier, larvae, have, greater, pupation, rates, and, cocoon, weights, quality, of, cocoon, and, silk, depends, on, a, number, of, factors, including, genetics, in, the, u, s, teachers, may, sometimes, introduce, the, insect, life, cycle, to, their, students, by, raising, domestic, silk, moths, in, the, classroom, as, a, science, project, students, have, a, chance, to, observe, complete, life, cycles, of, insects, from, eggs, to, larvae, to, pupae, to, moths, the, domestic, silk, moth, has, been, raised, as, a, hobby, in, countries, such, as, china, south, africa, zimbabwe, and, iran, children, often, pass, on, the, eggs, to, the, next, generation, creating, a, non, commercial, population, the, experience, provides, children, with, the, opportunity, to, witness, the, life, cycle, of, silk, moths, the, full, genome, of, the, domestic, silk, moth, was, published, in, 2008, by, the, international, silkworm, genome, consortium, draft, sequences, were, published, in, 2004, the, genome, of, the, domestic, silk, moth, is, mid, range, with, a, genome, size, around, 432, million, base, pairs, a, notable, feature, is, that, 43, 6, of, the, genome, are, repetitive, sequences, most, of, which, are, transposable, elements, at, least, 3, 000, silkworm, genes, are, unique, and, have, no, homologous, equivalents, in, other, genomes, the, silkworm, s, ability, to, produce, large, amounts, of, silk, correlates, with, the, presence, of, specific, trna, clusters, as, well, as, some, clustered, sericin, genes, additionally, the, silkworm, s, ability, to, consume, toxic, mulberry, leaves, is, linked, to, specialized, sucrase, genes, which, appear, to, have, been, acquired, from, bacterial, genes, in, 2018, illumina, s, short, reads, for, 137, strain, genomes, were, published, in, 2022, nanopore, s, long, reads, for, 545, strain, genomes, were, published, silk, moth, pupae, are, edible, insects, and, are, eaten, in, some, cultures, silkworms, have, also, been, proposed, for, cultivation, by, astronauts, as, space, food, on, long, term, missions, in, china, a, legend, indicates, the, discovery, of, the, silkworm, s, silk, was, by, an, ancient, empress, named, leizu, the, wife, of, the, yellow, emperor, also, known, as, xi, lingshi, she, was, drinking, tea, under, a, tree, when, a, silk, cocoon, fell, into, her, tea, as, she, picked, it, out, and, started, to, wrap, the, silk, thread, around, her, finger, she, slowly, felt, a, warm, sensation, when, the, silk, ran, out, she, saw, a, small, larva, in, an, instant, she, realized, this, caterpillar, larva, was, the, source, of, the, silk, she, taught, this, to, the, people, and, it, became, widespread, many, more, legends, about, the, silkworm, are, told, the, chinese, guarded, their, knowledge, of, silk, but, according, to, one, story, a, chinese, princess, given, in, marriage, to, a, khotan, prince, brought, to, the, oasis, the, secret, of, silk, manufacture, hiding, silkworms, in, her, hair, as, part, of, her, dowry, probably, in, the, first, half, of, the, first, century, ad, about, ad, 550, christian, monks, are, said, to, have, smuggled, silkworms, hidden, in, a, hollow, stick, out, of, china, selling, the, secret, to, the, eastern, romans, according, to, a, vietnamese, folk, tale, silkworms, were, originally, a, beautiful, housemaid, running, away, from, her, gruesome, masters, and, living, in, the, mountain, where, she, was, protected, by, the, mountain, god, one, day, a, lecherous, god, from, the, heaven, came, down, to, earth, to, seduce, women, when, he, saw, her, he, tried, to, rape, her, but, she, was, able, to, escape, and, was, hidden, by, the, mountain, god, the, lecherous, god, then, tried, to, find, and, capture, her, by, setting, a, net, trap, around, the, mountain, with, the, blessing, of, guanyin, the, girl, was, able, to, safely, swallow, that, net, into, her, stomach, finally, the, evil, god, summons, his, fellow, thunder, and, rain, gods, to, attack, and, burn, away, her, clothes, forcing, her, to, hide, in, a, cave, naked, and, cold, she, spit, out, the, net, and, used, it, as, a, blanket, to, sleep, the, girl, died, in, her, sleep, and, as, she, wished, to, continue, to, help, other, people, her, soul, turned, into, silkworms, bombyx, mori, is, essentially, monophagous, exclusively, eating, mulberry, leaves, morus, spp, by, developing, techniques, for, using, artificial, diets, the, amino, acids, needed, for, development, are, known, the, various, amino, acids, can, be, classified, into, five, categories
