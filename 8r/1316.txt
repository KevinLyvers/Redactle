toxicology, is, a, scientific, discipline, overlapping, with, biology, chemistry, pharmacology, and, medicine, that, involves, the, study, of, the, adverse, effects, of, chemical, substances, on, living, organisms, and, the, practice, of, diagnosing, and, treating, exposures, to, toxins, and, toxicants, the, relationship, between, dose, and, its, effects, on, the, exposed, organism, is, of, high, significance, in, toxicology, factors, that, influence, chemical, toxicity, include, the, dosage, duration, of, exposure, whether, it, is, acute, or, chronic, route, of, exposure, species, age, sex, and, environment, toxicologists, are, experts, on, poisons, and, poisoning, there, is, a, movement, for, evidence, based, toxicology, as, part, of, the, larger, movement, towards, evidence, based, practices, toxicology, is, currently, contributing, to, the, field, of, cancer, research, since, some, toxins, can, be, used, as, drugs, for, killing, tumor, cells, one, prime, example, of, this, is, ribosome, inactivating, proteins, tested, in, the, treatment, of, leukemia, the, word, toxicology, t, k, s, k, l, d, i, is, a, neoclassical, compound, from, neo, latin, first, attested, c, 1799, from, the, combining, forms, toxico, logy, which, in, turn, come, from, the, ancient, greek, words, toxikos, poisonous, and, logos, subject, matter, dioscorides, a, greek, physician, in, the, court, of, the, roman, emperor, nero, made, the, first, attempt, to, classify, plants, according, to, their, toxic, and, therapeutic, effect, a, work, attributed, to, the, 10th, century, author, ibn, wahshiyya, called, the, book, on, poisons, describes, various, toxic, substances, and, poisonous, recipes, that, can, be, made, using, magic, a, 14th, century, kannada, poetic, work, attributed, to, the, jain, prince, mangarasa, khagendra, mani, darpana, describes, several, poisonous, plants, the, 16th, century, swiss, physician, paracelsus, is, considered, the, father, of, modern, toxicology, based, on, his, rigorous, for, the, time, approach, to, understanding, the, effects, of, substances, on, the, body, he, is, credited, with, the, classic, toxicology, maxim, alle, dinge, sind, gift, und, nichts, ist, ohne, gift, allein, die, dosis, macht, dass, ein, ding, kein, gift, ist, which, translates, as, all, things, are, poisonous, and, nothing, is, without, poison, only, the, dose, makes, a, thing, not, poisonous, this, is, often, condensed, to, the, dose, makes, the, poison, or, in, latin, sola, dosis, facit, venenum, 30, mathieu, orfila, is, also, considered, the, modern, father, of, toxicology, having, given, the, subject, its, first, formal, treatment, in, 1813, in, his, trait, des, poisons, also, called, toxicologie, g, n, rale, in, 1850, jean, stas, became, the, first, person, to, successfully, isolate, plant, poisons, from, human, tissue, this, allowed, him, to, identify, the, use, of, nicotine, as, a, poison, in, the, bocarm, murder, case, providing, the, evidence, needed, to, convict, the, belgian, count, hippolyte, visart, de, bocarm, of, killing, his, brother, in, law, the, goal, of, toxicity, assessment, is, to, identify, adverse, effects, of, a, substance, adverse, effects, depend, on, two, main, factors, i, routes, of, exposure, oral, inhalation, or, dermal, and, ii, dose, duration, and, concentration, of, exposure, to, explore, dose, substances, are, tested, in, both, acute, and, chronic, models, generally, different, sets, of, experiments, are, conducted, to, determine, whether, a, substance, causes, cancer, and, to, examine, other, forms, of, toxicity, factors, that, influence, chemical, toxicity, the, discipline, of, evidence, based, toxicology, strives, to, transparently, consistently, and, objectively, assess, available, scientific, evidence, in, order, to, answer, questions, in, toxicology, the, study, of, the, adverse, effects, of, chemical, physical, or, biological, agents, on, living, organisms, and, the, environment, including, the, prevention, and, amelioration, of, such, effects, evidence, based, toxicology, has, the, potential, to, address, concerns, in, the, toxicological, community, about, the, limitations, of, current, approaches, to, assessing, the, state, of, the, science, these, include, concerns, related, to, transparency, in, decision, making, synthesis, of, different, types, of, evidence, and, the, assessment, of, bias, and, credibility, evidence, based, toxicology, has, its, roots, in, the, larger, movement, towards, evidence, based, practices, toxicity, experiments, may, be, conducted, in, vivo, using, the, whole, animal, or, in, vitro, testing, on, isolated, cells, or, tissues, or, in, silico, in, a, computer, simulation, the, classic, experimental, tool, of, toxicology, is, testing, on, non, human, animals, examples, of, model, organisms, are, galleria, mellonella, which, can, replace, small, mammals, zebrafish, danio, rerio, which, allow, for, the, study, of, toxicology, in, a, lower, order, vertebrate, in, vivo, and, caenorhabditis, elegans, as, of, 2014, such, animal, testing, provides, information, that, is, not, available, by, other, means, about, how, substances, function, in, a, living, organism, the, use, of, non, human, animals, for, toxicology, testing, is, opposed, by, some, organisations, for, reasons, of, animal, welfare, and, it, has, been, restricted, or, banned, under, some, circumstances, in, certain, regions, such, as, the, testing, of, cosmetics, in, the, european, union, while, testing, in, animal, models, remains, as, a, method, of, estimating, human, effects, there, are, both, ethical, and, technical, concerns, with, animal, testing, since, the, late, 1950s, the, field, of, toxicology, has, sought, to, reduce, or, eliminate, animal, testing, under, the, rubric, of, three, rs, reduce, the, number, of, experiments, with, animals, to, the, minimum, necessary, refine, experiments, to, cause, less, suffering, and, replace, in, vivo, experiments, with, other, types, or, use, more, simple, forms, of, life, when, possible, the, historical, development, of, alternative, testing, methods, in, toxicology, has, been, published, by, balls, computer, modeling, is, an, example, of, an, alternative, in, vitro, toxicology, testing, method, using, computer, models, of, chemicals, and, proteins, structure, activity, relationships, can, be, determined, and, chemical, structures, that, are, likely, to, bind, to, and, interfere, with, proteins, with, essential, functions, can, be, identified, this, work, requires, expert, knowledge, in, molecular, modeling, and, statistics, together, with, expert, judgment, in, chemistry, biology, and, toxicology, in, 2007, the, american, ngo, national, academy, of, sciences, published, a, report, called, toxicity, testing, in, the, 21st, century, a, vision, and, a, strategy, which, opened, with, a, statement, change, often, involves, a, pivotal, event, that, builds, on, previous, history, and, opens, the, door, to, a, new, era, pivotal, events, in, science, include, the, discovery, of, penicillin, the, elucidation, of, the, dna, double, helix, and, the, development, of, computers, toxicity, testing, is, approaching, such, a, scientific, pivot, point, it, is, poised, to, take, advantage, of, the, revolutions, in, biology, and, biotechnology, advances, in, toxicogenomics, bioinformatics, systems, biology, epigenetics, and, computational, toxicology, could, transform, toxicity, testing, from, a, system, based, on, whole, animal, testing, to, one, founded, primarily, on, in, vitro, methods, that, evaluate, changes, in, biologic, processes, using, cells, cell, lines, or, cellular, components, preferably, of, human, origin, as, of, 2014, that, vision, was, still, unrealized, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, studied, 1, 065, chemical, and, drug, substances, in, their, toxcast, program, part, of, the, comptox, chemicals, dashboard, using, in, silica, modelling, and, a, human, pluripotent, stem, cell, based, assay, to, predict, in, vivo, developmental, intoxicants, based, on, changes, in, cellular, metabolism, following, chemical, exposure, major, findings, from, the, analysis, of, this, toxcast, stm, dataset, published, in, 2020, include, 1, 19, of, 1065, chemicals, yielded, a, prediction, of, developmental, toxicity, 2, assay, performance, reached, 79, 82, accuracy, with, high, specificity, 84, but, modest, sensitivity, 67, when, compared, with, in, vivo, animal, models, of, human, prenatal, developmental, toxicity, 3, sensitivity, improved, as, more, stringent, weights, of, evidence, requirements, were, applied, to, the, animal, studies, and, 4, statistical, analysis, of, the, most, potent, chemical, hits, on, specific, biochemical, targets, in, toxcast, revealed, positive, and, negative, associations, with, the, stm, response, providing, insights, into, the, mechanistic, underpinnings, of, the, targeted, endpoint, and, its, biological, domain, in, some, cases, shifts, away, from, animal, studies, have, been, mandated, by, law, or, regulation, the, european, union, eu, prohibited, use, of, animal, testing, for, cosmetics, in, 2013, most, chemicals, display, a, classic, dose, response, curve, at, a, low, dose, below, a, threshold, no, effect, is, observed, 80, some, show, a, phenomenon, known, as, sufficient, challenge, a, small, exposure, produces, animals, that, grow, more, rapidly, have, better, general, appearance, and, coat, quality, have, fewer, tumors, and, live, longer, than, the, control, animals, a, few, chemicals, have, no, well, defined, safe, level, of, exposure, these, are, treated, with, special, care, some, chemicals, are, subject, to, bioaccumulation, as, they, are, stored, in, rather, than, being, excreted, from, the, body, 85, 90, these, also, receive, special, consideration, several, measures, are, commonly, used, to, describe, toxic, dosages, according, to, the, degree, of, effect, on, an, organism, or, a, population, and, some, are, specifically, defined, by, various, laws, or, organizational, usage, these, include, medical, toxicology, is, the, discipline, that, requires, physician, status, md, or, do, degree, plus, specialty, education, and, experience, clinical, toxicology, is, the, discipline, that, can, be, practiced, not, only, by, physicians, but, also, other, health, professionals, with, a, master, s, degree, in, clinical, toxicology, physician, extenders, physician, assistants, nurse, practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and, allied, health, professionals, forensic, toxicology, is, the, discipline, that, makes, use, of, toxicology, and, other, disciplines, such, as, analytical, chemistry, pharmacology, and, clinical, chemistry, to, aid, medical, or, legal, investigation, of, death, poisoning, and, drug, use, the, primary, concern, for, forensic, toxicology, is, not, the, legal, outcome, of, the, toxicological, investigation, or, the, technology, utilized, but, rather, the, obtainment, and, interpretation, of, results, computational, toxicology, is, a, discipline, that, develops, mathematical, and, computer, based, models, to, better, understand, and, predict, adverse, health, effects, caused, by, chemicals, such, as, environmental, pollutants, and, pharmaceuticals, within, the, toxicology, in, the, 21st, century, project, the, best, predictive, models, were, identified, to, be, deep, neural, networks, random, forest, and, support, vector, machines, which, can, reach, the, performance, of, in, vitro, experiments, occupational, toxicology, is, the, application, of, toxicology, to, chemical, hazards, in, the, workplace, a, toxicologist, is, a, scientist, or, medical, personnel, who, specializes, in, the, study, of, symptoms, mechanisms, treatments, and, detection, of, venoms, and, toxins, especially, the, poisoning, of, people, to, work, as, a, toxicologist, one, should, obtain, a, degree, in, toxicology, or, a, related, degree, like, biology, chemistry, pharmacology, or, biochemistry, bachelor, s, degree, programs, in, toxicology, cover, the, chemical, makeup, of, toxins, and, their, effects, on, biochemistry, physiology, and, ecology, after, introductory, life, science, courses, are, complete, students, typically, enroll, in, labs, and, apply, toxicology, principles, to, research, and, other, studies, advanced, students, delve, into, specific, sectors, like, the, pharmaceutical, industry, or, law, enforcement, which, apply, methods, of, toxicology, in, their, work, the, society, of, toxicology, sot, recommends, that, undergraduates, in, postsecondary, schools, that, do, not, offer, a, bachelor, s, degree, in, toxicology, consider, attaining, a, degree, in, biology, or, chemistry, additionally, the, sot, advises, aspiring, toxicologists, to, take, statistics, and, mathematics, courses, as, well, as, gain, laboratory, experience, through, lab, courses, student, research, projects, and, internships, to, become, medical, toxicologists, physicians, in, the, united, states, complete, residency, training, such, as, in, emergency, medicine, pediatrics, or, internal, medicine, followed, by, fellowship, in, medical, toxicology, and, eventual, certification, by, the, american, college, of, medical, toxicology, acmt, toxicologists, perform, many, different, duties, including, research, in, the, academic, nonprofit, and, industrial, fields, product, safety, evaluation, consulting, public, service, and, legal, regulation, in, order, to, research, and, assess, the, effects, of, chemicals, toxicologists, perform, carefully, designed, studies, and, experiments, these, experiments, help, identify, the, specific, amount, of, a, chemical, that, may, cause, harm, and, potential, risks, of, being, near, or, using, products, that, contain, certain, chemicals, research, projects, may, range, from, assessing, the, effects, of, toxic, pollutants, on, the, environment, to, evaluating, how, the, human, immune, system, responds, to, chemical, compounds, within, pharmaceutical, drugs, while, the, basic, duties, of, toxicologists, are, to, determine, the, effects, of, chemicals, on, organisms, and, their, surroundings, specific, job, duties, may, vary, based, on, industry, and, employment, for, example, forensic, toxicologists, may, look, for, toxic, substances, in, a, crime, scene, whereas, aquatic, toxicologists, may, analyze, the, toxicity, level, of, water, bodies, the, salary, for, jobs, in, toxicology, is, dependent, on, several, factors, including, level, of, schooling, specialization, experience, the, u, s, bureau, of, labor, statistics, bls, notes, that, jobs, for, biological, scientists, which, generally, include, toxicologists, were, expected, to, increase, by, 21, between, 2008, and, 2018, the, bls, notes, that, this, increase, could, be, due, to, research, and, development, growth, in, biotechnology, as, well, as, budget, increases, for, basic, and, medical, research, in, biological, science
