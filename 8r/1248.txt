addiction, is, a, neuropsychological, disorder, characterized, by, a, persistent, and, intense, urge, to, use, a, drug, or, engage, in, a, behavior, that, produces, natural, reward, despite, substantial, harm, and, other, negative, consequences, repetitive, drug, use, often, alters, brain, function, in, ways, that, perpetuate, craving, and, weakens, but, does, not, completely, negate, self, control, this, phenomenon, drugs, reshaping, brain, function, has, led, to, an, understanding, of, addiction, as, a, brain, disorder, with, a, complex, variety, of, psychosocial, as, well, as, neurobiological, and, thus, involuntary, factors, that, are, implicated, in, addiction, s, development, classic, signs, of, addiction, include, compulsive, engagement, in, rewarding, stimuli, preoccupation, with, substances, or, behavior, and, continued, use, despite, negative, consequences, habits, and, patterns, associated, with, addiction, are, typically, characterized, by, immediate, gratification, short, term, reward, coupled, with, delayed, deleterious, effects, long, term, costs, examples, of, substance, addiction, include, alcoholism, cannabis, addiction, amphetamine, addiction, cocaine, addiction, nicotine, addiction, opioid, addiction, and, eating, or, food, addiction, behavioral, addictions, may, include, gambling, addiction, shopping, addiction, stalking, internet, addiction, social, media, addiction, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, video, game, addiction, and, sexual, addiction, the, dsm, 5, and, icd, 10, only, recognize, gambling, addictions, as, behavioral, addictions, but, the, icd, 11, also, recognizes, gaming, addictions, addiction, and, addictive, behaviour, are, polysemes, denoting, a, category, of, mental, disorders, of, neuropsychological, symptoms, or, of, merely, maladaptive, harmful, habits, and, lifestyles, a, common, use, of, addiction, in, medicine, is, for, neuropsychological, symptoms, denoting, pervasive, excessive, and, intense, urges, to, engage, in, a, category, of, behavioral, compulsions, or, impulses, towards, sensory, rewards, e, g, alcohol, betel, quid, drugs, sex, gambling, video, gaming, addictive, disorders, or, addiction, disorders, are, mental, disorders, involving, high, intensities, of, addictions, as, neuropsychological, symptoms, that, induce, functional, disabilities, i, e, limit, subjects, social, family, and, occupational, activities, the, two, categories, of, such, disorders, are, substance, use, addictions, and, behavioral, addictions, volkow, et, al, 2016, report, that, the, dsm, 5, defines, addictions, as, the, most, severe, degree, of, the, addictive, disorders, due, to, pervasive, excessive, substance, use, or, behavioural, compulsions, impulses, it, is, a, definition, that, many, scientific, papers, and, reports, use, dependence, is, also, a, polyseme, denoting, either, neuropsychological, symptoms, or, mental, disorders, in, the, dsm, 5, dependences, differ, from, addictions, and, can, even, normally, happen, without, addictions, besides, substance, use, dependences, are, severe, stages, of, substance, use, addictions, i, e, mental, disorders, involving, withdrawal, issues, in, the, icd, 11, substance, use, dependence, is, a, synonym, of, substance, use, addiction, i, e, neuropsychological, symptoms, that, can, but, do, not, necessarily, involve, withdrawal, issues, drug, addiction, which, belongs, to, the, class, of, substance, related, disorders, is, a, chronic, and, relapsing, brain, disorder, that, features, drug, seeking, and, drug, abuse, despite, their, harmful, effects, this, form, of, addiction, changes, brain, circuitry, such, that, the, brain, s, reward, system, is, compromised, causing, functional, consequences, for, stress, management, and, self, control, damage, to, the, functions, of, the, organs, involved, can, persist, throughout, a, lifetime, and, cause, death, if, untreated, substances, involved, with, drug, addiction, include, alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, opioids, cocaine, amphetamines, and, even, foods, with, high, fat, and, sugar, content, addictions, can, begin, experimentally, in, social, contexts, and, can, arise, from, the, use, of, prescribed, medications, or, a, variety, of, other, measures, drug, addiction, has, been, shown, to, work, in, phenomenological, conditioning, operant, and, classical, cognitive, models, and, the, cue, reactivity, model, however, no, one, model, completely, illustrates, substance, abuse, risk, factors, for, addiction, include, the, diagnostic, criteria, for, food, or, eating, addiction, has, not, been, categorized, or, defined, in, references, such, as, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, or, dsm, 5, and, is, based, on, subjective, experiences, similar, to, substance, use, disorders, food, addiction, may, be, found, in, those, with, eating, disorders, though, not, all, people, with, eating, disorders, have, food, addiction, and, not, all, of, those, with, food, addiction, have, a, diagnosed, eating, disorder, long, term, frequent, and, excessive, consumption, of, foods, high, in, fat, salt, or, sugar, such, as, chocolate, can, produce, an, addiction, similar, to, drugs, since, they, trigger, the, brain, s, reward, system, such, that, the, individual, may, desire, the, same, foods, to, an, increasing, degree, over, time, the, signals, sent, when, consuming, highly, palatable, foods, have, the, ability, to, counteract, the, body, s, signals, for, fullness, and, persistent, cravings, will, result, those, who, show, signs, of, food, addiction, may, develop, food, tolerances, in, which, they, eat, more, despite, the, food, becoming, less, satisfactory, chocolate, s, sweet, flavor, and, pharmacological, ingredients, are, known, to, create, a, strong, craving, or, feel, addictive, by, the, consumer, a, person, who, has, a, strong, liking, for, chocolate, may, refer, to, themselves, as, a, chocoholic, risk, factors, for, developing, food, addiction, include, excessive, overeating, and, impulsivity, the, yale, food, addiction, scale, yfas, version, 2, 0, is, the, current, standard, measure, for, assessing, whether, an, individual, exhibits, signs, and, symptoms, of, food, addiction, it, was, developed, in, 2009, at, yale, university, on, the, hypothesis, that, foods, high, in, fat, sugar, and, salt, have, addictive, like, effects, which, contribute, to, problematic, eating, habits, the, yfas, is, designed, to, address, 11, substance, related, and, addictive, disorders, srads, using, a, 25, item, self, report, questionnaire, based, on, the, diagnostic, criteria, for, srads, as, per, dsm, 5, a, potential, food, addiction, diagnosis, is, predicted, by, the, presence, of, at, least, two, out, of, 11, srads, and, a, significant, impairment, to, daily, activities, the, barratt, impulsiveness, scale, specifically, the, bis, 11, scale, and, the, upps, p, impulsive, behavior, subscales, of, negative, urgency, and, lack, of, perseverance, have, been, shown, to, have, relation, to, food, addiction, the, term, behavioral, addiction, refers, to, a, compulsion, to, engage, in, a, natural, reward, which, is, a, behavior, that, is, inherently, rewarding, i, e, desirable, or, appealing, despite, adverse, consequences, preclinical, evidence, has, demonstrated, that, marked, increases, in, the, expression, of, fosb, through, repetitive, and, excessive, exposure, to, a, natural, reward, induces, the, same, behavioral, effects, and, neuroplasticity, as, occurs, in, a, drug, addiction, addiction, can, exist, in, the, absence, of, psychotropic, drugs, which, was, popularized, by, peele, these, are, termed, behavioral, addictions, such, addictions, may, be, passive, or, active, but, they, commonly, contain, reinforcing, features, which, are, found, in, most, addictions, sexual, behavior, eating, gambling, playing, video, games, and, shopping, are, all, associated, with, compulsive, behaviors, in, humans, and, have, been, shown, to, activate, the, mesolimbic, pathway, and, other, parts, of, the, reward, system, based, on, this, evidence, sexual, addiction, gambling, addiction, video, game, addiction, and, shopping, addiction, are, classified, accordingly, sexual, addiction, involves, an, engagement, in, excessive, compulsive, or, otherwise, problematic, sexual, behavior, that, persists, despite, negative, physiological, psychological, social, and, occupational, consequences, sexual, addiction, may, be, referred, to, as, hypersexuality, or, compulsive, sexual, behavior, disorder, the, dsm, 5, does, not, recognize, sexual, addiction, as, a, clinical, diagnosis, hypersexuality, disorder, and, internet, addiction, disorder, were, among, proposed, addictions, to, the, dsm, 5, but, were, later, rejected, due, to, the, insufficient, evidence, available, in, support, of, the, existence, of, these, disorders, as, discrete, mental, health, conditions, reviews, of, both, clinical, research, in, humans, and, preclinical, studies, involving, fosb, have, identified, compulsive, sexual, activity, specifically, any, form, of, sexual, intercourse, as, an, addiction, i, e, sexual, addiction, reward, cross, sensitization, between, amphetamine, and, sexual, activity, meaning, that, exposure, to, one, increases, the, desire, for, both, has, been, shown, to, occur, as, a, dopamine, dysregulation, syndrome, fosb, expression, is, required, for, this, cross, sensitization, effect, which, intensifies, with, the, level, of, fosb, expression, gambling, provides, a, natural, reward, that, is, associated, with, compulsive, behavior, functional, neuroimaging, evidence, shows, that, gambling, activates, the, reward, system, and, the, mesolimbic, pathway, in, particular, it, is, known, that, dopamine, is, involved, in, learning, motivation, as, well, as, the, reward, system, the, exact, role, of, dopamine, in, gambling, addiction, has, been, debated, suggested, roles, for, d2, d3, and, d4, dopamine, receptors, as, well, as, d3, receptors, in, the, substantia, nigra, have, been, found, in, rat, and, human, models, showing, a, correlation, with, the, severity, of, the, gambling, behavior, this, in, turn, was, linked, with, greater, dopamine, release, in, the, dorsal, striatum, gambling, addictions, are, linked, with, comorbidities, such, as, mental, health, disorders, substance, abuse, alcohol, use, disorder, and, personality, disorders, risk, factors, for, gambling, addictions, include, antisocial, behavior, impulsive, personality, male, sex, sensation, seeking, substance, use, and, young, age, gambling, addiction, has, been, associated, with, some, personality, traits, including, harm, avoidance, low, self, direction, decision, making, and, planning, insufficiencies, impulsivity, as, well, as, sensation, seeking, individuals, although, some, personality, traits, can, be, linked, with, gambling, addiction, there, is, no, general, description, of, individuals, addicted, to, gambling, internet, addiction, does, not, have, any, standardized, definition, yet, there, is, widespread, agreement, that, this, problem, exists, debate, over, the, classification, of, problematic, internet, use, considers, whether, it, should, be, thought, of, as, a, behavioral, addiction, an, impulse, control, disorder, or, an, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, others, argue, that, internet, addiction, should, be, considered, a, symptom, of, an, underlying, mental, health, condition, and, not, a, disorder, in, itself, internet, addiction, has, been, described, as, a, psychological, dependence, on, the, internet, regardless, of, the, type, of, activity, once, logged, on, problematic, internet, use, may, include, a, preoccupation, with, the, internet, and, or, digital, media, excessive, time, spent, using, the, internet, despite, resultant, distress, in, the, individual, increase, in, the, amount, of, internet, use, required, to, achieve, the, same, desired, emotional, response, loss, of, control, over, one, s, internet, use, habits, withdrawal, symptoms, and, continued, problematic, internet, use, despite, negative, consequences, to, one, s, work, social, academic, or, personal, life, studies, conducted, in, india, united, states, asia, and, europe, have, identified, internet, addiction, prevalence, rates, ranging, in, value, from, 1, to, 19, with, the, adolescent, population, having, high, rates, compared, to, other, age, groups, prevalence, rates, have, been, difficult, to, establish, due, to, a, lack, of, universally, accepted, diagnostic, criteria, a, lack, of, diagnostic, instruments, demonstrating, cross, cultural, validity, and, reliability, and, existing, controversy, surrounding, the, validity, of, labeling, problematic, internet, use, as, an, addictive, disorder, the, most, common, scale, used, to, measure, addiction, is, the, internet, addiction, test, developed, by, kimberly, young, people, with, internet, addiction, are, likely, to, have, a, comorbid, psychiatric, disorder, comorbid, diagnoses, identified, alongside, internet, addiction, include, affective, mood, disorders, anxiety, disorders, substance, use, disorders, and, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, video, game, addiction, is, characterized, by, the, world, health, organization, who, as, excessive, gaming, behavior, potentially, prioritized, over, other, interests, despite, the, negative, consequences, that, may, arise, for, a, period, of, at, least, 12, months, in, may, 2019, the, who, introduced, gaming, disorder, in, the, 11th, edition, of, the, international, classification, of, diseases, video, game, addiction, has, been, shown, to, be, more, prevalent, in, males, than, females, higher, by, 2, 9, times, it, has, been, suggested, that, people, of, younger, ages, are, more, prone, to, become, addicted, to, video, games, people, with, certain, personalities, may, be, more, susceptible, to, gaming, addictions, risk, factors, for, video, game, addiction, include, shopping, addiction, or, compulsive, buying, disorder, cbd, is, the, excessive, urge, to, shop, or, spend, potentially, resulting, in, unwanted, consequences, these, consequences, can, have, serious, impacts, such, as, increased, consumer, debt, negatively, affected, relationships, increased, risk, of, illegal, behavior, and, suicide, attempts, shopping, addiction, occurs, worldwide, and, has, shown, a, 5, 8, prevalence, in, the, united, states, similar, to, other, behavioral, addictions, cbd, can, be, linked, to, mood, disorders, substance, use, disorders, eating, disorders, and, other, disorders, involving, a, lack, of, control, signs, and, symptoms, of, addiction, can, vary, depending, on, the, type, of, addiction, symptoms, of, drug, addictions, may, include, signs, and, symptoms, of,

s, behavior, in, an, addiction, in, operant, conditioning, behavior, is, influenced, by, outside, stimulus, such, as, a, drug, the, operant, conditioning, theory, of, learning, is, useful, in, understanding, why, the, mood, altering, or, stimulating, consequences, of, drug, use, can, reinforce, continued, use, an, example, of, positive, reinforcement, and, why, the, addicted, person, seeks, to, avoid, withdrawal, through, continued, use, an, example, of, negative, reinforcement, stimulus, control, is, using, the, absence, of, the, stimulus, or, presence, of, a, reward, to, influence, the, resulting, behavior, cognitive, control, is, the, intentional, selection, of, thoughts, behaviors, and, emotions, based, on, our, environment, it, has, been, shown, that, drugs, alter, the, way, our, brains, function, and, its, structure, cognitive, functions, such, as, learning, memory, and, impulse, control, are, affected, by, drugs, these, effects, promote, drug, use, as, well, as, hinder, the, ability, to, abstain, from, it, the, increase, in, dopamine, release, is, prominent, in, drug, use, specifically, in, the, ventral, striatum, and, the, nucleus, accumbens, dopamine, is, responsible, for, producing, pleasurable, feelings, as, well, driving, us, to, perform, important, life, activities, addictive, drugs, cause, a, significant, increase, in, this, reward, system, causing, a, large, increase, in, dopamine, signaling, as, well, as, increase, in, reward, seeking, behavior, in, turn, motivating, drug, use, this, promotes, the, development, of, a, maladaptive, drug, to, stimulus, relationship, early, drug, use, leads, to, these, maladaptive, associations, later, affecting, cognitive, processes, used, for, coping, which, are, needed, to, successfully, abstain, from, them, a, number, of, genetic, and, environmental, risk, factors, exist, for, developing, an, addiction, genetic, and, environmental, risk, factors, each, account, for, roughly, half, of, an, individual, s, risk, for, developing, an, addiction, the, contribution, from, epigenetic, risk, factors, to, the, total, risk, is, unknown, even, in, individuals, with, a, relatively, low, genetic, risk, exposure, to, sufficiently, high, doses, of, an, addictive, drug, for, a, long, period, of, time, e, g, weeks, months, can, result, in, an, addiction, adverse, childhood, events, are, associated, with, negative, health, outcomes, such, as, substance, use, disorder, childhood, abuse, or, exposure, to, violent, crime, is, related, to, developing, a, mood, or, anxiety, disorder, as, well, as, a, substance, dependence, risk, genetic, factors, along, with, socio, environmental, e, g, psychosocial, factors, have, been, established, as, significant, contributors, to, addiction, vulnerability, studies, done, on, 350, hospitalized, drug, dependent, patients, showed, that, over, half, met, the, criteria, for, alcohol, abuse, with, a, role, of, familial, factors, being, prevalent, genetic, factors, account, for, 40, 60, of, the, risk, factors, for, alcoholism, similar, rates, of, heritability, for, other, types, of, drug, addiction, have, been, indicated, specifically, in, genes, that, encode, the, alpha5, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptor, knestler, hypothesized, in, 1964, that, a, gene, or, group, of, genes, might, contribute, to, predisposition, to, addiction, in, several, ways, for, example, altered, levels, of, a, normal, protein, due, to, environmental, factors, may, change, the, structure, or, functioning, of, specific, brain, neurons, during, development, these, altered, brain, neurons, could, affect, the, susceptibility, of, an, individual, to, an, initial, drug, use, experience, in, support, of, this, hypothesis, animal, studies, have, shown, that, environmental, factors, such, as, stress, can, affect, an, animal, s, genetic, expression, in, humans, twin, studies, into, addiction, have, provided, some, of, the, highest, quality, evidence, of, this, link, with, results, finding, that, if, one, twin, is, affected, by, addiction, the, other, twin, is, likely, to, be, as, well, and, to, the, same, substance, further, evidence, of, a, genetic, component, is, research, findings, from, family, studies, which, suggest, that, if, one, family, member, has, a, history, of, addiction, the, chances, of, a, relative, or, close, family, developing, those, same, habits, are, much, higher, than, one, who, has, not, been, introduced, to, addiction, at, a, young, age, the, data, implicating, specific, genes, in, the, development, of, drug, addiction, is, mixed, for, most, genes, many, addiction, studies, that, aim, to, identify, specific, genes, focus, on, common, variants, with, an, allele, frequency, of, greater, than, 5, in, the, general, population, when, associated, with, disease, these, only, confer, a, small, amount, of, additional, risk, with, an, odds, ratio, of, 1, 1, 1, 3, percent, this, has, led, to, the, development, the, rare, variant, hypothesis, which, states, that, genes, with, low, frequencies, in, the, population, 1, confer, much, greater, additional, risk, in, the, development, of, the, disease, genome, wide, association, studies, gwas, are, used, to, examine, genetic, associations, with, dependence, addiction, and, drug, use, these, studies, rarely, identify, genes, from, proteins, previously, described, via, animal, knockout, models, and, candidate, gene, analysis, instead, large, percentages, of, genes, involved, in, processes, such, as, cell, adhesion, are, commonly, identified, the, important, effects, of, endophenotypes, are, typically, not, capable, of, being, captured, by, these, methods, genes, identified, in, gwas, for, drug, addiction, may, be, involved, either, in, adjusting, brain, behavior, before, drug, experiences, subsequent, to, them, or, both, environmental, risk, factors, for, addiction, are, the, experiences, of, an, individual, during, their, lifetime, that, interact, with, the, individual, s, genetic, composition, to, increase, or, decrease, his, or, her, vulnerability, to, addiction, for, example, after, the, nationwide, outbreak, of, covid, 19, more, people, quit, vs, started, smoking, and, smokers, on, average, reduced, the, quantity, of, cigarettes, they, consumed, more, generally, a, number, of, different, environmental, factors, have, been, implicated, as, risk, factors, for, addiction, including, various, psychosocial, stressors, the, national, institute, on, drug, abuse, nida, and, studies, cite, lack, of, parental, supervision, the, prevalence, of, peer, substance, use, substance, availability, and, poverty, as, risk, factors, for, substance, use, among, children, and, adolescents, the, brain, disease, model, of, addiction, posits, that, an, individual, s, exposure, to, an, addictive, drug, is, the, most, significant, environmental, risk, factor, for, addiction, many, researchers, including, neuroscientists, indicate, that, the, brain, disease, model, presents, a, misleading, incomplete, and, potentially, detrimental, explanation, of, addiction, the, psychoanalytic, theory, model, defines, addiction, as, a, form, of, defense, against, feelings, of, hopelessness, and, helplessness, as, well, as, a, symptom, of, failure, to, regulate, powerful, emotions, related, to, adverse, childhood, experiences, aces, various, forms, of, maltreatment, and, dysfunction, experienced, in, childhood, in, this, case, the, addictive, substance, provides, brief, but, total, relief, and, positive, feelings, of, control, the, adverse, childhood, experiences, study, by, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, has, shown, a, strong, dose, response, relationship, between, aces, and, numerous, health, social, and, behavioral, problems, throughout, a, person, s, lifespan, including, substance, use, disorder, children, s, neurological, development, can, be, permanently, disrupted, when, they, are, chronically, exposed, to, stressful, events, such, as, physical, emotional, or, sexual, abuse, physical, or, emotional, neglect, witnessing, violence, in, the, household, or, a, parent, being, incarcerated, or, having, a, mental, illness, as, a, result, the, child, s, cognitive, functioning, or, ability, to, cope, with, negative, or, disruptive, emotions, may, be, impaired, over, time, the, child, may, adopt, substance, use, as, a, coping, mechanism, or, as, a, result, of, reduced, impulse, control, particularly, during, adolescence, vast, amounts, of, children, who, experienced, abuse, have, gone, on, to, have, some, form, of, addiction, in, their, adolescence, or, adult, life, this, pathway, towards, addiction, that, is, opened, through, stressful, experiences, during, childhood, can, be, avoided, by, a, change, in, environmental, factors, throughout, an, individual, s, life, and, opportunities, of, professional, help, if, one, has, friends, or, peers, who, engage, in, drug, use, favorably, the, chances, of, them, developing, an, addiction, increases, family, conflict, and, home, management, is, a, cause, for, one, to, become, engaged, in, drug, use, according, to, travis, hirschi, s, social, control, theory, adolescents, with, stronger, attachments, to, family, religious, academic, and, other, social, institutions, are, less, likely, to, engage, in, delinquent, and, maladaptive, behavior, such, as, drug, use, leading, to, addiction, adolescence, represents, a, period, of, increased, vulnerability, for, developing, an, addiction, in, adolescence, the, incentive, rewards, systems, in, the, brain, mature, well, before, the, cognitive, control, center, this, consequentially, grants, the, incentive, rewards, systems, a, disproportionate, amount, of, power, in, the, behavioral, decision, making, process, therefore, adolescents, are, increasingly, likely, to, act, on, their, impulses, and, engage, in, risky, potentially, addicting, behavior, before, considering, the, consequences, not, only, are, adolescents, more, likely, to, initiate, and, maintain, drug, use, but, once, addicted, they, are, more, resistant, to, treatment, and, more, liable, to, relapse, most, individuals, are, exposed, to, and, use, addictive, drugs, for, the, first, time, during, their, teenage, years, in, the, united, states, there, were, just, over, 2, 8, million, new, users, of, illicit, drugs, in, 2013, 7, 800, new, users, per, day, among, them, 54, 1, were, under, 18, years, of, age, in, 2011, there, were, approximately, 20, 6, million, people, in, the, united, states, over, the, age, of, 12, with, an, addiction, over, 90, of, those, with, an, addiction, began, drinking, smoking, or, using, illicit,

as, a, risk, for, the, development, of, substance, addictions, it, has, been, found, that, emotional, stressors, as, well, as, social, adversities, may, lead, to, an, initial, epigenetic, response, which, causes, an, alteration, to, the, reward, signalling, pathways, this, change, may, predispose, one, to, experience, a, positive, response, to, drug, use, epigenetic, genes, and, their, products, e, g, proteins, are, the, key, components, through, which, environmental, influences, can, affect, the, genes, of, an, individual, they, serve, as, the, mechanism, responsible, for, transgenerational, epigenetic, inheritance, a, phenomenon, in, which, environmental, influences, on, the, genes, of, a, parent, can, affect, the, associated, traits, and, behavioral, phenotypes, of, their, offspring, e, g, behavioral, responses, to, environmental, stimuli, in, addiction, epigenetic, mechanisms, play, a, central, role, in, the, pathophysiology, of, the, disease, it, has, been, noted, that, some, of, the, alterations, to, the, epigenome, which, arise, through, chronic, exposure, to, addictive, stimuli, during, an, addiction, can, be, transmitted, across, generations, in, turn, affecting, the, behavior, of, one, s, children, e, g, the, child, s, behavioral, responses, to, addictive, drugs, and, natural, rewards, the, general, classes, of, epigenetic, alterations, that, have, been, implicated, in, transgenerational, epigenetic, inheritance, include, dna, methylation, histone, modifications, and, downregulation, or, upregulation, of, micrornas, with, respect, to, addiction, more, research, is, needed, to, determine, the, specific, heritable, epigenetic, alterations, that, arise, from, various, forms, of, addiction, in, humans, and, the, corresponding, behavioral, phenotypes, from, these, epigenetic, alterations, that, occur, in, human, offspring, based, on, preclinical, evidence, from, animal, research, certain, addiction, induced, epigenetic, alterations, in, rats, can, be, transmitted, from, parent, to, offspring, and, produce, behavioral, phenotypes, that, decrease, the, offspring, s, risk, of, developing, an, addiction, more, generally, the, heritable, behavioral, phenotypes, that, are, derived, from, addiction, induced, epigenetic, alterations, and, transmitted, from, parent, to, offspring, may, serve, to, either, increase, or, decrease, the, offspring, s, risk, of, developing, an, addiction, addiction, is, a, disorder, of, the, brain, s, reward, system, developing, through, transcriptional, and, epigenetic, mechanisms, as, a, result, of, chronically, high, levels, of, exposure, to, an, addictive, stimulus, e, g, eating, food, the, use, of, cocaine, engagement, in, sexual, activity, participation, in, high, thrill, cultural, activities, such, as, gambling, etc, over, extended, time, deltafosb, fosb, a, gene, transcription, factor, is, a, critical, component, and, common, factor, in, the, development, of, virtually, all, forms, of, behavioral, and, drug, addictions, two, decades, of, research, into, fosb, s, role, in, addiction, have, demonstrated, that, addiction, arises, and, the, associated, compulsive, behavior, intensifies, or, attenuates, along, with, the, overexpression, of, fosb, in, the, d1, type, medium, spiny, neurons, of, the, nucleus, accumbens, due, to, the, causal, relationship, between, fosb, expression, and, addictions, it, is, used, preclinically, as, an, addiction, biomarker, fosb, expression, in, these, neurons, directly, and, positively, regulates, drug, self, administration, and, reward, sensitization, through, positive, reinforcement, while, decreasing, sensitivity, to, aversion, chronic, addictive, drug, use, causes, alterations, in, gene, expression, in, the, mesocorticolimbic, projection, the, most, important, transcription, factors, that, produce, these, alterations, are, fosb, camp, response, element, binding, protein, creb, and, nuclear, factor, kappa, b, nf, b, fosb, is, the, most, significant, biomolecular, mechanism, in, addiction, because, the, overexpression, of, fosb, in, the, d1, type, medium, spiny, neurons, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, is, necessary, and, sufficient, for, many, of, the, neural, adaptations, and, behavioral, effects, e, g, expression, dependent, increases, in, drug, self, administration, and, reward, sensitization, seen, in, drug, addiction, fosb, expression, in, nucleus, accumbens, d1, type, medium, spiny, neurons, directly, and, positively, regulates, drug, self, administration, and, reward, sensitization, through, positive, reinforcement, while, decreasing, sensitivity, to, aversion, fosb, has, been, implicated, in, mediating, addictions, to, many, different, drugs, and, drug, classes, including, alcohol, amphetamine, and, other, substituted, amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methylphenidate, nicotine, opiates, phenylcyclidine, and, propofol, among, others, jund, a, transcription, factor, and, g9a, a, histone, methyltransferase, both, oppose, the, function, of, fosb, and, inhibit, increases, in, its, expression, increases, in, nucleus, accumbens, jund, expression, via, viral, vector, mediated, gene, transfer, or, g9a, expression, via, pharmacological, means, reduces, or, with, a, large, increase, can, even, block, many, of, the, neural, and, behavioral, alterations, that, result, from, chronic, high, dose, use, of, addictive, drugs, i, e, the, alterations, mediated, by, fosb, fosb, plays, an, important, role, in, regulating, behavioral, responses, to, natural, rewards, such, as, palatable, food, sex, and, exercise, natural, rewards, like, drugs, of, abuse, induce, gene, expression, of, fosb, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, and, chronic, acquisition, of, these, rewards, can, result, in, a, similar, pathological, addictive, state, through, fosb, overexpression, consequently, fosb, is, the, key, transcription, factor, involved, in, addictions, to, natural, rewards, i, e, behavioral, addictions, as, well, in, particular, fosb, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, is, critical, for, the, reinforcing, effects, of, sexual, reward, research, on, the, interaction, between, natural, and, drug, rewards, suggests, that, dopaminergic, psychostimulants, e, g, amphetamine, and, sexual, behavior, act, on, similar, biomolecular, mechanisms, to, induce, fosb, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, and, possess, bidirectional, cross, sensitization, effects, that, are, mediated, through, fosb, this, phenomenon, is, notable, since, in, humans, a, dopamine, dysregulation, syndrome, characterized, by, drug, induced, compulsive, engagement, in, natural, rewards, specifically, sexual, activity, shopping, and, gambling, has, been, observed, in, some, individuals, taking, dopaminergic, medications, fosb, inhibitors, drugs, or, treatments, that, oppose, its, action, may, be, an, effective, treatment, for, addiction, and, addictive, disorders, the, release, of, dopamine, in, the, nucleus,

the, biological, basis, of, drug, addiction, the, reward, pathway, known, as, the, mesolimbic, pathway, or, its, extension, the, mesocorticolimbic, pathway, is, characterized, by, the, interaction, of, several, areas, of, the, brain, other, brain, structures, that, are, involved, in, addiction, include, dopamine, is, the, primary, neurotransmitter, of, the, reward, system, in, the, brain, it, plays, a, role, in, regulating, movement, emotion, cognition, motivation, and, feelings, of, pleasure, natural, rewards, like, eating, as, well, as, recreational, drug, use, cause, a, release, of, dopamine, and, are, associated, with, the, reinforcing, nature, of, these, stimuli, nearly, all, addictive, drugs, directly, or, indirectly, act, on, the, brain, s, reward, system, by, heightening, dopaminergic, activity, excessive, intake, of, many, types, of, addictive, drugs, results, in, repeated, release, of, high, amounts, of, dopamine, which, in, turn, affects, the, reward, pathway, directly, through, heightened, dopamine, receptor, activation, prolonged, and, abnormally, high, levels, of, dopamine, in, the, synaptic, cleft, can, induce, receptor, downregulation, in, the, neural, pathway, downregulation, of, mesolimbic, dopamine, receptors, can, result, in, a, decrease, in, the, sensitivity, to, natural, reinforcers, drug, seeking, behavior, is, induced, by, glutamatergic, projections, from, the, prefrontal, cortex, to, the, nucleus, accumbens, this, idea, is, supported, with, data, from, experiments, showing, that, drug, seeking, behavior, can, be, prevented,

usually, involves, the, use, of, nicotine, replacement, therapy, nicotinic, receptor, antagonists, and, or, nicotinic, receptor, partial, agonists, examples, of, drugs, that, act, on, nicotinic, receptors, and, have, been, used, for, treating, nicotine, addiction, include, antagonists, like, bupropion, and, the, partial, agonist, varenicline, cytisine, a, partial, agonist, is, an, effective,

using, replacement, drugs, such, as, buprenorphine, the, active, ingredient, in, products, such, as, suboxone, and, subutex, and, methadone, although, these, drugs, perpetuate, physical, dependence, the, goal, of, opiate, maintenance, is, to, provide, a, measure, of, control, over, both, pain, and, cravings, use, of, replacement, drugs, increases, the, addicted, individual, s, ability, to,

cocaine, and, methamphetamine, the, study, shows, that, the, vaccine, may, save, lives, during, a, drug, overdose, in, this, instance, the, idea, is, that, the, body, will, respond, to, the, vaccine, by, quickly, producing, antibodies, to, prevent, the, opioids, from, accessing, the, brain, since, addiction, involves, abnormalities, in, glutamate, and, gabaergic, neurotransmission, receptors,

challenges, and, can, be, an, effective, way, to, address, addiction, in, this, population, a, study, conducted, in, 2009, in, the, republic, of, moldova, looked, into, the, social, dynamics, of, initiating, injection, drug, usage, by, examining, 42, audio, recorded, semi, structured, interviews, with, present, and, former, injectors, a, thematic, analysis, suggested, that, self, injection, was, viewed, as, a, symbolic, transition, of, identity, enabled, by, interpersonal, interactions, and, collective, influences, personal, narratives, of, self, transition, were, connected, to, larger, narratives, of, social, transitions, the, personal, narratives, of, self, initiation, and, transition, are, contextualized, and, understood, in, terms, of, political, social, narratives, within, the, core, concept, of, the, transitional, society, another, study, examined, the, narratives, of, initiators, people, who, help, people, who, inject, drugs, pwid, with, their, first, injection, through, their, accounts, respondents, described, initiation, events, as, meaningful, transitions, to, a, life, characterized, by, predictable, downfalls, of, homelessness, infections, and, social, stigma, initiators, used, examples, from, their, own, personal, experience, to, explain, the, process, of, initiation, and, assistance, attributing, personal, agency, and, predicting, specific, injection, related, harms, for, initiates, they, distinguished, between, two, forms, of, harm, potentially, avoidable, proximal, harm, caused, by, risky, injection, practices, e, g, overdose, hiv, and, perceived, inevitable, distal, harm, caused, by, long, term, injection, e, g, socioeconomic, decline, in, this, way, these, narratives, reflect, a, balance, of, individual, agency, harm, reduction, intentions, and, accepted, notions, of, life, after, initiation, interact, with, the, narrative, experiences, and, intentions, of, pwids, from, a, philosophy, perspective, the, behavior, of, many, with, addiction, that, is, not, explained, by, executive, dysfunction, or, biological, reasons, can, be, explained, by, folk, psychology, specifically, the, belief, desire, model, according, to, this, model, a, person, acquires, and, uses, a, substance, or, does, an, addictive, activity, in, belief, that, it, will, help, them, achieve, a, goal, while, regarded, biomedically, as, a, neuropsychological, disorder, addiction, is, multi, layered, with, biological, psychological, social, cultural, and, spiritual, biopsychosocial, cultural, spiritual, elements, a, biopsychosocial, cultural, spiritual, approach, fosters, the, crossing, of, disciplinary, boundaries, and, promotes, holistic, considerations, of, addiction, a, biopsychosocial, cultural, spiritual, approach, considers, for, example, how, physical, environments, influence, experiences, habits, and, patterns, of, addiction, ethnographic, engagements, and, developments, in, fields, of, knowledge, have, contributed, to, biopsychosocial, cultural, spiritual, understandings, of, addiction, including, the, work, of, philippe, bourgois, whose, fieldwork, with, street, level, drug, dealers, in, east, harlem, highlights, correlations, between, drug, use, and, structural, oppression, in, the, united, states, prior, models, that, have, informed, the, prevailing, biopsychosocial, cultural, spiritual, consideration, of, addiction, include, the, cultural, model, an, anthropological, understanding, of, the, emergence, of, drug, use, and, abuse, was, developed, by, dwight, heath, heath, undertook, ethnographic, research, and, fieldwork, with, the, camba, people, of, bolivia, from, june, 1956, to, august, 1957, heath, observed, that, adult, members, of, society, drank, large, quantities, of, rum, and, became, intoxicated, for, several, contiguous, days, at, least, twice, a, month, this, frequent, heavy, drinking, from, which, intoxication, followed, was, typically, undertaken, socially, during, festivals, having, returned, in, 1989, heath, observed, that, while, much, had, changed, drinking, parties, remained, as, per, his, initial, observations, and, there, appear, to, be, no, harmful, consequences, to, anyone, heath, s, observations, and, interactions, reflected, that, this, form, of, social, behavior, the, habitual, heavy, consumption, of, alcohol, was, encouraged, and, valued, enforcing, social, bonds, in, the, camba, community, despite, frequent, intoxication, even, to, the, point, of, unconsciousness, the, camba, held, no, concept, of, alcoholism, a, form, of, addiction, and, no, visible, social, problems, associated, with, drunkenness, or, addiction, were, apparent, as, noted, by, merrill, singer, heath, s, findings, when, considered, alongside, subsequent, cross, cultural, experiences, challenged, the, perception, that, intoxication, is, socially, inherently, disruptive, following, this, fieldwork, heath, proposed, the, cultural, model, suggesting, that, problems, associated, with, heavy, drinking, such, as, alcoholism, a, recognised, form, addiction, were, cultural, that, is, that, alcoholism, is, determined, by, cultural, beliefs, and, therefore, varies, among, cultures, heath, s, findings, challenged, the, notion, that, continued, use, is, inexorably, addictive, and, damaging, to, the, consumer, s, health, the, cultural, model, did, face, criticism, by, sociologist, robin, room, and, others, who, felt, anthropologists, could, downgrade, the, severity, of, the, problem, merrill, singer, found, it, notable, that, the, ethnographers, working, within, the, prominence, of, the, cultural, model, were, part, of, the, wet, generation, while, not, blind, to, the, disruptive, dysfunctional, and, debilitating, effects, of, alcohol, consumption, they, were, products, socialized, to, view, alcohol, consumption, as, normal, historically, addiction, has, been, viewed, from, the, etic, perspective, defining, users, through, the, pathology, of, their, condition, as, reports, of, drug, use, rapidly, increased, the, cultural, model, found, application, in, anthropological, research, exploring, western, drug, subculture, practices, the, approach, evolved, from, the, ethnographic, exploration, into, the, lived, experiences, and, subjectivities, of, 1960s, and, 1970s, drug, subcultures, the, seminal, publication, taking, care, of, business, by, edward, preble, and, john, j, casey, documented, the, daily, lives, of, new, york, street, based, intravenous, heroin, users, in, rich, detail, providing, unique, insight, into, the, dynamic, social, worlds, and, activities, that, surrounded, their, drug, use, these, findings, challenge, popular, narratives, of, immorality, and, deviance, conceptualizing, substance, abuse, as, a, social, phenomenon, the, prevailing, culture, can, have, a, greater, influence, on, drug, taking, behaviors, than, the, physical, and, psychological, effects, of, the, drug, itself, to, marginalized, individuals, drug, subcultures, can, provide, social, connection, symbolic, meaning, and, socially, constructed, purpose, that, they, may, feel, is, unattainable, through, conventional, means, the, subcultural, model, demonstrates, the, complexities, of, addiction, highlighting, the, need, for, an, integrated, approach, it, contends, that, a, biosocial, approach, is, required, to, achieve, a, holistic, understanding, of, addiction, emerging, in, the, early, 1980s, the, critical, medical, anthropology, model, was, introduced, and, as, merrill, singer, offers, was, applied, quickly, to, the, analysis, of, drug, use, where, the, cultural, model, of, the, 1950s, looked, at, the, social, body, the, critical, medical, anthropology, model, revealed, the, body, politic, considering, drug, use, and, addiction, within, the, context, of, macro, level, structures, including, larger, political, systems, economic, inequalities, and, the, institutional, power, held, over, social, processes, highly, relevant, to, addiction, the, three, issues, emphasized, in, the, model, are, these, three, key, points, highlight, how, drugs, may, come, to, be, used, to, self, medicate, the, psychological, trauma, of, socio, political, disparity, and, injustice, intertwining, with, licit, and, illicit, drug, market, politics, social, suffering, the, misery, among, those, on, the, weaker, end, of, power, relations, in, terms, of, physical, health, mental, health, and, lived, experience, is, used, by, anthropologists, to, analyze, how, individuals, may, have, personal, problems, caused, by, political, and, economic, power, from, the, perspective, of, critical, medical, anthropology, heavy, drug, use, and, addiction, is, a, consequence, of, such, larger, scale, unequal, distributions, of, power, the, three, models, developed, here, the, cultural, model, the, subcultural, model, and, the, critical, medical, anthropology, model, display, how, addiction, is, not, an, experience, to, be, considered, only, biomedically, through, consideration, of, addiction, alongside, the, biological, psychological, social, cultural, and, spiritual, biopsychosocial, spiritual, elements, which, influence, its, experience, a, holistic, and, comprehensive, understanding, can, be, built, albert, bandura, s, 1977, social, learning, theory, posits, that, individuals, acquire, addictive, behaviors, by, observing, and, imitating, models, in, their, social, environment, the, likelihood, of, engaging, in, and, sustaining, similar, addictive, behaviors, is, influenced, by, the, reinforcement, and, punishment, observed, in, others, the, principle, of, reciprocal, determinism, suggests, that, the, functional, relationships, between, personal, environmental, and, behavioral, factors, act, as, determinants, of, addictive, behavior, thus, effective, treatment, targets, each, dynamic, facet, of, the, biopsychosocial, disorder, the, transtheoretical, model, of, change, suggests, that, overcoming, an, addiction, is, a, stepwise, process, that, occurs, through, several, stages, precontemplation, this, initial, stage, precedes, individuals, considering, a, change, in, their, behavior, they, might, be, oblivious, to, or, in, denial, of, their, addiction, failing, to, recognize, the, need, for, change, contemplation, is, the, stage, in, which, individuals, become, aware, of, the, problems, caused, by, their, addiction, and, are, considering, change, although, they, may, not, fully, commit, they, weigh, the, costs, and, benefits, of, making, a, shift, preparation, individuals, in, this, stage, are, getting, ready, to, change, they, might, have, taken, preliminary, steps, like, gathering, information, or, making, small, commitments, in, preparation, for, behavioral, change, action, involves, actively, modifying, behavior, by, making, specific, observable, changes, to, address, the, addictive, behavior, the, action, stage, requires, significant, effort, and, commitment, maintenance, after, successfully, implementing, a, change, individuals, enter, the, maintenance, stage, where, they, work, to, sustain, the, new, behavior, and, prevent, relapse, this, stage, is, characterized, by, ongoing, effort, and, consolidation, of, gains, termination, relapse, prevention, recognizing, that, relapse, is, a, common, part, of, the, change, process, this, stage, focuses, on, identifying, and, addressing, factors, that, may, lead, to, a, return, to, old, behaviors, relapse, is, viewed, as, an, opportunity, for, learning, and, strategy, adjustment, with, the, ultimate, goal, of, eliminating, or, terminating, the, targeted, behavior, the, transtheoretical, model, can, be, helpful, in, guiding, development, of, tailored, behavioral, interventions, that, can, promote, lasting, change, progression, through, these, stages, may, not, always, follow, a, linear, path, as, individuals, may, move, back, and, forth, between, stages, resistance, to, change, is, recognized, as, an, expected, part, of, the, process, addiction, causes, an, astoundingly, high, financial, and, human, toll, on, individuals, and, society, as, a, whole, in, the, united, states, the, total, economic, cost, to, society, is, greater, than, that, of, all, types, of, diabetes, and, all, cancers, combined, these, costs, arise, from, the, direct, adverse, effects, of, drugs, and, associated, healthcare, costs, e, g, emergency, medical, services, and, outpatient, and, inpatient, care, long, term, complications, e, g, lung, cancer, from, smoking, tobacco, products, liver, cirrhosis, and, dementia, from, chronic, alcohol, consumption, and, meth, mouth, from, methamphetamine, use, the, loss, of, productivity, and, associated, welfare,
