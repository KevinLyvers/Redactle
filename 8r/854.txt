adapiformes, lemuriformes, see, text, sister, haplorhini, strepsirrhini, or, strepsirhini, s, t, r, p, s, r, a, n, i, strep, s, ry, nee, is, a, suborder, of, primates, that, includes, the, lemuriform, primates, which, consist, of, the, lemurs, of, madagascar, galagos, bushbabies, and, pottos, from, africa, and, the, lorises, from, india, and, southeast, asia, collectively, they, are, referred, to, as, strepsirrhines, also, belonging, to, the, suborder, are, the, extinct, adapiform, primates, which, thrived, during, the, eocene, in, europe, north, america, and, asia, but, disappeared, from, most, of, the, northern, hemisphere, as, the, climate, cooled, adapiforms, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, being, lemur, like, although, the, diversity, of, both, lemurs, and, adapiforms, does, not, support, this, comparison, strepsirrhines, are, defined, by, their, wet, moist, rhinarium, the, tip, of, the, snout, hence, the, colloquial, but, inaccurate, term, wet, nosed, similar, to, the, rhinaria, of, canines, and, felines, they, also, have, a, smaller, brain, than, comparably, sized, simians, large, olfactory, lobes, for, smell, a, vomeronasal, organ, to, detect, pheromones, and, a, bicornuate, uterus, with, an, epitheliochorial, placenta, their, eyes, contain, a, reflective, layer, to, improve, their, night, vision, and, their, eye, sockets, include, a, ring, of, bone, around, the, eye, but, they, lack, a, wall, of, thin, bone, behind, it, strepsirrhine, primates, produce, their, own, vitamin, c, whereas, haplorhine, primates, must, obtain, it, from, their, diets, lemuriform, primates, are, characterized, by, a, toothcomb, a, specialized, set, of, teeth, in, the, front, lower, part, of, the, mouth, mostly, used, for, combing, fur, during, grooming, many, of, today, s, living, strepsirrhines, are, endangered, due, to, habitat, destruction, hunting, for, bushmeat, and, live, capture, for, the, exotic, pet, trade, both, living, and, extinct, strepsirrhines, are, behaviorally, diverse, although, all, are, primarily, arboreal, tree, dwelling, most, living, lemuriforms, are, nocturnal, while, most, adapiforms, were, diurnal, both, living, and, extinct, groups, primarily, fed, on, fruit, leaves, and, insects, the, taxonomic, name, strepsirrhini, derives, from, the, greek, strepsis, a, turning, round, and, rhis, nose, snout, in, pl, nostrils, gen, rhinos, which, refers, to, the, appearance, of, the, sinuous, comma, shaped, nostrils, on, the, rhinarium, or, wet, nose, the, name, was, first, used, by, french, naturalist, tienne, geoffroy, saint, hilaire, in, 1812, as, a, subordinal, rank, comparable, to, platyrrhini, new, world, monkeys, and, catarrhini, old, world, monkeys, in, his, description, he, mentioned, les, narines, terminales, et, sinueuses, nostrils, terminal, and, winding, when, british, zoologist, reginald, innes, pocock, revived, strepsirrhini, and, defined, haplorhini, in, 1918, he, omitted, the, second, r, from, both, strepsi, r, hini, and, haplo, r, hini, instead, of, strepsi, rr, hini, and, haplo, rr, hini, although, he, did, not, remove, the, second, r, from, platyrrhini, or, catarrhini, both, of, which, were, also, named, by, geoffroy, in, 1812, following, pocock, many, researchers, continued, to, spell, strepsirrhini, with, a, single, r, until, primatologists, paulina, jenkins, and, prue, napier, pointed, out, the, error, in, 1987, strepsirrhines, include, the, extinct, adapiforms, and, the, lemuriform, primates, which, include, lemurs, and, lorisoids, lorises, pottos, and, galagos, strepsirrhines, diverged, from, the, haplorhine, primates, near, the, beginning, of, the, primate, radiation, between, 55, and, 90, mya, older, divergence, dates, are, based, on, genetic, analysis, estimates, while, younger, dates, are, based, on, the, scarce, fossil, record, lemuriform, primates, may, have, evolved, from, either, cercamoniines, or, sivaladapids, both, of, which, were, adapiforms, that, may, have, originated, in, asia, they, were, once, thought, to, have, evolved, from, adapids, a, more, specialized, and, younger, branch, of, adapiform, primarily, from, europe, scandentia, treeshrews, dermoptera, colugos, plesiadapiformes, simians, tarsiers, omomyiformes, adapiformes, lorisoids, lemurs, lemurs, rafted, from, africa, to, madagascar, between, 47, and, 54, mya, whereas, the, lorises, split, from, the, african, galagos, around, 40, mya, and, later, colonized, asia, the, lemuriforms, and, particularly, the, lemurs, of, madagascar, are, often, portrayed, inappropriately, as, living, fossils, or, as, examples, of, basal, or, inferior, primates, these, views, have, historically, hindered, the, understanding, of, mammalian, evolution, and, the, evolution, of, strepsirrhine, traits, such, as, their, reliance, on, smell, olfaction, characteristics, of, their, skeletal, anatomy, and, their, brain, size, which, is, relatively, small, in, the, case, of, lemurs, natural, selection, has, driven, this, isolated, population, of, primates, to, diversify, significantly, and, fill, a, rich, variety, of, ecological, niches, despite, their, smaller, and, less, complex, brains, compared, to, simians, the, divergence, between, strepsirrhines, simians, and, tarsiers, likely, followed, almost, immediately, after, primates, first, evolved, although, few, fossils, of, living, primate, groups, lemuriforms, tarsiers, and, simians, are, known, from, the, early, to, middle, eocene, evidence, from, genetics, and, recent, fossil, finds, both, suggest, they, may, have, been, present, during, the, early, adaptive, radiation, the, origin, of, the, earliest, primates, that, the, simians, and, tarsiers, both, evolved, from, is, a, mystery, both, their, place, of, origin, and, the, group, from, which, they, emerged, are, uncertain, although, the, fossil, record, demonstrating, their, initial, radiation, across, the, northern, hemisphere, is, very, detailed, the, fossil, record, from, the, tropics, where, primates, most, likely, first, developed, is, very, sparse, particularly, around, the, time, that, primates, and, other, major, clades, of, eutherian, mammals, first, appeared, lacking, detailed, tropical, fossils, geneticists, and, primatologists, have, used, genetic, analyses, to, determine, the, relatedness, between, primate, lineages, and, the, amount, of, time, since, they, diverged, using, this, molecular, clock, divergence, dates, for, the, major, primate, lineages, have, suggested, that, primates, evolved, more, than, 80, 90, mya, nearly, 40, million, years, before, the, first, examples, appear, in, the, fossil, record, the, early, primates, include, both, nocturnal, and, diurnal, small, bodied, species, and, all, were, arboreal, with, hands, and, feet, specially, adapted, for, maneuvering, on, small, branches, plesiadapiforms, from, the, early, paleocene, are, sometimes, considered, archaic, primates, because, their, teeth, resembled, those, of, early, primates, and, because, they, possessed, adaptations, to, living, in, trees, such, as, a, divergent, big, toe, hallux, although, plesiadapiforms, were, closely, related, to, primates, they, may, represent, a, paraphyletic, group, from, which, primates, may, or, may, not, have, directly, evolved, and, some, genera, may, have, been, more, closely, related, to, colugos, which, are, thought, to, be, more, closely, related, to, primates, the, first, true, primates, euprimates, do, not, appear, in, the, fossil, record, until, the, early, eocene, 55, mya, at, which, point, they, radiated, across, the, northern, hemisphere, during, a, brief, period, of, rapid, global, warming, known, as, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, these, first, primates, included, cantius, donrussellia, altanius, and, teilhardina, on, the, northern, continents, as, well, as, the, more, questionable, and, fragmentary, fossil, altiatlasius, from, paleocene, africa, these, earliest, fossil, primates, are, often, divided, into, two, groups, adapiforms, and, omomyiforms, both, appeared, suddenly, in, the, fossil, record, without, transitional, forms, to, indicate, ancestry, and, both, groups, were, rich, in, diversity, and, were, widespread, throughout, the, eocene, the, last, branch, to, develop, were, the, adapiforms, a, diverse, and, widespread, group, that, thrived, during, the, eocene, 56, to, 34, million, years, ago, in, europe, north, america, and, asia, they, disappeared, from, most, of, the, northern, hemisphere, as, the, climate, cooled, the, last, of, the, adapiforms, died, out, at, the, end, of, the, miocene, 7, mya, adapiform, primates, are, extinct, strepsirrhines, that, shared, many, anatomical, similarities, with, lemurs, they, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, lemur, like, primates, although, the, diversity, of, both, lemurs, and, adapiforms, do, not, support, this, analogy, like, the, living, strepsirrhines, adapiforms, were, extremely, diverse, with, at, least, 30, genera, and, 80, species, known, from, the, fossil, record, as, of, the, early, 2000s, they, diversified, across, laurasia, during, the, eocene, some, reaching, north, america, via, a, land, bridge, they, were, among, the, most, common, mammals, found, in, the, fossil, beds, from, that, time, a, few, rare, species, have, also, been, found, in, northern, africa, the, most, basal, of, the, adapiforms, include, the, genera, cantius, from, north, america, and, europe, and, donrussellia, from, europe, the, latter, bears, the, most, ancestral, traits, so, it, is, often, considered, a, sister, group, or, stem, group, of, the, other, adapiforms, adapiforms, are, often, divided, into, three, major, groups, the, relationship, between, adapiform, and, lemuriform, primates, has, not, been, clearly, demonstrated, so, the, position, of, adapiforms, as, a, paraphyletic, stem, group, is, questionable, both, molecular, clock, data, and, new, fossil, finds, suggest, that, the, lemuriform, divergence, from, the, other, primates, and, the, subsequent, lemur, lorisoid, split, both, predate, the, appearance, of, adapiforms, in, the, early, eocene, new, calibration, methods, may, reconcile, the, discrepancies, between, the, molecular, clock, and, the, fossil, record, favoring, more, recent, divergence, dates, the, fossil, record, suggests, that, the, strepsirrhine, adapiforms, and, the, haplorhine, omomyiforms, had, been, evolving, independently, before, the, early, eocene, although, their, most, basal, members, share, enough, dental, similarities, to, suggest, that, they, diverged, during, the, paleocene, 66, 55, mya, lemuriform, origins, are, unclear, and, debated, american, paleontologist, philip, gingerich, proposed, that, lemuriform, primates, evolved, from, one, of, several, genera, of, european, adapids, based, on, similarities, between, the, front, lower, teeth, of, adapids, and, the, toothcomb, of, extant, lemuriforms, however, this, view, is, not, strongly, supported, due, to, a, lack, of, clear, transitional, fossils, instead, lemuriforms, may, be, descended, from, a, very, early, branch, of, asian, cercamoniines, or, sivaladapids, that, migrated, to, northern, africa, until, discoveries, of, three, 40, million, year, old, fossil, lorisoids, karanisia, saharagalago, and, wadilemur, in, the, el, fayum, deposits, of, egypt, between, 1997, and, 2005, the, oldest, known, lemuriforms, had, come, from, the, early, miocene, 20, mya, of, kenya, and, uganda, these, newer, finds, demonstrate, that, lemuriform, primates, were, present, during, the, middle, eocene, in, afro, arabia, and, that, the, lemuriform, lineage, and, all, other, strepsirrhine, taxa, had, diverged, before, then, djebelemur, from, tunisia, dates, to, the, late, early, or, early, middle, eocene, 52, to, 46, mya, and, has, been, considered, a, cercamoniine, but, also, may, have, been, a, stem, lemuriform, azibiids, from, algeria, date, to, roughly, the, same, time, and, may, be, a, sister, group, of, the, djebelemurids, together, with, plesiopithecus, from, the, late, eocene, egypt, the, three, may, qualify, as, the, stem, lemuriforms, from, africa, molecular, clock, estimates, indicate, that, lemurs, and, the, lorisoids, diverged, in, africa, during, the, paleocene, approximately, 62, mya, between, 47, and, 54, mya, lemurs, dispersed, to, madagascar, by, rafting, in, isolation, the, lemurs, diversified, and, filled, the, niches, often, filled, by, monkeys, and, apes, today, in, africa, the, lorises, and, galagos, diverged, during, the, eocene, approximately, 40, mya, unlike, the, lemurs, in, madagascar, they, have, had, to, compete, with, monkeys, and, apes, as, well, as, other, mammals, the, taxonomy, of, strepsirrhines, is, controversial, and, has, a, complicated, history, confused, taxonomic, terminology, and, oversimplified, anatomical, comparisons, have, created, misconceptions, about, primate, and, strepsirrhine, phylogeny, illustrated, by, the, media, attention, surrounding, the, single, ida, fossil, in, 2009, strepsirrhine, primates, were, first, grouped, under, the, genus, lemur, by, swedish, taxonomist, carl, linnaeus, in, the, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, published, in, 1758, at, the, time, only, three, species, were, recognized, one, of, which, the, colugo, is, no, longer, recognized, as, a, primate, in, 1785, dutch, naturalist, pieter, boddaert, divided, the, genus, lemur, into, two, genera, prosimia, for, the, lemurs, colugos, and, tarsiers, and, tardigradus, for, the, lorises, ten, years, later, geoffroy, and, georges, cuvier, grouped, the, tarsiers, and, galagos, due, to, similarities, in, their, hindlimb, morphology, a, view, supported, by, german, zoologist, johann, karl, wilhelm, illiger, who, placed, them, in, the, family, macrotarsi, while, placing, the, lemurs, and, tarsiers, in, the, family, prosimia, prosimii, in, 1811, the, use, of, the, tarsier, galago, classification, continued, for, many, years, until, 1898, when, dutch, zoologist, ambrosius, hubrecht, demonstrated, two, different, types, of, placentation, formation, of, a, placenta, in, the, two, groups, english, comparative, anatomist, william, henry, flower, created, the, suborder, lemuroidea, in, 1883, to, distinguish, these, primates, from, the, simians, which, were, grouped, under, english, biologist, st, george, jackson, mivart, s, suborder, anthropoidea, simiiformes, according, to, flower, the, suborder, lemuroidea, contained, the, families, lemuridae, lemurs, lorises, and, galagos, chiromyidae, aye, aye, and, tarsiidae, tarsiers, lemuroidea, was, later, replaced, by, illiger, s, suborder, prosimii, many, years, earlier, in, 1812, geoffroy, first, named, the, suborder, strepsirrhini, in, which, he, included, the, tarsiers, this, taxonomy, went, unnoticed, until, 1918, when, pocock, compared, the, structure, of, the, nose, and, reinstated, the, use, of, the, suborder, strepsirrhini, while, also, moving, the, tarsiers, and, the, simians, into, a, new, suborder, haplorhini, it, was, not, until, 1953, when, british, anatomist, william, charles, osman, hill, wrote, an, entire, volume, on, strepsirrhine, anatomy, that, pocock, s, taxonomic, suggestion, became, noticed, and, more, widely, used, since, then, primate, taxonomy, has, shifted, between, strepsirrhini, haplorhini, and, prosimii, anthropoidea, multiple, times, most, of, the, academic, literature, provides, a, basic, framework, for, primate, taxonomy, usually, including, several, potential, taxonomic, schemes, although, most, experts, agree, upon, phylogeny, many, disagree, about, nearly, every, level, of, primate, classification, the, most, commonly, recurring, debate, in, primatology, during, the, 1970s, 1980s, and, early, 2000s, concerned, the, phylogenetic, position, of, tarsiers, compared, to, both, simians, and, the, other, prosimians, tarsiers, are, most, often, placed, in, either, the, suborder, haplorhini, with, the, simians, or, in, the, suborder, prosimii, with, the, strepsirrhines, prosimii, is, one, of, the, two, traditional, primate, suborders, and, is, based, on, evolutionary, grades, groups, united, by, anatomical, traits, rather, than, phylogenetic, clades, while, the, strepsirrhini, haplorrhini, taxonomy, was, based, on, evolutionary, relationships, yet, both, systems, persist, because, the, prosimii, anthropoidea, taxonomy, is, familiar, and, frequently, seen, in, the, research, literature, and, textbooks, strepsirrhines, are, traditionally, characterized, by, several, symplesiomorphic, ancestral, traits, not, shared, with, the, simians, particularly, the, rhinarium, other, symplesiomorphies, include, long, snouts, convoluted, maxilloturbinals, relatively, large, olfactory, bulbs, and, smaller, brains, the, toothcomb, is, a, synapomorphy, shared, derived, trait, seen, among, lemuriforms, although, it, is, frequently, and, incorrectly, used, to, define, the, strepsirrhine, clade, strepsirrhine, primates, are, also, united, in, possessing, an, epitheliochorial, placenta, unlike, the, tarsiers, and, simians, strepsirrhines, are, capable, of, producing, their, own, vitamin, c, and, do, not, need, it, supplied, in, their, diet, further, genetic, evidence, for, the, relationship, between, tarsiers, and, simians, as, a, haplorhine, clade, is, the, shared, possession, of, three, sine, markers, because, of, their, historically, mixed, assemblages, which, included, tarsiers, and, close, relatives, of, primates, both, prosimii, and, strepsirrhini, have, been, considered, wastebasket, taxa, for, lower, primates, regardless, the, strepsirrhine, and, haplorrhine, clades, are, generally, accepted, and, viewed, as, the, preferred, taxonomic, division, yet, tarsiers, still, closely, resemble, both, strepsirrhines, and, simians, in, different, ways, and, since, the, early, split, between, strepsirrhines, tarsiers, and, simians, is, ancient, and, hard, to, resolve, a, third, taxonomic, arrangement, with, three, suborders, is, sometimes, used, prosimii, tarsiiformes, and, anthropoidea, more, often, the, term, prosimian, is, no, longer, used, in, official, taxonomy, but, is, still, used, to, illustrate, the, behavioral, ecology, of, tarsiers, relative, to, the, other, primates, in, addition, to, the, controversy, over, tarsiers, the, debate, over, the, origins, of, simians, once, called, the, strepsirrhine, clade, into, question, arguments, for, an, evolutionary, link, between, adapiforms, and, simians, made, by, paleontologists, gingerich, elwyn, l, simons, tab, rasmussen, and, others, could, have, potentially, excluded, adapiforms, from, strepsirrhini, in, 1975, gingerich, proposed, a, new, suborder, simiolemuriformes, to, suggest, that, strepsirrhines, are, more, closely, related, to, simians, than, tarsiers, however, no, clear, relationship, between, the, two, had, been, demonstrated, by, the, early, 2000s, the, idea, reemerged, briefly, in, 2009, during, the, media, attention, surrounding, darwinius, masillae, dubbed, ida, a, cercamoniine, from, germany, that, was, touted, as, a, missing, link, between, humans, and, earlier, primates, simians, and, adapiforms, however, the, cladistic, analysis, was, flawed, and, the, phylogenetic, inferences, and, terminology, were, vague, although, the, authors, noted, that, darwinius, was, not, a, fossil, lemur, they, did, emphasize, the, absence, of, a, toothcomb, which, adapiforms, did, not, possess, adapiformes, stem, lemuriforms, daubentoniidae, other, lemurs, lorises, galagos, within, strepsirrhini, two, common, classifications, include, either, two, infraorders, adapiformes, and, lemuriformes, or, three, infraorders, adapiformes, lemuriformes, lorisiformes, a, less, common, taxonomy, places, the, aye, aye, daubentoniidae, in, its, own, infraorder, chiromyiformes, in, some, cases, plesiadapiforms, are, included, within, the, order, primates, in, which, case, euprimates, is, sometimes, treated, as, a, suborder, with, strepsirrhini, becoming, an, infraorder, and, the, lemuriformes, and, others, become, parvorders, regardless, of, the, infraordinal, taxonomy, strepsirrhini, is, composed, of, three, ranked, superfamilies, and, 14, families, seven, of, which, are, extinct, three, of, these, extinct, families, included, the, recently, extinct, giant, lemurs, of, madagascar, many, of, which, died, out, within, the, last, 1, 000, years, following, human, arrival, on, the, island, when, strepsirrhini, is, divided, into, two, infraorders, the, clade, containing, all, toothcombed, primates, can, be, called, lemuriforms, when, it, is, divided, into, three, infraorders, the, term, lemuriforms, refers, only, to, madagascar, s, lemurs, and, the, toothcombed, primates, are, referred, to, as, either, crown, strepsirrhines, or, extant, strepsirrhines, confusion, of, this, specific, terminology, with, the, general, term, strepsirrhine, along, with, oversimplified, anatomical, comparisons, and, vague, phylogenetic, inferences, can, lead, to, misconceptions, about, primate, phylogeny, and, misunderstandings, about, primates, from, the, eocene, as, seen, with, the, media, coverage, of, darwinius, because, the, skeletons, of, adapiforms, share, strong, similarities, with, those, of, lemurs, and, lorises, researchers, have, often, referred, to, them, as, primitive, strepsirrhines, lemur, ancestors, or, a, sister, group, to, the, living, strepsirrhines, they, are, included, in, strepsirrhini, and, are, considered, basal, members, of, the, clade, although, their, status, as, true, primates, is, not, questioned, the, questionable, relationship, between, adapiforms, and, other, living, and, fossil, primates, leads, to, multiple, classifications, within, strepsirrhini, often, adapiforms, are, placed, in, their, own, infraorder, due, to, anatomical, differences, with, lemuriforms, and, their, unclear, relationship, when, shared, traits, with, lemuriforms, which, may, or, may, not, be, synapomorphic, are, emphasized, they, are, sometimes, reduced, to, families, within, the, infraorder, lemuriformes, or, superfamily, lemuroidea, the, first, fossil, primate, described, was, the, adapiform, adapis, parisiensis, by, french, naturalist, georges, cuvier, in, 1821, who, compared, it, to, a, hyrax, le, daman, then, considered, a, member, of, a, now, obsolete, group, called, pachyderms, it, was, not, recognized, as, a, primate, until, it, was, reevaluated, in, the, early, 1870s, originally, adapiforms, were, all, included, under, the, family, adapidae, which, was, divided, into, two, or, three, subfamilies, adapinae, notharctinae, and, sometimes, sivaladapinae, all, north, american, adapiforms, were, lumped, under, notharctinae, while, the, old, world, forms, were, usually, assigned, to, adapinae, around, the, 1990s, two, distinct, groups, of, european, adapids, began, to, emerge, based, on, differences, in, the, postcranial, skeleton, and, the, teeth, one, of, these, two, european, forms, was, identified, as, cercamoniines, which, were, allied, with, the, notharctids, found, mostly, in, north, america, while, the, other, group, falls, into, the, traditional, adapid, classification, the, three, major, adapiform, divisions, are, now, typically, regarded, as, three, families, within, adapiformes, notharctidae, adapidae, and, sivaladapidae, but, other, divisions, ranging, from, one, to, five, families, are, used, as, well, all, lemuriforms, possess, a, specialized, dental, structure, called, a, toothcomb, with, the, exception, of, the, aye, aye, in, which, the, structure, has, been, modified, into, two, continually, growing, hypselodont, incisors, or, canine, teeth, similar, to, those, of, rodents, often, the, toothcomb, is, incorrectly, used, to, characterize, all, strepsirrhines, instead, it, is, unique, to, lemuriforms, and, is, not, seen, among, adapiforms, lemuriforms, groom, orally, and, also, possess, a, grooming, claw, on, the, second, toe, of, each, foot, for, scratching, in, areas, that, are, inaccessible, to, the, mouth, and, tongue, adapiforms, may, have, had, a, grooming, claw, but, there, is, little, evidence, of, this, the, toothcomb, consists, of, either, two, or, four, procumbent, lower, incisors, and, procumbent, lower, canine, teeth, followed, by, a, canine, shaped, premolar, it, is, used, to, comb, the, fur, during, oral, grooming, shed, hairs, that, accumulate, between, the, teeth, of, the, toothcomb, are, removed, by, the, sublingua, or, under, tongue, adapiforms, did, not, possess, a, toothcomb, instead, their, lower, incisors, varied, in, orientation, from, somewhat, procumbent, to, somewhat, vertical, and, the, lower, canines, were, projected, upwards, and, were, often, prominent, like, all, primates, strepsirrhine, orbits, eye, sockets, have, a, postorbital, bar, a, protective, ring, of, bone, created, by, a, connection, between, the, frontal, and, zygomatic, bones, both, living, and, extinct, strepsirrhines, lack, a, thin, wall, of, bone, behind, the, eye, referred, to, as, postorbital, closure, which, is, only, seen, in, haplorhine, primates, although, the, eyes, of, strepsirrhines, point, forward, giving, stereoscopic, vision, the, orbits, do, not, face, fully, forward, among, living, strepsirrhines, most, or, all, species, are, thought, to, possess, a, reflective, layer, behind, the, retina, of, the, eye, called, a, tapetum, lucidum, consisting, of, riboflavin, crystals, which, improves, vision, in, low, light, but, they, lack, a, fovea, which, improves, day, vision, this, differs, from, tarsiers, which, lack, a, tapetum, lucidum, but, possess, a, fovea, strepsirrhine, primates, have, a, brain, relatively, comparable, to, or, slightly, larger, in, size, than, most, mammals, compared, to, simians, however, they, have, a, relatively, small, brain, to, body, size, ratio, strepsirrhines, are, also, traditionally, noted, for, their, unfused, mandibular, symphysis, two, halves, of, the, lower, jaw, however, fusion, of, the, mandibular, symphysis, was, common, in, adapiforms, notably, notharctus, also, several, extinct, giant, lemurs, exhibited, a, fused, mandibular, symphysis, many, nocturnal, species, have, large, independently, movable, ears, although, there, are, significant, differences, in, sizes, and, shapes, of, the, ear, between, species, the, structure, of, the, middle, and, inner, ear, of, strepsirrhines, differs, between, the, lemurs, and, lorisoids, in, lemurs, the, tympanic, cavity, which, surrounds, the, middle, ear, is, expanded, this, leaves, the, ectotympanic, ring, which, supports, the, eardrum, free, within, the, auditory, bulla, this, trait, is, also, seen, in, adapiforms, in, lorisoids, however, the, tympanic, cavity, is, smaller, and, the, ectotympanic, ring, becomes, attached, to, the, edge, of, the, auditory, bulla, the, tympanic, cavity, in, lorisoids, also, has, two, accessory, air, spaces, which, are, not, present, in, lemurs, both, lorisoids, and, cheirogaleid, lemurs, have, replaced, the, internal, carotid, artery, with, an, enlarged, ascending, pharyngeal, artery, strepsirrhines, also, possess, distinctive, features, in, their, tarsus, ankle, bones, that, differentiate, them, from, haplorhines, such, as, a, sloping, talo, fibular, facet, the, face, where, the, talus, bone, and, fibula, meet, and, a, difference, in, the, location, of, the, position, of, the, flexor, fibularis, tendon, on, the, talus, these, differences, give, strepsirrhines, the, ability, to, make, more, complex, rotations, of, the, ankle, and, indicate, that, their, feet, are, habitually, inverted, or, turned, inward, an, adaptation, for, grasping, vertical, supports, sexual, dichromatism, different, coloration, patterns, between, males, and, females, can, be, seen, in, most, brown, lemur, species, but, otherwise, lemurs, show, very, little, if, any, difference, in, body, size, or, weight, between, sexes, this, lack, of, sexual, dimorphism, is, not, characteristic, of, all, strepsirrhines, some, adapiforms, were, sexually, dimorphic, with, males, bearing, a, larger, sagittal, crest, a, ridge, of, bone, on, the, top, of, the, skull, to, which, jaw, muscles, attach, and, canine, teeth, lorisoids, exhibit, some, sexual, dimorphism, but, males, are, typically, no, more, than, 20, percent, larger, than, females, strepsirrhines, have, a, long, snout, that, ends, in, a, moist, and, touch, sensitive, rhinarium, similar, to, that, of, dogs, and, many, other, mammals, the, rhinarium, is, surrounded, by, vibrissae, that, are, also, sensitive, to, touch, convoluted, maxilloturbinals, on, the, inside, of, their, nose, filter, warm, and, moisten, the, incoming, air, while, olfactory, receptors, of, the, main, olfactory, system, lining, the, ethmoturbinals, detect, airborne, smells, the, olfactory, bulbs, of, lemurs, are, comparable, in, size, to, those, of, other, arboreal, mammals, the, surface, of, the, rhinarium, does, not, have, any, olfactory, receptors, so, it, is, not, used, for, smell, in, terms, of, detecting, volatile, substances, instead, it, has, sensitive, touch, receptors, merkel, cells, the, rhinarium, upper, lip, and, gums, are, tightly, connected, by, a, fold, of, mucous, membrane, called, the, philtrum, which, runs, from, the, tip, of, the, nose, to, the, mouth, the, upper, lip, is, constrained, by, this, connection, and, has, fewer, nerves, to, control, movement, which, leaves, it, less, mobile, than, the, upper, lips, of, simians, the, philtrum, creates, a, gap, diastema, between, the, roots, of, the, first, two, upper, incisors, the, strepsirrhine, rhinarium, can, collect, relatively, non, volatile, fluid, based, chemicals, traditionally, categorized, as, pheromones, and, transmit, them, to, the, vomeronasal, organ, vno, which, is, located, below, and, in, front, of, the, nasal, cavity, above, the, mouth, the, vno, is, an, encased, duct, like, structure, made, of, cartilage, and, is, isolated, from, the, air, passing, through, the, nasal, cavity, the, vno, is, connected, to, the, mouth, through, nasopalatine, ducts, which, communicate, via, the, incisive, foramen, which, pass, through, the, hard, palate, at, the, top, front, of, the, mouth, fluids, traveling, from, the, rhinarium, to, the, mouth, and, then, up, the, nasopalatine, ducts, to, the, vno, are, detected, and, information, is, relayed, to, the, accessory, olfactory, bulb, which, is, relatively, large, in, strepsirrhines, from, the, accessory, olfactory, bulb, information, is, sent, to, the, amygdala, which, handles, emotions, and, then, to, the, hypothalamus, which, handles, basic, body, functions, and, metabolic, processes, this, neural, pathway, differs, from, that, used, by, the, main, olfactory, system, all, lemuriforms, have, a, vno, as, do, tarsiers, and, some, new, world, monkeys, adapiforms, exhibit, the, gap, between, the, upper, incisors, which, indicates, the, presence, of, a, vno, but, there, is, some, disagreement, over, whether, or, not, they, possessed, a, rhinarium, extant, strepsirrhines, have, an, epitheliochorial, placenta, where, the, maternal, blood, does, not, come, in, direct, contact, with, the, fetal, chorion, like, it, does, in, the, hemochorial, placenta, of, haplorhines, the, strepsirrhine, uterus, has, two, distinct, chambers, bicornuate, despite, having, similar, gestation, periods, to, comparably, sized, haplorhines, fetal, growth, rates, are, generally, slower, in, strepsirrhines, which, results, in, newborn, offspring, that, are, as, little, as, one, third, the, size, of, haplorhine, newborns, extant, strepsirrhines, also, have, a, lower, basal, metabolic, rate, which, elevates, in, females, during, gestation, putting, greater, demands, on, the, mother, most, primates, have, two, mammary, glands, but, the, number, and, positions, vary, between, species, within, strepsirrhines, lorises, have, two, pairs, while, others, like, the, ring, tailed, lemur, have, one, pair, on, the, chest, pectoral, the, aye, aye, also, has, two, mammary, glands, but, they, are, located, near, the, groin, inguinal, in, females, the, clitoris, is, sometimes, enlarged, and, pendulous, resembling, the, male, penis, which, can, make, sex, identification, difficult, for, human, observers, the, clitoris, may, also, have, a, bony, structure, in, it, similar, to, the, baculum, penis, bone, in, males, most, male, primates, have, a, baculum, but, it, is, typically, larger, in, strepsirrhines, and, usually, forked, at, the, tip, approximately, three, quarters, of, all, extant, strepsirrhine, species, are, nocturnal, sleeping, in, nests, made, from, dead, leaves, or, tree, hollows, during, the, day, all, of, the, lorisoids, from, continental, africa, and, asia, are, nocturnal, a, circumstance, that, minimizes, their, competition, with, the, simian, primates, of, the, region, which, are, diurnal, the, lemurs, of, madagascar, living, in, the, absence, of, simians, are, more, variable, in, their, activity, cycles, the, aye, aye, mouse, lemurs, woolly, lemurs, and, sportive, lemurs, are, nocturnal, while, ring, tailed, lemurs, and, most, of, their, kin, sifakas, and, indri, are, diurnal, yet, some, or, all, of, the, brown, lemurs, eulemur, are, cathemeral, which, means, that, they, may, be, active, during, the, day, or, night, depending, on, factors, such, as, temperature, and, predation, many, extant, strepsirrhines, are, well, adapted, for, nocturnal, activity, due, to, their, relatively, large, eyes, large, movable, ears, sensitive, tactile, hairs, strong, sense, of, smell, and, the, tapetum, lucidum, behind, the, retina, among, the, adapiforms, most, are, considered, diurnal, with, the, exception, of, pronycticebus, and, godinotia, from, middle, eocene, europe, both, of, which, had, large, orbits, that, suggest, nocturnality, reproduction, in, most, strepsirrhine, species, tends, to, be, seasonal, particularly, in, lemurs, key, factors, that, affect, seasonal, reproduction, include, the, length, of, the, wet, season, subsequent, food, availability, and, the, maturation, time, of, the, species, like, other, primates, strepsirrhines, are, relatively, slow, breeders, compared, to, other, mammals, their, gestation, period, and, interbirth, intervals, are, usually, long, and, the, young, develop, slowly, just, like, in, haplorhine, primates, unlike, simians, some, strepsirrhines, produce, two, or, three, offspring, although, some, produce, only, a, single, offspring, those, that, produce, multiple, offspring, tend, to, build, nests, for, their, young, these, two, traits, are, thought, to, be, plesiomorphic, ancestral, for, primates, the, young, are, precocial, relatively, mature, and, mobile, at, birth, but, not, as, coordinated, as, ungulates, hoofed, mammals, infant, care, by, the, mother, is, relatively, prolonged, compared, to, many, other, mammals, and, in, some, cases, the, infants, cling, to, the, mother, s, fur, with, their, hands, and, feet, despite, their, relatively, smaller, brains, compared, to, other, primates, lemurs, have, demonstrated, levels, of, technical, intelligence, in, problem, solving, that, are, comparable, to, those, seen, in, simians, however, their, social, intelligence, differs, often, emphasizing, within, group, competition, over, cooperation, which, may, be, due, to, adaptations, for, their, unpredictable, environment, although, lemurs, have, not, been, observed, using, objects, as, tools, in, the, wild, they, can, be, trained, to, use, objects, as, tools, in, captivity, and, demonstrate, a, basic, understanding, about, the, functional, properties, of, the, objects, they, are, using, the, nocturnal, strepsirrhines, have, been, traditionally, described, as, solitary, although, this, term, is, no, longer, favored, by, the, researchers, who, study, them, many, are, considered, solitary, foragers, but, many, exhibit, complex, and, diverse, social, organization, often, overlapping, home, ranges, initiating, social, contact, at, night, and, sharing, sleeping, sites, during, the, day, even, the, mating, systems, are, variable, as, seen, in, woolly, lemurs, which, live, in, monogamous, breeding, pairs, because, of, this, social, diversity, among, these, solitary, but, social, primates, whose, level, of, social, interaction, is, comparable, to, that, of, diurnal, simians, alternative, classifications, have, been, proposed, to, emphasize, their, gregarious, dispersed, or, solitary, nature, among, extant, strepsirrhines, only, the, diurnal, and, cathemeral, lemurs, have, evolved, to, live, in, multi, male, multi, female, groups, comparable, to, most, living, simians, this, social, trait, seen, in, two, extant, lemur, families, indriidae, and, lemuridae, is, thought, to, have, evolved, independently, group, sizes, are, smaller, in, social, lemurs, than, in, simians, and, despite, the, similarities, the, community, structures, differ, female, dominance, which, is, rare, in, simians, is, fairly, common, in, lemurs, strepsirrhines, spend, a, considerable, amount, of, time, grooming, each, other, allogrooming, when, lemuriform, primates, groom, they, lick, the, fur, and, then, comb, it, with, their, toothcomb, they, also, use, their, grooming, claw, to, scratch, places, they, cannot, reach, with, their, mouth, like, new, world, monkeys, strepsirrhines, rely, on, scent, marking, for, much, of, their, communication, this, involves, smearing, secretions, from, epidermal, scent, glands, on, tree, branches, along, with, urine, and, feces, in, some, cases, strepsirrhines, may, anoint, themselves, with, urine, urine, washing, body, postures, and, gestures, may, be, used, although, the, long, snout, non, mobile, lips, and, reduced, facial, enervation, restrict, the, use, of, facial, expressions, in, strepsirrhines, short, range, calls, long, range, calls, and, alarm, calls, are, also, used, nocturnal, species, are, more, constrained, by, the, lack, of, light, so, their, communication, systems, differ, from, those, of, diurnal, species, often, using, long, range, calls, to, claim, their, territory, living, strepsirrhines, are, predominantly, arboreal, with, only, the, ring, tailed, lemur, spending, considerable, time, on, the, ground, most, species, move, around, quadrupedally, on, four, legs, in, the, trees, including, five, genera, of, smaller, nocturnal, lemurs, galagos, indriids, sportive, lemurs, and, bamboo, lemurs, leap, from, vertical, surfaces, and, the, indriids, are, highly, specialized, for, vertical, clinging, and, leaping, lorises, are, slow, moving, deliberate, climbers, analyses, of, extinct, adapiforms, postcranial, skeletons, suggest, a, variety, of, locomotor, behavior, the, european, adapids, adapis, palaeolemur, and, leptadapis, shared, adaptations, for, slow, climbing, like, the, lorises, although, they, may, have, been, quadrupedal, runners, like, small, new, world, monkeys, both, notharctus, and, smilodectes, from, north, america, and, europolemur, from, europe, exhibit, limb, proportions, and, joint, surfaces, comparable, to, vertical, clinging, and, leaping, lemurs, but, were, not, as, specialized, as, indriids, for, vertical, clinging, suggesting, that, they, ran, along, branches, and, did, not, leap, as, much, notharctids, cantius, and, pronycticebus, appear, to, have, been, agile, arboreal, quadrupeds, with, adaptations, comparable, to, the, brown, lemurs, primates, primarily, feed, on, fruits, including, seeds, leaves, including, flowers, and, animal, prey, arthropods, small, vertebrates, and, eggs, diets, vary, markedly, between, strepsirrhine, species, like, other, leaf, eating, folivorous, primates, some, strepsirrhines, can, digest, cellulose, and, hemicellulose, some, strepsirrhines, such, as, the, galagos, slender, lorises, and, angwantibos, are, primarily, insectivorous, other, species, such, as, fork, marked, lemurs, and, needle, clawed, bushbabies, specialize, on, tree, gum, while, indriids, sportive, lemurs, and, bamboo, lemurs, are, folivores, many, strepsirrhines, are, frugivores, fruit, eaters, and, others, like, the, ring, tailed, lemur, and, mouse, lemurs, are, omnivores, eating, a, mix, of, fruit, leaves, and, animal, matter, among, the, adapiforms, frugivory, seems, to, have, been, the, most, common, diet, particularly, for, medium, sized, to, large, species, such, as, cantius, pelycodus, and, cercamonius, folivory, was, also, common, among, the, medium, and, large, sized, adapiforms, including, smilodectes, notharctus, adapis, and, leptadapis, sharp, cusps, on, the, teeth, of, some, of, the, smaller, adapiforms, such, as, anchomomys, and, donrussellia, indicate, that, they, were, either, partly, or, primarily, insectivorous, the, now, extinct, adapiform, primates, were, primarily, found, across, north, america, asia, and, europe, with, a, few, species, in, africa, they, flourished, during, the, eocene, when, those, regions, were, more, tropical, in, nature, and, they, disappeared, when, the, climate, became, cooler, and, drier, today, the, lemuriforms, are, confined, in, the, tropics, ranging, between, 28, s, to, 26, n, latitude, lorises, are, found, both, in, equatorial, africa, and, southeast, asia, while, the, galagos, are, limited, to, the, forests, and, woodlands, of, sub, saharan, africa, lemurs, are, endemic, to, madagascar, although, much, of, their, diversity, and, habitat, has, been, lost, due, to, recent, human, activity, as, with, nearly, all, primates, strepsirrhines, typically, reside, in, tropical, rainforests, these, habitats, allow, strepsirrhines, and, other, primates, to, evolve, diverse, communities, of, sympatric, species, in, the, eastern, rainforests, of, madagascar, as, many, as, 11, or, 12, species, share, the, same, forests, and, prior, to, human, arrival, some, forests, had, nearly, double, that, diversity, several, species, of, lemur, are, found, in, drier, seasonal, forests, including, the, spiny, forest, on, the, southern, tip, of, the, island, although, the, lemur, communities, in, these, regions, are, not, as, rich, like, all, other, non, human, primates, strepsirrhines, face, an, elevated, risk, of, extinction, due, to, human, activity, particularly, deforestation, in, tropical, regions, much, of, their, habitat, has, been, converted, for, human, use, such, as, agriculture, and, pasture, the, threats, facing, strepsirrhine, primates, fall, into, three, main, categories, habitat, destruction, hunting, for, bushmeat, or, traditional, medicine, and, live, capture, for, export, or, local, exotic, pet, trade, although, hunting, is, often, prohibited, the, laws, protecting, them, are, rarely, enforced, in, madagascar, local, taboos, known, as, fady, sometimes, help, protect, lemur, species, although, some, are, still, hunted, for, traditional, medicine, in, 2012, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, announced, that, lemurs, were, the, most, endangered, mammals, due, largely, to, elevated, illegal, logging, and, hunting, following, a, political, crisis, in, 2009, in, southeast, asia, slow, lorises, are, threatened, by, the, exotic, pet, trade, and, traditional, medicine, in, addition, to, habitat, destruction, both, lemurs, and, slow, lorises, are, protected, from, commercial, international, trade, under, cites, appendix, i
