parkinson, s, disease, pd, or, simply, parkinson, s, is, a, neurodegenerative, disease, of, mainly, the, central, nervous, system, that, affects, both, the, motor, and, non, motor, systems, of, the, body, the, symptoms, usually, emerge, slowly, and, as, the, disease, progresses, non, motor, symptoms, become, more, common, usual, symptoms, include, tremors, slowness, of, movement, rigidity, and, difficulty, with, balance, collectively, known, as, parkinsonism, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, falls, and, neuropsychiatric, problems, such, as, sleep, abnormalities, psychosis, mood, swings, or, behavioral, changes, may, also, arise, in, advanced, stages, most, cases, of, parkinson, s, disease, are, sporadic, but, a, few, contributing, factors, have, been, identified, pathophysiology, is, characterized, by, progressively, expanding, nerve, cell, death, originating, in, substantia, nigra, a, midbrain, region, that, supplies, dopamine, to, the, basal, ganglia, a, system, involved, in, voluntary, motor, control, the, cause, of, this, cell, death, is, poorly, understood, but, involves, alpha, synuclein, aggregation, into, lewy, bodies, within, the, neurons, other, possible, factors, involve, genetic, and, environmental, mechanisms, medications, lifestyle, and, previous, conditions, diagnosis, is, mainly, based, on, signs, and, symptoms, usually, motor, related, found, via, neurological, examination, though, medical, imaging, like, neuromelanin, mri, can, support, the, diagnosis, usual, onset, is, in, people, over, 60, years, of, age, of, whom, about, one, percent, are, affected, in, those, younger, than, 50, it, is, termed, early, onset, pd, no, cure, is, known, treatment, aims, to, mitigate, symptoms, initial, treatment, typically, includes, l, dopa, mao, b, inhibitors, or, dopamine, agonists, as, the, disease, progresses, these, medications, become, less, effective, and, produce, a, side, effect, marked, by, involuntary, muscle, movements, diet, and, certain, forms, of, rehabilitation, have, shown, some, effectiveness, at, improving, symptoms, deep, brain, stimulation, has, been, used, to, reduce, severe, motor, symptoms, when, drugs, are, ineffective, there, is, little, evidence, for, treatment, of, the, non, movement, related, symptoms, such, as, sleep, disturbances, and, mood, instability, the, average, life, expectancy, is, near, normal, parkinson, s, disease, pd, is, a, neurodegenerative, disease, affecting, both, the, central, and, peripheral, nervous, systems, characterized, by, the, loss, of, dopamine, producing, neurons, in, the, substantia, nigra, region, of, the, brain, it, is, classified, as, a, synucleinopathy, due, to, the, abnormal, accumulation, of, the, protein, alpha, synuclein, which, aggregates, into, lewy, bodies, within, affected, neurons, the, loss, of, dopamine, producing, neurons, in, the, substantia, nigra, initially, presents, as, movement, abnormalities, leading, to, parkinson, s, further, categorization, as, a, movement, disorder, in, 30, of, cases, disease, progression, leads, to, the, cognitive, decline, known, as, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, pdd, alongside, dementia, with, lewy, bodies, pdd, is, one, of, the, two, subtypes, of, lewy, body, dementia, the, four, cardinal, motor, symptoms, of, parkinson, s, bradykinesia, slowed, movements, postural, instability, rigidity, and, tremor, are, referred, to, as, parkinsonism, these, four, symptoms, are, not, exclusive, to, parkinson, s, and, can, occur, in, many, other, conditions, including, hiv, infection, and, recreational, drug, use, neurodegenerative, diseases, that, feature, parkinsonism, but, have, distinct, features, are, grouped, under, the, separate, umbrella, of, parkinson, plus, syndromes, or, alternatively, atypical, parkinsonian, disorders, parkinson, s, disease, can, result, from, genetic, factors, or, be, idiopathic, in, which, there, is, no, clearly, identifiable, cause, the, latter, also, termed, as, sporadic, parkinson, s, makes, up, some, 85, 90, of, cases, the, defining, symptoms, affect, the, motor, system, and, include, tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and, postural, instability, other, symptoms, may, affect, the, autonomic, or, sensory, nervous, system, mood, behavior, sleep, patterns, and, cognition, non, motor, symptoms, may, precede, the, onset, of, motor, symptoms, by, up, to, 20, years, these, include, constipation, anosmia, mood, disorders, and, rem, sleep, behavior, disorder, among, others, in, general, motor, symptoms, such, as, postural, instability, and, gait, abnormalities, tend, to, appear, as, the, disease, progresses, four, motor, symptoms, are, considered, as, cardinal, signs, in, pd, tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and, postural, instability, collectively, known, as, parkinsonism, however, other, motor, associated, symptoms, are, common, tremor, is, the, most, common, presenting, sign, and, may, appear, at, rest, as, well, as, during, intentional, movement, with, a, frequency, between, 4, 6, hertz, cycles, per, second, pd, tremor, tends, to, occur, in, the, hands, but, can, affect, other, parts, of, the, body, such, as, legs, arms, tongue, or, lips, as, well, it, is, often, described, as, pill, rolling, the, tendency, of, the, index, finger, and, thumb, to, touch, and, perform, a, circular, movement, that, reminds, of, the, early, pharmaceutical, technique, of, manually, making, pills, despite, it, being, the, most, noticeable, sign, tremor, is, present, in, only, about, 70, 90, percent, of, cases, bradykinesia, is, often, considered, the, most, important, feature, of, parkinson, s, disease, and, is, also, present, in, atypical, parkinsonism, it, describes, difficulties, in, motor, planning, beginning, and, executing, resulting, in, overall, slowed, movement, with, reduced, amplitude, which, affects, sequential, and, simultaneous, tasks, hence, it, interferes, with, daily, activities, such, as, dressing, feeding, and, bathing, facial, muscles, involved, in, bradykinesia, lead, to, the, characteristic, reduced, facial, expression, known, as, masked, face, or, hypomimia, rigidity, also, referred, to, as, rigor, or, stiffness, is, the, increased, resistance, during, passive, mobilization, of, a, limb, affecting, up, to, 89, percent, of, cases, it, usually, occurs, after, onset, of, tremor, and, bradykinesia, on, one, or, both, sides, of, the, body, and, can, lead, to, muscle, or, joint, pain, as, the, disease, progresses, as, of, 2024, it, remains, unclear, whether, rigidity, is, caused, by, a, distinct, biomechanical, process, or, if, it, is, the, manifestation, of, another, cardinal, sign, of, pd, postural, instability, pi, is, typical, in, the, later, stages, of, the, disease, leading, to, impaired, balance, and, falls, and, secondarily, to, bone, fractures, thus, reduced, mobility, and, quality, of, life, pi, is, absent, in, the, initial, stages, and, usually, occurs, 10, 15, years, after, first, diagnosis, within, the, first, three, years, after, disease, onset, pi, may, indicate, atypical, parkinsonism, while, some, sources, may, still, refer, to, the, cardinal, signs, as, the, classical, triad, out, of, tremor, bradykinesia, and, rigidity, pi, is, widely, accepted, as, the, fourth, defining, symptom, despite, its, unknown, mechanism, thus, forming, a, symptom, tetrad, together, with, bradykinesia, and, rigidity, it, is, responsible, for, the, typical, gait, characterized, by, short, shuffling, steps, and, forward, flexed, posture, other, common, motor, signs, include, a, slurred, and, quiet, voice, and, handwriting, that, progressively, becomes, smaller, this, latter, may, occur, prior, to, other, typical, symptoms, but, the, exact, neurobiological, mechanism, and, therefore, possible, connections, with, other, symptoms, remains, unknown, transformation, of, the, sensory, nervous, system, can, lead, to, changes, in, sensation, that, include, an, impaired, sense, of, smell, disturbed, vision, pain, and, paresthesia, problems, with, visuospatial, function, may, arise, and, lead, to, difficulties, in, facial, recognition, and, perception, of, the, orientation, of, drawn, lines, peripheral, neuropathy, is, known, to, be, present, in, up, to, 55, percent, of, pd, patients, while, it, is, responsible, for, most, of, paresthesia, and, pain, in, pd, its, role, in, postural, instability, and, motor, impairment, is, poorly, understood, alterations, in, the, autonomic, nervous, system, known, as, dysautonomia, are, associated, with, a, variety, of, symptoms, such, as, gastrointestinal, dysfunction, orthostatic, hypotension, excessive, sweating, or, urinary, incontinence, gastrointestinal, issues, include, constipation, impaired, stomach, emptying, immoderate, production, of, saliva, and, swallowing, difficulty, prevalence, up, to, 82, percent, complications, resulting, from, dysphagia, include, dehydration, malnutrition, weight, loss, and, aspiration, pneumonia, all, gastrointestinal, features, can, be, severe, enough, to, cause, discomfort, endanger, health, and, complicate, disease, management, despite, being, related, to, each, other, the, exact, mechanism, of, these, symptoms, remains, unknown, orthostatic, hypotension, is, the, sustained, drop, of, blood, pressure, by, at, least, 20, mmhg, systolic, or, 10, mmhg, diastolic, within, the, first, three, minutes, after, raising, to, an, upright, position, that, can, be, seen, in, 30, 50, percent, of, cases, low, blood, pressure, can, impair, the, perfusion, of, organs, situated, above, the, heart, particularly, the, brain, resulting, in, lightheadedness, this, can, eventually, lead, to, fainting, and, is, associated, with, higher, morbidity, and, mortality, other, autonomic, related, symptoms, include, excessive, sweating, urinary, incontinence, and, sexual, dysfunction, neuropsychiatric, symptoms, nps, are, common, and, range, from, mild, disturbances, to, severe, impairment, comprising, abnormalities, in, cognition, mood, behavior, or, thought, which, can, interfere, with, daily, activities, reduce, quality, of, life, and, increase, the, risk, for, admission, to, a, nursing, home, some, of, them, such, as, depression, and, anxiety, are, known, to, precede, characteristic, motor, signs, by, up, to, several, years, and, may, herald, the, development, of, pd, while, most, of, them, worsen, as, the, disease, progresses, research, indicates, that, patients, with, more, severe, motor, symptoms, are, at, higher, risk, for, any, nps, conversely, nps, can, worsen, pd, depression, is, the, most, common, nps, and, occurs, in, nearly, half, of, all, patients, it, features, low, mood, and, lack, of, pleasure, and, is, more, prevalent, in, females, the, diagnosis, can, be, challenging, since, some, symptoms, of, depression, such, as, psychomotor, retardation, memory, problems, or, altered, appetite, share, similarities, with, psychiatric, signs, caused, by, pd, it, may, result, in, suicidal, ideation, which, is, more, prevalent, in, pd, nonetheless, suicidal, attempts, themselves, are, lower, than, in, the, general, population, apathy, is, characterized, by, emotional, indifference, and, arises, in, about, 46, percent, of, cases, diagnosis, is, difficult, as, it, may, become, indistinct, from, symptoms, of, depression, anxiety, disorders, develop, in, around, 43, percent, of, cases, the, most, common, are, panic, disorder, generalized, anxiety, disorder, and, social, anxiety, disorder, anxiety, is, known, to, cause, deterioration, in, the, symptoms, of, pd, parkinson, s, disease, psychosis, pdp, is, present, in, around, 20, percent, of, cases, and, comprises, hallucinations, illusions, and, delusions, it, is, associated, with, dopaminergic, drugs, used, to, treat, the, motor, symptoms, higher, morbidity, mortality, a, decrease, in, health, promoting, behaviors, and, longer, nursing, home, stays, additionally, it, correlates, with, depression, and, may, herald, onset, of, dementia, in, advanced, stages, unlike, other, psychotic, forms, pdp, typically, presents, with, a, clear, sensorium, it, might, overlap, with, other, psychiatric, symptoms, making, the, diagnosis, challenging, impulse, control, disorders, icd, can, be, seen, in, approximately, 19, percent, of, all, patients, and, in, the, context, of, pd, are, grouped, along, with, compulsive, behavior, and, dopamine, dysregulation, syndrome, dds, within, the, broader, spectrum, of, impulsive, and, compulsive, behaviors, icb, they, are, characterized, by, impulsivity, and, difficulty, to, control, impulsive, urges, and, are, positively, correlated, with, the, use, of, dopamine, agonists, cognitive, disturbances, can, occur, in, early, stages, or, before, diagnosis, and, increase, in, prevalence, and, severity, with, duration, of, the, disease, ranging, from, mild, cognitive, impairment, to, severe, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, they, feature, executive, dysfunction, slowed, cognitive, processing, speed, and, disrupted, perception, and, estimation, of, time, sleep, disorders, are, common, in, pd, and, affect, about, two, thirds, of, all, patients, they, comprise, insomnia, excessive, daytime, sleepiness, eds, restless, legs, syndrome, rls, rem, sleep, behavior, disorder, rbd, and, sleep, disordered, breathing, sdb, many, of, which, can, be, worsened, by, medication, rbd, may, begin, years, prior, to, the, initial, motor, symptoms, individual, presentation, of, symptoms, vary, although, most, of, people, affected, by, pd, show, an, altered, circadian, rhythm, at, some, point, of, disease, progression, pd, is, associated, with, a, variety, of, skin, disorders, that, include, melanoma, seborrheic, dermatitis, bullous, pemphigoid, and, rosacea, seborrheic, dermatitis, is, recognized, as, a, premotor, feature, that, indicates, dysautonomia, and, demonstrates, that, pd, can, be, detected, not, only, by, changes, of, nervous, tissue, but, tissue, abnormalities, outside, the, nervous, system, as, well, as, of, 2024, the, underlying, cause, of, pd, is, unknown, yet, is, assumed, to, be, influenced, primarily, by, an, interaction, of, genetic, and, environmental, factors, nonetheless, the, most, significant, risk, factor, is, age, with, a, prevalence, of, 1, percent, in, those, aged, over, 65, and, approximately, 4, 3, percent, in, age, over, 85, genetic, components, comprise, snca, lrrk2, and, park2, among, others, while, environmental, risks, include, exposure, to, pesticides, or, heavy, metals, timing, of, exposure, factor, may, influence, the, progression, or, severity, of, certain, stages, 46, however, caffeine, and, nicotine, exhibit, neuroprotective, features, hence, lowering, the, risk, of, pd, about, 85, percent, of, cases, occur, sporadic, meaning, that, there, is, no, family, history, pd, in, a, narrow, sense, can, be, seen, as, a, genetic, disease, heritability, is, estimated, to, lie, between, 22, and, 40, percent, across, different, ethnicities, around, 15, percent, of, diagnosed, individuals, have, a, family, history, from, which, 5, 10, percent, can, be, attributed, to, a, causative, risk, gene, mutation, although, harboring, one, of, these, mutations, may, not, lead, to, the, disease, as, of, 2024, around, 90, genetic, risk, variants, across, 78, genomic, loci, have, been, identified, notable, risk, genes, include, snca, lrrk2, and, vps35, for, autosomal, dominant, inheritance, and, prkn, pink1, and, dj1, for, autosomal, recessive, inheritance, additionally, mutations, in, the, gba1, gene, linked, to, gaucher, s, disease, are, found, in, 5, 10, percent, of, pd, cases, alpha, synuclein, asyn, a, protein, encoded, by, snca, gene, is, thought, to, be, primarily, responsible, lewy, body, aggregation, asyn, activates, atm, serine, threonine, kinase, a, major, dna, damage, repair, signaling, kinase, and, non, homologous, end, joining, dna, repair, pathway, identifying, environmental, risk, factors, and, causality, is, difficult, due, to, the, disease, s, often, decade, long, prodromal, period, 46, most, noteworthy, environmental, factors, include, pesticide, exposure, and, contact, with, heavy, metals, in, particular, exposure, to, pesticides, such, as, paraquat, rotenone, benomyl, and, mancozeb, causes, one, in, five, cases, implying, an, association, with, the, onset, of, pd, risk, is, increased, by, co, exposure, to, for, example, glyphosate, and, mptp, harmful, heavy, metals, include, mainly, manganese, iron, lead, mercury, aluminium, and, cadmium, on, the, other, hand, magnesium, shows, neuroprotective, features, other, chemical, compounds, include, trichloroethylene, and, mptp, traumatic, brain, injury, is, also, strongly, implicated, as, a, risk, factor, additionally, although, the, underlying, cause, is, unknown, melanoma, is, documented, to, be, associated, with, pd, low, levels, of, urate, in, the, blood, are, associated, with, an, increased, risk, while, helicobacter, pylori, infection, can, prevent, the, absorption, of, some, drugs, including, l, dopa, main, pathological, feature, is, cell, death, of, dopamine, releasing, neurons, within, among, other, regions, the, basal, ganglia, more, precisely, pars, compacta, of, substantia, nigra, and, partially, striatum, thus, impeding, nigrostriatal, pathway, of, the, dopaminergic, system, which, plays, a, central, role, in, motor, control, three, major, pathways, connect, the, basal, ganglia, to, other, brain, areas, direct, indirect, and, hyperdirect, pathway, all, part, of, the, cortico, basal, ganglia, thalamo, cortical, loop, the, direct, pathway, projects, from, the, neocortex, to, putamen, or, caudate, nucleus, of, the, striatum, which, sends, inhibitory, gabaergic, signals, to, substantia, nigra, pars, reticulata, snpr, and, internal, globus, pallidus, gpi, this, inhibition, reduces, gabaergic, signaling, to, ventral, lateral, vl, and, ventral, anterior, va, nuclei, of, the, thalamus, thereby, promoting, their, projections, to, the, motor, cortex, the, indirect, pathway, projects, inhibition, from, striatum, to, external, globus, pallidus, gpe, reducing, its, gabaergic, inhibition, of, the, subthalamic, nucleus, pars, reticulata, and, internal, globus, pallidus, this, reduction, in, inhibition, allows, the, subthalamic, nucleus, to, excite, internal, globus, pallidus, and, pars, reticulata, which, in, turn, inhibit, thalamic, activity, thereby, suppressing, excitatory, signals, to, the, motor, cortex, the, hyperdirect, pathway, is, an, additional, glutamatergic, pathway, that, projects, from, the, frontal, lobe, to, subthalamic, nucleus, modulating, basal, ganglia, activity, with, rapid, excitatory, input, the, striatum, and, other, basal, ganglia, structures, contain, d1, and, d2, receptor, neurons, that, modulate, the, previously, described, pathways, consequently, dopaminergic, dysfunction, in, these, systems, can, disrupt, their, respective, components, motor, oculomotor, associative, limbic, and, orbitofrontal, circuits, each, named, for, its, primary, projection, area, leading, to, symptoms, related, to, movement, attention, and, learning, in, the, disease, alpha, synuclein, asyn, is, a, protein, involved, in, synaptic, vesicle, trafficking, intracellular, transport, and, neurotransmitter, release, in, pd, it, can, be, overexpressed, misfolded, and, subsequently, form, clumps, on, axon, terminals, and, other, structures, inside, a, neuron, for, example, the, mitochondria, and, nucleus, this, aggregation, forms, lewy, bodies, which, are, involved, in, neuronal, necrosis, and, dysfunction, of, neurotransmitters, a, vicious, cycle, linked, to, neurodegeneration, involves, oxidative, stress, mitochondria, and, neuroimmune, function, particularly, inflammation, normal, metabolism, of, dopamine, tends, to, fail, leading, to, elevated, levels, of, reactive, oxygen, species, ros, which, is, cytotoxic, and, causes, cellular, damage, to, lipids, proteins, dna, and, especially, mitochondria, mitochondrial, damage, triggers, neuroinflammatory, responses, via, damage, associated, molecular, patterns, damps, resulting, in, aggregation, of, neuromelanin, and, therefore, fueling, further, neuroinflammation, by, activating, microglia, ferroptosis, is, suggested, as, another, significant, mechanism, in, disease, progression, it, is, characterized, by, cell, death, through, high, levels, of, lipid, hydroperoxide, one, mechanism, causing, brain, cell, death, results, from, abnormal, accumulation, of, the, protein, alpha, synuclein, bound, to, ubiquitin, in, damaged, cells, this, insoluble, protein, accumulates, inside, neurons, forming, inclusions, known, as, lewy, bodies, these, bodies, first, appear, in, the, olfactory, bulb, medulla, oblongata, and, pontine, tegmentum, individuals, at, this, stage, may, be, asymptomatic, or, have, early, nonmotor, symptoms, such, as, loss, of, sense, of, smell, or, some, sleep, or, automatic, dysfunction, as, the, disease, progresses, lewy, bodies, develop, in, the, substantia, nigra, areas, of, the, midbrain, and, basal, forebrain, and, finally, the, neocortex, these, brain, sites, are, the, main, places, of, neuronal, degeneration, in, pd, but, lewy, bodies, may, be, protective, from, cell, death, with, the, abnormal, protein, sequestered, or, walled, off, other, forms, of, alpha, synuclein, e, g, oligomers, that, are, not, aggregated, into, lewy, bodies, and, lewy, neurites, may, in, fact, be, the, toxic, forms, of, the, protein, in, people, with, dementia, a, generalized, presence, of, lewy, bodies, is, common, in, cortical, areas, neurofibrillary, tangles, and, senile, plaques, characteristic, of, alzheimer, s, disease, are, uncommon, unless, the, person, has, dementia, other, mechanisms, include, proteasomal, and, lysosomal, systems, dysfunction, and, reduced, mitochondrial, activity, iron, accumulation, in, the, substantia, nigra, is, typically, observed, in, conjunction, with, the, protein, inclusions, it, may, be, related, to, oxidative, stress, protein, aggregation, and, neuronal, death, but, the, mechanisms, are, obscure, the, neuroimmune, interaction, is, heavily, implicated, in, pd, pathology, pd, and, autoimmune, disorders, share, genetic, variations, and, molecular, pathways, some, autoimmune, diseases, may, even, increase, one, s, risk, of, developing, pd, up, to, 33, in, one, study, autoimmune, diseases, linked, to, protein, expression, profiles, of, monocytes, and, cd4, t, cells, are, linked, to, pd, herpes, virus, infections, can, trigger, autoimmune, reactions, to, alpha, synuclein, perhaps, through, molecular, mimicry, of, viral, proteins, alpha, synuclein, and, its, aggregate, form, lewy, bodies, can, bind, to, microglia, microglia, can, proliferate, and, be, over, activated, by, alpha, synuclein, binding, to, mhc, receptors, on, inflammasomes, bringing, about, a, release, of, proinflammatory, cytokines, like, il, 1, ifn, and, tnf, activated, microglia, influence, the, activation, of, astrocytes, converting, their, neuroprotective, phenotype, to, a, neurotoxic, one, astrocytes, in, healthy, brains, serve, to, protect, neuronal, connections, in, parkinson, s, disease, astrocytes, cannot, protect, the, dopaminergic, connections, in, the, striatum, microglia, present, antigens, via, mhc, i, and, mhc, ii, to, t, cells, cd4, t, cells, activated, by, this, process, are, able, to, cross, the, blood, brain, barrier, bbb, and, release, more, proinflammatory, cytokines, like, interferon, ifn, tnf, and, il, 1, mast, cell, degranulation, and, subsequent, proinflammatory, cytokine, release, is, implicated, in, bbb, breakdown, in, pd, another, immune, cell, implicated, in, pd, are, peripheral, monocytes, and, have, been, found, in, the, substantia, nigra, of, people, with, pd, these, monocytes, can, lead, to, more, dopaminergic, connection, breakdown, in, addition, monocytes, isolated, from, people, with, parkinson, s, disease, express, higher, levels, of, the, pd, associated, protein, lrrk2, compared, with, non, pd, individuals, via, vasodilation, in, addition, high, levels, of, pro, inflammatory, cytokines, such, as, il, 6, can, lead, to, the, production, of, c, reactive, protein, by, the, liver, another, protein, commonly, found, in, people, with, pd, that, can, lead, to, an, increase, in, peripheral, inflammation, peripheral, inflammation, can, affect, the, gut, brain, axis, an, area, of, the, body, highly, implicated, in, pd, people, with, pd, have, altered, gut, microbiota, and, colon, problems, years, before, motor, issues, arise, alpha, synuclein, is, produced, in, the, gut, and, may, migrate, via, the, vagus, nerve, to, the, brainstem, and, then, to, the, substantia, nigra, physician, s, initial, assessment, is, typically, based, on, medical, history, and, neurological, examination, they, assess, motor, symptoms, bradykinesia, rest, tremors, etc, using, clinical, diagnostic, criteria, the, finding, of, lewy, bodies, in, the, midbrain, on, autopsy, is, usually, considered, final, proof, that, the, person, had, pd, the, clinical, course, of, the, illness, over, time, may, diverge, from, pd, requiring, that, presentation, is, periodically, reviewed, to, confirm, the, accuracy, of, the, diagnosis, multiple, causes, can, occur, for, parkinsonism, or, diseases, that, look, similar, stroke, certain, medications, and, toxins, can, cause, secondary, parkinsonism, and, need, to, be, assessed, during, visit, parkinson, plus, syndromes, such, as, progressive, supranuclear, palsy, and, multiple, system, atrophy, must, be, considered, and, ruled, out, appropriately, to, begin, a, different, treatment, and, disease, progression, anti, parkinson, s, medications, are, typically, less, effective, at, controlling, symptoms, in, parkinson, plus, syndromes, faster, progression, rates, early, cognitive, dysfunction, or, postural, instability, minimal, tremor, or, symmetry, at, onset, may, indicate, a, parkinson, plus, disease, rather, than, pd, itself, medical, organizations, have, created, diagnostic, criteria, to, ease, and, standardize, the, diagnostic, process, especially, in, the, early, stages, of, the, disease, the, most, widely, known, criteria, come, from, the, uk, queen, square, brain, bank, for, neurological, disorders, and, the, u, s, national, institute, of, neurological, disorders, and, stroke, the, queen, square, brain, bank, criteria, require, slowness, of, movement, bradykinesia, plus, either, rigidity, resting, tremor, or, postural, instability, other, possible, causes, of, these, symptoms, need, to, be, ruled, out, finally, three, or, more, of, the, following, supportive, symptoms, are, required, during, onset, or, evolution, unilateral, onset, tremor, at, rest, progression, in, time, asymmetry, of, motor, symptoms, response, to, levodopa, for, at, least, five, years, the, clinical, course, of, at, least, ten, years, and, appearance, of, dyskinesias, induced, by, the, intake, of, excessive, levodopa, assessment, of, sudomotor, function, through, electrochemical, skin, conductance, can, be, helpful, in, diagnosing, dysautonomia, when, pd, diagnoses, are, checked, by, autopsy, movement, disorders, experts, are, found, on, average, to, be, 79, 6, accurate, at, initial, assessment, and, 83, 9, accurate, after, refining, diagnoses, at, follow, up, examinations, when, clinical, diagnoses, performed, mainly, by, nonexperts, are, checked, by, autopsy, the,

people, with, pd, usually, appear, normal, magnetic, resonance, imaging, has, become, more, accurate, in, diagnosis, of, the, disease, over, time, specifically, through, iron, sensitive, t2, and, susceptibility, weighted, imaging, sequences, at, a, magnetic, field, strength, of, at, least, 3t, both, of, which, can, demonstrate, absence, of, the, characteristic, swallow, tail, imaging, pattern, in, the, dorsolateral, substantia, nigra, in, a, meta, analysis, absence, of, this, pattern, was, highly, sensitive, and, specific, for, the, disease, a, meta, analysis, found, that, neuromelanin, mri, can, discriminate, individuals, with, parkinson, s, from, healthy, subjects, diffusion, mri, has, shown, potential, in, distinguishing, between, pd, and, parkinson, plus, syndromes, as, well, as, between, pd, motor, subtypes, though, its, diagnostic, value, is, still, under, investigation, ct, and, mri, are, used, to, rule, out, other, diseases, that, can, be, secondary, causes, of, parkinsonism, most, commonly, encephalitis, and, chronic, ischemic, insults, as, well, as, less, frequent, entities, such, as, basal, ganglia, tumors, and, hydrocephalus, the, metabolic, activity, of, dopamine, transporters, in, the, basal, ganglia, can, be, directly, measured, with, positron, emission, tomography, and, single, photon, emission, computed, tomography, scans, it, has, shown, high, agreement, with, clinical, diagnoses, of, pd, reduced, dopamine, related, activity, in, the, basal, ganglia, can, help, exclude, drug, induced, parkinsonism, this, finding, is, nonspecific, and, can, be, seen, with, both, pd, and, parkinson, plus, disorders, in, the, united, states, datscans, are, only, fda, approved, to, distinguish, pd, or, parkinsonian, syndromes, from, essential, tremor, iodine, 123, meta, iodobenzylguanidine, myocardial, scintigraphy, can, help, locate, denervation, of, the, muscles, of, the, heart, which, can, support, a, pd, diagnosis, secondary, parkinsonism, the, multiple, causes, of, parkinsonism, can, be, differentiated, through, careful, history, physical, examination, and, appropriate, imaging, other, parkinson, plus, syndromes, can, have, similar, movement, symptoms, but, have, a, variety, of, associated, symptoms, some, of, these, are, also, synucleinopathies, lewy, body, dementia, involves, motor, symptoms, with, early, onset, of, cognitive, dysfunction, and, hallucinations, which, precede, motor, symptoms, alternatively, multiple, systems, atrophy, or, msa, usually, has, early, onset, of, autonomic, dysfunction, such, as, orthostasis, and, may, have, autonomic, predominance, cerebellar, symptom, predominance, or, parkinsonian, predominance, other, parkinson, plus, syndromes, involve, tau, rather, than, alpha, synuclein, these, include, progressive, supranuclear, palsy, psp, and, corticobasal, syndrome, cbs, psp, predominantly, involves, rigidity, early, falls, bulbar, symptoms, and, vertical, gaze, restriction, it, can, be, associated, with, frontotemporal, dementia, symptoms, cbs, involves, asymmetric, parkinsonism, dystonia, alien, limb, and, myoclonic, jerking, presentation, timelines, and, associated, symptoms, can, help, differentiate, similar, movement, disorders, from, idiopathic, parkinson, disease, vascular, parkinsonism, is, the, phenomenon, of, the, presence, of, parkinson, s, disease, symptoms, combined, with, findings, of, vascular, events, such, as, a, cerebral, stroke, the, damaging, of, the, dopaminergic, pathways, is, similar, in, cause, for, both, vascular, parkinsonism, and, idiopathic, pd, and, so, present, with, similar, symptoms, differentiation, can, be, made, with, careful, bedside, examination, history, evaluation, and, imaging, parkinson, plus, syndrome, multiple, diseases, can, be, considered, part, of, the, parkinson, s, plus, group, including, corticobasal, syndrome, multiple, system, atrophy, progressive, supranuclear, palsy, and, dementia, with, lewy, bodies, differential, diagnosis, can, be, narrowed, down, with, careful, history, and, physical, exam, especially, focused, on, the, sequential, onset, of, specific, symptoms, progression, of, the, disease, and, response, to, treatment, some, key, symptoms, as, of, 2024, no, disease, modifying, therapies, exist, that, reverse, or, slow, neurodegeneration, processes, respectively, termed, neurorestoration, and, neuroprotection, however, several, factors, have, been, found, to, be, associated, with, a, decreased, risk, the, identification, and, mechanistic, analysis, of, these, factors, may, guide, the, development, of, new, therapies, exercise, one, of, the, most, common, recommendations, to, prevent, or, delay, parkinson, s, may, exert, a, neuroprotective, effect, in, animal, studies, investigating, the, cellular, basis, exercise, has, been, found, to, increase, neurotrophic, growth, factor, expression, and, to, reduce, alpha, synuclein, expression, neuroinflammation, and, mitochondrial, dysfunction, tobacco, use, and, smoking, is, strongly, associated, with, a, decreased, risk, reducing, the, chance, of, developing, pd, by, 40, 60, various, tobacco, and, smoke, components, have, been, hypothesized, to, be, neuroprotective, including, nicotine, carbon, monoxide, and, monoamine, oxidase, b, inhibitors, consumption, of, coffee, tea, or, caffeine, is, also, strongly, associated, with, neuroprotection, in, laboratory, models, caffeine, has, been, shown, to, be, neuroprotective, due, to, its, antagonistic, interaction, with, the, adenosine, a, 2a, receptor, which, modulates, dopaminergic, signaling, synaptic, plasticity, synapse, formation, and, inflammation, prescribed, adrenergic, antagonists, like, terazosin, may, also, reduce, risk, although, findings, have, varied, usage, of, nonsteroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, nsaids, like, ibuprofen, may, be, neuroprotective, calcium, channel, blockers, ccb, may, also, have, a, protective, effect, with, a, 22, risk, decrease, found, in, a, 2024, meta, analysis, of, almost, 3, million, ccb, users, higher, blood, concentrations, of, urate, a, potent, antioxidant, has, been, proposed, to, be, neuroprotective, animal, and, cell, studies, have, shown, that, urate, can, prevent, dopaminergic, neurodegeneration, although, longitudinal, studies, observe, a, slight, decrease, in, pd, risk, among, those, who, consume, alcohol, possibly, due, to, alcohol, s, urate, increasing, effect, alcohol, abuse, may, increase, risk, despite, ongoing, research, efforts, parkinson, s, disease, has, no, known, cure, patients, are, typically, managed, by, a, holistic, approach, that, combines, lifestyle, modifications, with, physical, therapy, certain, medications, may, also, be, used, to, provide, symptomatic, relief, and, improve, the, patient, s, quality, of, life, the, medications, used, in, parkinson, s, disease, work, by, either, increasing, endogenous, dopamine, levels, or, by, directly, mimicking, dopamine, s, effect, on, the, patient, s, brain, levodopa, l, dopa, is, the, most, effective, for, motor, symptoms, and, is, often, combined, with, a, dopa, decarboxylase, inhibitor, such, as, carbidopa, or, benserazide, other, agents, include, comt, inhibitors, dopamine, agonists, and, mao, b, inhibitors, the, patient, s, age, at, disease, onset, as, well, as, the, stage, of, the, disease, often, help, determine, which, of, the, aforementioned, drug, groups, is, most, effective, braak, staging, classifies, the, degree, of, pathology, in, patients, with, parkinson, s, disease, into, six, stages, that, correlate, with, early, middle, and, late, presentations, of, the, disease, treatment, in, the, first, stage, aims, for, an, optimal, trade, off, between, symptom, control, and, medication, side, effects, for, example, the, administration, of, levodopa, in, this, stage, may, be, delayed, in, favor, of, other, agents, such, as, mao, b, inhibitors, and, dopamine, agonists, due, to, its, notable, risk, of, complications, however, levodopa, related, dyskinesias, still, correlate, more, strongly, with, the, duration, and, severity, of, the, disease, than, the, duration, of, levodopa, treatment, a, careful, consideration, of, the, risks, and, benefits, of, starting, treatment, is, crucial, to, optimize, patient, outcomes, in, the, middle, stages, of, parkinson, s, disease, the, primary, aim, is, to, reduce, patient, symptoms, episodes, of, medication, overuse, or, any, sudden, withdrawals, from, medication, must, be, promptly, managed, if, medications, prove, ineffective, surgery, such, as, deep, brain, stimulation, or, high, intensity, focused, ultrasound, subcutaneous, waking, day, apomorphine, infusion, and, enteral, dopa, pumps, may, be, useful, late, stage, parkinson, s, disease, presents, challenges, requiring, a, variety, of, treatments, including, those, for, psychiatric, symptoms, particularly, depression, orthostatic, hypotension, bladder, dysfunction, and, erectile, dysfunction, in, the, final, stages, of, the, disease, palliative, care, is, provided, to, improve, a, person, s, quality, of, life, a, 2020, cochrane, review, found, no, certain, evidence, that, cognitive, training, is, beneficial, for, people, with, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, or, mild, cognitive, impairment, the, findings, are, based, on, low, certainty, evidence, of, seven, studies, no, standard, treatment, for, pd, associated, anxiety, exists, levodopa, is, usually, the, first, drug, of, choice, when, treating, parkinson, s, disease, and, has, been, the, most, widely, used, pd, treatment, since, the, 1980s, the, motor, symptoms, of, pd, are, the, result, of, reduced, dopamine, production, in, the, brain, s, basal, ganglia, dopamine, fails, to, cross, the, blood, brain, barrier, so, it, cannot, be, taken, as, a, medicine, to, boost, the, brain, s, depleted, levels, of, dopamine, a, precursor, of, dopamine, levodopa, can, pass, through, to, the, brain, where, it, is, readily, converted, to, dopamine, administration, of, levodopa, temporarily, diminishes, the, motor, symptoms, of, pd, only, 5, 10, of, levodopa, crosses, the, blood, brain, barrier, much, of, the, remainder, is, metabolized, to, dopamine, elsewhere, in, the, body, causing, a, variety, of, side, effects, including, nausea, vomiting, and, orthostatic, hypotension, carbidopa, and, benserazide, are, dopa, decarboxylase, inhibitors, that, fail, to, cross, the, blood, brain, barrier, and, inhibit, the, conversion, of, levodopa, to, dopamine, outside, the, brain, reducing, side, effects, and, improving, the, availability, of, levodopa, for, passage, into, the, brain, one, of, these, drugs, is, usually, taken, along, with, levodopa, and, is, available, combined, with, levodopa, in, the, same, pill, prolonged, use, of, levodopa, is, associated, with, the, development, of, complications, such, as, involuntary, movements, dyskinesias, and, fluctuations, in, the, impact, of, the, medication, when, fluctuations, occur, a, person, can, cycle, through, phases, with, good, response, to, medication, and, reduced, pd, symptoms, on, state, and, phases, with, poor, response, to, medication, and, increased, pd, symptoms, off, state, using, lower, doses, of, levodopa, may, reduce, the, risk, and, severity, of, these, levodopa, induced, complications, a, former, strategy, called, drug, holidays, to, reduce, levodopa, related, dyskinesia, and, fluctuations, was, to, withdraw, levodopa, medication, for, some, time, which, can, bring, on, dangerous, side, effects, such, as, neuroleptic, malignant, syndrome, and, is, discouraged, most, people, with, pd, eventually, need, levodopa, and, later, develop, levodopa, induced, fluctuations, and, dyskinesias, adverse, effects, of, levodopa, including, dyskinesias, may, mistakenly, influence, people, affected, by, the, disease, and, sometimes, their, healthcare, professionals, to, delay, treatment, which, reduces, potential, for, optimal, results, levodopa, is, available, in, oral, inhalation, and, infusion, form, inhaled, levodopa, can, be, used, when, oral, levodopa, therapy, has, reached, a, point, where, off, periods, have, increased, in, length, during, the, course, of, pd, affected, people, can, experience, a, wearing, off, phenomenon, where, a, recurrence, of, symptoms, occurs, after, a, dose, of, levodopa, but, right, before, their, next, dose, catechol, o, methyltransferase, comt, is, a, protein, that, degrades, levodopa, before, it, can, cross, the, blood, brain, barrier, and, comt, inhibitors, allow, for, more, levodopa, to, cross, they, are, normally, used, in, the, management, of, later, symptoms, but, can, be, used, in, conjunction, with, levodopa, carbidopa, when, a, person, is, experiencing, the, wearing, off, phenomenon, with, their, motor, symptoms, three, comt, inhibitors, are, used, to, treat, adults, with, pd, and, end, of, dose, motor, fluctuations, opicapone, entacapone, and, tolcapone, tolcapone, has, been, available, for, but, its, usefulness, is, limited, by, possible, liver, damage, complications, requiring, liver, function, monitoring, entacapone, and, opicapone, cause, little, alteration, to, liver, function, licensed, preparations, of, entacapone, contain, entacapone, alone, or, in, combination, with, carbidopa, and, levodopa, opicapone, is, a, once, daily, comt, inhibitor, dopamine, agonists, that, bind, to, dopamine, receptors, in, the, brain, have, similar, effects, to, levodopa, these, were, initially, used, as, a, complementary, therapy, to, levodopa, for, individuals, experiencing, levodopa, complications, on, off, fluctuations, and, dyskinesias, they, are, mainly, used, on, their, own, as, first, therapy, for, the, motor, symptoms, of, pd, with, the, aim, of, delaying, the, initiation, of, levodopa, therapy, thus, delaying, the, onset, of, levodopa, s, complications, dopamine, agonists, include, bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine, and, lisuride, though, dopamine, agonists, are, less, effective, than, levodopa, at, controlling, pd, motor, symptoms, they, are, effective, enough, to, manage, these, symptoms, in, the, first, years, of, treatment, dyskinesias, due, to, dopamine, agonists, are, rare, in, younger, people, who, have, pd, but, along, with, other, complications, become, more, common, with, older, age, at, onset, thus, dopamine, agonists, are, the, preferred, initial, treatment, for, younger, onset, pd, and, levodopa, is, preferred, for, older, onset, pd, dopamine, agonists, produce, side, effects, including, drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and, constipation, side, effects, appear, with, minimal, clinically, effective, doses, giving, the, physician, reason, to, search, for, a, different, drug, agonists, have, been, related, to, impulse, control, disorders, such, as, increased, sexual, activity, eating, gambling, and, shopping, more, strongly, than, other, antiparkinson, medications, apomorphine, a, dopamine, agonist, may, be, used, to, reduce, off, periods, and, dyskinesia, in, late, pd, it, is, administered, only, by, intermittent, injections, or, continuous, subcutaneous, infusions, secondary, effects, such, as, confusion, and, hallucinations, are, common, individuals, receiving, apomorphine, treatment, should, be, closely, monitored, two, dopamine, agonists, administered, through, skin, patches, lisuride, and, rotigotine, are, useful, for, people, in, the, initial, stages, and, possibly, to, control, off, states, in, those, in, advanced, states, due, to, an, increased, risk, of, cardiac, fibrosis, with, ergot, derived, dopamine, agonists, bromocriptine, cabergoline, dihydroergocryptine, lisuride, and, pergolide, they, should, only, be, considered, for, adjunct, therapy, to, levodopa, mao, b, inhibitors, safinamide, selegiline, and, rasagiline, increase, the, amount, of, dopamine, in, the, basal, ganglia, by, inhibiting, the, activity, of, monoamine, oxidase, b, an, enzyme, that, breaks, down, dopamine, they, have, been, found, to, help, alleviate, motor, symptoms, when, used, as, monotherapy, on, their, own, when, used, in, conjunction, with, levodopa, time, spent, in, the, off, phase, is, reduced, selegiline, has, been, shown, to, delay, the, need, for, beginning, levodopa, suggesting, that, it, might, be, neuroprotective, and, slow, the, progression, of, the, disease, an, initial, study, indicated, that, selegiline, in, combination, with, levodopa, increased, the, risk, of, death, but, this, has, been, refuted, common, side, effects, are, nausea, dizziness, insomnia, sleepiness, and, in, selegiline, and, rasagiline, orthostatic, hypotension, mao, bs, are, known, to, increase, serotonin, and, cause, a, potentially, dangerous, condition, known, as, serotonin, syndrome, other, drugs, such, as, amantadine, may, be, useful, as, treatment, of, motor, symptoms, but, evidence, for, use, is, lacking, anticholinergics, should, not, be, used, for, dyskinesia, or, motor, fluctuations, but, may, be, considered, topically, for, drooling, a, diverse, range, of, symptoms, beyond, those, related, to, motor, function, can, be, treated, pharmaceutically, examples, are, the, use, of, quetiapine, or, clozapine, for, psychosis, cholinesterase, inhibitors, or, memantine, for, dementia, and, modafinil, for, excessive, daytime, sleepiness, in, 2016, pimavanserin, was, approved, for, the, management, of, pd, psychosis, doxepin, and, rasagline, may, reduce, physical, fatigue, in, pd, treating, motor, symptoms, with, surgery, was, once, a, common, practice, but, the, discovery, of, levodopa, has, decreased, the, amount, of, procedures, studies, have, led, to, great, improvements, in, surgical, techniques, so, surgery, can, be, used, in, people, with, advanced, pd, for, whom, drug, therapy, is, no, longer, sufficient, surgery, for, pd, can, be, divided, in, two, main, groups, lesional, and, deep, brain, stimulation, dbs, target, areas, for, dbs, or, lesions, include, the, thalamus, globus, pallidus, or, subthalamic, nucleus, dbs, involves, the, implantation, of, a, medical, device, called, a, neurostimulator, which, sends, electrical, impulses, to, specific, parts, of, the, brain, dbs, is, recommended, for, people, who, have, pd, with, motor, fluctuations, and, tremor, inadequately, controlled, by, medication, or, to, those, who, are, intolerant, to, medication, lacking, severe, neuropsychiatric, problems, other, less, common, surgical, therapies, involve, intentional, formation, of, lesions, to, suppress, overactivity, of, specific, subcortical, areas, for, example, pallidotomy, involves, surgical, destruction, of, the, globus, pallidus, to, control, dyskinesia, four, areas, of, the, brain, have, been, treated, with, neural, stimulators, in, pd, these, are, the, globus, pallidus, interna, thalamus, subthalamic, nucleus, and, pedunculopontine, nucleus, dbs, of, the, globus, pallidus, interna, improves, motor, function, while, dbs, of, the, thalamic, dbs, improves, tremor, but, has, little, impact, on, bradykinesia, or, rigidity, dbs, of, the, subthalamic, nucleus, is, usually, avoided, if, a, history, of, depression, or, neurocognitive, impairment, is, present, dbs, of, the, subthalamic, nucleus, is, associated, with, a, reduction, in, medication, pedunculopontine, nucleus, dbs, remains, experimental, at, present, generally, dbs, is, associated, with, 30, 60, improvement, in, motor, score, evaluations, exercise, programs, are, recommended, in, people, with, pd, and, recent, reviews, 2024, have, demonstrated, their, efficacy, some, evidence, shows, that, speech, or, mobility, problems, can, improve, with, rehabilitation, although, studies, are, scarce, and, of, low, quality, regular, physical, exercise, with, or, without, physical, therapy, can, be, beneficial, to, maintain, and, improve, mobility, flexibility, strength, gait, speed, and, quality, of, life, when, an, exercise, program, is, performed, under, the, supervision, of, a, physiotherapist, more, improvements, occur, in, motor, symptoms, mental, and, emotional, functions, daily, living, activities, and, quality, of, life, compared, with, a, self, supervised, exercise, program, at, home, clinical, exercises, may, be, an, effective, intervention, targeting, overall, well, being, of, individuals, with, parkinson, s, improvement, in, motor, function, and, depression, may, happen, in, improving, flexibility, and, range, of, motion, for, people, experiencing, rigidity, generalized, relaxation, techniques, such, as, gentle, rocking, have, been, found, to, decrease, excessive, muscle, tension, other, effective, techniques, to, promote, relaxation, include, slow, rotational, movements, of, the, extremities, and, trunk, rhythmic, initiation, diaphragmatic, breathing, and, meditation, techniques, as, for, gait, and, addressing, the, challenges, associated, with, the, disease, such, as, hypokinesia, shuffling, and, decreased, arm, swing, physiotherapists, have, a, variety, of, strategies, to, improve, functional, mobility, and, safety, areas, of, interest, concerning, gait, during, rehabilitation, programs, focus, on, improving, gait, speed, the, base, of, support, stride, length, and, trunk, and, arm, swing, movement, strategies, include, using, assistive, equipment, pole, walking, and, treadmill, walking, verbal, cueing, manual, visual, and, auditory, exercises, marching, and, pnf, patterns, and, altering, environments, surfaces, inputs, open, vs, closed, strengthening, exercises, have, shown, improvements, in, strength, and, motor, function, for, people, with, primary, muscular, weakness, and, weakness, related, to, inactivity, with, mild, to, moderate, pd, but, reports, show, an, interaction, between, strength, and, the, time, the, medications, were, taken, therefore, people, with, pd, should, perform, exercises, 45, minutes, to, one, hour, after, medications, when, they, are, capable, deep, diaphragmatic, breathing, exercises, are, beneficial, in, improving, chest, wall, mobility, and, vital, capacity, decreased, by, a, forward, flexed, posture, and, respiratory, dysfunctions, in, advanced, pd, exercise, may, improve, constipation, whether, exercise, reduces, physical, fatigue, in, pd, remains, unclear, strength, training, exercise, has, been, shown, to, increase, manual, dexterity, in, people, with, pd, after, exercising, with, manual, putty, improvements, in, both, manual, dexterity, and, strength, can, have, a, favorable, impact, on, people, with, parkinson, s, disease, fostering, increased, independence, in, daily, activities, that, require, grasping, objects, the, lee, silverman, voice, treatment, lsvt, is, one, of, the, most, widely, practiced, treatments, for, speech, disorders, associated, with, pd, speech, therapy, and, specifically, lsvt, may, improve, speech, occupational, therapy, ot, aims, to, promote, health, and, quality, of, life, by, helping, people, with, the, disease, to, participate, in, a, large, percentage, of, their, daily, living, activities, few, studies, have, been, conducted, on, the, effectiveness, of, ot, and, their, quality, is, poor, although, with, some, indication, that, it, may, improve, motor, skills, and, quality, of, life, for, the, duration, of, the, therapy, the, goal, of, palliative, care, is, to, improve, quality, of, life, for, both, the, patient, and, family, by, providing, relief, from, the, symptoms, and, stress, of, illnesses, as, parkinson, s, is, uncurable, treatments, focus, on, slowing, decline, and, improving, quality, of, life, and, are, therefore, palliative, palliative, care, should, be, involved, earlier, rather, than, later, in, the, disease, course, palliative, care, specialists, can, help, with, physical, symptoms, emotional, factors, such, as, loss, of, function, and, jobs, depression, fear, and, existential, concerns, along, with, offering, emotional, support, to, both, the, affected, person, and, family, palliative, care, addresses, goals, of, care, people, with, pd, may, have, difficult, decisions, to, make, as, the, disease, progresses, such, as, wishes, for, feeding, tube, noninvasive, ventilator, or, tracheostomy, wishes, for, or, against, cardiopulmonary, resuscitation, and, when, to, use, hospice, care, palliative, care, team, members, can, help, answer, questions, and, guide, people, with, pd, on, these, complex, and, emotional, topics, to, help, them, make, decisions, based, on, values, muscles, and, nerves, that, control, the, digestive, process, may, be, affected, by, pd, resulting, in, constipation, and, gastroparesis, prolonged, emptying, of, stomach, contents, a, balanced, diet, based, on, periodical, nutritional, assessments, is, recommended, and, should, be, designed, to, avoid, weight, loss, or, gain, and, minimize, the, consequences, of, gastrointestinal, dysfunction, as, the, disease, advances, swallowing, difficulties, dysphagia, may, appear, using, thickening, agents, for, liquid, intake, and, an, upright, posture, when, eating, may, be, useful, both, measures, reduce, the, risk, of, choking, gastrostomy, can, be, used, to, deliver, food, directly, into, the, stomach, levodopa, and, proteins, use, the, same, transportation, system, in, the, intestine, and, the, blood, brain, barrier, thereby, competing, for, access, taking, them, together, results, in, reduced, effectiveness, of, the, drug, therefore, when, levodopa, is, introduced, excessive, protein, consumption, is, discouraged, in, favour, of, a, well, balanced, mediterranean, diet, in, advanced, stages, additional, intake, of, low, protein, products, such, as, bread, or, pasta, is, recommended, for, similar, reasons, to, minimize, interaction, with, proteins, levodopa, should, be, taken, 30, minutes, before, meals, at, the, same, time, regimens, for, pd, restrict, proteins, during, breakfast, and, lunch, allowing, protein, intake, in, the, evening, pd, invariably, progresses, with, time, a, severity, rating, method, known, as, the, unified, parkinson, s, disease, rating, scale, updrs, is, the, most, commonly, used, metric, for, a, clinical, study, a, modified, version, known, as, the, mds, updrs, is, also, used, an, older, scaling, method, known, as, the, hoehn, and, yahr, scale, originally, published, in, 1967, and, a, similar, scale, known, as, the, modified, hoehn, and, yahr, scale, have, been, used, the, hoehn, and, yahr, scale, defines, five, basic, stages, of, progression, motor, symptoms, may, advance, aggressively, in, the, early, stages, of, the, disease, and, more, slowly, later, untreated, individuals, are, expected, to, lose, independent, ambulation, after, an, average, of, eight, years, and, be, bedridden, after, 10, years, medication, has, improved, the, prognosis, of, motor, symptoms, in, people, taking, levodopa, the, progression, time, of, symptoms, to, a, stage, of, high, dependency, from, caregivers, may, be, over, 15, years, two, distinct, subtypes, of, pd, progression, have, been, described, and, were, validated, in, several, pd, cohorts, first, a, fast, progressing, pd, subtype, characterized, by, a, more, rapid, progression, of, cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and, autonomic, symptoms, higher, gait, impairment, increased, mortality, and, a, faster, neurodegeneration, in, the, substantia, nigra, second, a, slow, progressing, pd, subtype, with, milder, disease, progression, and, lower, mortality, predicting, what, course, the, disease, will, take, for, a, given, individual, is, difficult, higher, age, earlier, onset, of, rbd, symptoms, lower, education, and, less, asymmetry, of, pd, motor, symptoms, are, associated, with, a, faster, disease, progression, the, rate, of, motor, decline, is, greater, in, those, with, less, impairment, at, the, time, of, diagnosis, while, cognitive, impairment, is, more, frequent, in, those, who, are, over, 70, years, of, age, at, symptom, onset, no, hard, correlation, between, pd, progression, and, pd, disability, as, a, whole, has, been, found, as, of, 2023, however, initial, pd, disability, often, mainly, concerns, the, motor, symptoms, whereas, in, later, stages, it, is, often, mainly, related, to, the, non, motor, symptoms, of, the, disease, therapies, exist, that, can, improve, or, alleviate, these, latter, symptoms, to, some, extent, as, the, disease, advances, disability, is, more, related, to, motor, symptoms, that, are, uncontrollable, by, medication, such, as, dysphagia, dysarthria, and, problems, with, gait, or, balance, and, to, levodopa, induced, complications, which, appear, in, up, to, 50, of, individuals, after, five, years, of, levodopa, usage, finally, after, ten, years, most, people, with, the, disease, have, autonomic, disturbances, sleep, problems, mood, alterations, and, cognitive, decline, these, symptoms, especially, cognitive, decline, greatly, increase, disability, the, life, expectancy, of, people, with, pd, is, reduced, mortality, ratios, are, around, twice, those, of, unaffected, people, cognitive, decline, and, dementia, old, age, at, onset, a, more, advanced, disease, state, and, presence, of, swallowing, problems, are, all, mortality, risk, factors, a, disease, pattern, mainly, characterized, by, tremor, as, opposed, to, rigidity, though, predicts, an, improved, survival, aspiration, pneumonia, is, the, leading, cause, of, death, and, twice, as, common, in, individuals, with, pd, as, in, the, healthy, population, in, 2016, pd, resulted, in, about, 211, 000, deaths, globally, an, increase, of, 161, since, 1990, the, overall, death, rate, increased, by, 19, to, 1, 81, per, 100, 000, people, during, that, time, a, person, with, pd, has, two, to, six, times, the, risk, of, dementia, compared, with, the, general, population, up, to, 78, of, people, with, pd, have, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, dementia, is, associated, with, a, reduced, quality, of, life, in, people, with, pd, and, their, caregivers, increased, mortality, and, a, higher, probability, of, needing, nursing, home, care, as, of, 2024, parkinson, s, is, the, second, most, common, neurodegenerative, disease, and, the, fastest, growing, in, total, number, of, cases, as, of, 2023, global, prevalence, was, estimated, to, be, 1, 51, per, 1000, although, it, is, around, 40, more, common, in, men, age, is, the, dominant, predeterminant, of, parkinson, s, consequently, as, global, life, expectancy, has, increased, parkinson, s, disease, prevalence, has, also, risen, with, an, estimated, increase, in, cases, by, 74, from, 1990, to, 2016, the, total, number, is, predicted, to, rise, to, over, 12, million, patients, by, 2040, some, have, labeled, this, a, pandemic, this, increase, may, be, due, to, a, number, of, global, factors, including, prolonged, life, expectancy, increased, industrialisation, and, decreased, smoking, although, genetics, is, the, sole, factor, in, a, minority, of, cases, most, cases, of, parkinson, s, are, likely, a, result, of, gene, environment, interactions, concordance, studies, with, twins, have, found, parkinson, s, heritability, to, be, just, 30, the, influence, of, multiple, genetic, and, environmental, factors, complicates, epidemiological, efforts, relative, to, europe, and, north, america, disease, prevalence, is, lower, in, africa, especially, sub, saharan, africa, but, similar, in, latin, america, although, china, is, predicted, to, have, nearly, half, of, the, global, parkinson, s, population, by, 2030, estimates, of, prevalence, in, asia, have, varied, potential, explanations, for, these, geographic, differences, include, genetic, variation, environmental, factors, health, care, access, and, life, expectancy, although, pd, incidence, and, prevalence, may, vary, by, race, and, ethnicity, significant, disparities, in, care, diagnosis, and, study, participation, limit, generalizability, and, lead, to, conflicting, results, within, the, united, states, high, rates, of, pd, have, been, identified, in, the, midwest, and, south, as, well, as, agricultural, regions, of, california, florida, pennsylvania, and, texas, collectively, termed, the, pd, belt, it, is, hypothesized, that, this, is, due, to, localized, environmental, factors, like, herbicides, pesticides, and, industrial, waste, early, sources, including, an, egyptian, papyrus, an, ayurvedic, medical, treatise, the, bible, and, galen, s, writings, describe, symptoms, resembling, those, of, pd, after, galen, no, references, unambiguously, related, to, pd, appear, until, the, 17th, century, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, franciscus, sylvius, hieronymus, david, gaubius, john, hunter, and, auguste, fran, ois, chomel, wrote, about, elements, of, the, disease, although, the, first, systematic, description, of, the, disease, is, attributed, to, james, parkinson, the, disease, itself, with, all, four, cardinal, signs, tremor, bradykinesia, rigor, and, postural, instability, was, described, in, 1690, by, ferenc, p, pai, p, riz, in, a, hungarian, medical, text, over, 120, years, before, the, classical, description, of, james, parkinson, however, as, it, was, published, in, hungarian, his, book, was, ignored, in, the, western, medical, literature, in, 1817, james, parkinson, published, his, essay, reporting, six, people, with, paralysis, agitans, an, essay, on, the, shaking, palsy, described, the, characteristic, resting, tremor, abnormal, posture, and, gait, paralysis, and, diminished, muscle, strength, and, the, way, that, the, disease, progresses, over, time, early, neurologists, who, made, further, additions, to, the, knowledge, of, the, disease, include, trousseau, gowers, kinnier, wilson, and, erb, and, jean, martin, charcot, whose, studies, between, 1868, and, 1881, increased, the, understanding, of, the, disease, among, other, advances, charcot, made, the, distinction, between, rigidity, weakness, and, bradykinesia, he, championed, the, renaming, of, the, disease, in, honor, of, james, parkinson, in, 1912, frederic, lewy, described, microscopic, particles, in, affected, brains, later, named, lewy, bodies, in, 1919, konstantin, tretiakoff, reported, that, the, substantia, nigra, was, the, main, cerebral, structure, affected, but, this, finding, was, rejected, until, it, was, confirmed, by, further, studies, published, by, rolf, hassler, in, 1938, the, underlying, biochemical, changes, in, the, brain, were, identified, in, the, 1950s, due, largely, to, the, work, of, arvid, carlsson, on, the, neurotransmitter, dopamine, and, oleh, hornykiewicz, on, its, role, on, pd, in, 1997, alpha, synuclein, was, found, to, be, the, main, component, of, lewy, bodies, by, spillantini, trojanowski, goedert, and, others, anticholinergics, and, surgery, lesioning, of, the, corticospinal, pathway, or, some, of, the, basal, ganglia, structures, were, the, only, treatments, until, the, arrival, of, levodopa, which, reduced, their, use, dramatically, levodopa, was, first, synthesized, in, 1911, by, casimir, funk, but, it, received, little, attention, until, the, mid, 20th, century, it, entered, clinical, practice, in, 1967, and, brought, about, a, revolution, in, the, management, of, pd, by, the, late, 1980s, deep, brain, stimulation, introduced, by, alim, louis, benabid, and, colleagues, at, grenoble, france, emerged, as, a, possible, treatment, an, illustration, of, advanced, parkinson, s, disease, by, william, richard, gowers, was, published, in, 1886, in, a, manual, of, diseases, of, the, nervous, system, based, on, 1879, photographs, attributed, to, albert, londe, a, new, image, was, created, in, 2020, to, represent, diversity, in, levels, of, severity, for, some, people, with, pd, masked, facial, expressions, and, difficulty, moderating, facial, expressions, of, emotion, or, recognizing, other, people, s, facial, expressions, can, impact, social, well, being, as, the, condition, progresses, tremor, other, motor, symptoms, difficulty, communicating, or, issues, with, mobility, may, interfere, with, social, engagement, causing, individuals, with, pd, to, feel, isolated, public, perception, and, awareness, of, pd, symptoms, such, as, shaking, hallucinating, slurring, speech, and, being, off, balance, is, lacking, in, some, countries, and, can, lead, to, stigma, the, costs, of, pd, to, society, are, high, in, 2007, the, largest, share, of, direct, cost, came, from, inpatient, care, and, nursing, homes, while, the, share, coming, from, medication, was, substantially, lower, indirect, costs, are, high, due, to, reduced, productivity, and, the, burden, on, caregivers, in, addition, to, economic, costs, pd, reduces, quality, of, life, of, those, with, the, disease, and, their, caregivers, a, study, based, on, 2017, data, estimated, the, us, economic, pd, burden, at, 51, 9, billion, including, direct, medical, costs, of, 25, 4, billion, and, 26, 5, billion, in, indirect, and, non, medical, costs, the, projected, total, economic, burden, surpasses, 79, billion, by, 2037, these, findings, highlight, the, need, for, interventions, to, reduce, pd, incidence, delay, disease, progression, and, alleviate, symptom, burden, that, may, reduce, the, future, economic, burden, of, pd, the, birthday, of, james, parkinson, 11, april, has, been, designated, as, world, parkinson, s, day, a, red, tulip, was, chosen, by, international, organizations, as, the, symbol, of, the, disease, in, 2005, it, represents, the, james, parkinson, tulip, cultivar, registered, in, 1981, by, a, dutch, horticulturalist, advocacy, organizations, include, the, national, parkinson, foundation, which, has, provided, more, than, 180, million, in, care, research, and, support, services, since, 1982, parkinson, s, disease, foundation, which, has, distributed, more, than, 115, million, for, research, and, nearly, 50, million, for, education, and, advocacy, programs, since, its, founding, in, 1957, by, william, black, the, american, parkinson, disease, association, founded, in, 1961, and, the, european, parkinson, s, disease, association, founded, in, 1992, in, the, 21st, century, the, diagnosis, of, parkinson, s, among, notable, figures, has, increased, the, public, s, understanding, of, the, disorder, actor, michael, j, fox, was, diagnosed, with, pd, at, 29, years, old, and, has, used, his, diagnosis, to, increase, awareness, of, the, disease, to, illustrate, the, effects, of, the, disease, fox, has, appeared, without, medication, in, television, roles, and, before, the, united, states, congress, the, michael, j, fox, foundation, which, he, founded, in, 2000, has, raised, over, 2, billion, for, parkinson, s, research, boxer, muhammad, ali, showed, signs, of, pd, when, he, was, 38, but, was, undiagnosed, until, he, was, 42, and, has, been, called, the, world, s, most, famous, parkinson, s, patient, whether, he, had, pd, or, parkinsonism, related, to, boxing, is, unresolved, cyclist, and, olympic, medalist, davis, phinney, diagnosed, with, parkinson, s, at, 40, started, the, davis, phinney, foundation, in, 2004, to, support, pd, research, deng, xiaoping, former, paramount, leader, of, china, had, advanced, parkinson, s, disease, at, the, time, of, his, suicide, in, 2014, robin, williams, the, american, actor, and, comedian, had, been, diagnosed, with, pd, but, his, autopsy, revealed, dementia, with, lewy, bodies, highlighting, difficulties, in, accurate, diagnosis, as, of, 2022, no, disease, modifying, drugs, drugs, that, target, the, causes, or, damage, are, approved, for, parkinson, s, so, this, is, a, major, focus, of, parkinson, s, research, active, research, directions, include, the, search, for, new, animal, models, of, the, disease, and, studies, of, the, potential, usefulness, of, gene, therapy, stem, cell, transplants, and, neuroprotective, agents, to, aid, in, earlier, diagnosis, research, criteria, for, identifying, prodromal, biomarkers, of, the, disease, have, been, established, gene, therapy, typically, involves, the, use, of, a, noninfectious, virus, to, shuttle, genetic, material, into, a, part, of, the, brain, approaches, have, involved, the, expression, of, growth, factors, to, prevent, damage, neurturin, a, gdnf, family, growth, factor, and, enzymes, such, as, glutamic, acid, decarboxylase, gad, the, enzyme, that, produces, gaba, tyrosine, hydroxylase, the, enzyme, that, produces, l, dopa, and, catechol, o, methyl, transferase, comt, the, enzyme, that, converts, l, dopa, to, dopamine, no, safety, concerns, have, been, reported, but, the, approaches, have, largely, failed, in, phase, two, clinical, trials, the, delivery, of, gad, showed, promise, in, phase, two, trials, in, 2011, but, while, effective, at, improving, motor, function, was, inferior, to, dbs, follow, up, studies, in, the, same, cohort, have, suggested, persistent, improvement, a, vaccine, that, primes, the, human, immune, system, to, destroy, alpha, synuclein, pd01a, entered, clinical, trials, and, a, phase, one, report, in, 2020, suggested, safety, and, tolerability, in, 2018, an, antibody, prx002, rg7935, showed, preliminary, safety, evidence, in, stage, i, trials, supporting, continuation, to, stage, ii, trials, in, contrast, to, other, neurodegenerative, disorders, many, parkinson, s, symptoms, can, be, attributed, to, the, loss, of, a, single, cell, type, mesencephalic, dopaminergic, da, neurons, consequently, da, neuron, regeneration, is, a, promising, therapeutic, approach, although, most, initial, research, sought, to, generate, da, neuron, precursor, cells, from, fetal, brain, tissue, pluripotent, stem, cells, particularly, induced, pluripotent, stem, cells, ipscs, have, become, an, increasingly, popular, tissue, source, both, fetal, and, ipsc, derived, da, neurons, have, been, transplanted, into, patients, in, clinical, trials, 1926, although, some, patients, see, improvements, the, results, are, highly, variable, adverse, effects, such, as, dyskinesia, arising, from, excess, dopamine, release, by, the, transplanted, tissues, have, also, been, observed, antagonists, of, adenosine, receptors, specifically, a, 2a, have, been, explored, for, parkinson, s, of, these, istradefylline, has, emerged, as, the, most, successful, medication, and, was, approved, for, medical, use, in, the, united, states, in, 2019, it, is, approved, as, an, add, on, treatment, to, the, levodopa, carbidopa, regime, lrrk2, kinase, inhibitors, are, also, of, interest, neurodegeneration, is, proposed, to, originate, in, the, brainstem, and, olfactory, bulb, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease
