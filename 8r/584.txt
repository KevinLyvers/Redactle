sometimes, called, marine, turtles, are, reptiles, of, the, order, testudines, and, of, the, suborder, cryptodira, the, seven, existing, species, of, sea, turtles, are, the, flatback, green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead, kemp, s, ridley, and, olive, ridley, six, of, the, seven, sea, turtle, species, all, but, the, flatback, are, present, in, u, s, waters, and, are, listed, as, endangered, and, or, threatened, under, the, endangered, species, act, all, but, the, flatback, turtle, are, listed, as, threatened, with, extinction, globally, on, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, the, flatback, turtle, is, found, only, in, the, waters, of, australia, papua, new, guinea, and, indonesia, sea, turtles, can, be, categorized, as, hard, shelled, cheloniid, or, leathery, shelled, dermochelyid, the, only, dermochelyid, species, of, sea, turtle, is, the, leatherback, for, each, of, the, seven, species, of, sea, turtles, females, and, males, are, the, same, size, as, adults, it, is, possible, to, tell, male, turtles, from, female, turtles, by, their, long, tails, with, a, cloacal, opening, near, the, tip, adult, female, sea, turtles, have, shorter, tails, with, a, cloacal, opening, near, the, base, hatchling, and, sub, adult, turtles, do, not, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, it, is, not, possible, to, determine, their, sex, by, looking, at, them, in, general, sea, turtles, have, a, more, fusiform, body, plan, than, their, terrestrial, or, freshwater, counterparts, this, tapering, at, both, ends, reduces, volume, and, means, that, sea, turtles, cannot, retract, their, head, and, limbs, into, their, shells, for, protection, unlike, many, other, turtles, and, tortoises, however, the, streamlined, body, plan, reduces, friction, and, drag, in, the, water, and, allows, sea, turtles, to, swim, more, easily, and, swiftly, the, leatherback, sea, turtle, is, the, largest, sea, turtle, reaching, 1, 4, to, more, than, 1, 8, m, 4, 6, to, 5, 9, ft, in, length, and, weighing, between, 300, and, 640, kg, 661, to, 1, 411, lbs, other, sea, turtle, species, are, smaller, ranging, from, as, little, as, 60, cm, 2, ft, long, in, the, case, of, the, kemp, s, ridley, which, is, the, smallest, sea, turtle, species, to, 120, cm, 3, 9, ft, long, in, the, case, of, the, green, turtle, the, second, largest, the, skulls, of, sea, turtles, have, cheek, regions, that, are, enclosed, in, bone, although, this, condition, appears, to, resemble, that, found, in, the, earliest, known, fossil, reptiles, anapsids, it, is, possible, it, is, a, more, recently, evolved, trait, in, sea, turtles, placing, them, outside, the, anapsids, sea, turtles, along, with, other, turtles, and, tortoises, are, part, of, the, order, testudines, all, species, except, the, leatherback, sea, turtle, are, in, the, family, cheloniidae, the, superfamily, name, chelonioidea, and, family, name, cheloniidae, are, based, on, the, ancient, greek, word, for, tortoise, khel, n, the, leatherback, sea, turtle, is, the, only, extant, member, of, the, family, dermochelyidae, fossil, evidence, of, marine, turtles, goes, back, to, the, late, jurassic, 150, million, years, ago, with, genera, such, as, plesiochelys, from, europe, in, africa, the, first, marine, turtle, is, angolachelys, from, the, turonian, of, angola, a, lineage, of, unrelated, marine, testudines, the, pleurodire, side, necked, bothremydids, also, survived, well, into, the, cenozoic, other, pleurodires, are, also, thought, to, have, lived, at, sea, such, as, araripemys, and, extinct, pelomedusids, modern, sea, turtles, are, not, descended, from, more, than, one, of, the, groups, of, sea, going, turtles, that, have, existed, in, the, past, they, instead, constitute, a, single, radiation, that, became, distinct, from, all, other, turtles, at, least, 110, million, years, ago, their, closest, extant, relatives, are, in, fact, the, snapping, turtles, chelydridae, musk, turtles, kinosternidae, and, hickatee, dermatemyidae, of, the, americas, which, alongside, the, sea, turtles, constitute, the, clade, americhelydia, the, oldest, possible, representative, of, the, lineage, panchelonioidea, leading, to, modern, sea, turtles, was, possibly, desmatochelys, padillai, from, the, early, cretaceous, desmatochelys, was, a, protostegid, a, lineage, that, would, later, give, rise, to, some, very, large, species, but, went, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, presently, thought, to, be, outside, the, crown, group, that, contains, modern, sea, turtles, chelonioidea, the, exact, relationships, of, protostegids, to, modern, sea, turtles, are, still, debated, due, to, their, primitive, morphology, they, may, be, the, sister, group, to, the, chelonoidea, or, an, unrelated, turtle, lineage, that, convergently, evolved, similar, adaptations, the, earliest, true, sea, turtle, that, is, known, from, fossils, is, nichollsemys, from, the, early, cretaceous, albian, of, canada, in, 2022, the, giant, fossil, species, leviathanochelys, was, described, from, spain, this, species, inhabited, the, oceans, covering, europe, in, the, late, cretaceous, and, rivaled, the, concurrent, giant, protostegids, such, as, archelon, and, protostega, as, one, of, the, largest, turtles, to, ever, exist, unlike, the, protostegids, which, have, an, uncertain, relationship, to, modern, sea, turtles, leviathanochelys, is, thought, to, be, a, true, sea, turtle, of, the, superfamily, chelonioidea, sea, turtles, limbs, and, brains, have, evolved, to, adapt, to, their, diets, their, limbs, originally, evolved, for, locomotion, but, more, recently, evolved, to, aid, them, in, feeding, they, use, their, limbs, to, hold, swipe, and, forage, their, food, this, helps, them, eat, more, efficiently, below, is, a, cladogram, showing, the, phylogenetic, relationships, of, living, and, extinct, sea, turtles, in, the, chelonioidea, based, on, evers, et, al, 2019, toxochelys, protostegidae, corsochelys, dermochelyidae, nichollsemys, allopleuron, cheloniidae, argillochelys, procolpochelys, eochelone, puppigerus, ctenochelys, peritresius, cabindachelys, an, alternate, phylogeny, was, proposed, by, castillo, visa, et, al, 2022, toxochelyidae, protostegidae, corsochelys, eosphargis, dermochelys, nichollsemys, leviathanochelys,

turtles, can, be, found, in, all, oceans, except, for, the, polar, regions, the, flatback, sea, turtle, is, found, solely, on, the, northern, coast, of, australia, the, kemp, s, ridley, sea, turtle, is, found, solely, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, along, the, east, coast, of, the, united, states, sea, turtles, are, generally, found, in, the, waters, over, continental, shelves, during, the, first, three, to, five, years, of, life, sea, turtles, spend, most, of, their, time, in, the, pelagic, zone, floating, in, seaweed, mats, green, sea, turtles, in, particular, are, often, found, in, sargassum, mats, in, which, they, find, food, shelter, and, water, once, the, sea, turtle, has, reached, adulthood, it, moves, closer, to, the, shore, females, will, come, ashore, to, lay, their, eggs, on, sandy, beaches, during, the, nesting, season, sea, turtles, migrate, to, reach, their, spawning, beaches, which, are, limited, in, numbers, living, in, the, ocean, therefore, means, they, usually, migrate, over, large, distances, all, sea, turtles, have, large, body, sizes, which, is, helpful, for, moving, large, distances, large, body, sizes, also, offer, good, protection, against, the, large, predators, notably, sharks, found, in, the, ocean, in, 2020, diminished, human, activity, resulting, from, the, covid, 19, virus, caused, an, increase, in, sea, turtle, nesting, some, areas, in, thailand, saw, an, abnormally, high, number, of, nests, and, florida, experienced, a, similar, phenomenon, less, plastic, and, light, pollution, could, explain, these, observations, sea, turtles, are, thought, to, reach, sexual, maturity, from, about, 10, 20, years, old, depending, on, species, and, methodology, however, reliable, estimates, are, difficult, to, ascertain, mature, sea, turtles, may, migrate, thousands, of, miles, to, reach, breeding, sites, after, mating, at, sea, adult, female, sea, turtles, return, to, land, to, lay, their, eggs, different, species, of, sea, turtles, exhibit, various, levels, of, philopatry, in, the, extreme, case, females, return, to, the, same, beach, where, they, hatched, this, can, take, place, every, two, to, four, years, in, maturity, the, mature, nesting, female, hauls, herself, onto, the, beach, nearly, always, at, night, and, finds, suitable, sand, in, which, to, create, a, nest, using, her, hind, flippers, she, digs, a, circular, hole, 40, to, 50, centimetres, 16, to, 20, in, deep, after, the, hole, is, dug, the, female, then, starts, filling, the, nest, with, her, clutch, of, soft, shelled, eggs, depending, on, the, species, a, typical, clutch, may, contain, 50, 350, eggs, after, laying, she, re, fills, the, nest, with, sand, re, sculpting, and, smoothing, the, surface, and, then, camouflaging, the, nest, with, vegetation, until, it, is, relatively, undetectable, visually, she, may, also, dig, decoy, nests, the, whole, process, takes, 30, to, 60, minutes, she, then, returns, to, the, ocean, leaving, the, eggs, untended, females, may, lay, 1, 8, clutches, in, a, single, season, female, sea, turtles, alternate, between, mating, in, the, water, and, laying, their, eggs, on, land, most, sea, turtle, species, nest, individually, but, ridley, sea, turtles, come, ashore, en, masse, known, as, an, arribada, arrival, with, the, kemp, s, ridley, sea, turtle, this, occurs, during, the, day, sea, turtles, have, temperature, dependent, sex, determination, warmer, temperatures, produce, female, hatchlings, while, cooler, temperatures, produce, male, hatchlings, the, eggs, will, incubate, for, 50, 60, days, the, eggs, in, one, nest, hatch, together, over, a, short, period, of, time, the, baby, sea, turtles, break, free, of, the, egg, shell, dig, through, the, sand, and, crawl, into, the, sea, most, species, of, sea, turtles, hatch, at, night, however, the, kemp, s, ridley, sea, turtle, commonly, hatches, during, the, day, sea, turtle, nests, that, hatch, during, the, day, are, more, vulnerable, to, predators, and, may, encounter, more, human, activity, on, the, beach, larger, hatchlings, have, a, higher, probability, of, survival, than, smaller, individuals, which, can, be, explained, by, the, fact, that, larger, offspring, are, faster, and, thus, less, exposed, to, predation, predators, can, only, functionally, intake, so, much, larger, individuals, are, not, targeted, as, often, a, study, conducted, on, this, topic, shows, that, body, size, is, positively, correlated, with, speed, so, larger, baby, sea, turtles, are, exposed, to, predators, for, a, shorter, amount, of, time, the, fact, that, there, is, size, dependent, predation, on, chelonians, has, led, to, the, evolutionary, development, of, large, body, sizes, in, 1987, carr, discovered, that, the, young, of, green, and, loggerhead, sea, turtles, spent, a, great, deal, of, their, pelagic, lives, in, floating, sargassum, mats, within, these, mats, they, found, ample, shelter, and, food, in, the, absence, of, sargassum, young, sea, turtles, feed, in, the, vicinity, of, upwelling, fronts, in, 2007, reich, determined, that, green, sea, turtle, hatchlings, spend, the, first, three, to, five, years, of, their, lives, in, pelagic, waters, in, the, open, ocean, pre, juveniles, of, this, particular, species, were, found, to, feed, on, zooplankton, and, smaller, nekton, before, they, are, recruited, into, inshore, seagrass, meadows, as, obligate, herbivores, sea, turtles, maintain, an, internal, environment, that, is, hypotonic, to, the, ocean, to, maintain, hypotonicity, they, must, excrete, excess, salt, ions, like, other, marine, reptiles, sea, turtles, rely, on, a, specialized, gland, to, rid, the, body, of, excess, salt, because, reptilian, kidneys, cannot, produce, urine, with, a, higher, ion, concentration, than, sea, water, all, species, of, sea, turtles, have, a, lachrymal, gland, in, the, orbital, cavity, capable, of, producing, tears, with, a, higher, salt, concentration, than, sea, water, leatherback, sea, turtles, face, an, increased, osmotic, challenge, compared, to, other, species, of, sea, turtle, since, their, primary, prey, are, jellyfish, and, other, gelatinous, plankton, whose, fluids, have, the, same, concentration, of, salts, as, sea, water, the, much, larger, lachrymal, gland, found, in, leatherback, sea, turtles, may, have, evolved, to, cope, with, the, higher, intake, of, salts, from, their, prey, a, constant, output, of, concentrated, salty, tears, may, be, required, to, balance, the, input, of, salts, from, regular, feeding, even, considering, leatherback, sea, turtle, tears, can, have, a, salt, ion, concentration, almost, twice, that, of, other, species, of, sea, turtle, hatchlings, depend, on, drinking, sea, water, immediately, upon, entering, the, ocean, to, replenish, water, lost, during, the, hatching, process, salt, gland, functioning, begins, quickly, after, hatching, so, that, the, young, sea, turtles, can, establish, ion, and, water, balance, soon, after, entering, the, ocean, survival, and, physiological, performance, hinge, on, immediate, and, efficient, hydration, following, emergence, from, the, nest, all, sea, turtles, are, poikilotherms, however, leatherback, sea, turtles, family, dermochelyidae, are, able, to, maintain, a, body, temperature, 8, c, 14, f, warmer, than, the, ambient, water, by, thermoregulation, through, the, trait, of, gigantothermy, green, sea, turtles, in, the, relatively, cooler, pacific, are, known, to, haul, themselves, out, of, the, water, on, remote, islands, to, bask, in, the, sun, this, behavior, has, only, been, observed, in, a, few, locations, including, the, galapagos, hawaii, europa, island, and, parts, of, australia, sea, turtles, are, air, breathing, reptiles, that, have, lungs, so, they, regularly, surface, to, breathe, sea, turtles, spend, a, majority, of, their, time, underwater, so, they, must, be, able, to, hold, their, breath, for, long, periods, dive, duration, largely, depends, on, activity, a, foraging, sea, turtle, may, typically, spend, 5, 40, minutes, underwater, while, a, sleeping, sea, turtle, can, remain, underwater, for, 4, 7, hours, remarkably, sea, turtle, respiration, remains, aerobic, for, the, vast, majority, of, voluntary, dive, time, when, a, sea, turtle, is, forcibly, submerged, e, g, entangled, in, a, trawl, net, its, diving, endurance, is, substantially, reduced, so, it, is, more, susceptible, to, drowning, when, surfacing, to, breathe, a, sea, turtle, can, quickly, refill, its, lungs, with, a, single, explosive, exhalation, and, rapid, inhalation, their, large, lungs, permit, rapid, exchange, of, oxygen, and, avoid, trapping, gases, during, deep, dives, cold, stunning, is, a, phenomenon, that, occurs, when, sea, turtles, enter, cold, ocean, water, 7, 10, c, 45, 50, f, which, causes, the, turtles, to, float, to, the, surface, and, therefore, makes, it, impossible, for, them, to, swim, gruber, and, sparks, 2015, have, observed, the, first, fluorescence, in, a, marine, tetrapod, four, limbed, vertebrates, sea, turtles, are, the, first, biofluorescent, reptile, found, in, the, wild, according, to, gruber, and, sparks, 2015, fluorescence, is, observed, in, an, increasing, number, of, marine, creatures, cnidarians, ctenophores, annelids, arthropods, and, chordates, and, is, now, also, considered, to, be, widespread, in, cartilaginous, and, ray, finned, fishes, the, two, marine, biologists, accidentally, made, the, observation, in, the, solomon, islands, on, a, hawksbill, sea, turtle, one, of, the, rarest, and, most, endangered, sea, turtle, species, in, the, ocean, during, a, night, dive, aimed, to, film, the, biofluorescence, emitted, by, small, sharks, and, coral, reefs, the, role, of, biofluorescence, in, marine, organisms, is, often, attributed, to, a, strategy, for, attracting, prey, or, perhaps, a, way, to, communicate, it, could, also, serve, as, a, way, of, defense, or, camouflage, for, the, sea, turtle, hiding, during, night, amongst, other, fluorescent, organisms, like, corals, fluorescent, corals, and, sea, creatures, are, best, observed, during, night, dives, with, a, blue, led, light, and, with, a, camera, equipped, with, an, orange, optical, filter, to, capture, only, the, fluorescence, light, below, the, surface, the, sensory, cues, available, for, navigation, change, dramatically, light, availability, decreases, quickly, with, depth, and, is, refracted, by, the, movement, of, water, when, present, celestial, cues, are, often, obscured, and, ocean, currents, cause, continuous, drift, most, sea, turtle, species, migrate, over, significant, distances, to, nesting, or, foraging, grounds, some, even, crossing, entire, ocean, basins, passive, drifting, within, major, current, systems, such, as, those, in, the, north, atlantic, gyre, can, result, in, ejection, well, outside, of, the, temperature, tolerance, range, of, a, given, species, causing, heat, stress, hypothermia, or, death, in, order, to, reliably, navigate, within, strong, gyre, currents, in, the, open, ocean, migrating, sea, turtles, possess, both, a, bicoordinate, magnetic, map, and, magnetic, compass, sense, using, a, form, of, navigation, termed, magnetoreception, specific, migratory, routes, have, been, shown, to, vary, between, individuals, making, the, possession, of, both, a, magnetic, map, and, compass, sense, advantageous, for, sea, turtles, a, bicoordinate, magnetic, map, gives, sea, turtles, the, ability, to, determine, their, position, relative, to, a, goal, with, both, latitudinal, and, longitudinal, information, and, requires, the, detection, and, interpretation, of, more, than, one, magnetic, parameter, going, in, opposite, directions, to, generate, such, as, magnetic, field, intensity, and, inclination, angle, a, magnetic, compass, sense, allows, sea, turtles, to, determine, and, maintain, a, specific, magnetic, heading, or, orientation, these, magnetic, senses, are, thought, to, be, inherited, as, hatchling, sea, turtles, swim, in, directions, that, would, keep, them, on, course, when, exposed, to, the, magnetic, field, signatures, of, various, locations, along, their, species, migratory, routes, natal, homing, behavior, is, well, described, in, sea, turtles, and, genetic, testing, of, turtle, populations, at, different, nesting, sites, has, shown, that, magnetic, field, is, a, more, reliable, indicator, of, genetic, similarity, than, physical, distance, between, sites, additionally, nesting, sites, have, been, recorded, to, drift, along, with, isoline, shifts, in, the, magnetic, field, magnetoreception, is, thought, to, be, the, primary, navigation, tool, used, by, nesting, sea, turtles, in, returning, to, natal, beaches, there, are, three, major, theories, explaining, natal, site, learning, inherited, magnetic, information, socially, facilitated, migration, and, geomagnetic, imprinting, some, support, has, been, found, for, geomagnetic, imprinting, including, successful, experiments, transplanting, populations, of, sea, turtles, by, relocating, them, prior, to, hatching, but, the, exact, mechanism, is, still, not, known, the, loggerhead, kemp, s, ridley, olive, ridley, and, hawksbill, sea, turtles, are, omnivorous, their, entire, life, omnivorous, turtles, may, eat, a, wide, variety, of, plant, and, animal, life, including, decapods, seagrasses, seaweed, sponges, mollusks, cnidarians, echinoderms, worms, and, fish, however, some, species, specialize, on, certain, prey, the, diet, of, green, sea, turtles, changes, with, age, juveniles, are, omnivorous, but, as, they, mature, they, become, exclusively, herbivorous, this, diet, shift, has, an, effect, on, the, green, sea, turtle, s, morphology, green, sea, turtles, have, a, serrated, jaw, that, is, used, to, eat, sea, grass, and, algae, leatherback, sea, turtles, feed, almost, exclusively, on, jellyfish, and, help, control, jellyfish, populations, hawksbill, sea, turtles, principally, eat, sponges, which, constitute, 70, 95, of, their, diets, in, the, caribbean, there, was, little, information, regarding, the, sea, turtle, s, larynx, sea, turtles, like, other, turtle, species, lack, an, epiglottis, to, cover, the, larynx, entrance, key, findings, from, an, experiment, reveal, the, following, in, regards, to, the, larynx, morphology, a, close, apposition, between, the, linguolaryngeal, cleft, s, smooth, mucosal, walls, and, the, laryngeal, folds, a, dorsal, part, of, the, glottis, the, glottal, mucosa, attached, to, the, arytenoid, cartilage, and, the, way, the, hyoid, sling, is, arranged, and, the, relationship, between, the, compressor, laryngis, muscle, and, cricoid, cartilage, the, glottal, opening, and, closing, mechanisms, have, been, examined, during, the, opening, stage, two, abductor, artytenoideae, muscles, swing, arytenoid, cartilages, and, the, glottis, walls, as, a, result, the, glottis, profile, is, transformed, from, a, slit, to, a, triangle, in, the, closing, stage, the, tongue, is, drawn, posteriorly, due, to, the, close, apposition, of, the, glottis, walls, and, linguolaryngeal, cleft, walls, and, hyoglossal, sling, contractions, sea, turtles, are, caught, worldwide, although, it, is, illegal, to, hunt, most, species, in, many, countries, a, great, deal, of, intentional, sea, turtle, harvests, worldwide, are, for, food, many, parts, of, the, world, have, long, considered, sea, turtles, to, be, fine, dining, in, england, during, the, 1700s, sea, turtles, were, consumed, as, a, delicacy, to, near, extinction, often, as, turtle, soup, ancient, chinese, texts, dating, to, the, 5th, century, b, c, e, describe, sea, turtles, as, exotic, delicacies, many, coastal, communities, around, the, world, depend, on, sea, turtles, as, a, source, of, protein, often, harvesting, several, sea, turtles, at, once, and, keeping, them, alive, on, their, backs, until, needed, coastal, peoples, gather, sea, turtle, eggs, for, consumption, to, a, much, lesser, extent, some, species, are, targeted, for, their, shells, tortoiseshell, a, traditional, decorative, ornamental, material, used, in, japan, and, china, comes, from, the, carapace, scutes, of, the, hawksbill, sea, turtle,

ecotourism, based, economy, tortuguero, is, considered, to, be, the, founding, location, of, sea, turtle, conservation, in, the, 1960s, the, cultural, demand, for, sea, turtle, meat, shells, and, eggs, was, quickly, killing, the, once, abundant, sea, turtle, populations, that, nested, on, the, beach, the, caribbean, conservation, corporation, began, working, with, villagers, to, promote, ecotourism, as, a, permanent, substitute, to, sea, turtle, hunting, sea, turtle, nesting, grounds, became, sustainable, tourists, love, to, come, and, visit, the, nesting, grounds, although, it, causes, a, lot, of, stress, to, the, sea, turtles, because, all, of, the, eggs, can, get, damaged, or, harmed, since, the, creation, of, a, sea, turtle, ecotourism, based, economy, tortugero, annually, houses, thousands, of, tourists, who, visit, the, protected, 35, kilometre, 22, mi, beach, that, hosts, sea, turtle, walks, and, nesting, grounds, walks, to, observe, the, nesting, sea, turtles, require, a, certified, guide, and, this, controls, and, minimises, disturbance, of, the, beaches, it, also, gives, the, locals, a, financial, interest, in, conservation, and, the, guides, now, defend, the, sea, turtles, from, threats, such, as, poaching, efforts, in, costa, rica, s, pacific, coast, are, facilitated, by, a, nonprofit, organization, sea, turtles, forever, thousands, of, people, are, involved, in, sea, turtle, walks, and, substantial, revenues, accrue, from, the, fees, paid, for, the, privilege, in, other, parts, of, the, world, where, sea, turtle, breeding, sites, are, threatened, by, human, activity, volunteers, often, patrol, beaches, as, a, part, of, conservation, activities, which, may, include, relocating, sea, turtle, eggs, to, hatcheries, or, assisting, hatching, sea, turtles, in, reaching, the, ocean, locations, in, which, such, efforts, exist, include, the, east, coast, of, india, s, o, tom, and, pr, ncipe, sham, wan, in, hong, kong, and, the, coast, of, florida, sea, turtles, play, key, roles, in, two, habitat, types, oceans, and, beaches, dunes, in, the, oceans, sea, turtles, especially, green, sea, turtles, are, among, the, very, few, creatures, manatees, are, another, that, eat, sea, grass, sea, grass, needs, to, be, constantly, cut, short, to, help, it, grow, across, the, sea, floor, sea, turtle, grazing, helps, maintain, the, health, of, the, sea, grass, beds, sea, grass, beds, provide, breeding, and, developmental, grounds, for, numerous, marine, animals, without, them, many, marine, species, humans, harvest, would, be, lost, as, would, the, lower, levels, of, the, food, chain, the, reactions, could, result, in, many, more, marine, species, eventually, becoming, endangered, or, extinct, sea, turtles, use, beaches, and, sand, dunes, as, to, lay, their, eggs, such, coastal, environments, are, nutrient, poor, and, depend, on, vegetation, to, protect, against, erosion, eggs, hatched, or, unhatched, and, hatchlings, that, fail, to, make, it, into, the, ocean, are, nutrient, sources, for, dune, vegetation, and, therefore, protecting, these, nesting, habitats, for, sea, turtles, forming, a, positive, feedback, loop, sea, turtles, also, maintain, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, yellow, tang, in, which, the, fish, will, eat, algae, growing, on, the, shell, of, a, sea, turtle, the, iucn, red, list, classifies, three, species, of, sea, turtle, as, either, endangered, or, critically, endangered, an, additional, three, species, are, classified, as, vulnerable, the, flatback, sea, turtle, is, considered, as, data, deficient, meaning, that, its, conservation, status, is, unclear, due, to, lack, of, data, all, species, of, sea, turtle, are, listed, in, cites, appendix, i, restricting, international, trade, of, sea, turtles, and, sea, turtle, products, however, the, usefulness, of, global, assessments, for, sea, turtles, has, been, questioned, particularly, due, to, the, presence, of, distinct, genetic, stocks, and, spatially, separated, regional, management, units, rmus, each, rmu, is, subject, to, a, unique, set, of, threats, that, generally, cross, jurisdictional, boundaries, resulting, in, some, sub, populations, of, the, same, species, showing, recovery, while, others, continue, to, decline, this, has, triggered, the, iucn, to, conduct, threat, assessments, at, the, sub, population, level, for, some, species, recently, these, new, assessments, have, highlighted, an, unexpected, mismatch, between, where, conservation, relevant, science, has, been, conducted, on, sea, turtles, and, where, there, is, the, greatest, need, for, conservation, for, example, as, at, august, 2017, about, 69, of, studies, using, stable, isotope, analysis, to, understand, the, foraging, distribution, of, sea, turtles, have, been, conducted, in, rmus, listed, as, least, concern, by, the, iucn, additionally, all, populations, of, sea, turtles, that, occur, in, united, states, waters, are, listed, as, threatened, or, endangered, by, the, us, endangered, species, act, esa, the, us, listing, status, of, the, loggerhead, sea, turtle, is, under, review, as, of, 2012, threatened, all, other, populations, threatened, nw, atlantic, s, atlantic, se, indo, pacific, sw, indian, populations, threatened, all, other, populations, the, esa, manages, sea, turtles, by, population, and, not, by, species, in, the, caribbean, researchers, are, having, some, success, in, assisting, a, comeback, in, september, 2007, corpus, christi, texas, wildlife, officials, found, 128, kemp, s, ridley, sea, turtle, nests, on, texas, beaches, a, record, number, including, 81, on, north, padre, island, padre, island, national, seashore, and, four, on, mustang, island, wildlife, officials, released, 10, 594, kemp, s, ridley, sea, turtle, hatchlings, along, the, texas, coast, in, recent, years, the, philippines, has, had, several, initiatives, dealing, with, the, issue, of, sea, turtle, conservation, in, 2007, the, province, of, batangas, declared, the, catching, and, eating, of, sea, turtles, locally, referred, to, as, pawikans, illegal, however, the, law, seems, to, have, had, little, effect, as, sea, turtle, eggs, are, still, in, demand, in, batangan, markets, in, september, 2007, several, chinese, poachers, were, apprehended, off, the, turtle, islands, in, the, country, s, southernmost, province, of, tawi, tawi, the, poachers, had, collected, more, than, a, hundred, sea, turtles, along, with, 10, 000, sea, turtle, eggs, evaluating, the, progress, of, conservation, programs, is, difficult, because, many, sea, turtle, populations, have, not, been, assessed, adequately, most, information, on, sea, turtle, populations, comes, from, counting, nests, on, beaches, but, this, does, not, provide, an, accurate, picture, of, the, whole, sea, turtle, population, a, 2010, united, states, national, research, council, report, concluded, that, more, detailed, information, on, sea, turtles, life, cycles, such, as, birth, rates, and, mortality, is, needed, nest, relocation, may, not, be, a, useful, conservation, technique, for, sea, turtles, in, one, study, on, the, freshwater, arrau, turtle, podocnemis, expansa, researchers, examined, the, effects, of, nest, relocation, they, discovered, that, clutches, of, this, freshwater, turtle, that, were, transplanted, to, a, new, location, had, higher, mortality, rates, and, more, morphological, abnormalities, compared, to, non, transplanted, clutches, however, in, a, study, of, loggerhead, sea, turtles, caretta, caretta, dellert, et, al, found, that, relocating, nests, at, risk, of, inundation, increased, the, success, of, eggs, and, hatchlings, and, decreased, the, risk, of, inundation, most, sea, turtle, mortality, happens, early, in, life, sea, turtles, usually, lay, around, 100, eggs, at, a, time, but, on, average, only, one, of, the, eggs, from, the, nest, will, survive, to, adulthood, raccoons, foxes, and, seabirds, may, raid, nests, or, hatchlings, may, be, eaten, within, minutes, of, hatching, as, they, make, their, initial, run, for, the, ocean, once, in, the, water, they, are, susceptible, to, seabirds, large, fish, and, even, other, sea, turtles, adult, sea, turtles, have, few, predators, large, aquatic, carnivores, such, as, sharks, and, crocodiles, are, their, biggest, threats, however, reports, of, terrestrial, predators, attacking, nesting, females, are, not, uncommon, jaguars, have, been, reported, to, smash, into, sea, turtle, shells, with, their, paws, and, scoop, out, the, flesh, fibropapillomatosis, disease, causes, tumors, in, sea, turtles, while, many, of, the, things, that, endanger, sea, turtles, are, natural, predators, increasingly, many, threats, to, the, sea, turtle, species, have, arrived, with, the, ever, growing, presence, of, humans, one, of, the, most, significant, and, contemporary, threats, to, sea, turtles, comes, from, bycatch, due, to, imprecise, fishing, methods, long, lining, has, been, identified, as, a, major, cause, of, accidental, sea, turtle, deaths, there, is, also, a, black, market, demand, for, tortoiseshell, for, both, decoration, and, supposed, health, benefits, sea, turtles, must, surface, to, breathe, caught, in, a, fisherman, s, net, they, are, unable, to, surface, and, thus, drown, in, early, 2007, almost, a, thousand, sea, turtles, were, killed, inadvertently, in, the, bay, of, bengal, over, the, course, of, a, few, months, after, netting, however, some, relatively, inexpensive, changes, to, fishing, techniques, such, as, slightly, larger, hooks, and, traps, from, which, sea, turtles, can, escape, can, dramatically, cut, the, mortality, rate, turtle, excluder, devices, teds, have, reduced, sea, turtle, bycatch, in, shrimp, nets, by, 97, percent, light, pollution, from, beach, development, is, a, threat, to, baby, sea, turtles, the, glow, from, city, sources, can, cause, them, to, head, into, traffic, instead, of, the, ocean, there, has, been, some, movement, to, protect, these, areas, on, the, east, coast, of, florida, parts, of, the, beach, known, to, harbor, sea, turtle, nests, are, protected, by, fences, conservationists, have, monitored, hatchings, relocating, lost, baby, sea, turtles, to, the, beach, hatchlings, find, their, way, to, the, ocean, by, crawling, towards, the, brightest, horizon, and, can, become, disoriented, along, the, coastline, lighting, restrictions, can, prevent, lights, from, shining, on, the, beach, and, confusing, hatchlings, sea, turtle, safe, lighting, uses, red, or, amber, led, light, invisible, to, sea, turtles, in, place, of, white, light, another, major, threat, to, sea, turtles, is, the, black, market, trade, in, eggs, and, meat, this, is, a, problem, throughout, the, world, but, especially, a, concern, in, china, the, philippines, india, indonesia, and, the, coastal, nations, of, latin, america, estimates, reach, as, high, as, 35, 000, sea, turtles, killed, a, year, in, mexico, and, the, same, number, in, nicaragua, conservationists, in, mexico, and, the, united, states, have, launched, don, t, eat, sea, turtle, campaigns, in, order, to, reduce, this, trade, in, sea, turtle, products, these, campaigns, have, involved, figures, such, as, dorismar, los, tigres, del, norte, and, man, sea, turtles, are, often, consumed, during, the, catholic, season, of, lent, even, though, they, are, reptiles, not, fish, consequently, conservation, organizations, have, written, letters, to, the, pope, asking, that, he, declare, sea, turtles, meat, another, danger, to, sea, turtles, comes, from, marine, debris, especially, plastics, which, may, be, mistaken, for, jellyfish, and, abandoned, fishing, nets, in, which, they, can, become, entangled, sea, turtles, in, all, types, are, being, endangered, by, the, way, humans, use, plastic, recycling, is, known, of, and, people, recycle, but, not, everyone, does, the, amount, of, plastic, in, the, oceans, and, beaches, is, growing, every, day, the, littering, of, plastic, is, 80, of, the, amount, when, turtles, hatch, from, their, eggs, on, the, beach, they, are, already, endangered, with, plastic, turtles, have, to, find, the, ocean, by, themselves, and, on, their, journey, from, land, to, sea, they, encounter, a, lot, of, plastic, some, even, get, trapped, in, the, plastic, and, die, from, lack, of, resources, and, from, the, sun, being, too, hot, sea, turtles, eat, plastic, bags, because, they, confuse, them, with, their, actual, diet, jellyfish, algae, and, other, components, the, consumption, of, plastic, is, different, for, every, breed, of, sea, turtle, but, when, they, ingest, the, plastic, it, can, clog, their, intestines, and, cause, internal, bleeding, which, will, eventually, kill, them, in, 2015, an, olive, ridley, sea, turtle, was, found, with, a, plastic, drinking, straw, lodged, inside, its, nose, the, video, of, nathan, j, robinson, has, helped, raise, considerable, awareness, about, the, threat, posed, by, plastic, pollution, to, sea, turtles, the, research, into, turtle, consumption, of, plastic, is, growing, a, laboratory, of, exeter, and, plymouth, marine, tested, 102, turtles, and, found, plastic, in, every, one, of, their, stomachs, the, researchers, found, more, than, 800, pieces, of, plastic, in, those, 102, turtles, that, was, 20, times, more, than, what, was, found, in, the, last, research, those, researchers, stated, that, the, most, common, things, found, were, cigarette, buds, tire, plastic, in, many, forms, and, fishing, material, the, chemicals, in, the, plastic, that, sea, life, eats, damages, their, internal, organs, and, can, also, clog, their, airway, the, chemicals, in, the, plastic, that, they, eat, is, also, a, leading, cause, of, the, death, of, the, turtles, if, the, turtles, are, close, to, laying, eggs, the, chemicals, that, they, ingested, from, the, plastic, can, seep, into, their, eggs, and, affect, their, offspring, it, is, unlikely, for, the, baby, sea, turtles, to, survive, with, those, chemicals, in, their, system, there, is, a, large, quantity, of, plastic, in, the, ocean, 80, of, which, comes, from, landfills, the, ratio, of, plankton, to, plastic, in, the, ocean, is, one, to, six, the, great, pacific, garbage, patch, is, a, swirl, of, garbage, in, the, pacific, ocean, that, is, 6, m, 20, ft, deep, and, contains, 3, 5, million, tons, of, garbage, this, is, also, known, as, the, plastic, island, climate, change, may, also, cause, a, threat, to, sea, turtles, since, sand, temperature, at, nesting, beaches, defines, the, sex, of, a, sea, turtle, while, developing, in, the, egg, there, is, concern, that, rising, temperatures, may, produce, too, many, females, however, more, research, is, needed, to, understand, how, climate, change, might, affect, sea, turtle, gender, distribution, and, what, other, possible, threats, it, may, pose, studies, have, shown, that, climate, change, in, the, world, is, making, sea, turtles, gender, change, the, study, that, was, in, january, 2018, current, biology, environmental, warning, and, feminization, of, one, of, the, largest, sea, turtle, populations, in, the, world, showed, how, baby, sea, turtles, were, being, born, female, a, lot, more, than, being, born, male, scientists, took, blood, samples, from, many, baby, sea, turtles, near, the, great, barrier, reef, prior, to, this, study, the, ratio, of, male, to, female, was, pretty, normal, there, was, a, little, more, female, than, there, was, male, but, it, was, enough, to, keep, reproduction, and, life, cycle, normal, the, study, showed, that, there, was, 99, more, female, sea, turtles, then, male, the, temperature, of, the, sand, has, a, big, impact, on, the, sex, of, the, sea, turtle, this, is, not, common, with, other, animals, but, it, is, with, sea, turtles, warmer, or, hot, sand, usually, makes, the, sea, turtle, female, and, the, cooler, the, sand, usually, makes, male, climate, change, has, made, the, temperatures, much, hotter, than, they, should, be, the, temperature, of, the, sand, gets, hotter, every, time, it, is, time, for, sea, turtles, to, lay, their, eggs, with, that, adaption, to, the, sand, should, occur, but, it, would, take, generations, for, them, to, adapt, to, that, one, temperature, it, would, be, hard, because, the, temperature, of, the, sand, is, always, changing, the, sand, temperature, is, not, the, only, thing, that, impacts, sea, turtles, the, rise, of, the, sea, levels, messes, with, their, memory, they, have, an, imprinted, map, in, their, memory, that, shows, where, they, usually, give, birth, and, go, after, they, do, with, the, rise, in, water, levels, that, map, is, getting, messed, up, and, is, hard, for, them, to, get, back, to, where, they, started, it, is, also, taking, away, their, beaches, that, they, lay, their, eggs, on, climate, change, also, has, an, impact, on, the, number, of, storms, and, the, severity, of, them, storms, can, wipe, out, the, sea, turtles, nesting, ground, and, take, out, the, eggs, that, already, laid, the, rising, level, of, water, is, also, a, way, for, the, nesting, grounds, to, disappear, sea, turtles, maps, and, their, nesting, grounds, getting, destroyed, is, harmful, to, them, that, is, because, with, their, maps, being, messed, up, and, not, being, able, to, lay, eggs, where, they, usually, do, makes, it, hard, for, them, to, find, a, new, place, to, nest, they, usually, stick, to, a, schedule, and, the, messing, up, of, a, schedule, messes, them, up, the, temperature, of, the, ocean, is, also, rising, this, impacts, their, diet, and, what, they, can, eat, coral, reefs, are, majorly, impacted, by, the, rising, temperatures, and, a, lot, of, sea, turtles, diet, is, coral, reefs, or, in, the, coral, reef, most, animals, that, live, in, coral, reefs, need, the, reefs, to, survive, with, the, reefs, dying, the, sea, life, around, it, also, does, impacting, many, animals, sea, turtles, are, very, vulnerable, to, oil, pollution, both, because, of, the, oil, s, tendency, to, linger, on, the, water, s, surface, and, because, oil, can, affect, them, at, every, stage, of, their, life, cycle, oil, can, poison, the, sea, turtles, upon, entering, their, digestive, system, sea, turtles, have, a, cycle, that, they, follow, from, birth, the, cycle, depends, on, the, sex, of, the, turtle, but, they, follow, it, all, the, way, through, life, they, start, by, hatching, on, the, beach, they, reach, the, water, then, move, out, to, find, food, they, then, start, their, breeding, migration, and, then, mate, with, another, turtle, for, females, they, make, their, way, to, the, beach, to, start, it, all, over, again, with, males, they, go, back, to, feeding, after, mating, and, doing, that, over, again, oil, spills, can, affect, this, cycle, majorly, if, the, female, was, to, go, and, lay, eggs, and, ingest, oil, the, chemicals, from, the, oil, can, get, passed, on, to, the, offspring, and, will, be, hard, for, them, to, survive, the, diet, of, the, sea, turtles, can, also, be, impacted, by, oil, if, the, things, that, they, eat, has, oil, on, it, or, has, ingested, oil, it, can, get, into, their, system, and, start, attacking, the, insides, of, the, turtle, injured, sea, turtles, are, rescued, and, rehabilitated, and, if, possible, released, back, to, the, ocean, by, professional, organizations, such, as, the, gumbo, limbo, nature, center, in, boca, raton, florida, the, karen, beasley, sea, turtle, rescue, and, rehabilitation, center, in, surf, city, north, carolina, and, sea, turtles, 911, in, hainan, china, one, rescued, sea, turtle, named, nickel, for, the, coin, that, was, found, lodged, in, her, throat, lives, at, the, shedd, aquarium, in, chicago, sea, turtles, are, believed, to, have, a, commensal, relationship, with, some, barnacles, in, which, the, barnacles, benefit, from, growing, on, sea, turtles, without, harming, them, barnacles, are, small, hard, shelled, crustaceans, found, attached, to, multiple, different, substrates, below, or, just, above, the, ocean, the, adult, barnacle, is, a, sessile, organism, however, in, its, larval, stage, it, is, planktonic, and, can, move, about, the, water, column, the, larval, stage, chooses, where, to, settle, and, ultimately, the, habitat, for, its, full, adult, life, which, is, typically, between, 5, and, 10, years, however, estimates, of, age, for, a, common, sea, turtle, barnacle, species, chelonibia, testudinaria, suggest, that, this, species, lives, for, at, least, 21, months, with, individuals, older, than, this, uncommon, chelonibia, barnacles, have, also, been, used, to, distinguish, between, the, foraging, areas, of, sea, turtle, hosts, by, analyzing, stable, isotope, ratios, in, barnacle, shell, material, scientist, can, identify, differences, in, the, water, temperature, and, salinity, that, different, hosts, have, been, swimming, through, and, thus, differentiate, between, the, home, areas, of, host, sea, turtles, a, favorite, settlement, for, barnacle, larvae, is, the, shell, or, skin, around, the, neck, of, sea, turtles, the, larvae, glue, themselves, to, the, chosen, spot, a, thin, layer, of, flesh, is, wrapped, around, them, and, a, shell, is, secreted, many, species, of, barnacles, can, settle, on, any, substrate, however, some, species, of, barnacles, have, an, obligatory, commensal, relationship, with, specific, animals, which, makes, finding, a, suitable, location, harder, around, 29, species, of, turtle, barnacles, have, been, recorded, however, it, is, not, solely, on, sea, turtles, that, barnacles, can, be, found, other, organisms, also, serve, as, a, barnacle, s, settlements, these, organisms, include, mollusks, whales, decapod, crustaceans, manatees, and, several, other, groups, related, to, these, species, sea, turtle, shells, are, an, ideal, habitat, for, adult, barnacles, for, three, reasons, sea, turtles, tend, to, live, long, lives, greater, than, 70, years, so, barnacles, do, not, have, to, worry, about, host, death, however, mortality, in, sea, turtle, barnacles, is, often, driven, by, their, host, shedding, the, scutes, on, which, the, barnacle, is, attached, rather, than, the, death, of, the, sea, turtle, itself, secondly, barnacles, are, suspension, feeders, sea, turtles, spend, most, of, their, lives, swimming, and, following, ocean, currents, and, as, water, runs, along, the, back, of, the, sea, turtle, s, shell, it, passes, over, the, barnacles, providing, an, almost, constant, water, flow, and, influx, of, food, particles, lastly, the, long, distances, and, inter, ocean, travel, these, sea, turtles, swim, throughout, their, lifetime, offers, the, perfect, mechanism, for, dispersal, of, barnacle, larvae, allowing, the, barnacle, species, to, distribute, themselves, throughout, global, waters, is, a, high, fitness, advantage, of, this, commensalism, this, relationship, however, is, not, truly, commensal, while, the, barnacles, are, not, directly, parasitic, to, their, hosts, they, have, negative, effects, to, the, sea, turtles, on, which, they, choose, to, reside, the, barnacles, add, extra, weight, and, drag, to, the, sea, turtle, increasing, the, energy, it, needs, for, swimming, and, affecting, its, ability, to, capture, prey, with, the, effect, increasing, with, the, quantity, of, barnacles, affixed, to, its, back
