all, other, species, in, canini, foxes, are, small, to, medium, sized, omnivorous, mammals, belonging, to, several, genera, of, the, family, canidae, they, have, a, flattened, skull, upright, triangular, ears, a, pointed, slightly, upturned, snout, and, a, long, bushy, tail, brush, twelve, species, belong, to, the, monophyletic, true, fox, group, of, genus, vulpes, another, 25, current, or, extinct, species, are, sometimes, called, foxes, they, are, part, of, the, paraphyletic, group, of, the, south, american, foxes, or, an, outlying, group, which, consists, of, the, bat, eared, fox, gray, fox, and, island, fox, foxes, live, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, the, most, common, and, widespread, species, of, fox, is, the, red, fox, vulpes, vulpes, with, about, 47, recognized, subspecies, the, global, distribution, of, foxes, together, with, their, widespread, reputation, for, cunning, has, contributed, to, their, prominence, in, popular, culture, and, folklore, in, many, societies, around, the, world, the, hunting, of, foxes, with, packs, of, hounds, long, an, established, pursuit, in, europe, especially, in, the, british, isles, was, exported, by, european, settlers, to, various, parts, of, the, new, world, the, word, fox, comes, from, old, english, and, derives, from, proto, germanic, fuhsaz, this, in, turn, derives, from, proto, indo, european, pu, thick, haired, tail, male, foxes, are, known, as, dogs, tods, or, reynards, females, as, vixens, and, young, as, cubs, pups, or, kits, though, the, last, term, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, kit, fox, a, distinct, species, vixen, is, one, of, very, few, modern, english, words, that, retain, the, middle, english, southern, dialectal, v, pronunciation, instead, of, f, i, e, northern, english, fox, versus, southern, english, vox, a, group, of, foxes, is, referred, to, as, a, skulk, leash, or, earth, within, the, canidae, the, results, of, dna, analysis, shows, several, phylogenetic, divisions, foxes, are, generally, smaller, than, some, other, members, of, the, family, canidae, such, as, wolves, and, jackals, while, they, may, be, larger, than, some, within, the, family, such, as, raccoon, dogs, in, the, largest, species, the, red, fox, males, weigh, between, 4, 1, and, 8, 7, kilograms, 9, and, 19, 1, 4, pounds, while, the, smallest, species, the, fennec, fox, weighs, just, 0, 7, to, 1, 6, kg, 1, 1, 2, to, 3, 1, 2, lb, fox, features, typically, include, a, triangular, face, pointed, ears, an, elongated, rostrum, and, a, bushy, tail, they, are, digitigrade, meaning, they, walk, on, their, toes, unlike, most, members, of, the, family, canidae, foxes, have, partially, retractable, claws, fox, vibrissae, or, whiskers, are, black, the, whiskers, on, the, muzzle, known, as, mystacial, vibrissae, average, 100, 110, millimetres, 3, 7, 8, 4, 3, 8, inches, long, while, the, whiskers, everywhere, else, on, the, head, average, to, be, shorter, in, length, whiskers, carpal, vibrissae, are, also, on, the, forelimbs, and, average, 40, mm, 1, 5, 8, in, long, pointing, downward, and, backward, other, physical, characteristics, vary, according, to, habitat, and, adaptive, significance, fox, species, differ, in, fur, color, length, and, density, coat, colors, range, from, pearly, white, to, black, and, white, to, black, flecked, with, white, or, grey, on, the, underside, fennec, foxes, and, other, species, of, fox, adapted, to, life, in, the, desert, such, as, kit, foxes, for, example, have, large, ears, and, short, fur, to, aid, in, keeping, the, body, cool, arctic, foxes, on, the, other, hand, have, tiny, ears, and, short, limbs, as, well, as, thick, insulating, fur, which, aid, in, keeping, the, body, warm, red, foxes, by, contrast, have, a, typical, auburn, pelt, the, tail, normally, ending, with, a, white, marking, a, fox, s, coat, color, and, texture, may, vary, due, to, the, change, in, seasons, fox, pelts, are, richer, and, denser, in, the, colder, months, and, lighter, in, the, warmer, months, to, get, rid, of, the, dense, winter, coat, foxes, moult, once, a, year, around, april, the, process, begins, from, the, feet, up, the, legs, and, then, along, the, back, coat, color, may, also, change, as, the, individual, ages, a, fox, s, dentition, like, all, other, canids, is, i, 3, 3, c, 1, 1, pm, 4, 4, m, 3, 2, 42, bat, eared, foxes, have, six, extra, molars, totalling, in, 48, teeth, foxes, have, pronounced, carnassial, pairs, which, is, characteristic, of, a, carnivore, these, pairs, consist, of, the, upper, premolar, and, the, lower, first, molar, and, work, together, to, shear, tough, material, like, flesh, foxes, canines, are, pronounced, also, characteristic, of, a, carnivore, and, are, excellent, in, gripping, prey, in, the, wild, the, typical, lifespan, of, a, fox, is, one, to, three, years, although, individuals, may, live, up, to, ten, years, unlike, many, canids, foxes, are, not, always, pack, animals, typically, they, live, in, small, family, groups, but, some, such, as, arctic, foxes, are, known, to, be, solitary, foxes, are, omnivores, their, diet, is, made, up, primarily, of, invertebrates, such, as, insects, and, small, vertebrates, such, as, reptiles, and, birds, they, may, also, eat, eggs, and, vegetation, many, species, are, generalist, predators, but, some, such, as, the, crab, eating, fox, have, more, specialized, diets, most, species, of, fox, consume, around, 1, kg, 2, 2, lb, of, food, every, day, foxes, cache, excess, food, burying, it, for, later, consumption, usually, under, leaves, snow, or, soil, while, hunting, foxes, tend, to, use, a, particular, pouncing, technique, such, that, they, crouch, down, to, camouflage, themselves, in, the, terrain, and, then, use, their, hind, legs, to, leap, up, with, great, force, and, land, on, top, of, their, chosen, prey, using, their, pronounced, canine, teeth, they, can, then, grip, the, prey, s, neck, and, shake, it, until, it, is, dead, or, can, be, readily, disemboweled, the, gray, fox, is, one, of, only, two, canine, species, known, to, regularly, climb, trees, the, other, is, the, raccoon, dog, the, male, fox, s, scrotum, is, held, up, close, to, the, body, with, the, testes, inside, even, after, they, descend, like, other, canines, the, male, fox, has, a, baculum, or, penile, bone, the, testes, of, red, foxes, are, smaller, than, those, of, arctic, foxes, sperm, formation, in, red, foxes, begins, in, august, september, with, the, testicles, attaining, their, greatest, weight, in, december, february, vixens, are, in, heat, for, one, to, six, days, making, their, reproductive, cycle, twelve, months, long, as, with, other, canines, the, ova, are, shed, during, estrus, without, the, need, for, the, stimulation, of, copulating, once, the, egg, is, fertilized, the, vixen, enters, a, period, of, gestation, that, can, last, from, 52, to, 53, days, foxes, tend, to, have, an, average, litter, size, of, four, to, five, with, an, 80, percent, success, rate, in, becoming, pregnant, litter, sizes, can, vary, greatly, according, to, species, and, environment, the, arctic, fox, for, example, can, have, up, to, eleven, kits, the, vixen, usually, has, six, or, eight, mammae, each, teat, has, 8, to, 20, lactiferous, ducts, which, connect, the, mammary, gland, to, the, nipple, allowing, for, milk, to, be, carried, to, the, nipple, the, fox, s, vocal, repertoire, is, vast, and, includes, in, the, case, of, domesticated, foxes, the, whining, seems, to, remain, in, adult, individuals, as, a, sign, of, excitement, and, submission, in, the, presence, of, their, owners, canids, commonly, known, as, foxes, include, the, following, genera, and, species, several, fox, species, are, endangered, in, their, native, environments, pressures, placed, on, foxes, include, habitat, loss, and, being, hunted, for, pelts, other, trade, or, control, due, in, part, to, their, opportunistic, hunting, style, and, industriousness, foxes, are, commonly, resented, as, nuisance, animals, contrastingly, foxes, while, often, considered, pests, themselves, have, been, successfully, employed, to, control, pests, on, fruit, farms, while, leaving, the, fruit, intact, the, island, fox, though, considered, a, near, threatened, species, throughout, the, world, is, becoming, increasingly, endangered, in, its, endemic, environment, of, the, california, channel, islands, a, population, on, an, island, is, smaller, than, those, on, the, mainland, because, of, limited, resources, like, space, food, and, shelter, island, populations, are, therefore, highly, susceptible, to, external, threats, ranging, from, introduced, predatory, species, and, humans, to, extreme, weather, on, the, california, channel, islands, it, was, found, that, the, population, of, the, island, fox, was, so, low, due, to, an, outbreak, of, canine, distemper, virus, from, 1999, to, 2000, as, well, as, predation, by, non, native, golden, eagles, since, 1993, the, eagles, have, caused, the, population, to, decline, by, as, much, as, 95, because, of, the, low, number, of, foxes, the, population, went, through, an, allee, effect, an, effect, in, which, at, low, enough, densities, an, individual, s, fitness, decreases, conservationists, had, to, take, healthy, breeding, pairs, out, of, the, wild, population, to, breed, them, in, captivity, until, they, had, enough, foxes, to, release, back, into, the, wild, nonnative, grazers, were, also, removed, so, that, native, plants, would, be, able, to, grow, back, to, their, natural, height, thereby, providing, adequate, cover, and, protection, for, the, foxes, against, golden, eagles, darwin, s, fox, was, considered, critically, endangered, because, of, their, small, known, population, of, 250, mature, individuals, as, well, as, their, restricted, distribution, however, the, iucn, have, since, downgraded, the, conservation, status, from, crictically, endangered, in, their, 2004, and, 2008, assessments, to, endangered, in, the, 2016, assessment, following, findings, of, a, wider, distribution, than, previously, reported, on, the, chilean, mainland, the, population, is, limited, to, nahuelbuta, national, park, and, the, surrounding, valdivian, rainforest, similarly, on, chilo, island, their, population, is, limited, to, the, forests, that, extend, from, the, southernmost, to, the, northwesternmost, part, of, the, island, though, the, nahuelbuta, national, park, is, protected, 90, of, the, species, live, on, chilo, island, a, major, issue, the, species, faces, is, their, dwindling, limited, habitat, due, to, the, cutting, and, burning, of, the, unprotected, forests, because, of, deforestation, the, darwin, s, fox, habitat, is, shrinking, allowing, for, their, competitor, s, chilla, fox, preferred, habitat, of, open, space, to, increase, the, darwin, s, fox, subsequently, is, being, outcompeted, another, problem, they, face, is, their, inability, to, fight, off, diseases, transmitted, by, the, increasing, number, of, pet, dogs, to, conserve, these, animals, researchers, suggest, the, need, for, the, forests, that, link, the, nahuelbuta, national, park, to, the, coast, of, chile, and, in, turn, chilo, island, and, its, forests, to, be, protected, they, also, suggest, that, other, forests, around, chile, be, examined, to, determine, whether, darwin, s, foxes, have, previously, existed, there, or, can, live, there, in, the, future, should, the, need, to, reintroduce, the, species, to, those, areas, arise, and, finally, the, researchers, advise, for, the, creation, of, a, captive, breeding, program, in, chile, because, of, the, limited, number, of, mature, individuals, in, the, wild, foxes, are, often, considered, pests, or, nuisance, creatures, for, their, opportunistic, attacks, on, poultry, and, other, small, livestock, fox, attacks, on, humans, are, not, common, many, foxes, adapt, well, to, human, environments, with, several, species, classified, as, resident, urban, carnivores, for, their, ability, to, sustain, populations, entirely, within, urban, boundaries, foxes, in, urban, areas, can, live, longer, and, can, have, smaller, litter, sizes, than, foxes, in, non, urban, areas, urban, foxes, are, ubiquitous, in, europe, where, they, show, altered, behaviors, compared, to, non, urban, foxes, including, increased, population, density, smaller, territory, and, pack, foraging, foxes, have, been, introduced, in, numerous, locations, with, varying, effects, on, indigenous, flora, and, fauna, in, some, countries, foxes, are, major, predators, of, rabbits, and, hens, population, oscillations, of, these, two, species, were, the, first, nonlinear, oscillation, studied, and, led, to, the, derivation, of, the, lotka, volterra, equation, fox, meat, is, edible, though, it, is, not, considered, a, common, cuisine, in, any, country, fox, hunting, originated, in, the, united, kingdom, in, the, 16th, century, hunting, with, dogs, is, now, banned, in, the, united, kingdom, though, hunting, without, dogs, is, still, permitted, red, foxes, were, introduced, into, australia, in, the, early, 19th, century, for, sport, and, have, since, become, widespread, through, much, of, the, country, they, have, caused, population, decline, among, many, native, species, and, prey, on, livestock, especially, new, lambs, fox, hunting, is, practiced, as, recreation, in, several, other, countries, including, canada, france, ireland, italy, russia, united, states, and, australia, there, are, many, records, of, domesticated, red, foxes, and, others, but, rarely, of, sustained, domestication, a, recent, and, notable, exception, is, the, russian, silver, fox, which, resulted, in, visible, and, behavioral, changes, and, is, a, case, study, of, an, animal, population, modeling, according, to, human, domestication, needs, the, current, group, of, domesticated, silver, foxes, are, the, result, of, nearly, fifty, years, of, experiments, in, the, soviet, union, and, russia, to, de, novo, domesticate, the, silver, morph, of, the, red, fox, this, selective, breeding, resulted, in, physical, and, behavioral, traits, appearing, that, are, frequently, seen, in, domestic, cats, dogs, and, other, animals, such, as, pigmentation, changes, floppy, ears, and, curly, tails, notably, the, new, foxes, became, more, tame, allowing, themselves, to, be, petted, whimpering, to, get, attention, and, sniffing, and, licking, their, caretakers, foxes, are, among, the, comparatively, few, mammals, which, have, been, able, to, adapt, themselves, to, a, certain, degree, to, living, in, urban, mostly, suburban, human, environments, their, omnivorous, diet, allows, them, to, survive, on, discarded, food, waste, and, their, skittish, and, often, nocturnal, nature, means, that, they, are, often, able, to, avoid, detection, despite, their, larger, size, urban, foxes, have, been, identified, as, threats, to, cats, and, small, dogs, and, for, this, reason, there, is, often, pressure, to, exclude, them, from, these, environments, the, san, joaquin, kit, fox, is, a, highly, endangered, species, that, has, ironically, become, adapted, to, urban, living, in, the, san, joaquin, valley, and, salinas, valley, of, southern, california, its, diet, includes, mice, ground, squirrels, rabbits, hares, bird, eggs, and, insects, and, it, has, claimed, habitats, in, open, areas, golf, courses, drainage, basins, and, school, grounds, though, rare, bites, by, foxes, have, been, reported, in, 2018, a, woman, in, clapham, london, was, bitten, on, the, arm, by, a, fox, after, she, had, left, the, door, to, her, flat, open, the, fox, appears, in, many, cultures, usually, in, folklore, there, are, slight, variations, in, their, depictions, in, western, and, persian, folklore, foxes, are, symbols, of, cunning, and, trickery, a, reputation, derived, especially, from, their, reputed, ability, to, evade, hunters, this, is, usually, represented, as, a, character, possessing, these, traits, these, traits, are, used, on, a, wide, variety, of, characters, either, making, them, a, nuisance, to, the, story, a, misunderstood, hero, or, a, devious, villain, in, asian, folklore, foxes, are, depicted, as, familiar, spirits, possessing, magic, powers, similar, to, in, western, folklore, foxes, are, portrayed, as, mischievous, usually, tricking, other, people, with, the, ability, to, disguise, as, an, attractive, female, human, others, depict, them, as, mystical, sacred, creatures, who, can, bring, wonder, or, ruin, nine, tailed, foxes, appear, in, chinese, folklore, literature, and, mythology, in, which, depending, on, the, tale, they, can, be, a, good, or, a, bad, omen, the, motif, was, eventually, introduced, from, chinese, to, japanese, and, korean, cultures, the, constellation, vulpecula, represents, a, fox
