gramineae, juss, poaceae, p, o, e, s, i, i, a, also, called, gramineae, r, m, n, i, i, a, is, a, large, and, nearly, ubiquitous, family, of, monocotyledonous, flowering, plants, commonly, known, as, grasses, it, includes, the, cereal, grasses, bamboos, the, grasses, of, natural, grassland, and, species, cultivated, in, lawns, and, pasture, the, latter, are, commonly, referred, to, collectively, as, grass, with, around, 780, genera, and, around, 12, 000, species, the, poaceae, is, the, fifth, largest, plant, family, following, the, asteraceae, orchidaceae, fabaceae, and, rubiaceae, the, poaceae, are, the, most, economically, important, plant, family, providing, staple, foods, from, domesticated, cereal, crops, such, as, maize, wheat, rice, oats, barley, and, millet, for, people, and, as, feed, for, meat, producing, animals, they, provide, through, direct, human, consumption, just, over, one, half, 51, of, all, dietary, energy, rice, provides, 20, wheat, supplies, 20, maize, corn, 5, 5, and, other, grains, 6, some, members, of, the, poaceae, are, used, as, building, materials, bamboo, thatch, and, straw, others, can, provide, a, source, of, biofuel, primarily, via, the, conversion, of, maize, to, ethanol, grasses, have, stems, that, are, hollow, except, at, the, nodes, and, narrow, alternate, leaves, borne, in, two, ranks, the, lower, part, of, each, leaf, encloses, the, stem, forming, a, leaf, sheath, the, leaf, grows, from, the, base, of, the, blade, an, adaptation, allowing, it, to, cope, with, frequent, grazing, grasslands, such, as, savannah, and, prairie, where, grasses, are, dominant, are, estimated, to, constitute, 40, 5, of, the, land, area, of, the, earth, excluding, greenland, and, antarctica, grasses, are, also, an, important, part, of, the, vegetation, in, many, other, habitats, including, wetlands, forests, and, tundra, though, they, are, commonly, called, grasses, groups, such, as, the, seagrasses, rushes, and, sedges, fall, outside, this, family, the, rushes, and, sedges, are, related, to, the, poaceae, being, members, of, the, order, poales, but, the, seagrasses, are, members, of, the, order, alismatales, however, all, of, them, belong, to, the, monocot, group, of, plants, grasses, may, be, annual, or, perennial, herbs, 10, generally, with, the, following, characteristics, the, image, gallery, can, be, used, for, reference, the, stems, of, grasses, called, culms, are, usually, cylindrical, more, rarely, flattened, but, not, 3, angled, and, are, hollow, plugged, at, the, nodes, where, the, leaves, are, attached, grass, leaves, are, nearly, always, alternate, and, distichous, in, one, plane, and, have, parallel, veins, 11, each, leaf, is, differentiated, into, a, lower, sheath, hugging, the, stem, and, a, blade, with, entire, i, e, smooth, margins, 11, the, leaf, blades, of, many, grasses, are, hardened, with, silica, phytoliths, which, discourage, grazing, animals, some, such, as, sword, grass, are, sharp, enough, to, cut, human, skin, a, membranous, appendage, or, fringe, of, hairs, called, the, ligule, lies, at, the, junction, between, sheath, and, blade, preventing, water, or, insects, from, penetrating, into, the, sheath, 11, flowers, of, poaceae, are, characteristically, arranged, in, spikelets, each, having, one, or, more, florets, 12, the, spikelets, are, further, grouped, into, panicles, or, spikes, the, part, of, the, spikelet, that, bears, the, florets, is, called, the, rachilla, a, spikelet, consists, of, two, or, sometimes, fewer, bracts, at, the, base, called, glumes, followed, by, one, or, more, florets, 13, a, floret, consists, of, the, flower, surrounded, by, two, bracts, one, external, the, lemma, and, one, internal, the, palea, the, flowers, are, usually, hermaphroditic, maize, being, an, important, exception, and, mainly, anemophilous, or, wind, pollinated, although, insects, occasionally, play, a, role, the, perianth, is, reduced, to, two, scales, called, lodicules, 11, that, expand, and, contract, to, spread, the, lemma, and, palea, these, are, generally, interpreted, to, be, modified, sepals, the, fruit, of, grasses, is, a, caryopsis, in, which, the, seed, coat, is, fused, to, the, fruit, wall, 16, a, tiller, is, a, leafy, shoot, other, than, the, first, shoot, produced, from, the, seed, 11, grass, blades, grow, at, the, base, of, the, blade, and, not, from, elongated, stem, tips, this, low, growth, point, evolved, in, response, to, grazing, animals, and, allows, grasses, to, be, grazed, or, mown, regularly, without, severe, damage, to, the, plant, 113, 114, three, general, classifications, of, growth, habit, present, in, grasses, bunch, type, also, called, caespitose, stoloniferous, and, rhizomatous, the, success, of, the, grasses, lies, in, part, in, their, morphology, and, growth, processes, and, in, part, in, their, physiological, diversity, there, are, both, c3, and, c4, grasses, referring, to, the, photosynthetic, pathway, for, carbon, fixation, the, c4, grasses, have, a, photosynthetic, pathway, linked, to, specialized, kranz, leaf, anatomy, which, allows, for, increased, water, use, efficiency, rendering, them, better, adapted, to, hot, arid, environments, the, c3, grasses, are, referred, to, as, cool, season, grasses, while, the, c4, plants, are, considered, warm, season, grasses, 18, 19, although, the, c4, species, are, all, in, the, pacmad, clade, see, diagram, below, it, seems, that, various, forms, of, c4, have, arisen, some, twenty, or, more, times, in, various, subfamilies, or, genera, in, the, aristida, genus, for, example, one, species, a, longifolia, is, c3, but, the, approximately, 300, other, species, are, c4, as, another, example, the, whole, tribe, of, andropogoneae, which, includes, maize, sorghum, sugar, cane, job, s, tears, and, bluestem, grasses, is, c4, around, 46, percent, of, grass, species, are, c4, plants, the, name, poaceae, was, given, by, john, hendley, barnhart, in, 1895, 7, based, on, the, tribe, poeae, described, in, 1814, by, robert, brown, and, the, type, genus, poa, described, in, 1753, by, carl, linnaeus, the, term, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, p, a, fodder, grasses, include, some, of, the, most, versatile, plant, life, forms, they, became, widespread, toward, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, and, fossilized, dinosaur, dung, coprolites, have, been, found, containing, phytoliths, of, a, variety, that, include, grasses, that, are, related, to, modern, rice, and, bamboo, grasses, have, adapted, to, conditions, in, lush, rain, forests, dry, deserts, cold, mountains, and, even, intertidal, habitats, and, are, currently, the, most, widespread, plant, type, grass, is, a, valuable, source, of, food, and, energy, for, all, sorts, of, wildlife, a, cladogram, shows, subfamilies, and, approximate, species, numbers, in, brackets, chloridoideae, 1600, danthonioideae, 300, micrairoideae, 200, arundinoideae, 50, panicoideae, 3250, aristidoideae, 350, oryzoideae, 110, bambusoideae, bamboos, 1450, pooideae, 3850, puelioideae, 11, pharoideae, 13, anomochlooideae, 4, before, 2005, fossil, findings, indicated, that, grasses, evolved, around, 55, million, years, ago, finds, of, grass, like, phytoliths, in, cretaceous, dinosaur, coprolites, from, the, latest, cretaceous, maastrichtian, aged, lameta, formation, of, india, have, pushed, this, date, back, to, 66, million, years, ago, in, 2011, fossils, from, the, same, deposit, were, found, to, belong, to, the, modern, rice, tribe, oryzeae, suggesting, substantial, diversification, of, major, lineages, by, this, time, in, 2018, a, study, described, grass, microfossils, extracted, from, the, teeth, of, the, hadrosauroid, dinosaur, equijubus, normani, from, northern, china, dating, to, the, albian, stage, of, the, early, cretaceous, approximately, 113, 100, million, years, ago, which, were, found, to, belong, to, primitive, lineages, within, poaceae, similar, in, position, to, the, anomochlooideae, these, are, currently, the, oldest, known, grass, fossils, the, relationships, among, the, three, subfamilies, bambusoideae, oryzoideae, and, pooideae, in, the, bop, clade, have, been, resolved, bambusoideae, and, pooideae, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, oryzoideae, this, separation, occurred, within, the, relatively, short, time, span, of, about, 4, million, years, according, to, lester, charles, king, the, spread, of, grasses, in, the, late, cenozoic, would, have, changed, patterns, of, hillslope, evolution, favouring, slopes, that, are, convex, upslope, and, concave, downslope, and, lacking, a, free, face, were, common, king, argued, that, this, was, the, result, of, more, slowly, acting, surface, wash, caused, by, carpets, of, grass, which, in, turn, would, have, resulted, in, relatively, more, soil, creep, there, are, about, 12, 000, grass, species, in, about, 771, genera, that, are, classified, into, 12, subfamilies, see, the, full, list, of, poaceae, genera, the, grass, family, is, one, of, the, most, widely, distributed, and, abundant, groups, of, plants, on, earth, grasses, are, found, on, every, continent, including, antarctica, the, antarctic, hair, grass, deschampsia, antarctica, is, one, of, only, two, plant, species, native, to, the, western, antarctic, peninsula, grasses, are, the, dominant, vegetation, in, many, habitats, including, grassland, salt, marsh, reedswamp, and, steppes, they, also, occur, as, a, smaller, part, of, the, vegetation, in, almost, every, other, terrestrial, habitat, grass, dominated, biomes, are, called, grasslands, if, only, large, contiguous, areas, of, grasslands, are, counted, these, biomes, cover, 31, of, the, planet, s, land, grasslands, include, pampas, steppes, and, prairies, grasses, provide, food, to, many, grazing, mammals, as, well, as, to, many, species, of, butterflies, and, moths, many, types, of, animals, eat, grass, as, their, main, source, of, food, and, are, called, graminivores, these, include, cattle, sheep, horses, rabbits, and, many, invertebrates, such, as, grasshoppers, and, the, caterpillars, of, many, brown, butterflies, grasses, are, also, eaten, by, omnivorous, or, even, occasionally, by, primarily, carnivorous, animals, grasses, dominate, certain, biomes, especially, temperate, grasslands, because, many, species, are, adapted, to, grazing, and, fire, grasses, are, unusual, in, that, the, meristem, is, near, the, bottom, of, the, plant, hence, grasses, can, quickly, recover, from, cropping, at, the, top, the, evolution, of, large, grazing, animals, in, the, cenozoic, contributed, to, the, spread, of, grasses, without, large, grazers, fire, cleared, areas, are, quickly, colonized, by, grasses, and, with, enough, rain, tree, seedlings, trees, eventually, outcompete, most, grasses, trampling, grazers, kill, seedling, trees, but, not, grasses, 137, sexual, reproduction, and, meiosis, have, been, studied, in, rice, maize, wheat, and, barley, meiosis, research, in, these, crop, species, is, linked, to, crop, improvement, since, meiotic, recombination, is, an, important, component, of, plant, breeding, unlike, in, animals, the, specification, of, both, male, and, female, plant, germlines, occurs, late, in, development, during, flowering, the, transition, from, the, sporophyte, phase, to, the, gametophyte, state, is, initiated, by, meiotic, entry, grasses, are, in, human, terms, perhaps, the, most, economically, important, plant, family, their, economic, importance, stems, from, several, areas, including, food, production, industry, and, lawns, they, have, been, grown, as, food, for, domesticated, animals, for, up, to, 6, 000, years, and, the, grains, of, grasses, such, as, wheat, rice, maize, corn, and, barley, have, been, the, most, important, human, food, crops, grasses, are, also, used, in, the, manufacture, of, thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, timber, for, fencing, furniture, scaffolding, and, construction, materials, floor, matting, sports, turf, and, baskets, of, all, crops, grown, 70, are, grasses, agricultural, grasses, grown, for, their, edible, seeds, are, called, cereals, or, grains, although, the, latter, term, when, used, agriculturally, refers, to, both, cereals, and, similar, seeds, of, other, plant, species, such, as, buckwheat, and, legumes, three, cereals, rice, wheat, and, maize, corn, provide, more, than, half, of, all, calories, consumed, by, humans, cereals, constitute, the, major, source, of, carbohydrates, for, humans, and, perhaps, the, major, source, of, protein, these, include, rice, in, southern, and, eastern, asia, maize, in, central, and, south, america, and, wheat, and, barley, in, europe, northern, asia, and, the, americas, sugarcane, is, the, major, source, of, sugar, production, additional, food, uses, of, sugarcane, include, sprouted, grain, shoots, and, rhizomes, and, in, drink, they, include, sugarcane, juice, and, plant, milk, as, well, as, rum, beer, whisky, and, vodka, bamboo, shoots, are, used, in, numerous, asian, dishes, and, broths, and, are, available, in, supermarkets, in, various, sliced, forms, in, both, fresh, fermented, and, canned, versions, lemongrass, is, a, grass, used, as, a, culinary, herb, for, its, citrus, like, flavor, and, scent, many, species, of, grass, are, grown, as, pasture, for, foraging, or, as, fodder, for, prescribed, livestock, feeds, particularly, in, the, case, of, cattle, horses, and, sheep, such, grasses, may, be, cut, and, stored, for, later, feeding, especially, for, the, winter, in, the, form, of, bales, of, hay, or, straw, or, in, silos, as, silage, straw, and, sometimes, hay, may, also, be, used, as, bedding, for, animals, an, example, of, a, sod, forming, perennial, grass, used, in, agriculture, is, thinopyrum, intermedium, grasses, are, used, as, raw, material, for, a, multitude, of, purposes, including, construction, and, in, the, composition, of, building, materials, such, as, cob, for, insulation, in, the, manufacture, of, paper, and, board, such, as, oriented, structural, straw, board, grass, fiber, can, be, used, for, making, paper, biofuel, production, nonwoven, fabrics, and, as, replacement, for, glass, fibers, used, in, reinforced, plastics, bamboo, scaffolding, is, able, to, withstand, typhoon, force, winds, that, would, break, steel, scaffolding, larger, bamboos, and, arundo, donax, have, stout, culms, that, can, be, used, in, a, manner, similar, to, timber, arundo, is, used, to, make, reeds, for, woodwind, instruments, and, bamboo, is, used, for, innumerable, implements, phragmites, australis, common, reed, is, important, for, thatching, and, wall, construction, of, homes, in, africa, grasses, are, used, in, water, treatment, systems, in, wetland, conservation, and, land, reclamation, and, used, to, lessen, the, erosional, impact, of, urban, storm, water, runoff, pollen, morphology, particularly, in, the, poaceae, family, is, key, to, figuring, out, their, evolutionary, relationships, and, how, environments, have, changed, over, time, grass, pollen, grains, however, often, look, the, same, making, it, hard, to, use, them, for, detailed, climate, or, environmental, reconstructions, grass, pollen, has, a, single, pore, and, can, vary, a, lot, in, size, from, about, 20, to, over, 100, micrometers, and, this, size, difference, has, been, looked, into, for, clues, about, past, habitats, to, tell, apart, domesticated, grasses, from, wild, ones, and, to, indicate, various, biological, features, like, how, they, perform, photosynthesis, their, breeding, systems, and, genetic, complexity, yet, there, s, ongoing, debate, about, how, effective, pollen, size, is, for, piecing, together, historical, landscapes, and, weather, patterns, considering, other, factors, such, as, genetic, material, amount, might, also, affect, pollen, size, despite, these, challenges, new, techniques, in, fourier, transform, infrared, spectroscopy, ft, ir, and, improved, statistical, methods, are, now, helping, to, better, identify, these, similar, looking, pollen, types, grasses, are, the, primary, plants, used, in, lawns, which, themselves, derive, from, grazed, grasslands, in, europe, they, also, provide, an, important, means, of, erosion, control, e, g, along, roadsides, especially, on, sloping, land, grass, lawns, are, an, important, covering, of, playing, surfaces, in, many, sports, including, football, soccer, american, football, tennis, golf, cricket, softball, and, baseball, ornamental, grasses, such, as, perennial, bunch, grasses, are, used, in, many, styles, of, garden, design, for, their, foliage, inflorescences, and, seed, heads, they, are, often, used, in, natural, landscaping, xeriscaping, and, slope, and, beach, stabilization, in, contemporary, landscaping, wildlife, gardening, and, native, plant, gardening, they, are, used, as, screens, and, hedges, grass, playing, fields, courses, and, pitches, are, the, traditional, playing, surfaces, for, many, sports, including, american, football, association, football, baseball, cricket, golf, and, rugby, grass, surfaces, are, also, sometimes, used, for, horse, racing, and, tennis, type, of, maintenance, and, species, of, grass, used, may, be, important, factors, for, some, sports, less, critical, for, others, in, some, sports, facilities, including, indoor, domes, and, other, places, where, maintenance, of, a, grass, field, would, be, difficult, grass, may, be, replaced, with, artificial, turf, a, synthetic, grass, like, substitute, in, cricket, the, pitch, is, the, strip, of, carefully, mowed, and, rolled, grass, where, the, bowler, bowls, in, the, days, leading, up, to, the, match, it, is, repeatedly, mowed, and, rolled, to, produce, a, very, hard, flat, surface, for, the, ball, to, bounce, off, grass, on, golf, courses, is, kept, in, three, distinct, conditions, that, of, the, rough, the, fairway, and, the, putting, green, grass, on, the, fairway, is, mown, short, and, even, allowing, the, player, to, strike, the, ball, cleanly, playing, from, the, rough, is, a, disadvantage, because, the, long, grass, may, affect, the, flight, of, the, ball, grass, on, the, putting, green, is, the, shortest, and, most, even, ideally, allowing, the, ball, to, roll, smoothly, over, the, surface, an, entire, industry, revolves, around, the, development, and, marketing, of, turf, grass, varieties, in, tennis, grass, is, grown, on, very, hard, packed, soil, and, the, bounce, of, a, tennis, ball, may, vary, depending, on, the, grass, s, health, how, recently, it, has, been, mowed, and, the, wear, and, tear, of, recent, play, the, surface, is, softer, than, hard, courts, and, clay, other, tennis, surfaces, so, the, ball, bounces, lower, and, players, must, reach, the, ball, faster, resulting, in, a, different, style, of, play, which, may, suit, some, players, more, than, others, among, the, world, s, most, prestigious, court, for, grass, tennis, is, centre, court, at, wimbledon, london, which, hosts, the, final, of, the, annual, wimbledon, championships, in, england, one, of, the, four, grand, slam, tournaments, a, number, of, grasses, are, invasive, species, that, damage, natural, ecosystems, including, forms, of, phragmites, australis, which, are, native, to, eurasia, but, has, spread, around, the, world, grasses, have, long, had, significance, in, human, society, they, have, been, cultivated, as, feed, for, people, and, domesticated, animals, for, thousands, of, years, the, primary, ingredient, of, beer, is, usually, barley, or, wheat, both, of, which, have, been, used, for, this, purpose, for, over, 4, 000, years, in, some, places, particularly, in, suburban, areas, the, maintenance, of, a, grass, lawn, is, a, sign, of, a, homeowner, s, responsibility, to, the, overall, appearance, of, their, neighborhood, one, work, credits, lawn, maintenance, to, the, desire, for, upward, mobility, and, its, manifestation, in, the, lawn, as, virginia, jenkins, author, of, the, lawn, put, it, quite, bluntly, upper, middle, class, americans, emulated, aristocratic, society, with, their, own, small, semi, rural, estates, in, general, the, lawn, was, one, of, the, primary, selling, points, of, these, new, suburban, homes, as, it, shifted, social, class, designations, from, the, equity, and, ubiquity, of, urban, homes, connected, to, the, streets, with, the, upper, middle, class, designation, of, a, healthy, green, space, and, the, status, symbol, that, is, the, front, lawn, in, communities, with, drought, problems, watering, of, lawns, may, be, restricted, to, certain, times, of, day, or, days, of, the, week, many, us, municipalities, and, homeowners, associations, have, rules, which, require, lawns, to, be, maintained, to, certain, specifications, sanctioning, those, who, allow, the, grass, to, grow, too, long, the, smell, of, freshly, cut, grass, is, produced, mainly, by, cis, 3, hexenal, some, common, aphorisms, involve, grass, for, example, a, folk, myth, about, grass, is, that, it, refuses, to, grow, where, any, violent, death, has, occurred
