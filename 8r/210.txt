excretion, is, elimination, of, metabolic, waste, which, is, an, essential, process, in, all, organisms, in, vertebrates, this, is, primarily, carried, out, by, the, lungs, kidneys, and, skin, this, is, in, contrast, with, secretion, where, the, substance, may, have, specific, tasks, after, leaving, the, cell, for, example, placental, mammals, expel, urine, from, the, bladder, through, the, urethra, which, is, part, of, the, excretory, system, unicellular, organisms, discharge, waste, products, directly, through, the, surface, of, the, cell, during, life, activities, such, as, cellular, respiration, several, chemical, reactions, take, place, in, the, body, these, are, known, as, metabolism, these, chemical, reactions, produce, waste, products, such, as, carbon, dioxide, water, salts, urea, and, uric, acid, accumulation, of, these, wastes, beyond, a, level, inside, the, body, is, harmful, to, the, body, the, excretory, organs, remove, these, wastes, this, process, of, removal, of, metabolic, waste, from, the, body, is, known, as, excretion, green, plants, excrete, carbon, dioxide, and, water, as, respiratory, products, in, green, plants, the, carbon, dioxide, released, during, respiration, gets, used, during, photosynthesis, oxygen, is, a, byproduct, generated, during, photosynthesis, and, exits, through, stomata, root, cell, walls, and, other, routes, plants, can, get, rid, of, excess, water, by, transpiration, and, guttation, it, has, been, shown, that, the, leaf, acts, as, an, excretophore, and, in, addition, to, being, a, primary, organ, of, photosynthesis, is, also, used, as, a, method, of, excreting, toxic, wastes, via, diffusion, other, waste, materials, that, are, exuded, by, some, plants, resin, saps, latex, etc, are, forced, from, the, interior, of, the, plant, by, hydrostatic, pressures, inside, the, plant, and, by, absorptive, forces, of, plant, cells, these, latter, processes, do, not, need, added, energy, they, act, passively, however, during, the, pre, abscission, phase, the, metabolic, levels, of, a, leaf, are, high, plants, also, excrete, some, waste, substances, into, the, soil, around, them, in, animals, the, main, excretory, products, are, carbon, dioxide, ammonia, in, ammoniotelics, urea, in, ureotelics, uric, acid, in, uricotelics, guanine, in, arachnida, and, creatine, the, liver, and, kidneys, clear, many, substances, from, the, blood, for, example, in, renal, excretion, and, the, cleared, substances, are, then, excreted, from, the, body, in, the, urine, and, feces, aquatic, animals, usually, excrete, ammonia, directly, into, the, external, environment, as, this, compound, has, high, solubility, and, there, is, ample, water, available, for, dilution, in, terrestrial, animals, ammonia, like, compounds, are, converted, into, other, nitrogenous, materials, i, e, urea, that, are, less, harmful, as, there, is, less, water, in, the, environment, and, ammonia, itself, is, toxic, this, process, is, called, detoxification, birds, excrete, their, nitrogenous, wastes, as, uric, acid, in, the, form, of, a, paste, although, this, process, is, metabolically, more, expensive, it, allows, more, efficient, water, retention, and, it, can, be, stored, more, easily, in, the, egg, many, avian, species, especially, seabirds, can, also, excrete, salt, via, specialized, nasal, salt, glands, the, saline, solution, leaving, through, nostrils, in, the, beak, in, insects, a, system, involving, malpighian, tubules, is, used, to, excrete, metabolic, waste, metabolic, waste, diffuses, or, is, actively, transported, into, the, tubule, which, transports, the, wastes, to, the, intestines, the, metabolic, waste, is, then, released, from, the, body, along, with, fecal, matter, the, excreted, material, may, be, called, ejecta, in, pathology, the, word, ejecta, is, more, commonly, used
