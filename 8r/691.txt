8, see, text, pelicans, genus, pelecanus, are, a, genus, of, large, water, birds, that, make, up, the, family, pelecanidae, they, are, characterized, by, a, long, beak, and, a, large, throat, pouch, used, for, catching, prey, and, draining, water, from, the, scooped, up, contents, before, swallowing, they, have, predominantly, pale, plumage, except, for, the, brown, and, peruvian, pelicans, the, bills, pouches, and, bare, facial, skin, of, all, pelicans, become, brightly, coloured, before, the, breeding, season, the, eight, living, pelican, species, have, a, patchy, seasonally, dependent, yet, global, distribution, ranging, latitudinally, from, the, tropics, to, the, temperate, zone, pelicans, are, absent, from, interior, amazonian, south, america, from, polar, regions, and, the, open, ocean, at, least, one, species, is, known, to, migrate, to, the, inland, desert, of, australia, s, red, centre, after, heavy, rains, create, temporary, lakes, white, pelicans, are, also, observed, at, the, american, state, of, utah, s, great, salt, lake, for, example, some, 600, miles, 965, km, from, the, nearest, coastline, the, pacific, west, coast, they, have, also, been, seen, hundreds, of, miles, inland, in, north, america, having, flown, northwards, along, the, mississippi, river, and, other, large, waterways, long, thought, to, be, related, to, frigatebirds, cormorants, tropicbirds, and, gannets, and, boobies, pelicans, instead, are, most, closely, related, to, the, shoebill, and, hamerkop, storks, although, these, two, birds, are, not, actually, true, storks, and, are, placed, in, the, order, pelecaniformes, ibises, spoonbills, herons, and, bitterns, have, been, classified, in, the, same, order, fossil, evidence, of, pelicans, dates, back, at, least, 36, million, years, to, the, remains, of, a, tibiotarsus, recovered, from, late, eocene, strata, of, egypt, that, bears, striking, similarity, to, modern, species, of, pelican, they, are, thought, to, have, evolved, in, the, old, world, and, spread, into, the, americas, this, is, reflected, in, the, relationships, within, the, genus, as, the, eight, species, divide, into, old, world, and, new, world, lineages, this, hypothesis, is, supported, by, fossil, evidence, from, the, oldest, pelican, taxa, pelicans, will, frequent, inland, waterways, but, are, most, known, for, residing, along, maritime, and, coastal, zones, where, they, feed, principally, on, fish, in, their, large, throat, pouches, diving, into, the, water, and, catching, them, at, near, the, water, s, surface, they, can, adapt, to, varying, degrees, of, water, salinity, from, freshwater, and, brackish, to, most, commonly, seawater, they, are, gregarious, birds, travelling, in, flocks, hunting, cooperatively, and, breeding, colonially, four, white, plumaged, species, tend, to, nest, on, the, ground, and, four, brown, or, grey, plumaged, species, nest, mainly, in, trees, the, relationship, between, pelicans, and, people, has, often, been, contentious, the, birds, have, been, persecuted, because, of, their, perceived, competition, with, commercial, and, recreational, fishing, their, populations, have, fallen, through, habitat, destruction, disturbance, and, environmental, pollution, and, three, species, are, of, conservation, concern, they, also, have, a, long, history, of, cultural, significance, in, mythology, and, in, christian, and, heraldic, iconography, the, name, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, word, pelekan, which, is, itself, derived, from, the, word, pelekys, meaning, axe, in, classical, times, the, word, was, applied, to, both, the, pelican, and, the, woodpecker, the, genus, pelecanus, was, first, formally, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, landmark, 1758, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, he, described, the, distinguishing, characteristics, as, a, straight, bill, hooked, at, the, tip, linear, nostrils, a, bare, face, and, fully, webbed, feet, this, early, definition, included, frigatebirds, cormorants, and, sulids, as, well, as, pelicans, the, family, pelecanidae, was, introduced, as, pelicanea, by, the, french, polymath, constantine, samuel, rafinesque, in, 1815, pelicans, give, their, name, to, the, pelecaniformes, an, order, which, has, a, varied, taxonomic, history, tropicbirds, darters, cormorants, gannets, boobies, and, frigatebirds, all, traditional, members, of, the, order, have, since, been, reclassified, tropicbirds, into, their, own, order, phaethontiformes, and, the, remainder, into, the, suliformes, in, their, place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the, hamerkop, and, the, shoebill, have, now, been, transferred, into, the, pelecaniformes, molecular, evidence, suggests, that, the, shoebill, and, the, hamerkop, form, a, sister, group, to, the, pelicans, though, some, doubt, exists, as, to, the, exact, relationships, among, the, three, lineages, the, oldest, known, record, of, pelicans, is, a, right, tibiotarsus, very, similar, to, those, of, modern, species, from, the, birket, qarun, formation, in, the, wadi, el, hitan, in, egypt, dating, to, the, late, eocene, priabonian, referred, to, the, genus, eopelecanus, p, rufescens, p, philippensis, p, crispus, p, conspicillatus, p, onocrotalus, p, occidentalis, p, thagus, p, erythrorhynchos, suliformes, herons, ardeidae, ibises, and, spoonbills, threskiornithidae, hamerkop, scopus, umbretta, shoebill, balaeniceps, rex, pelicans, pelecanus, cladogram, based, on, hackett, et, al, 2008, the, eight, living, pelican, species, were, traditionally, divided, into, two, groups, one, containing, four, ground, nesters, with, mainly, white, adult, plumage, australian, dalmatian, great, white, and, american, white, pelicans, and, one, containing, four, grey, or, brown, plumaged, species, which, nest, preferentially, either, in, trees, pink, backed, spot, billed, and, brown, pelicans, or, on, sea, rocks, peruvian, pelican, the, largely, marine, brown, and, peruvian, pelicans, formerly, considered, conspecific, are, sometimes, separated, from, the, others, by, placement, in, the, subgenus, leptopelecanus, but, in, fact, species, with, both, sorts, of, appearance, and, nesting, behavior, are, found, in, either, dna, sequencing, of, both, mitochondrial, and, nuclear, genes, yielded, quite, different, relationships, the, three, new, world, pelicans, formed, one, lineage, with, the, american, white, pelican, sister, to, the, two, brown, pelicans, and, the, five, old, world, species, the, other, the, dalmatian, pink, backed, and, spot, billed, were, all, closely, related, to, one, another, while, the, australian, white, pelican, was, their, next, closest, relative, the, great, white, pelican, also, belonged, to, this, lineage, but, was, the, first, to, diverge, from, the, common, ancestor, of, the, other, four, species, this, finding, suggests, that, pelicans, evolved, in, the, old, world, and, spread, into, the, americas, and, that, preference, for, tree, or, ground, nesting, is, more, related, to, size, than, genetics, the, fossil, record, shows, that, the, pelican, lineage, has, existed, for, at, least, 36, million, years, the, oldest, known, pelican, fossil, was, assigned, to, eopelecanus, aegyptiacus, and, was, found, in, late, eocene, middle, to, late, part, of, the, early, priabonian, stage, age, deposits, of, the, birket, qarun, formation, within, the, wadi, al, hitan, world, heritage, site, in, egypt, a, more, complete, fossil, pelican, of, early, oligocene, age, is, known, from, deposits, at, the, luberon, in, southeastern, france, and, is, remarkably, similar, to, modern, forms, its, beak, is, almost, complete, and, is, morphologically, identical, to, that, of, present, day, pelicans, showing, that, this, advanced, feeding, apparatus, was, already, in, existence, at, the, time, an, early, miocene, fossil, has, been, named, miopelecanus, gracilis, on, the, basis, of, certain, features, originally, considered, unique, but, later, thought, to, lie, within, the, range, of, interspecific, variation, in, pelecanus, the, late, eocene, protopelicanus, may, be, a, pelecaniform, or, suliform, or, a, similar, aquatic, bird, such, as, a, pseudotooth, pelagornithidae, but, is, not, generally, considered, a, pelecanid, the, supposed, miocene, pelican, liptornis, from, patagonia, is, a, nomen, dubium, of, doubtful, validity, being, based, on, fragments, providing, insufficient, evidence, to, support, a, valid, description, fossil, finds, from, north, america, have, been, meagre, compared, with, europe, which, has, a, richer, fossil, record, several, pelecanus, species, have, been, described, from, fossil, material, including, pelicans, are, very, large, birds, with, very, long, bills, characterised, by, a, downcurved, hook, at, the, end, of, the, upper, mandible, and, the, attachment, of, a, huge, gular, pouch, to, the, lower, the, slender, rami, of, the, lower, bill, and, the, flexible, tongue, muscles, form, the, pouch, into, a, basket, for, catching, fish, and, sometimes, rainwater, though, to, not, hinder, the, swallowing, of, large, fish, the, tongue, itself, is, tiny, they, have, a, long, neck, and, short, stout, legs, with, large, fully, webbed, feet, although, they, are, among, the, heaviest, of, flying, birds, they, are, relatively, light, for, their, apparent, bulk, because, of, air, pockets, in, the, skeleton, and, beneath, the, skin, enabling, them, to, float, high, in, the, water, the, tail, is, short, and, square, the, wings, are, long, and, broad, suitably, shaped, for, soaring, and, gliding, flight, and, have, the, unusually, large, number, of, 30, to, 35, secondary, flight, feathers, males, are, generally, larger, than, females, and, have, longer, bills, the, smallest, species, is, the, brown, pelican, small, individuals, of, which, can, be, no, more, than, 2, 75, kg, 6, 1, lb, and, 1, 06, m, 3, 5, ft, long, with, a, wingspan, of, as, little, as, 1, 83, m, 6, 0, ft, the, largest, is, believed, to, be, the, dalmatian, at, up, to, 15, kg, 33, lb, and, 1, 83, m, 6, 0, ft, in, length, with, a, maximum, wingspan, of, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, the, australian, pelican, s, bill, may, grow, up, to, 0, 5, m, 1, 6, ft, long, in, large, males, the, longest, of, any, bird, pelicans, have, mainly, light, coloured, plumage, the, exceptions, being, the, brown, and, peruvian, pelicans, the, bills, pouches, and, bare, facial, skin, of, all, species, become, brighter, before, breeding, season, commences, the, throat, pouch, of, the, californian, subspecies, of, the, brown, pelican, turns, bright, red, and, fades, to, yellow, after, the, eggs, are, laid, while, the, throat, pouch, of, the, peruvian, pelican, turns, blue, the, american, white, pelican, grows, a, prominent, knob, on, its, bill, that, is, shed, once, females, have, laid, eggs, the, plumage, of, immature, pelicans, is, darker, than, that, of, adults, newly, hatched, chicks, are, naked, and, pink, darkening, to, grey, or, black, after, 4, to, 14, days, then, developing, a, covering, of, white, or, grey, down, anatomical, dissections, of, two, brown, pelicans, in, 1939, showed, that, pelicans, have, a, network, of, air, sacs, under, their, skin, situated, across, the, ventral, surface, including, the, throat, breast, and, undersides, of, the, wings, as, well, as, having, air, sacs, in, their, bones, the, air, sacs, are, connected, to, the, airways, of, the, respiratory, system, and, the, pelican, can, keep, its, air, sacs, inflated, by, closing, its, glottis, but, how, air, sacs, are, inflated, is, not, clear, the, air, sacs, serve, to, keep, the, pelican, remarkably, buoyant, in, the, water, and, may, also, cushion, the, impact, of, the, pelican, s, body, on, the, water, surface, when, they, dive, from, flight, into, water, to, catch, fish, superficial, air, sacs, may, also, help, to, round, body, contours, especially, over, the, abdomen, where, surface, protuberances, may, be, caused, by, viscera, changing, size, and, position, to, enable, the, overlying, feathers, to, form, more, effective, heat, insulation, and, also, to, enable, feathers, to, be, held, in, position, for, good, aerodynamics, modern, pelicans, are, found, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, they, primarily, inhabit, warm, regions, although, breeding, ranges, extend, to, latitudes, of, 45, south, australian, pelicans, in, tasmania, and, 60, north, american, white, pelicans, in, western, canada, birds, of, inland, and, coastal, waters, they, are, absent, from, polar, regions, the, deep, ocean, oceanic, islands, except, the, galapagos, and, inland, south, america, as, well, as, from, the, eastern, coast, of, south, america, from, the, mouth, of, the, amazon, river, southwards, subfossil, bones, have, been, recovered, from, as, far, south, as, new, zealand, s, south, island, although, their, scarcity, and, isolated, occurrence, suggests, that, these, remains, may, have, merely, been, vagrants, from, australia, much, as, is, the, case, today, pelicans, swim, well, with, their, strong, legs, and, their, webbed, feet, they, rub, the, backs, of, their, heads, on, their, preen, glands, to, pick, up, an, oily, secretion, which, they, transfer, to, their, plumage, to, waterproof, it, holding, their, wings, only, loosely, against, their, bodies, pelicans, float, with, relatively, little, of, their, bodies, below, the, water, surface, they, dissipate, excess, heat, by, gular, flutter, rippling, the, skin, of, the, throat, and, pouch, with, the, bill, open, to, promote, evaporative, cooling, they, roost, and, loaf, communally, on, beaches, sandbanks, and, in, shallow, water, a, fibrous, layer, deep, in, the, breast, muscles, can, hold, the, wings, rigidly, horizontal, for, gliding, and, soaring, thus, they, use, thermals, for, soaring, to, heights, of, 3000, m, 10, 000, ft, or, more, combined, both, with, gliding, and, with, flapping, flight, in, v, formation, to, commute, distances, up, to, 150, km, 93, mi, to, feeding, areas, pelicans, also, fly, low, or, skim, over, stretches, of, water, using, a, phenomenon, known, as, ground, effect, to, reduce, drag, and, increase, lift, as, the, air, flows, between, the, wings, and, the, water, surface, it, is, compressed, to, a, higher, density, and, exerts, a, stronger, upward, force, against, the, bird, above, hence, substantial, energy, is, saved, while, flying, adult, pelicans, rely, on, visual, displays, and, behaviour, to, communicate, particularly, using, their, wings, and, bills, agonistic, behaviour, consists, of, thrusting, and, snapping, at, opponents, with, their, bills, or, lifting, and, waving, their, wings, in, a, threatening, manner, adult, pelicans, grunt, when, at, the, colony, but, are, generally, silent, elsewhere, or, outside, breeding, season, conversely, colonies, are, noisy, as, chicks, vocalise, extensively, pelicans, are, gregarious, and, nest, colonially, pairs, are, monogamous, for, a, single, season, but, the, pair, bond, extends, only, to, the, nesting, area, mates, are, independent, away, from, the, nest, the, ground, nesting, white, species, have, a, complex, communal, courtship, involving, a, group, of, males, chasing, a, single, female, in, the, air, on, land, or, in, the, water, while, pointing, gaping, and, thrusting, their, bills, at, each, other, they, can, finish, the, process, in, a, day, the, tree, nesting, species, have, a, simpler, process, in, which, perched, males, advertise, for, females, the, location, of, the, breeding, colony, is, constrained, by, the, availability, of, an, ample, supply, of, fish, to, eat, although, pelicans, can, use, thermals, to, soar, and, commute, for, hundreds, of, kilometres, daily, to, fetch, food, the, australian, pelican, has, two, reproductive, strategies, depending, on, the, local, degree, of, environmental, predictability, colonies, of, tens, or, hundreds, rarely, thousands, of, birds, breed, regularly, on, small, coastal, and, subcoastal, islands, where, food, is, seasonally, or, permanently, available, in, arid, inland, australia, especially, in, the, endorheic, lake, eyre, basin, pelicans, breed, opportunistically, in, very, large, numbers, of, up, to, 50, 000, pairs, when, irregular, major, floods, which, may, be, many, years, apart, fill, ephemeral, salt, lakes, and, provide, large, amounts, of, food, for, several, months, before, drying, out, again, in, all, species, copulation, takes, place, at, the, nest, site, it, begins, shortly, after, pairing, and, continues, for, 3, 10, days, before, egg, laying, the, male, brings, the, nesting, material, in, ground, nesting, species, which, may, not, build, a, nest, sometimes, in, the, pouch, and, in, tree, nesting, species, crosswise, in, the, bill, the, female, then, heaps, the, material, up, to, form, a, simple, structure, the, eggs, are, oval, white, and, coarsely, textured, all, species, normally, lay, at, least, two, eggs, the, usual, clutch, size, is, one, to, three, rarely, up, to, six, both, sexes, incubate, with, the, eggs, on, top, of, or, below, the, feet, they, may, display, when, changing, shifts, incubation, takes, 30, 36, days, hatching, success, for, undisturbed, pairs, can, be, as, high, as, 95, but, because, of, sibling, competition, or, siblicide, in, the, wild, usually, all, but, one, nestling, dies, within, the, first, few, weeks, later, in, the, pink, backed, and, spot, billed, species, both, parents, feed, their, young, small, chicks, are, fed, by, regurgitation, after, about, a, week, they, are, able, to, put, their, heads, into, their, parents, pouches, and, feed, themselves, sometimes, before, but, especially, after, being, fed, the, pelican, chick, may, seem, to, throw, a, tantrum, by, loudly, vocalizing, and, dragging, itself, around, in, a, circle, by, one, wing, and, leg, striking, its, head, on, the, ground, or, anything, nearby, and, the, tantrums, sometimes, end, in, what, looks, like, a, seizure, that, results, in, the, chick, falling, briefly, unconscious, the, reason, is, not, clearly, known, but, a, common, belief, is, that, it, is, to, draw, attention, to, itself, and, away, from, any, siblings, who, are, waiting, to, be, fed, parents, of, ground, nesting, species, sometimes, drag, older, young, around, roughly, by, the, head, before, feeding, them, from, about, 25, days, old, the, young, of, these, species, gather, in, pods, or, cr, ches, of, up, to, 100, birds, in, which, parents, recognise, and, feed, only, their, own, offspring, by, 6, 8, weeks, they, wander, around, occasionally, swimming, and, may, practise, communal, feeding, young, of, all, species, fledge, 10, 12, weeks, after, hatching, they, may, remain, with, their, parents, afterwards, but, are, now, seldom, or, never, fed, they, are, mature, at, three, or, four, years, old, overall, breeding, success, is, highly, variable, pelicans, live, for, 15, to, 25, years, in, the, wild, although, one, reached, an, age, of, 54, years, in, captivity, the, diet, of, pelicans, usually, consists, of, fish, but, occasionally, amphibians, turtles, crustaceans, insects, birds, and, mammals, are, also, eaten, the, size, of, the, preferred, prey, fish, varies, depending, on, pelican, species, and, location, for, example, in, africa, the, pink, backed, pelican, generally, takes, fish, ranging, in, size, from, fry, up, to, 400, g, 0, 9, lb, and, the, great, white, pelican, prefers, somewhat, larger, fish, up, to, 600, g, 1, 3, lb, but, in, europe, the, latter, species, has, been, recorded, taking, fish, up, to, 1, 850, g, 4, 1, lb, in, deep, water, white, pelicans, often, fish, alone, nearer, the, shore, several, encircle, schools, of, small, fish, or, form, a, line, to, drive, them, into, the, shallows, beating, their, wings, on, the, water, surface, and, then, scooping, up, the, prey, although, all, pelican, species, may, feed, in, groups, or, alone, the, dalmatian, pink, backed, and, spot, billed, pelicans, are, the, only, ones, to, prefer, solitary, feeding, when, fishing, in, groups, all, pelican, species, have, been, known, to, work, together, to, catch, their, prey, and, dalmatian, pelicans, may, even, cooperate, with, great, cormorants, large, fish, are, caught, with, the, bill, tip, then, tossed, up, in, the, air, to, be, caught, and, slid, into, the, gullet, head, first, a, gull, will, sometimes, stand, on, the, pelican, s, head, peck, it, to, distraction, and, grab, a, fish, from, the, open, bill, pelicans, in, their, turn, sometimes, snatch, prey, from, other, waterbirds, the, brown, pelican, usually, plunge, dives, head, first, for, its, prey, from, a, height, as, great, as, 10, 20, m, 33, 66, ft, especially, for, anchovies, and, menhaden, the, only, other, pelican, to, feed, using, a, similar, technique, is, the, peruvian, pelican, but, its, dives, are, typically, from, a, lower, height, than, the, brown, pelican, the, australian, and, american, white, pelicans, may, feed, by, low, plunge, dives, landing, feet, first, and, then, scooping, up, the, prey, with, the, beak, but, they, as, well, as, the, remaining, pelican, species, primarily, feed, while, swimming, on, the, water, aquatic, prey, is, most, commonly, taken, at, or, near, the, water, surface, although, principally, a, fish, eater, the, australian, pelican, is, also, an, eclectic, and, opportunistic, scavenger, and, carnivore, that, forages, in, landfill, sites, as, well, as, taking, carrion, and, anything, from, insects, and, small, crustaceans, to, ducks, and, small, dogs, food, is, not, stored, in, a, pelican, s, throat, pouch, contrary, to, popular, folklore, pelicans, may, also, eat, birds, in, southern, africa, eggs, and, chicks, of, the, cape, cormorant, are, an, important, food, source, for, great, white, pelicans, several, other, bird, species, have, been, recorded, in, the, diet, of, this, pelican, in, south, africa, including, cape, gannet, chicks, on, malgas, island, as, well, as, crowned, cormorants, kelp, gulls, greater, crested, terns, and, african, penguins, on, dassen, island, and, elsewhere, the, australian, pelican, which, is, particularly, willing, to, take, a, wide, range, of, prey, items, has, been, recorded, feeding, on, young, australian, white, ibis, and, young, and, adult, grey, teals, and, silver, gulls, brown, pelicans, have, been, reported, preying, on, young, common, murres, in, california, and, the, eggs, and, nestlings, of, cattle, egrets, and, nestling, great, egrets, in, baja, california, mexico, peruvian, pelicans, in, chile, have, been, recorded, feeding, on, nestlings, of, imperial, shags, juvenile, peruvian, diving, petrels, and, grey, gulls, cannibalism, of, chicks, of, their, own, species, is, known, from, the, australian, brown, and, peruvian, pelicans, non, native, great, white, pelicans, have, been, observed, swallowing, city, pigeons, in, st, james, s, park, in, london, england, globally, pelican, populations, are, adversely, affected, by, these, main, factors, declining, supplies, of, fish, through, overfishing, or, water, pollution, destruction, of, habitat, direct, effects, of, human, activity, such, as, disturbance, at, nesting, colonies, hunting, and, culling, entanglement, in, fishing, lines, and, hooks, and, the, presence, of, pollutants, such, as, ddt, and, endrin, most, species, populations, are, more, or, less, stable, although, three, are, classified, by, the, iucn, as, being, at, risk, all, species, breed, readily, in, zoos, which, is, potentially, useful, for, conservation, management, the, combined, population, of, brown, and, peruvian, pelicans, is, estimated, at, 650, 000, birds, with, around, 250, 000, in, the, united, states, and, caribbean, and, 400, 000, in, peru, the, national, audubon, society, estimates, the, global, population, of, the, brown, pelican, at, 300, 000, numbers, of, brown, pelican, plummeted, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, largely, as, a, consequence, of, environmental, ddt, pollution, and, the, species, was, listed, as, endangered, in, the, us, in, 1970, with, restrictions, on, ddt, use, in, the, us, from, 1972, its, population, has, recovered, and, it, was, delisted, in, 2009, the, peruvian, pelican, is, listed, as, near, threatened, because, although, the, population, is, estimated, by, birdlife, international, to, exceed, 500, 000, mature, individuals, and, is, possibly, increasing, it, has, been, much, higher, in, the, past, it, declined, dramatically, during, the, 1998, el, ni, o, event, and, could, experience, similar, declines, in, the, future, conservation, needs, include, regular, monitoring, throughout, the, range, to, determine, population, trends, particularly, after, el, ni, o, years, restricting, human, access, to, important, breeding, colonies, and, assessing, interactions, with, fisheries, the, spot, billed, pelican, has, an, estimated, population, between, 13, 000, and, 18, 000, and, is, considered, to, be, near, threatened, in, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, numbers, declined, substantially, during, the, 20th, century, one, crucial, factor, being, the, eradication, of, the, important, sittaung, valley, breeding, colony, in, burma, through, deforestation, and, the, loss, of, feeding, sites, the, chief, threats, it, faces, are, from, habitat, loss, and, human, disturbance, but, populations, have, mostly, stabilised, following, increased, protection, in, india, and, cambodia, the, pink, backed, pelican, has, a, large, population, ranging, over, much, of, sub, saharan, africa, in, the, absence, of, substantial, threats, or, evidence, of, declines, across, its, range, its, conservation, status, is, assessed, as, being, of, least, concern, regional, threats, include, the, drainage, of, wetlands, and, increasing, disturbance, in, southern, africa, the, species, is, susceptible, to, bioaccumulation, of, toxins, and, the, destruction, of, nesting, trees, by, logging, the, american, white, pelican, has, increased, in, numbers, with, its, population, estimated, at, over, 157, 000, birds, in, 2005, becoming, more, numerous, east, of, the, continental, divide, while, declining, in, the, west, however, whether, its, numbers, have, been, affected, by, exposure, to, pesticides, is, unclear, as, it, has, also, lost, habitat, through, wetland, drainage, and, competition, with, recreational, use, of, lakes, and, rivers, great, white, pelicans, range, over, a, large, area, of, africa, and, southern, asia, the, overall, trend, in, numbers, is, uncertain, with, a, mix, of, regional, populations, that, are, increasing, declining, stable, or, unknown, but, no, evidence, has, been, found, of, rapid, overall, decline, and, the, status, of, the, species, is, assessed, as, being, of, least, concern, threats, include, the, drainage, of, wetlands, persecution, and, sport, hunting, disturbance, at, the, breeding, colonies, and, contamination, by, pesticides, and, heavy, metals, the, dalmatian, pelican, has, a, population, estimated, at, between, 10, 000, and, 20, 000, following, massive, declines, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, main, ongoing, threats, include, hunting, especially, in, eastern, asia, disturbance, coastal, development, collision, with, overhead, power, lines, and, the, over, exploitation, of, fish, stocks, it, is, listed, as, near, threatened, by, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, as, the, population, trend, is, downwards, especially, in, mongolia, where, it, is, nearly, extinct, however, several, european, colonies, are, increasing, in, size, and, the, largest, colony, for, the, species, at, the, small, prespa, lake, in, greece, has, reached, about, 1, 400, breeding, pairs, following, conservation, measures, widespread, across, australia, the, australian, pelican, has, a, population, generally, estimated, at, between, 300, 000, and, 500, 000, individuals, overall, population, numbers, fluctuate, widely, and, erratically, depending, on, wetland, conditions, and, breeding, success, across, the, continent, the, species, is, assessed, as, being, of, least, concern, pelicans, have, been, persecuted, by, humans, for, their, perceived, competition, for, fish, despite, the, fact, that, their, diet, overlaps, little, with, fish, caught, by, people, starting, in, the, 1880s, american, white, pelicans, were, clubbed, and, shot, their, eggs, and, young, were, deliberately, destroyed, and, their, feeding, and, nesting, sites, were, degraded, by, water, management, schemes, and, wetland, drainage, even, in, the, 21st, century, an, increase, in, the, population, of, american, white, pelicans, in, southeastern, idaho, in, the, us, was, seen, to, threaten, the, recreational, cutthroat, trout, fishery, there, leading, to, official, attempts, to, reduce, pelican, numbers, through, systematic, harassment, and, culling, great, white, pelicans, on, dyer, island, in, the, western, cape, region, of, south, africa, were, culled, during, the, 19th, century, because, their, predation, of, the, eggs, and, chicks, of, guano, producing, seabirds, was, seen, to, threaten, the, livelihood, of, the, guano, collectors, more, recently, such, predation, at, south, african, seabird, colonies, has, impacted, on, the, conservation, of, threatened, seabird, populations, especially, crowned, cormorants, cape, cormorants, and, bank, cormorants, this, has, led, to, suggestions, that, pelican, numbers, should, be, controlled, at, vulnerable, colonies, apart, from, habitat, destruction, and, deliberate, targeted, persecution, pelicans, are, vulnerable, to, disturbance, at, their, breeding, colonies, by, birdwatchers, photographers, and, other, curious, visitors, human, presence, alone, can, cause, the, birds, to, accidentally, displace, or, destroy, their, eggs, leave, hatchlings, exposed, to, predators, and, adverse, weather, or, even, abandon, their, colonies, completely, ddt, pollution, in, the, environment, was, a, major, cause, of, decline, of, brown, pelican, populations, in, north, america, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, it, entered, the, oceanic, food, web, contaminating, and, accumulating, in, several, species, including, one, of, the, pelican, s, primary, food, fish, the, northern, anchovy, its, metabolite, dde, is, a, reproductive, toxicant, in, pelicans, and, many, other, birds, causing, eggshell, thinning, and, weakening, and, consequent, breeding, failure, through, the, eggs, being, accidentally, crushed, by, brooding, birds, since, an, effective, ban, on, the, use, of, ddt, was, implemented, in, the, us, in, 1972, the, eggshells, of, breeding, brown, pelicans, there, have, thickened, and, their, populations, have, largely, recovered, in, the, late, 1960s, following, the, major, decline, in, brown, pelican, numbers, in, louisiana, from, ddt, poisoning, 500, pelicans, were, imported, from, florida, to, augment, and, re, establish, the, population, over, 300, subsequently, died, in, april, and, may, 1975, from, poisoning, by, the, pesticide, endrin, about, 14, 000, pelicans, including, 7500, american, white, pelicans, perished, from, botulism, after, eating, fish, from, the, salton, sea, in, 1990, in, 1991, abnormal, numbers, of, brown, pelicans, and, brandt, s, cormorants, died, at, santa, cruz, california, when, their, food, fish, anchovies, were, contaminated, with, neurotoxic, domoic, acid, produced, by, the, diatom, pseudo, nitzschia, as, waterbirds, that, feed, on, fish, pelicans, are, highly, susceptible, to, oil, spills, both, directly, by, being, oiled, and, by, the, impact, on, their, food, resources, a, 2007, report, to, the, california, fish, and, game, commission, estimated, that, during, the, previous, 20, years, some, 500, 1000, brown, pelicans, had, been, affected, by, oil, spills, in, california, a, 2011, report, by, the, center, for, biological, diversity, a, year, after, the, april, 2010, deepwater, horizon, oil, spill, said, that, 932, brown, pelicans, had, been, collected, after, being, affected, by, oiling, and, estimated, that, 10, times, that, number, had, been, harmed, as, a, result, of, the, spill, where, pelicans, interact, with, fishers, through, either, sharing, the, same, waters, or, scavenging, for, fishing, refuse, they, are, especially, vulnerable, to, being, hooked, and, entangled, in, both, active, and, discarded, fishing, lines, fish, hooks, are, swallowed, or, catch, in, the, skin, of, the, pouch, or, webbed, feet, and, strong, monofilament, fishing, line, can, become, wound, around, bill, wings, or, legs, resulting, in, crippling, starvation, and, often, death, local, rescue, organisations, have, been, established, in, north, america, and, australia, by, volunteers, to, treat, and, rehabilitate, injured, pelicans, and, other, wildlife, as, with, other, bird, families, pelicans, are, susceptible, to, a, variety, of, parasites, avian, malaria, is, carried, by, the, mosquito, culex, pipens, and, high, densities, of, these, biting, insects, may, force, pelican, colonies, to, be, abandoned, leeches, may, attach, to, the, vent, or, sometimes, the, inside, of, the, pouch, a, study, of, the, parasites, of, the, american, white, pelican, found, 75, different, species, including, tapeworms, flukes, flies, fleas, ticks, and, nematodes, the, brown, pelican, has, a, similarly, extensive, range, of, parasites, the, nematodes, contracaecum, multipapillatum, and, c, mexicanum, and, the, trematode, ribeiroia, ondatrae, have, caused, illness, and, mortality, in, the, puerto, rican, population, possibly, endangering, the, pelican, on, this, island, many, pelican, parasites, are, found, in, other, bird, groups, but, several, lice, are, very, host, specific, healthy, pelicans, can, usually, cope, with, their, lice, but, sick, birds, may, carry, hundreds, of, individuals, which, hastens, a, sick, bird, s, demise, the, pouch, louse, piagetiella, peralis, occurs, in, the, pouch, and, so, it, cannot, be, removed, by, preening, while, this, is, usually, not, a, serious, problem, even, when, present, in, such, numbers, that, it, covers, the, whole, interior, of, the, pouch, sometimes, inflammation, and, bleeding, may, occur, from, it, and, harm, the, host, in, may, 2012, hundreds, of, peruvian, pelicans, were, reported, to, have, perished, in, peru, from, a, combination, of, starvation, and, roundworm, infestation, the, pelican, henet, in, egyptian, was, associated, in, ancient, egypt, with, death, and, the, afterlife, it, was, depicted, in, art, on, the, walls, of, tombs, and, figured, in, funerary, texts, as, a, protective, symbol, against, snakes, henet, was, also, referred, to, in, the, pyramid, texts, as, the, mother, of, the, king, and, thus, seen, as, a, goddess, references, in, nonroyal, funerary, papyri, show, that, the, pelican, was, believed, to, possess, the, ability, to, prophesy, safe, passage, in, the, underworld, for, someone, who, had, died, in, jewish, dietary, law, pelican, is, not, considered, kosher, fit, for, consumption, as, it, is, a, type, of, seabird, and, therefore, considered, an, unclean, animal, an, origin, myth, from, the, murri, people, of, queensland, cited, by, andrew, lang, describes, how, the, australian, pelican, acquired, its, black, and, white, plumage, the, story, tells, that, the, pelican, was, once, a, black, bird, during, a, flood, he, made, a, canoe, to, save, drowning, people, he, fell, in, love, with, a, woman, and, decided, to, save, her, but, she, and, her, friends, tricked, him, and, escaped, the, pelican, consequently, began, preparing, to, go, to, war, against, them, by, daubing, himself, with, white, clay, as, war, paint, before, he, had, finished, another, pelican, on, seeing, such, a, strange, piebald, creature, killed, him, with, its, beak, and, all, such, pelicans, have, been, black, and, white, ever, since, the, moche, people, of, ancient, peru, worshipped, nature, they, placed, emphasis, on, animals, and, often, depicted, pelicans, in, their, art, alcatraz, island, was, given, its, name, by, the, spanish, because, of, the, large, numbers, of, brown, pelicans, nesting, there, the, word, alcatraz, is, itself, derived, from, the, arabic, al, caduos, a, term, used, for, a, water, carrying, vessel, and, likened, to, the, pouch, of, the, pelican, the, english, name, albatross, is, also, derived, by, corruption, of, the, spanish, word, the, physiologus, a, didactic, christian, text, from, the, 3rd, or, 4th, century, claims, that, pelicans, kill, their, young, when, they, grow, and, strike, their, parents, in, the, face, but, then, the, mother, laments, them, for, three, days, after, which, she, strikes, her, side, and, brings, them, back, to, life, with, her, blood, the, physiologus, explains, this, as, mirroring, the, pain, inflicted, on, god, by, people, s, idolatry, and, the, self, sacrifice, of, jesus, on, the, cross, which, redeems, the, sinful, see, the, blood, and, water, gushing, from, the, wound, in, his, side, this, text, was, widely, copied, translated, and, sometimes, closely, paraphrased, during, the, middle, ages, for, instance, by, 13th, century, authors, guillaume, le, clerc, and, bartholomaeus, anglicus, in, a, newer, also, medieval, version, of, the, european, myth, the, pelican, was, thought, to, be, particularly, attentive, to, her, young, to, the, point, of, providing, them, with, blood, by, wounding, her, own, breast, when, no, other, food, was, available, as, a, result, the, pelican, came, to, symbolise, the, passion, of, jesus, and, the, eucharist, supplementing, the, image, of, the, lamb, and, the, flag, this, mythical, characteristic, is, referenced, in, the, hymn, adoro, te, devote, humbly, we, adore, thee, where, in, the, penultimate, verse, saint, thomas, aquinas, describes, christ, as, the, loving, divine, pelican, one, drop, of, whose, blood, can, save, the, world, similarly, the, 1678, christian, allegorical, novel, the, pilgrim, s, progress, describes, how, the, pelican, pierce, her, own, breast, with, her, bill, to, nourish, her, young, ones, with, her, blood, and, thereby, to, show, that, christ, the, blessed, so, loveth, his, young, his, people, as, to, save, them, from, death, by, his, blood, elizabeth, i, of, england, adopted, the, symbol, portraying, herself, as, the, mother, of, the, church, of, england, a, portrait, of, her, called, the, pelican, portrait, was, painted, around, 1573, probably, by, nicholas, hilliard, the, pelican, is, featured, in, many, christian, artworks, especially, in, europe, for, example, the, first, 1611, edition, of, the, king, james, bible, contains, a, depiction, of, a, pelican, feeding, her, young, in, an, oval, panel, at, the, bottom, of, the, title, page, the, pelican, in, her, piety, appears, in, the, 1686, reredos, by, grinling, gibbons, in, the, church, of, st, mary, abchurch, in, the, city, of, london, earlier, medieval, examples, of, the, motif, appear, in, painted, murals, for, example, the, mural, in, the, parish, church, of, belchamp, walter, essex, c, 1350, the, self, sacrificial, characterization, of, the, pelican, was, reinforced, by, widely, read, medieval, bestiaries, the, device, of, a, pelican, in, her, piety, or, a, pelican, vulning, from, latin, vulner, i, wound, i, injure, i, hurt, herself, was, used, in, religious, iconography, and, heraldry, the, legends, of, self, wounding, and, the, provision, of, blood, occur, across, cultures, for, example, an, indian, folktale, depicts, a, pelican, that, killed, her, young, by, rough, treatment, but, was, then, so, contrite, that, she, resurrected, them, with, her, own, blood, such, legends, may, have, arisen, because, of, the, impression, a, pelican, sometimes, gives, that, it, is, stabbing, itself, with, its, bill, in, reality, it, often, presses, this, onto, its, chest, to, fully, empty, the, pouch, another, possible, derivation, is, the, tendency, of, the, bird, to, rest, with, its, bill, on, its, breast, the, dalmatian, pelican, has, a, blood, red, pouch, in, the, early, breeding, season, and, this, may, have, contributed, to, the, myth, pelicans, have, featured, extensively, in, heraldry, generally, using, the, christian, symbolism, of, the, pelican, as, a, caring, and, self, sacrificing, parent, heraldic, images, featuring, a, pelican, vulning, refers, to, a, pelican, injuring, herself, while, a, pelican, in, her, piety, refers, to, a, female, pelican, feeding, her, young, with, her, own, blood, the, king, of, portugal, john, ii, adopted, the, pelican, as, is, own, personal, sygil, while, he, was, infante, evoking, the, christian, symbology, to, equate, the, sacrifice, of, his, blood, to, feed, the, nation, the, pelican, as, a, symbol, also, became, synonymous, with, the, increasing, charity, efforts, of, the, santas, casas, da, miseric, rdia, during, his, reign, and, the, reconstruction, of, the, hospital, das, caldas, da, rainha, and, the, hospital, real, de, todos, os, santos, which, were, mainly, patronaged, by, his, wife, d, leonor, the, image, became, linked, to, the, medieval, religious, feast, of, corpus, christi, the, universities, of, oxford, and, cambridge, each, have, colleges, named, for, the, religious, festival, nearest, the, dates, of, their, establishment, and, both, corpus, christi, college, cambridge, and, corpus, christi, college, oxford, feature, pelicans, on, their, coats, of, arms, the, medical, faculties, of, charles, university, in, prague, also, have, a, pelican, as, their, emblem, the, symbol, of, the, irish, blood, transfusion, service, is, a, pelican, and, for, most, of, its, existence, the, headquarters, of, the, service, was, located, at, pelican, house, in, dublin, ireland, the, heraldic, pelican, also, ended, up, as, a, pub, name, and, image, though, sometimes, with, the, image, of, the, ship, golden, hind, sir, francis, drake, s, famous, ship, was, initially, called, pelican, and, adorned, the, british, halfpenny, coin, the, great, white, pelican, is, the, national, bird, of, romania, the, brown, pelican, is, the, national, bird, of, three, caribbean, countries, saint, kitts, and, nevis, barbados, and, sint, maarten, and, features, on, their, coats, of, arms, it, is, also, the, state, bird, of, the, us, state, of, louisiana, which, is, known, colloquially, as, the, pelican, state, the, bird, appears, on, the, state, flag, and, state, seal, it, adorns, the, seals, of, louisiana, state, university, tulane, university, louisiana, tech, university, the, university, of, louisiana, at, lafayette, loyola, university, new, orleans,

issued, in, 1996, the, name, and, image, were, used, for, pelican, books, an, imprint, of, nonfiction, books, published, by, penguin, books, the, seal, of, the, packer, collegiate, institute, a, pelican, feeding, her, young, has, been, in, use, since, 1885, the, pelican, is, the, subject, of, a, popular, limerick, originally, composed, by, dixon, lanier, merritt, in, 1910, with, several, variations, by, other, authors, the, original, version, ran, a, wonderful, bird, is, the, pelican, his, bill, will, hold, more, than, his, belican, he, can, take, in, his, beak, food, enough, for, a,
