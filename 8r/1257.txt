a, placebo, p, l, s, i, b, o, pl, see, boh, is, a, substance, or, treatment, which, is, designed, to, have, no, therapeutic, value, common, placebos, include, inert, tablets, like, sugar, pills, inert, injections, like, saline, sham, surgery, and, other, procedures, placebos, are, used, in, randomized, clinical, trials, to, test, the, efficacy, of, medical, treatments, in, a, placebo, controlled, clinical, trial, any, change, in, the, control, group, is, known, as, the, placebo, response, and, the, difference, between, this, and, the, result, of, no, treatment, is, the, placebo, effect, placebos, in, clinical, trials, should, ideally, be, indistinguishable, from, so, called, verum, treatments, under, investigation, except, for, the, latter, s, particular, hypothesized, medicinal, effect, this, is, to, shield, test, participants, with, their, consent, from, knowing, who, is, getting, the, placebo, and, who, is, getting, the, treatment, under, test, as, patients, and, clinicians, expectations, of, efficacy, can, influence, results, the, idea, of, a, placebo, effect, was, discussed, in, 18th, century, psychology, but, became, more, prominent, in, the, 20th, century, modern, studies, find, that, placebos, can, affect, some, outcomes, such, as, pain, and, nausea, but, otherwise, do, not, generally, have, important, clinical, effects, improvements, that, patients, experience, after, being, treated, with, a, placebo, can, also, be, due, to, unrelated, factors, such, as, regression, to, the, mean, a, statistical, effect, where, an, unusually, high, or, low, measurement, is, likely, to, be, followed, by, a, less, extreme, one, the, use, of, placebos, in, clinical, medicine, raises, ethical, concerns, especially, if, they, are, disguised, as, an, active, treatment, as, this, introduces, dishonesty, into, the, doctor, patient, relationship, and, bypasses, informed, consent, placebos, are, also, popular, because, they, can, sometimes, produce, relief, through, psychological, mechanisms, a, phenomenon, known, as, the, placebo, effect, they, can, affect, how, patients, perceive, their, condition, and, encourage, the, body, s, chemical, processes, for, relieving, pain, and, a, few, other, symptoms, but, have, no, impact, on, the, disease, itself, placebo, pronounced, pla, kebo, or, pla, t, ebo, is, latin, for, shall, be, pleasing, it, was, used, as, a, name, for, the, vespers, in, the, office, of, the, dead, taken, from, its, incipit, a, quote, from, the, vulgate, s, psalm, 116, 9, psalm, 114, 9, in, modern, bibles, plac, b, domin, in, regi, ne, v, v, rum, shall, please, the, lord, in, the, land, of, the, living, from, that, a, singer, of, placebo, became, associated, with, someone, who, falsely, claimed, a, connection, to, the, deceased, to, get, a, share, of, the, funeral, meal, and, hence, a, flatterer, and, so, a, deceptive, act, to, please, the, definition, of, placebo, has, been, debated, one, definition, states, that, a, treatment, process, is, a, placebo, when, none, of, the, characteristic, treatment, factors, are, effective, remedial, or, harmful, in, the, patient, for, a, given, disease, in, a, clinical, trial, a, placebo, response, is, the, measured, response, of, subjects, to, a, placebo, the, placebo, effect, is, the, difference, between, that, response, and, no, treatment, the, placebo, response, may, include, improvements, due, to, natural, healing, declines, due, to, natural, disease, progression, the, tendency, for, people, who, were, temporarily, feeling, either, better, or, worse, than, usual, to, return, to, their, average, situations, regression, toward, the, mean, and, errors, in, the, clinical, trial, records, which, can, make, it, appear, that, a, change, has, happened, when, nothing, has, changed, it, is, also, part, of, the, recorded, response, to, any, active, medical, intervention, measurable, placebo, effects, may, be, either, objective, e, g, lowered, blood, pressure, or, subjective, e, g, a, lowered, perception, of, pain, placebos, can, improve, patient, reported, outcomes, such, as, pain, and, nausea, a, 2001, meta, analysis, of, the, placebo, effect, looked, at, trials, in, 40, different, medical, conditions, and, concluded, the, only, one, where, it, had, been, shown, to, have, a, significant, effect, was, for, pain, another, cochrane, review, in, 2010, suggested, that, placebo, effects, are, apparent, only, in, subjective, continuous, measures, and, in, the, treatment, of, pain, and, related, conditions, the, review, found, that, placebos, do, not, appear, to, affect, the, actual, diseases, or, outcomes, that, are, not, dependent, on, a, patient, s, perception, the, authors, asbj, rn, hr, bjartsson, and, peter, c, g, tzsche, concluded, that, their, study, did, not, find, that, placebo, interventions, have, important, clinical, effects, in, general, this, interpretation, has, been, subject, to, criticism, as, the, existence, of, placebo, effects, seems, undeniable, for, example, recent, research, has, linked, placebo, interventions, to, improved, motor, functions, in, patients, with, parkinson, s, disease, other, objective, outcomes, affected, by, placebos, include, immune, and, endocrine, parameters, end, organ, functions, regulated, by, the, autonomic, nervous, system, and, sport, performance, placebos, are, believed, to, be, capable, of, altering, a, person, s, perception, of, pain, according, to, the, american, cancer, society, a, person, might, reinterpret, a, sharp, pain, as, uncomfortable, tingling, measuring, the, extent, of, the, placebo, effect, is, difficult, due, to, confounding, factors, for, example, a, patient, may, feel, better, after, taking, a, placebo, due, to, regression, to, the, mean, i, e, a, natural, recovery, or, change, in, symptoms, but, this, can, be, ruled, out, by, comparing, the, placebo, group, with, a, no, treatment, group, as, all, the, placebo, research, does, it, is, harder, still, to, tell, the, difference, between, the, placebo, effect, and, the, effects, of, response, bias, observer, bias, and, other, flaws, in, trial, methodology, as, a, trial, comparing, placebo, treatment, and, no, treatment, will, not, be, a, blinded, experiment, in, their, 2010, meta, analysis, of, the, placebo, effect, asbj, rn, hr, bjartsson, and, peter, c, g, tzsche, argue, that, even, if, there, were, no, true, effect, of, placebo, one, would, expect, to, record, differences, between, placebo, and, no, treatment, groups, due, to, bias, associated, with, lack, of, blinding, one, way, in, which, the, magnitude, of, placebo, analgesia, can, be, measured, is, by, conducting, open, hidden, studies, in, which, some, patients, receive, an, analgesic, and, are, informed, that, they, will, be, receiving, it, open, while, others, are, administered, the, same, drug, without, their, knowledge, hidden, such, studies, have, found, that, analgesics, are, considerably, more, effective, when, the, patient, knows, they, are, receiving, them, a, review, published, in, jama, psychiatry, found, that, in, trials, of, antipsychotic, medications, the, change, in, response, to, receiving, a, placebo, had, increased, significantly, between, 1960, and, 2013, the, review, s, authors, identified, several, factors, that, could, be, responsible, for, this, change, including, inflation, of, baseline, scores, and, enrollment, of, fewer, severely, ill, patients, another, analysis, published, in, pain, in, 2015, found, that, placebo, responses, had, increased, considerably, in, neuropathic, pain, clinical, trials, conducted, in, the, united, states, from, 1990, to, 2013, the, researchers, suggested, that, this, may, be, because, such, trials, have, increased, in, study, size, and, length, during, this, time, period, children, seem, to, have, a, greater, response, than, adults, to, placebos, the, administration, of, the, placebos, can, determine, the, placebo, effect, strength, studies, have, found, that, taking, more, pills, would, strengthen, the, effect, capsules, appear, to, be, more, influential, than, pills, and, injections, are, even, stronger, than, capsules, some, studies, have, investigated, the, use, of, placebos, where, the, patient, is, fully, aware, that, the, treatment, is, inert, known, as, an, open, label, placebo, clinical, trials, found, that, open, label, placebos, may, have, positive, effects, in, comparison, to, no, treatment, which, may, open, new, avenues, for, treatments, but, a, review, of, such, trials, noted, that, they, were, done, with, a, small, number, of, participants, and, hence, should, be, interpreted, with, caution, until, further, better, controlled, trials, are, conducted, an, updated, 2021, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, based, on, 11, studies, also, found, a, significant, albeit, slightly, smaller, overall, effect, of, open, label, placebos, while, noting, that, research, on, olps, is, still, in, its, infancy, if, the, person, dispensing, the, placebo, shows, their, care, towards, the, patient, is, friendly, and, sympathetic, or, has, a, high, expectation, of, a, treatment, s, success, then, the, placebo, is, more, effectual, in, the, 2022, book, epigenetics, and, anticipation, published, by, springer, goli, integrates, many, of, the, specific, and, non, specific, factors, influencing, the, placebo, effect, in, the, perceived, healing, response, formula, developed, based, on, main, placebo, studies, in, 2008, a, meta, analysis, led, by, psychologist, irving, kirsch, analyzing, data, from, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, concluded, that, 82, of, the, response, to, antidepressants, was, accounted, for, by, placebos, however, other, authors, expressed, serious, doubts, about, the, used, methods, and, the, interpretation, of, the, results, especially, the, use, of, 0, 5, as, the, cut, off, point, for, the, effect, size, a, complete, reanalysis, and, recalculation, based, on, the, same, fda, data, found, that, the, kirsch, study, had, important, flaws, in, the, calculations, the, authors, concluded, that, although, a, large, percentage, of, the, placebo, response, was, due, to, expectancy, this, was, not, true, for, the, active, drug, besides, confirming, drug, effectiveness, they, found, that, the, drug, effect, was, not, related, to, depression, severity, another, meta, analysis, found, that, 79, of, depressed, patients, receiving, placebo, remained, well, for, 12, weeks, after, an, initial, 6, 8, weeks, of, successful, therapy, compared, to, 93, of, those, receiving, antidepressants, in, the, continuation, phase, however, patients, on, placebo, relapsed, significantly, more, often, than, patients, on, antidepressants, a, phenomenon, opposite, to, the, placebo, effect, has, also, been, observed, when, an, inactive, substance, or, treatment, is, administered, to, a, recipient, who, has, an, expectation, of, it, having, a, negative, impact, this, intervention, is, known, as, a, nocebo, latin, nocebo, i, shall, harm, a, nocebo, effect, occurs, when, the, recipient, of, an, inert, substance, reports, a, negative, effect, or, a, worsening, of, symptoms, with, the, outcome, resulting, not, from, the, substance, itself, but, from, negative, expectations, about, the, treatment, another, negative, consequence, is, that, placebos, can, cause, side, effects, associated, with, real, treatment, withdrawal, symptoms, can, also, occur, after, placebo, treatment, this, was, found, for, example, after, the, discontinuation, of, the, women, s, health, initiative, study, of, hormone, replacement, therapy, for, menopause, women, had, been, on, placebo, for, an, average, of, 5, 7, years, moderate, or, severe, withdrawal, symptoms, were, reported, by, 4, 8, of, those, on, placebo, compared, to, 21, 3, of, those, on, hormone, replacement, knowingly, giving, a, person, a, placebo, when, there, is, an, effective, treatment, available, is, a, bioethically, complex, issue, while, placebo, controlled, trials, might, provide, information, about, the, effectiveness, of, a, treatment, it, denies, some, patients, what, could, be, the, best, available, if, unproven, treatment, informed, consent, is, usually, required, for, a, study, to, be, considered, ethical, including, the, disclosure, that, some, test, subjects, will, receive, placebo, treatments, the, ethics, of, placebo, controlled, studies, have, been, debated, in, the, revision, process, of, the, declaration, of, helsinki, of, particular, concern, has, been, the, difference, between, trials, comparing, inert, placebos, with, experimental, treatments, versus, comparing, the, best, available, treatment, with, an, experimental, treatment, and, differences, between, trials, in, the, sponsor, s, developed, countries, versus, the, trial, s, targeted, developing, countries, some, suggest, that, existing, medical, treatments, should, be, used, instead, of, placebos, to, avoid, having, some, patients, not, receive, medicine, during, the, trial, the, practice, of, doctors, prescribing, placebos, that, are, disguised, as, real, medication, is, controversial, a, chief, concern, is, that, it, is, deceptive, and, could, harm, the, doctor, patient, relationship, in, the, long, run, while, some, say, that, blanket, consent, or, the, general, consent, to, unspecified, treatment, given, by, patients, beforehand, is, ethical, others, argue, that, patients, should, always, obtain, specific, information, about, the, name, of, the, drug, they, are, receiving, its, side, effects, and, other, treatment, options, this, view, is, shared, by, some, on, the, grounds, of, patient, autonomy, there, are, also, concerns, that, legitimate, doctors, and, pharmacists, could, open, themselves, up, to, charges, of, fraud, or, malpractice, by, using, a, placebo, critics, also, argued, that, using, placebos, can, delay, the, proper, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, serious, medical, conditions, despite, the, abovementioned, issues, 60, of, surveyed, physicians, and, head, nurses, reported, using, placebos, in, an, israeli, study, with, only, 5, of, respondents, stating, that, placebo, use, should, be, strictly, prohibited, a, british, medical, journal, editorial, said, that, a, patient, gets, pain, relief, from, a, placebo, does, not, imply, that, the, pain, is, not, real, or, organic, in, origin, the, use, of, the, placebo, for, diagnosis, of, whether, or, not, pain, is, real, is, misguided, a, survey, in, the, united, states, of, more, than, 10, 000, physicians, came, to, the, result, that, while, 24, of, physicians, would, prescribe, a, treatment, that, is, a, placebo, simply, because, the, patient, wanted, treatment, 58, would, not, and, for, the, remaining, 18, it, would, depend, on, the, circumstances, referring, specifically, to, homeopathy, the, house, of, commons, of, the, united, kingdom, science, and, technology, committee, has, stated, in, the, committee, s, view, homeopathy, is, a, placebo, treatment, and, the, government, should, have, a, policy, on, prescribing, placebos, the, government, is, reluctant, to, address, the, appropriateness, and, ethics, of, prescribing, placebos, to, patients, which, usually, relies, on, some, degree, of, patient, deception, prescribing, of, placebos, is, not, consistent, with, informed, patient, choice, which, the, government, claims, is, very, important, as, it, means, patients, do, not, have, all, the, information, needed, to, make, choice, meaningful, a, further, issue, is, that, the, placebo, effect, is, unreliable, and, unpredictable, in, his, 2008, book, bad, science, ben, goldacre, argues, that, instead, of, deceiving, patients, with, placebos, doctors, should, use, the, placebo, effect, to, enhance, effective, medicines, edzard, ernst, has, argued, similarly, that, as, a, good, doctor, you, should, be, able, to, transmit, a, placebo, effect, through, the, compassion, you, show, your, patients, in, an, opinion, piece, about, homeopathy, ernst, argues, that, it, is, wrong, to, support, alternative, medicine, on, the, basis, that, it, can, make, patients, feel, better, through, the, placebo, effect, his, concerns, are, that, it, is, deceitful, and, that, the, placebo, effect, is, unreliable, goldacre, also, concludes, that, the, placebo, effect, does, not, justify, alternative, medicine, arguing, that, unscientific, medicine, could, lead, to, patients, not, receiving, prevention, advice, placebo, researcher, fabrizio, benedetti, also, expresses, concern, over, the, potential, for, placebos, to, be, used, unethically, warning, that, there, is, an, increase, in, quackery, and, that, an, alternative, industry, that, preys, on, the, vulnerable, is, developing, the, mechanism, for, how, placebos, could, have, effects, is, uncertain, from, a, sociocognitive, perspective, intentional, placebo, response, is, attributed, to, the, ritual, effect, that, induces, anticipation, for, transition, to, a, better, state, a, placebo, presented, as, a, stimulant, may, trigger, an, effect, on, heart, rhythm, and, blood, pressure, but, when, administered, as, a, depressant, the, opposite, effect, in, psychology, the, two, main, hypotheses, of, the, placebo, effect, are, expectancy, theory, and, classical, conditioning, in, 1985, irving, kirsch, hypothesized, that, placebo, effects, are, produced, by, the, self, fulfilling, effects, of, response, expectancies, in, which, the, belief, that, one, will, feel, different, leads, a, person, to, actually, feel, different, according, to, this, theory, the, belief, that, one, has, received, an, active, treatment, can, produce, the, subjective, changes, thought, to, be, produced, by, the, real, treatment, similarly, the, appearance, of, effect, can, result, from, classical, conditioning, wherein, a, placebo, and, an, actual, stimulus, are, used, simultaneously, until, the, placebo, is, associated, with, the, effect, from, the, actual, stimulus, both, conditioning, and, expectations, play, a, role, in, placebo, effect, and, make, different, kinds, of, contributions, conditioning, has, a, longer, lasting, effect, and, can, affect, earlier, stages, of, information, processing, those, who, think, a, treatment, will, work, display, a, stronger, placebo, effect, than, those, who, do, not, as, evidenced, by, a, study, of, acupuncture, additionally, motivation, may, contribute, to, the, placebo, effect, the, active, goals, of, an, individual, changes, their, somatic, experience, by, altering, the, detection, and, interpretation, of, expectation, congruent, symptoms, and, by, changing, the, behavioral, strategies, a, person, pursues, motivation, may, link, to, the, meaning, through, which, people, experience, illness, and, treatment, such, meaning, is, derived, from, the, culture, in, which, they, live, and, which, informs, them, about, the, nature, of, illness, and, how, it, responds, to, treatment, functional, imaging, upon, placebo, analgesia, suggests, links, to, the, activation, and, increased, functional, correlation, between, this, activation, in, the, anterior, cingulate, prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and, insular, cortices, nucleus, accumbens, amygdala, the, brainstem, s, periaqueductal, gray, matter, and, the, spinal, cord, since, 1978, it, has, been, known, that, placebo, analgesia, depends, upon, the, release, of, endogenous, opioids, in, the, brain, such, analgesic, placebos, activation, changes, processing, lower, down, in, the, brain, by, enhancing, the, descending, inhibition, through, the, periaqueductal, gray, on, spinal, nociceptive, reflexes, while, the, expectations, of, anti, analgesic, nocebos, acts, in, the, opposite, way, to, block, this, functional, imaging, upon, placebo, analgesia, has, been, summarized, as, showing, that, the, placebo, response, is, mediated, by, top, down, processes, dependent, on, frontal, cortical, areas, that, generate, and, maintain, cognitive, expectancies, dopaminergic, reward, pathways, may, underlie, these, expectancies, diseases, lacking, major, top, down, or, cortically, based, regulation, may, be, less, prone, to, placebo, related, improvement, in, conditioning, a, neutral, stimulus, saccharin, is, paired, in, a, drink, with, an, agent, that, produces, an, unconditioned, response, for, example, that, agent, might, be, cyclophosphamide, which, causes, immunosuppression, after, learning, this, pairing, the, taste, of, saccharin, by, itself, is, able, to, cause, immunosuppression, as, a, new, conditioned, response, via, neural, top, down, control, such, conditioning, has, been, found, to, affect, a, diverse, variety, of, not, just, basic, physiological, processes, in, the, immune, system, but, ones, such, as, serum, iron, levels, oxidative, dna, damage, levels, and, insulin, secretion, recent, reviews, have, argued, that, the, placebo, effect, is, due, to, top, down, control, by, the, brain, for, immunity, and, pain, pacheco, l, pez, and, colleagues, have, raised, the, possibility, of, neocortical, sympathetic, immune, axis, providing, neuroanatomical, substrates, that, might, explain, the, link, between, placebo, conditioned, and, placebo, expectation, responses, 441, there, has, also, been, research, aiming, to, understand, underlying, neurobiological, mechanisms, of, action, in, pain, relief, immunosuppression, parkinson, s, disease, and, depression, dopaminergic, pathways, have, been, implicated, in, the, placebo, response, in, pain, and, depression, placebo, controlled, studies, as, well, as, studies, of, the, placebo, effect, itself, often, fail, to, adequately, identify, confounding, factors, false, impressions, of, placebo, effects, are, caused, by, many, factors, including, the, word, placebo, was, used, in, a, medicinal, context, in, the, late, 18th, century, to, describe, a, commonplace, method, or, medicine, and, in, 1811, it, was, defined, as, any, medicine, adapted, more, to, please, than, to, benefit, the, patient, although, this, definition, contained, a, derogatory, implication, it, did, not, necessarily, imply, that, the, remedy, had, no, effect, it, was, recognized, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, that, drugs, or, remedies, often, were, perceived, to, work, best, while, they, were, still, novel, we, know, that, in, paris, fashion, imposes, its, dictates, on, medicine, just, as, it, does, with, everything, else, well, at, one, time, pyramidal, elm, bark, had, a, great, reputation, it, was, taken, as, a, powder, as, an, extract, as, an, elixir, even, in, baths, it, was, good, for, the, nerves, the, chest, the, stomach, what, can, i, say, it, was, a, true, panacea, at, the, peak, of, the, fad, one, of, bouvard, s, patients, asked, him, if, it, might, not, be, a, good, idea, to, take, some, take, it, madame, he, replied, and, hurry, up, while, it, cures, placebos, have, featured, in, medical, use, until, well, into, the, twentieth, century, an, influential, 1955, study, entitled, the, powerful, placebo, firmly, established, the, idea, that, placebo, effects, were, clinically, important, and, were, a, result, of, the, brain, s, role, in, physical, health, a, 1997, reassessment, found, no, evidence, of, any, placebo, effect, in, the, source, data, as, the, study, had, not, accounted, for, regression, to, the, mean, the, placebo, effect, makes, it, more, difficult, to, evaluate, new, treatments, clinical, trials, control, for, this, effect, by, including, a, group, of, subjects, that, receives, a, sham, treatment, the, subjects, in, such, trials, are, blinded, as, to, whether, they, receive, the, treatment, or, a, placebo, if, a, person, is, given, a, placebo, under, one, name, and, they, respond, they, will, respond, in, the, same, way, on, a, later, occasion, to, that, placebo, under, that, name, but, not, if, under, another, clinical, trials, are, often, double, blinded, so, that, the, researchers, also, do, not, know, which, test, subjects, are, receiving, the, active, or, placebo, treatment, the, placebo, effect, in, such, clinical, trials, is, weaker, than, in, normal, therapy, since, the, subjects, are, not, sure, whether, the, treatment, they, are, receiving, is, active
