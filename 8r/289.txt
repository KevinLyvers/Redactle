ribosomes, r, a, b, z, o, m, s, o, m, are, macromolecular, machines, found, within, all, cells, that, perform, biological, protein, synthesis, messenger, rna, translation, ribosomes, link, amino, acids, together, in, the, order, specified, by, the, codons, of, messenger, rna, molecules, to, form, polypeptide, chains, ribosomes, consist, of, two, major, components, the, small, and, large, ribosomal, subunits, each, subunit, consists, of, one, or, more, ribosomal, rna, molecules, and, many, ribosomal, proteins, r, proteins, the, ribosomes, and, associated, molecules, are, also, known, as, the, translational, apparatus, the, sequence, of, dna, that, encodes, the, sequence, of, the, amino, acids, in, a, protein, is, transcribed, into, a, messenger, rna, mrna, chain, ribosomes, bind, to, messenger, rnas, and, use, their, sequences, to, determine, the, correct, sequence, of, amino, acids, to, generate, a, given, protein, amino, acids, are, selected, and, carried, to, the, ribosome, by, transfer, rna, trna, molecules, which, enter, the, ribosome, and, bind, to, the, messenger, rna, chain, via, an, anti, codon, stem, loop, for, each, coding, triplet, codon, in, the, messenger, rna, there, is, a, unique, transfer, rna, that, must, have, the, exact, anti, codon, match, and, carries, the, correct, amino, acid, for, incorporating, into, a, growing, polypeptide, chain, once, the, protein, is, produced, it, can, then, fold, to, produce, a, functional, three, dimensional, structure, a, ribosome, is, made, from, complexes, of, rnas, and, proteins, and, is, therefore, a, ribonucleoprotein, complex, in, prokaryotes, each, ribosome, is, composed, of, small, 30, s, and, large, 50, s, components, called, subunits, which, are, bound, to, each, other, the, synthesis, of, proteins, from, their, building, blocks, takes, place, in, four, phases, initiation, elongation, termination, and, recycling, the, start, codon, in, all, mrna, molecules, has, the, sequence, aug, the, stop, codon, is, one, of, uaa, uag, or, uga, since, there, are, no, trna, molecules, that, recognize, these, codons, the, ribosome, recognizes, that, translation, is, complete, when, a, ribosome, finishes, reading, an, mrna, molecule, the, two, subunits, separate, and, are, usually, broken, up, but, can, be, reused, ribosomes, are, a, kind, of, enzyme, called, ribozymes, because, the, catalytic, peptidyl, transferase, activity, that, links, amino, acids, together, is, performed, by, the, ribosomal, rna, in, eukaryotic, cells, ribosomes, are, often, associated, with, the, intracellular, membranes, that, make, up, the, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, ribosomes, from, bacteria, archaea, and, eukaryotes, in, the, three, domain, system, resemble, each, other, to, a, remarkable, degree, evidence, of, a, common, origin, they, differ, in, their, size, sequence, structure, and, the, ratio, of, protein, to, rna, the, differences, in, structure, allow, some, antibiotics, to, kill, bacteria, by, inhibiting, their, ribosomes, while, leaving, human, ribosomes, unaffected, in, all, species, more, than, one, ribosome, may, move, along, a, single, mrna, chain, at, one, time, as, a, polysome, each, reading, a, specific, sequence, and, producing, a, corresponding, protein, molecule, the, mitochondrial, ribosomes, of, eukaryotic, cells, are, distinct, from, their, other, ribosomes, they, functionally, resemble, those, in, bacteria, reflecting, the, evolutionary, origin, of, mitochondria, as, endosymbiotic, bacteria, ribosomes, were, first, observed, in, the, mid, 1950s, by, romanian, american, cell, biologist, george, emil, palade, using, an, electron, microscope, as, dense, particles, or, granules, they, were, initially, called, palade, granules, due, to, their, granular, structure, the, term, ribosome, was, proposed, in, 1958, by, howard, m, dintzis, during, the, course, of, the, symposium, a, semantic, difficulty, became, apparent, to, some, of, the, participants, microsomes, mean, the, ribonucleoprotein, particles, of, the, microsome, fraction, contaminated, by, other, protein, and, lipid, material, to, others, the, microsomes, consist, of, protein, and, lipid, contaminated, by, particles, the, phrase, microsomal, particles, does, not, seem, adequate, and, ribonucleoprotein, particles, of, the, microsome, fraction, is, much, too, awkward, during, the, meeting, the, word, ribosome, was, suggested, which, has, a, very, satisfactory, name, and, a, pleasant, sound, the, present, confusion, would, be, eliminated, if, ribosome, were, adopted, to, designate, ribonucleoprotein, particles, in, sizes, ranging, from, 35, to, 100s, albert, claude, christian, de, duve, and, george, emil, palade, were, jointly, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1974, for, the, discovery, of, the, ribosome, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, 2009, was, awarded, to, venkatraman, ramakrishnan, thomas, a, steitz, and, ada, e, yonath, for, determining, the, detailed, structure, and, mechanism, of, the, ribosome, the, ribosome, is, a, complex, cellular, machine, it, is, largely, made, up, of, specialized, rna, known, as, ribosomal, rna, rrna, as, well, as, dozens, of, distinct, proteins, the, exact, number, varies, slightly, between, species, the, ribosomal, proteins, and, rrnas, are, arranged, into, two, distinct, ribosomal, pieces, of, different, sizes, known, generally, as, the, large, and, small, subunits, of, the, ribosome, ribosomes, consist, of, two, subunits, that, fit, together, and, work, as, one, to, translate, the, mrna, into, a, polypeptide, chain, during, protein, synthesis, because, they, are, formed, from, two, subunits, of, non, equal, size, they, are, slightly, longer, on, the, axis, than, in, diameter, prokaryotic, ribosomes, are, around, 20, nm, 200, in, diameter, and, are, composed, of, 65, rrna, and, 35, ribosomal, proteins, eukaryotic, ribosomes, are, between, 25, and, 30, nm, 250, 300, in, diameter, with, an, rrna, to, protein, ratio, that, is, close, to, 1, crystallographic, work, has, shown, that, there, are, no, ribosomal, proteins, close, to, the, reaction, site, for, polypeptide, synthesis, this, suggests, that, the, protein, components, of, ribosomes, do, not, directly, participate, in, peptide, bond, formation, catalysis, but, rather, that, these, proteins, act, as, a, scaffold, that, may, enhance, the, ability, of, rrna, to, synthesize, protein, see, ribozyme, the, ribosomal, subunits, of, prokaryotes, and, eukaryotes, are, quite, similar, the, unit, of, measurement, used, to, describe, the, ribosomal, subunits, and, the, rrna, fragments, is, the, svedberg, unit, a, measure, of, the, rate, of, sedimentation, in, centrifugation, rather, than, size, this, accounts, for, why, fragment, names, do, not, add, up, for, example, bacterial, 70s, ribosomes, are, made, of, 50s, and, 30s, subunits, prokaryotes, have, 70, s, ribosomes, each, consisting, of, a, small, 30s, and, a, large, 50s, subunit, e, coli, for, example, has, a, 16s, rna, subunit, consisting, of, 1540, nucleotides, that, is, bound, to, 21, proteins, the, large, subunit, is, composed, of, a, 5s, rna, subunit, 120, nucleotides, a, 23s, rna, subunit, 2900, nucleotides, and, 31, proteins, affinity, label, for, the, trna, binding, sites, on, the, e, coli, ribosome, allowed, the, identification, of, a, and, p, site, proteins, most, likely, associated, with, the, peptidyltransferase, activity, labelled, proteins, are, l27, l14, l15, l16, l2, at, least, l27, is, located, at, the, donor, site, as, shown, by, e, collatz, and, a, p, czernilofsky, additional, research, has, demonstrated, that, the, s1, and, s21, proteins, in, association, with, the, 3, end, of, 16s, ribosomal, rna, are, involved, in, the, initiation, of, translation, archaeal, ribosomes, share, the, same, general, dimensions, of, bacteria, ones, being, a, 70s, ribosome, made, up, from, a, 50s, large, subunit, a, 30s, small, subunit, and, containing, three, rrna, chains, however, on, the, sequence, level, they, are, much, closer, to, eukaryotic, ones, than, to, bacterial, ones, every, extra, ribosomal, protein, archaea, have, compared, to, bacteria, has, a, eukaryotic, counterpart, while, no, such, relation, applies, between, archaea, and, bacteria, eukaryotes, have, 80s, ribosomes, located, in, their, cytosol, each, consisting, of, a, small, 40s, and, large, 60s, subunit, their, 40s, subunit, has, an, 18s, rna, 1900, nucleotides, and, 33, proteins, the, large, subunit, is, composed, of, a, 5s, rna, 120, nucleotides, 28s, rna, 4700, nucleotides, a, 5, 8s, rna, 160, nucleotides, subunits, and, 49, proteins, during, 1977, czernilofsky, published, research, that, used, affinity, labeling, to, identify, trna, binding, sites, on, rat, liver, ribosomes, several, proteins, including, l32, 33, l36, l21, l23, l28, 29, and, l13, were, implicated, as, being, at, or, near, the, peptidyl, transferase, center, in, eukaryotes, ribosomes, are, present, in, mitochondria, sometimes, called, mitoribosomes, and, in, plastids, such, as, chloroplasts, also, called, plastoribosomes, they, also, consist, of, large, and, small, subunits, bound, together, with, proteins, into, one, 70s, particle, these, ribosomes, are, similar, to, those, of, bacteria, and, these, organelles, are, thought, to, have, originated, as, symbiotic, bacteria, of, the, two, chloroplastic, ribosomes, are, closer, to, bacterial, ones, than, mitochondrial, ones, are, many, pieces, of, ribosomal, rna, in, the, mitochondria, are, shortened, and, in, the, case, of, 5s, rrna, replaced, by, other, structures, in, animals, and, fungi, in, particular, leishmania, tarentolae, has, a, minimalized, set, of, mitochondrial, rrna, in, contrast, plant, mitoribosomes, have, both, extended, rrna, and, additional, proteins, as, compared, to, bacteria, in, particular, many, pentatricopetide, repeat, proteins, the, cryptomonad, and, chlorarachniophyte, algae, may, contain, a, nucleomorph, that, resembles, a, vestigial, eukaryotic, nucleus, eukaryotic, 80s, ribosomes, may, be, present, in, the, compartment, containing, the, nucleomorph, the, differences, between, the, bacterial, and, eukaryotic, ribosomes, are, exploited, by, pharmaceutical, chemists, to, create, antibiotics, that, can, destroy, a, bacterial, infection, without, harming, the, cells, of, the, infected, person, due, to, the, differences, in, their, structures, the, bacterial, 70s, ribosomes, are, vulnerable, to, these, antibiotics, while, the, eukaryotic, 80s, ribosomes, are, not, even, though, mitochondria, possess, ribosomes, similar, to, the, bacterial, ones, mitochondria, are, not, affected, by, these, antibiotics, because, they, are, surrounded, by, a, double, membrane, that, does, not, easily, admit, these, antibiotics, into, the, organelle, a, noteworthy, counterexample, is, the, antineoplastic, antibiotic, chloramphenicol, which, inhibits, bacterial, 50s, and, eukaryotic, mitochondrial, 50s, ribosomes, ribosomes, in, chloroplasts, however, are, different, antibiotic, resistance, in, chloroplast, ribosomal, proteins, is, a, trait, that, has, to, be, introduced, as, a, marker, with, genetic, engineering, the, various, ribosomes, share, a, core, structure, which, is, quite, similar, despite, the, large, differences, in, size, much, of, the, rna, is, highly, organized, into, various, tertiary, structural, motifs, for, example, pseudoknots, that, exhibit, coaxial, stacking, the, extra, rna, in, the, larger, ribosomes, is, in, several, long, continuous, insertions, such, that, they, form, loops, out, of, the, core, structure, without, disrupting, or, changing, it, all, of, the, catalytic, activity, of, the, ribosome, is, carried, out, by, the, rna, the, proteins, reside, on, the, surface, and, seem, to, stabilize, the, structure, the, general, molecular, structure, of, the, ribosome, has, been, known, since, the, early, 1970s, in, the, early, 2000s, the, structure, has, been, achieved, at, high, resolutions, of, the, order, of, a, few, ngstr, ms, the, first, papers, giving, the, structure, of, the, ribosome, at, atomic, resolution, were, published, almost, simultaneously, in, late, 2000, the, 50s, large, prokaryotic, subunit, was, determined, from, the, archaeon, haloarcula, marismortui, and, the, bacterium, deinococcus, radiodurans, and, the, structure, of, the, 30s, subunit, was, determined, from, the, bacterium, thermus, thermophilus, these, structural, studies, were, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 2009, in, may, 2001, these, coordinates, were, used, to, reconstruct, the, entire, t, thermophilus, 70s, particle, at, 5, 5, resolution, two, papers, were, published, in, november, 2005, with, structures, of, the, escherichia, coli, 70s, ribosome, the, structures, of, a, vacant, ribosome, were, determined, at, 3, 5, resolution, using, x, ray, crystallography, then, two, weeks, later, a, structure, based, on, cryo, electron, microscopy, was, published, which, depicts, the, ribosome, at, 11, 15, resolution, in, the, act, of, passing, a, newly, synthesized, protein, strand, into, the, protein, conducting, channel, the, first, atomic, structures, of, the, ribosome, complexed, with, trna, and, mrna, molecules, were, solved, by, using, x, ray, crystallography, by, two, groups, independently, at, 2, 8, and, at, 3, 7, these, structures, allow, one, to, see, the, details, of, interactions, of, the, thermus, thermophilus, ribosome, with, mrna, and, with, trnas, bound, at, classical, ribosomal, sites, interactions, of, the, ribosome, with, long, mrnas, containing, shine, dalgarno, sequences, were, visualized, soon, after, that, at, 4, 5, 5, 5, resolution, in, 2011, the, first, complete, atomic, structure, of, the, eukaryotic, 80s, ribosome, from, the, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, was, obtained, by, crystallography, the, model, reveals, the, architecture, of, eukaryote, specific, elements, and, their, interaction, with, the, universally, conserved, core, at, the, same, time, the, complete, model, of, a, eukaryotic, 40s, ribosomal, structure, in, tetrahymena, thermophila, was, published, and, described, the, structure, of, the, 40s, subunit, as, well, as, much, about, the, 40s, subunit, s, interaction, with, eif1, during, translation, initiation, similarly, the, eukaryotic, 60s, subunit, structure, was, also, determined, from, tetrahymena, thermophila, in, complex, with, eif6, ribosomes, are, minute, particles, consisting, of, rna, and, associated, proteins, that, function, to, synthesize, proteins, proteins, are, needed, for, many, cellular, functions, such, as, repairing, damage, or, directing, chemical, processes, ribosomes, can, be, found, floating, within, the, cytoplasm, or, attached, to, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, their, main, function, is, to, convert, genetic, code, into, an, amino, acid, sequence, and, to, build, protein, polymers, from, amino, acid, monomers, ribosomes, act, as, catalysts, in, two, extremely, important, biological, processes, called, peptidyl, transfer, and, peptidyl, hydrolysis, the, pt, center, is, responsible, for, producing, protein, bonds, during, protein, elongation, in, summary, ribosomes, have, two, main, functions, decoding, the, message, and, the, formation, of, peptide, bonds, these, two, functions, reside, in, the, ribosomal, subunits, each, subunit, is, made, of, one, or, more, rrnas, and, many, r, proteins, the, small, subunit, 30s, in, bacteria, and, archaea, 40s, in, eukaryotes, has, the, decoding, function, whereas, the, large, subunit, 50s, in, bacteria, and, archaea, 60s, in, eukaryotes, catalyzes, the, formation, of, peptide, bonds, referred, to, as, the, peptidyl, transferase, activity, the, bacterial, and, archaeal, small, subunit, contains, the, 16s, rrna, and, 21, r, proteins, escherichia, coli, whereas, the, eukaryotic, small, subunit, contains, the, 18s, rrna, and, 32, r, proteins, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, although, the, numbers, vary, between, species, the, bacterial, large, subunit, contains, the, 5s, and, 23s, rrnas, and, 34, r, proteins, e, coli, with, the, eukaryotic, large, subunit, containing, the, 5s, 5, 8s, and, 25s, 28s, rrnas, and, 46, r, proteins, s, cerevisiae, again, the, exact, numbers, vary, between, species, ribosomes, are, the, workplaces, of, protein, biosynthesis, the, process, of, translating, mrna, into, protein, the, mrna, comprises, a, series, of, codons, which, are, decoded, by, the, ribosome, to, make, the, protein, using, the, mrna, as, a, template, the, ribosome, traverses, each, codon, 3, nucleotides, of, the, mrna, pairing, it, with, the, appropriate, amino, acid, provided, by, an, aminoacyl, trna, aminoacyl, trna, contains, a, complementary, anticodon, on, one, end, and, the, appropriate, amino, acid, on, the, other, for, fast, and, accurate, recognition, of, the, appropriate, trna, the, ribosome, utilizes, large, conformational, changes, conformational, proofreading, the, small, ribosomal, subunit, typically, bound, to, an, aminoacyl, trna, containing, the, first, amino, acid, methionine, binds, to, an, aug, codon, on, the, mrna, and, recruits, the, large, ribosomal, subunit, the, ribosome, contains, three, rna, binding, sites, designated, a, p, and, e, the, a, site, binds, an, aminoacyl, trna, or, termination, release, factors, the, p, site, binds, a, peptidyl, trna, a, trna, bound, to, the, poly, peptide, chain, and, the, e, site, exit, binds, a, free, trna, protein, synthesis, begins, at, a, start, codon, aug, near, the, 5, end, of, the, mrna, mrna, binds, to, the, p, site, of, the, ribosome, first, the, ribosome, recognizes, the, start, codon, by, using, the, shine, dalgarno, sequence, of, the, mrna, in, prokaryotes, and, kozak, box, in, eukaryotes, although, catalysis, of, the, peptide, bond, involves, the, c2, hydroxyl, of, rna, s, p, site, adenosine, in, a, proton, shuttle, mechanism, other, steps, in, protein, synthesis, such, as, translocation, are, caused, by, changes, in, protein, conformations, since, their, catalytic, core, is, made, of, rna, ribosomes, are, classified, as, ribozymes, and, it, is, thought, that, they, might, be, remnants, of, the, rna, world, in, figure, 5, both, ribosomal, subunits, small, and, large, assemble, at, the, start, codon, towards, the, 5, end, of, the, mrna, the, ribosome, uses, trna, that, matches, the, current, codon, triplet, on, the, mrna, to, append, an, amino, acid, to, the, polypeptide, chain, this, is, done, for, each, triplet, on, the, mrna, while, the, ribosome, moves, towards, the, 3, end, of, the, mrna, usually, in, bacterial, cells, several, ribosomes, are, working, parallel, on, a, single, mrna, forming, what, is, called, a, polyribosome, or, polysome, the, ribosome, is, known, to, actively, participate, in, the, protein, folding, the, structures, obtained, in, this, way, are, usually, identical, to, the, ones, obtained, during, protein, chemical, refolding, however, the, pathways, leading, to, the, final, product, may, be, different, in, some, cases, the, ribosome, is, crucial, in, obtaining, the, functional, protein, form, for, example, one, of, the, possible, mechanisms, of, folding, of, the, deeply, knotted, proteins, relies, on, the, ribosome, pushing, the, chain, through, the, attached, loop, presence, of, a, ribosome, quality, control, protein, rqc2, is, associated, with, mrna, independent, protein, elongation, this, elongation, is, a, result, of, ribosomal, addition, via, trnas, brought, by, rqc2, of, cat, tails, ribosomes, extend, the, c, terminus, of, a, stalled, protein, with, random, translation, independent, sequences, of, a, lanines, and, t, hreonines, ribosomes, are, classified, as, being, either, free, or, membrane, bound, free, and, membrane, bound, ribosomes, differ, only, in, their, spatial, distribution, they, are, identical, in, structure, whether, the, ribosome, exists, in, a, free, or, membrane, bound, state, depends, on, the, presence, of, an, er, targeting, signal, sequence, on, the, protein, being, synthesized, so, an, individual, ribosome, might, be, membrane, bound, when, it, is, making, one, protein, but, free, in, the, cytosol, when, it, makes, another, protein, ribosomes, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, organelles, but, the, use, of, the, term, organelle, is, often, restricted, to, describing, sub, cellular, components, that, include, a, phospholipid, membrane, which, ribosomes, being, entirely, particulate, do, not, for, this, reason, ribosomes, may, sometimes, be, described, as, non, membranous, organelles, free, ribosomes, can, move, about, anywhere, in, the, cytosol, but, are, excluded, from, the, cell, nucleus, and, other, organelles, proteins, that, are, formed, from, free, ribosomes, are, released, into, the, cytosol, and, used, within, the, cell, since, the, cytosol, contains, high, concentrations, of, glutathione, and, is, therefore, a, reducing, environment, proteins, containing, disulfide, bonds, which, are, formed, from, oxidized, cysteine, residues, cannot, be, produced, within, it, when, a, ribosome, begins, to, synthesize, proteins, that, are, needed, in, some, organelles, the, ribosome, making, this, protein, can, become, membrane, bound, in, eukaryotic, cells, this, happens, in, a, region, of, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, er, called, the, rough, er, the, newly, produced, polypeptide, chains, are, inserted, directly, into, the, er, by, the, ribosome, undertaking, vectorial, synthesis, and, are, then, transported, to, their, destinations, through, the, secretory, pathway, bound, ribosomes, usually, produce, proteins, that, are, used, within, the, plasma, membrane, or, are, expelled, from, the, cell, via, exocytosis, in, bacterial, cells, ribosomes, are, synthesized, in, the, cytoplasm, through, the, transcription, of, multiple, ribosome, gene, operons, in, eukaryotes, the, process, takes, place, both, in, the, cell, cytoplasm, and, in, the, nucleolus, which, is, a, region, within, the, cell, nucleus, the, assembly, process, involves, the, coordinated, function, of, over, 200, proteins, in, the, synthesis, and, processing, of, the, four, rrnas, as, well, as, assembly, of, those, rrnas, with, the, ribosomal, proteins, the, ribosome, may, have, first, originated, as, a, protoribosome, possibly, containing, a, peptidyl, transferase, centre, ptc, in, an, rna, world, appearing, as, a, self, replicating, complex, that, only, later, evolved, the, ability, to, synthesize, proteins, when, amino, acids, began, to, appear, studies, suggest, that, ancient, ribosomes, constructed, solely, of, rrna, could, have, developed, the, ability, to, synthesize, peptide, bonds, in, addition, evidence, strongly, points, to, ancient, ribosomes, as, self, replicating, complexes, where, the, rrna, in, the, ribosomes, had, informational, structural, and, catalytic, purposes, because, it, could, have, coded, for, trnas, and, proteins, needed, for, ribosomal, self, replication, hypothetical, cellular, organisms, with, self, replicating, rna, but, without, dna, are, called, ribocytes, or, ribocells, as, amino, acids, gradually, appeared, in, the, rna, world, under, prebiotic, conditions, their, interactions, with, catalytic, rna, would, increase, both, the, range, and, efficiency, of, function, of, catalytic, rna, molecules, thus, the, driving, force, for, the, evolution, of, the, ribosome, from, an, ancient, self, replicating, machine, into, its, current, form, as, a, translational, machine, may, have, been, the, selective, pressure, to, incorporate, proteins, into, the, ribosome, s, self, replicating, mechanisms, so, as, to, increase, its, capacity, for, self, replication, ribosomes, are, compositionally, heterogeneous, between, species, and, even, within, the, same, cell, as, evidenced, by, the, existence, of, cytoplasmic, and, mitochondria, ribosomes, within, the, same, eukaryotic, cells, certain, researchers, have, suggested, that, heterogeneity, in, the, composition, of, ribosomal, proteins, in, mammals, is, important, for, gene, regulation, i, e, the, specialized, ribosome, hypothesis, however, this, hypothesis, is, controversial, and, the, topic, of, ongoing, research, heterogeneity, in, ribosome, composition, was, first, proposed, to, be, involved, in, translational, control, of, protein, synthesis, by, vince, mauro, and, gerald, edelman, they, proposed, the, ribosome, filter, hypothesis, to, explain, the, regulatory, functions, of, ribosomes, evidence, has, suggested, that, specialized, ribosomes, specific, to, different, cell, populations, may, affect, how, genes, are, translated, some, ribosomal, proteins, exchange, from, the, assembled, complex, with, cytosolic, copies, suggesting, that, the, structure, of, the, in, vivo, ribosome, can, be, modified, without, synthesizing, an, entire, new, ribosome, certain, ribosomal, proteins, are, absolutely, critical, for, cellular, life, while, others, are, not, in, budding, yeast, 14, 78, ribosomal, proteins, are, non, essential, for, growth, while, in, humans, this, depends, on, the, cell, of, study, other, forms, of, heterogeneity, include, post, translational, modifications, to, ribosomal, proteins, such, as, acetylation, methylation, and, phosphorylation, arabidopsis, viral, internal, ribosome, entry, sites, iress, may, mediate, translations, by, compositionally, distinct, ribosomes, for, example, 40s, ribosomal, units, without, es25, in, yeast, and, mammalian, cells, are, unable, to, recruit, the, crpv, igr, ires, heterogeneity, of, ribosomal, rna, modifications, plays, a, significant, role, in, structural, maintenance, and, or, function, and, most, mrna, modifications, are, found, in, highly, conserved, regions, the, most, common, rrna, modifications, are, pseudouridylation, and, 2, o, methylation, of, ribose
