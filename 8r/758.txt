the, sea, otter, enhydra, lutris, is, a, marine, mammal, native, to, the, coasts, of, the, northern, and, eastern, north, pacific, ocean, adult, sea, otters, typically, weigh, between, 14, and, 45, kg, 30, and, 100, lb, making, them, the, heaviest, members, of, the, weasel, family, but, among, the, smallest, marine, mammals, unlike, most, marine, mammals, the, sea, otter, s, primary, form, of, insulation, is, an, exceptionally, thick, coat, of, fur, the, densest, in, the, animal, kingdom, although, it, can, walk, on, land, the, sea, otter, is, capable, of, living, exclusively, in, the, ocean, the, sea, otter, inhabits, nearshore, environments, where, it, dives, to, the, sea, floor, to, forage, it, preys, mostly, on, marine, invertebrates, such, as, sea, urchins, various, mollusks, and, crustaceans, and, some, species, of, fish, its, foraging, and, eating, habits, are, noteworthy, in, several, respects, its, use, of, rocks, to, dislodge, prey, and, to, open, shells, makes, it, one, of, the, few, mammal, species, to, use, tools, in, most, of, its, range, it, is, a, keystone, species, controlling, sea, urchin, populations, which, would, otherwise, inflict, extensive, damage, to, kelp, forest, ecosystems, its, diet, includes, prey, species, that, are, also, valued, by, humans, as, food, leading, to, conflicts, between, sea, otters, and, fisheries, sea, otters, whose, numbers, were, once, estimated, at, 150, 000, 300, 000, were, hunted, extensively, for, their, fur, between, 1741, and, 1911, and, the, world, population, fell, to, 1, 000, 2, 000, individuals, living, in, a, fraction, of, their, historic, range, a, subsequent, international, ban, on, hunting, sea, otter, conservation, efforts, and, reintroduction, programs, into, previously, populated, areas, have, contributed, to, numbers, rebounding, and, the, species, occupies, about, two, thirds, of, its, former, range, the, recovery, of, the, sea, otter, is, considered, an, important, success, in, marine, conservation, although, populations, in, the, aleutian, islands, and, california, have, recently, declined, or, have, plateaued, at, depressed, levels, for, these, reasons, the, sea, otter, remains, classified, as, an, endangered, species, the, sea, otter, is, the, heaviest, the, giant, otter, is, longer, but, significantly, slimmer, member, of, the, family, mustelidae, a, diverse, group, that, includes, the, 13, otter, species, and, terrestrial, animals, such, as, weasels, badgers, and, minks, it, is, unique, among, the, mustelids, in, not, making, dens, or, burrows, in, having, no, functional, anal, scent, glands, and, in, being, able, to, live, its, entire, life, without, leaving, the, water, the, only, living, member, of, the, genus, enhydra, the, sea, otter, is, so, different, from, other, mustelid, species, that, as, recently, as, 1982, some, scientists, believed, it, was, more, closely, related, to, the, earless, seals, genetic, analysis, indicates, the, sea, otter, and, its, closest, extant, relatives, which, include, the, african, speckle, throated, otter, eurasian, otter, african, clawless, otter, and, asian, small, clawed, otter, shared, an, ancestor, approximately, 5, million, years, ago, fossil, evidence, indicates, the, enhydra, lineage, became, isolated, in, the, north, pacific, approximately, 2, million, years, ago, giving, rise, to, the, now, extinct, enhydra, macrodonta, and, the, modern, sea, otter, enhydra, lutris, one, related, species, has, been, described, enhydra, reevei, from, the, pleistocene, of, east, anglia, the, modern, sea, otter, evolved, initially, in, northern, hokkaid, and, russia, and, then, spread, east, to, the, aleutian, islands, mainland, alaska, and, down, the, north, american, coast, in, comparison, to, cetaceans, sirenians, and, pinnipeds, which, entered, the, water, approximately, 50, 40, and, 20, million, years, ago, respectively, the, sea, otter, is, a, relative, newcomer, to, a, marine, existence, in, some, respects, though, the, sea, otter, is, more, fully, adapted, to, water, than, pinnipeds, which, must, haul, out, on, land, or, ice, to, give, birth, the, full, genome, of, the, northern, sea, otter, enhydra, lutris, kenyoni, was, sequenced, in, 2017, and, may, allow, for, examination, of, the, sea, otter, s, evolutionary, divergence, from, terrestrial, mustelids, pteronura, giant, otter, lontra, 4, species, enhydra, sea, otter, hydrictis, spotted, necked, otter, lutra, 2, species, aonyx, african, clawless, amblonyx, asian, small, clawed, lutrogale, smooth, coated, the, first, scientific, description, of, the, sea, otter, is, contained, in, the, field, notes, of, georg, steller, from, 1751, and, the, species, was, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, landmark, 1758, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, originally, named, lutra, marina, it, underwent, numerous, name, changes, before, being, accepted, as, enhydra, lutris, in, 1922, the, generic, name, enhydra, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, en, in, and, hydra, water, meaning, in, the, water, and, the, latin, word, lutris, meaning, otter, it, was, formerly, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, sea, beaver, three, subspecies, of, the, sea, otter, are, recognized, with, distinct, geographical, distributions, enhydra, lutris, lutris, nominate, the, asian, sea, otter, ranges, across, russia, s, kuril, islands, northeast, of, japan, and, the, commander, islands, in, the, northwestern, pacific, ocean, in, the, eastern, pacific, ocean, e, l, kenyoni, the, northern, sea, otter, is, found, from, alaska, s, aleutian, islands, to, oregon, and, e, l, nereis, the, southern, sea, otter, is, native, to, central, and, southern, california, the, asian, sea, otter, is, the, largest, subspecies, and, has, a, slightly, wider, skull, and, shorter, nasal, bones, than, both, other, subspecies, northern, sea, otters, possess, longer, mandibles, lower, jaws, while, southern, sea, otters, have, longer, rostrums, and, smaller, teeth, the, sea, otter, is, one, of, the, smallest, marine, mammal, species, but, it, is, the, heaviest, mustelid, male, sea, otters, usually, weigh, 22, to, 45, kg, 49, to, 99, lb, and, are, 1, 2, to, 1, 5, m, 3, ft, 11, in, to, 4, ft, 11, in, in, length, though, specimens, up, to, 54, kg, 119, lb, have, been, recorded, females, are, smaller, weighing, 14, to, 33, kg, 31, to, 73, lb, and, measuring, 1, 0, to, 1, 4, m, 3, ft, 3, in, to, 4, ft, 7, in, in, length, the, average, weight, for, adult, sea, otters, that, are, in, more, densely, populated, areas, at, 28, 3, kg, 62, lb, in, males, and, 21, 1, kg, 47, lb, in, females, was, considerably, lighter, than, the, average, weight, of, otters, in, more, sparse, populations, at, 39, 3, kg, 87, lb, in, males, and, 25, 2, kg, 56, lb, in, females, presumably, less, populous, otters, are, more, able, to, monopolize, food, sources, for, its, size, the, male, otter, s, baculum, is, very, large, massive, and, bent, upwards, measuring, 150, mm, 5, 7, 8, in, in, length, and, 15, mm, 9, 16, in, at, the, base, unlike, most, other, marine, mammals, the, sea, otter, has, no, blubber, and, relies, on, its, exceptionally, thick, fur, to, keep, warm, with, up, to, 150, 000, strands, of, hair, per, square, centimetre, 970, 000, in, 2, its, fur, is, the, densest, of, any, animal, the, fur, consists, of, long, waterproof, guard, hairs, and, short, underfur, the, guard, hairs, keep, the, dense, underfur, layer, dry, there, is, an, air, compartment, between, the, thick, fur, and, the, skin, where, air, is, trapped, and, heated, by, the, body, cold, water, is, kept, completely, away, from, the, skin, and, heat, loss, is, limited, however, a, potential, disadvantage, of, this, form, of, insulation, is, compression, of, the, air, layer, as, the, otter, dives, thereby, reducing, the, insulating, quality, of, fur, at, depth, when, the, animal, forages, the, fur, is, thick, year, round, as, it, is, shed, and, replaced, gradually, rather, than, in, a, distinct, molting, season, as, the, ability, of, the, guard, hairs, to, repel, water, depends, on, utmost, cleanliness, the, sea, otter, has, the, ability, to, reach, and, groom, the, fur, on, any, part, of, its, body, taking, advantage, of, its, loose, skin, and, an, unusually, supple, skeleton, the, coloration, of, the, pelage, is, usually, deep, brown, with, silver, gray, speckles, but, it, can, range, from, yellowish, or, grayish, brown, to, almost, black, in, adults, the, head, throat, and, chest, are, lighter, in, color, than, the, rest, of, the, body, the, sea, otter, displays, numerous, adaptations, to, its, marine, environment, the, nostrils, and, small, ears, can, close, the, hind, feet, which, provide, most, of, its, propulsion, in, swimming, are, long, broadly, flattened, and, fully, webbed, the, fifth, digit, on, each, hind, foot, is, longest, facilitating, swimming, while, on, its, back, but, making, walking, difficult, the, tail, is, fairly, short, thick, slightly, flattened, and, muscular, the, front, paws, are, short, with, retractable, claws, with, tough, pads, on, the, palms, that, enable, gripping, slippery, prey, the, bones, show, osteosclerosis, increasing, their, density, to, reduce, buoyancy, the, sea, otter, presents, an, insight, into, the, evolutionary, process, of, the, mammalian, invasion, of, the, aquatic, environment, which, has, occurred, numerous, times, over, the, course, of, mammalian, evolution, having, only, returned, to, the, sea, about, 3, million, years, ago, sea, otters, represent, a, snapshot, at, the, earliest, point, of, the, transition, from, fur, to, blubber, in, sea, otters, fur, is, still, advantageous, given, their, small, nature, and, division, of, lifetime, between, the, aquatic, and, terrestrial, environments, however, as, sea, otters, evolve, and, adapt, to, spending, more, and, more, of, their, lifetimes, in, the, sea, the, convergent, evolution, of, blubber, suggests, that, the, reliance, on, fur, for, insulation, would, be, replaced, by, a, dependency, on, blubber, this, is, particularly, true, due, to, the, diving, nature, of, the, sea, otter, as, dives, become, lengthier, and, deeper, the, air, layer, s, ability, to, retain, heat, or, buoyancy, decreases, while, blubber, remains, efficient, at, both, of, those, functions, blubber, can, also, additionally, serve, as, an, energy, source, for, deep, dives, which, would, most, likely, prove, advantageous, over, fur, in, the, evolutionary, future, of, sea, otters, the, sea, otter, propels, itself, underwater, by, moving, the, rear, end, of, its, body, including, its, tail, and, hind, feet, up, and, down, and, is, capable, of, speeds, of, up, to, 9, kilometres, per, hour, 5, 6, mph, when, underwater, its, body, is, long, and, streamlined, with, the, short, forelimbs, pressed, closely, against, the, chest, when, at, the, surface, it, usually, floats, on, its, back, and, moves, by, sculling, its, feet, and, tail, from, side, to, side, at, rest, all, four, limbs, can, be, folded, onto, the, torso, to, conserve, heat, whereas, on, particularly, hot, days, the, hind, feet, may, be, held, underwater, for, cooling, the, sea, otter, s, body, is, highly, buoyant, because, of, its, large, lung, capacity, about, 2, 5, times, greater, than, that, of, similar, sized, land, mammals, and, the, air, trapped, in, its, fur, the, sea, otter, walks, with, a, clumsy, rolling, gait, on, land, and, can, run, in, a, bounding, motion, long, highly, sensitive, whiskers, and, front, paws, help, the, sea, otter, find, prey, by, touch, when, waters, are, dark, or, murky, researchers, have, noted, when, they, approach, in, plain, view, sea, otters, react, more, rapidly, when, the, wind, is, blowing, towards, the, animals, indicating, the, sense, of, smell, is, more, important, than, sight, as, a, warning, sense, other, observations, indicate, the, sea, otter, s, sense, of, sight, is, useful, above, and, below, the, water, although, not, as, good, as, that, of, seals, its, hearing, is, neither, particularly, acute, nor, poor, an, adult, s, 32, teeth, particularly, the, molars, are, flattened, and, rounded, for, crushing, rather, than, cutting, food, seals, and, sea, otters, are, the, only, carnivores, with, two, pairs, of, lower, incisor, teeth, rather, than, three, the, adult, dental, formula, is, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, the, teeth, and, bones, are, sometimes, stained, purple, as, a, result, of, ingesting, sea, urchins, the, sea, otter, has, a, metabolic, rate, two, or, three, times, that, of, comparatively, sized, terrestrial, mammals, it, must, eat, an, estimated, 25, to, 38, of, its, own, body, weight, in, food, each, day, to, burn, the, calories, necessary, to, counteract, the, loss, of, heat, due, to, the, cold, water, environment, its, digestive, efficiency, is, estimated, at, 80, to, 85, and, food, is, digested, and, passed, in, as, little, as, three, hours, most, of, its, need, for, water, is, met, through, food, although, in, contrast, to, most, other, marine, mammals, it, also, drinks, seawater, its, relatively, large, kidneys, enable, it, to, derive, fresh, water, from, sea, water, and, excrete, concentrated, urine, the, sea, otter, is, diurnal, it, has, a, period, of, foraging, and, eating, in, the, morning, starting, about, an, hour, before, sunrise, then, rests, or, sleeps, in, mid, day, foraging, resumes, for, a, few, hours, in, the, afternoon, and, subsides, before, sunset, and, a, third, foraging, period, may, occur, around, midnight, females, with, pups, appear, to, be, more, inclined, to, feed, at, night, observations, of, the, amount, of, time, a, sea, otter, must, spend, each, day, foraging, range, from, 24, to, 60, apparently, depending, on, the, availability, of, food, in, the, area, sea, otters, spend, much, of, their, time, grooming, which, consists, of, cleaning, the, fur, untangling, knots, removing, loose, fur, rubbing, the, fur, to, squeeze, out, water, and, introduce, air, and, blowing, air, into, the, fur, to, casual, observers, it, appears, as, if, the, animals, are, scratching, but, they, are, not, known, to, have, lice, or, other, parasites, in, the, fur, when, eating, sea, otters, roll, in, the, water, frequently, apparently, to, wash, food, scraps, from, their, fur, the, sea, otter, hunts, in, short, dives, often, to, the, sea, floor, although, it, can, hold, its, breath, for, up, to, five, minutes, its, dives, typically, last, about, one, minute, and, not, more, than, four, minutes, it, is, the, only, marine, animal, capable, of, lifting, and, turning, over, rocks, which, it, often, does, with, its, front, paws, when, searching, for, prey, the, sea, otter, may, also, pluck, snails, and, other, organisms, from, kelp, and, dig, deep, into, underwater, mud, for, clams, it, is, the, only, marine, mammal, that, catches, fish, with, its, forepaws, rather, than, with, its, teeth, under, each, foreleg, the, sea, otter, has, a, loose, pouch, of, skin, that, extends, across, the, chest, in, this, pouch, preferentially, the, left, one, the, animal, stores, collected, food, to, bring, to, the, surface, this, pouch, also, holds, a, rock, unique, to, the, otter, that, is, used, to, break, open, shellfish, and, clams, at, the, surface, the, sea, otter, eats, while, floating, on, its, back, using, its, forepaws, to, tear, food, apart, and, bring, it, to, its, mouth, it, can, chew, and, swallow, small, mussels, with, their, shells, whereas, large, mussel, shells, may, be, twisted, apart, it, uses, its, lower, incisor, teeth, to, access, the, meat, in, shellfish, to, eat, large, sea, urchins, which, are, mostly, covered, with, spines, the, sea, otter, bites, through, the, underside, where, the, spines, are, shortest, and, licks, the, soft, contents, out, of, the, urchin, s, shell, the, sea, otter, s, use, of, rocks, when, hunting, and, feeding, makes, it, one, of, the, few, mammal, species, to, use, tools, to, open, hard, shells, it, may, pound, its, prey, with, both, paws, against, a, rock, on, its, chest, to, pry, an, abalone, off, its, rock, it, hammers, the, abalone, shell, using, a, large, stone, with, observed, rates, of, 45, blows, in, 15, seconds, releasing, an, abalone, which, can, cling, to, rock, with, a, force, equal, to, 4, 000, times, its, own, body, weight, requires, multiple, dives, although, each, adult, and, independent, juvenile, forages, alone, sea, otters, tend, to, rest, together, in, single, sex, groups, called, rafts, a, raft, typically, contains, 10, to, 100, animals, with, male, rafts, being, larger, than, female, ones, the, largest, raft, ever, seen, contained, over, 2000, sea, otters, to, keep, themselves, from, drifting, out, to, sea, when, resting, and, eating, sea, otters, may, wrap, themselves, in, kelp, a, male, sea, otter, is, most, likely, to, mate, if, he, maintains, a, breeding, territory, in, an, area, that, is, also, favored, by, females, as, autumn, is, the, peak, breeding, season, in, most, areas, males, typically, defend, their, territory, only, from, spring, to, autumn, during, this, time, males, patrol, the, boundaries, of, their, territories, to, exclude, other, males, although, actual, fighting, is, rare, adult, females, move, freely, between, male, territories, where, they, outnumber, adult, males, by, an, average, of, five, to, one, males, that, do, not, have, territories, tend, to, congregate, in, large, male, only, groups, and, swim, through, female, areas, when, searching, for, a, mate, the, species, exhibits, a, variety, of, vocal, behaviors, the, cry, of, a, pup, is, often, compared, to, that, of, a, gull, females, coo, when, they, are, apparently, content, males, may, grunt, instead, distressed, or, frightened, adults, may, whistle, hiss, or, in, extreme, circumstances, scream, although, sea, otters, can, be, playful, and, sociable, they, are, not, considered, to, be, truly, social, animals, they, spend, much, time, alone, and, each, adult, can, meet, its, own, hunting, grooming, and, defense, needs, sea, otters, are, polygynous, males, have, multiple, female, partners, typically, those, that, inhabit, their, territory, if, no, territory, is, established, they, seek, out, females, in, estrus, when, a, male, sea, otter, finds, a, receptive, female, the, two, engage, in, playful, and, sometimes, aggressive, behavior, they, bond, for, the, duration, of, estrus, or, 3, days, the, male, holds, the, female, s, head, or, nose, with, his, jaws, during, copulation, visible, scars, are, often, present, on, females, from, this, behavior, births, occur, year, round, with, peaks, between, may, and, june, in, northern, populations, and, between, january, and, march, in, southern, populations, gestation, appears, to, vary, from, four, to, twelve, months, as, the, species, is, capable, of, delayed, implantation, followed, by, four, months, of, pregnancy, in, california, sea, otters, usually, breed, every, year, about, twice, as, often, as, those, in, alaska, birth, usually, takes, place, in, the, water, and, typically, produces, a, single, pup, weighing, 1, 4, to, 2, 3, kilograms, 3, lb, 1, oz, to, 5, lb, 1, oz, twins, occur, in, 2, of, births, however, usually, only, one, pup, survives, at, birth, the, eyes, are, open, ten, teeth, are, visible, and, the, pup, has, a, thick, coat, of, baby, fur, mothers, have, been, observed, to, lick, and, fluff, a, newborn, for, hours, after, grooming, the, pup, s, fur, retains, so, much, air, the, pup, floats, like, a, cork, and, cannot, dive, the, fluffy, baby, fur, is, replaced, by, adult, fur, after, about, 13, weeks, nursing, lasts, six, to, eight, months, in, californian, populations, and, four, to, twelve, months, in, alaska, with, the, mother, beginning, to, offer, bits, of, prey, at, one, to, two, months, the, milk, from, a, sea, otter, s, two, abdominal, nipples, is, rich, in, fat, and, more, similar, to, the, milk, of, other, marine, mammals, than, to, that, of, other, mustelids, a, pup, with, guidance, from, its, mother, practices, swimming, and, diving, for, several, weeks, before, it, is, able, to, reach, the, sea, floor, initially, the, objects, it, retrieves, are, of, little, food, value, such, as, brightly, colored, starfish, and, pebbles, juveniles, are, typically, independent, at, six, to, eight, months, but, a, mother, may, be, forced, to, abandon, a, pup, if, she, cannot, find, enough, food, for, it, at, the, other, extreme, a, pup, may, be, nursed, until, it, is, almost, adult, size, pup, mortality, is, high, particularly, during, an, individual, s, first, winter, by, one, estimate, only, 25, of, pups, survive, their, first, year, pups, born, to, experienced, mothers, have, the, highest, survival, rates, females, perform, all, tasks, of, feeding, and, raising, offspring, and, have, occasionally, been, observed, caring, for, orphaned, pups, much, has, been, written, about, the, level, of, devotion, of, sea, otter, mothers, for, their, pups, a, mother, gives, her, infant, almost, constant, attention, cradling, it, on, her, chest, away, from, the, cold, water, and, attentively, grooming, its, fur, when, foraging, she, leaves, her, pup, floating, on, the, water, sometimes, wrapped, in, kelp, to, keep, it, from, floating, away, if, the, pup, is, not, sleeping, it, cries, loudly, until, she, returns, mothers, have, been, known, to, carry, their, pups, for, days, after, the, pups, deaths, females, become, sexually, mature, at, around, three, or, four, years, of, age, and, males, at, around, five, however, males, often, do, not, successfully, breed, until, a, few, years, later, a, captive, male, sired, offspring, at, age, 19, in, the, wild, sea, otters, live, to, a, maximum, age, of, 23, years, with, lifespans, ranging, from, 10, to, 15, years, for, males, and, 15, 20, years, for, females, several, captive, individuals, have, lived, past, 20, years, and, a, female, at, the, seattle, aquarium, named, etika, died, at, the, age, of, 28, years, sea, otters, in, the, wild, often, develop, worn, teeth, which, may, account, for, their, apparently, shorter, lifespans, sea, otters, live, in, coastal, waters, 15, to, 23, metres, 49, to, 75, ft, deep, and, usually, stay, within, a, kilometre, 2, 3, mi, of, the, shore, they, are, found, most, often, in, areas, with, protection, from, the, most, severe, ocean, winds, such, as, rocky, coastlines, thick, kelp, forests, and, barrier, reefs, although, they, are, most, strongly, associated, with, rocky, substrates, sea, otters, can, also, live, in, areas, where, the, sea, floor, consists, primarily, of, mud, sand, or, silt, their, northern, range, is, limited, by, ice, as, sea, otters, can, survive, amidst, drift, ice, but, not, land, fast, ice, individuals, generally, occupy, a, home, range, a, few, kilometres, long, and, remain, there, year, round, the, sea, otter, population, is, thought, to, have, once, been, 150, 000, to, 300, 000, stretching, in, an, arc, across, the, north, pacific, from, northern, japan, to, the, central, baja, california, peninsula, in, mexico, the, fur, trade, that, began, in, the, 1740s, reduced, the, sea, otter, s, numbers, to, an, estimated, 1, 000, to, 2, 000, members, in, 13, colonies, hunting, records, researched, by, historian, adele, ogden, place, the, westernmost, limit, of, the, hunting, grounds, off, the, northern, japanese, island, of, hokkaido, and, the, easternmost, limit, off, punta, morro, hermosa, about, 21, 1, 2, miles, 34, 6, km, south, of, punta, eugenia, baja, california, s, westernmost, headland, in, mexico, in, about, two, thirds, of, its, former, range, the, species, is, at, varying, levels, of, recovery, with, high, population, densities, in, some, areas, and, threatened, populations, in, others, sea, otters, currently, have, stable, populations, in, parts, of, the, russian, east, coast, alaska, british, columbia, washington, and, california, with, reports, of, recolonizations, in, mexico, and, japan, population, estimates, made, between, 2004, and, 2007, give, a, worldwide, total, of, approximately, 107, 000, sea, otters, adele, ogden, wrote, in, the, california, sea, otter,

northern, japan, where, the, country, s, only, confirmed, population, of, western, sea, otter, resides, sightings, have, been, documented, in, the, waters, of, cape, nosappu, erimo, hamanaka, and, nemuro, among, other, locations, in, the, region, currently, the, most, stable, and, secure, part, of, the, western, sea, otter, s, range, is, along, the, russian, far, east, coastline, in, the, northwestern, pacific, waters, off, of, the, country, namely, kamchatka, and, sakhalin, island, occasionally, being, seen, in, and, around, the, sea, of, okhotsk, before, the, 19th, century, around, 20, 000, to, 25, 000, sea, otters, lived, near, the, kuril, islands, with, more, near, kamchatka, and, the, commander, islands, after, the, years, of, the, great, hunt, the, population, in, these, areas, currently, part, of, russia, was, only, 750, by, 2004, sea, otters, had, repopulated, all, of, their, former, habitat, in, these, areas, with, an, estimated, total, population, of, about, 27, 000, of, these, about, 19, 000, are, at, the, kurils, 2, 000, to, 3, 500, at, kamchatka, and, another, 5, 000, to, 5, 500, at, the, commander, islands, growth, has, slowed, slightly, suggesting, the,

island, into, the, 20th, century, but, it, died, out, despite, the, 1911, international, protection, treaty, with, the, last, sea, otter, taken, near, kyuquot, in, 1929, from, 1969, to, 1972, 89, sea, otters, were, flown, or, shipped, from, alaska, to, the, west, coast, of, vancouver, island, this, population, increased, to, over, 5, 600, in, 2013, with, an, estimated, annual, growth, rate, of, 7, 2, and, their, range, on, the, island, s, west, coast, extended, north, to, cape, scott, and, across, the, queen, charlotte, strait, to, the, broughton, archipelago, and, south, to, clayoquot, sound, and, tofino, in, 1989, a, separate, colony, was, discovered, in, the, central, british, columbia, coast, it, is, not, known, if, this, colony, which, numbered, about, 300, animals, in, 2004, was, founded, by, transplanted, otters, or, was, a, remnant, population, that, had, gone, undetected, by, 2013, this, population, exceeded, 1, 100, individuals, was, increasing, at, an, estimated, 12, 6,

alaska, is, the, central, area, of, the, sea, otter, s, range, in, 1973, the, population, in, alaska, was, estimated, at, between, 100, 000, and, 125, 000, animals, by, 2006, though, the, alaska, population, had, fallen, to, an, estimated, 73, 000, animals, a, massive, decline, in, sea, otter, populations, in, the, aleutian, islands, accounts, for, most, of, the, change, the, cause, of, this, decline, is, not, known, although, orca, predation, is, suspected, the, sea, otter, population, in, prince, william, sound, was, also, hit, hard, by, the, exxon, valdez, oil, spill, which, killed, thousands, of, sea, otters, in, 1989, in, 1969, and, 1970, 59, sea, otters, were, translocated, from, amchitka, island, to, washington, and, released, near, la, push, and, point, grenville, the, translocated, population, is, estimated, to, have, declined, to, between, 10, and, 43, individuals, before, increasing, reaching, 208, individuals, in, 1989, as, of, 2017, the, population, was,

sightings, of, sea, otters, in, the, san, juan, islands, and, puget, sound, almost, always, turn, out, to, be, north, american, river, otters, which, are, commonly, seen, along, the, seashore, however, biologists, have, confirmed, isolated, sightings, of, sea, otters, in, these, areas, since, the, mid, 1990s, the, last, native, sea, otter, in, oregon, was, probably, shot, and, killed, in, 1906, in, 1970, and, 1971, a, total, of, 95, sea, otters, were, transplanted, from, amchitka, island, alaska, to, the, southern, oregon, coast, however, this, translocation, effort, failed, and, otters, soon, again, disappeared, from, the, state, in, 2004, a, male, sea, otter, took, up, residence, at, simpson, reef, off, of, cape, arago, for, six, months, this, male, is, thought, to, have, originated, from, a, colony, in, washington, but, disappeared, after, a, coastal, storm, on, 18, february, 2009, a, male, sea, otter, was, spotted, in, depoe, bay, off, the, oregon, coast, it, could, have, traveled, to, the, state, from, either, california, or, washington, the, historic, population, of, california, sea, otters, was, estimated, at, 16, 000, before, the, fur, trade, decimated, the,

shooting, them, while, hunting, sea, otters, in, the, estuaries, of, san, jose, san, mateo, san, bruno, and, around, angel, island, the, founder, of, fort, ross, ivan, kuskov, finding, otters, scarce, on, his, second, voyage, to, bodega, bay, in, 1812, sent, a, party, of, aleuts, to, san, francisco, bay, where, they, met, another, russian, party, and, an, american, party, and, caught, 1, 160, sea, otters, in, three, months, by, 1817, sea, otters, in, the, area, were, practically, eliminated, and, the, russians, sought, permission, from, the, spanish, and, the, mexican, governments, to, hunt, further, and, further, south, of, san, francisco, in, 1833, fur, trappers, george, nidever, and, george, yount, canoed, along, the, petaluma, side, of, bay, and, then, proceeded, to, the, san, joaquin, river, returning, with, sea, otter, beaver, and, river, otter, pelts, remnant, sea, otter, populations, may, have, survived, in, the, bay, until, 1840, when, the, rancho, punta, de, quentin, was, granted, to, captain, john, b, r, cooper, a, sea, captain, from, boston, by, mexican, governor, juan, bautista, alvarado, along, with, a, license, to, hunt, sea, otters, reportedly, then, prevalent, at, the, mouth, of, corte, madera, creek, in, the, late, 1980s, the, usfws, relocated, about, 140, southern, sea, otters, to, san, nicolas, island, in, southern, california, in, the, hope, of, establishing, a, reserve, population, should, the, mainland, be, struck, by, an, oil, spill, to, the, surprise, of, biologists, the, majority, of, the, san, nicolas, sea, otters, swam, back, to, the, mainland, another, group, of, twenty, swam, 74, miles, 119, km, north, to, san, miguel, island, where, they, were, captured, and, removed, by, 2005, only, 30, sea, otters, remained, at, san, nicolas, although, they, were, slowly, increasing, as, they, thrived, on, the, abundant, prey, around, the, island, the, plan, that, authorized, the, translocation, program, had, predicted, the, carrying, capacity, would, be, reached, within, five, to, 10, years, the, spring, 2016, count, at, san, nicolas, island, was, 104, sea, otters, continuing, a, 5, year, positive, trend, of, over, 12, per, year, sea, otters, were, observed, twice, in, southern, california, in, 2011, once, near, laguna, beach, and, once, at, zuniga, point, jetty, near, san, diego, these, are, the, first, documented, sightings, of, otters, this, far, south, in, 30, years, when, the, usfws, implemented, the, translocation, program, it, also, attempted, in, 1986, to, implement, zonal, management, of, the, californian, population, to, manage, the, competition, between, sea, otters, and, fisheries, it, declared, an, otter, free, zone, stretching, from, point, conception, to, the, mexican, border, in, this, zone, only, san, nicolas, island, was, designated, as, sea, otter, habitat, and, sea, otters, found, elsewhere, in, the, area, were, supposed, to, be, captured, and, relocated, these, plans, were, abandoned, after, many, translocated, otters, died, and, also, as, it, proved, impractical, to, capture, the, hundreds, of, otters, which, ignored, regulations, and, swam, into, the, zone, however, after, engaging, in, a, period, of, public, commentary, in, 2005, the, fish, and, wildlife, service, failed, to, release, a, formal, decision, on, the, issue, then, in, response, to, lawsuits, filed, by, the, santa, barbara, based, environmental, defense, center, and, the, otter, project, on, 19, december, 2012, the, usfws, declared, that, the, no, otter, zone, experiment, was, a, failure, and, will, protect, the, otters, re, colonizing, the, coast, south, of, point, conception, as, threatened, species, although, abalone, fisherman, blamed, the, incursions, of, sea, otters, for, the, decline, of, abalone, commercial, abalone, fishing, in, southern, california, came, to, an, end, from, overfishing, in, 1997, years, before, significant, otter, moved, south, of, point,

invertebrate, to, be, federally, listed, as, endangered, although, the, southern, sea, otter, s, range, has, continuously, expanded, from, the, remnant, population, of, about, 50, individuals, in, big, sur, since, protection, in, 1911, from, 2007, to, 2010, the, otter, population, and, its, range, contracted, and, since, 2010, has, made, little, progress, as, of, spring, 2010, the, northern, boundary, had, moved, from, about, tunitas, creek, to, a, point, 2, kilometres, 1, 2, mi, southeast, of, pigeon, point, and, the, southern, boundary, has, moved, along, the, gaviota, coast, from,

20th, century, through, the, early, 2000s, then, remained, relatively, flat, from, 2005, to, 2014, at, just, under, 3, 000, there, was, some, contraction, from, the, northern, now, pigeon, point, and, southern, limits, of, the, sea, otter, s, range, during, the, end, of, this, period, circumstantially, related, to, an, increase, in, lethal, shark, bites, raising, concerns, that, the, population, had, reached, a, plateau, however, the, population, increased, markedly, from, 2015, to, 2016, with, the, united, states, geological, survey, usgs, california, sea, otter, survey, 3, year, average, reaching, 3, 272, in, 2016, the, first, time, it, exceeded, the, threshold, for, delisting, from, the, endangered, species, act, esa, if, populations, continued, to, grow, and, esa, delisting,

were, reported, by, local, fishermen, but, scientists, could, not, confirm, these, accounts, however, male, and, female, otters, have, been, confirmed, by, scientists, off, shores, of, the, baja, peninsula, in, a, 2014, study, who, hypothesize, that, otter, dispersed, there, beginning, in, 2005, these, sea, otters, may, have, dispersed, from, san, nicolas, island, which, is, 300, kilometres, 190, mi, away, as, individuals, have, been, recorded, traversing, distances, of, over, 800, kilometres, 500, mi, genetic, analysis, of, most, of, these, animals, were, consistent, with, california, i, e, united, states, otter, origins, however, one, otter, had, a, haplotype, not, previously, reported, and, could, represent, a, remnant, of, the, original, native, mexican, otter, population, high, energetic, requirements, of, sea, otter, metabolism, require, them, to, consume, at, least, 20, of, their, body, weight, a, day, surface, swimming, and, foraging, are, major, factors, in, their, high, energy, expenditure, due, to, drag, on, the, surface, of, the, water, when, swimming, and, the, thermal, heat, loss, from, the, body, during, deep, dives, when, foraging, sea, otter, muscles, are, specially, adapted, to, generate, heat, without, physical, activity, sea, otters, are, apex, predators, that, consume, over, 100, prey, species, in, most, of, its, range, the, sea, otter, s, diet, consists, almost, exclusively, of, marine, benthic, invertebrates, including, sea, urchins, such, as, strongylocentrotus, franciscanus, and, s, purpuratus, sea, cucumbers, fat, innkeeper, worms, crustaceans, a, variety, of, mollusks, such, as, chitons, such, as, katharina, tunicata, snails, such, as, abalones, and, limpets, such, as, diodora, aspera, and, bivalves, such, as, clams, mussels, such, as, mytilus, edulis, and, scallops, such, as, crassadoma, gigantea, its, prey, ranges, in, size, from, tiny, limpets, and, crabs, to, giant, octopuses, where, prey, such, as, sea, urchins, clams, and, abalone, are, present, in, a, range, of, sizes, sea, otters, tend, to, select, larger, items, over, smaller, ones, of, similar, type, in, california, they, have, been, noted, to, ignore,

changes, over, time, as, sea, otters, can, significantly, deplete, populations, of, highly, preferred, prey, such, as, large, sea, urchins, and, prey, availability, is, also, affected, by, other, factors, such, as, fishing, by, humans, sea, otters, can, thoroughly, remove, abalone, from, an, area, except, for, specimens, in, deep, rock, crevices, however, they, never, completely, wipe, out, a,

scale, hunting, part, of, the, maritime, fur, trade, which, would, eventually, kill, approximately, one, million, sea, otters, began, in, the, 18th, century, when, hunters, and, traders, began, to, arrive, from, all, over, the, world, to, meet, foreign, demand, for, otter, pelts, which, were, one, of, the, world, s, most, valuable, types, of, fur, in, the, early, 18th, century, russians, began, to, hunt, sea, otters, in, the, kuril, islands, and, sold, them, to, the, chinese, at, kyakhta, russia, was, also, exploring, the, far, northern, pacific, at, this, time, and, sent, vitus, bering, to, map, the, arctic, coast, and, find, routes, from, siberia, to, north, america, in, 1741, on, his, second, north, pacific, voyage, bering, was, shipwrecked, off, bering, island, in, the, commander, islands, where, he, and, many, of, his, crew, died, the, surviving, crew, members, which, included, naturalist, georg, steller, discovered, sea, otters, on, the, beaches, of, the, island, and, spent, the, winter, hunting, sea, otters, and, gambling, with, otter, pelts, they, returned, to, siberia, having, killed, nearly, 1, 000, sea, otters, and, were, able, to, command, high, prices, for, the, pelts, thus, began, what, is, sometimes, called, the, great, hunt, which, would, continue, for, another, hundred, years, the, russians, found, the, sea, otter, far, more, valuable, than, the, sable, skins, that, had, driven, and, paid, for, most, of, their, expansion, across, siberia, if, the, sea, otter, pelts, brought, back, by, bering, s, survivors, had, been, sold, at, kyakhta, prices, they, would, have, paid, for, one, tenth, the, cost, of, bering, s, expedition, russian, fur, hunting, expeditions, soon, depleted, the, sea, otter, populations, in, the, commander, islands, and, by, 1745, they, began, to, move, on, to, the, aleutian, islands, the, russians, initially, traded, with, the, aleuts, inhabitants, of, these, islands, for, otter, pelts, but, later, enslaved, the, aleuts, taking, women, and, children, hostage, and, torturing, and, killing, aleut, men, to, force, them, to, hunt, many, aleuts, were, either, murdered, by, the, russians, or, died, from, diseases, the, hunters, had, introduced, the, aleut, population, was, reduced, by, the, russians, own, estimate, from, 20, 000, to, 2, 000, by, the, 1760s, the, russians, had, reached, alaska, in, 1799, tsar, paul,

territorial, acquisition, under, aleksander, i, the, administration, of, the, merchant, controlled, company, was, transferred, to, the, imperial, navy, largely, due, to, the, alarming, reports, by, naval, officers, of, native, abuse, in, 1818, the, indigenous, peoples, of, alaska, were, granted, civil, rights, equivalent, to, a, townsman, status, in, the, russian, empire, other, nations, joined, in, the, hunt, in, the, south, along, the, coasts, of, what, is, now, mexico, and, california, spanish, explorers, bought, sea, otter, pelts, from, native, americans, and, sold, them, in, asia, in,

the, pelts, rapidly, sold, at, high, prices, and, were, soon, known, as, soft, gold, as, word, spread, people, from, all, over, europe, and, north, america, began, to, arrive, in, the, pacific, northwest, to, trade, for, sea, otter, furs, russian, hunting, expanded, to, the, south, initiated, by, american, ship, captains, who, subcontracted, russian, supervisors, and, aleut, hunters, in, what, are, now, washington, oregon, and, california, between, 1803, and, 1846, 72, american, ships, were, involved, in, the, otter, hunt, in, california, harvesting, an, estimated, 40, 000, skins, and, tails, compared, to, only, 13, ships, of, the, russian, american, company, which, reported, 5, 696, otter, skins, taken, between, 1806, and, 1846, in, 1812, the, russians, founded, an, agricultural, settlement, at, what, is, now, fort, ross, in, northern, california, as, their, southern, headquarters, eventually, sea, otter, populations, became, so, depleted, commercial, hunting, was, no, longer, viable, it, had, stopped, in, the, aleutian, islands, by, 1808, as, a, conservation, measure, imposed, by, the, russian, american, company, further, restrictions, were, ordered, by, the, company, in, 1834, when, russia, sold, alaska, to, the, united, states, in, 1867, the, alaska, population, had, recovered, to, over, 100, 000, but, americans, resumed, hunting, and, quickly, extirpated, the, sea, otter, again, prices, rose, as, the, species, became, rare, during, the, 1880s, a, pelt, brought, 105, to, 165, in, the, london, market, but, by, 1903, a, pelt, could, be, worth, as, much, as, 1, 125, in, 1911, russia, japan, great, britain, for, canada, and, the, united, states, signed, the, treaty, for, the, preservation, and, protection, of, fur, seals, imposing, a, moratorium, on, the, harvesting, of, sea, otters, so, few, remained, perhaps, only, 1, 000, 2, 000, individuals, in, the, wild, that, many, believed, the, species, would, become, extinct, during, the, 20th, century, sea, otter, numbers, rebounded, in, about, two, thirds, of, their, historic, range, a, recovery, considered, one, of, the, greatest, successes, in, marine, conservation, however, the, iucn, still, lists, the, sea, otter, as, an, endangered, species, and, describes, the, significant, threats, to, sea, otters, as, oil, pollution, predation, by, orcas, poaching, and, conflicts, with, fisheries, sea, otters, can, drown, if, entangled, in, fishing, gear, the, hunting, of, sea, otters, is, no, longer, legal, except, for, limited, harvests, by, indigenous, peoples, in, the, united, states, poaching, was, a, serious, concern, in, the, russian, far, east, immediately, after, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, however, it, has, declined, significantly, with, stricter, law, enforcement, and, better, economic, conditions, the, most, significant, threat, to, sea, otters, is, oil, spills, to, which, they, are, particularly, vulnerable, since, they, rely, on, their, fur, to, keep, warm, when, their, fur, is, soaked, with, oil, it, loses, its, ability, to, retain, air, and, the, animals, can, quickly, die, from, hypothermia, the, liver, kidneys, and, lungs, of, sea, otters, also, become, damaged, after, they, inhale, oil, or, ingest, it, when, grooming, the, exxon, valdez, oil, spill, of, 24, march, 1989, killed, thousands, of, sea, otters, in, prince, william, sound, and, as, of, 2006, the, lingering, oil, in, the, area, continues, to, affect, the, population, describing, the, public, sympathy, for, sea, otters, that, developed, from, media, coverage, of, the, event, a, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, spokesperson, wrote, as, a, playful, photogenic, innocent, bystander, the, sea, otter, epitomized, the, role, of, victim, cute, and, frolicsome, sea, otters, suddenly, in, distress, oiled, frightened, and, dying, in, a, losing, battle, with, the, oil, the, small, geographic, ranges, of, the, sea, otter, populations, in, california, washington, and, british, columbia, mean, a, single, major, spill, could, be, catastrophic, for, that, state, or, province, prevention, of, oil, spills, and, preparation, to, rescue, otters, if, one, happens, is, a, major, focus, for, conservation, efforts, increasing, the, size, and, range, of, sea, otter, populations, would, also, reduce, the, risk, of, an, oil, spill, wiping, out, a, population, however, because, of, the, species, reputation, for, depleting, shellfish, resources, advocates, for, commercial, recreational, and, subsistence, shellfish, harvesting, have, often, opposed, allowing, the, sea, otter, s, range, to, increase, and, there, have, even, been, instances, of, fishermen, and, others, illegally, killing, them, in, the, aleutian, islands, a, massive, and, unexpected, disappearance, of, sea, otters, has, occurred, in, recent, decades, in, the, 1980s, the, area, was, home, to, an, estimated, 55, 000, to, 100, 000, sea, otters, but, the, population, fell, to, around, 6, 000, animals, by, 2000, the, most, widely, accepted, but, still, controversial, hypothesis, is, that, killer, whales, have, been, eating, the, otters, the, pattern, of, disappearances, is, consistent, with, a, rise, in, predation, but, there, has, been, no, direct, evidence, of, orcas, preying, on, sea, otters, to, any, significant, extent, another, area, of, concern, is, california, where, recovery, began, to, fluctuate, or, decline, in, the, late, 1990s, unusually, high, mortality, rates, amongst, adult, and, subadult, otters, particularly, females, have, been, reported, in, 2017, the, us, geological, survey, found, a, 3, drop, in, the, sea, otter, population, of, the, california, coast, this, number, still, keeps, them, on, track, for, removal, from, the, endangered, species, list, although, just, barely, necropsies, of, dead, sea, otters, indicate, diseases, particularly, toxoplasma, gondii, and, acanthocephalan, parasite, infections, are, major, causes, of, sea, otter, mortality, in, california, the, toxoplasma, gondii, parasite, which, is, often, fatal, to, sea, otters, is, carried, by, wild, and, domestic, cats, and, may, be, transmitted, by, domestic, cat, droppings, flushed, into, the, ocean, via, sewage, systems, although, disease, has, clearly, contributed, to, the, deaths, of, many, of, california, s, sea, otters, it, is, not, known, why, the, california, population, is, apparently, more, affected, by, disease, than, populations, in, other, areas, sea, otter, habitat, is, preserved, through, several, protected, areas, in, the, united, states, russia, and, canada, in, marine, protected, areas, polluting, activities, such, as, dumping, of, waste, and, oil, drilling, are, typically, prohibited, an, estimated, 1, 200, sea, otters, live, within, the, monterey, bay, national, marine, sanctuary, and, more, than, 500, live, within, the, olympic, coast, national, marine, sanctuary, some, of, the, sea, otter, s, preferred, prey, species, particularly, abalone, clams, and, crabs, are, also, food, sources, for, humans, in, some, areas, massive, declines, in, shellfish, harvests, have, been, blamed, on, the, sea, otter, and, intense, public, debate, has, taken, place, over, how, to, manage, the, competition, between, sea, otters, and, humans, for, seafood, the, debate, is, complicated, because, sea, otters, have, sometimes, been, held, responsible, for, declines, of, shellfish, stocks, that, were, more, likely, caused, by, overfishing, disease, pollution, and, seismic, activity, shellfish, declines, have, also, occurred, in, many, parts, of, the, north, american, pacific, coast, that, do, not, have, sea, otters, and, conservationists, sometimes, note, the, existence, of, large, concentrations, of, shellfish, on, the, coast, is, a, recent, development, resulting, from, the, fur, trade, s, near, extirpation, of, the, sea, otter, although, many, factors, affect, shellfish, stocks, sea, otter, predation, can, deplete, a, fishery, to, the, point, where, it, is, no, longer, commercially, viable, scientists, agree, that, sea, otters, and, abalone, fisheries, cannot, exist, in, the, same, area, and, the, same, is, likely, true, for, certain, other, types, of, shellfish, as, well, many, facets, of, the, interaction, between, sea, otters, and, the, human, economy, are, not, as, immediately, felt, sea, otters, have, been, credited, with, contributing, to, the, kelp, harvesting, industry, via, their, well, known, role, in, controlling, sea, urchin, populations, kelp, is, used, in, the, production, of, diverse, food, and, pharmaceutical, products, although, human, divers, harvest, red, sea, urchins, both, for, food, and, to, protect, the, kelp, sea, otters, hunt, more, sea, urchin, species, and, are, more, consistently, effective, in, controlling, these, populations, e, lutris, is, a, controlling, predator, of, the, red, king, crab, paralithodes, camtschaticus, in, the, bering, sea, which, would, otherwise, be, out, of, control, as, it, is, in, its, invasive, range, the, barents, sea, berents, otters, lutra, lutra, occupy, the, same, ecological, niche, and, so, are, believed, to, help, to, control, them, in, the, berents, but, this, has, not, been, studied, the, health, of, the, kelp, forest, ecosystem, is, significant, in, nurturing, populations, of, fish,

any, case, greatly, depleted, no, longer, rely, as, intimately, on, sea, mammals, for, survival, since, the, mid, 1970s, the, beauty, and, charisma, of, the, species, have, gained, wide, appreciation,

other, conservation, efforts, are, done, through, reintroduction, and, zoological, parks, a, principal, target, of, the, fur, trade, in, the, eighteenth, through, early, twentieth, centuries, sea, otter, populations, were, decimated, up, and, down, the, coast, from, alaska, to, baja, california, for, several, decades, before, their, rediscovery, it, was, presumed, that, sea, otters, were, completely, extinct, south, of, the, pacific, northwest, however, in, 1938, a, raft, of, about, fifty, individuals, was, discovered, under, a, bridge, by, the, bixby, river, between, santa, cruz, and, big, sur, california, this, discovery, was, soon, followed, by, the, taking, into, captivity, of, numerous, members, of, the, populations, in, order, to, begin, captive, breeding, for, population, restoration, however, with, a, population, size, of, fifty, and, the, low, genetic, diversity, amongst, the, population, post, fur, trade, but, pre, discovery, that, was, so, low, this, produced, an, evolutionary, bottleneck, an, evolutionary, bottleneck, is, a, phenomenon, that, occurs, when, population, size, is, greatly, diminished, from, prior, numbers, due, to, factors, like, overhunting, disease, or, environmental, changes, such, as, decreased, carrying, capacity, and, natural, disasters, this, in, turn, leads, to, low, genomic, diversity, within, the, population, which, can, have, adverse, effects, due, to, inbreeding, and, an, increase, in, genetic, drift, sea, otter, populations, decimated, in, the, eighteenth, through, early, twentieth, centuries, by, the, fur, trade, experienced, a, significant, population, bottleneck, in, genetic, diversity, following, their, divergence, from, their, most, common, ancestor, five, million, years, ago, sea, otters, have, developed, traits, dependent, on, polygenic, selection, or, the, evolution, of, numerous, traits, to, create, hallmark, features, like, thick, and, oily, fur, and, large, bones, compared, to, their, freshwater, sister, species, sea, otters, require, these, traits, to, survive, the, cold, waters, of, the, northern, pacific, ocean, in, which, they, spend, their, entire, lives, despite, occasionally, coming, out, of, the, water, as, pups, sea, otters, have, the, thickest, fur, of, any, animal, 1, 000, 000, hairs, per, square, inch, as, they, do, not, have, a, blubber, layer, while, their, oil, glands, help, matt, down, their, fur, and, keep, it, from, holding, air, thick, bones, also, prove, crucial, in, increasing, buoyancy, as, sea, otters, spend, long, hours, floating, atop, the, ocean, in, a, study, southern, and, northern, sea, otter, populations, were, compared, against, the, african, clawless, otter, and, it, was, determined, that, aquatic, traits, like, loss, of, smell, and, hair, thickness, independently, evolved, evidencing, a, complex, genome, of, polygenic, traits, resulting, in, complex, systems, this, study, was, only, able, to, take, place, after, sequencing, of, sea, otter, nuclear, genomes, and, through, phylogeny, to, find, a, close, ancestor, with, which, to, compare, genomes, previously, it, was, suspected, that, sea, otters, came, from, the, same, evolutionary, branch, as, earless, seals, such, as, harbor, and, monk, seals, sea, otters, have, experienced, numerous, population, bottlenecks, throughout, their, history, with, significant, numbers, being, wiped, out, 9, 000, 10, 000, generations, ago, and, 300, 700, generations, ago, long, before, the, fur, trade, these, previous, genetic, bottlenecks, are, responsible, for, already, low, genetic, diversity, amongst, species, members, making, the, secondary, bottleneck, caused, by, the, fur, trade, more, significant, these, primary, bottlenecks, were, most, likely, caused, by, disease, a, common, cause, for, genetic, bottlenecks, estimates, place, these, bottlenecks, at, leaving, around, ten, to, forty, animals, for, about, eight, to, forty, four, years, this, led, to, genetic, drift, as, the, populations, of, northern, and, southern, sea, otters, were, cut, off, from, one, another, by, thousands, of, miles, leading, to, significant, genomic, differences, however, the, modern, population, bottleneck, caused, by, the, fur, trade, of, the, eighteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, presents, the, most, significant, concern, to, scientists, and, conservationists, attempting, to, recover, population, numbers, and, genetic, diversity, each, bottleneck, has, lowered, genomic, diversity, and, thus, increased, the, chance, of, deleterious, genetic, drift, in, which, a, population, because, of, low, effective, and, census, size, is, driven, to, inbreed, which, increases, effective, size, through, increased, mutations, however, these, mutations, like, most, mutations, are, neutral, if, not, decreasing, the, population, s, fitness, thus, leading, to, complications, in, populations, this, phenomenon, is, studied, more, widely, in, cheetah, populations, where, due, to, overhunting, throughout, the, eighteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, the, size, of, the, population, was, greatly, diminished, leading, to, inbreeding, and, the, rise, of, deleterious, mutations, however, thanks, to, conservation, agencies, worldwide, the, cheetah, population, is, slowly, returning, along, with, its, genetic, diversity, thanks, to, purposeful, inbreeding, with, several, different, cheetah, populations, the, recent, population, constraints, put, on, the, sea, otter, have, led, to, low, genomic, diversity, among, species, members, with, much, evidence, of, inbreeding, this, inbreeding, has, led, to, the, mutation, of, deleterious, missense, mutations, which, may, make, fast, paced, population, growth, difficult, for, conservation, reasons, while, longer, term, recovery, goals, bolstering, genetic, diversity, by, inbreeding, are, costly, and, challenging, they, could, significantly, aid, in, avoiding, the, further, evolution, of, deleterious, variation, thus, aiding, sea, otter, population, stabilization, this, method, has, already, been, utilized, in, returning, cheetah, populations, to, higher, numbers, and, higher, genetic, diversity, and, captive, breeding, programs, through, organizations, such, as, the, monterey, bay, aquarium, and, the, marine, mammal, center, make, the, chances, of, getting, sea, otter, populations, back, up, to, pre, fur, trade, numbers, possible, the, population, of, sea, otters, in, california, has, risen, to, around, 3, 000, in, the, wild, while, this, figure, is, far, below, pre, fur, trade, numbers, it, represents, a, massive, improvement, in, the, conservation, of, the, species, and, a, massive, increase, in, genetic, diversity, on, the, other, hand, northern, sea, otters, have, reached, back, up, to, pre, fur, trade, population, numbers, with, populations, living, all, along, the, state, s, coast, from, ketchikan, in, the, south, to, attu, in, the, west, historical, populations, however, are, estimated, to, have, been, between, 150, 000, and, 300, 000, individuals, living, along, the, northern, pacific, rim, from, baja, california, to, hokkaido, island, in, japan, modern, conservation, techniques, have, included, breeding, northern, and, southern, populations, of, sea, otters, to, increase, genetic, diversity, and, prevent, both, inbreeding, and, genetic, drift, moreover, the, introduction, of, the, marine, mammal, protection, act, in, the, 1970s, made, their, hunting, highly, illegal, in, the, united, states
