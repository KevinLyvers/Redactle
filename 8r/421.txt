pieris, brassicae, the, large, white, also, called, cabbage, butterfly, cabbage, white, cabbage, moth, erroneously, or, in, india, the, large, cabbage, white, is, a, butterfly, in, the, family, pieridae, it, is, a, close, relative, of, the, small, white, pieris, rapae, the, large, white, is, common, throughout, europe, north, africa, and, asia, the, large, white, is, common, throughout, europe, north, africa, and, asia, to, the, himalayas, often, in, agricultural, areas, meadows, and, parkland, it, has, managed, to, establish, a, population, in, south, africa, and, in, 1995, it, was, predicted, to, spread, to, australia, and, new, zealand, the, large, white, is, a, strong, flier, and, the, british, population, has, been, reinforced, in, most, years, by, migrations, from, the, continent, scattered, reports, of, the, large, white, from, the, north, eastern, united, states, new, york, rhode, island, and, maine, over, the, past, century, are, of, a, dubious, nature, and, indicate, either, accidental, transport, or, intentional, release, such, introductions, threaten, to, establish, this, agricultural, pest, in, north, america, in, 2010, the, butterfly, was, found, in, nelson, new, zealand, where, it, is, known, as, the, great, white, butterfly, it, is, classed, as, an, unwanted, pest, due, to, the, potential, effect, on, crops, for, a, limited, period, in, october, 2013, the, department, of, conservation, offered, a, monetary, reward, for, the, capture, of, the, butterfly, after, two, weeks, the, public, had, captured, 134, butterflies, netting, 10, for, each, one, handed, in, as, a, result, of, this, and, other, containment, measures, such, as, over, 263, 000, searches, in, the, upper, south, island, and, the, release, of, predatory, wasps, the, large, white, was, officially, declared, to, be, eradicated, from, new, zealand, as, of, december, 2014, the, large, white, ova, are, pale, yellow, turning, darker, yellow, within, twenty, four, hours, of, being, oviposited, a, few, hours, prior, to, hatching, they, become, black, the, shell, more, transparent, and, the, larvae, visible, within, large, white, larvae, experience, four, moultings, and, five, instars, the, first, instar, follows, the, hatching, of, the, egg, into, large, white, larvae, the, larvae, are, light, yellow, with, distinctive, brown, heads, and, have, soft, bodies, the, larvae, appear, to, be, very, hairy, following, a, moulting, the, larvae, enter, the, second, instar, they, have, tubercles, covered, with, black, hair, in, the, third, instar, large, white, larvae, display, more, activity, this, instar, is, when, the, larvae, are, observed, to, eat, voraciously, and, cause, significant, amounts, of, damage, to, their, host, plant, at, this, point, they, are, observed, to, be, more, yellow, in, colour, studded, with, black, dots, following, the, third, instar, the, larvae, go, through, the, fourth, instar, with, similar, appearances, as, the, larvae, of, the, third, instar, but, with, more, aggrandized, size, and, feeding, behaviour, the, large, white, larvae, are, observed, to, be, cylindrical, robust, and, elongated, by, the, fifth, instar, yellow, in, colour, and, with, bright, colouration, on, their, abdomen, and, thorax, they, are, also, observed, to, have, a, grey, and, black, head, this, instar, requires, maximum, food, quality, and, quantity, in, order, to, aid, in, full, development, otherwise, the, larva, dies, before, becoming, an, adult, butterfly, for, both, males, and, females, the, wings, are, white, with, black, tips, on, the, forewings, the, female, also, has, two, black, spots, on, each, forewing, the, underside, of, each, wing, is, a, pale, greenish, and, serves, as, excellent, camouflage, when, at, rest, the, black, markings, are, generally, darker, in, the, summer, brood, the, large, white, butterfly, s, wingspan, reaches, 5, to, 6, 5, cm, on, average, the, upperside, of, the, male, is, creamy, white, the, forewing, is, irrorated, sprinkled, with, black, scales, at, the, base, and, along, the, costa, for, a, short, distance, the, apex, and, termen, above, vein, 2, are, more, or, less, broadly, black, with, the, inner, margin, of, the, black, area, containing, a, regular, even, curve, in, one, or, two, specimens, a, small, longitudinally, narrow, black, spot, was, found, in, interspace, 3, hindwing, uniform, irrorated, with, black, scales, at, base, a, large, black, subcostal, spot, before, the, apex, and, in, a, few, specimens, indications, of, black, scaling, on, the, termen, anteriorly, the, underside, of, the, forewing, is, white, slightly, irrorated, with, black, scales, at, the, base, of, cell, and, along, costa, the, apex, is, light, ochraceous, brown, with, a, large, black, spot, in, outer, half, of, interspace, 1, and, another, quadrate, black, spot, at, base, of, interspace, 3, the, hindwing, is, light, ochraceous, brown, closely, irrorated, with, minute, black, scales, the, subcostal, black, spot, before, the, apex, shows, through, from, the, upperside, the, antennae, are, black, and, white, at, apex, the, head, thorax, and, abdomen, are, black, with, some, white, hairs, where, underneath, is, whitish, the, upperside, of, the, female, is, similar, to, that, of, the, male, but, the, irroration, of, black, scales, at, the, bases, of, the, wings, is, more, extended, the, black, area, on, apex, and, termen, of, forewing, is, broader, its, inner, margin, less, evenly, curved, a, conspicuous, large, black, spot, also, exists, in, the, outer, half, of, interspace, 1, near, the, base, of, interspace, 3, on, the, hindwing, the, subcostal, black, spot, before, the, apex, is, much, larger, and, more, prominent, the, underside, is, similar, to, that, of, the, male, but, the, apex, of, the, forewing, and, the, whole, surface, of, the, hindwing, is, a, light, ochraceous, yellow, not, ochraceous, brown, the, black, discal, spots, on, forewing, are, much, larger, the, antennae, head, thorax, and, abdomen, of, the, females, are, the, same, as, for, the, male, the, large, white, butterfly, s, habitat, consists, of, large, open, spaces, as, well, as, farms, and, vegetable, gardens, because, of, the, availability, of, its, food, source, some, favoured, locations, include, walls, fences, tree, trunks, and, often, their, food, plant, they, primarily, hover, around, these, locations, which, should, contain, both, wild, and, cultivated, crucifer, as, well, as, oil, seed, rape, cabbages, and, brussels, sprouts, these, butterflies, can, be, polyandrous, but, it, is, not, the, predominant, mating, system, this, means, that, though, some, female, butterflies, can, have, more, than, one, mate, most, of, the, large, white, females, only, have, one, male, mate, at, a, time, through, a, monogamous, mating, system, two, generations, of, butterflies, are, produced, each, year, the, first, brood, consists, of, adults, with, a, spring, hatching, around, april, the, second, brood, is, made, up, of, adults, that, hatch, around, july, sometimes, a, third, brood, can, be, observed, farther, along, in, the, summer, if, the, weather, is, warm, enough, these, female, butterflies, oviposit, in, clusters, on, the, undersides, of, leaves, because, the, larvae, prefer, the, morphology, of, leaf, undersides, over, the, upper, surface, of, leaves, to, oviposit, the, female, butterflies, use, the, tip, of, the, abdomen, and, arrange, the, ova, in, specific, batches, the, pre, oviposition, period, which, lasts, three, to, eight, days, provides, ample, time, for, these, butterflies, to, mate, females, tend, to, use, their, forelegs, to, drum, on, the, surfaces, of, their, intended, leaves, as, a, test, of, the, plant, s, suitability, for, breeding, if, they, find, a, suitable, surface, female, large, whites, oviposit, two, to, three, days, following, copulation, they, oviposit, approximately, six, to, seven, times, in, eight, days, the, females, can, pair, up, to, mate, again, approximately, five, or, more, days, after, the, previous, mating, females, rely, on, visual, cues, such, as, the, colours, of, plants, to, decide, where, to, lay, their, eggs, they, favour, green, surfaces, in, particular, to, display, oviposition, behaviour, this, colour, preference, could, be, due, to, the, fact, that, the, large, white, s, food, source, also, acts, as, a, host, plant, for, oviposition, most, females, choose, nectar, plants, like, buddleia, or, thistles, which, are, green, and, ideal, plants, for, the, larvae, these, plants, used, as, oviposition, sites, typically, contain, mustard, oil, glucosides, whose, primary, function, is, to, help, the, larvae, survive, as, their, essential, food, source, for, instance, previous, studies, have, shown, that, the, large, white, larvae, do, not, survive, if, the, adult, butterflies, oviposit, on, a, different, host, plant, such, as, broad, bean, vicia, faba, because, this, bean, does, not, contain, the, proper, nutrients, to, aid, larval, development, the, large, white, eggs, hatch, approximately, one, week, after, being, laid, and, live, as, a, group, for, some, time, the, hatching, period, constitutes, around, two, to, seven, hours, upon, hatching, they, cause, a, lot, of, damage, to, the, host, plant, by, eating, away, at, and, destroying, the, host, plant, as, expected, during, the, colder, moments, of, the, day, they, may, appear, inactive, dormant, the, large, whites, are, found, throughout, most, of, eurasia, though, there, are, some, seasonal, fluctuations, present, due, to, migration, the, northern, populations, tend, to, be, augmented, during, the, summer, migration, season, from, butterflies, from, southern, areas, the, large, whites, fly, starting, early, spring, and, keep, migrating, until, seasons, shift, to, autumn, and, the, resultant, cold, weather, this, means, the, large, whites, typically, take, two, to, three, flights, per, butterfly, reproductive, season, large, white, butterfly, migration, patterns, are, typically, observed, only, when, there, is, a, disturbance, in, general, the, large, white, butterfly, s, migratory, patterns, are, atypical, normally, butterflies, fly, towards, the, poles, in, the, spring, and, towards, the, more, temperate, equator, during, the, fall, however, they, fly, in, random, directions, excluding, north, in, the, spring, and, there, is, little, return, migration, observed, however, it, has, been, hard, to, track, entire, migratory, paths, since, these, butterflies, can, migrate, more, than, 800, kilometres, thus, individual, butterflies, may, not, migrate, the, 800, kilometres, but, rather, that, other, butterflies, start, their, migrations, from, where, the, other, butterflies, ended, large, white, broods, in, the, north, have, not, been, seen, to, overwinter, nor, hibernate, over, the, winter, successfully, however, they, have, been, observed, to, hibernate, in, the, south, males, do, not, display, considerable, amounts, of, territorial, behaviour, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, could, be, a, reason, why, there, is, no, observed, significant, sexual, dimorphism, between, the, male, and, female, large, white, butterflies, large, white, butterflies, have, a, preference, for, what, types, of, food, plant, they, usually, eat, studies, have, shown, that, the, preference, for, certain, plants, is, reliant, upon, the, butterflies, previous, experiences, the, large, white, butterflies, then, are, shown, to, rely, on, the, species, of, food, plants, the, time, of, experience, and, the, choice, situation, thus, the, large, white, butterflies, learn, what, types, of, foods, they, prefer, rather, than, relying, on, their, sense, organs, or, physiological, changes, in, contrast, this, preference, for, adult, food, plant, differs, from, the, preference, of, female, large, whites, using, visual, cues, such, as, plant, colour, to, determine, the, best, host, plants, for, oviposition, plants, with, mustard, oil, glucosides, are, important, for, this, butterfly, because, it, dictates, their, eating, behaviours, and, resultant, survival, rates, as, specified, in, the, section, regarding, oviposition, this, is, so, beneficial, for, large, whites, because, their, large, consumption, of, plants, containing, mustard, oils, is, the, specific, reason, they, are, so, distasteful, to, predators, such, as, birds, thus, caterpillars, are, protected, from, attack, despite, them, being, brightly, coloured, in, fact, the, bright, colouration, is, to, signal, to, predators, that, they, taste, bad, however, there, is, more, benefit, to, this, species, use, of, mustard, oil, glucosides, in, addition, to, predator, protection, these, glucosides, belong, to, a, class, of, stimuli, that, produce, the, biting, responses, associated, with, eating, some, plants, contain, alkaloids, and, steroids, these, reduce, and, inhibit, the, butterflies, responsiveness, to, mustard, oil, glucosides, thus, this, utilization, of, mustard, oil, glucosides, dramatically, affects, the, behaviour, of, the, butterfly, and, the, resulting, food, selection, for, survival, the, food, source, of, the, larva, of, the, white, butterfly, are, cabbages, radishes, and, the, undersides, of, leaves, adults, feed, on, flower, nectar, large, white, butterflies, do, not, have, a, specific, group, of, predators, instead, they, are, preyed, upon, by, a, wide, range, of, animals, and, even, the, occasional, plant, this, butterfly, s, main, predators, include, birds, however, large, whites, can, also, be, preyed, upon, by, species, in, orders, such, as, hymenoptera, hemiptera, coleoptera, diptera, arachnid, some, species, of, mammals, one, of, reptiles, one, species, of, insectivorous, plant, and, species, in, amphibian, orders, as, well, as, other, miscellaneous, insect, species, the, butterflies, are, typically, preyed, upon, as, eggs, larvae, and, imagoes, large, white, butterflies, emit, an, unpleasant, smell, which, deters, predators, in, addition, large, whites, are, an, aposematic, species, meaning, that, they, display, warning, colours, which, benefits, the, large, whites, against, predation, this, aposematic, colouration, occurs, in, the, larval, pupal, and, imago, stages, where, toxic, mustard, oil, glycosides, from, food, plants, are, stored, in, the, individuals, bodies, aposematism, is, not, entirely, related, to, m, llerian, mimicry, however, large, white, larvae, often, benefit, from, multiple, other, aposematic, larvae, from, other, species, such, as, the, larvae, of, papilio, machaon, the, crops, most, susceptible, to, p, brassicae, damage, in, areas, in, europe, are, those, in, the, genus, brassica, cabbage, mustard, and, their, allies, particularly, brussels, sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kohlrabi, rape, swede, and, turnip, the, attacks, to, crops, are, rather, localized, and, can, lead, to, 100, crop, loss, in, a, certain, area, in, addition, because, of, its, strong, inclination, to, migrate, adults, may, infest, new, areas, that, were, previously, free, from, attack, because, many, of, the, host, plants, of, p, brassicae, are, sold, for, consumption, damage, by, these, butterflies, can, cause, a, great, reduction, of, crop, value, larvae, may, also, bore, into, the, vegetable, heads, of, cabbage, and, cauliflower, and, cause, damage, high, populations, of, these, larvae, may, also, skeletonise, their, host, plants, in, present, day, areas, such, as, great, britain, p, brassicae, are, now, less, threatening, as, pests, because, of, natural, and, chemical, control, reasons, however, it, is, still, considered, a, pest, in, other, european, countries, in, china, india, nepal, and, russia, in, fact, it, is, estimated, to, cause, over, 40, yield, loss, annually, on, different, crop, vegetables, in, india, and, turkey, subspecies, include, the, following
