in, politics, humanitarian, aid, and, the, social, sciences, hunger, is, defined, as, a, condition, in, which, a, person, does, not, have, the, physical, or, financial, capability, to, eat, sufficient, food, to, meet, basic, nutritional, needs, for, a, sustained, period, in, the, field, of, hunger, relief, the, term, hunger, is, used, in, a, sense, that, goes, beyond, the, common, desire, for, food, that, all, humans, experience, also, known, as, an, appetite, the, most, extreme, form, of, hunger, when, malnutrition, is, widespread, and, when, people, have, started, dying, of, starvation, through, lack, of, access, to, sufficient, nutritious, food, leads, to, a, declaration, of, famine, throughout, history, portions, of, the, world, s, population, have, often, suffered, sustained, periods, of, hunger, in, many, cases, hunger, resulted, from, food, supply, disruptions, caused, by, war, plagues, or, adverse, weather, in, the, decades, following, world, war, ii, technological, progress, and, enhanced, political, cooperation, suggested, it, might, be, possible, to, substantially, reduce, the, number, of, people, suffering, from, hunger, while, progress, was, uneven, by, 2015, the, threat, of, extreme, hunger, had, receded, for, a, large, portion, of, the, world, s, population, according, to, the, fao, s, 2023, the, state, of, food, security, and, nutrition, in, the, world, report, this, positive, trend, had, reversed, from, about, 2017, when, a, gradual, rise, in, number, of, people, suffering, from, chronic, hunger, became, discernible, in, 2020, and, 2021, due, to, the, covid, 19, pandemic, there, was, an, increase, in, the, number, of, people, suffering, from, undernourishment, a, recovery, occurred, in, 2022, along, with, the, economic, rebound, though, the, impact, on, global, food, markets, caused, by, the, invasion, of, ukraine, meant, the, reduction, in, world, hunger, was, limited, while, most, of, the, world, s, people, continue, to, live, in, asia, much, of, the, increase, in, hunger, since, 2017, occurred, in, africa, and, south, america, the, fao, s, 2017, report, discussed, three, principal, reasons, for, the, recent, increase, in, hunger, climate, conflict, and, economic, slowdowns, the, 2018, edition, focused, on, extreme, weather, as, a, primary, driver, of, the, increase, in, hunger, finding, rising, rates, to, be, especially, severe, in, countries, where, agricultural, systems, were, most, sensitive, to, extreme, weather, variations, the, 2019, sofi, report, found, a, strong, correlation, between, increases, in, hunger, and, countries, that, had, suffered, an, economic, slowdown, the, 2020, edition, instead, looked, at, the, prospects, of, achieving, the, hunger, related, sustainable, development, goal, sdg, it, warned, that, if, nothing, was, done, to, counter, the, adverse, trends, of, the, past, six, years, the, number, of, people, suffering, from, chronic, hunger, could, rise, by, over, 150, million, by, 2030, the, 2023, report, reported, a, sharp, jump, in, hunger, caused, by, the, covid, 19, pandemic, which, leveled, off, in, 2022, many, thousands, of, organizations, are, engaged, in, the, field, of, hunger, relief, operating, at, local, national, regional, or, international, levels, some, of, these, organizations, are, dedicated, to, hunger, relief, while, others, may, work, in, several, different, fields, the, organizations, range, from, multilateral, institutions, to, national, governments, to, small, local, initiatives, such, as, independent, soup, kitchens, many, participate, in, umbrella, networks, that, connect, thousands, of, different, hunger, relief, organizations, at, the, global, level, much, of, the, world, s, hunger, relief, efforts, are, coordinated, by, the, un, and, geared, towards, achieving, sdg, 2, of, zero, hunger, by, 2030, there, is, one, globally, recognized, approach, for, defining, and, measuring, hunger, generally, used, by, those, studying, or, working, to, relieve, hunger, as, a, social, problem, this, is, the, united, nation, s, fao, measurement, which, is, typically, referred, to, as, chronic, undernourishment, or, in, older, publications, as, food, deprivation, chronic, hunger, or, just, plain, hunger, for, the, fao, not, all, of, the, organizations, in, the, hunger, relief, field, use, the, fao, definition, of, hunger, some, use, a, broader, definition, that, overlaps, more, fully, with, malnutrition, the, alternative, definitions, do, however, tend, to, go, beyond, the, commonly, understood, meaning, of, hunger, as, a, painful, or, uncomfortable, motivational, condition, the, desire, for, food, is, something, that, all, humans, frequently, experience, even, the, most, affluent, and, is, not, in, itself, a, social, problem, very, low, food, supply, can, be, described, as, food, insecure, with, hunger, a, change, in, description, was, made, in, 2006, at, the, recommendation, of, the, committee, on, national, statistics, national, research, council, 2006, in, order, to, distinguish, the, physiological, state, of, hunger, from, indicators, of, food, availability, food, insecure, is, when, food, intake, of, one, or, more, household, members, was, reduced, and, their, eating, patterns, were, disrupted, at, times, during, the, year, because, the, household, lacked, money, and, other, resources, for, food, food, security, statistics, is, measured, by, using, survey, data, based, on, household, responses, to, items, about, whether, the, household, was, able, to, obtain, enough, food, to, meet, their, needs, the, united, nations, publishes, an, annual, report, on, the, state, of, food, security, and, nutrition, across, the, world, led, by, the, fao, the, report, was, joint, authored, by, four, other, un, agencies, the, wfp, ifad, who, and, unicef, the, theme, of, the, 2024, report, is, on, how, efforts, to, meet, sdg, 2, 1, 2, 2, can, be, financed, the, fao, s, yearly, report, provides, a, statistical, overview, on, the, prevalence, of, hunger, around, the, world, and, is, widely, considered, the, main, global, reference, for, tracking, hunger, no, simple, set, of, statistics, can, ever, fully, capture, the, multi, dimensional, nature, of, hunger, however, reasons, include, that, the, fao, s, key, metric, for, hunger, undernourishment, is, defined, solely, in, terms, of, dietary, energy, availability, disregarding, micro, nutrients, such, as, vitamins, or, minerals, second, the, fao, uses, the, energy, requirements, for, minimum, activity, levels, as, a, benchmark, many, people, would, not, count, as, hungry, by, the, fao, s, measure, yet, still, be, eating, too, little, to, undertake, hard, manual, labour, which, might, be, the, only, sort, of, work, available, to, them, thirdly, the, fao, statistics, do, not, always, reflect, short, term, undernourishment, an, alternative, measure, of, hunger, across, the, world, is, the, global, hunger, index, ghi, unlike, the, fao, s, measure, the, ghi, defines, hunger, in, a, way, that, goes, beyond, raw, calorie, intake, to, include, for, example, ingestion, of, micronutrients, gdi, is, a, multidimensional, statistical, tool, used, to, describe, the, state, of, countries, hunger, situation, the, ghi, measures, progress, and, failures, in, the, global, fight, against, hunger, the, ghi, is, updated, once, a, year, the, data, from, the, 2015, report, showed, that, hunger, levels, have, dropped, 27, since, 2000, fifty, two, countries, remained, at, serious, or, alarming, levels, the, 2019, ghi, report, expresses, concern, about, the, increase, in, hunger, since, 2015, in, addition, to, the, latest, statistics, on, hunger, and, food, security, the, ghi, also, features, different, special, topics, each, year, the, 2019, report, includes, an, essay, on, hunger, and, climate, change, with, evidence, suggesting, that, areas, most, vulnerable, to, climate, change, have, suffered, much, of, the, recent, increases, in, hunger, throughout, history, the, need, to, aid, those, suffering, from, hunger, has, been, commonly, though, not, universally, recognized, the, philosopher, simone, weil, wrote, that, feeding, the, hungry, when, you, have, resources, to, do, so, is, the, most, obvious, of, all, human, obligations, she, says, that, as, far, back, as, ancient, egypt, many, believed, that, people, had, to, show, they, had, helped, the, hungry, in, order, to, justify, themselves, in, the, afterlife, weil, writes, that, social, progress, is, commonly, held, to, be, first, of, all, a, transition, to, a, state, of, human, society, in, which, people, will, not, suffer, from, hunger, social, historian, karl, polanyi, wrote, that, before, markets, became, the, world, s, dominant, form, of, economic, organization, in, the, 19th, century, most, human, societies, would, either, starve, all, together, or, not, at, all, because, communities, would, invariably, share, their, food, while, some, of, the, principles, for, avoiding, famines, had, been, laid, out, in, the, first, book, of, the, bible, they, were, not, always, understood, historical, hunger, relief, efforts, were, often, largely, left, to, religious, organizations, and, individual, kindness, even, up, to, early, modern, times, political, leaders, often, reacted, to, famine, with, bewilderment, and, confusion, from, the, first, age, of, globalization, which, began, in, the, 19th, century, it, became, more, common, for, the, elite, to, consider, problems, like, hunger, in, global, terms, however, as, early, globalization, largely, coincided, with, the, high, peak, of, influence, for, classical, liberalism, there, was, relatively, little, call, for, politicians, to, address, world, hunger, in, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, century, the, view, that, politicians, ought, not, to, intervene, against, hunger, was, increasingly, challenged, by, campaigning, journalists, there, were, also, more, frequent, calls, for, large, scale, intervention, against, world, hunger, from, academics, and, politicians, such, as, u, s, president, woodrow, wilson, funded, both, by, the, government, and, private, donations, the, u, s, was, able, to, dispatch, millions, of, tons, of, food, aid, to, european, countries, during, and, in, the, years, immediately, after, wwi, organized, by, agencies, such, as, the, american, relief, administration, hunger, as, an, academic, and, social, topic, came, to, further, prominence, in, the, u, s, thanks, to, mass, media, coverage, of, the, issue, as, a, domestic, problem, during, the, great, depression, while, there, had, been, increasing, attention, to, hunger, relief, from, the, late, 19th, century, dr, david, grigg, has, summarised, that, prior, to, the, end, of, world, war, ii, world, hunger, still, received, relatively, little, academic, or, political, attention, whereas, after, 1945, there, was, an, explosion, of, interest, in, the, topic, after, world, war, ii, a, new, international, politico, economic, order, came, into, being, which, was, later, described, as, embedded, liberalism, for, at, least, the, first, decade, after, the, war, the, united, states, then, by, far, the, period, s, most, dominant, national, actor, was, strongly, supportive, of, efforts, to, tackle, world, hunger, and, to, promote, international, development, it, heavily, funded, the, united, nation, s, development, programmes, and, later, the, efforts, of, other, multilateral, organizations, like, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, and, the, world, bank, wb, the, newly, established, united, nations, became, a, leading, player, in, co, ordinating, the, global, fight, against, hunger, the, un, has, three, agencies, that, work, to, promote, food, security, and, agricultural, development, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, the, world, food, programme, wfp, and, the, international, fund, for, agricultural, development, ifad, fao, is, the, world, s, agricultural, knowledge, agency, providing, policy, and, technical, assistance, to, developing, countries, to, promote, food, security, nutrition, and, sustainable, agricultural, production, particularly, in, rural, areas, wfp, s, key, mission, is, to, deliver, food, into, the, hands, of, the, hungry, poor, the, agency, steps, in, during, emergencies, and, uses, food, to, aid, recovery, after, emergencies, its, longer, term, approaches, to, hunger, helps, the, transition, from, recovery, to, development, ifad, with, its, knowledge, of, rural, poverty, and, exclusive, focus, on, poor, rural, people, designs, and, implements, programmes, to, help, those, people, access, the, assets, services, and, opportunities, they, need, to, overcome, poverty, following, successful, post, wwii, reconstruction, of, germany, and, japan, the, imf, and, wb, began, to, turn, their, attention, to, the, developing, world, a, great, many, civil, society, actors, were, also, active, in, trying, to, combat, hunger, especially, after, the, late, 1970s, when, global, media, began, to, bring, the, plight, of, starving, people, in, places, like, ethiopia, to, wider, attention, most, significant, of, all, especially, in, the, late, 1960s, and, 70s, the, green, revolution, helped, improved, agricultural, technology, propagate, throughout, the, world, the, united, states, began, to, change, its, approach, to, the, problem, of, world, hunger, from, about, the, mid, 1950s, influential, members, of, the, administration, became, less, enthusiastic, about, methods, they, saw, as, promoting, an, over, reliance, on, the, state, as, they, feared, that, might, assist, the, spread, of, communism, by, the, 1980s, the, previous, consensus, in, favour, of, moderate, government, intervention, had, been, displaced, across, the, western, world, the, imf, and, world, bank, in, particular, began, to, promote, market, based, solutions, in, cases, where, countries, became, dependent, on, the, imf, they, sometimes, forced, national, governments, to, prioritize, debt, repayments, and, sharply, cut, public, services, this, sometimes, had, a, negative, effect, on, efforts, to, combat, hunger, organizations, such, as, food, first, raised, the, issue, of, food, sovereignty, and, claimed, that, every, country, on, earth, with, the, possible, minor, exceptions, of, some, city, states, has, sufficient, agricultural, capacity, to, feed, its, own, people, but, that, the, free, trade, economic, order, which, from, the, late, 1970s, to, about, 2008, had, been, associated, with, such, institutions, as, the, imf, and, world, bank, had, prevented, this, from, happening, the, world, bank, itself, claimed, it, was, part, of, the, solution, to, hunger, asserting, that, the, best, way, for, countries, to, break, the, cycle, of, poverty, and, hunger, was, to, build, export, led, economies, that, provide, the, financial, means, to, buy, foodstuffs, on, the, world, market, however, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, world, bank, and, imf, became, less, dogmatic, about, promoting, free, market, reforms, they, increasingly, returned, to, the, view, that, government, intervention, does, have, a, role, to, play, and, that, it, can, be, advisable, for, governments, to, support, food, security, with, policies, favourable, to, domestic, agriculture, even, for, countries, that, do, not, have, a, comparative, advantage, in, that, area, as, of, 2012, the, world, bank, remains, active, in, helping, governments, to, intervene, against, hunger, until, at, least, the, 1980s, and, to, an, extent, the, 1990s, the, dominant, academic, view, concerning, world, hunger, was, that, it, was, a, problem, of, demand, exceeding, supply, proposed, solutions, often, focused, on, boosting, food, production, and, sometimes, on, birth, control, there, were, exceptions, to, this, even, as, early, as, the, 1940s, lord, boyd, orr, the, first, head, of, the, un, s, fao, had, perceived, hunger, as, largely, a, problem, of, distribution, and, drew, up, comprehensive, plans, to, correct, this, few, agreed, with, him, at, the, time, however, and, he, resigned, after, failing, to, secure, support, for, his, plans, from, the, us, and, great, britain, in, 1998, amartya, sen, won, a, nobel, prize, in, part, for, demonstrating, that, hunger, in, modern, times, is, not, typically, the, product, of, a, lack, of, food, rather, hunger, usually, arises, from, food, distribution, problems, or, from, governmental, policies, in, the, developed, and, developing, world, it, has, since, been, broadly, accepted, that, world, hunger, results, from, issues, with, the, distribution, as, well, as, the, production, of, food, sen, s, 1981, essay, poverty, and, famines, an, essay, on, entitlement, and, deprivation, played, a, prominent, part, in, forging, the, new, consensus, in, 2007, and, 2008, rapidly, increasing, food, prices, caused, a, global, food, crisis, food, riots, erupted, in, several, dozen, countries, in, at, least, two, cases, haiti, and, madagascar, this, led, to, the, toppling, of, governments, a, second, global, food, crisis, unfolded, due, to, the, spike, in, food, prices, of, late, 2010, and, early, 2011, fewer, food, riots, occurred, due, in, part, to, greater, availability, of, food, stock, piles, for, relief, however, several, analysts, argue, the, food, crisis, was, one, of, the, causes, of, the, arab, spring, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, attention, paid, to, the, problem, of, hunger, by, the, leaders, of, advanced, nations, such, as, those, that, form, the, g8, had, somewhat, subsided, prior, to, 2009, large, scale, efforts, to, fight, hunger, were, mainly, undertaken, by, governments, of, the, worst, affected, countries, by, civil, society, actors, and, by, multilateral, and, regional, organizations, in, 2009, pope, benedict, published, his, third, encyclical, caritas, in, veritate, which, emphasised, the, importance, of, fighting, against, hunger, the, encyclical, was, intentionally, published, immediately, before, the, july, 2009, g8, summit, to, maximise, its, influence, on, that, event, at, the, summit, which, took, place, at, l, aquila, in, central, italy, the, l, aquila, food, security, initiative, was, launched, with, a, total, of, us, 22, billion, committed, to, combat, hunger, food, prices, fell, sharply, in, 2009, and, early, 2010, though, analysts, credit, this, much, more, to, farmers, increasing, production, in, response, to, the, 2008, spike, in, prices, than, to, the, fruits, of, enhanced, government, action, however, since, the, 2009, g8, summit, the, fight, against, hunger, became, a, high, profile, issue, among, the, leaders, of, the, worlds, major, nations, and, was, a, prominent, part, of, the, agenda, for, the, 2012, g, 20, summit, in, april, 2012, the, food, assistance, convention, was, signed, the, world, s, first, legally, binding, international, agreement, on, food, aid, the, may, 2012, copenhagen, consensus, recommended, that, efforts, to, combat, hunger, and, malnutrition, should, be, the, first, priority, for, politicians, and, private, sector, philanthropists, looking, to, maximize, the, effectiveness, of, aid, spending, they, put, this, ahead, of, other, priorities, like, the, fight, against, malaria, and, aids, also, in, may, 2012, u, s, president, barack, obama, launched, a, new, alliance, for, food, security, and, nutrition, a, broad, partnership, between, private, sector, governmental, and, civil, society, actors, that, aimed, to, achieve, sustained, and, inclusive, agricultural, growth, and, raise, 50, million, people, out, of, poverty, over, the, next, 10, years, the, uk, s, prime, minister, david, cameron, held, a, hunger, summit, on, 12, august, the, last, day, of, the, 2012, summer, olympics, the, fight, against, hunger, has, also, been, joined, by, an, increased, number, of, regular, people, while, folk, throughout, the, world, had, long, contributed, to, efforts, to, alleviate, hunger, in, the, developing, world, there, has, recently, been, a, rapid, increase, in, the, numbers, involved, in, tackling, domestic, hunger, even, within, the, economically, advanced, nations, of, the, global, north, this, had, happened, much, earlier, in, north, america, than, it, did, in, europe, in, the, us, the, reagan, administration, scaled, back, welfare, the, early, 1980s, leading, to, a, vast, increase, of, charity, sector, efforts, to, help, americans, unable, to, buy, enough, to, eat, according, to, a, 1992, survey, of, 1000, randomly, selected, us, voters, 77, of, americans, had, contributed, to, efforts, to, feed, the, hungry, either, by, volunteering, for, various, hunger, relief, agencies, such, as, food, banks, and, soup, kitchens, or, by, donating, cash, or, food, europe, with, its, more, generous, welfare, systems, had, little, awareness, of, domestic, hunger, until, the, food, price, inflation, that, began, in, late, 2006, and, especially, as, austerity, imposed, welfare, cuts, began, to, take, effect, in, 2010, various, surveys, reported, that, upwards, of, 10, of, europe, s, population, had, begun, to, suffer, from, food, insecurity, especially, since, 2011, there, has, been, a, substantial, increase, in, grass, roots, efforts, to, help, the, hungry, by, means, of, food, banks, both, in, the, uk, and, in, continental, europe, by, july, 2012, the, 2012, us, drought, had, already, caused, a, rapid, increase, in, the, price, of, grain, and, soy, with, a, knock, on, effect, on, the, price, of, meat, as, well, as, affecting, hungry, people, in, the, us, this, caused, prices, to, rise, on, the, global, markets, the, us, is, the, world, s, biggest, exporter, of, food, this, led, to, much, talk, of, a, possible, third, 21st, century, global, food, crisis, the, financial, times, reported, that, the, brics, may, not, be, as, badly, affected, as, they, were, in, the, earlier, crises, of, 2008, and, 2011, however, smaller, developing, countries, that, must, import, a, substantial, portion, of, their, food, could, be, hard, hit, the, un, and, g20, has, begun, contingency, planning, so, as, to, be, ready, to, intervene, if, a, third, global, crisis, breaks, out, by, august, 2013, however, concerns, had, been, allayed, with, above, average, grain, harvests, expected, from, major, exporters, including, japan, brazil, ukraine, and, the, us, 2014, also, saw, a, good, worldwide, harvest, leading, to, speculation, that, grain, prices, could, soon, begin, to, fall, in, an, april, 2013, summit, held, in, dublin, concerning, hunger, nutrition, climate, justice, and, the, post, 2015, mdg, framework, for, global, justice, ireland, s, president, higgins, said, that, only, 10, of, deaths, from, hunger, are, due, to, armed, conflict, and, natural, disasters, with, ongoing, hunger, being, both, the, greatest, ethical, failure, of, the, current, global, system, and, the, greatest, ethical, challenge, facing, the, global, community, 4, 15, billion, of, new, commitments, were, made, to, tackle, hunger, at, a, june, 2013, hunger, summit, held, in, london, hosted, by, the, governments, of, britain, and, brazil, together, with, the, children, s, investment, fund, foundation, despite, the, hardship, caused, by, the, 2007, 2009, financial, crisis, and, global, increases, in, food, prices, that, occurred, around, the, same, time, the, un, s, global, statistics, show, it, was, followed, by, close, to, year, on, year, reductions, in, the, numbers, suffering, from, hunger, around, the, world, by, 2019, however, evidence, had, mounted, that, this, progress, seemed, to, have, gone, into, reverse, over, the, last, four, years, the, numbers, suffering, from, hunger, had, risen, both, in, absolute, terms, and, very, slightly, even, as, a, percentage, of, the, world, s, population, in, 2019, fao, its, annual, edition, of, the, state, of, food, and, agriculture, which, asserted, that, food, loss, and, waste, has, potential, effects, on, food, security, and, nutrition, through, changes, in, the, four, dimensions, of, food, security, food, availability, access, utilization, and, stability, however, the, links, between, food, loss, and, waste, reduction, and, food, security, are, complex, and, positive, outcomes, are, not, always, certain, reaching, acceptable, levels, of, food, security, and, nutrition, inevitably, implies, certain, levels, of, food, loss, and, waste, maintaining, buffers, to, ensure, food, stability, requires, a, certain, amount, of, food, to, be, lost, or, wasted, at, the, same, time, ensuring, food, safety, involves, discarding, unsafe, food, which, then, is, counted, as, lost, or, wasted, while, higher, quality, diets, tend, to, include, more, highly, perishable, foods, how, the, impacts, on, the, different, dimensions, of, food, security, play, out, and, affect, the, food, security, of, different, population, groups, depends, on, where, in, the, food, supply, chain, the, reduction, in, losses, or, waste, takes, place, as, well, as, on, where, nutritionally, vulnerable, and, food, insecure, people, are, located, geographically, in, april, and, may, 2020, concerns, were, expressed, that, the, covid, 19, pandemic, could, result, in, a, doubling, in, global, hunger, unless, world, leaders, acted, to, prevent, this, agencies, such, as, the, wfp, warned, that, this, could, include, the, number, of, people, facing, acute, hunger, rising, from, 135, million, to, about, 265, million, by, the, end, of, 2020, indications, of, extreme, hunger, were, seen, in, various, cities, such, as, fatal, stampedes, when, word, spread, that, emergency, food, aid, was, being, handed, out, letters, calling, for, co, ordinated, action, to, offset, the, effects, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, were, written, to, the, g20, and, g7, by, various, actors, including, ngos, un, staff, corporations, academics, and, former, national, leaders, the, fao, found, that, 122, million, more, people, experienced, hunger, in, 2022, compared, to, 2019, following, the, 2022, invasion, of, ukraine, concerns, have, been, raised, over, hunger, resulting, from, rising, food, prices, this, is, forecast, to, risk, civil, unrest, even, in, many, middle, income, countries, where, government, capability, to, protect, their, populations, was, largely, exhausted, by, the, covid, pandemic, and, has, not, yet, recovered, many, thousands, of, hunger, relief, organisations, exist, across, the, world, some, but, not, all, are, entirely, dedicated, to, fighting, hunger, they, range, from, independent, soup, kitchens, that, serve, only, one, locality, to, global, organisations, organisations, working, at, the, global, and, regional, level, will, often, focus, much, of, their, efforts, on, helping, hungry, communities, to, better, feed, themselves, for, example, by, sharing, agricultural, technology, with, some, exceptions, organisations, that, work, just, on, the, local, level, tend, to, focus, more, on, providing, food, directly, to, hungry, people, many, of, the, entities, are, connected, by, a, web, of, national, regional, and, global, alliances, that, help, them, share, resources, knowledge, and, coordinate, efforts, the, united, nations, is, central, to, global, efforts, to, relieve, hunger, most, especially, through, the, fao, and, also, via, other, agencies, such, as, wfp, ifad, who, and, unicef, after, the, millennium, development, goals, expired, in, 2015, the, sustainable, development, goals, sdgs, became, key, objectives, to, shape, the, world, s, response, to, development, challenges, such, as, hunger, in, particular, goal, 2, zero, hunger, sets, globally, agreed, targets, to, end, hunger, achieve, food, security, and, improved, nutrition, and, promote, sustainable, agriculture, aside, from, the, un, agencies, themselves, hundreds, of, other, actors, address, the, problem, of, hunger, on, the, global, level, often, involving, participation, in, large, umbrella, organisations, these, include, national, governments, religious, groups, international, charities, and, in, some, cases, international, corporations, though, except, perhaps, in, the, cases, of, dedicated, charities, the, priority, these, organisations, assign, to, hunger, relief, may, vary, from, year, to, year, in, many, cases, the, organisations, partner, with, the, un, agencies, though, often, they, pursue, independent, goals, for, example, as, consensus, began, to, form, for, the, sdg, zero, hunger, goal, to, aim, to, end, hunger, by, 2030, a, number, of, organizations, formed, initiatives, with, the, more, ambitious, target, to, achieve, this, outcome, early, by, 2025, the, objective, of, sdg, 2, is, to, end, hunger, achieve, food, security, and, improved, nutrition, and, promote, sustainable, agriculture, by, 2030, sdg2, recognizes, that, dealing, with, hunger, is, not, only, based, on, increasing, food, production, but, also, on, proper, markets, access, to, land, and, technology, and, increased, and, efficient, incomes, for, farmers, a, report, by, the, international, food, policy, research, institute, ifpri, of, 2013, argued, that, the, emphasis, of, the, sdgs, should, be, on, eliminating, hunger, and, under, nutrition, rather, than, on, poverty, and, that, attempts, should, be, made, to, do, so, by, 2025, rather, than, 2030, the, argument, is, based, on, an, analysis, of, experiences, in, russia, china, vietnam, brazil, and, thailand, and, the, fact, that, people, suffering, from, severe, hunger, face, extra, impediments, to, improving, their, lives, whether, it, be, by, education, or, work, three, pathways, to, achieve, this, were, identified, 1, agriculture, led, 2, social, protection, and, nutrition, intervention, led, or, 3, a, combination, of, both, of, these, approaches, much, of, the, world, s, regional, alliances, are, located, in, africa, for, example, the, alliance, for, food, sovereignty, in, africa, or, the, alliance, for, a, green, revolution, in, africa, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, of, the, un, has, created, a, partnership, that, will, act, through, the, african, union, s, caadp, framework, aiming, to, end, hunger, in, africa, by, 2025, it, includes, different, interventions, including, support, for, improved, food, production, a, strengthening, of, social, protection, and, integration, of, the, right, to, food, into, national, legislation, examples, of, hunger, relief, organisations, that, operate, on, the, national, level, include, the, trussell, trust, in, the, united, kingdom, the, nalabothu, foundation, in, india, and, feeding, america, in, the, united, states, a, food, bank, or, foodbank, is, a, non, profit, charitable, organization, that, aids, in, the, distribution, of, food, to, those, who, have, difficulty, purchasing, enough, to, avoid, hunger, food, banks, tend, to, run, on, different, operating, models, depending, on, where, they, are, located, in, the, u, s, australia, and, to, some, extent, in, canada, foodbanks, tend, to, perform, a, warehouse, type, function, storing, and, delivering, food, to, front, line, food, orgs, but, not, giving, it, directly, to, hungry, peoples, themselves, in, much, of, europe, and, elsewhere, food, banks, operate, on, the, front, line, model, where, they, hand, out, parcels, of, uncooked, food, direct, to, the, hungry, typically, giving, them, enough, for, several, meals, which, they, can, eat, in, their, homes, in, the, u, s, and, australia, establishments, that, hand, out, uncooked, food, to, individual, people, are, instead, called, food, pantries, food, shelves, or, food, closets, in, less, developed, countries, there, are, charity, run, food, banks, that, operate, on, a, semi, commercial, system, that, differs, from, both, the, more, common, warehouse, and, frontline, models, in, some, rural, ldcs, such, as, malawi, food, is, often, relatively, cheap, and, plentiful, for, the, first, few, months, after, the, harvest, but, then, becomes, more, and, more, expensive, food, banks, in, those, areas, can, buy, large, amounts, of, food, shortly, after, the, harvest, and, then, as, food, prices, start, to, rise, they, sell, it, back, to, local, people, throughout, the, year, at, well, below, market, prices, such, food, banks, will, sometimes, also, act, as, centers, to, provide, small, holders, and, subsistence, farmers, with, various, forms, of, support, a, soup, kitchen, meal, center, or, food, kitchen, is, a, place, where, food, is, offered, to, the, hungry, for, free, or, at, a, below, market, price, frequently, located, in, lower, income, neighborhoods, they, are, often, staffed, by, volunteer, organizations, such, as, church, or, community, groups, soup, kitchens, sometimes, obtain, food, from, a, food, bank, for, free, or, at, a, low, price, because, they, are, considered, a, charity, which, makes, it, easier, for, them, to, feed, the, many, people, who, require, their, services, local, establishments, calling, themselves, food, banks, or, soup, kitchens, are, often, run, either, by, christian, churches, or, less, frequently, by, secular, civil, society, groups, other, religions, carry, out, similar, hunger, relief, efforts, though, sometimes, with, slightly, different, methods, for, example, in, the, sikh, tradition, of, langar, food, is, served, to, the, hungry, direct, from, sikh, temples, there, are, exceptions, to, this, for, example, in, the, uk, sikhs, run, some, of, the, food, banks, as, well, as, giving, out, food, direct, from, their, gurdwaras, world, bank, studies, consistently, find, that, about, 60, of, those, who, are, hungry, are, female, globally, women, typically, face, greater, economic, barriers, compared, to, men, and, have, access, to, fewer, resources, creating, greater, obstacles, to, food, security, in, both, developing, and, advanced, countries, parents, sometimes, go, without, food, so, they, can, feed, their, children, women, however, seem, more, likely, to, make, this, sacrifice, than, men, older, sources, sometimes, claim, this, phenomenon, is, unique, to, developing, countries, due, to, greater, sexual, inequality, more, recent, findings, suggested, that, mothers, often, miss, meals, in, advanced, economies, too, for, example, a, 2012, study, undertaken, by, netmums, in, the, uk, found, that, one, in, five, mothers, sometimes, misses, out, on, food, to, save, their, children, from, hunger, one, partner, households, are, especially, vulnerable, to, food, insecurity, and, highlight, a, gender, disparity, in, food, security, in, the, u, s, households, with, children, raised, by, single, mothers, are, more, likely, to, be, food, insecure, compared, to, households, with, single, fathers, differences, in, time, allocation, between, paid, work, and, unpaid, work, may, also, be, an, explanation, for, increased, food, disparity, in, women, lead, households, as, women, tend, to, dedicate, more, time, to, unpaid, work, comparatively, in, several, periods, and, regions, gender, has, also, been, an, important, factor, determining, whether, or, not, victims, of, hunger, would, make, suitable, examples, for, generating, enthusiasm, for, hunger, relief, efforts, james, vernon, in, his, hunger, a, modern, history, wrote, that, in, britain, before, the, twentieth, century, it, was, generally, only, women, and, children, suffering, from, hunger, who, could, arouse, compassion, men, who, failed, to, provide, for, themselves, and, their, families, were, often, regarded, with, contempt, this, changed, after, world, war, i, where, thousands, of, men, who, had, proved, their, manliness, in, combat, found, themselves, unable, to, secure, employment, similarly, female, gender, could, be, advantageous, for, those, wishing, to, advocate, for, hunger, relief, with, vernon, writing, that, being, a, woman, helped, emily, hobhouse, draw, the, plight, of, hungry, people, to, wider, attention, during, the, second, boer, war, the, elderly, have, an, increased, risk, of, going, hungry, as, well, as, increased, negative, effects, of, hunger, in, the, us, the, number, of, seniors, experiencing, hunger, rose, 88, between, 2001, and, 2011, this, age, group, suffers, the, most, from, chronic, conditions, including, heart, disease, diabetes, and, respiratory, diseases, eighty, percent, of, this, group, has, a, minimum, of, one, chronic, condition, and, almost, 70, have, two, or, more, these, illnesses, are, exacerbated, and, are, more, likely, to, develop, under, the, addition, of, hunger, a, report, from, 2017, shows, that, seniors, facing, this, issue, are, 60, more, likely, to, experience, depression, than, seniors, who, are, not, hungry, and, 40, are, more, likely, to, develop, congestive, heart, failure, the, added, stress, of, inconsistent, and, inadequate, feedings, make, these, conditions, much, more, dangerous, fixed, incomes, often, limit, the, elderly, s, ability, to, freely, purchase, food, necessities, medical, costs, and, housing, may, take, priority, over, quality, foods, limited, mobility, makes, it, difficult, for, these, individuals, to, physically, leave, their, homes, especially, in, areas, lacking, public, transportation, or, transportation, catering, to, a, disabled, body, the, covid, 19, pandemic, made, things, more, difficult, older, people, statistically, suffer, worse, outcomes, and, so, could, be, reluctant, to, venture, out, for, food, the, supplemental, nutrition, assistance, program, snap, provides, aid, to, low, income, seniors, in, relation, to, food, security, this, is, an, opportunity, for, seniors, who, receive, benefits, to, allocate, money, in, their, budgets, for, other, needs, such, as, medical, or, housing, bills, however, participation, is, extremely, low, fewer, than, half, of, eligible, seniors, are, enrolled, and, receive, benefits, 3, out, of, five, seniors, are, qualified,
