plant, hormones, or, phytohormones, are, signal, molecules, produced, within, plants, that, occur, in, extremely, low, concentrations, plant, hormones, control, all, aspects, of, plant, growth, and, development, including, embryogenesis, the, regulation, of, organ, size, pathogen, defense, stress, tolerance, and, reproductive, development, unlike, in, animals, in, which, hormone, production, is, restricted, to, specialized, glands, each, plant, cell, is, capable, of, producing, hormones, went, and, thimann, coined, the, term, phytohormone, and, used, it, in, the, title, of, their, 1937, book, phytohormones, occur, across, the, plant, kingdom, and, even, in, algae, where, they, have, similar, functions, to, those, seen, in, vascular, plants, higher, plants, some, phytohormones, also, occur, in, microorganisms, such, as, unicellular, fungi, and, bacteria, however, in, these, cases, they, do, not, play, a, hormonal, role, and, can, better, be, regarded, as, secondary, metabolites, the, word, hormone, is, derived, from, greek, meaning, set, in, motion, plant, hormones, affect, gene, expression, and, transcription, levels, cellular, division, and, growth, they, are, naturally, produced, within, plants, though, very, similar, chemicals, are, produced, by, fungi, and, bacteria, that, can, also, affect, plant, growth, a, large, number, of, related, chemical, compounds, are, synthesized, by, humans, they, are, used, to, regulate, the, growth, of, cultivated, plants, weeds, and, in, vitro, grown, plants, and, plant, cells, these, manmade, compounds, are, called, plant, growth, regulators, pgrs, early, in, the, study, of, plant, hormones, phytohormone, was, the, commonly, used, term, but, its, use, is, less, widely, applied, now, plant, hormones, are, not, nutrients, but, chemicals, that, in, small, amounts, promote, and, influence, the, growth, development, and, differentiation, of, cells, and, tissues, the, biosynthesis, of, plant, hormones, within, plant, tissues, is, often, diffuse, and, not, always, localized, plants, lack, glands, to, produce, and, store, hormones, because, unlike, animals, which, have, two, circulatory, systems, lymphatic, and, cardiovascular, powered, by, a, heart, that, moves, fluids, around, the, body, plants, use, more, passive, means, to, move, chemicals, around, their, bodies, plants, utilize, simple, chemicals, as, hormones, which, move, more, easily, through, their, tissues, they, are, often, produced, and, used, on, a, local, basis, within, the, plant, body, plant, cells, produce, hormones, that, affect, even, different, regions, of, the, cell, producing, the, hormone, hormones, are, transported, within, the, plant, by, utilizing, four, types, of, movements, for, localized, movement, cytoplasmic, streaming, within, cells, and, slow, diffusion, of, ions, and, molecules, between, cells, are, utilized, vascular, tissues, are, used, to, move, hormones, from, one, part, of, the, plant, to, another, these, include, sieve, tubes, or, phloem, that, move, sugars, from, the, leaves, to, the, roots, and, flowers, and, xylem, that, moves, water, and, mineral, solutes, from, the, roots, to, the, foliage, not, all, plant, cells, respond, to, hormones, but, those, cells, that, do, are, programmed, to, respond, at, specific, points, in, their, growth, cycle, the, greatest, effects, occur, at, specific, stages, during, the, cell, s, life, with, diminished, effects, occurring, before, or, after, this, period, plants, need, hormones, at, very, specific, times, during, plant, growth, and, at, specific, locations, they, also, need, to, disengage, the, effects, that, hormones, have, when, they, are, no, longer, needed, the, production, of, hormones, occurs, very, often, at, sites, of, active, growth, within, the, meristems, before, cells, have, fully, differentiated, after, production, they, are, sometimes, moved, to, other, parts, of, the, plant, where, they, cause, an, immediate, effect, or, they, can, be, stored, in, cells, to, be, released, later, plants, use, different, pathways, to, regulate, internal, hormone, quantities, and, moderate, their, effects, they, can, regulate, the, amount, of, chemicals, used, to, biosynthesize, hormones, they, can, store, them, in, cells, inactivate, them, or, cannibalise, already, formed, hormones, by, conjugating, them, with, carbohydrates, amino, acids, or, peptides, plants, can, also, break, down, hormones, chemically, effectively, destroying, them, plant, hormones, frequently, regulate, the, concentrations, of, other, plant, hormones, plants, also, move, hormones, around, the, plant, diluting, their, concentrations, the, concentration, of, hormones, required, for, plant, responses, are, very, low, 10, 6, to, 10, 5, mol, l, because, of, these, low, concentrations, it, has, been, very, difficult, to, study, plant, hormones, and, only, since, the, late, 1970s, have, scientists, been, able, to, start, piecing, together, their, effects, and, relationships, to, plant, physiology, much, of, the, early, work, on, plant, hormones, involved, studying, plants, that, were, genetically, deficient, in, one, or, involved, the, use, of, tissue, cultured, plants, grown, in, vitro, that, were, subjected, to, differing, ratios, of, hormones, and, the, resultant, growth, compared, the, earliest, scientific, observation, and, study, dates, to, the, 1880s, the, determination, and, observation, of, plant, hormones, and, their, identification, was, spread, out, over, the, next, 70, years, synergism, in, plant, hormones, refers, to, the, how, of, two, or, more, hormones, result, in, an, effect, that, is, more, than, the, individual, effects, for, example, auxins, and, cytokinins, often, act, in, cooperation, during, cellular, division, and, differentiation, both, hormones, are, key, to, cell, cycle, regulation, but, when, they, come, together, their, synergistic, interactions, can, enhance, cell, proliferation, and, organogenesis, more, effectively, than, either, could, in, isolation, different, hormones, can, be, sorted, into, different, classes, depending, on, their, chemical, structures, within, each, class, of, hormone, chemical, structures, can, vary, but, all, members, of, the, same, class, have, similar, physiological, effects, initial, research, into, plant, hormones, identified, five, major, classes, abscisic, acid, auxins, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, and, ethylene, this, list, was, later, expanded, and, brassinosteroids, jasmonates, salicylic, acid, and, strigolactones, are, now, also, considered, major, plant, hormones, additionally, there, are, several, other, compounds, that, serve, functions, similar, to, the, major, hormones, but, their, status, as, bona, fide, hormones, is, still, debated, abscisic, acid, also, called, aba, is, one, of, the, most, important, plant, growth, inhibitors, it, was, discovered, and, researched, under, two, different, names, dormin, and, abscicin, ii, before, its, chemical, properties, were, fully, known, once, it, was, determined, that, the, two, compounds, are, the, same, it, was, named, abscisic, acid, the, name, refers, to, the, fact, that, it, is, found, in, high, concentrations, in, newly, abscissed, or, freshly, fallen, leaves, this, class, of, pgr, is, composed, of, one, chemical, compound, normally, produced, in, the, leaves, of, plants, originating, from, chloroplasts, especially, when, plants, are, under, stress, in, general, it, acts, as, an, inhibitory, chemical, compound, that, affects, bud, growth, and, seed, and, bud, dormancy, it, mediates, changes, within, the, apical, meristem, causing, bud, dormancy, and, the, alteration, of, the, last, set, of, leaves, into, protective, bud, covers, since, it, was, found, in, freshly, abscissed, leaves, it, was, initially, thought, to, play, a, role, in, the, processes, of, natural, leaf, drop, but, further, research, has, disproven, this, in, plant, species, from, temperate, parts, of, the, world, abscisic, acid, plays, a, role, in, leaf, and, seed, dormancy, by, inhibiting, growth, but, as, it, is, dissipated, from, seeds, or, buds, growth, begins, in, other, plants, as, aba, levels, decrease, growth, then, commences, as, gibberellin, levels, increase, without, aba, buds, and, seeds, would, start, to, grow, during, warm, periods, in, winter, and, would, be, killed, when, it, froze, again, since, aba, dissipates, slowly, from, the, tissues, and, its, effects, take, time, to, be, offset, by, other, plant, hormones, there, is, a, delay, in, physiological, pathways, that, provides, some, protection, from, premature, growth, abscisic, acid, accumulates, within, seeds, during, fruit, maturation, preventing, seed, germination, within, the, fruit, or, before, winter, abscisic, acid, s, effects, are, degraded, within, plant, tissues, during, cold, temperatures, or, by, its, removal, by, water, washing, in, and, out, of, the, tissues, releasing, the, seeds, and, buds, from, dormancy, aba, exists, in, all, parts, of, the, plant, and, its, concentration, within, any, tissue, seems, to, mediate, its, effects, and, function, as, a, hormone, its, degradation, or, more, properly, catabolism, within, the, plant, affects, metabolic, reactions, and, cellular, growth, and, production, of, other, hormones, plants, start, life, as, a, seed, with, high, aba, levels, just, before, the, seed, germinates, aba, levels, decrease, during, germination, and, early, growth, of, the, seedling, aba, levels, decrease, even, more, as, plants, begin, to, produce, shoots, with, fully, functional, leaves, aba, levels, begin, to, increase, again, slowing, down, cellular, growth, in, more, mature, areas, of, the, plant, stress, from, water, or, predation, affects, aba, production, and, catabolism, rates, mediating, another, cascade, of, effects, that, trigger, specific, responses, from, targeted, cells, scientists, are, still, piecing, together, the, complex, interactions, and, effects, of, this, and, other, phytohormones, in, plants, under, water, stress, aba, plays, a, role, in, closing, the, stomata, soon, after, plants, are, water, stressed, and, the, roots, are, deficient, in, water, a, signal, moves, up, to, the, leaves, causing, the, formation, of, aba, precursors, there, which, then, move, to, the, roots, the, roots, then, release, aba, which, is, translocated, to, the, foliage, through, the, vascular, system, and, modulates, potassium, and, sodium, uptake, within, the, guard, cells, which, then, lose, turgidity, closing, the, stomata, auxins, are, compounds, that, positively, influence, cell, enlargement, bud, formation, and, root, initiation, they, also, promote, the, production, of, other, hormones, and, in, conjunction, with, cytokinins, control, the, growth, of, stems, roots, and, fruits, and, convert, stems, into, flowers, auxins, were, the, first, class, of, growth, regulators, discovered, a, dutch, biologist, frits, warmolt, went, first, described, auxins, they, affect, cell, elongation, by, altering, cell, wall, plasticity, they, stimulate, cambium, a, subtype, of, meristem, cells, to, divide, and, in, stems, cause, secondary, xylem, to, differentiate, auxins, act, to, inhibit, the, growth, of, buds, lower, down, the, stems, in, a, phenomenon, known, as, apical, dominance, and, also, to, promote, lateral, and, adventitious, root, development, and, growth, leaf, abscission, is, initiated, by, the, growing, point, of, a, plant, ceasing, to, produce, auxins, auxins, in, seeds, regulate, specific, protein, synthesis, as, they, develop, within, the, flower, after, pollination, causing, the, flower, to, develop, a, fruit, to, contain, the, developing, seeds, in, large, concentrations, auxins, are, often, toxic, to, plants, they, are, most, toxic, to, dicots, and, less, so, to, monocots, because, of, this, property, synthetic, auxin, herbicides, including, 2, 4, dichlorophenoxyacetic, acid, 2, 4, d, and, 2, 4, 5, trichlorophenoxyacetic, acid, 2, 4, 5, t, have, been, developed, and, used, for, weed, control, by, defoliation, auxins, especially, 1, naphthaleneacetic, acid, naa, and, indole, 3, butyric, acid, iba, are, also, commonly, applied, to, stimulate, root, growth, when, taking, cuttings, of, plants, the, most, common, auxin, found, in, plants, is, indole, 3, acetic, acid, iaa, brassinosteroids, brs, are, a, class, of, polyhydroxysteroids, the, only, example, of, steroid, based, hormones, in, plants, brassinosteroids, control, cell, elongation, and, division, gravitropism, resistance, to, stress, and, xylem, differentiation, they, inhibit, root, growth, and, leaf, abscission, brassinolide, was, the, first, brassinosteroid, to, be, identified, and, was, isolated, from, extracts, of, rapeseed, brassica, napus, pollen, in, 1979, brassinosteroids, are, a, class, of, steroidal, phytohormones, in, plants, that, regulate, numerous, physiological, processes, this, plant, hormone, was, identified, by, mitchell, et, al, who, extracted, ingredients, from, brassica, pollen, only, to, find, that, the, extracted, ingredients, main, active, component, was, brassinolide, this, finding, meant, the, discovery, of, a, new, class, of, plant, hormones, called, brassinosteroids, these, hormones, act, very, similarly, to, animal, steroidal, hormones, by, promoting, growth, and, development, in, plants, these, steroidal, hormones, play, an, important, role, in, cell, elongation, via, br, signaling, the, brassinosteroids, receptor, brassinosteroid, insensitive, 1, bri1, is, the, main, receptor, for, this, signaling, pathway, this, bri1, receptor, was, found, by, clouse, et, al, who, made, the, discovery, by, inhibiting, br, and, comparing, it, to, the, wildtype, in, arabidopsis, the, bri1, mutant, displayed, several, problems, associated, with, growth, and, development, such, as, dwarfism, reduced, cell, elongation, and, other, physical, alterations, these, findings, mean, that, plants, properly, expressing, brassinosteroids, grow, more, than, their, mutant, counterparts, brassinosteroids, bind, to, bri1, localized, at, the, plasma, membrane, which, leads, to, a, signal, cascade, that, further, regulates, cell, elongation, this, signal, cascade, however, is, not, entirely, understood, at, this, time, what, is, believed, to, be, happening, is, that, br, binds, to, the, bak1, complex, which, leads, to, a, phosphorylation, cascade, this, phosphorylation, cascade, then, causes, bin2, to, be, deactivated, which, causes, the, release, of, transcription, factors, these, released, transcription, factors, then, bind, to, dna, that, leads, to, growth, and, developmental, processes, and, allows, plants, to, respond, to, abiotic, stressors, cytokinins, cks, are, a, group, of, chemicals, that, influence, cell, division, and, shoot, formation, they, also, help, delay, senescence, of, tissues, are, responsible, for, mediating, auxin, transport, throughout, the, plant, and, affect, internodal, length, and, leaf, growth, they, were, called, kinins, in, the, past, when, they, were, first, isolated, from, yeast, cells, cytokinins, and, auxins, often, work, together, and, the, ratios, of, these, two, groups, of, plant, hormones, affect, most, major, growth, periods, during, a, plant, s, lifetime, cytokinins, counter, the, apical, dominance, induced, by, auxins, in, conjunction, with, ethylene, they, promote, abscission, of, leaves, flower, parts, and, fruits, among, the, plant, hormones, the, three, that, are, known, to, help, with, immunological, interactions, are, ethylene, et, salicylates, sa, and, jasmonates, ja, however, more, research, has, gone, into, identifying, the, role, that, cytokinins, play, in, this, evidence, suggests, that, cytokinins, delay, the, interactions, with, pathogens, showing, signs, that, they, could, induce, resistance, toward, these, pathogenic, bacteria, accordingly, there, are, higher, ck, levels, in, plants, that, have, increased, resistance, to, pathogens, compared, to, those, which, are, more, susceptible, for, example, pathogen, resistance, involving, cytokinins, was, tested, using, the, arabidopsis, species, by, treating, them, with, naturally, occurring, ck, trans, zeatin, to, see, their, response, to, the, bacteria, pseudomonas, syringa, tobacco, studies, reveal, that, over, expression, of, ck, inducing, ipt, genes, yields, increased, resistance, whereas, over, expression, of, ck, oxidase, yields, increased, susceptibility, to, pathogen, namely, p, syringae, while, there, s, not, much, of, a, relationship, between, this, hormone, and, physical, plant, behavior, there, are, behavioral, changes, that, go, on, inside, the, plant, in, response, to, it, cytokinin, defense, effects, can, include, the, establishment, and, growth, of, microbes, delay, leaf, senescence, reconfiguration, of, secondary, metabolism, or, even, induce, the, production, of, new, organs, such, as, galls, or, nodules, these, organs, and, their, corresponding, processes, are, all, used, to, protect, the, plants, against, biotic, abiotic, factors, unlike, the, other, major, plant, hormones, ethylene, is, a, gas, and, a, very, simple, organic, compound, consisting, of, just, six, atoms, it, forms, through, the, breakdown, of, methionine, an, amino, acid, which, is, in, all, cells, ethylene, has, very, limited, solubility, in, water, and, therefore, does, not, accumulate, within, the, cell, typically, diffusing, out, of, the, cell, and, escaping, the, plant, its, effectiveness, as, a, plant, hormone, is, dependent, on, its, rate, of, production, versus, its, rate, of, escaping, into, the, atmosphere, ethylene, is, produced, at, a, faster, rate, in, rapidly, growing, and, dividing, cells, especially, in, darkness, new, growth, and, newly, germinated, seedlings, produce, more, ethylene, than, can, escape, the, plant, which, leads, to, elevated, amounts, of, ethylene, inhibiting, leaf, expansion, see, hyponastic, response, as, the, new, shoot, is, exposed, to, light, reactions, mediated, by, phytochrome, in, the, plant, s, cells, produce, a, signal, for, ethylene, production, to, decrease, allowing, leaf, expansion, ethylene, affects, cell, growth, and, cell, shape, when, a, growing, shoot, or, root, hits, an, obstacle, while, underground, ethylene, production, greatly, increases, preventing, cell, elongation, and, causing, the, stem, to, swell, the, resulting, thicker, stem, is, stronger, and, less, likely, to, buckle, under, pressure, as, it, presses, against, the, object, impeding, its, path, to, the, surface, if, the, shoot, does, not, reach, the, surface, and, the, ethylene, stimulus, becomes, prolonged, it, affects, the, stem, s, natural, geotropic, response, which, is, to, grow, upright, allowing, it, to, grow, around, an, object, studies, seem, to, indicate, that, ethylene, affects, stem, diameter, and, height, when, stems, of, trees, are, subjected, to, wind, causing, lateral, stress, greater, ethylene, production, occurs, resulting, in, thicker, sturdier, tree, trunks, and, branches, ethylene, also, affects, fruit, ripening, normally, when, the, seeds, are, mature, ethylene, production, increases, and, builds, up, within, the, fruit, resulting, in, a, climacteric, event, just, before, seed, dispersal, the, nuclear, protein, ethylene, insensitive2, ein2, is, regulated, by, ethylene, production, and, in, turn, regulates, other, hormones, including, aba, and, stress, hormones, ethylene, diffusion, out, of, plants, is, strongly, inhibited, underwater, this, increases, internal, concentrations, of, the, gas, in, numerous, aquatic, and, semi, aquatic, species, e, g, callitriche, platycarpus, rice, and, rumex, palustris, the, accumulated, ethylene, strongly, stimulates, upward, elongation, this, response, is, an, important, mechanism, for, the, adaptive, escape, from, submergence, that, avoids, asphyxiation, by, returning, the, shoot, and, leaves, to, contact, with, the, air, whilst, allowing, the, release, of, entrapped, ethylene, at, least, one, species, potamogeton, pectinatus, has, been, found, to, be, incapable, of, making, ethylene, while, retaining, a, conventional, morphology, this, suggests, ethylene, is, a, true, regulator, rather, than, being, a, requirement, for, building, a, plant, s, basic, body, plan, gibberellins, gas, include, a, large, range, of, chemicals, that, are, produced, naturally, within, plants, and, by, fungi, they, were, first, discovered, when, japanese, researchers, including, eiichi, kurosawa, noticed, a, chemical, produced, by, a, fungus, called, gibberella, fujikuroi, that, produced, abnormal, growth, in, rice, plants, it, was, later, discovered, that, gas, are, also, produced, by, the, plants, themselves, and, control, multiple, aspects, of, development, across, the, life, cycle, the, synthesis, of, ga, is, strongly, upregulated, in, seeds, at, germination, and, its, presence, is, required, for, germination, to, occur, in, seedlings, and, adults, gas, strongly, promote, cell, elongation, gas, also, promote, the, transition, between, vegetative, and, reproductive, growth, and, are, also, required, for, pollen, function, during, fertilization, gibberellins, breaks, the, dormancy, in, active, stage, in, seeds, and, buds, and, helps, increasing, the, height, of, the, plant, it, helps, in, the, growth, of, the, stem, jasmonates, jas, are, lipid, based, hormones, that, were, originally, isolated, from, jasmine, oil, jas, are, especially, important, in, the, plant, response, to, attack, from, herbivores, and, necrotrophic, pathogens, the, most, active, ja, in, plants, is, jasmonic, acid, jasmonic, acid, can, be, further, metabolized, into, methyl, jasmonate, meja, which, is, a, volatile, organic, compound, this, unusual, property, means, that, meja, can, act, as, an, airborne, signal, to, communicate, herbivore, attack, to, other, distant, leaves, within, one, plant, and, even, as, a, signal, to, neighboring, plants, in, addition, to, their, role, in, defense, jas, are, also, believed, to, play, roles, in, seed, germination, the, storage, of, protein, in, seeds, and, root, growth, jas, have, been, shown, to, interact, in, the, signalling, pathway, of, other, hormones, in, a, mechanism, described, as, crosstalk, the, hormone, classes, can, have, both, negative, and, positive, effects, on, each, other, s, signal, processes, jasmonic, acid, methyl, ester, jame, has, been, shown, to, regulate, genetic, expression, in, plants, they, act, in, signalling, pathways, in, response, to, herbivory, and, upregulate, expression, of, defense, genes, jasmonyl, isoleucine, ja, ile, accumulates, in, response, to, herbivory, which, causes, an, upregulation, in, defense, gene, expression, by, freeing, up, transcription, factors, jasmonate, mutants, are, more, readily, consumed, by, herbivores, than, wild, type, plants, indicating, that, jas, play, an, important, role, in, the, execution, of, plant, defense, when, herbivores, are, moved, around, leaves, of, wild, type, plants, they, reach, similar, masses, to, herbivores, that, consume, only, mutant, plants, implying, the, effects, of, jas, are, localized, to, sites, of, herbivory, studies, have, shown, that, there, is, significant, crosstalk, between, defense, pathways, salicylic, acid, sa, is, a, hormone, with, a, structure, related, to, benzoic, acid, and, phenol, it, was, originally, isolated, from, an, extract, of, white, willow, bark, salix, alba, and, is, of, great, interest, to, human, medicine, as, it, is, the, precursor, of, the, painkiller, aspirin, in, plants, sa, plays, a, critical, role, in, the, defense, against, biotrophic, pathogens, in, a, similar, manner, to, ja, sa, can, also, become, methylated, like, meja, methyl, salicylate, is, volatile, and, can, act, as, a, long, distance, signal, to, neighboring, plants, to, warn, of, pathogen, attack, in, addition, to, its, role, in, defense, sa, is, also, involved, in, the, response, of, plants, to, abiotic, stress, particularly, from, drought, extreme, temperatures, heavy, metals, and, osmotic, stress, salicylic, acid, sa, serves, as, a, key, hormone, in, plant, innate, immunity, including, resistance, in, both, local, and, systemic, tissue, upon, biotic, attacks, hypersensitive, responses, and, cell, death, some, of, the, sa, influences, on, plants, include, seed, germination, cell, growth, respiration, stomatal, closure, senescence, associated, gene, expression, responses, to, abiotic, and, biotic, stresses, basal, thermo, tolerance, and, fruit, yield, a, possible, role, of, salicylic, acid, in, signaling, disease, resistance, was, first, demonstrated, by, injecting, leaves, of, resistant, tobacco, with, sa, the, result, was, that, injecting, sa, stimulated, pathogenesis, related, pr, protein, accumulation, and, enhanced, resistance, to, tobacco, mosaic, virus, tmv, infection, exposure, to, pathogens, causes, a, cascade, of, reactions, in, the, plant, cells, sa, biosynthesis, is, increased, via, isochorismate, synthase, ics, and, phenylalanine, ammonia, lyase, pal, pathway, in, plastids, it, was, observed, that, during, plant, microbe, interactions, as, part, of, the, defense, mechanisms, sa, is, initially, accumulated, at, the, local, infected, tissue, and, then, spread, all, over, the, plant, to, induce, systemic, acquired, resistance, at, non, infected, distal, parts, of, the, plant, therefore, with, increased, internal, concentration, of, sa, plants, were, able, to, build, resistant, barriers, for, pathogens, and, other, adverse, environmental, conditions, strigolactones, sls, were, originally, discovered, through, studies, of, the, germination, of, the, parasitic, weed, striga, lutea, it, was, found, that, the, germination, of, striga, species, was, stimulated, by, the, presence, of, a, compound, exuded, by, the, roots, of, its, host, plant, it, was, later, shown, that, sls, that, are, exuded, into, the, soil, also, promote, the, growth, of, symbiotic, arbuscular, mycorrhizal, am, fungi, more, recently, another, role, of, sls, was, identified, in, the, inhibition, of, shoot, branching, this, discovery, of, the, role, of, sls, in, shoot, branching, led, to, a, dramatic, increase, in, the, interest, in, these, hormones, and, it, has, since, been, shown, that, sls, play, important, roles, in, leaf, senescence, phosphate, starvation, response, salt, tolerance, and, light, signalling, other, identified, plant, growth, regulators, include, synthetic, plant, hormones, or, pgrs, are, used, in, a, number, of, different, techniques, involving, plant, propagation, from, cuttings, grafting, micropropagation, and, tissue, culture, most, commonly, they, are, commercially, available, as, rooting, hormone, powder, the, propagation, of, plants, by, cuttings, of, fully, developed, leaves, stems, or, roots, is, performed, by, gardeners, utilizing, auxin, as, a, rooting, compound, applied, to, the, cut, surface, the, auxins, are, taken, into, the, plant, and, promote, root, initiation, in, grafting, auxin, promotes, callus, tissue, formation, which, joins, the, surfaces, of, the, graft, together, in, micropropagation, different, pgrs, are, used, to, promote, multiplication, and, then, rooting, of, new, plantlets, in, the, tissue, culturing, of, plant, cells, pgrs, are, used, to, produce, callus, growth, multiplication, and, rooting, when, used, in, field, conditions, plant, hormones, or, mixtures, that, include, them, can, be, applied, as, biostimulants, plant, hormones, affect, seed, germination, and, dormancy, by, acting, on, different, parts, of, the, seed, embryo, dormancy, is, characterized, by, a, high, aba, ga, ratio, whereas, the, seed, has, high, abscisic, acid, sensitivity, and, low, ga, sensitivity, in, order, to, release, the, seed, from, this, type, of, dormancy, and, initiate, seed, germination, an, alteration, in, hormone, biosynthesis, and, degradation, toward, a, low, aba, ga, ratio, along, with, a, decrease, in, aba, sensitivity, and, an, increase, in, ga, sensitivity, must, occur, aba, controls, embryo, dormancy, and, ga, embryo, germination, seed, coat, dormancy, involves, the, mechanical, restriction, of, the, seed, coat, this, along, with, a, low, embryo, growth, potential, effectively, produces, seed, dormancy, ga, releases, this, dormancy, by, increasing, the, embryo, growth, potential, and, or, weakening, the, seed, coat, so, the, radical, of, the, seedling, can, break, through, the, seed, coat, different, types, of, seed, coats, can, be, made, up, of, living, or, dead, cells, and, both, types, can, be, influenced, by, hormones, those, composed, of, living, cells, are, acted, upon, after, seed, formation, whereas, the, seed, coats, composed, of, dead, cells, can, be, influenced, by, hormones, during, the, formation, of, the, seed, coat, aba, affects, testa, or, seed, coat, growth, characteristics, including, thickness, and, effects, the, ga, mediated, embryo, growth, potential, these, conditions, and, effects, occur, during, the, formation, of, the, seed, often, in, response, to, environmental, conditions, hormones, also, mediate, endosperm, dormancy, endosperm, in, most, seeds, is, composed, of, living, tissue, that, can, actively, respond, to, hormones, generated, by, the, embryo, the, endosperm, often, acts, as, a, barrier, to, seed, germination, playing, a, part, in, seed, coat, dormancy, or, in, the, germination, process, living, cells, respond, to, and, also, affect, the, aba, ga, ratio, and, mediate, cellular, sensitivity, ga, thus, increases, the, embryo, growth, potential, and, can, promote, endosperm, weakening, ga, also, affects, both, aba, independent, and, aba, inhibiting, processes, within, the, endosperm, willow, bark, has, been, used, for, centuries, as, a, painkiller, the, active, ingredient, in, willow, bark, that, provides, these, effects, is, the, hormone, salicylic, acid, sa, in, 1899, the, pharmaceutical, company, bayer, began, marketing, a, derivative, of, sa, as, the, drug, aspirin, in, addition, to, its, use, as, a, painkiller, sa, is, also, used, in, topical, treatments, of, several, skin, conditions, including, acne, warts, and, psoriasis, another, derivative, of, sa, sodium, salicylate, has, been, found, to, suppress, proliferation, of, lymphoblastic, leukemia, prostate, breast, and, melanoma, human, cancer, cells, jasmonic, acid, ja, can, induce, death, in, lymphoblastic, leukemia, cells, methyl, jasmonate, a, derivative, of, ja, also, found, in, plants, has, been, shown, to, inhibit, proliferation, in, a, number, of, cancer, cell, lines, although, there, is, still, debate, over, its, use, as, an, anti, cancer, drug, due, to, its, potential, negative, effects, on, healthy, cells
