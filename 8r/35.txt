paleontology, p, e, l, i, n, t, l, d, i, p, l, i, n, pay, lee, on, tol, jee, pal, ee, n, also, spelled, palaeontology, or, pal, ontology, is, the, scientific, study, of, life, that, existed, prior, to, the, start, of, the, holocene, epoch, roughly, 11, 700, years, before, present, it, includes, the, study, of, fossils, to, classify, organisms, and, study, their, interactions, with, each, other, and, their, environments, their, paleoecology, paleontological, observations, have, been, documented, as, far, back, as, the, 5th, century, bc, the, science, became, established, in, the, 18th, century, as, a, result, of, georges, cuvier, s, work, on, comparative, anatomy, and, developed, rapidly, in, the, 19th, century, the, term, has, been, used, since, 1822, formed, from, greek, palaios, old, ancient, on, gen, ontos, being, creature, and, logos, speech, thought, study, paleontology, lies, on, the, border, between, biology, and, geology, but, it, differs, from, archaeology, in, that, it, excludes, the, study, of, anatomically, modern, humans, it, now, uses, techniques, drawn, from, a, wide, range, of, sciences, including, biochemistry, mathematics, and, engineering, use, of, all, these, techniques, has, enabled, paleontologists, to, discover, much, of, the, evolutionary, history, of, life, almost, back, to, when, earth, became, capable, of, supporting, life, nearly, 4, billion, years, ago, as, knowledge, has, increased, paleontology, has, developed, specialised, sub, divisions, some, of, which, focus, on, different, types, of, fossil, organisms, while, others, study, ecology, and, environmental, history, such, as, ancient, climates, body, fossils, and, trace, fossils, are, the, principal, types, of, evidence, about, ancient, life, and, geochemical, evidence, has, helped, to, decipher, the, evolution, of, life, before, there, were, organisms, large, enough, to, leave, body, fossils, estimating, the, dates, of, these, remains, is, essential, but, difficult, sometimes, adjacent, rock, layers, allow, radiometric, dating, which, provides, absolute, dates, that, are, accurate, to, within, 0, 5, but, more, often, paleontologists, have, to, rely, on, relative, dating, by, solving, the, jigsaw, puzzles, of, biostratigraphy, arrangement, of, rock, layers, from, youngest, to, oldest, classifying, ancient, organisms, is, also, difficult, as, many, do, not, fit, well, into, the, linnaean, taxonomy, classifying, living, organisms, and, paleontologists, more, often, use, cladistics, to, draw, up, evolutionary, family, trees, the, final, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, saw, the, development, of, molecular, phylogenetics, which, investigates, how, closely, organisms, are, related, by, measuring, the, similarity, of, the, dna, in, their, genomes, molecular, phylogenetics, has, also, been, used, to, estimate, the, dates, when, species, diverged, but, there, is, controversy, about, the, reliability, of, the, molecular, clock, on, which, such, estimates, depend, the, simplest, definition, of, paleontology, is, the, study, of, ancient, life, the, field, seeks, information, about, several, aspects, of, past, organisms, their, identity, and, origin, their, environment, and, evolution, and, what, they, can, tell, us, about, the, earth, s, organic, and, inorganic, past, william, whewell, 1794, 1866, classified, paleontology, as, one, of, the, historical, sciences, along, with, archaeology, geology, astronomy, cosmology, philology, and, history, itself, paleontology, aims, to, describe, phenomena, of, the, past, and, to, reconstruct, their, causes, hence, it, has, three, main, elements, description, of, past, phenomena, developing, a, general, theory, about, the, causes, of, various, types, of, change, and, applying, those, theories, to, specific, facts, when, trying, to, explain, the, past, paleontologists, and, other, historical, scientists, often, construct, a, set, of, one, or, more, hypotheses, about, the, causes, and, then, look, for, a, smoking, gun, a, piece, of, evidence, that, strongly, accords, with, one, hypothesis, over, any, others, sometimes, researchers, discover, a, smoking, gun, by, a, fortunate, accident, during, other, research, for, example, the, 1980, discovery, by, luis, and, walter, alvarez, of, iridium, a, mainly, extraterrestrial, metal, in, the, cretaceous, paleogene, boundary, layer, made, asteroid, impact, the, most, favored, explanation, for, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, although, debate, continues, about, the, contribution, of, volcanism, a, complementary, approach, to, developing, scientific, knowledge, experimental, science, is, often, said, to, work, by, conducting, experiments, to, disprove, hypotheses, about, the, workings, and, causes, of, natural, phenomena, this, approach, cannot, prove, a, hypothesis, since, some, later, experiment, may, disprove, it, but, the, accumulation, of, failures, to, disprove, is, often, compelling, evidence, in, favor, however, when, confronted, with, totally, unexpected, phenomena, such, as, the, first, evidence, for, invisible, radiation, experimental, scientists, often, use, the, same, approach, as, historical, scientists, construct, a, set, of, hypotheses, about, the, causes, and, then, look, for, a, smoking, gun, paleontology, lies, between, biology, and, geology, since, it, focuses, on, the, record, of, past, life, but, its, main, source, of, evidence, is, fossils, in, rocks, for, historical, reasons, paleontology, is, part, of, the, geology, department, at, many, universities, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, geology, departments, found, fossil, evidence, important, for, dating, rocks, while, biology, departments, showed, little, interest, paleontology, also, has, some, overlap, with, archaeology, which, primarily, works, with, objects, made, by, humans, and, with, human, remains, while, paleontologists, are, interested, in, the, characteristics, and, evolution, of, humans, as, a, species, when, dealing, with, evidence, about, humans, archaeologists, and, paleontologists, may, work, together, for, example, paleontologists, might, identify, animal, or, plant, fossils, around, an, archaeological, site, to, discover, the, people, who, lived, there, and, what, they, ate, or, they, might, analyze, the, climate, at, the, time, of, habitation, in, addition, paleontology, often, borrows, techniques, from, other, sciences, including, biology, osteology, ecology, chemistry, physics, and, mathematics, for, example, geochemical, signatures, from, rocks, may, help, to, discover, when, life, first, arose, on, earth, and, analyses, of, carbon, isotope, ratios, may, help, to, identify, climate, changes, and, even, to, explain, major, transitions, such, as, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, a, relatively, recent, discipline, molecular, phylogenetics, compares, the, dna, and, rna, of, modern, organisms, to, re, construct, the, family, trees, of, their, evolutionary, ancestors, it, has, also, been, used, to, estimate, the, dates, of, important, evolutionary, developments, although, this, approach, is, controversial, because, of, doubts, about, the, reliability, of, the, molecular, clock, techniques, from, engineering, have, been, used, to, analyse, how, the, bodies, of, ancient, organisms, might, have, worked, for, example, the, running, speed, and, bite, strength, of, tyrannosaurus, or, the, flight, mechanics, of, microraptor, it, is, relatively, commonplace, to, study, the, internal, details, of, fossils, using, x, ray, microtomography, paleontology, biology, archaeology, and, paleoneurobiology, combine, to, study, endocranial, casts, endocasts, of, species, related, to, humans, to, clarify, the, evolution, of, the, human, brain, paleontology, even, contributes, to, astrobiology, the, investigation, of, possible, life, on, other, planets, by, developing, models, of, how, life, may, have, arisen, and, by, providing, techniques, for, detecting, evidence, of, life, as, knowledge, has, increased, paleontology, has, developed, specialised, subdivisions, vertebrate, paleontology, concentrates, on, fossils, from, the, earliest, fish, to, the, immediate, ancestors, of, modern, mammals, invertebrate, paleontology, deals, with, fossils, such, as, molluscs, arthropods, annelid, worms, and, echinoderms, paleobotany, studies, fossil, plants, algae, and, fungi, palynology, the, study, of, pollen, and, spores, produced, by, land, plants, and, protists, straddles, paleontology, and, botany, as, it, deals, with, both, living, and, fossil, organisms, micropaleontology, deals, with, microscopic, fossil, organisms, of, all, kinds, instead, of, focusing, on, individual, organisms, paleoecology, examines, the, interactions, between, different, ancient, organisms, such, as, their, food, chains, and, the, two, way, interactions, with, their, environments, for, example, the, development, of, oxygenic, photosynthesis, by, bacteria, caused, the, oxygenation, of, the, atmosphere, and, hugely, increased, the, productivity, and, diversity, of, ecosystems, together, these, led, to, the, evolution, of, complex, eukaryotic, cells, from, which, all, multicellular, organisms, are, built, paleoclimatology, although, sometimes, treated, as, part, of, paleoecology, focuses, more, on, the, history, of, earth, s, climate, and, the, mechanisms, that, have, changed, it, which, have, sometimes, included, evolutionary, developments, for, example, the, rapid, expansion, of, land, plants, in, the, devonian, period, removed, more, carbon, dioxide, from, the, atmosphere, reducing, the, greenhouse, effect, and, thus, helping, to, cause, an, ice, age, in, the, carboniferous, period, biostratigraphy, the, use, of, fossils, to, work, out, the, chronological, order, in, which, rocks, were, formed, is, useful, to, both, paleontologists, and, geologists, biogeography, studies, the, spatial, distribution, of, organisms, and, is, also, linked, to, geology, which, explains, how, earth, s, geography, has, changed, over, time, fossils, of, organisms, bodies, are, usually, the, most, informative, type, of, evidence, the, most, common, types, are, wood, bones, and, shells, fossilisation, is, a, rare, event, and, most, fossils, are, destroyed, by, erosion, or, metamorphism, before, they, can, be, observed, hence, the, fossil, record, is, very, incomplete, increasingly, so, further, back, in, time, despite, this, it, is, often, adequate, to, illustrate, the, broader, patterns, of, life, s, history, there, are, also, biases, in, the, fossil, record, different, environments, are, more, favorable, to, the, preservation, of, different, types, of, organism, or, parts, of, organisms, further, only, the, parts, of, organisms, that, were, already, mineralised, are, usually, preserved, such, as, the, shells, of, molluscs, since, most, animal, species, are, soft, bodied, they, decay, before, they, can, become, fossilised, as, a, result, although, there, are, 30, plus, phyla, of, living, animals, two, thirds, have, never, been, found, as, fossils, occasionally, unusual, environments, may, preserve, soft, tissues, these, lagerst, tten, allow, paleontologists, to, examine, the, internal, anatomy, of, animals, that, in, other, sediments, are, represented, only, by, shells, spines, claws, etc, if, they, are, preserved, at, all, however, even, lagerst, tten, present, an, incomplete, picture, of, life, at, the, time, the, majority, of, organisms, living, at, the, time, are, probably, not, represented, because, lagerst, tten, are, restricted, to, a, narrow, range, of, environments, e, g, where, soft, bodied, organisms, can, be, preserved, very, quickly, by, events, such, as, mudslides, and, the, exceptional, events, that, cause, quick, burial, make, it, difficult, to, study, the, normal, environments, of, the, animals, the, sparseness, of, the, fossil, record, means, that, organisms, are, expected, to, exist, long, before, and, after, they, are, found, in, the, fossil, record, this, is, known, as, the, signor, lipps, effect, trace, fossils, consist, mainly, of, tracks, and, burrows, but, also, include, coprolites, fossil, feces, and, marks, left, by, feeding, trace, fossils, are, particularly, significant, because, they, represent, a, data, source, that, is, not, limited, to, animals, with, easily, fossilised, hard, parts, and, they, reflect, organisms, behaviours, also, many, traces, date, from, significantly, earlier, than, the, body, fossils, of, animals, that, are, thought, to, have, been, capable, of, making, them, whilst, exact, assignment, of, trace, fossils, to, their, makers, is, generally, impossible, traces, may, for, example, provide, the, earliest, physical, evidence, of, the, appearance, of, moderately, complex, animals, comparable, to, earthworms, geochemical, observations, may, help, to, deduce, the, global, level, of, biological, activity, at, a, certain, period, or, the, affinity, of, certain, fossils, for, example, geochemical, features, of, rocks, may, reveal, when, life, first, arose, on, earth, and, may, provide, evidence, of, the, presence, of, eukaryotic, cells, the, type, from, which, all, multicellular, organisms, are, built, analyses, of, carbon, isotope, ratios, may, help, to, explain, major, transitions, such, as, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, naming, groups, of, organisms, in, a, way, that, is, clear, and, widely, agreed, is, important, as, some, disputes, in, paleontology, have, been, based, just, on, misunderstandings, over, names, linnaean, taxonomy, is, commonly, used, for, classifying, living, organisms, but, runs, into, difficulties, when, dealing, with, newly, discovered, organisms, that, are, significantly, different, from, known, ones, for, example, it, is, hard, to, decide, at, what, level, to, place, a, new, higher, level, grouping, e, g, genus, or, family, or, order, this, is, important, since, the, linnaean, rules, for, naming, groups, are, tied, to, their, levels, and, hence, if, a, group, is, moved, to, a, different, level, it, must, be, renamed, amphibians, extinct, synapsids, mammals, extinct, reptiles, lizards, and, snakes, extinct, archosaurs, crocodilians, extinct, dinosaurs, birds, paleontologists, generally, use, approaches, based, on, cladistics, a, technique, for, working, out, the, evolutionary, family, tree, of, a, set, of, organisms, it, works, by, the, logic, that, if, groups, b, and, c, have, more, similarities, to, each, other, than, either, has, to, group, a, then, b, and, c, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, either, is, to, a, characters, that, are, compared, may, be, anatomical, such, as, the, presence, of, a, notochord, or, molecular, by, comparing, sequences, of, dna, or, proteins, the, result, of, a, successful, analysis, is, a, hierarchy, of, clades, groups, that, share, a, common, ancestor, ideally, the, family, tree, has, only, two, branches, leading, from, each, node, junction, but, sometimes, there, is, too, little, information, to, achieve, this, and, paleontologists, have, to, make, do, with, junctions, that, have, several, branches, the, cladistic, technique, is, sometimes, fallible, as, some, features, such, as, wings, or, camera, eyes, evolved, more, than, once, convergently, this, must, be, taken, into, account, in, analyses, evolutionary, developmental, biology, commonly, abbreviated, to, evo, devo, also, helps, paleontologists, to, produce, family, trees, and, understand, fossils, for, example, the, embryological, development, of, some, modern, brachiopods, suggests, that, brachiopods, may, be, descendants, of, the, halkieriids, which, became, extinct, in, the, cambrian, period, paleontology, seeks, to, map, out, how, living, things, have, changed, through, time, a, substantial, hurdle, to, this, aim, is, the, difficulty, of, working, out, how, old, fossils, are, beds, that, preserve, fossils, typically, lack, the, radioactive, elements, needed, for, radiometric, dating, this, technique, is, our, only, means, of, giving, rocks, greater, than, about, 50, million, years, old, an, absolute, age, and, can, be, accurate, to, within, 0, 5, or, better, although, radiometric, dating, requires, very, careful, laboratory, work, its, basic, principle, is, simple, the, rates, at, which, various, radioactive, elements, decay, are, known, and, so, the, ratio, of, the, radioactive, element, to, the, element, into, which, it, decays, shows, how, long, ago, the, radioactive, element, was, incorporated, into, the, rock, radioactive, elements, are, common, only, in, rocks, with, a, volcanic, origin, and, so, the, only, fossil, bearing, rocks, that, can, be, dated, radiometrically, are, a, few, volcanic, ash, layers, consequently, paleontologists, must, usually, rely, on, stratigraphy, to, date, fossils, stratigraphy, is, the, science, of, deciphering, the, layer, cake, that, is, the, sedimentary, record, and, has, been, compared, to, a, jigsaw, puzzle, rocks, normally, form, relatively, horizontal, layers, with, each, layer, younger, than, the, one, underneath, it, if, a, fossil, is, found, between, two, layers, whose, ages, are, known, the, fossil, s, age, must, lie, between, the, two, known, ages, because, rock, sequences, are, not, continuous, but, may, be, broken, up, by, faults, or, periods, of, erosion, it, is, very, difficult, to, match, up, rock, beds, that, are, not, directly, next, to, one, another, however, fossils, of, species, that, survived, for, a, relatively, short, time, can, be, used, to, link, up, isolated, rocks, this, technique, is, called, biostratigraphy, for, instance, the, conodont, eoplacognathus, pseudoplanus, has, a, short, range, in, the, middle, ordovician, period, if, rocks, of, unknown, age, are, found, to, have, traces, of, e, pseudoplanus, they, must, have, a, mid, ordovician, age, such, index, fossils, must, be, distinctive, be, globally, distributed, and, have, a, short, time, range, to, be, useful, however, misleading, results, are, produced, if, the, index, fossils, turn, out, to, have, longer, fossil, ranges, than, first, thought, stratigraphy, and, biostratigraphy, can, in, general, provide, only, relative, dating, a, was, before, b, which, is, often, sufficient, for, studying, evolution, however, this, is, difficult, for, some, time, periods, because, of, the, problems, involved, in, matching, up, rocks, of, the, same, age, across, different, continents, family, tree, relationships, may, also, help, to, narrow, down, the, date, when, lineages, first, appeared, for, instance, if, fossils, of, b, or, c, date, to, x, million, years, ago, and, the, calculated, family, tree, says, a, was, an, ancestor, of, b, and, c, then, a, must, have, evolved, more, than, x, million, years, ago, it, is, also, possible, to, estimate, how, long, ago, two, living, clades, diverged, i, e, approximately, how, long, ago, their, last, common, ancestor, must, have, lived, by, assuming, that, dna, mutations, accumulate, at, a, constant, rate, these, molecular, clocks, however, are, fallible, and, provide, only, a, very, approximate, timing, for, example, they, are, not, sufficiently, precise, and, reliable, for, estimating, when, the, groups, that, feature, in, the, cambrian, explosion, first, evolved, and, estimates, produced, by, different, techniques, may, vary, by, a, factor, of, two, earth, formed, about, 4, 570, million, years, ago, and, after, a, collision, that, formed, the, moon, about, 40, million, years, later, may, have, cooled, quickly, enough, to, have, oceans, and, an, atmosphere, about, 4, 440, million, years, ago, there, is, evidence, on, the, moon, of, a, late, heavy, bombardment, by, asteroids, from, 4, 000, to, 3, 800, million, years, ago, if, as, seems, likely, such, a, bombardment, struck, earth, at, the, same, time, the, first, atmosphere, and, oceans, may, have, been, stripped, away, paleontology, traces, the, evolutionary, history, of, life, back, to, over, 3, 000, million, years, ago, possibly, as, far, as, 3, 800, million, years, ago, the, oldest, clear, evidence, of, life, on, earth, dates, to, 3, 000, million, years, ago, although, there, have, been, reports, often, disputed, of, fossil, bacteria, from, 3, 400, million, years, ago, and, of, geochemical, evidence, for, the, presence, of, life, 3, 800, million, years, ago, some, scientists, have, proposed, that, life, on, earth, was, seeded, from, elsewhere, but, most, research, concentrates, on, various, explanations, of, how, life, could, have, arisen, independently, on, earth, for, about, 2, 000, million, years, microbial, mats, multi, layered, colonies, of, different, bacteria, were, the, dominant, life, on, earth, the, evolution, of, oxygenic, photosynthesis, enabled, them, to, play, the, major, role, in, the, oxygenation, of, the, atmosphere, from, about, 2, 400, million, years, ago, this, change, in, the, atmosphere, increased, their, effectiveness, as, nurseries, of, evolution, while, eukaryotes, cells, with, complex, internal, structures, may, have, been, present, earlier, their, evolution, speeded, up, when, they, acquired, the, ability, to, transform, oxygen, from, a, poison, to, a, powerful, source, of, metabolic, energy, this, innovation, may, have, come, from, primitive, eukaryotes, capturing, oxygen, powered, bacteria, as, endosymbionts, and, transforming, them, into, organelles, called, mitochondria, the, earliest, evidence, of, complex, eukaryotes, with, organelles, such, as, mitochondria, dates, from, 1, 850, million, years, ago, multicellular, life, is, composed, only, of, eukaryotic, cells, and, the, earliest, evidence, for, it, is, the, francevillian, group, fossils, from, 2, 100, million, years, ago, although, specialisation, of, cells, for, different, functions, first, appears, between, 1, 430, million, years, ago, a, possible, fungus, and, 1, 200, million, years, ago, a, probable, red, alga, sexual, reproduction, may, be, a, prerequisite, for, specialisation, of, cells, as, an, asexual, multicellular, organism, might, be, at, risk, of, being, taken, over, by, rogue, cells, that, retain, the, ability, to, reproduce, the, earliest, known, animals, are, cnidarians, from, about, 580, million, years, ago, but, these, are, so, modern, looking, that, they, must, be, descendants, of, earlier, animals, early, fossils, of, animals, are, rare, because, they, had, not, developed, mineralised, easily, fossilized, hard, parts, until, about, 548, million, years, ago, the, earliest, modern, looking, bilaterian, animals, appear, in, the, early, cambrian, along, with, several, weird, wonders, that, bear, little, obvious, resemblance, to, any, modern, animals, there, is, a, long, running, debate, about, whether, this, cambrian, explosion, was, truly, a, very, rapid, period, of, evolutionary, experimentation, alternative, views, are, that, modern, looking, animals, began, evolving, earlier, but, fossils, of, their, precursors, have, not, yet, been, found, or, that, the, weird, wonders, are, evolutionary, aunts, and, cousins, of, modern, groups, vertebrates, remained, a, minor, group, until, the, first, jawed, fish, appeared, in, the, late, ordovician, the, spread, of, animals, and, plants, from, water, to, land, required, organisms, to, solve, several, problems, including, protection, against, drying, out, and, supporting, themselves, against, gravity, the, earliest, evidence, of, land, plants, and, land, invertebrates, date, back, to, about, 476, million, years, ago, and, 490, million, years, ago, respectively, those, invertebrates, as, indicated, by, their, trace, and, body, fossils, were, shown, to, be, arthropods, known, as, euthycarcinoids, the, lineage, that, produced, land, vertebrates, evolved, later, but, very, rapidly, between, 370, million, years, ago, and, 360, million, years, ago, recent, discoveries, have, overturned, earlier, ideas, about, the, history, and, driving, forces, behind, their, evolution, land, plants, were, so, successful, that, their, detritus, caused, an, ecological, crisis, in, the, late, devonian, until, the, evolution, of, fungi, that, could, digest, dead, wood, during, the, permian, period, synapsids, including, the, ancestors, of, mammals, may, have, dominated, land, environments, but, this, ended, with, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, 251, million, years, ago, which, came, very, close, to, wiping, out, all, complex, life, the, extinctions, were, apparently, fairly, sudden, at, least, among, vertebrates, during, the, slow, recovery, from, this, catastrophe, a, previously, obscure, group, archosaurs, became, the, most, abundant, and, diverse, terrestrial, vertebrates, one, archosaur, group, the, dinosaurs, were, the, dominant, land, vertebrates, for, the, rest, of, the, mesozoic, and, birds, evolved, from, one, group, of, dinosaurs, during, this, time, mammals, ancestors, survived, only, as, small, mainly, nocturnal, insectivores, which, may, have, accelerated, the, development, of, mammalian, traits, such, as, endothermy, and, hair, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, 66, million, years, ago, killed, off, all, the, dinosaurs, except, the, birds, mammals, increased, rapidly, in, size, and, diversity, and, some, took, to, the, air, and, the, sea, fossil, evidence, indicates, that, flowering, plants, appeared, and, rapidly, diversified, in, the, early, cretaceous, between, 130, million, years, ago, and, 90, million, years, ago, their, rapid, rise, to, dominance, of, terrestrial, ecosystems, is, thought, to, have, been, propelled, by, coevolution, with, pollinating, insects, social, insects, appeared, around, the, same, time, and, although, they, account, for, only, small, parts, of, the, insect, family, tree, now, form, over, 50, of, the, total, mass, of, all, insects, humans, evolved, from, a, lineage, of, upright, walking, apes, whose, earliest, fossils, date, from, over, 6, million, years, ago, although, early, members, of, this, lineage, had, chimp, sized, brains, about, 25, as, big, as, modern, humans, there, are, signs, of, a, steady, increase, in, brain, size, after, about, 3, million, years, ago, there, is, a, long, running, debate, about, whether, modern, humans, are, descendants, of, a, single, small, population, in, africa, which, then, migrated, all, over, the, world, less, than, 200, 000, years, ago, and, replaced, previous, hominine, species, or, arose, worldwide, at, the, same, time, as, a, result, of, interbreeding, life, on, earth, has, suffered, occasional, mass, extinctions, at, least, since, 542, million, years, ago, despite, their, disastrous, effects, mass, extinctions, have, sometimes, accelerated, the, evolution, of, life, on, earth, when, dominance, of, an, ecological, niche, passes, from, one, group, of, organisms, to, another, this, is, rarely, because, the, new, dominant, group, outcompetes, the, old, but, usually, because, an, extinction, event, allows, a, new, group, which, may, possess, an, advantageous, trait, to, outlive, the, old, and, move, into, its, niche, the, fossil, record, appears, to, show, that, the, rate, of, extinction, is, slowing, down, with, both, the, gaps, between, mass, extinctions, becoming, longer, and, the, average, and, background, rates, of, extinction, decreasing, however, it, is, not, certain, whether, the, actual, rate, of, extinction, has, altered, since, both, of, these, observations, could, be, explained, in, several, ways, biodiversity, in, the, fossil, record, which, is, shows, a, different, trend, a, fairly, swift, rise, from, 542, to, 400, million, years, ago, a, slight, decline, from, 400, to, 200, million, years, ago, in, which, the, devastating, permian, triassic, extinction, event, is, an, important, factor, and, a, swift, rise, from, 200, million, years, ago, to, the, present, although, paleontology, became, established, around, 1800, earlier, thinkers, had, noticed, aspects, of, the, fossil, record, the, ancient, greek, philosopher, xenophanes, 570, 480, bce, concluded, from, fossil, sea, shells, that, some, areas, of, land, were, once, under, water, during, the, middle, ages, the, persian, naturalist, ibn, sina, known, as, avicenna, in, europe, discussed, fossils, and, proposed, a, theory, of, petrifying, fluids, on, which, albert, of, saxony, elaborated, in, the, 14th, century, the, chinese, naturalist, shen, kuo, 1031, 1095, proposed, a, theory, of, climate, change, based, on, the, presence, of, petrified, bamboo, in, regions, that, in, his, time, were, too, dry, for, bamboo, in, early, modern, europe, the, systematic, study, of, fossils, emerged, as, an, integral, part, of, the, changes, in, natural, philosophy, that, occurred, during, the, age, of, reason, in, the, italian, renaissance, leonardo, da, vinci, made, various, significant, contributions, to, the, field, as, well, as, depicted, numerous, fossils, leonardo, s, contributions, are, central, to, the, history, of, paleontology, because, he, established, a, line, of, continuity, between, the, two, main, branches, of, paleontology, ichnology, and, body, fossil, paleontology, he, identified, the, following, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, georges, cuvier, s, work, established, comparative, anatomy, as, a, scientific, discipline, and, by, proving, that, some, fossil, animals, resembled, no, living, ones, demonstrated, that, animals, could, become, extinct, leading, to, the, emergence, of, paleontology, the, expanding, knowledge, of, the, fossil, record, also, played, an, increasing, role, in, the, development, of, geology, particularly, stratigraphy, cuvier, proved, that, the, different, levels, of, deposits, represented, different, time, periods, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, surface, level, deposits, in, the, americas, contained, later, mammals, like, the, megatheriid, ground, sloth, megatherium, and, the, mammutid, proboscidean, mammut, later, known, informally, as, a, mastodon, which, were, some, of, the, earliest, named, fossil, mammal, genera, with, official, taxonomic, authorities, they, today, are, known, to, date, to, the, neogene, quaternary, in, deeper, level, deposits, in, western, europe, are, early, aged, mammals, such, as, the, palaeothere, perissodactyl, palaeotherium, and, the, anoplotheriid, artiodactyl, anoplotherium, both, of, which, were, described, earliest, after, the, former, two, genera, which, today, are, known, to, date, to, the, paleogene, period, cuvier, figured, out, that, even, older, than, the, two, levels, of, deposits, with, extinct, large, mammals, is, one, that, contained, an, extinct, crocodile, like, marine, reptile, which, eventually, came, to, be, known, as, the, mosasaurid, mosasaurus, of, the, cretaceous, period, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, saw, geological, and, paleontological, activity, become, increasingly, well, organised, with, the, growth, of, geologic, societies, and, museums, and, an, increasing, number, of, professional, geologists, and, fossil, specialists, interest, increased, for, reasons, that, were, not, purely, scientific, as, geology, and, paleontology, helped, industrialists, to, find, and, exploit, natural, resources, such, as, coal, this, contributed, to, a, rapid, increase, in, knowledge, about, the, history, of, life, on, earth, and, to, progress, in, the, definition, of, the, geologic, time, scale, largely, based, on, fossil, evidence, although, she, was, rarely, recognised, by, the, scientific, community, mary, anning, was, a, significant, contributor, to, the, field, of, palaeontology, during, this, period, she, uncovered, multiple, novel, mesozoic, reptile, fossils, and, deducted, that, what, were, then, known, as, bezoar, stones, are, in, fact, fossilised, faeces, in, 1822, henri, marie, ducrotay, de, blainville, editor, of, journal, de, physique, coined, the, word, palaeontology, to, refer, to, the, study, of, ancient, living, organisms, through, fossils, as, knowledge, of, life, s, history, continued, to, improve, it, became, increasingly, obvious, that, there, had, been, some, kind, of, successive, order, to, the, development, of, life, this, encouraged, early, evolutionary, theories, on, the, transmutation, of, species, after, charles, darwin, published, origin, of, species, in, 1859, much, of, the, focus, of, paleontology, shifted, to, understanding, evolutionary, paths, including, human, evolution, and, evolutionary, theory, the, last, half, of, the, 19th, century, saw, a, tremendous, expansion, in, paleontological, activity, especially, in, north, america, the, trend, continued, in, the, 20th, century, with, additional, regions, of, the, earth, being, opened, to, systematic, fossil, collection, fossils, found, in, china, near, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, have, been, particularly, important, as, they, have, provided, new, information, about, the, earliest, evolution, of, animals, early, fish, dinosaurs, and, the, evolution, of, birds, the, last, few, decades, of, the, 20th, century, saw, a, renewed, interest, in, mass, extinctions, and, their, role, in, the, evolution, of, life, on, earth, there, was, also, a, renewed, interest, in, the, cambrian, explosion, that, apparently, saw, the, development, of, the, body, plans, of, most, animal, phyla, the, discovery, of, fossils, of, the, ediacaran, biota, and, developments, in, paleobiology, extended, knowledge, about, the, history, of, life, back, far, before, the, cambrian, increasing, awareness, of, gregor, mendel, s, pioneering, work, in, genetics, led, first, to, the, development, of, population, genetics, and, then, in, the, mid, 20th, century, to, the, modern, evolutionary, synthesis, which, explains, evolution, as, the, outcome, of, events, such, as, mutations, and, horizontal, gene, transfer, which, provide, genetic, variation, with, genetic, drift, and, natural, selection, driving, changes, in, this, variation, over, time, within, the, next, few, years, the, role, and, operation, of, dna, in, genetic, inheritance, were, discovered, leading, to, what, is, now, known, as, the, central, dogma, of, molecular, biology, in, the, 1960s, molecular, phylogenetics, the, investigation, of, evolutionary, family, trees, by, techniques, derived, from, biochemistry, began, to, make, an, impact, particularly, when, it, was, proposed, that, the, human, lineage, had, diverged, from, apes, much, more, recently, than, was, generally, thought, at, the, time, although, this, early, study, compared, proteins, from, apes, and, humans, most, molecular, phylogenetics, research, is, now, based, on, comparisons, of, rna, and, dna, books, catered, to, the, general, public, on, paleontology, include
