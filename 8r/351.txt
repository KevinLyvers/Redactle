a, squid, pl, squid, is, a, mollusc, with, an, elongated, soft, body, large, eyes, eight, arms, and, two, tentacles, in, the, orders, myopsida, oegopsida, and, bathyteuthida, though, many, other, molluscs, within, the, broader, neocoleoidea, are, also, called, squid, despite, not, strictly, fitting, these, criteria, like, all, other, cephalopods, squid, have, a, distinct, head, bilateral, symmetry, and, a, mantle, they, are, mainly, soft, bodied, like, octopuses, but, have, a, small, internal, skeleton, in, the, form, of, a, rod, like, gladius, or, pen, made, of, chitin, squid, diverged, from, other, cephalopods, during, the, jurassic, and, occupy, a, similar, role, to, teleost, fish, as, open, water, predators, of, similar, size, and, behaviour, they, play, an, important, role, in, the, open, water, food, web, the, two, long, tentacles, are, used, to, grab, prey, and, the, eight, arms, to, hold, and, control, it, the, beak, then, cuts, the, food, into, suitable, size, chunks, for, swallowing, squid, are, rapid, swimmers, moving, by, jet, propulsion, and, largely, locate, their, prey, by, sight, they, are, among, the, most, intelligent, of, invertebrates, with, groups, of, humboldt, squid, having, been, observed, hunting, cooperatively, they, are, preyed, on, by, sharks, other, fish, sea, birds, seals, and, cetaceans, particularly, sperm, whales, squid, can, change, colour, for, camouflage, and, signalling, some, species, are, bioluminescent, using, their, light, for, counter, illumination, camouflage, while, many, species, can, eject, a, cloud, of, ink, to, distract, predators, squid, are, used, for, human, consumption, with, commercial, fisheries, in, japan, the, mediterranean, the, southwestern, atlantic, the, eastern, pacific, and, elsewhere, they, are, used, in, cuisines, around, the, world, often, known, as, calamari, squid, have, featured, in, literature, since, classical, times, especially, in, tales, of, giant, squid, and, sea, monsters, squid, are, members, of, the, class, cephalopoda, subclass, coleoidea, the, squid, orders, myopsida, and, oegopsida, are, in, the, superorder, decapodiformes, from, the, greek, for, ten, legged, two, other, orders, of, decapodiform, cephalopods, are, also, called, squid, although, they, are, taxonomically, distinct, from, squids, and, differ, recognizably, in, their, gross, anatomical, features, they, are, the, bobtail, squid, of, order, sepiolida, and, the, ram, s, horn, squid, of, the, monotypic, order, spirulida, the, vampire, squid, vampyroteuthis, infernalis, however, is, more, closely, related, to, the, octopus, than, to, any, squid, the, cladogram, not, fully, resolved, is, based, on, sanchez, et, al, 2018, their, molecular, phylogeny, used, mitochondrial, and, nuclear, dna, marker, sequences, they, comment, that, a, robust, phylogeny, has, proven, very, challenging, to, obtain, if, it, is, accepted, that, sepiidae, cuttlefish, are, a, kind, of, squid, then, the, squids, excluding, the, vampire, squid, form, a, clade, as, illustrated, orders, are, shown, in, boldface, all, the, families, not, included, in, those, orders, are, in, the, paraphyletic, order, oegopsida, except, sepiadariidae, and, sepiidae, that, are, in, the, paraphyletic, order, sepiida, nautilus, octopoda, vampyroteuthidae, vampire, squid, cranchiinae, glass,

diverged, in, the, late, paleozoic, mississippian, according, to, fossils, of, syllipsimopodi, an, early, relative, of, vampire, squids, and, octopuses, true, squid, diverged, during, the, jurassic, but, many, squid, families, appeared, in, or, after, the, cretaceous, both, the, coleoids, and, the, teleost, fish, were, involved, in, much, adaptive, radiation, at, this, time, and, the, two, modern, groups, resemble, each, other, in, size, ecology, habitat, morphology, and, behaviour, however, some, fish, moved, into, fresh, water, while, the, coleoids, remained, in, marine, environments, the, ancestral, coleoid, was, probably, nautiloid, like, with, a, strait, septate, shell, that, became, immersed, in, the, mantle, and, was, used, for, buoyancy, control, four, lines, diverged, from, this, spirulida, with, one, living, member, the, cuttlefishes, the, squids, and, the, octopuses, squid, have, differentiated, from, the, ancestral, mollusc, such, that, the, body, plan, has, been, condensed, antero, posteriorly, and, extended, dorso, ventrally, what, may, have, been, the, foot, of, the, ancestor, is, modified, into, a, complex, set, of, appendages, around, the, mouth, the, sense, organs, are, highly, developed, and, include, advanced, eyes, similar, to, those, of, vertebrates, the, ancestral, shell, has, been, lost, with, only, an, internal, gladius, or, pen, remaining, the, pen, made, of, a, chitin, like, material, is, a, feather, shaped, internal, structure, that, supports, the, squid, s, mantle, and, serves, as, a, site, for, muscle, attachment, the, cuttlebone, or, sepion, of, the, sepiidae, is, calcareous, and, appears, to, have, evolved, afresh, in, the, tertiary, squid, are, soft, bodied, molluscs, whose, forms, evolved, to, adopt, an, active, predatory, lifestyle, the, head, and, foot, of, the, squid, are, at, one, end, of, a, long, body, and, this, end, is, functionally, anterior, leading, the, animal, as, it, moves, through, the, water, a, set, of, eight, arms, and, two, distinctive, tentacles, surround, the, mouth, each, appendage, takes, the, form, of, a, muscular, hydrostat, and, is, flexible, and, prehensile, usually, bearing, disc, like, suckers, the, suckers, may, lie, directly, on, the, arm, or, be, stalked, their, rims, are, stiffened, with, chitin, and, may, contain, minute, toothlike, denticles, these, features, as, well, as, strong, musculature, and, a, small, ganglion, beneath, each, sucker, to, allow, individual, control, provide, a, very, powerful, adhesion, to, grip, prey, hooks, are, present, on, the, arms, and, tentacles, in, some, species, but, their, function, is, unclear, the, two, tentacles, are, much, longer, than, the, arms, and, are, retractile, suckers, are, limited, to, the, spatulate, tip, of, the, tentacle, known, as, the, manus, in, the, mature, male, the, outer, half, of, one, of, the, left, arms, is, hectocotylised, and, ends, in, a, copulatory, pad, rather, than, suckers, this, is, used, for, depositing, a, spermatophore, inside, the, mantle, cavity, of, a, female, a, ventral, part, of, the, foot, has, been, converted, into, a, funnel, through, which, water, exits, the, mantle, cavity, the, main, body, mass, is, enclosed, in, the, mantle, which, has, a, swimming, fin, along, each, side, these, fins, are, not, the, main, source, of, locomotion, in, most, species, the, mantle, wall, is, heavily, muscled, and, internal, the, visceral, mass, which, is, covered, by, a, thin, membranous, epidermis, forms, a, cone, shaped, posterior, region, known, as, the, visceral, hump, the, mollusc, shell, is, reduced, to, an, internal, longitudinal, chitinous, pen, in, the, functionally, dorsal, part, of, the, animal, the, pen, acts, to, stiffen, the, squid, and, provides, attachments, for, muscles, on, the, functionally, ventral, part, of, the, body, is, an, opening, to, the, mantle, cavity, which, contains, the, gills, ctenidia, and, openings, from, the, excretory, digestive, and, reproductive, systems, an, inhalant, siphon, behind, the, funnel, draws, water, into, the, mantle, cavity, via, a, valve, the, squid, uses, the, funnel, for, locomotion, via, precise, jet, propulsion, in, this, form, of, locomotion, water, is, sucked, into, the, mantle, cavity, and, expelled, out, of, the, funnel, in, a, fast, strong, jet, the, direction, of, travel, is, varied, by, the, orientation, of, the, funnel, squid, are, strong, swimmers, and, certain, species, can, fly, for, short, distances, out, of, the, water, squid, make, use, of, different, kinds, of, camouflage, namely, active, camouflage, for, background, matching, in, shallow, water, and, counter, illumination, this, helps, to, protect, them, from, their, predators, and, allows, them, to, approach, their, prey, the, skin, is, covered, in, controllable, chromatophores, of, different, colours, enabling, the, squid, to, match, its, coloration, to, its, surroundings, the, play, of, colours, may, in, addition, distract, prey, from, the, squid, s, approaching, tentacles, the, skin, also, contains, light, reflectors, called, iridophores, and, leucophores, that, when, activated, in, milliseconds, create, changeable, skin, patterns, of, polarized, light, such, skin, camouflage, may, serve, various, functions, such, as, communication, with, nearby, squid, prey, detection, navigation, and, orientation, during, hunting, or, seeking, shelter, neural, control, of, the, iridophores, enabling, rapid, changes, in, skin, iridescence, appears, to, be, regulated, by, a, cholinergic, process, affecting, reflectin, proteins, some, mesopelagic, squid, such, as, the, firefly, squid, watasenia, scintillans, and, the, midwater, squid, abralia, veranyi, use, counter, illumination, camouflage, generating, light, to, match, the, downwelling, light, from, the, ocean, surface, this, creates, the, effect, of, countershading, making, the, underside, lighter, than, the, upperside, counter, illumination, is, also, used, by, the, hawaiian, bobtail, squid, euprymna, scolopes, which, has, symbiotic, bacteria, aliivibrio, fischeri, that, produce, light, to, help, the, squid, avoid, nocturnal, predators, this, light, shines, through, the, squid, s, skin, on, its, underside, and, is, generated, by, a, large, and, complex, two, lobed, light, organ, inside, the, squid, s, mantle, cavity, from, there, it, escapes, downwards, some, of, it, travelling, directly, some, coming, off, a, reflector, at, the, top, of, the, organ, dorsal, side, below, there, is, a, kind, of, iris, which, has, branches, diverticula, of, its, ink, sac, with, a, lens, below, that, both, the, reflector, and, lens, are, derived, from, mesoderm, the, squid, controls, light, production, by, changing, the, shape, of, its, iris, or, adjusting, the, strength, of, yellow, filters, on, its, underside, which, presumably, change, the, balance, of, wavelengths, emitted, light, production, shows, a, correlation, with, intensity, of, down, welling, light, but, it, is, about, one, third, as, bright, the, squid, can, track, repeated, changes, in, brightness, because, the, hawaiian, bobtail, squid, hides, in, sand, during, the, day, to, avoid, predators, it, does, not, use, counter, illumination, during, daylight, hours, squid, distract, attacking, predators, by, ejecting, a, cloud, of, ink, giving, themselves, an, opportunity, to, escape, the, ink, gland, and, its, associated, ink, sac, empties, into, the, rectum, close, to, the, anus, allowing, the, squid, to, rapidly, discharge, black, ink, into, the, mantle, cavity, and, surrounding, water, the, ink, is, a, suspension, of, melanin, particles, and, quickly, disperses, to, form, a, dark, cloud, that, obscures, the, escape, manoeuvres, of, the, squid, predatory, fish, may, also, be, deterred, by, the, alkaloid, nature, of, the, discharge, which, may, interfere, with, their, chemoreceptors, cephalopods, have, the, most, highly, developed, nervous, systems, among, invertebrates, squids, have, a, complex, brain, in, the, form, of, a, nerve, ring, encircling, the, oesophagus, enclosed, in, a, cartilaginous, cranium, paired, cerebral, ganglia, above, the, oesophagus, receive, sensory, information, from, the, eyes, and, statocysts, and, further, ganglia, below, control, the, muscles, of, the, mouth, foot, mantle, and, viscera, giant, axons, up, to, 1, mm, 0, 04, in, in, diameter, convey, nerve, messages, with, great, rapidity, to, the, circular, muscles, of, the, mantle, wall, allowing, a, synchronous, powerful, contraction, and, maximum, speed, in, the, jet, propulsion, system, the, paired, eyes, on, either, side, of, the, head, are, housed, in, capsules, fused, to, the, cranium, their, structure, is, very, similar, to, that, of, a, fish, eye, with, a, globular, lens, that, has, a, depth, of, focus, from, 3, cm, 1, 2, in, to, infinity, the, image, is, focused, by, changing, the, position, of, the, lens, as, in, a, camera, or, telescope, rather, than, changing, the, shape, of, the, lens, as, in, the, human, eye, squid, adjust, to, changes, in, light, intensity, by, expanding, and, contracting, the, slit, shaped, pupil, deep, sea, squids, in, the, family, histioteuthidae, have, eyes, of, two, different, types, and, orientation, the, large, left, eye, is, tubular, in, shape, and, looks, upwards, presumably, searching, for, the, silhouettes, of, animals, higher, in, the, water, column, the, normally, shaped, right, eye, points, forwards, and, downwards, to, detect, prey, the, statocysts, are, involved, in, maintaining, balance, and, are, analogous, to, the, inner, ear, of, fish, they, are, housed, in, cartilaginous, capsules, on, either, side, of, the, cranium, they, provide, the, squid, with, information, on, its, body, position, in, relation, to, gravity, its, orientation, acceleration, and, rotation, and, are, able, to, perceive, incoming, vibrations, without, the, statocysts, the, squid, cannot, maintain, equilibrium, squid, appear, to, have, limited, hearing, but, the, head, and, arms, bear, lines, of, hair, cells, that, are, weakly, sensitive, to, water, movements, and, changes, in, pressure, and, are, analogous, in, function, to, the, lateral, line, system, of, fish, the, sexes, are, separate, in, squid, with, a, single, gonad, in, the, posterior, part, of, the, body, fertilisation, is, external, and, usually, takes, place, in, the, mantle, cavity, of, the, female, the, male, has, a, testis, from, which, sperm, pass, into, a, single, gonoduct, where, they, are, rolled, together, into, a, long, bundle, or, spermatophore, the, gonoduct, is, elongated, into, a, penis, that, extends, into, the, mantle, cavity, and, through, which, spermatophores, are, ejected, in, shallow, water, species, the, penis, is, short, and, the, spermatophore, is, removed, from, the, mantle, cavity, by, a, tentacle, of, the, male, which, is, specially, adapted, for, the, purpose, and, known, as, a, hectocotylus, and, placed, inside, the, mantle, cavity, of, the, female, during, mating, the, female, has, a, large, translucent, ovary, situated, towards, the, posterior, of, the, visceral, mass, from, here, eggs, travel, along, the, gonocoel, where, there, are, a, pair, of, white, nidamental, glands, which, lie, anterior, to, the, gills, also, present, are, red, spotted, accessory, nidamental, glands, containing, symbiotic, bacteria, both, organs, are, associated, with, nutrient, manufacture, and, forming, shells, for, the, eggs, the, gonocoel, enters, the, mantle, cavity, at, the, gonopore, and, in, some, species, receptacles, for, storing, spermatophores, are, located, nearby, in, the, mantle, wall, in, shallow, water, species, of, the, continental, shelf, and, epipelagic, or, mesopelagic, zones, it, is, frequently, one, or, both, of, arm, pair, iv, of, males, that, are, modified, into, hectocotyli, however, most, deep, sea, squid, lack, hectocotyl, arms, and, have, longer, penises, ancistrocheiridae, and, cranchiinae, are, exceptions, giant, squid, of, the, genus, architeuthis, are, unusual, in, that, they, possess, both, a, large, penis, and, modified, arm, tips, although, whether, the, latter, are, used, for, spermatophore, transfer, is, uncertain, penis, elongation, has, been, observed, in, the, deep, water, species, onykia, ingens, when, erect, the, penis, may, be, as, long, as, the, mantle, head, and, arms, combined, as, such, deep, water, squid, have, the, greatest, known, penis, length, relative, to, body, size, of, all, mobile, animals, second, in, the, entire, animal, kingdom, only, to, certain, sessile, barnacles, like, all, cephalopods, squids, are, predators, and, have, complex, digestive, systems, the, mouth, is, equipped, with, a, sharp, horny, beak, mainly, made, of, chitin, and, cross, linked, proteins, which, is, used, to, kill, and, tear, prey, into, manageable, pieces, the, beak, is, very, robust, but, does, not, contain, minerals, unlike, the, teeth, and, jaws, of, many, other, organisms, the, cross, linked, proteins, are, histidine, and, glycine, rich, and, give, the, beak, a, stiffness, and, hardness, greater, than, most, equivalent, synthetic, organic, materials, the, stomachs, of, captured, whales, often, have, indigestible, squid, beaks, inside, the, mouth, contains, the, radula, the, rough, tongue, common, to, all, molluscs, except, bivalvia, which, is, equipped, with, multiple, rows, of, teeth, in, some, species, toxic, saliva, helps, to, control, large, prey, when, subdued, the, food, can, be, torn, in, pieces, by, the, beak, moved, to, the, oesophagus, by, the, radula, and, swallowed, the, food, bolus, is, moved, along, the, gut, by, waves, of, muscular, contractions, peristalsis, the, long, oesophagus, leads, to, a, muscular, stomach, roughly, in, the, middle, of, the, visceral, mass, the, digestive, gland, which, is, equivalent, to, a, vertebrate, liver, diverticulates, here, as, does, the, pancreas, and, both, of, these, empty, into, the, caecum, a, pouch, shaped, sac, where, most, of, the, absorption, of, nutrients, takes, place, indigestible, food, can, be, passed, directly, from, the, stomach, to, the, rectum, where, it, joins, the, flow, from, the, caecum, and, is, voided, through, the, anus, into, the, mantle, cavity, cephalopods, are, short, lived, and, in, mature, squid, priority, is, given, to, reproduction, the, female, onychoteuthis, banksii, for, example, sheds, its, feeding, tentacles, on, reaching, maturity, and, becomes, flaccid, and, weak, after, spawning, the, squid, mantle, cavity, is, a, seawater, filled, sac, containing, three, hearts, and, other, organs, supporting, circulation, respiration, and, excretion, squid, have, a, main, systemic, heart, that, pumps, blood, around, the, body, as, part, of, the, general, circulatory, system, and, two, branchial, hearts, the, systemic, heart, consists, of, three, chambers, a, lower, ventricle, and, two, upper, atria, all, of, which, can, contract, to, propel, the, blood, the, branchial, hearts, pump, blood, specifically, to, the, gills, for, oxygenation, before, returning, it, to, the, systemic, heart, the, blood, contains, the, copper, rich, protein, hemocyanin, which, is, used, for, oxygen, transport, at, low, ocean, temperatures, and, low, oxygen, concentrations, and, makes, the, oxygenated, blood, a, deep, blue, color, as, systemic, blood, returns, via, two, vena, cavae, to, the, branchial, hearts, excretion, of, urine, carbon, dioxide, and, waste, solutes, occurs, through, outpockets, called, nephridial, appendages, in, the, vena, cavae, walls, that, enable, gas, exchange, and, excretion, via, the, mantle, cavity, seawater, unlike, nautiloids, and, cuttlefish, which, have, gas, filled, chambers, inside, their, shells, which, provide, buoyancy, and, octopuses, which, live, near, and, rest, on, the, seabed, and, do, not, require, to, be, buoyant, many, squid, have, a, fluid, filled, receptacle, equivalent, to, the, swim, bladder, of, a, fish, in, the, coelom, or, connective, tissue, this, reservoir, acts, as, a, chemical, buoyancy, chamber, with, the, heavy, metallic, cations, typical, of, seawater, replaced, by, low, molecular, weight, ammonium, ions, a, product, of, excretion, the, small, difference, in, density, provides, a, small, contribution, to, buoyancy, per, unit, volume, so, the, mechanism, requires, a, large, buoyancy, chamber, to, be, effective, since, the, chamber, is, filled, with, liquid, it, has, the, advantage, over, a, swim, bladder, of, not, changing, significantly, in, volume, with, pressure, glass, squids, in, the, family, cranchiidae, for, example, have, an, enormous, transparent, coelom, containing, ammonium, ions, and, occupying, about, two, thirds, the, volume, of, the, animal, allowing, it, to, float, at, the, required, depth, about, half, of, the, 28, families, of, squid, use, this, mechanism, to, solve, their, buoyancy, issues, the, family, bathyteuthidae, get, their, buoyancy, from, an, oily, substance, found, in, their, liver, and, around, their, mantle, and, head, the, majority, of, squid, are, no, more, than, 60, cm, 24, in, long, although, the, giant, squid, may, reach, 13, m, 43, ft, the, smallest, species, are, probably, the, benthic, pygmy, squids, idiosepius, which, grow, to, a, mantle, length, of, 10, to, 18, mm, 0, 4, to, 0, 7, in, and, have, short, bodies, and, stubby, arms, in, 1978, sharp, curved, claws, on, the, suction, cups, of, squid, tentacles, cut, up, the, rubber, coating, on, the, hull, of, the, uss, stein, the, size, suggested, the, largest, squid, known, at, the, time, in, 2003, a, large, specimen, of, an, abundant, but, poorly, understood, species, mesonychoteuthis, hamiltoni, the, colossal, squid, was, discovered, this, species, may, grow, to, 10, m, 33, ft, in, length, making, it, the, largest, invertebrate, in, february, 2007, a, new, zealand, fishing, vessel, caught, the, largest, squid, ever, documented, weighing, 495, kg, 1, 091, lb, and, measuring, around, 10, m, 33, ft, off, the, coast, of, antarctica, dissection, showed, that, the, eyes, used, to, detect, prey, in, the, deep, southern, ocean, exceeded, the, size, of, footballs, these, may, be, among, the, largest, eyes, ever, to, exist, in, the, animal, kingdom, the, eggs, of, squid, are, large, for, a, mollusc, containing, a, large, amount, of, yolk, to, nourish, the, embryo, as, it, develops, directly, without, an, intervening, veliger, larval, stage, the, embryo, grows, as, a, disc, of, cells, on, top, of, the, yolk, during, the, gastrulation, stage, the, margins, of, the, disc, grow, to, surround, the, yolk, forming, a, yolk, sac, which, eventually, forms, part, of, the, animal, s, gut, the, dorsal, side, of, the, disc, grows, upwards, and, forms, the, embryo, with, a, shell, gland, on, its, dorsal, surface, gills, mantle, and, eyes, the, arms, and, funnel, develop, as, part, of, the, foot, on, the, ventral, side, of, the, disc, the, arms, later, migrate, upwards, coming, to, form, a, ring, around, the, funnel, and, mouth, the, yolk, is, gradually, absorbed, as, the, embryo, grows, some, juvenile, squid, live, higher, in, the, water, column, than, do, adults, squids, tend, to, be, short, lived, loligo, for, example, lives, from, one, to, three, years, according, to, species, typically, dying, soon, after, spawning, in, a, well, studied, bioluminescent, species, the, hawaiian, bobtail, squid, a, special, light, organ, in, the, squid, s, mantle, is, rapidly, colonized, with, aliivibrio, fischeri, bacteria, within, hours, of, hatching, this, light, organ, colonization, requires, this, particular, bacterial, species, for, a, symbiotic, relationship, no, colonization, occurs, in, the, absence, of, a, fischeri, colonization, occurs, in, a, horizontal, manner, such, that, the, hosts, acquires, its, bacterial, partners, from, the, environment, the, symbiosis, is, obligate, for, the, squid, but, facultative, for, the, bacteria, once, the, bacteria, enter, the, squid, they, colonize, interior, epithelial, cells, in, the, light, organ, living, in, crypts, with, complex, microvilli, protrusions, the, bacteria, also, interact, with, hemocytes, macrophage, like, blood, cells, that, migrate, between, epithelial, cells, but, the, mechanism, and, function, of, this, process, is, not, well, understood, bioluminescence, reaches, its, highest, levels, during, the, early, evening, hours, and, bottoms, out, before, dawn, this, occurs, because, at, the, end, of, each, day, the, contents, of, the, squid, s, crypts, are, expelled, into, the, surrounding, environment, approximately, 95, of, the, bacteria, are, voided, each, morning, before, the, bacterial, population, builds, up, again, by, nightfall, squid, can, move, about, in, several, different, ways, slow, movement, is, achieved, by, a, gentle, undulation, of, the, muscular, lateral, fins, on, either, side, of, the, trunk, which, drives, the, animal, forward, a, more, common, means, of, locomotion, providing, sustained, movement, is, achieved, using, jetting, during, which, contraction, of, the, muscular, wall, of, the, mantle, cavity, provides, jet, propulsion, slow, jetting, is, used, for, ordinary, locomotion, and, ventilation, of, the, gills, is, achieved, at, the, same, time, the, circular, muscles, in, the, mantle, wall, contract, this, causes, the, inhalant, valve, to, close, the, exhalant, valve, to, open, and, the, mantle, edge, to, lock, tightly, around, the, head, water, is, forced, out, through, the, funnel, which, is, pointed, in, the, opposite, direction, to, the, required, direction, of, travel, the, inhalant, phase, is, initiated, by, the, relaxation, of, the, circular, muscles, causes, them, to, stretch, the, connective, tissue, in, the, mantle, wall, recoils, elastically, the, mantle, cavity, expands, causing, the, inhalant, valve, to, open, the, exhalant, valve, to, close, and, water, to, flow, into, the, cavity, this, cycle, of, exhalation, and, inhalation, is, repeated, to, provide, continuous, locomotion, fast, jetting, is, an, escape, response, in, this, form, of, locomotion, radial, muscles, in, the, mantle, wall, are, involved, as, well, as, circular, ones, making, it, possible, to, hyper, inflate, the, mantle, cavity, with, a, larger, volume, of, water, than, during, slow, jetting, on, contraction, water, flows, out, with, great, force, the, funnel, always, being, pointed, anteriorly, and, travel, is, backwards, during, this, means, of, locomotion, some, squid, exit, the, water, in, a, similar, way, to, flying, fish, gliding, through, the, air, for, up, to, 50, m, 160, ft, and, occasionally, ending, up, on, the, decks, of, ships, squid, are, carnivores, and, with, their, strong, arms, and, suckers, can, overwhelm, relatively, large, animals, efficiently, prey, is, identified, by, sight, or, by, touch, grabbed, by, the, tentacles, which, can, be, shot, out, with, great, rapidity, brought, back, to, within, reach, of, the, arms, and, held, by, the, hooks, and, suckers, on, their, surface, in, some, species, the, squid, s, saliva, contains, toxins, which, act, to, subdue, the, prey, these, are, injected, into, its, bloodstream, when, the, prey, is, bitten, along, with, vasodilators, and, chemicals, to, stimulate, the, heart, and, quickly, circulate, to, all, parts, of, its, body, the, deep, sea, squid, taningia, danae, has, been, filmed, releasing, blinding, flashes, of, light, from, large, photophores, on, its, arms, to, illuminate, and, disorientate, potential, prey, although, squid, can, catch, large, prey, the, mouth, is, relatively, small, and, the, food, must, be, cut, into, pieces, by, the, chitinous, beak, with, its, powerful, muscles, before, being, swallowed, the, radula, is, located, in, the, buccal, cavity, and, has, multiple, rows, of, tiny, teeth, that, draw, the, food, backwards, and, grind, it, in, pieces, the, deep, sea, squid, mastigoteuthis, has, the, whole, length, of, its, whip, like, tentacles, covered, with, tiny, suckers, it, probably, catches, small, organisms, in, the, same, way, that, flypaper, traps, flies, the, tentacles, of, some, bathypelagic, squids, bear, photophores, which, may, bring, food, within, its, reach, by, attracting, prey, squid, are, among, the, most, intelligent, invertebrates, for, example, groups, of, humboldt, squid, hunt, cooperatively, spiralling, up, through, the, water, at, night, and, coordinating, their, vertical, and, horizontal, movements, while, foraging, courtship, in, squid, takes, place, in, the, open, water, and, involves, the, male, selecting, a, female, the, female, responding, and, the, transfer, by, the, male, of, spermatophores, to, the, female, in, many, instances, the, male, may, display, to, identify, himself, to, the, female, and, drive, off, any, potential, competitors, elaborate, changes, in, body, patterning, take, place, in, some, species, in, both, agonistic, and, courtship, behaviour, the, caribbean, reef, squid, sepioteuthis, sepioidea, for, example, employs, a, complex, array, of, colour, changes, during, courtship, and, social, interactions, and, has, a, range, of, about, 16, body, patterns, in, its, repertoire, the, pair, adopt, a, head, to, head, position, and, jaw, locking, may, take, place, in, a, similar, manner, to, that, adopted, by, some, cichlid, fish, the, heterodactylus, of, the, male, is, used, to, transfer, the, spermatophore, and, deposit, it, in, the, female, s, mantle, cavity, in, the, position, appropriate, for, the, species, this, may, be, adjacent, to, the, gonopore, or, in, a, seminal, receptacle, the, sperm, may, be, used, immediately, or, may, be, stored, as, the, eggs, pass, down, the, oviduct, they, are, wrapped, in, a, gelatinous, coating, before, continuing, to, the, mantle, cavity, where, they, are, fertilised, in, loligo, further, coatings, are, added, by, the, nidimental, glands, in, the, walls, of, the, cavity, and, the, eggs, leave, through, a, funnel, formed, by, the, arms, the, female, attaches, them, to, the, substrate, in, strings, or, groups, the, coating, layers, swelling, and, hardening, after, contact, with, sea, water, loligo, sometimes, forms, breeding, aggregations, which, may, create, a, community, pile, of, egg, strings, some, pelagic, and, deep, sea, squid, do, not, attach, their, egg, masses, which, float, freely, squid, mostly, have, an, annual, life, cycle, growing, fast, and, dying, soon, after, spawning, the, diet, changes, as, they, grow, but, mostly, consists, of, large, zooplankton, and, small, nekton, in, antarctica, for, example, krill, is, the, main, constituent, of, the, diet, with, other, food, items, being, amphipods, other, small, crustaceans, and, large, arrow, worms, fish, are, also, eaten, and, some, squid, are, cannibalistic, as, well, as, occupying, a, key, role, in, the, food, chain, squid, are, an, important, prey, for, predators, including, sharks, sea, birds, seals, and, whales, juvenile, squid, provide, part, of, the, diet, for, worms, and, small, fish, when, researchers, studied, the, contents, of, the, stomachs, of, elephant, seals, in, south, georgia, they, found, 96, squid, by, weight, in, a, single, day, a, sperm, whale, can, eat, 700, to, 800, squid, and, a, risso, s, dolphin, entangled, in, a, net, in, the, mediterranean, was, found, to, have, eaten, angel, clubhook, squid, umbrella, squid, reverse, jewel, squid, and, european, flying, squid, all, identifiable, from, their, indigestible, beaks, ornithoteuthis, volatilis, a, common, squid, from, the, tropical, indo, pacific, is, predated, by, yellowfin, tuna, longnose, lancetfish, common, dolphinfish, and, swordfish, the, tiger, shark, the, scalloped, hammerhead, shark, and, the, smooth, hammerhead, shark, sperm, whales, also, hunt, this, species, extensively, as, does, the, brown, fur, seal, in, the, southern, ocean, penguins, and, wandering, albatrosses, are, major, predators, of, gonatus, antarcticus, giant, squid, have, featured, as, monsters, of, the, deep, since, classical, times, giant, squid, were, described, by, aristotle, 4th, century, bc, in, his, history, of, animals, and, pliny, the, elder, 1st, century, ad, in, his, natural, history, the, gorgon, of, greek, mythology, may, have, been, inspired, by, squid, or, octopus, the, animal, itself, representing, the, severed, head, of, medusa, the, beak, as, the, protruding, tongue, and, fangs, and, its, tentacles, as, the, snakes, the, six, headed, sea, monster, of, the, odyssey, scylla, may, have, had, a, similar, origin, the, nordic, legend, of, the, kraken, may, also, have, derived, from, sightings, of, large, cephalopods, in, literature, h, g, wells, short, story, the, sea, raiders, featured, a, man, eating, squid, species, haploteuthis, ferox, the, science, fiction, writer, jules, verne, told, a, tale, of, a, kraken, like, monster, in, his, 1870, novel, twenty, thousand, leagues, under, the, seas, squid, form, a, major, food, resource, and, are, used, in, cuisines, around, the, world, notably, in, japan, where, it, is, eaten, as, ika, s, men, sliced, into, vermicelli, like, strips, as, sashimi, and, as, tempura, three, species, of, loligo, are, used, in, large, quantities, l, vulgaris, in, the, mediterranean, known, as, calamar, in, spanish, calamaro, in, italian, l, forbesii, in, the, northeast, atlantic, and, l, pealei, on, the, american, east, coast, among, the, ommastrephidae, todarodes, pacificus, is, the, main, commercial, species, harvested, in, large, quantities, across, the, north, pacific, in, canada, japan, and, china, in, english, speaking, countries, squid, as, food, is, often, called, calamari, adopted, from, italian, into, english, in, the, 17th, century, squid, are, found, abundantly, in, certain, areas, and, provide, large, catches, for, fisheries, the, body, can, be, stuffed, whole, cut, into, flat, pieces, or, sliced, into, rings, the, arms, tentacles, and, ink, are, also, edible, the, only, parts, not, eaten, are, the, beak, and, gladius, pen, squid, is, a, good, food, source, for, zinc, and, manganese, and, high, in, copper, selenium, vitamin, b, 12, and, riboflavin, according, to, the, fao, the, cephalopod, catch, for, 2002, was, 3, 173, 272, tonnes, 6, 995867, 10, 9, lb, of, this, 2, 189, 206, tonnes, or, 75, 8, percent, was, squid, the, following, table, lists, squid, species, fishery, catches, that, exceeded, 10, 000, tonnes, 22, 000, 000, lb, in, 2002, prototype, chromatophores, that, mimic, the, squid, s, adaptive, camouflage, have, been, made, by, bristol, university, researchers, using, an, electroactive, dielectric, elastomer, a, flexible, smart, material, that, changes, its, colour, and, texture, in, response, to, electrical, signals, the, researchers, state, that, their, goal, is, to, create, an, artificial, skin, that, provides, rapid, active, camouflage, the, squid, giant, axon, inspired, otto, schmitt, to, develop, a, comparator, circuit, with, hysteresis, now, called, the, schmitt, trigger, replicating, the, axon, s, propagation, of, nerve, impulses
