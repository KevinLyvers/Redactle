oarfish, are, large, greatly, elongated, pelagic, lampriform, fish, belonging, to, the, small, family, regalecidae, found, in, areas, spanning, from, temperate, ocean, zones, to, tropical, ones, yet, rarely, seen, the, oarfish, family, contains, three, species, in, two, genera, one, of, these, the, giant, oarfish, regalecus, glesne, is, the, longest, bony, fish, alive, growing, up, to, about, 8, m, 26, ft, in, length, the, common, name, oarfish, is, thought, to, be, in, reference, either, to, their, highly, compressed, and, elongated, bodies, or, to, the, now, discredited, belief, that, the, fish, row, themselves, through, the, water, with, their, pelvic, fins, the, family, name, regalecidae, is, derived, from, the, latin, regalis, meaning, royal, their, rarity, and, large, size, along, with, occasional, beachings, of, oarfish, after, storms, and, their, habit, of, lingering, at, the, surface, when, sick, or, dying, make, oarfish, a, probable, source, of, many, sea, serpent, tales, although, the, larger, species, are, considered, game, fish, and, are, fished, commercially, to, a, minor, extent, oarfish, are, rarely, caught, alive, their, flesh, is, not, well, regarded, for, eating, due, to, its, gelatinous, consistency, the, dorsal, fin, originates, from, above, the, relatively, large, eyes, and, runs, the, entire, length, of, the, fish, of, the, approximately, 400, dorsal, fin, rays, the, first, 10, to, 13, are, elongated, to, varying, degrees, forming, a, trailing, crest, embellished, with, reddish, spots, and, flaps, of, skin, at, the, ray, tips, the, pelvic, fins, are, similarly, elongated, and, adorned, reduced, to, one, to, five, rays, each, the, pectoral, fins, are, greatly, reduced, and, situated, low, on, the, body, the, anal, fin, is, completely, absent, and, the, caudal, fin, may, be, reduced, or, absent, as, well, with, the, body, tapering, to, a, fine, point, all, fins, lack, true, spines, at, least, one, account, from, researchers, in, new, zealand, described, the, oarfish, as, giving, off, electric, shocks, when, touched, like, other, members, of, its, order, the, oarfish, has, a, small, yet, highly, protrusible, oblique, mouth, with, no, visible, teeth, the, body, is, scaleless, and, the, skin, is, covered, with, easily, abraded, silvery, ganoine, in, the, streamer, fish, agrostichthys, parkeri, the, skin, is, clad, with, hard, tubercles, all, species, lack, gas, bladders, and, the, number, of, gill, rakers, is, variable, oarfish, coloration, is, also, variable, the, flanks, are, commonly, covered, with, irregular, bluish, to, blackish, streaks, black, dots, and, squiggles, these, markings, quickly, fade, following, death, it, is, probable, that, these, markings, are, bioluminescent, in, the, deep, sea, the, giant, oarfish, is, by, far, the, largest, member, of, the, family, at, a, published, total, length, of, 8, m, 26, ft, with, unconfirmed, reports, of, 11, m, 36, ft, and, 17, m, 56, ft, specimens, and, 270, kg, 600, lb, in, weight, the, streamer, fish, is, known, to, reach, 3, m, 10, ft, in, length, while, the, largest, recorded, specimen, of, regalecus, russelii, measured, 5, 4, m, 18, ft, in, some, oarfishes, found, end, of, tails, may, appear, stump, like, this, is, likely, the, consequence, of, self, amputation, that, is, thought, to, be, a, defense, mechanism, against, predators, hyperostotic, bone, growth, has, been, documented, in, several, specimen, of, oarfish, that, have, washed, up, on, the, coast, of, california, hyperossified, pterygiophores, have, been, discovered, to, run, along, the, entire, dorsal, length, of, oarfish, the, function, of, this, is, to, both, provide, structural, support, to, the, spine, of, oarfish, during, undulations, tail, movement, used, for, locomotion, and, to, remodel, spines, to, prevent, stress, fractures, that, could, occur, from, too, much, movement, it, has, also, been, hypothesized, that, this, hyper, ossification, acts, as, a, lever, for, the, oarfish, dorsal, fins, which, contributes, to, the, organism, s, buoyancy, unlike, many, deep, sea, fish, oarfish, have, no, swim, bladders, for, maintaining, depth, in, the, water, column, it, is, likely, that, this, lack, of, a, swim, bladder, forces, more, frequent, tail, undulations, as, the, main, mode, of, depth, regulation, in, oarfish, through, the, analysis, of, the, mitochondrial, genome, of, regalecus, glesne, the, phylogenetic, placement, of, the, giant, oarfish, was, further, verified, oarfish, are, considered, lampriformes, a, phylogenetic, order, and, they, have, been, placed, here, due, to, their, morphology, however, analysis, of, the, mitochondrial, genome, of, an, r, glesne, specimen, clusters, the, species, with, trachipterus, trachypterus, and, zu, cristatus, two, other, lampriformes, these, three, species, were, clustered, together, due, to, similarity, in, genetic, sequence, and, morphology, which, further, supports, the, phylogeny, and, evolution, of, lampriformes, the, oarfish, is, thought, to, inhabit, the, epipelagic, to, mesopelagic, ocean, layers, ranging, from, 250, meters, 660, ft, to, 1, 000, meters, 3, 300, ft, and, is, rarely, seen, on, the, surface, a, few, have, been, found, still, barely, alive, but, usually, if, one, floats, to, the, surface, it, dies, due, to, depressurisation, at, the, depths, the, oarfish, live, there, are, few, or, no, currents, as, a, result, they, build, little, muscle, mass, and, they, cannot, survive, in, shallower, turbulent, water, the, members, of, the, family, are, known, to, have, a, worldwide, range, they, have, wide, tropical, subtropical, and, warm, temperate, distributions, the, oarfish, typically, reside, in, the, mesopelagic, area, of, the, sea, however, human, encounters, with, live, oarfish, are, rare, and, distribution, information, is, collated, from, records, of, oarfish, caught, or, washed, ashore, oarfish, were, first, described, in, 1772, rare, encounters, with, divers, and, accidental, catches, have, supplied, what, little, is, known, of, oarfish, ethology, behavior, and, ecology, oarfish, are, solitary, animals, and, may, frequent, significant, depths, up, to, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, an, oarfish, measuring, 3, 3, m, 11, ft, and, 63, 5, kg, 140, lb, was, reported, to, have, been, caught, in, february, 2003, using, a, fishing, rod, baited, with, squid, at, skinningrove, united, kingdom, in, 2001, an, oarfish, was, filmed, alive, in, the, wild, the, 1, 5, metre, 4, 9, foot, fish, was, spotted, by, a, group, of, u, s, navy, personnel, during, the, inspection, of, a, buoy, in, the, bahamas, the, oarfish, was, observed, to, propel, itself, by, an, amiiform, mode, of, swimming, that, is, rhythmically, undulating, the, dorsal, fin, while, keeping, the, body, itself, straight, perhaps, indicating, a, feeding, posture, oarfish, have, been, observed, swimming, in, a, vertical, orientation, with, their, long, axis, perpendicular, to, the, ocean, surface, in, this, posture, the, downstreaming, light, would, silhouette, the, oarfishes, prey, making, them, easier, to, spot, in, july, 2008, scientists, captured, footage, of, an, oarfish, swimming, in, its, natural, habitat, in, the, mesopelagic, zone, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, it, is, the, first, ever, confirmed, sighting, of, an, oarfish, at, depth, as, most, specimens, are, discovered, dying, at, the, sea, surface, or, washed, ashore, the, fish, was, estimated, to, be, between, five, and, ten, metres, 16, and, 33, ft, in, length, as, part, of, the, serpent, project, five, observations, of, apparently, healthy, oarfish, regalecus, glesne, by, remotely, operated, vehicles, were, reported, from, the, northern, gulf, of, mexico, between, 2008, and, 2011, at, depths, within, the, epipelagic, and, mesopelagic, zones, these, observations, include, the, deepest, verified, record, of, r, glesne, 463, 492, m, or, 1, 519, 1, 614, ft, in, the, 2011, sighting, an, oarfish, has, been, observed, to, switch, from, swimming, with, a, vertical, posture, to, swimming, laterally, using, lateral, undulations, of, its, entire, body, oarfish, were, found, to, have, late, or, slow, flight, responses, towards, approaching, remotely, operated, vehicles, supporting, the, hypothesis, that, oarfish, have, few, natural, predators, from, december, 2009, to, march, 2010, unusual, numbers, of, the, slender, oarfish, regalecus, russelii, ry, g, no, tsukai, known, in, japanese, folklore, as, the, messenger, from, the, sea, god, s, palace, appeared, in, the, waters, and, on, the, beaches, of, japan, the, appearance, of, which, is, said, to, portend, earthquakes, after, the, 2011, t, hoku, earthquake, and, tsunami, which, killed, over, 20, 000, people, many, pointed, to, the, oarfish, from, 2009, 2010, to, build, up, this, myth, in, 2016, animal, planet, aired, an, episode, of, the, television, series, river, monsters, named, deep, sea, demon, in, which, jeremy, wade, was, filmed, during, an, encounter, with, a, live, oarfish, while, diving, the, oarfish, at, this, location, seemed, to, be, using, a, buoy, anchor, chain, as, a, guide, to, ascend, to, the, surface, on, his, second, diving, attempt, he, was, able, to, film, two, live, oarfish, as, they, ascended, relatively, close, to, the, surface, wade, was, even, able, to, touch, one, of, the, oarfish, with, his, hand, the, oarfish, were, propelling, themselves, by, an, amiiform, mode, of, swimming, as, noted, by, other, sightings, in, january, 2019, two, oarfish, were, found, alive, in, the, nets, of, fishermen, on, the, japanese, island, of, okinawa, the, fish, is, often, nicknamed, the, doomsday, fish, because, historically, appearances, of, the, fish, were, linked, with, subsequent, natural, disasters, namely, earthquakes, or, tsunamis, oarfish, feed, primarily, on, zooplankton, selectively, straining, tiny, euphausiids, shrimp, and, other, crustaceans, from, the, water, small, fish, jellyfish, and, squid, are, also, taken, large, open, ocean, carnivores, are, all, likely, predators, of, oarfish, it, has, been, observed, that, oarfish, eat, by, suctioning, prey, such, as, plankton, blooms, while, in, the, water, the, oceanodromous, regalecus, glesne, is, recorded, as, spawning, off, mexico, from, july, to, december, all, species, are, presumed, to, not, guard, their, eggs, and, release, brightly, coloured, buoyant, eggs, up, to, six, millimetres, 0, 24, in, across, which, are, incorporated, into, the, zooplankton, based, on, their, reproductive, morphology, oarfish, are, thought, to, batch, spawn, within, each, breeding, season, that, may, last, one, or, two, months, individuals, spawn, once, or, multiple, times, in, discrete, spawning, events, before, their, gonads, enter, a, long, regressive, stage, of, reproductive, development, the, eggs, hatch, after, about, three, weeks, into, highly, active, larvae, that, feed, on, other, zooplankton, the, larvae, have, little, resemblance, to, the, adults, with, long, dorsal, and, pelvic, fins, and, extensible, mouths, larvae, and, juveniles, have, been, observed, drifting, just, below, the, surface, in, contrast, adult, oarfish, are, rarely, seen, at, the, surface, when, not, sick, or, injured, it, is, probable, that, the, fishes, go, deeper, as, they, mature, from, january, to, february, 2019, researchers, tested, and, recorded, the, first, successful, instance, of, artificial, insemination, and, hatching, of, the, oarfish, regalecus, russellii, using, gonads, from, two, washed, up, specimens, compared, to, adults, the, body, structure, of, newly, hatched, oarfish, larvae, look, more, compressed, the, larvae, often, swam, using, mainly, their, pectoral, fins, facing, downward, with, their, mouths, constantly, open, the, larvae, were, invertebrates, but, had, bones, in, their, head, area, as, well, as, fins, they, died, of, starvation, four, days, after, they, hatched, in, addition, to, the, otolith, recent, studies, have, revealed, more, information, about, the, reproductive, organs, of, the, oarfish, using, photographs, histological, cross, sections, and, measurements, of, four, samples, of, r, russelii, researchers, were, able, to, qualitatively, describe, the, sexual, organs, of, the, species, these, studies, have, shown, that, female, oarfish, have, bifurcated, ovaries, containing, a, cavity, through, which, the, eggs, pass, before, leaving, the, body, of, the, oarfish, testes, on, male, oarfish, are, located, in, a, similar, place, as, the, ovaries, of, female, oarfish, near, the, digestive, tract, called, the, coelomic, cavity, the, oarfish, have, two, separate, disconnected, testes, and, the, left, testes, observed, were, longer, than, the, right, testes, an, analysis, of, these, findings, led, researchers, to, conclude, that, r, russelii, are, likely, batch, spawning, fish, that, produce, a, large, number, of, offspring, every, breeding, season, like, the, topic, of, behavior, and, hunting, scientists, know, very, little, about, the, actual, breeding, habits, of, these, fish, a, single, female, can, produce, hundreds, of, thousands, to, millions, of, eggs, it, lays, its, eggs, in, the, water, column, and, they, float, freely, in, the, water, a, recent, study, concerning, the, parasitization, of, this, species, revealed, that, the, shortfin, mako, shark, and, the, sperm, whale, could, both, be, predators, of, the, oarfish, based, on, patterns, of, parasite, transmission, these, conclusions, were, made, based, on, analysis, of, the, visceral, tissue, of, an, oarfish, recovered, by, the, catalina, island, marine, institute, in, santa, catalina, island, california
