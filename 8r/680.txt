21, see, text, the, swallows, martins, and, saw, wings, or, hirundinidae, are, a, family, of, passerine, songbirds, found, around, the, world, on, all, continents, including, occasionally, in, antarctica, highly, adapted, to, aerial, feeding, they, have, a, distinctive, appearance, the, term, swallow, is, used, as, the, common, name, for, hirundo, rustica, in, the, uk, and, ireland, around, 90, species, of, hirundinidae, are, known, divided, into, 21, genera, with, the, greatest, diversity, found, in, africa, which, is, also, thought, to, be, where, they, evolved, as, hole, nesters, they, also, occur, on, a, number, of, oceanic, islands, a, number, of, european, and, north, american, species, are, long, distance, migrants, by, contrast, the, west, and, south, african, swallows, are, nonmigratory, this, family, comprises, two, subfamilies, pseudochelidoninae, the, river, martins, of, the, genus, pseudochelidon, and, hirundininae, all, other, swallows, martins, and, saw, wings, in, the, old, world, the, name, martin, tends, to, be, used, for, the, squarer, tailed, species, and, the, name, swallow, for, the, more, fork, tailed, species, however, this, distinction, does, not, represent, a, real, evolutionary, separation, in, the, new, world, martin, is, reserved, for, members, of, the, genus, progne, these, two, systems, are, responsible, for, the, same, species, being, called, sand, martin, in, the, old, world, and, bank, swallow, in, the, new, world, the, family, hirundinidae, was, introduced, as, hirundia, by, the, french, polymath, constantine, samuel, rafinesque, in, 1815, the, hirundinidae, are, morphologically, unique, within, the, passerines, with, molecular, evidence, placing, them, as, a, distinctive, lineage, within, the, sylvioidea, old, world, warblers, and, relatives, phylogenetic, analysis, has, shown, that, the, family, hirundinidae, is, sister, to, the, cupwings, in, the, family, pnoepygidae, the, two, families, diverged, in, the, early, miocene, around, 22, million, years, ago, within, the, family, a, clear, division, exists, between, the, two, subfamilies, the, pseudochelidoninae, which, are, composed, of, the, two, species, of, river, martins, and, the, hirundininae, into, which, the, remaining, species, are, placed, the, division, of, the, hirundininae, has, been, the, source, of, much, discussion, with, various, taxonomists, variously, splitting, them, into, as, many, as, 24, genera, and, lumping, them, into, just, 12, some, agreement, exists, that, three, core, groups, occur, within, the, hirundininae, the, saw, wings, of, the, genus, psalidoprocne, the, core, martins, and, the, swallows, of, the, genus, hirundo, and, their, allies, the, saw, wings, are, the, most, basal, of, the, three, with, the, other, two, clades, being, sister, to, each, other, the, phylogeny, of, the, swallows, is, closely, related, to, evolution, of, nest, construction, the, more, basal, saw, wings, use, burrows, as, nest, the, core, martins, have, both, burrowing, in, the, old, world, members, and, cavity, adoption, in, new, world, members, as, strategies, and, the, genus, hirundo, and, its, allies, use, mud, nests, the, genus, level, cladogram, shown, below, is, based, on, a, molecular, phylogenetic, study, by, drew, schield, and, collaborators, that, was, published, in, 2024, the, choice, of, genera, and, the, number, of, species, is, taken, from, the, list, of, birds, maintained, by, frank, gill, pamela, c, rasmussen, and, david, donsker, on, behalf, of, the, international,

oldest, known, fossil, swallow, is, miochelidon, eschata, from, the, early, miocene, of, siberia, it, is, the, only, record, of, hirundinidae, from, the, miocene, it, is, likely, a, basal, member, of, the, family, the, hirundinidae, have, an, evolutionarily, conservative, body, shape, which, is, similar, across, the, clade, but, is, unlike, that, of, other, passerines, swallows, have, adapted, to, hunting, insects, on, the, wing, by, developing, a, slender, streamlined, body, and, long, pointed, wings, which, allow, great, maneuverability, and, endurance, as, well, as, frequent, periods, of, gliding, their, body, shapes, allow, for, very, efficient, flight, the, metabolic, rate, of, swallows, in, flight, is, 49, 72, lower, than, equivalent, passerines, of, the, same, size, swallows, have, two, foveae, in, each, eye, giving, them, sharp, lateral, and, frontal, vision, to, help, track, prey, they, also, have, relatively, long, eyes, with, their, length, almost, equaling, their, width, the, long, eyes, allow, for, an, increase, in, visual, acuity, without, competing, with, the, brain, for, space, inside, of, the, head, the, morphology, of, the, eye, in, swallows, is, similar, to, that, of, a, raptor, like, the, unrelated, swifts, and, nightjars, which, hunt, in, a, similar, way, they, have, short, bills, but, strong, jaws, and, a, wide, gape, their, body, lengths, range, from, about, 10, 24, cm, 3, 9, 9, 4, in, and, their, weight, from, about, 10, 60, g, 0, 35, 2, 12, oz, the, smallest, species, by, weight, may, be, the, fanti, sawwing, at, a, mean, body, mass, of, 9, 4, g, 0, 33, oz, while, the, purple, martin, and, southern, martin, which, both, weigh, in, excess, of, 50, g, 1, 8, oz, on, average, rival, one, another, as, the, heaviest, swallows, the, wings, are, long, pointed, and, have, nine, primary, feathers, the, tail, has, 12, feathers, and, may, be, deeply, forked, somewhat, indented, or, square, ended, a, long, tail, increases, maneuverability, and, may, also, function, as, a, sexual, adornment, since, the, tail, is, frequently, longer, in, males, in, barn, swallows, the, tail, of, the, male, is, 18, longer, than, those, of, the, female, and, females, select, mates, on, the, basis, of, tail, length, their, legs, are, short, and, their, feet, are, adapted, for, perching, rather, than, walking, as, the, front, toes, are, partially, joined, at, the, base, swallows, are, capable, of, walking, and, even, running, but, they, do, so, with, a, shuffling, waddling, gait, the, leg, muscles, of, the, river, martins, pseudochelidon, are, stronger, and, more, robust, than, those, of, other, swallows, the, river, martins, have, other, characteristics, that, separate, them, from, the, other, swallows, the, structure, of, the, syrinx, is, substantially, different, between, the, two, subfamilies, and, in, most, swallows, the, bill, legs, and, feet, are, dark, brown, or, black, but, in, the, river, martins, the, bill, is, orange, red, and, the, legs, and, feet, are, pink, the, most, common, hirundine, plumage, is, glossy, dark, blue, or, green, above, and, plain, or, streaked, underparts, often, white, or, rufous, species, that, burrow, or, live, in, dry, or, mountainous, areas, are, often, matte, brown, above, e, g, sand, martin, and, crag, martin, the, sexes, show, limited, or, no, sexual, dimorphism, with, longer, outer, tail, feathers, in, the, adult, male, probably, being, the, most, common, distinction, the, chicks, hatch, naked, and, with, closed, eyes, fledged, juveniles, usually, appear, as, duller, versions, of, the, adult, the, family, has, a, worldwide, cosmopolitan, distribution, breeding, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, one, species, the, pacific, swallow, occurs, as, a, breeding, bird, on, a, number, of, oceanic, islands, in, the, pacific, ocean, the, mascarene, martin, breeds, on, reunion, and, mauritius, in, the, indian, ocean, and, a, number, of, migratory, species, are, common, vagrants, to, other, isolated, islands, and, even, to, some, sub, antarctic, islands, and, antarctica, many, species, have, enormous, worldwide, ranges, particularly, the, barn, swallow, which, breeds, over, most, of, the, northern, hemisphere, and, winters, over, most, of, the, southern, hemisphere, the, family, uses, a, wide, range, of, habitats, they, are, dependent, on, flying, insects, and, as, these, are, common, over, waterways, and, lakes, they, frequently, feed, over, these, but, they, can, be, found, in, any, open, habitat, including, grasslands, open, woodland, savanna, marshes, mangroves, and, scrubland, from, sea, level, to, high, alpine, areas, many, species, inhabit, human, altered, landscapes, including, agricultural, land, and, even, urban, areas, land, use, changes, have, also, caused, some, species, to, expand, their, range, most, impressively, the, welcome, swallow, which, began, to, colonise, new, zealand, in, the, 1920s, started, breeding, in, the, 1950s, and, is, now, a, common, landbird, there, species, breeding, in, temperate, regions, migrate, during, the, winter, when, their, insect, prey, populations, collapse, species, breeding, in, more, tropical, areas, are, often, more, sedentary, although, several, tropical, species, are, partial, migrants, or, make, shorter, migrations, in, antiquity, swallows, were, thought, to, have, hibernated, in, a, state, of, torpor, or, even, that, they, withdrew, for, the, winter, under, water, aristotle, ascribed, hibernation, not, only, to, swallows, but, also, to, storks, and, kites, hibernation, of, swallows, was, considered, a, possibility, even, by, as, acute, an, observer, as, rev, gilbert, white, in, his, the, natural, history, and, antiquities, of, selborne, 1789, based, on, decades, of, observations, this, idea, may, have, been, supported, by, the, habit, of, some, species, to, roost, in, some, numbers, in, dovecotes, nests, and, other, forms, of, shelter, during, harsh, weather, and, some, species, even, entering, torpor, there, were, several, reports, of, suspected, torpor, in, swallows, from, 1947, such, as, a, 1970, report, that, white, backed, swallows, in, australia, may, conserve, energy, this, way, but, the, first, confirmed, study, that, they, or, any, passerine, entered, torpor, was, a, 1988, study, on, house, martins, swallows, are, excellent, flyers, and, use, these, skills, to, feed, and, attract, mates, some, species, such, as, the, mangrove, swallow, are, territorial, whereas, others, are, not, and, simply, defend, their, nesting, sites, in, general, the, male, selects, a, nest, site, and, then, attracts, a, female, using, song, and, flight, and, dependent, on, the, species, guards, his, territory, the, size, of, the, territory, varies, depending, on, the, species, of, swallow, in, colonial, nesting, species, it, tends, to, be, small, but, it, may, be, much, larger, for, solitary, nesters, outside, the, breeding, season, some, species, may, form, large, flocks, and, species, may, also, roost, communally, this, is, thought, to, provide, protection, from, predators, such, as, sparrowhawks, and, hobbies, these, roosts, can, be, enormous, one, winter, roosting, site, of, barn, swallows, in, nigeria, attracted, 1, 5, million, individuals, nonsocial, species, do, not, form, flocks, but, recently, fledged, chicks, may, remain, with, their, parents, for, a, while, after, the, breeding, season, if, a, human, being, gets, too, close, to, their, territory, swallows, attack, them, within, the, perimeter, of, the, nest, colonial, species, may, mob, predators, and, humans, that, are, too, close, to, the, colony, for, the, most, part, swallows, are, insectivorous, taking, flying, insects, on, the, wing, across, the, whole, family, a, wide, range, of, insects, is, taken, from, most, insect, groups, but, the, composition, of, any, one, prey, type, in, the, diet, varies, by, species, and, with, the, time, of, year, individual, species, may, be, selective, they, do, not, scoop, up, every, insect, around, them, but, instead, select, larger, prey, items, than, would, be, expected, by, random, sampling, in, addition, the, ease, of, capture, of, different, insect, types, affects, their, rate, of, predation, by, swallows, they, also, avoid, certain, prey, types, in, particular, stinging, insects, such, as, bees, and, wasps, are, generally, avoided, in, addition, to, insect, prey, a, number, of, species, occasionally, consume, fruits, and, other, plant, matter, species, in, africa, have, been, recorded, eating, the, seeds, of, acacia, trees, and, these, are, even, fed, to, the, young, of, the, greater, striped, swallow, the, swallows, generally, forage, for, prey, on, the, wing, but, they, on, occasion, snap, prey, off, branches, or, on, the, ground, the, flight, may, be, fast, and, involve, a, rapid, succession, of, turns, and, banks, when, actively, chasing, fast, moving, prey, less, agile, prey, may, be, caught, with, a, slower, more, leisurely, flight, that, includes, flying, in, circles, and, bursts, of, flapping, mixed, with, gliding, where, several, species, of, swallows, feed, together, they, separate, into, different, niches, based, on, height, off, the, ground, some, species, feeding, closer, to, the, ground, and, others, feeding, at, higher, levels, similar, separation, occurs, where, feeding, overlaps, with, swifts, niche, separation, may, also, occur, with, the, size, of, prey, chosen, the, more, primitive, species, nest, in, existing, cavities, for, example, in, an, old, woodpecker, nest, while, other, species, excavate, burrows, in, soft, substrate, such, as, sand, banks, swallows, in, the, genera, hirundo, ptyonoprogne, cecropis, petrochelidon, atronanus, and, delichon, build, mud, nests, close, to, overhead, shelter, in, locations, that, are, protected, from, both, the, weather, and, predators, the, mud, nesters, are, most, common, in, the, old, world, particularly, africa, whereas, cavity, nesters, are, more, common, in, the, new, world, mud, nesting, species, in, particular, are, limited, in, areas, of, high, humidity, which, causes, the, mud, nests, to, crumble, many, cave, bank, and, cliff, dwelling, species, of, swallows, nest, in, large, colonies, mud, nests, are, constructed, by, both, males, and, females, and, amongst, the, tunnel, diggers, the, excavation, duties, are, shared, as, well, in, historical, times, the, introduction, of, man, made, stone, structures, such, as, barns, and, bridges, together, with, forest, clearance, has, led, to, an, abundance, of, colony, sites, around, the, globe, significantly, increasing, the, breeding, ranges, of, some, species, birds, living, in, large, colonies, typically, have, to, contend, with, both, ectoparasites, and, conspecific, nest, parasitism, in, barn, swallows, old, mated, males, and, young, unmated, males, benefit, from, colonial, behaviour, whereas, females, and, mated, young, males, likely, benefit, more, from, nesting, by, themselves, pairs, of, mated, swallows, are, monogamous, and, pairs, of, nonmigratory, species, often, stay, near, their, breeding, area, all, year, though, the, nest, site, is, defended, most, vigorously, during, the, breeding, season, migratory, species, often, return, to, the, same, breeding, area, each, year, and, may, select, the, same, nest, site, if, they, were, previously, successful, in, that, location, first, year, breeders, generally, select, a, nesting, site, close, to, where, they, were, raised, the, breeding, of, temperate, species, is, seasonal, whereas, that, of, subtropical, or, tropical, species, can, either, be, continuous, throughout, the, year, or, seasonal, seasonal, species, in, the, subtropics, or, tropics, usually, time, their, breeding, to, coincide, with, the, peaks, in, insect, activity, which, is, usually, the, wet, season, but, some, species, such, as, the, white, bibbed, swallow, nest, in, the, dry, season, to, avoid, flooding, in, their, riverbank, nesting, habitat, all, swallows, defend, their, nests, from, egg, predators, although, solitary, species, are, more, aggressive, towards, predators, than, colonial, species, overall, the, contribution, of, male, swallows, towards, parental, care, is, the, highest, of, any, passerine, bird, the, eggs, of, swallows, tend, to, be, white, although, those, of, some, mud, nesters, are, speckled, the, typical, clutch, size, is, around, four, to, five, eggs, in, temperate, areas, and, two, to, three, eggs, in, the, tropics, the, incubation, duties, are, shared, in, some, species, and, in, others, the, eggs, are, incubated, solely, by, the, females, amongst, the, species, where, the, males, help, with, incubation, their, contribution, varies, amongst, species, with, some, species, such, as, the, cliff, swallow, sharing, the, duties, equally, and, the, female, doing, most, of, the, work, in, others, amongst, the, barn, swallows, the, male, of, the, american, subspecies, helps, to, a, small, extent, whereas, the, european, subspecies, does, not, even, in, species, where, the, male, does, not, incubate, the, eggs, he, may, sit, on, them, when, the, female, is, away, to, reduce, heat, loss, this, is, different, from, incubation, as, that, involves, warming, the, eggs, not, just, stopping, heat, loss, incubation, stints, last, for, 5, 15, minutes, and, are, followed, by, bursts, of, feeding, activity, from, laying, swallow, eggs, take, 10, 21, days, to, hatch, with, 14, 18, days, being, more, typical, the, chicks, of, swallows, hatch, naked, generally, with, only, a, few, tufts, of, down, the, eyes, are, closed, and, do, not, fully, open, for, up, to, 10, days, the, feathers, take, a, few, days, to, begin, to, sprout, and, the, chicks, are, brooded, by, the, parents, until, they, are, able, to, thermoregulate, on, the, whole, they, develop, slowly, compared, to, other, passerine, birds, the, parents, do, not, usually, feed, the, chicks, individual, insects, but, instead, feed, a, bolus, of, food, comprising, 10, 100, insects, regardless, of, whether, the, species, has, males, that, incubate, or, brood, the, chicks, the, males, of, all, hirundines, help, feed, the, chicks, when, the, young, fledge, is, difficult, to, determine, as, they, are, enticed, out, of, the, nest, after, three, weeks, by, parents, but, frequently, return, to, the, nest, afterwards, to, roost, swallows, are, able, to, produce, many, different, calls, or, songs, which, are, used, to, express, excitement, to, communicate, with, others, of, the, same, species, during, courtship, or, as, an, alarm, when, a, predator, is, in, the, area, the, songs, of, males, are, related, to, the, body, condition, of, the, bird, and, are, presumably, used, by, females, to, judge, the, physical, condition, and, suitability, for, mating, of, males, begging, calls, are, used, by, the, young, when, soliciting, food, from, their, parents, the, typical, song, of, swallows, is, a, simple, sometimes, musical, twittering, species, of, hirundine, that, are, threatened, with, extinction, are, generally, endangered, due, to, habitat, loss, this, is, presumed, to, be, the, reason, behind, the, decline, of, the, critically, endangered, white, eyed, river, martin, a, species, that, is, only, known, from, a, few, specimens, collected, in, thailand, the, species, presumably, breeds, in, riverbanks, a, much, diminished, habitat, in, southeast, asia, as, the, species, has, not, been, reliably, seen, since, 1980, it, may, already, be, extinct, two, insular, species, the, bahama, swallow, and, golden, swallow, have, declined, due, to, forest, loss, and, also, competition, with, introduced, species, such, as, starlings, and, sparrows, which, compete, with, these, swallows, for, nesting, sites, the, golden, swallow, formerly, bred, on, the, island, of, jamaica, but, was, last, seen, there, in, 1989, and, is, now, restricted, to, the, island, of, hispaniola, swallows, are, tolerated, by, humans, because, of, their, beneficial, role, as, insect, eaters, and, some, species, have, readily, adapted, to, nesting, in, and, around, human, habitation, the, barn, swallow, and, house, martin, now, rarely, use, natural, sites, the, purple, martin, is, also, actively, encouraged, by, people, to, nest, around, humans, and, elaborate, nest, boxes, are, erected, enough, artificial, nesting, sites, have, been, created, that, the, purple, martin, now, seldom, nests, in, natural, cavities, in, the, eastern, part, of, its, range, because, of, the, long, human, experience, with, these, conspicuous, species, many, myths, and, legends, have, arisen, as, a, consequence, particularly, relating, to, the, barn, swallow, roman, historian, pliny, the, elder, described, a, use, of, painted, swallows, to, deliver, a, report, of, the, winning, horses, at, a, race, there, is, also, the, korean, folktale, of, heungbu, and, nolbu, which, teaches, a, moral, lesson, about, greed, and, altruism, through, the, mending, of, a, swallow, s, broken, leg, during, the, 19th, century, jean, desbouvrie, attempted, to, tame, swallows, and, train, them, for, use, as, messenger, birds, as, an, alternative, to, war, pigeons, the, swallows, would, have, a, light, load, of, course, as, a, laden, swallow, could, only, travel, about, half, as, far, as, an, unladen, swallow, in, the, same, trip, he, succeeded, in, curbing, the, migratory, instinct, in, young, birds, and, persuaded, the, government, of, france, to, conduct, initial, testing, but, further, experimentation, stalled, subsequent, attempts, to, train, homing, behaviour, into, swallows, and, other, passerines, had, difficulty, establishing, a, statistically, significant, success, rate, although, the, birds, have, been, known, to, trap, themselves, in, a, cage, repeatedly, to, get, to, the, bait, according, to, a, sailing, superstition, swallows, are, a, good, omen, to, those, at, sea, this, probably, arose, from, the, fact, that, swallows, are, land, based, birds, so, their, appearance, informs, a, sailor, that, he, or, she, is, close, to, shore, an, old, term, of, venery, for, swallows, is, a, flight, or, sweep, the, family, contains, 90, species, in, 21, genera
