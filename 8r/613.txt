https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretarybird
the, secretarybird, or, secretary, bird, sagittarius, serpentarius, is, a, large, bird, of, prey, that, is, endemic, to, africa, it, is, mostly, terrestrial, spending, most, of, its, time, on, the, ground, and, is, usually, found, in, the, open, grasslands, and, savanna, of, the, sub, saharan, region, john, frederick, miller, described, the, species, in, 1779, a, member, of, the, order, accipitriformes, which, also, includes, many, other, diurnal, birds, of, prey, such, as, eagles, hawks, kites, vultures, and, harriers, it, is, placed, in, its, own, family, sagittariidae, the, secretarybird, is, instantly, recognizable, as, a, very, large, bird, with, an, eagle, like, body, on, crane, like, legs, that, give, the, bird, a, height, of, as, much, as, 1, 3, m, 4, ft, 3, in, the, sexes, are, similar, in, appearance, adults, have, a, featherless, red, orange, face, and, predominantly, grey, plumage, with, a, flattened, dark, crest, and, black, flight, feathers, and, thighs, breeding, can, take, place, at, any, time, of, year, but, tends, to, be, late, in, the, dry, season, the, nest, is, built, at, the, top, of, a, thorny, tree, and, a, clutch, of, one, to, three, eggs, is, laid, in, years, with, plentiful, food, all, three, young, can, survive, to, fledging, the, secretarybird, hunts, and, catches, prey, on, the, ground, often, stomping, on, victims, to, kill, them, insects, and, small, vertebrates, make, up, its, diet, although, the, secretarybird, resides, over, a, large, range, the, results, of, localised, surveys, suggest, that, the, total, population, is, experiencing, a, rapid, decline, probably, as, a, result, of, habitat, destruction, the, species, is, therefore, classed, as, endangered, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, the, secretarybird, appears, on, the, coats, of, arms, of, sudan, and, south, africa, cathartidae, new, world, vultures, 7, species, sagittariidae, secretarybird, accipitridae, kites, hawks, and, eagles, 256, species, pandionidae, osprey, the, dutch, naturalist, arnout, vosmaer, described, the, secretarybird, in, 1769, on, the, basis, of, a, live, specimen, that, had, been, sent, to, holland, from, the, cape, of, good, hope, two, years, earlier, by, an, official, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, vosmaer, suggested, that, the, species, was, called, sagittarius, by, the, dutch, settlers, because, its, gait, was, thought, to, resemble, an, archer, s, he, also, mentioned, that, it, was, known, as, the, secretarius, by, farmers, who, had, domesticated, the, bird, to, combat, pests, around, their, homesteads, and, proposed, that, the, word, secretarius, might, be, a, corruption, of, sagittarius, ian, glenn, of, the, university, of, the, free, state, suggests, that, vosmaer, s, sagittarius, is, a, misheard, or, mis, transcribed, form, of, secretarius, rather, than, the, other, way, around, in, 1779, the, english, illustrator, john, frederick, miller, included, a, coloured, plate, of, the, secretarybird, in, his, icones, animalium, et, plantarum, and, coined, the, binomial, name, falco, serpentarius, as, the, oldest, published, specific, name, serpentarius, has, priority, over, later, scientific, names, the, species, was, assigned, to, its, own, genus, sagittarius, in, 1783, by, the, french, naturalist, johann, hermann, in, his, tabula, affinitatum, animalium, the, generic, name, sagittarius, is, latin, for, archer, and, the, specific, epithet, serpentarius, is, from, latin, serpens, meaning, serpent, or, snake, a, second, edition, of, miller, s, plates, was, published, in, 1796, as, cimelia, physica, with, added, text, by, english, naturalist, george, shaw, who, named, it, vultur, serpentarius, the, french, naturalist, georges, cuvier, erected, the, genus, serpentarius, in, 1798, and, the, german, naturalist, johann, karl, wilhelm, illiger, erected, the, now, synonymous, genus, gypogeranus, from, the, ancient, greek, words, gyps, vulture, and, geranos, crane, in, 1811, in, 1835, the, irish, naturalist, william, ogilby, spoke, at, a, meeting, of, the, zoological, society, of, london, and, proposed, three, species, of, secretarybird, distinguishing, those, from, senegambia, as, having, broader, crest, feathers, than, those, from, south, africa, and, reporting, a, distinct, species, from, the, philippines, based, on, the, writings, of, pierre, sonnerat, in, his, voyage, la, nouvelle, guin, e, there, is, no, other, evidence, this, taxon, existed, despite, its, large, range, the, secretarybird, is, considered, monotypic, no, subspecies, are, recognised, the, evolutionary, relationship, of, the, secretarybird, to, other, raptors, had, long, puzzled, ornithologists, the, species, was, usually, placed, in, its, own, family, sagittariidae, within, the, order, falconiformes, a, large, molecular, phylogenetic, study, published, in, 2008, concluded, that, the, secretarybird, was, sister, to, a, clade, containing, the, ospreys, in, the, family, pandionidae, and, the, kites, hawks, and, eagles, in, the, family, accipitridae, the, same, study, found, that, the, falcons, in, the, order, falconiformes, were, only, distantly, related, to, the, other, diurnal, birds, of, prey, the, families, cathartidae, sagittariidae, pandionidae, and, accipitridae, were, therefore, moved, from, falconiformes, to, the, resurrected, accipitriformes, a, later, molecular, phylogenetic, study, published, in, 2015, confirmed, these, relationships, the, earliest, fossils, associated, with, the, family, are, two, species, from, the, genus, pelargopappus, the, two, species, from, the, oligocene, and, miocene, respectively, were, discovered, in, france, the, feet, in, these, fossils, are, more, like, those, of, the, accipitridae, it, is, suggested, that, these, characteristics, are, primitive, features, within, the, family, in, spite, of, their, age, the, two, species, are, not, thought, to, be, ancestral, to, the, secretarybird, though, strongly, convergent, with, the, modern, secretarybird, the, extinct, raptor, apatosagittarius, is, thought, to, be, an, accipitrid, the, international, ornithologists, union, has, designated, secretarybird, the, official, common, name, for, the, species, in, 1780, the, french, polymath, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, suggested, that, the, name, secretary, secr, taire, had, been, chosen, because, of, the, long, quill, like, feathers, at, the, top, of, the, bird, s, neck, reminiscent, of, a, quill, pen, behind, the, ear, of, an, ancient, scribe, in, 1977, c, hilary, fry, of, aberdeen, university, suggested, that, secretary, is, from, the, french, secr, taire, a, corruption, of, the, arabic, saqr, et, tair, meaning, either, hawk, of, the, semi, desert, or, hawk, that, flies, glenn, has, dismissed, this, etymology, on, the, grounds, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, name, came, through, french, instead, supporting, buffon, s, etymology, namely, that, the, word, comes, from, the, dutch, secretaris, secretary, used, by, settlers, in, south, africa, the, secretarybird, is, instantly, recognisable, as, a, very, large, terrestrial, bird, with, an, eagle, like, head, and, body, on, crane, like, legs, it, stands, about, 1, 3, m, 4, ft, 3, in, tall, it, has, a, length, of, between, 1, 1, and, 1, 5, m, 3, ft, 7, in, and, 4, ft, 11, in, and, a, wingspan, of, between, 1, 9, and, 2, 1, m, 6, ft, 3, in, and, 6, ft, 11, in, the, weight, ranges, from, 3, 74, to, 4, 27, kg, 8, 2, to, 9, 4, lb, with, a, mean, of, 4, 05, kg, 8, 9, lb, the, tarsus, averages, 31, cm, 12, in, and, the, tail, is, 57, 85, cm, 22, 33, in, both, factor, into, making, it, both, taller, and, longer, than, any, other, species, of, raptor, the, neck, is, not, especially, long, and, can, only, be, lowered, down, to, the, intertarsal, joint, so, birds, must, stoop, to, reach, down, to, the, ground, during, flight, two, elongated, central, feathers, of, the, tail, extend, beyond, the, feet, and, the, neck, stretches, out, like, a, stork, the, plumage, of, the, crown, upperparts, and, lesser, and, median, wing, coverts, is, blue, grey, and, the, underparts, and, underwing, coverts, are, lighter, grey, to, grey, white, the, crest, is, made, up, of, long, black, feathers, arising, from, the, nape, the, scapulars, primary, and, secondary, flight, feathers, rump, and, thighs, are, black, while, the, uppertail, coverts, are, white, though, barred, with, black, in, some, individuals, the, tail, is, wedge, shaped, with, white, tipping, marbled, grey, and, black, colouring, at, the, base, and, two, broad, black, bands, one, at, the, base, and, the, other, at, the, end, sexes, resemble, one, another, although, the, male, tends, to, have, longer, tail, feathers, more, head, plumes, a, shorter, head, and, more, blue, grey, plumage, adults, have, a, featherless, red, orange, face, with, pale, brown, irises, and, a, yellow, cere, the, legs, and, feet, are, pinkish, grey, the, upper, legs, clad, in, black, feathers, the, toes, are, short, around, 20, of, the, length, of, those, of, an, eagle, of, the, same, size, and, stout, so, that, the, bird, is, unable, to, grasp, objects, with, its, feet, the, rear, toe, is, small, and, the, three, forward, facing, toes, are, connected, at, the, base, by, a, small, web, immature, birds, have, yellow, rather, than, orange, bare, skin, on, their, faces, more, brownish, plumage, shorter, tail, feathers, and, greyish, rather, than, brown, irises, adults, are, normally, silent, but, can, utter, a, deep, guttural, croaking, noise, in, nuptial, displays, or, at, nests, secretarybirds, make, this, sound, when, greeting, their, mates, or, in, a, threat, display, or, fight, against, other, birds, sometimes, throwing, their, head, backwards, at, the, same, time, when, alarmed, the, secretarybird, may, emit, a, high, pitched, croak, mated, pairs, at, the, nest, make, soft, clucking, or, whistling, calls, chicks, make, a, sharp, sound, heard, as, chee, uk, chee, uk, chee, uk, for, their, first, 30, days, the, secretarybird, is, endemic, to, sub, saharan, africa, and, is, generally, non, migratory, though, it, may, be, locally, nomadic, as, it, follows, rainfall, and, the, resulting, abundance, of, prey, its, range, extends, from, senegal, to, somalia, and, south, to, western, cape, south, africa, the, species, is, also, found, at, a, variety, of, elevations, from, the, coastal, plains, to, the, highlands, the, secretarybird, prefers, open, grasslands, savannas, and, shrubland, karoo, rather, than, forests, and, dense, shrubbery, that, may, impede, its, cursorial, existence, more, specifically, it, prefers, areas, with, grass, under, 0, 5, m, 1, ft, 8, in, high, and, avoids, those, with, grass, over, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, high, it, is, rarer, in, grasslands, in, northern, parts, of, its, range, that, otherwise, appear, similar, to, areas, in, southern, africa, where, it, is, abundant, suggesting, it, may, avoid, hotter, regions, it, also, avoids, deserts, secretarybirds, are, not, generally, gregarious, aside, from, pairs, and, their, offspring, they, usually, roost, in, trees, of, the, genus, acacia, or, balanites, or, even, introduced, pine, trees, in, south, africa, they, set, off, 1, 2, hours, after, dawn, generally, after, spending, some, time, preening, mated, pairs, roost, together, but, may, forage, separately, though, often, remaining, in, sight, of, one, another, they, pace, around, at, a, speed, of, 2, 5, 3, km, h, 1, 6, 1, 9, mph, taking, 120, steps, per, minute, on, average, after, spending, much, of, the, day, on, the, ground, secretarybirds, return, at, dusk, moving, downwind, before, flying, in, upwind, birds, encountered, singly, are, often, unattached, males, their, territories, generally, in, less, suitable, areas, conversely, larger, groups, of, up, to, 50, individuals, may, be, present, at, an, area, with, a, localised, resource, such, as, a, waterhole, in, a, dry, area, or, an, irruption, of, rodents, or, locusts, fleeing, a, fire, secretarybirds, soar, with, their, primary, feathers, splayed, to, manage, turbulence, their, wings, can, flap, though, in, a, slow, laborious, manner, and, requiring, uplift, to, be, sustained, otherwise, they, may, become, exhausted, in, the, heat, of, the, day, they, use, thermals, to, rise, up, to, 3, 800, m, 12, 500, ft, above, the, ground, the, bird, s, average, lifespan, is, thought, to, be, 10, to, 15, years, in, the, wild, and, up, to, 19, years, in, captivity, the, oldest, confirmed, secretarybird, in, the, wild, was, a, 5, year, old, that, was, banded, as, a, nestling, on, 23, july, 2011, in, bloemfontein, and, recovered, 440, km, 270, mi, away, in, mpumalanga, on, 7, june, 2016, secretarybirds, like, all, birds, have, haematozoan, blood, parasites, that, include, leucocytozoon, beaurepairei, dias, 1954, recorded, from, mozambique, wild, birds, from, tanzania, have, been, found, to, have, hepatozoon, ellisgreineri, a, genus, that, is, unique, among, avian, haematozoa, in, maturing, within, granulocytes, mainly, neutrophils, ectoparasites, include, the, lice, neocolpocephalum, cucullare, giebel, and, falcolipeurus, secretarius, giebel, secretarybirds, form, monogamous, pairs, and, defend, a, large, territory, of, around, 50, km, 2, 19, sq, mi, they, can, breed, at, any, time, of, the, year, more, frequently, in, the, late, dry, season, during, courtship, they, exhibit, a, nuptial, display, by, soaring, high, with, undulating, flight, patterns, and, calling, with, guttural, croaking, males, and, females, can, also, perform, a, ground, display, by, chasing, each, other, with, their, wings, up, and, back, which, is, also, the, way, they, defend, their, territory, they, mate, either, on, the, ground, or, in, trees, the, nest, is, built, by, both, sexes, at, the, top, of, a, dense, thorny, tree, often, an, acacia, at, a, height, of, between, 2, 5, and, 13, m, 8, and, 40, ft, above, the, ground, the, nest, is, constructed, as, a, relatively, flat, platform, of, sticks, 1, 0, 1, 5, m, 3, 5, ft, across, with, a, depth, 30, 50, cm, 12, 20, in, the, shallow, depression, is, lined, with, grass, and, the, occasional, piece, of, dung, eggs, are, laid, at, 2, to, 3, day, intervals, until, the, clutch, of, 1, 3, eggs, is, complete, the, elongated, chalky, bluish, green, or, white, eggs, average, 78, mm, 57, mm, 3, 1, in, 2, 2, in, and, weigh, 130, g, 4, 6, oz, both, parents, incubate, the, eggs, starting, as, soon, as, the, first, egg, is, laid, but, it, is, usually, the, female, that, remains, on, the, nest, overnight, the, incubating, parent, greets, its, partner, when, it, returns, with, a, display, of, bowing, and, bobbing, its, head, with, neck, extended, the, tail, is, held, upright, with, feathers, fanned, out, and, the, chest, feathers, are, puffed, out, the, eggs, hatch, after, around, 45, days, at, intervals, of, 2, 3, days, both, parents, feed, the, young, the, adults, regurgitate, food, onto, the, floor, of, the, nest, and, then, pick, up, items, and, pass, them, to, the, chicks, for, the, first, 2, or, 3, weeks, after, the, eggs, hatch, the, parents, take, turns, to, stay, at, the, nest, with, the, young, despite, the, difference, in, nestling, size, due, to, the, asynchronous, hatching, little, sibling, aggression, has, been, observed, under, favourable, conditions, all, chicks, from, a, clutch, of, three, eggs, fledge, but, if, food, is, scarce, one, or, more, of, the, chicks, will, die, from, starvation, the, young, may, be, preyed, upon, by, crows, ravens, hornbills, and, large, owls, the, young, are, born, covered, in, grey, white, down, that, becomes, darker, grey, after, two, weeks, their, bare, facial, skin, and, legs, are, yellow, crest, feathers, appear, at, 21, days, and, flight, feathers, by, 28, days, they, can, stand, up, and, feed, autonomously, after, 40, days, although, the, parents, still, feed, the, nestlings, after, that, time, at, 60, days, the, now, fully, feathered, young, start, to, flap, their, wings, their, weight, gain, over, this, period, changes, from, 56, g, 2, 0, oz, at, hatching, to, 500, g, 18, oz, at, 20, days, 1, 1, kg, 2, 4, lb, at, 30, days, 1, 7, kg, 3, 7, lb, at, 40, days, 2, kg, 4, 4, lb, at, 50, days, 2, 5, kg, 5, 5, lb, at, 60, days, and, 3, kg, 6, 6, lb, at, 70, days, the, time, they, leave, the, nest, can, be, anywhere, between, 65, and, 106, days, of, age, although, it, most, typically, occurs, between, 75, and, 80, days, of, age, fledging, is, accomplished, by, jumping, out, of, the, nest, or, using, a, semi, controlled, glide, to, the, ground, juveniles, remain, in, their, natal, range, before, dispersing, when, they, are, between, 4, and, 7, months, of, age, the, usual, age, at, which, they, first, breed, is, uncertain, but, there, is, a, record, of, a, male, bird, breeding, successfully, at, an, age, of, 2, years, and, 9, months, which, is, young, for, a, large, raptor, unlike, most, birds, of, prey, the, secretarybird, is, largely, terrestrial, hunting, its, prey, on, foot, adults, hunt, in, pairs, and, sometimes, as, loose, familial, flocks, stalking, through, the, habitat, with, long, strides, prey, may, consist, of, insects, such, as, locusts, other, grasshoppers, wasps, and, beetles, but, small, vertebrates, often, form, main, biomass, secretarybirds, are, known, to, hunt, rodents, frogs, lizards, small, tortoises, and, birds, such, as, warblers, larks, doves, small, hornbills, and, domestic, chickens, they, occasionally, prey, on, larger, mammals, such, as, hedgehogs, mongooses, small, felids, such, as, cheetah, cubs, striped, polecats, young, gazelles, and, both, young, and, full, grown, hares, the, importance, of, snakes, in, the, diet, has, been, exaggerated, in, the, past, although, they, can, be, locally, important, and, venomous, species, such, as, adders, and, cobras, are, regularly, among, the, types, of, snakes, preyed, upon, secretarybirds, do, not, eat, carrion, though, they, occasionally, eat, dead, animals, killed, in, grass, or, bushfires, the, birds, often, flush, prey, from, tall, grass, by, stomping, on, the, surrounding, vegetation, their, crest, feathers, may, raise, during, a, hunt, which, may, serve, to, help, scare, the, target, and, provide, shade, for, the, face, a, bird, will, chase, after, prey, with, the, wings, spread, and, kill, by, striking, with, swift, blows, of, the, feet, only, with, small, prey, items, such, as, wasps, will, the, bird, use, its, bill, to, pick, them, directly, there, are, some, reports, that, when, capturing, snakes, a, secretarybird, will, take, flight, with, their, prey, and, then, drop, them, to, their, death, although, this, has, not, been, verified, even, with, larger, prey, food, is, generally, swallowed, whole, through, the, birds, considerable, gape, occasionally, like, other, raptors, they, will, hold, down, a, food, item, with, their, feet, while, tearing, it, apart, with, their, bill, food, that, cannot, be, digested, is, regurgitated, as, pellets, 40, 45, mm, 1, 6, 1, 8, in, in, diameter, and, 30, 100, mm, 1, 2, 3, 9, in, in, length, these, are, dropped, on, the, ground, usually, near, the, roost, or, nest, trees, the, secretarybird, has, a, relatively, short, digestive, tract, in, comparison, to, large, african, birds, with, more, mixed, diets, such, as, the, kori, bustard, the, foregut, is, specialised, for, the, consumption, of, large, amounts, of, meat, and, there, is, little, need, for, the, mechanical, breakdown, of, food, the, crop, is, dilated, and, the, gizzard, is, nonmuscular, as, in, other, carnivorous, birds, the, large, intestine, has, a, pair, of, vestigial, ceca, as, there, is, no, requirement, for, the, fermentative, digestion, of, plant, material, secretarybirds, specialise, in, stomping, their, prey, until, it, is, killed, or, immobilised, this, method, of, hunting, is, commonly, applied, to, lizards, or, snakes, an, adult, male, trained, to, strike, at, a, rubber, snake, on, a, force, plate, was, found, to, hit, with, a, force, equal, to, five, times, its, own, body, weight, with, a, contact, period, of, only, 10, 15, milliseconds, this, short, time, of, contact, suggests, that, the, secretarybird, relies, on, superior, visual, targeting, to, determine, the, precise, location, of, the, prey, s, head, although, little, is, known, about, its, visual, field, it, is, assumed, that, it, is, large, frontal, and, binocular, secretarybirds, have, unusually, long, legs, nearly, twice, as, long, as, other, ground, birds, of, the, same, body, mass, which, is, thought, to, be, an, adaptation, for, the, bird, s, unique, stomping, and, striking, hunting, method, however, these, long, limbs, appear, to, also, lower, its, running, efficiency, ecophysiologist, steve, portugal, and, colleagues, have, hypothesised, that, the, extinct, phorusrhacidae, terror, birds, may, have, employed, a, similar, hunting, technique, to, secretarybirds, because, they, are, anatomically, similar, although, they, are, not, closely, related, secretarybirds, rarely, encounter, other, predators, except, in, the, case, of, tawny, eagles, which, will, steal, their, kills, eagles, mainly, steal, larger, prey, and, will, attack, secretarybirds, both, singly, or, in, pairs, secretarybird, pairs, are, sometimes, successful, in, driving, the, eagles, away, and, may, even, knock, them, down, and, pin, them, to, the, ground, the, secretarybird, is, depicted, on, an, ivory, knife, handle, recovered, from, abu, zaidan, in, upper, egypt, dating, to, the, naqada, iii, culture, c, 3, 200, bc, this, and, other, knife, handles, indicate, the, secretarybird, most, likely, occurred, historically, further, north, along, the, nile, the, secretarybird, has, traditionally, been, admired, in, africa, for, its, striking, appearance, and, ability, to, deal, with, pests, and, snakes, as, such, it, has, often, not, been, disturbed, although, this, is, changing, as, traditional, observances, have, declined, it, is, a, prominent, feature, on, the, coat, of, arms, of, south, africa, which, was, adopted, in, 2000, with, its, wings, outstretched, it, represents, growth, and, its, penchant, for, killing, snakes, is, symbolic, as, the, protector, of, the, south, african, state, against, enemies, it, is, on, the, emblem, of, sudan, adopted, in, 1969, it, is, featured, on, the, sudanese, presidential, flag, and, presidential, seal, the, secretarybird, has, been, a, common, motif, for, african, countries, on, postage, stamps, over, a, hundred, stamps, from, 37, issuers, are, known, including, some, from, stamp, issuing, entities, such, as, ajman, manama, and, the, maldives, regions, where, the, bird, does, not, exist, as, well, as, the, united, nations, the, maasai, people, call, it, ol, enbai, nabo, or, one, arrow, referring, to, its, crest, feathers, they, have, used, parts, of, the, bird, in, traditional, medicine, its, feathers, could, be, burnt, and, the, resulting, smoke, inhaled, to, treat, epilepsy, its, egg, could, be, consumed, with, tea, twice, daily, to, treat, headaches, and, its, fat, could, be, boiled, and, drunk, for, child, growth, or, livestock, health, the, xhosa, people, call, the, bird, inxhanxhosi, and, attribute, great, intelligence, to, it, in, folklore, the, zulus, call, it, intungunono, the, german, biologist, ragnar, kinzelbach, proposed, in, 2008, that, the, secretarybird, was, recorded, in, the, 13th, century, work, de, arte, venandi, cum, avibus, by, holy, roman, emperor, frederick, ii, described, as, bistarda, deserti, it, was, mistaken, for, a, bustard, frederick, most, likely, gained, knowledge, of, the, bird, from, sources, in, egypt, the, 16th, century, french, priest, and, traveller, andr, thevet, also, wrote, a, description, of, a, mysterious, bird, in, 1558, that, has, been, likened, by, kinzelbach, to, this, species, in, 1968, the, species, became, protected, under, the, african, convention, on, the, conservation, of, nature, and, natural, resources, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, listed, the, secretarybird, in, 2016, as, a, vulnerable, species, and, as, endangered, in, 2020, due, to, a, recent, rapid, decline, across, its, entire, range, although, widespread, the, species, is, thinly, distributed, across, its, range, its, population, has, been, estimated, in, 2016, to, be, anywhere, between, 6, 700, and, 67, 000, individuals, long, term, monitoring, across, south, africa, between, 1987, and, 2013, has, shown, that, populations, have, declined, across, the, country, even, in, protected, areas, such, as, kruger, national, park, due, to, woody, plant, encroachment, an, increase, in, the, tall, vegetation, cover, resulting, in, loss, of, open, habitat, that, the, species, prefers, as, a, population, the, secretarybird, is, mainly, threatened, by, loss, of, habitat, due, to, fragmentation, by, roads, and, development, and, overgrazing, of, grasslands, by, livestock, some, adaptation, to, altered, areas, has, been, recorded, but, the, trend, is, for, decline, the, first, successful, rearing, of, a, secretarybird, in, captivity, occurred, in, 1986, at, the, oklahoma, city, zoo, although, secretarybirds, normally, build, their, nests, in, the, trees, in, the, wild, the, captive, birds, at, the, zoo, built, theirs, on, the, ground, which, left, them, open, to, depredation, by, local, wild, mammals, to, address, this, problem, the, zoo, staff, removed, the, eggs, from, the, nest, each, time, they, were, laid, so, that, they, could, be, incubated, and, hatched, at, a, safer, location, the, species, has, also, been, bred, and, reared, in, captivity, at, the, san, diego, zoo, safari, park, in, june, 2024, a, secretarybird, chick, was, successfully, hatched, at, longleat, safari, park, in, wiltshire, born, to, parents, janine, and, kevin, who, have, lived, at, the, park, since, 2018, the, chick, s, gender, is, not, yet, known, and, keepers, are, providing, smaller, food, items, for, the, protective, parents, this, successful, hatch, is, seen, as, a, promising, step, towards, establishing, a, new, breeding, program, for, the, species, at, the, park
