a, pteridophyte, is, a, vascular, plant, with, xylem, and, phloem, that, reproduces, by, means, of, spores, because, pteridophytes, produce, neither, flowers, nor, seeds, they, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, cryptogams, meaning, that, their, means, of, reproduction, is, hidden, ferns, horsetails, often, treated, as, ferns, and, lycophytes, clubmosses, spikemosses, and, quillworts, are, all, pteridophytes, however, they, do, not, form, a, monophyletic, group, because, ferns, and, horsetails, are, more, closely, related, to, seed, plants, than, to, lycophytes, pteridophyta, is, thus, no, longer, a, widely, accepted, taxon, but, the, term, pteridophyte, remains, in, common, parlance, as, do, pteridology, and, pteridologist, as, a, science, and, its, practitioner, for, example, by, the, international, association, of, pteridologists, and, the, pteridophyte, phylogeny, group, pteridophytes, ferns, and, lycophytes, are, free, sporing, vascular, plants, that, have, a, life, cycle, with, alternating, free, living, gametophyte, and, sporophyte, phases, that, are, independent, at, maturity, the, body, of, the, sporophyte, is, well, differentiated, into, roots, stem, and, leaves, the, root, system, is, always, adventitious, the, stem, is, either, underground, or, aerial, the, leaves, may, be, microphylls, or, megaphylls, their, other, common, characteristics, include, vascular, plant, apomorphies, e, g, vascular, tissue, and, land, plant, plesiomorphies, e, g, spore, dispersal, and, the, absence, of, seeds, of, the, pteridophytes, ferns, account, for, nearly, 90, of, the, extant, diversity, smith, et, al, 2006, the, first, higher, level, pteridophyte, classification, published, in, the, molecular, phylogenetic, era, considered, the, ferns, as, monilophytes, as, follows, where, the, monilophytes, comprise, about, 9, 000, species, including, horsetails, equisetaceae, whisk, ferns, psilotaceae, and, all, eusporangiate, and, all, leptosporangiate, ferns, historically, both, lycophytes, and, monilophytes, were, grouped, together, as, pteridophytes, ferns, and, fern, allies, on, the, basis, of, being, spore, bearing, seed, free, in, smith, s, molecular, phylogenetic, study, the, ferns, are, characterised, by, lateral, root, origin, in, the, endodermis, usually, mesarch, protoxylem, in, shoots, a, pseudoendospore, plasmodial, tapetum, and, sperm, cells, with, 30, 1000, flagella, the, term, moniliform, as, in, moniliformopses, and, monilophytes, means, bead, shaped, and, was, introduced, by, kenrick, and, crane, 1997, as, a, scientific, replacement, for, fern, including, equisetaceae, and, became, established, by, pryer, et, al, 2004, christenhusz, and, chase, 2014, in, their, review, of, classification, schemes, provide, a, critique, of, this, usage, which, they, discouraged, as, irrational, in, fact, the, alternative, name, filicopsida, was, already, in, use, by, comparison, lycopod, or, lycophyte, club, moss, means, wolf, plant, the, term, fern, ally, included, under, pteridophyta, generally, refers, to, vascular, spore, bearing, plants, that, are, not, ferns, including, lycopods, horsetails, whisk, ferns, and, water, ferns, marsileaceae, salviniaceae, and, ceratopteris, this, is, not, a, natural, grouping, but, rather, a, convenient, term, for, non, fern, and, is, also, discouraged, as, is, eusporangiate, for, non, leptosporangiate, ferns, however, both, infradivision, and, moniliformopses, are, also, invalid, names, under, the, international, code, of, botanical, nomenclature, ferns, despite, forming, a, monophyletic, clade, are, formally, only, considered, as, four, classes, psilotopsida, equisetopsida, marattiopsida, polypodiopsida, 11, orders, and, 37, families, without, assigning, a, higher, taxonomic, rank, furthermore, within, the, polypodiopsida, the, largest, grouping, a, number, of, informal, clades, were, recognised, including, leptosporangiates, core, leptosporangiates, polypods, polypodiales, and, eupolypods, including, eupolypods, i, and, eupolypods, ii, in, 2014, christenhusz, and, chase, summarising, the, known, knowledge, at, that, time, treated, this, group, as, two, separate, unrelated, taxa, in, a, consensus, classification, these, subclasses, correspond, to, smith, s, four, classes, with, ophioglossidae, corresponding, to, psilotopsida, the, two, major, groups, previously, included, in, pteridophyta, are, phylogenetically, related, as, follows, lycopodiophyta, polypodiophyta, ferns, gymnospermae, angiospermae, flowering, plants, pteridophytes, consist, of, two, separate, but, related, classes, whose, nomenclature, has, varied, the, system, put, forward, by, the, pteridophyte, phylogeny, group, in, 2016, ppg, i, is, in, addition, to, these, living, groups, several, groups, of, pteridophytes, are, now, extinct, and, known, only, from, fossils, these, groups, include, the, rhyniopsida, zosterophyllopsida, trimerophytopsida, the, lepidodendrales, and, the, progymnospermopsida, modern, studies, of, the, land, plants, agree, that, seed, plants, emerged, from, pteridophytes, more, closer, to, ferns, than, lycophytes, therefore, pteridophytes, do, not, form, a, clade, but, constitute, a, paraphyletic, grade, just, as, with, bryophytes, and, spermatophytes, seed, plants, the, life, cycle, of, pteridophytes, involves, alternation, of, generations, this, means, that, a, diploid, generation, the, sporophyte, which, produces, spores, is, followed, by, a, haploid, generation, the, gametophyte, or, prothallus, which, produces, gametes, pteridophytes, differ, from, bryophytes, in, that, the, sporophyte, is, branched, and, generally, much, larger, and, more, conspicuous, and, from, seed, plants, in, that, both, generations, are, independent, and, free, living, the, sexuality, of, pteridophyte, gametophytes, can, be, classified, as, follows, these, terms, are, not, the, same, as, monoecious, and, dioecious, which, refer, to, whether, a, seed, plant, s, sporophyte, bears, both, male, and, female, gametophytes, i, e, produces, both, pollen, and, seeds, or, just, one, of, the, sexes
