the, denisovans, or, denisova, hominins, d, n, i, s, v, d, nee, s, v, are, an, extinct, species, or, subspecies, of, archaic, human, that, ranged, across, asia, during, the, lower, and, middle, paleolithic, and, lived, based, on, current, evidence, from, 285, to, 25, thousand, years, ago, denisovans, are, known, from, few, physical, remains, consequently, most, of, what, is, known, about, them, comes, from, dna, evidence, no, formal, species, name, has, been, established, pending, more, complete, fossil, material, the, first, identification, of, a, denisovan, individual, occurred, in, 2010, based, on, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, extracted, from, a, juvenile, female, finger, bone, excavated, from, the, siberian, denisova, cave, in, the, altai, mountains, in, 2008, nuclear, dna, indicates, close, affinities, with, neanderthals, the, cave, was, also, periodically, inhabited, by, neanderthals, but, it, is, unclear, whether, neanderthals, and, denisovans, ever, cohabited, in, the, cave, additional, specimens, from, denisova, cave, were, subsequently, identified, as, was, a, single, specimen, from, the, baishiya, karst, cave, on, the, tibetan, plateau, and, cobra, cave, in, the, annamite, mountains, of, laos, dna, evidence, suggests, they, had, dark, skin, eyes, and, hair, and, had, a, neanderthal, like, build, and, facial, features, however, they, had, larger, molars, which, are, reminiscent, of, middle, to, late, pleistocene, archaic, humans, and, australopithecines, denisovans, apparently, interbred, with, modern, humans, with, a, high, percentage, roughly, 5, occurring, in, melanesians, aboriginal, australians, and, filipino, negritos, this, distribution, suggests, that, there, were, denisovan, populations, across, asia, there, is, also, evidence, of, interbreeding, with, the, altai, neanderthal, population, with, about, 17, of, the, denisovan, genome, from, denisova, cave, deriving, from, them, a, first, generation, hybrid, nicknamed, denny, was, discovered, with, a, denisovan, father, and, a, neanderthal, mother, additionally, 4, of, the, denisovan, genome, comes, from, an, unknown, archaic, human, species, which, diverged, from, modern, humans, over, one, million, years, ago, denisovans, may, represent, a, new, species, of, homo, or, an, archaic, subspecies, of, homo, sapiens, modern, humans, but, there, are, too, few, fossils, to, erect, a, proper, taxon, proactively, proposed, species, names, for, denisovans, are, h, denisova, or, h, altaiensis, chinese, researchers, suggest, the, denisovans, were, members, of, homo, longi, and, the, idea, has, been, supported, by, the, palaeontologist, chris, stringer, denisova, cave, is, in, south, central, siberia, russia, in, the, altai, mountains, near, the, border, with, kazakhstan, china, and, mongolia, it, is, named, after, denis, dyonisiy, a, russian, hermit, who, lived, there, in, the, 18th, century, the, cave, was, first, inspected, for, fossils, in, the, 1970s, by, russian, paleontologist, nikolai, ovodov, who, was, looking, for, remains, of, canids, in, 2008, michael, shunkov, from, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, and, other, russian, archaeologists, from, the, institute, of, archaeology, and, ethnography, of, the, siberian, branch, of, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, in, novosibirsk, akademgorodok, investigated, the, cave, and, found, the, finger, bone, of, a, juvenile, female, hominin, originally, dated, to, 50, 30, 000, years, ago, the, estimate, has, changed, to, 76, 200, 51, 600, years, ago, the, specimen, was, originally, named, x, woman, because, matrilineal, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, extracted, from, the, bone, demonstrated, it, to, belong, to, a, novel, ancient, hominin, genetically, distinct, both, from, contemporary, modern, humans, and, from, neanderthals, in, 2019, greek, archaeologist, katerina, douka, and, colleagues, radiocarbon, dated, specimens, from, denisova, cave, and, estimated, that, denisova, 2, the, oldest, specimen, lived, 195, 000, 122, 700, years, ago, older, denisovan, dna, collected, from, sediments, in, the, east, chamber, dates, to, 217, 000, years, ago, based, on, artifacts, also, discovered, in, the, cave, hominin, occupation, most, likely, by, denisovans, began, 287, 41, or, 203, 14, ka, neanderthals, were, also, present, 193, 12, ka, and, 97, 11, ka, possibly, concurrently, with, denisovans, the, fossils, of, multiple, distinct, denisovan, individuals, from, denisova, cave, have, been, identified, through, their, ancient, dna, adna, denisova, 2, 3, 4, 8, 11, and, 25, an, mtdna, based, phylogenetic, analysis, of, these, individuals, suggested, that, denisova, 2, is, the, oldest, followed, by, denisova, 8, while, denisova, 3, and, denisova, 4, were, roughly, contemporaneous, in, 2024, scientists, announced, the, sequence, of, denisova, 25, which, was, in, a, layer, dated, to, 200ka, during, dna, sequencing, a, low, proportion, of, the, denisova, 2, denisova, 4, and, denisova, 8, genomes, were, found, to, have, survived, but, a, high, proportion, of, the, denisova, 3, and, denisova, 25, genomes, were, intact, the, denisova, 3, sample, was, cut, into, two, and, the, initial, dna, sequencing, of, one, fragment, was, later, independently, confirmed, by, sequencing, the, mtdna, from, the, second, denisova, cave, contained, the, only, known, examples, of, denisovans, until, 2019, when, a, research, group, led, by, fahu, chen, dongju, zhang, and, jean, jacques, hublin, described, a, partial, mandible, discovered, in, 1980, by, a, buddhist, monk, in, the, baishiya, karst, cave, on, the, tibetan, plateau, in, china, known, as, the, xiahe, mandible, the, fossil, became, part, of, the, collection, of, lanzhou, university, where, it, remained, unstudied, until, 2010, it, was, determined, by, ancient, protein, analysis, to, contain, collagen, that, by, sequence, was, found, to, have, close, affiliation, to, that, of, the, denisovans, from, denisova, cave, while, uranium, decay, dating, of, the, carbonate, crust, enshrouding, the, specimen, indicated, it, was, more, than, 160, 000, years, old, the, identity, of, this, population, was, later, confirmed, through, study, of, environmental, dna, which, found, denisovan, mtdna, in, sediment, layers, ranging, in, date, from, 100, 000, to, 60, 000, years, before, present, and, perhaps, more, recent, in, 2018, a, team, of, laotian, french, and, american, anthropologists, who, had, been, excavating, caves, in, the, laotian, jungle, of, the, annamite, mountains, since, 2008, was, directed, by, local, children, to, the, site, tam, ngu, hao, 2, cobra, cave, where, they, recovered, a, human, tooth, the, tooth, catalogue, number, tnh2, 1, developmentally, matches, a, 3, 5, to, 8, 5, year, old, and, a, lack, of, amelogenin, a, protein, on, the, y, chromosome, suggests, it, belonged, to, a, girl, barring, extreme, degradation, of, the, protein, over, a, long, period, of, time, dental, proteome, analysis, was, inconclusive, for, this, specimen, but, the, team, found, it, anatomically, comparable, with, the, xiahe, mandible, and, so, tentatively, categorized, it, as, a, denisovan, although, they, could, not, rule, out, it, being, neanderthal, the, tooth, probably, dates, to, 164, 000, to, 131, 000, years, ago, in, 2024, a, zooms, analysis, of, more, than, 2, 500, bones, found, in, baishiya, karst, cave, revealed, a, further, bone, fragment, a, rib, bone, dating, from, between, 48, 000, bp, and, 32, 000, bp, the, conclusion, of, the, zooms, analysis, was, there, was, no, evidence, of, any, other, human, group, having, occupied, the, cave, other, bone, fragments, included, a, large, number, of, blue, sheep, wild, yaks, woolly, rhino, spotted, hyena, marmots, other, small, mammals, and, birds, examination, of, the, animal, bone, surfaces, indicates, the, denisovans, removed, meat, and, bone, marrow, from, the, bones, and, also, show, the, humans, used, them, as, raw, material, to, make, tools, there, was, also, evidence, of, stone, artefacts, in, each, layer, excavated, some, older, findings, may, or, may, not, belong, to, the, denisovan, line, but, asia, is, not, well, mapped, in, regards, to, human, evolution, such, findings, include, the, dali, skull, the, xujiayao, hominin, maba, man, the, jinniushan, hominin, and, the, narmada, human, the, xiahe, mandible, shows, morphological, similarities, to, some, later, east, asian, fossils, such, as, penghu, 1, but, also, to, chinese, h, erectus, in, 2021, chinese, palaeoanthropologist, qiang, ji, suggested, his, newly, erected, species, h, longi, may, represent, the, denisovans, based, on, the, similarity, between, the, type, specimen, s, molar, and, that, of, the, xiahe, mandible, ku131206, sequenced, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, preserved, by, the, cool, climate, of, the, cave, average, temperature, is, at, freezing, point, was, extracted, from, denisova, 3, by, a, team, of, scientists, led, by, johannes, krause, and, svante, p, bo, from, the, max, planck, institute, for, evolutionary, anthropology, in, leipzig, germany, denisova, 3, s, mtdna, differs, from, that, of, modern, humans, by, 385, bases, nucleotides, out, of, approximately, 16, 500, whereas, the, difference, between, modern, humans, and, neanderthals, is, around, 202, bases, in, comparison, the, difference, between, chimpanzees, and, modern, humans, is, approximately, 1, 462, mtdna, base, pairs, this, suggested, that, denisovan, mtdna, diverged, from, that, of, modern, humans, and, neanderthals, about, 1, 313, 500, 779, 300, years, ago, whereas, modern, human, and, neanderthal, mtdna, diverged, 618, 000, 321, 200, years, ago, krause, and, colleagues, then, concluded, that, denisovans, were, the, descendants, of, an, earlier, migration, of, h, erectus, out, of, africa, completely, distinct, from, modern, humans, and, neanderthals, however, according, to, the, nuclear, dna, ndna, of, denisova, 3, which, had, an, unusual, degree, of, dna, preservation, with, only, low, level, contamination, denisovans, and, neanderthals, were, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, they, were, to, modern, humans, using, the, percent, distance, from, human, chimpanzee, last, common, ancestor, denisovans, neanderthals, split, from, modern, humans, about, 804, 000, years, ago, and, from, each, other, 640, 000, years, ago, using, a, mutation, rate, of, 1, 10, 9, or, 0, 5, 10, 9, per, base, pair, bp, per, year, the, neanderthal, denisovan, split, occurred, around, either, 236, 190, 000, or, 473, 381, 000, years, ago, respectively, using, 1, 1, 10, 8, per, generation, with, a, new, generation, every, 29, years, the, time, is, 744, 000, years, ago, using, 5, 10, 10, nucleotide, site, per, year, it, is, 616, 000, years, ago, using, the, latter, dates, the, split, had, likely, already, occurred, by, the, time, hominins, spread, out, across, europe, h, heidelbergensis, is, typically, considered, to, have, been, the, direct, ancestor, of, denisovans, and, neanderthals, and, sometimes, also, modern, humans, due, to, the, strong, divergence, in, dental, anatomy, they, may, have, split, before, characteristic, neanderthal, dentition, evolved, about, 300, 000, years, ago, the, more, divergent, denisovan, mtdna, has, been, interpreted, as, evidence, of, admixture, between, denisovans, and, an, unknown, archaic, human, population, possibly, a, relict, h, erectus, or, h, erectus, like, population, about, 53, 000, years, ago, alternatively, divergent, mtdna, could, have, also, resulted, from, the, persistence, of, an, ancient, mtdna, lineage, which, only, went, extinct, in, modern, humans, and, neanderthals, through, genetic, drift, modern, humans, contributed, mtdna, to, the, neanderthal, lineage, but, not, to, the, denisovan, mitochondrial, genomes, yet, sequenced, the, mtdna, sequence, from, the, femur, of, a, 400, 000, year, old, h, heidelbergensis, from, the, sima, de, los, huesos, cave, in, spain, was, found, to, be, related, to, those, of, neanderthals, and, denisovans, but, closer, to, denisovans, and, the, authors, posited, that, this, mtdna, represents, an, archaic, sequence, which, was, subsequently, lost, in, neanderthals, due, to, replacement, by, a, modern, human, related, sequence, denisovans, are, known, to, have, lived, in, siberia, tibet, and, laos, the, xiahe, mandible, is, the, earliest, recorded, human, presence, on, the, tibetan, plateau, though, their, remains, have, been, identified, in, only, these, three, locations, traces, of, denisovan, dna, in, modern, humans, suggest, they, ranged, across, east, asia, and, potentially, western, eurasia, in, 2019, geneticist, guy, jacobs, and, colleagues, identified, three, distinct, populations, of, denisovans, responsible, for, the, introgression, into, modern, populations, now, native, to, respectively, siberia, and, east, asia, new, guinea, and, nearby, islands, and, oceania, and, to, a, lesser, extent, across, asia, using, coalescent, modeling, the, denisova, cave, denisovans, split, from, the, second, population, about, 283, 000, years, ago, and, from, the, third, population, about, 363, 000, years, ago, this, indicates, that, there, was, considerable, reproductive, isolation, between, denisovan, populations, in, a, 2024, study, scientist, danat, yermakovich, of, the, university, of, tartu, discovered, that, people, living, at, different, elevations, in, papa, new, guinea, have, differences, in, denisovan, dna, with, people, living, in, the, highlands, having, variants, for, early, brain, development, and, those, living, in, the, lowlands, having, variants, for, the, immune, system, based, on, the, high, percentages, of, denisovan, dna, in, modern, papuans, and, australians, denisovans, may, have, crossed, the, wallace, line, into, these, regions, with, little, back, migration, west, the, second, known, human, species, to, do, so, along, with, earlier, homo, floresiensis, by, this, logic, they, may, have, also, entered, the, philippines, living, alongside, h, luzonensis, which, if, this, is, the, case, may, represent, the, same, or, a, closely, related, species, these, denisovans, may, have, needed, to, cross, large, bodies, of, water, alternately, high, denisovan, dna, admixture, in, modern, papuan, populations, may, simply, represent, higher, mixing, among, the, original, ancestors, of, papuans, prior, to, crossing, the, wallace, line, icelanders, also, have, an, anomalously, high, denisovan, heritage, which, could, have, stemmed, from, a, denisovan, population, far, west, of, the, altai, mountains, genetic, data, suggests, neanderthals, were, frequently, making, long, crossings, between, europe, and, the, altai, mountains, especially, towards, the, date, of, their, extinction, using, exponential, distribution, analysis, on, haplotype, lengths, jacobs, calculated, introgression, into, modern, humans, occurred, about, 29, 900, years, ago, with, the, denisovan, population, ancestral, to, new, guineans, and, 45, 700, years, ago, with, the, population, ancestral, to, both, new, guineans, and, oceanians, such, a, late, date, for, the, new, guinean, group, could, indicate, denisovan, survival, as, late, as, 14, 500, years, ago, which, would, make, them, the, latest, surviving, archaic, human, species, a, third, wave, appears, to, have, introgressed, into, east, asia, but, there, is, not, enough, dna, evidence, to, pinpoint, a, solid, timeframe, the, mtdna, from, denisova, 4, bore, a, high, similarity, to, that, of, denisova, 3, indicating, that, they, belonged, to, the, same, population, the, genetic, diversity, among, the, denisovans, from, denisova, cave, is, on, the, lower, range, of, what, is, seen, in, modern, humans, and, is, comparable, to, that, of, neanderthals, however, it, is, possible, that, the, inhabitants, of, denisova, cave, were, more, or, less, reproductively, isolated, from, other, denisovans, and, that, across, their, entire, range, denisovan, genetic, diversity, may, have, been, much, higher, denisova, cave, over, time, of, habitation, continually, swung, from, a, fairly, warm, and, moderately, humid, pine, and, birch, forest, to, tundra, or, forest, tundra, landscape, conversely, baishiya, karst, cave, is, situated, at, a, high, elevation, an, area, characterized, by, low, temperature, low, oxygen, and, poor, resource, availability, colonization, of, high, altitude, regions, due, to, such, harsh, conditions, was, previously, assumed, to, have, only, been, accomplished, by, modern, humans, denisovans, seem, to, have, also, inhabited, the, jungles, of, southeast, asia, the, tam, ngu, hao, 2, site, might, have, been, a, closed, forest, environment, little, is, known, of, the, precise, anatomical, features, of, the, denisovans, since, the, only, physical, remains, discovered, so, far, are, a, finger, bone, four, teeth, long, bone, fragments, a, partial, jawbone, a, parietal, bone, skull, fragment, and, a, rib, bone, the, finger, bone, is, within, the, modern, human, range, of, variation, for, women, which, is, in, contrast, to, the, large, robust, molars, which, are, more, similar, to, those, of, middle, to, late, pleistocene, archaic, humans, the, third, molar, is, outside, the, range, of, any, homo, species, except, h, habilis, and, h, rudolfensis, and, is, more, like, those, of, australopithecines, the, second, molar, is, larger, than, those, of, modern, humans, and, neanderthals, and, is, more, similar, to, those, of, h, erectus, and, h, habilis, like, neanderthals, the, mandible, had, a, gap, behind, the, molars, and, the, front, teeth, were, flattened, but, denisovans, lacked, a, high, mandibular, body, and, the, mandibular, symphysis, at, the, midline, of, the, jaw, was, more, receding, the, parietal, is, reminiscent, of, that, of, h, erectus, a, facial, reconstruction, has, been, generated, by, comparing, methylation, at, individual, genetic, loci, associated, with, facial, structure, this, analysis, suggested, that, denisovans, much, like, neanderthals, had, a, long, broad, and, projecting, face, large, nose, sloping, forehead, protruding, jaw, elongated, and, flattened, skull, and, wide, chest, and, hips, the, denisovan, tooth, row, was, longer, than, that, of, neanderthals, and, anatomically, modern, humans, middle, to, late, pleistocene, east, asian, archaic, human, skullcaps, typically, share, features, with, neanderthals, the, skullcaps, from, xuchang, feature, prominent, brow, ridges, like, neanderthals, though, the, nuchal, and, angular, tori, near, the, base, of, the, skull, are, either, reduced, or, absent, and, the, back, of, the, skull, is, rounded, off, like, in, early, modern, humans, xuchang, 1, had, a, large, brain, volume, of, approximately, 1800, cc, on, the, high, end, for, neanderthals, and, early, modern, humans, and, well, beyond, the, present, day, human, average, the, denisovan, genome, from, denisova, cave, has, variants, of, genes, which, in, modern, humans, are, associated, with, dark, skin, brown, hair, and, brown, eyes, the, denisovan, genome, also, contains, a, variant, region, around, the, epas1, gene, that, in, tibetans, assists, with, adaptation, to, low, oxygen, levels, at, high, elevation, and, in, a, region, containing, the, wars2, and, tbx15, loci, which, affect, body, fat, distribution, in, the, inuit, in, papuans, introgressed, neanderthal, alleles, are, highest, in, frequency, in, genes, expressed, in, the, brain, whereas, denisovan, alleles, have, highest, frequency, in, genes, expressed, in, bones, and, other, tissue, early, middle, paleolithic, stone, tools, from, denisova, cave, included, cores, scrapers, denticulate, tools, and, notched, tools, deposited, about, 287, 41, thousand, years, ago, in, the, main, chamber, of, the, cave, and, about, 269, 97, thousand, years, ago, in, the, south, chamber, up, to, 170, 19, thousand, and, 187, 14, thousand, years, ago, in, the, main, and, east, chambers, respectively, middle, paleolithic, assemblages, were, dominated, by, flat, discoidal, and, levallois, cores, and, there, were, some, isolated, sub, prismatic, cores, there, were, predominantly, side, scrapers, a, scraper, with, only, the, sides, used, to, scrape, but, also, notched, denticulate, tools, end, scrapers, a, scraper, with, only, the, ends, used, to, scrape, burins, chisel, like, tools, and, truncated, flakes, these, dated, to, 156, 15, thousand, years, ago, in, the, main, chamber, 58, 6, thousand, years, ago, in, the, east, chamber, and, 136, 26, 47, 8, thousand, years, ago, in, the, south, chamber, early, upper, paleolithic, artefacts, date, to, 44, 5, thousand, years, ago, in, the, main, chamber, 63, 6, thousand, years, ago, in, the, east, chamber, and, 47, 8, thousand, years, ago, in, the, south, chamber, though, some, layers, of, the, east, chamber, seem, to, have, been, disturbed, there, was, blade, production, and, levallois, production, but, scrapers, were, again, predominant, a, well, developed, upper, paleolithic, stone, bladelet, technology, distinct, from, the, previous, scrapers, began, accumulating, in, the, main, chamber, around, 36, 4, thousand, years, ago, in, the, upper, paleolithic, layers, there, were, also, several, bone, tools, and, ornaments, a, marble, ring, an, ivory, ring, an, ivory, pendant, a, red, deer, tooth, pendant, an, elk, tooth, pendant, a, chloritolite, bracelet, and, a, bone, needle, however, denisovans, are, only, confirmed, to, have, inhabited, the, cave, until, 55, ka, the, dating, of, upper, paleolithic, artefacts, overlaps, with, modern, human, migration, into, siberia, though, there, are, no, occurrences, in, the, altai, region, and, the, dna, of, the, only, specimen, in, the, cave, dating, to, the, time, interval, denisova, 14, is, too, degraded, to, confirm, species, identity, so, the, attribution, of, these, artefacts, is, unclear, in, 1998, five, child, hand, and, footprint, impressions, were, discovered, in, a, travertine, unit, near, the, quesang, hot, springs, in, tibet, in, 2021, they, were, dated, to, 226, to, 169, thousand, years, ago, using, uranium, decay, dating, this, is, the, oldest, evidence, of, human, occupation, of, the, tibetan, plateau, and, since, the, xiahe, mandible, is, the, oldest, human, fossil, from, the, region, though, younger, than, the, quesang, impressions, these, may, have, been, made, by, denisovan, children, the, impressions, were, printed, onto, a, small, panel, of, space, and, there, is, little, overlap, between, all, the, prints, so, they, seem, to, have, been, taking, care, to, make, new, imprints, in, unused, space, if, considered, art, they, are, the, oldest, known, examples, of, rock, art, similar, hand, stencils, and, impressions, do, not, appear, again, in, the, archeological, record, until, roughly, 40, 000, years, ago, the, footprints, comprise, four, right, impressions, and, one, left, superimposed, on, one, of, the, rights, they, were, probably, left, by, two, individuals, the, tracks, of, the, individual, who, superimposed, their, left, onto, their, right, may, have, scrunched, up, their, toes, and, wiggled, them, in, the, mud, or, dug, their, finger, into, the, toe, prints, the, footprints, average, 192, 3, mm, 7, 57, in, long, which, roughly, equates, to, a, 7, or, 8, year, old, child, by, modern, human, growth, rates, there, are, two, sets, of, handprints, from, a, left, and, right, hand, which, may, have, been, created, by, an, older, child, unless, one, of, the, former, two, individuals, had, long, fingers, the, handprints, average, 161, 1, mm, 6, 34, in, which, roughly, equates, with, a, 12, year, old, modern, human, child, and, the, middle, finger, length, agrees, with, a, 17, year, old, modern, human, one, of, the, handprints, shows, an, impression, of, the, forearm, and, the, individual, was, wiggling, their, thumb, through, the, mud, analyses, of, the, modern, human, genomes, indicate, past, interbreeding, with, at, least, two, groups, of, archaic, humans, neanderthals, and, denisovans, and, that, such, interbreeding, events, occurred, on, multiple, occasions, comparisons, of, the, denisovan, neanderthal, and, modern, human, genomes, have, revealed, evidence, of, a, complex, web, of, interbreeding, among, these, lineages, as, much, as, 17, of, the, denisovan, genome, from, denisova, cave, represents, dna, from, the, local, neanderthal, population, denisova, 11, was, an, f1, first, generation, denisovan, neanderthal, hybrid, the, fact, that, such, an, individual, was, found, may, indicate, interbreeding, was, a, common, occurrence, here, the, denisovan, genome, shares, more, derived, alleles, with, the, altai, neanderthal, genome, from, siberia, than, with, the, vindija, cave, neanderthal, genome, from, croatia, or, the, mezmaiskaya, cave, neanderthal, genome, from, the, caucasus, suggesting, that, the, gene, flow, came, from, a, population, that, was, more, closely, related, to, the, local, altai, neanderthals, however, denny, s, denisovan, father, had, the, typical, altai, neanderthal, introgression, while, her, neanderthal, mother, represented, a, population, more, closely, related, to, vindija, neanderthals, denisova, 25, dated, to, 200ka, is, estimated, to, have, inherited, 5, of, his, genome, from, a, previously, unknown, population, of, neanderthals, and, came, from, a, different, population, of, denisovans, than, the, younger, samples, about, 4, of, the, denisovan, genome, derives, from, an, unidentified, archaic, hominin, perhaps, the, source, of, the, anomalous, ancient, mtdna, indicating, this, species, diverged, from, neanderthals, and, humans, over, a, million, years, ago, the, only, identified, homo, species, of, late, pleistocene, asia, are, h, erectus, and, h, heidelbergensis, though, in, 2021, specimens, allocated, to, the, latter, species, were, reclassified, as, h, longi, and, h, daliensis, before, splitting, from, neanderthals, their, ancestors, neandersovans, migrating, into, europe, apparently, interbred, with, an, unidentified, superarchaic, human, species, who, were, already, present, there, these, superarchaics, were, the, descendants, of, a, very, early, migration, out, of, africa, around, 1, 9, mya, a, 2011, study, found, that, denisovan, dna, is, prevalent, in, papuans, aboriginal, australians, near, oceanians, polynesians, fijians, eastern, indonesians, and, aeta, from, the, philippines, but, not, in, east, asians, western, indonesians, jahai, people, from, malaysia, or, onge, from, the, andaman, islands, this, may, suggest, that, denisovan, introgression, occurred, within, the, pacific, region, rather, than, on, the, asian, mainland, and, that, ancestors, of, the, latter, groups, were, not, present, in, southeast, asia, at, the, time, in, the, melanesian, genome, about, 4, 6, or, 1, 9, 3, 4, derives, from, denisovan, introgression, prior, to, 2021, new, guineans, and, australian, aborigines, were, reported, to, have, the, most, introgressed, dna, but, australians, have, less, than, new, guineans, a, 2021, study, discovered, 30, to, 40, more, denisovan, ancestry, in, aeta, people, in, the, philippines, than, in, papuans, estimated, as, about, 5, of, the, genome, the, aeta, magbukon, in, luzon, have, the, highest, known, proportion, of, denisovan, ancestry, of, any, population, in, the, world, in, papuans, less, denisovan, ancestry, is, seen, in, the, x, chromosome, than, autosomes, and, some, autosomes, such, as, chromosome, 11, also, have, less, denisovan, ancestry, which, could, indicate, hybrid, incompatibility, the, former, observation, could, also, be, explained, by, less, female, denisovan, introgression, into, modern, humans, or, more, female, modern, human, immigrants, who, diluted, denisovan, x, chromosome, ancestry, in, contrast, 0, 2, derives, from, denisovan, ancestry, in, mainland, asians, and, native, americans, south, asians, were, found, to, have, levels, of, denisovan, admixture, similar, to, that, seen, in, east, asians, the, discovery, of, the, 40, 000, year, old, chinese, modern, human, tianyuan, man, lacking, denisovan, dna, significantly, different, from, the, levels, in, modern, day, east, asians, discounts, the, hypothesis, that, immigrating, modern, humans, simply, diluted, denisovan, ancestry, whereas, melanesians, lived, in, reproductive, isolation, a, 2018, study, of, han, chinese, japanese, and, dai, genomes, showed, that, modern, east, asians, have, dna, from, two, different, denisovan, populations, one, similar, to, the, denisovan, dna, found, in, papuan, genomes, and, a, second, that, is, closer, to, the, denisovan, genome, from, denisova, cave, this, could, indicate, two, separate, introgression, events, involving, two, different, denisovan, populations, in, south, asian, genomes, dna, only, came, from, the, same, single, denisovan, introgression, seen, in, papuans, a, 2019, study, found, a, third, wave, of, denisovans, which, introgressed, into, east, asians, introgression, also, may, not, have, immediately, occurred, when, modern, humans, immigrated, into, the, region, the, timing, of, introgression, into, oceanian, populations, likely, occurred, after, eurasians, and, oceanians, split, roughly, 58, 000, years, ago, and, before, papuan, and, aboriginal, australians, split, from, each, other, roughly, 37, 000, years, ago, given, the, present, day, distribution, of, denisovan, dna, this, may, have, taken, place, in, wallacea, though, the, discovery, of, a, 7, 200, year, old, toalean, girl, closely, related, to, papuans, and, aboriginal, australians, from, sulawesi, carrying, denisovan, dna, makes, sundaland, another, potential, candidate, other, early, sunda, hunter, gatherers, so, far, sequenced, carry, very, little, denisovan, dna, which, either, means, the, introgression, event, did, not, take, place, in, sundaland, or, denisovan, ancestry, was, diluted, with, gene, flow, from, the, mainland, asian, h, ab, nhian, culture, and, subsequent, neolithic, cultures, in, other, regions, of, the, world, archaic, introgression, into, humans, stems, from, a, group, of, neanderthals, related, to, those, which, inhabited, vindija, cave, croatia, as, opposed, to, archaics, related, to, siberian, neanderthals, and, denisovans, however, about, 3, 3, of, the, archaic, dna, in, the, modern, icelandic, genome, descends, from, the, denisovans, and, such, a, high, percentage, could, indicate, a, western, eurasian, population, of, denisovans, which, introgressed, into, either, vindija, related, neanderthals, or, immigrating, modern, humans, denisovan, genes, may, have, helped, early, modern, humans, migrating, out, of, africa, to, acclimatize, although, not, present, in, the, sequenced, denisovan, genome, the, distribution, pattern, and, divergence, of, hla, b, 73, from, other, hla, alleles, involved, in, the, immune, system, s, natural, killer, cell, receptors, has, led, to, the, suggestion, that, it, introgressed, from, denisovans, into, modern, humans, in, west, asia, in, a, 2011, study, half, of, the, hla, alleles, of, modern, eurasians, were, shown, to, represent, archaic, hla, haplotypes, and, were, inferred, to, be, of, denisovan, or, neanderthal, origin, a, haplotype, of, epas1, in, modern, tibetans, which, allows, them, to, live, at, high, elevations, in, a, low, oxygen, environment, likely, came, from, denisovans, genes, related, to, phospholipid, transporters, which, are, involved, in, fat, metabolism, and, to, trace, amine, associated, receptors, involved, in, smelling, are, more, active, in, people, with, more, denisovan, ancestry, denisovan, genes, may, have, conferred, a, degree, of, immunity, against, the, g614, mutation, of, sars, cov, 2, denisovan, introgressions, may, have, influenced, the, immune, system, of, present, day, papuans, and, potentially, favoured, variants, to, immune, related, phenotypes, and, adaptation, to, the, local, environment, in, december, 2023, scientists, reported, that, genes, inherited, by, modern, humans, from, neanderthals, and, denisovans, may, biologically, influence, the, daily, routine, of, modern, humans
