see, text, amaryllis, m, r, l, s, is, the, only, genus, in, the, subtribe, amaryllidinae, tribe, amaryllideae, it, is, a, small, genus, of, flowering, bulbs, with, two, species, the, better, known, of, the, two, amaryllis, belladonna, is, a, native, of, the, western, cape, region, of, south, africa, particularly, the, rocky, southwest, area, between, the, olifants, river, valley, and, knysna, for, many, years, there, was, confusion, among, botanists, over, the, generic, names, amaryllis, and, hippeastrum, one, result, of, which, is, that, the, common, name, amaryllis, is, mainly, used, for, cultivars, of, the, genus, hippeastrum, widely, sold, in, the, winter, months, for, their, ability, to, bloom, indoors, plants, of, the, genus, amaryllis, are, known, as, belladonna, lily, jersey, lily, naked, lady, amarillo, easter, lily, in, southern, australia, or, in, south, africa, march, lily, due, to, its, propensity, to, flower, around, march, this, is, one, of, numerous, genera, with, the, common, name, lily, due, to, their, flower, shape, and, growth, habit, however, they, are, only, distantly, related, to, the, true, lily, lilium, in, the, victorian, language, of, flowers, amaryllis, means, love, beauty, and, determination, and, can, also, represent, hope, and, achievement, amaryllis, is, a, bulbous, plant, with, each, bulb, being, 5, 10, cm, 2, 0, 3, 9, in, in, diameter, it, has, several, strap, shaped, hysteranthous, green, leaves, with, midrib, 30, 50, cm, 12, 20, in, long, and, 2, 3, cm, 0, 79, 1, 18, in, broad, arranged, in, two, rows, each, bulb, produces, one, or, two, leafless, stout, persistent, and, erect, stems, 30, 60, cm, 12, 24, in, tall, each, of, which, bears, at, the, top, a, cluster, of, two, to, twelve, zygomorphic, funnel, shaped, flowers, without, a, tube, each, flower, is, 6, 10, cm, 2, 4, 3, 9, in, in, diameter, with, six, spreading, tepals, three, outer, sepals, three, inner, petals, with, similar, appearance, to, each, other, the, usual, color, is, white, with, crimson, veins, but, pink, or, purple, also, occur, naturally, stamens, are, very, shortly, connate, basally, declinate, unequal, style, is, declinate, stigma, is, three, lobed, ovules, are, approx, 8, per, locule, seeds, are, compressed, globose, white, to, pink, the, number, of, chromosomes, is, 2, n, 22, the, single, genus, is, in, subtribe, amaryllidinae, in, the, tribe, amaryllideae, the, taxonomy, of, the, genus, has, been, controversial, in, 1753, carl, linnaeus, created, the, name, amaryllis, belladonna, the, type, species, of, the, genus, amaryllis, at, the, time, both, south, african, and, south, american, plants, were, placed, in, the, same, genus, subsequently, they, were, separated, into, two, different, genera, the, key, question, is, whether, linnaeus, s, type, was, a, south, african, plant, or, a, south, american, plant, if, the, latter, amaryllis, would, be, the, correct, name, for, the, genus, hippeastrum, and, a, different, name, would, have, to, be, used, for, the, genus, discussed, here, alan, w, meerow, et, al, have, briefly, summarized, the, debate, which, took, place, from, 1938, onwards, and, involved, botanists, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, the, outcome, was, a, decision, by, the, 14th, international, botanical, congress, in, 1987, that, amaryllis, l, should, be, a, conserved, name, i, e, correct, regardless, of, priority, and, ultimately, based, on, a, specimen, of, the, south, african, amaryllis, belladonna, from, the, clifford, herbarium, at, the, natural, history, museum, in, london, as, of, october, 2020, amaryllis, had, only, two, accepted, species, both, native, to, the, cape, provinces, of, south, africa, amaryllidinae, are, placed, within, amaryllideae, as, follow, these, are, phylogenetically, related, as, follows, subtribe, amaryllidinae, subtribe, boophoninae, subtribe, strumariinae, subtribe, crininae, the, name, amaryllis, is, taken, from, a, shepherdess, in, virgil, s, pastoral, eclogues, from, the, greek, amarysso, to, sparkle, although, the, 1987, decision, settled, the, question, of, the, scientific, name, of, the, genus, the, common, name, amaryllis, continues, to, be, used, differently, bulbs, sold, as, amaryllis, and, described, as, ready, to, bloom, for, the, holidays, belong, to, the, allied, genus, hippeastrum, the, common, name, naked, lady, comes, from, the, plant, s, pattern, of, flowering, when, the, foliage, has, died, down, this, name, is, also, used, for, other, bulbs, with, a, similar, growth, and, flowering, pattern, some, of, these, have, their, own, widely, used, and, accepted, common, names, such, as, the, resurrection, lily, lycoris, squamigera, in, areas, of, its, native, habitat, with, mountainous, fynbos, flowering, tends, to, be, suppressed, until, after, bush, fires, as, dense, overhead, vegetation, prevents, growth, in, more, open, sandy, areas, of, the, western, cape, the, plant, flowers, annually, plants, tend, to, be, very, localized, in, dense, concentrations, due, to, the, seeds, large, size, and, heavy, weight, strong, winds, shake, loose, the, seeds, which, fall, to, ground, and, immediately, start, to, germinate, aided, by, the, first, winter, rains, the, leaves, are, produced, in, the, autumn, or, early, spring, in, warm, climates, depending, on, the, onset, of, rain, and, eventually, die, down, by, late, spring, the, bulb, is, then, dormant, until, late, summer, the, plant, is, not, frost, tolerant, nor, does, it, do, well, in, tropical, environments, since, they, require, a, dry, resting, period, between, leaf, growth, and, flower, spike, production, one, or, two, leafless, stems, arise, from, the, bulb, in, the, dry, ground, in, late, summer, march, in, its, native, habitat, and, august, in, usda, zone, 7, the, plant, has, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, carpenter, bees, it, is, also, visited, by, noctuid, moths, at, night, the, relative, importance, of, these, insects, as, pollinators, has, not, yet, been, established, however, carpenter, bees, are, thought, to, be, the, main, pollinators, of, amaryllis, on, the, cape, peninsula, the, plant, s, main, parasite, is, the, lily, borer, brithys, crini, and, or, diaphone, eumela, amaryllis, belladonna, was, introduced, into, cultivation, at, the, beginning, of, the, eighteenth, century, it, reproduces, slowly, by, either, bulb, division, or, seeds, and, has, gradually, naturalized, from, plantings, in, urban, and, suburban, areas, throughout, the, lower, elevations, and, coastal, areas, in, much, of, the, west, coast, of, the, us, since, these, environments, mimic, their, native, south, african, habitat, hardiness, zones, 6, 8, it, is, also, naturalized, in, australia, there, is, an, amaryllis, belladonna, hybrid, which, was, bred, in, the, 1800s, in, australia, no, one, knows, the, exact, species, it, was, crossed, with, to, produce, color, variations, of, white, cream, peach, magenta, and, nearly, red, hues, the, hybrids, were, crossed, back, onto, the, original, amaryllis, belladonna, and, with, each, other, to, produce, naturally, seed, bearing, crosses, that, come, in, a, very, wide, range, of, flower, sizes, shapes, stem, heights, and, intensities, of, pink, pure, white, varieties, with, bright, green, stems, were, bred, as, well, the, hybrids, are, quite, distinct, in, that, the, many, shades, of, pink, also, have, stripes, veining, darkened, edges, white, centers, and, light, yellow, centers, also, setting, them, apart, from, the, original, light, pink, in, addition, the, hybrids, often, produce, flowers, in, a, fuller, circle, rather, than, the, side, facing, habit, of, the, old, fashioned, pink, the, hybrids, are, able, to, adapt, to, year, round, watering, and, fertilization, but, can, also, tolerate, completely, dry, summer, conditions, if, need, be, a, belladonna, has, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, amaryllis, belladonna, has, been, crossed, in, cultivation, with, crinum, moorei, to, produce, a, hybrid, called, amarcrinum, which, has, named, cultivars, hybrids, said, to, be, between, amaryllis, belladonna, and, brunsvigia, josephinae, have, been, called, amarygia, neither, hybrid, genus, name, is, accepted, by, the, world, checklist, of, selected, plant, families
