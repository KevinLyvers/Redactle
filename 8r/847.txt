incertae, sedis, new, world, monkeys, are, the, five, families, of, primates, that, are, found, in, the, tropical, regions, of, mexico, central, and, south, america, callitrichidae, cebidae, aotidae, pitheciidae, and, atelidae, the, five, families, are, ranked, together, as, the, ceboidea, s, b, d, i, the, only, extant, superfamily, in, the, parvorder, platyrrhini, p, l, t, r, a, n, a, platyrrhini, is, derived, from, the, greek, for, broad, nosed, and, their, noses, are, flatter, than, those, of, other, simians, with, sideways, facing, nostrils, monkeys, in, the, family, atelidae, such, as, the, spider, monkey, are, the, only, primates, to, have, prehensile, tails, new, world, monkeys, closest, relatives, are, the, other, simians, the, catarrhini, down, nosed, comprising, old, world, monkeys, and, apes, new, world, monkeys, descend, from, african, simians, that, colonized, south, america, a, line, that, split, off, about, 40, million, years, ago, about, 40, million, years, ago, the, simiiformes, infraorder, split, into, the, parvorders, platyrrhini, new, world, monkeys, and, catarrhini, apes, and, old, world, monkeys, somewhere, on, the, african, continent, platyrrhini, are, currently, conjectured, to, have, dispersed, to, south, america, on, a, raft, of, vegetation, across, the, atlantic, ocean, during, the, eocene, epoch, possibly, via, several, intermediate, now, submerged, islands, several, other, groups, of, animals, made, the, same, journey, across, the, atlantic, notably, including, caviomorph, rodents, at, the, time, the, new, world, monkeys, dispersed, to, south, america, the, isthmus, of, panama, had, not, yet, formed, so, ocean, currents, unlike, today, favoured, westward, dispersal, the, climate, was, quite, different, and, the, width, of, the, atlantic, ocean, was, less, than, the, present, 2, 800, km, 1, 700, mi, width, by, about, a, third, possibly, 1, 000, km, 600, mi, less, based, on, the, current, estimate, of, the, atlantic, mid, ocean, ridge, formation, processes, spreading, rate, of, 25, millimetres, per, year, 1, in, year, the, non, platyrrhini, ucayalipithecus, of, amazonian, peru, who, might, have, rafted, across, the, atlantic, between, 35, 32, million, years, ago, are, nested, within, the, extinct, parapithecoidea, from, the, eocene, of, afro, arabia, suggesting, that, there, were, at, least, two, separate, dispersal, events, of, primates, to, south, america, parvimico, and, perupithecus, from, peru, appear, to, be, at, the, base, of, the, platyrrhini, as, are, szalatavus, lagonimico, and, canaanimico, possible, evidence, for, a, third, transatlantic, dispersal, event, comes, from, a, fossil, molar, belonging, to, ashaninkacebus, simpsoni, which, has, strong, affinities, with, stem, anthropoid, primates, of, south, asian, origin, the, eosimiidae, the, chromosomal, content, of, the, ancestor, species, appears, to, have, been, 2n, 54, in, extant, species, the, 2n, value, varies, from, 16, in, the, titi, monkey, to, 62, in, the, woolly, monkey, a, bayesian, estimate, of, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, the, extant, species, has, a, 95, credible, interval, of, 27, million, years, ago, 31, million, years, ago, the, following, is, the, listing, of, the, various, platyrrhine, families, as, defined, by, rylands, mittermeier, 2009, and, their, position, in, the, order, primates, the, arrangement, of, the, new, world, monkey, families, indeed, the, listing, of, which, groups, consist, of, families, and, which, consist, of, lower, taxonomic, groupings, has, changed, over, the, years, mckenna, bell, 1997, used, two, families, callitrichidae, and, atelidae, with, atelidae, divided, into, cebinae, pitheciinae, and, atelinae, rosenberger, 2002, following, horowitz, 1999, demoted, callitrichidae, to, a, subfamily, putting, it, under, the, newly, raised, cebidae, family, groves, 2005, used, four, families, but, as, a, flat, structure, one, possible, arrangement, of, the, five, families, and, their, subfamilies, of, rylands, mittermeier, can, be, seen, in, silvestro, et, al, 2017, titis, sakis, and, uakaris, howler, monkeys, spider, woolly, spider, and, woolly, monkeys, capuchins, squirrel, monkeys, marmosets, and, lion, tamarins, tamarins, and, saddle, back, tamarins, night, monkeys, new, world, monkeys, are, small, to, mid, sized, primates, ranging, from, the, pygmy, marmoset, the, world, s, smallest, monkey, at, 14, to, 16, cm, 5, 5, to, 6, 5, in, and, a, weight, of, 120, to, 190, g, 4, 2, to, 6, 7, oz, to, the, southern, muriqui, at, 55, to, 70, cm, 22, to, 28, in, and, a, weight, of, 12, to, 15, kg, 26, to, 33, lb, new, world, monkeys, differ, slightly, from, old, world, monkeys, in, several, aspects, the, most, prominent, phenotypic, distinction, is, the, nose, which, is, the, feature, used, most, commonly, to, distinguish, between, the, two, groups, the, clade, for, new, world, monkeys, platyrrhini, means, flat, nosed, the, noses, of, new, world, monkeys, are, flatter, than, the, narrow, noses, of, old, world, monkeys, and, have, side, facing, nostrils, new, world, monkeys, are, the, only, monkeys, with, prehensile, tails, in, comparison, with, the, shorter, non, grasping, tails, of, the, anthropoids, of, the, old, world, prehensility, has, evolved, at, least, two, distinct, times, in, platyrrhines, in, the, atelidae, family, spider, monkeys, woolly, spider, monkeys, howler, monkeys, and, woolly, monkeys, and, in, capuchin, monkeys, cebus, although, prehensility, is, present, in, all, of, these, primate, species, skeletal, and, muscular, based, morphological, differences, between, these, two, groups, indicate, that, the, trait, evolved, separately, through, convergent, evolution, the, fully, prehensile, tails, that, have, evolved, in, atelidae, allow, the, primates, to, suspend, their, entire, body, weight, by, only, their, tails, with, arms, and, legs, free, for, other, foraging, and, locomotive, activities, semi, prehensile, tails, in, cebus, can, be, used, for, balance, by, wrapping, the, tail, around, branches, and, supporting, a, large, portion, of, their, weight, new, world, monkeys, except, for, the, howler, monkeys, of, genus, alouatta, also, typically, lack, the, trichromatic, vision, of, old, world, monkeys, colour, vision, in, new, world, primates, relies, on, a, single, gene, on, the, x, chromosome, to, produce, pigments, that, absorb, medium, and, long, wavelength, light, which, contrasts, with, short, wavelength, light, as, a, result, males, rely, on, a, single, medium, long, pigment, gene, and, are, dichromatic, as, are, homozygous, females, heterozygous, females, may, possess, two, alleles, with, different, sensitivities, within, this, range, and, so, can, display, trichromatic, vision, platyrrhines, also, differ, from, old, world, monkeys, in, that, they, have, twelve, premolars, instead, of, eight, having, a, dental, formula, of, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, or, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, consisting, of, 2, incisors, 1, canine, 3, premolars, and, 2, or, 3, molars, this, is, in, contrast, with, old, world, anthropoids, including, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, siamangs, gibbons, orangutans, and, most, humans, which, share, a, dental, formula, of, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, many, new, world, monkeys, are, small, and, almost, all, are, arboreal, so, knowledge, of, them, is, less, comprehensive, than, that, of, the, more, easily, observed, old, world, monkeys, unlike, most, old, world, monkeys, many, new, world, monkeys, form, monogamous, pair, bonds, and, show, substantial, paternal, care, of, young, they, eat, fruits, nuts, insects, flowers, bird, eggs, spiders, and, small, mammals, unlike, humans, and, most, old, world, monkeys, their, thumbs, are, not, opposable, except, for, some, cebids
