autism, also, called, autism, spectrum, disorder, asd, or, autism, spectrum, condition, asc, is, a, neurodevelopmental, disorder, characterized, by, symptoms, of, deficient, reciprocal, social, communication, and, the, presence, of, restricted, repetitive, and, inflexible, patterns, of, behavior, while, its, severity, and, specific, manifestations, vary, widely, across, the, spectrum, autism, generally, affects, a, person, s, ability, to, understand, and, connect, with, others, as, well, as, their, adaptability, to, everyday, situations, like, most, developmental, disorders, autism, exists, along, a, dimension, of, symptom, severity, subjective, distress, and, functional, impairment, a, consequence, of, this, dimensionality, is, substantial, variability, in, the, nature, and, extent, of, support, a, person, with, asd, requires, a, formal, diagnosis, of, asd, according, to, either, the, dsm, 5, or, the, world, health, organization, s, icd, 11, criteria, requires, not, merely, the, presence, of, asd, symptoms, but, symptoms, that, cause, significant, impairment, in, multiple, domains, of, functioning, in, addition, to, being, excessive, or, atypical, enough, to, be, developmentally, and, socioculturally, inappropriate, common, signs, of, asd, include, difficulty, with, social, interaction, and, verbal, and, nonverbal, communication, along, with, perseverative, interests, stereotypic, body, movements, rigid, routines, and, hyper, or, hypo, reactivity, to, sensory, input, the, dsm, 5, and, icd, 11, classify, autism, as, a, neurodevelopmental, disorder, but, the, autism, rights, movement, and, some, researchers, see, autistic, people, as, part, of, humanity, s, natural, neurodiversity, from, this, point, of, view, autistic, people, may, also, be, diagnosed, with, a, disability, of, some, sort, but, that, disability, may, be, rooted, in, the, systemic, structures, of, a, society, rather, than, in, the, person, thus, proponents, argue, that, autistic, people, should, be, accommodated, rather, than, cured, on, the, contrary, other, scientists, argue, that, many, of, the, impairments, associated, with, asd, are, inherent, to, the, disorder, the, neurodiversity, perspective, has, led, to, significant, controversy, among, those, who, are, autistic, and, advocates, practitioners, and, charities, there, are, many, theories, about, the, causes, of, autism, it, is, highly, heritable, and, mainly, genetic, but, many, genes, are, involved, and, environmental, factors, may, also, be, relevant, the, syndrome, frequently, co, occurs, with, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, epilepsy, and, intellectual, disability, and, research, indicates, that, autistic, people, have, significantly, higher, rates, of, lgbtq, identities, and, feelings, than, the, general, population, disagreements, persist, about, what, should, be, included, as, part, of, the, diagnosis, whether, there, are, meaningful, subtypes, or, stages, of, autism, and, the, significance, of, autism, associated, traits, in, the, wider, population, the, combination, of, broader, criteria, increased, awareness, and, the, potential, increase, of, actual, prevalence, has, led, to, considerably, increased, estimates, of, autism, prevalence, since, the, 1990s, the, world, health, organization, estimates, about, 1, in, 100, children, had, autism, between, 2012, and, 2021, as, that, was, the, average, estimate, in, studies, during, that, period, with, a, trend, of, increasing, prevalence, over, time, this, increasing, prevalence, has, reinforced, the, myth, perpetuated, by, anti, vaccine, activists, that, autism, is, caused, by, vaccines, boys, are, also, significantly, far, more, frequently, diagnosed, than, girls, there, is, no, cure, for, autism, advocates, of, autistic, people, argue, that, efforts, to, find, a, cure, are, misguided, and, even, harmful, early, intervention, services, based, on, applied, behavior, analysis, aba, aim, to, teach, children, self, care, and, normative, social, and, language, skills, some, in, the, autism, rights, movement, consider, aba, therapy, unethical, and, unhelpful, due, to, a, perception, that, it, emphasizes, normalization, instead, of, acceptance, and, its, potential, for, causing, harms, curtailing, self, soothing, behaviors, is, potentially, classifiable, as, a, form, of, abuse, speech, and, occupational, therapy, as, well, as, augmentative, and, alternative, modes, of, communication, are, effective, adjunctive, therapies, pharmacological, treatments, may, also, be, useful, the, atypical, antipsychotics, risperidone, and, aripiprazole, have, shown, to, alleviate, comorbid, irritability, though, they, tend, to, be, associated, with, sedation, and, weight, gain, melatonin, supplementation, has, been, shown, to, improve, insomnia, related, to, autism, spectrum, disorder, stimulant, therapy, may, improve, mental, processing, speed, when, there, is, comorbid, adhd, before, the, dsm, 5, 2013, and, icd, 11, 2022, diagnostic, manuals, were, adopted, asd, was, found, under, the, diagnostic, category, pervasive, developmental, disorder, the, previous, system, relied, on, a, set, of, closely, related, and, overlapping, diagnoses, such, as, asperger, syndrome, and, the, syndrome, formerly, known, as, kanner, syndrome, this, created, unclear, boundaries, between, the, terms, so, for, the, dsm, 5, and, icd, 11, a, spectrum, approach, was, taken, the, new, system, is, also, more, restrictive, meaning, fewer, people, qualify, for, diagnosis, the, dsm, 5, and, icd, 11, use, different, categorization, tools, to, define, this, spectrum, dsm, 5, uses, a, level, system, which, ranks, how, in, need, of, support, the, patient, is, level, 1, being, the, mildest, and, level, 3, the, severest, while, the, icd, 11, system, has, two, axes, intellectual, impairment, and, language, impairment, as, these, are, seen, as, the, most, crucial, factors, autism, is, currently, defined, as, a, highly, variable, neurodevelopmental, disorder, that, is, generally, thought, to, cover, a, broad, and, deep, spectrum, manifesting, very, differently, from, one, person, to, another, some, have, high, support, needs, may, be, non, speaking, and, experience, developmental, delays, this, is, more, likely, with, other, co, existing, diagnoses, others, have, relatively, low, support, needs, they, may, have, more, typical, speech, language, and, intellectual, skills, but, atypical, social, conversation, skills, narrowly, focused, interests, and, wordy, pedantic, communication, they, may, still, require, significant, support, in, some, areas, of, their, lives, the, spectrum, model, should, not, be, understood, as, a, continuum, running, from, mild, to, severe, but, instead, means, that, autism, can, present, very, differently, in, each, person, how, it, presents, in, a, person, can, depend, on, context, and, may, vary, over, time, while, the, dsm, and, icd, greatly, influence, each, other, there, are, also, differences, for, example, rett, syndrome, was, included, in, asd, in, the, dsm, 5, but, in, the, icd, 11, it, was, excluded, and, placed, in, the, chapter, on, developmental, anomalies, the, icd, and, the, dsm, change, over, time, and, there, has, been, collaborative, work, toward, a, convergence, of, the, two, since, 1980, when, dsm, iii, was, published, and, icd, 9, was, current, including, more, rigorous, biological, assessment, in, place, of, historical, experience, and, a, simplification, of, the, classification, system, as, of, 2023, empirical, and, theoretical, research, is, leading, to, a, growing, consensus, among, researchers, that, the, established, asd, criteria, are, ineffective, descriptors, of, autism, as, a, whole, and, that, alternative, research, approaches, must, be, encouraged, such, as, going, back, to, autism, prototypes, exploring, new, causal, models, of, autism, or, developing, transdiagnostic, endophenotypes, proposed, alternatives, to, the, current, disorder, focused, spectrum, model, deconstruct, autism, into, at, least, two, separate, phenomena, 1, a, non, pathological, spectrum, of, behavioral, traits, in, the, population, and, 2, the, neuropathological, burden, of, rare, genetic, mutations, and, environmental, risk, factors, potentially, leading, to, neurodevelopmental, and, psychological, disorders, 3, governed, by, an, individual, s, cognitive, ability, to, compensate, the, world, health, organization, s, international, classification, of, diseases, 11th, revision, icd, 11, was, released, in, june, 2018, and, came, into, full, effect, as, of, january, 2022, it, describes, asd, as, follows, autism, spectrum, disorder, is, characterised, by, persistent, deficits, in, the, ability, to, initiate, and, to, sustain, reciprocal, social, interaction, and, social, communication, and, by, a, range, of, restricted, repetitive, and, inflexible, patterns, of, behaviour, interests, or, activities, that, are, clearly, atypical, or, excessive, for, the, individual, s, age, and, sociocultural, context, the, onset, of, the, disorder, occurs, during, the, developmental, period, typically, in, early, childhood, but, symptoms, may, not, become, fully, manifest, until, later, when, social, demands, exceed, limited, capacities, deficits, are, sufficiently, severe, to, cause, impairment, in, personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or, other, important, areas, of, functioning, and, are, usually, a, pervasive, feature, of, the, individual, s, functioning, observable, in, all, settings, although, they, may, vary, according, to, social, educational, or, other, context, individuals, along, the, spectrum, exhibit, a, full, range, of, intellectual, functioning, and, language, abilities, icd, 11, was, produced, by, professionals, from, 55, countries, out, of, the, 90, involved, and, is, the, most, widely, used, reference, worldwide, the, american, psychiatric, association, s, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, fifth, edition, text, revision, dsm, 5, tr, released, in, 2022, is, the, current, version, of, the, dsm, it, is, the, predominant, mental, health, diagnostic, system, used, in, the, united, states, and, canada, and, is, often, used, in, anglophone, countries, its, fifth, edition, dsm, 5, released, in, may, 2013, was, the, first, to, define, asd, as, a, single, diagnosis, which, is, still, the, case, in, the, dsm, 5, tr, asd, encompasses, previous, diagnoses, including, the, four, traditional, diagnoses, of, autism, classic, autism, asperger, syndrome, childhood, disintegrative, disorder, and, pervasive, developmental, disorder, not, otherwise, specified, pdd, nos, and, the, range, of, diagnoses, that, included, the, word, autism, rather, than, distinguishing, among, these, diagnoses, the, dsm, 5, and, dsm, 5, tr, adopt, a, dimensional, approach, with, one, diagnostic, category, for, disorders, that, fall, under, the, autism, spectrum, umbrella, within, that, category, the, dsm, 5, and, the, dsm, include, a, framework, that, differentiates, each, person, by, dimensions, of, symptom, severity, as, well, as, by, associated, features, i, e, the, presence, of, other, disorders, or, factors, that, likely, contribute, to, the, symptoms, other, neurodevelopmental, or, mental, disorders, intellectual, disability, or, language, impairment, the, symptom, domains, are, a, social, communication, and, b, restricted, repetitive, behaviors, and, there, is, the, option, of, specifying, a, separate, severity, the, negative, effect, of, the, symptoms, on, the, person, for, each, domain, rather, than, just, overall, severity, before, the, dsm, 5, the, dsm, separated, social, deficits, and, communication, deficits, into, two, domains, further, the, dsm, 5, changed, to, an, onset, age, in, the, early, developmental, period, with, a, note, that, symptoms, may, manifest, later, when, social, demands, exceed, capabilities, rather, than, the, previous, more, restricted, three, years, of, age, these, changes, remain, in, the, dsm, 5, tr, for, many, autistic, people, characteristics, first, appear, during, infancy, or, childhood, and, follow, a, steady, course, without, remission, different, developmental, timelines, are, described, in, more, detail, below, autistic, people, may, be, severely, impaired, in, some, respects, but, average, or, even, superior, in, others, clinicians, consider, assessment, for, asd, when, a, patient, shows, these, features, are, typically, assessed, with, the, following, when, appropriate, there, are, many, signs, associated, with, autism, the, presentation, varies, widely, the, broader, autism, phenotype, describes, people, who, may, not, have, asd, but, do, have, autistic, traits, such, as, abnormalities, in, eye, contact, and, stimming, according, to, the, medical, model, autistic, people, experience, social, communications, impairments, until, 2013, deficits, in, social, function, and, communication, were, considered, two, separate, symptom, domains, the, current, social, communication, domain, criteria, for, autism, diagnosis, require, people, to, have, deficits, across, three, social, skills, social, emotional, reciprocity, nonverbal, communication, and, developing, and, sustaining, relationships, a, deficit, based, view, predicts, that, autistic, autistic, interaction, would, be, less, effective, than, autistic, non, autistic, interactions, or, even, non, functional, but, recent, research, has, found, that, autistic, autistic, interactions, are, as, effective, in, information, transfer, as, interactions, between, non, autistics, are, and, that, communication, breaks, down, only, between, autistics, and, non, autistics, also, contrary, to, social, cognitive, deficit, interpretations, recent, 2019, research, recorded, similar, social, cognitive, performances, in, autistic, and, non, autistic, adults, with, both, of, them, rating, autistic, individuals, less, favorably, than, non, autistic, individuals, however, autistic, individuals, showed, more, interest, in, engaging, with, autistic, people, than, non, autistic, people, did, and, learning, of, a, person, s, asd, diagnosis, did, not, influence, their, interest, level, thus, there, has, been, a, recent, shift, to, acknowledge, that, autistic, people, may, simply, respond, and, behave, differently, than, people, without, asd, so, far, research, has, identified, two, unconventional, features, by, which, autistic, people, create, shared, understanding, intersubjectivity, a, generous, assumption, of, common, ground, that, when, understood, led, to, rapid, rapport, and, when, not, understood, resulted, in, potentially, disruptive, utterances, and, a, low, demand, for, coordination, that, ameliorated, many, challenges, associated, with, disruptive, turns, autistic, interests, and, thus, conversational, topics, seem, to, be, largely, driven, by, an, intense, interest, in, specific, topics, monotropism, historically, autistic, children, were, said, to, be, delayed, in, developing, a, theory, of, mind, and, the, empathizing, systemizing, theory, has, argued, that, while, autistic, people, have, compassion, affective, empathy, for, others, with, similar, presentation, of, symptoms, they, have, limited, though, not, necessarily, absent, cognitive, empathy, this, may, present, as, social, na, vety, lower, than, average, intuitive, perception, of, the, utility, or, meaning, of, body, language, social, reciprocity, and, or, social, expectations, including, the, habitus, social, cues, and, or, some, aspects, of, sarcasm, which, to, some, degree, may, also, be, due, to, comorbid, alexithymia, but, recent, research, has, increasingly, questioned, these, findings, as, the, double, empathy, problem, theory, 2012, argues, that, there, is, a, lack, of, mutual, understanding, and, empathy, between, both, non, autistic, persons, and, autistic, individuals, as, communication, is, bidirectional, research, on, communication, difficulties, has, since, also, begun, to, study, non, autistic, behavior, with, researcher, catherine, crompton, writing, in, 2020, that, non, autistic, people, struggle, to, identify, autistic, mental, states, identify, autistic, facial, expressions, overestimate, autistic, egocentricity, and, are, less, willing, to, socially, interact, with, autistic, people, thus, although, non, autistic, people, are, generally, characterised, as, socially, skilled, these, skills, may, not, be, functional, or, effectively, applied, when, interacting, with, autistic, people, any, previously, observed, communication, deficits, of, autistic, people, may, thus, have, been, constructed, through, a, neurotypical, bias, in, autism, research, which, has, come, to, be, scrutinized, for, dehumanization, objectification, and, stigmatization, recent, research, has, proposed, that, autistics, lack, of, readability, and, a, neurotypical, lack, of, effort, to, interpret, atypical, signals, may, cause, a, negative, interaction, loop, increasingly, driving, both, groups, apart, into, two, distinct, groups, with, different, social, interaction, styles, differences, in, verbal, communication, begin, to, be, noticeable, in, childhood, as, many, autistic, children, develop, language, skills, at, an, uneven, pace, verbal, communication, may, be, delayed, or, never, develop, nonverbal, autism, while, reading, ability, may, be, present, before, school, age, hyperlexia, reduced, joint, attention, seem, to, distinguish, autistic, from, non, autistic, infants, infants, may, show, delayed, onset, of, babbling, unusual, gestures, diminished, responsiveness, and, vocal, patterns, that, are, not, synchronized, with, the, caregiver, in, the, second, and, third, years, autistic, children, may, have, less, frequent, and, less, diverse, babbling, consonants, words, and, word, combinations, their, gestures, are, less, often, integrated, with, words, autistic, children, are, less, likely, to, make, requests, or, share, experiences, and, more, likely, to, simply, repeat, others, words, echolalia, the, cdc, estimated, in, 2015, that, around, 40, of, autistic, children, do, not, speak, at, all, autistic, adults, verbal, communication, skills, largely, depend, on, when, and, how, well, speech, is, acquired, during, childhood, autistic, people, display, atypical, nonverbal, behaviors, or, show, differences, in, nonverbal, communication, they, may, make, infrequent, eye, contact, even, when, called, by, name, or, avoid, it, altogether, this, may, be, due, to, the, high, amount, of, sensory, input, received, when, making, eye, contact, autistic, people, often, recognize, fewer, emotions, and, their, meaning, from, others, facial, expressions, and, may, not, respond, with, facial, expressions, expected, by, their, non, autistic, peers, temple, grandin, an, autistic, woman, involved, in, autism, activism, described, her, inability, to, understand, neurotypicals, social, communication, as, leaving, her, feeling, like, an, anthropologist, on, mars, autistic, people, struggle, to, understand, the, social, context, and, subtext, of, neurotypical, conversational, or, printed, situations, and, form, different, conclusions, about, the, content, autistic, people, may, not, control, the, volume, of, their, voice, in, different, social, settings, at, least, half, of, autistic, children, have, atypical, prosody, what, may, look, like, self, involvement, or, indifference, to, non, autistic, people, stems, from, autistic, differences, in, recognizing, how, other, people, have, their, own, personalities, perspectives, and, interests, most, published, research, focuses, on, the, interpersonal, relationship, difficulties, between, autistic, people, and, their, non, autistic, counterparts, and, how, to, solve, them, through, teaching, neurotypical, social, skills, but, newer, research, has, also, evaluated, what, autistic, people, want, from, friendships, such, as, a, sense, of, belonging, and, good, mental, health, children, with, asd, are, more, frequently, involved, in, bullying, situations, than, their, non, autistic, peers, and, predominantly, experience, bullying, as, victims, rather, than, perpetrators, or, victim, perpetrators, especially, after, controlling, for, comorbid, psychopathology, prioritizing, dependability, and, intimacy, in, friendships, during, adolescence, coupled, with, lowered, friendship, quantity, and, quality, often, lead, to, increased, loneliness, in, autistic, people, as, they, progress, through, life, autistic, people, observe, and, form, a, model, of, social, patterns, and, develop, coping, mechanisms, referred, to, as, masking, which, have, recently, been, found, to, come, with, psychological, costs, and, a, higher, increased, risk, of, suicidality, asd, includes, a, wide, variety, of, characteristics, some, of, these, include, behavioral, characteristics, which, widely, range, from, slow, development, of, social, and, learning, skills, to, difficulties, creating, connections, with, other, people, autistic, people, may, experience, these, challenges, with, forming, connections, due, to, anxiety, or, depression, which, they, are, more, likely, to, experience, and, as, a, result, isolate, themselves, other, behavioral, characteristics, include, abnormal, responses, to, sensations, such, as, sights, sounds, touch, taste, and, smell, and, problems, keeping, a, consistent, speech, rhythm, the, latter, problem, influences, social, skills, leading, to, potential, problems, in, understanding, for, interlocutors, autistic, people, s, behavioral, characteristics, typically, influence, development, language, and, social, competence, their, behavioral, characteristics, can, be, observed, as, perceptual, disturbances, disturbances, of, development, rate, relating, speech, and, language, and, motility, the, second, core, symptom, of, autism, spectrum, is, a, pattern, of, restricted, and, repetitive, behaviors, activities, and, interests, in, order, to, be, diagnosed, with, asd, under, the, dsm, 5, tr, a, person, must, have, at, least, two, of, the, following, behaviors, autistic, people, can, display, many, forms, of, repetitive, or, restricted, behavior, which, the, repetitive, behavior, scale, revised, rbs, r, categorizes, as, follows, self, injurious, behaviors, are, relatively, common, in, autistic, people, and, can, include, head, banging, self, cutting, self, biting, and, hair, pulling, some, of, these, can, result, in, serious, injury, or, death, following, are, theories, about, the, cause, of, self, injurious, behavior, in, children, with, developmental, delay, including, autistic, children, the, suicide, rate, for, verbal, autistics, is, nine, times, that, of, the, general, population, studies, have, supported, the, common, belief, that, autistic, people, become, exhausted, or, burnt, out, in, some, situations, autistic, people, may, have, symptoms, that, do, not, contribute, to, the, official, diagnosis, but, that, can, affect, the, person, or, the, family, in, september, 2018, the, review, journal, of, autism, and, developmental, disorders, published, a, systematic, review, of, 47, studies, published, from, 2005, to, 2016, that, concluded, that, associations, between, autism, spectrum, disorder, asd, and, screen, time, was, inconclusive, in, may, 2019, the, journal, of, developmental, and, behavioral, pediatrics, published, a, systematic, review, of, 16, studies, that, found, that, children, and, adolescents, with, asd, are, exposed, to, more, screen, time, than, typically, developing, peers, and, that, the, exposure, starts, at, a, younger, age, in, april, 2021, research, in, autism, spectrum, disorders, published, a, systematic, review, of, 12, studies, of, video, game, addiction, in, asd, subjects, that, found, that, children, adolescents, and, adults, with, asd, are, at, greater, risk, of, video, game, addiction, than, those, without, asd, and, that, the, data, from, the, studies, suggested, that, internal, and, external, factors, sex, attention, and, oppositional, behavior, problems, social, aspects, access, and, time, spent, playing, video, games, parental, rules, and, game, genre, were, significant, predictors, of, video, game, addiction, in, asd, subjects, in, march, 2022, the, review, journal, of, autism, and, developmental, disorders, published, a, systematic, review, of, 21, studies, investigating, associations, between, asd, problematic, internet, use, and, gaming, disorder, where, the, majority, of, the, studies, found, positive, associations, between, the, disorders, exactly, what, causes, autism, remains, unknown, it, was, long, mostly, presumed, that, there, is, a, common, cause, at, the, genetic, cognitive, and, neural, levels, for, the, social, and, non, social, components, of, asd, s, symptoms, described, as, a, triad, in, the, classic, autism, criteria, but, it, is, increasingly, suspected, that, autism, is, instead, a, complex, disorder, whose, core, aspects, have, distinct, causes, that, often, cooccur, it, is, unlikely, that, asd, has, a, single, cause, many, risk, factors, identified, in, the, research, literature, may, contribute, to, asd, these, include, genetics, prenatal, and, perinatal, factors, meaning, factors, during, pregnancy, or, very, early, infancy, neuroanatomical, abnormalities, and, environmental, factors, it, is, possible, to, identify, general, factors, but, much, more, difficult, to, pinpoint, specific, ones, given, the, current, state, of, knowledge, prediction, can, only, be, of, a, global, nature, and, so, requires, the, use, of, general, markers, research, into, causes, has, been, hampered, by, the, inability, to, identify, biologically, meaningful, subgroups, within, the, autistic, population, and, by, the, traditional, boundaries, between, the, disciplines, of, psychiatry, psychology, neurology, and, pediatrics, newer, technologies, such, as, fmri, and, diffusion, tensor, imaging, can, help, identify, biologically, relevant, phenotypes, observable, traits, that, can, be, viewed, on, brain, scans, to, help, further, neurogenetic, studies, of, autism, one, example, is, lowered, activity, in, the, fusiform, face, area, of, the, brain, which, is, associated, with, impaired, perception, of, people, versus, objects, it, has, been, proposed, to, classify, autism, using, genetics, as, well, as, behavior, autism, spectrum, disorder, asd, can, be, classified, into, two, categories, syndromic, autism, and, non, syndromic, autism, syndromic, autism, refers, to, cases, where, asd, is, one, of, the, characteristics, associated, with, a, broader, medical, condition, or, syndrome, representing, about, 25, of, asd, cases, the, causes, of, syndromic, autism, are, often, known, and, monogenic, disorders, account, for, approximately, 5, of, these, cases, non, syndromic, autism, also, known, as, classic, or, idiopathic, autism, represents, the, majority, of, cases, and, its, cause, is, typically, polygenic, and, unknown, autism, has, a, strong, genetic, basis, although, the, genetics, of, autism, are, complex, and, it, is, unclear, whether, asd, is, explained, more, by, rare, mutations, with, major, effects, or, by, rare, multi, gene, interactions, of, common, genetic, variants, complexity, arises, due, to, interactions, among, multiple, genes, the, environment, and, epigenetic, factors, which, do, not, change, dna, sequencing, but, are, heritable, and, influence, gene, expression, many, genes, have, been, associated, with, autism, through, sequencing, the, genomes, of, affected, people, and, their, parents, but, most, of, the, mutations, that, increase, autism, risk, have, not, been, identified, typically, autism, cannot, be, traced, to, a, mendelian, single, gene, mutation, or, to, a, single, chromosome, abnormality, and, none, of, the, genetic, syndromes, associated, with, asd, have, been, shown, to, selectively, cause, asd, numerous, genes, have, been, found, with, only, small, effects, attributable, to, any, particular, gene, most, loci, individually, explain, less, than, 1, of, cases, of, autism, as, of, 2018, it, appeared, that, between, 74, and, 93, of, asd, risk, is, heritable, after, an, older, child, is, diagnosed, with, asd, 7, to, 20, of, subsequent, children, are, likely, to, be, as, well, if, parents, have, one, autistic, child, they, have, a, 2, to, 8, chance, of, having, a, second, child, who, is, autistic, if, the, autistic, child, is, an, identical, twin, the, other, will, be, affected, 36, to, 95, of, the, time, a, fraternal, twin, is, affected, up, to, 31, of, the, time, the, large, number, of, autistic, people, with, unaffected, family, members, may, result, from, spontaneous, structural, variation, such, as, deletions, duplications, or, inversions, in, genetic, material, during, meiosis, hence, a, substantial, fraction, of, autism, cases, may, be, traceable, to, genetic, causes, that, are, highly, heritable, but, not, inherited, that, is, the, mutation, that, causes, the, autism, is, not, present, in, the, parental, genome, as, of, 2018, understanding, of, genetic, risk, factors, had, shifted, from, a, focus, on, a, few, alleles, to, an, understanding, that, genetic, involvement, in, asd, is, probably, diffuse, depending, on, a, large, number, of, variants, some, of, which, are, common, and, have, a, small, effect, and, some, of, which, are, rare, and, have, a, large, effect, the, most, common, gene, disrupted, with, large, effect, rare, variants, appeared, to, be, chd8, but, less, than, 0, 5, of, autistic, people, have, such, a, mutation, the, gene, chd8, encodes, the, protein, chromodomain, helicase, dna, binding, protein, 8, which, is, a, chromatin, regulator, enzyme, that, is, essential, during, fetal, development, chd8, is, an, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, dependent, enzyme, the, protein, contains, an, snf2, helicase, domain, that, is, responsible, for, the, hydrolysis, of, atp, to, adenosine, diphosphate, adp, chd8, encodes, a, dna, helicase, that, functions, as, a, repressor, of, transcription, remodeling, chromatin, structure, by, altering, the, position, of, nucleosomes, chd8, negatively, regulates, wnt, signaling, wnt, signaling, is, important, in, the, vertebrate, early, development, and, morphogenesis, it, is, believed, that, chd8, also, recruits, the, linker, histone, h1, and, causes, the, repression, of, catenin, and, p53, target, genes, the, importance, of, chd8, can, be, observed, in, studies, where, chd8, knockout, mice, died, after, 5, 5, embryonic, days, because, of, widespread, p53, induced, apoptosis, some, studies, have, determined, the, role, of, chd8, in, autism, spectrum, disorder, asd, chd8, expression, significantly, increases, during, human, mid, fetal, development, the, chromatin, remodeling, activity, and, its, interaction, with, transcriptional, regulators, have, shown, to, play, an, important, role, in, asd, aetiology, the, developing, mammalian, brain, has, conserved, chd8, target, regions, that, are, associated, with, asd, risk, genes, the, knockdown, of, chd8, in, human, neural, stem, cells, results, in, dysregulation, of, asd, risk, genes, that, are, targeted, by, chd8, recently, chd8, has, been, associated, with, the, regulation, of, long, non, coding, rnas, lncrnas, and, the, regulation, of, x, chromosome, inactivation, xci, initiation, via, regulation, of, xist, long, non, coding, rna, the, master, regulator, of, xci, though, competitive, binding, to, xist, regulatory, regions, some, asd, is, associated, with, clearly, genetic, conditions, like, fragile, x, syndrome, but, only, around, 2, of, autistic, people, have, fragile, x, hypotheses, from, evolutionary, psychiatry, suggest, that, these, genes, persist, because, they, are, linked, to, human, inventiveness, intelligence, or, systemising, current, research, suggests, that, genes, that, increase, susceptibility, to, asd, are, ones, that, control, protein, synthesis, in, neuronal, cells, in, response, to, cell, needs, activity, and, adhesion, of, neuronal, cells, synapse, formation, and, remodeling, and, excitatory, to, inhibitory, neurotransmitter, balance, therefore, although, up, to, 1, 000, different, genes, are, thought, to, increase, the, risk, of, asd, all, of, them, eventually, affect, normal, neural, development, and, connectivity, between, different, functional, areas, of, the, brain, in, a, similar, manner, that, is, characteristic, of, an, asd, brain, some, of, these, genes, are, known, to, modulate, production, of, the, gaba, neurotransmitter, the, nervous, system, s, main, inhibitory, neurotransmitter, these, gaba, related, genes, are, under, expressed, in, an, asd, brain, on, the, other, hand, genes, controlling, expression, of, glial, and, immune, cells, in, the, brain, e, g, astrocytes, and, microglia, respectively, are, over, expressed, which, correlates, with, increased, number, of, glial, and, immune, cells, found, in, postmortem, asd, brains, some, genes, under, investigation, in, asd, pathophysiology, are, those, that, affect, the, mtor, signaling, pathway, which, supports, cell, growth, and, survival, all, these, genetic, variants, contribute, to, the, development, of, the, autism, spectrum, but, it, cannot, be, guaranteed, that, they, are, determinants, for, the, development, asd, may, be, under, diagnosed, in, women, and, girls, due, to, an, assumption, that, it, is, primarily, a, male, condition, but, genetic, phenomena, such, as, imprinting, and, x, linkage, have, the, ability, to, raise, the, frequency, and, severity, of, conditions, in, males, and, theories, have, been, put, forward, for, a, genetic, reason, why, males, are, diagnosed, more, often, such, as, the, imprinted, brain, hypothesis, and, the, extreme, male, brain, theory, several, prenatal, and, perinatal, complications, have, been, reported, as, possible, risk, factors, for, autism, these, risk, factors, include, maternal, gestational, diabetes, maternal, and, paternal, age, over, 30, bleeding, during, pregnancy, after, the, first, trimester, use, of, certain, prescription, medication, e, g, valproate, during, pregnancy, and, meconium, in, the, amniotic, fluid, research, is, not, conclusive, on, the, relation, of, these, factors, to, autism, but, each, of, them, has, been, identified, more, frequently, in, children, with, autism, compared, to, their, siblings, who, do, not, have, autism, and, other, typically, developing, youth, while, it, is, unclear, if, any, single, factors, during, the, prenatal, phase, affect, the, risk, of, autism, complications, during, pregnancy, may, be, a, risk, there, are, also, studies, being, done, to, test, whether, certain, types, of, regressive, autism, have, an, autoimmune, basis, maternal, nutrition, and, inflammation, during, preconception, and, pregnancy, influences, fetal, neurodevelopment, intrauterine, growth, restriction, is, associated, with, asd, in, both, term, and, preterm, infants, maternal, inflammatory, and, autoimmune, diseases, may, damage, fetal, tissues, aggravating, a, genetic, problem, or, damaging, the, nervous, system, systematic, reviews, and, meta, analyses, have, found, that, maternal, prenatal, infections, prenatal, antibiotic, exposure, and, post, term, pregnancies, are, associated, with, increased, risk, of, asd, in, children, exposure, to, air, pollution, during, child, pregnancy, especially, heavy, metals, and, particulates, may, increase, the, risk, of, autism, environmental, factors, that, have, been, claimed, without, evidence, to, contribute, to, or, exacerbate, autism, include, certain, foods, infectious, diseases, solvents, pcbs, phthalates, and, phenols, used, in, plastic, products, pesticides, brominated, flame, retardants, alcohol, smoking, illicit, drugs, vaccines, and, prenatal, stress, some, such, as, the, mmr, vaccine, have, been, completely, disproven, parents, may, first, become, aware, of, asd, symptoms, in, their, child, around, the, time, of, a, routine, vaccination, this, has, led, to, unsupported, and, disproven, theories, blaming, vaccine, overload, the, vaccine, preservative, thiomersal, or, the, mmr, vaccine, for, causing, autism, spectrum, disorder, in, 1998, british, physician, and, academic, andrew, wakefield, led, a, fraudulent, litigation, funded, study, that, suggested, that, the, mmr, vaccine, may, cause, autism, two, versions, of, the, vaccine, causation, hypothesis, were, that, autism, results, from, brain, damage, caused, by, either, the, mmr, vaccine, itself, or, by, mercury, used, as, a, vaccine, preservative, no, convincing, scientific, evidence, supports, these, claims, they, are, biologically, implausible, and, further, evidence, continues, to, refute, them, including, the, observation, that, the, rate, of, autism, continues, to, climb, despite, elimination, of, thimerosal, from, most, routine, vaccines, given, to, children, from, birth, to, 6, years, of, age, a, 2014, meta, analysis, examined, ten, major, studies, on, autism, and, vaccines, involving, 1, 25, million, children, worldwide, it, concluded, that, neither, the, vaccine, preservative, thimerosal, mercury, nor, the, mmr, vaccine, which, has, never, contained, thimerosal, lead, to, the, development, of, asds, despite, this, misplaced, parental, concern, has, led, to, lower, rates, of, childhood, immunizations, outbreaks, of, previously, controlled, childhood, diseases, in, some, countries, and, the, preventable, deaths, of, several, children, several, hypotheses, have, been, presented, that, try, to, explain, how, and, why, autism, develops, by, integrating, known, causes, genetic, and, environmental, effects, and, findings, neurobiological, and, somatic, some, are, more, comprehensive, such, as, the, pathogenetic, triad, which, proposes, and, operationalizes, three, core, features, an, autistic, personality, cognitive, compensation, neuropathological, burden, that, interact, to, cause, autism, and, the, intense, world, theory, which, explains, autism, through, a, hyper, active, neurobiology, that, leads, to, an, increased, perception, attention, memory, and, emotionality, there, are, also, simpler, hypotheses, that, explain, only, individual, parts, of, the, neurobiology, or, phenotype, of, autism, such, as, mind, blindness, a, decreased, ability, for, theory, of, mind, the, weak, central, coherence, theory, or, the, extreme, male, brain, and, empathising, systemising, theory, research, exploring, the, evolutionary, benefits, of, autism, and, associated, genes, has, suggested, that, autistic, people, may, have, played, a, unique, role, in, technological, spheres, and, understanding, of, natural, systems, in, the, course, of, human, development, it, has, been, suggested, that, autism, may, have, arisen, as, a, slight, trade, off, for, other, traits, that, are, seen, as, highly, advantageous, providing, advantages, in, tool, making, and, mechanical, thinking, with, speculation, that, the, condition, may, reveal, itself, to, be, the, result, of, a, balanced, polymorphism, like, sickle, cell, anemia, that, is, advantageous, in, a, certain, mixture, of, genes, and, disadvantageous, in, specific, combinations, in, 2011, a, paper, in, evolutionary, psychology, proposed, that, autistic, traits, including, increased, spatial, intelligence, concentration, and, memory, could, have, been, naturally, selected, to, enable, self, sufficient, foraging, in, a, more, although, not, completely, solitary, environment, this, is, called, the, solitary, forager, hypothesis, a, 2016, paper, examines, asperger, syndrome, as, an, alternative, prosocial, adaptive, strategy, that, may, have, developed, as, a, result, of, the, emergence, of, collaborative, morality, in, the, context, of, small, scale, hunter, gathering, i, e, where, a, positive, social, reputation, for, making, a, contribution, to, group, wellbeing, and, survival, becomes, more, important, than, complex, social, understanding, some, multidisciplinary, research, suggests, that, recent, human, evolution, may, be, a, driving, force, in, the, rise, of, a, number, of, medical, conditions, including, autism, in, recent, human, populations, studies, in, evolutionary, medicine, indicate, that, as, cultural, evolution, outpaces, biological, evolution, disorders, linked, to, bodily, dysfunction, increase, in, prevalence, due, to, lack, of, contact, with, pathogens, and, negative, environmental, conditions, that, once, widely, affected, ancestral, populations, because, natural, selection, favors, reproduction, over, health, and, longevity, the, lack, of, this, impetus, to, adapt, to, certain, harmful, circumstances, creates, a, tendency, for, genes, in, descendant, populations, to, over, express, themselves, which, may, cause, a, wide, array, of, maladies, ranging, from, mental, disorders, to, autoimmune, diseases, conversely, noting, the, failure, to, find, specific, alleles, that, reliably, cause, autism, or, rare, mutations, that, account, for, more, than, 5, of, the, heritable, variation, in, autism, established, by, twin, and, adoption, studies, research, in, evolutionary, psychiatry, has, concluded, that, it, is, unlikely, that, there, is, selection, pressure, for, autism, when, considering, that, like, schizophrenics, autistic, people, and, their, siblings, tend, to, have, fewer, offspring, on, average, than, non, autistic, people, and, instead, that, autism, is, probably, better, explained, as, a, by, product, of, adaptive, traits, caused, by, antagonistic, pleiotropy, and, by, genes, that, are, retained, due, to, a, fitness, landscape, with, an, asymmetric, distribution, autism, is, correlated, or, comorbid, with, several, personality, traits, disorders, comorbidity, may, increase, with, age, and, may, worsen, the, course, of, youth, with, asds, and, make, intervention, and, treatment, more, difficult, distinguishing, between, asds, and, other, diagnoses, can, be, challenging, because, the, traits, of, asds, often, overlap, with, symptoms, of, other, disorders, and, the, characteristics, of, asds, make, traditional, diagnostic, procedures, difficult, research, indicates, that, autistic, people, are, significantly, more, likely, to, be, lgbt, than, the, general, population, there, is, tentative, evidence, that, gender, dysphoria, occurs, more, frequently, in, autistic, people, a, 2021, anonymized, online, survey, of, 16, to, 90, year, olds, revealed, that, autistic, males, are, more, likely, to, identify, as, bisexual, than, their, non, autistic, peers, while, autistic, females, are, more, likely, to, identify, as, homosexual, than, non, autistic, females, do, people, on, the, autism, spectrum, are, significantly, more, likely, to, be, non, theistic, than, members, of, the, general, population, there, is, no, treatment, as, such, for, autism, and, many, sources, advise, that, this, is, not, an, appropriate, goal, although, treatment, of, co, occurring, conditions, remains, an, important, goal, there, is, no, cure, for, autism, as, of, 2024, nor, can, any, of, the, known, treatments, significantly, reduce, brain, mutations, caused, by, autism, although, those, who, require, little, to, no, support, are, more, likely, to, experience, a, lessening, of, symptoms, over, time, several, interventions, can, help, children, with, autism, and, no, single, treatment, is, best, with, treatment, typically, tailored, to, the, child, s, needs, studies, of, interventions, have, methodological, problems, that, prevent, definitive, conclusions, about, efficacy, but, the, development, of, evidence, based, interventions, has, advanced, the, main, goals, of, treatment, are, to, lessen, associated, deficits, and, family, distress, and, to, increase, quality, of, life, and, functional, independence, in, general, higher, iqs, are, correlated, with, greater, responsiveness, to, treatment, and, improved, treatment, outcomes, behavioral, psychological, education, and, or, skill, building, interventions, may, be, used, to, assist, autistic, people, to, learn, life, skills, necessary, for, living, independently, as, well, as, other, social, communication, and, language, skills, therapy, also, aims, to, reduce, challenging, behaviors, and, build, upon, strengths, intensive, sustained, special, education, programs, and, behavior, therapy, early, in, life, may, help, children, acquire, self, care, language, and, job, skills, although, evidence, based, interventions, for, autistic, children, vary, in, their, methods, many, adopt, a, psychoeducational, approach, to, enhancing, cognitive, communication, and, social, skills, while, minimizing, problem, behaviors, while, medications, have, not, been, found, to, help, with, core, symptoms, they, may, be, used, for, associated, symptoms, such, as, irritability, inattention, or, repetitive, behavior, patterns, intensive, sustained, special, education, or, remedial, education, programs, and, behavior, therapy, early, in, life, may, help, children, acquire, self, care, social, and, job, skills, available, approaches, include, applied, behavior, analysis, developmental, models, structured, teaching, speech, and, language, therapy, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, social, skills, therapy, and, occupational, therapy, among, these, approaches, interventions, either, treat, autistic, features, comprehensively, or, focus, treatment, on, a, specific, area, of, deficit, generally, when, educating, those, with, autism, specific, tactics, may, be, used, to, effectively, relay, information, to, these, people, using, as, much, social, interaction, as, possible, is, key, in, targeting, the, inhibition, autistic, people, experience, concerning, person, to, person, contact, additionally, research, has, shown, that, employing, semantic, groupings, which, involves, assigning, words, to, typical, conceptual, categories, can, be, beneficial, in, fostering, learning, there, has, been, increasing, attention, to, the, development, of, evidence, based, interventions, for, autistic, young, children, three, theoretical, frameworks, outlined, for, early, childhood, intervention, include, applied, behavior, analysis, aba, the, developmental, social, pragmatic, model, dsp, and, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, although, aba, therapy, has, a, strong, evidence, base, particularly, in, regard, to, early, intensive, home, based, therapy, aba, s, effectiveness, may, be, limited, by, diagnostic, severity, and, iq, of, the, person, affected, by, asd, the, journal, of, clinical, child, and, adolescent, psychology, has, published, a, paper, deeming, two, early, childhood, interventions, well, established, individual, comprehensive, aba, and, focused, teacher, implemented, aba, combined, with, dsp, many, people, including, autistic, adults, have, criticized, aba, calling, it, unhelpful, unethical, and, even, abuse, autistic, scholar, nick, walker, who, experienced, aba, as, a, child, has, said, that, through, aba, autistic, children, are, abused, coerced, and, traumatized, into, imitating, the, outward, behavior, of, neurotypical, children, at, the, expense, of, their, long, term, psychological, well, being, sandoval, norton, et, al, also, discuss, the, unintended, but, damaging, consequences, such, as, prompt, dependency, psychological, abuse, and, compliance, that, result, in, autistic, people, facing, challenges, as, they, transition, into, adulthood, some, aba, advocates, have, responded, to, such, critiques, that, instead, of, stopping, aba, there, should, be, movement, to, increase, protections, and, ethical, compliance, when, working, with, autistic, children, another, evidence, based, intervention, that, has, demonstrated, efficacy, is, a, parent, training, model, which, teaches, parents, how, to, implement, various, aba, and, dsp, techniques, themselves, various, dsp, programs, have, been, developed, to, explicitly, deliver, intervention, systems, through, at, home, parent, implementation, in, october, 2015, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, aap, proposed, new, evidence, based, recommendations, for, early, interventions, in, asd, for, children, under, 3, these, recommendations, emphasize, early, involvement, with, both, developmental, and, behavioral, methods, support, by, and, for, parents, and, caregivers, and, a, focus, on, both, the, core, and, associated, symptoms, of, asd, but, a, cochrane, review, found, no, evidence, that, early, intensive, behavioral, intervention, eibi, is, effective, in, reducing, behavioral, problems, associated, with, autism, in, most, autistic, children, though, it, did, improve, iq, and, language, skills, the, cochrane, review, acknowledged, that, this, may, be, due, to, the, low, quality, of, studies, available, on, eibi, and, therefore, providers, should, recommend, eibi, based, on, their, clinical, judgment, and, the, family, s, preferences, no, adverse, effects, of, eibi, treatment, were, found, a, meta, analysis, in, that, same, database, indicates, that, due, to, the, heterology, in, asd, children, progress, to, differing, early, intervention, modalities, based, on, aba, asd, treatment, generally, focuses, on, behavioral, and, educational, interventions, to, target, its, two, core, symptoms, social, communication, deficits, and, restricted, repetitive, behaviors, if, symptoms, continue, after, behavioral, strategies, have, been, implemented, some, medications, can, be, recommended, to, target, specific, symptoms, or, co, existing, problems, such, as, restricted, and, repetitive, behaviors, rrbs, anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, inattention, and, sleep, disturbance, melatonin, for, example, can, be, used, for, sleep, problems, several, parent, mediated, behavioral, therapies, target, social, communication, deficits, in, children, with, autism, but, their, efficacy, in, treating, rrbs, is, uncertain, educational, interventions, often, used, include, applied, behavior, analysis, aba, developmental, models, structured, teaching, speech, and, language, therapy, and, social, skills, therapy, among, these, approaches, interventions, either,

the, recent, development, of, parent, training, models, these, interventions, have, demonstrated, effectiveness, in, numerous, studies, being, evaluated, as, a, probable, efficacious, mode, of, treatment, early, intensive, aba, therapy, has, demonstrated, effectiveness, in, enhancing, communication, and, adaptive, functioning, in, preschool, children, it, is, also, well, established, for, improving, the, intellectual, performance, of, that, age, group, in, 2018, a, cochrane, meta, analysis, database, concluded, that, some, recent, research, is, beginning, to, suggest, that, because, of, the, heterology, of, asd, there, are, two, different, aba, teaching, approaches, to, acquiring, spoken, language, children, with, higher, receptive, language, skills, respond, to, 2, 5, to, 20, hours, per, week, of, the, naturalistic, approach, whereas, children, with, lower, receptive, language, skills, require, 25, hours, per, week, of, discrete, trial, training, the, structured, and, intensive, form, of, aba, a, 2023, randomized, control, trial, study, of, 164, participants, showed, similar, findings, similarly, a, teacher, implemented, intervention, that, utilizes, a, more, naturalistic, form, of, aba, combined, with, a, developmental, social, pragmatic, approach, has, been, found, to, be, beneficial, in, improving, social, communication, skills, in, young, children, although, there, is, less, evidence, in, its, treatment, of, global, symptoms, neuropsychological, reports, are, often, poorly, communicated, to, educators, resulting, in, a, gap, between, what, a, report, recommends, and, what, education, is, provided, the, appropriateness, of, including, children, with, varying, severity, of, autism, spectrum, disorders, in, the, general, education, population, is, a, subject, of, current, debate, among, educators, and, researchers, medications, may, be, used, to, treat, asd, symptoms, that, interfere, with, integrating, a, child, into, home, or, school, when, behavioral, treatment, fails, they, may, also, be, used, for, associated, health, problems, such, as, adhd, anxiety, or, if, the, person, is, hurting, themself, or, aggressive, with, others, but, their, routine, prescription, for, asd, s, core, features, is, not, recommended, more, than, half, of, us, children, diagnosed, with, asd, are, prescribed, psychoactive, drugs, or, anticonvulsants, with, the, most, common, drug, classes, being, antidepressants, stimulants, and, antipsychotics, the, atypical, antipsychotic, drugs, risperidone, and, aripiprazole, are, fda, approved, for, treating, associated, aggressive, and, self, injurious, behaviors, but, their, side, effects, must, be, weighed, against, their, potential, benefits, and, autistic, people, may, respond, atypically, side, effects, may, include, weight, gain, tiredness, drooling, and, aggression, some, emerging, data, show, positive, effects, of, aripiprazole, and, risperidone, on, restricted, and, repetitive, behaviors, i, e, stimming, e, g, flapping, twisting, complex, whole, body, movements, but, due, to, the, small, sample, size, and, different, focus, of, these, studies, and, the, concerns, about, its, side, effects, antipsychotics, are, not, recommended, as, primary, treatment, of, rrbs, ssri, antidepressants, such, as, fluoxetine, and, fluvoxamine, have, been, shown, to, be, effective, in, reducing, repetitive, and, ritualistic, behaviors, while, the, stimulant, medication, methylphenidate, is, beneficial, for, some, children, with, comorbid, inattentiveness, or, hyperactivity, there, is, scant, reliable, research, about, the, effectiveness, or, safety, of, drug, treatments, for, adolescents, and, adults, with, asd, no, known, medication, relieves, autism, s, core, symptoms, of, social, and, communication, impairments, a, multitude, of, alternative, therapies, have, been, researched, and, implemented, and, many, have, resulted, in, harm, to, autistic, people, a, 2020, systematic, review, on, adults, with, autism, provided, evidence, that, mindfulness, based, interventions, may, decrease, stress, anxiety, ruminating, thoughts, anger, and, aggression, and, improve, mental, health, although, popularly, used, as, an, alternative, treatment, for, autistic, people, as, of, 2018, there, is, no, good, evidence, to, recommend, a, gluten, and, casein, free, diet, as, a, standard, treatment, a, 2018, review, concluded, that, it, may, be, a, therapeutic, option, for, specific, groups, of, children, with, autism, such, as, those, with, known, food, intolerances, or, allergies, or, with, food, intolerance, markers, the, authors, analyzed, the, prospective, trials, conducted, to, date, that, studied, the, efficacy, of, the, gluten, and, casein, free, diet, in, children, with, asd, 4, in, total, all, of, them, compared, gluten, and, casein, free, diet, versus, normal, diet, with, a, control, group, 2, double, blind, randomized, controlled, trials, 1, double, blind, crossover, trial, 1, single, blind, trial, in, two, of, the, studies, whose, duration, was, 12, and, 24, months, a, significant, improvement, in, asd, symptoms,

suggests, that, a, gluten, free, diet, may, improve, some, autistic, behaviors, the, preference, that, autistic, children, have, for, unconventional, foods, can, lead, to, reduction, in, bone, cortical, thickness, with, this, risk, being, greater, in, those, on, casein, free, diets, as, a, consequence, of, the, low, intake, of, calcium, and, vitamin, d, however, suboptimal, bone, development, in, asd, has, also, been, associated, with, lack, of, exercise, and, gastrointestinal, disorders, in, 2005, botched, chelation, therapy, killed, a, five, year, old, child, with, autism,

decrease, occasionally, to, the, extent, that, people, lose, their, diagnosis, of, asd, this, occurs, sometimes, after, intensive, treatment, and, sometimes, not, it, is, not, known, how, often, this, outcome, happens, with, reported, rates, in, unselected, samples, ranging, from, 3, to, 25, although, core, difficulties, tend, to, persist, symptoms, often, become, less, severe, with, age,

the, average, estimate, in, studies, published, during, that, period, with, a, trend, of, increasing, prevalence, over, time, however, the, study, s, 1, figure, may, reflect, an, underestimate, of, prevalence, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, the, number, of, people, diagnosed, has, increased, considerably, since, the, 1990s, which, may, be, partly, due, to, increased, recognition, of, the, condition, while, rates, of, asd, are, consistent, across, cultures, they, vary, greatly, by, gender, with, boys, diagnosed, far, more, frequently, than, girls, 1, in, 70, boys, but, only, 1, in, 315, girls, at, eight, years, of, age, girls, however, are, more, likely, to, have, associated, cognitive, impairment, suggesting, that, less, severe, forms, of, asd, are, likely, being, missed, in, girls, and, women, prevalence, differences, may, be, a, result, of, gender, differences, in, expression, of, clinical, symptoms, with, women, and, girls, with, autism, showing, less, atypical, behaviors, and, therefore, less, likely, to, receive, an, asd, diagnosis, using, dsm, 5, criteria, 92, of, the, children, diagnosed, per, dsm, iv, with, one, of, the, disorders, which, is, considered, part, of, asd, will, still, meet, the, diagnostic, criteria, of, asd, however, if, both, asd, and, the, social, pragmatic, communication, disorder, categories, of, dsm, 5, are, combined, the, prevalence, of, autism, is, mostly, unchanged, from, the, prevalence, per, the, dsm, iv, criteria, the, best, estimate, for, prevalence, of, asd, is, 0, 7, or, 1, child, in, 143, children, relatively, mild, forms, of, autism, such, as, asperger, s, as, well, as, other, developmental, disorders, are, included, in, the, dsm, 5, diagnostic, criteria, asd, rates, were, constant, between, 2014, and, 2016, but, twice, the, rate, compared, to, the, time, period, between, 2011, and, 2014, 1, 25, vs, 2, 47, a, canadian, meta, analysis, from, 2019, confirmed, these, effects, as, the, profiles, of, autistic, people, became, less, and, less, different, from, the, profiles, of, the, general, population, in, the, us, the, rates, for, diagnosed, asd, have, been, steadily, increasing, since, 2000, when, records, began, being, kept, while, it, remains, unclear, whether, this, trend, represents, a, true, rise, in, incidence, it, likely, reflects, changes, in, asd, diagnostic, criteria, improved, detection, and, increased, public, awareness, of, autism, in, 2012, the, nhs, estimated, that, the, overall, prevalence, of, autism, among, adults, aged, 18, years, and, over, in, the, uk, was, 1, 1, a, 2016, survey, in, the, united, states, reported, a, rate, of, 25, per, 1, 000, children, for, asd, rates, of, autism, are, poorly, understood, in, many, low, and, middle, income, countries, which, affects, the, accuracy, of, global, asd, prevalence, estimates, but, it, is, thought, that, most, autistic, people, live, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, in, 2020, the, centers, for, disease, control, s, autism, and, developmental, disabilities, monitoring, addm, network, reported, that, approximately, 1, in, 54, children, in, the, united, states, 1, in, 34, boys, and, 1, in, 144, girls, is, diagnosed, with, an, autism, spectrum, disorder, asd, based, on, data, collected, in, 2016, this, estimate, is, a, 10, increase, from, the, 1, in, 59, rate, in, 2014, a, 105, increase, from, the, 1, in, 110, rate, in, 2006, and, a, 176, increase, from, the, 1, in, 150, rate, in, 2000, diagnostic, criteria, for, asd, have, changed, significantly, since, the, 1980s, for, example, u, s, special, education, autism, classification, was, introduced, in, 1994, in, the, uk, from, 1998, to, 2018, the, autism, diagnoses, increased, by, 787, this, increase, is, largely, attributable, to, changes, in, diagnostic, practices, referral, patterns, availability, of, services, age, at, diagnosis, and, public, awareness, particularly, among, women, though, unidentified, environmental, risk, factors, cannot, be, ruled, out, the, available, evidence, does, not, rule, out, the, possibility, that, autism, s, true, prevalence, has, increased, a, real, increase, would, suggest, directing, more, attention, and, funding, toward, psychosocial, factors, and, changing, environmental, factors, instead, of, continuing, to, focus, on, genetics, it, has, been, established, that, vaccination, is, not, a, risk, factor, for, autism, and, is, not, a, cause, of, any, increase, in, autism, prevalence, rates, if, any, change, in, the, rate, of, autism, exists, at, all, males, have, higher, likelihood, of, being, diagnosed, with, asd, than, females, the, sex, ratio, averages, 4, 3, 1, and, is, greatly, modified, by, cognitive, impairment, it, may, be, close, to, 2, 1, with, intellectual, disability, and, more, than, 5, 5, 1, without, several, theories, about, the, higher, prevalence, in, males, have, been, investigated, but, the, cause, of, the, difference, is, unconfirmed, one, theory, is, that, females, are, underdiagnosed, the, risk, of, developing, autism, is, greater, with, older, fathers, than, with, older, mothers, two, potential, explanations, are, the, known, increase, in, mutation, burden, in, older, sperm, and, the, hypothesis, that, men, marry, later, if, they, carry, genetic, liability, and, show, some, signs, of, autism, most, professionals, believe, that, race, ethnicity, and, socioeconomic, background, do, not, affect, the, occurrence, of, autism, an, autistic, culture, has, emerged, accompanied, by, the, autistic, rights, and, neurodiversity, movements, that, argues, autism, should, be, accepted, as, a, difference, to, be, accommodated, instead, of, cured, although, a, minority, of, autistic, people, might, still, accept, a, cure, worldwide, events, related, to, autism, include, world, autism, awareness, day, autism, sunday, autistic, pride, day, autreat, and, others, social, science, scholars, study, those, with, autism, in, hopes, to, learn, more, about, autism, as, a, culture, transcultural, comparisons, and, research, on, social, movements, many, autistic, people, have, been, successful, in, their, fields, special, interests, are, commonly, found, in, autistic, people, sometimes, leading, to, hobbies, vast, collections, and, activism, environmental, activist, greta, thunberg, has, spoken, favorably, about, her, autism, diagnosis, saying, that, autism, can, be, a, source, of, life, purpose, as, well, as, forming, the, basis, of, careers, hobbies, and, friendships, some, autistic, people, as, well, as, a, growing, number, of, researchers, have, advocated, a, shift, in, attitudes, toward, the, view, that, autism, spectrum, disorder, is, a, difference, rather, than, a, disease, that, must, be, treated, or, cured, critics, have, bemoaned, the, entrenchment, of, some, of, these, groups, opinions, the, neurodiversity, movement, and, the, autism, rights, movement, are, social, movements, within, the, context, of, disability, rights, emphasizing, the, concept, of, neurodiversity, which, describes, the, autism, spectrum, as, a, result, of, natural, variations, in, the, human, brain, rather, than, a, disorder, to, be, cured, the, autism, rights, movement, advocates, including, greater, acceptance, of, autistic, behaviors, therapies, that, focus, on, coping, skills, rather, than, imitating, the, behaviors, of, those, without, autism, and, the, recognition, of, the, autistic, community, as, a, minority, group, autism, rights, or, neurodiversity, advocates, believe, that, the, autism, spectrum, is, genetic, and, should, be, accepted, as, a, natural, variation, in, the, human, genome, these, movements, are, not, without, detractors, a, common, argument, against, neurodiversity, activists, is, that, most, of, them, have, relatively, low, support, needs, or, are, self, diagnosed, and, do, not, represent, the, views, of, autistic, people, with, higher, support, needs, jacquiline, den, houting, explores, this, critique, determining, that, the, voices, of, low, support, needs, autistics, are, some, of, the, most, influential, within, the, neurodiversity, movement, although, admittedly, these, voices, are, a, minority, within, the, advocacy, community, she, suggests, this, is, in, part, a, shortcoming, of, the, wider, neurotypical, community, referencing, non, speaking, self, advocate, amy, sequenzia, s, writing, pier, jaarsma, and, stellan, welin, make, the, argument, that, only, high, functioning, autistic, people, should, be, included, under, the, neurodiversity, banner, as, low, functioning, autists, condition, may, rightfully, be, viewed, as, a, disability, the, concept, of, neurodiversity, is, contentious, in, autism, advocacy, and, research, groups, and, has, led, to, infighting, since, 2011, the, autistic, self, advocacy, network, has, celebrated, april, as, autism, acceptance, month, in, 2021, the, autism, society, of, america, urged, organizations, to, retitle, autism, awareness, day, as, autism, acceptance, day, to, focus, on, more, fully, integrating, those, 1, in, 54, americans, living, with, autism, into, our, social, fabric, over, the, years, multiple, organizations, have, tried, to, capture, the, essence, of, autism, in, symbols, in, 1963, the, board, for, the, national, autistic, society, led, by, gerald, gasson, proposed, the, puzzle, piece, as, a, symbol, for, autism, because, it, fit, their, view, of, autism, as, a, puzzling, condition, in, 1999, the, autism, society, adopted, the, puzzle, ribbon, as, the, universal, sign, of, autism, awareness, as, of, 2023, the, puzzle, ribbon, has, negative, associations, such, as, implications, of, autistic, people, as, incomplete, and, association, with, autism, hate, groups, in, 2004, neurodiversity, advocates, amy, and, gwen, nelson, conjured, the, rainbow, infinity, symbol, it, was, initially, the, logo, for, their, website, aspies, for, freedom, nowadays, the, prismatic, colors, are, often, associated, with, the, neurodiversity, movement, in, general, the, autism, spectrum, has, also, been, symbolized, by, the, infinity, symbol, itself, in, 2018, julian, morgan, wrote, the, article, light, it, up,
