bos, bonasus, linnaeus, 1758, the, european, bison, pl, bison, bison, bonasus, or, the, european, wood, bison, also, known, as, the, wisent, v, i, z, n, t, or, w, i, z, n, t, the, zubr, z, u, b, r, or, sometimes, colloquially, as, the, european, buffalo, is, a, european, species, of, bison, it, is, one, of, two, extant, species, of, bison, alongside, the, american, bison, the, european, bison, is, the, heaviest, wild, land, animal, in, europe, and, individuals, in, the, past, may, have, been, even, larger, than, their, modern, day, descendants, during, late, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, bison, became, extinct, in, much, of, europe, and, asia, surviving, into, the, 20th, century, only, in, northern, central, europe, and, the, northern, caucasus, mountains, during, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, bison, were, hunted, to, extinction, in, the, wild, by, the, late, 2010s, the, species, numbered, several, thousand, and, had, been, returned, to, the, wild, by, captive, breeding, programmes, it, is, no, longer, in, immediate, danger, of, extinction, but, remains, absent, from, most, of, its, historical, range, it, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, aurochs, bos, primigenius, the, extinct, ancestor, of, domestic, cattle, with, which, it, once, co, existed, besides, humans, bison, have, few, predators, in, the, 19th, century, there, were, scattered, reports, of, wolves, lions, tigers, and, bears, hunting, bison, in, the, past, especially, during, the, middle, ages, humans, commonly, killed, bison, for, their, hide, and, meat, they, used, their, horns, to, make, drinking, horns, european, bison, were, hunted, to, extinction, in, the, wild, in, the, early, 20th, century, with, the, last, wild, animals, of, the, b, b, bonasus, subspecies, being, shot, in, the, bia, owie, a, forest, on, today, s, belarus, poland, border, in, 1921, the, last, of, the, caucasian, wisent, subspecies, b, b, caucasicus, was, shot, in, the, northwestern, caucasus, in, 1927, the, carpathian, wisent, b, b, hungarorum, had, been, hunted, to, extinction, by, 1852, the, bia, owie, a, or, lowland, european, bison, was, kept, alive, in, captivity, and, has, since, been, reintroduced, into, several, countries, in, europe, in, 1996, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, classified, the, european, bison, as, an, endangered, species, no, longer, extinct, in, the, wild, its, status, has, improved, since, then, changing, to, vulnerable, and, later, to, near, threatened, european, bison, were, first, scientifically, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, some, later, descriptions, treat, the, european, bison, as, conspecific, with, the, american, bison, three, subspecies, of, the, european, bison, existed, in, the, recent, past, but, only, one, the, nominate, subspecies, b, b, bonasus, survives, today, the, ancestry, and, relationships, of, the, wisent, to, fossil, bison, species, remain, controversial, and, disputed, the, european, bison, is, one, of, the, national, animals, of, poland, and, belarus, the, ancient, greeks, and, ancient, romans, were, the, first, to, name, bison, as, such, the, 2nd, century, ad, authors, pausanias, and, oppian, referred, to, them, as, hellenistic, greek, romanized, bis, n, earlier, in, the, 4th, century, bc, during, the, hellenistic, period, aristotle, referred, to, bison, as, b, nasos, he, also, noted, that, the, paeonians, called, it, monapos, claudius, aelianus, writing, in, the, late, 2nd, or, early, 3rd, centuries, ad, also, referred, to, the, species, as, and, both, pliny, the, elder, s, natural, history, and, gaius, julius, solinus, used, latin, b, son, and, bon, sus, both, martial, and, seneca, the, younger, mention, bison, pl, bisontes, later, latin, spellings, of, the, term, included, visontes, vesontes, and, bissontes, john, trevisa, is, the, earliest, author, cited, by, the, oxford, english, dictionary, as, using, in, his, 1398, translation, of, bartholomeus, anglicus, s, de, proprietatibus, rerum, the, latin, plural, bisontes, in, english, as, bysontes, middle, english, by, ontes, and, bysountes, philemon, holland, s, 1601, translation, of, pliny, s, natural, history, referred, to, bisontes, the, marginalia, of, the, king, james, version, gives, bison, as, a, gloss, for, the, biblical, animal, called, the, pygarg, mentioned, in, the, book, of, deuteronomy, randle, cotgrave, s, 1611, french, english, dictionary, notes, that, french, bison, was, already, in, use, and, it, may, have, influenced, the, adoption, of, the, word, into, english, or, alternatively, it, may, have, been, borrowed, direct, from, latin, john, minsheu, s, 1617, lexicon, ductor, in, linguas, gives, a, definition, for, b, son, early, modern, english, a, wilde, oxe, great, eied, broad, faced, that, will, neuer, be, tamed, in, the, 18th, century, the, name, of, the, european, animal, was, applied, to, the, closely, related, american, bison, initially, in, latin, in, 1693, by, john, ray, and, the, indian, bison, the, gaur, bos, gaurus, historically, the, word, was, also, applied, to, indian, domestic, cattle, the, zebu, b, indicus, or, b, primigenius, indicus, because, of, the, scarcity, of, the, european, bison, the, word, bison, was, most, familiar, in, relation, to, the, american, species, by, the, time, of, the, adoption, of, bison, into, early, modern, english, the, early, medieval, english, name, for, the, species, had, long, been, obsolete, the, old, english, wesend, had, descended, from, proto, germanic, wisand, wisund, and, was, related, to, old, norse, v, sundr, the, word, wisent, was, then, borrowed, in, the, 19th, century, from, modern, german, wisent, itself, related, to, old, high, german, wisunt, wisent, wisint, and, to, middle, high, german, wisant, wisent, wisen, and, ultimately, like, the, old, english, name, from, proto, germanic, the, proto, germanic, root, wis, also, found, in, weasel, originally, referred, to, the, animal, s, musk, the, word, zubr, in, english, is, a, borrowing, from, polish, ubr, previously, also, used, to, denote, one, race, of, the, european, bison, the, polish, ubr, is, similar, to, the, word, for, the, european, bison, in, other, modern, slavic, languages, such, as, upper, sorbian, ubr, and, russian, the, noun, for, the, european, bison, in, all, living, slavonic, tongues, is, thought, to, be, derived, from, proto, slavic, z, br, iz, br, which, itself, possibly, comes, from, proto, indo, european, mb,

northern, bulgaria, the, wisent, was, thought, to, have, survived, until, the, 9th, or, 10th, century, ad, but, more, recent, data, summary, shows, that, the, species, survived, up, to, 13th, 14th, century, ad, in, eastern, bulgaria, and, up, to, 16th, 17th, century, ad, in, the, northern, part, of, the, country, there, is, a, possibility, that, the, species, range, extended, to, east, thrace, during, the, 7th, 8th, century, ad, its, population, in, gaul, was, extinct, in, the, 8th, century, ad, the, species, survived, in, the, ardennes, and, the, vosges, mountains, until, the, 15th, century, in, the, early, middle, ages, the, wisent, apparently, still, occurred, in, the, forest, steppes, east, of, the, urals, in, the, altai, mountains, and, seems, to, have, reached, lake, baikal, in, the, east, the, northern, boundary, in, the, holocene, was, probably, around, 60, n, in, finland, european, bison, survived, in, a, few, natural, forests, in, europe, but, their, numbers, dwindled, in, 1513, the, bia, owie, a, forest, at, this, point, one, of, the, last, areas, on, earth, where, the, european, bison, still, roamed, free, was, transferred, from, the, troki, voivodeship, of, lithuania, to, the, podlaskie, voivodeship, which, after, the, union, of, lublin, became, part, of, the, polish, crown, in, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, at, first, european, bison, in, the, bia, owie, a, forest, were, legally, the, property, of, the, grand, dukes, of, lithuania, and, later, belonged, to, the, crown, of, the, kingdom, of, poland, polish, lithuanian, rulers, took, measures, to, protect, the, european, bison, such, as, king, sigismund, ii, augustus, who, instituted, the, death, penalty, for, poaching, bison, in, bia, owie, a, in, the, mid, 16th, century, wild, european, bison, herds, existed, in, the, forest, until, the, mid, 17th, century, in, 1701, king, augustus, ii, the, strong, greatly, increased, protection, over, the, forest, the, first, written, sources, mentioning, the, use, of, some, forest, meadows, for, the, production, of, winter, fodder, for, the, bison, come, from, this, period, in, the, early, 19th, century, after, the, partitions, of, the, polish, commonwealth, the, russian, tsars, retained, old, polish, lithuanian, laws, protecting, the, european, bison, herd, in, bia, owie, a, despite, these, measures, and, others, the, european, bison, population, continued, to, decline, over, the, following, century, with, only, bia, owie, a, and, northern, caucasus, populations, surviving, into, the, 20th, century, the, last, european, bison, in, transylvania, died, in, 1790, during, world, war, i, occupying, german, troops, killed, 600, of, the, european, bison, in, the, bia, owie, a, forest, for, sport, meat, hides, and, horns, a, german, scientist, informed, army, officers, that, the, european, bison, were, facing, imminent, extinction, but, at, the, very, end, of, the, war, retreating, german, soldiers, shot, all, but, nine, animals, the, last, wild, european, bison, in, poland, was, killed, in, 1921, the, last, wild, european, bison, in, the, world, was, killed, by, poachers, in, 1927, in, the, western, caucasus, by, that, year, 48, remained, all, held, by, zoos, the, international, society, for, the, preservation, of, the, wisent, was, founded, on, 25, and, 26, august, 1923, in, berlin, following, the, example, of, the, american, bison, society, the, first, chairman, was, kurt, priemel, director, of, the, frankfurt, zoo, and, among, the, members, were, experts, like, hermann, pohle, max, hilzheimer, and, julius, riemer, the, first, goal, of, the, society, was, to, take, stock, of, all, living, bison, in, preparation, for, a, breeding, programme, important, members, were, the, polish, hunting, association, and, the, pozna, zoological, gardens, as, well, as, a, number, of, polish, private, individuals, who, provided, funds, to, acquire, the, first, bison, cows, and, bulls, the, breeding, book, was, published, in, the, company, s, annual, report, from, 1932, while, priemel, aimed, to, grow, the, population, slowly, with, pure, conservation, of, the, breeding, line, lutz, heck, planned, to, grow, the, population, faster, by, cross, breeding, with, american, bison, in, a, separate, breeding, project, in, munich, in, 1934, heck, gained, the, support, of, then, reichsj, germeister, hermann, g, ring, who, hoped, for, huntable, big, game, heck, promised, his, powerful, supporter, in, writing, since, surplus, bulls, will, soon, be, set, the, hunting, of, the, wisent, will, be, possible, again, in, the, foreseeable, future, g, ring, himself, took, over, the, patronage, of, the, german, professional, association, of, wisent, breeders, and, hegers, founded, at, heck, s, suggestion, kurt, priemel, who, had, since, resigned, as, president, of, the, international, society, for, the, preservation, of, the, wisent, warned, in, vain, against, manification, heck, answered, by, announcing, that, g, ring, would, take, action, against, priemel, if, he, continued, to, oppose, his, crossing, plans, priemel, was, then, banned, from, publishing, in, relation, to, bison, breeding, and, the, regular, bookkeeper, of, the, international, society, erna, mohr, was, forced, to, hand, over, the, official, register, in, 1937, thus, the, older, society, was, effectively, incorporated, into, the, newly, created, professional, association, after, the, second, world, war, therefore, only, the, pure, blooded, bison, in, the, game, park, springe, near, hanover, were, recognised, as, part, of, the, international, herd, book, the, first, two, bison, were, released, into, the, wild, in, the, bia, owie, a, forest, in, 1929, by, 1964, more, than, 100, existed, over, the, following, decades, thanks, to, polish, and, international, efforts, the, bia, owie, a, forest, regained, its, position, as, the, location, with, the, world, s, largest, population, of, european, bison, including, those, in, the, wild, in, 2005, 2007, a, wild, bison, nicknamed, pubal, became, renowned, in, southeast, poland, due, to, his, friendly, interactions, with, humans, and, unwillingness, to, reintegrate, into, the, wild, as, of, 2014, there, were, 1, 434, wisents, in, poland, out, of, which, 1, 212, were, in, free, range, herds, and, 522, belonged, to, the, wild, population, in, the, bia, owie, a, forest, compared, to, 2013, the, total, population, in, 2014, increased, by, 4, 1, while, the, free, ranging, population, increased, by, 6, 5, bison, from, poland, have, also, been, transported, beyond, the, country, s, borders, to, boost, the, local, populations, of, other, countries, among, them, bulgaria, spain, romania, czechia, and, others, poland, has, been, described, as, the, world, s, breeding, centre, of, the, european, bison, where, the, bison, population, doubled, between, 1995, and, 2017, reaching, 2, 269, by, the, end, of, 2019, the, total, population, has, been, increasing, by, around, 15, to, 18, yearly, in, july, 2022, a, small, population, was, released, into, woodland, by, canterbury, in, kent, to, trial, their, reintroduction, into, the, uk, in, may, 2024, a, small, population, was, released, in, central, portugal, a, 2003, study, of, mitochondrial, dna, indicated, four, distinct, maternal, lineages, in, the, tribe, bovini, y, chromosome, analysis, associated, wisent, and, american, bison, an, earlier, study, using, amplified, fragment, length, polymorphism, fingerprinting, showed, a, close, association, of, wisent, and, american, bison, and, probably, with, yak, it, noted, the, interbreeding, of, bovini, species, made, determining, relationships, problematic, european, bison, can, crossbreed, with, american, bison, this, hybrid, is, known, in, poland, as, a, ubrobizon, the, products, of, a, german, interbreeding, programme, were, destroyed, after, the, second, world, war, this, programme, was, related, to, the, impulse, which, created, the, heck, cattle, the, cross, bred, individuals, created, at, other, zoos, were, eliminated, from, breed, books, by, the, 1950s, a, russian, back, breeding, programme, resulted, in, a, wild, herd, of, hybrid, animals, which, presently, lives, in, the, caucasian, biosphere, reserve, 550, animals, in, 1999, wisent, cattle, hybrids, also, occur, similar, to, the, north, american, beefalo, cattle, and, european, bison, hybridise, fairly, readily, first, generation, males, are, infertile, in, 1847, a, herd, of, wisent, cattle, hybrids, named, ubro, u, b, r, nj, was, created, by, leopold, walicki, the, animals, were, intended, to, become, durable, and, cheap, alternatives, to, cattle, the, experiment, was, continued, by, researchers, from, the, polish, academy, of, sciences, until, the, late, 1980s, although, the, program, resulted, in, a, quite, successful, animal, that, was, both, hardy, and, could, be, bred, in, marginal, grazing, lands, it, was, eventually, discontinued, currently, the, only, surviving, ubro, herd, consists, of, just, a, few, animals, in, bia, owie, a, forest, poland, and, belarus, in, 2016, the, first, whole, genome, sequencing, data, from, two, european, bison, bulls, from, the, bia, owie, a, forest, revealed, that, the, bison, and, bovine, species, diverged, from, about, 1, 7, to, 0, 85, mya, through, a, speciation, process, involving, limited, gene, flow, these, data, further, support, the, occurrence, of, more, recent, secondary, contacts, posterior, to, the, divergence, between, bos, primigenius, primigenius, and, b, p, namadicus, ca, 150, 000, years, ago, between, the, wisent, and, european, taurine, cattle, lineages, an, independent, study, of, mitochondrial, dna, and, autosomal, markers, confirmed, these, secondary, contacts, with, an, estimate, of, up, to, 10, of, bovine, ancestry, in, the, modern, wisent, genome, leading, the, authors, to, go, further, in, their, conclusions, by, proposing, the, wisent, to, be, a, hybrid, between, steppe, bison, and, aurochs, with, a, hybridisation, event, originating, before, 120, 000, years, ago, however, other, studies, considered, the, 10, estimate, for, aurochs, gene, flow, a, gross, overstimate, and, based, on, flawed, data, and, not, supported, by, the, data, from, the, full, nuclear, genome, of, the, wisent, some, of, the, authors, however, support, the, hypothesis, that, similarity, of, wisent, and, cattle, bos, mitochondrial, genomes, is, result, of, incomplete, lineage, sorting, during, divergence, of, bos, and, bison, from, their, common, ancestors, rather, than, further, post, speciation, gene, flow, ancient, hybridisation, between, bos, and, bison, but, they, agree, that, limited, gene, flow, from, bos, primigenius, taurus, could, account, for, the, affiliation, between, wisent, and, cattle, nuclear, genomes, in, contrast, to, mitochondrial, ones, alternatively, genome, sequencing, completed, on, remains, attributed, to, the, pleistocene, woodland, bison, b, schoetensacki, and, published, in, 2017, posited, that, genetic, similarities, between, the, pleistocene, woodland, bison, and, the, wisent, suggest, that, b, schoetensaki, was, the, ancestor, of, the, european, wisent, however, other, studies, have, disputed, the, attribution, of, the, remains, to, this, species, otherwise, known, from, remains, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, older, instead, referring, them, to, an, unnamed, lineage, of, bison, closely, related, to, b, bonasius, a, 2018, study, proposed, that, the, lineage, leading, to, the, wisent, and, to, the, lineage, ancestral, to, both, the, american, bison, and, bison, priscus, had, split, over, 1, million, years, ago, with, the, mitochondrial, dna, discrepancy, being, the, result, of, incomplete, lineage, sorting, the, authors, also, proposed, that, during, the, late, middle, pleistocene, there, had, been, interbreeding, between, the, ancestor, of, the, wisent, and, the, common, ancestor, of, bison, priscus, and, the, american, bison, the, european, bison, is, a, herd, animal, which, lives, in, both, mixed, and, solely, male, groups, mixed, groups, consist, of, adult, females, calves, young, aged, 2, 3, years, and, young, adult, bulls, the, average, herd, size, is, dependent, on, environmental, factors, though, on, average, they, number, eight, to, 13, animals, per, herd, herds, consisting, solely, of, bulls, are, smaller, than, mixed, ones, containing, two, individuals, on, average, european, bison, herds, are, not, family, units, different, herds, frequently, interact, combine, and, quickly, split, after, exchanging, individuals, bison, social, structure, has, been, described, by, specialists, as, a, matriarchy, as, it, is, the, cows, of, the, herd, that, lead, it, and, decide, where, the, entire, group, moves, to, graze, although, larger, and, heavier, than, the, females, the, oldest, and, most, powerful, male, bulls, are, usually, satellites, that, hang, around, the, edges, of, the, herd, to, protect, the, group, bulls, begin, to, serve, a, more, active, role, in, the, herd, when, a, danger, to, the, group, s, safety, appears, as, well, as, during, the, mating, season, when, they, compete, with, each, other, territory, held, by, bulls, is, correlated, by, age, with, young, bulls, aged, between, five, and, six, tending, to, form, larger, home, ranges, than, older, males, the, european, bison, does, not, defend, territory, and, herd, ranges, tend, to, greatly, overlap, core, areas, of, territory, are, usually, sited, near, meadows, and, water, sources, the, rutting, season, occurs, from, august, through, to, october, bulls, aged, 4, 6, years, though, sexually, mature, are, prevented, from, mating, by, older, bulls, cows, usually, have, a, gestation, period, of, 264, days, and, typically, give, birth, to, one, calf, at, a, time, on, average, male, calves, weigh, 27, 6, kg, 60, 8, lb, at, birth, and, females, 24, 4, kg, 53, 8, lb, body, size, in, males, increases, proportionately, to, the, age, of, 6, years, while, females, have, a, higher, increase, in, body, mass, in, their, first, year, their, growth, rate, is, comparatively, slower, than, that, of, males, by, the, age, of, 3, 5, bulls, reach, sexual, maturity, at, the, age, of, two, while, cows, do, so, in, their, third, year, european, bison, have, lived, as, long, as, 30, years, in, captivity, but, in, the, wild, their, lifespans, are, shorter, the, lifespan, of, a, bison, in, the, wild, is, usually, between, 18, and, 24, years, though, females, live, longer, than, males, productive, breeding, years, are, between, four, and, 20, years, of, age, in, females, and, only, between, six, and, 12, years, of, age, in, males, european, bison, feed, predominantly, on, grasses, although, they, also, browse, on, shoots, and, leaves, in, summer, an, adult, male, can, consume, 32, kg, of, food, in, a, day, european, bison, in, the, bia, owie, a, forest, in, poland, have, traditionally, been, fed, hay, in, the, winter, for, centuries, and, large, herds, may, gather, around, this, diet, supplement, european, bison, need, to, drink, every, day, and, in, winter, can, be, seen, breaking, ice, with, their, heavy, hooves, although, superficially, similar, a, number, of, physical, and, behavioural, differences, are, seen, between, the, european, bison, and, the, american, bison, the, bison, has, 14, pairs, of, ribs, while, the, american, bison, has, 15, adult, european, bison, are, on, average, taller, than, american, bison, and, have, longer, legs, european, bison, tend, to, browse, more, and, graze, less, than, their, american, relatives, due, to, their, necks, being, set, differently, compared, to, the, american, bison, the, nose, of, the, european, bison, is, set, further, forward, than, the, forehead, when, the, neck, is, in, a, neutral, position, the, body, of, the, wisent, is, less, hairy, though, its, tail, is, hairier, than, that, of, the, american, species, the, horns, of, the, european, bison, point, forward, through, the, plane, of, their, faces, making, them, more, adept, at, fighting, through, the, interlocking, of, horns, in, the, same, manner, as, domestic, cattle, unlike, the, american, bison, which, favours, charging, european, bison, are, less, tameable, than, the, american, ones, and, breed, with, domestic, cattle, less, readily, the, european, bison, is, less, shaggy, with, a, more, lanky, body, shape, in, terms, of, behavioural, capability, european, bison, runs, slower, and, with, less, stamina, yet, jumps, higher, and, longer, than, american, bisons, showing, signs, of, more, developed, adaptations, into, mountainous, habitats, the, protection, of, the, european, bison, has, a, long, history, between, the, 15th, and, 18th, centuries, those, in, the, forest, of, bia, owie, a, were, protected, and, their, diet, supplemented, efforts, to, restore, this, species, to, the, wild, began, in, 1929, with, the, establishment, of, the, bison, restitution, centre, at, bia, owie, a, poland, subsequently, in, 1948, the, bison, breeding, centre, was, established, within, the, prioksko, terrasny, biosphere, reserve, the, modern, herds, are, managed, as, two, separate, lines, one, consisting, of, only, bison, bonasus, bonasus, all, descended, from, only, seven, animals, and, one, consisting, of, all, 12, ancestors, including, the, one, b, b, caucasicus, bull, the, latter, is, generally, not, considered, a, separate, subspecies, because, they, contain, dna, from, both, b, b, bonasus, and, b, b, caucasicius, although, some, scientists, classify, them, as, a, new, subspecies, b, b, montanus, only, a, limited, amount, of, inbreeding, depression, from, the, population, bottleneck, has, been, found, having, a, small, effect, on, skeletal, growth, in, cows, and, a, small, rise, in, calf, mortality, genetic, variability, continues, to, shrink, from, five, initial, bulls, all, current, european, bison, bulls, have, one, of, only, two, remaining, y, chromosomes, beginning, in, 1951, european, bison, have, been, reintroduced, into, the, wild, including, some, areas, where, they, were, never, found, wild, free, ranging, herds, are, currently, found, in, poland, lithuania, belarus, ukraine, bulgaria, romania, russia, slovakia, latvia, switzerland, kyrgyzstan, germany, and, in, forest, preserves, in, the, western, caucasus, the, bia, owie, a, primeval, forest, an, ancient, woodland, that, straddles, the, border, between, poland, and, belarus, continues, to, have, the, largest, free, living, european, bison, population, in, the, world, with, around, 1000, wild, bison, counted, in, 2014, herds, have, also, been, introduced, in, moldova, 2005, spain, 2010, denmark, 2012, the, czech, republic, 2014, and, portugal, 2024, reintroduction, of, bison, to, a, 20, square, mile, grasslands, area, in, the, arcu, mountains, of, romania, in, 2014, was, found, to, have, resulted, in, an, additional, 54, 000, tons, of, carbon, draw, down, annually, the, wilder, blean, project, headed, up, by, the, wildwood, trust, and, kent, wildlife, trust, introduced, european, bison, to, the, uk, for, the, first, time, in, 6000, years, although, there, was, an, unsuccessful, attempt, in, scotland, in, 2011, and, the, european, bison, is, not, confirmed, to, be, native, to, england, while, the, british, isles, once, used, to, be, inhabited, by, now, extinct, steppe, bison, and, pleistocene, woodland, bison, the, herd, of, 3, females, with, plans, to, also, release, a, male, in, the, following, months, was, set, free, in, july, 2022, within, a, 2, 500, acre, conservation, area, in, west, blean, and, thornden, woods, near, canterbury, unknown, to, the, rangers, one, of, the, females, was, pregnant, and, gave, birth, to, a, calf, in, october, 2022, marking, the, first, wild, bison, born, in, the, uk, for, the, first, time, in, millennia, as, below, mentioned, there, are, established, herds, in, spain, portugal, and, italy, however, european, bison, has, not, been, recorded, naturally, from, the, iberian, and, italian, peninsulas, while, these, regions, were, once, inhabited, by, pleistocene, woodland, bison, and, steppe, bison, the, total, worldwide, population, recorded, in, 2019, was, around, 7, 500, about, half, of, this, number, being, in, poland, and, belarus, with, over, 25, of, the, global, population, located, in, poland, alone, for, 2016, the, number, was, 6, 573, including, 4, 472, free, ranging, and, has, been, increasing, some, local, populations, are, estimated, as, the, largest, european, bison, herds, of, both, captive, and, wild, populations, are, still, located, in, poland, and, belarus, the, majority, of, which, can, be, found, in, the, bia, owie, a, forest, including, the, most, numerous, population, of, free, living, european, bison, in, the, world, with, most, of, the, animals, living, on, the, polish, side, of, the, border, poland, remains, the, world, s, breeding, centre, for, the, wisent, in, the, years, 1945, to, 2014, from, the, bia, owie, a, national, park, alone, 553, specimens, were, sent, to, most, captive, populations, of, the, bison, in, europe, as, well, as, all, breeding, sanctuaries, for, the, species, in, poland, since, 1983, a, small, reintroduced, population, lives, in, the, altai, mountains, this, population, suffers, from, inbreeding, depression, and, needs, the, introduction, of, unrelated, animals, for, blood, refreshment, in, the, long, term, authorities, hope, to, establish, a, population, of, about, 1, 000, animals, in, the, area, one, of, the, northernmost, current, populations, of, the, european, bison, lives, in, vologodskaya, oblast, in, the, northern, dvina, valley, at, about, 60, n, it, survives, without, supplementary, winter, feeding, another, russian, population, lives, in, the, forests, around, the, desna, river, on, the, border, between, russia, and, ukraine, the, north, easternmost, population, lives, in, pleistocene, park, south, of, chersky, in, siberia, a, project, to, recreate, the, steppe, ecosystem, which, began, to, be, altered, 10, 000, years, ago, five, wisents, were, introduced, on, 24, april, 2011, the, wisents, were, brought, to, the, park, from, the, prioksko, terrasny, nature, reserve, near, moscow, the, bison, originated, from, a, population, in, denmark, winter, temperatures, often, drop, below, 50, c, four, of, the, five, bison, have, subsequently, died, due, to, problems, acclimatizing, to, the, low, winter, temperature, plans, are, being, made, to, reintroduce, two, herds, in, germany, and, in, the, netherlands, in, oostvaardersplassen, nature, reserve, in, flevoland, as, well, as, the, veluwe, in, 2007, a, bison, pilot, project, in, a, fenced, area, was, begun, in, zuid, kennemerland, national, park, in, the, netherlands, because, of, their, limited, genetic, pool, they, are, considered, highly, vulnerable, to, illnesses, such, as, foot, and, mouth, disease, in, march, 2016, a, herd, was, released, in, the, maashorst, nature, reserve, in, north, brabant, zoos, in, 30, countries, also, have, quite, a, few, bison, involved, in, captive, breeding, programs, representations, of, the, european, bison, from, different, ages, across, millennia, of, human, society, s, existence, can, be, found, throughout, eurasia, in, the, form, of, drawings, and, rock, carvings, one, of, the, oldest, and, most, famous, instances, of, the, latter, can, be, found, in, the, cave, of, altamira, present, day, spain, where, cave, art, featuring, the, wisent, from, the, upper, paleolithic, was, discovered, the, bison, has, also, been, represented, in, a, wide, range, of, art, in, human, history, such, as, sculptures, paintings, photographs, glass, art, and, more, sculptures, of, the, wisent, constructed, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, continue, to, stand, in, a, number, of, european, cities, arguably, the, most, notable, of, these, are, the, zubr, statue, in, spa, a, from, 1862, designed, by, mih, ly, zichy, and, the, two, bison, sculptures, in, kiel, sculpted, by, august, gaul, in, 1910, 1913, however, a, number, of, other, monuments, to, the, animal, also, exist, such, as, those, in, hajn, wka, and, pszczyna, or, at, the, kyiv, zoo, entrance, miko, aj, hussowczyk, a, poet, writing, in, latin, about, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, during, the, early, 16th, century, described, the, bison, in, a, historically, significant, fictional, work, from, 1523, the, european, bison, is, considered, one, of, the, national, animals, of, poland, and, belarus, due, to, this, and, the, fact, that, half, of, the, worldwide, european, bison, population, can, be, found, spread, across, these, two, countries, the, wisent, is, still, featured, prominently, in, the, heraldry, of, these, neighbouring, states, especially, in, the, overlapping, region, of, eastern, poland, and, western, belarus, examples, in, poland, include, the, coats, of, arms, of, the, counties, of, hajn, wka, and, zambr, w, the, towns, sok, ka, and, ywiec, the, villages, bia, owie, a, and, narewka, as, well, as, the, coats, of, arms, of, the, pomian, and, wieniawa, families, examples, in, belarus, include, the, grodno, and, brest, voblasts, the, town, of, svislach, and, others, the, european, bison, can, also, be, found, on, the, coats, of, arms, of, places, in, neighbouring, countries, perloja, in, southern, lithuania, lypovets, in, west, central, ukraine, and, zub, in, east, czechia, as, well, as, further, outside, the, region, such, as, kortezubi, in, the, basque, country, and, jabel, in, germany, a, flavoured, vodka, called, ubr, wka, originating, as, a, recipe, of, the, szlachta, of, the, kingdom, of, poland, in, the, 14th, century, has, since, 1928, been, industrially, produced, as, a, brand, in, poland, in, the, decades, that, followed, it, became, known, as, the, world, s, best, known, polish, vodka, and, sparked, the, creation, of, a, number, of, copy, brands, inspired, by, the, original, in, belarus, russia, germany, as, well, as, other, brands, in, poland, the, original, polish, brand, is, known, for, placing, a, decorative, blade, of, bison, grass, from,
