tapioca, from, cassava, manihot, esculenta, which, is, often, labeled, arrowroot, polynesian, arrowroot, or, pia, tacca, leontopetaloides, from, palawan, philippines, arrowroot, uraro, araro, and, japanese, arrowroot, pueraria, lobata, also, called, kudzu, are, used, in, similar, ways, in, india, it, is, called, palua, archaeological, studies, in, the, americas, show, evidence, of, arrowroot, cultivation, as, early, as, 7, 000, years, ago, the, name, may, come, from, aru, aru, meal, of, meals, in, the, language, of, the, caribbean, arawak, people, for, whom, the, plant, was, a, staple, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, name, comes, from, arrowroot, s, use, in, treating, poison, arrow, wounds, as, it, draws, out, the, poison, when, applied, to, the, site, of, the, injury, in, the, early, days, of, carbonless, copy, paper, arrowroot, because, of, its, fine, grain, size, was, a, widely, used, ingredient, after, an, economical, way, of, centrifugally, separating, wheat, flour, was, devised, arrowroot, lost, its, role, in, papermaking, saint, vincent, has, a, long, history, of, arrowroot, production, the, industry, started, as, the, food, and, medicine, of, the, carib, and, garifuna, peoples, and, developed, to, the, status, of, a, major, export, of, st, vincent, during, the, period, 1900, to, 1965, it, became, an, important, commodity, in, colonial, trade, in, the, 1930s, as, the, sugar, industry, declined, in, the, nineteenth, century, cultivation, of, arrowroot, was, developed, to, fill, the, void, since, then, the, area, cultivated, has, declined, steadily, as, other, crops, particularly, bananas, have, gained, wider, acceptance, by, farmers, evidence, of, its, former, importance, is, indicated, by, the, ruins, of, the, various, magnificent, 19th, century, factories, located, in, valleys, on, the, st, vincent, mainland, arrowroot, cultivation, is, now, concentrated, on, farms, located, north, of, the, rabacca, river, particularly, in, the, owia, area, this, is, also, the, area, where, the, population, of, carib, descent, is, concentrated, in, 1998, 99, the, industry, produced, 312, 000, lb, 142, 000, kg, of, starch, about, 3, of, the, peak, level, in, the, 1960s, in, the, past, the, st, vincent, arrowroot, industry, played, an, important, role, in, the, economy, of, the, island, contributing, close, to, 50, of, the, country, s, foreign, export, earnings, and, was, the, principal, source, of, employment, and, income, of, the, rural, people, from, the, 1930s, to, the, 1960s, the, plant, is, propagated, from, rhizomes, and, cultivation, takes, place, at, elevations, up, to, 300, metres, on, the, eastern, and, windward, facing, side, of, the, highlands, of, st, vincent, cultivation, covers, an, area, of, about, 3, 700, ha, and, some, 80, of, the, crop, is, grown, by, small, farmers, the, arrowroot, plant, is, very, hardy, and, not, very, demanding, in, its, requirements, st, vincent, particularly, the, north, east, coast, provides, the, ideal, growing, conditions, for, optimal, yields, deep, well, drained, slightly, acidic, soils, and, a, hot, humid, climate, some, farmers, produce, the, crop, by, shifting, cultivation, on, the, cleared, forested, slopes, the, harvesting, season, extends, from, october, to, may, on, the, larger, estates, the, harvesting, of, the, rhizome, usually, proceeds, from, the, base, of, a, hill, towards, the, top, harvesting, involves, breaking, off, the, rhizome, from, the, shoot, planting, and, harvesting, are, inter, related, in, that, when, the, rhizomes, are, harvested, the, shoot, is, replanted, at, the, same, time, in, st, vincent, much, use, is, made, of, rural, unemployment, and, many, women, workers, are, involved, in, the, various, phases, of, operation, mechanical, harvesters, have, recently, been, introduced, allowing, faster, arrowroot, harvesting, six, factories, process, the, island, s, arrowroot, and, large, processing, plants, are, located, at, belle, vue, and, at, owia, arrowroot, tubers, contain, about, 23, starch, they, are, first, washed, and, then, cleaned, of, the, paper, like, scale, the, scales, must, be, carefully, removed, before, extracting, the, starch, because, they, impart, a, disagreeable, flavour, after, removing, the, scale, the, roots, are, washed, again, drained, and, finally, reduced, to, a, pulp, by, beating, them, in, mortars, or, subjecting, them, to, the, action, of, a, wheel, rasp, the, milky, liquid, thus, obtained, is, passed, through, a, coarse, cloth, or, hair, sieve, and, the, pure, starch, which, is, insoluble, is, allowed, to, settle, at, the, bottom, the, wet, starch, is, dried, in, the, sun, or, in, a, drying, house, the, result, is, a, powder, the, arrowroot, of, commerce, that, is, quickly, packed, for, market, in, air, tight, cans, packages, or, cases, arrowroot, starch, has, in, the, past, been, quite, extensively, adulterated, with, potato, starch, and, other, similar, substances, pure, arrowroot, like, other, pure, starches, is, a, light, white, powder, the, mass, feeling, firm, to, the, finger, and, crackling, like, newly, fallen, snow, when, rubbed, or, pressed, odourless, when, dry, but, emitting, a, faint, peculiar, odour, when, mixed, with, boiling, water, and, swelling, on, cooking, into, a, perfect, jelly, which, can, be, used, to, make, a, food, that, is, very, smooth, in, consistency, unlike, adulterated, articles, mixed, with, potato, flour, and, other, starches, of, lower, value, which, contain, larger, particles, microscopically, the, arrow, root, starch, is, oval, in, shape, and, with, hilum, at, the, proximal, end, arrowroot, can, be, consumed, in, the, form, of, biscuits, puddings, jellies, cakes, hot, sauces, and, also, with, beef, tea, milk, or, veal, broth, kudzu, arrowroot, pueraria, lobata, is, used, in, noodles, in, korean, and, vietnamese, cuisine, in, the, victorian, era, it, was, used, boiled, with, a, little, flavouring, added, as, an, easily, digestible, food, for, children, and, people, with, dietary, restrictions, in, burma, arrowroot, tubers, which, are, called, artarlut, are, boiled, or, steamed, and, eaten, with, salt, and, oil, arrowroot, makes, clear, shimmering, fruit, gels, and, prevents, ice, crystals, from, forming, in, homemade, ice, cream, it, can, also, be, used, as, a, thickener, for, acidic, foods, such, as, east, asian, sweet, and, sour, sauce, it, is, used, in, cooking, to, produce, a, clear, thickened, sauce, such, as, a, fruit, sauce, it, will, not, make, the, sauce, go, cloudy, like, cornstarch, flour, or, other, starchy, thickening, agents, would, the, lack, of, gluten, in, arrowroot, flour, makes, it, useful, as, a, replacement, for, wheat, flour, for, those, with, a, gluten, intolerance, it, is, however, relatively, high, in, carbohydrates, and, low, in, protein, approximately, 7, 7, and, does, not, provide, a, complete, substitute, for, wheat, flour, in, bread, making, arrowroot, thickens, at, a, lower, temperature, than, flour, or, cornstarch, is, not, weakened, by, acidic, ingredients, has, a, more, neutral, taste, and, is, not, affected, by, freezing, it, does, not, mix, well, with, dairy, forming, a, slimy, mixture, it, is, recommended, that, arrowroot, be, mixed, with, a, cool, liquid, before, adding, to, a, hot, fluid, the, mixture, should, be, heated, only, until, the, mixture, thickens, and, removed, immediately, to, prevent, the, mixture, from, thinning, overheating, tends, to, break, down, arrowroot, s, thickening, property, two, teaspoons, of, arrowroot, can, be, substituted, for, one, tablespoon, of, cornstarch, or, one, teaspoon, of, arrowroot, for, one, tablespoon, of, wheat, flour, the, english, pub, game, of, shove, halfpenny, involving, sliding, a, coin, across, a, graduated, slate, board, traditionally, uses, arrowroot, powder, as, a, lubricating, medium
