a, steroid, is, an, organic, compound, with, four, fused, rings, designated, a, b, c, and, d, arranged, in, a, specific, molecular, configuration, steroids, have, two, principal, biological, functions, as, important, components, of, cell, membranes, that, alter, membrane, fluidity, and, as, signaling, molecules, examples, include, the, lipid, cholesterol, sex, hormones, estradiol, and, testosterone, 10, 19, anabolic, steroids, and, the, anti, inflammatory, corticosteroid, drug, dexamethasone, hundreds, of, steroids, are, found, in, fungi, plants, and, animals, all, steroids, are, manufactured, in, cells, from, the, sterols, lanosterol, opisthokonts, or, cycloartenol, plants, lanosterol, and, cycloartenol, are, derived, from, the, cyclization, of, the, triterpene, squalene, steroids, are, named, after, the, steroid, cholesterol, which, was, first, described, in, gall, stones, from, ancient, greek, chole, bile, and, stereos, solid, the, steroid, nucleus, core, structure, is, called, gonane, cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene, it, is, typically, composed, of, seventeen, carbon, atoms, bonded, in, four, fused, rings, three, six, member, cyclohexane, rings, rings, a, b, and, c, in, the, first, illustration, and, one, five, member, cyclopentane, ring, the, d, ring, steroids, vary, by, the, functional, groups, attached, to, this, four, ring, core, and, by, the, oxidation, state, of, the, rings, sterols, are, forms, of, steroids, with, a, hydroxy, group, at, position, three, and, a, skeleton, derived, from, cholestane, 1785f, steroids, can, also, be, more, radically, modified, such, as, by, changes, to, the, ring, structure, for, example, cutting, one, of, the, rings, cutting, ring, b, produces, secosteroids, one, of, which, is, vitamin, d, 3, gonane, also, known, as, steran, or, cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene, the, simplest, steroid, and, the, nucleus, of, all, steroids, and, sterols, is, composed, of, seventeen, carbon, atoms, in, carbon, carbon, bonds, forming, four, fused, rings, in, a, three, dimensional, shape, the, three, cyclohexane, rings, a, b, and, c, in, the, first, illustration, form, the, skeleton, of, a, perhydro, derivative, of, phenanthrene, the, d, ring, has, a, cyclopentane, structure, when, the, two, methyl, groups, and, eight, carbon, side, chains, at, c, 17, as, shown, for, cholesterol, are, present, the, steroid, is, said, to, have, a, cholestane, framework, the, two, common, 5, and, 5, stereoisomeric, forms, of, steroids, exist, because, of, differences, in, the, side, of, the, largely, planar, ring, system, where, the, hydrogen, h, atom, at, carbon, 5, is, attached, which, results, in, a, change, in, steroid, a, ring, conformation, isomerisation, at, the, c, 21, side, chain, produces, a, parallel, series, of, compounds, referred, to, as, isosteroids, examples, of, steroid, structures, are, in, addition, to, the, ring, scissions, cleavages, expansions, and, contractions, cleavage, and, reclosing, to, a, larger, or, smaller, rings, all, variations, in, the, carbon, carbon, bond, framework, steroids, can, also, vary, for, instance, sterols, such, as, cholesterol, and, lanosterol, have, a, hydroxyl, group, attached, at, position, c, 3, while, testosterone, and, progesterone, have, a, carbonyl, oxo, substituent, at, c, 3, among, these, compounds, only, lanosterol, has, two, methyl, groups, at, c, 4, cholesterol, which, has, a, c, 5, to, c, 6, double, bond, differs, from, testosterone, and, progesterone, which, have, a, c, 4, to, c, 5, double, bond, almost, all, biologically, relevant, steroids, can, be, presented, as, a, derivative, of, a, parent, cholesterol, like, hydrocarbon, structure, that, serves, as, a, skeleton, these, parent, structures, have, specific, names, such, as, pregnane, androstane, etc, the, derivatives, carry, various, functional, groups, called, suffixes, or, prefixes, after, the, respective, numbers, indicating, their, position, in, the, steroid, nucleus, there, are, widely, used, trivial, steroid, names, of, natural, origin, with, significant, biologic, activity, such, as, progesterone, testosterone, or, cortisol, some, of, these, names, are, defined, in, the, nomenclature, of, steroids, these, trivial, names, can, also, be, used, as, a, base, to, derive, new, names, however, by, adding, prefixes, only, rather, than, suffixes, e, g, the, steroid, 17, hydroxyprogesterone, has, a, hydroxy, group, oh, at, position, 17, of, the, steroid, nucleus, comparing, to, progesterone, the, letters, and, denote, absolute, stereochemistry, at, chiral, centers, a, specific, nomenclature, distinct, from, the, r, s, convention, of, organic, chemistry, to, denote, absolute, configuration, of, functional, groups, known, as, cahn, ingold, prelog, priority, rules, the, r, s, convention, assigns, priorities, to, substituents, on, a, chiral, center, based, on, their, atomic, number, the, highest, priority, group, is, assigned, to, the, atom, with, the, highest, atomic, number, and, the, lowest, priority, group, is, assigned, to, the, atom, with, the, lowest, atomic, number, the, molecule, is, then, oriented, so, that, the, lowest, priority, group, points, away, from, the, viewer, and, the, remaining, three, groups, are, arranged, in, order, of, decreasing, priority, around, the, chiral, center, if, this, arrangement, is, clockwise, it, is, assigned, an, r, configuration, if, it, is, counterclockwise, it, is, assigned, an, s, configuration, in, contrast, steroid, nomenclature, uses, and, to, denote, stereochemistry, at, chiral, centers, the, and, designations, are, based, on, the, orientation, of, substituents, relative, to, each, other, in, a, specific, ring, system, in, general, refers, to, a, substituent, that, is, oriented, towards, the, plane, of, the, ring, system, while, refers, to, a, substituent, that, is, oriented, away, from, the, plane, of, the, ring, system, in, steroids, drawn, from, the, standard, perspective, used, in, this, paper, bonds, are, depicted, on, figures, as, dashed, wedges, and, bonds, as, solid, wedges, the, name, 11, deoxycortisol, is, an, example, of, a, derived, name, that, uses, cortisol, as, a, parent, structure, without, an, oxygen, atom, hence, deoxy, attached, to, position, 11, as, a, part, of, a, hydroxy, group, the, numbering, of, positions, of, carbon, atoms, in, the, steroid, nucleus, is, set, in, a, template, found, in, the, nomenclature, of, steroids, that, is, used, regardless, of, whether, an, atom, is, present, in, the, steroid, in, question, unsaturated, carbons, generally, ones, that, are, part, of, a, double, bond, in, the, steroid, nucleus, are, indicated, by, changing, ane, to, ene, this, change, was, traditionally, done, in, the, parent, name, adding, a, prefix, to, denote, the, position, with, or, without, greek, capital, delta, which, designates, unsaturation, for, example, 4, pregnene, 11, 17, diol, 3, 20, dione, also, 4, pregnene, 11, 17, diol, 3, 20, dione, or, 4, androstene, 3, 11, 17, trione, also, 4, androstene, 3, 11, 17, trione, however, the, nomenclature, of, steroids, recommends, the, locant, of, a, double, bond, to, be, always, adjacent, to, the, syllable, designating, the, unsaturation, therefore, having, it, as, a, suffix, rather, than, a, prefix, and, without, the, use, of, the, character, i, e, pregn, 4, ene, 11, 17, diol, 3, 20, dione, or, androst, 4, ene, 3, 11, 17, trione, the, double, bond, is, designated, by, the, lower, numbered, carbon, atom, i, e, 4, or, 4, ene, means, the, double, bond, between, positions, 4, and, 5, the, saturation, of, carbons, of, a, parent, steroid, can, be, done, by, adding, dihydro, prefix, i, e, a, saturation, of, carbons, 4, and, 5, of, testosterone, with, two, hydrogen, atoms, is, 4, 5, dihydrotestosterone, or, 4, 5, dihydrotestosterone, generally, when, there, is, no, ambiguity, one, number, of, a, hydrogen, position, from, a, steroid, with, a, saturated, bond, may, be, omitted, leaving, only, the, position, of, the, second, hydrogen, atom, e, g, 5, dihydrotestosterone, or, 5, dihydrotestosterone, the, 5, steroids, are, those, with, a, double, bond, between, carbons, 5, and, 6, and, the, 4, steroids, are, those, with, a, double, bond, between, carbons, 4, and, 5, the, abbreviations, like, p4, for, progesterone, and, a4, for, androstenedione, for, refer, to, 4, steroids, while, p5, for, pregnenolone, and, a5, for, androstenediol, refer, to, 5, steroids, the, suffix, ol, denotes, a, hydroxy, group, while, the, suffix, one, denotes, an, oxo, group, when, two, or, three, identical, groups, are, attached, to, the, base, structure, at, different, positions, the, suffix, is, indicated, as, diol, or, triol, for, hydroxy, and, dione, or, trione, for, oxo, groups, respectively, for, example, 5, pregnane, 3, 17, diol, 20, one, has, a, hydrogen, atom, at, the, 5, position, hence, the, 5, prefix, two, hydroxy, groups, oh, at, the, 3, and, 17, positions, hence, 3, 17, diol, suffix, and, an, oxo, group, o, at, the, position, 20, hence, the, 20, one, suffix, however, erroneous, use, of, suffixes, can, be, found, e, g, 5, pregnan, 17, diol, 3, 11, 20, trione, since, it, has, just, one, hydroxy, group, at, 17, rather, than, two, then, the, suffix, should, be, ol, rather, than, diol, so, that, the, correct, name, to, be, 5, pregnan, 17, ol, 3, 11, 20, trione, according, to, the, rule, set, in, the, nomenclature, of, steroids, the, terminal, e, in, the, parent, structure, name, should, be, elided, before, the, vowel, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, number, does, not, affect, such, elision, this, means, for, instance, that, if, the, suffix, immediately, appended, to, the, parent, structure, name, begins, with, a, vowel, the, trailing, e, is, removed, from, that, name, an, example, of, such, removal, is, 5, pregnan, 17, ol, 3, 20, dione, where, the, last, e, of, pregnane, is, dropped, due, to, the, vowel, o, at, the, beginning, of, the, suffix, ol, some, authors, incorrectly, use, this, rule, eliding, the, terminal, e, where, it, should, be, kept, or, vice, versa, the, term, 11, oxygenated, refers, to, the, presence, of, an, oxygen, atom, as, an, oxo, o, or, hydroxy, oh, substituent, at, carbon, 11, oxygenated, is, consistently, used, within, the, chemistry, of, the, steroids, since, the, 1950s, some, studies, use, the, term, 11, oxyandrogens, as, an, abbreviation, for, 11, oxygenated, androgens, to, emphasize, that, they, all, have, an, oxygen, atom, attached, to, carbon, at, position, 11, however, in, chemical, nomenclature, the, prefix, oxy, is, associated, with, ether, functional, groups, i, e, a, compound, with, an, oxygen, atom, connected, to, two, alkyl, or, aryl, groups, r, o, r, therefore, using, oxy, within, the, name, of, a, steroid, class, may, be, misleading, one, can, find, clear, examples, of, oxygenated, to, refer, to, a, broad, class, of, organic, molecules, containing, a, variety, of, oxygen, containing, functional, groups, in, other, domains, of, organic, chemistry, and, it, is, appropriate, to, use, this, convention, even, though, keto, is, a, standard, prefix, in, organic, chemistry, the, 1989, recommendations, of, the, joint, commission, on, biochemical, nomenclature, discourage, the, application, of, the, prefix, keto, for, steroid, names, and, favor, the, prefix, oxo, e, g, 11, oxo, steroids, rather, than, 11, keto, steroids, because, keto, includes, the, carbon, that, is, part, of, the, steroid, nucleus, and, the, same, carbon, atom, should, not, be, specified, twice, steroids, are, found, in, all, domains, of, life, including, bacteria, archaea, and, eukaryotes, in, eukaryotes, steroids, are, found, in, fungi, plants, and, animals, eukaryotic, cells, which, include, animals, plants, fungi, and, protists, have, complex, cellular, structures, with, a, true, nucleus, and, membrane, bound, organelles, steroids, are, integral, to, eukaryotic, cellular, membranes, where, they, help, maintain, membrane, integrity, and, function, during, eukaryogenesis, the, emergence, of, modern, eukaryotic, cells, steroids, likely, played, a, role, in, the, acquisition, of, mitochondria, via, endocytosis, in, prokaryotes, biosynthetic, pathways, exist, for, the, tetracyclic, steroid, framework, e, g, in, myxobacteria, where, its, origin, from, eukaryotes, is, conjectured, and, the, more, common, pentacyclic, triterpinoid, hopanoid, framework, fungal, steroids, include, the, ergosterols, which, are, involved, in, maintaining, the, integrity, of, the, fungal, cellular, membrane, various, antifungal, drugs, such, as, amphotericin, b, and, azole, antifungals, utilize, this, information, to, kill, pathogenic, fungi, fungi, can, alter, their, ergosterol, content, e, g, through, loss, of, function, mutations, in, the, enzymes, erg3, or, erg6, inducing, depletion, of, ergosterol, or, mutations, that, decrease, the, ergosterol, content, to, develop, resistance, to, drugs, that, target, ergosterol, ergosterol, is, analogous, to, the, cholesterol, found, in, the, cellular, membranes, of, animals, including, humans, or, the, phytosterols, found, in, the, cellular, membranes, of, plants, all, mushrooms, contain, large, quantities, of, ergosterol, in, the, range, of, tens, to, hundreds, of, milligrams, per, 100, grams, of, dry, weight, oxygen, is, necessary, for, the, synthesis, of, ergosterol, in, fungi, ergosterol, is, responsible, for, the, vitamin, d, content, found, in, mushrooms, ergosterol, is, chemically, converted, into, provitamin, d2, by, exposure, to, ultraviolet, light, provitamin, d2, spontaneously, forms, vitamin, d2, however, not, all, fungi, utilize, ergosterol, in, their, cellular, membranes, for, example, the, pathogenic, fungal, species, pneumocystis, jirovecii, does, not, which, has, important, clinical, implications, given, the, mechanism, of, action, of, many, antifungal, drugs, using, the, fungus, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, as, an, example, other, major, steroids, include, ergosta, 5, 7, 22, 24, 28, tetraen, 3, ol, zymosterol, and, lanosterol, s, cerevisiae, utilizes, 5, 6, dihydroergosterol, in, place, of, ergosterol, in, its, cell, membrane, plant, steroids, include, steroidal, alkaloids, found, in, solanaceae, and, melanthiaceae, specially, the, genus, veratrum, cardiac, glycosides, the, phytosterols, and, the, brassinosteroids, which, include, several, plant, hormones, animal, steroids, include, compounds, of, vertebrate, and, insect, origin, the, latter, including, ecdysteroids, such, as, ecdysterone, controlling, molting, in, some, species, vertebrate, examples, include, the, steroid, hormones, and, cholesterol, the, latter, is, a, structural, component, of, cell, membranes, that, helps, determine, the, fluidity, of, cell, membranes, and, is, a, principal, constituent, of, plaque, implicated, in, atherosclerosis, steroid, hormones, include, the, major, classes, of, steroid, hormones, with, prominent, members, and, examples, of, related, functions, are, additional, classes, of, steroids, include, as, well, as, the, following, class, of, secosteroids, open, ring, steroids, steroids, can, be, classified, based, on, their, chemical, composition, one, example, of, how, mesh, performs, this, classification, is, available, at, the, wikipedia, mesh, catalog, examples, of, this, classification, include, in, biology, it, is, common, to, name, the, above, steroid, classes, by, the, number, of, carbon, atoms, present, when, referring, to, hormones, c, 18, steroids, for, the, estranes, mostly, estrogens, c, 19, steroids, for, the, androstanes, mostly, androgens, and, c, 21, steroids, for, the, pregnanes, mostly, corticosteroids, the, classification, 17, ketosteroid, is, also, important, in, medicine, the, gonane, steroid, nucleus, is, the, parent, 17, carbon, tetracyclic, hydrocarbon, molecule, with, no, alkyl, sidechains, secosteroids, latin, seco, to, cut, are, a, subclass, of, steroidal, compounds, resulting, biosynthetically, or, conceptually, from, scission, cleavage, of, parent, steroid, rings, generally, one, of, the, four, major, secosteroid, subclasses, are, defined, by, the, steroid, carbon, atoms, where, this, scission, has, taken, place, for, instance, the, prototypical, secosteroid, cholecalciferol, vitamin, d, 3, shown, is, in, the, 9, 10, secosteroid, subclass, and, derives, from, the, cleavage, of, carbon, atoms, c, 9, and, c, 10, of, the, steroid, b, ring, 5, 6, secosteroids, and, 13, 14, steroids, are, similar, norsteroids, nor, l, norma, normal, in, chemistry, indicating, carbon, removal, and, homosteroids, homo, greek, homos, same, indicating, carbon, addition, are, structural, subclasses, of, steroids, formed, from, biosynthetic, steps, the, former, involves, enzymic, ring, expansion, contraction, reactions, and, the, latter, is, accomplished, biomimetically, or, more, frequently, through, ring, closures, of, acyclic, precursors, with, more, or, fewer, ring, atoms, than, the, parent, steroid, framework, combinations, of, these, ring, alterations, are, known, in, nature, for, instance, ewes, who, graze, on, corn, lily, ingest, cyclopamine, shown, and, veratramine, two, of, a, sub, family, of, steroids, where, the, c, and, d, rings, are, contracted, and, expanded, respectively, via, a, biosynthetic, migration, of, the, original, c, 13, atom, ingestion, of, these, c, nor, d, homosteroids, results, in, birth, defects, in, lambs, cyclopia, from, cyclopamine, and, leg, deformity, from, veratramine, a, further, c, nor, d, homosteroid, nakiterpiosin, is, excreted, by, okinawan, cyanobacteriosponges, e, g, terpios, hoshinota, leading, to, coral, mortality, from, black, coral, disease, nakiterpiosin, type, steroids, are, active, against, the, signaling, pathway, involving, the, smoothened, and, hedgehog, proteins, a, pathway, which, is, hyperactive, in, a, number, of, cancers, steroids, and, their, metabolites, often, function, as, signalling, molecules, the, most, notable, examples, are, steroid, hormones, and, steroids, and, phospholipids, are, components, of, cell, membranes, steroids, such, as, cholesterol, decrease, membrane, fluidity, similar, to, lipids, steroids, are, highly, concentrated, energy, stores, however, they, are, not, typically, sources, of, energy, in, mammals, they, are, normally, metabolized, and, excreted, steroids, play, critical, roles, in, a, number, of, disorders, including, malignancies, like, prostate, cancer, where, steroid, production, inside, and, outside, the, tumour, promotes, cancer, cell, aggressiveness, the, hundreds, of, steroids, found, in, animals, fungi, and, plants, are, made, from, lanosterol, in, animals, and, fungi, see, examples, above, or, cycloartenol, in, other, eukaryotes, both, lanosterol, and, cycloartenol, derive, from, cyclization, of, the, triterpenoid, squalene, lanosterol, and, cycloartenol, are, sometimes, called, protosterols, because, they, serve, as, the, starting, compounds, for, all, other, steroids, steroid, biosynthesis, is, an, anabolic, pathway, which, produces, steroids, from, simple, precursors, a, unique, biosynthetic, pathway, is, followed, in, animals, compared, to, many, other, organisms, making, the, pathway, a, common, target, for, antibiotics, and, other, anti, infection, drugs, steroid, metabolism, in, humans, is, also, the, target, of, cholesterol, lowering, drugs, such, as, statins, in, humans, and, other, animals, the, biosynthesis, of, steroids, follows, the, mevalonate, pathway, which, uses, acetyl, coa, as, building, blocks, for, dimethylallyl, diphosphate, dmapp, and, isopentenyl, diphosphate, ipp, in, subsequent, steps, dmapp, and, ipp, conjugate, to, form, farnesyl, diphosphate, fpp, which, further, conjugates, with, each, other, to, form, the, linear, triterpenoid, squalene, squalene, biosynthesis, is, catalyzed, by, squalene, synthase, which, belongs, to, the, squalene, phytoene, synthase, family, subsequent, epoxidation, and, cyclization, of, squalene, generate, lanosterol, which, is, the, starting, point, for, additional, modifications, into, other, steroids, steroidogenesis, in, other, eukaryotes, the, cyclization, product, of, epoxidized, squalene, oxidosqualene, is, cycloartenol, the, mevalonate, pathway, also, called, hmg, coa, reductase, pathway, begins, with, acetyl, coa, and, ends, with, dimethylallyl, diphosphate, dmapp, and, isopentenyl, diphosphate, ipp, dmapp, and, ipp, donate, isoprene, units, which, are, assembled, and, modified, to, form, terpenes, and, isoprenoids, a, large, class, of, lipids, which, include, the, carotenoids, and, form, the, largest, class, of, plant, natural, products, here, the, isoprene, units, are, joined, to, make, squalene, and, folded, into, a, set, of, rings, to, make, lanosterol, lanosterol, can, then, be, converted, into, other, steroids, such, as, cholesterol, and, ergosterol, two, classes, of, drugs, target, the, mevalonate, pathway, statins, like, rosuvastatin, which, are, used, to, reduce, elevated, cholesterol, levels, and, bisphosphonates, like, zoledronate, which, are, used, to, treat, a, number, of, bone, degenerative, diseases, steroidogenesis, is, the, biological, process, by, which, steroids, are, generated, from, cholesterol, and, changed, into, other, steroids, the, pathways, of, steroidogenesis, differ, among, species, the, major, classes, of, steroid, hormones, as, noted, above, with, their, prominent, members, and, functions, are, the, progestogens, corticosteroids, corticoids, androgens, and, estrogens, human, steroidogenesis, of, these, classes, occurs, in, a, number, of, locations, in, plants, and, bacteria, the, non, mevalonate, pathway, mep, pathway, uses, pyruvate, and, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, as, substrates, to, produce, ipp, and, dmapp, during, diseases, pathways, otherwise, not, significant, in, healthy, humans, can, become, utilized, for, example, in, one, form, of, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, a, deficiency, in, the, 21, hydroxylase, enzymatic, pathway, leads, to, an, excess, of, 17, hydroxyprogesterone, 17, ohp, this, pathological, excess, of, 17, ohp, in, turn, may, be, converted, to, dihydrotestosterone, dht, a, potent, androgen, through, among, others, 17, 20, lyase, a, member, of, the, cytochrome, p450, family, of, enzymes, 5, reductase, and, 3, hydroxysteroid, dehydrogenase, steroids, are, primarily, oxidized, by, cytochrome, p450, oxidase, enzymes, such, as, cyp3a4, these, reactions, introduce, oxygen, into, the, steroid, ring, allowing, the, cholesterol, to, be, broken, up, by, other, enzymes, into, bile, acids, these, acids, can, then, be, eliminated, by, secretion, from, the, liver, in, bile, the, expression, of, the, oxidase, gene, can, be, upregulated, by, the, steroid, sensor, pxr, when, there, is, a, high, blood, concentration, of, steroids, steroid, hormones, lacking, the, side, chain, of, cholesterol, and, bile, acids, are, typically, hydroxylated, at, various, ring, positions, or, oxidized, at, the, 17, position, conjugated, with, sulfate, or, glucuronic, acid, and, excreted, in, the, urine, steroid, isolation, depending, on, context, is, the, isolation, of, chemical, matter, required, for, chemical, structure, elucidation, derivitzation, or, degradation, chemistry, biological, testing, and, other, research, needs, generally, milligrams, to, grams, but, often, more, or, the, isolation, of, analytical, quantities, of, the, substance, of, interest, where, the, focus, is, on, identifying, and, quantifying, the, substance, for, example, in, biological, tissue, or, fluid, the, amount, isolated, depends, on, the, analytical, method, but, is, generally, less, than, one, microgram, the, methods, of, isolation, to, achieve, the, two, scales, of, product, are, distinct, but, include, extraction, precipitation, adsorption, chromatography, and, crystallization, in, both, cases, the, isolated, substance, is, purified, to, chemical, homogeneity, combined, separation, and, analytical, methods, such, as, lc, ms, are, chosen, to, be, orthogonal, achieving, their, separations, based, on, distinct, modes, of, interaction, between, substance, and, isolating, matrix, to, detect, a, single, species, in, the, pure, sample, structure, determination, refers, to, the, methods, to, determine, the, chemical, structure, of, an, isolated, pure, steroid, using, an, evolving, array, of, chemical, and, physical, methods, which, have, included, nmr, and, small, molecule, crystallography, 10, 19, methods, of, analysis, overlap, both, of, the, above, areas, emphasizing, analytical, methods, to, determining, if, a, steroid, is, present, in, a, mixture, and, determining, its, quantity, microbial, catabolism, of, phytosterol, side, chains, yields, c, 19, steroids, c, 22, steroids, and, 17, ketosteroids, i, e, precursors, to, adrenocortical, hormones, and, contraceptives, the, addition, and, modification, of, functional, groups, is, key, when, producing, the, wide, variety, of, medications, available, within, this, chemical, classification, these, modifications, are, performed, using, conventional, organic, synthesis, and, or, biotransformation, techniques, the, semisynthesis, of, steroids, often, begins, from, precursors, such, as, cholesterol, phytosterols, or, sapogenins, the, efforts, of, syntex, a, company, involved, in, the, mexican, barbasco, trade, used, dioscorea, mexicana, to, produce, the, sapogenin, diosgenin, in, the, early, days, of, the, synthetic, steroid, pharmaceutical, industry, some, steroidal, hormones, are, economically, obtained, only, by, total, synthesis, from, petrochemicals, e, g, 13, alkyl, steroids, for, example, the, pharmaceutical, norgestrel, begins, from, methoxy, 1, tetralone, a, petrochemical, derived, from, phenol, a, number, of, nobel, prizes, have, been, awarded, for, steroid, research, including
