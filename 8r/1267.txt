an, emergency, department, ed, also, known, as, an, accident, and, emergency, department, a, e, emergency, room, er, emergency, ward, ew, or, casualty, department, is, a, medical, treatment, facility, specializing, in, emergency, medicine, the, acute, care, of, patients, who, present, without, prior, appointment, either, by, their, own, means, or, by, that, of, an, ambulance, the, emergency, department, is, usually, found, in, a, hospital, or, other, primary, care, center, due, to, the, unplanned, nature, of, patient, attendance, the, department, must, provide, initial, treatment, for, a, broad, spectrum, of, illnesses, and, injuries, some, of, which, may, be, life, threatening, and, require, immediate, attention, in, some, countries, emergency, departments, have, become, important, entry, points, for, those, without, other, means, of, access, to, medical, care, the, emergency, departments, of, most, hospitals, operate, 24, hours, a, day, although, staffing, levels, may, be, varied, in, an, attempt, to, reflect, patient, volume, accident, services, were, provided, by, workmen, s, compensation, plans, railway, companies, and, municipalities, in, europe, and, the, united, states, by, the, late, mid, nineteenth, century, but, the, world, s, first, specialized, trauma, care, center, was, opened, in, 1911, in, the, united, states, at, the, university, of, louisville, hospital, in, louisville, kentucky, it, was, further, developed, in, the, 1930s, by, surgeon, arnold, griswold, who, also, equipped, police, and, fire, vehicles, with, medical, supplies, and, trained, officers, to, give, emergency, care, while, en, route, to, the, hospital, today, a, typical, hospital, has, its, emergency, department, in, its, own, section, of, the, ground, floor, of, the, grounds, with, its, own, dedicated, entrance, as, patients, can, arrive, at, any, time, and, with, any, complaint, a, key, part, of, the, operation, of, an, emergency, department, is, the, prioritization, of, cases, based, on, clinical, need, this, process, is, called, triage, triage, is, normally, the, first, stage, the, patient, passes, through, and, consists, of, a, brief, assessment, including, a, set, of, vital, signs, and, the, assignment, of, a, chief, complaint, e, g, chest, pain, abdominal, pain, difficulty, breathing, etc, most, emergency, departments, have, a, dedicated, area, for, this, process, to, take, place, and, may, have, staff, dedicated, to, performing, nothing, but, a, triage, role, in, most, departments, this, role, is, fulfilled, by, a, triage, nurse, although, dependent, on, training, levels, in, the, country, and, area, other, health, care, professionals, may, perform, the, triage, sorting, including, paramedics, and, physicians, triage, is, typically, conducted, face, to, face, when, the, patient, presents, or, a, form, of, triage, may, be, conducted, via, radio, with, an, ambulance, crew, in, this, method, the, paramedics, will, call, the, hospital, s, triage, center, with, a, short, update, about, an, incoming, patient, who, will, then, be, triaged, to, the, appropriate, level, of, care, most, patients, will, be, initially, assessed, at, triage, and, then, passed, to, another, area, of, the, department, or, another, area, of, the, hospital, with, their, waiting, time, determined, by, their, clinical, need, however, some, patients, may, complete, their, treatment, at, the, triage, stage, for, instance, if, the, condition, is, very, minor, and, can, be, treated, quickly, if, only, advice, is, required, or, if, the, emergency, department, is, not, a, suitable, point, of, care, for, the, patient, conversely, patients, with, evidently, serious, conditions, such, as, cardiac, arrest, will, bypass, triage, altogether, and, move, straight, to, the, appropriate, part, of, the, department, the, resuscitation, area, commonly, referred, to, as, trauma, or, resus, is, a, key, area, in, most, departments, the, most, seriously, ill, or, injured, patients, will, be, dealt, with, in, this, area, as, it, contains, the, equipment, and, staff, required, for, dealing, with, immediately, life, threatening, illnesses, and, injuries, in, such, situations, the, time, in, which, the, patient, is, treated, is, crucial, typical, resuscitation, staffing, involves, at, least, one, attending, physician, and, at, least, one, and, usually, two, nurses, with, trauma, and, advanced, cardiac, life, support, training, these, personnel, may, be, assigned, to, the, resuscitation, area, for, the, entirety, of, the, shift, or, may, be, on, call, for, resuscitation, coverage, i, e, if, a, critical, case, presents, via, walk, in, triage, or, ambulance, the, team, will, be, paged, to, the, resuscitation, area, to, deal, with, the, case, immediately, resuscitation, cases, may, also, be, attended, by, residents, radiographers, ambulance, personnel, respiratory, therapists, hospital, pharmacists, and, students, of, any, of, these, professions, depending, upon, the, skill, mix, needed, for, any, given, case, and, whether, or, not, the, hospital, provides, teaching, services, patients, who, exhibit, signs, of, being, seriously, ill, but, are, not, in, immediate, danger, of, life, or, limb, will, be, triaged, to, acute, care, or, majors, where, they, will, be, seen, by, a, physician, and, receive, a, more, thorough, assessment, and, treatment, examples, of, majors, include, chest, pain, difficulty, breathing, abdominal, pain, and, neurological, complaints, advanced, diagnostic, testing, may, be, conducted, at, this, stage, including, laboratory, testing, of, blood, and, or, urine, ultrasonography, ct, or, mri, scanning, medications, appropriate, to, manage, the, patient, s, condition, will, also, be, given, depending, on, underlying, causes, of, the, patient, s, chief, complaint, he, or, she, may, be, discharged, home, from, this, area, or, admitted, to, the, hospital, for, further, treatment, patients, whose, condition, is, not, immediately, life, threatening, will, be, sent, to, an, area, suitable, to, deal, with, them, and, these, areas, might, typically, be, termed, as, a, prompt, care, or, minors, area, such, patients, may, still, have, been, found, to, have, significant, problems, including, fractures, dislocations, and, lacerations, requiring, suturing, children, can, present, particular, challenges, in, treatment, some, departments, have, dedicated, pediatrics, areas, and, some, departments, employ, a, play, therapist, whose, job, is, to, put, children, at, ease, to, reduce, the, anxiety, caused, by, visiting, the, emergency, department, as, well, as, provide, distraction, therapy, for, simple, procedures, many, hospitals, have, a, separate, area, for, evaluation, of, psychiatric, problems, these, are, often, staffed, by, psychiatrists, and, mental, health, nurses, and, social, workers, there, is, typically, at, least, one, room, for, people, who, are, actively, a, risk, to, themselves, or, others, e, g, suicidal, fast, decisions, on, life, and, death, cases, are, critical, in, hospital, emergency, departments, as, a, result, doctors, face, great, pressures, to, overtest, and, overtreat, the, fear, of, missing, something, often, leads, to, extra, blood, tests, and, imaging, scans, for, what, may, be, harmless, chest, pains, run, of, the, mill, head, bumps, and, non, threatening, stomach, aches, with, a, high, cost, on, the, health, care, system, emergency, department, became, commonly, used, when, emergency, medicine, was, recognized, as, a, medical, specialty, and, hospitals, and, medical, centres, developed, departments, of, emergency, medicine, to, provide, services, other, common, variations, include, emergency, ward, emergency, centre, or, emergency, unit, accident, and, emergency, a, e, is, deprecated, in, the, united, kingdom, but, still, in, common, parlance, it, is, also, still, in, use, in, hong, kong, earlier, terms, such, as, casualty, or, casualty, department, were, previously, used, officially, and, continue, to, be, used, informally, the, same, applies, to, emergency, room, emerg, or, er, in, north, america, originating, when, emergency, facilities, were, provided, in, a, single, room, of, the, hospital, by, the, department, of, surgery, regardless, of, naming, convention, there, is, a, widespread, usage, of, directional, signage, in, white, text, on, a, red, background, across, the, world, which, indicates, the, location, of, the, emergency, department, or, a, hospital, with, such, facilities, signs, on, emergency, departments, may, contain, additional, information, in, some, american, states, there, is, close, regulation, of, the, design, and, content, of, such, signs, for, example, california, requires, wording, such, as, comprehensive, emergency, medical, service, and, physician, on, duty, to, prevent, persons, in, need, of, critical, care, from, presenting, to, facilities, that, are, not, fully, equipped, and, staffed, in, some, countries, including, the, united, states, and, canada, a, smaller, facility, that, may, provide, assistance, in, medical, emergencies, is, known, as, a, clinic, larger, communities, often, have, walk, in, clinics, where, people, with, medical, problems, that, would, not, be, considered, serious, enough, to, warrant, an, emergency, department, visit, can, be, seen, these, clinics, often, do, not, operate, on, a, 24, hour, basis, very, large, clinics, may, operate, as, free, standing, emergency, centres, which, are, open, 24, hours, and, can, manage, a, very, large, number, of, conditions, however, if, a, patient, presents, to, a, free, standing, clinic, with, a, condition, requiring, hospital, admission, he, or, she, must, be, transferred, to, an, actual, hospital, as, these, facilities, do, not, have, the, capability, to, provide, inpatient, care, the, centers, for, medicare, and, medicaid, services, cms, classified, emergency, departments, into, two, types, type, a, the, majority, which, are, open, 24, hours, a, day, 7, days, a, week, 365, days, a, year, and, those, who, are, not, type, b, many, us, emergency, departments, are, exceedingly, busy, a, study, found, that, in, 2009, there, were, an, estimated, 128, 885, 040, ed, encounters, in, us, hospitals, approximately, one, fifth, of, ed, visits, in, 2010, were, for, patients, under, the, age, of, 18, years, in, 2009, 2010, a, total, of, 19, 6, million, emergency, department, visits, in, the, united, states, were, made, by, persons, aged, 65, and, over, most, encounters, 82, 8, percent, resulted, in, treatment, and, release, 17, 2, percent, were, admitted, to, inpatient, care, the, 1986, emergency, medical, treatment, and, active, labor, act, is, an, act, of, the, united, states, congress, that, requires, emergency, departments, if, the, associated, hospital, receives, payments, from, medicare, to, provide, appropriate, medical, examination, and, emergency, treatment, to, all, individuals, seeking, treatment, for, a, medical, condition, regardless, of, citizenship, legal, status, or, ability, to, pay, like, an, unfunded, mandate, there, are, no, reimbursement, provisions, rates, of, ed, visits, rose, between, 2006, and, 2011, for, almost, every, patient, characteristic, and, location, the, total, rate, of, ed, visits, increased, 4, 5, in, that, time, however, the, rate, of, visits, for, patients, under, one, year, of, age, declined, 8, 3, a, survey, of, new, york, area, doctors, in, february, 2007, found, that, injuries, and, even, deaths, have, been, caused, by, excessive, waits, for, hospital, beds, by, ed, patients, a, 2005, patient, survey, found, an, average, ed, wait, time, from, 2, 3, hours, in, iowa, to, 5, 0, hours, in, arizona, one, inspection, of, los, angeles, area, hospitals, by, congressional, staff, found, the, eds, operating, at, an, average, of, 116, of, capacity, meaning, there, were, more, patients, than, available, treatment, spaces, with, insufficient, beds, to, accommodate, victims, of, a, terrorist, attack, the, size, of, the, 2004, madrid, train, bombings, three, of, the, five, level, i, trauma, centres, were, on, diversion, meaning, ambulances, with, all, but, the, most, severely, injured, patients, were, being, directed, elsewhere, because, the, ed, could, not, safely, accommodate, any, more, patients, this, controversial, practice, was, banned, in, massachusetts, except, for, major, incidents, such, as, a, fire, in, the, ed, effective, 1, january, 2009, in, response, hospitals, have, devoted, more, staff, to, the, ed, at, peak, times, and, moved, some, elective, procedures, to, non, peak, times, in, 2009, there, were, 1, 800, eds, in, the, country, in, 2011, about, 421, out, of, every, 1, 000, people, in, the, united, states, visited, the, emergency, department, five, times, as, many, were, discharged, as, were, admitted, rural, areas, are, the, highest, rate, of, ed, visits, 502, per, 1, 000, population, and, large, metro, counties, had, the, lowest, 319, visits, per, 1, 000, population, by, region, the, midwest, had, the, highest, rate, of, ed, visits, 460, per, 1, 000, population, and, western, states, had, the, lowest, 321, visits, per, 1, 000, population, in, addition, to, the, normal, hospital, based, emergency, departments, a, trend, has, developed, in, some, states, including, texas, and, colorado, of, emergency, departments, not, attached, to, hospitals, these, new, emergency, departments, are, referred, to, as, free, standing, emergency, departments, the, rationale, for, these, operations, is, the, ability, to, operate, outside, of, hospital, policies, that, may, lead, to, increased, wait, times, and, reduced, patient, satisfaction, these, departments, have, attracted, controversy, due, to, consumer, confusion, around, their, prices, and, insurance, coverage, in, 2017, the, largest, operator, adeptus, health, declared, bankruptcy, patients, may, visit, the, emergency, room, for, non, emergencies, which, typically, costs, the, patient, and, the, managed, care, insurance, company, more, and, therefore, the, insurance, company, may, apply, utilization, management, to, deny, coverage, in, 2004, a, study, found, that, emergency, room, visits, were, the, most, common, reason, for, appealing, disputes, over, coverage, after, receiving, service, in, 2017, anthem, expanded, this, denial, coverage, more, broadly, provoking, public, policy, reactions, all, accident, and, emergency, a, e, departments, throughout, the, united, kingdom, are, financed, and, managed, publicly, by, the, national, health, service, nhs, of, each, constituent, country, england, scotland, wales, and, northern, ireland, the, term, a, e, is,

criterion, details, on, charges, vary, from, country, to, country, in, england, departments, are, divided, into, three, categories, historically, waits, for, assessment, in, a, e, were, very, long, in, some, areas, of, the, uk, in, october, 2002, the, department, of, health, introduced, a, four, hour, target, in, emergency, departments, that, required, departments, in, england, to, assess, and, treat, patients, within, four, hours, of, arrival, with, referral, and, assessment, by, other, departments, if, deemed, necessary, it, was, expected, that, the, patients, would, have, physically, left, the, department, within, the, four, hours, present, policy, is, that, 95, of, all, patient, cases, do, not, breach, this, four, hour, wait, the, busiest, departments, in, the, uk, outside, london, include, university, hospital, of, wales, in, cardiff, the, north, wales, regional, hospital, in, wrexham, the, royal, infirmary, of, edinburgh, and, queen, alexandra, hospital, in, portsmouth, in, july, 2014, the, qualitywatch, research, programme, published, in, depth, analysis, which, tracked, 41, million, a, e, attendances, from, 2010, to, 2013, this, showed, that, the, number, of, patients, in, a, department, at, any, one, time, was, closely, linked, to, waiting, times, and, that, crowding, in, a, e, had, increased, as, a, result, of, a, growing, and, ageing, population, compounded, by, the, freezing, or, reduction, of, a, e, capacity, between, 2010, 11, and, 2012, 13, crowding, increased, by, 8, despite, a, rise, of, just, 3, in, a, e, visits, and, this,

inpatient, bed, numbers, a, e, services, in, the, uk, are, often, the, focus, of, a, great, deal, of, media, and, political, interest, and, data, on, a, e, performance, is, published, weekly, however, this, is, only, one, part, of, a, complex, urgent, and, emergency, care, system, reducing, a, e, waiting, times, therefore, requires, a, comprehensive, coordinated, strategy, across, a, range, of, related, services, many, a, e, departments, are, crowded, and, confusing, many, of, those, attending, are, understandably, anxious, and, some, are, mentally, ill, and, especially, at, night, are, under, the, influence, of, alcohol, or, other, substances, pearson, lloyd, s, redesign, a, better, a, e, is, claimed, to, have, reduced, aggression, against, hospital, staff, in, the, departments, by,

the, current, status, of, the, a, e, department, waiting, times, for, patients, to, be, seen, at, a, e, were, rising, in, the, years, leading, up, to, 2020, and, were, hugely, worsened, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, that, started, in, 2020, in, response, to, the, year, on, year, increasing, pressure, on, a, e, units, followed, by, the, unprecedented, effects, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, the, nhs, in, late, 2020, proposed, a, radical, change, to, handling, of, urgent, and, emergency, care, separating, emergency, and, urgent, emergencies, are, life, threatening, illnesses, or, accidents, which, require, immediate, intensive, treatment, services, that, should, be, accessed, in, an, emergency, include, ambulance, via, 999, and, emergency, departments, urgent, requirements, are, for, an, illness, or, injury, that, requires, urgent, attention, but, is, not, a, life, threatening, situation, urgent, care, services, include, a, phone, consultation, through, the, nhs111,

more, appropriate, procedure, information, is, for, england, details, may, vary, in, different, countries, cardiac, arrest, is, a, sudden, in, most, cases, unexpected, loss, of, heart, function, breathing, and, consciousness, this, emergency, usually, results, from, an, electrical, disturbance, in, the, heart, that, disrupts, its, pumping, action, stopping, blood, flow, to, the, rest, of, the, body, it, is, different, from, a, heart, attack, where, blood, flow, to, a, part, of, the, heart, is, blocked, cardiac, arrest, may, occur, in, the, ed, a, e, or, a, patient, may, be, transported, by, ambulance, to, the, emergency, department, already, in, this, state, treatment, is, basic, life, support, automated, external, defibrillator, aed, and, advanced, life, support, as, taught, in, advanced, life, support, and, advanced, cardiac, life, support, courses, cardiac, arrest, is, not, a, condition, that, can, be, self, diagnosed, it, requires, immediate, medical, attention, and, diagnosis, by, a, healthcare, professional, patients, arriving, to, the, emergency, department, with, a, myocardial, infarction, heart, attack, are, likely, to, be, triaged, to, the, resuscitation, area, they, will, receive, oxygen, and, monitoring, and, have, an, early, ecg, aspirin, will, be, given, if, not, contraindicated, or, not, already, administered, by, the, ambulance, team, morphine, or, diamorphine, will, be, given, for, pain, sub, lingual, under, the, tongue, or, buccal, between, cheek, and, upper, gum, glyceryl, trinitrate, nitroglycerin, gtn, or, ntg, will, be, given, unless, contraindicated, by, the, presence, of, other, drugs, an, ecg, that, reveals, st, segment, elevation, suggests, complete, blockage, of, one, of, the, main, coronary, arteries, these, patients, require, immediate, reperfusion, re, opening, of, the, occluded, vessel, this, can, be, achieved, in, two, ways, thrombolysis, clot, busting, medication, or, percutaneous, transluminal, coronary, angioplasty, ptca, both, of, these, are, effective, in, reducing, significantly, the, mortality, of, myocardial, infarction, many, centers, are, now, moving, to, the, use, of, ptca, as, it, is, somewhat, more, effective, than, thrombolysis, if, it, can, be, administered, early, this, may, involve, transfer, to, a, nearby, facility, with, facilities, for, angioplasty, major, trauma, the, term, for, patients, with, multiple, injuries, often, from, a, motor, vehicle, crash, or, a, major, fall, is, initially, handled, in, the, emergency, department, however, trauma, is, a, separate, surgical, specialty, from, emergency, medicine, which, is, itself, a, medical, specialty, and, has, certifications, in, the, united, states, from, the, american, board, of, emergency, medicine, trauma, is, treated, by, a, trauma, team, who, have, been, trained, using, the, principles, taught, in, the, internationally, recognized, advanced, trauma, life, support, atls, course, of, the, american, college, of, surgeons, some, other, international, training, bodies, have, started, to, run, similar, courses, based, on, the, same, principles, the, services, that, are, provided, in, an, emergency, department, can, range, from, x, rays, and, the, setting, of, broken, bones, to, those, of, a, full, scale, trauma, centre, a, patient, s, chance, of, survival, is, greatly, improved, if, the, patient, receives, definitive, treatment, i, e, surgery, or, reperfusion, within, one, hour, of, an, accident, such, as, a, car, accident, or, onset, of, acute, illness, such, as, a, heart, attack, this, critical, time, frame, is, commonly, known, as, the, golden, hour, some, emergency, departments, in, smaller, hospitals, are, located, near, a, helipad, which, is, used, by, helicopters, to, transport, a, patient, to, a, trauma, centre, this, inter, hospital, transfer, is, often, done, when, a, patient, requires, advanced, medical, care, unavailable, at, the, local, facility, in, such, cases, the, emergency, department, can, only, stabilize, the, patient, for, transport, some, patients, arrive, at, an, emergency, department, for, a, complaint, of, mental, illness, in, many, jurisdictions, including, many, u, s, states, patients, who, appear, to, be, mentally, ill, and, to, present, a, danger, to, themselves, or, others, may, be, brought, against, their, will, to, an, emergency, department, by, law, enforcement, officers, for, psychiatric, examination, the, emergency, department, conducts, medical, clearance, rather, than, treats, acute, behavioral, disorders, from, the, emergency, department, patients, with, significant, mental, illness, will, be, transferred, to, a, psychiatric, unit, in, many, cases, involuntarily, in, recent, years, empath, units, have, been, developed, to, relieve, pressure, on, hospital, emergency, departments, and, improve, the, treatment, of, psychiatric, emergencies, emergency, departments, are, often, the, first, point, of, contact, with, healthcare, for, people, who, self, harm, as, such, they, are, crucial, in, supporting, them, and, can, play, a, role, in, preventing, suicide, at, the, same, time, according, to, a, study, conducted, in, england, people, who, self, harm, often, experience, that, they, do, not, receive, meaningful, care, at, the, emergency, department, higher, ambient, temperature, may, also, increase, mental, illness, related, emergency, department, presentations, particularly, in, females, acute, exacerbations, of, chronic, respiratory, diseases, mainly, asthma, and, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, are, assessed, as, emergencies, and, treated, with, oxygen, therapy, bronchodilators, steroids, or, theophylline, have, an, urgent, chest, x, ray, and, arterial,

exacerbations, of, copd, an, ed, requires, different, equipment, and, different, approaches, than, most, other, hospital, divisions, patients, frequently, arrive, with, unstable, conditions, and, so, must, be, treated, quickly, they, may, be, unconscious, and, information, such, as, their, medical, history, allergies, and, blood, type, may, be, unavailable, ed, staff, are, trained, to, work, quickly, and, effectively, even, with, minimal, information, ed, staff, must, also, interact, efficiently, with, pre, hospital, care, providers, such, as, emts, paramedics, and, others, who, are, occasionally, based, in, an, ed, the, pre, hospital, providers, may, use, equipment, unfamiliar, to, the, average, physician, but, ed, physicians, must, be, expert, in, using, and, safely, removing, specialized, equipment, since, devices, such, as, military, anti, shock, trousers, mast, and, traction, splints, require, special, procedures, among, other, reasons, given, that, they, must, be, able, to, handle, specialized, equipment, physicians, can, now, specialize, in, emergency, medicine, and, eds, employ, many, such, specialists, ed, staff, have, much, in, common, with, ambulance, and, fire, crews, combat, medics, search, and, rescue, teams, and, disaster, response, teams, often, joint, training, and, practice, drills, are, organized, to, improve, the, coordination, of, this, complex, response, system, busy, eds, exchange, a, great, deal, of, equipment, with, ambulance, crews, and, both, must, provide, for, replacing, returning, or, reimbursing, for, costly, items, cardiac, arrest, and, major, trauma, are, relatively, common, in, eds, so, defibrillators, automatic, ventilation, and, cpr, machines, and, bleeding, control, dressings, are, used, heavily, survival, in, such, cases, is, greatly, enhanced, by, shortening, the, wait, for, key, interventions, and, in, recent, years, some, of, this, specialized, equipment, has, spread, to, pre, hospital, settings, the, best, known, example, is, defibrillators, which, spread, first, to, ambulances, then, in, an, automatic, version, to, police, cars, and, fire, apparatus, and, most, recently, to, public, spaces, such, as, airports, office, buildings, hotels, and, even, shopping, malls, because, time, is, such, an, essential, factor, in, emergency, treatment, eds, typically, have, their, own, diagnostic, equipment, to, avoid, waiting, for, equipment, installed, elsewhere, in, the, hospital, nearly, all, have, radiographic, examination, rooms, staffed, by, dedicated, radiographers, and, many, now, have, full, radiology, facilities, including, ct, scanners, and, ultrasonography, equipment, laboratory, services, may, be, handled, on, a, priority, basis, by, the, hospital, lab, or, the, ed, may, have, its, own, stat, lab, for, basic, labs, blood, counts, blood, typing, toxicology, screens, etc, that, must, be, returned, very, rapidly, metrics, applicable, to, the, ed, can, be, grouped, into, three, main, categories, volume, cycle, time, and, patient, satisfaction, volume, metrics, including, arrivals, per, hour, percentage, of, ed, beds, occupied, and, age, of, patients, are, understood, at, a, basic, level, at, all, hospitals, as, an, indication, for, staffing, requirements, cycle, time, metrics, are, the, mainstays, of, the, evaluation, and, tracking, of, process, efficiency, and, are, less, widespread, since, an, active, effort, is, needed, to, collect, and, analyze, this, data, patient, satisfaction, metrics, already, commonly, collected, by, nursing, groups, physician, groups, and, hospitals, are, useful, in, demonstrating, the, impact, of, changes, in, patient, perception, of, care, over, time, since, patient, satisfaction, metrics, are, derivative, and, subjective, they, are, less, useful, in, primary, process, improvement, health, information, exchanges, can, reduce, nonurgent, ed, visits, by, supplying, current, data, about, admissions, discharges, and, transfers,

consultations, provided, by, general, practitioners, or, nurse, practitioners, in, the, united, states, barriers, to, accessing, care, contribute, to, frequent, emergency, room, use, the, national, hospital, ambulatory, medical, care, survey, looked, at, the, ten, most, common, symptoms, for, which, giving, rise, to, emergency, room, visits, cough, sore, throat, back, pain, fever, headache, abdominal, pain, chest, pain, other, pain, shortness, of, breath, vomiting, and, made, suggestions, as, to, which, would, be, the, most, cost, effective, choice, among, virtual, care, retail, clinic, urgent, care, or, emergency, room, notably, certain, complaints, may, also, be, addressed, by, a, telephone, call, to, a, person, s, primary, care, provider, however, subsequent, studies, have, shown, that, identifying, non, emergency, visits, based, on, discharge, diagnoses, is, inaccurate, because, people, commonly, present, for, emergency, care, for, other, reasons, and, are, assigned, a, diagnosis, after, testing, and, evaluation, in, the, united, states, and, many, other, countries, hospitals, are, beginning, to, create, areas, in, their, emergency, rooms, for, people, with, minor, injuries, these, are, commonly, referred, as, fast, track, or, minor, care, units, these, units, are, for, people, with, non, life, threatening, injuries, the, use, of, these, units, within, a, department, have, been, shown, to, significantly, improve, the, flow, of, patients, through, a, department, and, to, reduce, waiting, times, urgent, care, clinics, are, another, alternative, where, patients, can, go, to, receive, immediate, care, for, non, life, threatening, conditions, to, reduce, the, strain, on, limited, ed, resources, american, medical, response, created, a, checklist, that, allows, emts, to, identify, intoxicated, individuals, who, can, be, safely, sent, to, detoxification, facilities, instead, emergency, department, overcrowding, is, when, function, of, a, department, is, hindered, by, an, inability, to, treat, all, patients, in, an, adequate, manner, this, is, a, common, occurrence, in, emergency, departments, worldwide, overcrowding, causes, inadequate, patient, care, which, leads, to, poorer, patient, outcomes, to, address, this, problem, escalation, policies, are, used, by, emergency, departments, when, responding, to, an, increase, in, demand, e, g, a, sudden, inflow, of, patients, or, a, reduction, in, capacity, e, g, a, lack, of, beds, to, admit, patients, the, policies, aim, to, maintain, the, ability, to, deliver, patient, care, without, compromising, safety, by, modifying, normal, processes, emergency, department, ed, waiting, times, have, a, serious, impact, on, patient, mortality, morbidity, with, readmission, in, less, than, 30, days, length, of, stay, and, patient, satisfaction, the, probability, of, death, increases, each, 3, minutes, for, 1, in, case, of, major, injuries, in, the, abdomen, part, journal, of, trauma, and, acute, care, surgery, equipment, in, emergency, departments, follows, the, prompt, treatment, principle, with, the, least, possible, patient, transfers, from, admittance, to, x, ray, diagnostics, a, review, of, the, literature, bears, out, the, logical, premise, that, since, the, outcome, of, treatment, for, all, diseases, and, injuries, is, time, sensitive, the, sooner, treatment, is, rendered, the, better, the, outcome, various, studies, reported, significant, associations, between, waiting, times, and, higher, mortality, and, morbidity, among, those, who, survived, it, is, clear, from, the, literature, that, untimely, hospital, deaths, and, morbidity, can, be, reduced, by, reductions, in, ed, waiting, times, a, significant, proportion, of, emergency, patients, are, discharged, after, treatment, but, many, require, admission, for, ongoing, observation, treatment, or, to, ensure, adequate, social, care, before, discharge, if, patients, requiring, admission, cannot, be, placed, in, inpatient, beds, swiftly, exit, block, or, access, block, occurs, this, often, leads, to, crowding, and, can, lead, to, delays, in, treatment, for, newly, presenting, cases, arrival, access, block, this, is, more, common, in, densely, populated, areas, and, affects, adult, departments, more, than, pediatric, ones, exit, block, can, lead, to, delays, for, the, patients, awaiting, inpatient, beds, boarding, and, also, for, new, patients, arriving, at, an, exit, blocked, department, proposed, solutions, include, changes, in, staffing, or, increasing, inpatient, capacity, frequent, emergency, service, users, are, individuals, who, present, themselves, at, a, hospital, much, more, often, than, non, frequent, presenters, many, frequent, users, are, homeless, individuals, seeking, shelter, and, food, at, the, hospital, federal, laws, and, regulations, in, the, united, states, like, emtala, and, hipaa, limit, the, options, of, hospital, personnel, when, an, individual, presents, to, the, er, with, a, fabricated, problem, these, individuals, do, not, account, for, a, significant, number, of, visits, but, typically, require, a, disproportionate, amount, of, hospital, resources, to, help, prevent, inappropriate, emergency, department, use, and, return, visits, some, hospitals, offer, care, coordination, and, support, services, such, as, at, home, and, in, shelter, transitional, primary, care, for, frequent, users, and, short, term, housing, for, homeless, patients, recovering, after, discharge, a, study, found, that, telemedicine, services, in, saudi, arabia, were, effective, in, reducing, emergency, department, overload, by, providing, medical, advice, to, patients, with, less, urgent, medical, issues, emergency, departments, in, the, military, benefit, from, the, added, support, of, enlisted, personnel, who, are, capable, of, performing, a, wide, variety, of, tasks, they, have, been, trained, for, through, specialized, military, schooling, for, example, in, united, states, military, hospitals, air, force, aerospace, medical, technicians, and, navy, hospital, corpsmen, perform, tasks, that, fall, under, the, scope, of, practice, of, both, doctors, i, e, sutures, staples, and, incision, and, drainages, and, nurses, i, e, medication, administration, foley, catheter, insertion, and, obtaining, intravenous, access, and, also, perform, splinting, of, injured, extremities, nasogastric, tube, insertion, intubation, wound, cauterizing, eye, irrigation, and, much, more, often, some, civilian, education, and, or, certification, will, be, required, such, as, an, emt, certification, in, case, of, the, need, to, provide, care, outside, the, base, where, the, member, is, stationed, the, presence, of, highly, trained, enlisted, personnel, in, an, emergency, departments, drastically, reduces, the, workload, on, nurses, and, doctors, according, to, a, survey, at, an, urban, inner, city, tertiary, care, center, in, vancouver, 57, of, health, care, workers, were, physically, assaulted, in, 1996, 73, were, afraid, of, patients, as, a, result, of, violence, 49, hid, their, identities, from, patients, and, 74, had, reduced, job, satisfaction, over, one, quarter, of, the, respondents, took, days, off, because, of, violence, of, respondents, no, longer, working, in, the, emergency, department, 67, reported, that, they, had, left, the, job, at, least, partly, owing, to, violence, twenty, four, hour, security, and, a, workshop, on, violence, prevention, strategies, were, felt, to, be, the, most, useful, potential, interventions, physical, exercise, sleep, and, the, company, of, family, and, friends, were, the, most, frequent, coping, strategies, cited, by, those, surveyed, medication, errors, are, issues, that, lead, to, incorrect, medication, distribution, or, potential, for, patient, harm, as, of, 2014, around, 3, of, all, hospital, related, adverse, effects, were, due, to, medication, errors, in, the, emergency, department, ed, between, 4, and, 14, of, medications, given, to, patients, in, the, ed, were, incorrect, and, children, were, particularly, at, risk, errors, can, arise, if, the, doctor, prescribes, the, wrong, medication, if, the, prescription, intended, by, the, doctor, is, not, the, one, actually, communicated, to, the, pharmacy, due, to, an, illegibly, written, prescription, or, misheard, verbal, order, if, the, pharmacy, dispenses, the, wrong, medication, or, if, the, medication, is, then, given, to, the, wrong, person, the, ed, is, a, riskier, environment, than, other, areas, of, the, hospital, due, to, medical, practitioners, not, knowing, the, patient, as, well, as, they, know, longer, term, hospital, patients, due, to, time, pressure, caused, by, overcrowding, and, due, to, the, emergency, driven, nature, of, the, medicine, that, is, practiced, there
