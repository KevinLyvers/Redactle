strigidae, tytonidae, ogygoptyngidae, fossil, palaeoglaucidae, fossil, protostrigidae, fossil, sophiornithidae, fossil, strigidae, sensu, sibley, ahlquist, owls, are, birds, from, the, order, strigiformes, s, t, r, d, f, r, m, i, z, which, includes, over, 200, species, of, mostly, solitary, and, nocturnal, birds, of, prey, typified, by, an, upright, stance, a, large, broad, head, binocular, vision, binaural, hearing, sharp, talons, and, feathers, adapted, for, silent, flight, exceptions, include, the, diurnal, northern, hawk, owl, and, the, gregarious, burrowing, owl, owls, are, divided, into, two, families, the, true, or, typical, owl, family, strigidae, and, the, barn, owl, family, tytonidae, owls, hunt, mostly, small, mammals, insects, and, other, birds, although, a, few, species, specialize, in, hunting, fish, they, are, found, in, all, regions, of, the, earth, except, the, polar, ice, caps, and, some, remote, islands, a, group, of, owls, is, called, a, parliament, owls, possess, large, forward, facing, eyes, and, ear, holes, a, hawk, like, beak, a, flat, face, and, usually, a, conspicuous, circle, of, feathers, a, facial, disc, around, each, eye, the, feathers, making, up, this, disc, can, be, adjusted, to, sharply, focus, sounds, from, varying, distances, onto, the, owls, asymmetrically, placed, ear, cavities, most, birds, of, prey, have, eyes, on, the, sides, of, their, heads, but, the, stereoscopic, nature, of, the, owl, s, forward, facing, eyes, permits, the, greater, sense, of, depth, perception, necessary, for, low, light, hunting, owls, have, binocular, vision, but, they, must, rotate, their, entire, heads, to, change, the, focus, of, their, view, because, like, most, birds, their, eyes, are, fixed, in, their, sockets, owls, are, farsighted, and, cannot, clearly, see, anything, nearer, than, a, few, centimetres, of, their, eyes, caught, prey, can, be, felt, by, owls, with, the, use, of, filoplumes, hairlike, feathers, on, the, beak, and, feet, that, act, as, feelers, their, far, vision, particularly, in, low, light, is, exceptionally, good, owls, can, rotate, their, heads, and, necks, as, much, as, 270, owls, have, 14, neck, vertebrae, humans, have, only, seven, and, their, vertebral, circulatory, systems, are, adapted, to, allow, them, to, rotate, their, heads, without, cutting, off, blood, to, the, brain, specifically, the, foramina, in, their, vertebrae, through, which, the, vertebral, arteries, pass, are, about, 10, times, the, diameter, of, the, artery, instead, of, about, the, same, size, as, the, artery, as, is, the, case, in, humans, the, vertebral, arteries, enter, the, cervical, vertebrae, higher, than, in, other, birds, giving, the, vessels, some, slack, and, the, carotid, arteries, unite, in, a, very, large, anastomosis, or, junction, the, largest, of, any, bird, s, preventing, blood, supply, from, being, cut, off, while, they, rotate, their, necks, other, anastomoses, between, the, carotid, and, vertebral, arteries, support, this, effect, the, smallest, owl, weighing, as, little, as, 31, g, 1, 3, 32, oz, and, measuring, some, 13, 5, cm, 5, 1, 4, in, is, the, elf, owl, micrathene, whitneyi, around, the, same, diminutive, length, although, slightly, heavier, are, the, lesser, known, long, whiskered, owlet, xenoglaux, loweryi, and, tamaulipas, pygmy, owl, glaucidium, sanchezi, the, largest, owls, are, two, similarly, sized, eagle, owls, the, eurasian, eagle, owl, bubo, bubo, and, blakiston, s, fish, owl, bubo, blakistoni, the, largest, females, of, these, species, are, 71, cm, 28, in, long, have, a, 190, cm, 75, in, wing, span, and, weigh, 4, 2, kg, 9, 1, 4, lb, different, species, of, owls, produce, different, sounds, this, distribution, of, calls, aids, owls, in, finding, mates, or, announcing, their, presence, to, potential, competitors, and, also, aids, ornithologists, and, birders, in, locating, these, birds, and, distinguishing, species, as, noted, above, their, facial, discs, help, owls, to, funnel, the, sound, of, prey, to, their, ears, in, many, species, these, discs, are, placed, asymmetrically, for, better, directional, location, owl, plumage, is, generally, cryptic, although, several, species, have, facial, and, head, markings, including, face, masks, ear, tufts, and, brightly, colored, irises, these, markings, are, generally, more, common, in, species, inhabiting, open, habitats, and, are, thought, to, be, used, in, signaling, with, other, owls, in, low, light, conditions, sexual, dimorphism, is, a, physical, difference, between, males, and, females, of, a, species, female, owls, are, typically, larger, than, the, males, the, degree, of, size, dimorphism, varies, across, multiple, populations, and, species, and, is, measured, through, various, traits, such, as, wing, span, and, body, mass, one, theory, suggests, that, selection, has, led, males, to, be, smaller, because, it, allows, them, to, be, efficient, foragers, the, ability, to, obtain, more, food, is, advantageous, during, breeding, season, in, some, species, female, owls, stay, at, their, nest, with, their, eggs, while, it, is, the, responsibility, of, the, male, to, bring, back, food, to, the, nest, if, food, is, scarce, the, male, first, feeds, himself, before, feeding, the, female, small, birds, which, are, agile, are, an, important, source, of, food, for, owls, male, burrowing, owls, have, been, observed, to, have, longer, wing, chords, than, females, despite, being, smaller, than, females, furthermore, owls, have, been, observed, to, be, roughly, the, same, size, as, their, prey, this, has, also, been, observed, in, other, predatory, birds, which, suggests, that, owls, with, smaller, bodies, and, long, wing, chords, have, been, selected, for, because, of, the, increased, agility, and, speed, that, allows, them, to, catch, their, prey, another, popular, theory, suggests, that, females, have, not, been, selected, to, be, smaller, like, male, owls, because, of, their, sexual, roles, in, many, species, female, owls, may, not, leave, the, nest, therefore, females, may, have, a, larger, mass, to, allow, them, to, go, for, a, longer, period, of, time, without, starving, for, example, one, hypothesized, sexual, role, is, that, larger, females, are, more, capable, of, dismembering, prey, and, feeding, it, to, their, young, hence, female, owls, are, larger, than, their, male, counterparts, a, different, theory, suggests, that, the, size, difference, between, male, and, females, is, due, to, sexual, selection, since, large, females, can, choose, their, mate, and, may, violently, reject, a, male, s, sexual, advances, smaller, male, owls, that, have, the, ability, to, escape, unreceptive, females, are, more, likely, to, have, been, selected, if, the, character, is, stable, there, can, be, different, optimums, for, both, sexes, selection, operates, on, both, sexes, at, the, same, time, therefore, it, is, necessary, to, explain, not, only, why, one, of, the, sexes, is, relatively, bigger, but, also, why, the, other, sex, is, smaller, if, owls, are, still, evolving, toward, smaller, bodies, and, longer, wing, chords, according, to, v, geodakyan, s, evolutionary, theory, of, sex, males, should, be, more, advanced, on, these, characters, males, are, viewed, as, an, evolutionary, vanguard, of, a, population, and, sexual, dimorphism, on, the, character, as, an, evolutionary, distance, between, the, sexes, phylogenetic, rule, of, sexual, dimorphism, states, that, if, there, exists, a, sexual, dimorphism, on, any, character, then, the, evolution, of, this, trait, goes, from, the, female, form, toward, the, male, one, all, owls, are, carnivorous, birds, of, prey, and, live, on, diets, of, insects, small, rodents, and, lagomorphs, some, owls, are, also, specifically, adapted, to, hunt, fish, they, are, very, adept, in, hunting, in, their, respective, environments, since, owls, can, be, found, in, nearly, all, parts, of, the, world, and, across, a, multitude, of, ecosystems, their, hunting, skills, and, characteristics, vary, slightly, from, species, to, species, though, most, characteristics, are, shared, among, all, species, most, owls, share, an, innate, ability, to, fly, almost, silently, and, also, more, slowly, in, comparison, to, other, birds, of, prey, most, owls, live, a, mainly, nocturnal, lifestyle, and, being, able, to, fly, without, making, any, noise, gives, them, a, strong, advantage, over, prey, alert, to, the, slightest, sound, in, the, night, a, silent, slow, flight, is, not, as, necessary, for, diurnal, and, crepuscular, owls, given, that, prey, can, usually, see, an, owl, approaching, owls, feathers, are, generally, larger, than, the, average, birds, feathers, have, fewer, radiates, longer, pennulum, and, achieve, smooth, edges, with, different, rachis, structures, serrated, edges, along, the, owl, s, remiges, bring, the, flapping, of, the, wing, down, to, a, nearly, silent, mechanism, the, serrations, are, more, likely, reducing, aerodynamic, disturbances, rather, than, simply, reducing, noise, the, surface, of, the, flight, feathers, is, covered, with, a, velvety, structure, that, absorbs, the, sound, of, the, wing, moving, these, unique, structures, reduce, noise, frequencies, above, 2, khz, making, the, sound, level, emitted, drop, below, the, typical, hearing, spectrum, of, the, owl, s, usual, prey, and, also, within, the, owl, s, own, best, hearing, range, this, optimizes, the, owl, s, ability, to, silently, fly, to, capture, prey, without, the, prey, hearing, the, owl, first, as, it, flies, and, to, hear, any, noise, the, prey, makes, it, also, allows, the, owl, to, monitor, the, sound, output, from, its, flight, pattern, the, disadvantage, of, such, feather, adaptations, for, barn, owls, is, that, their, feathers, are, not, waterproof, the, adaptations, mean, that, barn, owls, do, not, use, the, uropygial, gland, informally, the, preen, or, oil, gland, as, most, birds, do, to, spread, oils, across, their, plumage, through, preening, this, makes, them, highly, vulnerable, to, heavy, rain, when, they, are, unable, to, hunt, historically, they, would, switch, to, hunting, indoors, in, wet, weather, using, barns, and, other, agricultural, buildings, but, the, decline, in, the, numbers, of, these, structures, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, has, reduced, such, opportunities, the, lack, of, waterproofing, means, that, barn, owls, are, also, susceptible, to, drowning, in, drinking, troughs, and, other, structures, with, smooth, sides, the, barn, owl, trust, provides, advice, on, how, this, can, be, mitigated, by, the, installation, of, floats, eyesight, is, a, particular, characteristic, of, the, owl, that, aids, in, nocturnal, prey, capture, owls, are, part, of, a, small, group, of, birds, that, live, nocturnally, but, do, not, use, echolocation, to, guide, them, in, flight, in, low, light, situations, owls, are, known, for, their, disproportionally, large, eyes, in, comparison, to, their, skulls, an, apparent, consequence, of, the, evolution, of, an, absolutely, large, eye, in, a, relatively, small, skull, is, that, the, eye, of, the, owl, has, become, tubular, in, shape, this, shape, is, found, in, other, so, called, nocturnal, eyes, such, as, the, eyes, of, strepsirrhine, primates, and, bathypelagic, fishes, since, the, eyes, are, fixed, into, these, sclerotic, tubes, they, are, unable, to, move, the, eyes, in, any, direction, instead, of, moving, their, eyes, owls, swivel, their, heads, to, view, their, surroundings, owls, heads, are, capable, of, swiveling, through, an, angle, of, roughly, 270, easily, enabling, them, to, see, behind, them, without, relocating, the, torso, this, ability, keeps, bodily, movement, at, a, minimum, thus, reduces, the, amount, of, sound, the, owl, makes, as, it, waits, for, its, prey, owls, are, regarded, as, having, the, most, frontally, placed, eyes, among, all, avian, groups, which, gives, them, some, of, the, largest, binocular, fields, of, vision, owls, are, farsighted, and, cannot, focus, on, objects, within, a, few, centimetres, of, their, eyes, these, mechanisms, are, only, able, to, function, due, to, the, large, sized, retinal, image, thus, the, primary, nocturnal, function, in, the, vision, of, the, owl, is, due, to, its, large, posterior, nodal, distance, retinal, image, brightness, is, only, maximized, to, the, owl, within, secondary, neural, functions, these, attributes, of, the, owl, cause, its, nocturnal, eyesight, to, be, far, superior, to, that, of, its, average, prey, owls, exhibit, specialized, hearing, functions, and, ear, shapes, that, also, aid, in, hunting, they, are, noted, for, asymmetrical, ear, placements, on, the, skull, in, some, genera, owls, can, have, either, internal, or, external, ears, both, of, which, are, asymmetrical, asymmetry, has, not, been, reported, to, extend, to, the, middle, or, internal, ear, of, the, owl, asymmetrical, ear, placement, on, the, skull, allows, the, owl, to, pinpoint, the, location, of, its, prey, this, is, especially, true, for, strictly, nocturnal, species, such, as, the, barn, owls, tyto, or, tengmalm, s, owl, with, ears, set, at, different, places, on, its, skull, an, owl, is, able, to, determine, the, direction, from, which, the, sound, is, coming, by, the, minute, difference, in, time, that, it, takes, for, the, sound, waves, to, penetrate, the, left, and, right, ears, the, owl, turns, its, head, until, the, sound, reaches, both, ears, at, the, same, time, at, which, point, it, is, directly, facing, the, source, of, the, sound, this, time, difference, between, ears, is, about, 30, microseconds, behind, the, ear, openings, are, modified, dense, feathers, densely, packed, to, form, a, facial, ruff, which, creates, an, anterior, facing, concave, wall, that, cups, the, sound, into, the, ear, structure, this, facial, ruff, is, poorly, defined, in, some, species, and, prominent, nearly, encircling, the, face, in, other, species, the, facial, disk, also, acts, to, direct, sound, into, the, ears, and, a, downward, facing, sharply, triangular, beak, minimizes, sound, reflection, away, from, the, face, the, shape, of, the, facial, disk, is, adjustable, at, will, to, focus, sounds, more, effectively, the, prominences, above, a, great, horned, owl, s, head, are, commonly, mistaken, as, its, ears, this, is, not, the, case, they, are, merely, feather, tufts, the, ears, are, on, the, sides, of, the, head, in, the, usual, location, in, two, different, locations, as, described, above, while, the, auditory, and, visual, capabilities, of, the, owl, allow, it, to, locate, and, pursue, its, prey, the, talons, and, beak, of, the, owl, do, the, final, work, the, owl, kills, its, prey, using, these, talons, to, crush, the, skull, and, knead, the, body, the, crushing, power, of, an, owl, s, talons, varies, according, to, prey, size, and, type, and, by, the, size, of, the, owl, the, burrowing, owl, athene, cunicularia, a, small, partly, insectivorous, owl, has, a, release, force, of, only, 5, n, the, larger, barn, owl, tyto, alba, needs, a, force, of, 30, n, to, release, its, prey, and, one, of, the, largest, owls, the, great, horned, owl, bubo, virginianus, needs, a, force, over, 130, n, to, release, prey, in, its, talons, an, owl, s, talons, like, those, of, most, birds, of, prey, can, seem, massive, in, comparison, to, the, body, size, outside, of, flight, the, tasmanian, masked, owl, has, some, of, the, proportionally, longest, talons, of, any, bird, of, prey, they, appear, enormous, in, comparison, to, the, body, when, fully, extended, to, grasp, prey, an, owl, s, claws, are, sharp, and, curved, the, family, tytonidae, has, inner, and, central, toes, of, about, equal, length, while, the, family, strigidae, has, an, inner, toe, that, is, distinctly, shorter, than, the, central, one, these, different, morphologies, allow, efficiency, in, capturing, prey, specific, to, the, different, environments, they, inhabit, the, beak, of, the, owl, is, short, curved, and, downward, facing, and, typically, hooked, at, the, tip, for, gripping, and, tearing, its, prey, once, prey, is, captured, the, scissor, motion, of, the, top, and, lower, bill, is, used, to, tear, the, tissue, and, kill, the, sharp, lower, edge, of, the, upper, bill, works, in, coordination, with, the, sharp, upper, edge, of, the, lower, bill, to, deliver, this, motion, the, downward, facing, beak, allows, the, owl, s, field, of, vision, to, be, clear, as, well, as, directing, sound, into, the, ears, without, deflecting, sound, waves, away, from, the, face, the, coloration, of, the, owl, s, plumage, plays, a, key, role, in, its, ability, to, sit, still, and, blend, into, the, environment, making, it, nearly, invisible, to, prey, owls, tend, to, mimic, the, coloration, and, sometimes, the, texture, patterns, of, their, surroundings, the, barn, owl, being, an, exception, the, snowy, owl, bubo, scandiacus, appears, nearly, bleach, white, in, color, with, a, few, flecks, of, black, mimicking, their, snowy, surroundings, perfectly, while, the, speckled, brown, plumage, of, the, tawny, owl, strix, aluco, allows, it, to, lie, in, wait, among, the, deciduous, woodland, it, prefers, for, its, habitat, likewise, the, mottled, wood, owl, strix, ocellata, displays, shades, of, brown, tan, and, black, making, the, owl, nearly, invisible, in, the, surrounding, trees, especially, from, behind, usually, the, only, tell, tale, sign, of, a, perched, owl, is, its, vocalizations, or, its, vividly, colored, eyes, most, owls, are, nocturnal, actively, hunting, their, prey, in, darkness, several, types, of, owls, are, crepuscular, active, during, the, twilight, hours, of, dawn, and, dusk, one, example, is, the, pygmy, owl, glaucidium, a, few, owls, are, active, during, the, day, also, examples, are, the, burrowing, owl, speotyto, cunicularia, and, the, short, eared, owl, asio, flammeus, much, of, the, owls, hunting, strategy, depends, on, stealth, and, surprise, owls, have, at, least, two, adaptations, that, aid, them, in, achieving, stealth, first, the, dull, coloration, of, their, feathers, can, render, them, almost, invisible, under, certain, conditions, secondly, serrated, edges, on, the, leading, edge, of, owls, remiges, muffle, an, owl, s, wing, beats, allowing, an, owl, s, flight, to, be, practically, silent, some, fish, eating, owls, for, which, silence, has, no, evolutionary, advantage, lack, this, adaptation, an, owl, s, sharp, beak, and, powerful, talons, allow, it, to, kill, its, prey, before, swallowing, it, whole, if, it, is, not, too, big, scientists, studying, the, diets, of, owls, are, helped, by, their, habit, of, regurgitating, the, indigestible, parts, of, their, prey, such, as, bones, scales, and, fur, in, the, form, of, pellets, these, owl, pellets, are, plentiful, and, easy, to, interpret, and, are, often, sold, by, companies, to, schools, for, dissection, by, students, as, a, lesson, in, biology, and, ecology, owl, eggs, typically, have, a, white, color, and, an, almost, spherical, shape, and, range, in, number, from, a, few, to, a, dozen, depending, on, species, and, the, particular, season, for, most, three, or, four, is, the, more, common, number, in, at, least, one, species, female, owls, do, not, mate, with, the, same, male, for, a, lifetime, female, burrowing, owls, commonly, travel, and, find, other, mates, while, the, male, stays, in, his, territory, and, mates, with, other, females, recent, phylogenetic, studies, place, owls, within, the, clade, telluraves, most, closely, related, to, the, accipitrimorphae, and, the, coraciimorphae, although, the, exact, placement, within, telluraves, is, disputed, see, below, cladogram, cathartiformes, new, world, vultures, accipitriformes, hawks, and, relatives, strigiformes, owls, coliiformes, mouse, birds, leptosomiformes, cuckoo, roller, trogoniformes, trogons, and, quetzals, bucerotiformes, hornbills, and, relatives, coraciiformes, kingfishers, and, relatives, piciformes, woodpeckers, and, relatives, cariamiformes, seriemas, falconiformes, falcons, psittaciformes, parrots, passeriformes, passerines, cladogram, of, telluraves, relationships, based, on, braun, kimball, 2021, some, 220, to, 225, extant, species, of, owls, are, known, subdivided, into, two, families, 1, true, owls, or, typical, owls, family, strigidae, and, 2, barn, owls, family, tytonidae, some, entirely, extinct, families, have, also, been, erected, based, on, fossil, remains, these, differ, much, from, modern, owls, in, being, less, specialized, or, specialized, in, a, very, different, way, such, as, the, terrestrial, sophiornithidae, the, paleocene, genera, berruornis, and, ogygoptynx, show, that, owls, were, already, present, as, a, distinct, lineage, some, 60, 57, million, years, ago, mya, hence, possibly, also, some, 5, million, years, earlier, at, the, extinction, of, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, this, makes, them, one, of, the, oldest, known, groups, of, non, galloanserae, landbirds, the, supposed, cretaceous, owls, bradycneme, and, heptasteornis, are, apparently, non, avialan, maniraptors, during, the, paleogene, the, strigiformes, radiated, into, ecological, niches, now, mostly, filled, by, other, groups, of, birds, the, owls, as, known, today, though, evolved, their, characteristic, morphology, and, adaptations, during, that, time, too, by, the, early, neogene, the, other, lineages, had, been, displaced, by, other, bird, orders, leaving, only, barn, owls, and, typical, owls, the, latter, at, that, time, was, usually, a, fairly, generic, type, of, probably, earless, owl, similar, to, today, s, north, american, spotted, owl, or, the, european, tawny, owl, the, diversity, in, size, and, ecology, found, in, typical, owls, today, developed, only, subsequently, around, the, paleogene, neogene, boundary, some, 25, mya, barn, owls, were, the, dominant, group, of, owls, in, southern, europe, and, adjacent, asia, at, least, the, distribution, of, fossil, and, present, day, owl, lineages, indicates, that, their, decline, is, contemporary, with, the, evolution, of, the, different, major, lineages, of, true, owls, which, for, the, most, part, seems, to, have, taken, place, in, eurasia, in, the, americas, rather, an, expansion, of, immigrant, lineages, of, ancestral, typical, owls, occurred, the, supposed, fossil, herons, ardea, perplexa, middle, miocene, of, sansan, france, and, ardea, lignitum, late, pliocene, of, germany, were, more, probably, owls, the, latter, was, apparently, close, to, the, modern, genus, bubo, judging, from, this, the, late, miocene, remains, from, france, described, as, ardea, aureliensis, should, also, be, restudied, the, messelasturidae, some, of, which, were, initially, believed, to, be, basal, strigiformes, are, now, generally, accepted, to, be, diurnal, birds, of, prey, showing, some, convergent, evolution, toward, owls, the, taxa, often, united, under, strigogyps, were, formerly, placed, in, part, with, the, owls, specifically, the, sophiornithidae, they, appear, to, be, ameghinornithidae, instead, for, fossil, species, and, paleosubspecies, of, extant, taxa, see, the, genus, and, species, articles, for, a, full, list, of, extant, and, recently,

among, the, kikuyu, of, kenya, it, was, believed, that, owls, were, harbingers, of, death, if, one, saw, an, owl, or, heard, its, hoot, someone, was, going, to, die, in, general, owls, are, viewed, as, harbingers, of, bad, luck, ill, health, or, death, the, belief, is, widespread, even, today, in, china, owls, were, traditionally, considered, to, be, omens, of, evil, or, misfortune, in, japan, owls, are, regarded, as, lucky, although, in, ancient, times, they, were, associated, with, death, in, india, it, is, associated, with, bad, luck, in, mongolia, the, owl, is, regarded, as, a, benign, omen, in, one, story, genghis, khan, was, hiding, from, enemies, in, a, small, coppice, when, an, owl, roosted, in, the, tree, above, him, which, caused, his, pursuers, to, think, no, man, could, be, hidden, there, hootum, pyanchar, naksha, by, kaliprasanna, singha, 1841, 1870, first, published, in, 1861, is, a, book, of, social, commentaries, influential, in, bengali, literature, the, name, literally, means, sketches, by, a, watching, owl, in, sumerian, akkadian, and, babylonian, culture, the, owl, was, associated, with, lilith, this, association, also, occurs, in, the, bible, in, some, translations, in, isaiah, 34, 14, the, modern, west, generally, associates, owls, with, wisdom, and, vigilance, this, link, goes, back, at, least, as, far, as, ancient, greece, where, athens, noted, for, art, and, scholarship, and, athena, athens, patron, goddess, and, the, goddess, of, wisdom, had, the, owl, as, a, symbol, marija, gimbutas, traces, veneration, of, the, owl, as, a, goddess,
