bos, bubalis, linnaeus, 1758, the, water, buffalo, bubalus, bubalis, also, called, domestic, water, buffalo, and, asian, water, buffalo, is, a, large, bovid, originating, in, the, indian, subcontinent, and, southeast, asia, today, it, is, also, kept, in, italy, the, balkans, australia, north, america, south, america, and, some, african, countries, two, extant, types, of, water, buffalo, are, recognized, based, on, morphological, and, behavioural, criteria, the, river, buffalo, of, the, indian, subcontinent, and, further, west, to, the, balkans, egypt, and, italy, and, the, swamp, buffalo, found, from, assam, in, the, west, through, southeast, asia, to, the, yangtze, valley, of, china, in, the, east, the, wild, water, buffalo, bubalus, arnee, most, probably, represents, the, ancestor, of, the, domestic, water, buffalo, results, of, a, phylogenetic, study, indicate, that, the, river, type, water, buffalo, probably, originated, in, western, india, and, was, domesticated, about, 6, 300, years, ago, whereas, the, swamp, type, originated, independently, from, mainland, southeast, asia, and, was, domesticated, about, 3, 000, to, 7, 000, years, ago, the, river, buffalo, dispersed, west, as, far, as, egypt, the, balkans, and, italy, while, swamp, buffalo, dispersed, to, the, rest, of, southeast, asia, and, up, to, the, yangtze, valley, water, buffaloes, were, traded, from, the, indus, valley, civilisation, to, mesopotamia, in, modern, iraq, in, 2500, bc, by, the, meluhhas, the, seal, of, a, scribe, employed, by, an, akkadian, king, shows, the, sacrifice, of, water, buffaloes, water, buffaloes, are, especially, suitable, for, tilling, rice, fields, and, their, milk, is, richer, in, fat, and, protein, than, that, of, dairy, cattle, a, large, feral, population, became, established, in, northern, australia, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, there, are, smaller, feral, herds, in, papua, new, guinea, tunisia, and, northeastern, argentina, feral, herds, are, also, present, in, new, britain, new, ireland, irian, jaya, colombia, guyana, suriname, brazil, and, uruguay, carl, linnaeus, first, described, the, genus, bos, and, the, water, buffalo, under, the, binomial, bos, bubalis, in, 1758, the, species, was, known, to, occur, in, asia, and, was, held, as, a, domestic, form, in, italy, ellerman, and, morrison, scott, treated, the, wild, and, domestic, forms, of, the, water, buffalo, as, conspecifics, whereas, others, treated, them, as, different, species, the, nomenclatorial, treatment, of, the, wild, and, domestic, forms, has, been, inconsistent, and, varies, between, authors, and, even, within, the, works, of, single, authors, in, march, 2003, the, international, commission, on, zoological, nomenclature, achieved, consistency, in, the, naming, of, the, wild, and, domestic, water, buffaloes, by, ruling, that, the, scientific, name, bubalus, arnee, is, valid, for, the, wild, form, b, bubalis, continues, to, be, valid, for, the, domestic, form, and, applies, also, to, feral, populations, in, the, early, 1970s, different, names, were, proposed, for, the, river, and, swamp, types, of, water, buffalos, the, river, type, was, referred, to, as, bubalus, bubalis, bubalis, linnaeus, 1758, while, the, swamp, type, was, referred, to, as, bubalus, bubalis, carabanensis, castillo, 1971, however, bubalus, carabanensis, is, considered, a, junior, synonym, of, bubalus, kerabau, fitzinger, 1860, the, skin, of, the, river, buffalo, is, black, but, some, specimens, may, have, dark, slate, coloured, skin, swamp, buffaloes, have, a, grey, skin, at, birth, which, becomes, slate, blue, later, albinoids, are, present, in, some, populations, river, buffaloes, have, longer, faces, smaller, girths, and, bigger, limbs, than, swamp, buffaloes, their, dorsal, ridges, extend, further, back, and, taper, off, more, gradually, their, horns, grow, downward, and, backward, then, curve, upward, in, a, spiral, swamp, buffaloes, are, heavy, bodied, and, stockily, built, with, a, short, body, and, large, belly, the, forehead, is, flat, the, eyes, are, prominent, the, face, is, short, and, the, muzzle, is, wide, the, neck, is, comparatively, long, and, the, withers, and, croup, are, prominent, a, dorsal, ridge, extends, backward, and, ends, abruptly, just, before, the, end, of, the, chest, their, horns, grow, outward, and, curve, in, a, semicircle, but, always, remain, more, or, less, on, the, plane, of, the, forehead, the, tail, is, short, reaching, only, to, the, hocks, size, of, the, body, and, shape, of, horns, may, vary, greatly, among, breeds, height, at, the, withers, is, 129, 133, cm, 51, 52, in, for, bulls, and, 120, 127, cm, 47, 50, in, for, cows, but, large, individuals, may, attain, 160, cm, 63, in, head, lump, length, at, maturity, typically, ranges, from, 240, 300, cm, 94, 118, in, with, a, 60, 100, cm, 24, 39, in, long, tail, they, range, in, weight, from, 300, 550, kg, 660, 1, 210, lb, but, weights, of, over, 1, 000, kg, 2, 200, lb, have, also, been, observed, tedong, bonga, is, a, piebald, water, buffalo, featuring, a, unique, black, and, white, colouration, that, is, favoured, by, the, toraja, of, sulawesi, the, swamp, buffalo, has, 48, chromosomes, while, the, river, buffalo, has, 50, chromosomes, the, two, types, do, not, readily, interbreed, but, fertile, offspring, can, occur, water, buffalo, cattle, hybrids, have, not, been, observed, to, occur, but, the, embryos, of, such, hybrids, reach, maturity, in, laboratory, experiments, albeit, at, lower, rates, than, non, hybrids, the, rumen, of, the, water, buffalo, differs, from, the, rumen, of, other, ruminants, it, contains, a, larger, population, of, bacteria, particularly, the, cellulolytic, bacteria, lower, protozoa, and, higher, fungi, zoospores, in, addition, higher, levels, of, the, rumen, ammonia, nitrogen, nh, 4, n, and, ph, have, been, found, compared, to, those, in, cattle, river, buffaloes, prefer, deep, water, swamp, buffaloes, prefer, to, wallow, in, mudholes, which, they, make, with, their, horns, during, wallowing, they, acquire, a, thick, coating, of, mud, both, are, well, adapted, to, a, hot, and, humid, climate, with, temperatures, ranging, from, 0, c, 32, f, in, the, winter, to, 30, c, 86, f, and, greater, in, the, summer, water, availability, is, important, in, hot, climates, since, they, need, wallows, rivers, or, splashing, water, to, assist, in, thermoregulation, some, water, buffalo, breeds, are, adapted, to, saline, seaside, shores, and, saline, sandy, terrain, water, buffaloes, thrive, on, many, aquatic, plants, during, floods, they, graze, submerged, raising, their, heads, above, the, water, and, carrying, quantities, of, edible, plants, water, buffaloes, eat, reeds, arundo, donax, a, kind, of, cyperaceae, eichhornia, crassipes, and, juncaceae, some, of, these, plants, are, of, great, value, to, local, peoples, others, such, as, e, crassipes, and, a, donax, are, a, major, problem, in, some, tropical, valleys, and, by, eating, them, the, water, buffaloes, may, help, control, these, invasive, plants, green, fodders, are, widely, used, for, intensive, milk, production, and, for, fattening, many, fodder, crops, are, conserved, as, hay, chaffed, or, pulped, fodders, include, alfalfa, the, leaves, stems, or, trimmings, of, banana, cassava, mangelwurzel, esparto, leucaena, leucocephala, and, kenaf, maize, oats, pandanus, peanut, sorghum, soybean, sugarcane, bagasse, and, turnips, citrus, pulp, and, pineapple, wastes, have, been, fed, safely, to, buffalo, in, egypt, whole, sun, dried, dates, are, fed, to, milk, buffalo, up, to, 25, of, the, standard, feed, mixture, swamp, buffaloes, generally, become, reproductive, at, an, older, age, than, river, breeds, young, males, in, egypt, india, and, pakistan, are, first, mated, around, 3, 0, 3, 5, years, of, age, but, in, italy, they, may, be, used, as, early, as, 2, years, of, age, successful, mating, behaviour, may, continue, until, the, animal, is, 12, years, or, even, older, a, good, river, buffalo, male, can, impregnate, 100, females, in, a, year, a, strong, seasonal, influence, on, mating, occurs, heat, stress, reduces, libido, although, water, buffaloes, are, polyoestrous, their, reproductive, efficiency, shows, wide, variation, throughout, the, year, the, cows, exhibit, a, distinct, seasonal, change, in, displaying, oestrus, conception, rate, and, calving, rate, the, age, at, the, first, oestrus, of, heifers, varies, between, breeds, from, 13, to, 33, months, but, mating, at, the, first, oestrus, is, often, infertile, and, usually, deferred, until, they, are, 3, years, old, gestation, lasts, from, 281, to, 334, days, but, most, reports, give, a, range, between, 300, and, 320, days, swamp, buffaloes, carry, their, calves, for, one, or, two, weeks, longer, than, river, buffaloes, finding, water, buffaloes, that, continue, to, work, well, at, the, age, of, 30, is, not, uncommon, and, instances, of, a, working, life, of, 40, years, have, been, recorded, the, most, probable, ancestor, of, domesticated, water, buffalo, is, the, wild, water, buffalo, bubalus, arnee, which, is, native, to, the, indian, subcontinent, and, tropical, southeast, asia, two, types, of, domesticated, water, buffalo, are, recognized, based, on, morphological, and, behavioural, criteria, the, river, buffalo, of, the, western, indian, subcontinent, and, west, to, the, levant, the, balkans, and, the, mediterranean, and, the, swamp, buffalo, found, from, assam, and, east, india, in, the, west, east, to, the, yangtze, valley, of, china, and, south, through, indochina, and, southeast, asia, river, and, swamp, type, water, buffalo, are, believed, to, have, been, domesticated, independently, results, of, a, phylogenetic, study, indicate, that, the, river, type, water, buffalo, probably, originated, in, western, india, and, was, probable, domesticated, about, 6, 300, years, ago, the, swamp, type, originated, independently, from, mainland, southeast, asia, being, domesticated, between, 3, 7, 000, years, ago, the, river, buffalo, dispersed, west, as, far, as, egypt, southern, europe, the, levant, and, the, mediterranean, regions, swamp, buffalo, dispersed, in, the, opposite, direction, to, the, rest, of, southeast, asia, and, as, far, as, the, yangtze, valley, in, china, swamp, type, water, buffalo, entered, island, southeast, asia, from, at, least, 2, 500, years, ago, through, the, northern, philippines, where, butchered, remains, of, domesticated, water, buffalo, have, been, recovered, from, the, neolithic, nagsabaran, site, part, of, the, lal, lo, and, gattaran, shell, middens, c, 2200, bce, to, 400, ce, these, became, the, ancestors, of, the, distinctly, swamp, type, carabao, buffalo, breed, of, the, philippines, which, in, turn, spread, to, guam, indonesia, and, malaysia, among, other, smaller, islands, the, present, day, river, buffalo, is, the, result, of, complex, domestication, processes, involving, more, than, one, maternal, lineage, and, a, significant, maternal, gene, flow, from, wild, populations, after, the, initial, domestication, events, twenty, two, breeds, of, the, river, buffalo, are, known, including, the, murrah, niliravi, surti, carabao, anatolian, mediterranean, and, egyptian, buffaloes, china, has, a, huge, variety, of, water, buffalo, genetic, resources, with, 16, local, swamp, buffalo, breeds, in, various, regions, results, of, mitochondrial, dna, analyses, indicate, that, the, two, types, were, domesticated, independently, sequencing, of, cytochrome, b, cytb, genes, of, bubalus, species, implies, that, the, water, buffalo, originated, from, at, least, two, populations, and, that, the, river, type, and, the, swamp, type, have, differentiated, at, the, full, species, level, the, genetic, distance, between, the, two, types, is, so, large, that, a, divergence, time, of, about, 1, 7, million, years, has, been, suggested, the, swamp, type, was, noticed, to, have, the, closest, relationship, with, the, tamaraw, of, the, northern, philippines, a, 2008, dna, analysis, of, neolithic, water, buffalo, remains, in, northern, china, previously, used, as, evidence, of, a, chinese, domestication, origin, found, that, the, remains, were, of, the, extinct, bubalus, mephistopheles, and, are, not, genetically, related, to, modern, domesticated, water, buffaloes, another, study, in, 2004, also, concluded, that, the, remains, were, from, wild, specimens, both, indicate, that, water, buffaloes, were, first, domesticated, outside, of, china, analyses, of, mitochondrial, dna, and, single, nucleotide, polymorphism, indicate, that, swamp, and, river, buffaloes, were, crossbred, in, china, a, 2020, analysis, of, the, genomes, of, 91, swamp, and, 30, river, buffaloes, showed, that, they, separated, already, before, domestication, about, 0, 23, million, years, ago, a, 2021, analysis, of, water, buffalo, and, lowland, anoa, genomes, unexpectedly, found, the, anoa, branching, somewhere, between, swamp, and, river, buffalos, a, 2023, filipino, study, using, the, cytb, gene, instead, found, the, tamaraw, branching, between, the, two, by, 2011, the, global, water, buffalo, population, was, about, 172, million, the, estimated, global, population, of, water, buffalo, is, 208, 098, 759, head, distributed, in, 77, countries, in, five, continents, more, than, 95, 8, of, the, world, population, of, water, buffaloes, are, kept, in, asia, including, both, the, river, type, and, the, swamp, type, the, water, buffalo, population, in, india, numbered, over, 97, 9, million, head, in, 2003, representing, 56, 5, of, the, world, population, they, are, primarily, of, the, river, type, with, 10, well, defined, breeds, the, bhadawari, banni, jafarabadi, marathwadi, mehsana, murrah, nagpuri, nili, ravi, pandharpuri, surti, and, toda, buffaloes, swamp, buffaloes, occur, only, in, small, areas, in, northeastern, india, and, are, not, distinguished, into, breeds, in, 2003, the, second, largest, population, lived, in, china, with, 22, 76, million, head, all, of, the, swamp, type, with, many, breeds, kept, only, in, the, lowlands, and, other, breeds, kept, only, in, the, mountains, as, of, 2003, 3, 2, million, swamp, type, carabao, buffaloes, were, in, the, philippines, nearly, 3, million, swamp, buffaloes, were, in, vietnam, and, roughly, 773, 000, buffaloes, were, in, bangladesh, about, 750, 000, head, were, estimated, in, sri, lanka, in, 1997, in, japan, the, water, buffalo, was, used, as, a, domestic, animal, throughout, the, ryukyu, islands, or, okinawa, prefecture, however, it, is, almost, extinct, now, and, mainly, used, as, a, tourist, attraction, per, a, 2015, report, about, 836, 500, water, buffaloes, were, in, nepal, the, water, buffalo, is, the, main, dairy, animal, in, pakistan, with, 23, 47, million, head, in, 2010, of, these, 76, are, kept, in, the, punjab, the, rest, are, mostly, kept, in, the, province, of, sindh, the, water, buffalo, breeds, used, are, the, nili, ravi, kundi, and, azi, kheli, karachi, alone, has, upwards, of, 400, 000, head, of, water, buffalo, in, 2021, which, provide, dairy, as, well, as, meat, to, the, local, population, in, thailand, the, number, of, water, buffaloes, dropped, from, more, than, 3, million, head, in, 1996, to, less, than, 1, 24, million, head, in, 2011, slightly, over, 75, of, them, are, kept, in, the, country, s, northeastern, region, by, the, beginning, of, 2012, less, than, one, million, were, in, the, country, partly, as, a, result, of, illegal, shipments, to, neighbouring, countries, where, sales, prices, are, higher, than, in, thailand, water, buffaloes, are, also, present, in, the, southern, region, of, iraq, in, the, mesopotamian, marshes, the, draining, of, the, mesopotamian, marshes, by, saddam, hussein, was, an, attempt, to, punish, the, south, for, the, 1991, iraqi, uprisings, after, 2003, and, the, firdos, square, statue, destruction, these, lands, were, reflooded, and, a, 2007, report, on, maysan, and, dhi, qar, shows, a, steady, increase, in, the, number, of, water, buffaloes, the, report, puts, the, number, at, 40, 008, head, in, those, two, provinces, water, buffaloes, were, probably, introduced, to, europe, from, india, or, other, eastern, sources, in, italy, the, longobard, king, agilulf, is, said, to, have, received, water, buffaloes, around, 600, ad, these, were, probably, a, present, from, the, khan, of, the, avars, a, turkic, nomadic, tribe, that, dwelt, near, the, danube, river, at, the, time, sir, h, johnston, knew, of, a, herd, of, water, buffaloes, presented, by, a, king, of, naples, to, the, bey, of, tunis, in, the, mid, 19th, century, that, had, resumed, the, feral, state, in, northern, tunis, european, water, buffaloes, are, all, of, the, river, type, and, considered, to, be, of, the, same, breed, named, the, mediterranean, buffalo, in, italy, the, mediterranean, type, was, particularly, selected, and, is, called, the, mediterranea, italiana, buffalo, to, distinguish, it, from, other, european, breeds, which, differ, genetically, mediterranean, buffalo, are, also, kept, in, romania, bulgaria, greece, serbia, albania, kosovo, and, north, macedonia, with, a, few, hundred, in, the, united, kingdom, ireland, germany, the, netherlands, switzerland, and, hungary, little, exchange, of, breeding, water, buffaloes, has, occurred, among, countries, so, each, population, has, its, own, phenotypic, features, and, performances, in, bulgaria, they, were, crossbred, with, the, indian, murrah, breed, and, in, romania, some, were, crossbred, with, bulgarian, murrah, as, of, 2016, about, 13, 000, buffaloes, were, in, romania, down, from, 289, 000, in, 1989, populations, in, turkey, are, of, the, anatolian, buffalo, breed, between, 1824, and, 1849, swamp, buffaloes, were, introduced, into, the, northern, territory, from, timor, and, kisar, and, probably, other, islands, in, the, indonesian, archipelago, to, provide, meat, and, hide, when, the, third, attempt, at, settlement, by, the, british, on, the, cobourg, peninsula, was, abandoned, in, 1849, the, buffaloes, were, released, in, the, 1880s, a, few, river, buffaloes, were, imported, from, india, to, darwin, for, milk, water, buffalo, have, been, the, main, grazing, animals, on, the, subcoastal, plains, and, river, basins, between, darwin, and, arnhem, land, the, top, end, since, the, 1880s, they, became, feral, and, caused, significant, environmental, damage, their, only, natural, predators, in, australia, are, crocodiles, and, dingoes, which, can, only, prey, on, the, younger, animals, as, a, result, they, were, hunted, in, the, top, end, from, 1885, until, 1980, in, the, early, 1960s, an, estimated, population, of, 150, 000, to, 200, 000, water, buffaloes, was, living, in, the, plains, and, nearby, areas, the, commencement, of, the, brucellosis, and, tuberculosis, campaign, btec, resulted, in, a, huge, culling, program, to, reduce, water, buffalo, herds, to, a, fraction, of, the, numbers, that, were, reached, in, the, 1980s, the, btec, was, finished, when, the, northern, territory, was, declared, free, of, the, disease, in, 1997, numbers, dropped, dramatically, as, a, result, of, the, campaign, but, had, recovered, to, an, estimated, 150, 000, animals, across, northern, australia, in, 2008, and, up, to, an, estimated, 200, 000, by, 2022, both, swamp, and, river, buffaloes, exist, in, feral, populations, but, swamp, buffaloes, are, more, prevalent, than, river, buffaloes, nganabbarru, is, the, bininj, kunwok, word, for, buffalo, which, are, represented, in, rock, art, paintings, at, djabidjbakalloi, the, buffalo, left, behind, after, the, failed, british, attempt, at, settlement, became, a, threat, to, the, local, aboriginal, peoples, as, they, had, no, guns, at, that, time, as, the, herds, expanded, across, into, arnhem, land, some, local, people, seized, the, chance, to, hunt, the, animals, for, their, hides, in, the, 1880s, as, they, did, not, belong, to, anyone, unlike, sheep, and, cattle, the, industry, continues, to, provide, employment, opportunities, and, income, for, traditional, owners, during, the, 1950s, water, buffaloes, were, hunted, for, their, skins, and, meat, which, was, exported, and, used, in, the, local, trade, in, the, late, 1970s, live, exports, were, made, to, cuba, and, continued, later, into, other, countries, swamp, buffaloes, are, now, crossed, with, river, buffaloes, in, artificial, insemination, programs, and, are, kept, in, many, areas, of, australia, some, of, these, crossbreeds, are, used, for, milk, production, melville, island, is, a, popular, hunting, location, where, a, steady, population, up, to, 4, 000, individuals, exists, safari, outfits, are, run, from, darwin, to, melville, island, and, other, locations, in, the, top, end, often, with, the, use, of, bush, pilots, buffalo, horns, which, can, measure, up, to, a, record, of, 3, 1, m, 10, ft, tip, to, tip, are, prized, hunting, trophies, water, buffaloes, were, exported, live, to, indonesia, until, 2011, at, a, rate, of, about, 3, 000, per, year, after, the, live, export, ban, that, year, the, exports, dropped, to, zero, and, had, not, resumed, as, of, june, 2013, tom, dawkins, ceo, of, nt, buffalo, industry, council, said, in, may, 2022, that, culling, should, be, a, last, resort, given, the, flourishing, and, growing, live, export, trade, and, economic, benefits, for, aboriginal, people, by, the, end, of, 2021, cattle, exports, to, indonesia, had, dropped, to, the, lowest, level, since, 2012, while, demand, for, buffalo, was, growing, both, in, australia, and, in, southeast, asia, water, buffaloes, were, introduced, into, the, amazon, river, basin, in, 1895, they, are, now, extensively, used, there, for, meat, and, dairy, production, in, 2005, the, water, buffalo, herd, in, the, brazilian, amazon, stood, at, roughly, 1, 6, million, head, of, which, 460, 000, were, located, in, the, lower, amazon, floodplains, the, breeds, used, include, the, mediterranean, from, italy, the, murrah, and, jafarabadi, from, india, and, the, carabao, from, the, philippines, the, official, brazilian, herd, number, in, 2019, is, 1, 39, million, head, during, the, 1970s, small, herds, were, imported, to, costa, rica, ecuador, cayenne, panama, suriname, guyana, and, venezuela, in, argentina, many, game, ranches, raise, water, buffaloes, for, commercial, hunting, other, important, herds, in, south, america, are, colombia, 300, 000, argentina, 100, 000, and, venezuela, with, unconfirmed, reports, ranging, from, 200, to, 500, thousand, head, in, 1974, four, water, buffaloes, were, imported, to, the, united, states, from, guam, to, be, studied, at, the, university, of, florida, in, february, 1978, the, first, herd, arrived, for, commercial, farming, until, 2002, only, one, commercial, breeder, was, in, the, united, states, water, buffalo, meat, is, imported, from, australia, until, 2011, water, buffaloes, were, raised, in, gainesville, florida, from, young, obtained, from, zoo, overflow, they, were, used, primarily, for, meat, production, and, frequently, sold, as, hamburger, other, u, s, ranchers, use, them, for, production, of, high, quality, mozzarella, cheese, water, buffaloes, are, also, kept, in, the, caribbean, specifically, in, trinidad, and, tobago, and, cuba, the, husbandry, system, of, water, buffaloes, depends, on, the, purpose, for, which, they, are, bred, and, maintained, most, of, them, are, kept, by, people, who, work, on, small, farms, in, family, units, their, water, buffaloes, live, in, close, association, with, them, and, are, often, their, greatest, capital, asset, the, women, and, girls, in, india, generally, look, after, the, milking, buffaloes, while, the, men, and, boys, are, concerned, with, the, working, animals, throughout, asia, they, are, commonly, tended, by, children, who, are, often, seen, leading, or, riding, their, charges, to, wallows, water, buffaloes, are, the, ideal, animals, for, work, in, the, deep, mud, of, paddy, fields, because, of, their, large, hooves, and, flexible, foot, joints, they, are, often, referred, to, as, the, living, tractor, of, the, east, they, are, the, most, efficient, and, economical, means, of, cultivation, of, small, fields, in, most, rice, producing, countries, they, are, used, for, threshing, and, for, transporting, the, sheaves, during, the, rice, harvest, they, provide, power, for, oilseed, mills, sugarcane, presses, and, devices, for, raising, water, they, are, widely, used, as, pack, animals, and, in, india, and, pakistan, for, heavy, haulage, also, in, their, invasions, of, europe, the, turks, used, water, buffaloes, for, hauling, heavy, battering, rams, their, dung, is, used, as, a, fertilizer, and, as, a, fuel, when, dried, around, 26, million, water, buffaloes, are, slaughtered, each, year, for, meat, worldwide, they, contribute, 72, million, tonnes, of, milk, and, three, million, tonnes, of, meat, annually, to, world, food, much, of, it, in, areas, that, are, prone, to, nutritional, imbalances, in, india, river, buffaloes, are, kept, mainly, for, milk, production, and, for, transport, whereas, swamp, buffaloes, are, kept, mainly, for, work, and, a, small, amount, of, milk, water, buffalo, milk, presents, physicochemical, features, different, from, those, of, other, ruminant, species, such, as, a, higher, content, of, fatty, acids, and, proteins, the, physical, and, chemical, parameters, of, swamp, type, and, river, type, water, buffalo, milk, differ, water, buffalo, milk, contains, higher, levels, of, total, solids, crude, protein, fat, calcium, and, phosphorus, and, slightly, higher, content, of, lactose, compared, with, those, of, cow, milk, the, high, level, of, total, solids, makes, water, buffalo, milk, ideal, for, processing, into, value, added, dairy, products, such, as, cheese, the, conjugated, linoleic, acid, content, in, water, buffalo, milk, ranged, from, 4, 4, mg, g, fat, in, september, to, 7, 6, mg, g, fat, in, june, seasons, and, genetics, may, play, a, role, in, variation, of, cla, level, and, changes, in, gross, composition, of, water, buffalo, milk, water, buffalo, milk, is, processed, into, a, large, variety, of, dairy, products, including, water, buffalo, meat, sometimes, called, carabeef, is, often, passed, off, as, beef, in, certain, regions, and, is, also, a, major, source, of, export, revenue, for, india, in, many, asian, regions, water, buffalo, meat, is, less, preferred, due, to, its, toughness, however, recipes, have, evolved, rendang, for, example, where, the, slow, cooking, process, and, spices, not, only, make, the, meat, palatable, but, also, preserve, it, an, important, factor, in, hot, climates, where, refrigeration, is, not, always, available, their, hides, provide, tough, and, useful, leather, often, used, for, shoes, the, bones, and, horns, are, often, made, into, jewellery, especially, earrings, horns, are, used, for, the, embouchure, of, musical, instruments, such, as, ney, and, kaval, wildlife, conservation, scientists, have, started, to, recommend, and, use, introduced, populations, of, feral, water, buffaloes, in, far, away, lands, to, manage, uncontrolled, vegetation, growth, in, and, around, natural, wetlands, introduced, water, buffaloes, at, home, in, such, environs, provide, cheap, service, by, regularly, grazing, the, uncontrolled, vegetation, and, opening, up, clogged, water, bodies, for, waterfowl, wetland, birds, and, other, wildlife, grazing, water, buffaloes, are, sometimes, used, in, great, britain, for, conservation, grazing, such, as, in, the, chippenham, fen, national, nature, reserve, the, water, buffaloes, can, better, adapt, to, wet, conditions, and, poor, quality, vegetation, than, cattle, in, uncontrolled, circumstances, though, water, buffaloes, can, cause, environmental, damage, such, as, trampling, vegetation, disturbing, bird, and, reptile, nesting, sites, and, spreading, exotic, weeds, in, 2004, philippine, carabao, center, pcc, in, nueva, ecija, produced, the, first, swamp, type, water, buffalo, born, from, an, in, vitro, produced, vitrified, embryo, it, was, named, glory, after, president, gloria, macapagal, arroyo, joseph, estrada, s, most, successful, project, as, an, opposition, senator, the, pcc, was, created, through, republic, act, 3707, the, carabao, act, of, 1992, there, have, been, many, attempts, at, creating, hybrids, between, domestic, cattle, and, domestic, water, buffaloes, however, to, date, none, have, been, successful, the, embryos, usually, only, get, to, the, 8, cell, stage, before, failing, the, first, cloned, water, buffalos, were, born, in, 2007, chinese, scientists, used, micromanipulation, based, somatic, cell, nuclear, transfer, scnt, produce, several, clones, of, a, swamp, type, water, buffalo, three, calves, were, born, two, died, young, in, 2007, the, pcc, announced, plans, to, clone, the, swamp, type, water, buffalo, the, plan, was, to, use, as, a, tool, for, genetic, improvement, in, water, buffaloes, to, produce, super, buffalo, calves, by, multiplying, existing, germplasms, but, without, modifying, or, altering, genetic, material, a, 2009, voice, of, america, article, says, the, pcc, is, close, to, producing, the, world, s, first, water, buffalo, clone, in, 2009, national, dairy, research, institute, karnal, india, cloned, a, river, type, water, buffalo, using, a, simplified, scnt, procedure, they, called, handmade, cloning, the, calf, named, samrupa, did, not, survive, more, than, a, week, due, to, genetic, defects, a, few, months, later, a, second, cloned, calf, named, garima, was, successfully, born, the, central, institute, for, research, on, buffaloes, india, s, premier, research, institute, on, water, buffaloes, also, became, the, second, institute, in, the, world, to, successfully, clone, the, water, buffalo, in, 2016
