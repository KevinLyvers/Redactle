chondrichthyes, k, n, d, r, k, i, i, z, from, ancient, greek, kh, ndros, cartilage, and, ikhth, s, fish, is, a, class, of, jawed, fish, that, contains, the, cartilaginous, fish, or, chondrichthyans, which, all, have, skeletons, primarily, composed, of, cartilage, they, can, be, contrasted, with, the, osteichthyes, or, bony, fish, which, have, skeletons, primarily, composed, of, bone, tissue, chondrichthyes, are, aquatic, vertebrates, with, paired, fins, paired, nares, placoid, scales, conus, arteriosus, in, the, heart, and, a, lack, of, opercula, and, swim, bladders, within, the, infraphylum, gnathostomata, cartilaginous, fishes, are, distinct, from, all, other, jawed, vertebrates, the, class, is, divided, into, two, subclasses, elasmobranchii, sharks, rays, skates, and, sawfish, and, holocephali, chimaeras, sometimes, called, ghost, sharks, which, are, sometimes, separated, into, their, own, class, extant, chondrichthyans, range, in, size, from, the, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, finless, sleeper, ray, to, the, over, 10, m, 33, ft, whale, shark, the, skeleton, is, cartilaginous, the, notochord, is, gradually, replaced, by, a, vertebral, column, during, development, except, in, holocephali, where, the, notochord, stays, intact, in, some, deepwater, sharks, the, column, is, reduced, as, they, do, not, have, bone, marrow, red, blood, cells, are, produced, in, the, spleen, and, the, epigonal, organ, special, tissue, around, the, gonads, which, is, also, thought, to, play, a, role, in, the, immune, system, they, are, also, produced, in, the, leydig, s, organ, which, is, only, found, in, certain, cartilaginous, fishes, the, subclass, holocephali, which, is, a, very, specialized, group, lacks, both, the, leydig, s, and, epigonal, organs, apart, from, electric, rays, which, have, a, thick, and, flabby, body, with, soft, loose, skin, chondrichthyans, have, tough, skin, covered, with, dermal, teeth, again, holocephali, is, an, exception, as, the, teeth, are, lost, in, adults, only, kept, on, the, clasping, organ, seen, on, the, caudal, ventral, surface, of, the, male, also, called, placoid, scales, or, dermal, denticles, making, it, feel, like, sandpaper, in, most, species, all, dermal, denticles, are, oriented, in, one, direction, making, the, skin, feel, very, smooth, if, rubbed, in, one, direction, and, very, rough, if, rubbed, in, the, other, originally, the, pectoral, and, pelvic, girdles, which, do, not, contain, any, dermal, elements, did, not, connect, in, later, forms, each, pair, of, fins, became, ventrally, connected, in, the, middle, when, scapulocoracoid, and, puboischiadic, bars, evolved, in, rays, the, pectoral, fins, are, connected, to, the, head, and, are, very, flexible, one, of, the, primary, characteristics, present, in, most, sharks, is, the, heterocercal, tail, which, aids, in, locomotion, chondrichthyans, have, tooth, like, scales, called, dermal, denticles, or, placoid, scales, denticles, usually, provide, protection, and, in, most, cases, streamlining, mucous, glands, exist, in, some, species, as, well, it, is, assumed, that, their, oral, teeth, evolved, from, dermal, denticles, that, migrated, into, the, mouth, but, it, could, be, the, other, way, around, as, the, teleost, bony, fish, denticeps, clupeoides, has, most, of, its, head, covered, by, dermal, teeth, as, does, probably, atherion, elymus, another, bony, fish, this, is, most, likely, a, secondary, evolved, characteristic, which, means, there, is, not, necessarily, a, connection, between, the, teeth, and, the, original, dermal, scales, the, old, placoderms, did, not, have, teeth, at, all, but, had, sharp, bony, plates, in, their, mouth, thus, it, is, unknown, whether, the, dermal, or, oral, teeth, evolved, first, it, has, even, been, suggested, that, the, original, bony, plates, of, all, vertebrates, are, now, gone, and, that, the, present, scales, are, just, modified, teeth, even, if, both, the, teeth, and, body, armor, had, a, common, origin, a, long, time, ago, however, there, is, currently, no, evidence, of, this, all, chondrichthyans, breathe, through, five, to, seven, pairs, of, gills, depending, on, the, species, in, general, pelagic, species, must, keep, swimming, to, keep, oxygenated, water, moving, through, their, gills, whilst, demersal, species, can, actively, pump, water, in, through, their, spiracles, and, out, through, their, gills, however, this, is, only, a, general, rule, and, many, species, differ, a, spiracle, is, a, small, hole, found, behind, each, eye, these, can, be, tiny, and, circular, such, as, found, on, the, nurse, shark, ginglymostoma, cirratum, to, extended, and, slit, like, such, as, found, on, the, wobbegongs, orectolobidae, many, larger, pelagic, species, such, as, the, mackerel, sharks, lamnidae, and, the, thresher, sharks, alopiidae, no, longer, possess, them, in, chondrichthyans, the, nervous, system, is, composed, of, a, small, brain, 8, 10, pairs, of, cranial, nerves, and, a, spinal, cord, with, spinal, nerves, they, have, several, sensory, organs, which, provide, information, to, be, processed, ampullae, of, lorenzini, are, a, network, of, small, jelly, filled, pores, called, electroreceptors, which, help, the, fish, sense, electric, fields, in, water, this, aids, in, finding, prey, navigation, and, sensing, temperature, the, lateral, line, system, has, modified, epithelial, cells, located, externally, which, sense, motion, vibration, and, pressure, in, the, water, around, them, most, species, have, large, well, developed, eyes, also, they, have, very, powerful, nostrils, and, olfactory, organs, their, inner, ears, consist, of, 3, large, semicircular, canals, which, aid, in, balance, and, orientation, their, sound, detecting, apparatus, has, limited, range, and, is, typically, more, powerful, at, lower, frequencies, some, species, have, electric, organs, which, can, be, used, for, defense, and, predation, they, have, relatively, simple, brains, with, the, forebrain, not, greatly, enlarged, the, structure, and, formation, of, myelin, in, their, nervous, systems, are, nearly, identical, to, that, of, tetrapods, which, has, led, evolutionary, biologists, to, believe, that, chondrichthyes, were, a, cornerstone, group, in, the, evolutionary, timeline, of, myelin, development, like, all, other, jawed, vertebrates, members, of, chondrichthyes, have, an, adaptive, immune, system, fertilization, is, internal, development, is, usually, live, birth, ovoviviparous, species, but, can, be, through, eggs, oviparous, some, rare, species, are, viviparous, there, is, no, parental, care, after, birth, however, some, chondrichthyans, do, guard, their, eggs, capture, induced, premature, birth, and, abortion, collectively, called, capture, induced, parturition, occurs, frequently, in, sharks, rays, when, fished, capture, induced, parturition, is, often, mistaken, for, natural, birth, by, recreational, fishers, and, is, rarely, considered, in, commercial, fisheries, management, despite, being, shown, to, occur, in, at, least, 12, of, live, bearing, sharks, and, rays, 88, species, to, date, the, class, chondrichthyes, has, two, subclasses, the, subclass, elasmobranchii, sharks, rays, skates, and, sawfish, and, the, subclass, holocephali, chimaeras, to, see, the, full, list, of, the, species, click, here, the, fossil, record, of, the, holocephali, starts, in, the, devonian, period, the, record, is, extensive, but, most, fossils, are, teeth, and, the, body, forms, of, numerous, species, are, not, known, or, at, best, poorly, understood, position, uncertain, cartilaginous, fish, are, considered, to, have, evolved, from, acanthodians, the, discovery, of, entelognathus, and, several, examinations, of, acanthodian, characteristics, indicate, that, bony, fish, evolved, directly, from, placoderm, like, ancestors, while, acanthodians, represent, a, paraphyletic, assemblage, leading, to, chondrichthyes, some, characteristics, previously, thought, to, be, exclusive, to, acanthodians, are, also, present, in, basal, cartilaginous, fish, in, particular, new, phylogenetic, studies, find, cartilaginous, fish, to, be, well, nested, among, acanthodians, with, doliodus, and, tamiobatis, being, the, closest, relatives, to, chondrichthyes, recent, studies, vindicate, this, as, doliodus, had, a, mosaic, of, chondrichthyan, and, acanthodian, traits, dating, back, to, the, middle, and, late, ordovician, period, many, isolated, scales, made, of, dentine, and, bone, have, a, structure, and, growth, form, that, is, chondrichthyan, like, they, may, be, the, remains, of, stem, chondrichthyans, but, their, classification, remains, uncertain, the, earliest, unequivocal, fossils, of, acanthodian, grade, cartilaginous, fishes, are, qianodus, and, fanjingshania, from, the, early, silurian, aeronian, of, guizhou, china, around, 439, million, years, ago, which, are, also, the, oldest, unambiguous, remains, of, any, jawed, vertebrates, shenacanthus, vermiformis, which, lived, 436, million, years, ago, had, thoracic, armour, plates, resembling, those, of, placoderms, by, the, start, of, the, early, devonian, 419, million, years, ago, jawed, fishes, had, divided, into, three, distinct, groups, the, now, extinct, placoderms, a, paraphyletic, assemblage, of, ancient, armoured, fishes, the, bony, fishes, and, the, clade, that, includes, spiny, sharks, and, early, cartilaginous, fish, the, modern, bony, fishes, class, osteichthyes, appeared, in, the, late, silurian, or, early, devonian, about, 416, million, years, ago, the, first, abundant, genus, of, shark, cladoselache, appeared, in, the, oceans, during, the, devonian, period, the, first, cartilaginous, fishes, evolved, from, doliodus, like, spiny, shark, ancestors, zangerl, 1981
