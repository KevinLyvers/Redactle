94, see, text, the, cyperaceae, s, a, p, r, e, s, i, i, a, are, a, family, of, graminoid, grass, like, monocotyledonous, flowering, plants, known, as, sedges, the, family, is, large, botanists, have, described, some, 5, 500, known, species, in, about, 90, genera, the, largest, being, the, true, sedges, genus, carex, with, over, 2, 000, species, cyperaceae, species, are, widely, distributed, with, the, centers, of, diversity, for, the, group, occurring, in, tropical, asia, and, tropical, south, america, while, sedges, grow, in, almost, all, environments, many, thrive, in, wetlands, or, in, poor, soils, ecological, communities, dominated, by, sedges, are, known, as, sedgelands, or, as, sedge, meadows, some, species, superficially, resemble, the, closely, related, rushes, and, the, more, distantly, related, grasses, features, distinguishing, members, of, the, sedge, family, from, grasses, or, rushes, are, stems, with, triangular, cross, sections, with, occasional, exceptions, a, notable, example, being, the, tule, which, has, a, round, cross, section, and, leaves, that, are, spirally, arranged, in, three, ranks, in, comparison, grasses, have, alternate, leaves, forming, two, ranks, some, well, known, sedges, include, the, water, chestnut, eleocharis, dulcis, and, the, papyrus, sedge, cyperus, papyrus, from, which, the, writing, material, papyrus, was, made, this, family, also, includes, cotton, grass, eriophorum, spike, rush, eleocharis, sawgrass, cladium, nutsedge, or, nutgrass, also, called, chufa, cyperus, esculentus, cyperus, rotundus, a, cultivated, crop, and, common, weed, white, star, sedge, rhynchospora, colorata, and, umbrella, sedge, cyperus, alternifolius, also, known, as, umbrella, papyrus, members, of, this, family, are, characterised, by, the, formation, of, dauciform, carrot, like, roots, an, alteration, in, root, morphology, that, researchers, regard, as, analogous, to, cluster, roots, in, proteaceae, which, help, uptake, of, nutrients, such, as, phosphorus, from, poor, soil, like, other, members, of, the, order, poales, sedges, are, mostly, wind, pollinated, but, there, are, exceptions, cyperus, niveus, and, cyperus, sphaerocephalus, both, with, accordingly, more, conspicuous, flowers, are, insect, pollinated, researchers, have, identified, sedges, occurring, at, least, as, early, as, the, eocene, epoch, as, of, 2024, 93, genera, are, accepted, by, kew, s, plants, of, the, world, online
