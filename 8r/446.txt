leeches, are, segmented, parasitic, or, predatory, worms, that, comprise, the, subclass, hirudinea, within, the, phylum, annelida, they, are, closely, related, to, the, oligochaetes, which, include, the, earthworm, and, like, them, have, soft, muscular, segmented, bodies, that, can, lengthen, and, contract, both, groups, are, hermaphrodites, and, have, a, clitellum, but, leeches, typically, differ, from, the, oligochaetes, in, having, suckers, at, both, ends, and, in, having, ring, markings, that, do, not, correspond, with, their, internal, segmentation, the, body, is, muscular, and, relatively, solid, and, the, coelom, the, spacious, body, cavity, found, in, other, annelids, is, reduced, to, small, channels, the, majority, of, leeches, live, in, freshwater, habitats, while, some, species, can, be, found, in, terrestrial, or, marine, environments, the, best, known, species, such, as, the, medicinal, leech, hirudo, medicinalis, are, hematophagous, attaching, themselves, to, a, host, with, a, sucker, and, feeding, on, blood, having, first, secreted, the, peptide, hirudin, to, prevent, the, blood, from, clotting, the, jaws, used, to, pierce, the, skin, are, replaced, in, other, species, by, a, proboscis, which, is, pushed, into, the, skin, a, minority, of, leech, species, are, predatory, mostly, preying, on, small, invertebrates, the, eggs, are, enclosed, in, a, cocoon, which, in, aquatic, species, is, usually, attached, to, an, underwater, surface, members, of, one, family, glossiphoniidae, exhibit, parental, care, the, eggs, being, brooded, by, the, parent, in, terrestrial, species, the, cocoon, is, often, concealed, under, a, log, in, a, crevice, or, buried, in, damp, soil, almost, seven, hundred, species, of, leech, are, currently, recognised, of, which, some, hundred, are, marine, ninety, terrestrial, and, the, remainder, freshwater, leeches, have, been, used, in, medicine, from, ancient, times, until, the, 19th, century, to, draw, blood, from, patients, in, modern, times, leeches, find, medical, use, in, treatment, of, joint, diseases, such, as, epicondylitis, and, osteoarthritis, extremity, vein, diseases, and, in, microsurgery, while, hirudin, is, used, as, an, anticoagulant, drug, to, treat, blood, clotting, disorders, the, leech, appears, in, the, biblical, book, of, proverbs, as, an, archetype, of, insatiable, greed, the, term, leech, is, used, to, characterise, a, person, who, takes, without, giving, living, at, the, expense, of, others, some, 680, species, of, leech, have, been, described, of, which, around, 100, are, marine, 480, freshwater, and, the, remainder, terrestrial, among, euhirudinea, the, true, leeches, the, smallest, is, about, 1, cm, 1, 2, in, long, and, the, largest, is, the, giant, amazonian, leech, haementeria, ghilianii, which, can, reach, 30, cm, 12, in, except, for, antarctica, leeches, are, found, throughout, the, world, but, are, at, their, most, abundant, in, temperate, lakes, and, ponds, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, majority, of, freshwater, leeches, are, found, in, the, shallow, vegetated, areas, on, the, edges, of, ponds, lakes, and, slow, moving, streams, very, few, species, tolerate, fast, flowing, water, in, their, preferred, habitats, they, may, occur, in, very, high, densities, in, a, favourable, environment, with, water, high, in, organic, pollutants, over, 10, 000, individuals, were, recorded, per, square, metre, over, 930, per, square, foot, under, rocks, in, illinois, some, species, aestivate, during, droughts, burying, themselves, in, the, sediment, and, can, lose, up, to, 90, of, their, bodyweight, and, still, survive, among, the, freshwater, leeches, are, the, glossiphoniidae, dorso, ventrally, flattened, animals, mostly, parasitic, on, vertebrates, such, as, turtles, and, unique, among, annelids, in, both, brooding, their, eggs, and, carrying, their, young, on, the, underside, of, their, bodies, the, terrestrial, haemadipsidae, are, mostly, native, to, the, tropics, and, subtropics, while, the, aquatic, hirudinidae, have, a, wider, global, range, both, of, these, feed, largely, on, mammals, including, humans, a, distinctive, family, is, the, piscicolidae, marine, or, freshwater, ectoparasites, chiefly, of, fish, with, cylindrical, bodies, and, usually, well, marked, bell, shaped, anterior, suckers, not, all, leeches, feed, on, blood, the, erpobdelliformes, freshwater, or, amphibious, are, carnivorous, and, equipped, with, a, relatively, large, toothless, mouth, to, ingest, insect, larvae, molluscs, and, other, annelid, worms, which, are, swallowed, whole, in, turn, leeches, are, prey, to, fish, birds, and, invertebrates, the, name, for, the, subclass, hirudinea, comes, from, the, latin, hirudo, genitive, hirudinis, a, leech, the, element, bdella, found, in, many, leech, group, names, is, from, the, greek, bdella, also, meaning, leech, the, name, les, hirudin, es, was, given, by, jean, baptiste, lamarck, in, 1818, leeches, were, traditionally, divided, into, two, infraclasses, the, acanthobdellidea, primitive, leeches, and, the, euhirudinea, true, leeches, the, euhirudinea, are, divided, into, the, proboscis, bearing, rhynchobdellida, and, the, rest, including, some, jawed, species, the, arhynchobdellida, without, a, proboscis, the, phylogenetic, tree, of, the, leeches, and, their, annelid, relatives, is, based, on, molecular, analysis, 2019, of, dna, sequences, both, the, former, classes, polychaeta, bristly, marine, worms, and, oligochaeta, including, the, earthworms, are, paraphyletic, in, each, case, the, complete, groups, clades, would, include, all, the, other, groups, shown, below, them, in, the, tree, the, branchiobdellida, are, sister, to, the, leech, clade, hirudinida, which, approximately, corresponds, to, the, traditional, subclass, hirudinea, the, main, subdivision, of, leeches, is, into, the, rhynchobdellida, and, the, arhynchobdellida, though, the, acanthobdella, are, sister, to, the, clade, that, contains, these, two, groups, polychaeta, exc, oligochaeta, oligochaeta, exc, lumbriculidae, lumbriculidae, blackworms, acanthobdella, erpobdelliformes, hirudiniformes, glossiphoniidae, piscicolidae, ozobranchidae, the, most, ancient, annelid, group, consists, of, the, free, living, polychaetes, that, evolved, in, the, cambrian, period, being, plentiful, in, the, burgess, shale, about, 500, million, years, ago, oligochaetes, evolved, from, polychaetes, and, the, leeches, branched, off, from, the, oligochaetes, the, oldest, leech, fossils, are, from, the, middle, permian, period, around, 266, million, years, ago, there, is, also, unpublished, study, about, possible, leech, from, virgilian, late, carboniferous, of, new, mexico, although, fossil, with, external, ring, markings, found, from, silurian, strata, in, wisconsin, is, sometimes, identified, as, leech, but, assignment, of, fossil, is, still, putative, and, contentious, and, the, animal, was, also, alternatively, interpreted, as, a, member, of, cycloneuralia, leeches, show, a, remarkable, similarity, to, each, other, in, morphology, very, different, from, typical, annelids, which, are, cylindrical, with, a, fluid, filled, space, the, coelom, body, cavity, in, leeches, most, of, the, coelom, is, filled, with, botryoidal, tissue, a, loose, connective, tissue, composed, of, clusters, of, cells, of, mesodermal, origin, the, remaining, body, cavity, has, been, reduced, to, four, slender, longitudinal, channels, typically, the, body, is, dorso, ventrally, flattened, and, tapers, at, both, ends, longitudinal, and, circular, muscles, in, the, body, wall, are, supplemented, by, diagonal, muscles, giving, the, leech, the, ability, to, adopt, a, large, range, of, body, shapes, and, show, great, flexibility, most, leeches, have, a, sucker, at, both, the, anterior, front, and, posterior, back, ends, but, some, primitive, leeches, have, a, single, sucker, at, the, back, like, most, annelids, with, a, few, exceptions, like, sipuncula, echiura, and, diurodrilus, the, leech, is, a, segmented, animal, but, unlike, other, annelids, the, segmentation, is, masked, by, secondary, external, ring, markings, annuli, the, number, of, annulations, varies, both, between, different, regions, of, the, body, and, between, species, in, one, species, the, body, surface, is, divided, into, 102, annuli, all, leech, species, however, have, 32, segments, called, somites, 34, if, two, head, segments, which, have, different, organization, are, counted, of, these, segments, the, first, five, are, designated, as, the, head, and, include, the, anterior, brain, several, ocelli, eyespots, dorsally, and, the, sucker, ventrally, the, following, 21, mid, body, segments, each, contain, a, nerve, ganglion, and, between, them, contain, two, reproductive, organs, a, single, female, gonopore, and, nine, pairs, of, testes, the, last, seven, segments, contain, the, posterior, brain, and, are, fused, to, form, the, animal, s, tail, sucker, the, septa, that, separates, the, body, segments, and, the, mesenteries, which, in, turn, separates, each, segment, into, a, left, and, right, half, in, the, majority, of, annelids, have, been, lost, in, leeches, except, for, the, primitive, genus, acanthobdella, which, still, have, some, septa, and, mesenteries, the, body, wall, consists, of, a, cuticle, an, epidermis, and, a, thick, layer, of, fibrous, connective, tissue, in, which, are, embedded, the, circular, muscles, the, diagonal, muscles, and, the, powerful, longitudinal, muscles, there, are, also, dorso, ventral, muscles, in, leeches, the, original, blood, vascular, system, has, been, lost, and, replaced, by, the, modified, coelom, known, as, the, haemocoelomic, system, and, the, coelomic, fluid, called, the, haemocoelomic, fluid, has, taken, over, the, role, as, blood, the, haemocoelomic, channels, run, the, full, length, of, the, body, the, two, main, ones, being, on, either, side, part, of, the, lining, epithelium, consists, of, chloragogen, cells, which, are, used, for, the, storage, of, nutrients, and, in, excretion, there, are, 10, to, 17, pairs, of, metanephridia, excretory, organs, in, the, mid, region, of, the, leech, from, these, ducts, typically, lead, to, a, urinary, bladder, which, empties, to, the, outside, at, a, nephridiopore, leeches, are, hermaphrodites, with, the, male, reproductive, organs, the, testes, maturing, first, and, the, ovaries, later, in, hirudinids, a, pair, will, line, up, with, the, clitellar, regions, in, contact, with, the, anterior, end, of, one, leech, pointing, towards, the, posterior, end, of, the, other, this, results, in, the, male, gonopore, of, one, leech, being, in, contact, with, the, female, gonopore, of, the, other, the, penis, passes, a, spermatophore, into, the, female, gonopore, and, sperm, is, transferred, to, and, probably, stored, in, the, vagina, some, jawless, leeches, rhynchobdellida, and, proboscisless, leeches, arhynchobdellida, lack, a, penis, and, in, these, sperm, is, passed, from, one, individual, to, another, by, hypodermic, injection, the, leeches, intertwine, and, grasp, each, other, with, their, suckers, a, spermatophore, is, pushed, by, one, through, the, integument, of, the, other, usually, into, the, clitellar, region, the, sperm, is, liberated, and, passes, to, the, ovisacs, either, through, the, coelomic, channels, or, interstitially, through, specialist, target, tissue, pathways, some, time, after, copulation, the, small, relatively, yolkless, eggs, are, laid, in, most, species, an, albumin, filled, cocoon, is, secreted, by, the, clitellum, and, receives, one, or, more, eggs, as, it, passes, over, the, female, gonopore, in, the, case, of, the, north, american, erpobdella, punctata, the, clutch, size, is, about, five, eggs, and, some, ten, cocoons, are, produced, each, cocoon, is, fixed, to, a, submerged, object, or, in, the, case, of, terrestrial, leeches, deposited, under, a, stone, or, buried, in, damp, soil, the, cocoon, of, hemibdella, soleae, is, attached, to, a, suitable, fish, host, the, glossiphoniids, brood, their, eggs, either, by, attaching, the, cocoon, to, the, substrate, and, covering, it, with, their, ventral, surface, or, by, securing, the, cocoon, to, their, ventral, surface, and, even, carrying, the, newly, hatched, young, to, their, first, meal, when, breeding, most, marine, leeches, leave, their, hosts, and, become, free, living, in, estuaries, here, they, produce, their, cocoons, after, which, the, adults, of, most, species, die, when, the, eggs, hatch, the, juveniles, seek, out, potential, hosts, when, these, approach, the, shore, leeches, mostly, have, an, annual, or, biannual, life, cycle, about, three, quarters, of, leech, species, are, parasites, that, feed, on, the, blood, of, a, host, while, the, remainder, are, predators, leeches, either, have, a, pharynx, that, they, can, protrude, commonly, called, a, proboscis, or, a, pharynx, that, they, cannot, protrude, which, in, some, groups, is, armed, with, jaws, in, the, proboscisless, leeches, the, jaws, if, any, of, arhynchobdellids, are, at, the, front, of, the, mouth, and, have, three, blades, set, at, an, angle, to, each, other, in, feeding, these, slice, their, way, through, the, skin, of, the, host, leaving, a, y, shaped, incision, behind, the, blades, is, the, mouth, located, ventrally, at, the, anterior, end, of, the, body, it, leads, successively, into, the, pharynx, a, short, oesophagus, a, crop, in, some, species, a, stomach, and, a, hindgut, which, ends, at, an, anus, located, just, above, the, posterior, sucker, the, stomach, may, be, a, simple, tube, but, the, crop, when, present, is, an, enlarged, part, of, the, midgut, with, a, number, of, pairs, of, ceca, that, store, ingested, blood, the, leech, secretes, an, anticoagulant, hirudin, in, its, saliva, which, prevents, the, blood, from, clotting, before, ingestion, a, mature, medicinal, leech, may, feed, only, twice, a, year, taking, months, to, digest, a, blood, meal, the, bodies, of, predatory, leeches, are, similar, though, instead, of, a, jaw, many, have, a, protrusible, proboscis, which, for, most, of, the, time, they, keep, retracted, into, the, mouth, such, leeches, are, often, ambush, predators, that, lie, in, wait, until, they, can, strike, prey, with, the, proboscises, in, a, spear, like, fashion, predatory, leeches, feed, on, small, invertebrates, such, as, snails, earthworms, and, insect, larvae, the, prey, is, usually, sucked, in, and, swallowed, whole, some, rhynchobdellida, however, suck, the, soft, tissues, from, their, prey, making, them, intermediate, between, predators, and, blood, suckers, blood, sucking, leeches, use, their, anterior, suckers, to, connect, to, hosts, for, feeding, once, attached, they, use, a, combination, of, mucus, and, suction, to, stay, in, place, while, they, inject, hirudin, into, the, hosts, blood, in, general, blood, feeding, leeches, are, non, host, specific, and, do, little, harm, to, their, host, dropping, off, after, consuming, a, blood, meal, some, marine, species, however, remain, attached, until, it, is, time, to, reproduce, if, present, in, great, numbers, on, a, host, these, can, be, debilitating, and, in, extreme, cases, cause, death, leeches, are, unusual, in, that, they, do, not, produce, certain, digestive, enzymes, such, as, amylases, lipases, or, endopeptidases, a, deficiency, of, these, enzymes, and, of, b, complex, vitamins, is, compensated, for, by, enzymes, and, vitamins, produced, by, endosymbiotic, microflora, in, hirudo, medicinalis, these, supplementary, factors, are, produced, by, an, obligatory, mutualistic, relationship, with, the, bacterial, species, aeromonas, veronii, non, bloodsucking, leeches, such, as, erpobdella, octoculata, are, host, to, more, bacterial, symbionts, in, addition, leeches, produce, intestinal, exopeptidases, which, remove, amino, acids, from, the, long, protein, molecules, one, by, one, possibly, aided, by, proteases, from, endosymbiotic, bacteria, in, the, hindgut, this, evolutionary, choice, of, exopeptic, digestion, in, hirudinea, distinguishes, these, carnivorous, clitellates, from, oligochaetes, and, may, explain, why, digestion, in, leeches, is, so, slow, a, leech, s, nervous, system, is, formed, of, a, few, large, nerve, cells, their, large, size, makes, leeches, convenient, as, model, organisms, for, the, study, of, invertebrate, nervous, systems, the, main, nerve, centre, consists, of, the, cerebral, ganglion, above, the, gut, and, another, ganglion, beneath, it, with, connecting, nerves, forming, a, ring, around, the, pharynx, a, little, way, behind, the, mouth, a, nerve, cord, runs, backwards, from, this, in, the, ventral, coelomic, channel, with, 21, pairs, of, ganglia, in, segments, six, to, 26, in, segments, 27, to, 33, other, paired, ganglia, fuse, to, form, the, caudal, ganglion, several, sensory, nerves, connect, directly, to, the, cerebral, ganglion, there, are, sensory, and, motor, nerve, cells, connected, to, the, ventral, nerve, cord, ganglia, in, each, segment, leeches, have, between, two, and, ten, pigment, spot, ocelli, arranged, in, pairs, towards, the, front, of, the, body, there, are, also, sensory, papillae, arranged, in, a, lateral, row, in, one, annulation, of, each, segment, each, papilla, contains, many, sensory, cells, some, rhynchobdellids, have, the, ability, to, change, colour, dramatically, by, moving, pigment, in, chromatophore, cells, this, process, is, under, the, control, of, the, nervous, system, but, its, function, is, unclear, as, the, change, in, hue, seems, unrelated, to, the, colour, of, the, surroundings, leeches, can, detect, touch, vibration, movement, of, nearby, objects, and, chemicals, secreted, by, their, hosts, freshwater, leeches, crawl, or, swim, towards, a, potential, host, standing, in, their, pond, within, a, few, seconds, species, that, feed, on, warm, blooded, hosts, move, towards, warmer, objects, many, leeches, avoid, light, though, some, blood, feeders, move, towards, light, when, they, are, ready, to, feed, presumably, increasing, the, chances, of, finding, a, host, leeches, live, in, damp, surroundings, and, in, general, respire, through, their, body, wall, the, exception, to, this, is, in, the, piscicolidae, where, branching, or, leaf, like, lateral, outgrowths, from, the, body, wall, form, gills, some, rhynchobdellid, leeches, have, an, extracellular, haemoglobin, pigment, but, this, only, provides, for, about, half, of, the, leech, s, oxygen, transportation, needs, the, rest, occurring, by, diffusion, leeches, move, using, their, longitudinal, and, circular, muscles, in, a, modification, of, the, locomotion, by, peristalsis, self, propulsion, by, alternately, contracting, and, lengthening, parts, of, the, body, seen, in, other, annelids, such, as, earthworms, they, use, their, posterior, and, anterior, suckers, one, on, each, end, of, the, body, to, enable, them, to, progress, by, looping, or, inching, along, in, the, manner, of, geometer, moth, caterpillars, the, posterior, end, is, attached, to, the, substrate, and, the, anterior, end, is, projected, forward, peristaltically, by, the, circular, muscles, until, it, touches, down, as, far, as, it, can, reach, and, the, anterior, end, is, attached, then, the, posterior, end, is, released, pulled, forward, by, the, longitudinal, muscles, and, reattached, then, the, anterior, end, is, released, and, the, cycle, repeats, leeches, explore, their, environment, with, head, movements, and, body, waving, the, hirudinidae, and, erpobdellidae, can, swim, rapidly, with, up, and, down, or, sideways, undulations, of, the, body, the, glossiphoniidae, in, contrast, are, poor, swimmers, and, curl, up, and, fall, to, the, sediment, below, when, disturbed, leech, bites, are, generally, alarming, rather, than, dangerous, though, a, small, percentage, of, people, have, severe, allergic, or, anaphylactic, reactions, and, require, urgent, medical, care, symptoms, of, these, reactions, include, red, blotches, or, an, itchy, rash, over, the, body, swelling, around, the, lips, or, eyes, a, feeling, of, faintness, or, dizziness, and, difficulty, in, breathing, an, externally, attached, leech, will, detach, and, fall, off, on, its, own, accord, when, it, is, satiated, on, blood, which, may, take, from, twenty, minutes, to, a, few, hours, bleeding, from, the, wound, may, continue, for, some, time, internal, attachments, such, as, inside, the, nose, are, more, likely, to, require, medical, intervention, bacteria, viruses, and, protozoan, parasites, from, previous, blood, sources, can, survive, within, a, leech, for, months, so, leeches, could, potentially, act, as, vectors, of, pathogens, nevertheless, only, a, few, cases, of, leeches, transmitting, pathogens, to, humans, have, been, reported, leech, saliva, is, commonly, believed, to, contain, anaesthetic, compounds, to, numb, the, bite, area, but, some, authorities, disagree, although, morphine, like, substances, have, been, found, in, leeches, they, have, been, found, in, the, neural, tissues, not, the, salivary, tissues, they, are, used, by, the, leeches, in, modulating, their, own, immunocytes, and, not, for, anaesthetising, bite, areas, on, their, hosts, depending, on, the, species, and, size, leech, bites, can, be, barely, noticeable, or, they, can, be, fairly, painful, the, medicinal, leech, hirudo, medicinalis, and, some, other, species, have, been, used, for, clinical, bloodletting, for, at, least, 2, 500, years, ayurvedic, texts, describe, their, use, for, bloodletting, in, ancient, india, in, ancient, greece, bloodletting, was, practised, according, to, the, theory, of, humours, found, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, of, the, fifth, century, bc, which, maintained, that, health, depended, on, a, balance, of, the, four, humours, blood, phlegm, black, bile, and, yellow, bile, bloodletting, using, leeches, enabled, physicians, to, restore, balance, if, they, considered, blood, was, present, in, excess, pliny, the, elder, reported, in, his, natural, history, that, the, horse, leech, could, drive, elephants, mad, by, climbing, up, inside, their, trunks, to, drink, blood, pliny, also, noted, the, medicinal, use, of, leeches, in, ancient, rome, stating, that, they, were, often, used, for, gout, and, that, patients, became, addicted, to, the, treatment, in, old, english, l, ce, was, the, name, for, a, physician, as, well, as, for, the, animal, though, the, words, had, different, origins, and, l, cecraft, leechcraft, was, the, art, of, healing, william, wordsworth, s, 1802, poem, resolution, and, independence, describes, one, of, the, last, of, the, leech, gatherers, people, who, travelled, britain, catching, leeches, from, the, wild, and, causing, a, sharp, decline, in, their, abundance, though, they, remain, numerous, in, romney, marsh, by, 1863, british, hospitals, had, switched, to, imported, leeches, some, seven, million, being, imported, to, hospitals, in, london, that, year, in, the, nineteenth, century, demand, for, leeches, was, sufficient, for, hirudiculture, the, farming, of, leeches, to, become, commercially, viable, leech, usage, declined, with, the, demise, of, humoral, theory, but, made, a, small, scale, comeback, in, the, 1980s, after, years, of, decline, with, the, advent, of, microsurgery, where, venous, congestion, can, arise, due, to, inefficient, venous, drainage, leeches, can, reduce, swelling, in, the, tissues, and, promote, healing, helping, in, particular, to, restore, circulation, after, microsurgery, to, reattach, body, parts, other, clinical, applications, include, varicose, veins, muscle, cramps, thrombophlebitis, and, joint, diseases, such, as, epicondylitis, and, osteoarthritis, leech, secretions, contain, several, bioactive, substances, with, anti, inflammatory, anticoagulant, and, antimicrobial, effects, one, active, component, of, leech, saliva, is, a, small, protein, hirudin, it, is, widely, used, as, an, anticoagulant, drug, to, treat, blood, clotting, disorders, and, manufactured, by, recombinant, dna, technology, in, 2012, and, 2018, ida, schnell, and, colleagues, trialled, the, use, of, haemadipsa, leeches, to, gather, data, on, the, biodiversity, of, their, mammalian, hosts, in, the, tropical, rainforest, of, vietnam, where, it, is, hard, to, obtain, reliable, data, on, rare, and, cryptic, mammals, they, showed, that, mammal, mitochondrial, dna, amplified, by, the, polymerase, chain, reaction, can, be, identified, from, a, leech, s, blood, meal, for, at, least, four, months, after, feeding, they, detected, annamite, striped, rabbit, small, toothed, ferret, badger, truong, son, muntjac, and, serow, in, this, way, exposure, to, synthetic, estrogen, as, used, in, contraceptive, medicines, which, may, enter, freshwater, ecosystems, from, municipal, wastewater, can, affect, leeches, reproductive, systems, although, not, as, sensitive, to, these, compounds, as, fish, leeches, showed, physiological, changes, after, exposure, including, longer, sperm, sacs, and, vaginal, bulbs, and, decreased, epididymis, weight
