homo, erectus, h, o, m, o, r, k, t, s, meaning, upright, man, is, an, extinct, species, of, archaic, human, from, the, pleistocene, with, its, earliest, occurrence, about, 2, million, years, ago, its, specimens, are, among, the, first, recognizable, members, of, the, genus, homo, several, human, species, such, as, h, heidelbergensis, and, h, antecessor, appear, to, have, evolved, from, h, erectus, and, neanderthals, denisovans, and, modern, humans, are, in, turn, generally, considered, to, have, evolved, from, h, heidelbergensis, h, erectus, was, the, first, human, ancestor, to, spread, throughout, eurasia, with, a, continental, range, extending, from, the, iberian, peninsula, to, java, asian, populations, of, h, erectus, may, be, ancestral, to, h, floresiensis, and, possibly, to, h, luzonensis, the, last, known, population, of, h, erectus, is, h, e, soloensis, from, java, around, 117, 000, 108, 000, years, ago, h, erectus, had, a, more, modern, gait, and, body, proportions, and, was, the, first, human, species, to, have, exhibited, a, flat, face, prominent, nose, and, possibly, sparse, body, hair, coverage, though, the, species, brain, size, certainly, exceeds, that, of, ancestor, species, capacity, varied, widely, depending, on, the, population, in, earlier, populations, brain, development, seemed, to, cease, early, in, childhood, suggesting, that, offspring, were, largely, self, sufficient, at, birth, thus, limiting, cognitive, development, through, life, h, erectus, was, an, apex, predator, sites, generally, show, consumption, of, medium, to, large, animals, such, as, bovines, or, elephants, and, suggest, the, development, of, predatory, behavior, and, coordinated, hunting, h, erectus, is, associated, with, the, acheulean, stone, tool, industry, and, is, postulated, to, have, been, the, earliest, human, ancestor, capable, of, using, fire, hunting, and, gathering, in, coordinated, groups, caring, for, injured, or, sick, group, members, and, possibly, seafaring, and, art, though, examples, of, art, are, controversial, and, are, otherwise, rudimentary, and, few, and, far, between, intentional, seafaring, has, also, been, a, controversial, claim, h, erectus, males, and, females, may, have, been, roughly, the, same, size, as, each, other, i, e, exhibited, reduced, sexual, dimorphism, which, could, indicate, monogamy, in, line, with, general, trends, exhibited, in, primates, size, nonetheless, ranged, widely, from, 146, 185, cm, 4, ft, 9, in, 6, ft, 1, in, in, height, and, 40, 68, kg, 88, 150, lb, in, weight, it, is, unclear, if, h, erectus, was, anatomically, capable, of, speech, though, it, is, postulated, they, communicated, using, some, proto, language, contrary, to, the, view, charles, darwin, expressed, in, his, 1871, book, descent, of, man, many, late, 19th, century, evolutionary, naturalists, postulated, that, asia, not, africa, was, the, birthplace, of, humankind, as, it, is, midway, between, europe, and, america, providing, optimal, dispersal, routes, throughout, the, world, the, out, of, asia, theory, among, these, was, german, naturalist, ernst, haeckel, who, argued, that, the, first, human, species, evolved, on, the, now, disproven, hypothetical, continent, lemuria, in, what, is, now, southeast, asia, from, a, species, he, termed, pithecanthropus, alalus, speechless, apeman, lemuria, had, supposedly, sunk, below, the, indian, ocean, so, no, fossils, could, be, found, to, prove, this, nevertheless, haeckel, s, model, inspired, dutch, scientist, eug, ne, dubois, to, journey, to, the, dutch, east, indies, because, no, directed, expedition, had, ever, discovered, human, fossils, the, few, known, had, all, been, discovered, by, accident, and, the, economy, was, strained, by, the, long, depression, the, dutch, government, refused, to, fund, dubois, in, 1887, he, enlisted, in, the, dutch, east, india, army, as, a, medical, officer, and, was, able, to, secure, a, post, in, 1887, in, the, indies, to, search, for, his, missing, link, in, his, spare, time, on, java, he, found, a, skullcap, in, 1891, and, a, femur, in, 1892, java, man, dating, to, the, late, pliocene, or, early, pleistocene, at, the, trinil, site, along, the, solo, river, which, he, named, pithecanthropus, erectus, upright, apeman, in, 1893, he, attempted, unsuccessfully, to, convince, the, european, scientific, community, that, he, had, found, an, upright, walking, ape, man, given, few, fossils, of, ancient, humans, had, even, been, discovered, at, the, time, they, largely, dismissed, his, findings, as, a, malformed, non, human, ape, the, significance, of, these, fossils, would, not, be, realized, until, the, 1927, discovery, of, what, canadian, paleoanthropologist, davidson, black, called, sinanthropus, pekinensis, peking, man, at, the, zhoukoudian, cave, near, beijing, china, black, lobbied, across, north, america, and, europe, for, funding, to, continue, excavating, the, site, which, has, since, become, the, most, productive, h, erectus, site, in, the, world, continued, interest, in, java, led, to, further, h, erectus, fossil, discoveries, at, ngandong, solo, man, in, 1931, mojokerto, java, man, in, 1936, and, sangiran, java, man, in, 1937, the, sangiran, site, yielded, the, best, preserved, java, man, skull, german, paleoanthropologist, franz, weidenreich, provided, much, of, the, detailed, description, of, the, chinese, specimens, in, several, monographs, the, original, specimens, were, lost, during, the, second, sino, japanese, war, after, an, attempt, to, smuggle, them, out, of, china, for, safekeeping, only, casts, remain, similarities, between, java, man, and, peking, man, led, ernst, mayr, to, rename, both, as, homo, erectus, in, 1950, throughout, much, of, the, 20th, century, anthropologists, debated, the, role, of, h, erectus, in, human, evolution, early, in, the, century, due, in, part, to, the, discoveries, at, java, and, zhoukoudian, the, belief, that, modern, humans, first, evolved, in, asia, was, widely, accepted, a, few, naturalists, charles, darwin, the, most, prominent, among, them, theorized, that, humans, earliest, ancestors, were, african, darwin, had, pointed, out, that, chimpanzees, and, gorillas, humans, closest, relatives, evolved, and, exist, only, in, africa, darwin, did, not, include, orangutans, among, the, great, apes, of, the, old, world, likely, because, he, thought, of, orangutans, as, primitive, humans, rather, than, apes, while, darwin, considered, africa, as, the, most, probable, birthplace, of, human, ancestors, he, also, made, the, following, statement, about, the, geographic, location, of, human, origins, in, his, book, the, descent, of, man, and, selection, in, relation, to, sex, it, is, useless, to, speculate, on, this, subject, for, two, or, three, anthropomorphous, apes, one, the, dryopithecus, existed, in, europe, during, the, miocene, age, and, since, so, remote, a, period, the, earth, has, certainly, undergone, many, great, revolutions, and, there, has, been, ample, time, for, migration, on, the, largest, scale, 1889, pp, 155, 156, in, 1949, the, species, was, reported, in, swartkrans, cave, south, africa, by, south, african, paleoanthropologists, robert, broom, and, john, talbot, robinson, who, described, it, as, telanthropus, capensis, homo, fossils, have, also, been, reported, from, nearby, caves, but, their, species, designation, has, been, a, tumultuous, discussion, a, few, north, african, sites, have, additionally, yielded, h, erectus, remains, which, at, first, were, classified, as, atlantanthropus, mauritanicus, in, 1951, beginning, in, the, 1970s, propelled, most, notably, by, richard, leakey, more, were, being, unearthed, in, east, africa, predominantly, at, the, koobi, fora, site, kenya, and, olduvai, gorge, tanzania, archaic, human, fossils, unearthed, across, europe, used, to, be, assigned, to, h, erectus, but, have, since, been, separated, as, h, heidelbergensis, as, a, result, of, british, physical, anthropologist, chris, stringer, s, work, it, has, been, proposed, that, h, erectus, evolved, from, h, habilis, about, 2, mya, though, this, has, been, called, into, question, because, they, coexisted, for, at, least, a, half, a, million, years, alternatively, a, group, of, h, habilis, may, have, been, reproductively, isolated, and, only, this, group, developed, into, h, erectus, cladogenesis, because, the, earliest, remains, of, h, erectus, are, found, in, both, africa, and, east, asia, in, china, as, early, as, 2, 1, mya, in, south, africa, 2, 04, mya, it, is, debated, where, h, erectus, evolved, a, 2011, study, suggested, that, it, was, h, habilis, who, reached, west, asia, from, africa, that, early, h, erectus, developed, there, and, that, early, h, erectus, would, then, have, dispersed, from, west, asia, to, east, asia, peking, man, southeast, asia, java, man, back, to, africa, homo, ergaster, and, to, europe, tautavel, man, eventually, evolving, into, modern, humans, in, africa, others, have, suggested, that, h, erectus, h, ergaster, developed, in, africa, where, it, eventually, evolved, into, modern, humans, h, erectus, had, reached, sangiran, java, by, 1, 5, mya, and, a, second, and, distinct, wave, of, h, erectus, had, colonized, zhoukoudian, china, about, 780, kya, thousand, years, ago, early, teeth, from, sangiran, are, bigger, and, more, similar, to, those, of, basal, ancestral, western, h, erectus, and, h, habilis, than, to, those, of, the, derived, zhoukoudian, h, erectus, however, later, sangiran, teeth, seem, to, reduce, in, size, which, could, indicate, a, secondary, colonization, event, of, java, by, the, zhoukoudian, or, some, closely, related, population, wushan, man, was, proposed, as, homo, erectus, wushanensis, but, is, now, thought, to, be, based, upon, fossilized, fragments, of, an, extinct, non, hominin, ape, since, the, discovery, of, java, man, in, 1893, there, has, been, a, trend, in, paleoanthropology, of, reducing, the, number, of, proposed, species, of, homo, to, the, point, where, h, erectus, includes, all, early, lower, paleolithic, forms, of, homo, sufficiently, derived, from, h, habilis, and, distinct, from, early, h, heidelbergensis, in, africa, also, known, as, h, rhodesiensis, it, is, sometimes, considered, as, a, wide, ranging, polymorphous, species, due, to, such, a, wide, range, of, variation, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, ancient, h, rudolfensis, and, h, habilis, should, be, considered, early, varieties, of, h, erectus, the, primitive, h, e, georgicus, from, dmanisi, georgia, has, the, smallest, brain, capacity, of, any, known, pleistocene, hominin, about, 600, cc, and, its, inclusion, in, the, species, would, greatly, expand, the, range, of, variation, of, h, erectus, to, perhaps, include, species, as, h, rudolfensis, h, gautengensis, h, ergaster, and, perhaps, h, habilis, however, a, 2015, study, suggested, that, h, georgicus, represents, an, earlier, more, primitive, species, of, homo, derived, from, an, older, dispersal, of, hominins, from, africa, with, h, ergaster, erectus, possibly, deriving, from, a, later, dispersal, h, georgicus, is, sometimes, not, even, regarded, as, h, erectus, it, is, debated, whether, the, african, h, e, ergaster, is, a, separate, species, and, that, h, erectus, evolved, in, asia, then, migrated, to, africa, or, is, the, african, form, sensu, lato, of, h, erectus, sensu, stricto, in, the, latter, h, ergaster, has, also, been, suggested, to, represent, the, immediate, ancestor, of, h, erectus, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, h, ergaster, instead, of, h, erectus, or, some, hybrid, between, the, two, was, the, immediate, ancestor, of, other, archaic, humans, and, modern, humans, it, has, been, proposed, that, asian, h, erectus, have, several, unique, characteristics, from, non, asian, populations, autapomorphies, but, there, is, no, clear, consensus, on, what, these, characteristics, are, or, if, they, are, indeed, limited, to, only, asia, based, on, supposed, derived, characteristics, the, 120, kya, javan, h, e, soloensis, has, been, proposed, to, have, speciated, from, h, erectus, as, h, soloensis, but, this, has, been, challenged, because, most, of, the, basic, cranial, features, are, maintained, in, a, wider, sense, h, erectus, had, mostly, been, replaced, by, h, heidelbergensis, by, about, 300, kya, with, possible, late, survival, of, h, erectus, soloensis, in, java, an, estimated, 117, 108, kya, homo, erectus, is, the, most, long, lived, species, of, homo, having, survived, for, almost, two, million, years, by, contrast, homo, sapiens, emerged, about, a, third, of, a, million, years, ago, regarding, many, archaic, humans, there, is, no, definite, consensus, as, to, whether, they, should, be, classified, as, subspecies, of, h, erectus, or, h, sapiens, or, as, separate, species, meganthropus, based, on, fossils, found, in, java, dated, to, between, 1, 4, and, 0, 9, mya, was, tentatively, grouped, with, h, erectus, in, contrast, to, earlier, interpretations, of, it, as, a, giant, species, of, early, human, although, older, literature, has, placed, the, fossils, outside, of, homo, altogether, however, zanolli, et, al, 2019, judged, meganthropus, to, be, a, distinct, genus, of, extinct, ape, homo, erectus, featured, a, flat, face, compared, to, earlier, hominins, pronounced, brow, ridge, and, a, low, flat, skull, the, presence, of, sagittal, frontal, and, coronal, keels, which, are, small, crests, that, run, along, these, suture, lines, has, been, proposed, to, be, evidence, of, significant, thickening, of, the, skull, specifically, the, cranial, vault, ct, scan, analyses, reveal, this, to, not, be, the, case, however, the, squamous, part, of, occipital, bone, particularly, the, internal, occipital, crest, at, the, rear, of, the, skull, is, notably, thicker, than, that, of, modern, humans, likely, a, basal, ancestral, trait, the, fossil, record, indicates, that, h, erectus, was, the, first, human, species, to, have, featured, a, projecting, nose, which, is, generally, thought, to, have, evolved, in, response, to, breathing, dry, air, in, order, to, retain, moisture, american, psychologist, lucia, jacobs, hypothesized, that, the, projecting, nose, instead, allowed, for, distinguishing, the, direction, different, smells, come, from, stereo, olfaction, to, facilitate, navigation, and, long, distance, migration, the, average, brain, size, of, asian, h, erectus, is, about, 1, 000, cc, 61, cu, in, however, markedly, smaller, specimens, have, been, found, in, dmanisi, georgia, h, e, georgicus, koobi, fora, and, olorgesailie, kenya, and, possibly, gona, ethiopia, overall, h, erectus, brain, size, varies, from, 546, 1, 251, cc, 33, 3, 76, 3, cu, in, which, is, greater, than, the, range, of, variation, seen, in, modern, humans, and, chimps, though, less, than, that, of, gorillas, in, an, article, published, in, 2021, titled, interpopulational, variation, in, human, brain, size, implications, for, hominin, cognitive, phylogeny, it, was, found, that, the, brain, size, of, asian, h, erectus, over, the, last, 600, 000, years, overlaps, significantly, with, modern, human, populations, significantly, some, small, brained, modern, populations, showed, greater, affinity, with, h, erectus, than, they, did, with, other, large, brained, and, large, bodied, modern, populations, the, paper, points, out, methodological, flaws, in, current, understanding, of, brain, size, increase, in, human, evolution, where, species, averages, are, compared, with, fossils, which, overlooks, interpopulational, variation, it, also, overlooks, the, fact, that, some, modern, populations, have, not, seen, any, dramatic, brain, size, increase, relative, to, h, erectus, with, most, of, the, increase, occurring, in, northern, populations, which, has, the, result, of, obscuring, interpopulational, variation, as, the, authors, write, the, increase, in, the, mean, of, h, sapiens, cranial, capacity, is, to, a, large, extent, due, to, an, increase, in, the, upper, limit, with, a, much, less, pronounced, increase, in, the, lower, limit, relative, to, our, h, erectus, sample, and, this, increase, in, the, upper, limit, seems, to, be, more, pronounced, in, northern, populations, which, may, be, a, result, of, correlated, increases, in, body, size, in, addition, to, climatic, factors, consequently, the, authors, argue, that, purely, based, on, brain, size, similarities, asian, h, erectus, could, be, re, classified, as, a, subspecies, of, h, sapiens, that, is, h, sapiens, soloensis, as, was, suggested, by, earlier, authors, dentally, h, erectus, have, the, thinnest, enamel, of, any, plio, pleistocene, hominin, enamel, prevents, the, tooth, from, breaking, from, hard, foods, but, impedes, shearing, through, tough, foods, the, bodies, of, the, mandibles, of, h, erectus, and, all, early, homo, are, thicker, than, those, of, modern, humans, and, all, living, apes, the, mandibular, body, resists, torsion, from, the, bite, force, or, chewing, meaning, their, jaws, could, produce, unusually, powerful, stresses, while, eating, but, the, practical, application, of, this, is, unclear, nonetheless, the, mandibular, bodies, of, h, erectus, are, somewhat, thinner, than, those, of, early, homo, the, premolars, and, molars, also, have, a, higher, frequency, of, pits, than, h, habilis, suggesting, h, erectus, ate, more, brittle, foods, which, cause, pitting, these, all, indicate, that, the, h, erectus, mouth, was, less, capable, of, processing, hard, foods, and, more, at, shearing, through, tougher, foods, thus, reducing, the, variety, of, foods, it, could, process, likely, as, a, response, to, tool, use, like, modern, humans, h, erectus, varied, widely, in, size, ranging, from, 146, 185, cm, 4, ft, 9, in, 6, ft, 1, in, in, height, and, 40, 68, kg, 88, 150, lb, in, weight, thought, to, be, due, to, regional, differences, in, climate, mortality, rates, or, nutrition, among, primates, this, marked, of, a, response, to, environmental, stressors, phenotypic, plasticity, is, only, demonstrated, in, modern, humans, like, modern, humans, and, unlike, other, great, apes, there, does, not, seem, to, have, been, a, great, size, disparity, between, h, erectus, males, and, females, size, specific, sexual, dimorphism, though, there, is, not, much, fossil, data, regarding, this, brain, size, in, two, adults, from, koobi, fora, measured, 848, and, 804, cc, 51, 7, and, 49, 1, cu, in, and, another, significantly, smaller, adult, measured, 691, cc, 42, 2, cu, in, which, could, possibly, indicate, sexual, dimorphism, though, sex, was, undetermined, another, case, that, depicts, the, difficulty, of, assigning, sex, to, the, fossil, record, is, a, few, samples, taken, in, olduvai, gorge, in, 1960, in, olduvai, gorge, two, skulls, identified, as, oh12, and, oh9, were, found, to, be, that, of, h, erectus, with, a, cranial, capacities, of, 1000, cc, and, 700, cc, it, is, unclear, if, sexual, dimorphism, is, at, play, here, since, the, remains, are, fragmentary, if, h, erectus, did, not, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, then, it, is, possible, that, they, were, the, first, in, the, human, line, to, do, so, though, the, fragmentary, fossil, record, for, earlier, species, makes, this, unclear, if, yes, then, there, was, a, substantial, and, sudden, increase, in, female, height, certain, features, of, sexual, dimorphism, are, often, identified, in, the, possibility, of, determining, sex, such, as, lack, of, muscle, marking, h, erectus, had, about, the, same, limb, configurations, and, proportions, as, modern, humans, implying, humanlike, locomotion, the, first, in, the, homo, lineage, h, erectus, tracks, near, ileret, kenya, also, indicate, a, human, gait, a, humanlike, shoulder, suggests, an, ability, for, high, speed, throwing, it, was, once, thought, that, turkana, boy, had, 6, lumbar, vertebra, instead, of, the, 5, seen, in, modern, humans, and, 11, instead, of, 12, thoracic, vertebrae, but, this, has, since, been, revised, and, the, specimen, is, now, considered, to, have, exhibited, a, humanlike, curvature, of, the, spine, lordosis, and, the, same, number, of, respective, vertebrae, it, is, largely, unclear, when, human, ancestors, lost, most, of, their, body, hair, genetic, analysis, suggests, that, high, activity, in, the, melanocortin, 1, receptor, which, would, produce, dark, skin, dates, back, to, 1, 2, mya, this, could, indicate, the, evolution, of, hairlessness, around, this, time, as, a, lack, of, body, hair, would, have, left, the, skin, exposed, to, harmful, uv, radiation, it, is, possible, that, exposed, skin, only, became, maladaptive, in, the, pleistocene, because, the, increasing, tilt, of, the, earth, which, also, caused, the, ice, ages, would, have, increased, solar, radiation, bombardment, which, would, suggest, that, hairlessness, first, emerged, in, the, australopithecines, however, australopithecines, seem, to, have, lived, at, much, higher, much, colder, elevations, typically, 1, 000, 1, 600, m, 3, 300, 5, 200, ft, where, the, nighttime, temperature, can, drop, to, 10, or, 5, c, 50, or, 41, f, so, they, may, have, required, hair, to, stay, warm, unlike, early, homo, which, inhabited, lower, hotter, elevations, populations, in, higher, latitudes, potentially, developed, lighter, skin, to, prevent, vitamin, d, deficiency, a, 500, 300, kya, h, erectus, specimen, from, turkey, was, diagnosed, with, the, earliest, known, case, of, tuberculous, meningitis, which, is, typically, exacerbated, in, dark, skinned, people, living, in, higher, latitudes, due, to, vitamin, d, deficiency, hairlessness, is, generally, thought, to, have, facilitated, sweating, but, reduction, of, parasite, load, and, sexual, selection, have, also, been, proposed, the, 1, 8, ma, mojokerto, child, specimen, from, java, who, died, at, about, 1, year, of, age, presented, 72, 84, of, the, average, adult, brain, size, which, is, more, similar, to, the, faster, brain, growth, trajectory, of, great, apes, than, modern, humans, this, indicates, that, h, erectus, was, probably, not, cognitively, comparable, to, modern, humans, and, that, secondary, altriciality, an, extended, childhood, and, long, period, of, dependency, due, to, the, great, amount, of, time, required, for, brain, maturation, evolved, much, later, in, human, evolution, perhaps, in, the, modern, human, neanderthal, last, common, ancestor, it, was, previously, believed, that, based, on, the, narrow, pelvis, of, turkana, boy, h, erectus, could, only, safely, deliver, a, baby, with, a, brain, volume, of, about, 230, cc, 14, cu, in, equating, to, a, similar, brain, growth, rate, as, modern, humans, to, achieve, the, average, adult, brain, size, of, 600, 1, 067, cc, 36, 6, 65, 1, cu, in, however, a, 1, 8, ma, female, pelvis, from, gona, ethiopia, shows, that, h, erectus, babies, with, a, brain, volume, of, 310, cc, 19, cu, in, could, have, been, safely, delivered, which, is, 34, 36, the, mean, adult, size, compared, to, 40, in, chimps, and, 28, in, modern, humans, this, more, aligns, with, the, conclusions, drawn, from, the, mojokerto, child, a, faster, development, rate, could, indicate, a, lower, expected, lifespan, based, on, an, average, mass, of, 63, kg, 139, lb, for, males, and, 52, 3, kg, 115, lb, for, females, the, daily, energy, expenditure, dee, the, amount, of, calories, metabolized, in, one, day, was, estimated, to, be, about, 2271, 8, and, 1909, 5, kcal, respectively, this, is, similar, to, that, of, earlier, homo, despite, a, marked, increase, in, activity, and, migratory, capacity, likely, because, the, longer, legs, of, h, erectus, were, more, energy, efficient, in, long, distance, movement, nonetheless, the, estimate, for, h, erectus, females, is, 84, higher, than, that, for, australopithecus, females, possibly, due, to, an, increased, body, size, and, a, decreased, growth, rate, a, 2011, study, assuming, high, energy, or, dietary, fat, requirements, based, on, the, abundance, of, large, game, animals, at, h, erectus, sites, calculated, a, dee, of, 2, 700, 3, 400, kcal, of, which, 27, 44, derived, from, fat, and, 44, 62, of, the, fat, from, animal, sources, in, comparison, modern, humans, with, a, similar, activity, level, have, a, dee, of, 2, 450, calories, of, which, 33, derives, from, fat, and, 49, of, the, fat, from, animals, the, cortical, bone, the, outer, layer, of, the, bone, is, extraordinarily, thickened, particularly, in, east, asian, populations, the, skullcaps, have, oftentimes, been, confused, with, fossil, turtle, carapaces, and, the, medullary, canal, in, the, long, bones, where, the, bone, marrow, is, stored, in, the, limbs, is, extremely, narrowed, medullary, stenosis, this, degree, of, thickening, is, usually, exhibited, in, semi, aquatic, animals, which, used, their, heavy, pachyosteosclerotic, bones, as, ballasts, to, help, them, sink, induced, by, hypothyroidism, male, specimens, have, thicker, cortical, bone, than, females, it, is, largely, unclear, what, function, this, could, have, served, all, pathological, inducers, would, leave, scarring, or, some, other, indicator, not, normally, exhibited, in, h, erectus, before, more, complete, skeletons, were, discovered, weidenreich, suggested, h, erectus, was, a, gigantic, species, thickened, bone, required, to, support, the, massive, weight, it, was, hypothesized, that, intense, physical, activity, could, have, induced, bone, thickening, but, in, 1970, human, biologist, stanley, marion, garn, demonstrated, there, is, a, low, correlation, between, the, two, at, least, in, modern, humans, garn, instead, noted, different, races, have, different, average, cortical, bone, thicknesses, and, concluded, it, is, genetic, rather, than, environmental, it, is, unclear, if, the, condition, is, caused, by, increased, bone, apposition, bone, formation, or, decreased, bone, resorption, but, garn, noted, the, stenosis, is, quite, similar, to, the, congenital, condition, in, modern, humans, induced, by, hyper, apposition, in, 1985, biological, anthropologist, gail, kennedy, argued, for, resorption, as, a, result, of, hyperparathyroidism, caused, by, hypocalcemia, calcium, deficiency, a, consequence, of, a, dietary, shift, to, low, calcium, meat, kennedy, could, not, explain, why, the, calcium, metabolism, of, h, erectus, never, adjusted, in, 1985, american, paleoanthropologist, mary, doria, russell, and, colleagues, argued, the, supraorbital, torus, is, a, response, to, withstanding, major, bending, moment, which, localizes, in, that, region, when, significant, force, is, applied, through, the, front, teeth, such, as, while, using, the, mouth, as, a, third, hand, to, carry, objects, in, 2004, noel, boaz, and, russel, ciochon, suggested, it, was, a, result, of, a, cultural, practice, wherein, h, erectus, would, fight, each, other, with, fists, stones, or, clubs, to, settle, disputes, or, battle, for, mates, since, the, skull, is, reinforced, in, key, areas, the, mandible, is, quite, robust, capable, of, absorbing, heavy, blows, no, glass, jaw, the, heavy, brow, ridge, protects, the, eyes, and, transitions, into, a, bar, covering, the, ears, connecting, all, the, way, in, the, back, of, the, skull, meaning, blows, to, any, of, these, regions, can, be, effectively, dissipated, across, the, skull, and, the, sagittal, keel, protects, the, top, of, the, braincase, many, skullcaps, bear, usually, debilitating, fractures, such, as, the, peking, man, skull, x, yet, they, can, show, signs, of, surviving, and, healing, anthropologist, peter, brown, suggested, a, similar, reason, for, the, unusual, thickening, of, the, modern, australian, aboriginal, skull, a, result, of, a, ritual, popular, in, central, and, southeast, australian, tribes, where, adversaries, would, wack, each, other, with, waddies, sticks, until, knockout, the, only, fossil, evidence, regarding, h, erectus, group, composition, comes, from, 4, sites, outside, of, ileret, kenya, where, 97, footprints, made, 1, 5, mya, were, likely, left, by, a, group, of, at, least, 20, individuals, one, of, these, trackways, based, on, the, size, of, the, footprints, may, have, been, an, entirely, male, group, which, could, indicate, they, were, some, specialised, task, group, such, as, a, hunting, or, foraging, party, or, a, border, patrol, if, correct, this, would, also, indicate, sexual, division, of, labour, which, distinguishes, human, societies, from, those, of, other, great, apes, and, social, mammalian, carnivores, in, modern, hunter, gatherer, societies, who, target, large, prey, items, typically, male, parties, are, dispatched, to, bring, down, these, high, risk, animals, and, due, to, the, low, success, rate, female, parties, focus, on, more, predictable, foods, based, on, modern, day, savanna, chimp, and, baboon, group, composition, and, behavior, h, erectus, ergaster, may, have, lived, in, large, multi, male, groups, in, order, to, defend, against, large, savanna, predators, in, the, open, and, exposed, environment, however, dispersal, patterns, indicate, that, h, erectus, generally, avoided, areas, with, high, carnivore, density, it, is, possible, that, male, male, bonding, and, male, female, friendships, were, important, societal, aspects, because, h, erectus, children, had, faster, brain, growth, rates, h, erectus, likely, did, not, exhibit, the, same, degree, of, maternal, investment, or, child, rearing, behaviours, as, modern, humans, because, h, erectus, males, and, females, are, thought, to, have, been, about, the, same, size, compared, to, other, great, apes, exhibit, less, size, specific, sexual, dimorphism, it, is, generally, hypothesised, that, they, lived, in, a, monogamous, society, as, reduced, sexual, dimorphism, in, primates, is, typically, correlated, with, this, mating, system, however, it, is, unclear, if, h, erectus, did, in, fact, exhibit, humanlike, rates, of, sexual, dimorphism, if, they, did, then, it, would, mean, only, female, height, increased, from, the, ancestor, species, which, could, have, been, caused, by, a, shift, in, female, fertility, or, diet, and, or, reduced, pressure, on, males, for, large, size, this, in, turn, could, imply, a, shift, in, female, behavior, which, made, it, difficult, for, males, to, maintain, a, harem, and, vice, versa, increasing, brain, size, is, often, directly, associated, with, a, meatier, diet, and, resultant, higher, caloric, intake, human, entomophagy, and, therefore, an, increase, in, protein, consumption, through, insects, has, also, been, proposed, as, a, possible, cause, however, it, is, also, possible, that, the, energy, expensive, guts, decreased, in, size, in, h, erectus, because, the, large, ape, gut, is, used, to, synthesize, fat, by, fermenting, plant, matter, which, was, replaced, by, dietary, animal, fat, allowing, more, energy, to, be, diverted, to, brain, growth, this, would, have, increased, brain, size, indirectly, while, maintaining, the, same, caloric, requirements, of, ancestor, species, h, erectus, may, have, also, been, the, first, to, use, a, hunting, and, gathering, food, collecting, strategy, as, a, response, to, the, increasing, dependence, on, meat, with, an, emphasis, on, teamwork, division, of, labor, and, food, sharing, hunting, and, gathering, was, a, dramatically, different, subsistence, strategy, from, previous, modes, h, erectus, sites, frequently, are, associated, with, assemblages, of, medium, to, large, sized, game, namely, elephants, rhinos, hippos, bovine, and, boar, h, erectus, would, have, had, considerable, leftovers, potentially, pointing, to, food, sharing, or, long, term, food, preservation, such, as, by, drying, if, most, of, the, kill, was, indeed, utilized, it, is, possible, that, h, erectus, grew, to, become, quite, dependent, on, large, animal, meat, and, the, disappearance, of, h, erectus, from, the, levant, is, correlated, with, the, local, extinction, of, the, straight, tusked, elephant, nonetheless, h, erectus, diet, likely, varied, widely, depending, upon, location, for, example, at, the, 780, kya, gesher, benot, ya, aqov, site, israel, the, inhabitants, gathered, and, ate, 55, different, types, of, fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, and, tubers, and, it, appears, that, they, used, fire, to, roast, certain, plant, materials, that, otherwise, would, have, been, inedible, they, also, consumed, amphibians, reptiles, birds, aquatic, and, terrestrial, invertebrates, in, addition, to, the, usual, large, creatures, such, as, elephant, and, fallow, deer, at, the, 1, 95, mya, fwjj20, lakeside, site, in, the, east, turkana, basin, kenya, the, inhabitants, ate, alongside, the, usual, bovids, hippos, and, rhinos, aquatic, creatures, such, as, turtles, crocodiles, and, catfish, the, large, animals, were, likely, scavenged, at, this, site, but, the, turtles, and, fish, were, possibly, collected, live, in, east, africa, between, 2, 0, and, 1, 4, mya, carcasses, of, c, 4, grazing, ungulates, particularly, alcelaphins, featured, increasingly, prominently, in, the, diet, of, these, hominins, at, the, 1, 5, mya, trinil, h, k, site, java, h, erectus, likely, gathered, fish, and, shellfish, dentally, h, erectus, mouths, were, not, as, versatile, as, those, of, ancestor, species, capable, of, processing, a, narrower, range, of, foods, however, tools, were, likely, used, to, process, hard, foods, thus, affecting, the, chewing, apparatus, and, this, combination, may, have, instead, increased, dietary, flexibility, though, this, does, not, equate, to, a, highly, varied, diet, such, versatility, may, have, permitted, h, erectus, to, inhabit, a, range, of, different, environments, and, migrate, beyond, africa, in, 1999, british, anthropologist, richard, wrangham, proposed, the, cooking, hypothesis, which, states, that, h, erectus, speciated, from, the, ancestral, h, habilis, because, of, fire, usage, and, cooking, 2, million, years, ago, to, explain, the, rapid, doubling, of, brain, size, between, these, two, species, in, only, a, 500, 000, year, timespan, and, the, sudden, appearance, of, the, typical, human, body, plan, cooking, makes, protein, more, easily, digestible, speeds, up, nutrient, absorption, and, destroys, food, borne, pathogens, which, would, have, increased, the, environment, s, natural, carrying, capacity, allowing, group, size, to, expand, causing, selective, pressure, for, sociality, requiring, greater, brain, function, however, the, fossil, record, does, not, associate, the, emergence, of, h, erectus, with, fire, usage, nor, with, any, technological, breakthrough, for, that, matter, and, cooking, likely, did, not, become, a, common, practice, until, after, 400, kya, java, man, s, dispersal, through, southeast, asia, coincides, with, the, extirpation, of, the, giant, turtle, megalochelys, possibly, due, to, overhunting, as, the, turtle, would, have, been, an, easy, slow, moving, target, which, could, have, been, stored, for, quite, some, time, h, erectus, is, credited, with, inventing, the, acheulean, stone, tool, industry, succeeding, the, oldowan, industry, and, were, the, first, to, make, lithic, flakes, bigger, than, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, and, hand, axes, which, includes, bifacial, tools, with, only, 2, sides, such, as, picks, knives, and, cleavers, though, larger, and, heavier, these, hand, axes, had, sharper, chiseled, edges, they, were, likely, multi, purpose, tools, used, in, variety, of, activities, such, as, cutting, meat, wood, or, edible, plants, in, 1979, american, paleontologist, thomas, wynn, stated, that, acheulean, technology, required, operational, intelligence, foresight, and, planning, being, markedly, more, complex, than, oldowan, technology, which, included, lithics, of, unstandardized, shape, cross, sections, and, symmetry, based, on, this, he, concluded, that, there, is, not, a, significant, disparity, in, intelligence, between, h, erectus, and, modern, humans, and, that, for, the, last, 300, 000, years, increasing, intelligence, has, not, been, a, major, influencer, of, cultural, evolution, however, a, 1, year, old, h, erectus, specimen, shows, that, this, species, lacked, an, extended, childhood, required, for, greater, brain, development, indicating, lower, cognitive, capabilities, a, few, sites, likely, due, to, occupation, over, several, generations, features, hand, axes, en, masse, such, as, at, melka, kunture, ethiopia, olorgesailie, kenya, isimila, tanzania, and, kalambo, falls, zambia, the, earliest, record, of, acheulean, technology, comes, from, west, turkana, kenya, 1, 76, mya, oldowan, lithics, are, also, known, from, the, site, and, the, two, seemed, to, coexist, for, some, time, the, earliest, records, of, acheulean, technology, outside, of, africa, date, to, no, older, than, 1, mya, indicating, it, only, became, widespread, after, some, secondary, h, erectus, dispersal, from, africa, on, java, h, erectus, produced, tools, from, shells, at, sangiran, and, trinil, spherical, stones, measuring, 6, 12, cm, 2, 4, 4, 7, in, in, diameter, are, frequently, found, in, african, and, chinese, lower, paleolithic, sites, and, were, potentially, used, as, bolas, if, correct, this, would, indicate, string, and, cordage, technology, h, erectus, is, credited, as, the, first, human, ancestor, to, have, used, fire, though, the, timing, of, this, invention, is, debated, mainly, because, campfires, very, rarely, and, very, poorly, preserve, over, long, periods, of, time, let, alone, thousands, or, millions, of, years, the, earliest, claimed, fire, sites, are, in, kenya, fxjj20, at, koobi, fora, and, gnji, 1, 6e, in, the, chemoigut, formation, as, far, back, as, 1, 5, mya, and, in, south, africa, wonderwerk, cave, 1, 7, mya, the, first, firekeepers, are, thought, to, have, simply, transported, to, caves, and, maintained, naturally, occurring, fires, for, extended, periods, of, time, or, only, sporadically, when, the, opportunity, arose, maintaining, fires, would, require, firekeepers, to, have, knowledge, on, slow, burning, materials, such, as, dung, fire, becomes, markedly, more, abundant, in, the, wider, archaeological, record, after, 400, 000, 300, 000, years, ago, which, can, be, explained, as, some, advancement, in, fire, management, techniques, took, place, at, this, time, or, human, ancestors, only, opportunistically, used, fire, until, this, time, it, is, possible, that, firestarting, was, invented, and, lost, and, reinvented, multiple, times, and, independently, by, different, communities, rather, than, being, invented, in, one, place, and, spreading, throughout, the, world, the, earliest, evidence, of, hearths, comes, from, gesher, benot, ya, aqov, israel, over, 700, 000, years, ago, where, fire, is, recorded, in, multiple, layers, in, an, area, close, to, water, both, uncharacteristic, of, natural, fires, artificial, lighting, may, have, led, to, increased, waking, hours, modern, humans, have, about, a, 16, hour, waking, period, whereas, other, apes, are, generally, awake, from, only, sunup, to, sundown, and, these, additional, hours, were, probably, used, for, socializing, because, of, this, fire, usage, is, probably, also, linked, to, the, origin, of, language, artificial, lighting, may, have, also, made, sleeping, on, the, ground, instead, of, the, trees, possible, by, keeping, terrestrial, predators, at, bay, migration, into, the, frigid, climate, of, ice, age, europe, may, have, only, been, possible, because, of, fire, but, evidence, of, fire, usage, in, europe, until, about, 400, 300, 000, years, ago, is, notably, absent, if, these, early, european, h, erectus, did, not, have, fire, it, is, largely, unclear, how, they, stayed, warm, avoided, predators, and, prepared, animal, fat, and, meat, for, consumption, there, was, also, a, lower, likelihood, of, naturally, occurring, fires, due, to, lightning, being, less, common, in, areas, further, north, it, is, possible, that, they, only, knew, how, to, maintain, fires, in, certain, settings, in, the, landscapes, and, prepared, food, some, distance, away, from, home, meaning, evidence, of, fire, and, evidence, of, hominin, activity, are, spaced, far, apart, alternatively, h, erectus, may, have, only, pushed, farther, north, during, warmer, interglacial, periods, thus, not, requiring, fire, food, storage, or, clothing, technology, and, their, dispersal, patterns, indicate, they, generally, stayed, in, warmer, lower, to, middle, latitudes, it, is, debated, if, the, h, e, pekinensis, inhabitants, of, zhoukoudian, northern, china, were, capable, of, controlling, fires, as, early, as, 770, kya, to, stay, warm, in, what, may, have, been, a, relatively, cold, climate, in, 1962, a, 366, cm, 427, cm, 30, cm, 12, ft, 14, ft, 1, ft, circle, made, with, volcanic, rocks, was, discovered, in, olduvai, gorge, at, 61, 76, cm, 2, 2, 5, ft, intervals, rocks, were, piled, up, to, 15, 23, cm, 6, 9, in, high, british, palaeoanthropologist, mary, leakey, suggested, the, rock, piles, were, used, to, support, poles, stuck, into, the, ground, possibly, to, support, a, windbreak, or, a, rough, hut, some, modern, day, nomadic, tribes, build, similar, low, lying, rock, walls, to, build, temporary, shelters, upon, bending, upright, branches, as, poles, and, using, grasses, or, animal, hide, as, a, screen, dating, to, 1, 75, mya, it, is, the, oldest, claimed, evidence, of, architecture, in, europe, evidence, of, constructed, dwelling, structures, dating, to, or, following, the, holstein, interglacial, which, began, 424, kya, has, been, claimed, in, bilzingsleben, germany, terra, amata, france, and, fermanville, and, saint, germain, des, vaux, in, normandy, the, oldest, evidence, of, a, dwelling, and, a, campfire, in, europe, comes, from, p, ezletice, czech, republic, 700, kya, during, the, cromerian, interglacial, this, dwelling, s, base, measured, about, 3, m, 4, m, 9, 8, ft, 13, 1, ft, on, the, exterior, and, 3, m, 2, m, 9, 8, ft, 6, 6, ft, on, the, interior, and, is, considered, to, have, been, a, firm, surface, hut, probably, with, a, vaulted, roof, made, of, thick, branches, or, thin, poles, supported, by, a, foundation, of, big, rocks, and, earth, and, likely, functioned, as, a, winter, base, camp, the, earliest, evidence, of, cave, habitation, is, wonderwerk, cave, south, africa, about, 1, 6, mya, but, evidence, of, cave, use, globally, is, sporadic, until, about, 600, kya, it, is, largely, unclear, when, clothing, was, invented, with, the, earliest, estimate, stretching, as, far, back, as, 3, mya, to, compensate, for, a, lack, of, insulating, body, hair, it, is, known, that, head, lice, and, body, lice, the, latter, can, only, inhabit, clothed, individuals, for, modern, humans, diverged, about, 170, kya, well, before, modern, humans, left, africa, meaning, clothes, were, already, well, in, use, before, encountering, cold, climates, one, of, the, first, uses, of, animal, hide, is, thought, to, have, been, for, clothing, and, the, oldest, hide, scrapers, date, to, about, 780, kya, though, this, is, not, indicative, of, clothing, acheulean, artifacts, discovered, on, isolated, islands, that, were, never, connected, to, land, in, the, pleistocene, may, show, seafaring, by, h, erectus, as, early, as, 1, mya, in, indonesia, they, had, arrived, on, the, islands, of, flores, timor, and, roti, which, would, have, necessitated, crossing, the, lombok, strait, the, wallace, line, at, least, before, 800, kya, it, is, also, possible, they, were, the, first, european, mariners, as, well, and, crossed, the, strait, of, gibraltar, between, north, africa, and, spain, a, 2021, genetic, analysis, of, these, island, populations, of, h, erectus, found, no, evidence, of, interbreeding, with, modern, humans, seafaring, capability, would, show, h, erectus, had, a, great, capacity, for, planning, likely, months, in, advance, of, the, trip, however, there, is, no, evidence, of, the, watercrafts, required, for, such, seafaring, though, these, would, likely, not, survive, in, the, fossil, record, additionally, experiments, by, bednarik, that, show, modern, humans, can, make, complex, boats, using, materials, available, to, h, erectus, actually, undercut, this, hypothesis, such, experiments, presuppose, cognition, rivalling, h, sapiens, despite, the, lack, of, evidence, for, such, a, premise, instead, it, may, well, be, that, homo, erectus, reached, flores, through, natural, rafts, namely, immense, chunks, of, land, uprooted, by, natural, disasters, similarly, homo, luzonensis, is, dated, between, 771, 000, and, 631, 000, years, ago, because, luzon, has, always, been, an, island, in, the, quaternary, the, ancestors, of, h, luzonensis, would, have, had, to, have, made, a, substantial, sea, crossing, and, crossed, the, huxley, line, oldowan, artifacts, discovered, on, the, isolated, island, of, socotra, may, show, seafaring, for, h, erectus, as, early, as, 1, 4, 2, 5, mya, as, with, many, isolated, island, systems, bats, are, the, only, mammals, native, to, socotra, the, socotran, pipistrelle, hypsugo, lanzai, is, the, only, species, of, bat, and, mammal, in, general, thought, to, be, endemic, to, the, island, the, earliest, probable, example, of, infirming, sick, group, members, is, a, 1, 77, mya, h, e, georgicus, specimen, who, had, lost, all, but, one, tooth, due, to, age, or, gum, disease, the, earliest, example, of, severe, chewing, impairment, yet, still, survived, for, several, years, afterwards, however, it, is, possible, australopithecines, were, capable, of, caring, for, debilitated, group, members, unable, to, chew, this, h, e, georgicus, individual, probably, ate, soft, plant, or, animal, foods, possibly, with, assistance, from, other, group, members, high, latitude, groups, are, thought, to, have, been, predominantly, carnivorous, eating, soft, tissue, such, as, bone, marrow, or, brains, which, may, have, increased, survival, rates, for, toothless, individuals, the, 1, 5, mya, turkana, boy, was, diagnosed, with, juvenile, spinal, disc, herniation, and, because, this, specimen, was, still, growing, this, caused, some, scoliosis, abnormal, curving, of, the, spine, these, usually, cause, recurrent, lower, back, pain, and, sciatica, pain, running, down, the, leg, and, likely, restricted, turkana, boy, in, walking, bending, and, other, daily, activities, the, specimen, appears, to, have, survived, into, adolescence, which, evidences, advanced, group, care, the, 1, 000, 700, kya, java, man, specimen, presents, a, noticeable, osteocyte, on, the, femur, likely, paget, s, disease, of, bone, and, osteopetrosis, thickening, of, the, bone, likely, resulting, from, skeletal, fluorosis, caused, by, ingestion, of, food, contaminated, by, fluorine, filled, volcanic, ash, as, the, specimen, was, found, in, ash, filled, strata, livestock, that, grazes, on, volcanic, ash, ridden, fields, typically, die, of, acute, intoxication, within, a, few, days, or, weeks, an, engraved, pseudodon, shell, dub1006, fl, with, geometric, markings, could, possibly, be, evidence, of, the, earliest, art, making, dating, back, to, 546, 436, kya, art, making, capabilities, could, be, considered, evidence, of, symbolic, thinking, which, is, associated, with, modern, cognition, and, behavior, in, 1976, american, archeologist, alexander, marshack, asserted, that, engraved, lines, on, an, ox, rib, associated, with, acheulean, lithics, from, pech, de, l, az, france, are, similar, to, a, meander, design, found, in, modern, human, upper, paleolithic, cave, art, three, ostrich, eggshell, beads, associated, with, achuelian, lithics, were, found, in, northwestern, africa, the, earliest, disc, beads, ever, found, and, acheulian, disc, beads, have, also, been, found, in, france, and, israel, the, middle, pleistocene, venus, of, tan, tan, and, venus, of, berekhat, ram, are, postulated, to, been, crafted, by, h, erectus, to, resemble, a, human, form, they, were, mostly, formed, by, natural, weathering, but, slightly, modified, to, emphasize, certain, grooves, to, suggest, hairline, limbs, and, eyes, the, former, has, traces, of, pigments, on, the, front, side, possibly, indicating, it, was, colored, h, erectus, was, also, the, earliest, human, to, have, intentionally, collected, red, colored, pigments, namely, ochre, recorded, as, early, as, the, middle, pleistocene, ochre, lumps, at, olduvai, gorge, tanzania, associated, with, the, 1, 4, ma, olduvai, hominid, 9, and, ambrona, spain, which, dates, to, 424, 374, kya, were, suggested, to, have, been, struck, by, a, hammerstone, and, purposefully, shaped, and, trimmed, at, terra, amata, france, which, dates, to, 425, 400, or, 355, 325, kya, red, yellow, and, brown, ochres, were, recovered, in, association, with, pole, structures, ochre, was, probably, heated, to, achieve, such, a, wide, color, range, as, it, is, unclear, if, h, erectus, could, have, used, ochre, for, any, practical, application, ochre, collection, might, indicate, that, h, erectus, was, the, earliest, human, to, have, exhibited, a, sense, of, aesthetics, and, to, think, beyond, simply, survival, later, human, species, are, postulated, to, have, used, ochre, as, body, paint, but, in, the, case, of, h, erectus, it, is, contested, if, body, paint, was, used, so, early, in, time, further, it, is, unclear, if, these, few, examples, are, not, simply, isolated, incidents, of, ochre, use, as, ochre, is, much, more, prevalent, in, middle, and, upper, paleolithic, sites, attributed, to, neanderthals, and, h, sapiens, in, 1935, jewish, german, anthropologist, franz, weidenreich, speculated, that, the, inhabitants, of, the, chinese, zhoukoudian, peking, man, site, were, members, of, some, lower, paleolithic, skull, cult, because, the, skulls, all, showed, fatal, blows, to, the, head, breaking, in, of, the, foramen, magnum, at, the, base, of, the, skull, by, and, large, lack, of, preserved, facial, aspects, an, apparently, consistent, pattern, of, breaking, on, the, mandible, and, a, lack, of, post, cranial, remains, elements, that, are, not, the, skull, he, believed, that, the, inhabitants, were, headhunters, and, smashed, open, the, skulls, and, ate, the, brains, of, their, victims, however, scavenging, animals, and, natural, forces, such, as, flooding, can, also, inflict, the, same, kind, of, damage, to, skulls, and, there, is, not, enough, evidence, to, suggest, manhunting, or, cannibalism, in, 1999, british, science, writers, marek, kohn, and, steven, mithen, said, that, many, hand, axes, exhibit, no, wear, and, were, produced, en, masse, and, concluded, that, these, symmetrical, tear, drop, shaped, lithics, functioned, primarily, as, display, tools, so, males, could, prove, their, fitness, to, females, in, some, courting, ritual, and, were, discarded, afterwards, however, an, apparent, lack, of, reported, wearing, is, likely, due, to, a, lack, of, use, wear, studies, and, only, a, few, sites, yield, an, exorbitant, sum, of, hand, axes, likely, due, to, gradual, accumulation, over, generations, instead, of, mass, production, in, 1984, the, vertebral, column, of, the, 1, 6, mya, adolescent, turkana, boy, indicated, that, this, individual, did, not, have, properly, developed, respiratory, muscles, in, order, to, produce, speech, in, 2001, american, anthropologists, bruce, latimer, and, james, ohman, concluded, that, turkana, boy, was, afflicted, by, skeletal, dysplasia, and, scoliosis, in, 2006, american, anthropologist, marc, meyer, and, colleagues, described, a, 1, 8, mya, h, e, georgicus, specimen, as, having, a, spine, within, the, range, of, variation, of, modern, human, spines, contending, that, turkana, boy, had, spinal, stenosis, and, was, thus, not, representative, of, the, species, also, because, he, considered, h, e, georgicus, ancestral, to, all, non, african, h, erectus, meyer, concluded, that, the, respiratory, muscles, of, all, h, erectus, at, least, non, h, ergaster, would, not, have, impeded, vocalisation, or, speech, production, however, in, 2013, and, 2014, anthropologist, regula, schiess, and, colleagues, concluded, that, there, is, no, evidence, of, any, congenital, defects, in, turkana, boy, and, considered, the, specimen, representative, of, the, species, neurologically, all, homo, have, similarly, configured, brains, and, likewise, the, broca, s, and, wernicke, s, areas, in, charge, of, sentence, formulation, and, speech, production, in, modern, humans, of, h, erectus, were, comparable, to, those, of, modern, humans, however, this, is, not, indicative, of, anything, in, terms, of, speech, capability, as, even, large, chimpanzees, can, have, similarly, expanded, broca, s, area, and, it, is, unclear, if, these, areas, served, as, language, centers, in, archaic, humans, a, 1, year, old, h, erectus, specimen, shows, that, an, extended, childhood, to, allow, for, brain, growth, which, is, a, prerequisite, in, language, acquisition, was, not, exhibited, in, this, species, the, hyoid, bone, supports, the, tongue, and, makes, possible, modulation, of, the, vocal, tract, to, control, pitch, and, volume, a, 400, kya, h, erectus, hyoid, bone, from, castel, di, guido, italy, is, bar, shaped, more, similar, to, that, of, other, homo, than, to, that, of, non, human, apes, and, australopithecus, but, is, devoid, of, muscle, impressions, has, a, shield, shaped, body, and, is, implied, to, have, had, reduced, greater, horns, meaning, h, erectus, lacked, a, humanlike, vocal, apparatus, and, thus, anatomical, prerequisites, for, a, modern, human, level, of, speech, increasing, brain, size, and, cultural, complexity, in, tandem, with, technological, refinement, and, the, hypothesis, that, articulate, neanderthals, and, modern, humans, may, have, inherited, speech, capabilities, from, the, last, common, ancestor, could, possibly, indicate, that, h, erectus, used, some, proto, language, and, built, the, basic, framework, which, fully, fledged, languages, would, eventually, be, built, around, however, this, ancestor, may, have, instead, been, h, heidelbergensis, as, a, hyoid, bone, of, a, 530, kya, h, heidelbergensis, specimen, from, the, spanish, sima, de, los, huesos, cave, is, like, that, of, modern, humans, and, another, specimen, from, the, same, area, shows, an, auditory, capacity, sensitive, enough, to, pick, up, human, speech, the, last, known, occurrence, of, homo, erectus, is, 117, 000, 108, 000, years, ago, in, ngandong, java, according, to, a, study, published, in, 2019, in, 2020, researchers, reported, that, homo, erectus, and, homo, heidelbergensis, lost, more, than, half, of, their, climate, niche, climate, they, were, adapted, to, with, no, corresponding, reduction, in, physical, range, just, before, extinction, and, that, climate, change, played, a, substantial, role, in, extinctions, of, past, homo, species, the, lower, cave, of, china, s, zhoukoudian, cave, is, one, of, the, most, important, archaeological, sites, worldwide, there, have, been, remains, of, 45, homo, erectus, individuals, found, and, thousands, of, tools, recovered, most, of, these, remains, were, lost, during, world, war, 2, with, the, exception, of, two, postcranial, elements, that, were, rediscovered, in, china, in, 1951, and, four, human, teeth, from, dragon, bone, hill, new, evidence, has, shown, that, homo, erectus, does, not, have, uniquely, thick, vault, bones, as, was, previously, thought, testing, showed, that, neither, asian, nor, african, homo, erectus, had, uniquely, large, vault, bones, some, of, the, major, homo, erectus, fossils, a, cladogram,
