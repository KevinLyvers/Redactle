the, dog, canis, familiaris, or, canis, lupus, familiaris, is, a, domesticated, descendant, of, the, wolf, also, called, the, domestic, dog, it, was, domesticated, from, an, extinct, population, of, wolves, during, the, late, pleistocene, over, 14, 000, years, ago, by, hunter, gatherers, prior, to, the, development, of, agriculture, the, dog, was, the, first, species, to, be, domesticated, by, humans, experts, estimate, that, due, to, their, long, association, with, humans, dogs, have, expanded, to, a, large, number, of, domestic, individuals, and, gained, the, ability, to, thrive, on, a, starch, rich, diet, that, would, be, inadequate, for, other, canids, the, dog, has, been, selectively, bred, over, millennia, for, various, behaviors, sensory, capabilities, and, physical, attributes, dog, breeds, vary, widely, in, shape, size, and, color, they, perform, many, roles, for, humans, such, as, hunting, herding, pulling, loads, protection, assisting, police, and, the, military, companionship, therapy, and, aiding, disabled, people, over, the, millennia, dogs, became, uniquely, adapted, to, human, behavior, and, the, human, canine, bond, has, been, a, topic, of, frequent, study, this, influence, on, human, society, has, given, them, the, sobriquet, of, man, s, best, friend, gray, wolf, domestic, dog, coyote, african, wolf, ethiopian, wolf, golden, jackal, dhole, african, wild, dog, side, striped, jackal, black, backed, jackal, in, 1758, the, swedish, botanist, and, zoologist, carl, linnaeus, published, in, his, systema, naturae, the, two, word, naming, of, species, binomial, nomenclature, canis, is, the, latin, word, meaning, dog, and, under, this, genus, he, listed, the, domestic, dog, the, wolf, and, the, golden, jackal, he, classified, the, domestic, dog, as, canis, familiaris, and, on, the, next, page, classified, the, grey, wolf, as, canis, lupus, linnaeus, considered, the, dog, to, be, a, separate, species, from, the, wolf, because, of, its, upturning, tail, cauda, recurvata, in, latin, term, which, is, not, found, in, any, other, canid, in, 1999, a, study, of, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, indicated, that, the, domestic, dog, may, have, originated, from, the, grey, wolf, with, the, dingo, and, new, guinea, singing, dog, breeds, having, developed, at, a, time, when, human, communities, were, more, isolated, from, each, other, in, the, third, edition, of, mammal, species, of, the, world, published, in, 2005, the, mammalogist, w, christopher, wozencraft, listed, under, the, wolf, canis, lupus, its, wild, subspecies, and, proposed, two, additional, subspecies, which, formed, the, domestic, dog, clade, familiaris, as, named, by, linnaeus, in, 1758, and, dingo, named, by, meyer, in, 1793, wozencraft, included, hallstromi, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, as, another, name, junior, synonym, for, the, dingo, wozencraft, referred, to, the, mtdna, study, as, one, of, the, guides, informing, his, decision, mammalogists, have, noted, the, inclusion, of, familiaris, and, dingo, together, under, the, domestic, dog, clade, with, some, debating, it, in, 2019, a, workshop, hosted, by, the, iucn, species, survival, commission, s, canid, specialist, group, considered, the, dingo, and, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, to, be, feral, canis, familiaris, and, therefore, did, not, assess, them, for, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, the, earliest, remains, generally, accepted, to, be, those, of, a, domesticated, dog, were, discovered, in, bonn, oberkassel, germany, contextual, isotopic, genetic, and, morphological, evidence, shows, that, this, dog, was, not, a, local, wolf, the, dog, was, dated, to, 14, 223, years, ago, and, was, found, buried, along, with, a, man, and, a, woman, all, three, having, been, sprayed, with, red, hematite, powder, and, buried, under, large, thick, basalt, blocks, the, dog, had, died, of, canine, distemper, earlier, remains, dating, back, to, 30, 000, years, ago, have, been, described, as, paleolithic, dogs, but, their, status, as, dogs, or, wolves, remains, debated, because, considerable, morphological, diversity, existed, among, wolves, during, the, late, pleistocene, this, timing, indicates, that, the, dog, was, the, first, species, to, be, domesticated, in, the, time, of, hunter, gatherers, which, predates, agriculture, dna, sequences, show, that, all, ancient, and, modern, dogs, share, a, common, ancestry, and, descended, from, an, ancient, extinct, wolf, population, that, was, distinct, from, any, modern, wolf, lineage, some, studies, have, posited, that, all, living, wolves, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, dogs, while, others, have, suggested, that, dogs, are, more, closely, related, to, modern, eurasian, wolves, than, to, american, wolves, the, dog, is, a, classic, example, of, a, domestic, animal, that, likely, travelled, a, commensal, pathway, into, domestication, the, questions, of, when, and, where, dogs, were, first, domesticated, have, taxed, geneticists, and, archaeologists, for, decades, genetic, studies, suggest, a, domestication, process, commencing, over, 25, 000, years, ago, in, one, or, several, wolf, populations, in, either, europe, the, high, arctic, or, eastern, asia, in, 2021, a, literature, review, of, the, current, evidence, infers, that, the, dog, was, domesticated, in, siberia, 23, 000, years, ago, by, ancient, north, siberians, then, later, dispersed, eastward, into, the, americas, and, westward, across, eurasia, with, dogs, likely, accompanying, the, first, humans, to, inhabit, the, americas, some, studies, have, suggested, that, the, extinct, japanese, wolf, is, closely, related, to, the, ancestor, of, domestic, dogs, dogs, are, the, most, variable, mammal, on, earth, with, around, 450, globally, recognized, dog, breeds, in, the, victorian, era, directed, human, selection, developed, the, modern, dog, breeds, which, resulted, in, a, vast, range, of, phenotypes, most, breeds, were, derived, from, small, numbers, of, founders, within, the, last, 200, years, since, then, dogs, have, undergone, rapid, phenotypic, change, and, have, been, subjected, to, artificial, selection, by, humans, the, skull, body, and, limb, proportions, between, breeds, display, more, phenotypic, diversity, than, can, be, found, within, the, entire, order, of, carnivores, these, breeds, possess, distinct, traits, related, to, morphology, which, include, body, size, skull, shape, tail, phenotype, fur, type, and, colour, their, behavioural, traits, include, guarding, herding, hunting, retrieving, and, scent, detection, their, personality, traits, include, hypersocial, behavior, boldness, and, aggression, present, day, dogs, are, dispersed, around, the, world, an, example, of, this, dispersal, is, the, numerous, modern, breeds, of, european, lineage, during, the, victorian, era, dogs, are, extremely, variable, in, size, ranging, from, one, of, the, largest, breeds, the, great, dane, at, 50, to, 79, kg, 110, to, 174, lb, and, 71, to, 81, cm, 28, to, 32, in, to, one, of, the, smallest, the, chihuahua, at, 0, 5, to, 3, kg, 1, 1, to, 6, 6, lb, and, 13, to, 20, cm, 5, 1, to, 7, 9, in, all, healthy, dogs, regardless, of, their, size, and, type, have, an, identical, skeletal, structure, with, the, exception, of, the, number, of, bones, in, the, tail, although, there, is, significant, skeletal, variation, between, dogs, of, different, types, the, dog, s, skeleton, is, well, adapted, for, running, the, vertebrae, on, the, neck, and, back, have, extensions, for, back, muscles, consisting, of, epaxial, muscles, and, hypaxial, muscles, to, connect, to, the, long, ribs, provide, room, for, the, heart, and, lungs, and, the, shoulders, are, unattached, to, the, skeleton, allowing, for, flexibility, compared, to, the, dog, s, wolf, like, ancestors, selective, breeding, since, domestication, has, seen, the, dog, s, skeleton, larger, in, size, for, larger, types, such, as, mastiffs, and, miniaturised, for, smaller, types, such, as, terriers, dwarfism, has, been, selectively, used, for, some, types, where, short, legs, are, advantageous, such, as, dachshunds, and, corgis, most, dogs, naturally, have, 26, vertebrae, in, their, tails, but, some, with, naturally, short, tails, have, as, few, as, three, the, dog, s, skull, has, identical, components, regardless, of, breed, type, but, there, is, significant, divergence, in, terms, of, skull, shape, between, types, the, three, basic, skull, shapes, are, the, elongated, dolichocephalic, type, as, seen, in, sighthounds, the, intermediate, mesocephalic, or, mesaticephalic, type, and, the, very, short, and, broad, brachycephalic, type, exemplified, by, mastiff, type, skulls, the, jaw, contains, around, 42, teeth, and, is, designed, for, the, consumption, of, flesh, dogs, use, their, carnassial, teeth, to, cut, food, into, bite, sized, chunks, more, especially, meat, dogs, senses, include, vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and, magnetoreception, one, study, suggests, that, dogs, can, feel, small, variations, in, earth, s, magnetic, field, dogs, prefer, to, defecate, with, their, spines, aligned, in, a, north, south, position, in, calm, magnetic, field, conditions, dogs, vision, is, dichromatic, the, dog, s, visual, world, consists, of, yellows, blues, and, grays, they, have, difficulty, differentiating, between, red, and, green, the, divergence, of, the, eye, axis, of, dogs, ranges, from, 12, 25, depending, on, the, breed, dogs, eyes, of, different, breeds, can, have, different, retina, configurations, the, fovea, centralis, area, of, dogs, eyes, which, is, attached, to, a, nerve, fiber, is, the, most, sensitive, to, photons, while, the, human, brain, is, dominated, by, a, large, visual, cortex, the, dog, brain, is, dominated, by, a, large, olfactory, cortex, dogs, have, roughly, forty, times, more, smell, sensitive, receptors, than, humans, ranging, from, about, 125, million, to, nearly, 300, million, in, some, dog, breeds, such, as, bloodhounds, this, sense, of, smell, is, the, most, prominent, sense, of, the, species, it, detects, chemical, changes, in, the, environment, allowing, dogs, to, pinpoint, the, location, of, mating, partners, potential, stressors, resources, etc, dogs, also, have, an, acute, sense, of, hearing, up, to, 4, times, greater, than, that, of, humans, they, can, pick, up, the, slightest, sounds, from, about, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, compared, to, 90, m, 300, ft, for, humans, dogs, have, specialized, whiskers, known, as, vibrissae, sensing, organs, present, above, the, dog, s, eyes, below, their, jaw, and, on, their, muzzle, vibrissae, are, more, rigid, embedded, much, more, deeply, in, the, skin, than, other, hairs, and, have, a, greater, number, of, receptor, cells, at, their, base, they, can, detect, air, currents, subtle, vibrations, and, objects, in, the, dark, they, provide, an, early, warning, system, for, objects, that, might, strike, the, face, or, eyes, and, probably, help, direct, food, and, objects, towards, the, mouth, the, coats, of, domestic, dogs, are, of, two, varieties, double, being, familiar, with, dogs, as, well, as, wolves, originating, from, colder, climates, made, up, of, a, coarse, guard, hair, and, a, soft, down, hair, or, single, with, the, topcoat, only, breeds, may, have, an, occasional, blaze, stripe, or, star, of, white, fur, on, their, chest, or, underside, premature, graying, can, occur, in, dogs, as, early, as, one, year, of, age, this, is, associated, with, impulsive, behaviors, anxiety, behaviors, and, fear, of, unfamiliar, noise, people, or, animals, some, dog, breeds, are, hairless, while, others, have, a, very, thick, corded, coat, the, coats, of, certain, breeds, are, often, groomed, to, a, characteristic, style, for, example, the, yorkshire, terrier, s, show, cut, a, dog, s, dewclaw, is, the, five, digits, in, its, forelimb, and, hind, legs, dewclaws, on, the, forelimbs, are, attached, by, bone, and, ligament, while, the, dewclaws, on, the, hind, legs, are, attached, only, by, skin, most, dogs, aren, t, born, with, dewclaws, in, their, hind, legs, and, some, are, without, them, in, their, forelimbs, dogs, dewclaws, consist, of, the, proximal, phalanges, and, distal, phalanges, some, publications, thought, that, dewclaws, in, wolves, who, usually, do, not, have, dewclaws, were, a, sign, of, hybridization, with, dogs, a, dog, s, tail, is, the, terminal, appendage, of, the, vertebral, column, which, is, made, up, of, a, string, of, 5, to, 23, vertebrae, enclosed, in, muscles, and, skin, that, support, the, dog, s, back, extensor, muscles, one, of, the, primary, functions, of, a, dog, s, tail, is, to, communicate, their, emotional, state, the, tail, also, helps, the, dog, maintain, balance, by, putting, its, weight, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, dog, s, tilt, and, it, can, also, help, the, dog, spread, its, anal, gland, s, scent, through, the, tail, s, position, and, movement, dogs, can, have, a, violet, gland, or, supracaudal, gland, characterized, by, sebaceous, glands, on, the, dorsal, surface, of, their, tails, in, some, breeds, it, may, be, vestigial, or, absent, the, enlargement, of, the, violet, gland, in, the, tail, which, can, create, a, bald, spot, from, hair, loss, can, be, caused, by, cushing, s, disease, or, an, excess, of, sebum, from, androgens, in, the, sebaceous, glands, a, study, suggests, that, dogs, show, asymmetric, tail, wagging, responses, to, different, emotive, stimuli, stimuli, that, could, be, expected, to, elicit, approach, tendencies, seem, to, be, associated, with, higher, amplitude, of, tail, wagging, movements, to, the, right, side, dogs, can, injure, themselves, by, wagging, their, tails, forcefully, this, condition, is, called, kennel, tail, happy, tail, bleeding, tail, or, splitting, tail, in, some, hunting, dogs, the, tail, is, traditionally, docked, to, avoid, injuries, some, dogs, can, be, born, without, tails, because, of, a, dna, variant, in, the, t, gene, which, can, also, result, in, a, congenitally, short, bobtail, tail, tail, docking, is, opposed, by, many, veterinary, and, animal, welfare, organistions, such, as, the, american, veterinary, medical, association, and, the, british, veterinary, association, evidence, from, veterinary, practices, and, questionnaires, showed, that, around, 500, dogs, would, need, to, have, their, tail, docked, to, prevent, one, injury, some, breeds, of, dogs, are, prone, to, specific, genetic, ailments, such, as, elbow, and, hip, dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic, stenosis, a, cleft, palate, and, trick, knees, two, severe, medical, conditions, significantly, affecting, dogs, are, pyometra, affecting, unspayed, females, of, all, breeds, and, ages, and, gastric, dilatation, volvulus, bloat, which, affects, larger, breeds, or, deep, chested, dogs, both, of, these, are, acute, conditions, and, can, kill, rapidly, common, dog, parasites, are, lice, fleas, fly, larvae, ticks, mites, cestodes, nematodes, and, coccidia, taenia, is, a, notable, genius, with, 5, species, in, which, dogs, are, the, definitive, host, dogs, are, a, source, of, zoonoses, for, humans, rabies, is, a, notable, zoonosis, dogs, are, responsible, for, 99, of, rabies, cases, worldwide, however, in, some, developed, countries, such, as, the, uk, rabies, is, absent, from, dogs, and, is, instead, only, transmitted, by, bats, other, common, zoonoses, are, hydatid, disease, leptospirosis, pasteurellosis, ringworm, and, toxocariasis, common, infections, in, dogs, include, canine, adenovirus, canine, distemper, virus, canine, parvovirus, leptospirosis, canine, influenza, and, canine, coronavirus, all, of, these, conditions, have, vaccines, available, dogs, are, the, companion, animal, most, frequently, reported, for, exposure, to, toxins, most, poisonings, are, accidental, and, over, 80, of, reports, of, exposure, to, the, aspca, animal, poisoning, hotline, are, due, to, oral, exposure, the, most, common, substances, people, report, exposure, to, are, pharmaceuticals, toxic, foods, and, rodenticides, data, from, the, pet, poison, helpline, shows, that, human, drugs, are, the, most, frequent, cause, of, toxicosis, death, the, most, common, household, products, ingested, are, cleaning, products, most, food, related, poisonings, involved, theobromine, poisoning, chocolate, other, common, food, poisonings, include, xylitol, vitis, grapes, raisins, etc, and, allium, garlic, oninions, etc, pyrethrin, insecticides, were, the, most, common, cause, of, pesticide, poisoning, metaldehyde, a, common, pesticide, for, snails, and, slugs, typically, causes, severe, outcomes, when, ingested, by, dogs, neoplasia, is, the, most, common, cause, of, death, for, dogs, other, common, causes, of, death, are, heart, and, renal, failure, dogs, can, also, have, some, of, the, same, health, conditions, as, humans, including, diabetes, dental, and, heart, disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and, arthritis, type, 1, diabetes, mellitus, resembling, human, diabetes, is, the, type, of, diabetes, seen, most, often, in, dogs, their, pathology, is, similar, to, that, of, humans, as, is, their, response, to, treatment, and, their, outcomes, the, genes, involved, in, canine, obsessive, compulsive, disorders, led, to, the, detection, of, four, genes, in, humans, related, pathways, dogs, regulate, their, body, temperature, through, evaporation, of, saliva, and, lung, moisture, by, panting, dogs, are, a, source, of, zoonotic, infections, and, are, known, to, transmit, several, diseases, to, humans, by, infected, saliva, aerosols, feces, and, direct, contact, pets, including, dogs, can, catch, covid, 19, as, with, humans, infected, pets, may, exhibit, a, variety, of, symptoms, or, no, symptoms, at, all, the, typical, lifespan, of, dogs, varies, widely, among, breeds, but, the, median, longevity, the, age, at, which, half, the, dogs, in, a, population, have, died, and, half, are, still, alive, is, approximately, 12, 7, years, obesity, correlates, negatively, with, longevity, with, one, study, finding, obese, dogs, have, a, life, expectancy, approximately, a, year, and, a, half, less, than, dogs, with, a, healthy, weight, in, domestic, dogs, sexual, maturity, happens, around, six, months, to, one, year, for, both, males, and, females, although, this, can, be, delayed, until, up, to, two, years, of, age, for, some, large, breeds, this, is, the, time, at, which, female, dogs, will, have, their, first, estrous, cycle, characterized, by, their, vulvas, swelling, and, producing, discharges, usually, lasting, between, 4, and, 20, days, they, will, experience, subsequent, estrous, cycles, semiannually, during, which, the, body, prepares, for, pregnancy, at, the, peak, of, the, cycle, females, will, become, estrous, mentally, and, physically, receptive, to, copulation, because, the, ova, survive, and, can, be, fertilized, for, a, week, after, ovulation, more, than, one, male, can, sire, the, same, litter, fertilization, typically, occurs, two, to, five, days, after, ovulation, after, ejaculation, the, dogs, are, coitally, tied, for, around, 5, 30, minutes, because, of, the, male, s, bulbus, glandis, swelling, and, the, female, s, constrictor, vestibuli, contracting, the, male, will, continue, ejaculating, until, they, untie, naturally, due, to, muscle, relaxation, 14, 16, days, after, ovulation, the, embryo, attaches, to, the, uterus, and, after, seven, to, eight, more, days, a, heartbeat, is, detectable, dogs, bear, their, litters, roughly, 58, to, 68, days, after, fertilization, with, an, average, of, 63, days, although, the, length, of, gestation, can, vary, an, average, litter, consists, of, about, six, puppies, neutering, is, the, sterilization, of, animals, via, gonadectomy, which, is, an, orchidectomy, castration, in, dogs, and, ovariohysterectomy, spay, in, bitches, neutering, is, the, most, common, surgical, procedure, in, dogs, less, than, a, year, old, in, the, us, and, is, seen, as, a, control, method, for, overpopulation, neutering, often, occurs, as, early, as, 6, 14, weeks, in, shelters, in, the, us, the, american, society, for, the, prevention, of, cruelty, to, animals, aspca, advise, that, dogs, not, intended, for, further, breeding, should, be, neutered, so, that, they, do, not, have, undesired, puppies, that, may, later, be, euthanized, however, the, society, for, theriogenology, and, american, college, of, theriogenologists, take, a, different, view, a, joint, statement, opposes, mandatory, neutering, and, says, the, cause, of, overpopulation, in, the, us, is, cultural, neutering, is, less, common, in, most, european, countries, bar, the, uk, where, it, is, common, especially, nordic, countries, in, norway, neutering, is, illegal, unless, for, the, benefit, of, the, animal, s, health, e, g, ovariohysterectomy, in, case, of, ovarian, uterine, neoplasia, some, european, countries, have, similar, laws, to, norway, but, their, wording, either, explicitly, allows, for, neutering, for, controlling, reproduction, or, it, is, allowed, in, practice, or, by, contradiction, through, other, laws, a, few, such, as, italy, and, portugal, have, passed, recent, laws, that, promote, it, germany, forbids, early, age, neutering, but, neutering, is, still, allowed, at, the, usual, age, in, romania, neutering, is, mandatory, except, for, when, a, pedigree, to, select, breeds, can, be, shown, neutering, reduces, problems, caused, by, hypersexuality, especially, in, male, dogs, spayed, bitches, are, less, likely, to, develop, cancers, affecting, the, mammary, glands, ovaries, and, other, reproductive, organs, however, neutering, increases, the, risk, of, urinary, incontinence, in, bitches, prostate, cancer, in, dogs, and, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate, ligament, rupture, pyometra, obesity, and, diabetes, mellitus, in, either, sex, a, common, breeding, practice, for, pet, dogs, is, to, mate, them, between, close, relatives, e, g, between, half, and, full, siblings, inbreeding, depression, is, considered, to, be, due, mainly, to, the, expression, of, homozygous, deleterious, recessive, mutations, outcrossing, between, unrelated, individuals, including, dogs, of, different, breeds, results, in, the, beneficial, masking, of, deleterious, recessive, mutations, in, progeny, in, a, study, of, seven, dog, breeds, the, bernese, mountain, dog, basset, hound, cairn, terrier, brittany, german, shepherd, dog, leonberger, and, west, highland, white, terrier, it, was, found, that, inbreeding, decreases, litter, size, and, survival, another, analysis, of, data, on, 42, 855, dachshund, litters, found, that, as, the, inbreeding, coefficient, increased, litter, size, decreased, and, the, percentage, of, stillborn, puppies, increased, thus, indicating, inbreeding, depression, in, a, study, of, boxer, litters, 22, of, puppies, died, before, reaching, 7, weeks, of, age, stillbirth, was, the, most, frequent, cause, of, death, followed, by, infection, mortality, due, to, infection, increased, significantly, with, increases, in, inbreeding, dog, behavior, is, the, internally, coordinated, responses, actions, or, inactions, of, the, domestic, dog, individuals, or, groups, to, internal, and, external, stimuli, dogs, minds, have, been, shaped, by, millennia, of, contact, with, humans, they, have, acquired, the, ability, to, understand, and, communicate, with, humans, and, are, uniquely, attuned, to, human, behaviors, behavioral, scientists, thought, that, a, set, of, social, cognitive, abilities, in, domestic, dogs, that, are, not, possessed, by, the, dog, s, canine, relatives, or, other, highly, intelligent, mammals, such, as, great, apes, are, parallel, to, children, s, social, cognitive, skills, unlike, other, domestic, species, selected, for, production, related, traits, dogs, were, initially, selected, for, their, behaviors, in, 2016, a, study, found, that, only, 11, fixed, genes, showed, variation, between, wolves, and, dogs, these, gene, variations, were, unlikely, to, have, been, the, result, of, natural, evolution, and, indicate, selection, on, both, morphology, and, behavior, during, dog, domestication, these, genes, have, been, shown, to, affect, the, catecholamine, synthesis, pathway, with, the, majority, of, the, genes, affecting, the, fight, or, flight, response, i, e, selection, for, tameness, and, emotional, processing, dogs, generally, show, reduced, fear, and, aggression, compared, with, wolves, though, some, of, these, genes, have, been, associated, with, aggression, in, certain, dog, breeds, traits, of, high, sociability, and, lack, of, fear, in, dogs, may, include, genetic, modifications, related, to, williams, beuren, syndrome, in, humans, which, cause, hypersociability, at, the, expense, of, problem, solving, ability, in, a, 2023, study, of, 58, dogs, some, dogs, classified, as, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, like, showed, lower, serotonin, and, dopamine, concentrations, a, similar, study, claims, that, hyperactivity, is, more, common, in, male, and, young, dogs, a, dog, can, become, aggressive, because, of, trauma, or, abuse, fear, or, anxiety, territorial, protection, or, protecting, an, item, it, considers, valuable, acute, stress, reactions, from, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, seen, in, dogs, can, evolve, into, chronic, stress, police, dogs, with, ptsd, can, often, refuse, to, work, dogs, have, a, natural, instinct, called, prey, drive, the, term, is, chiefly, used, to, describe, training, dogs, habits, which, can, be, influenced, by, breeding, these, instincts, can, drive, dogs, to, consider, objects, or, other, animals, to, be, prey, or,

food, underground, one, study, found, that, wolves, outperformed, dogs, in, finding, food, caches, likely, due, to, a, difference, in, motivation, between, wolves, and, dogs, some, puppies, and, dogs, engage, in, coprophagy, out, of, habit, stress, for, attention, or, boredom, most, of, them, will, not, do, it, later, in, life, a, study, hypothesizes, that, the, behavior, was, inherited, from, wolves, a, behavior, likely, evolved, to, lessen, the, presence, of, intestinal, parasites, in, dens, most, dogs, can, swim, in, a, study, of, 412, dogs, around, 36, 5, of, the, dogs, could, not, swim, the, other, 63, 5, were, able, to, swim, without, a, trainer, in, a, swimming, pool, a, study, of, 55, dogs, found, a, correlation, between, swimming, and, improvement, of, the, hip,

stressed, or, in, pain, researchers, have, tested, dogs, ability, to, perceive, information, retain, it, as, knowledge, and, apply, it, to, solve, problems, studies, of, two, dogs, suggest, that, dogs, can, learn, by, inference, a, study, with, rico, a, border, collie, showed, that, he, knew, the, labels, of, over, 200, different, items, he, inferred, the, names, of, novel, things, by, exclusion, learning, and, correctly, retrieved, those, new, items, after, four, weeks, of, the, initial, exposure, a, study, of, another, border, collie, chaser, documented, that, he, had, learned, the, names, and, could, associate, them, by, verbal, command, with, over, 1, 000, words, one, study, of, canine, cognitive, abilities, found, that, dogs, capabilities, are, similar, to, those, of, horses, chimpanzees, or, cats, one, study, of, 18, household, dogs, found, that, the, dogs, could, not, distinguish, food, bowls, at, specific, locations, without, distinguishing, cues, the, study, stated, that, this, indicates, a, lack, of, spatial, memory, a, study, stated, that, dogs, have, a, visual, sense, for, number, the, dogs, showed, a, ratio, dependent, activation, both, for, numerical, values, from, 1, 3, to, larger, than, four, dogs, demonstrate, a, theory, of, mind, by, engaging, in, deception, another, experimental, study, showed, evidence, that, australian, dingos, can, outperform, domestic, dogs, in, non, social, problem, solving, indicating, that, domestic, dogs, may, have, lost, much, of, their, original, problem, solving, abilities, once, they, joined, humans, another, study, showed, that, after, undergoing, training, to, solve, a, simple, manipulation, task, dogs, faced, with, an, unsolvable, version, of, the, same, problem, look, at, humans, while, socialized, wolves, do, not, dog, communication, is, how, dogs, convey, information, to, other, dogs, understand, messages, from, humans, and, translate, the, information, that, dogs, are, transmitting, communication, behaviors, of, dogs, include, eye, gaze, facial, expression, vocalization, body, posture, including, movements, of, bodies, and, limbs, and, gustatory, communication, scents, pheromones, and, taste, dogs, mark, their, territories, by, urinating, on, them, which, is, more, likely, when, entering, a, new, environment, both, sexes, of, dogs, may, also, urinate, to, communicate, anxiety, or, frustration, submissiveness, or, when, in, exciting, or, relaxing, situations, aroused, dogs, can, be, a, result, of, the, dogs, higher, cortisol, levels, between, 3, and, 8, weeks, of, age, dogs, tend, to, focus, on, other, dogs, for, social, interaction, and, between, 5, and, 12, weeks, of, age, they, shift, their, focus, to, people, belly, exposure, in, dogs, can, be, a, defensive, behavior, that, can, lead, to, a, bite, or, to, seek, comfort, humans, communicate, with, dogs, by, using, vocalization, hand, signals, and, body, posture, with, their, acute, sense, of, hearing, dogs, rely, on, the, auditory, aspect, of, communication, for, understanding, and, responding, to, various, cues, including, the, distinctive, barking, patterns, that, convey, different, messages, a, study, using, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, has, shown, that, dogs, respond, to, both, vocal, and, nonvocal, voices, using, the, brain, s, region, towards, the, temporal, pole, similar, to, that, of, humans, brains, most, dogs, also, looked, significantly, longer, at, the, face, whose, expression, matched, the, valence, of, vocalization, a, study, of, caudate, responses, shows, that, dogs, tend, to, respond, more, positively, to, social, rewards, than, to, food, rewards, the, dog, is, probably, the, most, widely, abundant, large, carnivoran, living, in, the, human, environment, in, 2013, the, estimated, global, dog, population, was, between, 700, million, and, 987, million, about, 20, of, dogs, live, as, pets, in, developed, countries, in, the, developing, world, it, is, estimated, that, three, quarters, of, the, world, s, dog, population, lives, in, the, developing, world, as, feral, village, or, community, dogs, most, of, these, dogs, live, as, scavengers, and, have, never, been, owned, by, humans, with, one, study, showing, that, village, dogs, most, common, response, when, approached, by, strangers, is, to, run, away, 52, or, respond, aggressively, 11, feral, and, free, ranging, dogs, potential, to, compete, with, other, large, carnivores, is, limited, by, their, strong, association, with, humans, although, wolves, are, known, to, kill, dogs, they, tend, to, live, in, pairs, in, areas, where, they, are, highly, persecuted, giving, them, a, disadvantage, when, facing, large, dog, groups, in, some, instances, wolves, have, displayed, an, uncharacteristic, fearlessness, of, humans, and, buildings, when, attacking, dogs, to, the, extent, that, they, have, to, be, beaten, off, or, killed, although, the, numbers, of, dogs, killed, each, year, are, relatively, low, it, induces, a, fear, of, wolves, entering, villages, and, farmyards, to, take, dogs, and, losses, of, dogs, to, wolves, have, led, to, demands, for, more, liberal, wolf, hunting, regulations, coyotes, and, big, cats, have, also, been, known, to, attack, dogs, in, particular, leopards, are, known, to, have, a, preference, for, dogs, and, have, been, recorded, to, kill, and, consume, them, no, matter, their, size, siberian, tigers, in, the, amur, river, region, have, killed, dogs, in, the, middle, of, villages, amur, tigers, will,

dogs, as, introduced, predator, mammals, have, affected, the, ecology, of, new, zealand, which, lacked, indigenous, land, based, mammals, before, human, settlement, dogs, have, made, 11, vertebrate, species, extinct, and, are, identified, as, a, potential, threat, to, at, least, 188, threatened, species, worldwide, another, figure, is, that, dogs, have, also, been, linked, to, the, extinction, of, 156, animal, species, dogs, have, been, documented, to, have, killed, a, few, birds, of, the, endangered, species, the, kagu, in, new, caledonia, dogs, are, typically, described, as, omnivores, compared, to, wolves, dogs, from, agricultural, societies, have, extra, copies, of, amylase, and, other, genes, involved, in, starch, digestion, that, contribute, to, an, increased, ability, to, thrive, on, a, starch, rich, diet, similar, to, humans, some, dog, breeds, produce, amylase, in, their, saliva, and, are, classified, as, having, a, high, starch, diet, however, more, like, cats, and, less, like, other, omnivores, dogs, can, only, produce, bile, acid, with, taurine, and, they, cannot, produce, vitamin, d, which, they, obtain, from, animal, flesh, of, the, twenty, one, amino, acids, common, to, all, life, forms, including, selenocysteine, dogs, cannot, synthesize, ten, arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and, valine, like, cats, dogs, require, arginine, to, maintain, nitrogen, balance, these, nutritional, requirements, place, dogs, halfway, between, carnivores, and, omnivores, as, a, domesticated, or, semi, domesticated, animal, the, dog, has, notable, exceptions, of, presence, in, dogs, were, introduced, to, antarctica, as, sled, dogs, starting, practice, in, december, 1993, dogs, were, later, outlawed,

land, ice, shelves, or, sea, ice, the, domesticated, dog, apparently, originated, as, a, predator, and, scavenger, domestic, dogs, inherited, complex, behaviors, such, as, bite, inhibition, from, their, wolf, ancestors, which, would, have, been, pack, hunters, with, complex, body, language, these, sophisticated, forms, of, social, cognition, and, communication, may, account, for, dogs, trainability, playfulness, and, ability, to, fit, into, human, households, and, social, situations, and, probably, also, their, co, existence, with, early, human, hunter, gatherers, dogs, perform, many, roles, for, people, such, as, hunting, herding, pulling, loads, protection, assisting, police, and, the, military, companionship, and, aiding, disabled, individuals, these, roles, in, human, society, have, earned, them, the, nickname, man, s, best, friend, in, the, western, world, in, some, cultures, however, dogs, are, also, a, source, of, meat, the, keeping, of, dogs, as, companions,

status, major, shift, has, been, commodification, allowing, it, to, conform, to, social, expectations, of, personality, and, behavior, the, second, has, been, the, broadening, of, the, concepts, of, family, and, the, home, to, include, dogs, as, dogs, within, everyday, routines, and, practices, a, vast, range, of, commodity, forms, aim, to, transform, a, pet, dog, into, an, ideal, companion, the, list, of, goods, and, services, available, for, dogs, such, as, dog, training, books, classes, and, television, programs, has, increased, the, majority, of, contemporary, dog, owners, describe, their, pet, as, part, of, the, family, although, some, state, that, it, is, an, ambivalent, relationship, some, dog, trainers, have, promoted, a, dominance, model, of, dog, human, relationships, however, the, idea, of, the, alpha, dog, trying, to, be, dominant, is, based, on, a, controversial, theory, about, wolf, packs, it, has, been, disputed, that, trying, to, achieve, status, is, characteristic, of, dog, human, interactions, human, family, members, have, increased, participation, in, activities, in, which, the, dog, is, an, integral, partner, such, as, dog, dancing, and, dog, yoga, according,
