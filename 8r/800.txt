camelus, glama, linnaeus, 1758, the, llama, l, m, spanish, pronunciation, or, lama, glama, is, a, domesticated, south, american, camelid, widely, used, as, a, meat, and, pack, animal, by, andean, cultures, since, the, pre, columbian, era, llamas, are, social, animals, and, live, with, others, as, a, herd, their, wool, is, soft, and, contains, only, a, small, amount, of, lanolin, llamas, can, learn, simple, tasks, after, a, few, repetitions, when, using, a, pack, they, can, carry, about, 25, to, 30, of, their, body, weight, for, 8, to, 13, km, 5, 8, miles, the, name, llama, in, the, past, also, spelled, lama, or, glama, was, adopted, by, european, settlers, from, native, peruvians, the, ancestors, of, llamas, are, thought, to, have, originated, from, the, great, plains, of, north, america, about, 40, million, years, ago, and, subsequently, migrated, to, south, america, about, three, million, years, ago, during, the, great, american, interchange, by, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, 10, 000, 12, 000, years, ago, camelids, were, extinct, in, north, america, as, of, 2007, there, were, over, seven, million, llamas, and, alpacas, in, south, america, and, over, 158, 000, llamas, and, 100, 000, alpacas, descended, from, progenitors, imported, late, in, the, 20th, century, in, the, united, states, and, canada, in, aymara, mythology, llamas, are, important, beings, the, heavenly, llama, is, said, to, drink, water, from, the, ocean, and, urinates, as, it, rains, according, to, aymara, eschatology, llamas, will, return, to, the, water, springs, and, ponds, where, they, come, from, at, the, end, of, time, lamoids, or, llamas, as, they, are, more, generally, known, as, a, group, consist, of, the, vicu, a, vicugna, vicugna, prev, lama, vicugna, guanaco, lama, guanicoe, suri, alpaca, and, huacaya, alpaca, vicugna, pacos, prev, lama, guanicoe, pacos, and, the, domestic, llama, lama, glama, guanacos, and, vicu, as, live, in, the, wild, while, llamas, and, alpacas, exist, only, as, domesticated, animals, although, early, writers, compared, llamas, to, sheep, their, similarity, to, the, camel, was, soon, recognized, they, were, included, in, the, genus, camelus, along, with, alpaca, in, the, systema, naturae, 1758, of, carl, linnaeus, they, were, however, separated, by, georges, cuvier, in, 1800, under, the, name, of, lama, along, with, the, guanaco, dna, analysis, has, confirmed, that, the, guanaco, is, the, wild, ancestor, of, the, llama, while, the, vicu, a, is, the, wild, ancestor, of, the, alpaca, the, latter, two, were, placed, in, the, genus, vicugna, the, genera, lama, and, vicugna, are, with, the, two, species, of, true, camels, the, sole, existing, representatives, of, a, very, distinct, section, of, the, artiodactyla, or, even, toed, ungulates, called, tylopoda, or, bump, footed, from, the, peculiar, bumps, on, the, soles, of, their, feet, the, tylopoda, consists, of, a, single, family, the, camelidae, and, shares, the, order, artiodactyla, with, the, suina, pigs, the, tragulina, chevrotains, the, pecora, ruminants, and, the, whippomorpha, hippos, and, cetaceans, which, belong, to, artiodactyla, from, a, cladistic, if, not, traditional, standpoint, the, tylopoda, have, more, or, less, affinity, to, each, of, the, sister, taxa, standing, in, some, respects, in, a, middle, position, between, them, sharing, some, characteristics, from, each, but, in, others, showing, special, modifications, not, found, in, any, of, the, other, taxa, the, 19th, century, discoveries, of, a, vast, and, previously, unexpected, extinct, paleogene, fauna, of, north, america, as, interpreted, by, paleontologists, joseph, leidy, edward, drinker, cope, and, othniel, charles, marsh, aided, understanding, of, the, early, history, of, this, family, llamas, were, not, always, confined, to, south, america, abundant, llama, like, remains, were, found, in, pleistocene, deposits, in, the, rocky, mountains, and, in, central, america, some, of, the, fossil, llamas, were, much, larger, than, current, forms, some, species, remained, in, north, america, during, the, last, ice, ages, north, american, llamas, are, categorized, as, an, extinct, genus, hemiauchenia, llama, like, animals, would, have, been, a, common, sight, 25, 000, years, ago, in, modern, day, california, texas, new, mexico, utah, missouri, and, florida, the, camelid, lineage, has, a, good, fossil, record, camel, like, animals, have, been, traced, back, through, early, miocene, forms, from, the, thoroughly, differentiated, modern, species, their, characteristics, became, more, general, and, they, lost, those, that, distinguished, them, as, camelids, hence, they, were, classified, as, ancestral, artiodactyls, no, fossils, of, these, earlier, forms, have, been, found, in, the, old, world, indicating, that, north, america, was, the, original, home, of, camelids, and, that, the, ancestors, of, old, world, camels, crossed, over, via, the, bering, land, bridge, from, north, america, the, formation, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, three, million, years, ago, allowed, camelids, to, spread, to, south, america, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, where, they, evolved, further, meanwhile, north, american, camelids, died, out, at, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, a, full, grown, llama, can, reach, a, height, of, 1, 7, to, 1, 8, m, 5, ft, 7, in, to, 5, ft, 11, in, at, the, top, of, the, head, and, can, weigh, between, 130, and, 272, kg, 287, and, 600, lb, at, maturity, males, can, weigh, 94, 74, kg, while, females, can, weigh, 102, 27, kg, at, birth, a, baby, llama, called, a, cria, can, weigh, between, 9, and, 14, kg, 20, and, 31, lb, llamas, typically, live, for, 15, to, 25, years, with, some, individuals, surviving, 30, years, or, more, the, following, characteristics, apply, especially, to, llamas, dentition, of, adults, incisors, 1, 3, canines, 1, 1, premolars, 2, 2, molars, 3, 3, total, 32, in, the, upper, jaw, a, compressed, sharp, pointed, laniariform, incisor, near, the, hinder, edge, of, the, premaxilla, is, followed, in, the, male, at, least, by, a, moderate, sized, pointed, curved, true, canine, in, the, anterior, part, of, the, maxilla, the, isolated, canine, like, premolar, that, follows, in, the, camels, is, not, present, the, teeth, of, the, molar, series, which, are, in, contact, with, each, other, consist, of, two, very, small, premolars, the, first, almost, rudimentary, and, three, broad, molars, generally, constructed, like, those, of, camelus, in, the, lower, jaw, the, three, incisors, are, long, spatulate, and, procumbent, the, outer, ones, are, the, smallest, next, to, these, is, a, curved, suberect, canine, followed, after, an, interval, by, an, isolated, minute, and, often, deciduous, simple, conical, premolar, then, a, contiguous, series, of, one, premolar, and, three, molars, which, differ, from, those, of, camelus, in, having, a, small, accessory, column, at, the, anterior, outer, edge, the, skull, generally, resembles, that, of, camelus, with, a, larger, brain, cavity, and, orbits, and, less, developed, cranial, ridges, due, to, its, smaller, size, the, nasal, bones, are, shorter, and, broader, and, are, joined, by, the, premaxilla, vertebrae, the, ears, are, rather, long, and, slightly, curved, inward, characteristically, known, as, banana, shaped, there, is, no, dorsal, hump, the, feet, are, narrow, the, toes, being, more, separated, than, in, the, camels, each, having, a, distinct, plantar, pad, the, tail, is, short, and, the, fiber, is, long, woolly, and, soft, in, essential, structural, characteristics, as, well, as, in, general, appearance, and, habits, all, the, animals, of, this, genus, very, closely, resemble, each, other, so, whether, they, should, be, considered, as, belonging, to, one, two, or, more, species, is, a, matter, of, controversy, among, naturalists, the, question, is, complicated, by, the, circumstances, of, most, individuals, who, have, come, under, observation, either, in, a, completely, or, partially, domesticated, state, many, are, also, descended, from, ancestors, previously, domesticated, a, state, that, tends, to, produce, a, certain, amount, of, variation, from, the, original, type, the, four, forms, commonly, distinguished, by, the, inhabitants, of, south, america, are, recognized, as, distinct, species, though, there, are, difficulties, in, defining, their, distinctive, characteristics, these, are, the, llama, and, alpaca, are, only, known, in, the, domestic, state, and, are, variable, in, size, and, of, many, colors, often, white, brown, or, piebald, some, are, grey, or, black, the, guanaco, and, vicu, a, are, wild, the, guanaco, is, endangered, it, has, a, nearly, uniform, light, brown, color, passing, into, white, below, the, guanaco, and, vicu, a, certainly, differ, the, vicu, a, is, more, petite, more, slender, in, its, proportions, and, has, a, shorter, head, than, the, guanaco, the, vicu, a, lives, in, herds, on, the, bleak, and, elevated, parts, of, the, mountain, range, bordering, the, region, of, perpetual, snow, amidst, rocks, and, precipices, occurring, in, various, suitable, localities, throughout, peru, in, the, southern, part, of, ecuador, and, as, far, south, as, the, middle, of, bolivia, its, manners, very, much, resemble, those, of, the, chamois, of, the, european, alps, it, is, as, vigilant, wild, and, timid, vicu, a, fiber, is, extremely, delicate, and, soft, and, highly, valued, for, weaving, but, the, quantity, that, each, animal, produces, is, small, alpacas, are, primarily, descended, from, wild, vicu, a, ancestors, in, contrast, domesticated, llamas, are, descended, primarily, from, wild, guanaco, ancestors, although, a, considerable, amount, of, hybridization, between, the, two, species, has, occurred, differential, characteristics, between, llamas, and, alpacas, include, the, llama, s, larger, size, longer, head, and, curved, ears, alpaca, fiber, is, generally, more, expensive, but, not, always, more, valuable, alpacas, tend, to, have, a, more, consistent, color, throughout, the, body, the, most, apparent, visual, difference, between, llamas, and, camels, is, that, camels, have, a, humps, and, llamas, do, not, llamas, are, not, ruminants, pseudo, ruminants, or, modified, ruminants, they, do, have, a, complex, three, compartment, stomach, that, allows, them, to, digest, lower, quality, high, cellulose, foods, the, stomach, compartments, allow, for, fermentation, of, tricky, foodstuffs, followed, by, regurgitation, and, re, chewing, ruminants, cows, sheep, goats, have, four, compartments, whereas, llamas, have, only, three, stomach, compartments, the, rumen, omasum, and, abomasum, in, addition, the, llama, and, other, camelids, have, an, extremely, long, and, complex, large, intestine, colon, the, large, intestine, s, role, in, digestion, is, to, reabsorb, water, vitamins, and, electrolytes, from, food, waste, passing, through, it, the, length, of, the, llama, s, colon, allows, it, to, survive, on, much, less, water, than, other, animals, this, is, a, major, advantage, in, arid, climates, where, they, live, llamas, have, an, unusual, reproductive, cycle, for, a, large, animal, female, llamas, are, induced, ovulators, through, mating, the, female, releases, an, egg, and, is, often, fertilized, on, the, first, attempt, female, llamas, do, not, go, into, estrus, heat, like, humans, llama, males, and, females, mature, sexually, at, different, rates, females, reach, puberty, at, about, 12, months, old, males, do, not, become, sexually, mature, until, around, three, years, of, age, llamas, mate, in, a, kush, lying, down, position, similar, to, big, cats, and, canines, which, is, unusual, in, a, large, animal, they, mate, for, an, extended, time, 20, 45, minutes, also, unusual, in, a, large, animal, the, gestation, period, of, a, llama, is, 11, 5, months, 350, days, dams, female, llamas, do, not, lick, off, their, babies, as, they, have, an, attached, tongue, that, does, not, reach, outside, of, the, mouth, more, than, 13, millimetres, 1, 2, inch, rather, they, will, nuzzle, and, hum, to, their, newborns, a, cria, from, spanish, for, baby, is, the, name, for, a, baby, llama, alpaca, vicu, a, or, guanaco, crias, are, typically, born, with, all, the, herd, s, females, gathering, to, protect, against, the, male, llamas, and, potential, predators, llamas, give, birth, standing, birth, is, usually, quick, and, problem, free, over, in, less, than, 30, minutes, most, births, occur, between, 8, am, and, noon, during, the, warmer, daylight, hours, this, may, increase, cria, survival, by, reducing, fatalities, due, to, hypothermia, during, cold, andean, nights, this, birthing, pattern, is, considered, a, continuation, of, the, birthing, patterns, observed, in, the, wild, their, crias, are, up, and, standing, walking, and, attempting, to, suckle, within, the, first, hour, after, birth, crias, are, partially, fed, with, llama, milk, that, is, lower, in, fat, and, salt, and, higher, in, phosphorus, and, calcium, than, cow, or, goat, milk, a, female, llama, will, only, produce, about, 60, millilitres, 2, us, fluid, ounces, of, milk, at, a, time, when, she, gives, milk, so, the, cria, must, frequently, suckle, to, receive, the, nutrients, it, requires, in, harem, mating, the, male, is, left, with, females, most, of, the, year, for, field, mating, a, female, is, turned, into, a, field, with, a, male, llama, and, left, there, for, some, time, this, is, the, easiest, method, in, terms, of, labor, but, the, least, useful, in, predicting, a, likely, birth, date, an, ultrasound, test, can, be, performed, and, together, with, the, exposure, dates, a, better, idea, of, when, the, cria, is, expected, can, be, determined, hand, mating, is, the, most, efficient, method, but, it, requires, the, most, work, on, the, part, of, the, human, involved, a, male, and, female, llama, are, put, into, the, same, pen, and, mating, is, monitored, they, are, then, separated, and, re, mated, every, other, day, until, one, refuses, the, mating, usually, one, can, get, in, two, matings, using, this, method, though, some, stud, males, routinely, refuse, to, mate, a, female, more, than, once, the, separation, presumably, helps, to, keep, the, sperm, count, high, for, each, mating, and, also, helps, to, keep, the, condition, of, the, female, llama, s, reproductive, tract, more, sound, if, the, mating, is, unsuccessful, within, two, to, three, weeks, the, female, is, mated, again, options, for, feeding, llamas, are, quite, wide, various, commercial, and, farm, based, feeds, are, available, the, major, determining, factors, include, feed, cost, availability, nutrient, balance, and, energy, density, required, young, actively, growing, llamas, require, a, greater, concentration, of, nutrients, than, mature, animals, because, of, their, smaller, digestive, tract, capacities, llamas, that, are, well, socialized, and, trained, to, halter, and, lead, after, weaning, are, very, friendly, and, pleasant, to, be, around, they, are, extremely, curious, and, most, will, approach, people, easily, however, llamas, that, are, bottle, fed, or, over, socialized, and, over, handled, as, youth, will, become, extremely, difficult, to, handle, when, mature, when, they, will, begin, to, treat, humans, as, they, treat, each, other, which, is, characterized, by, bouts, of, spitting, kicking, and, neck, wrestling, llamas, are, now, utilized, as, certified, therapy, animals, in, nursing, homes, and, hospitals, rojo, the, llama, located, in, the, pacific, northwest, was, certified, in, 2008, the, mayo, clinic, says, animal, assisted, therapy, can, reduce, pain, depression, anxiety, and, fatigue, this, type, of, therapy, is, growing, in, popularity, and, several, organizations, throughout, the, united, states, participate, when, correctly, reared, llamas, spitting, at, a, human, is, a, rare, thing, llamas, are, very, social, herd, animals, however, and, sometimes, spit, at, each, other, to, discipline, lower, ranked, llamas, a, llama, s, social, rank, in, a, herd, is, never, static, they, can, always, move, up, or, down, the, social, ladder, by, picking, small, fights, this, is, usually, done, between, males, to, see, which, will, become, dominant, their, fights, are, visually, dramatic, characterized, by, spitting, ramming, each, other, with, their, chests, neck, wrestling, and, kicking, mainly, to, knock, the, other, off, balance, the, females, are, usually, only, seen, spitting, to, control, other, herd, members, one, may, determine, how, agitated, the, llama, is, by, the, materials, in, the, spit, the, more, irritated, the, llama, is, the, further, back, into, each, of, the, three, stomach, compartments, it, will, try, to, draw, materials, from, for, its, spit, while, the, social, structure, might, constantly, change, they, live, as, a, family, and, care, for, each, other, if, one, notices, a, strange, noise, or, feels, threatened, an, alarm, call, a, loud, shrill, sound, that, rhythmically, rises, and, falls, is, sent, out, and, all, others, become, alert, they, will, often, hum, to, each, other, as, a, form, of, communication, the, llama, s, groaning, noises, or, going, mwa, mwa, is, often, a, sign, of, fear, or, anger, unhappy, or, agitated, llamas, will, lay, their, ears, back, while, ears, being, perked, upwards, is, a, sign, of, happiness, or, curiosity, an, orgle, is, the, mating, sound, of, a, llama, or, alpaca, made, by, the, sexually, aroused, male, the, sound, is, reminiscent, of, gargling, but, with, a, more, forceful, buzzing, edge, males, begin, the, sound, when, they, become, aroused, and, continue, throughout, copulation, using, llamas, as, livestock, guards, in, north, america, began, in, the, early, 1980s, and, some, sheep, producers, have, used, llamas, successfully, since, then, some, would, even, use, them, to, guard, their, smaller, cousins, the, alpaca, they, are, used, most, commonly, in, the, western, regions, of, the, united, states, where, larger, predators, such, as, coyotes, and, feral, dogs, are, prevalent, typically, a, single, gelding, castrated, male, is, used, research, suggests, using, multiple, guard, llamas, is, not, as, effective, as, one, multiple, males, tend, to, bond, with, one, another, rather, than, with, the, livestock, and, may, ignore, the, flock, a, gelded, male, of, two, years, of, age, bonds, closely, with, its, new, charges, and, is, instinctively, very, effective, in, preventing, predation, some, llamas, bond, more, quickly, to, sheep, or, goats, if, introduced, just, before, lambing, many, sheep, and, goat, producers, indicate, a, special, bond, quickly, develops, between, lambs, and, their, guard, llama, and, the, llama, is, particularly, protective, of, the, lambs, using, llamas, as, guards, has, reduced, the, losses, to, predators, for, many, producers, the, value, of, the, livestock, saved, each, year, exceeds, a, llama, s, purchase, cost, and, annual, maintenance, although, not, every, llama, is, suited, to, the, job, most, are, a, viable, nonlethal, alternative, for, reducing, predation, requiring, no, training, and, little, care, llamas, have, a, fine, undercoat, which, can, be, used, for, handicrafts, and, garments, the, coarser, outer, guard, hair, is, used, for, rugs, wall, hangings, and, lead, ropes, the, fiber, comes, in, many, colors, ranging, from, white, or, grey, to, reddish, brown, brown, dark, brown, and, black, doctors, and, researchers, have, determined, that, llamas, possess, antibodies, that, are, well, suited, to, treat, certain, diseases, scientists, have, been, studying, the, way, llamas, might, contribute, to, the, fight, against, coronaviruses, including, mers, and, sars, cov, 2, which, causes, covid, 19, scholar, alex, chepstow, lusty, has, argued, that, the, switch, from, a, hunter, gatherer, lifestyle, to, widespread, agriculture, was, only, possible, because, of, the, use, of, llama, dung, as, fertilizer, the, moche, people, frequently, placed, llamas, and, their, parts, in, the, burials, of, important, people, as, offerings, or, provisions, for, the, afterlife, the, moche, of, pre, columbian, peru, depicted, llamas, quite, realistically, in, their, ceramics, in, the, inca, empire, llamas, were, the, only, beasts, of, burden, and, many, of, the, people, dominated, by, the, inca, had, long, traditions, of, llama, herding, for, the, inca, nobility, the, llama, was, symbolic, and, llama, figures, were, often, buried, with, the, dead, in, south, america, llamas, are, still, used, as, beasts, of, burden, as, well, as, for, the, production, of, fiber, and, meat, the, inca, deity, urcuchillay, was, depicted, in, the, form, of, a, multicolored, llama, carl, troll, has, argued, that, the, large, numbers, of, llamas, found, in, the, southern, peruvian, highlands, were, an, essential, factor, in, the, rise, of, the, inca, empire, it, is, worth, considering, the, maximum, extent, of, the, inca, empire, roughly, coincided, with, the, most, significant, distribution, of, alpacas, and, llamas, in, pre, hispanic, america, the, link, between, the, andean, biomes, of, puna, and, p, ramo, llama, pastoralism, and, the, inca, state, is, a, matter, of, research, one, of, the, main, uses, for, llamas, at, the, time, of, the, spanish, conquest, was, to, bring, down, ore, from, the, mines, in, the, mountains, gregory, de, bolivar, estimated, that, in, his, day, as, many, as, 300, 000, were, employed, in, the, transport, of, produce, from, the, potos, mines, alone, but, since, the, introduction, of, horses, mules, and, donkeys, the, importance, of, the, llama, as, a, beast, of, burden, has, greatly, diminished, according, to, juan, ignacio, molina, the, dutch, captain, joris, van, spilbergen, observed, the, use, of, hueques, possibly, a, llama, type, by, native, mapuches, of, mocha, island, as, plow, animals, in, 1614, in, chile, hueque, populations, declined, towards, extinction, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, century, being, replaced, by, european, livestock, the, causes, of, its, extinction, are, not, clear, however, it, is, known, that, the, introduction, of, sheep, caused, some, competition, among, both, domestic, species, anecdotal, evidence, of, the, mid, 17th, century, shows, that, both, species, coexisted, and, suggests, that, there, were, many, more, sheep, than, hueques, the, decline, of, hueques, reached, a, point, in, the, late, 18th, century, when, only, the, mapuche, from, mariquina, and, huequ, n, next, to, angol, raised, the, animal, llamas, were, first, imported, into, the, us, in, the, late, 1800s, as, zoo, exhibits, restrictions, on, importation, of, livestock, from, south, america, due, to, hoof, and, mouth, disease, combined, with, lack, of, commercial, interest, resulted, in, the, number, of, llamas, staying, low, until, the, late, 20th, century, in, the, 1970s, interest, in, llamas, as, livestock, began, to, grow, and, the, number, of, llamas, increased, as, farmers, bred, and, produced, an, increasing, number, of, animals, both, the, price, and, number, of, llamas, in, the, us, climbed, rapidly, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, with, little, market, for, llama, fiber, or, meat, in, the, us, and, the, value, of, guard, llamas, limited, the, primary, value, in, llamas, was, in, breeding, more, animals, a, classic, sign, of, a, speculative, bubble, in, agriculture, by, 2002, there, were, almost, 145, 000, llamas, in, the, us, according, to, the, us, department, of, agriculture, and, animals, sold, for, as, much, as, 220, 000, however, the, lack, of, any, end, market, for, the, animals, resulted, in, a, crash, in, both, llama, prices, and, the, number, of, llamas, the, great, recession, further, dried, up, investment, capital, and, the, number, of, llamas, in, the, us, began, to, decline, as, fewer, animals, were, bred, and, older, animals, died, of, old, age, by, 2017, the, number, of, llamas, in, the, us, had, dropped, below, 40, 000, a, similar, speculative, bubble, was, experienced, with, the, closely, related, alpaca, which, burst, shortly, after, the, llama, bubble, being, an, important, animal, and, long, standing, cultural, icon, in, south, america, llamas, gained, in, recent, history, cultural, prominence, in, western, culture, for, example, the, videogame, company, maxis, has, used, llamas, extensively, as, elements, in, their, games, particularly, in, the, widely, popular, game, series, the, sims, llamas, being, the, national, symbol, of, the, country, the, broader, series, of, sim, games, are, set, in, the, online, video, game, fortnite, uses, pi, ata, llamas, as, loot, containers, which, contain, various, in, game, resources, also, the, programming, language, perl, with, its, so, called, llama, book, has, been, associated, with, llamas
