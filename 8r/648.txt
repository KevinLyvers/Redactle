some, 5, 10, living, see, article, text, the, gruiformes, r, u, f, r, m, i, z, are, an, order, containing, a, considerable, number, of, living, and, extinct, bird, families, with, a, widespread, geographical, diversity, gruiform, means, crane, like, traditionally, a, number, of, wading, and, terrestrial, bird, families, that, did, not, seem, to, belong, to, any, other, order, were, classified, together, as, gruiformes, these, include, 15, species, of, large, cranes, about, 145, species, of, smaller, crakes, and, rails, as, well, as, a, variety, of, families, comprising, one, to, three, species, such, as, the, heliornithidae, the, limpkin, or, the, psophiidae, other, birds, have, been, placed, in, this, order, more, out, of, necessity, to, place, them, somewhere, this, has, caused, the, expanded, gruiformes, to, lack, distinctive, apomorphies, recent, studies, indicate, that, these, odd, gruiformes, are, if, at, all, only, loosely, related, to, the, cranes, rails, and, relatives, core, gruiformes, there, are, only, two, suprafamilial, clades, natural, groups, among, the, birds, traditionally, classified, as, gruiformes, rails, rallidae, flufftails, sarothruridae, finfoots, and, sungrebe, heliornithidae, adzebills, aptornithidae, trumpeters, psophiidae, limpkin, aramidae, and, cranes, gruidae, compose, the, suborder, grues, and, are, termed, core, gruiformes, these, are, the, only, true, gruiformes, the, suborder, eurypygae, includes, the, kagu, rhynochetidae, and, sunbittern, eurypygidae, these, are, not, even, remotely, related, to, grues, the, families, of, mesites, or, roatelos, mesitornithidae, button, quails, turnicidae, australian, plains, wanderer, pedionomidae, seriemas, cariamidae, and, bustards, otididae, each, represent, distinct, and, unrelated, lineages, many, families, known, only, from, fossils, have, been, assigned, to, the, gruiformes, e, g, ergilornithidae, phorusrhacidae, messelornithidae, eogruidae, idiornithidae, bathornithidae, to, name, just, a, few, see, below, though, some, of, these, are, superficially, crane, like, and, the, possibility, exists, that, some, may, even, be, related, to, extant, families, traditionally, included, in, the, gruiformes, there, are, no, completely, extinct, families, that, can, be, confidently, assigned, to, core, gruiformes, the, traditional, order, gruiformes, was, established, by, the, influential, german, avian, comparative, anatomist, max, f, rbringer, 1888, over, the, decades, many, ornithologists, suggested, that, members, of, the, order, were, in, fact, more, closely, related, to, other, groups, reviewed, by, olson, 1985, sibley, and, ahlquist, 1990, for, example, it, was, thought, that, sunbittern, might, be, related, to, herons, and, that, seriemas, might, be, related, to, cuckoos, olson, and, steadman, 1981, were, first, to, correctly, disband, any, of, the, traditional, gruiformes, they, recognized, that, the, australian, plains, wanderer, family, pedionomidae, was, actually, a, member, of, the, shorebirds, order, charadriiformes, based, on, skeletal, characters, this, was, confirmed, by, sibley, and, ahlquist, 1990, based, on, dna, dna, hybridization, and, subsequently, by, paton, et, al, 2003, paton, and, baker, 2006, and, fain, and, houde, 2004, 2006, sibley, and, ahlquist, furthermore, removed, button, quails, turnicidae, from, the, gruiformes, based, on, large, dna, dna, hybridization, distances, to, other, supposed, gruiformes, however, it, was, not, until, the, work, of, paton, et, al, 2004, and, fain, and, houde, 2004, 2006, that, the, correct, placement, of, buttonquails, within, the, shorebirds, order, charadriiformes, was, documented, on, the, basis, of, phylogenetic, analysis, of, multiple, genetic, loci, using, 12s, ribosomal, dna, sequences, houde, et, al, 1997, were, the, first, to, present, molecular, genetic, evidence, of, gruiform, polyphyly, although, apparently, they, were, not, convinced, by, it, however, on, the, basis, of, numerous, additional, sequence, data, it, has, been, shown, decisively, that, the, traditionally, recognized, gruiformes, consist, of, five, to, seven, unrelated, clades, fain, and, houde, 2004, ericson, et, al, 2006, hackett, et, al, 2008, fain, and, houde, 2004, proposed, that, neoaves, are, divisible, into, two, clades, metaves, and, coronaves, although, it, has, been, suggested, from, the, start, that, metaves, may, be, paraphyletic, fain, and, houde, 2004, ericson, et, al, 2006, hackett, et, al, 2008, sunbittern, kagu, and, mesites, all, group, within, metaves, but, all, the, other, lineages, of, gruiformes, group, either, with, a, collection, of, waterbirds, or, landbirds, within, coronaves, this, division, has, been, upheld, by, the, combined, analysis, of, as, many, as, 30, independent, loci, ericson, et, al, 2006, hackett, et, al, 2008, but, is, dependent, on, the, inclusion, of, one, or, two, specific, loci, in, the, analyses, one, locus, i, e, mitochondrial, dna, contradicts, the, strict, monophyly, of, coronaves, morgan, richards, et, al, 2008, but, phylogeny, reconstruction, based, on, mitochondrial, dna, is, complicated, by, the, fact, that, few, families, have, been, studied, the, sequences, are, heavily, saturated, with, back, mutations, at, deep, levels, of, divergence, and, they, are, plagued, by, strong, base, composition, bias, the, kagu, and, sunbittern, are, one, another, s, closest, relatives, it, had, been, proposed, cracraft, 2001, that, they, and, the, recently, extinct, adzebills, family, aptornithidae, from, new, zealand, constitute, a, distinct, gondwanan, lineage, however, sunbittern, and, kagu, are, believed, to, have, diverged, from, one, another, long, after, the, break, up, of, gondwanaland, and, the, adzebills, are, in, fact, members, of, the, grues, houde, et, al, 1997, houde, 2009, the, seriemas, and, bustards, represent, distinct, lineages, within, neoavian, waterbirds, psophiidae, trumpeters, 3, species, aramidae, limpkin, gruidae, cranes, 15, species, rallidae, rails, crakes, and, coots, 152, species, heliornithidae, finfoots, 3, species, sarothruridae, flufftails, 15, species, gruiformes, when, considered, to, be, monophyletic, it, was, assumed, that, gruiformes, was, among, the, more, ancient, of, avian, lineages, the, divergence, of, gruiforms, among, metaves, and, coronaves, is, proposed, to, be, the, first, divergence, among, neoaves, far, predating, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, c, 66, mya, houde, 2009, no, unequivocal, basal, gruiforms, are, known, from, the, fossil, record, however, there, are, several, genera, that, are, not, unequivocally, assignable, to, the, known, families, and, that, may, occupy, a, more, basal, position, other, even, more, enigmatic, fossil, birds, and, five, living, families, are, occasionally, suggested, to, belong, into, this, order, such, as, the, proposed, late, cretaceous, family, laornithidae, and, the, following, taxa
