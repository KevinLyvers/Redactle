some, 40, living, and, see, below, rails, avian, family, rallidae, are, a, large, cosmopolitan, family, of, small, to, medium, sized, terrestrial, and, or, semi, amphibious, birds, the, family, exhibits, considerable, diversity, in, its, forms, and, includes, such, ubiquitous, species, as, the, crakes, coots, and, gallinule, other, rail, species, are, extremely, rare, or, endangered, many, are, associated, with, wetland, habitats, some, being, semi, aquatic, like, waterfowl, such, as, the, coot, but, many, more, are, wading, birds, or, shorebirds, the, ideal, rail, habitats, are, marsh, areas, including, rice, paddies, and, flooded, fields, or, open, forest, they, are, especially, fond, of, dense, vegetation, for, nesting, the, rail, family, is, found, in, every, terrestrial, habitat, with, the, exception, of, dry, desert, polar, or, freezing, regions, and, alpine, areas, above, the, snow, line, members, of, rallidae, occur, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, numerous, unique, island, species, are, known, rail, is, the, anglicized, respelling, of, the, french, r, le, from, old, french, rasle, it, is, named, from, its, harsh, cry, in, vulgar, latin, rascula, from, latin, r, dere, to, scrape, the, rails, are, a, family, of, small, to, medium, sized, ground, living, birds, they, vary, in, length, from, 12, to, 63, cm, 5, to, 25, in, and, in, weight, from, 20, to, 3, 000, g, 0, 7, oz, to, 6, lb, 10, oz, some, species, have, long, necks, and, in, many, cases, are, laterally, compressed, the, bill, is, the, most, variable, feature, within, the, family, in, some, species, it, is, longer, than, the, head, like, the, clapper, rail, of, the, americas, in, others, it, may, be, short, and, wide, as, in, the, coots, or, massive, as, in, the, purple, gallinules, a, few, coots, and, gallinules, have, a, frontal, shield, which, is, a, fleshy, rearward, extension, of, the, upper, bill, the, most, complex, frontal, shield, is, found, in, the, horned, coot, rails, exhibit, very, little, sexual, dimorphism, in, either, plumage, or, size, two, exceptions, are, the, watercock, gallicrex, cinerea, and, the, little, crake, zapornia, parva, the, wings, of, all, rails, are, short, and, rounded, the, flight, of, those, rallidae, able, to, fly, while, not, powerful, can, be, sustained, for, long, periods, of, time, and, many, species, migrate, annually, the, weakness, of, their, flight, however, means, they, are, easily, blown, off, course, thus, making, them, common, vagrants, a, characteristic, that, has, led, them, to, colonize, many, isolated, oceanic, islands, furthermore, these, birds, often, prefer, to, run, rather, than, fly, especially, in, dense, habitat, some, are, also, flightless, at, some, time, during, their, moult, periods, flightlessness, in, rails, is, one, of, the, best, examples, of, parallel, evolution, in, the, animal, kingdom, of, the, roughly, 150, historically, known, rail, species, 31, extant, or, recently, extinct, species, evolved, flightlessness, from, volant, flying, ancestors, this, process, created, the, endemic, populations, of, flightless, rails, seen, on, pacific, islands, today, many, island, rails, are, flightless, because, small, island, habitats, without, mammalian, predators, eliminate, the, need, to, fly, or, move, long, distances, flight, makes, intense, demands, with, the, keel, and, flight, muscles, taking, up, to, 40, of, a, bird, s, weight, reducing, the, flight, muscles, with, a, corresponding, lowering, of, metabolic, demands, reduces, the, flightless, rail, s, energy, expenditures, for, this, reason, flightlessness, makes, it, easier, to, survive, and, colonize, an, island, where, resources, may, be, limited, this, also, allows, for, the, evolution, of, multiple, sizes, of, flightless, rails, on, the, same, island, as, the, birds, diversify, to, fill, niches, in, addition, to, energy, conservation, certain, morphological, traits, also, affect, rail, evolution, rails, have, relatively, small, flight, muscles, and, wings, to, begin, with, in, rails, the, flight, muscles, make, up, only, 12, 17, of, their, overall, body, mass, this, in, combination, with, their, terrestrial, habits, and, behavioral, flightlessness, is, a, significant, contributor, to, the, rail, s, remarkably, fast, loss, of, flight, as, few, as, 125, 000, years, were, needed, for, the, laysan, rail, to, lose, the, power, of, flight, and, evolve, the, reduced, stubby, wings, only, useful, to, keep, balance, when, running, quickly, indeed, some, argue, that, measuring, the, evolution, of, flightlessness, in, rails, in, generations, rather, than, millennia, might, be, possible, another, factor, that, contributes, to, the, occurrence, of, the, flightless, state, is, a, climate, that, does, not, necessitate, seasonal, long, distance, migration, this, is, evidenced, by, the, tendency, to, evolve, flightlessness, at, a, much, greater, occurrence, in, tropical, islands, than, in, temperate, or, polar, islands, it, is, paradoxical, since, rails, appear, loath, to, fly, that, the, evolution, of, flightless, rails, would, necessitate, high, dispersal, to, isolated, islands, nonetheless, three, species, of, small, massed, rails, gallirallus, philippensis, porphyrio, porphyrio, and, porzana, tabuensis, exhibit, a, persistently, high, ability, to, disperse, long, distances, among, tropic, pacific, islands, though, only, the, latter, two, gave, rise, to, flightless, endemic, species, throughout, the, pacific, basin, in, examining, the, phylogeny, of, g, philippensis, although, the, species, is, clearly, polyphyletic, it, has, more, than, one, ancestral, species, it, is, not, the, ancestor, of, most, of, its, flightless, descendants, revealing, that, the, flightless, condition, evolved, in, rails, before, speciation, was, complete, a, consequence, of, lowered, energy, expenditure, in, flightless, island, rails, has, also, been, associated, with, evolution, of, their, tolerance, and, approachability, for, example, the, non, rallidae, corsican, blue, tits, exhibit, lower, aggression, and, reduced, territorial, defense, behaviors, than, do, their, mainland, european, counterparts, but, this, tolerance, may, be, limited, to, close, relatives, the, resulting, kin, selecting, altruistic, phenomena, reallocate, resources, to, produce, fewer, young, that, are, more, competitive, and, would, benefit, the, population, as, an, entirety, rather, than, many, young, that, would, exhibit, less, fitness, unfortunately, with, the, human, occupation, of, most, islands, in, the, past, 5, 000, to, 35, 000, years, selection, has, undoubtedly, reversed, the, tolerance, into, a, wariness, of, humans, and, predators, causing, species, unequipped, for, the, change, to, become, susceptible, to, extinction, in, general, members, of, the, rallidae, are, omnivorous, generalists, many, species, eat, invertebrates, as, well, as, fruit, or, seedlings, a, few, species, are, primarily, herbivorous, the, calls, of, rallidae, species, vary, and, are, often, quite, loud, some, are, whistle, like, or, squeak, like, while, others, seem, unbirdlike, loud, calls, are, useful, in, dense, vegetation, or, at, night, where, seeing, another, member, of, the, species, is, difficult, some, calls, are, territorial, the, most, typical, family, members, occupy, dense, vegetation, in, damp, environments, near, lakes, swamps, or, rivers, reed, beds, are, a, particularly, favoured, habitat, those, that, migrate, do, so, at, night, most, nest, in, dense, vegetation, in, general, they, are, shy, secretive, and, difficult, to, observe, most, species, walk, and, run, vigorously, on, strong, legs, and, have, long, toes, that, are, well, adapted, to, soft, uneven, surfaces, they, tend, to, have, short, rounded, wings, and, although, they, are, generally, weak, fliers, they, are, nevertheless, capable, of, covering, long, distances, island, species, often, become, flightless, and, many, of, them, are, now, extinct, following, the, introduction, of, terrestrial, predators, such, as, cats, foxes, weasels, mongooses, rats, and, pigs, many, reedbed, species, are, secretive, apart, from, loud, calls, crepuscular, and, have, laterally, flattened, bodies, in, the, old, world, long, billed, species, tend, to, be, called, rails, and, short, billed, species, crakes, north, american, species, are, normally, called, rails, irrespective, of, bill, length, the, smallest, of, these, is, swinhoe, s, rail, at, 13, cm, 5, 1, in, and, 25, g, the, larger, species, are, also, sometimes, given, other, names, the, black, coots, are, more, adapted, to, open, water, than, their, relatives, and, some, other, large, species, are, called, gallinules, and, swamphens, the, largest, of, this, group, is, the, takah, at, 65, cm, 26, in, and, 2, 7, kg, 6, 0, lb, the, rails, have, suffered, disproportionally, from, human, changes, to, the, environment, and, an, estimated, several, hundred, species, of, island, rails, have, become, extinct, because, of, this, several, island, species, of, rails, remain, endangered, and, conservation, organisations, and, governments, continue, to, work, to, prevent, their, extinction, the, breeding, behaviors, of, many, rallidae, species, are, poorly, understood, or, unknown, most, are, thought, to, be, monogamous, although, polygyny, and, polyandry, have, been, reported, most, often, they, lay, five, to, 10, eggs, clutches, as, small, as, one, or, as, large, as, 15, eggs, are, known, egg, clutches, may, not, always, hatch, at, the, same, time, chicks, become, mobile, after, a, few, days, they, often, depend, on, their, parents, until, fledging, which, happens, around, 1, month, old, some, larger, more, abundant, rails, are, hunted, and, their, eggs, collected, for, food, the, wake, island, rail, was, hunted, to, extinction, by, the, starving, japanese, garrison, after, the, island, was, cut, off, from, supply, during, world, war, ii, at, least, two, species, the, common, moorhen, and, the, american, purple, gallinule, have, been, considered, pests, due, to, their, tendencies, towards, flightlessness, many, island, species, have, been, unable, to, cope, with, introduced, species, the, most, dramatic, human, caused, extinctions, occurred, in, the, pacific, ocean, as, people, colonised, the, islands, of, melanesia, polynesia, and, micronesia, during, which, an, estimated, 750, 1800, species, of, birds, became, extinct, half, of, which, were, rails, some, species, that, came, close, to, extinction, such, as, the, lord, howe, woodhen, and, the, takah, have, made, modest, recoveries, due, to, the, efforts, of, conservation, organisations, the, guam, rail, came, perilously, close, to, extinction, when, brown, tree, snakes, were, introduced, to, guam, but, some, of, the, last, remaining, individuals, were, taken, into, captivity, and, are, breeding, well, though, attempts, at, reintroduction, have, met, with, mixed, results, the, family, rallidae, was, introduced, as, rallia, by, the, french, polymath, constantine, samuel, rafinesque, in, 1815, the, family, has, traditionally, been, grouped, with, two, families, of, larger, birds, the, cranes, and, bustards, as, well, as, several, smaller, families, of, usually, primitive, midsized, amphibious, birds, to, make, up, the, order, gruiformes, the, alternative, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, which, has, been, widely, accepted, in, america, raises, the, family, to, ordinal, level, as, the, ralliformes, given, uncertainty, about, gruiform, monophyly, this, may, or, may, not, be, correct, it, certainly, seems, more, justified, than, most, of, the, sibley, ahlquist, proposals, however, such, a, group, would, probably, also, include, the, heliornithidae, finfoots, and, sungrebes, an, exclusively, tropical, group, that, is, somewhat, convergent, with, grebes, and, usually, united, with, the, rails, in, the, ralli, the, cladogram, below, showing, the, phylogeny, of, the, living, and, recently, extinct, rallidae, is, based, on, a, study, by, juan, garcia, r, and,
