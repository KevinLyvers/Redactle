monotremes, m, n, t, r, i, m, z, are, mammals, of, the, order, monotremata, they, are, the, only, known, group, of, living, mammals, that, lay, eggs, rather, than, bearing, live, young, the, extant, monotreme, species, are, the, platypus, and, the, four, species, of, echidnas, monotremes, are, typified, by, structural, differences, in, their, brains, jaws, digestive, tract, reproductive, tract, and, other, body, parts, compared, to, the, more, common, mammalian, types, although, they, are, different, from, almost, all, mammals, in, that, they, lay, eggs, like, all, mammals, the, female, monotremes, nurse, their, young, with, milk, monotremes, have, been, considered, by, some, authors, to, be, members, of, australosphenida, a, clade, that, contains, extinct, mammals, from, the, jurassic, and, cretaceous, of, madagascar, south, america, and, australia, but, this, categorization, is, disputed, and, their, taxonomy, is, under, debate, all, extant, species, of, monotremes, are, indigenous, to, australia, and, new, guinea, although, they, were, also, present, during, the, late, cretaceous, and, paleocene, epochs, in, southern, south, america, implying, that, they, were, also, present, in, antarctica, though, remains, have, not, yet, been, found, there, the, name, monotreme, derives, from, the, greek, words, mon, s, single, and, tr, ma, hole, referring, to, the, cloaca, like, other, mammals, monotremes, are, endothermic, with, a, high, metabolic, rate, though, not, as, high, as, other, mammals, see, below, have, hair, on, their, bodies, produce, milk, through, mammary, glands, to, feed, their, young, have, a, single, bone, in, their, lower, jaw, and, have, three, middle, ear, bones, in, common, with, reptiles, and, marsupials, monotremes, lack, the, connective, structure, corpus, callosum, which, in, placental, mammals, is, the, primary, communication, route, between, the, right, and, left, brain, hemispheres, the, anterior, commissure, does, provide, an, alternate, communication, route, between, the, two, hemispheres, though, and, in, monotremes, and, marsupials, it, carries, all, the, commissural, fibers, arising, from, the, neocortex, whereas, in, placental, mammals, the, anterior, commissure, carries, only, some, of, these, fibers, extant, monotremes, lack, teeth, as, adults, fossil, forms, and, modern, platypus, young, have, a, tribosphenic, form, of, molars, with, the, occlusal, surface, formed, by, three, cusps, arranged, in, a, triangle, which, is, one, of, the, hallmarks, of, extant, mammals, some, recent, work, suggests, that, monotremes, acquired, this, form, of, molar, independently, of, placental, mammals, and, marsupials, although, this, hypothesis, remains, disputed, tooth, loss, in, modern, monotremes, might, be, related, to, their, development, of, electrolocation, monotreme, jaws, are, constructed, somewhat, differently, from, those, of, other, mammals, and, the, jaw, opening, muscle, is, different, as, in, all, true, mammals, the, tiny, bones, that, conduct, sound, to, the, inner, ear, are, fully, incorporated, into, the, skull, rather, than, lying, in, the, jaw, as, in, non, mammal, cynodonts, and, other, premammalian, synapsids, this, feature, too, is, now, claimed, to, have, evolved, independently, in, monotremes, and, therians, although, as, with, the, analogous, evolution, of, the, tribosphenic, molar, this, hypothesis, is, disputed, nonetheless, findings, on, the, extinct, species, teinolophos, confirm, that, suspended, ear, bones, evolved, independently, among, monotremes, and, therians, the, external, opening, of, the, ear, still, lies, at, the, base, of, the, jaw, the, sequencing, of, the, platypus, genome, has, also, provided, insight, into, the, evolution, of, a, number, of, monotreme, traits, such, as, venom, and, electroreception, as, well, as, showing, some, new, unique, features, such, as, monotremes, possessing, 5, pairs, of, sex, chromosomes, and, that, one, of, the, x, chromosomes, resembles, the, z, chromosome, of, birds, suggesting, that, the, two, sex, chromosomes, of, marsupial, and, placental, mammals, evolved, after, the, split, from, the, monotreme, lineage, additional, reconstruction, through, shared, genes, in, sex, chromosomes, supports, this, hypothesis, of, independent, evolution, this, feature, along, with, some, other, genetic, similarities, with, birds, such, as, shared, genes, related, to, egg, laying, is, thought, to, provide, some, insight, into, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, the, synapsid, lineage, leading, to, mammals, and, the, sauropsid, lineage, leading, to, birds, and, modern, reptiles, which, are, believed, to, have, split, about, 315, million, years, ago, during, the, carboniferous, the, presence, of, vitellogenin, genes, a, protein, necessary, for, egg, yolk, formation, is, shared, with, birds, the, presence, of, this, symplesiomorphy, suggests, that, the, common, ancestor, of, monotremes, marsupials, and, placental, mammals, was, oviparous, and, that, this, trait, was, retained, in, monotremes, but, lost, in, all, other, extant, mammal, groups, dna, analyses, suggest, that, although, this, trait, is, shared, and, is, synapomorphic, with, birds, platypuses, are, still, mammals, and, that, the, common, ancestor, of, extant, mammals, lactated, the, monotremes, also, have, extra, bones, in, the, shoulder, girdle, including, an, interclavicle, and, coracoid, which, are, not, found, in, other, mammals, monotremes, retain, a, reptile, like, gait, with, legs, on, the, sides, of, rather, than, underneath, their, bodies, the, monotreme, leg, bears, a, spur, in, the, ankle, region, the, spur, is, not, functional, in, echidnas, but, contains, a, powerful, venom, in, the, male, platypus, this, venom, is, derived, from, defensins, proteins, that, are, present, in, mammals, that, create, holes, in, viral, and, bacterial, pathogens, some, reptile, venom, is, also, composed, of, different, types, of, defensins, another, trait, shared, with, reptiles, it, is, thought, to, be, an, ancient, mammalian, characteristic, as, many, non, monotreme, archaic, mammal, groups, also, possess, venomous, spurs, the, key, anatomical, difference, between, monotremes, and, other, mammals, gives, them, their, name, monotreme, means, single, opening, in, greek, referring, to, the, single, duct, the, cloaca, for, their, urinary, defecatory, and, reproductive, systems, like, reptiles, monotremes, have, a, single, cloaca, marsupials, have, a, separate, genital, tract, whereas, most, placental, mammalian, females, have, separate, openings, for, reproduction, the, vagina, urination, the, urethra, and, defecation, the, anus, in, monotremes, only, semen, passes, through, the, penis, while, urine, is, excreted, through, the, male, s, cloaca, the, monotreme, penis, is, similar, to, that, of, turtles, and, is, covered, by, a, preputial, sac, monotreme, eggs, are, retained, for, some, time, within, the, mother, and, receive, nutrients, directly, from, her, generally, hatching, within, 10, days, after, being, laid, much, shorter, than, the, incubation, period, of, sauropsid, eggs, much, like, newborn, marsupials, and, perhaps, all, non, placental, mammals, newborn, monotremes, called, puggles, are, larval, and, fetus, like, and, have, relatively, well, developed, forelimbs, that, enable, them, to, crawl, around, monotremes, lack, teats, so, puggles, crawl, about, more, frequently, than, marsupial, joeys, in, search, of, milk, this, difference, raises, questions, about, the, supposed, developmental, restrictions, on, marsupial, forelimbs, rather, than, through, teats, monotremes, lactate, from, their, mammary, glands, via, openings, in, their, skin, all, five, extant, species, show, prolonged, parental, care, of, their, young, with, low, rates, of, reproduction, and, relatively, long, life, spans, monotremes, are, also, noteworthy, in, their, zygotic, development, most, mammalian, zygotes, go, through, holoblastic, cleavage, where, the, ovum, splits, into, multiple, divisible, daughter, cells, in, contrast, monotreme, zygotes, like, those, of, birds, and, reptiles, undergo, meroblastic, partial, division, this, means, that, the, cells, at, the, yolk, s, edge, have, cytoplasm, continuous, with, that, of, the, egg, allowing, the, yolk, and, embryo, to, exchange, waste, and, nutrients, with, the, surrounding, cytoplasm, monotremes, metabolic, rate, is, remarkably, low, by, mammalian, standards, the, platypus, has, an, average, body, temperature, of, about, 31, c, 88, f, rather, than, the, averages, of, 35, c, 95, f, for, marsupials, and, 37, c, 99, f, for, placental, mammals, research, suggests, this, has, been, a, gradual, adaptation, to, the, harsh, marginal, environmental, niches, in, which, the, few, extant, monotreme, species, have, managed, to, survive, rather, than, a, general, characteristic, of, extinct, monotremes, monotremes, may, have, less, developed, thermoregulation, than, other, mammals, but, recent, research, shows, that, they, easily, maintain, a, constant, body, temperature, in, a, variety, of, circumstances, such, as, the, platypus, in, icy, mountain, streams, early, researchers, were, misled, by, two, factors, firstly, monotremes, maintain, a, lower, average, temperature, than, most, mammals, secondly, the, short, beaked, echidna, much, easier, to, study, than, the, reclusive, platypus, maintains, normal, temperature, only, when, active, during, cold, weather, it, conserves, energy, by, switching, off, its, temperature, regulation, understanding, of, this, mechanism, came, when, reduced, thermal, regulation, was, observed, in, the, hyraxes, which, are, placental, mammals, the, echidna, was, originally, thought, to, experience, no, rapid, eye, movement, sleep, however, a, more, recent, study, showed, that, rem, sleep, accounted, for, about, 15, of, sleep, time, observed, on, subjects, at, an, environmental, temperature, of, 25, c, 77, f, surveying, a, range, of, environmental, temperatures, the, study, observed, very, little, rem, at, reduced, temperatures, of, 15, c, 59, f, and, 20, c, 68, f, and, also, a, substantial, reduction, at, the, elevated, temperature, of, 28, c, 82, f, monotreme, milk, contains, a, highly, expressed, antibacterial, protein, not, found, in, other, mammals, perhaps, to, compensate, for, the, more, septic, manner, of, milk, intake, associated, with, the, absence, of, teats, during, the, course, of, evolution, the, monotremes, have, lost, the, gastric, glands, normally, found, in, mammalian, stomachs, as, an, adaptation, to, their, diet, monotremes, synthesize, l, ascorbic, acid, only, in, the, kidneys, both, the, platypus, and, echidna, species, have, spurs, on, their, hind, limbs, the, echidna, spurs, are, vestigial, and, have, no, known, function, while, the, platypus, spurs, contain, venom, molecular, data, show, that, the, main, component, of, platypus, venom, emerged, before, the, divergence, of, platypus, and, echidnas, suggesting, that, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, these, taxa, was, also, possibly, a, venomous, monotreme, the, traditional, theria, hypothesis, states, that, the, divergence, of, the, monotreme, lineage, from, the, metatheria, marsupial, and, eutheria, placental, lineages, happened, prior, to, the, divergence, between, marsupials, and, placental, mammals, and, this, explains, why, monotremes, retain, a, number, of, primitive, traits, presumed, to, have, been, present, in, the, synapsid, ancestors, of, later, mammals, such, as, egg, laying, most, morphological, evidence, supports, the, theria, hypothesis, but, one, possible, exception, is, a, similar, pattern, of, tooth, replacement, seen, in, monotremes, and, marsupials, which, originally, provided, the, basis, for, the, competing, marsupionta, hypothesis, in, which, the, divergence, between, monotremes, and, marsupials, happened, later, than, the, divergence, between, these, lineages, and, the, placental, mammals, van, rheede, 2005, concluded, that, the, genetic, evidence, favors, the, theria, hypothesis, and, this, hypothesis, continues, to, be, the, more, widely, accepted, one, monotremes, are, conventionally, treated, as, comprising, a, single, order, monotremata, the, entire, grouping, is, also, traditionally, placed, into, a, subclass, prototheria, which, was, extended, to, include, several, fossil, orders, but, these, are, no, longer, seen, as, constituting, a, group, allied, to, monotreme, ancestry, a, controversial, hypothesis, now, relates, the, monotremes, to, a, different, assemblage, of, fossil, mammals, in, a, clade, termed, australosphenida, a, group, of, mammals, from, the, jurassic, and, cretaceous, of, madagascar, south, america, and, australia, that, share, tribosphenic, molars, however, in, a, 2022, review, of, monotreme, evolution, it, was, noted, that, teinolophos, the, oldest, barremian, 125, million, years, ago, and, the, most, primitive, monotreme, differed, substantially, from, non, monotreme, australosphenidans, in, having, five, molars, as, opposed, to, the, three, present, in, non, monotreme, australosphenidians, aptian, and, cenomanian, monotremes, of, the, family, kollikodontidae, 113, 96, 6, ma, have, four, molars, this, suggests, that, the, monotremes, are, likely, to, be, unrelated, to, the, australosphenidan, tribosphenids, the, time, when, the, monotreme, line, diverged, from, other, mammalian, lines, is, uncertain, but, one, survey, of, genetic, studies, gives, an, estimate, of, about, 220, million, years, ago, while, others, have, posited, younger, estimates, of, 163, to, 186, million, years, ago, though, the, already, eutherian, juramaia, is, dated, to, 161, 160, million, years, ago, teinolophos, like, modern, monotremes, displays, adaptations, to, elongation, and, increased, sensory, perception, in, the, jaws, related, to, mechanoreception, or, electroreception, molecular, clock, and, fossil, dating, give, a, wide, range, of, dates, for, the, split, between, echidnas, and, platypuses, with, one, survey, putting, the, split, at, 19, 48, million, years, ago, but, another, putting, it, at, 17, 89, million, years, ago, it, has, been, suggested, that, both, the, short, beaked, and, long, beaked, echidna, species, are, derived, from, a, platypus, like, ancestor, the, precise, relationships, among, extinct, groups, of, mammals, and, modern, groups, such, as, monotremes, are, uncertain, but, cladistic, analyses, usually, put, the, last, common, ancestor, lca, of, placentals, and, monotremes, close, to, the, lca, of, placentals, and, multituberculates, whereas, some, suggest, that, the, lca, of, placentals, and, multituberculates, was, more, recent, than, the, lca, of, placentals, and, monotremes, ornithorhynchus, anatinus, tachyglossus, aculeatus, z, bartoni, z, attenboroughi, z, bruijnii, ornithorhynchus, anatinus, tachyglossus, aculeatus, zaglossus, bruijnii, the, first, mesozoic, monotreme, to, be, discovered, was, the, cenomanian, 100, 96, 6, ma, steropodon, galmani, from, lightning, ridge, new, south, wales, biochemical, and, anatomical, evidence, suggests, that, the, monotremes, diverged, from, the, mammalian, lineage, before, the, marsupials, and, placental, mammals, arose, the, only, mesozoic, monotremes, are, teinolophos, barremian, 126, ma, sundrius, and, kryoryctes, albian, 113, 108, ma, and, dharragarra, kollikodon, opalios, parvopalus, steropodon, and, stirtodon, all, cenomanian, 100, 2, 96, 6, ma, from, australian, deposits, and, patagorhynchus, maastrichtian, from, patagonian, deposits, in, the, cretaceous, indicating, that, monotremes, were, diversifiying, by, the, early, late, cretaceous, monotremes, have, been, found, in, the, latest, cretaceous, and, paleocene, of, southern, south, america, so, one, hypothesis, is, that, monotremes, arose, in, australia, in, the, late, jurassic, or, early, cretaceous, and, that, some, migrated, across, antarctica, to, south, america, both, of, which, were, still, united, with, australia, at, that, time, this, direction, of, migration, is, the, opposite, of, that, hypothesized, for, australia, s, other, dominant, mammal, group, the, marsupials, which, likely, migrated, across, antarctica, to, australia, from, south, america, in, 2024, a, prominent, assemblage, of, early, monotremes, was, described, from, the, cenomanian, deposits, 100, 96, 6, ma, of, the, griman, creek, formation, in, lightning, ridge, new, south, wales, one, of, these, the, fossil, jaw, fragment, of, dharragarra, is, the, oldest, known, platypus, like, fossil, the, durophagous, kollikodon, the, pseudotribosphenic, steropodon, and, stirtodon, dharragarra, opalios, and, parvopalus, occur, in, the, same, cenomanian, deposits, oligo, miocene, fossils, of, the, toothed, platypus, obdurodon, have, also, been, recovered, from, australia, and, fossils, of, a, 63, million, year, old, platypus, relative, occur, in, southern, argentina, monotrematum, see, fossil, monotremes, below, the, extant, platypus, genus, ornithorhynchus, in, also, known, from, pliocene, deposits, and, the, oldest, fossil, tachyglossids, are, pleistocene, 1, 7, ma, in, age, excepting, ornithorhynchus, anatinus, all, the, animals, listed, in, this, section, are, known, only, from, fossils, some, family, designations, are, hesitant, given, the, fragmentary, nature, of, the, specimens
