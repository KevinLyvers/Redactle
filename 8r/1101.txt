the, lentil, vicia, lens, or, lens, culinaris, is, an, edible, legume, it, is, an, annual, plant, known, for, its, lens, shaped, seeds, it, is, about, 40, cm, 16, in, tall, and, the, seeds, grow, in, pods, usually, with, two, seeds, in, each, lentils, are, used, around, the, world, for, culinary, purposes, in, cuisines, of, the, indian, subcontinent, where, lentils, are, a, staple, split, lentils, often, with, their, hulls, removed, known, as, dal, are, often, cooked, into, a, thick, curry, that, is, usually, eaten, with, rice, or, roti, lentils, are, commonly, used, in, stews, and, soups, many, different, names, in, different, parts, of, the, world, are, used, for, the, crop, lentil, the, first, use, of, the, word, lens, to, designate, a, specific, genus, was, in, the, 17th, century, by, the, botanist, tournefort, the, word, lens, for, the, lentil, is, of, classical, roman, or, latin, origin, possibly, from, a, prominent, roman, family, named, lentulus, just, as, the, family, name, cicero, was, derived, from, the, chickpea, cicer, arietinum, and, fabia, as, in, quintus, fabius, maximus, from, the, fava, bean, vicia, faba, the, genus, vicia, is, part, of, the, subfamily, faboideae, which, is, contained, in, the, flowering, plant, family, fabaceae, or, commonly, known, as, legume, or, bean, family, of, the, order, fabales, in, the, kingdom, plantae, the, former, genus, lens, consisted, of, the, cultivated, l, culinaris, and, six, related, wild, taxa, among, the, different, taxa, of, wild, lentils, l, orientalis, was, considered, to, be, the, progenitor, of, the, cultivated, lentil, and, was, generally, classified, as, l, culinaris, subsp, orientalis, lentil, is, hypogeal, which, means, the, cotyledons, of, the, germinating, seed, stay, in, the, ground, and, inside, the, seed, coat, therefore, it, is, less, vulnerable, to, frost, wind, erosion, or, insect, attack, the, plant, is, a, diploid, annual, bushy, herb, of, erect, semierect, or, spreading, and, compact, growth, and, normally, varies, from, 30, to, 50, centimetres, 12, to, 20, in, in, height, it, has, many, hairy, branches, and, its, stem, is, slender, and, angular, the, rachis, bears, 10, to, 15, leaflets, in, five, to, eight, pairs, the, leaves, are, alternate, of, oblong, linear, and, obtuse, shape, and, from, yellowish, green, to, dark, bluish, green, in, colour, in, general, the, upper, leaves, are, converted, into, tendrils, whereas, the, lower, leaves, are, mucronate, if, stipules, are, present, they, are, small, the, flowers, one, to, four, in, number, are, small, white, pink, purple, pale, purple, or, pale, blue, in, colour, they, arise, from, the, axils, of, the, leaves, on, a, slender, footstalk, almost, as, long, as, the, leaves, the, pods, are, oblong, slightly, inflated, and, about, 1, 5, centimetres, 5, 8, in, long, normally, each, of, them, contains, two, seeds, about, 0, 5, centimetres, 1, 4, in, in, diameter, in, the, characteristic, lens, shape, the, seeds, can, also, be, mottled, and, speckled, the, several, cultivated, varieties, of, lentil, differ, in, size, hairiness, and, colour, of, the, leaves, flowers, and, seeds, lentils, are, self, pollinating, the, flowering, begins, from, the, lowermost, buds, and, gradually, moves, upward, so, called, acropetal, flowering, about, two, weeks, are, needed, for, all, the, flowers, to, open, on, the, single, branch, at, the, end, of, the, second, day, and, on, the, third, day, after, the, opening, of, the, flowers, they, close, completely, and, the, colour, begins, to, fade, after, three, to, four, days, the, setting, of, the, pods, takes, place, types, can, be, classified, according, to, their, size, whether, they, are, split, or, whole, or, shelled, or, unshelled, seed, coats, can, range, from, light, green, to, deep, purple, as, well, as, being, tan, grey, brown, black, or, mottled, shelled, lentils, show, the, colour, of, the, cotyledon, which, can, be, yellow, orange, red, or, green, red, cotyledon, types, small, green, brown, seed, coat, types, medium, green, brown, seed, coat, types, large, green, brown, seed, coat, types, other, types, in, 2022, global, production, of, lentils, was, 6, 7, million, tonnes, canada, produced, the, largest, share, 2, 2, million, tonnes, or, roughly, 34, of, the, world, s, total, output, table, nearly, all, 95, of, it, in, saskatchewan, india, was, the, world, s, second, largest, producer, led, by, the, states, of, madhya, pradesh, and, uttar, pradesh, which, together, account, for, roughly, 70, percent, of, the, national, lentil, production, the, cultivated, lentil, lens, culinaris, subsp, culinaris, was, derived, from, its, wild, subspecies, l, culinaris, subsp, orientalis, although, other, species, may, also, have, contributed, some, genes, according, to, jonathan, sauer, historical, geography, of, crop, plants, 2017, unlike, their, wild, ancestors, domesticated, lentil, crops, have, indehiscent, pods, and, non, dormant, seeds, lentil, was, domesticated, in, the, fertile, crescent, of, the, near, east, and, then, spread, to, europe, the, middle, east, north, africa, and, the, indo, gangetic, plain, the, primary, center, of, diversity, for, the, domestic, lens, culinaris, as, well, as, its, wild, progenitor, l, culinaris, ssp, orientalis, is, considered, to, be, the, middle, east, the, oldest, known, carbonized, remains, of, lentil, from, greece, s, franchthi, cave, are, dated, to, 11, 000, bc, in, archaeobotanical, excavations, carbonized, remains, of, lentil, seeds, have, been, recovered, from, widely, dispersed, places, such, as, tell, ramad, in, syria, 6250, 5950, bc, aceramic, beidha, in, jordan, hacilar, in, turkey, 5800, 5000, bc, tepe, sabz, ita, tepe, sabz, in, iran, 5500, 5000, bc, and, argissa, magula, tessaly, in, greece, 6000, 5000, bc, along, other, places, lentils, can, grow, on, various, soil, types, from, sand, to, clay, loam, growing, best, in, deep, sandy, loam, soils, with, moderate, fertility, a, soil, ph, around, 7, would, be, the, best, lentils, do, not, tolerate, flooding, or, water, logged, conditions, lentils, improve, the, physical, properties, of, soils, and, increase, the, yield, of, succeeding, cereal, crops, biological, nitrogen, fixation, or, other, rotational, effects, could, be, the, reason, for, higher, yields, after, lentils, the, conditions, under, which, lentils, are, grown, differ, across, different, growing, regions, in, the, temperate, climates, lentils, are, planted, in, the, winter, and, spring, under, low, temperatures, and, vegetative, growth, occurs, in, later, spring, and, the, summer, rainfall, during, this, time, is, not, limited, in, the, subtropics, lentils, are, planted, under, relatively, high, temperatures, at, the, end, of, the, rainy, season, and, vegetative, growth, occurs, on, the, residual, soil, moisture, in, the, summer, season, rainfall, during, this, time, is, limited, in, west, asia, and, north, africa, some, lentils, are, planted, as, a, winter, crop, before, snowfall, plant, growth, occurs, during, the, time, of, snow, melting, under, such, cultivation, seed, yields, are, often, much, higher, the, lentil, requires, a, firm, smooth, seedbed, with, most, of, the, previous, crop, residues, incorporated, for, the, seed, placement, and, for, later, harvesting, it, is, important, that, the, surface, is, not, uneven, with, large, clods, stones, or, protruding, crop, residue, it, is, also, important, that, the, soil, be, made, friable, and, weed, free, so, that, seeding, can, be, done, at, a, uniform, depth, the, plant, densities, for, lentils, vary, between, genotypes, seed, size, planting, time, and, growing, conditions, and, also, from, region, to, region, in, south, asia, a, seed, rate, of, 30, to, 40, kilograms, per, hectare, 27, to, 36, pounds, per, acre, is, recommended, in, west, asian, countries, a, higher, seed, rate, is, recommended, and, also, leads, to, a, higher, yield, the, seeds, should, be, sown, 3, to, 4, centimetres, 1, 1, 4, to, 1, 1, 2, in, deep, in, agriculturally, mechanized, countries, lentils, are, planted, using, grain, drills, but, many, other, areas, still, hand, broadcast, in, intercropping, systems, a, practice, commonly, used, in, lentil, cultivation, herbicides, may, be, needed, to, assure, crop, health, like, many, other, legume, crops, lentils, can, fix, atmospheric, nitrogen, in, the, soil, with, specific, rhizobia, lentils, grow, well, under, low, fertilizer, input, conditions, although, phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, and, sulfur, may, be, used, for, nutrient, poor, soils, below, is, a, list, of, the, most, common, lentil, diseases, a, combination, of, gravity, screens, and, air, flow, is, used, to, clean, and, sort, lentils, by, shape, and, density, after, destoning, they, may, be, separated, by, a, color, sorter, and, then, packaged, a, major, part, of, the, world, s, red, lentil, production, undergoes, a, secondary, processing, step, these, lentils, are, dehulled, split, and, polished, in, the, indian, subcontinent, this, process, is, called, dal, milling, the, moisture, content, of, the, lentils, prior, to, dehulling, is, crucial, to, guarantee, a, good, dehulling, efficiency, the, hull, of, lentils, usually, accounts, for, 6, to, 7, percent, of, the, total, seed, weight, which, is, lower, than, most, legumes, lentil, flour, can, be, produced, by, milling, the, seeds, like, cereals, lentils, can, be, eaten, soaked, germinated, fried, baked, or, boiled, the, most, common, preparation, method, the, seeds, require, a, cooking, time, of, 10, to, 40, minutes, depending, on, the, variety, small, varieties, with, the, husk, removed, such, as, the, common, red, lentil, require, shorter, cooking, times, and, unlike, most, legumes, don, t, require, soaking, most, varieties, have, a, distinctive, earthy, flavor, lentils, with, husks, remain, whole, with, moderate, cooking, while, those, without, husks, tend, to, disintegrate, into, a, thick, pur, e, which, may, enable, various, dishes, the, composition, of, lentils, leads, to, a, high, emulsifying, capacity, which, can, be, even, increased, by, dough, fermentation, in, bread, making, lentils, are, used, worldwide, in, many, different, dishes, lentil, dishes, are, most, widespread, throughout, south, asia, the, mediterranean, regions, west, asia, and, latin, america, in, the, indian, subcontinent, fiji, mauritius, singapore, and, the, caribbean, lentil, curry, is, part, of, the, everyday, diet, eaten, with, both, rice, and, roti, boiled, lentils, and, lentil, stock, are, used, to, thicken, most, vegetarian, curries, they, are, also, used, as, stuffing, in, dal, parathas, and, puri, for, breakfast, or, snacks, lentils, are, also, used, in, many, regional, varieties, of, sweets, lentil, flour, is, used, to, prepare, several, different, bread, varieties, such, as, papadam, they, are, frequently, combined, with, rice, which, has, a, similar, cooking, time, a, lentil, and, rice, dish, is, referred, to, in, levantine, countries, as, mujaddara, or, mejadra, in, iran, rice, and, lentil, is, served, with, fried, raisin, this, dish, is, called, adas, polo, rice, and, lentils, are, also, cooked, together, in, khichdi, a, popular, dish, in, the, indian, subcontinent, india, and, pakistan, a, similar, dish, kushari, made, in, egypt, is, considered, one, of, two, national, dishes, lentils, are, used, to, prepare, an, inexpensive, and, nutritious, soup, throughout, europe, and, north, and, south, america, sometimes, combined, with, chicken, or, pork, in, western, countries, cooked, lentils, are, often, used, in, salads, in, italy, the, traditional, dish, for, new, year, s, eve, is, cotechino, served, with, lentils, lentils, are, commonly, eaten, in, ethiopia, in, a, stew, like, dish, called, kik, or, kik, wot, one, of, the, dishes, people, eat, with, ethiopia, s, national, food, injera, flatbread, yellow, lentils, are, used, to, make, a, non, spicy, stew, which, is, one, of, the, first, solid, foods, ethiopians, feed, their, babies, lentils, were, a, chief, part, of, the, diet, of, ancient, iranians, who, consumed, lentils, daily, in, the, form, of, a, stew, poured, over, rice, boiled, lentils, are, 70, water, 20, carbohydrates, 9, protein, and, 0, 4, fat, table, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, grams, 3, 1, 2, ounces, cooked, lentils, boiled, variety, unspecified, provide, 114, calories, and, are, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, folate, 45, dv, iron, 25, dv, manganese, 24, dv, and, phosphorus, 26, dv, they, are, a, good, source, 10, dv, of, thiamine, 15, dv, pantothenic, acid, 13, dv, vitamin, b, 6, 14, dv, magnesium, 10, dv, copper, 13, dv, and, zinc, 13, table, lentils, contain, carotenoids, lutein, and, zeaxanthin, and, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, the, low, levels, of, readily, digestible, starch, 5, percent, and, high, levels, of, slowly, digested, starch, make, lentils, of, potential, value, to, people, with, diabetes, the, remaining, 65, of, the, starch, is, a, resistant, starch, classified, as, rs1, a, minimum, of, 10, in, starch, from, lentils, escapes, digestion, and, absorption, in, the, small, intestine, therefore, called, resistant, starch, additional, resistant, starch, is, synthesized, from, gelatinized, starch, during, cooling, after, lentils, are, cooked, lentils, also, have, antinutrient, factors, such, as, trypsin, inhibitors, and, a, relatively, high, phytate, content, trypsin, is, an, enzyme, involved, in, digestion, and, phytates, reduce, the, bioavailability, of, dietary, minerals, the, phytates, can, be, reduced, by, prolonged, soaking, and, fermentation, or, sprouting, cooking, nearly, completely, removes, the, trypsin, inhibitor, activity, sprouting, is, also, effective, although, lentils, have, been, an, important, crop, for, centuries, lentil, breeding, and, genetic, research, have, a, relatively, short, history, compared, to, that, of, many, other, crops, since, the, inception, of, the, international, center, for, agriculture, research, in, the, dry, areas, icarda, breeding, programme, in, 1977, significant, gains, have, been, made, it, supplies, landraces, and, breeding, lines, for, countries, around, the, world, supplemented, by, other, programmes, in, both, developing, e, g, india, and, developed, e, g, australia, and, canada, countries, in, recent, years, such, collaborations, among, breeders, and, agronomists, are, becoming, increasingly, important, the, focus, lies, on, high, yielding, and, stable, cultivars, for, diverse, environments, to, match, the, demand, of, a, growing, population, in, particular, progress, in, quantity, and, quality, as, well, as, in, the, resistance, to, disease, and, abiotic, stresses, are, the, major, breeding, aims, several, varieties, have, been, developed, applying, conventional, breeding, methodologies, serious, genetic, improvement, for, yield, has, been, made, however, the, full, potential, of, production, and, productivity, could, not, yet, be, tapped, due, to, several, biotic, and, abiotic, stresses, wild, lens, species, are, a, significant, source, of, genetic, variation, for, improving, the, relatively, narrow, genetic, base, of, this, crop, the, wild, species, possess, many, diverse, traits, including, disease, resistances, and, abiotic, stress, tolerances, the, above, mentioned, l, nigricans, and, l, orientalis, possess, morphological, similarities, to, the, cultivated, l, culinaris, but, only, l, culinaris, and, l, culinaris, subsp, orientalis, are, crossable, and, produce, fully, fertile, seed, between, the, different, related, species, hybridisation, barriers, exist, according, to, their, inter, crossability, lens, species, can, be, divided, into, three, gene, pools, crosses, generally, fail, between, members, of, different, gene, pools, however, plant, growth, regulators, and, or, embryo, rescue, allows, the, growth, of, viable, hybrids, between, groups, even, if, crosses, are, successful, many, undesired, genes, may, be, introduced, as, well, in, addition, to, the, desired, ones, this, can, be, resolved, by, using, a, backcrossing, programme, thus, mutagenesis, is, crucial, to, create, new, and, desirable, varieties, according, to, yadav, et, al, other, biotechnology, techniques, which, may, impact, on, lentil, breeding, are, micro, propagation, using, meristamatic, explants, callus, culture, and, regeneration, protoplast, culture, and, doubled, haploid, production, there, is, a, proposed, revision, of, the, gene, pools, using, snp, phylogeny
