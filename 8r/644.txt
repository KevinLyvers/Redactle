phasianus, phasis, the, common, pheasant, phasianus, colchicus, is, a, bird, in, the, pheasant, family, phasianidae, the, genus, name, comes, from, latin, phasianus, pheasant, the, species, name, colchicus, is, latin, for, of, colchis, modern, day, georgia, a, country, on, the, black, sea, where, pheasants, became, known, to, europeans, although, phasianus, was, previously, thought, to, be, closely, related, to, the, genus, gallus, the, genus, of, junglefowl, and, domesticated, chickens, recent, studies, show, that, they, are, in, different, subfamilies, having, diverged, over, 20, million, years, ago, it, is, native, to, asia, and, parts, of, europe, like, the, northern, foothills, of, the, caucasus, and, the, balkans, it, has, been, widely, introduced, elsewhere, as, a, game, bird, in, parts, of, its, range, namely, in, places, where, none, of, its, relatives, occur, such, as, in, europe, where, it, is, naturalised, it, is, simply, known, as, the, pheasant, ring, necked, pheasant, is, both, the, name, used, for, the, species, as, a, whole, in, north, america, and, also, the, collective, name, for, a, number, of, subspecies, and, their, intergrades, that, have, white, neck, rings, it, is, a, well, known, gamebird, among, those, of, more, than, regional, importance, perhaps, the, most, widespread, and, ancient, one, in, the, whole, world, the, common, pheasant, is, one, of, the, world, s, most, hunted, birds, it, has, been, introduced, for, that, purpose, to, many, regions, and, is, also, common, on, game, farms, where, it, is, commercially, bred, ring, necked, pheasants, in, particular, are, commonly, bred, and, were, introduced, to, many, parts, of, the, world, the, game, farm, stock, though, no, distinct, breeds, have, been, developed, yet, can, be, considered, semi, domesticated, the, ring, necked, pheasant, is, the, state, bird, of, south, dakota, one, of, only, two, us, state, birds, that, is, not, a, species, native, to, the, united, states, the, green, pheasant, p, versicolor, of, japan, is, sometimes, considered, a, subspecies, of, the, common, pheasant, though, the, species, produce, fertile, hybrids, wherever, they, coexist, this, is, simply, a, typical, feature, among, fowl, galloanseres, in, which, postzygotic, isolating, mechanisms, are, slight, compared, to, most, other, birds, the, species, apparently, have, somewhat, different, ecological, requirements, and, at, least, in, its, typical, habitat, the, green, pheasant, outcompetes, the, common, pheasant, the, introduction, of, the, latter, to, japan, has, therefore, largely, failed, there, are, many, colour, forms, of, the, male, common, pheasant, ranging, in, colour, from, nearly, white, to, almost, black, in, some, melanistic, examples, these, are, due, to, captive, breeding, and, hybridisation, between, subspecies, and, with, the, green, pheasant, reinforced, by, continual, releases, of, stock, from, varying, sources, to, the, wild, for, example, the, ring, necked, pheasants, common, in, europe, north, america, and, australia, do, not, pertain, to, any, specific, taxon, they, rather, represent, a, stereotyped, hybrid, swarm, body, weight, can, range, from, 0, 5, to, 3, kg, 1, to, 7, lb, with, males, averaging, 1, 2, kg, 2, lb, 10, oz, and, females, averaging, 0, 9, kg, 2, lb, 0, oz, wingspan, ranges, from, 56, 86, cm, 22, 34, in, the, adult, male, common, pheasant, of, the, nominate, subspecies, phasianus, colchicus, colchicus, is, 60, 89, cm, 23, 1, 2, 35, in, in, length, with, a, long, brown, streaked, black, tail, accounting, for, almost, 50, cm, 20, in, of, the, total, length, the, body, plumage, is, barred, bright, gold, or, fiery, copper, red, and, chestnut, brown, plumage, with, iridescent, sheen, of, green, and, purple, but, rump, uniform, is, sometimes, blue, the, wing, coverage, is, white, or, cream, and, black, barred, markings, are, common, on, the, tail, the, head, is, bottle, green, with, a, small, crest, and, distinctive, red, wattle, p, c, colchicus, and, some, other, races, lack, a, white, neck, ring, behind, the, face, are, two, ear, tufts, that, make, the, pheasant, more, alert, the, female, hen, and, juveniles, are, much, less, showy, with, a, duller, mottled, brown, plumage, all, over, and, measuring, 50, 63, cm, 19, 1, 2, 25, in, long, including, a, tail, of, around, 20, cm, 8, in, juvenile, birds, have, the, appearance, of, the, female, with, a, shorter, tail, until, young, males, begin, to, grow, characteristic, bright, feathers, on, the, breast, head, and, back, at, about, 10, weeks, after, hatching, the, green, pheasant, p, versicolor, is, very, similar, and, hybridisation, often, makes, the, identity, of, individual, birds, difficult, to, determine, green, pheasant, males, on, average, have, a, shorter, tail, than, the, common, pheasant, and, have, darker, plumage, that, is, uniformly, bottle, green, on, the, breast, and, belly, they, always, lack, a, neck, ring, green, pheasant, females, are, darker, with, many, black, dots, on, the, breast, and, belly, in, addition, various, colour, mutations, are, commonly, encountered, mainly, melanistic, black, and, flavistic, isabelline, or, fawn, specimens, the, former, are, rather, common, in, some, areas, and, are, named, tenebrosus, pheasant, p, colchicus, var, tenebrosus, this, species, was, first, scientifically, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, landmark, 1758, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, under, its, current, scientific, name, the, common, pheasant, is, distinct, enough, from, any, other, species, known, to, linnaeus, for, a, laconic, rufus, cap, te, caeruleo, a, red, pheasant, with, blue, head, to, serve, as, entirely, sufficient, description, moreover, the, bird, had, been, extensively, discussed, before, linnaeus, established, binomial, nomenclature, his, sources, are, the, ornithologia, of, ulisse, aldrovandi, giovanni, pietro, olina, s, uccelliera, john, ray, s, synopsis, methodica, avium, piscium, and, a, natural, history, of, the, birds, by, eleazar, albin, therein, essentially, the, bulk, of, the, ornithology, textbooks, of, his, day, the, species, is, simply, named, the, pheasant, in, the, books, respective, languages, whereas, in, other, species, such, as, the, eastern, meadowlark, sturnella, magna, linnaeus, felt, it, warranted, to, cite, plumage, details, from, his, sources, in, the, common, pheasant, s, case, he, simply, referred, to, the, reason, of, the, bird, s, fame, principum, mensis, dicatur, the, type, locality, is, given, simply, as, africa, asia, however, the, bird, does, not, occur, in, africa, except, perhaps, in, linnaeus, s, time, in, mediterranean, coastal, areas, where, they, might, have, been, introduced, during, the, roman, empire, the, type, locality, was, later, fixed, to, the, rioni, river, in, western, georgia, known, as, phasis, to, the, ancient, greeks, these, birds, until, the, modern, era, constituted, the, bulk, of, the, introduced, stock, in, parts, of, europe, that, was, not, already, present, the, birds, described, by, linnaeus, s, sources, though, typically, belonging, to, such, early, introductions, would, certainly, have, more, alleles, in, common, with, the, transcaucasian, population, than, with, others, the, scientific, name, is, latin, for, pheasant, from, colchis, colchicus, referring, to, the, west, of, modern, day, georgia, the, ancient, greek, term, corresponding, to, the, english, pheasant, is, phasianos, ornis, bird, of, the, river, phasis, although, linnaeus, included, many, galliformes, in, his, genus, phasianius, such, as, the, domestic, chicken, and, its, wild, ancestor, the, red, junglefowl, nowadays, gallus, gallus, today, only, the, common, and, the, green, pheasant, are, placed, in, this, genus, as, the, latter, was, not, known, to, linnaeus, in, 1758, the, common, pheasant, is, naturally, the, type, species, of, phasianus, in, the, us, common, pheasants, are, widely, known, as, ring, necked, pheasants, more, colloquial, north, american, names, include, chinks, or, in, montana, phezzens, in, china, meanwhile, the, species, is, properly, called, zhi, ji, pheasant, fowl, essentially, implying, the, same, as, the, english, name, common, pheasant, like, elsewhere, p, colchicus, is, such, a, familiar, bird, in, china, that, it, is, usually, just, referred, to, as, shan, ji, mountain, chicken, a, chinese, term, for, pheasants, in, general, as, of, 2005, it, had, the, smallest, known, genome, of, all, living, amniotes, only, 0, 97, pg, 970, million, base, pairs, roughly, one, third, of, the, human, genome, s, size, however, the, black, chinned, hummingbird, is, now, currently, held, to, have, the, smallest, there, are, about, 30, subspecies, in, five, to, eight, groups, these, can, be, identified, by, the, male, plumage, namely, presence, or, absence, of, a, white, neck, ring, and, or, a, white, superciliary, stripe, the, colour, of, the, uppertail, rump, and, wing, coverts, and, the, colour, of, crown, chest, upper, back, and, flank, feathers, as, noted, above, introduced, populations, have, mixed, the, alleles, of, various, races, by, various, amounts, differing, according, to, the, original, stock, used, for, introductions, and, what, natural, selection, according, to, climate, and, habitat, has, made, of, that, an, investigation, into, the, genetic, relationships, of, subspecies, revealed, that, the, earliest, subspecies, is, likely, to, have, been, elegans, suggesting, that, the, common, pheasant, originated, from, the, forests, of, southeastern, china, initial, divergence, is, thought, to, have, occurred, around, 3, 4, mya, the, lack, of, agreement, between, morphology, based, subspecies, delimitation, and, their, genetic, relationships, is, thought, to, be, attributed, to, past, isolation, followed, by, more, recent, population, mixing, as, the, pheasant, has, expanded, its, range, across, the, western, palaearctic, sometimes, this, species, is, split, into, the, central, asian, common, and, the, east, asian, ring, necked, pheasants, roughly, separated, by, the, arid, and, high, mountainous, regions, of, turkestan, however, while, the, western, and, eastern, populations, probably, were, entirely, separate, during, the, zyryanka, glaciation, when, deserts, were, more, extensive, this, separation, was, not, long, enough, for, actual, speciation, to, occur, today, the, largest, variety, of, colour, patterns, is, found, where, the, western, and, eastern, populations, mix, as, is, to, be, expected, females, usually, cannot, be, identified, even, to, subspecies, group, with, certainty, many, subspecies, are, in, danger, of, disappearing, due, to, hybridisation, with, introduced, birds, the, last, indigenous, black, necked, pheasant, p, c, colchicus, population, in, europe, survives, in, greece, in, the, delta, of, the, river, nestos, where, in, 2012, the, population, was, estimated, 100, 250, individuals, the, subspecies, groups, going, from, west, to, east, and, some, notable, subspecies, are, within, a, maximum, clade, credibility, mdna, gene, tree, the, most, basal, group, is, the, elegans, group, of, the, eastern, clade, diverging, from, the, green, pheasant, during, the, calabrian, and, diversifying, in, middle, pleistocene, around, 0, 7, million, years, ago, with, the, groups, of, the, western, clade, splitting, off, from, those, of, the, eastern, clade, about, 0, 59, million, years, ago, while, the, subspecies, of, the, western, clade, are, well, geographically, separated, from, each, other, the, subspecies, of, the, eastern, clade, often, show, clinal, variation, and, large, areas, of, intergradation, for, example, clines, connect, pallasi, karpowi, torquatus, takatsukasae, within, the, torquatus, group, and, kiangsuensis, alaschanicus, sohokhotensis, strauchi, within, the, strauchi, vlangalii, group, with, the, degree, of, expression, of, white, collar, and, superciliary, stripe, in, both, cases, decreasing, from, north, to, south, the, isolated, form, hagenbecki, is, very, close, to, pallasi, in, phenotype, and, has, been, traditionally, treated, within, the, torquatus, group, until, recently, when, it, was, assigned, in, one, study, to, the, strauchi, vlangalii, group, however, the, origin, of, the, corresponding, feather, samples, as, listed, in, genbank, is, far, away, from, the, known, distribution, of, subspecies, hagenbecki, and, the, issue, needs, further, clarification, common, pheasants, are, native, to, asia, and, parts, of, europe, their, original, range, extending, from, the, balkans, where, the, last, truly, wild, birds, survive, around, nestos, river, in, greece, the, black, and, caspian, seas, to, manchuria, siberia, korea, mainland, china, and, taiwan, the, birds, are, found, in, woodland, farmland, scrub, and, wetlands, in, its, natural, habitat, the, common, pheasant, lives, in, grassland, near, water, with, small, copses, of, trees, extensively, cleared, farmland, is, marginal, habitat, that, cannot, maintain, self, sustaining, populations, for, long, common, pheasants, are, gregarious, birds, and, outside, the, breeding, season, form, loose, flocks, however, captive, bred, common, pheasants, can, show, strong, sexual, segregation, in, space, and, time, with, sex, differences, in, the, use, of, feeding, stations, throughout, the, day, wherever, they, are, hunted, they, are, always, timid, once, they, associate, humans, with, danger, and, will, quickly, retreat, for, safety, after, hearing, the, arrival, of, hunting, parties, in, the, area, while, common, pheasants, are, able, short, distance, fliers, they, prefer, to, run, if, startled, however, they, can, suddenly, burst, upwards, at, great, speed, with, a, distinctive, whirring, wing, sound, and, often, giving, kok, kok, kok, calls, to, alert, conspecifics, their, flight, speed, is, only, 43, 61, km, h, 23, 33, kn, when, cruising, but, when, chased, they, can, fly, up, to, 90, km, h, 49, kn, common, pheasants, nest, solely, on, the, ground, in, scrapes, lined, with, some, grass, and, leaves, frequently, under, dense, cover, or, a, hedge, occasionally, they, will, nest, in, a, haystack, or, old, nest, left, by, other, bird, they, roost, in, sheltered, trees, at, night, the, males, are, polygynous, as, is, typical, for, many, phasianidae, and, are, often, accompanied, by, a, harem, of, several, females, common, pheasants, produce, a, clutch, of, around, 8, 15, eggs, sometimes, as, many, as, 18, but, usually, 10, to, 12, they, are, pale, olive, in, colour, and, laid, over, a, 2, 3, week, period, in, april, to, june, the, incubation, period, is, about, 22, 27, days, the, chicks, stay, near, the, hen, for, several, weeks, yet, leave, the, nest, when, only, a, few, hours, old, after, hatching, they, grow, quickly, flying, after, 12, 14, days, resembling, adults, by, only, 15, weeks, of, age, they, eat, a, wide, variety, of, animal, and, vegetable, type, food, like, fruit, seeds, grain, mast, berries, and, leaves, as, well, as, a, wide, range, of, invertebrates, such, as, leatherjackets, ant, eggs, wireworms, caterpillars, grasshoppers, and, other, insects, with, small, vertebrates, like, lizards, field, voles, small, mammals, and, small, birds, occasionally, taken, southern, caucasian, pheasants, p, c, colchicus, were, common, in, greece, during, the, classical, period, and, it, is, a, widespread, myth, that, the, greeks, took, pheasants, to, the, balkans, when, they, colonised, colchis, in, the, caucasus, this, colonization, happened, during, the, 6th, century, bc, but, pheasant, archaeological, remains, in, the, balkans, are, much, older, dating, to, 6th, millennium, bc, this, fact, indicates, that, probably, pheasants, reached, the, area, naturally, additionally, it, seems, that, they, had, a, continuous, range, in, turkey, from, the, sea, of, marmara, on, the, edge, of, the, balkans, across, the, northern, shore, of, the, country, till, caucasus, the, last, remnants, of, the, balkan, population, survive, in, the, kotza, orman, riparian, forest, of, nestos, in, greece, with, an, estimated, population, of, 100, 200, adult, birds, in, bulgaria, they, were, lost, in, the, 1970s, because, they, hybridised, with, introduced, eastern, subspecies, besides, the, balkans, the, species, lives, in, europe, in, the, area, north, of, caucasus, where, the, local, subspecies, p, c, septentrionalis, survives, pure, around, the, lower, reaches, of, the, samur, river, reintroduction, efforts, in, the, rest, of, the, north, caucasian, range, may, include, hybrid, birds, common, pheasants, can, now, be, found, across, the, globe, due, to, their, readiness, to, breed, in, captivity, and, the, fact, they, can, naturalise, in, many, climates, but, were, known, to, be, introduced, in, europe, north, america, japan, and, new, zealand, pheasants, were, hunted, in, their, natural, range, by, stone, age, humans, just, like, the, grouse, partridges, junglefowls, and, perhaps, peafowls, that, inhabited, europe, at, that, time, at, least, since, the, roman, empire, the, bird, was, extensively, introduced, in, many, places, and, has, become, a, naturalized, member, at, least, of, the, european, fauna, introductions, in, the, southern, hemisphere, have, mostly, failed, except, where, local, galliformes, or, their, ecological, equivalents, are, rare, or, absent, the, bird, was, naturalized, in, great, britain, around, ad, 1059, but, may, have, been, introduced, by, the, romano, british, centuries, earlier, it, was, the, caucasian, subspecies, mistakenly, known, as, the, old, english, pheasant, rather, than, the, chinese, ring, necked, pheasants, torquatus, that, were, introduced, to, britain, but, it, became, extirpated, from, most, of, the, isles, in, the, early, 17th, century, there, were, further, re, introductions, of, the, white, neck, ringed, variety, in, the, 18th, century, it, was, rediscovered, as, a, game, bird, in, the, 1830s, after, being, ignored, for, many, years, in, an, amalgam, of, forms, since, then, it, has, been, reared, extensively, by, gamekeepers, and, was, shot, in, season, from, 1, october, to, 31, january, pheasants, are, well, adapted, to, the, british, climate, and, breed, naturally, in, the, wild, without, human, supervision, in, copses, heaths, and, commons, by, 1950, pheasants, bred, throughout, the, british, isles, although, they, were, scarce, in, ireland, because, around, 30, 000, 000, pheasants, are, released, each, year, on, shooting, estates, mainly, in, the, midlands, and, south, of, england, it, is, widespread, in, distribution, although, most, released, birds, survive, less, than, a, year, in, the, wild, the, bohemian, was, most, likely, seen, in, north, norfolk, the, game, wildlife, conservation, trust, is, researching, the, breeding, success, of, reared, pheasants, and, trying, to, find, ways, to, improve, this, breeding, success, to, reduce, the, demand, to, release, as, many, reared, pheasants, and, increase, the, wild, population, as, the, original, caucasian, stock, all, but, disappeared, during, the, early, modern, era, most, dark, winged, ringless, birds, in, the, uk, are, actually, descended, from, chinese, ring, necked, and, green, pheasant, hybrids, which, were, commonly, used, for, rewilding, common, pheasants, were, introduced, in, north, america, in, 1773, and, have, become, well, established, throughout, much, of, the, rocky, mountain, states, colorado, idaho, montana, wyoming, etc, the, midwest, the, plains, states, as, well, as, canada, and, mexico, in, the, southwest, they, can, even, be, seen, south, of, the, rockies, in, bosque, del, apache, national, wildlife, refuge, 161, km, 100, mi, south, of, albuquerque, new, mexico, it, is, now, most, common, on, the, great, plains, common, pheasants, have, also, been, introduced, to, much, of, northwest, europe, the, hawaiian, islands, chile, uruguay, peru, argentina, brazil, south, africa, new, zealand, and, australia, including, the, island, state, of, tasmania, and, small, offshore, islands, such, as, rottnest, island, off, western, australia, most, common, pheasants, bagged, in, the, united, states, are, wild, born, feral, pheasants, in, some, states, captive, reared, and, released, birds, make, up, much, of, the, population, pheasant, hunting, is, very, popular, in, much, of, the, us, especially, in, the, great, plains, states, where, a, mix, of, farmland, and, native, grasslands, provides, ideal, habitat, south, dakota, alone, has, an, annual, harvest, of, over, 1, million, birds, a, year, by, over, 200, 000, hunters, there, are, a, number, of, negative, effects, of, common, pheasants, on, other, game, birds, including, nest, parasitism, disease, aggression, and, competition, for, resources, nest, parasitism, or, brood, parasitism, is, common, in, pheasants, because, of, their, propensity, to, nest, near, other, birds, and, the, fact, that, nesting, requirements, are, similar, to, those, of, other, prairie, birds, and, waterfowl, that, inhabit, the, same, areas, this, phenomenon, has, been, observed, in, grey, partridges, prairie, chickens, several, types, of, duck, rail, grouse, turkeys, and, others, effects, of, nest, parasitism, may, include, abandonment, of, nests, with, a, high, proportion, of, foreign, eggs, lower, hatching, rates, and, lower, numbers, of, eggs, laid, by, the, host, species, pheasant, eggs, also, have, a, shorter, incubation, time, than, many, of, their, nestmates, which, may, result, in, the, individual, watching, over, the, nest, to, abandon, her, own, eggs, after, the, pheasants, hatch, thinking, that, the, remaining, eggs, are, not, viable, pheasants, raised, in, other, species, nests, often, imprint, on, their, caretaker, which, may, result, in, them, adopting, atypical, behaviour, for, their, species, this, is, sometimes, the, cause, of, hybridisation, of, species, as, pheasants, adopt, the, mating, behaviour, of, their, nest, s, host, species, pheasants, often, compete, with, other, native, birds, for, resources, studies, have, shown, that, they, can, lead, to, decreased, populations, of, bobwhites, and, partridges, due, to, habitat, and, food, competition, insects, are, a, valuable, food, source, for, both, pheasants, and, partridges, and, competition, may, lead, to, decreased, populations, of, partridges, pheasants, may, also, introduce, disease, such, as, blackhead, to, native, populations, while, pheasants, tolerate, the, infection, well, other, birds, such, as, ruffed, grouse, chukar, and, grey, partridge, are, highly, susceptible, pheasants, also, have, a, tendency, to, harass, or, kill, other, birds, one, study, noted, that, in, pheasant, vs, prairie, chicken, interactions, the, pheasants, were, victorious, 78, of, the, time, a, variety, of, management, strategies, have, been, suggested, for, areas, that, are, home, to, species, that, are, particularly, threatened, by, pheasants, such, as, the, prairie, chickens, and, gray, partridge, these, strategies, include, mowing, grass, to, decrease, the, nesting, cover, preferred, by, pheasants, decreasing, pheasant, roosting, habitat, shooting, pheasants, in, organized, hunts, trapping, and, removing, them, from, areas, where, there, are, high, concentrations, of, birds, of, threatened, species, and, others, while, pheasant, populations, are, not, in, any, danger, they, have, been, decreasing, in, the, united, states, over, the, last, 30, years, largely, in, agricultural, areas, this, is, likely, due, to, changes, in, farming, practices, application, of, pesticides, habitat, fragmentation, and, increased, predation, due, to, changes, in, crops, grown, many, crops, beneficial, for, pheasants, such, as, barley, are, not, being, farmed, as, much, in, favor, of, using, the, land, for, more, lucrative, crops, such, as, nut, trees, many, of, these, new, crops, are, detrimental, to, pheasant, survival, pheasants, prefer, to, nest, in, areas, of, significant, herbaceous, cover, such, as, perennial, grasses, so, many, agricultural, areas, are, not, conducive, to, nesting, anymore, pheasant, hens, also, experience, higher, levels, of, predation, in, areas, without, patches, of, grassland, in, the, united, kingdom, about, 50, million, pheasants, reared, in, captivity, are, now, released, each, summer, a, number, which, has, significantly, increased, since, the, 1980s, most, of, these, birds, are, shot, during, the, open, season, 1, october, to, 1, february, and, few, survive, for, a, year, the, result, is, a, wildly, fluctuating, population, from, 50, million, in, july, to, less, than, 5, million, in, june, common, pheasants, are, bred, to, be, hunted, and, are, shot, in, great, numbers, in, europe, especially, the, uk, where, they, are, shot, on, the, traditional, formal, driven, shoot, principles, whereby, paying, guns, have, birds, driven, over, them, by, beaters, and, on, smaller, rough, shoots, the, open, season, in, the, uk, is, 1, october, 1, february, under, the, game, act, 1831, 1, 2, will, 4, c, 32, generally, they, are, shot, by, hunters, employing, gun, dogs,
