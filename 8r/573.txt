mambas, are, fast, moving, highly, venomous, snakes, of, the, genus, dendroaspis, which, literally, means, tree, asp, in, the, family, elapidae, four, extant, species, are, recognised, currently, three, of, those, four, species, are, essentially, arboreal, and, green, in, colour, whereas, the, black, mamba, dendroaspis, polylepis, is, largely, terrestrial, and, generally, brown, or, grey, in, colour, all, are, native, to, various, regions, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, all, are, feared, throughout, their, ranges, especially, the, black, mamba, in, africa, there, are, many, legends, and, stories, about, mambas, the, three, green, species, of, mambas, are, arboreal, whereas, the, black, mamba, is, largely, terrestrial, all, four, species, are, active, diurnal, hunters, preying, on, birds, lizards, and, small, mammals, at, nightfall, some, species, especially, the, terrestrial, black, mamba, shelter, in, a, lair, a, mamba, may, retain, the, same, lair, for, years, resembling, a, cobra, the, threat, display, of, a, mamba, includes, rearing, opening, the, mouth, and, hissing, the, black, mamba, s, mouth, is, black, within, which, renders, the, threat, more, conspicuous, a, rearing, mamba, has, a, narrower, yet, longer, hood, and, tends, to, lean, well, forward, instead, of, standing, erect, as, a, cobra, does, stories, of, black, mambas, that, chase, and, attack, humans, are, common, but, in, fact, the, snakes, generally, avoid, contact, with, humans, the, black, mamba, dendroaspis, polylepis, is, a, highly, venomous, snake, species, native, to, various, parts, of, sub, saharan, africa, black, mambas, are, fast, moving, nervous, snakes, that, will, strike, when, threatened, according, to, findings, by, branch, 2016, their, venom, comprises, neurotoxins, and, cardiotoxins, that, can, rapidly, induce, symptoms, including, dizziness, extreme, fatigue, vision, problems, foaming, at, the, mouth, paralysis, convulsions, and, eventual, death, from, respiratory, or, cardiac, failure, if, untreated, although, black, mamba, venom, is, highly, toxic, antivenom, is, available, and, can, treat, envenomation, promptly, most, apparent, cases, of, pursuit, probably, are, examples, of, where, witnesses, have, mistaken, the, snake, s, attempt, to, retreat, to, its, lair, when, a, human, happens, to, be, in, the, way, the, black, mamba, usually, uses, its, speed, to, escape, from, threats, and, humans, actually, are, their, main, predators, rather, than, prey, all, mambas, have, medically, significant, venom, with, dendrotoxins, short, chain, alpha, neurotoxins, cardiotoxins, and, fasciculins, all, mambas, are, classified, as, snakes, of, medical, importance, by, the, world, health, organization, there, are, multiple, components, in, dendrotoxins, with, different, targets, toxicity, alone, does, not, determine, severity, of, envenomation, other, factors, include, the, snake, s, temperament, venom, yields, proximity, of, wounds, to, the, cns, and, depth, of, punctures, bites, by, all, members, of, this, genus, are, capable, of, causing, rapid, onsets, of, symptoms, but, it, is, the, black, mamba, whose, bite, has, the, worst, prognosis, possibly, as, a, result, of, its, more, terrestrial, nature, having, more, potential, for, human, contact, high, defensiveness, having, a, higher, possibility, to, deliver, fatal, bites, instead, of, dry, bites, large, size, giving, it, a, higher, strike, position, proximal, to, the, victim, s, brain, and, higher, average, venom, yields, and, potential, toxicity, based, on, experimental, results, a, lethality, rate, of, near, 100, for, untreated, black, mamba, bites, has, been, circulating, between, various, sources, which, is, probably, based, on, a, single, medical, record, made, in, a, single, district, between, 1957, and, 1963, when, specific, antivenom, had, yet, to, be, introduced, seven, out, of, seven, victims, of, this, species, who, received, non, specific, polyvalent, antivenom, that, had, no, effect, on, the, species, toxins, succumbed, to, its, bites, however, another, snakebite, survey, in, south, africa, reported, a, death, rate, of, approximately, 43, among, those, who, received, ineffective, treatments, 15, fatal, cases, out, of, 35, patients, a, mamba, specific, antivenom, was, introduced, in, 1962, followed, by, a, fully, polyvalent, antivenom, in, 1971, over, this, period, 5, out, of, 38, people, in, south, africa, bitten, by, black, mambas, who, received, the, antivenom, died, according, to, the, same, report, since, then, the, number, has, significantly, dropped, with, the, widespread, use, of, specific, antivenom, despite, their, fearsome, reputation, and, often, exaggerated, notoriety, mamba, envenomation, occurs, far, less, frequently, than, some, other, snakes, for, instance, the, puff, adder, besides, proximity, to, residences, behaviour, of, a, given, species, is, also, a, critical, aspect, when, it, comes, to, snakebite, morbidities, mambas, are, agile, usually, fleeing, from, any, confrontation, with, unambiguous, threat, display, which, allows, early, recognition, of, the, serpent, avoiding, escalation, in, tension, dendroaspis, is, derived, from, ancient, greek, d, ndron, meaning, tree, and, aspis, which, is, understood, to, mean, shield, but, also, denotes, cobra, or, simply, snake, in, particular, snake, with, hood, shield, via, latin, aspis, it, is, the, source, of, the, english, word, asp, in, ancient, texts, aspis, or, asp, often, referred, to, the, egyptian, cobra, naja, haje, in, reference, to, its, shield, like, hood, the, genus, was, first, described, by, the, german, naturalist, hermann, schlegel, in, 1848, with, elaps, jamesonii, as, the, type, species, it, was, misspelt, as, dendraspis, by, dumeril, in, 1856, and, generally, uncorrected, by, subsequent, authors, in, 1936, dutch, herpetologist, leo, brongersma, pointed, out, that, the, correct, spelling, was, dendroaspis, but, added, that, the, name, was, invalid, as, fitzinger, had, coined, dendraspis, in, 1843, for, the, king, cobra, and, hence, had, priority, however, in, 1962, german, herpetologist, robert, mertens, proposed, that, the, 1843, description, of, dendraspis, by, fitzinger, be, suppressed, due, to, its, similarity, to, dendroaspis, and, the, confusion, it, would, cause, by, its, use, black, mambas, live, in, the, savannas, and, rocky, hills, of, southern, and, eastern, africa, they, are, africa, s, longest, venomous, snake, reaching, up, to, 14, feet, in, length, although, 8, 2, feet, is, more, the, average, they, are, also, among, the, fastest, snakes, in, the, world, slithering, at, speeds, of, up, to, 12, 5, miles, per, hour, including, the, nominate, subspecies, t, type, species, a, 2018, analysis, of, the, venom, of, the, mambas, as, well, as, a, 2016, genetic, analysis, found, the, following, cladogram, representative, of, the, relationship, between, the, species, ophiophagus, hannah, d, j, jamesoni, d, j, kaimosae, d, viridis, d, angusticeps, d, polylepis
