see, list, the, potato, p, t, e, t, o, is, a, starchy, root, vegetable, native, to, the, americas, that, is, consumed, as, a, staple, food, in, many, parts, of, the, world, potatoes, are, tubers, of, the, plant, solanum, tuberosum, a, perennial, in, the, nightshade, family, solanaceae, wild, potato, species, can, be, found, from, the, southern, united, states, to, southern, chile, genetic, studies, show, that, the, cultivated, potato, has, a, single, origin, in, the, area, of, present, day, southern, peru, and, extreme, northwestern, bolivia, potatoes, were, domesticated, there, about, 7, 000, 10, 000, years, ago, from, a, species, in, the, s, brevicaule, complex, many, varieties, of, the, potato, are, cultivated, in, the, andes, region, of, south, america, where, the, species, is, indigenous, the, spanish, introduced, potatoes, to, europe, in, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, from, the, americas, they, are, a, staple, food, in, many, parts, of, the, world, and, an, integral, part, of, much, of, the, world, s, food, supply, following, millennia, of, selective, breeding, there, are, now, over, 5, 000, different, varieties, of, potatoes, the, potato, remains, an, essential, crop, in, europe, especially, northern, and, eastern, europe, where, per, capita, production, is, still, the, highest, in, the, world, while, the, most, rapid, expansion, in, production, during, the, 21st, century, was, in, southern, and, eastern, asia, with, china, and, india, leading, the, world, production, as, of, 2021, like, the, tomato, and, the, nightshades, the, potato, is, in, the, genus, solanum, the, aerial, parts, of, the, potato, contain, the, toxin, solanine, normal, potato, tubers, that, have, been, grown, and, stored, properly, produce, glycoalkaloids, in, negligible, amounts, but, if, sprouts, and, potato, skins, are, exposed, to, light, tubers, can, become, toxic, the, english, word, potato, comes, from, spanish, patata, in, turn, from, ta, no, batata, which, means, sweet, potato, not, the, plant, now, known, as, simply, potato, the, name, spud, for, a, potato, is, from, the, 15th, century, spudde, a, short, knife, or, dagger, probably, related, to, danish, spyd, spear, from, around, 1840, the, name, transferred, to, the, tuber, itself, at, least, six, languages, afrikaans, dutch, french, west, frisian, hebrew, persian, and, some, variants, of, german, use, a, term, for, potato, that, means, earth, apple, or, ground, apple, potato, plants, are, herbaceous, perennials, that, grow, up, to, 1, metre, 3, 3, ft, high, the, stems, are, hairy, the, leaves, have, roughly, four, pairs, of, leaflets, the, flowers, range, from, white, or, pink, to, blue, or, purple, they, are, yellow, at, the, centre, and, are, insect, pollinated, the, plant, develops, tubers, to, store, nutrients, these, are, not, roots, but, stems, that, form, from, thickened, rhizomes, at, the, tips, of, long, thin, stolons, on, the, surface, of, the, tubers, there, are, eyes, which, act, as, sinks, to, protect, the, vegetative, buds, from, which, the, stems, originate, the, eyes, are, arranged, in, helical, form, in, addition, the, tubers, have, small, holes, that, allow, breathing, called, lenticels, the, lenticels, are, circular, and, their, number, varies, depending, on, the, size, of, the, tuber, and, environmental, conditions, tubers, form, in, response, to, decreasing, day, length, although, this, tendency, has, been, minimized, in, commercial, varieties, after, flowering, potato, plants, produce, small, green, fruits, that, resemble, green, cherry, tomatoes, each, containing, about, 300, very, small, seeds, like, the, tomato, potatoes, belong, to, the, genus, solanum, which, is, a, member, of, the, nightshade, family, the, solanaceae, that, is, a, diverse, family, of, flowering, plants, often, poisonous, that, includes, the, mandrake, mandragora, deadly, nightshade, atropa, and, tobacco, nicotiana, as, shown, in, the, outline, phylogenetic, tree, many, branches, omitted, the, most, commonly, cultivated, potato, is, s, tuberosum, there, are, several, other, species, many, garden, flowers, and, other, species, nicotiana, tobacco, atropa, nightshades, mandragora, mandrake, sweet, and, bell, peppers, s, lycopersicum, tomato, s, tuberosum, cultivated, potato, the, major, species, grown, worldwide, is, s, tuberosum, a, tetraploid, with, 48, chromosomes, and, modern, varieties, of, this, species, are, the, most, widely, cultivated, there, are, also, four, diploid, species, with, 24, chromosomes, s, stenotomum, s, phureja, s, goniocalyx, and, s, ajanhuiri, there, are, two, triploid, species, with, 36, chromosomes, s, chaucha, and, s, juzepczukii, there, is, one, pentaploid, cultivated, species, with, 60, chromosomes, s, curtilobum, there, are, two, major, subspecies, of, s, tuberosum, the, andean, potato, s, tuberosum, andigena, is, adapted, to, the, short, day, conditions, prevalent, in, the, mountainous, equatorial, and, tropical, regions, where, it, originated, the, chilean, potato, s, tuberosum, tuberosum, native, to, the, chilo, archipelago, is, in, contrast, adapted, to, the, long, day, conditions, prevalent, in, the, higher, latitude, region, of, southern, chile, wild, potato, species, occur, from, the, southern, united, states, to, southern, chile, the, potato, was, first, domesticated, in, southern, peru, and, northwestern, bolivia, by, pre, columbian, farmers, around, lake, titicaca, potatoes, were, domesticated, there, about, 7, 000, 10, 000, years, ago, from, a, species, in, the, s, brevicaule, complex, the, earliest, archaeologically, verified, potato, tuber, remains, have, been, found, at, the, coastal, site, of, ancon, central, peru, dating, to, 2500, bc, the, most, widely, cultivated, variety, solanum, tuberosum, tuberosum, is, indigenous, to, the, chilo, archipelago, and, has, been, cultivated, by, the, local, indigenous, people, since, before, the, spanish, conquest, following, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, inca, empire, the, spanish, introduced, the, potato, to, europe, in, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, as, part, of, the, columbian, exchange, the, staple, was, subsequently, conveyed, by, european, mariners, possibly, including, the, russian, american, company, to, territories, and, ports, throughout, the, world, especially, their, colonies, european, and, colonial, farmers, were, slow, to, adopt, farming, potatoes, but, after, 1750, they, became, an, important, food, staple, and, field, crop, and, played, a, major, role, in, the, european, 19th, century, population, boom, according, to, conservative, estimates, the, introduction, of, the, potato, was, responsible, for, a, quarter, of, the, growth, in, old, world, population, and, urbanization, between, 1700, and, 1900, however, lack, of, genetic, diversity, due, to, the, very, limited, number, of, varieties, initially, introduced, left, the, crop, vulnerable, to, disease, in, 1845, a, plant, disease, known, as, late, blight, caused, by, the, fungus, like, oomycete, phytophthora, infestans, spread, rapidly, through, the, poorer, communities, of, western, ireland, as, well, as, parts, of, the, scottish, highlands, resulting, in, the, crop, failures, that, led, to, the, great, irish, famine, the, international, potato, center, based, in, lima, peru, holds, 4, 870, types, of, potato, germplasm, most, of, which, are, traditional, landrace, cultivars, in, 2009, a, draft, sequence, of, the, potato, genome, was, made, containing, 12, chromosomes, and, 860, million, base, pairs, making, it, a, medium, sized, plant, genome, it, had, been, thought, that, most, potato, cultivars, derived, from, a, single, origin, in, southern, peru, and, extreme, northwestern, bolivia, from, a, species, in, the, s, brevicaule, complex, dna, analysis, however, shows, that, more, than, 99, of, all, current, varieties, of, potatoes, are, direct, descendants, of, a, subspecies, that, once, grew, in, the, lowlands, of, south, central, chile, most, modern, potatoes, grown, in, north, america, arrived, through, european, settlement, and, not, independently, from, the, south, american, sources, at, least, one, wild, potato, species, s, fendleri, occurs, in, north, america, it, is, used, in, breeding, for, resistance, to, a, nematode, species, that, attacks, cultivated, potatoes, a, secondary, center, of, genetic, variability, of, the, potato, is, mexico, where, important, wild, species, that, have, been, used, extensively, in, modern, breeding, are, found, such, as, the, hexaploid, s, demissum, used, as, a, source, of, resistance, to, the, devastating, late, blight, disease, phytophthora, infestans, another, relative, native, to, this, region, solanum, bulbocastanum, has, been, used, to, genetically, engineer, the, potato, to, resist, potato, blight, many, such, wild, relatives, are, useful, for, breeding, resistance, to, p, infestans, little, of, the, diversity, found, in, solanum, ancestral, and, wild, relatives, is, found, outside, the, original, south, american, range, this, makes, these, south, american, species, highly, valuable, in, breeding, the, importance, of, the, potato, to, humanity, is, recognised, in, the, united, nations, international, day, of, potato, to, be, celebrated, on, 30, may, each, year, starting, in, 2024, potatoes, both, s, tuberosum, and, most, of, its, wild, relatives, are, self, incompatible, they, bear, no, useful, fruit, when, self, pollinated, this, trait, is, problematic, for, crop, breeding, as, all, sexually, produced, plants, must, be, hybrids, the, gene, responsible, for, self, incompatibility, as, well, as, mutations, to, disable, it, are, now, known, self, compatibility, has, successfully, been, introduced, both, to, diploid, potatoes, including, a, special, line, of, s, tuberosum, by, crispr, cas9, plants, having, a, sli, gene, produce, pollen, which, is, compatible, to, its, own, parent, and, plants, with, similar, s, genes, this, gene, was, cloned, by, wageningen, university, and, solynta, in, 2021, which, would, allow, for, faster, and, more, focused, breeding, diploid, hybrid, potato, breeding, is, a, recent, area, of, potato, genetics, supported, by, the, finding, that, simultaneous, homozygosity, and, fixation, of, donor, alleles, is, possible, wild, potato, species, useful, for, breeding, blight, resistance, include, solanum, desmissum, and, s, stoloniferum, among, others, there, are, some, 5, 000, potato, varieties, worldwide, 3, 000, of, them, in, the, andes, alone, mainly, in, peru, bolivia, ecuador, chile, and, colombia, over, 100, cultivars, might, be, found, in, a, single, valley, and, a, dozen, or, more, might, be, maintained, by, a, single, agricultural, household, the, european, cultivated, potato, database, is, an, online, collaborative, database, of, potato, variety, descriptions, updated, and, maintained, by, the, scottish, agricultural, science, agency, within, the, framework, of, the, european, cooperative, programme, for, crop, genetic, resources, networks, which, is, run, by, the, international, plant, genetic, resources, institute, around, 80, varieties, are, commercially, available, in, the, uk, for, culinary, purposes, varieties, are, often, differentiated, by, their, waxiness, floury, or, mealy, baking, potatoes, have, more, starch, 20, 22, than, waxy, boiling, potatoes, 16, 18, the, distinction, may, also, arise, from, variation, in, the, comparative, ratio, of, two, different, potato, starch, compounds, amylose, and, amylopectin, amylose, a, long, chain, molecule, diffuses, from, the, starch, granule, when, cooked, in, water, and, lends, itself, to, dishes, where, the, potato, is, mashed, varieties, that, contain, a, slightly, higher, amylopectin, content, which, is, a, highly, branched, molecule, help, the, potato, retain, its, shape, after, being, boiled, in, water, potatoes, that, are, good, for, making, potato, chips, or, potato, crisps, are, sometimes, called, chipping, potatoes, which, means, they, meet, the, basic, requirements, of, similar, varietal, characteristics, being, firm, fairly, clean, and, fairly, well, shaped, immature, potatoes, may, be, sold, fresh, from, the, field, as, creamer, or, new, potatoes, and, are, particularly, valued, for, their, taste, they, are, typically, small, in, size, and, tender, with, a, loose, skin, and, flesh, containing, a, lower, level, of, starch, than, other, potatoes, in, the, united, states, they, are, generally, either, a, yukon, gold, potato, or, a, red, potato, called, gold, creamers, or, red, creamers, respectively, in, the, uk, the, jersey, royal, is, a, famous, type, of, new, potato, dozens, of, potato, cultivars, have, been, selectively, bred, specifically, for, their, skin, or, flesh, color, including, gold, red, and, blue, varieties, these, contain, varying, amounts, of, phytochemicals, including, carotenoids, for, gold, yellow, or, polyphenols, for, red, or, blue, cultivars, carotenoid, compounds, include, provitamin, a, alpha, carotene, and, beta, carotene, which, are, converted, to, the, essential, nutrient, vitamin, a, during, digestion, anthocyanins, mainly, responsible, for, red, or, blue, pigmentation, in, potato, cultivars, do, not, have, nutritional, significance, but, are, used, for, visual, variety, and, consumer, appeal, in, 2010, potatoes, were, bioengineered, specifically, for, these, pigmentation, traits, genetic, research, has, produced, several, genetically, modified, varieties, new, leaf, owned, by, monsanto, company, incorporates, genes, from, bacillus, thuringiensis, source, of, most, bt, toxins, in, transcrop, use, which, confers, resistance, to, the, colorado, potato, beetle, new, leaf, plus, and, new, leaf, y, approved, by, us, regulatory, agencies, during, the, 1990s, also, include, resistance, to, viruses, mcdonald, s, burger, king, frito, lay, and, procter, gamble, announced, they, would, not, use, genetically, modified, potatoes, and, monsanto, published, its, intent, to, discontinue, the, line, in, march, 2001, potato, starch, contains, two, types, of, glucan, amylose, and, amylopectin, the, latter, of, which, is, most, industrially, useful, waxy, potato, varieties, produce, waxy, potato, starch, which, is, almost, entirely, amylopectin, with, little, or, no, amylose, basf, developed, the, amflora, potato, which, was, modified, to, express, antisense, rna, to, inactivate, the, gene, for, granule, bound, starch, synthase, an, enzyme, which, catalyzes, the, formation, of, amylose, amflora, potatoes, therefore, produce, starch, consisting, almost, entirely, of, amylopectin, and, are, thus, more, useful, for, the, starch, industry, in, 2010, the, european, commission, cleared, the, way, for, amflora, to, be, grown, in, the, european, union, for, industrial, purposes, only, not, for, food, nevertheless, under, eu, rules, individual, countries, have, the, right, to, decide, whether, they, will, allow, this, potato, to, be, grown, on, their, territory, commercial, planting, of, amflora, was, expected, in, the, czech, republic, and, germany, in, the, spring, of, 2010, and, sweden, and, the, netherlands, in, subsequent, years, the, fortuna, gm, potato, variety, developed, by, basf, was, made, resistant, to, late, blight, by, introgressing, two, resistance, genes, blb1, and, blb2, from, s, bulbocastanum, a, wild, potato, native, to, mexico, rpi, blb1, is, a, nucleotide, binding, leucine, rich, repeat, nb, lrr, nlr, an, r, gene, produced, immunoreceptor, in, october, 2011, basf, requested, cultivation, and, marketing, approval, as, a, feed, and, food, from, the, efsa, in, 2012, gmo, development, in, europe, was, stopped, by, basf, in, november, 2014, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, usda, approved, a, genetically, modified, potato, developed, by, simplot, which, contains, genetic, modifications, that, prevent, bruising, and, produce, less, acrylamide, when, fried, than, conventional, potatoes, the, modifications, do, not, cause, new, proteins, to, be, made, but, rather, prevent, proteins, from, being, made, via, rna, interference, genetically, modified, varieties, have, met, public, resistance, in, the, u, s, and, in, the, european, union, potatoes, are, generally, grown, from, seed, potatoes, tubers, specifically, grown, to, be, free, from, disease, and, to, provide, consistent, and, healthy, plants, to, be, disease, free, the, areas, where, seed, potatoes, are, grown, are, selected, with, care, in, the, us, this, restricts, production, of, seed, potatoes, to, only, 15, states, out, of, all, 50, states, where, potatoes, are, grown, these, locations, are, selected, for, their, cold, hard, winters, that, kill, pests, and, summers, with, long, sunshine, hours, for, optimum, growth, in, the, uk, most, seed, potatoes, originate, in, scotland, in, areas, where, westerly, winds, reduce, aphid, attacks, and, the, spread, of, potato, virus, pathogens, potato, growth, can, be, divided, into, five, phases, during, the, first, phase, sprouts, emerge, from, the, seed, potatoes, and, root, growth, begins, during, the, second, photosynthesis, begins, as, the, plant, develops, leaves, and, branches, above, ground, and, stolons, develop, from, lower, leaf, axils, on, the, below, ground, stem, in, the, third, phase, the, tips, of, the, stolons, swell, forming, new, tubers, and, the, shoots, continue, to, grow, with, flowers, typically, developing, soon, after, tuber, bulking, occurs, during, the, fourth, phase, when, the, plant, begins, investing, the, majority, of, its, resources, in, its, newly, formed, tubers, at, this, phase, several, factors, are, critical, to, a, good, yield, optimal, soil, moisture, and, temperature, soil, nutrient, availability, and, balance, and, resistance, to, pest, attacks, the, fifth, phase, is, the, maturation, of, the, tubers, the, leaves, and, stems, senesce, and, the, tuber, skins, harden, new, tubers, may, start, growing, at, the, surface, of, the, soil, since, exposure, to, light, leads, to, an, undesirable, greening, of, the, skins, and, the, development, of, solanine, as, a, protection, from, the, sun, s, rays, growers, cover, surface, tubers, commercial, growers, cover, them, by, piling, additional, soil, around, the, base, of, the, plant, as, it, grows, called, hilling, up, or, in, british, english, earthing, up, an, alternative, method, used, by, home, gardeners, and, smaller, scale, growers, involves, covering, the, growing, area, with, mulches, such, as, straw, or, plastic, sheets, at, farm, scale, potatoes, require, a, well, drained, neutral, or, mildly, acidic, soil, ph, 6, or, 7, such, as, a, sandy, loam, the, soil, is, prepared, using, deep, tillage, for, example, with, a, chisel, plow, or, ripper, in, areas, where, irrigation, is, needed, the, field, is, leveled, using, a, landplane, so, that, water, can, be, supplied, evenly, manure, can, be, added, after, initial, irrigation, the, soil, is, then, broken, up, with, a, disc, harrow, the, potatoes, are, planted, using, a, potato, planter, machine, in, rows, 80, centimetres, 31, in, apart, at, garden, scale, potatoes, are, planted, in, trenches, or, individual, holes, some, 15, centimetres, 5, 9, in, deep, in, soil, preferably, with, additional, organic, matter, such, as, garden, compost, or, manure, alternatively, they, can, be, planted, in, containers, or, bags, filled, with, a, free, draining, compost, potatoes, are, sensitive, to, heavy, frosts, which, damage, them, in, the, ground, or, when, stored, the, historically, significant, phytophthora, infestans, the, cause, of, late, blight, remains, an, ongoing, problem, in, europe, and, the, united, states, other, potato, diseases, include, rhizoctonia, sclerotinia, pectobacterium, carotovorum, black, leg, powdery, mildew, powdery, scab, and, leafroll, virus, insects, that, commonly, transmit, potato, diseases, or, damage, the, plants, include, the, colorado, potato, beetle, the, potato, tuber, moth, the, green, peach, aphid, myzus, persicae, the, potato, aphid, tuta, absoluta, beet, leafhoppers, thrips, and, mites, the, colorado, potato, beetle, is, considered, the, most, important, insect, defoliator, of, potatoes, devastating, entire, crops, the, potato, cyst, nematode, is, a, microscopic, worm, that, feeds, on, the, roots, thus, causing, the, potato, plants, to, wilt, since, its, eggs, can, survive, in, the, soil, for, several, years, crop, rotation, is, recommended, on, a, small, scale, potatoes, can, be, harvested, using, a, hoe, or, spade, or, simply, by, hand, commercial, harvesting, is, done, with, large, potato, harvesters, which, scoop, up, the, plant, and, surrounding, earth, this, is, transported, up, an, apron, chain, consisting, of, steel, links, several, feet, wide, which, separates, some, of, the, earth, the, chain, deposits, into, an, area, where, further, separation, occurs, the, most, complex, designs, use, vine, choppers, and, shakers, along, with, a, blower, system, to, separate, the, potatoes, from, the, plant, the, result, is, then, usually, run, past, workers, who, continue, to, sort, out, plant, material, stones, and, rotten, potatoes, before, the, potatoes, are, continuously, delivered, to, a, wagon, or, truck, further, inspection, and, separation, occurs, when, the, potatoes, are, unloaded, from, the, field, vehicles, and, put, into, storage, potatoes, are, usually, cured, after, harvest, to, improve, skin, set, skin, set, is, the, process, by, which, the, skin, of, the, potato, becomes, resistant, to, skinning, damage, potato, tubers, may, be, susceptible, to, skinning, at, harvest, and, suffer, skinning, damage, during, harvest, and, handling, operations, curing, allows, the, skin, to, fully, set, and, any, wounds, to, heal, wound, healing, prevents, infection, and, water, loss, from, the, tubers, during, storage, curing, is, normally, done, at, relatively, warm, temperatures, 10, to, 16, c, or, 50, to, 60, f, with, high, humidity, and, good, gas, exchange, if, at, all, possible, storage, facilities, need, to, be, carefully, designed, to, keep, the, potatoes, alive, and, slow, the, natural, process, of, sprouting, which, involves, the, breakdown, of, starch, it, is, crucial, that, the, storage, area, be, dark, ventilated, well, and, for, long, term, storage, maintained, at, temperatures, near, 4, c, 39, f, for, short, term, storage, temperatures, of, about, 7, to, 10, c, 45, to, 50, f, are, preferred, temperatures, below, 4, c, 39, f, convert, the, starch, in, potatoes, into, sugar, which, alters, their, taste, and, cooking, qualities, and, leads, to, higher, acrylamide, levels, in, the, cooked, product, especially, in, deep, fried, dishes, the, discovery, of, acrylamides, in, starchy, foods, in, 2002, has, caused, concern, but, it, is, not, likely, that, the, acrylamides, in, food, even, if, it, is, somewhat, burnt, causes, cancer, in, humans, chemicals, are, used, to, suppress, sprouting, of, tubers, during, storage, chlorpropham, is, the, main, chemical, used, but, it, has, been, banned, in, the, eu, over, toxicity, concerns, alternatives, include, ethylene, spearmint, and, orange, oils, and, 1, 4, dimethylnaphthalene, under, optimum, conditions, in, commercial, warehouses, potatoes, can, be, stored, for, up, to, 10, 12, months, the, commercial, storage, and, retrieval, of, potatoes, involves, several, phases, first, drying, surface, moisture, wound, healing, at, 85, to, 95, relative, humidity, and, temperatures, below, 25, c, 77, f, a, staged, cooling, phase, a, holding, phase, and, a, reconditioning, phase, during, which, the, tubers, are, slowly, warmed, mechanical, ventilation, is, used, at, various, points, during, the, process, to, prevent, condensation, and, the, accumulation, of, carbon, dioxide, in, 2021, world, production, of, potatoes, was, 376, million, tonnes, 370, 000, 000, long, tons, 414, 000, 000, short, tons,

and, quality, crop, management, practices, and, the, plant, environment, improvements, in, one, or, more, of, these, yield, determinants, and, a, closure, of, the, yield, gap, could, be, a, major, boost, to, food, supply, and, farmer, incomes, in, the, developing, world, the, food, energy, yield, of, potatoes, about, 95, gigajoules, per, hectare, 9, 2, million, kilocalories, per, acre, is, higher, than, that, of, maize, 78, gj, ha, or, 7, 5, million, kcal, acre, rice, 77, gj, ha, or, 7, 4, million, kcal, acre, wheat, 31, gj, ha, or, 3, million, kcal, acre, or, soybeans, 29, gj, ha, or, 2, 8, million, kcal, acre, climate, change, is, predicted, to, have, significant, effects, on, global, potato, production, like, many, crops, potatoes, are, likely, to, be, affected, by, changes, in, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, temperature, and, precipitation, as, well, as, interactions, between, these, factors, as, well, as, affecting, potatoes, directly, climate, change, will, also, affect, the, distributions, and, populations, of, many, potato, diseases, and, pests, while, the, potato, is, less, important, than, maize, rice, wheat, and, soybeans, which, are, collectively, responsible, for, around, two, thirds, of, all, calories, consumed, by, humans, both, directly, and, indirectly, as, animal, feed, it, still, is, one, of, the, world, s, most, important, food, crops, altogether, one, 2003, estimate, suggests, that, future, 2040, 2069, worldwide, potato, yield, would, be, 18, 32, lower, than, it, was, at, the, time, driven, by, declines, in, hotter, areas, like, sub, saharan, africa, unless, farmers, and, potato, cultivars, can, adapt, to, the, new, environment, potato, plants, and, crop, yields, are, predicted, to, benefit, from, the, co2, fertilization, effect, which, would, increase, photosynthetic, rates, and, therefore, growth, reduce, water, consumption, through, lower, transpiration, from, stomata, and, increase, starch, content, in, the, edible, tubers, however, potatoes, are, more, sensitive, to, soil, water, deficits, than, some, other, staple, crops, like, wheat, in, the, uk, the, amount, of, arable, land, suitable, for, rainfed, potato, production, is, predicted, to, decrease, by, at, least, 75, these, changes, are, likely, to, lead, to, increased, demand, for, irrigation, water, particularly, during, the, potato, growing, season, potatoes, grow, best, under, temperate, conditions, temperatures, above, 30, c, 86, f, have, negative, effects, on, potato, crops, from, physiological, damage, such, as, brown, spots, on, tubers, to, slower, growth, premature, sprouting, and, lower, starch, content, these, effects, reduce, crop, yield, affecting, both, the, number, and, the, weight, of, tubers, as, a, result, areas, where, current, temperatures, are, near, the, limits, of, potatoes, temperature, range, e, g, much, of, sub, saharan, africa, will, likely, suffer, large, reductions, in, potato, crop, yields, in, the, future, on, the, other, hand, low, temperatures, reduce, potato, growth, and, present, risk, of, frost, damage, climate, change, is, predicted, to, affect, many, potato, pests, and, diseases, these, include, potato, production, is, expected, to, decline, in, many, areas, due, to, hotter, temperatures, and, decreased, water, availability, conversely, production, is, predicted, to, become, possible, in, high, altitude, and, latitude, areas, where, it, has, been, limited, by, frost, damage, such, as, in, canada, and, russia, this, will, shift, potato, production, to, cooler, areas, mitigating, much, of, the, projected, decline, in, yield, however, this, may, trigger, competition, for, land, between, potato, crops, and, other, land, uses, mostly, due, to, changes, in, water, and, temperature, regimes, the, other, approach, is, through, the, development, of, varieties, or, cultivars, which, would, be, more, adapted, to, altered, conditions, this, can, be, done, through, traditional, plant, breeding, techniques, and, genetic, modification, these, techniques, allow, for, the, selection, of, specific, traits, as, a, new, cultivar, is, developed, certain, traits, such, as, heat, stress, tolerance, drought, tolerance, fast, growth, early, maturation, and, disease, resistance, may, play, an, important, role, in, creating, new, cultivars, able, to, maintain, yields, under, stressors, induced, by, climate, change, for, instance, developing, cultivars, with, greater, heat, stress, tolerance, would, be, critical, for, maintaining, yields, in, countries, with, potato, production, areas, near, current, cultivars, maximum, temperature, limits, e, g, sub, saharan, africa, india, superior, drought, resistance, can, be, achieved, through, improved, water, use, efficiency, amount, of, food, produced, per, amount, of, water, used, or, the, ability, to, recover, from, short, drought, periods, and, still, produce, acceptable, yields, further, selecting, for, deeper, root, systems, may, reduce, the, need, for, irrigation, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, a, boiled, potato, with, skin, supplies, 87, calories, and, is, 77, water, 20, carbohydrates, including, 2, dietary, fiber, in, the, skin, and, flesh, 2, protein, and, contains, negligible, fat, table, the, protein, content, is, comparable, to, other, starchy, vegetable, staples, as, well, as, grains, boiled, potatoes, are, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, vitamin, b6, 23, dv, and, contain, a, moderate, amount, of, vitamin, c, 16, dv, and, b, vitamins, such, as, thiamine, niacin, and, pantothenic, acid, 10, dv, each, boiled, potatoes, do, not, supply, significant, amounts, of, dietary, minerals, table, the, potato, is, rarely, eaten, raw, because, raw, potato, starch, is, poorly, digested, by, humans, depending, on, the, cultivar, and, preparation, method, potatoes, can, have, a, high, glycemic, index, gi, and, so, are, often, excluded, from, the, diets, of, individuals, trying, to, follow, a, low, gi, diet, there, is, a, lack, of, evidence, on, the, effect, of, potato, consumption, on, obesity, and, diabetes, in, the, uk, potatoes, are, not, considered, by, the, national, health, service, as, counting, or, contributing, towards, the, recommended, daily, five, portions, of, fruit, and, vegetables, the, 5, a, day, program, raw, potatoes, contain, toxic, glycoalkaloids, of, which, the, most, prevalent, are, solanine, and, chaconine, solanine, is, found, in, other, plants, in, the, same, family, solanaceae, which, includes, such, plants, as, deadly, nightshade, atropa, belladonna, henbane, hyoscyamus, niger, and, tobacco, nicotiana, spp, as, well, as, food, plants, like, tomato, these, compounds, which, protect, the, potato, plant, from, its, predators, are, especially, concentrated, in, the, aerial, parts, of, the, plant, the, tubers, are, low, in, these, toxins, unless, they, are, exposed, to, light, which, makes, them, go, green, exposure, to, light, physical, damage, and, age, increase, glycoalkaloid, content, within, the, tuber, different, potato, varieties, contain, different, levels, of, glycoalkaloids, the, lenape, variety, released, in, 1967, was, withdrawn, in, 1970, as, it, contained, high, levels, of, glycoalkaloids, since, then, breeders, of, new, varieties, test, for, this, sometimes, discarding, an, otherwise, promising, cultivar, breeders, try, to, keep, glycoalkaloid, levels, below, 200, mg, kg, 0, 0032, oz, lb, however, when, these, commercial, varieties, turn, green, their, solanine, concentrations, can, go, well, above, this, limit, with, higher, levels, in, the, potato, s, skin, potato, dishes, vary, around, the, world, peruvian, cuisine, naturally, contains, the, potato, as, a, primary, ingredient, in, many, dishes, as, around, 3, 000, varieties, of, the, tuber, are, grown, there, chu, o, is, a, freeze, dried, potato, product, traditionally,
