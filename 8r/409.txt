apiformes, from, latin, apis, bees, are, winged, insects, closely, related, to, wasps, and, ants, known, for, their, roles, in, pollination, and, in, the, case, of, the, best, known, bee, species, the, western, honey, bee, for, producing, honey, bees, are, a, monophyletic, lineage, within, the, superfamily, apoidea, they, are, currently, considered, a, clade, called, anthophila, there, are, over, 20, 000, known, species, of, bees, in, seven, recognized, biological, families, some, species, including, honey, bees, bumblebees, and, stingless, bees, live, socially, in, colonies, while, most, species, 90, including, mason, bees, carpenter, bees, leafcutter, bees, and, sweat, bees, are, solitary, bees, are, found, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, in, every, habitat, on, the, planet, that, contains, insect, pollinated, flowering, plants, the, most, common, bees, in, the, northern, hemisphere, are, the, halictidae, or, sweat, bees, but, they, are, small, and, often, mistaken, for, wasps, or, flies, bees, range, in, size, from, tiny, stingless, bee, species, whose, workers, are, less, than, 2, millimetres, 0, 08, in, long, to, the, leafcutter, bee, megachile, pluto, the, largest, species, of, bee, whose, females, can, attain, a, length, of, 39, millimetres, 1, 54, in, bees, feed, on, nectar, and, pollen, the, former, primarily, as, an, energy, source, and, the, latter, primarily, for, protein, and, other, nutrients, most, pollen, is, used, as, food, for, their, larvae, vertebrate, predators, of, bees, include, primates, and, birds, such, as, bee, eaters, insect, predators, include, beewolves, and, dragonflies, bee, pollination, is, important, both, ecologically, and, commercially, and, the, decline, in, wild, bees, has, increased, the, value, of, pollination, by, commercially, managed, hives, of, honey, bees, the, analysis, of, 353, wild, bee, and, hoverfly, species, across, britain, from, 1980, to, 2013, found, the, insects, have, been, lost, from, a, quarter, of, the, places, they, inhabited, in, 1980, human, beekeeping, or, apiculture, meliponiculture, for, stingless, bees, has, been, practised, for, millennia, since, at, least, the, times, of, ancient, egypt, and, ancient, greece, bees, have, appeared, in, mythology, and, folklore, through, all, phases, of, art, and, literature, from, ancient, times, to, the, present, day, although, primarily, focused, in, the, northern, hemisphere, where, beekeeping, is, far, more, common, in, mesoamerica, the, mayans, have, practiced, large, scale, intensive, meliponiculture, since, pre, columbian, times, the, immediate, ancestors, of, bees, were, stinging, wasps, in, the, family, crabronidae, which, were, predators, of, other, insects, the, switch, from, insect, prey, to, pollen, may, have, resulted, from, the, consumption, of, prey, insects, which, were, flower, visitors, and, were, partially, covered, with, pollen, when, they, were, fed, to, the, wasp, larvae, this, same, evolutionary, scenario, may, have, occurred, within, the, vespoid, wasps, where, the, pollen, wasps, evolved, from, predatory, ancestors, based, on, phylogenetic, analysis, bees, are, thought, to, have, originated, during, the, early, cretaceous, about, 124, million, years, ago, on, the, supercontinent, of, west, gondwana, just, prior, to, its, breakup, into, south, america, and, africa, the, supercontinent, is, thought, to, have, been, a, largely, xeric, environment, at, this, time, modern, bee, diversity, hotspots, are, also, in, xeric, and, seasonal, temperate, environments, suggesting, strong, niche, conservatism, among, bees, ever, since, their, origins, genomic, analysis, indicates, that, despite, only, appearing, much, later, in, the, fossil, record, all, modern, bee, families, had, already, diverged, from, one, another, by, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, the, melittidae, apidae, and, megachilidae, had, already, evolved, on, the, supercontinent, prior, to, its, fragmentation, further, divergences, were, facilitated, by, west, gondwana, s, breakup, around, 100, million, years, ago, leading, to, a, deep, africa, south, america, split, within, both, the, apidae, and, megachilidae, the, isolation, of, the, melittidae, in, africa, and, the, origins, of, the, colletidae, andrenidae, and, halictidae, in, south, america, the, rapid, radiation, of, the, south, american, bee, families, is, thought, to, have, followed, the, concurrent, radiation, of, flowering, plants, in, the, same, region, later, in, the, cretaceous, 80, million, years, ago, colletid, bees, colonized, australia, from, south, america, with, an, offshoot, lineage, evolving, into, the, stenotritidae, and, by, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, south, american, bees, had, also, colonized, north, america, the, north, american, fossil, taxon, cretotrigona, belongs, to, a, group, that, is, no, longer, found, in, north, america, suggesting, that, many, bee, lineages, went, extinct, during, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, following, the, k, pg, extinction, surviving, bee, lineages, continued, to, spread, into, the, northern, hemisphere, colonizing, europe, from, africa, by, the, paleocene, and, then, spreading, east, to, asia, this, was, facilitated, by, the, warming, climate, around, the, same, time, allowing, bees, to, move, to, higher, latitudes, following, the, spread, of, tropical, and, subtropical, habitats, by, the, eocene, 45, mya, there, was, already, considerable, diversity, among, eusocial, bee, lineages, a, second, extinction, event, among, bees, is, thought, to, have, occurred, due, to, rapid, climatic, cooling, around, the, eocene, oligocene, boundary, leading, to, the, extinction, of, some, bee, lineages, such, as, the, tribe, melikertini, over, the, paleogene, and, neogene, different, bee, lineages, continued, to, spread, all, over, the, world, and, the, shifting, habitats, and, connectedness, of, continents, led, to, the, isolation, and, evolution, of, many, new, bee, tribes, the, oldest, non, compression, bee, fossil, is, cretotrigona, prisca, a, corbiculate, bee, of, late, cretaceous, age, 70, mya, found, in, new, jersey, amber, a, fossil, from, the, early, cretaceous, 100, mya, melittosphex, burmensis, was, initially, considered, an, extinct, lineage, of, pollen, collecting, apoidea, sister, to, the, modern, bees, but, subsequent, research, has, rejected, the, claim, that, melittosphex, is, a, bee, or, even, a, member, of, the, superfamily, apoidea, to, which, bees, belong, instead, treating, the, lineage, as, incertae, sedis, within, the, aculeata, the, allodapini, within, the, apidae, appeared, around, 53, mya, the, colletidae, appear, as, fossils, only, from, the, late, oligocene, 25, mya, to, early, miocene, the, melittidae, are, known, from, palaeomacropis, eocenicus, in, the, early, eocene, the, megachilidae, are, known, from, trace, fossils, characteristic, leaf, cuttings, from, the, middle, eocene, the, andrenidae, are, known, from, the, eocene, oligocene, boundary, around, 34, mya, of, the, florissant, shale, the, halictidae, first, appear, in, the, early, eocene, with, species, found, in, amber, the, stenotritidae, are, known, from, fossil, brood, cells, of, pleistocene, age, the, earliest, animal, pollinated, flowers, were, shallow, cup, shaped, blooms, pollinated, by, insects, such, as, beetles, so, the, syndrome, of, insect, pollination, was, well, established, before, the, first, appearance, of, bees, the, novelty, is, that, bees, are, specialized, as, pollination, agents, with, behavioral, and, physical, modifications, that, specifically, enhance, pollination, and, are, the, most, efficient, pollinating, insects, in, a, process, of, coevolution, flowers, developed, floral, rewards, such, as, nectar, and, longer, tubes, and, bees, developed, longer, tongues, to, extract, the, nectar, bees, also, developed, structures, known, as, scopal, hairs, and, pollen, baskets, to, collect, and, carry, pollen, the, location, and, type, differ, among, and, between, groups, of, bees, most, species, have, scopal, hairs, on, their, hind, legs, or, on, the, underside, of, their, abdomens, some, species, in, the, family, apidae, have, pollen, baskets, on, their, hind, legs, while, very, few, lack, these, and, instead, collect, pollen, in, their, crops, the, appearance, of, these, structures, drove, the, adaptive, radiation, of, the, angiosperms, and, in, turn, bees, themselves, bees, coevolved, not, only, with, flowers, but, it, is, believed, that, some, species, coevolved, with, mites, some, provide, tufts, of, hairs, called, acarinaria, that, appear, to, provide, lodgings, for, mites, in, return, it, is, believed, that, mites, eat, fungi, that, attack, pollen, so, the, relationship, in, this, case, may, be, mutualistic, molecular, phylogeny, was, used, by, debevic, et, al, 2012, to, demonstrate, that, the, bees, anthophila, arose, from, deep, within, the, crabronidae, sensu, lato, which, was, thus, rendered, paraphyletic, in, their, study, the, placement, of, the, monogeneric, heterogynaidae, was, uncertain, the, small, family, mellinidae, was, not, included, in, this, analysis, further, studies, by, sann, et, al, 2018, elevated, the, subfamilies, plus, one, tribe, and, one, subtribe, of, crabronidae, sensu, lato, to, family, status, they, also, recovered, the, placement, of, heterogyna, within, nyssonini, and, sunk, heterogynaidae, the, newly, erected, family, ammoplanidae, formerly, a, subtribe, of, pemphredoninae, was, recovered, as, the, most, sister, family, to, bees, ampulicidae, cockroach, wasps, astatidae, bembicidae, sphecidae, sensu, stricto, crabronidae, sensu, stricto, mellinidae, pemphredonidae, philanthidae, psenidae, ammoplanidae, anthophila, bees, this, cladogram, of, the, bee, families, is, based, on, hedtke, et, al, 2013, which, places, the, former, families, dasypodaidae, and, meganomiidae, as, subfamilies, inside, the, melittidae, english, names, where, available, are, given, in, parentheses, melittidae, inc, dasypodainae, meganomiinae, at, least, 50, mya, apidae, inc, honeybees, cuckoo, bees, carpenter, bees, 87, mya, megachilidae, mason, leafcutter, bees, 50, mya, andrenidae, mining, bees, 34, mya, halictidae, sweat, bees, 50, mya, colletidae, plasterer, bees, 25, mya, stenotritidae, large, australian, bees, 2, mya, bees, differ, from, closely, related, groups, such, as, wasps, by, having, branched, or, plume, like, setae, hairs, combs, on, the, forelimbs, for, cleaning, their, antennae, small, anatomical, differences, in, limb, structure, and, the, venation, of, the, hind, wings, and, in, females, by, having, the, seventh, dorsal, abdominal, plate, divided, into, two, half, plates, bees, have, the, following, characteristics, the, largest, species, of, bee, is, thought, to, be, wallace, s, giant, bee, megachile, pluto, whose, females, can, attain, a, length, of, 39, millimetres, 1, 54, in, the, smallest, species, may, be, dwarf, stingless, bees, in, the, tribe, meliponini, whose, workers, are, less, than, 2, millimetres, 0, 08, in, in, length, according, to, inclusive, fitness, theory, organisms, can, gain, fitness, not, just, through, increasing, their, own, reproductive, output, but, also, that, of, close, relatives, in, evolutionary, terms, individuals, should, help, relatives, when, cost, relatedness, benefit, the, requirements, for, eusociality, are, more, easily, fulfilled, by, haplodiploid, species, such, as, bees, because, of, their, unusual, relatedness, structure, in, haplodiploid, species, females, develop, from, fertilized, eggs, and, males, from, unfertilized, eggs, because, a, male, is, haploid, has, only, one, copy, of, each, gene, his, daughters, which, are, diploid, with, two, copies, of, each, gene, share, 100, of, his, genes, and, 50, of, their, mother, s, therefore, they, share, 75, of, their, genes, with, each, other, this, mechanism, of, sex, determination, gives, rise, to, what, w, d, hamilton, termed, supersisters, more, closely, related, to, their, sisters, than, they, would, be, to, their, own, offspring, workers, often, do, not, reproduce, but, they, can, pass, on, more, of, their, genes, by, helping, to, raise, their, sisters, as, queens, than, they, would, by, having, their, own, offspring, each, of, which, would, only, have, 50, of, their, genes, assuming, they, would, produce, similar, numbers, this, unusual, situation, has, been, proposed, as, an, explanation, of, the, multiple, at, least, nine, evolutions, of, eusociality, within, hymenoptera, haplodiploidy, is, neither, necessary, nor, sufficient, for, eusociality, some, eusocial, species, such, as, termites, are, not, haplodiploid, conversely, all, bees, are, haplodiploid, but, not, all, are, eusocial, and, among, eusocial, species, many, queens, mate, with, multiple, males, creating, half, sisters, that, share, only, 25, of, each, other, s, genes, but, monogamy, queens, mating, singly, is, the, ancestral, state, for, all, eusocial, species, so, far, investigated, so, it, is, likely, that, haplodiploidy, contributed, to, the, evolution, of, eusociality, in, bees, bees, may, be, solitary, or, may, live, in, various, types, of, communities, eusociality, appears, to, have, originated, from, at, least, three, independent, origins, in, halictid, bees, the, most, advanced, of, these, are, species, with, eusocial, colonies, these, are, characterised, by, cooperative, brood, care, and, a, division, of, labour, into, reproductive, and, non, reproductive, adults, plus, overlapping, generations, this, division, of, labour, creates, specialized, groups, within, eusocial, societies, which, are, called, castes, in, some, species, groups, of, cohabiting, females, may, be, sisters, and, if, there, is, a, division, of, labour, within, the, group, they, are, considered, semisocial, the, group, is, called, eusocial, if, in, addition, the, group, consists, of, a, mother, the, queen, and, her, daughters, workers, when, the, castes, are, purely, behavioural, alternatives, with, no, morphological, differentiation, other, than, size, the, system, is, considered, primitively, eusocial, as, in, many, paper, wasps, when, the, castes, are, morphologically, discrete, the, system, is, considered, highly, eusocial, true, honey, bees, genus, apis, of, which, eight, species, are, currently, recognized, are, highly, eusocial, and, are, among, the, best, known, insects, their, colonies, are, established, by, swarms, consisting, of, a, queen, and, several, thousand, workers, there, are, 29, subspecies, of, one, of, these, species, apis, mellifera, native, to, europe, the, middle, east, and, africa, africanized, bees, are, a, hybrid, strain, of, a, mellifera, that, escaped, from, experiments, involving, crossing, european, and, african, subspecies, they, are, extremely, defensive, stingless, bees, are, also, highly, eusocial, they, practise, mass, provisioning, with, complex, nest, architecture, and, perennial, colonies, also, established, via, swarming, many, bumblebees, are, eusocial, similar, to, the, eusocial, vespidae, such, as, hornets, in, that, the, queen, initiates, a, nest, on, her, own, rather, than, by, swarming, bumblebee, colonies, typically, have, from, 50, to, 200, bees, at, peak, population, which, occurs, in, mid, to, late, summer, nest, architecture, is, simple, limited, by, the, size, of, the, pre, existing, nest, cavity, and, colonies, rarely, last, more, than, a, year, in, 2011, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, set, up, the, bumblebee, specialist, group, to, review, the, threat, status, of, all, bumblebee, species, worldwide, using, the, iucn, red, list, criteria, there, are, many, more, species, of, primitively, eusocial, than, highly, eusocial, bees, but, they, have, been, studied, less, often, most, are, in, the, family, halictidae, or, sweat, bees, colonies, are, typically, small, with, a, dozen, or, fewer, workers, on, average, queens, and, workers, differ, only, in, size, if, at, all, most, species, have, a, single, season, colony, cycle, even, in, the, tropics, and, only, mated, females, hibernate, a, few, species, have, long, active, seasons, and, attain, colony, sizes, in, the, hundreds, such, as, halictus, hesperus, some, species, are, eusocial, in, parts, of, their, range, and, solitary, in, others, or, have, a, mix, of, eusocial, and, solitary, nests, in, the, same, population, the, orchid, bees, apidae, include, some, primitively, eusocial, species, with, similar, biology, some, allodapine, bees, apidae, form, primitively, eusocial, colonies, with, progressive, provisioning, a, larva, s, food, is, supplied, gradually, as, it, develops, as, is, the, case, in, honey, bees, and, some, bumblebees, most, other, bees, including, familiar, insects, such, as, carpenter, bees, leafcutter, bees, and, mason, bees, are, solitary, in, the, sense, that, every, female, is, fertile, and, typically, inhabits, a, nest, she, constructs, herself, there, is, no, division, of, labor, so, these, nests, lack, queens, and, worker, bees, for, these, species, solitary, bees, typically, produce, neither, honey, nor, beeswax, bees, collect, pollen, to, feed, their, young, and, have, the, necessary, adaptations, to, do, this, however, certain, wasp, species, such, as, pollen, wasps, have, similar, behaviours, and, a, few, species, of, bee, scavenge, from, carcases, to, feed, their, offspring, solitary, bees, are, important, pollinators, they, gather, pollen, to, provision, their, nests, with, food, for, their, brood, often, it, is, mixed, with, nectar, to, form, a, paste, like, consistency, some, solitary, bees, have, advanced, types, of, pollen, carrying, structures, on, their, bodies, very, few, species, of, solitary, bee, are, being, cultured, for, commercial, pollination, most, of, these, species, belong, to, a, distinct, set, of, genera, which, are, commonly, known, by, their, nesting, behavior, or, preferences, namely, carpenter, bees, sweat, bees, mason, bees, plasterer, bees, squash, bees, dwarf, carpenter, bees, leafcutter, bees, alkali, bees, and, digger, bees, most, solitary, bees, are, fossorial, digging, nests, in, the, ground, in, a, variety, of, soil, textures, and, conditions, while, others, create, nests, in, hollow, reeds, or, twigs, or, holes, in, wood, the, female, typically, creates, a, compartment, a, cell, with, an, egg, and, some, provisions, for, the, resulting, larva, then, seals, it, off, a, nest, may, consist, of, numerous, cells, when, the, nest, is, in, wood, usually, the, last, those, closer, to, the, entrance, contain, eggs, that, will, become, males, the, adult, does, not, provide, care, for, the, brood, once, the, egg, is, laid, and, usually, dies, after, making, one, or, more, nests, the, males, typically, emerge, first, and, are, ready, for, mating, when, the, females, emerge, solitary, bees, are, very, unlikely, to, sting, only, in, self, defense, if, ever, and, some, esp, in, the, family, andrenidae, are, stingless, while, solitary, females, each, make, individual, nests, some, species, such, as, the, european, mason, bee, hoplitis, anthocopoides, and, the, dawson, s, burrowing, bee, amegilla, dawsoni, are, gregarious, preferring, to, make, nests, near, others, of, the, same, species, and, giving, the, appearance, of, being, social, large, groups, of, solitary, bee, nests, are, called, aggregations, to, distinguish, them, from, colonies, in, some, species, multiple, females, share, a, common, nest, but, each, makes, and, provisions, her, own, cells, independently, this, type, of, group, is, called, communal, and, is, not, uncommon, the, primary, advantage, appears, to, be, that, a, nest, entrance, is, easier, to, defend, from, predators, and, parasites, when, multiple, females, use, that, same, entrance, regularly, the, life, cycle, of, a, bee, be, it, a, solitary, or, social, species, involves, the, laying, of, an, egg, the, development, through, several, moults, of, a, legless, larva, a, pupation, stage, during, which, the, insect, undergoes, complete, metamorphosis, followed, by, the, emergence, of, a, winged, adult, the, number, of, eggs, laid, by, a, female, during, her, lifetime, can, vary, from, eight, or, less, in, some, solitary, bees, to, more, than, a, million, in, highly, social, species, most, solitary, bees, and, bumble, bees, in, temperate, climates, overwinter, as, adults, or, pupae, and, emerge, in, spring, when, increasing, numbers, of, flowering, plants, come, into, bloom, the, males, usually, emerge, first, and, search, for, females, with, which, to, mate, like, the, other, members, of, hymenoptera, bees, are, haplodiploid, the, sex, of, a, bee, is, determined, by, whether, or, not, the, egg, is, fertilised, after, mating, a, female, stores, the, sperm, and, determines, which, sex, is, required, at, the, time, each, individual, egg, is, laid, fertilised, eggs, producing, female, offspring, and, unfertilised, eggs, males, tropical, bees, may, have, several, generations, in, a, year, and, no, diapause, stage, the, egg, is, generally, oblong, slightly, curved, and, tapering, at, one, end, solitary, bees, lay, each, egg, in, a, separate, cell, with, a, supply, of, mixed, pollen, and, nectar, next, to, it, this, may, be, rolled, into, a, pellet, or, placed, in, a, pile, and, is, known, as, mass, provisioning, social, bee, species, provision, progressively, that, is, they, feed, the, larva, regularly, while, it, grows, the, nest, varies, from, a, hole, in, the, ground, or, in, wood, in, solitary, bees, to, a, substantial, structure, with, wax, combs, in, bumblebees, and, honey, bees, in, most, species, larvae, are, whitish, grubs, roughly, oval, and, bluntly, pointed, at, both, ends, they, have, 15, segments, and, spiracles, in, each, segment, for, breathing, they, have, no, legs, but, move, within, the, cell, helped, by, tubercles, on, their, sides, they, have, short, horns, on, the, head, jaws, for, chewing, food, and, an, appendage, on, either, side, of, the, mouth, tipped, with, a, bristle, there, is, a, gland, under, the, mouth, that, secretes, a, viscous, liquid, which, solidifies, into, the, silk, they, use, to, produce, a, cocoon, the, cocoon, is, semi, transparent, and, the, pupa, can, be, seen, through, it, over, the, course, of, a, few, days, the, larva, undergoes, metamorphosis, into, a, winged, adult, when, ready, to, emerge, the, adult, splits, its, skin, dorsally, and, climbs, out, of, the, exuviae, and, breaks, out, of, the, cell, antoine, magnan, s, 1934, book, le, vol, des, insectes, says, that, he, and, andr, sainte, lagu, had, applied, the, equations, of, air, resistance, to, insects, and, found, that, their, flight, could, not, be, explained, by, fixed, wing, calculations, but, that, one, shouldn, t, be, surprised, that, the, results, of, the, calculations, don, t, square, with, reality, this, has, led, to, a, common, misconception, that, bees, violate, aerodynamic, theory, in, fact, it, merely, confirms, that, bees, do, not, engage, in, fixed, wing, flight, and, that, their, flight, is, explained, by, other, mechanics, such, as, those, used, by, helicopters, in, 1996, it, was, shown, that, vortices, created, by, many, insects, wings, helped, to, provide, lift, high, speed, cinematography, and, robotic, mock, up, of, a, bee, wing, showed, that, lift, was, generated, by, the, unconventional, combination, of, short, choppy, wing, strokes, a, rapid, rotation, of, the, wing, as, it, flops, over, and, reverses, direction, and, a, very, fast, wing, beat, frequency, wing, beat, frequency, normally, increases, as, size, decreases, but, as, the, bee, s, wing, beat, covers, such, a, small, arc, it, flaps, approximately, 230, times, per, second, faster, than, a, fruitfly, 200, times, per, second, which, is, 80, times, smaller, the, ethologist, karl, von, frisch, studied, navigation, in, the, honey, bee, he, showed, that, honey, bees, communicate, by, the, waggle, dance, in, which, a, worker, indicates, the, location, of, a, food, source, to, other, workers, in, the, hive, he, demonstrated, that, bees, can, recognize, a, desired, compass, direction, in, three, different, ways, by, the, sun, by, the, polarization, pattern, of, the, blue, sky, and, by, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, he, showed, that, the, sun, is, the, preferred, or, main, compass, the, other, mechanisms, are, used, under, cloudy, skies, or, inside, a, dark, beehive, bees, navigate, using, spatial, memory, with, a, rich, map, like, organization, the, gut, of, bees, is, relatively, simple, but, multiple, metabolic, strategies, exist, in, the, gut, microbiota, pollinating, bees, consume, nectar, and, pollen, which, require, different, digestion, strategies, by, somewhat, specialized, bacteria, while, nectar, is, a, liquid, of, mostly, monosaccharide, sugars, and, so, easily, absorbed, pollen, contains, complex, polysaccharides, branching, pectin, and, hemicellulose, approximately, five, groups, of, bacteria, are, involved, in, digestion, three, groups, specialize, in, simple, sugars, snodgrassella, and, two, groups, of, lactobacillus, and, two, other, groups, in, complex, sugars, gilliamella, and, bifidobacterium, digestion, of, pectin, and, hemicellulose, is, dominated, by, bacterial, clades, gilliamella, and, bifidobacterium, respectively, bacteria, that, cannot, digest, polysaccharides, obtain, enzymes, from, their, neighbors, and, bacteria, that, lack, certain, amino, acids, do, the, same, creating, multiple, ecological, niches, although, most, bee, species, are, nectarivorous, and, palynivorous, some, are, not, particularly, unusual, are, vulture, bees, in, the, genus, trigona, which, consume, carrion, and, wasp, brood, turning, meat, into, a, honey, like, substance, drinking, guttation, drops, from, leaves, is, also, a, source, of, energy, and, nutrients, most, bees, are, polylectic, generalist, meaning, they, collect, pollen, from, a, range, of, flowering, plants, but, some, are, oligoleges, specialists, in, that, they, only, gather, pollen, from, one, or, a, few, species, or, genera, of, closely, related, plants, in, melittidae, and, apidae, we, also, find, a, few, genera, that, are, highly, specialized, for, collecting, plant, oils, both, in, addition, to, and, instead, of, nectar, which, is, mixed, with, pollen, as, larval, food, male, orchid, bees, in, some, species, gather, aromatic, compounds, from, orchids, which, is, one, of, the, few, cases, where, male, bees, are, effective, pollinators, bees, are, able, to, sense, the, presence, of, desirable, flowers, through, ultraviolet, patterning, on, flowers, floral, odors, and, even, electromagnetic, fields, once, landed, a, bee, then, uses, nectar, quality, and, pollen, taste, to, determine, whether, to, continue, visiting, similar, flowers, in, rare, cases, a, plant, species, may, only, be, effectively, pollinated, by, a, single, bee, species, and, some, plants, are, endangered, at, least, in, part, because, their, pollinator, is, also, threatened, but, there, is, a, pronounced, tendency, for, oligolectic, bees, to, be, associated, with, common, widespread, plants, visited, by, multiple, pollinator, species, for, example, the, creosote, bush, in, the, arid, parts, of, the, united, states, southwest, is, associated, with, some, 40, oligoleges, many, bees, are, aposematically, coloured, typically, orange, and, black, warning, of, their, ability, to, defend, themselves, with, a, powerful, sting, as, such, they, are, models, for, batesian, mimicry, by, non, stinging, insects, such, as, bee, flies, robber, flies, and, hoverflies, all, of, which, gain, a, measure, of, protection, by, superficially, looking, and, behaving, like, bees, bees, are, themselves, m, llerian, mimics, of, other, aposematic, insects, with, the, same, colour, scheme, including, wasps, lycid, and, other, beetles, and, many, butterflies, and, moths, lepidoptera, which, are, themselves, distasteful, often, through, acquiring, bitter, and, poisonous, chemicals, from, their, plant, food, all, the, m, llerian, mimics, including, bees, benefit, from, the, reduced, risk, of, predation, that, results, from, their, easily, recognised, warning, coloration, bees, are, also, mimicked, by, plants, such, as, the, bee, orchid, which, imitates, both, the, appearance, and, the, scent, of, a, female, bee, male, bees, attempt, to, mate, pseudocopulation, with, the, furry, lip, of, the, flower, thus, pollinating, it, brood, parasites, occur, in, several, bee, families, including, the, apid, subfamily, nomadinae, females, of, these, species, lack, pollen, collecting, structures, the, scopa, and, do, not, construct, their, own, nests, they, typically, enter, the, nests, of, pollen, collecting, species, and, lay, their, eggs, in, cells, provisioned, by, the, host, bee, when, the, cuckoo, bee, larva, hatches, it, consumes, the, host, larva, s, pollen, ball, and, often, the, host, egg, also, in, particular, the, arctic, bee, species, bombus, hyperboreus, is, an, aggressive, species, that, attacks, and, enslaves, other, bees, of, the, same, subgenus, however, unlike, many, other, bee, brood, parasites, they, have, pollen, baskets, and, often, collect, pollen, in, southern, africa, hives, of, african, honeybees, a, mellifera, scutellata, are, being, destroyed, by, parasitic, workers, of, the, cape, honeybee, a, m, capensis, these, lay, diploid, eggs, thelytoky, escaping, normal, worker, policing, leading, to, the, colony, s, destruction, the, parasites, can, then, move, to, other, hives, the, cuckoo, bees, in, the, bombus, subgenus, psithyrus, are, closely, related, to, and, resemble, their, hosts, in, looks, and, size, this, common, pattern, gave, rise, to, the, ecological, principle, emery, s, rule, others, parasitize, bees, in, different, families, like, townsendiella, a, nomadine, apid, two, species, of, which, are, cleptoparasites, of, the, dasypodaid, genus, hesperapis, while, the, other, species, in, the, same, genus, attacks, halictid, bees, four, bee, families, andrenidae, colletidae, halictidae, and, apidae, contain, some, species, that, are, crepuscular, most, are, tropical, or, subtropical, but, some, live, in, arid, regions, at, higher, latitudes, these, bees, have, greatly, enlarged, ocelli, which, are, extremely, sensitive, to, light, and, dark, though, incapable, of, forming, images, some, have, refracting, superposition, compound, eyes, these, combine, the, output, of, many, elements, of, their, compound, eyes, to, provide, enough, light, for, each, retinal, photoreceptor, their, ability, to, fly, by, night, enables, them, to, avoid, many, predators, and, to, exploit, flowers, that, produce, nectar, only, or, also, at, night, vertebrate, predators, of, bees, include, bee, eaters, shrikes, and, flycatchers, which, make, short, sallies, to, catch, insects, in, flight, swifts, and, swallows, fly, almost, continually, catching, insects, as, they, go, the, honey, buzzard, attacks, bees, nests, and, eats, the, larvae, the, greater, honeyguide, interacts, with, humans, by, guiding, them, to, the, nests, of, wild, bees, the, humans, break, open, the, nests, and, take, the, honey, and, the, bird, feeds, on, the, larvae, and, the, wax, among, mammals, predators, such, as, the, badger, dig, up, bumblebee, nests, and, eat, both, the, larvae, and, any, stored, food, specialist, ambush, predators, of, visitors, to, flowers, include, crab, spiders, which, wait, on, flowering, plants, for, pollinating, insects, predatory, bugs, and, praying, mantises, some, of, which, the, flower, mantises, of, the, tropics, wait, motionless, aggressive, mimics, camouflaged, as, flowers, beewolves, are, large, wasps, that, habitually, attack, bees, the, ethologist, niko, tinbergen, estimated, that, a, single, colony, of, the, beewolf, philanthus, triangulum, might, kill, several, thousand, honeybees, in, a, day, all, the, prey, he, observed, were, honeybees, other, predatory, insects, that, sometimes, catch, bees, include, robber, flies, and, dragonflies, honey, bees, are, affected, by, parasites, including, tracheal, and, varroa, mites, however, some, bees, are, believed, to, have, a, mutualistic, relationship, with, mites, some, mites, of, genus, tarsonemus, are, associated, with, bees, they, live, in, bee, nests, and, ride, on, adult, bees, for, dispersal, they, are, presumed, to, feed, on, fungi, nest, materials, or, pollen, however, the, impact, they, have, on, bees, remains, uncertain, recent, studies, have, shown, that, mycelium, provides, honey, bees, and, stingless, bees, with, vital, nutrients, specific, fungi, such, as, zygosaccharomyces, sp, candida, sp, and, monascus, ruber, produce, chemicals, that, fight, against, bacteria, fungal, infections, from, different, species, and, viruses, recently, these, types, of, bees, have, been, observed, eating, mycelium, suggesting, that, honey, bees, have, been, foraging, mushrooms, to, collect, antimicrobial, medicine, to, boost, their, collective, immunity, without, these, vital, nutrients, honey, bee, morbidity, rates, rise, and, the, possibility, of, fungal, infections, can, spike, leading, to, unhealthy, bee, hives, and, honey, shortage, fungal, infections, can, also, lead, to, colony, collapse, disorder, so, the, ingestion, of, mycelium, lowers, the, morbidity, rate, of, honey, bees, by, preventing, those, fungal, infections, from, happening, colony, collapse, disorder, ccd, is, when, worker, bees, abandon, the, queen, bee, and, leave, behind, the, brood, and, a, few, nurse, bees, this, however, is, not, enough, to, sustain, a, hive, as, workers, are, required, to, construct, and, maintain, the, hive, structure, as, well, as, produce, honey, colony, collapse, disorder, can, also, happen, when, varroa, mites, infiltrate, a, hive, these, mites, will, attack, and, eat, bees, inside, a, hive, making, it, impossible, for, them, to, continue, to, reproduce, and, make, honey, the, presence, of, varroa, mites, results, in, a, decrease, in, bee, population, deformed, bees, an, inability, to, reproduce, on, the, bees, part, and, overall, weakening, of, the, colony, varroa, mites, are, only, capable, of, reproducing, inside, of, a, honey, bee, colony, posing, an, even, greater, threat, if, they, are, able, to, infiltrate, because, it, will, destroy, their, home, mycelium, has, been, shown, to, germinate, inside, of, varroa, mites, and, grow, from, the, inside, out, killing, the, mites, and, protecting, the, bees, the, extermination, of, mites, by, mycelium, is, a, better, alternative, to, pesticides, that, have, shown, to, be, toxic, towards, the, bee, colony, mycelium, also, plays, a, role, in, boosting, anti, inflammatory, and, antibacterial, resistance, in, bees, due, to, the, ecdysteroids, and, zygosaccharomyces, found, in, mycelium, which, are, then, fed, to, larvae, boosting, the, next, generations, immunity, and, improving, overall, hive, health, zygosaccharomyces, are, spoilage, yeasts, that, have, an, extreme, resistance, to, acids, and, preservatives, and, can, tolerate, high, concentrations, of, sugars, and, salts, honey, bees, depend, on, this, source, of, steroids, to, allow, them, to, develop, properly, during, insect, pupation, the, symbiotic, relationship, between, bees, and, mycelium, is, found, primarily, in, brazilian, stingless, bees, and, malaysian, stingless, bees, or, more, commonly, honey, bees, bee, broods, are, the, larvae, of, honeybees, they, can, typically, be, found, inside, of, a, bee, hive, and, in, man, made, hives, especially, the, honeybees, can, be, found, developing, at, different, stages, eggs, larvae, and, pupae, inside, a, hexagonal, shape, bee, larvae, are, incapable, of, producing, steroids, at, birth, so, they, ingest, mycelium, to, receive, vital, nutrients, they, cannot, create, on, their, own, such, as, ecdysteroids, and, zygosaccharomyces, sp, once, the, honey, bee, eggs, hatch, a, white, microbial, film, starts, to, grow, on, the, boundary, between, the, brood, cell, and, the, larval, food, supply, and, is, then, ingested, by, the, larvae, to, complete, their, development, gut, microbiota, play, an, immense, role, in, the, health, of, the, entire, bee, colony, three, studies, were, recently, conducted, and, each, introduced, a, new, organism, to, the, bees, gut, microbiota, the, bees, were, fed, aged, pollen, the, assembly, of, the, gut, microbiota, was, disturbed, and, antibiotic, tetracycline, entered, their, diet, all, three, studies, showed, that, the, honey, bees, ability, to, survive, decreased, drastically, and, they, became, more, likely, to, contract, parasites, and, fungal, infections, the, introduction, of, certain, mycelium, to, the, honey, bees, gut, microbiota, has, the, opposite, effect, to, what, took, place, in, these, three, studies, highlighting, the, importance, of, what, bees, ingest, and, the, impacts, it, has, on, their, survivability, during, both, the, development, and, adult, stages, as, mentioned, above, honey, bees, cannot, produce, steroids, themselves, they, must, be, ingested, through, their, diet, specifically, in, the, early, development, process, larvae, eat, the, fungus, and, the, ecdysteroids, and, zygosaccharomyces, produced, by, the, mycelium, benefit, the, larvae, ecdysteroids, are, naturally, occurring, steroids, found, in, mycelium, and, they, help, enhance, performance, and, reproduction, boosting, honey, production, and, keeping, the, hive, population, running, at, a, stable, rate, zygosaccharomyces, sp, is, essential, for, s, depilis, larvae, these, sterols, thus, have, a, high, impact, on, the, survival, rate, of, honey, bees, their, ingestion, determines, whether, the, honey, bees, will, be, able, to, protect, themselves, against, fungal, infections, viruses, and, whether, or, not, they, will, have, sufficient, strength, to, increase, honey, production, and, the, ability, to, pollinate, a, larger, area, and, more, frequently, knowledge, of, how, mycelium, boosts, honey, bees, immunity, could, be, pivotal, to, the, increase, of, a, honey, bee, s, lifespan, and, boost, reproduction, by, helping, implement, new, policies, to, prevent, the, use, of, harmful, pesticides, pesticides, have, been, diminishing, the, bee, population, recently, due, to, a, lack, of, regulations, regarding, what, can, and, cannot, be, sprayed, on, produce, to, protect, it, from, being, damaged, during, growth, when, honey, bees, collect, pollen, and, nectar, for, nutrition, and, to, make, honey, they, are, also, ingesting, harmful, chemicals, such, chemicals, take, a, toll, on, the, honey, bees, already, sensitive, gut, microbiome, and, lead, to, a, higher, morbidity, rate, in, honey, bees, these, microbes, can, suffer, with, toxic, pesticides, applied, in, agriculture, causing, dangerous, changes, in, the, colony, fitness, and, perturbing, bees, health, yordanova, m, et, al, 2022, with, the, research, provided, on, the, positive, impact, of, mycelium, on, bees, the, relationship, between, mycelium, and, honey, bees, is, symbiotic, in, that, the, survival, of, bees, and, the, mycelium, s, ability, to, help, boost, bee, pollination, boosts, the, ability, of, the, fungi, to, grow, because, bee, pollination, improves, air, and, soil, quality, thus, boosting, plant, life, allowing, for, a, higher, survivability, rate, for, both, bees, and, mycelium, if, they, are, able, to, perform, their, environmental, roles, properly, without, the, interruption, of, harmful, government, approved, pesticides, the, recent, studies, done, on, the, symbiotic, relationship, between, mycelium, and, honey, bees, will, prove, to, be, vital, in, the, argument, towards, lessening, the, types, of, chemicals, legally, allowed, to, be, sprayed, on, produce, the, use, of, pesticides, on, lawns, and, for, other, agricultural, uses, destroy, the, livelihood, of, mycelium, by, killing, the, soil, it, grows, in, inhibiting, bees, from, ingesting, the, necessary, nutrients, mycelium, provides, to, survive, homer, s, hymn, to, hermes, describes, three, bee, maidens, with, the, power, of, divination, and, thus, speaking, truth, and, identifies, the, food, of, the, gods, as, honey, sources, associated, the, bee, maidens, with, apollo, and, until, the, 1980s, scholars, followed, gottfried, hermann, 1806, in, incorrectly, identifying, the, bee, maidens, with, the, thriae, honey, according, to, a, greek, myth, was, discovered, by, a, nymph, called, melissa, bee, and, honey, was, offered, to, the, greek, gods, from, mycenean, times, bees, were, also, associated, with, the, delphic, oracle, and, the, prophetess, was, sometimes, called, a, bee, the, image, of, a, community, of, honey, bees, has, been, used, from, ancient, to, modern, times, in, aristotle, and, plato, in, virgil, and, seneca, in, erasmus, and, shakespeare, tolstoy, and, by, political, and, social, theorists, such, as, bernard, mandeville, and, karl, marx, as, a, model, for, human, society, in, english, folklore, bees, would, be, told, of, important, events, in, the, household, in, a, custom, known, as, telling, the, bees, some, of, the, oldest, examples, of, bees, in, art, are, rock, paintings, in, spain, which, have, been, dated, to, 15, 000, bc, w, b, yeats, s, poem, the, lake, isle, of, innisfree, 1888, contains, the, couplet, nine, bean, rows, will, i, have, there, a, hive, for, the, honey, bee, and, live,

bumblebees, in, britain, as, well, as, much, about, their, biology, the, playwright, laline, paull, s, fantasy, the, bees, 2015, tells, the, tale, of, a, hive, bee, named, flora, 717, from, hatching, onwards, humans, have, kept, honey, bee, colonies, commonly, in, hives, for, millennia, beekeepers, collect, honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and, royal, jelly, from, hives, bees, are, also, kept, to, pollinate, crops, and, to, produce, bees, for, sale, to, other, beekeepers, depictions, of, humans, collecting, honey, from, wild, bees, date, to, 15, 000, years, ago, efforts, to, domesticate, them, are, shown, in, egyptian, art, around, 4, 500, years, ago, simple, hives, and, smoke, were, used, jars, of, honey, were, found, in, the, tombs, of, pharaohs, such, as, tutankhamun, among, classical, era, authors, beekeeping, with, the, use, of, smoke, is, described, in, aristotle, s, history, of, animals, book, 9, the, account, mentions, that, bees, die, after, stinging, that, workers, remove, corpses, from, the, hive, and, guard, it, castes, including, workers, and, non, working, drones, but, kings, rather, than, queens, predators, including, toads, and, bee, eaters, and, the, waggle, dance, with, the, irresistible, suggestion, of, aroseiontai, it, waggles, and, parakolouthousin, they, watch, beekeeping, is, described, in, detail, by, virgil, in, his, georgics, it, is, also, mentioned, in, his, aeneid, and, in, pliny, s, natural, history, from, the, 18th, century, european, understanding, of, the, colonies, and, biology, of, bees, allowed, the, construction, of, the, moveable, comb, hive, so, that, honey, could, be, harvested, without, destroying, the, colony, bees, play, an, important, role, in, pollinating, flowering, plants, and, are, the, major, type, of, pollinator, in, many, ecosystems, that, contain, flowering, plants, it, is, estimated, that, one, third, of, the, human, food, supply, depends, on, pollination, by, insects, birds, and, bats, most, of, which, is, accomplished, by, bees, whether, wild, or, domesticated, contract, pollination, has, overtaken, the, role, of, honey, production, for, beekeepers, in, many, countries, after, the, introduction, of, varroa, mites, feral, honey, bees, declined, dramatically, in, the, us, though, their, numbers, have, since, recovered, the, number, of, colonies, kept, by, beekeepers, declined, slightly, through, urbanization, systematic, pesticide, use, tracheal, and, varroa, mites, and, the, closure, of, beekeeping, businesses, in, 2006, and, 2007, the, rate, of, attrition, increased, and, was, described, as, colony, collapse, disorder, in, 2010, invertebrate, iridescent, virus, and, the, fungus, nosema, ceranae, were, shown, to, be, in, every, killed, colony, and, deadly, in, combination, winter, losses, increased, to, about, 1, 3, varroa, mites, were, thought, to, be, responsible, for, about, half, the, losses, apart, from, colony, collapse, disorder, losses, outside, the, us, have, been, attributed, to, causes, including, pesticide, seed, dressings, using, neonicotinoids, such, as, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and, thiamethoxam, from, 2013, the, european, union, restricted, some, pesticides, to, stop, bee, populations, from, declining, further, in, 2014, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, report, warned, that, bees, faced, increased, risk, of, extinction, because, of, global, warming, in, 2018, the, european, union, decided, to, ban, field, use, of, all, three, major, neonicotinoids, they, remain, permitted, in, veterinary, greenhouse, and, vehicle, transport, usage, farmers, have, focused, on, alternative, solutions, to, mitigate, these, problems, by, raising, native, plants, they, provide, food, for, native, bee, pollinators, like, lasioglossum, vierecki, and, l, leucozonium, leading, to, less, reliance, on, honey, bee, populations, honey, is, a, natural, product, produced, by, bees, and, stored, for, their, own, use, but, its, sweetness, has, always, appealed, to, humans, before, domestication, of, bees, was, even, attempted, humans, were, raiding, their, nests, for, their, honey, smoke, was, often, used, to, subdue, the, bees, and, such, activities, are, depicted, in, rock, paintings, in, spain, dated, to, 15, 000, bc, honey, bees, are, used, commercially, to, produce, honey, they, also, produce, some, substances, used, as, dietary, supplements, with, possible, health, benefits, pollen, propolis, and, royal, jelly, though, all, of, these, can, also, cause, allergic, reactions, bees, are, considered, edible, insects, people, in, some, countries, eat, insects, including, the, larvae, and, pupae, of, bees, mostly, stingless, species, they, also, gather, larvae, pupae, and, surrounding, cells, known, as, bee, brood, for, consumption, in, the, indonesian, dish, botok, tawon, from, central, and, east, java, bee, larvae, are, eaten, as, a, companion, to, rice, after, being, mixed, with, shredded, coconut, wrapped, in, banana, leaves, and, steamed, bee, brood, pupae, and, larvae, although, low, in, calcium, has, been, found, to, be, high, in, protein, and, carbohydrate, and, a, useful, source, of, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, and, trace, minerals, iron, zinc, copper, and, selenium, in, addition, while, bee, brood, was, high, in, fat, it, contained, no, fat, soluble, vitamins, such, as, a, d, and, e, but, it, was, a, good, source, of, most, of, the, water, soluble, b, vitamins, including, choline, as, well, as, vitamin, c, the, fat, was, composed, mostly, of, saturated, and, monounsaturated, fatty, acids, with, 2, 0, being, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, apitherapy, is, a, branch, of, alternative, medicine, that, uses, honey, bee, products, including, raw, honey, royal, jelly, pollen, propolis, beeswax, and, apitoxin, bee, venom, the, claim, that, apitherapy, treats, cancer, which, some, proponents, of, apitherapy, make, remains, unsupported, by, evidence, based, medicine, the, painful, stings, of, bees, are, mostly, associated, with, the, poison, gland, and, the, dufour, s, gland, which, are, abdominal, exocrine, glands, containing, various, chemicals, in, lasioglossum, leucozonium, the, dufour, s, gland, mostly, contains, octadecanolide, as, well, as, some, eicosanolide, there, is, also, evidence, of, n, triscosane, n, heptacosane, and, 22, docosanolide, however, the, secretions, of, these, glands, could, also, be, used, for, nest, construction, over, the, last, half, century, there, has, been, a, general, decline, in, the, species, richness, of, wild, bees, and, other, pollinators, probably, attributable, to, stress, from, increased, parasites, and, disease, the, use, of, pesticides, and, a, general, decrease, in, the, number, of, wild, flowers, climate, change, probably, exacerbates, the, problem, this, is, a, major, cause, of, concern, as, it, can, cause, biodiversity, loss, and, ecosystem, degradation, as, well, as, increase, climate, change
