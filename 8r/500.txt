aplocheiloidei, cyprinodontoidei, microcyprini, regan, 1909, cyprinodontiformes, s, p, r, n, o, d, n, t, f, r, m, i, z, is, an, order, of, ray, finned, fish, comprising, mostly, small, freshwater, fish, many, popular, aquarium, fish, such, as, killifish, and, live, bearers, are, included, they, are, closely, related, to, the, atheriniformes, and, are, occasionally, included, with, them, a, colloquial, term, for, the, order, as, a, whole, is, toothcarps, though, they, are, not, actually, close, relatives, of, the, true, carps, the, latter, belong, to, the, superorder, ostariophysi, while, the, toothcarps, are, acanthopterygii, the, families, of, cyprinodontiformes, can, be, informally, divided, into, three, groups, based, on, reproductive, strategy, viviparous, and, ovoviviparous, all, species, give, live, birth, and, oviparous, all, species, are, egg, laying, the, live, bearing, groups, differ, in, whether, the, young, are, carried, to, term, within, ovoviviparous, or, without, viviparous, an, enclosing, eggshell, phylogenetically, however, one, of, the, two, suborders, the, aplocheiloidei, contains, oviparous, species, exclusively, as, do, two, of, the, four, superfamilies, of, the, other, suborder, the, cyprinodontoidea, and, valencioidea, of, the, cyprinodontoidei, vivipary, and, ovovivipary, have, evolved, independently, from, oviparous, ancestors, the, latter, possibly, twice, some, members, of, this, order, are, notable, for, inhabiting, extreme, environments, such, as, saline, or, very, warm, waters, heavily, polluted, waters, rain, water, pools, devoid, of, minerals, and, made, acidic, by, decaying, vegetation, or, isolated, situations, where, no, other, types, of, fish, occur, they, are, typically, carnivores, and, often, live, near, the, surface, where, the, oxygen, rich, water, compensates, for, environmental, disadvantages, scheel, 1968, observed, the, gut, contents, were, invariably, ants, others, have, reported, insects, worms, and, aquatic, crustaceans, aquarium, specimens, are, invariably, seen, eating, protozoans, from, the, water, column, and, the, surfaces, of, leaves, however, these, are, not, apparent, as, stomach, contents, many, members, of, the, family, cyprinodontidae, the, pupfishes, eat, plant, material, as, well, and, some, have, adapted, to, a, diet, very, high, in, algae, to, the, point, where, one, the, american, flag, fish, is, a, renowned, algae, eater, in, the, aquarium, in, spite, of, belonging, to, an, order, of, fishes, that, do, not, generally, consume, any, plant, material, in, addition, killifish, derive, some, of, the, carotenoids, and, other, chemicals, required, to, make, their, body, pigments, from, pollen, grains, on, the, surface, of, and, in, the, gut, of, insects, they, eat, from, the, surface, of, the, water, this, can, be, simulated, in, culture, by, the, use, of, special, color, enhancing, foods, that, contain, these, compounds, although, the, cyprinodontiformes, are, a, diverse, group, most, species, contained, within, are, small, to, medium, sized, fish, with, small, mouths, large, eyes, a, single, dorsal, fin, and, a, rounded, caudal, fin, the, largest, species, is, the, cuatro, ojos, anableps, dowei, which, measures, 34, cm, 13, in, in, length, while, the, smallest, the, least, killifish, heterandria, formosa, is, just, 8, mm, 0, 31, in, long, as, an, adult, cyprinodontiformes, the, family, aplocheilidae, has, been, expanded, by, some, authorities, to, include, all, the, killifishes, with, three, subfamilies, aplocheilinae, cynolebiinae, and, nothobranchiinae, but, this, is, not, the, classification, adopted, in, the, 5th, edition, of, fishes, of, the, world
