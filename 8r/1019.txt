rosaceae, r, o, z, e, s, i, i, s, i, a, s, i, e, the, rose, family, is, a, medium, sized, family, of, flowering, plants, that, includes, 4, 828, known, species, in, 91, genera, the, name, is, derived, from, the, type, genus, rosa, the, family, includes, herbs, shrubs, and, trees, most, species, are, deciduous, but, some, are, evergreen, they, have, a, worldwide, range, but, are, most, diverse, in, the, northern, hemisphere, many, economically, important, products, come, from, the, rosaceae, including, various, edible, fruits, such, as, apples, pears, quinces, apricots, plums, cherries, peaches, raspberries, blackberries, loquats, strawberries, rose, hips, hawthorns, and, almonds, the, family, also, includes, popular, ornamental, trees, and, shrubs, such, as, roses, meadowsweets, rowans, firethorns, and, photinias, among, the, most, species, rich, genera, in, the, family, are, alchemilla, 270, sorbus, 260, crataegus, 260, cotoneaster, 260, rubus, 250, and, prunus, 200, which, contains, the, plums, cherries, peaches, apricots, and, almonds, however, all, of, these, numbers, should, be, seen, as, estimates, much, taxonomic, work, remains, rosaceae, can, be, woody, trees, shrubs, climbers, or, herbaceous, plants, the, herbs, are, mostly, perennials, but, some, annuals, also, exist, such, as, aphanes, arvensis, 200, the, leaves, are, generally, arranged, spirally, but, have, an, opposite, arrangement, in, some, species, they, can, be, simple, or, pinnately, compound, either, odd, or, even, pinnate, compound, leaves, appear, in, around, 30, genera, the, leaf, margin, is, most, often, serrate, paired, stipules, are, generally, present, and, are, a, primitive, feature, within, the, family, independently, lost, in, many, groups, of, amygdaloideae, previously, called, spiraeoideae, the, stipules, are, sometimes, adnate, attached, surface, to, surface, to, the, petiole, glands, or, extrafloral, nectaries, may, be, present, on, leaf, margins, or, petioles, spines, may, be, present, on, the, midrib, of, leaflets, and, the, rachis, of, compound, leaves, flowers, of, plants, in, the, rose, family, are, generally, described, as, showy, they, are, radially, symmetrical, and, almost, always, hermaphroditic, rosaceae, generally, have, five, sepals, five, petals, and, many, spirally, arranged, stamens, the, bases, of, the, sepals, petals, and, stamens, are, fused, together, to, form, a, characteristic, cup, like, structure, called, a, hypanthium, they, can, be, arranged, in, spikes, or, heads, solitary, flowers, are, rare, rosaceae, have, a, variety, of, color, petals, but, blue, is, almost, completely, absent, the, fruits, occur, in, many, varieties, and, were, once, considered, the, main, characters, for, the, definition, of, subfamilies, amongst, rosaceae, giving, rise, to, a, fundamentally, artificial, subdivision, they, can, be, follicles, capsules, nuts, achenes, drupes, prunus, and, accessory, fruits, like, the, pome, of, an, apple, the, hip, of, a, rose, or, the, receptacle, derived, aggregate, accessory, fruit, of, a, strawberry, many, fruits, of, the, family, are, edible, but, their, seeds, often, contain, amygdalin, which, can, release, cyanide, during, digestion, if, the, seed, is, damaged, the, family, was, traditionally, divided, into, six, subfamilies, rosoideae, spiraeoideae, maloideae, pomoideae, amygdaloideae, prunoideae, neuradoideae, and, chrysobalanoideae, and, most, of, these, were, treated, as, families, by, various, authors, more, recently, 1971, chrysobalanoideae, was, placed, in, malpighiales, in, molecular, analyses, and, neuradoideae, has, been, assigned, to, malvales, schulze, menz, in, engler, s, syllabus, edited, by, melchior, 1964, recognized, rosoideae, dryadoideae, lyonothamnoideae, spireoideae, amygdaloideae, and, maloideae, they, were, primarily, diagnosed, by, the, structure, of, the, fruits, more, recent, work, has, identified, that, not, all, of, these, groups, were, monophyletic, hutchinson, 1964, and, kalkman, 2004, recognized, only, tribes, 17, and, 21, respectively, takhtajan, 1997, delimited, 21, tribes, in, 10, subfamilies, filipenduloideae, rosoideae, ruboideae, potentilloideae, coleogynoideae, kerroideae, amygdaloideae, prunoideae, spireoideae, maloideae, pyroideae, dichotomanthoideae, a, more, modern, model, comprises, three, subfamilies, one, of, which, rosoideae, has, largely, remained, the, same, while, the, boundaries, of, the, rosaceae, are, not, disputed, there, is, no, general, agreement, as, to, how, many, genera, it, contains, areas, of, divergent, opinion, include, the, treatment, of, potentilla, s, l, and, sorbus, s, l, compounding, the, problem, is, that, apomixis, is, common, in, several, genera, this, results, in, an, uncertainty, in, the, number, of, species, contained, in, each, of, these, genera, due, to, the, difficulty, of, dividing, apomictic, complexes, into, species, for, example, cotoneaster, contains, between, 70, and, 300, species, rosa, around, 100, including, the, taxonomically, complex, dog, roses, sorbus, 100, to, 200, species, crataegus, between, 200, and, 1, 000, alchemilla, around, 300, species, potentilla, roughly, 500, and, rubus, hundreds, or, possibly, even, thousands, of, species, identified, clades, include, the, phylogenetic, relationships, between, the, three, subfamilies, within, rosaceae, are, unresolved, there, are, three, competing, hypotheses, amygdaloideae, rosoideae, dryadoideae, dryadoideae, amygdaloideae, rosoideae, rosoideae, dryadoideae, amygdaloideae, amygdaloideae, has, been, identified, as, the, earliest, branching, subfamily, by, chin, et, al, 2014, li, et, al, 2015, li, et, al, 2016, and, sun, et, al, 2016, most, recently, zhang, et, al, 2017, recovered, these, relationships, using, whole, plastid, genomes, maleae, gillenieae, spiraeeae, sorbarieae, amygdaleae, kerrieae, exochordeae, neillieae, lyonothamneae, potentilleae, roseae, agrimonieae, rubeae, colurieae, ulmarieae, dryadeae, outgroup, the, sister, relationship, between, dryadoideae, and, rosoideae, is, supported, by, the, following, shared, morphological, characters, not, found, in, amygdaloideae, presence, of, stipules, separation, of, the, hypanthium, from, the, ovary, and, the, fruits, are, usually, achenes, dryadoideae, has, been, identified, as, the, earliest, branching, subfamily, by, evans, et, al, 2002, and, potter, 2003, most, recently, xiang, et, al, 2017, recovered, these, relationships, using, nuclear, transcriptomes, maleae, gillenieae, kerrieae, exochordeae, sorbarieae, amygdaleae, lyonothamneae, spiraeeae, neillieae, agrimonieae, potentilleae, roseae, colurieae, rubeae, ulmarieae, dryadeae, outgroup, rosoideae, has, been,

is, taken, from, potter, et, al, 2007, agrimonieae, potentilleae, roseae, colurieae, rubeae, ulmarieae, sorbarieae, maleae, gillenieae, spiraeeae, kerrieae, exochordeae, amygdaleae, neillieae, lyonothamneae, dryadeae, outgroup, the, sister, relationship, between, amygdaloideae, and, dryadoideae, is, supported, by, the, following, shared, biochemical, characters, not, found, in, rosoideae, production, of, cyanogenic, glycosides, and, production, of, sorbitol, the, rosaceae, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, being, found, nearly, everywhere, except, for, antarctica, they, are, primarily, concentrated, in, the, northern, hemisphere, in, regions, that, are, not, desert, or, tropical, rainforest, the, rose, family, is, considered, one, of, the, six, most, economically, important, crop, plant, families, and, includes, apples, pears, quinces, medlars, loquats, almonds, peaches, apricots, plums, cherries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, sloes, and, roses, many, genera, are, also, highly, valued, ornamental, plants, these, include, trees, and, shrubs, cotoneaster, chaenomeles, crataegus, dasiphora, exochorda, kerria, photinia, physocarpus, prunus, pyracantha, rhodotypos, rosa, sorbus, spiraea, herbaceous, perennials, alchemilla, aruncus, filipendula, geum, potentilla, sanguisorba, alpine, plants, dryas, geum, potentilla, and, climbers, rosa, however, several, genera, are, also, introduced, noxious, weeds, in, some, parts, of, the, world, costing, money, to, be, controlled, these, invasive, plants, can, have, negative, impacts, on, the, diversity, of, local, ecosystems, once, established, such, naturalised, pests, include, acaena, cotoneaster, crataegus, and, pyracantha, in, bulgaria, and, parts, of, western, asia, the, production, of, rose, oil, from, fresh, flowers, such, as, rosa, damascena, rosa, gallica, and, other, species, is, an, important, economic, industry, the, family, rosaceae, covers, a, wide, range, of, trees, bushes, and, plants
