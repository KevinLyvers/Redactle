a, hand, is, a, prehensile, multi, fingered, appendage, located, at, the, end, of, the, forearm, or, forelimb, of, primates, such, as, humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and, lemurs, a, few, other, vertebrates, such, as, the, koala, which, has, two, opposable, thumbs, on, each, hand, and, fingerprints, extremely, similar, to, human, fingerprints, are, often, described, as, having, hands, instead, of, paws, on, their, front, limbs, the, raccoon, is, usually, described, as, having, hands, though, opposable, thumbs, are, lacking, some, evolutionary, anatomists, use, the, term, hand, to, refer, to, the, appendage, of, digits, on, the, forelimb, more, generally, for, example, in, the, context, of, whether, the, three, digits, of, the, bird, hand, involved, the, same, homologous, loss, of, two, digits, as, in, the, dinosaur, hand, the, human, hand, usually, has, five, digits, four, fingers, plus, one, thumb, these, are, often, referred, to, collectively, as, five, fingers, however, whereby, the, thumb, is, included, as, one, of, the, fingers, it, has, 27, bones, not, including, the, sesamoid, bone, the, number, of, which, varies, among, people, 14, of, which, are, the, phalanges, proximal, intermediate, and, distal, of, the, fingers, and, thumb, the, metacarpal, bones, connect, the, fingers, and, the, carpal, bones, of, the, wrist, each, human, hand, has, five, metacarpals, and, eight, carpal, bones, fingers, contain, some, of, the, densest, areas, of, nerve, endings, in, the, body, and, are, the, richest, source, of, tactile, feedback, they, also, have, the, greatest, positioning, capability, of, the, body, thus, the, sense, of, touch, is, intimately, associated, with, hands, like, other, paired, organs, eyes, feet, legs, each, hand, is, dominantly, controlled, by, the, opposing, brain, hemisphere, so, that, handedness, the, preferred, hand, choice, for, single, handed, activities, such, as, writing, with, a, pencil, reflects, individual, brain, functioning, among, humans, the, hands, play, an, important, function, in, body, language, and, sign, language, likewise, the, ten, digits, of, two, hands, and, the, twelve, phalanges, of, four, fingers, touchable, by, the, thumb, have, given, rise, to, number, systems, and, calculation, techniques, many, mammals, and, other, animals, have, grasping, appendages, similar, in, form, to, a, hand, such, as, paws, claws, and, talons, but, these, are, not, scientifically, considered, to, be, grasping, hands, the, scientific, use, of, the, term, hand, in, this, sense, to, distinguish, the, terminations, of, the, front, paws, from, the, hind, ones, is, an, example, of, anthropomorphism, the, only, true, grasping, hands, appear, in, the, mammalian, order, of, primates, hands, must, also, have, opposable, thumbs, as, described, later, in, the, text, the, hand, is, located, at, the, distal, end, of, each, arm, apes, and, monkeys, are, sometimes, described, as, having, four, hands, because, the, toes, are, long, and, the, hallux, is, opposable, and, looks, more, like, a, thumb, thus, enabling, the, feet, to, be, used, as, hands, the, word, hand, is, sometimes, used, by, evolutionary, anatomists, to, refer, to, the, appendage, of, digits, on, the, forelimb, such, as, when, researching, the, homology, between, the, three, digits, of, the, bird, hand, and, the, dinosaur, hand, an, adult, human, male, s, hand, weighs, about, a, pound, areas, of, the, human, hand, include, there, are, five, digits, attached, to, the, hand, notably, with, a, nail, fixed, to, the, end, in, place, of, the, normal, claw, the, four, fingers, can, be, folded, over, the, palm, which, allows, the, grasping, of, objects, each, finger, starting, with, the, one, closest, to, the, thumb, has, a, colloquial, name, to, distinguish, it, from, the, others, the, thumb, connected, to, the, first, metacarpal, bone, and, trapezium, is, located, on, one, of, the, sides, parallel, to, the, arm, a, reliable, way, of, identifying, human, hands, is, from, the, presence, of, opposable, thumbs, opposable, thumbs, are, identified, by, the, ability, to, be, brought, opposite, to, the, fingers, a, muscle, action, known, as, opposition, the, skeleton, of, the, human, hand, consists, of, 27, bones, the, eight, short, carpal, bones, of, the, wrist, are, organized, into, a, proximal, row, scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, and, pisiform, which, articulates, with, the, bones, of, the, forearm, and, a, distal, row, trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and, hamate, which, articulates, with, the, bases, of, the, five, metacarpal, bones, of, the, hand, the, heads, of, the, metacarpals, will, each, in, turn, articulate, with, the, bases, of, the, proximal, phalanx, of, the, fingers, and, thumb, these, articulations, with, the, fingers, are, the, metacarpophalangeal, joints, known, as, the, knuckles, at, the, palmar, aspect, of, the, first, metacarpophalangeal, joints, are, small, almost, spherical, bones, called, the, sesamoid, bones, the, fourteen, phalanges, make, up, the, fingers, and, thumb, and, are, numbered, i, v, thumb, to, little, finger, when, the, hand, is, viewed, from, an, anatomical, position, palm, up, the, four, fingers, each, consist, of, three, phalanx, bones, proximal, middle, and, distal, the, thumb, only, consists, of, a, proximal, and, distal, phalanx, together, with, the, phalanges, of, the, fingers, and, thumb, these, metacarpal, bones, form, five, rays, or, poly, articulated, chains, because, supination, and, pronation, rotation, about, the, axis, of, the, forearm, are, added, to, the, two, axes, of, movements, of, the, wrist, the, ulna, and, radius, are, sometimes, considered, part, of, the, skeleton, of, the, hand, there, are, numerous, sesamoid, bones, in, the, hand, small, ossified, nodes, embedded, in, tendons, the, exact, number, varies, between, people, whereas, a, pair, of, sesamoid, bones, are, found, at, virtually, all, thumb, metacarpophalangeal, joints, sesamoid, bones, are, also, common, at, the, interphalangeal, joint, of, the, thumb, 72, 9, and, at, the, metacarpophalangeal, joints, of, the, little, finger, 82, 5, and, the, index, finger, 48, in, rare, cases, sesamoid, bones, have, been, found, in, all, the, metacarpophalangeal, joints, and, all, distal, interphalangeal, joints, except, that, of, the, long, finger, the, articulations, are, the, fixed, and, mobile, parts, of, the, hand, adapt, to, various, everyday, tasks, by, forming, bony, arches, longitudinal, arches, the, rays, formed, by, the, finger, bones, and, their, associated, metacarpal, bones, transverse, arches, formed, by, the, carpal, bones, and, distal, ends, of, the, metacarpal, bones, and, oblique, arches, between, the, thumb, and, four, fingers, of, the, longitudinal, arches, or, rays, of, the, hand, that, of, the, thumb, is, the, most, mobile, and, the, least, longitudinal, while, the, ray, formed, by, the, little, finger, and, its, associated, metacarpal, bone, still, offers, some, mobility, the, remaining, rays, are, firmly, rigid, the, phalangeal, joints, of, the, index, finger, however, offer, some, independence, to, its, finger, due, to, the, arrangement, of, its, flexor, and, extension, tendons, the, carpal, bones, form, two, transversal, rows, each, forming, an, arch, concave, on, the, palmar, side, because, the, proximal, arch, simultaneously, has, to, adapt, to, the, articular, surface, of, the, radius, and, to, the, distal, carpal, row, it, is, by, necessity, flexible, in, contrast, the, capitate, the, keystone, of, the, distal, arch, moves, together, with, the, metacarpal, bones, and, the, distal, arch, is, therefore, rigid, the, stability, of, these, arches, is, more, dependent, of, the, ligaments, and, capsules, of, the, wrist, than, of, the, interlocking, shapes, of, the, carpal, bones, and, the, wrist, is, therefore, more, stable, in, flexion, than, in, extension, the, distal, carpal, arch, affects, the, function, of, the, cmc, joints, and, the, hands, but, not, the, function, of, the, wrist, or, the, proximal, carpal, arch, the, ligaments, that, maintain, the, distal, carpal, arches, are, the, transverse, carpal, ligament, and, the, intercarpal, ligaments, also, oriented, transversally, these, ligaments, also, form, the, carpal, tunnel, and, contribute, to, the, deep, and, superficial, palmar, arches, several, muscle, tendons, attaching, to, the, tcl, and, the, distal, carpals, also, contribute, to, maintaining, the, carpal, arch, compared, to, the, carpal, arches, the, arch, formed, by, the, distal, ends, of, the, metacarpal, bones, is, flexible, due, to, the, mobility, of, the, peripheral, metacarpals, thumb, and, little, finger, as, these, two, metacarpals, approach, each, other, the, palmar, gutter, deepens, the, central, most, metacarpal, middle, finger, is, the, most, rigid, it, and, its, two, neighbors, are, tied, to, the, carpus, by, the, interlocking, shapes, of, the, metacarpal, bones, the, thumb, metacarpal, only, articulates, with, the, trapezium, and, is, therefore, completely, independent, while, the, fifth, metacarpal, little, finger, is, semi, independent, with, the, fourth, metacarpal, ring, finger, which, forms, a, transitional, element, to, the, fifth, metacarpal, together, with, the, thumb, the, four, fingers, form, four, oblique, arches, of, which, the, arch, of, the, index, finger, functionally, is, the, most, important, especially, for, precision, grip, while, the, arch, of, the, little, finger, contribute, an, important, locking, mechanism, for, power, grip, the, thumb, is, undoubtedly, the, master, digit, of, the, hand, giving, value, to, all, the, other, fingers, together, with, the, index, and, middle, finger, it, forms, the, dynamic, tridactyl, configuration, responsible, for, most, grips, not, requiring, force, the, ring, and, little, fingers, are, more, static, a, reserve, ready, to, interact, with, the, palm, when, great, force, is, needed, the, muscles, acting, on, the, hand, can, be, subdivided, into, two, groups, the, extrinsic, and, intrinsic, muscle, groups, the, extrinsic, muscle, groups, are, the, long, flexors, and, extensors, they, are, called, extrinsic, because, the, muscle, belly, is, located, on, the, forearm, the, intrinsic, muscle, groups, are, the, thenar, thumb, and, hypothenar, little, finger, muscles, the, interosseous, muscles, four, dorsally, and, three, volarly, originating, between, the, metacarpal, bones, and, the, lumbrical, muscles, arising, from, the, deep, flexor, and, are, special, because, they, have, no, bony, origin, to, insert, on, the, dorsal, extensor, hood, mechanism, the, fingers, have, two, long, flexors, located, on, the, underside, of, the, forearm, they, insert, by, tendons, to, the, phalanges, of, the, fingers, the, deep, flexor, attaches, to, the, distal, phalanx, and, the, superficial, flexor, attaches, to, the, middle, phalanx, the, flexors, allow, for, the, actual, bending, of, the, fingers, the, thumb, has, one, long, flexor, and, a, short, flexor, in, the, thenar, muscle, group, the, human, thumb, also, has, other, muscles, in, the, thenar, group, opponens, and, abductor, brevis, muscle, moving, the, thumb, in, opposition, making, grasping, possible, the, extensors, are, located, on, the, back, of, the, forearm, and, are, connected, in, a, more, complex, way, than, the, flexors, to, the, dorsum, of, the, fingers, the, tendons, unite, with, the, interosseous, and, lumbrical, muscles, to, form, the, extensorhood, mechanism, the, primary, function, of, the, extensors, is, to, straighten, out, the, digits, the, thumb, has, two, extensors, in, the, forearm, the, tendons, of, these, form, the, anatomical, snuff, box, also, the, index, finger, and, the, little, finger, have, an, extra, extensor, used, for, instance, for, pointing, the, extensors, are, situated, within, 6, separate, compartments, the, first, four, compartments, are, located, in, the, grooves, present, on, the, dorsum, of, inferior, side, of, radius, while, the, 5th, compartment, is, in, between, radius, and, ulna, the, 6th, compartment, is, in, the, groove, on, the, dorsum, of, inferior, side, of, ulna, the, hand, is, innervated, by, the, radial, median, and, ulnar, nerves, the, radial, nerve, supplies, the, finger, extensors, and, the, thumb, abductor, thus, the, muscles, that, extends, at, the, wrist, and, metacarpophalangeal, joints, knuckles, and, that, abducts, and, extends, the, thumb, the, median, nerve, supplies, the, flexors, of, the, wrist, and, digits, the, abductors, and, opponens, of, the, thumb, the, first, and, second, lumbrical, the, ulnar, nerve, supplies, the, remaining, intrinsic, muscles, of, the, hand, all, muscles, of, the, hand, are, innervated, by, the, brachial, plexus, c5, t1, and, can, be, classified, by, innervation, the, radial, nerve, supplies, the, skin, on, the, back, of, the, hand, from, the, thumb, to, the, ring, finger, and, the, dorsal, aspects, of, the, index, middle, and, half, ring, fingers, as, far, as, the, proximal, interphalangeal, joints, the, median, nerve, supplies, the, palmar, side, of, the, thumb, index, middle, and, half, ring, fingers, dorsal, branches, innervates, the, distal, phalanges, of, the, index, middle, and, half, ring, fingers, the, ulnar, nerve, supplies, the, ulnar, third, of, the, hand, both, at, the, palm, and, the, back, of, the, hand, and, the, little, and, half, ring, fingers, there, is, a, considerable, variation, to, this, general, pattern, except, for, the, little, finger, and, volar, surface, of, the, index, finger, for, example, in, some, individuals, the, ulnar, nerve, supplies, the, entire, ring, finger, and, the, ulnar, side, of, the, middle, finger, whilst, in, others, the, median, nerve, supplies, the, entire, ring, finger, the, hand, is, supplied, with, blood, from, two, arteries, the, ulnar, artery, and, the, radial, artery, these, arteries, form, three, arches, over, the, dorsal, and, palmar, aspects, of, the, hand, the, dorsal, carpal, arch, across, the, back, of, the, hand, the, deep, palmar, arch, and, the, superficial, palmar, arch, together, these, three, arches, and, their, anastomoses, provide, oxygenated, blood, to, the, palm, the, fingers, and, the, thumb, the, hand, is, drained, by, the, dorsal, venous, network, of, the, hand, with, deoxygenated, blood, leaving, the, hand, via, the, cephalic, vein, and, the, basilic, vein, the, glabrous, hairless, skin, on, the, front, of, the, hand, the, palm, is, relatively, thick, and, can, be, bent, along, the, hand, s, flexure, lines, where, the, skin, is, tightly, bound, to, the, underlying, tissue, and, bones, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, body, s, skin, the, hands, palms, as, well, as, the, soles, of, the, feet, are, usually, lighter, and, even, much, lighter, in, dark, skinned, individuals, compared, to, the, other, side, of, the, hand, indeed, genes, specifically, expressed, in, the, dermis, of, palmoplantar, skin, inhibit, melanin, production, and, thus, the, ability, to, tan, and, promote, the, thickening, of, the, stratum, lucidum, and, stratum, corneum, layers, of, the, epidermis, all, parts, of, the, skin, involved, in, grasping, are, covered, by, papillary, ridges, fingerprints, acting, as, friction, pads, in, contrast, the, hairy, skin, on, the, dorsal, side, is, thin, soft, and, pliable, so, that, the, skin, can, recoil, when, the, fingers, are, stretched, on, the, dorsal, side, the, skin, can, be, moved, across, the, hand, up, to, 3, cm, 1, 2, in, an, important, input, the, cutaneous, mechanoreceptors, the, web, of, the, hand, is, a, fold, of, skin, which, connects, the, digits, these, webs, located, between, each, set, of, digits, are, known, as, skin, folds, interdigital, folds, or, plica, interdigitalis, they, are, defined, as, one, of, the, folds, of, skin, or, rudimentary, web, between, the, fingers, and, toes, the, ratio, of, the, length, of, the, index, finger, to, the, length, of, the, ring, finger, in, adults, is, affected, by, the, level, of, exposure, to, male, sex, hormones, of, the, embryo, in, utero, this, digit, ratio, is, below, 1, for, both, sexes, but, it, is, lower, in, males, than, in, females, on, average, a, number, of, genetic, disorders, affect, the, hand, polydactyly, is, the, presence, of, more, than, the, usual, number, of, fingers, one, of, the, disorders, that, can, cause, this, is, catel, manzke, syndrome, the, fingers, may, be, fused, in, a, disorder, known, as, syndactyly, or, there, may, be, an, absence, of, one, or, more, central, fingers, a, condition, known, as, ectrodactyly, additionally, some, people, are, born, without, one, or, both, hands, amelia, hereditary, multiple, exostoses, of, the, forearm, also, known, as, hereditary, multiple, osteochondromas, is, another, cause, of, hand, and, forearm, deformity, in, children, and, adults, there, are, several, cutaneous, conditions, that, can, affect, the, hand, including, the, nails, the, autoimmune, disease, rheumatoid, arthritis, can, affect, the, hand, particularly, the, joints, of, the, fingers, some, conditions, can, be, treated, by, hand, surgery, these, include, carpal, tunnel, syndrome, a, painful, condition, of, the, hand, and, fingers, caused, by, compression, of, the, median, nerve, and, dupuytren, s, contracture, a, condition, in, which, fingers, bend, towards, the, palm, and, cannot, be, straightened, similarly, injury, to, the, ulnar, nerve, may, result, in, a, condition, in, which, some, of, the, fingers, cannot, be, flexed, a, common, fracture, of, the, hand, is, a, scaphoid, fracture, a, fracture, of, the, scaphoid, bone, one, of, the, carpal, bones, this, is, the, commonest, carpal, bone, fracture, and, can, be, slow, to, heal, due, to, a, limited, blood, flow, to, the, bone, there, are, various, types, of, fracture, to, the, base, of, the, thumb, these, are, known, as, rolando, fractures, bennet, s, fracture, and, gamekeeper, s, thumb, another, common, fracture, known, as, boxer, s, fracture, is, to, the, neck, of, a, metacarpal, one, can, also, have, a, broken, finger, the, prehensile, hands, and, feet, of, primates, evolved, from, the, mobile, hands, of, semi, arboreal, tree, shrews, that, lived, about, 60, million, years, ago, this, development, has, been, accompanied, by, important, changes, in, the, brain, and, the, relocation, of, the, eyes, to, the, front, of, the, face, together, allowing, the, muscle, control, and, stereoscopic, vision, necessary, for, controlled, grasping, this, grasping, also, known, as, power, grip, is, supplemented, by, the, precision, grip, between, the, thumb, and, the, distal, finger, pads, made, possible, by, the, opposable, thumbs, hominidae, great, apes, including, humans, acquired, an, erect, bipedal, posture, about, 3, 6, million, years, ago, which, freed, the, hands, from, the, task, of, locomotion, and, paved, the, way, for, the, precision, and, range, of, motion, in, human, hands, functional, analyses, of, the, features, unique, to, the, hand, of, modern, humans, have, shown, that, they, are, consistent, with, the, stresses, and, requirements, associated, with, the, effective, use, of, paleolithic, stone, tools, it, is, possible, that, the, refinement, of, the, bipedal, posture, in, the, earliest, hominids, evolved, to, facilitate, the, use, of, the, trunk, as, leverage, in, accelerating, the, hand, while, the, human, hand, has, unique, anatomical, features, including, a, longer, thumb, and, fingers, that, can, be, controlled, individually, to, a, higher, degree, the, hands, of, other, primates, are, anatomically, similar, and, the, dexterity, of, the, human, hand, can, not, be, explained, solely, on, anatomical, factors, the, neural, machinery, underlying, hand, movements, is, a, major, contributing, factor, primates, have, evolved, direct, connections, between, neurons, in, cortical, motor, areas, and, spinal, motoneurons, giving, the, cerebral, cortex, monosynaptic, control, over, the, motoneurons, of, the, hand, muscles, placing, the, hands, closer, to, the, brain, the, recent, evolution, of, the, human, hand, is, thus, a, direct, result, of, the, development, of, the, central, nervous, system, and, the, hand, therefore, is, a, direct, tool, of, our, consciousness, the, main, source, of, differentiated, tactile, sensations, and, a, precise, working, organ, enabling, gestures, the, expressions, of, our, personalities, there, are, nevertheless, several, primitive, features, left, in, the, human, hand, including, pentadactyly, having, five, fingers, the, hairless, skin, of, the, palm, and, fingers, and, the, os, centrale, found, in, human, embryos, prosimians, and, apes, furthermore, the, precursors, of, the, intrinsic, muscles, of, the, hand, are, present, in, the, earliest, fishes, reflecting, that, the, hand, evolved, from, the, pectoral, fin, and, thus, is, much, older, than, the, arm, in, evolutionary, terms, the, proportions, of, the, human, hand, are, plesiomorphic, shared, by, both, ancestors, and, extant, primate, species, the, elongated, thumbs, and, short, hands, more, closely, resemble, the, hand, proportions, of, miocene, apes, than, those, of, extant, primates, humans, did, not, evolve, from, knuckle, walking, apes, and, chimpanzees, and, gorillas, independently, acquired, elongated, metacarpals, as, part, of, their, adaptation, to, their, modes, of, locomotion, several, primitive, hand, features, most, likely, present, in, the, chimpanzee, human, last, common, ancestor, chlca, and, absent, in, modern, humans, are, still, present, in, the, hands, of, australopithecus, paranthropus, and, homo, floresiensis, this, suggests, that, the, derived, changes, in, modern, humans, and, neanderthals, did, not, evolve, until, 2, 5, to, 1, 5, million, years, ago, or, after, the, appearance, of, the, earliest, acheulian, stone, tools, and, that, these, changes, are, associated, with, tool, related, tasks, beyond, those, observed, in, other, hominins, the, thumbs, of, ardipithecus, ramidus, an, early, hominin, are, almost, as, robust, as, in, humans, so, this, may, be, a, primitive, trait, while, the, palms, of, other, extant, higher, primates, are, elongated, to, the, extent, that, some, of, the, thumb, s, original, function, has, been, lost, most, notably, in, highly, arboreal, primates, such, as, the, spider, monkey, in, humans, the, big, toe, is, thus, more, derived, than, the, thumb, there, is, a, hypothesis, suggesting, the, form, of, the, modern, human, hand, is, especially, conducive, to, the, formation, of, a, compact, fist, presumably, for, fighting, purposes, the, fist, is, compact, and, thus, effective, as, a, weapon, it, also, provides, protection, for, the, fingers, however, this, is, not, widely, accepted, to, be, one, of, the, primary, selective, pressures, acting, on, hand, morphology, throughout, human, evolution, with, tool, use, and, production, being, thought, to, be, far, more, influential
