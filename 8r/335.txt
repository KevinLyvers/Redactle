gnathostomata, n, o, s, t, m, t, from, ancient, greek, gnathos, jaw, stoma, mouth, are, the, jawed, vertebrates, gnathostome, diversity, comprises, roughly, 60, 000, species, which, accounts, for, 99, of, all, living, vertebrates, including, humans, most, gnathostomes, have, retained, ancestral, traits, like, true, teeth, a, stomach, and, paired, appendages, pectoral, and, pelvic, fins, arms, legs, wings, etc, other, traits, are, elastin, a, horizontal, semicircular, canal, of, the, inner, ear, myelin, sheaths, of, neurons, and, an, adaptive, immune, system, which, has, discrete, lymphoid, organs, spleen, and, thymus, and, uses, v, d, j, recombination, to, create, antigen, recognition, sites, rather, than, using, genetic, recombination, in, the, variable, lymphocyte, receptor, gene, it, is, now, assumed, that, gnathostomata, evolved, from, ancestors, that, already, possessed, a, pair, of, both, pectoral, and, pelvic, fins, until, recently, these, ancestors, known, as, antiarchs, were, thought, to, have, lacked, pectoral, or, pelvic, fins, in, addition, to, this, some, placoderms, extinct, fish, with, bony, plates, were, shown, to, have, a, third, pair, of, paired, appendages, that, had, been, modified, to, claspers, in, males, and, basal, plates, in, females, a, pattern, not, seen, in, any, other, vertebrate, group, the, osteostraci, bony, armored, jawless, fish, are, generally, considered, the, sister, taxon, of, gnathostomata, jaw, development, in, vertebrates, is, likely, a, product, of, the, supporting, gill, arches, this, development, would, help, push, water, into, the, mouth, by, the, movement, of, the, jaw, so, that, it, would, pass, over, the, gills, for, gas, exchange, the, repetitive, use, of, the, newly, formed, jaw, bones, would, eventually, lead, to, the, ability, to, bite, in, some, gnathostomes, newer, research, suggests, that, a, branch, of, placoderms, was, most, likely, the, ancestor, of, present, day, gnathostomes, a, 419, million, year, old, fossil, of, a, placoderm, named, entelognathus, had, a, bony, skeleton, and, anatomical, details, associated, with, cartilaginous, and, bony, fish, demonstrating, that, the, absence, of, a, bony, skeleton, in, chondrichthyes, is, a, derived, trait, the, fossil, findings, of, primitive, bony, fishes, such, as, guiyu, oneiros, and, psarolepis, which, lived, contemporaneously, with, entelognathus, and, had, pelvic, girdles, more, in, common, with, placoderms, than, with, other, bony, fish, show, that, it, was, a, relative, rather, than, a, direct, ancestor, of, the, extant, gnathostomes, it, also, indicates, that, spiny, sharks, and, chondrichthyes, represent, a, single, sister, group, to, the, bony, fishes, fossil, findings, of, juvenile, placoderms, which, had, true, teeth, that, grew, on, the, surface, of, the, jawbone, and, had, no, roots, making, them, impossible, to, replace, or, regrow, as, they, broke, or, wore, down, as, they, grew, older, proves, the, common, ancestor, of, all, gnathostomes, had, teeth, and, place, the, origin, of, teeth, along, with, or, soon, after, the, evolution, of, jaws, late, ordovician, aged, microfossils, of, what, have, been, identified, as, scales, of, either, acanthodians, or, shark, like, fishes, may, mark, gnathostomata, s, first, appearance, in, the, fossil, record, undeniably, unambiguous, gnathostome, fossils, mostly, of, primitive, acanthodians, begin, appearing, by, the, early, silurian, and, become, abundant, by, the, start, of, the, devonian, gnathostomata, is, traditionally, a, infraphylum, broken, into, three, top, level, groupings, chondrichthyes, or, the, cartilaginous, fish, placodermi, an, extinct, grade, of, armored, fish, and, teleostomi, which, includes, the, familiar, classes, of, bony, fish, birds, mammals, reptiles, and, amphibians, some, classification, systems, have, used, the, term, amphirhina, it, is, a, sister, group, of, the, jawless, craniates, agnatha, placodermi, acanthodians, incl, chondrichthyes, cartilaginous, fishes, actinopterygii, amphibia, sauria, mammalia, the, appearance, of, the, early, vertebrate, jaw, has, been, described, as, a, crucial, innovation, and, perhaps, the, most, profound, and, radical, evolutionary, step, in, the, vertebrate, history, fish, without, jaws, had, more, difficulty, surviving, than, fish, with, jaws, and, most, jawless, fish, became, extinct, during, the, triassic, period, however, studies, of, the, cyclostomes, the, jawless, hagfishes, and, lampreys, that, did, survive, have, yielded, little, insight, into, the, deep, remodelling, of, the, vertebrate, skull, that, must, have, taken, place, as, early, jaws, evolved, the, ancestor, of, all, jawed, vertebrates, have, gone, through, two, rounds, of, whole, genome, duplication, the, first, happened, before, the, gnathostome, and, cyclostome, split, and, appears, to, have, been, an, autopolyploidy, event, happened, within, the, same, species, the, second, occurred, after, the, split, and, was, an, allopolyploidy, event, the, result, of, hybridization, between, two, lineages, the, customary, view, is, that, jaws, are, homologous, to, the, gill, arches, in, jawless, fishes, a, series, of, gills, opened, behind, the, mouth, and, these, gills, became, supported, by, cartilaginous, elements, the, first, set, of, these, elements, surrounded, the, mouth, to, form, the, jaw, the, upper, portion, of, the, second, embryonic, arch, supporting, the, gill, became, the, hyomandibular, bone, of, jawed, fish, which, supports, the, skull, and, therefore, links, the, jaw, to, the, cranium, the, hyomandibula, is, a, set, of, bones, found, in, the, hyoid, region, in, most, fishes, it, usually, plays, a, role, in, suspending, the, jaws, or, the, operculum, in, the, case, of, teleosts, while, potentially, older, ordovician, records, are, known, the, oldest, unambigious, evidence, of, jawed, vertebrates, are, qianodus, and, fanjingshania, from, the, early, silurian, aeronian, of, guizhou, china, around, 439, million, years, ago, which, are, placed, as, acanthodian, grade, stem, chondrichthyans
