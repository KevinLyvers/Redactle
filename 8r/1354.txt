hypertension, also, known, as, high, blood, pressure, is, a, long, term, medical, condition, in, which, the, blood, pressure, in, the, arteries, is, persistently, elevated, high, blood, pressure, usually, does, not, cause, symptoms, itself, it, is, however, a, major, risk, factor, for, stroke, coronary, artery, disease, heart, failure, atrial, fibrillation, peripheral, arterial, disease, vision, loss, chronic, kidney, disease, and, dementia, hypertension, is, a, major, cause, of, premature, death, worldwide, high, blood, pressure, is, classified, as, primary, essential, hypertension, or, secondary, hypertension, about, 90, 95, of, cases, are, primary, defined, as, high, blood, pressure, due, to, nonspecific, lifestyle, and, genetic, factors, lifestyle, factors, that, increase, the, risk, include, excess, salt, in, the, diet, excess, body, weight, smoking, physical, inactivity, and, alcohol, use, the, remaining, 5, 10, of, cases, are, categorized, as, secondary, hypertension, defined, as, high, blood, pressure, due, to, a, clearly, identifiable, cause, such, as, chronic, kidney, disease, narrowing, of, the, kidney, arteries, an, endocrine, disorder, or, the, use, of, birth, control, pills, blood, pressure, is, classified, by, two, measurements, the, systolic, first, number, and, diastolic, second, number, pressures, for, most, adults, normal, blood, pressure, at, rest, is, within, the, range, of, 100, 140, millimeters, mercury, mmhg, systolic, and, 60, 90, mmhg, diastolic, for, most, adults, high, blood, pressure, is, present, if, the, resting, blood, pressure, is, persistently, at, or, above, 130, 80, or, 140, 90, mmhg, different, numbers, apply, to, children, ambulatory, blood, pressure, monitoring, over, a, 24, hour, period, appears, more, accurate, than, office, based, blood, pressure, measurement, lifestyle, changes, and, medications, can, lower, blood, pressure, and, decrease, the, risk, of, health, complications, lifestyle, changes, include, weight, loss, physical, exercise, decreased, salt, intake, reducing, alcohol, intake, and, a, healthy, diet, if, lifestyle, changes, are, not, sufficient, blood, pressure, medications, are, used, up, to, three, medications, taken, concurrently, can, control, blood, pressure, in, 90, of, people, the, treatment, of, moderately, high, arterial, blood, pressure, defined, as, 160, 100, mmhg, with, medications, is, associated, with, an, improved, life, expectancy, the, effect, of, treatment, of, blood, pressure, between, 130, 80, mmhg, and, 160, 100, mmhg, is, less, clear, with, some, reviews, finding, benefit, and, others, finding, unclear, benefit, high, blood, pressure, affects, 33, of, the, population, globally, about, half, of, all, people, with, high, blood, pressure, do, not, know, that, they, have, it, in, 2019, high, blood, pressure, was, believed, to, have, been, a, factor, in, 19, of, all, deaths, 10, 4, million, globally, hypertension, is, rarely, accompanied, by, symptoms, half, of, all, people, with, hypertension, are, unaware, that, they, have, it, hypertension, is, usually, identified, as, part, of, health, screening, or, when, seeking, healthcare, for, an, unrelated, problem, some, people, with, high, blood, pressure, report, headaches, as, well, as, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus, buzzing, or, hissing, in, the, ears, altered, vision, or, fainting, episodes, these, symptoms, however, might, be, related, to, associated, anxiety, rather, than, the, high, blood, pressure, itself, long, standing, untreated, hypertension, can, cause, organ, damage, with, signs, such, as, changes, in, the, optic, fundus, seen, by, ophthalmoscopy, the, severity, of, hypertensive, retinopathy, correlates, roughly, with, the, duration, or, the, severity, of, the, hypertension, other, hypertension, caused, organ, damage, include, chronic, kidney, disease, and, thickening, of, the, heart, muscle, secondary, hypertension, is, hypertension, due, to, an, identifiable, cause, and, may, result, in, certain, specific, additional, signs, and, symptoms, for, example, as, well, as, causing, high, blood, pressure, cushing, s, syndrome, frequently, causes, truncal, obesity, glucose, intolerance, moon, face, a, hump, of, fat, behind, the, neck, and, shoulders, referred, to, as, a, buffalo, hump, and, purple, abdominal, stretch, marks, hyperthyroidism, frequently, causes, weight, loss, with, increased, appetite, fast, heart, rate, bulging, eyes, and, tremor, renal, artery, stenosis, may, be, associated, with, a, localized, abdominal, bruit, to, the, left, or, right, of, the, midline, or, in, both, locations, coarctation, of, the, aorta, frequently, causes, a, decreased, blood, pressure, in, the, lower, extremities, relative, to, the, arms, or, delayed, or, absent, femoral, arterial, pulses, pheochromocytoma, may, cause, abrupt, episodes, of, hypertension, accompanied, by, headache, palpitations, pale, appearance, and, excessive, sweating, severely, elevated, blood, pressure, equal, to, or, greater, than, a, systolic, 180, mmhg, or, diastolic, of, 120, mmhg, is, referred, to, as, a, hypertensive, crisis, hypertensive, crisis, is, categorized, as, either, hypertensive, urgency, or, hypertensive, emergency, according, to, the, absence, or, presence, of, end, organ, damage, respectively, in, hypertensive, urgency, there, is, no, evidence, of, end, organ, damage, resulting, from, the, elevated, blood, pressure, in, these, cases, oral, medications, are, used, to, lower, the, bp, gradually, over, 24, to, 48, hours, in, hypertensive, emergency, there, is, evidence, of, direct, damage, to, one, or, more, organs, the, most, affected, organs, include, the, brain, kidney, heart, and, lungs, producing, symptoms, which, may, include, confusion, drowsiness, chest, pain, and, breathlessness, in, hypertensive, emergency, the, blood, pressure, must, be, reduced, more, rapidly, to, stop, ongoing, organ, damage, however, there, is, a, lack, of, randomized, controlled, trial, evidence, for, this, approach, hypertension, occurs, in, approximately, 8, 10, of, pregnancies, two, blood, pressure, measurements, six, hours, apart, of, greater, than, 140, 90, mmhg, are, diagnostic, of, hypertension, in, pregnancy, high, blood, pressure, in, pregnancy, can, be, classified, as, pre, existing, hypertension, gestational, hypertension, or, pre, eclampsia, women, who, have, chronic, hypertension, before, their, pregnancy, are, at, increased, risk, of, complications, such, as, premature, birth, low, birthweight, or, stillbirth, women, who, have, high, blood, pressure, and, had, complications, in, their, pregnancy, have, three, times, the, risk, of, developing, cardiovascular, disease, compared, to, women, with, normal, blood, pressure, who, had, no, complications, in, pregnancy, pre, eclampsia, is, a, serious, condition, of, the, second, half, of, pregnancy, and, following, delivery, characterised, by, increased, blood, pressure, and, the, presence, of, protein, in, the, urine, it, occurs, in, about, 5, of, pregnancies, and, is, responsible, for, approximately, 16, of, all, maternal, deaths, globally, pre, eclampsia, also, doubles, the, risk, of, death, of, the, baby, around, the, time, of, birth, usually, there, are, no, symptoms, in, pre, eclampsia, and, it, is, detected, by, routine, screening, when, symptoms, of, pre, eclampsia, occur, the, most, common, are, headache, visual, disturbance, often, flashing, lights, vomiting, pain, over, the, stomach, and, swelling, pre, eclampsia, can, occasionally, progress, to, a, life, threatening, condition, called, eclampsia, which, is, a, hypertensive, emergency, and, has, several, serious, complications, including, vision, loss, brain, swelling, seizures, kidney, failure, pulmonary, edema, and, disseminated, intravascular, coagulation, a, blood, clotting, disorder, in, contrast, gestational, hypertension, is, defined, as, new, onset, hypertension, during, pregnancy, without, protein, in, the, urine, failure, to, thrive, seizures, irritability, lack, of, energy, and, difficulty, in, breathing, can, be, associated, with, hypertension, in, newborns, and, young, infants, in, older, infants, and, children, hypertension, can, cause, headache, unexplained, irritability, fatigue, failure, to, thrive, blurred, vision, nosebleeds, and, facial, paralysis, hypertension, results, from, a, complex, interaction, of, genes, and, environmental, factors, numerous, common, genetic, variants, with, small, effects, on, blood, pressure, have, been, identified, as, well, as, some, rare, genetic, variants, with, large, effects, on, blood, pressure, also, genome, wide, association, studies, gwas, have, identified, 35, genetic, loci, related, to, blood, pressure, 12, of, these, genetic, loci, influencing, blood, pressure, were, newly, found, sentinel, snp, for, each, new, genetic, locus, identified, has, shown, an, association, with, dna, methylation, at, multiple, nearby, cpg, sites, these, sentinel, snp, are, located, within, genes, related, to, vascular, smooth, muscle, and, renal, function, dna, methylation, might, affect, in, some, way, linking, common, genetic, variation, to, multiple, phenotypes, even, though, mechanisms, underlying, these, associations, are, not, understood, single, variant, test, performed, in, this, study, for, the, 35, sentinel, snp, known, and, new, showed, that, genetic, variants, singly, or, in, aggregate, contribute, to, risk, of, clinical, phenotypes, related, to, high, blood, pressure, blood, pressure, rises, with, aging, when, associated, with, a, western, diet, and, lifestyle, and, the, risk, of, becoming, hypertensive, in, later, life, is, significant, several, environmental, factors, influence, blood, pressure, high, salt, intake, raises, the, blood, pressure, in, salt, sensitive, individuals, lack, of, exercise, and, central, obesity, can, play, a, role, in, individual, cases, the, possible, roles, of, other, factors, such, as, caffeine, consumption, and, vitamin, d, deficiency, are, less, clear, insulin, resistance, which, is, common, in, obesity, and, is, a, component, of, syndrome, x, or, the, metabolic, syndrome, also, contributes, to, hypertension, events, in, early, life, such, as, low, birth, weight, maternal, smoking, and, lack, of, breastfeeding, may, be, risk, factors, for, adult, essential, hypertension, although, the, mechanisms, linking, these, exposures, to, adult, hypertension, remain, unclear, an, increased, rate, of, high, blood, uric, acid, has, been, found, in, untreated, people, with, hypertension, in, comparison, with, people, with, normal, blood, pressure, although, it, is, uncertain, whether, the, former, plays, a, causal, role, or, is, subsidiary, to, poor, kidney, function, average, blood, pressure, may, be, higher, in, the, winter, than, in, the, summer, periodontal, disease, is, also, associated, with, high, blood, pressure, secondary, hypertension, results, from, an, identifiable, cause, kidney, disease, is, the, most, common, secondary, cause, of, hypertension, hypertension, can, also, be, caused, by, endocrine, conditions, such, as, cushing, s, syndrome, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, conn, s, syndrome, or, hyperaldosteronism, renal, artery, stenosis, from, atherosclerosis, or, fibromuscular, dysplasia, hyperparathyroidism, and, pheochromocytoma, other, causes, of, secondary, hypertension, include, obesity, sleep, apnea, pregnancy, coarctation, of, the, aorta, excessive, eating, of, liquorice, excessive, drinking, of, alcohol, certain, prescription, medicines, herbal, remedies, and, stimulants, such, as, coffee, cocaine, and, methamphetamine, arsenic, exposure, through, drinking, water, has, been, shown, to, correlate, with, elevated, blood, pressure, depression, was, also, linked, to, hypertension, loneliness, is, also, a, risk, factor, air, pollution, may, be, associated, with, hypertension, a, 2018, review, found, that, any, alcohol, increased, blood, pressure, in, males, while, over, one, or, two, drinks, increased, the, risk, in, females, in, most, people, with, established, essential, hypertension, increased, resistance, to, blood, flow, total, peripheral, resistance, accounts, for, the, high, pressure, while, cardiac, output, remains, normal, there, is, evidence, that, some, younger, people, with, prehypertension, or, borderline, hypertension, have, high, cardiac, output, an, elevated, heart, rate, and, normal, peripheral, resistance, termed, hyperkinetic, borderline, hypertension, these, individuals, develop, the, typical, features, of, established, essential, hypertension, in, later, life, as, their, cardiac, output, falls, and, peripheral, resistance, rises, with, age, whether, this, pattern, is, typical, of, all, people, who, ultimately, develop, hypertension, is, disputed, the, increased, peripheral, resistance, in, established, hypertension, is, mainly, attributable, to, structural, narrowing, of, small, arteries, and, arterioles, although, a, reduction, in, the, number, or, density, of, capillaries, may, also, contribute, it, is, not, clear, whether, or, not, vasoconstriction, of, arteriolar, blood, vessels, plays, a, role, in, hypertension, hypertension, is, also, associated, with, decreased, peripheral, venous, compliance, which, may, increase, venous, return, increase, cardiac, preload, and, ultimately, cause, diastolic, dysfunction, for, patients, having, hypertension, higher, heart, rate, variability, hrv, is, a, risk, factor, for, atrial, fibrillation, pulse, pressure, the, difference, between, systolic, and, diastolic, blood, pressure, is, frequently, increased, in, older, people, with, hypertension, this, can, mean, that, systolic, pressure, is, abnormally, high, but, diastolic, pressure, may, be, normal, or, low, a, condition, termed, isolated, systolic, hypertension, the, high, pulse, pressure, in, elderly, people, with, hypertension, or, isolated, systolic, hypertension, is, explained, by, increased, arterial, stiffness, which, typically, accompanies, aging, and, may, be, exacerbated, by, high, blood, pressure, many, mechanisms, have, been, proposed, to, account, for, the, rise, in, peripheral, resistance, in, hypertension, most, evidence, implicates, either, disturbances, in, the, kidneys, salt, and, water, handling, particularly, abnormalities, in, the, intrarenal, renin, angiotensin, system, or, abnormalities, of, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, these, mechanisms, are, not, mutually, exclusive, and, it, is, likely, that, both, contribute, to, some, extent, in, most, cases, of, essential, hypertension, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, endothelial, dysfunction, and, vascular, inflammation, may, also, contribute, to, increased, peripheral, resistance, and, vascular, damage, in, hypertension, interleukin, 17, has, garnered, interest, for, its, role, in, increasing, the, production, of, several, other, immune, system, chemical, signals, thought, to, be, involved, in, hypertension, such, as, tumor, necrosis, factor, alpha, interleukin, 1, interleukin, 6, and, interleukin, 8, excessive, sodium, or, insufficient, potassium, in, the, diet, leads, to, excessive, intracellular, sodium, which, contracts, vascular, smooth, muscle, restricting, blood, flow, and, so, increases, blood, pressure, non, modulating, essential, hypertension, is, a, form, of, salt, sensitive, hypertension, where, sodium, intake, does, not, modulate, either, adrenal, or, renal, vascular, responses, to, angiotensin, ii, they, make, up, 25, of, the, hypertensive, population, hypertension, is, diagnosed, on, the, basis, of, a, persistently, high, resting, blood, pressure, elevated, blood, pressure, measurements, on, at, least, two, separate, occasions, is, required, for, a, diagnosis, of, hypertension, for, an, accurate, diagnosis, of, hypertension, to, be, made, it, is, essential, for, proper, blood, pressure, measurement, technique, to, be, used, improper, measurement, of, blood, pressure, is, common, and, can, change, the, blood, pressure, reading, by, up, to, 10, mmhg, which, can, lead, to, misdiagnosis, and, misclassification, of, hypertension, correct, blood, pressure, measurement, technique, involves, several, steps, proper, blood, pressure, measurement, requires, the, person, whose, blood, pressure, is, being, measured, to, sit, quietly, for, at, least, five, minutes, which, is, then, followed, by, application, of, a, properly, fitted, blood, pressure, cuff, to, a, bare, upper, arm, the, person, should, be, seated, with, their, back, supported, feet, flat, on, the, floor, and, with, their, legs, uncrossed, the, person, whose, blood, pressure, is, being, measured, should, avoid, talking, or, moving, during, this, process, the, arm, being, measured, should, be, supported, on, a, flat, surface, at, the, level, of, the, heart, blood, pressure, measurement, should, be, done, in, a, quiet, room, so, the, medical, professional, checking, the, blood, pressure, can, hear, the, korotkoff, sounds, while, listening, to, the, brachial, artery, with, a, stethoscope, for, accurate, blood, pressure, measurements, the, blood, pressure, cuff, should, be, deflated, slowly, 2, 3, mmhg, per, second, while, listening, for, the, korotkoff, sounds, the, bladder, should, be, emptied, before, a, person, s, blood, pressure, is, measured, since, this, can, increase, blood, pressure, by, up, to, 15, 10, mmhg, multiple, blood, pressure, readings, at, least, two, spaced, 1, 2, minutes, apart, should, be, obtained, to, ensure, accuracy, ambulatory, blood, pressure, monitoring, over, 12, to, 24, hours, is, the, most, accurate, method, to, confirm, the, diagnosis, an, exception, to, this, is, those, with, very, high, blood, pressure, readings, especially, when, there, is, poor, organ, function, with, the, availability, of, 24, hour, ambulatory, blood, pressure, monitors, and, home, blood, pressure, machines, the, importance, of, not, wrongly, diagnosing, those, who, have, white, coat, hypertension, has, led, to, a, change, in, protocols, in, the, united, kingdom, current, best, practice, is, to, follow, up, a, single, raised, clinic, reading, with, ambulatory, measurement, or, less, ideally, with, home, blood, pressure, monitoring, over, the, course, of, 7, days, the, united, states, preventive, services, task, force, also, recommends, getting, measurements, outside, of, the, healthcare, environment, pseudohypertension, in, the, elderly, or, noncompressibility, artery, syndrome, may, also, require, consideration, this, condition, is, believed, to, be, due, to, calcification, of, the, arteries, resulting, in, abnormally, high, blood, pressure, readings, with, a, blood, pressure, cuff, while, intra, arterial, measurements, of, blood, pressure, are, normal, orthostatic, hypertension, is, when, blood, pressure, increases, upon, standing, once, the, diagnosis, of, hypertension, has, been, made, further, testing, may, be, performed, to, find, secondary, hypertension, identify, comorbidities, such, as, diabetes, identify, hypertension, caused, organ, damage, such, as, chronic, kidney, disease, or, thickening, of, the, heart, muscle, and, for, cardiovascular, disease, risk, stratification, secondary, hypertension, is, more, common, in, preadolescent, children, with, most, cases, caused, by, kidney, disease, primary, or, essential, hypertension, is, more, common, in, adolescents, and, adults, and, has, multiple, risk, factors, including, obesity, and, a, family, history, of, hypertension, initial, assessment, upon, diagnosis, of, hypertension, should, include, a, complete, history, and, physical, examination, the, world, health, organization, suggests, the, following, initial, tests, serum, electrolytes, serum, creatinine, lipid, panel, hba1c, or, fasting, glucose, urine, dipstick, and, electrocardiogram, ecg, ekg, serum, creatinine, is, measured, to, assess, for, the, presence, of, kidney, disease, which, can, be, either, the, cause, or, the, result, of, hypertension, egfr, can, also, provide, a, baseline, measurement, of, kidney, function, that, can, be, used, to, monitor, for, side, effects, of, certain, anti, hypertensive, drugs, on, kidney, function, testing, of, urine, samples, for, protein, is, used, as, a, secondary, indicator, of, kidney, disease, lipid, panel, and, glucose, tests, are, done, to, identify, comorbidities, such, as, diabetes, and, hyperlipidemia, and, for, cardiovascular, risk, stratification, electrocardiogram, ekg, ecg, testing, is, done, to, check, for, evidence, that, the, heart, is, under, strain, from, high, blood, pressure, such, as, thickening, of, the, heart, muscle, or, whether, the, heart, has, experienced, a, prior, minor, disturbance, such, as, a, silent, heart, attack, blood, pressure, measurements, can, be, influenced, by, circumstances, of, measurement, guidelines, use, different, thresholds, for, office, also, known, as, clinic, home, when, the, patient, measures, their, own, blood, pressure, at, home, and, ambulatory, blood, pressure, using, an, automated, device, over, a, 24, hour, period, hypertension, occurs, in, around, 0, 2, to, 3, of, newborns, however, blood, pressure, is, not, measured, routinely, in, healthy, newborns, hypertension, is, more, common, in, high, risk, newborns, a, variety, of, factors, such, as, gestational, age, postconceptional, age, and, birth, weight, needs, to, be, taken, into, account, when, deciding, if, a, blood, pressure, is, normal, in, a, newborn, hypertension, defined, as, elevated, blood, pressure, over, several, visits, affects, 1, to, 5, of, children, and, adolescents, and, is, associated, with, long, term, risks, of, ill, health, blood, pressure, rises, with, age, in, childhood, and, in, children, hypertension, is, defined, as, an, average, systolic, or, diastolic, blood, pressure, on, three, or, more, occasions, equal, or, higher, than, the, 95th, percentile, appropriate, for, the, sex, age, and, height, of, the, child, high, blood, pressure, must, be, confirmed, on, repeated, visits, however, before, characterizing, a, child, as, having, hypertension, in, adolescents, it, has, been, proposed, that, hypertension, is, diagnosed, and, classified, using, the, same, criteria, as, in, adults, much, of, the, disease, burden, of, high, blood, pressure, is, experienced, by, people, who, are, not, labeled, as, hypertensive, consequently, population, strategies, are, required, to, reduce, the, consequences, of, high, blood, pressure, and, reduce, the, need, for, antihypertensive, medications, lifestyle, changes, are, recommended, to, lower, blood, pressure, recommended, lifestyle, changes, for, the, prevention, of, hypertension, include, effective, lifestyle, modification, may, lower, blood, pressure, as, much, as, an, individual, antihypertensive, medication, combinations, of, two, or, more, lifestyle, modifications, can, achieve, even, better, results, there, is, considerable, evidence, that, reducing, dietary, salt, intake, lowers, blood, pressure, but, whether, this, translates, into, a, reduction, in, mortality, and, cardiovascular, disease, remains, uncertain, estimated, sodium, intake, 6, g, day, and, 3, g, day, are, both, associated, with, high, risk, of, death, or, major, cardiovascular, disease, but, the, association, between, high, sodium, intake, and, adverse, outcomes, is, only, observed, in, people, with, hypertension, consequently, in, the, absence, of, results, from, randomized, controlled, trials, the, wisdom, of, reducing, levels, of, dietary, sodium, intake, below, 3, g, day, has, been, questioned, esc, guidelines, mention, periodontitis, is, associated, with, poor, cardiovascular, health, status, the, value, of, routine, screening, for, hypertension, is, debated, in, 2004, the, national, high, blood, pressure, education, program, recommended, that, children, aged, 3, years, and, older, have, blood, pressure, measurement, at, least, once, at, every, health, care, visit, and, the, national, heart, lung, and, blood, institute, and, american, academy, of, pediatrics, made, a, similar, recommendation, however, the, american, academy, of, family, physicians, supports, the, view, of, the, u, s, preventive, services, task, force, that, the, available, evidence, is, insufficient, to, determine, the, balance, of, benefits, and, harms, of, screening, for, hypertension, in, children, and, adolescents, who, do, not, have, symptoms, the, us, preventive, services, task, force, recommends, screening, adults, 18, years, or, older, for, hypertension, with, office, blood, pressure, measurement, according, to, one, review, published, in, 2003, reduction, of, the, blood, pressure, by, 5, mmhg, can, decrease, the, risk, of, stroke, by, 34, of, ischemic, heart, disease, by, 21, and, reduce, the, likelihood, of, dementia, heart, failure, and, mortality, from, cardiovascular, disease, various, expert, groups, have, produced, guidelines, regarding, how, low, the, blood, pressure, target, should, be, when, a, person, is, treated, for, hypertension, these, groups, recommend, a, target, below, the, range, 140, 160, 90, 100, mmhg, for, the, general, population, cochrane, reviews, recommend, similar, targets, for, subgroups, such, as, people, with, diabetes, and, people, with, prior, cardiovascular, disease, additionally, cochrane, reviews, have, found, that, for, older, individuals, with, moderate, to, high, cardiovascular, risk, the, benefits, of, trying, to, achieve, a, lower, than, standard, blood, pressure, target, at, or, below, 140, 90, mmhg, are, outweighed, by, the, risk, associated, with, the, intervention, these, findings, may, not, be, applicable, to, other, populations, many, expert, groups, recommend, a, slightly, higher, target, of, 150, 90, mmhg, for, those, over, somewhere, between, 60, and, 80, years, of, age, the, jnc, 8, and, american, college, of, physicians, recommend, the, target, of, 150, 90, mmhg, for, those, over, 60, years, of, age, but, some, experts, within, these, groups, disagree, with, this, recommendation, some, expert, groups, have, also, recommended, slightly, lower, targets, in, those, with, diabetes, or, chronic, kidney, disease, but, others, recommend, the, same, target, as, for, the, general, population, the, issue, of, what, is, the, best, target, and, whether, targets, should, differ, for, high, risk, individuals, is, unresolved, although, some, experts, propose, more, intensive, blood, pressure, lowering, than, advocated, in, some, guidelines, for, people, who, have, never, experienced, cardiovascular, disease, who, are, at, a, 10, year, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, of, less, than, 10, the, 2017, american, heart, association, guidelines, recommend, medications, if, the, systolic, blood, pressure, is, 140, mmhg, or, if, the, diastolic, bp, is, 90, mmhg, for, people, who, have, experienced, cardiovascular, disease, or, those, who, are, at, a, 10, year, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, of, greater, than, 10, it, recommends, medications, if, the, systolic, blood, pressure, is, 130, mmhg, or, if, the, diastolic, bp, is, 80, mmhg, the, first, line, of, treatment, for, hypertension, is, lifestyle, changes, including, dietary, changes, physical, activity, and, weight, loss, though, these, have, all, been, recommended, in, scientific, advisories, a, cochrane, systematic, review, found, no, evidence, due, to, lack, of, data, for, effects, of, weight, loss, diets, on, death, long, term, complications, or, adverse, events, in, persons, with, hypertension, the, review, did, find, a, decrease, in, body, weight, and, blood, pressure, their, potential, effectiveness, is, similar, to, and, at, times, exceeds, a, single, medication, if, hypertension, is, high, enough, to, justify, immediate, use, of, medications, lifestyle, changes, are, still, recommended, in, conjunction, with, medication, dietary, changes, shown, to, reduce, blood, pressure, include, diets, with, low, sodium, the, dash, diet, dietary, approaches, to, stop, hypertension, which, was, the, best, against, 11, other, diet, in, an, umbrella, review, and, plant, based, diets, a, 2024, clinical, guideline, recommended, an, increase, dietary, fiber, intake, with, a, minimum, of, 28g, day, for, women, and, 38g, day, for, men, diagnosed, with, hypertension, increasing, dietary, potassium, has, a, potential, benefit, for, lowering, the, risk, of, hypertension, the, 2015, dietary, guidelines, advisory, committee, dgac, stated, that, potassium, is, one, of, the, shortfall, nutrients, which, is, under, consumed, in, the, united, states, however, people, who, take, certain, antihypertensive, medications, such, as, ace, inhibitors, or, arbs, should, not, take, potassium, supplements, or, potassium, enriched, salts, due, to, the, risk, of, high, levels, of, potassium, physical, exercise, regimens, which, are, shown, to, reduce, blood, pressure, include, isometric, resistance, exercise, aerobic, exercise, resistance, exercise, and, device, guided, breathing, stress, reduction, techniques, such, as, biofeedback, or, transcendental, meditation, may, be, considered, as, an, add, on, to, other, treatments, to, reduce, hypertension, but, do, not, have, evidence, for, preventing, cardiovascular, disease, on, their, own, self, monitoring, and, appointment, reminders, might, support, the, use, of, other, strategies, to, improve, blood, pressure, control, but, need, further, evaluation, several, classes, of, medications, collectively, referred, to, as, antihypertensive, medications, are, available, for, treating, hypertension, first, line, medications, for, hypertension, include, thiazide, diuretics, calcium, channel, blockers, angiotensin, converting, enzyme, inhibitors, ace, inhibitors, and, angiotensin, receptor, blockers, arbs, these, medications, may, be, used, alone, or, in, combination, ace, inhibitors, and, arbs, are, not, recommended, for, use, together, the, latter, option, may, serve, to, minimize, counter, regulatory, mechanisms, that, act, to, restore, blood, pressure, values, to, pre, treatment, levels, although, the, evidence, for, first, line, combination, therapy, is, not, strong, enough, most, people, require, more, than, one, medication, to, control, their, hypertension, medications, for, blood, pressure, control, should, be, implemented, by, a, stepped, care, approach, when, target, levels, are, not, reached, withdrawal, of, such, medications, in, the, elderly, can, be, considered, by, healthcare, professionals, because, there, is, no, strong, evidence, of, an, effect, on, mortality, myocardial, infarction, or, stroke, previously, beta, blockers, such, as, atenolol, were, thought, to, have, similar, beneficial, effects, when, used, as, first, line, therapy, for, hypertension, however, a, cochrane, review, that, included, 13, trials, found, that, the, effects, of, beta, blockers, are, inferior, to, that, of, other, antihypertensive, medications, in, preventing, cardiovascular, disease, the, prescription, of, antihypertensive, medication, for, children, with, hypertension, has, limited, evidence, there, is, limited, evidence, which, compare, it, with, placebo, and, shows, modest, effect, to, blood, pressure, in, short, term, administration, of, higher, dose, did, not, make, the, reduction, of, blood, pressure, greater, resistant, hypertension, is, defined, as, high, blood, pressure, that, remains, above, a, target, level, in, spite, of, being, prescribed, three, or, more, antihypertensive, drugs, simultaneously, with, different, mechanisms, of, action, failing, to, take, prescribed, medications, as, directed, is, an, important, cause, of, resistant, hypertension, some, common, secondary, causes, of, resistant, hypertension, include, obstructive, sleep, apnea, primary, aldosteronism, and, renal, artery, stenosis, and, some, rare, secondary, causes, are, pheochromocytoma, and, coarctation, of, the, aorta, as, many, as, one, in, five, people, with, resistant, hypertension, have, primary, aldosteronism, which, is, a, treatable, and, sometimes, curable, condition, resistant, hypertension, may, also, result, from, chronically, high, activity, of, the, autonomic, nervous, system, an, effect, known, as, neurogenic, hypertension, electrical, therapies, that, stimulate, the, baroreflex, are, being, studied, as, an, option, for, lowering, blood, pressure, in, people, in, this, situation, refractory, hypertension, is, described, by, one, source, as, elevated, blood, pressure, unmitigated, by, five, or, more, concurrent, antihypertensive, agents, of, different, classes, people, with, refractory, hypertension, typically, have, increased, sympathetic, nervous, system, activity, and, are, at, high, risk, for, more, severe, cardiovascular, diseases, and, all, cause, mortality, as, of, 2019, one, in, three, or, 33, of, the, world, population, were, estimated, to, have, hypertension, of, all, people, with, hypertension, about, 46, do, not, have, a, diagnosis, of, hypertension, and, are, unaware, that, they, have, the, condition, in, 1975, almost, 600, million, people, had, a, diagnosis, of, hypertension, a, number, which, increased, to, 1, 13, billion, by, 2015, mostly, due, to, risk, factors, for, hypertension, increasing, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, hypertension, is, slightly, more, frequent, in, men, in, people, aged, under, 50, years, more, men, than, women, have, hypertension, and, in, ages, above, 50, years, the, prevalence, of, hypertension, is, the, same, in, men, and, women, in, ages, above, 65, years, more, women, than, men, have, hypertension, hypertension, becomes, more, common, with, age, hypertension, is, common, in, high, medium, and, low, income, countries, it, is, more, common, in, people, of, low, socioeconomic, status, hypertension, is, around, twice, as, common, in, diabetics, in, 2019, rates, of, diagnosed, hypertension, were, highest, in, africa, 30, for, both, sexes, and, lowest, in, the, americas, 18, for, both, sexes, rates, also, vary, markedly, within, regions, with, country, level, rates, as, low, as, 22, 8, men, and, 18, 4, women, in, peru, and, as, high, as, 61, 6, men, and, 50, 9, women, in, paraguay, in, 1995, it, was, estimated, that, 24, of, the, united, states, population, had, hypertension, or, were, taking, antihypertensive, medication, by, 2004, this, had, increased, to, 29, and, further, to, 32, 76, million, us, adults, by, 2017, in, 2017, with, the, american, guidelines, change, in, definition, for, hypertension, 46, of, people, in, the, united, states, are, affected, african, american, adults, in, the, united, states, have, among, the, highest, rates, of, hypertension, in, the, world, at, 44, differences, in, hypertension, rates, are, multifactorial, and, under, study, rates, of, high, blood, pressure, in, children, and, adolescents, have, increased, in, the, last, 20, years, in, the, united, states, childhood, hypertension, particularly, in, pre, adolescents, is, more, often, secondary, to, an, underlying, disorder, than, in, adults, kidney, disease, is, the, most, common, secondary, cause, of, hypertension, in, children, and, adolescents, nevertheless, primary, or, essential, hypertension, accounts, for, most, cases, hypertension, is, the, most, important, preventable, risk, factor, for, premature, death, worldwide, it, increases, the, risk, of, ischemic, heart, disease, stroke, peripheral, vascular, disease, and, other, cardiovascular, diseases, including, heart, failure, aortic, aneurysms, diffuse, atherosclerosis, chronic, kidney, disease, atrial, fibrillation, cancers, leukemia, and, pulmonary, embolism, hypertension, is, also, a, risk, factor, for, cognitive, impairment, and, dementia, other, complications, include, hypertensive, retinopathy, and, hypertensive, nephropathy, modern, understanding, of, the, cardiovascular, system, began, with, the, work, of, physician, william, harvey, 1578, 1657, who, described, the, circulation, of, blood, in, his, book, de, motu, cordis, the, english, clergyman, stephen, hales, made, the, first, published, measurement, of, blood, pressure, in, 1733, however, hypertension, as, a, clinical, entity, came, into, its, own, with, the, invention, of, the, cuff, based, sphygmomanometer, by, scipione, riva, rocci, in, 1896, this, allowed, easy, measurement, of, systolic, pressure, in, the, clinic, in, 1905, nikolai, korotkoff, improved, the, technique, by, describing, the, korotkoff, sounds, that, are, heard, when, the, artery, is, ausculted, with, a, stethoscope, while, the, sphygmomanometer, cuff, is, deflated, this, permitted, systolic, and, diastolic, pressure, to, be, measured, the, symptoms, similar, to, symptoms, of, patients, with, hypertensive, crisis, are, discussed, in, medieval, persian, medical, texts, in, the, chapter, of, fullness, disease, the, symptoms, include, headache, heaviness, in, the, head, sluggish, movements, general, redness, and, warm, to, touch, feel, of, the, body, prominent, distended, and, tense, vessels, fullness, of, the, pulse, distension, of, the, skin, coloured, and, dense, urine, loss, of, appetite, weak, eyesight, impairment, of, thinking, yawning, drowsiness, vascular, rupture, and, hemorrhagic, stroke, fullness, disease, was, presumed, to, be, due, to, an, excessive, amount, of, blood, within, the, blood, vessels, descriptions, of, hypertension, as, a, disease, came, among, others, from, thomas, young, in, 1808, and, especially, richard, bright, in, 1836, the, first, report, of, elevated, blood, pressure, in, a, person, without, evidence, of, kidney, disease, was, made, by, frederick, akbar, mahomed, 1849, 1884, until, the, 1990s, systolic, hypertension, was, defined, as, systolic, blood, pressure, of, 160, mm, hg, or, greater, in, 1993, the, who, ish, guidelines, defined, 140, mmhg, as, the, threshold, for, hypertension, historically, the, treatment, for, what, was, called, the, hard, pulse, disease, consisted, in, reducing, the, quantity, of, blood, by, bloodletting, or, the, application, of, leeches, this, was, advocated, by, the, yellow, emperor, of, china, cornelius, celsus, galen, and, hippocrates, the, therapeutic, approach, for, the, treatment, of, hard, pulse, disease, included, changes, in, lifestyle, staying, away, from, anger, and, sexual, intercourse, and, dietary, program, for, patients, avoiding, the, consumption, of, wine, meat, and, pastries, reducing, the, volume, of, food, in, a, meal, maintaining, a, low, energy, diet, and, the, dietary, usage, of, spinach, and, vinegar, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, before, effective, pharmacological, treatment, for, hypertension, became, possible, three, treatment, modalities, were, used, all, with, numerous, side, effects, strict, sodium, restriction, for, example, the, rice, diet, sympathectomy, surgical, ablation, of, parts, of, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, and, pyrogen, therapy, injection, of, substances, that, caused, a, fever, indirectly, reducing, blood, pressure, the, first, chemical, for, hypertension, sodium, thiocyanate, was, used, in, 1900, but, had, many, side, effects, and, was, unpopular, several, other, agents, were, developed, after, the, second, world, war, the, most, popular, and, reasonably, effective, of, which, were, tetramethylammonium, chloride, hexamethonium, hydralazine, and, reserpine, derived, from, the, medicinal, plant, rauvolfia, serpentina, none, of, these, were, well, tolerated, a, major, breakthrough, was, achieved, with, the, discovery, of, the, first, well, tolerated, orally, available, agents, the, first, was, chlorothiazide, the, first, thiazide, diuretic, and, developed, from, the, antibiotic, sulfanilamide, which, became, available, in, 1958, subsequently, beta, blockers, calcium, channel, blockers, angiotensin, converting, enzyme, ace, inhibitors, angiotensin, receptor, blockers, and, renin, inhibitors, were, developed, as, antihypertensive, agents, the, world, health, organization, has, identified, hypertension, high, blood, pressure, as, the, leading, cause, of, cardiovascular, mortality, the, world, hypertension, league, whl, an, umbrella, organization, of, 85, national, hypertension, societies, and, leagues, recognized, that, more, than, 50, of, the, hypertensive, population, worldwide, are, unaware, of, their, condition, to, address, this, problem, the, whl, initiated, a, global, awareness, campaign, on, hypertension, in, 2005, and, dedicated, 17, may, of, each, year, as, world, hypertension, day, high, blood, pressure, is, the, most, common, chronic, medical, problem, prompting, visits, to, primary, health, care, providers, in, us, the, american, heart, association, estimated, the, direct, and, indirect, costs, of, high, blood, pressure, in, 2010, as, 76, 6, billion, in, the, us, 80, of, people, with, hypertension, are, aware, of, their, condition, 71, take, some, antihypertensive, medication, but, only, 48, of, people, aware, that, they, have, hypertension, adequately, control, it, adequate, management, of, hypertension, can, be, hampered, by, inadequacies, in, the, diagnosis, treatment, or, control, of, high, blood, pressure, health, care, providers, face, many, obstacles, to, achieving, blood, pressure, control, including, resistance, to, taking, multiple, medications, to, reach, blood, pressure, goals, people, also, face, the, challenges, of, adhering, to, medicine, schedules, and, making, lifestyle, changes, nonetheless, the, achievement, of, blood, pressure, goals, is, possible, and, most, importantly, lowering, blood, pressure, significantly, reduces, the, risk, of, death, due, to, heart, disease, and, stroke, the, development, of, other, debilitating, conditions, and, the, cost, associated, with, advanced, medical, care, hypertension, in, cats, is, indicated, with, a, systolic, blood, pressure, greater, than, 150, mmhg, with, amlodipine, the, usual, first, line, treatment, a, cat, with, a, systolic, blood, pressure, above, 170, mmhg, is, considered, hypertensive, if, a, cat, has, other, problems, such, as, any, kidney, disease, or, retina, detachment, then, a, blood, pressure, below, 160, mmhg, may, also, need, to, be, monitored, normal, blood, pressure, in, dogs, can, differ, substantially, between, breeds, but, hypertension, is, often, diagnosed, if, systolic, blood, pressure, is, above, 160, mmhg, particularly, if, this, is, associated, with, target, organ, damage, inhibitors, of, the, renin, angiotensin, system, and, calcium, channel, blockers, are, often, used, to, treat, hypertension, in, dogs, although, other, drugs, may, be, indicated, for, specific, conditions, causing, high, blood, pressure
