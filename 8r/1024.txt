an, apple, is, a, round, edible, fruit, produced, by, an, apple, tree, malus, spp, among, them, the, domestic, or, orchard, apple, malus, domestica, apple, trees, are, cultivated, worldwide, and, are, the, most, widely, grown, species, in, the, genus, malus, the, tree, originated, in, central, asia, where, its, wild, ancestor, malus, sieversii, is, still, found, apples, have, been, grown, for, thousands, of, years, in, eurasia, and, were, introduced, to, north, america, by, european, colonists, apples, have, religious, and, mythological, significance, in, many, cultures, including, norse, greek, and, european, christian, tradition, apples, grown, from, seed, tend, to, be, very, different, from, those, of, their, parents, and, the, resultant, fruit, frequently, lacks, desired, characteristics, for, commercial, purposes, including, botanical, evaluation, apple, cultivars, are, propagated, by, clonal, grafting, onto, rootstocks, apple, trees, grown, without, rootstocks, tend, to, be, larger, and, much, slower, to, fruit, after, planting, rootstocks, are, used, to, control, the, speed, of, growth, and, the, size, of, the, resulting, tree, allowing, for, easier, harvesting, there, are, more, than, 7, 500, cultivars, of, apples, different, cultivars, are, bred, for, various, tastes, and, uses, including, cooking, eating, raw, and, cider, or, apple, juice, production, trees, and, fruit, are, prone, to, fungal, bacterial, and, pest, problems, which, can, be, controlled, by, a, number, of, organic, and, non, organic, means, in, 2010, the, fruit, s, genome, was, sequenced, as, part, of, research, on, disease, control, and, selective, breeding, in, apple, production, the, word, apple, whose, old, english, ancestor, is, ppel, is, descended, from, the, proto, germanic, noun, aplaz, descended, in, turn, from, proto, indo, european, h, b, l, as, late, as, the, 17th, century, the, word, also, functioned, as, a, generic, term, for, all, fruit, including, nuts, this, can, be, compared, to, the, 14th, century, middle, english, expression, appel, of, paradis, meaning, a, banana, the, apple, is, a, deciduous, tree, generally, standing, 2, to, 4, 5, metres, 6, to, 15, feet, tall, in, cultivation, and, up, to, 15, m, 49, ft, in, the, wild, though, more, typically, 2, to, 10, m, 6, 5, to, 33, ft, when, cultivated, the, size, shape, and, branch, density, are, determined, by, rootstock, selection, and, trimming, method, apple, trees, may, naturally, have, a, rounded, to, erect, crown, with, a, dense, canopy, of, leaves, the, bark, of, the, trunk, is, dark, gray, or, gray, brown, but, young, branches, are, reddish, or, dark, brown, with, a, smooth, texture, when, young, twigs, are, covered, in, very, fine, downy, hairs, and, become, hairless, as, they, become, older, the, buds, are, egg, shaped, and, dark, red, or, purple, in, color, and, range, in, size, from, 3, to, 5, millimeters, but, usually, less, than, 4, mm, the, bud, scales, have, very, hairy, edges, when, emerging, from, the, buds, the, leaves, are, convolute, that, is, their, edges, overlap, each, other, the, shape, is, ranges, from, simple, ovals, elliptic, medium, or, wide, in, width, somewhat, egg, shaped, with, the, wider, portion, toward, their, base, ovate, or, even, with, sides, that, are, more, parallel, to, each, other, instead, of, curved, oblong, with, a, narrow, pointed, end, the, edges, have, broadly, angled, teeth, but, do, not, have, lobes, the, top, surface, of, the, leaves, are, glabrescent, almost, hairless, while, the, undersides, are, densely, covered, in, fine, hairs, the, leaves, are, attached, alternately, by, short, leaf, stems, 1, to, 3, 5, cm, 1, 2, to, 1, 1, 2, in, long, blossoms, are, produced, in, spring, simultaneously, with, the, budding, of, the, leaves, and, are, produced, on, spurs, and, some, long, shoots, when, the, flower, buds, first, begin, to, open, the, petals, are, rose, pink, and, fade, to, white, or, light, pink, when, fully, open, with, each, flower, 3, to, 4, centimeter, 1, to, 1, 1, 2, inch, in, diameter, the, five, petaled, flowers, are, group, in, an, inflorescence, consisting, of, a, cyme, with, 4, 6, flowers, the, central, flower, of, the, inflorescence, is, called, the, king, bloom, it, opens, first, and, can, develop, a, larger, fruit, the, fruit, is, a, pome, that, matures, in, late, summer, or, autumn, the, true, fruits, or, carpels, are, the, harder, interior, chambers, inside, the, apple, s, core, there, are, usually, five, carpels, inside, an, apple, but, there, may, be, as, few, as, three, each, of, the, chambers, contains, one, or, two, seeds, the, edible, flesh, is, formed, from, the, receptacle, at, the, base, of, the, flower, the, seeds, are, egg, to, pear, shaped, and, may, be, colored, from, light, brown, or, tan, to, a, very, dark, brown, often, with, red, shades, or, even, purplish, black, they, may, have, a, blunt, or, sharp, point, the, five, sepals, remain, attached, and, stand, out, from, the, surface, of, the, apple, the, size, of, the, fruit, varies, widely, between, cultivars, but, generally, has, a, diameter, between, 2, 5, and, 12, cm, 1, and, 4, 3, 4, in, the, shape, is, quite, variable, and, may, be, nearly, round, elongated, conical, or, short, and, wide, the, groundcolor, of, ripe, apples, is, yellow, green, yellow, green, or, whitish, yellow, the, overcolor, of, ripe, apples, can, be, orange, red, pink, red, red, purple, red, or, brown, red, the, overcolor, amount, can, be, 0, 100, the, skin, may, be, wholly, or, partly, russeted, making, it, rough, and, brown, the, skin, is, covered, in, a, protective, layer, of, epicuticular, wax, the, skin, may, also, be, marked, with, scattered, dots, the, flesh, is, generally, pale, yellowish, white, though, it, can, be, pink, yellow, or, green, important, volatile, compounds, in, apples, that, contribute, to, their, scent, and, flavour, include, acetaldehyde, ethyl, acetate, 1, butanal, ethanol, 2, methylbutanal, 3, methylbutanal, ethyl, propionate, ethyl, 2, methylpropionate, ethyl, butyrate, ethyl, 2, methyl, butyrate, hexanal, 1, butanol, 3, methylbutyl, acetate, 2, methylbutyl, acetate, 1, propyl, butyrate, ethyl, pentanoate, amyl, acetate, 2, methyl, 1, butanol, trans, 2, hexenal, ethyl, hexanoate, hexanol, the, apple, as, a, species, has, more, than, 100, alternative, scientific, names, or, synonyms, in, modern, times, malus, pumila, and, malus, domestica, are, the, two, main, names, in, use, m, pumila, is, the, older, name, but, m, domestica, has, become, much, more, commonly, used, starting, in, the, 21st, century, especially, in, the, western, world, two, proposals, were, made, to, make, m, domestica, a, conserved, name, the, earlier, proposal, was, voted, down, by, the, committee, for, vascular, plants, of, the, iapt, in, 2014, but, in, april, 2017, the, committee, decided, with, a, narrow, majority, that, the, newly, popular, name, should, be, conserved, the, general, committee, of, the, iapt, decided, in, june, 2017, to, approve, this, change, officially, conserving, m, domestica, nevertheless, some, works, published, after, 2017, still, use, m, pumila, as, the, correct, name, under, an, alternate, taxonomy, when, first, classified, by, linnaeus, in, 1753, the, pears, apples, and, quinces, were, combined, into, one, genus, that, he, named, pyrus, and, he, named, the, apple, as, pyrus, malus, this, was, widely, accepted, however, the, botanist, philip, miller, published, an, alternate, classification, in, the, gardeners, dictionary, with, the, apple, species, separated, from, pyrus, in, 1754, he, did, not, clearly, indicate, that, by, malus, pumila, he, meant, the, domesticated, apple, nonetheless, it, was, used, as, such, by, many, botanists, when, moritz, balthasar, borkhausen, published, his, scientific, description, of, the, apple, in, 1803, it, may, have, been, a, new, combination, of, p, malus, var, domestica, but, this, was, not, directly, referenced, by, borkhausen, the, earliest, use, of, var, domestica, for, the, apple, was, by, georg, adolf, suckow, in, 1786, apples, are, diploid, with, two, sets, of, chromosomes, per, cell, though, triploid, cultivars, with, three, sets, are, not, uncommon, have, 17, chromosomes, and, an, estimated, genome, size, of, approximately, 650, mb, several, whole, genome, sequences, have, been, completed, and, made, available, the, first, one, in, 2010, was, based, on, the, diploid, cultivar, golden, delicious, however, this, first, whole, genome, sequence, contained, several, errors, in, part, owing, to, the, high, degree, of, heterozygosity, in, diploid, apples, which, in, combination, with, an, ancient, genome, duplication, complicated, the, assembly, recently, double, and, trihaploid, individuals, have, been, sequenced, yielding, whole, genome, sequences, of, higher, quality, the, first, whole, genome, assembly, was, estimated, to, contain, around, 57, 000, genes, though, the, more, recent, genome, sequences, support, estimates, between, 42, 000, and, 44, 700, protein, coding, genes, the, availability, of, whole, genome, sequences, has, provided, evidence, that, the, wild, ancestor, of, the, cultivated, apple, most, likely, is, malus, sieversii, re, sequencing, of, multiple, accessions, has, supported, this, while, also, suggesting, extensive, introgression, from, malus, sylvestris, following, domestication, central, asia, is, generally, considered, the, center, of, origin, for, apples, due, to, the, genetic, variability, in, specimens, there, the, wild, ancestor, of, malus, domestica, was, malus, sieversii, found, growing, wild, in, the, mountains, of, central, asia, in, southern, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, tajikistan, and, northwestern, china, cultivation, of, the, species, most, likely, beginning, on, the, forested, flanks, of, the, tian, shan, mountains, progressed, over, a, long, period, of, time, and, permitted, secondary, introgression, of, genes, from, other, species, into, the, open, pollinated, seeds, significant, exchange, with, malus, sylvestris, the, crabapple, resulted, in, populations, of, apples, being, more, related, to, crabapples, than, to, the, more, morphologically, similar, progenitor, malus, sieversii, in, strains, without, recent, admixture, the, contribution, of, the, latter, predominates, the, apple, is, thought, to, have, been, domesticated, 4, 000, 10, 000, years, ago, in, the, tian, shan, mountains, and, then, to, have, travelled, along, the, silk, road, to, europe, with, hybridization, and, introgression, of, wild, crabapples, from, siberia, m, baccata, the, caucasus, m, orientalis, and, europe, m, sylvestris, only, the, m, sieversii, trees, growing, on, the, western, side, of, the, tian, shan, mountains, contributed, genetically, to, the, domesticated, apple, not, the, isolated, population, on, the, eastern, side, chinese, soft, apples, such, as, m, asiatica, and, m, prunifolia, have, been, cultivated, as, dessert, apples, for, more, than, 2, 000, years, in, china, these, are, thought, to, be, hybrids, between, m, baccata, and, m, sieversii, in, kazakhstan, among, the, traits, selected, for, by, human, growers, are, size, fruit, acidity, color, firmness, and, soluble, sugar, unusually, for, domesticated, fruits, the, wild, m, sieversii, origin, is, only, slightly, smaller, than, the, modern, domesticated, apple, at, the, sammardenchia, cueis, site, near, udine, in, northeastern, italy, seeds, from, some, form, of, apples, have, been, found, in, material, carbon, dated, to, between, 6570, and, 5684, bce, genetic, analysis, has, not, yet, been, successfully, used, to, determine, whether, such, ancient, apples, were, wild, malus, sylvestris, or, malus, domesticus, containing, malus, sieversii, ancestry, it, is, hard, to, distinguish, in, the, archeological, record, between, foraged, wild, apples, and, apple, plantations, there, is, indirect, evidence, of, apple, cultivation, in, the, third, millennium, bce, in, the, middle, east, there, was, substantial, apple, production, in, european, classical, antiquity, and, grafting, was, certainly, known, then, grafting, is, an, essential, part, of, modern, domesticated, apple, production, to, be, able, to, propagate, the, best, cultivars, it, is, unclear, when, apple, tree, grafting, was, invented, the, roman, writer, pliny, the, elder, describes, a, method, of, storage, for, apples, from, his, time, in, the, 1st, century, he, says, they, should, be, placed, in, a, room, with, good, air, circulation, from, a, north, facing, window, on, a, bed, of, straw, chaff, or, mats, with, windfalls, kept, separately, though, methods, like, this, will, extend, the, availabity, of, reasonably, fresh, apples, without, refrigeration, their, lifespan, is, limited, even, sturdy, winter, apple, varieties, will, only, keep, well, until, december, in, cool, climates, for, longer, storage, medieval, europeans, strung, up, cored, and, peeled, apples, to, dry, either, whole, or, sliced, into, rings, of, the, many, old, world, plants, that, the, spanish, introduced, to, chilo, archipelago, in, the, 16th, century, apple, trees, became, particularly, well, adapted, apples, were, introduced, to, north, america, by, colonists, in, the, 17th, century, and, the, first, named, apple, cultivar, was, introduced, in, boston, by, reverend, william, blaxton, in, 1640, the, only, apples, native, to, north, america, are, crab, apples, apple, cultivars, brought, as, seed, from, europe, were, spread, along, native, american, trade, routes, as, well, as, being, cultivated, on, colonial, farms, an, 1845, united, states, apples, nursery, catalogue, sold, 350, of, the, best, cultivars, showing, the, proliferation, of, new, north, american, cultivars, by, the, early, 19th, century, in, the, 20th, century, irrigation, projects, in, eastern, washington, began, and, allowed, the, development, of, the, multibillion, dollar, fruit, industry, of, which, the, apple, is, the, leading, product, until, the, 20th, century, farmers, stored, apples, in, frostproof, cellars, during, the, winter, for, their, own, use, or, for, sale, improved, transportation, of, fresh, apples, by, train, and, road, replaced, the, necessity, for, storage, controlled, atmosphere, facilities, are, used, to, keep, apples, fresh, year, round, controlled, atmosphere, facilities, use, high, humidity, low, oxygen, and, controlled, carbon, dioxide, levels, to, maintain, fruit, freshness, they, were, first, researched, at, cambridge, university, in, the, 1920s, and, first, used, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1950s, many, apples, grow, readily, from, seeds, however, apples, must, be, propagated, asexually, to, obtain, cuttings, with, the, characteristics, of, the, parent, this, is, because, seedling, apples, are, extreme, heterozygotes, rather, than, resembling, their, parents, seedlings, are, all, different, from, each, other, and, from, their, parents, triploid, cultivars, have, an, additional, reproductive, barrier, in, that, three, sets, of, chromosomes, cannot, be, divided, evenly, during, meiosis, yielding, unequal, segregation, of, the, chromosomes, aneuploids, even, in, the, case, when, a, triploid, plant, can, produce, a, seed, apples, are, an, example, it, occurs, infrequently, and, seedlings, rarely, survive, because, apples, are, not, true, breeders, when, planted, as, seeds, propagation, usually, involves, grafting, of, cuttings, the, rootstock, used, for, the, bottom, of, the, graft, can, be, selected, to, produce, trees, of, a, large, variety, of, sizes, as, well, as, changing, the, winter, hardiness, insect, and, disease, resistance, and, soil, preference, of, the, resulting, tree, dwarf, rootstocks, can, be, used, to, produce, very, small, trees, less, than, 3, 0, m, or, 10, ft, high, at, maturity, which, bear, fruit, many, years, earlier, in, their, life, cycle, than, full, size, trees, and, are, easier, to, harvest, dwarf, rootstocks, for, apple, trees, can, be, traced, as, far, back, as, 300, bce, to, the, area, of, persia, and, asia, minor, alexander, the, great, sent, samples, of, dwarf, apple, trees, to, aristotle, s, lyceum, dwarf, rootstocks, became, common, by, the, 15th, century, and, later, went, through, several, cycles, of, popularity, and, decline, throughout, the, world, the, majority, of, the, rootstocks, used, to, control, size, in, apples, were, developed, in, england, in, the, early, 1900s, the, east, malling, research, station, conducted, extensive, research, into, rootstocks, and, their, rootstocks, are, given, an, m, prefix, to, designate, their, origin, rootstocks, marked, with, an, mm, prefix, are, malling, series, cultivars, later, crossed, with, trees, of, northern, spy, in, merton, england, most, new, apple, cultivars, originate, as, seedlings, which, either, arise, by, chance, or, are, bred, by, deliberately, crossing, cultivars, with, promising, characteristics, the, words, seedling, pippin, and, kernel, in, the, name, of, an, apple, cultivar, suggest, that, it, originated, as, a, seedling, apples, can, also, form, bud, sports, mutations, on, a, single, branch, some, bud, sports, turn, out, to, be, improved, strains, of, the, parent, cultivar, some, differ, sufficiently, from, the, parent, tree, to, be, considered, new, cultivars, apples, have, been, acclimatized, in, ecuador, at, very, high, altitudes, where, they, can, often, with, the, needed, factors, provide, crops, twice, per, year, because, of, constant, temperate, conditions, year, round, apples, are, self, incompatible, they, must, cross, pollinate, to, develop, fruit, during, the, flowering, each, season, apple, growers, often, utilize, pollinators, to, carry, pollen, honey, bees, are, most, commonly, used, orchard, mason, bees, are, also, used, as, supplemental, pollinators, in, commercial, orchards, bumblebee, queens, are, sometimes, present, in, orchards, but, not, usually, in, sufficient, number, to, be, significant, pollinators, cultivars, are, sometimes, classified, by, the, day, of, peak, bloom, in, the, average, 30, day, blossom, period, with, pollinizers, selected, from, cultivars, within, a, 6, day, overlap, period, there, are, four, to, seven, pollination, groups, in, apples, depending, on, climate, one, cultivar, can, be, pollinated, by, a, compatible, cultivar, from, the, same, group, or, close, a, with, a, or, a, with, b, but, not, a, with, c, or, d, cultivars, vary, in, their, yield, and, the, ultimate, size, of, the, tree, even, when, grown, on, the, same, rootstock, some, cultivars, if, left, unpruned, grow, very, large, letting, them, bear, more, fruit, but, making, harvesting, more, difficult, depending, on, tree, density, number, of, trees, planted, per, unit, surface, area, mature, trees, typically, bear, 40, 200, kg, 90, 440, lb, of, apples, each, year, though, productivity, can, be, close, to, zero, in, poor, years, apples, are, harvested, using, three, point, ladders, that, are, designed, to, fit, amongst, the, branches, trees, grafted, on, dwarfing, rootstocks, bear, about, 10, 80, kg, 20, 180, lb, of, fruit, per, year, some, farms, with, apple, orchards, open, them, to, the, public, so, consumers, can, pick, their, own, apples, crops, ripen, at, different, times, of, the, year, according, to, the, cultivar, cultivar, that, yield, their, crop, in, the, summer, include, sweet, bough, and, duchess, fall, producers, include, blenheim, winter, producers, include, king, swayzie, and, tolman, sweet, commercially, apples, can, be, stored, for, months, in, controlled, atmosphere, chambers, apples, are, commonly, stored, in, chambers, with, lowered, concentrations, of, oxygen, to, reduce, respiration, and, slow, softening, and, other, changes, if, the, fruit, is, already, fully, ripe, the, gas, ethylene, is, used, by, plants, as, a, hormone, which, promotes, ripening, decreasing, the, time, an, apple, can, be, stored, for, storage, longer, than, about, six, months, the, apples, are, picked, earlier, before, full, ripeness, when, ethylene, production, by, the, fruit, is, low, however, in, many, varieties, this, increases, their, sensitivity, to, carbon, dioxide, which, also, must, be, controlled, for, home, storage, most, cultivars, of, apple, can, be, held, for, approximately, two, weeks, when, kept, at, the, coolest, part, of, the, refrigerator, i, e, below, 5, c, some, varieties, of, apples, e, g, granny, smith, and, fuji, have, more, than, three, times, the, storage, life, of, others, non, organic, apples, may, be, sprayed, with, a, substance, 1, methylcyclopropene, blocking, the, apples, ethylene, receptors, temporarily, preventing, them, from, ripening, apple, trees, are, susceptible, to, fungal, and, bacterial, diseases, and, to, damage, by, insect, pests, many, commercial, orchards, pursue, a, program, of, chemical, sprays, to, maintain, high, fruit, quality, tree, health, and, high, yields, these, prohibit, the, use, of, synthetic, pesticides, though, some, older, pesticides, are, allowed, organic, methods, include, for, instance, introducing, its, natural, predator, to, reduce, the, population, of, a, particular, pest, a, wide, range, of, pests, and, diseases, can, affect, the, plant, three, of, the, more, common, diseases, or, pests, are, mildew, aphids, and, apple, scab, among, the, most, serious, disease, problems, is, a, bacterial, disease, called, fireblight, and, three, fungal, diseases, gymnosporangium, rust, black, spot, and, bitter, rot, codling, moths, and, the, apple, maggots, of, fruit, flies, cause, serious, damage, to, apple, fruits, making, them, unsaleable, young, apple, trees, are, also, prone, to, mammal, pests, like, mice, and, deer, which, feed, on, the, soft, bark, of, the, trees, especially, in, winter, the, larvae, of, the, apple, clearwing, moth, red, belted, clearwing, burrow, through, the, bark, and, into, the, phloem, of, apple, trees, potentially, causing, significant, damage, there, are, more, than, 7, 500, known, cultivars, cultivated, varieties, of, apples, cultivars, vary, in, their, yield, and, the, ultimate, size, of, the, tree, even, when, grown, on, the, same, rootstock, different, cultivars, are, available, for, temperate, and, subtropical, climates, the, uk, s, national, fruit, collection, which, is, the, responsibility, of, the, department, of, environment, food, and, rural, affairs, includes, a, collection, of, over, 2, 000, cultivars, of, apple, tree, in, kent, the, university, of, reading, which, is, responsible, for, developing, the, uk, national, collection, database, provides, access, to, search, the, national, collection, the, university, of, reading, s, work, is, part, of, the, european, cooperative, programme, for, plant, genetic, resources, of, which, there, are, 38, countries, participating, in, the, malus, pyrus, work, group, the, uk, s, national, fruit, collection, database, contains, much, information, on, the, characteristics, and, origin, of, many, apples, including, alternative, names, for, what, is, essentially, the, same, genetic, apple, cultivar, most, of, these, cultivars, are, bred, for, eating, fresh, dessert, apples, though, some, are, cultivated, specifically, for, cooking, cooking, apples, or, producing, cider, cider, apples, are, typically, too, tart, and, astringent, to, eat, fresh, but, they, give, the, beverage, a, rich, flavor, that, dessert, apples, cannot, in, the, united, states, there, are, many, apple, breeding, programs, associated, with, universities, cornell, university, has, had, a, program, operating, since, 1880, in, geneva, new, york, among, their, recent, well, known, apples, is, the, snapdragon, cultivar, released, in, 2013, in, the, west, washington, state, university, started, a, program, to, support, their, apple, industry, in, 1994, and, released, the, cosmic, crisp, cultivar, in, 2017, the, third, most, grown, apple, cultivar, in, the, united, states, is, the, honeycrisp, released, by, the, university, of, minnesota, program, in, 1991, unusually, for, a, popular, cultivar, the, honeycrisp, is, not, directly, related, to, another, popular, apple, cultivar, but, instead, to, two, unsuccessful, cultivars, in, europe, there, are, also, many, breeding, programs, such, as, the, julius, k, hn, institut, the, german, federal, research, center, for, cultivated, plants, commercially, popular, apple, cultivars, are, soft, but, crisp, other, desirable, qualities, in, modern, commercial, apple, breeding, are, a, colorful, skin, absence, of, russeting, ease, of, shipping, lengthy, storage, ability, high, yields, disease, resistance, common, apple, shape, and, developed, flavor, modern, apples, are, generally, sweeter, than, older, cultivars, as, popular, tastes, in, apples, have, varied, over, time, most, north, americans, and, europeans, favor, sweet, subacid, apples, but, tart, apples, have, a, strong, minority, following, extremely, sweet, apples, with, barely, any, acid, flavor, are, popular, in, asia, especially, the, indian, subcontinent, old, cultivars, are, often, oddly, shaped, russeted, and, grow, in, a, variety, of, textures, and, colors, some, find, them, to, have, better, flavor, than, modern, cultivars, but, they, may, have, other, problems, that, make, them, commercially, unviable, low, yield, disease, susceptibility, poor, tolerance, for, storage, or, transport, or, just, being, the, wrong, size, a, few, old, cultivars, are, still, produced, on, a,

that, give, them, eternal, youthfulness, the, english, scholar, h, r, ellis, davidson, links, apples, to, religious, practices, in, germanic, paganism, from, which, norse, paganism, developed, she, points, out, that, buckets, of, apples, were, found, in, the, oseberg, ship, burial, site, in, norway, that, fruit, and, nuts, i, unn, having, been, described, as, being, transformed, into, a, nut, in, sk, ldskaparm, l, have, been, found, in, the, early, graves, of, the, germanic, peoples, in, england, and, elsewhere, on, the, continent, of, europe, which, may, have, had, a, symbolic, meaning, and, that, nuts, are, still, a, recognized, symbol, of, fertility, in, southwest, england, davidson, notes, a, connection, between, apples, and, the, vanir, a, tribe, of, gods, associated, with, fertility, in, norse, mythology, citing, an, instance, of, eleven, golden, apples, being, given, to, woo, the, beautiful, ger, r, by, sk, rnir, who, was, acting, as, messenger, for, the, major, vanir, god, freyr, in, stanzas, 19, and, 20, of, sk, rnism, l, davidson, also, notes, a, further, connection, between, fertility, and, apples, in, norse, mythology, in, chapter, 2, of, the, v, lsunga, saga, when, the, major, goddess, frigg, sends, king, rerir, an, apple, after, he, prays, to, odin, for, a, child, frigg, s, messenger, in, the, guise, of, a, crow, drops, the, apple, in, his, lap, as, he, sits, atop, a, mound, rerir, s, wife, s, consumption, of, the, apple, results, in, a, six, year, pregnancy, and, the, birth, by, caesarean, section, of, their, son, the, hero, v, lsung, further, davidson, points, out, the, strange, phrase, apples, of, hel, used, in, an, 11th, century, poem, by, the, skald, thorbiorn, br, narson, she, states, this, may, imply, that, the, apple, was, thought, of, by, br, narson, as, the, food, of, the, dead, further, davidson, notes, that, the, potentially, germanic, goddess, nehalennia, is, sometimes, depicted, with, apples, and, that, parallels, exist, in, early, irish, stories, davidson, asserts, that, while, cultivation, of, the, apple, in, northern, europe, extends, back, to, at, least, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, and, came, to, europe, from, the, near, east, the, native, varieties, of, apple, trees, growing, in, northern, europe, are, small, and, bitter, davidson, concludes, that, in, the, figure, of, i, unn, we, must, have, a, dim, reflection, of, an, old, symbol, that, of, the, guardian, goddess, of, the, life, giving, fruit, of, the, other, world, apples, appear, in, many, religious, traditions, often, as, a, mystical, or, forbidden, fruit, one, of, the, problems, identifying, apples, in, religion, mythology, and, folktales, is, that, the, word, apple, was, used, as, a, generic, term, for, all, foreign, fruit, other, than, berries, including, nuts, as, late, as, the, 17th, century, for, instance, in, greek, mythology, the, greek, hero, heracles, as, a, part, of, his, twelve, labours, was, required, to, travel, to, the, garden, of, the, hesperides, and, pick, the, golden, apples, off, the, tree, of, life, growing, at, its, center, the, greek, goddess, of, discord, eris, became, disgruntled, after, she, was, excluded, from, the, wedding, of, peleus, and, thetis, in, retaliation, she, tossed, a, golden, apple, inscribed, kallist, for, the, most, beautiful, one, into, the, wedding, party, three, goddesses, claimed, the, apple, hera, athena, and, aphrodite, paris, of, troy, was, appointed, to, select, the, recipient, after, being, bribed, by, both, hera, and, athena, aphrodite, tempted, him, with, the, most, beautiful, woman, in, the, world, helen, of, sparta, he, awarded, the, apple, to, aphrodite, thus, indirectly, causing, the, trojan, war, the, apple, was, thus, considered, in, ancient, greece, sacred, to, aphrodite, to, throw, an, apple, at, someone, was, to, symbolically, declare, one, s, love, and, similarly, to, catch, it, was, to, symbolically, show, one, s, acceptance, of, that, love, an, epigram, claiming, authorship, by, plato, states, i, throw, the, apple, at, you, and, if, you, are, willing, to, love, me, take, it, and, share, your, girlhood, with, me, but, if, your, thoughts, are, what, i, pray, they, are, not, even, then, take, it, and, consider, how, short, lived, is, beauty, atalanta, also, of, greek, mythology, raced, all, her, suitors, in, an, attempt, to, avoid, marriage, she, outran, all, but, hippomenes, also, known, as, melanion, a, name, possibly, derived, from, melon, the, greek, word, for, both, apple, and, fruit, in, general, who, defeated, her, by, cunning, not, speed, hippomenes, knew, that, he, could, not, win, in, a, fair, race, so, he, used, three, golden, apples, gifts, of, aphrodite, the, goddess, of, love, to, distract, atalanta, it, took, all, three, apples, and, all, of, his, speed, but, hippomenes, was, finally, successful, winning, the, race, and, atalanta, s, hand, in, celtic, mythology, the, otherworld, has, many, names, including, emain, ablach, emain, of, the, apple, trees, a, version, of, this, is, avalon, in, arthurian, legend, or, in, welsh, ynys, afallon, island, of, apples, in, china, apples, symbolise, peace, since, the, sounds, of, the, first, element, p, ng, in, the, words, apple, p, nggu, and, peace, p, ng, n, are, homophonous, in, mandarin, and, cantonese, when, these, two, words, are, combined, the, word, p, ng, ngu, peace, apples, is, formed, this, association, developed, further, as, the, name, for, christmas, eve, in, mandarin, is, p, ng, ny, peaceful, quiet, evening, which, made, the, gifting, of, apples, at, this, season, to, friends, and, associates, popular, as, a, way, to, wish, them, peace, and, safety, though, the, forbidden, fruit, of, eden, in, the, book, of, genesis, is, not, identified, popular, christian, tradition, has, held, that, it, was, an, apple, that, eve, coaxed, adam, to, share, with, her, the, origin, of, the, popular, identification, with, a, fruit, unknown, in, the, middle, east, in, biblical, times, is, found, in, wordplay, with, the, latin, words, m, lum, an, apple, and, m, lum, an, evil, each, of, which, is, normally, written, malum, the, tree, of, the, forbidden, fruit, is, called, the, tree, of, the, knowledge, of, good, and, evil, in, genesis, 2, 17, and, the, latin, for, good, and, evil, is, bonum, et, malum, renaissance, painters, may, also, have, been, influenced, by, the, story, of, the, golden, apples, in, the, garden, of, hesperides, as, a, result, in, the, story, of, adam, and, eve, the, apple, became, a, symbol, for, knowledge, immortality, temptation, the, fall, of, man, into, sin, and, sin, itself, the, larynx, in, the, human, throat, has, been, called, the, adam, s, apple, because, of, a, notion, that, it, was, caused, by, the, forbidden, fruit, remaining, in, the, throat, of, adam, the, apple, as, symbol, of, sexual, seduction, has, been, used, to, imply, human, sexuality, possibly, in, an, ironic, vein, the, proverb, an, apple, a, day, keeps, the, doctor, away, addressing, the, supposed, health, benefits, of, the, fruit, has, been, traced, to, 19th, century, wales, where, the, original, phrase, was, eat, an, apple, on, going, to, bed, and, you, ll, keep, the, doctor, from, earning, his, bread, in, the, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, the, phrase, evolved, to, an, apple, a, day, no, doctor, to, pay, and, an, apple, a, day, sends, the, doctor, away, the, phrasing, now, commonly, used, was, first, recorded, in, 1922
