apaloderma, euptilotis, harpactes, apalharpactes, pharomachrus, priotelus, trogon, the, trogons, and, quetzals, are, birds, in, the, order, trogoniformes, t, r, o, n, f, r, m, i, z, which, contains, only, one, family, the, trogonidae, the, family, trogonidae, contains, 46, species, in, seven, genera, the, fossil, record, of, the, trogons, dates, back, 49, million, years, to, the, early, eocene, they, might, constitute, a, member, of, the, basal, radiation, of, the, order, coraciiformes, and, order, passeriformes, or, be, closely, related, to, mousebirds, and, owls, the, word, trogon, is, greek, for, nibbling, and, refers, to, the, fact, that, these, birds, gnaw, holes, in, trees, to, make, their, nests, trogons, are, residents, of, tropical, forests, worldwide, the, greatest, diversity, is, in, the, neotropics, where, four, genera, containing, 24, species, occur, the, genus, apaloderma, contains, the, three, african, species, the, genera, harpactes, and, apalharpactes, containing, twelve, species, are, found, in, southeast, asia, they, feed, on, insects, and, fruit, and, their, broad, bills, and, weak, legs, reflect, their, diet, and, arboreal, habits, although, their, flight, is, fast, they, are, reluctant, to, fly, any, distance, trogons, are, generally, not, migratory, although, some, species, undertake, partial, local, movements, trogons, have, soft, often, colourful, feathers, with, distinctive, male, and, female, plumage, they, are, the, only, type, of, animal, with, a, heterodactyl, toe, arrangement, they, nest, in, holes, dug, into, trees, or, termite, nests, laying, 2, 4, white, or, pastel, coloured, eggs, the, position, of, the, trogons, within, the, class, aves, has, been, a, long, standing, mystery, a, variety, of, relations, have, been, suggested, including, the, parrots, cuckoos, toucans, jacamars, and, puffbirds, rollers, owls, and, nightjars, more, recent, morphological, and, molecular, evidence, has, suggested, a, relationship, with, the, coliiformes, the, unique, arrangement, of, the, toes, on, the, foot, see, morphology, and, flight, has, led, many, to, consider, the, trogons, to, have, no, close, relatives, to, place, them, in, their, own, order, possibly, with, the, similarly, atypical, mousebirds, as, their, closest, relatives, the, earliest, formally, described, fossil, specimen, is, a, cranium, from, the, fur, formation, lower, eocene, in, denmark, 54, mya, other, trogoniform, fossils, have, been, found, in, the, messel, pit, deposits, from, the, mid, eocene, in, germany, 49, mya, and, in, oligocene, and, miocene, deposits, from, switzerland, and, france, respectively, the, oldest, new, world, fossil, of, a, trogon, is, from, the, comparatively, recent, pleistocene, less, than, 2, 588, mya, the, family, had, been, thought, to, have, an, old, world, origin, notwithstanding, the, current, richness, of, the, family, which, is, more, diverse, in, the, neotropical, new, world, dna, evidence, seemed, to, support, an, african, origin, for, the, trogons, with, the, african, genus, apaloderma, seemingly, basal, in, the, family, and, the, other, two, lineages, the, asian, and, american, breaking, off, between, 20, 36, million, years, ago, more, recent, studies, show, that, the, dna, evidence, gives, contradictory, results, concerning, the, basal, phylogenetic, relationships, so, it, is, currently, unknown, if, all, extant, trogons, are, descended, from, an, african, or, an, american, ancestor, or, neither, the, trogons, are, split, into, three, subfamilies, each, reflecting, one, of, these, splits, aplodermatinae, is, the, african, subfamily, and, contains, a, single, genus, apaloderma, harpactinae, is, the, asian, subfamily, and, contains, two, genera, harpactes, and, apalharpactes, apalharpactes, consisting, of, two, species, in, java, and, sumatra, has, only, recently, been, accepted, as, a, separate, genus, from, harpactes, the, remaining, subfamily, the, neotropical, trogoninae, contains, the, remaining, four, genera, trogon, priotelus, pharomachrus, and, euptilotis, the, two, caribbean, species, of, priotelus, were, formerly, different, ones, temnotrogon, on, hispaniola, and, are, extremely, ancient, the, two, quetzal, genera, pharomachrus, and, euptilotis, are, possibly, derived, from, the, final, and, most, numerous, genus, of, trogons, in, the, neotropics, trogon, a, 2008, study, of, the, genetics, of, trogon, suggested, the, genus, originated, in, central, america, and, radiated, into, south, america, after, the, formation, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, thus, making, trogons, relatively, recent, arrivals, in, south, america, the, majority, of, trogons, are, birds, of, tropical, and, subtropical, forests, they, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, in, the, worlds, wet, tropics, being, found, in, the, americas, africa, and, asia, a, few, species, are, distributed, into, the, temperate, zone, with, one, species, the, elegant, trogon, reaching, the, south, of, the, united, states, specifically, southern, arizona, and, the, surrounding, area, the, narina, trogon, of, africa, is, slightly, exceptional, in, that, it, utilises, a, wider, range, of, habitats, than, any, other, trogon, ranging, from, dense, forest, to, fairly, open, savannah, and, from, the, equator, to, southern, south, africa, it, is, the, most, widespread, and, successful, of, all, the, trogons, the, eared, quetzal, of, mexico, is, also, able, to, use, more, xeric, habitats, but, preferentially, inhabits, forests, most, other, species, are, more, restricted, in, their, habitat, with, several, species, being, restricted, to, undisturbed, primary, forest, within, forests, they, tend, to, be, found, in, the, mid, story, occasionally, in, the, canopy, some, species, particularly, the, quetzals, are, adapted, to, cooler, montane, forest, there, are, a, number, of, insular, species, these, include, a, number, of, species, found, in, the, greater, sundas, one, species, in, the, philippines, as, well, as, two, species, endemic, to, cuba, and, hispaniola, respectively, outside, of, south, east, asia, and, the, caribbean, however, trogons, are, generally, absent, from, islands, especially, oceanic, ones, trogons, are, generally, sedentary, with, no, species, known, to, undertake, long, migrations, a, small, number, of, species, are, known, to, make, smaller, migratory, movements, particularly, montane, species, which, move, to, lower, altitudes, during, different, seasons, this, has, been, demonstrated, using, radio, tracking, in, the, resplendent, quetzal, in, costa, rica, and, evidence, has, been, accumulated, for, a, number, of, other, species, the, narina, trogon, of, africa, is, thought, to, undertake, some, localised, short, distance, migrations, over, parts, of, its, range, for, example, birds, of, zimbabwe, s, plateau, savannah, depart, after, the, breeding, season, a, complete, picture, of, these, movements, is, however, lacking, trogons, are, difficult, to, study, as, their, thick, tarsi, feet, bones, make, ringing, studies, difficult, the, trogons, as, a, family, are, fairly, uniform, in, appearance, having, compact, bodies, and, long, tails, very, long, in, the, case, of, the, quetzals, and, short, necks, trogons, range, in, size, from, the, 23, cm, 9, 1, in, 40, g, 1, 4, oz, scarlet, rumped, trogon, to, the, 40, cm, 16, in, 210, g, 7, 4, oz, resplendent, quetzal, not, including, the, male, quetzal, s, 3, foot, long, 0, 91, m, tail, streamers, their, legs, and, feet, are, weak, and, short, and, trogons, are, essentially, unable, to, walk, beyond, a, very, occasional, shuffle, along, a, branch, they, are, even, incapable, of, turning, around, on, a, branch, without, using, their, wings, the, ratio, of, leg, muscle, to, body, weight, in, trogons, is, only, 3, the, lowest, known, ratio, of, any, bird, the, arrangement, of, toes, on, the, feet, of, trogons, is, also, unique, among, birds, although, essentially, resembling, the, zygodactyl, s, two, forward, two, backward, arrangement, of, parrots, and, other, near, passerines, the, actual, toes, are, arranged, with, usually, inner, hallux, being, the, outer, hind, toe, an, arrangement, that, is, referred, to, as, heterodactylous, the, strong, bill, is, short, and, the, gape, wide, particularly, in, the, fruit, eating, quetzals, with, a, slight, hook, at, the, end, there, is, also, a, notch, at, the, end, of, the, bill, and, many, species, have, slight, serrations, in, the, mandibles, the, skin, is, exceptionally, tender, making, preparation, of, study, skins, difficult, for, museum, curators, the, skeletons, of, trogons, are, surprisingly, slender, particularly, the, skulls, which, are, very, thin, the, plumage, of, many, species, is, iridescent, although, not, in, most, of, the, asian, species, the, african, trogons, are, generally, green, on, the, back, with, red, bellies, the, new, world, trogons, similarly, have, green, or, deep, blue, upperparts, but, are, more, varied, in, their, lowerparts, the, asian, species, tend, towards, red, underparts, and, brown, backs, the, wings, are, short, but, strong, with, the, wing, muscle, ratio, being, around, 22, of, the, body, weight, in, spite, of, the, strength, of, their, flight, trogons, do, not, fly, often, or, for, great, distances, generally, flying, no, more, than, a, few, hundred, metres, at, a, time, only, the, montane, species, tend, to, make, long, distance, flights, shorter, flights, tend, to, be, direct, and, swift, but, longer, flights, are, slightly, undulating, their, flight, can, be, surprisingly, silent, for, observers, although, that, of, a, few, species, is, reportedly, quite, noisy, the, calls, of, trogons, are, generally, loud, and, uncomplex, consisting, of, monosyllabic, hoots, and, whistles, delivered, in, varying, patterns, and, sequences, the, calls, of, the, quetzals, and, the, two, caribbean, genera, are, the, most, complex, among, the, asian, genera, the, sumatran, trogon, apalharpactes, has, the, most, atypical, call, of, any, trogon, research, has, not, yet, established, whether, the, closely, related, javan, trogon, has, a, similar, call, the, calls, of, the, other, asian, genus, harpactes, are, remarkably, uniform, in, addition, to, the, territorial, and, breeding, calls, given, by, males, and, females, during, the, breeding, seasons, trogons, have, been, recorded, as, having, aggression, calls, given, by, competing, males, and, alarm, calls, trogons, are, generally, inactive, outside, of, infrequent, feeding, flights, among, birdwatchers, and, biologists, it, has, been, noted, that, part, from, their, great, beauty, are, notorious, for, their, lack, of, other, immediately, engaging, qualities, their, lack, of, activity, is, possibly, a, defence, against, predation, trogons, on, all, continents, have, been, reported, to, shift, about, on, branches, to, always, keep, their, less, brightly, coloured, backs, turned, towards, observers, while, their, heads, which, like, owls, can, turn, through, 180, degrees, keep, a, watch, on, the, watcher, trogons, have, reportedly, been, preyed, upon, by, hawks, and, predatory, mammals, one, report, was, of, a, resplendent, quetzal, taken, while, brooding, young, by, a, margay, trogons, feed, principally, on, insects, other, arthropods, and, fruit, to, a, lesser, extent, some, small, vertebrates, such, as, lizards, are, taken, among, the, insect, prey, taken, one, of, the, more, important, types, are, caterpillars, along, with, cuckoos, trogons, are, one, of, the, few, birds, groups, to, regularly, prey, upon, them, some, caterpillars, are, known, to, be, poisonous, to, trogons, though, like, arsenura, armida, the, extent, to, which, each, food, type, is, taken, varies, depending, on, geography, and, species, the, three, african, trogons, are, exclusively, insectivorous, whereas, the, asian, and, american, genera, consume, varying, amounts, of, fruit, diet, is, somewhat, correlated, with, size, with, larger, species, feeding, more, on, fruit, and, smaller, species, focusing, on, insects, prey, is, almost, always, obtained, on, the, wing, the, most, commonly, employed, foraging, technique, is, a, sally, glean, flight, where, a, trogon, flies, from, an, observation, perch, to, a, target, on, another, branch, or, in, foliage, once, there, the, birds, hovers, or, stalls, and, snatches, the, item, before, returning, to, its, perch, to, consume, the, item, this, type, of, foraging, is, commonly, used, by, some, types, of, bird, to, obtain, insect, prey, in, trogons, and, quetzals, it, is, also, used, to, pluck, fruit, from, trees, insect, prey, may, also, be, taken, on, the, wing, with, the, trogon, pursuing, flying, insects, in, a, similar, manner, to, drongos, and, old, world, flycatchers, frogs, lizards, and, large, insects, on, the, ground, may, also, be, pounced, on, from, the, air, more, rarely, some, trogons, may, shuffle, along, a, branch, to, obtain, insects, insect, eggs, and, very, occasionally, nestling, birds, violaceous, trogons, will, consume, wasps, and, wasp, larvae, encountered, while, digging, nests, trogons, are, territorial, and, monogamous, males, will, respond, quickly, to, playbacks, of, their, calls, and, will, repel, other, members, of, the, same, species, and, even, other, hole, nesting, species, from, around, their, nesting, sites, males, attract, females, by, singing, and, in, the, case, of, the, resplendent, quetzal, undertaking, display, flights, some, species, have, been, observed, in, small, flocks, of, 3, 12, individuals, prior, to, and, sometimes, during, the, breeding, season, calling, and, chasing, each, other, but, the, function, of, these, flocks, is, unclear, trogons, are, cavity, nesters, nests, are, dug, into, rotting, wood, or, termite, nests, with, one, species, the, violaceous, trogon, nesting, in, wasp, nests, nest, cavities, can, either, be, deep, upward, slanting, tubes, that, lead, to, fully, enclosed, chambers, or, much, shallower, open, niches, from, which, the, bird, is, visible, nests, are, dug, with, the, beak, incidentally, giving, the, family, its, name, nest, digging, may, be, undertaken, by, the, male, alone, or, by, both, sexes, in, the, case, of, nests, dug, into, tree, trunks, the, wood, must, be, strong, enough, not, to, collapse, but, soft, enough, to, dig, out, trogons, have, been, observed, landing, on, dead, tree, trunks, and, slapping, the, wood, with, their, tails, presumably, to, test, the, firmness, the, nests, of, trogons, are, thought, to, usually, be, unlined, between, two, and, four, eggs, are, laid, in, a, nesting, attempt, these, are, round, and, generally, glossy, white, or, lightly, coloured, buff, grey, blue, or, green, although, they, get, increasingly, dirty, during, incubation, both, parents, incubate, the, eggs, except, in, the, case, of, the, bare, cheeked, trogon, where, apparently, the, male, takes, no, part, with, the, male, taking, one, long, incubation, stint, a, day, and, the, female, incubating, the, rest, of, the, time, incubation, seems, to, begin, after, the, last, egg, is, laid, the, incubation, period, varies, by, species, usually, lasting, between, 16, 19, days, on, hatching, the, chicks, are, altricial, blind, and, naked, the, chicks, acquire, feathers, rapidly, in, some, of, the, montane, species, in, the, case, of, the, mountain, trogon, in, a, week, but, more, slowly, in, lowland, species, like, the, black, headed, trogon, which, may, take, twice, as, long, the, nestling, period, varies, by, species, and, size, with, smaller, species, generally, taking, 16, to, 17, days, to, fledge, whereas, larger, species, may, take, as, long, as, 30, days, although, 23, 25, days, is, more, typical, trogons, and, quetzals, are, considered, to, be, among, the, most, beautiful, of, birds, yet, they, are, also, often, reclusive, and, seldom, seen, little, is, known, about, much, of, their, biology, and, much, of, what, is, known, about, them, comes, from, the, research, of, neotropical, species, by, the, ornithologist, alexander, skutch, trogons, are, nevertheless, popular, birds, with, birdwatchers, and, there, is, a, modest, ecotourism, industry, in, particular, to, view, quetzals, in, central, america, harpactes, apaloderma, trogon, priotelus, euptilotis, pharomachrus
