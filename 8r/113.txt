the, female, reproductive, system, is, made, up, of, the, internal, and, external, sex, organs, that, function, in, the, reproduction, of, new, offspring, the, human, female, reproductive, system, is, immature, at, birth, and, develops, to, maturity, at, puberty, to, be, able, to, produce, gametes, and, to, carry, a, fetus, to, full, term, the, internal, sex, organs, are, the, vagina, uterus, fallopian, tubes, and, ovaries, the, female, reproductive, tract, includes, the, vagina, uterus, and, fallopian, tubes, and, is, prone, to, infections, the, vagina, allows, for, sexual, intercourse, and, childbirth, and, is, connected, to, the, uterus, at, the, cervix, the, uterus, or, womb, accommodates, the, embryo, which, develops, into, the, fetus, the, uterus, also, produces, secretions, which, help, the, transit, of, sperm, to, the, fallopian, tubes, where, sperm, fertilize, ova, egg, cells, produced, by, the, ovaries, the, external, sex, organs, are, also, known, as, the, genitals, and, these, are, the, organs, of, the, vulva, including, the, labia, clitoris, and, vestibule, during, the, menstrual, cycle, the, ovaries, release, an, ovum, which, transits, through, the, fallopian, tube, into, the, uterus, if, an, egg, cell, meets, with, sperm, on, its, way, to, the, uterus, a, single, sperm, cell, can, enter, and, merge, with, it, fertilizing, it, into, a, zygote, fertilization, usually, occurs, in, the, fallopian, tubes, and, marks, the, beginning, of, embryogenesis, the, zygote, will, then, divide, over, enough, generations, of, cells, to, form, a, blastocyst, which, implants, itself, in, the, wall, of, the, uterus, this, begins, the, period, of, gestation, and, the, embryo, will, continue, to, develop, until, full, term, when, the, fetus, has, developed, enough, to, survive, outside, the, uterus, the, cervix, dilates, and, contractions, of, the, uterus, propel, the, newborn, through, the, birth, canal, the, vagina, the, corresponding, equivalent, among, males, is, the, male, reproductive, system, the, vulva, is, of, all, of, the, external, parts, and, tissues, and, includes, the, following, the, vagina, is, a, fibromuscular, made, up, of, fibrous, and, muscular, tissue, canal, leading, from, the, outside, of, the, body, to, the, cervix, of, the, uterus, it, is, also, referred, to, as, the, birth, canal, in, the, context, of, pregnancy, the, vagina, accommodates, a, penis, during, sexual, intercourse, semen, containing, spermatozoa, is, ejaculated, from, the, penis, at, orgasm, into, the, vagina, potentially, enabling, fertilization, of, the, egg, cell, ovum, to, take, place, the, cervix, is, the, neck, of, the, uterus, the, lower, narrow, portion, where, it, joins, with, the, upper, part, of, the, vagina, it, is, cylindrical, or, conical, in, shape, and, protrudes, through, the, upper, anterior, vaginal, wall, approximately, half, its, length, is, visible, the, remainder, lies, above, the, vagina, beyond, view, the, vagina, has, a, thick, layer, outside, and, it, is, the, opening, where, the, fetus, emerges, during, delivery, the, uterus, or, womb, is, the, major, female, reproductive, organ, the, uterus, provides, mechanical, protection, nutritional, support, and, waste, removal, for, the, developing, embryo, weeks, 1, to, 8, and, fetus, from, week, 9, until, the, delivery, in, addition, contractions, in, the, muscular, wall, of, the, uterus, are, important, in, pushing, out, the, fetus, at, the, time, of, birth, the, uterus, contains, three, suspensory, ligaments, that, help, stabilize, the, position, of, the, uterus, and, limits, its, range, of, movement, the, uterosacral, ligaments, keep, the, body, from, moving, inferiorly, and, anteriorly, the, round, ligaments, restrict, posterior, movement, of, the, uterus, the, cardinal, ligaments, also, prevent, the, inferior, movement, of, the, uterus, the, uterus, is, a, pear, shaped, muscular, organ, its, major, function, is, to, accept, a, fertilized, ovum, which, becomes, implanted, into, the, endometrium, and, derives, nourishment, from, blood, vessels, which, develop, exclusively, for, this, purpose, the, fertilized, ovum, becomes, an, embryo, develops, into, a, fetus, and, gestates, until, childbirth, if, the, egg, does, not, embed, in, the, wall, of, the, uterus, the, female, begins, menstruation, the, fallopian, tubes, are, two, tubes, leading, from, the, ovaries, into, the, uterus, on, maturity, of, an, ovum, the, follicle, and, the, ovary, s, wall, rupture, allowing, the, ovum, to, escape, and, enter, the, fallopian, tube, there, it, travels, toward, the, uterus, pushed, along, by, movements, of, cilia, on, the, inner, lining, of, the, tubes, this, trip, takes, hours, or, days, if, the, ovum, is, fertilized, while, in, the, fallopian, tube, then, it, normally, implants, in, the, endometrium, when, it, reaches, the, uterus, which, signals, the, beginning, of, pregnancy, the, ovaries, are, small, paired, gonads, located, near, the, lateral, walls, of, the, pelvic, cavity, these, organs, are, responsible, for, the, production, of, the, egg, cells, ova, and, the, secretion, of, hormones, the, process, by, which, the, egg, cell, ovum, is, released, is, called, ovulation, the, speed, of, ovulation, is, periodic, and, impacts, directly, to, the, length, of, a, menstrual, cycle, after, ovulation, the, egg, cell, travels, through, the, fallopian, tube, toward, the, uterus, if, fertilization, is, going, to, occur, it, often, happens, in, the, fallopian, tube, the, fertilized, egg, can, then, proceed, to, try, and, implant, on, the, uterus, s, lining, during, fertilization, the, egg, cell, plays, a, role, it, releases, certain, molecules, that, are, essential, to, guiding, the, sperm, and, allows, the, surface, of, the, egg, to, attach, to, the, sperm, s, surface, the, egg, can, then, absorb, the, sperm, and, fertilization, can, then, begin, the, vestibular, glands, also, known, as, the, female, accessory, glands, are, the, bartholin, s, glands, which, produce, a, mucous, fluid, for, vaginal, lubrication, and, the, skene, s, glands, for, the, ejaculation, of, fluid, as, well, as, for, lubricating, the, meatus, the, female, reproductive, system, functions, to, produce, offspring, in, the, absence, of, fertilization, the, ovum, will, eventually, traverse, the, entire, reproductive, tract, from, the, fallopian, tube, until, exiting, the, vagina, through, menstruation, the, reproductive, tract, can, be, used, for, various, transluminal, procedures, such, as, fertiloscopy, intrauterine, insemination, and, transluminal, sterilization, chromosome, characteristics, determine, the, genetic, sex, of, a, fetus, at, conception, this, is, specifically, based, on, the, 23rd, pair, of, chromosomes, that, is, inherited, since, the, mother, s, egg, contains, an, x, chromosome, and, the, father, s, sperm, contains, either, an, x, or, y, chromosome, it, is, the, male, who, determines, the, fetus, sex, if, the, fetus, inherits, the, x, chromosome, from, the, father, the, fetus, will, be, a, female, in, this, case, testosterone, is, not, made, and, the, wolffian, duct, will, degrade, thus, the, m, llerian, duct, will, develop, into, female, sex, organs, the, clitoris, is, the, remnants, of, the, wolffian, duct, on, the, other, hand, if, the, fetus, inherits, the, y, chromosome, from, the, father, the, fetus, will, be, a, male, the, presence, of, testosterone, will, stimulate, the, wolffian, duct, which, will, bring, about, the, development, of, the, male, sex, organs, and, the, m, llerian, duct, will, degrade, vaginitis, is, inflammation, of, the, vagina, and, largely, caused, by, an, infection, it, is, the, most, common, gynaecological, condition, presented, it, is, difficult, to, determine, any, one, organism, most, responsible, for, vaginitis, because, it, varies, from, range, of, age, sexual, activity, and, method, of, microbial, identification, vaginitis, is, not, necessarily, caused, by, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, as, there, are, many, infectious, agents, that, make, use, of, the, close, proximity, to, mucous, membranes, and, secretions, vaginitis, is, usually, diagnosed, based, on, the, presence, of, vaginal, discharge, which, can, have, a, certain, color, odor, or, quality, this, is, a, vaginal, infection, in, women, it, differs, from, vaginitis, in, that, there, is, no, inflammation, bacterial, vaginosis, is, polymicrobial, consisting, of, many, bacteria, species, the, diagnosis, for, bacterial, vaginosis, is, made, if, three, of, the, following, four, criteria, are, present, 1, homogenous, thin, discharge, 2, a, ph, of, 4, 5, in, the, vagina, 3, epithelial, cells, in, the, vagina, with, bacteria, attached, to, them, or, 4, a, fishy, odor, it, has, been, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, other, genital, tract, infections, such, as, endometritis, this, is, a, common, cause, of, vaginal, irritation, and, according, to, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, at, least, 75, of, adult, women, have, experienced, one, at, least, once, in, their, lifetime, yeast, infections, are, caused, by, an, overgrowth, of, fungus, in, the, vagina, known, as, candida, yeast, infections, are, usually, caused, by, an, imbalance, of, the, ph, in, the, vagina, which, is, usually, acidic, other, factors, such, as, pregnancy, diabetes, weakened, immune, systems, tight, fitting, clothing, or, douching, can, also, be, a, cause, symptoms, of, yeast, infections, include, itching, burning, irritation, and, a, white, cottage, cheese, like, discharge, from, the, vagina, women, have, also, reported, that, they, experience, painful, intercourse, and, urination, as, well, taking, a, sample, of, the, vaginal, secretions, and, placing, them, under, a, microscope, for, evidence, of, yeast, can, diagnose, a, yeast, infection, treatment, varies, from, creams, that, can, be, applied, in, or, around, the, vaginal, area, to, oral, tablets, that, stop, the, growth, of, fungus, there, are, many, practices, of, mutilating, female, genitalia, in, different, cultures, the, most, common, two, types, of, genital, mutilation, practiced, are, clitoridectomy, the, circumcision, of, the, clitoris, and, the, excision, of, the, clitoral, prepuce, they, can, all, involve, a, range, of, adverse, health, consequences, such, as, bleeding, irreparable, tissue, damage, and, sepsis, which, can, sometimes, prove, fatal, genitoplasty, refers, to, surgery, that, is, carried, out, to, repair, damaged, sex, organs, particularly, following, cancer, and, its, treatment, there, are, also, elective, surgical, procedures, which, change, the, appearance, of, the, external, genitals, there, are, many, types, of, birth, control, available, to, females, birth, control, can, be, hormonal, or, physical, in, nature, oral, contraception, can, assist, with, management, of, various, medical, conditions, such, as, menorrhagia, however, oral, contraceptives, can, have, a, variety, of, side, effects, including, depression, the, international, federation, of, gynaecology, and, obstetrics, was, founded, in, 1954, to, promote, the, well, being, of, women, particularly, in, raising, the, standards, of, gynaecological, practice, and, care, as, of, 2010, there, were, 124, countries, involved, reproductive, rights, are, legal, rights, related, to, reproduction, and, reproductive, health, women, have, the, right, to, control, matters, involving, their, sexuality, including, their, sexual, and, reproductive, health, violation, of, these, rights, include, forced, pregnancy, forced, sterilization, forced, abortion, and, genital, mutilation, female, genital, mutilation, is, the, complete, or, partial, removal, of, a, female, s, external, genitals, it, is, claimed, in, the, hippocratic, writings, that, both, males, and, females, contribute, their, seed, to, conception, otherwise, children, would, not, resemble, either, or, both, of, their, parents, four, hundred, years, later, galen, identified, the, source, of, female, semen, as, the, ovaries, in, female, reproductive, organs
