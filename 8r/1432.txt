smallpox, was, an, infectious, disease, caused, by, variola, virus, often, called, smallpox, virus, which, belongs, to, the, genus, orthopoxvirus, the, last, naturally, occurring, case, was, diagnosed, in, october, 1977, and, the, world, health, organization, who, certified, the, global, eradication, of, the, disease, in, 1980, making, smallpox, the, only, human, disease, to, have, been, eradicated, to, date, the, initial, symptoms, of, the, disease, included, fever, and, vomiting, this, was, followed, by, formation, of, ulcers, in, the, mouth, and, a, skin, rash, over, a, number, of, days, the, skin, rash, turned, into, the, characteristic, fluid, filled, blisters, with, a, dent, in, the, center, the, bumps, then, scabbed, over, and, fell, off, leaving, scars, the, disease, was, transmitted, from, one, person, to, another, primarily, through, prolonged, face, to, face, contact, with, an, infected, person, or, rarely, via, contaminated, objects, prevention, was, achieved, mainly, through, the, smallpox, vaccine, once, the, disease, had, developed, certain, antiviral, medications, could, potentially, have, helped, but, such, medications, did, not, become, available, until, after, the, disease, was, eradicated, the, risk, of, death, was, about, 30, with, higher, rates, among, babies, often, those, who, survived, had, extensive, scarring, of, their, skin, and, some, were, left, blind, the, earliest, evidence, of, the, disease, dates, to, around, 1500, bc, in, egyptian, mummies, the, disease, historically, occurred, in, outbreaks, it, was, one, of, several, diseases, introduced, by, the, columbian, exchange, to, the, new, world, resulting, in, large, swathes, of, native, americans, dying, in, 18th, century, europe, it, is, estimated, that, 400, 000, people, died, from, the, disease, per, year, and, that, one, third, of, all, cases, of, blindness, were, due, to, smallpox, smallpox, is, estimated, to, have, killed, up, to, 300, million, people, in, the, 20th, century, and, around, 500, million, people, in, the, last, 100, years, of, its, existence, earlier, deaths, included, six, european, monarchs, including, louis, xv, of, france, in, 1774, as, recently, as, 1967, 15, million, cases, occurred, a, year, the, final, known, fatal, case, occurred, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1978, inoculation, for, smallpox, appears, to, have, started, in, china, around, the, 1500s, europe, adopted, this, practice, from, asia, in, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, in, 1796, edward, jenner, introduced, the, modern, smallpox, vaccine, in, 1967, the, who, intensified, efforts, to, eliminate, the, disease, smallpox, is, one, of, two, infectious, diseases, to, have, been, eradicated, the, other, being, rinderpest, a, disease, of, even, toed, ungulates, in, 2011, the, term, smallpox, was, first, used, in, england, in, the, 16th, century, to, distinguish, the, disease, from, syphilis, which, was, then, known, as, the, great, pox, other, historical, names, for, the, disease, include, pox, speckled, monster, and, red, plague, the, united, states, and, russia, retain, samples, of, variola, virus, in, laboratories, which, has, sparked, debates, over, safety, there, are, two, forms, of, the, smallpox, variola, major, is, the, severe, and, most, common, form, with, a, more, extensive, rash, and, higher, fever, variola, minor, is, a, less, common, presentation, causing, less, severe, disease, typically, discrete, smallpox, with, historical, death, rates, of, 1, or, less, subclinical, asymptomatic, infections, with, variola, virus, were, noted, but, were, not, common, in, addition, a, form, called, variola, sine, eruptione, smallpox, without, rash, was, seen, generally, in, vaccinated, persons, this, form, was, marked, by, a, fever, that, occurred, after, the, usual, incubation, period, and, could, be, confirmed, only, by, antibody, studies, or, rarely, by, viral, culture, in, addition, there, were, two, very, rare, and, fulminating, types, of, smallpox, the, malignant, flat, and, hemorrhagic, forms, which, were, usually, fatal, the, initial, symptoms, were, similar, to, other, viral, diseases, that, are, still, extant, such, as, influenza, and, the, common, cold, fever, of, at, least, 38, 3, c, 101, f, muscle, pain, malaise, headache, and, fatigue, as, the, digestive, tract, was, commonly, involved, nausea, vomiting, and, backache, often, occurred, the, early, prodromal, stage, usually, lasted, 2, 4, days, by, days, 12, 15, the, first, visible, lesions, small, reddish, spots, called, enanthem, appeared, on, mucous, membranes, of, the, mouth, tongue, palate, and, throat, and, the, temperature, fell, to, near, normal, these, lesions, rapidly, enlarged, and, ruptured, releasing, large, amounts, of, virus, into, the, saliva, variola, virus, tended, to, attack, skin, cells, causing, the, characteristic, pimples, or, macules, associated, with, the, disease, a, rash, developed, on, the, skin, 24, to, 48, hours, after, lesions, on, the, mucous, membranes, appeared, typically, the, macules, first, appeared, on, the, forehead, then, rapidly, spread, to, the, whole, face, proximal, portions, of, extremities, the, trunk, and, lastly, to, distal, portions, of, extremities, the, process, took, no, more, than, 24, to, 36, hours, after, which, no, new, lesions, appeared, at, this, point, variola, major, disease, could, take, several, very, different, courses, which, resulted, in, four, types, of, smallpox, disease, based, on, the, rao, classification, ordinary, modified, malignant, or, flat, and, hemorrhagic, smallpox, historically, ordinary, smallpox, had, an, overall, fatality, rate, of, about, 30, and, the, malignant, and, hemorrhagic, forms, were, usually, fatal, the, modified, form, was, almost, never, fatal, in, early, hemorrhagic, cases, hemorrhages, occurred, before, any, skin, lesions, developed, the, incubation, period, between, contraction, and, the, first, obvious, symptoms, of, the, disease, was, 7, 14, days, at, least, 90, of, smallpox, cases, among, unvaccinated, persons, were, of, the, ordinary, type, in, this, form, of, the, disease, by, the, second, day, of, the, rash, the, macules, had, become, raised, papules, by, the, third, or, fourth, day, the, papules, had, filled, with, an, opalescent, fluid, to, become, vesicles, this, fluid, became, opaque, and, turbid, within, 24, 48, hours, resulting, in, pustules, by, the, sixth, or, seventh, day, all, the, skin, lesions, had, become, pustules, between, seven, and, ten, days, the, pustules, had, matured, and, reached, their, maximum, size, the, pustules, were, sharply, raised, typically, round, tense, and, firm, to, the, touch, the, pustules, were, deeply, embedded, in, the, dermis, giving, them, the, feel, of, a, small, bead, in, the, skin, fluid, slowly, leaked, from, the, pustules, and, by, the, end, of, the, second, week, the, pustules, had, deflated, and, began, to, dry, up, forming, crusts, or, scabs, by, day, 16, 20, scabs, had, formed, over, all, of, the, lesions, which, had, started, to, flake, off, leaving, depigmented, scars, ordinary, smallpox, generally, produced, a, discrete, rash, in, which, the, pustules, stood, out, on, the, skin, separately, the, distribution, of, the, rash, was, most, dense, on, the, face, denser, on, the, extremities, than, on, the, trunk, and, denser, on, the, distal, parts, of, the, extremities, than, on, the, proximal, the, palms, of, the, hands, and, soles, of, the, feet, were, involved, in, most, cases, sometimes, the, blisters, merged, into, sheets, forming, a, confluent, rash, which, began, to, detach, the, outer, layers, of, skin, from, the, underlying, flesh, patients, with, confluent, smallpox, often, remained, ill, even, after, scabs, had, formed, over, all, the, lesions, in, one, case, series, the, case, fatality, rate, in, confluent, smallpox, was, 62, referring, to, the, character, of, the, eruption, and, the, rapidity, of, its, development, modified, smallpox, occurred, mostly, in, previously, vaccinated, people, it, was, rare, in, unvaccinated, people, with, one, case, study, showing, 1, 2, of, modified, cases, compared, to, around, 25, in, vaccinated, people, in, this, form, the, prodromal, illness, still, occurred, but, may, have, been, less, severe, than, in, the, ordinary, type, there, was, usually, no, fever, during, the, evolution, of, the, rash, the, skin, lesions, tended, to, be, fewer, and, evolved, more, quickly, were, more, superficial, and, may, not, have, shown, the, uniform, characteristic, of, more, typical, smallpox, modified, smallpox, was, rarely, if, ever, fatal, this, form, of, variola, major, was, more, easily, confused, with, chickenpox, in, malignant, type, smallpox, also, called, flat, smallpox, the, lesions, remained, almost, flush, with, the, skin, at, the, time, when, raised, vesicles, would, have, formed, in, the, ordinary, type, it, is, unknown, why, some, people, developed, this, type, historically, it, accounted, for, 5, 10, of, cases, and, most, 72, were, children, malignant, smallpox, was, accompanied, by, a, severe, prodromal, phase, that, lasted, 3, 4, days, prolonged, high, fever, and, severe, symptoms, of, viremia, the, prodromal, symptoms, continued, even, after, the, onset, of, the, rash, the, rash, on, the, mucous, membranes, enanthem, was, extensive, skin, lesions, matured, slowly, were, typically, confluent, or, semi, confluent, and, by, the, seventh, or, eighth, day, they, were, flat, and, appeared, to, be, buried, in, the, skin, unlike, ordinary, type, smallpox, the, vesicles, contained, little, fluid, were, soft, and, velvety, to, the, touch, and, may, have, contained, hemorrhages, malignant, smallpox, was, nearly, always, fatal, and, death, usually, occurred, between, the, 8th, and, 12th, day, of, illness, often, a, day, or, two, before, death, the, lesions, turned, ashen, gray, which, along, with, abdominal, distension, was, a, bad, prognostic, sign, this, form, is, thought, to, be, caused, by, deficient, cell, mediated, immunity, to, smallpox, if, the, person, recovered, the, lesions, gradually, faded, and, did, not, form, scars, or, scabs, hemorrhagic, smallpox, is, a, severe, form, accompanied, by, extensive, bleeding, into, the, skin, mucous, membranes, gastrointestinal, tract, and, viscera, this, form, develops, in, approximately, 2, of, infections, and, occurs, mostly, in, adults, pustules, do, not, typically, form, in, hemorrhagic, smallpox, instead, bleeding, occurs, under, the, skin, making, it, look, charred, and, black, hence, this, form, of, the, disease, is, also, referred, to, as, variola, nigra, or, black, pox, hemorrhagic, smallpox, has, very, rarely, been, caused, by, variola, minor, virus, while, bleeding, may, occur, in, mild, cases, and, not, affect, outcomes, hemorrhagic, smallpox, is, typically, fatal, vaccination, does, not, appear, to, provide, any, immunity, to, either, form, of, hemorrhagic, smallpox, and, some, cases, even, occurred, among, people, that, were, revaccinated, shortly, before, it, has, two, forms, the, early, or, fulminant, form, of, hemorrhagic, smallpox, referred, to, as, purpura, variolosa, begins, with, a, prodromal, phase, characterized, by, a, high, fever, severe, headache, and, abdominal, pain, the, skin, becomes, dusky, and, erythematous, and, this, is, rapidly, followed, by, the, development, of, petechiae, and, bleeding, in, the, skin, conjunctiva, and, mucous, membranes, death, often, occurs, suddenly, between, the, fifth, and, seventh, days, of, illness, when, only, a, few, insignificant, skin, lesions, are, present, some, people, survive, a, few, days, longer, during, which, time, the, skin, detaches, and, fluid, accumulates, under, it, rupturing, at, the, slightest, injury, people, are, usually, conscious, until, death, or, shortly, before, autopsy, reveals, petechiae, and, bleeding, in, the, spleen, kidney, serous, membranes, skeletal, muscles, pericardium, liver, gonads, and, bladder, historically, this, condition, was, frequently, misdiagnosed, with, the, correct, diagnosis, made, only, at, autopsy, this, form, is, more, likely, to, occur, in, pregnant, women, than, in, the, general, population, approximately, 16, of, cases, in, unvaccinated, pregnant, women, were, early, hemorrhagic, smallpox, versus, roughly, 1, in, nonpregnant, women, and, adult, males, the, case, fatality, rate, of, early, hemorrhagic, smallpox, approaches, 100, there, is, also, a, later, form, of, hemorrhagic, smallpox, referred, to, late, hemorrhagic, smallpox, or, variolosa, pustula, hemorrhagica, the, prodrome, is, severe, and, similar, to, that, observed, in, early, hemorrhagic, smallpox, and, the, fever, persists, throughout, the, course, of, the, disease, bleeding, appears, in, the, early, eruptive, period, but, later, than, that, seen, in, purpura, variolosa, and, the, rash, is, often, flat, and, does, not, progress, beyond, the, vesicular, stage, hemorrhages, in, the, mucous, membranes, appear, to, occur, less, often, than, in, the, early, hemorrhagic, form, sometimes, the, rash, forms, pustules, which, bleed, at, the, base, and, then, undergo, the, same, process, as, in, ordinary, smallpox, this, form, of, the, disease, is, characterized, by, a, decrease, in, all, of, the, elements, of, the, coagulation, cascade, and, an, increase, in, circulating, antithrombin, this, form, of, smallpox, occurs, anywhere, from, 3, to, 25, of, fatal, cases, depending, on, the, virulence, of, the, smallpox, strain, most, people, with, the, late, stage, form, die, within, eight, to, 10, days, of, illness, among, the, few, who, recover, the, hemorrhagic, lesions, gradually, disappear, after, a, long, period, of, convalescence, the, case, fatality, rate, for, late, hemorrhagic, smallpox, is, around, 90, 95, pregnant, women, are, slightly, more, likely, to, experience, this, form, of, the, disease, though, not, as, much, as, early, hemorrhagic, smallpox, smallpox, is, caused, by, infection, with, variola, virus, which, belongs, to, the, family, poxviridae, subfamily, chordopoxvirinae, genus, orthopoxvirus, the, date, of, the, appearance, of, smallpox, is, not, settled, it, most, probably, evolved, from, a, terrestrial, african, rodent, virus, between, 68, 000, and, 16, 000, years, ago, the, wide, range, of, dates, is, due, to, the, different, records, used, to, calibrate, the, molecular, clock, one, clade, was, the, variola, major, strains, the, more, clinically, severe, form, of, smallpox, which, spread, from, asia, between, 400, and, 1, 600, years, ago, a, second, clade, included, both, alastrim, a, phenotypically, mild, smallpox, described, from, the, american, continents, and, isolates, from, west, africa, which, diverged, from, an, ancestral, strain, between, 1, 400, and, 6, 300, years, before, present, this, clade, further, diverged, into, two, subclades, at, least, 800, years, ago, a, second, estimate, has, placed, the, separation, of, variola, virus, from, taterapox, an, orthopoxvirus, of, some, african, rodents, including, gerbils, at, 3, 000, to, 4, 000, years, ago, this, is, consistent, with, archaeological, and, historical, evidence, regarding, the, appearance, of, smallpox, as, a, human, disease, which, suggests, a, relatively, recent, origin, if, the, mutation, rate, is, assumed, to, be, similar, to, that, of, the, herpesviruses, the, divergence, date, of, variola, virus, from, taterapox, has, been, estimated, to, be, 50, 000, years, ago, while, this, is, consistent, with, the, other, published, estimates, it, suggests, that, the, archaeological, and, historical, evidence, is, very, incomplete, better, estimates, of, mutation, rates, in, these, viruses, are, needed, examination, of, a, strain, that, dates, from, c, 1650, found, that, this, strain, was, basal, to, the, other, presently, sequenced, strains, the, mutation, rate, of, this, virus, is, well, modeled, by, a, molecular, clock, diversification, of, strains, only, occurred, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, variola, virus, is, large, and, brick, shaped, and, is, approximately, 302, to, 350, nanometers, by, 244, to, 270, nm, with, a, single, linear, double, stranded, dna, genome, 186, kilobase, pairs, kbp, in, size, and, containing, a, hairpin, loop, at, each, end, four, orthopoxviruses, cause, infection, in, humans, variola, vaccinia, cowpox, and, monkeypox, variola, virus, infects, only, humans, in, nature, although, primates, and, other, animals, have, been, infected, in, an, experimental, setting, vaccinia, cowpox, and, monkeypox, viruses, can, infect, both, humans, and, other, animals, in, nature, the, life, cycle, of, poxviruses, is, complicated, by, having, multiple, infectious, forms, with, differing, mechanisms, of, cell, entry, poxviruses, are, unique, among, human, dna, viruses, in, that, they, replicate, in, the, cytoplasm, of, the, cell, rather, than, in, the, nucleus, to, replicate, poxviruses, produce, a, variety, of, specialized, proteins, not, produced, by, other, dna, viruses, the, most, important, of, which, is, a, viral, associated, dna, dependent, rna, polymerase, both, enveloped, and, unenveloped, virions, are, infectious, the, viral, envelope, is, made, of, modified, golgi, membranes, containing, viral, specific, polypeptides, including, hemagglutinin, infection, with, either, variola, major, virus, or, variola, minor, virus, confers, immunity, against, the, other, the, more, common, infectious, form, of, the, disease, was, caused, by, the, variola, major, virus, strain, known, for, its, significantly, higher, mortality, rate, compared, to, its, counterpart, variola, minor, variola, major, had, a, fatality, rate, of, around, 30, while, variola, minor, s, mortality, rate, was, about, 1, throughout, the, 18th, century, variola, major, was, responsible, for, around, 400, 000, deaths, annually, in, europe, alone, survivors, of, the, disease, often, faced, lifelong, consequences, such, as, blindness, and, severe, scarring, which, were, nearly, universal, among, those, who, recovered, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, variola, major, was, the, primary, cause, of, smallpox, outbreaks, across, asia, and, most, of, africa, meanwhile, variola, minor, was, more, commonly, found, in, regions, of, europe, north, america, south, america, and, certain, parts, of, africa, variola, minor, virus, also, called, alastrim, was, a, less, common, form, of, the, virus, and, much, less, deadly, although, variola, minor, had, the, same, incubation, period, and, pathogenetic, stages, as, smallpox, it, is, believed, to, have, had, a, mortality, rate, of, less, than, 1, as, compared, to, variola, major, s, 30, like, variola, major, variola, minor, was, spread, through, inhalation, of, the, virus, in, the, air, which, could, occur, through, face, to, face, contact, or, through, fomites, infection, with, variola, minor, virus, conferred, immunity, against, the, more, dangerous, variola, major, virus, because, variola, minor, was, a, less, debilitating, disease, than, smallpox, people, were, more, frequently, ambulant, and, thus, able, to, infect, others, more, rapidly, as, such, variola, minor, swept, through, the, united, states, great, britain, and, south, africa, in, the, early, 20th, century, becoming, the, dominant, form, of, the, disease, in, those, areas, and, thus, rapidly, decreasing, mortality, rates, along, with, variola, major, the, minor, form, has, now, been, totally, eradicated, from, the, globe, the, last, case, of, indigenous, variola, minor, was, reported, in, a, somali, cook, ali, maow, maalin, in, october, 1977, and, smallpox, was, officially, declared, eradicated, worldwide, in, may, 1980, variola, minor, was, also, called, white, pox, kaffir, pox, cuban, itch, west, indian, pox, milk, pox, and, pseudovariola, the, genome, of, variola, major, virus, is, about, 186, 000, base, pairs, in, length, it, is, made, from, linear, double, stranded, dna, and, contains, the, coding, sequence, for, about, 200, genes, the, genes, are, usually, not, overlapping, and, typically, occur, in, blocks, that, point, towards, the, closer, terminal, region, of, the, genome, the, coding, sequence, of, the, central, region, of, the, genome, is, highly, consistent, across, orthopoxviruses, and, the, arrangement, of, genes, is, consistent, across, chordopoxviruses, the, center, of, the, variola, virus, genome, contains, the, majority, of, the, essential, viral, genes, including, the, genes, for, structural, proteins, dna, replication, transcription, and, mrna, synthesis, the, ends, of, the, genome, vary, more, across, strains, and, species, of, orthopoxviruses, these, regions, contain, proteins, that, modulate, the, hosts, immune, systems, and, are, primarily, responsible, for, the, variability, in, virulence, across, the, orthopoxvirus, family, these, terminal, regions, in, poxviruses, are, inverted, terminal, repetitions, itr, sequences, these, sequences, are, identical, but, oppositely, oriented, on, either, end, of, the, genome, leading, to, the, genome, being, a, continuous, loop, of, dna, components, of, the, itr, sequences, include, an, incompletely, base, paired, a, t, rich, hairpin, loop, a, region, of, roughly, 100, base, pairs, necessary, for, resolving, concatomeric, dna, a, stretch, of, dna, containing, multiple, copies, of, the, same, sequence, a, few, open, reading, frames, and, short, tandemly, repeating, sequences, of, varying, number, and, length, the, itrs, of, poxviridae, vary, in, length, across, strains, and, species, the, coding, sequence, for, most, of, the, viral, proteins, in, variola, major, virus, have, at, least, 90, similarity, with, the, genome, of, vaccinia, a, related, virus, used, for, vaccination, against, smallpox, gene, expression, of, variola, virus, occurs, entirely, within, the, cytoplasm, of, the, host, cell, and, follows, a, distinct, progression, during, infection, after, entry, of, an, infectious, virion, into, a, host, cell, synthesis, of, viral, mrna, can, be, detected, within, 20, minutes, about, half, of, the, viral, genome, is, transcribed, prior, to, the, replication, of, viral, dna, the, first, set, of, expressed, genes, are, transcribed, by, pre, existing, viral, machinery, packaged, within, the, infecting, virion, these, genes, encode, the, factors, necessary, for, viral, dna, synthesis, and, for, transcription, of, the, next, set, of, expressed, genes, unlike, most, dna, viruses, dna, replication, in, variola, virus, and, other, poxviruses, takes, place, within, the, cytoplasm, of, the, infected, cell, the, exact, timing, of, dna, replication, after, infection, of, a, host, cell, varies, across, the, poxviridae, recombination, of, the, genome, occurs, within, actively, infected, cells, following, the, onset, of, viral, dna, replication, an, intermediate, set, of, genes, codes, for, transcription, factors, of, late, gene, expression, the, products, of, the, later, genes, include, transcription, factors, necessary, for, transcribing, the, early, genes, for, new, virions, as, well, as, viral, rna, polymerase, and, other, essential, enzymes, for, new, viral, particles, these, proteins, are, then, packaged, into, new, infectious, virions, capable, of, infecting, other, cells, two, live, samples, of, variola, major, virus, remain, one, in, the, united, states, at, the, cdc, in, atlanta, and, one, at, the, vector, institute, in, koltsovo, russia, research, with, the, remaining, virus, samples, is, tightly, controlled, and, each, research, proposal, must, be, approved, by, the, who, and, the, world, health, assembly, wha, most, research, on, poxviruses, is, performed, using, the, closely, related, vaccinia, virus, as, a, model, organism, vaccinia, virus, which, is, used, to, vaccinate, for, smallpox, is, also, under, research, as, a, viral, vector, for, vaccines, for, unrelated, diseases, the, genome, of, variola, major, virus, was, first, sequenced, in, its, entirety, in, the, 1990s, the, complete, coding, sequence, is, publicly, available, online, the, current, reference, sequence, for, variola, major, virus, was, sequenced, from, a, strain, that, circulated, in, india, in, 1967, in, addition, there, are, sequences, for, samples, of, other, strains, that, were, collected, during, the, who, eradication, campaign, a, genome, browser, for, a, complete, database, of, annotated, sequences, of, variola, virus, and, other, poxviruses, is, publicly, available, through, the, viral, bioinformatics, resource, center, the, who, currently, bans, genetic, engineering, of, the, variola, virus, however, in, 2004, a, committee, advisory, to, the, who, voted, in, favor, of, allowing, editing, of, the, genome, of, the, two, remaining, samples, of, variola, major, virus, to, add, a, marker, gene, this, gene, called, gfp, or, green, fluorescent, protein, would, cause, live, samples, of, the, virus, to, glow, green, under, fluorescent, light, the, insertion, of, this, gene, which, would, not, influence, the, virulence, of, the, virus, would, be, the, only, allowed, modification, of, the, genome, the, committee, stated, the, proposed, modification, would, aid, in, research, of, treatments, by, making, it, easier, to, assess, whether, a, potential, treatment, was, effective, in, killing, viral, samples, the, recommendation, could, only, take, effect, if, approved, by, the, wha, when, the, wha, discussed, the, proposal, in, 2005, it, refrained, from, taking, a, formal, vote, on, the, proposal, stating, that, it, would, review, individual, research, proposals, one, at, a, time, addition, of, the, gfp, gene, to, the, vaccinia, genome, is, routinely, performed, during, research, on, the, closely, related, vaccinia, virus, the, public, availability, of, the, variola, virus, complete, sequence, has, raised, concerns, about, the, possibility, of, illicit, synthesis, of, infectious, virus, vaccinia, a, cousin, of, the, variola, virus, was, artificially, synthesized, in, 2002, by, nih, scientists, they, used, a, previously, established, method, that, involved, using, a, recombinant, viral, genome, to, create, a, self, replicating, bacterial, plasmid, that, produced, viral, particles, in, 2016, another, group, synthesized, the, horsepox, virus, using, publicly, available, sequence, data, for, horsepox, the, researchers, argued, that, their, work, would, be, beneficial, to, creating, a, safer, and, more, effective, vaccine, for, smallpox, although, an, effective, vaccine, is, already, available, the, horsepox, virus, had, previously, seemed, to, have, gone, extinct, raising, concern, about, potential, revival, of, variola, major, and, causing, other, scientists, to, question, their, motives, critics, found, it, especially, concerning, that, the, group, was, able, to, recreate, viable, virus, in, a, short, time, frame, with, relatively, little, cost, or, effort, although, the, who, bans, individual, laboratories, from, synthesizing, more, than, 20, of, the, genome, at, a, time, and, purchases, of, smallpox, genome, fragments, are, monitored, and, regulated, a, group, with, malicious, intentions, could, compile, from, multiple, sources, the, full, synthetic, genome, necessary, to, produce, viable, virus, smallpox, was, highly, contagious, but, generally, spread, more, slowly, and, less, widely, than, some, other, viral, diseases, perhaps, because, transmission, required, close, contact, and, occurred, after, the, onset, of, the, rash, the, overall, rate, of, infection, was, also, affected, by, the, short, duration, of, the, infectious, stage, in, temperate, areas, the, number, of, smallpox, infections, was, highest, during, the, winter, and, spring, in, tropical, areas, seasonal, variation, was, less, evident, and, the, disease, was, present, throughout, the, year, age, distribution, of, smallpox, infections, depended, on, acquired, immunity, vaccination, immunity, declined, over, time, and, was, probably, lost, within, thirty, years, smallpox, was, not, known, to, be, transmitted, by, insects, or, animals, and, there, was, no, asymptomatic, carrier, state, transmission, occurred, through, inhalation, of, airborne, variola, virus, usually, droplets, expressed, from, the, oral, nasal, or, pharyngeal, mucosa, of, an, infected, person, it, was, transmitted, from, one, person, to, another, primarily, through, prolonged, face, to, face, contact, with, an, infected, person, some, infections, of, laundry, workers, with, smallpox, after, handling, contaminated, bedding, suggested, that, smallpox, could, be, spread, through, direct, contact, with, contaminated, objects, fomites, but, this, was, found, to, be, rare, also, rarely, smallpox, was, spread, by, virus, carried, in, the, air, in, enclosed, settings, such, as, buildings, buses, and, trains, the, virus, can, cross, the, placenta, but, the, incidence, of, congenital, smallpox, was, relatively, low, smallpox, was, not, notably, infectious, in, the, prodromal, period, and, viral, shedding, was, usually, delayed, until, the, appearance, of, the, rash, which, was, often, accompanied, by, lesions, in, the, mouth, and, pharynx, the, virus, can, be, transmitted, throughout, the, course, of, the, illness, but, this, happened, most, frequently, during, the, first, week, of, the, rash, when, most, of, the, skin, lesions, were, intact, infectivity, waned, in, 7, to, 10, days, when, scabs, formed, over, the, lesions, but, the, infected, person, was, contagious, until, the, last, smallpox, scab, fell, off, concern, about, possible, use, of, smallpox, for, biological, warfare, led, in, 2002, to, donald, k, milton, s, detailed, review, of, existing, research, on, its, transmission, and, of, then, current, recommendations, for, controlling, its, spread, he, agreed, citing, rao, fenner, and, others, that, careful, epidemiologic, investigation, rarely, implicated, fomites, as, a, source, of, infection, noted, that, current, recommendations, for, control, of, secondary, smallpox, infections, emphasize, transmission, by, expelled, droplets, to, close, contacts, those, within, 6, 7, feet, but, warned, that, the, emphasis, on, spread, via, large, droplets, may, reduce, the, vigilance, with, which, more, difficult, airborne, precautions, are, maintained, once, inhaled, the, variola, virus, invaded, the, mucus, membranes, of, the, mouth, throat, and, respiratory, tract, from, there, it, migrated, to, regional, lymph, nodes, and, began, to, multiply, in, the, initial, growth, phase, the, virus, seemed, to, move, from, cell, to, cell, but, by, around, the, 12th, day, widespread, lysis, of, infected, cells, occurred, and, the, virus, could, be, found, in, the, bloodstream, in, large, numbers, a, condition, known, as, viremia, this, resulted, in, the, second, wave, of, multiplication, in, the, spleen, bone, marrow, and, lymph, nodes, the, clinical, definition, of, ordinary, smallpox, is, an, illness, with, acute, onset, of, fever, equal, to, or, greater, than, 38, 3, c, 101, f, followed, by, a, rash, characterized, by, firm, deep, seated, vesicles, or, pustules, in, the, same, stage, of, development, without, other, apparent, cause, when, a, clinical, case, was, observed, smallpox, was, confirmed, using, laboratory, tests, microscopically, poxviruses, produce, characteristic, cytoplasmic, inclusion, bodies, the, most, important, of, which, are, known, as, guarnieri, bodies, and, are, the, sites, of, viral, replication, guarnieri, bodies, are, readily, identified, in, skin, biopsies, stained, with, hematoxylin, and, eosin, and, appear, as, pink, blobs, they, are, found, in, virtually, all, poxvirus, infections, but, the, absence, of, guarnieri, bodies, could, not, be, used, to, rule, out, smallpox, the, diagnosis, of, an, orthopoxvirus, infection, can, also, be, made, rapidly, by, electron, microscopic, examination, of, pustular, fluid, or, scabs, all, orthopoxviruses, exhibit, identical, brick, shaped, virions, by, electron, microscopy, if, particles, with, the, characteristic, morphology, of, herpesviruses, are, seen, this, will, eliminate, smallpox, and, other, orthopoxvirus, infections, definitive, laboratory, identification, of, variola, virus, involved, growing, the, virus, on, chorioallantoic, membrane, part, of, a, chicken, embryo, and, examining, the, resulting, pock, lesions, under, defined, temperature, conditions, strains, were, characterized, by, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, and, restriction, fragment, length, polymorphism, rflp, analysis, serologic, tests, and, enzyme, linked, immunosorbent, assays, elisa, which, measured, variola, virus, specific, immunoglobulin, and, antigen, were, also, developed, to, assist, in, the, diagnosis, of, infection, chickenpox, was, commonly, confused, with, smallpox, in, the, immediate, post, eradication, era, chickenpox, and, smallpox, could, be, distinguished, by, several, methods, unlike, smallpox, chickenpox, does, not, usually, affect, the, palms, and, soles, additionally, chickenpox, pustules, are, of, varying, size, due, to, variations, in, the, timing, of, pustule, eruption, smallpox, pustules, are, all, very, nearly, the, same, size, since, the, viral, effect, progresses, more, uniformly, a, variety, of, laboratory, methods, were, available, for, detecting, chickenpox, in, the, evaluation, of, suspected, smallpox, cases, the, earliest, procedure, used, to, prevent, smallpox, was, inoculation, with, variola, minor, virus, a, method, later, known, as, variolation, after, the, introduction, of, smallpox, vaccine, to, avoid, possible, confusion, which, likely, occurred, in, india, africa, and, china, well, before, the, practice, arrived, in, europe, the, idea, that, inoculation, originated, in, india, has, been, challenged, as, few, of, the, ancient, sanskrit, medical, texts, described, the, process, of, inoculation, accounts, of, inoculation, against, smallpox, in, china, can, be, found, as, early, as, the, late, 10th, century, and, the, procedure, was, widely, practiced, by, the, 16th, century, during, the, ming, dynasty, if, successful, inoculation, produced, lasting, immunity, to, smallpox, because, the, person, was, infected, with, variola, virus, a, severe, infection, could, result, and, the, person, could, transmit, smallpox, to, others, variolation, had, a, 0, 5, 2, percent, mortality, rate, considerably, less, than, the, 20, 30, percent, mortality, rate, of, smallpox, two, reports, on, the, chinese, practice, of, inoculation, were, received, by, the, royal, society, in, london, in, 1700, one, by, dr, martin, lister, who, received, a, report, by, an, employee, of, the, east, india, company, stationed, in, china, and, another, by, clopton, havers, lady, mary, wortley, montagu, observed, smallpox, inoculation, during, her, stay, in, the, ottoman, empire, writing, detailed, accounts, of, the, practice, in, her, letters, and, enthusiastically, promoted, the, procedure, in, england, upon, her, return, in, 1718, according, to, voltaire, 1742, the, turks, derived, their, use, of, inoculation, from, neighbouring, circassia, voltaire, does, not, speculate, on, where, the, circassians, derived, their, technique, from, though, he, reports, that, the, chinese, have, practiced, it, these, hundred, years, in, 1721, cotton, mather, and, colleagues, provoked, controversy, in, boston, by, inoculating, hundreds, after, publishing, the, present, method, of, inoculating, for, the, small, pox, in, 1767, dr, thomas, dimsdale, was, invited, to, russia, to, variolate, the, empress, catherine, the, great, of, russia, and, her, son, grand, duke, paul, which, he, successfully, did, in, 1768, in, 1796, edward, jenner, a, doctor, in, berkeley, gloucestershire, rural, england, discovered, that, immunity, to, smallpox, could, be, produced, by, inoculating, a, person, with, material, from, a, cowpox, lesion, cowpox, is, a, poxvirus, in, the, same, family, as, variola, jenner, called, the, material, used, for, inoculation, vaccine, from, the, root, word, vacca, which, is, latin, for, cow, the, procedure, was, much, safer, than, variolation, and, did, not, involve, a, risk, of, smallpox, transmission, vaccination, to, prevent, smallpox, was, soon, practiced, all, over, the, world, during, the, 19th, century, the, cowpox, virus, used, for, smallpox, vaccination, was, replaced, by, the, vaccinia, virus, vaccinia, is, in, the, same, family, as, cowpox, and, variola, virus, but, is, genetically, distinct, from, both, the, origin, of, the, vaccinia, virus, and, how, it, came, to, be, in, the, vaccine, are, not, known, the, current, formulation, of, the, smallpox, vaccine, is, a, live, virus, preparation, of, the, infectious, vaccinia, virus, the, vaccine, is, given, using, a, bifurcated, two, pronged, needle, that, is, dipped, into, the, vaccine, solution, the, needle, is, used, to, prick, the, skin, usually, the, upper, arm, several, times, in, a, few, seconds, if, successful, a, red, and, itchy, bump, develops, at, the, vaccine, site, in, three, or, four, days, in, the, first, week, the, bump, becomes, a, large, blister, called, a, jennerian, vesicle, which, fills, with, pus, and, begins, to, drain, during, the, second, week, the, blister, begins, to, dry, up, and, a, scab, forms, the, scab, falls, off, in, the, third, week, leaving, a, small, scar, the, antibodies, induced, by, the, vaccinia, vaccine, are, cross, protective, for, other, orthopoxviruses, such, as, monkeypox, cowpox, and, variola, smallpox, viruses, neutralizing, antibodies, are, detectable, 10, days, after, first, time, vaccination, and, seven, days, after, revaccination, historically, the, vaccine, has, been, effective, in, preventing, smallpox, infection, in, 95, percent, of, those, vaccinated, smallpox, vaccination, provides, a, high, level, of, immunity, for, three, to, five, years, and, decreasing, immunity, thereafter, if, a, person, is, vaccinated, again, later, the, immunity, lasts, even, longer, studies, of, smallpox, cases, in, europe, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, demonstrated, that, the, fatality, rate, among, persons, vaccinated, less, than, 10, years, before, exposure, was, 1, 3, percent, it, was, 7, percent, among, those, vaccinated, 11, to, 20, years, prior, and, 11, percent, among, those, vaccinated, 20, or, more, years, before, infection, by, contrast, 52, percent, of, unvaccinated, persons, died, there, are, side, effects, and, risks, associated, with, the, smallpox, vaccine, in, the, past, about, 1, out, of, 1, 000, people, vaccinated, for, the, first, time, experienced, serious, but, non, life, threatening, reactions, including, toxic, or, allergic, reaction, at, the, site, of, the, vaccination, erythema, multiforme, spread, of, the, vaccinia, virus, to, other, parts, of, the, body, and, spread, to, other, individuals, potentially, life, threatening, reactions, occurred, in, 14, to, 500, people, out, of, every, 1, million, people, vaccinated, for, the, first, time, based, on, past, experience, it, is, estimated, that, 1, or, 2, people, in, 1, million, 0, 000198, percent, who, receive, the, vaccine, may, die, as, a, result, most, often, the, result, of, postvaccinial, encephalitis, or, severe, necrosis, in, the, area, of, vaccination, called, progressive, vaccinia, given, these, risks, as, smallpox, became, effectively, eradicated, and, the, number, of, naturally, occurring, cases, fell, below, the, number, of, vaccine, induced, illnesses, and, deaths, routine, childhood, vaccination, was, discontinued, in, the, united, states, in, 1972, and, was, abandoned, in, most, european, countries, in, the, early, 1970s, routine, vaccination, of, health, care, workers, was, discontinued, in, the, u, s, in, 1976, and, among, military, recruits, in, 1990, although, military, personnel, deploying, to, the, middle, east, and, korea, still, receive, the, vaccination, by, 1986, routine, vaccination, had, ceased, in, all, countries, it, is, now, primarily, recommended, for, laboratory, workers, at, risk, for, occupational, exposure, however, the, possibility, of, variola, virus, being, used, as, a, biological, weapon, has, rekindled, interest, in, the, development, of, newer, vaccines, the, smallpox, vaccine, is, also, effective, in, and, therefore, administered, for, the, prevention, of, mpox, smallpox, vaccination, within, three, days, of, exposure, will, prevent, or, significantly, lessen, the, severity, of, smallpox, symptoms, in, the, vast, majority, of, people, vaccination, four, to, seven, days, after, exposure, can, offer, some, protection, from, disease, or, may, modify, the, severity, of, the, disease, other, than, vaccination, treatment, of, smallpox, is, primarily, supportive, such, as, wound, care, and, infection, control, fluid, therapy, and, possible, ventilator, assistance, flat, and, hemorrhagic, types, of, smallpox, are, treated, with, the, same, therapies, used, to, treat, shock, such, as, fluid, resuscitation, people, with, semi, confluent, and, confluent, types, of, smallpox, may, have, therapeutic, issues, similar, to, patients, with, extensive, skin, burns, in, july, 2018, the, food, and, drug, administration, approved, tecovirimat, the, first, drug, approved, for, treatment, of, smallpox, antiviral, treatments, have, improved, since, the, last, large, smallpox, epidemics, and, studies, suggest, that, the, antiviral, drug, cidofovir, might, be, useful, as, a, therapeutic, agent, the, drug, must, be, administered, intravenously, and, may, cause, serious, kidney, toxicity, acam2000, is, a, smallpox, vaccine, developed, by, acambis, it, was, approved, for, use, in, the, united, states, by, the, u, s, fda, on, august, 31, 2007, it, contains, live, vaccinia, virus, cloned, from, the, same, strain, used, in, an, earlier, vaccine, dryvax, while, the, dryvax, virus, was, cultured, in, the, skin, of, calves, and, freeze, dried, acam2000s, virus, is, cultured, in, kidney, epithelial, cells, vero, cells, from, an, african, green, monkey, efficacy, and, adverse, reaction, incidence, are, similar, to, dryvax, the, vaccine, is, not, routinely, available, to, the, us, public, it, is, however, used, in, the, military, and, maintained, in, the, strategic, national, stockpile, in, june, 2021, brincidofovir, was, approved, for, medical, use, in, the, united, states, for, the, treatment, of, human, smallpox, disease, caused, by, variola, virus, the, mortality, rate, from, variola, minor, is, approximately, 1, while, the, mortality, rate, from, variola, major, is, approximately, 30, ordinary, type, confluent, is, fatal, about, 50, 75, of, the, time, ordinary, type, semi, confluent, about, 25, 50, of, the, time, in, cases, where, the, rash, is, discrete, the, case, fatality, rate, is, less, than, 10, the, overall, fatality, rate, for, children, younger, than, 1, year, of, age, is, 40, 50, hemorrhagic, and, flat, types, have, the, highest, fatality, rates, the, fatality, rate, for, flat, or, late, hemorrhagic, type, smallpox, is, 90, or, greater, and, nearly, 100, is, observed, in, cases, of, early, hemorrhagic, smallpox, the, case, fatality, rate, for, variola, minor, is, 1, or, less, there, is, no, evidence, of, chronic, or, recurrent, infection, with, variola, virus, in, cases, of, flat, smallpox, in, vaccinated, people, the, condition, was, extremely, rare, but, less, lethal, with, one, case, series, showing, a, 67, death, rate, in, fatal, cases, of, ordinary, smallpox, death, usually, occurs, between, days, 10, 16, of, the, illness, the, cause, of, death, from, smallpox, is, not, clear, but, the, infection, is, now, known, to, involve, multiple, organs, circulating, immune, complexes, overwhelming, viremia, or, an, uncontrolled, immune, response, may, be, contributing, factors, in, early, hemorrhagic, smallpox, death, occurs, suddenly, about, six, days, after, the, fever, develops, the, cause, of, death, in, early, hemorrhagic, cases, is, commonly, due, to, heart, failure, and, pulmonary, edema, in, late, hemorrhagic, cases, high, and, sustained, viremia, severe, platelet, loss, and, poor, immune, response, were, often, cited, as, causes, of, death, in, flat, smallpox, modes, of, death, are, similar, to, those, in, burns, with, loss, of, fluid, protein, and, electrolytes, and, fulminating, sepsis, complications, of, smallpox, arise, most, commonly, in, the, respiratory, system, and, range, from, simple, bronchitis, to, fatal, pneumonia, respiratory, complications, tend, to, develop, on, about, the, eighth, day, of, the, illness, and, can, be, either, viral, or, bacterial, in, origin, secondary, bacterial, infection, of, the, skin, is, a, relatively, uncommon, complication, of, smallpox, when, this, occurs, the, fever, usually, remains, elevated, other, complications, include, encephalitis, 1, in, 500, patients, which, is, more, common, in, adults, and, may, cause, temporary, disability, permanent, pitted, scars, most, notably, on, the, face, and, complications, involving, the, eyes, 2, of, all, cases, pustules, can, form, on, the, eyelid, conjunctiva, and, cornea, leading, to, complications, such, as, conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal, ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and, atrophy, of, the, optic, nerve, blindness, results, in, approximately, 35, 40, of, eyes, affected, with, keratitis, and, corneal, ulcer, hemorrhagic, smallpox, can, cause, subconjunctival, and, retinal, hemorrhages, in, 2, 5, of, young, children, with, smallpox, virions, reach, the, joints, and, bone, causing, osteomyelitis, variolosa, bony, lesions, are, symmetrical, most, common, in, the, elbows, legs, and, characteristically, cause, separation, of, the, epiphysis, and, marked, periosteal, reactions, swollen, joints, limit, movement, and, arthritis, may, lead, to, limb, deformities, ankylosis, malformed, bones, flail, joints, and, stubby, fingers, between, 65, and, 80, of, survivors, are, marked, with, deep, pitted, scars, pockmarks, most, prominent, on, the, face, the, earliest, credible, clinical, evidence, of, smallpox, is, found, in, the, descriptions, of, smallpox, like, disease, in, medical, writings, from, ancient, india, as, early, as, 1500, bce, and, china, 1122, bce, as, well, as, a, study, of, the, egyptian, mummy, of, ramses, v, died, 1145, bce, it, has, been, speculated, that, egyptian, traders, brought, smallpox, to, india, during, the, 1st, millennium, bce, where, it, remained, as, an, endemic, human, disease, for, at, least, 2000, years, smallpox, was, probably, introduced, into, china, during, the, 1st, century, ce, from, the, southwest, and, in, the, 6th, century, was, carried, from, china, to, japan, in, japan, the, epidemic, of, 735, 737, is, believed, to, have, killed, as, much, as, one, third, of, the, population, at, least, seven, religious, deities, have, been, specifically, dedicated, to, smallpox, such, as, the, god, sopona, in, the, yoruba, religion, in, west, africa, in, india, the, hindu, goddess, of, smallpox, shitala, was, worshipped, in, temples, throughout, the, country, a, different, viewpoint, is, that, smallpox, emerged, 1588, ce, and, the, earlier, reported, cases, were, incorrectly, identified, as, smallpox, the, timing, of, the, arrival, of, smallpox, in, europe, and, south, western, asia, is, less, clear, smallpox, is, not, clearly, described, in, either, the, old, or, new, testaments, of, the, bible, or, in, the, literature, of, the, greeks, or, romans, while, some, have, identified, the, plague, of, athens, which, was, said, to, have, originated, in, ethiopia, and, egypt, or, the, plague, that, lifted, carthage, s, 396, bce, siege, of, syracuse, with, smallpox, many, scholars, agree, it, is, very, unlikely, such, a, serious, disease, as, variola, major, would, have, escaped, being, described, by, hippocrates, if, it, had, existed, in, the, mediterranean, region, during, his, lifetime, while, the, antonine, plague, that, swept, through, the, roman, empire, in, 165, 180, ce, may, have, been, caused, by, smallpox, saint, nicasius, of, rheims, became, the, patron, saint, of, smallpox, victims, for, having, supposedly, survived, a, bout, in, 450, and, saint, gregory, of, tours, recorded, a, similar, outbreak, in, france, and, italy, in, 580, the, first, use, of, the, term, variola, other, historians, speculate, that, arab, armies, first, carried, smallpox, from, africa, into, southwestern, europe, during, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, in, the, 9th, century, the, persian, physician, rhazes, provided, one, of, the, most, definitive, descriptions, of, smallpox, and, was, the, first, to, differentiate, smallpox, from, measles, and, chickenpox, in, his, kitab, fi, al, jadari, wa, al, hasbah, the, book, of, smallpox, and, measles, during, the, middle, ages, several, smallpox, outbreaks, occurred, in, europe, however, smallpox, had, not, become, established, there, until, the, population, growth, and, mobility, marked, by, the, crusades, allowed, it, to, do, so, by, the, 16th, century, smallpox, had, become, entrenched, across, most, of, europe, where, it, had, a, mortality, rate, as, high, as, 30, percent, this, endemic, occurrence, of, smallpox, in, europe, is, of, particular, historical, importance, as, successive, exploration, and, colonization, by, europeans, tended, to, spread, the, disease, to, other, nations, by, the, 16th, century, smallpox, had, become, a, predominant, cause, of, morbidity, and, mortality, throughout, much, of, the, world, there, were, no, credible, descriptions, of, smallpox, like, disease, in, the, americas, before, the, westward, exploration, by, europeans, in, the, 15th, century, ce, smallpox, was, introduced, into, the, caribbean, island, of, hispaniola, in, 1507, and, into, the, mainland, in, 1520, when, spanish, settlers, from, hispaniola, arrived, in, mexico, inadvertently, carrying, smallpox, with, them, because, the, native, amerindian, population, had, no, acquired, immunity, to, this, new, disease, their, peoples, were, decimated, by, epidemics, such, disruption, and, population, losses, were, an, important, factor, in, the, spanish, achieving, conquest, of, the, aztecs, and, the, incas, similarly, english, settlement, of, the, east, coast, of, north, america, in, 1633, in, plymouth, massachusetts, was, accompanied, by, devastating, outbreaks, of, smallpox, among, native, american, populations, and, subsequently, among, the, native, born, colonists, case, fatality, rates, during, outbreaks, in, native, american, populations, were, as, high, as, 90, smallpox, was, introduced, into, australia, in, 1789, and, again, in, 1829, though, colonial, surgeons, who, by, 1829, were, attempting, to, distinguish, between, smallpox, and, chickenpox, which, could, be, almost, equally, fatal, to, aborigines, were, divided, as, to, whether, the, 1829, 1830, epidemic, was, chickenpox, or, smallpox, although, smallpox, was, never, endemic, on, the, continent, it, has, been, described, as, the, principal, cause, of, death, in, aboriginal, populations, between, 1780, and, 1870, by, the, mid, 18th, century, smallpox, was, a, major, endemic, disease, everywhere, in, the, world, except, in, australia, and, small, islands, untouched, by, outside, exploration, in, 18th, century, europe, smallpox, was, a, leading, cause, of, death, killing, an, estimated, 400, 000, europeans, each, year, up, to, 10, percent, of, swedish, infants, died, of, smallpox, each, year, and, the, death, rate, of, infants, in, russia, might, have, been, even, higher, the, widespread, use, of, variolation, in, a, few, countries, notably, great, britain, its, north, american, colonies, and, china, somewhat, reduced, the, impact, of, smallpox, among, the, wealthy, classes, during, the, latter, part, of, the, 18th, century, but, a, real, reduction, in, its, incidence, did, not, occur, until, vaccination, became, a, common, practice, toward, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, improved, vaccines, and, the, practice, of, re, vaccination, led, to, a, substantial, reduction, in, cases, in, europe, and, north, america, but, smallpox, remained, almost, unchecked, everywhere, else, in, the, world, by, the, mid, 20th, century, variola, minor, occurred, along, with, variola, major, in, varying, proportions, in, many, parts, of, africa, patients, with, variola, minor, experience, only, a, mild, systemic, illness, are, often, ambulant, throughout, the, course, of, the, disease, and, are, therefore, able, to, more, easily, spread, disease, infection, with, variola, minor, virus, induces, immunity, against, the, more, deadly, variola, major, form, thus, as, variola, minor, spread, all, over, the, us, into, canada, the, south, american, countries, and, great, britain, it, became, the, dominant, form, of, smallpox, further, reducing, mortality, rates, the, first, clear, reference, to, smallpox, inoculation, was, made, by, the, chinese, author, wan, quan, 1499, 1582, in, his, d, uzh, n, x, nf, pox, rash, teachings, published, in, 1549, with, earliest, hints, of, the, practice, in, china, during, the, 10th, century, in, china, powdered, smallpox, scabs, were, blown, up, the, noses, of, the, healthy, people, would, then, develop, a, mild, case, of, the, disease, and, from, then, on, were, immune, to, it, the, technique, did, have, a, 0, 5, 2, 0, mortality, rate, but, that, was, considerably, less, than, the, 20, 30, mortality, rate, of, the, disease, itself, two, reports, on, the, chinese, practice, of, inoculation, were, received, by, the, royal, society, in, london, in, 1700, one, by, dr, martin, lister, who, received, a, report, by, an, employee, of, the, east, india, company, stationed, in, china, and, another, by, clopton, havers, voltaire, 1742, reports, that, the, chinese, had, practiced, smallpox, inoculation, these, hundred, years, variolation, had, also, been, witnessed, in, turkey, by, lady, mary, wortley, montagu, who, later, introduced, it, in, the, uk, an, early, mention, of, the, possibility, of, smallpox, s, eradication, was, made, in, reference, to, the, work, of, johnnie, notions, a, self, taught, inoculator, from, shetland, scotland, notions, found, success, in, treating, people, from, at, least, the, late, 1780s, through, a, method, devised, by, himself, despite, having, no, formal, medical, background, his, method, involved, exposing, smallpox, pus, to, peat, smoke, burying, it, in, the, ground, with, camphor, for, up, to, 8, years, and, then, inserting, the, matter, into, a, person, s, skin, using, a, knife, and, covering, the, incision, with, a, cabbage, leaf, he, was, reputed, not, to, have, lost, a, single, patient, arthur, edmondston, in, writings, on, notions, technique, that, were, published, in, 1809, stated, had, every, practitioner, been, as, uniformly, successful, in, the, disease, as, he, was, the, small, pox, might, have, been, banished, from, the, face, of, the, earth, without, injuring, the, system, or, leaving, any, doubt, as, to, the, fact, the, english, physician, edward, jenner, demonstrated, the, effectiveness, of, cowpox, to, protect, humans, from, smallpox, in, 1796, after, which, various, attempts, were, made, to, eliminate, smallpox, on, a, regional, scale, in, russia, in, 1796, the, first, child, to, receive, this, treatment, was, bestowed, the, name, vaccinov, by, catherine, the, great, and, was, educated, at, the, expense, of, the, nation, the, introduction, of, the, vaccine, to, the, new, world, took, place, in, trinity, newfoundland, in, 1800, by, dr, john, clinch, boyhood, friend, and, medical, colleague, of, jenner, as, early, as, 1803, the, spanish, crown, organized, the, balmis, expedition, to, transport, the, vaccine, to, the, spanish, colonies, in, the, americas, and, the, philippines, and, establish, mass, vaccination, programs, there, the, u, s, congress, passed, the, vaccine, act, of, 1813, to, ensure, that, safe, smallpox, vaccine, would, be, available, to, the, american, public, by, about, 1817, a, robust, state, vaccination, program, existed, in, the, dutch, east, indies, on, august, 26, 1807, bavaria, became, the, first, country, in, the, world, to, introduce, compulsory, vaccinations, baden, followed, in, 1809, prussia, in, 1815, w, rttemberg, in, 1818, sweden, in, 1816, and, the, german, empire, in, 1874, through, the, reichs, vaccination, act, in, lutheran, sweden, the, protestant, clergy, played, a, pioneering, role, in, voluntary, smallpox, vaccination, as, early, as, 1800, the, first, vaccination, was, carried, out, in, liechtenstein, in, 1801, and, from, 1812, it, was, mandatory, to, vaccinate, in, british, india, a, program, was, launched, to, propagate, smallpox, vaccination, through, indian, vaccinators, under, the, supervision, of, european, officials, nevertheless, british, vaccination, efforts, in, india, and, in, burma, in, particular, were, hampered, by, indigenous, preference, for, inoculation, and, distrust, of, vaccination, despite, tough, legislation, improvements, in, the, local, efficacy, of, the, vaccine, and, vaccine, preservative, and, education, efforts, by, 1832, the, federal, government, of, the, united, states, established, a, smallpox, vaccination, program, for, native, americans, in, 1842, the, united, kingdom, banned, inoculation, later, progressing, to, mandatory, vaccination, the, british, government, introduced, compulsory, smallpox, vaccination, by, an, act, of, parliament, in, 1853, in, the, united, states, from, 1843, to, 1855, first, massachusetts, and, then, other, states, required, smallpox, vaccination, although, some, disliked, these, measures, coordinated, efforts, against, smallpox, went, on, and, the, disease, continued, to, diminish, in, the, wealthy, countries, in, northern, europe, a, number, of, countries, had, eliminated, smallpox, by, 1900, and, by, 1914, the, incidence, in, most, industrialized, countries, had, decreased, to, comparatively, low, levels, vaccination, continued, in, industrialized, countries, as, protection, against, reintroduction, until, the, mid, to, late, 1970s, australia, and, new, zealand, are, two, notable, exceptions, neither, experienced, endemic, smallpox, and, never, vaccinated, widely, relying, instead, on, protection, by, distance, and, strict, quarantines, the, first, hemisphere, wide, effort, to, eradicate, smallpox, was, made, in, 1950, by, the, pan, american, health, organization, the, campaign, was, successful, in, eliminating, smallpox, from, all, countries, of, the, americas, except, argentina, brazil, colombia, and, ecuador, in, 1958, professor, viktor, zhdanov, deputy, minister, of, health, for, the, ussr, called, on, the, world, health, assembly, to, undertake, a, global, initiative, to, eradicate, smallpox, the, proposal, resolution, wha11, 54, was, accepted, in, 1959, at, this, point, 2, million, people, were, dying, from, smallpox, every, year, overall, the, progress, towards, eradication, was, disappointing, especially, in, africa, and, in, the, indian, subcontinent, in, 1966, an, international, team, the, smallpox, eradication, unit, was, formed, under, the, leadership, of, an, american, donald, henderson, in, 1967, the, world, health, organization, intensified, the, global, smallpox, eradication, by, contributing, 2, 4, million, annually, to, the, effort, and, adopted, the, new, disease, surveillance, method, promoted, by, czech, epidemiologist, karel, ra, ka, in, the, early, 1950s, an, estimated, 50, million, cases, of, smallpox, occurred, in, the, world, each, year, to, eradicate, smallpox, each, outbreak, had, to, be, stopped, from, spreading, by, isolation, of, cases, and, vaccination, of, everyone, who, lived, close, by, this, process, is, known, as, ring, vaccination, the, key, to, this, strategy, was, the, monitoring, of, cases, in, a, community, known, as, surveillance, and, containment, the, initial, problem, the, who, team, faced, was, inadequate, reporting, of, smallpox, cases, as, many, cases, did, not, come, to, the, attention, of, the, authorities, the, fact, that, humans, are, the, only, reservoir, for, smallpox, infection, and, that, carriers, did, not, exist, played, a, significant, role, in, the, eradication, of, smallpox, the, who, established, a, network, of, consultants, who, assisted, countries, in, setting, up, surveillance, and, containment, activities, early, on, donations, of, vaccine, were, provided, primarily, by, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, but, by, 1973, more, than, 80, percent, of, all, vaccine, was, produced, in, developing, countries, the, soviet, union, provided, one, and, a, half, billion, doses, between, 1958, and, 1979, as, well, as, the, medical, staff, the, last, major, european, outbreak, of, smallpox, was, in, 1972, in, yugoslavia, after, a, pilgrim, from, kosovo, returned, from, the, middle, east, where, he, had, contracted, the, virus, the, epidemic, infected, 175, people, causing, 35, deaths, authorities, declared, martial, law, enforced, quarantine, and, undertook, widespread, re, vaccination, of, the, population, enlisting, the, help, of, the, who, in, two, months, the, outbreak, was, over, prior, to, this, there, had, been, a, smallpox, outbreak, in, may, july, 1963, in, stockholm, sweden, brought, from, the, far, east, by, a, swedish, sailor, this, had, been, dealt, with, by, quarantine, measures, and, vaccination, of, the, local, population, by, the, end, of, 1975, smallpox, persisted, only, in, the, horn, of, africa, conditions, were, very, difficult, in, ethiopia, and, somalia, where, there, were, few, roads, civil, war, famine, and, refugees, made, the, task, even, more, difficult, an, intensive, surveillance, containment, and, vaccination, program, was, undertaken, in, these, countries, in, early, and, mid, 1977, under, the, direction, of, australian, microbiologist, frank, fenner, as, the, campaign, neared, its, goal, fenner, and, his, team, played, an, important, role, in, verifying, eradication, the, last, naturally, occurring, case, of, indigenous, smallpox, variola, minor, was, diagnosed, in, ali, maow, maalin, a, hospital, cook, in, merca, somalia, on, 26, october, 1977, the, last, naturally, occurring, case, of, the, more, deadly, variola, major, had, been, detected, in, october, 1975, in, a, three, year, old, bangladeshi, girl, rahima, banu, the, global, eradication, of, smallpox, was, certified, based, on, intense, verification, activities, by, a, commission, of, eminent, scientists, on, 9, december, 1979, and, subsequently, endorsed, by, the, world, health, assembly, on, 8, may, 1980, the, first, two, sentences, of, the, resolution, read, having, considered, the, development, and, results, of, the, global, program, on, smallpox, eradication, initiated, by, who, in, 1958, and, intensified, since, 1967, declares, solemnly, that, the, world, and, its, peoples, have, won, freedom, from, smallpox, which, was, a, most, devastating, disease, sweeping, in, epidemic, form, through, many, countries, since, earliest, time, leaving, death, blindness, and, disfigurement, in, its, wake, and, which, only, a, decade, ago, was, rampant, in, africa, asia, and, south, america, the, cost, of, the, eradication, effort, from, 1967, to, 1979, was, roughly, us, 300, million, roughly, a, third, came, from, the, developed, world, which, had, largely, eradicated, smallpox, decades, earlier, the, united, states, the, largest, contributor, to, the, program, has, reportedly, recouped, that, investment, every, 26, days, since, in, money, not, spent, on, vaccinations, and, the, costs, of, incidence, the, last, case, of, smallpox, in, the, world, occurred, in, an, outbreak, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1978, a, medical, photographer, janet, parker, contracted, the, disease, at, the, university, of, birmingham, medical, school, and, died, on, 11, september, 1978, although, it, has, remained, unclear, how, parker, became, infected, the, source, of, the, infection, was, established, to, be, the, variola, virus, grown, for, research, purposes, at, the, medical, school, laboratory, all, known, stocks, of, smallpox, worldwide, were, subsequently, destroyed, or, transferred, to, two, who, designated, reference, laboratories, with, bsl, 4, facilities, the, united, states, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, and, the, soviet, union, s, now, russia, s, state, research, center, of, virology, and, biotechnology, vector, who, first, recommended, destruction, of, the, virus, in, 1986, and, later, set, the, date, of, destruction, to, be, 30, december, 1993, this, was, postponed, to, 30, june, 1999, due, to, resistance, from, the, u, s, and, russia, in, 2002, the, world, health, assembly, agreed, to, permit, the, temporary, retention, of, the, virus, stocks, for, specific, research, purposes, destroying, existing, stocks, would, reduce, the, risk, involved, with, ongoing, smallpox, research, the, stocks, are, not, needed, to, respond, to, a, smallpox, outbreak, some, scientists, have, argued, that, the, stocks, may, be, useful, in, developing, new, vaccines, antiviral, drugs, and, diagnostic, tests, a, 2010, review, by, a, team, of, public, health, experts, appointed, by, who, concluded, that, no, essential, public, health, purpose, is, served, by, the, u, s, and, russia, continuing, to, retain, virus, stocks, the, latter, view, is, frequently, supported, in, the, scientific, community, particularly, among, veterans, of, the, who, smallpox, eradication, program, on, march, 31, 2003, smallpox, scabs, were, found, inside, an, envelope, in, an, 1888, book, on, civil, war, medicine, in, santa, fe, new, mexico, the, envelope, was, labeled, as, containing, scabs, from, a, vaccination, and, gave, scientists, at, the, cdc, an, opportunity, to, study, the, history, of, smallpox, vaccination, in, the, united, states, on, july, 1, 2014, six, sealed, glass, vials, of, smallpox, dated, 1954, along, with, sample, vials, of, other, pathogens, were, discovered, in, a, cold, storage, room, in, an, fda, laboratory, at, the, national, institutes, of, health, location, in, bethesda, maryland, the, smallpox, vials, were, subsequently, transferred, to, the, custody, of, the, cdc, in, atlanta, where, virus, taken, from, at, least, two, vials, proved, viable, in, culture, after, studies, were, conducted, the, cdc, destroyed, the, virus, under, who, observation, on, february, 24, 2015, in, 2017, scientists, at, the, university, of, alberta, recreated, an, extinct, horse, pox, virus, to, demonstrate, that, the, variola, virus, can, be, recreated, in, a, small, lab, at, a, cost, of, about, 100, 000, by, a, team, of, scientists, without, specialist, knowledge, this, makes, the, retention, controversy, irrelevant, since, the, virus, can, be, easily, recreated, even, if, all, samples, are, destroyed, although, the, scientists, performed, the, research, to, help, development, of, new, vaccines, as, well, as, trace, smallpox, s, history, the, possibility, of, the, techniques, being, used, for, nefarious, purposes, was, immediately, recognized, raising, questions, on, dual, use, research, and, regulations, in, september, 2019, the, russian, lab, housing, smallpox, samples, experienced, a, gas, explosion, that, injured, one, worker, it, did, not, occur, near, the, virus, storage, area, and, no, samples, were, compromised, but, the, incident, prompted, a, review, of, risks, to, containment, in, 1763, pontiac, s, war, broke, out, as, a, native, american, confederacy, led, by, pontiac, attempted, to, counter, british, control, over, the, great, lakes, region, a, group, of, native, american, warriors, laid, siege, to, british, held, fort, pitt, on, june, 22, in, response, henry, bouquet, the, commander, of, the, fort, ordered, his, subordinate, simeon, ecuyer, to, give, smallpox, infested, blankets, from, the, infirmary, to, a, delaware, delegation, outside, the, fort, bouquet, had, discussed, this, with, his, superior, sir, jeffrey, amherst, who, wrote, to, bouquet, stating, could, it, not, be, contrived, to, send, the, small, pox, among, the, disaffected, tribes, of, indians, we, must, on, this, occasion, use, every, stratagem, in, our, power, to, reduce, them, bouquet, agreed, with, the, proposal, writing, back, that, i, will, try, to, inocculate, the, indians, by, means, of, blankets, that, may, fall, in, their, hands, on, 24, june, 1763, william, trent, a, local, trader, and, commander, of, the, fort, pitt, militia, wrote, out, of, our, regard, for, them, we, gave, them, two, blankets, and, an, handkerchief, out, of, the, small, pox, hospital, i, hope, it, will, have, the, desired, effect, the, effectiveness, of, this, effort, to, broadcast, the, disease, is, unknown, there, are, also, accounts, that, smallpox, was, used, as, a, weapon, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, 1775, 1783, according, to, a, theory, put, forward, in, journal, of, australian, studies, jas, by, independent, researcher, christopher, warren, royal, marines, used, smallpox, in, 1789, against, indigenous, tribes, in, new, south, wales, this, theory, was, also, considered, earlier, in, bulletin, of, the, history, of, medicine, and, by, david, day, however, it, is, disputed, by, some, medical, academics, including, professor, jack, carmody, who, in, 2010, claimed, that, the, rapid, spread, of, the, outbreak, in, question, was, more, likely, indicative, of, chickenpox, a, more, infectious, disease, which, at, the, time, was, often, confused, even, by, surgeons, with, smallpox, and, may, have, been, comparably, deadly, to, aborigines, and, other, peoples, without, natural, immunity, to, it, carmody, noted, that, in, the, 8, month, voyage, of, the, first, fleet, and, the, following, 14, months, there, were, no, reports, of, smallpox, amongst, the, colonists, and, that, since, smallpox, has, an, incubation, period, of, 10, 12, days, it, is, unlikely, it, was, present, in, the, first, fleet, however, warren, argued, in, the, jas, article, that, the, likely, source, was, bottles, of, variola, virus, possessed, by, first, fleet, surgeons, ian, and, jennifer, glynn, in, the, life, and, death, of, smallpox, confirm, that, bottles, of, variolous, matter, were, carried, to, australia, for, use, as, a, vaccine, but, think, it, unlikely, the, virus, could, have, survived, till, 1789, in, 2007, christopher, warren, offered, evidence, that, the, british, smallpox, may, have, been, still, viable, however, the, only, non, aborigine, reported, to, have, died, in, this, outbreak, was, a, seaman, called, joseph, jeffries, who, was, recorded, as, being, of, american, indian, origin, w, s, carus, an, expert, in, biological, weapons, has, written, that, there, is, circumstantial, evidence, that, smallpox, was, deliberately, introduced, to, the, aboriginal, population, however, carmody, and, the, australian, national, university, s, boyd, hunter, continue, to, support, the, chickenpox, hypothesis, in, a, 2013, lecture, at, the, australian, national, university, carmody, pointed, out, that, chickenpox, unlike, smallpox, was, known, to, be, present, in, the, sydney, cove, colony, he, also, suggested, that, all, c, 18th, century, and, earlier, identifications, of, smallpox, outbreaks, were, dubious, because, surgeons, would, have, been, unaware, of, the, distinction, between, smallpox, and, chickenpox, the, latter, having, traditionally, been, considered, a, milder, form, of, smallpox, during, world, war, ii, scientists, from, the, united, kingdom, united, states, and, japan, unit, 731, of, the, imperial, japanese, army, were, involved, in, research, into, producing, a, biological, weapon, from, smallpox, plans, of, large, scale, production, were, never, carried, through, as, they, considered, that, the, weapon, would, not, be, very, effective, due, to, the, wide, scale, availability, of, a, vaccine, in, 1947, the, soviet, union, established, a, smallpox, weapons, factory, in, the, city, of, zagorsk, 75, km, to, the, northeast, of, moscow, an, outbreak, of, weaponized, smallpox, occurred, during, testing, at, a, facility, on, an, island, in, the, aral, sea, in, 1971, general, prof, peter, burgasov, former, chief, sanitary, physician, of, the, soviet, army, and, a, senior, researcher, within, the, soviet, program, of, biological, weapons, described, the, incident, on, vozrozhdeniya, island, in, the, aral, sea, the, strongest, recipes, of, smallpox, were, tested, suddenly, i, was, informed, that, there, were, mysterious, cases, of, mortalities, in, aralsk, a, research, ship, of, the, aral, fleet, came, to, within, 15, km, of, the, island, it, was, forbidden, to, come, any, closer, than, 40, km, the, lab, technician, of, this, ship, took, samples, of, plankton, twice, a, day, from, the, top, deck, the, smallpox, formulation, 400, gr, of, which, was, exploded, on, the, island, got, her, and, she, became, infected, after, returning, home, to, aralsk, she, infected, several, people, including, children, all, of, them, died, i, suspected, the, reason, for, this, and, called, the, chief, of, general, staff, of, the, ministry, of, defense, and, requested, to, forbid, the, stop, of, the, alma, ata, moscow, train, in, aralsk, as, a, result, the, epidemic, around, the, country, was, prevented, i, called, andropov, who, at, that, time, was, chief, of, kgb, and, informed, him, of, the, exclusive, recipe, of, smallpox, obtained, on, vozrazhdenie, island, others, contend, that, the, first, patient, may, have, contracted, the, disease, while, visiting, uyaly, or, komsomolsk, on, ustyurt, two, cities, where, the, boat, docked, responding, to, international, pressures, in, 1991, the, soviet, government, allowed, a, joint, u, s, british, inspection, team, to, tour, four, of, its, main, weapons, facilities, at, biopreparat, the, inspectors, were, met, with, evasion, and, denials, from, the, soviet, scientists, and, were, eventually, ordered, out, of, the, facility, in, 1992, soviet, defector, ken, alibek, alleged, that, the, soviet, bioweapons, program, at, zagorsk, had, produced, a, large, stockpile, as, much, as, twenty, tons, of, weaponized, smallpox, possibly, engineered, to, resist, vaccines, alibek, further, alleged, along, with, refrigerated, warheads, to, deliver, it, alibek, s, stories, about, the, former, soviet, program, s, smallpox, activities, have, never, been, independently, verified, in, 1997, the, russian, government, announced, that, all, of, its, remaining, smallpox, samples, would, be, moved, to, the, vector, institute, in, koltsovo, with, the, breakup, of, the, soviet, union, and, unemployment, of, many, of, the, weapons, program, s, scientists, u, s, government, officials, have, expressed, concern, that, smallpox, and, the, expertise, to, weaponize, it, may, have, become, available, to, other, governments, or, terrorist, groups, who, might, wish, to, use, virus, as, means, of, biological, warfare, specific, allegations, made, against, iraq, in, this, respect, proved, to, be, false, famous, historical, figures, who, contracted, smallpox, include, lakota, chief, sitting, bull, ramses, v, the, kangxi, emperor, survived, shunzhi, emperor, and, tongzhi, emperor, of, china, emperor, komei, of, japan, died, of, smallpox, in, 1867, and, date, masamune, of, japan, who, lost, an, eye, to, the, disease, cuitl, huac, the, 10th, tlatoani, ruler, of, the, aztec, city, of, tenochtitlan, died, of, smallpox, in, 1520, shortly, after, its, introduction, to, the, americas, and, the, incan, emperor, huayna, capac, died, of, it, in, 1527, causing, a, civil, war, of, succession, in, the, inca, empire, and, the, eventual, conquest, by, the, spaniards, more, recent, public, figures, include, guru, har, krishan, 8th, guru, of, the, sikhs, in, 1664, louis, i, of, spain, in, 1724, died, peter, ii, of, russia, in, 1730, died, george, washington, survived, louis, xv, of, france, in, 1774, died, and, maximilian, iii, joseph, of, bavaria, in, 1777, died, prominent, families, throughout, the, world, often, had, several, people, infected, by, and, or, perish, from, the, disease, for, example, several, relatives, of, henry, viii, of, england, survived, the, disease, but, were, scarred, by, it, these, include, his, sister, margaret, his, wife, anne, of, cleves, and, his, two, daughters, mary, i, in, 1527, and, elizabeth, i, in, 1562, elizabeth, tried, to, disguise, the, pockmarks, with, heavy, makeup, mary, queen, of, scots, contracted, the, disease, as, a, child, but, had, no, visible, scarring, in, europe, deaths,
