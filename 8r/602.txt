birds, of, prey, or, predatory, birds, also, known, as, raptors, are, hypercarnivorous, bird, species, that, actively, hunt, and, feed, on, other, vertebrates, mainly, mammals, reptiles, and, other, smaller, birds, in, addition, to, speed, and, strength, these, predators, have, keen, eyesight, for, detecting, prey, from, a, distance, or, during, flight, strong, feet, with, sharp, talons, for, grasping, or, killing, prey, and, powerful, curved, beaks, for, tearing, off, flesh, although, predatory, birds, primarily, hunt, live, prey, many, species, such, as, fish, eagles, vultures, and, condors, also, scavenge, and, eat, carrion, although, the, term, bird, of, prey, could, theoretically, be, taken, to, include, all, birds, that, actively, hunt, and, eat, other, animals, ornithologists, typically, use, the, narrower, definition, followed, in, this, page, excluding, many, piscivorous, predators, such, as, storks, cranes, herons, gulls, skuas, penguins, and, kingfishers, as, well, as, many, primarily, insectivorous, birds, such, as, passerines, e, g, shrikes, nightjars, frogmouths, songbirds, such, as, crows, and, ravens, alongside, opportunistic, predators, from, predominantly, frugivorous, or, herbivorous, ratites, such, as, cassowaries, and, rheas, some, extinct, predatory, birds, had, talons, similar, to, those, of, modern, birds, of, prey, including, mousebird, relatives, sandcoleidae, messelasturidae, and, some, enantiornithes, indicating, possible, convergent, evolution, in, some, cases, and, common, descent, in, others, the, term, raptor, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, rapio, meaning, to, seize, or, take, by, force, the, common, names, for, various, birds, of, prey, are, based, on, structure, but, many, of, the, traditional, names, do, not, reflect, the, evolutionary, relationships, between, the, groups, many, of, these, english, language, group, names, originally, referred, to, particular, species, encountered, in, britain, as, english, speaking, people, travelled, further, the, familiar, names, were, applied, to, new, birds, with, similar, characteristics, names, that, have, generalised, this, way, include, kite, milvus, milvus, sparrowhawk, or, sparhawk, accipiter, nisus, goshawk, accipiter, gentilis, kestrel, falco, tinninculus, hobby, falco, subbuteo, harrier, simplified, from, hen, harrier, circus, cyaneus, buzzard, buteo, buteo, some, names, have, not, generalised, and, refer, to, single, species, or, groups, of, closely, related, sub, species, such, as, the, merlin, falco, columbarius, the, taxonomy, of, carl, linnaeus, grouped, birds, class, aves, into, orders, genera, and, species, with, no, formal, ranks, between, genus, and, order, he, placed, all, birds, of, prey, into, a, single, order, accipitres, subdividing, this, into, four, genera, vultur, vultures, falco, eagles, hawks, falcons, etc, strix, owls, and, lanius, shrikes, this, approach, was, followed, by, subsequent, authors, such, as, gmelin, latham, and, turton, louis, pierre, vieillot, used, additional, ranks, order, tribe, family, genus, species, birds, of, prey, order, accipitres, were, divided, into, diurnal, and, nocturnal, tribes, the, owls, remained, monogeneric, family, golii, genus, strix, whilst, the, diurnal, raptors, were, divided, into, three, families, vulturini, gypa, ti, and, accipitrini, thus, vieillot, s, families, were, similar, to, the, linnaean, genera, with, the, difference, that, shrikes, were, no, longer, included, amongst, the, birds, of, prey, in, addition, to, the, original, vultur, and, falco, now, reduced, in, scope, vieillot, adopted, four, genera, from, savigny, phene, hali, etus, pandion, and, elanus, he, also, introduced, five, new, genera, of, vultures, gypagus, catharista, daptrius, ibycter, polyborus, and, eleven, new, genera, of, accipitrines, aquila, circa, tus, circus, buteo, milvus, ictinia, physeta, harpia, spiza, tus, asturina, sparvius, falconimorphae, is, a, deprecated, superorder, within, raptores, formerly, composed, of, the, orders, falconiformes, and, strigiformes, the, clade, was, invalidated, after, 2012, falconiformes, is, now, placed, in, eufalconimorphae, while, strigiformes, is, placed, in, afroaves, the, order, accipitriformes, is, believed, to, have, originated, 44, million, years, ago, when, it, split, from, the, common, ancestor, of, the, secretarybird, sagittarius, serpentarius, and, the, accipitrid, species, the, phylogeny, of, accipitriformes, is, complex, and, difficult, to, unravel, widespread, paraphylies, were, observed, in, many, phylogenetic, studies, more, recent, and, detailed, studies, show, similar, results, however, according, to, the, findings, of, a, 2014, study, the, sister, relationship, between, larger, clades, of, accipitriformes, was, well, supported, e, g, relationship, of, harpagus, kites, to, buzzards, and, sea, eagles, and, these, latter, two, with, accipiter, hawks, are, sister, taxa, of, the, clade, containing, aquilinae, and, harpiinae, the, diurnal, birds, of, prey, are, formally, classified, into, six, families, of, three, different, orders, accipitriformes, falconiformes, and, cariamiformes, these, families, with, the, exception, of, cariamidae, were, traditionally, grouped, together, in, a, single, order, falconiformes, but, are, now, split, into, two, orders, the, falconiformes, and, accipitriformes, the, cathartidae, are, sometimes, placed, separately, in, an, enlarged, stork, family, ciconiiformes, and, may, be, raised, to, an, order, of, their, own, cathartiiformes, the, secretary, bird, and, or, osprey, are, sometimes, listed, as, subfamilies, of, acciptridae, sagittariinae, and, pandioninae, respectively, australia, s, letter, winged, kite, is, a, member, of, the, family, accipitridae, although, it, is, a, nocturnal, bird, the, nocturnal, birds, of, prey, the, owls, are, classified, separately, as, members, of, two, extant, families, of, the, order, strigiformes, below, is, a, simplified, phylogeny, of, telluraves, which, is, the, clade, where, the, birds, of, prey, belong, to, along, with, passerines, and, several, near, passerine, lineages, the, orders, in, bold, text, are, birds, of, prey, orders, this, is, to, show, the, paraphyly, of, the, group, as, well, as, their, relationships, to, other, birds, accipitriformes, hawks, and, relatives, cathartiformes, new, world, vultures, strigiformes, owls, coraciimorphae, woodpeckers, rollers, hornbills, etc, cariamiformes, seriemas, falconiformes, falcons, psittacopasserae, parrots, and, songbirds, a, recent, phylogenomic, study, from, wu, et, al, 2024, has, found, an, alternative, phylogeny, for, the, placement, of, the, birds, of, prey, their, analysis, has, found, support, in, a, clade, consisting, of, the, strigiformes, and, accipitrimorphae, in, new, clade, hieraves, hieraves, was, also, recovered, to, be, the, sister, clade, to, australaves, which, it, includes, the, cariamiformes, and, falconiformes, along, with, psittacopasserae, below, is, their, phylogeny, from, the, study, coraciimorphae, woodpeckers, rollers, hornbills, etc, strigiformes, owls, accipitriformes, hawks, and, relatives, cathartiformes, new, world, vultures, cariamiformes, seriemas, falconiformes, falcons, psittacopasserae, parrots, and, songbirds, migratory, behaviour, evolved, multiple, times, within, accipitrid, raptors, the, earliest, event, occurred, nearly, 14, to, 12, million, years, ago, this, result, seems, to, be, one, of, the, oldest, dates, published, so, far, in, the, case, of, birds, of, prey, for, example, a, previous, reconstruction, of, migratory, behaviour, in, one, buteo, clade, with, a, result, of, the, origin, of, migration, around, 5, million, years, ago, was, also, supported, by, that, study, migratory, species, of, raptors, may, have, had, a, southern, origin, because, it, seems, that, all, of, the, major, lineages, within, accipitridae, had, an, origin, in, one, of, the, biogeographic, realms, of, the, southern, hemisphere, the, appearance, of, migratory, behaviour, occurred, in, the, tropics, parallel, with, the, range, expansion, of, migratory, species, to, temperate, habitats, similar, results, of, southern, origin, in, other, taxonomic, groups, can, be, found, in, the, literature, distribution, and, biogeographic, history, highly, determine, the, origin, of, migration, in, birds, of, prey, based, on, some, comparative, analyses, diet, breadth, also, has, an, effect, on, the, evolution, of, migratory, behaviour, in, this, group, but, its, relevance, needs, further, investigation, the, evolution, of, migration, in, animals, seems, to, be, a, complex, and, difficult, topic, with, many, unanswered, questions, a, recent, study, discovered, new, connections, between, migration, and, the, ecology, life, history, of, raptors, a, brief, overview, from, abstract, of, the, published, paper, shows, that, clutch, size, and, hunting, strategies, have, been, proved, to, be, the, most, important, variables, in, shaping, distribution, areas, and, also, the, geographic, dissimilarities, may, mask, important, relationships, between, life, history, traits, and, migratory, behaviours, the, west, palearctic, afrotropical, and, the, north, south, american, migratory, systems, are, fundamentally, different, from, the, east, palearctic, indomalayan, system, owing, to, the, presence, versus, absence, of, ecological, barriers, maximum, entropy, modelling, can, help, in, answering, the, question, why, species, winters, at, one, location, while, the, others, are, elsewhere, temperature, and, precipitation, related, factors, differ, in, the, limitation, of, species, distributions, this, suggests, that, the, migratory, behaviours, differ, among, the, three, main, migratory, routes, for, these, species, which, may, have, important, conservational, consequences, in, the, protection, of, migratory, raptors, birds, of, prey, raptors, are, known, to, display, patterns, of, sexual, dimorphism, it, is, commonly, believed, that, the, dimorphisms, found, in, raptors, occur, due, to, sexual, selection, or, environmental, factors, in, general, hypotheses, in, favor, of, ecological, factors, being, the, cause, for, sexual, dimorphism, in, raptors, are, rejected, this, is, because, the, ecological, model, is, less, parsimonious, meaning, that, its, explanation, is, more, complex, than, that, of, the, sexual, selection, model, additionally, ecological, models, are, much, harder, to, test, because, a, great, deal, of, data, is, required, dimorphisms, can, also, be, the, product, of, intrasexual, selection, between, males, and, females, it, appears, that, both, sexes, of, the, species, play, a, role, in, the, sexual, dimorphism, within, raptors, females, tend, to, compete, with, other, females, to, find, good, places, to, nest, and, attract, males, and, males, competing, with, other, males, for, adequate, hunting, ground, so, they, appear, as, the, most, healthy, mate, it, has, also, been, proposed, that, sexual, dimorphism, is, merely, the, product, of, disruptive, selection, and, is, merely, a, stepping, stone, in, the, process, of, speciation, especially, if, the, traits, that, define, gender, are, independent, across, a, species, sexual, dimorphism, can, be, viewed, as, something, that, can, accelerate, the, rate, of, speciation, in, non, predatory, birds, males, are, typically, larger, than, females, however, in, birds, of, prey, the, opposite, is, the, case, for, instance, the, kestrel, is, a, type, of, falcon, in, which, males, are, the, primary, providers, and, the, females, are, responsible, for, nurturing, the, young, in, this, species, the, smaller, the, kestrels, are, the, less, food, is, needed, and, thus, they, can, survive, in, environments, that, are, harsher, this, is, particularly, true, in, the, male, kestrels, it, has, become, more, energetically, favorable, for, male, kestrels, to, remain, smaller, than, their, female, counterparts, because, smaller, males, have, an, agility, advantage, when, it, comes, to, defending, the, nest, and, hunting, larger, females, are, favored, because, they, can, incubate, larger, numbers, of, offspring, while, also, being, able, to, brood, a, larger, clutch, size, it, is, a, long, standing, belief, that, birds, lack, any, sense, of, smell, but, it, has, become, clear, that, many, birds, do, have, functional, olfactory, systems, despite, this, most, raptors, are, still, considered, to, primarily, rely, on, vision, with, raptor, vision, being, extensively, studied, a, 2020, review, of, the, existing, literature, combining, anatomical, genetic, and, behavioural, studies, showed, that, in, general, raptors, have, functional, olfactory, systems, that, they, are, likely, to, use, in, a, range, of, different, contexts, birds, of, prey, have, been, historically, persecuted, both, directly, and, indirectly, in, the, danish, faroe, islands, there, were, rewards, naebbetold, by, royal, decree, from, 1741, given, in, return, for, the, bills, of, birds, of, prey, shown, by, hunters, in, britain, kites, and, buzzards, were, seen, as, destroyers, of, game, and, killed, for, instance, in, 1684, 5, alone, as, many, as, 100, kites, were, killed, rewards, for, their, killing, were, also, in, force, in, the, netherlands, from, 1756, from, 1705, to, 1800, it, has, been, estimated, that, 624087, birds, of, prey, were, killed, in, a, part, of, germany, that, included, hannover, luneburg, lauenburg, and, bremen, with, 14125, claws, deposited, just, in, 1796, 97, many, species, also, develop, lead, poisoning, after, accidental, consumption, of, lead, shot, when, feeding, on, animals, that, had, been, shot, by, hunters, lead, pellets, from, direct, shooting, that, the, birds, have, escaped, from, also, cause, reduced, fitness, and, premature, deaths, some, evidence, supports, the, contention, that, the, african, crowned, eagle, occasionally, views, human, children, as, prey, with, a, witness, account, of, one, attack, in, which, the, victim, a, seven, year, old, boy, survived, and, the, eagle, was, killed, and, the, discovery, of, part, of, a, human, child, skull, in, a, nest, this, would, make, it, the, only, living, bird, known, to, prey, on, humans, although, other, birds, such, as, ostriches, and, cassowaries, have, killed, humans, in, self, defense, and, a, lammergeier, might, have, killed, aeschylus, by, accident, many, stories, of, brazilian, indigenous, peoples, speak, about, children, mauled, by, uiruuet, the, harpy, eagle, in, tupi, language, various, large, raptors, like, golden, eagles, are, reported, attacking, human, beings, but, its, unclear, if, they, intend, to, eat, them, or, if, they, have, ever, been, successful, in, killing, one, some, fossil, evidence, indicates, large, birds, of, prey, occasionally, preyed, on, prehistoric, hominids, the, taung, child, an, early, human, found, in, africa, is, believed, to, have, been, killed, by, an, eagle, like, bird, similar, to, the, crowned, eagle, the, haast, s, eagle, may, have, preyed, on, early, humans, in, new, zealand, and, this, conclusion, would, be, consistent, with, maori, folklore, leptoptilos, robustus, might, have, preyed, on, both, homo, floresiensis, and, anatomically, modern, humans, and, the, malagasy, crowned, eagle, teratorns, woodward, s, eagle, and, caracara, major, are, similar, in, size, to, the, haast, s, eagle, implying, that, they, similarly, could, pose, a, threat, to, a, human, being, birds, of, prey, have, incredible, vision, and, rely, heavily, on, it, for, a, number, of, tasks, they, utilize, their, high, visual, acuity, to, obtain, food, navigate, their, surroundings, distinguish, and, flee, from, predators, mating, nest, construction, and, much, more, they, accomplish, these, tasks, with, a, large, eye, in, relation, to, their, skull, which, allows, for, a, larger, image, to, be, projected, onto, the, retina, the, visual, acuity, of, some, large, raptors, such, as, eagles, and, old, world, vultures, are, the, highest, known, among, vertebrates, the, wedge, tailed, eagle, has, twice, the, visual, acuity, of, a, typical, human, and, six, times, that, of, the, common, ostrich, the, vertebrate, with, the, largest, eyes, there, are, two, regions, in, the, retina, called, the, deep, and, shallow, fovea, that, are, specialized, for, acute, vision, these, regions, contain, the, highest, density, of, photoreceptors, and, provide, the, highest, points, of, visual, acuity, the, deep, fovea, points, forward, at, an, approximate, 45, angle, while, the, shallow, fovea, points, approximately, 15, to, the, right, or, left, of, the, head, axis, several, raptor, species, repeatedly, cock, their, heads, into, three, distinct, positions, while, observing, an, object, first, is, straight, ahead, with, their, head, pointed, towards, the, object, second, and, third, are, sideways, to, the, right, or, left, of, the, object, with, their, head, axis, positioned, approximately, 40, adjacent, to, the, object, this, movement, is, believed, to, be, associated, with, lining, up, the, incoming, image, to, fall, on, the, deep, fovea, raptors, will, choose, which, head, position, to, use, depending, on, the, distance, to, the, object, at, distances, as, close, as, 8m, they, used, primarily, binocular, vision, at, distances, greater, than, 21m, they, spent, more, time, using, monocular, vision, at, distances, greater, than, 40m, they, spent, 80, or, more, time, using, their, monocular, vision, this, suggests, that, raptors, tilt, their, head, to, rely, on, the, highly, acute, deep, fovea, like, all, birds, raptors, possess, tetrachromacy, however, due, to, their, emphasis, on, visual, acuity, many, diurnal, birds, of, prey, have, little, ability, to, see, ultraviolet, light, as, this, produces, chromatic, aberration, which, decreases, the, clarity, of, vision
