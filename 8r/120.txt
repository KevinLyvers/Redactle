a, testicle, or, testis, pl, testes, is, the, male, gonad, in, all, bilaterians, including, humans, it, is, homologous, to, the, female, ovary, the, functions, of, the, testicles, are, to, produce, both, sperm, and, androgens, primarily, testosterone, testosterone, release, is, controlled, by, the, anterior, pituitary, luteinizing, hormone, whereas, sperm, production, is, controlled, both, by, the, anterior, pituitary, follicle, stimulating, hormone, and, gonadal, testosterone, males, have, two, testicles, of, similar, size, contained, within, the, scrotum, which, is, an, extension, of, the, abdominal, wall, scrotal, asymmetry, in, which, one, testicle, extends, farther, down, into, the, scrotum, than, the, other, is, common, this, is, because, of, the, differences, in, the, vasculature, s, anatomy, for, 85, of, men, the, right, testis, hangs, lower, than, the, left, one, the, volume, of, the, testicle, can, be, estimated, by, palpating, it, and, comparing, it, to, ellipsoids, an, orchidometer, of, known, sizes, another, method, is, to, use, calipers, a, ruler, or, an, ultrasound, image, to, obtain, the, three, measurements, of, the, x, y, and, z, axes, length, depth, and, width, these, measurements, can, then, be, used, to, calculate, the, volume, using, the, formula, for, the, volume, of, an, ellipsoid, however, the, most, accurate, calculation, of, actual, testicular, volume, is, gained, from, the, formula, an, average, adult, testicle, measures, up, to, 5, cm, 2, cm, 3, cm, 2, in, 3, 4, in, 1, 1, 4, in, the, tanner, scale, which, is, used, to, assess, the, maturity, of, the, male, genitalia, assigns, a, maturity, stage, to, the, calculated, volume, ranging, from, stage, i, a, volume, of, less, than, 1, 5, cm, 3, to, stage, v, a, volume, greater, than, 20, cm, 3, normal, volume, is, 15, to, 25, cm, 3, the, average, is, 18, cm, 3, per, testis, range, 12, 30, cm, 3, the, number, of, spermatozoa, an, adult, human, male, produces, is, directly, proportional, to, testicular, volume, as, larger, testicles, contain, more, seminiferous, tubules, and, sertoli, cells, as, a, result, as, such, men, with, larger, testicles, produce, on, average, more, sperm, cells, in, each, ejaculate, as, testicular, volume, is, positively, correlated, with, semen, profiles, the, testes, are, covered, by, a, tough, fibrous, shell, called, the, tunica, albuginea, under, the, tunica, albuginea, the, testes, contain, very, fine, coiled, tubes, called, seminiferous, tubules, the, tubules, are, lined, with, a, layer, of, cells, germ, cells, that, develop, from, puberty, through, old, age, into, sperm, cells, also, known, as, spermatozoa, or, male, gametes, the, developing, sperm, travel, through, the, seminiferous, tubules, to, the, rete, testis, located, in, the, mediastinum, testis, to, the, efferent, ducts, and, then, to, the, epididymis, where, newly, created, sperm, cells, mature, spermatogenesis, the, sperm, move, into, the, vas, deferens, and, are, eventually, expelled, through, the, urethra, and, out, of, the, urethral, orifice, through, muscular, contractions, within, the, seminiferous, tubules, the, germ, cells, develop, into, spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, and, spermatozoa, through, the, process, of, spermatogenesis, the, gametes, contain, dna, for, fertilization, of, an, ovum, sertoli, cells, the, true, epithelium, of, the, seminiferous, epithelium, critical, for, the, support, of, germ, cell, development, into, spermatozoa, sertoli, cells, secrete, inhibin, peritubular, myoid, cells, surround, the, seminiferous, tubules, between, tubules, interstitial, cells, exist, leydig, cells, cells, localized, between, seminiferous, tubules, that, produce, and, secrete, testosterone, and, other, androgens, important, for, puberty, including, secondary, sexual, characteristics, like, facial, hair, sexual, behavior, and, libido, sertoli, cells, support, spermatogenesis, testosterone, controls, testicular, volume, immature, leydig, cells, and, interstitial, macrophages, and, epithelial, cells, are, also, present, the, testis, has, three, sources, of, arterial, blood, supply, the, testicular, artery, the, cremasteric, artery, and, the, artery, to, the, ductus, deferens, blood, supply, and, lymphatic, drainage, of, the, testes, and, scrotum, are, distinct, many, anatomical, features, of, the, adult, testis, reflect, its, developmental, origin, in, the, abdomen, the, layers, of, tissue, enclosing, each, testicle, are, derived, from, the, layers, of, the, anterior, abdominal, wall, the, cremasteric, muscle, arises, from, the, internal, oblique, muscle, large, molecules, cannot, pass, from, the, blood, into, the, lumen, of, a, seminiferous, tubule, due, to, the, presence, of, tight, junctions, between, adjacent, sertoli, cells, the, spermatogonia, occupy, the, basal, compartment, deep, to, the, level, of, the, tight, junctions, and, the, more, mature, forms, such, as, primary, and, secondary, spermatocytes, and, spermatids, occupy, the, adluminal, compartment, the, function, of, the, blood, testis, barrier, may, be, to, prevent, an, auto, immune, reaction, mature, sperm, and, their, antigens, emerge, significantly, after, immune, tolerance, is, set, in, infancy, since, sperm, are, antigenically, different, from, self, tissue, a, male, animal, can, react, immunologically, to, his, own, sperm, the, male, can, make, antibodies, against, them, injection, of, sperm, antigens, causes, inflammation, of, the, testis, auto, immune, orchitis, and, reduced, fertility, the, blood, testis, barrier, may, reduce, the, likelihood, that, sperm, proteins, will, induce, an, immune, response, carl, richard, moore, in, 1926, proposed, that, testicles, were, external, due, to, spermatogenesis, being, enhanced, at, temperatures, slightly, less, than, core, body, temperature, outside, the, body, the, spermatogenesis, is, less, efficient, at, lower, and, higher, temperatures, than, 33, c, because, the, testes, are, located, outside, the, body, the, smooth, tissue, of, the, scrotum, can, move, them, closer, or, further, away, from, the, body, the, temperature, of, the, testes, is, maintained, at, 34, 4, c, a, little, below, body, temperature, as, temperatures, above, 36, 7, c, impede, spermatogenesis, there, are, a, number, of, mechanisms, to, maintain, the, testes, at, the, optimum, temperature, the, cremasteric, muscle, covers, the, testicles, and, the, spermatic, cord, when, this, muscle, contracts, the, cord, shortens, and, the, testicles, move, closer, up, toward, the, body, which, provides, slightly, more, warmth, to, maintain, optimal, testicular, temperature, when, cooling, is, required, the, cremasteric, muscle, relaxes, and, the, testicles, lower, away, from, the, warm, body, and, are, able, to, cool, contraction, also, occurs, in, response, to, physical, stress, such, as, blunt, trauma, the, testicles, withdraw, and, the, scrotum, shrinks, very, close, to, the, body, in, an, effort, to, protect, them, the, cremasteric, reflex, will, reflexively, raise, the, testicles, the, testicles, can, also, be, lifted, voluntarily, using, the, pubococcygeus, muscle, which, partially, activates, related, muscles, the, human, genome, includes, approximately, 20, 000, protein, coding, genes, 80, of, these, genes, are, expressed, in, adult, testes, the, testes, have, the, highest, fraction, of, tissue, type, specific, genes, compared, to, other, organs, and, tissues, about, 1000, of, them, are, highly, specific, for, the, testes, and, about, 2, 200, show, an, elevated, pattern, of, expression, a, majority, of, these, genes, encode, for, proteins, that, are, expressed, in, the, seminiferous, tubules, and, have, functions, related, to, spermatogenesis, sperm, cells, express, proteins, that, result, in, the, development, of, flagella, these, same, proteins, are, expressed, in, the, female, in, cells, lining, the, fallopian, tube, and, cause, the, development, of, cilia, sperm, cell, flagella, and, fallopian, tube, cilia, are, homologous, structures, the, testis, specific, proteins, that, show, the, highest, level, of, expression, are, protamines, there, are, two, phases, in, which, the, testes, grow, substantially, these, are, the, embryonic, and, pubertal, phases, during, mammalian, development, the, gonads, are, at, first, capable, of, becoming, either, ovaries, or, testes, in, humans, starting, at, about, week, 4, the, gonadal, rudiments, are, present, within, the, intermediate, mesoderm, adjacent, to, the, developing, kidneys, at, about, week, 6, sex, cords, develop, within, the, forming, testes, these, are, made, up, of, early, sertoli, cells, that, surround, and, nurture, the, germ, cells, that, migrate, into, the, gonads, shortly, before, sex, determination, begins, in, males, the, sex, specific, gene, sry, that, is, found, on, the, y, chromosome, initiates, sex, determination, by, downstream, regulation, of, sex, determining, factors, such, as, gata4, sox9, and, amh, which, lead, to, development, of, the, male, phenotype, including, directing, development, of, the, early, bipotential, gonad, toward, the, male, path, of, development, testes, follow, the, path, of, descent, from, high, in, the, posterior, fetal, abdomen, to, the, inguinal, ring, and, beyond, to, the, inguinal, canal, and, into, the, scrotum, in, most, cases, 97, full, term, 70, preterm, both, testes, have, descended, by, birth, in, most, other, cases, only, one, testis, fails, to, descend, this, is, called, cryptorchidism, in, most, cases, of, cryptorchidism, the, issue, will, mostly, resolve, itself, within, the, first, half, year, of, life, however, if, the, testes, do, not, descend, far, enough, into, the, scrotum, surgical, anchoring, in, the, scrotum, is, required, due, to, risks, of, infertility, and, testicular, cancer, the, testes, grow, in, response, to, the, start, of, spermatogenesis, size, depends, on, lytic, function, sperm, production, amount, of, spermatogenesis, present, in, testis, interstitial, fluid, and, sertoli, cell, fluid, production, the, testicles, are, fully, descended, before, the, male, reaches, puberty, testicular, prostheses, are, available, to, mimic, the, appearance, and, feel, of, one, or, both, testicles, when, absent, as, from, injury, or, as, treatment, in, association, to, gender, dysphoria, there, have, also, been, some, instances, of, their, implantation, in, dogs, scientists, are, working, on, developing, lab, grown, testicles, that, might, help, infertile, men, in, the, future, to, some, extent, it, is, possible, to, change, testicular, size, short, of, direct, injury, or, subjecting, them, to, adverse, conditions, e, g, higher, temperature, than, they, are, normally, accustomed, to, they, can, be, shrunk, by, competing, against, their, intrinsic, hormonal, function, through, the, use, of, externally, administered, steroidal, hormones, steroids, taken, for, muscle, enhancement, especially, anabolic, steroids, often, have, the, undesired, side, effect, of, testicular, shrinkage, stimulation, of, testicular, functions, via, gonadotropic, like, hormones, may, enlarge, their, size, testes, may, shrink, or, atrophy, during, hormone, replacement, therapy, or, through, chemical, castration, in, all, cases, the, loss, in, testes, volume, corresponds, with, a, loss, of, spermatogenesis, the, testicles, of, calves, lambs, roosters, turkeys, and, other, animals, are, eaten, in, many, parts, of, the, world, often, under, euphemistic, culinary, names, testicles, are, a, by, product, of, the, castration, of, young, animals, raised, for, meat, so, they, might, have, been, a, late, spring, seasonal, specialty, in, modern, times, they, are, generally, frozen, and, available, year, round, in, the, middle, ages, men, who, wanted, a, boy, sometimes, had, their, left, testicle, removed, this, was, because, people, believed, that, the, right, testicle, made, boy, sperm, and, the, left, made, girl, sperm, as, early, as, 330, bc, aristotle, prescribed, the, ligation, tying, off, of, the, left, testicle, in, men, wishing, to, have, boys, one, theory, about, the, etymology, of, the, word, testis, is, based, on, roman, law, the, original, latin, word, testis, witness, was, used, in, the, firmly, established, legal, principle, testis, unus, testis, nullus, one, witness, no, witness, meaning, that, testimony, by, any, one, person, in, court, was, to, be, disregarded, unless, corroborated, by, the, testimony, of, at, least, another, this, led, to, the, common, practice, of, producing, two, witnesses, bribed, to, testify, the, same, way, in, cases, of, lawsuits, with, ulterior, motives, since, such, witnesses, always, came, in, pairs, the, meaning, was, accordingly, extended, often, in, the, diminutive, testiculus, testiculi, another, theory, says, that, testis, is, influenced, by, a, loan, translation, from, greek, parastat, s, defender, in, law, supporter, that, is, two, glands, side, by, side, there, are, multiple, slang, terms, for, the, testes, they, may, be, referred, to, as, balls, frequently, nuts, sometimes, intentionally, misspelled, as, nutz, are, also, a, slang, term, for, the, testes, due, to, the, geometric, resemblance, one, variant, of, the, term, includes, deez, nuts, which, was, used, for, a, satirical, political, candidate, in, 2016, in, spanish, the, term, huevos, is, used, which, is, spanish, for, eggs, in, seasonal, breeders, the, weight, of, the, testes, often, increases, during, the, breeding, season, the, testicles, of, a, dromedary, camel, are, 7, 10, cm, 2, 8, 3, 9, in, long, 4, 5, cm, 1, 8, in, deep, and, 5, cm, 2, 0, in, in, width, the, right, testicle, is, often, smaller, than, the, left, in, sharks, the, testicle, on, the, right, side, is, usually, larger, in, many, bird, and, mammal, species, the, left, may, be, larger, fish, usually, have, two, testes, of, a, similar, size, the, primitive, jawless, fish, have, only, a, single, testis, located, in, the, midline, of, the, body, although, this, forms, from, the, fusion, of, paired, structures, in, the, embryo, the, basal, condition, for, mammals, is, to, have, internal, testes, the, testes, of, monotremes, xenarthrans, and, afrotherians, remain, within, the, abdomen, testicondy, there, are, also, some, marsupials, with, external, testes, and, boreoeutherian, mammals, with, internal, testes, such, as, the, rhinoceros, cetaceans, such, as, whales, and, dolphins, also, have, internal, testes, as, external, testes, would, increase, drag, in, the, water, they, have, internal, testes, which, are, kept, cool, by, special, circulatory, systems, that, cool, the, arterial, blood, going, to, the, testes, by, placing, the, arteries, near, veins, bringing, cooled, venous, blood, from, the, skin, in, odobenids, and, phocids, the, location, of, the, testes, is, para, abdominal, though, otariids, have, scrotal, testes, boreoeutherian, land, mammals, the, large, group, of, mammals, that, includes, humans, have, externalized, testes, their, testes, function, best, at, temperatures, lower, than, their, core, body, temperature, their, testes, are, located, outside, of, the, body, and, are, suspended, by, the, spermatic, cord, within, the, scrotum, there, are, several, hypotheses, as, to, why, most, boreotherian, mammals, have, external, testes, that, operate, best, at, a, temperature, that, is, slightly, less, than, the, core, body, temperature, one, view, is, that, it, is, stuck, with, enzymes, evolved, in, a, colder, temperature, due, to, external, testes, evolving, for, different, reasons, another, view, is, that, the, lower, temperature, of, the, testes, simply, is, more, efficient, for, sperm, production, the, classic, hypothesis, is, that, cooler, temperature, of, the, testes, allows, for, more, efficient, fertile, spermatogenesis, there, are, no, possible, enzymes, operating, at, normal, core, body, temperature, that, are, as, efficient, as, the, ones, evolved, early, mammals, had, lower, body, temperatures, and, thus, their, testes, worked, efficiently, within, their, body, however, boreotherian, mammals, may, have, higher, body, temperatures, than, the, other, mammals, and, had, to, develop, external, testes, to, keep, them, cool, one, argument, is, that, mammals, with, internal, testes, such, as, the, monotremes, armadillos, sloths, elephants, and, rhinoceroses, have, a, lower, core, body, temperatures, than, those, mammals, with, external, testes, researchers, have, wondered, why, birds, despite, having, very, high, core, body, temperatures, have, internal, testes, and, did, not, evolve, external, testes, it, was, once, theorized, that, birds, used, their, air, sacs, to, cool, the, testes, internally, but, later, studies, revealed, that, birds, testes, are, able, to, function, at, core, body, temperature, some, mammals, with, seasonal, breeding, cycles, keep, their, testes, internal, until, the, breeding, season, after, that, their, testes, descend, and, increase, in, size, and, become, external, the, ancestor, of, the, boreoeutherian, mammals, may, have, been, a, small, mammal, that, required, very, large, testes, for, sperm, competition, and, thus, had, to, place, its, testes, outside, the, body, this, might, have, led, to, enzymes, involved, in, spermatogenesis, spermatogenic, dna, polymerase, beta, and, recombinase, activities, evolving, a, unique, temperature, optimum, that, is, slightly, less, than, core, body, temperature, when, the, boreoeutherian, mammals, diversified, into, forms, that, were, larger, or, did, not, require, intense, sperm, competition, they, still, produced, enzymes, that, operated, best, at, cooler, temperatures, and, had, to, keep, their, testes, outside, the, body, this, position, is, made, less, parsimonious, because, the, kangaroo, a, non, boreoeutherian, mammal, has, external, testicles, separately, from, boreotherian, mammals, the, ancestors, of, kangaroos, might, have, also, been, subject, to, heavy, sperm, competition, and, thus, developed, external, testes, however, kangaroo, external, testes, are, suggestive, of, a, possible, adaptive, function, for, external, testes, in, large, animals, one, argument, for, the, evolution, of, external, testes, is, that, it, protects, the, testes, from, abdominal, cavity, pressure, changes, caused, by, jumping, and, galloping, mild, transient, scrotal, heat, stress, causes, dna, damage, reduced, fertility, and, abnormal, embryonic, development, in, mice, dna, strand, breaks, were, found, in, spermatocytes, recovered, from, testicles, subjected, to, 40, c, or, 42, c, for, 30, minutes, these, findings, suggest, that, the, external, location, of, the, testicles, provides, the, adaptive, benefit, of, protecting, spermatogenic, cells, from, heat, induced, dna, damage, that, could, otherwise, lead, to, infertility, and, germline, mutation, the, relative, size, of, the, testes, is, often, influenced, by, mating, systems, testicular, size, as, a, proportion, of, body, weight, varies, widely, in, the, mammalian, kingdom, there, is, a, tendency, for, testicular, size, to, correspond, with, multiple, mates, e, g, harems, polygamy, production, of, testicular, output, sperm, and, spermatic, fluid, is, also, larger, in, polygamous, animals, possibly, a, spermatogenic, competition, for, survival, the, testes, of, the, right, whale, are, likely, to, be, the, largest, of, any, animal, each, weighing, around, 500, kg, 1, 100, lb, among, the, hominidae, gorillas, have, little, female, promiscuity, and, sperm, competition, and, the, testes, are, small, compared, to, body, weight, 0, 03, chimpanzees, have, high, promiscuity, and, large, testes, compared, to, body, weight, 0, 3, human, testicular, size, falls, between, these, extremes, 0, 08, testis, weight, also, varies, in, seasonal, breeders, like, red, foxes, golden, jackals, and, coyotes, amphibians, and, most, fish, do, not, possess, seminiferous, tubules, instead, the, sperm, are, produced, in, spherical, structures, called, sperm, ampullae, these, are, seasonal, structures, releasing, their, contents, during, the, breeding, season, and, then, being, reabsorbed, by, the, body, before, the, next, breeding, season, new, sperm, ampullae, begin, to, form, and, ripen, the, ampullae, are, otherwise, essentially, identical, to, the, seminiferous, tubules, in, higher, vertebrates, including, the, same, range, of, cell, types
