storks, are, large, long, legged, long, necked, wading, birds, with, long, stout, bills, they, belong, to, the, family, ciconiidae, and, make, up, the, order, ciconiiformes, s, k, o, n, i, f, r, m, i, z, ciconiiformes, previously, included, a, number, of, other, families, such, as, herons, and, ibises, but, those, families, have, been, moved, to, other, orders, storks, dwell, in, many, regions, and, tend, to, live, in, drier, habitats, than, the, closely, related, herons, spoonbills, and, ibises, they, also, lack, the, powder, down, that, those, groups, use, to, clean, off, fish, slime, bill, clattering, is, an, important, mode, of, communication, at, the, nest, many, species, are, migratory, most, storks, eat, frogs, fish, insects, earthworms, small, birds, and, small, mammals, there, are, 20, living, species, of, storks, in, six, genera, various, terms, are, used, to, refer, to, groups, of, storks, two, frequently, used, ones, being, a, muster, of, storks, and, a, phalanx, of, storks, storks, tend, to, use, soaring, gliding, flight, which, conserves, energy, soaring, requires, thermal, air, currents, ottomar, ansch, tz, s, famous, 1884, album, of, photographs, of, storks, inspired, the, design, of, otto, lilienthal, s, experimental, gliders, of, the, late, nineteenth, century, storks, are, heavy, with, wide, wingspans, the, marabou, stork, with, a, wingspan, of, 3, 2, m, 10, ft, 6, in, and, weight, up, to, 8, kg, 18, lb, joins, the, andean, condor, in, having, the, widest, wingspan, of, all, living, land, birds, their, nests, are, often, very, large, and, may, be, used, for, many, years, some, nests, have, been, known, to, grow, to, over, 2, metres, 6, ft, 7, in, in, diameter, and, about, 3, metres, 9, 8, ft, in, depth, all, storks, were, once, thought, to, be, monogamous, but, this, is, only, partially, true, some, species, may, change, mates, after, migrations, and, may, migrate, without, a, mate, storks, large, size, serial, monogamy, and, faithfulness, to, an, established, nesting, site, contribute, to, their, prominence, in, mythology, and, culture, all, 20, stork, species, have, been, assessed, by, the, iucn, and, carry, a, confident, red, list, status, however, the, assessment, for, several, species, were, based, on, incorrect, assumptions, and, a, general, absence, of, sound, information, on, stork, habits, the, word, stork, was, first, used, in, its, current, sense, by, at, least, the, 12th, century, in, middle, english, it, is, derived, from, the, old, english, word, storc, which, itself, comes, from, the, hypothesised, proto, germanic, stork, and, ultimately, the, proto, indo, european, sr, os, the, name, refers, to, the, rigid, posture, of, storks, a, meaning, reflected, in, the, related, word, stark, which, is, derived, from, the, old, english, stearc, several, species, of, storks, are, known, by, other, common, names, the, jabiru, is, named, after, the, tup, guarani, words, meaning, that, which, has, and, swollen, referring, to, its, thickset, neck, the, marabou, stork, is, named, after, the, arabic, word, for, holy, man, mur, bi, due, to, the, perceived, holy, nature, of, the, species, the, adjutants, are, named, after, the, military, rank, referring, to, their, stiff, military, like, gait, a, dna, study, found, that, the, families, ardeidae, balaenicipitidae, scopidae, and, the, threskiornithidae, belong, to, the, pelecaniformes, this, would, make, ciconiidae, the, only, group, storks, were, distinct, and, possibly, widespread, by, the, oligocene, like, most, families, of, aquatic, birds, storks, seem, to, have, arisen, in, the, palaeogene, maybe, 40, 50, million, years, ago, mya, for, the, fossil, record, of, living, genera, documented, since, the, middle, miocene, about, 15, mya, at, least, in, some, cases, see, the, genus, articles, no, species, or, subspecies, of, stork, is, known, to, have, gone, extinct, in, historic, times, a, systematic, literature, review, uncovered, nearly, 1, 000, papers, on, storks, but, showed, most, stork, species, to, lack, scientific, understanding, suggesting, that, many, species, should, be, classified, as, data, deficient, on, the, iucn, red, list, a, ciconia, bone, found, in, a, rock, shelter, on, the, island, of, r, union, was, probably, of, a, bird, taken, there, as, food, by, early, settlers, no, known, account, mentions, the, presence, of, storks, on, the, mascarene, islands, the, following, phylogeny, is, recognized, by, the, international, ornithological, congress, partially, based, on, de, sousa,

ciconiiform, fossil, fragment, from, the, touro, passo, formation, found, at, arroio, touro, passo, rio, grande, do, sul, brazil, might, be, of, the, living, wood, stork, m, americana, it, is, at, most, of, late, pleistocene, age, a, few, 10, 000s, of, years, storks, range, in, size, from, the, marabou, which, stands, 152, cm, 60, in, tall, and, can, weigh, 8, 9, kg, 19, 1, 2, lb, to, the, abdim, s, stork, which, is, only, 75, cm, 30, in, high, and, weighs, only, 1, 3, kg, 2, 3, 4, lb, their, shape, is, superficially, similar, to, the, herons, with, long, legs, and, necks, but, they, are, more, heavy, set, there, is, some, sexual, dimorphism, differences, between, males, and, females, in, size, with, males, being, up, to, 15, bigger, than, females, in, some, species, for, example, the, saddle, billed, stork, but, almost, no, difference, in, appearance, the, only, difference, is, in, the, colour, of, the, iris, of, the, two, species, in, the, genus, ephippiorhynchus, the, bills, of, storks, are, large, to, very, large, and, vary, considerably, between, the, genera, the, shape, of, the, bills, is, linked, to, the, diet, of, the, different, species, the, large, bills, of, the, ciconia, storks, are, the, least, specialized, larger, are, the, massive, and, slightly, upturned, bills, of, the, ephippiorhynchus, and, the, jabiru, these, have, evolved, to, hunt, for, fish, in, shallow, water, larger, still, are, the, massive, daggers, of, the, two, adjutants, and, marabou, leptoptilos, which, are, used, to, feed, on, carrion, and, in, defense, against, other, scavengers, as, well, as, for, taking, other, prey, the, long, ibis, like, downcurved, bills, of, the, mycteria, storks, have, sensitive, tips, that, allow, them, to, detect, prey, by, touch, tactilocation, where, cloudy, conditions, would, not, allow, them, to, see, it, the, most, specialised, bills, of, any, storks, are, those, of, the, two, openbills, anastomus, which, as, their, name, suggests, is, open, in, the, middle, when, their, bill, is, closed, these, bills, have, evolved, to, help, openbills, feed, on, their, primary, prey, item, aquatic, snails, although, it, is, sometimes, reported, that, storks, lack, syrinxes, and, are, mute, they, do, have, syrinxes, and, are, capable, of, making, some, sounds, although, they, do, not, do, so, often, the, syrinxes, of, storks, are, variably, degenerate, however, and, the, syringeal, membranes, of, some, species, are, found, between, tracheal, rings, or, cartilage, an, unusual, arrangement, shared, with, the, ovenbirds, storks, have, a, nearly, cosmopolitan, distribution, being, absent, from, the, poles, most, of, north, america, and, large, parts, of, australia, the, centres, of, stork, diversity, are, in, tropical, asia, and, sub, saharan, africa, with, eight, and, six, breeding, species, respectively, just, three, species, are, present, in, the, new, world, wood, stork, maguari, stork, and, jabiru, which, is, the, tallest, flying, bird, of, the, americas, two, species, white, and, black, stork, reach, europe, and, western, temperate, asia, while, one, species, oriental, stork, reaches, temperate, areas, of, eastern, asia, and, one, species, black, necked, stork, is, found, in, australasia, storks, are, more, diverse, and, common, in, the, tropics, and, the, species, that, live, in, temperate, climates, for, the, most, part, migrate, to, avoid, the, worst, of, winter, they, are, fairly, diverse, in, their, habitat, requirements, some, species, particularly, the, mycteria, wood, storks, and, anastomus, openbills, are, highly, dependent, on, water, and, aquatic, prey, but, many, other, species, are, far, less, dependent, on, this, habitat, type, although, they, will, frequently, make, use, of, it, species, like, the, marabou, and, abdim, s, stork, will, frequently, be, found, foraging, in, open, grasslands, of, savannah, preferred, habitats, include, flooded, grasslands, light, woodland, marshes, and, paddyfields, wet, meadows, river, backwaters, and, ponds, many, species, will, select, shallow, pools, particularly, when, lakes, or, rivers, are, drying, out, as, they, concentrate, prey, and, make, it, harder, for, prey, to, escape, or, when, monsoonal, rainfall, increases, water, depth, of, larger, waterbodies, some, species, like, the, woolly, necked, storks, and, lesser, adjutant, storks, have, adapted, to, changing, crops, of, tropical, agricultural, landscapes, that, enables, them, to, remain, resident, despite, the, transformations, brought, about, by, seasonal, crops, in, south, africa, the, woolly, necked, storks, have, adapted, to, artificial, feeding, and, now, largely, nest, on, trees, in, gardens, with, swimming, pools, less, typical, habitats, include, the, dense, temperate, forests, used, by, european, black, storks, or, the, rainforest, habitat, sought, by, storm, s, stork, in, south, east, asia, they, generally, avoid, marine, habitats, with, the, exception, of, the, lesser, adjutant, milky, stork, and, wood, stork, all, of, which, forage, in, mangroves, lagoons, and, estuarine, mudflats, a, number, of, species, especially, woolly, necked, storks, black, necked, storks, asian, openbills, and, lesser, adjutant, storks, in, south, asia, have, adapted, to, highly, modified, human, habitats, for, foraging, and, breeding, in, the, absence, of, persecution, several, stork, species, breed, close, to, people, and, species, such, as, the, marabou, greater, adjutant, and, white, stork, feed, at, landfill, sites, storks, vary, in, their, tendency, towards, migration, temperate, species, like, the, white, stork, black, stork, and, oriental, stork, undertake, long, annual, migrations, in, the, winter, the, routes, taken, by, these, species, have, developed, to, avoid, long, distance, travel, across, water, and, from, europe, this, usually, means, flying, across, the, straits, of, gibraltar, or, east, across, the, bosphorus, and, through, israel, and, the, sinai, studies, of, young, birds, denied, the, chance, to, travel, with, others, of, their, species, have, shown, that, these, routes, are, at, least, partially, learnt, rather, than, being, innate, as, they, are, in, passerine, migrants, migrating, black, storks, are, split, between, those, that, make, stopovers, on, the, migration, between, europe, and, their, wintering, grounds, in, africa, and, those, that, do, not, the, abdim, s, stork, is, another, migrant, albeit, one, that, migrates, within, the, tropics, it, breeds, in, northern, africa, from, senegal, to, the, red, sea, during, the, wet, season, and, then, migrates, to, southern, africa, many, species, that, are, not, regular, migrants, will, still, make, smaller, movements, if, circumstances, require, it, others, may, migrate, over, part, of, their, range, this, can, also, include, regular, commutes, from, nesting, sites, to, feeding, areas, wood, storks, have, been, observed, feeding, 130, km, 80, mi, from, their, breeding, colony, storks, are, carnivorous, predators, taking, a, range, of, reptiles, small, mammals, insects, fish, amphibians, and, other, small, invertebrates, storks, usually, hunt, for, animals, in, shallow, water, any, plant, material, consumed, is, usually, by, accident, mycteria, storks, are, specialists, in, feeding, on, aquatic, vertebrates, particularly, when, prey, is, concentrated, by, lowering, water, levels, or, flooding, into, shallows, on, marine, mudflats, and, mangrove, swamps, in, sumatra, milky, storks, feed, on, mudskippers, probing, the, burrow, with, the, bill, and, even, the, whole, head, into, the, mud, the, characteristic, feeding, method, involves, standing, or, walking, in, shallow, water, and, holding, the, bill, submerged, in, the, water, when, contact, is, made, with, prey, the, bill, reflexively, snaps, shut, in, 25, milliseconds, one, of, the, fastest, reactions, known, in, any, vertebrate, the, reaction, is, able, to, distinguish, between, prey, items, and, inanimate, objects, like, branches, although, the, exact, mechanism, is, unknown, openbills, are, specialists, in, freshwater, molluscs, particularly, apple, snails, they, feed, in, small, groups, and, sometimes, african, openbills, ride, on, the, backs, of, hippos, while, foraging, having, caught, a, snail, it, will, return, to, land, or, at, least, to, the, shallows, to, eat, it, the, fine, tip, of, the, bill, of, the, openbills, is, used, to, open, the, snail, and, the, saliva, has, a, narcotic, effect, which, causes, the, snail, to, relax, and, simplifies, the, process, of, extraction, the, other, genera, of, storks, are, more, generalised, ciconia, storks, are, very, generalised, in, their, diets, and, some, species, including, abdim, s, stork, and, marabous, will, feed, in, large, flocks, on, swarms, of, locusts, and, at, wildfires, this, is, why, white, storks, and, abdim, s, storks, are, known, as, grasshopper, birds, ephippiorhynchus, are, carnivorous, though, have, a, very, diverse, diet, when, living, on, human, modified, habitats, such, as, agricultural, landscapes, the, foraging, method, used, by, the, generalists, is, to, stalk, or, walk, across, grassland, or, shallow, water, watching, for, prey, storks, range, from, being, solitary, breeders, through, loose, breeding, associations, to, fully, colonial, the, jabiru, ephippiorhynchus, storks, and, several, species, of, ciconia, are, entirely, solitary, when, breeding, in, contrast, the, mycteria, storks, abdim, s, stork, openbills, and, leptoptilos, storks, breed, in, colonies, which, can, range, from, a, couple, of, pairs, to, thousands, many, of, these, species, breed, in, colonies, with, other, waterbirds, which, can, include, other, species, of, storks, herons, and, egrets, pelicans, cormorants, and, ibises, white, storks, oriental, storks, and, maguari, storks, are, all, loosely, colonial, and, may, breed, in, nests, that, are, within, visual, range, of, others, of, the, same, species, but, have, little, to, do, with, one, another, they, also, may, nest, solitarily, and, the, reasons, why, they, choose, to, nest, together, or, apart, are, not, understood, storks, use, trees, in, a, variety, of, habitats, to, breed, including, forests, cities, farmlands, and, large, wetlands, many, ancient, mythologies, feature, stories, and, legends, involving, storks, in, ancient, egypt, saddle, billed, storks, were, seen, as, being, amongst, the, most, powerful, animals, and, were, used, to, represent, the, ba, the, ancient, egyptian, conception, of, the, soul, during, the, old, kingdom, bennu, an, egyptian, deity, that, was, later, the, inspiration, for, the, phoenix, may, also, have, been, inspired, by, a, stork, although, it, was, more, likely, an, ibis, or, heron, greek, and, roman, mythology, portrays, storks, as, models, of, parental, devotion, the, 3rd, century, roman, writer, aelian, citing, the, authority, of, alexander, of, myndus, noted, in, his, de, natura, animalium, book, 3, chapter, 23, that, aged, storks, flew, away, to, oceanic, islands, where, they, were, transformed, into, humans, as, a, reward, for, their, piety, towards, their, parents, storks, were, also, thought, to, care, for, their, aged, parents, feeding, them, and, even, transporting, them, and, children, s, books, depicted, them, as, a, model, of, filial, values, a, greek, law, called, pelargonia, from, the, ancient, greek, word, pelargos, for, stork, required, citizens, to, take, care, of, their, aged, parents, the, greeks, also, held, that, killing, a, stork, could, be, punished, with, death, storks, feature, in, several, of, aesop, s, fables, most, notably, in, the, farmer, and, the, stork, the, fox, and, the, stork, and, the, frogs, who, desired, a, king, the, first, fable, involves, a, stork, who, is, caught, with, a, group, of, cranes, who, are, eating, grain, in, a, farmer, s, field, with, the, moral, that, those, who, associate, with, wicked, people, can, be, held, accountable, for, their, crimes, the, fox, and, the, stork, involves, a, fox, who, invites, a, stork, for, dinner, and, provides, soup, in, a, dish, that, the, stork, cannot, drink, from, and, is, in, turn, invited, for, dinner, by, the, stork, and, given, food, in, a, narrow, jug, which, he, cannot, access, it, cautions, readers, to, follow, the, principle, of, do, no, harm, the, third, fable, involves, a, group, of, frogs, that, are, dissatisfied, with, the, king, that, zeus, has, given, them, an, inanimate, log, and, who, are, then, punished, with, a, new, king, stork, a, water, snake, in, some, versions, who, eats, the, frogs, king, stork, has, subsequently, entered, the, english, language, as, a, term, for, a, particularly, tyrannical, ruler, according, to, european, folklore, the, white, stork, is, responsible, for, bringing, babies, to, new, parents, the, legend, is, very, ancient, but, was, popularised, by, a, 19th, century, hans, christian, andersen, story, called, the, storks, german, folklore, held, that, storks, found, babies, in, caves, or, marshes, and, brought, them, to, households, in, a, basket, on, their, backs, or, held, in, their, beaks, these, caves, contained, adebarsteine, or, stork, stones, the, babies, would, then, be, given, to, the, mother, or, dropped, down, the, chimney, households, would, notify, when, they, wanted, children, by, placing, sweets, for, the, stork, on, the, window, sill, subsequently, the, folklore, has, spread, around, the, world, to, the, philippines, and, countries, in, south, america, birthmarks, on, the, back, of, the, head, of, newborn, babies, nevus, flammeus, nuchae, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, stork, bite, in, slavic, mythology, and, pagan, religion, storks, were, thought, to, carry, unborn, souls, from, vyraj, to, earth, in, spring, and, summer, this, belief, still, persists, in, the, modern, folk, culture, of, many, slavic, countries, in, the, simplified, child, story, that, storks, bring, children, into, the, world, psychoanalyst, marvin, margolis, suggests, the, enduring, nature, of, the, stork, fable, of, the, newborn, is, linked, to, its, addressing, a, psychological, need, in, that, it, allays, the, discomfort, of, discussing, sex, and, procreation, with, children, birds, have, long, been, associated, with, the, maternal, symbols, from, pagan, goddesses, such, as, juno, to, the, holy, ghost, and, the, stork, may, have, been, chosen, for, its, white, plumage, depicting, purity, size, and, flight, at, high, altitude, likened, to, flying, between, earth, and, heaven, there, were, negative, aspects, to, stork, folklore, as, well, a, polish, folk, tale, relates, how, god, made, the, stork, s, plumage, white, while, the, devil, gave, it, black, wings, imbuing, it, with, both, good, and, evil, impulses, they, were, also, associated, with, handicapped, or, stillborn, babies, in, germany, explained, as, the, stork, having, dropped, the, baby, en, route, to, the, household, or, as, revenge, or, punishment, for, past, wrongdoing, a, mother, who, was, confined, to, bed, around, the, time, of, childbirth, was, said, to, have, been, bitten, by, the, stork, in, denmark, storks, were, said, to, toss, a, nestling, off, the, nest, and, then, an, egg, in, successive, years, in, medieval, england, storks, were, also, associated, with, adultery, possibly, inspired, by, their, courtship, rituals, their, preening, and, posture, saw, them, linked, with, the, attribute, of, self, conceit, children, of, african, american, slaves, were, sometimes, told, that, white, babies, were, brought, by, storks, while, black, babies, were, born, from, buzzard, eggs, storks, have, never, been, a, particularly, common, food, but, occasionally, featured, in, medieval, banquets, they, may, also, have, been, eaten, in, ancient, egypt
