blood, is, a, body, fluid, in, the, circulatory, system, of, humans, and, other, vertebrates, that, delivers, necessary, substances, such, as, nutrients, and, oxygen, to, the, cells, and, transports, metabolic, waste, products, away, from, those, same, cells, blood, is, composed, of, blood, cells, suspended, in, blood, plasma, plasma, which, constitutes, 55, of, blood, fluid, is, mostly, water, 92, by, volume, and, contains, proteins, glucose, mineral, ions, and, hormones, the, blood, cells, are, mainly, red, blood, cells, erythrocytes, white, blood, cells, leukocytes, and, in, mammals, platelets, thrombocytes, the, most, abundant, cells, are, red, blood, cells, these, contain, hemoglobin, which, facilitates, oxygen, transport, by, reversibly, binding, to, it, increasing, its, solubility, jawed, vertebrates, have, an, adaptive, immune, system, based, largely, on, white, blood, cells, white, blood, cells, help, to, resist, infections, and, parasites, platelets, are, important, in, the, clotting, of, blood, blood, is, circulated, around, the, body, through, blood, vessels, by, the, pumping, action, of, the, heart, in, animals, with, lungs, arterial, blood, carries, oxygen, from, inhaled, air, to, the, tissues, of, the, body, and, venous, blood, carries, carbon, dioxide, a, waste, product, of, metabolism, produced, by, cells, from, the, tissues, to, the, lungs, to, be, exhaled, blood, is, bright, red, when, its, hemoglobin, is, oxygenated, and, dark, red, when, it, is, deoxygenated, medical, terms, related, to, blood, often, begin, with, hemo, hemato, haemo, or, haemato, from, the, greek, word, haima, for, blood, in, terms, of, anatomy, and, histology, blood, is, considered, a, specialized, form, of, connective, tissue, given, its, origin, in, the, bones, and, the, presence, of, potential, molecular, fibers, in, the, form, of, fibrinogen, blood, performs, many, important, functions, within, the, body, including, blood, accounts, for, 7, of, the, human, body, weight, with, an, average, density, around, 1060, kg, m, 3, very, close, to, pure, water, s, density, of, 1000, kg, m, 3, the, average, adult, has, a, blood, volume, of, roughly, 5, litres, 11, us, pt, or, 1, 3, gallons, which, is, composed, of, plasma, and, formed, elements, the, formed, elements, are, the, two, types, of, blood, cell, or, corpuscle, the, red, blood, cells, erythrocytes, and, white, blood, cells, leukocytes, and, the, cell, fragments, called, platelets, that, are, involved, in, clotting, by, volume, the, red, blood, cells, constitute, about, 45, of, whole, blood, the, plasma, about, 54, 3, and, white, cells, about, 0, 7, whole, blood, plasma, and, cells, exhibits, non, newtonian, fluid, dynamics, one, microliter, of, blood, contains, 45, 7, 38, 52, for, males, 42, 5, 37, 47, for, females, oxygenated, 98, 99, deoxygenated, 75, about, 55, of, blood, is, blood, plasma, a, fluid, that, is, the, blood, s, liquid, medium, which, by, itself, is, straw, yellow, in, color, the, blood, plasma, volume, totals, of, 2, 7, 3, 0, liters, 2, 8, 3, 2, quarts, in, an, average, human, it, is, essentially, an, aqueous, solution, containing, 92, water, 8, blood, plasma, proteins, and, trace, amounts, of, other, materials, plasma, circulates, dissolved, nutrients, such, as, glucose, amino, acids, and, fatty, acids, dissolved, in, the, blood, or, bound, to, plasma, proteins, and, removes, waste, products, such, as, carbon, dioxide, urea, and, lactic, acid, other, important, components, include, the, term, serum, refers, to, plasma, from, which, the, clotting, proteins, have, been, removed, most, of, the, proteins, remaining, are, albumin, and, immunoglobulins, blood, ph, is, regulated, to, stay, within, the, narrow, range, of, 7, 35, to, 7, 45, making, it, slightly, basic, compensation, extra, cellular, fluid, in, blood, that, has, a, ph, below, 7, 35, is, too, acidic, whereas, blood, ph, above, 7, 45, is, too, basic, a, ph, below, 6, 9, or, above, 7, 8, is, usually, lethal, blood, ph, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, po, 2, partial, pressure, of, carbon, dioxide, pco, 2, and, bicarbonate, hco, 3, are, carefully, regulated, by, a, number, of, homeostatic, mechanisms, which, exert, their, influence, principally, through, the, respiratory, system, and, the, urinary, system, to, control, the, acid, base, balance, and, respiration, which, is, called, compensation, an, arterial, blood, gas, test, measures, these, plasma, also, circulates, hormones, transmitting, their, messages, to, various, tissues, the, list, of, normal, reference, ranges, for, various, blood, electrolytes, is, extensive, human, blood, is, typical, of, that, of, mammals, although, the, precise, details, concerning, cell, numbers, size, protein, structure, and, so, on, vary, somewhat, between, species, in, non, mammalian, vertebrates, however, there, are, some, key, differences, blood, is, circulated, around, the, body, through, blood, vessels, by, the, pumping, action, of, the, heart, in, humans, blood, is, pumped, from, the, strong, left, ventricle, of, the, heart, through, arteries, to, peripheral, tissues, and, returns, to, the, right, atrium, of, the, heart, through, veins, it, then, enters, the, right, ventricle, and, is, pumped, through, the, pulmonary, artery, to, the, lungs, and, returns, to, the, left, atrium, through, the, pulmonary, veins, blood, then, enters, the, left, ventricle, to, be, circulated, again, arterial, blood, carries, oxygen, from, inhaled, air, to, all, of, the, cells, of, the, body, and, venous, blood, carries, carbon, dioxide, a, waste, product, of, metabolism, by, cells, to, the, lungs, to, be, exhaled, however, one, exception, includes, pulmonary, arteries, which, contain, the, most, deoxygenated, blood, in, the, body, while, the, pulmonary, veins, contain, oxygenated, blood, additional, return, flow, may, be, generated, by, the, movement, of, skeletal, muscles, which, can, compress, veins, and, push, blood, through, the, valves, in, veins, toward, the, right, atrium, the, blood, circulation, was, famously, described, by, william, harvey, in, 1628, in, vertebrates, the, various, cells, of, blood, are, made, in, the, bone, marrow, in, a, process, called, hematopoiesis, which, includes, erythropoiesis, the, production, of, red, blood, cells, and, myelopoiesis, the, production, of, white, blood, cells, and, platelets, during, childhood, almost, every, human, bone, produces, red, blood, cells, as, adults, red, blood, cell, production, is, limited, to, the, larger, bones, the, bodies, of, the, vertebrae, the, breastbone, sternum, the, ribcage, the, pelvic, bones, and, the, bones, of, the, upper, arms, and, legs, in, addition, during, childhood, the, thymus, gland, found, in, the, mediastinum, is, an, important, source, of, t, lymphocytes, the, proteinaceous, component, of, blood, including, clotting, proteins, is, produced, predominantly, by, the, liver, while, hormones, are, produced, by, the, endocrine, glands, and, the, watery, fraction, is, regulated, by, the, hypothalamus, and, maintained, by, the, kidney, healthy, erythrocytes, have, a, plasma, life, of, about, 120, days, before, they, are, degraded, by, the, spleen, and, the, kupffer, cells, in, the, liver, the, liver, also, clears, some, proteins, lipids, and, amino, acids, the, kidney, actively, secretes, waste, products, into, the, urine, about, 98, 5, of, the, oxygen, in, a, sample, of, arterial, blood, in, a, healthy, human, breathing, air, at, sea, level, pressure, is, chemically, combined, with, the, hemoglobin, about, 1, 5, is, physically, dissolved, in, the, other, blood, liquids, and, not, connected, to, hemoglobin, the, hemoglobin, molecule, is, the, primary, transporter, of, oxygen, in, mammals, and, many, other, species, hemoglobin, has, an, oxygen, binding, capacity, between, 1, 36, and, 1, 40, ml, o, 2, per, gram, hemoglobin, which, increases, the, total, blood, oxygen, capacity, seventyfold, compared, to, if, oxygen, solely, were, carried, by, its, solubility, of, 0, 03, ml, o, 2, per, liter, blood, per, mm, hg, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, about, 100, mm, hg, in, arteries, with, the, exception, of, pulmonary, and, umbilical, arteries, and, their, corresponding, veins, arteries, carry, oxygenated, blood, away, from, the, heart, and, deliver, it, to, the, body, via, arterioles, and, capillaries, where, the, oxygen, is, consumed, afterwards, venules, and, veins, carry, deoxygenated, blood, back, to, the, heart, under, normal, conditions, in, adult, humans, at, rest, hemoglobin, in, blood, leaving, the, lungs, is, about, 98, 99, saturated, with, oxygen, achieving, an, oxygen, delivery, between, 950, and, 1150, ml, min, to, the, body, in, a, healthy, adult, at, rest, oxygen, consumption, is, approximately, 200, 250, ml, min, and, deoxygenated, blood, returning, to, the, lungs, is, still, roughly, 75, 70, to, 78, saturated, increased, oxygen, consumption, during, sustained, exercise, reduces, the, oxygen, saturation, of, venous, blood, which, can, reach, less, than, 15, in, a, trained, athlete, although, breathing, rate, and, blood, flow, increase, to, compensate, oxygen, saturation, in, arterial, blood, can, drop, to, 95, or, less, under, these, conditions, oxygen, saturation, this, low, is, considered, dangerous, in, an, individual, at, rest, for, instance, during, surgery, under, anesthesia, sustained, hypoxia, oxygenation, less, than, 90, is, dangerous, to, health, and, severe, hypoxia, saturations, less, than, 30, may, be, rapidly, fatal, a, fetus, receiving, oxygen, via, the, placenta, is, exposed, to, much, lower, oxygen, pressures, about, 21, of, the, level, found, in, an, adult, s, lungs, so, fetuses, produce, another, form, of, hemoglobin, with, a, much, higher, affinity, for, oxygen, hemoglobin, f, to, function, under, these, conditions, co, 2, is, carried, in, blood, in, three, different, ways, the, exact, percentages, vary, depending, whether, it, is, arterial, or, venous, blood, most, of, it, about, 70, is, converted, to, bicarbonate, ions, hco, 3, by, the, enzyme, carbonic, anhydrase, in, the, red, blood, cells, by, the, reaction, co, 2, h, 2, o, h, 2, co, 3, h, hco, 3, about, 7, is, dissolved, in, the, plasma, and, about, 23, is, bound, to, hemoglobin, as, carbamino, compounds, hemoglobin, the, main, oxygen, carrying, molecule, in, red, blood, cells, carries, both, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, however, the, co, 2, bound, to, hemoglobin, does, not, bind, to, the, same, site, as, oxygen, instead, it, combines, with, the, n, terminal, groups, on, the, four, globin, chains, however, because, of, allosteric, effects, on, the, hemoglobin, molecule, the, binding, of, co, 2, decreases, the, amount, of, oxygen, that, is, bound, for, a, given, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, the, decreased, binding, to, carbon, dioxide, in, the, blood, due, to, increased, oxygen, levels, is, known, as, the, haldane, effect, and, is, important, in, the, transport, of, carbon, dioxide, from, the, tissues, to, the, lungs, a, rise, in, the, partial, pressure, of, co, 2, or, a, lower, ph, will, cause, offloading, of, oxygen, from, hemoglobin, which, is, known, as, the, bohr, effect, some, oxyhemoglobin, loses, oxygen, and, becomes, deoxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, binds, most, of, the, hydrogen, ions, as, it, has, a, much, greater, affinity, for, more, hydrogen, than, does, oxyhemoglobin, in, mammals, blood, is, in, equilibrium, with, lymph, which, is, continuously, formed, in, tissues, from, blood, by, capillary, ultrafiltration, lymph, is, collected, by, a, system, of, small, lymphatic, vessels, and, directed, to, the, thoracic, duct, which, drains, into, the, left, subclavian, vein, where, lymph, rejoins, the, systemic, blood, circulation, blood, circulation, transports, heat, throughout, the, body, and, adjustments, to, this, flow, are, an, important, part, of, thermoregulation, increasing, blood, flow, to, the, surface, e, g, during, warm, weather, or, strenuous, exercise, causes, warmer, skin, resulting, in, faster, heat, loss, in, contrast, when, the, external, temperature, is, low, blood, flow, to, the, extremities, and, surface, of, the, skin, is, reduced, and, to, prevent, heat, loss, and, is, circulated, to, the, important, organs, of, the, body, preferentially, rate, of, blood, flow, varies, greatly, between, different, organs, liver, has, the, most, abundant, blood, supply, with, an, approximate, flow, of, 1350, ml, min, kidney, and, brain, are, the, second, and, the, third, most, supplied, organs, with, 1100, ml, min, and, 700, ml, min, respectively, relative, rates, of, blood, flow, per, 100, g, of, tissue, are, different, with, kidney, adrenal, gland, and, thyroid, being, the, first, second, and, third, most, supplied, tissues, respectively, the, restriction, of, blood, flow, can, also, be, used, in, specialized, tissues, to, cause, engorgement, resulting, in, an, erection, of, that, tissue, examples, are, the, erectile, tissue, in, the, penis, and, clitoris, another, example, of, a, hydraulic, function, is, the, jumping, spider, in, which, blood, forced, into, the, legs, under, pressure, causes, them, to, straighten, for, a, powerful, jump, without, the, need, for, bulky, muscular, legs, hemoglobin, is, the, principal, determinant, of, the, color, of, blood, hemochrome, each, molecule, has, four, heme, groups, and, their, interaction, with, various, molecules, alters, the, exact, color, arterial, blood, and, capillary, blood, are, bright, red, as, oxygen, imparts, a, strong, red, color, to, the, heme, group, deoxygenated, blood, is, a, darker, shade, of, red, this, is, present, in, veins, and, can, be, seen, during, blood, donation, and, when, venous, blood, samples, are, taken, this, is, because, the, spectrum, of, light, absorbed, by, hemoglobin, differs, between, the, oxygenated, and, deoxygenated, states, blood, in, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, is, bright, red, because, carbon, monoxide, causes, the, formation, of, carboxyhemoglobin, in, cyanide, poisoning, the, body, cannot, use, oxygen, so, the, venous, blood, remains, oxygenated, increasing, the, redness, there, are, some, conditions, affecting, the, heme, groups, present, in, hemoglobin, that, can, make, the, skin, appear, blue, a, symptom, called, cyanosis, if, the, heme, is, oxidized, methemoglobin, which, is, more, brownish, and, cannot, transport, oxygen, is, formed, in, the, rare, condition, sulfhemoglobinemia, arterial, hemoglobin, is, partially, oxygenated, and, appears, dark, red, with, a, bluish, hue, veins, close, to, the, surface, of, the, skin, appear, blue, for, a, variety, of, reasons, however, the, factors, that, contribute, to, this, alteration, of, color, perception, are, related, to, the, light, scattering, properties, of, the, skin, and, the, processing, of, visual, input, by, the, visual, cortex, rather, than, the, actual, color, of, the, venous, blood, skinks, in, the, genus, prasinohaema, have, green, blood, due, to, a, buildup, of, the, waste, product, biliverdin, substances, other, than, oxygen, can, bind, to, hemoglobin, in, some, cases, this, can, cause, irreversible, damage, to, the, body, carbon, monoxide, for, example, is, extremely, dangerous, when, carried, to, the, blood, via, the, lungs, by, inhalation, because, carbon, monoxide, irreversibly, binds, to, hemoglobin, to, form, carboxyhemoglobin, so, that, less, hemoglobin, is, free, to, bind, oxygen, and, fewer, oxygen, molecules, can, be, transported, throughout, the, blood, this, can, cause, suffocation, insidiously, a, fire, burning, in, an, enclosed, room, with, poor, ventilation, presents, a, very, dangerous, hazard, since, it, can, create, a, build, up, of, carbon, monoxide, in, the, air, some, carbon, monoxide, binds, to, hemoglobin, when, smoking, tobacco, blood, for, transfusion, is, obtained, from, human, donors, by, blood, donation, and, stored, in, a, blood, bank, there, are, many, different, blood, types, in, humans, the, abo, blood, group, system, and, the, rhesus, blood, group, system, being, the, most, important, transfusion, of, blood, of, an, incompatible, blood, group, may, cause, severe, often, fatal, complications, so, crossmatching, is, done, to, ensure, that, a, compatible, blood, product, is, transfused, other, blood, products, administered, intravenously, are, platelets, blood, plasma, cryoprecipitate, and, specific, coagulation, factor, concentrates, many, forms, of, medication, from, antibiotics, to, chemotherapy, are, administered, intravenously, as, they, are, not, readily, or, adequately, absorbed, by, the, digestive, tract, after, severe, acute, blood, loss, liquid, preparations, generically, known, as, plasma, expanders, can, be, given, intravenously, either, solutions, of, salts, nacl, kcl, cacl, 2, etc, at, physiological, concentrations, or, colloidal, solutions, such, as, dextrans, human, serum, albumin, or, fresh, frozen, plasma, in, these, emergency, situations, a, plasma, expander, is, a, more, effective, life, saving, procedure, than, a, blood, transfusion, because, the, metabolism, of, transfused, red, blood, cells, does, not, restart, immediately, after, a, transfusion, in, modern, evidence, based, medicine, bloodletting, is, used, in, management, of, a, few, rare, diseases, including, hemochromatosis, and, polycythemia, however, bloodletting, and, leeching, were, common, unvalidated, interventions, used, until, the, 19th, century, as, many, diseases, were, incorrectly, thought, to, be, due, to, an, excess, of, blood, according, to, hippocratic, medicine, english, blood, old, english, blod, derives, from, germanic, and, has, cognates, with, a, similar, range, of, meanings, in, all, other, germanic, languages, e, g, german, blut, swedish, blod, gothic, bl, there, is, no, accepted, indo, european, etymology, robin, f, hr, us, a, swedish, physician, who, devised, the, erythrocyte, sedimentation, rate, suggested, that, the, ancient, greek, system, of, humorism, wherein, the, body, was, thought, to, contain, four, distinct, bodily, fluids, associated, with, different, temperaments, were, based, upon, the, observation, of, blood, clotting, in, a, transparent, container, when, blood, is, drawn, in, a, glass, container, and, left, undisturbed, for, about, an, hour, four, different, layers, can, be, seen, a, dark, clot, forms, at, the, bottom, the, black, bile, above, the, clot, is, a, layer, of, red, blood, cells, the, blood, above, this, is, a, whitish, layer, of, white, blood, cells, the, phlegm, the, top, layer, is, clear, yellow, serum, the, yellow, bile, the, abo, blood, group, system, was, discovered, in, the, year, 1900, by, karl, landsteiner, jan, jansk, is, credited, with, the, first, classification, of, blood, into, the, four, types, a, b, ab, and, o, in, 1907, which, remains, in, use, today, in, 1907, the, first, blood, transfusion, was, performed, that, used, the, abo, system, to, predict, compatibility, the, first, non, direct, transfusion, was, performed, on, 27, march, 1914, the, rhesus, factor, was, discovered, in, 1937, due, to, its, importance, to, life, blood, is, associated, with, a, large, number, of, beliefs, one, of, the, most, basic, is, the, use, of, blood, as, a, symbol, for, family, relationships, through, birth, parentage, to, be, related, by, blood, is, to, be, related, by, ancestry, or, descendence, rather, than, marriage, this, bears, closely, to, bloodlines, and, sayings, such, as, blood, is, thicker, than, water, and, bad, blood, as, well, as, blood, brother, blood, is, given, particular, emphasis, in, the, islamic, jewish, and, christian, religions, because, leviticus, 17, 11, says, the, life, of, a, creature, is, in, the, blood, this, phrase, is, part, of, the, levitical, law, forbidding, the, drinking, of, blood, or, eating, meat, with, the, blood, still, intact, instead, of, being, poured, off, mythic, references, to, blood, can, sometimes, be, connected, to, the, life, giving, nature, of, blood, seen, in, such, events, as, childbirth, as, contrasted, with, the, blood, of, injury, or, death, in, many, indigenous, australian, aboriginal, peoples, traditions, ochre, particularly, red, and, blood, both, high, in, iron, content, and, considered, maban, are, applied, to, the, bodies, of, dancers, for, ritual, as, lawlor, states, in, many, aboriginal, rituals, and, ceremonies, red, ochre, is, rubbed, all, over, the, naked, bodies, of, the, dancers, in, secret, sacred, male, ceremonies, blood, extracted, from, the, veins, of, the, participant, s, arms, is, exchanged, and, rubbed, on, their, bodies, red, ochre, is, used, in, similar, ways, in, less, secret, ceremonies, blood, is, also, used, to, fasten, the, feathers, of, birds, onto, people, s, bodies, bird, feathers, contain, a, protein, that, is, highly, magnetically, sensitive, lawlor, comments, that, blood, employed, in, this, fashion, is, held, by, these, peoples, to, attune, the, dancers, to, the, invisible, energetic, realm, of, the, dreamtime, lawlor, then, connects, these, invisible, energetic, realms, and, magnetic, fields, because, iron, is, magnetic, among, the, germanic, tribes, blood, was, used, during, their, sacrifices, the, bl, ts, the, blood, was, considered, to, have, the, power, of, its, originator, and, after, the, butchering, the, blood, was, sprinkled, on, the, walls, on, the, statues, of, the, gods, and, on, the, participants, themselves, this, act, of, sprinkling, blood, was, called, bl, edsian, in, old, english, and, the, terminology, was, borrowed, by, the, roman, catholic, church, becoming, to, bless, and, blessing, the, hittite, word, for, blood, ishar, was, a, cognate, to, words, for, oath, and, bond, see, ishara, the, ancient, greeks, believed, that, the, blood, of, the, gods, ichor, was, a, substance, that, was, poisonous, to, mortals, as, a, relic, of, germanic, law, the, cruentation, an, ordeal, where, the, corpse, of, the, victim, was, supposed, to, start, bleeding, in, the, presence, of, the, murderer, was, used, until, the, early, 17th, century, in, genesis, 9, 4, god, prohibited, noah, and, his, sons, from, eating, blood, see, noahide, law, this, command, continued, to, be, observed, by, the, eastern, orthodox, church, it, is, also, found, in, the, bible, that, when, the, angel, of, death, came, around, to, the, hebrew, house, that, the, first, born, child, would, not, die, if, the, angel, saw, lamb, s, blood, wiped, across, the, doorway, at, the, council, of, jerusalem, the, apostles, prohibited, certain, christians, from, consuming, blood, this, is, documented, in, acts, 15, 20, and, 29, this, chapter, specifies, a, reason, especially, in, verses, 19, 21, it, was, to, avoid, offending, jews, who, had, become, christians, because, the, mosaic, law, code, prohibited, the, practice, christ, s, blood, is, the, means, for, the, atonement, of, sins, also, the, blood, of, jesus, christ, his, son, cleanseth, us, from, all, sin, 1, john, 1, 7, unto, him, that, loved, us, and, washed, us, from, our, sins, in, his, own, blood, revelation, 1, 5, and, and, they, overcame, him, satan, by, the, blood, of, the, lamb, and, by, the, word, of, their, testimony, revelation, 12, 11, some, christian, churches, including, roman, catholicism, eastern, orthodoxy, oriental, orthodoxy, and, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, teach, that, when, consecrated, the, eucharistic, wine, actually, becomes, the, blood, of, jesus, for, worshippers, to, drink, thus, in, the, consecrated, wine, jesus, becomes, spiritually, and, physically, present, this, teaching, is, rooted, in, the, last, supper, as, written, in, the, four, gospels, of, the, bible, in, which, jesus, stated, to, his, disciples, that, the, bread, that, they, ate, was, his, body, and, the, wine, was, his, blood, this, cup, is, the, new, testament, in, my, blood, which, is, shed, for, you, luke, 22, 20, most, forms, of, protestantism, especially, those, of, a, methodist, or, presbyterian, lineage, teach, that, the, wine, is, no, more, than, a, symbol, of, the, blood, of, christ, who, is, spiritually, but, not, physically, present, lutheran, theology, teaches, that, the, body, and, blood, is, present, together, in, with, and, under, the, bread, and, wine, of, the, eucharistic, feast, in, judaism, animal, blood, may, not, be, consumed, even, in, the, smallest, quantity, leviticus, 3, 17, and, elsewhere, this, is, reflected, in, jewish, dietary, laws, kashrut, blood, is, purged, from, meat, by, rinsing, and, soaking, in, water, to, loosen, clots, salting, and, then, rinsing, with, water, again, several, times, eggs, must, also, be, checked, and, any, blood, spots, removed, before, consumption, although, blood, from, fish, is, biblically, kosher, it, is, rabbinically, forbidden, to, consume, fish, blood, to, avoid, the, appearance, of, breaking, the, biblical, prohibition, another, ritual, involving, blood, involves, the, covering, of, the, blood, of, fowl, and, game, after, slaughtering, leviticus, 17, 13, the, reason, given, by, the, torah, is, because, the, life, of, the, animal, is, its, blood, ibid, 17, 14, in, relation, to, human, beings,
