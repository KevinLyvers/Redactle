of, north, america, and, northern, eurasia, all, living, species, of, loons, are, members, of, the, genus, gavia, family, gaviidae, and, order, gaviiformes, loons, which, are, the, size, of, large, ducks, or, small, geese, resemble, these, birds, in, shape, when, swimming, like, ducks, and, geese, but, unlike, coots, which, are, rallidae, and, grebes, podicipedidae, the, loon, s, toes, are, connected, by, webbing, the, loons, may, be, confused, with, the, cormorants, phalacrocoracidae, but, can, be, distinguished, from, them, by, their, distinct, call, cormorants, are, not, too, distant, relatives, of, loons, and, like, them, are, heavy, set, birds, whose, bellies, unlike, those, of, ducks, and, geese, are, submerged, when, swimming, loons, in, flight, resemble, plump, geese, with, seagulls, wings, that, are, relatively, small, in, proportion, to, their, bulky, bodies, the, bird, points, its, head, slightly, upwards, while, swimming, but, less, so, than, cormorants, in, flight, the, head, droops, more, than, in, similar, aquatic, birds, male, and, female, loons, have, identical, plumage, which, is, largely, patterned, black, and, white, in, summer, with, grey, on, the, head, and, neck, in, some, species, all, have, a, white, belly, this, resembles, many, sea, ducks, merginae, notably, the, smaller, goldeneyes, bucephala, but, is, distinct, from, most, cormorants, which, rarely, have, white, feathers, and, if, so, usually, as, large, rounded, patches, rather, than, delicate, patterns, all, species, of, loons, have, a, spear, shaped, bill, males, are, larger, on, average, but, relative, size, is, only, apparent, when, the, male, and, female, are, together, in, winter, plumage, is, dark, grey, above, with, some, indistinct, lighter, mottling, on, the, wings, and, a, white, chin, throat, and, underside, the, specific, species, can, then, be, distinguished, by, certain, features, such, as, the, size, and, colour, of, the, head, neck, back, and, bill, but, reliable, identification, of, loons, in, winter, is, often, difficult, even, for, experts, particularly, as, the, smaller, immature, birds, look, similar, to, winter, plumage, adults, making, size, an, unreliable, means, of, identification, gaviiformes, are, among, the, few, groups, of, birds, in, which, the, young, moult, into, a, second, coat, of, down, feathers, after, shedding, the, first, one, rather, than, growing, juvenile, feathers, with, downy, tips, that, wear, off, as, is, typical, in, many, birds, this, trait, is, also, found, in, tubenoses, procellariiformes, and, penguins, sphenisciformes, both, relatives, of, the, loons, loons, are, excellent, swimmers, using, their, feet, to, propel, themselves, above, and, under, water, however, since, their, feet, are, located, far, back, on, the, body, loons, have, difficulty, walking, on, land, though, they, can, effectively, run, short, distances, to, reach, water, when, frightened, thus, loons, avoid, coming, to, land, except, for, mating, and, nesting, loons, fly, strongly, though, they, have, high, wing, loading, mass, to, wing, area, ratio, which, complicates, takeoff, indeed, most, species, must, run, upwind, across, the, water, s, surface, with, wings, flapping, to, generate, sufficient, lift, to, take, flight, only, the, red, throated, loon, g, stellata, can, take, off, from, land, once, airborne, loons, are, capable, of, long, flights, during, migration, scientists, from, the, u, s, geological, survey, who, have, implanted, satellite, transmitters, in, some, individuals, have, recorded, daily, flights, of, up, to, 1078, km, in, a, 24, hour, period, which, probably, resulted, from, single, movements, north, european, loons, migrate, primarily, via, the, south, baltic, and, directly, over, land, to, the, black, sea, or, mediterranean, loons, can, live, as, long, as, 30, years, and, can, hold, their, breath, for, as, long, as, 90, seconds, while, underwater, loons, are, migratory, birds, and, in, the, winter, months, they, move, from, their, northern, freshwater, lake, nesting, habitats, to, southern, marine, coastlines, they, are, well, adapted, to, this, change, in, salinity, however, because, they, have, special, salt, glands, located, directly, above, their, eyes, these, glands, filter, out, salts, in, their, blood, and, flush, this, salty, solution, out, through, their, nasal, passages, which, allows, them, to, immediately, consume, fish, from, oceans, and, drink, saltwater, after, their, long, migration, loons, find, their, prey, by, sight, they, eat, mainly, fish, supplemented, with, amphibians, crustaceans, and, similar, mid, sized, aquatic, fauna, specifically, they, have, been, noted, to, feed, on, crayfish, frogs, snails, salamanders, and, leeches, they, prefer, clear, lakes, because, they, can, more, easily, see, their, prey, through, the, water, the, loon, uses, its, pointy, bill, to, stab, or, grasp, prey, they, eat, vertebrate, prey, headfirst, to, facilitate, swallowing, and, swallow, all, their, prey, whole, to, help, digestion, loons, swallow, small, pebbles, from, the, bottoms, of, lakes, similar, to, grit, eaten, by, chickens, these, gastroliths, may, assist, the, loon, s, gizzard, in, crushing, the, hard, parts, of, the, loon, s, food, such, as, the, exoskeletons, of, crustaceans, and, the, bones, of, frogs, and, salamanders, the, gastroliths, may, also, be, involved, in, stomach, cleaning, as, an, aid, to, regurgitation, of, indigestible, food, parts, loons, may, inadvertently, ingest, small, lead, pellets, released, by, anglers, and, hunters, that, will, contribute, to, lead, poisoning, and, the, loon, s, eventual, death, jurisdictions, that, have, banned, the, use, of, lead, shot, and, sinkers, include, but, are, not, limited, to, maine, new, hampshire, vermont, michigan, some, areas, of, massachusetts, yellowstone, national, park, canada, great, britain, and, denmark, loons, nest, during, the, summer, on, freshwater, lakes, and, or, large, ponds, smaller, bodies, of, water, up, to, 0, 5, km, 2, will, usually, only, have, one, pair, larger, lakes, may, have, more, than, one, pair, with, each, pair, occupying, a, bay, or, section, of, the, lake, the, red, throated, loon, however, may, nest, colonially, several, pairs, close, together, in, small, arctic, tarns, and, feed, at, sea, or, in, larger, lakes, ferrying, the, food, in, for, the, young, loons, mate, on, land, often, on, the, future, nest, site, and, build, their, nests, close, to, the, water, preferring, sites, that, are, completely, surrounded, by, water, such, as, islands, or, emergent, vegetation, loons, use, a, variety, of, materials, to, build, their, nests, including, aquatic, vegetation, pine, needles, leaves, grass, moss, and, mud, sometimes, nest, material, is, almost, lacking, both, male, and, female, build, the, nest, and, incubate, jointly, for, 28, days, if, the, eggs, are, lost, the, pair, may, re, nest, usually, in, a, different, location, since, the, nest, is, very, close, to, the, water, rising, water, may, induce, the, birds, to, slowly, move, the, nest, upwards, over, a, metre, despite, the, roughly, equal, participation, of, the, sexes, in, nest, building, and, incubation, analysis, has, shown, clearly, that, males, alone, select, the, location, of, the, nest, this, pattern, has, the, important, consequence, that, male, loons, but, not, females, establish, significant, site, familiarity, with, their, territories, that, allows, them, to, produce, more, chicks, there, over, time, sex, biased, site, familiarity, might, explain, in, part, why, resident, males, fight, so, hard, to, defend, their, territories, most, clutches, consist, of, two, eggs, which, are, laid, in, may, or, june, depending, upon, latitude, loon, chicks, are, precocial, able, to, swim, and, dive, right, away, but, will, often, ride, on, their, parents, back, during, their, first, two, weeks, to, rest, conserve, heat, and, avoid, predators, chicks, are, fed, mainly, by, their, parents, for, about, six, weeks, but, gradually, begin, to, feed, themselves, over, time, by, 11, or, 12, weeks, chicks, gather, almost, all, of, their, own, food, and, have, begun, to, fly, in, 2019, a, necropsy, of, a, bald, eagle, found, floating, on, a, maine, lake, beside, the, floating, body, of, a, loon, chick, found, that, the, eagle, had, been, stabbed, through, the, heart, by, an, adult, loon, s, beak, biologists, especially, from, chapman, university, have, extensively, studied, the, mating, behaviour, of, the, common, loon, g, immer, contrary, to, popular, belief, pairs, seldom, mate, for, life, indeed, a, typical, adult, loon, is, likely, to, have, several, mates, during, its, lifetime, because, of, territorial, takeover, each, breeding, pair, must, frequently, defend, its, territory, against, floaters, territory, less, adults, trying, to, evict, at, least, one, owner, and, seize, the, breeding, site, territories, that, have, produced, chicks, in, the, past, year, are, especially, prone, to, takeovers, because, nonbreeding, loons, use, chicks, as, cues, to, indicate, high, quality, territories, one, third, of, all, territorial, evictions, among, males, result, in, the, death, of, the, owner, in, contrast, female, loons, usually, survive, birds, that, are, displaced, from, a, territory, but, survive, usually, try, to, re, mate, and, re, claim, a, breeding, territory, later, in, life, in, 2020, a, loon, hatched, for, the, first, time, in, over, a, century, in, southeastern, massachusetts, at, fall, river, the, massachusetts, division, of, fisheries, and, wildlife, and, biodiversity, research, institute, the, chicks, were, relocated, in, 2015, with, the, hopes, of, re, establishing, breeding, and, nesting, patterns, the, european, anglophone, name, diver, comes, from, the, bird, s, habit, of, catching, fish, by, swimming, calmly, along, the, surface, and, then, abruptly, plunging, into, the, water, the, north, american, name, loon, likely, comes, from, either, the, old, english, word, lumme, meaning, lummox, or, awkward, person, or, the, scandinavian, word, lum, meaning, lame, or, clumsy, either, way, the, name, refers, to, the, loon, s, poor, ability, to, walk, on, land, another, possible, derivation, is, from, the, norwegian, word, lom, for, these, birds, which, comes, from, old, norse, l, mr, possibly, cognate, with, english, lament, referring, to, the, characteristic, plaintive, sound, of, the, loon, the, scientific, name, gavia, refers, to, seabirds, in, general, the, scientific, name, gavia, was, the, latin, term, for, the, smew, mergellus, albellus, this, small, sea, duck, is, quite, unrelated, to, loons, and, just, happens, to, be, another, black, and, white, seabird, which, swims, and, dives, for, fish, it, is, not, likely, that, the, ancient, romans, had, much, knowledge, of, loons, as, these, are, limited, to, more, northern, latitudes, and, since, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, seem, to, have, occurred, only, as, rare, winter, migrants, in, the, mediterranean, region, the, term, gavia, was, transferred, from, the, ducks, to, the, loons, only, in, the, 18th, century, earlier, naturalists, referred, to, the, loons, as, mergus, the, latin, term, for, diving, seabirds, of, all, sorts, or, colymbus, which, became, the, genus, name, used, in, the, first, modern, scientific, description, of, a, gavia, species, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, unfortunately, confusion, about, whether, linnaeus, wastebin, genus, colymbus, referred, to, loons, or, grebes, abounded, north, american, ornithologists, used, the, genus, name, to, refer, to, grebes, while, europeans, used, it, for, loons, following, nicholas, aylward, vigors, and, richard, bowdler, sharpe, the, international, commission, on, zoological, nomenclature, tried, to, settle, this, issue, in, 1956, by, declaring, colymbus, a, suppressed, name, unfit, for, further, use, and, establishing, gavia, created, by, johann, reinhold, forster, in, 1788, as, the, valid, genus, name, for, the, loons, however, the, situation, was, not, completely, resolved, even, then, and, the, following, year, the, iczn, had, to, act, again, to, prevent, louis, pierre, vieillot, s, 1818, almost, forgotten, family, name, urinatoridae, from, overruling, the, much, younger, gaviidae, some, eminent, ornithologists, such, as, pierce, brodkorb, tried, to, keep, the, debate, alive, but, the, iczn, s, solution, has, been, satisfactory, all, living, species, are, placed, in, the, genus, gavia, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, genus, gavia, originated, in, europe, during, the, paleogene, the, earliest, species, g, egeriana, was, found, in, early, miocene, deposits, in, dolnice, in, the, czech, republic, during, the, remainder, of, the, miocene, gavia, managed, to, disperse, into, north, america, via, the, atlantic, coastlines, eventually, making, their, way, to, the, continent, s, pacific, coastlines, by, the, late, miocene, study, of, the, interrelationships, of, the, extant, species, has, found, that, the, red, throated, loons, are, the, most, basal, of, the, five, species, gavia, stellata, g, arctica, g, pacifica, g, immer, g, adamsii, gavia, egeriana, g, schultzi, g, howardae, g, stellata, g, brodkorbi, g, paradoxa, g, moldavica, g, concinna, g, arctica, g, pacifica, g, fortis, g, adamsii, g, immer, nearly, ten, prehistoric, species, have, been, named, to, date, in, the, genus, gavia, and, about, as, many, undescribed, ones, await, further, study, the, genus, is, known, from, the, early, miocene, onwards, and, the, oldest, members, are, rather, small, some, are, smaller, than, the, red, throated, loon, throughout, the, late, neogene, the, genus, by, and, large, follows, cope, s, rule, that, population, lineages, tend, to, increase, in, body, size, over, evolutionary, time, list, of, fossil, gavia, species, list, of, fossil, gavia, specimens, gavia, portisi, from, the, late, pliocene, of, orciano, pisano, italy, is, known, from, a, cervical, vertebra, that, may, or, may, not, have, been, from, a, loon, if, so, it, was, from, a, bird, slightly, smaller, than, the, common, loon, older, authors, were, quite, sure, the, bone, was, indeed, from, a, gavia, and, even, considered, g, concinna, a, possibly, junior, synonym, of, it, this, is, now, regarded, as, rather, unlikely, due, to, the, quite, distinct, range, and, age, the, early, pliocene, gavia, skull, from, empoli, italy, was, referred, to, g, concinna, and, thus, could, conceivably, have, been, of, g, portisi, if, that, was, indeed, a, loon, the, holotype, vertebra, may, now, be, lost, which, would, make, g, portisi, a, nomen, dubium
