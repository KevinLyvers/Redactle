gibbons, b, n, z, are, apes, in, the, family, hylobatidae, h, a, l, b, t, d, i, the, family, historically, contained, one, genus, but, now, is, split, into, four, extant, genera, and, 20, species, gibbons, live, in, subtropical, and, tropical, forests, from, eastern, bangladesh, to, northeast, india, to, southern, china, and, indonesia, including, the, islands, of, sumatra, borneo, and, java, also, called, the, lesser, apes, gibbons, differ, from, the, great, apes, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and, humans, in, being, smaller, exhibiting, low, sexual, dimorphism, and, not, making, nests, like, all, of, the, apes, gibbons, are, tailless, unlike, most, of, the, great, apes, gibbons, frequently, form, long, term, pair, bonds, their, primary, mode, of, locomotion, brachiation, involves, swinging, from, branch, to, branch, for, distances, up, to, 15, m, 50, ft, at, speeds, as, fast, as, 55, km, h, 34, mph, they, can, also, make, leaps, up, to, 8, m, 26, ft, and, walk, bipedally, with, their, arms, raised, for, balance, they, are, the, fastest, of, all, tree, dwelling, nonflying, mammals, depending, on, the, species, and, sex, gibbons, fur, coloration, varies, from, dark, to, light, brown, shades, and, any, shade, between, black, and, white, though, a, completely, white, gibbon, is, rare, the, english, word, gibbon, is, a, reborrowing, from, french, and, may, originally, derive, from, an, orang, asli, word, whole, genome, molecular, dating, analyses, indicate, that, the, gibbon, lineage, diverged, from, that, of, great, apes, around, 16, 8, million, years, ago, mya, 95, confidence, interval, 15, 9, 17, 6, mya, given, a, divergence, of, 29, mya, from, old, world, monkeys, adaptive, divergence, associated, with, chromosomal, rearrangements, led, to, rapid, radiation, of, the, four, genera, 5, 7, mya, each, genus, comprises, a, distinct, well, delineated, lineage, but, the, sequence, and, timing, of, divergences, among, these, genera, has, been, hard, to, resolve, even, with, whole, genome, data, due, to, radiative, speciations, and, extensive, incomplete, lineage, sorting, an, analysis, based, on, morphology, suggests, that, the, four, genera, are, ordered, as, symphalangus, nomascus, hoolock, hylobates, symphalangus, nomascus, hoolock, hylobates, a, coalescent, based, species, tree, analysis, of, genome, scale, datasets, suggests, a, phylogeny, for, the, four, genera, ordered, as, hylobates, nomascus, hoolock, symphalangus, hylobates, nomascus, hoolock, symphalangus, at, the, species, level, estimates, from, mitochondrial, dna, genome, analyses, suggest, that, hylobates, pileatus, diverged, from, h, lar, and, h, agilis, around, 3, 9, mya, and, h, lar, and, h, agilis, separated, around, 3, 3, mya, whole, genome, analysis, suggests, divergence, of, h, pileatus, from, h, moloch, 1, 5, 3, 0, mya, the, extinct, bunopithecus, sericus, is, a, gibbon, or, gibbon, like, ape, which, until, recently, was, thought, to, be, closely, related, to, the, hoolock, gibbons, the, family, is, divided, into, four, genera, based, on, their, diploid, chromosome, number, hylobates, 44, hoolock, 38, nomascus, 52, and, symphalangus, 50, also, three, extinct, genera, currently, are, recognised, bunopithecus, junzi, and, yuanmoupithecus, family, hylobatidae, gibbons, many, gibbons, are, hard, to, identify, based, on, fur, coloration, so, are, identified, either, by, song, or, genetics, these, morphological, ambiguities, have, led, to, hybrids, in, zoos, zoos, often, receive, gibbons, of, unknown, origin, so, they, rely, on, morphological, variation, or, labels, that, are, impossible, to, verify, to, assign, species, and, subspecies, names, so, separate, species, of, gibbons, commonly, are, misidentified, and, housed, together, interspecific, hybrids, within, a, genus, are, also, suspected, to, occur, in, wild, gibbons, where, their, ranges, overlap, no, records, exist, however, of, fertile, hybrids, between, different, gibbon, genera, either, in, the, wild, or, in, captivity, one, unique, aspect, of, a, gibbon, s, anatomy, is, the, wrist, which, functions, something, like, a, ball, and, socket, joint, allowing, for, biaxial, movement, this, greatly, reduces, the, amount, of, energy, needed, in, the, upper, arm, and, torso, while, also, reducing, stress, on, the, shoulder, joint, gibbons, also, have, long, hands, and, feet, with, a, deep, cleft, between, the, first, and, second, digits, of, their, hands, their, fur, is, usually, black, gray, or, brownish, often, with, white, markings, on, hands, feet, and, face, some, species, such, as, the, siamang, have, an, enlarged, throat, sac, which, inflates, and, serves, as, a, resonating, chamber, when, the, animals, call, this, structure, can, become, quite, large, in, some, species, sometimes, equaling, the, size, of, the, animal, s, head, their, voices, are, much, more, powerful, than, that, of, any, human, singer, although, they, are, at, best, half, a, human, s, height, gibbon, skulls, and, teeth, resemble, those, of, the, great, apes, and, their, noses, are, similar, to, those, of, all, catarrhine, primates, the, dental, formula, is, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, the, siamang, which, is, the, largest, of, the, 18, species, is, distinguished, by, having, two, fingers, on, each, foot, stuck, together, hence, the, generic, and, species, names, symphalangus, and, syndactylus, like, all, primates, gibbons, are, social, animals, they, are, strongly, territorial, and, defend, their, boundaries, with, vigorous, visual, and, vocal, displays, the, vocal, element, which, can, often, be, heard, for, distances, up, to, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, consists, of, a, duet, between, a, mated, pair, with, their, young, sometimes, joining, in, in, most, species, males, and, some, females, sing, solos, to, attract, mates, as, well, as, advertise, their, territories, the, song, can, be, used, to, identify, not, only, which, species, of, gibbon, is, singing, but, also, the, area, from, which, it, comes, gibbons, often, retain, the, same, mate, for, life, although, they, do, not, always, remain, sexually, monogamous, in, addition, to, extra, pair, copulations, pair, bonded, gibbons, occasionally, divorce, gibbons, are, among, nature, s, best, brachiators, their, ball, and, socket, wrist, joints, allow, them, unmatched, speed, and, accuracy, when, swinging, through, trees, nonetheless, their, mode, of, transportation, can, lead, to, hazards, when, a, branch, breaks, or, a, hand, slips, and, researchers, estimate, that, the, majority, of, gibbons, suffer, bone, fractures, one, or, more, times, during, their, lifetimes, they, are, the, fastest, of, all, tree, dwelling, nonflying, mammals, on, the, ground, gibbons, tend, to, walk, bipedally, and, their, achilles, tendon, morphology, is, more, similar, to, that, of, humans, than, that, of, any, other, ape, gibbons, diets, are, about, 60, fruit, based, but, they, also, consume, twigs, leaves, insects, flowers, and, occasionally, birds, eggs, gibbons, were, the, first, apes, to, diverge, from, the, common, ancestor, of, humans, and, apes, about, 16, 8, mya, with, a, genome, that, has, a, 96, similarity, to, humans, the, gibbon, has, a, role, as, a, bridge, between, old, world, monkeys, such, as, macaques, and, the, great, apes, according, to, a, study, that, mapped, synteny, genes, occurring, on, the, same, chromosome, disruptions, in, the, gibbon, and, human, genome, humans, and, great, apes, are, part, of, the, same, superfamily, hominoidea, with, gibbons, the, karyotype, of, gibbons, however, diverged, in, a, much, more, rapid, fashion, from, the, common, hominoid, ancestor, than, other, apes, the, common, ancestor, of, hominoids, is, shown, to, have, a, minimum, of, 24, major, chromosomal, rearrangements, from, the, presumed, gibbon, ancestor, s, karyotype, reaching, the, common, gibbon, ancestor, s, karyotype, from, today, s, various, living, species, of, gibbons, will, require, up, to, 28, additional, rearrangements, adding, up, this, implies, that, at, least, 52, major, chromosomal, rearrangements, are, needed, to, compare, the, common, hominoid, ancestor, to, today, s, gibbons, no, common, specific, sequence, element, in, the, independent, rearrangements, was, found, while, 46, of, the, gibbon, human, synteny, breakpoints, occur, in, segmental, duplication, regions, this, is, an, indication, that, these, major, differences, in, humans, and, gibbons, could, have, had, a, common, source, of, plasticity, or, change, researchers, view, this, unusually, high, rate, of, chromosomal, rearrangement, that, is, specific, in, small, apes, such, as, gibbons, could, potentially, be, due, to, factors, that, increase, the, rate, of, chromosomal, breakage, or, factors, that, allow, derivative, chromosomes, to, be, fixed, in, a, homozygous, state, while, mostly, lost, in, other, mammals, the, whole, genome, of, the, gibbons, in, southeast, asia, was, first, sequenced, in, 2014, by, the, german, primate, center, including, christian, roos, markus, brameier, and, lutz, walter, along, with, other, international, researchers, one, of, the, gibbons, that, had, its, genome, sequenced, is, a, white, cheeked, gibbon, nomascus, leucogenys, nle, named, asia, the, team, found, that, a, jumping, dna, element, named, lava, transposon, also, called, gibbon, specific, retrotransposon, is, unique, to, the, gibbon, genome, apart, from, humans, and, the, great, apes, the, lava, transposon, increases, mutation, rate, thus, is, supposed, to, have, contributed, to, the, rapid, and, greater, change, in, gibbons, in, comparison, to, their, close, relatives, which, is, critical, for, evolutionary, development, the, very, high, rate, of, chromosomal, disorder, and, rearrangements, such, as, duplications, deletions, or, inversions, of, large, stretches, of, dna, due, to, the, moving, of, this, large, dna, segment, is, one, of, the, key, features, that, are, unique, to, the, gibbon, genome, a, special, feature, of, the, lava, transposon, is, that, it, positioned, itself, precisely, between, genes, that, are, involved, in, chromosome, segregation, and, distribution, during, cell, division, which, results, in, a, premature, termination, state, leading, to, an, alteration, in, transcription, this, incorporation, of, the, jumping, gene, near, genes, involved, in, chromosome, replication, is, thought, to, make, the, rearrangement, in, the, genome, even, more, likely, leading, to, a, greater, diversity, within, the, gibbon, genera, in, addition, some, characteristic, genes, in, the, gibbon, genome, had, gone, through, a, positive, selection, and, are, suggested, to, give, rise, to, specific, anatomical, features, for, gibbons, to, adapt, to, their, new, environment, one, of, them, is, tbx5, which, is, a, gene, that, is, required, for, the, development, of, the, front, extremities, or, forelimbs, such, as, long, arms, the, other, is, col1a1, which, is, responsible, for, the, development, of, collagen, a, protein, that, is, directly, involved, with, the, forming, of, connective, tissues, bone, and, cartilage, this, gene, is, thought, to, have, a, role, in, gibbons, stronger, muscles, researchers, have, found, a, coincidence, between, major, environmental, changes, in, southeast, asia, about, 5, mya, that, caused, a, cyclical, dynamic, of, expansions, and, contractions, of, their, forest, habitat, an, instance, of, radiation, experienced, by, the, gibbon, genera, this, may, have, led, to, the, development, of, a, suite, of, physical, characteristics, distinct, from, their, great, ape, relatives, to, adapt, to, their, habitat, of, dense, canopy, forest, these, crucial, findings, in, genetics, have, contributed, to, the, use, of, gibbons, as, a, genetic, model, for, chromosome, breakage, and, fusion, which, is, a, type, of, translocation, mutation, the, unusually, high, number, of, structural, changes, in, the, dna, and, chromosomal, rearrangements, could, lead, to, problematic, consequences, in, some, species, gibbons, however, not, only, seemed, to, be, free, from, problems, but, let, the, change, help, them, effectively, adapt, to, their, environment, thus, gibbons, are, organisms, on, which, genetics, research, could, be, focused, to, broaden, the, implications, to, human, diseases, related, to, chromosomal, changes, such, as, cancer, including, chronic, myeloid, leukemia, most, species, are, either, endangered, or, critically, endangered, the, sole, exception, being, h, leuconedys, which, is, vulnerable, primarily, due, to, degradation, or, loss, of, their, forest, habitats, on, the, island, of, phuket, in, thailand, a, volunteer, based, gibbon, rehabilitation, center, rescues, gibbons, that, were, kept, in, captivity, and, are, being, released, back, into, the, wild, the, kalaweit, project, also, has, gibbon, rehabilitation, centers, on, borneo, and, sumatra, the, iucn, species, survival, commission, primate, specialist, group, announced, 2015, to, be, the, year, of, the, gibbon, and, initiated, events, to, be, held, around, the, world, in, zoos, to, promote, awareness, of, the, status, of, gibbons, sinologist, robert, van, gulik, concluded, gibbons, were, widespread, in, central, and, southern, china, until, at, least, the, song, dynasty, and, furthermore, based, on, an, analysis, of, references, to, primates, in, chinese, poetry, and, other, literature, and, their, portrayal, in, chinese, paintings, the, chinese, word, yu, n, referred, specifically, to, gibbons, until, they, were, extirpated, throughout, most, of, the, country, due, to, habitat, destruction, around, the, 14th, century, in, modern, usage, however, yu, n, is, a, generic, word, for, ape, early, chinese, writers, viewed, the, noble, gibbons, gracefully, moving, high, in, the, treetops, as, the, gentlemen, j, nz, of, the, forest, in, contrast, to, the, greedy, macaques, attracted, by, human, food, the, taoists, ascribed, occult, properties, to, gibbons, believing, them, to, be, able, to, live, for, several, hundred, years, and, to, turn, into, humans, gibbon, figurines, as, old, as, from, the, fourth, to, third, centuries, bce, the, zhou, dynasty, have, been, found, in, china, later, on, gibbons, became, a, popular, subject, for, chinese, painters, especially, during, the, song, dynasty, and, early, yuan, dynasty, when, y, yu, nj, and, m, q, f, ch, ng, excelled, in, painting, these, apes, from, chinese, cultural, influence, the, zen, motif, of, the, gibbon, grasping, at, the, reflection, of, the, moon, in, the, water, became, popular, in, japanese, art, as, well, though, gibbons, have, never, occurred, naturally, in, japan
