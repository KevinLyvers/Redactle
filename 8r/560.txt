geckos, are, small, mostly, carnivorous, lizards, that, have, a, wide, distribution, found, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, belonging, to, the, infraorder, gekkota, geckos, are, found, in, warm, climates, throughout, the, world, they, range, from, 1, 6, to, 60, centimetres, 0, 6, to, 23, 6, inches, geckos, are, unique, among, lizards, for, their, vocalisations, which, differ, from, species, to, species, most, geckos, in, the, family, gekkonidae, use, chirping, or, clicking, sounds, in, their, social, interactions, tokay, geckos, gekko, gecko, are, known, for, their, loud, mating, calls, and, some, other, species, are, capable, of, making, hissing, noises, when, alarmed, or, threatened, they, are, the, most, species, rich, group, of, lizards, with, about, 1, 500, different, species, worldwide, all, geckos, except, species, in, the, family, eublepharidae, lack, eyelids, instead, the, outer, surface, of, the, eyeball, has, a, transparent, membrane, the, brille, they, have, a, fixed, lens, within, each, iris, that, enlarges, in, darkness, to, let, in, more, light, since, they, cannot, blink, species, without, eyelids, generally, lick, their, own, brilles, when, they, need, to, clear, them, of, dust, and, dirt, in, order, to, keep, them, clean, and, moist, unlike, most, lizards, geckos, are, usually, nocturnal, and, have, excellent, night, vision, their, colour, vision, in, low, light, is, 350, times, more, sensitive, than, human, eyes, the, nocturnal, geckos, evolved, from, diurnal, species, which, had, lost, the, rod, cells, from, their, eyes, the, gecko, eye, therefore, modified, its, cone, cells, that, increased, in, size, into, different, types, both, single, and, double, three, different, photo, pigments, have, been, retained, and, are, sensitive, to, ultraviolet, blue, and, green, they, also, use, a, multifocal, optical, system, that, allows, them, to, generate, a, sharp, image, for, at, least, two, different, depths, while, most, gecko, species, are, nocturnal, some, species, are, diurnal, and, active, during, the, day, which, have, evolved, multiple, times, independently, many, species, are, well, known, for, their, specialised, toe, pads, which, enable, them, to, grab, and, climb, onto, smooth, and, vertical, surfaces, and, even, cross, indoor, ceilings, with, ease, geckos, are, well, known, to, people, who, live, in, warm, regions, of, the, world, where, several, species, make, their, home, inside, human, habitations, these, for, example, the, house, gecko, become, part, of, the, indoor, menagerie, and, are, often, welcomed, as, they, feed, on, insect, pests, including, moths, and, mosquitoes, like, most, lizards, geckos, can, lose, their, tails, in, defence, a, process, called, autotomy, the, predator, may, attack, the, wriggling, tail, allowing, the, gecko, to, escape, the, largest, species, gigarcanum, delcourti, is, only, known, from, a, single, stuffed, specimen, probably, collected, in, the, 19th, century, found, in, the, basement, of, the, natural, history, museum, of, marseille, in, marseille, france, this, gecko, was, 600, millimetres, 24, inches, long, and, it, was, likely, endemic, to, new, caledonia, where, it, lived, in, native, forests, the, smallest, gecko, the, jaragua, sphaero, is, a, mere, 16, millimetres, 0, 63, inches, long, and, was, discovered, in, 2001, on, a, small, island, off, the, coast, of, hispaniola, the, neo, latin, gekko, and, english, gecko, stem, from, indonesian, malaysian, g, koq, it, is, a, malay, word, borrowed, from, javanese, from, tokek, which, imitates, the, sounds, that, some, species, like, tokay, gecko, make, 120, 253, like, other, reptiles, geckos, are, ectothermic, producing, very, little, metabolic, heat, essentially, a, gecko, s, body, temperature, is, dependent, on, its, environment, also, to, accomplish, their, main, functions, such, as, locomotion, feeding, reproduction, etc, geckos, must, have, a, relatively, elevated, temperature, all, geckos, shed, their, skin, at, fairly, regular, intervals, with, species, differing, in, timing, and, method, leopard, geckos, shed, at, about, two, to, four, week, intervals, the, presence, of, moisture, aids, in, the, shedding, when, shedding, begins, the, gecko, speeds, the, process, by, detaching, the, loose, skin, from, its, body, and, eating, it, for, young, geckos, shedding, occurs, more, frequently, once, a, week, but, when, they, are, fully, grown, they, shed, once, every, one, to, two, months, about, 60, of, gecko, species, have, adhesive, toe, pads, which, allow, them, to, adhere, to, most, surfaces, without, the, use, of, liquids, or, surface, tension, such, pads, have, been, gained, and, lost, repeatedly, over, the, course, of, gecko, evolution, adhesive, toepads, evolved, independently, in, about, eleven, different, gecko, lineages, and, were, lost, in, at, least, nine, lineages, it, was, previously, thought, that, the, spatula, shaped, setae, arranged, in, lamellae, on, gecko, footpads, enable, attractive, van, der, waals, forces, the, weakest, of, the, weak, chemical, forces, between, the, keratin, lamellae, setae, spatulae, structures, and, the, surface, these, van, der, waals, interactions, involve, no, fluids, in, theory, a, boot, made, of, synthetic, setae, would, adhere, as, easily, to, the, surface, of, the, international, space, station, as, it, would, to, a, living, room, wall, although, adhesion, varies, with, humidity, however, a, 2014, study, suggests, that, gecko, adhesion, is, in, fact, mainly, determined, by, electrostatic, interaction, caused, by, contact, electrification, not, van, der, waals, or, capillary, forces, the, setae, on, the, feet, of, geckos, are, also, self, cleaning, and, usually, remove, any, clogging, dirt, within, a, few, steps, polytetrafluoroethylene, ptfe, which, has, very, low, surface, energy, is, more, difficult, for, geckos, to, adhere, to, than, many, other, surfaces, gecko, adhesion, is, typically, improved, by, higher, humidity, even, on, hydrophobic, surfaces, yet, is, reduced, under, conditions, of, complete, immersion, in, water, the, role, of, water, in, that, system, is, under, discussion, yet, recent, experiments, agree, that, the, presence, of, molecular, water, layers, water, molecules, carry, a, very, large, dipole, moment, on, the, setae, as, well, as, on, the, surface, increase, the, surface, energy, of, both, therefore, the, energy, gain, in, getting, these, surfaces, in, contact, is, enlarged, which, results, in, an, increased, gecko, adhesion, force, moreover, the, elastic, properties, of, the, b, keratin, change, with, water, uptake, gecko, toes, seem, to, be, double, jointed, but, this, is, a, misnomer, and, is, properly, called, digital, hyperextension, gecko, toes, can, hyperextend, in, the, opposite, direction, from, human, fingers, and, toes, this, allows, them, to, overcome, the, van, der, waals, force, by, peeling, their, toes, off, surfaces, from, the, tips, inward, in, essence, by, this, peeling, action, the, gecko, separates, spatula, by, spatula, from, the, surface, so, for, each, spatula, separation, only, some, force, necessary, the, process, is, similar, to, removing, scotch, tape, from, a, surface, geckos, toes, operate, well, below, their, full, attractive, capabilities, most, of, the, time, because, the, margin, for, error, is, great, depending, upon, the, surface, roughness, and, therefore, the, number, of, setae, in, contact, with, that, surface, use, of, small, van, der, waals, force, requires, very, large, surface, areas, every, square, millimetre, of, a, gecko, s, footpad, contains, about, 14, 000, hair, like, setae, each, seta, has, a, diameter, of, 5, m, human, hair, varies, from, 18, to, 180, m, so, the, cross, sectional, area, of, a, human, hair, is, equivalent, to, 12, to, 1300, setae, each, seta, is, in, turn, tipped, with, between, 100, and, 1, 000, spatulae, each, spatula, is, 0, 2, m, long, one, five, millionth, of, a, metre, or, just, below, the, wavelength, of, visible, light, the, setae, of, a, typical, mature, 70, gram, 2, 5, ounce, gecko, would, be, capable, of, supporting, a, weight, of, 133, kilograms, 293, pounds, each, spatula, could, exert, an, adhesive, force, of, 5, to, 25, nn, the, exact, value, of, the, adhesion, force, of, a, spatula, varies, with, the, surface, energy, of, the, substrate, to, which, it, adheres, recent, studies, have, moreover, shown, that, the, component, of, the, surface, energy, derived, from, long, range, forces, such, as, van, der, waals, forces, depends, on, the, material, s, structure, below, the, outermost, atomic, layers, up, to, 100, nm, beneath, the, surface, taking, that, into, account, the, adhesive, strength, can, be, inferred, apart, from, the, setae, phospholipids, fatty, substances, produced, naturally, in, their, bodies, also, come, into, play, these, lipids, lubricate, the, setae, and, allow, the, gecko, to, detach, its, foot, before, the, next, step, the, origin, of, gecko, adhesion, likely, started, as, simple, modifications, to, the, epidermis, on, the, underside, of, the, toes, this, was, recently, discovered, in, the, genus, gonatodes, from, south, america, simple, elaborations, of, the, epidermal, spinules, into, setae, have, enabled, gonatodes, humeralis, to, climb, smooth, surfaces, and, sleep, on, smooth, leaves, biomimetic, technologies, designed, to, mimic, gecko, adhesion, could, produce, reusable, self, cleaning, dry, adhesives, with, many, applications, development, effort, is, being, put, into, these, technologies, but, manufacturing, synthetic, setae, is, not, a, trivial, material, design, task, gecko, skin, does, not, generally, bear, scales, but, appears, at, a, macro, scale, as, a, papillose, surface, which, is, made, from, hair, like, protuberances, developed, across, the, entire, body, these, confer, superhydrophobicity, and, the, unique, design, of, the, hair, confers, a, profound, antimicrobial, action, these, protuberances, are, very, small, up, to, 4, microns, in, length, and, tapering, to, a, point, gecko, skin, has, been, observed, to, have, an, anti, bacterial, property, killing, gram, negative, bacteria, when, they, come, in, contact, with, the, skin, the, mossy, leaf, tailed, gecko, of, madagascar, u, sikorae, has, coloration, developed, as, camouflage, most, being, greyish, brown, to, black, or, greenish, brown, with, various, markings, meant, to, resemble, tree, bark, down, to, the, lichens, and, moss, found, on, the, bark, it, also, has, flaps, of, skin, running, the, length, of, its, body, head, and, limbs, known, as, the, dermal, flap, which, it, can, lay, against, the, tree, during, the, day, scattering, shadows, and, making, its, outline, practically, invisible, geckos, are, polyphyodonts, and, able, to, replace, each, of, their, 100, teeth, every, 3, to, 4, months, next, to, the, full, grown, tooth, there, is, a, small, replacement, tooth, developing, from, the, odontogenic, stem, cell, in, the, dental, lamina, the, formation, of, the, teeth, is, pleurodont, they, are, fused, ankylosed, by, their, sides, to, the, inner, surface, of, the, jaw, bones, this, formation, is, common, in, all, species, in, the, order, squamata, the, infraorder, gekkota, is, divided, into, seven, families, containing, about, 125, genera, of, geckos, including, the, snake, like, legless, pygopods, legless, lizards, of, the, family, dibamidae, also, referred, to, as, blind, lizards, have, occasionally, been, counted, as, gekkotans, but, recent, molecular, phylogenies, suggest, otherwise, diplodactylidae, carphodactylidae, pygopodidae, eublepharidae, sphaerodactylidae, phyllodactylidae, gekkonidae, several, species, of, lizard, from, the, late, jurassic, have, been, considered, early, relatives, of, geckos, the, most, prominent, and, most, well, supported, being, the, arboreal, eichstaettisaurus, from, the, late, jurassic, of, germany, norellius, from, the, early, cretaceous, of, mongolia, is, also, usually, placed, as, a, close, relative, of, geckos, the, oldest, known, fossils, of, modern, geckos, are, from, the, mid, cretaceous, burmese, amber, of, myanmar, including, cretaceogekko, around, 100, million, years, old, which, have, adhesive, pads, on, the, feet, similar, to, those, of, living, geckos, more, than, 1, 850, species, of, geckos, occur, worldwide, including, these, familiar, species, most, geckos, lay, a, small, clutch, of, eggs, some, are, live, bearing, and, a, few, can, reproduce, asexually, via, parthenogenesis, geckos, also, have, a, large, diversity, of, sex, determining, mechanisms, including, temperature, dependent, sex, determination, and, both, xx, xy, and, zz, zw, sex, chromosomes, with, multiple, transitions, among, them, over, evolutionary, time, madagascar, day, geckos, engage, in, a, mating, ritual, in, which, sexually, mature, males, produce, a, waxy, substance, from, pores, on, the, back, of, their, legs, males, approach, females, with, a, head, swaying, motion, along, with, rapid, tongue, flicking, in, the, female, obligate, parthenogenesis, as, a, reproductive, system, has, evolved, multiple, times, in, the, family, gekkonidae, it, has, been, shown, that, oocytes, are, able, to, undergo, meiosis, in, three, different, obligate, parthenogenetic, complexes, of, geckos, an, extra, premeiotic, endoreplication, of, chromosomes, is, essential, for, obligate, parthenogenesis, in, these, geckos, appropriate, segregation, during, meiosis, to, form, viable, progeny, is, facilitated, by, the, formation, of, bivalents, made, from, copies, of, identical, chromosomes
