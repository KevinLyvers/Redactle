guineafowl, n, i, f, a, l, or, guineahen, are, birds, of, the, family, numididae, in, the, order, galliformes, they, are, endemic, to, africa, and, rank, among, the, oldest, of, the, gallinaceous, birds, phylogenetically, they, branched, off, from, the, core, galliformes, after, the, cracidae, chachalacas, guans, and, curassows, and, before, the, odontophoridae, new, world, quail, an, eocene, fossil, lineage, telecrex, has, been, associated, with, guineafowl, telecrex, inhabited, mongolia, and, may, have, given, rise, to, the, oldest, of, the, true, phasianids, such, as, blood, pheasants, and, eared, pheasants, which, evolved, into, high, altitude, montane, adapted, species, with, the, rise, of, the, tibetan, plateau, while, modern, guineafowl, species, are, endemic, to, africa, the, helmeted, guineafowl, has, been, introduced, as, a, domesticated, bird, widely, elsewhere, this, is, a, list, of, guineafowl, species, presented, in, taxonomic, order, cladogram, based, on, a, study, by, de, chen, and, collaborators, published, in, 2021, numida, agelastes, guttera, acryllium, the, insect, and, seed, eating, ground, nesting, birds, of, this, family, resemble, partridges, but, with, featherless, heads, though, both, members, of, the, genus, guttera, have, a, distinctive, black, crest, and, the, vulturine, guineafowl, has, a, downy, brown, patch, on, the, nape, most, species, of, guineafowl, have, a, dark, grey, or, blackish, plumage, with, dense, white, spots, but, both, members, of, the, genus, agelastes, lack, the, spots, while, several, species, are, relatively, well, known, the, plumed, guineafowl, and, the, two, members, of, the, genus, agelastes, remain, relatively, poorly, known, these, large, birds, measure, 40, 71, cm, 15, 1, 2, 28, in, in, length, and, weigh, 700, 1, 600, g, 1, lb, 9, oz, 3, lb, 8, oz, guinea, hens, weigh, more, than, guinea, cocks, possibly, because, of, the, larger, reproductive, organs, in, the, female, compared, to, the, male, guineafowl, also, the, presence, of, relatively, larger, egg, clusters, in, the, dual, purpose, guinea, hens, may, be, a, factor, that, contributes, to, the, higher, body, weight, of, the, guinea, hens, the, species, for, which, information, is, known, are, normally, monogamous, mating, for, life, or, are, serially, monogamous, however, occasional, exceptions, have, been, recorded, for, helmeted, and, kenya, crested, guineafowl, which, have, been, reported, to, be, polygamous, in, captivity, all, guineafowl, are, social, and, typically, live, in, small, groups, or, large, flocks, though, they, are, monogamous, species, of, the, least, derived, genera, guttera, agelastes, and, acryllium, tend, toward, social, polyandry, a, trait, shared, with, other, primitive, galliforms, such, as, roul, roul, and, congo, peafowl, guineafowl, travel, behind, herd, animals, and, beneath, monkey, troops, where, they, forage, within, manure, and, on, items, that, have, fallen, to, the, understory, from, the, canopy, they, play, a, pivotal, role, in, the, control, of, ticks, flies, locusts, scorpions, and, other, invertebrates, they, pluck, maggots, from, carcasses, and, manure, wild, guineafowl, are, strong, flyers, their, breast, muscles, are, dark, aerobic, metabolism, enabling, them, to, sustain, themselves, in, flight, for, considerable, distances, if, hard, pressed, grass, and, bush, fires, are, a, constant, threat, to, them, and, flight, is, the, most, effective, escape, some, species, of, guineafowl, like, the, vulturine, may, go, without, drinking, water, for, extended, periods, instead, sourcing, their, moisture, from, their, food, young, guineafowl, called, keets, are, very, sensitive, to, weather, in, particular, cold, temperatures, guinea, hens, are, not, known, to, be, good, mothers, but, in, the, wild, the, guinea, hen, s, mate, a, guinea, cock, may, help, tend, the, young, keets, during, the, day, by, keeping, them, warm, and, finding, food, sometimes, more, than, one, cock, helps, raise, the, young, guineafowl, hens, and, cocks, together, make, good, parents, during, warm, weather, the, cock, is, unlikely, to, sit, on, the, keets, during, the, night, leaving, that, duty, to, the, hen, but, may, help, the, hen, keep, them, warm, at, night, when, temperatures, drop, below, freezing, guineafowl, may, be, trained, to, go, into, a, coop, instead, of, roosting, in, trees, when, very, young, once, hatched, and, ready, to, leave, the, brooder, around, three, weeks, they, may, be, enclosed, in, a, coop, for, at, least, three, days, so, they, learn, where, home, is, when, guinea, parents, that, already, roost, in, a, coop, raise, their, own, keets, the, hen, sits, on, them, outdoors, at, night, but, then, the, parents, teach, the, keets, to, also, go, into, the, coop, in, the, evenings, around, three, weeks, of, age, males, and, females, have, different, calls, which, can, be, used, to, differentiate, between, them, unlike, chickens, which, generally, do, best, with, one, rooster, for, a, flock, of, hens, guineafowl, do, well, with, one, cock, for, each, hen, guineafowl, have, been, shown, to, act, as, a, deterrent, to, foxes, due, to, the, spread, of, lyme, disease, from, ticks, guineafowl, are, often, kept, because, they, will, eat, the, ticks, guineafowl, species, are, found, across, sub, saharan, africa, some, almost, in, the, entire, range, others, more, localized, such, as, the, plumed, guineafowl, in, west, central, africa, and, the, vulturine, guineafowl, in, north, east, africa, they, live, in, semiopen, habitats, such, as, savanna, or, semideserts, while, some, such, as, the, black, guineafowl, mainly, inhabit, forests, some, perch, high, on, treetops, the, helmeted, guineafowl, has, been, introduced, in, east, africa, south, america, the, west, indies, the, united, states, britain, and, india, where, it, is, raised, as, food, or, pets, guineafowl, meat, is, moist, firmer, and, leaner, than, chicken, meat, and, has, a, slight, gamey, flavour, it, has, marginally, more, protein, than, chicken, or, turkey, roughly, half, the, fat, of, chicken, and, slightly, less, food, energy, per, gram, their, eggs, are, substantially, richer, than, those, of, chickens
