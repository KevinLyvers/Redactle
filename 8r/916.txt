the, douglas, fir, pseudotsuga, menziesii, is, an, evergreen, conifer, species, in, the, pine, family, pinaceae, it, is, native, to, western, north, america, and, is, also, known, as, douglas, fir, douglas, spruce, oregon, pine, and, columbian, pine, there, are, three, varieties, coast, douglas, fir, p, menziesii, var, menziesii, rocky, mountain, douglas, fir, p, menziesii, var, glauca, and, mexican, douglas, fir, p, menziesii, var, lindleyana, despite, its, common, names, it, is, not, a, true, fir, genus, abies, spruce, genus, picea, or, pine, genus, pinus, it, is, also, not, a, hemlock, the, genus, name, pseudotsuga, means, false, hemlock, douglas, firs, are, medium, size, to, extremely, large, evergreen, trees, 20, 100, metres, 70, 330, feet, tall, although, only, pseudotsuga, menziesii, var, menziesii, common, name, coast, douglas, firs, reach, heights, near, 100, m, and, commonly, reach, 2, 4, m, 8, ft, in, diameter, although, trees, with, diameters, of, almost, 5, metres, 16, feet, exist, the, largest, coast, douglas, firs, regularly, live, over, 500, years, with, the, oldest, specimens, living, for, over, 1, 300, years, rocky, mountain, douglas, firs, found, further, to, the, east, are, less, long, lived, usually, not, exceeding, 400, years, in, age, there, are, records, of, former, coast, douglas, firs, exceeding, 120, metres, 390, feet, in, height, which, if, alive, today, would, make, it, the, tallest, tree, species, on, earth, particular, historical, specimens, with, heights, exceeding, 400, feet, include, the, lynn, valley, tree, and, the, nooksack, giant, the, leaves, are, flat, soft, linear, needles, 2, 4, centimetres, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, in, long, generally, resembling, those, of, the, firs, occurring, singly, rather, than, in, fascicles, they, completely, encircle, the, branches, which, can, be, useful, in, recognizing, the, species, as, the, trees, grow, taller, in, denser, forest, they, lose, their, lower, branches, such, that, the, foliage, may, start, as, high, as, 34, m, 110, ft, off, the, ground, douglas, firs, in, environments, with, more, light, may, have, branches, much, closer, to, the, ground, the, bark, on, young, trees, is, thin, smooth, grey, and, contains, numerous, resin, blisters, on, mature, trees, usually, exceeding, 80, years, it, is, very, thick, and, corky, growing, up, to, 36, cm, 14, in, thick, with, distinctive, deep, vertical, fissures, caused, by, the, gradual, expansion, of, the, growing, tree, some, of, the, mature, bark, is, brown, while, other, parts, are, lighter, colored, with, a, cork, like, texture, these, develop, in, multiple, layers, this, thick, bark, makes, the, douglas, fir, perhaps, the, most, fire, resistant, tree, native, to, the, pacific, northwest, the, female, cones, are, pendulous, with, persistent, scales, unlike, those, of, true, firs, they, have, distinctive, long, trifid, three, pointed, bracts, which, protrude, prominently, above, each, scale, and, are, said, to, resemble, the, back, half, of, a, mouse, with, two, feet, and, a, tail, the, massive, mega, genome, of, douglas, fir, was, sequenced, in, 2017, by, the, large, pinerefseq, consortium, revealing, a, specialized, photosynthetic, apparatus, in, the, light, harvesting, complex, of, genes, the, common, name, honors, david, douglas, a, scottish, botanist, and, collector, who, first, reported, the, extraordinary, nature, and, potential, of, the, species, the, common, name, is, misleading, since, it, is, not, a, true, fir, i, e, not, a, member, of, the, genus, abies, for, this, reason, the, name, is, often, written, as, douglas, fir, a, name, also, used, for, the, genus, pseudotsuga, as, a, whole, the, specific, epithet, menziesii, is, after, archibald, menzies, a, scottish, physician, and, rival, naturalist, to, david, douglas, menzies, first, documented, the, tree, on, vancouver, island, in, 1791, colloquially, the, species, is, also, known, simply, as, doug, fir, or, douglas, pine, although, the, latter, common, name, may, also, refer, to, pinus, douglasiana, other, names, for, this, tree, have, included, oregon, pine, british, columbian, pine, puget, sound, pine, douglas, spruce, false, hemlock, red, fir, or, red, pine, although, again, red, pine, may, refer, to, a, different, tree, species, pinus, resinosa, and, red, fir, may, refer, to, abies, magnifica, one, coast, salish, name, for, the, tree, used, in, the, halkomelem, language, is, l, yelhp, in, the, lushootseed, language, the, tree, is, called, bidac, pseudotsuga, menziesii, var, menziesii, the, coast, douglas, fir, grows, in, the, coastal, regions, from, west, central, british, columbia, southward, to, central, california, in, oregon, and, washington, its, range, is, continuous, from, the, eastern, edge, of, the, cascades, west, to, the, pacific, coast, ranges, and, pacific, ocean, in, california, it, is, found, in, the, klamath, and, california, coast, ranges, as, far, south, as, the, santa, lucia, range, with, a, small, stand, as, far, south, as, the, purisima, hills, in, santa, barbara, county, one, of, the, last, remaining, old, growth, stands, of, conifers, is, in, the, mattole, watershed, and, is, under, threat, of, logging, in, the, sierra, nevada, it, ranges, as, far, south, as, the, yosemite, region, it, occurs, from, sea, level, along, the, coast, to, elevations, of, 1, 500, m, 4, 900, ft, or, higher, and, inland, in, some, cases, up, to, 2, 100, m, 6, 900, ft, another, variety, exists, further, inland, pseudotsuga, menziesii, var, glauca, the, rocky, mountain, douglas, fir, or, interior, douglas, fir, interior, douglas, fir, intergrades, with, coast, douglas, fir, in, the, cascades, of, northern, washington, and, southern, british, columbia, and, from, there, ranges, northward, to, central, british, columbia, and, southeastward, to, the, mexican, border, becoming, increasingly, disjunct, as, latitude, decreases, and, altitude, increases, mexican, douglas, fir, p, lindleyana, which, ranges, as, far, south, as, oaxaca, is, often, considered, a, variety, of, p, menziesii, fossils, wood, pollen, of, pseudotsuga, are, recorded, from, the, miocene, and, pliocene, of, europe, siebengebirge, gleiwitz, austria, it, is, also, naturalised, throughout, europe, argentina, and, chile, called, pino, oreg, n, in, new, zealand, it, is, considered, to, be, an, invasive, species, called, a, wilding, conifer, and, is, subject, to, control, measures, but, is, also, one, of, the, most, common, lumber, trees, used, in, forestry, alongside, radiata, pine, with, large, plantations, throughout, the, country, the, species, was, introduced, in, the, 1900s, for, its, wood, douglas, fir, prefers, acidic, or, neutral, soils, however, it, exhibits, considerable, morphological, plasticity, and, on, drier, sites, p, menziesii, var, menziesii, will, generate, deeper, taproots, pseudotsuga, menziesii, var, glauca, exhibits, even, greater, plasticity, occurring, in, stands, of, interior, temperate, rainforest, in, british, columbia, as, well, as, at, the, edge, of, semi, arid, sagebrush, steppe, throughout, much, of, its, range, where, it, generates, even, deeper, taproots, still, the, coast, douglas, fir, variety, is, the, dominant, tree, west, of, the, cascade, mountains, in, the, pacific, northwest, it, occurs, in, nearly, all, forest, types, and, competes, well, on, most, parent, materials, aspects, and, slopes, adapted, to, a, more, moist, mild, climate, than, the, interior, subspecies, it, grows, larger, and, faster, than, rocky, mountain, douglas, fir, associated, trees, include, western, hemlock, sitka, spruce, sugar, pine, western, white, pine, ponderosa, pine, grand, fir, coast, redwood, western, redcedar, california, incense, cedar, lawson, s, cypress, tanoak, bigleaf, maple, and, several, others, pure, stands, are, also, common, particularly, north, of, the, umpqua, river, in, oregon, it, is, most, dominant, in, areas, with, a, more, frequent, fire, regime, that, suppresses, less, fire, resistant, conifers, douglas, fir, seeds, are, an, extremely, important, food, source, for, small, mammals, such, as, moles, shrews, and, chipmunks, which, consume, an, estimated, 65, of, each, annual, seed, crop, the, douglas, squirrel, harvests, and, hoards, great, quantities, of, douglas, fir, cones, and, also, consumes, mature, pollen, cones, the, inner, bark, terminal, shoots, and, developing, young, needles, mature, or, old, growth, douglas, fir, forest, is, the, primary, habitat, of, the, red, tree, vole, arborimus, longicaudus, and, the, spotted, owl, strix, occidentalis, home, range, requirements, for, breeding, pairs, of, spotted, owls, are, at, least, 400, hectares, 4, 0, km, 2, 990, acres, of, old, growth, red, tree, voles, may, also, be, found, in, immature, forests, if, douglas, fir, is, a, significant, component, the, red, vole, nests, almost, exclusively, in, the, foliage, of, the, trees, typically, 2, 50, metres, 5, 165, ft, above, the, ground, and, its, diet, consists, chiefly, of, douglas, fir, needles, douglas, fir, needles, are, generally, poor, browse, for, ungulates, although, in, the, winter, when, other, food, sources, are, lacking, it, can, become, important, and, black, tailed, deer, browse, new, seedlings, and, saplings, in, spring, and, summer, the, spring, diet, of, the, blue, grouse, features, douglas, fir, needles, prominently, the, leaves, are, also, used, by, the, woolly, conifer, aphid, adelges, cooleyi, this, 0, 5, mm, long, sap, sucking, insect, is, conspicuous, on, the, undersides, of, the, leaves, by, the, small, white, fluff, spots, of, protective, wax, that, it, produces, it, is, often, present, in, large, numbers, and, can, cause, the, foliage, to, turn, yellowish, from, the, damage, it, causes, exceptionally, trees, may, be, partially, defoliated, by, it, but, the, damage, is, rarely, this, severe, among, lepidoptera, apart, from, some, that, feed, on, pseudotsuga, in, general, the, gelechiid, moths, chionodes, abella, and, c, periculella, as, well, as, the, cone, scale, eating, tortrix, moth, cydia, illutana, have, been, recorded, specifically, on, p, menziesii, the, inner, bark, is, the, primary, winter, food, for, the, north, american, porcupine, poriol, is, a, flavanone, a, type, of, flavonoid, produced, by, p, menziesii, in, reaction, to, infection, by, poria, weirii, a, parasitic, plant, which, uses, p, menziesii, is, the, douglas, fir, dwarf, mistletoe, arceuthobium, douglasii, epiphytes, such, as, crustose, lichens, and, mosses, are, common, sights, on, douglas, firs, as, it, is, only, moderately, shade, tolerant, undisturbed, douglas, fir, stands, in, humid, areas, will, eventually, give, way, to, later, successional, more, shade, tolerant, associates, such, as, the, western, redcedar, and, western, hemlock, though, this, process, may, take, a, thousand, years, or, more, it, is, more, shade, tolerant, than, some, associated, fire, dependent, species, such, as, western, larch, and, ponderosa, pine, and, often, replaces, these, species, further, inland, fungal, diseases, such, as, laminated, root, rot, and, shoestring, root, rot, can, cause, significant, damage, and, in, plantation, settings, dominated, by, douglas, fir, monocultures, may, cause, extreme, damage, to, vast, swathes, of, trees, interplanting, with, resistant, or, nonhost, species, such, as, western, redcedar, and, beaked, hazelnut, can, reduce, this, risk, other, threats, to, douglas, fir, include, red, ring, rot, and, the, douglas, fir, beetle, many, different, native, american, groups, used, the, bark, resin, and, needles, to, make, herbal, treatments, for, various, diseases, native, hawaiians, built, wa, a, kaulua, double, hulled, canoes, from, coast, douglas, fir, logs, that, had, drifted, ashore, the, wood, has, historically, been, favored, as, firewood, especially, from, the, coastal, variety, in, addition, early, settlers, used, douglas, fir, for, all, forms, of, building, construction, including, floors, beams, and, fine, carving, even, today, much, of, the, northwest, chain, saw, art, is, completed, on, douglas, fir, logs, the, structures, built, from, fir, have, lasted, 150, years, and, more, the, species, is, extensively, used, in, forestry, management, as, a, plantation, tree, for, softwood, timber, douglas, fir, is, one, of, the, world, s, best, timber, producing, species, and, yields, more, timber, than, any, other, species, in, north, america, making, the, forestlands, of, western, oregon, washington, and, british, columbia, the, most, productive, on, the, continent, in, 2011, douglas, fir, represented, 34, 2, of, us, lumber, exports, to, a, total, of, 1, 053, billion, board, feet, douglas, fir, timber, is, used, for, timber, frame, construction, and, timber, trusses, using, traditional, joinery, veneer, and, flooring, due, to, its, strength, hardness, and, durability, as, of, 2012, the, only, wooden, ships, still, currently, in, use, by, the, u, s, navy, are, avenger, class, minesweepers, made, of, douglas, fir, douglas, fir, sees, wide, use, in, heavy, timber, structures, as, its, wood, is, strong, available, in, a, number, of, specifications, including, kiln, dried, and, grade, stamped, and, can, be, supplied, in, very, long, lengths, to, 60, feet, west, coast, mills, are, sophisticated, in, their, processing, of, timbers, making, lead, times, predictable, and, availability, reliable, paints, adhere, well, to, douglas, fir, stains, perform, well, on, douglas, fir, timbers, with, the, mild, caution, that, the, natural, color, of, this, species, varies, and, care, must, be, taken, to, ensure, uniformity, of, color, pitch, pockets, that, may, ooze, resin, can, be, present, in, timbers, that, have, not, been, kiln, dried, because, of, the, timber, sizes, available, stamped, timber, grading, and, relatively, short, lead, times, douglas, fir, sees, wide, use, in, both, public, and, residential, projects, the, species, has, ornamental, value, in, large, parks, and, gardens, it, has, been, commonly, used, as, a, christmas, tree, since, the, 1920s, and, the, trees, are, typically, grown, on, plantations, the, buds, have, been, used, to, flavor, eau, de, vie, a, clear, colorless, fruit, brandy, douglas, fir, pine, leaves, can, be, used, to, make, pine, needle, tea, they, possess, a, tangy, citrus, flavor, and, may, serve, in, some, recipes, as, a, wild, substitute,
