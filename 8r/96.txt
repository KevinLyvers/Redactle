https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_smell
the, sense, of, smell, or, olfaction, is, the, special, sense, through, which, smells, or, odors, are, perceived, the, sense, of, smell, has, many, functions, including, detecting, desirable, foods, hazards, and, pheromones, and, plays, a, role, in, taste, in, humans, it, occurs, when, an, odor, binds, to, a, receptor, within, the, nasal, cavity, transmitting, a, signal, through, the, olfactory, system, glomeruli, aggregate, signals, from, these, receptors, and, transmit, them, to, the, olfactory, bulb, where, the, sensory, input, will, start, to, interact, with, parts, of, the, brain, responsible, for, smell, identification, memory, and, emotion, there, are, many, different, things, which, can, interfere, with, a, normal, sense, of, smell, including, damage, to, the, nose, or, smell, receptors, anosmia, upper, respiratory, infections, traumatic, brain, injury, and, neurodegenerative, disease, early, scientific, study, of, the, sense, of, smell, includes, the, extensive, doctoral, dissertation, of, eleanor, gamble, published, in, 1898, which, compared, olfactory, to, other, stimulus, modalities, and, implied, that, smell, had, a, lower, intensity, discrimination, as, the, epicurean, and, atomistic, roman, philosopher, lucretius, 1st, century, bce, speculated, different, odors, are, attributed, to, different, shapes, and, sizes, of, atoms, odor, molecules, in, the, modern, understanding, that, stimulate, the, olfactory, organ, a, modern, demonstration, of, that, theory, was, the, cloning, of, olfactory, receptor, proteins, by, linda, b, buck, and, richard, axel, who, were, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, 2004, and, subsequent, pairing, of, odor, molecules, to, specific, receptor, proteins, each, odor, receptor, molecule, recognizes, only, a, particular, molecular, feature, or, class, of, odor, molecules, mammals, have, about, a, thousand, genes, that, code, for, odor, reception, of, the, genes, that, code, for, odor, receptors, only, a, portion, are, functional, humans, have, far, fewer, active, odor, receptor, genes, than, other, primates, and, other, mammals, in, mammals, each, olfactory, receptor, neuron, expresses, only, one, functional, odor, receptor, odor, receptor, nerve, cells, function, like, a, key, lock, system, if, the, airborne, molecules, of, a, certain, chemical, can, fit, into, the, lock, the, nerve, cell, will, respond, there, are, at, present, a, number, of, competing, theories, regarding, the, mechanism, of, odor, coding, and, perception, according, to, the, shape, theory, each, receptor, detects, a, feature, of, the, odor, molecule, the, weak, shape, theory, known, as, the, odotope, theory, suggests, that, different, receptors, detect, only, small, pieces, of, molecules, and, these, minimal, inputs, are, combined, to, form, a, larger, olfactory, perception, similar, to, the, way, visual, perception, is, built, up, of, smaller, information, poor, sensations, combined, and, refined, to, create, a, detailed, overall, perception, according, to, a, new, study, researchers, have, found, that, a, functional, relationship, exists, between, molecular, volume, of, odorants, and, the, olfactory, neural, response, an, alternative, theory, the, vibration, theory, proposed, by, luca, turin, posits, that, odor, receptors, detect, the, frequencies, of, vibrations, of, odor, molecules, in, the, infrared, range, by, quantum, tunnelling, however, the, behavioral, predictions, of, this, theory, have, been, called, into, question, there, is, no, theory, yet, that, explains, olfactory, perception, completely, flavor, perception, is, an, aggregation, of, auditory, taste, haptic, and, smell, sensory, information, retronasal, smell, plays, the, biggest, role, in, the, sensation, of, flavor, during, the, process, of, mastication, the, tongue, manipulates, food, to, release, odorants, these, odorants, enter, the, nasal, cavity, during, exhalation, the, smell, of, food, has, the, sensation, of, being, in, the, mouth, because, of, co, activation, of, the, motor, cortex, and, olfactory, epithelium, during, mastication, smell, taste, and, trigeminal, receptors, also, called, chemesthesis, together, contribute, to, flavor, the, human, tongue, can, distinguish, only, among, five, distinct, qualities, of, taste, while, the, nose, can, distinguish, among, hundreds, of, substances, even, in, minute, quantities, it, is, during, exhalation, that, the, smell, s, contribution, to, flavor, occurs, in, contrast, to, that, of, proper, smell, which, occurs, during, the, inhalation, phase, of, breathing, the, olfactory, system, is, the, only, human, sense, that, bypasses, the, thalamus, and, connects, directly, to, the, forebrain, smell, and, sound, information, has, been, shown, to, converge, in, the, olfactory, tubercles, of, rodents, this, neural, convergence, is, proposed, to, give, rise, to, a, perception, termed, smound, whereas, a, flavor, results, from, interactions, between, smell, and, taste, a, smound, may, result, from, interactions, between, smell, and, sound, the, mhc, genes, known, as, hla, in, humans, are, a, group, of, genes, present, in, many, animals, and, important, for, the, immune, system, in, general, offspring, from, parents, with, differing, mhc, genes, have, a, stronger, immune, system, fish, mice, and, female, humans, are, able, to, smell, some, aspect, of, the, mhc, genes, of, potential, sex, partners, and, prefer, partners, with, mhc, genes, different, from, their, own, humans, can, detect, blood, relatives, from, olfaction, mothers, can, identify, by, body, odor, their, biological, children, but, not, their, stepchildren, pre, adolescent, children, can, olfactorily, detect, their, full, siblings, but, not, half, siblings, or, step, siblings, and, this, might, explain, incest, avoidance, and, the, westermarck, effect, functional, imaging, shows, that, this, olfactory, kinship, detection, process, involves, the, frontal, temporal, junction, the, insula, and, the, dorsomedial, prefrontal, cortex, but, not, the, primary, or, secondary, olfactory, cortices, or, the, related, piriform, cortex, or, orbitofrontal, cortex, since, inbreeding, is, detrimental, it, tends, to, be, avoided, in, the, house, mouse, the, major, urinary, protein, mup, gene, cluster, provides, a, highly, polymorphic, scent, signal, of, genetic, identity, that, appears, to, underlie, kin, recognition, and, inbreeding, avoidance, thus, there, are, fewer, matings, between, mice, sharing, mup, haplotypes, than, would, be, expected, if, there, were, random, mating, some, animals, use, scent, trails, to, guide, movement, for, example, social, insects, may, lay, down, a, trail, to, a, food, source, or, a, tracking, dog, may, follow, the, scent, of, its, target, a, number, of, scent, tracking, strategies, have, been, studied, in, different, species, including, gradient, search, or, chemotaxis, anemotaxis, klinotaxis, and, tropotaxis, their, success, is, influenced, by, the, turbulence, of, the, air, plume, that, is, being, followed, different, people, smell, different, odors, and, most, of, these, differences, are, caused, by, genetic, differences, although, odorant, receptor, genes, make, up, one, of, the, largest, gene, families, in, the, human, genome, only, a, handful, of, genes, have, been, linked, conclusively, to, particular, smells, for, instance, the, odorant, receptor, or5a1, and, its, genetic, variants, alleles, are, responsible, for, our, ability, or, failure, to, smell, ionone, a, key, aroma, in, foods, and, beverages, similarly, the, odorant, receptor, or2j3, is, associated, with, the, ability, to, detect, the, grassy, odor, cis, 3, hexen, 1, ol, the, preference, or, dislike, of, cilantro, coriander, has, been, linked, to, the, olfactory, receptor, or6a2, the, importance, and, sensitivity, of, smell, varies, among, different, organisms, most, mammals, have, a, good, sense, of, smell, whereas, most, birds, do, not, except, the, tubenoses, e, g, petrels, and, albatrosses, certain, species, of, new, world, vultures, and, the, kiwis, also, birds, have, hundreds, of, olfactory, receptors, although, recent, analysis, of, the, chemical, composition, of, volatile, organic, compounds, vocs, from, king, penguin, feathers, suggest, that, vocs, may, provide, olfactory, cues, used, by, the, penguins, to, locate, their, colony, and, recognize, individuals, among, mammals, it, is, well, developed, in, the, carnivores, and, ungulates, which, must, always, be, aware, of, each, other, and, in, those, that, smell, for, their, food, such, as, moles, having, a, strong, sense, of, smell, is, referred, to, as, macrosmatic, in, contrast, to, having, a, weak, sense, of, smell, which, is, referred, to, as, microsmotic, figures, suggesting, greater, or, lesser, sensitivity, in, various, species, reflect, experimental, findings, from, the, reactions, of, animals, exposed, to, aromas, in, known, extreme, dilutions, these, are, therefore, based, on, perceptions, by, these, animals, rather, than, mere, nasal, function, that, is, the, brain, s, smell, recognizing, centers, must, react, to, the, stimulus, detected, for, the, animal, to, be, said, to, show, a, response, to, the, smell, in, question, it, is, estimated, that, dogs, in, general, have, an, olfactory, sense, approximately, ten, thousand, to, a, hundred, thousand, times, more, acute, than, a, human, s, this, does, not, mean, they, are, overwhelmed, by, smells, our, noses, can, detect, rather, it, means, they, can, discern, a, molecular, presence, when, it, is, in, much, greater, dilution, in, the, carrier, air, scenthounds, as, a, group, can, smell, one, to, ten, million, times, more, acutely, than, a, human, and, bloodhounds, which, have, the, keenest, sense, of, smell, of, any, dogs, have, noses, ten, to, one, hundred, million, times, more, sensitive, than, a, human, s, they, were, bred, for, the, specific, purpose, of, tracking, humans, and, can, detect, a, scent, trail, a, few, days, old, the, second, most, sensitive, nose, is, possessed, by, the, basset, hound, which, was, bred, to, track, and, hunt, rabbits, and, other, small, animals, grizzly, bears, have, a, sense, of, smell, seven, times, stronger, than, that, of, the, bloodhound, essential, for, locating, food, underground, using, their, elongated, claws, bears, dig, deep, trenches, in, search, of, burrowing, animals, and, nests, as, well, as, roots, bulbs, and, insects, bears, can, detect, the, scent, of, food, from, up, to, eighteen, miles, away, because, of, their, immense, size, they, often, scavenge, new, kills, driving, away, the, predators, including, packs, of, wolves, and, human, hunters, in, the, process, the, sense, of, smell, is, less, developed, in, the, catarrhine, primates, and, nonexistent, in, cetaceans, which, compensate, with, a, well, developed, sense, of, taste, in, some, strepsirrhines, such, as, the, red, bellied, lemur, scent, glands, occur, atop, the, head, in, many, species, smell, is, highly, tuned, to, pheromones, a, male, silkworm, moth, for, example, can, sense, a, single, molecule, of, bombykol, fish, too, have, a, well, developed, sense, of, smell, even, though, they, inhabit, an, aquatic, environment, salmon, utilize, their, sense, of, smell, to, identify, and, return, to, their, home, stream, waters, catfish, use, their, sense, of, smell, to, identify, other, individual, catfish, and, to, maintain, a, social, hierarchy, many, fishes, use, the, sense, of, smell, to, identify, mating, partners, or, to, alert, to, the, presence, of, food, although, conventional, wisdom, and, lay, literature, based, on, impressionistic, findings, in, the, 1920s, have, long, presented, human, smell, as, capable, of, distinguishing, between, roughly, 10, 000, unique, odors, recent, research, has, suggested, that, the, average, individual, is, capable, of, distinguishing, over, one, trillion, unique, odors, researchers, in, the, most, recent, study, which, tested, the, psychophysical, responses, to, combinations, of, over, 128, unique, odor, molecules, with, combinations, composed, of, up, to, 30, different, component, molecules, noted, that, this, estimate, is, conservative, and, that, some, subjects, of, their, research, might, be, capable, of, deciphering, between, a, thousand, trillion, odorants, adding, that, their, worst, performer, could, probably, still, distinguish, between, 80, million, scents, authors, of, the, study, concluded, this, is, far, more, than, previous, estimates, of, distinguishable, olfactory, stimuli, it, demonstrates, that, the, human, olfactory, system, with, its, hundreds, of, different, olfactory, receptors, far, out, performs, the, other, senses, in, the, number, of, physically, different, stimuli, it, can, discriminate, however, it, was, also, noted, by, the, authors, that, the, ability, to, distinguish, between, smells, is, not, analogous, to, being, able, to, consistently, identify, them, and, that, subjects, were, not, typically, capable, of, identifying, individual, odor, stimulants, from, within, the, odors, the, researchers, had, prepared, from, multiple, odor, molecules, in, november, 2014, the, study, was, strongly, criticized, by, caltech, scientist, markus, meister, who, wrote, that, the, study, s, extravagant, claims, are, based, on, errors, of, mathematical, logic, the, logic, of, his, paper, has, in, turn, been, criticized, by, the, authors, of, the, original, paper, in, humans, and, other, vertebrates, smells, are, sensed, by, olfactory, sensory, neurons, in, the, olfactory, epithelium, the, olfactory, epithelium, is, made, up, of, at, least, six, morphologically, and, biochemically, different, cell, types, the, proportion, of, olfactory, epithelium, compared, to, respiratory, epithelium, not, innervated, or, supplied, with, nerves, gives, an, indication, of, the, animal, s, olfactory, sensitivity, humans, have, about, 10, cm, 2, 1, 6, sq, in, of, olfactory, epithelium, whereas, some, dogs, have, 170, cm, 2, 26, sq, in, a, dog, s, olfactory, epithelium, is, also, considerably, more, densely, innervated, with, a, hundred, times, more, receptors, per, square, centimeter, the, sensory, olfactory, system, integrates, with, other, senses, to, form, the, perception, of, flavor, often, land, organisms, will, have, separate, olfaction, systems, for, smell, and, taste, orthonasal, smell, and, retronasal, smell, but, water, dwelling, organisms, usually, have, only, one, system, molecules, of, odorants, passing, through, the, superior, nasal, concha, of, the, nasal, passages, dissolve, in, the, mucus, that, lines, the, superior, portion, of, the, cavity, and, are, detected, by, olfactory, receptors, on, the, dendrites, of, the, olfactory, sensory, neurons, this, may, occur, by, diffusion, or, by, the, binding, of, the, odorant, to, odorant, binding, proteins, the, mucus, overlying, the, epithelium, contains, mucopolysaccharides, salts, enzymes, and, antibodies, these, are, highly, important, as, the, olfactory, neurons, provide, a, direct, passage, for, infection, to, pass, to, the, brain, this, mucus, acts, as, a, solvent, for, odor, molecules, flows, constantly, and, is, replaced, approximately, every, ten, minutes, in, insects, smells, are, sensed, by, olfactory, sensory, neurons, in, the, chemosensory, sensilla, which, are, present, in, insect, antenna, palps, and, tarsa, but, also, on, other, parts, of, the, insect, body, odorants, penetrate, into, the, cuticle, pores, of, chemosensory, sensilla, and, get, in, contact, with, insect, odorant, binding, proteins, obps, or, chemosensory, proteins, csps, before, activating, the, sensory, neurons, the, binding, of, the, ligand, odor, molecule, or, odorant, to, the, receptor, leads, to, an, action, potential, in, the, receptor, neuron, via, a, second, messenger, pathway, depending, on, the, organism, in, mammals, the, odorants, stimulate, adenylate, cyclase, to, synthesize, camp, via, a, g, protein, called, g, olf, camp, which, is, the, second, messenger, here, opens, a, cyclic, nucleotide, gated, ion, channel, cng, producing, an, influx, of, cations, largely, ca, 2, with, some, na, into, the, cell, slightly, depolarising, it, the, ca, 2, in, turn, opens, a, ca, 2, activated, chloride, channel, leading, to, efflux, of, cl, further, depolarizing, the, cell, and, triggering, an, action, potential, ca, 2, is, then, extruded, through, a, sodium, calcium, exchanger, a, calcium, calmodulin, complex, also, acts, to, inhibit, the, binding, of, camp, to, the, camp, dependent, channel, thus, contributing, to, olfactory, adaptation, the, main, olfactory, system, of, some, mammals, also, contains, small, subpopulations, of, olfactory, sensory, neurons, that, detect, and, transduce, odors, somewhat, differently, olfactory, sensory, neurons, that, use, trace, amine, associated, receptors, taars, to, detect, odors, use, the, same, second, messenger, signaling, cascade, as, do, the, canonical, olfactory, sensory, neurons, other, subpopulations, such, as, those, that, express, the, receptor, guanylyl, cyclase, gc, d, gucy2d, or, the, soluble, guanylyl, cyclase, gucy1b2, use, a, cgmp, cascade, to, transduce, their, odorant, ligands, these, distinct, subpopulations, olfactory, subsystems, appear, specialized, for, the, detection, of, small, groups, of, chemical, stimuli, this, mechanism, of, transduction, is, somewhat, unusual, in, that, camp, works, by, directly, binding, to, the, ion, channel, rather, than, through, activation, of, protein, kinase, a, it, is, similar, to, the, transduction, mechanism, for, photoreceptors, in, which, the, second, messenger, cgmp, works, by, directly, binding, to, ion, channels, suggesting, that, maybe, one, of, these, receptors, was, evolutionarily, adapted, into, the, other, there, are, also, considerable, similarities, in, the, immediate, processing, of, stimuli, by, lateral, inhibition, averaged, activity, of, the, receptor, neurons, can, be, measured, in, several, ways, in, vertebrates, responses, to, an, odor, can, be, measured, by, an, electro, olfactogram, or, through, calcium, imaging, of, receptor, neuron, terminals, in, the, olfactory, bulb, in, insects, one, can, perform, electroantennography, or, calcium, imaging, within, the, olfactory, bulb, olfactory, sensory, neurons, project, axons, to, the, brain, within, the, olfactory, nerve, cranial, nerve, i, these, nerve, fibers, lacking, myelin, sheaths, pass, to, the, olfactory, bulb, of, the, brain, through, perforations, in, the, cribriform, plate, which, in, turn, projects, olfactory, information, to, the, olfactory, cortex, and, other, areas, the, axons, from, the, olfactory, receptors, converge, in, the, outer, layer, of, the, olfactory, bulb, within, small, 50, micrometers, in, diameter, structures, called, glomeruli, mitral, cells, located, in, the, inner, layer, of, the, olfactory, bulb, form, synapses, with, the, axons, of, the, sensory, neurons, within, glomeruli, and, send, the, information, about, the, odor, to, other, parts, of, the, olfactory, system, where, multiple, signals, may, be, processed, to, form, a, synthesized, olfactory, perception, a, large, degree, of, convergence, occurs, with, 25, 000, axons, synapsing, on, 25, or, so, mitral, cells, and, with, each, of, these, mitral, cells, projecting, to, multiple, glomeruli, mitral, cells, also, project, to, periglomerular, cells, and, granular, cells, that, inhibit, the, mitral, cells, surrounding, it, lateral, inhibition, granular, cells, also, mediate, inhibition, and, excitation, of, mitral, cells, through, pathways, from, centrifugal, fibers, and, the, anterior, olfactory, nuclei, neuromodulators, like, acetylcholine, serotonin, and, norepinephrine, all, send, axons, to, the, olfactory, bulb, and, have, been, implicated, in, gain, modulation, pattern, separation, and, memory, functions, respectively, the, mitral, cells, leave, the, olfactory, bulb, in, the, lateral, olfactory, tract, which, synapses, on, five, major, regions, of, the, cerebrum, the, anterior, olfactory, nucleus, the, olfactory, tubercle, the, amygdala, the, piriform, cortex, and, the, entorhinal, cortex, the, anterior, olfactory, nucleus, projects, via, the, anterior, commissure, to, the, contralateral, olfactory, bulb, inhibiting, it, the, piriform, cortex, has, two, major, divisions, with, anatomically, distinct, organizations, and, functions, the, anterior, piriform, cortex, apc, appears, to, be, better, at, determining, the, chemical, structure, of, the, odorant, molecules, and, the, posterior, piriform, cortex, ppc, has, a, strong, role, in, categorizing, odors, and, assessing, similarities, between, odors, e, g, minty, woody, and, citrus, are, odors, that, can, despite, being, highly, variant, chemicals, be, distinguished, via, the, ppc, in, a, concentration, independent, manner, the, piriform, cortex, projects, to, the, medial, dorsal, nucleus, of, the, thalamus, which, then, projects, to, the, orbitofrontal, cortex, the, orbitofrontal, cortex, mediates, conscious, perception, of, the, odor, the, three, layered, piriform, cortex, projects, to, a, number, of, thalamic, and, hypothalamic, nuclei, the, hippocampus, and, amygdala, and, the, orbitofrontal, cortex, but, its, function, is, largely, unknown, the, entorhinal, cortex, projects, to, the, amygdala, and, is, involved, in, emotional, and, autonomic, responses, to, odor, it, also, projects, to, the, hippocampus, and, is, involved, in, motivation, and, memory, odor, information, is, stored, in, long, term, memory, and, has, strong, connections, to, emotional, memory, this, is, possibly, due, to, the, olfactory, system, s, close, anatomical, ties, to, the, limbic, system, and, hippocampus, areas, of, the, brain, that, have, long, been, known, to, be, involved, in, emotion, and, place, memory, respectively, since, any, one, receptor, is, responsive, to, various, odorants, and, there, is, a, great, deal, of, convergence, at, the, level, of, the, olfactory, bulb, it, may, seem, strange, that, human, beings, are, able, to, distinguish, so, many, different, odors, it, seems, that, a, highly, complex, form, of, processing, must, be, occurring, however, as, it, can, be, shown, that, while, many, neurons, in, the, olfactory, bulb, and, even, the, pyriform, cortex, and, amygdala, are, responsive, to, many, different, odors, half, the, neurons, in, the, orbitofrontal, cortex, are, responsive, to, only, one, odor, and, the, rest, to, only, a, few, it, has, been, shown, through, microelectrode, studies, that, each, individual, odor, gives, a, particular, spatial, map, of, excitation, in, the, olfactory, bulb, it, is, possible, that, the, brain, is, able, to, distinguish, specific, odors, through, spatial, encoding, but, temporal, coding, must, also, be, taken, into, account, over, time, the, spatial, maps, change, even, for, one, particular, odor, and, the, brain, must, be, able, to, process, these, details, as, well, inputs, from, the, two, nostrils, have, separate, inputs, to, the, brain, with, the, result, that, when, each, nostril, takes, up, a, different, odorant, a, person, may, experience, perceptual, rivalry, in, the, olfactory, sense, akin, to, that, of, binocular, rivalry, in, insects, smells, are, sensed, by, sensilla, located, on, the, antenna, and, maxillary, palp, and, first, processed, by, the, antennal, lobe, analogous, to, the, olfactory, bulb, and, next, by, the, mushroom, bodies, and, lateral, horn, the, process, by, which, olfactory, information, is, coded, in, the, brain, to, allow, for, proper, perception, is, still, being, researched, and, is, not, completely, understood, when, an, odorant, is, detected, by, receptors, they, in, a, sense, break, the, odorant, down, and, then, the, brain, puts, the, odorant, back, together, for, identification, and, perception, the, odorant, binds, to, receptors, that, recognize, only, a, specific, functional, group, or, feature, of, the, odorant, which, is, why, the, chemical, nature, of, the, odorant, is, important, after, binding, the, odorant, the, receptor, is, activated, and, will, send, a, signal, to, the, glomeruli, in, the, olfactory, bulb, each, glomerulus, receives, signals, from, multiple, receptors, that, detect, similar, odorant, features, because, several, receptor, types, are, activated, due, to, the, different, chemical, features, of, the, odorant, several, glomeruli, are, activated, as, well, the, signals, from, the, glomeruli, are, transformed, to, a, pattern, of, oscillations, of, neural, activities, of, the, mitral, cells, the, output, neurons, from, the, olfactory, bulb, olfactory, bulb, sends, this, pattern, to, the, olfactory, cortex, olfactory, cortex, is, thought, to, have, associative, memories, so, that, it, resonates, to, this, bulbar, pattern, when, the, odor, object, is, recognized, the, cortex, sends, centrifugal, feedback, to, the, bulb, this, feedback, could, suppress, bulbar, responses, to, the, recognized, odor, objects, causing, olfactory, adaptation, to, background, odors, so, that, the, newly, arrived, foreground, odor, objects, could, be, singled, out, for, better, recognition, during, odor, search, feedback, could, also, be, used, to, enhance, odor, detection, the, distributed, code, allows, the, brain, to, detect, specific, odors, in, mixtures, of, many, background, odors, it, is, a, general, idea, that, the, layout, of, brain, structures, corresponds, to, physical, features, of, stimuli, called, topographic, coding, and, similar, analogies, have, been, made, in, smell, with, concepts, such, as, a, layout, corresponding, to, chemical, features, called, chemotopy, or, perceptual, features, while, chemotopy, remains, a, highly, controversial, concept, evidence, exists, for, perceptual, information, implemented, in, the, spatial, dimensions, of, olfactory, networks, many, animals, including, most, mammals, and, reptiles, but, not, humans, have, two, distinct, and, segregated, olfactory, systems, a, main, olfactory, system, which, detects, volatile, stimuli, and, an, accessory, olfactory, system, which, detects, fluid, phase, stimuli, behavioral, evidence, suggests, that, these, fluid, phase, stimuli, often, function, as, pheromones, although, pheromones, can, also, be, detected, by, the, main, olfactory, system, in, the, accessory, olfactory, system, stimuli, are, detected, by, the, vomeronasal, organ, located, in, the, vomer, between, the, nose, and, the, mouth, snakes, use, it, to, smell, prey, sticking, their, tongue, out, and, touching, it, to, the, organ, some, mammals, make, a, facial, expression, called, flehmen, to, direct, stimuli, to, this, organ, the, sensory, receptors, of, the, accessory, olfactory, system, are, located, in, the, vomeronasal, organ, as, in, the, main, olfactory, system, the, axons, of, these, sensory, neurons, project, from, the, vomeronasal, organ, to, the, accessory, olfactory, bulb, which, in, the, mouse, is, located, on, the, dorsal, posterior, portion, of, the, main, olfactory, bulb, unlike, in, the, main, olfactory, system, the, axons, that, leave, the, accessory, olfactory, bulb, do, not, project, to, the, brain, s, cortex, but, rather, to, targets, in, the, amygdala, and, bed, nucleus, of, the, stria, terminalis, and, from, there, to, the, hypothalamus, where, they, may, influence, aggression, and, mating, behavior, insect, olfaction, refers, to, the, function, of, chemical, receptors, that, enable, insects, to, detect, and, identify, volatile, compounds, for, foraging, predator, avoidance, finding, mating, partners, via, pheromones, and, locating, oviposition, habitats, thus, it, is, the, most, important, sensation, for, insects, most, important, insect, behaviors, must, be, timed, perfectly, which, is, dependent, on, what, they, smell, and, when, they, smell, it, for, example, smell, is, essential, for, hunting, in, many, species, of, wasps, including, polybia, sericea, the, two, organs, insects, primarily, use, for, detecting, odors, are, the, antennae, and, specialized, mouth, parts, called, the, maxillary, palps, however, a, recent, study, has, demonstrated, the, olfactory, role, of, ovipositor, in, fig, wasps, inside, of, these, olfactory, organs, there, are, neurons, called, olfactory, receptor, neurons, which, as, the, name, implies, house, receptors, for, scent, molecules, in, their, cell, membranes, the, majority, of, olfactory, receptor, neurons, typically, reside, in, the, antenna, these, neurons, can, be, very, abundant, for, example, drosophila, flies, have, 2, 600, olfactory, sensory, neurons, insects, are, capable, of, smelling, and, differentiating, between, thousands, of, volatile, compounds, both, sensitively, and, selectively, sensitivity, is, how, attuned, the, insect, is, to, very, small, amounts, of, an, odorant, or, small, changes, in, the, concentration, of, an, odorant, selectivity, refers, to, the, insects, ability, to, tell, one, odorant, apart, from, another, these, compounds, are, commonly, broken, into, three, classes, short, chain, carboxylic, acids, aldehydes, and, low, molecular, weight, nitrogenous, compounds, some, insects, such, as, the, moth, deilephila, elpenor, use, smell, as, a, means, to, find, food, sources, the, tendrils, of, plants, are, especially, sensitive, to, airborne, volatile, organic, compounds, parasites, such, as, dodder, make, use, of, this, in, locating, their, preferred, hosts, and, locking, on, to, them, the, emission, of, volatile, compounds, is, detected, when, foliage, is, browsed, by, animals, threatened, plants, are, then, able, to, take, defensive, chemical, measures, such, as, moving, tannin, compounds, to, their, foliage, scientists, have, devised, methods, for, quantifying, the, intensity, of, odors, in, particular, for, the, purpose, of, analyzing, unpleasant, or, objectionable, odors, released, by, an, industrial, source, into, a, community, since, the, 1800s, industrial, countries, have, encountered, incidents, where, proximity, of, an, industrial, source, or, landfill, produced, adverse, reactions, among, nearby, residents, regarding, airborne, odor, the, basic, theory, of, odor, analysis, is, to, measure, what, extent, of, dilution, with, pure, air, is, required, before, the, sample, in, question, is, rendered, indistinguishable, from, the, pure, or, reference, standard, since, each, person, perceives, odor, differently, an, odor, panel, composed, of, several, different, people, is, assembled, each, sniffing, the, same, sample, of, diluted, specimen, air, a, field, olfactometer, can, be, utilized, to, determine, the, magnitude, of, an, odor, many, air, management, districts, in, the, us, have, numerical, standards, of, acceptability, for, the, intensity, of, odor, that, is, allowed, to, cross, into, a, residential, property, for, example, the, bay, area, air, quality, management, district, has, applied, its, standard, in, regulating, numerous, industries, landfills, and, sewage, treatment, plants, example, applications, this, district, has, engaged, are, the, san, mateo, california, wastewater, treatment, plant, the, shoreline, amphitheatre, in, mountain, view, california, and, the, it, corporation, waste, ponds, martinez, california, systems, of, classifying, odors, include, specific, terms, are, used, to, describe, disorders, associated, with, smelling, viruses, can, also, infect, the, olfactory, epithelium, leading, to, a, loss, of, the, sense, of, olfaction, about, 50, of, patients, with, sars, cov, 2, causing, covid, 19, experience, some, type, of, disorder, associated, with, their, sense, of, smell, including, anosmia, and, parosmia, sars, cov, 1, mers, cov, and, even, the, flu, influenza, virus, can, also, disrupt, olfaction, media, related, to, smell, at,
