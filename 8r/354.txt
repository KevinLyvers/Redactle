a, snail, is, a, shelled, gastropod, the, name, is, most, often, applied, to, land, snails, terrestrial, pulmonate, gastropod, molluscs, however, the, common, name, snail, is, also, used, for, most, of, the, members, of, the, molluscan, class, gastropoda, that, have, a, coiled, shell, that, is, large, enough, for, the, animal, to, retract, completely, into, when, the, word, snail, is, used, in, this, most, general, sense, it, includes, not, just, land, snails, but, also, numerous, species, of, sea, snails, and, freshwater, snails, gastropods, that, naturally, lack, a, shell, or, have, only, an, internal, shell, are, mostly, called, slugs, and, land, snails, that, have, only, a, very, small, shell, that, they, cannot, retract, into, are, often, called, semi, slugs, snails, have, considerable, human, relevance, including, as, food, items, as, pests, and, as, vectors, of, disease, and, their, shells, are, used, as, decorative, objects, and, are, incorporated, into, jewelry, the, snail, has, also, had, some, cultural, significance, tending, to, be, associated, with, lethargy, the, snail, has, also, been, used, as, a, figure, of, speech, in, reference, to, slow, moving, things, snails, that, respire, using, a, lung, belong, to, the, group, pulmonata, as, traditionally, defined, the, pulmonata, were, found, to, be, polyphyletic, in, a, molecular, study, per, j, rger, et, al, dating, from, 2010, but, snails, with, gills, also, form, a, polyphyletic, group, in, other, words, snails, with, lungs, and, snails, with, gills, form, a, number, of, taxonomic, groups, that, are, not, necessarily, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, they, are, related, to, some, other, groups, both, snails, that, have, lungs, and, snails, that, have, gills, have, diversified, so, widely, over, geological, time, that, a, few, species, with, gills, can, be, found, on, land, and, numerous, species, with, lungs, can, be, found, in, freshwater, even, a, few, marine, species, have, lungs, snails, can, be, found, in, a, very, wide, range, of, environments, including, ditches, deserts, and, the, abyssal, depths, of, the, sea, although, land, snails, may, be, more, familiar, to, laymen, marine, snails, constitute, the, majority, of, snail, species, and, have, much, greater, diversity, and, a, greater, biomass, numerous, kinds, of, snail, can, also, be, found, in, fresh, water, most, snails, have, thousands, of, microscopic, tooth, like, structures, located, on, a, banded, ribbon, like, tongue, called, a, radula, the, radula, works, like, a, file, ripping, food, into, small, pieces, many, snails, are, herbivorous, eating, plants, or, rasping, algae, from, surfaces, with, their, radulae, though, a, few, land, species, and, many, marine, species, are, omnivores, or, predatory, carnivores, snails, cannot, absorb, colored, pigments, when, eating, paper, or, cardboard, so, their, feces, are, also, colored, several, species, of, the, genus, achatina, and, related, genera, are, known, as, giant, african, land, snails, some, grow, to, 15, in, 38, cm, from, snout, to, tail, and, weigh, 1, kg, 2, lb, the, largest, living, species, of, sea, snail, is, syrinx, aruanus, its, shell, can, measure, up, to, 90, cm, 35, in, in, length, and, the, whole, animal, with, the, shell, can, weigh, up, to, 18, kg, 40, lb, recently, the, smallest, land, snails, angustopila, dominikae, have, been, discovered, in, china, and, measure, 0, 86mm, long, the, largest, known, land, gastropod, is, the, african, giant, snail, achatina, achatina, the, largest, recorded, specimen, of, which, measured, 39, 3, centimetres, 15, 5, in, from, snout, to, tail, when, fully, extended, with, a, shell, length, of, 27, 3, cm, 10, 7, in, in, december, 1978, it, weighed, exactly, 900, g, about, 2, lb, named, gee, geronimo, this, snail, was, owned, by, christopher, hudson, 1955, 79, of, hove, east, sussex, uk, and, was, collected, in, sierra, leone, in, june, 1976, snails, are, protostomes, that, means, during, development, in, the, gastrulation, phase, the, blastopore, forms, the, mouth, first, cleavage, in, snails, is, spiral, holoblastic, patterning, in, spiral, holoblastic, cleavage, the, cleavage, plane, rotates, each, division, and, the, cell, divisions, are, complete, snails, do, not, undergo, metamorphosis, after, hatching, snails, hatch, in, the, form, of, small, adults, the, only, additional, development, they, will, undergo, is, to, consume, calcium, to, strengthen, their, shell, snails, can, be, male, female, hermaphroditic, or, parthenogenetic, so, there, are, many, different, systems, of, sexual, determination, snails, eating, habits, vary, widely, with, some, being, generalists, and, some, being, specialist, feeders, snails, feed, at, night, they, feed, primarily, on, decaying, organic, matter, their, diet, also, includes, fungi, lichens, green, foliage, worms, centipedes, insects, animal, feces, carrion, and, other, slugs, some, snails, feed, on, other, snails, too, gastropods, that, lack, a, conspicuous, shell, are, commonly, called, slugs, rather, than, snails, some, species, of, slug, have, a, maroon, brown, shell, some, have, only, an, internal, vestige, that, serves, mainly, as, a, calcium, lactate, repository, and, others, have, some, to, no, shell, at, all, other, than, that, there, is, little, morphological, difference, between, slugs, and, snails, there, are, however, important, differences, in, habitats, and, behavior, a, shell, less, animal, is, much, more, maneuverable, and, compressible, so, even, quite, large, land, slugs, can, take, advantage, of, habitats, or, retreats, with, very, little, space, retreats, that, would, be, inaccessible, to, a, similar, sized, snail, slugs, squeeze, themselves, into, confined, spaces, such, as, under, loose, bark, on, trees, or, under, stone, slabs, logs, or, wooden, boards, lying, on, the, ground, in, such, retreats, they, are, in, less, danger, from, either, predators, or, desiccation, those, are, often, suitable, places, for, laying, their, eggs, slugs, as, a, group, are, far, from, monophyletic, scientifically, speaking, slug, is, a, term, of, convenience, with, little, taxonomic, significance, the, reduction, or, loss, of, the, shell, has, evolved, many, times, independently, within, several, very, different, lineages, of, gastropods, the, various, taxa, of, land, and, sea, gastropods, with, slug, morphology, occur, within, numerous, higher, taxonomic, groups, of, shelled, species, such, independent, slug, taxa, are, not, in, general, closely, related, to, one, another, land, snails, are, known, as, an, agricultural, and, garden, pest, but, some, species, are, an, edible, delicacy, and, occasionally, household, pets, in, addition, their, mucus, can, also, be, used, for, skin, care, products, there, is, a, variety, of, snail, control, measures, that, gardeners, and, farmers, use, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, damage, to, valuable, plants, traditional, pesticides, are, still, used, as, are, many, less, toxic, control, options, such, as, concentrated, garlic, or, wormwood, solutions, copper, metal, is, also, a, snail, repellent, and, thus, a, copper, band, around, the, trunk, of, a, tree, will, prevent, snails, from, climbing, up, and, reaching, the, foliage, and, fruit, a, layer, of, a, dry, finely, ground, and, scratchy, substance, such, as, diatomaceous, earth, can, also, deter, snails, the, decollate, snail, rumina, decollata, will, capture, and, eat, garden, snails, and, because, of, this, it, has, sometimes, been, introduced, as, a, biological, pest, control, agent, however, this, is, not, without, problems, as, the, decollate, snail, is, just, as, likely, to, attack, and, devour, other, gastropods, that, may, represent, a, valuable, part, of, the, native, fauna, of, the, region, in, french, cuisine, edible, snails, are, served, for, instance, in, escargot, la, bourguignonne, the, practice, of, rearing, snails, for, food, is, known, as, heliciculture, for, purposes, of, cultivation, the, snails, are, kept, in, a, dark, place, in, a, wired, cage, with, dry, straw, or, dry, wood, coppiced, wine, grape, vines, are, often, used, for, this, purpose, during, the, rainy, period, the, snails, come, out, of, hibernation, and, release, most, of, their, mucus, onto, the, dry, wood, straw, the, snails, are, then, prepared, for, cooking, their, texture, when, cooked, is, slightly, chewy, and, tender, as, well, as, being, eaten, as, gourmet, food, several, species, of, land, snails, provide, an, easily, harvested, source, of, protein, to, many, people, in, poor, communities, around, the, world, many, land, snails, are, valuable, because, they, can, feed, on, a, wide, range, of, agricultural, wastes, such, as, shed, leaves, in, banana, plantations, in, some, countries, giant, african, land, snails, are, produced, commercially, for, food, land, snails, freshwater, snails, and, sea, snails, are, all, eaten, in, many, countries, in, certain, parts, of, the, world, snails, are, fried, for, example, in, indonesia, they, are, fried, as, satay, a, dish, known, as, sate, kakul, the, eggs, of, certain, snail, species, are, eaten, in, a, fashion, similar, to, the, way, caviar, is, eaten, in, bulgaria, snails, are, traditionally, cooked, in, an, oven, with, rice, or, fried, in, a, pan, with, vegetable, oil, and, red, paprika, powder, before, they, are, used, for, those, dishes, however, they, are, thoroughly, boiled, in, hot, water, for, up, to, 90, minutes, and, manually, extracted, from, their, shells, the, two, species, most, commonly, used, for, food, in, the, country, are, helix, lucorum, and, helix, pomatia, snails, and, slug, species, that, are, not, normally, eaten, in, certain, areas, have, occasionally, been, used, as, famine, food, in, historical, times, a, history, of, scotland, written, in, the, 1800s, recounts, a, description, of, various, snails, and, their, use, as, food, items, in, times, of, plague, snails, can, also, be, associated, with, parasitic, diseases, such, as, schistosomiasis, angiostrongyliasis, fasciolopsiasis, opisthorchiasis, fascioliasis, paragonimiasis, and, clonorchiasis, which, can, be, transmitted, to, humans, because, of, its, slowness, the, snail, has, traditionally, been, seen, as, a, symbol, of, laziness, in, christian, culture, it, has, been, used, as, a, symbol, of, the, deadly, sin, of, sloth, psalms, 58, 8, uses, snail, slime, as, a, metaphorical, punishment, in, mayan, mythology, the, snail, is, associated, with, sexual, desire, being, personified, by, the, god, uayeb, snails, were, widely, noted, and, used, in, divination, the, greek, poet, hesiod, wrote, that, snails, signified, the, time, to, harvest, by, climbing, the, stalks, while, the, aztec, moon, god, tecciztecatl, bore, a, snail, shell, on, his, back, this, symbolised, rebirth, the, snail, s, penchant, for, appearing, and, disappearing, was, analogised, with, the, moon, professor, ronald, chase, of, mcgill, university, in, montreal, has, suggested, the, ancient, myth, of, cupid, s, arrows, might, be, based, on, early, observations, of, the, love, dart, behavior, of, the, land, snail, species, cornu, aspersum, in, contemporary, speech, the, expression, a, snail, s, pace, is, often, used, to, describe, a, slow, inefficient, process, the, phrase, snail, mail, is, used, to, mean, regular, postal, service, delivery, of, paper, messages, as, opposed, to, the, delivery, of, email, which, can, be, virtually, instantaneous, in, medieval, and, renaissance, manuscripts, snails, are, depicted, as, a, comic, relief, due, to, the, similarity, between, the, armour, of, knights, and, the, shell, of, snails, keong, emas, javanese, and, indonesian, for, golden, snail, is, a, popular, javanese, folklore, about, a, princess, magically, transformed, and, contained, in, a, golden, snail, shell, the, folklore, is, a, part, of, popular, javanese, panji, cycle, telling, the, stories, about, the, prince, panji, asmoro, bangun, also, known, as, raden, inu, kertapati, and, his, consort, princess, dewi, sekartaji, also, known, as, dewi, chandra, kirana, certain, varieties, of, snails, notably, the, family, muricidae, produce, a, secretion, that, is, a, color, fast, natural, dye, the, ancient, tyrian, purple, was, made, in, this, way, as, were, other, purple, and, blue, dyes, the, extreme, expense, of, extracting, this, secretion, is, sufficient, quantities, limited, its, use, to, the, very, wealthy, it, is, such, dyes, as, these, that, led, to, certain, shades, of, purple, and, blue, being, associated, with, royalty, and, wealth, throughout, history, snails, have, been, kept, as, pets, there, are, many, famous, snails, such, as, lefty, born, jeremy, and, within, fiction, gary, and, brian, the, snail
