see, subgroups, of, the, order, coleoptera, beetles, are, insects, that, form, the, order, coleoptera, k, o, l, i, p, t, r, in, the, superorder, holometabola, their, front, pair, of, wings, are, hardened, into, wing, cases, elytra, distinguishing, them, from, most, other, insects, the, coleoptera, with, about, 400, 000, described, species, is, the, largest, of, all, orders, constituting, almost, 40, of, described, insects, and, 25, of, all, known, animal, species, new, species, are, discovered, frequently, with, estimates, suggesting, that, there, are, between, 0, 9, and, 2, 1, million, total, species, found, in, almost, every, habitat, except, the, sea, and, the, polar, regions, they, interact, with, their, ecosystems, in, several, ways, beetles, often, feed, on, plants, and, fungi, break, down, animal, and, plant, debris, and, eat, other, invertebrates, some, species, are, serious, agricultural, pests, such, as, the, colorado, potato, beetle, while, others, such, as, coccinellidae, ladybirds, or, ladybugs, eat, aphids, scale, insects, thrips, and, other, plant, sucking, insects, that, damage, crops, some, others, also, have, unusual, characteristics, such, as, fireflies, which, use, a, light, emitting, organ, for, mating, and, communication, purposes, beetles, typically, have, a, particularly, hard, exoskeleton, including, the, elytra, though, some, such, as, the, rove, beetles, have, very, short, elytra, while, blister, beetles, have, softer, elytra, the, general, anatomy, of, a, beetle, is, quite, uniform, and, typical, of, insects, although, there, are, several, examples, of, novelty, such, as, adaptations, in, water, beetles, which, trap, air, bubbles, under, the, elytra, for, use, while, diving, beetles, are, holometabolans, which, means, that, they, undergo, complete, metamorphosis, with, a, series, of, conspicuous, and, relatively, abrupt, changes, in, body, structure, between, hatching, and, becoming, adult, after, a, relatively, immobile, pupal, stage, some, such, as, stag, beetles, have, a, marked, sexual, dimorphism, the, males, possessing, enormously, enlarged, mandibles, which, they, use, to, fight, other, males, many, beetles, are, aposematic, with, bright, colors, and, patterns, warning, of, their, toxicity, while, others, are, harmless, batesian, mimics, of, such, insects, many, beetles, including, those, that, live, in, sandy, places, have, effective, camouflage, beetles, are, prominent, in, human, culture, from, the, sacred, scarabs, of, ancient, egypt, to, beetlewing, art, and, use, as, pets, or, fighting, insects, for, entertainment, and, gambling, many, beetle, groups, are, brightly, and, attractively, colored, making, them, objects, of, collection, and, decorative, displays, over, 300, species, are, used, as, food, mostly, as, larvae, species, widely, consumed, include, mealworms, and, rhinoceros, beetle, larvae, however, the, major, impact, of, beetles, on, human, life, is, as, agricultural, forestry, and, horticultural, pests, serious, pest, species, include, the, boll, weevil, of, cotton, the, colorado, potato, beetle, the, coconut, hispine, beetle, the, mountain, pine, beetle, and, many, others, most, beetles, however, do, not, cause, economic, damage, and, some, such, as, numerous, species, of, lady, beetles, are, beneficial, by, helping, to, control, insect, pests, the, name, of, the, taxonomic, order, coleoptera, comes, from, the, greek, koleopteros, given, to, the, group, by, aristotle, for, their, elytra, hardened, shield, like, forewings, from, koleos, sheath, and, pteron, wing, the, english, name, beetle, comes, from, the, old, english, word, bitela, little, biter, related, to, b, tan, to, bite, leading, to, middle, english, betylle, another, old, english, name, for, beetle, is, eafor, chafer, used, in, names, such, as, cockchafer, from, the, proto, germanic, kebr, beetle, compare, german, k, fer, dutch, kever, afrikaans, kewer, beetles, are, by, far, the, largest, order, of, insects, the, roughly, 400, 000, species, make, up, about, 40, of, all, insect, species, so, far, described, and, about, 25, of, all, animal, species, a, 2015, study, provided, four, independent, estimates, of, the, total, number, of, beetle, species, giving, a, mean, estimate, of, some, 1, 5, million, with, a, surprisingly, narrow, range, spanning, all, four, estimates, from, a, minimum, of, 0, 9, to, a, maximum, of, 2, 1, million, beetle, species, the, four, estimates, made, use, of, host, specificity, relationships, 1, 5, to, 1, 9, million, ratios, with, other, taxa, 0, 9, to, 1, 2, million, plant, beetle, ratios, 1, 2, to, 1, 3, and, extrapolations, based, on, body, size, by, year, of, description, 1, 7, to, 2, 1, million, this, immense, diversity, led, the, evolutionary, biologist, j, b, s, haldane, to, quip, when, some, theologians, asked, him, what, could, be, inferred, about, the, mind, of, the, christian, god, from, the, works, of, his, creation, an, inordinate, fondness, for, beetles, however, the, ranking, of, beetles, as, most, diverse, has, been, challenged, multiple, studies, posit, that, diptera, flies, and, or, hymenoptera, sawflies, wasps, ants, and, bees, may, have, more, species, beetles, are, found, in, nearly, all, habitats, including, freshwater, and, coastal, habitats, wherever, vegetative, foliage, is, found, from, trees, and, their, bark, to, flowers, leaves, and, underground, near, roots, even, inside, plants, in, galls, in, every, plant, tissue, including, dead, or, decaying, ones, tropical, forest, canopies, have, a, large, and, diverse, fauna, of, beetles, including, carabidae, chrysomelidae, and, scarabaeidae, the, heaviest, beetle, indeed, the, heaviest, insect, stage, is, the, larva, of, the, goliath, beetle, goliathus, goliatus, which, can, attain, a, mass, of, at, least, 115, g, 4, 1, oz, and, a, length, of, 11, 5, cm, 4, 5, in, adult, male, goliath, beetles, are, the, heaviest, beetle, in, its, adult, stage, weighing, 70, 100, g, 2, 5, 3, 5, oz, and, measuring, up, to, 11, cm, 4, 3, in, adult, elephant, beetles, megasoma, elephas, and, megasoma, actaeon, often, reach, 50, g, 1, 8, oz, and, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, the, longest, beetle, is, the, hercules, beetle, dynastes, hercules, with, a, maximum, overall, length, of, at, least, 16, 7, cm, 6, 6, in, including, the, very, long, pronotal, horn, the, smallest, recorded, beetle, and, the, smallest, free, living, insect, as, of, 2015, is, the, featherwing, beetle, scydosella, musawasensis, which, may, measure, as, little, as, 325, m, in, length, the, oldest, known, beetle, is, coleopsis, from, the, earliest, permian, asselian, of, germany, around, 295, million, years, ago, early, beetles, from, the, permian, which, are, collectively, grouped, into, the, protocoleoptera, are, thought, to, have, been, xylophagous, wood, eating, and, wood, boring, fossils, from, this, time, have, been, found, in, siberia, and, europe, for, instance, in, the, red, slate, fossil, beds, of, niedermoschel, near, mainz, germany, further, fossils, have, been, found, in, obora, czech, republic, and, tshekarda, in, the, ural, mountains, russia, however, there, are, only, a, few, fossils, from, north, america, before, the, middle, permian, although, both, asia, and, north, america, had, been, united, to, euramerica, the, first, discoveries, from, north, america, made, in, the, wellington, formation, of, oklahoma, were, published, in, 2005, and, 2008, the, earliest, members, of, modern, beetle, lineages, appeared, during, the, late, permian, in, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, at, the, end, of, the, permian, most, protocoleopteran, lineages, became, extinct, beetle, diversity, did, not, recover, to, pre, extinction, levels, until, the, middle, triassic, during, the, jurassic, 210, to, 145, mya, there, was, a, dramatic, increase, in, the, diversity, of, beetle, families, including, the, development, and, growth, of, carnivorous, and, herbivorous, species, the, chrysomeloidea, diversified, around, the, same, time, feeding, on, a, wide, array, of, plant, hosts, from, cycads, and, conifers, to, angiosperms, close, to, the, upper, jurassic, the, cupedidae, decreased, but, the, diversity, of, the, early, plant, eating, species, increased, most, recent, plant, eating, beetles, feed, on, flowering, plants, or, angiosperms, whose, success, contributed, to, a, doubling, of, plant, eating, species, during, the, middle, jurassic, however, the, increase, of, the, number, of, beetle, families, during, the, cretaceous, does, not, correlate, with, the, increase, of, the, number, of, angiosperm, species, around, the, same, time, numerous, primitive, weevils, e, g, curculionoidea, and, click, beetles, e, g, elateroidea, appeared, the, first, jewel, beetles, e, g, buprestidae, are, present, but, they, remained, rare, until, the, cretaceous, the, first, scarab, beetles, were, not, coprophagous, but, presumably, fed, on, rotting, wood, with, the, help, of, fungus, they, are, an, early, example, of, a, mutualistic, relationship, there, are, more, than, 150, important, fossil, sites, from, the, jurassic, the, majority, in, eastern, europe, and, north, asia, outstanding, sites, include, solnhofen, in, upper, bavaria, germany, karatau, in, south, kazakhstan, the, yixian, formation, in, liaoning, north, china, as, well, as, the, jiulongshan, formation, and, further, fossil, sites, in, mongolia, in, north, america, there, are, only, a, few, sites, with, fossil, records, of, insects, from, the, jurassic, namely, the, shell, limestone, deposits, in, the, hartford, basin, the, deerfield, basin, and, the, newark, basin, the, cretaceous, saw, the, fragmenting, of, the, southern, landmass, with, the, opening, of, the, southern, atlantic, ocean, and, the, isolation, of, new, zealand, while, south, america, antarctica, and, australia, grew, more, distant, the, diversity, of, cupedidae, and, archostemata, decreased, considerably, predatory, ground, beetles, carabidae, and, rove, beetles, staphylinidae, began, to, distribute, into, different, patterns, the, carabidae, predominantly, occurred, in, the, warm, regions, while, the, staphylinidae, and, click, beetles, elateridae, preferred, temperate, climates, likewise, predatory, species, of, cleroidea, and, cucujoidea, hunted, their, prey, under, the, bark, of, trees, together, with, the, jewel, beetles, buprestidae, the, diversity, of, jewel, beetles, increased, rapidly, as, they, were, the, primary, consumers, of, wood, while, longhorn, beetles, cerambycidae, were, rather, rare, their, diversity, increased, only, towards, the, end, of, the, upper, cretaceous, the, first, coprophagous, beetles, are, from, the, upper, cretaceous, and, may, have, lived, on, the, excrement, of, herbivorous, dinosaurs, the, first, species, where, both, larvae, and, adults, are, adapted, to, an, aquatic, lifestyle, are, found, whirligig, beetles, gyrinidae, were, moderately, diverse, although, other, early, beetles, e, g, dytiscidae, were, less, with, the, most, widespread, being, the, species, of, coptoclavidae, which, preyed, on, aquatic, fly, larvae, a, 2020, review, of, the, palaeoecological, interpretations, of, fossil, beetles, from, cretaceous, ambers, has, suggested, that, saproxylicity, was, the, most, common, feeding, strategy, with, fungivorous, species, in, particular, appearing, to, dominate, many, fossil, sites, worldwide, contain, beetles, from, the, cretaceous, most, are, in, europe, and, asia, and, belong, to, the, temperate, climate, zone, during, the, cretaceous, lower, cretaceous, sites, include, the, crato, fossil, beds, in, the, araripe, basin, in, the, cear, north, brazil, as, well, as, overlying, santana, formation, the, latter, was, near, the, equator, at, that, time, in, spain, important, sites, are, near, montsec, and, las, hoyas, in, australia, the, koonwarra, fossil, beds, of, the, korumburra, group, south, gippsland, victoria, are, noteworthy, major, sites, from, the, upper, cretaceous, include, kzyl, dzhar, in, south, kazakhstan, and, arkagala, in, russia, beetle, fossils, are, abundant, in, the, cenozoic, by, the, quaternary, up, to, 1, 6, mya, fossil, species, are, identical, to, living, ones, while, from, the, late, miocene, 5, 7, mya, the, fossils, are, still, so, close, to, modern, forms, that, they, are, most, likely, the, ancestors, of, living, species, the, large, oscillations, in, climate, during, the, quaternary, caused, beetles, to, change, their, geographic, distributions, so, much, that, current, location, gives, little, clue, to, the, biogeographical, history, of, a, species, it, is, evident, that, geographic, isolation, of, populations, must, often, have, been, broken, as, insects, moved, under, the, influence, of, changing, climate, causing, mixing, of, gene, pools, rapid, evolution, and, extinctions, especially, in, middle, latitudes, the, very, large, number, of, beetle, species, poses, special, problems, for, classification, some, families, contain, tens, of, thousands, of, species, and, need, to, be, divided, into, subfamilies, and, tribes, polyphaga, is, the, largest, suborder, containing, more, than, 300, 000, described, species, in, more, than, 170, families, including, rove, beetles, staphylinidae, scarab, beetles, scarabaeidae, blister, beetles, meloidae, stag, beetles, lucanidae, and, true, weevils, curculionidae, these, polyphagan, beetle, groups, can, be, identified, by, the, presence, of, cervical, sclerites, hardened, parts, of, the, head, used, as, points, of, attachment, for, muscles, absent, in, the, other, suborders, adephaga, contains, about, 10, families, of, largely, predatory, beetles, includes, ground, beetles, carabidae, water, beetles, dytiscidae, and, whirligig, beetles, gyrinidae, in, these, insects, the, testes, are, tubular, and, the, first, abdominal, sternum, a, plate, of, the, exoskeleton, is, divided, by, the, hind, coxae, the, basal, joints, of, the, beetle, s, legs, archostemata, contains, four, families, of, mainly, wood, eating, beetles, including, reticulated, beetles, cupedidae, and, the, telephone, pole, beetle, the, archostemata, have, an, exposed, plate, called, the, metatrochantin, in, front, of, the, basal, segment, or, coxa, of, the, hind, leg, myxophaga, contains, about, 65, described, species, in, four, families, mostly, very, small, including, hydroscaphidae, and, the, genus, sphaerius, the, myxophagan, beetles, are, small, and, mostly, alga, feeders, their, mouthparts, are, characteristic, in, lacking, galeae, and, having, a, mobile, tooth, on, their, left, mandible, the, consistency, of, beetle, morphology, in, particular, their, possession, of, elytra, has, long, suggested, that, coleoptera, is, monophyletic, though, there, have, been, doubts, about, the, arrangement, of, the, suborders, namely, the, adephaga, archostemata, myxophaga, and, polyphaga, within, that, clade, the, twisted, wing, parasites, strepsiptera, are, thought, to, be, a, sister, group, to, the, beetles, having, split, from, them, in, the, early, permian, molecular, phylogenetic, analysis, confirms, that, the, coleoptera, are, monophyletic, duane, mckenna, et, al, 2015, used, eight, nuclear, genes, for, 367, species, from, 172, of, 183, coleopteran, families, they, split, the, adephaga, into, 2, clades, hydradephaga, and, geadephaga, broke, up, the, cucujoidea, into, 3, clades, and, placed, the,

hard, forewings, elytra, not, usable, for, flying, almost, all, beetles, have, mandibles, that, move, in, a, horizontal, plane, the, mouthparts, are, rarely, suctorial, though, they, are, sometimes, reduced, the, maxillae, always, bear, palps, the, antennae, usually, have, 11, or, fewer, segments, except, in, some, groups, like, the, cerambycidae, longhorn, beetles, and, the, rhipiceridae, cicada, parasite, beetles, the, coxae, of, the, legs, are, usually, located, recessed, within, a, coxal, cavity, the, genitalic, structures, are, telescoped, into, the, last, abdominal, segment, in, all, extant, beetles, beetle, larvae, can, often, be, confused, with, those, of, other, holometabolan, groups, the, beetle, s, exoskeleton, is, made, up, of, numerous, plates, called, sclerites, separated, by, thin, sutures, this, design, provides, armored, defenses, while, maintaining, flexibility, the, general, anatomy, of, a, beetle, is, quite, uniform, although, specific, organs, and, appendages, vary, greatly, in, appearance, and, function, between, the, many, families, in, the, order, like, all, insects, beetles, bodies, are, divided, into, three, sections, the, head, the, thorax, and, the, abdomen, because, there, are, so, many, species, identification, is, quite, difficult, and, relies, on, attributes, including, the, shape, of, the, antennae, the, tarsal, formulae, and, shapes, of, these, small, segments, on, the, legs, the, mouthparts, and, the, ventral, plates, sterna, pleura, coxae, in, many, species, accurate, identification, can, only, be, made, by, examination, of, the, unique, male, genitalic, structures, the, head, having, mouthparts, projecting, forward, or, sometimes, downturned, is, usually, heavily, sclerotized, and, is, sometimes, very, large, the, eyes, are, compound, and, may, display, remarkable, adaptability, as, in, the, case, of, the, aquatic, whirligig, beetles, gyrinidae, where, they, are, split, to, allow, a, view, both, above, and, below, the, waterline, a, few, longhorn, beetles, cerambycidae, and, weevils, as, well, as, some, fireflies, rhagophthalmidae, have, divided, eyes, while, many, have, eyes, that, are, notched, and, a, few, have, ocelli, small, simple, eyes, usually, farther, back, on, the, head, on, the, vertex, these, are, more, common, in, larvae, than, in, adults, the, anatomical, organization, of, the, compound, eyes, may, be, modified, and, depends, on, whether, a, species, is, primarily, crepuscular, or, diurnally, or, nocturnally, active, ocelli, are, found, in, the, adult, carpet, beetle, as, a, single, central, ocellus, in, dermestidae, some, rove, beetles, omaliinae, and, the, derodontidae, beetle, antennae, are, primarily, organs, of, sensory, perception, and, can, detect, motion, odor, and, chemical, substances, but, may, also, be, used, to, physically, feel, a, beetle, s, environment, beetle, families, may, use, antennae, in, different, ways, for, example, when, moving, quickly, tiger, beetles, may, not, be, able, to, see, very, well, and, instead, hold, their, antennae, rigidly, in, front, of, them, in, order, to, avoid, obstacles, certain, cerambycidae, use, antennae, to, balance, and, blister, beetles, may, use, them, for, grasping, some, aquatic, beetle, species, may, use, antennae, for, gathering, air, and, passing, it, under, the, body, whilst, submerged, equally, some, families, use, antennae, during, mating, and, a, few, species, use, them, for, defense, in, the, cerambycid, onychocerus, albitarsis, the, antennae, have, venom, injecting, structures, used, in, defense, which, is, unique, among, arthropods, antennae, vary, greatly, in, form, sometimes, between, the, sexes, but, are, often, similar, within, any, given, family, antennae, may, be, clubbed, threadlike, angled, shaped, like, a, string, of, beads, comb, like, either, on, one, side, or, both, bipectinate, or, toothed, the, physical, variation, of, antennae, is, important, for, the, identification, of, many, beetle, groups, the, curculionidae, have, elbowed, or, geniculate, antennae, feather, like, flabellate, antennae, are, a, restricted, form, found, in, the, rhipiceridae, and, a, few, other, families, the, silphidae, have, a, capitate, antennae, with, a, spherical, head, at, the, tip, the, scarabaeidae, typically, have, lamellate, antennae, with, the, terminal, segments, extended, into, long, flat, structures, stacked, together, the, carabidae, typically, have, thread, like, antennae, the, antennae, arises, between, the, eye, and, the, mandibles, and, in, the, tenebrionidae, the, antennae, rise, in, front, of, a, notch, that, breaks, the, usually, circular, outline, of, the, compound, eye, they, are, segmented, and, usually, consist, of, 11, parts, the, first, part, is, called, the, scape, and, the, second, part, is, the, pedicel, the, other, segments, are, jointly, called, the, flagellum, beetles, have, mouthparts, like, those, of, grasshoppers, the, mandibles, appear, as, large, pincers, on, the, front, of, some, beetles, the, mandibles, are, a, pair, of, hard, often, tooth, like, structures, that, move, horizontally, to, grasp, crush, or, cut, food, or, enemies, see, defence, below, two, pairs, of, finger, like, appendages, the, maxillary, and, labial, palpi, are, found, around, the, mouth, in, most, beetles, serving, to, move, food, into, the, mouth, in, many, species, the, mandibles, are, sexually, dimorphic, with, those, of, the, males, enlarged, enormously, compared, with, those, of, females, of, the, same, species, the, thorax, is, segmented, into, the, two, discernible, parts, the, pro, and, pterothorax, the, pterothorax, is, the, fused, meso, and, metathorax, which, are, commonly, separated, in, other, insect, species, although, flexibly, articulate, from, the, prothorax, when, viewed, from, below, the, thorax, is, that, part, from, which, all, three, pairs, of, legs, and, both, pairs, of, wings, arise, the, abdomen, is, everything, posterior, to, the, thorax, when, viewed, from, above, most, beetles, appear, to, have, three, clear, sections, but, this, is, deceptive, on, the, beetle, s, upper, surface, the, middle, section, is, a, hard, plate, called, the, pronotum, which, is, only, the, front, part, of, the, thorax, the, back, part, of, the, thorax, is, concealed, by, the, beetle, s, wings, this, further, segmentation, is, usually, best, seen, on, the, abdomen, the, multisegmented, legs, end, in, two, to, five, small, segments, called, tarsi, like, many, other, insect, orders, beetles, have, claws, usually, one, pair, on, the, end, of, the, last, tarsal, segment, of, each, leg, while, most, beetles, use, their, legs, for, walking, legs, have, been, variously, adapted, for, other, uses, aquatic, beetles, including, the, dytiscidae, diving, beetles, haliplidae, and, many, species, of, hydrophilidae, the, legs, often, the, last, pair, are, modified, for, swimming, typically, with, rows, of, long, hairs, male, diving, beetles, have, suctorial, cups, on, their, forelegs, that, they, use, to, grasp, females, other, beetles, have, fossorial, legs, widened, and, often, spined, for, digging, species, with, such, adaptations, are, found, among, the, scarabs, ground, beetles, and, clown, beetles, histeridae, the, hind, legs, of, some, beetles, such, as, flea, beetles, within, chrysomelidae, and, flea, weevils, within, curculionidae, have, enlarged, femurs, that, help, them, leap, the, forewings, of, beetles, are, not, used, for, flight, but, form, elytra, which, cover, the, hind, part, of, the, body, and, protect, the, hindwings, the, elytra, are, usually, hard, shell, like, structures, which, must, be, raised, to, allow, the, hindwings, to, move, for, flight, however, in, the, soldier, beetles, cantharidae, the, elytra, are, soft, earning, this, family, the, name, of, leatherwings, other, soft, wing, beetles, include, the, net, winged, beetle, calopteron, discrepans, which, has, brittle, wings, that, rupture, easily, in, order, to, release, chemicals, for, defense, beetles, flight, wings, are, crossed, with, veins, and, are, folded, after, landing, often, along, these, veins, and, stored, below, the, elytra, a, fold, jugum, of, the, membrane, at, the, base, of, each, wing, is, characteristic, some, beetles, have, lost, the, ability, to, fly, these, include, some, ground, beetles, carabidae, and, some, true, weevils, curculionidae, as, well, as, desert, and, cave, dwelling, species, of, other, families, many, have, the, two, elytra, fused, together, forming, a, solid, shield, over, the, abdomen, in, a, few, families, both, the, ability, to, fly, and, the, elytra, have, been, lost, as, in, the, glow, worms, phengodidae, where, the, females, resemble, larvae, throughout, their, lives, the, presence, of, elytra, and, wings, does, not, always, indicate, that, the, beetle, will, fly, for, example, the, tansy, beetle, walks, between, habitats, despite, being, physically, capable, of, flight, the, abdomen, is, the, section, behind, the, metathorax, made, up, of, a, series, of, rings, each, with, a, hole, for, breathing, and, respiration, called, a, spiracle, composing, three, different, segmented, sclerites, the, tergum, pleura, and, the, sternum, the, tergum, in, almost, all, species, is, membranous, or, usually, soft, and, concealed, by, the, wings, and, elytra, when, not, in, flight, the, pleura, are, usually, small, or, hidden, in, some, species, with, each, pleuron, having, a, single, spiracle, the, sternum, is, the, most, widely, visible, part, of, the, abdomen, being, a, more, or, less, sclerotized, segment, the, abdomen, itself, does, not, have, any, appendages, but, some, for, example, mordellidae, have, articulating, sternal, lobes, the, digestive, system, of, beetles, is, primarily, adapted, for, a, herbivorous, diet, digestion, takes, place, mostly, in, the, anterior, midgut, although, in, predatory, groups, like, the, carabidae, most, digestion, occurs, in, the, crop, by, means, of, midgut, enzymes, in, the, elateridae, the, larvae, are, liquid, feeders, that, extraorally, digest, their, food, by, secreting, enzymes, the, alimentary, canal, basically, consists, of, a, short, narrow, pharynx, a, widened, expansion, the, crop, and, a, poorly, developed, gizzard, this, is, followed, by, the, midgut, that, varies, in, dimensions, between, species, with, a, large, amount, of, cecum, and, the, hindgut, with, varying, lengths, there, are, typically, four, to, six, malpighian, tubules, the, nervous, system, in, beetles, contains, all, the, types, found, in, insects, varying, between, different, species, from, three, thoracic, and, seven, or, eight, abdominal, ganglia, which, can, be, distinguished, to, that, in, which, all, the, thoracic, and, abdominal, ganglia, are, fused, to, form, a, composite, structure, like, most, insects, beetles, inhale, air, for, the, oxygen, it, contains, and, exhale, carbon, dioxide, via, a, tracheal, system, air, enters, the, body, through, spiracles, and, circulates, within, the, haemocoel, in, a, system, of, tracheae, and, tracheoles, through, whose, walls, the, gases, can, diffuse, diving, beetles, such, as, the, dytiscidae, carry, a, bubble, of, air, with, them, when, they, dive, such, a, bubble, may, be, contained, under, the, elytra, or, against, the, body, by, specialized, hydrophobic, hairs, the, bubble, covers, at, least, some, of, the, spiracles, permitting, air, to, enter, the, tracheae, the, function, of, the, bubble, is, not, only, to, contain, a, store, of, air, but, to, act, as, a, physical, gill, the, air, that, it, traps, is, in, contact, with, oxygenated, water, so, as, the, animal, s, consumption, depletes, the, oxygen, in, the, bubble, more, oxygen, can, diffuse, in, to, replenish, it, carbon, dioxide, is, more, soluble, in, water, than, either, oxygen, or, nitrogen, so, it, readily, diffuses, out, faster, than, in, nitrogen, is, the, most, plentiful, gas, in, the, bubble, and, the, least, soluble, so, it, constitutes, a, relatively, static, component, of, the, bubble, and, acts, as, a, stable, medium, for, respiratory, gases, to, accumulate, in, and, pass, through, occasional, visits, to, the, surface, are, sufficient, for, the, beetle, to, re, establish, the, constitution, of, the, bubble, like, other, insects, beetles, have, open, circulatory, systems, based, on, hemolymph, rather, than, blood, as, in, other, insects, a, segmented, tube, like, heart, is, attached, to, the, dorsal, wall, of, the, hemocoel, it, has, paired, inlets, or, ostia, at, intervals, down, its, length, and, circulates, the, hemolymph, from, the, main, cavity, of, the, haemocoel, and, out, through, the, anterior, cavity, in, the, head, different, glands, are, specialized, for, different, pheromones, to, attract, mates, pheromones, from, species, of, rutelinae, are, produced, from, epithelial, cells, lining, the, inner, surface, of, the, apical, abdominal, segments, amino, acid, based, pheromones, of, melolonthinae, are, produced, from, eversible, glands, on, the, abdominal, apex, other, species, produce, different, types, of, pheromones, dermestids, produce, esters, and, species, of, elateridae, produce, fatty, acid, derived, aldehydes, and, acetates, to, attract, a, mate, fireflies, lampyridae, use, modified, fat, body, cells, with, transparent, surfaces, backed, with, reflective, uric, acid, crystals, to, produce, light, by, bioluminescence, light, production, is, highly, efficient, by, oxidation, of, luciferin, catalyzed, by, enzymes, luciferases, in, the, presence, of, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, and, oxygen, producing, oxyluciferin, carbon, dioxide, and, light, tympanal, organs, or, hearing, organs, consist, of, a, membrane, tympanum, stretched, across, a, frame, backed, by, an, air, sac, and, associated, sensory, neurons, are, found, in, two, families, several, species, of, the, genus, cicindela, carabidae, have, hearing, organs, on, the, dorsal, surfaces, of, their, first, abdominal, segments, beneath, the, wings, two, tribes, in, the, dynastinae, within, the, scarabaeidae, have, hearing, organs, just, beneath, their, pronotal, shields, or, neck, membranes, both, families, are, sensitive, to, ultrasonic, frequencies, with, strong, evidence, indicating, they, function, to, detect, the, presence, of, bats, by, their, ultrasonic, echolocation, beetles, are, members, of, the, superorder, holometabola, and, accordingly, most, of, them, undergo, complete, metamorphosis, the, typical, form, of, metamorphosis, in, beetles, passes, through, four, main, stages, the, egg, the, larva, the, pupa, and, the, imago, or, adult, the, larvae, are, commonly, called, grubs, and, the, pupa, sometimes, is, called, the, chrysalis, in, some, species, the, pupa, may, be, enclosed, in, a, cocoon, constructed, by, the, larva, towards, the, end, of, its, final, instar, some, beetles, such, as, typical, members, of, the, families, meloidae, and, rhipiphoridae, go, further, undergoing, hypermetamorphosis, in, which, the, first, instar, takes, the, form, of, a, triungulin, some, beetles, have, intricate, mating, behaviour, pheromone, communication, is, often, important, in, locating, a, mate, different, species, use, different, pheromones, scarab, beetles, such, as, the, rutelinae, use, pheromones, derived, from, fatty, acid, synthesis, and, others, use, pheromones, from, organic, compounds, while, other, scarabs, such, as, the, melolonthinae, use, amino, acids, and, terpenoids, another, way, beetles, find, mates, is, seen, in, the, fireflies, lampyridae, which, are, bioluminescent, with, abdominal, light, producing, organs, the, males, and, females, engage, in, a, complex, dialog, before, mating, each, species, has, a, unique, combination, of, flight, patterns, duration, composition, and, intensity, of, the, light, produced, before, mating, males, and, females, may, stridulate, or, vibrate, the, objects, they, are, on, in, the, meloidae, the, male, climbs, onto, the, dorsum, of, the, female, and, strokes, his, antennae, on, her, head, palps, and, antennae, in, eupompha, the, male, draws, his, antennae, along, his, longitudinal, vertex, they, may, not, mate, at, all, if, they, do, not, perform, the, precopulatory, ritual, this, mating, behavior, may, be, different, amongst, dispersed, populations, of, the, same, species, for, example, the, mating, of, a, russian, population, of, tansy, beetle, chrysolina, graminis, is, preceded, by, an, elaborate, ritual, involving, the, male, tapping, the, female, s, eyes, pronotum, and, antennae, with, its, antennae, which, is, not, evident, in, the, population, of, this, species, in, the, united, kingdom, in, another, example, the, intromittent, organ, of, male, thistle, tortoise, beetles, is, a, long, tube, like, structure, called, the, flagellum, which, is, thin, and, curved, when, not, in, use, the, flagellum, is, stored, inside, the, abdomen, of, the, male, and, can, extend, out, to, be, longer, than, the, male, when, needed, during, mating, this, organ, bends, to, the, complex, shape, of, the, female, reproductive, organ, which, includes, a, coiled, duct, that, the, male, must, penetrate, with, the, organ, furthermore, these, physical, properties, of, the, thistle, tortioise, beetle, have, been, studied, because, the, ability, of, a, thin, flexible, structure, to, harden, without, buckling, or, rupturing, is, mechanically, challenging, and, may, have, important, implications, for, the, development, of, microscopic, catheters, in, modern, medicine, competition, can, play, a, part, in, the, mating, rituals, of, species, such, as, burying, beetles, nicrophorus, the, insects, fighting, to, determine, which, can, mate, many, male, beetles, are, territorial, and, fiercely, defend, their, territories, from, intruding, males, in, such, species, the, male, often, has, horns, on, the, head, or, thorax, making, its, body, length, greater, than, that, of, a, female, copulation, is, generally, quick, but, in, some, cases, lasts, for, several, hours, during, copulation, sperm, cells, are, transferred, to, the, female, to, fertilize, the, egg, essentially, all, beetles, lay, eggs, though, some, myrmecophilous, aleocharinae, and, some, chrysomelinae, which, live, in, mountains, or, the, subarctic, are, ovoviviparous, laying, eggs, which, hatch, almost, immediately, beetle, eggs, generally, have, smooth, surfaces, and, are, soft, though, the, cupedidae, have, hard, eggs, eggs, vary, widely, between, species, the, eggs, tend, to, be, small, in, species, with, many, instars, larval, stages, and, in, those, that, lay, large, numbers, of, eggs, a, female, may, lay, from, several, dozen, to, several, thousand, eggs, during, her, lifetime, depending, on, the, extent, of, parental, care, this, ranges, from, the, simple, laying, of, eggs, under, a, leaf, to, the, parental, care, provided, by, scarab, beetles, which, house, feed, and, protect, their, young, the, attelabidae, roll, leaves, and, lay, their, eggs, inside, the, roll, for, protection, the, larva, is, usually, the, principal, feeding, stage, of, the, beetle, life, cycle, larvae, tend, to, feed, voraciously, once, they, emerge, from, their, eggs, some, feed, externally, on, plants, such, as, those, of, certain, leaf, beetles, while, others, feed, within, their, food, sources, examples, of, internal, feeders, are, most, buprestidae, and, longhorn, beetles, the, larvae, of, many, beetle, families, are, predatory, like, the, adults, ground, beetles, ladybirds, rove, beetles, the, larval, period, varies, between, species, but, can, be, as, long, as, several, years, the, larvae, of, skin, beetles, undergo, a, degree, of, reversed, development, when, starved, and, later, grow, back, to, the, previously, attained, level, of, maturity, the, cycle, can, be, repeated, many, times, see, biological, immortality, larval, morphology, is, highly, varied, amongst, species, with, well, developed, and, sclerotized, heads, distinguishable, thoracic, and, abdominal, segments, usually, the, tenth, though, sometimes, the, eighth, or, ninth, beetle, larvae, can, be, differentiated, from, other, insect, larvae, by, their, hardened, often, darkened, heads, the, presence, of, chewing, mouthparts, and, spiracles, along, the, sides, of, their, bodies, like, adult, beetles, the, larvae, are, varied, in, appearance, particularly, between, beetle, families, beetles, with, somewhat, flattened, highly, mobile, larvae, include, the, ground, beetles, and, rove, beetles, their, larvae, are, described, as, campodeiform, some, beetle, larvae, resemble, hardened, worms, with, dark, head, capsules, and, minute, legs, these, are, elateriform, larvae, and, are, found, in, the, click, beetle, elateridae, and, darkling, beetle, tenebrionidae, families, some, elateriform, larvae, of, click, beetles, are, known, as, wireworms, beetles, in, the, scarabaeoidea, have, short, thick, larvae, described, as, scarabaeiform, more, commonly, known, as, grubs, all, beetle, larvae, go, through, several, instars, which, are, the, developmental, stages, between, each, moult, in, many, species, the, larvae, simply, increase, in, size, with, each, successive, instar, as, more, food, is, consumed, in, some, cases, however, more, dramatic, changes, occur, among, certain, beetle, families, or, genera, particularly, those, that, exhibit, parasitic, lifestyles, the, first, instar, the, planidium, is, highly, mobile, to, search, out, a, host, while, the, following, instars, are, more, sedentary, and, remain, on, or, within, their, host, this, is, known, as, hypermetamorphosis, it, occurs, in, the, meloidae, micromalthidae, and, ripiphoridae, the, blister, beetle, epicauta, vittata, meloidae, for, example, has, three, distinct, larval, stages, its, first, stage, the, triungulin, has, longer, legs, to, go, in, search, of, the, eggs, of, grasshoppers, after, feeding, for, a, week, it, moults, to, the, second, stage, called, the, caraboid, stage, which, resembles, the, larva, of, a, carabid, beetle, in, another, week, it, moults, and, assumes, the, appearance, of, a, scarabaeid, larva, the, scarabaeidoid, stage, its, penultimate, larval, stage, is, the, pseudo, pupa, or, the, coarcate, larva, which, will, overwinter, and, pupate, until, the, next, spring, the, larval, period, can, vary, widely, a, fungus, feeding, staphylinid, phanerota, fasciata, undergoes, three, moults, in, 3, 2, days, at, room, temperature, while, anisotoma, sp, leiodidae, completes, its, larval, stage, in, the, fruiting, body, of, slime, mold, in, 2, days, and, possibly, represents, the, fastest, growing, beetles, dermestid, beetles, trogoderma, inclusum, can, remain, in, an, extended, larval, state, under, unfavourable, conditions, even, reducing, their, size, between, moults, a, larva, is, reported, to, have, survived, for, 3, 5, years, in, an, enclosed, container, as, with, all, holometabolans, beetle, larvae, pupate, and, from, these, pupae, emerge, fully, formed, sexually, mature, adult, beetles, or, imagos, pupae, never, have, mandibles, they, are, adecticous, in, most, pupae, the, appendages, are, not, attached, to, the, body, and, are, said, to, be, exarate, in, a, few, beetles, staphylinidae, ptiliidae, etc, the, appendages, are, fused, with, the, body, termed, as, obtect, pupae, adults, have, extremely, variable, lifespans, from, weeks, to, years, depending, on, the, species, some, wood, boring, beetles, can, have, extremely, long, life, cycles, it, is, believed, that, when, furniture, or, house, timbers, are, infested, by, beetle, larvae, the, timber, already, contained, the, larvae, when, it, was, first, sawn, up, a, birch, bookcase, 40, years, old, released, adult, eburia, quadrigeminata, cerambycidae, while, buprestis, aurulenta, and, other, buprestidae, have, been, documented, as, emerging, as, much, as, 51, years, after, manufacture, of, wooden, items, the, elytra, allow, beetles, to, both, fly, and, move, through, confined, spaces, doing, so, by, folding, the, delicate, wings, under, the, elytra, while, not, flying, and, folding, their, wings, out, just, before, takeoff, the, unfolding, and, folding, of, the, wings, is, operated, by, muscles, attached, to, the, wing, base, as, long, as, the, tension, on, the, radial, and, cubital, veins, remains, the, wings, remain, straight, some, beetle, species, many, cetoniinae, some, scarabaeinae, curculionidae, and, buprestidae, fly, with, the, elytra, closed, with, the, metathoracic, wings, extended, under, the, lateral, elytra, margins, the, altitude, reached, by, beetles, in, flight, varies, one, study, investigating, the, flight, altitude, of, the, ladybird, species, coccinella, septempunctata, and, harmonia, axyridis, using, radar, showed, that, whilst, the, majority, in, flight, over, a, single, location, were, at, 150, 195, m, above, ground, level, some, reached, altitudes, of, over, 1100, m, many, rove, beetles, have, greatly, reduced, elytra, and, while, they, are, capable, of, flight, they, most, often, move, on, the, ground, their, soft, bodies, and, strong, abdominal, muscles, make, them, flexible, easily, able, to, wriggle, into, small, cracks, aquatic, beetles, use, several, techniques, for, retaining, air, beneath, the, water, s, surface, diving, beetles, dytiscidae, hold, air, between, the, abdomen, and, the, elytra, when, diving, hydrophilidae, have, hairs, on, their, under, surface, that, retain, a, layer, of, air, against, their, bodies, adult, crawling, water, beetles, use, both, their, elytra, and, their, hind, coxae, the, basal, segment, of, the, back, legs, in, air, retention, while, whirligig, beetles, simply, carry, an, air, bubble, down, with, them, whenever, they, dive, beetles, have, a, variety, of, ways, to, communicate, including, the, use, of, pheromones, the, mountain, pine, beetle, emits, a, pheromone, to, attract, other, beetles, to, a, tree, the, mass, of, beetles, are, able, to, overcome, the, chemical, defenses, of, the, tree, after, the, tree, s, defenses, have, been, exhausted, the, beetles, emit, an, anti, aggregation, pheromone, this, species, can, stridulate, to, communicate, but, others, may, use, sound, to, defend, themselves, when, attacked, parental, care, is, found, in, a, few, families, of, beetle, perhaps, for, protection, against, adverse, conditions, and, predators, the, rove, beetle, bledius, spectabilis, lives, in, salt, marshes, so, the, eggs, and, larvae, are, endangered, by, the, rising, tide, the, maternal, beetle, patrols, the, eggs, and, larvae, burrowing, to, keep, them, from, flooding, and, asphyxiating, and, protects, them, from, the, predatory, carabid, beetle, dicheirotrichus, gustavii, and, from, the, parasitoidal, wasp, barycnemis, blediator, which, kills, some, 15, of, the, larvae, burying, beetles, are, attentive, parents, and, participate, in, cooperative, care, and, feeding, of, their, offspring, both, parents, work, to, bury, small, animal, carcass, to, serve, as, a, food, resource, for, their, young, and, build, a, brood, chamber, around, it, the, parents, prepare, the, carcass, and, protect, it, from, competitors, and, from, early, decomposition, after, their, eggs, hatch, the, parents, keep, the, larvae, clean, of, fungus, and, bacteria, and, help, the, larvae, feed, by, regurgitating, food, for, them, some, dung, beetles, provide, parental, care, collecting, herbivore, dung, and, laying, eggs, within, that, food, supply, an, instance, of, mass, provisioning, some, species, do, not, leave, after, this, stage, but, remain, to, safeguard, their, offspring, most, species, of, beetles, do, not, display, parental, care, behaviors, after, the, eggs, have, been, laid, subsociality, where, females, guard, their, offspring, is, well, documented, in, two, families, of, chrysomelidae, cassidinae, and, chrysomelinae, eusociality, involves, cooperative, brood, care, including, brood, care, of, offspring, from, other, individuals, overlapping, generations, within, a, colony, of, adults, and, a, division, of, labor, into, reproductive, and, non, reproductive, groups, few, organisms, outside, hymenoptera, exhibit, this, behavior, the, only, beetle, to, do, so, is, the, weevil, austroplatypus, incompertus, this, australian, species, lives, in, horizontal, networks, of, tunnels, in, the, heartwood, of, eucalyptus, trees, it, is, one, of, more, than, 300, species, of, wood, boring, ambrosia, beetles, which, distribute, the, spores, of, ambrosia, fungi, the, fungi, grow, in, the, beetles, tunnels, providing, food, for, the, beetles, and, their, larvae, female, offspring, remain, in, the, tunnels, and, maintain, the, fungal, growth, probably, never, reproducing, cooperative, brood, care, is, also, found, in, the, bess, beetles, passalidae, where, the, larvae, feed, on, the, semi, digested, faeces, of, the, adults, beetles, are, able, to, exploit, a, wide, diversity, of, food, sources, available, in, their, many, habitats, some, are, omnivores, eating, both, plants, and, animals, other, beetles, are, highly, specialized, in, their, diet, many, species, of, leaf, beetles, longhorn, beetles, and, weevils, are, very, host, specific, feeding, on, only, a, single, species, of, plant, ground, beetles, and, rove, beetles, staphylinidae, among, others, are, primarily, carnivorous, and, catch, and, consume, many, other, arthropods, and, small, prey, such, as, earthworms, and, snails, while, most, predatory, beetles, are, generalists, a, few, species, have, more, specific, prey, requirements, or, preferences, in, some, species, digestive, ability, relies, upon, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, fungi, some, beetles, have, yeasts, living, their, guts, including, some, yeasts, previously, undiscovered, anywhere, else, decaying, organic, matter, is, a, primary, diet, for, many, species, this, can, range, from, dung, which, is, consumed, by, coprophagous, species, such, as, certain, scarab, beetles, in, the, scarabaeidae, to, dead, animals, which, are, eaten, by, necrophagous, species, such, as, the, carrion, beetles, silphidae, some, beetles, found, in, dung, and, carrion, are, in, fact, predatory, these, include, members, of, the, histeridae, and, silphidae, preying, on, the, larvae, of, coprophagous, and, necrophagous, insects, many, beetles, feed, under, bark, some, feed, on, wood, while, others, feed, on, fungi, growing, on, wood, or, leaf, litter, some, beetles, have, special, mycangia, structures, for, the, transport, of, fungal, spores, beetles, both, adults, and, larvae, are, the, prey, of, many, animal, predators, including, mammals, from, bats, to, rodents, birds, lizards, amphibians, fishes, dragonflies, robberflies, reduviid, bugs, ants, other, beetles, and, spiders, beetles, use, a, variety, of, anti, predator, adaptations, to, defend, themselves, these, include, camouflage, and, mimicry, against, predators, that, hunt, by, sight, toxicity, and, defensive, behaviour, camouflage, is, common, and, widespread, among, beetle, families, especially, those, that, feed, on, wood, or, vegetation, such, as, leaf, beetles, chrysomelidae, which, are, often, green, and, weevils, in, some, species, sculpturing, or, various, colored, scales, or, hairs, cause, beetles, such, as, the, avocado, weevil, heilipus, apiatus, to, resemble, bird, dung, or, other, inedible, objects, many, beetles, that, live, in, sandy, environments, blend, in, with, the, coloration, of, that, substrate, some, longhorn, beetles, cerambycidae, are, effective, batesian, mimics, of, wasps, beetles, may, combine, coloration, with, behavioural, mimicry, acting, like, the, wasps, they, already, closely, resemble, many, other, beetles, including, ladybirds, blister, beetles, and, lycid, beetles, secrete, distasteful, or, toxic, substances, to, make, them, unpalatable, or, poisonous, and, are, often, aposematic, where, bright, or, contrasting, coloration, warn, off, predators, many, beetles, and, other, insects, mimic, these, chemically, protected, species, chemical, defense, is, important, in, some, species, usually, being, advertised, by, bright, aposematic, colors, some, tenebrionidae, use, their, posture, for, releasing, noxious, chemicals, to, warn, off, predators, chemical, defenses, may, serve, purposes, other, than, just, protection, from, vertebrates, such, as, protection, from, a, wide, range, of, microbes, some, species, sequester, chemicals, from, the, plants, they, feed, on, incorporating, them, into, their, own, defenses, other, species, have, special, glands, to, produce, deterrent, chemicals, the, defensive, glands, of, carabid, ground, beetles, produce, a, variety, of, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, phenols, quinones, esters, and, acids, released, from, an, opening, at, the, end, of, the, abdomen, african, carabid, beetles, for, example, anthia, employ, the, same, chemicals, as, ants, formic, acid, bombardier, beetles, have, well, developed, pygidial, glands, that, empty, from, the, sides, of, the, intersegment, membranes, between, the, seventh, and, eighth, abdominal, segments, the, gland, is, made, of, two, containing, chambers, one, for, hydroquinones, and, hydrogen, peroxide, the, other, holding, hydrogen, peroxide, and, catalase, enzymes, these, chemicals, mix, and, result, in, an, explosive, ejection, reaching, a, temperature, of, around, 100, c, 212, f, with, the, breakdown, of, hydroquinone, to, hydrogen, oxygen, and, quinone, the, oxygen, propels, the, noxious, chemical, spray, as, a, jet, that, can, be, aimed, accurately, at, predators, large, ground, dwelling, beetles, such, as, carabidae, the, rhinoceros, beetle, and, the, longhorn, beetles, defend, themselves, using, strong, mandibles, or, heavily, sclerotised, armored, spines, or, horns, to, deter, or, fight, off, predators, many, species, of, weevil, that, feed, out, in, the, open, on, leaves, of, plants, react, to, attack, by, employing, a, drop, off, reflex, some, combine, it, with, thanatosis, in, which, they, close, up, their, appendages, and, play, dead, the, click, beetles, elateridae, can, suddenly, catapult, themselves, out, of, danger, by, releasing, the, energy, stored, by, a, click, mechanism, which, consists, of, a, stout, spine, on, the, prosternum, and, a, matching, groove, in, the, mesosternum, some, species, startle, an, attacker, by, producing, sounds, through, a, process, known, as, stridulation, a, few, species, of, beetles, are, ectoparasitic, on, mammals, one, such, species, platypsyllus, castoris, parasitises, beavers, castor, spp, this, beetle, lives, as, a, parasite, both, as, a, larva, and, as, an, adult, feeding, on, epidermal, tissue, and, possibly, on, skin, secretions, and, wound, exudates, they, are, strikingly, flattened, dorsoventrally, no, doubt, as, an, adaptation, for, slipping, between, the, beavers, hairs, they, are, wingless, and, eyeless, as, are, many, other, ectoparasites, others, are, kleptoparasites, of, other, invertebrates, such, as, the, small, hive, beetle, aethina, tumida, that, infests, honey, bee, nests, while, many, species, are, parasitic, inquilines, or, commensal, in, the, nests, of, ants, a, few, groups, of, beetles, are, primary, parasitoids, of, other, insects, feeding, off, of, and, eventually, killing, their, hosts, beetle, pollinated, flowers, are, usually, large, greenish, or, off, white, in, color, and, heavily, scented, scents, may, be, spicy, fruity, or, similar, to, decaying, organic, material, beetles, were, most, likely, the, first, insects, to, pollinate, flowers, most, beetle, pollinated, flowers, are, flattened, or, dish, shaped, with, pollen, easily, accessible, although, they, may, include, traps, to, keep, the, beetle, longer, the, plants, ovaries, are, usually, well, protected, from, the, biting, mouthparts, of, their, pollinators, the, beetle, families, that, habitually, pollinate, flowers, are, the, buprestidae, cantharidae, cerambycidae, cleridae, dermestidae, lycidae, melyridae, mordellidae, nitidulidae, and, scarabaeidae, beetles, may, be, particularly, important, in, some, parts, of, the, world, such, as, semiarid, areas, of, southern, africa, and, southern, california, and, the, montane, grasslands, of, kwazulu, natal, in, south, africa, mutualism, is, well, known, in, a, few, beetles, such, as, the, ambrosia, beetle, which, partners, with, fungi, to, digest, the, wood, of, dead, trees, the, beetles, excavate, tunnels, in, dead, trees, in, which, they, cultivate, fungal, gardens, their, sole, source, of, nutrition, after, landing, on, a, suitable, tree, an, ambrosia, beetle, excavates, a, tunnel, in, which, it, releases, spores, of, its, fungal, symbiont, the, fungus, penetrates, the, plant, s, xylem, tissue, digests, it, and, concentrates, the, nutrients, on, and, near, the, surface, of, the, beetle, gallery, so, the, weevils, and, the, fungus, both, benefit, the, beetles, cannot, eat, the, wood, due, to, toxins, and, uses, its, relationship, with, fungi, to, help, overcome, the, defenses, of, its, host, tree, in, order, to, provide, nutrition, for, their, larvae, chemically, mediated, by, a, bacterially, produced, polyunsaturated, peroxide, this, mutualistic, relationship, between, the, beetle, and, the, fungus, is, coevolved, about, 90, of, beetle, species, enter, a, period, of, adult, diapause, a, quiet, phase, with, reduced, metabolism, to, tide, unfavourable, environmental, conditions, adult, diapause, is, the, most, common, form, of, diapause, in, coleoptera, to, endure, the, period, without, food, often, lasting, many, months, adults, prepare, by, accumulating, reserves, of, lipids, glycogen, proteins, and, other, substances, needed, for, resistance, to, future, hazardous, changes, of, environmental, conditions, this, diapause, is, induced, by, signals, heralding, the, arrival, of, the, unfavourable, season, usually, the, cue, is, photoperiodic, short, decreasing, day, length, serves, as, a, signal, of, approaching, winter, and, induces, winter, diapause, hibernation, a, study, of, hibernation, in, the, arctic, beetle, pterostichus, brevicornis, showed, that, the, body, fat, levels, of, adults, were, highest, in, autumn, with, the, alimentary, canal, filled, with, food, but, empty, by, the, end, of, january, this, loss, of, body, fat, was, a, gradual, process, occurring, in, combination, with, dehydration, all, insects, are, poikilothermic, so, the, ability, of, a, few, beetles, to, live, in, extreme, environments, depends, on, their, resilience, to, unusually, high, or, low, temperatures, the, bark, beetle, pityogenes, chalcographus, can, survive, 39, c, whilst, overwintering, beneath, tree, bark, the, alaskan, beetle, cucujus, clavipes, puniceus, is, able, to, withstand, 58, c, its, larvae, may, survive, 100, c, at, these, low, temperatures, the, formation, of, ice, crystals, in, internal, fluids, is, the, biggest, threat, to, survival, to, beetles, but, this, is, prevented, through, the, production, of, antifreeze, proteins, that, stop, water, molecules, from, grouping, together, the, low, temperatures, experienced, by, cucujus, clavipes, can, be, survived, through, their, deliberate, dehydration, in, conjunction, with, the, antifreeze, proteins, this, concentrates, the, antifreezes, several, fold, the, hemolymph, of, the, mealworm, beetle, tenebrio, molitor, contains, several, antifreeze, proteins, the, alaskan, beetle, upis, ceramboides, can, survive, 60, c, its, cryoprotectants, are, xylomannan, a, molecule, consisting, of, a, sugar, bound, to, a, fatty, acid, and, the, sugar, alcohol, threitol, conversely, desert, dwelling, beetles, are, adapted, to, tolerate, high, temperatures, for, example, the, tenebrionid, beetle, onymacris, rugatipennis, can, withstand, 50, c, tiger, beetles, in, hot, sandy, areas, are, often, whitish, for, example, habroscelimorpha, dorsalis, to, reflect, more, heat, than, a, darker, color, would, these, beetles, also, exhibits, behavioural, adaptions, to, tolerate, the, heat, they, are, able, to, stand, erect, on, their, tarsi, to, hold, their, bodies, away, from, the, hot, ground, seek, shade, and, turn, to, face, the, sun, so, that, only, the, front, parts, of, their, heads, are, directly, exposed, the, fogstand, beetle, of, the, namib, desert, stenocara, gracilipes, is, able, to, collect, water, from, fog, as, its, elytra, have, a, textured, surface, combining, hydrophilic, water, loving, bumps, and, waxy, hydrophobic, troughs, the, beetle, faces, the, early, morning, breeze, holding, up, its, abdomen, droplets, condense, on, the, elytra, and, run, along, ridges, towards, their, mouthparts, similar, adaptations, are, found, in, several, other, namib, desert, beetles, such, as, onymacris, unguicularis, some, terrestrial, beetles, that, exploit, shoreline, and, floodplain, habitats, have, physiological, adaptations, for, surviving, floods, in, the, event, of, flooding, adult, beetles, may, be, mobile, enough, to, move, away, from, flooding, but, larvae, and, pupa, often, cannot, adults, of, cicindela, togata, are, unable, to, survive, immersion, in, water, but, larvae, are, able, to, survive, a, prolonged, period, up, to, 6, days, of, anoxia, during, floods, anoxia, tolerance, in, the, larvae, may, have, been, sustained, by, switching, to, anaerobic, metabolic, pathways, or, by, reducing, metabolic, rate, anoxia, tolerance, in, the, adult, carabid, beetle, pelophilia, borealis, was, tested, in, laboratory, conditions, and, it, was, found, that, they, could, survive, a, continuous, period, of, up, to, 127, days, in, an, atmosphere, of, 99, 9, nitrogen, at, 0, c, many, beetle, species, undertake, annual, mass, movements, which, are, termed, as, migrations, these, include, the, pollen, beetle, meligethes, aeneus, and, many, species, of, coccinellids, these, mass, movements, may, also, be, opportunistic, in, search, of, food, rather, than, seasonal, a, 2008, study, of, an, unusually, large, outbreak, of, mountain, pine, beetle, dendroctonus, ponderosae, in, british, columbia, found, that, beetles, were, capable, of, flying, 30, 110, km, per, day, in, densities, of, up, to, 18, 600, beetles, per, hectare, several, species, of, dung, beetle, especially, the, sacred, scarab, scarabaeus, sacer, were, revered, in, ancient, egypt, the, hieroglyphic, image, of, the, beetle, may, have, had, existential, fictional, or, ontologic, significance, images, of, the, scarab, in, bone, ivory, stone, egyptian, faience, and, precious, metals, are, known, from, the, sixth, dynasty, and, up, to, the, period, of, roman, rule, the, scarab, was, of, prime, significance, in, the, funerary, cult, of, ancient, egypt, the, scarab, was, linked, to, khepri, the, god, of, the, rising, sun, from, the, supposed, resemblance, of, the, rolling, of, the, dung, ball, by, the, beetle, to, the, rolling, of, the, sun, by, the, god, some, of, ancient, egypt, s, neighbors, adopted, the, scarab, motif, for, seals, of, varying, types, the, best, known, of, these, are, the, judean, lmlk, seals, where, eight, of, 21, designs, contained, scarab, beetles, which, were, used, exclusively, to, stamp, impressions, on, storage, jars, during, the, reign, of, hezekiah, beetles, are, mentioned, as, a, symbol, of, the, sun, as, in, ancient, egypt, in, plutarch, s, 1st, century, moralia, the, greek, magical, papyri, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, to, the, 5th, century, ad, describe, scarabs, as, an, ingredient, in, a, spell, pliny, the, elder, discusses, beetles, in, his, natural, history, describing, the, stag, beetle, some, insects, for, the, preservation, of, their, wings, are, covered, with, an, erust, elytra, the, beetle, for, instance, the, wing, of, which, is, peculiarly, fine, and, frail, to, these, insects, a, sting, has, been, denied, by, nature, but, in, one, large, kind, we, find, horns, of, a, remarkable, length, two, pronged, at, the, extremities, and, forming, pincers, which, the, animal, closes, when, it, is, its, intention, to, bite, the, stag, beetle, is, recorded, in, a, greek, myth, by, nicander, and, recalled, by, antoninus, liberalis, in, which, cerambus, is, turned, into, a, beetle, he, can, be, seen, on, trunks, and, has, hook, teeth, ever, moving, his, jaws, together, he, is, black, long, and, has, hard, wings, like, a, great, dung, beetle, the, story, concludes, with, the, comment, that, the, beetles, were, used, as, toys, by, young, boys, and, that, the, head, was, removed, and, worn, as, a, pendant, about, 75, of, beetle, species, are, phytophagous, in, both, the, larval, and, adult, stages, many, feed, on, economically, important, plants, and, stored, plant, products, including, trees, cereals, tobacco, and, dried, fruits, some, such, as, the, boll, weevil, which, feeds, on, cotton, buds, and, flowers, can, cause, extremely, serious, damage, to, agriculture, the, boll, weevil, crossed, the, rio, grande, near, brownsville, texas, to, enter, the, united, states, from, mexico, around, 1892, and, had, reached, southeastern, alabama, by, 1915, by, the, mid, 1920s, it, had, entered, all, cotton, growing, regions, in, the, us, traveling, 40, to, 160, miles, 60, 260, km, per, year, it, remains, the, most, destructive, cotton, pest, in, north, america, mississippi, state, university, has, estimated, since, the, boll, weevil, entered, the, united, states, it, has, cost, cotton, producers, about, 13, billion, and, in, recent, times, about, 300, million, per, year, the, bark, beetle, elm, leaf, beetle, and, the, asian, longhorned, beetle, anoplophora, glabripennis, are, among, the, species, that, attack, elm, trees, bark, beetles, scolytidae, carry, dutch, elm, disease, as, they, move, from, infected, breeding, sites, to, healthy, trees, the, disease, has, devastated, elm, trees, across, europe, and, north, america, some, species, of, beetle, have, evolved, immunity, to, insecticides, for, example, the, colorado, potato, beetle, leptinotarsa, decemlineata, is, a, destructive, pest, of, potato, plants, its, hosts, include, other, members, of, the, solanaceae, such, as, nightshade, tomato, eggplant, and, capsicum, as, well, as, the, potato, different, populations, have, between, them, developed, resistance, to, all, major, classes, of, insecticide, the, colorado, potato, beetle, was, evaluated, as, a, tool, of, entomological, warfare, during, world, war, ii, the, idea, being, to, use, the, beetle, and, its, larvae, to, damage, the, crops, of, enemy, nations, germany, tested, its, colorado, potato, beetle, weaponisation, program, south, of, frankfurt, releasing, 54, 000, beetles, the, death, watch, beetle, xestobium, rufovillosum, ptinidae, is, a, serious, pest, of, older, wooden, buildings, in, europe, it, attacks, hardwoods, such, as, oak, and, chestnut, always, where, some, fungal, decay, has, taken, or, is, taking, place, the, actual, introduction, of, the, pest, into, buildings, is, thought, to, take, place, at, the, time, of, construction, other, pests, include, the, coconut, hispine, beetle, brontispa, longissima, which, feeds, on, young, leaves, seedlings, and, mature, coconut, trees, causing, serious, economic, damage, in, the, philippines, the, mountain, pine, beetle, is, a, destructive, pest, of, mature, or, weakened, lodgepole, pine, sometimes, affecting, large, areas, of, canada, beetles, can, be, beneficial, to, human, economics, by, controlling, the, populations, of, pests, the, larvae, and, adults, of, some, species, of, lady, beetles, coccinellidae, feed, on, aphids, that, are, pests, other, lady, beetles, feed, on, scale, insects, whitefly, and, mealybugs, if, normal, food, sources, are, scarce, they, may, feed, on, small, caterpillars, young, plant, bugs, or, honeydew, and, nectar, ground, beetles, carabidae, are, common, predators, of, many, insect, pests, including, fly, eggs, caterpillars, and, wireworms, ground, beetles, can, help, to, control, weeds, by, eating, their, seeds, in, the, soil, reducing, the, need, for, herbicides, to, protect, crops, the, effectiveness, of, some, species, in, reducing, certain, plant, populations, has, resulted, in, the, deliberate, introduction, of, beetles, in, order, to, control, weeds, for, example, the, genus, calligrapha, is, native, to, north, america, but, has, been, used, to, control, parthenium, hysterophorus, in, india, and, ambrosia, artemisiifolia, in, russia, dung, beetles, scarabidae, have, been, successfully, used, to, reduce, the, populations, of, pestilent, flies, such, as, musca, vetustissima, and, haematobia, exigua, which, are, serious, pests, of, cattle, in, australia, the, beetles, make, the, dung, unavailable, to, breeding, pests, by, quickly, rolling, and, burying, it, in, the, soil, with, the, added, effect, of, improving, soil, fertility, tilth, and, nutrient, cycling, the, australian, dung, beetle, project, 1965, 1985, introduced, species, of, dung, beetle, to, australia, from, south, africa, and, europe, to, reduce, populations, of, musca, vetustissima, following, successful, trials, of, this, technique, in, hawaii, the, american, institute, of, biological, sciences, reports, that, dung, beetles, such, as, euoniticellus, intermedius, save, the, united, states, cattle, industry, an, estimated, us, 380, million, annually, through, burying, above, ground, livestock, feces, the, dermestidae, are, often, used, in, taxidermy, and, in, the, preparation, of, scientific, specimens, to, clean, soft, tissue, from, bones, larvae, feed, on, and, remove, cartilage, along, with, other, soft, tissue, beetles, are, the, most, widely, eaten, insects, with, about, 344, species, used, as, food, usually, at, the, larval, stage, the, mealworm, the, larva, of, the, darkling, beetle, and, the, rhinoceros, beetle, are, among, the, species, commonly, eaten, a, wide, range, of, species, is, also, used, in, folk, medicine, to, treat, those, suffering, from, a, variety, of, disorders, and, illnesses, though, this, is, done, without, clinical, studies, supporting, the, efficacy, of, such, treatments, due, to, their, habitat, specificity, many, species, of, beetles, have, been, suggested, as, suitable, as, indicators, their, presence, numbers, or, absence, providing, a, measure, of, habitat, quality, predatory, beetles, such, as, the, tiger, beetles, cicindelidae, have, found, scientific, use, as, an, indicator, taxon, for, measuring, regional, patterns, of, biodiversity, they, are, suitable, for, this, as, their, taxonomy, is, stable, their, life, history, is, well, described, they, are, large, and, simple, to, observe, when, visiting, a, site, they, occur, around, the, world, in, many, habitats, with, species, specialised, to, particular, habitats, and, their, occurrence, by, species, accurately, indicates, other, species, both, vertebrate, and, invertebrate, according, to, the, habitats, many, other, groups, such, as, the, rove, beetles, in, human, modified, habitats, dung, beetles, in, savannas, and, saproxylic, beetles, in, forests, have, been, suggested, as, potential, indicator, species, many, beetles, have, durable, elytra, that, has, been, used, as, material, in, art, with, beetlewing, the, best, example, sometimes, they, are, incorporated, into, ritual, objects, for, their, religious, significance, whole, beetles, either, as, is, or, encased, in, clear, plastic, are, made, into, objects, ranging, from, cheap, souvenirs, such, as, key, chains, to, expensive, fine, art, jewellery, in, parts, of, mexico, beetles, of, the, genus, zopherus, are, made, into, living, brooches, by, attaching, costume, jewelry, and, golden, chains, which, is, made, possible, by, the, incredibly, hard, elytra, and, sedentary, habits, of, the, genus, fighting, beetles, are, used, for, entertainment, and, gambling, this, sport, exploits, the, territorial, behavior, and, mating, competition, of, certain, species, of, large, beetles, in, the, chiang, mai, district, of, northern, thailand, male, xylotrupes, rhinoceros, beetles, are, caught, in, the, wild, and, trained, for, fighting, females, are, held, inside, a, log, to, stimulate, the, fighting, males, with, their, pheromones, these, fights, may, be, competitive, and, involve, gambling, both, money, and, property, in, south, korea, the, dytiscidae, species, cybister, tripunctatus, is, used, in, a, roulette, like, game, beetles, are, sometimes, used, as, instruments, the, onabasulu, of, papua, new, guinea, historically, used, the, hugu, weevil, rhynchophorus, ferrugineus, as, a, musical, instrument, by, letting, the, human, mouth, serve, as, a, variable, resonance, chamber, for, the, wing, vibrations, of, the, live, adult, beetle, some, species, of, beetle, are, kept, as, pets, for, example, diving, beetles, dytiscidae, may, be, kept, in, a, domestic, fresh, water, tank, in, japan, the, practice, of, keeping, horned, rhinoceros, beetles, dynastinae, and, stag, beetles, lucanidae, is, particularly, popular, amongst, young, boys, such, is, the, popularity, in, japan, that, vending, machines, dispensing, live, beetles, were, developed, in, 1999, each, holding, up, to, 100, stag, beetles, beetle, collecting, became, extremely, popular, in, the, victorian, era, the, naturalist, alfred, russel, wallace, collected, by, his, own, count, a, total, of, 83, 200, beetles, during, the, eight, years, described, in, his, 1869, book, the, malay, archipelago, including, 2, 000, species, new, to, science, several, coleopteran, adaptations, have, attracted, interest, in, biomimetics, with, possible, commercial, applications, the, bombardier, beetle, s, powerful, repellent, spray, has, inspired, the, development, of, a, fine, mist, spray, technology, claimed, to, have, a, low, carbon, impact, compared, to, aerosol, sprays, moisture, harvesting, behavior, by, the, namib, desert, beetle, stenocara, gracilipes, has, inspired, a, self, filling, water, bottle, which, utilises, hydrophilic, and, hydrophobic, materials, to, benefit, people, living, in, dry, regions, with, no, regular, rainfall, living, beetles, have, been, used, as, cyborgs, a, defense, advanced, research, projects, agency, funded, project, implanted, electrodes, into, mecynorhina, torquata, beetles, allowing, them, to, be, remotely, controlled, via, a, radio, receiver, held, on, its, back, as, proof, of, concept, for, surveillance, work, similar, technology, has, been, applied, to, enable, a, human, operator, to, control, the, free, flight, steering, and, walking, gaits, of, mecynorhina, torquata, as, well, as, graded, turning, and, backward, walking, of, zophobas, morio, research, published, in, 2020, sought, to, create, a, robotic, camera, backpack, for, beetles, miniature, cameras, weighing, 248, mg, were, attached, to, live, beetles, of, the, tenebrionid, genera, asbolus, and, eleodes, the, cameras, filmed, over, a, 60, range, for, up, to, 6, hours, since, beetles, form, such, a, large, part, of, the, world, s, biodiversity, their, conservation, is, important, and, equally, loss, of, habitat, and, biodiversity, is, essentially, certain, to, impact, on, beetles, many, species, of, beetles, have, very, specific, habitats, and, long, life, cycles, that, make, them, vulnerable, some, species, are, highly, threatened, while, others, are, already, feared, extinct, island, species, tend, to, be, more, susceptible, as, in, the, case, of, helictopleurus, undatus, of, madagascar, which, is, thought, to, have, gone, extinct, during, the, late, 20th, century, conservationists, have, attempted, to, arouse, a, liking, for, beetles, with, flagship, species, like, the, stag, beetle, lucanus, cervus, and, tiger, beetles, cicindelidae, in, japan, the, genji, firefly, luciola, cruciata, is, extremely, popular, and, in, south, africa, the, addo, elephant, dung, beetle, offers, promise, for, broadening, ecotourism, beyond, the, big, five, tourist, mammal, species, popular, dislike, of, pest, beetles, too, can, be, turned, into, public, interest, in, insects, as, can, unusual, ecological, adaptations, of, species, like, the, fairy, shrimp, hunting, beetle, cicinis, bruchi
