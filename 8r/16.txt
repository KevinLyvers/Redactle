the, human, genome, is, a, complete, set, of, nucleic, acid, sequences, for, humans, encoded, as, dna, within, the, 23, chromosome, pairs, in, cell, nuclei, and, in, a, small, dna, molecule, found, within, individual, mitochondria, these, are, usually, treated, separately, as, the, nuclear, genome, and, the, mitochondrial, genome, human, genomes, include, both, protein, coding, dna, sequences, and, various, types, of, dna, that, does, not, encode, proteins, the, latter, is, a, diverse, category, that, includes, dna, coding, for, non, translated, rna, such, as, that, for, ribosomal, rna, transfer, rna, ribozymes, small, nuclear, rnas, and, several, types, of, regulatory, rnas, it, also, includes, promoters, and, their, associated, gene, regulatory, elements, dna, playing, structural, and, replicatory, roles, such, as, scaffolding, regions, telomeres, centromeres, and, origins, of, replication, plus, large, numbers, of, transposable, elements, inserted, viral, dna, non, functional, pseudogenes, and, simple, highly, repetitive, sequences, introns, make, up, a, large, percentage, of, non, coding, dna, some, of, this, non, coding, dna, is, non, functional, junk, dna, such, as, pseudogenes, but, there, is, no, firm, consensus, on, the, total, amount, of, junk, dna, although, the, sequence, of, the, human, genome, has, been, completely, determined, by, dna, sequencing, in, 2022, including, methylome, it, is, not, yet, fully, understood, most, but, not, all, genes, have, been, identified, by, a, combination, of, high, throughput, experimental, and, bioinformatics, approaches, yet, much, work, still, needs, to, be, done, to, further, elucidate, the, biological, functions, of, their, protein, and, rna, products, in, particular, annotation, of, the, complete, chm13v2, 0, sequence, is, still, ongoing, in, 2000, scientists, reported, the, sequencing, of, 88, of, the, entire, draft, of, the, haploid, human, genome, but, as, of, 2020, at, least, 8, was, still, missing, in, 2021, scientists, reported, sequencing, the, complete, haploid, female, genome, i, e, without, the, y, chromosome, the, human, y, chromosome, consisting, of, 62, 460, 029, base, pairs, from, a, different, cell, line, and, found, in, all, males, was, sequenced, completely, in, january, 2022, the, current, version, of, the, standard, reference, genome, is, called, grch38, p14, july, 2023, it, consists, of, 22, autosomes, plus, one, copy, of, the, x, chromosome, and, one, copy, of, the, y, chromosome, it, contains, approximately, 3, 1, billion, base, pairs, 3, 1, gb, or, 3, 1, x, 10, 9, bp, this, represents, the, size, of, a, composite, genome, based, on, data, from, multiple, individuals, but, it, is, a, good, indication, of, the, typical, amount, of, dna, in, a, haploid, set, of, chromosomes, but, y, chromosome, size, can, can, vary, a, lot, in, size, between, individuals, from, 45, 2, million, to, 84, 9, million, base, pairs, most, human, cells, are, diploid, so, they, contain, twice, as, much, dna, 6, 2, billion, base, pairs, in, 2023, a, draft, human, pangenome, reference, was, published, it, is, based, on, 47, genomes, from, persons, of, varied, ethnicity, plans, are, underway, for, an, improved, reference, capturing, still, more, biodiversity, from, a, still, wider, sample, while, there, are, significant, differences, among, the, genomes, of, human, individuals, on, the, order, of, 0, 1, due, to, single, nucleotide, variants, and, 0, 6, when, considering, indels, these, are, considerably, smaller, than, the, differences, between, humans, and, their, closest, living, relatives, the, bonobos, and, chimpanzees, 1, 1, fixed, single, nucleotide, variants, and, 4, when, including, indels, the, total, length, of, the, human, reference, genome, does, not, represent, the, sequence, of, any, specific, individual, nor, does, it, represent, the, sequence, of, all, of, the, dna, found, within, a, cell, an, actual, human, genome, is, organized, into, 22, paired, chromosomes, termed, autosomes, plus, the, 23rd, pair, of, sex, chromosomes, xx, in, the, female, and, xy, in, the, male, chromosomes, are, all, large, linear, dna, molecules, contained, within, the, cell, nucleus, the, current, version, of, the, human, reference, genome, only, includes, one, copy, of, each, of, the, paired, homologous, autosomes, plus, one, copy, of, the, two, sex, chromosomes, x, and, y, and, thus, represents, the, dna, sequence, for, a, haploid, set, of, chromosomes, the, total, amount, of, dna, in, this, reference, genome, is, 3, 1, billion, base, pairs, 3, 1, gb, an, actual, human, genome, as, contained, in, nuclei, of, most, cell, types, would, contain, twice, as, much, dna, protein, coding, sequences, represent, the, most, widely, studied, and, best, understood, component, of, the, human, genome, these, sequences, ultimately, lead, to, the, production, of, all, human, proteins, although, several, biological, processes, e, g, dna, rearrangements, and, alternative, pre, mrna, splicing, can, lead, to, the, production, of, many, more, unique, proteins, than, the, number, of, protein, coding, genes, the, human, reference, genome, contains, somewhere, between, 19, 000, and, 20, 000, protein, coding, genes, these, genes, contain, an, average, of, 10, introns, and, the, average, size, of, an, intron, is, about, 6, kb, 6, 000, bp, this, means, that, the, average, size, of, a, protein, coding, gene, is, about, 62, kb, and, these, genes, take, up, about, 40, of, the, genome, exon, sequences, consist, of, coding, dna, and, untranslated, regions, utrs, at, either, end, of, the, mature, mrna, the, total, amount, of, coding, dna, is, about, 1, 2, of, the, genome, many, people, divide, the, genome, into, coding, and, non, coding, dna, based, on, the, idea, that, coding, dna, is, the, most, important, functional, component, of, the, genome, about, 98, 99, of, the, human, genome, is, non, coding, dna, noncoding, rna, molecules, play, many, essential, roles, in, cells, especially, in, the, many, reactions, of, protein, synthesis, and, rna, processing, noncoding, rna, include, trna, ribosomal, rna, microrna, snrna, and, other, non, coding, rna, genes, including, about, 60, 000, long, non, coding, rnas, lncrnas, although, the, number, of, reported, lncrna, genes, continues, to, rise, and, the, exact, number, in, the, human, genome, is, yet, to, be, defined, many, of, them, are, argued, to, be, non, functional, many, ncrnas, are, critical, elements, in, gene, regulation, and, expression, noncoding, rna, also, contributes, to, epigenetics, transcription, rna, splicing, and, the, translational, machinery, the, role, of, rna, in, genetic, regulation, and, disease, offers, a, new, potential, level, of, unexplored, genomic, complexity, pseudogenes, are, inactive, copies, of, protein, coding, genes, often, generated, by, gene, duplication, that, have, become, nonfunctional, through, the, accumulation, of, inactivating, mutations, the, number, of, pseudogenes, in, the, human, genome, is, on, the, order, of, 13, 000, and, in, some, chromosomes, is, nearly, the, same, as, the, number, of, functional, protein, coding, genes, gene, duplication, is, a, major, mechanism, through, which, new, genetic, material, is, generated, during, molecular, evolution, for, example, the, olfactory, receptor, gene, family, is, one, of, the, best, documented, examples, of, pseudogenes, in, the, human, genome, more, than, 60, percent, of, the, genes, in, this, family, are, non, functional, pseudogenes, in, humans, by, comparison, only, 20, percent, of, genes, in, the, mouse, olfactory, receptor, gene, family, are, pseudogenes, research, suggests, that, this, is, a, species, specific, characteristic, as, the, most, closely, related, primates, all, have, proportionally, fewer, pseudogenes, this, genetic, discovery, helps, to, explain, the, less, acute, sense, of, smell, in, humans, relative, to, other, mammals, the, human, genome, has, many, different, regulatory, sequences, which, are, crucial, to, controlling, gene, expression, conservative, estimates, indicate, that, these, sequences, make, up, 8, of, the, genome, however, extrapolations, from, the, encode, project, give, that, 20, or, more, of, the, genome, is, gene, regulatory, sequence, some, types, of, non, coding, dna, are, genetic, switches, that, do, not, encode, proteins, but, do, regulate, when, and, where, genes, are, expressed, called, enhancers, regulatory, sequences, have, been, known, since, the, late, 1960s, the, first, identification, of, regulatory, sequences, in, the, human, genome, relied, on, recombinant, dna, technology, later, with, the, advent, of, genomic, sequencing, the, identification, of, these, sequences, could, be, inferred, by, evolutionary, conservation, the, evolutionary, branch, between, the, primates, and, mouse, for, example, occurred, 70, 90, million, years, ago, so, computer, comparisons, of, gene, sequences, that, identify, conserved, non, coding, sequences, will, be, an, indication, of, their, importance, in, duties, such, as, gene, regulation, other, genomes, have, been, sequenced, with, the, same, intention, of, aiding, conservation, guided, methods, for, exampled, the, pufferfish, genome, however, regulatory, sequences, disappear, and, re, evolve, during, evolution, at, a, high, rate, as, of, 2012, the, efforts, have, shifted, toward, finding, interactions, between, dna, and, regulatory, proteins, by, the, technique, chip, seq, or, gaps, where, the, dna, is, not, packaged, by, histones, dnase, hypersensitive, sites, both, of, which, tell, where, there, are, active, regulatory, sequences, in, the, investigated, cell, type, repetitive, dna, sequences, comprise, approximately, 50, of, the, human, genome, about, 8, of, the, human, genome, consists, of, tandem, dna, arrays, or, tandem, repeats, low, complexity, repeat, sequences, that, have, multiple, adjacent, copies, e, g, cagcagcag, the, tandem, sequences, may, be, of, variable, lengths, from, two, nucleotides, to, tens, of, nucleotides, these, sequences, are, highly, variable, even, among, closely, related, individuals, and, so, are, used, for, genealogical, dna, testing, and, forensic, dna, analysis, repeated, sequences, of, fewer, than, ten, nucleotides, e, g, the, dinucleotide, repeat, ac, n, are, termed, microsatellite, sequences, among, the, microsatellite, sequences, trinucleotide, repeats, are, of, particular, importance, as, sometimes, occur, within, coding, regions, of, genes, for, proteins, and, may, lead, to, genetic, disorders, for, example, huntington, s, disease, results, from, an, expansion, of, the, trinucleotide, repeat, cag, n, within, the, huntingtin, gene, on, human, chromosome, 4, telomeres, the, ends, of, linear, chromosomes, end, with, a, microsatellite, hexanucleotide, repeat, of, the, sequence, ttaggg, n, tandem, repeats, of, longer, sequences, arrays, of, repeated, sequences, 10, 60, nucleotides, long, are, termed, minisatellites, transposable, genetic, elements, dna, sequences, that, can, replicate, and, insert, copies, of, themselves, at, other, locations, within, a, host, genome, are, an, abundant, component, in, the, human, genome, the, most, abundant, transposon, lineage, alu, has, about, 50, 000, active, copies, and, can, be, inserted, into, intragenic, and, intergenic, regions, one, other, lineage, line, 1, has, about, 100, active, copies, per, genome, the, number, varies, between, people, together, with, non, functional, relics, of, old, transposons, they, account, for, over, half, of, total, human, dna, sometimes, called, jumping, genes, transposons, have, played, a, major, role, in, sculpting, the, human, genome, some, of, these, sequences, represent, endogenous, retroviruses, dna, copies, of, viral, sequences, that, have, become, permanently, integrated, into, the, genome, and, are, now, passed, on, to, succeeding, generations, there, are, also, a, significant, number, of, retroviruses, in, human, dna, at, least, 3, of, which, have, been, proven, to, possess, an, important, function, i, e, hiv, like, functional, herv, k, envelope, genes, of, non, functional, viruses, herv, w, and, herv, frd, play, a, role, in, placenta, formation, by, inducing, cell, cell, fusion, mobile, elements, within, the, human, genome, can, be, classified, into, ltr, retrotransposons, 8, 3, of, total, genome, sines, 13, 1, of, total, genome, including, alu, elements, lines, 20, 4, of, total, genome, svas, sine, vntr, alu, and, class, ii, dna, transposons, 2, 9, of, total, genome, there, is, no, consensus, on, what, constitutes, a, functional, element, in, the, genome, since, geneticists, evolutionary, biologists, and, molecular, biologists, employ, different, definitions, and, methods, due, to, the, ambiguity, in, the, terminology, different, schools, of, thought, have, emerged, in, evolutionary, definitions, functional, dna, whether, it, is, coding, or, non, coding, contributes, to, the, fitness, of, the, organism, and, therefore, is, maintained, by, negative, evolutionary, pressure, whereas, non, functional, dna, has, no, benefit, to, the, organism, and, therefore, is, under, neutral, selective, pressure, this, type, of, dna, has, been, described, as, junk, dna, in, genetic, definitions, functional, dna, is, related, to, how, dna, segments, manifest, by, phenotype, and, nonfunctional, is, related, to, loss, of, function, effects, on, the, organism, in, biochemical, definitions, functional, dna, relates, to, dna, sequences, that, specify, molecular, products, e, g, noncoding, rnas, and, biochemical, activities, with, mechanistic, roles, in, gene, or, genome, regulation, i, e, dna, sequences, that, impact, cellular, level, activity, such, as, cell, type, condition, and, molecular, processes, there, is, no, consensus, in, the, literature, on, the, amount, of, functional, dna, since, depending, on, how, function, is, understood, ranges, have, been, estimated, from, up, to, 90, of, the, human, genome, is, likely, nonfunctional, dna, junk, dna, to, up, to, 80, of, the, genome, is, likely, functional, it, is, also, possible, that, junk, dna, may, acquire, a, function, in, the, future, and, therefore, may, play, a, role, in, evolution, but, this, is, likely, to, occur, only, very, rarely, finally, dna, that, is, deliterious, to, the, organism, and, is, under, negative, selective, pressure, is, called, garbage, dna, the, first, human, genome, sequences, were, published, in, nearly, complete, draft, form, in, february, 2001, by, the, human, genome, project, and, celera, corporation, completion, of, the, human, genome, project, s, sequencing, effort, was, announced, in, 2004, with, the, publication, of, a, draft, genome, sequence, leaving, just, 341, gaps, in, the, sequence, representing, highly, repetitive, and, other, dna, that, could, not, be, sequenced, with, the, technology, available, at, the, time, the, human, genome, was, the, first, of, all, vertebrates, to, be, sequenced, to, such, near, completion, and, as, of, 2018, the, diploid, genomes, of, over, a, million, individual, humans, had, been, determined, using, next, generation, sequencing, these, data, are, used, worldwide, in, biomedical, science, anthropology, forensics, and, other, branches, of, science, such, genomic, studies, have, led, to, advances, in, the, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, diseases, and, to, new, insights, in, many, fields, of, biology, including, human, evolution, by, 2018, the, total, number, of, genes, had, been, raised, to, at, least, 46, 831, plus, another, 2300, micro, rna, genes, a, 2018, population, survey, found, another, 300, million, bases, of, human, genome, that, was, not, in, the, reference, sequence, prior, to, the, acquisition, of, the, full, genome, sequence, estimates, of, the, number, of, human, genes, ranged, from, 50, 000, to, 140, 000, with, occasional, vagueness, about, whether, these, estimates, included, non, protein, coding, genes, as, genome, sequence, quality, and, the, methods, for, identifying, protein, coding, genes, improved, the, count, of, recognized, protein, coding, genes, dropped, to, 19, 000, 20, 000, in, 2022, the, telomere, to, telomere, t2t, consortium, reported, the, complete, sequence, of, a, human, female, genome, filling, all, the, gaps, in, the, x, chromosome, 2020, and, the, 22, autosomes, may, 2021, the, previously, unsequenced, parts, contain, immune, response, genes, that, help, to, adapt, to, and, survive, infections, as, well, as, genes, that, are, important, for, predicting, drug, response, the, completed, human, genome, sequence, will, also, provide, better, understanding, of, human, formation, as, an, individual, organism, and, how, humans, vary, both, between, each, other, and, other, species, although, the, completion, of, the, human, genome, project, was, announced, in, 2001, there, remained, hundreds, of, gaps, with, about, 5, 10, of, the, total, sequence, remaining, undetermined, the, missing, genetic, information, was, mostly, in, repetitive, heterochromatic, regions, and, near, the, centromeres, and, telomeres, but, also, some, gene, encoding, euchromatic, regions, there, remained, 160, euchromatic, gaps, in, 2015, when, the, sequences, spanning, another, 50, formerly, unsequenced, regions, were, determined, only, in, 2020, was, the, first, truly, complete, telomere, to, telomere, sequence, of, a, human, chromosome, determined, namely, of, the, x, chromosome, the, first, complete, telomere, to, telomere, sequence, of, a, human, autosomal, chromosome, chromosome, 8, followed, a, year, later, the, complete, human, genome, without, y, chromosome, was, published, in, 2021, while, with, y, chromosome, in, january, 2022, in, 2023, a, draft, human, pangenome, reference, was, published, it, is, based, on, 47, genomes, from, persons, of, varied, ethnicity, plans, are, underway, for, an, improved, reference, capturing, still, more, biodiversity, from, a, still, wider, sample, with, the, exception, of, identical, twins, all, humans, show, significant, variation, in, genomic, dna, sequences, the, human, reference, genome, hrg, is, used, as, a, standard, sequence, reference, there, are, several, important, points, concerning, the, human, reference, genome, the, genome, reference, consortium, is, responsible, for, updating, the, hrg, version, 38, was, released, in, december, 2013, most, studies, of, human, genetic, variation, have, focused, on, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, snps, which, are, substitutions, in, individual, bases, along, a, chromosome, most, analyses, estimate, that, snps, occur, 1, in, 1000, base, pairs, on, average, in, the, euchromatic, human, genome, although, they, do, not, occur, at, a, uniform, density, thus, follows, the, popular, statement, that, we, are, all, regardless, of, race, genetically, 99, 9, the, same, although, this, would, be, somewhat, qualified, by, most, geneticists, for, example, a, much, larger, fraction, of, the, genome, is, now, thought, to, be, involved, in, copy, number, variation, a, large, scale, collaborative, effort, to, catalog, snp, variations, in, the, human, genome, is, being, undertaken, by, the, international, hapmap, project, the, genomic, loci, and, length, of, certain, types, of, small, repetitive, sequences, are, highly, variable, from, person, to, person, which, is, the, basis, of, dna, fingerprinting, and, dna, paternity, testing, technologies, the, heterochromatic, portions, of, the, human, genome, which, total, several, hundred, million, base, pairs, are, also, thought, to, be, quite, variable, within, the, human, population, they, are, so, repetitive, and, so, long, that, they, cannot, be, accurately, sequenced, with, current, technology, these, regions, contain, few, genes, and, it, is, unclear, whether, any, significant, phenotypic, effect, results, from, typical, variation, in, repeats, or, heterochromatin, most, gross, genomic, mutations, in, gamete, germ, cells, probably, result, in, inviable, embryos, however, a, number, of, human, diseases, are, related, to, large, scale, genomic, abnormalities, down, syndrome, turner, syndrome, and, a, number, of, other, diseases, result, from, nondisjunction, of, entire, chromosomes, cancer, cells, frequently, have, aneuploidy, of, chromosomes, and, chromosome, arms, although, a, cause, and, effect, relationship, between, aneuploidy, and, cancer, has, not, been, established, whereas, a, genome, sequence, lists, the, order, of, every, dna, base, in, a, genome, a, genome, map, identifies, the, landmarks, a, genome, map, is, less, detailed, than, a, genome, sequence, and, aids, in, navigating, around, the, genome, an, example, of, a, variation, map, is, the, hapmap, being, developed, by, the, international, hapmap, project, the, hapmap, is, a, haplotype, map, of, the, human, genome, which, will, describe, the, common, patterns, of, human, dna, sequence, variation, it, catalogs, the, patterns, of, small, scale, variations, in, the, genome, that, involve, single, dna, letters, or, bases, researchers, published, the, first, sequence, based, map, of, large, scale, structural, variation, across, the, human, genome, in, the, journal, nature, in, may, 2008, large, scale, structural, variations, are, differences, in, the, genome, among, people, that, range, from, a, few, thousand, to, a, few, million, dna, bases, some, are, gains, or, losses, of, stretches, of, genome, sequence, and, others, appear, as, re, arrangements, of, stretches, of, sequence, these, variations, include, differences, in, the, number, of, copies, individuals, have, of, a, particular, gene, deletions, translocations, and, inversions, structural, variation, refers, to, genetic, variants, that, affect, larger, segments, of, the, human, genome, as, opposed, to, point, mutations, often, structural, variants, svs, are, defined, as, variants, of, 50, base, pairs, bp, or, greater, such, as, deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions, and, other, rearrangements, about, 90, of, structural, variants, are, noncoding, deletions, but, most, individuals, have, more, than, a, thousand, such, deletions, the, size, of, deletions, ranges, from, dozens, of, base, pairs, to, tens, of, thousands, of, bp, on, average, individuals, carry, 3, rare, structural, variants, that, alter, coding, regions, e, g, delete, exons, about, 2, of, individuals, carry, ultra, rare, megabase, scale, structural, variants, especially, rearrangements, that, is, millions, of, base, pairs, may, be, inverted, within, a, chromosome, ultra, rare, means, that, they, are, only, found, in, individuals, or, their, family, members, and, thus, have, arisen, very, recently, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, snps, do, not, occur, homogeneously, across, the, human, genome, in, fact, there, is, enormous, diversity, in, snp, frequency, between, genes, reflecting, different, selective, pressures, on, each, gene, as, well, as, different, mutation, and, recombination, rates, across, the, genome, however, studies, on, snps, are, biased, towards, coding, regions, the, data, generated, from, them, are, unlikely, to, reflect, the, overall, distribution, of, snps, throughout, the, genome, therefore, the, snp, consortium, protocol, was, designed, to, identify, snps, with, no, bias, towards, coding, regions, and, the, consortium, s, 100, 000, snps, generally, reflect, sequence, diversity, across, the, human, chromosomes, the, snp, consortium, aims, to, expand, the, number, of, snps, identified, across, the, genome, to, 300, 000, by, the, end, of, the, first, quarter, of, 2001, changes, in, non, coding, sequence, and, synonymous, changes, in, coding, sequence, are, generally, more, common, than, non, synonymous, changes, reflecting, greater, selective, pressure, reducing, diversity, at, positions, dictating, amino, acid, identity, transitional, changes, are, more, common, than, transversions, with, cpg, dinucleotides, showing, the, highest, mutation, rate, presumably, due, to, deamination, a, personal, genome, sequence, is, a, nearly, complete, sequence, of, the, chemical, base, pairs, that, make, up, the, dna, of, a, single, person, because, medical, treatments, have, different, effects, on, different, people, due, to, genetic, variations, such, as, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, snps, the, analysis, of, personal, genomes, may, lead, to, personalized, medical, treatment, based, on, individual, genotypes, the, first, personal, genome, sequence, to, be, determined, was, that, of, craig, venter, in, 2007, personal, genomes, had, not, been, sequenced, in, the, public, human, genome, project, to, protect, the, identity, of, volunteers, who, provided, dna, samples, that, sequence, was, derived, from, the, dna, of, several, volunteers, from, a, diverse, population, however, early, in, the, venter, led, celera, genomics, genome, sequencing, effort, the, decision, was, made, to, switch, from, sequencing, a, composite, sample, to, using, dna, from, a, single, individual, later, revealed, to, have, been, venter, himself, thus, the, celera, human, genome, sequence, released, in, 2000, was, largely, that, of, one, man, subsequent, replacement, of, the, early, composite, derived, data, and, determination, of, the, diploid, sequence, representing, both, sets, of, chromosomes, rather, than, a, haploid, sequence, originally, reported, allowed, the, release, of, the, first, personal, genome, in, april, 2008, that, of, james, watson, was, also, completed, in, 2009, stephen, quake, published, his, own, genome, sequence, derived, from, a, sequencer, of, his, own, design, the, heliscope, a, stanford, team, led, by, euan, ashley, published, a, framework, for, the, medical, interpretation, of, human, genomes, implemented, on, quake, s, genome, and, made, whole, genome, informed, medical, decisions, for, the, first, time, that, team, further, extended, the, approach, to, the, west, family, the, first, family, sequenced, as, part, of, illumina, s, personal, genome, sequencing, program, since, then, hundreds, of, personal, genome, sequences, have, been, released, including, those, of, desmond, tutu, and, of, a, paleo, eskimo, in, 2012, the, whole, genome, sequences, of, two, family, trios, among, 1092, genomes, was, made, public, in, november, 2013, a, spanish, family, made, four, personal, exome, datasets, about, 1, of, the, genome, publicly, available, under, a, creative, commons, public, domain, license, the, personal, genome, project, started, in, 2005, is, among, the, few, to, make, both, genome, sequences, and, corresponding, medical, phenotypes, publicly, available, the, sequencing, of, individual, genomes, further, unveiled, levels, of, genetic, complexity, that, had, not, been, appreciated, before, personal, genomics, helped, reveal, the, significant, level, of, diversity, in, the, human, genome, attributed, not, only, to, snps, but, structural, variations, as, well, however, the, application, of, such, knowledge, to, the, treatment, of, disease, and, in, the, medical, field, is, only, in, its, very, beginnings, exome, sequencing, has, become, increasingly, popular, as, a, tool, to, aid, in, diagnosis, of, genetic, disease, because, the, exome, contributes, only, 1, of, the, genomic, sequence, but, accounts, for, roughly, 85, of, mutations, that, contribute, significantly, to, disease, in, humans, gene, knockouts, naturally, occur, as, heterozygous, or, homozygous, loss, of, function, gene, knockouts, these, knockouts, are, often, difficult, to, distinguish, especially, within, heterogeneous, genetic, backgrounds, they, are, also, difficult, to, find, as, they, occur, in, low, frequencies, populations, with, high, rates, of, consanguinity, such, as, countries, with, high, rates, of, first, cousin, marriages, display, the, highest, frequencies, of, homozygous, gene, knockouts, such, populations, include, pakistan, iceland, and, amish, populations, these, populations, with, a, high, level, of, parental, relatedness, have, been, subjects, of, human, knock, out, research, which, has, helped, to, determine, the, function, of, specific, genes, in, humans, by, distinguishing, specific, knockouts, researchers, are, able, to, use, phenotypic, analyses, of, these, individuals, to, help, characterize, the, gene, that, has, been, knocked, out, knockouts, in, specific, genes, can, cause, genetic, diseases, potentially, have, beneficial, effects, or, even, result, in, no, phenotypic, effect, at, all, however, determining, a, knockout, s, phenotypic, effect, and, in, humans, can, be, challenging, challenges, to, characterizing, and, clinically, interpreting, knockouts, include, difficulty, calling, of, dna, variants, determining, disruption, of, protein, function, annotation, and, considering, the, amount, of, influence, mosaicism, has, on, the, phenotype, one, major, study, that, investigated, human, knockouts, is, the, pakistan, risk, of, myocardial, infarction, study, it, was, found, that, individuals, possessing, a, heterozygous, loss, of, function, gene, knockout, for, the, apoc3, gene, had, lower, triglycerides, in, the, blood, after, consuming, a, high, fat, meal, as, compared, to, individuals, without, the, mutation, however, individuals, possessing, homozygous, loss, of, function, gene, knockouts, of, the, apoc3, gene, displayed, the, lowest, level, of, triglycerides, in, the, blood, after, the, fat, load, test, as, they, produce, no, functional, apoc3, protein, most, aspects, of, human, biology, involve, both, genetic, inherited, and, non, genetic, environmental, factors, some, inherited, variation, influences, aspects, of, our, biology, that, are, not, medical, in, nature, height, eye, color, ability, to, taste, or, smell, certain, compounds, etc, moreover, some, genetic, disorders, only, cause, disease, in, combination, with, the, appropriate, environmental, factors, such, as, diet, with, these, caveats, genetic, disorders, may, be, described, as, clinically, defined, diseases, caused, by, genomic, dna, sequence, variation, in, the, most, straightforward, cases, the, disorder, can, be, associated, with, variation, in, a, single, gene, for, example, cystic, fibrosis, is, caused, by, mutations, in, the, cftr, gene, and, is, the, most, common, recessive, disorder, in, caucasian, populations, with, over, 1, 300, different, mutations, known, disease, causing, mutations, in, specific, genes, are, usually, severe, in, terms, of, gene, function, and, are, rare, thus, genetic, disorders, are, similarly, individually, rare, however, since, there, are, many, genes, that, can, vary, to, cause, genetic, disorders, in, aggregate, they, constitute, a, significant, component, of, known, medical, conditions, especially, in, pediatric, medicine, molecularly, characterized, genetic, disorders, are, those, for, which, the, underlying, causal, gene, has, been, identified, currently, there, are, approximately, 2, 200, such, disorders, annotated, in, the, omim, database, studies, of, genetic, disorders, are, often, performed, by, means, of, family, based, studies, in, some, instances, population, based, approaches, are, employed, particularly, in, the, case, of, so, called, founder, populations, such, as, those, in, finland, french, canada, utah, sardinia, etc, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, genetic, disorders, are, usually, performed, by, a, geneticist, physician, trained, in, clinical, medical, genetics, the, results, of, the, human, genome, project, are, likely, to, provide, increased, availability, of, genetic, testing, for, gene, related, disorders, and, eventually, improved, treatment, parents, can, be, screened, for, hereditary, conditions, and, counselled, on, the, consequences, the, probability, of, inheritance, and, how, to, avoid, or, ameliorate, it, in, their, offspring, there, are, many, different, kinds, of, dna, sequence, variation, ranging, from, complete, extra, or, missing, chromosomes, down, to, single, nucleotide, changes, it, is, generally, presumed, that, much, naturally, occurring, genetic, variation, in, human, populations, is, phenotypically, neutral, i, e, has, little, or, no, detectable, effect, on, the, physiology, of, the, individual, although, there, may, be, fractional, differences, in, fitness, defined, over, evolutionary, time, frames, genetic, disorders, can, be, caused, by, any, or, all, known, types, of, sequence, variation, to, molecularly, characterize, a, new, genetic, disorder, it, is, necessary, to, establish, a, causal, link, between, a, particular, genomic, sequence, variant, and, the, clinical, disease, under, investigation, such, studies, constitute, the, realm, of, human, molecular, genetics, with, the, advent, of, the, human, genome, and, international, hapmap, project, it, has, become, feasible, to, explore, subtle, genetic, influences, on, many, common, disease, conditions, such, as, diabetes, asthma, migraine, schizophrenia, etc, although, some, causal, links, have, been, made, between, genomic, sequence, variants, in, particular, genes, and, some, of, these, diseases, often, with, much, publicity, in, the, general, media, these, are, usually, not, considered, to, be, genetic, disorders, per, se, as, their, causes, are, complex, involving, many, different, genetic, and, environmental, factors, thus, there, may, be, disagreement, in, particular, cases, whether, a, specific, medical, condition, should, be, termed, a, genetic, disorder, additional, genetic, disorders, of, mention, are, kallman, syndrome, and, pfeiffer, syndrome, gene, fgfr1, fuchs, corneal, dystrophy, gene, tcf4, hirschsprung, s, disease, genes, ret, and, fech, bardet, biedl, syndrome, 1, genes, ccdc28b, and, bbs1, bardet, biedl, syndrome, 10, gene, bbs10, and, facioscapulohumeral, muscular, dystrophy, type, 2, genes, d4z4, and, smchd1, genome, sequencing, is, now, able, to, narrow, the, genome, down, to, specific, locations, to, more, accurately, find, mutations, that, will, result, in, a, genetic, disorder, copy, number, variants, cnvs, and, single, nucleotide, variants, snvs, are, also, able, to, be, detected, at, the, same, time, as, genome, sequencing, with, newer, sequencing, procedures, available, called, next, generation, sequencing, ngs, this, only, analyzes, a, small, portion, of, the, genome, around, 1, 2, the, results, of, this, sequencing, can, be, used, for, clinical, diagnosis, of, a, genetic, condition, including, usher, syndrome, retinal, disease, hearing, impairments, diabetes, epilepsy, leigh, disease, hereditary, cancers, neuromuscular, diseases, primary, immunodeficiencies, severe, combined, immunodeficiency, scid, and, diseases, of, the, mitochondria, ngs, can, also, be, used, to, identify, carriers, of, diseases, before, conception, the, diseases, that, can, be, detected, in, this, sequencing, include, tay, sachs, disease, bloom, syndrome, gaucher, disease, canavan, disease, familial, dysautonomia, cystic, fibrosis, spinal, muscular, atrophy, and, fragile, x, syndrome, the, next, genome, sequencing, can, be, narrowed, down, to, specifically, look, for, diseases, more, prevalent, in, certain, ethnic, populations, 1, 15000, in, american, caucasians, 1, 176, in, mennonite, amish, communities, 1, 250000, in, austria, 1, 28000, in, norway, 1, 12500, in, germany, comparative, genomics, studies, of, mammalian, genomes, suggest, that, approximately, 5, of, the, human, genome, has, been, conserved, by, evolution, since, the, divergence, of, extant, lineages, approximately, 200, million, years, ago, containing, the, vast, majority, of, genes, the, published, chimpanzee, genome, differs, from, that, of, the, human, genome, by, 1, 23, in, direct, sequence, comparisons, around, 20, of, this, figure, is, accounted, for, by, variation, within, each, species, leaving, only, 1, 06, consistent, sequence, divergence, between, humans, and, chimps, at, shared, genes, this, nucleotide, by, nucleotide, difference, is, dwarfed, however, by, the, portion, of, each, genome, that, is, not, shared, including, around, 6, of, functional, genes, that, are, unique, to, either, humans, or, chimps, in, other, words, the, considerable, observable, differences, between, humans, and, chimps, may, be, due, as, much, or, more, to, genome, level, variation, in, the, number, function, and, expression, of, genes, rather, than, dna, sequence, changes, in, shared, genes, indeed, even, within, humans, there, has, been, found, to, be, a, previously, unappreciated, amount, of, copy, number, variation, cnv, which, can, make, up, as, much, as, 5, 15, of, the, human, genome, in, other, words, between, humans, there, could, be, 500, 000, 000, base, pairs, of, dna, some, being, active, genes, others, inactivated, or, active, at, different, levels, the, full, significance, of, this, finding, remains, to, be, seen, on, average, a, typical, human, protein, coding, gene, differs, from, its, chimpanzee, ortholog, by, only, two, amino, acid, substitutions, nearly, one, third, of, human, genes, have, exactly, the, same, protein, translation, as, their, chimpanzee, orthologs, a, major, difference, between, the, two, genomes, is, human, chromosome, 2, which, is, equivalent, to, a, fusion, product, of, chimpanzee, chromosomes, 12, and, 13, later, renamed, to, chromosomes, 2a, and, 2b, respectively, humans, have, undergone, an, extraordinary, loss, of, olfactory, receptor, genes, during, our, recent, evolution, which, explains, our, relatively, crude, sense, of, smell, compared, to, most, other, mammals, evolutionary, evidence, suggests, that, the, emergence, of, color, vision, in, humans, and, several, other, primate, species, has, diminished, the, need, for, the, sense, of, smell, in, september, 2016, scientists, reported, that, based, on, human, dna, genetic, studies, all, non, africans, in, the, world, today, can, be, traced, to, a, single, population, that, exited, africa, between, 50, 000, and, 80, 000, years, ago, the, human, mitochondrial, dna, is, of, tremendous, interest, to, geneticists, since, it, undoubtedly, plays, a, role, in, mitochondrial, disease, it, also, sheds, light, on, human, evolution, for, example, analysis, of, variation, in, the, human, mitochondrial, genome, has, led, to, the, postulation, of, a, recent, common, ancestor, for, all, humans, on, the, maternal, line, of, descent, see, mitochondrial, eve, due, to, the, damage, induced, by, the, exposure, to, reactive, oxygen, species, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, has, a, more, rapid, rate, of, variation, than, nuclear, dna, this, 20, fold, higher, mutation, rate, allows, mtdna, to, be, used, for, more, accurate, tracing, of, maternal, ancestry, studies, of, mtdna, in, populations, have, allowed, ancient, migration, paths, to, be, traced, such, as, the, migration, of, native, americans, from, siberia, or, polynesians, from, southeastern, asia, it, has, also, been, used, to, show, that, there, is, no, trace, of, neanderthal, dna, in, the, european, gene, mixture, inherited, through, purely, maternal, lineage, due, to, the, restrictive, all, or, none, manner, of, mtdna, inheritance, this, result, no, trace, of, neanderthal, mtdna, would, be, likely, unless, there, were, a, large, percentage, of, neanderthal, ancestry, or, there, was, strong, positive, selection, for, that, mtdna, for, example, going, back, 5, generations, only, 1, of, a, person, s, 32, ancestors, contributed, to, that, person, s, mtdna, so, if, one, of, these, 32, was, pure, neanderthal, an, expected, 3, of, that, person, s, autosomal, dna, would, be, of, neanderthal, origin, yet, they, would, have, a, 97, chance, of, having, no, trace, of, neanderthal, mtdna, epigenetics, describes, a, variety, of, features, of, the, human, genome, that, transcend, its, primary, dna, sequence, such, as, chromatin, packaging, histone, modifications, and, dna, methylation, and, which, are, important, in, regulating, gene, expression, genome, replication, and, other, cellular, processes, epigenetic, markers, strengthen, and, weaken, transcription, of, certain, genes, but, do, not, affect, the, actual, sequence, of, dna, nucleotides, dna, methylation, is, a, major, form, of, epigenetic, control, over, gene, expression, and, one, of, the, most, highly, studied, topics, in, epigenetics, during, development, the, human, dna, methylation, profile, experiences, dramatic, changes, in, early, germ, line, cells, the, genome, has, very, low, methylation, levels, these, low, levels, generally, describe, active, genes, as, development, progresses, parental, imprinting, tags, lead, to, increased, methylation, activity, epigenetic, patterns, can, be, identified, between, tissues, within, an, individual, as, well, as, between, individuals, themselves, identical, genes, that, have, differences, only, in, their, epigenetic, state, are, called, epialleles, epialleles, can, be, placed, into, three, categories, those, directly, determined, by, an, individual, s, genotype, those, influenced, by, genotype, and, those, entirely, independent, of, genotype, the, epigenome, is, also, influenced, significantly, by, environmental, factors, diet, toxins, and, hormones, impact, the, epigenetic, state, studies, in, dietary, manipulation, have, demonstrated, that, methyl, deficient, diets, are, associated, with, hypomethylation, of, the, epigenome, such, studies, establish, epigenetics, as, an, important, interface, between, the, environment, and, the, genome
