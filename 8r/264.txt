in, molecular, biology, dna, replication, is, the, biological, process, of, producing, two, identical, replicas, of, dna, from, one, original, dna, molecule, dna, replication, occurs, in, all, living, organisms, acting, as, the, most, essential, part, of, biological, inheritance, this, is, essential, for, cell, division, during, growth, and, repair, of, damaged, tissues, while, it, also, ensures, that, each, of, the, new, cells, receives, its, own, copy, of, the, dna, the, cell, possesses, the, distinctive, property, of, division, which, makes, replication, of, dna, essential, dna, is, made, up, of, a, double, helix, of, two, complementary, strands, the, double, helix, describes, the, appearance, of, a, double, stranded, dna, which, is, thus, composed, of, two, linear, strands, that, run, opposite, to, each, other, and, twist, together, to, form, during, replication, these, strands, are, separated, each, strand, of, the, original, dna, molecule, then, serves, as, a, template, for, the, production, of, its, counterpart, a, process, referred, to, as, semiconservative, replication, as, a, result, of, semi, conservative, replication, the, new, helix, will, be, composed, of, an, original, dna, strand, as, well, as, a, newly, synthesized, strand, cellular, proofreading, and, error, checking, mechanisms, ensure, near, perfect, fidelity, for, dna, replication, in, a, cell, dna, replication, begins, at, specific, locations, or, origins, of, replication, in, the, genome, which, contains, the, genetic, material, of, an, organism, unwinding, of, dna, at, the, origin, and, synthesis, of, new, strands, accommodated, by, an, enzyme, known, as, helicase, results, in, replication, forks, growing, bi, directionally, from, the, origin, a, number, of, proteins, are, associated, with, the, replication, fork, to, help, in, the, initiation, and, continuation, of, dna, synthesis, most, prominently, dna, polymerase, synthesizes, the, new, strands, by, adding, nucleotides, that, complement, each, template, strand, dna, replication, occurs, during, the, s, stage, of, interphase, dna, replication, dna, amplification, can, also, be, performed, in, vitro, artificially, outside, a, cell, dna, polymerases, isolated, from, cells, and, artificial, dna, primers, can, be, used, to, start, dna, synthesis, at, known, sequences, in, a, template, dna, molecule, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, ligase, chain, reaction, lcr, and, transcription, mediated, amplification, tma, are, examples, in, march, 2021, researchers, reported, evidence, suggesting, that, a, preliminary, form, of, transfer, rna, a, necessary, component, of, translation, the, biological, synthesis, of, new, proteins, in, accordance, with, the, genetic, code, could, have, been, a, replicator, molecule, itself, in, the, very, early, development, of, life, or, abiogenesis, dna, exists, as, a, double, stranded, structure, with, both, strands, coiled, together, to, form, the, characteristic, double, helix, each, single, strand, of, dna, is, a, chain, of, four, types, of, nucleotides, nucleotides, in, dna, contain, a, deoxyribose, sugar, a, phosphate, and, a, nucleobase, the, four, types, of, nucleotide, correspond, to, the, four, nucleobases, adenine, cytosine, guanine, and, thymine, commonly, abbreviated, as, a, c, g, and, t, adenine, and, guanine, are, purine, bases, while, cytosine, and, thymine, are, pyrimidines, these, nucleotides, form, phosphodiester, bonds, creating, the, phosphate, deoxyribose, backbone, of, the, dna, double, helix, with, the, nucleobases, pointing, inward, i, e, toward, the, opposing, strand, nucleobases, are, matched, between, strands, through, hydrogen, bonds, to, form, base, pairs, adenine, pairs, with, thymine, two, hydrogen, bonds, and, guanine, pairs, with, cytosine, three, hydrogen, bonds, dna, strands, have, a, directionality, and, the, different, ends, of, a, single, strand, are, called, the, 3, three, prime, end, and, the, 5, five, prime, end, by, convention, if, the, base, sequence, of, a, single, strand, of, dna, is, given, the, left, end, of, the, sequence, is, the, 5, end, while, the, right, end, of, the, sequence, is, the, 3, end, the, strands, of, the, double, helix, are, anti, parallel, with, one, being, 5, to, 3, and, the, opposite, strand, 3, to, 5, these, terms, refer, to, the, carbon, atom, in, deoxyribose, to, which, the, next, phosphate, in, the, chain, attaches, directionality, has, consequences, in, dna, synthesis, because, dna, polymerase, can, synthesize, dna, in, only, one, direction, by, adding, nucleotides, to, the, 3, end, of, a, dna, strand, the, pairing, of, complementary, bases, in, dna, through, hydrogen, bonding, means, that, the, information, contained, within, each, strand, is, redundant, phosphodiester, intra, strand, bonds, are, stronger, than, hydrogen, inter, strand, bonds, the, actual, job, of, the, phosphodiester, bonds, is, where, in, dna, polymers, connect, the, 5, carbon, atom, of, one, nucleotide, to, the, 3, carbon, atom, of, another, nucleotide, while, the, hydrogen, bonds, stabilize, dna, double, helices, across, the, helix, axis, but, not, in, the, direction, of, the, axis, this, makes, it, possible, to, separate, the, strands, from, one, another, the, nucleotides, on, a, single, strand, can, therefore, be, used, to, reconstruct, nucleotides, on, a, newly, synthesized, partner, strand, dna, polymerases, are, a, family, of, enzymes, that, carry, out, all, forms, of, dna, replication, dna, polymerases, in, general, cannot, initiate, synthesis, of, new, strands, but, can, only, extend, an, existing, dna, or, rna, strand, paired, with, a, template, strand, to, begin, synthesis, a, short, fragment, of, rna, called, a, primer, must, be, created, and, paired, with, the, template, dna, strand, dna, polymerase, adds, a, new, strand, of, dna, by, extending, the, 3, end, of, an, existing, nucleotide, chain, adding, new, nucleotides, matched, to, the, template, strand, one, at, a, time, via, the, creation, of, phosphodiester, bonds, the, energy, for, this, process, of, dna, polymerization, comes, from, hydrolysis, of, the, high, energy, phosphate, phosphoanhydride, bonds, between, the, three, phosphates, attached, to, each, unincorporated, base, free, bases, with, their, attached, phosphate, groups, are, called, nucleotides, in, particular, bases, with, three, attached, phosphate, groups, are, called, nucleoside, triphosphates, when, a, nucleotide, is, being, added, to, a, growing, dna, strand, the, formation, of, a, phosphodiester, bond, between, the, proximal, phosphate, of, the, nucleotide, to, the, growing, chain, is, accompanied, by, hydrolysis, of, a, high, energy, phosphate, bond, with, release, of, the, two, distal, phosphate, groups, as, a, pyrophosphate, enzymatic, hydrolysis, of, the, resulting, pyrophosphate, into, inorganic, phosphate, consumes, a, second, high, energy, phosphate, bond, and, renders, the, reaction, effectively, irreversible, in, general, dna, polymerases, are, highly, accurate, with, an, intrinsic, error, rate, of, less, than, one, mistake, for, every, 10, 7, nucleotides, added, some, dna, polymerases, can, also, delete, nucleotides, from, the, end, of, a, developing, strand, in, order, to, fix, mismatched, bases, this, is, known, as, proofreading, finally, post, replication, mismatch, repair, mechanisms, monitor, the, dna, for, errors, being, capable, of, distinguishing, mismatches, in, the, newly, synthesized, dna, strand, from, the, original, strand, sequence, together, these, three, discrimination, steps, enable, replication, fidelity, of, less, than, one, mistake, for, every, 10, 9, nucleotides, added, the, rate, of, dna, replication, in, a, living, cell, was, first, measured, as, the, rate, of, phage, t4, dna, elongation, in, phage, infected, e, coli, during, the, period, of, exponential, dna, increase, at, 37, c, the, rate, was, 749, nucleotides, per, second, the, mutation, rate, per, base, pair, per, replication, during, phage, t4, dna, synthesis, is, 1, 7, per, 10, 8, dna, replication, like, all, biological, polymerization, processes, proceeds, in, three, enzymatically, catalyzed, and, coordinated, steps, initiation, elongation, and, termination, for, a, cell, to, divide, it, must, first, replicate, its, dna, dna, replication, is, an, all, or, none, process, once, replication, begins, it, proceeds, to, completion, once, replication, is, complete, it, does, not, occur, again, in, the, same, cell, cycle, this, is, made, possible, by, the, division, of, initiation, of, the, pre, replication, complex, in, late, mitosis, and, early, g1, phase, a, large, complex, of, initiator, proteins, assembles, into, the, pre, replication, complex, at, particular, points, in, the, dna, known, as, origins, in, e, coli, the, primary, initiator, protein, is, dna, a, in, yeast, this, is, the, origin, recognition, complex, sequences, used, by, initiator, proteins, tend, to, be, at, rich, rich, in, adenine, and, thymine, bases, because, a, t, base, pairs, have, two, hydrogen, bonds, rather, than, the, three, formed, in, a, c, g, pair, and, thus, are, easier, to, strand, separate, in, eukaryotes, the, origin, recognition, complex, catalyzes, the, assembly, of, initiator, proteins, into, the, pre, replication, complex, in, addition, a, recent, report, suggests, that, budding, yeast, orc, dimerizes, in, a, cell, cycle, dependent, manner, to, control, licensing, in, turn, the, process, of, orc, dimerization, is, mediated, by, a, cell, cycle, dependent, noc3p, dimerization, cycle, in, vivo, and, this, role, of, noc3p, is, separable, from, its, role, in, ribosome, biogenesis, an, essential, noc3p, dimerization, cycle, mediates, orc, double, hexamer, formation, in, replication, licensing, orc, and, noc3p, are, continuously, bound, to, the, chromatin, throughout, the, cell, cycle, cdc6, and, cdt1, then, associate, with, the, bound, origin, recognition, complex, at, the, origin, in, order, to, form, a, larger, complex, necessary, to, load, the, mcm, complex, onto, the, dna, in, eukaryotes, the, mcm, complex, is, the, helicase, that, will, split, the, dna, helix, at, the, replication, forks, and, origins, the, mcm, complex, is, recruited, at, late, g1, phase, and, loaded, by, the, orc, cdc6, cdt1, complex, onto, the, dna, via, atp, dependent, protein, remodeling, the, loading, of, the, mcm, complex, onto, the, origin, dna, marks, the, completion, of, pre, replication, complex, formation, if, environmental, conditions, are, right, in, late, g1, phase, the, g1, and, g1, s, cyclin, cdk, complexes, are, activated, which, stimulate, expression, of, genes, that, encode, components, of, the, dna, synthetic, machinery, g1, s, cdk, activation, also, promotes, the, expression, and, activation, of, s, cdk, complexes, which, may, play, a, role, in, activating, replication, origins, depending, on, species, and, cell, type, control, of, these, cdks, vary, depending, on, cell, type, and, stage, of, development, this, regulation, is, best, understood, in, budding, yeast, where, the, s, cyclins, clb5, and, clb6, are, primarily, responsible, for, dna, replication, clb5, 6, cdk1, complexes, directly, trigger, the, activation, of, replication, origins, and, are, therefore, required, throughout, s, phase, to, directly, activate, each, origin, in, a, similar, manner, cdc7, is, also, required, through, s, phase, to, activate, replication, origins, cdc7, is, not, active, throughout, the, cell, cycle, and, its, activation, is, strictly, timed, to, avoid, premature, initiation, of, dna, replication, in, late, g1, cdc7, activity, rises, abruptly, as, a, result, of, association, with, the, regulatory, subunit, dbf4, which, binds, cdc7, directly, and, promotes, its, protein, kinase, activity, cdc7, has, been, found, to, be, a, rate, limiting, regulator, of, origin, activity, together, the, g1, s, cdks, and, or, s, cdks, and, cdc7, collaborate, to, directly, activate, the, replication, origins, leading, to, initiation, of, dna, synthesis, in, early, s, phase, s, cdk, and, cdc7, activation, lead, to, the, assembly, of, the, preinitiation, complex, a, massive, protein, complex, formed, at, the, origin, formation, of, the, preinitiation, complex, displaces, cdc6, and, cdt1, from, the, origin, replication, complex, inactivating, and, disassembling, the, pre, replication, complex, loading, the, preinitiation, complex, onto, the, origin, activates, the, mcm, helicase, causing, unwinding, of, the, dna, helix, the, preinitiation, complex, also, loads, primase, and, other, dna, polymerases, onto, the, dna, after, primase, synthesizes, the, first, primers, the, primer, template, junctions, interact, with, the, clamp, loader, which, loads, the, sliding, clamp, onto, the, dna, to, begin, dna, synthesis, the, components, of, the, preinitiation, complex, remain, associated, with, replication, forks, as, they, move, out, from, the, origin, dna, polymerase, has, 5, 3, activity, all, known, dna, replication, systems, require, a, free, 3, hydroxyl, group, before, synthesis, can, be, initiated, note, the, dna, template, is, read, in, 3, to, 5, direction, whereas, a, new, strand, is, synthesized, in, the, 5, to, 3, direction, this, is, often, confused, four, distinct, mechanisms, for, dna, synthesis, are, recognized, cellular, organisms, use, the, first, of, these, pathways, since, it, is, the, most, well, known, in, this, mechanism, once, the, two, strands, are, separated, primase, adds, rna, primers, to, the, template, strands, the, leading, strand, receives, one, rna, primer, while, the, lagging, strand, receives, several, the, leading, strand, is, continuously, extended, from, the, primer, by, a, dna, polymerase, with, high, processivity, while, the, lagging, strand, is, extended, discontinuously, from, each, primer, forming, okazaki, fragments, rnase, removes, the, primer, rna, fragments, and, a, low, processivity, dna, polymerase, distinct, from, the, replicative, polymerase, enters, to, fill, the, gaps, when, this, is, complete, a, single, nick, on, the, leading, strand, and, several, nicks, on, the, lagging, strand, can, be, found, ligase, works, to, fill, these, nicks, in, thus, completing, the, newly, replicated, dna, molecule, the, primase, used, in, this, process, differs, significantly, between, bacteria, and, archaea, eukaryotes, bacteria, use, a, primase, belonging, to, the, dnag, protein, superfamily, which, contains, a, catalytic, domain, of, the, toprim, fold, type, the, toprim, fold, contains, an, core, with, four, conserved, strands, in, a, rossmann, like, topology, this, structure, is, also, found, in, the, catalytic, domains, of, topoisomerase, ia, topoisomerase, ii, the, old, family, nucleases, and, dna, repair, proteins, related, to, the, recr, protein, the, primase, used, by, archaea, and, eukaryotes, in, contrast, contains, a, highly, derived, version, of, the, rna, recognition, motif, rrm, this, primase, is, structurally, similar, to, many, viral, rna, dependent, rna, polymerases, reverse, transcriptases, cyclic, nucleotide, generating, cyclases, and, dna, polymerases, of, the, a, b, y, families, that, are, involved, in, dna, replication, and, repair, in, eukaryotic, replication, the, primase, forms, a, complex, with, pol, multiple, dna, polymerases, take, on, different, roles, in, the, dna, replication, process, in, e, coli, dna, pol, iii, is, the, polymerase, enzyme, primarily, responsible, for, dna, replication, it, assembles, into, a, replication, complex, at, the, replication, fork, that, exhibits, extremely, high, processivity, remaining, intact, for, the, entire, replication, cycle, in, contrast, dna, pol, i, is, the, enzyme, responsible, for, replacing, rna, primers, with, dna, dna, pol, i, has, a, 5, to, 3, exonuclease, activity, in, addition, to, its, polymerase, activity, and, uses, its, exonuclease, activity, to, degrade, the, rna, primers, ahead, of, it, as, it, extends, the, dna, strand, behind, it, in, a, process, called, nick, translation, pol, i, is, much, less, processive, than, pol, iii, because, its, primary, function, in, dna, replication, is, to, create, many, short, dna, regions, rather, than, a, few, very, long, regions, in, eukaryotes, the, low, processivity, enzyme, pol, helps, to, initiate, replication, because, it, forms, a, complex, with, primase, in, eukaryotes, leading, strand, synthesis, is, thought, to, be, conducted, by, pol, however, this, view, has, recently, been, challenged, suggesting, a, role, for, pol, primer, removal, is, completed, pol, while, repair, of, dna, during, replication, is, completed, by, pol, as, dna, synthesis, continues, the, original, dna, strands, continue, to, unwind, on, each, side, of, the, bubble, forming, a, replication, fork, with, two, prongs, in, bacteria, which, have, a, single, origin, of, replication, on, their, circular, chromosome, this, process, creates, a, theta, structure, resembling, the, greek, letter, theta, in, contrast, eukaryotes, have, longer, linear, chromosomes, and, initiate, replication, at, multiple, origins, within, these, the, replication, fork, is, a, structure, that, forms, within, the, long, helical, dna, during, dna, replication, it, is, produced, by, enzymes, called, helicases, that, break, the, hydrogen, bonds, that, hold, the, dna, strands, together, in, a, helix, the, resulting, structure, has, two, branching, prongs, each, one, made, up, of, a, single, strand, of, dna, these, two, strands, serve, as, the, template, for, the, leading, and, lagging, strands, which, will, be, created, as, dna, polymerase, matches, complementary, nucleotides, to, the, templates, the, templates, may, be, properly, referred, to, as, the, leading, strand, template, and, the, lagging, strand, template, dna, is, read, by, dna, polymerase, in, the, 3, to, 5, direction, meaning, the, new, strand, is, synthesized, in, the, 5, to, 3, direction, since, the, leading, and, lagging, strand, templates, are, oriented, in, opposite, directions, at, the, replication, fork, a, major, issue, is, how, to, achieve, synthesis, of, new, lagging, strand, dna, whose, direction, of, synthesis, is, opposite, to, the, direction, of, the, growing, replication, fork, the, leading, strand, is, the, strand, of, new, dna, which, is, synthesized, in, the, same, direction, as, the, growing, replication, fork, this, sort, of, dna, replication, is, continuous, the, lagging, strand, is, the, strand, of, new, dna, whose, direction, of, synthesis, is, opposite, to, the, direction, of, the, growing, replication, fork, because, of, its, orientation, replication, of, the, lagging, strand, is, more, complicated, as, compared, to, that, of, the, leading, strand, as, a, consequence, the, dna, polymerase, on, this, strand, is, seen, to, lag, behind, the, other, strand, the, lagging, strand, is, synthesized, in, short, separated, segments, on, the, lagging, strand, template, a, primase, reads, the, template, dna, and, initiates, synthesis, of, a, short, complementary, rna, primer, a, dna, polymerase, extends, the, primed, segments, forming, okazaki, fragments, the, rna, primers, are, then, removed, and, replaced, with, dna, and, the, fragments, of, dna, are, joined, by, dna, ligase, in, all, cases, the, helicase, is, composed, of, six, polypeptides, that, wrap, around, only, one, strand, of, the, dna, being, replicated, the, two, polymerases, are, bound, to, the, helicase, hexamer, in, eukaryotes, the, helicase, wraps, around, the, leading, strand, and, in, prokaryotes, it, wraps, around, the, lagging, strand, as, helicase, unwinds, dna, at, the, replication, fork, the, dna, ahead, is, forced, to, rotate, this, process, results, in, a, build, up, of, twists, in, the, dna, ahead, this, build, up, creates, a, torsional, load, that, would, eventually, stop, the, replication, fork, topoisomerases, are, enzymes, that, temporarily, break, the, strands, of, dna, relieving, the, tension, caused, by, unwinding, the, two, strands, of, the, dna, helix, topoisomerases, including, dna, gyrase, achieve, this, by, adding, negative, supercoils, to, the, dna, helix, bare, single, stranded, dna, tends, to, fold, back, on, itself, forming, secondary, structures, these, structures, can, interfere, with, the, movement, of, dna, polymerase, to, prevent, this, single, strand, binding, proteins, bind, to, the, dna, until, a, second, strand, is, synthesized, preventing, secondary, structure, formation, double, stranded, dna, is, coiled, around, histones, that, play, an, important, role, in, regulating, gene, expression, so, the, replicated, dna, must, be, coiled, around, histones, at, the, same, places, as, the, original, dna, to, ensure, this, histone, chaperones, disassemble, the, chromatin, before, it, is, replicated, and, replace, the, histones, in, the, correct, place, some, steps, in, this, reassembly, are, somewhat, speculative, clamp, proteins, act, as, a, sliding, clamp, on, dna, allowing, the, dna, polymerase, to, bind, to, its, template, and, aid, in, processivity, the, inner, face, of, the, clamp, enables, dna, to, be, threaded, through, it, once, the, polymerase, reaches, the, end, of, the, template, or, detects, double, stranded, dna, the, sliding, clamp, undergoes, a, conformational, change, that, releases, the, dna, polymerase, clamp, loading, proteins, are, used, to, initially, load, the, clamp, recognizing, the, junction, between, template, and, rna, primers, 274, 5, at, the, replication, fork, many, replication, enzymes, assemble, on, the, dna, into, a, complex, molecular, machine, called, the, replisome, the, following, is, a, list, of, major, dna, replication, enzymes, that, participate, in, the, replisome, in, vitro, single, molecule, experiments, using, optical, tweezers, and, magnetic, tweezers, have, found, synergetic, interactions, between, the, replisome, enzymes, helicase, polymerase, and, single, strand, dna, binding, protein, and, with, the, dna, replication, fork, enhancing, dna, unwinding, and, dna, replication, these, results, lead, to, the, development, of, kinetic, models, accounting, for, the, synergetic, interactions, and, their, stability, replication, machineries, consist, of, factors, involved, in, dna, replication, and, appearing, on, template, ssdnas, replication, machineries, include, primosotors, are, replication, enzymes, dna, polymerase, dna, helicases, dna, clamps, and, dna, topoisomerases, and, replication, proteins, e, g, single, stranded, dna, binding, proteins, ssb, in, the, replication, machineries, these, components, coordinate, in, most, of, the, bacteria, all, of, the, factors, involved, in, dna, replication, are, located, on, replication, forks, and, the, complexes, stay, on, the, forks, during, dna, replication, replication, machineries, are, also, referred, to, as, replisomes, or, dna, replication, systems, these, terms, are, generic, terms, for, proteins, located, on, replication, forks, in, eukaryotic, and, some, bacterial, cells, the, replisomes, are, not, formed, replication, factories, disentangle, sister, chromatids, the, disentanglement, is, essential, for, distributing, the, chromatids, into, daughter, cells, after, dna, replication, because, sister, chromatids, after, dna, replication, hold, each, other, by, cohesin, rings, there, is, the, only, chance, for, the, disentanglement, in, dna, replication, fixing, of, replication, machineries, as, replication, factories, can, improve, the, success, rate, of, dna, replication, if, replication, forks, move, freely, in, chromosomes, catenation, of, nuclei, is, aggravated, and, impedes, mitotic, segregation, eukaryotes, initiate, dna, replication, at, multiple, points, in, the, chromosome, so, replication, forks, meet, and, terminate, at, many, points, in, the, chromosome, because, eukaryotes, have, linear, chromosomes, dna, replication, is, unable, to, reach, the, very, end, of, the, chromosomes, due, to, this, problem, dna, is, lost, in, each, replication, cycle, from, the, end, of, the, chromosome, telomeres, are, regions, of, repetitive, dna, close, to, the, ends, and, help, prevent, loss, of, genes, due, to, this, shortening, shortening, of, the, telomeres, is, a, normal, process, in, somatic, cells, this, shortens, the, telomeres, of, the, daughter, dna, chromosome, as, a, result, cells, can, only, divide, a, certain, number, of, times, before, the, dna, loss, prevents, further, division, this, is, known, as, the, hayflick, limit, within, the, germ, cell, line, which, passes, dna, to, the, next, generation, telomerase, extends, the, repetitive, sequences, of, the, telomere, region, to, prevent, degradation, telomerase, can, become, mistakenly, active, in, somatic, cells, sometimes, leading, to, cancer, formation, increased, telomerase, activity, is, one, of, the, hallmarks, of, cancer, termination, requires, that, the, progress, of, the, dna, replication, fork, must, stop, or, be, blocked, termination, at, a, specific, locus, when, it, occurs, involves, the, interaction, between, two, components, 1, a, termination, site, sequence, in, the, dna, and, 2, a, protein, which, binds, to, this, sequence, to, physically, stop, dna, replication, in, various, bacterial, species, this, is, named, the, dna, replication, terminus, site, binding, protein, or, ter, protein, because, bacteria, have, circular, chromosomes, termination, of, replication, occurs, when, the, two, replication, forks, meet, each, other, on, the, opposite, end, of, the, parental, chromosome, e, coli, regulates, this, process, through, the, use, of, termination, sequences, that, when, bound, by, the, tus, protein, enable, only, one, direction, of, replication, fork, to, pass, through, as, a, result, the, replication, forks, are, constrained, to, always, meet, within, the, termination, region, of, the, chromosome, within, eukaryotes, dna, replication, is, controlled, within, the, context, of, the, cell, cycle, as, the, cell, grows, and, divides, it, progresses, through, stages, in, the, cell, cycle, dna, replication, takes, place, during, the, s, phase, synthesis, phase, the, progress, of, the, eukaryotic, cell, through, the, cycle, is, controlled, by, cell, cycle, checkpoints, progression, through, checkpoints, is, controlled, through, complex, interactions, between, various, proteins, including, cyclins, and, cyclin, dependent, kinases, unlike, bacteria, eukaryotic, dna, replicates, in, the, confines, of, the, nucleus, the, g1, s, checkpoint, restriction, checkpoint, regulates, whether, eukaryotic, cells, enter, the, process, of, dna, replication, and, subsequent, division, cells, that, do, not, proceed, through, this, checkpoint, remain, in, the, g0, stage, and, do, not, replicate, their, dna, once, the, dna, has, gone, through, the, g1, s, test, it, can, only, be, copied, once, in, every, cell, cycle, when, the, mcm, complex, moves, away, from, the, origin, the, pre, replication, complex, is, dismantled, because, a, new, mcm, complex, cannot, be, loaded, at, an, origin, until, the, pre, replication, subunits, are, reactivated, one, origin, of, replication, can, not, be, used, twice, in, the, same, cell, cycle, activation, of, s, cdks, in, early, s, phase, promotes, the, destruction, or, inhibition, of, individual, pre, replication, complex, components, preventing, immediate, reassembly, s, and, m, cdks, continue, to, block, pre, replication, complex, assembly, even, after, s, phase, is, complete, ensuring, that, assembly, cannot, occur, again, until, all, cdk, activity, is, reduced, in, late, mitosis, in, budding, yeast, inhibition, of, assembly, is, caused, by, cdk, dependent, phosphorylation, of, pre, replication, complex, components, at, the, onset, of, s, phase, phosphorylation, of, cdc6, by, cdk1, causes, the, binding, of, cdc6, to, the, scf, ubiquitin, protein, ligase, which, causes, proteolytic, destruction, of, cdc6, cdk, dependent, phosphorylation, of, mcm, proteins, promotes, their, export, out, of, the, nucleus, along, with, cdt1, during, s, phase, preventing, the, loading, of, new, mcm, complexes, at, origins, during, a, single, cell, cycle, cdk, phosphorylation, of, the, origin, replication, complex, also, inhibits, pre, replication, complex, assembly, the, individual, presence, of, any, of, these, three, mechanisms, is, sufficient, to, inhibit, pre, replication, complex, assembly, however, mutations, of, all, three, proteins, in, the, same, cell, does, trigger, reinitiation, at, many, origins, of, replication, within, one, cell, cycle, in, animal, cells, the, protein, geminin, is, a, key, inhibitor, of, pre, replication, complex, assembly, geminin, binds, cdt1, preventing, its, binding, to, the, origin, recognition, complex, in, g1, levels, of, geminin, are, kept, low, by, the, apc, which, ubiquitinates, geminin, to, target, it, for, degradation, when, geminin, is, destroyed, cdt1, is, released, allowing, it, to, function, in, pre, replication, complex, assembly, at, the, end, of, g1, the, apc, is, inactivated, allowing, geminin, to, accumulate, and, bind, cdt1, replication, of, chloroplast, and, mitochondrial, genomes, occurs, independently, of, the, cell, cycle, through, the, process, of, d, loop, replication, in, vertebrate, cells, replication, sites, concentrate, into, positions, called, replication, foci, replication, sites, can, be, detected, by, immunostaining, daughter, strands, and, replication, enzymes, and, monitoring, gfp, tagged, replication, factors, by, these, methods, it, is, found, that, replication, foci, of, varying, size, and, positions, appear, in, s, phase, of, cell, division, and, their, number, per, nucleus, is, far, smaller, than, the, number, of, genomic, replication, forks, p, heun, et, al, 2001, tracked, gfp, tagged, replication, foci, in, budding, yeast, cells, and, revealed, that, replication, origins, move, constantly, in, g1, and, s, phase, and, the, dynamics, decreased, significantly, in, s, phase, traditionally, replication, sites, were, fixed, on, spatial, structure, of, chromosomes, by, nuclear, matrix, or, lamins, the, heun, s, results, denied, the, traditional, concepts, budding, yeasts, do, not, have, lamins, and, support, that, replication, origins, self, assemble, and, form, replication, foci, by, firing, of, replication, origins, controlled, spatially, and, temporally, the, formation, of, replication, foci, is, regulated, d, a, jackson, et, al, 1998, revealed, that, neighboring, origins, fire, simultaneously, in, mammalian, cells, spatial, juxtaposition, of, replication, sites, brings, clustering, of, replication, forks, the, clustering, do, rescue, of, stalled, replication, forks, and, favors, normal, progress, of, replication, forks, progress, of, replication, forks, is, inhibited, by, many, factors, collision, with, proteins, or, with, complexes, binding, strongly, on, dna, deficiency, of, dntps, nicks, on, template, dnas, and, so, on, if, replication, forks, get, stuck, and, the, rest, of, the, sequences, from, the, stuck, forks, are, not, copied, then, the, daughter, strands, get, nick, nick, unreplicated, sites, the, un, replicated, sites, on, one, parent, s, strand, hold, the, other, strand, together, but, not, daughter, strands, therefore, the, resulting, sister, chromatids, cannot, separate, from, each, other, and, cannot, divide, into, 2, daughter, cells, when, neighboring, origins, fire, and, a, fork, from, one, origin, is, stalled, fork, from, other, origin, access, on, an, opposite, direction, of, the, stalled, fork, and, duplicate, the, un, replicated, sites, as, other, mechanism, of, the, rescue, there, is, application, of, dormant, replication, origins, that, excess, origins, do, not, fire, in, normal, dna, replication, most, bacteria, do, not, go, through, a, well, defined, cell, cycle, but, instead, continuously, copy, their, dna, during, rapid, growth, this, can, result, in, the, concurrent, occurrence, of, multiple, rounds, of, replication, in, e, coli, the, best, characterized, bacteria, dna, replication, is, regulated, through, several, mechanisms, including, the, hemimethylation, and, sequestering, of, the, origin, sequence, the, ratio, of, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, to, adenosine, diphosphate, adp, and, the, levels, of, protein, dnaa, all, these, control, the, binding, of, initiator, proteins, to, the, origin, sequences, because, e, coli, methylates, gatc, dna, sequences, dna, synthesis, results, in, hemimethylated, sequences, this, hemimethylated, dna, is, recognized, by, the, protein, seqa, which, binds, and, sequesters, the, origin, sequence, in, addition, dnaa, required, for, initiation, of, replication, binds, less, well, to, hemimethylated, dna, as, a, result, newly, replicated, origins, are, prevented, from, immediately, initiating, another, round, of, dna, replication, atp, builds, up, when, the, cell, is, in, a, rich, medium, triggering, dna, replication, once, the, cell, has, reached, a, specific, size, atp, competes, with, adp, to, bind, to, dnaa, and, the, dnaa, atp, complex, is, able, to, initiate, replication, a, certain, number, of, dnaa, proteins, are, also, required, for, dna, replication, each, time, the, origin, is, copied, the, number, of, binding, sites, for, dnaa, doubles, requiring, the, synthesis, of, more, dnaa, to, enable, another, initiation, of, replication, in, fast, growing, bacteria, such, as, e, coli, chromosome, replication, takes, more, time, than, dividing, the, cell, the, bacteria, solve, this, by, initiating, a, new, round, of, replication, before, the, previous, one, has, been, terminated, the, new, round, of, replication, will, form, the, chromosome, of, the, cell, that, is, born, two, generations, after, the, dividing, cell, this, mechanism, creates, overlapping, replication, cycles, there, are, many, events, that, contribute, to, replication, stress, including, researchers, commonly, replicate, dna, in, vitro, using, the, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, pcr, uses, a, pair, of, primers, to, span, a, target, region, in, template, dna, and, then, polymerizes, partner, strands, in, each, direction, from, these, primers, using, a, thermostable, dna, polymerase, repeating, this, process, through, multiple, cycles, amplifies, the, targeted, dna, region, at, the, start, of, each, cycle, the, mixture, of, template, and, primers, is, heated, separating, the, newly, synthesized, molecule, and, template, then, as, the, mixture, cools, both, of, these, become, templates, for, annealing, of, new, primers, and, the, polymerase, extends, from, these, as, a, result, the, number, of, copies, of, the, target, region, doubles, each, round, increasing, exponentially
