sea, cucumbers, are, echinoderms, from, the, class, holothuroidea, h, l, j, r, d, i, h, o, hol, thure, oy, dee, hohl, they, are, marine, animals, with, a, leathery, skin, and, an, elongated, body, containing, a, single, branched, gonad, they, are, found, on, the, sea, floor, worldwide, the, number, of, known, holothurian, h, l, j, r, i, n, h, o, hol, thure, ee, n, hohl, species, worldwide, is, about, 1, 786, with, the, greatest, number, being, in, the, asia, pacific, region, many, of, these, are, gathered, for, human, consumption, and, some, species, are, cultivated, in, aquaculture, systems, the, harvested, product, is, variously, referred, to, as, trepang, namako, b, che, de, mer, or, balate, sea, cucumbers, serve, a, useful, role, in, the, marine, ecosystem, as, they, help, recycle, nutrients, breaking, down, detritus, and, other, organic, matter, after, which, bacteria, can, continue, the, decomposition, process, like, all, echinoderms, sea, cucumbers, have, an, endoskeleton, just, below, the, skin, calcified, structures, that, are, usually, reduced, to, isolated, microscopic, ossicles, or, sclerietes, joined, by, connective, tissue, in, some, species, these, can, sometimes, be, enlarged, to, flattened, plates, forming, an, armour, in, pelagic, species, such, as, pelagothuria, natatrix, order, elasipodida, family, pelagothuriidae, the, skeleton, is, absent, and, there, is, no, calcareous, ring, sea, cucumbers, are, named, for, their, resemblance, to, the, fruit, of, the, cucumber, plant, most, sea, cucumbers, have, a, soft, and, cylindrical, body, rounded, off, and, occasionally, fat, in, the, extremities, and, generally, without, solid, appendages, their, shape, ranges, from, almost, spherical, for, sea, apples, genus, pseudocolochirus, to, serpent, like, for, apodida, or, the, classic, sausage, shape, while, others, resemble, caterpillars, the, mouth, is, surrounded, by, tentacles, which, can, be, pulled, back, inside, the, animal, holothurians, measure, generally, between, 10, and, 30, centimetres, 3, 9, and, 11, 8, in, long, with, extremes, of, some, millimetres, for, rhabdomolgus, ruber, and, up, to, more, than, 3, metres, 9, 8, ft, for, synapta, maculata, the, largest, american, species, holothuria, floridana, which, abounds, just, below, low, water, mark, on, the, florida, reefs, has, a, volume, of, well, over, 500, cubic, centimeters, 31, cu, in, and, 25, 30, cm, 10, 12, in, long, most, possess, five, rows, of, tube, feet, called, podia, but, apodida, lacks, these, and, moves, by, crawling, the, podia, can, be, of, smooth, aspect, or, provided, with, fleshy, appendages, like, thelenota, ananas, the, podia, on, the, dorsal, surface, generally, have, no, locomotive, role, and, are, transformed, into, papillae, at, one, of, the, extremities, opens, a, rounded, mouth, generally, surrounded, with, a, crown, of, tentacles, which, can, be, very, complex, in, some, species, they, are, in, fact, modified, podia, the, anus, is, postero, dorsal, holothurians, do, not, look, like, other, echinoderms, at, first, glance, because, of, their, tubular, body, without, visible, skeleton, nor, hard, appendixes, furthermore, the, fivefold, symmetry, classical, for, echinoderms, although, preserved, structurally, is, doubled, here, by, a, bilateral, symmetry, which, makes, them, look, like, chordates, however, a, central, symmetry, is, still, visible, in, some, species, through, five, radii, which, extend, from, the, mouth, to, the, anus, just, like, for, sea, urchins, on, which, the, tube, feet, are, attached, there, is, thus, no, oral, or, aboral, face, as, for, sea, stars, and, other, echinoderms, but, the, animal, stands, on, one, of, its, sides, and, this, face, is, called, trivium, with, three, rows, of, tube, feet, while, the, dorsal, face, is, named, bivium, a, remarkable, feature, of, these, animals, is, the, catch, collagen, that, forms, their, body, wall, this, can, be, loosened, and, tightened, at, will, and, if, the, animal, wants, to, squeeze, through, a, small, gap, it, can, essentially, liquefy, its, body, and, pour, into, the, space, to, keep, itself, safe, in, these, crevices, and, cracks, the, sea, cucumber, will, hook, up, all, its, collagen, fibers, to, make, its, body, firm, again, the, most, common, way, to, separate, the, subclasses, is, by, looking, at, their, oral, tentacles, order, apodida, have, a, slender, and, elongate, body, lacking, tube, feet, with, up, to, 25, simple, or, pinnate, oral, tentacles, aspidochirotida, are, the, most, common, sea, cucumbers, encountered, with, a, strong, body, and, 10, 30, leaflike, or, shield, like, oral, tentacles, dendrochirotida, are, filter, feeders, with, plump, bodies, and, 8, 30, branched, oral, tentacles, which, can, be, extremely, long, and, complex, sea, cucumbers, are, typically, 10, to, 30, cm, 4, to, 12, in, in, length, although, the, smallest, known, species, are, just, 3, mm, 0, 12, in, long, and, the, largest, can, reach, 3, meters, 10, ft, the, body, ranges, from, almost, spherical, to, worm, like, and, lacks, the, arms, found, in, many, other, echinoderms, such, as, starfish, the, anterior, end, of, the, animal, containing, the, mouth, corresponds, to, the, oral, pole, of, other, echinoderms, which, in, most, cases, is, the, underside, while, the, posterior, end, containing, the, anus, corresponds, to, the, aboral, pole, thus, compared, with, other, echinoderms, sea, cucumbers, can, be, said, to, be, lying, on, their, side, the, body, of, a, holothurian, is, roughly, cylindrical, it, is, radially, symmetrical, along, its, longitudinal, axis, and, has, weak, bilateral, symmetry, transversely, with, a, dorsal, and, a, ventral, surface, as, in, other, echinozoans, there, are, five, ambulacra, separated, by, five, ambulacral, grooves, the, interambulacra, the, ambulacral, grooves, bear, four, rows, of, tube, feet, but, these, are, diminished, in, size, or, absent, in, some, holothurians, especially, on, the, dorsal, surface, the, two, dorsal, ambulacra, make, up, the, bivium, while, the, three, ventral, ones, are, known, as, the, trivium, at, the, anterior, end, the, mouth, is, surrounded, by, a, ring, of, tentacles, which, are, usually, retractable, into, the, mouth, these, are, called, the, primary, tentacles, and, were, present, in, the, common, ancestor, of, echinoderms, but, have, been, lost, in, all, the, other, classes, of, the, phylum, and, may, be, simple, branched, or, arborescent, they, are, known, as, the, introvert, and, posterior, to, them, there, is, an, internal, ring, of, large, calcareous, ossicles, attached, to, this, are, five, bands, of, muscle, running, internally, longitudinally, along, the, ambulacra, there, are, also, circular, muscles, contraction, of, which, cause, the, animal, to, elongate, and, the, introvert, to, extend, anterior, to, the, ossicles, lie, further, muscles, contraction, of, which, cause, the, introvert, to, retract, the, body, wall, consists, of, an, epidermis, and, a, dermis, and, contains, smaller, calcareous, ossicles, the, types, of, which, are, characteristics, which, help, to, identify, different, species, inside, the, body, wall, is, the, coelom, which, is, divided, by, three, longitudinal, mesenteries, which, surround, and, support, the, internal, organs, a, pharynx, lies, behind, the, mouth, and, is, surrounded, by, a, ring, of, ten, calcareous, plates, in, most, sea, cucumbers, this, is, the, only, substantial, part, of, the, skeleton, and, it, forms, the, point, of, attachment, for, muscles, that, can, retract, the, tentacles, into, the, body, for, safety, as, for, the, main, muscles, of, the, body, wall, many, species, possess, an, oesophagus, and, stomach, but, in, some, the, pharynx, opens, directly, into, the, intestine, the, intestine, is, typically, long, and, coiled, and, loops, through, the, body, three, times, before, terminating, in, a, cloacal, chamber, or, directly, as, the, anus, sea, cucumbers, have, no, true, brain, a, ring, of, neural, tissue, surrounds, the, oral, cavity, and, sends, nerves, to, the, tentacles, and, the, pharynx, the, animal, is, however, quite, capable, of, functioning, and, moving, about, if, the, nerve, ring, is, surgically, removed, demonstrating, that, it, does, not, have, a, central, role, in, nervous, coordination, in, addition, five, major, nerves, run, from, the, nerve, ring, down, the, length, of, the, body, beneath, each, of, the, ambulacral, areas, most, sea, cucumbers, have, no, distinct, sensory, organs, although, there, are, various, nerve, endings, scattered, through, the, skin, giving, the, animal, a, sense, of, touch, and, a, sensitivity, to, the, presence, of, light, there, are, however, a, few, exceptions, members, of, the, apodida, order, are, known, to, possess, statocysts, while, some, species, possess, small, eye, spots, near, the, bases, of, their, tentacles, sea, cucumbers, extract, oxygen, from, water, in, a, pair, of, respiratory, trees, that, branch, in, the, cloaca, just, inside, the, anus, so, that, they, breathe, by, drawing, water, in, through, the, anus, and, then, expelling, it, the, trees, consist, of, a, series, of, narrow, tubules, branching, from, a, common, duct, and, lie, on, either, side, of, the, digestive, tract, gas, exchange, occurs, across, the, thin, walls, of, the, tubules, to, and, from, the, fluid, of, the, main, body, cavity, together, with, the, intestine, the, respiratory, trees, also, act, as, excretory, organs, with, nitrogenous, waste, diffusing, across, the, tubule, walls, in, the, form, of, ammonia, and, phagocytic, coelomocytes, depositing, particulate, waste, like, all, echinoderms, sea, cucumbers, possess, both, a, water, vascular, system, that, provides, hydraulic, pressure, to, the, tentacles, and, tube, feet, allowing, them, to, move, and, a, haemal, system, the, latter, is, more, complex, than, that, in, other, echinoderms, and, consists, of, well, developed, vessels, as, well, as, open, sinuses, a, central, haemal, ring, surrounds, the, pharynx, next, to, the, ring, canal, of, the, water, vascular, system, and, sends, off, additional, vessels, along, the, radial, canals, beneath, the, ambulacral, areas, in, the, larger, species, additional, vessels, run, above, and, below, the, intestine, and, are, connected, by, over, a, hundred, small, muscular, ampullae, acting, as, miniature, hearts, to, pump, blood, around, the, haemal, system, additional, vessels, surround, the, respiratory, trees, although, they, contact, them, only, indirectly, via, the, coelomic, fluid, indeed, the, blood, itself, is, essentially, identical, with, the, coelomic, fluid, that, bathes, the, organs, directly, and, also, fills, the, water, vascular, system, phagocytic, coelomocytes, somewhat, similar, in, function, to, the, white, blood, cells, of, vertebrates, are, formed, within, the, haemal, vessels, and, travel, throughout, the, body, cavity, as, well, as, both, circulatory, systems, an, additional, form, of, coelomocyte, not, found, in, other, echinoderms, has, a, flattened, discoid, shape, and, contains, hemoglobin, as, a, result, in, many, though, not, all, species, both, the, blood, and, the, coelomic, fluid, are, red, in, colour, vanadium, has, been, reported, in, high, concentrations, in, holothurian, blood, however, researchers, have, been, unable, to, reproduce, these, results, like, all, echinoderms, sea, cucumbers, possess, pentaradial, symmetry, with, their, bodies, divided, into, five, nearly, identical, parts, around, a, central, axis, however, because, of, their, posture, they, have, secondarily, evolved, a, degree, of, bilateral, symmetry, for, example, because, one, side, of, the, body, is, typically, pressed, against, the, substratum, and, the, other, is, not, there, is, usually, some, difference, between, the, two, surfaces, except, for, apodida, like, sea, urchins, most, sea, cucumbers, have, five, strip, like, ambulacral, areas, running, along, the, length, of, the, body, from, the, mouth, to, the, anus, the, three, on, the, lower, surface, have, numerous, tube, feet, often, with, suckers, that, allow, the, animal, to, crawl, along, they, are, called, trivium, the, two, on, the, upper, surface, have, under, developed, or, vestigial, tube, feet, and, some, species, lack, tube, feet, altogether, this, face, is, called, bivium, in, some, species, the, ambulacral, areas, can, no, longer, be, distinguished, with, tube, feet, spread, over, a, much, wider, area, of, the, body, those, of, the, order, apodida, have, no, tube, feet, or, ambulacral, areas, at, all, and, burrow, through, sediment, with, muscular, contractions, of, their, body, similar, to, that, of, worms, however, five, radial, lines, are, generally, still, obvious, along, their, body, even, in, those, sea, cucumbers, that, lack, regular, tube, feet, those, that, are, immediately, around, the, mouth, are, always, present, these, are, highly, modified, into, retractile, tentacles, much, larger, than, the, locomotive, tube, feet, depending, on, the, species, sea, cucumbers, have, between, ten, and, thirty, such, tentacles, and, these, can, have, a, wide, variety, of, shapes, depending, on, the, diet, of, the, animal, and, other, conditions, many, sea, cucumbers, have, papillae, conical, fleshy, projections, of, the, body, wall, with, sensory, tube, feet, at, their, apices, these, can, even, evolve, into, long, antennae, like, structures, especially, on, the, abyssal, genus, scotoplanes, echinoderms, typically, possess, an, internal, skeleton, composed, of, plates, of, calcium, carbonate, in, most, sea, cucumbers, however, these, have, become, reduced, to, microscopic, ossicles, embedded, beneath, the, skin, a, few, genera, such, as, sphaerothuria, retain, relatively, large, plates, giving, them, a, scaly, armour, sea, cucumbers, can, be, found, in, great, numbers, on, the, deep, seafloor, where, they, often, make, up, the, majority, of, the, animal, biomass, at, depths, deeper, than, 8, 900, m, 5, 5, mi, sea, cucumbers, comprise, 90, of, the, total, mass, of, the, macrofauna, sea, cucumbers, form, large, herds, that, move, across, the, bathygraphic, features, of, the, ocean, hunting, food, the, body, of, some, deep, water, holothurians, such, as, enypniastes, eximia, peniagone, leander, and, paelopatides, confundens, is, made, of, a, tough, gelatinous, tissue, with, unique, properties, that, makes, the, animals, able, to, control, their, own, buoyancy, making, it, possible, for, them, to, either, live, on, the, ocean, floor, or, to, actively, swim, or, float, over, it, in, order, to, move, to, new, locations, in, a, manner, similar, to, how, the, group, torquaratoridae, floats, through, water, holothurians, appear, to, be, the, echinoderms, best, adapted, to, extreme, depths, and, are, still, very, diversified, beyond, 5, 000, metres, 16, 000, ft, deep, several, species, from, the, family, elpidiidae, sea, pigs, can, be, found, deeper, than, 9, 500, metres, 31, 200, ft, and, the, record, seems, to, be, some, species, of, the, genus, myriotrochus, in, particular, myriotrochus, bruuni, identified, down, to, 10, 687, metres, 35, 062, ft, deep, in, more, shallow, waters, sea, cucumbers, can, form, dense, populations, the, strawberry, sea, cucumber, squamocnus, brevidentis, of, new, zealand, lives, on, rocky, walls, around, the, southern, coast, of, the, south, island, where, populations, sometimes, reach, densities, of, 1, 000, animals, m, 2, 93, animals, sq, ft, for, this, reason, one, such, area, in, fiordland, is, called, the, strawberry, fields, some, abyssal, species, in, the, abyssal, order, elasipodida, have, evolved, to, a, benthopelagic, behaviour, their, body, is, nearly, the, same, density, as, the, water, around, them, so, they, can, make, long, jumps, up, to, 1, 000, metres, or, 3, 300, feet, high, before, falling, slowly, back, to, the, ocean, floor, most, of, them, have, specific, swimming, appendages, such, as, some, kind, of, umbrella, like, enypniastes, or, a, long, lobe, on, top, of, the, body, psychropotes, only, one, species, is, known, as, a, true, completely, pelagic, species, that, never, comes, close, to, the, bottom, pelagothuria, natatrix, holothuroidea, are, generally, scavengers, feeding, on, debris, in, the, benthic, zone, of, the, ocean, exceptions, include, some, pelagic, cucumbers, and, the, species, rynkatorpa, pawsoni, which, has, a, commensal, relationship, with, deep, sea, anglerfish, the, diet, of, most, cucumbers, consists, of, plankton, and, decaying, organic, matter, found, in, the, sea, some, sea, cucumbers, position, themselves, in, currents, and, catch, food, that, flows, by, with, their, open, tentacles, they, also, sift, through, the, bottom, sediments, using, their, tentacles, other, species, can, dig, into, bottom, silt, or, sand, until, they, are, completely, buried, they, then, extrude, their, feeding, tentacles, ready, to, withdraw, at, any, hint, of, danger, in, the, south, pacific, sea, cucumbers, may, be, found, in, densities, of, 40, individuals, m, 2, 3, 7, individuals, sq, ft, these, populations, can, process, 19, kilograms, per, square, metre, 3, 9, lb, sq, ft, of, sediment, per, year, the, shape, of, the, tentacles, is, generally, adapted, to, the, diet, and, to, the, size, of, the, particles, to, be, ingested, the, filter, feeding, species, mostly, have, complex, arborescent, tentacles, intended, to, maximize, the, surface, area, available, for, filtering, while, the, species, feeding, on, the, substratum, will, more, often, need, digitate, tentacles, to, sort, out, the, nutritional, material, the, detritivore, species, living, on, fine, sand, or, mud, more, often, need, shorter, peltate, tentacles, shaped, like, shovels, a, single, specimen, can, swallow, more, than, 45, kilograms, 99, lb, of, sediment, a, year, and, their, excellent, digestive, capacities, allow, them, to, reject, a, finer, purer, and, homogeneous, sediment, therefore, sea, cucumbers, play, a, major, role, in, the, biological, processing, of, the, sea, bed, bioturbation, purge, homogenization, of, the, substratum, etc, most, sea, cucumbers, reproduce, by, releasing, sperm, and, ova, into, the, ocean, water, depending, on, conditions, one, organism, can, produce, thousands, of, gametes, sea, cucumbers, are, typically, dioecious, with, separate, male, and, female, individuals, but, some, species, are, protandric, the, reproductive, system, consists, of, a, single, gonad, consisting, of, a, cluster, of, tubules, emptying, into, a, single, duct, that, opens, on, the, upper, surface, of, the, animal, close, to, the, tentacles, at, least, 30, species, including, the, red, chested, sea, cucumber, pseudocnella, insolens, fertilize, their, eggs, internally, and, then, pick, up, the, fertilized, zygote, with, one, of, their, feeding, tentacles, the, egg, is, then, inserted, into, a, pouch, on, the, adult, s, body, where, it, develops, and, eventually, hatches, from, the, pouch, as, a, juvenile, sea, cucumber, a, few, species, are, known, to, brood, their, young, inside, the, body, cavity, giving, birth, through, a, small, rupture, in, the, body, wall, close, to, the, anus, in, all, other, species, the, egg, develops, into, a, free, swimming, larva, typically, after, around, three, days, of, development, the, first, stage, of, larval, development, is, known, as, an, auricularia, and, is, only, around, 1, mm, 39, mils, in, length, this, larva, swims, by, means, of, a, long, band, of, cilia, wrapped, around, its, body, and, somewhat, resembles, the, bipinnaria, larva, of, starfish, as, the, larva, grows, it, transforms, into, the, doliolaria, with, a, barrel, shaped, body, and, three, to, five, separate, rings, of, cilia, the, pentacularia, is, the, third, larval, stage, of, sea, cucumber, where, the, tentacles, appear, the, tentacles, are, usually, the, first, adult, features, to, appear, before, the, regular, tube, feet, numerous, small, animals, can, live, in, symbiosis, or, commensalism, with, sea, cucumbers, as, well, as, some, parasites, some, cleaner, shrimps, can, live, on, the, tegument, of, holothurians, in, particular, several, species, of, the, genus, periclimenes, genus, which, is, specialized, in, echinoderms, in, particular, periclimenes, imperator, a, variety, of, fish, most, commonly, pearl, fish, have, evolved, a, commensalistic, symbiotic, relationship, with, sea, cucumbers, in, which, the, pearl, fish, will, live, in, sea, cucumber, s, cloaca, using, it, for, protection, from, predation, a, source, of, food, the, nutrients, passing, in, and, out, of, the, anus, from, the, water, and, to, develop, into, their, adult, stage, of, life, many, polychaete, worms, family, polynoidae, and, crabs, like, lissocarcinus, orbicularis, have, also, specialized, to, use, the, mouth, or, the, cloacal, respiratory, trees, for, protection, by, living, inside, the, sea, cucumber, nevertheless, holothurians, species, of, the, genus, actinopyga, have, anal, teeth, that, prevent, visitors, from, penetrating, their, anus, sea, cucumbers, can, also, shelter, bivalvia, as, endocommensals, such, as, entovalva, sp, sea, cucumbers, are, often, ignored, by, most, of, the, marine, predators, because, of, the, toxins, they, contain, in, particular, holothurin, and, because, of, their, often, spectacular, defensive, systems, however, they, remain, a, prey, for, some, highly, specialized, predators, which, are, not, affected, by, their, toxins, such, as, the, big, mollusks, tonna, galea, and, tonna, perdix, which, paralyzes, them, using, powerful, poison, before, swallowing, them, completely, some, other, less, specialized, and, opportunist, predators, can, also, prey, on, sea, cucumbers, sometimes, when, they, cannot, find, any, better, food, such, as, certain, species, of, fish, triggerfish, pufferfish, and, crustaceans, crabs, lobsters, hermit, crabs, some, species, of, coral, reef, sea, cucumbers, within, the, order, aspidochirotida, can, defend, themselves, by, expelling, their, sticky, cuvierian, tubules, enlargements, of, the, respiratory, tree, that, float, freely, in, the, coelom, to, entangle, potential, predators, when, startled, these, cucumbers, may, expel, some, of, them, through, a, tear, in, the, wall, of, the, cloaca, in, an, autotomic, process, known, as, evisceration, replacement, tubules, grow, back, in, one, and, a, half, to, five, weeks, depending, on, the, species, the, release, of, these, tubules, can, also, be, accompanied, by, the, discharge, of, a, toxic, chemical, known, as, holothurin, which, has, similar, properties, to, soap, this, chemical, can, kill, animals, in, the, vicinity, and, is, one, more, method, by, which, these, sedentary, animals, can, defend, themselves, if, the, water, temperature, becomes, too, high, some, species, of, sea, cucumber, from, temperate, seas, can, aestivate, while, they, are, in, this, state, of, dormancy, they, stop, feeding, their, gut, atrophies, their, metabolism, slows, down, and, they, lose, weight, the, body, returns, to, its, normal, state, when, conditions, improve, holothuroidea, sea, cucumbers, are, one, of, five, extant, classes, that, make, up, the, phylum, echinodermata, this, is, one, of, the, most, distinctive, and, diverse, phyla, ranging, from, starfish, to, urchins, to, sea, cucumbers, and, many, other, organisms, the, echinoderms, are, mainly, distinguished, from, other, phyla, by, their, body, plan, and, organization, the, earliest, sea, cucumbers, are, known, from, the, middle, ordovician, over, 450, million, years, ago, the, apodida, is, the, sister, group, to, the, other, orders, of, sea, cucumbers, all, echinoderms, share, three, main, characteristics, when, mature, echinoderms, have, a, pentamerous, radial, symmetry, while, this, can, easily, be, seen, in, a, sea, star, or, brittle, star, in, the, sea, cucumber, it, is, less, distinct, and, seen, in, their, five, primary, tentacles, the, pentamerous, radial, symmetry, can, also, be, seen, in, their, five, ambulacral, canals, the, ambulacral, canals, are, used, in, their, water, vascular, system, which, is, another, characteristic, that, binds, this, phylum, together, the, water, vascular, system, develops, from, their, middle, coelom, or, hydrocoel, echinoderms, use, this, system, for, many, things, including, movement, by, pushing, water, in, and, out, of, their, podia, or, tube, feet, echinoderms, tube, feet, including, sea, cucumbers, can, be, seen, aligned, along, the, side, of, their, axes, while, echinoderms, are, invertebrates, meaning, they, do, not, have, a, spine, they, do, all, have, an, endoskeleton, that, is, secreted, by, the, mesenchyme, this, endoskeleton, is, composed, of, plates, called, ossicles, they, are, always, internal, but, may, only, be, covered, by, a, thin, epidermal, layer, like, in, sea, urchin, s, spines, in, the, sea, cucumber, the, ossicles, are, only, found, in, the, dermis, making, them, a, very, supple, organism, for, most, echinoderms, their, ossicles, are, found, in, units, making, up, a, three, dimensional, structure, however, in, sea, cucumbers, the, ossicles, are, found, in, a, two, dimensional, network, all, echinoderms, also, possess, anatomical, feature, s, called, mutable, collagenous, tissues, or, mcts, such, tissues, can, rapidly, change, their, passive, mechanical, properties, from, soft, to, stiff, under, the, control, of, the, nervous, system, and, coordinated, with, muscle, activity, different, echinoderm, classes, use, mcts, in, different, ways, the, asteroids, sea, stars, can, detach, limbs, for, self, defense, and, then, regenerate, them, the, crinoidea, sea, fans, can, go, from, stiff, to, limp, depending, on, the, current, for, optimal, filter, feeding, the, echinoidea, sand, dollars, use, mcts, to, grow, and, replace, their, rows, of, teeth, when, they, need, new, ones, the, holothuroidea, sea, cucumbers, use, mcts, to, eviscerate, their, gut, as, a, self, defense, response, mcts, can, be, used, in, many, ways, but, are, all, similar, at, the, cellular, level, and, in, mechanics, of, function, a, common, trend, in, the, uses, of, mcts, is, that, they, are, generally, used, for, self, defense, mechanisms, and, in, regeneration, holothurian, classification, is, complex, and, their, paleontological, phylogeny, relies, on, a, limited, number, of, well, preserved, specimens, the, modern, taxonomy, is, based, first, of, all, on, the, presence, or, the, shape, of, certain, soft, parts, podia, lungs, tentacles, peripharingal, crown, to, determine, the, main, orders, and, secondarily, on, the, microscopic, examination, of, ossicles, to, determine, the, genus, and, the, species, contemporary, genetic, methods, have, been, helpful, in, clarifying, their, classification, taxonomic, classification, according, to, world, register, of, marine, species, to, supply, the, markets, of, southern, china, makassar, trepangers, traded, with, the, indigenous, australians, of, arnhem, land, from, at, least, the, 18th, century, and, probably, earlier, this, is, the, first, recorded, example, of, trade, between, the, inhabitants, of, the, australian, continent, and, their, asian, neighbours, there, are, many, commercially, important, species, of, sea, cucumber, that, are, harvested, and, dried, for, export, for, use, in, chinese, cuisine, as, hoisam, some, of, the, more, commonly, found, species, in, markets, include, according, to, the, american, cancer, society, although, it, has, been, used, in, traditional, asian, folk, medicine, for, a, variety, of, ailments, there, is, little, reliable, scientific, evidence, to, support, claims, that, sea, cucumber, is, effective, in, treating, cancer, arthritis, and, other, diseases, but, research, is, examining, whether, some, compounds, made, by, sea, cucumbers, may, be, helpful, against, cancer, various, pharmaceutical, companies, emphasize, gamat, the, malay, traditional, medicinal, usage, of, this, animal, extracts, are, prepared, and, made, into, oil, cream, or, cosmetics, some, products, are, intended, to, be, taken, internally, a, review, article, found, that, chondroitin, sulfate, and, related, compounds, found, in, sea, cucumbers, can, help, in, treating, joint, pain, and, that, dried, sea, cucumber, is, medicinally, effective, in, suppressing, arthralgia, another, study, suggested, that, sea, cucumbers, contain, all, the, fatty, acids, necessary, to, play, a, potentially, active, role, in, tissue, repair, sea, cucumbers, are, under, investigation, for, use, in, treating, ailments, including, colorectal, cancer, surgical, probes, made, of, nanocomposite, material, based, on, the, sea, cucumber, have, been, shown, to, reduce, brain, scarring, one, study, found, that, a, lectin, from, cucumaria, echinata, impaired, the, development, of, the, malaria, parasite, when, produced, by, transgenic, mosquitoes, sea, cucumbers, are, harvested, from, the, environment, both, legally, and, illegally, and, are, increasingly, farmed, via, aquaculture, the, harvested, animals, are, normally, dried, for, resale, in, 2016, prices, on, alibaba, ranged, up, to, 1, 000, per, kilogram, 450, lb, in, recent, years, the, sea, cucumber, industry, in, alaska, has, increased, due, to, increased, demand, for, the, skins, and, muscles, to, china, wild, sea, cucumbers, are, caught, by, divers, wild, alaskan, sea, cucumbers, have, higher, nutritional, value, and, are, larger, than, farmed, chinese, sea, cucumbers, larger, size, and, higher, nutritional, value, has, allowed, the, alaskan, fisheries, to, continue, to, compete, for, market, share, one, of, australia, s, oldest, fisheries, is, the, collection, of, sea, cucumber, harvested, by, divers, from, throughout, the, coral, sea, in, far, north, queensland, torres, straits, and, western, australia, in, the, late, 1800s, as, many, as, 400, divers, operated, from, cook, town, queensland, overfishing, of, sea, cucumbers, in, the, great, barrier, reef, is, threatening, their, population, their, popularity, as, luxury, seafood, in, east, asian, countries, poses, a, serious, threat, as, of, 2013, a, thriving, black, market, was, driven, by, demand, in, china, where, 450, grams, 1, lb, at, its, peak, might, have, sold, for, the, equivalent, of, us, 300, and, a, single, sea, cucumber, for, about, us, 160, a, crackdown, by, governments, both, in, and, out, of, china, reduced, both, prices, and, consumption, particularly, among, government, officials, who, had, been, known, to, eat, and, were, able, to, afford, purchasing, the, most, expensive, and, rare, species, in, the, caribbean, sea, off, the, shores, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, near, fishing, ports, such, as, dzilam, de, bravo, illegal, harvesting, had, devastated, the, population, and, resulted, in, conflict, as, rival, gangs, struggled, to, control, the, harvest, overexploitation, of, sea, cucumber, stocks, in, many, parts, of, the, world, provided, motivation, for, the, development, of, sea, cucumber, aquaculture, in, the, early, 1980s, the, chinese, and, japanese, were, the, first, to, develop, successful, hatchery, technology, on, apostichopus, japonicus, prized, for, its, high, meat, content, and, success, in, commercial, hatcheries, using, techniques, pioneered, by, the, chinese, and, japanese, a, second, species, holothuria, scabra, was, cultured, for, the, first, time, in, india, in, 1988, in, recent, years, australia, indonesia, new, caledonia, maldives, solomon, islands, and, vietnam, have, successfully, cultured, h, scabra, using, the, same, technology, and, now, culture, other, species, in, india, the, commercial, harvest, and, transportation, of, sea, cucumbers, has, been, strictly, banned, under, schedule, i, of, the, wild, life, protection, act, 1972, wlpa, since, 2001, in, 2020, the, indian, government, created, the, world, s, first, sea, cucumber, conservation, area, the, dr,
