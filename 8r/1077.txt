the, oat, avena, sativa, sometimes, called, the, common, oat, is, a, species, of, cereal, grain, grown, for, its, seed, which, is, known, by, the, same, name, usually, in, the, plural, oats, appear, to, have, been, domesticated, as, a, secondary, crop, as, their, seeds, resembled, those, of, other, cereals, closely, enough, for, them, to, be, included, by, early, cultivators, oats, tolerate, cold, winters, less, well, than, cereals, such, as, wheat, barley, and, rye, but, need, less, summer, heat, and, more, rain, making, them, important, in, areas, such, as, northwest, europe, that, have, cool, wet, summers, they, can, tolerate, low, nutrient, and, acid, soils, oats, grow, thickly, and, vigorously, allowing, them, to, outcompete, many, weeds, and, compared, to, other, cereals, are, relatively, free, from, diseases, oats, are, used, for, human, consumption, as, oatmeal, including, as, steel, cut, oats, or, rolled, oats, global, production, is, dominated, by, canada, and, russia, global, trade, is, a, small, part, of, production, most, of, the, grain, being, consumed, within, the, producing, countries, oats, are, a, nutrient, rich, food, associated, with, lower, blood, cholesterol, and, reduced, risk, of, human, heart, disease, when, consumed, regularly, one, of, the, most, common, uses, of, oats, is, as, livestock, feed, the, crop, can, also, be, grown, as, groundcover, and, ploughed, in, as, a, green, manure, phylogenetic, analysis, using, molecular, dna, and, morphological, evidence, places, the, oat, genus, avena, in, the, pooideae, subfamily, that, subfamily, includes, the, cereals, wheat, barley, and, rye, they, are, in, the, triticeae, tribe, while, avena, is, in, the, poeae, along, with, grasses, such, as, briza, and, agrostis, the, wild, ancestor, of, avena, sativa, and, the, closely, related, minor, crop, a, byzantina, is, a, sterilis, a, naturally, hexaploid, wild, oat, one, that, has, its, dna, in, six, sets, of, chromosomes, genetic, evidence, shows, that, the, ancestral, forms, of, a, sterilis, grew, in, the, fertile, crescent, of, the, near, east, analysis, of, maternal, lineages, of, 25, avena, species, using, chloroplast, and, mitochondrial, dna, showed, that, a, sativa, s, hexaploid, genome, derives, from, three, diploid, oat, species, each, with, two, sets, of, chromosomes, the, sets, are, dubbed, a, b, c, and, d, the, diploid, species, are, the, cc, a, ventricosa, the, aa, a, canariensis, and, the, aa, a, longiglumis, along, with, two, tetraploid, oats, each, with, four, sets, namely, the, aacc, a, insularis, and, the, aabb, a, agadiriana, tetraploids, were, formed, as, much, as, 10, 6, mya, and, hexaploids, as, much, as, 7, 4, mya, genomic, study, suggests, that, the, hulled, variety, and, the, naked, variety, a, sativa, var, nuda, diverged, around, 51, 200, years, ago, long, before, domestication, this, implies, that, the, two, varieties, were, domesticated, independently, oats, are, thought, to, have, emerged, as, a, secondary, crop, this, means, that, they, are, derived, from, what, was, considered, a, weed, of, the, primary, cereal, domesticates, such, as, wheat, they, survived, as, a, vavilovian, mimic, by, having, grains, that, neolithic, people, found, hard, to, distinguish, from, the, primary, crop, oats, were, cultivated, for, some, thousands, of, years, before, they, were, domesticated, a, granary, from, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, about, 11, 400, to, 11, 200, years, ago, in, the, jordan, valley, in, the, middle, east, contained, a, large, number, of, wild, oat, grains, 120, 000, seeds, of, a, sterilis, the, find, implies, intentional, cultivation, domesticated, oat, grains, first, appear, in, the, archaeological, record, in, europe, around, 3000, years, ago, the, oat, is, a, tall, stout, grass, a, member, of, the, family, poaceae, it, can, grow, to, a, height, of, 1, 8, metres, 5, 9, ft, the, leaves, are, long, narrow, and, pointed, and, grow, upwards, they, can, be, some, 15, to, 40, centimetres, 5, 9, to, 15, 7, in, in, length, and, around, 5, to, 15, millimetres, 0, 20, to, 0, 59, in, in, width, at, the, top, of, the, stem, the, plant, branches, into, a, loose, cluster, or, panicle, of, spikelets, these, contain, the, wind, pollinated, flowers, which, mature, into, the, oat, seeds, or, grains, botanically, the, grain, is, a, caryopsis, as, the, wall, of, the, fruit, is, fused, on, to, the, actual, seed, like, other, cereal, grains, the, caryopsis, contains, the, outer, husk, or, bran, the, starchy, food, store, or, endosperm, which, occupies, most, of, the, seed, and, the, protein, rich, germ, which, if, planted, in, soil, can, grow, into, a, new, plant, oats, are, annual, plants, best, grown, in, temperate, regions, they, tolerate, cold, winters, less, well, than, wheat, rye, or, barley, they, are, harmed, by, sustained, cold, below, 7, c, 20, f, they, have, a, lower, summer, heat, requirement, and, greater, tolerance, of, and, need, for, rain, than, the, other, cereals, mentioned, so, they, are, particularly, important, in, areas, with, cool, wet, summers, such, as, northwest, europe, oats, can, grow, in, most, fertile, drained, soils, being, tolerant, of, a, wide, variety, of, soil, types, although, better, yields, are, achieved, at, a, soil, ph, of, 5, 3, to, 5, 7, oats, can, tolerate, soils, with, a, ph, as, low, as, 4, 5, they, are, better, able, to, grow, in, low, nutrient, soils, than, wheat, or, maize, but, generally, are, less, tolerant, of, high, soil, salinity, than, other, cereals, oats, can, outcompete, many, weeds, as, they, grow, thickly, with, many, leafy, shoots, and, vigorously, but, are, still, subject, to, some, broadleaf, weeds, control, can, be, by, herbicides, or, by, integrated, pest, management, with, measures, such, as, sowing, seed, that, is, free, of, weeds, oats, are, relatively, free, from, diseases, nonetheless, they, suffer, from, some, leaf, diseases, such, as, stem, rust, puccinia, graminis, f, sp, avenae, and, crown, rust, p, coronata, var, avenae, crown, rust, infection, can, greatly, reduce, photosynthesis, and, overall, physiological, activities, of, oat, leaves, thereby, reducing, growth, and, crop, yield, oats, are, attacked, by, nematodes, and, by, insects, including, aphids, armyworms, cockchafers, grasshoppers, thrips, and, wireworms, most, of, these, pests, are, not, specific, to, oats, and, only, occasionally, cause, significant, damage, to, oat, crops, harvested, oats, go, through, multiple, stages, of, milling, the, first, stage, is, cleaning, to, remove, seeds, of, other, plants, stones, and, any, other, extraneous, materials, next, is, dehulling, to, remove, the, indigestible, bran, leaving, the, seed, or, groat, heating, denatures, enzymes, in, the, seed, that, would, make, it, go, sour, or, rancid, the, grain, is, then, dried, to, minimise, the, risk, of, spoilage, by, bacteria, and, fungi, there, may, follow, numerous, stages, of, cutting, or, grinding, the, grain, depending, on, which, sort, of, product, is, required, for, oatmeal, oat, flour, the, grain, is, ground, to, a, specified, fineness, for, home, use, such, as, making, porridge, oats, are, often, rolled, flat, to, make, them, quicker, to, cook, oat, flour, can, be, ground, for, small, scale, use, by, pulsing, rolled, oats, or, old, fashioned, not, quick, oats, in, a, food, processor, or, spice, mill, in, 2022, global, production, of, oats, was, 26, million, tonnes, led, by, canada, with, 20, of, the, total, and, russia, with, 17, table, this, compares, to, over, 100, million, tonnes, for, wheat, for, example, global, trade, represents, a, modest, percentage, of, production, less, than, 10, most, of, the, grain, being, consumed, within, producing, countries, the, main, exporter, is, canada, followed, by, sweden, and, finland, the, us, is, the, main, importer, oats, futures, are, traded, in, us, dollars, in, quantities, of, 5000, bushels, on, the, chicago, board, of, trade, and, have, delivery, dates, in, march, may, july, september, and, december, avena, sativa, is, an, allohexaploid, species, with, three, ancestral, genomes, 2, n, 6, x, 42, aaccdd, as, a, result, the, genome, is, large, 12, 6, gb, 1c, value, 12, 85, and, complex, cultivated, hexaploid, oat, has, a, unique, mosaic, chromosome, architecture, that, is, the, result, of, numerous, translocations, between, the, three, subgenomes, these, translocations, may, cause, breeding, barriers, and, incompatibilities, when, crossing, varieties, with, different, chromosomal, architecture, hence, oat, breeding, and, the, crossing, of, desired, traits, has, been, hampered, by, the, lack, of, a, reference, genome, assembly, in, may, 2022, a, fully, annotated, reference, genome, sequence, of, avena, sativa, was, reported, the, aa, subgenome, is, presumed, to, be, derived, from, avena, longiglumis, and, the, ccdd, from, the, tetraploid, avena, insularis, species, of, avena, can, hybridize, and, genes, introgressed, brought, in, from, other, a, genome, species, have, contributed, many, valuable, traits, like, resistance, to, oat, crown, rust, pc98, is, one, such, trait, introgressed, from, a, sterilis, cav, 1979, conferring, all, stage, resistance, asr, against, pca, it, is, possible, to, hybridize, oats, with, grasses, in, other, genera, allowing, plant, breeders, the, ready, introgression, of, traits, in, contrast, to, wheat, oats, sometimes, retain, chromosomes, from, maize, or, pearl, millet, after, such, crosses, these, wide, crosses, are, typically, made, to, generate, doubled, haploid, breeding, material, the, rapid, loss, of, the, alien, chromosomes, from, the, unrelated, pollen, donor, results, in, a, plant, with, only, a, single, set, of, chromosomes, a, haploid, the, addition, lines, with, alien, chromosomes, can, be, used, as, a, source, for, novel, traits, in, oats, for, example, research, on, oat, maize, addition, lines, has, been, used, to, map, genes, involved, in, c4, photosynthesis, to, obtain, mendelian, inheritance, of, these, novel, traits, radiation, hybrid, lines, have, been, established, where, maize, chromosome, segments, have, been, introgressed, into, the, oat, genome, this, potentially, transfers, thousands, of, genes, from, a, species, that, is, distantly, related, but, is, not, considered, a, gmo, technique, a, 2013, study, applied, simple, sequence, repeat, and, found, five, major, groupings, namely, commercial, cultivars, and, four, landrace, groups, uncooked, oats, are, 66, carbohydrates, including, 11, dietary, fiber, and, 4, beta, glucans, 7, fat, 17, protein, and, 8, water, table, in, a, reference, serving, of, 100, g, 3, 5, oz, oats, provide, 389, kilocalories, 1, 630, kj, and, are, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, protein, 34, dv, dietary, fiber, 44, dv, several, b, vitamins, and, numerous, dietary, minerals, especially, manganese, 213, dv, table, chronic, consumption, of, oat, products, lowers, blood, levels, of, low, density, lipoprotein, and, total, cholesterol, reducing, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, the, benefical, effect, of, oat, consumption, on, lowering, blood, lipids, is, attributed, to, oat, beta, glucan, oat, consumption, can, help, to, reduce, body, mass, index, in, obese, people, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, allows, companies, to, make, health, claims, on, labels, of, food, products, that, contain, soluble, fiber, from, whole, oats, as, long, as, the, food, provides, 0, 75, grams, of, soluble, fiber, per, serving, when, used, in, foods, oats, are, most, commonly, rolled, or, crushed, into, oatmeal, or, ground, into, fine, oat, flour, oatmeal, is, chiefly, eaten, as, porridge, but, may, also, be, used, in, a, variety, of, baked, goods, such, as, oatcakes, which, may, be, made, with, coarse, steel, cut, oats, for, a, rougher, texture, oatmeal, cookies, and, oat, bread, oats, are, an, ingredient, in, many, cold, cereals, in, particular, muesli, and, granola, the, quaker, oats, company, introduced, instant, oatmeal, in, 1966, oats, are, also, used, to, produce, milk, substitutes, oat, milk, as, of, late, 2020, the, oat, milk, market, became, the, second, largest, among, plant, milks, in, the, united, states, following, almond, milk, but, exceeding, the, sales, of, soy, milk, as, a, mainstay, of, west, wales, for, centuries, until, changes, in, farming, practices, in, the, 1960s, oats, were, used, in, many, traditional, welsh, dishes, including, laverbread, a, welsh, breakfast, and, cockles, and, eggs, served, with, oatbread, in, britain, oats, are, sometimes, used, for, brewing, beer, such, as, oatmeal, stout, where, a, percentage, of, oats, often, 30, is, added, to, the, barley, for, the, wort, oatmeal, caudle, made, of, ale, and, oatmeal, with, spices, was, a, traditional, british, drink, and, a, favourite, of, oliver, cromwell, oats, are, commonly, used, as, feed, for, horses, when, extra, carbohydrates, and, the, subsequent, boost, in, energy, are, required, the, oat, hull, may, be, crushed, rolled, or, crimped, to, make, them, easier, to, digest, or, may, be, fed, whole, they, may, be, given, alone, or, as, part, of, a, blended, food, pellet, cattle, are, also, fed, oats, either, whole, or, ground, into, a, coarse, flour, using, a, roller, mill, burr, mill, or, hammermill, oat, forage, is, commonly, used, to, feed, all, kinds, of, ruminants, as, pasture, straw, hay, or, silage, winter, oats, may, be, grown, as, an, off, season, groundcover, and, ploughed, under, in, the, spring, as, a, green, fertilizer, or, harvested, in, early, summer, they, also, can, be, used, for, pasture, they, can, be, grazed, a, while, then, allowed, to, head, out, for, grain, production, or, grazed, continuously, until, other, pastures, are, ready, oat, straw, is, used, as, animal, bedding, it, absorbs, liquids, better, than, wheat, straw, the, straw, can, be, used, for, making, corn, dollies, small, decorative, woven, figures, tied, in, a, muslin, bag, oat, straw, has, been, used, to, soften, bath, water, celiac, or, coeliac, disease, is, a, permanent, autoimmune, disease, triggered, by, gluten, proteins, it, almost, always, occurs, in, genetically, predisposed, people, having, a, prevalence, of, about, 1, in, the, developed, world, oat, products, are, frequently, contaminated, by, other, gluten, containing, grains, mainly, wheat, and, barley, requiring, caution, in, the, use, of, oats, if, people, are, sensitive, to, the, gluten, in, those, grains, for, example, oat, bread, often, contains, only, a, small, proportion, of, oats, alongside, wheat, or, other, cereals, use, of, pure, oats, in, a, gluten, free, diet, offers, improved, nutritional, value, but, remains, controversial, because, a, small, proportion, of, people, with, celiac, disease, react, to, pure, oats, in, his, 1755, dictionary, of, the, english, language, samuel, johnson, defined, oats, as, a, grain, which, in, england, is, generally, given, to, horses, but, in, scotland,
