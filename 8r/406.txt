ants, are, eusocial, insects, of, the, family, formicidae, and, along, with, the, related, wasps, and, bees, belong, to, the, order, hymenoptera, ants, evolved, from, vespoid, wasp, ancestors, in, the, cretaceous, period, more, than, 13, 800, of, an, estimated, total, of, 22, 000, species, have, been, classified, they, are, easily, identified, by, their, geniculate, elbowed, antennae, and, the, distinctive, node, like, structure, that, forms, their, slender, waists, ants, form, colonies, that, range, in, size, from, a, few, dozen, individuals, often, living, in, small, natural, cavities, to, highly, organised, colonies, that, may, occupy, large, territories, with, sizeable, nest, that, consist, of, millions, of, individuals, or, into, the, hundreds, of, millions, in, super, colonies, typical, colonies, consist, of, various, castes, of, sterile, wingless, females, most, of, which, are, workers, ergates, as, well, as, soldiers, dinergates, and, other, specialised, groups, nearly, all, ant, colonies, also, have, some, fertile, males, called, drones, and, one, or, more, fertile, females, called, queens, gynes, the, colonies, are, described, as, superorganisms, because, the, ants, appear, to, operate, as, a, unified, entity, collectively, working, together, to, support, the, colony, ants, have, colonised, almost, every, landmass, on, earth, the, only, places, lacking, indigenous, ants, are, antarctica, and, a, few, remote, or, inhospitable, islands, ants, thrive, in, moist, tropical, ecosystems, and, may, exceed, the, combined, biomass, of, wild, birds, and, mammals, their, success, in, so, many, environments, has, been, attributed, to, their, social, organisation, and, their, ability, to, modify, habitats, tap, resources, and, defend, themselves, their, long, co, evolution, with, other, species, has, led, to, mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and, mutualistic, relationships, ant, societies, have, division, of, labour, communication, between, individuals, and, an, ability, to, solve, complex, problems, these, parallels, with, human, societies, have, long, been, an, inspiration, and, subject, of, study, many, human, cultures, make, use, of, ants, in, cuisine, medication, and, rites, some, species, are, valued, in, their, role, as, biological, pest, control, agents, their, ability, to, exploit, resources, may, bring, ants, into, conflict, with, humans, however, as, they, can, damage, crops, and, invade, buildings, some, species, such, as, the, red, imported, fire, ant, solenopsis, invicta, of, south, america, are, regarded, as, invasive, species, in, other, parts, of, the, world, establishing, themselves, in, areas, where, they, have, been, introduced, accidentally, the, word, ant, and, the, archaic, word, emmet, are, derived, from, ante, emete, of, middle, english, which, come, from, mette, of, old, english, these, are, all, related, to, low, saxon, e, e, mt, empe, and, varieties, old, saxon, emeta, and, to, german, ameise, old, high, german, meiza, all, of, these, words, come, from, west, germanic, maitj, n, and, the, original, meaning, of, the, word, was, the, biter, from, proto, germanic, ai, off, away, mait, cut, the, family, name, formicidae, is, derived, from, the, latin, form, ca, ant, from, which, the, words, in, other, romance, languages, such, as, the, portuguese, formiga, italian, formica, spanish, hormiga, romanian, furnic, and, french, fourmi, are, derived, it, has, been, hypothesised, that, a, proto, indo, european, word, morwi, was, the, root, for, sanskrit, vamrah, greek, m, rm, x, old, church, slavonic, mraviji, old, irish, moirb, old, norse, maurr, dutch, mier, swedish, myra, danish, myre, middle, dutch, miere, and, crimean, gothic, miera, the, family, formicidae, belongs, to, the, order, hymenoptera, which, also, includes, sawflies, bees, and, wasps, ants, evolved, from, a, lineage, within, the, stinging, wasps, and, a, 2013, study, suggests, that, they, are, a, sister, group, of, the, apoidea, however, since, apoidea, is, a, superfamily, ants, must, be, upgraded, to, the, same, rank, a, more, detailed, basic, taxonomy, was, proposed, in, 2020, three, species, of, the, extinct, mid, cretaceous, genera, camelomecia, and, camelosphecia, were, placed, outside, of, the, formicidae, in, a, separate, clade, within, the, general, superfamily, formicoidea, which, together, with, apoidea, forms, the, higher, ranking, group, formicapoidina, fern, ndez, et, al, 2021, suggest, that, the, common, ancestors, of, ants, and, apoids, within, the, formicapoidina, probably, existed, as, early, as, in, the, end, of, the, jurassic, period, before, divergence, in, the, cretaceous, chrysidoidea, vespidae, rhopalosomatidae, pompilidae, mutillidae, tiphiidae, chyphotidae, scolioidea, apoidea, formicidae, myrmicinae, ectatomminae, heteroponerinae, formicinae, dolichoderinae, aneuretinae, pseudomyrmecinae, myrmeciinae, dorylinae, ponerinae, agroecomyrmecinae, paraponerinae, proceratiinae, amblyoponinae, apomyrminae, leptanillinae, martialinae, cerapachyinae, is, paraphyletic, in, 1966, e, o, wilson, and, his, colleagues, identified, the, fossil, remains, of, an, ant, sphecomyrma, that, lived, in, the, cretaceous, period, the, specimen, trapped, in, amber, dating, back, to, around, 92, million, years, ago, has, features, found, in, some, wasps, but, not, found, in, modern, ants, the, oldest, fossils, of, ants, date, to, the, mid, cretaceous, around, 100, million, years, ago, which, belong, to, extinct, stem, groups, such, as, the, haidomyrmecinae, sphecomyrminae, and, zigrasimeciinae, with, modern, ant, subfamilies, appearing, towards, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, around, 80, 70, million, years, ago, ants, diversified, extensively, during, the, angiosperm, terrestrial, revolution, and, assumed, ecological, dominance, around, 60, million, years, ago, some, groups, such, as, the, leptanillinae, and, martialinae, are, suggested, to, have, diversified, from, early, primitive, ants, that, were, likely, to, have, been, predators, underneath, the, surface, of, the, soil, during, the, cretaceous, period, a, few, species, of, primitive, ants, ranged, widely, on, the, laurasian, supercontinent, the, northern, hemisphere, their, representation, in, the, fossil, record, is, poor, in, comparison, to, the, populations, of, other, insects, representing, only, about, 1, of, fossil, evidence, of, insects, in, the, era, ants, became, dominant, after, adaptive, radiation, at, the, beginning, of, the, paleogene, period, by, the, oligocene, and, miocene, ants, had, come, to, represent, 20, 40, of, all, insects, found, in, major, fossil, deposits, of, the, species, that, lived, in, the, eocene, epoch, around, one, in, 10, genera, survive, to, the, present, genera, surviving, today, comprise, 56, of, the, genera, in, baltic, amber, fossils, early, oligocene, and, 92, of, the, genera, in, dominican, amber, fossils, apparently, early, miocene, termites, live, in, colonies, and, are, sometimes, called, white, ants, but, termites, are, only, distantly, related, to, ants, they, are, the, sub, order, isoptera, and, together, with, cockroaches, they, form, the, order, blattodea, blattodeans, are, related, to, mantids, crickets, and, other, winged, insects, that, do, not, undergo, complete, metamorphosis, like, ants, termites, are, eusocial, with, sterile, workers, but, they, differ, greatly, in, the, genetics, of, reproduction, the, similarity, of, their, social, structure, to, that, of, ants, is, attributed, to, convergent, evolution, velvet, ants, look, like, large, ants, but, are, wingless, female, wasps, ants, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, they, are, found, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, and, only, a, few, large, islands, such, as, greenland, iceland, parts, of, polynesia, and, the, hawaiian, islands, lack, native, ant, species, ants, occupy, a, wide, range, of, ecological, niches, and, exploit, many, different, food, resources, as, direct, or, indirect, herbivores, predators, and, scavengers, most, ant, species, are, omnivorous, generalists, but, a, few, are, specialist, feeders, there, is, considerable, variation, in, ant, abundance, across, habitats, peaking, in, the, moist, tropics, to, nearly, six, times, that, found, in, less, suitable, habitats, their, ecological, dominance, has, been, examined, primarily, using, estimates, of, their, biomass, myrmecologist, e, o, wilson, had, estimated, in, 2009, that, at, any, one, time, the, total, number, of, ants, was, between, one, and, ten, quadrillion, short, scale, i, e, between, 10, 15, and, 10, 16, and, using, this, estimate, he, had, suggested, that, the, total, biomass, of, all, the, ants, in, the, world, was, approximately, equal, to, the, total, biomass, of, the, entire, human, race, more, careful, estimates, made, in, 2022, which, take, into, account, regional, variations, puts, the, global, ant, contribution, at, 12, megatons, of, dry, carbon, which, is, about, 20, of, the, total, human, contribution, but, greater, than, that, of, the, wild, birds, and, mammals, combined, this, study, also, puts, a, conservative, estimate, of, the, ants, at, about, 20, 10, 15, 20, quadrillion, ants, range, in, size, from, 0, 75, to, 52, millimetres, 0, 030, 2, 0, in, the, largest, species, being, the, fossil, titanomyrma, giganteum, the, queen, of, which, was, 6, cm, 2, 1, 2, in, long, with, a, wingspan, of, 15, cm, 6, in, ants, vary, in, colour, most, ants, are, yellow, to, red, or, brown, to, black, but, a, few, species, are, green, and, some, tropical, species, have, a, metallic, lustre, more, than, 13, 800, species, are, currently, known, with, upper, estimates, of, the, potential, existence, of, about, 22, 000, see, the, article, list, of, ant, genera, with, the, greatest, diversity, in, the, tropics, taxonomic, studies, continue, to, resolve, the, classification, and, systematics, of, ants, online, databases, of, ant, species, including, antweb, and, the, hymenoptera, name, server, help, to, keep, track, of, the, known, and, newly, described, species, the, relative, ease, with, which, ants, may, be, sampled, and, studied, in, ecosystems, has, made, them, useful, as, indicator, species, in, biodiversity, studies, ants, are, distinct, in, their, morphology, from, other, insects, in, having, geniculate, elbowed, antennae, metapleural, glands, and, a, strong, constriction, of, their, second, abdominal, segment, into, a, node, like, petiole, the, head, mesosoma, and, metasoma, are, the, three, distinct, body, segments, formally, tagmata, the, petiole, forms, a, narrow, waist, between, their, mesosoma, thorax, plus, the, first, abdominal, segment, which, is, fused, to, it, and, gaster, abdomen, less, the, abdominal, segments, in, the, petiole, the, petiole, may, be, formed, by, one, or, two, nodes, the, second, alone, or, the, second, and, third, abdominal, segments, tergosternal, fusion, when, the, tergite, and, sternite, of, a, segment, fuse, together, can, occur, partly, or, fully, on, the, second, third, and, fourth, abdominal, segment, and, is, used, in, identification, fourth, abdominal, tergosternal, fusion, was, formerly, used, as, character, that, defined, the, poneromorph, subfamilies, ponerinae, and, relatives, within, their, clade, but, this, is, no, longer, considered, a, synapomorphic, character, like, other, arthropods, ants, have, an, exoskeleton, an, external, covering, that, provides, a, protective, casing, around, the, body, and, a, point, of, attachment, for, muscles, in, contrast, to, the, internal, skeletons, of, humans, and, other, vertebrates, insects, do, not, have, lungs, oxygen, and, other, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, pass, through, their, exoskeleton, via, tiny, valves, called, spiracles, insects, also, lack, closed, blood, vessels, instead, they, have, a, long, thin, perforated, tube, along, the, top, of, the, body, called, the, dorsal, aorta, that, functions, like, a, heart, and, pumps, haemolymph, toward, the, head, thus, driving, the, circulation, of, the, internal, fluids, the, nervous, system, consists, of, a, ventral, nerve, cord, that, runs, the, length, of, the, body, with, several, ganglia, and, branches, along, the, way, reaching, into, the, extremities, of, the, appendages, an, ant, s, head, contains, many, sensory, organs, like, most, insects, ants, have, compound, eyes, made, from, numerous, tiny, lenses, attached, together, ant, eyes, are, good, for, acute, movement, detection, but, do, not, offer, a, high, resolution, image, they, also, have, three, small, ocelli, simple, eyes, on, the, top, of, the, head, that, detect, light, levels, and, polarization, compared, to, vertebrates, ants, tend, to, have, blurrier, eyesight, particularly, in, smaller, species, and, a, few, subterranean, taxa, are, completely, blind, however, some, ants, such, as, australia, s, bulldog, ant, have, excellent, vision, and, are, capable, of, discriminating, the, distance, and, size, of, objects, moving, nearly, a, meter, away, based, on, experiments, conducted, to, test, their, ability, differentiate, between, selected, wavelengths, of, light, some, ant, species, such, as, camponotus, blandus, solenopsis, invicta, and, formica, cunicularia, are, thought, to, possess, a, degree, of, colour, vision, two, antennae, feelers, are, attached, to, the, head, these, organs, detect, chemicals, air, currents, and, vibrations, they, also, are, used, to, transmit, and, receive, signals, through, touch, the, head, has, two, strong, jaws, the, mandibles, used, to, carry, food, manipulate, objects, construct, nests, and, for, defence, in, some, species, a, small, pocket, infrabuccal, chamber, inside, the, mouth, stores, food, so, it, may, be, passed, to, other, ants, or, their, larvae, both, the, legs, and, wings, of, the, ant, are, attached, to, the, mesosoma, thorax, the, legs, terminate, in, a, hooked, claw, which, allows, them, to, hook, on, and, climb, surfaces, only, reproductive, ants, queens, and, males, have, wings, queens, shed, their, wings, after, the, nuptial, flight, leaving, visible, stubs, a, distinguishing, feature, of, queens, in, a, few, species, wingless, queens, ergatoids, and, males, occur, the, metasoma, the, abdomen, of, the, ant, houses, important, internal, organs, including, those, of, the, reproductive, respiratory, tracheae, and, excretory, systems, workers, of, many, species, have, their, egg, laying, structures, modified, into, stings, that, are, used, for, subduing, prey, and, defending, their, nests, in, the, colonies, of, a, few, ant, species, there, are, physical, castes, workers, in, distinct, size, classes, called, minor, micrergates, median, and, major, ergates, macrergates, often, the, larger, ants, have, disproportionately, larger, heads, and, correspondingly, stronger, mandibles, although, formally, known, as, dinergates, such, individuals, are, sometimes, called, soldier, ants, because, their, stronger, mandibles, make, them, more, effective, in, fighting, although, they, still, are, workers, and, their, duties, typically, do, not, vary, greatly, from, the, minor, or, median, workers, in, a, few, species, the, median, workers, are, absent, creating, a, sharp, divide, between, the, minors, and, majors, weaver, ants, for, example, have, a, distinct, bimodal, size, distribution, some, other, species, show, continuous, variation, in, the, size, of, workers, the, smallest, and, largest, workers, in, carebara, diversa, show, nearly, a, 500, fold, difference, in, their, dry, weights, workers, cannot, mate, however, because, of, the, haplodiploid, sex, determination, system, in, ants, workers, of, a, number, of, species, can, lay, unfertilised, eggs, that, become, fully, fertile, haploid, males, the, role, of, workers, may, change, with, their, age, and, in, some, species, such, as, honeypot, ants, young, workers, are, fed, until, their, gasters, are, distended, and, act, as, living, food, storage, vessels, these, food, storage, workers, are, called, repletes, for, instance, these, replete, workers, develop, in, the, north, american, honeypot, ant, myrmecocystus, mexicanus, usually, the, largest, workers, in, the, colony, develop, into, repletes, and, if, repletes, are, removed, from, the, colony, other, workers, become, repletes, demonstrating, the, flexibility, of, this, particular, polymorphism, this, polymorphism, in, morphology, and, behaviour, of, workers, initially, was, thought, to, be, determined, by, environmental, factors, such, as, nutrition, and, hormones, that, led, to, different, developmental, paths, however, genetic, differences, between, worker, castes, have, been, noted, in, acromyrmex, sp, these, polymorphisms, are, caused, by, relatively, small, genetic, changes, differences, in, a, single, gene, of, solenopsis, invicta, can, decide, whether, the, colony, will, have, single, or, multiple, queens, the, australian, jack, jumper, ant, myrmecia, pilosula, has, only, a, single, pair, of, chromosomes, with, the, males, having, just, one, chromosome, as, they, are, haploid, the, lowest, number, known, for, any, animal, making, it, an, interesting, subject, for, studies, in, the, genetics, and, developmental, biology, of, social, insects, genome, size, is, a, fundamental, characteristic, of, an, organism, ants, have, been, found, to, have, tiny, genomes, with, the, evolution, of, genome, size, suggested, to, occur, through, loss, and, accumulation, of, non, coding, regions, mainly, transposable, elements, and, occasionally, by, whole, genome, duplication, this, may, be, related, to, colonisation, processes, but, further, studies, are, needed, to, verify, this, the, life, of, an, ant, starts, from, an, egg, if, the, egg, is, fertilised, the, progeny, will, be, female, diploid, if, not, it, will, be, male, haploid, ants, develop, by, complete, metamorphosis, with, the, larva, stages, passing, through, a, pupal, stage, before, emerging, as, an, adult, the, larva, is, largely, immobile, and, is, fed, and, cared, for, by, workers, food, is, given, to, the, larvae, by, trophallaxis, a, process, in, which, an, ant, regurgitates, liquid, food, held, in, its, crop, this, is, also, how, adults, share, food, stored, in, the, social, stomach, larvae, especially, in, the, later, stages, may, also, be, provided, solid, food, such, as, trophic, eggs, pieces, of, prey, and, seeds, brought, by, workers, the, larvae, grow, through, a, series, of, four, or, five, moults, and, enter, the, pupal, stage, the, pupa, has, the, appendages, free, and, not, fused, to, the, body, as, in, a, butterfly, pupa, the, differentiation, into, queens, and, workers, which, are, both, female, and, different, castes, of, workers, is, influenced, in, some, species, by, the, nutrition, the, larvae, obtain, genetic, influences, and, the, control, of, gene, expression, by, the, developmental, environment, are, complex, and, the, determination, of, caste, continues, to, be, a, subject, of, research, winged, male, ants, called, drones, termed, aner, in, old, literature, emerge, from, pupae, along, with, the, usually, winged, breeding, females, some, species, such, as, army, ants, have, wingless, queens, larvae, and, pupae, need, to, be, kept, at, fairly, constant, temperatures, to, ensure, proper, development, and, so, often, are, moved, around, among, the, various, brood, chambers, within, the, colony, a, new, ergate, spends, the, first, few, days, of, its, adult, life, caring, for, the, queen, and, young, she, then, graduates, to, digging, and, other, nest, work, and, later, to, defending, the, nest, and, foraging, these, changes, are, sometimes, fairly, sudden, and, define, what, are, called, temporal, castes, such, age, based, task, specialization, or, polyethism, has, been, suggested, as, having, evolved, due, to, the, high, casualties, involved, in, foraging, and, defence, making, it, an, acceptable, risk, only, for, ants, who, are, older, and, likely, to, die, sooner, from, natural, causes, in, the, brazilian, ant, forelius, pusillus, the, nest, entrance, is, closed, from, the, outside, to, protect, the, colony, from, predatory, ant, species, at, sunset, each, day, about, one, to, eight, workers, seal, the, nest, entrance, from, the, outside, and, they, have, no, chance, of, returning, to, the, nest, and, are, in, effect, sacrificed, whether, these, seemingly, suicidal, workers, are, older, workers, has, not, been, determined, ant, colonies, can, be, long, lived, the, queens, can, live, for, up, to, 30, years, and, workers, live, from, 1, to, 3, years, males, however, are, more, transitory, being, quite, short, lived, and, surviving, for, only, a, few, weeks, ant, queens, are, estimated, to, live, 100, times, as, long, as, solitary, insects, of, a, similar, size, ants, are, active, all, year, long, in, the, tropics, however, in, cooler, regions, they, survive, the, winter, in, a, state, of, dormancy, known, as, hibernation, the, forms, of, inactivity, are, varied, and, some, temperate, species, have, larvae, going, into, the, inactive, state, diapause, while, in, others, the, adults, alone, pass, the, winter, in, a, state, of, reduced, activity, a, wide, range, of, reproductive, strategies, have, been, noted, in, ant, species, females, of, many, species, are, known, to, be, capable, of, reproducing, asexually, through, thelytokous, parthenogenesis, secretions, from, the, male, accessory, glands, in, some, species, can, plug, the, female, genital, opening, and, prevent, females, from, re, mating, most, ant, species, have, a, system, in, which, only, the, queen, and, breeding, females, have, the, ability, to, mate, contrary, to, popular, belief, some, ant, nests, have, multiple, queens, while, others, may, exist, without, queens, workers, with, the, ability, to, reproduce, are, called, gamergates, and, colonies, that, lack, queens, are, then, called, gamergate, colonies, colonies, with, queens, are, said, to, be, queen, right, drones, can, also, mate, with, existing, queens, by, entering, a, foreign, colony, such, as, in, army, ants, when, the, drone, is, initially, attacked, by, the, workers, it, releases, a, mating, pheromone, if, recognized, as, a, mate, it, will, be, carried, to, the, queen, to, mate, males, may, also, patrol, the, nest, and, fight, others, by, grabbing, them, with, their, mandibles, piercing, their, exoskeleton, and, then, marking, them, with, a, pheromone, the, marked, male, is, interpreted, as, an, invader, by, worker, ants, and, is, killed, most, ants, are, univoltine, producing, a, new, generation, each, year, during, the, species, specific, breeding, period, winged, females, and, winged, males, known, to, entomologists, as, alates, leave, the, colony, in, what, is, called, a, nuptial, flight, the, nuptial, flight, usually, takes, place, in, the, late, spring, or, early, summer, when, the, weather, is, hot, and, humid, heat, makes, flying, easier, and, freshly, fallen, rain, makes, the, ground, softer, for, mated, queens, to, dig, nests, males, typically, take, flight, before, the, females, males, then, use, visual, cues, to, find, a, common, mating, ground, for, example, a, landmark, such, as, a, pine, tree, to, which, other, males, in, the, area, converge, males, secrete, a, mating, pheromone, that, females, follow, males, will, mount, females, in, the, air, but, the, actual, mating, process, usually, takes, place, on, the, ground, females, of, some, species, mate, with, just, one, male, but, in, others, they, may, mate, with, as, many, as, ten, or, more, different, males, storing, the, sperm, in, their, spermathecae, the, genus, cardiocondyla, have, species, with, both, winged, and, wingless, males, where, the, latter, will, only, mate, with, females, living, in, the, same, nest, some, species, in, the, genus, have, lost, winged, males, completely, and, only, produce, wingless, males, in, c, elegans, workers, may, transport, newly, emerged, queens, to, other, conspecific, nests, where, the, wingless, males, from, unrelated, colonies, can, mate, with, them, a, behavioural, adaptation, that, may, reduce, the, chances, of, inbreeding, mated, females, then, seek, a, suitable, place, to, begin, a, colony, there, they, break, off, their, wings, using, their, tibial, spurs, and, begin, to, lay, and, care, for, eggs, the, females, can, selectively, fertilise, future, eggs, with, the, sperm, stored, to, produce, diploid, workers, or, lay, unfertilized, haploid, eggs, to, produce, drones, the, first, workers, to, hatch, known, as, nanitics, are, weaker, and, smaller, than, later, workers, but, they, begin, to, serve, the, colony, immediately, they, enlarge, the, nest, forage, for, food, and, care, for, the, other, eggs, species, that, have, multiple, queens, may, have, a, queen, leaving, the, nest, along, with, some, workers, to, found, a, colony, at, a, new, site, a, process, akin, to, swarming, in, honeybees, the, typical, ant, species, has, a, colony, occupying, a, single, nest, housing, one, or, more, queens, where, the, brood, is, raised, there, are, however, more, than, 150, species, of, ants, in, 49, genera, that, are, known, to, have, colonies, consisting, of, multiple, spatially, separated, nests, these, polydomous, as, opposed, to, monodomous, colonies, have, food, and, workers, moving, between, the, nests, membership, to, a, colony, is, identified, by, the, response, of, worker, ants, which, identify, whether, another, individual, belongs, to, their, own, colony, or, not, a, signature, cocktail, of, body, surface, chemicals, also, known, as, cuticular, hydrocarbons, or, chcs, forms, the, so, called, colony, odor, which, other, members, can, recognize, some, ant, species, appear, to, be, less, discriminating, and, in, the, argentine, ant, linepithema, humile, workers, carried, from, a, colony, anywhere, in, the, southern, us, and, mexico, are, acceptable, within, other, colonies, in, the, same, region, similarly, workers, from, colonies, that, have, established, in, europe, are, accepted, by, any, other, colonies, within, europe, but, not, by, the, colonies, in, the, americas, the, interpretation, of, these, observations, has, been, debated, and, some, have, been, termed, these, large, populations, as, supercolonies, while, others, have, termed, the, populations, as, unicolonial, ants, communicate, with, each, other, using, pheromones, sounds, and, touch, since, most, ants, live, on, the, ground, they, use, the, soil, surface, to, leave, pheromone, trails, that, may, be, followed, by, other, ants, in, species, that, forage, in, groups, a, forager, that, finds, food, marks, a, trail, on, the, way, back, to, the, colony, this, trail, is, followed, by, other, ants, these, ants, then, reinforce, the, trail, when, they, head, back, with, food, to, the, colony, when, the, food, source, is, exhausted, no, new, trails, are, marked, by, returning, ants, and, the, scent, slowly, dissipates, this, behaviour, helps, ants, deal, with, changes, in, their, environment, for, instance, when, an, established, path, to, a, food, source, is, blocked, by, an, obstacle, the, foragers, leave, the, path, to, explore, new, routes, if, an, ant, is, successful, it, leaves, a, new, trail, marking, the, shortest, route, on, its, return, successful, trails, are, followed, by, more, ants, reinforcing, better, routes, and, gradually, identifying, the, best, path, ants, use, pheromones, for, more, than, just, making, trails, a, crushed, ant, emits, an, alarm, pheromone, that, sends, nearby, ants, into, an, attack, frenzy, and, attracts, more, ants, from, farther, away, several, ant, species, even, use, propaganda, pheromones, to, confuse, enemy, ants, and, make, them, fight, among, themselves, pheromones, are, produced, by, a, wide, range, of, structures, including, dufour, s, glands, poison, glands, and, glands, on, the, hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and, hind, tibia, pheromones, also, are, exchanged, mixed, with, food, and, passed, by, trophallaxis, transferring, information, within, the, colony, this, allows, other, ants, to, detect, what, task, group, e, g, foraging, or, nest, maintenance, other, colony, members, belong, to, in, ant, species, with, queen, castes, when, the, dominant, queen, stops, producing, a, specific, pheromone, workers, begin, to, raise, new, queens, in, the, colony, some, ants, produce, sounds, by, stridulation, using, the, gaster, segments, and, their, mandibles, sounds, may, be, used, to, communicate, with, colony, members, or, with, other, species, ants, attack, and, defend, themselves, by, biting, and, in, many, species, by, stinging, often, injecting, or, spraying, chemicals, bullet, ants, paraponera, located, in, central, and, south, america, are, considered, to, have, the, most, painful, sting, of, any, insect, although, it, is, usually, not, fatal, to, humans, this, sting, is, given, the, highest, rating, on, the, schmidt, sting, pain, index, the, sting, of, jack, jumper, ants, can, be, lethal, for, humans, and, an, antivenom, has, been, developed, for, it, fire, ants, solenopsis, spp, are, unique, in, having, a, venom, sac, containing, piperidine, alkaloids, their, stings, are, painful, and, can, be, dangerous, to, hypersensitive, people, formicine, ants, secrete, a, poison, from, their, glands, made, mainly, of, formic, acid, trap, jaw, ants, of, the, genus, odontomachus, are, equipped, with, mandibles, called, trap, jaws, which, snap, shut, faster, than, any, other, predatory, appendages, within, the, animal, kingdom, one, study, of, odontomachus, bauri, recorded, peak, speeds, of, between, 126, and, 230, km, h, 78, and, 143, mph, with, the, jaws, closing, within, 130, microseconds, on, average, the, ants, were, also, observed, to, use, their, jaws, as, a, catapult, to, eject, intruders, or, fling, themselves, backward, to, escape, a, threat, before, striking, the, ant, opens, its, mandibles, extremely, widely, and, locks, them, in, this,

on, the, inside, of, the, mandibles, the, mandibles, also, permit, slow, and, fine, movements, for, other, tasks, trap, jaws, also, are, seen, in, other, ponerines, such, as, anochetus, as, well, as, some, genera, in, the, tribe, attini, such, as, daceton, orectognathus, and, strumigenys, which, are, viewed, as, examples, of, convergent, evolution, a, malaysian, species, of, ant, in, the, camponotus, cylindricus, group, has, enlarged, mandibular, glands, that, extend, into, their, gaster, if, combat, takes, a, turn, for, the, worse, a, worker, may, perform, a, final, act, of, suicidal,

are, built, by, many, ant, species, but, other, species, are, nomadic, and, do, not, build, permanent, structures, ants, may, form, subterranean, nests, or, build, them, on, trees, these, nests, may, be, found, in, the, ground, under, stones, or, logs, inside, logs, hollow, stems, or, even, acorns, the, materials, used, for, construction, include, soil, and, plant, matter, and, ants, carefully, select, their, nest, sites, temnothorax, albipennis, will, avoid, sites, with, dead, ants, as, these, may, indicate, the, presence, of, pests, or, disease, they, are, quick, to, abandon, established, nests, at, the, first, sign, of, threats, the, army, ants, of, south, america, such, as, the, eciton, burchellii, species, and, the, driver, ants, of, africa, do, not, build, permanent, nests, but, instead, alternate, between, nomadism, and, stages, where, the, workers, form, a, temporary, nest, bivouac, from, their, own, bodies, by, holding, each, other, together, weaver, ant, oecophylla, spp, workers, build, nests, in, trees, by, attaching, leaves, together, first, pulling, them, together, with, bridges, of, workers, and, then, inducing, their, larvae, to, produce, silk, as, they, are, moved, along, the, leaf, edges, similar, forms, of, nest, construction, are, seen, in, some, species, of, polyrhachis, formica, polyctena, among, other, ant, species, constructs, nests, that, maintain, a, relatively, constant, interior, temperature, that, aids, in, the, development, of, larvae, the, ants, maintain, the, nest, temperature, by, choosing, the, location, nest, materials, controlling, ventilation, and, maintaining, the, heat, from, solar, radiation, worker, activity, and, metabolism, and, in, some, moist, nests, microbial, activity, in, the, nest, materials, some, ant, species, such, as, those, that, use, natural, cavities, can, be, opportunistic, and, make, use, of, the, controlled, micro, climate, provided, inside, human, dwellings, and, other, artificial, structures, to, house, their, colonies, and, nest, structures, most, ants, are, generalist, predators, scavengers, and, indirect, herbivores, but, a, few, have, evolved, specialised, ways, of, obtaining, nutrition, it, is, believed, that, many, ant, species, that, engage, in, indirect, herbivory, rely, on, specialized, symbiosis, with, their, gut, microbes, to, upgrade, the, nutritional, value, of, the, food, they, collect, and, allow, them, to, survive, in, nitrogen, poor, regions, such, as, rainforest, canopies, leafcutter, ants, atta, and, acromyrmex, feed, exclusively, on, a, fungus, that, grows, only, within, their, colonies, they, continually, collect, leaves, which, are, taken, to, the, colony, cut, into, tiny, pieces, and, placed, in, fungal, gardens, ergates, specialise, in, related, tasks, according, to, their, sizes, the, largest, ants, cut, stalks, smaller, workers, chew, the, leaves, and, the, smallest, tend, the, fungus, leafcutter, ants, are, sensitive, enough, to, recognise, the, reaction, of, the, fungus, to, different, plant, material, apparently, detecting, chemical, signals, from, the, fungus, if, a, particular, type, of, leaf, is, found, to, be, toxic, to, the, fungus, the, colony, will, no, longer, collect, it, the, ants, feed, on, structures, produced, by, the, fungi, called, gongylidia, symbiotic, bacteria, on, the, exterior, surface, of, the, ants, produce, antibiotics, that, kill, bacteria, introduced, into, the, nest, that, may, harm, the, fungi, foraging, ants, travel, distances, of, up, to, 200, metres, 700, ft, from, their, nest, and, scent, trails, allow, them, to, find, their, way, back, even, in, the, dark, in, hot, and, arid, regions, day, foraging, ants, face, death, by, desiccation, so, the, ability, to, find, the, shortest, route, back, to, the, nest, reduces, that, risk, diurnal, desert, ants, of, the, genus, cataglyphis, such, as, the, sahara, desert, ant, navigate, by, keeping, track, of, direction, as, well, as, distance, travelled, distances, travelled, are, measured, using, an, internal, pedometer, that, keeps, count, of, the, steps, taken, and, also, by, evaluating, the, movement, of, objects, in, their, visual, field, optical, flow, directions, are, measured, using, the, position, of, the, sun, they, integrate, this, information, to, find, the, shortest, route, back, to, their, nest, like, all, ants, they, can, also, make, use, of, visual, landmarks, when, available, as, well, as, olfactory, and, tactile, cues, to, navigate, some, species, of, ant, are, able, to, use, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, for, navigation, the, compound, eyes, of, ants, have, specialised, cells, that, detect, polarised, light, from, the, sun, which, is, used, to, determine, direction, these, polarization, detectors, are, sensitive, in, the, ultraviolet, region, of, the, light, spectrum, in, some, army, ant, species, a, group, of, foragers, who, become, separated, from, the, main, column, may, sometimes, turn, back, on, themselves, and, form, a, circular, ant, mill, the, workers, may, then, run, around, continuously, until, they, die, of, exhaustion, the, female, worker, ants, do, not, have, wings, and, reproductive, females, lose, their, wings, after, their, mating, flights, in, order, to, begin, their, colonies, therefore, unlike, their, wasp, ancestors, most, ants, travel, by, walking, some, species, are, capable, of, leaping, for, example, jerdon, s, jumping, ant, harpegnathos, saltator, is, able, to, jump, by, synchronising, the, action, of, its, mid, and, hind, pairs, of, legs, there, are, several, species, of, gliding, ant, including, cephalotes, atratus, this, may, be, a, common, trait, among, arboreal, ants, with, small, colonies, ants, with, this, ability, are, able, to, control, their, horizontal, movement, so, as, to, catch, tree, trunks, when, they, fall, from, atop, the, forest, canopy, other, species, of, ants, can, form, chains, to, bridge, gaps, over, water, underground, or, through, spaces, in, vegetation, some, species, also, form, floating, rafts, that, help, them, survive, floods, these, rafts, may, also, have, a, role, in, allowing, ants, to, colonise, islands, polyrhachis, sokolova, a, species, of, ant, found, in, australian, mangrove, swamps, can, swim, and, live, in, underwater, nests, since, they, lack, gills, they, go, to, trapped, pockets, of, air, in, the, submerged, nests, to, breathe, not, all, ants, have, the, same, kind, of, societies, the, australian, bulldog, ants, are, among, the, biggest, and, most, basal, of, ants, like, virtually, all, ants, they, are, eusocial, but, their, social, behaviour, is, poorly, developed, compared, to, other, species, each, individual, hunts, alone, using, her, large, eyes, instead, of, chemical, senses, to, find, prey, some, species, attack, and, take, over, neighbouring, ant, colonies, extreme, specialists, among, these, slave, raiding, ants, such, as, the, amazon, ants, are, incapable, of, feeding, themselves, and, need, captured, workers, to, survive, captured, workers, of, enslaved, temnothorax, species, have, evolved, a, counter, strategy, destroying, just, the, female, pupae, of, the, slave, making, temnothorax, americanus, but, sparing, the, males, who, do, not, take, part, in, slave, raiding, as, adults, ants, identify, kin, and, nestmates, through, their, scent, which, comes, from, hydrocarbon, laced, secretions, that, coat, their, exoskeletons, if, an, ant, is, separated, from, its, original, colony, it, will, eventually, lose, the, colony, scent, any, ant, that, enters, a, colony, without, a, matching, scent, will, be, attacked, parasitic, ant, species, enter, the, colonies, of, host, ants, and, establish, themselves, as, social, parasites, species, such, as, strumigenys, xenos, are, entirely, parasitic, and, do, not, have, workers, but, instead, rely, on, the, food, gathered, by, their, strumigenys, perplexa, hosts, this, form, of, parasitism, is, seen, across, many, ant, genera, but, the, parasitic, ant, is, usually, a, species, that, is, closely, related, to, its, host, a, variety, of, methods, are, employed, to, enter, the, nest, of, the, host, ant, a, parasitic, queen, may, enter, the, host, nest, before, the, first, brood, has, hatched, establishing, herself, prior, to, development, of, a, colony, scent, other, species, use, pheromones, to, confuse, the, host, ants, or, to, trick, them, into, carrying, the, parasitic, queen, into, the, nest, some, simply, fight, their, way, into, the, nest, a, conflict, between, the, sexes, of, a, species, is, seen, in, some, species, of, ants, with, these, reproducers, apparently, competing, to, produce, offspring, that, are, as, closely, related, to, them, as, possible, the, most, extreme, form, involves, the, production, of, clonal, offspring, an, extreme, of, sexual, conflict, is, seen, in, wasmannia, auropunctata, where, the, queens, produce, diploid, daughters, by, thelytokous, parthenogenesis, and, males, produce, clones, by, a, process, whereby, a, diploid, egg, loses, its, maternal, contribution, to, produce, haploid, males, who, are, clones, of, the, father, ants, form, symbiotic, associations, with, a, range, of, species, including, other, ant, species, other, insects, plants, and, fungi, they, also, are, preyed, on, by, many, animals, and, even, certain, fungi, some, arthropod, species, spend, part, of, their, lives, within, ant, nests, either, preying, on, ants, their, larvae, and, eggs, consuming, the, food, stores, of, the, ants, or, avoiding, predators, these, inquilines, may, bear, a, close, resemblance, to, ants, the, nature, of, this, ant, mimicry, myrmecomorphy, varies, with, some, cases, involving, batesian, mimicry, where, the, mimic, reduces, the, risk, of, predation, others, show, wasmannian, mimicry, a, form, of, mimicry, seen, only, in, inquilines, aphids, and, other, hemipteran, insects, secrete, a, sweet, liquid, called, honeydew, when, they, feed, on, plant, sap, the, sugars, in, honeydew, are, a, high, energy, food, source, which, many, ant, species, collect, in, some, cases, the, aphids, secrete, the, honeydew, in, response, to, ants, tapping, them, with, their, antennae, the, ants, in, turn, keep, predators, away, from, the, aphids, and, will, move, them, from, one, feeding, location, to, another, when, migrating, to, a, new, area, many, colonies, will, take, the, aphids, with, them, to, ensure, a, continued, supply, of, honeydew, ants, also, tend, mealybugs, to, harvest, their, honeydew, mealybugs, may, become, a, serious, pest, of, pineapples, if, ants, are, present, to, protect, mealybugs, from, their, natural, enemies, myrmecophilous, ant, loving, caterpillars, of, the, butterfly, family, lycaenidae, e, g, blues, coppers, or, hairstreaks, are, herded, by, the, ants, led, to, feeding, areas, in, the, daytime, and, brought, inside, the, ants, nest, at, night, the, caterpillars, have, a, gland, which, secretes, honeydew, when, the, ants, massage, them, some, caterpillars, produce, vibrations, and, sounds, that, are, perceived, by, the, ants, a, similar, adaptation, can, be, seen, in, grizzled, skipper, butterflies, that, emit, vibrations, by, expanding, their, wings, in, order, to, communicate, with, ants, which, are, natural, predators, of, these, butterflies, other, caterpillars, have, evolved, from, ant, loving, to, ant, eating, these, myrmecophagous, caterpillars, secrete, a, pheromone, that, makes, the, ants, act, as, if, the, caterpillar, is, one, of, their, own, larvae, the, caterpillar, is, then, taken, into, the, ant, nest, where, it, feeds, on, the, ant, larvae, a, number, of, specialized, bacteria, have, been, found, as, endosymbionts, in, ant, guts, some, of, the, dominant, bacteria, belong, to, the, order, hyphomicrobiales, whose, members, are, known, for, being, nitrogen, fixing, symbionts, in, legumes, but, the, species, found, in, ant, lack, the, ability, to, fix, nitrogen, fungus, growing, ants, that, make, up, the, tribe, attini, including, leafcutter, ants, cultivate, certain, species, of, fungus, in, the, genera, leucoagaricus, or, leucocoprinus, of, the, family, agaricaceae, in, this, ant, fungus, mutualism, both, species, depend, on, each, other, for, survival, the, ant, allomerus, decemarticulatus, has, evolved, a, three, way, association, with, the, host, plant, hirtella, physophora, chrysobalanaceae, and, a, sticky, fungus, which, is, used, to, trap, their, insect, prey, lemon, ants, make, devil, s, gardens, by, killing, surrounding, plants, with, their, stings, and, leaving, a, pure, patch, of, lemon, ant, trees, duroia, hirsuta, this, modification, of, the, forest, provides, the, ants, with, more, nesting, sites, inside, the, stems, of, the, duroia, trees, although, some, ants, obtain, nectar, from, flowers, pollination, by, ants, is, somewhat, rare, one, example, being, of, the, pollination, of, the, orchid, leporella, fimbriata, which, induces, male, myrmecia, urens, to, pseudocopulate, with, the, flowers, transferring, pollen, in, the, process, one, theory, that, has, been, proposed, for, the, rarity, of, pollination, is, that, the, secretions, of, the, metapleural, gland, inactivate, and, reduce, the, viability, of, pollen, some, plants, mostly, angiosperms, but, also, some, ferns, have, special, nectar, exuding, structures, extrafloral, nectaries, that, provide, food, for, ants, which, in, turn, protect, the, plant, from, more, damaging, herbivorous, insects, species, such, as, the, bullhorn, acacia, acacia, cornigera, in, central, america, have, hollow, thorns, that, house, colonies, of, stinging, ants, pseudomyrmex, ferruginea, who, defend, the, tree, against, insects, browsing, mammals, and, epiphytic, vines, isotopic, labelling, studies, suggest, that, plants, also, obtain, nitrogen, from, the, ants, in, return, the, ants, obtain, food, from, protein, and, lipid, rich, beltian, bodies, in, fiji, philidris, nagasau, dolichoderinae, are, known, to, selectively, grow, species, of, epiphytic, squamellaria, rubiaceae, which, produce, large, domatia, inside, which, the, ant, colonies, nest, the, ants, plant, the, seeds, and, the, domatia, of, young, seedling, are, immediately, occupied, and, the, ant, faeces, in, them, contribute, to, rapid, growth, similar, dispersal, associations, are, found, with, other, dolichoderines, in, the, region, as, well, another, example, of, this, type, of, ectosymbiosis, comes, from, the, macaranga, tree, which, has, stems, adapted, to, house, colonies, of, crematogaster, ants, many, plant, species, have, seeds, that, are, adapted, for, dispersal, by, ants, seed, dispersal, by, ants, or, myrmecochory, is, widespread, and, new, estimates, suggest, that, nearly, 9, of, all, plant, species, may, have, such, ant, associations, often, seed, dispersing, ants, perform, directed, dispersal, depositing, the, seeds, in, locations, that, increase, the, likelihood, of, seed, survival, to, reproduction, some, plants, in, arid, fire, prone, systems, are, particularly, dependent, on, ants, for, their, survival, and, dispersal, as, the, seeds, are, transported, to, safety, below, the, ground, many, ant, dispersed, seeds, have, special, external, structures, elaiosomes, that, are, sought, after, by, ants, as, food, ants, can, substantially, alter, rate, of, decomposition, and, nutrient, cycling, in, their, nest, by, myrmecochory, and, modification, of, soil, conditions, they, substantially, alter, vegetation, and, nutrient, cycling, in, surrounding, ecosystem, a, convergence, possibly, a, form, of, mimicry, is, seen, in, the, eggs, of, stick, insects, they, have, an, edible, elaiosome, like, structure, and, are, taken, into, the, ant, nest, where, the, young, hatch, most, ants, are, predatory, and, some, prey, on, and, obtain, food, from, other, social, insects, including, other, ants, some, species, specialise, in, preying, on, termites, megaponera, and, termitopone, while, a, few, cerapachyinae, prey, on, other, ants, some, termites, including,
