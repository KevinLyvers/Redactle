millets, m, l, t, s, are, a, highly, varied, group, of, small, seeded, grasses, widely, grown, around, the, world, as, cereal, crops, or, grains, for, fodder, and, human, food, most, millets, belong, to, the, tribe, paniceae, millets, are, important, crops, in, the, semiarid, tropics, of, asia, and, africa, especially, in, india, mali, nigeria, and, niger, with, 97, of, production, in, developing, countries, the, crop, is, favored, for, its, productivity, and, short, growing, season, under, hot, dry, conditions, the, millets, are, sometimes, understood, to, include, the, widely, cultivated, sorghum, apart, from, that, pearl, millet, is, the, most, commonly, cultivated, of, the, millets, finger, millet, proso, millet, and, foxtail, millet, are, other, important, crop, species, millets, may, have, been, consumed, by, humans, for, about, 7, 000, years, and, potentially, had, a, pivotal, role, in, the, rise, of, multi, crop, agriculture, and, settled, farming, societies, etymologically, millet, is, a, term, derived, from, latin, millium, the, latin, name, for, these, plants, in, ancient, egyptian, millet, was, called, besha, or, be, t, in, coptic, b, shte, millets, are, small, grained, annual, warm, weather, cereals, belonging, to, the, grass, family, they, are, highly, tolerant, of, drought, and, other, extreme, weather, conditions, and, have, a, similar, nutrient, content, to, other, major, cereals, the, millets, are, closely, related, to, sorghum, and, maize, within, the, pacmad, clade, of, grasses, and, more, distantly, to, the, cereals, of, the, bop, clade, such, as, wheat, and, barley, bambusoideae, bamboos, fescue, ryegrass, hordeum, barley, triticum, wheat, secale, rye, oryza, rice, pennisetum, fountaingrasses, pearl, millet, millets, sorghum, sorghum, zea, maize, the, different, species, of, millets, are, not, all, closely, related, all, are, members, of, the, family, poaceae, the, grasses, but, they, belong, to, different, tribes, and, subfamilies, commonly, cultivated, millets, are, eragrostideae, tribe, in, the, subfamily, chloridoideae, paniceae, tribe, in, the, subfamily, panicoideae, andropogoneae, tribe, also, in, the, subfamily, panicoideae, specialized, archaeologists, called, palaeoethnobotanists, relying, on, data, such, as, the, relative, abundance, of, charred, grains, found, in, archaeological, sites, hypothesize, that, the, cultivation, of, millets, was, of, greater, prevalence, in, prehistory, than, rice, especially, in, northern, china, and, korea, the, cultivation, of, common, millet, as, the, earliest, dry, crop, in, east, asia, has, been, attributed, to, its, resistance, to, drought, and, this, has, been, suggested, to, have, aided, its, spread, asian, varieties, of, millet, made, their, way, from, china, to, the, black, sea, region, of, europe, by, 5000, bce, millet, was, growing, wild, in, greece, as, early, as, 3000, bce, and, bulk, storage, containers, for, millet, have, been, found, from, the, late, bronze, age, in, macedonia, and, northern, greece, hesiod, describes, that, the, beards, grow, round, the, millet, which, men, sow, in, summer, and, millet, is, listed, along, with, wheat, in, the, third, century, bce, by, theophrastus, in, his, enquiry, into, plants, proso, millet, panicum, miliaceum, and, foxtail, millet, setaria, italica, were, important, crops, beginning, in, the, early, neolithic, of, china, some, of, the, earliest, evidence, of, millet, cultivation, in, china, was, found, at, cishan, north, where, proso, millet, husk, phytoliths, and, biomolecular, components, have, been, identified, around, 10, 300, 8, 700, years, ago, in, storage, pits, along, with, remains, of, pit, houses, pottery, and, stone, tools, related, to, millet, cultivation, evidence, at, cishan, for, foxtail, millet, dates, back, to, around, 8, 700, years, ago, noodles, made, from, these, two, varieties, of, millet, were, found, under, a, 4, 000, year, old, earthenware, bowl, containing, well, preserved, noodles, at, the, lajia, archaeological, site, in, north, china, this, is, the, oldest, evidence, of, millet, noodles, in, china, palaeoethnobotanists, have, found, evidence, of, the, cultivation, of, millet, in, the, korean, peninsula, dating, to, the, middle, jeulmun, pottery, period, around, 3500, 2000, bce, millet, continued, to, be, an, important, element, in, the, intensive, multicropping, agriculture, of, the, mumun, pottery, period, about, 1500, 300, bce, in, korea, millets, and, their, wild, ancestors, such, as, barnyard, grass, and, panic, grass, were, also, cultivated, in, japan, during, the, j, mon, period, sometime, after, 4000, bce, chinese, myths, attribute, the, domestication, of, millet, to, shennong, a, legendary, emperor, of, china, and, hou, ji, whose, name, means, lord, millet, little, millet, panicum, sumatrense, is, believed, to, have, been, domesticated, around, 5000, bce, in, indian, subcontinent, and, kodo, millet, paspalum, scrobiculatum, around, 3700, bce, also, in, indian, subcontinent, various, millets, have, been, mentioned, in, some, of, the, yajurveda, texts, identifying, foxtail, millet, priya, gu, barnyard, millet, a, u, and, black, finger, millet, y, m, ka, indicating, that, millet, cultivation, was, happening, around, 1200, bce, in, india, upon, request, by, the, indian, government, in, 2018, the, food, and, agriculture, organisation, of, the, united, nations, fao, declared, 2023, as, international, year, of, millets, pearl, millet, pennisetum, glaucum, was, domesticated, in, the, sahel, region, of, west, africa, from, pennisetum, violaceum, early, archaeological, evidence, in, africa, includes, finds, at, birimi, in, northern, ghana, 1740, cal, bc, and, dhar, tichitt, in, mauritania, 1936, 1683, cal, bc, and, the, lower, tilemsi, valley, in, mali, 2500, to, 2000, cal, bc, studies, of, isozymes, suggest, domestication, took, place, north, east, of, the, senegal, river, in, the, far, west, of, the, sahel, and, tentatively, around, 6000, bc, pearl, millet, had, arrived, in, the, indian, subcontinent, by, 2000, bc, to, 1700, bc, finger, millet, is, originally, native, to, the, highlands, of, east, africa, and, was, domesticated, before, the, third, millennium, bce, its, cultivation, had, spread, to, south, india, by, 1800, bce, research, on, millets, is, carried, out, by, the, international, crops, research, institute, for, the, semi, arid, tropics, icrisat, and, icar, indian, institute, of, millets, research, in, telangana, india, and, by, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, s, agricultural, research, service, at, tifton, georgia, united, states, pearl, millet, is, one, of, the, two, major, crops, in, the, semiarid, impoverished, less, fertile, agriculture, regions, of, africa, and, southeast, asia, millets, are, not, only, adapted, to, poor, dry, infertile, soils, but, they, are, also, more, reliable, under, these, conditions, than, most, other, grain, crops, this, has, in, part, made, millet, production, popular, particularly, in, countries, surrounding, the, sahara, in, western, africa, millets, however, do, respond, to, high, fertility, and, moisture, on, a, per, hectare, basis, millet, grain, production, can, be, 2, to, 4, times, higher, with, use, of, irrigation, and, soil, supplements, improved, breeds, of, millet, with, enhanced, disease, resistance, can, significantly, increase, farm, yield, there, has, been, cooperation, between, poor, countries, to, improve, millet, yields, for, example, okashana, 1, a, variety, developed, in, india, from, a, natural, growing, millet, variety, in, burkina, faso, doubled, yields, this, breed, was, selected, for, trials, in, zimbabwe, from, there, it, was, taken, to, namibia, where, it, was, released, in, 1990, and, enthusiastically, adopted, by, farmers, okashana, 1, became, the, most, popular, variety, in, namibia, the, only, non, sahelian, country, where, pearl, millet, locally, known, as, mahangu, is, the, dominant, food, staple, for, consumers, okashana, 1, was, then, introduced, to, chad, the, breed, has, significantly, enhanced, yields, in, mauritania, and, benin, in, 2022, global, production, of, millet, was, 30, 9, million, tonnes, india, is, the, top, millet, producer, worldwide, with, 11, 8, million, tonnes, grown, annually, some, 38, of, the, world, total, and, nearly, triple, its, nearest, rival, eight, of, the, remaining, nine, nations, in, the, top, 10, producers, are, in, africa, ranging, from, niger, at, 3, 7, tonnes, to, chad, 0, 7, tonnes, the, sole, exception, is, china, number, three, in, global, production, at, 2, 7, tonnes, millets, are, major, food, sources, in, arid, and, semiarid, regions, of, the, world, and, feature, in, the, traditional, cuisine, of, many, others, in, western, india, sorghum, called, jowar, jola, dzonnalu, jwaarie, or, jondhahlaa, in, gujarati, kannada, telugu, hindi, and, marathi, languages, respectively, mutthaari, kora, or, panjappullu, in, malayalam, or, cholam, in, tamil, has, been, commonly, used, with, millet, flour, called, jowari, in, western, india, for, hundreds, of, years, to, make, the, local, staple, hand, rolled, that, is, made, without, a, rolling, pin, flat, bread, rotla, in, gujarati, bhakri, in, marathi, or, roti, in, other, languages, another, cereal, grain, popularly, used, in, rural, areas, and, by, poor, people, to, consume, as, a, staple, in, the, form, of, roti, other, millets, such, as, ragi, finger, millet, in, karnataka, naachanie, in, maharashtra, or, kezhvaragu, in, tamil, ragulu, in, telugu, with, the, popular, ragi, rotti, and, ragi, mudde, is, a, popular, meal, in, karnataka, ragi, as, it, is, popularly, known, is, dark, in, color, like, rye, but, rougher, in, texture, millet, porridge, is, a, traditional, food, in, russian, german, and, chinese, uisines, in, russia, it, is, eaten, sweet, with, milk, and, sugar, added, at, the, end, of, the, cooking, process, or, savoury, with, meat, or, vegetable, stews, in, china, it, is, eaten, without, milk, or, sugar, frequently, with, beans, sweet, potato, and, or, various, types, of, squash, in, germany, it, is, also, eaten, sweet, boiled, in, water, with, apples, added, during, the, boiling, process, and, honey, added, during, the, cooling, process, millet, is, the, main, ingredient, in, a, vietnamese, sweet, snack, called, b, nh, a, k, it, contains, a, layer, of, smashed, millet, and, mungbean, topped, with, sliced, dried, coconut, meat, wrapped, in, a, crunchy, rice, cake, in, parts, of, africa, it, is, mixed, with, milk, and, consumed, as, brukina, in, india, various, alcoholic, beverages, are, produced, from, millets, millet, is, also, the, base, ingredient, for, the, distilled, liquor, rakshi, in, addition, to, being, used, for, seed, millet, is, also, used, as, a, grazing, forage, crop, instead, of, letting, the, plant, reach, maturity, it, can, be, grazed, by, stock, and, is, commonly, used, for, sheep, and, cattle, millet, is, a, c4, plant, which, means, that, it, has, good, water, use, efficiency, and, utilizes, high, temperature, and, is, therefore, a, summer, crop, a, c4, plant, uses, a, different, enzyme, in, photosynthesis, from, c3, plants, and, this, is, why, it, improves, water, efficiency, in, southern, australia, millet, is, used, as, a, summer, quality, pasture, utilizing, warm, temperatures, and, summer, storms, millet, is, frost, sensitive, and, is, sown, after, the, frost, period, once, soil, temperature, has, stabilised, at, 14, c, or, higher, it, is, sown, at, a, shallow, depth, millet, grows, rapidly, and, can, be, grazed, 5, 7, weeks, after, sowing, when, it, is, 20, 30, cm, high, the, highest, feed, value, is, from, the, young, green, leaf, and, shoots, the, plant, can, quickly, come, to, head, so, it, must, be, managed, accordingly, because, as, the, plant, matures, the, value, and, palatability, of, feed, reduces, the, japanese, millets, echinochloa, esculenta, are, considered, the, best, for, grazing, and, in, particular, shirohie, a, new, variety, of, japanese, millet, is, the, best, suited, variety, for, grazing, this, is, due, to, a, number, of, factors, it, gives, better, regrowth, and, is, later, to, mature, compared, to, other, japanese, millets, it, is, cheap, cost, of, seed, is, 2, 3, per, kg, it, is, quick, to, establish, can, be, grazed, early, and, is, suitable, for, both, sheep, and, cattle, compared, to, forage, sorghum, which, is, grown, as, an, alternative, grazing, forage, animals, gain, weight, faster, on, millet, and, it, has, better, hay, or, silage, potential, although, it, produces, less, dry, matter, lambs, do, better, on, millet, compared, to, sorghum, millet, does, not, contain, prussic, acid, which, can, be, in, sorghum, prussic, acid, poisons, animals, by, inhibiting, oxygen, utilisation, by, the, cells, and, is, transported, in, the, blood, around, the, body, ultimately, the, animal, will, die, from, asphyxia, there, is, no, need, for, additional, feed, supplements, such, as, sulfur, or, salt, blocks, with, millet, the, rapid, growth, of, millet, as, a, grazing, crop, allows, flexibility, in, its, use, farmers, can, wait, until, sufficient, late, spring, summer, moisture, is, present, and, then, make, use, of, it, it, is, ideally, suited, to, irrigation, where, livestock, finishing, is, required, per, capita, consumption, of, millets, as, food, varies, in, different, parts, of, the, world, with, consumption, being, the, highest, in, western, africa, in, the, sahel, region, millet, is, estimated, to, account, for, about, 35, percent, of, total, cereal, food, consumption, in, burkina, faso, chad, and, the, gambia, in, mali, and, senegal, millets, constitute, roughly, 40, percent, of, total, cereal, food, consumption, per, capita, while, in, niger, and, arid, namibia, it, is, over, 65, percent, see, mahangu, other, countries, in, africa, where, millets, are, a, significant, food, source, include, ethiopia, nigeria, and, uganda, millet, is, also, an, important, food, item, for, the, population, living, in, the, drier, parts, of, many, other, countries, especially, in, eastern, and, central, africa, and, in, the, northern, coastal, countries, of, western, africa, in, developing, countries, outside, africa, millet, has, local, significance, as, a, food, in, parts, of, some, countries, such, as, china, india, burma, and, north, korea, people, affected, by, gluten, related, disorders, such, as, coeliac, disease, non, celiac, gluten, sensitivity, and, wheat, allergy, sufferers, who, need, a, gluten, free, diet, can, replace, gluten, containing, cereals, in, their, diets, with, millet, nevertheless, while, millet, does, not, contain, gluten, its, grains, and, flour, may, be, contaminated, with, gluten, containing, cereals, the, following, table, shows, the, nutrient, content, of, millet, compared, to, major, staple, foods, in, a, raw, form
