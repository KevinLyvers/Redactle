the, humpback, whale, megaptera, novaeangliae, is, a, species, of, baleen, whale, it, is, a, rorqual, a, member, of, the, family, balaenopteridae, and, is, the, only, species, in, the, genus, megaptera, adults, range, in, length, from, 14, 17, m, 46, 56, ft, and, weigh, up, to, 40, metric, tons, 44, short, tons, the, humpback, has, a, distinctive, body, shape, with, long, pectoral, fins, and, tubercles, on, its, head, it, is, known, for, breaching, and, other, distinctive, surface, behaviors, making, it, popular, with, whale, watchers, males, produce, a, complex, song, typically, lasting, 4, to, 33, minutes, found, in, oceans, and, seas, around, the, world, humpback, whales, typically, migrate, up, to, 16, 000, km, 9, 900, mi, each, year, they, feed, in, polar, waters, and, migrate, to, tropical, or, subtropical, waters, to, breed, and, give, birth, their, diet, consists, mostly, of, krill, and, small, fish, and, they, use, bubbles, to, catch, prey, they, are, promiscuous, breeders, with, both, sexes, having, multiple, partners, orcas, are, the, main, natural, predators, of, humpback, whales, like, other, large, whales, the, humpback, was, a, target, for, the, whaling, industry, humans, once, hunted, the, species, to, the, brink, of, extinction, its, population, fell, to, around, 5, 000, by, the, 1960s, numbers, have, partially, recovered, to, some, 135, 000, animals, worldwide, while, entanglement, in, fishing, gear, collisions, with, ships, and, noise, pollution, continue, to, affect, the, species, the, humpback, was, first, identified, as, baleine, de, la, nouvelle, angleterre, by, mathurin, jacques, brisson, in, his, regnum, animale, of, 1756, in, 1781, georg, heinrich, borowski, described, the, species, converting, brisson, s, name, to, its, latin, equivalent, balaena, novaeangliae, in, 1804, bernard, germain, de, lac, p, de, shifted, the, humpback, from, the, family, balaenidae, renaming, it, b, jubartes, in, 1846, john, edward, gray, created, the, genus, megaptera, classifying, the, humpback, as, megaptera, longipinna, but, in, 1932, remington, kellogg, reverted, the, species, names, to, use, borowski, s, novaeangliae, the, common, name, is, derived, from, the, curving, of, their, backs, when, diving, the, generic, name, megaptera, from, the, ancient, greek, mega, giant, and, ptera, wing, refer, to, their, large, front, flippers, the, specific, name, means, new, englander, and, was, probably, given, by, brisson, due, to, regular, sightings, of, humpbacks, off, the, coast, of, new, england, humpback, whales, are, rorquals, members, of, the, family, balaenopteridae, which, includes, the, blue, fin, bryde, s, sei, and, minke, whales, a, 2018, genomic, analysis, estimates, that, rorquals, diverged, from, other, baleen, whales, in, the, late, miocene, between, 10, 5, and, 7, 5, million, years, ago, the, humpback, and, fin, whale, were, found, to, be, sister, taxon, see, phylogenetic, tree, below, there, is, reference, to, a, humpback, blue, whale, hybrid, in, the, south, pacific, attributed, to, marine, biologist, michael, poole, b, acutorostrata, bonaerensis, minke, whale, species, complex, b, musculus, blue, whale, b, borealis, sei, whale, eschrichtius, robustus, gray, whale, b, physalus, fin, whale, megaptera, novaeangliae, humpback, whale, modern, humpback, whale, populations, originated, in, the, southern, hemisphere, around, 880, 000, years, ago, and, colonized, the, northern, hemisphere, 200, 000, 50, 000, years, ago, a, 2014, genetic, study, suggested, that, the, separate, populations, in, the, north, atlantic, north, pacific, and, southern, oceans, have, had, limited, gene, flow, and, are, distinct, enough, to, be, subspecies, with, the, scientific, names, of, m, n, novaeangliae, m, n, kuzira, and, m, n, australis, respectively, a, non, migratory, population, in, the, arabian, sea, has, been, isolated, for, 70, 000, years, the, adult, humpback, whale, is, generally, 14, 15, m, 46, 49, ft, though, longer, lengths, of, 16, 17, m, 52, 56, ft, have, been, recorded, females, are, usually, 1, 1, 5, m, 3, ft, 3, in, 4, ft, 11, in, longer, than, males, the, species, can, reach, body, masses, of, 40, metric, tons, 44, short, tons, calves, are, born, at, around, 4, 3, m, 14, ft, long, with, a, weight, of, 680, kg, 1, 500, lb, the, body, is, bulky, with, a, thin, rostrum, and, proportionally, long, flippers, each, around, one, third, of, its, body, length, it, has, a, short, dorsal, fin, that, varies, from, nearly, non, existent, to, somewhat, long, and, curved, as, a, rorqual, the, humpback, has, grooves, between, the, tip, of, the, lower, jaw, and, the, navel, they, are, relatively, few, in, number, in, this, species, ranging, from, 14, to, 35, the, mouth, is, lined, with, baleen, plates, which, number, 270, 400, for, both, sides, the, dorsal, or, upper, side, of, the, animal, is, generally, black, the, ventral, or, underside, has, various, levels, of, black, and, white, coloration, whales, in, the, southern, hemisphere, tend, to, have, more, white, pigmentation, the, flippers, can, vary, from, all, white, to, white, only, on, the, undersurface, the, varying, color, patterns, and, scars, on, the, tail, flukes, distinguish, individual, animals, the, end, of, the, genital, slit, of, the, female, is, marked, by, a, round, feature, known, as, the, hemispherical, lobe, which, visually, distinguishes, males, and, females, unique, among, large, whales, humpbacks, have, bumps, or, tubercles, on, the, head, and, front, edge, of, the, flippers, the, tail, fluke, has, a, jagged, trailing, edge, the, tubercles, on, the, head, are, 5, 10, cm, 2, 0, 3, 9, in, thick, at, the, base, and, poke, up, to, 6, 5, cm, 2, 6, in, they, are, mostly, hollow, in, the, center, often, containing, at, least, one, fragile, hair, that, erupts, 1, 3, cm, 0, 39, 1, 18, in, from, the, skin, and, is, 0, 1, mm, 0, 0039, in, thick, the, tubercles, develop, early, in, the, womb, and, may, have, a, sensory, function, as, they, are, rich, in, nerves, humpback, whale, groups, aside, from, mothers, and, calves, typically, last, for, days, or, weeks, at, the, most, they, are, normally, sighted, in, small, groups, though, large, aggregations, form, during, feeding, and, among, males, competing, for, females, humpbacks, may, interact, with, other, cetacean, species, such, as, right, whales, fin, whales, and, bottlenose, dolphins, humpbacks, are, highly, active, at, the, surface, performing, aerial, behaviors, such, as, breaching, and, surface, slapping, with, the, tail, lobtailing, and, flippers, these, may, be, forms, of, play, and, communication, and, or, for, removing, parasites, humpbacks, rest, at, the, surface, with, their, bodies, lying, horizontally, the, species, is, a, slower, swimmer, than, other, rorquals, cruising, at, 7, 9, 15, 1, km, h, 4, 9, 9, 4, mph, when, threatened, a, humpback, may, speed, up, to, 27, km, h, 17, mph, they, frequent, shallow, seamounts, commonly, exploring, depths, of, up, to, 80, meters, 260, feet, and, occasionally, venturing, into, deep, dives, reaching, up, to, 616, meters, 2, 020, feet, these, deeper, descents, are, believed, to, serve, various, purposes, including, navigational, guidance, communication, with, fellow, humpback, whales, and, facilitation, of, feeding, activities, dives, typically, do, not, exceed, five, minutes, during, the, summer, but, are, normally, 15, 20, minutes, during, the, winter, as, it, dives, a, humpback, typically, raises, its, tail, fluke, exposing, the, underside, humpback, whales, feed, from, spring, to, fall, they, are, generalist, feeders, their, main, food, items, being, krill, copepods, other, plankton, and, small, schooling, fish, the, most, common, krill, species, eaten, in, the, southern, hemisphere, is, the, antarctic, krill, further, north, the, northern, krill, and, various, species, of, euphausia, and, thysanoessa, are, consumed, fish, prey, include, herring, capelin, sand, lances, and, atlantic, mackerel, like, other, rorquals, humpbacks, are, gulp, feeders, swallowing, prey, in, bulk, while, right, whales, and, bowhead, whales, are, skimmers, the, whale, increases, its, mouth, gape, by, expanding, the, grooves, water, is, pushed, out, through, the, baleen, in, the, southern, hemisphere, humpbacks, have, been, recorded, foraging, in, large, compact, gatherings, numbering, up, to, 200, individuals, humpbacks, hunt, their, prey, with, bubble, nets, a, group, swims, in, a, shrinking, circle, while, blowing, air, from, their, blowholes, capturing, the, prey, above, them, in, a, cylinder, of, bubbles, they, may, dive, up, to, 20, m, 70, ft, performing, this, technique, bubble, netting, comes, in, two, main, forms, upward, spirals, and, double, loops, upward, spirals, involve, the, whales, blowing, air, from, their, blowhole, continuously, as, they, circle, towards, the, surface, creating, a, spiral, of, bubbles, double, loops, consist, of, a, deep, long, loop, of, bubbles, that, herds, the, prey, followed, by, slapping, the, surface, and, then, a, smaller, loop, that, prepares, the, final, capture, combinations, of, spiraling, and, looping, have, been, recorded, after, the, humpbacks, create, the, nets, the, whales, swim, into, them, with, their, mouths, gaping, and, ready, to, swallow, using, network, based, diffusion, analysis, one, study, argued, that, whales, learned, lobtailing, from, other, whales, in, the, group, over, 27, years, in, response, to, a, change, in, primary, prey, the, tubercles, on, the, flippers, stall, the, angle, of, attack, which, both, maximizes, lift, and, minimizes, drag, see, tubercle, effect, this, along, with, the, shape, of, the, flippers, allows, the, whales, to, make, the, abrupt, turns, necessary, during, bubble, feeding, mating, and, breeding, take, place, during, the, winter, months, which, is, when, females, reach, estrus, and, males, reach, peak, testosterone, and, sperm, levels, humpback, whales, are, promiscuous, with, both, sexes, having, multiple, partners, males, will, frequently, trail, both, lone, females, and, cow, calf, pairs, these, are, known, as, escorts, and, the, male, that, is, closest, to, the, female, is, known, as, the, principal, escort, who, fights, off, the, other, suitors, known, as, challengers, other, males, called, secondary, escorts, trail, further, behind, and, are, not, directly, involved, in, the, conflict, agonistic, behavior, between, males, consists, of, tail, slashing, ramming, and, head, butting, males, have, also, been, observed, engaging, in, copulation, with, each, other, gestation, in, the, species, lasts, 11, 5, months, and, females, reproduce, every, 2, years, humpback, whale, births, have, been, rarely, observed, one, birth, witnessed, off, madagascar, occurred, within, four, minutes, mothers, typically, give, birth, in, mid, winter, usually, to, a, single, calf, calves, suckle, for, up, to, a, year, but, can, eat, adult, food, in, six, months, humpbacks, are, sexually, mature, at, 5, 10, years, depending, on, the, population, humpback, whales, possibly, live, over, 50, years, male, humpback, whales, produce, complex, songs, during, the, winter, breeding, season, these, vocals, range, in, frequency, between, 100, hz, and, 4, khz, with, harmonics, reaching, up, to, 24, khz, or, more, and, can, travel, at, least, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, males, may, sing, for, between, 4, and, 33, minutes, depending, on, the, region, in, hawaii, humpback, whales, have, been, recorded, vocalizing, for, as, long, as, 7, hours, songs, are, divided, into, layers, subunits, units, subphrases, phrases, and, themes, a, subunit, refers, to, the, discontinuities, or, inflections, of, a, sound, while, full, units, are, individual, sounds, similar, to, musical, notes, a, succession, of, units, creates, a, subphrase, and, a, collection, of, subphrases, make, up, a, phrase, similar, sounding, phrases, are, repeated, in, a, series, grouped, into, themes, and, multiple, themes, create, a, song, the, function, of, these, songs, has, been, debated, but, they, may, have, multiple, purposes, there, is, little, evidence, to, suggest, that, songs, establish, dominance, among, males, however, there, have, been, observations, of, non, singing, males, disrupting, singers, possibly, in, aggression, those, who, join, singers, are, males, who, were, not, previously, singing, females, do, not, appear, to, approach, singers, that, are, alone, but, may, be, drawn, to, gatherings, of, singing, males, much, like, a, lek, mating, system, another, possibility, is, that, songs, bring, in, foreign, whales, to, populate, the, breeding, grounds, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, humpback, whale, songs, have, echolocating, properties, and, may, serve, to, locate, other, whales, a, 2023, study, found, that, as, humpback, whales, numbers, have, recovered, from, whaling, singing, has, become, less, common, whale, songs, are, similar, among, males, in, a, specific, area, males, may, alter, their, songs, over, time, and, others, in, contact, with, them, copy, these, changes, they, have, been, shown, in, some, cases, to, spread, horizontally, between, neighboring, populations, throughout, successive, breeding, seasons, in, the, northern, hemisphere, songs, change, more, gradually, while, southern, hemisphere, songs, go, through, cyclical, revolutions, humpback, whales, are, reported, to, make, other, vocalizations, snorts, are, quick, low, frequency, sounds, commonly, heard, among, animals, in, groups, consisting, of, a, mother, calf, pair, and, one, or, more, male, escort, groups, these, likely, function, in, mediating, interactions, within, these, groups, grumbles, are, also, low, in, frequency, but, last, longer, and, are, more, often, made, by, groups, with, one, or, more, adult, males, they, appear, to, signal, body, size, and, may, serve, to, establish, social, status, thwops, and, wops, are, frequency, modulated, vocals, and, may, serve, as, contact, calls, both, within, and, between, groups, high, pitched, cries, and, violins, and, modulated, shrieks, are, normally, heard, in, groups, with, two, or, more, males, and, are, associated, with, competition, humpback, whales, produce, short, low, frequency, grunts, and, short, modulated, barks, when, joining, new, groups, visible, scars, indicate, that, orcas, prey, upon, juvenile, humpbacks, a, 2014, study, in, western, australia, observed, that, when, available, in, large, numbers, young, humpbacks, can, be, attacked, and, sometimes, killed, by, orcas, moreover, mothers, and, possibly, related, adults, escort, calves, to, deter, such, predation, the, suggestion, is, that, when, humpbacks, suffered, near, extinction, during, the, whaling, era, orcas, turned, to, other, prey, but, are, now, resuming, their, former, practice, there, is, also, evidence, that, humpback, whales, will, defend, against, or, mob, killer, whales, who, are, attacking, either, humpback, calves, or, juveniles, as, well, as, members, of, other, species, including, seals, the, humpback, s, protection, of, other, species, may, be, unintentional, a, spillover, of, mobbing, behavior, intended, to, protect, members, of, its, species, the, powerful, flippers, of, humpback, whales, often, infested, with, large, sharp, barnacles, are, formidable, weapons, against, orcas, when, threatened, they, will, thresh, their, flippers, and, tails, keeping, the, orcas, at, bay, the, great, white, shark, is, another, confirmed, predator, of, the, humpback, whale, in, 2020, marine, biologists, dines, and, gennari, et, al, published, a, documented, incident, of, a, group, of, great, white, sharks, exhibiting, pack, like, behavior, to, attack, and, kill, a, live, adult, humpback, whale, a, second, incident, regarding, great, white, sharks, killing, humpback, whales, was, documented, off, the, coast, of, south, africa, the, shark, recorded, instigating, the, attack, was, a, female, nicknamed, helen, working, alone, the, shark, attacked, a, 33, ft, 10, m, emaciated, and, entangled, humpback, whale, by, attacking, the, whale, s, tail, to, cripple, and, bleed, the, whale, before, she, managed, to, drown, the, whale, by, biting, onto, its, head, and, pulling, it, underwater, humpback, whales, are, found, in, marine, waters, worldwide, except, for, some, areas, at, the, equator, and, high, arctic, and, some, enclosed, seas, the, furthest, north, they, have, been, recorded, is, at, 81, n, around, northern, franz, josef, land, they, are, usually, coastal, and, tend, to, congregate, in, waters, within, continental, shelves, their, winter, breeding, grounds, are, located, around, the, equator, their, summer, feeding, areas, are, found, in, colder, waters, including, near, the, polar, ice, caps, humpbacks, go, on, vast, migrations, between, their, feeding, and, breeding, areas, often, crossing, the, open, ocean, the, species, has, been, recorded, traveling, up, to, 8, 000, km, 5, 000, mi, in, one, direction, an, isolated, non, migratory, population, feeds, and, breeds, in, the, northern, indian, ocean, mainly, in, the, arabian, sea, around, oman, this, population, has, also, been, recorded, in, the, gulf, of, aden, the, persian, gulf, and, off, the, coasts, of, pakistan, and, india, in, the, north, atlantic, there, are, two, separate, wintering, populations, one, in, the, west, indies, from, cuba, to, northern, venezuela, and, the, other, in, the, cape, verde, islands, and, northwest, africa, during, summer, west, indies, humpbacks, congregate, off, new, england, eastern, canada, and, western, greenland, while, the, cape, verde, population, gathers, around, iceland, and, norway, there, is, some, overlap, in, the, summer, ranges, of, these, populations, and, west, indies, humpbacks, have, been, documented, feeding, further, east, whale, visits, into, the, gulf, of, mexico, have, been, infrequent, but, have, occurred, in, the, gulf, historically, they, were, considered, to, be, uncommon, in, the, mediterranean, sea, but, increased, sightings, including, re, sightings, indicate, that, more, whales, may, colonize, or, recolonize, it, in, the, future, the, north, pacific, has, at, least, four, breeding, populations, off, mexico, including, baja, california, and, the, revillagigedos, islands, central, america, the, hawaiian, islands, and, both, okinawa, and, the, philippines, the, mexican, population, forages, from, the, aleutian, islands, to, california, during, the, summer, central, american, humpbacks, are, found, only, off, oregon, and, california, in, contrast, hawaiian, humpbacks, have, a, wide, feeding, range, but, most, travel, to, southeast, alaska, and, northern, british, columbia, the, wintering, grounds, of, the, okinawa, philippines, population, are, mainly, around, the, russian, far, east, there, is, some, evidence, for, a, fifth, population, somewhere, in, the, northwestern, pacific, these, whales, are, recorded, to, feed, off, the, aleutians, with, a, breeding, area, somewhere, south, of, the, bonin, islands, in, the, southern, hemisphere, humpback, whales, are, divided, into, seven, breeding, stocks, some, of, which, are, further, divided, into, sub, structures, these, include, the, southeastern, pacific, stock, g, southwestern, atlantic, stock, a, southeastern, atlantic, stock, b, southwestern, indian, ocean, stock, c, southeastern, indian, ocean, stock, d, southwestern, pacific, stock, e, and, the, oceania, stock, stocks, e, f, stock, g, breeds, in, tropical, and, subtropical, waters, off, the, west, coast, of, central, and, south, america, and, forages, along, the, west, coast, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, the, south, orkney, islands, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, tierra, del, fuego, of, southern, chile, stock, a, winters, off, brazil, and, migrates, to, summer, grounds, around, south, georgia, and, the, south, sandwich, islands, some, stock, a, individuals, have, also, been, recorded, off, the, western, antarctic, peninsula, suggesting, an, increased, blurring, of, the, boundaries, between, the, feeding, areas, of, stocks, a, and, g, stock, b, breeds, on, the, west, coast, of, africa, and, is, further, divided, into, bl, and, b2, subpopulations, the, former, ranging, from, the, gulf, of, guinea, to, angola, and, the, latter, ranging, from, angola, to, western, south, africa, stock, b, whales, have, been, recorded, foraging, in, waters, to, the, southwest, of, the, continent, mainly, around, bouvet, island, comparison, of, songs, between, those, at, cape, lopez, and, abrolhos, archipelago, indicate, that, trans, atlantic, mixings, between, stock, a, and, stock, b, whales, occur, stock, c, whales, winter, around, southeastern, africa, and, surrounding, waters, this, stock, is, further, divided, into, c1, c2, c3, and, c4, subpopulations, c1, occurs, around, mozambique, and, eastern, south, africa, c2, around, the, comoro, islands, c3, off, the, southern, and, eastern, coast, of, madagascar, and, c4, around, the, mascarene, islands, the, feeding, range, of, this, population, is, likely, between, coordinates, 5, w, and, 60, e, and, under, 50, s, there, may, be, overlap, in, the, feeding, areas, of, stocks, b, and, c, stock, d, whales, breed, off, the, western, coast, of, australia, and, forage, in, the, southern, region, of, the, kerguelen, plateau, stock, e, is, divided, into, e1, e2, and, e3, stocks, e1, whales, have, a, breeding, range, off, eastern, australia, and, tasmania, their, main, feeding, range, is, close, to, antarctica, mainly, within, 130, e, and, 170, w, the, oceania, stock, is, divided, into, the, new, caledonia, e2, tonga, e3, cook, islands, f1, and, french, polynesia, f2, subpopulations, this, stock, s, feeding, grounds, mainly, range, from, around, the, ross, sea, to, the, antarctic, peninsula, humpback, whales, were, hunted, as, early, as, the, late, 16th, century, they, were, often, the, first, species, to, be, harvested, in, an, area, due, to, this, coastal, distribution, north, pacific, kills, alone, are, estimated, at, 28, 000, during, the, 20th, century, in, the, same, period, over, 200, 000, humpbacks, were, taken, in, the, southern, hemisphere, north, atlantic, populations, dropped, to, as, low, as, 700, individuals, in, 1946, the, international, whaling, commission, iwc, was, founded, to, oversee, the, industry, they, imposed, hunting, regulations, and, created, hunting, seasons, to, prevent, extinction, iwc, banned, commercial, humpback, whaling, in, 1966, by, then, the, global, population, had, been, reduced, to, around, 5, 000, the, soviet, union, deliberately, under, recorded, its, catches, the, soviets, reported, catching, 2, 820, between, 1947, and, 1972, but, the, true, number, was, over, 48, 000, as, of, 2004, hunting, was, restricted, to, a, few, animals, each, year, off, the, caribbean, island, of, bequia, in, saint, vincent, and, the, grenadines, the, take, is, not, believed, to, threaten, the, local, population, japan, had, planned, to, kill, 50, humpbacks, in, the, 2007, 08, season, under, its, jarpa, ii, research, program, the, announcement, sparked, global, protests, after, a, visit, to, tokyo, by, the, iwc, chair, asking, the, japanese, for, their, co, operation, in, sorting, out, the, differences, between, pro, and, anti, whaling, nations, on, the, commission, the, japanese, whaling, fleet, agreed, to, take, no, humpback, whales, during, the, two, years, it, would, take, to, reach, a, formal, agreement, in, 2010, the, iwc, authorized, greenland, s, native, population, to, hunt, a, few, humpback, whales, for, the, following, three, years, much, of, the, growth, of, commercial, whale, watching, was, built, on, the, humpback, whale, the, species, highly, active, surface, behaviors, and, tendency, to, become, accustomed, to, boats, have, made, them, easy, to, observe, particularly, for, photographers, in, 1975, humpback, whale, tours, were, established, in, new, england, and, hawaii, this, business, brings, in, a, revenue, of, 20, million, per, year, for, hawaii, s, economy, while, hawaiian, tours, have, tended, to, be, commercial, new, england, and, california, whale, watching, tours, have, introduced, educational, components, as, of, 2018, the, iucn, red, list, lists, the, humpback, whale, as, least, concern, with, a, worldwide, population, of, around, 135, 000, whales, of, which, around, 84, 000, are, mature, individuals, and, an, increasing, population, trend, regional, estimates, are, around, 13, 000, in, the,
