amanita, phalloides, m, n, a, t, f, l, d, i, z, commonly, known, as, the, death, cap, is, a, deadly, poisonous, basidiomycete, fungus, one, of, many, in, the, genus, amanita, originating, in, europe, but, later, introduced, to, other, parts, of, the, world, since, the, late, twentieth, century, a, phalloides, forms, ectomycorrhizas, with, various, broadleaved, trees, in, some, cases, the, death, cap, has, been, introduced, to, new, regions, with, the, cultivation, of, non, native, species, of, oak, chestnut, and, pine, the, large, fruiting, bodies, mushrooms, appear, in, summer, and, autumn, the, caps, are, generally, greenish, in, colour, with, a, white, stipe, and, gills, the, cap, colour, is, variable, including, white, forms, and, is, thus, not, a, reliable, identifier, these, toxic, mushrooms, resemble, several, edible, species, most, notably, caesar, s, mushroom, and, the, straw, mushroom, commonly, consumed, by, humans, increasing, the, risk, of, accidental, poisoning, amatoxins, the, class, of, toxins, found, in, these, mushrooms, are, thermostable, they, resist, changes, due, to, heat, so, their, toxic, effects, are, not, reduced, by, cooking, amanita, phalloides, is, the, most, poisonous, of, all, known, mushrooms, it, is, estimated, that, as, little, as, half, a, mushroom, contains, enough, toxin, to, kill, an, adult, human, it, is, also, the, deadliest, mushroom, worldwide, responsible, for, 90, of, mushroom, related, fatalities, every, year, it, has, been, involved, in, the, majority, of, human, deaths, from, mushroom, poisoning, possibly, including, roman, emperor, claudius, in, ad, 54, and, holy, roman, emperor, charles, vi, in, 1740, it, has, also, been, the, subject, of, much, research, and, many, of, its, biologically, active, agents, have, been, isolated, the, principal, toxic, constituent, is, amanitin, which, causes, liver, and, kidney, failure, the, death, cap, is, named, in, latin, as, such, in, the, correspondence, between, the, english, physician, thomas, browne, and, christopher, merrett, also, it, was, described, by, french, botanist, s, bastien, vaillant, in, 1727, who, gave, a, succinct, phrase, name, fungus, phalloides, annulatus, sordide, virescens, et, patulus, a, recognizable, name, for, the, fungus, today, though, the, scientific, name, phalloides, means, phallus, shaped, it, is, unclear, whether, it, is, named, for, its, resemblance, to, a, literal, phallus, or, the, stinkhorn, mushrooms, phallus, in, 1821, elias, magnus, fries, described, it, as, agaricus, phalloides, but, included, all, white, amanitas, within, its, description, finally, in, 1833, johann, heinrich, friedrich, link, settled, on, the, name, amanita, phalloides, after, persoon, had, named, it, amanita, viridis, 30, years, earlier, although, louis, secretan, s, use, of, the, name, a, phalloides, predates, link, s, it, has, been, rejected, for, nomenclatural, purposes, because, secretan, s, works, did, not, use, binomial, nomenclature, consistently, some, taxonomists, have, however, disagreed, with, this, opinion, amanita, phalloides, is, the, type, species, of, amanita, section, phalloideae, a, group, that, contains, all, of, the, deadly, poisonous, amanita, species, thus, far, identified, most, notable, of, these, are, the, species, known, as, destroying, angels, namely, a, virosa, a, bisporigera, and, a, ocreata, as, well, as, the, fool, s, mushroom, a, verna, the, term, destroying, angel, has, been, applied, to, a, phalloides, at, times, but, death, cap, is, by, far, the, most, common, vernacular, name, used, in, english, other, common, names, also, listed, include, stinking, amanita, and, deadly, amanita, a, rarely, appearing, all, white, form, was, initially, described, a, phalloides, f, alba, by, max, britzelmayr, though, its, status, has, been, unclear, it, is, often, found, growing, amid, normally, colored, death, caps, it, has, been, described, in, 2004, as, a, distinct, variety, and, includes, what, was, termed, a, verna, var, tarda, the, true, a, verna, fruits, in, spring, and, turns, yellow, with, koh, solution, whereas, a, phalloides, never, does, the, death, cap, has, a, large, and, imposing, epigeous, aboveground, fruiting, body, basidiocarp, usually, with, a, pileus, cap, from, 5, to, 15, centimetres, 2, to, 5, 7, 8, inches, across, initially, rounded, and, hemispherical, but, flattening, with, age, the, color, of, the, cap, can, be, pale, green, yellowish, green, olive, green, bronze, or, in, one, form, white, it, is, often, paler, toward, the, margins, which, can, have, darker, streaks, it, is, also, often, paler, after, rain, the, cap, surface, is, sticky, when, wet, and, easily, peeled, a, troublesome, feature, as, that, is, allegedly, a, feature, of, edible, fungi, the, remains, of, the, partial, veil, are, seen, as, a, skirtlike, floppy, annulus, usually, about, 1, to, 1, 5, cm, 3, 8, to, 5, 8, in, below, the, cap, the, crowded, white, lamellae, gills, are, free, the, stipe, is, white, with, a, scattering, of, grayish, olive, scales, and, is, 8, to, 15, cm, 3, 1, 8, to, 5, 7, 8, in, long, and, 1, to, 2, cm, 3, 8, to, 3, 4, in, thick, with, a, swollen, ragged, sac, like, white, volva, base, as, the, volva, which, may, be, hidden, by, leaf, litter, is, a, distinctive, and, diagnostic, feature, it, is, important, to, remove, some, debris, to, check, for, it, spores, 7, 12, x, 6, 9, m, smooth, ellipsoid, amyloid, the, smell, has, been, described, as, initially, faint, and, honey, sweet, but, strengthening, over, time, to, become, overpowering, sickly, sweet, and, objectionable, young, specimens, first, emerge, from, the, ground, resembling, a, white, egg, covered, by, a, universal, veil, which, then, breaks, leaving, the, volva, as, a, remnant, the, spore, print, is, white, a, common, feature, of, amanita, the, transparent, spores, are, globular, to, egg, shaped, measure, 8, 10, m, 0, 3, 0, 4, mil, long, and, stain, blue, with, iodine, the, gills, in, contrast, stain, pallid, lilac, or, pink, with, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, the, species, is, now, known, to, contain, two, main, groups, of, toxins, both, multicyclic, ring, shaped, peptides, spread, throughout, the, mushroom, tissue, the, amatoxins, and, the, phallotoxins, another, toxin, is, phallolysin, which, has, shown, some, hemolytic, red, blood, cell, destroying, activity, in, vitro, an, unrelated, compound, antamanide, has, also, been, isolated, amatoxins, consist, of, at, least, eight, compounds, with, a, similar, structure, that, of, eight, amino, acid, rings, they, were, isolated, in, 1941, by, heinrich, o, wieland, and, rudolf, hallermayer, of, the, university, of, munich, of, the, amatoxins, amanitin, is, the, chief, component, and, along, with, amanitin, is, likely, responsible, for, the, toxic, effects, their, major, toxic, mechanism, is, the, inhibition, of, rna, polymerase, ii, a, vital, enzyme, in, the, synthesis, of, messenger, rna, mrna, microrna, and, small, nuclear, rna, snrna, without, mrna, essential, protein, synthesis, and, hence, cell, metabolism, grind, to, a, halt, and, the, cell, dies, the, liver, is, the, principal, organ, affected, as, it, is, the, organ, which, is, first, encountered, after, absorption, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, though, other, organs, especially, the, kidneys, are, susceptible, the, rna, polymerase, of, amanita, phalloides, is, insensitive, to, the, effects, of, amatoxins, so, the, mushroom, does, not, poison, itself, the, phallotoxins, consist, of, at, least, seven, compounds, all, of, which, have, seven, similar, peptide, rings, phalloidin, was, isolated, in, 1937, by, feodor, lynen, heinrich, wieland, s, student, and, son, in, law, and, ulrich, wieland, of, the, university, of, munich, though, phallotoxins, are, highly, toxic, to, liver, cells, they, have, since, been, found, to, add, little, to, the, death, cap, s, toxicity, as, they, are, not, absorbed, through, the, gut, furthermore, phalloidin, is, also, found, in, the, edible, and, sought, after, blusher, a, rubescens, another, group, of, minor, active, peptides, are, the, virotoxins, which, consist, of, six, similar, monocyclic, heptapeptides, like, the, phallotoxins, they, do, not, induce, any, acute, toxicity, after, ingestion, in, humans, the, genome, of, the, death, cap, has, been, sequenced, a, phalloides, is, similar, to, the, edible, paddy, straw, mushroom, volvariella, volvacea, and, a, princeps, commonly, known, as, white, caesar, some, may, mistake, juvenile, death, caps, for, edible, puffballs, or, mature, specimens, for, other, edible, amanita, species, such, as, a, lanei, so, some, authorities, recommend, avoiding, the, collecting, of, amanita, species, for, the, table, altogether, the, white, form, of, a, phalloides, may, be, mistaken, for, edible, species, of, agaricus, especially, the, young, fruitbodies, whose, unexpanded, caps, conceal, the, telltale, white, gills, all, mature, species, of, agaricus, have, dark, colored, gills, in, europe, other, similarly, green, capped, species, collected, by, mushroom, hunters, include, various, green, hued, brittlegills, of, the, genus, russula, and, the, formerly, popular, tricholoma, equestre, now, regarded, as, hazardous, owing, to, a, series, of, restaurant, poisonings, in, france, brittlegills, such, as, russula, heterophylla, r, aeruginea, and, r, virescens, can, be, distinguished, by, their, brittle, flesh, and, the, lack, of, both, volva, and, ring, other, similar, species, include, a, subjunquillea, in, eastern, asia, and, a, arocheae, which, ranges, from, andean, colombia, north, at, least, as, far, as, central, mexico, both, of, which, are, also, poisonous, the, death, cap, is, native, to, europe, where, it, is, widespread, it, is, found, from, the, southern, coastal, regions, of, scandinavia, in, the, north, to, ireland, in, the, west, east, to, poland, and, western, russia, and, south, throughout, the, balkans, in, greece, italy, spain, and, portugal, in, the, mediterranean, basin, and, in, morocco, and, algeria, in, north, africa, in, west, asia, it, has, been, reported, from, forests, of, northern, iran, there, are, records, from, further, east, in, asia, but, these, have, yet, to, be, confirmed, as, a, phalloides, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, charles, horton, peck, had, reported, a, phalloides, in, north, america, in, 1918, samples, from, the, eastern, united, states, were, identified, as, being, a, distinct, though, similar, species, a, brunnescens, by, george, francis, atkinson, of, cornell, university, by, the, 1970s, it, had, become, clear, that, a, phalloides, does, occur, in, the, united, states, apparently, having, been, introduced, from, europe, alongside, chestnuts, with, populations, on, the, west, and, east, coasts, a, 2006, historical, review, concluded, the, east, coast, populations, were, inadvertently, introduced, likely, on, the, roots, of, other, purposely, imported, plants, such, as, chestnuts, the, origins, of, the, west, coast, populations, remained, unclear, due, to, scant, historical, records, but, a, 2009, genetic, study, provided, strong, evidence, for, the, introduced, status, of, the, fungus, on, the, west, coast, of, north, america, observations, of, various, collections, of, a, phalloides, from, conifers, rather, than, native, forests, have, led, to, the, hypothesis, that, the, species, was, introduced, to, north, america, multiple, times, it, is, hypothesized, that, the, various, introductions, led, to, multiple, genotypes, which, are, adapted, to, either, oaks, or, conifers, a, phalloides, were, conveyed, to, new, countries, across, the, southern, hemisphere, with, the, importation, of, hardwoods, and, conifers, in, the, late, twentieth, century, introduced, oaks, appear, to, have, been, the, vector, to, australia, and, south, america, populations, under, oaks, have, been, recorded, from, melbourne, and, canberra, where, two, people, died, in, january, 2012, of, four, who, were, poisoned, and, adelaide, as, well, as, uruguay, it, has, been, recorded, under, other, introduced, trees, in, argentina, pine, plantations, are, associated, with, the, fungus, in, tanzania, and, south, africa, and, it, is, also, found, under, oaks, and, poplars, in, chile, a, number, of, deaths, in, india, have, been, attributed, to, it, it, is, ectomycorrhizally, associated, with, several, tree, species, and, is, symbiotic, with, them, in, europe, these, include, hardwood, and, less, frequently, conifer, species, it, appears, most, commonly, under, oaks, but, also, under, beeches, chestnuts, horse, chestnuts, birches, filberts, hornbeams, pines, and, spruces, in, other, areas, a, phalloides, may, also, be, associated, with, these, trees, or, with, only, some, species, and, not, others, in, coastal, california, for, example, a, phalloides, is, associated, with, coast, live, oak, but, not, with, the, various, coastal, pine, species, such, as, monterey, pine, in, countries, where, it, has, been, introduced, it, has, been, restricted, to, those, exotic, trees, with, which, it, would, associate, in, its, natural, range, there, is, however, evidence, of, a, phalloides, associating, with, hemlock, and, with, genera, of, the, myrtaceae, eucalyptus, in, tanzania, and, algeria, and, leptospermum, and, kunzea, in, new, zealand, suggesting, that, the, species, may, have, invasive, potential, it, may, have, also, been, anthropogenically, introduced, to, the, island, of, cyprus, where, it, has, been, documented, to, fruit, within, corylus, avellana, plantations, as, the, common, name, suggests, the, fungus, is, highly, toxic, and, is, responsible, for, the, majority, of, fatal, mushroom, poisonings, worldwide, its, biochemistry, has, been, researched, intensively, for, decades, and, 30, grams, 1, 1, ounces, or, half, a, cap, of, this, mushroom, is, estimated, to, be, enough, to, kill, a, human, on, average, one, person, dies, a, year, in, north, america, from, death, cap, ingestion, the, toxins, of, the, death, cap, mushrooms, primarily, target, the, liver, but, other, organs, such, as, the, kidneys, are, also, affected, symptoms, of, death, cap, mushroom, toxicity, usually, occur, 6, to, 12, hours, after, ingestion, symptoms, of, ingestion, of, the, death, cap, mushroom, may, include, nausea, and, vomiting, which, is, then, followed, by, jaundice, seizures, and, coma, which, will, lead, to, death, the, mortality, rate, of, ingestion, of, the, death, cap, mushroom, is, believed, to, be, around, 10, 30, some, authorities, strongly, advise, against, putting, suspected, death, caps, in, the, same, basket, with, fungi, collected, for, the, table, and, to, avoid, even, touching, them, furthermore, the, toxicity, is, not, reduced, by, cooking, freezing, or, drying, poisoning, incidents, usually, result, from, errors, in, identification, recent, cases, highlight, the, issue, of, the, similarity, of, a, phalloides, to, the, edible, paddy, straw, mushroom, volvariella, volvacea, with, east, and, southeast, asian, immigrants, in, australia, and, the, west, coast, of, the, u, s, falling, victim, in, an, episode, in, oregon, four, members, of, a, korean, family, required, liver, transplants, many, north, american, incidents, of, death, cap, poisoning, have, occurred, among, laotian, and, hmong, immigrants, since, it, is, easily, confused, with, a, princeps, white, caesar, a, popular, mushroom, in, their, native, countries, of, the, 9, people, poisoned, in, australia, s, canberra, region, between, 1988, and, 2011, three, were, from, laos, and, two, were, from, china, in, january, 2012, four, people, were, accidentally, poisoned, when, death, caps, reportedly, misidentified, as, straw, mushrooms, which, are, popular, in, chinese, and, other, asian, dishes, were, served, for, dinner, in, canberra, all, the, victims, required, hospital, treatment, and, two, of, them, died, with, a, third, requiring, a, liver, transplant, death, caps, have, been, reported, to, taste, pleasant, this, coupled, with, the, delay, in, the, appearance, of, symptoms, during, which, time, internal, organs, are, being, severely, sometimes, irreparably, damaged, makes, them, particularly, dangerous, initially, symptoms, are, gastrointestinal, in, nature, and, include, colicky, abdominal, pain, with, watery, diarrhea, nausea, and, vomiting, which, may, lead, to, dehydration, if, left, untreated, and, in, severe, cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and, acid, base, disturbances, these, first, symptoms, resolve, two, to, three, days, after, the, ingestion, a, more, serious, deterioration, signifying, liver, involvement, may, then, occur, jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and, coma, due, to, fulminant, liver, failure, and, attendant, hepatic, encephalopathy, caused, by, the, accumulation, of, normally, liver, removed, substances, in, the, blood, kidney, failure, either, secondary, to, severe, hepatitis, or, caused, by, direct, toxic, kidney, damage, and, coagulopathy, may, appear, during, this, stage, life, threatening, complications, include, increased, intracranial, pressure, intracranial, bleeding, pancreatic, inflammation, acute, kidney, failure, and, cardiac, arrest, death, generally, occurs, six, to, sixteen, days, after, the, poisoning, it, is, noticed, that, after, up, to, 24, hours, have, passed, the, symptoms, seem, to, disappear, and, the, person, might, feel, fine, for, up, to, 72, hours, symptoms, of, liver, and, kidney, damage, start, 3, to, 6, days, after, the, mushrooms, were, eaten, with, the, considerable, increase, of, the, transaminases, mushroom, poisoning, is, more, common, in, europe, than, in, north, america, up, to, the, mid, 20th, century, the, mortality, rate, was, around, 60, 70, but, this, has, been, greatly, reduced, with, advances, in, medical, care, a, review, of, death, cap, poisoning, throughout, europe, from, 1971, to, 1980, found, the, overall, mortality, rate, to, be, 22, 4, 51, 3, in, children, under, ten, and, 16, 5, in, those, older, than, ten, this, was, revised, to, around, 10, 15, in, surveys, reviewed, in, 1995, consumption, of, the, death, cap, is, a, medical, emergency, requiring, hospitalization, the, four, main, categories, of, therapy, for, poisoning, are, preliminary, medical, care, supportive, measures, specific, treatments, and, liver, transplantation, preliminary, care, consists, of, gastric, decontamination, with, either, activated, carbon, or, gastric, lavage, due, to, the, delay, between, ingestion, and, the, first, symptoms, of, poisoning, it, is, common, for, patients, to, arrive, for, treatment, many, hours, after, ingestion, potentially, reducing, the, efficacy, of, these, interventions, supportive, measures, are, directed, towards, treating, the, dehydration, which, results, from, fluid, loss, during, the, gastrointestinal, phase, of, intoxication, and, correction, of, metabolic, acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte, imbalances, and, impaired, coagulation, no, definitive, antidote, is, available, but, some, specific, treatments, have, been, shown, to, improve, survivability, high, dose, continuous, intravenous, penicillin, g, has, been, reported, to, be, of, benefit, though, the, exact, mechanism, is, unknown, and, trials, with, cephalosporins, show, promise, some, evidence, indicates, intravenous, silibinin, an, extract, from, the, blessed, milk, thistle, silybum, marianum, may, be, beneficial, in, reducing, the, effects, of, death, cap, poisoning, a, long, term, clinical, trial, of, intravenous, silibinin, began, in, the, us, in, 2010, silibinin, prevents, the, uptake, of, amatoxins, by, liver, cells, thereby, protecting, undamaged, liver, tissue, it, also, stimulates, dna, dependent, rna, polymerases, leading, to, an, increase, in, rna, synthesis, according, to, one, report, based, on, a, treatment, of, 60, patients, with, silibinin, patients, who, started, the, drug, within, 96, hours, of, ingesting, the, mushroom, and, who, still, had, intact, kidney, function, all, survived, as, of, february, 2014, supporting, research, has, not, yet, been, published, slco1b3, has, been, identified, as, the, human, hepatic, uptake, transporter, for, amatoxins, moreover, substrates, and, inhibitors, of, that, protein, among, others, rifampicin, penicillin, silibinin, antamanide, paclitaxel, ciclosporin, and, prednisolone, may, be, useful, for, the, treatment, of, human, amatoxin, poisoning, n, acetylcysteine, has, shown, promise, in, combination, with, other, therapies, animal, studies, indicate, the, amatoxins, deplete, hepatic, glutathione, n, acetylcysteine, serves, as, a, glutathione, precursor, and, may, therefore, prevent, reduced, glutathione, levels, and, subsequent, liver, damage, none, of, the, antidotes, used, have, undergone, prospective, randomized, clinical, trials, and, only, anecdotal, support, is, available, silibinin, and, n, acetylcysteine, appear, to, be, the, therapies, with, the, most, potential, benefit, repeated, doses, of, activated, carbon, may, be, helpful, by, absorbing, any, toxins, returned, to, the, gastrointestinal, tract, following, enterohepatic, circulation, other, methods, of, enhancing, the, elimination, of, the, toxins, have, been, trialed, techniques, such, as, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and, peritoneal, dialysis, have, occasionally, yielded, success, but, overall, do, not, appear, to, improve, outcome, in, patients, developing, liver, failure, a, liver, transplant, is, often, the, only, option, to, prevent, death, liver, transplants, have, become, a, well, established, option, in, amatoxin, poisoning, this, is, a, complicated, issue, however, as, transplants, themselves, may, have, significant, complications, and, mortality, patients, require, long, term, immunosuppression, to, maintain, the, transplant, that, being, the, case, the, criteria, have, been, reassessed, such, as, onset, of, symptoms, prothrombin, time, pt, serum, bilirubin, and, presence, of, encephalopathy, for, determining, at, what, point, a, transplant, becomes, necessary, for, survival, evidence, suggests, although, survival, rates, have, improved, with, modern, medical, treatment, in, patients, with, moderate, to, severe, poisoning, up, to, half, of, those, who, did, recover, suffered, permanent, liver, damage, a, follow, up, study, has, shown, most, survivors, recover, completely, without, any, sequelae, if, treated, within, 36, hours, of, mushroom, ingestion, ce, plat, de, champignons, a, chang, la, destin, e, de, l, europe, several, historical, figures, may, have, died, from, a, phalloides, poisoning, or, other, similar, toxic, amanita, species, these, were, either, accidental, poisonings, or, assassination, plots, alleged, victims, of, this, kind, of, poisoning, include, roman, emperor, claudius, pope, clement, vii, the, russian, tsaritsa, natalia, naryshkina, and, holy, roman, emperor, charles, vi, r, gordon, wasson, recounted, the, details, of, these, deaths, noting, the, likelihood, of, amanita, poisoning, in, the, case, of, clement, vii, the, illness, that, led, to, his, death, lasted, five, months, making, the, case, inconsistent, with, amatoxin, poisoning, natalya, naryshkina, is, said, to, have, consumed, a, large, quantity, of, pickled, mushrooms, prior, to, her, death, it, is, unclear, whether, the, mushrooms, themselves, were, poisonous, or, if, she, succumbed, to, food, poisoning, charles, vi, experienced, indigestion, after, eating, a, dish, of, saut, ed, mushrooms, this, led, to, an, illness, from, which, he, died, 10, days, later, symptomatology, consistent, with, amatoxin, poisoning, his, death, led, to, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, noted, voltaire, this, mushroom, dish, has, changed, the, destiny, of, europe, the, case, of, claudius, s, poisoning, is, more, complex, claudius, was, known, to, have, been, very, fond, of, eating, caesar, s, mushroom, following, his, death, many, sources, have, attributed, it, to, his, being, fed, a, meal, of, death, caps, instead, of, caesar, s, mushrooms, ancient, authors, such, as, tacitus, and, suetonius, are, unanimous, about, poison, having, been, added, to, the, mushroom, dish, rather, than, the, dish, having, been, prepared, from, poisonous, mushrooms, wasson, speculated, the, poison, used, to, kill, claudius, was, derived, from, death, caps, with, a, fatal, dose, of, an, unknown, poison, possibly, a, variety, of, nightshade, being, administered, later, during, his, illness, other, historians, have, speculated, that, claudius, may, have, died, of, natural, causes, in, july, 2023, four, people, in, leongatha, australia, were, taken, to, hospital, after, consuming, a, beef, wellington, suspected, to, have, contained, a, phalloides, three, of, the, four, guests, subsequently, died, and, one, survived, later, receiving, a, liver, transplant, the, woman, who, cooked, the, meal, erin, patterson, was, charged, with, murder, in, november, 2023
