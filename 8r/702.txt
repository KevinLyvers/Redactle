the, budgerigar, b, d, r, r, r, i, buj, r, ih, gar, ree, melopsittacus, undulatus, also, known, as, the, common, parakeet, shell, parakeet, or, budgie, b, d, i, buj, ee, is, a, small, long, tailed, seed, eating, parrot, naturally, the, species, is, green, and, yellow, with, black, scalloped, markings, on, the, nape, back, and, wings, budgies, are, bred, in, captivity, with, colouring, of, blues, whites, yellows, greys, and, even, with, small, crests, juveniles, and, chicks, are, monomorphic, while, adults, are, told, apart, by, their, cere, colouring, and, their, behaviour, the, species, is, the, only, member, of, the, genus, melopsittacus, which, is, the, only, genus, in, the, melopsittacini, tribe, the, origin, of, the, budgerigar, s, name, is, unclear, first, recorded, in, 1805, budgerigars, are, popular, pets, around, the, world, due, to, their, small, size, low, cost, and, ability, to, mimic, human, speech, they, are, likely, the, third, most, popular, pet, in, the, world, after, the, domesticated, dog, and, cat, budgies, are, nomadic, flock, parakeets, that, have, been, bred, in, captivity, since, the, 19th, century, in, both, captivity, and, the, wild, budgerigars, breed, opportunistically, and, in, pairs, they, are, found, wild, throughout, the, drier, parts, of, australia, where, they, have, survived, harsh, inland, conditions, for, over, five, million, years, their, success, can, be, attributed, to, a, nomadic, lifestyle, and, their, ability, to, breed, while, on, the, move, the, budgerigar, is, closely, related, to, lories, and, the, fig, parrots, several, possible, origins, for, the, name, budgerigar, have, been, proposed, one, origin, could, be, that, budgerigar, may, be, a, mispronunciation, or, alteration, of, the, gamilaraay, word, gidjirrigaa, aboriginal, pronunciation, or, gijirragaa, from, the, yuwaalaraay, another, possible, origin, is, that, budgerigar, might, be, a, modified, form, of, budgery, or, boojery, australian, english, slang, for, good, and, gar, cockatoo, while, many, references, mention, good, as, part, of, the, meaning, and, a, few, specify, good, bird, it, is, quite, possible, that, reports, by, those, local, to, the, region, are, more, accurate, in, specifying, the, direct, translation, as, good, food, alternative, spellings, include, budgerygah, and, betcherrygah, the, latter, used, by, indigenous, people, of, the, liverpool, plains, in, new, south, wales, alternative, names, for, the, budgerigar, include, the, shell, parrot, or, shell, parakeet, the, warbling, grass, parakeet, the, canary, parrot, the, zebra, parrot, the, flight, bird, and, the, scallop, parrot, although, more, often, used, as, a, common, name, for, small, parrots, in, the, genus, agapornis, the, name, lovebird, has, been, used, for, budgerigars, because, of, their, habit, of, close, perching, mutual, preening, and, their, long, term, pair, bonds, lories, and, lorikeets, budgerigar, other, parrots, the, budgerigar, was, first, described, by, george, shaw, in, 1805, and, given, its, current, binomial, name, by, john, gould, in, 1840, the, genus, name, melopsittacus, from, ancient, greek, means, melodious, parrot, the, species, name, undulatus, is, latin, for, undulated, or, wave, patterned, the, budgerigar, was, once, proposed, to, be, a, link, between, the, genera, neophema, and, pezoporus, based, on, the, barred, plumage, however, recent, phylogenetic, studies, using, dna, sequences, place, the, budgerigar, very, close, to, the, lories, tribe, loriini, and, the, fig, parrots, tribe, cyclopsittini, wild, budgerigars, average, 18, cm, 7, in, long, weigh, 30, 40, grams, 1, 1, 1, 4, oz, 30, cm, 12, in, in, wingspan, and, display, a, light, green, body, colour, abdomen, and, rumps, while, their, mantles, back, and, wing, coverts, display, pitch, black, mantle, markings, blackish, in, fledglings, and, immatures, edged, in, clear, yellow, undulations, the, forehead, and, face, is, yellow, in, adults, prior, to, their, adult, plumage, young, individuals, have, blackish, stripes, down, to, the, cere, nose, in, young, individuals, until, around, 3, 4, months, of, age, they, display, small, iridescent, blue, violet, cheek, patches, and, a, series, of, three, black, spots, across, each, side, of, their, throats, called, throat, patches, the, two, outermost, throat, spots, are, situated, at, the, base, of, each, cheek, patch, the, tail, is, cobalt, dark, blue, and, outside, tail, feathers, display, central, yellow, flashes, their, wings, have, greenish, black, flight, feathers, and, black, coverts, with, yellow, fringes, along, with, central, yellow, flashes, which, only, become, visible, in, flight, or, when, the, wings, are, outstretched, bills, are, olive, grey, and, legs, blueish, grey, with, zygodactyl, toes, in, their, natural, australian, habitat, budgerigars, are, noticeably, smaller, than, those, in, captivity, this, particular, parrot, species, has, been, bred, in, many, other, colours, and, shades, in, captivity, e, g, blue, grey, grey, green, pieds, violet, white, yellow, blue, pet, store, individuals, will, commonly, be, blue, green, or, yellow, like, most, parrot, species, budgerigar, plumage, fluoresces, under, ultraviolet, light, a, phenomenon, possibly, related, to, courtship, and, mate, selection, the, colour, of, the, cere, the, area, containing, the, nostrils, differs, between, the, sexes, being, a, lavender, baby, blue, in, males, pale, brownish, white, non, breeding, to, brown, breeding, in, females, and, pink, in, immature, birds, of, both, sexes, usually, of, a, more, even, purplish, pink, colour, in, young, males, some, female, budgerigars, develop, brown, cere, only, during, breeding, time, which, later, returns, to, the, normal, colour, young, females, can, often, be, identified, by, a, subtle, chalky, whiteness, that, starts, around, the, nostrils, males, that, are, either, albino, lutino, dark, eyed, clear, or, recessive, pied, danish, pied, or, harlequin, retain, the, immature, purplish, pink, cere, colour, for, their, entire, lives, mature, males, usually, have, a, cere, of, light, to, dark, blue, but, in, some, particular, colour, mutations, it, can, be, periwinkle, lavender, purplish, or, pink, including, dark, eyed, clears, danish, pieds, recessive, pieds, and, inos, which, usually, display, much, rounder, heads, female, budgerigars, display, more, dominant, behaviour, compared, to, males, of, the, species, and, may, act, aggressively, towards, them, budgerigars, have, tetrachromatic, colour, vision, although, all, four, classes, of, cone, cells, will, not, operate, simultaneously, unless, under, sunlight, or, a, uv, lamp, the, ultraviolet, spectrum, brightens, their, feathers, to, attract, mates, the, throat, spots, in, budgerigars, reflect, uv, and, can, be, used, to, distinguish, individual, birds, while, ultraviolet, light, is, essential, to, the, good, health, of, caged, and, pet, birds, inadequate, darkness, or, rest, results, in, overstimulation, all, captive, budgerigars, are, divided, into, two, basic, series, of, colours, namely, white, based, blue, grey, and, white, and, yellow, based, green, grey, green, and, yellow, presently, at, least, 32, primary, mutations, including, violet, occur, enabling, hundreds, of, possible, secondary, mutations, stable, combined, primary, mutations, and, colour, varieties, unstable, combined, mutations, budgerigars, are, nomadic, and, flocks, move, on, from, sites, as, environmental, conditions, change, budgerigars, are, found, in, open, habitats, primarily, in, scrublands, open, woodlands, and, grasslands, of, australia, the, birds, are, normally, found, in, small, flocks, but, can, form, very, large, flocks, under, favourable, conditions, the, nomadic, movement, of, the, flocks, is, tied, to, the, availability, of, food, and, water, budgerigars, have, two, distinct, flight, speeds, which, they, are, capable, of, switching, between, depending, on, the, circumstance, budgerigars, sometimes, swarm, together, in, groups, containing, thousands, of, individuals, drought, can, drive, flocks, into, more, wooded, habitat, or, coastal, areas, they, feed, on, the, seeds, of, spinifex, and, grass, and, sometimes, ripening, wheat, budgerigars, feed, primarily, on, grass, seeds, the, species, also, opportunistically, depredates, growing, cereal, crops, and, lawn, grass, seeds, due, to, the, low, water, content, of, the, seeds, they, rely, on, the, availability, of, freshwater, outside, of, australia, the, only, long, term, establishment, of, naturalised, feral, budgerigars, is, a, large, population, near, st, petersburg, florida, increased, competition, for, nesting, sites, from, european, starlings, and, house, sparrows, is, thought, to, be, a, primary, cause, of, the, florida, population, declining, from, the, 1980s, the, more, consistent, year, round, conditions, in, florida, significantly, reduced, their, nomadic, behaviour, the, species, has, been, introduced, to, various, locations, in, puerto, rico, and, the, united, states, breeding, in, the, wild, generally, takes, place, between, june, and, september, in, northern, australia, and, between, august, and, january, in, the, south, although, budgerigars, are, opportunistic, breeders, and, respond, to, rains, when, grass, seeds, become, most, abundant, budgerigars, are, monogamous, and, breed, in, large, colonies, throughout, their, range, they, show, signs, of, affection, to, their, flockmates, by, preening, or, feeding, one, another, budgerigars, feed, one, another, by, eating, the, seeds, themselves, and, then, regurgitating, it, into, their, flockmate, s, mouth, populations, in, some, areas, have, increased, as, a, result, of, increased, water, availability, at, farms, nests, are, made, in, holes, in, trees, fence, posts, or, logs, lying, on, the, ground, the, four, to, six, eggs, are, incubated, for, 18, 21, days, with, the, young, fledging, about, 30, days, after, hatching, in, the, wild, virtually, all, parrot, species, require, a, hollow, tree, or, a, hollow, log, as, a, nest, site, budgerigars, will, typically, breed, in, captivity, when, provided, with, a, nest, box, the, eggs, are, typically, one, to, two, centimetres, long, and, are, pearl, white, without, any, colouration, if, fertile, female, budgerigars, can, lay, eggs, without, a, male, partner, but, these, unfertilised, eggs, will, not, hatch, females, normally, have, a, whitish, tan, cere, however, when, the, female, is, laying, eggs, her, cere, turns, a, crusty, brown, colour, certain, female, budgies, may, always, keep, a, whitish, tan, cere, or, always, keep, a, crusty, brown, cere, regardless, of, breeding, condition, a, female, budgerigar, will, lay, her, eggs, on, alternating, days, after, the, first, one, there, is, usually, a, two, day, gap, until, the, next, she, will, usually, lay, between, four, and, eight, eggs, which, she, will, incubate, usually, starting, after, laying, her, second, or, third, for, about, 21, days, each, females, only, leave, their, nests, for, very, quick, defecations, stretches, and, quick, meals, once, they, have, begun, incubating, and, are, by, then, almost, exclusively, fed, by, their, mate, usually, at, the, nest, s, entrance, females, will, not, allow, a, male, to, enter, the, nest, unless, he, forces, his, way, inside, clutch, size, ranges, from, 6, to, 8, chicks, there, is, evidence, of, same, sex, sexual, behaviour, amongst, male, budgerigars, it, was, originally, hypothesised, that, they, did, this, as, a, form, of, courtship, practice, so, they, were, better, breeding, partners, for, females, however, an, inverse, relationship, exists, between, participation, in, same, sex, behaviour, and, pairing, success, breeding, difficulties, arise, for, various, reasons, some, chicks, may, die, from, diseases, and, attacks, from, adults, other, budgerigars, virtually, always, females, may, fight, over, the, nest, box, attacking, each, other, or, a, brood, another, problem, may, be, the, birds, beaks, being, under, lapped, where, the, lower, mandible, is, above, the, upper, mandible, most, health, issues, and, physical, abnormalities, in, budgerigars, are, genetic, care, should, be, taken, that, birds, used, for, breeding, are, active, healthy, and, unrelated, budgerigars, that, are, related, or, have, fatty, tumours, or, other, potential, genetic, health, problems, should, not, be, allowed, to, breed, parasites, lice, mites, worms, and, pathogens, bacteria, fungi, and, viruses, are, contagious, and, thus, transmitted, between, individuals, through, either, direct, or, indirect, contact, in, some, cases, chicks, will, experience, splay, leg, this, medical, condition, may, be, congenital, or, acquired, through, malnutrition, chicks, can, be, treated, with, splints, although, this, method, is, not, always, successful, in, curing, the, affected, bird, preventative, measures, include, using, proper, nesting, box, materials, such, as, pine, shavings, and, cleaning, the, nest, box, between, uses, eggs, take, about, 18, 20, days, before, they, start, hatching, the, hatchlings, are, altricial, blind, naked, unable, to, lift, their, head, and, totally, helpless, and, their, mother, feeds,

for, closed, banding, of, the, chicks, they, develop, feathers, around, three, weeks, of, age, one, can, often, easily, note, the, colour, mutation, of, the, individual, birds, at, this, point, at, this, stage, of, the, chicks, development, the, male, usually, has, begun, to, enter, the, nest, to, help, his, female, in, caring, and, feeding, the, chicks, some, budgerigar, females, however, totally, forbid, the, male, from, entering, the, nest, and, thus, take, the, full, responsibility, of, rearing, the, chicks, until, they, fledge, depending, on, the, size, of, the, clutch, and, most, particularly, in, the, case, of, single, mothers, it, may, then, be, wise, to, transfer, a, portion, of, the, hatchlings, or, best, of, the, fertile, eggs, to, another, pair, the, foster, pair, must, already, be, in, breeding, mode, and, thus, either, at, the, laying, or, incubating, stages, or, already, rearing, hatchlings, as, the, chicks, develop, and, grow, feathers, they, are, able, to, be, left, on, their, own, for, longer, periods, of, time, by, the, fifth, week, the, chicks, are, strong, enough, that, both, parents, will, be, comfortable, in, staying, out, of, the, nest, more, the, youngsters, will, stretch, their, wings, to, gain, strength, before, they, attempt, to, fly, they, will, also, help, defend, the, box, from, enemies, mostly, with, their, loud, screeching, young, budgerigars, typically, fledge, leave, the, nest, around, their, fifth, week, of, age, and, are, usually, completely, weaned, between, six, and, eight, weeks, old, however, the, age, for, fledging, as, well, as, weaning, can, vary, slightly, depending, on, the, age, and, the, number, of, surviving, chicks, generally, speaking, the, oldest, chick, is, the, first, to, be, weaned, although, it, is, logically, the, last, one, to, be, weaned, the, youngest, chick, is, often, weaned, at, a, younger, age, than, its, older, sibling, s, this, can, be, a, result, of, mimicking, the, actions, of, older, siblings, lone, surviving, chicks, are, often, weaned, at, the, youngest, possible, age, as, a, result, of, having, their, parents, full, attention, and, care, hand, reared, budgies, may, take, slightly, longer, to, wean, than, parent, raised, chicks, hand, feeding, is, not, routinely, done, with, budgerigars, due, to, their, small, size, and, because, young, parent, raised, birds, can, be, readily, tamed, the, budgerigar, has, been, bred, in, captivity, since, the, 1850s, breeders, have, worked, to, produce, a, variety, of, colour, pattern, and, feather, mutations, including, albino, blue, cinnamon, ino, lacewing, clearwing, crested, dark, greywing, opaline, pieds, spangled, dilute, suffused, and, violet, english, budgerigars, more, correctly, called, show, or, exhibition, budgerigars, are, about, twice, as, large, as, their, wild, counterparts, and, have, puffier, head, feathers, giving, them, a, boldly, exaggerated, look, the, eyes, and, beak, can, be, almost, totally, obscured, by, these, fluffy, head, feathers, english, budgerigars, are, typically, more, expensive, than, wild, type, birds, and, have, a, shorter, life, span, of, about, seven, to, nine, years, breeders, of, english, budgerigars, show, their, birds, at, animal, shows, most, captive, budgerigars, in, the, pet, trade, are, more, similar, in, size, and, body, conformation, to, wild, budgerigars, budgerigars, are, social, animals, and, require, stimulation, in, the, shape, of, toys, and, interaction, with, humans, or, with, other, budgerigars, budgerigars, and, especially, females, will, chew, material, such, as, wood, when, a, budgerigar, feels, threatened, it, will, try, to, perch, as, high, as, possible, and, to, bring, its, feathers, close, against, its, body, in, order, to, appear, thinner, tame, budgerigars, can, be, taught, to, speak, whistle, and, play, with, humans, both, males, and, females, sing, and, can, learn, to, mimic, sounds, and, words, and, do, simple, tricks, but, singing, and, mimicry, are, more, pronounced, and, better, perfected, in, males, females, rarely, learn, to, mimic, more, than, a, dozen, words, males, can, easily, acquire, vocabularies, ranging, from, a, few, dozen, to, a, hundred, words, pet, males, especially, those, kept, alone, are, generally, the, best, speakers, budgerigars, will, chew, on, anything, they, can, find, to, keep, their, beaks, trimmed, mineral, blocks, ideally, enriched, with, iodine, cuttlebone, and, soft, wooden, pieces, are, suitable, for, this, activity, cuttlebones, also, supply, calcium, essential, for, the, proper, forming, of, eggs, and, bone, solidity, in, captivity, budgerigars, live, an, average, of, five, to, eight, years, but, life, spans, of, 15, 20, years, have, been, reported, the, life, span, depends, on, breed, lineage, and, health, being, highly, influenced, by, exercise, and, diet, budgerigars, have, been, known, to, cause, bird, fancier, s, lung, in, sensitive, people, a, type, of, hypersensitivity, pneumonitis, apart, from, a, handful, of, illnesses, diseases, of, the, species, are, not, transmittable, to, humans, budgerigars, like, many, other, species, of, parrot, are, able, to, mimic, human, speech, puck, a, male, budgerigar, owned, by, american, camille, jordan, holds, the, world, record, for, the, largest, vocabulary, of, any, bird, at, 1, 728, words, puck, died, in, 1994, with, the, record, first, appearing, in, the, 1995, edition, of, guinness, world, records, the, budgerigar, disco, became, internet, famous, in, 2013, some, of,
