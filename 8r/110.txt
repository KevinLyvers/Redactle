in, zoology, a, scale, ancient, greek, romanized, lep, s, latin, squ, ma, is, a, small, rigid, plate, that, grows, out, of, an, animal, s, skin, to, provide, protection, in, lepidopterans, butterflies, and, moths, scales, are, plates, on, the, surface, of, the, insect, wing, and, provide, coloration, scales, are, quite, common, and, have, evolved, multiple, times, through, convergent, evolution, with, varying, structure, and, function, scales, are, generally, classified, as, part, of, an, organism, s, integumentary, system, there, are, various, types, of, scales, according, to, the, shape, and, class, of, an, animal, fish, scales, are, dermally, derived, specifically, in, the, mesoderm, this, fact, distinguishes, them, from, reptile, scales, paleontologically, genetically, the, same, genes, involved, in, tooth, and, hair, development, in, mammals, are, also, involved, in, scale, development, true, cosmoid, scales, can, only, be, found, on, the, sarcopterygians, the, inner, layer, of, the, scale, is, made, of, lamellar, bone, on, top, of, this, lies, a, layer, of, spongy, or, vascular, bone, and, then, a, layer, of, dentine, like, material, called, cosmine, the, upper, surface, is, keratin, the, coelacanth, has, modified, cosmoid, scales, that, lack, cosmine, and, are, thinner, than, true, cosmoid, scales, ganoid, scales, can, be, found, on, gars, family, lepisosteidae, bichirs, and, reedfishes, family, polypteridae, ganoid, scales, are, similar, to, cosmoid, scales, but, a, layer, of, ganoin, lies, over, the, cosmine, layer, and, under, the, enamel, ganoin, scales, are, diamond, shaped, shiny, and, hard, within, the, ganoin, are, guanine, compounds, iridescent, derivatives, of, guanine, found, in, a, dna, molecule, the, iridescent, property, of, these, chemicals, provide, the, ganoin, its, shine, placoid, scales, are, found, on, cartilaginous, fish, including, sharks, and, stingrays, these, scales, also, called, denticles, are, similar, in, structure, to, teeth, and, have, one, median, spine, and, two, lateral, spines, the, modern, jawed, fish, ancestors, the, jawless, ostracoderms, and, later, jawed, placoderms, may, have, had, scales, with, the, properties, of, both, placoid, and, ganoid, scales, leptoid, scales, are, found, on, higher, order, bony, fish, as, they, grow, they, add, concentric, layers, they, are, arranged, so, as, to, overlap, in, a, head, to, tail, direction, like, roof, tiles, allowing, a, smoother, flow, of, water, over, the, body, and, therefore, reducing, drag, they, come, in, two, forms, reptile, scale, types, include, cycloid, granular, which, appear, bumpy, and, keeled, which, have, a, center, ridge, scales, usually, vary, in, size, the, stouter, larger, scales, cover, parts, that, are, often, exposed, to, physical, stress, usually, the, feet, tail, and, head, while, scales, are, small, around, the, joints, for, flexibility, most, snakes, have, extra, broad, scales, on, the, belly, each, scale, covering, the, belly, from, side, to, side, the, scales, of, all, reptiles, have, an, epidermal, component, what, one, sees, on, the, surface, but, many, reptiles, such, as, crocodilians, and, turtles, have, osteoderms, underlying, the, epidermal, scale, such, scales, are, more, properly, termed, scutes, snakes, tuataras, and, many, lizards, lack, osteoderms, all, reptilian, scales, have, a, dermal, papilla, underlying, the, epidermal, part, and, it, is, there, that, the, osteoderms, if, present, would, be, formed, birds, scales, are, found, mainly, on, the, toes, and, metatarsus, but, may, be, found, further, up, on, the, ankle, in, some, birds, the, scales, and, scutes, of, birds, were, thought, to, be, homologous, to, those, of, reptiles, but, are, now, agreed, to, have, evolved, independently, being, degenerate, feathers, an, example, of, a, scaled, mammal, is, the, pangolin, its, scales, are, made, of, keratin, and, are, used, for, protection, similar, to, an, armadillo, s, armor, they, have, been, convergently, evolved, being, unrelated, to, mammals, distant, reptile, like, ancestors, since, therapsids, lost, scales, except, that, they, use, a, similar, gene, on, the, other, hand, the, musky, rat, kangaroo, has, scales, on, its, feet, and, tail, the, precise, nature, of, its, purported, scales, has, not, been, studied, in, detail, but, they, appear, to, be, structurally, different, from, pangolin, scales, anomalures, also, have, scales, on, their, tail, undersides, foot, pad, epidermal, tissues, in, most, mammal, species, have, been, compared, to, the, scales, of, other, vertebrates, they, are, likely, derived, from, cornification, processes, or, stunted, fur, much, like, avian, reticulae, are, derived, from, stunted, feathers, butterflies, and, moths, the, order, lepidoptera, greek, scale, winged, have, membranous, wings, covered, in, delicate, powdery, scales, which, are, modified, setae, each, scale, consists, of, a, series, of, tiny, stacked, platelets, of, organic, material, and, butterflies, tend, to, have, the, scales, broad, and, flattened, while, moths, tend, to, have, the, scales, narrower, and, more, hair, like, scales, are, usually, pigmented, but, some, types, of, scales, are, iridescent, without, pigments, because, the, thickness, of, the, platelets, is, on, the, same, order, as, the, wavelength, of, visible, light, the, plates, lead, to, structural, coloration, and, iridescence, through, the, physical, phenomenon, described, as, thin, film, optics, the, most, common, color, produced, in, this, fashion, is, blue, such, as, in, the, morpho, butterflies, some, types, of, spiders, also, have, scales, spider, scales, are, flattened, setae, that, overlay, the, surface, of, the, cuticle, they, come, in, a, wide, variety, of, shapes, sizes, and, colors, at, least, 13, different, spider, families, are, known, to, possess, cuticular, scales, although, they, have, only, been, well, described, for, jumping, spiders, salticidae, and, lynx, spiders, oxyopidae, some, crustaceans, such, as, glyptonotus, antarcticus, have, knobbly, scales, some, crayfish, have, been, shown, to, use, antennal, scales, that, are, activated, in, rapid, response, movements
