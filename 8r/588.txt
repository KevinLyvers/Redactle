allosaurus, l, s, r, s, is, an, extinct, genus, of, large, carnosaurian, theropod, dinosaur, that, lived, 155, to, 145, million, years, ago, during, the, late, jurassic, period, kimmeridgian, to, late, tithonian, ages, the, name, allosaurus, means, different, lizard, alluding, to, its, unique, at, the, time, of, its, discovery, concave, vertebrae, it, is, derived, from, the, greek, words, allos, different, strange, or, other, and, sauros, lizard, or, reptile, the, first, fossil, remains, that, could, definitively, be, ascribed, to, this, genus, were, described, in, 1877, by, famed, paleontologist, othniel, charles, marsh, as, one, of, the, first, well, known, theropod, dinosaurs, it, has, long, attracted, attention, outside, of, paleontological, circles, allosaurus, was, a, large, bipedal, predator, for, its, time, its, skull, was, light, robust, and, equipped, with, dozens, of, sharp, serrated, teeth, it, averaged, 8, 5, metres, 28, ft, in, length, for, a, fragilis, with, the, largest, specimens, estimated, as, being, 9, 7, metres, 32, ft, long, relative, to, the, large, and, powerful, legs, its, three, fingered, hands, were, small, and, the, body, was, balanced, by, a, long, muscular, tail, it, is, classified, as, an, allosaurid, a, type, of, carnosaurian, theropod, dinosaur, the, genus, has, a, very, complicated, taxonomy, and, includes, at, least, three, valid, species, the, best, known, of, which, is, a, fragilis, the, bulk, of, allosaurus, remains, have, come, from, north, america, s, morrison, formation, with, material, also, known, from, the, lourinh, formation, in, portugal, it, was, known, for, over, half, of, the, 20th, century, as, antrodemus, but, a, study, of, the, abundant, remains, from, the, cleveland, lloyd, dinosaur, quarry, returned, the, name, allosaurus, to, prominence, as, the, most, abundant, large, predator, of, the, morrison, formation, allosaurus, was, at, the, top, of, the, food, chain, and, probably, preyed, on, contemporaneous, large, herbivorous, dinosaurs, with, the, possibility, of, hunting, other, predators, potential, prey, included, ornithopods, stegosaurids, and, sauropods, some, paleontologists, interpret, allosaurus, as, having, had, cooperative, social, behavior, and, hunting, in, packs, while, others, believe, individuals, may, have, been, aggressive, toward, each, other, and, that, congregations, of, this, genus, are, the, result, of, lone, individuals, feeding, on, the, same, carcasses, the, discovery, and, early, study, of, allosaurus, is, complicated, by, the, multiplicity, of, names, coined, during, the, bone, wars, of, the, late, 19th, century, the, first, described, fossil, in, this, history, was, a, bone, obtained, secondhand, by, ferdinand, vandeveer, hayden, in, 1869, it, came, from, middle, park, near, granby, colorado, probably, from, morrison, formation, rocks, the, locals, had, identified, such, bones, as, petrified, horse, hoofs, hayden, sent, his, specimen, to, joseph, leidy, who, identified, it, as, half, of, a, tail, vertebra, and, tentatively, assigned, it, to, the, european, dinosaur, genus, poekilopleuron, as, poicilopleuron, valens, he, later, decided, it, deserved, its, own, genus, antrodemus, allosaurus, itself, is, based, on, ypm, 1930, a, small, collection, of, fragmentary, bones, including, parts, of, three, vertebrae, a, rib, fragment, a, tooth, a, toe, bone, and, most, useful, for, later, discussions, the, shaft, of, the, right, humerus, upper, arm, othniel, charles, marsh, gave, these, remains, the, formal, name, allosaurus, fragilis, in, 1877, allosaurus, comes, from, the, greek, words, allos, meaning, strange, or, different, and, sauros, meaning, lizard, or, reptile, it, was, named, different, lizard, because, its, vertebrae, were, different, from, those, of, other, dinosaurs, known, at, the, time, of, its, discovery, the, species, epithet, fragilis, is, latin, for, fragile, referring, to, lightening, features, in, the, vertebrae, the, bones, were, collected, from, the, morrison, formation, of, garden, park, north, of, ca, on, city, o, c, marsh, and, edward, drinker, cope, who, were, in, scientific, competition, with, each, other, went, on, to, coin, several, other, genera, based, on, similarly, sparse, material, that, would, later, figure, in, the, taxonomy, of, allosaurus, these, include, marsh, s, creosaurus, and, labrosaurus, as, well, as, cope, s, epanterias, in, their, haste, cope, and, marsh, did, not, always, follow, up, on, their, discoveries, or, more, commonly, those, made, by, their, subordinates, for, example, after, the, discovery, by, benjamin, mudge, of, the, type, specimen, of, allosaurus, in, colorado, marsh, elected, to, concentrate, work, in, wyoming, when, work, resumed, at, garden, park, in, 1883, m, p, felch, found, an, almost, complete, allosaurus, and, several, partial, skeletons, in, addition, one, of, cope, s, collectors, h, f, hubbell, found, a, specimen, in, the, como, bluff, area, of, wyoming, in, 1879, but, apparently, did, not, mention, its, completeness, and, cope, never, unpacked, it, upon, unpacking, it, in, 1903, several, years, after, cope, had, died, it, was, found, to, be, one, of, the, most, complete, theropod, specimens, then, known, and, the, skeleton, now, cataloged, as, amnh, 5753, was, put, on, public, view, in, 1908, this, is, the, well, known, mount, poised, over, a, partial, apatosaurus, skeleton, as, if, scavenging, it, illustrated, as, such, in, a, painting, by, charles, r, knight, although, notable, as, the, first, free, standing, mount, of, a, theropod, dinosaur, and, often, illustrated, and, photographed, it, has, never, been, scientifically, described, the, multiplicity, of, early, names, complicated, later, research, with, the, situation, compounded, by, the, terse, descriptions, provided, by, marsh, and, cope, even, at, the, time, authors, such, as, samuel, wendell, williston, suggested, that, too, many, names, had, been, coined, for, example, williston, pointed, out, in, 1901, that, marsh, had, never, been, able, to, adequately, distinguish, allosaurus, from, creosaurus, the, most, influential, early, attempt, to, sort, out, the, convoluted, situation, was, produced, by, charles, w, gilmore, in, 1920, he, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, tail, vertebra, named, antrodemus, by, leidy, was, indistinguishable, from, those, of, allosaurus, and, that, antrodemus, should, be, the, preferred, name, because, as, the, older, name, it, had, priority, antrodemus, became, the, accepted, name, for, this, familiar, genus, for, over, 50, years, until, james, henry, madsen, published, on, the, cleveland, lloyd, specimens, and, concluded, that, allosaurus, should, be, used, because, antrodemus, was, based, on, material, with, poor, if, any, diagnostic, features, and, locality, information, for, example, the, geological, formation, that, the, single, bone, of, antrodemus, came, from, is, unknown, antrodemus, has, been, used, informally, for, convenience, when, distinguishing, between, the, skull, gilmore, restored, and, the, composite, skull, restored, by, madsen, although, sporadic, work, at, what, became, known, as, the, cleveland, lloyd, dinosaur, quarry, in, emery, county, utah, had, taken, place, as, early, as, 1927, and, the, fossil, site, itself, described, by, william, l, stokes, in, 1945, major, operations, did, not, begin, there, until, 1960, under, a, cooperative, effort, involving, nearly, 40, institutions, thousands, of, bones, were, recovered, between, 1960, and, 1965, led, by, james, henry, madsen, the, quarry, is, notable, for, the, predominance, of, allosaurus, remains, the, condition, of, the, specimens, and, the, lack, of, scientific, resolution, on, how, it, came, to, be, the, majority, of, bones, belong, to, the, large, theropod, allosaurus, fragilis, it, is, estimated, that, the, remains, of, at, least, 46, a, fragilis, have, been, found, there, out, of, at, a, minimum, 73, dinosaurs, and, the, fossils, found, there, are, disarticulated, and, well, mixed, nearly, a, dozen, scientific, papers, have, been, written, on, the, taphonomy, of, the, site, suggesting, numerous, mutually, exclusive, explanations, for, how, it, may, have, formed, suggestions, have, ranged, from, animals, getting, stuck, in, a, bog, becoming, trapped, in, deep, mud, falling, victim, to, drought, induced, mortality, around, a, waterhole, and, getting, trapped, in, a, spring, fed, pond, or, seep, regardless, of, the, actual, cause, the, great, quantity, of, well, preserved, allosaurus, remains, has, allowed, this, genus, to, be, known, in, great, detail, making, it, among, the, best, known, of, all, theropods, skeletal, remains, from, the, quarry, pertain, to, individuals, of, almost, all, ages, and, sizes, from, less, than, 1, metre, 3, 3, feet, to, 12, metres, 39, feet, long, and, the, disarticulation, is, an, advantage, for, describing, bones, usually, found, fused, due, to, being, one, of, utah, s, two, fossil, quarries, where, numerous, allosaurus, specimens, have, been, discovered, allosaurus, was, designated, as, the, state, fossil, of, utah, in, 1988, the, period, since, madsen, s, monograph, has, been, marked, by, a, great, expansion, in, studies, dealing, with, topics, concerning, allosaurus, in, life, paleobiological, and, paleoecological, topics, such, studies, have, covered, topics, including, skeletal, variation, growth, skull, construction, hunting, methods, the, brain, and, the, possibility, of, gregarious, living, and, parental, care, reanalysis, of, old, material, particularly, of, large, allosaur, specimens, new, discoveries, in, portugal, and, several, very, complete, new, specimens, have, also, contributed, to, the, growing, knowledge, base, in, 1991, big, al, mor, 693, a, 95, complete, partially, articulated, specimen, of, allosaurus, was, discovered, measuring, about, 8, metres, 26, ft, long, mor, 693, was, excavated, near, shell, wyoming, by, a, joint, museum, of, the, rockies, and, university, of, wyoming, geological, museum, team, this, skeleton, was, discovered, by, a, swiss, team, led, by, kirby, siber, chure, and, loewen, in, 2020, identified, the, individual, as, a, representative, of, the, species, allosaurus, jimmadseni, in, 1996, the, same, team, discovered, a, second, allosaurus, big, al, ii, this, specimen, the, best, preserved, skeleton, of, its, kind, to, date, is, also, referred, to, allosaurus, jimmadseni, the, completeness, preservation, and, scientific, importance, of, this, skeleton, gave, big, al, its, name, the, individual, itself, was, below, the, average, size, for, allosaurus, fragilis, as, it, was, a, subadult, estimated, at, only, 87, grown, the, specimen, was, described, by, breithaupt, in, 1996, nineteen, of, its, bones, were, broken, or, showed, signs, of, serious, infection, which, may, have, contributed, to, big, al, s, death, pathologic, bones, included, five, ribs, five, vertebrae, and, four, bones, of, the, feet, several, of, its, damaged, bones, showed, signs, of, osteomyelitis, a, severe, bone, infection, a, particular, problem, for, the, living, animal, was, infection, and, trauma, to, the, right, foot, that, probably, affected, movement, and, may, have, also, predisposed, the, other, foot, to, injury, because, of, a, change, in, gait, big, al, had, an, infection, on, the, first, phalanx, on, the, third, toe, that, was, afflicted, by, an, involucrum, the, infection, was, long, lived, perhaps, up, to, six, months, big, al, ii, is, also, known, to, have, multiple, injuries, six, species, of, allosaurus, have, been, named, a, amplus, a, atrox, a, europaeus, the, type, species, a, fragilis, a, jimmadseni, and, a, lucasi, among, these, daniel, chure, and, mark, loewen, in, 2020, only, recognized, the, species, a, fragilis, a, europaeus, and, the, newly, named, a, jimmadseni, as, being, valid, species, however, a, europaeus, does, not, show, any, unique, characters, compared, to, the, north, american, species, so, a, reevaluation, of, its, validity, is, required, a, fragilis, is, the, type, species, and, was, named, by, marsh, in, 1877, it, is, known, from, the, remains, of, at, least, 60, individuals, all, found, in, the, kimmeridgian, tithonian, upper, jurassic, age, morrison, formation, of, the, united, states, spread, across, colorado, montana, new, mexico, oklahoma, south, dakota, utah, and, wyoming, details, of, the, humerus, upper, arm, of, a, fragilis, have, been, used, as, diagnostic, among, morrison, theropods, but, a, jimmadseni, indicates, that, this, is, no, longer, the, case, at, the, species, level, a, jimmadseni, has, been, scientifically, described, based, on, two, nearly, complete, skeletons, the, first, specimen, to, wear, the, identification, was, unearthed, in, dinosaur, national, monument, in, northeastern, utah, with, the, original, big, al, individual, subsequently, recognized, as, belonging, to, the, same, species, this, species, differs, from, a, fragilis, in, several, anatomical, details, including, a, jugal, cheekbone, with, a, straight, lower, margin, fossils, are, confined, to, the, salt, wash, member, of, the, morrison, formation, with, a, fragilis, only, found, in, the, higher, brushy, basin, member, a, fragilis, a, jimmadseni, a, amplus, and, a, lucasi, are, all, known, from, remains, discovered, in, the, kimmeridgian, tithonian, upper, jurassic, age, morrison, formation, of, the, united, states, spread, across, colorado, montana, new, mexico, oklahoma, south, dakota, utah, and, wyoming, a, fragilis, is, regarded, as, the, most, common, known, from, the, remains, of, at, least, 60, individuals, for, a, while, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, it, was, common, to, recognize, a, fragilis, as, the, short, snouted, species, with, the, long, snouted, taxon, being, a, atrox, however, subsequent, analysis, of, specimens, from, the, cleveland, lloyd, dinosaur, quarry, como, bluff, and, dry, mesa, quarry, showed, that, the, differences, seen, in, the, morrison, formation, material, could, be, attributed, to, individual, variation, a, study, of, skull, elements, from, the, cleveland, lloyd, site, found, wide, variation, between, individuals, calling, into, question, previous, species, level, distinctions, based, on, such, features, as, the, shape, of, the, lacrimal, horns, and, the, proposed, differentiation, of, a, jimmadseni, based, on, the, shape, of, the, jugal, a, europaeus, was, found, in, the, kimmeridgian, age, porto, novo, member, of, the, lourinh, formation, but, it, may, be, the, same, as, a, fragilis, allosaurus, material, from, portugal, was, first, reported, in, 1999, on, the, basis, of, mhnul, and, 001, a, partial, skeleton, including, a, quadrate, vertebrae, ribs, gastralia, chevrons, part, of, the, hips, and, legs, this, specimen, was, assigned, to, a, fragilis, but, the, subsequent, discovery, of, a, partial, skull, and, neck, ml, 415, near, lourinh, in, the, kimmeridgian, age, porto, novo, member, of, the, lourinh, formation, spurred, the, naming, of, the, new, species, as, a, europaeus, by, oct, vio, mateus, and, colleagues, the, species, appeared, earlier, in, the, jurassic, than, a, fragilis, and, differs, from, other, species, of, allosaurus, in, cranial, details, however, more, material, may, show, it, to, be, a, fragilis, as, originally, described, the, issue, of, species, and, potential, synonyms, is, complicated, by, the, type, specimen, of, allosaurus, fragilis, ypm, 1930, being, extremely, fragmentary, consisting, of, a, few, incomplete, vertebrae, limb, fragments, rib, fragments, and, a, single, tooth, because, of, this, several, scientists, have, interpreted, the, type, specimen, as, potentially, dubious, meaning, the, genus, allosaurus, itself, or, at, least, the, species, a, fragilis, would, be, a, nomen, dubium, dubious, name, based, on, a, specimen, too, incomplete, to, compare, to, other, specimens, or, to, classify, to, address, this, situation, gregory, s, paul, and, kenneth, carpenter, 2010, submitted, a, petition, to, the, iczn, to, have, the, name, a, fragilis, officially, transferred, to, the, more, complete, specimen, usnm4734, as, a, neotype, a, decision, that, was, ratified, by, the, iczn, on, december, 29, 2023, creosaurus, epanterias, and, labrosaurus, are, regarded, as, junior, synonyms, of, allosaurus, most, of, the, species, that, are, regarded, as, synonyms, of, a, fragilis, or, that, were, misassigned, to, the, genus, are, obscure, and, based, on, very, scrappy, remains, one, exception, is, labrosaurus, ferox, named, in, 1884, by, marsh, for, an, oddly, formed, partial, lower, jaw, with, a, prominent, gap, in, the, tooth, row, at, the, tip, of, the, jaw, and, a, rear, section, greatly, expanded, and, turned, down, later, researchers, suggested, that, the, bone, was, pathologic, showing, an, injury, to, the, living, animal, and, that, part, of, the, unusual, form, of, the, rear, of, the, bone, was, due, to, plaster, reconstruction, it, is, now, regarded, as, an, example, of, a, fragilis, in, his, 1988, book, predatory, dinosaurs, of, the, world, the, freelance, artist, author, gregory, s, paul, proposed, that, a, fragilis, had, tall, pointed, horns, and, a, slender, build, compared, to, a, postulated, second, species, a, atrox, as, well, as, not, being, a, different, sex, due, to, rarity, allosaurus, atrox, was, originally, named, by, marsh, in, 1878, as, the, type, species, of, its, own, genus, creosaurus, and, is, based, on, ypm, 1890, an, assortment, of, bones, that, includes, a, couple, of, pieces, of, the, skull, portions, of, nine, tail, vertebrae, two, hip, vertebrae, an, ilium, and, ankle, and, foot, bones, although, the, idea, of, two, common, morrison, allosaur, species, was, followed, in, some, semi, technical, and, popular, works, the, 2000, thesis, on, allosauridae, noted, that, charles, gilmore, mistakenly, reconstructed, usnm, 4734, as, having, a, shorter, skull, than, the, specimens, referred, by, paul, to, atrox, refuting, supposed, differences, between, usnm, 4734, and, putative, a, atrox, specimens, like, dino, 2560, amnh, 600, and, amnh, 666, allosaurus, agilis, seen, in, zittel, 1887, and, osborn, 1912, is, a, typographical, error, for, a, fragilis, allosaurus, ferox, is, a, typographical, error, by, marsh, for, a, fragilis, in, a, figure, caption, for, the, partial, skull, ypm, 1893, and, ypm, 1893, has, been, treated, as, a, specimen, of, a, fragilis, likewise, labrosaurus, fragilis, is, a, typographical, error, by, marsh, 1896, for, labrosaurus, ferox, a, whitei, is, a, nomen, nudum, coined, by, pickering, in, 1996, for, the, complete, allosaurus, specimens, that, paul, referred, to, a, atrox, madsenius, was, coined, by, david, lambert, in, 1990, being, based, on, remains, from, dinosaur, national, monument, assigned, to, allosaurus, or, creosaurus, a, synonym, of, allosaurus, and, was, to, be, described, by, paleontologist, robert, bakker, as, madsenius, trux, however, madsenius, is, now, seen, as, yet, another, synonym, of, allosaurus, because, bakker, s, action, was, predicated, upon, the, false, assumption, of, usnm, 4734, being, distinct, from, long, snouted, allosaurus, due, to, errors, in, gilmore, s, 1920, reconstruction, of, usnm, 4734, wyomingraptor, was, informally, coined, by, bakker, for, allosaurid, remains, from, the, morrison, formation, of, the, late, jurassic, the, remains, unearthed, are, labeled, as, allosaurus, and, are, housed, in, the, tate, geological, museum, however, there, has, been, no, official, description, of, the, remains, and, wyomingraptor, has, been, dismissed, as, a, nomen, nudum, with, the, remains, referable, to, allosaurus, several, species, initially, classified, within, or, referred, to, allosaurus, do, not, belong, within, the, genus, a, medius, was, named, by, marsh, in, 1888, for, various, specimens, from, the, early, cretaceous, arundel, formation, of, maryland, although, most, of, the, remains, were, removed, by, richard, swann, lull, to, the, new, ornithopod, species, dryosaurus, grandis, except, for, a, tooth, it, was, transferred, to, antrodemus, by, oliver, hay, in, 1902, but, hay, later, clarified, that, this, was, an, inexplicable, error, on, his, part, gilmore, considered, the, tooth, nondiagnostic, but, transferred, it, to, dryptosaurus, as, d, medius, the, referral, was, not, accepted, in, the, most, recent, review, of, basal, tetanurans, and, allosaurus, medius, was, simply, listed, as, a, dubious, species, of, theropod, it, may, be, closely, related, to, acrocanthosaurus, allosaurus, valens, is, a, new, combination, for, antrodemus, valens, used, by, friedrich, von, huene, in, 1932, antrodemus, valens, itself, may, also, pertain, to, allosaurus, fragilis, as, gilmore, suggested, in, 1920, a, lucaris, another, marsh, name, was, given, to, a, partial, skeleton, in, 1878, he, later, decided, it, warranted, its, own, genus, labrosaurus, but, this, has, not, been, accepted, and, a, lucaris, is, also, regarded, as, another, specimen, of, a, fragilis, allosaurus, lucaris, is, known, mostly, from, vertebrae, sharing, characters, with, allosaurus, paul, and, carpenter, stated, that, the, type, specimen, of, this, species, ypm, 1931, was, from, a, younger, age, than, allosaurus, and, might, represent, a, different, genus, however, they, found, that, the, specimen, was, undiagnostic, and, thus, a, lucaris, was, a, nomen, dubium, allosaurus, sibiricus, was, described, in, 1914, by, a, n, riabinin, on, the, basis, of, a, bone, later, identified, as, a, partial, fourth, metatarsal, from, the, early, cretaceous, of, buryatia, russia, it, was, transferred, to, chilantaisaurus, in, 1990, but, is, now, considered, a, nomen, dubium, indeterminate, beyond, theropoda, allosaurus, meriani, was, a, new, combination, by, george, olshevsky, for, megalosaurus, meriani, greppin, 1870, based, on, a, tooth, from, the, late, jurassic, of, switzerland, however, a, recent, overview, of, ceratosaurus, included, it, in, ceratosaurus, sp, apatodon, mirus, based, on, a, scrap, of, vertebra, marsh, first, thought, to, be, a, mammalian, jaw, has, been, listed, as, a, synonym, of, allosaurus, fragilis, however, it, was, considered, indeterminate, beyond, dinosauria, by, chure, and, mickey, mortimer, believes, that, the, synonymy, of, apatodon, with, allosaurus, was, due, to, correspondence, to, ralph, molnar, by, john, mcintosh, whereby, the, latter, reportedly, found, a, paper, saying, that, othniel, charles, marsh, admitted, that, the, apatodon, holotype, was, actually, an, allosaurid, dorsal, vertebra, a, amplexus, was, named, by, gregory, s, paul, for, giant, morrison, allosaur, remains, and, included, in, his, conception, saurophagus, maximus, later, saurophaganax, a, amplexus, was, originally, coined, by, cope, in, 1878, as, the, type, species, of, his, new, genus, epanterias, and, is, based, on, what, is, now, amnh, 5767, parts, of, three, vertebrae, a, coracoid, and, a, metatarsal, following, paul, s, work, this, species, has, been, accepted, as, a, synonym, of, a, fragilis, a, 2010, study, by, paul, and, kenneth, carpenter, however, indicates, that, epanterias, is, temporally, younger, than, the, a, fragilis, type, specimen, so, it, is, a, separate, species, at, minimum, a, maximus, was, a, new, combination, by, david, k, smith, for, chure, s, saurophaganax, maximus, a, taxon, created, by, chure, in, 1995, for, giant, allosaurid, remains, from, the, morrison, of, oklahoma, these, remains, had, been, known, as, saurophagus, but, that, name, was, already, in, use, leading, chure, to, propose, a, substitute, smith, in, his, 1998, analysis, of, variation, concluded, that, s, maximus, was, not, different, enough, from, allosaurus, to, be, a, separate, genus, but, did, warrant, its, own, species, a, maximus, this, reassignment, was, rejected, in, a, review, of, basal, tetanurans, there, are, also, several, species, left, over, from, the, synonymizations, of, creosaurus, and, labrosaurus, with, allosaurus, creosaurus, potens, was, named, by, lull, in, 1911, for, a, vertebra, from, the, early, cretaceous, of, maryland, it, is, now, regarded, as, a, dubious, theropod, labrosaurus, stechowi, described, in, 1920, by, janensch, based, on, isolated, ceratosaurus, like, teeth, from, the, tendaguru, beds, of, tanzania, was, listed, by, donald, f, glut, as, a, species, of, allosaurus, is, now, considered, a, dubious, ceratosaurian, related, to, ceratosaurus, l, sulcatus, named, by, marsh, in, 1896, for, a, morrison, theropod, tooth, which, like, l, stechowi, is, now, regarded, as, a, dubious, ceratosaurus, like, ceratosaur, a, tendagurensis, was, named, in, 1925, by, werner, janensch, for, a, partial, shin, mb, r, 3620, found, in, the, kimmeridgian, age, tendaguru, formation, in, mtwara, tanzania, although, tabulated, as, a, tentatively, valid, species, of, allosaurus, in, the, second, edition, of, the, dinosauria, subsequent, studies, place, it, as, indeterminate, beyond, tetanurae, either, a, carcharodontosaurian, or, megalosaurid, although, obscure, it, was, a, large, theropod, possibly, around, 10, metres, 33, ft, long, and, 2, 5, tonnes, 2, 5, long, tons, 2, 8, short, tons, in, weight, kurzanov, and, colleagues, in, 2003, designated, six, teeth, from, siberia, as, allosaurus, sp, meaning, the, authors, found, the, specimens, to, be, most, like, those, of, allosaurus, but, did, not, or, could, not, assign, a, species, to, them, they, were, reclassified, as, an, indeterminate, theropod, also, reports, of, allosaurus, in, shanxi, china, go, back, to, at, least, 1982, these, were, interpreted, as, torvosaurus, remains, in, 2012, an, astragalus, ankle, bone, thought, to, belong, to, a, species, of, allosaurus, was, found, at, cape, paterson, victoria, in, early, cretaceous, beds, in, southeastern, australia, it, was, thought, to, provide, evidence, that, australia, was, a, refugium, for, animals, that, had, gone, extinct, elsewhere, this, identification, was, challenged, by, samuel, welles, who, thought, it, more, resembled, that, of, an, ornithomimid, but, the, original, authors, defended, their, identification, with, fifteen, years, of, new, specimens, and, research, to, look, at, daniel, chure, reexamined, the, bone, and, found, that, it, was, not, allosaurus, but, could, represent, an, allosauroid, similarly, yoichi, azuma, and, phil, currie, in, their, description, of, fukuiraptor, noted, that, the, bone, closely, resembled, that, of, their, new, genus, this, specimen, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, allosaurus, robustus, an, informal, museum, name, it, likely, belonged, to, something, similar, to, australovenator, although, one, study, considered, it, to, belong, to, an, abelisaur, allosaurus, was, a, typical, large, theropod, having, a, massive, skull, on, a, short, neck, a, long, slightly, sloping, tail, and, reduced, forelimbs, allosaurus, fragilis, the, best, known, species, had, an, average, length, of, 8, 5, m, 28, ft, and, mass, of, 1, 7, metric, tons, 1, 9, short, tons, with, the, largest, definitive, allosaurus, specimen, amnh, 680, estimated, at, 9, 7, metres, 32, feet, long, with, an, estimated, weight, of, 2, 3, 2, 7, metric, tons, 2, 5, 3, 0, short, tons, in, his, 1976, monograph, on, allosaurus, james, h, madsen, mentioned, a, range, of, bone, sizes, which, he, interpreted, to, show, a, maximum, length, of, 12, to, 13, m, 39, to, 43, ft, as, with, dinosaurs, in, general, weight, estimates, are, debatable, and, since, 1980, have, ranged, between, 1, 5, metric, tons, 1, 7, short, tons, 1, to, 4, metric, tons, 1, 1, to, 4, 4, short, tons, and, approximately, 1, metric, ton, 1, 1, short, tons, for, modal, adult, weight, not, maximum, john, foster, a, specialist, on, the, morrison, formation, suggests, that, 1, metric, ton, 1, 1, short, tons, is, reasonable, for, large, adults, of, a, fragilis, but, that, 700, kg, 1, 500, lb, is, a, closer, estimate, for, individuals, represented, by, the, average, sized, thigh, bones, he, has, measured, using, the, subadult, specimen, nicknamed, big, al, since, assigned, to, the, species, allosaurus, jimmadseni, researchers, using, computer, modeling, arrived, at, a, best, estimate, of, 1, 5, metric, tons, 1, 7, short, tons, for, the, individual, but, by, varying, parameters, they, found, a, range, from, approximately, 1, 4, metric, tons, 1, 5, short, tons, to, approximately, 2, metric, tons, 2, 2, short, tons, a, separate, computational, project, estimated, the, adaptive, optimum, body, mass, in, allosaurus, to, be, 2, 345, kg, a, europaeus, has, been, measured, up, to, 7, m, 23, ft, in, length, and, 1, metric, ton, 1, 1, short, tons, in, body, mass, several, gigantic, specimens, have, been, attributed, to, allosaurus, but, may, in, fact, belong, to, other, genera, the, closely, related, genus, saurophaganax, omnh, 1708, reached, perhaps, 10, 5, m, 34, ft, in, length, and, its, single, species, has, sometimes, been, included, in, the, genus, allosaurus, as, allosaurus, maximus, though, recent, studies, support, it, as, a, separate, genus, another, potential, specimen, of, allosaurus, once, assigned, to, the, genus, epanterias, amnh, 5767, may, have, measured, 12, 1, metres, 40, feet, in, length, a, more, recent, discovery, is, a, partial, skeleton, from, the, peterson, quarry, in, morrison, rocks, of, new, mexico, this, large, allosaurid, may, be, another, individual, of, saurophaganax, david, k, smith, examining, allosaurus, fossils, by, quarry, found, that, the, cleveland, lloyd, dinosaur, quarry, utah, specimens, are, generally, smaller, than, those, from, como, bluff, wyoming, or, brigham, young, university, s, dry, mesa, quarry, colorado, but, the, shapes, of, the, bones, themselves, did, not, vary, between, the, sites, a, later, study, by, smith, incorporating, garden, park, colorado, and, dinosaur, national, monument, utah, specimens, found, no, justification, for, multiple, species, based, on, skeletal, variation, skull, variation, was, most, common, and, was, gradational, suggesting, individual, variation, was, responsible, further, work, on, size, related, variation, again, found, no, consistent, differences, although, the, dry, mesa, material, tended, to, clump, together, on, the, basis, of, the, astragalus, an, ankle, bone, kenneth, carpenter, using, skull, elements, from, the, cleveland, lloyd, site, found, wide, variation, between, individuals, calling, into, question, previous, species, level, distinctions, based, on, such, features, as, the, shape, of, the, horns, and, the, proposed, differentiation, of, a, jimmadseni, based, on, the, shape, of, the, jugal, a, study, published, by, motani, et, al, in, 2020, suggests, that, allosaurus, was, also, sexually, dimorphic, in, the, width, of, the, femur, s, head, against, its, length, the, skull, and, teeth, of, allosaurus, were, modestly, proportioned, for, a, theropod, of, its, size, paleontologist, gregory, s, paul, gives, a, length, of, 845, mm, 33, 3, in, for, a, skull, belonging, to, an, individual, he, estimates, at, 7, 9, m, 26, ft, long, each, premaxilla, the, bones, that, formed, the, tip, of, the, snout, held, five, teeth, with, d, shaped, cross, sections, and, each, maxilla, the, main, tooth, bearing, bones, in, the, upper, jaw, had, between, 14, and, 17, teeth, the, number, of, teeth, does, not, exactly, correspond, to, the, size, of, the, bone, each, dentary, the, tooth, bearing, bone, of, the, lower, jaw, had, between, 14, and, 17, teeth, with, an, average, count, of, 16, the, teeth, became, shorter, narrower, and, more, curved, toward, the, back, of, the, skull, all, of, the, teeth, had, saw, like, edges, they, were, shed, easily, and, were, replaced, continually, making, them, common, fossils, its, skull, was, light, robust, and, equipped, with, dozens, of, sharp, serrated, teeth, the, skull, had, a, pair, of, horns, above, and, in, front, of, the, eyes, these, horns, were, composed, of, extensions, of, the, lacrimal, bones, and, varied, in, shape, and, size, there, were, also, lower, paired, ridges, running, along, the, top, edges, of, the, nasal, bones, that, led, into, the, horns, the, horns, were, probably, covered, in, a, keratin, sheath, and, may, have, had, a, variety, of, functions, including, acting, as, sunshades, for, the, eyes, being, used, for, display, and, being, used, in, combat, against, other, members, of, the, same, species, although, they, were, fragile, there, was, a, ridge, along, the, back, of, the, skull, roof, for, muscle, attachment, as, is, also, seen, in, tyrannosaurids, inside, the, lacrimal, bones, were, depressions, that, may, have, held, glands, such, as, salt, glands, within, the, maxillae, were, sinuses, that, were, better, developed, than, those, of, more, basal, theropods, such, as, ceratosaurus, and, marshosaurus, they, may, have, been, related, to, the, sense, of, smell, perhaps, holding, something, like, jacobson, s, organs, the, roof, of, the, braincase, was, thin, perhaps, to, improve, thermoregulation, for, the, brain, the, skull, and, lower, jaws, had, joints, that, permitted, motion, within, these, units, in, the, lower, jaws, the, bones, of, the, front, and, back, halves, loosely, articulated, permitting, the, jaws, to, bow, outward, and, increasing, the, animal, s, gape, the, braincase, and, frontals, may, also, have, had, a, joint, allosaurus, had, nine, vertebrae, in, the, neck, 14, in, the, back, and, five, in, the, sacrum, supporting, the, hips, the, number, of, tail, vertebrae, is, unknown, and, varied, with, individual, size, james, madsen, estimated, about, 50, while, gregory, s, paul, considered, that, to, be, too, many, and, suggested, 45, or, less, there, were, hollow, spaces, in, the, neck, and, anterior, back, vertebrae, such, spaces, which, are, also, found, in, modern, theropods, that, is, the, birds, are, interpreted, as, having, held, air, sacs, used, in, respiration, the, rib, cage, was, broad, giving, it, a, barrel, chest, especially, in, comparison, to, less, derived, theropods, like, ceratosaurus, allosaurus, had, gastralia, belly, ribs, but, these, are, not, common, findings, and, they, may, have, ossified, poorly, in, one, published, case, the, gastralia, show, evidence, of, injury, during, life, a, furcula, wishbone, was, also, present, but, has, only, been, recognized, since, 1996, in, some, cases, furculae, were, confused, with, gastralia, the, ilium, the, main, hip, bone, was, massive, and, the, pubic, bone, had, a, prominent, foot, that, may, have, been, used, for, both, muscle, attachment, and, as, a, prop, for, resting, the, body, on, the, ground, madsen, noted, that, in, about, half, of, the, individuals, from, the, cleveland, lloyd, dinosaur, quarry, independent, of, size, the, pubes, had, not, fused, to, each, other, at, their, foot, ends, he, suggested, that, this, was, a, sexual, characteristic, with, females, lacking, fused, bones, to, make, egg, laying, easier, this, proposal, has, not, attracted, further, attention, however, the, forelimbs, of, allosaurus, were, short, in, comparison, to, the, hindlimbs, only, about, 35, the, length, of, the, hindlimbs, in, adults, and, had, three, fingers, per, hand, tipped, with, large, strongly, curved, and, pointed, claws, the, arms, were, powerful, and, the, forearm, was, somewhat, shorter, than, the, upper, arm, 1, 1, 2, ulna, humerus, ratio, the, wrist, had, a, version, of, the, semilunate, carpal, also, found, in, more, derived, theropods, like, maniraptorans, of, the, three, fingers, the, innermost, or, thumb, was, the, largest, and, diverged, from, the, others, the, phalangeal, formula, is, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, meaning, that, the, innermost, finger, phalange, has, two, bones, the, next, has, three, and, the, third, finger, has, four, the, legs, were, not, as, long, or, suited, for, speed, as, those, of, tyrannosaurids, and, the, claws, of, the, toes, were, less, developed, and, more, hoof, like, than, those, of, earlier, theropods, each, foot, had, three, weight, bearing, toes, and, an, inner, dewclaw, which, madsen, suggested, could, have, been, used, for, grasping, in, juveniles, there, was, also, what, is, interpreted, as, the, splint, like, remnant, of, a, fifth, outermost, metatarsal, perhaps, used, as, a, lever, between, the, achilles, tendon, and, foot, skin, impressions, from, allosaurus, have, been, described, one, impression, from, a, juvenile, specimen, measures, 30, cm, and, is, associated, with, the, anterior, dorsal, ribs, pectoral, region, the, impression, shows, small, scales, measuring, 1, 3, mm, in, diameter, a, skin, impression, from, the, big, al, two, specimen, associated, with, the, base, of, the, tail, measures, 20, cm, x, 20, cm, and, shows, large, scales, measuring, up, to, 2, cm, in, diameter, however, it, has, been, noted, that, these, scales, are, more, similar, to, those, of, sauropods, and, due, to, the, presence, of, non, theropod, remains, associated, with, the, tail, of, big, al, two, there, is, a, possibility, that, this, skin, impression, is, not, from, allosaurus, another, allosaurus, fossil, features, a, skin, impression, from, the, mandible, showing, scales, measuring, 1, 2, mm, in, diameter, the, same, fossil, also, preserves, skin, impressions, from, the, ventral, side, of, the, neck, showing, broad, scutes, a, small, skin, impression, from, an, allosaurus, skull, has, been, reported, but, never, described, allosaurus, was, an, allosaurid, a, member, of, a, family, of, large, theropods, within, the, larger, group, carnosauria, the, family, name, allosauridae, was, created, for, this, genus, in, 1878, by, othniel, charles, marsh, but, the, term, was, largely, unused, until, the, 1970s, in, favor, of, megalosauridae, another, family, of, large, theropods, that, eventually, became, a, wastebasket, taxon, this, along, with, the, use, of, antrodemus, for, allosaurus, during, the, same, period, is, a, point, that, needs, to, be, remembered, when, searching, for, information, on, allosaurus, in, publications, that, predate, james, madsen, s, 1976, monograph, major, publications, using, the, name, megalosauridae, instead, of, allosauridae, include, gilmore, 1920, von, huene, 1926, romer, 1956, and, 1966, steel, 1970, and, walker, 1964, following, the, publication, of, madsen, s, influential, monograph, allosauridae, became, the, preferred, family, assignment, but, it, too, was, not, strongly, defined, semi, technical, works, used, allosauridae, for, a, variety, of, large, theropods, usually, those, that, were, larger, and, better, known, than, megalosaurids, typical, theropods, that, were, thought, to, be, related, to, allosaurus, included, indosaurus, piatnitzkysaurus, piveteausaurus, yangchuanosaurus, acrocanthosaurus, chilantaisaurus, compsosuchus, stokesosaurus, and, szechuanosaurus, given, modern, knowledge, of, theropod, diversity, and, the, advent, of, cladistic, study, of, evolutionary, relationships, none, of, these, theropods, is, now, recognized, as, an, allosaurid, although, several, like, acrocanthosaurus, and, yangchuanosaurus, are, members, of, closely, related, families, below, is, a, cladogram, based, on, the, analysis, of, benson, et, al, in, 2010, sinraptoridae, allosaurus, neovenator, fukuiraptor, megaraptor, eocarcharia, acrocanthosaurus, shaochilong, tyrannotitan, carcharodontosaurus, giganotosaurus, mapusaurus, allosauridae, is, one, of, four, families, in, allosauroidea, the, other, three, are, neovenatoridae, carcharodontosauridae, and, sinraptoridae, allosauridae, has, at, times, been, proposed, as, ancestral, to, the, tyrannosauridae, which, would, make, it, paraphyletic, one, example, being, gregory, s, paul, s, predatory, dinosaurs, of, the, world, but, this, has, been, rejected, with, tyrannosaurids, identified, as, members, of, a, separate, branch, of, theropods, the, coelurosauria, allosauridae, is, the, smallest, of, the, carnosaur, families, with, only, saurophaganax, and, a, currently, unnamed, french, allosauroid, accepted, as, possible, valid, genera, besides, allosaurus, in, the, most, recent, review, another, genus, epanterias, is, a, potential, valid, member, but, it, and, saurophaganax, may, turn, out, to, be, large, examples, of, allosaurus, recent, reviews, have, kept, the, genus, saurophaganax, and, included, epanterias, with, allosaurus, the, wealth, of, allosaurus, fossils, from, nearly, all, ages, of, individuals, allows, scientists, to, study, how, the, animal, grew, and, how, long, its, lifespan, may, have, been, remains, may, reach, as, far, back, in, the, lifespan, as, eggs, crushed, eggs, from, colorado, have, been, suggested, as, those, of, allosaurus, based, on, histological, analysis, of, limb, bones, bone, deposition, appears, to, stop, at, around, 22, to, 28, years, which, is, comparable, to, that, of, other, large, theropods, like, tyrannosaurus, from, the, same, analysis, its, maximum, growth, appears, to, have, been, at, age, 15, with, an, estimated, growth, rate, of, about, 150, kilograms, 330, lb, per, year, medullary, bone, tissue, endosteally, derived, ephemeral, mineralization, located, inside, the, medulla, of, the, long, bones, in, gravid, female, birds, has, been, reported, in, at, least, one, allosaurus, specimen, a, shin, bone, from, the, cleveland, lloyd, quarry, today, this, bone, tissue, is, only, formed, in, female, birds, that, are, laying, eggs, as, it, is, used, to, supply, calcium, to, shells, its, presence, in, the, allosaurus, individual, has, been, used, to, establish, sex, and, show, it, had, reached, reproductive, age, however, other, studies, have, called, into, question, some, cases, of, medullary, bone, in, dinosaurs, including, this, allosaurus, individual, data, from, extant, birds, suggested, that, the, medullary, bone, in, this, allosaurus, individual, may, have, been, the, result, of, a, bone, pathology, instead, however, with, the, confirmation, of, medullary, tissue, indicating, sex, in, a, specimen, of, tyrannosaurus, it, may, be, possible, to, ascertain, whether, or, not, the, allosaurus, in, question, was, indeed, female, the, discovery, of, a, juvenile, specimen, with, a, nearly, complete, hindlimb, shows, that, the, legs, were, relatively, longer, in, juveniles, and, the, lower, segments, of, the, leg, shin, and, foot, were, relatively, longer, than, the, thigh, these, differences, suggest, that, younger, allosaurus, were, faster, and, had, different, hunting, strategies, than, adults, perhaps, chasing, small, prey, as, juveniles, then, becoming, ambush, hunters, of, large, prey, upon, adulthood, the, thigh, bone, became, thicker, and, wider, during, growth, and, the, cross, section, less, circular, as, muscle, attachments, shifted, muscles, became, shorter, and, the, growth, of, the, leg, slowed, these, changes, imply, that, juvenile, legs, has, less, predictable, stresses, compared, with, adults, which, would, have, moved, with, more, regular, forward, progression, conversely, the, skull, bones, appear, to, have, generally, grown, isometrically, increasing, in, size, without, changing, in, proportion, most, paleontologists, accept, allosaurus, as, an, active, predator, of, large, animals, there, is, dramatic, evidence, for, allosaur, attacks, on, stegosaurus, including, an, allosaurus, tail, vertebra, with, a, partially, healed, puncture, wound, that, fits, a, stegosaurus, tail, spike, and, a, stegosaurus, neck, plate, with, a, u, shaped, wound, that, correlates, well, with, an, allosaurus, snout, sauropods, seem, to, be, likely, candidates, as, both, live, prey, and, as, objects, of, scavenging, based, on, the, presence, of, scrapings, on, sauropod, bones, fitting, allosaur, teeth, well, and, the, presence, of, shed, allosaur, teeth, with, sauropod, bones, however, as, gregory, paul, noted, in, 1988, allosaurus, was, probably, not, a, predator, of, fully, grown, sauropods, unless, it, hunted, in, packs, as, it, had, a, modestly, sized, skull, and, relatively, small, teeth, and, was, greatly, outweighed, by, contemporaneous, sauropods, another, possibility, is, that, it, preferred, to, hunt, juveniles, instead, of, fully, grown, adults, research, in, the, 1990s, and, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, may, have, found, other, solutions, to, this, question, robert, t, bakker, comparing, allosaurus, to, cenozoic, saber, toothed, carnivorous, mammals, found, similar, adaptations, such, as, a, reduction, of, jaw, muscles, and, increase, in, neck, muscles, and, the, ability, to, open, the, jaws, extremely, wide, although, allosaurus, did, not, have, saber, teeth, bakker, suggested, another, mode, of, attack, that, would, have, used, such, neck, and, jaw, adaptations, the, short, teeth, in, effect, became, small, serrations, on, a, saw, like, cutting, edge, running, the, length, of, the, upper, jaw, which, would, have, been, driven, into, prey, this, type, of, jaw, would, permit, slashing, attacks, against, much, larger, prey, with, the, goal, of, weakening, the, victim, similar, conclusions, were, drawn, by, another, study, using, finite, element, analysis, on, an, allosaurus, skull, according, to, their, biomechanical, analysis, the, skull, was, very, strong, but, had, a, relatively, small, bite, force, by, using, jaw, muscles, only, it, could, produce, a, bite, force, of, 805, to, 8, 724, n, but, the, skull, could, withstand, nearly, 55, 500, n, of, vertical, force, against, the, tooth, row, the, authors, suggested, that, allosaurus, used, its, skull, like, a, machete, against, prey, attacking, open, mouthed, slashing, flesh, with, its, teeth, and, tearing, it, away, without, splintering, bones, unlike, tyrannosaurus, which, is, thought, to, have, been, capable, of, damaging, bones, they, also, suggested, that, the, architecture, of, the, skull, could, have, permitted, the, use, of, different, strategies, against, different, prey, the, skull, was, light, enough, to, allow, attacks, on, smaller, and, more, agile, ornithopods, but, strong, enough, for, high, impact, ambush, attacks, against, larger, prey, like, stegosaurids, and, sauropods, their, interpretations, were, challenged, by, other, researchers, who, found, no, modern, analogs, to, a, hatchet, attack, and, considered, it, more, likely, that, the, skull, was, strong, to, compensate, for, its, open, construction, when, absorbing, the, stresses, from, struggling, prey, the, original, authors, noted, that, allosaurus, itself, has, no, modern, equivalent, that, the, tooth, row, is, well, suited, to, such, an, attack, and, that, articulations, in, the, skull, cited, by, their, detractors, as, problematic, actually, helped, protect, the, palate, and, lessen, stress, another, possibility, for, handling, large, prey, is, that, theropods, like, allosaurus, were, flesh, grazers, which, could, take, bites, of, flesh, out, of, living, sauropods, that, were, sufficient, to, sustain, the, predator, so, it, would, not, have, needed, to, expend, the, effort, to, kill, the, prey, outright, this, strategy, would, also, potentially, have, allowed, the, prey, to, recover, and, be, fed, upon, in, a, similar, way, later, an, additional, suggestion, notes, that, ornithopods, were, the, most, common, available, dinosaurian, prey, and, that, allosaurus, may, have, subdued, them, by, using, an, attack, similar, to, that, of, modern, big, cats, grasping, the, prey, with, their, forelimbs, and, then, making, multiple, bites, on, the, throat, to, crush, the, trachea, this, is, compatible, with, other, evidence, that, the, forelimbs, were, strong, and, capable, of, restraining, prey, studies, done, by, stephen, lautenschager, et, al, from, the, university, of, bristol, also, indicate, allosaurus, could, open, its, jaws, quite, wide, and, sustain, considerable, muscle, force, when, compared, with, tyrannosaurus, and, the, therizinosaurid, erlikosaurus, in, the, same, study, it, was, found, that, allosaurus, had, a, wider, gape, than, either, the, animal, was, capable, of, opening, its, jaws, to, a, 92, degree, angle, at, maximum, the, findings, also, indicate, that, large, carnivorous, dinosaurs, like, modern, carnivores, had, wider, jaw, gapes, than, herbivores, a, biomechanical, study, published, in, 2013, by, eric, snively, and, colleagues, found, that, allosaurus, had, an, unusually, low, attachment, point, on, the, skull, for, the, longissimus, capitis, superficialis, neck, muscle, compared, to, other, theropods, such, as, tyrannosaurus, this, would, have, allowed, the, animal, to, make, rapid, and, forceful, vertical, movements, with, the, skull, the, authors, found, that, vertical, strikes, as, proposed, by, bakker, and, rayfield, are, consistent, with, the, animal, s, capabilities, they, also, found, that, the, animal, probably, processed, carcasses, by, vertical, movements, in, a, similar, manner, to, falcons, such, as, kestrels, the, animal, could, have, gripped, prey, with, the, skull, and, feet, then, pulled, back, and, up, to, remove, flesh, this, differs, from, the, prey, handling, envisioned, for, tyrannosaurids, which, probably, tore, flesh, with, lateral, shakes, of, the, skull, similar, to, crocodilians, in, addition, allosaurus, was, able, to, move, its, head, and, neck, around, relatively, rapidly, and, with, considerable, control, at, the, cost, of, power, other, aspects, of, feeding, include, the, eyes, arms, and, legs, the, shape, of, the, skull, of, allosaurus, limited, potential, binocular, vision, to, 20, of, width, slightly, less, than, that, of, modern, crocodilians, as, with, crocodilians, this, may, have, been, enough, to, judge, prey, distance, and, time, attacks, the, arms, compared, with, those, of, other, theropods, were, suited, for, both, grasping, prey, at, a, distance, or, clutching, it, close, and, the, articulation, of, the, claws, suggests, that, they, could, have, been, used, to, hook, things, finally, the, top, speed, of, allosaurus, has, been, estimated, at, 30, 55, kilometres, 19, 34, mi, per, hour, a, paper, on, the, cranio, dental, morphology, of, allosaurus, and, how, it, worked, has, deemed, the, hatchet, jaw, attack, unlikely, reinterpreting, the, unusually, wide, gape, as, an, adaptation, to, allow, allosaurus, to, deliver, a, muscle, driven, bite, to, large, prey, with, the, weaker, jaw, muscles, being, a, trade, off, to, allow, for, the, widened, gape, sauropod, carrion, may, also, have, been, important, to, large, theropods, in, the, morrison, formation, forensic, techniques, indicate, that, sauropod, carcasses, were, targeted, by, allosaurus, at, all, stages, of, decomposition, indicating, that, late, stage, decay, pathogens, were, not, a, significant, deterrent, a, survey, of, sauropod, bones, from, the, morrison, formation, also, reported, widespread, bite, marks, on, sauropod, bones, in, low, economy, regions, which, suggests, that, large, theropods, scavenged, large, sauropods, when, available, with, the, scarcity, of, such, bite, marks, on, the, remains, of, smaller, bones, being, potentially, attributable, to, much, more, complete, consumption, of, smaller, or, adolescent, sauropods, and, on, ornithischians, which, would, have, been, more, commonly, taken, as, live, prey, a, single, dead, adult, barosaurus, or, brachiosaurus, would, have, had, enough, calories, to, sustain, multiple, large, theropods, for, weeks, or, months, though, the, vast, majority, of, the, morrison, s, sauropod, fossil, record, consisted, of, much, smaller, bodied, taxa, such, as, camarasaurus, lentus, or, diplodocus, it, has, also, been, argued, that, disabled, individuals, such, as, big, al, and, big, al, ii, were, physically, incapable, of, hunting, due, to, their, numerous, injuries, but, were, able, to, survive, nonetheless, as, scavengers, of, giant, sauropod, falls, interestingly, a, recent, review, of, paleopathologies, in, theropods, may, support, this, conclusion, the, researchers, found, a, positive, association, between, allosaurids, and, fractures, to, the, appendicular, skeleton, while, tyrannosaurs, had, a, statistically, negative, association, with, these, types, of, injuries, the, fact, that, allosaurs, were, more, likely, to, survive, and, heal, even, when, severe, fractures, limited, their, locomotion, abilities, can, be, explained, in, part, by, different, resource, accessibility, paradigms, for, the, two, groups, as, allosauroids, generally, lived, in, sauropod, inhabited, ecosystems, some, of, which, including, the, morrison, have, been, interpreted, as, arid, and, highly, water, stressed, environments, however, the, water, stressed, nature, of, the, morrison, has, been, heavily, criticized, in, several, more, recent, works, on, the, basis, of, fossil, evidence, for, the, presence, of, extensive, forest, cover, and, aquatic, ecosystems, it, has, been, speculated, since, the, 1970s, that, allosaurus, preyed, on, sauropods, and, other, large, dinosaurs, by, hunting, in, groups, such, a, depiction, is, common, in, semitechnical, and, popular, dinosaur, literature, robert, t, bakker, has, extended, social, behavior, to, parental, care, and, has, interpreted, shed, allosaur, teeth, and, chewed, bones, of, large, prey, animals, as, evidence, that, adult, allosaurs, brought, food, to, lairs, for, their, young, to, eat, until, they, were, grown, and, prevented, other, carnivores, from, scavenging, on, the, food, however, there, is, actually, little, evidence, of, gregarious, behavior, in, theropods, and, social, interactions, with, members, of, the, same, species, would, have, included, antagonistic, encounters, as, shown, by, injuries, to, gastralia, and, bite, wounds, to, skulls, the, pathologic, lower, jaw, named, labrosaurus, ferox, is, one, such, possible, example, such, head, biting, may, have, been, a, way, to, establish, dominance, in, a, pack, or, to, settle, territorial, disputes, although, allosaurus, may, have, hunted, in, packs, it, has, been, argued, that, allosaurus, and, other, theropods, had, largely, aggressive, interactions, instead, of, cooperative, interactions, with, other, members, of, their, own, species, the, study, in, question, noted, that, cooperative, hunting, of, prey, much, larger, than, an, individual, predator, as, is, commonly, inferred, for, theropod, dinosaurs, is, rare, among, vertebrates, in, general, and, modern, diapsid, carnivores, including, lizards, crocodiles, and, birds, rarely, cooperate, to, hunt, in, such, a, way, instead, they, are, typically, territorial, and, will, kill, and, cannibalize, intruders, of, the, same, species, and, will, also, do, the, same, to, smaller, individuals, that, attempt, to, eat, before, they, do, when, aggregated, at, feeding, sites, according, to, this, interpretation, the, accumulation, of, remains, of, multiple, allosaurus, individuals, at, the, same, site, e, g, in, the, cleveland, lloyd, quarry, are, not, due, to, pack, hunting, but, to, the, fact, that, allosaurus, individuals, were, drawn, together, to, feed, on, other, disabled, or, dead, allosaurs, and, were, sometimes, killed, in, the, process, this, could, explain, the, high, proportion, of, juvenile, and, subadult, allosaurs, present, as, juveniles, and, subadults, are, disproportionally, killed, at, modern, group, feeding, sites, of, animals, like, crocodiles, and, komodo, dragons, the, same, interpretation, applies, to, bakker, s, lair, sites, there, is, some, evidence, for, cannibalism, in, allosaurus, including, allosaurus, shed, teeth, found, among, rib, fragments, possible, tooth, marks, on, a, shoulder, blade, and, cannibalized, allosaur, skeletons, among, the, bones, at, bakker, s, lair, sites, the, brain, of, allosaurus, as, interpreted, from, spiral, ct, scanning, of, an, endocast, was, more, consistent, with, crocodilian, brains, than, those, of, the, other, living, archosaurs, birds, the, structure, of, the, vestibular, apparatus, indicates, that, the, skull, was, held, nearly, horizontal, as, opposed, to, strongly, tipped, up, or, down, the, structure, of, the, inner, ear, was, like, that, of, a, crocodilian, indicating, that, allosaurus, was, more, adapted, to, hear, lower, frequencies, and, would, have, had, difficulty, hearing, subtle, sounds, the, olfactory, bulbs, were, large, and, well, suited, for, detecting, odors, but, were, typical, for, an, animal, of, its, size, in, 2001, bruce, rothschild, and, others, published, a, study, examining, evidence, for, stress, fractures, and, tendon, avulsions, in, theropod, dinosaurs, and, the, implications, for, their, behavior, since, stress, fractures, are, caused, by, repeated, trauma, rather, than, singular, events, they, are, more, likely, to, be, caused, by, the, behavior, of, the, animal, than, other, kinds, of, injury, stress, fractures, and, tendon, avulsions, occurring, in, the, forelimb, have, special, behavioral, significance, since, while, injuries, to, the, feet, could, be, caused, by, running, or, migration, resistant, prey, items, are, the, most, probable, source, of, injuries, to, the, hand, allosaurus, was, one, of, only, two, theropods, examined, in, the, study, to, exhibit, a, tendon, avulsion, and, in, both, cases, the, avulsion, occurred, on, the, forelimb, when, the, researchers, looked, for, stress, fractures, they, found, that, allosaurus, had, a, significantly, greater, number, of, stress, fractures, than, albertosaurus, ornithomimus, or, archaeornithomimus, of, the, 47, hand, bones, the, researchers, studied, three, were, found, to, contain, stress, fractures, of, the, feet, 281, bones, were, studied, and, 17, were, found, to, have, stress, fractures, the, stress, fractures, in, the, foot, bones, were, distributed, to, the, proximal, phalanges, and, occurred, across, all, three, weight, bearing, toes, in, statistically, indistinguishable, numbers, since, the, lower, end, of, the, third, metatarsal, would, have, contacted, the, ground, first, while, an, allosaur, was, running, it, would, have, borne, the, most, stress, if, the, allosaurs, stress, fractures, were, caused, by, damage, accumulating, while, walking, or, running, this, bone, should, have, experience, more, stress, fractures, than, the, others, the, lack, of, such, a, bias, in, the, examined, allosaurus, fossils, indicates, an, origin, for, the, stress, fractures, from, a, source, other, than, running, the, authors, conclude, that, these, fractures, occurred, during, interaction, with, prey, like, an, allosaur, trying, to, hold, struggling, prey, with, its, feet, the, abundance, of, stress, fractures, and, avulsion, injuries, in, allosaurus, provide, evidence, for, very, active, predation, based, rather, than, scavenging, diets, the, left, scapula, and, fibula, of, an, allosaurus, fragilis, specimen, cataloged, as, usnm, 4734, are, both, pathological, both, probably, due, to, healed, fractures, the, specimen, usnm, 8367, preserved, several, pathological, gastralia, which, preserve, evidence, of, healed, fractures, near, their, middle, some, of, the, fractures, were, poorly, healed, and, formed, pseudoarthroses, a, specimen, with, a, fractured, rib, was, recovered, from, the, cleveland, lloyd, quarry, another, specimen, had, fractured, ribs, and, fused, vertebrae, near, the, end, of, the, tail, an, apparent, subadult, male, allosaurus, fragilis, was, reported, to, have, extensive, pathologies, with, a, total, of, fourteen, separate, injuries, the, specimen, mor, 693, had, pathologies, on, five, ribs, the, sixth, neck, vertebra, the, third, eighth, and, thirteenth, back, vertebrae, the, second, tail, vertebra, and, its, chevron, the, gastralia, right, scapula, manual, phalanx, i, left, ilium, metatarsals, iii, and, v, the, first, phalanx, of, the, third, toe, and, the, third, phalanx, of, the, second, the, ilium, had, a, large, hole, caused, by, a, blow, from, above, the, near, end, of, the, first, phalanx, of, the, third, toe, was, afflicted, by, an, involucrum, additionally, a, subadult, allosaurus, individual, that, suffered, from, spondyloarthropathy, has, been, discovered, in, dana, quarry, in, wyoming, this, finding, represents, the, first, known, fossil, evidence, of, spondyloarthropathy, occurring, in, a, theropod, other, pathologies, reported, in, allosaurus, include, allosaurus, was, the, most, common, large, theropod, in, the, vast, tract, of, western, american, fossil, bearing, rock, known, as, the, morrison, formation, accounting, for, 70, to, 75, of, theropod, specimens, and, as, such, was, at, the, top, trophic, level, of, the, morrison, food, chain, the, morrison, formation, is, interpreted, as, a, semiarid, environment, with, distinct, wet, and, dry, seasons, and, flat, floodplains, vegetation, varied, from, river, lining, forests, of, conifers, tree, ferns, and, ferns, gallery, forests, to, fern, savannas, with, occasional, trees, such, as, the, araucaria, like, conifer, brachyphyllum, the, morrison, formation, has, been, a, rich, fossil, hunting, ground, the, flora, of, the, period, has, been, revealed, by, fossils, of, green, algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and, several, families, of, conifers, animal, fossils, discovered, include, bivalves, snails, ray, finned, fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial, and, aquatic, crocodylomorphs, several, species, of, pterosaur, numerous, dinosaur, species, and, early, mammals, such, as, docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and, triconodonts, dinosaurs, known, from, the, morrison, include, the, theropods, ceratosaurus, ornitholestes, tanycolagreus, and, torvosaurus, the, sauropods, haplocanthosaurus, camarasaurus, cathetosaurus, brachiosaurus, suuwassea, apatosaurus, brontosaurus, barosaurus, diplodocus, supersaurus, amphicoelias, and, maraapunisaurus, and, the, ornithischians, camptosaurus, dryosaurus, and, stegosaurus, allosaurus, is, commonly, found, at, the, same, sites, as, apatosaurus, camarasaurus, diplodocus, and, stegosaurus, the, late, jurassic, formations, of, portugal, where, allosaurus, is, present, are, interpreted, as, having, been, similar, to, the, morrison, but, with, a, stronger, marine, influence, many, of, the, dinosaurs, of, the, morrison, formation, are, the, same, genera, as, those, seen, in, portuguese, rocks, mainly, allosaurus, ceratosaurus, torvosaurus, and, stegosaurus, or, have, a, close, counterpart, brachiosaurus, and, lusotitan, camptosaurus, and, draconyx, allosaurus, coexisted, with, fellow, large, theropods, ceratosaurus, and, torvosaurus, in, both, the, united, states, and, portugal, the, three, appear, to, have, had, different, ecological, niches, based, on, anatomy, and, the, location, of, fossils, ceratosaurus, and, torvosaurus, may, have, preferred, to, be, active, around, waterways, and, had, lower, thinner, bodies, that, would, have, given, them, an, advantage, in, forest, and, underbrush, terrains, whereas, allosaurus, was, more, compact, with, longer, legs, faster, but, less, maneuverable, and, seems, to, have, preferred, dry, floodplains, ceratosaurus, better, known, than, torvosaurus, differed, noticeably, from, allosaurus, in, functional, anatomy, by, having, a, taller, narrower, skull, with, large, broad, teeth, allosaurus, was, itself, a, potential, food, item, to, other, carnivores, as, illustrated, by, an, allosaurus, pubic, foot, marked, by, the, teeth, of, another, theropod, probably, ceratosaurus, or, torvosaurus, the, location, of, the, bone, in, the, body, along, the, bottom, margin, of, the, torso, and, partially, shielded, by, the, legs, and, the, fact, that, it, was, among, the, most, massive, in, the, skeleton, indicates, that, the, allosaurus, was, being, scavenged, a, bone, assemblage, in, the, upper, jurassic, mygatt, moore, quarry, preserves, an, unusually, high, occurrence, of, theropod, bite, marks, most, of, which, can, be, attributed, to, allosaurus, and, ceratosaurus, while, others, could, have, been, made, by, saurophaganax, or, torvosaurus, given, the, size, of, the, striations, while, the, position, of, the, bite, marks, on, the, herbivorous, dinosaurs, is, consistent, with, predation, or, early, access, to, remains, bite, marks, found, on, allosaurus, material, suggest, scavenging, either, from, the, other, theropods, or, from, another, allosaurus, the, unusually, high, concentration, of, theropod, bite, marks, compared, to, other, assemblages, could, be, explained, either, by, a, more, complete, utilization, of, resources, during, a, dry, season, by, theropods, or, by, a, collecting, bias, in, other, localities
