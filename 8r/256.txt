carnivorous, plants, are, plants, that, derive, some, or, most, of, their, nutrients, from, trapping, and, consuming, animals, or, protozoans, typically, insects, and, other, arthropods, and, occasionally, small, mammals, and, birds, they, still, generate, all, of, their, energy, from, photosynthesis, they, have, adapted, to, grow, in, waterlogged, sunny, places, where, the, soil, is, thin, or, poor, in, nutrients, especially, nitrogen, such, as, acidic, bogs, they, can, be, found, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, as, well, as, many, pacific, islands, in, 1875, charles, darwin, published, insectivorous, plants, the, first, treatise, to, recognize, the, significance, of, carnivory, in, plants, describing, years, of, painstaking, research, true, carnivory, is, believed, to, have, evolved, independently, at, least, 12, times, in, five, different, orders, of, flowering, plants, and, is, represented, by, more, than, a, dozen, genera, this, classification, includes, at, least, 583, species, that, attract, trap, and, kill, prey, absorbing, the, resulting, available, nutrients, venus, flytraps, dionaea, muscipula, pitcher, plants, and, bladderworts, utricularia, spp, can, be, seen, as, exemplars, of, key, traits, genetically, associated, with, carnivory, trap, leaf, development, prey, digestion, and, nutrient, absorption, the, number, of, known, species, has, increased, by, approximately, 3, species, per, year, since, the, year, 2000, additionally, over, 300, protocarnivorous, plant, species, in, several, genera, show, some, but, not, all, of, these, characteristics, a, 2020, assessment, has, found, that, roughly, one, quarter, are, threatened, with, extinction, from, human, actions, plants, are, considered, carnivorous, if, they, have, these, five, traits, other, traits, may, include, the, attraction, and, retention, of, prey, five, basic, trapping, mechanisms, are, found, in, carnivorous, plants, these, traps, may, be, active, or, passive, depending, on, whether, movement, aids, the, capture, of, prey, for, example, triphyophyllum, is, a, passive, flypaper, that, secretes, mucilage, but, whose, leaves, do, not, grow, or, move, in, response, to, prey, capture, meanwhile, sundews, are, active, flypaper, traps, whose, leaves, undergo, rapid, acid, growth, which, is, an, expansion, of, individual, cells, as, opposed, to, cell, division, the, rapid, acid, growth, allows, the, sundews, tentacles, to, bend, aiding, in, the, retention, and, digestion, of, prey, characterised, by, an, internal, chamber, pitfall, traps, are, thought, to, have, evolved, independently, at, least, six, times, this, particular, adaptation, is, found, within, the, families, sarraceniaceae, darlingtonia, heliamphora, sarracenia, nepenthaceae, nepenthes, and, cephalotaceae, cephalotus, within, the, family, bromeliaceae, pitcher, morphology, and, carnivory, evolved, twice, brocchinia, and, catopsis, because, these, families, do, not, share, a, common, ancestor, who, also, had, pitfall, trap, morphology, carnivorous, pitchers, are, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, a, passive, trap, pitfall, traps, attract, prey, with, nectar, bribes, secreted, by, the, peristome, and, bright, flower, like, anthocyanin, patterning, within, the, pitcher, the, linings, of, most, pitcher, plants, are, covered, in, a, loose, coating, of, waxy, flakes, which, are, slippery, for, insects, causing, them, to, fall, into, the, pitcher, once, within, the, pitcher, structure, digestive, enzymes, or, mutualistic, species, break, down, the, prey, into, an, absorbable, form, for, the, plant, water, can, become, trapped, within, the, pitcher, making, a, habitat, for, other, flora, and, fauna, this, type, of, water, body, is, called, a, phytotelma, the, simplest, pitcher, plants, are, probably, those, of, heliamphora, the, marsh, pitcher, plant, in, this, genus, the, traps, are, clearly, derived, from, a, simple, rolled, leaf, whose, margins, have, sealed, together, these, plants, live, in, areas, of, high, rainfall, in, south, america, such, as, mount, roraima, and, consequently, have, a, problem, ensuring, their, pitchers, do, not, overflow, to, counteract, this, problem, natural, selection, has, favoured, the, evolution, of, an, overflow, similar, to, that, of, a, bathroom, sink, a, small, gap, in, the, zipped, up, leaf, margins, allows, excess, water, to, flow, out, of, the, pitcher, in, the, genus, sarracenia, the, problem, of, pitcher, overflow, is, solved, by, an, operculum, which, is, essentially, a, flared, leaflet, that, covers, the, opening, of, the, rolled, leaf, tube, and, protects, it, from, rain, possibly, because, of, this, improved, waterproofing, sarracenia, species, secrete, enzymes, such, as, proteases, and, phosphatases, into, the, digestive, fluid, at, the, bottom, of, the, pitcher, in, at, least, one, species, sarracenia, flava, the, nectar, bribe, is, laced, with, coniine, a, toxic, alkaloid, also, found, in, hemlock, which, probably, increases, the, efficiency, of, the, traps, by, intoxicating, prey, most, heliamphora, rely, on, bacterial, digestion, alone, with, the, exception, of, a, single, species, heliamphora, tatei, which, does, produce, digestive, enzymes, the, enzymes, digest, the, proteins, and, nucleic, acids, in, the, prey, releasing, amino, acids, and, phosphate, ions, which, the, plant, absorbs, darlingtonia, californica, the, cobra, plant, possesses, an, adaptation, also, found, in, sarracenia, psittacina, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, sarracenia, minor, the, operculum, is, balloon, like, and, almost, seals, the, opening, to, the, tube, this, balloon, like, chamber, is, pitted, with, areolae, chlorophyll, free, patches, through, which, light, can, penetrate, insects, mostly, ants, enter, the, chamber, via, the, opening, underneath, the, balloon, once, inside, they, tire, themselves, trying, to, escape, from, these, false, exits, until, they, eventually, fall, into, the, tube, prey, access, is, increased, by, the, fish, tails, outgrowths, of, the, operculum, that, give, the, plant, its, name, some, seedling, sarracenia, species, also, have, long, overhanging, opercular, outgrowths, darlingtonia, may, therefore, represent, an, example, of, neoteny, the, second, major, group, of, pitcher, plants, are, the, monkey, cups, or, tropical, pitcher, plants, of, the, genus, nepenthes, in, the, hundred, or, so, species, of, this, genus, the, pitcher, is, borne, at, the, end, of, a, tendril, which, grows, as, an, extension, to, the, midrib, of, the, leaf, most, species, catch, insects, although, the, larger, ones, such, as, nepenthes, rajah, also, occasionally, take, small, mammals, and, reptiles, nepenthes, bicalcarata, possesses, two, sharp, thorns, that, project, from, the, base, of, the, operculum, over, the, entrance, to, the, pitcher, these, likely, serve, to, lure, insects, into, a, precarious, position, over, the, pitcher, mouth, where, they, may, lose, their, footing, and, fall, into, the, fluid, within, the, pitfall, trap, has, evolved, independently, in, at, least, two, other, groups, the, albany, pitcher, plant, cephalotus, follicularis, is, a, small, pitcher, plant, from, western, australia, with, moccasin, like, pitchers, the, rim, of, its, pitcher, s, opening, the, peristome, is, particularly, pronounced, both, secrete, nectar, and, provides, a, thorny, overhang, to, the, opening, preventing, trapped, insects, from, climbing, out, the, final, carnivore, with, a, pitfall, like, trap, is, the, bromeliad, brocchinia, reducta, like, most, relatives, of, the, pineapple, the, tightly, packed, waxy, leaf, bases, of, the, strap, like, leaves, of, this, species, form, an, urn, in, most, bromeliads, water, collects, readily, in, this, urn, and, may, provide, habitats, for, frogs, insects, and, more, useful, for, the, plant, diazotrophic, nitrogen, fixing, bacteria, in, brocchinia, the, urn, is, a, specialised, insect, trap, with, a, loose, waxy, lining, and, a, population, of, digestive, bacteria, the, flypaper, trap, utilises, sticky, mucilage, or, glue, the, leaf, of, flypaper, traps, is, studded, with, mucilage, secreting, glands, which, may, be, short, like, those, of, the, butterworts, or, long, and, mobile, like, those, of, many, sundews, flypapers, have, evolved, independently, at, least, five, times, there, is, evidence, that, some, clades, of, flypaper, traps, have, evolved, from, morphologically, more, complex, traps, such, as, pitchers, in, the, genus, pinguicula, the, mucilage, glands, are, quite, short, sessile, and, the, leaf, while, shiny, giving, the, genus, its, common, name, of, butterwort, does, not, appear, carnivorous, however, this, belies, the, fact, that, the, leaf, is, an, extremely, effective, trap, of, small, flying, insects, such, as, fungus, gnats, and, its, surface, responds, to, prey, by, relatively, rapid, growth, this, thigmotropic, growth, may, involve, rolling, of, the, leaf, blade, to, prevent, rain, from, splashing, the, prey, off, the, leaf, surface, or, dishing, of, the, surface, under, the, prey, to, form, a, shallow, digestive, pit, the, sundew, genus, drosera, consists, of, over, 100, species, of, active, flypapers, whose, mucilage, glands, are, borne, at, the, end, of, long, tentacles, which, frequently, grow, fast, enough, in, response, to, prey, thigmotropism, to, aid, the, trapping, process, the, tentacles, of, d, burmanii, can, bend, 180, in, a, minute, or, so, sundews, are, extremely, cosmopolitan, and, are, found, on, all, the, continents, except, the, antarctic, mainland, they, are, most, diverse, in, australia, the, home, to, the, large, subgroup, of, pygmy, sundews, such, as, d, pygmaea, and, to, a, number, of, tuberous, sundews, such, as, d, peltata, which, form, tubers, that, aestivate, during, the, dry, summer, months, these, species, are, so, dependent, on, insect, sources, of, nitrogen, that, they, generally, lack, the, enzyme, nitrate, reductase, which, most, plants, require, to, assimilate, soil, borne, nitrate, into, organic, forms, similar, to, drosera, is, the, portuguese, dewy, pine, drosophyllum, which, differs, from, the, sundews, in, being, passive, its, leaves, are, incapable, of, rapid, movement, or, growth, unrelated, but, similar, in, habit, are, the, australian, rainbow, plants, byblis, drosophyllum, is, unusual, in, that, it, grows, under, near, desert, conditions, almost, all, other, carnivores, are, either, bog, plants, or, grow, in, moist, tropical, areas, recent, molecular, data, particularly, the, production, of, plumbagin, indicate, that, the, remaining, flypaper, triphyophyllum, peltatum, a, member, of, the, dioncophyllaceae, is, closely, related, to, drosophyllum, and, forms, part, of, a, larger, clade, of, carnivorous, and, non, carnivorous, plants, with, the, droseraceae, nepenthaceae, ancistrocladaceae, and, plumbaginaceae, this, plant, is, usually, encountered, as, a, liana, but, in, its, juvenile, phase, the, plant, is, carnivorous, this, may, be, related, to, a, requirement, for, specific, nutrients, for, flowering, the, only, two, active, snap, traps, the, venus, flytrap, dionaea, muscipula, and, the, waterwheel, plant, aldrovanda, vesiculosa, had, a, common, ancestor, with, the, snap, trap, adaptation, which, had, evolved, from, an, ancestral, lineage, that, utilized, flypaper, traps, their, trapping, mechanism, has, also, been, described, as, a, mouse, trap, bear, trap, or, man, trap, based, on, their, shape, and, rapid, movement, however, the, term, snap, trap, is, preferred, as, other, designations, are, misleading, particularly, with, respect, to, the, intended, prey, aldrovanda, is, aquatic, and, specialized, in, catching, small, invertebrates, dionaea, is, terrestrial, and, catches, a, variety, of, arthropods, including, spiders, the, traps, are, very, similar, with, leaves, whose, terminal, section, is, divided, into, two, lobes, hinged, along, the, midrib, trigger, hairs, three, on, each, lobe, in, dionaea, muscipula, many, more, in, the, case, of, aldrovanda, inside, the, trap, lobes, are, sensitive, to, touch, when, a, trigger, hair, is, bent, stretch, gated, ion, channels, in, the, membranes, of, cells, at, the, base, of, the, trigger, hair, open, generating, an, action, potential, that, propagates, to, cells, in, the, midrib, these, cells, respond, by, pumping, out, ions, which, may, either, cause, water, to, follow, by, osmosis, collapsing, the, cells, in, the, midrib, or, cause, rapid, acid, growth, the, mechanism, is, still, debated, but, in, any, case, changes, in, the, shape, of, cells, in, the, midrib, allow, the, lobes, held, under, tension, to, snap, shut, flipping, rapidly, from, convex, to, concave, and, interring, the, prey, this, whole, process, takes, less, than, a, second, in, the, venus, flytrap, closure, in, response, to, raindrops, and, blown, in, debris, is, prevented, by, the, leaves, having, a, simple, memory, for, the, lobes, to, shut, two, stimuli, are, required, 0, 5, to, 30, seconds, apart, according, to, a, recent, study, calcium, molecules, move, dynamically, within, the, cells, of, the, plant, s, leaves, when, a, carnivorous, plant, touches, live, prey, changing, calcium, levels, make, leaves, move, to, catch, prey, likely, by, producing, more, hormones, related, to, defense, the, snapping, of, the, leaves, is, a, case, of, thigmonasty, undirected, movement, in, response, to, touch, further, stimulation, of, the, lobe, s, internal, surfaces, by, the, struggling, insects, causes, the, lobes, to, close, even, tighter, thigmotropism, sealing, the, lobes, hermetically, and, forming, a, stomach, in, which, digestion, occurs, over, a, period, of, one, to, two, weeks, once, this, process, is, triggered, it, cannot, be, reversed, and, requires, more, stimulation, to, trigger, the, next, steps, leaves, can, be, reused, three, or, four, times, before, they, become, unresponsive, to, stimulation, depending, on, the, growing, conditions, bladder, traps, are, exclusive, to, the, genus, utricularia, or, bladderworts, the, bladders, vesiculae, pump, ions, out, of, their, interiors, water, follows, by, osmosis, generating, a, partial, vacuum, inside, the, bladder, the, bladder, has, a, small, opening, sealed, by, a, hinged, door, in, aquatic, species, the, door, has, a, pair, of, long, trigger, hairs, aquatic, invertebrates, such, as, daphnia, touch, these, hairs, and, deform, the, door, by, lever, action, releasing, the, vacuum, the, invertebrate, is, sucked, into, the, bladder, where, it, is, digested, many, species, of, utricularia, such, as, u, sandersonii, are, terrestrial, growing, in, waterlogged, soil, and, their, trapping, mechanism, is, triggered, in, a, slightly, different, manner, bladderworts, lack, roots, but, terrestrial, species, have, anchoring, stems, that, resemble, roots, temperate, aquatic, bladderworts, generally, die, back, to, a, resting, turion, during, the, winter, months, and, u, macrorhiza, appears, to, regulate, the, number, of, bladders, it, bears, in, response, to, the, prevailing, nutrient, content, of, its, habitat, a, lobster, pot, trap, is, a, chamber, that, is, easy, to, enter, and, whose, exit, is, either, difficult, to, find, or, obstructed, by, inward, pointing, bristles, lobster, pots, are, the, trapping, mechanism, in, genlisea, the, corkscrew, plants, these, plants, appear, to, specialise, in, aquatic, protozoa, a, y, shaped, modified, leaf, allows, prey, to, enter, but, not, exit, inward, pointing, hairs, force, the, prey, to, move, in, a, particular, direction, prey, entering, the, spiral, entrance, that, coils, around, the, upper, two, arms, of, the, y, are, forced, to, move, inexorably, towards, a, stomach, in, the, lower, arm, of, the, y, where, they, are, digested, prey, movement, is, also, thought, to, be, encouraged, by, water, movement, through, the, trap, produced, in, a, similar, way, to, the, vacuum, in, bladder, traps, and, probably, evolutionarily, related, to, it, outside, of, genlisea, features, reminiscent, of, lobster, pot, traps, can, be, seen, in, sarracenia, psittacina, darlingtonia, californica, and, some, horticulturalists, argue, nepenthes, aristolochioides, the, trapping, mechanism, of, the, sundew, drosera, glanduligera, combines, features, of, both, flypaper, and, snap, traps, it, has, been, termed, a, catapult, flypaper, trap, similarly, nepenthes, jamban, is, a, combination, of, pitfall, and, flypaper, traps, because, it, has, a, sticky, pitcher, fluid, most, sumatran, nepenthes, like, n, inermis, also, have, this, method, for, example, n, dubia, and, n, flava, also, use, this, method, to, be, defined, as, carnivorous, a, plant, must, first, exhibit, an, adaptation, of, some, trait, specifically, for, the, attraction, capture, or, digestion, of, prey, only, one, trait, needs, to, have, evolved, that, fits, this, adaptive, requirement, as, many, current, carnivorous, plant, genera, lack, some, of, the, above, mentioned, attributes, the, second, requirement, is, the, ability, to, absorb, nutrients, from, dead, prey, and, gain, a, fitness, advantage, from, the, integration, of, these, derived, nutrients, mostly, amino, acids, and, ammonium, ions, either, through, increased, growth, or, pollen, and, or, seed, production, however, plants, that, may, opportunistically, utilise, nutrients, from, dead, animals, without, specifically, seeking, and, capturing, fauna, are, excluded, from, the, carnivorous, definition, the, second, requirement, also, differentiates, carnivory, from, defensive, plant, characteristics, that, may, kill, or, incapacitate, insects, without, the, advantage, of, nutrient, absorption, due, to, the, observation, that, many, currently, classified, carnivores, lack, digestive, enzymes, for, breaking, down, nutrients, and, instead, rely, upon, mutualistic, and, symbiotic, relationships, with, bacteria, ants, or, insects, this, adaptation, has, been, added, to, the, carnivorous, definition, despite, this, there, are, cases, where, plants, appear, carnivorous, in, that, they, fulfill, some, of, the, above, definition, but, are, not, truly, carnivorous, some, botanists, argue, that, there, is, a, spectrum, of, carnivory, found, in, plants, from, completely, non, carnivorous, plants, like, cabbages, to, borderline, carnivores, to, unspecialised, and, simple, traps, like, heliamphora, to, extremely, specialised, and, complex, traps, like, that, of, the, venus, flytrap, a, possible, carnivore, is, the, genus, roridula, the, plants, in, this, genus, produce, sticky, leaves, with, resin, tipped, glands, and, look, extremely, similar, to, some, of, the, larger, sundews, however, they, do, not, directly, benefit, from, the, insects, they, catch, instead, they, form, a, mutualistic, symbiosis, with, species, of, assassin, bug, genus, pameridea, which, eat, the, trapped, insects, the, plant, benefits, from, the, nutrients, in, the, bugs, feces, by, some, definitions, this, would, still, constitute, botanical, carnivory, a, number, of, species, in, the, martyniaceae, previously, pedaliaceae, such, as, ibicella, lutea, have, sticky, leaves, that, trap, insects, however, these, plants, have, not, been, shown, conclusively, to, be, carnivorous, likewise, the, seeds, of, shepherd, s, purse, urns, of, paepalanthus, bromelioides, bracts, of, passiflora, foetida, and, flower, stalks, and, sepals, of, triggerplants, stylidium, appear, to, trap, and, kill, insects, but, their, classification, as, carnivores, is, contentious, two, genera, of, liverwort, colura, and, pleurozia, have, sac, shaped, leaves, that, trap, and, kill, ciliates, and, may, digest, them, a, species, of, pitcher, plant, nepenthes, ampullaria, has, evolved, away, from, being, a, carnivore, rather, than, catching, animals, it, catches, falling, leaves, in, its, pitchers, specialized, multicellular, secretion, glands, produce, digestive, fluid, that, smother, kill, and, digest, prey, as, well, as, make, a, solution, to, assimilate, released, nutrients, saccharides, are, often, found, in, plants, that, have, adhesive, traps, or, plants, that, use, viscous, secretion, to, retain, captured, prey, the, digestion, fluid, is, often, nutrient, poor, and, has, ions, k, na, ca, 2, and, mg, 2, for, species, in, the, nepenthes, genera, for, example, along, with, numerous, proteins, which, vary, across, genera, peroxidases, are, also, involved, for, some, species, the, body, of, the, prey, is, decomposed, by, a, cocktail, of, hydrolytic, enzymes, which, are, stored, in, sub, cellular, compartments, or, synthesized, over, and, over, as, needed, proteins, of, digestive, fluid, include, proteases, chitinases, partly, destroy, exoskeleton, of, insects, phosphatases, and, nucleases, charles, darwin, spent, 16, years, growing, carnivorous, plants, experimenting, with, them, in, the, greenhouse, of, his, home, in, kent, down, house, in, his, pioneering, book, insectivorous, plants, 1875, darwin, concluded, that, carnivory, in, plants, was, convergent, writing, that, carnivorous, genera, utricularia, and, nepenthes, were, not, at, all, related, to, the, droseraceae, this, remained, a, subject, of, debate, for, over, a, century, in, 1960, leon, croizat, concluded, that, carnivory, was, monophyletic, and, placed, all, the, carnivorous, plants, together, at, the, base, of, the, angiosperms, molecular, studies, over, the, past, 30, years, have, led, to, a, wide, consensus, that, darwin, was, correct, with, studies, showing, that, carnivory, evolved, at, least, six, times, in, the, angiosperms, and, that, trap, designs, such, as, pitcher, traps, and, flypaper, traps, are, analogous, rather, than, homologous, researchers, using, molecular, data, have, concluded, that, carnivory, evolved, independently, in, the, poales, brocchinia, and, catopsis, in, the, bromeliaceae, the, caryophyllales, droseraceae, nepenthaceae, drosophyllaceae, dioncophyllaceae, the, oxalidales, cephalotus, the, ericales, sarraceniaceae, and, roridulaceae, and, twice, in, the, lamiales, lentibulariaceae, and, independently, in, byblidaceae, the, oldest, evolution, of, an, existing, carnivory, lineage, has, been, dated, to, 85, 6, million, years, ago, with, the, most, recent, being, brocchinia, reducta, in, the, bromeliaceae, estimated, at, only, 1, 9, mya, the, evolution, of, carnivorous, plants, is, obscured, by, the, paucity, of, their, fossil, record, very, few, fossils, have, been, found, and, then, usually, only, as, seed, or, pollen, carnivorous, plants, are, generally, herbs, and, their, traps, are, produced, by, primary, growth, they, generally, do, not, form, readily, fossilisable, structures, such, as, thick, bark, or, wood, researchers, are, increasingly, using, genome, sequencing, technology, to, examine, the, development, of, carnivorous, species, and, relationships, between, them, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, carnivory, developed, by, co, opting, and, repurposing, existing, genes, which, had, established, functions, in, flowering, plants, rather, than, by, hijacking, genes, from, other, types, of, organisms, most, carnivorous, plants, live, in, habitats, with, high, light, waterlogged, soils, and, extremely, low, soil, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, producing, the, ecological, impetus, to, derive, nitrogen, from, an, alternate, source, high, light, environments, allowed, for, the, trade, off, between, photosynthetic, leaves, and, photosynthetically, inefficient, prey, capturing, traps, to, compensate, for, the, photosynthetically, inefficient, material, the, nutrients, obtained, through, carnivory, would, need, to, increase, photosynthesis, by, investing, in, more, leaf, mass, i, e, growth, consequently, when, there, is, a, shortage, of, nutrients, sufficient, light, and, water, the, capture, and, digestion, of, prey, has, the, greatest, impact, on, photosynthetic, gains, thus, favoring, the, evolution, of, plant, adaptations, which, allowed, for, more, effective, efficient, carnivory, due, to, the, required, energy, and, resource, allocations, for, carnivorous, adaptations, e, g, the, production, of, lures, digestive, enzymes, modified, leaf, structures, and, the, decreased, rate, of, photosynthesis, over, total, leaf, area, some, authors, argue, that, carnivory, is, an, evolutionary, last, resort, when, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, are, extremely, limited, in, an, ecosystem, despite, meager, fossil, evidence, much, can, be, deduced, from, the, structure, of, current, traps, and, their, ecological, interactions, it, is, widely, believed, that, carnivory, evolved, under, extremely, nutrient, poor, conditions, leading, to, a, cost, benefit, model, for, botanical, carnivory, cost, benefit, models, are, used, under, the, assumption, that, there, is, a, set, amount, of, potential, energy, available, to, an, organism, which, leads, to, trade, offs, wherein, energy, is, allocated, to, certain, functions, to, maximize, competitive, ability, and, fitness, for, carnivory, the, trait, could, only, evolve, if, the, increase, in, nutrients, from, capturing, prey, exceeded, the, cost, of, investment, in, carnivorous, adaptations, pitfall, traps, are, derived, from, rolled, leaves, which, evolved, several, independent, times, through, convergent, evolution, the, vascular, tissues, of, sarracenia, is, a, case, in, point, the, keel, along, the, front, of, the, trap, contains, a, mixture, of, leftward, and, rightward, facing, vascular, bundles, as, would, be, predicted, from, the, fusion, of, the, edges, of, an, adaxial, stem, facing, leaf, surface, flypapers, also, show, a, simple, evolutionary, gradient, from, sticky, non, carnivorous, leaves, through, passive, flypapers, to, active, forms, molecular, data, show, the, dionaea, aldrovanda, clade, is, closely, related, to, drosera, and, evolved, from, active, flypaper, traps, into, snap, traps, it, has, been, suggested, that, all, trap, types, are, modifications, of, a, similar, basic, structure, the, hairy, leaf, hairy, or, more, specifically, stalked, glandular, leaves, can, catch, and, retain, drops, of, rainwater, especially, if, shield, shaped, or, peltate, thus, promoting, bacteria,

can, absorb, through, its, leaves, this, foliar, feeding, can, be, observed, in, most, non, carnivorous, plants, plants, that, were, better, at, retaining, insects, or, water, therefore, had, a, selective, advantage, rainwater, can, be, retained, by, cupping, the, leaf, and, pitfall, traps, may, have, evolved, simply, by, selection, pressure, for, the, production, of, more, deeply, cupped, leaves, followed, by, zipping, up, of, the, margins, and, subsequent, loss, of, most, of, the, hairs, alternatively, insects, can, be, retained, by, making, the, leaf, stickier, by, the, production, of, mucilage, leading, to, flypaper, traps, the, only, traps, that, are, unlikely, to, have, descended, from, a, hairy, leaf, or, sepal, are, the, carnivorous, bromeliads, brocchinia, and, catopsis, these, plants, use, the, urn, a, characteristic, part, of, all, bromeliads, not, just, the, carnivorous, ones, for, a, new, purpose, and, build, on, it, by, the, production, of, wax, and, the, other, paraphernalia, of, carnivory, the, lobster, pot, traps, of, genlisea, are, difficult, to, interpret, they, may, have, developed, from, bifurcated, pitchers, that, later, specialised, on, ground, dwelling, prey, or, perhaps, the, prey, guiding, protrusions, of, bladder, traps, became, more, substantial, than, the, net, like, funnel, found, in, most, aquatic, bladderworts, whatever, their, origin, the, helical, shape, of, the, lobster, pot, is, an, adaptation, that, displays, as, much, trapping, surface, as, possible, in, all, directions, when, buried, in, moss, the, traps, of, the, bladderworts, may, have, derived, from, pitchers, that, specialised, in, aquatic, prey, when, flooded, like, sarracenia, psittacina, does, today, escaping, prey, in, terrestrial, pitchers, have, to, climb, or, fly, out, of, a, trap, and, both, of, these, can, be, prevented, by, wax, gravity, and, narrow, tubes, however, a, flooded, trap, can, be, swum, out, of, so, in, utricularia, a, one, way, lid, may, have, developed, to, form, the, door, of, a, proto, bladder, later, this, may, have, become, active, by, the, evolution, of, a, partial, vacuum, inside, the, bladder, tripped, by, prey, brushing, against, trigger, hairs, on, the, door, of, the, bladder, the, active, glue, traps, use, rapid, plant, movements, to, trap, their, prey, rapid, plant, movement, can, result, from, actual,

growth, while, the, venus, flytrap, uses, such, rapid, turgor, changes, which, make, glue, unnecessary, the, stalked, glands, that, once, made, glue, became, teeth, and, trigger, hairs, in, species, with, active, snap, traps, an, example, of, natural, selection, hijacking, preexisting, structures, for, new, functions, recent, taxonomic, analysis, of, the, relationships, within, the, caryophyllales, indicate, that, the, droseraceae, triphyophyllum, nepenthaceae, and, drosophyllum, while, closely, related, are, embedded, within, a, larger, clade, that, includes, non, carnivorous, groups, such, as, the, tamarisks, ancistrocladaceae, polygonaceae, and, plumbaginaceae, the, tamarisks, possess, specialised, salt, excreting, glands, on, their, leaves, as, do, several, of, the, plumbaginaceae, such, as, the, sea, lavender, limonium, which, may, have, been, co, opted, for, the, excretion, of, other, chemicals, such, as, proteases, and, mucilage, some, of, the, plumbaginaceae, e, g, ceratostigma, also, have, stalked, vascularised, glands, that, secrete, mucilage, on, their, calyces, and, aid, in, seed, dispersal, and, possibly, in, protecting, the, flowers, from, crawling, parasitic, insects, the, balsams, such, as, impatiens, which, are, closely, related, to, the, sarraceniaceae, and, roridula, similarly, possess, stalked, glands, philcoxia, is, unique, in, the, plantaginaceae, as, a, result, of, its, subterranean, stems, and, leaves, which, have, been, shown, to, be, used, in, the, capture, of, nematodes, these, plants, grow, in, sand, in, brazil, where, they, are, likely, to, receive, other, nutrients, like, many, other, types, of, carnivorous, plant, stalked, glands, are, seen, on, the, leaves, enzymes, on, the, leaves, are, used, to, digest, the, worms, and, release, their, nutrients, botanical, carnivory, has, evolved, in, several, independent, families, peppered, throughout, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, showing, that, carnivorous, traits, underwent, convergent, evolution, multiple, times, to, create, similar, morphologies, across, disparate, families, results, of, genetic, testing, published, in, 2017, found, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, a, digestive, enzyme, with, the, same, functional, mutations, across, unrelated, lineages, carnivorous, plants, are, widespread, but, rather, rare, they, are, almost, entirely, restricted, to, habitats, such, as, bogs, where, soil, nutrients, are, extremely, limiting, but, where, sunlight, and, water, are, readily, available, only, under, such, extreme, conditions, is, carnivory, favored, to, an, extent, that, makes, the, adaptations, advantageous, the, archetypal, carnivore, the, venus, flytrap, grows, in, soils, with, almost, immeasurable, nitrate, and, calcium, levels, plants, need, nitrogen, for, protein, synthesis, calcium, for, cell, wall, stiffening, phosphate, for, nucleic, acid, synthesis, and, iron, and, magnesium, for, chlorophyll, synthesis, the, soil, is, often, waterlogged, which, favours, the, production, of, toxic, ions, such, as, ammonium, and, its, ph, is, an, acidic, 4, to, 5, ammonium, can, be, used, as, a, source, of, nitrogen, by, plants, but, its, high, toxicity, means, that, concentrations, high, enough, to, fertilise, are, also, high, enough, to, cause, damage, however, the, habitat, is, warm, sunny, constantly, moist, and, the, plant, experiences, relatively, little, competition, from, low, growing, sphagnum, moss, still, carnivores, are, also, found, in, very, atypical, habitats, drosophyllum, lusitanicum, is, found, around, desert, edges, and, pinguicula, valisneriifolia, on, limestone, calcium, rich, cliffs, in, all, the, studied, cases, carnivory, allows, plants, to, grow, and, reproduce, using, animals, as, a, source, of, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, possibly, potassium, however, there, is, a, spectrum, of, dependency, on, animal, prey, pygmy, sundews, are, unable, to, use, nitrate, from, soil, because, they, lack, the, necessary, enzymes, nitrate, reductase, in, particular, common, butterworts, pinguicula, vulgaris, can, use, inorganic, sources, of, nitrogen, better, than, organic, sources, but, a, mixture, of, both, is, preferred, european, bladderworts, seem, to, use, both, sources, equally, well, animal, prey, makes, up, for, differing, deficiencies, in, soil, nutrients, plants, use, their, leaves, to, intercept, sunlight, the, energy, is, used, to, reduce, carbon, dioxide, from, the, air, with, electrons, from, water, to, make, sugars, and, other, biomass, and, a, waste, product, oxygen, in, the, process, of, photosynthesis, leaves, also, respire, in, a, similar, way, to, animals, by, burning, their, biomass, to, generate, chemical, energy, this, energy, is, temporarily, stored, in, the, form, of, atp, adenosine, triphosphate, which, acts, as, an, energy, currency, for, metabolism, in, all, living, things, as, a, waste, product, respiration, produces, carbon, dioxide, for, a, plant, to, grow, it, must, photosynthesise, more, than, it, respires, otherwise, it, will, eventually, exhaust, its, biomass, and, die, the, potential, for, plant, growth, is, net, photosynthesis, the, total, gross, gain, of, biomass, by, photosynthesis, minus, the, biomass, lost, by, respiration, understanding, carnivory, requires, a, cost, benefit, analysis, of, these, factors, in, carnivorous, plants, the, leaf, is, not, just, used, to, photosynthesise, but, also, as, a, trap, changing, the, leaf, shape, to, make, it, a, better, trap, generally, makes, it, less, efficient, at, photosynthesis, for, example, pitchers, have, to, be, held, upright, so, that, only, their, opercula, directly, intercept, light, the, plant, also, has, to, expend, extra, energy, on, non, photosynthetic, structures, like, glands, hairs, glue, and, digestive, enzymes, to, produce, such, structures, the, plant, requires, atp, and, respires, more, of, its, biomass, hence, a, carnivorous, plant, will, have, both, decreased, photosynthesis, and, increased, respiration, making, the, potential, for, growth, small, and, the, cost, of, carnivory, high, being, carnivorous, allows, the, plant, to, grow, better, when, the, soil, contains, little, nitrate, or, phosphate, in, particular, an, increased, supply, of, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, makes, photosynthesis, more, efficient, because, photosynthesis, depends, on, the, plant, being, able, to, synthesise, very, large, amounts, of, the, nitrogen, rich, enzyme, rubisco, ribulose, 1, 5, bis, phosphate, carboxylase, oxygenase, the, most, abundant, protein, on, earth, it, is, intuitively, clear, that, the, venus, flytrap, is, more, carnivorous, than, triphyophyllum, peltatum, the, former, is, a, full, time, moving, snap, trap, the, latter, is, a, part, time, non, moving, flypaper, the, energy, wasted, by, the, plant, in, building, and, fuelling, its, trap, is, a, suitable, measure, of, the, carnivory, of, the, trap, using, this, measure, of, investment, in, carnivory, a, model, can, be, proposed, above, is, a, graph, of, carbon, dioxide, uptake, potential, for, growth, against, trap, respiration, investment, in, carnivory, for, a, leaf, in, a, sunny, habitat, containing, no, soil, nutrients, at, all, respiration, is, a, straight, line, sloping, down, under, the, horizontal, axis, respiration, produces, carbon, dioxide, gross, photosynthesis, is, a, curved, line, above, the, horizontal, axis, as, investment, increases, so, too, does, the, photosynthesis, of, the, trap, as, the, leaf, receives, a, better, supply, of, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, eventually, another, factor, such, as, light, intensity, or, carbon, dioxide, concentration, will, become, more, limiting, to, photosynthesis, than, nitrogen, or, phosphorus, supply, as, a, result, increasing, the, investment, will, not, make, the, plant, grow, better, the, net, uptake, of, carbon, dioxide, and, therefore, the, plant, s, potential, for, growth, must, be, positive, for, the, plant, to, survive, there, is, a, broad, span, of, investment, where, this, is, the, case, and, there, is, also, a, non, zero, optimum, plants, investing, more, or, less, than, this, optimum, will, take, up, less, carbon, dioxide, than, an, optimal, plant, hence, grow, less, well, these, plants, will, be, at, a, selective, disadvantage, at, zero, investment, the, growth, is, zero, because, a, non, carnivorous, plant, cannot, survive, in, a, habitat, with, absolutely, no, soil, borne, nutrients, such, habitats, do, not, exist, so, for, example, sphagnum, absorbs, the, tiny, amounts, of, nitrates, and, phosphates, in, rain, very, efficiently, and, also, forms, symbioses, with, diazotrophic, cyanobacteria, in, a, habitat, with, abundant, soil, nutrients, but, little, light, as, shown, above, the, gross, photosynthesis, curve, will, be, lower, and, flatter, because, light, will, be, more, limiting, than, nutrients, a, plant, can, grow, at, zero, investment, in, carnivory, this, is, also, the, optimum, investment, for, a, plant, as, any, investment, in, traps, reduces, net, photosynthesis, growth, to, less, than, the, net, photosynthesis, of, a, plant, that, obtains, its, nutrients, from, soil, alone, carnivorous, plants, exist, between, these, two, extremes, the, less, limiting, light, and, water, are, and, the, more, limiting, soil, nutrients, are, the, higher, the, optimum, investment, in, carnivory, and, hence, the, more, obvious, the, adaptations, will, be, to, the, casual, observer, the, most, obvious, evidence, for, this, model, is, that, carnivorous, plants, tend, to, grow, in, habitats, where, water, and, light, are, abundant, and, where, competition, is, relatively, low, the, typical, bog, those, that, do, not, tend, to, be, even, more, fastidious, in, some, other, way, drosophyllum, lusitanicum, grows, where, there, is, little, water, but, it, is, even, more, extreme, in, its, requirement, for, bright, light, and, low, disturbance, than, most, other, carnivores, pinguicula, valisneriifolia, grows, in, soils, with, high, levels, of, calcium, but, requires, strong, illumination, and, lower, competition, than, many, butterworts, in, general, carnivorous, plants, are, poor, competitors, because, they, invest, too, heavily, in, structures, that, have, no, selective, advantage, in, nutrient, rich, habitats, they, succeed, only, where, other, plants, fail, carnivores, are, to, nutrients, what, cacti, are, to, water, carnivory, only, pays, off, when, the, nutrient, stress, is, high, and, where, light, is, abundant, when, these, conditions, are, not, met, some, plants, give, up, carnivory, temporarily, sarracenia, spp, produce, flat, non, carnivorous, leaves, phyllodes, in, winter, light, levels, are, lower, than, in, summer, so, light, is, more, limiting, than, nutrients, and, carnivory, does, not, pay, the, lack, of, insects, in, winter, exacerbates, the, problem, damage, to, growing, pitcher, leaves, prevents, them, from, forming, proper, pitchers, and, again, the, plant, produces, a, phyllode, instead, many, other, carnivores, shut, down, in, some, seasons, tuberous, sundews, die, back, to, tubers, in, the, dry, season, bladderworts, to, turions, in, winter, and, non, carnivorous, leaves, are, made, by, most, butterworts, and, cephalotus, in, the, less, favourable, seasons, utricularia, macrorhiza, varies, the, number, of, bladders, it, produces, based, on, the, expected, density, of, prey, part, time, carnivory, in, triphyophyllum, peltatum, may, be, due, to, an, unusually, high, need, for, potassium, at, a, certain, point, in, the, life, cycle, just, before, flowering, the, more, carnivorous, a, plant, is, the, less, conventional, its, habitat, is, likely, to, be, venus, flytraps, live, in, a, very, specialised, habitat, whereas, less, carnivorous, plants, byblis, pinguicula, are, found, in, less, unusual, habitats, i, e, those, typical, for, non, carnivores, byblis, and, drosophyllum, both, come, from, relatively, arid, regions, and, are, both, passive, flypapers, arguably, the, lowest, maintenance, form, of, trap, venus, flytraps, filter, their, prey, using, the, teeth, around, the, trap, s, edge, so, as, not, to, waste, energy, on, hard, to, digest, prey, in, evolution, laziness, pays, because, energy, can, be, used, for, reproduction, and, short, term, benefits, in, reproduction, will, outweigh, long, term, benefits, in, anything, else, carnivory, rarely, pays, so, even, carnivorous, plants, avoid, it, when, there, is, too, little, light, or, an, easier, source, of, nutrients, and, they, use, as, few, carnivorous, features, as, are, required, at, a, given, time, or, for, a, given, prey, item, there, are, very, few, habitats, stressful, enough, to, make, investing, biomass, and, energy, in, trigger, hairs, and, enzymes, worthwhile, many, plants, occasionally, benefit, from, animal, protein, rotting, on, their, leaves, but, carnivory, that, is, obvious, enough, for, the, casual, observer, to, notice, is, rare, bromeliads, seem, very, well, preadapted, to, carnivory, but, only, one, or, two, species, can, be, classified, as, truly, carnivorous, by, their, very, shape, bromeliads, will, benefit, from, increased, prey, derived, nutrient, input, in, this, sense, bromeliads, are, probably, carnivorous, but, their, habitats, are, too, dark, for, more, extreme, recognisable, carnivory, to, evolve, most, bromeliads, are, epiphytes, and, most, epiphytes, grow, in, partial, shade, on, tree, branches, brocchinia, reducta, on, the, other, hand, is, a, ground, dweller, many, carnivorous, plants, are, not, strongly, competitive, and, rely, on, circumstances, to, suppress, dominating, vegetation, accordingly, some, of, them, rely, on, fire, ecology, for, their, continued, survival, for, the, most, part, carnivorous, plant, populations, are, not, dominant, enough, to, be, dramatically, significant, ecologically, speaking, but, there, is, an, impressive, variety, of, organisms, that, interact, with, various, carnivorous, plants, in, sundry, relationships, of, kleptoparasitism, commensalism, and, mutualism, for, example, small, insectivores, such, as, tree, frogs, often, exploit, the, supply, of, prey, to, be, found, in, pitcher, plants, and, the, frog, microhyla, nepenthicola, actually, specialises, in, such, habitats, certain, crab, spiders, such, as, henriksenia, nepenthicola, and, h, labuanica, live, largely, on, the, prey, of, nepenthes, and, other, less, specialised, spiders, may, build, webs, where, they, trap, insects, attracted, by, the, smell, or, appearance, of, the, traps, some, scavengers, detritivores, and, also, organisms, that, harvest, or, exploit, those, in, turn, such, as, the, mosquito, wyeomyia, smithii, are, largely, or, totally, dependent, on, particular, carnivorous, plants, plants, such, as, roridula, species, combine, with, specialised, bugs, pameridea, roridulae, in, benefiting, from, insects, trapped, on, their, leaves, associations, with, species, of, pitcher, plants, are, so, many, and, varied, that, the, study, of, nepenthes, infauna, is, something, of, a, discipline, in, its, own, right, camponotus, schmitzi, the, diving, ant, has, an, intimate, degree, of, mutualism, with, the, pitcher, plant, nepenthes, bicalcarata, it, not, only, retrieves, prey, and, detritus, from, beneath, the, surface, of, the, liquid, in, the, pitchers, but, repels, herbivores, and, cleans, the, pitcher, peristome, maintaining, its, slippery, nature, the, ants, have, been, reported, to, attack, struggling, prey, hindering, their, escape, so, there, might, be, an, element, of, myrmecotrophy, to, the, relationship, numerous, species, of, mosquitoes, lay, their, eggs, in, the, liquid, where, their, larvae, play, various, roles, depending, on, species, some, eat, microbes, and, detritus, as, is, common, among, mosquito, larvae, whereas, some, species, of, toxorhynchites, also, breed, in, pitchers, and, their, larvae, are, predators, of, other, species, of, mosquito, larvae, apart, from, the, crab, spiders, on, pitchers, an, actual, small, red, crab, geosesarma, malayanum, will, enter, the, fluid, robbing, and, scavenging, though, reputedly, it, does, so, at, some, risk, of, being, captured, and, digested, itself, nepenthes, rajah, has, a, remarkable, mutualism, with, two, unrelated, small, mammals, the, mountain, treeshrew, tupaia, montana, and, the, summit, rat, rattus, baluensis, the, tree, shrews, and, the, rats, defecate, into, the, plant, s, traps, while, visiting, them, to, feed, on, sweet, fruity, secretions, from, glands, on, the, pitcher, lids, the, tree, shrew, also, has, a, similar, relationship, with, at, least, two, other, giant, species, of, nepenthes, more, subtly, hardwicke, s, woolly, bat, kerivoula, hardwickii, a, small, species, roosts, beneath, the, operculum, lid, of, nepenthes, hemsleyana, the, bat, s, excretions, that, land, in, the, pitcher, pay, for, the, shelter, as, it, were, to, the, plant, the, excreta, are, more, readily, assimilable, than, intact, insects, would, be, there, also, is, a, considerable, list, of, nepenthes, endophytes, these, are, microbes, other, than, pathogens, that, live, in, the, tissues, of, pitcher, plants, often, apparently, harmlessly, another, important, area, of, symbiosis, between, carnivorous, plants, and, insects, is, pollination, while, many, species, of, carnivorous, plant, can, reproduce, asexually, via, self, pollination, or, vegetative, propagation, many, carnivorous, plants, are, insect, pollinated, outcross, pollination, is, beneficial, as, it, increases, genetic, diversity, this, means, that, carnivorous, plants, undergo, an, evolutionary, and, ecological, conflict, often, called, the, pollinator, prey, conflict, there, are, several, ways, by, which, carnivorous, plants, reduce, the, strain, of, the, pollinator, prey, conflict, for, long, lived, plants, the, short, term, loss, of, reproduction, may, be, offset, by, the, future, growth, made, possible, by, resources, obtained, from, prey, other, plants, might, target, different, species, of, insect, for, pollination, and, prey, using, different, olfactory, and, visual, cues, approximately, half, of, the, plant, species, assessed, by, the, iucn, are, considered, threatened, vulnerable, endangered, or, critically, endangered, common, threats, are, habitat, loss, as, a, result, of, agriculture, collection, of, wild, plants, pollution, invasive, species, residential, and, commercial, development, energy, production, mining, transportation, services, geologic, events, climate,

residential, and, commercial, development, natural, systems, modifications, invasive, species, and, pollution, having, positive, associations, conservation, research, is, aiming, to, further, quantify, the, effects, of, threats, such, as, pollution, on, carnivorous, plants, as, well, as, to, quantify, the, extinction, risks, only, 17, of, species, had, been, assessed, as, of, 2011, according, to, the, iucn, carnivorous, plant, conservation, will, help, maintain, important, ecosystems, and, prevent, secondary, extinctions, of, specialist, species, that, rely, on, them, such, as, foundation, species, which, may, seek, refuge, or, rely, on, certain, plants, for, their, existence, research, suggests, a, holistic, approach, targeted, at, the, habitat, level, of, carnivorous, plants, may, be, required, for, successful, conservation, the, classification, of, all, flowering, plants, is, currently, in, a, state, of, flux, in, the, cronquist, system, the, droseraceae, and, nepenthaceae, were, placed, in, the, order, nepenthales, based, on, the, radial, symmetry, of, their, flowers, and, their, possession, of, insect, traps, the, sarraceniaceae, was, placed, either, in, the, nepenthales, or, in, its, own, order, the, sarraceniales, the, byblidaceae, cephalotaceae, and, roridulaceae, were, placed, in, the, saxifragales, and, the, lentibulariaceae, in, the, scrophulariales, now, subsumed, into, the, lamiales, in, more, modern, classification, such, as, that, of, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, group, the, families, have, been, retained, but, they, have, been, redistributed, amongst, several, disparate, orders, it, is, also, recommended, that, drosophyllum, be, considered, in, a, monotypic, family, outside, the, rest, of, the, droseraceae, probably, more, closely, allied, to, the, dioncophyllaceae, the, current, recommendations, are, shown, below, only, carnivorous, genera, are, listed, in, horticulture, carnivorous, plants, are, considered, a, curiosity, or, a, rarity, but, are, becoming, more, common, in, cultivation, with, the, advent, of, mass, production, tissue, culture, propagation, techniques, venus, flytraps, are, still, the, most, commonly, grown, usually, available, at, garden, centers, and, hardware, stores, sometimes, offered, alongside, other, easy, to, grow, varieties, nurseries, that, specialise, in, growing, carnivorous, plants, exclusively, also, exist, more, uncommon, or, demanding, varieties, of, carnivorous, plants, can, be, obtained, from, specialist, nurseries, california, carnivores, is, a, notable, example, of, such, a, nursery, in, the, us, that, specialises, in, the, cultivation, of, carnivorous, plants, it, is, owned, and, operated, by, horticulturalist, peter, d, amato, rob, cantley, s, borneo, exotics, in, sri, lanka, is, a, large, nursery, that, sells, worldwide, although, different, species, of, carnivorous, plants, have, different, cultivation, requirements, in, terms, of, sunlight, humidity, soil, moisture, etc, there, are, commonalities, most, carnivorous, plants, require, rainwater, or, water, that, has, been, distilled, or, deionised, by, reverse, osmosis, common, tap, or, drinking, water, contains, minerals, particularly, calcium, salts, that, will, quickly, build, up, and, kill, the, plant, this, is, because, most, carnivorous, plants, have, evolved, in, nutrient, poor, acidic, soils, and, are, consequently, extreme, calcifuges, they, are, therefore, very, sensitive, to, excessive, soil, borne, nutrients, since, most, of, these, plants, are, found, in, bogs, almost, all, are, very, intolerant, of, drying, there, are, exceptions, tuberous, sundews, require, a, dry, summer, dormancy, period, and, drosophyllum, requires, much, drier, conditions, than, most, outdoor, grown, carnivorous, plants, generally, catch, more, than, enough, insects, to, keep, themselves, properly, fed, insects, may, be, fed, to, the, plants, by, hand, to, supplement, their, diet, however, carnivorous, plants, are, generally, unable, to, digest, large, non, insect, food, items, bits, of, hamburger, for, example, will, simply, rot, and, this, may, cause, the, trap, or, even, the, whole, plant, to, die, a, carnivorous, plant, that, catches, no, insects, at, all, will, rarely, die, although, its, growth, may, be, impaired, in, general, these, plants, are, best, left, to, their, own, devices, after, underwatering, with, tap, water, the, most, common, cause, of, venus, flytrap, death, is, prodding, the, traps, to, watch, them, close, and, feeding, them, inappropriate, items, most, carnivorous, plants, require, bright, light, and, most, will, look, better, under, such, conditions, as, this, encourages, them, to, synthesise, red, and, purple, anthocyanin, pigments, or, betalain, pigments, within, caryophyllales, nepenthes, and, pinguicula, will, do, better, out, of, full, sun, but, most, other, species, are, happy, in, direct, sunlight, carnivores, mostly, live, in, bogs, and, those, that, do, not, are, generally, tropical, hence, most, require, high, humidity, on, a, small, scale, this, can, be, achieved, by, placing, the, plant, in, a, wide, saucer, containing, pebbles, that, are, kept, permanently, wet, small, nepenthes, species, grow, well, in, large, terraria, many, carnivores, are, native, to, cold, temperate, regions, and, can, be, grown, outside, in, a, bog, garden, year, round, most, sarracenia, can, tolerate, temperatures, well, below, freezing, despite, most, species, being, native, to, the, southeastern, united, states, species, of, drosera, and, pinguicula, also, tolerate, subfreezing, temperatures, nepenthes, species, which, are, tropical, require, temperatures, from, 20, to, 30, c, to, thrive, carnivorous, plants, require, appropriate, nutrient, poor, soil, most, appreciate, a, 3, 1, mixture, of, sphagnum, peat, to, sharp, horticultural, sand, coir, is, an, acceptable, and, more, ecofriendly, substitute, for, peat, nepenthes, will, grow, in, orchid, compost, or, in, pure, sphagnum, moss, carnivorous, plants, are, themselves, susceptible, to, infestation, by, parasites, such, as, aphids, or, mealybugs, although, small, infestations, can, be, removed, by, hand, larger, infestations, necessitate, use, of, an, insecticide, isopropyl, alcohol, rubbing, alcohol, is, effective, as, a, topical, insecticide, particularly, on, scale, insects, diazinon, is, an, excellent, systemic, insecticide, that, is, tolerated, by, most, carnivorous, plants, malathion, and, acephate, orthene, have, also, been, reported, as, tolerable, by, carnivorous, plants, although, insects, can, be, a, problem, by, far, the, biggest, killer, of, carnivorous, plants, besides, human, maltreatment, is, grey, mold, botrytis, cinerea, this, thrives, under, warm, humid, conditions, and, can, be, a, real, problem, in, winter, to, some, extent, temperate, carnivorous, plants, can, be, protected, from, this, pathogen, by, ensuring, that, they, are, kept, cool, and, well, ventilated, in, winter, and, that, any, dead, leaves, are, removed, promptly, if, this, fails, a, fungicide, is, in, order, the, easiest, carnivorous, plants, for, beginners, are, those, from, the, cool, temperate, zone, these, plants, will, do, well, under, cool, greenhouse, conditions, minimum, 5, c, in, winter, maximum, 25, c, in, summer, if, kept, in, wide, trays, of, acidified, or, rain, water, during, summer, and, kept, moist, during, winter, venus, flytraps, will, do, well, under, these, conditions, but, are, actually, rather, difficult, to, grow, even, if, treated, well, they, will, often, succumb, to, grey, mold, in, winter, unless, well, ventilated, some, of, the, lowland, nepenthes, are, very, easy, to, grow, as, long, as, they, are, provided, with, relatively, constant, hot, and, humid, conditions, a, study, published, in, 2009, by, researchers, from, tel, aviv, university, indicates, that, secretions, produced, by, carnivorous, plants, contain, compounds, that, have, anti, fungal, properties, and, may, lead, to, the, development, of, a, new, class, of, anti, fungal, drugs, that, will, be, effective, against, infections, that, are, resistant, to, current, anti, fungal, drugs, in, 1789, erasmus, darwin, described, drosera, in, the, second, part, of, his, poem, the, botanic, garden, queen, of, the, marsh, imperial, drosera, treads, rush, fringed, banks, and, moss, embroider, d, beds, bright, shines, the, silver, halo, as, she, turns, and, as, she, steps, the, living, lustre, burns, however, erasmus, darwin, and, others, of, his, generation, assumed, that, the, wonderful, contrivance, of, carnivorous, plants, were, solely, defense, mechanisms, to, prevent, various, insects, from, plundering, the, honey, or, devouring, the, seed, they, realized, that, the, plants, were, killing, insects, but, did, not, understand, why, erasmus, darwin, s, grandson, charles, darwin, and, great, grandson, francis, darwin, spent, many, years, studying, carnivorous, plants, charles, darwin, recognized, and, described, the, significance, of, plant, carnivory, for, nutrition, in, 1860, residents, of, providence, rhode, island, dug, up, the, grave, of, that, state, s, founder, roger, williams, intending, to, move, his, remains, to, a, new, memorial, in, his, honor, they, found, only, teeth, nails, bone, fragments, and, an, apple, tree, root, that, had, grown, along, where, his, body, had, been, forking, midway, to, follow, his, legs, the, now, severed, root, forms, its, own, sort, of, memorial, and, has, been, called, the, tree, or, root, that, ate, roger, williams, possibly, the, earliest, published, account, of, a, man, eating, plant, was, a, literary, fabrication, that, first, appeared, in, 1874, the, story, of, crinoida, dajeeana, also, known, as, the, devil, tree, of, madagascar, or, man, eating, tree, of, madagascar, first, appeared, in, the, daily, edition, of, the, new, york, world, on, 26, april, 1874, and, again, in, the, weekly, edition, two, days, later, it, purported, to, be, from, a, german, explorer, named, karl, leche, also, spelled, as, karl, or, carl, liche, in, later, accounts, who, described, seeing, a, woman, fed, to, a, tree, as, a, sacrifice, by, the, little, known, but, cruel, mkodo, tribe, of, madagascar, authorship, of, the, fantastical, story, would, later, be, attributed, by, frederick, maxwell, somers, to, one, edmund, spencer, in, the, august, 1888, issue, of, the, magazine, current, literature, the, story, was, reprinted, widely, appearing, as, far, away, as, the, south, australian, register, in, 1881, where, it, was, accompanied, by, an, illustration, of, a, tree, consuming, a, woman, the, account, has, been, debunked, as, pure, myth, and, dr, liche, the, mkodos, and, the, tree, itself, were, all, fabrications, crinoida, dajeeana, notwithstanding, carnivorous, plants, are, credited, with, widely, entering, the, popular, imagination, through, the, nonfiction, publications, of, charles, darwin, insectivorous, plants, 1875, followed, by, the, power, of, movement, in, plants, 1880, challenged, the, idea, of, a, what, a, plant, was, and, what, it, was, capable, of, doing, and, inspired, authors, like, arthur, conan, doyle, to, imagine, enormous, and, sometimes, mobile, man, eaters, doyle, modeled, the, sticky, end, of, a, character, in, the, american, s, tale, 1880, on, a, venus, flytrap, h, g, wells, imagined, a, tentacular, blood, sucking, plant, in, the, flowering, of, the, strange, orchid, 1894, since, then, carnivorous, plants, have, been, the, subject, of, popular, interest, and, exposition, much, of, it, highly, inaccurate, typically, these, fictional, depictions, include, exaggerated, characteristics, such, as, enormous, size, or, possession, of, abilities, beyond, the, realm, of, reality, and, can, be, viewed, as, a, kind, of, artistic, license, in, a, 1939, pamphlet, on, carnivorous, plants, written, for, the, field, museum, sophia, prior, recounts, the, man, eating, tree, of, madagascar, and, other, stories, of, vegetable, monsters, she, dismisses, them, all, as, fables, and, notes, that, they, are, invariably, set, in, locales, that, are, indefinite, and, difficult, of, access, fictional, carnivorous, plants, have, been, featured, in, books, movies, television, series, and, video, games, some, such, as, the, mockumentary, the, hellstrom, chronicle, 1971, use, accurate, depictions, of, carnivorous, plants, for, cinematic, purposes, while, others, depend, more, heavily, on, imagination, two, of, the, most, famous, examples, of, fictional, carnivorous, plants, in, popular, culture, are, the, triffids, of, john, wyndham, s, 1951, novel, the, day, of, the, triffids, and, audrey, jr, ii, the, man, eating, plant, in, the, 1960s, black, comedy, the, little, shop, of, horrors, and, its, subsequent, stage, musical, adaptation
