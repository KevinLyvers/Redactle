see, text, for, orders, malacostraca, from, neo, latin, from, ancient, greek, malak, s, soft, and, strakon, shell, is, the, second, largest, of, the, six, classes, of, pancrustaceans, behind, insects, containing, about, 40, 000, living, species, divided, among, 16, orders, its, members, the, malacostracans, display, a, great, diversity, of, body, forms, and, include, crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, krill, prawns, woodlice, amphipods, mantis, shrimp, tongue, eating, lice, and, many, other, less, familiar, animals, they, are, abundant, in, all, marine, environments, and, have, colonised, freshwater, and, terrestrial, habitats, they, are, segmented, animals, united, by, a, common, body, plan, comprising, 20, body, segments, rarely, 21, and, divided, into, a, head, thorax, and, abdomen, the, name, malacostraca, was, coined, by, a, french, zoologist, pierre, andr, latreille, in, 1802, he, was, curator, of, the, arthropod, collection, at, the, national, museum, of, natural, history, in, paris, the, name, comes, from, the, greek, roots, malak, s, meaning, soft, and, strakon, meaning, shell, the, name, is, misleading, since, the, shell, is, soft, only, immediately, after, moulting, and, is, usually, hard, the, word, was, used, by, aristotle, who, contrasted, them, with, oysters, in, comparison, with, which, their, shells, are, pliable, malacostracans, are, sometimes, contrasted, with, entomostracans, a, name, applied, to, all, crustaceans, outside, the, malacostraca, and, named, after, the, obsolete, taxon, entomostraca, the, class, malacostraca, includes, about, 40, 000, species, and, arguably, contains, a, greater, diversity, of, body, forms, than, any, other, class, in, the, animal, kingdom, its, members, are, characterised, by, the, presence, of, three, tagmata, specialized, groupings, of, multiple, segments, a, five, segmented, head, an, eight, segmented, thorax, and, an, abdomen, with, six, segments, and, a, telson, except, in, the, leptostraca, which, retain, the, ancestral, condition, of, seven, abdominal, segments, malacostracans, have, abdominal, appendages, a, fact, that, differentiates, them, from, all, other, major, crustacean, taxa, except, remipedia, each, body, segment, bears, a, pair, of, jointed, appendages, although, these, may, be, lost, secondarily, the, head, bears, two, pairs, of, antennae, the, first, of, which, is, often, biramous, branching, into, two, parts, and, the, second, pair, bear, exopods, outer, branches, which, are, often, flattened, into, antennal, scales, known, as, scaphocerites, the, mouthparts, consist, of, pairs, each, of, mandibles, maxillules, second, pair, of, mouthparts, and, maxillae, except, for, fairy, shrimps, malacostracans, are, the, only, extant, arthropods, with, compound, eyes, placed, on, moveable, stalks, although, in, some, taxa, the, eyes, are, unstalked, reduced, or, lost, up, to, three, thoracic, segments, may, be, fused, with, the, head, to, form, a, cephalothorax, the, associated, appendages, turn, forward, and, are, modified, as, maxillipeds, accessory, mouthparts, a, carapace, may, be, absent, present, or, secondarily, lost, and, may, cover, the, head, part, or, all, of, the, thorax, and, some, of, the, abdomen, it, is, variable, in, form, and, may, be, fused, dorsally, with, some, of, the, thoracic, segments, or, occasionally, be, in, two, parts, hinged, dorsally, typically, each, of, the, thoracic, appendages, is, biramous, and, the, endopods, are, the, better, developed, of, the, branches, being, used, for, crawling, or, grasping, each, endopod, consist, of, seven, articulating, segments, the, coxa, basis, ischium, merus, carpus, propodus, and, dactylus, in, decapods, the, claw, is, formed, by, the, articulation, of, the, dactylus, against, an, outgrowth, of, the, propodus, in, some, taxa, the, exopods, are, lost, and, the, appendages, are, uniramous, there, is, a, clear, demarcation, between, the, thorax, and, the, six, or, seven, segmented, abdomen, in, most, taxa, each, abdominal, segment, except, the, last, carries, a, pair, of, biramous, pleopods, used, for, swimming, burrowing, gas, exchange, creating, a, current, or, brooding, eggs, the, first, and, second, abdominal, pleopods, may, be, modified, in, the, male, to, form, gonopods, accessory, copulatory, appendages, the, appendages, of, the, last, segment, are, typically, flattened, into, uropods, which, together, with, the, terminal, telson, make, up, the, tail, fan, it, is, the, sudden, flexion, of, this, tail, fan, that, provides, the, thrust, for, the, rapid, escape, response, of, these, crustaceans, and, the, tail, fan, is, also, used, in, steering, in, leptostraca, the, appendages, on, the, telson, instead, form, caudal, rami, spine, like, protrusions, the, digestive, tract, is, straight, and, the, foregut, consists, of, a, short, oesophagus, and, a, two, chambered, stomach, the, first, part, of, which, contains, a, gizzard, like, gastric, mill, for, grinding, food, the, walls, of, this, have, chitinous, ridges, teeth, and, calcareous, ossicles, the, fine, particles, and, soluble, material, are, then, moved, into, the, midgut, where, chemical, processing, and, absorption, takes, place, in, one, or, more, pairs, of, large, digestive, caeca, the, hindgut, is, concerned, with, water, reclamation, and, the, formation, of, faeces, and, the, anus, is, situated, at, the, base, of, the, telson, like, other, crustaceans, malacostracans, have, an, open, circulatory, system, in, which, the, heart, pumps, blood, into, the, hemocoel, body, cavity, where, it, supplies, the, needs, of, the, organs, for, oxygen, and, nutrients, before, diffusing, back, to, the, heart, the, typical, respiratory, pigment, in, malacostracans, is, haemocyanin, structures, that, function, as, kidneys, are, located, near, the, base, of, the, antennae, a, brain, exists, in, the, form, of, ganglia, close, to, the, antennae, there, are, ganglia, in, each, segment, and, a, collection, of, major, ganglia, below, the, oesophagus, sensory, organs, include, compound, eyes, often, stalked, ocelli, simple, eyes, statocysts, and, sensory, bristles, the, naupliar, eye, is, a, characteristic, of, the, nauplius, larva, and, consists, of, four, cup, shaped, ocelli, facing, in, different, directions, and, able, to, distinguish, between, light, and, darkness, malacostracans, live, in, a, wide, range, of, marine, and, freshwater, habitats, and, three, orders, have, terrestrial, members, amphipoda, talitridae, isopoda, oniscidea, the, woodlice, and, decapoda, terrestrial, hermit, crabs, crabs, of, the, families, ocypodidae, gecarcinidae, and, grapsidae, and, terrestrial, crayfish, they, are, abundant, in, all, marine, ecosystems, and, most, species, are, scavengers, although, some, such, as, the, porcelain, crabs, are, filter, feeders, and, some, such, as, mantis, shrimps, are, carnivores, most, species, of, malacostracans, have, distinct, sexes, a, phenomenon, known, as, gonochorism, although, a, few, species, exhibit, hermaphroditism, the, female, genital, openings, or, gonopores, are, located, on, the, sixth, thoracic, segment, or, its, appendages, while, the, male, gonopores, are, on, the, eighth, segment, or, its, appendages, or, in, a, small, number, of, species, on, the, seventh, the, naupliar, larval, stages, are, often, reduced, and, take, place, before, hatching, but, where, they, occur, a, metamorphosis, usually, occurs, between, the, larval, and, the, adult, forms, primitive, malacostracans, have, a, free, swimming, naupliar, larval, stage, research, suggests, the, common, ancestor, of, malacostraca, had, lost, the, free, living, nauplius, larval, stage, but, re, evolved, it, again, through, heterochrony, in, dendrobranchiata, and, euphausiacea, which, both, has, a, lecithotrophic, non, feeding, nauplius, stage, mating, behavior, has, been, studied, in, the, freshwater, shrimp, caridina, ensifera, multiple, paternity, common, in, the, malacostrica, also, occurs, in, c, ensifera, reproductive, success, of, sires, was, found, to, correlate, inversely, with, their, genetic, relatedness, to, the, mother, this, finding, suggests, that, sperm, competition, and, or, pre, and, post, copulatory, female, choice, occurs, female, choice, may, increase, the, fitness, of, progeny, by, avoiding, inbreeding, that, can, lead, to, expression, of, homozygous, deleterious, recessive, mutations, the, monophyly, of, malacostraca, is, widely, accepted, this, is, supported, by, several, common, morphological, traits, which, are, present, throughout, the, group, and, is, confirmed, by, molecular, studies, however, a, number, of, problems, make, it, difficult, to, determine, the, relationships, between, the, orders, of, malacostraca, these, include, differences, in, mutation, rates, in, different, lineages, different, patterns, of, evolution, being, apparent, in, different, sources, of, data, including, convergent, evolution, and, long, branch, attraction, there, is, less, agreement, on, the, status, of, the, subclass, phyllocarida, with, its, single, extant, order, leptostraca, depending, on, whether, foliaceous, leaf, like, limbs, have, a, single, or, multiple, origin, some, authors, advocate, placing, phyllocarida, in, phyllopoda, a, group, used, in, former, classification, systems, which, would, then, include, branchiopods, cephalocarids, and, leptostracans, a, molecular, study, by, american, biologists, trisha, spears, and, lawrence, abele, concluded, that, phylogenetic, evidence, did, not, support, the, monophyly, of, this, grouping, and, that, phyllocarida, should, be, regarded, as, a, subclass, of, malacostraca, that, had, diverged, from, the, main, lineage, at, an, early, date, the, following, cladogram, is, based, on, the, 2001, phylogenetic, analysis, of, richter, scholtz, phyllocarida, hoplocarida, decapoda, amphionidacea, euphausiacea, thermosbaenacea, mysida, lophogastrida, spelaeogriphacea, mictacea, cumacea, tanaidacea, isopoda, anaspidacea, bathynellacea, leptostraca, is, the, only, extant, order, of, phyllocarida, the, other, two, orders, archaeostraca, and, hoplostraca, being, extinct, leptostracans, are, thought, to, be, the, most, primitive, of, the, malacostracans, and, date, back, to, the, cambrian, period, they, range, in, length, from, 1, to, 4, cm, 0, 4, to, 1, 6, in, most, being, suspension, feeders, though, some, are, carnivores, or, scavengers, they, have, a, two, part, carapace, which, encloses, the, head, the, whole, thorax, and, part, of, the, abdomen, and, are, the, only, malacostracans, with, seven, abdominal, segments, three, families, are, known, with, several, genera, and, about, twenty, species, they, are, found, worldwide, from, the, intertidal, zone, to, the, deep, ocean, all, but, one, species, being, benthic, living, on, the, seabed, stomatopoda, is, the, only, extant, order, of, hoplocarida, the, other, two, orders, aeschronectida, and, archaeostomatopoda, being, extinct, stomatopodans, commonly, known, as, mantis, shrimps, range, in, length, from, 5, to, 36, cm, 2, to, 14, in, and, are, predators, they, have, a, dorso, ventrally, flattened, body, and, a, shield, like, carapace, and, are, armed, with, powerful, raptorial, claws, normally, carried, in, a, folded, position, there, are, about, 300, species, most, living, in, tropical, and, subtropical, seas, although, some, live, in, temperate, areas, they, are, benthic, mostly, hiding, in, cracks, and, crevices, or, living, in, burrows, some, emerging, to, forage, while, others, are, ambush, predators, the, eumalocostraca, contains, the, vast, majority, of, the, approximately, 40, 000, living, species, of, malacostracans, and, consists, of, three, superorders, syncarida, peracarida, and, eucarida, syncaridans, are, mostly, small, and, found, in, freshwater, and, subterranean, habitats, peracaridans, are, characterised, by, having, a, marsupium, in, which, they, brood, their, young, they, are, found, in, marine, freshwater, and, terrestrial, habitats, and, include, amphipoda, cumacea, isopoda, and, mysida, eucarida, includes, lobsters, crabs, shrimps, prawns, and, krill, the, first, malacostracans, appeared, sometime, in, the, cambrian, when, animals, belonging, to, the, phyllocarida, appeared, the, following, classification, of, living, malacostracans, is, based, on, an, updated, classification, of, the, recent, crustacea, 2001, by, the, american, marine, biologists, joel, w, martin, curator, of, crustaceans, at, the, natural, history, museum, of, los, angeles, county, and, george, e, davies, extinct, orders, have, been, added, to, this, and, are, indicated, by, an, obelisk, class, malacostraca, latreille, 1802
