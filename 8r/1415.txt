lyme, disease, also, known, as, lyme, borreliosis, is, a, tick, borne, disease, caused, by, species, of, borrelia, bacteria, transmitted, by, blood, feeding, ticks, in, the, genus, ixodes, the, most, common, sign, of, infection, is, an, expanding, red, rash, known, as, erythema, migrans, em, which, appears, at, the, site, of, the, tick, bite, about, a, week, afterwards, the, rash, is, typically, neither, itchy, nor, painful, approximately, 70, 80, of, infected, people, develop, a, rash, early, diagnosis, can, be, difficult, other, early, symptoms, may, include, fever, headaches, and, tiredness, if, untreated, symptoms, may, include, loss, of, the, ability, to, move, one, or, both, sides, of, the, face, joint, pains, severe, headaches, with, neck, stiffness, or, heart, palpitations, months, to, years, later, repeated, episodes, of, joint, pain, and, swelling, may, occur, occasionally, shooting, pains, or, tingling, in, the, arms, and, legs, may, develop, lyme, disease, is, transmitted, to, humans, by, the, bites, of, infected, ticks, of, the, genus, ixodes, in, the, united, states, ticks, of, concern, are, usually, of, the, ixodes, scapularis, type, according, to, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, in, most, cases, a, tick, must, be, attached, for, 36, to, 48, hours, or, more, before, the, lyme, disease, bacterium, can, be, transmitted, if, you, remove, a, tick, quickly, within, 24, hours, you, can, greatly, reduce, your, chances, of, getting, lyme, disease, in, europe, ixodes, ricinus, ticks, may, spread, the, bacteria, more, quickly, in, north, america, the, bacterial, species, borrelia, burgdorferi, and, b, mayonii, cause, lyme, disease, in, europe, and, asia, borrelia, afzelii, borrelia, garinii, b, spielmanii, and, four, other, species, also, cause, the, disease, the, disease, does, not, appear, to, be, transmissible, between, people, by, other, animals, nor, through, food, diagnosis, is, based, on, a, combination, of, symptoms, history, of, tick, exposure, and, possibly, testing, for, specific, antibodies, in, the, blood, blood, tests, are, often, falsely, negative, in, the, early, stages, of, the, disease, testing, of, individual, ticks, is, not, typically, useful, prevention, includes, efforts, to, prevent, tick, bites, by, wearing, clothing, to, cover, the, arms, and, legs, and, using, deet, or, picaridin, based, insect, repellents, using, pesticides, to, reduce, tick, numbers, may, also, be, effective, ticks, can, be, removed, using, tweezers, if, the, removed, tick, is, full, of, blood, a, single, dose, of, doxycycline, may, be, used, to, prevent, the, development, of, infection, but, is, not, generally, recommended, since, the, development, of, infection, is, rare, if, an, infection, develops, a, number, of, antibiotics, are, effective, including, doxycycline, amoxicillin, and, cefuroxime, standard, treatment, usually, lasts, for, two, or, three, weeks, some, people, develop, a, fever, and, muscle, and, joint, pains, from, treatment, which, may, last, for, one, or, two, days, in, those, who, develop, persistent, symptoms, long, term, antibiotic, therapy, has, not, been, found, to, be, useful, lyme, disease, is, the, most, common, disease, spread, by, ticks, in, the, northern, hemisphere, infections, are, most, common, in, the, spring, and, early, summer, lyme, disease, was, diagnosed, as, a, separate, condition, for, the, first, time, in, 1975, in, lyme, connecticut, it, was, originally, mistaken, for, juvenile, rheumatoid, arthritis, the, bacterium, involved, was, first, described, in, 1981, by, willy, burgdorfer, people, with, persistent, symptoms, after, appropriate, treatments, are, said, to, have, post, treatment, lyme, disease, syndrome, ptlds, ptlds, is, different, from, chronic, lyme, disease, a, term, no, longer, supported, by, scientists, and, used, in, different, ways, by, different, groups, some, healthcare, providers, claim, that, chronic, lyme, is, caused, by, persistent, infection, but, this, is, not, believed, to, be, true, because, no, evidence, of, persistent, infection, can, be, found, after, standard, treatment, as, of, 2023, clinical, trials, of, proposed, human, vaccines, for, lyme, disease, were, being, carried, out, but, no, vaccine, was, available, a, vaccine, lymerix, was, produced, but, discontinued, in, 2002, due, to, insufficient, demand, there, are, several, vaccines, for, the, prevention, of, lyme, disease, in, dogs, lyme, disease, can, produce, a, broad, range, of, symptoms, the, incubation, period, is, usually, one, to, two, weeks, but, can, be, much, shorter, days, or, much, longer, months, to, years, lyme, symptoms, most, often, occur, from, the, month, of, may, to, september, in, the, northern, hemisphere, because, the, nymphal, stage, of, the, tick, is, responsible, for, most, cases, 80, of, lyme, infections, begin, with, a, rash, of, some, sort, at, the, site, of, a, tick, bite, often, near, skin, folds, such, as, the, armpit, groin, back, of, the, knee, or, the, trunk, under, clothing, straps, or, in, children, s, hair, ears, or, neck, most, people, who, get, infected, do, not, remember, seeing, a, tick, or, a, bite, the, rash, appears, typically, one, or, two, weeks, range, 3, 32, days, after, the, bite, and, expands, 2, 3, cm, per, day, up, to, a, diameter, of, 5, 70, cm, median, is, 16, cm, the, rash, is, usually, circular, or, oval, red, or, bluish, and, may, have, an, elevated, or, darker, center, this, rash, is, termed, an, erythema, migrans, em, which, translates, as, migrating, redness, in, about, 79, of, cases, in, europe, this, rash, gradually, clears, from, the, center, toward, the, edges, possibly, forming, a, bull, s, eye, or, target, like, pattern, but, this, clearing, only, happens, in, 19, of, cases, in, endemic, areas, of, the, united, states, the, rash, may, feel, warm, usually, is, not, itchy, is, rarely, tender, or, painful, and, takes, up, to, four, weeks, to, resolve, if, untreated, the, lyme, rash, is, often, accompanied, by, symptoms, of, a, flu, like, illness, including, fatigue, headache, body, aches, fever, and, chills, these, symptoms, may, also, appear, without, a, rash, or, linger, after, the, rash, has, disappeared, lyme, can, progress, to, later, stages, without, a, rash, or, these, symptoms, people, with, high, fever, for, more, than, two, days, or, whose, other, symptoms, of, viral, like, illness, do, not, improve, despite, antibiotic, treatment, for, lyme, disease, or, who, have, abnormally, low, levels, of, white, or, red, cells, or, platelets, in, the, blood, should, be, investigated, for, possible, coinfection, with, other, tick, borne, diseases, such, as, ehrlichiosis, and, babesiosis, not, everyone, with, lyme, disease, has, all, the, symptoms, and, many, of, these, symptoms, can, also, occur, with, other, diseases, asymptomatic, infection, exists, but, occurs, in, less, than, 7, of, infected, individuals, in, the, united, states, asymptomatic, infection, may, be, much, more, common, among, those, infected, in, europe, within, days, to, weeks, after, the, onset, of, local, infection, the, borrelia, bacteria, may, spread, through, the, lymphatic, system, or, bloodstream, in, 10, 20, of, untreated, cases, em, rashes, develop, at, sites, across, the, body, that, bear, no, relation, to, the, original, tick, bite, transient, muscle, pains, and, joint, pains, are, also, common, in, about, 10, 15, of, untreated, people, lyme, causes, neurological, problems, known, as, neuroborreliosis, early, neuroborreliosis, typically, appears, 4, 6, weeks, range, 1, 12, weeks, after, the, tick, bite, and, involves, some, combination, of, lymphocytic, meningitis, cranial, neuritis, radiculopathy, and, or, mononeuritis, multiplex, lymphocytic, meningitis, causes, characteristic, changes, in, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, csf, and, may, be, accompanied, for, several, weeks, by, variable, headache, and, less, commonly, usually, mild, meningitis, signs, such, as, inability, to, flex, the, neck, fully, and, intolerance, to, bright, lights, but, typically, no, or, only, very, low, fever, after, several, months, neuroborreliosis, can, also, present, otolaryngological, symptoms, up, to, 76, 5, of, them, present, as, tinnitus, the, most, common, symptom, vertigo, and, dizziness, 53, 7, and, hearing, loss, 16, 7, were, the, next, most, common, symptoms, in, children, partial, loss, of, vision, may, also, occur, cranial, neuritis, is, an, inflammation, of, cranial, nerves, when, due, to, lyme, it, most, typically, causes, facial, palsy, impairing, blinking, smiling, and, chewing, on, one, or, both, sides, of, the, face, it, may, also, cause, intermittent, double, vision, lyme, radiculopathy, is, an, inflammation, of, spinal, nerve, roots, that, often, causes, pain, and, less, often, weakness, numbness, or, altered, sensation, in, the, areas, of, the, body, served, by, nerves, connected, to, the, affected, roots, e, g, limb, s, or, part, s, of, trunk, the, pain, is, often, described, as, unlike, any, other, previously, felt, excruciating, migrating, worse, at, night, rarely, symmetrical, and, often, accompanied, by, extreme, sleep, disturbance, mononeuritis, multiplex, is, an, inflammation, causing, similar, symptoms, in, one, or, more, unrelated, peripheral, nerves, rarely, early, neuroborreliosis, may, involve, inflammation, of, the, brain, or, spinal, cord, with, symptoms, such, as, confusion, abnormal, gait, ocular, movements, or, speech, impaired, movement, impaired, motor, planning, or, shaking, in, north, america, facial, palsy, is, the, typical, early, neuroborreliosis, presentation, occurring, in, 5, 10, of, untreated, people, in, about, 75, of, cases, accompanied, by, lymphocytic, meningitis, lyme, radiculopathy, is, reported, half, as, frequently, but, many, cases, may, be, unrecognized, in, european, adults, the, most, common, presentation, is, a, combination, of, lymphocytic, meningitis, and, radiculopathy, known, as, bannwarth, syndrome, accompanied, in, 36, 89, of, cases, by, facial, palsy, in, this, syndrome, radicular, pain, tends, to, start, in, the, same, body, region, as, the, initial, erythema, migrans, rash, if, there, was, one, and, precedes, possible, facial, palsy, and, other, impaired, movement, in, extreme, cases, permanent, impairment, of, motor, or, sensory, function, of, the, lower, limbs, may, occur, in, european, children, the, most, common, manifestations, are, facial, palsy, in, 55, other, cranial, neuritis, and, lymphocytic, meningitis, in, 27, in, about, 4, 10, of, untreated, cases, in, the, united, states, and, 0, 3, 4, of, untreated, cases, in, europe, typically, between, june, and, december, about, one, month, range, 4, days, to, 7, months, after, the, tick, bite, the, infection, may, cause, heart, complications, known, as, lyme, carditis, symptoms, may, include, heart, palpitations, in, 69, of, people, dizziness, fainting, shortness, of, breath, and, chest, pain, other, symptoms, of, lyme, disease, may, also, be, present, such, as, em, rash, joint, aches, facial, palsy, headaches, or, radicular, pain, in, some, people, however, carditis, may, be, the, first, manifestation, of, lyme, disease, lyme, carditis, in, 19, 87, of, people, adversely, impacts, the, heart, s, electrical, conduction, system, causing, atrioventricular, block, that, often, manifests, as, heart, rhythms, that, alternate, within, minutes, between, abnormally, slow, and, abnormally, fast, in, 10, 15, of, people, lyme, causes, myocardial, complications, such, as, cardiomegaly, left, ventricular, dysfunction, or, congestive, heart, failure, another, skin, condition, found, in, europe, but, not, in, north, america, is, borrelial, lymphocytoma, a, purplish, lump, that, develops, on, the, ear, lobe, nipple, or, scrotum, lyme, arthritis, occurs, in, up, to, 60, of, untreated, people, typically, starting, about, six, months, after, infection, it, usually, affects, only, one, or, a, few, joints, often, a, knee, or, possibly, the, hip, other, large, joints, or, the, temporomandibular, joint, usually, large, joint, effusion, and, swelling, occur, but, only, mild, or, moderate, pain, without, treatment, swelling, and, pain, typically, resolve, over, time, but, periodically, return, baker, s, cysts, may, form, and, rupture, in, early, us, studies, of, lyme, disease, a, rare, peripheral, neuropathy, was, described, that, included, numbness, tingling, or, burning, starting, at, the, feet, or, hands, and, over, time, possibly, moving, up, the, limbs, in, a, later, analysis, that, discovered, poor, documentation, of, this, manifestation, experts, wondered, if, it, exists, at, all, in, the, us, or, is, merely, very, rare, a, neurologic, syndrome, called, lyme, encephalopathy, is, associated, with, subtle, memory, and, cognitive, difficulties, insomnia, a, general, sense, of, feeling, unwell, and, changes, in, personality, lyme, encephalopathy, is, controversial, in, the, us, and, has, not, been, reported, in, europe, problems, such, as, depression, and, fibromyalgia, are, as, common, in, people, with, lyme, disease, as, in, the, general, population, there, is, no, compelling, evidence, that, lyme, disease, causes, psychiatric, disorders, behavioral, disorders, e, g, adhd, or, developmental, disorders, e, g, autism, acrodermatitis, chronica, atrophicans, is, a, chronic, skin, disorder, observed, primarily, in, europe, among, the, elderly, it, begins, as, a, reddish, blue, patch, of, discolored, skin, often, on, the, backs, of, the, hands, or, feet, the, lesion, slowly, atrophies, over, several, weeks, or, months, with, the, skin, becoming, first, thin, and, wrinkled, and, then, if, untreated, completely, dry, and, hairless, it, is, also, associated, with, peripheral, neuropathy, lyme, disease, is, caused, by, spirochetes, gram, negative, bacteria, from, the, genus, borrelia, spirochetes, are, surrounded, by, peptidoglycan, and, flagella, the, lyme, related, borrelia, species, are, collectively, known, as, borrelia, burgdorferi, sensu, lato, and, show, a, great, deal, of, genetic, diversity, b, burgdorferi, sensu, lato, is, a, species, complex, made, up, of, 20, accepted, and, three, proposed, genospecies, eight, species, are, known, to, cause, lyme, disease, b, mayonii, found, in, north, america, b, burgdorferi, sensu, stricto, found, in, north, america, and, europe, b, afzelii, b, garinii, b, spielmanii, and, b, lusitaniae, all, found, in, eurasia, some, studies, have, also, proposed, that, b, valaisiana, may, sometimes, infect, humans, but, this, species, does, not, seem, to, be, an, important, cause, of, disease, three, stages, occur, in, the, life, cycle, of, a, tick, larva, nymph, and, adult, during, the, nymph, stage, ticks, most, frequently, transmit, lyme, disease, and, are, usually, most, active, in, late, spring, and, early, summer, in, regions, where, the, climate, is, mild, during, the, adult, stage, lyme, disease, transmission, is, less, common, because, adult, ticks, are, less, likely, to, bite, humans, and, tend, to, be, larger, in, size, so, can, be, easily, seen, and, removed, lyme, disease, is, classified, as, a, zoonosis, as, it, is, transmitted, to, humans, from, a, natural, reservoir, among, small, mammals, and, birds, by, ticks, that, feed, on, both, sets, of, hosts, hard, bodied, ticks, of, the, genus, ixodes, are, the, vectors, of, lyme, disease, also, the, vector, for, babesia, most, infections, are, caused, by, ticks, in, the, nymphal, stage, because, they, are, very, small, thus, may, feed, for, long, periods, of, time, undetected, nymphal, ticks, are, generally, the, size, of, a, poppy, seed, and, sometimes, with, a, dark, head, and, a, translucent, body, or, the, nymphal, ticks, can, be, darker, the, younger, larval, ticks, are, very, rarely, infected, although, deer, are, the, preferred, hosts, of, adult, deer, ticks, and, tick, populations, are, much, lower, in, the, absence, of, deer, ticks, generally, do, not, acquire, borrelia, from, deer, instead, they, obtain, them, from, infected, small, mammals, such, as, the, white, footed, mouse, and, occasionally, birds, areas, where, lyme, is, common, are, expanding, within, the, tick, midgut, the, borrelia, s, outer, surface, protein, a, ospa, binds, to, the, tick, receptor, for, ospa, known, as, trospa, when, the, tick, feeds, the, borrelia, downregulates, ospa, and, upregulates, ospc, another, surface, protein, after, the, bacteria, migrate, from, the, midgut, to, the, salivary, glands, ospc, binds, to, salp15, a, tick, salivary, protein, that, appears, to, have, immunosuppressive, effects, that, enhance, infection, successful, infection, of, the, mammalian, host, depends, on, bacterial, expression, of, ospc, tick, bites, often, go, unnoticed, because, of, the, small, size, of, the, tick, in, its, nymphal, stage, as, well, as, tick, secretions, that, prevent, the, host, from, feeling, any, itch, or, pain, from, the, bite, however, transmission, is, quite, rare, with, only, about, 1, 2, to, 1, 4, percent, of, recognized, tick, bites, resulting, in, lyme, disease, while, b, burgdorferi, is, most, associated, with, ticks, hosted, by, white, tailed, deer, and, white, footed, mice, borrelia, afzelii, is, most, frequently, detected, in, rodent, feeding, vector, ticks, and, borrelia, garinii, and, borrelia, valaisiana, appear, to, be, associated, with, birds, both, rodents, and, birds, are, competent, reservoir, hosts, for, b, burgdorferi, sensu, stricto, the, resistance, of, a, genospecies, of, lyme, disease, spirochetes, to, the, bacteriolytic, activities, of, the, alternative, complement, pathway, of, various, host, species, may, determine, its, reservoir, host, association, budding, research, has, suggested, that, b, burgdorferi, sensu, lato, may, also, be, able, to, form, enzootic, cycle, among, lizard, populations, this, was, previously, assumed, not, to, be, possible, in, major, areas, containing, populations, of, lizards, such, as, california, except, for, one, study, in, europe, much, of, the, data, implicating, lizards, is, based, on, dna, detection, of, the, spirochete, and, has, not, demonstrated, that, lizards, are, able, to, infect, ticks, feeding, upon, them, as, some, experiments, suggest, lizards, are, refractory, to, infection, with, borrelia, it, appears, likely, their, involvement, in, the, enzootic, cycle, is, more, complex, and, species, specific, in, europe, the, main, vector, is, ixodes, ricinus, which, is, also, called, the, sheep, tick, or, castor, bean, tick, in, china, ixodes, persulcatus, the, taiga, tick, is, probably, the, most, important, vector, in, north, america, the, black, legged, tick, or, deer, tick, ixodes, scapularis, is, the, main, vector, on, the, east, coast, the, lone, star, tick, amblyomma, americanum, which, is, found, throughout, the, southeastern, united, states, as, far, west, as, texas, is, unlikely, to, transmit, the, lyme, disease, spirochetes, though, it, may, be, implicated, in, a, related, syndrome, called, southern, tick, associated, rash, illness, which, resembles, a, mild, form, of, lyme, disease, on, the, west, coast, of, the, united, states, the, main, vector, is, the, western, black, legged, tick, ixodes, pacificus, the, tendency, of, this, tick, species, to, feed, predominantly, on, host, species, such, as, the, western, fence, lizard, that, are, resistant, to, borrelia, infection, appears, to, diminish, transmission, of, lyme, disease, in, the, west, transmission, can, occur, across, the, placenta, during, pregnancy, and, as, with, a, number, of, other, spirochetal, diseases, adverse, pregnancy, outcomes, are, possible, with, untreated, infection, prompt, treatment, with, antibiotics, reduces, or, eliminates, this, risk, there, is, no, scientific, evidence, to, support, lyme, disease, transmission, via, blood, transfusion, sexual, contact, or, breast, milk, ticks, that, transmit, b, burgdorferi, to, humans, can, also, carry, and, transmit, several, other, microbes, such, as, babesia, microti, and, anaplasma, phagocytophilum, which, cause, the, diseases, babesiosis, and, human, granulocytic, anaplasmosis, hga, respectively, among, people, with, early, lyme, disease, depending, on, their, location, 2, 12, will, also, have, hga, and, 2, 10, will, have, babesiosis, ticks, in, certain, regions, also, transmit, viruses, that, cause, tick, borne, encephalitis, and, powassan, virus, disease, co, infections, of, lyme, disease, may, not, require, additional, treatment, since, they, may, resolve, on, their, own, or, as, in, the, case, of, hga, can, be, treated, with, the, doxycycline, prescribed, for, lyme, persistent, fever, or, compatible, anomalous, laboratory, findings, may, be, indicative, of, a, co, infection, b, burgdorferi, can, spread, throughout, the, body, during, the, course, of, the, disease, and, has, been, found, in, the, skin, heart, joints, peripheral, nervous, system, and, central, nervous, system, b, burgdorferi, does, not, produce, toxins, therefore, many, of, the, signs, and, symptoms, of, lyme, disease, are, a, consequence, of, the, immune, response, to, spirochete, in, those, tissues, b, burgdorferi, is, injected, into, the, skin, by, the, bite, of, an, infected, ixodes, tick, tick, saliva, which, accompanies, the, spirochete, into, the, skin, during, the, feeding, process, contains, substances, that, disrupt, the, immune, response, at, the, site, of, the, bite, this, provides, a, protective, environment, where, the, spirochete, can, establish, infection, the, spirochetes, multiply, and, migrate, outward, within, the, dermis, the, host, inflammatory, response, to, the, bacteria, in, the, skin, causes, the, characteristic, circular, em, lesion, neutrophils, however, which, are, necessary, to, eliminate, the, spirochetes, from, the, skin, fail, to, appear, in, necessary, numbers, in, the, developing, em, lesion, because, tick, saliva, inhibits, neutrophil, function, this, allows, the, bacteria, to, survive, and, eventually, spread, throughout, the, body, days, to, weeks, following, the, tick, bite, the, spirochetes, spread, via, the, bloodstream, to, joints, heart, nervous, system, and, distant, skin, sites, where, their, presence, gives, rise, to, the, variety, of, symptoms, of, the, disseminated, disease, the, spread, of, b, burgdorferi, is, aided, by, the, attachment, of, the, host, protease, plasmin, to, the, surface, of, the, spirochete, if, untreated, the, bacteria, may, persist, in, the, body, for, months, or, even, years, despite, the, production, of, b, burgdorferi, antibodies, by, the, immune, system, the, spirochetes, may, avoid, the, immune, response, by, decreasing, expression, of, surface, proteins, that, are, targeted, by, antibodies, antigenic, variation, of, the, vlse, surface, protein, inactivating, key, immune, components, such, as, complement, and, hiding, in, the, extracellular, matrix, which, may, interfere, with, the, function, of, immune, factors, exposure, to, the, borrelia, bacterium, during, lyme, disease, possibly, causes, a, long, lived, and, damaging, inflammatory, response, a, form, of, pathogen, induced, autoimmune, disease, the, production, of, this, reaction, might, be, due, to, a, form, of, molecular, mimicry, where, borrelia, avoids, being, killed, by, the, immune, system, by, resembling, normal, parts, of, the, body, s, tissues, chronic, symptoms, from, an, autoimmune, reaction, could, explain, why, some, symptoms, persist, even, after, the, spirochetes, have, been, eliminated, from, the, body, this, hypothesis, may, explain, why, chronic, arthritis, persists, after, antibiotic, therapy, similar, to, rheumatic, fever, but, its, wider, application, is, controversial, lyme, disease, is, diagnosed, based, on, symptoms, objective, physical, findings, such, as, erythema, migrans, em, rash, facial, palsy, or, arthritis, history, of, possible, exposure, to, infected, ticks, and, possibly, laboratory, tests, people, with, symptoms, of, early, lyme, disease, should, have, a, total, body, skin, examination, for, em, rashes, and, asked, whether, em, type, rashes, had, manifested, within, the, last, 1, 2, months, presence, of, an, em, rash, and, recent, tick, exposure, i, e, being, outdoors, in, a, likely, tick, habitat, where, lyme, is, common, within, 30, days, of, the, appearance, of, the, rash, are, sufficient, for, lyme, diagnosis, no, laboratory, confirmation, is, needed, or, recommended, most, people, who, get, infected, do, not, remember, a, tick, or, a, bite, and, the, em, rash, need, not, look, like, a, bull, s, eye, most, em, rashes, in, the, u, s, do, not, or, be, accompanied, by, any, other, symptoms, in, the, u, s, lyme, is, most, common, in, the, new, england, and, mid, atlantic, states, and, parts, of, wisconsin, and, minnesota, but, it, is, expanding, into, other, areas, several, bordering, areas, of, canada, also, have, high, lyme, risk, in, the, absence, of, an, em, rash, or, history, of, tick, exposure, lyme, diagnosis, depends, on, laboratory, confirmation, the, bacteria, that, cause, lyme, disease, are, difficult, to, observe, directly, in, body, tissues, and, also, difficult, and, too, time, consuming, to, grow, in, the, laboratory, the, most, widely, used, tests, look, instead, for, presence, of, antibodies, against, those, bacteria, in, the, blood, a, positive, antibody, test, result, does, not, by, itself, prove, active, infection, but, can, confirm, an, infection, that, is, suspected, because, of, symptoms, objective, findings, and, history, of, tick, exposure, in, a, person, because, as, many, as, 5, 20, of, the, normal, population, have, antibodies, against, lyme, people, without, history, and, symptoms, suggestive, of, lyme, disease, should, not, be, tested, for, lyme, antibodies, a, positive, result, would, likely, be, false, possibly, causing, unnecessary, treatment, in, some, cases, when, history, signs, and, symptoms, are, strongly, suggestive, of, early, disseminated, lyme, disease, empiric, treatment, may, be, started, and, reevaluated, as, laboratory, test, results, become, available, tests, for, antibodies, in, the, blood, by, elisa, and, western, blot, is, the, most, widely, used, method, for, lyme, diagnosis, a, two, tiered, protocol, is, recommended, by, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, the, sensitive, elisa, test, is, performed, first, and, if, it, is, positive, or, equivocal, then, the, more, specific, western, blot, is, run, the, immune, system, takes, some, time, to, produce, antibodies, in, quantity, after, lyme, infection, onset, antibodies, of, types, igm, and, igg, usually, can, first, be, detected, respectively, at, 2, 4, weeks, and, 4, 6, weeks, and, peak, at, 6, 8, weeks, when, an, em, rash, first, appears, detectable, antibodies, may, not, be, present, therefore, it, is, recommended, that, testing, not, be, performed, and, diagnosis, be, based, on, the, presence, of, the, em, rash, up, to, 30, days, after, suspected, lyme, infection, onset, infection, can, be, confirmed, by, detection, of, igm, or, igg, antibodies, after, that, it, is, recommended, that, only, igg, antibodies, be, considered, a, positive, igm, and, negative, igg, test, result, after, the, first, month, of, infection, is, generally, indicative, of, a, false, positive, result, the, number, of, igm, antibodies, usually, collapses, 4, 6, months, after, infection, while, igg, antibodies, can, remain, detectable, for, years, other, tests, may, be, used, in, neuroborreliosis, cases, in, europe, neuroborreliosis, is, usually, caused, by, borrelia, garinii, and, almost, always, involves, lymphocytic, pleocytosis, i, e, the, densities, of, lymphocytes, infection, fighting, cells, and, protein, in, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, csf, typically, rise, to, characteristically, abnormal, levels, while, glucose, level, remains, normal, additionally, the, immune, system, produces, antibodies, against, lyme, inside, the, intrathecal, space, which, contains, the, csf, demonstration, by, lumbar, puncture, and, csf, analysis, of, pleocytosis, and, intrathecal, antibody, production, are, required, for, definite, diagnosis, of, neuroborreliosis, in, europe, except, in, cases, of, peripheral, neuropathy, associated, with, acrodermatitis, chronica, atrophicans, which, usually, is, caused, by, borrelia, afzelii, and, confirmed, by, blood, antibody, tests, in, north, america, neuroborreliosis, is, caused, by, borrelia, burgdorferi, and, may, not, be, accompanied, by, the, same, csf, signs, they, confirm, a, diagnosis, of, central, nervous, system, cns, neuroborreliosis, if, positive, but, do, not, exclude, it, if, negative, american, guidelines, consider, csf, analysis, optional, when, symptoms, appear, to, be, confined, to, the, peripheral, nervous, system, pns, e, g, facial, palsy, without, overt, meningitis, symptoms, unlike, blood, and, intrathecal, antibody, tests, csf, pleocytosis, tests, revert, to, normal, after, infection, ends, and, therefore, can, be, used, as, objective, markers, of, treatment, success, and, inform, decisions, on, whether, to, retreat, in, infection, involving, the, pns, electromyography, and, nerve, conduction, studies, can, be, used, to, monitor, objectively, the, response, to, treatment, in, lyme, carditis, electrocardiograms, are, used, to, evidence, heart, conduction, abnormalities, while, echocardiography, may, show, myocardial, dysfunction, biopsy, and, confirmation, of, borrelia, cells, in, myocardial, tissue, may, be, used, in, specific, cases, but, are, usually, not, done, because, of, risk, of, the, procedure, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, tests, for, lyme, disease, have, also, been, developed, to, detect, the, genetic, material, dna, of, the, lyme, disease, spirochete, culture, or, pcr, are, the, current, means, for, detecting, the, presence, of, the, organism, as, serologic, studies, only, test, for, antibodies, of, borrelia, pcr, has, the, advantage, of, being, much, faster, than, culture, however, pcr, tests, are, susceptible, to, false, positive, results, e, g, by, detection, of, debris, of, dead, borrelia, cells, or, specimen, contamination, even, when, properly, performed, pcr, often, shows, false, negative, results, because, few, borrelia, cells, can, be, found, in, blood, and, cerebrospinal, fluid, csf, during, infection, hence, pcr, tests, are, recommended, only, in, special, cases, e, g, diagnosis, of, lyme, arthritis, because, it, is, a, highly, sensitive, way, of, detecting, ospa, dna, in, synovial, fluid, although, sensitivity, of, pcr, in, csf, is, low, its, use, may, be, considered, when, intrathecal, antibody, production, test, results, are, suspected, of, being, falsely, negative, e, g, in, very, early, 6, weeks, neuroborreliosis, or, in, immunosuppressed, people, several, other, forms, of, laboratory, testing, for, lyme, disease, are, available, some, of, which, have, not, been, adequately, validated, ospa, antigens, shed, by, live, borrelia, bacteria, into, urine, are, a, promising, technique, being, studied, the, use, of, nanotrap, particles, for, their, detection, is, being, looked, at, and, the, ospa, has, been, linked, to, active, symptoms, of, lyme, high, titers, of, either, immunoglobulin, g, igg, or, immunoglobulin, m, igm, antibodies, to, borrelia, antigens, indicate, disease, but, lower, titers, can, be, misleading, because, the, igm, antibodies, may, remain, after, the, initial, infection, and, igg, antibodies, may, remain, for, years, the, cdc, does, not, recommend, urine, antigen, tests, pcr, tests, on, urine, immunofluorescent, staining, for, cell, wall, deficient, forms, of, b, burgdorferi, and, lymphocyte, transformation, tests, neuroimaging, is, controversial, in, whether, it, provides, specific, patterns, unique, to, neuroborreliosis, but, may, aid, in, differential, diagnosis, and, in, understanding, the, pathophysiology, of, the, disease, though, controversial, some, evidence, shows, certain, neuroimaging, tests, can, provide, data, that, are, helpful, in, the, diagnosis, of, a, person, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, and, single, photon, emission, computed, tomography, spect, are, two, of, the, tests, that, can, identify, abnormalities, in, the, brain, of, a, person, affected, with, this, disease, neuroimaging, findings, in, an, mri, include, lesions, in, the, periventricular, white, matter, as, well, as, enlarged, ventricles, and, cortical, atrophy, the, findings, are, considered, somewhat, unexceptional, because, the, lesions, have, been, found, to, be, reversible, following, antibiotic, treatment, images, produced, using, spect, show, numerous, areas, where, an, insufficient, amount, of, blood, is, being, delivered, to, the, cortex, and, subcortical, white, matter, however, spect, images, are, known, to, be, nonspecific, because, they, show, a, heterogeneous, pattern, in, the, imaging, the, abnormalities, seen, in, the, spect, images, are, very, similar, to, those, seen, in, people, with, cerebral, vasculitis, and, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, which, makes, them, questionable, community, clinics, have, been, reported, to, misdiagnose, 23, 28, of, erythema, migrans, em, rashes, and, 83, of, other, objective, manifestations, of, early, lyme, disease, em, rashes, are, often, misdiagnosed, as, spider, bites, cellulitis, or, shingles, many, misdiagnoses, are, credited, to, the, widespread, misconception, that, em, rashes, should, look, like, a, bull, s, eye, actually, the, key, distinguishing, features, of, the, em, rash, are, the, speed, and, extent, to, which, it, expands, respectively, up, to, 2, 3, cm, day, and, a, diameter, of, at, least, 5, cm, and, in, 50, of, cases, more, than, 16, cm, the, rash, expands, away, from, its, center, which, may, or, may, not, look, different, or, be, separated, by, ring, like, clearing, from, the, rest, of, the, rash, compared, to, em, rashes, spider, bites, are, more, common, in, the, limbs, tend, to, be, more, painful, and, itchy, or, become, swollen, and, some, may, cause, necrosis, sinking, dark, blue, patch, of, dead, skin, cellulitis, most, commonly, develops, around, a, wound, or, ulcer, is, rarely, circular, and, is, more, likely, to, become, swollen, and, tender, em, rashes, often, appear, at, sites, that, are, unusual, for, cellulitis, such, as, the, armpit, groin, abdomen, or, back, of, knee, like, lyme, shingles, often, begins, with, headache, fever, and, fatigue, which, are, followed, by, pain, or, numbness, however, unlike, lyme, in, shingles, these, symptoms, are, usually, followed, by, appearance, of, rashes, composed, of, multiple, small, blisters, along, with, a, nerve, s, dermatome, and, shingles, can, also, be, confirmed, by, quick, laboratory, tests, facial, palsy, caused, by, lyme, disease, ldfp, is, often, misdiagnosed, as, bell, s, palsy, although, bell, s, palsy, is, the, most, common, type, of, one, sided, facial, palsy, about, 70, of, cases, ldfp, can, account, for, about, 25, of, cases, of, facial, palsy, in, areas, where, lyme, disease, is, common, compared, to, ldfp, bell, s, palsy, much, less, frequently, affects, both, sides, of, the, face, even, though, ldfp, and, bell, s, palsy, have, similar, symptoms, and, evolve, similarly, if, untreated, corticosteroid, treatment, is, beneficial, for, bell, s, palsy, while, being, detrimental, for, ldfp, recent, history, of, exposure, to, a, likely, tick, habitat, during, warmer, months, em, rash, viral, like, symptoms, such, as, headache, and, fever, and, or, palsy, in, both, sides, of, the, face, should, be, evaluated, for, the, likelihood, of, ldfp, if, it, is, more, than, minimal, empiric, therapy, with, antibiotics, should, be, initiated, without, corticosteroids, and, reevaluated, upon, completion, of, laboratory, tests, for, lyme, disease, unlike, viral, meningitis, lyme, lymphocytic, meningitis, tends, to, not, cause, fever, last, longer, and, recur, lymphocytic, meningitis, is, also, characterized, by, possibly, co, occurring, with, em, rash, facial, palsy, or, partial, vision, obstruction, and, having, much, lower, percentage, of, polymorphonuclear, leukocytes, in, csf, lyme, radiculopathy, affecting, the, limbs, is, often, misdiagnosed, as, a, radiculopathy, caused, by, nerve, root, compression, such, as, sciatica, although, most, cases, of, radiculopathy, are, compressive, and, resolve, with, conservative, treatment, e, g, rest, within, 4, 6, weeks, guidelines, for, managing, radiculopathy, recommend, first, evaluating, risks, of, other, possible, causes, that, although, less, frequent, require, immediate, diagnosis, and, treatment, including, infections, such, as, lyme, and, shingles, a, history, of, outdoor, activities, in, likely, tick, habitats, in, the, last, 3, months, possibly, followed, by, a, rash, or, viral, like, symptoms, and, current, headache, other, symptoms, of, lymphocytic, meningitis, or, facial, palsy, would, lead, to, suspicion, of, lyme, disease, and, recommendation, of, serological, and, lumbar, puncture, tests, for, confirmation, lyme, radiculopathy, affecting, the, trunk, can, be, misdiagnosed, as, myriad, other, conditions, such, as, diverticulitis, and, acute, coronary, syndrome, diagnosis, of, late, stage, lyme, disease, is, often, complicated, by, a, multifaceted, appearance, and, nonspecific, symptoms, prompting, one, reviewer, to, call, lyme, the, new, great, imitator, as, all, people, with, later, stage, infection, will, have, a, positive, antibody, test, simple, blood, tests, can, exclude, lyme, disease, as, a, possible, cause, of, a, person, s, symptoms, tick, bites, may, be, prevented, by, avoiding, or, reducing, time, in, likely, tick, habitats, and, taking, precautions, while, in, and, when, getting, out, of, one, most, lyme, human, infections, are, caused, by, ixodes, nymph, bites, between, april, and, september, ticks, prefer, moist, shaded, locations, in, woodlands, shrubs, tall, grasses, and, leaf, litter, or, wood, piles, tick, densities, tend, to, be, highest, in, woodlands, followed, by, unmaintained, edges, between, woods, and, lawns, about, half, as, high, ornamental, plants, and, perennial, groundcover, about, a, quarter, and, lawns, about, 30, times, less, ixodes, larvae, and, nymphs, tend, to, be, abundant, also, where, mice, nest, such, as, stone, walls, and, wood, logs, ixodes, larvae, and, nymphs, typically, wait, for, potential, hosts, quest, on, leaves, or, grasses, close, to, the, ground, with, forelegs, outstretched, when, a, host, brushes, against, its, limbs, the, tick, rapidly, clings, and, climbs, on, the, host, looking, for, a, skin, location, to, bite, in, northeastern, united, states, 69, of, tick, bites, are, estimated, to, happen, in, residences, 11, in, schools, or, camps, 9, in, parks, or, recreational, areas, 4, at, work, 3, while, hunting, and, 4, in, other, areas, activities, associated, with, tick, bites, around, residences, include, yard, work, brush, clearing, gardening, playing, in, the, yard, and, letting, dogs, or, cats, that, roam, outside, in, woody, or, grassy, areas, into, the, house, in, parks, tick, bites, often, happen, while, hiking, or, camping, walking, on, a, mown, lawn, or, center, of, a, trail, without, touching, adjacent, vegetation, is, less, risky, than, crawling, or, sitting, on, a, log, or, stone, wall, pets, should, not, be, allowed, to, roam, freely, in, likely, tick, habitats, as, a, precaution, cdc, recommends, soaking, or, spraying, clothes, shoes, and, camping, gear, such, as, tents, backpacks, and, sleeping, bags, with, 0, 5, permethrin, solution, and, hanging, them, to, dry, before, use, permethrin, is, odorless, and, safe, for, humans, but, highly, toxic, to, ticks, after, crawling, on, permethrin, treated, fabric, for, as, few, as, 10, 20, seconds, tick, nymphs, become, irritated, and, fall, off, or, die, permethrin, treated, closed, toed, shoes, and, socks, reduce, by, 74, times, the, number, of, bites, from, nymphs, that, make, first, contact, with, a, shoe, of, a, person, also, wearing, treated, shorts, because, nymphs, usually, quest, near, the, ground, this, is, a, typical, contact, scenario, better, protection, can, be, achieved, by, tucking, permethrin, treated, trousers, pants, into, treated, socks, and, a, treated, long, sleeve, shirt, into, the, trousers, so, as, to, minimize, gaps, through, which, a, tick, might, reach, the, wearer, s, skin, light, colored, clothing, may, make, it, easier, to, see, ticks, and, remove, them, before, they, bite, military, and, outdoor, workers, uniforms, treated, with, permethrin, have, been, found, to, reduce, the, number, of, bite, cases, by, 80, 95, permethrin, protection, lasts, several, weeks, of, wear, and, washings, in, customer, treated, items, and, up, to, 70, washings, for, factory, treated, items, permethrin, should, not, be, used, on, human, skin, underwear, or, cats, the, epa, recommends, several, tick, repellents, for, use, on, exposed, skin, including, deet, picaridin, ir3535, a, derivative, of, amino, acid, beta, alanine, oil, of, lemon, eucalyptus, ole, a, natural, compound, and, ole, s, active, ingredient, para, menthane, diol, pmd, unlike, permethrin, repellents, repel, but, do, not, kill, ticks, protect, for, only, several, hours, after, application, and, may, be, washed, off, by, sweat, or, water, the, most, popular, repellent, is, deet, in, the, u, s, and, picaridin, in, europe, unlike, deet, picaridin, is, odorless, and, is, less, likely, to, irritate, the, skin, or, harm, fabric, or, plastics, repellents, with, higher, concentration, may, last, longer, but, are, not, more, effective, against, ticks, 20, picaridin, may, work, for, 8, hours, vs, 55, 98, 11, deet, for, 5, 6, hours, or, 30, 40, ole, for, 6, hours, repellents, should, not, be, used, under, clothes, on, eyes, mouth, wounds, or, cuts, or, on, babies, younger, than, 2, months, 3, years, for, ole, or, pmd, if, sunscreen, is, used, repellent, should, be, applied, on, top, of, it, repellents, should, not, be, sprayed, directly, on, a, face, but, should, instead, be, sprayed, on, a, hand, and, then, rubbed, on, the, face, after, coming, indoors, clothes, gear, and, pets, should, be, checked, for, ticks, clothes, can, be, put, into, a, hot, dryer, for, 10, minutes, to, kill, ticks, just, washing, or, warm, dryer, are, not, enough, showering, as, soon, as, possible, looking, for, ticks, over, the, entire, body, and, removing, them, reduce, risk, of, infection, unfed, tick, nymphs, are, the, size, of, a, poppy, seed, but, a, day, or, two, after, biting, and, attaching, themselves, to, a, person, they, look, like, a, small, blood, blister, the, following, areas, should, be, checked, especially, carefully, armpits, between, legs, back, of, knee, bellybutton, trunk, and, in, children, ears, neck, and, hair, attached, ticks, should, be, removed, promptly, risk, of, infection, increases, with, time, of, attachment, but, in, north, america, risk, of, lyme, disease, is, small, if, the, tick, is, removed, within, 36, hours, cdc, recommends, inserting, a, fine, tipped, tweezer, between, the, skin, and, the, tick, grasping, very, firmly, and, pulling, the, closed, tweezer, straight, away, from, the, skin, without, twisting, jerking, squeezing, or, crushing, the, tick, after, tick, removal, any, tick, parts, remaining, in, the, skin, should, be, removed, with, a, clean, tweezer, if, possible, the, wound, and, hands, should, then, be, cleaned, with, alcohol, or, soap, and, water, the, tick, may, be, disposed, by, placing, it, in, a, container, with, alcohol, sealed, bag, tape, or, flushed, down, the, toilet, the, bitten, person, should, write, down, where, and, when, the, bite, happened, so, that, this, can, be, informed, to, a, doctor, if, the, person, gets, a, rash, or, flu, like, symptoms, in, the, following, several, weeks, cdc, recommends, not, using, fingers, nail, polish, petroleum, jelly, or, heat, on, the, tick, to, try, to, remove, it, in, australia, where, the, australian, paralysis, tick, is, prevalent, the, australasian, society, of, clinical, immunology, and, allergy, recommends, not, using, tweezers, to, remove, ticks, because, if, the, person, is, allergic, anaphylaxis, could, result, instead, a, product, should, be, sprayed, on, the, tick, to, cause, it, to, freeze, and, then, drop, off, another, method, consists, in, using, about, 20, cm, of, dental, floss, or, fishing, line, for, slowly, tying, an, overhand, knot, between, the, skin, and, the, tick, and, then, pulling, it, away, from, the, skin, the, risk, of, infectious, transmission, increases, with, the, duration, of, tick, attachment, it, requires, between, 36, and, 48, hours, of, attachment, for, the, bacteria, that, causes, lyme, to, travel, from, within, the, tick, into, its, saliva, if, a, deer, tick, that, is, sufficiently, likely, to, be, carrying, borrelia, is, found, attached, to, a, person, and, removed, and, if, the, tick, has, been, attached, for, 36, hours, or, is, engorged, a, single, dose, of, doxycycline, administered, within, the, 72, hours, after, removal, may, reduce, the, risk, of, lyme, disease, it, is, not, generally, recommended, for, all, people, bitten, as, development, of, infection, is, rare, about, 50, bitten, people, would, have, to, be, treated, this, way, to, prevent, one, case, of, erythema, migrans, i, e, the, typical, rash, found, in, about, 70, 80, of, people, infected, several, landscaping, practices, may, reduce, the, risk, of, tick, bites, in, residential, yards, these, include, keeping, lawns, mown, removing, leaf, litter, and, weeds, and, avoiding, the, use, of, ground, cover, a, 3, ft, wide, rock, or, woodchip, barrier, is, recommended, to, separate, lawns, from, wood, piles, woodlands, stone, walls, and, shrubs, without, vegetation, on, the, barrier, ticks, will, tend, not, to, cross, it, acaricides, may, also, be, sprayed, on, it, to, kill, ticks, a, sun, exposed, tick, safe, zone, at, least, 9, ft, from, the, barrier, should, concentrate, human, activity, on, the, yard, including, any, patios, playgrounds, and, gardening, materials, such, as, wood, decking, concrete, bricks, gravel, or, woodchips, used, on, the, ground, under, patios, and, playgrounds, would, discourage, ticks, there, an, 8, ft, high, fence, may, be, added, to, keep, deer, away, from, the, tick, safe, zone, outdoor, workers, are, at, risk, of, lyme, disease, if, they, work, at, sites, with, infected, ticks, this, includes, construction, landscaping, forestry, brush, clearing, land, surveying, farming, railroad, work, oil, field, work, utility, line, work, park, or, wildlife, management, u, s, workers, in, the, northeastern, and, north, central, states, are, at, highest, risk, of, exposure, to, infected, ticks, ticks, may, also, transmit, other, tick, borne, diseases, to, workers, in, these, and, other, regions, of, the, country, worksites, with, woods, bushes, high, grass, or, leaf, litter, are, likely, to, have, more, ticks, outdoor, workers, should, be, most, careful, to, protect, themselves, in, the, late, spring, and, summer, when, young, ticks, are, most, active, ticks, can, feed, upon, the, blood, of, a, wide, array, of, possible, host, species, including, lizards, birds, mice, cats, dogs, deer, cattle, and, humans, the, extent, to, which, a, tick, can, feed, reproduce, and, spread, will, depend, on, the, type, and, availability, of, its, hosts, whether, it, will, spread, disease, is, also, affected, by, its, available, hosts, some, species, such, as, lizards, are, referred, to, as, dilution, hosts, because, they, don, t, tend, to, support, lyme, disease, pathogens, and, so, decrease, the, likelihood, that, the, disease, will, be, passed, on, by, ticks, feeding, on, them, white, tailed, deer, are, both, a, food, source, and, a, reproductive, host, where, ticks, tend, to, mate, the, white, footed, mouse, is, a, reservoir, host, in, which, the, pathogen, for, lyme, disease, can, survive, availability, of, hosts, can, have, significant, impacts, on, the, transmission, of, lyme, disease, a, greater, diversity, of, hosts, or, of, those, that, don, t, support, the, pathogen, tends, to, decrease, the, likelihood, that, the, disease, will, be, transmitted, in, the, united, states, one, approach, to, reducing, the, incidence, of, lyme, and, other, deer, tick, borne, diseases, has, been, to, greatly, reduce, the, deer, population, on, which, the, adult, ticks, depend, for, feeding, and, reproduction, lyme, disease, cases, fell, following, deer, eradication, on, an, island, monhegan, maine, and, following, deer, control, in, mumford, cove, connecticut, advocates, have, suggested, reducing, the, deer, population, to, levels, of, 8, to, 10, deer, per, square, mile, compared, to, levels, of, 60, or, more, deer, per, square, mile, in, the, areas, of, the, country, with, the, highest, lyme, disease, rates, others, have, noted, that, while, deer, are, reproductive, hosts, they, are, not, borrelia, burgdorferi, reservoirs, researchers, have, suggested, that, smaller, less, obviously, visible, lyme, reservoirs, like, white, footed, mice, and, eastern, chipmunks, may, more, strongly, impact, lyme, disease, occurrence, ecosystem, studies, in, new, york, state, suggest, that, white, footed, mice, thrive, when, forests, are, broken, into, smaller, isolated, chunks, of, woodland, with, fewer, rodent, predators, with, more, rodents, harboring, the, disease, the, odds, increase, that, a, tick, will, feed, on, a, disease, harboring, rodent, and, that, someone, will, pick, up, a, disease, carrying, tick, in, their, garden, or, walking, in, the, woods, data, indicates, that, the, smaller, the, wooded, area, the, more, ticks, it, will, contain, and, the, likely, they, are, to, carry, lyme, disease, supporting, the, idea, that, deforestation, and, habitat, fragmentation, affect, ticks, hosts, and, disease, transmission, tick, borne, diseases, are, estimated, to, affect, 80, of, cattle, worldwide, they, also, affect, cats, dogs, and, other, pets, routine, veterinary, control, of, ticks, of, domestic, animals, through, the, use, of, acaricides, has, been, suggested, as, a, way, to, reduce, exposure, of, humans, to, ticks, however, chemical, control, with, acaricides, is, now, criticized, on, a, number, of, grounds, ticks, appear, to, develop, resistance, to, acaricides, acaricides, are, costly, and, there, are, concerns, over, their, toxicity, and, the, potential, for, chemical, residues, to, affect, food, and, the, environment, in, europe, known, reservoirs, of, borrelia, burgdorferi, were, 9, small, mammals, 7, medium, sized, mammals, and, 16, species, of, birds, including, passerines, sea, birds, and, pheasants, these, animals, seem, to, transmit, spirochetes, to, ticks, and, thus, participate, in, the, natural, circulation, of, b, burgdorferi, in, europe, the, house, mouse, is, also, suspected, as, well, as, other, species, of, small, rodents, particularly, in, eastern, europe, and, russia, the, reservoir, species, that, contain, the, most, pathogens, are, the, european, roe, deer, capreolus, capreolus, it, does, not, appear, to, serve, as, a, major, reservoir, of, b, burgdorferi, thought, jaenson, al, 1992, incompetent, host, for, b, burgdorferi, and, tbe, virus, but, it, is, important, for, feeding, the, ticks, as, red, deer, and, wild, boars, sus, scrofa, in, which, one, rickettsia, and, three, borrelia, species, were, identified, with, high, risks, of, coinfection, in, roe, deer, nevertheless, in, the, 2000s, in, roe, deer, in, europe, two, species, of, rickettsia, and, two, species, of, borrelia, were, identified, as, of, 2023, no, human, vaccines, for, lyme, disease, were, available, the, only, human, vaccine, to, advance, to, market, was, lymerix, which, was, available, from, 1998, but, discontinued, in, 2002, the, vaccine, candidate, vla15, was, scheduled, to, start, a, phase, 3, trial, in, the, third, quarter, of, 2022, with, other, research, ongoing, multiple, vaccines, are, available, for, the, prevention, of, lyme, disease, in, dogs, the, vaccine, lymerix, was, available, from, 1998, to, 2002, the, recombinant, vaccine, against, lyme, disease, based, on, the, outer, surface, protein, a, ospa, of, b, burgdorferi, with, aluminum, hydroxide, as, adjuvant, was, developed, by, smithkline, beecham, in, clinical, trials, involving, more, than, 10, 000, people, the, vaccine, was, found, to, confer, protective, immunity, to, lyme, disease, in, 76, of, adults, after, three, doses, with, only, mild, or, moderate, and, transient, adverse, effects, on, 21, december, 1998, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, approved, lymerix, on, the, basis, of, these, trials, for, persons, of, ages, 15, through, 70, following, approval, of, the, vaccine, its, entry, into, clinical, practice, was, slow, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, its, cost, which, was, often, not, reimbursed, by, insurance, companies, subsequently, hundreds, of, vaccine, recipients, reported, they, had, developed, autoimmune, and, other, side, effects, supported, by, some, advocacy, groups, a, number, of, class, action, lawsuits, were, filed, against, glaxosmithkline, alleging, the, vaccine, had, caused, these, health, problems, these, claims, were, investigated, by, the, fda, and, the, centers, for, disease, control, which, found, no, connection, between, the, vaccine, and, the, autoimmune, complaints, despite, the, lack, of, evidence, that, the, complaints, were, caused, by, the, vaccine, sales, plummeted, and, lymerix, was, withdrawn, from, the, u, s, market, by, glaxosmithkline, in, february, 2002, in, the, setting, of, negative, media, coverage, and, fears, of, vaccine, side, effects, the, fate, of, lymerix, was, described, in, the, medical, literature, as, a, cautionary, tale, an, editorial, in, nature, cited, the, withdrawal, of, lymerix, as, an, instance, in, which, unfounded, public, fears, place, pressures, on, vaccine, developers, that, go, beyond, reasonable, safety, considerations, the, original, developer, of, the, ospa, vaccine, at, the, max, planck, institute, told, nature, this, just, shows, how, irrational, the, world, can, be, there, was, no, scientific, justification, for, the, first, ospa, vaccine, lymerix, being, pulled, the, hexavalent, ospa, protein, subunit, based, vaccine, candidate, vla15, was, developed, by, valneva, it, was, granted, fast, track, designation, by, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, in, july, 2017, in, april, 2020, pfizer, paid, 130, million, for, the, rights, to, the, vaccine, and, the, companies, are, developing, it, together, performing, multiple, phase, 2, trials, a, phase, 3, trial, of, vla15, was, scheduled, for, late, 2022, recruiting, volunteers, at, test, sites, located, across, the, northeastern, united, states, and, in, europe, participants, were, scheduled, to, receive, an, initial, three, dose, series, of, vaccines, over, the, course, of, five, to, nine, months, followed, by, a, booster, dose, after, twelve, months, with, both, the, initial, series, and, the, booster, dose, scheduled, to, be, complete, before, the, year, s, peak, lyme, disease, season, an, mrna, vaccine, designed, to, cause, a, strong, fast, immune, response, to, tick, saliva, allowed, the, immune, system, to, detect, and, remove, the, ticks, from, test, animals, before, they, were, able, to, transmit, the, infectious, bacteria, the, vaccine, contains, mrnas, for, the, body, to, build, 19, proteins, in, tick, saliva, which, by, enabling, quick, development, of, erythema, itchy, redness, at, the, bite, site, protects, guinea, pigs, against, lyme, disease, it, also, protected, the, test, animals, if, the, tick, is, not, removed, if, only, one, tick, but, not, three, remain, attached, canine, vaccines, have, been, formulated, and, approved, for, the, prevention, of, lyme, disease, in, dogs, currently, three, lyme, disease, vaccines, are, available, lymevax, formulated, by, fort, dodge, laboratories, contains, intact, dead, spirochetes, which, expose, the, host, to, the, organism, galaxy, lyme, intervet, schering, plough, s, vaccine, targets, proteins, ospc, and, ospa, the, ospc, antibodies, kill, any, of, the, bacteria, that, have, not, been, killed, by, the, ospa, antibodies, canine, recombinant, lyme, formulated, by, merial, generates, antibodies, against, the, ospa,

the, dog, antibiotics, are, the, primary, treatment, the, specific, approach, to, their, use, is, dependent, on, the, individual, affected, and, the, stage, of, the, disease, for, most, people, with, early, localized, infection, oral, administration, of, doxycycline, is, widely, recommended, as, the, first, choice, as, it, is, effective, against, not, only, borrelia, bacteria, but, also, a, variety, of, other, illnesses, carried, by, ticks, people, taking, doxycycline, should, avoid, sun, exposure, because, of, higher, risk, of, sunburns, doxycycline, is, contraindicated, in, children, younger, than, eight, years, of, age, and, women, who, are, pregnant, or, breastfeeding, alternatives, to, doxycycline, are, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, axetil, and, azithromycin, azithromycin, is, recommended, only, in, case, of, intolerance, to, the, other, antibiotics, the, standard, treatment, for, cellulitis, cephalexin, is, not, useful, for, lyme, disease, when, it, is, unclear, if, a, rash, is, caused, by, lyme, or, cellulitis, the, idsa, recommends, treatment, with, cefuroxime, or, amoxicillin, clavulanic, acid, as, these, are, effective, against, both, infections, individuals, with, early, disseminated, or, late, lyme, infection, may, have, symptomatic, cardiac, disease, lyme, arthritis, or, neurologic, symptoms, like, facial, palsy, radiculopathy, meningitis, or, peripheral, neuropathy, intravenous, administration, of, ceftriaxone, is, recommended, as, the, first, choice, in, these, cases, cefotaxime, and, doxycycline, are, available, as, alternatives, treatment, regimens, for, lyme, disease, range, from, 7, 14, days, in, early, localized, disease, to, 14, 21, days, in, early, disseminated, disease, to, 14, 28, days, in, late, disseminated, disease, neurologic, complications, of, lyme, disease, may, be, treated, with, doxycycline, as, it, can, be, taken, by, mouth, and, has, a, lower, cost, although, in, north, america, evidence, of, efficacy, is, only, indirect, in, case, of, failure, guidelines, recommend, retreatment, with, injectable, ceftriaxone, several, months, after, treatment, for, lyme, arthritis, if, joint, swelling, persists, or, returns, a, second, round, of, antibiotics, may, be, considered, intravenous, antibiotics, are, preferred, for, retreatment, in, case, of, poor, response, to, oral, antibiotics, outside, of, that, a, prolonged, antibiotic, regimen, lasting, more, than, 28, days, is, not, recommended, as, no, evidence, shows, it, to, be, effective, igm, and, igg, antibody, levels, may, be, elevated, for, years, even, after, successful, treatment, with, antibiotics, as, antibody, levels, are, not, indicative, of, treatment, success, testing, for, them, is, not, recommended, facial, palsy, may, resolve, without, treatment, however, antibiotic, treatment, is, recommended, to, stop, other, lyme, complications, corticosteroids, are, not, recommended, when, facial, palsy, is, caused, by, lyme, disease, in, those, with, facial, palsy, frequent, use, of, artificial, tears, while, awake, is, recommended, along, with, ointment, and, a, patch, or, taping, the, eye, closed, when, sleeping, about, a, third, of, people, with, lyme, carditis, need, a, temporary, pacemaker, until, their, heart, conduction, abnormality, resolves, and, 21, need, to, be, hospitalized, lyme, carditis, should, not, be, treated, with, corticosteroids, people, with, lyme, arthritis, should, limit, their, level, of, physical, activity, to, avoid, damaging, affected, joints, and, in, case, of, limping, should, use, crutches, pain, associated, with, lyme, disease, may, be, treated, with, nonsteroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, nsaids, corticosteroid, joint, injections, are, not, recommended, for, lyme, arthritis, that, is, being, treated, with, antibiotics, people, with, lyme, arthritis, treated, with, intravenous, antibiotics, or, two, months, of, oral, antibiotics, who, continue, to, have, joint, swelling, two, months, after, treatment, and, have, negative, pcr, test, for, borrelia, dna, in, the, synovial, fluid, are, said, to, have, post, antibiotic, lyme, arthritis, this, is, more, common, after, infection, by, certain, borrelia, strains, in, people, with, certain, genetic, and, immunologic, characteristics, post, antibiotic, lyme, arthritis, may, be, symptomatically, treated, with, nsaids, disease, modifying, antirheumatic, drugs, dmards, arthroscopic, synovectomy, or, physical, therapy, people, receiving, treatment, should, be, advised, that, reinfection, is, possible, and, how, to, prevent, it, lyme, disease, s, typical, first, sign, the, erythema, migrans, em, rash, resolves, within, several, weeks, even, without, treatment, however, in, untreated, people, the, infection, often, disseminates, to, the, nervous, system, heart, or, joints, possibly, causing, permanent, damage, to, body, tissues, people, who, receive, recommended, antibiotic, treatment, within, several, days, of, appearance, of, an, initial, em, rash, have, the, best, prospects, recovery, may, not, be, total, or, immediate, the, percentage, of, people, achieving, full, recovery, in, the, united, states, increases, from, about, 64, 71, at, end, of, treatment, for, em, rash, to, about, 84, 90, after, 30, months, higher, percentages, are, reported, in, europe, treatment, failure, i, e, persistence, of, original, or, appearance, of, new, signs, of, the, disease, occurs, only, in, a, few, people, remaining, people, are, considered, cured, but, continue, to, experience, subjective, symptoms, e, g, joint, or, muscle, pains, or, fatigue, these, symptoms, are, usually, mild, and, nondisabling, people, treated, only, after, nervous, system, manifestations, of, the, disease, may, end, up, with, objective, neurological, deficits, in, addition, to, subjective, symptoms, in, europe, an, average, of, 32, 33, months, after, initial, lyme, symptoms, in, people, treated, mostly, with, doxycycline, 200, mg, for, 14, 21, days, the, percentage, of, people, with, lingering, symptoms, was, much, higher, among, those, diagnosed, with, neuroborreliosis, 50, than, among, those, with, only, an, em, rash, 16, in, another, european, study, 5, years, after, treatment, for, neuroborreliosis, lingering, symptoms, were, less, common, among, children, 15, than, adults, 30, and, in, the, latter, were, less, common, among, those, treated, within, 30, days, of, the, first, symptom, 16, than, among, those, treated, later, 39, among, those, with, lingering, symptoms, 54, had, daily, activities, restricted, and, 19, were, on, sick, leave, or, incapacitated, some, data, suggest, that, about, 90, of, lyme, facial, palsies, treated, with, antibiotics, recover, fully, a, median, of, 24, days, after, appearing, and, most, of, the, rest, recover, with, only, mild, abnormality, however, in, europe, 41, of, people, treated, for, facial, palsy, had, other, lingering, symptoms, at, followup, up, to, 6, months, later, including, 28, with, numbness, or, altered, sensation, and, 14, with, fatigue, or, concentration, problems, palsies, in, both, sides, of, the, face, are, associated, with, worse, and, longer, time, to, recovery, historical, data, suggests, that, untreated, people, with, facial, palsies, recover, at, nearly, the, same, rate, but, 88, subsequently, have, lyme, arthritis, other, research, shows, that, synkinesis, involuntary, movement, of, a, facial, muscle, when, another, one, is, voluntarily, moved, can, become, evident, only, 6, 12, months, after, facial, palsy, appears, to, be, resolved, as, damaged, nerves, regrow, and, sometimes, connect, to, incorrect, muscles, synkinesis, is, associated, with, corticosteroid, use, in, longer, term, follow, up, 16, 23, of, lyme, facial, palsies, do, not, fully, recover, in, europe, about, a, quarter, of, people, with, bannwarth, syndrome, lyme, radiculopathy, and, lymphocytic, meningitis, treated, with, intravenous, ceftriaxone, for, 14, days, an, average, of, 30, days, after, first, symptoms, had, to, be, retreated, 3, 6, months, later, because, of, unsatisfactory, clinical, response, or, continued, objective, markers, of, infection, in, cerebrospinal, fluid, after, 12, months, 64, recovered, fully, 31, had, nondisabling, mild, or, infrequent, symptoms, that, did, not, require, regular, use, of, analgesics, and, 5, had, symptoms, that, were, disabling, or, required, substantial, use, of, analgesics, the, most, common, lingering, nondisabling, symptoms, were, headache, fatigue, altered, sensation, joint, pains, memory, disturbances, malaise, radicular, pain, sleep, disturbances, muscle, pains, and, concentration, disturbances, lingering, disabling, symptoms, included, facial, palsy, and, other, impaired, movement, recovery, from, late, neuroborreliosis, tends, to, take, longer, and, be, less, complete, than, from, early, neuroborreliosis, probably, because, of, irreversible, neurologic, damage, about, half, the, people, with, lyme, carditis, progress, to, complete, heart, block, but, it, usually, resolves, in, a, week, other, lyme, heart, conduction, abnormalities, resolve, typically, within, 6, weeks, about, 94, of, people, have, full, recovery, but, 5, need, a, permanent, pacemaker, and, 1, end, up, with, persistent, heart, block, the, actual, percentage, may, be, higher, because, of, unrecognized, cases, lyme, myocardial, complications, usually, are, mild, and, self, limiting, however, in, some, cases, lyme, carditis, can, be, fatal, recommended, antibiotic, treatments, are, effective, in, about, 90, of, lyme, arthritis, cases, although, it, can, take, several, months, for, inflammation, to, resolve, and, a, second, round, of, antibiotics, is, often, necessary, antibiotic, refractory, lyme, arthritis, also, eventually, resolves, typically, within, 9, 14, months, range, 4, months, 4, years, dmards, or, synovectomy, can, accelerate, recovery, reinfection, is, not, uncommon, in, a, u, s, study, 6, 11, of, people, treated, for, an, em, rash, had, another, em, rash, within, 30, months, the, second, rash, typically, is, due, to, infection, by, a, different, borrelia, strain, chronic, symptoms, like, pain, fatigue, or, cognitive, impairment, are, experienced, by, 5, 20, of, people, who, contract, lyme, disease, even, after, completing, treatment, this, is, called, post, treatment, lyme, disease, syndrome, or, ptlds, the, cause, is, unknown, one, hypothesis, is, that, a, persistent, difficult, to, detect, infection, remains, work, with, mice, dogs, and, non, human, primates, have, shown, evidence, of, persistent, b, burgdorferi, although, these, remaining, bacteria, are, hard, to, cultivate, and, koch, s, postulates, are, hard, to, prove, another, hypothesis, is, that, autoimmunity, has, been, triggered, by, the, infection, auto, immune, responses, are, known, to, occur, following, other, infections, including, campylobacter, guillain, barr, syndrome, chlamydia, reactive, arthritis, and, strep, throat, rheumatic, heart, disease, a, third, hypothesis, is, that, symptoms, are, simply, unrelated, to, the, previous, lyme, infection, there, is, no, proven, treatment, for, post, treatment, lyme, disease, syndrome, while, short, term, antibiotics, are, effective, in, early, lyme, disease, prolonged, antibiotics, are, not, they, have, been, shown, ineffective, in, placebo, controlled, trials, and, carry, the, risk, of, serious, sometimes, deadly, complications, generally, treatment, is, symptomatic, and, is, similar, to, the, management, of, fibromyalgia, or, me, cfs, ptlds, usually, gets, better, over, time, but, recovery, may, take, many, months, lyme, disease, occurs, regularly, in, northern, hemisphere, temperate, regions, an, estimated, 476, 000, people, a, year, are, diagnosed, and, treated, for, the, disease, in, the, united, states, this, number, is, likely, an, overestimate, due, to, overdiagnosis, and, overtreatment, over, 200, 000, people, a, year, are, diagnosed, and, treated, in, europe, there, is, a, suggestion, that, tick, populations, and, lyme, disease, occurrence, are, increasing, and, spreading, into, new, areas, due, in, part, to, the, warming, temperatures, of, climate, change, however, tick, borne, disease, systems, are, complex, and, determining, whether, changes, are, due, to, climate, change, or, other, drivers, can, be, difficult, lyme, disease, effects, are, comparable, among, males, and, females, a, wide, range, of, age, groups, is, affected, though, the, number, of, cases, is, highest, among, 10, to, 19, year, olds, in, northern, africa, b, burgdorferi, sensu, lato, has, been, identified, in, morocco, algeria, egypt, and, tunisia, lyme, disease, in, sub, saharan, africa, is, presently, unknown, but, evidence, indicates, it, may, occur, in, humans, in, this, region, the, abundance, of, hosts, and, tick, vectors, would, favor, the, establishment, of, lyme, infection, in, africa, in, east, africa, two, cases, of, lyme, disease, have, been, reported, in, kenya, according, the, federation, of, infectious, diseases, societies, of, southern, africa, lyme, disease, is, not, known, to, be, endemic, in, either, south, africa, or, mozambique, b, burgdorferi, sensu, lato, infested, ticks, are, being, found, more, frequently, in, japan, as, well, as, in, northwest, china, nepal, thailand, and, far, eastern, russia, borrelia, has, also, been, isolated, in, mongolia, lyme, disease, is, not, considered, endemic, to, australia, while, there, have, been, reports, of, people, acquiring, lyme, disease, in, australia, and, even, evidence, of, closely, related, borrelia, species, in, ticks, the, evidence, linking, these, cases, to, local, transmission, is, limited, ongoing, research, on, resolving, potential, borrelia, species, to, debilitating, symptom, complexes, attributed, to, ticks, dscatt, in, australia, are, ongoing, in, europe, lyme, disease, is, caused, by, infection, with, one, or, more, pathogenic, european, genospecies, of, the, spirochaete, b, burgdorferi, sensu, lato, mainly, transmitted, by, the, tick, ixodes, ricinus, cases, of, b, burgdorferi, sensu, lato, infected, ticks, are, found, predominantly, in, central, europe, particularly, in, slovenia, and, austria, but, have, been, isolated, in, almost, every, country, on, the, continent, the, number, of, cases, in, southern, europe, such, as, italy, and, portugal, is, much, lower, diagnosed, cases, in, some, western, countries, such, as, iceland, are, rising, lyme, disease, is, rare, in, iceland, on, average, around, 6, to, 7, cases, are, diagnosed, every, year, primarily, localised, infections, presenting, as, erythema, migrans, none, of, the, cases, had, a, definitive, icelandic, origin, and, the, yearly, number, of, cases, has, not, been, increasing, in, the, united, kingdom, the, number, of, laboratory, confirmed, cases, of, lyme, disease, has, been, rising, steadily, since, voluntary, reporting, was, introduced, in, 1986, when, 68, cases, were, recorded, in, the, uk, and, ireland, combined, in, the, uk, there, were, 23, confirmed, cases, in, 1988, and, 19, in, 1990, but, 973, in, 2009, and, 953, in, 2010, provisional, figures, for, the, first, 3, quarters, of, 2011, show, a, 26, increase, on, the, same, period, in, 2010, it, is, thought, however, that, the, actual, number, of, cases, is, significantly, higher, than, suggested, by, the, above, figures, with, england, s, health, protection, agency, estimating, that, there, are, between, 2, 000, and, 3, 000, cases, in, england, and, wales, per, year, with, an, average, of, around, 15, of, the, infections, acquired, overseas, while, dr, darrel, ho, yen, director, of, the, scottish, toxoplasma, reference, laboratory, and, national, lyme, disease, testing, service, believes, that, the, number, of, confirmed, cases, should, be, multiplied, by, 10, to, take, account, of, wrongly, diagnosed, cases, tests, giving, false, results, sufferers, who, weren, t, tested, people, who, are, infected, but, not, showing, symptoms, failures, to, notify, and, infected, individuals, who, don, t, consult, a, doctor, despite, lyme, disease, borrelia, burgdorferi, infection, being, a, notifiable, disease, in, scotland, since, january, 1990, which, should, therefore, be, reported, on, the, basis, of, clinical, suspicion, it, is, believed, that, many, gps, are, unaware, of, the, requirement, mandatory, reporting, limited, to, laboratory, test, results, only, was, introduced, throughout, the, uk, in, october, 2010, under, the, health, protection, notification, regulations, 2010, although, there, is, a, greater, number, of, cases, of, lyme, disease, in, the, new, forest, salisbury, plain, exmoor, the, south, downs, parts, of, wiltshire, and, berkshire, thetford, forest, and, the, west, coast, and, islands, of, scotland, infected, ticks, are, widespread, and, can, even, be, found, in, the, parks, of, london, a, 1989, report, found, that, 25, of, forestry, workers, in, the, new, forest, were, seropositive, as, were, between, 2, and, 4, 5, of, the, general, local, population, of, the, area, tests, on, pet, dogs, carried, out, throughout, the, country, in, 2009, indicated, that, around, 2, 5, of, ticks, in, the, uk, may, be, infected, considerably, higher, than, previously, thought, it, is, speculated, that, global, warming, may, lead, to, an, increase, in, tick, activity, in, the, future, as, well, as, an, increase, in, the, amount, of, time, that, people, spend, in, public, parks, thus, increasing, the, risk, of, infection, however, no, published, research, has, proven, this, to, be, so, many, studies, in, north, america, have, examined, ecological, and, environmental, correlates, of, the, number, of, people, affected, by, lyme, disease, a, 2005, study, using, climate, suitability, modelling, of, i, scapularis, projected, that, climate, change, would, cause, an, overall, 213, increase, in, suitable, vector, habitat, by, 2080, with, northward, expansions, in, canada, increased, suitability, in, the, central, u, s, and, decreased, suitable, habitat, and, vector, retraction, in, the, southern, u, s, a, 2008, review, of, published, studies, concluded, that, the, presence, of, forests, or, forested, areas, was, the, only, variable, that, consistently, elevated, the, risk, of, lyme, disease, whereas, other, environmental, variables, showed, little, or, no, concordance, between, studies, the, authors, argued, that, the, factors, influencing, tick, density, and, human, risk, between, sites, are, still, poorly, understood, and, that, future, studies, should, be, conducted, over, longer, time, periods, become, more, standardized, across, regions, and, incorporate, existing, knowledge, of, regional, lyme, disease, ecology, the, range, of, ticks, able, to, carry, lyme, disease, has, expanded, from, a, limited, area, of, ontario, to, include, areas, of, southern, quebec, manitoba, northern, ontario, southern, new, brunswick, southwest, nova, scotia, and, limited, parts, of, saskatchewan, and, alberta, as, well, as, british, columbia, cases, have, been, reported, as, far, east, as, the, island, of, newfoundland, a, model, based, prediction, by, leighton, et, al, 2012, suggests, that, the, range, of, the, i, scapularis, tick, will, expand, into, canada, by, 46, km, year, over, the, next, decade, with, warming, climatic, temperatures, as, the, main, driver, of, increased, speed, of, spread, a, 2007, study, suggests, borrelia, burgdorferi, infections, are, endemic, to, mexico, from, four, cases, reported, between, 1999, and, 2000, lyme, disease, is, the, most, common, tick, borne, disease, in, north, america, and, europe, and, one, of, the, fastest, growing, infectious, diseases, in, the, united, states, of, cases, reported, to, the, united, states, cdc, the, ratio, of, lyme, disease, infection, is, 7, 9, cases, for, every, 100, 000, persons, in, the, ten, states, where, lyme, disease, is, most, common, the, average, was, 31, 6, cases, for, every, 100, 000, persons, for, the, year, 2005, although, lyme, disease, has, been, reported, in, all, states, due, to, travel, associated, infections, about, 99, of, all, reported, cases, are, confined, to, just, five, geographic, areas, new, england, mid, atlantic, east, north, central, south, atlantic, and, west, north, central, cdc, implemented, national, surveillance, of, lyme, disease, cases, in, 1991, since, then, reporting, criteria, has, been, modified, multiple, times, the, 2022, surveillance, case, definition, classifies, cases, as, confirmed, probable, and, suspect, the, number, of, reported, cases, of, the, disease, has, been, increasing, as, are, endemic, regions, in, north, america, the, cdc, emphasizes, that, while, surveillance, data, has, limitations, it, is, useful, due, to, uniformity, simplicity, and, timeliness, while, cases, are, under, reported, in, high, incidence, areas, over, reporting, is, likely, in, low, incidence, areas, additionally, surveillance, cases, are, reported, by, county, of, residence, and, not, where, an, infection, was, necessarily, contracted, several, similar, but, apparently, distinct, conditions, may, exist, caused, by, various, species, or, subspecies, of, borrelia, in, north, america, a, regionally, restricted, condition, that, may, be, related, to, borrelia, infection, is, southern, tick, associated, rash, illness, stari, also, known, as, masters, disease, amblyomma, americanum, known, commonly, as, the, lone, star, tick, is, recognized, as, the, primary, vector, for, stari, in, some, parts, of, the, geographical, distribution, of, stari, lyme, disease, is, quite, rare, e, g, arkansas, so, people, in, these, regions, experiencing, lyme, like, symptoms, especially, if, they, follow, a, bite, from, a, lone, star, tick, should, consider, stari, as, a, possibility, it, is, generally, a, milder, condition, than, lyme, and, typically, responds, well, to, antibiotic, treatment, in, recent, years, there, have, been, 5, to, 10, cases, a, year, of, a, disease, similar, to, lyme, occurring, in, montana, it, occurs, primarily, in, pockets, along, the, yellowstone, river, in, central, montana, people, have, developed, a, red, bull, s, eye, rash, around, a, tick, bite, followed, by, weeks, of, fatigue, and, a, fever, in, brazil, a, lyme, like, disease, known, as, baggio, yoshinari, syndrome, was, identified, caused, by, microorganisms, that, do, not, belong, to, the, b, burgdorferi, sensu, lato, complex, and, transmitted, by, ticks, of, the, amblyomma, and, rhipicephalus, genera, the, first, reported, case, of, bys, in, brazil, was, made, in, 1992, in, cotia, s, o, paulo, lyme, disease, was, diagnosed, as, a, separate, condition, for, the, first, time, in, 1975, in, lyme, connecticut, the, earliest, known, evidence, of, was, found, in, oetzi, a, 5300, year, old, mummy, in, the, eastern, alps, near, the, italian, border, the, evolutionary, history, of, borrelia, burgdorferi, genetics, has, been, examined, by, scientists, one, study, has, found, that, prior, to, the, reforestation, that, accompanied, post, colonial, farm, abandonment, in, new, england, and, the, wholesale, migration, into, the, mid, west, that, occurred, during, the, early, 19th, century, lyme, disease, had, been, present, for, thousands, of, years, in, america, and, had, spread, along, with, its, tick, hosts, from, the, northeast, to, the, midwest, john, josselyn, who, visited, new, england, in, 1638, and, again, from, 1663, to, 1670, wrote, there, be, infinite, numbers, of, ticks, hanging, upon, the, bushes, in, summertime, that, will, cleave, to, man, s, garments, and, creep, into, his, breeches, eating, themselves, in, a, short, time, into, the, very, flesh, of, a, man, i, have, seen, the, stockings, of, those, that, have, gone, through, the, woods, covered, with, them, this, is, also, confirmed, by, the, writings, of, peter, kalm, a, swedish, botanist, who, was, sent, to, america, by, linnaeus, and, who, found, the, forests, of, new, york, abound, with, ticks, when, he, visited, in, 1749, when, kalm, s, journey, was, retraced, 100, years, later, the, forests, were, gone, and, the, lyme, bacterium, had, probably, become, isolated, to, a, few, pockets, along, the, northeast, coast, wisconsin, and, minnesota, perhaps, the, first, detailed, description, of, what, is, now, known, as, lyme, disease, appeared, in, the, writings, of, john, walker, after, a, visit, to, the, island, of, jura, deer, island, off, the, west, coast, of, scotland, in, 1764, he, gives, a, good, description, both, of, the, symptoms, of, lyme, disease, with, exquisite, pain, the, interior, parts, of, the, limbs, and, of, the, tick, vector, itself, which, he, describes, as, a, worm, with, a, body, which, is, of, a, reddish, color, and, of, a, compressed, shape, with, a, row, of, feet, on, each, side, that, penetrates, the, skin, many, people, from, this, area, of, great, britain, emigrated, to, north, america, between, 1717, and, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, examination, of, preserved, museum, specimens, has, found, borrelia, dna, in, an, infected, ixodes, ricinus, tick, from, germany, that, dates, back, to, 1884, and, from, an, infected, mouse, from, cape, cod, that, died, in, 1894, the, 2010, autopsy, of, tzi, the, iceman, a, 5, 300, year, old, mummy, revealed, the, presence, of, the, dna, sequence, of, borrelia, burgdorferi, making, him, the, earliest, known, human, with, lyme, disease, the, early, european, studies, of, what, is, now, known, as, lyme, disease, described, its, skin, manifestations, the, first, study, dates, to, 1883, in, breslau, germany, now, wroc, aw, poland, where, physician, alfred, buchwald, described, a, man, who, for, 16, years, had, had, a, degenerative, skin, disorder, now, known, as, acrodermatitis, chronica, atrophicans, at, a, 1909, research, conference, swedish, dermatologist, arvid, afzelius, presented, a, study, about, an, expanding, ring, like, lesion, he, had, observed, in, an, older, woman, following, the, bite, of, a, sheep, tick, he, named, the, lesion, erythema, migrans, the, skin, condition, now, known, as, borrelial, lymphocytoma, was, first, described, in, 1911, the, modern, history, of, medical, understanding, of, the, disease, including, its, cause, diagnosis, and, treatment, has, been, difficult, neurological, problems, following, tick, bites, were, recognized, starting, in, the, 1920s, french, physicians, garin, and, bujadoux, described, a, farmer, with, a, painful, sensory, radiculitis, accompanied, by, mild, meningitis, following, a, tick, bite, a, large, ring, shaped, rash, was, also, noted, although, the, doctors, did, not, relate, it, to, the, meningoradiculitis, in, 1930, the, swedish, dermatologist, sven, hellerstr, m, was, the, first, to, propose, em, and, neurological, symptoms, following, a, tick, bite, were, related, in, the, 1940s, german, neurologist, alfred, bannwarth, described, several, cases, of, chronic, lymphocytic, meningitis, and, polyradiculoneuritis, some, of, which, were, accompanied, by, erythematous, skin, lesions, carl, lennhoff, who, worked, at, the, karolinska, institute, in, sweden, believed, many, skin, conditions, were, caused, by, spirochetes, in, 1948, he, published, on, his, use, of, a, special, stain, to, microscopically, observe, what, he, believed, were, spirochetes, in, various, types, of, skin, lesions, including, em, although, his, conclusions, were, later, shown, to, be, erroneous, interest, in, the, study, of, spirochetes, was, sparked, starting, in, 1946, facilities, in, sweden, experimented, with, treating, em, rashes, with, substances, known, to, kill, spirochetes, einar, hollstr, m, reported, that, penicillin, was, found, to, be, the, most, effective, in, 1949, nils, thyresson, who, also, worked, at, the, karolinska, institute, was, the, first, to, treat, aca, with, penicillin, in, the, 1950s, the, relationship, among, tick, bite, lymphocytoma, em, and, bannwarth, s, syndrome, was, recognized, throughout, europe, leading, to, the, widespread, use, of, penicillin, for, treatment, in, europe, in, 1970, a, dermatologist, in, wisconsin, named, rudolph, scrimenti, recognized, an, em, lesion, in, a, person, after, recalling, a, paper, by, hellerstr, m, that, had, been, reprinted, in, an, american, science, journal, in, 1950, this, was, the, first, documented, case, of, em, in, the, united, states, based, on, the, european, literature, he, treated, the, person, with, penicillin, the, full, syndrome, now, known, as, lyme, disease, was, not, recognized, until, a, cluster, of, cases, originally, thought, to, be, juvenile, rheumatoid, arthritis, was, identified, in, three, towns, in, southeastern, connecticut, in, 1975, including, the, towns, lyme, and, old, lyme, which, gave, the, disease, its, popular, name, this, was, investigated, by, physicians, david, snydman, and, allen, steere, of, the, epidemic, intelligence, service, and, by, others, from, yale, university, including, stephen, malawista, who, is, credited, as, a, co, discover, of, the, disease, the, recognition, that, the, people, in, the, united, states, had, em, led, to, the, recognition, that, lyme, arthritis, was, one, manifestation, of, the, same, tick, borne, condition, known, in, europe, before, 1976, the, elements, of, b, burgdorferi, sensu, lato, infection, were, called, or, known, as, tick, borne, meningopolyneuritis, garin, bujadoux, syndrome, bannwarth, syndrome, afzelius, s, disease, montauk, knee, or, sheep, tick, fever, since, 1976, the, disease, is, most, often, referred, to, as, lyme, disease, lyme, borreliosis, or, simply, borreliosis, in, 1980, steere, et, al, began, to, test, antibiotic, regimens, in, adults, with, lyme, disease, in, the, same, year, new, york, state, health, dept, epidemiologist, jorge, benach, provided, willy, burgdorfer, a, researcher, at, the, rocky, mountain, biological, laboratory, with, collections, of, i, dammini, from, shelter, island, new, york, a, known, lyme, endemic, area, as, part, of, an, ongoing, investigation, of, rocky, mountain, spotted, fever, in, examining, the, ticks, for, rickettsiae, burgdorfer, noticed, poorly, stained, rather, long, irregularly, coiled, spirochetes, further, examination, revealed, spirochetes, in, 60, of, the, ticks, burgdorfer, credited, his, familiarity, with, the, european, literature, for, his, realization, that, the, spirochetes, might, be, the, long, sought, cause, of, ecm, and, lyme, disease, benach, supplied, him, with, more, ticks, from, shelter, island, and, sera, from, people, diagnosed, with, lyme, disease, university, of, texas, health, science, center, researcher, alan, barbour, offered, his, expertise, to, culture, and, immunochemically, characterize, the, organism, burgdorfer, subsequently, confirmed, his, discovery, by, isolating, from, people, with, lyme, disease, spirochetes, identical, to, those, found, in, ticks, in, june, 1982, he, published, his, findings, in, science, and, the, spirochete, was, named, borrelia, burgdorferi, in, his, honor, after, the, identification, of, b, burgdorferi, as, the, causative, agent, of, lyme, disease, antibiotics, were, selected, for, testing, guided, by, in, vitro, antibiotic, sensitivities, including, tetracycline, antibiotics, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, axetil, intravenous, and, intramuscular, penicillin, and, intravenous, ceftriaxone, the, mechanism, of, tick, transmission, was, also, the, subject, of, much, discussion, b, burgdorferi, spirochetes, were, identified, in, tick, saliva, in, 1987, confirming, the, hypothesis, that, transmission, occurred, via, tick, salivary, glands, urbanization, and, other, anthropogenic, factors, can, be, implicated, in, the, spread, of, lyme, disease, to, humans, in, many, areas, expansion, of, suburban, neighborhoods, has, led, to, gradual, deforestation, of, surrounding, wooded, areas, and, increased, border, contact, between, humans, and, tick, dense, areas, human, expansion, has, also, resulted, in, a, reduction, of, predators, that, hunt, deer, as, well, as, mice, chipmunks, and, other, small, rodents, the, primary, reservoirs, for, lyme, disease, as, a, consequence, of, increased, human, contact, with, host, and, vector, the, likelihood, of, transmission, of, the, disease, has, greatly, increased, researchers, are, investigating, possible, links, between, global, warming, and, the, spread, of, vector, borne, diseases, including, lyme, disease, given, these, habitat, host, dynamics, in, 2003, some, researchers, began, to, postulate, whether, the, so, called, dilution, effect, could, mitigate, the, spread, of, lyme, disease, the, dilution, effect, is, a, hypothesis, that, predicts, that, an, increase, in, host, biodiversity, will, result, in, a, decrease, in, the, number, of, vectors, infected, with, b, burgdorferi, scientific, research, has, shown, that, nymphal, infection, prevalence, nip, decreases, as, the, number, of, host, species, increases, supporting, the, dilution, effect, that, said, there, is, no, direct, relationship, between, decreased, nip, and, decreased, epidemiological, risk, as, this, has, yet, to, be, proven, additionally, as, of, 2018, the, dilution, effect, is, only, supported, in, the, northeastern, united, states, and, has, been, disproved, in, other, parts, of, the, world, that, also, experience, high, lyme, disease, incidence, rates, the, term, chronic, lyme, disease, is, controversial, and, not, recognized, in, the, medical, literature, and, most, medical, authorities, advise, against, long, term, antibiotic, treatment, for, lyme, disease, studies, have, shown, that, most, people, diagnosed, with, chronic, lyme, disease, either, have, no, objective, evidence, of, previous, or, current, infection, with, b, burgdorferi, or, are, people, who, should, be, classified, as, having, post, treatment, lyme, disease, syndrome, ptlds, which, is, defined, as, continuing, or, relapsing, non, specific, symptoms, such, as, fatigue, musculoskeletal, pain, and, cognitive, complaints, in, a, person, previously, treated, for, lyme, disease, the, 2008, documentary, under, our, skin, is, known, for, promoting, controversial, and, unrecognized, theories, about, chronic, lyme, disease, prevention, of, lyme, disease, is, an, important, step, in, keeping, dogs, safe, in, endemic, areas, prevention, education, and, a, number, of, preventive, measures, are, available, first, for, dog, owners, who, live, near, or, who, often, frequent, tick, infested, areas, routine, vaccinations, of, their, dogs, is, an, important, step, another, crucial, preventive, measure, is, the, use, of, persistent, acaricides, such, as, topical, repellents, or, pesticides, that, contain, triazapentadienes, amitraz, phenylpyrazoles, fipronil, or, permethrin, pyrethroids, these, acaricides, target, primarily, the, adult, stages, of, lyme, carrying, ticks, and, reduce, the, number, of, reproductively, active, ticks, in, the, environment, formulations, of, these, ingredients, are, available, in, a, variety, of, topical, forms, including, spot, ons, sprays, powders, impregnated, collars, solutions, and, shampoos, examination, of, a, dog, for, ticks, after, being, in, a, tick, infested, area, is, an, important, precautionary, measure, to, take, in, the, prevention, of, lyme, disease, key, spots, to, examine, include, the, head, neck, and, ears, in, dogs, a, serious, long, term, prognosis, may, result, in, glomerular, disease, which, is, a, category, of, kidney, damage, that, may, cause, chronic, kidney, disease, dogs, may, also, experience, chronic, joint, disease, if, the, disease, is, left, untreated, however, the, majority, of, cases, of, lyme, disease, in, dogs, result, in, complete, recovery, with, and, sometimes, without, treatment, with, antibiotics, in, rare, cases, lyme, disease, can, be, fatal, to, both, humans, and, dogs, unlike, dogs, it, is, very, rare, for, a, cat, to, be, infected, with, lyme, disease, however, cats, are, nevertheless, capable, of, being, infected, with, b, burgdorferi, following, a, bite, from, an, infected, tick, cats, who, are, infected, with, lyme, disease, may, show, symptoms, including, but, not, limited, to, lameness, fatigue, or, loss, of, appetite, in, two, cases, the, infected, cats, experienced, cardiac, irregularities, similar, to, symptoms, of, lyme, in, both, dogs, and, humans, however, cats, who, are, infected, with, lyme, disease, are, likely, to, be, asymptomatic, and, show, no, noticeable, signs, of, the, disease, cats, with, lyme, are, often, treated, with, antibiotics, much, like, other, animals, in, some, cases, additional, treatment, or, therapy, may, be, required, while, lyme, disease, can, occur, in, horses, not, every, infection, with, b, burgdorferi, is, associated, with, symptoms, especially, detection, of, specific, antibodies, against, b, burgdorferi, alone, is, not, sufficient, for, a, diagnosis, of, equine, lyme, disease, and, unspecific, testing, for, antibodies, is, not, recommended, this, article, incorporates, public, domain, material, from, post, treatment,
