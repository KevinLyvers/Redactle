scolopacidae, is, a, large, family, of, shorebirds, or, waders, which, mainly, includes, many, species, known, as, sandpipers, but, also, others, such, as, woodcocks, curlews, and, snipes, the, majority, of, these, species, eat, small, invertebrates, picked, out, of, the, mud, or, soil, different, lengths, of, bills, enable, different, species, to, feed, in, the, same, habitat, particularly, on, the, coast, without, direct, competition, for, food, sandpipers, have, long, bodies, and, legs, and, narrow, wings, most, species, have, a, narrow, bill, but, otherwise, the, form, and, length, are, quite, variable, they, are, small, to, medium, sized, birds, measuring, 12, to, 66, cm, 4, 7, 26, 0, in, in, length, the, bills, are, sensitive, allowing, the, birds, to, feel, the, mud, and, sand, as, they, probe, for, food, they, generally, have, dull, plumage, with, cryptic, brown, grey, or, streaked, patterns, although, some, display, brighter, colours, during, the, breeding, season, most, species, nest, in, open, areas, and, defend, their, territories, with, aerial, displays, the, nest, itself, is, a, simple, scrape, in, the, ground, in, which, the, bird, typically, lays, three, or, four, eggs, the, young, of, most, species, are, precocial, the, family, scolopacidae, was, introduced, as, scolopacea, by, the, french, polymath, constantine, samuel, rafinesque, in, 1815, the, family, contains, 98, extant, or, recently, extinct, species, divided, into, 15, genera, for, more, details, see, the, article, list, of, sandpiper, species, the, following, genus, level, cladogram, of, the, scolopacidae, is, based, on, a, study, by, david, ern, and, rossy, natale, that, was, published, in, 2022, bartramia, upland, sandpiper, numenius, curlews, 9, species, limosa, godwits, 4,

early, fossil, record, is, scant, for, a, group, that, was, probably, present, at, the, non, avian, dinosaur, s, extinction, totanus, teruelensis, late, miocene, of, los, mansuetos, spain, is, sometimes, considered, a, scolopacid, maybe, a, shank, but, may, well, be, a, larid, little, is, known, of, it, paractitis, has, been, named, from, the, early, oligocene, of, saskatchewan, canada, while, mirolia, is, known, from, the, middle, miocene, at, deiningen, in, the, n, rdlinger, ries, germany, most, living, genera, would, seem, to, have, evolved, throughout, the, oligocene, to, miocene, with, the, waders, perhaps, a, bit, later, see, the, genus, accounts, for, the, fossil, record, in, addition, there, are, some, indeterminable, remains, that, might, belong, to, extant, genera, or, their, extinct, relatives, the, sandpipers, exhibit, considerable, range, in, size, and, appearance, the, wide, range, of, body, forms, reflecting, a, wide, range, of, ecological, niches, sandpipers, range, in, size, from, the, least, sandpiper, at, as, little, as, 18, grams, 0, 040, pounds, and, 11, cm, 4, 3, in, in, length, to, the, far, eastern, curlew, at, up, to, 66, cm, 26, in, in, length, and, the, eurasian, curlew, at, up, to, 1, 3, kg, 2, 9, lb, within, species, there, is, considerable, variation, in, patterns, of, sexual, dimorphism, males, are, larger, than, females, in, ruffs, and, several, sandpipers, but, are, smaller, than, females, in, the, knots, curlews, phalaropes, and, godwits, the, sexes, are, similarly, sized, in, the, snipes, woodcock, and, tringine, sandpipers, compared, to, the, other, large, family, of, wading, birds, the, plovers, charadriidae, they, tend, to, have, smaller, eyes, more, slender, heads, and, longer, thinner, bills, some, are, quite, long, legged, and, most, species, have, three, forward, pointing, toes, with, a, smaller, hind, toe, the, exception, is, the, sanderling, which, lacks, a, hind, toe, sandpipers, are, more, geared, towards, tactile, foraging, methods, than, the, plovers, which, favour, more, visual, foraging, methods, and, this, is, reflected, in, the, high, density, of, tactile, receptors, in, the, tips, of, their, bills, these, receptors, are, housed, in, a, slight, horny, swelling, at, the, tip, of, the, bill, except, for, the, surfbird, and, the, two, turnstones, bill, shape, is, highly, variable, within, the, family, reflecting, differences, in, feeding, ecology, bill, length, relative, to, head, length, varies, from, three, times, the, length, of, the, head, in, the, long, billed, curlew, to, just, under, half, the, head, length, in, the, tuamotu, sandpiper, bills, may, be, straight, slightly, upcurled, or, strongly, downcurved, like, all, birds, the, bills, of, sandpipers, are, capable, of, cranial, kinesis, literally, being, able, to, move, the, bones, of, the, skull, other, than, the, obvious, movement, of, the, lower, jaw, and, specifically, bending, the, upper, jaw, without, opening, the, entire, jaw, an, act, known, as, rhynchokinesis, it, has, been, hypothesized, this, helps, when, probing, by, allowing, the, bill, to, be, partly, opened, with, less, force, and, improving, manipulation, of, prey, items, in, the, substrate, rhynchokinesis, is, also, used, by, sandpipers, feeding, on, prey, in, water, to, catch, and, manipulate, prey, the, sandpipers, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, occurring, across, most, of, the, world, s, land, surfaces, except, for, antarctica, and, the, driest, deserts, a, majority, of, the, family, breed, at, moderate, to, high, latitudes, in, the, northern, hemisphere, in, fact, accounting, for, the, most, northerly, breeding, birds, in, the, world, only, a, few, species, breed, in, tropical, regions, ten, of, which, are, snipes, and, woodcocks, and, the, remaining, species, being, the, unusual, tuamotu, sandpiper, which, breeds, in, french, polynesia, although, prior, to, the, arrival, of, humans, in, the, pacific, there, were, several, other, closely, related, species, of, polynesian, sandpiper, there, are, broadly, four, feeding, styles, employed, by, the, sandpipers, although, many, species, are, flexible, and, may, use, more, than, one, style, the, first, is, pecking, with, occasional, probing, usually, done, by, species, in, drier, habitats, that, do, not, have, soft, soils, or, mud, the, second, and, most, frequent, method, employed, is, probing, soft, soils, muds, and, sands, for, prey, the, third, used, by, tringa, shanks, involves, running, in, shallow, water, with, the, bill, under, the, water, chasing, fish, a, method, that, uses, sight, as, well, as, tactile, senses, the, final, method, employed, by, the, phalaropes, and, some, calidris, sandpipers, involves, pecking, at, the, water, for, small, prey, a, few, species, of, scolopacids, are, omnivorous, to, some, extent, taking, seeds, and, shoots, as, well, as, invertebrates, many, sandpipers, form, monogamous, pairs, but, some, sandpipers, have, female, only, parental, care, some, male, only, parental, care, some, sequential, polyandry, and, other, compete, for, the, mate, on, the, lek, sandpipers, lay, three, or, four, eggs, into, the, nest, which, is, usually, a, vague, depression, or, scrape, in, the, open, ground, scarcely, lined, with, soft, vegetation, in, species, where, both, parents, incubate, the, eggs, females, and, males, share, their, incubation, duties, in, various, ways, both, within, and, between, species, in, some, pairs, parents, exchange, on, the, nest, in, the, morning, and, in, the, evening, so, that, their, incubation, rhythm, follows, a, 24, hour, day, in, others, each, sex, may, sit, on, the, nest, continuously, for, up, to, 24, hours, before, it, is, exchanged, by, its, partner, in, species, where, only, a, single, parent, incubates, the, eggs, during, the, night, the, parent, sits, on, the, eggs, nearly, continuously, and, then, during, the, warmest, part, of, a, day, leaves, the, nest, for, short, feeding, bouts, chicks, hatch, after, about, three, weeks, of, incubation, and, are, able, to, walk, and, forage, within, a, few, hours, of, hatching, a, single, parent, or, both, parents, guide, and, brood, the, chicks
