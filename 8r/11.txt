in, biology, the, word, gene, has, two, meanings, the, mendelian, gene, is, a, basic, unit, of, heredity, the, molecular, gene, is, a, sequence, of, nucleotides, in, dna, that, is, transcribed, to, produce, a, functional, rna, there, are, two, types, of, molecular, genes, protein, coding, genes, and, non, coding, genes, during, gene, expression, the, synthesis, of, rna, or, protein, from, a, gene, dna, is, first, copied, into, rna, rna, can, be, directly, functional, or, be, the, intermediate, template, for, the, synthesis, of, a, protein, the, transmission, of, genes, to, an, organism, s, offspring, is, the, basis, of, the, inheritance, of, phenotypic, traits, from, one, generation, to, the, next, these, genes, make, up, different, dna, sequences, together, called, a, genotype, that, is, specific, to, every, given, individual, within, the, gene, pool, of, a, population, of, a, given, species, the, genotype, along, with, environmental, and, developmental, factors, ultimately, determines, the, phenotype, of, the, individual, most, biological, traits, occur, under, the, combined, influence, of, polygenes, a, set, of, different, genes, and, gene, environment, interactions, some, genetic, traits, are, instantly, visible, such, as, eye, color, or, the, number, of, limbs, others, are, not, such, as, blood, type, the, risk, for, specific, diseases, or, the, thousands, of, basic, biochemical, processes, that, constitute, life, a, gene, can, acquire, mutations, in, its, sequence, leading, to, different, variants, known, as, alleles, in, the, population, these, alleles, encode, slightly, different, versions, of, a, gene, which, may, cause, different, phenotypical, traits, genes, evolve, due, to, natural, selection, or, survival, of, the, fittest, and, genetic, drift, of, the, alleles, the, term, gene, was, introduced, by, danish, botanist, plant, physiologist, and, geneticist, wilhelm, johannsen, in, 1909, it, is, inspired, by, the, ancient, greek, gonos, that, means, offspring, and, procreation, there, are, many, different, ways, to, use, the, term, gene, based, on, different, aspects, of, their, inheritance, selection, biological, function, or, molecular, structure, but, most, of, these, definitions, fall, into, two, categories, the, mendelian, gene, or, the, molecular, gene, the, mendelian, gene, is, the, classical, gene, of, genetics, and, it, refers, to, any, heritable, trait, this, is, the, gene, described, in, the, selfish, gene, more, thorough, discussions, of, this, version, of, a, gene, can, be, found, in, the, articles, genetics, and, gene, centered, view, of, evolution, the, molecular, gene, definition, is, more, commonly, used, across, biochemistry, molecular, biology, and, most, of, genetics, the, gene, that, is, described, in, terms, of, dna, sequence, there, are, many, different, definitions, of, this, gene, some, of, which, are, misleading, or, incorrect, very, early, work, in, the, field, that, became, molecular, genetics, suggested, the, concept, that, one, gene, makes, one, protein, originally, one, gene, one, enzyme, however, genes, that, produce, repressor, rnas, were, proposed, in, the, 1950s, and, by, the, 1960s, textbooks, were, using, molecular, gene, definitions, that, included, those, that, specified, functional, rna, molecules, such, as, ribosomal, rna, and, trna, noncoding, genes, as, well, as, protein, coding, genes, this, idea, of, two, kinds, of, genes, is, still, part, of, the, definition, of, a, gene, in, most, textbooks, for, example, the, primary, function, of, the, genome, is, to, produce, rna, molecules, selected, portions, of, the, dna, nucleotide, sequence, are, copied, into, a, corresponding, rna, nucleotide, sequence, which, either, encodes, a, protein, if, it, is, an, mrna, or, forms, a, structural, rna, such, as, a, transfer, rna, trna, or, ribosomal, rna, rrna, molecule, each, region, of, the, dna, helix, that, produces, a, functional, rna, molecule, constitutes, a, gene, we, define, a, gene, as, a, dna, sequence, that, is, transcribed, this, definition, includes, genes, that, do, not, encode, proteins, not, all, transcripts, are, messenger, rna, the, definition, normally, excludes, regions, of, the, genome, that, control, transcription, but, are, not, themselves, transcribed, we, will, encounter, some, exceptions, to, our, definition, of, a, gene, surprisingly, there, is, no, definition, that, is, entirely, satisfactory, a, gene, is, a, dna, sequence, that, codes, for, a, diffusible, product, this, product, may, be, protein, as, is, the, case, in, the, majority, of, genes, or, may, be, rna, as, is, the, case, of, genes, that, code, for, trna, and, rrna, the, crucial, feature, is, that, the, product, diffuses, away, from, its, site, of, synthesis, to, act, elsewhere, the, important, parts, of, such, definitions, are, 1, that, a, gene, corresponds, to, a, transcription, unit, 2, that, genes, produce, both, mrna, and, noncoding, rnas, and, 3, regulatory, sequences, control, gene, expression, but, are, not, part, of, the, gene, itself, however, there, s, one, other, important, part, of, the, definition, and, it, is, emphasized, in, kostas, kampourakis, book, making, sense, of, genes, therefore, in, this, book, i, will, consider, genes, as, dna, sequences, encoding, information, for, functional, products, be, it, proteins, or, rna, molecules, with, encoding, information, i, mean, that, the, dna, sequence, is, used, as, a, template, for, the, production, of, an, rna, molecule, or, a, protein, that, performs, some, function, the, emphasis, on, function, is, essential, because, there, are, stretches, of, dna, that, produce, non, functional, transcripts, and, they, do, not, qualify, as, genes, these, include, obvious, examples, such, as, transcribed, pseudogenes, as, well, as, less, obvious, examples, such, as, junk, rna, produced, as, noise, due, to, transcription, errors, in, order, to, qualify, as, a, true, gene, by, this, definition, one, has, to, prove, that, the, transcript, has, a, biological, function, early, speculations, on, the, size, of, a, typical, gene, were, based, on, high, resolution, genetic, mapping, and, on, the, size, of, proteins, and, rna, molecules, a, length, of, 1500, base, pairs, seemed, reasonable, at, the, time, 1965, this, was, based, on, the, idea, that, the, gene, was, the, dna, that, was, directly, responsible, for, production, of, the, functional, product, the, discovery, of, introns, in, the, 1970s, meant, that, many, eukaryotic, genes, were, much, larger, than, the, size, of, the, functional, product, would, imply, typical, mammalian, protein, coding, genes, for, example, are, about, 62, 000, base, pairs, in, length, transcribed, region, and, since, there, are, about, 20, 000, of, them, they, occupy, about, 35, 40, of, the, mammalian, genome, including, the, human, genome, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, both, protein, coding, genes, and, noncoding, genes, have, been, known, for, more, than, 50, years, there, are, still, a, number, of, textbooks, websites, and, scientific, publications, that, define, a, gene, as, a, dna, sequence, that, specifies, a, protein, in, other, words, the, definition, is, restricted, to, protein, coding, genes, here, is, an, example, from, a, recent, article, in, american, scientist, to, truly, assess, the, potential, significance, of, de, novo, genes, we, relied, on, a, strict, definition, of, the, word, gene, with, which, nearly, every, expert, can, agree, first, in, order, for, a, nucleotide, sequence, to, be, considered, a, true, gene, an, open, reading, frame, orf, must, be, present, the, orf, can, be, thought, of, as, the, gene, itself, it, begins, with, a, starting, mark, common, for, every, gene, and, ends, with, one, of, three, possible, finish, line, signals, one, of, the, key, enzymes, in, this, process, the, rna, polymerase, zips, along, the, strand, of, dna, like, a, train, on, a, monorail, transcribing, it, into, its, messenger, rna, form, this, point, brings, us, to, our, second, important, criterion, a, true, gene, is, one, that, is, both, transcribed, and, translated, that, is, a, true, gene, is, first, used, as, a, template, to, make, transient, messenger, rna, which, is, then, translated, into, a, protein, this, restricted, definition, is, so, common, that, it, has, spawned, many, recent, articles, that, criticize, this, standard, definition, and, call, for, a, new, expanded, definition, that, includes, noncoding, genes, however, this, so, called, new, definition, has, been, around, for, more, than, half, a, century, and, it, is, not, clear, why, some, modern, writers, are, ignoring, noncoding, genes, although, some, definitions, can, be, more, broadly, applicable, than, others, the, fundamental, complexity, of, biology, means, that, no, definition, of, a, gene, can, capture, all, aspects, perfectly, not, all, genomes, are, dna, e, g, rna, viruses, bacterial, operons, are, multiple, protein, coding, regions, transcribed, into, single, large, mrnas, alternative, splicing, enables, a, single, genomic, region, to, encode, multiple, district, products, and, trans, splicing, concatenates, mrnas, from, shorter, coding, sequence, across, the, genome, since, molecular, definitions, exclude, elements, such, as, introns, promotors, and, other, regulatory, regions, these, are, instead, thought, of, as, associated, with, the, gene, and, affect, its, function, an, even, broader, operational, definition, is, sometimes, used, to, encompass, the, complexity, of, these, diverse, phenomena, where, a, gene, is, defined, as, a, union, of, genomic, sequences, encoding, a, coherent, set, of, potentially, overlapping, functional, products, this, definition, categorizes, genes, by, their, functional, products, proteins, or, rna, rather, than, their, specific, dna, loci, with, regulatory, elements, classified, as, gene, associated, regions, the, existence, of, discrete, inheritable, units, was, first, suggested, by, gregor, mendel, 1822, 1884, from, 1857, to, 1864, in, brno, austrian, empire, today, s, czech, republic, he, studied, inheritance, patterns, in, 8000, common, edible, pea, plants, tracking, distinct, traits, from, parent, to, offspring, he, described, these, mathematically, as, 2, n, combinations, where, n, is, the, number, of, differing, characteristics, in, the, original, peas, although, he, did, not, use, the, term, gene, he, explained, his, results, in, terms, of, discrete, inherited, units, that, give, rise, to, observable, physical, characteristics, this, description, prefigured, wilhelm, johannsen, s, distinction, between, genotype, the, genetic, material, of, an, organism, and, phenotype, the, observable, traits, of, that, organism, mendel, was, also, the, first, to, demonstrate, independent, assortment, the, distinction, between, dominant, and, recessive, traits, the, distinction, between, a, heterozygote, and, homozygote, and, the, phenomenon, of, discontinuous, inheritance, prior, to, mendel, s, work, the, dominant, theory, of, heredity, was, one, of, blending, inheritance, which, suggested, that, each, parent, contributed, fluids, to, the, fertilization, process, and, that, the, traits, of, the, parents, blended, and, mixed, to, produce, the, offspring, charles, darwin, developed, a, theory, of, inheritance, he, termed, pangenesis, from, greek, pan, all, whole, and, genesis, birth, genos, origin, darwin, used, the, term, gemmule, to, describe, hypothetical, particles, that, would, mix, during, reproduction, mendel, s, work, went, largely, unnoticed, after, its, first, publication, in, 1866, but, was, rediscovered, in, the, late, 19th, century, by, hugo, de, vries, carl, correns, and, erich, von, tschermak, who, claimed, to, have, reached, similar, conclusions, in, their, own, research, specifically, in, 1889, hugo, de, vries, published, his, book, intracellular, pangenesis, in, which, he, postulated, that, different, characters, have, individual, hereditary, carriers, and, that, inheritance, of, specific, traits, in, organisms, comes, in, particles, de, vries, called, these, units, pangenes, pangens, in, german, after, darwin, s, 1868, pangenesis, theory, twenty, years, later, in, 1909, wilhelm, johannsen, introduced, the, term, gene, and, in, 1906, william, bateson, that, of, genetics, while, eduard, strasburger, among, others, still, used, the, term, pangene, for, the, fundamental, physical, and, functional, unit, of, heredity, translator, s, preface, viii, advances, in, understanding, genes, and, inheritance, continued, throughout, the, 20th, century, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, was, shown, to, be, the, molecular, repository, of, genetic, information, by, experiments, in, the, 1940s, to, 1950s, the, structure, of, dna, was, studied, by, rosalind, franklin, and, maurice, wilkins, using, x, ray, crystallography, which, led, james, d, watson, and, francis, crick, to, publish, a, model, of, the, double, stranded, dna, molecule, whose, paired, nucleotide, bases, indicated, a, compelling, hypothesis, for, the, mechanism, of, genetic, replication, in, the, early, 1950s, the, prevailing, view, was, that, the, genes, in, a, chromosome, acted, like, discrete, entities, arranged, like, beads, on, a, string, the, experiments, of, benzer, using, mutants, defective, in, the, rii, region, of, bacteriophage, t4, 1955, 1959, showed, that, individual, genes, have, a, simple, linear, structure, and, are, likely, to, be, equivalent, to, a, linear, section, of, dna, collectively, this, body, of, research, established, the, central, dogma, of, molecular, biology, which, states, that, proteins, are, translated, from, rna, which, is, transcribed, from, dna, this, dogma, has, since, been, shown, to, have, exceptions, such, as, reverse, transcription, in, retroviruses, the, modern, study, of, genetics, at, the, level, of, dna, is, known, as, molecular, genetics, in, 1972, walter, fiers, and, his, team, were, the, first, to, determine, the, sequence, of, a, gene, that, of, bacteriophage, ms2, coat, protein, the, subsequent, development, of, chain, termination, dna, sequencing, in, 1977, by, frederick, sanger, improved, the, efficiency, of, sequencing, and, turned, it, into, a, routine, laboratory, tool, an, automated, version, of, the, sanger, method, was, used, in, early, phases, of, the, human, genome, project, the, theories, developed, in, the, early, 20th, century, to, integrate, mendelian, genetics, with, darwinian, evolution, are, called, the, modern, synthesis, a, term, introduced, by, julian, huxley, this, view, of, evolution, was, emphasized, by, george, c, williams, gene, centric, view, of, evolution, he, proposed, that, the, mendelian, gene, is, a, unit, of, natural, selection, with, the, definition, that, which, segregates, and, recombines, with, appreciable, frequency, 24, related, ideas, emphasizing, the, centrality, of, mendelian, genes, and, the, importance, of, natural, selection, in, evolution, were, popularized, by, richard, dawkins, the, development, of, the, neutral, theory, of, evolution, in, the, late, 1960s, led, to, the, recognition, that, random, genetic, drift, is, a, major, player, in, evolution, and, that, neutral, theory, should, be, the, null, hypothesis, of, molecular, evolution, this, led, to, the, construction, of, phylogenetic, trees, and, the, development, of, the, molecular, clock, which, is, the, basis, of, all, dating, techniques, using, dna, sequences, these, techniques, are, not, confined, to, molecular, gene, sequences, but, can, be, used, on, all, dna, segments, in, the, genome, the, vast, majority, of, organisms, encode, their, genes, in, long, strands, of, dna, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, consists, of, a, chain, made, from, four, types, of, nucleotide, subunits, each, composed, of, a, five, carbon, sugar, 2, deoxyribose, a, phosphate, group, and, one, of, the, four, bases, adenine, cytosine, guanine, and, thymine, 2, 1, two, chains, of, dna, twist, around, each, other, to, form, a, dna, double, helix, with, the, phosphate, sugar, backbone, spiraling, around, the, outside, and, the, bases, pointing, inward, with, adenine, base, pairing, to, thymine, and, guanine, to, cytosine, the, specificity, of, base, pairing, occurs, because, adenine, and, thymine, align, to, form, two, hydrogen, bonds, whereas, cytosine, and, guanine, form, three, hydrogen, bonds, the, two, strands, in, a, double, helix, must, therefore, be, complementary, with, their, sequence, of, bases, matching, such, that, the, adenines, of, one, strand, are, paired, with, the, thymines, of, the, other, strand, and, so, on, 4, 1, due, to, the, chemical, composition, of, the, pentose, residues, of, the, bases, dna, strands, have, directionality, one, end, of, a, dna, polymer, contains, an, exposed, hydroxyl, group, on, the, deoxyribose, this, is, known, as, the, 3, end, of, the, molecule, the, other, end, contains, an, exposed, phosphate, group, this, is, the, 5, end, the, two, strands, of, a, double, helix, run, in, opposite, directions, nucleic, acid, synthesis, including, dna, replication, and, transcription, occurs, in, the, 5, 3, direction, because, new, nucleotides, are, added, via, a, dehydration, reaction, that, uses, the, exposed, 3, hydroxyl, as, a, nucleophile, 27, 2, the, expression, of, genes, encoded, in, dna, begins, by, transcribing, the, gene, into, rna, a, second, type, of, nucleic, acid, that, is, very, similar, to, dna, but, whose, monomers, contain, the, sugar, ribose, rather, than, deoxyribose, rna, also, contains, the, base, uracil, in, place, of, thymine, rna, molecules, are, less, stable, than, dna, and, are, typically, single, stranded, genes, that, encode, proteins, are, composed, of, a, series, of, three, nucleotide, sequences, called, codons, which, serve, as, the, words, in, the, genetic, language, the, genetic, code, specifies, the, correspondence, during, protein, translation, between, codons, and, amino, acids, the, genetic, code, is, nearly, the, same, for, all, known, organisms, 4, 1, the, total, complement, of, genes, in, an, organism, or, cell, is, known, as, its, genome, which, may, be, stored, on, one, or, more, chromosomes, a, chromosome, consists, of, a, single, very, long, dna, helix, on, which, thousands, of, genes, are, encoded, 4, 2, the, region, of, the, chromosome, at, which, a, particular, gene, is, located, is, called, its, locus, each, locus, contains, one, allele, of, a, gene, however, members, of, a, population, may, have, different, alleles, at, the, locus, each, with, a, slightly, different, gene, sequence, the, majority, of, eukaryotic, genes, are, stored, on, a, set, of, large, linear, chromosomes, the, chromosomes, are, packed, within, the, nucleus, in, complex, with, storage, proteins, called, histones, to, form, a, unit, called, a, nucleosome, dna, packaged, and, condensed, in, this, way, is, called, chromatin, 4, 2, the, manner, in, which, dna, is, stored, on, the, histones, as, well, as, chemical, modifications, of, the, histone, itself, regulate, whether, a, particular, region, of, dna, is, accessible, for, gene, expression, in, addition, to, genes, eukaryotic, chromosomes, contain, sequences, involved, in, ensuring, that, the, dna, is, copied, without, degradation, of, end, regions, and, sorted, into, daughter, cells, during, cell, division, replication, origins, telomeres, and, the, centromere, 4, 2, replication, origins, are, the, sequence, regions, where, dna, replication, is, initiated, to, make, two, copies, of, the, chromosome, telomeres, are, long, stretches, of, repetitive, sequences, that, cap, the, ends, of, the, linear, chromosomes, and, prevent, degradation, of, coding, and, regulatory, regions, during, dna, replication, the, length, of, the, telomeres, decreases, each, time, the, genome, is, replicated, and, has, been, implicated, in, the, aging, process, the, centromere, is, required, for, binding, spindle, fibres, to, separate, sister, chromatids, into, daughter, cells, during, cell, division, 18, 2, prokaryotes, bacteria, and, archaea, typically, store, their, genomes, on, a, single, large, circular, chromosome, similarly, some, eukaryotic, organelles, contain, a, remnant, circular, chromosome, with, a, small, number, of, genes, 14, 4, prokaryotes, sometimes, supplement, their, chromosome, with, additional, small, circles, of, dna, called, plasmids, which, usually, encode, only, a, few, genes, and, are, transferable, between, individuals, for, example, the, genes, for, antibiotic, resistance, are, usually, encoded, on, bacterial, plasmids, and, can, be, passed, between, individual, cells, even, those, of, different, species, via, horizontal, gene, transfer, whereas, the, chromosomes, of, prokaryotes, are, relatively, gene, dense, those, of, eukaryotes, often, contain, regions, of, dna, that, serve, no, obvious, function, simple, single, celled, eukaryotes, have, relatively, small, amounts, of, such, dna, whereas, the, genomes, of, complex, multicellular, organisms, including, humans, contain, an, absolute, majority, of, dna, without, an, identified, function, this, dna, has, often, been, referred, to, as, junk, dna, however, more, recent, analyses, suggest, that, although, protein, coding, dna, makes, up, barely, 2, of, the, human, genome, about, 80, of, the, bases, in, the, genome, may, be, expressed, so, the, term, junk, dna, may, be, a, misnomer, the, structure, of, a, protein, coding, gene, consists, of, many, elements, of, which, the, actual, protein, coding, sequence, is, often, only, a, small, part, these, include, introns, and, untranslated, regions, of, the, mature, mrna, noncoding, genes, can, also, contain, introns, that, are, removed, during, processing, to, produce, the, mature, functional, rna, all, genes, are, associated, with, regulatory, sequences, that, are, required, for, their, expression, first, genes, require, a, promoter, sequence, the, promoter, is, recognized, and, bound, by, transcription, factors, that, recruit, and, help, rna, polymerase, bind, to, the, region, to, initiate, transcription, 7, 1, the, recognition, typically, occurs, as, a, consensus, sequence, like, the, tata, box, a, gene, can, have, more, than, one, promoter, resulting, in, messenger, rnas, mrna, that, differ, in, how, far, they, extend, in, the, 5, end, highly, transcribed, genes, have, strong, promoter, sequences, that, form, strong, associations, with, transcription, factors, thereby, initiating, transcription, at, a, high, rate, others, genes, have, weak, promoters, that, form, weak, associations, with, transcription, factors, and, initiate, transcription, less, frequently, 7, 2, eukaryotic, promoter, regions, are, much, more, complex, and, difficult, to, identify, than, prokaryotic, promoters, 7, 3, additionally, genes, can, have, regulatory, regions, many, kilobases, upstream, or, downstream, of, the, gene, that, alter, expression, these, act, by, binding, to, transcription, factors, which, then, cause, the, dna, to, loop, so, that, the, regulatory, sequence, and, bound, transcription, factor, become, close, to, the, rna, polymerase, binding, site, for, example, enhancers, increase, transcription, by, binding, an, activator, protein, which, then, helps, to, recruit, the, rna, polymerase, to, the, promoter, conversely, silencers, bind, repressor, proteins, and, make, the, dna, less, available, for, rna, polymerase, the, mature, messenger, rna, produced, from, protein, coding, genes, contains, untranslated, regions, at, both, ends, which, contain, binding, sites, for, ribosomes, rna, binding, proteins, mirna, as, well, as, terminator, and, start, and, stop, codons, in, addition, most, eukaryotic, open, reading, frames, contain, untranslated, introns, which, are, removed, and, exons, which, are, connected, together, in, a, process, known, as, rna, splicing, finally, the, ends, of, gene, transcripts, are, defined, by, cleavage, and, polyadenylation, cpa, sites, where, newly, produced, pre, mrna, gets, cleaved, and, a, string, of, 200, adenosine, monophosphates, is, added, at, the, 3, end, the, poly, a, tail, protects, mature, mrna, from, degradation, and, has, other, functions, affecting, translation, localization, and, transport, of, the, transcript, from, the, nucleus, splicing, followed, by, cpa, generate, the, final, mature, mrna, which, encodes, the, protein, or, rna, product, many, noncoding, genes, in, eukaryotes, have, different, transcription, termination, mechanisms, and, they, do, not, have, poly, a, tails, many, prokaryotic, genes, are, organized, into, operons, with, multiple, protein, coding, sequences, that, are, transcribed, as, a, unit, the, genes, in, an, operon, are, transcribed, as, a, continuous, messenger, rna, referred, to, as, a, polycistronic, mrna, the, term, cistron, in, this, context, is, equivalent, to, gene, the, transcription, of, an, operon, s, mrna, is, often, controlled, by, a, repressor, that, can, occur, in, an, active, or, inactive, state, depending, on, the, presence, of, specific, metabolites, when, active, the, repressor, binds, to, a, dna, sequence, at, the, beginning, of, the, operon, called, the, operator, region, and, represses, transcription, of, the, operon, when, the, repressor, is, inactive, transcription, of, the, operon, can, occur, see, e, g, lac, operon, the, products, of, operon, genes, typically, have, related, functions, and, are, involved, in, the, same, regulatory, network, 7, 3, though, many, genes, have, simple, structures, as, with, much, of, biology, others, can, be, quite, complex, or, represent, unusual, edge, cases, eukaryotic, genes, often, have, introns, are, often, much, larger, than, their, exons, and, those, introns, can, even, have, other, genes, nested, inside, them, associated, enhancers, may, be, many, kilobase, away, or, even, on, entirely, different, chromosomes, operating, via, physical, contact, between, two, chromosomes, a, single, gene, can, encode, multiple, different, functional, products, by, alternative, splicing, and, conversely, gene, may, be, split, across, chromosomes, but, those, transcripts, are, concatenated, back, together, into, a, functional, sequence, by, trans, splicing, it, is, also, possible, for, overlapping, genes, to, share, some, of, their, dna, sequence, either, on, opposite, strands, or, the, same, strand, in, a, different, reading, frame, or, even, the, same, reading, frame, in, all, organisms, two, steps, are, required, to, read, the, information, encoded, in, a, gene, s, dna, and, produce, the, protein, it, specifies, first, the, gene, s, dna, is, transcribed, to, messenger, rna, mrna, 6, 1, second, that, mrna, is, translated, to, protein, 6, 2, rna, coding, genes, must, still, go, through, the, first, step, but, are, not, translated, into, protein, the, process, of, producing, a, biologically, functional, molecule, of, either, rna, or, protein, is, called, gene, expression, and, the, resulting, molecule, is, called, a, gene, product, the, nucleotide, sequence, of, a, gene, s, dna, specifies, the, amino, acid, sequence, of, a, protein, through, the, genetic, code, sets, of, three, nucleotides, known, as, codons, each, correspond, to, a, specific, amino, acid, 6, the, principle, that, three, sequential, bases, of, dna, code, for, each, amino, acid, was, demonstrated, in, 1961, using, frameshift, mutations, in, the, riib, gene, of, bacteriophage, t4, see, crick, brenner, et, al, experiment, additionally, a, start, codon, and, three, stop, codons, indicate, the, beginning, and, end, of, the, protein, coding, region, there, are, 64, possible, codons, four, possible, nucleotides, at, each, of, three, positions, hence, 4, 3, possible, codons, and, only, 20, standard, amino, acids, hence, the, code, is, redundant, and, multiple, codons, can, specify, the, same, amino, acid, the, correspondence, between, codons, and, amino, acids, is, nearly, universal, among, all, known, living, organisms, transcription, produces, a, single, stranded, rna, molecule, known, as, messenger, rna, whose, nucleotide, sequence, is, complementary, to, the, dna, from, which, it, was, transcribed, 6, 1, the, mrna, acts, as, an, intermediate, between, the, dna, gene, and, its, final, protein, product, the, gene, s, dna, is, used, as, a, template, to, generate, a, complementary, mrna, the, mrna, matches, the, sequence, of, the, gene, s, dna, coding, strand, because, it, is, synthesised, as, the, complement, of, the, template, strand, transcription, is, performed, by, an, enzyme, called, an, rna, polymerase, which, reads, the, template, strand, in, the, 3, to, 5, direction, and, synthesizes, the, rna, from, 5, to, 3, to, initiate, transcription, the, polymerase, first, recognizes, and, binds, a, promoter, region, of, the, gene, thus, a, major, mechanism, of, gene, regulation, is, the, blocking, or, sequestering, the, promoter, region, either, by, tight, binding, by, repressor, molecules, that, physically, block, the, polymerase, or, by, organizing, the, dna, so, that, the, promoter, region, is, not, accessible, 7, in, prokaryotes, transcription, occurs, in, the, cytoplasm, for, very, long, transcripts, translation, may, begin, at, the, 5, end, of, the, rna, while, the, 3, end, is, still, being, transcribed, in, eukaryotes, transcription, occurs, in, the, nucleus, where, the, cell, s, dna, is, stored, the, rna, molecule, produced, by, the, polymerase, is, known, as, the, primary, transcript, and, undergoes, post, transcriptional, modifications, before, being, exported, to, the, cytoplasm, for, translation, one, of, the, modifications, performed, is, the, splicing, of, introns, which, are, sequences, in, the, transcribed, region, that, do, not, encode, a, protein, alternative, splicing, mechanisms, can, result, in, mature, transcripts, from, the, same, gene, having, different, sequences, and, thus, coding, for, different, proteins, this, is, a, major, form, of, regulation, in, eukaryotic, cells, and, also, occurs, in, some, prokaryotes, 7, 5, translation, is, the, process, by, which, a, mature, mrna, molecule, is, used, as, a, template, for, synthesizing, a, new, protein, 6, 2, translation, is, carried, out, by, ribosomes, large, complexes, of, rna, and, protein, responsible, for, carrying, out, the, chemical, reactions, to, add, new, amino, acids, to, a, growing, polypeptide, chain, by, the, formation, of, peptide, bonds, the, genetic, code, is, read, three, nucleotides, at, a, time, in, units, called, codons, via, interactions, with, specialized, rna, molecules, called, transfer, rna, trna, each, trna, has, three, unpaired, bases, known, as, the, anticodon, that, are, complementary, to, the, codon, it, reads, on, the, mrna, the, trna, is, also, covalently, attached, to, the, amino, acid, specified, by, the, complementary, codon, when, the, trna, binds, to, its, complementary, codon, in, an, mrna, strand, the, ribosome, attaches, its, amino, acid, cargo, to, the, new, polypeptide, chain, which, is, synthesized, from, amino, terminus, to, carboxyl, terminus, during, and, after, synthesis, most, new, proteins, must, fold, to, their, active, three, dimensional, structure, before, they, can, carry, out, their, cellular, functions, 3, genes, are, regulated, so, that, they, are, expressed, only, when, the, product, is, needed, since, expression, draws, on, limited, resources, 7, a, cell, regulates, its, gene, expression, depending, on, its, external, environment, e, g, available, nutrients, temperature, and, other, stresses, its, internal, environment, e, g, cell, division, cycle, metabolism, infection, status, and, its, specific, role, if, in, a, multicellular, organism, gene, expression, can, be, regulated, at, any, step, from, transcriptional, initiation, to, rna, processing, to, post, translational, modification, of, the, protein, the, regulation, of, lactose, metabolism, genes, in, e, coli, lac, operon, was, the, first, such, mechanism, to, be, described, in, 1961, a, typical, protein, coding, gene, is, first, copied, into, rna, as, an, intermediate, in, the, manufacture, of, the, final, protein, product, 6, 1, in, other, cases, the, rna, molecules, are, the, actual, functional, products, as, in, the, synthesis, of, ribosomal, rna, and, transfer, rna, some, rnas, known, as, ribozymes, are, capable, of, enzymatic, function, while, others, such, as, micrornas, and, riboswitches, have, regulatory, roles, the, dna, sequences, from, which, such, rnas, are, transcribed, are, known, as, non, coding, rna, genes, some, viruses, store, their, entire, genomes, in, the, form, of, rna, and, contain, no, dna, at, all, because, they, use, rna, to, store, genes, their, cellular, hosts, may, synthesize, their, proteins, as, soon, as, they, are, infected, and, without, the, delay, in, waiting, for, transcription, on, the, other, hand, rna, retroviruses, such, as, hiv, require, the, reverse, transcription, of, their, genome, from, rna, into, dna, before, their, proteins, can, be, synthesized, organisms, inherit, their, genes, from, their, parents, asexual, organisms, simply, inherit, a, complete, copy, of, their, parent, s, genome, sexual, organisms, have, two, copies, of, each, chromosome, because, they, inherit, one, complete, set, from, each, parent, 1, according, to, mendelian, inheritance, variations, in, an, organism, s, phenotype, observable, physical, and, behavioral, characteristics, are, due, in, part, to, variations, in, its, genotype, particular, set, of, genes, each, gene, specifies, a, particular, trait, with, a, different, sequence, of, a, gene, alleles, giving, rise, to, different, phenotypes, most, eukaryotic, organisms, such, as, the, pea, plants, mendel, worked, on, have, two, alleles, for, each, trait, one, inherited, from, each, parent, 20, alleles, at, a, locus, may, be, dominant, or, recessive, dominant, alleles, give, rise, to, their, corresponding, phenotypes, when, paired, with, any, other, allele, for, the, same, trait, whereas, recessive, alleles, give, rise, to, their, corresponding, phenotype, only, when, paired, with, another, copy, of, the, same, allele, if, you, know, the, genotypes, of, the, organisms, you, can, determine, which, alleles, are, dominant, and, which, are, recessive, for, example, if, the, allele, specifying, tall, stems, in, pea, plants, is, dominant, over, the, allele, specifying, short, stems, then, pea, plants, that, inherit, one, tall, allele, from, one, parent, and, one, short, allele, from, the, other, parent, will, also, have, tall, stems, mendel, s, work, demonstrated, that, alleles, assort, independently, in, the, production, of, gametes, or, germ, cells, ensuring, variation, in, the, next, generation, although, mendelian, inheritance, remains, a, good, model, for, many, traits, determined, by, single, genes, including, a, number, of, well, known, genetic, disorders, it, does, not, include, the, physical, processes, of, dna, replication, and, cell, division, the, growth, development, and, reproduction, of, organisms, relies, on, cell, division, the, process, by, which, a, single, cell, divides, into, two, usually, identical, daughter, cells, this, requires, first, making, a, duplicate, copy, of, every, gene, in, the, genome, in, a, process, called, dna, replication, 5, 2, the, copies, are, made, by, specialized, enzymes, known, as, dna, polymerases, which, reads, one, strand, of, the, double, helical, dna, known, as, the, template, strand, and, synthesize, a, new, complementary, strand, because, the, dna, double, helix, is, held, together, by, base, pairing, the, sequence, of, one, strand, completely, specifies, the, sequence, of, its, complement, hence, only, one, strand, needs, to, be, read, by, the, enzyme, to, produce, a, faithful, copy, the, process, of, dna, replication, is, semiconservative, that, is, the, copy, of, the, genome, inherited, by, each, daughter, cell, contains, one, original, and, one, newly, synthesized, strand, of, dna, 5, 2, the, rate, of, dna, replication, in, living, cells, was, first, measured, as, the, rate, of, phage, t4, dna, elongation, in, phage, infected, e, coli, and, found, to, be, impressively, rapid, during, the, period, of, exponential, dna, increase, at, 37, c, the, rate, of, elongation, was, 749, nucleotides, per, second, after, dna, replication, is, complete, the, cell, must, physically, separate, the, two, copies, of, the, genome, and, divide, into, two, distinct, membrane, bound, cells, 18, 2, in, prokaryotes, bacteria, and, archaea, this, usually, occurs, via, a, relatively, simple, process, called, binary, fission, in, which, each, circular, genome, attaches, to, the, cell, membrane, and, is, separated, into, the, daughter, cells, as, the, membrane, invaginates, to, split, the, cytoplasm, into, two, membrane, bound, portions, binary, fission, is, extremely, fast, compared, to, the, rates, of, cell, division, in, eukaryotes, eukaryotic, cell, division, is, a, more, complex, process, known, as, the, cell, cycle, dna, replication, occurs, during, a, phase, of, this, cycle, known, as, s, phase, whereas, the, process, of, segregating, chromosomes, and, splitting, the, cytoplasm, occurs, during, m, phase, 18, 1, the, duplication, and, transmission, of, genetic, material, from, one, generation, of, cells, to, the, next, is, the, basis, for, molecular, inheritance, and, the, link, between, the, classical, and, molecular, pictures, of, genes, organisms, inherit, the, characteristics, of, their, parents, because, the, cells, of, the, offspring, contain, copies, of, the, genes, in, their, parents, cells, in, asexually, reproducing, organisms, the, offspring, will, be, a, genetic, copy, or, clone, of, the, parent, organism, in, sexually, reproducing, organisms, a, specialized, form, of, cell, division, called, meiosis, produces, cells, called, gametes, or, germ, cells, that, are, haploid, or, contain, only, one, copy, of, each, gene, 20, 2, the, gametes, produced, by, females, are, called, eggs, or, ova, and, those, produced, by, males, are, called, sperm, two, gametes, fuse, to, form, a, diploid, fertilized, egg, a, single, cell, that, has, two, sets, of, genes, with, one, copy, of, each, gene, from, the, mother, and, one, from, the, father, 20, during, the, process, of, meiotic, cell, division, an, event, called, genetic, recombination, or, crossing, over, can, sometimes, occur, in, which, a, length, of, dna, on, one, chromatid, is, swapped, with, a, length, of, dna, on, the, corresponding, homologous, non, sister, chromatid, this, can, result, in, reassortment, of, otherwise, linked, alleles, 5, 5, the, mendelian, principle, of, independent, assortment, asserts, that, each, of, a, parent, s, two, genes, for, each, trait, will, sort, independently, into, gametes, which, allele, an, organism, inherits, for, one, trait, is, unrelated, to, which, allele, it, inherits, for, another, trait, this, is, in, fact, only, true, for, genes, that, do, not, reside, on, the, same, chromosome, or, are, located, very, far, from, one, another, on, the, same, chromosome, the, closer, two, genes, lie, on, the, same, chromosome, the, more, closely, they, will, be, associated, in, gametes, and, the, more, often, they, will, appear, together, known, as, genetic, linkage, genes, that, are, very, close, are, essentially, never, separated, because, it, is, extremely, unlikely, that, a, crossover, point, will, occur, between, them, dna, replication, is, for, the, most, part, extremely, accurate, however, errors, mutations, do, occur, 7, 6, the, error, rate, in, eukaryotic, cells, can, be, as, low, as, 10, 8, per, nucleotide, per, replication, whereas, for, some, rna, viruses, it, can, be, as, high, as, 10, 3, this, means, that, each, generation, each, human, genome, accumulates, around, 30, new, mutations, small, mutations, can, be, caused, by, dna, replication, and, the, aftermath, of, dna, damage, and, include, point, mutations, in, which, a, single, base, is, altered, and, frameshift, mutations, in, which, a, single, base, is, inserted, or, deleted, either, of, these, mutations, can, change, the, gene, by, missense, change, a, codon, to, encode, a, different, amino, acid, or, nonsense, a, premature, stop, codon, larger, mutations, can, be, caused, by, errors, in, recombination, to, cause, chromosomal, abnormalities, including, the, duplication, deletion, rearrangement, or, inversion, of, large, sections, of, a, chromosome, additionally, dna, repair, mechanisms, can, introduce, mutational, errors, when, repairing, physical, damage, to, the, molecule, the, repair, even, with, mutation, is, more, important, to, survival, than, restoring, an, exact, copy, for, example, when, repairing, double, strand, breaks, 5, 4, when, multiple, different, alleles, for, a, gene, are, present, in, a, species, s, population, it, is, called, polymorphic, most, different, alleles, are, functionally, equivalent, however, some, alleles, can, give, rise, to, different, phenotypic, traits, a, gene, s, most, common, allele, is, called, the, wild, type, and, rare, alleles, are, called, mutants, the, genetic, variation, in, relative, frequencies, of, different, alleles, in, a, population, is, due, to, both, natural, selection, and, genetic, drift, the, wild, type, allele, is, not, necessarily, the, ancestor, of, less, common, alleles, nor, is, it, necessarily, fitter, most, mutations, within, genes, are, neutral, having, no, effect, on, the, organism, s, phenotype, silent, mutations, some, mutations, do, not, change, the, amino, acid, sequence, because, multiple, codons, encode, the, same, amino, acid, synonymous, mutations, other, mutations, can, be, neutral, if, they, lead, to, amino, acid, sequence, changes, but, the, protein, still, functions, similarly, with, the, new, amino, acid, e, g, conservative, mutations, many, mutations, however, are, deleterious, or, even, lethal, and, are, removed, from, populations, by, natural, selection, genetic, disorders, are, the, result, of, deleterious, mutations, and, can, be, due, to, spontaneous, mutation, in, the, affected, individual, or, can, be, inherited, finally, a, small, fraction, of, mutations, are, beneficial, improving, the, organism, s, fitness, and, are, extremely, important, for, evolution, since, their, directional, selection, leads, to, adaptive, evolution, 7, 6, the, relationship, between, genes, can, be, measured, by, comparing, the, sequences, of, their, dna, if, the, level, of, similarity, exceeds, a, minimum, value, one, can, conclude, that, the, genes, descend, from, a, common, ancestor, they, are, homologous, genes, that, are, related, by, direct, descent, from, a, common, ancestor, are, orthologous, genes, they, are, usually, found, at, the, same, locus, in, different, species, genes, that, are, related, as, a, result, of, a, gene, duplication, event, are, parologous, genes, it, is, often, assumed, that, the, functions, of, orthologous, genes, are, more, similar, than, those, of, paralogous, genes, although, the, difference, is, minimal, the, most, common, source, of, new, genes, in, eukaryotic, lineages, is, gene, duplication, which, creates, copy, number, variation, of, an, existing, gene, in, the, genome, the, resulting, genes, paralogs, may, then, diverge, in, sequence, and, in, function, sets, of, genes, formed, in, this, way, compose, a, gene, family, gene, duplications, and, losses, within, a, family, are, common, and, represent, a, major, source, of, evolutionary, biodiversity, sometimes, gene, duplication, may, result, in, a, nonfunctional, copy, of, a, gene, or, a, functional, copy, may, be, subject, to, mutations, that, result, in, loss, of, function, such, nonfunctional, genes, are, called, pseudogenes, 7, 6, orphan, genes, whose, sequence, shows, no, similarity, to, existing, genes, are, less, common, than, gene, duplicates, the, human, genome, contains, an, estimate, 18, to, 60, genes, with, no, identifiable, homologs, outside, humans, orphan, genes, arise, primarily, from, either, de, novo, emergence, from, previously, non, coding, sequence, or, gene, duplication, followed, by, such, rapid, sequence, change, that, the, original, relationship, becomes, undetectable, de, novo, genes, are, typically, shorter, and, simpler, in, structure, than, most, eukaryotic, genes, with, few, if, any, introns, over, long, evolutionary, time, periods, de, novo, gene, birth, may, be, responsible, for, a, significant, fraction, of, taxonomically, restricted, gene, families, horizontal, gene, transfer, refers, to, the, transfer, of, genetic, material, through, a, mechanism, other, than, reproduction, this, mechanism, is, a, common, source, of, new, genes, in, prokaryotes, sometimes, thought, to, contribute, more, to, genetic, variation, than, gene, duplication, it, is, a, common, means, of, spreading, antibiotic, resistance, virulence, and, adaptive, metabolic, functions, although, horizontal, gene, transfer, is, rare, in, eukaryotes, likely, examples, have, been, identified, of, protist, and, alga, genomes, containing, genes, of, bacterial, origin, the, genome, is, the, total, genetic, material, of, an, organism, and, includes, both, the, genes, and, non, coding, sequences, eukaryotic, genes, can, be, annotated, using, finder, the, genome, size, and, the, number, of, genes, it, encodes, varies, widely, between, organisms, the, smallest, genomes, occur, in, viruses, and, viroids, which, act, as, a, single, non, coding, rna, gene, conversely, plants, can, have, extremely, large, genomes, with, rice, containing, 46, 000, protein, coding, genes, the, total, number, of, protein, coding, genes, the, earth, s, proteome, is, estimated, to, be, 5, million, sequences, although, the, number, of, base, pairs, of, dna, in, the, human, genome, has, been, known, since, the, 1950s, the, estimated, number, of, genes, has, changed, over, time, as, definitions, of, genes, and, methods, of, detecting, them, have, been, refined, initial, theoretical, predictions, of, the, number, of, human, genes, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, were, based, on, mutation, load, estimates, and, the, numbers, of, mrnas, and, these, estimates, tended, to, be, about, 30, 000, protein, coding, genes, during, the, 1990s, there, were, guesstimates, of, up, to, 100, 000, genes, and, early, data, on, detection, of, mrnas, expressed, sequence, tags, suggested, more, than, the, traditional, value, of, 30, 000, genes, that, had, been, reported, in, the, textbooks, during, the, 1980s, the, initial, draft, sequences, of, the, human, genome, confirmed, the, earlier, predictions, of, about, 30, 000, protein, coding, genes, however, that, estimate, has, fallen, to, about, 19, 000, with, the, ongoing, gencode, annotation, project, the, number, of, noncoding, genes, is, not, known, with, certainty, but, the, latest, estimates, from, ensembl, suggest, 26, 000, noncoding, genes, essential, genes, are, the, set, of, genes, thought, to, be, critical, for, an, organism, s, survival, this, definition, assumes, the, abundant, availability, of, all, relevant, nutrients, and, the, absence, of, environmental, stress, only, a, small, portion, of, an, organism, s, genes, are, essential, in, bacteria, an, estimated, 250, 400, genes, are, essential, for, escherichia, coli, and, bacillus, subtilis, which, is, less, than, 10, of, their, genes, half, of, these, genes, are, orthologs, in, both, organisms, and, are, largely, involved, in, protein, synthesis, in, the, budding, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, the, number, of, essential, genes, is, slightly, higher, at, 1000, genes, 20, of, their, genes, although, the, number, is, more, difficult, to, measure, in, higher, eukaryotes, mice, and, humans, are, estimated, to, have, around, 2000, essential, genes, 10, of, their, genes, the, synthetic, organism, syn, 3, has, a, minimal, genome, of, 473, essential, genes, and, quasi, essential, genes, necessary, for, fast, growth, although, 149, have, unknown, function, essential, genes, include, housekeeping, genes, critical, for, basic, cell, functions, as, well, as, genes, that, are, expressed, at, different, times, in, the, organisms, development, or, life, cycle, housekeeping, genes, are, used, as, experimental, controls, when, analysing, gene, expression, since, they, are, constitutively, expressed, at, a, relatively, constant, level, gene, nomenclature, has, been, established, by, the, hugo, gene, nomenclature, committee, hgnc, a, committee, of, the, human, genome, organisation, for, each, known, human, gene, in, the, form, of, an, approved, gene, name, and, symbol, short, form, abbreviation, which, can, be, accessed, through, a, database, maintained, by, hgnc, symbols, are, chosen, to, be, unique, and, each, gene, has, only, one, symbol, although, approved, symbols, sometimes, change, symbols, are, preferably, kept, consistent, with, other, members, of, a, gene, family, and, with, homologs, in, other, species, particularly, the, mouse, due, to, its, role, as, a, common, model, organism, genetic, engineering, is, the, modification, of, an, organism, s, genome, through, biotechnology, since, the, 1970s, a, variety, of, techniques, have, been, developed, to, specifically, add, remove, and, edit, genes, in, an, organism, recently, developed, genome, engineering, techniques, use, engineered, nuclease, enzymes, to, create, targeted, dna, repair, in, a, chromosome, to, either, disrupt, or, edit, a, gene, when, the, break, is, repaired, the, related, term, synthetic, biology, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, extensive, genetic, engineering, of, an, organism, genetic, engineering, is, now, a, routine, research, tool, with, model, organisms, for, example, genes, are, easily, added, to, bacteria, and, lineages, of, knockout, mice, with, a, specific, gene, s, function, disrupted, are, used, to, investigate, that, gene, s, function, many, organisms, have, been, genetically, modified, for, applications, in, agriculture, industrial, biotechnology, and, medicine, for, multicellular, organisms, typically, the, embryo, is, engineered, which, grows, into, the, adult, genetically, modified, organism, however, the, genomes, of, cells, in, an, adult, organism, can, be, edited, using, gene, therapy, techniques, to, treat, genetic, diseases
