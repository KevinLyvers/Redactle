chemical, biology, is, a, scientific, discipline, between, the, fields, of, chemistry, and, biology, the, discipline, involves, the, application, of, chemical, techniques, analysis, and, often, small, molecules, produced, through, synthetic, chemistry, to, the, study, and, manipulation, of, biological, systems, although, often, confused, with, biochemistry, which, studies, the, chemistry, of, biomolecules, and, regulation, of, biochemical, pathways, within, and, between, cells, chemical, biology, remains, distinct, by, focusing, on, the, application, of, chemical, tools, to, address, biological, questions, although, considered, a, relatively, new, scientific, field, the, term, chemical, biology, has, been, in, use, since, the, early, 20th, century, and, has, roots, in, scientific, discovery, from, the, early, 19th, century, the, term, chemical, biology, can, be, traced, back, to, an, early, appearance, in, a, book, published, by, alonzo, e, taylor, in, 1907, titled, on, fermentation, and, was, subsequently, used, in, john, b, leathes, 1930, article, titled, the, harveian, oration, on, the, birth, of, chemical, biology, however, it, is, unclear, when, the, term, was, first, used, friedrich, w, hler, s, 1828, synthesis, of, urea, is, an, early, example, of, the, application, of, synthetic, chemistry, to, advance, biology, it, showed, that, biological, compounds, could, be, synthesized, with, inorganic, starting, materials, and, weakened, the, previous, notion, of, vitalism, or, that, a, living, source, was, required, to, produce, organic, compounds, w, hler, s, work, is, often, considered, to, be, instrumental, in, the, development, of, organic, chemistry, and, natural, product, synthesis, both, of, which, play, a, large, part, in, modern, chemical, biology, friedrich, miescher, s, work, during, the, late, 19th, century, investigating, the, cellular, contents, of, human, leukocytes, led, to, the, discovery, of, nuclein, which, would, later, be, renamed, dna, after, isolating, the, nuclein, from, the, nucleus, of, leukocytes, through, protease, digestion, miescher, used, chemical, techniques, such, as, elemental, analysis, and, solubility, tests, to, determine, the, composition, of, nuclein, this, work, would, lay, the, foundations, for, watson, and, crick, s, discovery, of, the, double, helix, structure, of, dna, the, rising, interest, in, chemical, biology, has, led, to, the, setting, up, of, several, journals, dedicated, to, the, field, nature, chemical, biology, created, in, 2005, and, acs, chemical, biology, created, in, 2006, are, two, of, the, most, well, known, journals, in, this, field, with, impact, factors, of, 14, 8, and, 4, 0, respectively, fredrick, sanger, thomas, a, steitz, ada, e, yonath, brian, k, kobilka, george, p, smith, gregory, p, winter, jennifer, a, doudna, morten, meldal, glycobiology, is, the, study, of, the, structure, and, function, of, carbohydrates, while, dna, rna, and, proteins, are, encoded, at, the, genetic, level, carbohydrates, are, not, encoded, directly, from, the, genome, and, thus, require, different, tools, for, their, study, by, applying, chemical, principles, to, glycobiology, novel, methods, for, analyzing, and, synthesizing, carbohydrates, can, be, developed, for, example, cells, can, be, supplied, with, synthetic, variants, of, natural, sugars, to, probe, their, function, carolyn, bertozzi, s, research, group, has, developed, methods, for, site, specifically, reacting, molecules, at, the, surface, of, cells, via, synthetic, sugars, combinatorial, chemistry, involves, simultaneously, synthesizing, a, large, number, of, related, compounds, for, high, throughput, analysis, chemical, biologists, are, able, to, use, principles, from, combinatorial, chemistry, in, synthesizing, active, drug, compounds, and, maximizing, screening, efficiency, similarly, these, principles, can, be, used, in, areas, of, agriculture, and, food, research, specifically, in, the, syntheses, of, unnatural, products, and, in, generating, novel, enzyme, inhibitors, chemical, synthesis, of, proteins, is, a, valuable, tool, in, chemical, biology, as, it, allows, for, the, introduction, of, non, natural, amino, acids, as, well, as, residue, specific, incorporation, of, posttranslational, modifications, such, as, phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and, even, ubiquitination, these, properties, are, valuable, for, chemical, biologists, as, non, natural, amino, acids, can, be, used, to, probe, and, alter, the, functionality, of, proteins, while, post, translational, modifications, are, widely, known, to, regulate, the, structure, and, activity, of, proteins, although, strictly, biological, techniques, have, been, developed, to, achieve, these, ends, the, chemical, synthesis, of, peptides, often, has, a, lower, technical, and, practical, barrier, to, obtaining, small, amounts, of, the, desired, protein, to, make, protein, sized, polypeptide, chains, with, the, small, peptide, fragments, made, by, synthesis, chemical, biologists, can, use, the, process, of, native, chemical, ligation, native, chemical, ligation, involves, the, coupling, of, a, c, terminal, thioester, and, an, n, terminal, cysteine, residue, ultimately, resulting, in, formation, of, a, native, amide, bond, other, strategies, that, have, been, used, for, the, ligation, of, peptide, fragments, using, the, acyl, transfer, chemistry, first, introduced, with, native, chemical, ligation, include, expressed, protein, ligation, sulfurization, desulfurization, techniques, and, use, of, removable, thiol, auxiliaries, chemical, biologists, work, to, improve, proteomics, through, the, development, of, enrichment, strategies, chemical, affinity, tags, and, new, probes, samples, for, proteomics, often, contain, many, peptide, sequences, and, the, sequence, of, interest, may, be, highly, represented, or, of, low, abundance, which, creates, a, barrier, for, their, detection, chemical, biology, methods, can, reduce, sample, complexity, by, selective, enrichment, using, affinity, chromatography, this, involves, targeting, a, peptide, with, a, distinguishing, feature, like, a, biotin, label, or, a, post, translational, modification, methods, have, been, developed, that, include, the, use, of, antibodies, lectins, to, capture, glycoproteins, and, immobilized, metal, ions, to, capture, phosphorylated, peptides, and, enzyme, substrates, to, capture, select, enzymes, to, investigate, enzymatic, activity, as, opposed, to, total, protein, activity, based, reagents, have, been, developed, to, label, the, enzymatically, active, form, of, proteins, see, activity, based, proteomics, for, example, serine, hydrolase, and, cysteine, protease, inhibitors, have, been, converted, to, suicide, inhibitors, this, strategy, enhances, the, ability, to, selectively, analyze, low, abundance, constituents, through, direct, targeting, enzyme, activity, can, also, be, monitored, through, converted, substrate, identification, of, enzyme, substrates, is, a, problem, of, significant, difficulty, in, proteomics, and, is, vital, to, the, understanding, of, signal, transduction, pathways, in, cells, a, method, that, has, been, developed, uses, analog, sensitive, kinases, to, label, substrates, using, an, unnatural, atp, analog, facilitating, visualization, and, identification, through, a, unique, handle, many, research, programs, are, also, focused, on, employing, natural, biomolecules, to, perform, biological, tasks, or, to, support, a, new, chemical, method, in, this, regard, chemical, biology, researchers, have, shown, that, dna, can, serve, as, a, template, for, synthetic, chemistry, self, assembling, proteins, can, serve, as, a, structural, scaffold, for, new, materials, and, rna, can, be, evolved, in, vitro, to, produce, new, catalytic, function, additionally, heterobifunctional, two, sided, synthetic, small, molecules, such, as, dimerizers, or, protacs, bring, two, proteins, together, inside, cells, which, can, synthetically, induce, important, new, biological, functions, such, as, targeted, protein, degradation, a, primary, goal, of, protein, engineering, is, the, design, of, novel, peptides, or, proteins, with, a, desired, structure, and, chemical, activity, because, our, knowledge, of, the, relationship, between, primary, sequence, structure, and, function, of, proteins, is, limited, rational, design, of, new, proteins, with, engineered, activities, is, extremely, challenging, in, directed, evolution, repeated, cycles, of, genetic, diversification, followed, by, a, screening, or, selection, process, can, be, used, to, mimic, natural, selection, in, the, laboratory, to, design, new, proteins, with, a, desired, activity, several, methods, exist, for, creating, large, libraries, of, sequence, variants, among, the, most, widely, used, are, subjecting, dna, to, uv, radiation, or, chemical, mutagens, error, prone, pcr, degenerate, codons, or, recombination, once, a, large, library, of, variants, is, created, selection, or, screening, techniques, are, used, to, find, mutants, with, a, desired, attribute, common, selection, screening, techniques, include, facs, mrna, display, phage, display, and, in, vitro, compartmentalization, once, useful, variants, are, found, their, dna, sequence, is, amplified, and, subjected, to, further, rounds, of, diversification, and, selection, the, development, of, directed, evolution, methods, was, honored, in, 2018, with, the, awarding, of, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, to, frances, arnold, for, evolution, of, enzymes, and, george, smith, and, gregory, winter, for, phage, display, successful, labeling, of, a, molecule, of, interest, requires, specific, functionalization, of, that, molecule, to, react, chemospecifically, with, an, optical, probe, for, a, labeling, experiment, to, be, considered, robust, that, functionalization, must, minimally, perturb, the, system, unfortunately, these, requirements, are, often, hard, to, meet, many, of, the, reactions, normally, available, to, organic, chemists, in, the, laboratory, are, unavailable, in, living, systems, water, and, redox, sensitive, reactions, would, not, proceed, reagents, prone, to, nucleophilic, attack, would, offer, no, chemospecificity, and, any, reactions, with, large, kinetic, barriers, would, not, find, enough, energy, in, the, relatively, low, heat, environment, of, a, living, cell, thus, chemists, have, recently, developed, a, panel, of, bioorthogonal, chemistry, that, proceed, chemospecifically, despite, the, milieu, of, distracting, reactive, materials, in, vivo, the, coupling, of, a, probe, to, a, molecule, of, interest, must, occur, within, a, reasonably, short, time, frame, therefore, the, kinetics, of, the, coupling, reaction, should, be, highly, favorable, click, chemistry, is, well, suited, to, fill, this, niche, since, click, reactions, are, rapid, spontaneous, selective, and, high, yielding, unfortunately, the, most, famous, click, reaction, a, cycloaddition, between, an, azide, and, an, acyclic, alkyne, is, copper, catalyzed, posing, a, serious, problem, for, use, in, vivo, due, to, copper, s, toxicity, to, bypass, the, necessity, for, a, catalyst, carolyn, r, bertozzi, s, lab, introduced, inherent, strain, into, the, alkyne, species, by, using, a, cyclic, alkyne, in, particular, cyclooctyne, reacts, with, azido, molecules, with, distinctive, vigor, the, advances, in, modern, sequencing, technologies, in, the, late, 1990s, allowed, scientists, to, investigate, dna, of, communities, of, organisms, in, their, natural, environments, edna, without, culturing, individual, species, in, the, lab, this, metagenomic, approach, enabled, scientists, to, study, a, wide, selection, of, organisms, that, were, previously, not, characterized, due, in, part, to, an, incompetent, growth, condition, sources, of, edna, include, soils, ocean, subsurface, hot, springs, hydrothermal, vents, polar, ice, caps, hypersaline, habitats, and, extreme, ph, environments, of, the, many, applications, of, metagenomics, researchers, such, as, jo, handelsman, jon, clardy, and, robert, m, goodman, explored, metagenomic, approaches, toward, the, discovery, of, biologically, active, molecules, such, as, antibiotics, functional, or, homology, screening, strategies, have, been, used, to, identify, genes, that, produce, small, bioactive, molecules, functional, metagenomic, studies, are, designed, to, search, for, specific, phenotypes, that, are, associated, with, molecules, with, specific, characteristics, homology, metagenomic, studies, on, the, other, hand, are, designed, to, examine, genes, to, identify, conserved, sequences, that, are, previously, associated, with, the, expression, of, biologically, active, molecules, functional, metagenomic, studies, enable, the, discovery, of, novel, genes, that, encode, biologically, active, molecules, these, assays, include, top, agar, overlay, assays, where, antibiotics, generate, zones, of, growth, inhibition, against, test, microbes, and, ph, assays, that, can, screen, for, ph, change, due, to, newly, synthesized, molecules, using, ph, indicator, on, an, agar, plate, substrate, induced, gene, expression, screening, sigex, a, method, to, screen, for, the, expression, of, genes, that, are, induced, by, chemical, compounds, has, also, been, used, to, search, for, genes, with, specific, functions, homology, based, metagenomic, studies, have, led, to, a, fast, discovery, of, genes, that, have, homologous, sequences, as, the, previously, known, genes, that, are, responsible, for, the, biosynthesis, of, biologically, active, molecules, as, soon, as, the, genes, are, sequenced, scientists, can, compare, thousands, of, bacterial, genomes, simultaneously, the, advantage, over, functional, metagenomic, assays, is, that, homology, metagenomic, studies, do, not, require, a, host, organism, system, to, express, the, metagenomes, thus, this, method, can, potentially, save, the, time, spent, on, analyzing, nonfunctional, genomes, these, also, led, to, the, discovery, of, several, novel, proteins, and, small, molecules, in, addition, an, in, silico, examination, from, the, global, ocean, metagenomic, survey, found, 20, new, lantibiotic, cyclases, posttranslational, modification, of, proteins, with, phosphate, groups, by, kinases, is, a, key, regulatory, step, throughout, all, biological, systems, phosphorylation, events, either, phosphorylation, by, protein, kinases, or, dephosphorylation, by, phosphatases, result, in, protein, activation, or, deactivation, these, events, have, an, impact, on, the, regulation, of, physiological, pathways, which, makes, the, ability, to, dissect, and, study, these, pathways, integral, to, understanding, the, details, of, cellular, processes, there, exist, a, number, of, challenges, namely, the, sheer, size, of, the, phosphoproteome, the, fleeting, nature, of, phosphorylation, events, and, related, physical, limitations, of, classical, biological, and, biochemical, techniques, that, have, limited, the, advancement, of, knowledge, in, this, area, through, the, use, of, small, molecule, modulators, of, protein, kinases, chemical, biologists, have, gained, a, better, understanding, of, the, effects, of, protein, phosphorylation, for, example, nonselective, and, selective, kinase, inhibitors, such, as, a, class, of, pyridinylimidazole, compounds, are, potent, inhibitors, useful, in, the, dissection, of, map, kinase, signaling, pathways, these, pyridinylimidazole, compounds, function, by, targeting, the, atp, binding, pocket, although, this, approach, as, well, as, related, approaches, with, slight, modifications, has, proven, effective, in, a, number, of, cases, these, compounds, lack, adequate, specificity, for, more, general, applications, another, class, of, compounds, mechanism, based, inhibitors, combines, knowledge, of, the, kinase, enzymology, with, previously, utilized, inhibition, motifs, for, example, a, bisubstrate, analog, inhibits, kinase, action, by, binding, both, the, conserved, atp, binding, pocket, and, a, protein, peptide, recognition, site, on, the, specific, kinase, research, groups, also, utilized, atp, analogs, as, chemical, probes, to, study, kinases, and, identify, their, substrates, the, development, of, novel, chemical, means, of, incorporating, phosphomimetic, amino, acids, into, proteins, has, provided, important, insight, into, the, effects, of, phosphorylation, events, phosphorylation, events, have, typically, been, studied, by, mutating, an, identified, phosphorylation, site, serine, threonine, or, tyrosine, to, an, amino, acid, such, as, alanine, that, cannot, be, phosphorylated, however, these, techniques, come, with, limitations, and, chemical, biologists, have, developed, improved, ways, of, investigating, protein, phosphorylation, by, installing, phospho, serine, phospho, threonine, or, analogous, phosphonate, mimics, into, native, proteins, researchers, are, able, to, perform, in, vivo, studies, to, investigate, the, effects, of, phosphorylation, by, extending, the, amount, of, time, a, phosphorylation, event, occurs, while, minimizing, the, often, unfavorable, effects, of, mutations, expressed, protein, ligation, has, proven, to, be, successful, techniques, for, synthetically, producing, proteins, that, contain, phosphomimetic, molecules, at, either, terminus, in, addition, researchers, have, used, unnatural, amino, acid, mutagenesis, at, targeted, sites, within, a, peptide, sequence, advances, in, chemical, biology, have, also, improved, upon, classical, techniques, of, imaging, kinase, action, for, example, the, development, of, peptide, biosensors, peptides, containing, incorporated, fluorophores, improved, temporal, resolution, of, in, vitro, binding, assays, one, of, the, most, useful, techniques, to, study, kinase, action, is, fluorescence, resonance, energy, transfer, fret, to, utilize, fret, for, phosphorylation, studies, fluorescent, proteins, are, coupled, to, both, a, phosphoamino, acid, binding, domain, and, a, peptide, that, can, be, phosphorylated, upon, phosphorylation, or, dephosphorylation, of, a, substrate, peptide, a, conformational, change, occurs, that, results, in, a, change, in, fluorescence, fret, has, also, been, used, in, tandem, with, fluorescence, lifetime, imaging, microscopy, flim, or, fluorescently, conjugated, antibodies, and, flow, cytometry, to, provide, quantitative, results, with, excellent, temporal, and, spatial, resolution, chemical, biologists, often, study, the, functions, of, biological, macromolecules, using, fluorescence, techniques, the, advantage, of, fluorescence, versus, other, techniques, resides, in, its, high, sensitivity, non, invasiveness, safe, detection, and, ability, to, modulate, the, fluorescence, signal, in, recent, years, the, discovery, of, green, fluorescent, protein, gfp, by, roger, y, tsien, and, others, hybrid, systems, and, quantum, dots, have, enabled, assessing, protein, location, and, function, more, precisely, three, main, types, of, fluorophores, are, used, small, organic, dyes, green, fluorescent, proteins, and, quantum, dots, small, organic, dyes, usually, are, less, than, 1, kda, and, have, been, modified, to, increase, photostability, and, brightness, and, reduce, self, quenching, quantum, dots, have, very, sharp, wavelengths, high, molar, absorptivity, and, quantum, yield, both, organic, dyes, and, quantum, dyes, do, not, have, the, ability, to, recognize, the, protein, of, interest, without, the, aid, of, antibodies, hence, they, must, use, immunolabeling, fluorescent, proteins, are, genetically, encoded, and, can, be, fused, to, your, protein, of, interest, another, genetic, tagging, technique, is, the, tetracysteine, biarsenical, system, which, requires, modification, of, the, targeted, sequence, that, includes, four, cysteines, which, binds, membrane, permeable, biarsenical, molecules, the, green, and, the, red, dyes, flash, and, reash, with, picomolar, affinity, both, fluorescent, proteins, and, biarsenical, tetracysteine, can, be, expressed, in, live, cells, but, present, major, limitations, in, ectopic, expression, and, might, cause, a, loss, of, function, fluorescent, techniques, have, been, used, to, assess, a, number, of, protein, dynamics, including, protein, tracking, conformational, changes, protein, protein, interactions, protein, synthesis, and, turnover, and, enzyme, activity, among, others, three, general, approaches, for, measuring, protein, net, redistribution, and, diffusion, are, single, particle, tracking, correlation, spectroscopy, and, photomarking, methods, in, single, particle, tracking, the, individual, molecule, must, be, both, bright, and, sparse, enough, to, be, tracked, from, one, video, to, the, other, correlation, spectroscopy, analyzes, the, intensity, fluctuations, resulting, from, migration, of, fluorescent, objects, into, and, out, of, a, small, volume, at, the, focus, of, a, laser, in, photomarking, a, fluorescent, protein, can, be, dequenched, in, a, subcellular, area, with, the, use, of, intense, local, illumination, and, the, fate, of, the, marked, molecule, can, be, imaged, directly, michalet, and, coworkers, used, quantum, dots, for, single, particle, tracking, using, biotin, quantum, dots, in, hela, cells, one, of, the, best, ways, to, detect, conformational, changes, in, proteins, is, to, label, the, protein, of, interest, with, two, fluorophores, within, close, proximity, fret, will, respond, to, internal, conformational, changes, result, from, reorientation, of, one, fluorophore, with, respect, to, the, other, one, can, also, use, fluorescence, to, visualize, enzyme, activity, typically, by, using, a, quenched, activity, based, proteomics, qabp, covalent, binding, of, a, qabp, to, the, active, site, of, the, targeted, enzyme, will, provide, direct, evidence, concerning, if, the, enzyme, is, responsible, for, the, signal, upon, release, of, the, quencher, and, regain, of, fluorescence, despite, an, increase, in, biological, research, within, chemistry, departments, attempts, at, integrating, chemical, biology, into, undergraduate, curricula, are, lacking, for, example, although, the, american, chemical, society, acs, requires, for, foundational, courses, in, a, chemistry, bachelor, s, degree, to, include, biochemistry, no, other, biology, related, chemistry, course, is, required, although, a, chemical, biology, course, is, often, not, required, for, an, undergraduate, degree, in, chemistry, many, universities, now, provide, introductory, chemical, biology, courses, for, their, undergraduate, students, the, university, of, british, columbia, for, example, offers, a, fourth, year, course, in, synthetic, chemical, biology
