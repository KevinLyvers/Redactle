the, dinoflagellates, from, ancient, greek, d, nos, whirling, and, latin, flagellum, whip, scourge, are, a, monophyletic, group, of, single, celled, eukaryotes, constituting, the, phylum, dinoflagellata, and, are, usually, considered, protists, dinoflagellates, are, mostly, marine, plankton, but, they, are, also, common, in, freshwater, habitats, their, populations, vary, with, sea, surface, temperature, salinity, and, depth, many, dinoflagellates, are, photosynthetic, but, a, large, fraction, of, these, are, in, fact, mixotrophic, combining, photosynthesis, with, ingestion, of, prey, phagotrophy, and, myzocytosis, in, terms, of, number, of, species, dinoflagellates, are, one, of, the, largest, groups, of, marine, eukaryotes, although, substantially, smaller, than, diatoms, some, species, are, endosymbionts, of, marine, animals, and, play, an, important, part, in, the, biology, of, coral, reefs, other, dinoflagellates, are, unpigmented, predators, on, other, protozoa, and, a, few, forms, are, parasitic, for, example, oodinium, and, pfiesteria, some, dinoflagellates, produce, resting, stages, called, dinoflagellate, cysts, or, dinocysts, as, part, of, their, lifecycles, this, occurs, in, 84, of, the, 350, described, freshwater, species, and, a, little, more, than, 10, of, the, known, marine, species, dinoflagellates, are, alveolates, possessing, two, flagella, the, ancestral, condition, of, bikonts, about, 1, 555, species, of, free, living, marine, dinoflagellates, are, currently, described, another, estimate, suggests, about, 2, 000, living, species, of, which, more, than, 1, 700, are, marine, free, living, as, well, as, benthic, and, about, 220, are, from, fresh, water, the, latest, estimates, suggest, a, total, of, 2, 294, living, dinoflagellate, species, which, includes, marine, freshwater, and, parasitic, dinoflagellates, a, rapid, accumulation, of, certain, dinoflagellates, can, result, in, a, visible, coloration, of, the, water, colloquially, known, as, red, tide, a, harmful, algal, bloom, which, can, cause, shellfish, poisoning, if, humans, eat, contaminated, shellfish, some, dinoflagellates, also, exhibit, bioluminescence, primarily, emitting, blue, green, light, which, may, be, visible, in, oceanic, areas, under, certain, conditions, the, term, dinoflagellate, is, a, combination, of, the, greek, dinos, and, the, latin, flagellum, dinos, means, whirling, and, signifies, the, distinctive, way, in, which, dinoflagellates, were, observed, to, swim, flagellum, means, whip, and, this, refers, to, their, flagella, in, 1753, the, first, modern, dinoflagellates, were, described, by, henry, baker, as, animalcules, which, cause, the, sparkling, light, in, sea, water, and, named, by, otto, friedrich, m, ller, in, 1773, the, term, derives, from, the, greek, word, d, nos, meaning, whirling, and, latin, flagellum, a, diminutive, term, for, a, whip, or, scourge, in, the, 1830s, the, german, microscopist, christian, gottfried, ehrenberg, examined, many, water, and, plankton, samples, and, proposed, several, dinoflagellate, genera, that, are, still, used, today, including, peridinium, prorocentrum, and, dinophysis, these, same, dinoflagellates, were, first, defined, by, otto, b, tschli, in, 1885, as, the, flagellate, order, dinoflagellida, botanists, treated, them, as, a, division, of, algae, named, pyrrophyta, or, pyrrhophyta, fire, algae, greek, pyrr, h, os, fire, after, the, bioluminescent, forms, or, dinophyta, at, various, times, the, cryptomonads, ebriids, and, ellobiopsids, have, been, included, here, but, only, the, last, are, now, considered, close, relatives, dinoflagellates, have, a, known, ability, to, transform, from, noncyst, to, cyst, forming, strategies, which, makes, recreating, their, evolutionary, history, extremely, difficult, dinoflagellates, are, unicellular, and, possess, two, dissimilar, flagella, arising, from, the, ventral, cell, side, dinokont, flagellation, they, have, a, ribbon, like, transverse, flagellum, with, multiple, waves, that, beats, to, the, cell, s, left, and, a, more, conventional, one, the, longitudinal, flagellum, that, beats, posteriorly, the, transverse, flagellum, is, a, wavy, ribbon, in, which, only, the, outer, edge, undulates, from, base, to, tip, due, to, the, action, of, the, axoneme, which, runs, along, it, the, axonemal, edge, has, simple, hairs, that, can, be, of, varying, lengths, the, flagellar, movement, produces, forward, propulsion, and, also, a, turning, force, the, longitudinal, flagellum, is, relatively, conventional, in, appearance, with, few, or, no, hairs, it, beats, with, only, one, or, two, periods, to, its, wave, the, flagella, lie, in, surface, grooves, the, transverse, one, in, the, cingulum, and, the, longitudinal, one, in, the, sulcus, although, its, distal, portion, projects, freely, behind, the, cell, in, dinoflagellate, species, with, desmokont, flagellation, e, g, prorocentrum, the, two, flagella, are, differentiated, as, in, dinokonts, but, they, are, not, associated, with, grooves, dinoflagellates, have, a, complex, cell, covering, called, an, amphiesma, or, cortex, composed, of, a, series, of, membranes, flattened, vesicles, called, alveoli, amphiesmal, vesicles, and, related, structures, in, thecate, armoured, dinoflagellates, these, support, overlapping, cellulose, plates, to, create, a, sort, of, armor, called, the, theca, or, lorica, as, opposed, to, athecate, nude, dinoflagellates, these, occur, in, various, shapes, and, arrangements, depending, on, the, species, and, sometimes, on, the, stage, of, the, dinoflagellate, conventionally, the, term, tabulation, has, been, used, to, refer, to, this, arrangement, of, thecal, plates, the, plate, configuration, can, be, denoted, with, the, plate, formula, or, tabulation, formula, fibrous, extrusomes, are, also, found, in, many, forms, a, transverse, groove, the, so, called, cingulum, or, cigulum, runs, around, the, cell, thus, dividing, it, into, an, anterior, episoma, and, posterior, hyposoma, if, and, only, if, a, theca, is, present, the, parts, are, called, epitheca, and, hypotheca, respectively, posteriorly, starting, from, the, transverse, groove, there, is, a, longitudinal, furrow, called, the, sulcus, the, transverse, flagellum, strikes, in, the, cingulum, the, longitudinal, flagellum, in, the, sulcus, together, with, various, other, structural, and, genetic, details, this, organization, indicates, a, close, relationship, between, the, dinoflagellates, the, apicomplexa, and, ciliates, collectively, referred, to, as, the, alveolates, dinoflagellate, tabulations, can, be, grouped, into, six, tabulation, types, gymnodinoid, suessoid, gonyaulacoid, peridinioid, nannoceratopsioid, dinophysioid, and, prorocentroid, the, chloroplasts, in, most, photosynthetic, dinoflagellates, are, bound, by, three, membranes, suggesting, they, were, probably, derived, from, some, ingested, algae, most, photosynthetic, species, contain, chlorophylls, a, and, c2, the, carotenoid, beta, carotene, and, a, group, of, xanthophylls, that, appears, to, be, unique, to, dinoflagellates, typically, peridinin, dinoxanthin, and, diadinoxanthin, these, pigments, give, many, dinoflagellates, their, typical, golden, brown, color, however, the, dinoflagellates, karenia, brevis, karenia, mikimotoi, and, karlodinium, micrum, have, acquired, other, pigments, through, endosymbiosis, including, fucoxanthin, this, suggests, their, chloroplasts, were, incorporated, by, several, endosymbiotic, events, involving, already, colored, or, secondarily, colorless, forms, the, discovery, of, plastids, in, the, apicomplexa, has, led, some, to, suggest, they, were, inherited, from, an, ancestor, common, to, the, two, groups, but, none, of, the, more, basal, lines, has, them, all, the, same, the, dinoflagellate, cell, consists, of, the, more, common, organelles, such, as, rough, and, smooth, endoplasmic, reticulum, golgi, apparatus, mitochondria, lipid, and, starch, grains, and, food, vacuoles, some, have, even, been, found, with, a, light, sensitive, organelle, the, eyespot, or, stigma, or, a, larger, nucleus, containing, a, prominent, nucleolus, the, dinoflagellate, erythropsidinium, has, the, smallest, known, eye, some, athecate, species, have, an, internal, skeleton, consisting, of, two, star, like, siliceous, elements, that, has, an, unknown, function, and, can, be, found, as, microfossils, tappan, gave, a, survey, of, dinoflagellates, with, internal, skeletons, this, included, the, first, detailed, description, of, the, pentasters, in, actiniscus, pentasterias, based, on, scanning, electron, microscopy, they, are, placed, within, the, order, gymnodiniales, suborder, actiniscineae, the, formation, of, thecal, plates, has, been, studied, in, detail, through, ultrastructural, studies, core, dinoflagellates, dinokaryotes, have, a, peculiar, form, of, nucleus, called, a, dinokaryon, in, which, the, chromosomes, are, attached, to, the, nuclear, membrane, these, carry, reduced, number, of, histones, in, place, of, histones, dinoflagellate, nuclei, contain, a, novel, dominant, family, of, nuclear, proteins, that, appear, to, be, of, viral, origin, thus, are, called, dinoflagellate, viral, nucleoproteins, dvnps, which, are, highly, basic, bind, dna, with, similar, affinity, to, histones, and, occur, in, multiple, posttranslationally, modified, forms, dinoflagellate, nuclei, remain, condensed, throughout, interphase, rather, than, just, during, mitosis, which, is, closed, and, involves, a, uniquely, extranuclear, mitotic, spindle, this, sort, of, nucleus, was, once, considered, to, be, an, intermediate, between, the, nucleoid, region, of, prokaryotes, and, the, true, nuclei, of, eukaryotes, so, were, termed, mesokaryotic, but, now, are, considered, derived, rather, than, primitive, traits, i, e, ancestors, of, dinoflagellates, had, typical, eukaryotic, nuclei, in, addition, to, dinokaryotes, dvnps, can, be, found, in, a, group, of, basal, dinoflagellates, known, as, marine, alveolates, malvs, that, branch, as, sister, to, dinokaryotes, syndiniales, dinoflagellates, are, protists, and, have, been, classified, using, both, the, international, code, of, botanical, nomenclature, icbn, now, renamed, as, icn, and, the, international, code, of, zoological, nomenclature, iczn, about, half, of, living, dinoflagellate, species, are, autotrophs, possessing, chloroplasts, and, half, are, nonphotosynthesising, heterotrophs, the, peridinin, dinoflagellates, named, after, their, peridinin, plastids, appear, to, be, ancestral, for, the, dinoflagellate, lineage, almost, half, of, all, known, species, have, chloroplasts, which, are, either, the, original, peridinin, plastids, or, new, plastids, acquired, from, other, lineages, of, unicellular, algae, through, endosymbiosis, the, remaining, species, have, lost, their, photosynthetic, abilities, and, have, adapted, to, a, heterotrophic, parasitic, or, kleptoplastic, lifestyle, most, but, not, all, dinoflagellates, have, a, dinokaryon, described, below, see, life, cycle, below, dinoflagellates, with, a, dinokaryon, are, classified, under, dinokaryota, while, dinoflagellates, without, a, dinokaryon, are, classified, under, syndiniales, although, classified, as, eukaryotes, the, dinoflagellate, nuclei, are, not, characteristically, eukaryotic, as, some, of, them, lack, histones, and, nucleosomes, and, maintain, continually, condensed, chromosomes, during, mitosis, the, dinoflagellate, nucleus, was, termed, mesokaryotic, by, dodge, 1966, due, to, its, possession, of, intermediate, characteristics, between, the, coiled, dna, areas, of, prokaryotic, bacteria, and, the, well, defined, eukaryotic, nucleus, this, group, however, does, contain, typically, eukaryotic, organelles, such, as, golgi, bodies, mitochondria, and, chloroplasts, jakob, schiller, 1931, 1937, provided, a, description, of, all, the, species, both, marine, and, freshwater, known, at, that, time, later, alain, sournia, 1973, 1978, 1982, 1990, 1993, listed, the, new, taxonomic, entries, published, after, schiller, 1931, 1937, sournia, 1986, gave, descriptions, and, illustrations, of, the, marine, genera, of, dinoflagellates, excluding, information, at, the, species, level, the, latest, index, is, written, by, g, mez, english, language, taxonomic, monographs, covering, large, numbers, of, species, are, published, for, the, gulf, of, mexico, the, indian, ocean, the, british, isles, the, mediterranean, and, the, north, sea, the, main, source, for, identification, of, freshwater, dinoflagellates, is, the, s, sswasser, flora, calcofluor, white, can, be, used, to, stain, thecal, plates, in, armoured, dinoflagellates, dinoflagellates, are, found, in, all, aquatic, environments, marine, brackish, and, fresh, water, including, in, snow, or, ice, they, are, also, common, in, benthic, environments, and, sea, ice, all, zooxanthellae, are, dinoflagellates, and, most, of, them, are, members, within, symbiodiniaceae, e, g, the, genus, symbiodinium, the, association, between, symbiodinium, and, reef, building, corals, is, widely, known, however, endosymbiontic, zooxanthellae, inhabit, a, great, number, of, other, invertebrates, and, protists, for, example, many, sea, anemones, jellyfish, nudibranchs, the, giant, clam, tridacna, and, several, species, of, radiolarians, and, foraminiferans, many, extant, dinoflagellates, are, parasites, here, defined, as, organisms, that, eat, their, prey, from, the, inside, i, e, endoparasites, or, that, remain, attached, to, their, prey, for, longer, periods, of, time, i, e, ectoparasites, they, can, parasitize, animal, or, protist, hosts, protoodinium, crepidoodinium, piscinoodinium, and, blastodinium, retain, their, plastids, while, feeding, on, their, zooplanktonic, or, fish, hosts, in, most, parasitic, dinoflagellates, the, infective, stage, resembles, a, typical, motile, dinoflagellate, cell, three, nutritional, strategies, are, seen, in, dinoflagellates, phototrophy, mixotrophy, and, heterotrophy, phototrophs, can, be, photoautotrophs, or, auxotrophs, mixotrophic, dinoflagellates, are, photosynthetically, active, but, are, also, heterotrophic, facultative, mixotrophs, in, which, autotrophy, or, heterotrophy, is, sufficient, for, nutrition, are, classified, as, amphitrophic, if, both, forms, are, required, the, organisms, are, mixotrophic, sensu, stricto, some, free, living, dinoflagellates, do, not, have, chloroplasts, but, host, a, phototrophic, endosymbiont, a, few, dinoflagellates, may, use, alien, chloroplasts, cleptochloroplasts, obtained, from, food, kleptoplasty, some, dinoflagellates, may, feed, on, other, organisms, as, predators, or, parasites, food, inclusions, contain, bacteria, bluegreen, algae, diatoms, ciliates, and, other, dinoflagellates, mechanisms, of, capture, and, ingestion, in, dinoflagellates, are, quite, diverse, several, dinoflagellates, both, thecate, e, g, ceratium, hirundinella, peridinium, globulus, and, nonthecate, e, g, oxyrrhis, marina, gymnodinium, sp, and, kofoidinium, spp, draw, prey, to, the, sulcal, region, of, the, cell, either, via, water, currents, set, up, by, the, flagella, or, via, pseudopodial, extensions, and, ingest, the, prey, through, the, sulcus, in, several, protoperidinium, spp, e, g, p, conicum, a, large, feeding, veil, a, pseudopod, called, the, pallium, is, extruded, to, capture, prey, which, is, subsequently, digested, extracellularly, pallium, feeding, oblea, zygabikodinium, and, diplopsalis, are, the, only, other, dinoflagellate, genera, known, to, use, this, particular, feeding, mechanism, katodinium, gymnodinium, fungiforme, commonly, found, as, a, contaminant, in, algal, or, ciliate, cultures, feeds, by, attaching, to, its, prey, and, ingesting, prey, cytoplasm, through, an, extensible, peduncle, two, related, species, polykrikos, kofoidii, and, neatodinium, shoots, out, a, harpoon, like, organelle, to, capture, prey, some, mixotrophic, dinoflagellates, are, able, to, produce, neurotoxins, that, have, anti, grazing, effects, on, larger, copepods, and, enhance, the, ability, of, the, dinoflagellate, to, prey, upon, larger, copepods, toxic, strains, of, k, veneficum, produce, karlotoxin, that, kills, predators, who, ingest, them, thus, reducing, predatory, populations, and, allowing, blooms, of, both, toxic, and, non, toxic, strains, of, k, veneficum, further, the, production, of, karlotoxin, enhances, the, predatory, ability, of, k, veneficum, by, immobilizing, its, larger, prey, k, arminger, are, more, inclined, to, prey, upon, copepods, by, releasing, a, potent, neurotoxin, that, immobilizes, its, prey, upon, contact, when, k, arminger, are, present, in, large, enough, quantities, they, are, able, to, cull, whole, populations, of, its, copepods, prey, the, feeding, mechanisms, of, the, oceanic, dinoflagellates, remain, unknown, although, pseudopodial, extensions, were, observed, in, podolampas, bipes, dinoflagellate, blooms, are, generally, unpredictable, short, with, low, species, diversity, and, with, little, species, succession, the, low, species, diversity, can, be, due, to, multiple, factors, one, way, a, lack, of, diversity, may, occur, in, a, bloom, is, through, a, reduction, in, predation, and, a, decreased, competition, the, first, may, be, achieved, by, having, predators, reject, the, dinoflagellate, by, for, example, decreasing, the, amount, of, food, it, can, eat, this, additionally, helps, prevent, a, future, increase, in, predation, pressure, by, causing, predators, that, reject, it, to, lack, the, energy, to, breed, a, species, can, then, inhibit, the, growth, of, its, competitors, thus, achieving, dominance, dinoflagellates, sometimes, bloom, in, concentrations, of, more, than, a, million, cells, per, millilitre, under, such, circumstances, they, can, produce, toxins, generally, called, dinotoxins, in, quantities, capable, of, killing, fish, and, accumulating, in, filter, feeders, such, as, shellfish, which, in, turn, may, be, passed, on, to, people, who, eat, them, this, phenomenon, is, called, a, red, tide, from, the, color, the, bloom, imparts, to, the, water, some, colorless, dinoflagellates, may, also, form, toxic, blooms, such, as, pfiesteria, some, dinoflagellate, blooms, are, not, dangerous, bluish, flickers, visible, in, ocean, water, at, night, often, come, from, blooms, of, bioluminescent, dinoflagellates, which, emit, short, flashes, of, light, when, disturbed, a, red, tide, occurs, because, dinoflagellates, are, able, to, reproduce, rapidly, and, copiously, as, a, result, of, the, abundant, nutrients, in, the, water, although, the, resulting, red, waves, are, an, interesting, visual, phenomenon, they, contain, toxins, that, not, only, affect, all, marine, life, in, the, ocean, but, the, people, who, consume, them, as, well, a, specific, carrier, is, shellfish, this, can, introduce, both, nonfatal, and, fatal, illnesses, one, such, poison, is, saxitoxin, a, powerful, paralytic, neurotoxin, human, inputs, of, phosphate, further, encourage, these, red, tides, so, strong, interest, exists, in, learning, more, about, dinoflagellates, from, both, medical, and, economic, perspectives, dinoflagellates, are, known, to, be, particularly, capable, of, scavenging, dissolved, organic, phosphorus, for, p, nutrient, several, has, species, have, been, found, to, be, highly, versatile, and, mechanistically, diversified, in, utilizing, different, types, of, dops, the, ecology, of, harmful, algal, blooms, is, extensively, studied, at, night, water, can, have, an, appearance, of, sparkling, light, due, to, the, bioluminescence, of, dinoflagellates, more, than, 18, genera, of, dinoflagellates, are, bioluminescent, and, the, majority, of, them, emit, a, blue, green, light, these, species, contain, scintillons, individual, cytoplasmic, bodies, about, 0, 5, m, in, diameter, distributed, mainly, in, the, cortical, region, of, the, cell, outpockets, of, the, main, cell, vacuole, they, contain, dinoflagellate, luciferase, the, main, enzyme, involved, in, dinoflagellate, bioluminescence, and, luciferin, a, chlorophyll, derived, tetrapyrrole, ring, that, acts, as, the, substrate, to, the, light, producing, reaction, the, luminescence, occurs, as, a, brief, 0, 1, sec, blue, flash, max, 476, nm, when, stimulated, usually, by, mechanical, disturbance, therefore, when, mechanically, stimulated, by, boat, swimming, or, waves, for, example, a, blue, sparkling, light, can, be, seen, emanating, from, the, sea, surface, dinoflagellate, bioluminescence, is, controlled, by, a, circadian, clock, and, only, occurs, at, night, luminescent, and, nonluminescent, strains, can, occur, in, the, same, species, the, number, of, scintillons, is, higher, during, night, than, during, day, and, breaks, down, during, the, end, of, the, night, at, the, time, of, maximal, bioluminescence, the, luciferin, luciferase, reaction, responsible, for, the, bioluminescence, is, ph, sensitive, when, the, ph, drops, luciferase, changes, its, shape, allowing, luciferin, more, specifically, tetrapyrrole, to, bind, dinoflagellates, can, use, bioluminescence, as, a, defense, mechanism, they, can, startle, their, predators, by, their, flashing, light, or, they, can, ward, off, potential, predators, by, an, indirect, effect, such, as, the, burglar, alarm, the, bioluminescence, attracts, attention, to, the, dinoflagellate, and, its, attacker, making, the, predator, more, vulnerable, to, predation, from, higher, trophic, levels, bioluminescent, dinoflagellate, ecosystem, bays, are, among, the, rarest, and, most, fragile, with, the, most, famous, ones, being, the, bioluminescent, bay, in, la, parguera, lajas, puerto, rico, mosquito, bay, in, vieques, puerto, rico, and, las, cabezas, de, san, juan, reserva, natural, fajardo, puerto, rico, also, a, bioluminescent, lagoon, is, near, montego, bay, jamaica, and, bioluminescent, harbors, surround, castine, maine, within, the, united, states, central, florida, is, home, to, the, indian, river, lagoon, which, is, abundant, with, dinoflagellates, in, the, summer, and, bioluminescent, ctenophore, in, the, winter, dinoflagellates, produce, characteristic, lipids, and, sterols, one, of, these, sterols, is, typical, of, dinoflagellates, and, is, called, dinosterol, dinoflagellate, theca, can, sink, rapidly, to, the, seafloor, in, marine, snow, dinoflagellates, have, a, haplontic, life, cycle, with, the, possible, exception, of, noctiluca, and, its, relatives, the, life, cycle, usually, involves, asexual, reproduction, by, means, of, mitosis, either, through, desmoschisis, or, eleuteroschisis, more, complex, life, cycles, occur, more, particularly, with, parasitic, dinoflagellates, sexual, reproduction, also, occurs, though, this, mode, of, reproduction, is, only, known, in, a, small, percentage, of, dinoflagellates, this, takes, place, by, fusion, of, two, individuals, to, form, a, zygote, which, may, remain, mobile, in, typical, dinoflagellate, fashion, and, is, then, called, a, planozygote, this, zygote, may, later, form, a, resting, stage, or, hypnozygote, which, is, called, a, dinoflagellate, cyst, or, dinocyst, after, or, before, germination, of, the, cyst, the, hatchling, undergoes, meiosis, to, produce, new, haploid, cells, dinoflagellates, appear, to, be, capable, of, carrying, out, several, dna, repair, processes, that, can, deal, with, different, types, of, dna, damage, the, life, cycle, of, many, dinoflagellates, includes, at, least, one, nonflagellated, benthic, stage, as, a, cyst, different, types, of, dinoflagellate, cysts, are, mainly, defined, based, on, morphological, number, and, type, of, layers, in, the, cell, wall, and, functional, long, or, short, term, endurance, differences, these, characteristics, were, initially, thought, to, clearly, distinguish, pellicle, thin, walled, cysts, from, resting, double, walled, dinoflagellate, cysts, the, former, were, considered, short, term, temporal, and, the, latter, long, term, resting, cysts, however, during, the, last, two, decades, further, knowledge, has, highlighted, the, great, intricacy, of, dinoflagellate, life, histories, more, than, 10, of, the, approximately, 2000, known, marine, dinoflagellate, species, produce, cysts, as, part, of, their, life, cycle, see, diagram, on, the, right, these, benthic, phases, play, an, important, role, in, the, ecology, of, the, species, as, part, of, a, planktonic, benthic, link, in, which, the, cysts, remain, in, the, sediment, layer, during, conditions, unfavorable, for, vegetative, growth, and, from, there, reinoculate, the, water, column, when, favorable, conditions, are, restored, indeed, during, dinoflagellate, evolution, the, need, to, adapt, to, fluctuating, environments, and, or, to, seasonality, is, thought, to, have, driven, the, development, of, this, life, cycle, stage, most, protists, form, dormant, cysts, in, order, to, withstand, starvation, and, uv, damage, however, there, are, enormous, differences, in, the, main, phenotypic, physiological, and, resistance, properties, of, each, dinoflagellate, species, cysts, unlike, in, higher, plants, most, of, this, variability, for, example, in, dormancy, periods, has, not, been, proven, yet, to, be, attributed, to, latitude, adaptation, or, to, depend, on, other, life, cycle, traits, thus, despite, recent, advances, in, the, understanding, of, the, life, histories, of, many, dinoflagellate, species, including, the, role, of, cyst, stages, many, gaps, remain, in, knowledge, about, their, origin, and, functionality, recognition, of, the, capacity, of, dinoflagellates, to, encyst, dates, back, to, the, early, 20th, century, in, biostratigraphic, studies, of, fossil, dinoflagellate, cysts, paul, reinsch, was, the, first, to, identify, cysts, as, the, fossilized, remains, of, dinoflagellates, later, cyst, formation, from, gamete, fusion, was, reported, which, led, to, the, conclusion, that, encystment, is, associated, with, sexual, reproduction, these, observations, also, gave, credence, to, the, idea, that, microalgal, encystment, is, essentially, a, process, whereby, zygotes, prepare, themselves, for, a, dormant, period, because, the, resting, cysts, studied, until, that, time, came, from, sexual, processes, dormancy, was, associated, with, sexuality, a, presumption, that, was, maintained, for, many, years, this, attribution, was, coincident, with, evolutionary, theories, about, the, origin, of, eukaryotic, cell, fusion, and, sexuality, which, postulated, advantages, for, species, with, diploid, resting, stages, in, their, ability, to, withstand, nutrient, stress, and, mutational, uv, radiation, through, recombinational, repair, and, for, those, with, haploid, vegetative, stages, as, asexual, division, doubles, the, number, of, cells, nonetheless, certain, environmental, conditions, may, limit, the, advantages, of, recombination, and, sexuality, such, that, in, fungi, for, example, complex, combinations, of, haploid, and, diploid, cycles, have, evolved, that, include, asexual, and, sexual, resting, stages, however, in, the, general, life, cycle, of, cyst, producing, dinoflagellates, as, outlined, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, resting, cysts, were, assumed, to, be, the, fate, of, sexuality, which, itself, was, regarded, as, a, response, to, stress, or, unfavorable, conditions, sexuality, involves, the, fusion, of, haploid, gametes, from, motile, planktonic, vegetative, stages, to, produce, diploid, planozygotes, that, eventually, form, cysts, or, hypnozygotes, whose, germination, is, subject, to, both, endogenous, and, exogenous, controls, endogenously, a, species, specific, physiological, maturation, minimum, period, dormancy, is, mandatory, before, germination, can, occur, thus, hypnozygotes, were, also, referred, to, as, resting, or, resistant, cysts, in, reference, to, this, physiological, trait, and, their, capacity, following, dormancy, to, remain, viable, in, the, sediments, for, long, periods, of, time, exogenously, germination, is, only, possible, within, a, window, of, favorable, environmental, conditions, yet, with, the, discovery, that, planozygotes, were, also, able, to, divide, it, became, apparent, that, the, complexity, of, dinoflagellate, life, cycles, was, greater, than, originally, thought, following, corroboration, of, this, behavior, in, several, species, the, capacity, of, dinoflagellate, sexual, phases, to, restore, the, vegetative, phase, bypassing, cyst, formation, became, well, accepted, further, in, 2006, kremp, and, parrow, showed, the, dormant, resting, cysts, of, the, baltic, cold, water, dinoflagellates, scrippsiella, hangoei, and, gymnodinium, sp, were, formed, by, the, direct, encystment, of, haploid, vegetative, cells, i, e, asexually, in, addition, for, the, zygotic, cysts, of, pfiesteria, piscicida, dormancy, was, not, essential, one, of, the, most, striking, features, of, dinoflagellates, is, the, large, amount, of, cellular, dna, that, they, contain, most, eukaryotic, algae, contain, on, average, about, 0, 54, pg, dna, cell, whereas, estimates, of, dinoflagellate, dna, content, range, from, 3, 250, pg, cell, corresponding, to, roughly, 3000, 215, 000, mb, in, comparison, the, haploid, human, genome, is, 3180, mb, and, hexaploid, triticum, wheat, is, 16, 000, mb, polyploidy, or, polyteny, may, account, for, this, large, cellular, dna, content, but, earlier, studies, of, dna, reassociation, kinetics, and, recent, genome, analyses, do, not, support, this, hypothesis, rather, this, has, been, attributed, hypothetically, to, the, rampant, retroposition, found, in, dinoflagellate, genomes, in, addition, to, their, disproportionately, large, genomes, dinoflagellate, nuclei, are, unique, in, their, morphology, regulation, and, composition, their, dna, is, so, tightly, packed, that, exactly, how, many, chromosomes, they, have, is, still, uncertain, the, dinoflagellates, share, an, unusual, mitochondrial, genome, organisation, with, their, relatives, the, apicomplexa, both, groups, have, very, reduced, mitochondrial, genomes, around, 6, kilobases, kb, in, the, apicomplexa, vs, 16kb, for, human, mitochondria, one, species, amoebophrya, ceratii, has, lost, its, mitochondrial, genome, completely, yet, still, has, functional, mitochondria, the, genes, on, the, dinoflagellate, genomes, have, undergone, a, number, of, reorganisations, including, massive, genome, amplification, and, recombination, which, have, resulted, in, multiple, copies, of, each, gene, and, gene, fragments, linked, in, numerous, combinations, loss, of, the, standard, stop, codons, trans, splicing, of, mrnas, for, the, mrna, of, cox3, and, extensive, rna, editing, recoding, of, most, genes, has, occurred, the, reasons, for, this, transformation, are, unknown, in, a, small, group, of, dinoflagellates, called, dinotoms, durinskia, and, kryptoperidinium, the, endosymbionts, diatoms, still, have, mitochondria, making, them, the, only, organisms, with, two, evolutionarily, distinct, mitochondria, in, most, of, the, species, the, plastid, genome, consist, of, just, 14, genes, the, dna, of, the, plastid, in, the, peridinin, containing, dinoflagellates, is, contained, in, a, series, of, small, circles, called, minicircles, each, circle, contains, one, or, two, polypeptide, genes, the, genes, for, these, polypeptides, are, chloroplast, specific, because, their, homologs, from, other, photosynthetic, eukaryotes, are, exclusively, encoded, in, the, chloroplast, genome, within, each, circle, is, a, distinguishable, core, region, genes, are, always, in, the, same, orientation, with, respect, to, this, core, region, in, terms, of, dna, barcoding, its, sequences, can, be, used, to, identify, species, where, a, genetic, distance, of, p, 0, 04, can, be, used, to, delimit, species, which, has, been, successfully, applied, to, resolve, long, standing, taxonomic, confusion, as, in, the, case, of, resolving, the, alexandrium, tamarense, complex, into, five, species, a, recent, study, revealed, a, substantial, proportion, of, dinoflagellate, genes, encode, for, unknown, functions, and, that, these, genes, could, be, conserved, and, lineage, specific, dinoflagellates, are, mainly, represented, as, fossils, by, dinocysts, which, have, a, long, geological, record, with, lowest, occurrences, during, the, mid, triassic, whilst, geochemical, markers, suggest, a, presence, to, the, early, cambrian, some, evidence, indicates, dinosteroids, in, many, paleozoic, and, precambrian, rocks, might, be, the, product, of, ancestral, dinoflagellates, protodinoflagellates, dinoflagellates, show, a, classic, radiation, of, morphologies, during, the, late, triassic, through, the, middle, jurassic, more, modern, looking, forms, proliferate, during, the, later, jurassic, and, cretaceous, this, trend, continues, into, the, cenozoic, albeit, with, some, loss, of, diversity, molecular, phylogenetics, show, that, dinoflagellates, are, grouped, with, ciliates, and, apicomplexans, sporozoa, in, a, well, supported, clade, the, alveolates, the, closest, relatives, to, dinokaryotic, dinoflagellates, appear, to, be, apicomplexans, perkinsus, parvilucifera, syndinians, and, oxyrrhis, molecular, phylogenies, are, similar, to, phylogenies, based, on, morphology, the, earliest, stages, of, dinoflagellate, evolution, appear, to, be, dominated, by, parasitic, lineages, such, as, perkinsids, and, syndinians, e, g, amoebophrya, and, hematodinium, all, dinoflagellates, contain, red, algal, plastids, or, remnant, nonphotosynthetic, organelles, of, red, algal, origin, the, parasitic, dinoflagellate, hematodinium, however, lacks, a, plastid, entirely, some, groups, that, have, lost, the, photosynthetic, properties, of, their, original, red, algae, plastids, has, obtained, new, photosynthetic, plastids, chloroplasts, through, so, called, serial, endosymbiosis, both, secondary, and, tertiary, like, their, original, plastids, the, new, chloroplasts, in, these, groups, can, be, traced, back, to, red, algae, except, from, those, in, the, members, of, the, genus, lepidodinium, which, possess, plastids, derived, from, green, algae, possibly, trebouxiophyceae, or, ulvophyceae, lineages, with, tertiary, endosymbiosis, are, dinophysis, with, plastids, from, a, cryptomonad, the, karenia, karlodinium, and, takayama, which, possess, plastids, of, haptophyte, origin, and, the, kryptoperidiniaceae, durinskia, and, kryptoperidinium, which, have, plastids, derived, from, diatoms, some, species, also, perform, kleptoplasty, dinoflagellate, evolution, has, been, summarized, into, five, principal, organizational, types, prorocentroid, dinophysoid, gonyaulacoid, peridinioid, and, gymnodinoid, the, transitions, of, marine, species, into, fresh, water, have, been, frequent, events, during, the, diversification, of, dinoflagellates, and, have, occurred, recently, many, dinoflagellates, also, have, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, cyanobacteria, called, cyanobionts, which, have, a, reduced, genome, and, has, not, been, found, outside, their, hosts, the, dinophysoid, dinoflagellates, have, two, genera, amphisolenia, and, triposolenia, that, contain, intracellular, cyanobionts, and, four, genera, citharistes, histioneis, parahistioneis, and, ornithocercus, that, contain, extracellular, cyanobionts, most, of, the, cyanobionts, are, used, for, nitrogen, fixation, not, for, photosynthesis, but, some, don, t, have, the, ability, to, fix, nitrogen, the, dinoflagellate, ornithocercus, magnificus, is, host, for, symbionts, which, resides, in, an, extracellular, chamber, while, it, is, not, fully, known, how, the, dinoflagellate, benefit, from, it, it, has, been, suggested, it, is, farming, the, cyanobacteria, in, specialized, chambers, and, regularly, digest, some, of, them, recently, the, living, fossil, dapsilidinium, pastielsii, was, found, inhabiting, the, indo, pacific, warm, pool, which, served, as, a, refugium, for, thermophilic, dinoflagellates, and, others, such, as, calciodinellum, operosum, and, posoniella, tricarinelloides, were, also, described, from, fossils, before, later, being, found,
