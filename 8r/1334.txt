lumbar, puncture, lp, also, known, as, a, spinal, tap, is, a, medical, procedure, in, which, a, needle, is, inserted, into, the, spinal, canal, most, commonly, to, collect, cerebrospinal, fluid, csf, for, diagnostic, testing, the, main, reason, for, a, lumbar, puncture, is, to, help, diagnose, diseases, of, the, central, nervous, system, including, the, brain, and, spine, examples, of, these, conditions, include, meningitis, and, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, it, may, also, be, used, therapeutically, in, some, conditions, increased, intracranial, pressure, pressure, in, the, skull, is, a, contraindication, due, to, risk, of, brain, matter, being, compressed, and, pushed, toward, the, spine, sometimes, lumbar, puncture, cannot, be, performed, safely, for, example, due, to, a, severe, bleeding, tendency, it, is, regarded, as, a, safe, procedure, but, post, dural, puncture, headache, is, a, common, side, effect, if, a, small, atraumatic, needle, is, not, used, the, procedure, is, typically, performed, under, local, anesthesia, using, a, sterile, technique, a, hypodermic, needle, is, used, to, access, the, subarachnoid, space, and, collect, fluid, fluid, may, be, sent, for, biochemical, microbiological, and, cytological, analysis, using, ultrasound, to, landmark, may, increase, success, lumbar, puncture, was, first, introduced, in, 1891, by, the, german, physician, heinrich, quincke, the, reason, for, a, lumbar, puncture, may, be, to, make, a, diagnosis, or, to, treat, a, disease, as, outlined, below, the, chief, diagnostic, indications, of, lumbar, puncture, are, for, collection, of, cerebrospinal, fluid, csf, analysis, of, csf, may, exclude, infectious, inflammatory, and, neoplastic, diseases, affecting, the, central, nervous, system, the, most, common, purpose, is, in, suspected, meningitis, since, there, is, no, other, reliable, tool, with, which, meningitis, a, life, threatening, but, highly, treatable, condition, can, be, excluded, a, lumbar, puncture, can, also, be, used, to, detect, whether, someone, has, stage, 1, or, stage, 2, trypanosoma, brucei, young, infants, commonly, require, lumbar, puncture, as, a, part, of, the, routine, workup, for, fever, without, a, source, this, is, due, to, higher, rates, of, meningitis, than, in, older, persons, infants, also, do, not, reliably, show, classic, symptoms, of, meningeal, irritation, meningismus, like, neck, stiffness, and, headache, the, way, adults, do, in, any, age, group, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, benign, intracranial, hypertension, and, many, other, diagnoses, may, be, supported, or, excluded, with, this, test, it, may, also, be, used, to, detect, the, presence, of, malignant, cells, in, the, csf, as, in, carcinomatous, meningitis, or, medulloblastoma, csf, containing, less, than, 10, red, blood, cells, rbcs, mm, 3, constitutes, a, negative, tap, in, the, context, of, a, workup, for, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, for, example, taps, that, are, positive, have, an, rbc, count, of, 100, mm, or, more, lumbar, punctures, may, also, be, done, to, inject, medications, into, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, intrathecally, particularly, for, spinal, anesthesia, or, chemotherapy, serial, lumbar, punctures, may, be, useful, in, temporary, treatment, of, idiopathic, intracranial, hypertension, iih, this, disease, is, characterized, by, increased, pressure, of, csf, which, may, cause, headache, and, permanent, loss, of, vision, while, mainstays, of, treatment, are, medication, in, some, cases, lumbar, puncture, performed, multiple, times, may, improve, symptoms, it, is, not, recommended, as, a, staple, of, treatment, due, to, discomfort, and, risk, of, the, procedure, and, the, short, duration, of, its, efficacy, additionally, some, people, with, normal, pressure, hydrocephalus, characterized, by, urinary, incontinence, a, changed, ability, to, walk, properly, and, dementia, receive, some, relief, of, symptoms, after, removal, of, csf, lumbar, puncture, should, not, be, performed, in, the, following, situations, post, dural, puncture, headache, with, nausea, is, the, most, common, complication, it, often, responds, to, pain, medications, and, infusion, of, fluids, it, was, long, taught, that, this, complication, can, be, prevented, by, strict, maintenance, of, a, supine, posture, for, two, hours, after, the, successful, puncture, this, has, not, been, borne, out, in, modern, studies, involving, large, numbers, of, people, doing, the, procedure, with, the, person, on, their, side, might, decrease, the, risk, intravenous, caffeine, injection, is, often, quite, effective, in, aborting, these, spinal, headaches, a, headache, that, is, persistent, despite, a, long, period, of, bedrest, and, occurs, only, when, sitting, up, may, be, indicative, of, a, csf, leak, from, the, lumbar, puncture, site, it, can, be, treated, by, more, bedrest, or, by, an, epidural, blood, patch, where, the, person, s, own, blood, is, injected, back, into, the, site, of, leakage, to, cause, a, clot, to, form, and, seal, off, the, leak, the, risk, of, headache, and, need, for, analgesia, and, blood, patch, is, much, reduced, if, atraumatic, needles, are, used, this, does, not, affect, the, success, rate, of, the, procedure, in, other, ways, although, the, cost, and, difficulty, are, similar, adoption, remains, low, at, only, 16, c, 2014, the, headaches, may, be, caused, by, inadvertent, puncture, of, the, dura, mater, contact, between, the, side, of, the, lumbar, puncture, needle, and, a, spinal, nerve, root, can, result, in, anomalous, sensations, paresthesia, in, a, leg, during, the, procedure, this, is, harmless, and, people, can, be, warned, about, it, in, advance, to, minimize, their, anxiety, if, it, should, occur, serious, complications, of, a, properly, performed, lumbar, puncture, are, extremely, rare, they, include, spinal, or, epidural, bleeding, adhesive, arachnoiditis, and, trauma, to, the, spinal, cord, or, spinal, nerve, roots, resulting, in, weakness, or, loss, of, sensation, or, even, paraplegia, the, latter, is, exceedingly, rare, since, the, level, at, which, the, spinal, cord, ends, normally, the, inferior, border, of, l1, although, it, is, slightly, lower, in, infants, is, several, vertebral, spaces, above, the, proper, location, for, a, lumbar, puncture, l3, l4, there, are, case, reports, of, lumbar, puncture, resulting, in, perforation, of, abnormal, dural, arterio, venous, malformations, resulting, in, catastrophic, epidural, hemorrhage, this, is, exceedingly, rare, the, procedure, is, not, recommended, when, epidural, infection, is, present, or, suspected, when, topical, infections, or, dermatological, conditions, pose, a, risk, of, infection, at, the, puncture, site, or, in, patients, with, severe, psychosis, or, neurosis, with, back, pain, some, authorities, believe, that, withdrawal, of, fluid, when, initial, pressures, are, abnormal, could, result, in, spinal, cord, compression, or, cerebral, herniation, others, believe, that, such, events, are, merely, coincidental, in, time, occurring, independently, as, a, result, of, the, same, pathology, that, the, lumbar, puncture, was, performed, to, diagnose, in, any, case, computed, tomography, of, the, brain, is, often, performed, prior, to, lumbar, puncture, if, an, intracranial, mass, is, suspected, csf, leaks, can, result, from, a, lumbar, puncture, procedure, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, are, enveloped, by, a, layer, of, cerebrospinal, fluid, 125, 150, ml, in, total, in, adults, which, acts, as, a, shock, absorber, and, provides, a, medium, for, the, transfer, of, nutrients, and, waste, products, the, majority, is, produced, by, the, choroid, plexus, in, the, brain, and, circulates, from, there, to, other, areas, before, being, reabsorbed, into, the, circulation, predominantly, by, the, arachnoid, granulations, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, can, be, accessed, most, safely, in, the, lumbar, cistern, below, the, first, or, second, lumbar, vertebrae, l1, or, l2, the, spinal, cord, terminates, conus, medullaris, nerves, continue, down, the, spine, below, this, but, in, a, loose, bundle, of, nerve, fibers, called, the, cauda, equina, there, is, lower, risk, with, inserting, a, needle, into, the, spine, at, the, level, of, the, cauda, equina, because, these, loose, fibers, move, out, of, the, way, of, the, needle, without, being, damaged, the, lumbar, cistern, extends, into, the, sacrum, up, to, the, s2, vertebra, the, person, is, usually, placed, on, their, side, left, more, commonly, than, right, the, patient, bends, the, neck, so, the, chin, is, close, to, the, chest, hunches, the, back, and, brings, knees, toward, the, chest, this, approximates, a, fetal, position, as, much, as, possible, patients, may, also, sit, on, a, stool, and, bend, their, head, and, shoulders, forward, the, area, around, the, lower, back, is, prepared, using, aseptic, technique, once, the, appropriate, location, is, palpated, local, anaesthetic, is, infiltrated, under, the, skin, and, then, injected, along, the, intended, path, of, the, spinal, needle, a, spinal, needle, is, inserted, between, the, lumbar, vertebrae, l3, l4, l4, l5, or, l5, s1, and, pushed, in, until, there, is, a, give, as, it, enters, the, lumbar, cistern, wherein, the, ligamentum, flavum, is, housed, the, needle, is, again, pushed, until, there, is, a, second, give, that, indicates, the, needle, is, now, past, the, dura, mater, the, arachnoid, membrane, and, the, dura, mater, exist, in, flush, contact, with, one, another, in, the, living, person, s, spine, due, to, fluid, pressure, from, csf, in, the, subarachnoid, space, pushing, the, arachnoid, membrane, out, towards, the, dura, therefore, once, the, needle, has, pierced, the, dura, mater, it, has, also, traversed, the, thinner, arachnoid, membrane, the, needle, is, then, in, the, subarachnoid, space, the, stylet, from, the, spinal, needle, is, then, withdrawn, and, drops, of, cerebrospinal, fluid, are, collected, the, opening, pressure, of, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, may, be, taken, during, this, collection, by, using, a, simple, column, manometer, the, procedure, is, ended, by, withdrawing, the, needle, while, placing, pressure, on, the, puncture, site, the, spinal, level, is, so, selected, to, avoid, spinal, injuries, in, the, past, the, patient, would, lie, on, their, back, for, at, least, six, hours, and, be, monitored, for, signs, of, neurological, problems, there, is, no, scientific, evidence, that, this, provides, any, benefit, the, technique, described, is, almost, identical, to, that, used, in, spinal, anesthesia, except, that, spinal, anesthesia, is, more, often, done, with, the, patient, in, a, seated, position, the, upright, seated, position, is, advantageous, in, that, there, is, less, distortion, of, spinal, anatomy, which, allows, for, easier, withdrawal, of, fluid, some, practitioners, prefer, it, for, lumbar, puncture, in, obese, patients, where, lying, on, their, side, would, cause, a, scoliosis, and, unreliable, anatomical, landmarks, however, opening, pressures, are, notoriously, unreliable, when, measured, in, the, seated, position, therefore, patients, will, ideally, lie, on, their, side, if, practitioners, need, to, measure, opening, pressure, reinsertion, of, the, stylet, may, decrease, the, rate, of, post, lumbar, puncture, headaches, although, not, available, in, all, clinical, settings, use, of, ultrasound, is, helpful, for, visualizing, the, interspinous, space, and, assessing, the, depth, of, the, spine, from, the, skin, use, of, ultrasound, reduces, the, number, of, needle, insertions, and, redirections, and, results, in, higher, rates, of, successful, lumbar, puncture, if, the, procedure, is, difficult, such, as, in, people, with, spinal, deformities, such, as, scoliosis, it, can, also, be, performed, under, fluoroscopy, under, continuous, x, ray, imaging, in, children, a, sitting, flexed, position, was, as, successful, as, lying, on, the, side, with, respect, to, obtaining, non, traumatic, csf, csf, for, culture, and, cell, count, there, was, a, higher, success, rate, in, obtaining, csf, in, the, first, attempt, in, infants, younger, than, 12, months, in, the, sitting, flexed, position, the, spine, of, an, infant, at, the, time, of, birth, differs, from, the, adult, spine, the, conus, medullaris, bottom, of, the, spinal, cord, terminates, at, the, level, of, l1, in, adults, but, may, range, in, term, neonates, newly, born, babies, from, l1, l3, levels, it, is, important, to, insert, the, spinal, needle, below, the, conus, medullaris, at, the, l3, l4, or, l4, l5, interspinous, levels, with, growth, of, the, spine, the, conus, typically, reaches, the, adult, level, l1, by, 2, years, of, age, the, ligamentum, flavum, and, dura, mater, are, not, as, thick, in, infants, and, children, as, they, are, in, adults, therefore, it, is, difficult, to, assess, when, the, needle, passes, through, them, into, the, subarachnoid, space, because, the, characteristic, pop, or, give, may, be, subtle, or, nonexistent, in, the, pediatric, lumbar, puncture, to, decrease, the, chances, of, inserting, the, spinal, needle, too, far, some, clinicians, use, the, cincinnati, method, this, method, involves, removing, the, stylet, of, the, spinal, needle, once, the, needle, has, advanced, through, the, dermis, after, removal, of, the, stylet, the, needle, is, inserted, until, csf, starts, to, come, out, of, the, needle, once, all, of, the, csf, is, collected, the, stylet, is, then, reinserted, before, removal, of, the, needle, lumbar, punctures, are, often, used, to, diagnose, or, verify, an, infection, in, very, young, babies, and, can, cause, quite, a, bit, of, pain, unless, appropriate, pain, control, is, used, analgesia, managing, pain, is, important, for, infants, undergoing, this, procedure, approaches, for, pain, control, include, topical, pain, medications, anaesthetics, such, as, lidocaine, the, most, effective, approach, for, pain, control, in, infants, who, require, a, lumbar, puncture, is, not, clear, analysis, of, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, generally, includes, a, cell, count, and, determination, of, the, glucose, and, protein, concentrations, the, other, analytical, studies, of, cerebrospinal, fluid, are, conducted, according, to, the, diagnostic, suspicion, increased, csf, pressure, can, indicate, congestive, heart, failure, cerebral, edema, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, hypo, osmolality, resulting, from, hemodialysis, meningeal, inflammation, purulent, meningitis, or, tuberculous, meningitis, hydrocephalus, or, pseudotumor, cerebri, in, the, setting, of, raised, pressure, or, normal, pressure, hydrocephalus, where, the, pressure, is, normal, but, there, is, excessive, csf, lumbar, puncture, may, be, therapeutic, decreased, csf, pressure, can, indicate, complete, subarachnoid, blockage, leakage, of, spinal, fluid, severe, dehydration, hyperosmolality, or, circulatory, collapse, significant, changes, in, pressure, during, the, procedure, can, indicate, tumors, or, spinal, blockage, resulting, in, a, large, pool, of, csf, or, hydrocephalus, associated, with, large, volumes, of, csf, the, presence, of, white, blood, cells, in, cerebrospinal, fluid, is, called, pleocytosis, a, small, number, of, monocytes, can, be, normal, the, presence, of, granulocytes, is, always, an, abnormal, finding, a, large, number, of, granulocytes, often, heralds, bacterial, meningitis, white, cells, can, also, indicate, reaction, to, repeated, lumbar, punctures, reactions, to, prior, injections, of, medicines, or, dyes, central, nervous, system, hemorrhage, leukemia, recent, epileptic, seizure, or, a, metastatic, tumor, when, peripheral, blood, contaminates, the, withdrawn, csf, a, common, procedural, complication, white, blood, cells, will, be, present, along, with, erythrocytes, and, their, ratio, will, be, the, same, as, that, in, the, peripheral, blood, the, finding, of, erythrophagocytosis, where, phagocytosed, erythrocytes, are, observed, signifies, haemorrhage, into, the, csf, that, preceded, the, lumbar, puncture, therefore, when, erythrocytes, are, detected, in, the, csf, sample, erythrophagocytosis, suggests, causes, other, than, a, traumatic, tap, such, as, intracranial, haemorrhage, and, haemorrhagic, herpetic, encephalitis, in, which, case, further, investigations, are, warranted, including, imaging, and, viral, culture, csf, can, be, sent, to, the, microbiology, lab, for, various, types, of, smears, and, cultures, to, diagnose, infections, several, substances, found, in, cerebrospinal, fluid, are, available, for, diagnostic, measurement, the, first, technique, for, accessing, the, dural, space, was, described, by, the, london, physician, walter, essex, wynter, in, 1889, he, developed, a, crude, cut, down, with, cannulation, in, four, patients, with, tuberculous, meningitis, the, main, purpose, was, the, treatment, of, raised, intracranial, pressure, rather, than, for, diagnosis, the, technique, for, needle, lumbar, puncture, was, then, introduced, by, the, german, physician, heinrich, quincke, who, credits, wynter, with, the, earlier, discovery, he, first, reported, his, experiences, at, an, internal, medicine, conference, in, wiesbaden, germany, in, 1891, he, subsequently, published, a, book, on, the, subject, the, lumbar, puncture, procedure, was, taken, to, the, united, states, by, arthur, h, wentworth, an, assistant, professor, at, the, harvard, medical, school, based, at, children, s, hospital, in, 1893, he, published, a, long, paper, on, diagnosing, cerebrospinal, meningitis, by, examining, spinal, fluid, however, he, was, criticized, by, antivivisectionists, for, having, obtained, spinal, fluid, from, children, he, was, acquitted, but, nevertheless, he, was, uninvited, from, the, then, forming, johns, hopkins, school, of, medicine, where, he, would, have, been, the, first, professor, of, pediatrics, historically, lumbar, punctures, were, also, employed, in, the, process, of, performing, a, pneumoencephalography, a, nowadays, obsolete, x, ray, imaging, study, of, the, brain, that, was, performed, extensively, from, the, 1920s, until, the, advent, of, modern, non, invasive, neuroimaging, techniques, such, as, mri, and, ct, in, the, 1970s, during, this, quite, painful, procedure, csf, was, replaced, with, air, or, some, other, gas, via, the, lumbar, puncture, in, order, to, enhance, the, appearance, of, certain, areas, of, the, brain, on, plain, radiographs
