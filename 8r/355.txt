parazoa, ahistozoa, sans, placozoa, sponges, or, sea, sponges, are, members, of, the, metazoan, phylum, porifera, p, r, f, r, p, p, r, if, r, por, meaning, pore, bearer, a, basal, animal, clade, and, a, sister, taxon, of, the, diploblasts, they, are, sessile, filter, feeders, that, are, bound, to, the, seabed, and, are, one, of, the, most, ancient, members, of, macrobenthos, with, many, historical, species, being, important, reef, building, organisms, sponges, are, multicellular, organisms, consisting, of, jelly, like, mesohyl, sandwiched, between, two, thin, layers, of, cells, and, usually, have, tube, like, bodies, full, of, pores, and, channels, that, allow, water, to, circulate, through, them, they, have, unspecialized, cells, that, can, transform, into, other, types, and, that, often, migrate, between, the, main, cell, layers, and, the, mesohyl, in, the, process, they, do, not, have, complex, nervous, digestive, or, circulatory, systems, instead, most, rely, on, maintaining, a, constant, water, flow, through, their, bodies, to, obtain, food, and, oxygen, and, to, remove, wastes, usually, via, flagella, movements, of, the, so, called, collar, cells, believed, to, be, some, of, the, most, basal, animals, alive, today, sponges, were, possibly, the, first, outgroup, to, branch, off, the, evolutionary, tree, from, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, animals, with, fossil, evidence, of, primitive, sponges, such, as, otavia, from, as, early, as, the, tonian, period, around, 800, mya, the, branch, of, zoology, that, studies, sponges, is, known, as, spongiology, the, term, sponge, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, word, sp, ngos, the, scientific, name, porifera, is, a, neuter, plural, of, the, modern, latin, term, porifer, which, comes, from, the, roots, porus, meaning, pore, opening, and, fer, meaning, bearing, or, carrying, sponges, are, similar, to, other, animals, in, that, they, are, multicellular, heterotrophic, lack, cell, walls, and, produce, sperm, cells, unlike, other, animals, they, lack, true, tissues, and, organs, some, of, them, are, radially, symmetrical, but, most, are, asymmetrical, the, shapes, of, their, bodies, are, adapted, for, maximal, efficiency, of, water, flow, through, the, central, cavity, where, the, water, deposits, nutrients, and, then, leaves, through, a, hole, called, the, osculum, the, single, celled, choanoflagellates, resemble, the, choanocyte, cells, of, sponges, which, are, used, to, drive, their, water, flow, systems, and, capture, most, of, their, food, this, along, with, phylogenetic, studies, of, ribosomal, molecules, have, been, used, as, morphological, evidence, to, suggest, sponges, are, the, sister, group, to, the, rest, of, animals, a, great, majority, are, marine, salt, water, species, ranging, in, habitat, from, tidal, zones, to, depths, exceeding, 8, 800, m, 5, 5, mi, though, there, are, freshwater, species, all, adult, sponges, are, sessile, meaning, that, they, attach, to, an, underwater, surface, and, remain, fixed, in, place, i, e, do, not, travel, while, in, their, larval, stage, of, life, they, are, motile, many, sponges, have, internal, skeletons, of, spicules, skeletal, like, fragments, of, calcium, carbonate, or, silicon, dioxide, and, or, spongin, a, modified, type, of, collagen, protein, an, internal, gelatinous, matrix, called, mesohyl, functions, as, an, endoskeleton, and, it, is, the, only, skeleton, in, soft, sponges, that, encrust, such, hard, surfaces, as, rocks, more, commonly, the, mesohyl, is, stiffened, by, mineral, spicules, by, spongin, fibers, or, both, 90, of, all, known, sponge, species, that, have, the, widest, range, of, habitats, including, all, freshwater, ones, are, demosponges, that, use, spongin, many, species, have, silica, spicules, whereas, some, species, have, calcium, carbonate, exoskeletons, calcareous, sponges, have, calcium, carbonate, spicules, and, in, some, species, calcium, carbonate, exoskeletons, are, restricted, to, relatively, shallow, marine, waters, where, production, of, calcium, carbonate, is, easiest, 179, the, fragile, glass, sponges, with, scaffolding, of, silica, spicules, are, restricted, to, polar, regions, and, the, ocean, depths, where, predators, are, rare, fossils, of, all, of, these, types, have, been, found, in, rocks, dated, from, 580, million, years, ago, in, addition, archaeocyathids, whose, fossils, are, common, in, rocks, from, 530, to, 490, million, years, ago, are, now, regarded, as, a, type, of, sponge, although, most, of, the, approximately, 5, 000, 10, 000, known, species, of, sponges, feed, on, bacteria, and, other, microscopic, food, in, the, water, some, host, photosynthesizing, microorganisms, as, endosymbionts, and, these, alliances, often, produce, more, food, and, oxygen, than, they, consume, a, few, species, of, sponges, that, live, in, food, poor, environments, have, evolved, as, carnivores, that, prey, mainly, on, small, crustaceans, most, sponges, reproduce, sexually, but, they, can, also, reproduce, asexually, sexually, reproducing, species, release, sperm, cells, into, the, water, to, fertilize, ova, released, or, retained, by, its, mate, or, mother, the, fertilized, eggs, develop, into, larvae, which, swim, off, in, search, of, places, to, settle, 183, 185, sponges, are, known, for, regenerating, from, fragments, that, are, broken, off, although, this, only, works, if, the, fragments, include, the, right, types, of, cells, some, species, reproduce, by, budding, when, environmental, conditions, become, less, hospitable, to, the, sponges, for, example, as, temperatures, drop, many, freshwater, species, and, a, few, marine, ones, produce, gemmules, survival, pods, of, unspecialized, cells, that, remain, dormant, until, conditions, improve, they, then, either, form, completely, new, sponges, or, recolonize, the, skeletons, of, their, parents, 120, 127, the, few, species, of, demosponge, that, have, entirely, soft, fibrous, skeletons, with, no, hard, elements, have, been, used, by, humans, over, thousands, of, years, for, several, purposes, including, as, padding, and, as, cleaning, tools, by, the, 1950s, though, these, had, been, overfished, so, heavily, that, the, industry, almost, collapsed, and, most, sponge, like, materials, are, now, synthetic, sponges, and, their, microscopic, endosymbionts, are, now, being, researched, as, possible, sources, of, medicines, for, treating, a, wide, range, of, diseases, dolphins, have, been, observed, using, sponges, as, tools, while, foraging, sponges, constitute, the, phylum, porifera, and, have, been, defined, as, sessile, metazoans, multicelled, immobile, animals, that, have, water, intake, and, outlet, openings, connected, by, chambers, lined, with, choanocytes, cells, with, whip, like, flagella, 29, however, a, few, carnivorous, sponges, have, lost, these, water, flow, systems, and, the, choanocytes, 39, all, known, living, sponges, can, remold, their, bodies, as, most, types, of, their, cells, can, move, within, their, bodies, and, a, few, can, change, from, one, type, to, another, even, if, a, few, sponges, are, able, to, produce, mucus, which, acts, as, a, microbial, barrier, in, all, other, animals, no, sponge, with, the, ability, to, secrete, a, functional, mucus, layer, has, been, recorded, without, such, a, mucus, layer, their, living, tissue, is, covered, by, a, layer, of, microbial, symbionts, which, can, contribute, up, to, 40, 50, of, the, sponge, wet, mass, this, inability, to, prevent, microbes, from, penetrating, their, porous, tissue, could, be, a, major, reason, why, they, have, never, evolved, a, more, complex, anatomy, like, cnidarians, jellyfish, etc, and, ctenophores, comb, jellies, and, unlike, all, other, known, metazoans, sponges, bodies, consist, of, a, non, living, jelly, like, mass, mesohyl, sandwiched, between, two, main, layers, of, cells, cnidarians, and, ctenophores, have, simple, nervous, systems, and, their, cell, layers, are, bound, by, internal, connections, and, by, being, mounted, on, a, basement, membrane, thin, fibrous, mat, also, known, as, basal, lamina, sponges, do, not, have, a, nervous, system, similar, to, that, of, vertebrates, but, may, have, one, that, is, quite, different, their, middle, jelly, like, layers, have, large, and, varied, populations, of, cells, and, some, types, of, cells, in, their, outer, layers, may, move, into, the, middle, layer, and, change, their, functions, a, sponge, s, body, is, hollow, and, is, held, in, shape, by, the, mesohyl, a, jelly, like, substance, made, mainly, of, collagen, and, reinforced, by, a, dense, network, of, fibers, also, made, of, collagen, 18, distinct, cell, types, have, been, identified, the, inner, surface, is, covered, with, choanocytes, cells, with, cylindrical, or, conical, collars, surrounding, one, flagellum, per, choanocyte, the, wave, like, motion, of, the, whip, like, flagella, drives, water, through, the, sponge, s, body, all, sponges, have, ostia, channels, leading, to, the, interior, through, the, mesohyl, and, in, most, sponges, these, are, controlled, by, tube, like, porocytes, that, form, closable, inlet, valves, pinacocytes, plate, like, cells, form, a, single, layered, external, skin, over, all, other, parts, of, the, mesohyl, that, are, not, covered, by, choanocytes, and, the, pinacocytes, also, digest, food, particles, that, are, too, large, to, enter, the, ostia, while, those, at, the, base, of, the, animal, are, responsible, for, anchoring, it, other, types, of, cells, live, and, move, within, the, mesohyl, many, larval, sponges, possess, neuron, less, eyes, that, are, based, on, cryptochromes, they, mediate, phototaxic, behavior, glass, sponges, present, a, distinctive, variation, on, this, basic, plan, their, spicules, which, are, made, of, silica, form, a, scaffolding, like, framework, between, whose, rods, the, living, tissue, is, suspended, like, a, cobweb, that, contains, most, of, the, cell, types, this, tissue, is, a, syncytium, that, in, some, ways, behaves, like, many, cells, that, share, a, single, external, membrane, and, in, others, like, a, single, cell, with, multiple, nuclei, most, sponges, work, rather, like, chimneys, they, take, in, water, at, the, bottom, and, eject, it, from, the, osculum, at, the, top, since, ambient, currents, are, faster, at, the, top, the, suction, effect, that, they, produce, by, bernoulli, s, principle, does, some, of, the, work, for, free, sponges, can, control, the, water, flow, by, various, combinations, of, wholly, or, partially, closing, the, osculum, and, ostia, the, intake, pores, and, varying, the, beat, of, the, flagella, and, may, shut, it, down, if, there, is, a, lot, of, sand, or, silt, in, the, water, although, the, layers, of, pinacocytes, and, choanocytes, resemble, the, epithelia, of, more, complex, animals, they, are, not, bound, tightly, by, cell, to, cell, connections, or, a, basal, lamina, thin, fibrous, sheet, underneath, the, flexibility, of, these, layers, and, re, modeling, of, the, mesohyl, by, lophocytes, allow, the, animals, to, adjust, their, shapes, throughout, their, lives, to, take, maximum, advantage, of, local, water, currents, 83, the, simplest, body, structure, in, sponges, is, a, tube, or, vase, shape, known, as, asconoid, but, this, severely, limits, the, size, of, the, animal, the, body, structure, is, characterized, by, a, stalk, like, spongocoel, surrounded, by, a, single, layer, of, choanocytes, if, it, is, simply, scaled, up, the, ratio, of, its, volume, to, surface, area, increases, because, surface, increases, as, the, square, of, length, or, width, while, volume, increases, proportionally, to, the, cube, the, amount, of, tissue, that, needs, food, and, oxygen, is, determined, by, the, volume, but, the, pumping, capacity, that, supplies, food, and, oxygen, depends, on, the, area, covered, by, choanocytes, asconoid, sponges, seldom, exceed, 1, mm, 0, 039, in, in, diameter, some, sponges, overcome, this, limitation, by, adopting, the, syconoid, structure, in, which, the, body, wall, is, pleated, the, inner, pockets, of, the, pleats, are, lined, with, choanocytes, which, connect, to, the, outer, pockets, of, the, pleats, by, ostia, this, increase, in, the, number, of, choanocytes, and, hence, in, pumping, capacity, enables, syconoid, sponges, to, grow, up, to, a, few, centimeters, in, diameter, the, leuconoid, pattern, boosts, pumping, capacity, further, by, filling, the, interior, almost, completely, with, mesohyl, that, contains, a, network, of, chambers, lined, with, choanocytes, and, connected, to, each, other, and, to, the, water, intakes, and, outlet, by, tubes, leuconid, sponges, grow, to, over, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, in, diameter, and, the, fact, that, growth, in, any, direction, increases, the, number, of, choanocyte, chambers, enables, them, to, take, a, wider, range, of, forms, for, example, encrusting, sponges, whose, shapes, follow, those, of, the, surfaces, to, which, they, attach, all, freshwater, and, most, shallow, water, marine, sponges, have, leuconid, bodies, the, networks, of, water, passages, in, glass, sponges, are, similar, to, the, leuconid, structure, in, all, three, types, of, structure, the, cross, section, area, of, the, choanocyte, lined, regions, is, much, greater, than, that, of, the, intake, and, outlet, channels, this, makes, the, flow, slower, near, the, choanocytes, and, thus, makes, it, easier, for, them, to, trap, food, particles, for, example, in, leuconia, a, small, leuconoid, sponge, about, 10, centimetres, 3, 9, in, tall, and, 1, centimetre, 0, 39, in, in, diameter, water, enters, each, of, more, than, 80, 000, intake, canals, at, 6, cm, per, minute, however, because, leuconia, has, more, than, 2, million, flagellated, chambers, whose, combined, diameter, is, much, greater, than, that, of, the, canals, water, flow, through, chambers, slows, to, 3, 6, cm, per, hour, making, it, easy, for, choanocytes, to, capture, food, all, the, water, is, expelled, through, a, single, osculum, at, about, 8, 5, cm, per, second, fast, enough, to, carry, waste, products, some, distance, away, in, zoology, a, skeleton, is, any, fairly, rigid, structure, of, an, animal, irrespective, of, whether, it, has, joints, and, irrespective, of, whether, it, is, biomineralized, the, mesohyl, functions, as, an, endoskeleton, in, most, sponges, and, is, the, only, skeleton, in, soft, sponges, that, encrust, hard, surfaces, such, as, rocks, more, commonly, the, mesohyl, is, stiffened, by, mineral, spicules, by, spongin, fibers, or, both, spicules, which, are, present, in, most, but, not, all, species, may, be, made, of, silica, or, calcium, carbonate, and, vary, in, shape, from, simple, rods, to, three, dimensional, stars, with, up, to, six, rays, spicules, are, produced, by, sclerocyte, cells, and, may, be, separate, connected, by, joints, or, fused, some, sponges, also, secrete, exoskeletons, that, lie, completely, outside, their, organic, components, for, example, sclerosponges, hard, sponges, have, massive, calcium, carbonate, exoskeletons, over, which, the, organic, matter, forms, a, thin, layer, with, choanocyte, chambers, in, pits, in, the, mineral, these, exoskeletons, are, secreted, by, the, pinacocytes, that, form, the, animals, skins, although, adult, sponges, are, fundamentally, sessile, animals, some, marine, and, freshwater, species, can, move, across, the, sea, bed, at, speeds, of, 1, 4, mm, 0, 039, 0, 157, in, per, day, as, a, result, of, amoeba, like, movements, of, pinacocytes, and, other, cells, a, few, species, can, contract, their, whole, bodies, and, many, can, close, their, oscula, and, ostia, juveniles, drift, or, swim, freely, while, adults, are, stationary, sponges, do, not, have, distinct, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, and, excretory, systems, instead, the, water, flow, system, supports, all, these, functions, they, filter, food, particles, out, of, the, water, flowing, through, them, particles, larger, than, 50, micrometers, cannot, enter, the, ostia, and, pinacocytes, consume, them, by, phagocytosis, engulfing, and, intracellular, digestion, particles, from, 0, 5, m, to, 50, m, are, trapped, in, the, ostia, which, taper, from, the, outer, to, inner, ends, these, particles, are, consumed, by, pinacocytes, or, by, archaeocytes, which, partially, extrude, themselves, through, the, walls, of, the, ostia, bacteria, sized, particles, below, 0, 5, micrometers, pass, through, the, ostia, and, are, caught, and, consumed, by, choanocytes, since, the, smallest, particles, are, by, far, the, most, common, choanocytes, typically, capture, 80, of, a, sponge, s, food, supply, archaeocytes, transport, food, packaged, in, vesicles, from, cells, that, directly, digest, food, to, those, that, do, not, at, least, one, species, of, sponge, has, internal, fibers, that, function, as, tracks, for, use, by, nutrient, carrying, archaeocytes, and, these, tracks, also, move, inert, objects, it, used, to, be, claimed, that, glass, sponges, could, live, on, nutrients, dissolved, in, sea, water, and, were, very, averse, to, silt, however, a, study, in, 2007, found, no, evidence, of, this, and, concluded, that, they, extract, bacteria, and, other, micro, organisms, from, water, very, efficiently, about, 79, and, process, suspended, sediment, grains, to, extract, such, prey, collar, bodies, digest, food, and, distribute, it, wrapped, in, vesicles, that, are, transported, by, dynein, motor, molecules, along, bundles, of, microtubules, that, run, throughout, the, syncytium, sponges, cells, absorb, oxygen, by, diffusion, from, water, into, cells, as, water, flows, through, body, into, which, carbon, dioxide, and, other, soluble, waste, products, such, as, ammonia, also, diffuse, archeocytes, remove, mineral, particles, that, threaten, to, block, the, ostia, transport, them, through, the, mesohyl, and, generally, dump, them, into, the, outgoing, water, current, although, some, species, incorporate, them, into, their, skeletons, in, waters, where, the, supply, of, food, particles, is, very, poor, some, species, prey, on, crustaceans, and, other, small, animals, so, far, only, 137, species, have, been, discovered, most, belong, to, the, family, cladorhizidae, but, a, few, members, of, the, guitarridae, and, esperiopsidae, are, also, carnivores, in, most, cases, little, is, known, about, how, they, actually, capture, prey, although, some, species, are, thought, to, use, either, sticky, threads, or, hooked, spicules, most, carnivorous, sponges, live, in, deep, waters, up, to, 8, 840, m, 5, 49, mi, and, the, development, of, deep, ocean, exploration, techniques, is, expected, to, lead, to, the, discovery, of, several, more, however, one, species, has, been, found, in, mediterranean, caves, at, depths, of, 17, 23, m, 56, 75, ft, alongside, the, more, usual, filter, feeding, sponges, the, cave, dwelling, predators, capture, crustaceans, under, 1, mm, 0, 039, in, long, by, entangling, them, with, fine, threads, digest, them, by, enveloping, them, with, further, threads, over, the, course, of, a, few, days, and, then, return, to, their, normal, shape, there, is, no, evidence, that, they, use, venom, most, known, carnivorous, sponges, have, completely, lost, the, water, flow, system, and, choanocytes, however, the, genus, chondrocladia, uses, a, highly, modified, water, flow, system, to, inflate, balloon, like, structures, that, are, used, for, capturing, prey, freshwater, sponges, often, host, green, algae, as, endosymbionts, within, archaeocytes, and, other, cells, and, benefit, from, nutrients, produced, by, the, algae, many, marine, species, host, other, photosynthesizing, organisms, most, commonly, cyanobacteria, but, in, some, cases, dinoflagellates, symbiotic, cyanobacteria, may, form, a, third, of, the, total, mass, of, living, tissue, in, some, sponges, and, some, sponges, gain, 48, to, 80, of, their, energy, supply, from, these, micro, organisms, in, 2008, a, university, of, stuttgart, team, reported, that, spicules, made, of, silica, conduct, light, into, the, mesohyl, where, the, photosynthesizing, endosymbionts, live, sponges, that, host, photosynthesizing, organisms, are, most, common, in, waters, with, relatively, poor, supplies, of, food, particles, and, often, have, leafy, shapes, that, maximize, the, amount, of, sunlight, they, collect, a, recently, discovered, carnivorous, sponge, that, lives, near, hydrothermal, vents, hosts, methane, eating, bacteria, and, digests, some, of, them, sponges, do, not, have, the, complex, immune, systems, of, most, other, animals, however, they, reject, grafts, from, other, species, but, accept, them, from, other, members, of, their, own, species, in, a, few, marine, species, gray, cells, play, the, leading, role, in, rejection, of, foreign, material, when, invaded, they, produce, a, chemical, that, stops, movement, of, other, cells, in, the, affected, area, thus, preventing, the, intruder, from, using, the, sponge, s, internal, transport, systems, if, the, intrusion, persists, the, grey, cells, concentrate, in, the, area, and, release, toxins, that, kill, all, cells, in, the, area, the, immune, system, can, stay, in, this, activated, state, for, up, to, three, weeks, sponges, have, three, asexual, methods, of, reproduction, after, fragmentation, by, budding, and, by, producing, gemmules, fragments, of, sponges, may, be, detached, by, currents, or, waves, they, use, the, mobility, of, their, pinacocytes, and, choanocytes, and, reshaping, of, the, mesohyl, to, re, attach, themselves, to, a, suitable, surface, and, then, rebuild, themselves, as, small, but, functional, sponges, over, the, course, of, several, days, the, same, capabilities, enable, sponges, that, have, been, squeezed, through, a, fine, cloth, to, regenerate, 239, a, sponge, fragment, can, only, regenerate, if, it, contains, both, collencytes, to, produce, mesohyl, and, archeocytes, to, produce, all, the, other, cell, types, a, very, few, species, reproduce, by, budding, 90, 94, gemmules, are, survival, pods, which, a, few, marine, sponges, and, many, freshwater, species, produce, by, the, thousands, when, dying, and, which, some, mainly, freshwater, species, regularly, produce, in, autumn, spongocytes, make, gemmules, by, wrapping, shells, of, spongin, often, reinforced, with, spicules, round, clusters, of, archeocytes, that, are, full, of, nutrients, 87, 88, freshwater, gemmules, may, also, include, photosynthesizing, symbionts, the, gemmules, then, become, dormant, and, in, this, state, can, survive, cold, drying, out, lack, of, oxygen, and, extreme, variations, in, salinity, freshwater, gemmules, often, do, not, revive, until, the, temperature, drops, stays, cold, for, a, few, months, and, then, reaches, a, near, normal, level, when, a, gemmule, germinates, the, archeocytes, round, the, outside, of, the, cluster, transform, into, pinacocytes, a, membrane, over, a, pore, in, the, shell, bursts, the, cluster, of, cells, slowly, emerges, and, most, of, the, remaining, archeocytes, transform, into, other, cell, types, needed, to, make, a, functioning, sponge, gemmules, from, the, same, species, but, different, individuals, can, join, forces, to, form, one, sponge, 89, 90, some, gemmules, are, retained, within, the, parent, sponge, and, in, spring, it, can, be, difficult, to, tell, whether, an, old, sponge, has, revived, or, been, recolonized, by, its, own, gemmules, most, sponges, are, hermaphrodites, function, as, both, sexes, simultaneously, although, sponges, have, no, gonads, reproductive, organs, sperm, are, produced, by, choanocytes, or, entire, choanocyte, chambers, that, sink, into, the, mesohyl, and, form, spermatic, cysts, while, eggs, are, formed, by, transformation, of, archeocytes, or, of, choanocytes, in, some, species, each, egg, generally, acquires, a, yolk, by, consuming, nurse, cells, during, spawning, sperm, burst, out, of, their, cysts, and, are, expelled, via, the, osculum, if, they, contact, another, sponge, of, the, same, species, the, water, flow, carries, them, to, choanocytes, that, engulf, them, but, instead, of, digesting, them, metamorphose, to, an, ameboid, form, and, carry, the, sperm, through, the, mesohyl, to, eggs, which, in, most, cases, engulf, the, carrier, and, its, cargo, 77, a, few, species, release, fertilized, eggs, into, the, water, but, most, retain, the, eggs, until, they, hatch, by, retaining, the, eggs, the, parents, can, transfer, symbiotic, microorganisms, directly, to, their, offspring, through, vertical, transmission, while, the, species, who, release, their, eggs, into, the, water, has, to, acquire, symbionts, horizontally, a, combination, of, both, is, probably, most, common, where, larvae, with, vertically, transmitted, symbionts, also, acquire, others, horizontally, there, are, four, types, of, larvae, but, all, are, lecithotrophic, non, feeding, balls, of, cells, with, an, outer, layer, of, cells, whose, flagella, or, cilia, enable, the, larvae, to, move, after, swimming, for, a, few, days, the, larvae, sink, and, crawl, until, they, find, a, place, to, settle, most, of, the, cells, transform, into, archeocytes, and, then, into, the, types, appropriate, for, their, locations, in, a, miniature, adult, sponge, 77, glass, sponge, embryos, start, by, dividing, into, separate, cells, but, once, 32, cells, have, formed, they, rapidly, transform, into, larvae, that, externally, are, ovoid, with, a, band, of, cilia, round, the, middle, that, they, use, for, movement, but, internally, have, the, typical, glass, sponge, structure, of, spicules, with, a, cobweb, like, main, syncitium, draped, around, and, between, them, and, choanosyncytia, with, multiple, collar, bodies, in, the, center, the, larvae, then, leave, their, parents, bodies, the, cytological, progression, of, porifera, oogenesis, and, spermatogenesis, gametogenesis, is, very, similar, to, that, of, other, metazoa, most, of, the, genes, from, the, classic, set, of, meiotic, genes, including, genes, for, dna, recombination, and, double, strand, break, repair, that, are, conserved, in, eukaryotes, are, expressed, in, the, sponges, e, g, geodia, hentscheli, and, geodia, phlegraei, since, porifera, are, considered, to, be, the, earliest, divergent, animals, these, findings, indicate, that, the, basic, toolkit, of, meiosis, including, capabilities, for, recombination, and, dna, repair, were, present, early, in, eukaryote, evolution, sponges, in, temperate, regions, live, for, at, most, a, few, years, but, some, tropical, species, and, perhaps, some, deep, ocean, ones, may, live, for, 200, years, or, more, some, calcified, demosponges, grow, by, only, 0, 2, mm, 0, 0079, in, per, year, and, if, that, rate, is, constant, specimens, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, wide, must, be, about, 5, 000, years, old, some, sponges, start, sexual, reproduction, when, only, a, few, weeks, old, while, others, wait, until, they, are, several, years, old, adult, sponges, lack, neurons, or, any, other, kind, of, nervous, tissue, however, most, species, have, the, ability, to, perform, movements, that, are, coordinated, all, over, their, bodies, mainly, contractions, of, the, pinacocytes, squeezing, the, water, channels, and, thus, expelling, excess, sediment, and, other, substances, that, may, cause, blockages, some, species, can, contract, the, osculum, independently, of, the, rest, of, the, body, sponges, may, also, contract, in, order, to, reduce, the, area, that, is, vulnerable, to, attack, by, predators, in, cases, where, two, sponges, are, fused, for, example, if, there, is, a, large, but, still, unseparated, bud, these, contraction, waves, slowly, become, coordinated, in, both, of, the, siamese, twins, the, coordinating, mechanism, is, unknown, but, may, involve, chemicals, similar, to, neurotransmitters, however, glass, sponges, rapidly, transmit, electrical, impulses, through, all, parts, of, the, syncytium, and, use, this, to, halt, the, motion, of, their, flagella, if, the, incoming, water, contains, toxins, or, excessive, sediment, myocytes, are, thought, to, be, responsible, for, closing, the, osculum, and, for, transmitting, signals, between, different, parts, of, the, body, sponges, contain, genes, very, similar, to, those, that, contain, the, recipe, for, the, post, synaptic, density, an, important, signal, receiving, structure, in, the, neurons, of, all, other, animals, however, in, sponges, these, genes, are, only, activated, in, flask, cells, that, appear, only, in, larvae, and, may, provide, some, sensory, capability, while, the, larvae, are, swimming, this, raises, questions, about, whether, flask, cells, represent, the, predecessors, of, true, neurons, or, are, evidence, that, sponges, ancestors, had, true, neurons, but, lost, them, as, they, adapted, to, a, sessile, lifestyle, sponges, are, worldwide, in, their, distribution, living, in, a, wide, range, of, ocean, habitats, from, the, polar, regions, to, the, tropics, most, live, in, quiet, clear, waters, because, sediment, stirred, up, by, waves, or, currents, would, block, their, pores, making, it, difficult, for, them, to, feed, and, breathe, the, greatest, numbers, of, sponges, are, usually, found, on, firm, surfaces, such, as, rocks, but, some, sponges, can, attach, themselves, to, soft, sediment, by, means, of, a, root, like, base, sponges, are, more, abundant, but, less, diverse, in, temperate, waters, than, in, tropical, waters, possibly, because, organisms, that, prey, on, sponges, are, more, abundant, in, tropical, waters, glass, sponges, are, the, most, common, in, polar, waters, and, in, the, depths, of, temperate, and, tropical, seas, as, their, very, porous, construction, enables, them, to, extract, food, from, these, resource, poor, waters, with, the, minimum, of, effort, demosponges, and, calcareous, sponges, are, abundant, and, diverse, in, shallower, non, polar, waters, the, different, classes, of, sponge, live, in, different, ranges, of, habitat, sponges, with, photosynthesizing, endosymbionts, produce, up, to, three, times, more, oxygen, than, they, consume, as, well, as, more, organic, matter, than, they, consume, such, contributions, to, their, habitats, resources, are, significant, along, australia, s, great, barrier, reef, but, relatively, minor, in, the, caribbean, many, sponges, shed, spicules, forming, a, dense, carpet, several, meters, deep, that, keeps, away, echinoderms, which, would, otherwise, prey, on, the, sponges, they, also, produce, toxins, that, prevent, other, sessile, organisms, such, as, bryozoans, or, sea, squirts, from, growing, on, or, near, them, making, sponges, very, effective, competitors, for, living, space, one, of, many, examples, includes, ageliferin, a, few, species, the, caribbean, fire, sponge, tedania, ignis, cause, a, severe, rash, in, humans, who, handle, them, turtles, and, some, fish, feed, mainly, on, sponges, it, is, often, said, that, sponges, produce, chemical, defenses, against, such, predators, however, experiments, have, been, unable, to, establish, a, relationship, between, the, toxicity, of, chemicals, produced, by, sponges, and, how, they, taste, to, fish, which, would, diminish, the, usefulness, of, chemical, defenses, as, deterrents, predation, by, fish, may, even, help, to, spread, sponges, by, detaching, fragments, however, some, studies, have, shown, fish, showing, a, preference, for, non, chemically, defended, sponges, and, another, study, found, that, high, levels, of, coral, predation, did, predict, the, presence, of, chemically, defended, species, glass, sponges, produce, no, toxic, chemicals, and, live, in, very, deep, water, where, predators, are, rare, spongeflies, also, known, as, spongillaflies, neuroptera, sisyridae, are, specialist, predators, of, freshwater, sponges, the, female, lays, her, eggs, on, vegetation, overhanging, water, the, larvae, hatch, and, drop, into, the, water, where, they, seek, out, sponges, to, feed, on, they, use, their, elongated, mouthparts, to, pierce, the, sponge, and, suck, the, fluids, within, the, larvae, of, some, species, cling, to, the, surface, of, the, sponge, while, others, take, refuge, in, the, sponge, s, internal, cavities, the, fully, grown, larvae, leave, the, water, and, spin, a, cocoon, in, which, to, pupate, the, caribbean, chicken, liver, sponge, chondrilla, nucula, secretes, toxins, that, kill, coral, polyps, allowing, the, sponges, to, grow, over, the, coral, skeletons, others, especially, in, the, family, clionaidae, use, corrosive, substances, secreted, by, their, archeocytes, to, tunnel, into, rocks, corals, and, the, shells, of, dead, mollusks, sponges, may, remove, up, to, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, per, year, from, reefs, creating, visible, notches, just, below, low, tide, level, caribbean, sponges, of, the, genus, aplysina, suffer, from, aplysina, red, band, syndrome, this, causes, aplysina, to, develop, one, or, more, rust, colored, bands, sometimes, with, adjacent, bands, of, necrotic, tissue, these, lesions, may, completely, encircle, branches, of, the, sponge, the, disease, appears, to, be, contagious, and, impacts, approximately, 10, percent, of, a, cauliformis, on, bahamian, reefs, the, rust, colored, bands, are, caused, by, a, cyanobacterium, but, it, is, unknown, whether, this, organism, actually, causes, the, disease, in, addition, to, hosting, photosynthesizing, endosymbionts, sponges, are, noted, for, their, wide, range, of, collaborations, with, other, organisms, the, relatively, large, encrusting, sponge, lissodendoryx, colombiensis, is, most, common, on, rocky, surfaces, but, has, extended, its, range, into, seagrass, meadows, by, letting, itself, be, surrounded, or, overgrown, by, seagrass, sponges, which, are, distasteful, to, the, local, starfish, and, therefore, protect, lissodendoryx, against, them, in, return, the, seagrass, sponges, get, higher, positions, away, from, the, sea, floor, sediment, shrimps, of, the, genus, synalpheus, form, colonies, in, sponges, and, each, shrimp, species, inhabits, a, different, sponge, species, making, synalpheus, one, of, the, most, diverse, crustacean, genera, specifically, synalpheus, regalis, utilizes, the, sponge, not, only, as, a, food, source, but, also, as, a, defense, against, other, shrimp, and, predators, as, many, as, 16, 000, individuals, inhabit, a, single, loggerhead, sponge, feeding, off, the, larger, particles, that, collect, on, the, sponge, as, it, filters, the, ocean, to, feed, itself, other, crustaceans, such, as, hermit, crabs, commonly, have, a, specific, species, of, sponge, pseudospongosorites, grow, on, them, as, both, the, sponge, and, crab, occupy, gastropod, shells, until, the, crab, and, sponge, outgrow, the, shell, eventually, resulting, in, the, crab, using, the, sponge, s, body, as, protection, instead, of, the, shell, until, the, crab, finds, a, suitable, replacement, shell, most, sponges, are, detritivores, which, filter, organic, debris, particles, and, microscopic, life, forms, from, ocean, water, in, particular, sponges, occupy, an, important, role, as, detritivores, in, coral, reef, food, webs, by, recycling, detritus, to, higher, trophic, levels, the, hypothesis, has, been, made, that, coral, reef, sponges, facilitate, the, transfer, of, coral, derived, organic, matter, to, their, associated, detritivores, via, the, production, of, sponge, detritus, as, shown, in, the, diagram, several, sponge, species, are, able, to, convert, coral, derived, dom, into, sponge, detritus, and, transfer, organic, matter, produced, by, corals, further, up, the, reef, food, web, corals, release, organic, matter, as, both, dissolved, and, particulate, mucus, as, well, as, cellular, material, such, as, expelled, symbiodinium, organic, matter, could, be, transferred, from, corals, to, sponges, by, all, these, pathways, but, dom, likely, makes, up, the, largest, fraction, as, the, majority, 56, to, 80, of, coral, mucus, dissolves, in, the, water, column, and, coral, loss, of, fixed, carbon, due, to, expulsion, of, symbiodinium, is, typically, negligible, 0, 01, compared, with, mucus, release, up, to, 40, coral, derived, organic, matter, could, also, be, indirectly, transferred, to, sponges, via, bacteria, which, can, also, consume, coral, mucus, besides, a, one, to, one, symbiotic, relationship, it, is, possible, for, a, host, to, become, symbiotic, with, a, microbial, consortium, resulting, in, a, diverse, sponge, microbiome, sponges, are, able, to, host, a, wide, range, of, microbial, communities, that, can, also, be, very, specific, the, microbial, communities, that, form, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, the, sponge, can, amount, to, as, much, as, 35, of, the, biomass, of, its, host, the, term, for, this, specific, symbiotic, relationship, where, a, microbial, consortia, pairs, with, a, host, is, called, a, holobiotic, relationship, the, sponge, as, well, as, the, microbial, community, associated, with, it, will, produce, a, large, range, of, secondary, metabolites, that, help, protect, it, against, predators, through, mechanisms, such, as, chemical, defense, some, of, these, relationships, include, endosymbionts, within, bacteriocyte, cells, and, cyanobacteria, or, microalgae, found, below, the, pinacoderm, cell, layer, where, they, are, able, to, receive, the, highest, amount, of, light, used, for, phototrophy, they, can, host, over, 50, different, microbial, phyla, and, candidate, phyla, including, alphaprotoebacteria, actinomycetota, chloroflexota, nitrospirota, cyanobacteria, the, taxa, gamma, the, candidate, phylum, poribacteria, and, thaumarchaea, carl, linnaeus, who, classified, most, kinds, of, sessile, animals, as, belonging, to, the, order, zoophyta, in, the, class, vermes, mistakenly, identified, the, genus, spongia, as, plants, in, the, order, algae, for, a, long, time, thereafter, sponges, were, assigned, to, subkingdom, parazoa, beside, the, animals, separated, from, the, eumetazoa, which, formed, the, rest, of, the, kingdom, animalia, they, have, been, regarded, as, a, paraphyletic, phylum, from, which, the, higher, animals, have, evolved, other, research, indicates, porifera, is, monophyletic, the, phylum, porifera, is, further, divided, into, classes, mainly, according, to, the, composition, of, their, skeletons, in, the, 1970s, sponges, with, massive, calcium, carbonate, skeletons, were, assigned, to, a, separate, class, sclerospongiae, otherwise, known, as, coralline, sponges, however, in, the, 1980s, it, was, found, that, these, were, all, members, of, either, the, calcarea, or, the, demospongiae, so, far, scientific, publications, have, identified, about, 9, 000, poriferan, species, of, which, about, 400, are, glass, sponges, about, 500, are, calcareous, species, and, the, rest, are, demosponges, however, some, types, of, habitat, vertical, rock, and, cave, walls, and, galleries, in, rock, and, coral, boulders, have, been, investigated, very, little, even, in, shallow, seas, sponges, were, traditionally, distributed, in, three, classes, calcareous, sponges, calcarea, glass, sponges, hexactinellida, and, demosponges, demospongiae, however, studies, have, now, shown, that, the, homoscleromorpha, a, group, thought, to, belong, to, the, demospongiae, has, a, genetic, relationship, well, separated, from, other, sponge, classes, 153, 154, therefore, they, have, recently, been, recognized, as, the, fourth, class, of, sponges, sponges, are, divided, into, classes, mainly, according, to, the, composition, of, their, skeletons, these, are, arranged, in, evolutionary, order, as, shown, below, in, ascending, order, of, their, evolution, from, top, to, bottom, although, molecular, clocks, and, biomarkers, suggest, sponges, existed, well, before, the, cambrian, explosion, of, life, silica, spicules, like, those, of, demosponges, are, absent, from, the, fossil, record, until, the, cambrian, an, unsubstantiated, 2002, report, exists, of, spicules, in, rocks, dated, around, 750, million, years, ago, well, preserved, fossil, sponges, from, about, 580, million, years, ago, in, the, ediacaran, period, have, been, found, in, the, doushantuo, formation, these, fossils, which, include, spicules, pinacocytes, porocytes, archeocytes, sclerocytes, and, the, internal, cavity, have, been, classified, as, demosponges, fossils, of, glass, sponges, have, been, found, from, around, 540, million, years, ago, in, rocks, in, australia, china, and, mongolia, early, cambrian, sponges, from, mexico, belonging, to, the, genus, kiwetinokia, show, evidence, of, fusion, of, several, smaller, spicules, to, form, a, single, large, spicule, calcium, carbonate, spicules, of, calcareous, sponges, have, been, found, in, early, cambrian, rocks, from, about, 530, to, 523, million, years, ago, in, australia, other, probable, demosponges, have, been, found, in, the, early, cambrian, chengjiang, fauna, from, 525, to, 520, million, years, ago, fossils, found, in, the, canadian, northwest, territories, dating, to, 890, million, years, ago, may, be, sponges, if, this, finding, is, confirmed, it, suggests, the, first, animals, appeared, before, the, neoproterozoic, oxygenation, event, freshwater, sponges, appear, to, be, much, younger, as, the, earliest, known, fossils, date, from, the, mid, eocene, period, about, 48, to, 40, million, years, ago, although, about, 90, of, modern, sponges, are, demosponges, fossilized, remains, of, this, type, are, less, common, than, those, of, other, types, because, their, skeletons, are, composed, of, relatively, soft, spongin, that, does, not, fossilize, well, the, earliest, sponge, symbionts, are, known, from, the, early, silurian, a, chemical, tracer, is, 24, isopropyl, cholestane, which, is, a, stable, derivative, of, 24, isopropyl, cholesterol, which, is, said, to, be, produced, by, demosponges, but, not, by, eumetazoans, true, animals, i, e, cnidarians, and, bilaterians, since, choanoflagellates, are, thought, to, be, animals, closest, single, celled, relatives, a, team, of, scientists, examined, the, biochemistry, and, genes, of, one, choanoflagellate, species, they, concluded, that, this, species, could, not, produce, 24, isopropylcholesterol, but, that, investigation, of, a, wider, range, of, choanoflagellates, would, be, necessary, in, order, to, prove, that, the, fossil, 24, isopropylcholestane, could, only, have, been, produced, by, demosponges, although, a, previous, publication, reported, traces, of, the, chemical, 24, isopropyl, cholestane, in, ancient, rocks, dating, to, 1, 800, million, years, ago, recent, research, using, a, much, more, accurately, dated, rock, series, has, revealed, that, these, biomarkers, only, appear, before, the, end, of, the, marinoan, glaciation, approximately, 635, million, years, ago, and, that, biomarker, analysis, has, yet, to, reveal, any, convincing, evidence, for, ancient, sponges, pre, dating, the, first, globally, extensive, neoproterozoic, glacial, episode, the, sturtian, 713, million, years, ago, in, oman, while, it, has, been, argued, that, this, sponge, biomarker, could, have, originated, from, marine, algae, recent, research, suggests, that, the, algae, s, ability, to, produce, this, biomarker, evolved, only, in, the, carboniferous, as, such, the, biomarker, remains, strongly, supportive, of, the, presence, of, demosponges, in, the, cryogenian, archaeocyathids, which, some, classify, as, a, type, of, coralline, sponge, are, very, common, fossils, in, rocks, from, the, early, cambrian, about, 530, to, 520, million, years, ago, but, apparently, died, out, by, the, end, of, the, cambrian, 490, million, years, ago, it, has, been, suggested, that, they, were, produced, by, sponges, cnidarians, algae, foraminiferans, a, completely, separate, phylum, of, animals, archaeocyatha, or, even, a, completely, separate, kingdom, of, life, labeled, archaeata, or, inferibionta, since, the, 1990s, archaeocyathids, have, been, regarded, as, a, distinctive, group, of, sponges, it, is, difficult, to, fit, chancelloriids, into, classifications, of, sponges, or, more, complex, animals, an, analysis, in, 1996, concluded, that, they, were, closely, related, to, sponges, on, the, grounds, that, the, detailed, structure, of, chancellorid, sclerites, armor, plates, is, similar, to, that, of, fibers, of, spongin, a, collagen, protein, in, modern, keratose, horny, demosponges, such, as, darwinella, however, another, analysis, in, 2002, concluded, that, chancelloriids, are, not, sponges, and, may, be, intermediate, between, sponges, and, more, complex, animals, among, other, reasons, because, their, skins, were, thicker, and, more, tightly, connected, than, those, of, sponges, in, 2008, a, detailed, analysis, of, chancelloriids, sclerites, concluded, that, they, were, very, similar, to, those, of, halkieriids, mobile, bilaterian, animals, that, looked, like, slugs, in, chain, mail, and, whose, fossils, are, found, in, rocks, from, the, very, early, cambrian, to, the, mid, cambrian, if, this, is, correct, it, would, create, a, dilemma, as, it, is, extremely, unlikely, that, totally, unrelated, organisms, could, have, developed, such, similar, sclerites, independently, but, the, huge, difference, in, the, structures, of, their, bodies, makes, it, hard, to, see, how, they, could, be, closely, related, fungi, choanoflagellates, glass, sponges, demosponges, calcareous, sponges, comb, jellies, placozoa, cnidaria, jellyfish, etc, other, metazoans, plants, fungi, most, demosponges, calcareous, sponges, homoscleromorpha, cnidaria, jellyfish, etc, other, metazoans, in, the, 1990s, sponges, were, widely, regarded, as, a, monophyletic, group, all, of, them, having, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, that, was, itself, a, sponge, and, as, the, sister, group, to, all, other, metazoans, multi, celled, animals, which, themselves, form, a, monophyletic, group, on, the, other, hand, some, 1990s, analyses, also, revived, the, idea, that, animals, nearest, evolutionary, relatives, are, choanoflagellates, single, celled, organisms, very, similar, to, sponges, choanocytes, which, would, imply, that, most, metazoa, evolved, from, very, sponge, like, ancestors, and, therefore, that, sponges, may, not, be, monophyletic, as, the, same, sponge, like, ancestors, may, have, given, rise, both, to, modern, sponges, and, to, non, sponge, members, of, metazoa, analyses, since, 2001, have, concluded, that, eumetazoa, more, complex, than, sponges, are, more, closely, related, to, particular, groups, of, sponges, than, to, other, sponge, groups, such, conclusions, imply, that, sponges, are, not, monophyletic, because, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, sponges, would, also, be, a, direct, ancestor, of, the, eumetazoa, which, are, not, sponges, a, study, in, 2001, based, on, comparisons, of, ribosome, dna, concluded, that, the, most, fundamental, division, within, sponges, was, between, glass, sponges, and, the, rest, and, that, eumetazoa, are, more, closely, related, to, calcareous, sponges, those, with, calcium, carbonate, spicules, than, to, other, types, of, sponge, in, 2007, one, analysis, based, on, comparisons, of, rna, and, another, based, mainly, on, comparison, of, spicules, concluded, that, demosponges, and, glass, sponges, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, either, is, to, the, calcareous, sponges, which, in, turn, are, more, closely, related, to, eumetazoa, other, anatomical, and, biochemical, evidence, links, the, eumetazoa, with, homoscleromorpha, a, sub, group, of, demosponges, a, comparison, in, 2007, of, nuclear, dna, excluding, glass, sponges, and, comb, jellies, concluded, that, the, sperm, of, homoscleromorpha, share, features, with, the, sperm, of, eumetazoa, that, sperm, of, other, sponges, lack, in, both, homoscleromorpha, and, eumetazoa, layers, of, cells, are, bound, together, by, attachment, to, a, carpet, like, basal, membrane, composed, mainly, of, typ, iv, collagen, a, form, of, collagen, not, found, in, other, sponges, although, the, spongin, fibers, that, reinforce, the, mesohyl, of, all, demosponges, is, similar, to, type, iv, collagen, the, analyses, described, above, concluded, that, sponges, are, closest, to, the, ancestors, of, all, metazoa, of, all, multi, celled, animals, including, both, sponges, and, more, complex, groups, however, another, comparison, in, 2008, of, 150, genes, in, each, of, 21, genera, ranging, from, fungi, to, humans, but, including, only, two, species, of, sponge, suggested, that, comb, jellies, ctenophora, are, the, most, basal, lineage, of, the, metazoa, included, in, the, sample, if, this, is, correct, either, modern, comb, jellies, developed, their, complex, structures, independently, of, other, metazoa, or, sponges, ancestors, were, more, complex, and, all, known, sponges, are, drastically, simplified, forms, the, study, recommended, further, analyses, using, a, wider, range, of, sponges, and, other, simple, metazoa, such, as, placozoa, however, reanalysis, of, the, data, showed, that, the, computer, algorithms, used, for, analysis, were, misled, by, the, presence, of, specific, ctenophore, genes, that, were, markedly, different, from, those, of, other, species, leaving, sponges, as, either, the, sister, group, to, all, other, animals, or, an, ancestral, paraphyletic, grade, family, trees, constructed, using, a, combination, of, all, available, data, morphological, developmental, and, molecular, concluded, that, the, sponges, are, in, fact, a, monophyletic, group, and, with, the, cnidarians, form, the, sister, group, to, the, bilaterians, a, very, large, and, internally, consistent, alignment, of, 1, 719, proteins, at, the, metazoan, scale, published, in, 2017, showed, that, i, sponges, represented, by, homoscleromorpha, calcarea, hexactinellida, and, demospongiae, are, monophyletic, ii, sponges, are, sister, group, to, all, other, multicellular, animals, iii, ctenophores, emerge, as, the, second, earliest, branching, animal, lineage, and, iv, placozoans, emerge, as, the, third, animal, lineage, followed, by, cnidarians, sister, group, to, bilaterians, in, march, 2021, scientists, from, dublin, found, additional, evidence, that, sponges, are, the, sister, group, to, all, other, animals, while, in, may, 2023, schultz, et, al, found, patterns, of, irreversible, change, in, genome, synteny, that, provide, strong, evidence, that, ctenophores, are, the, sister, group, to, all, other, animals, instead, a, report, in, 1997, described, use, of, sponges, as, a, tool, by, bottlenose, dolphins, in, shark, bay, in, western, australia, a, dolphin, will, attach, a, marine, sponge, to, its, rostrum, which, is, presumably, then, used, to, protect, it, when, searching, for, food, in, the, sandy, sea, bottom, the, behavior, known, as, sponging, has, only, been, observed, in, this, bay, and, is, almost, exclusively, shown, by, females, a, study, in, 2005, concluded, that, mothers, teach, the, behavior, to, their, daughters, and, that, all, the, sponge, users, are, closely, related, suggesting, that, it, is, a, fairly, recent, innovation, the, calcium, carbonate, or, silica, spicules, of, most, sponge, genera, make, them, too, rough, for, most, uses, but, two, genera, hippospongia, and, spongia, have, soft, entirely, fibrous, skeletons, 88, early, europeans, used, soft, sponges, for, many, purposes, including, padding, for, helmets, portable, drinking, utensils, and, municipal, water, filters, until, the, invention, of, synthetic, sponges, they, were, used, as, cleaning, tools, applicators, for, paints, and, ceramic, glazes, and, discreet, contraceptives, however, by, the, mid, 20th, century, overfishing, brought, both, the, animals, and, the, industry, close, to, extinction, many, objects, with, sponge, like, textures, are, now, made, of, substances, not, derived, from, poriferans, synthetic, sponges, include, personal, and, household, cleaning, tools, breast, implants, and, contraceptive, sponges, typical, materials, used, are, cellulose, foam, polyurethane, foam, and, less, frequently, silicone, foam, the, luffa, sponge, also, spelled, loofah, which, is, commonly, sold, for, use, in, the, kitchen, or, the, shower, is, not, derived, from, an, animal, but, mainly, from, the, fibrous, skeleton, of, the, sponge, gourd, luffa, aegyptiaca, cucurbitaceae, sponges, have, medicinal, potential, due, to, the, presence, in, sponges, themselves, or, their, microbial, symbionts, of, chemicals, that, may, be, used, to, control, viruses, bacteria, tumors, and, fungi, lacking, any, protective, shell, or, means, of, escape, sponges, have, evolved, to, synthesize, a, variety, of, unusual, compounds, one, such, class, is, the, oxidized, fatty, acid, derivatives, called, oxylipins, members, of, this, family, have, been, found, to, have, anti, cancer, anti, bacterial, and, anti, fungal, properties, one, example, isolated, from, the, okinawan, plakortis, sponges, plakoridine, a, has, shown, potential, as, a, cytotoxin, to, murine, lymphoma, cells
