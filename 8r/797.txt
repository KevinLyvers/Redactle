the, moose, pl, moose, used, in, north, america, or, elk, pl, elk, or, elks, used, in, eurasia, alces, alces, is, the, world, s, tallest, largest, and, heaviest, extant, species, of, deer, and, the, only, species, in, the, genus, alces, it, is, also, the, tallest, and, the, second, largest, land, animal, in, north, america, falling, short, only, of, the, american, bison, in, body, mass, most, adult, male, moose, have, broad, palmate, open, hand, shaped, antlers, other, members, of, the, deer, family, have, pointed, antlers, with, a, dendritic, twig, like, configuration, moose, inhabit, the, circumpolar, boreal, forests, or, temperate, broadleaf, and, mixed, forests, of, the, northern, hemisphere, thriving, in, cooler, temperate, areas, as, well, as, subarctic, climates, hunting, shaped, the, relationship, between, moose, and, humans, both, in, eurasia, and, north, america, prior, to, the, colonial, era, around, 1600, 1700, ce, moose, were, one, of, many, valuable, sources, of, sustenance, for, certain, tribal, groups, and, first, nations, hunting, and, habitat, loss, have, reduced, the, moose, s, range, this, fragmentation, has, led, to, sightings, of, urban, moose, in, some, areas, the, moose, has, been, reintroduced, to, some, of, its, former, habitats, currently, the, greatest, populations, occur, in, canada, where, they, can, be, found, in, all, provinces, excepting, nunavut, and, prince, edward, island, additionally, substantial, numbers, of, moose, are, found, in, alaska, new, england, with, maine, having, the, most, of, the, contiguous, united, states, new, york, state, fennoscandia, the, baltic, states, the, caucasus, region, belarus, poland, eastern, europe, mongolia, kazakhstan, and, russia, in, the, united, states, outside, of, alaska, and, new, england, most, moose, are, found, further, to, the, north, west, and, northeast, including, colorado, idaho, michigan, minnesota, montana, north, dakota, utah, vermont, wisconsin, and, wyoming, and, individuals, have, been, documented, wandering, as, far, south, as, western, oklahoma, northeastern, arizona, and, northwestern, new, mexico, predominantly, a, browser, the, moose, s, diet, consists, of, both, terrestrial, and, aquatic, vegetation, depending, on, the, season, with, branches, twigs, and, dead, wood, making, up, a, large, portion, of, their, winter, diet, predators, of, moose, include, wolves, bears, humans, wolverines, rarely, though, may, take, calves, and, rarely, if, swimming, in, the, ocean, orcas, unlike, most, other, deer, species, moose, do, not, form, herds, and, are, solitary, animals, aside, from, calves, who, remain, with, their, mother, until, the, cow, begins, estrus, again, typically, 18, months, after, the, birth, of, a, calf, at, this, point, the, cow, chases, their, calf, away, although, generally, slow, moving, and, sedentary, moose, can, become, defensively, aggressive, and, move, very, quickly, if, angered, or, startled, their, mating, season, in, the, autumn, features, energetic, fights, between, males, competing, for, a, female, alces, alces, is, called, a, moose, in, north, american, english, but, an, elk, in, british, english, the, word, elk, in, north, american, english, refers, to, a, completely, different, species, of, deer, cervus, canadensis, also, called, the, wapiti, from, algonquin, a, mature, male, moose, is, called, a, bull, a, mature, female, a, cow, and, an, immature, moose, of, either, sex, a, calf, in, classical, antiquity, the, animal, was, known, as, lk, in, greek, and, alces, in, latin, words, probably, borrowed, from, a, germanic, language, or, another, language, of, northern, europe, by, the, 8th, century, during, the, early, middle, ages, the, species, was, known, as, old, english, elch, elh, eolh, derived, from, the, proto, germanic, elho, elhon, and, possibly, connected, with, the, old, norse, elgr, later, the, species, became, known, in, middle, english, as, elk, elcke, or, elke, appearing, in, the, latinized, form, alke, with, the, spelling, alce, borrowed, directly, from, latin, alces, the, word, elk, remained, in, usage, because, of, english, speakers, familiarity, with, the, species, in, continental, europe, however, without, any, living, animals, around, to, serve, as, a, reference, the, meaning, became, rather, vague, and, by, the, 17th, century, elk, had, a, meaning, similar, to, large, deer, dictionaries, of, the, 18th, century, simply, described, elk, as, a, deer, that, was, as, large, as, a, horse, the, word, moose, had, first, entered, english, by, 1606, and, is, borrowed, from, the, algonquian, languages, compare, the, narragansett, moos, and, eastern, abenaki, mos, according, to, early, sources, these, were, likely, derived, from, moosu, meaning, he, strips, off, and, possibly, involved, forms, from, multiple, languages, mutually, reinforcing, one, another, the, proto, algonquian, form, was, mo, swa, on, average, an, adult, moose, stands, 1, 4, 2, 1, m, 4, ft, 7, in, 6, ft, 11, in, high, at, the, shoulder, which, is, more, than, 30, centimetres, 1, ft, higher, than, the, next, largest, deer, on, average, the, wapiti, the, tail, is, short, 6, cm, to, 8, cm, in, length, and, vestigial, in, appearance, unlike, other, ungulates, the, moose, tail, is, too, short, to, swish, away, insects, males, or, bulls, normally, weigh, from, 380, to, 700, kg, 838, to, 1, 543, lb, and, females, or, cows, typically, weigh, 200, to, 490, kg, 441, to, 1, 080, lb, depending, on, racial, or, clinal, as, well, as, individual, age, or, nutritional, variations, the, head, and, body, length, is, 2, 4, 3, 1, m, 7, ft, 10, in, 10, ft, 2, in, with, the, vestigial, tail, adding, only, a, further, 5, 12, cm, 2, 4, 1, 2, in, the, largest, of, all, the, races, is, the, alaskan, subspecies, a, a, gigas, which, can, stand, over, 2, 1, m, 6, ft, 11, in, at, the, shoulder, has, a, span, across, the, antlers, of, 1, 8, m, 5, ft, 11, in, and, averages, 634, 5, kg, 1, 399, lb, in, males, and, 478, kg, 1, 054, lb, in, females, typically, however, the, antlers, of, a, mature, bull, are, between, 1, 2, and, 1, 5, m, 3, ft, 11, in, and, 4, ft, 11, in, the, largest, confirmed, size, for, this, species, was, a, bull, shot, at, the, yukon, river, in, september, 1897, that, weighed, 820, kg, 1, 808, lb, and, measured, 2, 33, m, 7, ft, 8, in, high, at, the, shoulder, there, have, been, reported, cases, of, even, larger, moose, including, a, bull, killed, in, 2004, that, weighed, 1, 043, kg, 2, 299, lb, and, a, bull, that, reportedly, scaled, 1, 180, kg, 2, 601, lb, but, none, are, authenticated, and, some, may, not, be, considered, reliable, bull, moose, have, antlers, like, other, members, of, the, deer, family, the, size, and, growth, rate, of, antlers, is, determined, by, diet, and, age, size, and, symmetry, in, the, number, of, antler, points, signals, bull, moose, health, and, cows, may, select, mates, based, on, antler, size, and, symmetry, bull, moose, use, their, antlers, to, display, dominance, to, discourage, competition, and, to, spar, or, fight, rivals, the, male, s, antlers, grow, as, cylindrical, beams, projecting, on, each, side, of, the, head, at, right, angles, to, the, midline, of, the, skull, and, then, fork, the, lower, prong, of, this, fork, may, be, either, simple, or, divided, into, two, or, three, tines, with, some, flattening, most, moose, have, antlers, that, are, broad, and, palmate, flat, with, tines, points, along, the, outer, edge, within, the, ecologic, range, of, the, moose, in, europe, northern, populations, display, the, palmate, pattern, of, antlers, while, the, antlers, of, european, moose, residing, the, southerly, portion, of, its, range, are, typically, of, the, cervina, dendritic, pattern, and, comparatively, small, perhaps, due, to, evolutionary, pressures, of, hunting, by, humans, who, prize, the, large, palmate, antlers, european, moose, with, antlers, intermediate, between, the, palmate, and, the, dendritic, form, are, found, in, the, middle, of, the, north, south, range, moose, with, antlers, have, more, acute, hearing, than, those, without, antlers, a, study, of, trophy, antlers, using, a, microphone, found, that, the, palmate, antler, acts, as, a, parabolic, reflector, amplifying, sound, at, the, moose, s, ear, the, antlers, of, mature, alaskan, adult, bull, moose, 5, to, 12, years, old, have, a, normal, maximum, spread, greater, than, 200, centimeters, 79, in, by, the, age, of, 13, moose, antlers, decline, in, size, and, symmetry, the, widest, spread, recorded, was, 210, centimeters, 83, in, across, an, alaskan, moose, also, holds, the, record, for, the, heaviest, weight, at, 36, kilograms, 79, lb, antler, beam, diameter, not, the, number, of, tines, indicates, age, in, north, america, moose, a, a, americanus, antlers, are, usually, larger, than, those, of, eurasian, moose, and, have, two, lobes, on, each, side, like, a, butterfly, eurasian, moose, antlers, resemble, a, seashell, with, a, single, lobe, on, each, side, in, the, north, siberian, moose, a, a, bedfordiae, the, posterior, division, of, the, main, fork, divides, into, three, tines, with, no, distinct, flattening, in, the, common, moose, a, a, alces, this, branch, usually, expands, into, a, broad, palmation, with, one, large, tine, at, the, base, and, a, number, of, smaller, snags, on, the, free, border, there, is, however, a, scandinavian, breed, of, the, common, moose, in, which, the, antlers, are, simpler, and, recall, those, of, the, east, siberian, animals, the, palmation, appears, to, be, more, marked, in, north, american, moose, than, in, the, typical, scandinavian, moose, after, the, mating, season, males, drop, their, antlers, to, conserve, energy, for, the, winter, a, new, set, of, antlers, will, then, regrow, in, the, spring, antlers, take, three, to, five, months, to, fully, develop, making, them, one, of, the, fastest, growing, animal, organs, antler, growth, is, nourished, by, an, extensive, system, of, blood, vessels, in, the, skin, covering, which, contains, numerous, hair, follicles, that, give, it, a, velvet, texture, this, requires, intense, grazing, on, a, highly, nutritious, diet, by, september, the, velvet, is, removed, by, rubbing, and, thrashing, which, changes, the, colour, of, the, antlers, immature, bulls, may, not, shed, their, antlers, for, the, winter, but, retain, them, until, the, following, spring, birds, carnivores, and, rodents, eat, dropped, antlers, as, they, are, full, of, protein, and, moose, themselves, will, eat, antler, velvet, for, the, nutrients, if, a, bull, moose, is, castrated, either, by, accidental, or, chemical, means, he, will, shed, his, current, set, of, antlers, within, two, weeks, and, then, immediately, begin, to, grow, a, new, set, of, misshapen, and, deformed, antlers, that, he, will, wear, the, rest, of, his, life, without, ever, shedding, again, similarly, deformed, antlers, can, result, from, a, deficiency, of, testosterone, caused, by, cryptorchidism, or, old, age, these, deformed, antlers, are, composed, of, living, bone, which, is, still, growing, or, able, to, grow, since, testosterone, is, needed, to, stop, antler, growth, they, may, take, one, of, two, forms, cactus, antlers, or, velericorn, antlers, usually, retain, the, approximate, shape, of, a, normal, moose, s, antlers, but, have, numerous, pearl, shaped, exostoses, on, their, surface, being, made, of, living, bone, they, are, easily, broken, but, can, grow, back, perukes, us, p, r, u, k, s, are, constantly, growing, tumor, like, antlers, with, a, distinctive, appearance, similar, to, coral, like, roe, deer, moose, are, more, likely, to, develop, perukes, rather, than, cactus, antlers, than, the, more, developed, cervine, deer, but, unlike, roe, deer, moose, do, not, suffer, fatal, decalcification, of, the, skull, as, a, result, of, peruke, growth, but, rather, can, support, their, continued, growth, until, they, become, too, large, to, be, fully, supplied, with, blood, the, distinctive, looking, perukes, often, referred, to, as, devil, s, antlers, are, the, source, of, several, myths, and, legends, among, many, groups, of, inuit, as, well, as, several, other, tribes, of, indigenous, peoples, of, north, america, in, extremely, rare, circumstances, a, cow, moose, may, grow, antlers, this, is, usually, attributed, to, a, hormone, imbalance, the, moose, proboscis, is, distinctive, among, living, cervids, due, to, its, large, size, it, also, features, nares, that, can, be, sealed, shut, when, the, moose, is, browsing, aquatic, vegetation, the, moose, proboscis, likely, evolved, as, an, adaptation, to, aquatic, browsing, with, loss, of, the, rhinarium, and, development, of, a, superior, olfactory, column, separate, from, an, inferior, respiratory, column, this, separation, contributes, to, the, moose, s, keen, sense, of, smell, which, they, employ, to, detect, water, sources, to, find, food, under, snow, and, to, detect, mates, or, predators, as, with, all, members, of, the, order, artiodactyla, even, toed, ungulates, moose, feet, have, two, large, keratinized, hooves, corresponding, to, the, third, and, fourth, toe, with, two, small, posterolateral, dewclaws, vestigial, digits, corresponding, to, the, second, and, fifth, toe, the, hoof, of, the, fourth, digit, is, broader, than, that, of, the, third, digit, while, the, inner, hoof, of, the, third, digit, is, longer, than, that, of, the, fourth, digit, this, foot, configuration, may, favor, striding, on, soft, ground, the, moose, hoof, splays, under, load, increasing, surface, area, which, limits, sinking, of, the, moose, foot, into, soft, ground, or, snow, and, which, increases, efficiency, when, swimming, the, body, weight, per, footprint, surface, area, of, the, moose, foot, is, intermediate, between, that, of, the, pronghorn, foot, which, have, stiff, feet, lacking, dewclaws, optimized, for, high, speed, running, and, the, caribou, foot, which, are, more, rounded, with, large, dewclaws, optimized, for, walking, in, deep, snow, the, moose, s, body, weight, per, surface, area, of, footprint, is, about, twice, that, of, the, caribou, moose, skin, is, typical, of, the, deer, family, moose, fur, consists, of, four, types, of, hair, eyelashes, whiskers, guard, hairs, and, wool, hairs, hair, length, and, hair, density, varies, according, to, season, age, and, body, region, the, coat, has, two, layers, a, top, layer, of, long, guard, hairs, and, a, soft, wooly, undercoat, the, guard, hairs, are, hollow, and, filled, with, air, for, better, insulation, which, also, helps, them, stay, afloat, when, swimming, both, male, and, female, moose, have, a, dewlap, or, bell, which, is, a, fold, of, skin, under, the, chin, its, exact, function, is, unknown, but, some, morphologic, analyses, suggest, a, cooling, thermoregulatory, function, other, theories, include, a, fitness, signal, in, mating, as, a, visual, and, olfactory, signal, or, as, a, dominance, signal, by, males, as, are, the, antlers, the, moose, is, a, browsing, herbivore, and, is, capable, of, consuming, many, types, of, plant, or, fruit, the, average, adult, moose, needs, to, consume, 96, megajoules, 23, 000, kilocalories, per, day, to, maintain, its, body, weight, much, of, a, moose, s, energy, is, derived, from, terrestrial, vegetation, mainly, consisting, of, forbs, and, other, non, grasses, and, fresh, shoots, from, trees, such, as, willow, and, birch, as, these, terrestrial, plants, are, rather, low, in, sodium, as, much, as, half, of, its, diet, usually, consists, of, aquatic, plants, including, lilies, and, pondweed, which, while, lower, in, energy, content, provide, the, moose, with, its, sodium, requirements, in, winter, moose, are, often, drawn, to, roadways, to, lick, salt, that, is, used, as, a, snow, and, ice, melter, a, typical, moose, weighing, 360, kg, 794, lb, can, eat, up, to, 32, kg, 71, lb, of, food, per, day, moose, lack, upper, front, teeth, but, have, eight, sharp, incisors, on, the, lower, jaw, they, also, have, a, tough, tongue, lips, and, gums, which, aid, in, the, eating, of, woody, vegetation, moose, have, six, pairs, of, large, flat, molars, and, ahead, of, those, six, pairs, of, premolars, to, grind, up, their, food, a, moose, s, upper, lip, is, very, sensitive, to, help, distinguish, between, fresh, shoots, and, harder, twigs, and, is, prehensile, for, grasping, their, food, in, the, summer, moose, may, use, this, prehensile, lip, for, grabbing, branches, and, pulling, stripping, the, entire, branch, of, leaves, in, a, single, mouthful, or, for, pulling, forbs, like, dandelions, or, aquatic, plants, up, by, the, base, roots, and, all, a, moose, s, diet, often, depends, on, its, location, but, they, seem, to, prefer, the, new, growths, from, deciduous, trees, with, a, high, sugar, content, such, as, white, birch, trembling, aspen, and, striped, maple, among, many, others, to, reach, high, branches, a, moose, may, bend, small, saplings, down, using, its, prehensile, lip, mouth, or, body, for, larger, trees, a, moose, may, stand, erect, and, walk, upright, on, its, hind, legs, allowing, it, to, reach, branches, up, to, 4, 26, meters, 14, ft, 0, in, or, higher, above, the, ground, moose, are, excellent, swimmers, and, are, known, to, wade, into, water, to, eat, aquatic, plants, this, trait, serves, a, second, purpose, in, cooling, down, the, moose, on, summer, days, and, ridding, itself, of, black, flies, moose, are, thus, attracted, to, marshes, and, river, banks, during, warmer, months, as, both, provide, suitable, vegetation, to, eat, and, water, to, wet, themselves, in, moose, have, been, known, to, dive, over, 5, 5, metres, 18, ft, to, reach, plants, on, lake, bottoms, and, the, complex, snout, may, assist, the, moose, in, this, type, of, feeding, moose, are, the, only, deer, that, are, capable, of, feeding, underwater, as, an, adaptation, for, feeding, on, plants, underwater, the, nose, is, equipped, with, fatty, pads, and, muscles, that, close, the, nostrils, when, exposed, to, water, pressure, preventing, water, from, entering, the, nose, other, species, can, pluck, plants, from, the, water, too, but, these, need, to, raise, their, heads, in, order, to, swallow, moose, are, not, grazing, animals, but, browsers, concentrate, selectors, like, giraffes, moose, carefully, select, foods, with, less, fiber, and, more, concentrations, of, nutrients, thus, the, moose, s, digestive, system, has, evolved, to, accommodate, this, relatively, low, fiber, diet, unlike, most, hooved, domesticated, animals, ruminants, moose, cannot, digest, hay, and, feeding, it, to, a, moose, can, be, fatal, the, moose, s, varied, and, complex, diet, is, typically, expensive, for, humans, to, provide, and, free, range, moose, require, a, lot, of, forested, hectarage, for, sustainable, survival, which, is, one, of, the, main, reasons, moose, have, never, been, widely, domesticated, a, full, grown, moose, has, few, enemies, except, siberian, tigers, panthera, tigris, tigris, which, regularly, prey, on, adult, moose, but, a, pack, of, gray, wolves, canis, lupus, can, still, pose, a, threat, especially, to, females, with, calves, brown, bears, ursus, arctos, are, also, known, to, prey, on, moose, of, various, sizes, and, are, the, only, predator, besides, the, wolf, to, attack, moose, both, in, eurasia, and, north, america, in, western, russia, moose, provide, about, 15, annual, estimated, dietary, energy, content, for, brown, bears, and, are, the, most, important, food, source, for, these, predators, during, spring, however, brown, bears, are, more, likely, to, scavenge, a, wolf, kill, or, to, take, young, moose, than, to, hunt, adult, moose, on, their, own, black, bears, ursus, americanus, and, cougars, puma, concolor, can, be, significant, predators, of, moose, calves, in, may, and, june, and, can, in, rare, instances, prey, on, adults, mainly, cows, rather, than, the, larger, bulls, wolverines, gulo, gulo, are, most, likely, to, eat, moose, as, carrion, but, have, killed, moose, including, adults, when, the, large, ungulates, are, weakened, by, harsh, winter, conditions, orcas, orcinus, orca, are, the, moose, s, only, confirmed, marine, predator, as, they, have, been, known, to, prey, on, moose, and, other, deer, swimming, between, islands, out, of, north, america, s, northwest, coast, however, such, kills, are, rare, and, a, matter, of, opportunity, as, moose, are, not, a, regular, part, of, the, orca, diet, there, is, at, least, one, recorded, instance, of, a, moose, preyed, upon, by, a, greenland, shark, somniosus, microcephalus, in, some, areas, moose, are, the, primary, source, of, food, for, wolves, moose, usually, flee, upon, detecting, wolves, wolves, usually, follow, moose, at, a, distance, of, 100, to, 400, meters, 300, to, 1, 300, ft, occasionally, at, a, distance, of, two, to, three, kilometers, 1, to, 2, mi, attacks, from, wolves, against, young, moose, may, last, seconds, though, sometimes, they, can, be, drawn, out, for, days, with, adults, sometimes, wolves, will, chase, moose, into, shallow, streams, or, onto, frozen, rivers, where, their, mobility, is, greatly, impeded, moose, will, sometimes, stand, their, ground, and, defend, themselves, by, charging, at, the, wolves, or, lashing, out, at, them, with, their, powerful, hooves, wolves, typically, kill, moose, by, tearing, at, their, haunches, and, perineum, causing, massive, blood, loss, occasionally, a, wolf, may, immobilize, a, moose, by, biting, its, sensitive, nose, the, pain, of, which, can, paralyze, a, moose, wolf, packs, primarily, target, calves, and, elderly, animals, but, can, and, will, take, healthy, adult, moose, moose, between, the, ages, of, two, and, eight, are, seldom, killed, by, wolves, though, moose, are, usually, hunted, by, packs, there, are, cases, in, which, single, wolves, have, successfully, killed, healthy, fully, grown, moose, research, into, moose, predation, suggests, that, their, response, to, perceived, threats, is, learned, rather, than, instinctual, in, practical, terms, this, means, moose, are, more, vulnerable, in, areas, where, wolf, or, bear, populations, were, decimated, in, the, past, but, are, now, rebounding, these, same, studies, suggest, however, that, moose, learn, quickly, and, adapt, fleeing, an, area, if, they, hear, or, smell, wolves, bears, or, scavenger, birds, such, as, ravens, moose, are, also, subject, to, various, diseases, and, forms, of, parasitism, in, northern, europe, the, moose, botfly, is, a, parasite, whose, range, seems, to, be, spreading, moose, typically, carry, a, heavy, burden, of, parasites, both, externally, and, internally, parasitosis, is, an, important, cause, of, moose, morbidity, and, mortality, and, also, contributes, to, vulnerability, to, predators, ectoparasites, of, moose, include, the, moose, nose, bot, fly, and, winter, ticks, endoparasites, of, moose, include, dog, tapeworm, meningeal, worm, lungworm, and, roundworm, moose, are, mostly, diurnal, they, are, generally, solitary, with, the, strongest, bonds, between, mother, and, calf, although, moose, rarely, gather, in, groups, there, may, be, several, in, close, proximity, during, the, mating, season, rutting, and, mating, occurs, in, september, and, october, during, the, rut, mature, bulls, will, cease, feeding, completely, for, a, period, of, approximately, two, weeks, this, fasting, behavior, has, been, attributed, to, neurophysiological, changes, related, to, redeployment, of, olfaction, for, detection, of, moose, urine, and, moose, cows, the, males, are, polygynous, and, will, seek, several, females, to, breed, with, during, this, time, both, sexes, will, call, to, each, other, males, produce, heavy, grunting, sounds, that, can, be, heard, from, up, to, 500, metres, 1, 600, ft, away, while, females, produce, wail, like, sounds, males, will, fight, for, access, to, females, initially, the, males, assess, which, of, them, is, dominant, and, one, bull, may, retreat, however, the, interaction, can, escalate, to, a, fight, using, their, antlers, female, moose, have, an, eight, month, gestation, period, usually, bearing, one, calf, or, twins, if, food, is, plentiful, in, may, or, june, twinning, can, run, as, high, as, 30, to, 40, with, good, nutrition, newborn, moose, have, fur, with, a, reddish, hue, in, contrast, to, the, brown, appearance, of, an, adult, the, young, will, stay, with, the, mother, until, just, before, the, next, young, are, born, the, life, span, of, an, average, moose, is, about, 15, 25, years, moose, populations, are, stable, at, 25, calves, for, every, 100, cows, at, 1, year, of, age, with, availability, of, adequate, nutrition, mild, weather, and, low, predation, moose, have, a, huge, potential, for, population, expansion, moose, are, not, typically, aggressive, towards, humans, but, will, be, aggressive, when, provoked, or, frightened, moose, attack, more, people, than, bears, and, wolves, combined, but, usually, with, only, minor, consequences, in, the, americas, moose, injure, more, people, than, any, other, wild, mammal, worldwide, only, hippopotamuses, injure, more, when, harassed, or, startled, by, people, or, in, the, presence, of, a, dog, moose, may, charge, also, as, with, bears, or, most, wild, animals, moose, accustomed, to, being, fed, by, people, may, act, aggressively, when, denied, food, during, the, fall, mating, season, bulls, may, be, aggressive, toward, humans, cows, are, protective, of, young, calves, and, will, attack, humans, who, come, close, especially, if, they, come, between, mother, and, calf, moose, are, not, territorial, do, not, view, humans, as, food, and, usually, will, not, pursue, humans, who, run, away, moose, are, unpredictable, they, are, most, likely, to, attack, if, annoyed, or, harassed, or, if, approached, too, closely, a, moose, that, has, been, harassed, may, vent, its, anger, on, anyone, in, the, vicinity, and, they, often, do, not, make, distinctions, between, their, tormentors, and, innocent, passersby, moose, are, very, limber, animals, with, highly, flexible, joints, and, sharp, pointed, hooves, and, are, capable, of, kicking, with, both, front, and, back, legs, unlike, other, large, hoofed, mammals, such, as, horses, moose, can, kick, in, all, directions, including, sideways, thus, there, is, no, safe, side, from, which, to, approach, moose, often, give, warning, signs, prior, to, attacking, displaying, aggression, by, means, of, body, language, maintained, eye, contact, is, usually, the, first, sign, of, aggression, while, laid, back, ears, or, a, lowered, head, is, a, sign, of, agitation, when, the, hairs, on, the, back, of, the, moose, s, neck, and, shoulders, hackles, stand, up, a, charge, is, usually, imminent, the, anchorage, visitor, centers, warn, tourists, that, a, moose, with, its, hackles, raised, is, a, thing, to, fear, moose, cows, are, more, likely, to, emit, protest, moans, when, courted, by, small, males, this, attracts, the, attention, of, large, males, promotes, male, male, competition, and, violence, reduces, harassment, of, cows, by, small, males, and, increases, mating, opportunities, with, large, males, this, in, turn, means, that, the, cow, moose, has, at, least, a, small, degree, of, control, over, which, bulls, she, mates, with, moose, often, show, aggression, to, other, animals, as, well, especially, predators, bears, are, common, predators, of, moose, calves, and, rarely, adults, alaskan, moose, have, been, reported, to, successfully, fend, off, attacks, from, both, black, and, brown, bears, moose, have, been, known, to, stomp, attacking, wolves, which, makes, them, less, preferred, as, prey, to, the, wolves, moose, are, fully, capable, of, killing, bears, and, wolves, in, one, rare, event, a, female, moose, killed, two, adult, male, wolves, a, moose, of, either, sex, that, is, confronted, by, danger, may, let, out, a, loud, roar, more, resembling, that, of, a, predator, than, a, prey, animal, european, moose, are, often, more, aggressive, than, north, american, moose, such, as, the, moose, in, sweden, which, often, become, very, agitated, at, the, sight, of, a, predator, however, like, all, ungulates, known, to, attack, predators, the, more, aggressive, individuals, are, always, darker, in, color, with, the, darkest, coloring, usually, in, areas, facing, the, opponent, thus, serving, as, a, natural, warning, to, other, animals, moose, require, habitat, with, adequate, edible, plants, e, g, pond, grasses, young, trees, and, shrubs, cover, from, predators, and, protection, from, extremely, hot, or, cold, weather, moose, travel, among, different, habitats, with, the, seasons, to, address, these, requirements, moose, are, cold, adapted, mammals, with, thickened, skin, dense, heat, retaining, coat, and, a, low, surface, volume, ratio, which, provides, excellent, cold, tolerance, but, poor, heat, tolerance, moose, survive, hot, weather, by, accessing, shade, or, cooling, wind, or, by, immersion, in, cool, water, in, hot, weather, moose, are, often, found, wading, or, swimming, in, lakes, or, ponds, when, heat, stressed, moose, may, fail, to, adequately, forage, in, summer, and, may, not, gain, adequate, body, fat, to, survive, the, winter, also, moose, cows, may, not, calve, without, adequate, summer, weight, gain, moose, require, access, to, both, young, forest, for, browsing, and, mature, forest, for, shelter, and, cover, forest, disturbed, by, fire, and, logging, promotes, the, growth, of, fodder, for, moose, moose, also, require, access, to, mineral, licks, safe, places, for, calving, and, aquatic, feeding, sites, moose, avoid, areas, with, little, or, no, snow, as, this, increases, the, risk, of, predation, by, wolves, and, avoid, areas, with, deep, snow, as, this, impairs, mobility, thus, moose, select, habitat, on, the, basis, of, trade, offs, between, risk, of, predation, food, availability, and, snow, depth, with, reintroduction, of, bison, into, boreal, forest, there, was, some, concern, that, bison, would, compete, with, moose, for, winter, habitat, and, thereby, worsen, the, population, decline, of, moose, however, this, does, not, appear, to, be, a, problem, moose, prefer, sub, alpine, shrublands, in, early, winter, while, bison, prefer, wet, sedge, valley, meadowlands, in, early, winter, in, late, winter, moose, prefer, river, valleys, with, deciduous, forest, cover, or, alpine, terrain, above, the, tree, line, while, bison, preferred, wet, sedge, meadowlands, or, sunny, southern, grassy, slopes, after, expanding, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, the, moose, population, of, north, america, has, been, in, steep, decline, since, the, 1990s, populations, expanded, greatly, with, improved, habitat, and, protection, but, now, the, moose, population, is, declining, rapidly, this, decline, has, been, attributed, to, opening, of, roads, and, landscapes, into, the, northern, range, of, moose, allowing, deer, to, become, populous, in, areas, where, they, were, not, previously, common, this, encroachment, by, deer, on, moose, habitat, brought, moose, into, contact, with, previously, unfamiliar, pathogens, including, brainworm, and, liver, fluke, and, these, parasites, are, believed, to, have, contributed, to, the, population, decline, of, moose, in, north, america, the, moose, range, includes, almost, all, of, canada, excluding, the, arctic, and, vancouver, island, most, of, alaska, northern, and, eastern, north, dakota, northern, new, england, the, adirondack, mountain, region, and, taconic, highlands, of, northeast, new, york, state, the, upper, rocky, mountains, northern, minnesota, northern, wisconsin, michigan, s, upper, peninsula, and, isle, royale, in, lake, superior, this, massive, range, containing, diverse, habitats, contains, four, of, the, six, north, american, subspecies, in, the, west, moose, populations, extend, across, canada, british, columbia, and, alberta, isolated, groups, have, been, verified, as, far, south, as, the, mountains, of, utah, and, colorado, and, as, far, west, as, the, lake, wenatchee, area, of, the, washington, cascades, in, the, northwestern, us, the, range, includes, wyoming, montana, idaho, and, smaller, areas, of, washington, and, oregon, moose, have, extended, their, range, southwards, in, the, western, rocky, mountains, with, initial, sightings, in, yellowstone, national, park, in, 1868, and, then, to, the, northern, slope, of, the, uinta, mountains, in, utah, in, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, this, is, the, southernmost, naturally, established, moose, population, in, the, united, states, in, 1978, a, few, breeding, pairs, were, reintroduced, in, western, colorado, and, the, state, s, moose, population, is, now, more, than, 2, 400, in, northeastern, north, america, the, eastern, moose, s, history, is, very, well, documented, moose, meat, was, a, staple, in, the, diet, of, indigenous, peoples, for, centuries, the, common, name, moose, was, brought, into, english, from, the, word, used, by, those, who, lived, in, present, day, coastal, rhode, island, the, indigenous, people, often, used, moose, hides, for, leather, and, its, meat, as, an, ingredient, in, pemmican, a, type, of, dried, jerky, used, as, a, source, of, sustenance, in, winter, or, on, long, journeys, the, historical, range, of, the, subspecies, extended, from, well, into, quebec, the, maritimes, and, eastern, ontario, south, to, include, all, of, new, england, finally, ending, in, the, very, northeastern, tip, of, pennsylvania, in, the, west, cutting, off, somewhere, near, the, mouth, of, the, hudson, river, in, the, south, the, moose, has, been, extinct, in, much, of, the, eastern, u, s, for, as, long, as, 150, years, due, to, colonial, era, overhunting, and, destruction, of, its, habitat, dutch, french, and, british, colonial, sources, all, attest, to, its, presence, in, the, mid, 17th, century, from, maine, south, to, areas, within, 160, kilometers, 100, mi, of, present, day, manhattan, however, by, the, 1870s, only, a, handful, of, moose, existed, in, this, entire, region, in, very, remote, pockets, of, forest, less, than, 20, of, suitable, habitat, remained, since, the, 1980s, however, moose, populations, have, rebounded, thanks, to, regrowth, of, plentiful, food, sources, abandonment, of, farmland, better, land, management, clean, up, of, pollution, and, natural, dispersal, from, the, canadian, maritimes, and, quebec, south, of, the, canada, us, border, maine, has, most, of, the, population, with, a, 2012, headcount, of, about, 76, 000, moose, dispersals, from, maine, over, the, years, have, resulted, in, healthy, growing, populations, each, in, vermont, and, new, hampshire, notably, near, bodies, of, water, and, as, high, up, as, 910, m, 3, 000, ft, above, sea, level, in, the, mountains, in, massachusetts, moose, had, gone, extinct, by, 1870, but, re, colonized, the, state, in, the, 1960s, with, the, population, expanding, from, vermont, and, new, hampshire, by, 2010, the, population, was, estimated, at, 850, 950, moose, reestablished, populations, in, eastern, new, york, and, connecticut, and, appeared, headed, south, towards, the, catskill, mountains, a, former, habitat, in, the, midwest, u, s, moose, are, primarily, limited, to, the, upper, great, lakes, region, but, strays, primarily, immature, males, have, been, found, as, far, south, as, eastern, iowa, for, unknown, reasons, the, moose, population, is, declining, rapidly, in, the, midwest, moose, were, successfully, introduced, on, newfoundland, in, 1878, and, 1904, where, they, are, now, the, dominant, ungulate, and, somewhat, less, successfully, on, anticosti, island, in, the, gulf, of, saint, lawrence, since, the, 1990s, moose, populations, have, declined, dramatically, in, much, of, temperate, north, america, although, they, remain, stable, in, arctic, and, subarctic, regions, the, exact, causes, of, specific, die, offs, are, not, determined, but, most, documented, mortality, events, were, due, to, wolf, predation, bacterial, infection, due, to, injuries, sustained, from, predators, and, parasites, from, white, tailed, deer, to, which, moose, have, not, developed, a, natural, defense, such, as, liver, flukes, brain, worms, and, winter, tick, infestations, predation, of, moose, calves, by, brown, bear, is, also, significant, landscape, change, from, salvage, logging, of, forest, damage, caused, by, the, mountain, pine, beetle, has, resulted, in, greater, foraging, in, logged, areas, by, female, moose, and, this, is, the, lead, hypothesis, as, to, why, the, moose, population, is, declining, in, eastern, north, american, forests, as, this, likely, leads, to, increased, predation, an, alternate, hypotheses, among, biologists, for, generalized, nonhunting, declines, in, moose, populations, at, the, southern, extent, of, their, range, is, increasing, heat, stress, brought, on, by, the, rapid, seasonal, temperature, upswings, as, a, result, of, human, induced, climate, change, biologists, studying, moose, populations, typically, use, warm, season, heat, stress, thresholds, of, between, 14, and, 24, c, 57, and, 75, f, however, the, minor, average, temperature, increase, of, 0, 83, 1, 11, c, 1, 5, 2, f, over, the, last, 100, years, has, resulted, in, milder, winters, that, induce, favorable, conditions, for, ticks, parasites, and, other, invasive, species, to, flourish, within, the, southern, range, of, moose, habitat, in, north, america, the, moose, population, in, new, hampshire, fell, from, 7, 500, in, the, early, 2000s, to, a, 2014, estimate, of, 4, 000, and, in, vermont, the, numbers, were, down, to, 2, 200, from, a, high, of, 5, 000, animals, in, 2005, much, of, the, decline, has, been, attributed, to, the, winter, tick, which, between, 2017, and, 2019, accounted, for, 74, of, all, winter, mortality, and, 91, of, winter, calf, deaths, in, vermont, moose, with, heavy, tick, infections, will, rub, their, fur, down, to, the, skin, raw, trying, to, get, the, ticks, off, making, them, look, white, when, their, outer, coat, rubs, off, locals, call, them, ghost, moose, loss, of, the, insulating, winter, coat, through, attempts, to, rid, the, moose, of, winter, tick, increases, the, risk, of, hypothermia, in, winter, in, europe, moose, are, currently, found, in, large, numbers, throughout, norway, sweden, finland, latvia, estonia, poland, with, more, modest, numbers, in, the, southern, czech, republic, belarus, and, northern, ukraine, they, are, also, widespread, through, russia, on, up, through, the, borders, with, finland, south, towards, the, border, with, estonia, belarus, and, ukraine, and, stretching, far, away, eastwards, to, the, yenisei, river, in, siberia, the, european, moose, was, native, to, most, temperate, areas, with, suitable, habitat, on, the, continent, and, even, scotland, from, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, as, europe, had, a, mix, of, temperate, boreal, and, deciduous, forest, up, through, classical, times, the, species, was, certainly, thriving, in, both, gaul, and, magna, germania, as, it, appears, in, military, and, hunting, accounts, of, the, age, however, as, the, roman, era, faded, into, medieval, times, the, beast, slowly, disappeared, soon, after, the, reign, of, charlemagne, the, moose, disappeared, from, france, where, its, range, extended, from, normandy, in, the, north, to, the, pyrenees, in, the, south, farther, east, it, survived, in, alsace, and, the, netherlands, until, the, 9th, century, as, the, marshlands, in, the, latter, were, drained, and, the, forests, were, cleared, away, for, feudal, lands, in, the, former, it, was, gone, from, switzerland, by, the, year, 1000, from, the, western, czech, republic, by, 1300, from, mecklenburg, in, germany, by, c, 1600, and, from, hungary, and, the, caucasus, since, the, 18th, and, 19th, century, respectively, by, the, early, 20th, century, the, last, strongholds, of, the, european, moose, appeared, to, be, in, fennoscandian, areas, and, patchy, tracts, of, russia, with, a, few, migrants, found, in, what, is, now, estonia, and, lithuania, the, ussr, and, poland, managed, to, restore, portions, of, the, range, within, its, borders, such, as, the, 1951, reintroduction, into, kampinos, national, park, and, the, later, 1958, reintroduction, in, belarus, but, political, complications, limited, the, ability, to, reintroduce, it, to, other, portions, of, its, range, attempts, in, 1930, and, again, in, 1967, in, marshland, north, of, berlin, were, unsuccessful, at, present, in, poland, populations, are, recorded, in, the, biebrza, river, valley, kampinos, and, in, bia, owie, a, forest, it, has, migrated, into, other, parts, of, eastern, europe, and, has, been, spotted, in, eastern, and, southern, germany, unsuccessful, thus, far, in, recolonizing, these, areas, via, natural, dispersal, from, source, populations, in, poland, belarus, ukraine, czech, republic, and, slovakia, it, appears, to, be, having, more, success, migrating, south, into, the, caucasus, it, is, listed, under, appendix, iii, of, the, bern, convention, in, 2008, two, moose, were, reintroduced, into, the, scottish, highlands, in, alladale, wilderness, reserve, the, moose, disappeared, as, a, breeding, species, from, denmark, about, 4, 500, years, ago, in, the, last, century, a, very, small, number, have, lived, for, periods, in, zealand, without, establishing, a, population, after, swimming, across, the, resund, from, sweden, but, in, 2016, 17, ten, were, introduced, to, lille, vildmose, from, sweden, in, 2020, this, population, had, increased, to, about, 25, animals, the, east, asian, moose, populations, confine, themselves, mostly, to, the, territory, of, russia, with, much, smaller, populations, in, mongolia, and, northeastern, china, moose, populations, are, relatively, stable, in, siberia, and, increasing, on, the, kamchatka, peninsula, in, mongolia, and, china, where, poaching, took, a, great, toll, on, moose, forcing, them, to, near, extinction, they, are, protected, but, enforcement, of, the, policy, is, weak, and, demand, for, traditional, medicines, derived, from, deer, parts, is, high, in, 1978, the, regional, hunting, department, transported, 45, young, moose, to, the, center, of, kamchatka, these, moose, were, brought, from, chukotka, home, to, the, largest, moose, on, the, planet, kamchatka, now, regularly, is, responsible, for, the, largest, trophy, moose, shot, around, the, world, each, season, as, it, is, a, fertile, environment, for, moose, with, a, milder, climate, less, snow, and, an, abundance, of, food, moose, quickly, bred, and, settled, along, the, valley, of, the, kamchatka, river, and, many, surrounding, regions, the, population, in, the, past, 20, years, has, risen, to, over, 2, 900, animals, the, size, of, the, moose, varies, following, bergmann, s, rule, population, in, the, south, a, a, cameloides, usually, grow, smaller, while, moose, in, the, north, and, northeast, a, a, buturlini, can, match, the, imposing, sizes, of, the, alaskan, moose, a, a, gigas, and, are, prized, by, trophy, hunters, in, 1900, an, attempt, to, introduce, moose, into, the, hokitika, area, failed, then, in, 1910, ten, moose, four, bulls, and, six, cows, were, introduced, into, fiordland, this, area, is, considered, a, less, than, suitable, habitat, and, subsequent, low, numbers, of, sightings, and, kills, have, led, to, some, presumption, of, this, population, s, failure, the, last, proven, sighting, of, a, moose, in, new, zealand, was, in, 1952, however, a, moose, antler, was, found, in, 1972, and, dna, tests, showed, that, hair, collected, in, 2002, was, from, a, moose, there, has, been, extensive, searching, and, while, automated, cameras, failed, to, capture, photographs, evidence, was, seen, of, bedding, spots, browsing, and, antler, marks, moose, are, members, of, the, subfamily, capreolinae, members, of, the, moose, lineage, extend, back, into, the, pliocene, early, pleistocene, some, scientists, group, the, moose, and, all, its, extinct, relatives, into, one, genus, alces, while, others, such, as, augusto, azzaroli, restrict, alces, to, the, living, species, placing, the, fossil, species, into, the, genera, cervalces, stag, moose, and, libralces, the, earliest, known, species, in, the, moose, lineage, is, libralces, gallicus, which, lived, in, the, pliocene, early, pleistocene, libralces, gallicus, came, from, the, warm, savannas, of, pliocene, europe, with, the, best, preserved, skeletons, being, found, in, southern, france, l, gallicus, was, 1, 25, times, larger, than, the, alaskan, moose, in, linear, dimensions, making, it, nearly, twice, as, massive, l, gallicus, had, many, striking, differences, from, its, modern, descendants, it, had, a, longer, narrower, snout, and, a, less, developed, nasal, cavity, more, resembling, that, of, a, modern, deer, lacking, any, sign, of, the, modern, moose, snout, its, face, resembled, that, of, the, modern, wapiti, however, the, rest, of, its, skull, structure, skeletal, structure, and, teeth, bore, strong, resemblance, to, those, features, that, are, unmistakable, in, modern, moose, indicating, a, similar, diet, its, antlers, consisted, of, a, horizontal, bar, 2, 5, m, 8, ft, 2, in, long, with, no, tines, ending, in, small, palmations, its, skull, and, neck, structure, suggest, an, animal, that, fought, using, high, speed, impacts, much, like, the, dall, sheep, rather, than, locking, and, twisting, antlers, the, way, modern, moose, combat, their, long, legs, and, bone, structure, suggest, an, animal, that, was, adapted, to, running, at, high, speeds, over, rough, terrain, libralces, gallicus, was, followed, by, cervalces, carnutorum, during, the, first, half, of, the, early, pleistocene, cervalces, carnutorum, was, soon, followed, by, a, much, larger, species, called, cervalces, latifrons, broad, fronted, stag, moose, which, first, appeared, during, the, late, early, pleistocene, many, fossils, of, cervalces, latifrons, have, been, found, across, eurasia, like, its, descendants, it, inhabited, mostly, northern, latitudes, and, was, probably, well, adapted, to, the, cold, c, latifrons, was, the, largest, deer, known, to, have, ever, existed, standing, more, than, 2, 1, m, 6, ft, 11, in, tall, at, the, shoulders, this, is, bigger, than, even, the, irish, elk, which, was, 1, 8, m, 5, ft, 11, in, tall, at, the, shoulders, its, antlers, were, smaller, than, the, irish, elk, s, but, comparable, in, size, to, those, of, l, gallicus, however, the, antlers, had, a, shorter, horizontal, bar, and, larger, palmations, more, resembling, those, of, a, modern, moose, probably, sometime, in, the, middle, pleistocene, cervalces, latifrons, migrated, into, north, america, giving, rise, to, the, stag, moose, cervalces, scotti, the, modern, moose, is, thought, to, have, evolved, from, cervalces, latifrons, at, around, the, end, of, the, middle, pleistocene, to, the, beginning, of, the, late, pleistocene, probably, somewhere, in, east, asia, with, the, earliest, fossils, of, the, species, in, europe, dating, to, the, early, late, pleistocene, the, modern, moose, only, arrived, in, north, america, around, 15, 000, years, ago, at, the, end, of, the, late, pleistocene, north, america, europe, and, asia, european, rock, drawings, and, cave, paintings, reveal, that, moose, have, been, hunted, since, the, stone, age, excavations, in, alby, sweden, adjacent, to, the, stora, alvaret, have, yielded, moose, antlers, in, wooden, hut, remains, from, 6000, bce, indicating, some, of, the, earliest, moose, hunting, in, northern, europe, in, northern, scandinavia, one, can, still, find, remains, of, trapping, pits, used, for, hunting, moose, these, pits, which, can, be, up, to, 4, m, 7, m, 13, ft, 23, ft, in, area, and, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, deep, would, have, been, camouflaged, with, branches, and, leaves, they, would, have, had, steep, sides, lined, with, planks, making, it, impossible, for, the, moose, to, escape, once, it, fell, in, the, pits, are, normally, found, in, large, groups, crossing, the, moose, s, regular, paths, and, stretching, over, several, km, remains, of, wooden, fences, designed, to, guide, the, animals, toward, the, pits, have, been, found, in, bogs, and, peat, in, norway, an, early, example, of, these, trapping, devices, has, been, dated, to, around, 3700, bc, trapping, elk, in, pits, is, an, extremely, effective, hunting, method, as, early, as, the, 16th, century, the, norwegian, government, tried, to, restrict, their, use, nevertheless, the, method, was, in, use, until, the, 19th, century, the, earliest, recorded, description, of, the, moose, is, in, julius, caesar, s, commentarii, de, bello, gallico, where, it, is, described, thus, there, are, also, which, are, called, alces, moose, the, shape, of, these, and, the, varied, color, of, their, skins, is, much, like, roes, but, in, size, they, surpass, them, a, little, and, are, destitute, of, horns, and, have, legs, without, joints, and, ligatures, nor, do, they, lie, down, for, the, purpose, of, rest, nor, if, they, have, been, thrown, down, by, any, accident, can, they, raise, or, lift, themselves, up, trees, serve, as, beds, to, them, they, lean, themselves, against, them, and, thus, reclining, only, slightly, they, take, their, rest, when, the, huntsmen, have, discovered, from, the, footsteps, of, these, animals, whither, they, are, accustomed, to, betake, themselves, they, either, undermine, all, the, trees, at, the, roots, or, cut, into, them, so, far, that, the, upper, part, of, the, trees, may, appear, to, be, left, standing, when, they, have, leant, upon, them, according, to, their, habit, they, knock, down, by, their, weight, the, unsupported, trees, and, fall, down, themselves, along, with, them, in, book, 8, chapter, 16, of, pliny, the, elder, s, natural, history, from, 77, ce, the, elk, and, an, animal, called, achlis, which, is, presumably, the, same, animal, are, described, thus, there, is, also, the, moose, which, strongly, resembles, our, steers, except, that, it, is, distinguished, by, the, length, of, the, ears, and, of, the, neck, there, is, also, the, achlis, which, is, produced, in, the, land, of, scandinavia, it, has, never, been, seen, in, this, city, although, we, have, had, descriptions, of, it, from, many, persons, it, is, not, unlike, the, moose, but, has, no, joints, in, the, hind, leg, hence, it, never, lies, down, but, reclines, against, a, tree, while, it, sleeps, it, can, only, be, taken, by, previously, cutting, into, the, tree, and, thus, laying, a, trap, for, it, as, otherwise, it, would, escape, through, its, swiftness, its, upper, lip, is, so, extremely, large, for, which, reason, it, is, obliged, to, go, backwards, when, grazing, otherwise, by, moving, onwards, the, lip, would, get, doubled, up, moose, are, hunted, as, a, game, species, in, many, of, the, countries, where, they, are, found, moose, meat, tastes, wrote, henry, david, thoreau, in, the, maine, woods, like, tender, beef, with, perhaps, more, flavour, sometimes, like, veal, while, the, flesh, has, protein, levels, similar, to, those, of, other, comparable, red, meats, e, g, beef, deer, and, wapiti, it, has, a, low, fat, content, and, the, fat, that, is, present, consists, of, a, higher, proportion, of, polyunsaturated, fats, than, saturated, fats, dr, valerius, geist, who, emigrated, to, canada, from, the, soviet, union, wrote, in, his, 1999, book, moose, behaviour, ecology, conservation, in, sweden, no, fall, menu, is, without, a, mouthwatering, moose, dish, the, swedes, fence, their, highways, to, reduce, moose, fatalities, and, design, moose, proof, cars, sweden, is, less, than, half, as, large, as, the, canadian, province,

alaska, for, hunting, purposes, is, one, of, the, reasons, given, for, allowing, aerial, or, airborne, methods, to, remove, wolves, in, designated, areas, e, g, craig, medred, a, kill, of, 124, wolves, would, thus, translate, to, 1488, moose, or, 2976, caribou, or, some, combination, thereof, some, scientists, believe, that, this, artificial, inflation, of, game, populations, is, actually, detrimental, to, both, caribou, and, moose, populations, as, well, as, the, ecosystem, as, a, whole, this, is, because, studies, have, shown, that, when, these, game, populations, are, artificially, boosted, it, leads, to, both, habitat, destruction, and, a, crash, in, these, populations, cadmium, levels, are, high, in, finnish, moose, liver, and, kidneys, with, the, result, that, consumption, of, these, organs, from, moose, more, than, one, year, old, is, prohibited, in, finland, as, a, result, of, a, study, reported, in, 1988, the, ontario, ministry, of, natural, resources, recommended, against, the, consumption, of, moose, and, deer, kidneys, and, livers, levels, of, cadmium, were, found, to, be, considerably, higher, than, in, scandinavia, the, new, brunswick, department, of, natural, resources, advises, hunters, not, to, consume, cervid, offal, cadmium, intake, has, been, found, to, be, elevated, amongst, all, consumers, of, moose, meat, though, the, meat, was, found, to, contribute, only, slightly, to, the, daily, cadmium, intake, however, the, consumption, of, moose, liver, or, kidneys, significantly, increased, cadmium, intake, with, the, study, revealing, that, heavy, consumers, of, moose, organs, have, a, relatively, narrow, safety, margin, below, the, levels, which, would, probably, cause, adverse, health, effects, the, center, of, mass, of, a, moose, is, above, the, hood, of, most, passenger, cars, in, a, collision, the, impact, crushes, the, front, roof, beams, and, individuals, in, the, front, seats, collisions, of, this, type, are, frequently, fatal, seat, belts, and, airbags, offer, little, protection, in, collisions, with, higher, vehicles, such, as, trucks, most, of, the, deformation, is, to, the, front, of, the, vehicle, and, the, passenger, compartment, is, largely, spared, moose, collisions, have, prompted, the, development, of, a, vehicle, test, referred, to, as, the, moose, test, swedish, lgtest, german, elchtest, a, massachusetts, study, found, that, moose, vehicular, collisions, had, a, very, high, human, fatality, rate, and, that, such, collisions, caused, the, death, of, 3, of, the, massachusetts, moose, population, annually, moose, warning, signs, are, used, on, roads, in, regions, where, there, is, a, danger, of, collision, with, the, animal, the, triangular, warning, signs, common, in, sweden, norway, and, finland, have, become, coveted, souvenirs, among, tourists, traveling, in, these, countries, causing, road, authorities, so, much, expense, that, the, moose, signs, have, been, replaced, with, imageless, generic, warning, signs, in, some, regions, in, ontario, canada, an, estimated, 265, moose, die, each, year, as, a, result, of, collision, with, trains, moose, train, collisions, were, more, frequent, in, winters, with, above, average, snowfall, in, january, 2008, the, norwegian, newspaper, aftenposten, estimated, that, some, 13, 000, moose, had, died, in, collisions, with, norwegian, trains, since, 2000, the, state, agency, in, charge, of, railroad, infrastructure, jernbaneverket, plans, to, spend, 80, million, norwegian, kroner, to, reduce, collision, rate, in, the, future, by, fencing, the, railways, clearing, vegetation, from, near, the, tracks, and, providing, alternative, snow, free, feeding, places, for, the, animals, elsewhere, in, the, canadian, province, of, new, brunswick, collisions, between, automobiles, and, moose, are, frequent, enough, that, all, new, highways, have, fences, to, prevent, moose, from, accessing, the, road, as, has, long, been, done, in, finland, norway, and, sweden, a, demonstration, project, highway, 7, between, fredericton, and, saint, john, which, has, one, of, the, highest, frequencies, of, moose, collisions, in, the, province, did, not, have, these, fences, until, 2008, although, it, was, and, continues, to, be, extremely, well, signed, newfoundland, and, labrador, recommended, that, motorists, use, caution, between, dusk, and, dawn, because, that, is, when, moose, are, most, active, and, most, difficult, to, see, increasing, the, risk, of, collisions, local, moose, sightings, are, often, reported, on, radio, stations, so, that, motorists, can, take, care, while, driving, in, particular, areas, an, electronic, moose, detection, system, was, installed, on, two, sections, of, the, trans, canada, highway, in, newfoundland, in, 2011, but, the, system, proved, unreliable, and, was, removed, in, 2015, in, sweden, a, road, will, not, be, fenced, unless, it, experiences, at, least, one, moose, accident, per, km, per, year, in, eastern, germany, where, the, scarce, population, is, slowly, increasing, there, were, two, road, accidents, involving, moose, since, 2000, domestication, of, moose, was, investigated, in, the, soviet, union, before, world, war, ii, early, experiments, were, inconclusive, but, with, the, creation, of, a, moose, farm, at, pechora, ilych, nature, reserve, in, 1949, a, small, scale, moose, domestication, program, was, started, involving, attempts, at, selective, breeding, of, animals, on, the, basis, of, their, behavioural, characteristics, since, 1963, the, program, has, continued, at, kostroma, moose, farm, which, had, a, herd, of, 33, tame, moose, as, of, 2003, although, at, this, stage, the, farm, is, not, expected, to, be, a, profit, making, enterprise, it, obtains, some, income, from, the, sale, of, moose, milk, and, from, visiting, tourist, groups, its, main, value, however, is, seen, in, the, opportunities, it, offers, for, the, research, in, the, physiology, and, behavior, of, the, moose, as, well, as, in, the, insights, it, provides, into, the, general, principles, of, animal, domestication, in, sweden, there, was, a, debate, in, the, late, 18th, century, about, the, national, value, of, using, the, moose, as, a, domestic, animal, among, other, things, the, moose, was, proposed, to, be, used, in, postal, distribution, and, there, was, a, suggestion, to, develop, a, moose, mounted, cavalry, such, proposals, remained, unimplemented, mainly, because, the, extensive, hunting, for, moose, that, was, deregulated, in, the, 1790s, nearly, drove, it, to, extinction, while, there, have, been, documented, cases, of, individual, moose, being, used, for, riding, and, or, pulling, carts, and, sleds, bj,

newfoundland, and, labrador, and, ontario, moose, is, also, a, common, coat, of, arms, in, europe, as, well, for, example, in, finland, it, appears, on, the, coats, of, arms, of, hirvensalmi, and, m,
