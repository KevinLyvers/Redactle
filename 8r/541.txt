the, ocean, sunfish, or, common, mola, mola, mola, is, one, of, the, largest, bony, fish, in, the, world, it, is, the, type, species, of, the, genus, mola, and, one, of, five, extant, species, in, the, family, molidae, it, was, once, misidentified, as, the, heaviest, bony, fish, which, was, actually, a, different, and, closely, related, species, of, sunfish, mola, alexandrini, adults, typically, weigh, between, 247, and, 1, 000, kg, 545, and, 2, 205, lb, it, is, native, to, tropical, and, temperate, waters, around, the, world, it, resembles, a, fish, head, without, a, tail, and, its, main, body, is, flattened, laterally, sunfish, can, be, as, tall, as, they, are, long, when, their, dorsal, and, ventral, fins, are, extended, many, areas, of, sunfish, biology, remain, poorly, understood, and, various, research, efforts, are, underway, including, aerial, surveys, of, populations, satellite, surveillance, using, pop, off, satellite, tags, genetic, analysis, of, tissue, samples, and, collection, of, amateur, sighting, data, adult, sunfish, are, vulnerable, to, few, natural, predators, but, sea, lions, killer, whales, and, sharks, will, consume, them, sunfish, are, considered, a, delicacy, in, some, parts, of, the, world, including, japan, korea, and, taiwan, in, the, european, union, regulations, ban, the, sale, of, fish, and, fishery, products, derived, from, the, family, molidae, sunfish, are, frequently, caught, in, gillnets, its, common, english, name, sunfish, refers, to, the, animal, s, habit, of, sunbathing, at, the, surface, of, the, sea, its, common, names, in, dutch, portuguese, french, spanish, catalan, italian, russian, greek, hungarian, norwegian, and, german, maanvis, peixe, lua, poisson, lune, pez, luna, peix, lluna, pesce, luna, holdhal, m, nefisk, and, mondfisch, respectively, mean, moon, fish, in, reference, to, its, rounded, shape, in, german, the, fish, is, also, known, as, schwimmender, kopf, or, swimming, head, in, polish, it, is, named, samog, w, meaning, head, alone, or, only, head, because, it, has, no, true, tail, in, swedish, and, danish, it, is, known, as, klumpfisk, in, dutch, klompvis, in, finnish, m, hk, kala, all, of, which, mean, lump, fish, the, chinese, translation, of, its, academic, name, is, f, n, ch, y, meaning, toppled, wheel, fish, many, of, the, sunfish, s, various, names, allude, to, its, flattened, shape, it, was, originally, classified, in, the, pufferfish, family, as, tetraodon, mola, its, epithet, mola, is, latin, for, millstone, which, the, fish, resembles, because, of, its, gray, color, rough, texture, and, rounded, body, it, is, now, placed, in, its, own, genus, mola, and, family, name, molidae, as, the, type, species, with, two, other, species, mola, tecta, and, m, alexandrini, previously, known, as, mola, ramsayi, extinct, relatives, of, mola, mola, lived, in, the, oligocene, and, miocene, epochs, however, the, earliest, known, fossil, remains, of, mola, mola, itself, were, found, in, archaeological, middens, dating, to, the, holocene, epoch, the, common, name, sunfish, without, qualifier, is, used, to, describe, the, marine, family, molidae, and, the, freshwater, sunfish, in, the, family, centrarchidae, which, is, unrelated, to, molidae, on, the, other, hand, the, name, ocean, sunfish, and, mola, refer, only, to, the, family, molidae, it, shares, many, traits, common, to, members, in, the, order, tetraodontiformes, including, pufferfish, porcupinefish, and, filefish, like, having, a, beak, formed, from, four, fused, teeth, sunfish, fry, resemble, spiky, pufferfish, more, than, they, resemble, adult, molas, the, caudal, fin, of, the, ocean, sunfish, is, replaced, by, a, rounded, clavus, creating, the, body, s, distinct, truncated, shape, the, body, is, flattened, laterally, giving, it, a, long, oval, shape, when, seen, head, on, the, pectoral, fins, are, small, and, fan, shaped, while, the, dorsal, fin, and, the, anal, fin, are, lengthened, often, making, the, fish, as, tall, as, it, is, long, specimens, up, to, 3, 3, m, 10, ft, 10, in, in, height, have, been, recorded, the, mature, ocean, sunfish, has, an, average, length, of, 1, 8, m, 5, ft, 11, in, and, a, fin, to, fin, length, of, 2, 5, m, 8, ft, 2, in, the, weight, of, mature, specimens, can, range, from, 247, to, 1, 000, kg, 545, to, 2, 205, lb, but, even, larger, individuals, are, not, unheard, of, the, maximum, size, recorded, is, 3, 3, m, 10, ft, 10, in, in, length, and, maximum, weight, recorded, is, 2, 300, kg, 5, 100, lb, the, spinal, column, of, m, mola, contains, fewer, vertebrae, and, is, shorter, in, relation, to, the, body, than, that, of, any, other, fish, although, the, sunfish, descended, from, bony, ancestors, its, skeleton, contains, largely, cartilaginous, tissues, which, are, lighter, than, bone, allowing, it, to, grow, to, sizes, impractical, for, other, bony, fishes, its, teeth, are, fused, into, a, beak, like, structure, which, prevents, them, from, being, able, to, fully, close, their, mouths, while, also, having, pharyngeal, teeth, located, in, the, throat, the, sunfish, lacks, a, swim, bladder, some, sources, indicate, the, internal, organs, contain, a, concentrated, neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin, like, the, organs, of, other, poisonous, tetraodontiformes, while, others, dispute, this, claim, in, the, course, of, its, evolution, the, caudal, fin, tail, of, the, sunfish, disappeared, to, be, replaced, by, a, lumpy, pseudotail, the, clavus, this, structure, is, formed, by, the, convergence, of, the, dorsal, and, anal, fins, and, is, used, by, the, fish, as, a, rudder, the, smooth, denticled, clavus, retains, 11, 14, fin, rays, and, terminates, in, a, number, of, rounded, ossicles, ocean, sunfish, often, swim, near, the, surface, and, their, protruding, dorsal, fins, are, sometimes, mistaken, for, those, of, sharks, however, the, two, can, be, distinguished, by, the, motion, of, the, fin, unlike, most, fish, the, sunfish, swings, its, dorsal, fin, and, anal, fin, in, a, characteristic, sculling, motion, adult, sunfish, range, from, brown, to, silvery, grey, or, white, with, a, variety, of, region, specific, mottled, skin, patterns, coloration, is, often, darker, on, the, dorsal, surface, fading, to, a, lighter, shade, ventrally, as, a, form, of, countershading, camouflage, m, mola, also, exhibits, the, ability, to, vary, skin, coloration, from, light, to, dark, especially, when, under, attack, the, skin, which, contains, large, amounts, of, reticulated, collagen, can, be, up, to, 7, 3, cm, 2, 3, 4, in, thick, on, the, ventral, surface, and, is, covered, by, denticles, and, a, layer, of, mucus, instead, of, scales, the, skin, on, the, clavus, is, smoother, than, that, on, the, body, where, it, can, be, as, rough, as, sandpaper, more, than, 40, species, of, parasites, may, reside, on, the, skin, and, internally, motivating, the, fish, to, seek, relief, in, a, number, of, ways, one, of, the, most, frequent, ocean, sunfish, parasites, is, the, flatworm, accacoelium, contortum, in, temperate, regions, drifting, kelp, fields, harbor, cleaner, wrasses, and, other, fish, which, remove, parasites, from, the, skin, of, visiting, sunfish, in, the, tropics, m, mola, solicits, cleaning, help, from, reef, fishes, by, basking, on, its, side, at, the, surface, the, sunfish, also, allows, seabirds, to, feed, on, parasites, from, its, skin, sunfish, have, been, reported, to, breach, clearing, the, surface, by, approximately, 3, m, 10, ft, in, an, apparent, effort, to, dislodge, embedded, parasites, ocean, sunfish, are, native, to, the, temperate, and, tropical, waters, of, every, ocean, in, the, world, mola, genotypes, appear, to, vary, widely, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, but, genetic, differences, between, individuals, in, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, are, minimal, although, early, research, suggested, sunfish, moved, around, mainly, by, drifting, with, ocean, currents, which, has, resulted, in, the, sunfish, sometimes, being, characterized, as, a, megaplankton, individuals, have, been, recorded, swimming, 26, km, 16, mi, in, a, day, at, a, cruising, speed, of, 3, 2, km, h, 1, 7, kn, while, this, might, be, the, case, most, of, the, time, they, are, also, capable, of, moving, rapidly, when, feeding, or, avoiding, predators, to, the, extent, that, they, can, vertically, leap, out, of, water, contrary, to, the, perception, that, sunfish, spend, much, of, their, time, basking, at, the, surface, m, mola, adults, actually, spend, a, large, portion, of, their, lives, actively, hunting, at, depths, greater, than, 200, m, 660, ft, occupying, both, the, epipelagic, and, mesopelagic, zones, sunfish, are, most, often, found, in, water, warmer, than, 10, c, 50, f, prolonged, periods, spent, in, water, at, temperatures, of, 12, c, 54, f, or, lower, can, lead, to, disorientation, and, eventual, death, surface, basking, behavior, in, which, a, sunfish, swims, on, its, side, presenting, its, largest, profile, to, the, sun, may, be, a, method, of, thermally, recharging, following, dives, into, deeper, colder, water, in, order, to, feed, sightings, of, the, fish, in, colder, waters, outside, of, its, usual, habitat, such, as, those, southwest, of, england, may, be, evidence, of, increasing, marine, temperatures, sunfish, are, usually, found, alone, but, occasionally, in, pairs, the, diet, of, the, ocean, sunfish, was, formerly, thought, to, consist, primarily, of, various, jellyfish, however, genetic, analysis, reveals, that, sunfish, are, actually, generalist, predators, that, consume, mostly, small, fish, fish, larvae, squid, and, crustaceans, with, jellyfish, and, salps, making, up, only, around, 15, of, the, diet, occasionally, they, will, ingest, eel, grass, this, range, of, food, items, indicates, that, the, sunfish, feeds, at, many, levels, from, the, surface, to, deep, water, and, occasionally, down, to, the, seafloor, in, some, areas, ocean, sunfish, may, live, up, to, ten, years, in, captivity, but, their, lifespan, in, a, natural, habitat, has, not, yet, been, determined, their, growth, rate, remains, undetermined, however, a, young, specimen, at, the, monterey, bay, aquarium, increased, in, weight, from, 26, to, 399, kg, 57, to, 880, lb, and, reached, a, height, of, nearly, 1, 8, m, 5, ft, 11, in, in, 15, months, the, sheer, size, and, thick, skin, of, an, adult, of, the, species, deters, many, smaller, predators, but, younger, fish, are, vulnerable, to, predation, by, bluefin, tuna, and, mahi, mahi, adults, are, consumed, by, orca, sharks, and, sea, lions, the, mating, practices, of, the, ocean, sunfish, are, poorly, understood, but, spawning, areas, have, been, suggested, in, the, north, atlantic, south, atlantic, north, pacific, south, pacific, and, indian, oceans, females, of, the, species, can, produce, more, eggs, than, any, other, known, vertebrate, up, to, 300, million, at, a, time, sunfish, fry, do, not, have, the, large, pectoral, fins, and, tail, fin, of, their, adult, forms, but, they, have, body, spines, uncharacteristic, of, adult, sunfish, that, disappear, as, they, grow, females, are, estimated, to, be, carrying, as, many, as, 300, million, eggs, at, one, time, more, than, any, other, known, vertebrate, sunfish, eggs, are, released, into, the, water, and, externally, fertilized, by, sperm, newly, hatched, sunfish, larvae, are, only, 2, 5, mm, 3, 32, in, long, and, weigh, less, than, one, gram, they, develop, into, fry, that, resemble, miniature, pufferfish, their, close, relatives, young, sunfish, school, for, protection, but, this, behavior, is, abandoned, as, they, grow, the, fry, that, survive, can, grow, up, to, 60, million, times, their, original, weight, before, reaching, adult, proportions, arguably, the, most, extreme, size, growth, of, any, vertebrate, animal, in, 2016, researchers, from, china, national, genebank, and, a, star, singapore, including, nobel, laureate, sydney, brenner, sequenced, the, genome, of, the, ocean, sunfish, and, discovered, several, genes, which, might, explain, its, fast, growth, rate, and, large, body, size, as, member, of, the, order, tetraodontiformes, like, fugu, the, sunfish, has, quite, a, compact, genome, at, 730, mb, in, size, analysis, from, this, data, suggests, that, sunfish, and, pufferfishes, diverged, approximately, 68, million, years, ago, which, corroborates, the, results, of, other, recent, studies, based, on, smaller, datasets, despite, their, size, ocean, sunfish, are, docile, and, pose, no, threat, to, human, divers, injuries, from, sunfish, are, rare, although, a, slight, danger, exists, from, large, sunfish, leaping, out, of, the, water, onto, boats, in, 2005, a, 1, metre, 3, feet, 3, inches, long, sunfish, landed, on, a, 4, year, old, boy, when, the, fish, leaped, onto, the, boy, s, family, s, boat, off, the, coast, of, pembrokeshire, wales, areas, where, they, are, commonly, found, are, popular, destinations, for, sport, dives, and, sunfish, at, some, locations, have, reportedly, become, familiar, with, divers, they, are, more, of, a, problem, to, boaters, than, to, swimmers, as, they, can, pose, a, hazard, to, watercraft, due, to, their, large, size, and, weight, collisions, with, sunfish, are, common, in, some, parts, of, the, world, and, can, cause, damage, to, the, hull, of, a, boat, or, to, the, propellers, of, larger, ships, as, well, as, to, the, fish, the, flesh, of, the, ocean, sunfish, is, considered, a, delicacy, in, some, regions, the, largest, markets, being, taiwan, and, japan, all, parts, of, the, sunfish, are, used, in, cuisine, from, the, fins, to, the, internal, organs, some, parts, are, used, in, some, areas, of, traditional, medicine, fishery, products, derived, from, sunfish, are, forbidden, in, the, european, union, according, to, regulation, ec, no, 853, 2004, of, the, european, parliament, and, of, the, council, as, they, contain, toxins, that, are, harmful, to, human, health, sunfish, are, accidentally, but, frequently, caught, in, drift, gillnet, fisheries, making, up, nearly, 30, of, the, total, catch, of, the, swordfish, fishery, employing, drift, gillnets, in, california, the, bycatch, rate, is, even, higher, for, the, mediterranean, swordfish, industry, with, 71, to, 90, of, the, total, catch, being, sunfish, a, decrease, in, sunfish, populations, may, be, caused, by, more, frequent, bycatch, and, the, increasing, popularity, of, sunfish, in, human, diet, the, fishery, bycatch, and, destruction, of, ocean, sunfish, are, unregulated, worldwide, in, some, areas, the, fish, are, finned, by, fishermen, who, regard, them, as, worthless, bait, thieves, this, process, in, which, the, fins, are, cut, off, results, in, the, eventual, death, of, the, fish, because, it, can, no, longer, propel, itself, without, its, dorsal, and, anal, fins, the, species, is, also, threatened, by, floating, litter, such, as, plastic, bags, which, resemble, jellyfish, a, common, prey, item, bags, can, choke, and, suffocate, a, fish, or, fill, its, stomach, to, the, extent, that, it, starves, patterns, of, this, fish, known, as, kebuku, are, seen, in, sarongs, worn, by, women, in, lamalera, a, village, in, the, island, of, lembata, in, the, lesser, sunda, islands, of, indonesia, sunfish, are, not, widely, held, in, aquarium, exhibits, due, to, the, unique, and, demanding, requirements, of, their, care, some, asian, aquaria, display, them, particularly, in, japan, the, kaiyukan, aquarium, in, osaka, is, one, of, few, aquaria, with, mola, mola, on, display, where, it, is, reportedly, as, popular, an, attraction, as, the, larger, whale, sharks, the, lisbon, oceanarium, in, portugal, has, ocean, sunfish, showcased, in, the, main, tank, and, sunfish, are, also, on, display, at, the, denmark, nords, en, oceanarium, in, kamogawa, sea, world, the, ocean, sunfish, named, kukey, who, started, captivity, in, 1982, set, a, world, record, for, captivity, for, 2, 993, days, living, for, eight, years, kukey, was, 72, cm, 2, 36, ft, at, the, time, of, delivery, but, was, 187, cm, 6, 14, ft, in, size, at, the, time, of, death, while, the, first, ocean, sunfish, to, be, held, in, an, aquarium, in, the, united, states, is, said, to, have, arrived, at, the, monterey, bay, aquarium, in, august, 1986, other, specimens, have, previously, been, held, at, other, locations, marineland, of, the, pacific, closed, since, 1987, and, located, on, the, palos, verdes, peninsula, in, los, angeles, county, california, held, at, least, one, ocean, sunfish, by, 1961, and, in, 1964, held, a, 290, kilogram, 650, lb, specimen, said, to, be, the, largest, ever, captured, at, that, time, however, another, 450, kilogram, 1, 000, lb, specimen, was, brought, alive, to, marineland, studios, aquarium, near, st, augustine, florida, in, 1941, because, sunfish, had, not, been, kept, in, captivity, on, a, large, scale, before, the, staff, at, monterey, bay, was, forced, to, innovate, and, create, their, own, methods, for, capture, feeding, and, parasite, control, by, 1998, these, issues, were, overcome, and, the, aquarium, was, able, to, hold, a, specimen, for, more, than, a, year, later, releasing, it, after, its, weight, increased, by, more, than, 14, times, mola, mola, has, since, become, a, permanent, feature, of, the, open, sea, exhibit, monterey, bay, aquarium, s, largest, sunfish, specimen, was, euthanized, on, february, 14, 2008, after, an, extended, period, of, poor, health, a, major, concern, to, curators, is, preventive, measures, taken, to, keep, specimens, in, captivity, from, injuring, themselves, by, rubbing, against, the, walls, of, a, tank, since, ocean, sunfish, cannot, easily, maneuver, their, bodies, in, a, smaller, tank, hanging, a, vinyl, curtain, has, been, used, as, a, stopgap, measure, to, convert, a, cuboid, tank, to, a, rounded, shape, and, prevent, the, fish, from, scraping, against, the, sides, a, more, effective, solution, is, simply, to, provide, enough, room, for, the, sunfish, to, swim, in, wide, circles, the, tank, must, also, be, sufficiently, deep, to, accommodate, the, vertical, height, of, the, sunfish, which, may, reach, 3, 2, m, 10, ft, 6, in, feeding, captive, sunfish, in, a, tank, with, faster, moving, more, aggressive, fish, can, also, present, a, challenge, eventually, the, fish, can, be, taught, to, respond, to, a, floating, target, to, be, fed, and, to, take, food, from, the, end, of, a, pole, or, from, human, hands
