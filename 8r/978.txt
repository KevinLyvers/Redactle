former, subgenera, rhododendron, r, o, d, d, n, d, r, n, pl, rhododendra, is, a, very, large, genus, of, about, 1, 024, species, of, woody, plants, in, the, heath, family, ericaceae, they, can, be, either, evergreen, or, deciduous, most, species, are, native, to, eastern, asia, and, the, himalayan, region, but, smaller, numbers, occur, elsewhere, in, asia, and, in, north, america, europe, and, australia, it, is, the, national, flower, of, nepal, the, state, flower, of, washington, and, west, virginia, in, the, united, states, the, state, flower, of, nagaland, and, himachal, pradesh, in, india, the, provincial, flower, of, jiangxi, in, china, and, the, state, tree, of, sikkim, and, uttarakhand, in, india, most, species, have, brightly, colored, flowers, which, bloom, from, late, winter, through, to, early, summer, azaleas, make, up, two, subgenera, of, rhododendron, they, are, distinguished, from, true, rhododendrons, by, having, only, five, anthers, per, flower, the, common, and, generic, name, comes, from, ancient, greek, rh, don, rose, and, d, ndron, tree, rhododendron, is, a, genus, of, shrubs, and, small, to, rarely, large, trees, the, smallest, species, growing, to, 10, 100, cm, 4, 40, in, tall, and, the, largest, r, protistum, var, giganteum, reported, to, 30, m, 100, ft, tall, the, leaves, are, spirally, arranged, leaf, size, can, range, from, 1, 2, cm, 0, 4, 0, 8, in, to, over, 50, cm, 20, in, exceptionally, 100, cm, 40, in, in, r, sinogrande, they, may, be, either, evergreen, or, deciduous, in, some, species, the, undersides, of, the, leaves, are, covered, with, scales, lepidote, or, hairs, indumentum, some, of, the, best, known, species, are, noted, for, their, many, clusters, of, large, flowers, a, recently, discovered, species, in, new, guinea, has, flowers, up, to, six, inches, fifteen, centimeters, in, width, the, largest, in, the, whole, genus, the, accompanying, photograph, shows, it, as, having, seven, petals, there, are, alpine, species, with, small, flowers, and, small, leaves, and, tropical, species, such, as, section, vireya, that, often, grow, as, epiphytes, species, in, this, genus, may, be, part, of, the, heath, complex, in, oak, heath, forests, in, eastern, north, america, they, have, frequently, been, divided, based, on, the, presence, or, absence, of, scales, on, the, abaxial, lower, leaf, surface, lepidote, or, elepidote, these, scales, unique, to, subgenus, rhododendron, are, modified, hairs, consisting, of, a, polygonal, scale, attached, by, a, stalk, rhododendron, are, characterised, by, having, inflorescences, with, scarious, dry, perulae, a, chromosome, number, of, x, 13, fruit, that, has, a, septicidal, capsule, an, ovary, that, is, superior, or, nearly, so, stamens, that, have, no, appendages, and, agglutinate, clumped, pollen, rhododendron, is, the, largest, genus, in, the, family, ericaceae, with, over, 1, 000, species, though, estimates, vary, from, 850, to, 1, 200, and, is, morphologically, diverse, consequently, the, taxonomy, has, been, historically, complex, although, rhododendrons, had, been, known, since, the, description, of, rhododendron, hirsutum, by, charles, de, l, cluse, clusius, in, the, sixteenth, century, and, were, known, to, classical, writers, magor, 1990, and, referred, to, as, chamaerhododendron, low, growing, rose, tree, the, genus, was, first, formally, described, by, linnaeus, in, his, species, plantarum, in, 1753, he, listed, five, species, under, rhododendron, r, ferrugineum, the, type, species, r, dauricum, r, hirsutum, r, chamaecistus, now, rhodothamnus, chamaecistus, l, rchb, and, r, maximum, at, that, time, he, considered, the, then, known, six, species, of, azalea, that, he, had, described, earlier, in, 1735, in, his, systema, naturae, as, a, separate, genus, linnaeus, six, species, of, azalea, were, azalea, indica, a, pontica, a, lutea, a, viscosa, a, lapponica, and, a, procumbens, now, kalmia, procumbens, which, he, distinguished, from, rhododendron, by, having, five, stamens, as, opposed, to, ten, as, new, species, of, what, are, now, considered, rhododendron, were, discovered, they, were, assigned, to, separate, genera, if, they, seemed, to, differ, significantly, from, the, type, species, for, instance, rhodora, linnaeus, 1763, for, rhododendron, canadense, vireya, blume, 1826, and, hymenanthes, blume, 1826, for, rhododendron, metternichii, now, r, degronianum, meanwhile, other, botanists, such, as, salisbury, 1796, and, tate, 1831, began, to, question, the, distinction, between, azalea, and, rhododendron, and, finally, in, 1836, azalea, was, incorporated, into, rhododendron, and, the, genus, divided, into, eight, sections, of, these, tsutsutsi, tsutsusi, pentanthera, pogonanthum, ponticum, and, rhodora, are, still, used, the, other, sections, being, lepipherum, booram, and, chamaecistus, this, structure, largely, survived, till, recently, 2004, following, which, the, development, of, molecular, phylogeny, led, to, major, re, examinations, of, traditional, morphological, classifications, although, other, authors, such, as, candolle, who, described, six, sections, used, slightly, different, numeration, soon, as, more, species, became, available, in, the, nineteenth, century, so, did, a, better, understanding, of, the, characteristics, necessary, for, the, major, divisions, chief, amongst, these, were, maximovicz, s, rhododendreae, asiae, orientali, and, planchon, maximovicz, used, flower, bud, position, and, its, relationship, with, leaf, buds, to, create, eight, sections, bentham, and, hooker, used, a, similar, scheme, but, called, the, divisions, series, it, was, not, until, 1893, that, koehne, appreciated, the, significance, of, scaling, and, hence, the, separation, of, lepidote, and, elepidote, species, the, large, number, of, species, that, were, available, by, the, early, twentieth, century, prompted, a, new, approach, when, balfour, introduced, the, concept, of, grouping, species, into, series, the, species, of, rhododendron, referred, to, this, series, concept, as, the, balfourian, system, that, system, continued, up, to, modern, times, in, davidian, s, four, volume, the, rhododendron, species, the, next, major, attempt, at, classification, was, by, sleumer, who, from, 1934, began, incorporating, the, balfourian, series, into, the, older, hierarchical, structure, of, subgenera, and, sections, according, to, the, international, code, of, botanical, nomenclature, culminating, in, 1949, with, his, ein, system, der, gattung, rhododendron, l, and, subsequent, refinements, most, of, the, balfourian, series, are, represented, by, sleumer, as, subsections, though, some, appear, as, sections, or, even, subgenera, sleumer, based, his, system, on, the, relationship, of, the, flower, buds, to, the, leaf, buds, habitat, flower, structure, and, whether, the, leaves, were, lepidote, or, non, lepidote, while, sleumer, s, work, was, widely, accepted, many, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, continued, to, use, the, simpler, balfourian, system, of, the, edinburgh, group, sleumer, s, system, underwent, many, revisions, by, others, predominantly, the, edinburgh, group, in, their, continuing, royal, botanic, garden, edinburgh, notes, cullen, of, the, edinburgh, group, placing, more, emphasis, on, the, lepidote, characteristics, of, the, leaves, united, all, of, the, lepidote, species, into, subgenus, rhododendron, including, four, of, sleumer, s, subgenera, rhododendron, pseudoazalea, pseudorhodorastrum, rhodorastrum, in, 1986, philipson, philipson, raised, two, sections, of, subgenus, aleastrum, mumeazalea, candidastrum, to, subgenera, while, reducing, genus, therorhodion, to, a, subgenus, of, rhododendron, in, 1987, spethmann, adding, phytochemical, features, proposed, a, system, with, fifteen, subgenera, grouped, into, three, chorus, subgenera, a, number, of, closely, related, genera, had, been, included, together, with, rhododendron, in, a, former, tribe, rhodoreae, these, have, been, progressively, incorporated, into, rhododendron, chamberlain, and, rae, moved, the, monotypic, section, tsusiopsis, together, with, the, monotypic, genus, tsusiophyllum, into, section, tsutsusi, while, kron, judd, reduced, genus, ledum, to, a, subsection, of, section, rhododendron, then, judd, kron, moved, two, species, r, schlippenbachii, and, r, quinquefolium, from, section, brachybachii, subgenus, tsutsusi, and, two, from, section, rhodora, subgenus, pentanthera, r, albrechtii, r, pentaphyllum, into, section, sciadorhodion, subgenus, pentanthera, finally, chamberlain, brought, the, various, systems, together, in, 1996, with, 1, 025, species, divided, into, eight, subgenera, goetsch, 2005, provides, a, comparison, of, the, sleumer, and, chamberlain, schemata, table, 1, rhododendron, choniastrum, hymenanthes, azaleastrum, therorhodion, the, era, of, molecular, analysis, rather, than, descriptive, features, can, be, dated, to, the, work, of, kurashige, 1988, and, kron, 1997, who, used, matk, sequencing, later, gao, et, al, 2002, used, its, sequences, to, determine, a, cladistic, analysis, they, confirmed, that, the, genus, rhododendron, was, monophyletic, with, subgenus, therorhodion, in, the, basal, position, consistent, with, the, matk, studies, following, publication, of, the, studies, of, goetsch, et, al, 2005, with, rpb2, there, began, an, ongoing, realignment, of, species, and, groups, within, the, genus, based, on, evolutionary, relationships, their, work, was, more, supportive, of, sleumer, s, original, system, than, the, later, modifications, introduced, by, chamberlain, et, al, the, major, finding, of, goetsch, and, colleagues, was, that, all, species, examined, except, r, camtschaticum, subgenus, therorhodion, formed, three, major, clades, which, they, labelled, a, b, and, c, with, the, subgenera, rhododendron, and, hymenanthes, as, monophyletic, groups, nested, within, clades, a, and, b, respectively, by, contrast, subgenera, azaleastrum, and, pentanthera, were, polyphyletic, while, r, camtschaticum, appeared, as, a, sister, to, all, other, rhododendrons, the, small, polyphyletic, subgenera, pentanthera, and, azaleastrum, were, divided, between, two, clades, the, four, sections, of, pentanthera, between, clades, b, and, c, with, two, each, while, azaleastrum, had, one, section, in, each, of, a, and, c, thus, subgenera, azaleastrum, and, pentanthera, needed, to, be, disassembled, and, rhododendron, hymenanthes, and, tsutsusi, correspondingly, expanded, in, addition, to, the, two, separate, genera, included, under, rhododendron, by, chamberlain, ledum, tsusiophyllum, goetsch, et, al, added, menziesia, clade, c, despite, a, degree, of, paraphyly, the, subgenus, rhododendron, was, otherwise, untouched, with, regard, to, its, three, sections, but, four, other, subgenera, were, eliminated, and, one, new, subgenus, created, leaving, a, total, of, five, subgenera, in, all, from, eight, in, chamberlain, s, scheme, the, discontinued, subgenera, are, pentanthera, tsutsusi, candidastrum, and, mumeazalea, while, a, new, subgenus, was, created, by, elevating, subgenus, azaleastrum, section, choniastrum, to, subgenus, rank, subgenus, pentanthera, deciduous, azaleas, with, its, four, sections, was, dismembered, by, eliminating, two, sections, and, redistributing, the, other, two, between, the, existing, subgenera, in, clades, b, hymenanthes, and, c, azaleastrum, although, the, name, was, retained, in, section, pentanthera, 14, species, which, was, moved, to, subgenus, hymenanthes, of, the, remaining, three, sections, monotypic, viscidula, was, discontinued, by, moving, r, nipponicum, to, tsutsusi, c, while, rhodora, 2, species, was, itself, polyphyletic, and, was, broken, up, by, moving, r, canadense, to, section, pentanthera, b, and, r, vaseyi, to, section, sciadorhodion, which, then, became, a, new, section, of, subgenus, azaleastrum, c, subgenus, tsutsusi, c, was, reduced, to, section, status, retaining, the, name, and, included, in, subgenus, azaleastrum, of, the, three, minor, subgenera, all, in, c, two, were, discontinued, the, single, species, of, monotypic, subgenus, candidastrum, r, albiflorum, was, moved, to, subgenus, azaleastrum, section, sciadorhodion, similarly, the, single, species, in, monotypic, subgenus, mumeazalea, r, semibarbatum, was, placed, in, the, new, section, tsutsusi, subgenus, azaleastrum, genus, menziesa, 9, species, was, also, added, to, section, sciadorhodion, the, remaining, small, subgenus, therorhodion, with, its, two, species, was, left, intact, thus, two, subgenera, hymenanthes, and, azaleastrum, were, expanded, at, the, expense, of, four, subgenera, that, were, eliminated, although, azaleastrum, lost, one, section, choniastrum, as, a, new, subgenus, since, it, was, a, distinct, subclade, in, a, in, all, hymenanthes, increased, from, one, to, two, sections, while, azaleastrum, by, losing, one, section, and, gaining, two, increased, from, two, to, three, sections, see, schemata, under, subgenera, subsequent, research, has, supported, the, revision, by, goetsch, although, has, largely, concentrated, on, further, defining, the, phylogeny, within, the, subdivisions, in, 2011, the, two, species, of, diplarche, were, also, added, to, rhododendron, incertae, sedis, this, genus, has, been, progressively, subdivided, into, a, hierarchy, of, subgenus, section, subsection, and, species, terminology, from, the, sleumer, 1949, system, is, frequently, found, in, older, literature, with, five, subgenera, and, is, as, follows, in, the, later, traditional, classification, attributed, to, chamberlain, 1996, and, as, used, by, horticulturalists, and, the, american, rhododendron, society, rhododendron, has, eight, subgenera, based, on, morphology, namely, the, presence, of, scales, lepidote, deciduousness, of, leaves, and, the, floral, and, vegetative, branching, patterns, after, sleumer, 1980, these, consist, of, four, large, and, four, small, subgenera, the, first, two, subgenera, rhododendron, and, hymenanthes, represent, the, species, commonly, considered, as, rhododendrons, the, next, two, smaller, subgenera, pentanthera, and, tsutsusi, represent, the, azaleas, the, remaining, four, subgenera, contain, very, few, species, the, largest, of, these, is, subgenus, rhododendron, containing, nearly, half, of, all, known, species, and, all, of, the, lepidote, species, for, a, comparison, of, the, sleumer, and, chamberlain, systems, see, goetsch, et, al, 2005, table, 1, this, division, was, based, on, a, number, of, what, were, thought, to, be, key, morphological, characteristics, these, included, the, position, of, the, inflorescence, buds, terminal, or, lateral, whether, lepidote, or, elepidote, deciduousness, of, leaves, and, whether, new, foliage, was, derived, from, axils, from, previous, year, s, shoots, or, the, lowest, scaly, leaves, following, the, cladistic, analysis, of, goetsch, et, al, 2005, this, scheme, was, simplified, based, on, the, discovery, of, three, major, clades, a, b, c, as, follows, clade, a, clade, b, clade, c, sister, taxon, the, larger, subgenera, are, further, subdivided, into, sections, and, subsections, some, subgenera, contain, only, a, single, section, and, some, sections, only, a, single, subsection, shown, here, is, the, traditional, classification, with, species, number, after, chamberlain, 1996, but, this, scheme, is, undergoing, constant, revision, revisions, by, goetsch, et, al, 2005, and, by, craven, et, al, 2008, shown, in, parenthetical, italics, older, ranks, such, as, series, groups, of, species, are, no, longer, used, but, may, be, found, in, the, literature, but, the, american, rhododendron, society, still, uses, a, similar, device, called, alliances, the, system, used, by, the, world, flora, online, as, of, december, 2023, uses, six, subgenera, four, of, which, are, divided, further, species, of, the, genus, rhododendron, are, widely, distributed, between, latitudes, 80, n, and, 20, s, and, are, native, to, areas, from, north, america, to, europe, russia, and, asia, and, from, greenland, to, queensland, australia, and, the, solomon, islands, the, centres, of, diversity, are, in, the, himalayas, and, maritime, southeast, asia, with, the, greatest, species, diversity, in, the, sino, himalayan, region, southwest, china, and, northern, burma, from, india, himachal, pradesh, uttarakhand, sikkim, and, nagaland, to, nepal, northwestern, yunnan, and, western, sichuan, and, southeastern, tibet, other, significant, areas, of, diversity, are, in, the, mountains, of, korea, japan, and, taiwan, more, than, 90, of, rhododendron, sensu, chamberlain, belong, to, the, asian, subgenera, rhododendron, hymenanthes, and, section, tsutsusi, of, the, first, two, of, these, the, species, are, predominantly, found, in, the, area, of, the, himalayas, and, southwest, china, sino, himalayan, region, the, 300, tropical, species, within, the, vireya, section, of, subgenus, rhododendron, occupy, the, maritime, southeast, asia, from, their, presumed, southeast, asian, origin, to, northern, australia, with, 55, known, species, in, borneo, and, 164, in, new, guinea, the, species, in, new, guinea, are, native, to, subalpine, moist, grasslands, at, around, 3, 000, metres, above, sea, level, in, the, central, highlands, subgenera, rhododendron, and, hymenanthes, together, with, section, pentanthera, of, subgenus, pentanthera, are, also, represented, to, a, lesser, degree, in, the, mountainous, areas, of, north, america, and, western, eurasia, subgenus, tsutsusi, is, found, in, the, maritime, regions, of, east, asia, japan, korea, taiwan, east, china, but, not, in, north, america, or,

rhododendrons, prefer, acid, soils, with, a, ph, of, roughly, 4, 5, 5, 5, some, tropical, vireyas, and, a, few, other, rhododendron, species, grow, as, epiphytes, and, require, a, planting, mix, similar, to, orchids, rhododendrons, have, fibrous, roots, and, prefer, well, drained, soils, high, in, organic, material, in, areas, with, poorly, drained, or, alkaline, soils, rhododendrons, are, often, grown, in, raised, beds, using, media, such, as, composted, pine, bark, mulching, and, careful, watering, are, important, especially, before, the, plant, is, established, a, new, calcium, tolerant, stock, of, rhododendrons, trademarked, as, inkarho, has, been, exhibited, at, the, rhs, chelsea, flower, show, in, london, 2011, individual, hybrids, of, rhododendrons, have, been, grafted, on, to, a, rootstock, on, a, single, rhododendron, plant, that, was, found, growing, in, a, chalk, quarry, the, rootstock, is, able, to, grow, in, calcium, rich, soil, up, to, a, ph, of, 7, 5, rhododendrons, are, extensively, hybridized, in, cultivation, and, natural, hybrids, often, occur, in, areas, where, species, ranges, overlap, there, are, over, 28, 000, cultivars, of, rhododendron, in, the, international, rhododendron, registry, held, by, the, royal, horticultural, society, most, have, been, bred, for, their, flowers, but, a, few, are, of, garden, interest, because, of, ornamental, leaves, and, some, for, ornamental, bark, or, stems, some, hybrids, have, fragrant, flowers, such, as, the, loderi, hybrids, created, by, crossing, rhododendron, fortunei, and, r, griffithianum, other, examples, include, the, pjm, hybrids, formed, from, a, cross, between, rhododendron, carolinianum, and, r, dauricum, and, named, after, peter, j, mezitt, of, weston, nurseries, massachusetts, some, species, of, rhododendron, are, poisonous, to, grazing, animals, because, of, a, toxin, called, grayanotoxin, in, their, pollen, and, nectar, people, have, been, known, to, become, ill, from, eating, mad, honey, made, by, bees, feeding, on, rhododendron, and, azalea, flowers, xenophon, described, the, odd, behaviour, of, greek, soldiers, after, having, consumed, honey,
