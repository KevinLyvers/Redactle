nut, and, the, cashew, apple, an, accessory, fruit, the, tree, can, grow, as, tall, as, 14, metres, 46, feet, but, the, dwarf, cultivars, growing, up, to, 6, m, 20, ft, prove, more, profitable, with, earlier, maturity, and, greater, yields, the, cashew, nut, is, edible, and, is, eaten, on, its, own, as, a, snack, used, in, recipes, or, processed, into, cashew, cheese, or, cashew, butter, the, nut, is, often, simply, called, a, cashew, in, 2019, four, million, tonnes, of, cashew, nuts, were, produced, globally, with, ivory, coast, and, india, the, leading, producers, as, well, as, the, nut, and, fruit, the, plant, has, several, other, uses, the, shell, of, the, cashew, seed, yields, derivatives, that, can, be, used, in, many, applications, including, lubricants, waterproofing, paints, and, starting, in, world, war, ii, arms, production, the, cashew, apple, is, a, light, reddish, to, yellow, fruit, whose, pulp, and, juice, can, be, processed, into, a, sweet, astringent, fruit, drink, or, fermented, and, distilled, into, liquor, the, cashew, tree, is, large, and, evergreen, growing, to, 14, metres, 46, feet, tall, with, a, short, often, irregularly, shaped, trunk, the, leaves, are, spirally, arranged, leathery, textured, elliptic, to, obovate, 4, 22, centimetres, 1, 1, 2, 8, 3, 4, inches, long, and, 2, 15, cm, 3, 4, 6, in, broad, with, smooth, margins, the, flowers, are, produced, in, a, panicle, or, corymb, up, to, 26, cm, 10, in, long, each, flower, is, small, pale, green, at, first, then, turning, reddish, with, five, slender, acute, petals, 7, 15, millimetres, 1, 4, 5, 8, in, long, the, largest, cashew, tree, in, the, world, covers, an, area, around, 7, 500, m, 2, 81, 000, sq, ft, and, is, located, in, natal, brazil, the, fruit, of, the, cashew, tree, is, an, accessory, fruit, sometimes, called, a, pseudocarp, or, false, fruit, what, appears, to, be, the, fruit, is, an, oval, or, pear, shaped, structure, a, hypocarpium, that, develops, from, the, pedicel, and, the, receptacle, of, the, cashew, flower, called, the, cashew, apple, better, known, in, central, america, as, mara, n, it, ripens, into, a, yellow, or, red, structure, about, 5, 11, cm, 2, 4, 1, 4, in, long, the, true, fruit, of, the, cashew, tree, is, a, kidney, shaped, or, boxing, glove, shaped, drupe, that, grows, at, the, end, of, the, cashew, apple, the, drupe, first, develops, on, the, tree, and, then, the, pedicel, expands, to, become, the, cashew, apple, the, drupe, becomes, the, true, fruit, a, single, shell, encased, seed, which, is, often, considered, a, nut, in, the, culinary, sense, the, seed, is, surrounded, by, a, double, shell, that, contains, an, allergenic, phenolic, resin, anacardic, acid, which, is, a, potent, skin, irritant, chemically, related, to, the, better, known, and, also, toxic, allergenic, oil, urushiol, which, is, found, in, the, related, poison, ivy, and, lacquer, tree, the, english, name, derives, from, the, portuguese, name, for, the, fruit, of, the, cashew, tree, caju, portuguese, pronunciation, also, known, as, acaju, which, itself, is, from, the, tupi, word, acaj, literally, meaning, nut, that, produces, itself, the, generic, name, anacardium, is, composed, of, the, greek, prefix, ana, an, up, upward, the, greek, cardia, kard, a, heart, and, the, neo, latin, suffix, ium, it, possibly, refers, to, the, heart, shape, of, the, fruit, to, the, top, of, the, fruit, stem, or, to, the, seed, the, word, anacardium, was, earlier, used, to, refer, to, semecarpus, anacardium, the, marking, nut, tree, before, carl, linnaeus, transferred, it, to, the, cashew, both, plants, are, in, the, same, family, the, epithet, occidentale, derives, from, the, western, or, occidental, world, the, plant, has, diverse, common, names, in, various, languages, among, its, wide, distribution, range, including, anacardier, french, with, the, fruit, referred, to, as, pomme, de, cajou, caju, portuguese, pronunciation, or, acaju, portuguese, the, species, is, native, to, tropical, south, america, and, later, was, distributed, around, the, world, in, the, 1500s, by, portuguese, explorers, portuguese, colonists, in, brazil, began, exporting, cashew, nuts, as, early, as, the, 1550s, the, portuguese, took, it, to, goa, formerly, estado, da, ndia, portuguesa, in, india, between, 1560, and, 1565, from, there, it, spread, throughout, southeast, asia, and, eventually, africa, the, cashew, tree, is, cultivated, in, the, tropics, between, 25, n, and, 25, s, and, is, well, adapted, to, hot, lowland, areas, with, a, pronounced, dry, season, where, the, mango, and, tamarind, trees, also, thrive, the, traditional, cashew, tree, is, tall, up, to, 14, m, 46, ft, and, takes, three, years, from, planting, before, it, starts, production, and, eight, years, before, economic, harvests, can, begin, more, recent, breeds, such, as, the, dwarf, cashew, trees, are, up, to, 6, m, 20, ft, tall, and, start, producing, after, the, first, year, with, economic, yields, after, three, years, the, cashew, nut, yields, for, the, traditional, tree, are, about, 0, 25, t, ha, 0, 100, long, ton, acre, 0, 11, short, ton, acre, in, contrast, to, over, a, ton, per, hectare, for, the, dwarf, variety, grafting, and, other, modern, tree, management, technologies, are, used, to, further, improve, and, sustain, cashew, nut, yields, in, commercial, orchards, in, 2021, global, production, of, cashew, nuts, as, the, kernel, was, 3, 7, million, tonnes, led, by, ivory, coast, and, india, with, a, combined, 43, of, the, world, total, table, the, top, ten, exporters, of, cashew, nuts, in, shell, hs, code, 080131, in, value, usd, in, 2021, were, ghana, tanzania, guinea, bissau, nigeria, ivory, coast, burkina, faso, senegal, indonesia, united, arab, emirates, uae, and, guinea, from, 2017, to, 2021, the, top, ten, exporters, of, cashew, nuts, shelled, hs, code, 080132, were, vietnam, india, the, netherlands, germany, brazil, ivory, coast, nigeria, indonesia, burkina, faso, and, the, united, states, in, 2014, the, rapid, growth, of, cashew, cultivation, in, the, ivory, coast, made, this, country, the, top, african, exporter, fluctuations, in, world, market, prices, poor, working, conditions, and, low, pay, for, local, harvesting, have, caused, discontent, in, the, cashew, nut, industry, almost, all, cashews, produced, in, africa, between, 2000, and, 2019, were, exported, as, raw, nuts, which, are, much, less, profitable, than, shelled, nuts, one, of, the, goals, of, the, african, cashew, alliance, is, to, promote, africa, s, cashew, processing, capabilities, to, improve, the, profitability, of, africa, s, cashew, industry, in, 2011, human, rights, watch, reported, that, forced, labour, was, used, for, cashew, processing, in, vietnam, around, 40, 000, current, or, former, drug, users, were, forced, to, remove, shells, from, blood, cashews, or, perform, other, work, and, often, beaten, at, more, than, 100, rehabilitation, centers, some, people, are, allergic, to, cashews, but, they, are, a, less, frequent, allergen, than, other, tree, nuts, or, peanuts, for, up, to, 6, of, children, and, 3, of, adults, consuming, cashews, may, cause, allergic, reactions, ranging, from, mild, discomfort, to, life, threatening, anaphylaxis, these, allergies, are, triggered, by, the, proteins, found, in, tree, nuts, and, cooking, often, does, not, remove, or, change, these, proteins, reactions, to, cashew, and, tree, nuts, can, also, occur, as, a, consequence, of, hidden, nut, ingredients, or, traces, of, nuts, that, may, inadvertently, be, introduced, during, food, processing, handling, or, manufacturing, the, shell, of, the, cashew, nut, contains, oil, compounds, that, can, cause, contact, dermatitis, similar, to, poison, ivy, primarily, resulting, from, the, phenolic, lipids, anacardic, acid, and, cardanol, because, it, can, cause, dermatitis, cashews, are, typically, not, sold, in, the, shell, to, consumers, readily, and, inexpensively, extracted, from, the, waste, shells, cardanol, is, under, research, for, its, potential, applications, in, nanomaterials, and, biotechnology,

tree, seeds, called, nuts, cashews, are, commonly, used, in, south, asian, cuisine, whole, for, garnishing, sweets, or, curries, or, ground, into, a, paste, that, forms, a, base, of, sauces, for, curries, e, g, korma, or, some, sweets, e, g, kaju, barfi, it, is, also, used, in, powdered, form, in, the, preparation, of, several, indian, sweets, and, desserts, in, goan, cuisine, both, roasted, and, raw, kernels, are, used, whole, for, making, curries, and, sweets, cashews, are, also, used, in, thai, and, chinese, cuisines, generally, in, whole, form, in, the, philippines, cashew, is, a, known, product, of, antipolo, and, is, eaten, with, suman, the, province, of, pampanga, also, has, a, sweet, dessert, called, turrones, de, casuy, which, is, cashew, marzipan, wrapped, in, white, wafers, in, indonesia, roasted, and, salted, cashews, are, called, kacang, mete, or, kacang, mede, while, the, cashew, apple, is, called, jambu, monyet, lit, monkey, rose, apple, in, the, 21st, century, cashew, cultivation, increased, in, several, african, countries, to, meet, the, manufacturing, demands, for, cashew, milk, a, plant, milk, alternative, to, dairy, milk, in, mozambique, bolo, polana, is, a, cake, prepared, using, powdered, cashews, and, mashed, potatoes, as, the, main, ingredients, this, dessert, is, common, in, south, africa, the, cashew, nut, kernel, has, a, slight, curvature, and, two, cotyledons, each, representing, around, 20, 25, of, the, weight, of, the, nut, it, is, encased, in, a, reddish, brown, membrane, called, a, husk, which, accounts, for, approximately, 5, of, the, total, nut, cashew, nut, husk, is, used, in, emerging, industrial, applications, such, as, an, adsorbent, composites, biopolymers, dyes, and, enzyme, synthesis, the, mature, cashew, apple, can, be, eaten, fresh, cooked, in, curries, or, fermented, into, vinegar, citric, acid, or, an, alcoholic, drink, it, is, also, used, to, make, preserves, chutneys, and, jams, in, some, countries, such, as, india, and, brazil, in, many, countries, particularly, in, south, america, the, cashew, apple, is, used, to, flavor, drinks, both, alcoholic, and, nonalcoholic, in, brazil, cashew, fruit, juice, and, fruit, pulp, are, used, in, the, production, of, sweets, and, juice, mixed, with, alcoholic, beverages, such, as, cacha, a, and, as, flour, milk, or, cheese, in, panama, the, cashew, fruit, is, cooked, with, water, and, sugar, for, a, prolonged, time, to, make, a, sweet, brown, paste, like, dessert, called, dulce, de, mara, n, mara, n, being, a, spanish, name, for, cashew, cashew, nuts, are, more, widely, traded, than, cashew, apples, because, the, fruit, unlike, the, nut, is, easily, bruised, and, has, a, very, limited, shelf, life, cashew, apple, juice, however, may, be, used, for, manufacturing, blended, juices, when, the, apple, is, consumed, its, astringency, is, sometimes, removed, by, steaming, the, fruit, for, five, minutes, before, washing, it, in, cold, water, steeping, the, fruit, in, boiling, salt, water, for, five, minutes, also, reduces, the, astringency, in, cambodia, where, the, plant, is, usually, grown, as, an, ornamental, rather, than, an, economic, tree, the, fruit, is, a, delicacy, and, is, eaten, with, salt, in, the, indian, state, of, goa, the, ripened, cashew, apples, are, mashed, and, the, juice, called, neero, is, extracted, and, kept, for, fermentation, for, a, few, days, this, fermented, juice, then, undergoes, a, double, distillation, process, the, resulting, beverage, is, called, feni, or, fenny, feni, is, about, 40, 42, alcohol, 80, 84, proof, the, single, distilled, version, is, called, urrak, which, is, about, 15, alcohol, 30, proof, in, tanzania, the, cashew, apple, bibo, in, swahili, is, dried, and, reconstituted, with, water, and, fermented, then, distilled, to, make, a, strong, liquor, called, gongo, cashew, nut, oil, is, a, dark, yellow, oil, derived, from, pressing, the, cashew, nuts, typically, from, lower, value, broken, chunks, created, accidentally, during, processing, and, is, used, for, cooking, or, as, a, salad, dressing, the, highest, quality, oil, is, produced, from, a, single, cold, pressing, cashew, nutshell, liquid, cnsl, or, cashew, shell, oil, cas, registry, number, 8007, 24, 7, is, a, natural, resin, with, a, yellowish, sheen, found, in, the, honeycomb, structure, of, the, cashew, nutshell, and, is, a, byproduct, of, processing, cashew, nuts, as, it, is, a, strong, irritant, it, should, not, be, confused, with, edible, cashew, nut, oil, it, is, dangerous, to, handle, in, small, scale, processing, of, the, shells, but, is, itself, a, raw, material, with, multiple, uses, it, is, used, in, tropical, folk, medicine, and, for, anti, termite, treatment, of, timber, its, composition, varies, depending, on, how, it, is, processed, these, substances, are, skin, allergens, like, lacquer, and, the, oils, of, poison, ivy, and, they, present, a, danger, during, manual, cashew, processing, this, natural, oil, phenol, has, interesting, chemical, structural, features, that, can, be, modified, to, create, a, wide, spectrum, of, biobased, monomers, these, capitalize, on, the, chemically, versatile, construct, which, contains, three, functional, groups, the, aromatic, ring, the, hydroxyl, group, and, the, double, bonds, in, the, flanking, alkyl, chain, these, include, polyols, which, have, recently, seen, increased, demand, for, their, biobased, origin, and, key, chemical, attributes, such, as, high, reactivity, range, of, functionalities, reduction, in, blowing, agents, and, naturally, occurring, fire, retardant, properties, in, the, field, of, rigid, polyurethanes, aided, by, their, inherent, phenolic, structure, and, larger, number, of, reactive, units, per, unit, mass, cnsl, may, be, used, as, a, resin, for, carbon, composite, products, cnsl, based, novolac, is, another, versatile, industrial, monomer, deriving, from, cardanol, typically, used, as, a, reticulating, agent, hardener, for, epoxy, matrices, in, composite, applications, providing, good, thermal, and, mechanical, properties, to, the, final, composite, material, discarded, cashew, nuts, unfit, for, human, consumption, alongside, the, residues, of, oil, extraction, from, cashew, kernels, can, be, fed, to, livestock, animals, can, also,
