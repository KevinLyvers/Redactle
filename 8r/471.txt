see, text, the, exocoetidae, are, a, family, of, marine, ray, finned, fish, in, the, order, beloniformes, known, colloquially, as, flying, fish, or, flying, cod, about, 64, species, are, grouped, in, seven, genera, while, they, cannot, fly, in, the, same, way, a, bird, does, flying, fish, can, make, powerful, self, propelled, leaps, out, of, the, water, where, their, long, wing, like, fins, enable, gliding, for, considerable, distances, above, the, water, s, surface, the, main, reason, for, this, behavior, is, thought, to, be, to, escape, from, underwater, predators, which, include, swordfish, mackerel, tuna, and, marlin, among, others, though, their, periods, of, flight, expose, them, to, attack, by, avian, predators, such, as, frigate, birds, barbados, is, known, as, the, land, of, the, flying, fish, and, the, fish, is, one, of, the, national, symbols, of, the, country, the, exocet, missile, is, named, after, them, as, variants, are, launched, from, underwater, and, take, a, low, trajectory, skimming, the, surface, before, striking, their, targets, the, term, exocoetidae, is, both, the, scientific, name, and, the, general, name, in, latin, for, a, flying, fish, the, suffix, idae, common, for, indicating, a, family, follows, the, root, of, the, latin, word, exocoetus, a, transliteration, of, the, ancient, greek, name, this, means, literally, sleeping, outside, from, outside, and, bed, resting, place, with, the, verb, root, to, lie, down, not, untruth, so, named, as, flying, fish, were, believed, to, leave, the, water, to, sleep, ashore, or, due, to, flying, fish, flying, and, thus, stranding, themselves, in, boats, the, exocoetidae, is, divided, into, four, subfamilies, and, seven, genera, flying, fish, live, in, all, of, the, oceans, particularly, in, tropical, and, warm, subtropical, waters, they, are, commonly, found, in, the, epipelagic, zone, the, top, layer, of, the, ocean, to, a, depth, of, about, 200, m, 660, ft, numerous, morphological, features, give, flying, fish, the, ability, to, leap, above, the, surface, of, the, ocean, one, such, feature, is, fully, broadened, neural, arches, which, act, as, insertion, sites, for, connective, tissues, and, ligaments, in, a, fish, s, skeleton, fully, broadened, neural, arches, act, as, more, stable, and, sturdier, sites, for, these, connections, creating, a, strong, link, between, the, vertebral, column, and, cranium, a, steady, glide, will, improve, their, flight, duration, and, allow, them, to, be, above, water, an, unsteady, glide, will, not, impact, their, flight, as, much, but, will, shorten, their, flight, duration, not, much, more, than, a, steady, flight, this, also, will, vary, based, on, their, energy, consumption, this, ultimately, allows, a, rigid, and, sturdy, vertebral, column, body, that, is, beneficial, in, flight, having, a, rigid, body, during, glided, flight, gives, the, flying, fish, aerodynamic, advantages, increasing, its, speed, and, improving, its, aim, furthermore, flying, fish, have, developed, vertebral, columns, and, ossified, caudal, complexes, these, features, provide, the, majority, of, strength, to, the, flying, fish, allowing, them, to, physically, lift, their, bodies, out, of, water, and, glide, remarkable, distances, these, additions, also, reduce, the, flexibility, of, the, flying, fish, allowing, them, to, perform, powerful, leaps, without, weakening, midair, at, the, end, of, a, glide, they, fold, their, pectoral, fins, to, re, enter, the, sea, or, drop, their, tails, into, the, water, to, push, against, the, water, to, lift, for, another, glide, possibly, changing, direction, the, curved, profile, of, the, wing, is, comparable, to, the, aerodynamic, shape, of, a, bird, wing, the, fish, is, able, to, increase, its, time, in, the, air, by, flying, straight, into, or, at, an, angle, to, the, direction, of, updrafts, created, by, a, combination, of, air, and, ocean, currents, species, of, genus, exocoetus, have, one, pair, of, fins, and, streamlined, bodies, to, optimize, for, speed, while, cypselurus, spp, have, flattened, bodies, and, two, pairs, of, fins, which, maximize, their, time, in, the, air, from, 1900, to, the, 1930s, flying, fish, were, studied, as, possible, models, used, to, develop, airplanes, the, exocoetidae, feed, mainly, on, plankton, predators, include, dolphins, tuna, marlin, birds, squid, and, porpoises, in, may, 2008, a, japanese, television, crew, nhk, filmed, a, flying, fish, dubbed, icarfish, off, the, coast, of, yakushima, island, japan, the, fish, spent, 45, seconds, in, flight, the, previous, record, was, 42, seconds, the, flights, of, flying, fish, are, typically, around, 50, m, 160, ft, though, they, can, use, updrafts, at, the, leading, edge, of, waves, to, cover, distances, up, to, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, they, can, travel, at, speeds, of, more, than, 70, km, h, 43, mph, maximum, altitude, is, 6, m, 20, ft, above, the, surface, of, the, sea, flying, fish, often, accidentally, land, on, the, decks, of, smaller, vessels, flying, fish, are, commercially, fished, in, japan, vietnam, and, china, by, gillnetting, and, in, indonesia, and, india, by, dipnetting, often, in, japanese, cuisine, the, fish, is, preserved, by, drying, to, be, used, as, fish, stock, for, dashi, broth, the, roe, of, cheilopogon, agoo, or, japanese, flying, fish, is, used, to, make, some, types, of, sushi, and, is, known, as, tobiko, it, is, also, a, staple, in, the, diet, of, the, tao, people, of, orchid, island, taiwan, flying, fish, is, part, of, the, national, dish, of, barbados, cou, cou, and, flying, fish, the, taste, is, close, to, that, of, a, sardine, flying, fish, roe, is, known, as, cau, cau, in, southern, peru, and, is, used, to, make, several, local, dishes, in, the, solomon, islands, the, fish, are, caught, while, they, are, flying, using, nets, held, from, outrigger, canoes, they, are, attracted, to, the, light, of, torches, fishing, is, done, only, when, no, moonlight, is, available, barbados, is, known, as, the, land, of, the, flying, fish, and, the, fish, is, one, of, the, national, symbols, of, the, country, once, abundant, it, migrated, between, the, warm, coral, filled, atlantic, ocean, surrounding, the, island, of, barbados, and, the, plankton, rich, outflows, of, the, orinoco, river, in, venezuela, just, after, the, completion, of, the, bridgetown, harbor, deep, water, harbor, in, bridgetown, barbados, had, an, increase, of, ship, visits, linking, the, island, to, the, world, the, overall, health, of, the, coral, reefs, surrounding, barbados, suffered, due, to, ship, based, pollution, additionally, barbadian, overfishing, pushed, them, closer, to, the, orinoco, delta, no, longer, returning, to, barbados, in, large, numbers, today, the, flying, fish, only, migrate, as, far, north, as, tobago, around, 120, nmi, 220, km, 140, mi, southwest, of, barbados, despite, the, change, flying, fish, remain, a, coveted, delicacy, many, aspects, of, barbadian, culture, center, around, the, flying, fish, it, is, depicted, on, coins, as, sculptures, in, fountains, in, artwork, and, as, part, of, the, official, logo, of, the, barbados, tourism, authority, additionally, the, barbadian, coat, of, arms, features, a, pelican, and, dolphinfish, on, either, side, of, the, shield, but, the, dolphinfish, resembles, a, flying, fish, furthermore, actual, artistic, renditions, and, holograms, of, the, flying, fish, are, also, present, within, the, barbadian, passport, flying, fish, have, also, been, gaining, in, popularity, in, other, islands, fueling, several, maritime, disputes, in, 2006, the, council, of, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, law, of, the, sea, fixed, the, maritime, boundaries, between, barbados, and, trinidad, and, tobago, over, the, flying, fish, dispute, which, gradually, raised, tensions, between, the, neighbours, the, ruling, stated, both, countries, must, preserve, stocks, for, the, future, barbadian, fishers, still, follow, the, flying, fish, southward, makassar, fishermen, in, south, sulawesi, have, been, catching, flying, fish, torani, in, special, boats, called, patorani, for, centuries, developing, their, own, sailing, traditions, along, the, way, these, fishermen, were, able, to, sail, as, far, as, kimberley, region, in, west, of, australia, reaching, the, indigenous, people, there, the, oldest, known, fossil, of, a, flying, or, gliding, fish, are, those, of, the, extinct, family, thoracopteridae, dating, back, to, the, middle, triassic, 235, 242, million, years, ago, however, they, are, thought, to, be, basal, neopterygians, and, are, not, related, to, modern, flying, fish, with, the, wing, like, pectoral, fins, being, convergently, evolved, in, both, lineages, similarly, the, cheirothricidae, of, the, late, cretaceous, also, similarly, evolved, wing, like, pectoral, fins, that, were, likely, also, used, for, gliding, but, are, indeterminate, eurypterygians, they, are, possibly, aulopiformes, which, would, make, them, most, closely, related, to, lizardfish
