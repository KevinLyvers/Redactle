see, text, the, leopard, panthera, pardus, is, one, of, the, five, extant, species, in, the, genus, panthera, it, has, a, pale, yellowish, to, dark, golden, fur, with, dark, spots, grouped, in, rosettes, its, body, is, slender, and, muscular, reaching, a, length, of, 92, 183, cm, 36, 72, in, with, a, 66, 102, cm, 26, 40, in, long, tail, and, a, shoulder, height, of, 60, 70, cm, 24, 28, in, males, typically, weigh, 30, 9, 72, kg, 68, 159, lb, and, females, 20, 5, 43, kg, 45, 95, lb, the, leopard, was, first, described, in, 1758, and, several, subspecies, were, proposed, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, today, eight, subspecies, are, recognised, in, its, wide, range, in, africa, and, asia, it, initially, evolved, in, africa, during, the, early, pleistocene, before, migrating, into, eurasia, around, the, early, middle, pleistocene, transition, leopards, were, formerly, present, across, europe, but, became, extinct, in, the, region, at, around, the, end, of, the, late, pleistocene, early, holocene, the, leopard, is, adapted, to, a, variety, of, habitats, ranging, from, rainforest, to, steppe, including, arid, and, montane, areas, it, is, an, opportunistic, predator, hunting, mostly, ungulates, and, primates, it, relies, on, its, spotted, pattern, for, camouflage, as, it, stalks, and, ambushes, its, prey, which, it, sometimes, drags, up, a, tree, it, is, a, solitary, animal, outside, the, mating, season, and, when, raising, cubs, females, usually, give, birth, to, a, litter, of, 2, 4, cubs, once, in, 15, 24, months, both, male, and, female, leopards, typically, reach, sexual, maturity, at, the, age, 2, 2, 5, years, listed, as, vulnerable, on, the, iucn, red, list, leopard, populations, are, currently, threatened, by, habitat, loss, and, fragmentation, and, are, declining, in, large, parts, of, the, global, range, leopards, have, had, cultural, roles, in, ancient, greece, west, africa, and, modern, western, culture, leopard, skins, are, popular, in, fashion, the, english, name, leopard, comes, from, old, french, leupart, or, middle, french, liepart, that, derives, from, latin, leopardus, and, ancient, greek, leopardos, leopardos, could, be, a, compound, of, le, n, meaning, lion, and, pardos, meaning, spotted, the, word, originally, referred, to, a, cheetah, acinonyx, jubatus, panther, is, another, common, name, derived, from, latin, panther, and, ancient, greek, p, nth, r, the, generic, name, panthera, originates, in, latin, panthera, a, hunting, net, for, catching, wild, beasts, to, be, used, by, the, romans, in, combats, pardus, is, the, masculine, singular, form, felis, pardus, was, the, scientific, name, proposed, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, the, generic, name, panthera, was, first, used, by, lorenz, oken, in, 1816, who, included, all, the, known, spotted, cats, into, this, group, oken, s, classification, was, not, widely, accepted, and, felis, or, leopardus, was, used, as, the, generic, name, until, the, early, 20th, century, the, leopard, was, designated, as, the, type, species, of, panthera, by, joel, asaph, allen, in, 1902, in, 1917, reginald, innes, pocock, also, subordinated, the, tiger, p, tigris, lion, p, leo, and, jaguar, p, onca, to, panthera, following, linnaeus, first, description, 27, leopard, subspecies, were, proposed, by, naturalists, between, 1794, and, 1956, since, 1996, only, eight, subspecies, have, been, considered, valid, on, the, basis, of, mitochondrial, analysis, later, analysis, revealed, a, ninth, valid, subspecies, the, arabian, leopard, in, 2017, the, cat, classification, task, force, of, the, cat, specialist, group, recognized, the, following, eight, subspecies, as, valid, taxa, the, balochistan, leopard, population, in, the, south, of, iran, afghanistan, and, pakistan, is, separated, from, the, northern, population, by, the, dasht, e, kavir, and, dasht, e, lut, deserts, results, of, an, analysis, of, molecular, variance, and, pairwise, fixation, index, of, 182, african, leopard, museum, specimens, showed, that, some, african, leopards, exhibit, higher, genetic, differences, than, asian, leopard, subspecies, results, of, phylogenetic, studies, based, on, nuclear, dna, and, mitochondrial, dna, analysis, showed, that, the, last, common, ancestor, of, the, panthera, and, neofelis, genera, is, thought, to, have, lived, about, 6, 37, million, years, ago, neofelis, diverged, about, 8, 66, million, years, ago, from, the, panthera, lineage, the, tiger, diverged, about, 6, 55, million, years, ago, followed, by, the, snow, leopard, about, 4, 63, million, years, ago, and, the, leopard, about, 4, 35, million, years, ago, the, leopard, is, a, sister, taxon, to, a, clade, within, panthera, consisting, of, the, lion, and, the, jaguar, results, of, a, phylogenetic, analysis, of, chemical, secretions, amongst, cats, indicated, that, the, leopard, is, closely, related, to, the, lion, the, geographic, origin, of, the, panthera, is, most, likely, northern, central, asia, the, leopard, lion, clade, was, distributed, in, the, asian, and, african, palearctic, since, at, least, the, early, pliocene, the, leopard, lion, clade, diverged, 3, 1, 1, 95, million, years, ago, additionally, a, 2016, study, revealed, that, the, mitochondrial, genomes, of, the, leopard, lion, and, snow, leopard, are, more, similar, to, each, other, than, their, nuclear, genomes, indicating, that, their, ancestors, hybridized, with, the, snow, leopard, at, some, point, in, their, evolution, the, oldest, unambiguous, fossils, of, the, leopard, are, from, eastern, africa, dating, to, around, 2, million, years, ago, leopard, like, fossil, bones, and, teeth, possibly, dating, to, the, pliocene, were, excavated, in, perrier, in, france, northeast, of, london, and, in, valdarno, italy, until, 1940, similar, fossils, dating, back, to, the, pleistocene, were, excavated, mostly, in, loess, and, caves, at, 40, sites, in, europe, including, furninha, cave, near, lisbon, genista, caves, in, gibraltar, and, santander, province, in, northern, spain, to, several, sites, across, france, switzerland, italy, austria, germany, in, the, north, up, to, derby, in, england, in, the, east, to, p, erov, in, the, czech, republic, and, the, baranya, in, southern, hungary, leopards, arrived, in, eurasia, during, the, late, early, to, middle, pleistocene, around, 1, 2, to, 0, 6, million, years, ago, four, european, pleistocene, leopard, subspecies, were, proposed, p, p, begoueni, from, the, beginning, of, the, early, pleistocene, was, replaced, about, 0, 6, million, years, ago, by, p, p, sickenbergi, which, in, turn, was, replaced, by, p, p, antiqua, around, 0, 3, million, years, ago, p, p, spelaea, is, the, most, recent, subspecies, that, appeared, at, the, beginning, of, the, late, pleistocene, and, survived, until, about, 11, 000, years, ago, and, possibly, into, the, early, holocene, in, the, iberian, peninsula, leopards, depicted, in, cave, paintings, in, chauvet, cave, provide, indirect, evidence, of, leopard, presence, in, europe, leopard, fossils, dating, to, the, late, pleistocene, were, found, in, bi, nik, cave, in, south, central, poland, fossil, remains, were, also, excavated, in, the, iberian, and, italian, peninsula, and, in, the, balkans, leopard, fossils, dating, to, the, pleistocene, were, also, excavated, in, the, japanese, archipelago, leopard, fossils, were, also, found, in, taiwan, in, 1953, a, male, leopard, and, a, female, lion, were, crossbred, in, hanshin, park, in, nishinomiya, japan, their, offspring, known, as, a, leopon, was, born, in, 1959, and, 1961, all, cubs, were, spotted, and, bigger, than, a, juvenile, leopard, attempts, to, mate, a, leopon, with, a, tigress, proved, unsuccessful, the, leopard, s, fur, is, generally, soft, and, thick, notably, softer, on, the, belly, than, on, the, back, its, skin, colour, varies, between, individuals, from, pale, yellowish, to, dark, golden, with, dark, spots, grouped, in, rosettes, its, underbelly, is, white, and, its, ringed, tail, is, shorter, than, its, body, its, pupils, are, round, leopards, living, in, arid, regions, are, pale, cream, yellowish, to, ochraceous, and, rufous, in, colour, those, living, in, forests, and, mountains, are, much, darker, and, deep, golden, spots, fade, toward, the, white, underbelly, and, the, insides, and, lower, parts, of, the, legs, rosettes, are, circular, in, east, african, leopard, populations, and, tend, to, be, squarish, in, southern, african, and, larger, in, asian, leopard, populations, the, fur, tends, to, be, grayish, in, colder, climates, and, dark, golden, in, rainforest, habitats, rosette, patterns, are, unique, in, each, individual, this, pattern, is, thought, to, be, an, adaptation, to, dense, vegetation, with, patchy, shadows, where, it, serves, as, camouflage, its, white, tipped, tail, is, about, 60, 100, cm, 23, 6, 39, 4, in, long, white, underneath, and, with, spots, that, form, incomplete, bands, toward, the, end, of, the, tail, the, guard, hairs, protecting, the, basal, hairs, are, short, 3, 4, mm, 0, 1, 0, 2, in, in, face, and, head, and, increase, in, length, toward, the, flanks, and, the, belly, to, about, 25, 30, mm, 1, 0, 1, 2, in, juveniles, have, woolly, fur, that, appear, to, be, dark, coloured, due, to, the, densely, arranged, spots, its, fur, tends, to, grow, longer, in, colder, climates, the, leopard, s, rosettes, differ, from, those, of, the, jaguar, which, are, darker, and, with, smaller, spots, inside, the, leopard, has, a, diploid, chromosome, number, of, 38, melanistic, leopards, are, also, known, as, black, panthers, melanism, in, leopards, is, caused, by, a, recessive, allele, and, is, inherited, as, a, recessive, trait, in, india, nine, pale, and, white, leopards, were, reported, between, 1905, and, 1967, leopards, exhibiting, erythrism, were, recorded, between, 1990, and, 2015, in, south, africa, s, madikwe, game, reserve, and, in, mpumalanga, the, cause, of, this, morph, known, as, a, strawberry, leopard, or, pink, panther, is, not, well, understood, the, leopard, is, a, slender, and, muscular, cat, with, relatively, short, limbs, and, a, broad, head, it, is, sexually, dimorphic, with, males, larger, and, heavier, than, females, males, stand, 60, 70, cm, 24, 28, in, at, the, shoulder, while, females, are, 57, 64, cm, 22, 25, in, tall, the, head, and, body, length, ranges, between, 92, and, 183, cm, 36, and, 72, in, with, a, 66, to, 102, cm, 26, to, 40, in, long, tail, sizes, vary, geographically, males, typically, weigh, 30, 9, 72, kg, 68, 159, lb, and, females, 20, 5, 43, kg, 45, 95, lb, occasionally, large, males, can, grow, up, to, 91, kg, 201, lb, leopards, from, the, cape, province, in, south, africa, are, generally, smaller, reaching, only, 20, 45, kg, 44, 99, lb, in, males, the, heaviest, wild, leopard, in, southern, africa, weighed, around, 96, kg, 212, lb, and, it, measured, 262, cm, 103, in, in, 2016, an, indian, leopard, killed, in, himachal, pradesh, measured, 261, cm, 103, in, with, an, estimated, weight, of, 78, 5, kg, 173, lb, it, was, perhaps, the, largest, known, wild, leopard, in, india, the, largest, recorded, skull, of, a, leopard, was, found, in, india, in, 1920, and, measured, 28, cm, 11, in, in, basal, length, 20, cm, 7, 9, in, in, breadth, and, weighed, 1, kg, 2, 2, lb, the, skull, of, an, african, leopard, measured, 286, mm, 11, 3, in, in, basal, length, and, 181, mm, 7, 1, in, in, breadth, and, weighed, 790, g, 28, oz, the, leopard, has, the, largest, distribution, of, all, wild, cats, occurring, widely, in, africa, and, asia, although, populations, are, fragmented, and, declining, it, inhabits, foremost, savanna, and, rainforest, and, areas, where, grasslands, woodlands, and, riparian, forests, remain, largely, undisturbed, it, also, persists, in, urban, environments, if, it, is, not, persecuted, has, sufficient, prey, and, patches, of, vegetation, for, shelter, during, the, day, the, leopard, s, range, in, west, africa, is, estimated, to, have, drastically, declined, by, 95, and, in, the, sahara, desert, by, 97, in, sub, saharan, africa, it, is, still, numerous, and, surviving, in, marginal, habitats, where, other, large, cats, have, disappeared, in, southeastern, egypt, an, individual, found, killed, in, 2017, was, the, first, sighting, of, the, leopard, in, this, area, in, 65, years, in, west, asia, the, leopard, inhabits, remain, in, the, areas, of, southern, and, southeastern, anatolia, leopard, populations, in, the, arabian, peninsula, are, small, and, fragmented, in, the, indian, subcontinent, the, leopard, is, still, relatively, abundant, with, greater, numbers, than, those, of, other, panthera, species, some, leopard, populations, in, india, live, quite, close, to, human, settlements, and, even, in, semi, developed, areas, although, adaptable, to, human, disturbances, leopards, require, healthy, prey, populations, and, appropriate, vegetative, cover, for, hunting, for, prolonged, survival, and, thus, rarely, linger, in, heavily, developed, areas, due, to, the, leopard, s, stealth, people, often, remain, unaware, that, it, lives, in, nearby, areas, as, of, 2020, the, leopard, population, within, forested, habitats, in, india, s, tiger, range, landscapes, was, estimated, at, 12, 172, to, 13, 535, individuals, surveyed, landscapes, included, elevations, below, 2, 600, m, 8, 500, ft, in, the, shivalik, hills, and, gangetic, plains, central, india, and, eastern, ghats, western, ghats, the, brahmaputra, river, basin, and, hills, in, northeast, india, in, nepal, s, kanchenjunga, conservation, area, a, melanistic, leopard, was, photographed, at, an, elevation, of, 4, 300, m, 14, 100, ft, by, a, camera, trap, in, may, 2012, in, sri, lanka, leopards, were, recorded, in, yala, national, park, and, in, unprotected, forest, patches, tea, estates, grasslands, home, gardens, pine, and, eucalyptus, plantations, in, myanmar, leopards, were, recorded, for, the, first, time, by, camera, traps, in, the, hill, forests, of, myanmar, s, karen, state, the, northern, tenasserim, forest, complex, in, southern, myanmar, is, considered, a, leopard, stronghold, in, thailand, leopards, are, present, in, the, western, forest, complex, kaeng, krachan, kui, buri, khlong, saeng, khao, sok, protected, area, complexes, and, in, hala, bala, wildlife, sanctuary, bordering, malaysia, in, peninsular, malaysia, leopards, are, present, in, belum, temengor, taman, negara, and, endau, rompin, national, parks, in, laos, leopards, were, recorded, in, nam, et, phou, louey, national, biodiversity, conservation, area, and, nam, kan, national, protected, area, in, cambodia, leopards, inhabit, deciduous, dipterocarp, forest, in, phnom, prich, wildlife, sanctuary, and, mondulkiri, protected, forest, in, southern, china, leopards, were, recorded, only, in, the, qinling, mountains, during, surveys, in, 11, nature, reserves, between, 2002, and, 2009, in, java, leopards, inhabit, dense, tropical, rainforests, and, dry, deciduous, forests, at, elevations, from, sea, level, to, 2, 540, m, 8, 330, ft, outside, protected, areas, leopards, were, recorded, in, mixed, agricultural, land, secondary, forest, and, production, forest, between, 2008, and, 2014, in, the, russian, far, east, it, inhabits, temperate, coniferous, forests, where, winter, temperatures, reach, a, low, of, 25, c, 13, f, the, leopard, is, a, solitary, and, territorial, animal, it, is, typically, shy, and, alert, when, crossing, roadways, and, encountering, oncoming, vehicles, but, may, be, emboldened, to, attack, people, or, other, animals, when, threatened, adults, associate, only, in, the, mating, season, females, continue, to, interact, with, their, offspring, even, after, weaning, and, have, been, observed, sharing, kills, with, their, offspring, when, they, can, not, obtain, any, prey, they, produce, a, number, of, vocalizations, including, growls, snarls, meows, and, purrs, the, roaring, sequence, in, leopards, consists, mainly, of, grunts, also, called, sawing, as, it, resembles, the, sound, of, sawing, wood, cubs, call, their, mother, with, an, urr, urr, sound, the, whitish, spots, on, the, back, of, its, ears, are, thought, to, play, a, role, in, communication, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, the, white, tips, of, their, tails, may, function, as, a, follow, me, signal, in, intraspecific, communication, however, no, significant, association, were, found, between, a, conspicuous, colour, of, tail, patches, and, behavioural, variables, in, carnivores, leopards, are, mainly, active, from, dusk, till, dawn, and, will, rest, for, most, of, the, day, and, some, hours, at, night, in, thickets, among, rocks, or, over, tree, branches, leopards, have, been, observed, walking, 1, 25, km, 0, 62, 15, 53, mi, across, their, range, at, night, wandering, up, to, 75, km, 47, mi, if, disturbed, in, some, regions, they, are, nocturnal, in, western, african, forests, they, have, been, observed, to, be, largely, diurnal, and, hunting, during, twilight, when, their, prey, animals, are, active, activity, patterns, vary, between, seasons, leopards, can, climb, trees, quite, skillfully, often, resting, on, tree, branches, and, descending, headfirst, they, can, run, at, over, 58, km, h, 36, mph, 16, m, s, leap, over, 6, m, 20, ft, horizontally, and, jump, up, to, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, vertically, in, kruger, national, park, most, leopards, tend, to, keep, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, apart, males, occasionally, interact, with, their, partners, and, cubs, and, exceptionally, this, can, extend, beyond, to, two, generations, aggressive, encounters, are, rare, typically, limited, to, defending, territories, from, intruders, in, a, south, african, reserve, a, male, was, wounded, in, a, male, male, territorial, battle, over, a, carcass, males, occupy, home, ranges, that, often, overlap, with, a, few, smaller, female, home, ranges, probably, as, a, strategy, to, enhance, access, to, females, in, the, ivory, coast, the, home, range, of, a, female, was, completely, enclosed, within, a, male, s, females, live, with, their, cubs, in, home, ranges, that, overlap, extensively, probably, due, to, the, association, between, mothers, and, their, offspring, there, may, be, a, few, other, fluctuating, home, ranges, belonging, to, young, individuals, it, is, not, clear, if, male, home, ranges, overlap, as, much, as, those, of, females, do, individuals, try, to, drive, away, intruders, of, the, same, sex, a, study, of, leopards, in, the, namibian, farmlands, showed, that, the, size, of, home, ranges, was, not, significantly, affected, by, sex, rainfall, patterns, or, season, the, higher, the, prey, availability, in, an, area, the, greater, the, leopard, population, density, and, the, smaller, the, size, of, home, ranges, but, they, tend, to, expand, if, there, is, human, interference, sizes, of, home, ranges, vary, geographically, and, depending, on, habitat, and, availability, of, prey, in, the, serengeti, males, have, home, ranges, of, 33, 38, km, 2, 13, 15, sq, mi, and, females, of, 14, 16, km, 2, 5, 4, 6, 2, sq, mi, but, males, in, northeastern, namibia, of, 451, km, 2, 174, sq, mi, and, females, of, 188, km, 2, 73, sq, mi, they, are, even, larger, in, arid, and, montane, areas, in, nepal, s, bardia, national, park, male, home, ranges, of, 48, km, 2, 19, sq, mi, and, female, ones, of, 5, 7, km, 2, 1, 9, 2, 7, sq, mi, are, smaller, than, those, generally, observed, in, africa, the, leopard, is, a, carnivore, that, prefers, medium, sized, prey, with, a, body, mass, ranging, from, 10, 40, kg, 22, 88, lb, prey, species, in, this, weight, range, tend, to, occur, in, dense, habitat, and, to, form, small, herds, species, that, prefer, open, areas, and, have, well, developed, anti, predator, strategies, are, less, preferred, more, than, 100, prey, species, have, been, recorded, the, most, preferred, species, are, ungulates, such, as, impala, bushbuck, common, duiker, and, chital, primates, preyed, upon, include, white, eyelid, mangabeys, guenons, and, gray, langurs, leopards, also, kill, smaller, carnivores, like, black, backed, jackal, bat, eared, fox, genet, and, cheetah, in, urban, environments, domestic, dogs, provide, an, important, food, source, the, largest, prey, killed, by, a, leopard, was, reportedly, a, male, eland, weighing, 900, kg, 2, 000, lb, a, study, in, wolong, national, nature, reserve, in, southern, china, demonstrated, variation, in, the, leopard, s, diet, over, time, over, the, course, of, seven, years, the, vegetative, cover, receded, and, leopards, opportunistically, shifted, from, primarily, consuming, tufted, deer, to, pursuing, bamboo, rats, and, other, smaller, prey, the, leopard, depends, mainly, on, its, acute, senses, of, hearing, and, vision, for, hunting, it, primarily, hunts, at, night, in, most, areas, in, western, african, forests, and, tsavo, national, park, they, have, also, been, observed, hunting, by, day, they, usually, hunt, on, the, ground, in, the, serengeti, they, have, been, seen, to, ambush, prey, by, descending, on, it, from, trees, it, stalks, its, prey, and, tries, to, approach, as, closely, as, possible, typically, within, 5, m, 16, ft, of, the, target, and, finally, pounces, on, it, and, kills, it, by, suffocation, it, kills, small, prey, with, a, bite, to, the, back, of, the, neck, but, holds, larger, animals, by, the, throat, and, strangles, them, it, caches, kills, up, to, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, apart, it, is, able, to, take, large, prey, due, to, its, powerful, jaw, muscles, and, is, therefore, strong, enough, to, drag, carcasses, heavier, than, itself, up, into, trees, an, individual, was, seen, to, haul, a, young, giraffe, weighing, nearly, 125, kg, 276, lb, up, 5, 7, m, 18, ft, 8, in, into, a, tree, it, eats, small, prey, immediately, but, drags, larger, carcasses, over, several, hundred, meters, and, caches, it, safely, in, trees, bushes, or, even, caves, this, behaviour, allows, the, leopard, to, store, its, prey, away, from, rivals, and, offers, it, an, advantage, over, them, the, way, it, stores, the, kill, depends, on, local, topography, and, individual, preferences, varying, from, trees, in, kruger, national, park, to, bushes, in, the, plain, terrain, of, the, kalahari, average, daily, consumption, rates, of, 3, 5, kg, 7, lb, 11, oz, were, estimated, for, males, and, of, 2, 8, kg, 6, lb, 3, oz, for, females, in, the, southern, kalahari, desert, leopards, meet, their, water, requirements, by, the, bodily, fluids, of, prey, and, succulent, plants, they, drink, water, every, two, to, three, days, and, feed, infrequently, on, moisture, rich, plants, such, as, gemsbok, cucumbers, watermelon, and, kalahari, sour, grass, across, its, range, the, leopard, coexists, with, a, number, of, other, large, predators, in, africa, it, is, part, of, a, large, predator, guild, with, lions, cheetahs, spotted, and, brown, hyenas, and, african, wild, dogs, the, leopard, is, dominant, only, over, the, cheetah, while, the, others, have, the, advantage, of, size, pack, numbers, or, both, lions, pose, a, great, mortal, threat, and, can, be, responsible, for, 22, of, leopard, deaths, in, sabi, sand, game, reserve, spotted, hyenas, are, less, threatening, but, are, more, likely, to, steal, kills, being, the, culprits, of, up, to, 50, of, stolen,
