hands, means, 14, hands, and, 3, inches, i, e, decimally, 14, 75, hands, some, people, classify, an, animal, as, either, horse, or, pony, from, its, pedigree, and, phenotype, no, matter, what, its, height, a, full, sized, horse, may, sometimes, even, be, called, a, pony, as, a, term, of, endearment, for, many, forms, of, competition, the, official, definition, of, a, pony, is, a, horse, that, measures, less, than, 14, 2, hands, 58, inches, 147, cm, at, the, withers, standard, horses, are, 14, 2, or, taller, the, international, federation, for, equestrian, sports, defines, the, official,

general, or, affectionately, for, any, small, horse, regardless, of, its, actual, size, or, breed, furthermore, some, horse, breeds, may, have, individuals, who, mature, under, that, height, but, are, still, called, horses, and, are, allowed, to, compete, as, horses, in, australia, horses, that, measure, from, 14, to, 15, hands, 142, to, 152, cm, 56, to, 60, inches, are, known, as, a, galloway, and, ponies, in, australia, measure, under, 14, hands, 56, inches, 142, cm, ponies, originally, developed, as, a, landrace, adapted, to, a, harsh, natural, environment, and, were, considered, part, of, the, draft, subtype, typical, of, northern, europe, at, one, time, it, was, hypothesized, that, they, may, have, descended, from, a, wild, draft, subspecies, of, equus, ferus, studies, of, mitochondrial, dna, which, is, passed, on, though, the, female, line, indicate, that, a, large, number, of, wild, mares, have, contributed, to, modern, domestic, breeds, in, contrast, studies, of, y, dna, passed, down, the, male, line, suggest, that, there, was, possibly, just, one, single, male, ancestor, of, all, domesticated, breeds, domestication, of, the, horse, probably, first, occurred, in, the, eurasian, steppes, with, horses, of, between, 13, hands, 52, inches, 132, cm, to, over, 14, hands, 56, inches, 142, cm, and, as, horse, domestication, spread, the, male, descendants, of, the, original, stallion, went, on, to, be, bred, with, local, wild, mares, domesticated, ponies, of, all, breeds, originally, developed, mainly, from, the, need, for, a, working, animal, that, could, fulfill, specific, local, draft, and, transportation, needs, while, surviving, in, harsh, environments, the, usefulness, of, the, pony, was, noted, by, farmers, who, observed, that, a, pony, could, outperform, a, draft, horse, on, small, farms, by, the, 20th, century, many, pony, breeds, had, arabian, and, other, blood, added, to, make, a, more, refined, pony, suitable, for, riding, in, many, parts, of, the, world, ponies, are, used, as, working, animals, as, pack, animals, and, for, pulling, various, horse, drawn, vehicles, they, are, seen, in, many, different, equestrian, pursuits, some, breeds, such, as, the, hackney, pony, are, primarily, used, for, driving, while, other, breeds, such, as, the, connemara, pony, and, australian, pony, are, used, primarily, for, riding, others, such, as, the, welsh, pony, are, used, for, both, riding, and, driving, there, is, no, direct, correlation, between, a, horse, s, size, and, its, inherent, athletic, ability, ponies, are, often, distinguished, by, their, phenotype, a, stocky, body, dense, bone, round, shape, and, well, sprung, ribs, they, have, a, short, head, large, eyes, and, small, ears, in, addition, to, being, smaller, than, a, horse, their, legs, are, proportionately, shorter, they, have, strong, hooves, and, grow, a, heavier, hair, coat, seen, in, a, thicker, mane, and, tail, as, well, as, a, particularly, heavy, winter, coat, pony, breeds, have, developed, all, over, the, world, particularly, in, cold, and, harsh, climates, where, hardy, sturdy, working, animals, were, needed, they, are, remarkably, strong, for, their, size, breeds, such, as, the, connemara, pony, are, recognized, for, their, ability, to, carry, a, full, sized, adult, rider, pound, for, pound, ponies, can, pull, and, carry, more, weight, than, a, horse, draft, type, ponies, are, able, to, pull, loads, significantly, greater, than, their, own, weight, with, larger, ponies, capable, of, pulling, loads, comparable, to, those, pulled, by, full, sized, draft, horses, and, even, very, small, ponies, are, able, to, pull, as, much, as, 450, percent, of, their, own, weight, nearly, all, pony, breeds, are, very, hardy, easy, keepers, that, share, the, ability, to, thrive, on, a, more, limited, diet, than, that, of, a, regular, sized, horse, requiring, half, the, hay, for, their, weight, as, a, horse, and, often, not, needing, grain, at, all, however, for, the, same, reason, they, are, also, more, vulnerable, to, laminitis, and, cushing, s, syndrome, they, may, also, have, problems, with, hyperlipemia, ponies, are, generally, considered, intelligent, and, friendly, though, sometimes, they, also, are, described, as, stubborn, or, cunning, the, differences, of, opinion, often, result, from, an, individual, pony, s, degree, of, proper, training, ponies, trained, by, inexperienced, individuals, or, only, ridden, by, beginners, can, turn, out, to, be, spoiled, because, their, riders, typically, lack, the, experience, base, to, correct, bad, habits, properly, trained, ponies, are, appropriate, mounts, for, children, who, are, learning, to, ride, larger, ponies, can, be, ridden, by, adults, as, ponies, are, usually, strong, for, their, size, for, showing, purposes, ponies, are, often, grouped, into, small, medium, and, large, sizes, small, ponies, are, 12, 2, hands, 50, inches, 127, cm, and, under, medium, ponies, are, over, 12, 2, but, no, taller, than, 13, 2, hands, 54, inches, 137, cm, and, large, ponies, are, over, 13, 2, hands, 54, inches, 137, cm, but, no, taller, than, 14, 2, hands, 58, inches, 147, cm, the, smallest, equines, are, called, miniature, horses, by, many, of, their, breeders, and, breed, organizations, rather, than, ponies, even, though, they, stand, smaller, than, small, ponies, usually, no, taller, than, 38, inches, 97, cm, 9, 2, hands, at, the, withers, however, there, are, also, miniature, pony, breeds, some, horse, breeds, are, not, defined, as, ponies, even, when, they, have, some, animals, that, measure, under, 14, 2, hands, 58, inches, 147, cm, this, is, usually, due, to, body, build, traditional, uses, and, overall, physiology, breeds, that, are, considered, horses, regardless, of, height, include, the, arabian, horse, american, quarter, horse, and, the, morgan, horse, all, of, which, have, individual, members, both, over, and, under, 14, 2, hands, 58, inches, 147, cm, many, horse, breeds, have, some, pony, characteristics, such, as, small, size, a, heavy, coat, a, thick, mane, or, heavy, bone, but, are, considered, to, be, horses, in, cases, such, as, these, there, can, be, considerable, debate, over, whether, to, call, certain, breeds, horses, or, ponies, however, individual, breed, registries, usually, are, the, arbiters, of, such, debates, weighing, the, relative, horse, and, pony, characteristics, of, a, breed, in, some, breeds, such, as, the, welsh, pony, the, horse, versus, pony, controversy, is, resolved, by, creating, separate, divisions, for, consistently, horse, sized, animals, such, as, the, section, d, welsh, cob, some, horses, may, be, pony, height, due, to, environment, more, than, genetics, for, example, the, chincoteague, pony, a, feral, horse, that, lives, on, assateague, island, off, the, coasts, of, maryland, and, virginia, often, matures, to, the, height, of, an, average, small, horse, when, raised, from, a, foal, under, domesticated, conditions, conversely, the, term, pony, is, occasionally, used, to, describe, horses, of, normal, height, horses, used, for, polo, are, often, called, polo, ponies, regardless, of, height, even, though, they, are, often, of, thoroughbred, breeding, and, often, well, over, 14, 2, hands, 58, inches, 147, cm, american, indigenous, tribes, also, have, the, tradition, of, referring, to, their, horses, as, ponies, when, speaking, in, english, even, though, many, of, the, mustang, horses, they, used, in, the, 19th, century, were, close, to, or, over, 14, 2, hands, 58, inches, 147, cm, and, most, horses, owned, and, bred, by, native, peoples, today, are, of, full, horse, height, non, racing, horses, at, racetracks, that, are, used, to, lead, the, racehorses, ponying, them, are, called, pony, horses, the, term, pony, is, also, sometimes, used, to, describe, a, full, sized, horse, in, a, humorous, or, affectionate, sense, the, united, states, pony, club, defines, pony, to, be, any, mount, that, is, ridden, by, a, member, regardless, of, its, breed, or, size, persons, up, to, 25, years, old, are, eligible, for, membership, and, some, of, the, members, ponies, actually, are, full, size, horses
