chiropractic, k, a, r, o, p, r, k, t, k, is, a, form, of, alternative, medicine, concerned, with, the, diagnosis, treatment, and, prevention, of, mechanical, disorders, of, the, musculoskeletal, system, especially, of, the, spine, it, has, esoteric, origins, and, is, based, on, several, pseudoscientific, ideas, many, chiropractors, often, known, informally, as, chiros, especially, those, in, the, field, s, early, history, have, proposed, that, mechanical, disorders, of, the, joints, especially, of, the, spine, affect, general, health, and, that, regular, manipulation, of, the, spine, spinal, adjustment, improves, general, health, the, main, chiropractic, treatment, technique, involves, manual, therapy, especially, manipulation, of, the, spine, other, joints, and, soft, tissues, but, may, also, include, exercises, and, health, and, lifestyle, counseling, a, chiropractor, may, have, a, doctor, of, chiropractic, d, c, degree, and, be, referred, to, as, doctor, but, is, not, a, doctor, of, medicine, m, d, or, a, doctor, of, osteopathic, medicine, d, o, while, many, chiropractors, view, themselves, as, primary, care, providers, chiropractic, clinical, training, does, not, meet, the, requirements, for, that, designation, systematic, reviews, of, controlled, clinical, studies, of, treatments, used, by, chiropractors, have, found, no, evidence, that, chiropractic, manipulation, is, effective, with, the, possible, exception, of, treatment, for, back, pain, a, 2011, critical, evaluation, of, 45, systematic, reviews, concluded, that, the, data, included, in, the, study, fail, to, demonstrate, convincingly, that, spinal, manipulation, is, an, effective, intervention, for, any, condition, spinal, manipulation, may, be, cost, effective, for, sub, acute, or, chronic, low, back, pain, but, the, results, for, acute, low, back, pain, were, insufficient, no, compelling, evidence, exists, to, indicate, that, maintenance, chiropractic, care, adequately, prevents, symptoms, or, diseases, there, is, not, sufficient, data, to, establish, the, safety, of, chiropractic, manipulations, it, is, frequently, associated, with, mild, to, moderate, adverse, effects, with, serious, or, fatal, complications, in, rare, cases, there, is, controversy, regarding, the, degree, of, risk, of, vertebral, artery, dissection, which, can, lead, to, stroke, and, death, from, cervical, manipulation, several, deaths, have, been, associated, with, this, technique, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, relationship, is, causative, a, claim, which, is, disputed, by, many, chiropractors, chiropractic, is, well, established, in, the, united, states, canada, and, australia, it, overlaps, with, other, manual, therapy, professions, such, as, osteopathy, and, physical, therapy, most, who, seek, chiropractic, care, do, so, for, low, back, pain, back, and, neck, pain, are, considered, the, specialties, of, chiropractic, but, many, chiropractors, treat, ailments, other, than, musculoskeletal, issues, chiropractic, has, two, main, groups, straights, now, the, minority, emphasize, vitalism, innate, intelligence, and, consider, vertebral, subluxations, to, be, the, cause, of, all, disease, and, mixers, the, majority, are, more, open, to, mainstream, views, and, conventional, medical, techniques, such, as, exercise, massage, and, ice, therapy, d, d, palmer, founded, chiropractic, in, the, 1890s, after, saying, he, received, it, from, the, other, world, palmer, maintained, that, the, tenets, of, chiropractic, were, passed, along, to, him, by, a, doctor, who, had, died, 50, years, previously, his, son, b, j, palmer, helped, to, expand, chiropractic, in, the, early, 20th, century, throughout, its, history, chiropractic, has, been, controversial, its, foundation, is, at, odds, with, evidence, based, medicine, and, has, been, sustained, by, pseudoscientific, ideas, such, as, vertebral, subluxation, and, innate, intelligence, despite, the, overwhelming, evidence, that, vaccination, is, an, effective, public, health, intervention, among, chiropractors, there, are, significant, disagreements, over, the, subject, which, has, led, to, negative, impacts, on, both, public, vaccination, and, mainstream, acceptance, of, chiropractic, the, american, medical, association, called, chiropractic, an, unscientific, cult, in, 1966, and, boycotted, it, until, losing, an, antitrust, case, in, 1987, chiropractic, has, had, a, strong, political, base, and, sustained, demand, for, services, in, the, last, decades, of, the, twentieth, century, it, gained, more, legitimacy, and, greater, acceptance, among, conventional, physicians, and, health, plans, in, the, united, states, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, chiropractic, professional, associations, advised, chiropractors, to, adhere, to, cdc, who, and, local, health, department, guidance, despite, these, recommendations, a, small, but, vocal, and, influential, number, of, chiropractors, spread, vaccine, misinformation, chiropractic, is, generally, categorized, as, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, cam, which, focuses, on, manipulation, of, the, musculoskeletal, system, especially, the, spine, its, founder, d, d, palmer, called, it, a, science, of, healing, without, drugs, chiropractic, s, origins, lie, in, the, folk, medicine, of, bonesetting, and, as, it, evolved, it, incorporated, vitalism, spiritual, inspiration, and, rationalism, its, early, philosophy, was, based, on, deduction, from, irrefutable, doctrine, which, helped, distinguish, chiropractic, from, medicine, provided, it, with, legal, and, political, defenses, against, claims, of, practicing, medicine, without, a, license, and, allowed, chiropractors, to, establish, themselves, as, an, autonomous, profession, this, straight, philosophy, taught, to, generations, of, chiropractors, rejects, the, inferential, reasoning, of, the, scientific, method, and, relies, on, deductions, from, vitalistic, first, principles, rather, than, on, the, materialism, of, science, however, most, practitioners, tend, to, incorporate, scientific, research, into, chiropractic, and, most, practitioners, are, mixers, who, attempt, to, combine, the, materialistic, reductionism, of, science, with, the, metaphysics, of, their, predecessors, and, with, the, holistic, paradigm, of, wellness, a, 2008, commentary, proposed, that, chiropractic, actively, divorce, itself, from, the, straight, philosophy, as, part, of, a, campaign, to, eliminate, untestable, dogma, and, engage, in, critical, thinking, and, evidence, based, research, restoration, of, structural, integrity, improvement, of, health, status, innate, intelligence, body, physiology, although, a, wide, diversity, of, ideas, exist, among, chiropractors, they, share, the, belief, that, the, spine, and, health, are, related, in, a, fundamental, way, and, that, this, relationship, is, mediated, through, the, nervous, system, some, chiropractors, claim, spinal, manipulation, can, have, an, effect, on, a, variety, of, ailments, such, as, irritable, bowel, syndrome, and, asthma, chiropractic, philosophy, includes, the, following, perspectives, holism, assumes, that, health, is, affected, by, everything, in, an, individual, s, environment, some, sources, also, include, a, spiritual, or, existential, dimension, in, contrast, reductionism, in, chiropractic, reduces, causes, and, cures, of, health, problems, to, a, single, factor, vertebral, subluxation, homeostasis, emphasizes, the, body, s, inherent, self, healing, abilities, chiropractic, s, early, notion, of, innate, intelligence, can, be, thought, of, as, a, metaphor, for, homeostasis, a, large, number, of, chiropractors, fear, that, if, they, do, not, separate, themselves, from, the, traditional, vitalistic, concept, of, innate, intelligence, chiropractic, will, continue, to, be, seen, as, a, fringe, profession, a, variant, of, chiropractic, called, naprapathy, originated, in, chicago, in, the, early, twentieth, century, it, holds, that, manual, manipulation, of, soft, tissue, can, reduce, interference, in, the, body, and, thus, improve, health, straight, chiropractors, adhere, to, the, philosophical, principles, set, forth, by, d, d, and, b, j, palmer, and, retain, metaphysical, definitions, and, vitalistic, qualities, straight, chiropractors, believe, that, vertebral, subluxation, leads, to, interference, with, an, innate, intelligence, exerted, via, the, human, nervous, system, and, is, a, primary, underlying, risk, factor, for, many, diseases, straights, view, the, medical, diagnosis, of, patient, complaints, which, they, consider, to, be, the, secondary, effects, of, subluxations, to, be, unnecessary, for, chiropractic, treatment, thus, straight, chiropractors, are, concerned, primarily, with, the, detection, and, correction, of, vertebral, subluxation, via, adjustment, and, do, not, mix, other, types, of, therapies, into, their, practice, style, their, philosophy, and, explanations, are, metaphysical, in, nature, and, they, prefer, to, use, traditional, chiropractic, lexicon, terminology, such, as, perform, spinal, analysis, detect, subluxation, correct, with, adjustment, they, prefer, to, remain, separate, and, distinct, from, mainstream, health, care, although, considered, the, minority, group, they, have, been, able, to, transform, their, status, as, purists, and, heirs, of, the, lineage, into, influence, dramatically, out, of, proportion, to, their, numbers, mixer, chiropractors, mix, diagnostic, and, treatment, approaches, from, chiropractic, medical, or, osteopathic, viewpoints, and, make, up, the, majority, of, chiropractors, unlike, straight, chiropractors, mixers, believe, subluxation, is, one, of, many, causes, of, disease, and, hence, they, tend, to, be, open, to, mainstream, medicine, many, of, them, incorporate, mainstream, medical, diagnostics, and, employ, conventional, treatments, including, techniques, of, physical, therapy, such, as, exercise, stretching, massage, ice, packs, electrical, muscle, stimulation, therapeutic, ultrasound, and, moist, heat, some, mixers, also, use, techniques, from, alternative, medicine, including, nutritional, supplements, acupuncture, homeopathy, herbal, remedies, and, biofeedback, although, mixers, are, the, majority, group, many, of, them, retain, belief, in, vertebral, subluxation, as, shown, in, a, 2003, survey, of, 1, 100, north, american, chiropractors, which, found, that, 88, percent, wanted, to, retain, the, term, vertebral, subluxation, complex, and, that, when, asked, to, estimate, the, percent, of, disorders, of, internal, organs, that, subluxation, significantly, contributes, to, the, mean, response, was, 62, percent, a, 2008, survey, of, 6, 000, american, chiropractors, demonstrated, that, most, chiropractors, seem, to, believe, that, a, subluxation, based, clinical, approach, may, be, of, limited, utility, for, addressing, visceral, disorders, and, greatly, favored, non, subluxation, based, clinical, approaches, for, such, conditions, the, same, survey, showed, that, most, chiropractors, generally, believed, that, the, majority, of, their, clinical, approach, for, addressing, musculoskeletal, biomechanical, disorders, such, as, back, pain, was, based, on, subluxation, chiropractors, often, offer, conventional, therapies, such, as, physical, therapy, and, lifestyle, counseling, and, it, may, for, the, lay, person, be, difficult, to, distinguish, the, unscientific, from, the, scientific, in, science, based, medicine, the, term, subluxation, refers, to, an, incomplete, or, partial, dislocation, of, a, joint, from, the, latin, luxare, for, dislocate, while, medical, doctors, use, the, term, exclusively, to, refer, to, physical, dislocations, chiropractic, founder, d, d, palmer, imbued, the, word, subluxation, with, a, metaphysical, and, philosophical, meaning, drawn, from, pseudoscientific, traditions, such, as, vitalism, palmer, claimed, that, vertebral, subluxations, interfered, with, the, body, s, function, and, its, inborn, ability, to, heal, itself, d, d, palmer, repudiated, his, earlier, theory, that, vertebral, subluxations, caused, pinched, nerves, in, the, intervertebral, spaces, in, favor, of, subluxations, causing, altered, nerve, vibration, either, too, tense, or, too, slack, affecting, the, tone, health, of, the, end, organ, he, qualified, this, by, noting, that, knowledge, of, innate, intelligence, was, not, essential, to, the, competent, practice, of, chiropractic, this, concept, was, later, expanded, upon, by, his, son, b, j, palmer, and, was, instrumental, in, providing, the, legal, basis, of, differentiating, chiropractic, from, conventional, medicine, in, 1910, d, d, palmer, theorized, that, the, nervous, system, controlled, health, physiologists, divide, nerve, fibers, which, form, the, nerves, into, two, classes, afferent, and, efferent, impressions, are, made, on, the, peripheral, afferent, fiber, endings, these, create, sensations, that, are, transmitted, to, the, center, of, the, nervous, system, efferent, nerve, fibers, carry, impulses, out, from, the, center, to, their, endings, most, of, these, go, to, muscles, and, are, therefore, called, motor, impulses, some, are, secretory, and, enter, glands, a, portion, are, inhibitory, their, function, being, to, restrain, secretion, thus, nerves, carry, impulses, outward, and, sensations, inward, the, activity, of, these, nerves, or, rather, their, fibers, may, become, excited, or, allayed, by, impingement, the, result, being, a, modification, of, functionality, too, much, or, not, enough, action, which, is, disease, vertebral, subluxation, a, core, concept, of, traditional, chiropractic, remains, unsubstantiated, and, largely, untested, and, a, debate, about, whether, to, keep, it, in, the, chiropractic, paradigm, has, been, ongoing, for, decades, in, general, critics, of, traditional, subluxation, based, chiropractic, including, chiropractors, are, skeptical, of, its, clinical, value, dogmatic, beliefs, and, metaphysical, approach, while, straight, chiropractic, still, retains, the, traditional, vitalistic, construct, espoused, by, the, founders, evidence, based, chiropractic, suggests, that, a, mechanistic, view, will, allow, chiropractic, care, to, become, integrated, into, the, wider, health, care, community, this, is, still, a, continuing, source, of, debate, within, the, chiropractic, profession, as, well, with, some, schools, of, chiropractic, still, teaching, the, traditional, straight, subluxation, based, chiropractic, while, others, have, moved, towards, an, evidence, based, chiropractic, that, rejects, metaphysical, foundings, and, limits, itself, to, primarily, neuromusculoskeletal, conditions, in, 2005, the, chiropractic, subluxation, was, defined, by, the, world, health, organization, as, a, lesion, or, dysfunction, in, a, joint, or, motion, segment, in, which, alignment, movement, integrity, and, or, physiological, function, are, altered, although, contact, between, joint, surfaces, remains, intact, it, is, essentially, a, functional, entity, which, may, influence, biomechanical, and, neural, integrity, this, differs, from, the, medical, definition, of, subluxation, as, a, significant, structural, displacement, which, can, be, seen, with, static, imaging, techniques, such, as, x, rays, the, use, of, x, ray, imaging, in, the, case, of, vertebral, subluxation, exposes, patients, to, harmful, ionizing, radiation, for, no, evidentially, supported, reason, the, 2008, book, trick, or, treatment, states, x, rays, can, reveal, neither, the, subluxations, nor, the, innate, intelligence, associated, with, chiropractic, philosophy, because, they, do, not, exist, attorney, david, chapman, smith, secretary, general, of, the, world, federation, of, chiropractic, has, stated, that, medical, critics, have, asked, how, there, can, be, a, subluxation, if, it, cannot, be, seen, on, x, ray, the, answer, is, that, the, chiropractic, subluxation, is, essentially, a, functional, entity, not, structural, and, is, therefore, no, more, visible, on, static, x, ray, than, a, limp, or, headache, or, any, other, functional, problem, the, general, chiropractic, council, the, statutory, regulatory, body, for, chiropractors, in, the, united, kingdom, states, that, the, chiropractic, vertebral, subluxation, complex, is, not, supported, by, any, clinical, research, evidence, that, would, allow, claims, to, be, made, that, it, is, the, cause, of, disease, as, of, 2014, the, us, national, board, of, chiropractic, examiners, states, the, specific, focus, of, chiropractic, practice, is, known, as, the, chiropractic, subluxation, or, joint, dysfunction, a, subluxation, is, a, health, concern, that, manifests, in, the, skeletal, joints, and, through, complex, anatomical, and, physiological, relationships, affects, the, nervous, system, and, may, lead, to, reduced, function, disability, or, illness, while, some, chiropractors, limit, their, practice, to, short, term, treatment, of, musculoskeletal, conditions, many, falsely, claim, to, be, able, treat, a, myriad, of, other, conditions, some, dissuade, patients, from, seeking, medical, care, others, have, pretended, to, be, qualified, to, act, as, a, family, doctor, quackwatch, an, alternative, medicine, watchdog, cautions, against, seeing, chiropractors, who, writing, for, the, skeptical, inquirer, one, physician, cautioned, against, seeing, even, chiropractors, who, solely, claim, to, treat, musculoskeletal, conditions, i, think, spinal, manipulation, therapy, smt, is, a, reasonable, option, for, patients, to, try, but, i, could, not, in, good, conscience, refer, a, patient, to, a, chiropractor, when, chiropractic, is, effective, what, is, effective, is, not, chiropractic, it, is, smt, smt, is, also, offered, by, physical, therapists, dos, and, others, these, are, science, based, providers, if, i, thought, a, patient, might, benefit, from, manipulation, i, would, rather, refer, him, or, her, to, a, science, based, provider, chiropractors, emphasize, the, conservative, management, of, the, neuromusculoskeletal, system, without, the, use, of, medicines, or, surgery, with, special, emphasis, on, the, spine, back, and, neck, pain, are, the, specialties, of, chiropractic, but, many, chiropractors, treat, ailments, other, than, musculoskeletal, issues, there, is, a, range, of, opinions, among, chiropractors, some, believed, that, treatment, should, be, confined, to, the, spine, or, back, and, neck, pain, others, disagreed, for, example, while, one, 2009, survey, of, american, chiropractors, had, found, that, 73, classified, themselves, as, back, pain, musculoskeletal, specialists, the, label, back, and, neck, pain, specialists, was, regarded, by, 47, of, them, as, a, least, desirable, description, in, a, 2005, international, survey, chiropractic, combines, aspects, from, mainstream, and, alternative, medicine, and, there, is, no, agreement, about, how, to, define, the, profession, although, chiropractors, have, many, attributes, of, primary, care, providers, chiropractic, has, more, attributes, of, a, medical, specialty, like, dentistry, or, podiatry, it, has, been, proposed, that, chiropractors, specialize, in, nonsurgical, spine, care, instead, of, attempting, to, also, treat, other, problems, but, the, more, expansive, view, of, chiropractic, is, still, widespread, mainstream, health, care, and, governmental, organizations, such, as, the, world, health, organization, consider, chiropractic, to, be, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, cam, and, a, 2008, study, reported, that, 31, of, surveyed, chiropractors, categorized, chiropractic, as, cam, 27, as, integrated, medicine, and, 12, as, mainstream, medicine, many, chiropractors, believe, they, are, primary, care, providers, including, us, and, uk, chiropractors, but, the, length, breadth, and, depth, of, chiropractic, clinical, training, do, not, support, the, requirements, to, be, considered, primary, care, providers, so, their, role, on, primary, care, is, limited, and, disputed, chiropractic, overlaps, with, several, other, forms, of, manual, therapy, including, massage, therapy, osteopathy, physical, therapy, and, sports, medicine, chiropractic, is, autonomous, from, and, competitive, with, mainstream, medicine, and, osteopathy, outside, the, us, remains, primarily, a, manual, medical, system, physical, therapists, work, alongside, and, cooperate, with, mainstream, medicine, and, osteopathic, medicine, in, the, u, s, has, merged, with, the, medical, profession, practitioners, may, distinguish, these, competing, approaches, through, claims, that, compared, to, other, therapists, chiropractors, heavily, emphasize, spinal, manipulation, tend, to, use, firmer, manipulative, techniques, and, promote, maintenance, care, that, osteopaths, use, a, wider, variety, of, treatment, procedures, and, that, physical, therapists, emphasize, machinery, and, exercise, chiropractic, diagnosis, may, involve, a, range, of, methods, including, skeletal, imaging, observational, and, tactile, assessments, and, orthopedic, and, neurological, evaluation, a, chiropractor, may, also, refer, a, patient, to, an, appropriate, specialist, or, co, manage, with, another, health, care, provider, common, patient, management, involves, spinal, manipulation, sm, and, other, manual, therapies, to, the, joints, and, soft, tissues, rehabilitative, exercises, health, promotion, electrical, modalities, complementary, procedures, and, lifestyle, advice, chiropractors, are, not, normally, licensed, to, write, medical, prescriptions, or, perform, major, surgery, in, the, united, states, although, new, mexico, has, become, the, first, us, state, to, allow, advanced, practice, trained, chiropractors, to, prescribe, certain, medications, in, the, us, their, scope, of, practice, varies, by, state, based, on, inconsistent, views, of, chiropractic, care, some, states, such, as, iowa, broadly, allow, treatment, of, human, ailments, some, such, as, delaware, use, vague, concepts, such, as, transition, of, nerve, energy, to, define, scope, of, practice, others, such, as, new, jersey, specify, a, severely, narrowed, scope, us, states, also, differ, over, whether, chiropractors, may, conduct, laboratory, tests, or, diagnostic, procedures, dispense, dietary, supplements, or, use, other, therapies, such, as, homeopathy, and, acupuncture, in, oregon, they, can, become, certified, to, perform, minor, surgery, and, to, deliver, children, via, natural, childbirth, a, 2003, survey, of, north, american, chiropractors, found, that, a, slight, majority, favored, allowing, them, to, write, prescriptions, for, over, the, counter, drugs, a, 2010, survey, found, that, 72, of, swiss, chiropractors, considered, their, ability, to, prescribe, nonprescription, medication, as, an, advantage, for, chiropractic, treatment, a, related, field, veterinary, chiropractic, applies, manual, therapies, to, animals, and, is, recognized, in, many, us, states, but, is, not, recognized, by, the, american, chiropractic, association, as, being, chiropractic, it, remains, controversial, within, certain, segments, of, the, veterinary, and, chiropractic, professions, no, single, profession, owns, spinal, manipulation, and, there, is, little, consensus, as, to, which, profession, should, administer, sm, raising, concerns, by, chiropractors, that, other, medical, physicians, could, steal, sm, procedures, from, chiropractors, a, focus, on, evidence, based, sm, research, has, also, raised, concerns, that, the, resulting, practice, guidelines, could, limit, the, scope, of, chiropractic, practice, to, treating, backs, and, necks, two, us, states, washington, and, arkansas, prohibit, physical, therapists, from, performing, sm, some, states, allow, them, to, do, it, only, if, they, have, completed, advanced, training, in, sm, and, some, states, allow, only, chiropractors, to, perform, sm, or, only, chiropractors, and, physicians, bills, to, further, prohibit, non, chiropractors, from, performing, sm, are, regularly, introduced, into, state, legislatures, and, are, opposed, by, physical, therapist, organizations, spinal, manipulation, which, chiropractors, call, spinal, adjustment, or, chiropractic, adjustment, is, the, most, common, treatment, used, in, chiropractic, care, spinal, manipulation, is, a, passive, manual, maneuver, during, which, a, three, joint, complex, is, taken, past, the, normal, range, of, movement, but, not, so, far, as, to, dislocate, or, damage,

have, been, used, to, generate, practice, guidelines, outlining, standards, that, specify, which, chiropractic, treatments, are, legitimate, i, e, supported, by, evidence, and, conceivably, reimbursable, under, managed, care, health, payment, systems, evidence, based, guidelines, are, supported, by, one, end, of, an, ideological, continuum, among, chiropractors, the, other, end, employs, antiscientific, reasoning, and, makes, unsubstantiated, claims, chiropractic, remains, at, a, crossroads, and, that, in, order, to, progress, it, would, need, to, embrace, science, the, promotion, by, some, for, it, to, be, a, cure, all, was, both, misguided, and, irrational, a, 2007, survey, of, alberta, chiropractors, found, that, they, do, not, consistently, apply, research, in, practice, which, may, have, resulted, from, a, lack, of, research, education, and, skills, specific, guidelines, concerning, the, treatment, of, nonspecific, i, e, unknown, cause, low, back, pain, are, inconsistent, between, countries, numerous, controlled, clinical, studies, of, treatments, used, by, chiropractors, have, been, conducted, with, varied, results, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, that, chiropractic, manipulative, treatment, is, effective, for, the, treatment, of, any, medical, condition, except, perhaps, for, certain, kinds, of, back, pain, generally, the, research, carried, out, into, the, effectiveness, of, chiropractic, has, been, of, poor, quality, research, published, by, chiropractors, is, distinctly, biased, reviews, of, sm, for, back, pain, tended, to, find, positive, conclusions, when, authored, by, chiropractors, while, reviews, by, mainstream, authors, did, not, there, is, a, wide, range, of, ways, to, measure, treatment, outcomes, chiropractic, care, benefits, from, the, placebo, response, but, it, is, difficult, to, construct, a, trustworthy, placebo, for, clinical, trials, of, spinal, manipulative, therapy, smt, the, efficacy, of, maintenance, care, in, chiropractic, is, unknown, available, evidence, covers, the, following, conditions, the, world, health, organization, found, chiropractic, care, in, general, is, safe, when, employed, skillfully, and, appropriately, there, is, not, sufficient, data, to, establish, the, safety, of, chiropractic, manipulations, manipulation, is, regarded, as, relatively, safe, but, complications, can, arise, and, it, has, known, adverse, effects, risks, and, contraindications, absolute, contraindications, to, spinal, manipulative, therapy, are, conditions, that, should, not, be, manipulated, these, contraindications, include, rheumatoid, arthritis, and, conditions, known, to, result, in, unstable, joints, relative, contraindications, are, conditions, where, increased, risk, is, acceptable, in, some, situations, and, where, low, force, and, soft, tissue, techniques, are, treatments, of, choice, these, contraindications, include, osteoporosis, although, most, contraindications, apply, only, to, manipulation, of, the, affected, region, some, neurological, signs, indicate, referral, to, emergency, medical, services, these, include, sudden, and, severe, headache, or, neck, pain, unlike, that, previously, experienced, indirect, risks, of, chiropractic, involve, delayed, or, missed, diagnoses, through, consulting, a, chiropractor, spinal, manipulation, is, associated, with, frequent, mild, and, temporary, adverse, effects, including, new, or, worsening, pain, or, stiffness, in, the, affected, region, they, have, been, estimated, to, occur, in, 33, to, 61, of, patients, and, frequently, occur, within, an, hour, of, treatment, and, disappear, within, 24, to, 48, hours, adverse, reactions, appear, to, be, more, common, following, manipulation, than, mobilization, the, most, frequently, stated, adverse, effects, are, mild, headache, soreness, and, briefly, elevated, pain, fatigue, chiropractic, is, correlated, with, a, very, high, incidence, of, minor, adverse, effects, rarely, spinal, manipulation, particularly, on, the, upper, spine, can, also, result, in, complications, that, can, lead, to, permanent, disability, or, death, these, can, occur, in, adults, and, children, estimates, vary, widely, for, the, incidence, of, these, complications, and, the, actual, incidence, is, unknown, due, to, high, levels, of, underreporting, and, to, the, difficulty, of, linking, manipulation, to, adverse, effects, such, as, stroke, which, is, a, particular, concern, adverse, effects, are, poorly, reported, in, recent, studies, investigating, chiropractic, manipulations, a, 2016, systematic, review, concludes, that, the, level, of, reporting, is, unsuitable, and, unacceptable, reports, of, serious, adverse, events, have, occurred, resulting, from, spinal, manipulation, therapy, of, the, lumbopelvic, region, estimates, for, serious, adverse, events, vary, from, 5, strokes, per, 100, 000, manipulations, to, 1, 46, serious, adverse, events, per, 10, million, manipulations, and, 2, 68, deaths, per, 10, million, manipulations, though, it, was, determined, that, there, was, inadequate, data, to, be, conclusive, several, case, reports, show, temporal, associations, between, interventions, and, potentially, serious, complications, the, published, medical, literature, contains, reports, of, 26, deaths, since, 1934, following, chiropractic, manipulations, and, many, more, seem, to, remain, unpublished, vertebrobasilar, artery, stroke, vas, is, statistically, associated, with, chiropractic, services, in, persons, under, 45, years, of, age, but, it, is, similarly, associated, with, general, practitioner, services, suggesting, that, these, associations, are, likely, explained, by, preexisting, conditions, weak, to, moderately, strong, evidence, supports, causation, as, opposed, to, statistical, association, between, cervical, manipulative, therapy, cmt, and, vas, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, support, a, strong, association, or, no, association, between, cervical, manipulation, and, stroke, while, the, biomechanical, evidence, is, not, sufficient, to, support, the, statement, that, cmt, causes, cervical, artery, dissection, cd, clinical, reports, suggest, that, mechanical, forces, have, a, part, in, a, substantial, number, of, cds, and, the, majority, of, population, controlled, studies, found, an, association, between, cmt, and, vas, in, young, people, it, is, strongly, recommended, that, practitioners, consider, the, plausibility, of, cd, as, a, symptom, and, people, can, be, informed, of, the, association, between, cd, and, cmt, before, administering, manipulation, of, the, cervical, spine, there, is, controversy, regarding, the, degree, of, risk, of, stroke, from, cervical, manipulation, many, chiropractors, state, that, the, association, between, chiropractic, therapy, and, vertebral, arterial, dissection, is, not, proven, however, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, causality, between, chiropractic, cervical, manipulation, beyond, the, normal, range, of, motion, and, vascular, accidents, is, probable, or, definite, there, is, very, low, evidence, supporting, a, small, association, between, internal, carotid, artery, dissection, and, chiropractic, neck, manipulation, the, incidence, of, internal, carotid, artery, dissection, following, cervical, spine, manipulation, is, unknown, the, literature, infrequently, reports, helpful, data, to, better, understand, the, association, between, cervical, manipulative, therapy, cervical, artery, dissection, and, stroke, the, limited, evidence, is, inconclusive, that, chiropractic, spinal, manipulation, therapy, is, not, a, cause, of, intracranial, hypotension, cervical, intradural, disc, herniation, is, very, rare, following, spinal, manipulation, therapy, chiropractors, sometimes, employ, diagnostic, imaging, techniques, such, as, x, rays, and, ct, scans, that, rely, on, ionizing, radiation, although, there, is, no, clear, evidence, to, justify, the, practice, some, chiropractors, still, x, ray, a, patient, several, times, a, year, practice, guidelines, aim, to, reduce, unnecessary, radiation, exposure, which, increases, cancer, risk, in, proportion, to, the, amount, of, radiation, received, research, suggests, that, radiology, instruction, given, at, chiropractic, schools, worldwide, seem, to, be, evidence, based, although, there, seems, to, be, a, disparity, between, some, schools, and, available, evidence, regarding, the, aspect, of, radiography, for, patients, with, acute, low, back, pain, without, an, indication, of, a, serious, disease, which, may, contribute, to, chiropractic, overuse, of, radiography, for, low, back, pain, a, 2012, systematic, review, concluded, that, no, accurate, assessment, of, risk, benefit, exists, for, cervical, manipulation, a, 2010, systematic, review, stated, that, there, is, no, good, evidence, to, assume, that, neck, manipulation, is, an, effective, treatment, for, any, medical, condition, and, suggested, a, precautionary, principle, in, healthcare, for, chiropractic, intervention, even, if, a, causality, with, vertebral, artery, dissection, after, neck, manipulation, were, merely, a, remote, possibility, the, same, review, concluded, that, the, risk, of, death, from, manipulations, to, the, neck, outweighs, the, benefits, chiropractors, have, criticized, this, conclusion, claiming, that, the, author, did, not, evaluate, the, potential, benefits, of, spinal, manipulation, edzard, ernst, stated, this, detail, was, not, the, subject, of, my, review, i, do, however, refer, to, such, evaluations, and, should, add, that, a, report, recently, commissioned, by, the, general, chiropractic, council, did, not, support, many, of, the, outlandish, claims, made, by, many, chiropractors, across, the, world, a, 1999, review, of, 177, previously, reported, cases, published, between, 1925, and, 1997, in, which, injuries, were, attributed, to, manipulation, of, the, cervical, spine, mcs, concluded, that, the, literature, does, not, demonstrate, that, the, benefits, of, mcs, outweigh, the, risks, the, professions, associated, with, each, injury, were, assessed, physical, therapists, pt, were, involved, in, less, than, 2, of, all, cases, with, no, deaths, caused, by, pts, chiropractors, were, involved, in, a, little, more, than, 60, of, all, cases, including, 32, deaths, a, 2009, review, evaluating, maintenance, chiropractic, care, found, that, spinal, manipulation, is, associated, with, considerable, harm, and, no, compelling, evidence, exists, to, indicate, that, it, adequately, prevents, symptoms, or, diseases, thus, the, risk, benefit, is, not, evidently, favorable, a, 2012, systematic, review, suggested, that, the, use, of, spine, manipulation, in, clinical, practice, is, a, cost, effective, treatment, when, used, alone, or, in, combination, with, other, treatment, approaches, a, 2011, systematic, review, found, evidence, supporting, the, cost, effectiveness, of, using, spinal, manipulation, for, the, treatment, of, sub, acute, or, chronic, low, back, pain, the, results, for, acute, low, back, pain, were, insufficient, a, 2006, systematic, cost, effectiveness, review, found, that, the, reported, cost, effectiveness, of, spinal, manipulation, in, the, united, kingdom, compared, favorably, with, other, treatments, for, back, pain, but, that, reports, were, based, on, data, from, clinical, trials, without, placebo, controls, and, that, the, specific, cost, effectiveness, of, the, treatment, as, opposed, to, non, specific, effects, remains, uncertain, a, 2005, american, systematic, review, of, economic, evaluations, of, conservative, treatments, for, low, back, pain, found, that, significant, quality, problems, in, available, studies, meant, that, definite, conclusions, could, not, be, drawn, about, the, most, cost, effective, intervention, the, cost, effectiveness, of, maintenance, chiropractic, care, is, unknown, analysis, of, a, clinical, and, cost, utilization, data, from, the, years, 2003, to, 2005, by, an, integrative, medicine, independent, physician,

care, and, most, hmos, cover, these, services, chiropractic, s, origins, lie, in, the, folk, medicine, practice, of, bonesetting, in, which, untrained, practitioners, engaged, in, joint, manipulation, or, resetting, fractured, bones, chiropractic, was, founded, in, 1895, by, daniel, david, d, d, palmer, in, davenport, iowa, palmer, a, magnetic, healer, hypothesized, that, manual, manipulation, of, the, spine, could, cure, disease, the, first, chiropractic, patient, of, d, d, palmer, was, harvey, lillard, a, worker, in, the, building, where, palmer, s, office, was, located, he, claimed, that, he, had, severely, reduced, hearing, for, 17, years, which, started, shortly, following, a, pop, in, his, spine, a, few, days, following, his, adjustment, lillard, claimed, his, hearing, was, almost, completely, restored, another, of, palmer, s, patients, samuel, weed, coined, the, term, chiropractic, from, greek, chiro, hand, itself, from, cheir, hand, and, praktikos, practical, chiropractic, is, classified, as, a, field, of, pseudomedicine, on, account, of, its, esoteric, origins, chiropractic, competed, with, its, predecessor, osteopathy, another, medical, system, based, on, magnetic, healing, both, systems, were, founded, by, charismatic, midwesterners, in, opposition, to, the, conventional, medicine, of, the, day, and, both, postulated, that, manipulation, improved, health, although, initially, keeping, chiropractic, a, family, secret, in, 1898, palmer, began, teaching, it, to, a, few, students, at, his, new, palmer, school, of, chiropractic, one, student, his, son, bartlett, joshua, b, j, palmer, became, committed, to, promoting, chiropractic, took, over, the, palmer, school, in, 1906, and, rapidly, expanded, its, enrollment, early, chiropractors, believed, that, all, disease, was, caused, by, interruptions, in, the, flow, of, innate, intelligence, a, vitalistic, nervous, energy, or, life, force, that, represented, god, s, presence, in, man, chiropractic, leaders, often, invoked, religious, imagery, and, moral, traditions, d, d, palmer, said, he, received, chiropractic, from, the, other, world, d, d, and, b, j, both, seriously, considered, declaring, chiropractic, a, religion, which, might, have, provided, legal, protection, under, the, u, s, constitution, but, decided, against, it, partly, to, avoid, confusion, with, christian, science, early, chiropractors, also, tapped, into, the, populist, movement, emphasizing, craft, hard, work, competition, and, advertisement, aligning, themselves, with, the, common, man, against, intellectuals, and, trusts, among, which, they, included, the, american, medical, association, ama, chiropractic, has, seen, considerable, controversy, and, criticism, although, d, d, and, b, j, were, straight, and, disdained, the, use, of, instruments, some, early, chiropractors, whom, b, j, scornfully, called, mixers, advocated, the, use, of, instruments, in, 1910, b, j, changed, course, and, endorsed, x, rays, as, necessary, for, diagnosis, this, resulted, in, a, significant, exodus, from, the, palmer, school, of, the, more, conservative, faculty, and, students, the, mixer, camp, grew, until, by, 1924, b, j, estimated, that, only, 3, 000, of, the, united, states, 25, 000, chiropractors, remained, straight, that, year, b, j, s, invention, and, promotion, of, the, neurocalometer, a, temperature, sensing, device, was, highly, controversial, among, b, j, s, fellow, straights, by, the, 1930s, chiropractic, was, the, largest, alternative, healing, profession, in, the, u, s, chiropractors, faced, heavy, opposition, from, organized, medicine, d, d, palmer, was, jailed, in, 1907, for, practicing, medicine, without, a, license, thousands, of, chiropractors, were, prosecuted, for, practicing, medicine, without, a, license, and, d, d, and, many, other, chiropractors, were, jailed, to, defend, against, medical, statutes, b, j, argued, that, chiropractic, was, separate, and, distinct, from, medicine, asserting, that, chiropractors, analyzed, rather, than, diagnosed, and, adjusted, subluxations, rather, than, treated, disease, b, j, cofounded, the, universal, chiropractors, association, uca, to, provide, legal, services, to, arrested, chiropractors, although, the, uca, won, their, first, test, case, in, wisconsin, in, 1907, prosecutions, instigated, by, state, medical, boards, became, increasingly, common, and, in, many, cases, were, successful, in, response, chiropractors, conducted, political, campaigns, to, secure, separate, licensing, statutes, eventually, succeeding, in, all, fifty, states, from, kansas, in, 1913, through, louisiana, in, 1974, the, longstanding, feud, between, chiropractors, and, medical, doctors, continued, for, decades, the, ama, labeled, chiropractic, an, unscientific, cult, in, 1966, and, until, 1980, advised, its, members, that, it, was, unethical, for, medical, doctors, to, associate, with, unscientific, practitioners, this, culminated, in, a, landmark, 1987, decision, wilk, v, ama, in, which, the, court, found, that, the, ama, had, engaged, in, unreasonable, restraint, of, trade, and, conspiracy, and, which, ended, the, ama, s, de, facto, boycott, of, chiropractic, serious, research, to, test, chiropractic, theories, did, not, begin, until, the, 1970s, and, is, continuing, to, be, hampered, by, antiscientific, and, pseudoscientific, ideas, that, sustained, the, profession, in, its, long, battle, with, organized, medicine, by, the, mid, 1990s, there, was, a, growing, scholarly, interest, in, chiropractic, which, helped, efforts, to, improve, service, quality, and, establish, clinical, guidelines, that, recommended, manual, therapies, for, acute, low, back, pain, in, recent, decades, chiropractic, gained, legitimacy, and, greater, acceptance, by, medical, physicians, and, health, plans, and, enjoyed, a, strong, political, base, and, sustained, demand, for, services, however, its, future, seemed, uncertain, as, the, number, of, practitioners, grew, evidence, based, medicine, insisted, on, treatments, with, demonstrated, value, managed, care, restricted, payment, and, competition, grew, from, massage, therapists, and, other, health, professions, the, profession, responded, by, marketing, natural, products, and, devices, more, aggressively, and, by, reaching, deeper, into, alternative, medicine, and, primary, care, some, chiropractors, oppose, vaccination, and, water, fluoridation, which, are, common, public, health, practices, within, the, chiropractic, community, there, are, significant, disagreements, about, vaccination, one, of, the, most, cost, effective, public, health, interventions, available, most, chiropractic, writings, on, vaccination, focus, on, its, negative, aspects, claiming, that, it, is, hazardous, ineffective, and, unnecessary, some, chiropractors, have, embraced, vaccination, but, a, significant, portion, of, the, profession, rejects, it, as, original, chiropractic, philosophy, traces, diseases, to, causes, in, the, spine, and, states, that, vaccines, interfere, with, healing, the, extent, to, which, anti, vaccination, views, perpetuate, the, current, chiropractic, profession, is, uncertain, the, american, chiropractic, association, and, the, international, chiropractors, association, support, individual, exemptions, to, compulsory, vaccination, laws, and, a, 1995, survey, of, u, s, chiropractors, found, that, about, a, third, believed, there, was, no, scientific, proof, that, immunization, prevents, disease, the, canadian, chiropractic, association, supports, vaccination, a, survey, in, alberta, in, 2002, found, that, 25, of, chiropractors, advised, patients, for, and, 27, against, vaccinating, themselves, or, their, children, early, opposition, to, water, fluoridation, included, chiropractors, some, of, whom, continue, to, oppose, it, as, being, incompatible, with, chiropractic, philosophy, and, an, infringement, of, personal, freedom, other, chiropractors, have, actively, promoted, fluoridation, and, several, chiropractic, organizations, have, endorsed, scientific, principles, of, public, health, in, addition, to, traditional, chiropractic, opposition, to, water, fluoridation, and, vaccination, chiropractors, attempts, to, establish, a, positive, reputation, for, their, public, health, role, are, also, compromised, by, their, reputation, for, recommending, repetitive, lifelong, chiropractic, treatment, throughout, its, history, chiropractic, has, been, the, subject, of, internal, and, external, controversy, and, criticism, according, to, daniel, d, palmer, the, founder, of, chiropractic, subluxation, is, the, sole, cause, of, disease, and, manipulation, is, the, cure, for, all, diseases, of, the, human, race, a, 2003, profession, wide, survey, found, most, chiropractors, whether, straights, or, mixers, still, hold, views, of, innate, intelligence, and, of, the, cause, and, cure, of, disease, not, just, back, pain, consistent, with, those, of, the, palmers, a, critical, evaluation, stated, chiropractic, is, rooted, in, mystical, concepts, this, led, to, an, internal, conflict, within, the, chiropractic, profession, which, continues, today, chiropractors, including, d, d, palmer, were, jailed, for, practicing, medicine, without, a, license, for, most, of, its, existence, chiropractic, has, battled, with, mainstream, medicine, sustained, by, antiscientific, and, pseudoscientific, ideas, such, as, subluxation, collectively, systematic, reviews, have, not, demonstrated, that, spinal, manipulation, the, main, treatment, method, employed, by, chiropractors, is, effective, for, any, medical, condition, with, the, possible, exception, of, treatment, for, back, pain, chiropractic, remains, controversial, though, to, a, lesser, extent, than, in, past, years
