box, turtle, is, the, common, name, for, several, species, of, turtle, it, may, refer, to, those, of, the, genus, cuora, or, pyxidea, which, are, the, asian, box, turtles, or, more, commonly, to, species, of, the, genus, terrapene, the, north, american, box, turtles, they, are, largely, characterized, by, having, a, shell, shaped, like, a, dome, which, is, hinged, at, the, bottom, allowing, the, animal, to, close, its, shell, tightly, to, escape, predators, furthermore, the, two, genera, are, very, different, in, habitat, behavior, and, appearance, and, are, not, even, classified, in, the, same, family, even, though, box, turtles, became, very, popular, pets, their, needs, in, captivity, are, complex, and, the, capture, of, turtles, can, have, serious, detrimental, effects, on, the, wild, population, the, box, turtle, commonly, lives, over, twenty, years, with, verified, cases, of, lifespans, exceeding, 40, to, 50, years, there, have, been, unverified, cases, of, box, turtles, living, for, a, hundred, years, and, more, box, turtles, are, omnivorous, their, eagle, eyes, and, keen, sense, of, smell, help, them, find, foods, such, as, snails, insects, berries, fungi, slugs, worms, flowers, fish, frogs, salamanders, various, rodents, snakes, birds, eggs, among, other, things, during, their, first, five, to, six, years, of, life, they, are, primarily, carnivorous, adults, tend, to, be, mostly, herbivores, but, do, not, feed, on, leafy, greens, box, turtles, are, known, to, feed, on, animals, found, dead, on, roadways, victims, of, being, struck, by, a, car, or, other, rolling, vehicle, hatchlings, and, young, turtles, need, more, protein, and, prefer, a, carnivorous, diet, to, which, as, they, grow, they, incorporate, more, and, more, plants, a, recent, study, conducted, by, davidson, college, revealed, among, other, things, that, a, box, turtle, can, make, sounds, with, its, jaws, that, exceed, 75, db, this, sound, can, be, used, to, scare, away, predators, and, even, also, as, some, kind, of, mating, call, while, it, appears, that, most, matings, of, terrapene, carolina, occur, in, one, on, one, encounters, there, are, occasions, when, two, males, will, compete, for, access, to, the, same, female, these, encounters, which, almost, never, amount, to, mortal, combat, consist, of, head, butting, shoving, and, perhaps, attempts, to, overturn, the, other, it, is, presumed, that, eventually, one, of, the, males, exhausts, himself, and, withdraws, from, the, field, while, the, other, gains, access, to, the, female, mating, occurs, during, nesting, season, beginning, in, the, late, boreal, spring, and, ceasing, at, the, end, of, the, summer, months, asian, box, turtles, are, in, serious, danger, of, extinction, in, their, habitat, because, they, are, part, of, the, food, base, of, many, asian, countries, such, as, china, where, they, are, captured, for, local, food, markets, despite, captive, breeding, farms, north, american, box, turtles, on, the, other, hand, are, endangered, by, habitat, destruction, the, forests, converted, to, farmland, greatly, reduced, the, number, of, turtles, in, many, states, the, remaining, land, is, often, fragmented, with, highways, and, urban, projects, destroying, the, animals, habitat, in, an, attempt, to, cross, man, made, additions, turtles, are, often, killed, by, cars, animals, and, other, hazards, they, are, also, facing, population, decline, from, a, necrotizing, bacterial, infection, first, found, in, this, species, april, 2011, another, serious, treatment, of, these, animals, in, north, america, is, the, capture, and, sale, of, hatchling, box, turtles, from, the, wild, a, 3, year, study, conducted, in, texas, indicated, that, more, than, 7000, box, turtles, were, taken, from, the, wild, for, commercial, trade, a, similar, study, in, louisiana, found, that, over, a, 41, month, period, about, 30, 000, box, turtles, were, taken, from, the, wild, for, resale, once, captured, the, turtles, are, often, kept, in, poor, conditions, in, which, more, than, half, die, those, that, live, long, enough, to, be, sold, usually, suffer, from, conditions, such, as, malnutrition, dehydration, and, infection, indiana, and, many, other, states, created, strict, laws, against, the, collection, of, hatchling, turtles, from, the, wild, in, many, states, it, is, illegal, to, keep, them, without, a, special, permit, collecting, wild, hatched, box, turtles, can, cause, irreversible, damage, to, populations, because, these, turtles, have, a, low, reproductive, rate, as, they, take, a, long, time, to, find, a, mate, most, turtle, and, sea, turtle, societies, do, not, recommend, the, use, of, turtles, as, pets, for, young, children, despite, their, popularity, as, such, box, turtles, are, easily, stressed, if, touched, excessively, and, require, more, care, than, is, generally, thought, box, turtles, can, be, easily, injured, by, dogs, and, cats, so, special, care, must, be, taken, to, protect, them, from, household, pets, and, neighborhood, animals, box, turtles, require, an, enclosed, outdoor, location, consistent, sun, exposure, and, a, varied, diet, without, this, a, turtle, s, growth, can, be, stunted, and, its, immune, system, weakened, finding, box, turtles, in, the, wild, and, taking, them, as, pets, even, for, a, short, period, can, have, detrimental, effects, box, turtles, want, to, stay, within, the, area, where, they, were, hatched, if, one, is, moved, more, than, half, a, mile, from, its, territory, it, may, not, find, its, way, back, but, may, spend, years, searching, for, it, this, exposes, the, animal, to, danger, and, also, disrupts, the, breeding, cycle, of, which, it, would, otherwise, have, been, a, part, while, box, turtles, are, very, popular, as, pets, it, is, important, that, they, are, preserved, in, the, right, matter, keeping, them, in, a, more, northern, area, where, they, can, survive, the, best, in, ecological, and, physiological, factor, to, not, damage, their, way, of, living
