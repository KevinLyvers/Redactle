chromalveolata, was, a, eukaryote, supergroup, present, in, a, major, classification, of, 2005, then, regarded, as, one, of, the, six, major, groups, within, the, eukaryotes, it, was, a, refinement, of, the, kingdom, chromista, first, proposed, by, thomas, cavalier, smith, in, 1981, chromalveolata, was, proposed, to, represent, the, organisms, descended, from, a, single, secondary, endosymbiosis, involving, a, red, alga, and, a, bikont, the, plastids, in, these, organisms, are, those, that, contain, chlorophyll, c, however, the, monophyly, of, the, chromalveolata, has, been, rejected, thus, two, papers, published, in, 2008, have, phylogenetic, trees, in, which, the, chromalveolates, are, split, up, and, recent, studies, continue, to, support, this, view, historically, many, chromalveolates, were, considered, plants, because, of, their, cell, walls, photosynthetic, ability, and, in, some, cases, their, morphological, resemblance, to, the, land, plants, embryophyta, however, when, the, five, kingdom, system, proposed, in, 1969, took, prevalence, over, the, animal, plant, dichotomy, most, of, what, we, now, call, chromalveolates, were, put, into, the, kingdom, protista, but, the, water, molds, and, slime, nets, were, put, into, the, kingdom, fungi, while, the, brown, algae, stayed, in, the, plant, kingdom, these, various, organisms, were, later, grouped, together, and, given, the, name, chromalveolata, by, cavalier, smith, he, believed, them, to, be, a, monophyletic, group, but, this, is, not, the, case, in, 2005, in, a, classification, reflecting, the, consensus, at, the, time, the, chromalveolata, were, regarded, as, one, of, the, six, major, clades, of, eukaryotes, although, not, given, a, formal, taxonomic, status, in, this, classification, elsewhere, the, group, had, been, treated, as, a, kingdom, the, chromalveolata, were, divided, into, four, major, subgroups, other, groups, that, may, be, included, within, or, related, to, chromalveolates, are, though, several, groups, such, as, the, ciliates, and, the, water, molds, have, lost, the, ability, to, photosynthesize, most, are, autotrophic, all, photosynthetic, chromalveolates, use, chlorophylls, a, and, c, and, many, use, accessory, pigments, chromalveolates, share, similar, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, dehydrogenase, proteins, however, as, early, as, 2005, doubts, were, being, expressed, as, to, whether, chromalveolata, was, monophyletic, and, a, review, in, 2006, noted, the, lack, of, evidence, for, several, of, the, supposed, six, major, eukaryote, groups, including, the, chromalveolata, in, 2012, consensus, emerged, that, the, group, is, not, monophyletic, the, four, original, subgroups, fall, into, at, least, two, categories, one, comprises, the, stramenopiles, and, the, alveolata, to, which, the, rhizaria, are, now, usually, added, to, form, the, sar, group, the, other, comprises, the, cryptophyta, and, the, haptophyta, a, 2010, paper, splits, the, cryptophyta, and, haptophyta, the, former, are, a, sister, group, to, the, sar, group, the, latter, cluster, with, the, archaeplastida, plants, in, the, broad, sense, the, katablepharids, are, closely, related, to, the, cryptophytes, and, the, telonemids, and, centrohelids, may, be, related, to, the, haptophytes, a, variety, of, names, have, been, used, for, different, combinations, of, the, groups, formerly, thought, to, make, up, the, chromalveolata, chromalveolates, unlike, other, groups, with, multicellular, representatives, do, not, have, very, many, common, morphological, characteristics, each, major, subgroup, has, certain, unique, features, including, the, alveoli, of, the, alveolata, the, haptonema, of, the, haptophyta, the, ejectisome, of, the, cryptophyta, and, the, two, different, flagella, of, the, heterokontophyta, however, none, of, these, features, are, present, in, all, of, the, groups, the, only, common, chromalveolate, features, are, these, since, this, is, such, a, diverse, group, it, is, difficult, to, summarize, shared, chromalveolate, characteristics, many, chromalveolates, affect, our, ecosystem, in, enormous, ways, some, of, these, organisms, can, be, very, harmful, dinoflagellates, produce, red, tides, which, can, devastate, fish, populations, and, intoxicate, oyster, harvests, apicomplexans, are, some, of, the, most, successful, specific, parasites, to, animals, including, the, genus, plasmodium, the, malaria, parasites, water, molds, cause, several, plant, diseases, it, was, the, water, mold, phytophthora, infestans, that, caused, the, irish, potato, blight, that, led, to, the, great, irish, famine, however, many, others, are, vital, members, of, our, ecosystem, diatoms, are, one, of, the, major, photosynthetic, producers, and, as, such, produce, much, of, the, oxygen, that, we, breathe, and, also, take, in, much, of, the, carbon, dioxide, from, the, atmosphere, brown, algae, most, specifically, kelps, create, underwater, forest, habitats, for, many, marine, creatures, and, provide, a, large, portion, of, the, diet, of, coastal, communities, chromalveolates, also, provide, many, products, that, we, use, the, algin, in, brown, algae, is, used, as, a, food, thickener, most, famously, in, ice, cream, the, siliceous, shells, of, diatoms, have, many, uses, such, as, in, reflective, paint, in, toothpaste, or, as, a, filter, in, what, is, known, as, diatomaceous, earth, like, other, organisms, chromalveolata, have, viruses, in, the, case, of, emiliania, huxleyi, a, common, algal, bloom, chromalveolate, a, virus, believed, to, be, specific, to, it, causes, mass, death, and, the, end, of, the, bloom
