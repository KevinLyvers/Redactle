cypriniformes, s, p, r, n, f, r, m, i, z, is, an, order, of, ray, finned, fish, which, includes, many, families, and, genera, of, cyprinid, carps, and, their, kin, fish, such, as, barbs, gobies, loaches, botias, and, minnows, among, others, cypriniformes, is, an, order, within, an, order, placed, under, the, superorder, ostariophysi, which, is, also, made, up, of, cyprinid, ostariophysin, fishes, the, order, contains, 11, 12, families, with, some, authorities, having, listed, as, many, as, 23, over, 400, genera, and, more, than, 4, 250, named, species, new, species, are, regularly, described, and, new, genera, are, recognized, frequently, cyprinids, are, most, diverse, in, south, and, southeast, asia, but, are, entirely, absent, from, australia, and, south, america, at, 112, years, old, the, longest, lived, cypriniform, fish, documented, is, the, bigmouth, buffalo, their, closest, living, relatives, are, the, characiformes, characins, tetras, and, their, kin, the, gymnotiformes, electric, eel, and, american, knifefishes, and, the, siluriformes, catfishes, like, other, orders, of, the, ostariophysi, fishes, of, cypriniformes, possess, a, weberian, apparatus, they, differ, from, most, of, their, relatives, in, having, only, a, dorsal, fin, on, their, backs, most, other, fishes, of, ostariophysi, have, a, small, fleshy, adipose, fin, behind, the, dorsal, fin, other, differences, are, the, cypriniformes, unique, kinethmoid, a, small, median, bone, in, the, snout, and, the, lack, of, teeth, in, the, mouth, instead, they, have, convergent, structures, called, pharyngeal, teeth, in, the, throat, while, other, groups, of, fish, such, as, cichlids, also, possess, pharyngeal, teeth, the, cypriniformes, teeth, grind, against, a, chewing, pad, on, the, base, of, the, skull, rather, than, an, upper, pharyngeal, jaw, the, most, notable, family, placed, here, is, the, cyprinidae, carps, and, minnows, which, make, up, two, thirds, of, the, order, s, diversity, this, is, one, of, the, largest, families, of, fish, and, is, widely, distributed, across, africa, eurasia, and, north, america, most, species, are, strictly, freshwater, inhabitants, but, some, are, found, in, brackish, water, such, as, roach, and, bream, at, least, one, species, is, found, in, saltwater, the, pacific, redfin, tribolodon, brandtii, brackish, water, and, marine, cyprinids, are, invariably, anadromous, swimming, upstream, into, rivers, to, spawn, sometimes, separated, as, family, psilorhynchidae, they, seem, to, be, specially, adapted, fishes, of, the, cyprinidae, the, balitoridae, and, gyrinocheilidae, are, families, of, mountain, stream, fishes, feeding, on, algae, and, small, invertebrates, they, are, found, only, in, tropical, and, subtropical, asia, while, the, former, are, a, speciose, group, the, latter, contain, only, a, handful, of, species, the, suckers, catostomidae, are, found, in, temperate, north, america, and, eastern, asia, these, large, fishes, are, similar, to, carps, in, appearance, and, ecology, members, of, the, cobitidae, are, common, across, eurasia, and, parts, of, north, africa, a, midsized, group, like, the, suckers, they, are, rather, similar, to, catfish, in, appearance, and, behaviour, feeding, primarily, off, the, substrate, and, equipped, with, barbels, to, help, them, locate, food, at, night, or, in, murky, conditions, fishes, in, the, families, cobitidae, balitoridae, botiidae, and, gyrinocheilidae, are, called, loaches, although, the, last, do, not, seem, to, belong, to, the, lineage, of, true, loaches, but, are, related, to, the, suckers, historically, these, included, all, the, forms, now, placed, in, the, superorder, ostariophysi, except, the, catfish, which, were, placed, in, the, order, siluriformes, by, this, definition, the, cypriniformes, were, paraphyletic, so, recently, the, orders, gonorhynchiformes, characiformes, characins, and, allies, and, gymnotiformes, knifefishes, and, electric, eels, have, been, separated, out, to, form, their, own, monophyletic, orders, the, families, of, cypriniformes, are, traditionally, divided, into, two, suborders, superfamily, cyprinioidea, contains, the, carps, and, minnows, cyprinidae, and, also, the, mountain, carps, as, the, family, psilorhynchidae, in, 2012, maurice, kottelat, reviewed, the, superfamily, cobitoidei, and, under, his, revision, it, now, consists, of, the, following, families, hillstream, loaches, balitoridae, barbuccidae, botiidae, suckers, catostomidae, true, loaches, cobitidae, ellopostomatidae, gastromyzontidae, sucking, loaches, gyrinocheilidae, stone, loaches, nemacheilidae, serpenticobitidae, and, long, finned, loaches, vaillantellidae, catostomoidea, is, usually, treated, as, a, junior, synonym, of, the, cobitoidei, but, it, could, be, split, off, the, catostomidae, and, gyrinocheilidae, in, a, distinct, superfamily, the, catostomoidea, might, be, closer, relatives, of, the, carps, and, minnows, than, of, the, true, loaches, while, the, cyprinioidea, seem, more, primitive, than, the, loach, like, forms, they, were, apparently, successful, enough, never, to, shift, from, the, original, ecological, niche, of, the, basal, ostariophysi, yet, from, the, ecomorphologically, conservative, main, lineage, apparently, at, least, two, major, radiations, branched, off, these, diversified, from, the, lowlands, into, torrential, river, habitats, acquiring, similar, habitus, and, adaptations, in, the, process, the, mountain, carps, are, the, highly, apomorphic, cyprinidae, perhaps, close, to, true, carps, cyprininae, or, maybe, to, the, danionins, while, some, details, about, the, phylogenetic, structures, of, this, massively, diverse, family, are, known, e, g, that, cultrinae, and, leuciscinae, are, rather, close, relatives, and, stand, apart, from, cyprininae, no, good, consensus, exists, yet, on, how, the, main, lineages, are, interrelated, a, systematic, list, from, the, most, ancient, to, the, most, modern, lineages, can, thus, be, given, as, phylogeny, based, on, the, work, of, the, following, works, cyprinidae, carps, minnows, psilorhynchidae, catostomidae, gyrinocheilidae, botiidae, vaillantellidae, cobitidae, balitoridae, ellopostomatidae, nemacheilidae, cypriniformes, include, the, most, primitive, of, the, ostariophysi, in, the, narrow, sense, i, e, excluding, the, gonorynchiformes, this, is, evidenced, not, only, by, physiological, details, but, also, by, their, great, distribution, which, indicates, they, had, the, longest, time, to, spread, the, earliest, that, cypriniformes, might, have, diverged, from, characiphysi, characiformes, and, relatives, is, thought, to, be, about, the, early, triassic, about, 250, million, years, ago, mya, however, their, divergence, probably, occurred, only, with, the, splitting, up, of, pangaea, in, the, jurassic, maybe, 160, million, years, ago, mya, by, 110, mya, the, plate, tectonics, evidence, indicates, that, the, laurasian, cypriniformes, must, have, been, distinct, from, their, gondwanan, relatives, the, cypriniformes, are, thought, to, have, originated, in, south, east, asia, where, the, most, diversity, of, this, group, is, found, today, the, alternative, hypothesis, is, that, they, began, in, south, america, similar, to, the, other, otophysans, if, this, were, the, case, they, would, have, spread, to, asia, through, africa, or, north, america, before, the, continents, split, up, for, these, are, purely, freshwater, fishes, as, the, characiformes, began, to, diversify, and, spread, they, may, have, outcompeted, south, american, basal, cypriniforms, in, africa, where, more, advanced, cypriniforms, survive, and, coexist, with, characiforms, the, earliest, cypriniform, fossils, are, already, assignable, to, the, living, family, catostomidae, from, the, paleocene, of, alberta, they, are, roughly, 60, million, years, old, during, the, eocene, 55, 35, mya, catostomids, and, cyprinids, spread, throughout, asia, the, earliest, members, of, the, cyprinid, subfamilies, barbinae, and, danioninae, are, known, from, the, eocene, sangkarewang, formation, of, indonesia, in, addition, to, possibly, smilogastrinae, and, labeoninae, the, extinct, family, jianghanichthyidae, is, known, from, the, eocene, of, china, in, the, oligocene, around, 30, mya, advanced, cyprinids, began, to, outcompete, catostomids, wherever, they, were, sympatric, causing, a, decline, of, the, suckers, cyprinids, reached, north, america, and, europe, about, the, same, time, and, africa, in, the, early, miocene, some, 23, 20, mya, the, cypriniforms, spread, to, north, america, through, the, bering, land, bridge, which, formed, and, disappeared, again, several, times, during, the, many, millions, of, years, of, cypriniform, evolution, the, cyprinidae, in, particular, are, important, in, a, variety, of, ways, many, species, are, important, food, fish, particularly, in, europe, and, asia, some, are, also, important, as, aquarium, fish, of, which, the, goldfish, and, koi, are, perhaps, the, most, celebrated, the, other, families, are, of, less, commercial, importance, the, catostomidae, have, some, importance, in, angling, and, some, loaches, are, bred, for, the, international, aquarium, fish, trade, accidentally, or, deliberately, introduced, populations, of, common, carp, cyprinus, carpio, and, grass, carp, ctenopharyngodon, idella, are, found, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, in, some, cases, these, exotic, species, have, a, negative, impact, on, the, environment, carp, in, particular, stir, up, the, riverbed, reducing, the, clarity, of, the, water, making, plant, growth, difficult, in, science, one, of, the, most, famous, members, of, the, cypriniformes, is, the, zebrafish, danio, rerio, the, zebrafish, is, one, of, the, most, important, vertebrate, model, organisms, in, biological, and, biochemical, sciences, being, used, in, many, kinds, of, experiments, during, early, development, the, zebrafish, has, a, nearly, transparent, body, so, it, is, ideal, for, studying, developmental, biology, it, is, also, used, for, the, elucidation, of, biochemical, signaling, pathways, they, are, also, good, pets, but, can, be, shy, in, bright, light, and, crowded, tanks, habitat, destruction, damming, of, upland, rivers, pollution, and, in, some, cases, overfishing, for, food, or, the, pet, trade, have, driven, some, cypriniformes, to, the, brink, of, extinction, or, even, beyond, in, particular, cyprinidae, of, southwestern, north, america, have, been, severely, affected, a, considerable, number, went, entirely, extinct, after, settlement, by, europeans, for, example, in, 1900, the, thicktail, chub, gila, crassicauda, was, the, most, common, freshwater, fish, found, in, california, 70, years, later, not, a, single, living, individual, existed, the, well, known, red, tailed, black, shark, epalzeorhynchos, bicolor, from, the, mae, klong, river, of, the, bridge, on, the, river, kwai, fame, possibly, only, survives, in, captivity, ironically, while, pollution, and, other, forms, of, overuse, by, humans, have, driven, it, from, its, native, home, it, is, bred, for, the, aquarium, fish, trade, by, the, thousands, the, yarqon, bleak, acanthobrama, telavivensis, from, the, yarqon, river, had, to, be, rescued, into, captivity, from, imminent, extinction, new, populations, have, apparently, been, established, again, successfully, from, captive, stock, the, balitoridae, and, cobitidae, meanwhile, contain, a, very, large, number, of, species, about, which, essentially, nothing, is, known, except, how, they, look, and, where, they, were, first, found, globally, extinct, cypriniformes, species, are
