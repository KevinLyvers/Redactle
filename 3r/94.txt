lake, tanganyika, t, n, j, i, k, n, tang, g, n, yee, k, gan, kirundi, ikiyaga, ca, tanganyika, is, an, african, great, lake, it, is, the, second, largest, freshwater, lake, by, volume, and, the, second, deepest, in, both, cases, after, lake, baikal, in, siberia, it, is, the, world, s, longest, freshwater, lake, the, lake, is, shared, among, four, countries, tanzania, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, the, drc, burundi, and, zambia, with, tanzania, 46, and, the, drc, 40, possessing, the, majority, of, the, lake, it, drains, into, the, congo, river, system, and, ultimately, into, the, atlantic, ocean, lake, tanganyika, is, situated, within, the, albertine, rift, the, western, branch, of, the, east, african, rift, and, is, confined, by, the, mountainous, walls, of, the, valley, it, is, the, largest, rift, lake, in, africa, and, the, second, largest, lake, by, volume, in, the, world, it, is, the, deepest, lake, in, africa, and, holds, the, greatest, volume, of, fresh, water, on, the, continent, accounting, for, 16, of, the, world, s, available, fresh, water, it, extends, for, 676, km, 420, mi, in, a, general, north, south, direction, and, averages, 50, km, 31, mi, in, width, the, lake, covers, 32, 900, km, 2, 12, 700, sq, mi, with, a, shoreline, of, 1, 828, km, 1, 136, mi, a, mean, depth, of, 570, m, 1, 870, ft, and, a, maximum, depth, of, 1, 470, m, 4, 820, ft, in, the, northern, basin, it, holds, an, estimated, 18, 750, km, 3, 4, 500, cu, mi, the, catchment, area, of, the, lake, is, 231, 000, km, 2, 89, 000, sq, mi, two, main, rivers, flow, into, the, lake, as, well, as, numerous, smaller, rivers, and, streams, whose, lengths, are, limited, by, the, steep, mountains, around, the, lake, the, one, major, outflow, is, the, lukuga, river, which, empties, into, the, congo, river, drainage, precipitation, and, evaporation, play, a, greater, role, than, the, rivers, at, least, 90, of, the, water, influx, is, from, rain, falling, on, the, lake, s, surface, and, at, least, 90, of, the, water, loss, is, from, direct, evaporation, the, major, river, flowing, into, the, lake, is, the, ruzizi, river, formed, about, 10, 000, years, ago, which, enters, the, north, of, the, lake, from, lake, kivu, the, malagarasi, river, which, is, tanzania, s, second, largest, river, enters, the, east, side, of, lake, tanganyika, the, malagarasi, is, older, than, lake, tanganyika, and, before, the, lake, was, formed, it, probably, was, a, headwater, of, the, lualaba, river, the, main, congo, river, headstream, the, lake, has, a, complex, history, of, changing, flow, patterns, due, to, its, high, altitude, great, depth, slow, rate, of, refill, and, mountainous, location, in, a, turbulently, volcanic, area, that, has, undergone, climate, changes, apparently, it, has, rarely, in, the, past, had, an, outflow, to, the, sea, it, has, been, described, as, practically, endorheic, for, this, reason, the, lake, s, connection, to, the, sea, is, dependent, on, a, high, water, level, allowing, water, to, overflow, out, of, the, lake, through, the, lukuga, river, into, the, congo, when, not, overflowing, the, lake, s, exit, into, the, lukuga, river, typically, is, blocked, by, sand, bars, and, masses, of, weed, and, instead, this, river, depends, on, its, own, tributaries, especially, the, niemba, river, to, maintain, a, flow, the, lake, may, also, have, at, times, had, different, inflows, and, outflows, inward, flows, from, a, higher, lake, rukwa, access, to, lake, malawi, and, an, exit, route, to, the, nile, have, all, been, proposed, to, have, existed, at, some, point, in, the, lake, s, history, lake, tanganyika, is, an, ancient, lake, one, of, only, twenty, more, than, a, million, years, old, its, three, basins, which, in, periods, with, much, lower, water, levels, were, separate, lakes, are, of, different, ages, the, central, began, to, form, 9, 12, million, years, ago, mya, the, northern, 7, 8, mya, and, the, southern, 2, 4, mya, the, lake, s, water, is, alkaline, with, a, ph, around, 9, at, depths, of, 0, 100, m, 0, 330, ft, below, this, it, is, around, 8, 7, gradually, decreasing, to, 8, 3, 8, 5, in, the, deepest, parts, of, tanganyika, a, similar, pattern, can, be, seen, in, the, electric, conductivity, ranging, from, about, 670, s, cm, in, the, upper, part, to, 690, s, cm, in, the, deepest, surface, temperatures, generally, range, from, about, 24, c, 75, f, in, the, southern, part, of, the, lake, in, early, august, to, 28, 29, c, 82, 84, f, in, the, late, rainy, season, in, march, april, at, depths, greater, than, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, the, temperature, is, very, stable, at, 23, 1, 23, 4, c, 73, 6, 74, 1, f, the, water, has, gradually, warmed, since, the, 19th, century, and, this, has, accelerated, with, global, warming, since, the, 1950s, the, lake, is, stratified, and, seasonal, mixing, generally, does, not, extend, beyond, depths, of, 150, m, 490, ft, the, mixing, mainly, occurs, as, upwellings, in, the, south, and, is, wind, driven, but, to, a, lesser, extent, up, and, downwellings, also, occur, elsewhere, in, the, lake, as, a, consequence, of, the, stratification, the, deep, sections, contain, fossil, water, this, also, means, it, has, no, oxygen, it, is, anoxic, in, the, deeper, parts, essentially, limiting, fish, and, other, aerobic, organisms, to, the, upper, part, some, geographical, variations, are, seen, in, this, limit, but, it, is, typically, at, depths, around, 100, m, 330, ft, in, the, northern, part, of, the, lake, and, 240, 250, m, 790, 820, ft, in, the, south, the, oxygen, devoid, deepest, sections, contain, high, levels, of, toxic, hydrogen, sulphide, and, are, essentially, lifeless, except, for, bacteria, lake, tanganyika, and, its, associated, wetlands, are, home, to, nile, crocodiles, including, famous, giant, gustave, zambian, hinged, terrapins, serrated, hinged, terrapins, and, pan, hinged, terrapins, last, species, not, in, the, lake, itself, but, in, adjacent, lagoons, storm, s, water, cobra, a, threatened, subspecies, of, banded, water, cobra, that, feeds, mainly, on, fish, is, only, found, in, lake, tanganyika, where, it, prefers, rocky, shores, the, lake, holds, at, least, 250, species, of, cichlid, fish, and, undescribed, species, remain, almost, all, 98, of, the, tanganyika, cichlids, are, endemic, to, the, lake, and, it, is, thus, an, important, biological, resource, for, the, study, of, speciation, in, evolution, some, of, the, endemics, do, occur, slightly, into, the, upper, lukuga, river, lake, tanganyika, s, outflow, but, further, spread, into, the, congo, river, basin, is, prevented, by, physics, lukuga, has, fast, flowing, sections, with, many, rapids, and, waterfalls, and, chemistry, tanganyika, s, water, is, alkaline, while, the, congo, s, generally, is, acidic, the, cichlids, of, the, african, great, lakes, including, tanganyika, represent, the, most, diverse, extent, of, adaptive, radiation, in, vertebrates, although, tanganyika, has, far, fewer, cichlid, species, than, lakes, malawi, and, victoria, which, both, have, experienced, relatively, recent, explosive, species, radiations, resulting, in, many, closely, related, species, its, cichlids, are, the, most, morphologically, and, genetically, diverse, this, is, linked, to, the, high, age, of, tanganyika, as, it, is, far, older, than, the, other, lakes, tanganyika, has, the, largest, number, of, endemic, cichlid, genera, of, all, african, lakes, all, tanganyika, cichlids, are, in, the, subfamily, pseudocrenilabrinae, of, the, 10, tribes, in, this, subfamily, half, are, largely, or, entirely, restricted, to, the, lake, cyprichromini, ectodini, lamprologini, limnochromini, and, tropheini, and, another, three, have, species, in, the, lake, haplochromini, tilapiini, and, tylochromini, others, have, proposed, splitting, the, tanganyika, cichlids, into, as, many, as, 12, 16, tribes, in, addition, to, previous, mentioned, bathybatini, benthochromini, boulengerochromini, cyphotilapiini, eretmodini, greenwoodochromini, perissodini, and, trematocarini, most, tanganyika, cichlids, live, along, the, shoreline, down, to, a, depth, of, 100, m, 330, ft, but, some, deep, water, species, regularly, descend, to, 200, m, 660, ft, trematocara, species, have, exceptionally, been, found, at, more, than, 300, m, 980, ft, which, is, deeper, than, any, other, cichlid, in, the, world, some, of, the, deep, water, cichlids, e, g, bathybates, gnathochromis, hemibates, and, xenochromis, have, been, caught, in, places, virtually, devoid, of, oxygen, but, how, they, are, able, to, survive, there, is, unclear, tanganyika, cichlids, are, generally, benthic, found, at, or, near, the, bottom, and, or, coastal, no, tanganyika, cichlids, are, truly, pelagic, and, offshore, except, for, some, of, the, piscivorous, bathybates, two, of, these, b, fasciatus, and, b, leo, mainly, feed, on, tanganyika, sardines, tanganyika, cichlids, differ, extensively, in, ecology, and, include, species, that, are, herbivores, detritivores, planktivores, insectivores, molluscivores, scavengers, scale, eaters, and, piscivores, these, dietary, specializations, however, have, been, shown, to, be, flexible, that, is, many, species, of, tanganyikan, cichlid, with, specialized, diets, showed, opportunistic, episodic, exploitation, of, stolothrissa, tanganicae, and, limnothrissa, miodon, when, prey, concentrations, were, unusually, high, their, breeding, behavior, fall, into, two, main, groups, the, substrate, spawners, often, in, caves, or, rock, crevices, and, the, mouthbrooders, among, the, endemic, species, are, two, of, the, world, s, smallest, cichlids, neolamprologus, multifasciatus, and, n, similis, both, shell, dwellers, at, up, to, 4, 5, cm, 1, 6, 2, 0, in, and, one, of, the, largest, the, giant, cichlid, boulengerochromis, microlepis, at, up, to, 90, cm, 3, 0, ft, many, cichlids, from, lake, tanganyika, such, as, species, from, the, genera, altolamprologus, cyprichromis, eretmodus, julidochromis, lamprologus, neolamprologus, tropheus, and, xenotilapia, are, popular, aquarium, fish, due, to, their, bright, colors, and, patterns, and, interesting, behaviors, recreating, a, lake, tanganyika, biotope, to, host, those, cichlids, in, a, habitat, similar, to, their, natural, environment, is, also, popular, in, the, aquarium, hobby, lake, tanganyika, is, home, to, more, than, 80, species, of, non, cichlid, fish, and, about, 60, of, these, are, endemic, the, open, waters, of, the, pelagic, zone, are, dominated, by, four, non, cichlid, species, two, species, of, tanganyika, sardine, limnothrissa, miodon, and, stolothrissa, tanganicae, form, the, largest, biomass, of, fish, in, this, zone, and, they, are, important, prey, for, the, forktail, lates, lates, microlepis, and, sleek, lates, l, stappersii, two, additional, lates, are, found, in, the, lake, the, tanganyika, lates, l, angustifrons, and, bigeye, lates, l, mariae, but, both, these, are, primarily, benthic, hunters, although, they, also, may, move, into, open, waters, the, four, lates, all, endemic, to, tanganyika, have, been, overfished, and, larger, individuals, are, rare, today, among, the, more, unusual, fish, in, the, lake, are, the, endemic, facultatively, brood, parasitic, cuckoo, catfish, including, at, least, synodontis, grandiops, and, s, multipunctatus, a, number, of, others, are, very, similar, e, g, s, lucipinnis, and, s, petricola, and, have, often, been, confused, it, is, unclear, if, they, have, a, similar, behavior, the, facultative, brood, parasites, often, lay, their, eggs, synchronously, with, mouthbroding, cichlids, the, cichlid, pick, up, the, eggs, in, their, mouth, as, if, they, were, their, own, once, the, catfish, eggs, hatch, the, young, eat, the, cichlid, eggs, six, catfish, genera, are, entirely, restricted, to, the, lake, basin, bathybagrus, dinotopterus, lophiobagrus, phyllonemus, pseudotanganikallabes, and, tanganikallabes, although, not, endemic, on, a, genus, level, six, species, of, chrysichthys, catfish, are, only, found, in, the, tanganyika, basin, where, they, live, both, in, shallow, and, relatively, deep, waters, in, the, latter, habitat, they, are, the, primary, predators, and, scavengers, a, unique, evolutionary, radiation, in, the, lake, is, the, 15, species, of, mastacembelus, spiny, eels, all, but, one, endemic, to, its, basin, although, other, african, great, lakes, have, synodontis, catfish, endemic, catfish, genera, and, mastacembelus, spiny, eels, the, relatively, high, diversity, is, unique, to, tanganyika, which, likely, is, related, to, its, old, age, among, the, non, endemic, fish, some, are, widespread, african, species, but, several, are, only, shared, with, the, malagarasi, and, congo, river, basins, such, as, the, congo, bichir, polypterus, congicus, goliath, tigerfish, hydrocynus, goliath, citharinus, citharus, six, banded, distichodus, distichodus, sexfasciatus, and, mbu, puffer, tetraodon, mbu, a, total, of, 83, freshwater, snail, species, 65, endemic, and, 11, bivalve, species, 8, endemic, are, known, from, the, lake, among, the, endemic, bivalves, are, three, monotypic, genera, grandidieria, burtoni, pseudospatha, tanganyicensis, and, brazzaea, anceyi, many, of, the, snails, are, unusual, for, species, living, in, freshwater, in, having, noticeably, thickened, shells, and, or, distinct, sculpture, features, more, commonly, seen, in, marine, snails, they, are, referred, to, as, thalassoids, which, can, be, translated, to, marine, like, all, the, tanganyika, thalassoids, which, are, part, of, prosobranchia, are, endemic, to, the, lake, initially, they, were, believed, to, be, related, to, similar, marine, snails, but, they, are, now, known, to, be, unrelated, their, appearance, is, now, believed, to, be, the, result, of, the, highly, diverse, habitats, in, lake, tanganyika, and, evolutionary, pressure, from, snail, eating, fish, and, in, particular, platythelphusa, crabs, a, total, of, 17, freshwater, snail, genera, are, endemic, to, the, lake, such, as, hirthia, lavigeria, paramelania, reymondia, spekia, stanleya, tanganyicia, and, tiphobia, there, are, about, 30, species, of, non, thalassoid, snails, in, the, lake, but, only, five, of, these, are, endemic, including, ferrissia, tanganyicensis, and, neothauma, tanganyicense, the, latter, is, the, largest, tanganyika, snail, and, its, shell, is, often, used, by, small, shell, dwelling, cichlids, crustaceans, are, also, highly, diverse, in, tanganyika, with, more, than, 200, species, of, which, more, than, half, are, endemic, they, include, 10, species, of, freshwater, crabs, 9, platythelphusa, and, potamonautes, platynotus, all, endemic, at, least, 11, species, of, small, atyid, shrimp, atyella, caridella, and, limnocaridina, an, endemic, palaemonid, shrimp, macrobrachium, moorei, about, 100, ostracods, including, many, endemics, and, several, copepods, among, these, limnocaridina, iridinae, lives, inside, the, mantle, cavity, of, the, unionid, mussel, pleiodon, spekei, making, it, one, of, only, two, known, commensal, species, of, freshwater, shrimp, the, other, is, the, sponge, living, caridina, spongicola, from, lake, towuti, indonesia, among, rift, valley, lakes, lake, tanganyika, far, surpasses, all, others, in, terms, of, crustacean, and, freshwater, snail, richness, both, in, total, number, of, species, and, number, of, endemics, for, example, the, only, other, rift, valley, lake, with, endemic, freshwater, crabs, are, lake, kivu, and, lake, victoria, with, two, species, each, the, diversity, of, other, invertebrate, groups, in, lake, tanganyika, is, often, not, well, known, but, there, are, at, least, 20, described, species, of, leeches, 12, endemics, 9, sponges, 7, endemic, 6, bryozoa, 2, endemic, 11, flatworms, 7, endemic, 20, nematodes, 7, endemic, 28, annelids, 17, endemic, and, the, small, hydrozoan, jellyfish, limnocnida, tanganyicae, lake, tanganyika, supports, a, major, fishery, which, depending, on, source, provides, 25, 40, or, c, 60, of, the, animal, protein, in, the, diet, of, the, people, living, in, the, region, lake, tanganyika, fish, can, be, found, exported, throughout, east, africa, major, commercial, fishing, began, in, the, mid, 1950s, and, has, together, with, global, warming, had, a, heavy, impact, on, the, fish, populations, causing, significant, declines, in, 2016, it, was, estimated, that, the, total, catch, was, up, to, 200, 000, tonnes, it, is, thought, that, early, homo, sapiens, were, making, an, impact, on, the, region, during, the, stone, age, the, time, period, of, the, middle, stone, age, to, late, stone, age, is, described, as, an, age, of, advanced, hunter, gatherers, there, are, many, methods, in, which, the, native, people, of, the, area, were, fishing, most, of, them, included, using, a, lantern, as, a, lure, for, fish, that, are, attracted, to, light, there, were, three, basic, forms, one, called, lusenga, which, is, a, wide, net, used, by, one, person, from, a, canoe, the, second, one, is, using, a, lift, net, this, was, done, by, dropping, a, net, deep, below, the, boat, using, two, parallel, canoes, and, then, simultaneously, pulling, it, up, the, third, is, called, chiromila, which, consisted, of, three, canoes, one, canoe, was, stationary, with, a, lantern, while, another, canoe, holds, one, end, of, the, net, and, the, other, circles, the, stationary, one, to, meet, up, with, the, net, the, first, known, westerners, to, find, the, lake, were, the, british, explorers, richard, burton, and, john, speke, in, 1858, they, located, it, while, searching, for, the, source, of, the, nile, river, speke, continued, and, found, the, actual, source, lake, victoria, later, david, livingstone, passed, by, the, lake, he, noted, the, name, liemba, for, its, southern, part, a, word, probably, from, the, fipa, language, tanganyika, means, stars, in, the, luvale, language, 523, the, lake, was, the, scene, of, battle, for, lake, tanganyika, during, world, war, i, with, the, aid, of, the, graf, goetzen, the, germans, had, complete, control, of, the, lake, in, the, early, stages, of, the, war, the, ship, was, used, both, to, ferry, cargo, and, personnel, across, the, lake, and, as, a, base, from, which, to, launch, surprise, attacks, on, allied, troops, it, therefore, became, essential, for, the, allied, forces, to, gain, control, of, the, lake, themselves, under, the, command, of, lieutenant, commander, geoffrey, spicer, simson, the, british, royal, navy, achieved, the, monumental, task, of, bringing, two, armed, motor, boats, hms, mimi, and, hms, toutou, from, england, to, the, lake, by, rail, road, and, river, to, albertville, since, renamed, kalemie, in, 1971, on, the, western, shore, of, lake, tanganyika, the, two, boats, waited, until, december, 1915, and, mounted, a, surprise, attack, on, the, germans, with, the, capture, of, the, gunboat, kingani, another, german, vessel, the, hedwig, was, sunk, in, february, 1916, leaving, the, g, tzen, as, the, only, german, vessel, remaining, to, control, the, lake, in, order, to, avoid, his, prize, ship, falling, into, allied, hands, zimmer, scuttled, the, vessel, on, july, 26, 1916, the, vessel, was, later, raised, in, 1924, and, renamed, mv, liemba
