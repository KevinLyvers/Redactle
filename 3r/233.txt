formidable, resistance, by, indigenous, canarians, professor, mohamed, adhikari, has, defined, the, conquest, of, the, islands, as, a, genocide, of, the, guanches, b, thencourt, received, the, title, king, of, the, canary, islands, but, still, recognised, king, henry, iii, as, his, overlord, it, was, not, a, simple, military, enterprise, given, the, aboriginal, resistance, on, some, islands, neither, was, it, politically, since, the, particular, interests, of, the, nobility, determined, to, strengthen, their, economic, and, political, power, through, the, acquisition, of, the, islands, conflicted, with, those, of, the, states, particularly, castile, which, were, in, the, midst, of, territorial, expansion, and, in, a, process, of, strengthening, of, the, crown, against, the, nobility, historians, distinguish, two, periods, in, the, conquest, of, the, canary, islands, aristocratic, conquest, conquista, se, orial, this, refers, to, the, early, conquests, carried, out, by, the, nobility, for, their, own, benefit, and, without, the, direct, participation, of, the, crown, of, castile, which, merely, granted, rights, of, conquest, in, exchange, for, pacts, of, vassalage, between, the, noble, conqueror, and, the, crown, one, can, identify, within, this, period, an, early, phase, known, as, the, betancurian, or, norman, conquest, carried, out, by, jean, de, bethencourt, who, was, originally, from, normandy, and, gadifer, de, la, salle, between, 1402, and, 1405, which, involved, the, islands, of, lanzarote, el, hierro, and, fuerteventura, the, subsequent, phase, is, known, as, the, castilian, conquest, carried, out, by, castilian, nobles, who, acquired, through, purchases, assignments, and, marriages, the, previously, conquered, islands, and, also, incorporated, the, island, of, la, gomera, around, 1450, royal, conquest, conquista, realenga, this, defines, the, conquest, between, 1478, and, 1496, carried, out, directly, by, the, crown, of, castile, during, the, reign, of, the, catholic, monarchs, who, armed, and, partly, financed, the, conquest, of, those, islands, which, were, still, unconquered, gran, canaria, la, palma, and, tenerife, this, phase, of, the, conquest, came, to, an, end, in, the, year, 1496, with, the, dominion, of, the, island, of, tenerife, bringing, the, entire, canarian, archipelago, under, the, control, of, the, crown, of, castile, b, thencourt, also, established, a, base, on, the, island, of, la, gomera, but, it, would, be, many, years, before, the, island, was, fully, conquered, the, natives, of, la, gomera, and, of, gran, canaria, tenerife, and, la, palma, resisted, the, castilian, invaders, for, almost, a, century, in, 1448, maciot, de, b, thencourt, sold, the, lordship, of, lanzarote, to, portugal, s, prince, henry, the, navigator, an, action, that, was, accepted, by, neither, the, natives, nor, the, castilians, despite, pope, nicholas, v, ruling, that, the, canary, islands, were, under, portuguese, control, the, crisis, swelled, to, a, revolt, which, lasted, until, 1459, with, the, final, expulsion, of, the, portuguese, in, 1479, portugal, and, castile, signed, the, treaty, of, alc, ovas, which, settled, disputes, between, castile, and, portugal, over, the, control, of, the, atlantic, this, treaty, recognized, castilian, control, of, the, canary, islands, but, also, confirmed, portuguese, possession, of, the, azores, madeira, and, the, cape, verde, islands, and, gave, the, portuguese, rights, to, any, further, islands, or, lands, in, the, atlantic, that, might, be, discovered, the, castilians, continued, to, dominate, the, islands, but, due, to, the, topography, and, the, resistance, of, the, native, guanches, they, did, not, achieve, complete, control, until, 1496, when, tenerife, and, la, palma, were, finally, subdued, by, alonso, fern, ndez, de, lugo, as, a, result, of, this, the, native, pre, hispanic, population, declined, quickly, due, to, war, epidemics, and, slavery, the, canaries, were, incorporated, into, the, kingdom, of, castile, after, the, conquest, the, castilians, imposed, a, new, economic, model, based, on, single, crop, cultivation, first, sugarcane, then, wine, an, important, item, of, trade, with, england, gran, canaria, was, conquered, by, the, crown, of, castile, on, 6, march, 1480, and, tenerife, was, conquered, in, 1496, and, each, had, its, own, governor, there, has, been, speculation, that, the, abundance, of, roccella, tinctoria, on, the, canary, islands, offered, a, profit, motive, for, jean, de, b, thencourt, during, his, conquest, of, the, islands, lichen, has, been, used, for, centuries, to, make, dyes, this, includes, royal, purple, colors, derived, from, r, tinctoria, also, known, as, orseille, the, objective, of, the, spanish, crown, to, convert, the, islands, into, a, powerhouse, of, cultivation, required, a, much, larger, labour, force, this, was, attained, through, a, brutal, practice, of, enslavement, not, only, of, indigenous, canarians, but, large, numbers, of, africans, who, were, forcibly, taken, from, north, and, sub, saharan, africa, whilst, the, first, slave, plantations, in, the, atlantic, region, were, across, madeira, cape, verde, and, the, canary, islands, it, was, only, the, canary, islands, which, had, an, indigenous, population, and, were, therefore, invaded, rather, than, newly, occupied, this, agriculture, industry, was, largely, based, on, sugarcane, and, the, castilians, converted, large, swaths, of, the, landscape, for, sugarcane, production, and, the, processing, and, manufacturing, of, sugar, facilitated, by, enslaved, labourers, the, cities, of, santa, cruz, de, tenerife, and, las, palmas, de, gran, canaria, became, a, stopping, point, for, the, spanish, traders, as, well, as, conquistadors, and, missionaries, on, their, way, to, the, new, world, this, trade, route, brought, great, wealth, to, the, castilian, social, sectors, of, the, islands, and, soon, were, attracting, merchants, and, adventurers, from, all, over, europe, as, the, wealth, grew, enslaved, african, workers, were, also, forced, into, demeaning, domestic, roles, for, the, rich, castilians, on, the, islands, such, as, servants, in, their, houses, research, on, the, skeletons, of, some, of, these, enslaved, workers, from, the, burial, site, of, finca, clavijo, on, gran, canaria, have, showed, that, all, of, the, adults, buried, in, finca, clavijo, undertook, extensive, physical, activity, that, involved, significant, stress, on, the, spine, and, appendicular, skeleton, that, result, from, relentless, hard, labour, akin, to, the, physical, abnormalities, found, with, enslaved, peoples, from, other, sugarcane, plantations, around, the, world, these, findings, of, the, physical, strain, that, the, enslaved, at, finca, clavijo, were, subjected, to, in, order, to, provide, wealth, for, the, spanish, elite, has, inspired, a, poem, by, british, writer, ralph, hoyte, entitled, close, to, the, bone, as, a, result, of, the, huge, wealth, generated, magnificent, palaces, and, churches, were, built, on, la, palma, during, this, busy, prosperous, period, the, church, of, el, salvador, survives, as, one, of, the, island, s, finest, examples, of, the, architecture, of, the, 16th, century, civilian, architecture, survives, in, forms, such, as, casas, de, los, s, nchez, ochando, or, casa, quintana, the, canaries, wealth, invited, attacks, by, pirates, and, privateers, ottoman, turkish, admiral, and, privateer, kemal, reis, ventured, into, the, canaries, in, 1501, while, murat, reis, the, elder, captured, lanzarote, in, 1585, the, most, severe, attack, took, place, in, 1599, during, the, dutch, revolt, a, dutch, fleet, of, 74, ships, and, 12, 000, men, commanded, by, pieter, van, der, does, attacked, the, capital, las, palmas, de, gran, canaria, the, city, had, 3, 500, of, gran, canaria, s, 8, 545, inhabitants, the, dutch, attacked, the, castillo, de, la, luz, which, guarded, the, harbor, the, canarians, evacuated, civilians, from, the, city, and, the, castillo, surrendered, but, not, the, city, the, dutch, moved, inland, but, canarian, cavalry, drove, them, back, to, tamaraceite, near, the, city, the, dutch, then, laid, siege, to, the, city, demanding, the, surrender, of, all, its, wealth, they, received, 12, sheep, and, 3, calves, furious, the, dutch, sent, 4, 000, soldiers, to, attack, the, council, of, the, canaries, who, were, sheltering, in, the, village, of, santa, br, gida, three, hundred, canarian, soldiers, ambushed, the, dutch, in, the, village, of, monte, lentiscal, killing, 150, and, forcing, the, rest, to, retreat, the, dutch, concentrated, on, las, palmas, de, gran, canaria, attempting, to, burn, it, down, the, dutch, pillaged, maspalomas, on, the, southern, coast, of, gran, canaria, san, sebasti, n, on, la, gomera, and, santa, cruz, on, la, palma, but, eventually, gave, up, the, siege, of, las, palmas, and, withdrew, in, 1618, the, barbary, pirates, from, north, africa, attacked, lanzarote, and, la, gomera, taking, 1000, captives, to, be, sold, as, slaves, another, noteworthy, attack, occurred, in, 1797, when, santa, cruz, de, tenerife, was, attacked, by, a, british, fleet, under, horatio, nelson, on, 25, july, the, british, were, repulsed, losing, almost, 400, men, it, was, during, this, battle, that, nelson, lost, his, right, arm, the, sugar, based, economy, of, the, islands, faced, stiff, competition, from, spain, s, caribbean, colonies, low, sugar, prices, in, the, 19th, century, caused, severe, recessions, on, the, islands, a, new, cash, crop, cochineal, cochinilla, came, into, cultivation, during, this, time, reinvigorating, the, islands, economy, during, this, time, the, canarian, american, trade, was, developed, in, which, canarian, products, such, as, cochineal, sugarcane, and, rum, were, sold, in, american, ports, such, as, veracruz, campeche, la, guaira, and, havana, among, others, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, canary, islanders, had, already, emigrated, to, spanish, american, territories, such, as, havana, veracruz, and, santo, domingo, san, antonio, texas, and, st, bernard, parish, louisiana, these, economic, difficulties, spurred, mass, emigration, during, the, 19th, and, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, primarily, to, the, americas, between, 1840, and, 1890, as, many, as, 40, 000, canary, islanders, emigrated, to, venezuela, also, thousands, of, canarians, moved, to, puerto, rico, where, the, spanish, monarchy, felt, that, canarians, would, adapt, to, island, life, better, than, other, immigrants, from, the, mainland, of, spain, deeply, entrenched, traditions, such, as, the, mascaras, festival, in, the, town, of, hatillo, puerto, rico, are, an, example, of, canarian, culture, still, preserved, in, puerto, rico, similarly, many, thousands, of, canarians, emigrated, to, the, shores, of, cuba, during, the, spanish, american, war, of, 1898, the, spanish, fortified, the, islands, against, a, possible, american, attack, but, no, such, event, took, place, sirera, and, renn, 2004, distinguish, two, different, types, of, expeditions, or, voyages, during, the, period, 1770, 1830, which, they, term, the, romantic, period, first, are, expeditions, financed, by, the, states, closely, related, with, the, official, scientific, institutions, characterised, by, having, strict, scientific, objectives, and, inspired, by, the, spirit, of, illustration, and, progress, in, this, type, of, expedition, sirera, and, renn, include, the, following, travellers, the, second, type, of, expedition, identified, by, sirera, and, renn, is, one, that, took, place, starting, from, more, or, less, private, initiatives, among, these, the, key, exponents, were, the, following, sirera, and, renn, identify, the, period, 1770, 1830, as, one, in, which, in, a, panorama, dominated, until, that, moment, by, france, and, england, enters, with, strength, and, brio, germany, of, the, romantic, period, whose, presence, in, the, islands, will, increase, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, british, introduced, a, new, cash, crop, the, banana, the, export, of, which, was, controlled, by, companies, such, as, fyffes, 30, november, 1833, the, province, of, canary, islands, had, been, created, with, the, capital, being, declared, as, santa, cruz, de, tenerife, the, rivalry, between, the, cities, of, las, palmas, de, gran, canaria, and, santa, cruz, de, tenerife, for, the, capital, of, the, islands, led, to, the, division, of, the, archipelago, into, two, provinces, on, 23, september, 1927, during, the, time, of, the, second, spanish, republic, marxist, and, anarchist, workers, movements, began, to, develop, led, by, figures, such, as, jose, miguel, perez, and, guillermo, ascanio, however, outside, of, a, few, municipalities, these, organisations, were, a, minority, and, fell, easily, to, nationalist, forces, during, the, spanish, civil, war, in, 1936, francisco, franco, was, appointed, general, commandant, of, the, canaries, he, joined, the, military, revolt, of, 17, july, which, began, the, spanish, civil, war, franco, quickly, took, control, of, the, archipelago, except, for, a, few, points, of, resistance, on, la, palma, and, in, the, town, of, vallehermoso, on, la, gomera, though, there, was, never, a, war, in, the, islands, the, post, war, suppression, of, political, dissent, on, the, canaries, was, most, severe, during, the, second, world, war, winston, churchill, prepared, plans, for, the, british, seizure, of, the, canary, islands, as, a, naval, base, in, the, event, of, gibraltar, being, invaded, from, the, spanish, mainland, the, planned, operation, was, known, as, operation, pilgrim, opposition, to, franco, s, regime, did, not, begin, to, organise, until, the, late, 1950s, which, experienced, an, upheaval, of, parties, such, as, the, communist, party, of, spain, and, the, formation, of, various, nationalist, leftist, parties, during, the, ifni, war, the, franco, regime, set, up, concentration, camps, on, the, islands, to, extrajudicially, imprison, those, in, western, sahara, suspected, of, disloyalty, to, spain, many, of, whom, were, colonial, troops, recruited, on, the, spot, but, were, later, deemed, to, be, potential, fifth, columnists, and, deported, to, the, canary, islands, these, camps, were, characterised, by, the, use, of, forced, labour, for, infrastructure, projects, and, highly, unsanitary, conditions, resulting, in, the, widespread, occurrence, of, tuberculosis, after, the, death, of, franco, there, was, a, pro, independence, armed, movement, based, in, algeria, the, movement, for, the, independence, and, self, determination, of, the, canaries, archipelago, maiac, in, 1968, the, organisation, of, african, unity, recognized, the, maiac, as, a, legitimate, african, independence, movement, and, declared, the, canary, islands, as, an, african, territory, still, under, foreign, rule, after, the, establishment, of, a, democratic, constitutional, monarchy, in, spain, autonomy, was, granted, to, the, canaries, via, a, law, passed, in, 1982, with, a, newly, established, autonomous, devolved, government, and, parliament, in, 1983, the, first, autonomous, elections, were, held, the, spanish, socialist, workers, party, psoe, won, at, present, the, canary, islands, is, the, only, autonomous, community, in, spain, that, has, two, capitals, santa, cruz, de, tenerife, and, las, palmas, de, gran, canaria, since, the, statute, of, autonomy, of, the, canary, islands, was, created, in, 1982, the, political, capital, of, the, archipelago, did, not, exist, as, such, until, the, nineteenth, century, the, first, cities, founded, by, the, europeans, at, the, time, of, the, conquest, of, the, canary, islands, in, the, 15th, century, were, telde, in, gran, canaria, san, marcial, del, rubic, n, in, lanzarote, and, betancuria, in, fuerteventura, these, cities, boasted, the, first, european, institutions, present, in, the, archipelago, including, catholic, bishoprics, although, because, the, period, of, splendor, of, these, cities, developed, before, the, total, conquest, of, the, archipelago, and, its, incorporation, into, the, crown, of, castile, never, had, a, political, and, real, control, of, the, entire, canary, archipelago, the, function, of, a, canarian, city, with, full, jurisdiction, for, the, entire, archipelago, only, exists, after, the, conquest, of, the, canary, islands, although, originally, de, facto, that, is, without, legal, and, real, meaning, and, linked, to, the, headquarters, of, the, canary, islands, general, captaincy, las, palmas, de, gran, canaria, was, the, first, city, that, exercised, this, function, this, is, because, the, residence, of, the, captain, general, of, the, canary, islands, was, in, this, city, during, part, of, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, in, may, 1661, the, captain, general, of, the, canary, islands, jer, nimo, de, benavente, y, qui, ones, moved, the, headquarters, of, the, captaincy, to, the, city, of, san, crist, bal, de, la, laguna, on, the, island, of, tenerife, this, was, due, to, the, fact, that, this, island, since, the, conquest, was, the, most, populated, productive, and, with, the, highest, economic, expectations, la, laguna, would, be, considered, the, de, facto, capital, of, the, archipelago, until, the, official, status, of, the, capital, of, canary, islands, in, the, city, of, santa, cruz, de, tenerife, was, confirmed, in, the, 19th, century, due, in, part, to, the, constant, controversies, and, rivalries, between, the, bourgeoisies, of, san, crist, bal, de, la, laguna, and, las, palmas, de, gran, canaria, for, the, economic, political, and, institutional, hegemony, of, the, archipelago, already, in, 1723, the, captain, general, of, the, canary, islands, lorenzo, fernandez, de, villavicencio, had, moved, the, headquarters, of, the, general, captaincy, of, the, canary, islands, from, san, crist, bal, de, la, laguna, to, santa, cruz, de, tenerife, this, decision, continued, without, pleasing, the, society, of, the, island, of, gran, canaria, it, would, be, after, the, creation, of, the, province, of, canary, islands, in, november, 1833, in, which, santa, cruz, would, become, the, first, fully, official, capital, of, the, canary, islands, de, jure, and, not, of, de, facto, as, happened, previously, santa, cruz, de, tenerife, would, be, the, capital, of, the, canary, archipelago, until, during, the, government, of, general, primo, de, rivera, in, 1927, the, province, of, canary, islands, was, split, in, two, provinces, las, palmas, with, capital, in, las, palmas, de, gran, canaria, and, santa, cruz, de, tenerife, with, capital, in, the, homonymous, city, finally, with, the, statute, of, autonomy, of, the, canary, islands, in, 1982, and, the, creation, of, the, autonomous, community, of, the, canary, islands, the, capital, of, the, archipelago, between, las, palmas, de, gran, canaria, and, santa, cruz, de, tenerife, is, fixed, which, is, how, it, remains, today, the, canary, islands, have, a, population, of, 2, 153, 389, inhabitants, 2019, making, it, the, eighth, most, populous, of, spain, s, autonomous, communities, the, total, area, of, the, archipelago, is, 7, 493, km, 2, 2, 893, sq, mi, resulting, in, a, population, density, of, 287, 4, inhabitants, per, square, kilometre, the, population, of, the, islands, according, to, the, 2019, data, are, the, canary, islands, have, become, home, to, many, european, residents, mainly, coming, from, italy, germany, and, the, uk, because, of, the, vast, immigration, to, venezuela, and, cuba, during, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, and, the, later, return, to, the, canary, islands, of, these, people, along, with, their, families, there, are, many, residents, whose, country, of, origin, was, venezuela, 66, 593, or, cuba, 41, 807, since, the, 1990s, many, illegal, migrants, have, reached, the, canary, islands, melilla, and, ceuta, using, them, as, entry, points, to, the, eu, the, catholic, church, has, been, the, majority, religion, in, the, archipelago, for, more, than, five, centuries, ever, since, the, conquest, of, the, canary, islands, there, are, also, several, other, religious, communities, the, overwhelming, majority, of, native, canarians, are, roman, catholic, 76, 7, with, various, smaller, foreign, born, populations, of, other, christian, beliefs, such, as, protestants, the, appearance, of, the, virgin, of, candelaria, patron, of, canary, islands, was, credited, with, moving, the, canary, islands, toward, christianity, two, catholic, saints, were, born, in, the, canary, islands, peter, of, saint, joseph, de, betancur, and, jos, de, anchieta, both, born, on, the, island, of, tenerife, they, were, respectively, missionaries, in, guatemala, and, brazil, the, canary, islands, are, divided, into, two, catholic, dioceses, each, governed, by, a, bishop, separate, from, the, overwhelming, catholic, majority, are, a, minority, of, muslims, among, the, followers, of, islam, the, islamic, federation, of, the, canary, islands, exists, to, represent, the, islamic, community, in, the, canary, islands, as, well, as, to, provide, practical, support, to, members, of, the, islamic, community, for, its, part, there, is, also, the, evangelical, council, of, the, canary, islands, in, the, archipelago, other, religious, faiths, represented, include, jehovah, s, witnesses, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, as, well, as, hinduism, minority, religions, are, also, present, such, as, the, church, of, the, guanche, people, which, is, classified, as, a, neo, pagan, native, religion, also, present, are, buddhism, judaism, bah, african, religion, and, chinese, religions, the, distribution, of, beliefs, in, 2012, according, to, the, cis, barometer, autonomy, was, as, follows, the, economy, is, based, primarily, on, tourism, which, makes, up, 32, of, the, gdp, the, canaries, receive, about, 12, million, tourists, per, year, construction, makes, up, nearly, 20, of, the, gdp, and, tropical, agriculture, primarily, bananas, and, tobacco, are, grown, for, export, to, europe, and, the, americas, ecologists, are, concerned, that, the, resources, especially, in, the, more, arid, islands, are, being, overexploited, but, there, are, still, many, agricultural, resources, like, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, cochineal, sugarcane, grapes, vines, dates, oranges, lemons, figs, wheat, barley, maize, apricots, peaches, and, almonds, water, resources, are, also, being, overexploited, due, to, the, high, water, usage, by, tourists, also, some, islands, such, as, gran, canaria, and, tenerife, overexploit, the, ground, water, this, is, done, in, such, degree, that, according, to, european, and, spanish, legal, regulations, the, current, situation, is, not, acceptable, to, address, the, problems, good, governance, and, a, change, in, the, water, use, paradigm, have, been, proposed, these, solutions, depend, largely, on, controlling, water, use, and, on, demand, management, as, this, is, administratively, difficult, and, politically, unpalatable, most, action, is, currently, directed, at, increasing, the, public, offer, of, water, through, import, from, outside, a, decision, which, is, economically, politically, and, environmentally, questionable, to, bring, in, revenue, for, environmental, protection, innovation, training, and, water, sanitation, a, tourist, tax, was, considered, in, 2018, along, with, a, doubling, of, the, ecotax, and, restrictions, on, holiday, rents, in, the, zones, with, the, greatest, pressure, of, demand, the, economy, is, 25, billion, 2001, gdp, figures, the, islands, experienced, continuous, growth, during, a, 20, year, period, up, until, 2001, at, a, rate, of, approximately, 5, annually, this, growth, was, fueled, mainly, by, huge, amounts, of, foreign, direct, investment, mostly, to, develop, tourism, real, estate, hotels, and, apartments, and, european, funds, near, 11, billion, in, the, period, from, 2000, to, 2007, since, the, canary, islands, are, labelled, region, objective, 1, eligible, for, euro, structural, funds, additionally, the, eu, allows, the, canary, islands, government, to, offer, special, tax, concessions, for, investors, who, incorporate, under, the, zona, especial, canaria, zec, regime, and, create, more, than, five, jobs, spain, gave, permission, in, august, 2014, for, repsol, and, its, partners, to, explore, oil, and, natural, gas, prospects, off, the, canary, islands, involving, an, investment, of, 7, 5, billion, over, four, years, to, commence, at, the, end, of, 2016, repsol, at, the, time, said, the, area, could, ultimately, produce, 100, 000, barrels, of, oil, a, day, which, would, meet, 10, percent, of, spain, s, energy, needs, however, the, analysis, of, samples, obtained, did, not, show, the, necessary, volume, nor, quality, to, consider, future,
