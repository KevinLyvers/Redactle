southern, africa, is, the, southernmost, region, of, africa, no, definition, is, agreed, upon, but, some, groupings, include, the, united, nations, geoscheme, the, intergovernmental, southern, african, development, community, and, the, physical, geography, definition, based, on, the, physical, characteristics, of, the, land, defined, by, physical, geography, southern, africa, is, home, to, a, number, of, river, systems, the, zambezi, river, is, the, most, prominent, the, zambezi, flows, from, the, northwest, corner, of, zambia, and, western, angola, to, the, indian, ocean, on, the, coast, of, mozambique, along, the, way, it, flows, over, victoria, falls, on, the, border, between, zambia, and, zimbabwe, victoria, falls, is, one, of, the, largest, waterfalls, in, the, world, and, a, major, tourist, attraction, for, the, region, southern, africa, includes, both, subtropical, and, temperate, climates, with, the, tropic, of, capricorn, running, through, the, middle, of, the, region, dividing, it, into, its, subtropical, and, temperate, halves, countries, commonly, included, in, southern, africa, include, angola, botswana, the, comoros, eswatini, lesotho, madagascar, malawi, mauritius, mozambique, namibia, south, africa, zambia, and, zimbabwe, in, cultural, geography, the, island, country, of, madagascar, is, often, not, included, due, to, its, distinct, language, and, cultural, heritage, in, physical, geography, the, geographical, delineation, for, the, subregion, is, the, portion, of, africa, south, of, the, cunene, and, zambezi, rivers, botswana, eswatini, lesotho, namibia, south, africa, zimbabwe, and, the, part, of, mozambique, that, lies, south, of, the, zambezi, river, that, definition, is, most, often, used, in, south, africa, for, natural, sciences, and, particularly, in, guidebooks, such, as, roberts, birds, of, southern, africa, the, southern, african, bird, atlas, project, and, mammals, of, the, southern, african, subregion, it, is, not, used, in, political, economic, or, human, geography, contexts, because, the, definition, cuts, mozambique, in, two, in, the, united, nations, geoscheme, for, africa, five, states, constitute, southern, africa, this, definition, excludes, other, countries, in, the, region, and, instead, includes, the, comoros, madagascar, malawi, mauritius, mayotte, mozambique, r, union, the, scattered, islands, in, the, indian, ocean, as, a, part, of, the, french, southern, territories, zambia, and, zimbabwe, in, eastern, africa, angola, in, middle, africa, or, central, africa, and, saint, helena, ascension, and, tristan, da, cunha, under, the, name, saint, helena, in, western, africa, instead, some, atlases, include, malawi, zambia, and, zimbabwe, in, central, africa, instead, of, southern, or, eastern, africa, the, southern, african, customs, union, created, in, 1969, also, comprises, the, five, states, in, the, un, subregion, of, southern, africa, the, southern, african, development, community, sadc, was, established, in, 1980, to, facilitate, co, operation, in, the, region, it, includes, other, than, the, un, subregion, these, countries, and, territories, are, often, included, in, southern, africa, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, is, generally, included, in, central, africa, while, seychelles, and, tanzania, are, more, commonly, associated, with, eastern, africa, but, these, three, countries, have, occasionally, been, included, in, southern, africa, as, they, are, the, sadc, members, the, terrain, of, southern, africa, is, varied, ranging, from, forest, and, grasslands, to, deserts, the, region, has, both, low, lying, coastal, areas, and, mountains, in, terms, of, natural, resources, the, region, has, the, world, s, largest, resources, of, platinum, and, the, platinum, group, elements, chromium, vanadium, and, cobalt, as, well, as, uranium, gold, copper, titanium, iron, manganese, silver, beryllium, and, diamonds, southern, africa, is, set, apart, from, other, sub, saharan, african, regions, because, of, its, mineral, resources, including, copper, diamonds, gold, zinc, chromium, platinum, manganese, iron, ore, and, coal, countries, in, southern, africa, are, larger, in, geographic, area, except, three, smaller, landlocked, states, lesotho, swaziland, and, malawi, the, larger, states, south, africa, botswana, mozambique, zimbabwe, zambia, namibia, and, angola, all, have, extensive, mineral, deposits, these, widespread, mineral, resources, make, this, one, of, the, wealthiest, regions, of, africa, with, the, greatest, potential, for, economic, growth, a, chain, of, mineral, resources, in, southern, africa, stretches, from, the, rich, oil, fields, in, northwest, angola, east, through, the, central, diamond, mining, region, in, huambo, province, and, into, the, copper, belt, region, of, zambia, and, congo, a, region, of, rich, mineral, deposits, continues, to, the, south, called, the, great, dyke, in, central, zimbabwe, through, the, bushveld, basin, into, south, africa, this, extends, southwest, through, the, witwatersrand, and, northern, cape, of, south, africa, toward, the, southern, coast, mining, activity, exists, across, the, eastern, region, diamond, mining, is, found, in, parts, of, botswana, and, along, the, namibian, coast, coal, can, also, be, found, in, central, mozambique, zimbabwe, and, northeast, south, africa, the, climate, of, the, region, is, broadly, divided, into, subtropical, in, the, north, and, temperate, in, the, south, but, also, includes, humid, subtropical, mediterranean, climate, highland, subtropical, oceanic, desert, and, semi, arid, regions, except, for, lower, parts, of, zambia, and, interior, areas, of, namibia, and, botswana, the, region, rarely, suffers, from, extreme, heat, in, addition, the, winter, presents, mostly, as, mild, and, dry, except, in, the, southwest, cool, southeasterly, winds, and, high, humidity, bring, cool, conditions, in, the, winter, the, namib, desert, is, the, driest, area, in, the, region, altitude, plays, an, outsize, role, in, moderating, the, temperatures, of, the, south, african, highveld, lesotho, and, much, of, zambia, and, zimbabwe, the, prairie, region, of, central, and, northeast, south, africa, the, country, of, zimbabwe, and, parts, of, zambia, are, known, as, the, veldt, divided, into, the, bushveld, and, highveld, there, are, high, temperatures, and, low, rainfall, within, the, zambezi, and, limpopo, river, valleys, probably, due, to, the, lower, altitude, the, western, cape, has, a, mediterranean, vegetation, and, climate, including, the, unique, fynbos, grading, eastward, into, an, oceanic, climate, along, the, garden, route, to, gqeberha, and, east, london, the, namib, and, kalahari, deserts, form, arid, lands, in, the, centre, west, separating, the, highlands, woodlands, croplands, and, pastures, of, the, wetter, and, higher, east, from, the, atlantic, ocean, in, addition, the, drakensberg, and, eastern, highlands, separate, the, highland, areas, and, coastal, plains, centred, on, mozambique, in, the, north, and, kwazulu, natal, in, the, south, the, latter,

south, africa, and, zimbabwe, across, most, of, southern, africa, apart, from, the, western, cape, in, south, africa, the, major, rainfall, season, is, during, the, southern, hemisphere, summer, from, december, to, february, in, the, western, cape, the, rainfall, maximum, occurs, from, june, through, august, there, are, a, number, of, important, rainfall, producing, weather, systems, in, southern, africa, these, include, tropical, extra, tropical, cloud, bands, tropical, lows, and, tropical, cyclones, cut, off, lows, and, mesoscale, convective, systems, winter, midlatitude, storms, account, for, the, june, august, rainfall, maximum, in, the, western, cape, year, to, year, variability, in, rainfall, including, drought, is, associated, with, changes, in, global, and, regional, sea, surface, temperatures, these, include, the, el, nino, southern, oscillation, the, subtropical, indian, ocean, dipole, and, changes, in, the, benguela, current, region, in, the, southeast, atlantic, future, climate, projections, suggest, that, much, of, southern, africa, will, get, hotter, and, drier, in, response, to, global, climate, change, east, and, southern, africa, are, among, the, earliest, regions, where, modern, humans, homo, sapiens, and, their, predecessors, are, believed, to, have, lived, in, september, 2019, scientists, reported, the, computerized, determination, based, on, 260, ct, scans, of, a, virtual, skull, shape, of, the, last, common, human, ancestor, to, modern, humans, representative, of, the, earliest, modern, humans, and, suggested, that, modern, humans, arose, between, 350, 000, and, 260, 000, years, ago, through, a, merging, of, populations, in, east, and, south, africa, the, kingdom, of, mapungubwe, c, 1075, c, 1220, was, one, of, the, earliest, state, in, the, south, african, region, it, was, located, at, between, the, shashe, and, limpopo, rivers, the, name, is, derived, from, either, tjikalanga, and, tshivenda, the, kingdom, is, thought, to, have, existed, as, the, first, class, based, social, system, within, the, region, society, was, mainly, centered, around, family, and, farming, the, kingdom, would, culminate, to, the, kingdom, of, zimbabwe, in, the, 13th, century, and, at, its, height, the, capital, s, population, was, about, 5000, people, there, are, no, written, records, from, the, kingdom, and, what, historians, and, archeologists, know, of, the, state, is, from, the, remains, of, buildings, the, kingdom, of, zimbabwe, c, 1220, 1450, was, a, shona, karanga, kingdom, in, what, is, today, zimbabwe, the, capital, which, sits, near, present, day, masvingo, is, located, at, great, zimbabwe, which, are, the, largest, stone, structure, in, precolonial, southern, africa, this, kingdom, came, after, the, collapse, of, the, kingdom, of, mapungubwe, during, the, decline, of, the, kingdom, of, zimbabwe, two, powers, emerged, one, in, the, north, kingdom, of, mutapa, from, 1430, 1760, which, had, improved, on, zimbabwe, s, administrative, structure, and, the, other, in, the, south, kingdom, of, butua, from, 1450, 1683, which, was, a, smaller, entity, than, the, former, two, the, kingdom, was, governed, by, the, torwa, dynasty, and, its, capital, was, situated, at, khami, both, states, would, eventually, be, absorbed, by, the, powerful, shona, state, the, rozwi, empire, by, 1683, the, economy, was, based, on, cattle, herding, farming, and, gold, mining, the, empire, lasted, until, 1866, which, came, after, droughts, and, instability, the, mthethwa, paramountcy, was, an, african, state, that, emerged, in, the, late, 18th, century, in, the, region, of, present, day, kwazulu, natal, the, state, was, consolidated, and, extended, under, the, rule, of, dingiswayo, who, produced, a, disciplined, and, highly, organised, army, for, the, first, time, in, the, region, the, zulu, kingdom, rose, under, the, leadership, of, shaka, and, covered, most, of, present, day, kwazulu, natal, in, the, 19th, century, internal, conflict, arose, in, the, 1820s, between, shaka, s, half, brothers, dingane, and, mhlangana, due, to, a, succession, dispute, boer, settlers, began, arriving, northwards, of, the, orange, river, in, the, 1830s, which, led, to, conflicts, between, the, two, peoples, and, resulted, in, the, battle, of, blood, river, in, 1838, the, kingdom, fell, during, the, anglo, zulu, war, of, the, late, 19th, century, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, the, colonial, powers, came, under, international, pressure, to, decolonize, the, transfer, to, an, african, majority, however, was, complicated, by, the, settlement, of, white, peoples, after, an, initial, phase, from, 1945, to, 1958, as, a, consolidation, of, white, power, decolonization, succeeded, in, its, achievement, when, high, commission, territories, and, overseas, departments, such, as, zambia, malawi, botswana, lesotho, mauritius, swaziland, madagascar, and, the, comoros, became, independent, states, from, british, and, french, rule, the, brutal, struggle, for, independence, in, the, colonial, territories, led, to, the, independence, of, new, states, of, angola, and, mozambique, as, well, as, southern, rhodesia, which, declared, independence, as, zimbabwe, in, 1980, the, denouement, of, south, west, africa, achieved, independence, as, namibia, in, 1990, and, the, black, majority, in, south, africa, took, power, after, the, democratic, elections, in, 1994, therefore, ending, the, apartheid, regime, from, the, end, of, the, period, of, colonial, rule, imperial, interests, controlled, the, economies, of, the, region, and, south, africa, became, the, dominant, economic, power, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, 21st, century, has, seen, attempts, to, create, unity, among, nations, in, southern, africa, in, spite, of, democracy, violence, inequality, and, poverty, still, persist, throughout, the, region, the, region, is, distinct, from, the, rest, of, africa, with, a, robust, mining, sector, and, comparatively, developed, secondary, and, tertiary, sectors, additionally, many, countries, with, the, exception, of, mozambique, and, malawi, in, particular, have, relatively, well, developed, infrastructure, some, of, its, main, exports, including, platinum, diamonds, gold, copper, cobalt, chromium, and, uranium, southern, africa, still, faces, some, of, the, problems, that, the, rest, of, the, continent, does, despite, this, diamond, production, has, fueled, the, economies, of, botswana, and, namibia, for, example, over, the, 20th, century, the, region, developed, a, robust, manufacturing, sector, focused, on, south, africa, and, zimbabwe, which, allowed, greater, prosperity, and, investments, into, infrastructure, education, and, healthcare, that, elevated, both, nations, into, middle, income, economies, and, captured, growing, markets, across, africa, however, since, the, 1990s, these, industries, have, struggled, in, the, face, of, globalization, and, cheaper, imports, from, china, leading, to, job, losses, particularly, in, heavy, industry, gold, mining, and, textiles, zimbabwe, in, particular, has, seen, significant, deindustrialization, as, a, result, of, factors, both, domestic, and, foreign, while, colonialism, has, left, its, mark, on, the, development, over, the, course, of, history, today, poverty, corruption, and, hiv, aids, are, some, of, the, biggest, factors, impeding, economic, growth, in, addition, south, africa, and, zimbabwe, in, particular, face, high, emigration, among, their, skilled, workers, leading, to, a, significant, brain, drain, to, western, economies, and, billions, lost, in, human, capital, flight, the, pursuit, of, economic, and, political, stability, is, an, important, part, of, the, region, s, goals, as, demonstrated, by, the, sadc, however, complete, regional, integration, remains, an, elusive, target, in, terms, of, economic, strength, south, africa, is, the, dominant, economy, of, the, region, generally, mining, agriculture, the, public, sector, and, tourism, dominate, the, economies, of, southern, african, countries, apart, from, south, africa, which, has, mature, and, flourishing, financial, retail, and, construction, sectors, zimbabwe, maintains, a, smaller, banking, and, real, estate, sector, along, with, what, remains, of, its, manufacturing, industry, despite, a, protracted, economic, crisis, most, global, banks, have, their, regional, offices, for, southern, africa, based, in, johannesburg, over, the, years, some, the, other, southern, african, nations, have, invested, in, economic, diversification, and, invested, public, funds, into, rail, road, and, air, transportation, as, part, of, a, concerted, effort, through, sadc, to, boost, regional, trade, and, improve, communication, and, transportation, the, countries, in, this, region, also, belong, to, the, southern, africa, power, pool, which, facilitates, the, development, of, a, competitive, electricity, market, within, the, sadc, region, and, ensures, sustainable, energy, developments, through, sound, economic, environmental, and, social, practices, the, main, objective, of, the, power, pool, is, to, develop, a, world, class, robust, and, safe, interconnected, electrical, system, across, the, southern, african, region, according, to, a, report, by, southern, africa, power, pool, the, three, largest, producers, of, electricity, in, southern, africa, as, at, 2017, include, eskom, in, south, africa, with, an, estimated, 46, 963mw, zesco, in, zambia, with, 2, 877mw, and, snl, of, angola, with, 2, 442mw, whilst, moderately, successful, by, african, standards, the, region, largely, lags, behind, their, asian, counterparts, in, innovation, foreign, direct, investment, stem, sciences, and, research, and, development, southern, africa, has, a, wide, diversity, of, ecoregions, including, grassland, bushveld, karoo, savannah, and, riparian, zones, even, though, considerable, disturbance, has, occurred, in, some, regions, from, habitat, loss, due, to, human, population, density, or, export, focused, development, there, remain, significant, numbers, of, various, wildlife, species, including, white, rhino, lion, african, leopard, impala, kudu, blue, wildebeest, vervet, monkey, and, elephant, it, has, complex, plateaus, that, create, massive, mountain, structures, along, the, south, african, border, there, are, numerous, environmental, issues, in, southern, africa, including, air, pollution, and, desertification, southern, africa, is, home, to, many, people, it, was, initially, populated, by, san, hottentots, and, pygmies, in, widely, dispersed, concentrations, due, to, the, bantu, expansion, the, majority, of, african, ethnic, groups, in, this, region, including, the, xhosa, zulu, tsonga, swazi, northern, ndebele, southern, ndebele, tswana, sotho, pedi, mbundu, ovimbundu, shona, chaga, and, sukuma, speak, bantu, languages, the, process, of, colonization, and, settling, resulted, in, a, small, population, of, european, afrikaner, british, portuguese, africans, etc, and, asian, descent, cape, malays, indian, south, africans, etc, people, in, many, southern, african, countries, further, information, in, the, sections, of, architecture, of, africa, further, information, in, the, sections, of, history, of, science, and, technology, in, africa, some, key, factors, affecting, the, food, security, within, the, regions, including, political, instability, poor, governance, droughts, population, growth, urbanisation, poverty, low, economic, growth, inadequate, agricultural, policies, trade, terms, and, regimes, resource, degradation, and, the, recent, increase, in, hiv, aids, these, factors, vary, from, country, to, country, for, example, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, has, favourable, climatic, and, physical, conditions, but, performs, far, below, its, capacity, in, food, provision, due, to, political, instability, and, poor, governance, in, contrast, semi, arid, countries, such, as, botswana, and, namibia, produce, insufficient, food, but, successfully, achieve, food, security, through, food, imports, due, to, economic, growth, political, stability, and, good, governance, the, republic, of, south, africa, is, a, major, food, producer, and, exporter, in, the, region, data, on, agricultural, production, trends, and, food, insecurity, especially, in, term, of, food, availability, for, southern, africa, is, readily, available, through, the, famine, early, warning, systems, network, fews, net, and, southern, african, development, community, sadc, food, agriculture, and, nature, resource, directorate, farn, however, this, data, might, not, fully, capture, the, reality, of, a, region, with, large, urban, populations, and, where, food, insecurity, goes, beyond, per, capita, availability, to, issues, of, access, and, dietary, adequacy, urban, food, security, has, been, noted, as, an, emerging, area, of, concern, in, the, region, with, recent, data, showing, high, levels, of, food, insecurity, amongst, low, income, households, in, a, study, of, eleven, cities, in, nine, countries, blantyre, cape, town, gaborone, harare, johannesburg, lusaka, maputo, manzini, maseru, durban, and, windhoek, only, 17, of, households, were, categorized, as, food, secure, while, more, than, half, 57, of, all, households, surveyed, were, found, to, be, severely, food, insecure, some, factors, affecting, urban, food, insecurity, include, climate, change, with, potential, impact, on, agricultural, productivity, the, expansion, of, supermarkets, in, the, region, which, is, changing, the, way, people, obtain, food, in, the, city, rural, to, urban, migration, unemployment, and, poverty, the, issue, of, food, insecurity, in, general, and, urban, food, insecurity, in, particular, in, the, region, is, also, characterized, by, an, increased, consumption, of, caloric, junk, food, and, processed, foods, leading, to, potential, increase, in, the, co, existence, of, undernutrition, and, dietary, related, chronic, diseases, such, as, obesity, and, hypertension, in, south, africa, for, example, while, over, 50, experience, hunger, 61, are, overweight, or, morbidly, obese, there, is, only, limited, data, on, the, other, southern, african, countries, from, 2018, to, 2021, parts, of, the, region, suffered, from, a, period, of, drought
