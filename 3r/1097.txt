geographical, location, in, what, used, to, be, wet, peatland, the, founding, of, amsterdam, is, later, than, other, urban, centres, in, the, low, countries, however, around, the, area, of, what, later, became, amsterdam, farmers, settled, as, early, as, three, millennia, ago, they, lived, along, the, prehistoric, ij, river, and, upstream, of, its, tributary, amstel, the, prehistoric, ij, was, a, shallow, and, quiet, stream, in, peatland, behind, beach, ridges, this, secluded, area, was, able, to, grow, into, an, important, local, settlement, centre, especially, in, the, late, bronze, age, the, iron, age, and, the, roman, age, neolithic, and, roman, artefacts, have, also, been, found, in, the, prehistoric, amstel, bedding, under, amsterdam, s, damrak, and, rokin, such, as, shards, of, bell, beaker, culture, pottery, 2200, 2000, bc, and, a, granite, grinding, stone, 2700, 2750, bc, but, the, location, of, these, artefacts, around, the, river, banks, of, the, amstel, probably, point, to, a, presence, of, a, modest, semi, permanent, or, seasonal, settlement, until, water, issues, were, controlled, a, permanent, settlement, would, not, have, been, possible, since, the, river, mouth, and, the, banks, of, the, amstel, in, this, period, in, time, were, too, wet, for, permanent, habitation, the, origins, of, amsterdam, are, linked, to, the, development, of, a, dam, on, the, amstel, river, called, amestelle, meaning, watery, area, from, aa, m, river, stelle, site, at, a, shoreline, river, bank, in, this, area, land, reclamation, started, as, early, as, the, late, 10th, century, amestelle, was, located, along, a, side, arm, of, the, ij, this, side, arm, took, the, name, from, the, eponymous, land, amstel, amestelle, was, inhabited, by, farmers, who, lived, more, inland, and, more, upstream, where, the, land, was, not, as, wet, as, at, the, banks, of, the, downstream, river, mouth, these, farmers, were, starting, the, reclamation, around, upstream, ouderkerk, aan, de, amstel, and, later, at, the, other, side, of, the, river, at, amstelveen, the, van, amstel, family, known, in, documents, by, this, name, since, 1019, held, the, stewardship, in, this, northwestern, nook, of, the, ecclesiastical, district, of, the, bishop, of, utrecht, the, family, later, served, also, under, the, count, of, holland, a, major, turning, point, in, the, development, of, the, amstel, river, mouth, was, the, all, saint, s, flood, of, 1170, in, an, extremely, short, period, of, time, the, shallow, river, ij, turned, into, a, wide, estuary, which, from, then, on, offered, the, amstel, an, open, connection, to, the, zuiderzee, ijssel, and, waterways, further, afield, this, made, the, water, flow, of, the, amstel, more, active, so, excess, water, could, be, drained, better, with, drier, banks, the, downstream, amstel, mouth, became, attractive, for, permanent, habitation, moreover, the, river, had, grown, from, an, insignificant, peat, stream, into, a, junction, of, international, waterways, a, settlement, was, built, here, immediately, after, the, landscape, change, of, 1170, right, from, the, start, of, its, foundation, it, focused, on, traffic, production, and, trade, not, on, farming, as, opposed, to, how, communities, had, lived, further, upstream, for, the, past, 200, years, and, northward, for, thousands, of, years, the, construction, of, a, dam, at, the, mouth, of, the, amstel, eponymously, named, dam, is, historically, estimated, to, have, occurred, between, 1264, and, 1275, the, settlement, first, appeared, in, a, document, from, 1275, concerning, a, road, toll, granted, by, the, count, of, holland, floris, v, to, the, residents, apud, amestelledamme, at, the, dam, in, the, amstel, or, at, the, dam, of, amstelland, this, allowed, the, inhabitants, of, the, village, to, travel, freely, through, the, county, of, holland, paying, no, tolls, at, bridges, locks, and, dams, this, was, a, move, in, a, years, long, struggle, for, power, in, the, area, between, the, count, of, holland, and, the, amstel, family, who, governed, the, area, on, behalf, of, the, bishop, of, utrecht, by, 1327, the, name, had, developed, into, aemsterdam, the, bishop, of, utrecht, granted, amsterdam, zone, rights, in, either, 1300, or, 1306, the, mirakel, van, amsterdam, in, 1345, rendered, the, city, an, important, place, of, pilgrimage, during, the, heyday, of, the, stille, omgang, which, became, the, expression, of, the, pilgrimage, after, the, protestant, reformation, up, to, 90, 000, pilgrims, came, to, amsterdam, from, the, 14th, century, on, amsterdam, flourished, largely, from, trade, with, the, hanseatic, league, from, the, 15th, century, on, the, city, established, an, independent, trade, route, with, the, baltic, sea, in, grain, and, timber, cutting, out, the, hanseatic, league, as, middlemen, the, city, became, the, staple, market, of, europe, for, bulk, cargo, this, was, made, possible, due, to, innovations, in, the, herring, fishery, from, which, amsterdam, reaped, great, wealth, herring, had, demand, in, markets, all, around, europe, inventions, of, on, board, gibbing, and, the, haringbuis, in, 1415, made, longer, voyages, feasible, and, hence, enabled, dutch, fishermen, to, follow, the, herring, shoals, far, from, the, coasts, giving, them, a, monopoly, in, the, industry, the, herring, industry, relied, on, international, trade, cooperation, and, large, initial, investments, in, ships, which, needed, many, highly, skilled, and, unskilled, workers, cooperating, which, required, the, import, of, the, necessary, raw, materials, to, turn, an, unfinished, product, into, a, marketable, one, which, required, merchants, to, then, sell, it, throughout, the, continent, and, book, keepers, and, accountants, to, divide, the, profit, in, short, the, herring, industry, was, setting, up, the, foundations, for, what, would, later, become, the, transcontinental, trade, system, and, the, dutch, golden, age, with, amsterdam, at, its, centre, hence, the, saying, amsterdam, is, built, on, herring, bones, the, low, countries, were, part, of, the, hapsburg, inheritance, and, came, under, the, spanish, monarchy, in, the, early, sixteenth, century, the, dutch, rebelled, against, philip, ii, of, spain, who, led, a, defense, of, catholicism, during, the, protestant, reformation, the, main, reasons, for, the, uprising, were, the, imposition, of, new, taxes, the, tenth, penny, and, the, religious, persecution, of, protestants, by, the, newly, introduced, inquisition, the, revolt, escalated, into, the, eighty, years, war, which, ultimately, led, to, dutch, independence, strongly, pushed, by, dutch, revolt, leader, william, the, silent, the, dutch, republic, became, known, for, its, relative, religious, tolerance, jews, from, the, iberian, peninsula, protestant, huguenots, from, france, prosperous, merchants, and, printers, from, flanders, and, economic, and, religious, refugees, from, the, spanish, controlled, parts, of, the, low, countries, found, safety, in, amsterdam, the, influx, of, flemish, printers, and, the, city, s, intellectual, tolerance, made, amsterdam, a, centre, for, the, european, free, press, during, the, 17th, century, amsterdam, experienced, what, is, considered, its, golden, age, during, which, it, became, the, wealthiest, city, in, the, western, world, ships, sailed, from, amsterdam, to, the, baltic, sea, the, caribbean, north, america, and, africa, as, well, as, present, day, indonesia, india, sri, lanka, and, brazil, forming, the, basis, of, a, worldwide, trading, network, amsterdam, s, merchants, had, the, largest, share, in, both, the, dutch, east, india, company, voc, and, the, dutch, west, india, company, these, companies, acquired, overseas, possessions, that, later, became, dutch, colonies, amsterdam, was, europe, s, most, important, hub, for, the, shipment, of, goods, and, was, the, leading, financial, centre, of, the, western, world, in, 1602, the, amsterdam, office, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, became, the, world, s, first, stock, exchange, by, trading, in, its, own, shares, the, bank, of, amsterdam, started, operations, in, 1609, acting, as, a, full, service, bank, for, dutch, merchant, bankers, and, as, a, reserve, bank, from, the, 17th, century, onwards, amsterdam, also, became, involved, in, the, atlantic, slave, trade, the, city, was, a, major, destination, port, for, dutch, slave, ships, participating, in, the, triangular, trade, which, lasted, until, the, united, netherlands, abolished, the, netherlands, involvement, in, the, trade, in, 1814, at, the, request, of, the, british, government, amsterdam, was, also, a, member, of, the, society, of, suriname, an, organisation, founded, to, oversee, the, management, of, the, dutch, colony, of, surinam, which, was, economically, dependent, on, slave, plantations, on, 1, july, 2021, the, mayor, of, amsterdam, femke, halsema, apologised, for, the, city, s, involvement, in, the, slave, trade, amsterdam, s, prosperity, declined, during, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, the, wars, of, the, dutch, republic, with, england, latterly, great, britain, and, france, took, their, toll, on, the, city, during, the, french, revolutionary, wars, and, the, napoleonic, wars, amsterdam, s, significance, reached, its, lowest, point, with, holland, being, absorbed, into, the, french, empire, however, the, later, establishment, of, the, united, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, in, 1815, marked, a, turning, point, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, is, sometimes, called, amsterdam, s, second, golden, age, new, museums, a, railway, station, and, the, concertgebouw, were, built, at, the, same, time, the, industrial, revolution, reached, the, city, the, amsterdam, rhine, canal, was, dug, to, give, amsterdam, a, direct, connection, to, the, rhine, and, the, north, sea, canal, was, dug, to, give, the, port, a, shorter, connection, to, the, north, sea, both, projects, dramatically, improved, commerce, with, the, rest, of, europe, and, the, world, in, 1906, joseph, conrad, gave, a, brief, description, of, amsterdam, as, seen, from, the, seaside, in, the, mirror, of, the, sea, shortly, before, the, first, world, war, the, city, started, to, expand, again, and, new, suburbs, were, built, even, though, the, netherlands, remained, neutral, in, this, war, amsterdam, suffered, a, food, shortage, and, heating, fuel, became, scarce, the, shortages, sparked, riots, in, which, several, people, were, killed, these, riots, are, known, as, the, aardappeloproer, potato, rebellion, people, started, looting, stores, and, warehouses, to, get, supplies, mainly, food, on, 1, january, 1921, after, a, flood, in, 1916, the, depleted, municipalities, of, durgerdam, holysloot, zunderdorp, and, schellingwoude, all, lying, north, of, amsterdam, were, at, their, own, request, annexed, to, the, city,

invaded, the, netherlands, on, 10, may, 1940, and, took, control, of, the, country, some, amsterdam, citizens, sheltered, jews, thereby, exposing, themselves, and, their, families, to, a, high, risk, of, being, imprisoned, or, sent, to, concentration, camps, more, than, 100, 000, dutch, jews, were, deported, to, nazi, concentration, camps, of, whom, some, 60, 000, lived, in, amsterdam, in, response, the, dutch, communist, party, organized, the, february, strike, attended, by, 300, 000, people, to, protest, against, the, raids, the, most, famous, deportee, was, the, young, jewish, girl, anne, frank, who, died, in, the, bergen, belsen, concentration, camp, at, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, communication, with, the, rest, of, the, country, broke, down, and, food, and, fuel,

may, 1945, shortly, before, the, end, of, the, war, in, europe, many, new, suburbs, such, as, osdorp, slotervaart, slotermeer, and, geuzenveld, were, built, in, the, years, after, the, second, world, war, these, suburbs, contained, many, public, parks, and, wide, open, spaces, and, the, new, buildings, provided, improved, housing, conditions, with, larger, and, brighter, rooms, gardens, and, balconies, because, of, the, war, and, other, events, of, the, 20th, century, almost, the, entire, city, centre, had, fallen, into, disrepair, as, society, was, changing, politicians, and, other, influential, figures, made, plans, to, redesign, large, parts, of, it, there, was, an, increasing, demand, for, office, buildings, and, also, for, new, roads, as, the, automobile, became, available, to, most, people, a, metro, started, operating, in, 1977, between, the, new, suburb, of, bijlmermeer, in, the, city, s, zuidoost, southeast, exclave, and, the, centre, of, amsterdam, further, plans, were, to, build, a, new, highway, above, the, metro, to, connect, amsterdam, centraal, and, the, city, centre, with, other, parts, of, the, city, the, required, large, scale, demolitions, began, in, amsterdam, s, former, jewish, neighborhood, smaller, streets, such, as, the, jodenbreestraat, and, weesperstraat, were, widened, and, almost, all, houses, and, buildings, were, demolished, at, the, peak, of, the, demolition, the, nieuwmarktrellen, nieuwmarkt, riots, broke, out, the, rioters, expressed, their, fury, about, the, demolition, caused, by, the, restructuring, of, the, city, as, a, result, the, demolition, was, stopped, and, the, highway, into, the, city, s, centre, was, never, fully, built, only, the, metro, was, completed, only, a, few, streets, remained, widened, the, new, city, hall, was, built, on, the, almost, completely, demolished, waterlooplein, meanwhile, large, private, organizations, such, as, stadsherstel, amsterdam, were, founded, to, restore, the, entire, city, centre, although, the, success, of, this, struggle, is, visible, today, efforts, for, further, restoration, are, still, ongoing, the, entire, city, centre, has, reattained, its, former, splendour, and, as, a, whole, is, now, a, protected, area, many, of, its, buildings, have, become, monuments, and, in, july, 2010, the, grachtengordel, the, three, concentric, canals, herengracht, keizersgracht, and, prinsengracht, was, added, to, the, unesco, world, heritage, list, in, the, 21st, century, the, amsterdam, city, centre, has, attracted, large, numbers, of, tourists, between, 2012, and, 2015, the, annual, number, of, visitors, rose, from, 10, to, 17, million, real, estate, prices, have, surged, and, local, shops, are, making, way, for, tourist, oriented, ones, making, the, centre, unaffordable, for, the, city, s, inhabitants, these, developments, have, evoked, comparisons, with, venice, a, city, thought, to, be, overwhelmed, by, the, tourist, influx, construction, of, a, new, metro, line, connecting, the, part, of, the, city, north, of, the, ij, to, its, southern, part, was, started, in, 2003, the, project, was, controversial, because, its, cost, had, exceeded, its, budget, by, a, factor, of, three, by, 2008, because, of, fears, of, damage, to, buildings, in, the, centre, and, because, construction, had, to, be, halted, and, restarted, multiple, times, the, new, metro, line, was, completed, in, 2018, since, 2014, renewed, focus, has, been, given, to, urban, regeneration, and, renewal, especially, in, areas, directly, bordering, the, city, centre, such, as, frederik, hendrikbuurt, this, urban, renewal, and, expansion, of, the, traditional, centre, of, the, city, with, the, construction, on, artificial, islands, of, the, new, eastern, ijburg,

which, is, not, amsterdam, but, rather, haarlem, the, river, amstel, ends, in, the, city, centre, and, connects, to, a, large, number, of, canals, that, eventually, terminate, in, the, ij, amsterdam, s, elevation, is, about, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, below, sea, level, the, surrounding, land, is, flat, as, it, is, formed, of, large, polders, an, artificial, forest, amsterdamse, bos, is, in, the, southwest, amsterdam, is, connected, to, the, north, sea, through, the, long, north, sea, canal, amsterdam, is, intensely, urbanised, as, is, the, amsterdam, metropolitan, area, surrounding, the, city, comprising, 219, 4, km, 2, 84, 7, sq, mi, of, land, the, city, proper, has, 4, 457, inhabitants, per, km, 2, and, 2, 275, houses, per, km, 2, parks, and, nature, reserves, make, up, 12, of, amsterdam, s, land, area, amsterdam, has, more, than, 100, km, 60, mi, of, canals, most, of, which, are, navigable, by, boat, the, city, s, three, main, canals, are, the, prinsengracht, the, herengracht, and, the, keizersgracht, in, the, middle, ages, amsterdam, was, surrounded, by, a, moat, called, the, singel, which, now, forms, the, innermost, ring, in, the, city, and, gives, the, city, centre, a, horseshoe, shape, the, city, is, also, served, by, a, seaport, it, has, been, compared, with, venice, due, to, its, division, into, about, 90, islands, which, are, linked, by, more, than, 1, 200, bridges, amsterdam, has, an, oceanic, climate, k, ppen, cfb, strongly, influenced, by, its, proximity, to, the, north, sea, to, the, west, with, prevailing, westerly, winds, amsterdam, as, well, as, most, of, the, north, holland, province, lies, in, usda, hardiness, zone, 8b, frosts, mainly, occur, during, spells, of, easterly, or, northeasterly, winds, from, the, inner, european, continent, even, then, because, amsterdam, is, surrounded, on, three, sides, by, large, bodies, of, water, as, well, as, having, a, significant, heat, island, effect, nights, rarely, fall, below, 5, c, 23, f, while, it, could, easily, be, 12, c, 10, f, in, hilversum, 25, km, 16, mi, southeast, summers, are, moderately, warm, with, a, number, of, hot, and, humid, days, with, occasional, rain, every, month, the, average, daily, high, in, august, is, 22, 1, c, 72, f, and, 30, c, 86, f, or, higher, is, only, measured, on, average, on, 2, 5, days, placing, amsterdam, in, ahs, heat, zone, 2, the, record, extremes, range, from, 19, 7, c, 3, 5, f, to, 36, 3, c, 97, 3, f, days, with, more, than, 1, mm, 0, 04, in, of, precipitation, are, common, on, average, 133, days, per, year, amsterdam, s, average, annual, precipitation, is, 838, mm, 33, in, a, large, part, of, this, precipitation, falls, as, light, rain, or, brief, showers, cloudy, and, damp, days, are, common, during, the, cooler, months, of, october, through, march, in, 1300, amsterdam, s, population, was, around, 1, 000, people, while, many, towns, in, holland, experienced, population, decline, during, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, amsterdam, s, population, grew, mainly, due, to, the, rise, of, the, profitable, baltic, maritime, trade, especially, in, grain, after, the, burgundian, victory, in, the, dutch, hanseatic, war, in, 1441, the, population, of, amsterdam, was, only, modest, compared, to, the, towns, and, cities, of, flanders, and, brabant, which, comprised, the, most, urbanized, area, of, the, low, countries, this, changed, when, during, the, dutch, revolt, many, people, from, the, southern, netherlands, fled, to, the, north, especially, after, antwerp, fell, to, spanish, forces, in, 1585, jews, from, spain, portugal, and, eastern, europe, similarly, settled, in, amsterdam, as, did, germans, and, scandinavians, in, thirty, years, amsterdam, s, population, more, than, doubled, between, 1585, and, 1610, by, 1600, its, population, was, around, 50, 000, during, the, 1660s, amsterdam, s, population, reached, 200, 000, the, city, s, growth, levelled, off, and, the, population, stabilized, around, 240, 000, for, most, of, the, 18th, century, in, 1750, amsterdam, was, the, fourth, largest, city, in, western, europe, behind, london, 676, 000, paris, 560, 000, and, naples, 324, 000, this, was, all, the, more, remarkable, as, amsterdam, was, neither, the, capital, city, nor, the, seat, of, government, of, the, dutch, republic, which, itself, was, a, much, smaller, state, than, great, britain, france, or, the, ottoman, empire, in, contrast, to, those, other, metropolises, amsterdam, was, also, surrounded, by, large, towns, such, as, leiden, about, 67, 000, rotterdam, 45, 000, haarlem, 38, 000, and, utrecht, 30, 000, the, city, s, population, declined, in, the, early, 19th, century, dipping, under, 200, 000, in, 1820, by, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, industrialization, spurred, renewed, growth, amsterdam, s, population, hit, an, all, time, high, of, 872, 000, in, 1959, before, declining, in, the, following, decades, due, to, government, sponsored, suburbanisation, to, so, called, groeikernen, growth, centres, such, as, purmerend, and, almere, between, 1970, and, 1980, amsterdam, experienced, a, sharp, population, decline, peaking, at, a, net, loss, of, 25, 000, people, in, 1973, by, 1985, the, city, had, only, 675, 570, residents, this, was, soon, followed, by, reurbanization, and, gentrification, leading, to, renewed, population, growth, in, the, 2010s, also, in, the, 2010s, much, of, amsterdam, s, population, growth, was, due, to, immigration, to, the, city, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, century, non, dutch, immigrants, to, amsterdam, were, mostly, protestant, huguenots, and, flemings, sephardic, jews, and, westphalians, huguenots, came, after, the, edict, of, fontainebleau, in, 1685, while, the, flemish, protestants, came, during, the, eighty, years, war, against, catholic, spain, the, westphalians, came, to, amsterdam, mostly, for, economic, reasons, their, influx, continued, through, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, before, the, second, world, war, 10, of, the, city, population, was, jewish, just, twenty, percent, of, them, survived, the, holocaust, amsterdam, experienced, an, influx, of, religions, and, cultures, after, the, second, world, war,

origin, in, the, city, proper, is, about, 50, and, 88, of, the, population, are, dutch, citizens, the, first, mass, immigration, in, the, 20th, century, was, by, people, from, indonesia, who, came, to, amsterdam, after, the, independence, of, the, dutch, east, indies, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, in, the, 1960s, guest, workers, from, turkey, morocco, italy, and, spain, immigrated, to, amsterdam, after, the, independence, of, suriname, in, 1975, a, large, wave, of, surinamese, settled, in, amsterdam, mostly, in, the, bijlmer, area, other, immigrants, including, refugees, asylum, seekers, and, undocumented, immigrants, came, from, europe, the, americas, asia, and, africa, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, many, old, amsterdammers, moved, to, new, cities, like, almere, and, purmerend, prompted, by, the, third, land, use, planning, bill, of, the, dutch, government, this, bill, promoted, suburbanization, and, arranged, for, new, developments, in, so, called, groeikernen, literally, cores, of,

to, openly, profess, roman, catholicism, and, the, catholic, hierarchy, was, prohibited, until, the, mid, 19th, century, this, led, to, the, establishment, of, clandestine, churches, covert, religious, buildings, hidden, in, pre, existing, buildings, catholics, some, jews, and, dissenting, protestants, worshipped, in, such, buildings, a, large, influx, of, foreigners, of, many, religions,

founded, their, own, synagogues, but, had, a, strong, influence, on, the, amsterdam, dialect, adding, a, large, yiddish, local, vocabulary, despite, an, absence, of, an, official, jewish, ghetto, most, jews, preferred, to, live, in, the, eastern, part, which, used, to, be, the, centre, of, medieval, amsterdam, the, main, street, of, this, jewish, neighbourhood, was, jodenbreestraat, the, neighbourhood, comprised, the, waterlooplein, and, the, nieuwmarkt, buildings, in, this, neighbourhood, fell, into, disrepair, after, the, second, world, war, a, large, section, of, the, neighbourhood, was, demolished, during, the, construction, of, the, metro, system, this, led, to, riots, and, as, a, result, the, original, plans, for, large, scale, reconstruction, were, abandoned, by, the, government, the, neighbourhood, was, rebuilt, with, smaller, scale, residence, buildings, on, the, basis, of, its, original, layout, catholic, churches, in, amsterdam, have, been, constructed, since, the, restoration, of, the, episcopal, hierarchy, in, 1853, one, of, the, principal, architects, behind, the, city, s, catholic, churches, cuypers, was, also, responsible, for, the,

as, de, wallen, english, the, quays, it, lies, to, the, east, of, damrak, and, contains, the, city, s, famous, red, light, district, to, the, south, of, de, wallen, is, the, old, jewish, quarter, of, waterlooplein, the, medieval, and, colonial, age, canals, of, amsterdam, known, as, grachten, embraces, the, heart, of, the, city, where, homes, have, interesting, gables, beyond, the, grachtengordel, are, the, former, working, class, areas, of, jordaan, and, de, pijp, the, museumplein, with, the, city, s, major, museums, the, vondelpark, a, 19th, century, park, named, after, the, dutch, writer, joost, van, den, vondel, as, well, as, the, plantage, neighbourhood, with, the, zoo, are, also, located, outside, the, grachtengordel, several, parts, of, the, city, and, the, surrounding, urban, area, are, polders, this, can, be, recognised, by, the, suffix, meer, which, means, lake, as, in, aalsmeer, bijlmermeer, haarlemmermeer, and, watergraafsmeer, the, amsterdam, canal, system, is, the, result, of, conscious, city, planning, in, the, early, 17th, century, when, immigration, was, at, a, peak, a, comprehensive, plan, was, developed, that, was, based, on, four, concentric, half, circles, of, canals, with, their, ends, emerging, at, the, ij, bay, known, as, the, grachtengordel, three, of, the, canals, were, mostly, for, residential, development, the, herengracht, where, heren, refers, to, heren, regeerders, van, de, stad, amsterdam, ruling, lords, of, amsterdam, while, gracht, means, canal, so, that, the, name, can, be, roughly, translated, as, canal, of, the, lords, keizersgracht, emperor, s, canal, and, prinsengracht, prince, s, canal, the, fourth, and, outermost, canal, is, the, singelgracht, which, is, often, not, mentioned, on, maps, because, it, is, a, collective, name, for, all, canals, in, the, outer, ring, the, singelgracht, should, not, be, confused, with, the, oldest, and, innermost, canal, the, singel, the, canals, served, for, defense, water, management, and, transport, the, defenses, took, the, form, of, a, moat, and, earthen, dikes, with, gates, at, transit, points, but, otherwise, no, masonry, superstructures, the, original, plans, have, been, lost, so, historians, such, as, ed, taverne, need, to, speculate, on, the, original, intentions, it, is, thought, that, the, considerations, of, the, layout, were, purely, practical, and, defensive, rather, than, ornamental, construction, started, in, 1613, and, proceeded, from, west, to, east, across, the, breadth, of, the, layout, like, a, gigantic, windshield, wiper, as, the, historian, geert, mak, calls, it, and, not, from, the, centre, outwards, as, a, popular, myth, has, it, the, canal, construction, in, the, southern, sector, was, completed, by, 1656, subsequently, the, construction, of, residential, buildings, proceeded, slowly, the, eastern, part, of, the, concentric, canal, plan, covering, the, area, between, the, amstel, river, and, the, ij, bay, has, never, been, implemented, in, the, following, centuries, the, land, was, used, for, parks, senior, citizens, homes, theatres, other, public, facilities, and, waterways, without, much, planning, over, the, years, several, canals, have, been, filled, in, becoming, streets, or, squares, such, as, the, nieuwezijds, voorburgwal, and, the, spui, after, the, development, of, amsterdam, s, canals, in, the, 17th, century, the, city, did, not, grow, beyond, its, borders, for, two, centuries, during, the, 19th, century, samuel, sarphati, devised, a, plan, based, on, the, grandeur, of, paris, and, london, at, that, time, the, plan, envisaged, the, construction, of, new, houses, public, buildings, and, streets, just, outside, the, grachtengordel, the, main, aim, of, the, plan, however, was, to, improve, public, health, although, the, plan, did, not, expand, the, city, it, did, produce, some, of, the, largest, public, buildings, to, date, like, the, paleis, voor, volksvlijt, following, sarphati, civil, engineers, jacobus, van, niftrik, and, jan, kalff, designed, an, entire, ring, of, 19th, century, neighbourhoods, surrounding, the, city, s, centre, with, the, city, preserving, the, ownership, of, all, land, outside, the, 17th, century, limit, thus, firmly, controlling, development, most, of, these, neighbourhoods, became, home, to, the, working, class, in, response, to, overcrowding, two, plans, were, designed, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, which, were, very, different, from, anything, amsterdam, had, ever, seen, before, plan, zuid, designed, by, the, architect, berlage, and, west, these, plans, involved, the, development, of, new, neighbourhoods, consisting, of, housing, blocks, for, all, social, classes, after, the, second, world, war, large, new, neighbourhoods, were, built, in, the, western, southeastern, and, northern, parts, of, the, city, these, new, neighbourhoods, were, built, to, relieve, the, city, s, shortage, of, living, space, and, give, people, affordable, houses, with, modern, conveniences, the, neighbourhoods, consisted, mainly, of, large, housing, blocks, located, among, green, spaces, connected, to, wide, roads, making, the, neighbourhoods, easily, accessible, by, motor, car, the, western, suburbs, which, were, built, in, that, period, are, collectively, called, the, westelijke, tuinsteden, the, area, to, the, southeast, of, the, city, built, during, the, same, period, is, known, as, the, bijlmer, amsterdam, has, a, rich, architectural, history, the, oldest, building, in, amsterdam, is, the, oude, kerk, english, old, church, at, the, heart, of, the, wallen, consecrated, in, 1306, the, oldest, wooden, building, is, het, houten, huys, at, the, begijnhof, it, was, constructed, around, 1425, and, is, one, of, only, two, existing, wooden, buildings, it, is, also, one, of, the, few, examples, of, gothic, architecture, in, amsterdam, the, oldest, stone, building, of, the, netherlands, the, moriaan, is, built, in, s, hertogenbosch, in, the, 16th, century, wooden, buildings, were, razed, and, replaced, with, brick, ones, during, this, period, many, buildings, were, constructed, in, the, architectural, style, of, the, renaissance, buildings, of, this, period, are, very, recognisable, with, their, stepped, gable, fa, ades, which, is, the, common, dutch, renaissance, style, amsterdam, quickly, developed, its, own, renaissance, architecture, these, buildings, were, built, according, to, the, principles, of, the, architect, hendrick, de, keyser, one, of, the, most, striking, buildings, designed, by, hendrick, de, keyser, is, the, westerkerk, in, the, 17th, century, baroque, architecture, became, very, popular, as, it, was, elsewhere, in, europe, this, roughly, coincided, with, amsterdam, s, golden, age, the, leading, architects, of, this, style, in, amsterdam, were, jacob, van, campen, philips, vingboons, and, daniel, stalpaert, philip, vingboons, designed, splendid, merchants, houses, throughout, the, city, a, famous, building, in, baroque, style, in, amsterdam, is, the, royal, palace, on, dam, square, throughout, the, 18th, century, amsterdam, was, heavily, influenced, by, french, culture, this, is, reflected, in, the, architecture, of, that, period, around, 1815, architects, broke, with, the, baroque, style, and, started, building, in, different, neo, styles, most, gothic, style, buildings, date, from, that, era, and, are, therefore, said, to, be, built, in, a, neo, gothic, style, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, jugendstil, or, art, nouveau, style, became, popular, and, many, new, buildings, were, constructed, in, this, architectural, style, since, amsterdam, expanded, rapidly, during, this, period, new, buildings, adjacent, to, the, city, centre, were, also, built, in, this, style, the, houses, in, the, vicinity, of, the, museum, square, in, amsterdam, oud, zuid, are, an, example, of, jugendstil, the, last, style, that, was, popular, in, amsterdam, before, the, modern, era, was, art, deco, amsterdam, had, its, own, version, of, the, style, which, was, called, the, amsterdamse, school, whole, districts, were, built, in, this, style, such, as, the, rivierenbuurt, a, notable, feature, of, the, fa, ades, of, buildings, designed, in, amsterdamse, school, is, that, they, are, highly, decorated, and, ornate, with, oddly, shaped, windows, and, doors, the, old, city, centre, is, the, focal, point, of, all, the, architectural, styles, before, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, jugendstil, and, georgian, are, mostly, found, outside, the, city, centre, in, the, neighbourhoods, built, in, the, early, 20th, century, although, there, are, also, some, striking, examples, of, these, styles, in, the, city, centre, most, historic, buildings, in,
