of, bhutan, s, minority, population, groups, of, nepali, speakers, lhotshampa, in, southern, bhutan, fell, victim, to, perceived, political, persecution, by, the, bhutanese, government, as, part, of, what, the, nepali, speaking, population, viewed, as, bhutanisation, termed, one, nation, one, people, policy, which, was, aimed, to, nationalise, the, country, in, 1977, followed, by, in, 1985, bhutan, s, government, enacted, legislations, which, impacted, the, lhotshampa, ethnic, minority, the, review, of, the, national, citizenship, criteria, and, provisions, for, denationalisation, of,

was, aligned, with, the, majority, drukpa, culture, of, the, country, the, lhotshampas, started, demonstrations, in, protest, of, such, discriminatory, laws, voicing, for, a, change, to, be, brought, to, the, existing, political, system, toward, a, preferred, multi, party, democracy, and, to, gain, political, autonomy, for, the, nepali, ethnic, minority, most, probably, incited, by, the, similar, political, uprising, against, the, established, monarchy, in, the, neighbouring, country, of, nepal, these, demonstrations, turned, into, violence, when, some, ethnic, nepalese, representatives, were, attacked, by, the, government, officials, armed, forces, when, schools, in, the, southern, districts, were, burned, by, the, demonstrators, consequently, bhutanese, armed, forces, were, mobilised, the, members, of, bhutanese, police, and, army, forces, allegedly, imprisoned, some, nepali, descendant, ethnic, minority, who, were, suspected, to, be, politically, active, in, these, demonstrations, under, a, command, of, then, king, jigme, singye, wangchuck, and, home, minister, dago, tshering, to, keep, peace, and, open, a, line, of, communication, bhutan, armed, forces, were, alleged, to,

confiscated, where, no, compensation, were, reported, to, be, granted, to, anyone, however, claims, to, these, were, neither, proved, nor, documented, this, escalated, up, until, the, early, 1990s, and, was, followed, by, the, forceful, expulsion, of, nepali, ethnic, minority, citizens, from, the, southern, part, of, bhutan, the, main, purpose, of, this, was, the, fear, that, revolt, mirrored, images, of, the, gorkhaland, movement, stirring, up, in, the, neighbouring, state, of, west, bengal, and, fueled, fears, of, a, fate, similar, to, the, kingdom, of, sikkim, where, the, immigrant, nepalis, population, had, overwhelmed, the, small, native, population, of, the, kingdom, leading, to, its, demise, as, an, independent, nation, the, bhutanese, security, forces, were, accused, of, human, rights, violations, including, torture, and, rape, of, political, demonstrators, and, some, lhotshampas, were, accused, of, staging, a, violent, revolt, against, the, state, according, to, the, unhcr, an, estimate, of, 107, 000, bhutanese, refugees, living, in, seven, camps, in, eastern, nepal, have, been, documented, as, of, 2008, after, many, years, in, refugee, camps, many, inhabitants,

government, refused, to, assimilate, the, bhutanese, refugees, lhotshampas, and, did, not, allow, a, legal, path, to, citizenship, so, they, were, left, stateless, careful, scrutiny, has, been, used, to, review, the, status, of, the, refugee, s, relatives, in, the, country, and, citizenship, identity, cards, and, voting, rights, for, these, reviewed, people, are, restricted, bhutan, does, not, recognise, political, parties, associated, with, these, refugees, and, see, them, as, a, threat, to, the, well, being, of, the, country, human, rights, groups, rhetoric, that, the, government, interfered, with, individual, rights, by, requiring, all, citizens, including, ethnic, minority, members, to, wear, the, traditional, dress, of, the, ethnic, majority, in, public, places, was, used, as, a, political, tool, for, the, demonstrations, the, bhutanese, government, since, then, enforced, the, law, of, national, attire, to, be, worn, in, buddhist, religious, buildings, government, offices, schools, official, functions, and, public, ceremonies, aimed, toward, preserving, and, promoting, the, national, identity, of, bhutan, the, kingdom, has, been, accused, of, banning, religious, proselytising, which, critics, deem, as, a, violation, of, freedom, of, religion, and, a, policy, of, ethnic, cleansing, starting, in, the, 1980s, bhutan, adopted, a, policy, of, one, nation, one, people, to, create, a, unified, sense, of, national, identity, this, was, interpreted, as, cultural, in, language, dress, and, religion, and, political, dominance, of, the, majority, drukpa, people, by, the, nepali, speaking, people, inspired, by, the, gorkhaland, movement, and, fuelled, by, a, sense, of, injustice, some, lhotshampas, began, organising, demonstrations, against, the, bhutanese, state, furthermore, the, removal, of, nepali, language, in, school, curriculum, to, adopt, a, more, centralised, language, in, dzongkha, coupled, with, the, denial, of, citizenship, to, those, who, were, not, able, to, prove, officially, issued, land, holding, title, prior, to, 1950, was, perceived, as, specifically, targeting, lhotshampa, population, estimated, to, be, one, third, of, the, population, at, the, time, this, resulted, in, widespread, unrest, and, political, demonstrations, in, response, to, this, threat, in, 1988, the, bhutanese, authorities, carried, out, a, special, census, in, southern, bhutan, to, review, the, status, of, legal, residents, from, illegal, immigrants, this, region, with, high, lhotshampa, population, had, to, be, legally, verified, and, the, following, census, led, to, the, deportation, these, lhotshampas, estimated, to, be, one, sixth, of, the, total, population, at, the, time, people, who, had, been, granted, citizenship, by, the, bhutanese, 1958, nationality, law, were, also, stripped, of, their, citizenship, the, state, intervened, after, violence, was, instigated, by, some, nepali, speaking, citizens, in, radical, form, of, attacking, government, officials, and, burning, of, schools, members, of, bhutanese, police, and, army, were, accused, of, burning, lhotshampa, houses, land, confiscation, and, other, widespread,
