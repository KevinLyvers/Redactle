thousands, of, years, and, it, is, widely, believed, that, the, region, served, as, the, entry, point, for, the, initial, settlement, of, north, america, by, way, of, the, bering, land, bridge, the, russian, empire, was, the, first, to, actively, colonize, the, area, beginning, in, the, 18th, century, eventually, establishing, russian, america, which, spanned, most, of, the, current, state, and, promoted, and, maintained, a, native, alaskan, creole, population, the, expense, and, logistical, difficulty, of, maintaining, this, distant, possession, prompted, its, sale, to, the, u, s, in, 1867, for, us, 7, 2, million, equivalent, to, 157, million, in, 2023, the, area, went, through, several, administrative, changes, before, becoming, organized, as, a, territory, on, may, 11, 1912, it, was, admitted, as, the, 49th, state, of, the, u, s, on, january, 3, 1959, abundant, natural, resources, have, enabled, alaska, with, one, of, the, smallest, state, economies, to, have, one, of, the, highest, per, capita, incomes, with, commercial, fishing, and, the, extraction, of, natural, gas, and, oil, dominating, alaska, s, economy, u, s, armed, forces, bases, and, tourism, also, contribute, to, the, economy, more, than, half, of, the, state, is, federally, owned, land, containing, national, forests, national, parks, and, wildlife, refuges, it, is, among, the, most, irreligious, states, one, of, the, first, to, legalize, recreational, marijuana, and, is, known, for, its, libertarian, leaning, political, culture, generally, supporting, the, republican, party, in, national, elections, the, indigenous, population, of, alaska, is, proportionally, the, second, highest, of, any, u, s, state, at, over, 15, percent, after, only, hawaii, the, name, alaska, russian, romanized, alj, ska, was, introduced, in, the, russian, colonial, period, when, it, was, used, to, refer, to, the, alaska, peninsula, it, was, derived, from, an, aleut, language, idiom, alaxsxaq, meaning, the, mainland, or, more, literally, the, object, towards, which, the, action, of, the, sea, is, directed, numerous, indigenous, peoples, occupied, alaska, for, thousands, of, years, before, the, arrival, of, european, peoples, to, the, area, linguistic, and, dna, studies, done, here, have, provided, evidence, for, the, settlement, of, north, america, by, way, of, the, bering, land, bridge, at, the,

fatalities, and, social, disruption, some, researchers, believe, the, first, russian, settlement, in, alaska, was, established, in, the, 17th, century, according, to, this, hypothesis, in, 1648, several, koches, of, semyon, dezhnyov, s, expedition, came, ashore, in, alaska, by, storm, and, founded, this, settlement, this, hypothesis, is, based, on, the, testimony, of, chukchi, geographer, nikolai, daurkin, who, had, visited, alaska, in, 1764, 1765, and, who, had, reported, on, a, village, on, the, kheuveren, river, populated, by, bearded, men, who, pray, to, the, icons, some, modern, researchers, associate, kheuveren, with, koyuk, river, the, first, european, vessel, to, reach, alaska, is, generally, held, to, be, the, st, gabriel, under, the, authority, of, the, surveyor, m, s,

natural, gas, is, seafood, primarily, salmon, cod, pollock, and, crab, agriculture, represents, a, very, small, fraction, of, the, alaskan, economy, agricultural, production, is, primarily, for, consumption, within, the, state, and, includes, nursery, stock, dairy, products, vegetables, and, livestock, manufacturing, is, limited, with, most, foodstuffs, and, general, goods, imported, from, elsewhere, employment, is, primarily, in, government, and, industries, such, as, natural, resource, extraction, shipping, and, transportation, military, bases, are, a, significant, component, of, the, economy, in, the, fairbanks, north, star, anchorage, and, kodiak, island, boroughs, as, well, as, kodiak, federal, subsidies, are, also, an, important, part, of, the, economy, allowing, the, state, to, keep, taxes, low, its, industrial, outputs, are, crude, petroleum, natural, gas, coal, gold, precious, metals, zinc, and, other, mining, seafood, processing, timber, and, wood, products, there, is, also, a, growing, service, and, tourism, sector, tourists, have, contributed, to, the, economy, by, supporting, local, lodging, alaska, has, vast, energy, resources, although, its, oil, reserves, have, been, largely, depleted, major, oil, and, gas, reserves, were, found, in, the, alaska, north, slope, ans, and, cook, inlet, basins, but, according, to, the, energy, information, administration, by, february, 2014, alaska, had, fallen, to, fourth, place, in, the, nation, in, crude, oil, production, after, texas, north, dakota, and, california, prudhoe, bay, on, alaska, s, north, slope, is, still, the, second, highest, yielding, oil, field, in, the, united, states, typically, producing, about, 400, 000, barrels, per, day, 64, 000, m, 3, d, although, by, early, 2014, north, dakota, s, bakken, formation, was, producing, over, 900, 000, barrels, per, day, 140, 000, m, 3, d, prudhoe, bay, was, the, largest, conventional, oil, field, ever, discovered, in, north, america, but, was, much, smaller, than, canada, s, enormous, athabasca, oil, sands, field, which, by, 2014, was, producing, about, 1, 500, 000, barrels, per, day, 240, 000, m, 3, d, of, unconventional, oil, and, had, hundreds, of, years, of, producible, reserves, at, that, rate, the, trans, alaska, pipeline, can, transport, and, pump, up, to, 2, 1, million, barrels, 330, 000, m, 3, of, crude, oil, per, day, more, than, any, other, crude, oil, pipeline, in, the, united, states, additionally, substantial, coal, deposits, are, found, in, alaska, s, bituminous, sub, bituminous, and, lignite, coal, basins, the, united, states, geological, survey, estimates, that, there, are, 85, 4, trillion, cubic, feet, 2, 420, km, 3, of, undiscovered, technically, recoverable, gas, from, natural, gas, hydrates, on, the, alaskan, north, slope, alaska, also, offers, some, of, the, highest, hydroelectric, power, potential, in, the, country, from, its, numerous, rivers, large, swaths, of, the, alaskan, coastline, offer, wind, and, geothermal, energy, potential, as, well, alaska, s, economy, depends, heavily, on, increasingly, expensive, diesel, fuel, for, heating, transportation, electric, power, and, light, although, wind, and, hydroelectric, power, are, abundant, and, underdeveloped, proposals, for, statewide, energy, systems, were, judged, uneconomical, at, the, time, of, the, report, 2001, due, to, low, less, than, 50, gal, fuel, prices, long, distances, and, low, population, the, cost, of, a, gallon, of, gas, in, urban, alaska, is, usually, thirty, to, sixty, cents, higher, than, the, national, average, prices, in, rural, areas, are, generally, significantly, higher, but, vary, widely, depending, on, transportation, costs, seasonal, usage, peaks, nearby, petroleum, development, infrastructure, and, many, other, factors, the, alaska, permanent, fund, is, a, constitutionally, authorized, appropriation, of, oil, revenues, established, by, voters, in, 1976, to, manage, a, surplus, in, state, petroleum, revenues, from, oil, largely, in, anticipation, of, the, then, recently, constructed, trans, alaska, pipeline, system, the, fund, was, originally, proposed, by, governor, keith, miller, on, the, eve, of, the, 1969, prudhoe, bay, lease, sale, out, of, fear, that, the, legislature, would, spend, the, entire, proceeds, of, the, sale, which, amounted, to, 900, million, at, once, it, was, later, championed, by, governor, jay, hammond, and, kenai, state, representative, hugh, malone, it, has, served, as, an, attractive, political, prospect, ever, since, diverting, revenues, which, would, normally, be, deposited, into, the, general, fund, the, alaska, constitution, was, written, so, as, to, discourage, dedicating, state, funds, for, a, particular, purpose, the, permanent, fund, has, become, the, rare, exception, to, this, mostly, due, to, the, political, climate, of, distrust, existing, during, the, time, of, its, creation, from, its, initial, principal, of, 734, 000, the, fund, has, grown, to, 50, billion, as, a, result, of, oil, royalties, and, capital, investment, programs, most, if, not, all, the, principal, is, invested, conservatively, outside, alaska, this, has, led, to, frequent, calls, by, alaskan, politicians, for, the, fund, to, make, investments, within, alaska, though, such, a, stance, has, never, gained, momentum, starting, in, 1982, dividends, from, the, fund, s, annual, growth, have, been, paid, out, each, year, to, eligible, alaskans, ranging, from, an, initial, 1, 000, in, 1982, equal, to, three, years, payout, as, the, distribution, of, payments, was, held, up, in, a, lawsuit, over, the, distribution, scheme, to, 3, 269, in, 2008, which, included, a, one, time, 1, 200, resource, rebate, every, year, the, state, legislature, takes, out, 8, from, the, earnings, puts, 3, back, into, the, principal, for, inflation, proofing, and, the, remaining, 5, is, distributed, to, all, qualifying, alaskans, to, qualify, for, the, permanent, fund, dividend, one, must, have, lived, in, the, state, for, a, minimum, of, 12, months, maintain, constant, residency, subject, to, allowable, absences, and, not, be, subject, to, court, judgments, or, criminal, convictions, which, fall, under, various, disqualifying, classifications, or, may, subject, the, payment, amount, to, civil, garnishment, the, permanent, fund, is, often, considered, to, be, one, of, the, leading, examples, of, a, basic, income, policy, in, the, world, the, cost, of, goods, in, alaska, has, long, been, higher, than, in, the, contiguous, 48, states, federal, government, employees, particularly, united, states, postal, service, usps, workers, and, active, duty, military, members, receive, a, cost, of, living, allowance, usually, set, at, 25, of, base, pay, because, while, the, cost, of, living, has, gone, down, it, is, still, one, of, the, highest, in, the, country, rural, alaska, suffers, from, extremely, high, prices, for, food, and, consumer, goods, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, country, due, to, the, relatively, limited, transportation, infrastructure, due, to, the, northern, climate, and, short, growing, season, relatively, little, farming, occurs, in, alaska, most, farms, are, in, either, the, matanuska, valley, about, 40, miles, 64, km, northeast, of, anchorage, or, on, the, kenai, peninsula, about, 60, miles, 97, km, southwest, of, anchorage, the, short, 100, day, growing, season, limits, the, crops, that, can, be, grown, but, the, long, sunny, summer, days, make, for, productive, growing, seasons, the, primary, crops, are, potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and, cabbage, the, tanana, valley, is, another, notable, agricultural, locus, especially, the, delta, junction, area, about, 100, miles, 160, km, southeast, of, fairbanks, with, a, sizable, concentration, of, farms, growing, agronomic, crops, these, farms, mostly, lie, north, and, east, of, fort, greely, this, area, was, largely, set, aside, and, developed, under, a, state, program, spearheaded, by, hammond, during, his, second, term, as, governor, delta, area, crops, consist, predominantly, of, barley, and, hay, west, of, fairbanks, lies, another, concentration, of, small, farms, catering, to, restaurants, the, hotel, and, tourist, industry, and, community, supported, agriculture, alaskan, agriculture, has, experienced, a, surge, in, growth, of, market, gardeners, small, farms, and, farmers, markets, in, recent, years, with, the, highest, percentage, increase, 46, in, the, nation, in, growth, in, farmers, markets, in, 2011, compared, to, 17, nationwide, the, peony, industry, has, also, taken, off, as, the, growing, season, allows, farmers, to, harvest, during, a, gap, in, supply, elsewhere, in, the, world, thereby, filling, a, niche, in, the, flower, market, alaska, with, no, counties, lacks, county, fairs, instead, a, small, assortment, of, state, and, local, fairs, with, the, alaska, state, fair, in, palmer, the, largest, are, held, mostly, in, the, late, summer, the, fairs, are, mostly, located, in, communities, with, historic, or, current, agricultural, activity, and, feature, local, farmers, exhibiting, produce, in, addition, to, more, high, profile, commercial, activities, such, as, carnival, rides, concerts, and, food, alaska, grown, is, used, as, an, agricultural, slogan, alaska, has, an, abundance, of, seafood, with, the, primary, fisheries, in, the, bering, sea, and, the, north, pacific, seafood, is, one, of, the, few, food, items, that, is, often, cheaper, within, the, state, than, outside, it, many, alaskans, take, advantage, of, salmon, seasons, to, harvest, portions, of, their, household, diet, while, fishing, for, subsistence, as, well, as, sport, this, includes, fish, taken, by, hook, net, or, wheel, hunting, for, subsistence, primarily, caribou, moose, and, dall, sheep, is, still, common, in, the, state, particularly, in, remote, bush, communities, an, example, of, a, traditional, native, food, is, akutaq, the, eskimo, ice, cream, which, can, consist, of, reindeer, fat, seal, oil, dried, fish, meat, and, local, berries, alaska, s, reindeer, herding, is, concentrated, on, seward, peninsula, where, wild, caribou, can, be, prevented, from, mingling, and, migrating, with, the, domesticated, reindeer, most, food, in, alaska, is, transported, into, the, state, from, outside, the, other, 49, u, s, states, and, shipping, costs, make, food, in, the, cities, relatively, expensive, in, rural, areas, subsistence, hunting, and, gathering, is, an, essential, activity, because, imported, food, is, prohibitively, expensive, although, most, small, towns, and, villages, in, alaska, lie, along, the, coastline, the, cost, of, importing, food, to, remote, villages, can, be, high, because, of, the, terrain, and, difficult, road, conditions, which, change, dramatically, due, to, varying, climate, and, precipitation, changes, transport, costs, can, reach, 50, per, pound, 1, 10, kg, or, higher, in, some, remote, areas, during, times, of, inclement, weather, or, rough, terrain, conditions, if, these, locations, can, be, reached, at, all, the, cost, of, delivering, a, gallon, 3, 8, l, of, milk, is, about, 3, 50, in, many, villages, where, per, capita, income, can, be, 20, 000, or, less, fuel, cost, per, gallon, is, routinely, twenty, to, thirty, cents, higher, than, the, contiguous, united, states, average, with, only, hawaii, having, higher, prices, some, of, alaska, s, popular, annual, events, are, the,

memorial, tunnel, an, active, alaska, railroad, tunnel, recently, upgraded, to, provide, a, paved, roadway, link, with, the, isolated, community, of, whittier, on, prince, william, sound, to, the, seward, highway, about, 50, miles, 80, km, southeast, of, anchorage, at, portage, at, 2, 5, miles, 4, 0, km, the, tunnel, was, the, longest, road, tunnel, in, north, america, until, 2007, the, tunnel, is, the, longest, combination, road, and, rail, tunnel, in, north, america, southwest, alaska, is, largely, coastal, sparsely, populated, and, unconnected, to, the, road, system, access, to, most, communities, in, southwest, alaska, is, primarily, by, air, taxi, although, larger, towns, like, kodiak, bethel, king, salmon, dillingham, and, dutch, harbor, are, accessible, by, scheduled, air, service, additionally, some, coastal, communities, can, be, reached, via, the, alaska, marine, highway, ferry, built, around, 1915, the, alaska, railroad, arr, played, a, key, role, in, the, development, of, alaska, through, the, 20th, century, it, links, shipping, lanes, on, the, north, pacific, with, interior, alaska, with, tracks, that, run, from, seward, by, way, of, south, central, alaska, passing, through, anchorage, eklutna, wasilla, talkeetna, denali, and, fairbanks, with, spurs, to, whittier, palmer, and, north, pole, the, cities, towns, villages, and, region, served, by, arr, tracks, are, known, statewide, as, the, railbelt, in, recent, years, the, ever, improving, paved, highway, system, began, to, eclipse, the, railroad, s, importance, in, alaska, s, economy, the, railroad, played, a, vital, role, in, alaska, s, development, moving, freight, into, alaska, while, transporting, natural, resources, southward, such, as, coal, from, the, usibelli, coal, mine, near, healy, to, seward, and, gravel, from, the, matanuska, valley, to, anchorage, it, is, well, known, for, its, summertime, tour, passenger, service, the, alaska, railroad, was, one, of, the, last, railroads, in, north, america, to, use, cabooses, in, regular, service, and, still, uses, them, on, some, gravel, trains, it, continues, to, offer, one, of, the, last, flag, stop, routes, in, the, country, a, stretch, of, about, 60, miles, 100, km, of, track, along, an, area, north, of, talkeetna, remains, inaccessible, by, road, the, railroad, provides, the, only, transportation, to, rural, homes, and, cabins, in, the, area, until, construction, of, the, parks, highway, in, the, 1970s, the, railroad, provided, the, only, land, access, to, most, of, the, region, along, its, entire, route, in, northern, southeast, alaska, the, white, pass, and, yukon, route, also, partly, runs, through, the, state, from, skagway, northwards, into, canada, british, columbia, and, yukon, territory,

southeast, the, gulf, coast, and, the, alaska, peninsula, the, ferries, transport, vehicles, as, well, as, passengers, the, system, also, operates, a, ferry, service, from, bellingham, washington, and, prince, rupert, british, columbia, in, canada, through, the, inside, passage, to, skagway, the, inter, island, ferry, authority, also, serves, as, an, important, marine, link, for, many, communities, in, the, prince, of, wales, island, region, of, southeast, and, works, in, concert, with, the, alaska, marine, highway, in, recent, years, cruise, lines, have, created, a, summertime, tourism, market, mainly, connecting, the, pacific, northwest, to, southeast, alaska, and, to, a, lesser, degree, towns, along, alaska, s, gulf, coast, the, population, of, ketchikan, for, example, fluctuates, dramatically, on, many, days, up, to, four, large, cruise, ships, can, dock, there, at, the, same, time, cities, not, served, by, road, sea, or, river, can, be, reached, only, by, air,
