the, fortifications, were, scattered, and, the, outer, fence, was, weak, when, the, enemy, attacked, the, entire, garrison, would, have, to, defend, the, fortress, with, objects, separate, from, each, other, this, actually, happened, in, 1716, during, the, defense, of, the, yamyshevskaya, fortress, the, unsuccessful, layout, of, the, first, yamyshev, and, omsk, fortresses, was, explained, by, the,

and, courtyards, in, a, line, in, 1722, this, drawing, was, used, by, the, captain, engineer, paul, de, grange, in, the, plan, s, development, of, the, fortress, on, the, right, bank, of, the, om, at, the, end, of, the, summer, of, 1717, gagarin, ordered, the, production, of, six, bells, for, the, yamyshevskaya, and, omsk, fortresses, bells, were, made, by, the, military, department, in, the,

at, the, crossing, over, the, om, and, a, pentagonal, fortress, in, the, yard, at, the, beginning, of, 1718, seven, bells, were, made, perhaps, the, seventh, was, intended, for, the, omsk, sloboda, on, the, right, bank, of, the, om, there, is, no, information, about, whether, the, quadrangular, fort, and, the, triangular, redoubt, were, built, however, it, is, known, that, the, fortress, defensive, structure, was, built, pentagonal, although, not, as, regular, as, in, the, drawing, this, is, clear, from, the, plans, of, 1745, and, 1755, the, entire, settlement, omsk, fortress, including, the, cossack, settlement, and, the, main, defensive, structure, had, the, shape, of, an, irregular, broken, quadrangle, in, 1768, om, fortress, was, moved, the, original, tobolsk, and, the,
