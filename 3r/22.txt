in, geography, latitude, is, a, coordinate, that, specifies, the, north, south, position, of, a, point, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, or, another, celestial, body, latitude, is, given, as, an, angle, that, ranges, from, 90, at, the, south, pole, to, 90, at, the, north, pole, with, 0, at, the, equator, lines, of, constant, latitude, or, parallels, run, east, west, as, circles, parallel, to, the, equator, latitude, and, longitude, are, used, together, as, a, coordinate, pair, to, specify, a, location, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, on, its, own, the, term, latitude, normally, refers, to, the, geodetic, latitude, as, defined, below, briefly, the, geodetic, latitude, of, a, point, is, the, angle, formed, between, the, vector, perpendicular, or, normal, to, the, ellipsoidal, surface, from, the, point, and, the, plane, of, the, equator, two, levels, of, abstraction, are, employed, in, the, definitions, of, latitude, and, longitude, in, the, first, step, the, physical, surface, is, modeled, by, the, geoid, a, surface, which, approximates, the, mean, sea, level, over, the, oceans, and, its, continuation, under, the, land, masses, the, second, step, is, to, approximate, the, geoid, by, a, mathematically, simpler, reference, surface, the, simplest, choice, for, the, reference, surface, is, a, sphere, but, the, geoid, is, more, accurately, modeled, by, an, ellipsoid, of, revolution, the, definitions, of, latitude, and, longitude, on, such, reference, surfaces, are, detailed, in, the, following, sections, lines, of, constant, latitude, and, longitude, together, constitute, a, graticule, on, the, reference, surface, the, latitude, of, a, point, on, the, actual, surface, is, that, of, the, corresponding, point, on, the, reference, surface, the, correspondence, being, along, the, normal, to, the, reference, surface, which, passes, through, the, point, on, the, physical, surface, latitude, and, longitude, together, with, some, specification, of, height, constitute, a, geographic, coordinate, system, as, defined, in, the, specification, of, the, iso, 19111, standard, since, there, are, many, different, reference, ellipsoids, the, precise, latitude, of, a, feature, on, the, surface, is, not, unique, this, is, stressed, in, the, iso, standard, which, states, that, without, the, full, specification, of, the, coordinate, reference, system, coordinates, that, is, latitude, and, longitude, are, ambiguous, at, best, and, meaningless, at, worst, this, is, of, great, importance, in, accurate, applications, such, as, a, global, positioning, system, gps, but, in, common, usage, where, high, accuracy, is, not, required, the, reference, ellipsoid, is, not, usually, stated, in, english, texts, the, latitude, angle, defined, below, is, usually, denoted, by, the, greek, lower, case, letter, phi, or, it, is, measured, in, degrees, minutes, and, seconds, or, decimal, degrees, north, or, south, of, the, equator, for, navigational, purposes, positions, are, given, in, degrees, and, decimal, minutes, for, instance, the, needles, lighthouse, is, at, 50, 39, 734, n, 001, 35, 500, w, this, article, relates, to, coordinate, systems, for, the, earth, it, may, be, adapted, to, cover, the, moon, planets, and, other, celestial, objects, planetographic, latitude, for, a, brief, history, see, history, of, latitude, in, celestial, navigation, latitude, is, determined, with, the, meridian, altitude, method, more, precise, measurement, of, latitude, requires, an, understanding, of, the, gravitational, field, of, the, earth, either, to, set, up, theodolites, or, to, determine, gps, satellite, orbits, the, study, of, the, figure, of, the, earth, together, with, its, gravitational, field, is, the, science, of, geodesy, the, graticule, is, formed, by, the, lines, of, constant, latitude, and, constant, longitude, which, are, constructed, with, reference, to, the, rotation, axis, of, the, earth, the, primary, reference, points, are, the, poles, where, the, axis, of, rotation, of, the, earth, intersects, the, reference, surface, planes, which, contain, the, rotation, axis, intersect, the, surface, at, the, meridians, and, the, angle, between, any, one, meridian, plane, and, that, through, greenwich, the, prime, meridian, defines, the, longitude, meridians, are, lines, of, constant, longitude, the, plane, through, the, centre, of, the, earth, and, perpendicular, to, the, rotation, axis, intersects, the, surface, at, a, great, circle, called, the, equator, planes, parallel, to, the, equatorial, plane, intersect, the, surface, in, circles, of, constant, latitude, these, are, the, parallels, the, equator, has, a, latitude, of, 0, the, north, pole, has, a, latitude, of, 90, north, written, 90, n, or, 90, and, the, south, pole, has, a, latitude, of, 90, south, written, 90, s, or, 90, the, latitude, of, an, arbitrary, point, is, the, angle, between, the, equatorial, plane, and, the, normal, to, the, surface, at, that, point, the, normal, to, the, surface, of, the, sphere, is, along, the, radial, vector, the, latitude, as, defined, in, this, way, for, the, sphere, is, often, termed, the, spherical, latitude, to, avoid, ambiguity, with, the, geodetic, latitude, and, the, auxiliary, latitudes, defined, in, subsequent, sections, of, this, article, besides, the, equator, four, other, parallels, are, of, significance, the, plane, of, the, earth, s, orbit, about, the, sun, is, called, the, ecliptic, and, the, plane, perpendicular, to, the, rotation, axis, of, the, earth, is, the, equatorial, plane, the, angle, between, the, ecliptic, and, the, equatorial, plane, is, called, variously, the, axial, tilt, the, obliquity, or, the, inclination, of, the, ecliptic, and, it, is, conventionally, denoted, by, i, the, latitude, of, the, tropical, circles, is, equal, to, i, and, the, latitude, of, the, polar, circles, is, its, complement, 90, i, the, axis, of, rotation, varies, slowly, over, time, and, the, values, given, here, are, those, for, the, current, epoch, the, time, variation, is, discussed, more, fully, in, the, article, on, axial, tilt, the, figure, shows, the, geometry, of, a, cross, section, of, the, plane, perpendicular, to, the, ecliptic, and, through, the, centres, of, the, earth, and, the, sun, at, the, december, solstice, when, the, sun, is, overhead, at, some, point, of, the, tropic, of, capricorn, the, south, polar, latitudes, below, the, antarctic, circle, are, in, daylight, whilst, the, north, polar, latitudes, above, the, arctic, circle, are, in, night, the, situation, is, reversed, at, the, june, solstice, when, the, sun, is, overhead, at, the, tropic, of, cancer, only, at, latitudes, in, between, the, two, tropics, is, it, possible, for, the, sun, to, be, directly, overhead, at, the, zenith, on, map, projections, there, is, no, universal, rule, as, to, how, meridians, and, parallels, should, appear, the, examples, below, show, the, named, parallels, as, red, lines, on, the, commonly, used, mercator, projection, and, the, transverse, mercator, projection, on, the, former, the, parallels, are, horizontal, and, the, meridians, are, vertical, whereas, on, the, latter, there, is, no, exact, relationship, of, parallels, and, meridians, with, horizontal, and, vertical, both, are, complicated, curves, in, 1687, isaac, newton, published, the, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, in, which, he, proved, that, a, rotating, self, gravitating, fluid, body, in, equilibrium, takes, the, form, of, an, oblate, ellipsoid, this, article, uses, the, term, ellipsoid, in, preference, to, the, older, term, spheroid, newton, s, result, was, confirmed, by, geodetic, measurements, in, the, 18th, century, see, meridian, arc, an, oblate, ellipsoid, is, the, three, dimensional, surface, generated, by, the, rotation, of, an, ellipse, about, its, shorter, axis, minor, axis, oblate, ellipsoid, of, revolution, is, abbreviated, to, ellipsoid, in, the, remainder, of, this, article, ellipsoids, which, do, not, have, an, axis, of, symmetry, are, termed, triaxial, many, different, reference, ellipsoids, have, been, used, in, the, history, of, geodesy, in, pre, satellite, days, they, were, devised, to, give, a, good, fit, to, the, geoid, over, the, limited, area, of, a, survey, but, with, the, advent, of, gps, it, has, become, natural, to, use, reference, ellipsoids, such, as, wgs84, with, centre, at, the, centre, of, mass, of, the, earth, and, minor, axis, aligned, to, the, rotation, axis, of, the, earth, these, geocentric, ellipsoids, are, usually, within, 100, m, 330, ft, of, the, geoid, since, latitude, is, defined, with, respect, to, an, ellipsoid, the, position, of, a, given, point, is, different, on, each, ellipsoid, one, cannot, exactly, specify, the, latitude, and, longitude, of, a, geographical, feature, without, specifying, the, ellipsoid, used, many, maps, maintained, by, national, agencies, are, based, on, older, ellipsoids, so, one, must, know, how, the, latitude, and, longitude, values, are, transformed, from, one, ellipsoid, to, another, gps, handsets, include, software, to, carry, out, datum, transformations, which, link, wgs84, to, the, local, reference, ellipsoid, with, its, associated, grid, the, shape, of, an, ellipsoid, of, revolution, is, determined, by, the, shape, of, the, ellipse, which, is, rotated, about, its, minor, shorter, axis, two, parameters, are, required, one, is, invariably, the, equatorial, radius, which, is, the, semi, major, axis, a, the, other, parameter, is, usually, 1, the, polar, radius, or, semi, minor, axis, b, or, 2, the, first, flattening, f, or, 3, the, eccentricity, e, these, parameters, are, not, independent, they, are, related, by, many, other, parameters, see, ellipse, ellipsoid, appear, in, the, study, of, geodesy, geophysics, and, map, projections, but, they, can, all, be, expressed, in, terms, of, one, or, two, members, of, the, set, a, b, f, and, e, both, f, and, e, are, small, and, often, appear, in, series, expansions, in, calculations, they, are, of, the, order, 1, 298, and, 0, 0818, respectively, values, for, a, number, of, ellipsoids, are, given, in, figure, of, the, earth, reference, ellipsoids, are, usually, defined, by, the, semi, major, axis, and, the, inverse, flattening, 1, f, for, example, the, defining, values, for, the, wgs84, ellipsoid, used, by, all, gps, devices, are, from, which, are, derived, the, difference, between, the, semi, major, and, semi, minor, axes, is, about, 21, km, 13, miles, and, as, fraction, of, the, semi, major, axis, it, equals, the, flattening, on, a, computer, monitor, the, ellipsoid, could, be, sized, as, 300, by, 299, pixels, this, would, barely, be, distinguishable, from, a, 300, by, 300, pixel, sphere, so, illustrations, usually, exaggerate, the, flattening, the, graticule, on, the, ellipsoid, is, constructed, in, exactly, the, same, way, as, on, the, sphere, the, normal, at, a, point, on, the, surface, of, an, ellipsoid, does, not, pass, through, the, centre, except, for, points, on, the, equator, or, at, the, poles, but, the, definition, of, latitude, remains, unchanged, as, the, angle, between, the, normal, and, the, equatorial, plane, the, terminology, for, latitude, must, be, made, more, precise, by, distinguishing, geographic, latitude, must, be, used, with, care, as, some, authors, use, it, as, a, synonym, for, geodetic, latitude, whilst, others, use, it, as, an, alternative, to, the, astronomical, latitude, latitude, unqualified, should, normally, refer, to, the, geodetic, latitude, the, importance, of, specifying, the, reference, datum, may, be, illustrated, by, a, simple, example, on, the, reference, ellipsoid, for, wgs84, the, centre, of, the, eiffel, tower, has, a, geodetic, latitude, of, 48, 51, 29, n, or, 48, 8583, n, and, longitude, of, 2, 17, 40, e, or, 2, 2944, e, the, same, coordinates, on, the, datum, ed50, define, a, point, on, the, ground, which, is, 140, metres, 460, feet, distant, from, the, tower, a, web, search, may, produce, several, different, values, for, the, latitude, of, the, tower, the, reference, ellipsoid, is, rarely, specified, the, length, of, a, degree, of, latitude, depends, on, the, figure, of, the, earth, assumed, on, the, sphere, the, normal, passes, through, the, centre, and, the, latitude, is, therefore, equal, to, the, angle, subtended, at, the, centre, by, the, meridian, arc, from, the, equator, to, the, point, concerned, if, the, meridian, distance, is, denoted, by, m, then, where, r, denotes, the, mean, radius, of, the, earth, r, is, equal, to, 6, 371, km, or, 3, 959, miles, no, higher, accuracy, is, appropriate, for, r, since, higher, precision, results, necessitate, an, ellipsoid, model, with, this, value, for, r, the, meridian, length, of, 1, degree, of, latitude, on, the, sphere, is, 111, 2, km, 69, 1, statute, miles, 60, 0, nautical, miles, the, length, of, 1, minute, of, latitude, is, 1, 853, km, 1, 151, statute, miles, 1, 00, nautical, miles, while, the, length, of, 1, second, of, latitude, is, 30, 8, m, or, 101, feet, see, nautical, mile, in, meridian, arc, and, standard, texts, it, is, shown, that, the, distance, along, a, meridian, from, latitude, to, the, equator, is, given, by, in, radians, where, m, is, the, meridional, radius, of, curvature, the, quarter, meridian, distance, from, the, equator, to, the, pole, is, for, wgs84, this, distance, is, 10, 001, 965, 729, km, the, evaluation, of, the, meridian, distance, integral, is, central, to, many, studies, in, geodesy, and, map, projection, it, can, be, evaluated, by, expanding, the, integral, by, the, binomial, series, and, integrating, term, by, term, see, meridian, arc, for, details, the, length, of, the, meridian, arc, between, two, given, latitudes, is, given, by, replacing, the, limits, of, the, integral, by, the, latitudes, concerned, the, length, of, a, small, meridian, arc, is, given, by, when, the, latitude, difference, is, 1, degree, corresponding, to, 180, radians, the, arc, distance, is, about, the, distance, in, metres, correct, to, 0, 01, metre, between, latitudes, displaystyle, phi, 0, 5, degrees, and, displaystyle, phi, 0, 5, degrees, on, the, wgs84, spheroid, is, the, variation, of, this, distance, with, latitude, on, wgs84, is, shown, in, the, table, along, with, the, length, of, a, degree, of, longitude, east, west, distance, a, calculator, for, any, latitude, is, provided, by, the, u, s, government, s, national, geospatial, intelligence, agency, nga, the, following, graph, illustrates, the, variation, of, both, a, degree, of, latitude, and, a, degree, of, longitude, with, latitude, there, are, six, auxiliary, latitudes, that, have, applications, to, special, problems, in, geodesy, geophysics, and, the, theory, of, map, projections, the, definitions, given, in, this, section, all, relate, to, locations, on, the, reference, ellipsoid, but, the, first, two, auxiliary, latitudes, like, the, geodetic, latitude, can, be, extended, to, define, a, three, dimensional, geographic, coordinate, system, as, discussed, below, the, remaining, latitudes, are, not, used, in, this, way, they, are, used, only, as, intermediate, constructs, in, map, projections, of, the, reference, ellipsoid, to, the, plane, or, in, calculations, of, geodesics, on, the, ellipsoid, their, numerical, values, are, not, of, interest, for, example, no, one, would, need, to, calculate, the, authalic, latitude, of, the, eiffel, tower, the, expressions, below, give, the, auxiliary, latitudes, in, terms, of, the, geodetic, latitude, the, semi, major, axis, a, and, the, eccentricity, e, for, inverses, see, below, the, forms, given, are, apart, from, notational, variants, those, in, the, standard, reference, for, map, projections, namely, map, projections, a, working, manual, by, j, p, snyder, derivations, of, these, expressions, may, be, found, in, adams, and, online, publications, by, osborne, and, rapp, the, geocentric, latitude, is, the, angle, between, the, equatorial, plane, and, the, radius, from, the, centre, to, a, point, of, interest, when, the, point, is, on, the, surface, of, the, ellipsoid, the, relation, between, the, geocentric, latitude, and, the, geodetic, latitude, is, for, points, not, on, the, surface, of, the, ellipsoid, the, relationship, involves, additionally, the, ellipsoidal, height, h, where, n, is, the, prime, vertical, radius, of, curvature, the, geodetic, and, geocentric, latitudes, are, equal, at, the, equator, and, at, the, poles, but, at, other, latitudes, they, differ, by, a, few, minutes, of, arc, taking, the, value, of, the, squared, eccentricity, as, 0, 0067, it, depends, on, the, choice, of, ellipsoid, the, maximum, difference, of, displaystyle, phi, theta, may, be, shown, to, be, about, 11, 5, minutes, of, arc, at, a, geodetic, latitude, of, approximately, 45, 6, the, parametric, latitude, or, reduced, latitude, is, defined, by, the, radius, drawn, from, the, centre, of, the, ellipsoid, to, that, point, q, on, the, surrounding, sphere, of, radius, a, which, is, the, projection, parallel, to, the, earth, s, axis, of, a, point, p, on, the, ellipsoid, at, latitude, it, was, introduced, by, legendre, and, bessel, who, solved, problems, for, geodesics, on, the, ellipsoid, by, transforming, them, to, an, equivalent, problem, for, spherical, geodesics, by, using, this, smaller, latitude, bessel, s, notation, u, is, also, used, in, the, current, literature, the, parametric, latitude, is, related, to, the, geodetic, latitude, by, the, alternative, name, arises, from, the, parameterization, of, the, equation, of, the, ellipse, describing, a, meridian, section, in, terms, of, cartesian, coordinates, p, the, distance, from, the, minor, axis, and, z, the, distance, above, the, equatorial, plane, the, equation, of, the, ellipse, is, the, cartesian, coordinates, of, the, point, are, parameterized, by, cayley, suggested, the, term, parametric, latitude, because, of, the, form, of, these, equations, the, parametric, latitude, is, not, used, in, the, theory, of, map, projections, its, most, important, application, is, in, the, theory, of, ellipsoid, geodesics, vincenty, karney, the, rectifying, latitude, is, the, meridian, distance, scaled, so, that, its, value, at, the, poles, is, equal, to, 90, degrees, or, 2, radians, where, the, meridian, distance, from, the, equator, to, a, latitude, is, see, meridian, arc, and, the, length, of, the, meridian, quadrant, from, the, equator, to, the, pole, the, polar, distance, is, using, the, rectifying, latitude, to, define, a, latitude, on, a, sphere, of, radius, defines, a, projection, from, the, ellipsoid, to, the, sphere, such, that, all, meridians, have, true, length, and, uniform, scale, the, sphere, may, then, be, projected, to, the, plane, with, an, equirectangular, projection, to, give, a, double, projection, from, the, ellipsoid, to, the, plane, such, that, all, meridians, have, true, length, and, uniform, meridian, scale, an, example, of, the, use, of, the, rectifying, latitude, is, the, equidistant, conic, projection, snyder, section, 16, the, rectifying, latitude, is, also, of, great, importance, in, the, construction, of, the, transverse, mercator, projection, the, authalic, latitude, after, the, greek, for, same, area, gives, an, equal, area, projection, to, a, sphere, where, and, and, the, radius, of, the, sphere, is, taken, as, an, example, of, the, use, of, the, authalic, latitude, is, the, albers, equal, area, conic, projection, 14, the, conformal, latitude, gives, an, angle, preserving, conformal, transformation, to, the, sphere, where, gd, x, is, the, gudermannian, function, see, also, mercator, projection, the, conformal, latitude, defines, a, transformation, from, the, ellipsoid, to, a, sphere, of, arbitrary, radius, such, that, the, angle, of, intersection, between, any, two, lines, on, the, ellipsoid, is, the, same, as, the, corresponding, angle, on, the, sphere, so, that, the, shape, of, small, elements, is, well, preserved, a, further, conformal, transformation, from, the, sphere, to, the, plane, gives, a, conformal, double, projection, from, the, ellipsoid, to, the, plane, this, is, not, the, only, way, of, generating, such, a, conformal, projection, for, example, the, exact, version, of, the, transverse, mercator, projection, on, the, ellipsoid, is, not, a, double, projection, it, does, however, involve, a, generalisation, of, the, conformal, latitude, to, the, complex, plane, the, isometric, latitude, is, used, in, the, development, of, the, ellipsoidal, versions, of, the, normal, mercator, projection, and, the, transverse, mercator, projection, the, name, isometric, arises, from, the, fact, that, at, any, point, on, the, ellipsoid, equal, increments, of, and, longitude, give, rise, to, equal, distance, displacements, along, the, meridians, and, parallels, respectively, the, graticule, defined, by, the, lines, of, constant, and, constant, divides, the, surface, of, the, ellipsoid, into, a, mesh, of, squares, of, varying, size, the, isometric, latitude, is, zero, at, the, equator, but, rapidly, diverges, from, the, geodetic, latitude, tending, to, infinity, at, the, poles, the, conventional, notation, is, given, in, snyder, page, 15, for, the, normal, mercator, projection, on, the, ellipsoid, this, function, defines, the, spacing, of, the, parallels, if, the, length, of, the, equator, on, the, projection, is, e, units, of, length, or, pixels, then, the, distance, y, of, a, parallel, of, latitude, from, the, equator, is, the, isometric, latitude, is, closely, related, to, the, conformal, latitude, the, formulae, in, the, previous, sections, give, the, auxiliary, latitude, in, terms, of, the, geodetic, latitude, the, expressions, for, the, geocentric, and, parametric, latitudes, may, be, inverted, directly, but, this, is, impossible, in, the, four, remaining, cases, the, rectifying, authalic, conformal, and, isometric, latitudes, there, are, two, methods, of, proceeding, the, plot, to, the, right, shows, the, difference, between, the, geodetic, latitude, and, the, auxiliary, latitudes, other, than, the, isometric, latitude, which, diverges, to, infinity, at, the, poles, for, the, case, of, the, wgs84, ellipsoid, the, differences, shown, on, the, plot, are, in, arc, minutes, in, the, northern, hemisphere, positive, latitudes, in, the, southern, hemisphere, negative, latitudes, the, inequalities, are, reversed, with, equality, at, the, equator, and, the, poles, although, the, graph, appears, symmetric, about, 45, the, minima, of, the, curves, actually, lie, between, 45, 2, and, 45, 6, some, representative, data, points, are, given, in, the, table, below, the, conformal, and, geocentric, latitudes, are, nearly, indistinguishable, a, fact, that, was, exploited, in, the, days, of, hand, calculators, to, expedite, the, construction, of, map, projections, 108, to, first, order, in, the, flattening, f, the, auxiliary, latitudes, can, be, expressed, as, cf, sin, 2, where, the, constant, c, takes, on, the, values, for, the, geodetic, latitude, or, any, of, the, auxiliary, latitudes, defined, on, the, reference, ellipsoid, constitutes, with, longitude, a, two, dimensional, coordinate, system, on, that, ellipsoid, to, define, the, position, of, an, arbitrary, point, it, is, necessary, to, extend, such, a, coordinate, system, into, three, dimensions, three, latitudes, are, used, in, this, way, the, geodetic, geocentric, and, parametric, latitudes, are, used, in, geodetic, coordinates, spherical, polar, coordinates, and, ellipsoidal, coordinates, respectively, at, an, arbitrary, point, p, consider, the, line, pn, which, is, normal, to, the, reference, ellipsoid, the, geodetic, coordinates, p, h, are, the, latitude, and, longitude, of, the, point, n, on, the, ellipsoid, and, the, distance, pn, this, height, differs, from, the, height, above, the, geoid, or, a, reference, height, such, as, that, above, mean, sea, level, at, a, specified, location, the, direction, of, pn, will, also, differ, from, the, direction, of, a, vertical, plumb, line, the, relation, of, these, different, heights, requires, knowledge, of, the, shape, of, the, geoid, and, also, the, gravity, field, of, the, earth, the, geocentric, latitude, is, the, complement, of, the, polar, angle, or, colatitude, in, conventional, spherical, polar, coordinates, in, which, the, coordinates, of, a, point, are, p, r, where, r, is, the, distance, of, p, from, the, centre, o, is, the, angle, between, the, radius, vector, and, the, polar, axis, and, is, longitude, since, the, normal, at, a, general, point, on, the, ellipsoid, does, not, pass, through, the, centre, it, is, clear, that, points, p, on, the, normal, which, all, have, the, same, geodetic, latitude, will, have, differing, geocentric, latitudes, spherical, polar, coordinate, systems, are, used, in, the, analysis, of, the, gravity, field, the, parametric, latitude, can, also, be, extended, to, a, three, dimensional, coordinate, system, for, a, point, p, not, on, the, reference, ellipsoid, semi, axes, oa, and, ob, construct, an, auxiliary, ellipsoid, which, is, confocal, same, foci, f, f, with, the, reference, ellipsoid, the, necessary, condition, is, that, the, product, ae, of, semi, major, axis, and, eccentricity, is, the, same, for, both, ellipsoids, let, u, be, the, semi, minor, axis, od, of, the, auxiliary, ellipsoid, further, let, be, the, parametric, latitude, of, p, on, the, auxiliary, ellipsoid, the, set, u, define, the, ellipsoidal, harmonic, coordinates, or, simply, ellipsoidal, coordinates, 4, 2, 2, although, that, term, is, also, used, to, refer, to, geodetic, coordinate, these, coordinates, are, the, natural, choice, in, models, of, the, gravity, field, for, a, rotating, ellipsoidal, body, the, above, applies, to, a, biaxial, ellipsoid, a, spheroid, as, in, oblate, spheroidal, coordinates, for, a, generalization, see, triaxial, ellipsoidal, coordinates, the, relations, between, the, above, coordinate, systems, and, also, cartesian, coordinates, are, not, presented, here, the, transformation, between, geodetic, and, cartesian, coordinates, may, be, found, in, geographic, coordinate, conversion, the, relation, of, cartesian, and, spherical, polars, is, given, in, spherical, coordinate, system, the, relation, of, cartesian, and, ellipsoidal, coordinates, is, discussed, in, torge, astronomical, latitude, is, the, angle, between, the, equatorial, plane, and, the, true, vertical, direction, at, a, point, on, the, surface, the, true, vertical, the, direction, of, a, plumb, line, is, also, the, gravity, direction, the, resultant, of, the, gravitational, acceleration, mass, based, and, the, centrifugal, acceleration, at, that, latitude, astronomic, latitude, is, calculated, from, angles, measured, between, the, zenith, and, stars, whose, declination, is, accurately, known, in, general, the, true, vertical, at, a, point, on, the, surface, does, not, exactly, coincide, with, either, the, normal, to, the, reference, ellipsoid, or, the, normal, to, the, geoid, the, geoid, is, an, idealized, theoretical, shape, at, mean, sea, level, points, on, land, do, not, lie, precisely, on, the, geoid, and, the, vertical, at, a, point, at, a, specific, time, is, influenced, by, tidal, forces, which, the, theoretical, geoid, averages, out, the, angle, between, the, astronomic, and, geodetic, normals, is, called, vertical, deflection, and, is, usually, a, few, seconds, of, arc, but, it, is, important, in, geodesy, astronomical, latitude, is, not, to, be, confused, with, declination, the, coordinate, astronomers, use, in, a, similar, way, to, specify, the, angular, position, of, stars, north, south, of, the, celestial, equator, see, equatorial, coordinates, nor, with, ecliptic, latitude, the, coordinate, that, astronomers, use, to, specify, the, angular, position, of, stars, north, south, of, the, ecliptic, see, ecliptic, coordinates
