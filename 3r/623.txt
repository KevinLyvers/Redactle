groups, the, quechuas, gradually, as, early, as, the, thirteenth, century, they, began, to, expand, and, incorporate, their, neighbors, inca, expansion, was, slow, until, about, the, middle, of, the, fifteenth, century, when, the, pace, of, conquest, began, to, accelerate, particularly, under, the, rule, of, the, emperor, pachacuti, under, his, rule, and, that, of, his, son, topa, inca, yupanqui, the, incas, came, to, control, most, of, the, andean, region, with, a, population, of, 9, to, 16, million, inhabitants, under, their, rule, pachacuti, also, promulgated, a, comprehensive, code, of,

campaign, that, took, decades, of, fighting, but, ended, in, spanish, victory, and, colonization, of, the, region, known, as, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, with, its, capital, at, lima, which, was, then, known, as, la, ciudad, de, los, reyes, the, city, of, kings, the, conquest, of, peru, led, to, spin, off, campaigns, throughout, the, viceroyalty, as, well, as, expeditions, towards, the, amazon, basin, as, in, the, case, of, spanish, efforts, to, quell, amerindian, resistance, the, last, inca, resistance, was, suppressed, when, the, spaniards, annihilated, the, neo, inca, state, in,

workforce, with, the, discovery, of, the, great, silver, and, gold, lodes, at, potos, present, day, bolivia, and, huancavelica, the, viceroyalty, flourished, as, an, important, provider, of, mineral, resources, peruvian, bullion, provided, revenue, for, the, spanish, crown, and, fueled, a, complex, trade, network, that, extended, as, far, as, europe, and, the, philippines, the, commercial, and, population, exchanges, between, latin, america, and, asia, undergone, via, the, manila, galleons, transiting, through, acapulco, had, callao, at, peru, as, the, furthest, endpoint, of, the, trade, route, in, the, americas, in, relation, to, this, don, sebastian, hurtado, de, corcuera, governor, of, panama, was, also, responsible, for, settling, zamboanga, city, in, the, philippines, by, employing, peruvian, soldiers, and, colonists, african, slaves, were, added, to, the, labor, population, to, expand, the, workforce, the, expansion, of, a, colonial, administrative, apparatus, and, bureaucracy, paralleled, the, economic, reorganization, with, the, conquest, started, the, spread, of, christianity, in, south, america, most, people, were, forcefully, converted, to, catholicism, with, spanish, clerics, believing, like, puritan, divines, of, english, colonies, later, that, the, native, peoples, had, been, corrupted, by, the, devil, who, was, working, through, them, to, frustrate, their, foundations, it, only, took, a, generation, to, convert, the, population, they, built, churches, in, every, city, and, replaced, some, of, the, inca, temples, with, churches, such, as, the, coricancha, in, the, city, of, cusco, the, church, employed, the, inquisition, making, use, of, torture, to, ensure, that, newly, converted, catholics, did, not, stray, to, other, religions, or, beliefs, and, monastery, schools, educating, girls, especially, of, the, inca, nobility, and, upper, class, until, they, were, old, enough, either, to, profess, or, to, leave, the, monastery, and, assume, the, role, estado, in, the, christian, society, that, their, fathers, planned, to, erect, in, peru, peruvian, catholicism, follows, the, syncretism, found, in, many, latin, american, countries, in, which, religious, native, rituals, have, been, integrated, with, christian, celebrations, in, this, endeavor, the, church, came, to, play, an, important, role, in, the, acculturation, of, the, natives, drawing, them, into, the, cultural, orbit, of, the, spanish, settlers, by, the, 18th, century, declining, silver, production, and, economic, diversification, greatly, diminished, royal, income, in, response, the, crown, enacted, the, bourbon, reforms, a, series, of, edicts, that, increased, taxes, and, partitioned, the, viceroyalty, the, new, laws, provoked, t, pac, amaru, ii, s, rebellion, and, other, revolts, all, of, which, were, suppressed, as, a, result, of, these, and, other, changes, the, spaniards, and, their, creole, successors, came, to, monopolize, control, over, the, land, seizing, many, of, the, best, lands, abandoned, by, the, massive, native, depopulation, however, the, spanish, did, not, resist, the, portuguese, expansion, of, brazil, across, the, meridian, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, was, rendered, meaningless, between, 1580, and, 1640, while, spain, controlled, portugal, the, need, to, ease, communication, and, trade, with, spain, led, to, the, split, of, the, viceroyalty, and, the, creation, of, new, viceroyalties, of, new, granada, and, rio, de, la, plata, at, the, expense, of, the, territories, that, formed, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, this, reduced, the, power, prominence, and, importance, of, lima, as, the, viceroyal, capital, and, shifted, the, lucrative, andean, trade, to, buenos, aires, and, bogot, while, the, fall, of, the, mining, and, textile, production, accelerated, the, progressive, decay, of, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, eventually, the, viceroyalty, would, dissolve, as, with, much, of, the, spanish, empire, when, challenged, by, national, independence, movements, at, the, beginning, of, the, nineteenth, century, these, movements, led, to, the, formation, of, the, majority, of, modern, day, countries, of, south, america, in, the, territories, that, at, one, point, or, another, had, constituted, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, the, conquest, and, colony, brought, a, mix, of, cultures, and, ethnicities, that, did, not, exist, before, the, spanish, conquered, the, peruvian, territory, even, though, many, of, the, inca, traditions, were, lost, or, diluted, new, customs, traditions, and, knowledge, were, added, creating, a, rich, mixed, peruvian, culture, two, of, the, most, important, indigenous, rebellions, against, the, spanish, were, that, of, juan, santos, atahualpa, in, 1742, and, rebellion, of, t, pac, amaru, ii, in, 1780, around, the, highlands, near, cuzco, in, the, early, 19th, century, while, most, south, american, nations, were, swept, by, wars, of, independence, peru, remained, a, royalist, stronghold, as, the, elite, vacillated, between, emancipation, and, loyalty, to, the, spanish, monarchy, independence, was, achieved, only, after, the, occupation, by, military, campaigns, of, jos, de, san, mart, n, and, sim, n, bol, var, the, economic, crises, the, loss, of, power, of, spain, in, europe, the, war, of, independence, in, north, america, and, native, uprisings, all, contributed, to, a, favorable, climate, to, the, development, of, emancipation, ideas, among, the, c, riollo, population, in, south, america, however, the, criollo, oligarchy, in, peru, enjoyed, privileges, and, remained, loyal, to, the, spanish, crown, the, liberation, movement, started, in, argentina, where, autonomous, juntas, were, created, as, a, result, of, the, loss, of, authority, of, the, spanish, government, over, its, colonies, after, fighting, for, the, independence, of, the, viceroyalty, of, rio, de, la, plata, jos, de, san, mart, n, created, the, army, of, the, andes, and,

while, cochrane, sailed, north, and, blockaded, the, port, of, callao, in, lima, at, the, same, time, in, the, north, guayaquil, was, occupied, by, rebel, forces, under, the, command, of, gregorio, escobedo, because, peru, was, the, stronghold, of, the, spanish, government, in, south, america, san, mart, n, s, strategy, to, liberate, peru, was, to, use, diplomacy, he, sent, representatives, to, lima, urging, the, viceroy, that, peru, be, granted, independence, however, all, negotiations, proved, unsuccessful, the, viceroy, of, peru, joaqu, n, de, la, pazuela, named, jos, de, la, serna,

which, was, recognized, by, spain, and, he, was, named, viceroy, of, peru, this, internal, power, struggle, contributed, to, the, success, of, the, liberating, army, to, avoid, a, military, confrontation, san, mart, n, met, the, newly, appointed, viceroy, jos, de, la, serna, and, proposed, to, create, a, constitutional, monarchy, a, proposal, that, was, turned, down, de, la, serna,
