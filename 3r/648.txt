sub, saharan, africa, subsahara, or, non, mediterranean, africa, is, the, area, and, regions, of, the, continent, of, africa, that, lie, south, of, the, sahara, these, include, central, africa, east, africa, southern, africa, and, west, africa, geopolitically, in, addition, to, the, african, countries, and, territories, that, are, situated, fully, in, that, specified, region, the, term, may, also, include, polities, that, only, have, part, of, their, territory, located, in, that, region, per, the, definition, of, the, united, nations, un, this, is, considered, a, non, standardized, geographical, region, with, the, number, of, countries, included, varying, from, 46, to, 48, depending, on, the, organization, describing, the, region, e, g, un, who, world, bank, etc, the, african, union, au, uses, a, different, regional, breakdown, recognizing, all, 55, member, states, on, the, continent, grouping, them, into, five, distinct, and, standard, regions, the, term, serves, as, a, grouping, counterpart, to, north, africa, which, is, instead, grouped, with, the, definition, of, mena, i, e, middle, east, and, north, africa, as, it, is, part, of, the, arab, world, and, most, north, african, states, are, likewise, members, of, the, arab, league, however, while, they, are, also, member, states, of, the, arab, league, the, comoros, djibouti, mauritania, and, somalia, and, sometimes, sudan, are, all, geographically, considered, to, be, part, of, sub, saharan, africa, overall, the, un, development, programme, applies, the, sub, saharan, classification, to, 46, of, africa, s, 55, countries, excluding, djibouti, sadr, somalia, and, sudan, since, around, 3900, bce, the, saharan, and, sub, saharan, regions, of, africa, have, been, separated, by, the, extremely, harsh, climate, of, the, sparsely, populated, sahara, forming, an, effective, barrier, that, is, interrupted, only, by, the, nile, in, sudan, though, navigation, on, the, nile, was, blocked, by, the, sudd, and, the, river, s, cataracts, there, is, also, an, evident, genetic, divide, between, north, africa, and, sub, saharan, africa, that, dates, back, to, the, neolithic, the, sahara, pump, theory, explains, how, flora, and, fauna, including, homo, sapiens, left, africa, to, penetrate, eurasia, and, beyond, african, pluvial, periods, are, associated, with, a, wet, sahara, phase, during, which, larger, lakes, and, more, rivers, existed, geographers, historically, divided, the, region, into, several, distinct, ethnographic, sections, based, on, each, area, s, respective, inhabitants, commentators, in, arabic, in, the, medieval, period, used, the, general, term, bil, d, as, s, d, n, land, of, the, blacks, for, the, vast, sudan, region, an, expression, denoting, central, and, west, africa, or, sometimes, extending, from, the, coast, of, west, africa, to, western, sudan, its, equivalent, in, southeast, africa, was, zanj, country, of, the, blacks, which, was, situated, in, the, vicinity, of, the, great, lakes, region, the, geographers, drew, an, explicit, ethnographic, distinction, between, the, sudan, region, and, its, analogue, zanj, from, the, area, to, their, extreme, east, on, the, red, sea, coast, in, the, horn, of, africa, in, modern, day, ethiopia, and, eritrea, was, al, habash, or, abyssinia, which, was, inhabited, by, the, habash, or, abyssinians, who, were, the, forebears, of, the, habesha, in, northern, somalia, was, barbara, or, the, bilad, al, barbar, land, of, the, berbers, which, was, inhabited, by, the, eastern, baribah, or, barbaroi, as, the, ancestors, of, the, somalis, were, referred, to, by, medieval, arab, and, ancient, greek, geographers, respectively, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, populations, south, of, the, sahara, were, divided, into, three, broad, ancestral, groups, hamites, and, semites, in, the, horn, of, africa, and, sahel, related, to, those, in, north, africa, who, spoke, languages, belonging, to, the, afroasiatic, family, negroes, in, most, of, the, rest, of, the, subcontinent, hence, the, toponym, black, africa, for, africa, south, of, the, sahara, who, spoke, languages, belonging, to, the, niger, congo, and, nilo, saharan, families, and, khoisan, in, southern, africa, who, spoke, languages, belonging, to, the, khoisan, family, sub, saharan, africa, has, a, wide, variety, of, climate, zones, or, biomes, south, africa, and, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, in, particular, are, considered, megadiverse, countries, it, has, a, dry, winter, season, and, a, wet, summer, season, according, to, paleontology, early, hominid, skull, anatomy, was, similar, to, that, of, their, close, cousins, the, great, african, forest, apes, gorilla, and, chimpanzee, however, they, had, adopted, a, bipedal, locomotion, and, freed, hands, giving, them, a, crucial, advantage, enabling, them, to, live, in, both, forested, areas, and, on, the, open, savanna, at, a, time, when, africa, was, drying, up, with, savanna, encroaching, on, forested, areas, this, occurred, 10, million, to, 5, million, years, ago, by, 3, million, years, ago, several, australopithecine, hominid, species, had, developed, throughout, southern, east, and, central, africa, they, were, tool, users, rather, than, tool, manufacturers, the, next, major, evolutionary, step, occurred, around, 2, 3, million, bce, when, primitive, stone, tools, were, used, to, scavenge, the, carcasses, of, animals, killed, by, other, predators, both, for, their, meat, and, their, marrow, in, hunting, h, habilis, was, most, likely, not, capable, of, competing, with, large, predators, and, was, more, prey, than, hunter, although, h, habilis, likely, did, steal, eggs, from, nests, and, may, have, been, able, to, catch, small, game, and, weakened, larger, prey, such, as, cubs, and, older, animals, the, tools, were, classed, as, oldowan, roughly, 1, 8, million, years, ago, homo, ergaster, first, appeared, in, the, fossil, record, in, africa, from, homo, ergaster, homo, erectus, upright, man, evolved, 1, 5, million, years, ago, some, of, the, earlier, representatives, of, this, species, were, small, brained, and, used, primitive, stone, tools, much, like, h, habilis, the, brain, later, grew, in, size, and, h, erectus, eventually, developed, a, more, complex, stone, tool, technology, called, the, acheulean, potentially, the, first, hominid, to, engage, in, hunting, h, erectus, mastered, the, art, of, making, fire, they, were, the, first, hominids, to, leave, africa, going, on, to, colonize, the, entire, old, world, and, perhaps, later, on, giving, rise, to, homo, floresiensis, although, some, recent, writers, suggest, that, h, georgicus, a, h, habilis, descendant, was, the, first, and, most, primitive, hominid, to, ever, live, outside, africa, many, scientists, consider, h, georgicus, to, be, an, early, and, primitive, member, of, the, h, erectus, species, the, fossil, and, genetic, evidence, shows, homo, sapiens, developed, in, southern, and, east, africa, by, around, 350, 000, to, 260, 000, years, ago, and, gradually, migrated, across, the, continent, in, waves, between, 50, 000, and, 60, 000, years, ago, their, expansion, out, of, africa, launched, the, colonization, of, the, planet, by, modern, humans, by, 10, 000, bce, homo, sapiens, had, spread, to, all, corners, of, the, world, this, dispersal, of, the, human, species, is, suggested, by, linguistic, cultural, and, genetic, evidence, during, the, 11th, millennium, bp, pottery, was, independently, invented, in, west, africa, with, the, earliest, pottery, there, dating, to, about, 9, 400, bc, from, central, mali, it, spread, throughout, the, sahel, and, southern, sahara, after, the, sahara, became, a, desert, it, did, not, present, a, totally, impenetrable, barrier, for, travelers, between, north, and, south, because, of, the, application, of, animal, husbandry, towards, carrying, water, food, and, supplies, across, the, desert, prior, to, the, introduction, of, the, camel, the, use, of, oxen, mule, and, horses, for, desert, crossing, was, common, and, trade, routes, followed, chains, of, oases, that, were, strung, across, the, desert, the, trans, saharan, trade, was, in, full, motion, by, 500, bce, with, carthage, being, a, major, economic, force, for, its, establishment, it, is, thought, that, the, camel, was, first, brought, to, egypt, after, the, persian, empire, conquered, egypt, in, 525, bce, although, large, herds, did, not, become, common, enough, in, north, africa, for, camels,

to, buy, vast, tracts, of, agricultural, land, in, sub, saharan, africa, could, soon, be, limited, by, a, new, global, international, protocol, according, to, researchers, at, the, overseas, development, institute, the, lack, of, infrastructure, in, many, developing, countries, represents, one, of, the, most, significant, limitations, to, economic, growth, and, achievement, of, the, millennium, development, goals, mdgs, infrastructure, investments, and, maintenance, can, be, very, expensive, especially, in, such, as, areas, as, landlocked, rural, and, sparsely, populated, countries, in, africa, infrastructure, investments, contributed, to, africa, s, growth, and, increased, investment, is, necessary, to, maintain, growth, and, tackle, poverty, the, returns, to, investment, in, infrastructure, are, very, significant, with, on, average, 30, 40, returns, for, telecommunications, ict, investments, over, 40, for, electricity, generation, and, 80, for, roads, in, africa, it, is, argued, that, in, order, to, meet, the, mdgs, infrastructure, investments, would, need, to, reach, about, 15, of, gdp, around, 93, billion, a, year, currently, the, source, of, financing, varies, significantly, across, sectors, some, sectors, are, dominated, by, state, spending, others, by, overseas, development, aid, oda, and, yet, others, by, private, investors, in, sub, saharan, africa, the, state, spends, around, 9, 4, billion, out, of, a, total, of, 24, 9, billion, in, irrigation, ssa, states, represent, almost, all, spending, in, transport, and, energy, a, majority, of, investment, is, state, spending, in, ict, and, water, supply, and, sanitation, the, private, sector, represents, the, majority, of, capital, expenditure, overall, aid, the, private, sector, and, non, oecd, financiers, between, them, exceed, state, spending, the, private, sector, spending, alone, equals, state, capital, expenditure, though, the, majority, is, focused, on, ict,

with, varying, degree, among, countries, this, compares, with, 1, of, gdp, that, is, typical, in, industrialised, countries, and, 2, 3, of, gdp, found, in, fast, growing, emerging, economies, although, the, level, of, expenditure, is, high, relative, to, the, size, of, africa, s, economies, it, remains, small, in, absolute, terms, with, low, income, countries, spending, an, average, of, about, us, 7, per, capita, per, year, forty, per, cent, of, african, scientists, live, in, oecd, countries, predominantly, in, europe, the, united, states, and, canada, this, has, been, described, as, an, african, brain, drain, according, to, naledi, pandor, the, south, african, minister, of, science, and, technology, even, with, the, drain, enrollments, in, sub, saharan, african, universities, tripled, between, 1991, and, 2005, expanding, at, an, annual, rate, of, 8, 7, which, is, one, of, the, highest, regional, growth, rates, in, the, world, in, the, last, 10, to, 15, years, interest, in, pursuing, university, level, degrees, abroad, has, increased, according, to, the, cia, low, global, literacy, rates, are, concentrated, in, sub, saharan, africa, west, asia, and, south, asia, however, literacy, rates, in, sub, saharan, africa, vary, significantly, between, countries, the, highest, registered, literacy, rate, in, the, region, is, in, zimbabwe, 90, 7, 2003, est, while, the, lowest, literacy, rate, is, in, south, sudan, 27, research, on, human, capital, formation, was, able, to, determine, that, the, numeracy, levels, of, sub, saharan, africa, and, africa, in, general, were, higher, than, numeracy, levels, in, south, asia, in, the, 1940s, more, than, 75, of, the, population, of, sub, saharan, africa, was, numerate, the, numeracy, of, the, west, african, countries, benin, and, ghana, was, even, higher, with, more, than, 80, of, the, population, being, numerate, in, contrast, numeracy, in, south, asia, was, only, around, 50, higher, diversity, in, sub, saharan, african, countries, has, been, found, to, lead, to, a, poorer, economy, researchers, have, argued, that, this, is, because, of, ethnic, favoritism, in, their, politics, sub, saharan, leaders, are, more, likely, to, provide, better, resources, to, their, coethnic, groups, when, in, power, a, study, found, that, on, average, children, of, the, favored, ethnic, group, are, 2, 25, more, likely, to, attend, primary, school, and, 1, 80, more, likely, to, complete, primary, school, a, 1, increase, in, gdp, is, associated, with, a, 1, 5, increase, in, the, ethnic, favoritism, effect, on, primary, school, attendance, sub, saharan, african, countries, spent, an, average, of, 0, 3, of, their, gdp, on, science, and, technology, in, 2007, this, represents, an, increase, from, us, 1, 8, billion, in, 2002, to, us, 2, 8, billion, in, 2007, a, 50, increase, in, spending, at, the, world, conference, held, in, jomtien, thailand, in, 1990, delegates, from, 155, countries, and, representatives, of, some, 150, organizations, gathered, with, the, goal, to, promote, universal, primary, education, and, the, radical, reduction, of, illiteracy, before, the, end, of, the, decade, the, world, education, forum, held, ten, years, later, in, dakar, senegal, provided, the, opportunity, to, reiterate, and, reinforce, these, goals, this, initiative, contributed, to, having, education, made, a, priority, of, the, millennium, development, goals, in, 2000, with, the, aim, of, achieving, universal, schooling, mdg2, and, eliminating, gender, disparities, especially, in, primary, and, secondary, education, mdg3, since, the, world, education, forum, in, dakar, considerable, efforts, have, been, made, to, respond, to, these, demographic, challenges, in, terms, of, education, the, amount, of, funds, raised, has, been, decisive, between, 1999, and, 2010, public, spending, on, education, as, a, percentage, of, gross, national, product, gnp, increased, by, 5, per, year, in, sub, saharan, africa, with, major, variations, between, countries, with, percentages, varying, from, 1, 8, in, cameroon, to, over, 6, in, burundi, as, of, 2015, governments, in, sub, saharan, africa, spend, on, average, 18, of, their, total, budget, on, education, against, 15, in, the, rest, of, the, world, in, the, years, immediately, after, the, dakar, forum, the, efforts, made, by, the, african, states, towards, achieving, efa, produced, multiple, results, in, sub, saharan, africa, the, greatest, advance, was, in, access, to, primary, education, which, governments, had, made, their, absolute, priority, the, number, of, children, in, a, primary, school, in, sub, saharan, africa, thus, rose, from, 82, million, in, 1999, to, 136, 4, million, in, 2011, in, niger, for, example, the, number, of, children, entering, school, increased, by, more, than, three, and, a, half, times, between, 1999, and, 2011, in, ethiopia, over, the, same, period, over, 8, 5, million, more, children, were, admitted, to, primary, school, the, net, rate, of, first, year, access, in, sub, saharan, africa, has, thus, risen, by, 19, points, in, 12, years, from, 58, in, 1999, to, 77, in, 2011, despite, the, considerable, efforts, the, latest, available, data, from, the, unesco, institute, for, statistics, estimates, that, for, 2012, there, were, still, 57, 8, million, children, who, were, not, in, school, of, these, 29, 6, million, were, in, sub, saharan, africa, alone, a, figure, which, has, not, changed, for, several, years, many, sub, saharan, countries, have, notably, included, the, first, year, of, secondary, school, in, basic, education, in, rwanda, the, first, year, of, secondary, school, was, attached, to, primary, education, in, 2009, which, significantly, increased, the, number, of, pupils, enrolled, at, this, level, of, education, in, 2012, the, primary, completion, rate, pcr, which, measures, the, proportion, of, children, reaching, the, final, year, of, primary, school, was, 70, meaning, that, more, than, three, out, of, ten, children, entering, primary, school, do, not, reach, the, final, primary, year, literacy, rates, have, gone, up, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, internet, access, has, improved, considerably, at, least, 39, countries, in, sub, saharan, africa, have, some, large, scale, school, feeding, programs, which, can, improve, access, to, education, in, aggregate, 16, of, school, age, children, and, 25, of, primary, school, age, children, in, the, region, benefit, from, school, meal, programs, and, about, 82, of, the, funding, for, these, programs, is, provided, by, governments, nonetheless, a, lot, must, yet, happen, for, this, region, to, catch, up, the, statistics, show, that, the, literacy, rate, for, sub, saharan, africa, was, 65, in, 2017, in, other, words, one, third, of, the, people, aged, 15, and, above, were, unable, to, read, and, write, the, comparative, figure, for, 1984, was, an, illiteracy, rate, of, 49, in, 2017, only, about, 22, of, africans, were, internet, users, at, all, according, to, the, international, telecommunication, union, itu, health, challenges, in, sub, saharan, africa, include, hiv, aids, in, africa, malaria, neglected, tropical, diseases, tuberculosis, onchocerciasis, maternal, mortality, and, infant, mortality, in, 1987, the, bamako, initiative, conference, organized, by, the, world, health, organization, was, held, in, bamako, the, capital, of, mali, and, helped, reshape, the, health, policy, of, sub, saharan, africa, the, new, strategy, dramatically, increased, accessibility, through, community, based, healthcare, reform, resulting, in, more, efficient, and, equitable, provision, of, services, a, comprehensive, approach, strategy, was, extended, to, all, areas, of, health, care, with, subsequent, improvement, in, the, health, care, indicators, and, improvement, in, health, care, efficiency, and, cost, in, 2011, sub, saharan, africa, was, home, to, 69, of, all, people, living,
