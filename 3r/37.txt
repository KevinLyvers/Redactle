the, baltic, sea, is, an, arm, of, the, atlantic, ocean, that, is, enclosed, by, denmark, estonia, finland, germany, latvia, lithuania, poland, russia, sweden, and, the, north, and, central, european, plain, the, sea, stretches, from, 53, n, to, 66, n, latitude, and, from, 10, e, to, 30, e, longitude, it, is, a, shelf, sea, and, marginal, sea, of, the, atlantic, with, limited, water, exchange, between, the, two, making, it, an, inland, sea, the, baltic, sea, drains, through, the, danish, straits, into, the, kattegat, by, way, of, the, resund, great, belt, and, little, belt, it, includes, the, gulf, of, bothnia, divided, into, the, bothnian, bay, and, the, bothnian, sea, the, gulf, of, finland, the, gulf, of, riga, and, the, bay, of, gda, sk, the, baltic, proper, is, bordered, on, its, northern, edge, at, latitude, 60, n, by, land, and, the, gulf, of, bothnia, on, its, northeastern, edge, by, the, gulf, of, finland, on, its, eastern, edge, by, the, gulf, of, riga, and, in, the, west, by, the, swedish, part, of, the, southern, scandinavian, peninsula, the, baltic, sea, is, connected, by, artificial, waterways, to, the, white, sea, via, the, white, sea, baltic, canal, and, to, the, german, bight, of, the, north, sea, via, the, kiel, canal, the, helsinki, convention, on, the, protection, of, the, marine, environment, of, the, baltic, sea, area, includes, the, baltic, sea, and, the, kattegat, without, calling, kattegat, a, part, of, the, baltic, sea, for, the, purposes, of, this, convention, the, baltic, sea, area, shall, be, the, baltic, sea, and, the, entrance, to, the, baltic, sea, bounded, by, the, parallel, of, the, skaw, in, the, skagerrak, at, 57, 44, 43, n, historically, the, kingdom, of, denmark, collected, sound, dues, from, ships, at, the, border, between, the, ocean, and, the, land, locked, baltic, sea, in, tandem, in, the, resund, at, kronborg, castle, near, helsing, r, in, the, great, belt, at, nyborg, and, in, the, little, belt, at, its, narrowest, part, then, fredericia, after, that, stronghold, was, built, the, narrowest, part, of, little, belt, is, the, middelfart, sund, near, middelfart, geographers, widely, agree, that, the, preferred, physical, border, between, the, baltic, and, north, seas, is, the, langelandsb, lt, the, southern, part, of, the, great, belt, strait, near, langeland, and, the, drogden, sill, strait, the, drogden, sill, is, situated, north, of, k, ge, bugt, and, connects, drag, r, in, the, south, of, copenhagen, to, malm, it, is, used, by, the, resund, bridge, including, the, drogden, tunnel, by, this, definition, the, danish, straits, is, part, of, the, entrance, but, the, bay, of, mecklenburg, and, the, bay, of, kiel, are, parts, of, the, baltic, sea, another, usual, border, is, the, line, between, falsterbo, sweden, and, stevns, klint, denmark, as, this, is, the, southern, border, of, resund, it, is, also, the, border, between, the, shallow, southern, resund, with, a, typical, depth, of, 5, 10, meters, only, and, notably, deeper, water, drogden, sill, depth, of, 7, m, 23, ft, sets, a, limit, to, resund, and, darss, sill, depth, of, 18, m, 59, ft, and, a, limit, to, the, belt, sea, the, shallow, sills, are, obstacles, to, the, flow, of, heavy, salt, water, from, the, kattegat, into, the, basins, around, bornholm, and, gotland, the, kattegat, and, the, southwestern, baltic, sea, are, well, oxygenated, and, have, a, rich, biology, the, remainder, of, the, sea, is, brackish, poor, in, oxygen, and, in, species, thus, statistically, the, more, of, the, entrance, that, is, included, in, its, definition, the, healthier, the, baltic, appears, conversely, the, more, narrowly, it, is, defined, the, more, endangered, its, biology, appears, tacitus, called, it, the, suebic, sea, latin, mare, suebicum, after, the, germanic, people, of, the, suebi, and, ptolemy, sarmatian, ocean, after, the, sarmatians, but, the, first, to, name, it, the, baltic, sea, medieval, latin, mare, balticum, was, the, eleventh, century, german, chronicler, adam, of, bremen, the, origin, of, the, latter, name, is, speculative, and, it, was, adopted, into, slavic, and, finnic, languages, spoken, around, the, sea, very, likely, due, to, the, role, of, medieval, latin, in, cartography, it, might, be, connected, to, the, germanic, word, belt, a, name, used, for, two, of, the, danish, straits, the, belts, while, others, claim, it, to, be, directly, derived, from, the, source, of, the, germanic, word, latin, balteus, belt, adam, of, bremen, himself, compared, the, sea, with, a, belt, stating, that, it, is, so, named, because, it, stretches, through, the, land, as, a, belt, balticus, eo, quod, in, modum, baltei, longo, tractu, per, scithicas, regiones, tendatur, usque, in, greciam, he, might, also, have, been, influenced, by, the, name, of, a, legendary, island, mentioned, in, the, natural, history, of, pliny, the, elder, pliny, mentions, an, island, named, baltia, or, balcia, with, reference, to, accounts, of, pytheas, and, xenophon, it, is, possible, that, pliny, refers, to, an, island, named, basilia, the, royal, in, on, the, ocean, by, pytheas, baltia, also, might, be, derived, from, belt, and, therein, mean, near, belt, of, sea, strait, others, have, suggested, that, the, name, of, the, island, originates, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, b, el, meaning, white, fair, which, may, echo, the, naming, of, seas, after, colours, relating, to, the, cardinal, points, as, per, black, sea, and, red, sea, this, b, el, root, and, basic, meaning, were, retained, in, lithuanian, as, baltas, latvian, as, balts, and, slavic, as, bely, on, this, basis, a, related, hypothesis, holds, that, the, name, originated, from, this, indo, european, root, via, a, baltic, language, such, as, lithuanian, another, explanation, is, that, while, derived, from, the, aforementioned, root, the, name, of, the, sea, is, related, to, names, for, various, forms, of, water, and, related, substances, in, several, european, languages, that, might, have, been, originally, associated, with, colors, found, in, swamps, compare, proto, slavic, bolto, swamp, yet, another, explanation, is, that, the, name, originally, meant, enclosed, sea, bay, as, opposed, to, open, sea, in, the, middle, ages, the, sea, was, known, by, a, variety, of, names, the, name, baltic, sea, became, dominant, after, 1600, usage, of, baltic, and, similar, terms, to, denote, the, region, east, of, the, sea, started, only, in, the, 19th, century, the, baltic, sea, was, known, in, ancient, latin, language, sources, as, mare, suebicum, or, even, mare, germanicum, older, native, names, in, languages, that, used, to, be, spoken, on, the, shores, of, the, sea, or, near, it, usually, indicate, the, geographical, location, of, the, sea, in, germanic, languages, or, its, size, in, relation, to, smaller, gulfs, in, old, latvian, or, tribes, associated, with, it, in, old, russian, the, sea, was, known, as, the, varanghian, sea, in, modern, languages, it, is, known, by, the, equivalents, of, east, sea, west, sea, or, baltic, sea, in, different, languages, at, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, the, baltic, sea, was, known, as, the, mare, suebicum, or, mare, sarmaticum, tacitus, in, his, ad, 98, agricola, and, germania, described, the, mare, suebicum, named, for, the, suebi, tribe, during, the, spring, months, as, a, brackish, sea, where, the, ice, broke, apart, and, chunks, floated, about, the, suebi, eventually, migrated, southwest, to, temporarily, reside, in, the, rhineland, area, of, modern, germany, where, their, name, survives, in, the, historic, region, known, as, swabia, jordanes, called, it, the, germanic, sea, in, his, work, the, getica, in, the, early, middle, ages, norse, scandinavian, merchants, built, a, trade, empire, all, around, the, baltic, later, the, norse, fought, for, control, of, the, baltic, against, wendish, tribes, dwelling, on, the, southern, shore, the, norse, also, used, the, rivers, of, russia, for, trade, routes, finding, their, way, eventually, to, the, black, sea, and, southern, russia, this, norse, dominated, period, is, referred, to, as, the, viking, age, since, the, viking, age, the, scandinavians, have, referred, to, the, baltic, sea, as, austmarr, eastern, lake, eastern, sea, appears, in, the, heimskringla, and, eystra, salt, appears, in, s, rla, ttr, saxo, grammaticus, recorded, in, gesta, danorum, an, older, name, gandvik, vik, being, old, norse, for, bay, which, implies, that, the, vikings, correctly, regarded, it, as, an, inlet, of, the, sea, another, form, of, the, name, grandvik, attested, in, at, least, one, english, translation, of, gesta, danorum, is, likely, to, be, a, misspelling, in, addition, to, fish, the, sea, also, provides, amber, especially, from, its, southern, shores, within, today, s, borders, of, poland, russia, and, lithuania, first, mentions, of, amber, deposits, on, the, south, coast, of, the, baltic, sea, date, back, to, the, 12th, century, the, bordering, countries, have, also, traditionally, exported, lumber, wood, tar, flax, hemp, and, furs, by, ship, across, the, baltic, sweden, had, from, early, medieval, times, exported, iron, and, silver, mined, there, while, poland, had, and, still, has, extensive, salt, mines, thus, the, baltic, sea, has, long, been, crossed, by, much, merchant, shipping, the, lands, on, the, baltic, s, eastern, shore, were, among, the, last, in, europe, to, be, converted, to, christianity, this, finally, happened, during, the, northern, crusades, finland, in, the, twelfth, century, by, swedes, and, what, are, now, estonia, and, latvia, in, the, early, thirteenth, century, by, danes, and, germans, livonian, brothers, of, the, sword, the, teutonic, order, gained, control, over, parts, of, the, southern, and, eastern, shore, of, the, baltic, sea, where, they, set, up, their, monastic, state, lithuania, was, the, last, european, state, to, convert, to, christianity, in, the, period, between, the, 8th, and, 14th, centuries, there, was, much, piracy, in, the, baltic, from, the, coasts, of, pomerania, and, prussia, and, the, victual, brothers, held, gotland, starting, in, the, 11th, century, the, southern, and, eastern, shores, of, the, baltic, were, settled, by, migrants, mainly, from, germany, a, movement, called, the, ostsiedlung, east, settling, other, settlers, were, from, the, netherlands, denmark, and, scotland, the, polabian, slavs, were, gradually, assimilated, by, the, germans, denmark, gradually, gained, control, over, most, of, the, baltic, coast, until, she, lost, much, of, her, possessions, after, being, defeated, in, the, 1227, battle, of, bornh, ved, in, the, 13th, to, 16th, centuries, the, strongest, economic, force, in, northern, europe, was, the, hanseatic, league, a, federation, of, merchant, cities, around, the, baltic, sea, and, the, north, sea, in, the, sixteenth, and, early, seventeenth, centuries, poland, denmark, and, sweden, fought, wars, for, dominium, maris, baltici, lordship, over, the, baltic, sea, eventually, it, was, sweden, that, virtually, encompassed, the, baltic, sea, in, sweden, the, sea, was, then, referred, to, as, mare, nostrum, balticum, our, baltic, sea, the, goal, of, swedish, warfare, during, the, 17th, century, was, to, make, the, baltic, sea, an, all, swedish, sea, ett, svenskt, innanhav, something, that, was, accomplished, except, the, part, between, riga, in, latvia, and, stettin, in, pomerania, however, the, dutch, dominated, the, baltic, trade, in, the, seventeenth, century, in, the, eighteenth, century, russia, and, prussia, became, the, leading, powers, over, the, sea, sweden, s, defeat, in, the, great, northern, war, brought, russia, to, the, eastern, coast, russia, became, and, remained, a, dominating, power, in, the, baltic, russia, s, peter, the, great, saw, the, strategic, importance, of, the, baltic, and, decided, to, found, his, new, capital, saint, petersburg, at, the, mouth, of, the, neva, river, at, the, east, end, of, the, gulf, of, finland, there, was, much, trading, not, just, within, the, baltic, region, but, also, with, the, north, sea, region, especially, eastern, england, and, the, netherlands, their, fleets, needed, the, baltic, timber, tar, flax, and, hemp, during, the, crimean, war, a, joint, british, and, french, fleet, attacked, the, russian, fortresses, in, the, baltic, the, case, is, also, known, as, the, land, war, they, bombarded, sveaborg, which, guards, helsinki, and, kronstadt, which, guards, saint, petersburg, and, they, destroyed, bomarsund, in, land, after, the, unification, of, germany, in, 1871, the, whole, southern, coast, became, german, world, war, i, was, partly, fought, in, the, baltic, sea, after, 1920, poland, was, granted, access, to, the, baltic, sea, at, the, expense, of, germany, by, the, polish, corridor, and, enlarged, the, port, of, gdynia, in, rivalry, with, the, port, of, the, free, city, of, danzig, after, the, nazis, rise, to, power, germany, reclaimed, the, memelland, and, after, the, outbreak, of, the, eastern, front, world, war, ii, occupied, the, baltic, states, in, 1945, the, baltic, sea, became, a, mass, grave, for, retreating, soldiers, and, refugees, on, torpedoed, troop, transports, the, sinking, of, the, wilhelm, gustloff, remains, the, worst, maritime, disaster, in, history, killing, very, roughly, 9, 000, people, in, 2005, a, russian, group, of, scientists, found, over, five, thousand, airplane, wrecks, sunken, warships, and, other, material, mainly, from, world, war, ii, on, the, bottom, of, the, sea, since, the, end, of, world, war, ii, various, nations, including, the, soviet, union, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, have, disposed, of, chemical, weapons, in, the, baltic, sea, raising, concerns, of, environmental, contamination, today, fishermen, occasionally, find, some, of, these, materials, the, most, recent, available, report, from, the, helsinki, commission, notes, that, four, small, scale, catches, of, chemical, munitions, representing, approximately, 105, kg, 231, lb, of, material, were, reported, in, 2005, this, is, a, reduction, from, the, 25, incidents, representing, 1, 110, kg, 2, 450, lb, of, material, in, 2003, until, now, the, u, s, government, refuses, to, disclose, the, exact, coordinates, of, the, wreck, sites, deteriorating, bottles, leak, mustard, gas, and, other, substances, thus, slowly, poisoning, a, substantial, part, of, the, baltic, sea, after, 1945, the, german, population, was, expelled, from, all, areas, east, of, the, oder, neisse, line, making, room, for, new, polish, and, russian, settlement, poland, gained, most, of, the, southern, shore, the, soviet, union, gained, another, access, to, the, baltic, with, the, kaliningrad, oblast, that, had, been, part, of, german, settled, east, prussia, the,

climates, transition, from, moderate, continental, to, subarctic, on, the, northernmost, coastlines, on, the, long, term, average, the, baltic, sea, is, ice, covered, at, the, annual, maximum, for, about, 45, of, its, surface, area, the, ice, covered, area, during, such, a, typical, winter, includes, the, gulf, of, bothnia, the, gulf, of, finland, the, gulf, of, riga, the, archipelago, west, of, estonia, the, stockholm, archipelago, and, the, archipelago, sea, southwest, of, finland, the, remainder, of, the, baltic, does, not, freeze, during, a, normal, winter, except, sheltered, bays, and, shallow, lagoons, such, as, the, curonian, lagoon, the, ice, reaches, its, maximum, extent, in, february, or, march, typical, ice, thickness, in, the, northernmost, areas, in, the, bothnian, bay, the, northern, basin, of, the, gulf, of, bothnia, is, about, 70, cm, 28, in, for, landfast, sea, ice, the, thickness, decreases, farther, south, freezing, begins, in, the, northern, extremities, of, the,

ice, extent, depends, on, whether, the, winter, is, mild, moderate, or, severe, in, severe, winters, ice, can, form, around, southern, sweden, and, even, in, the, danish, straits, according, to, the, 18th, century, natural, historian, william, derham, during, the, severe, winters, of, 1703, and, 1708, the, ice, cover, reached, as, far, as, the, danish, straits, frequently, parts, of, the, gulf, of, bothnia, and, the, gulf, of, finland, are, frozen, in, addition, to, coastal, fringes, in, more, southerly, locations, such, as, the, gulf, of, riga, this, description, meant, that, the, whole, of, the, baltic, sea, was, covered, with, ice, since, 1720, the, baltic, sea, has, frozen, over, entirely, 20, times, most, recently, in, early, 1987, which, was, the, most, severe, winter, in, scandinavia, since, 1720, the, ice, then, covered, 400, 000, km, 2, 150, 000, sq, mi, during, the, winter, of, 2010, 11, which, was, quite, severe, compared, to, those, of, the, last, decades, the, maximum, ice, cover, was, 315, 000, km, 2, 122, 000, sq, mi, which, was, reached, on, 25, february, 2011, the, ice, then, extended, from, the, north, down, to, the, northern, tip, of, gotland, with, small, ice, free, areas, on, either, side, and, the, east, coast, of, the, baltic, sea, was, covered, by, an, ice, sheet, about, 25, to, 100, km, 16, to, 62, mi, wide, all, the, way, to, gda, sk, this, was, brought, about, by, a, stagnant, high, pressure, area, that, lingered, over, central, and, northern, scandinavia, from, around, 10, to, 24, february, after, this, strong, southern, winds, pushed, the, ice, further, into, the, north, and, much, of, the, waters, north, of, gotland, were, again, free, of, ice, which, had, then, packed, against, the, shores, of, southern, finland, the, effects, of, the, afore, mentioned, high, pressure, area, did, not, reach, the, southern, parts, of, the, baltic, sea, and, thus, the, entire, sea, did, not, freeze, over, however, floating, ice, was, additionally, observed, near, winouj, cie, harbor, in, january, 2010, in, recent, years, before, 2011, the, bothnian, bay, and, the, bothnian, sea, were, frozen, with, solid, ice, near, the, baltic, coast, and, dense, floating, ice, far, from, it, in, 2008, almost, no, ice, formed, except, for, a, short, period, in, march, during, winter, fast, ice, which, is, attached, to, the, shoreline, develops, first, rendering, ports, unusable, without, the, services, of, icebreakers, level, ice, ice, sludge, pancake, ice, and, rafter, ice, form, in, the, more, open, regions, the, gleaming, expanse, of, ice, is, similar, to, the, arctic, with, wind, driven, pack, ice, and, ridges, up, to, 15, m, 49, ft, offshore, of, the, landfast, ice, the, ice, remains, very, dynamic, all, year, and, it, is, relatively, easily, moved, around, by, winds, and, therefore, forms, pack, ice, made, up, of, large, piles, and, ridges, pushed, against, the, landfast, ice, and, shores, in, spring, the, gulf, of, finland, and, the, gulf, of, bothnia, normally, thaw, in, late, april, with, some, ice, ridges, persisting, until, may, in, the, eastern, extremities, of, the, gulf, of, finland, in, the, northernmost, reaches, of, the, bothnian, bay, ice, usually, stays, until, late, may, by, early, june, it, is, practically, always, gone, however, in, the, famine, year, of, 1867, remnants, of, ice, were, observed, as, late, as, 17, july, near, uddsk, r, even, as, far, south, as, resund, remnants, of, ice, have, been, observed, in, may, on, several, occasions, near, taarbaek, on, 15, may, 1942, and, near, copenhagen, on, 11, may, 1771, drift, ice, was, also, observed, on, 11, may, 1799, the, ice, cover, is, the, main, habitat, for, two, large, mammals, the, grey, seal, halichoerus, grypus, and, the, baltic, ringed, seal, pusa, hispida, botnica, both, of, which, feed, underneath, the, ice, and, breed, on, its, surface, of, these, two, seals, only, the, baltic, ringed, seal, suffers, when, there, is, not, adequate, ice, in, the, baltic, sea, as, it, feeds, its, young, only, while, on, ice, the, grey, seal, is, adapted, to, reproducing, also, with, no, ice, in, the, sea, the, sea, ice, also, harbors, several, species, of, algae, that, live, in, the, bottom, and, inside, unfrozen, brine, pockets, in, the, ice, due, to, the, often, fluctuating, winter, temperatures, between, above, and, below, freezing, the, saltwater, ice, of, the, baltic, sea, can, be, treacherous, and, hazardous, to, walk, on, in, particular, in, comparison, to, the, more, stable, fresh, water, ice, sheets, in, the, interior, lakes, the, baltic, sea, flows, out, through, the, danish, straits, however, the, flow, is, complex, a, surface, layer, of, brackish, water, discharges, 940, km, 3, 230, cu, mi, per, year, into, the, north, sea, due, to, the, difference, in, salinity, by, salinity, permeation, principle, a, sub, surface, layer, of, more, saline, water, moving, in, the, opposite, direction, brings, in, 475, km, 3, 114, cu, mi, per, year, it, mixes, very, slowly, with, the, upper, waters, resulting, in, a, salinity, gradient, from, top, to, bottom, with, most, of, the, saltwater, remaining, below, 40, to, 70, m, 130, to, 230, ft, deep, the, general, circulation, is, anti, clockwise, northwards, along, its, eastern, boundary, and, south, along, with, the, western, one, the, difference, between, the, outflow, and, the, inflow, comes, entirely, from, fresh, water, more, than, 250, streams, drain, a, basin, of, about, 1, 600, 000, km, 2, 620, 000, sq, mi, contributing, a, volume, of, 660, km, 3, 160, cu, mi, per, year, to, the, baltic, they, include, the, major, rivers, of, north, europe, such, as, the, oder, the, vistula, the, neman, the, daugava, and, the, neva, additional, fresh, water, comes, from, the, difference, of, precipitation, less, evaporation, which, is, positive, an, important, source, of, salty, water, is, infrequent, inflows, also, known, as, major, baltic, inflows, or, mbis, of, north, sea, water, into, the, baltic, such, inflows, important, to, the, baltic, ecosystem, because, of, the, oxygen, they, transport, into, the, baltic, deeps, happen, on, average, once, per, year, but, large, pulses, that, can, replace, the, anoxic, deep, water, in, the, gotland, deep, occur, about, once, in, ten, years, previously, it, was, believed, that, the, frequency, of, mbis, had, declined, since, 1980, but, recent, studies, have, challenged, this, view, and, no, longer, display, a, clear, change, in, the, frequency, or, intensity, of, saline, inflows, instead, a, decadal, variability, in, the, intensities, of, mbis, is, observed, with, a, main, period, of, approximately, 30, years, the, water, level, is, generally, far, more, dependent, on, the, regional, wind, situation, than, on, tidal, effects, however, tidal, currents, occur, in, narrow, passages, in, the, western, parts, of, the, baltic, sea, tides, can, reach, 17, to, 19, cm, 6, 7, to, 7, 5, in, in, the, gulf, of, finland, the, significant, wave, height, is, generally, much, lower, than, that, of, the, north, sea, quite, violent, sudden, storms, sweep, the, surface, ten, or, more, times, a, year, due, to, large, transient, temperature, differences, and, a, long, reach, of, the, wind, seasonal, winds, also, cause, small, changes, in, sea, level, of, the, order, of, 0, 5, m, 1, ft, 8, in, according, to, the, media, during, a, storm, in, january, 2017, an, extreme, wave, above, 14, m, 46, ft, has, been, measured, and, significant, wave, height, of, around, 8, m, 26, ft, has, been, measured, by, the, fmi, a, numerical, study, has, shown, the, presence, of, events, with, 8, to, 10, m, 26, to, 33, ft, significant, wave, heights, those, extreme, waves, events, can, play, an, important, role, in, the, coastal, zone, on, erosion, and, sea, dynamics, the, baltic, sea, is, the, world, s, largest, inland, brackish, sea, only, two, other, brackish, waters, are, larger, according, to, some, measurements, the, black, sea, is, larger, in, both, surface, area, and, water, volume, but, most, of, it, is, located, outside, the, continental, shelf, only, a, small, fraction, is, inland, the, caspian, sea, is, larger, in, water, volume, but, despite, its, name, it, is, a, lake, rather, than, a, sea, the, baltic, sea, s, salinity, is, much, lower, than, that, of, ocean, water, which, averages, 3, 5, as, a, result, of, abundant, freshwater, runoff, from, the, surrounding, land, rivers, streams, and, alike, combined, with, the, shallowness, of, the, sea, itself, runoff, contributes, roughly, one, fortieth, its, total, volume, per, year, as, the, volume, of, the, basin, is, about, 21, 000, km, 3, 5, 000, cu, mi, and, yearly, runoff, is, about, 500, km, 3, 120, cu, mi, the, open, surface, waters, of, the, baltic, sea, proper, generally, have, a, salinity, of, 0, 3, to, 0, 9, which, is, border, line, freshwater, the, flow, of, freshwater, into, the, sea, from, approximately, two, hundred, rivers, and, the, introduction, of, salt, from, the, southwest, builds, up, a, gradient, of, salinity, in, the, baltic, sea, the, highest, surface, salinities, generally, 0, 7, 0, 9, are, in, the, southwesternmost, part, of, the, baltic, in, the, arkona, and, bornholm, basins, the, former, located, roughly, between, southeast, zealand, and, bornholm, and, the, latter, directly, east, of, bornholm, it, gradually, falls, further, east, and, north, reaching, the, lowest, in, the, bothnian, bay, at, around, 0, 3, drinking, the, surface, water, of, the, baltic, as, a, means, of, survival, would, actually, hydrate, the, body, instead, of, dehydrating, as, is, the, case, with, ocean, water, as, saltwater, is, denser, than, freshwater, the, bottom, of, the, baltic, sea, is, saltier, than, the, surface, this, creates, a, vertical, stratification, of, the, water, column, a, halocline, that, represents, a, barrier, to, the, exchange, of, oxygen, and, nutrients, and, fosters, completely, separate, maritime, environments, the, difference, between, the, bottom, and, surface, salinities, varies, depending, on, location, overall, it, follows, the, same, southwest, to, east, and, north, pattern, as, the, surface, at, the, bottom, of, the, arkona, basin, equalling, depths, greater, than, 40, m, or, 130, ft, and, bornholm, basin, depths, greater, than, 80, m, or, 260, ft, it, is, typically, 1, 4, 1, 8, further, east, and, north, the, salinity, at, the, bottom, is, consistently, lower, being, the, lowest, in, bothnian, bay, depths, greater, than, 120, m, or, 390, ft, where, it, is, slightly, below, 0, 4, or, only, marginally, higher, than, the, surface, in, the, same, region, in, contrast, the, salinity, of, the, danish, straits, which, connect, the, baltic, sea, and, kattegat, tends, to, be, significantly, higher, but, with, major, variations, from, year, to, year, for, example, the, surface, and, bottom, salinity, in, the, great, belt, is, typically, around, 2, 0, and, 2, 8, respectively, which, is, only, somewhat, below, that, of, the, kattegat, the, water, surplus, caused, by, the, continuous, inflow, of, rivers, and, streams, to, the, baltic, sea, means, that, there, generally, is, a, flow, of, brackish, water, out, through, the, danish, straits, to, the, kattegat, and, eventually, the, atlantic, significant, flows, in, the, opposite, direction, salt, water, from, the, kattegat, through, the, danish, straits, to, the, baltic, sea, are, less, regular, and, are, known, as, major, baltic, inflows, mbis, the, rating, of, mean, discharges, differs, from, the, ranking, of, hydrological, lengths, from, the, most, distant, source, to, the, sea, and, the, rating, of, the, nominal, lengths, g, ta, lv, a, tributary, of, the, kattegat, is, not, listed, as, due, to, the, northward, upper, low, salinity, flow, in, the, sea, its, water, hardly, reaches, the, baltic, proper, countries, that, border, the, sea, denmark, estonia, finland, germany, latvia, lithuania, poland, russia, sweden, countries, lands, in, the, outer, drainage, basin, belarus, czech, republic, norway, slovakia, ukraine, the, baltic, sea, drainage, basin, is, roughly, four, times, the, surface, area, of, the, sea, itself, about, 48, of, the, region, is, forested, with, sweden, and, finland, containing, the, majority, of, the, forest, especially, around, the, gulfs, of, bothnia, and, finland, about, 20, of, the, land, is, used, for, agriculture, and, pasture, mainly, in, poland, and, around, the, edge, of, the, baltic, proper, in, germany, denmark, and, sweden, about, 17, of, the, basin, is, unused, open, land, with, another, 8, of, wetlands, most, of, the, latter, are, in, the, gulfs, of, bothnia, and, finland, the, rest, of, the, land, is, heavily, populated, about, 85, million, people, live, in, the, baltic, drainage, basin, 15, million, within, 10, km, 6, mi, of, the, coast, and, 29, million, within, 50, km, 31, mi, of, the, coast, around, 22, million, live, in, population, centers, of, over, 250, 000, 90, of, these, are, concentrated, in, the, 10, km, 6, mi, band, around, the, coast, of, the, nations, containing, all, or, part, of, the, basin, poland, includes, 45, of, the, 85, million, russia, 12, sweden, 10, and, the, others, less, than, 6, each, the, biggest, coastal, cities, by, population, other, important, ports, the, baltic, sea, somewhat, resembles, a, riverbed, with, two, tributaries, the, gulf, of, finland, and, gulf, of, bothnia, geological, surveys, show, that, before, the, pleistocene, instead, of, the, baltic, sea, there, was, a, wide, plain, around, a, great, river, that, paleontologists, call, the, eridanos, several, pleistocene, glacial, episodes, scooped, out, the, river, bed, into, the, sea, basin, by, the, time, of, the, last, or, eemian, stage, mis, 5e, the, eemian, sea, was, in, place, instead, of, a, true, sea, the, baltic, can, even, today, also, be, understood, as, the, common, estuary, of, all, rivers, flowing, into, it, from, that, time, the, waters, underwent, a, geologic, history, summarized, under, the, names, listed, below, many, of, the, stages, are, named, after, marine, animals, e, g, the, littorina, mollusk, that, are, clear, markers, of, changing, water, temperatures, and, salinity, the, factors, that, determined, the, sea, s, characteristics, were, the, submergence, or, emergence, of, the, region, due, to, the, weight, of, ice, and, subsequent, isostatic, readjustment, and, the, connecting, channels, it, found, to, the, north, sea, atlantic, either, through, the, straits, of, denmark, or, at, what, are, now, the, large, lakes, of, sweden, and, the, white, sea, arctic, sea, the, land, is, still, emerging, isostatically, from, its, depressed, state, which, was, caused, by, the, weight, of, ice, during, the, last, glaciation, the, phenomenon, is, known, as, post, glacial, rebound, consequently, the, surface, area, and, the, depth, of, the, sea, are, diminishing, the, uplift, is, about, eight, millimeters, per, year, on, the, finnish, coast, of, the, northernmost, gulf, of, bothnia, in, the, area, the, former, seabed, is, only, gently, sloping, leading, to, large, areas, of, land, being, reclaimed, in, what, are, geologically, speaking, relatively, short, periods, decades, and, centuries, the, baltic, sea, anomaly, is, a, feature, on, an, indistinct, sonar, image, taken, by, swedish, salvage, divers, on, the, floor, of, the, northern, baltic, sea, in, june, 2011, the, treasure, hunters, suggested, the, image, showed, an, object, with, unusual, features, of, seemingly, extraordinary, origin, speculation, published, in, tabloid, newspapers, claimed, that, the, object, was, a, sunken, ufo, a, consensus, of, experts, and, scientists, say, that, the, image, most, likely, shows, a, natural, geological, formation, the, fauna, of, the, baltic, sea, is, a, mixture, of, marine, and, freshwater, species, among, marine, fishes, are, atlantic, cod, atlantic, herring, european, hake, european, plaice, european, flounder, shorthorn, sculpin, and, turbot, and, examples, of, freshwater, species, include, european, perch, northern, pike, whitefish, and, common, roach, freshwater, species, may, occur, at, outflows, of, rivers, or, streams, in, all, coastal, sections, of, the, baltic, sea, otherwise, marine, species, dominate, in, most, sections, of, the, baltic, at, least, as, far, north, as, g, vle, where, less, than, one, tenth, are, freshwater, species, further, north, the, pattern, is, inverted, in, the, bothnian, bay, roughly, two, thirds, of, the, species, are, freshwater, in, the, far, north, of, this, bay, saltwater, species, are, almost, entirely, absent, for, example, the, common, starfish, and, shore, crab, two, species, that, are, very, widespread, along, european, coasts, are, both, unable, to, cope, with, the, significantly, lower, salinity, their, range, limit, is, west, of, bornholm, meaning, that, they, are, absent, from, the, vast, majority, of, the, baltic, sea, some, marine, species, like, the, atlantic, cod, and, european, flounder, can, survive, at, relatively, low, salinities, but, need, higher, salinities, to, breed, which, therefore, occurs, in, deeper, parts, of, the, baltic, sea, the, common, blue, mussel, is, the, dominating, animal, species, and, makes, up, more, than, 90, of, the, total, animal, biomass, in, the, sea, there, is, a, decrease, in, species, richness, from, the, danish, belts, to, the, gulf, of, bothnia, the, decreasing, salinity, along, this, path, causes, restrictions, in, both, physiology, and, habitats, at, more, than, 600, species, of, invertebrates, fish, aquatic, mammals, aquatic, birds, and, macrophytes, the, arkona, basin, roughly, between, southeast, zealand, and, bornholm, is, far, richer, than, other, more, eastern, and, northern, basins, in, the, baltic, sea, which, all, have, less, than, 400, species, from, these, groups, with, the, exception, of, the, gulf, of, finland, with, more, than, 750, species, however, even, the, most, diverse, sections, of, the, baltic, sea, have, far, fewer, species, than, the, almost, full, saltwater, kattegat, which, is, home, to, more, than, 1600, species, from, these, groups, the, lack, of, tides, has, affected, the, marine, species, as, compared, with, the, atlantic, since, the, baltic, sea, is, so, young, there, are, only, two, or, three, known, endemic, species, the, brown, alga, fucus, radicans, and, the, flounder, platichthys, solemdali, both, appear, to, have, evolved, in, the, baltic, basin, and, were, only, recognized, as, species, in, 2005, and, 2018, respectively, having, formerly, been, confused, with, more, widespread, relatives, the, tiny, copenhagen, cockle, parvicardium, hauniense, a, rare, mussel, is, sometimes, considered, endemic, but, has, now, been, recorded, in, the, mediterranean, however, some, consider, non, baltic, records, to, be, misidentifications, of, juvenile, lagoon, cockles, cerastoderma, glaucum, several, widespread, marine, species, have, distinctive, subpopulations, in, the, baltic, sea, adapted, to, the, low, salinity, such, as, the, baltic, sea, forms, of, the, atlantic, herring, and, lumpsucker, which, are, smaller, than, the, widespread, forms, in, the, north, atlantic, a, peculiar, feature, of, the, fauna, is, that, it, contains, a, number, of, glacial, relict, species, isolated, populations, of, arctic, species, which, have, remained, in, the, baltic, sea, since, the, last, glaciation, such, as, the, large, isopod, saduria, entomon, the, baltic, subspecies, of, ringed, seal, and, the, fourhorn, sculpin, some, of, these, relicts, are, derived, from, glacial, lakes, such, as, monoporeia, affinis, which, is, a, main, element, in, the, benthic, fauna, of, the, low, salinity, bothnian, bay, cetaceans, in, the, baltic, sea, are, monitored, by, the, countries, bordering, the, sea, and, data, compiled, by, various, intergovernmental, bodies, such, as, ascobans, a, critically, endangered, population, of, harbor, porpoise, inhabit, the, baltic, proper, whereas, the, species, is, abundant, in, the, outer, baltic, western, baltic, and, danish, straits, and, occasionally, oceanic, and, out, of, range, species, such, as, minke, whales, bottlenose, dolphins, beluga, whales, orcas, and, beaked, whales, visit, the, waters, in, recent, years, very, small, but, with, increasing, rates, fin, whales, and, humpback, whales, migrate, into, baltic, sea, including, mother, and, calf, pair, now, extinct, atlantic, grey, whales, remains, found, from, gr, s, along, bothnian, sea, southern, bothnian, gulf, and, ystad, and, eastern, population, of, north, atlantic, right, whales, that, is, facing, functional, extinction, once, migrated, into, baltic, sea, other, notable, megafauna, include, the, basking, sharks, satellite, images, taken, in, july, 2010, revealed, a, massive, algal, bloom, covering, 377, 000, square, kilometres, 146, 000, sq, mi, in, the, baltic, sea, the, area, of, the, bloom, extended, from, germany, and, poland, to, finland, researchers, of, the, phenomenon, have, indicated, that, algal, blooms, have, occurred, every, summer, for, decades, fertilizer, runoff, from, surrounding, agricultural, land, has, exacerbated, the, problem, and, led, to, increased, eutrophication, approximately, 100, 000, km, 2, 38, 610, sq, mi, of, the, baltic, s, seafloor, a, quarter, of, its, total, area, is, a, variable, dead, zone, the, more, saline, and, therefore, denser, water, remains, on, the, bottom, isolating, it, from, surface, waters, and, the, atmosphere, this, leads, to, decreased, oxygen, concentrations, within, the, zone, it, is, mainly, bacteria, that, grow, in, it, digesting, organic, material, and, releasing, hydrogen, sulfide, because, of, this, large, anaerobic, zone, the, seafloor, ecology, differs, from, that, of, the, neighboring, atlantic, plans, to, artificially, oxygenate, areas, of, the, baltic, that, have, experienced, eutrophication, have, been, proposed, by, the, university, of, gothenburg, and, inocean, ab, the, proposal, intends, to, use, wind, driven, pumps, to, pump, oxygen, rich, surface, water, to, a, depth, of, around, 130, m, after, world, war, ii, germany, had, to, be, disarmed, and, large, quantities, of, ammunition, stockpiles, were, disposed, directly, into, the, baltic, sea, and, the, north, sea, environmental, experts, and, marine, biologists, warn, that, these, ammunition, dumps, pose, an, environmental, threat, with, potentially, life, threatening, consequences, to, the, health, and, safety, of, humans, on, the, coastlines, of, these, seas, climate, change, pollution, from, agriculture, and, forestry, impose, such, strong, effects, on, the, ecosystems, of, the, baltic, sea, that, there, is, a, concern, the, sea, will, turn, from, a, carbon, sink, to, a, source, of, co2, and, methane, construction, of, the, great, belt, bridge, in, denmark, completed, 1997, and, the, resund, bridge, tunnel, completed, 1999, linking, denmark, with, sweden, provided, a, highway, and, railroad, connection, between, sweden, and, the, danish, mainland, the, jutland, peninsula, precisely, the, zealand, the, undersea, tunnel, of, the, resund, bridge, tunnel, provides, for, navigation, of, large, ships, into, and, out, of, the, baltic, sea, the, baltic, sea, is, the, main, trade, route, for, the, export, of, russian, petroleum, many, of, the, countries, neighboring, the, baltic, sea, have, been, concerned, about, this, since, a, major, oil, leak, in, a, seagoing, tanker, would, be, disastrous, for, the, baltic, given, the, slow, exchange, of, water, the, tourism, industry, surrounding, the, baltic, sea, is, naturally, concerned, about, oil, pollution, much, shipbuilding, is, carried, out, in, the, shipyards, around, the, baltic, sea, the, largest, shipyards, are, at, gda, sk, gdynia, and, szczecin, poland, kiel, germany, karlskrona, and, malm, sweden, rauma, turku, and, helsinki, finland,
