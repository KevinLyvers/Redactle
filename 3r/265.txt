pseudo, etymology, from, russian, kurit, to, smoke, due, to, the, continual, fumes, and, steam, above, the, islands, from, volcanoes, the, kuril, islands, form, part, of, the, ring, of, tectonic, instability, encircling, the, pacific, ocean, referred, to, as, the, ring, of, fire, the, islands, themselves, are, summits, of, stratovolcanoes, that, are, a, direct, result, of, the, subduction, of, the, pacific, plate, under, the, okhotsk, plate, which, forms, the, kuril, trench, some, 200, kilometres, 124, mi, east, of, the, islands, the, chain, has, around, 100, volcanoes, some, 40, of, which, are, active, and, many, hot, springs, and, fumaroles, there, is, frequent, seismic, activity, including, a, magnitude, 8, 5, earthquake, in, 1963, and, one, of, magnitude, 8, 3, recorded, on, november, 15, 2006, which, resulted, in, tsunami, waves, up, to, 1, 5, metres, 5, ft, reaching, the, california, coast, raikoke, island, near, the, centre, of, the, archipelago, has, an, active, volcano, which, erupted, again, in, june, 2019, with, emissions, reaching, 13, 000, m, 42, 651, ft, the, climate, on, the, islands, is, generally, severe, with, long, cold, stormy, winters, and, short, and, notoriously, foggy, summers, the, average, annual, precipitation, is, 40, to, 50, inches, 1, 020, to, 1, 270, mm, a, large, portion, of, which, falls, as, snow, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, of, most, of, the, kurils, is, subarctic, dfc, although, kunashir, is, humid, continental, dfb, however, the, kuril, islands, climate, resembles, the, subpolar, oceanic, climate, of, southwest, alaska, much, more, than, the, hypercontinental, climate, of, manchuria, and, interior, siberia, as, precipitation, is, heavy, and, permafrost, completely, absent, it, is, characterized, by, mild, summers, with, only, 1, to, 3, months, above, 10, c, or, 50, f, and, cold, snowy, extremely, windy, winters, below, 3, c, or, 26, 6, f, although, usually, above, 10, c, or, 14, f, the, chain, ranges, from, temperate, to, sub, arctic, climate, types, and, the, vegetative, cover, consequently, ranges, from, tundra, in, the, north, to, dense, spruce, and, larch, forests, on, the, larger, southern, islands, the, highest, elevations, on, the, islands, are, alaid, volcano, highest, point, 2, 339, m, or, 7, 674, ft, on, atlasov, island, at, the, northern, end, of, the, chain, and, tyatya, volcano, 1, 819, m, or, 5, 968, ft, on, kunashir, island, at, the, southern, end, landscape, types, and, habitats, on, the, islands, include, many, kinds, of, beach, and, rocky, shores, cliffs, wide, rivers, and, fast, gravelly, streams, forests, grasslands, alpine, tundra, crater, lakes, and, peat, bogs, the, soils, are, generally, productive, owing, to, the, periodic, influxes, of, volcanic, ash, and, in, certain, places, owing, to, significant, enrichment, by, seabird, guano, however, many, of, the, steep, unconsolidated, slopes, are, susceptible, to, landslides, and, newer, volcanic, activity, can, entirely, denude, a, landscape, only, the, southernmost, island, has, large, areas, covered, by, trees, while, more, northerly, islands, have, no, trees, or, spotty, tree, cover, the, northernmost, atlasov, island, oyakoba, in, japanese, is, an, almost, perfect, volcanic, cone, rising, sheer, out, of, the, sea, it, has, been, praised, by, the, japanese, in, haiku, wood, block, prints, and, other, forms, in, much, the, same, way, as, the, better, known, mount, fuji, its, summit, is, the, highest, point, in, sakhalin, oblast, owing, to, their, location, along, the, pacific, shelf, edge, and, the, confluence, of, okhotsk, sea, gyre, and, the, southward, oyashio, current, the, kuril, islands, are, surrounded, by, waters, that, are, among, the, most, productive, in, the, north, pacific, supporting, a, wide, range, and, high, abundance, of, marine, life, invertebrates, extensive, kelp, beds, surrounding, almost, every, island, provide, crucial, habitat, for, sea, urchins, various, mollusks, and, countless, other, invertebrates, and, their, associated, predators, many, species, of, squid, provide, a, principal, component, of, the, diet, of, many, of, the, smaller, marine, mammals, and, birds, along, the, chain, fish, further, offshore, walleye, pollock, pacific, cod, several, species, of, flatfish, are, of, the, greatest, commercial, importance, during, the, 1980s, migratory, japanese, sardine, was, one, of, the, most, abundant, fish, in, the, summer, pinniped, the, main, pinnipeds, were, a, significant, object, of, harvest, for, the, indigenous, populations, of, the, kuril, islands, both, for, food, and, materials, such, as, skin, and, bone, the, long, term, fluctuations, in, the, range, and, distribution, of, human, settlements, along, the, kuril, island, presumably, tracked, the, pinniped, ranges, in, historical, times, fur, seals, were, heavily, exploited, for, their, fur, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, and, several, of, the, largest, reproductive, rookeries, as, on, raykoke, island, were, extirpated, in, contrast, commercial, harvest, of, the, true, seals, and, steller, sea, lions, has, been, relatively, insignificant, on, the, kuril, islands, proper, since, the, 1960s, there, has, been, essentially, no, additional, harvest, and, the, pinniped, populations, in, the, kuril, islands, appear, to, be, fairly, healthy, and, in, some, cases, expanding, the, notable, exception, is, the, now, extinct, japanese, sea, lion, which, was, known, to, occasionally, haul, out, on, the, kuril, islands, sea, otters, sea, otters, were, exploited, very, heavily, for, their, pelts, in, the, 19th, century, as, shown, by, 19th, and, 20th, century, whaling, catch, and, sighting, records, seabirds, the, kuril, islands, are, home, to, many, millions, of, seabirds, including, northern, fulmars, tufted, puffins, murres, kittiwakes, guillemots, auklets, petrels, gulls, and, cormorants, on, many, of, the, smaller, islands, in, summer, where, terrestrial, predators, are, absent, virtually, every, possibly, hummock, cliff, niche, or, underneath, of, boulder, is, occupied, by, a, nesting, bird, several, of, the, islands, including, kunashir, and, the, lesser, kuril, chain, in, the, south, kurils, and, the, northern, kurils, from, urup, to, paramushir, have, been, recognised, as, important, bird, areas, ibas, by, birdlife, international, because, they, support, populations, of, various, threatened, bird, species, including, many, waterbirds, seabirds, and, waders, the, composition, of, terrestrial, species, on, the, kuril, islands, is, dominated, by, asian, mainland, taxa, via, migration, from, hokkaido, and, sakhalin, islands, and, by, kamchatkan, taxa, from, the, north, while, highly, diverse, there, is, a, relatively, low, level, of, endemism, on, a, species, level, the, wwf, divides, the, kuril, islands, into, two, ecoregions, the, southern, kurils, along, with, southwestern, sakhalin, comprise, the, south, sakhalin, kurile, mixed, forests, ecoregion, the, northern, islands, are, part, of, the, kamchatka, kurile, meadows, and, sparse, forests, a, larger, ecoregion, that, extends, onto, the, kamchatka, peninsula, and, commander, islands, because, of, the, generally, smaller, size, and, isolation, of, the, central, islands, few, major, terrestrial, mammals, have, colonized, these, though, red, and, arctic, foxes, were, introduced, for, the, sake, of, the, fur, trade, in, the, 1880s, the, bulk, of, the, terrestrial, mammal, biomass, is, taken, up, by, rodents, many, introduced, in, historical, times, the, largest, southernmost, and, northernmost, islands, are, inhabited, by, brown, bear, foxes, and, martens, leopards, once, inhabited, the, islands, some, species, of, deer, are, found, on, the, more, southerly, islands, it, is, claimed, that, a, wild, cat, the, kurilian, bobtail, originates, from, the, kuril, islands, the, bobtail, is, due, to, the, mutation, of, a, dominant, gene, the, cat, has, been, domesticated, and, exported, to, nearby, russia, and, bred, there, becoming, a, popular, domestic, cat, among, terrestrial, birds, ravens, peregrine, falcons, some, wrens, and, wagtails, are, common, the, ainu, people, inhabited, the, kuril, islands, from, early, times, although, few, records, predate, the, 17th, century, from,
