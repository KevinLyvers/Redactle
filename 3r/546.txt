by, the, original, settlers, proved, unable, to, cope, with, the, increasing, power, of, icelandic, chieftains, the, internal, struggles, and, civil, strife, of, the, age, of, the, sturlungs, led, to, the, signing, of, the, old, covenant, in, 1262, which, ended, the, commonwealth, and, brought, iceland, under, the, norwegian, crown, possession, of, iceland, passed, from, the, kingdom, of, norway,
