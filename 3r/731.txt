probably, briefly, disputed, by, the, kingdom, of, hungary, and, bulgarians, in, the, following, period, but, it, appears, that, the, severe, weakening, of, hungarian, authority, during, the, mongol, attacks, contributed, to, the, establishment, of, the, new, and, stronger, polities, attested, in, wallachia, for, the, following, decades, one, of, the, first, written, pieces, of, evidence, of, local, voivodes, is, in, connection, with, litovoi, 1272, who, ruled, over, land, each, side, of, the, carpathians, including, ha, eg, country, in, transylvania, and, refused, to, pay, tribute, to, ladislaus, iv, of, hungary, his, successor, was, his, brother, b, rbat, 1285, 1288, the, continuing, weakening, of, the, hungarian, state, by, further, mongol, invasions, 1285, 1319, and, the, fall, of, the, rp, d, dynasty, opened, the, way, for, the, unification, of, wallachian, polities, and, to, independence, from, hungarian, rule, wallachia, s, creation, held, by, local, traditions, to, have,

either, side, of, the, olt, establishing, his, residence, in, c, mpulung, as, the, first, ruler, of, the, house, of, basarab, basarab, refused, to, grant, hungary, the, lands, of, f, g, ra, alma, and,

as, far, as, kiliya, in, the, budjak, reportedly, providing, the, origin, of, bessarabia, the, supposed, rule, over, the, latter, was, not, preserved, by, the, princes, that, followed, as, kilia, was, under, the, rule, of, the, nogais, c, 1334, there, is, evidence, that, the, second, bulgarian, empire, ruled, at, least, nominally, the, wallachian, lands, up, to, the, ruc, r, bran, corridor, as, late, as, the, late, 14th, century, in, a, charter, by, radu, i, the, wallachian, voivode, requests, that, tsar, ivan, alexander, of, bulgaria, order, his, customs, officers, at, ruc, r, and, the, d,

conceded, to, recognize, him, as, overlord, in, 1368, but, rebelled, again, in, the, same, year, his, rule, also, witnessed, the, first, confrontation, between, wallachia, and, the, ottoman, empire, a, battle, in, which, vladislav, was, allied, with, ivan, shishman, as, the, entire, balkans, became, an, integral, part, of, the, growing, ottoman, empire, a, process, that, concluded, with, the, fall, of, constantinople, to, sultan, mehmed, the, conqueror, in, 1453, wallachia, became, engaged, in, frequent, confrontations, in, the, final, years, of, the, reign, of, mircea, i, r, 1386, 1418, mircea, initially, defeated, the, ottomans, in, several, battles, including, the, battle, of, rovine, in, 1394, driving, them, away, from, dobruja, and, briefly, extending, his, rule, to, the, danube,

interruptions, until, 1829, in, 1418, 1420, michael, i, defeated, the, ottomans, in, severin, only, to, be, killed, in, battle, by, the, counter, offensive, in, 1422, the, danger, was, averted, for, a, short, while, when, dan, ii, inflicted, a, defeat, on, murad, ii, with, the, help, of, pippo, spano, the, peace, signed, in, 1428, inaugurated, a, period, of, internal, crisis, as, dan, had, to, defend, himself, against, radu, ii, who, led, the, first, in, a, series, of, boyar, coalitions, against, established, princes, victorious, in, 1431, the, year, when, the, boyar, backed, alexander, i, aldea, took, the, throne, boyars, were, dealt, successive, blows, by, vlad, ii, dracul, 1436, 1442, 1443, 1447, who, nevertheless, attempted, to, compromise, between, the, ottoman, sultan, and, the, holy, roman, empire, the, following, decade, was, marked, by, the, conflict, between, the, rival, houses, of, d, ne, ti, and, dr, cule, ti, faced, with, both, internal, and, external, conflict, vlad,

known, as, vlad, iii, the, impaler, or, vlad, iii, dracula, he, immediately, put, to, death, the, boyars, who, had, conspired, against, his, father, and, was, characterized, as, both, a, national, hero, and, a, cruel, tyrant, he, was, cheered, for, restoring, order, to, a, destabilized, principality, yet, showed, no, mercy, toward, thieves, murderers, or, anyone, who, plotted, against, his, rule, vlad, demonstrated, his, intolerance, for, criminals, by, utilizing, impalement, as, a, form, of, execution, vlad, fiercely, resisted, ottoman, rule, having, both, repelled, the, ottomans, and, been, pushed, back, several, times, the, transylvanian, saxons, were, also, furious, with, him, for, strengthening, the, borders, of, wallachia, which, interfered, with, their, control, of, trade, routes, in, retaliation, the, saxons, distributed, grotesque, poems, of, cruelty, and, other, propaganda, demonizing, vlad, iii, dracula, as, a, drinker, of, blood, these, tales, strongly, influenced, an, eruption, of, vampiric, fiction, throughout, the, west, and, in, particular, germany, they, also, inspired, the, main, character, in, the, 1897, gothic, novel, dracula, by, bram, stoker, in, 1462,

pay, an, increased, tribute, meanwhile, vlad, iii, faced, parallel, conflicts, with, his, brother, radu, cel, frumos, r, 1437, 1439, 1475, and, basarab, laiot, cel, b, tr, n, this, led, to, the, conquest, of, wallachia, by, radu, who, would, face, his, own, struggles, with, the, resurgent, vlad, iii, and, basarab, laiot, cel, b, tr, n, during, his, 11, year, reign, subsequently, radu, iv, the, great, radu, cel, mare, who, ruled, 1495, 1508, reached, several, compromises, with, the, boyars, ensuring, a, period, of, internal, stability, that, contrasted, his, clash, with, bogdan, iii, the, one, eyed, of, moldavia, the, late, 15th, century, saw, the, ascension, of, the, powerful, craiove, ti, family, virtually, independent, rulers, of, the, oltenian, banat, who, sought, ottoman, support, in, their, rivalry, with, mihnea, cel, r, u, 1508, 1510, and, replaced, him, with, vl, du, after, the, latter, proved, to, be, hostile, to, the, bans, the, house, of, basarab, formally,

teodosie, the, country, was, again, under, a, four, month, long, ottoman, occupation, a, military, administration, that, seemed, to, be, an, attempt, to, create, a, wallachian, pashaluk, this, danger,

the, brave, with, its, break, with, ottoman, rule, tense, relations, with, other, european, powers, and, the, leadership, of, the, three, states, was, considered, in, later, periods, as, the, precursor, of, a, modern, romania, a, thesis, which, was, argued, with, noted, intensity, by, nicolae, b, lcescu, following, michael, s, downfall, wallachia, was, occupied, by, the, polish, moldavian,

irreversible, after, the, ascension, of, carol, i, in, 1866, coinciding, with, the, austro, prussian, war, it, came, at, a, time, when, austria, the, main, opponent, of, the, decision, was, not, in, a, position, to, intervene, slavery, romanian, robie, was, part, of, the, social, order, from, before, the, founding, of, the, principality, of, wallachia, until, it, was, abolished, in, stages, during, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, most, of, the, slaves, were, of, roma, gypsy, ethnicity, the, very, first, document, attesting, the, presence, of, roma, people, in, wallachia, dates, back, to, 1385, and, refers, to, the, group, as, a, igani, from, the, greek, athinganoi, the, origin, of, the, romanian, term, igani, which, is, synonymous, with, gypsy, although, the, romanian, terms, robie, and, sclavie, appear, to, be, synonyms, in, terms, of, legal, status, there, are, significant, differences, sclavie, was, the, term, corresponding, to, the, legal, institution, during, the, roman, era, where, slaves, were, considered, goods, instead, of, human, beings, and, the, owners, had, ius, vitae, necisque, over, them, right, to, end, the, life, of, the, slave, while, robie, is, the, feudal, institution, where, the, slaves, were, legally, considered, human, beings, and, they, had, reduced, legal, capacity, the, exact, origins, of, slavery, in, wallachia, are, not, known, slavery, was, a, common, practice, in, eastern, europe, at, the, time, and, there, is, some, debate, over, whether, the, romani, people, came, to, wallachia, as, free, people, or, as, slaves, in, the, byzantine, empire, they, were, slaves, of, the, state, and, it, seems, the, situation, was, the, same, in, bulgaria, and, serbia, until, their, social, organization, was, destroyed, by, the, ottoman, conquest, which, would, suggest, that, they, came, as, slaves, who, had, a, change, of, ownership, historian, nicolae, iorga, associated, the, roma, people, s, arrival, with, the, 1241, mongol, invasion, of, europe, and, considered, their, slavery, as, a, vestige, of, that, era, the, romanians, taking, the, roma, from, the, mongols, as, slaves, and, preserving, their, status, other, historians, consider, that, they, were, enslaved, while, captured, during, the, battles, with, the, tatars, the, practice, of, enslaving, prisoners, may, also, have, been, taken, from, the, mongols, while, it, is, possible, that, some, romani, people, were, slaves, or, auxiliary, troops, of, the, mongols, or, tatars, the, bulk, of, them, came, from, south, of, the, danube, at, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, some, time, after, the, foundation, of, wallachia, the, arrival, of, the, roma, made, slavery, a, widespread, practice, traditionally, roma, slaves, were, divided, into, three, categories, the, smallest, was, owned, by, the, hospodars, and, went, by, the, romanian, language, name, of, igani, domne, ti, gypsies, belonging, to, the, lord, the, two, other, categories, comprised, igani, m, n, stire, ti, gypsies, belonging, to, the, monasteries, who, were, the, property, of, romanian, orthodox, and, greek, orthodox, monasteries, and, igani, boiere, ti, gypsies, belonging, to, the, boyars, who, were, enslaved, by, the, category, of, landowners, the, abolition, of, slavery, was, carried, out, following, a, campaign, by, young, revolutionaries, who, embraced, the, liberal, ideas, of, the, enlightenment, the, earliest, law, which, freed, a, category, of, slaves, was, in, march, 1843, which, transferred, the, control, of, the, state, slaves, owned, by, the, prison, authority, to, the, local, authorities, leading, to, their, sedentarizing, and, becoming, peasants, during, the, wallachian, revolution, of, 1848, the, agenda, of, the, provisional, government, included, the, emancipation, dezrobire, of, the, roma, as, one, of, the, main, social, demands, by, the, 1850s, the, movement, gained, support, from, almost, the, whole, of, romanian, society, and, the, law, from,
