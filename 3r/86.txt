the, great, australian, bight, is, a, large, oceanic, bight, or, open, bay, off, the, central, and, western, portions, of, the, southern, coastline, of, mainland, australia, there, are, two, definitions, for, its, extent, one, by, the, international, hydrographic, organization, iho, and, another, by, the, australian, hydrographic, service, ahs, the, bight, is, generally, considered, part, of, the, indian, ocean, although, the, ahs, classifies, it, as, part, of, the, southern, ocean, its, coastline, is, characterized, by, cliff, faces, and, rocky, capes, making, it, an, ideal, location, for, whale, watching, this, oceanic, feature, was, first, encountered, by, european, explorers, in, 1627, and, was, accurately, charted, by, english, navigator, matthew, flinders, in, 1802, the, great, australian, bight, came, into, existence, about, 50, million, years, ago, when, the, supercontinent, gondwana, broke, apart, separating, antarctica, from, australia, the, bight, s, waters, are, highly, biodiverse, especially, in, zooplankton, due, to, specific, ocean, currents, however, more, research, is, needed, to, fully, understand, the, region, s, complex, ecosystems, and, the, potential, impacts, of, human, activities, such, as, resource, extraction, southern, bluefin, tuna, are, a, popular, fishing, target, in, the, bight, and, there, have, been, attempts, to, explore, the, area, for, oil, and, gas, since, the, 1960s, however, these, proposals, have, faced, significant, opposition, due, to, the, potential, environmental, impacts, two, definitions, of, the, extent, are, in, use, one, used, by, the, international, hydrographic, organization, iho, and, the, other, used, by, the, australian, hydrographic, service, ahs, the, iho, defines, the, great, australian, bight, as, having, the, following, limits, on, the, north, the, south, coast, of, the, australian, mainland, on, the, south, a, line, joining, west, cape, howe, 35, 08, s, 117, 37, e, 35, 133, s, 117, 617, e, 35, 133, 117, 617, australia, to, south, west, cape, tasmania, on, the, east, a, line, from, cape, otway, victoria, to, king, island, and, thence, to, cape, grim, the, northwest, extreme, of, tasmania, the, ahs, defines, the, bight, with, a, smaller, area, from, cape, pasley, western, australia, to, cape, carnot, south, australia, a, distance, of, 1, 160, kilometres, 720, mi, much, of, the, bight, lies, due, south, of, the, expansive, nullarbor, plain, which, straddles, south, australia, and, western, australia, the, eyre, highway, passes, close, to, the, cliffs, of, the, bight, between, the, head, of, the, bight, and, eucla, outside, of, australia, the, great, australian, bight, is, generally, considered, part, of, the, indian, ocean, the, ahs, considers, it, to, be, part, of, the, southern, ocean, using, the, expanded, australian, definition, used, for, this, ocean, the, iho, in, its, limits, of, oceans, and, seas, both, the, currently, in, force, 1953, edition, and, the, 2002, never, approved, draft, includes, the, bight, with, the, indian, ocean, while, bass, strait, and, the, tasman, sea, are, included, by, iho, with, the, south, pacific, ocean, in, the, 2002, draft, in, the, 1953, edition, iho, includes, bass, strait, as, part, of, the, indian, ocean, the, area, around, cape, pasley, is, an, eastern, outcrop, of, the, ancient, crystalline, rocks, of, the, yilgarn, craton, from, there, the, coast, curves, north, eastwards, with, an, escarpment, parallel, to, the, coast, the, israelite, plain, lies, between, the, escarpment, here, called, the, wylie, scarp, and, the, shore, with, a, chain, of, coastal, lagoons, behind, coastal, dunes, as, the, coast, turns, eastwards, the, escarpment, meets, the, shore, creating, the, baxter, cliffs, which, extend, for, 200, km, 120, mi, near, cocklebiddy, the, escarpment, curves, inland, again, here, the, roe, plains, extends, for, about, 300, km, 190, mi, along, the, coast, reaching, about, 35, km, 22, mi, inland, at, their, widest, point, there, are, extensive, dunefields, near, the, shore, some, bare, of, vegetation, and, others, stabilized, by, coastal, strand, vegetation, shrubland, and, mallee, woodland, near, eucla, and, the, western, australia, south, australia, border, the, escarpment, reaches, the, coast, again, and, the, bunda, cliffs, or, nullarbor, cliffs, extend, for, 220, km, 140, mi, to, head, of, the, bight, at, head, of, the, bight, the, escarpment, turns, inland, to, the, northeast, the, coastline, of, the, western, eyre, peninsula, is, characterised, by, rocky, capes, bays, and, islands, including, fowlers, bay, smoky, bay, streaky, bay, and, the, nuyts, archipelago, the, coastline, is, formed, from, aeolianite, limestone, waves, and, currents, have, formed, beaches, and, dunes, from, eroded, aeolianite, sand, the, southern, eyre, peninsula, is, an, outcrop, of, the, granitic, gawler, craton, the, great, australian, bight, was, first, encountered, by, european, explorers, in, 1627, when, dutch, navigator, fran, ois, thijssen, sailed, along, its, western, margins, the, coast, was, later, first, accurately, charted, by, the, english, navigator, matthew, flinders, in, 1802, during, his, circumnavigation, of, the, australian, continent, a, later, land, based, survey, was, accomplished, by, the, english, explorer, edward, john, eyre, the, bight, came, into, existence, when, gondwana, broke, apart, and, separated, antarctica, from, australia, around, 50, million, years, ago, the, coastline, of, the, great, australian, bight, is, characterised, by, cliff, faces, up, to, 60, metres, or, 200, feet, high, surfing, beaches, and, rock, platforms, ideal, for, whale, watching, this, is, a, popular, activity, during, the, southern, hemisphere, winter, when, increasing, numbers, of, southern, right, whales, migrate, to, the, region, from, their, summer, feeding, grounds, in, the, antarctic, the, whales, come, to, the, bight, region, especially, to, the, head, of, bight, to, calve, and, breed, and, do, not, feed, until, they, return, to, the, antarctic, their, numbers, were, severely, depleted, by, whaling, particularly, during, the, 19th, century, but, have, since, recovered, to, some, extent, the, nullarbor, plain, which, borders, much, of, the, length, of, the, bight, s, coastline, is, a, former, seabed, uplifted, during, the, miocene, consisting, of, limestone, it, is, very, flat, and, has, an, arid, or, semi, arid, climate, with, very, little, rainfall, and, high, summer, temperatures, and, high, evaporation, rates, it, has, no, surface, drainage, but, has, a, karst, drainage, system, through, cave, formation, in, the, underlying, limestone, north, of, the, nullarbor, lies, the, great, victoria, desert, which, has, an, internal, drainage, system, terminating, in, numerous, small, salt, lakes, the, lack, of, surface, runoff, and, terrestrial, nutrients, results, in, the, relatively, shallow, waters, of, the, great, australian, bight, being, generally, low, in, nutrients, and, therefore, oligotrophic, compared, with, many, other, continental, shelves, which, support, major, fisheries, seasonal, upwelling, of, deep, ocean, water, along, the, coast, of, the, eyre, peninsula, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, bight, brings, nutrients, to, the, surface, waters, with, the, resulting, fertility, creating, an, important, marine, hotspot, the, waters, of, the, great, australian, bight, are, highly, biodiverse, particularly, in, zooplankton, due, to, a, particular, series, of, ocean, currents, a, literature, review, undertaken, by, sardi, south, australian, research, and, development, institute, on, the, benthic, protection, zone, of, the, great, australian, bight, marine, park, in, 2003, states, upwelling, events, during, summer, and, autumn, produce, cool, patches, of, surface, water, along, the, coast, of, the, southern, eyre, peninsula, these, patches, contain, elevated, nutrient, concentrations, and, support, enhanced, levels, of, primary, productivity, high, densities, of, zooplankton, to, the, northwest, of, the, patches, indicate, that, the, prevailing, southeasterly, winds, transport, the, products, of, this, enhanced, biological, production, into, the, central, gab, these, plankton, communities, support, the, highest, densities, of, small, planktivorous, fishes, including, sardine, and, anchovy, in, australian, waters, juvenile, southern, bluefin, tuna, sbt, migrate, into, the, gab, annually, to, feed, on, these, rich, pelagic, resources, as, the, nutrients, are, swept, up, from, the, deep, water, ocean, floor, and, pushed, in, towards, the, coast, the, food, chain, is, injected, with, a, massive, influx, of, the, bottom, rung, there, is, not, enough, known, about, the, full, scope, of, species, that, dwell, in, or, migrate, to, the, great, australian, bight, so, more, studies, are, required, the, interim, marine, and, coastal, regionalisation, of, australia, imcra, classification, suggests, that, high, biodiversity, in, the, gab, may, be, explained, by, the, presence, of, temperate, species, with, eastern, and, western, affinities, as, well, as, tropical, stragglers, from, northern, regions, however, patterns, of, diversity, vary, between, taxa, mangroves, are, poorly, represented, due, to, the, lack, of, estuaries, seagrasses, are, confined, mainly, to, sheltered, bays, and, the, lees, of, reefs, and, islands, due, to, the, frequent, disturbance, of, inshore, habitats, by, large, swells, in, contrast, the, macroalgal, assemblage, of, the, gab, is, one, of, the, world, s, most, diverse, and, includes, 1200, species, over, 90, of, species, in, most, invertebrate, groups, are, endemic, to, southern, australia, but, the, proportion, that, is, confined, to, the, gab, is, unknown, there, is, still, much, research, needed, to, fully, understand, the, complex, ecosystems, of, the, great, australian, bight, and, how, any, resource, extraction, or, other, human, activity, may, affect, them, the, literature, review, also, states, approximately, 370, of, the, 600, fish, species, that, occur, in, southern, australia, have, been, recorded, in, sa, several, species, including, the, coastal, stingaree, urolophus, orarius, and, crested, threefin, trinorfolkia, cristata, are, restricted, to, south, australia, and, occur, in, the, gab, the, patterns, of, distribution, and, abundance, of, fishes, in, the, gab, are, poorly, understood, there, are, some, clear, findings, from, the, review, the, gab, provides, critical, habitat, for, two, species, of, marine, mammals, that, are, recognised, internationally, as, being, priorities, for, conservation, the, southern, right, whale, eubalaena, australis, which, is, listed, as, endangered, under, the, commonwealth, environment, protection, and, biodiversity, conservation, act, 1999, breeds, at, the, head, of, bight, during, winter, the, australian, sea, lion, neophoca, cinerea, which, is, endemic, to, australia, and, is, currently, listed, as, near, threatened, breeds, in, small, colonies, along, the, cliffs, of, the, gab, these, marine, mammals, require, this, habitat, to, remain, in, existence, which, has, been, recognised, by, australian, law, one, location, on, the, bight, that, is, specifically, oriented, towards, the, understanding, of, the, natural, history, on, its, coastline, is, the, eyre, bird, observatory, economically, the, bight, has, been, exploited, over, many, years, as, part, of, the, fishing, whaling, and, shellfish, industries, southern, bluefin, tuna, have, been, a, favoured, target, of, fishing, in, the, bight, exploration, for, oil, and, gas, in, the, great, australian, bight, first, began, in, the, late, 1960s, several, oil, majors, bp, statoil, equinor, and, chevron, proposed, plans, to, drill, exploration, wells, in, the, southern, part, of, the, area, from, 2017, onwards, on, 11, october, 2016, bp, withdrew, its, plans, to, explore, the, area, stating, that, it, was, not, competitive, and, did, not, align, with, bp, s, strategic, goals, the, proposal, to, explore, in, the, bight, was, the, focus, of, community, opposition, the, wilderness, society, showed, that, a, worst, case, scenario, leak, of, oil, could, have, a, catastrophic, effect, on, the, southern, coastline, of, australia, the, australian, senate, commenced, an, inquiry, into, oil, or, gas, production, in, the, great, australian, bight, on, 22, february, 2016, the, committee, was, reestablished, on, 13, september, 2016, following, the, australian, federal, election, in, october, 2017, chevron, withdrew, from, the, project, but, it, returned, alongside, bp, in, 2019, though, the, national, offshore, petroleum, safety, and, environmental, management, authority, approved, exploration, plans, in, late, 2019, equinor, withdrew, from, the, project, in, february, 2020, citing, profitability, reasons, the, settlements, existing, along, the, coastline, of, the, bight, such, as, ceduna, and, eucla, have, facilities, to, access, the, bight, some, other, locations, on, the, eyre, highway, or, located, on, the, nullarbor, do, not, have, facilities, or, easy, access
