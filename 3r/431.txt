the, royal, national, park, is, a, protected, national, park, that, is, located, in, sutherland, shire, local, government, area, in, the, southern, portion, of, sydney, new, south, wales, australia, the, 151, square, kilometre, 58, sq, mi, national, park, is, about, 29, kilometres, 18, mi, south, of, the, sydney, central, business, district, near, the, localities, of, loftus, otford, and, waterfall, it, was, founded, by, sir, john, robertson, acting, premier, of, new, south, wales, and, formally, proclaimed, on, 26, april, 1879, a, mere, 7, years, after, yellowstone, national, park, 1872, and, 11, years, before, yosemite, national, park, in, the, united, states, although, yosemite, had, been, federally, protected, land, since, 1864, it, did, not, become, a, national, park, until, 1890, it, was, the, first, national, park, to, be, declared, in, australia, its, original, name, was, just, national, park, but, it, was, renamed, in, 1955, after, elizabeth, ii, queen, of, australia, passed, by, in, the, train, during, her, 1954, tour, the, park, was, added, to, the, australian, national, heritage, list, in, december, 2006, the, park, is, situated, in, traditional, lands, of, the, dharawal, an, aboriginal, australian, people, the, park, includes, today, s, settlements, of, audley, maianbar, and, bundeena, there, was, once, a, railway, line, connected, to, the, eastern, suburbs, illawarra, line, but, this, closed, and, was, converted, to, a, heritage, tramway, operated, by, the, sydney, tramway, museum, in, loftus, audley, can, be, accessed, by, road, from, loftus, waterfall, or, otford, and, there, are, several, railway, stations, loftus, engadine, heathcote, waterfall, helensburgh, and, otford, on, the, outskirts, of, the, park, bundeena, and, maianbar, can, also, be, accessed, by, road, through, the, park, or, by, the, passenger, ferry, service, from, cronulla, there, are, numerous, cycling, and, walking, trails, barbecue, areas, and, picnic, sites, throughout, the, park, over, 100, kilometres, 62, mi, of, walking, tracks, take, in, a, wide, range, of, scenery, cycling, is, allowed, on, some, fire, trails, and, only, on, specially, marked, tracks, within, the, park, the, specially, marked, mountain, biking, tracks, are, bi, directional, care, should, be, taken, when, traversing, these, trails, a, fee, of, 12, 00, applies, when, taking, a, car, into, the, park, the, most, popular, walk, is, the, coast, walk, which, skirts, the, park, s, eastern, edge, and, delivers, exceptional, coastal, scenery, it, is, a, 30, kilometre, track, involving, walking, from, bundeena, to, otford, or, vice, versa, it, s, recommended, that, walkers, allow, 2, days, for, the, walk, this, walk, is, often, done, as, part, of, the, duke, of, edinburgh, s, award, the, wallumarra, track, wallumarra, is, an, aboriginal, word, for, education, protect, was, constructed, in, 1975, to, meet, the, growing, need, for, environmental, education, and, as, a, supplement, to, the, park, s, walking, track, system, the, park, is, intensely, used, for, environmental, education, by, schools, tafes, universities, and, other, groups, the, park, has, been, burnt, in, bushfires, on, several, occasions, most, notably, in, 1939, 1994, and, in, the, 2001, black, christmas, fires, australian, native, bush, naturally, regenerates, after, bushfires, and, as, of, 2008, few, signs, of, these, fires, remain, visible, in, times, of, extreme, fire, danger, the, parks, service, might, close, the, park, to, ensure, visitor, safety, there, are, camping, sites, at, bonnie, vale, north, era, and, uloola, falls, these, are, the, only, places, where, camping, is, permitted, within, the, park, and, they, are, regulated, with, a, booking, registration, system, which, requires, pre, booking, a, site, the, park, charges, a, vehicle, access, fee, but, is, free, for, people, on, foot, royal, national, park, contains, a, wide, variety, of, terrain, roughly, landscapes, in, the, park, vary, from, coastal, cliffs, broken, by, beaches, and, small, inlets, to, an, ancient, high, plateau, broken, by, extensive, and, deep, river, valleys, the, river, valleys, drain, from, south, to, north, where, they, run, into, port, hacking, the, extensive, but, generally, shallow, harbor, inlet, which, forms, the, northern, border, of, the, park, when, looking, across, the, park, from, east, to, west, or, vice, versa, the, rugged, folds, of, valley, after, valley, fade, into, the, distance, the, geology, of, the, site, consists, mostly, of, the, triassic, hawkesbury, sandstone, with, some, sections, of, the, park, having, the, more, recent, richer, wianamatta, shale, capping, deep, below, the, hawkesbury, sandstone, belt, lies, narrabeen, shales, which, is, mixture, of, shale, and, sandstone, under, which, and, within, which, are, untapped, coal, seams, which, run, right, through, sydney, and, are, mined, extensively, where, they, come, closer, to, the, surface, south, of, the, national, park, near, wollongong, sections, of, recent, alluvium, fringes, of, estuarine, watercourse, where, the, endangered, ecological, communities, swamp, oak, woodlands, and, swamp, mahogany, woodlands, grow, still, running, the, full, coastal, length, of, the, park, is, a, coastal, heathland, characterised, by, hardy, low, growing, salt, tolerant, shrubs, that, spread, across, rocky, hard, terrain, with, very, little, topsoil, the, coast, itself, is, composed, mostly, of, high, cliffs, reaching, a, height, of, nearly, one, hundred, metres, at, the, southern, end, these, cliffs, are, punctuated, by, a, number, of, fine, sandy, beaches, open, to, the, ocean, and, providing, fine, swimming, and, surfing, several, of, the, beaches, can, be, reached, by, road, others, only, by, several, hours, of, bush, walking, there, are, a, small, number, of, rocky, coves, the, beaches, two, of, which, have, volunteer, surf, life, saving, clubs, and, large, car, parks, are, amongst, the, most, visited, areas, of, the, park, these, heath, lands, are, a, hotspot, for, many, small, birds, that, have, forsaken, the, suburbs, of, sydney, such, as, the, new, holland, honeyeater, common, vegetation, on, the, exposed, heaths, on, the, headlands, and, cliffside, paths, include, coastal, rosemary, darwinia, bracelet, honey, myrtle, she, oak, white, kunzea, sundew, grass, trees, ridged, heath, myrtle, snakehood, orchids, prostrate, forms, of, coast, banksia, and, long, leaf, matrush, common, vegetation, on, top, of, the, ancient, sand, dunes, above, the, coastal, path, includes, silver, banksia, banksia, marginata, scrub, oak, allocasuarina, distyla, silky, hakea, hakea, sericea, and, pine, heath, astroloma, pinifolium, sections, of, rare, and, threatened, clifftop, grasslands, occur, along, exposed, and, windy, sites, which, are, generally, dominated, by, long, leaf, mat, rush, and, kangaroo, grass, themeda, australis, many, heath, specialist, birds, are, present, in, the, heaths, which, include, lewin, s, honeyeater, meliphaga, lewinii, new, holland, honeyeater, phylidonyris, novaehollandiae, beautiful, firetail, stagonopleura, bella, chestnut, rumped, heathwren, hylacola, pyrrhopygia, and, the, southern, emu, wren, in, royal, national, park, littoral, rainforest, often, the, first, type, of, vegetation, destroyed, during, coastal, development, has, survived, the, ravages, that, occurred, elsewhere, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, an, example, of, this, vegetation, occurs, in, the, southern, stretch, of, the, coast, walk, often, referred, to, as, the, palm, jungle, and, includes, a, typical, tuckeroo, cupaniopsis, anacardioides, forest, under, grown, by, coastal, tea, tree, leptospermum, laevigatum, and, long, leaf, matrush, lomandra, longifolia, moving, farther, inland, the, terrain, rises, to, a, series, of, very, rocky, ridges, and, plateaus, characterized, by, hardy, low, growing, shrubs, and, very, poor, rocky, soil, these, ridges, are, the, remnants, of, an, ancient, much, larger, plateau, that, has, been, deeply, eroded, into, an, extensive, series, of, river, valleys, this, specific, ridge, land, habitat, is, particularly, significant, for, sydney, as, most, similar, habitat, was, left, unprotected, and, was, subsequently, destroyed, to, make, way, for, cheap, development, which, has, made, many, species, only, found, ridges, threatened, with, extinction, due, to, extreme, habitat, clearance, fragmentation, soils, on, plateau, land, are, often, up, to, 2m, deep, and, consist, of, on, sandstone, ridges, sandy, podsol, interspersed, with, pockets, of, clay, derived, clay, ridges, and, plateaus, also, have, deep, soils, but, are, far, rarer, due, to, lack, of, representation, in, the, park, on, these, sites, the, soil, is, derived, from, wianamatta, clay, and, is, considered, rich, land, producing, good, quality, forest, on, the, sides, of, the, steep, river, valleys, that, punctuate, the, uplands, the, terrain, changes, to, exposed, rock, with, collected, pockets, of, soil, although, still, fairly, rocky, a, large, number, of, eucalyptus, and, other, tree, species, are, prevalent, small, streams, are, to, be, found, reasonably, frequently, and, understory, plants, cohabitate, with, the, larger, trees, although, the, terrain, is, still, fairly, open, and, easy, to, move, through, tree, heights, in, this, area, reach, an, average, maximum, of, about, ten, metres, the, plant, mix, and, geography, conditions, in, this, area, are, typical, of, much, of, the, terrain, in, the, coastal, areas, of, new, south, wales, but, with, many, widespread, genera, having, highly, localized, species, in, the, royal, national, park, this, sort, of, habitat, is, one, of, the, most, floristically, diverse, in, sydney, basin, this, environment, is, classed, as, sclerophyll, open, forest, and, is, divided, into, dry, and, wet, sclerophyll, forest, factors, that, shape, this, habitat, are, primarily, bushfires, low, phosphorus, nitrogen, levels, intense, summer, heat, and, low, water, levels, resulting, in, a, diverse, floristic, assembly, of, flora, and, fauna, with, apparently, divergent, paths, in, similar, habitats, for, example, scribbly, gums, eucalyptus, racemosa, sclerophylla, haemastoma, have, smooth, barked, trees, in, a, manner, which, reduces, their, chance, of, catching, on, fire, while, stringy, barks, eucalyptus, sp, have, bark, which, easily, catches, alight, clearing, the, way, for, its, fire, stimulated, seedlings, commonly,
