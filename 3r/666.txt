silicon, valley, is, a, region, in, northern, california, that, is, a, global, center, for, high, technology, and, innovation, located, in, the, southern, part, of, the, san, francisco, bay, area, it, corresponds, roughly, to, the, geographical, area, of, the, santa, clara, valley, the, term, silicon, valley, refers, to, the, area, in, which, high, tech, business, has, proliferated, in, northern, california, and, it, also, serves, as, a, general, metonym, for, california, s, high, tech, business, sector, the, cities, of, sunnyvale, mountain, view, palo, alto, and, menlo, park, are, frequently, cited, as, the, birthplace, of, silicon, valley, san, jose, is, silicon, valley, s, largest, city, the, third, largest, in, california, and, the, 13th, most, populous, in, the, united, states, other, major, silicon, valley, cities, include, santa, clara, redwood, city, and, cupertino, the, san, jose, metropolitan, area, has, the, third, highest, gdp, per, capita, in, the, world, after, z, rich, switzerland, and, oslo, norway, according, to, the, brookings, institution, as, of, june, 2021, it, also, had, the, highest, percentage, of, homes, valued, at, 1, million, or, more, in, the, united, states, silicon, valley, is, home, to, many, of, the, world, s, largest, high, tech, corporations, including, the, headquarters, of, more, than, 30, businesses, in, the, fortune, 1000, and, thousands, of, startup, companies, silicon, valley, also, accounts, for, one, third, of, all, of, the, venture, capital, investment, in, the, united, states, which, has, helped, it, to, become, a, leading, hub, and, startup, ecosystem, for, high, tech, innovation, although, the, tech, ecosystem, has, recently, become, more, geographically, dispersed, it, was, in, silicon, valley, that, the, silicon, based, integrated, circuit, the, microprocessor, and, the, microcomputer, among, other, technologies, were, developed, as, of, 2021, the, region, employed, about, a, half, million, information, technology, workers, as, more, high, tech, companies, were, established, across, san, jose, and, the, santa, clara, valley, and, then, north, towards, the, bay, area, s, two, other, major, cities, san, francisco, and, oakland, the, term, silicon, valley, came, to, have, two, definitions, a, narrower, geographic, one, referring, to, santa, clara, county, and, southeastern, san, mateo, county, and, a, metonymical, definition, referring, to, high, tech, businesses, in, the, entire, bay, area, the, term, silicon, valley, is, often, used, as, a, synecdoche, for, the, american, high, technology, economic, sector, the, name, also, became, a, global, synonym, for, leading, high, tech, research, and, enterprises, and, thus, inspired, similarly, named, locations, as, well, as, research, parks, and, technology, centers, with, comparable, structures, all, around, the, world, many, headquarters, of, tech, companies, in, silicon, valley, have, become, hotspots, for, tourism, silicon, refers, to, the, chemical, element, used, in, silicon, based, transistors, and, integrated, circuit, chips, which, is, the, focus, of, a, large, number, of, computer, hardware, and, software, innovators, and, manufacturers, in, the, region, the, popularization, of, the, name, is, often, credited, to, don, hoefler, the, first, journalist, to, use, the, term, in, a, news, story, his, article, silicon, valley, u, s, a, was, published, in, the, january, 11, 1971, issue, of, the, weekly, trade, newspaper, electronic, news, in, preparation, for, this, report, during, a, lunch, meeting, with, marketing, people, who, were, visiting, the, area, he, heard, them, use, the, term, earlier, uses, outside, journalism, exist, for, example, a, may, 1970, advertisement, in, the, peninsula, times, tribune, described, a, palo, alto, company, that, helps, production, people, in, silicon, valley, however, the, term, did, not, gain, widespread, use, until, the, early, 1980s, at, the, time, of, the, introduction, of, the, ibm, pc, and, numerous, related, hardware, and, software, products, to, the, consumer, market, the, urbanized, area, is, built, upon, an, alluvial, plain, within, a, longitudinal, valley, formed, by, roughly, parallel, earthquake, faults, the, area, between, the, faults, subsided, into, a, graben, or, dropped, valley, hoefler, defined, silicon, valley, as, the, urbanized, parts, of, the, san, francisco, peninsula, and, santa, clara, valley, before, the, expansive, growth, of, the, tech, industry, the, region, had, been, the, largest, fruit, producing, and, packing, region, in, the, world, up, through, the, 1960s, with, 39, fruit, canneries, the, nickname, it, had, been, known, as, during, that, period, was, the, valley, of, heart, s, delight, silicon, valley, was, born, through, the, intersection, of, several, contributing, factors, including, a, skilled, science, research, base, housed, in, area, universities, plentiful, venture, capital, permissive, government, regulation, and, steady, u, s, department, of, defense, spending, stanford, university, s, leadership, was, especially, important, in, the, valley, s, early, development, together, these, elements, formed, the, basis, of, its, growth, and, success, the, united, states, was, more, friendly, than, other, countries, to, business, investment, charging, much, lower, taxes, on, capital, gains, since, the, revenue, act, of, 1921, and, featuring, particularly, loose, free, market, controls, over, new, business, in, 1953, the, small, business, administration, was, created, to, foster, startups, giving, a, boost, to, entrepreneurs, northern, california, was, even, more, welcoming, with, a, group, of, venture, capitalists, actively, seeking, high, tech, business, ideas, clustered, on, sand, hill, road, in, menlo, park, and, palo, alto, california, s, civil, code, undermined, the, usual, non, compete, clauses, that, effectively, tied, employees, to, their, companies, in, other, states, allowing, california, workers, to, freely, apply, the, knowledge, they, gained, from, their, previous, employer, this, gave, silicon, valley, an, advantage, over, other, american, tech, hubs, such, as, massachusetts, route, 128, curving, around, boston, the, san, francisco, bay, area, had, long, been, a, major, site, of, united, states, navy, research, and, technology, in, 1909, charles, herrold, started, the, first, radio, station, in, the, united, states, with, regularly, scheduled, programming, in, san, jose, later, that, year, stanford, university, graduate, cyril, elwell, purchased, the, u, s, patents, for, poulsen, arc, radio, transmission, technology, and, founded, the, federal, telegraph, corporation, ftc, in, palo, alto, over, the, next, decade, the, ftc, created, the, world, s, first, global, radio, communication, system, and, signed, a, contract, with, the, navy, in, 1912, in, 1933, air, base, sunnyvale, california, was, commissioned, by, the, united, states, government, for, use, as, a, naval, air, station, nas, to, house, the, airship, uss, macon, in, hangar, one, the, station, was, renamed, nas, moffett, field, and, between, 1933, and, 1947, u, s, navy, blimps, were, based, there, a, number, of, technology, firms, had, set, up, shop, in, the, area, around, moffett, field, to, serve, the, navy, when, the, navy, gave, up, its, airship, ambitions, and, moved, most, of, its, west, coast, operations, to, san, diego, the, national, advisory, committee, for, aeronautics, naca, forerunner, of, nasa, took, over, portions, of, moffett, field, for, aeronautics, research, many, of, the, original, companies, stayed, while, new, ones, moved, in, the, immediate, area, was, soon, filled, with, aerospace, firms, such, as, lockheed, which, was, the, area, s, largest, employer, from, the, 1950s, into, 1980s, stanford, university, its, affiliates, and, graduates, have, played, a, major, role, in, the, development, of, the, culture, of, collaboration, among, high, tech, companies, a, powerful, sense, of, regional, solidarity, shaped, the, outlook, of, inventors, and, engineers, in, california, contrasting, markedly, from, the, insular, and, competitive, environment, of, engineering, firms, on, the, east, coast, of, the, united, states, from, the, 1890s, stanford, university, s, leaders, saw, its, mission, as, service, to, the, american, west, and, shaped, the, school, accordingly, at, the, same, time, the, perceived, exploitation, of, the, west, at, the, hands, of, eastern, interests, fueled, booster, like, attempts, to, build, self, sufficient, local, industry, thus, regionalism, helped, align, stanford, s, interests, with, those, of, the, area, s, high, tech, firms, frederick, terman, as, stanford, university, s, dean, of, the, school, of, engineering, from, 1946, encouraged, faculty, and, graduates, to, start, their, own, companies, in, 1951, terman, spearheaded, the, formation, of, stanford, industrial, park, now, stanford, research, park, an, area, surrounding, page, mill, road, south, west, of, el, camino, real, and, extending, beyond, foothill, expressway, to, arastradero, road, where, the, university, leased, portions, of, its, land, to, high, tech, firms, terman, nurtured, companies, like, hewlett, packard, varian, associates, eastman, kodak, general, electric, lockheed, corporation, and, other, high, tech, firms, until, what, would, become, silicon, valley, grew, up, around, the, stanford, university, campus, in, 1951, to, address, the, financial, demands, of, stanford, s, growth, requirements, and, to, provide, local, employment, opportunities, for, graduating, students, frederick, terman, proposed, leasing, stanford, s, lands, for, use, as, an, office, park, named, the, stanford, industrial, park, later, stanford, research, park, terman, invited, only, high, technology, companies, the, first, tenant, was, varian, associates, founded, by, stanford, alumni, in, the, 1930s, to, build, military, radar, components, terman, also, found, venture, capital, for, civilian, technology, start, ups, hewlett, packard, became, one, of, the, major, success, stories, founded, in, 1939, in, packard, s, garage, by, stanford, graduates, bill, hewlett, and, david, packard, hewlett, packard, moved, its, offices, into, the, stanford, research, park, shortly, after, 1953, in, 1954, stanford, originated, the, honors, cooperative, program, to, allow, full, time, employees, of, the, companies, to, pursue, graduate, degrees, from, the, university, on, a, part, time, basis, the, initial, companies, signed, five, year, agreements, in, which, they, would, pay, double, the, tuition, for, each, student, in, order, to, cover, the, costs, hewlett, packard, has, become, the, largest, personal, computer, manufacturer, in, the, world, and, transformed, the, home, printing, market, when, it, released, the, first, thermal, drop, on, demand, ink, jet, printer, in, 1984, other, early, tenants, included, eastman, kodak, general, electric, and, lockheed, in, 1956, william, shockley, the, co, inventor, of, the, first, working, transistor, with, john, bardeen, and, walter, houser, brattain, moved, from, new, jersey, to, mountain, view, california, to, start, shockley, semiconductor, laboratory, to, live, closer, to, his, ailing, mother, in, palo, alto, shockley, s, work, served, as, the, basis, for, many, electronic, developments, for, decades, both, frederick, terman, and, william, shockley, are, often, called, the, father, of, silicon, valley, unlike, many, other, researchers, who, used, germanium, as, the, semiconductor, material, shockley, believed, that, silicon, was, the, better, material, for, making, transistors, shockley, intended, to, replace, the, current, transistor, with, a, new, three, element, design, today, known, as, the, shockley, diode, but, the, design, was, considerably, more, difficult, to, build, than, the, simple, transistor, in, 1957, shockley, decided, to, end, research, on, the, silicon, transistor, as, a, result, of, shockley, s, abusive, management, style, eight, engineers, left, the, company, to, form, fairchild, semiconductor, shockley, referred, to, them, as, the, traitorous, eight, two, of, the, original, employees, of, fairchild, semiconductor, robert, noyce, and, gordon, moore, would, go, on, to, found, intel, following, the, 1959, inventions, of, the, monolithic, integrated, circuit, ic, chip, by, robert, noyce, at, fairchild, the, first, commercial, mos, ic, was, introduced, by, general, microelectronics, in, 1964, the, first, single, chip, microprocessor, was, the, intel, 4004, designed, and, realized, by, federico, faggin, along, with, ted, hoff, masatoshi, shima, and, stanley, mazor, at, intel, in, 1971, in, april, 1974, intel, released, the, intel, 8080, the, second, 8, bit, microprocessor, designed, and, manufactured, by, intel, on, april, 23, 1963, j, c, r, licklider, the, first, director, of, the, information, processing, techniques, office, ipto, at, the, pentagon, s, arpa, issued, an, office, memorandum, addressed, to, members, and, affiliates, of, the, intergalactic, computer, network, it, rescheduled, a, meeting, in, palo, alto, regarding, his, vision, of, a, computer, network, which, he, imagined, as, an, electronic, commons, open, to, all, the, main, and, essential, medium, of, informational, interaction, for, governments, institutions, corporations, and, individuals, as, head, of, ipto, from, 1962, to, 1964, licklider, initiated, three, of, the, most, important, developments, in, information, technology, the, creation, of, computer, science, departments, at, several, major, universities, time, sharing, and, networking, in, 1969, the, stanford, research, institute, now, sri, international, operated, one, of, the, four, original, nodes, that, comprised, arpanet, predecessor, to, the, internet, by, the, early, 1970s, there, were, many, semiconductor, companies, in, the, area, computer, firms, using, their, devices, and, programming, and, service, companies, serving, both, industrial, space, was, plentiful, and, housing, was, still, inexpensive, growth, during, this, era, was, fueled, by, the, emergence, of, venture, capital, on, sand, hill, road, beginning, with, kleiner, perkins, and, sequoia, capital, in, 1972, the, availability, of, venture, capital, exploded, after, the, successful, 1, 3, billion, ipo, of, apple, computer, in, december, 1980, since, the, 1980s, silicon, valley, has, been, home, to, the, largest, concentration, of, venture, capital, firms, in, the, world, in, 1971, don, hoefler, traced, the, origins, of, silicon, valley, firms, including, via, investments, from, fairchild, s, eight, co, founders, the, key, investors, in, kleiner, perkins, and, sequoia, capital, were, from, the, same, group, directly, leading, to, tech, crunch, 2014, estimate, of, 92, public, firms, of, 130, related, listed, firms, then, worth, over, us, 2, 1, trillion, with, over, 2, 000, firms, traced, back, to, them, another, important, pillar, of, the, valley, s, success, was, silicon, valley, bank, svb, founded, in, 1983, by, a, group, of, former, bank, of, america, executives, before, its, 2023, collapse, svb, specialized, in, providing, banking, services, to, silicon, valley, entrepreneurs, and, their, startup, firms, svb, s, original, primary, commercial, lending, product, was, a, working, capital, line, of, credit, secured, by, a, startup, s, accounts, receivable, in, contrast, to, traditional, banks, who, focused, their, commercial, lending, on, already, established, businesses, svb, specialized, in, lending, money, to, small, startup, companies, in, the, preprofit, stage, prior, to, 1970, most, northern, california, lawyers, were, based, in, san, francisco, especially, the, experienced, patent, attorneys, whom, the, high, tech, industry, needed, to, protect, its, intellectual, property, during, the, 1970s, lawyers, began, to, follow, venture, capitalists, down, the, peninsula, to, serve, the, booming, high, tech, industry, in, silicon, valley, as, of, 1999, there, were, 2, 400, lawyers, practicing, law, in, palo, alto, a, city, of, only, 50, 000, people, the, densest, concentration, of, lawyers, in, the, united, states, outside, of, washington, d, c, by, the, year, 2000, large, law, firms, from, all, over, the, world, were, rushing, to, establish, offices, in, the, mid, peninsula, region, on, or, near, sand, hill, road, and, silicon, valley, law, firms, had, become, global, trendsetters, in, that, they, were, the, first, legal, services, employers, to, adopt, business, casual, apparel, in, imitation, of, their, startup, clients, during, this, era, lawyers, evolved, from, their, relatively, narrow, conventional, role, as, protectors, of, intellectual, property, into, business, advisers, intermediaries, and, dealmakers, and, thereby, acquired, great, prominence, in, silicon, valley, for, young, entrepreneurs, new, to, the, valley, s, mysterious, ways, their, lawyer, often, served, as, their, first, coach, mentor, teacher, friend, and, cheerleader, who, helped, connect, them, to, the, valley, s, startup, ecosystem, as, of, 2022, the, san, jose, sunnyvale, santa, clara, metropolitan, area, had, the, highest, average, wage, for, lawyers, in, the, united, states, at, 267, 840, the, homebrew, computer, club, was, an, informal, group, of, electronic, enthusiasts, and, technically, minded, hobbyists, who, gathered, to, trade, parts, circuits, and, information, pertaining, to, diy, construction, of, computing, devices, it, was, started, by, gordon, french, and, fred, moore, who, met, at, the, community, computer, center, in, menlo, park, they, both, were, interested, in, maintaining, a, regular, open, forum, for, people, to, get, together, to, work, on, making, computers, more, accessible, to, everyone, the, first, meeting, was, held, as, of, march, 1975, at, french, s, garage, in, menlo, park, san, mateo, county, california, which, was, on, occasion, of, the, arrival, of, the, mits, altair, microcomputer, the, first, unit, sent, to, the, area, for, review, by, people, s, computer, company, steve, wozniak, and, steve, jobs, credit, that, first, meeting, with, inspiring, them, to, design, the, original, apple, i, and, successor, apple, ii, computers, as, a, result, the, first, preview, of, the, apple, i, was, given, at, the, homebrew, computer, club, subsequent, meetings, were, held, at, an, auditorium, at, the, stanford, linear, accelerator, center, although, semiconductors, are, still, a, major, component, of, the, area, s, economy, silicon, valley, has, been, most, famous, in, recent, years, for, innovations, in, software, and, internet, services, silicon, valley, has, significantly, influenced, computer, operating, systems, software, and, user, interfaces, using, money, from, nasa, the, us, air, force, and, arpa, douglas, engelbart, invented, the, mouse, and, hypertext, based, collaboration, tools, in, the, mid, 1960s, and, 1970s, while, at, stanford, research, institute, now, sri, international, first, publicly, demonstrated, in, 1968, in, what, is, now, known, as, the, mother, of, all, demos, engelbart, s, augmentation, research, center, at, sri, was, also, involved, in, launching, the, arpanet, precursor, to, the, internet, and, starting, the, network, information, center, now, internic, xerox, hired, some, of, engelbart, s, best, researchers, beginning, in, the, early, 1970s, in, turn, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, xerox, s, palo, alto, research, center, parc, played, a, pivotal, role, in, object, oriented, programming, graphical, user, interfaces, guis, ethernet, postscript, and, laser, printers, while, xerox, marketed, equipment, using, its, technologies, for, the, most, part, its, technologies, flourished, elsewhere, the, diaspora, of, xerox, inventions, led, directly, to, 3com, and, adobe, systems, and, indirectly, to, cisco, apple, computer, and, microsoft, apple, s, macintosh, gui, was, largely, a, result, of, steve, jobs, visit, to, parc, and, the, subsequent, hiring, of, key, personnel, cisco, s, impetus, stemmed, from, the, need, to, route, a, variety, of, protocols, over, stanford, university, s, ethernet, campus, network, commercial, use, of, the, internet, became, practical, and, grew, slowly, throughout, the, early, 1990s, in, 1995, commercial, use, of, the, internet, grew, substantially, and, the, initial, wave, of, internet, startups, amazon, com, ebay, and, the, predecessor, to, craigslist, began, operations, silicon, valley, is, generally, considered, to, have, been, the, center, of, the, dot, com, bubble, which, started, in, the, mid, 1990s, and, collapsed, after, the, nasdaq, stock, market, began, to, decline, dramatically, in, april, 2000, during, the, bubble, era, real, estate, prices, reached, unprecedented, levels, for, a, brief, time, sand, hill, road, was, home, to, the, most, expensive, commercial, real, estate, in, the, world, and, the, booming, economy, resulted, in, severe, traffic, congestion, the, paypal, mafia, is, sometimes, credited, with, inspiring, the, re, emergence, of, consumer, focused, internet, companies, after, the, dot, com, bust, of, 2001, after, the, dot, com, crash, silicon, valley, continues, to, maintain, its, status, as, one, of, the, top, research, and, development, centers, in, the, world, a, 2006, the, wall, street, journal, story, found, that, 12, of, the, 20, most, inventive, towns, in, america, were, in, california, and, 10, of, those, were, in, silicon, valley, san, jose, led, the, list, with, 3, 867, utility, patents, filed, in, 2005, and, number, two, was, sunnyvale, at, 1, 881, utility, patents, silicon, valley, is, also, home, to, a, significant, number, of, unicorn, ventures, referring, to, startup, companies, whose, valuation, has, exceeded, 1, billion, dollars, the, san, francisco, bay, area, has, the, largest, concentration, of, high, tech, companies, in, the, united, states, at, 387, 000, high, tech, jobs, of, which, silicon, valley, accounts, for, 225, 300, high, tech, jobs, silicon, valley, has, the, highest, concentration, of, high, tech, workers, of, any, metropolitan, area, with, 285, 9, out, of, every, 1, 000, private, sector, workers, silicon, valley, has, the, highest, average, high, tech, salary, in, the, united, states, at, 144, 800, largely, a, result, of, the, high, technology, sector, the, san, jose, sunnyvale, santa, clara, ca, metropolitan, statistical, area, has, the, most, millionaires, and, the, most, billionaires, in, the, united, states, per, capita, over, time, however, the, venture, capital, ecosystem, is, growing, more, geographically, decentralized, the, region, is, the, biggest, high, tech, manufacturing, center, in, the, united, states, the, unemployment, rate, of, the, region, was, 9, 4, in, january, 2009, and, has, decreased, to, a, record, low, of, 2, 7, as, of, august, 2019, silicon, valley, received, 41, of, all, u, s, venture, investment, in, 2011, and, 46, in, 2012, during, the, period, from, 2019, to, 2021, silicon, valley, s, share, of, u, s, venture, capital, investment, dropped, to, 35, 9, but, had, surged, back, to, 41, as, of, the, first, quarter, of, 2023, more, traditional, industries, also, recognize, the, potential, of, high, tech, development, and, several, car, manufacturers, have, opened, offices, in, silicon, valley, to, capitalize, on, its, entrepreneurial, ecosystem, manufacture, of, transistors, was, for, a, long, time, the, core, industry, in, silicon, valley, the, workforce, was, for, the, most, part, composed, of, asian, and, latino, immigrants, who, were, paid, low, wages, and, worked, in, hazardous, conditions, due, to, the, chemicals, used, in, the, manufacture, of, integrated, circuits, technical, engineering, design, and, administrative, staffs, were, in, large, part, well, compensated, silicon, valley, has, a, severe, housing, shortage, caused, by, the, market, imbalance, between, jobs, created, and, housing, units, built, from, 2010, to, 2015, many, more, jobs, have, been, created, than, housing, units, built, 400, 000, jobs, 60, 000, housing, units, this, shortage, has, driven, home, prices, extremely, high, far, out, of, the, range, of, production, workers, as, of, 2016, a, two, bedroom, apartment, rented, for, about, 2, 500, while, the, median, home, price, was, about, 1, million, the, financial, post, called, silicon, valley, the, most, expensive, u, s, housing, region, homelessness, is, a, problem, with, housing, beyond, the, reach, of, middle, income, residents, there, is, little, shelter, space, other, than, in, san, jose, which, as, of, 2015, was, making, an, effort, to, develop, shelters, by, renovating, old, hotels, the, economist, also, attributes, the, high, cost, of, living, to, the, success, of, the, industries, in, this, region, although, this, rift, between, high, and, low, salaries, is, driving, many, residents, out, who, can, no, longer, afford, to, live, there, in, the, bay, area, the, number, of, residents, planning, to, leave, within, the, next, several, years, has, had, an, increase, of, 35, since, 2016, from, 34, to, 46, the, wealth, inequality, in, silicon, valley, is, more, pronounced, than, in, any, other, region, of, the, united, states, a, 2023, report, found, that, the, aggregate,
