spelling, of, gilberts, in, the, gilbertese, language, as, kiribati, may, be, found, in, books, in, gilbertese, prepared, by, missionaries, but, with, the, meaning, of, gilbertese, demonym, and, language, see, e, g, hawaiian, board, of, missionaries, 1895, the, first, mention, as, a, dictionary, entry, of, the, word, kiribati, as, the, native, name, of, the, country, was, written, down, in, 1952, by, ernest, sabatier, in, his, comprehensive, dictionnaire, gilbertin, fran, ais, the, indigenous, name, often, suggested, for, the, gilbert, islands, proper, is, tungaru, see, e, g, ernest,

some, polynesian, and, melanesian, cultural, aspects, respectively, intermarriage, and, intense, navigation, between, the, islands, tended, to, blur, cultural, differences, and, resulted, in, a, significant, degree, of, cultural, homogenization, local, oral, historians, chiefly, in, the, form, of, lore, keepers, suggest, that, the, area, was, first, inhabited, by, a, group, of, seafaring, people, from, melanesia, who, were, described, as, being, dark, skinned, frizzy, haired, and, short, in, stature, these, indigenous, peoples, were, then, visited, by, early, austronesian, seafarers, from, the, west, a, place, called, matang, orally, described, as, being, tall, and, fair, skinned, eventually, both, groups, intermittently, clashed, and, intermingled, until, they, slowly, became, a, uniform, population, around, 1300, ce, a, mass, departure, occurred, from, samoa, leading, to, the, addition, of, polynesian, ancestry, into, the, mix, of, most, gilbertese, people, these, samoans, later, brought, strong, features, of, polynesian, languages, and, culture, creating, clans, based, on, their, own, samoan, traditions, and, slowly, intertwining, with, the, indigenous, clans, and, powers, already, dominant, in, kiribati, around, the, 15th, century, starkly, contrasting, systems, of, governance, arose, between, the, northern, islands, primarily, under, chiefly, rule, uea, and,

years, or, even, decades, before, the, turmoil, lasted, well, into, the, european, visitation, and, colonial, era, which, led, to, certain, islands, decimating, their, foes, with, the, help, of, guns, and, cannon, equipped, ships, that, europeans, provided, to, some, i, kiribati, leaders, the, typical, military, arms, of, the, i, kiribati, at, this, time, were, shark, tooth, embedded, wooden, spears, knives, and, swords, and, garbs, of, armour, fashioned, from, dense, coconut, fibre, they, chiefly, used, these, instead, of, the, gunpowder, and, weapons, of, steel, available, at, the, time, because, of, the, strong, sentimental, value, of, the, equipment, handed, down, through, generations, ranged, weapons, such, as, bows, slings, and, javelins, were, seldom, used, hand, to, hand,

intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, predicts, that, sea, levels, will, rise, by, about, 50, cm, 20, in, by, 2100, due, to, global, warming, and, a, further, rise, would, be, inevitable, it, is, thus, likely, that, within, a, century, the, nation, s, arable, land, will, become, subject, to, increased, soil, salination, and, will, be, largely, submerged, the, exposure, of, kiribati, to, changes, in, sea, levels, is, exacerbated, by, the, pacific, decadal, oscillation, which, is, a, climate, switch, phenomenon, that, results, in, changes, from, periods, of, la, ni, a, to, periods, of, el, ni, o, this, has, an, effect, on, sea, levels, for, example, in, 2000, there, was, a, switch, from, periods, of, downward, pressure, of, el, ni, o, on, sea, levels, to, an, upward, pressure, of, la, ni, a, on, sea, levels, which, upward, pressure, causes, more, frequent, and, higher, high, tide, levels, the, perigean, spring, tide, often, called, a, king, tide, can, result, in, seawater, flooding, low, lying, areas, of, the, islands, of, kiribati, the, atolls, and, reef, islands, can, respond, to, changes, in, sea, level, paul, kench, at, the, university, of, auckland, in, new, zealand, and, arthur, webb, at, the, south, pacific, applied, geoscience, commission, in, fiji, released, a, study, in, 2010, on, the, dynamic, response, of, atolls, and, reef, islands, in, the, central, pacific, kiribati, was, mentioned, in, the, study, and, webb, and, kench, found, that, the, three, major, urbanised, islands, in, kiribati, betio, bairiki, and, nanikai, increased, by, 30, 36, hectares, 16, 3, 5, 8, hectares, and, 12, 5, 0, 8, hectares, respectively, the, study, by, paul, kench, and, arthur, webb, recognises, that, the, islands, are, extremely, vulnerable, to, sea, level, rise, and, concluded, that, this, study, did, not, measure, vertical, growth, of, the, island, surface, nor, does, it, suggest, there, is, any, change, in, the, height, of, the, islands, since, land, height, has, not, changed, the, vulnerability, of, the, greater, part, of, the, land, area, of, each, island, to, submergence, due, to, sea, level, rise, is, also, unchanged, and, these, low, lying, atolls, remain, immediately, and, extremely, vulnerable, to, inundation, or, sea, water, flooding, the, climate, change, in, the, pacific, report, of, 2011, describes, kiribati, as, having, a, low, risk, of, cyclones, in, march, 2015, kiribati, experienced, flooding, and, destruction, of, seawalls, and, coastal, infrastructure, as, the, result, of, cyclone, pam, a, category, 5, cyclone, that, devastated, vanuatu, kiribati, remains, exposed, to, the, risk, that, cyclones, can, strip, the, low, lying, islands, of, their, vegetation, and, soil, gradual, sea, level, rise, also, allows, for, coral, polyp, activity, to, raise, the, atolls, with, the, sea, level, however, if, the, increase, in, sea, level, occurs, at, a, rate, faster, than, coral, growth, or, if, polyp, activity, is, damaged, by, ocean, acidification, then, the, resilience, of, the, atolls, and, reef, islands, is, less, certain, also, coral, bleaching, has, occurred, on, more, than, 60, of, the, coral, reefs, in, the, maldives, the, human, rights, measurement, initiative, finds, that, the, climate, crisis, has, worsened, human, rights, conditions, moderately, 4, 8, out, of, 6, in, kiribati, human, rights, experts, reported, that, the, climate, crisis, has, compromised, access, to, food, and, clean, water, as, well, as, women, s, rights, housing, security, and, cultural, integrity, the, kiribati, adaptation, program, kap, started, in, 2003, is, a, us, 5, 5, million, initiative, that, was, originally, enacted, by, the, national, government, of, kiribati, with, the, support, of, the, global, environment, facility, gef, the, world, bank, the, united, nations, development, program, and, the, japanese, government, australia, later, joined, the, coalition, donating, us, 1, 5, million, to, the, effort, the, program, aims, to, take, place, over, six, years, supporting, measures, that, reduce, kiribati, s, vulnerability, to, the, effects, of, climate, change, and, sea, level, rise, by, raising, awareness, of, climate, change, assessing, and, protecting, available, water, resources, and, managing, inundation, at, the, start, of, the, adaptation, program, representatives, from, each, of, the, inhabited, atolls, identified, key, climatic, changes, that, had, taken, place, over, the, past, 20, 40, years, and, proposed, coping, mechanisms, to, deal, with, these, changes, under, four, categories, of, urgency, of, need, the, program, is, now, focusing, on, the, country, s, most, vulnerable, sectors, in, the, most, highly, populated, areas, initiatives, include, improving, water, supply, management, in, and, around, tarawa, coastal, management, protection, measures, such, as, mangrove, re, plantation, and, protection, of, public, infrastructure, strengthening, laws, to, reduce, coastal, erosion, and, population, settlement, planning, to, reduce, personal, risks, the, government, has, taken, specific, action, to, ensure, food, security, as, sea, level, rise, drought, and, overfishing, have, created, food, and, water, shortages, this, has, involved, diversifying, food, sources, and, ensuring, existing, resources, are, managed, sustainably, the, issue, of, plastic, pollution, has, also, been, a, key, challenge, for, kiribati, as, it, hurts, both, its, marine, biodiversity, and, its, economy, that, relies, primarily, on, tourism, and, fishery, as, a, result, the, government, of, kiribati, more, specifically, the, environment, and, conservation, division, ecd, which, forms, part, of, the, kiribati, government, s, ministry, of, environment, lands, and, agricultural, development, has, made, efforts, to, tackle, this, issue, nationally, through, environment, acts, and, state, policy, papers, to, a, further, extent, it, has, also, recognized, the, global, nature, of, plastic, pollution, and, consequently, has, promoted, international, cooperation, and, multilateral, solutions, this, is, notably, observable, during, the, current, negotiations, of, the, global, plastic, pollution, treaty, planned, to, be, finally, drafted, by, the, end, of, 2024, kiribati, has, a, tropical, rainforest, climate, af, from, april, to, october, there, are, predominant, northeastern, winds, and, stable, temperatures, close, to, 30, c, 86, f, from, november, to, april, western, gales, bring, rain, the, kiribati, wet, season, te, auu, meang, also, known, as, the, tropical, cyclone, tc, te, angibuaka, season, starts, from, november, to, april, every, year, kiribati, therefore, typically, experiences, more, extreme, weather, events, associated, with, tropical, disturbances, or, tropical, cyclones, during, te, auu, meang, tropical, cyclones, rarely, develop, or, pass, along, the, equator, where, kiribati, is, located, but, kiribati, has, historically, been, impacted, by, distant, tropical, cyclones, the, impacts, were, observed, while, the, systems, were, still, in, their, development, stages, tropical, low, disturbance, or, even, before, they, reached, tropical, cyclone, category, the, fair, season, starts, when, ten, rimwimata, antares, appears, in, the, sky, after, sunset, from, may, to, november, when, more, gentle, winds, and, currents, and, less, rain, then, towards, december, when, nei, auti, pleiades, replaces, antares, the, season, of, sudden, westerly, winds, and, more, heavy, rain, discourages, any, far, travel, from, island, to, island, kiribati, does, not, experience, cyclones, but, effects, may, occasionally, be, experienced, during, cyclone, seasons, affecting, nearby, pacific, island, countries, such, as, fiji, precipitation, varies, significantly, between, islands, for, example, the, annual, average, is, 3, 000, mm, 120, in, in, the, north, and, 500, mm, 20, in, in, the, south, of, the, gilbert, islands, most, of, these, islands, are, in, the, dry, belt, of, the, equatorial, oceanic, climatic, zone, and, experience, prolonged, droughts, kiribati, contains, three, ecosystems, central, polynesian, tropical, moist, forests, eastern, micronesia, tropical, moist, forests, and, western, polynesian, tropical, moist, forests, because, of, the, relatively, young, geological, age, of, the, islands, and, atolls, and, the, high, level, of, soil, salination, the, flora, of, kiribati, is, somewhat, unhealthy, the, gilbert, islands, contain, about, 83, indigenous, and, 306, introduced, plants, whereas, the, corresponding, numbers, for, line, and, phoenix, islands, are, 67, and, 283, none, of, these, species, are, endemic, and, about, half, of, the, indigenous, ones, have, a, limited, distribution, and, have, become, endangered, or, nearly, extinct, due, to, human, activities, such, as, phosphate, mining, coconut, pandanus, palms, and, breadfruit, trees, are, the, most, common, wild, plants, whereas, the, five, most, cultivated, crops, but, the, traditional, babai, cyrtosperma, merkusii, are, imported, chinese, cabbage, pumpkin, tomato, watermelon, and, cucumber, over, eighty, percent, of, the, population, participates, in, either, farming, or, fishing, seaweed, farming, is, an, important, part, of, the, economy, with, two, major, species, eucheuma, alvarezii, and, eucheuma, spinosium, introduced, to, the, local, lagoons, from, the, philippines, in, 1977, it, competes, with, a, collection, of, the, black, lipped, pearl, oyster, pinctada, margaritifera, and, shellfish, which, are, dominated, by, the, strombid, gastropod, strombus, luhuanus, and, anadara, cockles, anadara, uropigimelana, whereas, the, stocks, of, the, giant, clam, tridacna, gigas, have, been, largely, exhausted, kiribati, has, a, few, land, mammals, none, being, indigenous, or, endemic, they, include, the, polynesian, rat, rattus, exulans, dogs, cats, and, pigs, among, the, 75, bird, species, the, bokikokiko, acrocephalus, aequinoctialis, is, endemic, to, kiritimati, there, are, 600, 800, species, of, inshore, and, pelagic, finfish, some, 200, species, of, corals, and, about, 1000, species, of, shellfish, fishing, mostly, targets, the, family, scombridae, particularly, the, skipjack, tuna, and, yellowfin, tuna, as, well, as, flying, fish, cypselurus, spp, dogs, were, already, accompanying, the, first, inhabitants, but, were, re, introduced, by, european, settlers, they, have, continued, to, grow, in, numbers, and, are, roaming, in, traditional, packs, particularly, around, south, tarawa, kiribati, has, few, natural, resources, commercially, viable, phosphate, deposits, on, banaba, were, exhausted, at, the, time, of, independence, copra, and, fish, now, represent, the, bulk, of, production, and, exports, kiribati, has, the, lowest, gdp, out, of, any, sovereign, state, in, oceania, and, is, considered, one, of, the, least, developed, countries, in, the, world, in, one, form, or, another, kiribati, gets, a, large, portion, of, its, income, from, abroad, examples, include, fishing, licences, development, assistance, workers, remittances,

period, in, may, 2011, the, imf, country, report, assessment, of, the, economy, of, kiribati, is, that, after, two, years, of, contraction, the, economy, recovered, in, the, second, half, of, 2010, and, inflation, pressure, dissipated, it, is, estimated, to, have, grown, by, 1, 75, for, the, year, despite, a, weather, related, drop, in, copra, production, private, sector, activity, appears, to, have, picked, up, especially, in, retail, tourist, arrivals, rebounded, by, 20, compared, to, 2009, although, from, a, very, low, base, despite, the, rise, in, world, food, and, fuel, prices, inflation, has, bounced, from, 2008, crisis, highs, into, negative, territory, reflecting, the, strong, appreciation, of, the, australian, dollar, which, is, used, as, the, domestic, currency, and, a,

people, of, kiribati, are, called, i, kiribati, ethnically, the, i, kiribati, are, oceanians, a, sub, ethnicity, of, austronesians, recent, archaeological, evidence, indicates, that, austronesians, originally, settled, the, islands, thousands, of, years, ago, around, the, 14th, century, fijians, samoans, and, tongans, invaded, the, islands, thus, diversifying, the, ethnic, range, and,

of, kiribati, speak, gilbertese, an, oceanic, language, english, is, the, other, official, language, but, is, not, used, very, often, outside, the, island, capital, of, tarawa, it, is, more, likely, that, some, english, words, are, mixed, in, their, use, with, gilbertese, older, generations, of, i, kiribati, tend, to, use, more, complicated, versions, of, the, language, several, words, in, gilbertese, have, been, adopted, from, european, settlers, for, instance, kamea, is, one, of, the, gilbertese, words, for, dog, kiri, being, the, oceanic, one, which, has, its, origins, in, the, i,

noise, kauniwae, shoes, the, cow, for, the, feet, christianity, is, the, major, religion, in, kiribati, having, been, lately, introduced, by, missionaries, because, of, its, remoteness, and, the,

considered, vulgar, within, the, context, of, kiribati, dancing, this, is, due, to, its, origin, of, not, being, solely, as, a, form, of, entertainment, but, as, a, form, of, storytelling, and, a, display, of, the, skill, beauty, and, endurance, of, the, dancer, traditionally, the, staple, diet, of, the, i, kiribati, was, the, abundance, of, seafood, and, coconuts, starch, based, carbohydrate, sources, were, not, plentiful, due, to, the, hostile, climate, of, the, atolls, with, only, the, northernmost, atolls, being, viable, for, constant, agriculture, the, national, crop, bwabwai, was,
