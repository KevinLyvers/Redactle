iberian, peninsula, in, the, west, to, the, russian, far, east, and, from, the, russian, far, north, to, maritime, southeast, asia, in, the, south, but, other, specific, geographical, limits, of,

many, ancient, civilizations, including, those, based, in, mesopotamia, the, indus, valley, and, china, in, the, axial, age, mid, first, millennium, bce, a, continuous, belt, of, civilizations, stretched, through, the, eurasian, subtropical, zone, from, the, atlantic, to, the, pacific, this, belt, became, the, mainstream, of, world, history, for, two, millennia, originally, eurasia, is, a, geographical, notion, in, this, sense, it, is, simply, the, biggest, continent, the, combined, landmass, of, europe, and, asia, however, geopolitically, the, word, has, several, meanings, reflecting, specific, geopolitical, interests, eurasia, is, one, of, the, most, important, geopolitical, concepts, and, it, figures, prominently, in, the, commentaries, on, the, ideas, of, halford, mackinder, as, zbigniew, brzezinski, observed, on, eurasia, how, america, manages, eurasia, is, critical, a, power, that, dominates, eurasia, would, control, two, of, the, world, s, three, most, advanced, and, economically, productive, regions, a, mere, glance, at, the, map, also, suggests, that, control, over, eurasia, would, almost, automatically, entail, africa, s, subordination, rendering, the, western, hemisphere, and, oceania, geopolitically, peripheral, to, the, world, s, central, continent, about, 75, per, cent, of, the, world, s, people, live, in, eurasia, and, most, of, the, world, s, physical, wealth, is, there, as, well, both, in, its, enterprises, and, underneath, its, soil, eurasia, accounts, for, about, three, fourths, of, the, world, s, known, energy, resources, the, russian, eurasianism, corresponded, initially, more, or, less, to, the, land, area, of, imperial, russia, in, 1914, including, parts, of, eastern, europe, one, of, russia, s, main, geopolitical, interests, lies, in, ever, closer, integration, with, those, countries, that, it, considers, part, of, eurasia, the, term, eurasia, gained, geopolitical, reputation, as, one, of, the, three, superstates, in, 1984, george, orwell, s, novel, where, constant, surveillance, and, propaganda, are, strategic, elements, introduced, as, reflexive, antagonists, of, the, heterogeneous, dispositif, such, metapolitical, constructs, used, to, control, and, exercise, power, across, eurasia, several, single, markets, have, emerged, including, the, eurasian, economic, space, european, single, market, asean, economic, community, and, the, gulf, cooperation, council, there, are, also, several, international, organizations, and, initiatives, which, seek, to, promote, integration, throughout, eurasia, including, in, ancient, times, the, greeks, classified, europe, derived, from, the, mythological, phoenician, princess, europa, and, asia, which, to, the, greeks, originally, included, africa, derived, from, asia, a, woman, in, greek, mythology, as, separate, lands, where, to, draw, the, dividing, line, between, the, two, regions, is, still, a, matter, of, discussion, especially, whether, the, kuma, manych, depression, or, the, caucasus, mountains, form, the, southeast, boundary, is, disputed, since, mount, elbrus, would, be, part, of, europe, in, the, latter, case, making, it, and, not, mont, blanc, europe, s, highest, mountain, most, accepted, is, probably, the, boundary, as, defined, by, philip, johan, von, strahlenberg, in, the, 18th, century, he, defined, the, dividing, line, along, the, aegean, sea, dardanelles, sea, of, marmara, bosporus, black, sea, kuma, manych, depression, caspian, sea, ural, river, and, the, ural, mountains, however, at, least, part, of, this, definition, has, been, subject, to, criticism, by, many, modern, analytical, geographers, like, halford, mackinder, who, saw, little, validity, in, the, ural, mountains, as, a, boundary, between, continents, nineteenth, century, russian, philosopher, nikolai, danilevsky, defined, eurasia, as, an, entity, separate, from, europe, and, asia, bounded, by, the, himalayas, the, caucasus, the, alps, the, arctic, the, pacific, the, atlantic, the, mediterranean, the, black, sea, and, the, caspian, sea, a, definition, that, has, been, influential, in, russia, and, other, parts, of, the, former, soviet, union, nowadays, partly, inspired, by, this, usage, the, term, eurasia, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, the, post, soviet, space, in, particular, russia, the, central, asian, republics, and, the, transcaucasus, republics, and, sometimes, also, adjacent, regions, such, as, turkey, and, mongolia, the, word, eurasia, is, often, used, in, kazakhstan, to, describe, its, location, numerous, kazakh, institutions, have, the, term, in, their, names, like, the, l, n, gumilev, eurasian, national, university, kazakh, lev, gumilev, s, eurasianism, ideas, having, been, popularized, in, kazakhstan, by, olzhas, suleimenov, the, eurasian, media, forum, the, eurasian, cultural, foundation, the, eurasian, development, bank, and, the, eurasian, bank, in, 2007, kazakhstan, s, president, nursultan, nazarbayev, proposed, building, a, eurasia, canal, to, connect, the, caspian, sea, and, the, black, sea, via, russia, s, kuma, manych, depression, to, provide, kazakhstan, and, other, caspian, basin, countries, with, a, more, efficient, path, to, the, ocean, than, the, existing, volga, don, canal, this, usage, can, also, be, seen, in, the, names, of, eurasianet, the, journal, of, eurasian, studies, and, the, association, for, slavic, east, european, and, eurasian, studies, as, well, as, the, titles, of, numerous, academic, programmes, at, us, universities, this, usage, is, comparable, to, how, americans, use, western, hemisphere, to, describe, concepts, and, organizations, dealing, with, the, americas, e, g, council, on, hemispheric, affairs, western, hemisphere, institute, for, security, cooperation, africa, antarctica, asia, australia, europe, north, america, south, america, afro, eurasia, americas, eurasia, oceania, 50, n, 80, e, 50, n, 80, e, 50, 80
