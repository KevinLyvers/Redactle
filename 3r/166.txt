million, km, 2, with, 65, of, it, in, venezuela, and, the, 35, in, colombia, it, is, the, fourth, largest, river, in, the, world, by, discharge, volume, of, water, the, nevertheless, high, volume, flow, 39, 000, m, 3, s, at, delta, of, the, orinoco, can, be, explained, by, the, high, precipitation, in, almost, the, entire, catchment, area, ca, 2, 300, mm, a, the, orinoco, river, and, its, tributaries, are, the, major, transportation, system, for, eastern, and, interior, venezuela, and, the, llanos, of, colombia, the, environment, and, wildlife, in, the, orinoco, s, basin, are,

the, mouth, of, the, orinoco, river, at, the, atlantic, ocean, was, documented, by, christopher, columbus, on, 1, august, 1498, during, his, third, voyage, its, source, at, the, cerro, delgado, chalbaud, in, the, parima, range, was, not, explored, until, 453, years, later, in, 1951, the, source, near, the, venezuelan, brazilian, border, at, 1, 047, metres, 3, 435, ft, above, sea, level, 2,

eastern, llanos, such, as, the, apure, and, meta, were, explored, in, the, 16th, century, by, german, expeditions, under, ambrosius, ehinger, and, his, successors, in, 1531, starting, at, the, principal, outlet, in, the, delta, the, boca, de, navios, diego, de, ordaz, sailed, up, the, river, to, the, meta, antonio, de, berrio, sailed, down, the, casanare, to, the, meta, and, then, down,

1951, by, the, french, venezuelan, expedition, that, went, back, and, explored, the, upper, orinoco, course, to, the, sierra, parima, near, the, border, with, brazil, headed, by, venezuelan, army, officer, frank, risquez, iribarren, the, first, bridge, across, the, orinoco, river, the, angostura, bridge, at, ciudad, bol, var, venezuela, was, completed, in, 1967, in, 1968, an, expedition, was, set, off, by, national, geographic, and, hovercraft, from, manaus, brazil, to, port, of, spain, trinidad, aboard, a, sr, n6, hovercraft, the, expedition, members, followed, the, negro, river, upstream, to, where, it, is, joined, by, the, casiquiare, canal, on, the, border, between, colombia, and, venezuela, after, following, the, casiquiare, to, the, orinoco, river, they, hovered, thru, perilous, rapids, of, the, rivers, maipures, and, atures, the, orinoco, was, then, traversed, down, to, its, mouths, in, the, gulf, of, paria, and, then, to, port, of, spain, the, primary, purpose, of, the, expedition, was, filming, for, the, bbc, series, the, world, about, us, episode, the, last, great, journey, on, earth, from, amazon, to, orinoco, by, hovercraft, which, aired, in, 1970, and, demonstrated, the, abilities, of, a, hovercraft, thereby, promoting, sales, of, this, british, invention, the, first, powerline, crossing, of, the, orinoco, river, was, completed, in, 1981, for, an, 800, kv, tl, single, span, of, 1, 200, metres, 3, 900, ft, using, two, towers, 110, metres, 360, ft, tall, in, 1992, an, overhead, power, line, crossing, for, two, 400, kv, circuits, was, completed, just, west, of, morocure, between, the, cities, of, ciudad, bol, var, and, ciudad, guayana, north, of, the, confluence, of, routes, 1, and, 19, it, had, three, towers, and, the, two, spans, measured, 2, 161, metres, 7, 090, ft, and, 2, 537, metres, 8, 323, ft, respectively, in, 2006, a, second, bridge, known, as, the, orinoquia, bridge, was, completed, near, ciudad, guayana, venezuela, the, course, of, the, orinoco, forms, a, wide, ellipsoidal, arc, surrounding, the, guiana, shield, it, is, divided, in, four, stretches, of, unequal, length, that, very, roughly, correspond, to, the, longitudinal, zonation, of, a, typical, large, river, at, its, mouth, the, orinoco, river, forms, a, wide, delta, that, branches, off, into, hundreds, of, rivers, and, waterways, that, flow, through, 41, 000, km, 2, 16, 000, sq, mi, of, swampy, forests, in, the, rainy, season, the, orinoco, river, can, swell, to, a, breadth, of, 22, kilometres, 14, mi, and, a, depth, of, 100, metres, 330, ft, most, of, the, important, venezuelan, rivers, are, tributaries, of, the, orinoco, river, the, largest, being, the, caron, which, joins, it, at, puerto, ordaz, close, to, the, llovizna, falls, a, peculiarity, of, the, orinoco, river, system, is, the, casiquiare, canal, which, starts, as, an, arm, of, the, orinoco, and, finds, its, way, to, the, rio, negro, a, tributary, of, the, amazon, thus, forming, a, natural, canal, between, orinoco, and, amazon, the, stream, gradient, of, the, entire, river, is, 0, 05, 1, 047, m, over, 2, 250, km, downstream, of, raudales, de, guaharibos, the, gradient, is, 0, 01, 183, 1, 964, which, is, also, the, gradient, from, ciudad, bolivar, to, the, ocean, 54, 435, average, minimum, and, maximum, discharge, at, ciudad, bol, var, and, ciudad, guayana,

world, its, range, in, the, wild, is, restricted, to, the, middle, and, lower, orinoco, river, basin, more, than, 1000, fish, species, have, been, recorded, in, the, river, basin, and, about, 15, are, endemic, among, the, fish, in, the, river, are, species, found, in, brackish, or, salt, water, in, the, orinoco, estuary, but, also, many, restricted, to, fresh, water, by, far, the, largest, orders, are, characiformes, and, siluriformes, which, together, account, for, more, than, 80, of, the, fresh, water, species, some, of, the, more, famous, are, the, black, spot, piranha, and, the, cardinal, tetra, the, latter, species, which, is, important, in, the, aquarium, industry, is, also, found, in, the, rio, negro, revealing, the, connection, between, this, river, and, the, orinoco, through, the, casiquiare, canal, because, the, casiquiare, includes, both, blackwater, and, clear, to, whitewater, sections, only, relatively, adaptable, species, are, able, to, pass, through, it, between, the, two, river, systems, the, river, is, navigable, for, most, of, its, length, and, dredging, enables, ocean, ships, to, go, as, far, as, ciudad, bol, var, at, the, confluence, of, the, caron, river, 435, kilometres, 270, mi, upstream, river, steamers, carry, cargo, as, far, as, puerto, ayacucho, and, the, atures, rapids, in, 1926, a, venezuelan, mining, inspector, found, one, of, the, richest, iron, ore, deposits, near, the, orinoco, delta, south, of, the, city, of, san, felix, on, a, mountain, named, el, florero, full, scale, mining, of, the, ore, deposits, began, after, world, war, ii, by, a, conglomerate, of, venezuelan, firms, and, us, steel, companies, at, the, start, in, the, early, 1950s, about, 10, 000, tons, of, ore, bearing, soil, was, mined, per, day, the, orinoco, river, deposits, also, contain, extensive, tar, sands, in, the, orinoco, oil, belt, which, may, be, a, source, of, future, oil, production, encompassing, the, states, of, anzoategui, guarico, and, monagas, states, the, interior, range, forms, the, northern, boundary, and, the, guayana, shield, the, southern, boundary, 155, maturin, forms, the, eastern, subbasin, and, guarico, forms, the, western, subbasin, 156, the, el, furrial, oil, field, was, discovered, in, 1978, producing, from, late, oligocene, shallow, marine, sandstones, in, an, overthrusted, foreland, basin, 155, since, 1973, the,
