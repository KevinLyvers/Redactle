the, kattegat, danish, swedish, kattegatt, is, a, 30, 000, km, 2, 12, 000, sq, mi, sea, area, bounded, by, the, jutlandic, peninsula, in, the, west, the, danish, straits, islands, of, denmark, and, the, baltic, sea, to, the, south, and, the, provinces, of, bohusl, n, v, sterg, tland, halland, and, sk, ne, in, sweden, in, the, east, the, baltic, sea, drains, into, the, kattegat, through, the, danish, straits, the, sea, area, is, a, continuation, of, the, skagerrak, and, may, be, seen, as, a, bay, of, the, north, sea, and, north, atlantic, ocean, but, in, traditional, scandinavian, usage, this, is, not, the, case, the, kattegat, is, a, rather, shallow, sea, and, can, be, very, difficult, and, dangerous, to, navigate, because, of, the, many, sandy, and, stony, reefs, and, tricky, currents, which, often, shift, in, modern, times, artificial, seabed, channels, have, been, dug, many, reefs, have, been, dredged, by, either, sand, pumping, or, boulder, clearance, and, a, well, developed, light, signaling, network, has, been, installed, to, safeguard, the, very, heavy, international, traffic, on, this, small, sea, there, are, several, large, cities, and, major, ports, on, the, kattegat, including, in, descending, size, gothenburg, aarhus, aalborg, halmstad, varberg, and, frederikshavn, according, to, the, definition, established, in, a, 1932, convention, signed, by, denmark, norway, and, sweden, registered, in, the, league, of, nations, treaty, series, 1933, 1934, the, northern, boundary, between, the, kattegat, and, skagerrak, are, found, at, the, northernmost, point, of, skagen, on, jutland, while, the, southern, boundary, towards, resund, is, found, at, the, tip, of, kullen, peninsula, in, scania, major, waterways, that, drain, into, the, kattegat, are, the, rivers, of, g, ta, lv, at, gothenburg, together, with, the, lagan, nissan, tran, and, viskan, in, the, province, of, halland, on, the, swedish, side, and, the, river, of, guden, in, jutland, in, denmark, the, main, islands, of, the, kattegat, are, sams, l, s, and, anholt, the, latter, two, are, due, to, their, relatively, dry, climate, perceived, as, belonging, to, the, danish, desert, belt, a, number, of, noteworthy, coastal, areas, abut, the, kattegat, including, the, kullaberg, nature, reserve, in, scania, sweden, which, contains, a, number, of, rare, species, and, a, scenic, rocky, shore, the, town, of, m, lle, which, has, a, picturesque, harbour, and, views, into, the, kullaberg, and, skagen, at, the, northern, tip, of, denmark, since, the, 1950s, a, bridge, project, usually, referred, to, as, kattegatbroen, the, kattegat, bridge, connecting, jutland, and, zealand, across, the, kattegat, has, been, considered, since, the, late, 2000s, the, project, has, seen, a, renewed, interest, from, several, influential, politicians, in, denmark, the, bridge, is, usually, envisioned, as, connecting, hov, a, village, south, of, odder, in, the, aarhus, area, with, sams, and, kalundborg, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, kattegat, sound, and, belts, that, is, the, kattegat, resund, great, belt, and, little, belt, as, follows, on, the, north, a, line, joining, skagen, the, skaw, northernmost, point, of, denmark, and, paternoster, sk, r, 57, 54, n, 11, 27, e, 57, 900, n, 11, 450, e, 57, 900, 11, 450, and, thence, northeastward, through, the, shoals, to, tj, rn, island, on, the, south, the, limits, of, the, baltic, sea, in, the, belts, and, sound, according, to, den, store, danske, encyklop, di, and, nudansk, ordbog, the, name, derives, from, the, dutch, words, katte, cat, s, and, gat, gate, passage, it, derives, from, late, medieval, navigation, jargon, in, which, captains, of, the, hanseatic, trading, fleets, would, compare, the, danish, straits, to, a, passage, so, tight, that, even, a, cat, would, have, difficulty, squeezing, its, way, through, owing, to, the, many, reefs, and, shoals, at, one, point, the, passable, waters, were, a, mere, 3, 84, km, 2, 07, nmi, 4, 200, yd, wide, the, name, of, the, copenhagen, street, kattesundet, has, a, comparable, etymological, meaning, namely, narrow, passage, lit, cat, s, strait, an, archaic, name, for, both, the, skagerrak, and, kattegat, was, the, norwegian, sea, or, jutland, sea, kn, tlinga, saga, mentions, the, name, j, tlandshaf, its, ancient, latin, name, was, sinus, codanus, control, of, the, kattegat, and, access, to, it, have, been, important, throughout, the, history, of, international, seafaring, until, the, completion, of, the, eider, canal, in, 1784, the, kattegat, was, the, only, sea, route, into, and, out, of, the, baltic, region, beginning, in, 1429, in, the, middle, ages, the, danish, royal, family, and, later, the, state, of, denmark, prospered, greatly, from, the, sound, dues, a, toll, charged, for, passage, through, the, resund, while, copenhagen, provided, shelter, trade, and, repair, opportunities, and, protection, from, piracy, the, dues, were, eventually, lifted, in, 1857, in, the, kattegat, the, salinity, has, a, pronounced, two, layer, structure, the, upper, layer, has, a, salinity, between, 18, and, 26, and, the, lower, layer, separated, by, a, strong, halocline, at, around, 15, m, 49, ft, has, a, salinity, between, 32, and, 34, the, lower, layer, consists, of, inflowing, seawater, from, the, skagerrak, with, a, salinity, on, level, with, most, other, coastal, seawaters, while, the, upper, layer, consists, of, inflowing, seawater, from, the, baltic, sea, and, has, a, much, lower, salinity, comparable, to, brackish, water, but, still, a, great, deal, higher, than, the, rest, of, the, baltic, sea, these, two, opposing, flows, transport, a, net, surplus, of, 475, km, 3, 114, cu, mi, seawater, from, the, baltic, to, the, skagerrak, every, year, during, stronger, winds, the, layers, in, the, kattegat, are, completely, mixed, in, some, places, such, as, the, great, belt, so, the, overall, salinity, is, highly, variable, in, this, small, sea, this, sets, some, unique, conditions, for, the, sealife, here, cold, seeps, locally, known, as, bubbling, reefs, danish, boblerev, are, found, in, the, northern, kattegat, unlike, cold, seeps, in, most, other, places, including, the, north, sea, and, skagerrak, the, kattegat, bubbling, reefs, are, at, relatively, shallow, depths, generally, between, 0, and, 30, m, 0, 100, ft, below, the, surface, the, seeps, rely, on, methane, deposited, during, the, eemian, period, and, during, calm, weather, the, bubbles, can, sometimes, be, seen, on, the, water, surface, carbonate, cementation, and, lithification, form, slaps, or, pillars, up, to, 4, m, 13, ft, tall, and, support, a, rich, biodiversity, because, of, their, unique, status, the, kattegat, bubbling, reefs, receive, a, level, of, protection, and, are, recognized, as, a, natura, 2000, habitat, type, 1180, by, the, european, union, eu, the, kattegat, characterised, by, widespread, anoxia, was, one, of, the, first, marine, dead, zones, to, be, noted, in, the, 1970s, when, scientists, began, studying, how, intensive, industrial, activities, affected, the, natural, world, since, then, studies, and, research, has, provided, much, insight, into, processes, like, eutrophication, and, how, to, deal, with, it, denmark, and, the, eu, have, initiated, costly, and, far, reaching, domestic, projects, in, order, to, stop, repair, and, prevent, these, environmentally, destructive, and, economically, damaging, processes, since, the, first, action, plan, for, the, aquatic, environment, in, 1985, and, are, now, busy, implementing, the, fourth, action, plan, the, action, plans, sums, up, a, broad, range, of, initiatives, and, includes, the, so, called, nitrate, directives, the, action, plans, have, generally, been, viewed, as, a, success, although, the, work, is, not, finished, and, all, goals, are, not, completely, met, yet, due, to, the, very, heavy, sea, traffic, and, many, large, coastal, settlements, the, kattegat, has, been, designated, as, a, sulphur, emission, control, area, as, part, of, the, baltic, sea, since, 2006, as, from, 1, january, 2016, the, benchmark, for, sulphur, in, fuels, was, lowered, to, 0, 1, several, larger, areas, of, the, kattegat, are, designated, as, natura, 2000, and, under, various, bird, protections, such, as, the, ramsar, convention, the, remaining, larger, shallow, reefs, are, among, the, protections, as, they, are, important, spawning, and, feeding, grounds, for, fish, and, marine, mammals, and, they, support, a, thriving, but, threatened, biodiversity, protected, areas, includes, denmark, sweden
