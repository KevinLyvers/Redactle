described, as, part, of, the, isthmo, colombian, area, stone, tools, the, oldest, evidence, of, human, occupation, in, costa, rica, are, associated, with, the, arrival, of, various, groups, of, hunter, gatherers, about, 10, 000, to, 7, 000, years, bce, in, the, turrialba, valley, the, presence, of, clovis, culture, type, spearheads, and, arrows, from, south, america, opens, the, possibility, that, in, this, area, two, different, cultures, coexisted, agriculture, became, evident, in, the, populations, that, lived, in, costa, rica, about, 5, 000, years, ago, they, mainly, grew, tubers, and, roots, for, the, first, and, second, millennia, bce, there, were, already, settled, farming, communities, these, were, small, and, scattered, although, the, timing, of, the, transition, from, hunting, and, gathering, to, agriculture, as, the, main, livelihood, in, the, territory, is, still, unknown, the, earliest, use, of, pottery, appears, around, 2, 000, to, 3, 000, bce, shards, of, pots,

on, modern, costa, rican, culture, has, been, relatively, small, compared, to, other, nations, since, the, country, lacked, a, strong, native, civilization, to, begin, with, most, of, the, native, population, was, absorbed, into, the, spanish, speaking, colonial, society, through, inter, marriage, except, for, some, small, remnants, the, most, significant, of, which, are, the, bribri, and, boruca, tribes, who, still, inhabit, the, mountains, of, the, cordillera, de, talamanca, in, the, southeastern, part, of, costa, rica, near, the, frontier, with, panama, the, name, la, costa, rica, meaning, rich, coast, in, the, spanish, language, was, in, some, accounts, first, applied, by, christopher, columbus, who, sailed, to, the, eastern, shores, of, costa, rica, during, his, final, voyage, in, 1502, and, reported, vast, quantities, of, gold, jewelry, worn, by, natives, the, name, may, also, have, come, from, conquistador, gil, gonz, lez, d, vila, who, landed, on, the, west, coast, in, 1522, encountered, natives, and, obtained, some, of, their, gold, sometimes, by, violent, theft, and, sometimes, as, gifts, from, local, leaders, during, most, of, the, colonial, period, costa, rica, was, the, southernmost, province, of, the, captaincy, general, of, guatemala, nominally, part, of, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, in, practice, the, captaincy, general, was, a, largely, autonomous, entity, within, the, spanish, empire, costa, rica, s, distance, from, the, capital, of, the, captaincy, in, guatemala, its, legal, prohibition, under, mercantilist, spanish, law, from, trade, with, its, southern, neighbor, panama, then, part, of, the, viceroyalty, of, new, granada, i, e, colombia, and, lack, of, resources, such, as, gold, and, silver, made, costa, rica, into, a, poor, isolated, and, sparsely, inhabited, region, within, the, spanish, empire, costa, rica, was, described, as, the, poorest, and, most, miserable, spanish, colony, in, all, america, by, a, spanish, governor, in, 1719, another, important, factor, behind, costa, rica, s, poverty, was, the, lack, of, a, significant, indigenous, population, available, for, encomienda, forced, labor, which, meant, most, of, the, costa, rican, settlers, had, to, work, on, their, land, preventing, the, establishment, of, large, haciendas, plantations, for, all, these, reasons, costa, rica, was, by, and, large, unappreciated, and, overlooked, by, the, spanish, crown, and, left, to, develop, on, its, own, the, circumstances, during, this, period, are, believed, to, have, led, to, many, of, the, idiosyncrasies, for, which, costa, rica, has, become, known, while, concomitantly, setting, the, stage, for, costa, rica, s, development, as, a, more, egalitarian, society, than, the, rest, of, its, neighbors, costa, rica, became, a, rural, democracy, with, no, oppressed, mestizo, or, indigenous, class, it, was, not, long, before, spanish, settlers, turned, to, the, hills, where, they, found, rich, volcanic, soil, and, a, milder, climate, than, that, of, the, lowlands, like, the, rest, of, central, america, costa, rica, never, fought, for, independence, from, spain, on, 15, september, 1821, after, the, final, spanish, defeat, in, the, mexican, war, of, independence, 1810, 1821, the, authorities, in, guatemala, declared, the, independence, of, all, of, central, america, that, date, is, still, celebrated, as, independence, day, in, costa, rica, even, though, technically, under, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1812, that, had, been, readopted, in, 1820, nicaragua, and, costa, rica, had, become, an, autonomous, province, with, its, capital, in, le, n, on, march, 3, 1824, the, government, of, the, state, of, costa, rica, officially, proposed, to, the, municipality, of, nicoya, its, voluntary, incorporation, into, the, country, through, a, document, in, which, it, invited, it, if, it, was, convenient, to, join, its, province, without, going, against, its, will, on, july, 4, an, open, town, hall, was, convened, in, nicoya, to, discuss, the, matter, but, attendees, declined, the, invitation, under, the, argument, that, this, party, cannot, be, dissident, on, july, 25, 1824, a, second, plebiscite, was, called, in, the, city, of, nicoya, after, deliberation, the, incorporation, into, costa, rica, was, decided, in, an, open, town, hall, meeting, preparing, a, record, in, which, the, main, reasons, for, it, were, noted, pointing, out, the, advantages, in, terms, of, trade, the, desire, to, participate, in, the, advances, that, are, palpable, in, costa, rica, the, economic, administrative, and, public, service, benefits, the, creation, of, schools, security, and, quiet, referring, to, the, state, of, war, that, nicaragua, was, experiencing, at, that, time, and, the, fear, that, it, would, spread, to, the, partido, populations, in, addition, to, point, out, the, poverty, in, which, its, towns, find, themselves, and, the, geography, of, the, territory, as, justifications, for, the, union, three, days, later, another, similar, plebiscite, was, held, in, santa, cruz, with, the, same, result, the, election, was, by, majority, vote, with, 77, of, the, party, s, population, in, favor, of, incorporation, and, 23, against, it, the, town, of, guanacaste, was, the, only, one, that, declined, annexation, due, to, the, ties, its, residents, had, with, the, city, of, rivas, nicaragua, upon, independence, costa, rican, authorities, faced, the, issue, of, officially, deciding, the, future, of, the, country, two, bands, formed, the, imperialists, defended, by, cartago, and, heredia, cities, which, were, in, favor, of, joining, the, mexican, empire, and, the, republicans, represented, by, the, cities, of, san, jos, and, alajuela, who, defended, full, independence, because, of, the, lack, of, agreement, on, these, two, possible, outcomes, the, first, civil, war, of, costa, rica, occurred, the, battle, of, ochomogo, took, place, on, the, hill, of, ochomogo, located, in, the, central, valley, in, 1823, the, conflict, was, won, by, the, republicans, and, as, a, consequence, the, city, of, cartago, lost, its, status, as, the, capital, which, moved, to, san, jos, in, 1838, long, after, the, federal, republic, of, central, america, ceased, to, function, in, practice, costa, rica, formally, withdrew, and, proclaimed, itself, sovereign, the, considerable, distance, and, poor, communication, routes, between, guatemala, city, and, the, central, plateau, where, most, of, the, costa, rican, population, lived, then, and, still, lives, now, meant, the, local, population, had, little, allegiance, to, the, federal, government, in, guatemala, since, colonial, times, costa, rica, has, been, reluctant, to, become, economically, tied, with, the, rest, of, central, america, even, today, despite, most, of, its, neighbors, efforts, to, increase, regional, integration, costa, rica, has, remained, more, independent, until, 1849, when, it, became, part, of, panama, chiriqu, was, part, of, costa, rica, costa, rican, pride, was, assuaged, for, the, loss, of, this, eastern, or, southern, territory, with, the, acquisition, of, guanacaste, in, the, north, coffee, was, first, planted, in, costa, rica, in, 1808, and, by, the, 1820s, it, surpassed, tobacco, sugar, and, cacao, as, a, primary, export, coffee, production, remained, costa, rica, s, principal, source, of, wealth, well, into, the, 20th, century, creating, a, wealthy, class, of, growers, the, so, called, coffee, barons, the, revenue, helped, to, modernize, the, country, most, of, the, coffee, exported, was, grown, around, the, main, centers, of, population, in, the, central, plateau, and, then, transported, by, oxcart, to, the, pacific, port, of, puntarenas, after, the, main, road, was, built, in, 1846, by, the, mid, 1850s, the, main, market, for, coffee, was, britain, it, soon, became, a, high, priority, to, develop, an, effective, transportation, route, from, the, central, plateau, to, the, atlantic, ocean, for, this, purpose, in, the, 1870s, the, costa, rican, government, contracted, with, u, s, businessman, minor, c, keith, to, build, a, railroad, from, san, jos, to, the, caribbean, port, of, lim, n, despite, enormous, difficulties, with, construction, disease, and, financing, the, railroad, was, completed, in, 1890, most, afro, costa, ricans, descend, from, jamaican, immigrants, who, worked, in, the, construction, of, that, railway, and, now, make, up, about, 3, of, costa, rica, s, population, u, s, convicts, italians, and, chinese, immigrants, also, participated, in, the, construction, project, in, exchange, for, completing, the, railroad, the, costa, rican, government, granted, keith, large, tracts, of, land, and, a, lease, on, the, train, route, which, he, used, to, produce, bananas, and, export, them, to, the, united, states, as, a, result, bananas, came, to, rival, coffee, as, the, principal, costa, rican, export, while, foreign, owned, corporations, including, the, united, fruit, company, later, began, to, hold, a, major, role, in, the, national, economy, and, eventually, became, a, symbol, of, the, exploitative, export, economy, the, major, labor, dispute, between, the, peasants, and, the, united, fruit, company, the, great, banana, strike, was, a, major, event, in, the, country, s, history, and, was, an, important, step, that, would, eventually, lead, to, the, formation, of, effective, trade, unions, in, costa, rica, as, the, company, was, required, to, sign, a, collective, agreement, with, its, workers, in, 1938, historically, costa, rica, has, generally, enjoyed, greater, peace, and, more, consistent, political, stability, than, many, of, its, fellow, latin, american, nations, since, the,

was, overthrown, and, forced, into, exile, the, unpopularity, of, tinoco, s, regime, led, after, he, was, overthrown, to, a, considerable, decline, in, the, size, wealth, and, political, influence, of, the, costa, rican, military, in, 1948, jos, figueres, ferrer, led, an, armed, uprising, in, the, wake, of, a, disputed, presidential, election, between, rafael, ngel, calder, n, guardia, who, had,
