urbanization, or, urbanisation, in, british, english, is, the, population, shift, from, rural, to, urban, areas, the, corresponding, decrease, in, the, proportion, of, people, living, in, rural, areas, and, the, ways, in, which, societies, adapt, to, this, change, it, can, also, mean, population, growth, in, urban, areas, instead, of, rural, ones, it, is, predominantly, the, process, by, which, towns, and, cities, are, formed, and, become, larger, as, more, people, begin, living, and, working, in, central, areas, although, the, two, concepts, are, sometimes, used, interchangeably, urbanization, should, be, distinguished, from, urban, growth, urbanization, refers, to, the, proportion, of, the, total, national, population, living, in, areas, classified, as, urban, whereas, urban, growth, strictly, refers, to, the, absolute, number, of, people, living, in, those, areas, it, is, predicted, that, by, 2050, about, 64, of, the, developing, world, and, 86, of, the, developed, world, will, be, urbanized, this, is, predicted, to, generate, artificial, scarcities, of, land, lack, of, drinking, water, playgrounds, and, so, on, for, most, urban, dwellers, the, predicted, urban, population, growth, is, equivalent, to, approximately, 3, billion, urbanites, by, 2050, much, of, which, will, occur, in, africa, and, asia, notably, the, united, nations, has, also, recently, projected, that, nearly, all, global, population, growth, from, 2017, to, 2030, will, be, by, cities, with, about, 1, 1, billion, new, urbanites, over, the, next, 10, years, in, the, long, term, urbanization, is, expected, to, significantly, impact, the, quality, of, life, in, negative, ways, urbanization, is, relevant, to, a, range, of, disciplines, including, urban, planning, geography, sociology, architecture, economics, education, statistics, and, public, health, the, phenomenon, has, been, closely, linked, to, globalization, modernization, industrialization, marketization, administrative, institutional, power, and, the, sociological, process, of, rationalization, urbanization, can, be, seen, as, a, specific, condition, at, a, set, time, e, g, the, proportion, of, total, population, or, area, in, cities, or, towns, or, as, an, increase, in, that, condition, over, time, therefore, urbanization, can, be, quantified, either, in, terms, of, the, level, of, urban, development, relative, to, the, overall, population, or, as, the, rate, at, which, the, urban, proportion, of, the, population, is, increasing, urbanization, creates, enormous, social, economic, and, environmental, challenges, which, provide, an, opportunity, for, sustainability, with, the, potential, to, use, resources, much, less, or, more, efficiently, to, create, more, sustainable, land, use, and, to, protect, the, biodiversity, of, natural, ecosystems, however, current, urbanization, trends, have, shown, that, massive, urbanization, has, led, to, unsustainable, ways, of, living, developing, urban, resilience, and, urban, sustainability, in, the, face, of, increased, urbanization, is, at, the, centre, of, international, policy, in, sustainable, development, goal, 11, sustainable, cities, and, communities, urbanization, is, not, merely, a, modern, phenomenon, but, a, rapid, and, historic, transformation, of, human, social, roots, on, a, global, scale, whereby, predominantly, rural, culture, is, being, rapidly, replaced, by, predominantly, urban, culture, the, first, major, change, in, settlement, patterns, was, the, accumulation, of, hunter, gatherers, into, villages, many, thousands, of, years, ago, village, culture, is, characterized, by, common, bloodlines, intimate, relationships, and, communal, behaviour, whereas, urban, culture, is, characterized, by, distant, bloodlines, unfamiliar, relations, and, competitive, behaviour, this, unprecedented, movement, of, people, is, forecast, to, continue, and, intensify, during, the, next, few, decades, mushrooming, cities, to, sizes, unthinkable, only, a, century, ago, as, a, result, the, world, urban, population, growth, curve, has, up, till, recently, followed, a, quadratic, hyperbolic, pattern, from, the, development, of, the, earliest, cities, in, indus, valley, civilization, mesopotamia, and, egypt, until, the, 18th, century, an, equilibrium, existed, between, the, vast, majority, of, the, population, who, were, engaged, in, subsistence, agriculture, in, a, rural, context, and, small, centres, of, populations, in, the, towns, where, economic, activity, consisted, primarily, of, trade, at, markets, and, manufactures, on, a, small, scale, due, to, the, primitive, and, relatively, stagnant, state, of, agriculture, throughout, this, period, the, ratio, of, rural, to, urban, population, remained, at, a, fixed, equilibrium, however, a, significant, increase, in, the, percentage, of, the, global, urban, population, can, be, traced, in, the, 1st, millennium, bce, with, the, onset, of, the, british, agricultural, revolution, and, industrial, revolution, in, the, late, 18th, century, this, relationship, was, finally, broken, and, an, unprecedented, growth, in, urban, population, took, place, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, both, through, continued, migration, from, the, countryside, and, due, to, the, tremendous, demographic, expansion, that, occurred, at, that, time, in, england, and, wales, the, proportion, of, the, population, living, in, cities, with, more, than, 20, 000, people, jumped, from, 17, in, 1801, to, 54, in, 1891, moreover, and, adopting, a, broader, definition, of, urbanization, while, the, urbanized, population, in, england, and, wales, represented, 72, of, the, total, in, 1891, for, other, countries, the, figure, was, 37, in, france, 41, in, prussia, and, 28, in, the, united, states, as, labourers, were, freed, up, from, working, the, land, due, to, higher, agricultural, productivity, they, converged, on, the, new, industrial, cities, like, manchester, and, birmingham, which, were, experiencing, a, boom, in, commerce, trade, and, industry, growing, trade, around, the, world, also, allowed, cereals, to, be, imported, from, north, america, and, refrigerated, meat, from, australasia, and, south, america, spatially, cities, also, expanded, due, to, the, development, of, public, transport, systems, which, facilitated, commutes, of, longer, distances, to, the, city, centre, for, the, working, class, urbanization, rapidly, spread, across, the, western, world, and, since, the, 1950s, it, has, begun, to, take, hold, in, the, developing, world, as, well, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, just, 15, of, the, world, population, lived, in, cities, according, to, the, un, the, year, 2007, witnessed, the, turning, point, when, more, than, 50, of, the, world, population, were, living, in, cities, for, the, first, time, in, human, history, yale, university, in, june, 2016, published, urbanization, data, from, the, time, period, 3700, bc, to, 2000, ad, the, data, was, used, to, make, a, video, showing, the, development, of, cities, on, the, world, during, the, time, period, the, origins, and, spread, of, urban, centres, around, the, world, were, also, mapped, by, archaeologists, urbanization, occurs, either, organically, or, planned, as, a, result, of, individual, collective, and, state, action, living, in, a, city, can, be, culturally, and, economically, beneficial, since, it, can, provide, greater, opportunities, for, access, to, the, labour, market, better, education, housing, and, safety, conditions, and, reduce, the, time, and, expense, of, commuting, and, transportation, conditions, like, density, proximity, diversity, and, marketplace, competition, are, elements, of, an, urban, environment, that, deemed, beneficial, however, there, are, also, harmful, social, phenomena, that, arise, alienation, stress, increased, cost, of, living, and, mass, marginalization, that, are, connected, to, an, urban, way, of, living, suburbanization, which, is, happening, in, the, cities, of, the, largest, developing, countries, may, be, regarded, as, an, attempt, to, balance, these, harmful, aspects, of, urban, life, while, still, allowing, access, to, the, large, extent, of, shared, resources, in, cities, money, services, wealth, and, opportunities, are, centralized, many, rural, inhabitants, come, to, the, city, to, seek, their, fortune, and, alter, their, social, position, businesses, which, provide, jobs, and, exchange, capital, are, more, concentrated, in, urban, areas, whether, the, source, is, trade, or, tourism, it, is, also, through, the, ports, or, banking, systems, commonly, located, in, cities, that, foreign, money, flows, into, a, country, many, people, move, into, cities, for, economic, opportunities, but, this, does, not, fully, explain, the, very, high, recent, urbanization, rates, in, places, like, china, and, india, rural, flight, is, a, contributing, factor, to, urbanization, in, rural, areas, often, on, small, family, farms, or, collective, farms, in, villages, it, has, historically, been, difficult, to, access, manufactured, goods, though, the, relative, overall, quality, of, life, is, very, subjective, and, may, certainly, surpass, that, of, the, city, farm, living, has, always, been, susceptible, to, unpredictable, environmental, conditions, and, in, times, of, drought, flood, or, pestilence, survival, may, become, extremely, problematic, iam, thongdee, professor, of, humanities, mahidol, university, in, bangkok, in, a, new, york, times, article, concerning, the, acute, migration, away, from, farming, in, thailand, life, as, a, farmer, was, described, as, hot, and, exhausting, everyone, says, the, farmer, works, the, hardest, but, gets, the, least, amount, of, money, in, an, effort, to, counter, this, impression, the, agriculture, department, of, thailand, is, seeking, to, promote, the, impression, that, farming, is, honorable, and, secure, however, in, thailand, urbanization, has, also, resulted, in, massive, increases, in, problems, such, as, obesity, shifting, from, a, rural, environment, to, an, urbanized, community, also, caused, a, transition, to, a, diet, that, was, mainly, carbohydrate, based, to, a, diet, higher, in, fat, and, sugar, consequently, causing, a, rise, in, obesity, city, life, especially, in, modern, urban, slums, of, the, developing, world, is, certainly, hardly, immune, to, pestilence, or, climatic, disturbances, such, as, floods, yet, continues, to, strongly, attract, migrants, examples, of, this, were, the, 2011, thailand, floods, and, 2007, jakarta, flood, urban, areas, are, also, far, more, prone, to, violence, drugs, and, other, urban, social, problems, in, the, united, states, industrialization, of, agriculture, has, negatively, affected, the, economy, of, small, and, middle, sized, farms, and, strongly, reduced, the, size, of, the, rural, labour, market, madhura, swaminathan, economist, at, kolkata, s, indian, statistical, institute, particularly, in, the, developing, world, conflict, over, land, rights, due, to, the, effects, of, globalization, has, led, to, less, politically, powerful, groups, such, as, farmers, losing, or, forfeiting, their, land, resulting, in, obligatory, migration, into, cities, in, china, where, land, acquisition, measures, are, forceful, there, has, been, far, more, extensive, and, rapid, urbanization, 54, than, in, india, 36, where, peasants, form, militant, groups, e, g, naxalites, to, oppose, such, efforts, obligatory, and, unplanned, migration, often, results, in, the, rapid, growth, of, slums, this, is, also, similar, to, areas, of, violent, conflict, where, people, are, driven, off, their, land, due, to, violence, cities, offer, a, larger, variety, of, services, including, specialist, services, not, found, in, rural, areas, these, services, require, workers, resulting, in, more, numerous, and, varied, job, opportunities, elderly, people, may, be, forced, to, move, to, cities, where, there, are, doctors, and, hospitals, that, can, cater, to, their, health, needs, varied, and, high, quality, educational, opportunities, are, another, factor, in, urban, migration, as, well, as, the, opportunity, to, join, develop, and, seek, out, social, communities, urbanization, also, creates, opportunities, for, women, that, are, not, available, in, rural, areas, this, creates, a, gender, related, transformation, where, women, are, engaged, in, paid, employment, and, have, access, to, education, this, may, cause, fertility, to, decline, however, women, are, sometimes, still, at, a, disadvantage, due, to, their, unequal, position, in, the, labour, market, their, inability, to, secure, assets, independently, from, male, relatives, and, exposure, to, violence, people, in, cities, are, more, productive, than, in, rural, areas, an, important, question, is, whether, this, is, due, to, agglomeration, effects, or, whether, cities, simply, attract, those, who, are, more, productive, urban, geographers, have, shown, that, there, exists, a, large, productivity, gain, due, to, locating, in, dense, agglomerations, it, is, thus, possible, that, agents, locate, in, cities, in, order, to, benefit, from, these, agglomeration, effects, the, dominant, conurbation, s, of, a, country, can, get, more, benefits, from, the, same, things, cities, offer, attracting, the, rural, population, and, urban, and, suburban, populations, from, other, cities, dominant, conurbations, are, quite, often, disproportionately, large, cities, but, do, not, have, to, be, for, instance, greater, manila, is, a, conurbation, instead, of, a, city, its, total, population, of, 20, million, over, 20, national, population, make, it, a, primate, city, but, quezon, city, 2, 7, million, the, largest, municipality, in, greater, manila, and, manila, 1, 6, million, the, capital, are, normal, cities, instead, a, conurbation, s, dominance, can, be, measured, by, output, wealth, and, especially, population, each, expressed, as, a, percentage, of, the, entire, country, s, greater, seoul, is, one, conurbation, that, dominates, south, korea, it, is, home, to, 50, of, the, entire, national, population, though, greater, busan, ulsan, 15, 8, million, and, greater, osaka, 14, 18, million, dominate, their, respective, countries, their, populations, are, moving, to, their, even, more, dominant, rivals, seoul, and, tokyo, respectively, as, cities, develop, costs, will, skyrocket, this, often, takes, the, working, class, out, of, the, market, including, officials, and, employees, of, the, local, districts, for, example, eric, hobsbawm, s, book, the, age, of, revolution, 1789, 1848, published, 1962, and, 2005, chapter, 11, stated, urban, development, in, our, period, was, a, gigantic, process, of, class, segregation, which, pushed, the, new, labouring, poor, into, great, morasses, of, misery, outside, the, centres, of, government, business, and, the, newly, specialized, residential, areas, of, the, bourgeoisie, the, almost, universal, european, division, into, a, good, west, end, and, a, poor, east, end, of, large, cities, developed, in, this, period, this, is, probably, caused, by, the, south, west, wind, which, carries, coal, smoke, and, other, pollutants, down, making, the, western, edges, of, towns, better, than, the, eastern, ones, similar, problems, now, affect, less, developed, countries, as, rapid, development, of, cities, makes, inequality, worse, the, drive, to, grow, quickly, and, be, efficient, can, lead, to, less, fair, urban, development, think, tanks, such, as, the, overseas, development, institute, have, proposed, policies, that, encourage, labour, intensive, to, make, use, of, the, migration, of, less, skilled, workers, one, problem, these, migrant, workers, are, involved, with, is, the, growth, of, slums, in, many, cases, the, rural, urban, unskilled, migrant, workers, are, attracted, by, economic, opportunities, in, cities, unfortunately, they, cannot, find, a, job, and, or, pay, for, houses, in, urban, areas, and, have, to, live, in, slums, urban, problems, along, with, developments, in, their, facilities, are, also, fuelling, suburb, development, trends, in, less, developed, nations, though, the, trend, for, core, cities, in, said, nations, tends, to, continue, to, become, ever, denser, development, of, cities, is, often, viewed, negatively, but, there, are, positives, in, cutting, down, on, transport, costs, creating, new, job, opportunities, providing, education, and, housing, and, transportation, living, in, cities, permits, individuals, and, families, to, make, use, of, their, closeness, to, workplaces, and, diversity, while, cities, have, more, varied, markets, and, goods, than, rural, areas, facility, congestion, domination, of, one, group, high, overhead, and, rental, costs, and, the, inconvenience, of, trips, across, them, frequently, combine, to, make, marketplace, competition, harsher, in, cities, than, in, rural, areas, in, many, developing, countries, where, economies, are, growing, the, growth, is, often, random, and, based, on, a, small, number, of, industries, youths, in, these, nations, lack, access, to, financial, services, and, business, advisory, services, cannot, get, credit, to, start, a, business, and, have, no, entrepreneurial, skills, therefore, they, cannot, seize, opportunities, in, these, industries, making, sure, adolescents, have, access, to, excellent, schools, and, infrastructure, to, work, in, such, industries, and, improve, schools, is, compulsory, to, promote, a, fair, society, furthermore, urbanization, improves, environmental, eminence, through, superior, facilities, and, standards, in, urban, areas, as, compared, to, rural, areas, lastly, urbanization, curbs, pollution, emissions, by, increasing, innovations, in, his, 2009, book, whole, earth, discipline, stewart, brand, argues, that, the, effects, of, urbanization, are, primarily, positive, for, the, environment, first, the, birth, rate, of, new, urban, dwellers, falls, immediately, to, replacement, rate, and, keeps, falling, reducing, environmental, stresses, caused, by, population, growth, secondly, emigration, from, rural, areas, reduces, destructive, subsistence, farming, techniques, such, as, improperly, implemented, slash, and, burn, agriculture, alex, steffen, also, speaks, of, the, environmental, benefits, of, increasing, the, urbanization, level, in, carbon, zero, imagining, cities, that, can, save, the, planet, however, existing, infrastructure, and, city, planning, practices, are, not, sustainable, in, july, 2013, a, report, issued, by, the, united, nations, department, of, economic, and, social, affairs, warned, that, with, 2, 4, billion, more, people, by, 2050, the, amount, of, food, produced, will, have, to, increase, by, 70, straining, food, resources, especially, in, countries, already, facing, food, insecurity, due, to, changing, environmental, conditions, the, mix, of, changing, environmental, conditions, and, the, growing, population, of, urban, regions, according, to, un, experts, will, strain, basic, sanitation, systems, and, health, care, and, potentially, cause, a, humanitarian, and, environmental, disaster, urban, heat, islands, have, become, a, growing, concern, over, the, years, an, urban, heat, island, is, formed, when, industrial, areas, absorb, and, retain, heat, much, of, the, solar, energy, reaching, rural, areas, is, used, to, evaporate, water, from, plants, and, soil, in, cities, there, are, less, vegetation, and, exposed, soil, most, of, the, sun, s, energy, is, instead, absorbed, by, buildings, and, asphalt, leading, to, higher, surface, temperatures, vehicles, factories, and, heating, and, cooling, units, in, factories, and, homes, release, even, more, heat, as, a, result, cities, are, often, 1, to, 3, c, 1, 8, to, 5, 4, f, warmer, than, other, areas, near, them, urban, heat, islands, also, make, the, soil, drier, and, absorb, less, carbon, dioxide, from, emissions, urban, runoff, polluted, water, created, by, rainfall, on, impervious, surfaces, is, a, common, effect, of, urbanization, precipitation, from, rooftops, roads, parking, lots, and, sidewalks, flows, to, storm, drains, instead, of, percolating, into, groundwater, the, contaminated, stormwater, in, the, drains, is, typically, untreated, and, flows, to, nearby, streams, rivers, or, coastal, bays, eutrophication, in, water, bodies, is, another, effect, large, populations, in, cities, have, on, the, environment, when, rain, occurs, in, these, large, cities, it, filters, co, 2, and, other, pollutants, in, the, air, onto, the, ground, these, chemicals, are, washed, directly, into, rivers, streams, and, oceans, making, water, worse, and, damaging, ecosystems, in, them, eutrophication, is, a, process, which, causes, low, levels, of, oxygen, in, water, and, algal, blooms, that, may, harm, aquatic, life, harmful, algal, blooms, make, dangerous, toxins, they, live, best, in, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, rich, places, which, include, the, oceans, contaminated, by, the, aforementioned, chemicals, in, these, ideal, conditions, they, choke, surface, water, blocking, sunlight, and, nutrients, from, other, life, forms, overgrowth, of, algal, blooms, makes, water, worse, overall, and, disrupts, the, natural, balance, of, aquatic, ecosystems, furthermore, as, algal, blooms, die, co, 2, is, produced, this, makes, the, ocean, more, acidic, a, process, called, acidification, the, ocean, s, surface, can, absorb, co, 2, from, the, earth, s, atmosphere, as, emissions, increase, with, the, rise, in, urban, development, in, fact, the, ocean, absorbs, a, quarter, of, the, co, 2, produced, by, humans, this, helps, to, lessen, the, harmful, effects, of, greenhouse, gases, but, it, also, makes, the, ocean, more, acidic, a, drop, in, ph, the, prevents, the, proper, formation, of, calcium, carbonate, which, sea, creatures, need, to, build, or, keep, shells, or, skeletons, this, is, especially, true, for, many, species, of, molluscs, and, coral, however, some, species, have, been, able, to, thrive, in, a, more, acidic, environment, rapid, growth, of, communities, creates, new, challenges, in, the, developed, world, and, one, such, challenge, is, an, increase, in, food, waste, also, known, as, urban, food, waste, food, waste, is, the, disposal, of, food, products, that, can, no, longer, be, used, due, to, unused, products, expiration, or, spoilage, the, increase, of, food, waste, can, raise, environmental, concerns, such, as, increase, production, of, methane, gases, and, attraction, of, disease, vectors, landfills, are, the, third, leading, cause, of, the, release, of, methane, causing, a, concern, on, its, impact, to, our, ozone, and, on, the, health, of, individuals, accumulation, of, food, waste, causes, increased, fermentation, which, increases, the, risk, of, rodent, and, bug, migration, an, increase, in, migration, of, disease, vectors, creates, greater, potential, of, disease, spreading, to, humans, waste, management, systems, vary, on, all, scales, from, global, to, local, and, can, also, be, influenced, by, lifestyle, waste, management, was, not, a, primary, concern, until, after, the, industrial, revolution, as, urban, areas, continued, to, grow, along, with, the, human, population, proper, management, of, solid, waste, became, an, apparent, concern, to, address, these, concerns, local, governments, sought, solutions, with, the, lowest, economic, impacts, which, meant, implementing, technical, solutions, at, the, very, last, stage, of, the, process, current, waste, management, reflects, these, economically, motivated, solutions, such, as, incineration, or, unregulated, landfills, yet, a, growing, increase, for, addressing, other, areas, of, life, cycle, consumption, has, occurred, from, initial, stage, reduction, to, heat, recovery, and, recycling, of, materials, for, example, concerns, for, mass, consumption, and, fast, fashion, have, moved, to, the, forefront, of, the, urban, consumers, priorities, aside, from, environmental, concerns, e, g, climate, change, effects, other, urban, concerns, for, waste, management, are, public, health, and, land, access, urbanization, can, have, a, large, effect, on, biodiversity, by, causing, a, division, of, habitats, and, thereby, alienation, of, species, a, process, known, as, habitat, fragmentation, habitat, fragmentation, does, not, destroy, the, habitat, as, seen, in, habitat, loss, but, rather, breaks, it, apart, with, things, like, roads, and, railways, this, change, may, affect, a, species, ability, to, sustain, life, by, separating, it, from, the, environment, in, which, it, is, able, to, easily, access, food, and, find, areas, that, they, may, hide, from, predation, with, proper, planning, and, management, fragmentation, can, be, avoided, by, adding, corridors, that, aid, in, the, connection, of, areas, and, allow, for, easier, movement, around, urbanized, regions, depending, on, the, various, factors, such, as, level, of, urbanization, both, increases, or, decreases, in, species, richness, can, be, seen, this, means, that, urbanization, may, be, detrimental, to, one, species, but, also, help, facilitate, the, growth, of, others, in, instances, of, housing, and, building, development, many, times, vegetation, is, completely, removed, immediately, in, order, to, make, it, easier, and, less, expensive, for, construction, to, occur, thereby, obliterating, any, native, species, in, that, area, habitat, fragmentation, can, filter, species, with, limited, dispersal, capacity, for, example, aquatic, insects, are, found, to, have, lower, species, richness, in, urban, landscapes, the, more, urbanized, the, surrounding, of, habitat, is, the, fewer, species, can, reach, the, habitat, other, times, such, as, with, birds, urbanization, may, allow, for, an, increase, in, richness, when, organisms, are, able, to, adapt, to, the, new, environment, this, can, be, seen, in, species, that, may, find, food, while, scavenging, developed, areas, or, vegetation, that, has, been, added, after, urbanization, has, occurred, i, e, planted, trees, in, city, areas, jack, finegan, urban, programme, specialist, at, un, habitat, in, the, developing, world, urbanization, does, not, translate, into, a, significant, increase, in, life, expectancy, rapid, urbanization, has, led, to, increased, mortality, from, non, communicable, diseases, associated, with, lifestyle, including, cancer, and, heart, disease, differences, in, mortality, from, contagious, diseases, vary, depending, on, the, particular, disease, and, location, urban, health, levels, are, on, average, better, in, comparison, to, rural, areas, however, residents, in, poor, urban, areas, such, as, slums, and, informal, settlements, suffer, disproportionately, from, disease, injury, premature, death, and, the, combination, of, ill, health, and, poverty, entrenches, disadvantage, over, time, many, of, the, urban, poor, have, difficulty, accessing, health, services, due, to, their, inability, to, pay, for, them, so, they, resort, to, less, qualified, and, unregulated, providers, while, urbanization, is, associated, with, improvements, in, public, hygiene, sanitation, and, access, to, health, care, it, also, entails, changes, in, occupational, dietary, and, exercise, patterns, it, can, have, mixed, effects, on, health, patterns, alleviating, some, problems, and, accentuating, others, one, such, effect, is, the, formation, of, food, deserts, nearly, 23, 5, million, people, in, the, united, states, lack, access, to, supermarkets, within, one, mile, of, their, home, several, studies, suggest, that, long, distances, to, a, grocery, store, are, associated, with, higher, rates, of, obesity, and, other, health, disparities, food, deserts, in, developed, countries, often, correspond, to, areas, with, a, high, density, of, fast, food, chains, and, convenience, stores, that, offer, little, to, no, fresh, food, urbanization, has, been, shown, to, be, associated, with, the, consumption, of, less, fresh, fruits, vegetables, and, whole, grains, and, a, higher, consumption, of, processed, foods, and, sugar, sweetened, beverages, poor, access, to, healthy, food, and, high, intakes, of, fat, sugar, and, salt, are, associated, with, a, greater, risk, for, obesity, diabetes, and, related, chronic, disease, overall, body, mass, index, and, cholesterol, levels, increase, sharply, with, national, income, and, the, degree, of, urbanization, food, deserts, in, the, united, states, are, most, commonly, found, in, low, income, and, predominately, african, american, neighbourhoods, one, study, on, food, deserts, in, denver, colorado, found, that, in, addition, to, minorities, the, affected, neighbourhoods, also, had, a, high, proportion, of, children, and, new, births, in, children, urbanization, is, associated, with, a, lower, risk, of, under, nutrition, but, a, higher, risk, of, being, overweight, urbanization, has, also, been, linked, to, the, spread, of, communicable, diseases, which, can, spread, more, rapidly, in, the, favourable, environment, with, more, people, living, in, a, smaller, area, such, diseases, can, be, respiratory, infections, and, gastrointestinal, infections, other, infections, could, be, infections, which, need, a, vector, to, spread, to, humans, an, example, of, this, could, be, dengue, fever, urbanization, has, also, been, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, asthma, as, well, throughout, the, world, as, communities, transition, from, rural, to, more, urban, societies, the, number, of, people, affected, by, asthma, increases, the, odds, of, reduced, rates, of, hospitalization, and, death, from, asthmas, has, decreased, for, children, and, young, adults, in, urbanized, municipalities, in, brazil, this, finding, indicates, that, urbanization, may, have, a, negative, impact, on, population, health, particularly, affecting, people, s, susceptibility, to, asthma, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, many, factors, contribute, to, the, high, numbers, of, people, with, asthma, similar, to, areas, in, the, united, states, with, increasing, urbanization, people, living, in, growing, cities, in, low, income, countries, experience, high, exposure, to, air, pollution, which, increases, the, prevalence, and, severity, of, asthma, among, these, populations, links, have, been, found, between, exposure, to, traffic, related, air, pollution, and, allergic, diseases, children, living, in, poor, urban, areas, in, the, united, states, now, have, an, increased, risk, of, morbidity, due, to, asthma, in, comparison, to, other, low, income, children, in, the, united, states, in, addition, children, with, croup, living, in, urban, areas, have, higher, hazard, ratios, for, asthma, than, similar, children, living, in, rural, areas, researchers, suggest, that, this, difference, in, hazard, ratios, is, due, to, the, higher, levels, of, air, pollution, and, exposure, to, environmental, allergens, found, in, urban, areas, exposure, to, elevated, levels, of, ambient, air, pollutants, such, as, nitrogen, dioxide, no, 2, carbon, monoxide, co, and, particulate, matter, with, a, diameter, of, less, than, 2, 5, micrometres, pm, 2, 5, can, cause, dna, methylation, of, cpg, sites, in, immune, cells, which, increases, children, s, risk, of, developing, asthma, studies, have, shown, a, positive, correlation, between, foxp3, methylation, and, children, s, exposure, to, no, 2, co, and, pm, 2, 5, furthermore, any, amount, of, exposure, to, high, levels, of, air, pollution, have, shown, long, term, effects, on, the, foxp3, region, despite, the, increase, in, access, to, health, services, that, usually, accompanies, urbanization, the, rise, in, population, density, negatively, affects, air, quality, ultimately, mitigating, the, positive, value, of, health, resources, as, more, children, and, young, adults, develop, asthma, due, to, high, pollution, rates, however, urban, planning, as, well, as, emission, control, can, lessen, the, effects, of, traffic, related, air, pollution, on, allergic, diseases, such, as, asthma, historically, crime, and, urbanization, have, gone, hand, in, hand, the, simplest, explanation, is, that, areas, with, a, higher, population, density, are, surrounded, by, greater, availability, of, goods, committing, crimes, in, urbanized, areas, is, also, more, feasible, modernization, has, led, to, more, crime, as, well, as, the, modern, media, has, raised, greater, awareness, of, the, income, gap, between, the, rich, and, the, poor, this, leads, to, feelings, of, deprivation, which, in, turn, can, lead, to, crime, in, some, regions, where, urbanization, happens, in, wealthier, areas, a, rise, in, property, crime, and, a, decrease, in, violent, crime, is, seen, data, shows, that, there, is, an, increase, in, crime, in, urbanized, areas, some, factors, include, per, capita, income, income, inequality, and, overall, population, size, there, is, also, a, smaller, association, between, unemployment, rate, police, expenditures, and, crime, the, presence, of, crime, also, has, the, ability, to, produce, more, crime, these, areas, have, less, social, cohesion, and, therefore, less, social, control, this, is, evident, in, the, geographical, regions, that, crime, occurs, in, as, most, crime, tends, to, cluster, in, city, centres, the, further, the, distance, from, the, centre, of, the, city, the, lower, the, occurrence, of, crimes, are, migration, is, also, a, factor, that, can, increase, crime, in, urbanized, areas, people, from, one, area, are, displaced, and, forced, to, move, into, an, urbanized, society, here, they, are, in, a, new, environment, with, new, norms, and, social, values, this, can, lead, to, less, social, cohesion, and, more, crime, although, urbanization, tends, to, produce, more, negative, effects, one, positive, effect, that, urbanization, has, impacted, is, an, increase, in, physical, activity, in, comparison, to, rural, areas, residents, of, rural, areas, and, communities, in, the, united, states, have, higher, rates, of, obesity, and, engage, in, less, physical, activity, than, urban, residents, rural, residents, consume, a, higher, percent, of, fat, calories, and, are, less, likely, to, meet, the, guidelines, for, physical, activity, and, more, likely, to, be, physically, inactive, in, comparison, to, regions, within, the, united, states, the, west, has, the, lowest, prevalence, of, physical, inactivity, and, the, south, has, the, highest, prevalence, of, physical, inactivity, metropolitan, and, large, urban, areas, across, all, regions, have, the, highest, prevalence, of, physical, activity, among, residents, barriers, such, as, geographic, isolation, busy, and, unsafe, roads, and, social, stigmas, lead, to, decreased, physical, activity, in, rural, environments, faster, speed, limits, on, rural, roads, prohibits, the, ability, to, have, bike, lanes, sidewalks, footpaths, and, shoulders, along, the, side, of, the, roads, less, developed, open, spaces, in, rural, areas, like, parks, and, trails, suggest, that, there, is, lower, walkability, in, these, areas, in, comparison, to, urban, areas, many, residents, in, rural, settings, have, to, travel, long, distances, to, utilize, exercise, facilities, taking, up, too, much, time, in, the, day, and, deterring, residents, from, using, recreational, facilities, to, obtain, physical, activity, additionally, residents, of, rural, communities, are, traveling, further, for, work, decreasing, the, amount, of, time, that, can, be, spent, on, leisure, physical, activity, and, significantly, decreases, the, opportunity, to, partake, in, active, transportation, to, work, neighbourhoods, and, communities, with, nearby, fitness, venues, a, common, feature, of, urbanization, have, residents, that, partake, in, increased, amounts, of, physical, activity, communities, with, sidewalks, street, lights, and, traffic, signals, have, residents, participating, in, more, physical, activity, than, communities, without, those, features, having, a, variety, of, destinations, close, to, where, people, live, increases, the, use, of, active, transportation, such, as, walking, and, biking, active, transportation, is, also, enhanced, in, urban, communities, where, there, is, easy, access, to, public, transportation, due, to, residents, walking, or, biking, to, transportation, stops, in, a, study, comparing, different, regions, in, the, united, states, opinions, across, all, areas, were, shared, that, environmental, characteristics, like, access, to, sidewalks, safe, roads, recreational, facilities, and, enjoyable, scenery, are, positively, associated, with, participation, in, leisure, physical, activity, perceiving, that, resources, are, nearby, for, physical, activity, increases, the, likelihood, that, residents, of, all, communities, will, meet, the, guidelines, and, recommendations, for, appropriate, physical, activity, specific, to, rural, residents, the, safety, of, outdoor, developed, spaces, and, convenient, availability, to, recreational, facilities, matters, most, when, making, decisions, on, increasing, physical, activity, in, order, to, combat, the, levels, of, inactivity, in, rural, residents, more, convenient, recreational, features, such, as, the, ones, discussed, in, this, paragraph, need, to, be, implemented, into, rural, communities, and, societies, urbanization, factors, that, contribute, to, mental, health, can, be, thought, of, as, factors, that, affect, the, individual, and, factors, that, affect, the, larger, social, group, at, the, macro, social, group, level, changes, related, to, urbanization, are, thought, to, contribute, to, social, disintegration, and, disorganization, these, macro, factors, contribute, to, social, disparities, which, affect, individuals, by, creating, perceived, insecurity, perceived, insecurity, can, be, due, problems, with, the, physical, environment, such, as, issues, with, personal, safety, or, problems, with, the, social, environment, such, as, a, loss, of, positive, self, concepts, from, negative, events, increased, stress, is, a, common, individual, psychological, stressor, that, accompanies, urbanization, and, is, thought, to, be, due, to, perceived, insecurity, changes, in, social, organization, a, consequence, of, urbanization, are, thought, to, lead, to, reduced, social, support, increased, violence, and, overcrowding, it, is, these, factors, that, are, thought, to, contribute, to, increased, stress, a, 2004, study, of, 4, 4, million, swedish, residents, found, that, people, who, live, in, cities, have, a, 20, increased, chance, of, developing, depression, different, forms, of, urbanization, can, be, classified, depending, on, the, style, of, architecture, and, planning, methods, as, well, as, the, historic, growth, of, areas, in, cities, of, the, developed, world, urbanization, traditionally, exhibited, a, concentration, of, human, activities, and, settlements, around, the, downtown, area, the, so, called, in, migration, in, migration, refers, to, migration, from, former, colonies, and, similar, places, the, fact, that, many, immigrants, settle, in, impoverished, city, centres, led, to, the, notion, of, the, peripheralization, of, the, core, which, simply, describes, that, people, who, used, to, be, at, the, periphery, of, the, former, empires, now, live, right, in, the, centre, recent, developments, such, as, inner, city, redevelopment, schemes, mean, that, new, arrivals, in, cities, no, longer, necessarily, settle, in, the, centre, in, some, developed, regions, the, reverse, effect, originally, called, counter, urbanization, has, occurred, with, cities, losing, population, to, rural, areas, and, is, particularly, common, for, richer, families, this, has, been, possible, because, of, improved, communications, and, has, been, caused, by, factors, such, as, the, fear, of, crime, and, poor, urban, environments, it, has, contributed, to, the, phenomenon, of, shrinking, cities, experienced, by, some, parts, of, the, industrialized, world, rural, migrants, are, attracted, by, the, possibilities, that, cities, can, offer, but, often, settle, in, shanty, towns, and, experience, extreme, poverty, the, inability, of, countries, to, provide, adequate, housing, for, these, rural, migrants, is, related, to, overurbanization, a, phenomenon, in, which, the, rate, of, urbanization, grows, more, rapidly, than, the, rate, of, economic, development, leading, to, high, unemployment, and, high, demand, for, resources, in, the, 1980s, this, was, attempted, to, be, tackled, with, the, urban, bias, theory, which, was, promoted, by, michael, lipton, most, of, the, urban, poor, in, developing, countries, unable, to, find, work, can, spend, their, lives, in, insecure, poorly, paid, jobs, according, to, research, by, the, overseas, development, institute, pro, poor, urbanization, will, require, labour, intensive, growth, supported, by, labour, protection, flexible, land, use, regulation, and, investments, in, basic, services, when, the, residential, area, shifts, outward, this, is, called, suburbanization, a, number, of, researchers, and, writers, suggest, that, suburbanization, has, gone, so, far, to, form, new, points, of, concentration, outside, the, downtown, both, in, developed, and, developing, countries, such, as, india, this, networked, poly, centric, form, of, concentration, is, considered, by, some, emerging, pattern, of, urbanization, it, is, called, variously, edge, city, garreau, 1991, network, city, batten, 1995, postmodern, city, dear, 2000, or, exurb, though, the, latter, term, now, refers, to, a, less, dense, area, beyond, the, suburbs, los, angeles, is, the, best, known, example, of, this, type, of, urbanization, in, the, united, states, this, process, has, reversed, as, of, 2011, with, re, urbanization, occurring, as, suburban, flight, due, to, chronically, high, transport, costs, michael, lipton, author, of, urban, bias, theory, urbanization, can, be, planned, urbanization, or, organic, planned, urbanization, i, e, planned, community, or, the, garden, city, movement, is, based, on, an, advance, plan, which, can, be, prepared, for, military, aesthetic, economic, or, urban, design, reasons, examples, can, be, seen, in, many, ancient, cities, although, with, exploration, came, the, collision, of, nations, which, meant, that, many, invaded, cities, took, on, the, desired, planned, characteristics, of, their, occupiers, many, ancient, organic, cities, experienced, redevelopment, for, military, and, economic, purposes, new, roads, carved, through, the, cities, and, new, parcels, of, land, were, cordoned, off, serving, various, planned, purposes, giving, cities, distinctive, geometric, designs, un, agencies, prefer, to, see, urban, infrastructure, installed, before, urbanization, occurs, landscape, planners, are, responsible, for, landscape, infrastructure, public, parks, sustainable, urban, drainage, systems, greenways, etc, which, can, be, planned, before, urbanization, takes, place, or, afterwards, to, revitalize, an, area, and, create, greater, livability, within, a, region, concepts, of, control, of, the, urban, expansion, are, considered, in, the, american, institute, of, planners, as, population, continues, to, grow, and, urbanize, at, unprecedented, rates, new, urbanism, and, smart, growth, techniques, are, implemented, to, create, a, transition, into, developing, environmentally, economically, and, socially, sustainable, cities, additionally, a, more, well, rounded, approach, articulates, the, importance, to, promote, participation, of, non, state, actors, which, could, include, businesses, research, and, non, profit, organizations, and, most, importantly, local, citizens, smart, growth, and, new, urbanism, s, principles, include, walkability, mixed, use, development, comfortable, high, density, design, land, conservation, social, equity, and, economic, diversity, mixed, use, communities, work, to, fight, gentrification, with, affordable, housing, to, promote, social, equity, decrease, automobile, dependency, to, lower, use, of, fossil, fuels, and, promote, a, localized, economy, walkable, communities, have, a, 38, higher, average, gdp, per, capita, than, less, walkable, urban, metros, leinberger, lynch, by, combining, economic, environmental, and, social, sustainability, cities, will, become, equitable, resilient, and, more, appealing, than, urban, sprawl, that, overuses, land, promotes, automobile, use, and, segregates, the, population, economically, presently, most, countries, in, the, world, are, urbanized, with, the, global, urbanization, average, numbering, 56, 2, in, 2020, however, there, are, great, differences, between, some, regions, the, nations, of, europe, the, middle, east, the, americas, and, east, asia, are, predominantly, urbanized, meanwhile, two, large, belts, from, central, to, eastern, africa, and, from, central, to, southeast, asia, of, very, lowly, urbanized, countries, exist, as, seen, on, the, map, here, these, labeled, countries, are, among, the, least, urbanized
