word, shijiazhuang, was, generally, used, after, construction, of, the, shijiazhuang, station, of, the, zhengtai, railway, in, 1907, the, origin, of, the, name, is, heavily, disputed, one, story, claimed, that, the, wanli, emperor, sent, 24, officers, and, their, families, to, the, area, after, which, the, group, splits, into, two, settlements, consisting, of, 10, and, 14, families, the, imperial, court, then, named, the, settlements, village, of, 10, families, and, village, of, 14, families, respectively, since, the, chinese, characters, for, ten, sh, and, stone, sh, are, homophones, it, is, speculated, that, the, city, name, gradually, evolved, into, its, current, spelling, another, explanation, is, that, the, settlement, was, named, after, the, highest, ranking, official, amongst, the, groups, who, was, surnamed, shi, however, a, county, named, shiyi, chinese, lit, stone, city, in, present, day, luquan, district, was, already, present, during, the, warring, states,
