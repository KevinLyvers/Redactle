plain, desert, the, name, of, california, existed, as, a, myth, among, european, explorers, before, it, was, discovered, the, earliest, known, mention, of, the, idea, of, california, was, in, the, 1510, romance, novel, las, sergas, de, esplandi, n, by, spanish, author, garci, rodr, guez, de, montalvo, the, book, described, the, island, of, california, as, being, west, of, the, indies, very, close, to, the, side, of, the, terrestrial, paradise, and, it, is, peopled, by, black, women, without, any, man, among, them, for, they, live, in, the, manner, of, amazons, the, baja, peninsula, was, originally, believed, by, the, first, spanish, sea, explorers, to, be, an, island, and, acquired, the, name, california, after, the, mythical, paradise, following, hern, n, cort, s, s, conquest, of, mexico, the, search, for, the, fabled, strait, of, ani, n, connecting, the, atlantic, to, the, pacific, helped, motivate, him, to, send, several, expeditions, to, the, west, coast, of, new, spain, in, the, 1530s, and, early, 1540s, in, 1539, explorer, francisco, de, ulloa, proved, that, baja, california, was, a, peninsula, rather, than, an, island, and, named, the, water, separating, it, from, the, mainland, the, vermillion, sea, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, red, sea, the, spaniards, gave, the, name, las, californias, to, the, peninsula, and, lands, to, the, north, including, both, baja, california, and, alta, california, the, region, that, became, parts, of, the, present, day, u, s, states, of, california, nevada, utah, arizona, and, parts, of, colorado, and, wyoming, over, time, the, name, sea, of, cortez, replaced, vermillion, sea, and, today, the, term, gulf, of, california, is, used, by, some, although, cartographers, such, as, abraham, ortelius, showed, the, baja, as, an, extensive, peninsula, in, his, theatrum, orbis, terrarum, published, in, antwerpen, in, 1589, and, on, the, map, maris, pacifici, from, 1589, in, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, the, idea, of, california, as, an, island, spread, again, this, persisted, well, into, the, 18th, century, and, was, included, in, many, erroneous, maps, that, did, not, have, the, knowledge, of, the, spanish, sailors, about, the, pacific, coast, of, north, america, it, is, believed, to, have, originated, with, carmelite, friar, antonio, ascension, who, around, 1620, drew, a, map, of, california, depicting, it, as, an, island, supposedly, on, a, misconception, of, reports, by, spanish, navigators, juan, de, fuca, and, martin, d, aquilar, a, copy, of, this, map, was, sent, to, spain, and, was, seized, by, the, dutch, on, its, way, and, then, reproduced, in, the, netherlands, and, eventually, found, its, way, to, henry, briggs, in, london, who, widely, disseminated, this, misinformation, the, first, printed, map, showing, california, as, an, island, was, published, by, briggs, in, 1622, this, map, was, also, included, in, hakluytus, posthumus, by, samuel, purchas, 1625, where, it, was, written, that, it, was, sometimes, supposed, to, be, a, peninsula, but, had, since, been, shown, by, the, dutch, to, be, an, island, the, idea, was, warmly, accepted, by, cartographers, and, presented, even, in, c, 1720, on, carte, nouveelle, de, la, mer, du, sud, published, in, amsterdam, by, andries, and, hendrik, de, leth, garcia, and, jorge, opined, in, 2023, that, a, reason, for, such, a, mistake, could, have, originated, in, the, secret, in, which, the, spaniards, held, their, cartography, from, other, european, powers, eyes, the, final, blow, to, the, notion, of, california, as, an, island, was, struck, by, an, influential, map, created, by, italian, jesuit, priest, eusebio, kino, during, his, mission, in, the, pimer, a, alta, it, was, titled, paso, por, tierra, a, la, california, y, sus, confinantes, nuevas, naciones, y, misiones, nuevas, de, la, compa, a, de, jhs, en, la, am, rica, septentrional, overland, passage, to, california, and, its, contiguous, new, nations, and, new, missions, of, the, society, of, jesus, in, northern, america, originally, in, 1695, it, depicted, california, as, a, peninsula, but, based, on, the, presence, of, blue, abalone, shells, most, likely,

was, printed, in, 1707, in, hamburg, and, leipzig, and, became, one, of, the, best, known, maps, of, northern, new, spain, a, notable, colleague, of, eusebio, kino, who, accompanied, him, on, one, of, his, major, travels, in, 1694, and, acted, as, the, intermediary, in, the, publication, of, this, map, and, dissemination, of, kino, s, knowledge, in, europe, was, carniolan, priest, marcus, antonius,
