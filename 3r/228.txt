the, mariana, trench, is, an, oceanic, trench, located, in, the, western, pacific, ocean, about, 200, kilometres, 124, mi, east, of, the, mariana, islands, it, is, the, deepest, oceanic, trench, on, earth, it, is, crescent, shaped, and, measures, about, 2, 550, km, 1, 580, mi, in, length, and, 69, km, 43, mi, in, width, the, maximum, known, depth, is, 10, 984, 25, metres, 36, 037, 82, ft, 6, 006, 14, fathoms, 6, 825, 0, 016, mi, at, the, southern, end, of, a, small, slot, shaped, valley, in, its, floor, known, as, the, challenger, deep, the, deepest, point, of, the, trench, is, more, than, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, farther, from, sea, level, than, the, peak, of, mount, everest, at, the, bottom, of, the, trench, the, water, column, above, exerts, a, pressure, of, 1, 086, bar, 15, 750, psi, more, than, 1, 071, times, the, standard, atmospheric, pressure, at, sea, level, at, this, pressure, the, density, of, water, is, increased, by, 4, 96, the, temperature, at, the, bottom, is, 1, to, 4, c, 34, to, 39, f, in, 2009, the, mariana, trench, was, established, as, a, us, national, monument, one, celled, organisms, called, monothalamea, have, been, found, in, the, trench, at, a, record, depth, of, 10, 6, km, 35, 000, ft, 6, 6, mi, below, the, sea, surface, by, researchers, from, scripps, institution, of, oceanography, data, has, also, suggested, that, microbial, life, forms, thrive, within, the, trench, the, mariana, trench, is, named, after, the, nearby, mariana, islands, which, are, named, las, marianas, in, honor, of, spanish, queen, mariana, of, austria, the, islands, are, part, of, the, island, arc, that, is, formed, on, an, over, riding, plate, called, the, mariana, plate, also, named, for, the, islands, on, the, western, side, of, the, trench, the, mariana, trench, is, part, of, the, izu, bonin, mariana, subduction, system, that, forms, the, boundary, between, two, tectonic, plates, in, this, system, the, western, edge, of, one, plate, the, pacific, plate, is, subducted, i, e, thrust, beneath, the, smaller, mariana, plate, that, lies, to, the, west, crustal, material, at, the, western, edge, of, the, pacific, plate, is, some, of, the, oldest, oceanic, crust, on, earth, up, to, 170, million, years, old, and, is, therefore, cooler, and, denser, hence, its, great, height, difference, relative, to, the, higher, riding, and, younger, mariana, plate, the, deepest, area, at, the, plate, boundary, is, the, mariana, trench, proper, the, movement, of, the, pacific, and, mariana, plates, is, also, indirectly, responsible, for, the, formation, of, the, mariana, islands, these, volcanic, islands, are, caused, by, flux, melting, of, the, upper, mantle, due, to, the, release, of, water, that, is, trapped, in, minerals, of, the, subducted, portion, of, the, pacific, plate, the, trench, was, first, sounded, during, the, challenger, expedition, in, 1875, using, a, weighted, rope, which, recorded, a, depth, of, 4, 475, fathoms, 8, 184, metres, 26, 850, feet, in, 1877, a, map, was, published, called, tiefenkarte, des, grossen, ozeans, depth, map, of, the, great, ocean, by, petermann, which, showed, a, challenger, tief, challenger, deep, at, the, location, of, that, sounding, in, 1899, uss, nero, a, converted, collier, recorded, a, depth, of, 5, 269, fathoms, 9, 636, metres, 31, 614, feet, in, 1951, under, chief, scientist, thomas, gaskell, challenger, ii, surveyed, the, trench, using, echo, sounding, a, much, more, precise, and, vastly, easier, way, to, measure, depth, than, the, sounding, equipment, and, drag, lines, used, in, the, original, expedition, during, this, survey, the, deepest, part, of, the, trench, was, recorded, when, the, challenger, ii, measured, a, depth, of, 5, 960, fathoms, 10, 900, metres, 35, 760, feet, at, 11, 19, n, 142, 15, e, 11, 317, n, 142, 250, e, 11, 317, 142, 250, known, as, the, challenger, deep, in, 1957, the, soviet, vessel, vityaz, reported, a, depth, of, 11, 034, m, 36, 201, ft, 6, 033, fathoms, at, a, location, dubbed, the, mariana, hollow, in, 1962, the, surface, ship, m, v, spencer, f, baird, recorded, a, maximum, depth, of, 10, 915, m, 35, 810, ft, 5, 968, fathoms, using, precision, depth, gauges, in, 1984, the, japanese, survey, vessel, takuy, collected, data, from, the, mariana, trench, using, a, narrow, multi, beam, echo, sounder, it, reported, a, maximum, depth, of, 10, 924, metres, 35, 840, ft, also, reported, as, 10, 920, 10, m, 35, 827, 33, ft, 5, 971, 1, 5, 5, fathoms, remotely, operated, vehicle, kaiko, reached, the, deepest, area, of, the, mariana, trench, and, made, the, deepest, diving, record, of, 10, 911, m, 35, 797, ft, 5, 966, fathoms, on, 24, march, 1995, during, surveys, carried, out, between, 1997, and, 2001, a, spot, was, found, along, the, mariana, trench, that, had, a, depth, similar, to, the, challenger, deep, possibly, even, deeper, it, was, discovered, while, scientists, from, the, hawaii, institute, of, geophysics, and, planetology, were, completing, a, survey, around, guam, they, used, a, sonar, mapping, system, towed, behind, the, research, ship, to, conduct, the, survey, this, new, spot, was, named, the, hmrg, hawaii, mapping, research, group, deep, after, the, group, of, scientists, who, discovered, it, on, 1, june, 2009, mapping, aboard, the, rv, kilo, moana, mothership, of, the, nereus, vehicle, indicated, a, spot, with, a, depth, of, 10, 971, m, 35, 994, ft, 5, 999, fathoms, the, sonar, mapping, of, the, challenger, deep, was, possible, by, its, simrad, em120, sonar, multibeam, bathymetry, system, for, deep, water, the, sonar, system, uses, phase, and, amplitude, bottom, detection, with, an, accuracy, of, better, than, 0, 2, of, water, depth, across, the, entire, swath, implying, that, the, depth, figure, is, accurate, to, 22, metres, 72, ft, 12, fathoms, in, 2011, it, was, announced, at, the, american, geophysical, union, fall, meeting, that, a, us, navy, hydrographic, ship, equipped, with, a, multibeam, echosounder, conducted, a, survey, which, mapped, the, entire, trench, to, 100, m, 330, ft, 55, fathoms, resolution, the, mapping, revealed, the, existence, of, four, rocky, outcrops, thought, to, be, former, seamounts, the, mariana, trench, is, a, site, chosen, by, researchers, at, washington, university, in, st, louis, and, the, woods, hole, oceanographic, institution, in, 2012, for, a, seismic, survey, to, investigate, the, subsurface, water, cycle, using, both, ocean, bottom, seismometers, and, hydrophones, the, scientists, are, able, to, map, structures, as, deep, as, 97, kilometres, 318, 000, ft, 53, 000, fathoms, 60, mi, beneath, the, surface, as, of, 2022, 22, crewed, descents, and, seven, uncrewed, descents, have, been, achieved, the, first, was, the, crewed, descent, by, swiss, designed, italian, built, united, states, navy, owned, bathyscaphe, trieste, which, reached, the, bottom, at, 1, 06, pm, on, 23, january, 1960, with, don, walsh, and, jacques, piccard, on, board, iron, shot, was, used, for, ballast, with, gasoline, for, buoyancy, the, onboard, systems, indicated, a, depth, of, 37, 800, feet, 11, 521, m, 6, 300, fathoms, but, this, was, later, revised, to, 35, 814, feet, 10, 916, m, 5, 969, fathoms, the, depth, was, estimated, from, a, conversion, of, pressure, measured, and, calculations, based, on, the, water, density, from, sea, surface, to, seabed, this, was, followed, by, the, uncrewed, rovs, kaik, in, 1996, and, nereus, in, 2009, the, first, three, expeditions, directly, measured, very, similar, depths, of, 10, 902, to, 10, 916, m, 35, 768, to, 35, 814, ft, 5, 961, to, 5, 969, fathoms, the, fourth, was, made, by, canadian, film, director, james, cameron, on, 26, march, 2012, he, reached, the, bottom, of, the, mariana, trench, in, the, submersible, vessel, deepsea, challenger, diving, to, a, depth, of, 10, 908, m, 35, 787, ft, 5, 965, fathoms, in, july, 2015, members, of, the, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, oregon, state, university, and, the, coast, guard, submerged, a, hydrophone, into, the, deepest, part, of, the, mariana, trench, the, challenger, deep, never, having, previously, deployed, one, past, a, mile, the, titanium, shelled, hydrophone, was, designed, to, withstand, the, immense, pressure, 7, mi, 37, 000, ft, 6, 200, fathoms, 11, 000, m, under, although, researchers, were, unable, to, retrieve, the, hydrophone, until, november, the, data, capacity, was, full, within, the, first, 23, days, after, months, of, analyzing, the, sounds, the, experts, were, surprised, to, pick, up, natural, sounds, like, earthquakes, typhoons, baleen, whales, and, machine, made, sounds, such, as, boats, due, to, the, mission, s, success, the, researchers, announced, plans, to, deploy, a, second, hydrophone, in, 2017, for, an, extended, period, of, time, victor, vescovo, achieved, a, new, record, descent, to, 10, 928, m, 35, 853, ft, 5, 976, fathoms, on, 28, april, 2019, using, the, dsv, limiting, factor, a, triton, 36000, 2, model, manufactured, by, florida, based, triton, submarines, he, dived, four, times, between, 28, april, and, 5, may, 2019, becoming, the, first, person, to, dive, into, challenger, deep, more, than, once, on, 8, may, 2020, a, joint, project, between, the, russian, shipbuilders, scientific, teams, of, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, with, the, support, of, the, russian, foundation, for, advanced, research, projects, and, the, pacific, fleet, submerged, the, autonomous, underwater, vehicle, vityaz, d, to, the, bottom, of, the, mariana, trench, at, a, depth, of, 10, 028, m, 32, 900, ft, 5, 483, fathoms, vityaz, d, is, the, first, underwater, vehicle, to, operate, autonomously, at, the, extreme, depths, of, the, mariana, trench, the, duration, of, the, mission, excluding, diving, and, surfacing, was, more, than, 3, hours, on, 10, november, 2020, the, chinese, submersible, fendouzhe, reached, the, bottom, of, the, mariana, trench, at, a, depth, of, 10, 909, m, 35, 791, ft, 5, 965, fathoms, the, expedition, conducted, in, 1960, claimed, to, have, observed, with, great, surprise, because, of, the, high, pressure, large, creatures, living, at, the, bottom, such, as, a, flatfish, about, 30, cm, 12, in, long, and, shrimp, according, to, piccard, the, bottom, appeared, light, and, clear, a, waste, of, firm, diatomaceous, ooze, many, marine, biologists, are, now, skeptical, of, the, supposed, sighting, of, the, flatfish, and, it, is, suggested, that, the, creature, may, instead, have, been, a, sea, cucumber, during, the, second, expedition, the, uncrewed, vehicle, kaik, collected, mud, samples, from, the, seabed, tiny, organisms, were, found, to, be, living, in, those, samples, in, july, 2011, a, research, expedition, deployed, untethered, landers, called, drop, cams, equipped, with, digital, video, cameras, and, lights, to, explore, this, deep, sea, region, among, many, other, living, organisms, some, gigantic, single, celled, foraminiferans, with, a, size, of, more, than, 10, cm, 4, in, belonging, to, the, class, of, monothalamea, were, observed, monothalamea, are, noteworthy, for, their, size, their, extreme, abundance, on, the, seafloor, and, their, role, as, hosts, for, a, variety, of, organisms, in, december, 2014, a, new, species, of, snailfish, was, discovered, at, a, depth, of, 8, 145, m, 26, 722, ft, 4, 454, fathoms, breaking, the, previous, record, for, the, deepest, living, fish, seen, on, video, during, the, 2014, expedition, several, new, species, were, filmed, including, huge, amphipods, known, as, supergiants, deep, sea, gigantism, is, the, process, where, species, grow, larger, than, their, shallow, water, relatives, in, may, 2017, an, unidentified, type, of, snailfish, was, filmed, at, a, depth, of, 8, 178, metres, 26, 800, ft, in, 2016, a, research, expedition, looked, at, the, chemical, makeup, of, crustacean, scavengers, collected, from, the, range, of, 7, 841, 10, 250, m, 25, 725, 33, 629, ft, 4, 288, 5, 605, fathoms, within, the, trench, within, these, organisms, the, researchers, found, extremely, elevated, concentrations, of, pcbs, a, chemical, toxin, banned, in, the, 1970s, for, its, environmental, harm, concentrated, at, all, depths, within, the, sediment, of, the, trench, further, research, has, found, that, amphipods, also, ingest, microplastics, with, 100, of, amphipods, having, at, least, one, piece, of, synthetic, material, in, their, stomachs, in, 2019, victor, vescovo, reported, finding, a, plastic, bag, and, candy, wrappers, at, the, bottom, of, the, trench, that, year, scientific, american, also, reported, that, carbon, 14, from, nuclear, bomb, testing, has, been, found, in, the, bodies, of, aquatic, animals, found, in, the, trench, like, other, oceanic, trenches, the, mariana, trench, has, been, proposed, as, a, site, for, nuclear, waste, disposal, in, the, hope, that, tectonic, plate, subduction, occurring, at, the, site, might, eventually, push, the, nuclear, waste, deep, into, the, earth, s, mantle, the, second, layer, of, the, earth, in, 1979, japan, planned, to, dump, low, level, nuclear, wastes, near, maug, in, the, northern, marianas, however, ocean, dumping, of, nuclear, waste, is, prohibited, by, international, law, furthermore, plate, subduction, zones, are, associated, with, very, large, megathrust, earthquakes, the, effects, of, which, are, unpredictable, for, the, safety, of, long, term, disposal, of, nuclear, wastes, within, the, hadopelagic, ecosystem, 11, 21, n, 142, 12, e, 11, 350, n, 142, 200, e, 11, 350, 142, 200
