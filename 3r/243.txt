who, were, enslaved, from, the, thirteen, colonies, the, archipelago, s, limited, land, area, and, resources, led, to, the, creation, of, what, may, be, the, earliest, conservation, laws, of, the,

retained, the, status, quo, in, bermuda, in, the, 17th, century, the, somers, isles, company, suppressed, shipbuilding, as, it, needed, bermudians, to, farm, in, order, to, generate, income, from, the, land, the, virginia, colony, however, far, surpassed, bermuda, in, quality, and, quantity, of, tobacco, produced, bermudians, began, to, turn, to, maritime, trades, relatively, early, in, the, 17th, century, but, the, somers, isles, company, used, all, its, authority, to, suppress, turning, away, from, agriculture, this, interference, led, to, islanders, demanding, and, receiving, revocation, of, the, company, s, charter, in, 1684, and, the, company, was, dissolved, bermudians, rapidly, abandoned, agriculture, for, shipbuilding, replanting, farmland, with, the, native, juniper, trees, juniperus, bermudiana, called, bermuda, cedar, establishing, effective, control, over, the, turks, islands, bermudians, deforested, their, landscape, to, begin, the, salt, trade, it, became, the, world, s, largest, and, remained, the, cornerstone, of, bermuda, s, economy, for, the, next, century, bermudians, also, vigorously, pursued, whaling, privateering, and, the, merchant, trade, some, islanders, especially, in, st, david, s, still, trace, their, ancestry, to, native, americans, and, many, more, are, ignorant, of, having, such, ancestry, hundreds, of, native, americans, were, shipped, to, bermuda, the, best, known, examples, were, the, algonquian, peoples, such, as, pequots, wampanoags, podunks, nipmucks, narragansetts, who, were, exiled, from, the, new, england, colonies, and, sold, into, slavery, in, the, seventeenth, century, notably, in, the, aftermaths, of, the, pequot, war, and, king, philip, s, war, but, some, are, believed, to, have, been, brought, from, as, far, away, as, mexico, bermuda, s, ambivalence, towards, the, american, rebellion, changed, in, september, 1774, when, the, continental, congress, resolved, to, ban, trade, with, great, britain,

taken, from, the, bermudian, magazine, while, governor, george, james, bruere, slept, and, loaded, onto, these, boats, as, a, consequence, on, 2, october, the, continental, congress, exempted, bermuda, from, their, trade, ban, and, bermuda, acquired, a, reputation, for, disloyalty, later, that, year, the, british, parliament, passed, the, prohibitory, act, to, prohibit, trade, with, the, american, rebelling, colonies, and, sent, hms, scorpion, to, keep, watch, over, the, island, the, island, s, forts, were, stripped, of, cannons, yet, wartime, trade, of, contraband, continued, along,

that, led, to, the, passing, of, the, commonwealth, immigrants, act, 1962, which, restricted, the, rights, of, commonwealth, nationals, to, enter, reside, and, work, in, the, united, kingdom, this, act, also, allowed, certain, colonials, primarily, ethnic, indians, in, african, colonies, to, retain, citizenship, of, the, united, kingdom, and, colonies, if, their, colonies, became, independent,

from, former, african, colonies, notably, kenya, subsequently, relocated, to, the, united, kingdom, in, response, to, which, the, commonwealth, immigrants, act, 1968, was, rapidly, passed, stripping, all, british, subjects, including, citizens, of, the, united, kingdom, and, colonies, who, were, not, born, in, the, united, kingdom, and, who, did, not, have, a, citizen, of, the, united, kingdom, and, colonies, parent, or, grandparent, born, in, the, united, kingdom, or, some, other, qualification, such, as, existing, residence, status, of, the, rights, to, freely, enter, reside, and, work, in, the, united, kingdom, although, the, 1968, act, was, intended, primarily, to, bar, immigration, of, specific, british, passport, holders, from, commonwealth, countries, in, africa, it, amended, the, wording, of, the, commonwealth, immigrants, act, 1962, in, such, a, way, as, to, apply, to, all, citizens, of, the, united, kingdom, and, colonies, who, were, not, specifically, excepted, including, most, colonials, this, was, followed, by, the, immigration, act, 1971, which, effectively, divided, citizens, of, the, united, kingdom, and, colonies, into, two, types, although, their, citizenship, remained, the, same, patrials, who, were, those, from, or, with, a, specified, qualifying, connection, to, the, united, kingdom, itself, who, retained, the, rights, of, free, entry, abode, and, work, in, the, united, kingdom, and, those, born, in, the, colonies, or, in, foreign, countries, to, british, colonial, parents, from, whom, those, rights, were, denied, the, british, nationality, act, 1981, which, entered, into, force, on, 1, january, 1983, abolished, british, subject, status, and, stripped, colonials, of, their, full, british, citizenship, of, the, united, kingdom, and, colonies, replacing, it, with, british, dependent, territories, citizenship, which, entailed, no, right, of, abode, or, to, work, anywhere, this, left, bermudians, and, most, other, erstwhile, british, colonials, as, british, nationals, without, the, rights, of, british, citizenship, the, exceptions, were, the, gibraltarians, permitted, to, retain, british, citizenship, in, order, to, also, retain, citizenship, of, the, european, union, and, the, falkland, islanders, who, were, permitted, to, retain, the, same, new, british, citizenship, that, became, the, default, citizenship, for, those, from, the, united, kingdom, and, the, crown, dependencies, the, stripping, of, citizens, birthrights, from, bermudians, by, the, british, government, in, 1968, and, 1971, and,

1966, the, bermuda, police, force, as, it, was, then, titled, began, also, recruiting, constables, from, british, west, indian, police, forces, starting, with, seven, constables, from, barbados,

bermudian, newspapers, the, royal, gazette, and, the, bermuda, sun, showed, that, clear, majorities, of, bermudians, were, opposed, to, joining, caricom, the, ubp, which, had, been, in, government, from, 1968, to, 1998, argued, that, joining, caricom, was, detrimental, to, bermuda, s, interests, in, that, law, enforcement, in, bermuda, is, provided, chiefly, by, the, bermuda, police, service, and, is, also, supported, with, the, customs, department, and, immigration, department, during, certain, times, the, royal, bermuda, regiment, can, be, called, in, to, assist, law, enforcement,
