government, buildings, as, well, as, the, national, library, of, libya, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, ancient, greeks, settled, on, the, site, of, benghazi, in, the, late, seventh, century, bc, they, called, the, city, euesperides, ancient, greek, and, hesperis, ancient, greek, euesperides, was, most, likely, founded, by, people, from, cyrene, or, barce, which, was, located, on, the, edge, of, a, lagoon, which, opened, from, the, sea, at, the, time, this, area, may, have, been, deep, enough, to, receive, small, sailing, vessels, the, name, was, attributed, to, the, fertility, of, the, neighborhood, which, gave, rise, to, the, mythological, associations, of, the, garden, of, the, hesperides, the, ancient, city, existed, on, a, raised, piece, of, land, opposite, of, what, is, now, the, sidi, abayd, graveyard, in, the, northern, benghazi, suburb, of, sbikhat, al, salmani, al, salmani, marsh, the, city, is, first, mentioned, by, ancient, sources, in, herodotus, account, of, the, revolt, of, barca, and, the, persian, expedition, to, cyrenaica, in, c, 515, bc, where, it, is, stated, that, the, punitive, force, sent, by, the, satrap, of, egypt, conquered, cyrenaica, as, far, west, as, euesperides, the, oldest, coins, minted, in, the, city, date, back, to, 480, bc, one, side, of, those, coins, has, an, engraving, of, delphi, the, other, side, is, an, engraving, of, a, silphium, plant, once, the, symbol, of, trade, from, cyrenaica, because, of, its, use, as, a, rich, seasoning, and, as, a, medicine, the, coinage, suggests, that, the, city, must, have, enjoyed, some, autonomy, from, cyrene, in, the, early, 5th, century, bc, when, the, issues, of, euesperides, had, their, own, types, with, the, legend, eu, es, distinct, from, those, of, cyrene, the, city, was, in, hostile, territory, and, was, surrounded, by, inhospitable, tribes, the, greek, historian, thucydides, mentions, a, siege, of, the, city, in, 414, bc, by, libyans, who, were, probably, the, nasamones, euesperides, was, saved, by, the, unexpected, arrival, of, the, spartan, general, gylippus, and, his, fleet, who, were, blown, to, libya, by, contrary, winds, on, their, way, to, sicily, one, of, the, cyrenean, kings, whose, fate, is, connected, with, the, city, is, arcesilaus, iv, the, king, used, his, chariot, victory, at, the, pythian, games, of, 462, bc, to, attract, new, settlers, to, euesperides, where, arcesilaus, hoped, to, create, a, safe, refuge, for, himself, against, the, resentment, of, the, people, of, cyrene, this, proved, ineffective, since, when, the, king, fled, to, euesperides, during, the, anticipated, revolution, around, 440, bc, he, was, assassinated, thus, terminating, the, almost, 200, year, rule, of, the, battiad, dynasty, an, inscription, found, there, and, dated, around, the, middle, of, the, 4th, century, bc, states, that, the, city, had, a, constitution, similar, to, that, of, cyrene, with, a, board, of, chief, magistrates, ephors, and, a, council, of, elders, gerontes, from, 324, to, 322, bc, the, city, supported, the, spartan, adventurer, thibron, who, attempted, to, establish, his, own, kingdom, in, cyrenaica, but, was, defeated, the, city, came, under, the, control, of, ptolemy, i, and, formed, part, of, the, breakaway, kingdom, of, magas, of, cyrene, after, 276, bc, in, 246, bc, during, the, power, struggle, following, magas, death, his, daughter, berenice, married, ptolemy, iii, bringing, the, region, back, under, ptolemaic, control, euesperides, was, relocated, to, a, new, site, underneath, benghazi, s, modern, city, centre, and, renamed, berenice, the, move, may, have, been, due, to, the, silting, up, of, the, lagoons, but, there, is, no, archaeological, evidence, for, economic, decline, in, the, preceding, period, and, it, is, more, likely, that, the, refoundation, was, punishment, for, having, opposed, berenice, and, ptolemy, s, assumption, of, power, modern, benghazi, on, the, gulf, of, sidra, lies, a, little, southwest, of, the, site, of, the, ancient, greek, city, of, berenice, or, berenicis, or, bernici, that, city, was, traditionally, founded, in, 446, bc, different, sources, give, different,
