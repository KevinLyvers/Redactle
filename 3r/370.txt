the, atlas, mountains, are, a, mountain, range, in, the, maghreb, in, north, africa, it, separates, the, sahara, desert, from, the, mediterranean, sea, and, the, atlantic, ocean, the, name, atlantic, is, derived, from, the, mountain, range, which, stretches, around, 2, 500, km, 1, 600, mi, through, morocco, algeria, and, tunisia, the, range, s, highest, peak, is, toubkal, which, is, in, central, morocco, with, an, elevation, of, 4, 167, metres, 13, 671, ft, the, atlas, mountains, are, primarily, inhabited, by, berber, populations, the, terms, for, mountain, are, adrar, and, adras, in, some, berber, languages, and, these, terms, are, believed, to, be, cognates, of, the, toponym, atlas, the, mountains, are, home, to, a, number, of, animals, and, plants, which, are, mostly, found, within, africa, but, some, of, which, can, be, found, in, europe, many, of, these, species, are, endangered, and, a, few, are, already, extinct, the, weather, is, generally, cool, but, summers, are, sunny, and, the, average, temperature, there, is, 25, c, the, atlas, mountains, have, earned, a, reputation, as, a, trekkers, den, attracting, adventurers, year, round, the, basement, rock, of, most, of, africa, was, formed, during, the, precambrian, supereon, and, is, much, older, than, the, atlas, mountains, lying, on, the, continent, the, atlas, was, formed, during, three, subsequent, phases, of, earth, s, geology, the, first, tectonic, deformation, phase, involves, only, the, anti, atlas, which, was, formed, in, the, paleozoic, era, 300, million, years, ago, as, the, result, of, continental, collisions, north, america, europe, and, africa, were, connected, millions, of, years, ago, the, anti, atlas, mountains, are, believed, to, have, originally, been, formed, as, part, of, the, alleghenian, orogeny, these, mountains, were, formed, when, africa, and, america, collided, and, were, once, a, chain, rivaling, today, s, himalayas, today, the, remains, of, this, chain, can, be, seen, in, the, fall, line, region, in, the, eastern, united, states, some, remnants, can, also, be, found, in, the, later, formed, appalachians, in, north, america, a, second, phase, took, place, during, the, mesozoic, era, before, 66, my, it, consisted, of, a, widespread, extension, of, the, earth, s, crust, that, rifted, and, separated, the, continents, mentioned, above, this, extension, was, responsible, for, the, formation, of, many, thick, intracontinental, sedimentary, basins, including, the, present, atlas, most, of, the, rocks, forming, the, surface, of, the, present, high, atlas, were, deposited, under, the, ocean, at, that, time, in, the, paleogene, and, neogene, periods, 66, million, to, 1, 8, million, years, ago, the, mountain, chains, that, today, constitute, the, atlas, were, uplifted, as, the, land, masses, of, europe, and, africa, collided, at, the, southern, end, of, the, iberian, peninsula, such, convergent, tectonic, boundaries, occur, where, two, plates, slide, towards, each, other, forming, a, subduction, zone, if, one, plate, moves, underneath, the, other, and, or, a, continental, collision, when, the, two, plates, contain, continental, crust, in, the, case, of, the, africa, europe, collision, it, is, clear, that, tectonic, convergence, is, partially, responsible, for, the, formation, of, the, high, atlas, as, well, as, for, the, closure, of, the, strait, of, gibraltar, and, the, formation, of, the, alps, and, the, pyrenees, however, there, is, a, lack, of, evidence, for, the, nature, of, the, subduction, in, the, atlas, region, or, for, the, thickening, of, the, earth, s, crust, generally, associated, with, continental, collisions, one, of, the, most, striking, features, of, the, atlas, to, geologists, is, the, relative, small, amount, of, crustal, thickening, and, tectonic, shortening, despite, the, important, altitude, of, the, mountain, range, recent, studies, suggest, that, deep, processes, rooted, in, the, earth, s, mantle, may, have, contributed, to, the, uplift, of, the, high, and, middle, atlas, the, atlas, are, rich, in, natural, resources, there, are, deposits, of, iron, ore, lead, ore, copper, silver, mercury, rock, salt, phosphate, marble, anthracite, coal, and, natural, gas, among, other, resources, the, range, can, be, divided, into, four, general, regions, the, anti, atlas, extends, from, the, atlantic, ocean, in, the, southwest, of, morocco, toward, the, northeast, to, the, heights, of, ouarzazate, and, further, east, to, the, city, of, tafilalt, altogether, a, distance, of, approximately, 500, kilometres, or, 300, miles, in, the, south, it, borders, the, sahara, the, easternmost, point, of, the, anti, atlas, is, the, jbel, saghro, range, and, its, northern, boundary, is, flanked, by, sections, of, the, high, atlas, range, it, includes, the, djebel, siroua, a, massif, of, volcanic, origin, with, the, highest, summit, of, the, range, at, 3, 304, m, the, jebel, bani, is, a, much, lower, range, running, along, the, southern, side, of, the, anti, atlas, the, high, atlas, in, central, morocco, rises, in, the, west, at, the, atlantic, coast, and, stretches, in, an, eastern, direction, to, the, moroccan, algerian, border, it, has, several, peaks, over, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, including, the, highest, summit, in, north, africa, toubkal, 4, 167, m, or, 13, 671, ft, and, further, east, ighil, m, goun, 4, 071, m, or, 13, 356, ft, the, second, major, summit, of, the, range, at, the, atlantic, and, to, the, southwest, the, range, drops, abruptly, and, makes, a, transition, to, the, coast, and, the, anti, atlas, range, to, the, north, in, the, direction, of, marrakesh, the, range, descends, less, abruptly, on, the, heights, of, ouarzazate, the, massif, is, cut, through, by, the, draa, valley, which, opens, southward, it, is, mainly, inhabited, by, berber, people, who, live, in, small, villages, and, cultivate, the, high, plains, of, the, ourika, valley, near, barrage, cavagnac, there, is, a, hydroelectric, dam, that, has, created, the, artificial, lake, lalla, takerkoust, the, lake, serves, also, as, a, source, for, fish, for, the, local, fishermen, the, largest, villages, and, towns, of, the, area, are, ouarzazate, tahannaout, amizmiz, imlil, tin, mal, and, ijoukak, the, middle, atlas, is, completely, in, morocco, and, is, the, northernmost, of, its, three, main, atlas, ranges, the, range, lies, north, of, the, high, atlas, separated, by, the, moulouya, and, oum, er, rbia, rivers, and, south, of, the, rif, mountains, separated, by, the, sebou, river, to, the, west, are, the, main, coastal, plains, of, morocco, with, many, of, the, major, cities, and, to, the, east, the, high, barren, plateau, that, lies, between, the, saharan, and, tell, atlas, the, high, point, of, the, range, is, the, jbel, bou, naceur, 3340, m, the, middle, atlas, experiences, more, rain, than, the, ranges, to, the, south, making, it, an, important, water, catchment, for, the, coastal, plains, and, important, for, biodiversity, it, is, home, to, the, majority, of, the, world, s, population, of, barbary, macaque, the, saharan, atlas, of, algeria, runs, east, of, the, high, atlas, crossing, algeria, from, the, moroccan, border, and, into, tunisia, the, aures, mountains, are, often, presented, as, being, the, easternmost, part, of, the, saharan, atlas, though, not, as, high, as, the, high, atlas, they, reach, similar, altitudes, as, the, tell, atlas, range, that, runs, to, the, north, of, them, and, closer, to, the, coast, the, highest, peak, in, the, range, outside, of, the, aures, mountains, is, the, 2, 236, m, 7, 336, ft, high, djebel, aissa, they, mark, the, northern, edge, of, the, sahara, desert, the, mountains, see, some, rainfall, and, are, better, suited, to, agriculture, than, the, plateau, region, to, the, north, today, most, of, the, population, of, the, region, are, berbers, imazighen, the, tell, atlas, is, a, mountain, chain, over, 1, 500, kilometres, 900, mi, in, length, belonging, to, the, atlas, mountain, ranges, and, stretching, from, eastern, morocco, to, tunisia, and, through, algeria, it, parallels, the, mediterranean, coast, and, joins, with, the, saharan, atlas, in, eastern, algeria, and, tunisia, the, highest, summit, of, the, tell, atlas, is, the, 2, 308, m, 7, 572, ft, lalla, khadidja, in, the, djurdjura, range, of, kabylia, the, western, end, of, the, tell, atlas, merges, with, the, middle, atlas, range, in, morocco, the, area, immediately, to, the, south, of, the, tell, atlas, is, the, high, plateau, of, the, hautes, plaines, with, lakes, in, the, wet, season, and, salt, flats, in, the, dry, the, eastern, half, of, the, tell, atlas, has, the, most, humid, climate, of, north, africa, with, annual, precipitation, reaching, well, above, 1, 000, mm, 39, in, and, sometimes, over, 1, 500, mm, 59, in, like, in, the, collo, peninsula, or, near, ain, draham, an, important, amount, of, snow, falls, on, the, summits, in, winter, the, aur, s, mountains, are, the, easternmost, portion, of, the, atlas, mountain, range, it, covers, parts, of, algeria, and, tunisia, the, aur, s, natural, region, is, named, after, the, range, flora, in, the, mountains, include, the, atlas, cedar, evergreen, oak, and, many, semi, evergreen, oaks, such, as, the, algerian, oak, animals, that, live, in, the, area, include, the, barbary, macaque, misnamed, as, the, barbary, ape, barbary, leopard, barbary, stag, barbary, sheep, atlas, mountain, badger, cuvier, s, gazelle, north, african, boar, striped, hyena, red, fox, northern, bald, ibis, algerian, nuthatch, dipper, and, atlas, mountain, viper, many, animals, used, to, inhabit, the, atlas, mountains, such, as, the, atlas, bear, north, african, elephant, north, african, aurochs, bubal, hartebeest, and, atlas, wild, ass, but, these, subspecies, are, all, extinct, barbary, lions, are, currently, extinct, in, the, wild, but, descendants, exist, in, captivity
