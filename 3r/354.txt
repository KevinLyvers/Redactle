expected, to, be, highly, affected, as, the, region, s, extensive, irrigation, networks, result, in, unusually, moist, air, in, scenarios, without, aggressive, action, to, stop, climate, change, the, worst, heatwaves, are, projected, to, become, severe, enough, to, cause, mass, mortality, in, agricultural, labourers, working, outdoors, under, the, most, extreme, climate, change, scenario, the,
