the, capital, of, undivided, assam, until, the, formation, of, the, state, of, meghalaya, in, 1972, the, capital, of, assam, was, shifted, to, dispur, a, part, of, guwahati, and, shillong, was, designated, as, the, capital, of, meghalaya, initially, the, japanese, had, invaded, british, territories, in, southeast, asia, including, burma, now, myanmar, with, the, intention, of, creating, a,

india, the, sobriquet, land, of, the, seven, sisters, was, coined, to, coincide, with, the, inauguration, of, the, new, states, in, january, 1972, by, jyoti, prasad, saikia, a, journalist, in,
