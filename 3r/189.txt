the, most, populated, basin, in, the, iberian, peninsula, with, more, than, ten, million, inhabitants, it, includes, the, madrid, metropolitan, area, and, the, lisbon, region, the, tagus, basin, has, a, total, reservoir, capacity, of, around, 14, 500, hm, 3, 510, billion, cu, ft, the, lower, tagus, region, in, portugal, is, a, seismically, active, area, major, earthquakes, in, the, lower, tagus, include, those, of, 1309, 1531, 1755, and, 1909, the, tagus, river, is, one, of, the, few, rivers, in, the, world, to, have, an, inverted, delta, its, delta, is, wider, at, the, beginning, and, narrows, down, as, it, approaches, the, sea, contrary, to, a, typical, delta, this, is, because, it, flows, into, the, sea, through, a, small, opening, in, a, valley, although, due, to, sedimentation, this, delta, is, now, only, very, partially, inverted, with, the, valley, now, mostly, filled, with, sediment, the, delta, is, about, 15, km, 9, mi, wide, and, 25, km, 16, mi, long, but, its, exit, into, the, sea, is, only, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, wide, it, thus, forms, a, large, lagoon, with, large, and, very, shallow, sand, banks, which, go, uncovered, during, low, tides, the, delta, used, to, be, even, bigger, thousands, of, years, ago, the, hydrological, regime, of, the, tagus, is, determined, by, the, rain, and, snow, variations, typical, of, the, central, region, of, the, iberian, peninsula, especially, in, reference, to, the, mountain, formations, integrated, here, the, river, s, major, floods, usually, occur, from, january, to, april, with, an, absolute, maximum, in, march, when, thawing, occurs, while, the, lowest, flows, occur, between, july, and, october, with, a, minimum, in, september, this, results, in, a, very, irregular, course, with, strong, flow, oscillations, as, it, passes, through, alc, ntara, c, ceres, these, range, from, 350, m, 3, s, 12, 000, cu, ft, s, in, february, and, march, to, 11, m, 3, s, 390, cu, ft, s, in, august, and, september, this, regime, has, been, altered, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, as, a, result, of, the, construction, of, different, engineering, works, aimed, at, regulating, its, basin, for, five, main, uses, drinking, water, supply, irrigation, water, diversion, to, an, external, basin, that, of, the, segura, river, electricity, production, and, cooling, of, nuclear, power, plants, the, banks, and, areas, of, influence, of, the, tagus, are, home, to, relevant, flora, and, fauna, representative, of, the, central, region, of, the, iberian, peninsula, the, high, degree, of, depopulation, in, some, areas, integrated, into, its, basin, such, as, its, upper, and, middle, lower, course, has, allowed, the, preservation, of, places, of, great, ecological, interest, some, of, them, have, been, legally, protected, such, as, the, alto, tajo, natural, park, guadalajara, and, cuenca, the, monfrag, e, national, park, c, ceres, and, the, tagus, estuary, natural, reserve, near, lisbon, around, the, course, of, the, river, four, endangered, animal, species, live, the, iberian, lynx, the, spanish, imperial, eagle, the, black, stork, and, the, black, vulture, in, addition, to, its, geographical, relevance, the, tagus, has, great, historical, importance, resulting, from, its, connection, with, toledo, and, lisbon, two, of, the, cities, with, the, greatest, weight, and, historical, journey, in, the, iberian, peninsula, the, first, was, built, on, a, hill, about, 100, m, high, around, the, meander, known, as, torno, del, tajo, which, preserved, it, from, possible, attacks, and, incursions, from, the, late, middle, ages, the, mouth, of, the, tagus, articulated, an, intense, commercial, activity, between, northern, europe, and, the, mediterranean, from, the, renaissance, it, was, the, main, communications, hub, of, the, portuguese, empire, which, extended, through, america, africa, and, asia, the, nearly, 100, km, 60, mi, of, the, alto, tajo, canyon, as, it, passes, through, the, natural, park, of, the, same, name, offer, one, of, the, best, options, for, practicing, whitewater, canoeing, in, the, central, peninsula, several, adventure, companies, offer, this, activity, in, the, vicinity, of, poveda, de, la, sierra, and, ocentejo, in, the, flat, water, modality, canoeing, can, be, practiced, in, the, entrepe, as, and, bolarque, reservoirs, there, are, also, important, flat, water, canoeing, clubs, in, aranjuez, and, talavera, de, la, reina
