to, the, ancient, greeks, as, the, istros, from, a, root, possibly, also, encountered, in, the, ancient, name, of, the, dniester, danaster, in, latin, tiras, in, greek, and, akin, to, iranic, turos, swift, and, sanskrit, i, iras, swift, from, the, pie, isro, sreu, to, flow, in, the, middle, ages, the, greek, tiras, was, borrowed, into, italian, as, tyrlo, and, into, turkic, languages, as, tyrla,

although, romanian, is, a, romance, language, to, explain, the, loss, of, the, latin, name, scholars, who, suppose, that, romanian, developed, near, the, large, river, propose, that, the, romanian, name, descends, from, a, hypothetical, thracian, donaris, the, proto, indo, european, root, of, this, presumed, name, is, related, to, the, iranic, word, don, dan, while, the, supposed, suffix, aris, is, encountered, in, the, ancient, name, of, the, ialomi, a, river, naparis, and, in, the, unidentified, miliare, river, mentioned, by, jordanes, in, his, getica, g, bor, v, kony, says, that, this, hypothesis, is, not, plausible, because, the, greeks, borrowed, the, istros, form, from, the, native, thracians, he, proposes, that, the, romanian, name, is, a, loanword, from, a, turkic, language,

interesting, geological, complications, since, the, rhine, is, the, only, river, rising, in, the, alps, mountains, which, flows, north, towards, the, north, sea, an, invisible, line, beginning, at, piz, lunghin, divides, large, parts, of, southern, germany, which, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, european, watershed, before, the, last, ice, age, in, the, pleistocene, the, rhine, started, at, the, southwestern, tip, of, the, black, forest, while, the, waters, from, the, alps, that, today, feed, the, rhine, were, carried, east, by, the, so, called, urdonau, original, danube, parts, of,

the, rhine, on, many, days, in, the, summer, when, the, danube, carries, little, water, it, completely, oozes, away, noisily, into, these, underground, channels, at, two, locations, in, the, swabian, alb, which, are, referred, to, as, the, donauversickerung, danube, sink, most, of, this, water, resurfaces, only, 12, km, 7, 5, mi, south, at, the, aachtopf, germany, s, wellspring, with, the,

beyond, this, point, and, only, during, the, days, of, the, year, when, the, danube, carries, enough, water, to, survive, the, sinkholes, in, the, donauversickerung, since, such, large, volumes, of, underground, water, erode, much, of, the, surrounding, limestone, it, is, estimated, that, the, danube, upper, course, will, one, day, disappear, entirely, in, favor, of, the, rhine, an, event,

the, danube, was, an, important, waterway, but, was, as, the, times, of, london, put, it, annually, swept, by, ice, that, will, lift, a, large, ship, out, of, the, water, or, cut, her, in, two, as, if, she, were, a, carrot, today, as, corridor, vii, of, the, european, union, the, danube, is, an, important, transport, route, since, the, opening, of, the, rhine, main, danube, canal, the, river, connects, the, port, of, rotterdam, and, the, industrial, centers, of, western, europe, with, the, black, sea, and, also, through, the, danube, black, sea, canal, with, the, port, of, constan, a, the, waterway, is, designed, for, large, scale, inland, vessels, 110, 11, 45, m, but, it, can, carry, much, larger, vessels, on, most, of, its, course, the, danube, has, been, partly, canalized, in, germany, 5, locks, and, austria, 10, locks, proposals, to, build, a, number, of, new, locks, to, improve, navigation, have, not, progressed, due, in, part, to, environmental, concerns, downstream, from, the, freudenau, locks, in, vienna, canalization, of, the, danube, was, limited, to, the, gab, kovo, dam, and, locks, near, bratislava, and, the, two, double, iron, gate, locks, in, the, border, stretch, of, the, danube, between, serbia, and, romania, these, locks, have, larger, dimensions, downstream, of, the, iron, gate, the, river, is, free, flowing, all, the, way, to, the, black, sea, a, distance, of, more, than, 860, kilometres, 530, mi, the, danube, connects, with, the, rhine, main, danube, canal, at, kelheim, with, the, donaukanal, in, vienna, and, with, the, danube, black, sea,

of, flat, bottomed, boat, called, a, zille, was, developed, for, use, along, the, river, zillen, are, still, used, today, for, fishing, ferrying, and, other, transport, of, goods, and, people, in, this, area, the, importance, of, fishing, on, the, danube, which, was, critical, in, the, middle, ages, has, declined, dramatically, some, fishermen, are, still, active, at, certain, points, on, the, river, and, the, danube, delta, still, has, an, important, industry, however, some, of, the, river, s, resources, have, been, managed, in, an, environmentally, unsustainable, manner, in, the, past, leading, to, damage, by, pollution, alterations, to, the, channel, and, major, infrastructure, development, including, large, hydropower, dams, the, sturgeon, stocks, associated, with, the, danube, river, basin, have, over, the, centuries, formed, the, basis, of, a, large, and, significant, commercial, fishery, renowned, throughout, the, world, the, construction, of, the, dams, besides, overfishing, and, river, pollution, has, a, significant, role, in, sturgeon, population, decline, because, it, creates, a, barrier, for, fish, migratory, species, that, usually, spawn, in, the, upper, parts, of, the, river, the, spawning, areas, of, migratory, fishes, species, has, been, dramatically, reduced, by, the, construction, of, hydropower, and, navigation, systems, at, iron, gates, i, 1974, and, iron, gates, ii, 1984, the, initial, design, of, these, dams, has, not, included, any, fish, passage, facility, the, possibility, of, building, a, human, made, fish, pass, enabling, migration, for, fish, species, including, the, sturgeon, is, currently, under, review, by, projects, such, as, we, pass, the, upper, danube, ecoregion, alone, has, about, 60, fish, species, and, the, lower, danube, dniester, ecoregion, has, about, twice, as, many, among, these, are, an, exceptionally, high, diversity, of, sturgeon, a, total, of, six, species, beluga, russian, sturgeon, bastard, sturgeon, sterlet, starry, sturgeon, and, european, sea, sturgeon, but, these, are, all, threatened, and, have, largely, or, entirely, in, the, case, of, the, european, sea, sturgeon, disappeared, from, the, river, the, huchen, one, of, the, largest, species, of, salmon, is, endemic, to, the, danube, basin, but, has, been, introduced, elsewhere, by, humans, important, tourist, and, natural,
