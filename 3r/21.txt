the, elevation, of, a, geographic, location, is, its, height, above, or, below, a, fixed, reference, point, most, commonly, a, reference, geoid, a, mathematical, model, of, the, earth, s, sea, level, as, an, equipotential, gravitational, surface, see, geodetic, datum, vertical, datum, the, term, elevation, is, mainly, used, when, referring, to, points, on, the, earth, s, surface, while, altitude, or, geopotential, height, is, used, for, points, above, the, surface, such, as, an, aircraft, in, flight, or, a, spacecraft, in, orbit, and, depth, is, used, for, points, below, the, surface, elevation, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, distance, from, the, center, of, the, earth, due, to, the, equatorial, bulge, the, summits, of, mount, everest, and, chimborazo, have, respectively, the, largest, elevation, and, the, largest, geocentric, distance, in, aviation, the, term, elevation, or, aerodrome, elevation, is, defined, by, the, icao, as, the, highest, point, of, the, landing, area, it, is, often, measured, in, feet, and, can, be, found, in, approach, charts, of, the, aerodrome, it, is, not, to, be, confused, with, terms, such, as, the, altitude, or, height, gis, or, geographic, information, system, is, a, computer, system, that, allows, for, visualizing, manipulating, capturing, and, storage, of, data, with, associated, attributes, gis, offers, better, understanding, of, patterns, and, relationships, of, the, landscape, at, different, scales, tools, inside, the, gis, allow, for, manipulation, of, data, for, spatial, analysis, or, cartography, a, topographical, map, is, the, main, type, of, map, used, to, depict, elevation, often, through, contour, lines, in, a, geographic, information, system, gis, digital, elevation, models, dem, are, commonly, used, to, represent, the, surface, topography, of, a, place, through, a, raster, grid, dataset, of, elevations, digital, terrain, models, are, another, way, to, represent, terrain, in, gis, usgs, united, states, geologic, survey, is, developing, a, 3d, elevation, program, 3dep, to, keep, up, with, growing, needs, for, high, quality, topographic, data, 3dep, is, a, collection, of, enhanced, elevation, data, in, the, form, of, high, quality, lidar, data, over, the, conterminous, united, states, hawaii, and, the, u, s, territories, there, are, three, bare, earth, dem, layers, in, 3dep, which, are, nationally, seamless, at, the, resolution, of, 1, 3, 1, and, 2, arcseconds
