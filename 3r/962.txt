pardo, mabolo, talamban, and, banilad, in, the, commonwealth, period, the, city, has, experienced, rapid, economic, growth, since, the, 1990s, a, phenomenon, also, known, as, ceboom, owing, to, its, economic, importance, and, influence, in, modern, times, cebu, city, is, also, popularly, referred, to, as, the, queen, city, of, the, south, a, sobriquet, adopted, from, iloilo, city, after, its, economic, decline, in, the, mid, 1900s, the, word, sugb, in, cebuano, visayan, means, to, dive, into, water, and, also, in, tagalog, hiligaynon, aklanon, and, mansaka, languages, with, more, or, less, the, same, meaning, the, name, is, probably, derived, from, the, proto, philippine, word, sug, e, bu, meaning, to, wade, into, water, as, with, most, settlements, in, the, philippines, whose, common, origin, is, either, derived, from, an, abundance, of, plants, for, example, manila, and, one, of, the, most, common, names, of, cities, in, the, philippines, talisay, and, settlements, near, a, body, of, water, for, example, iloilo, and, the, island, of, mindanao, early, iterations, of, the, name, include, ubu, and, zubu, and, then, eventually, cebu, thus, the, modern, name, is, either, probably, a, 16th, 17th, century, spanish, pronunciation, of, the, native, name, or, as, how, it, was, heard, by, early, chroniclers, in, that, time, period, the, selden, map, records, the, island, known, to, the, ming, dynasty, as, sokbu, a, hokkien, pronunciation, of, the, name, in, mandarin, chinese, suwu, in, the, early, 17th, century, very, little, is, known, about, when, the, site, was, first, settled, prior, to, colonization, but, artifacts, have, been, discovered, near, the, city, if, not, exactly, at, the, site, in, what, is, now, cebu, city, dating, back, to, at, least, the, 14th, to, 15th, centuries, ce, the, city, s, only, reliable, historical, record, started, with, portuguese, explorer, ferdinand, magellan, s, landing, in, the, island, in, 1521, ce, and, then, after, the, battle, of, mactan, it, is, then, followed, by, a, brief, period, of, silence, and, almost, nihility, and, back, again, in, 1565, ce, when, miguel, l, pez, de, legazpi, led, an, expedition, back, to, the, island, though, there, are, artifacts, detailing, the, settlement, of, the, island, as, early, as, 2000, bce, the, exact, date, of, when, the, village, was, settled, and, named, sugbu, is, unknown, since, prior, to, colonization, most, visayans, were, illiterate, up, until, the, later, half, of, the, 16th, century, when, magellan, and, crew, arrived, in, 1521, ce, the, europeans, did, not, mention, or, state, a, thriving, city, in, a, european, or, chinese, sense, and, nor, it, was, ever, been, described, as, a, kingdom, as, there, were, no, kingdoms, in, pre, colonial, philippines, other, than, it, was, merely, a, simple, fishing, and, trading, village, there, is, a, popular, myth, that, the, city, was, supposedly, founded, by, sri, lumay, and, that, the, place, was, once, kang, sri, lumayng, sugbo, however, the, authenticity, of, this, source, is, highly, debatable, and, should, not, be, taken, seriously, there, are, no, existing, documents, predating, spanish, chroniclers, that, made, a, reference, to, the, island, and, there, was, no, mention, of, the, so, called, sri, lumay, fr, francisco, ignacio, alcina, s, history, of, the, bisayan, islands, does, not, even, mention, the, epic, or, any, reference, to, that, person, also, in, the, compilation, of, spanish, accounts, by, esteemed, american, historian, specializing, in, philippine, history, william, henry, scott, there, is, no, mention, of, any, scorched, earth, tactics, in, visayan, warfare, it, is, likely, then, that, the, legend, is, an, invention, by, jovito, abellana, the, supposed, capital, city, singhapala, was, also, not, mentioned, as, a, capital, city, instead, antonio, pigafetta, a, chronicler, in, magellan, s, crew, records, cingapola, as, a, town, whose, chiefs, are, cilaton, ciguibucan, cimaninga, cimaticat, and, cicanbul, if, it, were, a, rich, city, it, would, be, very, unlikely, to, be, ignored, by, the, chronicler, despite, the, smallness, of, the, polity, of, cebu, it, had, the, same, indianized, malay, culture, as, its, more, well, developed, advanced, neighbors, like, the, rajahnate, of, butuan, in, southeast, asia, which, it, had, dynastic, links, to, as, rajah, siagu, of, butuan, was, the, cousin, of, rajah, humabon, and, also, proven, by, the, titles, of, native, cebuano, nobility, wherein, king, humabon, was, adressed, in, the, sanskrit,
