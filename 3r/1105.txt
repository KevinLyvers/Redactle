contentious, and, not, straightforward, with, the, parliament, of, the, united, province, of, canada, holding, more, than, 200, votes, over, several, decades, to, attempt, to, settle, on, a, legislative, solution, to, the, location, of, the, capital, the, governor, general, of, the, province, had, designated, kingston, as, the, capital, in, 1841, however, the, major, population, centres, of, toronto, and, montreal, as, well, as, the, former, capital, of, lower, canada, quebec, city, all, had, legislators, dissatisfied, with, kingston, anglophone, merchants, in, quebec, were, the, leading, group, supportive, of, the, kingston, arrangement, in, 1842, a, vote, rejected, kingston, as, the, capital, and, study, of, potential, candidates, included, the, then, named, bytown, but, that, option, proved, less, popular, than, toronto, or, montreal, in, 1843, a, report, of, the, executive, council, recommended, montreal, as, the, capital, as, a, more, fortifiable, location, and, commercial, centre, however, the, governor, general, refused, to, execute, a, move, without, a, parliamentary, vote, in, 1844, the, queen, s, acceptance, of, a, parliamentary, vote, moved, the, capital, to, montreal, in, 1849, after, violence, in, montreal, a, series, of, votes, was, held, with, kingston, and, bytown, again, considered, potential, capitals, however, the, successful, proposal, was, for, two, cities, to, share, capital, status, and, the, legislature, to, alternate, sitting, in, each, quebec, city, and, toronto, in, a, policy, known, as, perambulation, logistical, difficulties, made, this, an, unpopular, arrangement, and, although, an, 1856, vote, passed, for, the, lower, house, of, parliament, to, relocate, permanently, to, quebec, city, the, upper, house, refused, to, approve, funding, the, funding, impasse, led, to, the, ending, of, the, legislature, s, role, in, determining, the, seat, of, government, the, legislature, requested, the, queen, determine, the, seat, of, government, the, queen, then, acted, on, the, advice, of, her, governor, general, edmund, head, who, after, reviewing, proposals, from, various, cities, selected, the, recently, renamed, ottawa, the, queen, sent, a, letter, to, colonial, authorities, selecting, ottawa, as, the, capital, effective, 31, december, 1857, george, brown, briefly, a, co, premier, of, the, province, of, canada, attempted, to, reverse, this, decision, but, was, unsuccessful, the, parliament, ratified, the, queen, s, choice, in, 1859, with, quebec, serving, as, interim, capital, from, 1859, to, 1865, the, relocation, process, began, in, 1865, with, the, first, session, of, parliament, held, in, the, new, buildings, in, 1866, the, buildings, were, generally, well, received, by, legislators, ottawa, was, chosen, as, the, capital, for, two, primary, reasons, first, ottawa, s, isolated, location, surrounded, by, dense, forest, far, from, the, canada, us, border, and, situated, on, a, cliff, face, would, make, it, more, defensible, from, attack, second, ottawa, was, approximately, midway, between, toronto, and, kingston, in, canada, west, and, montreal, and, quebec, city, in, canada, east, making, the, selection, an, important, political, compromise, other, minor, considerations, included, that, despite, ottawa, s, regional, isolation, there, was, water, transportation, access, from, spring, to, fall, both, to, montreal, via, the, ottawa, river, and, to, kingston, via, the, rideau, waterway, additionally, by, 1854, it, also, had, a, modern, all,

ottawa, s, small, size, was, also, thought, to, be, less, prone, to, politically, motivated, mob, violence, as, had, happened, in, the, previous, canadian, capitals, finally, the, government, already, owned, the, land, that, eventually, became, parliament, hill, which, it, thought, would, be, an, ideal, location, for, the, parliament, buildings, the, original, parliament, buildings, which,
