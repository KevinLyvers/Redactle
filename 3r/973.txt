of, bahram, chobin, who, resisted, the, seventh, century, muslim, invasion, of, iran, because, of, this, resistance, when, the, arabs, captured, rhages, they, ordered, the, town, destroyed, and, rebuilt, anew, by, traitor, aristocrat, farrukhzad, in, the, ninth, century, tehran, was, a, well, known, village, but, less, so, than, the, city, of, rhages, flourishing, nearby, rhages, was, described, in, detail, by, tenth, century, muslim, geographers, despite, the, interest, that, arabian, baghdad, displayed, in, rhages, the, number, of, arabs, in, the, city, remained, insignificant, and, the, population, mainly, consisted, of, iranians, of, all, classes, the, oghuz, turks, invaded, rhages, in, 1035, and, again, in, 1042, but, the, city, was, recovered, under, the, seljuks, and, the, khwarezmians, medieval, writer, najm, od, din, razi, declared, the, population, of, rhages, about, 500, 000, before, the, mongol, invasion, in, the, 13th, century, the, mongols, invaded, rhages, laid, the, city, to, ruins, and, massacred, many, of, its, inhabitants, others, escaped, to, tehran, in, july, 1404, castilian, ambassador, ruy, gonz, lez, de, clavijo, visited, tehran, on, a, journey, to, samarkand, the, capital, of, turco, mongol, conqueror, timur, the, ruler, of, iran, at, the, time, he, described, it, in, his, diary, as, an, unwalled, region, italian, traveler, pietro, della, valle, passed, through, tehran, overnight, in, 1618, and, in, his, memoirs, called, the, city, taheran, english, traveler, thomas, herbert, entered, tehran, in, 1627, and, mentioned, it, as, tyroan, herbert, stated, that, the, city, had, about, 3, 000, houses, in, the, early, 18th, century, karim, khan, of, the, zand, dynasty, ordered, a, palace, and, a, government, office, built, in, tehran, possibly, to, declare, the, city, his, capital, but, he, later, moved, his, government, to, shiraz, eventually, qajar, king, agha, mohammad, khan, chose, tehran, as, the, capital, of, iran, in, 1786, agha, mohammad, khan, s, choice, of, his, capital, was, based, on, a, similar, concern, for, the, control, of, both, northern, and, southern, iran, he, was, aware, of, the, loyalties, of, the, inhabitants, of, former, capitals, isfahan, and, shiraz, to, the, safavid, and, zand, dynasties, respectively, and, was, wary, of, the, power, of, the, local, notables, in, these, cities, thus, he, probably, viewed, tehran, s, lack, of, a, substantial, urban, structure, as, a, blessing, because, it, minimized, the, chances, of, resistance, to, his, rule, by, the, notables, and, by, the, general, public, moreover, he, had, to, remain, within, close, reach, of, azerbaijan, and, iran, s, integral, northern, and, southern, caucasian, territories, at, that, time, not, yet, irrevocably, lost, per, the, treaties, of, golestan, and, turkmenchay, to, the, neighboring, russian, empire, which, would, follow, in, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, after, 50, years, of, qajar, rule, the,

19, 79, square, kilometers, and, had, expanded, more, than, fourfold, growing, awareness, of, civil, rights, resulted, in, the, constitutional, revolution, and, the, first, constitution, of, iran, in,

avenues, and, the, traditional, texture, of, the, city, was, replaced, with, intersecting, cruciform, streets, that, created, large, roundabouts, in, major, public, spaces, such, as, the, bazaar, as,
