development, producing, a, series, of, innovations, that, laid, many, of, the, foundations, of, modern, industrial, society, by, 1791, it, was, being, hailed, as, the, first, manufacturing, town, in, the, world, birmingham, s, distinctive, economic, profile, with, thousands, of, small, workshops, practising, a, wide, variety, of, specialised, and, highly, skilled, trades, encouraged, exceptional, levels, of, creativity, and, innovation, this, provided, an, economic, base, for, prosperity, that, was, to, last, into, the, final, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, the, watt, steam, engine, was, invented, in, birmingham, the, resulting, high, level, of, social, mobility, also, fostered, a, culture, of, political, radicalism, which, under, leaders, from, thomas, attwood, to, joseph, chamberlain, was, to, give, it, a, political, influence, unparalleled, in, britain, outside, london, and, a, pivotal, role, in, the, development, of, british, democracy, from, the, summer, of, 1940, to, the, spring, of, 1943, birmingham, was, bombed, heavily, by, the, german, luftwaffe, in, what, is, known, as, the, birmingham, blitz, the, damage, done, to, the, city, s, infrastructure, in,

birmingham, was, the, host, city, for, the, 2022, commonwealth, games, in, 2021, birmingham, was, the, third, most, visited, city, in, the, uk, by, people, from, foreign, nations, the, name, birmingham, comes, from, the, old, english, beormingah, m, meaning, the, home, or, settlement, of, the, beormingas, a, tribe, or, clan, whose, name, means, beorma, s, people, and, which, may, have, formed, an, early, unit, of, anglo, saxon, administration, beorma, after, whom, the, tribe, was, named, could, have, been, its, leader, at, the, time, of, the, anglo, saxon, settlement, a, shared, ancestor, or, a, mythical, tribal, figurehead, place, names, ending, in, ingah, m, are, characteristic, of, primary, settlements, established, during, the, early, phases, of, anglo, saxon, colonisation, of, an, area, suggesting, that, birmingham, was, probably, in, existence, by, the, early, 7th, century, at, the, latest, surrounding, settlements, with, names, ending, in, t, n, farm, l, ah, woodland, clearing, wor, enclosure, and, field, open, ground, are, likely, to, be, secondary, settlements, created, by, the, later, expansion, of, the, anglo, saxon, population, in, some, cases, possibly, on, earlier, british, sites, there, is, evidence, of, early, human, activity, in, the, birmingham, area, dating, back, to, around, 8000, bc, with, stone, age, artefacts, suggesting, seasonal, settlements, overnight, hunting, parties, and, woodland, activities, such, as, tree, felling, the, many, burnt, mounds, that, can, still, be, seen, around, the, city, indicate, that, modern, humans, first, intensively, settled, and, cultivated, the, area, during, the, bronze, age, when, a, substantial, but, short, lived, influx, of, population, occurred, between, 1700, bc, and, 1000, bc, possibly, caused, by, conflict, or, immigration, in, the, surrounding, area, during, the, 1st, century, roman, conquest, of, britain, the, forested, country, of, the, birmingham, plateau, formed, a, barrier, to, the, advancing, roman, legions, who, built, the, large, metchley, fort, in, the, area, of, modern, day, edgbaston, in, ad, 48, and, made, it, the, focus, of, a, network, of, roman, roads, birmingham, was, then, later, established, by, the, beormingas, around, the, 6th, or, 7th, century, as, a, small, settlement, in, the, then, heavily, forested, arden, region, in, mercia, the, development, of, birmingham, into, a, significant, urban, and, commercial, centre, began, in, 1166, when, the, lord, of, the, manor, peter, de, bermingham, obtained, a, charter, to, hold, a, market, at, his, castle, and, followed, this, with, the, creation, of, a, planned, market, town, and, seigneurial, borough, within, his, demesne, or, manorial, estate, around, the, site, that, became, the, bull, ring, this, established, birmingham, as, the, primary, commercial, centre, for, the, birmingham, plateau, at, a, time, when, the, area, s, economy, was, expanding, rapidly, with, population, growth, nationally, leading, to, the, clearance, cultivation, and, settlement, of, previously, marginal, land, within, a, century, of, the, charter, birmingham, had, grown, into, a, prosperous, urban, centre, of, merchants, and, craftsmen, by, 1327, it, was, the, third, largest, town, in, warwickshire, a, position, it, would, retain, for, the, next, 200, years, the, principal, governing, institutions, of, medieval, birmingham, including, the, guild, of, the, holy, cross, and, the, lordship, of, the, de, birmingham, family, collapsed, between, 1536, and, 1547, leaving, the, town, with, an, unusually, high, degree, of, social, and, economic, freedom, and, initiating, a, period, of, transition, and, growth, by, 1700, birmingham, s, population, had, increased, fifteen, fold, and, the, town, was, the, fifth, largest, in, england, and, wales, the, importance, of, the, manufacture, of, iron, goods, to, birmingham, s, economy, was, recognised, as, early, as, 1538, and, grew, rapidly, as, the, century, progressed, equally, significant, was, the, town, s, emerging, role, as, a, centre, for, the, iron, merchants, who, organised, finance, supplied, raw, materials, and, traded, and, marketed, the, industry, s, products, by, the, 1600s, birmingham, formed, the, commercial, hub, of, a, network, of, forges, and, furnaces, stretching, from, south, wales, to, cheshire, and, its, merchants, were, selling, finished, manufactured, goods, as, far, afield, as, the, west, indies, these, trading, links, gave, birmingham, s, metalworkers, access, to, much, wider, markets, allowing, them, to, diversify, away, from, lower, skilled, trades, producing, basic, goods, for, local, sale, towards, a, broader, range, of, specialist, higher, skilled, and, more, lucrative, activities, by, the, time, of, the, english, civil, war, birmingham, s, booming, economy, its, expanding, population, and, its, resulting, high, levels, of, social, mobility, and, cultural, pluralism, had, seen, it, develop, new, social, structures, very, different, from, those, of, more, established, areas, relationships, were, built, around, pragmatic, commercial, linkages, rather, than, the, rigid, paternalism, and, deference, of, feudal, society, and, loyalties, to, the, traditional, hierarchies, of, the, established, church, and, aristocracy, were, weak, the, town, s, reputation, for, political, radicalism, and, its, strongly, parliamentarian, sympathies, saw, it, attacked, by, royalist, forces, in, the, battle, of, birmingham, in, 1643, and, it, developed, into, a, centre, of, puritanism, in, the, 1630s, and, as, a, haven, for, nonconformists, from, the, 1660s, the, 18th, century, saw, this, tradition, of, free, thinking, and, collaboration, blossom, into, the, cultural, phenomenon, now, known, as, the, midlands, enlightenment, the, town, developed, into, a, notable, centre, of, literary, musical, artistic, and, theatrical, activity, and, its, leading, citizens, particularly, the, members, of, the, lunar, society, of, birmingham, became, influential, participants, in, the, circulation, of, philosophical, and, scientific, ideas, among, europe, s, intellectual, elite, the, close, relationship, between, enlightenment, birmingham, s, leading, thinkers, and, its, major, manufacturers, in, men, like, matthew, boulton, and, james, keir, they, were, often, in, fact, the, same, people, made, it, particularly, important, for, the, exchange, of, knowledge, between, pure, science, and, the, practical, world, of, manufacturing, and, technology, this, created, a, chain, reaction, of, innovation, forming, a, pivotal, link, between, the, earlier, scientific, revolution, and, the, industrial, revolution, that, would, follow, birmingham, s, explosive, industrial, expansion, started, earlier, than, that, of, the, textile, manufacturing, towns, of, the, north, of, england, and, was, driven, by, different, factors, instead, of, the, economies, of, scale, of, a, low, paid, unskilled, workforce, producing, a, single, bulk, commodity, such, as, cotton, or, wool, in, large, mechanised, units, of, production, birmingham, s, industrial, development, was, built, on, the, adaptability, and, creativity, of, a, highly, paid, workforce, with, a, strong, division, of, labour, practising, a, broad, variety, of, skilled, specialist, trades, and, producing, a, constantly, diversifying, range, of, products, in, a, highly, entrepreneurial, economy, of, small, often, self, owned, workshops, this, led, to, exceptional, levels, of, inventiveness, between, 1760, and, 1850, the, core, years, of, the, industrial, revolution, birmingham, residents, registered, over, three, times, as, many, patents, as, those, of, any, other, british, town, or, city, the, demand, for, capital, to, feed, rapid, economic, expansion, also, saw, birmingham, grow, into, a, major, financial, centre, with, extensive, international, connections, lloyds, bank, was, founded, in, the, town, in, 1765, and, ketley, s, building, society, the, world, s, first, building, society, in, 1775, by, 1800, the, west, midlands, had, more, banking, offices, per, head, than, any, other, region, in, britain, including, london, innovation, in, 18th, century, birmingham, often, took, the, form, of, incremental, series, of, small, scale, improvements, to, existing, products, or, processes, but, also, included, major, developments, that, lay, at, the, heart, of, the, emergence, of, industrial, society, in, 1709, the, birmingham, trained, abraham, darby, i, moved, to, coalbrookdale, in, shropshire, and, built, the, first, blast, furnace, to, successfully, smelt, iron, ore, with, coke, transforming, the, quality, volume, and, scale, on, which, it, was, possible, to, produce, cast, iron, in, 1732, lewis, paul, and, john, wyatt, invented, roller, spinning, the, one, novel, idea, of, the, first, importance, in, the, development, of, the, mechanised, cotton, industry, in, 1741, they, opened, the, world, s, first, cotton, mill, in, birmingham, s, upper, priory, in, 1746, john, roebuck, invented, the, lead, chamber, process, enabling, the, large, scale, manufacture, of, sulphuric, acid, and, in, 1780, james, keir, developed, a, process, for, the, bulk, manufacture, of, alkali, together, marking, the, birth, of, the, modern, chemical, industry, in, 1765, matthew, boulton, opened, the, soho, manufactory, pioneering, the, combination, and, mechanisation, under, one, roof, of, previously, separate, manufacturing, activities, through, a, system, known, as, rational, manufacture, as, the, largest, manufacturing, unit, in, europe, this, came, to, symbolise, the, emergence, of, the, factory, system, most, significant, however, was, the, development, in, 1776, of, the, industrial, steam, engine, by, james, watt, and, matthew, boulton, freeing, for, the, first, time, the, manufacturing, capacity, of, human, society, from, the, limited, availability, of, hand, water, and, animal, power, this, was, arguably, the, pivotal, moment, of, the, entire, industrial, revolution, and, a, key, factor, in, the, worldwide, increases, in, productivity, over, the, following, century, birmingham, rose, to, national, political, prominence, in, the, campaign, for, political, reform, in, the, early, 19th, century, with, thomas, attwood, and, the, birmingham, political, union, bringing, the, country, to, the, brink, of, civil, war, during, the, days, of, may, that, preceded, the, passing, of, the, great, reform, act, in, 1832, the, union, s, meetings, on, newhall, hill, in, 1831, and, 1832, were, the, largest, political, assemblies, britain, had, ever, seen, lord, durham, who, drafted, the, act, wrote, that, the, country, owed, reform, to, birmingham, and, its, salvation, from, revolution, this, reputation, for, having, shaken, the, fabric, of, privilege, to, its, base, in, 1832, led, john, bright, to, make, birmingham, the, platform, for, his, successful, campaign, for, the, second, reform, act, of, 1867, which, extended, voting, rights, to, the, urban, working, class, the, original, charter, of, incorporation, dated, 31, october, 1838,

but, its, economic, diversity, and, capacity, for, regeneration, declined, in, the, decades, that, followed, world, war, ii, as, central, government, sought, to, restrict, the, city, s, growth, and, disperse, industry, and, population, to, the, stagnating, areas, of, wales, and, northern, england, these, measures, hindered, the, natural, self, regeneration, of, businesses, in, birmingham, leaving, it, top, heavy, with, the, old, and, infirm, and, the, city, became, increasingly, dependent, on, the, motor, industry, the, recession, of, the, early, 1980s, saw, birmingham, s, economy, collapse, with, unprecedented, levels, of, unemployment, and, outbreaks, of, social, unrest, in, inner, city, districts, since, the, turn, of, the, 21st, century, many, parts, of, birmingham, have, been, transformed, with, the, redevelopment, of, the, bullring, shopping, centre, the, construction, of, the, new, library, of, birmingham, the, largest, public, library, in, europe, and, the,
