melanesia, uk, m, l, n, i, z, i, us, m, l, n, i, is, a, subregion, of, oceania, in, the, southwestern, pacific, ocean, it, extends, from, new, guinea, in, the, west, to, the, fiji, islands, in, the, east, and, includes, the, arafura, sea, the, region, includes, the, four, independent, countries, of, fiji, vanuatu, solomon, islands, and, papua, new, guinea, it, also, includes, the, indonesian, part, of, new, guinea, the, french, oversea, collectivity, of, new, caledonia, and, the, torres, strait, islands, almost, all, of, the, region, is, in, the, southern, hemisphere, only, a, few, small, islands, that, are, not, politically, considered, part, of, oceania, specifically, the, northwestern, islands, of, western, new, guinea, lie, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, name, melanesia, in, french, m, lan, sie, was, first, used, in, 1832, by, french, navigator, jules, dumont, d, urville, he, coined, the, terms, melanesia, and, micronesia, to, go, alongside, the, pre, existing, polynesia, to, designate, what, he, viewed, as, the, three, main, ethnic, and, geographical, regions, forming, the, pacific, the, indigenous, people, who, inhabit, the, islands, of, melanesia, are, called, melanesians, this, is, a, heterogenous, set, of, different, genetic, groups, and, ethnicities, different, cultural, practices, mythology, music, art, etc, and, different, unrelated, language, families, yet, together, they, form, a, vast, area, with, a, long, history, of, exchanges, the, name, melanesia, from, greek, black, and, island, etymologically, means, islands, of, black, in, reference, to, the, dark, skin, of, the, inhabitants, the, concept, among, europeans, of, melanesia, as, a, distinct, region, evolved, gradually, over, time, as, their, expeditions, mapped, and, explored, the, pacific, early, european, explorers, noted, the, physical, differences, among, groups, of, pacific, islanders, in, 1756, charles, de, brosses, theorized, that, there, was, an, old, black, race, in, the, pacific, who, had, been, conquered, or, defeated, by, the, peoples, of, what, is, now, called, polynesia, whom, he, distinguished, as, having, lighter, skin, 189, 190, in, the, first, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, jean, baptiste, bory, de, saint, vincent, and, jules, dumont, d, urville, characterized, melanesians, as, a, distinct, racial, group, 165, over, time, however, europeans, increasingly, viewed, melanesians, as, a, distinct, cultural, rather, than, racial, grouping, scholars, and, other, commentators, disagreed, on, the, boundaries, of, melanesia, descriptions, of, which, were, therefore, somewhat, fluid, in, the, nineteenth, century, robert, henry, codrington, a, british, missionary, produced, a, series, of, monographs, on, the, melanesians, based, on, his, long, time, residence, in, the, region, in, his, published, works, on, melanesia, including, the, melanesian, languages, 1885, and, the, melanesians, studies, in, their, anthropology, and, folk, lore, 1891, codrington, defined, melanesia, as, including, vanuatu, solomon, islands, new, caledonia, and, fiji, he, reasoned, that, the, islands, of, new, guinea, should, not, be, included, because, only, some, of, its, people, were, melanesians, also, like, bory, de, saint, vincent, he, excluded, australia, from, melanesia, 528, it, was, in, these, works, that, codrington, introduced, the, melanesian, cultural, concept, of, mana, to, the, west, uncertainty, about, the, best, way, to, delineate, and, define, the, region, continues, to, this, day, the, scholarly, consensus, now, includes, new, guinea, within, melanesia, ann, chowning, wrote, in, her, 1977, textbook, on, melanesia, that, there, is, no, general, agreement, even, among, anthropologists, about, the, geographical, boundaries, of, melanesia, many, apply, the, term, only, to, the, smaller, islands, excluding, new, guinea, fiji, has, frequently, been, treated, as, an, anomalous, border, region, or, even, assigned, wholly, to, polynesia, and, the, people, of, the, torres, straits, islands, are, often, simply, classified, as, australian, aborigines, 1, in, 1998, paul, sillitoe, wrote, it, is, not, easy, to, define, precisely, on, geographical, cultural, biological, or, any, other, grounds, where, melanesia, ends, and, the, neighbouring, regions, begins, 1, he, ultimately, concludes, that, the, region, is, a, historical, category, which, evolved, in, the, nineteenth, century, from, the, discoveries, made, in, the, pacific, and, has, been, legitimated, by, use, and, further, research, in, the, region, it, covers, populations, that, have, a, certain, linguistic, biological, and, cultural, affinity, a, certain, ill, defined, sameness, which, shades, off, at, its, margins, into, difference, 1, both, sillitoe, and, chowning, include, the, island, of, new, guinea, in, the, definition, of, melanesia, and, both, exclude, australia, most, of, the, peoples, of, melanesia, live, either, in, politically, independent, countries, or, in, regions, that, currently, have, active, independence, movements, such, as, in, western, new, guinea, indonesia, and, new, caledonia, france, some, have, recently, embraced, the, term, melanesia, as, a, source, of, identity, and, empowerment, stephanie, lawson, writes, that, despite, a, number, of, scholars, finding, the, term, problematic, due, to, its, historical, associations, with, european, exploration, and, colonisation, as, well, as, the, racism, embedded, in, these, the, term, has, acquired, a, positive, meaning, and, relevance, for, many, of, the, people, to, whom, it, applies, 1, and, has, moved, from, a, term, of, denigration, to, one, of, affirmation, providing, a, positive, basis, for, contemporary, subregional, identity, as, well, as, a, formal, organisation, 14, additionally, while, the, terms, polynesia, and, micronesia, refer, to, the, geographic, characteristics, of, the, islands, melanesia, specifically, refers, to, the, color, of, the, inhabitants, as, the, black, race, of, oceania, 4, the, author, bernard, narokobi, has, written, that, the, concept, of, the, melanesian, way, as, a, distinct, cultural, force, could, give, the, people, of, the, region, a, sense, of, empowerment, this, concept, has, in, fact, been, used, as, a, force, in, geopolitics, for, instance, when, the, countries, of, vanuatu, solomon, islands, papua, new, guinea, and, fiji, reached, a, regional, preferential, trade, agreement, they, named, it, the, melanesian, spearhead, group, the, people, of, melanesia, have, a, distinctive, ancestry, according, to, the, southern, dispersal, theory, hominid, populations, from, africa, dispersed, along, the, southern, edge, of, asia, some, 50, 000, to, 100, 000, years, ago, for, some, the, endpoint, of, this, ancient, migration, was, the, ancient, continent, of, sahul, a, single, landmass, comprising, both, the, areas, that, are, now, australia, and, new, guinea, at, that, time, they, were, united, by, a, land, bridge, because, sea, levels, were, lower, than, in, the, present, day, the, first, migration, into, sahul, was, over, 40, 000, years, ago, some, migrants, settled, in, the, part, that, is, now, new, guinea, while, others, continued, south, and, became, the, aboriginal, inhabitants, of, australia, another, wave, of, austronesian, migrants, originating, ultimately, from, taiwan, arrived, in, melanesia, much, later, probably, between, 4000, and, 3000, bc, they, settled, mostly, along, the, north, coast, of, new, guinea, and, on, the, islands, to, its, north, and, east, when, they, arrived, they, came, into, contact, with, the, much, more, ancient, indigenous, papuan, speaking, peoples, some, late, 20th, century, scholars, developed, a, theory, known, as, the, polynesian, theory, that, there, then, followed, a, long, period, of, interaction, between, these, newcomers, and, the, pre, existing, inhabitants, that, led, to, many, complex, genetic, linguistic, and, cultural, mixing, and, other, changes, among, the, descendants, of, all, the, groups, this, theory, was, later, called, into, question, however, by, the, findings, of, a, genetic, study, published, by, temple, university, in, 2008, that, study, found, that, neither, polynesians, nor, micronesians, have, much, genetic, relation, to, melanesians, the, study, s, results, suggest, that, after, ancestors, of, the, polynesians, having, developed, sailing, outrigger, canoes, migrated, out, of, east, asia, they, moved, quickly, through, the, melanesian, area, mostly, without, settling, there, and, instead, continued, on, to, areas, east, of, melanesia, finally, settling, in, those, areas, the, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, they, left, few, descendants, in, melanesia, and, therefore, probably, only, intermixed, to, a, very, modest, degree, with, the, indigenous, populations, there, the, study, did, find, a, small, austronesian, genetic, signature, below, 20, in, some, of, the, melanesian, groups, who, speak, austronesian, languages, but, found, no, such, signature, at, all, in, papuan, speaking, groups, most, of, the, languages, of, melanesia, are, members, of, the, austronesian, language, family, or, one, of, the, numerous, papuan, languages, the, term, papuan, languages, refers, to, their, geographical, location, rather, than, implying, that, they, are, linguistically, related, in, fact, they, comprise, many, separate, language, families, by, one, count, there, are, 1, 319, languages, in, melanesia, scattered, across, a, small, amount, of, land, on, average, there, is, one, language, for, every, 716, square, kilometers, on, the, island, this, is, by, far, the, densest, collection, of, distinct, languages, on, earth, almost, three, times, as, dense, as, in, nigeria, a, country, famous, for, having, a, very, large, number, of, languages, in, a, very, compact, area, in, addition, to, the, many, indigenous, melanesian, languages, pidgins, and, creole, languages, have, developed, from, trade, and, cultural, interaction, within, the, area, and, with, the, wider, world, most, notable, among, these, are, tok, pisin, and, hiri, motu, in, papua, new, guinea, they, are, now, both, considered, distinct, creole, languages, use, of, tok, pisin, is, growing, it, is, sometimes, learned, as, a, first, language, above, all, by, multi, cultural, families, examples, of, other, melanesian, creoles, are, unserdeutsch, solomon, islands, pijin, bislama, and, papuan, malay, a, distinction, is, often, made, between, the, island, of, new, guinea, and, what, is, known, as, island, melanesia, which, consists, of, the, chain, of, archipelagos, islands, atolls, and, reefs, forming, the, outer, bounds, of, the, sheltered, oval, shaped, coral, sea, 5, this, includes, the, louisiade, archipelago, a, part, of, papua, new, guinea, the, bismarck, archipelago, a, part, of, papua, new, guinea, and, solomon, islands, and, the, santa, cruz, islands, a, part, of, the, country, called, solomon, islands, the, country, of, vanuatu, is, composed, of, the, new, hebrides, island, chain, and, in, the, past, new, hebrides, has, also, been, the, name, of, the, political, unit, located, on, the, islands, new, caledonia, is, composed, of, one, large, island, and, several, smaller, chains, including, the, loyalty, islands, the, nation, of, fiji, is, composed, of, two, main, islands, viti, levu, and, vanua, levu, and, smaller, islands, including, the, lau, islands, from, the, geological, point, of, view, the, island, of, new, guinea, is, part, of, the, australian, continent, new, caledonia, is, geologically, part, of, zealandia, and, so, is, norfolk, the, names, of, islands, in, melanesia, can, be, confusing, they, have, both, indigenous, and, european, names, national, boundaries, sometimes, cut, across, archipelagos, the, names, of, the, political, units, in, the, region, have, changed, over, time, and, sometimes, have, included, geographical, terms, for, example, the, island, of, makira, was, once, known, as, san, cristobal, the, name, given, to, it, by, spanish, explorers, it, is, in, the, country, solomon, islands, which, is, a, nation, state, and, not, a, contiguous, archipelago, the, border, of, papua, new, guinea, and, solomon, islands, separates, the, island, of, bougainville, from, the, nearby, islands, of, choiseul, although, bougainville, is, geographically, part, of, the, chain, of, islands, that, includes, choiseul, and, much, of, the, solomons, in, addition, to, the, islands, mentioned, above, there, are, many, smaller, islands, and, atolls, in, melanesia, these, include, norfolk, island, listed, above, has, archaeological, evidence, of, east, polynesian, rather, than, melanesian, settlement, rotuma, in, fiji, has, strong, affinities, culturally, and, ethnologically, to, polynesia, the, following, countries, are, considered, part, of, melanesia, melanesia, also, includes, several, melanesian, states, are, members, of, intergovernmental, and, regional, organizations, papua, new, guinea, fiji, solomon, islands, and, vanuatu, are, members, of, the, commonwealth, of, nations, and, are, also, members, of, the, melanesian, spearhead, group, melanesians, were, found, to, have, a, third, archaic, homo, species, along, with, their, denisovan, 3, 4, and, neanderthal, 2, ancestors, in, a, genetic, admixture, with, their, otherwise, modern, homo, sapiens, sapiens, genomes, the, frequent, occurrence, of, blond, hair, among, these, peoples, is, due, to, a, specific, random, mutation, different, from, the, mutation, that, led, to, blond, hair, in, peoples, indigenous, to, northern, regions, of, the, globe, this, is, evidence, that, the, genotype, and, phenotype, for, blond, hair, arose, at, least, twice, in, human, history, 9, s, 160, e, 9, s, 160, e, 9, 160
