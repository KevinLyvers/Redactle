coasts, either, in, the, capital, city, of, suva, or, in, smaller, urban, centres, such, as, nadi, where, tourism, is, the, major, local, industry, or, lautoka, where, the, sugar, cane, industry, is, dominant, the, interior, of, viti, levu, is, sparsely, inhabited, because, of, its, terrain, the, majority, of, fiji, s, islands, were, formed, by, volcanic, activity, starting, around, 150, million, years, ago, some, geothermal, activity, still, occurs, today, on, the, islands, of, vanua, levu, and, taveuni, the, geothermal, systems, on, viti, levu, are, non, volcanic, in, origin, and, have, low, temperature, surface, discharges, of, between, roughly, 35, and, 60, degrees, celsius, 95, and, 140, f, humans, have, lived, in, fiji, since, the, second, millennium, bc, first, austronesians, and, later, melanesians, with, some, polynesian, influences, europeans, first, visited, fiji, in, the, 17th, century, in, 1874, after, a, brief, period, in, which, fiji, was, an, independent, kingdom, the, british, established, the, colony, of, fiji, fiji, operated, as, a, crown, colony, until, 1970, when, it, gained, independence, and, became, known, as, the, dominion, of, fiji, in, 1987, following, a, series, of, coups, d, tat, the, military, government, that, had, taken, power, declared, it, a, republic, in, a, 2006, coup, commodore, frank, bainimarama, seized, power, in, 2009, the, fijian, high, court, ruled, that, the, military, leadership, was, unlawful, at, that, point, president, ratu, josefa, iloilo, whom, the, military, had, retained, as, the, nominal, head, of, state, formally, abrogated, the, 1997, constitution, and, re, appointed, bainimarama, as, interim, prime, minister, later, in, 2009, ratu, epeli, nailatikau, succeeded, iloilo, as, president, on, 17, september, 2014, after, years, of, delays, a, democratic, election, took, place, bainimarama, s, fijifirst, party, won, 59, 2, of, the, vote, and, international, observers, deemed, the, election, credible, fiji, has, one, of, the, most, developed, economies, in, the, pacific, through, its, abundant, forest, mineral, and, fish, resources, the, currency, is, the, fijian, dollar, with, the, main, sources, of, foreign, exchange, being, the, tourist, industry, remittances, from, fijians, working, abroad, bottled, water, exports, and, sugar, cane, the, ministry, of, local, government, and, urban, development, supervises, fiji, s, local, government, which, takes, the, form, of, city, and, town, councils, the, name, of, fiji, s, main, island, viti, levu, served, as, the, origin, of, the, name, fiji, though, the, common, english, pronunciation, is, based, on, that, of, fiji, s, island, neighbours, in, tonga, an, official, account, of, the, emergence, of, the, name, states, fijians, first, impressed, themselves, on, european, consciousness, through, the, writings, of, the, members, of, the, expeditions, of, cook, who, met, them, in, tonga, they, were, described, as, formidable, warriors, and, ferocious, cannibals, builders, of, the, finest, vessels, in, the, pacific, but, not, great, sailors, they, inspired, awe, amongst, the, tongans, and, all, their, manufactures, especially, bark, cloth, and, clubs, were, highly, valued, and, much, in, demand, they, called, their, home, viti, but, the, tongans, called, it, fisi, and, it, was, by, this, foreign, pronunciation, fiji, first, promulgated, by, captain, james, cook, that, these, islands, are, now, known, feejee, the, anglicised, spelling, of, the, tongan, pronunciation, occurred, in, accounts, and, other, writings, by, missionaries, and, other, travellers, visiting, fiji, until, the, late, 19th, century, pottery, art, from, fijian, towns, shows, that, fiji, was, settled, by, austronesian, peoples, by, at, least, 3500, to, 1000, bc, with, melanesians, following, around, a, thousand, years, later, although, there, are, still, many, open, questions, about, the, specific, dates, and, patterns, of, human, migration, it, is, believed, that, either, the, lapita, people, or, the, ancestors, of, the, polynesians, settled, the, islands, first, but, not, much, is, known, of, what, became, of, them, after, the, melanesians, arrived, the, old, culture, may, have, had, some, influence, on, the, new, one, and, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, some, of, the, migrants, moved, on, to, samoa, tonga, and, even, hawai, i, archeological, evidence, also, shows, signs, of, human, settlement, on, moturiki, island, beginning, at, least, by, 600, bc, and, possibly, as, far, back, as, 900, bc, although, some, aspects, of, fijian, culture, are, similar, to, the, melanesian, culture, of, the, western, pacific, fijian, culture, has, a, stronger, connection, to, the, older, polynesian, cultures, the, evidence, is, clear, that, there, was, trade, between, fiji, and, neighbouring, archipelagos, long, before, europeans, made, contact, with, fiji, in, the, 10th, century, the, tu, i, tonga, empire, was, established, in, tonga, and, fiji, came, within, its, sphere, of, influence, the, tongan, influence, brought, polynesian, customs, and, language, into, fiji, that, empire, began, to, decline, in, the, 13th, century, fiji, has, long, had, permanent, settlements, but, its, peoples, also, have, a, history, of, mobility, over, the, centuries, unique, fijian, cultural, practices, developed, fijians, constructed, large, elegant, watercraft, with, rigged, sails, called, drua, and, exported, some, to, tonga, fijians, also, developed, a, distinctive, style, of, village, architecture, consisting, of, communal, and, individual, bure, and, vale, housing, and, an, advanced, system, of, ramparts, and, moats, that, were, usually, constructed, around, the, more, important, settlements, pigs, were, domesticated, for, food, and, a, variety, of, agricultural, endeavors, such, as, banana, plantations, existed, from, an, early, stage, villages, were, supplied, with, water, brought, in, by, constructed, wooden, aqueducts, fijians, lived, in, societies, led, by, chiefs, elders, and, notable, warriors, spiritual, leaders, often, called, bete, were, also, important, cultural, figures, and, the, production, and, consumption, of, yaqona, was, part, of, their, ceremonial, and, community, rites, fijians, developed, a, monetary, system, where, the, polished, teeth, of, the, sperm, whale, called, tambua, became, an, active, currency, a, type, of, writing, existed, which, can, be, seen, today, in, various, petroglyphs, around, the, islands, fijians, developed, a, refined, masi, cloth, textile, industry, and, used, the, cloth, they, produced, to, make, sails, and, clothes, such, as, the, malo, and, the, liku, as, with, most, other, ancient, human, civilisations, warfare, or, preparation, for, warfare, was, an, important, part, of, everyday, life, in, pre, colonial, fiji, the, fijians, were, noted, for, their, distinctive, use, of, weapons, especially, war, clubs, fijians, used, many, different, types, of, clubs, that, can, be, broadly, divided, into, two, groups, two, handed, clubs, and, small, specialised, throwing, clubs, called, ula, with, the, arrival, of, europeans, in, the, 17th, century, and, european, colonization, in, the, late, 19th, century, many, elements, of, fijian, culture, were, either, repressed, or, modified, to, ensure, european, specifically, british, control, this, was, especially, the, case, with, respect, to, traditional, fijian, spiritual, beliefs, early, colonists, and, missionaries, pointed, to, the, practice, of, cannibalism, in, fiji, as, providing, a, moral, imperative, justifying, colonization, europeans, labelled, many, native, fijian, customs, as, debased, or, primitive, enabling, many, colonists, to, see, fiji, as, a, paradise, wasted, on, savage, cannibals, authors, such, as, deryck, scarr, have, perpetuated, 19th, century, claims, of, freshly, killed, corpses, piled, up, for, eating, and, ceremonial, mass, human, sacrifice, on, the, construction, of, new, houses, and, boats, in, fact, during, colonial, times, fiji, was, known, as, the, cannibal, isles, modern, archaeological, research, conducted, on, fijian, sites, has, shown, that, fijians, did, in, fact, practice, cannibalism, which, has, helped, modern, scholars, to, assess, the, accuracy, of, some, of, these, colonial, european, accounts, studies, conducted, by, scholars, including, degusta, cochrane, and, jones, provide, evidence, of, burnt, or, cut, human, skeletons, suggesting, that, cannibalism, was, practised, in, fiji, however, these, archaeological, accounts, indicate, that, cannibalistic, practices, were, likely, more, intermittent, and, less, ubiquitous, than, european, settlers, had, implied, it, appears, that, the, cannibalism, may, more, often, have, been, nonviolent, and, ritualistic, dutch, explorer, abel, tasman, was, the, first, known, european, visitor, to, fiji, sighting, the, northern, island, of, vanua, levu, and, the, north, taveuni, archipelago, in, 1643, while, looking, for, the, great, southern, continent, james, cook, the, british, navigator, visited, one, of, the, southern, lau, islands, in, 1774, it, was, not, until, 1789, however, that, the, islands, were, charted, and, plotted, when, william, bligh, the, castaway, captain, of, hms, bounty, passed, ovalau, and, sailed, between, the, main, islands, of, viti, levu, and, vanua, levu, en, route, to, batavia, in, what, is, now, indonesia, bligh, water, the, strait, between, the, two, main, islands, is, named, after, him, and, for, a, time, the, fiji, islands, were, known, as, the, bligh, islands, the, first, europeans, to, maintain, substantial, contact, with, the, fijians, were, sandalwood, merchants, whalers, and, beche, de, mer, sea, cucumber, traders, the, first, whaling, vessel, known, to, have, visited, was, the, ann, and, hope, in, 1799, and, she, was, followed, by, many, others, in, the, 19th, century, these, ships, came, for, drinking, water, food, and, firewood, and, later, for, men, to, help, man, their, ships, some, of, the, europeans, who, came, to, fiji, in, this, period, were, accepted, by, the, locals, and, were, allowed, to, stay, as, residents, by, the, 1820s, levuka, was, established, as, the, first, european, style, town, in, fiji, on, the, island, of, ovalau, the, market, for, beche, de, mer, in, china, was, lucrative, and, british, and, american, merchants, set, up, processing, stations, on, various, islands, local, fijians, were, utilised, to, collect, prepare, and, pack, the, product, which, would, then, be, shipped, to, asia, a, good, cargo, would, result, in, a, half, yearly, profit, of, around, 25, 000, for, the, dealer, the, fijian, workers, were, often, given, firearms, and, ammunition, as, an, exchange, for, their, labour, and, by, the, end, of, the, 1820s, most, of, the, fijian, chiefs, had, muskets, and, many, were, skilled, at, using, them, some, fijian, chiefs, soon, felt, confident, enough, with, their, new, weapons, to, forcibly, obtain, more, destructive, weaponry, from, the, europeans, in, 1834, men, from, viwa, and, bau, were, able, to, take, control, of, the, french, ship, l, amiable, josephine, and, use, its, cannon, against, their, enemies, on, the, rewa, river, although, they, later, ran, it, aground, christian, missionaries, like, david, cargill, also, arrived, in, the, 1830s, from, recently, converted, regions, such, as, tonga, and, tahiti, and, by, 1840, the, european, settlement, at, levuka, had, grown, to, about, 40, houses, with, former, whaler, david, whippey, being, a, notable, resident, the, religious, conversion, of, the, fijians, was, a, gradual, process, which, was, observed, first, hand, by, captain, charles, wilkes, of, the, united, states, exploring, expedition, wilkes, wrote, that, all, the, chiefs, seemed, to, look, upon, christianity, as, a, change, in, which, they, had, much, to, lose, and, little, to, gain, christianised, fijians, in, addition, to, forsaking, their, spiritual, beliefs, were, pressured, into, cutting, their, hair, short, adopting, the, sulu, form, of, dress, from, tonga, and, fundamentally, changing, their, marriage, and, funeral, traditions, this, process, of, enforced, cultural, change, was, called, lotu, intensification, of, conflict, between, the, cultures, increased, and, wilkes, was, involved, in, organising, a, large, punitive, expedition, against, the, people, of, malolo, he, ordered, an, attack, with, rockets, which, acted, as, makeshift, incendiary, devices, the, village, with, the, occupants, trapped, inside, quickly, became, an, inferno, with, wilkes, noting, that, the, shouts, of, men, were, intermingled, with, the, cries, and, shrieks, of, the, women, and, children, as, they, burnt, to, death, wilkes, demanded, the, survivors, should, sue, for, mercy, and, if, not, they, must, expect, to, be, exterminated, around, 57, to, 87, maloloan, people, were, killed, in, this, encounter, the, 1840s, was, a, time, of, conflict, where, various, fiji, clans, attempted, to, assert, dominance, over, each, other, eventually, a, warlord, named, seru, epenisa, cakobau, of, bau, island, was, able, to, become, a, powerful, influence, in, the, region, his, father, was, ratu, tanoa, visawaqa, the, vunivalu, a, chiefly, title, meaning, warlord, often, translated, also, as, paramount, chief, who, had, previously, subdued, much, of, western, fiji, cakobau, following, on, from, his, father, became, so, dominant, that, he, was, able, to, expel, the, europeans, from, levuka, for, five, years, over, a, dispute, about, their, giving, of, weapons, to, his, local, enemies, in, the, early, 1850s, cakobau, went, one, step, further, and, declared, war, on, all, christians, his, plans, were, thwarted, after, the, missionaries, in, fiji, received, support, from, the, already, converted, tongans, and, the, presence, of, a, british, warship, the, tongan, prince, enele, ma, afu, a, christian, had, established, himself, on, the, island, of, lakeba, in, 1848, forcibly, converting, the, local, people, to, the, methodist, church, cakobau, and, other, chiefs, in, the, west, of, fiji, regarded, ma, afu, as, a, threat, to, their, power, and, resisted, his, attempts, to, expand, tonga, s, dominion, cakobau, s, influence, however, began, to, wane, and, his, heavy, imposition, of, taxes, on, other, fijian, chiefs, who, saw, him, at, best, as, first, among, equals, caused, them, to, defect, from, him, around, this, time, the, united, states, also, became, interested, in, asserting, their, power, in, the, region, and, they, threatened, intervention, following, a, number, of, incidents, involving, their, consul, in, the, fiji, islands, john, brown, williams, in, 1849, williams, had, his, trading, store, looted, following, an, accidental, fire, caused, by, stray, cannon, fire, during, a, fourth, of, july, celebration, and, in, 1853, the, european, settlement, of, levuka, was, burnt, to, the, ground, williams, blamed, cakobau, for, both, these, incidents, and, the, u, s, representative, wanted, cakobau, s, capital, at, bau, destroyed, in, retaliation, a, naval, blockade, was, instead, set, up, around, the, island, which, put, further, pressure, on, cakobau, to, give, up, on, his, warfare, against, the, foreigners, and, their, christian, allies, finally, on, 30, april, 1854, cakobau, offered, his, soro, supplication, and, yielded, to, these, forces, he, underwent, the, lotu, and, converted, to, christianity, the, traditional, fijian, temples, in, bau, were, destroyed, and, the, sacred, nokonoko, trees, were, cut, down, cakobau, and, his, remaining, men, were, then, compelled, to, join, with, the, tongans, backed, by, the, americans, and, british, to, subjugate, the, remaining, chiefs, in, the, region, who, still, refused, to, convert, these, chiefs, were, soon, defeated, with, qaraniqio, of, the, rewa, being, poisoned, and, ratu, mara, of, kaba, being, hanged, in, 1855, after, these, wars, most, regions, of, fiji, except, for, the, interior, highland, areas, had, been, forced, into, giving, up, much, of, their, traditional, systems, and, were, now, vassals, of, western, interest, cakobau, was, retained, as, a, largely, symbolic, representative, of, a, few, fijian, peoples, and, was, allowed, to, take, the, ironic, and, self, proclaimed, title, of, tui, viti, king, of, fiji, but, the, overarching, control, now, lay, with, foreign, powers, the, rising, price, of, cotton, in, the, wake, of, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 1865, caused, an, influx, of, hundreds, of, settlers, to, fiji, in, the, 1860s, from, australia, and, the, united, states, in, order, to, obtain, land, and, grow, cotton, since, there, was, still, a, lack, of, functioning, government, in, fiji, these, planters, were, often, able, to, get, the, land, in, violent, or, fraudulent, ways, such, as, exchanging, weapons, or, alcohol, with, fijians, who, may, or, may, not, have, been, the, true, owners, although, this, made, for, cheap, land, acquisition, competing, land, claims, between, the, planters, became, problematic, with, no, unified, government, to, resolve, the, disputes, in, 1865, the, settlers, proposed, a, confederacy, of, the, seven, main, native, kingdoms, in, fiji, to, establish, some, sort, of, government, this, was, initially, successful, and, cakobau, was, elected, as, the, first, president, of, the, confederacy, with, the, demand, for, land, high, the, white, planters, started, to, push, into, the, hilly, interior, of, viti, levu, this, put, them, into, direct, confrontation, with, the, kai, colo, which, was, a, general, term, to, describe, the, various, fijian, clans, resident, to, these, inland, districts, the, kai, colo, were, still, living, a, mostly, traditional, lifestyle, they, were, not, christianised, and, they, were, not, under, the, rule, of, cakobau, or, the, confederacy, in, 1867, a, travelling, missionary, named, thomas, baker, was, killed, by, kai, colo, in, the, mountains, at, the, headwaters, of, the, sigatoka, river, the, acting, british, consul, john, bates, thurston, demanded, that, cakobau, lead, a, force, of, fijians, from, coastal, areas, to, suppress, the, kai, colo, cakobau, eventually, led, a, campaign, into, the, mountains, but, suffered, a, humiliating, loss, with, 61, of, his, fighters, being, killed, settlers, also, came, into, conflict, with, the, local, eastern, kai, colo, people, called, the, wainimala, thurston, called, in, the, australia, station, section, of, the, royal, navy, for, assistance, the, navy, duly, sent, commander, rowley, lambert, and, hms, challenger, to, conduct, a, punitive, mission, against, the, wainimala, an, armed, force, of, 87, men, shelled, and, burnt, the, village, of, deoka, and, a, skirmish, ensued, which, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, over, 40, wainimala, after, the, collapse, of, the, confederacy, enele, ma, afu, established, a, stable, administration, in, the, lau, islands, and, the, tongans, other, foreign, powers, such, as, the, united, states, were, considering, the, possibility, of, annexing, fiji, this, situation, was, not, appealing, to, many, settlers, almost, all, of, whom, were, british, subjects, from, australia, britain, however, refused, to, annex, the, country, and, a, compromise, was, needed, in, june, 1871, george, austin, woods, an, ex, lieutenant, of, the, royal, navy, managed, to, influence, cakobau, and, organise, a, group, of, like, minded, settlers, and, chiefs, into, forming, a, governing, administration, cakobau, was, declared, the, monarch, tui, viti, and, the, kingdom, of, fiji, was, established, most, fijian, chiefs, agreed, to, participate, and, even, ma, afu, chose, to, recognise, cakobau, and, participate, in, the, constitutional, monarchy, however, many, of, the, settlers, had, come, from, australia, where, negotiation, with, the, indigenous, people, almost, universally, involved, coercing, them, to, accept, very, unfavourable, terms, these, settlers, expectation, of, dominating, by, force, led, them, to, form, several, aggressive, racially, motivated, groups, such, as, the, british, subjects, mutual, protection, society, one, group, called, themselves, the, ku, klux, klan, in, homage, to, the, white, supremacist, group, in, america, however, when, respected, individuals, such, as, charles, st, julian, robert, sherson, swanston, and, john, bates, thurston, were, appointed, by, cakobau, a, degree, of, authority, was, established, with, the, rapid, increase, in, white, settlers, entering, the, country, the, desire, for, land, acquisition, also, intensified, once, again, conflict, with, the, kai, colo, in, the, interior, of, viti, levu, ensued, in, 1871, the, killing, of, two, settlers, near, the, ba, river, in, the, northwest, of, the, island, prompted, a, large, punitive, expedition, of, white, farmers, imported, slave, labourers, and, coastal, fijians, to, be, organised, this, group, of, around, 400, armed, vigilantes, including, veterans, of, the, u, s, civil, war, had, a, battle, with, the, kai, colo, near, the, village, of, cubu, in, which, both, sides, had, to, withdraw, the, village, was, destroyed, and, the, kai, colo, despite, being, armed, with, muskets, received, numerous, casualties, the, kai, colo, responded, by, making, frequent, raids, on, the, settlements, of, the, whites, and, christian, fijians, throughout, the, district, of, ba, likewise, in, the, east, of, the, island, on, the, upper, reaches, of, the, rewa, river, villages, were, burnt, and, many, kai, colo, were, shot, by, the, vigilante, settler, squad, called, the, rewa, rifles, although, the, cakobau, government, did, not, approve, of, the, settlers, taking, justice, into, their, own, hands, it, did, want, the, kai, colo, subjugated, and, their, land, sold, the, solution, was, to, form, an, army, robert, s, swanston, the, minister, for, native, affairs, in, the, kingdom, organised, the, training, and, arming, of, suitable, fijian, volunteers, and, prisoners, to, become, soldiers, in, what, was, variably, called, the, king, s, troops, or, the, native, regiment, in, a, similar, system, to, the, native, police, that, was, present, in, the, colonies, of, australia, two, white, settlers, james, harding, and, w, fitzgerald, were, appointed, as, the, head, officers, of, this, paramilitary, brigade, the, formation, of, this, force, did, not, sit, well, with, many, of, the, white, plantation, owners, as, they, did, not, trust, an, army, of, fijians, to, protect, their, interests, the, situation, intensified, further, in, early, 1873, when, the, burns, family, was, killed, by, a, kai, colo, raid, in, the, ba, river, area, the, cakobau, government, deployed, 50, king, s, troopers, to, the, region, under, the, command, of, major, fitzgerald, to, restore, order, the, local, whites, refused, their, posting, and, deployment, of, another, 50, troops, under, captain, harding, was, sent, to, emphasise, the, government, s, authority, to, prove, the, worth, of, the, native, regiment, this, augmented, force, went, into, the, interior, and, massacred, about, 170, kai, colo, people, at, na, korowaiwai, upon, returning, to, the, coast, the, force, was, met, by, the, white, settlers, who, still, saw, the, government, troops, as, a, threat, a, skirmish, between, the, government, s, troops, and, the, white, settlers, brigade, was, only, prevented, by, the, intervention, of, captain, william, cox, chapman, of, hms, dido, who, detained, the, settlers, leaders, forcing, the, group, to, disband, the, authority, of, the, king, s, troops, and, the, cakobau, government, to, crush, the, kai, colo, was, now, total, from, march, to, october, 1873, a, force, of, about, 200, king, s, troops, under, the, general, administration, of, swanston, with, around, 1, 000, coastal, fijian, and, white, volunteer, auxiliaries, led, a, campaign, throughout, the, highlands, of, viti, levu, to, annihilate, the, kai, colo, major, fitzgerald, and, major, h, c, thurston, the, brother, of, john, bates, thurston, led, a, two, pronged, attack, throughout, the, region, the, combined, forces, of, the, different, clans, of, the, kai, colo, made, a, stand, at, the, village, of, na, culi, the, kai, colo, were, defeated, with, dynamite, and, fire, being, used, to, flush, them, out, from, their, defensive, positions, amongst, the, mountain, caves, many, kai, colo, were, killed, and, one, of, the, main, leaders, of, the, hill, clans, ratu, dradra, was, forced, to, surrender, with, around, 2, 000, men, women, and, children, being, taken, prisoner, and, sent, to, the, coast, in, the, months, after, this, defeat, the, only, main, resistance, was, from, the, clans, around, the, village, of, nibutautau, major, thurston, crushed, this, resistance, in, the, two, months, following, the, battle, at, na, culi, villages, were, burnt, kai, colo, were, killed, and, a, further, large, number, of, prisoners, were, taken, about, 1, 000, of, the, prisoners, men, women, and, children, were, sent, to, levuka, where, some, were, hanged, and, the, rest, were, sold, into, slavery, and, forced, to, work, on, various, plantations, throughout, the, islands, the, blackbirding, era, began, in, fiji, in, 1865, when, the, first, new, hebridean, and, solomon, islands, labourers, were, transported, there, to, work, on, cotton, plantations, the, american, civil, war, had, cut, off, the, supply, of, us, cotton, to, the, international, market, when, the, union, blockaded, confederate, ports, cotton, cultivation, was, potentially, an, extremely, profitable, business, thousands, of, european, planters, flocked, to, fiji, to, establish, plantations, but, found, the, natives, unwilling, to, adapt, to, their, plans, they, sought, labour, from, the, melanesian, islands, on, 5, july, 1865, ben, pease, received, the, first, licence, to, provide, 40, labourers, from, the, new, hebrides, to, fiji, the, british, and, queensland, governments, tried, to, regulate, this, recruiting, and, transport, of, labour, melanesian, labourers, were, to, be, recruited, for, a, term, of, three, years, paid, three, pounds, per, year, issued, basic, clothing, and, given, access, to, the, company, store, for, supplies, most, melanesians, were, recruited, by, deceit, usually, being, enticed, aboard, ships, with, gifts, and, then, locked, up, in, 1875, the, chief, medical, officer, in, fiji, sir, william, macgregor, listed, a, mortality, rate, of, 540, out, of, every, 1, 000, labourers, after, the, expiry, of, the, three, year, contract, the, government, required, captains, to, transport, the, labourers, back, to, their, villages, but, most, ship, captains, dropped, them, off, at, the, first, island, they, sighted, off, the, fiji, waters, the, british, sent, warships, to, enforce, the, law, pacific, islanders, protection, act, 1872, 35, 36, vict, c, 19, but, only, a, small, proportion, of, the, culprits, were, prosecuted, a, notorious, incident, of, the, blackbirding, trade, was, the, 1871, voyage, of, the, brig, carl, organised, by, dr, james, patrick, murray, to, recruit, labourers, to, work, in, the, plantations, of, fiji, murray, had, his, men, reverse, their, collars, and, carry, black, books, to, appear, as, church, missionaries, when, islanders, were, enticed, to, a, religious, service, murray, and, his, men, would, produce, guns, and, force, the, islanders, onto, boats, during, the, voyage, murray, shot, about, 60, islanders, he, was, never, brought, to, trial, for, his, actions, as, he, was, given, immunity, in, return, for, giving, evidence, against, his, crew, members, the, captain, of, the, carl, joseph, armstrong, was, later, sentenced, to, death, in, addition, to, the, blackbirded, labour, from, other, pacific, islands, thousands, of, people, indigenous, to, the, fijian, archipelago, were, sold, into, slavery, on, the, plantations, as, the, white, settler, backed, cakobau, government, and, later, the, british, colonial, government, subjugated, areas, in, fiji, under, its, power, the, resultant, prisoners, of, war, were, regularly, sold, at, auction, to, the, planters, this, provided, a, source, of, revenue, for, the, government, and, also, dispersed, the, rebels, to, different, often, isolated, islands, where, the, plantations, were, located, the, land, that, was, occupied, by, these, people, before, they, became, slaves, was, then, also, sold, for, additional, revenue, an, example, of, this, is, the, lovoni, people, of, ovalau, who, after, being, defeated, in, a, war, with, the, cakobau, government, in, 1871, were, rounded, up, and, sold, to, the, settlers, at, 6, per, head, two, thousand, lovoni, men, women, and, children, were, sold, and, their, period, of, slavery, lasted, five, years, likewise, after, the, kai, colo, wars, in, 1873, thousands, of, people, from, the, hill, tribes, of, viti, levu, were, sent, to, levuka, and, sold, into, slavery, warnings, from, the, royal, navy, stationed, in, the, area, that, buying, these, people, was, illegal, were, largely, given, without, enforcement, and, the, british, consul, in, fiji, edward, bernard, marsh, regularly, turned, a, blind, eye, to, this, type, of, labour, trade, despite, achieving, military, victories, over, the, kai, colo, the, cakobau, government, was, faced, with, problems, of, legitimacy, and, economic, viability, indigenous, fijians, and, white, settlers, refused, to, pay, taxes, and, the, cotton, price, had, collapsed, with, these, major, issues, in, mind, john, bates, thurston, approached, the, british, government, at, cakobau, s, request, with, another, offer, to, cede, the, islands, the, newly, elected, tory, british, government, under, benjamin, disraeli, encouraged, expansion, of, the, empire, and, was, therefore, much, more, sympathetic, to, annexing, fiji, than, it, had, been, previously, the, murder, of, bishop, john, patteson, of, the, melanesian, mission, at, nukapu, in, the, reef, islands, had, provoked, public, outrage, which, was, compounded, by, the, massacre, by, crew, members, of, more, than, 150, fijians, on, board, the, brig, carl, two, british, commissioners, were, sent, to, fiji, to, investigate, the, possibility, of, an, annexation, the, question, was, complicated, by, maneuverings, for, power, between, cakobau, and, his, old, rival, ma, afu, with, both, men, vacillating, for, many, months, on, 21, march, 1874, cakobau, made, a, final, offer, which, the, british, accepted, on, 23, september, sir, hercules, robinson, soon, to, be, appointed, the, british, governor, of, fiji, arrived, on, hms, dido, and, received, cakobau, with, a, royal, 21, gun, salute, after, some, vacillation, cakobau, agreed, to, renounce, his, tui, viti, title, retaining, the, title, of, vunivalu, or, protector, the, formal, cession, took, place, on, 10, october, 1874, when, cakobau, ma, afu, and, some, of, the, senior, chiefs, of, fiji, signed, two, copies, of, the, deed, of, cession, thus, the, colony, of, fiji, was, founded, 96, years, of, british, rule, followed, to, celebrate, the, annexation, of, fiji, hercules, robinson, who, was, governor, of, new, south, wales, at, the, time, took, cakobau, and, his, two, sons, to, sydney, there, was, a, measles, outbreak, in, that, city, and, the, three, fijians, all, came, down, with, the, disease, on, returning, to, fiji, the, colonial, administrators, decided, not, to, quarantine, the, ship, on, which, the, convalescents, travelled, this, was, despite, the, british, having, a, very, extensive, knowledge, of, the, devastating, effect, of, infectious, disease, on, an, unexposed, population, in, 1875, 76, the, resulting, epidemic, of, measles, killed, over, 40, 000, fijians, about, one, third, of, the, fijian, population, some, fijians, allege, that, this, failure, of, quarantine, was, a, deliberate, action, to, introduce, the, disease, into, the, country, historians, have, found, no, such, evidence, the, disease, spread, before, the, new, british, governor, and, colonial, medical, officers, had, arrived, and, no, quarantine, rules, existed, under, the, outgoing, regime, robinson, was, replaced, as, governor, of, fiji, in, june, 1875, by, sir, arthur, hamilton, gordon, gordon, was, immediately, faced, with, an, insurgency, of, the, qalimari, and, kai, colo, people, in, early, 1875, colonial, administrator, edgar, leopold, layard, had, met, with, thousands, of, highland, clans, at, navuso, to, formalise, their, subjugation, to, british, rule, and, christianity, layard, and, his, delegation, managed, to, spread, the, measles, epidemic, to, the, highlanders, causing, mass, deaths, in, this, population, as, a, result, anger, at, the, british, colonists, flared, throughout, the, region, and, a, widespread, uprising, quickly, took, hold, villages, along, the, sigatoka, river, and, in, the, highlands, above, this, area, refused, british, control, and, gordon, was, tasked, with, quashing, this, rebellion, in, what, gordon, termed, the, little, war, the, suppression, of, this, uprising, took, the, form, of, two, co, ordinated, military, campaigns, in, the, western, half, of, viti, levu, the, first, was, conducted, by, gordon, s, second, cousin, arthur, john, lewis, gordon, against, the, qalimari, insurgents, along, the, sigatoka, river, the, second, campaign, was, led, by, louis, knollys, against, the, kai, colo, in, the, mountains, to, the, north, of, the, river, governor, gordon, invoked, a, type, of, martial, law, in, the, area, where, arthur, john, lewis, gordon, and, knollys, had, absolute, power, to, conduct, their, missions, outside, of, any, restrictions, of, legislation, the, two, groups, of, rebels, were, kept, isolated, from, each, other, by, a, force, led, by, walter, carew, and, george, le, hunte, who, were, stationed, at, nasaucoko, carew, also, ensured, the, rebellion, did, not, spread, east, by, securing, the, loyalty, of, the, wainimala, people, of, the, eastern, highlands, the, war, involved, the, use, of, the, soldiers, of, the, old, native, regiment, of, cakobau, supported, by, around, 1, 500, christian, fijian, volunteers, from, other, areas, of, viti, levu, the, colonial, new, zealand, government, provided, most, of, the, advanced, weapons, for, the, army, including, 100, snider, rifles, the, campaign, along, the, sigatoka, river, was, conducted, under, a, scorched, earth, policy, whereby, numerous, rebel, villages, were, burnt, and, their, fields, ransacked, after, the, capture, and, destruction, of, the, main, fortified, towns, of, koroivatuma, bukutia, and, matanavatu, the, qalimari, surrendered, en, masse, those, not, killed, in, the, fighting, were, taken, prisoner, and, sent, to, the, coastal, town, of, cuvu, this, included, 827, men, women, and, children, as, well, as, mudu, the, leader, of, the, insurgents, the, women, and, children, were, distributed, to, places, like, nadi, and, nadroga, of, the, men, 15, were, sentenced, to, death, at, a, hastily, conducted, trial, at, sigatoka, governor, gordon, was, present, but, chose, to, leave, the, judicial, responsibility, to, his, relative, arthur, john, lewis, gordon, four, were, hanged, and, ten, including, mudu, were, shot, with, one, prisoner, managing, to, escape, by, the, end, of, proceedings, the, governor, noted, that, my, feet, were, literally, stained, with, the, blood, that, i, had, shed, the, northern, campaign, against, the, kai, colo, in, the, highlands, was, similar, but, involved, removing, the, rebels, from, large, well, protected, caves, in, the, region, knollys, managed, to, clear, the, caves, after, some, considerable, time, and, large, expenditure, of, ammunition, the, occupants, of, these, caves, included, whole, communities, and, as, a, result, many, men, women, and, children, were, either, killed, or, wounded, in, these, operations, the, rest, were, taken, prisoner, and, sent, to, the, towns, on, the, northern, coast, the, chief, medical, officer, in, british, fiji, william, macgregor, also, took, part, both, in, killing, kai, colo, and, tending, to, their, wounded, after, the, caves, were, taken, the, kai, colo, surrendered, and, their, leader, bisiki, was, captured, various, trials, were, held, mostly, at, nasaucoko, under, le, hunte, and, 32, men, were, either, hanged, or, shot, including, bisiki, who, was, killed, trying, to, escape, by, the, end, of, october, 1876, the, little, war, was, over, and, gordon, had, succeeded, in, vanquishing, the, rebels, in, the, interior, of, viti, levu, remaining, insurgents, were, sent, into, exile, with, hard, labour, for, up, to, 10, years, some, non, combatants, were, allowed, to, return, to, rebuild, their, villages, but, many, areas, in, the, highlands, were, ordered, by, gordon, to, remain, depopulated, and, in, ruins, gordon, also, constructed, a, military, fortress, fort, canarvon, at, the, headwaters, of, the, sigatoka, river, where, a, large, contingent, of, soldiers, were, based, to, maintain, british, control, he, renamed, the, native, regiment, the, armed, native, constabulary, to, lessen, its, appearance, of, being, a, military, force, to, further, consolidate, social, control, throughout, the, colony, governor, gordon, introduced, a, system, of, appointed, chiefs, and, village, constables, in, the, various, districts, to, both, enact, his, orders, and, report, any, disobedience, from, the, populace, gordon, adopted, the, chiefly, titles, roko, and, buli, to, describe, these, deputies, and, established, a, great, council, of, chiefs, which, was, directly, subject, to, his, authority, as, supreme, chief, this, body, remained, in, existence, until, being, suspended, by, the, military, backed, interim, government, in, 2007, and, only, abolished, in, 2012, gordon, also, extinguished, the, ability, of, fijians, to, own, buy, or, sell, land, as, individuals, the, control, being, transferred, to, colonial, authorities, gordon, decided, in, 1878, to, import, indentured, labourers, from, india, to, work, on, the, sugarcane, fields, that, had, taken, the, place, of, the, cotton, plantations, the, 463, indians, arrived, on, 14, may, 1879, the, first, of, some, 61, 000, that, were, to, come, before, the, scheme, ended, in, 1916, the, plan, involved, bringing, the, indian, workers, to, fiji, on, a, five, year, contract, after, which, they, could, return, to, india, at, their, own, expense, if, they, chose, to, renew, their, contract, for, a, second, five, year, term, they, would, be, given, the, option, of, returning, to, india, at, the, government, s, expense, or, remaining, in, fiji, the, great, majority, chose, to, stay, the, queensland, act, which, regulated, indentured, labour, in, queensland, was, made, law, in, fiji, also, between, 1879, and, 1916, tens, of, thousands, of, indians, moved, to, fiji, to, work, as, indentured, labourers, especially, on, sugarcane, plantations, given, the, steady, influx, of, ships, carrying, indentured, indians, to, fiji, up, until, 1916, repatriated, indians, generally, boarded, these, same, ships, on, their, return, voyage, the, total, number, of, repatriates, under, the, fiji, indenture, system, is, recorded, as, 39, 261, while, the, number, of, arrivals, is, said, to, have, been, 60, 553, because, the, return, figure, includes, children, born, in, fiji, many, of, the, indentured, indians, never, returned, to, india, with, almost, all, aspects, of, indigenous, fijian, social, life, being, controlled, by, the, british, colonial, authorities, a, number, of, charismatic, individuals, preaching, dissent, and, return, to, pre, colonial, culture, were, able, to, forge, a, following, amongst, the, disenfranchised, these, movements, were, called, tuka, which, roughly, translates, as, those, who, stand, up, the, first, tuka, movement, was, led, by, ndoongumoy, better, known, as, navosavakandua, which, means, he, who, speaks, only, once, he, told, his, followers, that, if, they, returned, to, traditional, ways, and, worshipped, traditional, deities, such, as, degei, and, rokola, their, current, condition, would, be, transformed, with, the, whites, and, their, puppet, fijian, chiefs, being, subservient, to, them, navosavakandua, was, previously, exiled, from, the, viti, levu, highlands, in, 1878, for, disturbing, the, peace, and, the, british, quickly, arrested, him, and, his, followers, after, this, open, display, of, rebellion, he, was, again, exiled, this, time, to, rotuma, where, he, died, soon, after, his, 10, year, sentence, ended, other, tuka, organisations, however, soon, appeared, the, british, colonial, administration, ruthlessly, suppressed, both, the, leaders, and, followers, with, figureheads, such, as, sailose, being, banished, to, an, asylum, for, 12, years, in, 1891, entire, populations, of, villages, who, were, sympathetic, to, the, tuka, ideology, were, deported, as, punishment, three, years, later, in, the, highlands, of, vanua, levu, where, locals, had, re, engaged, in, traditional, religion, governor, thurston, ordered, in, the, armed, native, constabulary, to, destroy, the, towns, and, the, religious, relics, leaders, were, jailed, and, villagers, exiled, or, forced, to, amalgamate, into, government, run, communities, later, in, 1914, apolosi, nawai, came, to, the, forefront, of, fijian, tuka, resistance, by, founding, viti, kabani, a, co, operative, company, that, would, legally, monopolise, the, agricultural, sector, and, boycott, european, planters, the, british, and, their, proxy, council, of, chiefs, were, not, able, to, prevent, the, viti, kabani, s, rise, and, again, the, colonists, were, forced, to, send, in, the, armed, native, constabulary, apolosi, and, his, followers, were, arrested, in, 1915, and, the, company, collapsed, in, 1917, over, the, next, 30, years, apolosi, was, re, arrested, jailed, and, exiled, with, the, british, viewing, him, as, a, threat, right, up, to, his, death, in, 1946, fiji, was, only, peripherally, involved, in, world, war, i, one, memorable, incident, occurred, in, september, 1917, when, count, felix, von, luckner, arrived, at, wakaya, island, off, the, eastern, coast, of, viti, levu, after, his, raider, sms, seeadler, had, run, aground, in, the, cook, islands, following, the, shelling, of, papeete, in, the, french, colony, of, tahiti, on, 21, september, the, district, police, inspector, took, a, number, of, fijians, to, wakaya, and, von, luckner, not, realising, that, they, were, unarmed, unwittingly, surrendered, citing, unwillingness, to, exploit, the, fijian, people, the, colonial, authorities, did, not, permit, fijians, to, enlist, one, fijian, of, chiefly, rank, a, great, grandson, of, cakobau, joined, the, french, foreign, legion, and, received, france, s, highest, military, decoration, the, croix, de, guerre, after, going, on, to, complete, a, law, degree, at, oxford, university, this, same, chief, returned, to, fiji, in, 1921, as, both, a, war, hero, and, the, country, s, first, ever, university, graduate, in, the, years, that, followed, ratu, sir, lala, sukuna, as, he, was, later, known, established, himself, as, the, most, powerful, chief, in, fiji, and, forged, embryonic, institutions, for, what, would, later, become, the, modern, fijian, nation, by, the, time, of, world, war, ii, the, united, kingdom, had, reversed, its, policy, of, not, enlisting, natives, and, many, thousands, of, fijians, volunteered, for, the, fiji, infantry, regiment, which, was, under, the, command, of, ratu, sir, edward, cakobau, another, great, grandson, of, cakobau, the, regiment, was, attached, to, new, zealand, and, australian, army, units, during, the, war, because, of, its, central, location, fiji, was, selected, as, a, training, base, for, the, allies, an, airstrip, was, built, at, nadi, later, to, become, an, international, airport, and, gun, emplacements, studded, the, coast, fijians, gained, a, reputation, for, bravery, in, the, solomon, islands, campaign, with, one, war, correspondent, describing, their, ambush, tactics, as, death, with, velvet, gloves, corporal, sefanaia, sukanaivalu, of, yucata, was, posthumously, awarded, the, victoria, cross, as, a, result, of,

responsible, government, indo, fijians, led, by, a, d, patel, demanded, the, immediate, introduction, of, full, self, government, with, a, fully, elected, legislature, to, be, elected, by, universal, suffrage, on, a, common, voters, roll, these, demands, were, vigorously, rejected, by, the, ethnic, fijian, delegation, who, still, feared, loss, of, control, over, natively, owned, land, and, resources, should, an, indo, fijian, dominated, government, come, to, power, the, british, made, it, clear, however, that, they, were, determined, to, bring, fiji, to, self, government, and, eventual, independence, realizing, that, they, had, no, choice, fiji, s, chiefs, decided, to, negotiate, for, the, best, deal, they, could, get, a, series, of, compromises, led, to, the, establishment, of, a, cabinet, system, of, government, in, 1967, with, ratu, kamisese, mara, as, the, first, chief, minister, ongoing, negotiations, between, mara, and, sidiq, koya, who, had, taken, over, the, leadership, of, the, mainly, indo, fijian, national, federation, party, on, patel, s, death, in, 1969, led, to, a, second, constitutional, conference, in, london, in, april, 1970, at, which, fiji, s, legislative, council, agreed, on, a, compromise, electoral, formula, and, a, timetable, for, independence, as, a, fully, sovereign, and, independent, nation, within, the, commonwealth, the, legislative, council, would, be, replaced, with, a, bicameral, parliament, with, a, senate, dominated, by, fijian, chiefs, and, a, popularly, elected, house, of, representatives, in, the, 52, member, house, native, fijians, and, indo, fijians, would, each, be, allocated, 22, seats, of, which, 12, would, represent, communal, constituencies, comprising, voters, registered, on, strictly, ethnic, roles, and,
