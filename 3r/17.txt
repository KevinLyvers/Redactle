a, globe, is, a, spherical, model, of, earth, of, some, other, celestial, body, or, of, the, celestial, sphere, globes, serve, purposes, similar, to, maps, but, unlike, maps, they, do, not, distort, the, surface, that, they, portray, except, to, scale, it, down, a, model, globe, of, earth, is, called, a, terrestrial, globe, a, model, globe, of, the, celestial, sphere, is, called, a, celestial, globe, a, globe, shows, details, of, its, subject, a, terrestrial, globe, shows, landmasses, and, water, bodies, it, might, show, nations, and, major, cities, and, the, network, of, latitude, and, longitude, lines, some, have, raised, relief, to, show, mountains, and, other, large, landforms, a, celestial, globe, shows, notable, stars, and, may, also, show, positions, of, other, prominent, astronomical, objects, typically, it, will, also, divide, the, celestial, sphere, into, constellations, the, word, globe, comes, from, the, latin, word, globus, meaning, sphere, globes, have, a, long, history, the, first, known, mention, of, a, globe, is, from, strabo, describing, the, globe, of, crates, from, about, 150, bc, the, oldest, surviving, terrestrial, globe, is, the, erdapfel, made, by, martin, behaim, in, 1492, the, oldest, surviving, celestial, globe, sits, atop, the, farnese, atlas, carved, in, the, 2nd, century, roman, empire, flat, maps, are, created, using, a, map, projection, that, inevitably, introduces, an, increasing, amount, of, distortion, the, larger, the, area, that, the, map, shows, a, globe, is, the, only, representation, of, the, earth, that, does, not, distort, either, the, shape, or, the, size, of, large, features, land, masses, bodies, of, water, etc, the, earth, s, circumference, is, quite, close, to, 40, million, metres, many, globes, are, made, with, a, circumference, of, one, metre, so, they, are, models, of, the, earth, at, a, scale, of, 1, 40, million, in, imperial, units, many, globes, are, made, with, a, diameter, of, one, foot, about, 30, cm, yielding, a, circumference, of, 3, 14, feet, about, 96, cm, and, a, scale, of, 1, 42, million, globes, are, also, made, in, many, other, sizes, some, globes, have, surface, texture, showing, topography, or, bathymetry, in, these, elevations, and, depressions, are, purposely, exaggerated, as, they, otherwise, would, be, hardly, visible, for, example, one, manufacturer, produces, a, three, dimensional, raised, relief, globe, with, a, 64, cm, 25, in, diameter, equivalent, to, a, 200, cm, circumference, or, approximately, a, scale, of, 1, 20, million, showing, the, highest, mountains, as, over, 2, 5, cm, 1, in, tall, which, is, about, 57, times, higher, than, the, correct, scale, of, mount, everest, most, modern, globes, are, also, imprinted, with, parallels, and, meridians, so, that, one, can, tell, the, approximate, coordinates, of, a, specific, location, globes, may, also, show, the, boundaries, of, countries, and, their, names, many, terrestrial, globes, have, one, celestial, feature, marked, on, them, a, diagram, called, the, analemma, which, shows, the, apparent, motion, of, the, sun, in, the, sky, during, a, year, globes, generally, show, north, at, the, top, but, many, globes, allow, the, axis, to, be, swiveled, so, that, southern, portions, can, be, viewed, conveniently, this, capability, also, permits, exploring, the, earth, from, different, orientations, to, help, counter, the, north, up, bias, caused, by, conventional, map, presentation, celestial, globes, show, the, apparent, positions, of, the, stars, in, the, sky, they, omit, the, sun, moon, and, planets, because, the, positions, of, these, bodies, vary, relative, to, those, of, the, stars, but, the, ecliptic, along, which, the, sun, moves, is, indicated, in, their, most, basic, form, celestial, globes, represent, the, stars, as, if, the, viewer, were, looking, down, upon, the, sky, as, a, globe, that, surrounds, the, earth, the, sphericity, of, the, earth, was, established, by, greek, astronomy, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, the, earliest, terrestrial, globe, appeared, from, that, period, the, earliest, known, example, is, the, one, constructed, by, crates, of, mallus, in, cilicia, now, ukurova, in, modern, day, turkey, in, the, mid, 2nd, century, bc, no, terrestrial, globes, from, antiquity, have, survived, an, example, of, a, surviving, celestial, globe, is, part, of, a, hellenistic, sculpture, called, the, farnese, atlas, surviving, in, a, 2nd, century, ad, roman, copy, in, the, naples, archaeological, museum, italy, early, terrestrial, globes, depicting, the, entirety, of, the, old, world, were, constructed, in, the, islamic, world, during, the, middle, ages, in, christian, europe, while, there, are, writings, alluding, to, the, idea, that, the, earth, was, spherical, no, known, attempts, at, making, a, globe, took, place, before, the, fifteenth, century, the, earliest, extant, terrestrial, globe, was, made, in, 1492, by, martin, behaim, 1459, 1537, with, help, from, the, painter, georg, glockendon, behaim, was, a, german, mapmaker, navigator, and, merchant, working, in, nuremberg, germany, he, called, his, globe, the, n, rnberg, terrestrial, globe, it, is, now, known, as, the, erdapfel, before, constructing, the, globe, behaim, had, traveled, extensively, he, sojourned, in, lisbon, from, 1480, developing, commercial, interests, and, mingling, with, explorers, and, scientists, he, began, to, construct, his, globe, after, his, return, to, n, rnberg, in, 1490, china, made, many, mapping, advancements, such, as, sophisticated, land, surveys, and, the, invention, of, the, magnetic, compass, however, no, record, of, terrestrial, globes, in, china, exists, until, a, globe, was, introduced, by, the, persian, astronomer, jamal, ad, din, in, 1276, another, early, globe, the, hunt, lenox, globe, ca, 1510, is, thought, to, be, the, source, of, the, phrase, hic, sunt, dracones, or, here, be, dragons, a, similar, grapefruit, sized, globe, made, from, two, halves, of, an, ostrich, egg, was, found, in, 2012, and, is, believed, to, date, from, 1504, it, may, be, the, oldest, globe, to, show, the, new, world, stefaan, missine, who, analyzed, the, globe, for, the, washington, map, society, journal, portolan, said, it, was, part, of, an, important, european, collection, for, decades, after, a, year, of, research, in, which, he, consulted, many, experts, missine, concluded, the, hunt, lenox, globe, was, a, copper, cast, of, the, egg, globe, a, facsimile, globe, showing, america, was, made, by, martin, waldseem, ller, in, 1507, another, remarkably, modern, looking, terrestrial, globe, of, the, earth, was, constructed, by, taqi, al, din, at, the, constantinople, observatory, of, taqi, ad, din, during, the, 1570s, the, world, s, first, seamless, celestial, globe, was, built, by, mughal, scientists, under, the, patronage, of, jahangir, globus, imp, electro, mechanical, devices, including, five, inch, globes, have, been, used, in, soviet, and, russian, spacecraft, from, 1961, to, 2002, as, navigation, instruments, in, 2001, the, tma, version, of, the, soyuz, spacecraft, replaced, this, instrument, with, a, digital, map, traditionally, globes, were, manufactured, by, gluing, a, printed, paper, map, onto, a, sphere, often, made, from, wood, the, most, common, type, has, long, thin, gores, strips, of, paper, that, narrow, to, a, point, at, the, poles, small, disks, cover, over, the, inevitable, irregularities, at, these, points, the, more, gores, there, are, the, less, stretching, and, crumpling, is, required, to, make, the, paper, map, fit, the, sphere, this, method, of, globe, making, was, illustrated, in, 1802, in, an, engraving, in, the, english, encyclopedia, by, george, kearsley, modern, globes, are, often, made, from, thermoplastic, flat, plastic, disks, are, printed, with, a, distorted, map, of, one, of, the, earth, s, hemispheres, this, is, placed, in, a, machine, which, molds, the, disk, into, a, hemispherical, shape, the, hemisphere, is, united, with, its, opposite, counterpart, to, form, a, complete, globe, usually, a, globe, is, mounted, so, that, its, rotation, axis, is, 23, 5, 0, 41, rad, from, vertical, which, is, the, angle, the, earth, s, rotation, axis, deviates, from, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, its, orbit, this, mounting, makes, it, easy, to, visualize, how, seasons, change, in, the, 1800s, small, pocket, globes, less, than, 3, inches, were, status, symbols, for, gentlemen, and, educational, toys, for, rich, children, sorted, in, decreasing, sizes
