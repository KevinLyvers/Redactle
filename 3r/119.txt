the, dead, sea, arabic, romanized, al, ba, r, al, mayyit, or, al, ba, r, al, mayt, hebrew, romanized, y, m, hammela, also, known, by, other, names, is, a, landlocked, salt, lake, bordered, by, jordan, to, the, east, the, israeli, occupied, west, bank, to, the, west, and, israel, to, the, southwest, it, lies, in, the, jordan, rift, valley, and, its, main, tributary, is, the, jordan, river, as, of, 2019, the, lake, s, surface, is, 430, 5, metres, 1, 412, ft, below, sea, level, making, its, shores, the, lowest, land, based, elevation, on, earth, it, is, 304, m, 997, ft, deep, the, deepest, hypersaline, lake, in, the, world, with, a, salinity, of, 342, g, kg, or, 34, 2, in, 2011, it, is, one, of, the, world, s, saltiest, bodies, of, water, 9, 6, times, as, salty, as, the, ocean, and, has, a, density, of, 1, 24, kg, litre, which, makes, swimming, similar, to, floating, this, salinity, makes, for, a, harsh, environment, in, which, plants, and, animals, cannot, flourish, hence, its, name, the, dead, sea, s, main, northern, basin, is, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, long, and, 15, kilometres, 9, mi, wide, at, its, widest, point, the, dead, sea, has, attracted, visitors, from, around, the, mediterranean, basin, for, thousands, of, years, it, was, one, of, the, world, s, first, health, resorts, and, it, has, been, the, supplier, of, a, wide, variety, of, products, from, asphalt, for, egyptian, mummification, to, potash, for, fertilisers, today, tourists, visit, the, sea, on, its, israeli, jordanian, and, west, bank, coastlines, the, dead, sea, is, receding, at, a, swift, rate, its, surface, area, today, is, 605, km, 2, 234, sq, mi, having, been, 1, 050, km, 2, 410, sq, mi, in, 1930, multiple, canal, and, pipeline, proposals, such, as, the, scrapped, red, sea, dead, sea, water, conveyance, project, have, been, made, to, reduce, its, recession, the, english, name, dead, sea, is, a, calque, of, the, arabic, name, itself, a, calque, of, earlier, greek, and, latin, names, in, reference, to, the, scarcity, of, aquatic, life, caused, by, the, lake, s, extreme, salinity, historical, english, names, include, the, salt, sea, lake, of, sodom, from, the, biblical, account, of, its, destruction, and, lake, asphaltites, from, greek, and, latin, the, name, dead, sea, occasionally, appears, in, hebrew, literature, as, y, m, hamm, vet, sea, of, death, the, usual, biblical, and, modern, hebrew, name, for, the, lake, is, the, sea, of, salt, y, m, hammela, other, hebrew, names, for, the, lake, also, mentioned, in, the, bible, are, the, sea, of, arabah, y, m, ha, r, v, and, the, eastern, sea, hay, m, haqadm, n, the, arabic, name, is, al, bahr, al, mayyit, or, usually, without, the, article, al, so, just, bahr, etc, it, is, also, known, in, arabic, as, the, sea, of, lot, buhayrat, bahret, or, birket, lut, from, the, nephew, of, abraham, whose, wife, was, said, to, have, turned, into, a, pillar, of, salt, during, the, destruction, of, sodom, and, gomorrah, less, often, it, has, been, known, in, arabic, as, the, sea, of, zo, ar, from, a, formerly, important, city, along, its, shores, because, of, the, large, volume, of, ancient, trade, in, the, lake, s, naturally, occurring, free, floating, bitumen, its, usual, names, in, ancient, greek, and, roman, geography, were, some, form, of, asphalt, lake, greek, or, asphalt, t, s, or, asphalt, tis, l, mn, latin, lacus, asphaltites, or, sea, asphalt, t, s, th, lassa, it, was, also, known, as, the, dead, sea, greek, nekr, th, lassa, latin, mare, mortuum, the, dead, sea, is, a, salt, lake, is, bordered, by, jordan, to, the, east, and, palestine, s, israeli, occupied, west, bank, and, israel, to, the, west, it, is, an, endorheic, lake, meaning, there, are, no, outlet, streams, the, dead, sea, lies, in, the, jordan, rift, valley, a, geographic, feature, formed, by, the, dead, sea, transform, dst, this, left, lateral, moving, transform, fault, lies, along, the, tectonic, plate, boundary, between, the, african, plate, and, the, arabian, plate, it, runs, between, the, east, anatolian, fault, zone, in, turkey, and, the, northern, end, of, the, red, sea, rift, offshore, of, the, southern, tip, of, sinai, water, feeds, into, the, dead, sea, from, various, sources, many, small, or, intermittent, including, wadi, is, the, arabic, term, for, a, river, valley, with, a, small, or, intermittent, stream, nahal, is, the, equivalent, in, hebrew, the, two, terms, are, often, used, interchangeably, in, english, names, for, the, same, body, of, water, the, water, of, wadi, hassa, is, now, completely, consumed, in, jordan, the, jordan, river, which, passes, through, the, sea, of, galilee, has, been, substantially, diverted, it, currently, only, contributes, about, one, sixth, of, the, inflow, to, the, dead, sea, less, than, direct, rainfall, there, are, also, small, perennial, springs, under, and, around, the, dead, sea, forming, pools, and, quicksand, pits, along, the, edges, the, wadi, mujib, valley, 420, m, below, the, sea, level, in, the, southern, part, of, the, jordan, valley, is, a, biosphere, reserve, with, an, area, of, 212, km, 2, 82, sq, mi, rainfall, is, scarcely, 100, mm, 4, in, per, year, in, the, northern, part, of, the, dead, sea, and, barely, 50, mm, 2, in, in, the, southern, part, the, dead, sea, zone, s, aridity, is, due, to, the, rainshadow, effect, of, the, judaean, mountains, the, highlands, east, of, the, dead, sea, receive, more, rainfall, than, the, dead, sea, itself, to, the, west, of, the, dead, sea, the, judaean, mountains, rise, less, steeply, and, are, much, lower, than, the, mountains, to, the, east, along, the, southwestern, side, of, the, lake, is, a, 210, m, 700, ft, tall, halite, mineral, formation, called, mount, sodom, there, are, two, contending, hypotheses, about, the, origin, of, the, low, elevation, of, the, dead, sea, the, older, hypothesis, is, that, the, dead, sea, lies, in, a, true, rift, zone, an, extension, of, the, red, sea, rift, or, even, of, the, great, rift, valley, of, eastern, africa, a, more, recent, hypothesis, is, that, the, dead, sea, basin, is, a, consequence, of, a, step, over, discontinuity, along, the, dead, sea, transform, creating, an, extension, of, the, crust, with, consequent, subsidence, during, the, late, pliocene, early, pleistocene, what, is, now, the, valley, of, the, jordan, river, dead, sea, and, the, northern, wadi, arabah, was, repeatedly, inundated, by, waters, from, the, mediterranean, sea, the, waters, formed, in, a, narrow, crooked, bay, that, is, called, by, geologists, the, sedom, lagoon, which, was, connected, to, the, sea, through, what, is, now, the, jezreel, valley, the, floods, of, the, valley, came, and, went, depending, on, long, scale, changes, in, the, tectonic, and, climatic, conditions, the, sedom, lagoon, extended, at, its, maximum, from, the, sea, of, galilee, in, the, north, to, somewhere, around, 50, km, 30, mi, south, of, the, current, southern, end, of, the, dead, sea, and, the, subsequent, lakes, never, surpassed, this, expanse, the, hula, depression, was, never, part, of, any, of, these, water, bodies, due, to, its, higher, elevation, and, the, high, threshold, of, the, korazim, block, separating, it, from, the, sea, of, galilee, basin, the, sedom, lagoon, deposited, evaporites, mainly, consisting, of, rock, salt, which, eventually, reached, a, thickness, of, 2, 3, km, 1, 43, mi, on, the, old, basin, floor, in, the, area, of, today, s, mount, sedom, according, to, kafri, during, the, late, neogene, i, e, in, the, pliocene, ended, c, 2, 5, million, years, ago, the, eustatic, sea, level, was, at, 50, 100, metres, above, the, current, sea, level, thus, flooding, the, northern, valleys, connecting, the, mediterranean, sea, with, the, jordan, rift, valley, which, led, to, the, creation, of, a, crooked, shaped, lagoon, this, high, eustatic, sea, level, situation, subsequently, came, to, an, end, and, the, ocean, could, no, longer, flood, the, area, thus, the, long, lagoon, became, a, landlocked, lake, which, due, to, the, high, evaporation, rate, retreated, toward, the, lower, southern, part, of, the, rift, valley, however, mordechai, stein, considers, the, formation, process, as, not, yet, clarified, speaking, of, a, late, pliocene, early, pleistocene, process, in, which, tectonics, might, also, have, played, a, part, in, blocking, water, ingression, from, the, mediterranean, to, its, former, bay, or, lagoon, the, first, prehistoric, lake, to, follow, the, sedom, lagoon, is, named, lake, amora, which, possibly, appeared, in, the, early, pleistocene, its, sediments, developed, into, the, amora, samra, formation, dated, to, over, 200, 80, kyr, bp, followed, by, lake, lisan, c, 70, 14, kyr, and, finally, by, the, dead, sea, the, water, levels, and, salinity, of, the, successive, lakes, amora, lisan, dead, sea, have, either, risen, or, fallen, as, an, effect, of, the, tectonic, dropping, of, the, valley, bottom, and, due, to, climate, variation, as, the, climate, became, more, arid, lake, lisan, finally, shrank, and, became, saltier, leaving, the, dead, sea, as, its, last, remainder, from, 70, 000, to, 12, 000, years, ago, lake, lisan, s, level, was, 100, to, 250, m, 330, to, 820, ft, higher, than, its, current, level, possibly, due, to, lower, evaporation, than, in, the, present, its, level, fluctuated, dramatically, rising, to, its, highest, level, around, 26, 000, years, ago, indicating, a, very, wet, climate, in, the, near, east, around, 10, 000, years, ago, the, lake, s, level, dropped, dramatically, probably, even, lower, than, today, during, the, last, several, thousand, years, the, lake, has, fluctuated, approximately, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, with, some, significant, drops, and, rises, current, theories, as, to, the, cause, of, this, dramatic, drop, in, levels, rule, out, volcanic, activity, therefore, it, may, have, been, a, seismic, event, in, prehistoric, times, great, amounts, of, sediment, collected, on, the, floor, of, lake, amora, the, sediment, was, heavier, than, the, salt, deposits, and, squeezed, the, salt, deposits, upwards, into, what, are, now, the, lisan, peninsula, and, mount, sodom, on, the, southwest, side, of, the, lake, geologists, explain, the, effect, in, terms, of, a, bucket, of, mud, into, which, a, large, flat, stone, is, placed, forcing, the, mud, to, creep, up, the, sides, of, the, bucket, when, the, floor, of, the, dead, sea, dropped, further, due, to, tectonic, forces, the, salt, mounts, of, lisan, and, mount, sodom, stayed, in, place, as, high, cliffs, see, salt, dome, the, dead, sea, has, a, hot, desert, climate, k, ppen, climate, classification, bwh, with, year, round, sunny, skies, and, dry, air, it, has, less, than, 50, millimetres, 2, in, mean, annual, rainfall, and, a, summer, average, temperature, between, 32, and, 39, c, 90, and, 102, f, winter, average, temperatures, range, between, 20, and, 23, c, 68, and, 73, f, the, region, has, weaker, ultraviolet, radiation, particularly, the, uvb, erythrogenic, rays, given, the, higher, atmospheric, pressure, the, air, has, a, slightly, higher, oxygen, content, 3, 3, in, summer, to, 4, 8, in, winter, as, compared, to, oxygen, concentration, at, sea, level, barometric, pressures, at, the, dead, sea, were, measured, between, 1061, and, 1065, hpa, and, clinically, compared, with, health, effects, at, higher, altitude, this, barometric, measure, is, about, 5, higher, than, sea, level, standard, atmospheric, pressure, of, 1013, 25, hpa, which, is, the, global, ocean, mean, or, atm, the, dead, sea, affects, temperatures, nearby, because, of, the, moderating, effect, a, large, body, of, water, has, on, climate, during, the, winter, sea, temperatures, tend, to, be, higher, than, land, temperatures, and, vice, versa, during, the, summer, months, this, is, the, result, of, the, water, s, mass, and, specific, heat, capacity, on, average, there, are, 192, days, above, 30, c, 86, f, annually, with, 34, 2, salinity, in, 2011, it, is, one, of, the, world, s, saltiest, bodies, of, water, though, lake, vanda, in, antarctica, 35, lake, assal, in, djibouti, 34, 8, lagoon, garabogazk, l, in, the, caspian, sea, up, to, 35, and, some, hypersaline, ponds, and, lakes, of, the, mcmurdo, dry, valleys, in, antarctica, such, as, don, juan, pond, 44, have, reported, higher, salinities, in, the, 19th, century, and, the, early, 20th, century, the, surface, layers, of, the, dead, sea, were, less, salty, than, today, which, resulted, in, an, average, density, in, the, range, of, 1, 15, 1, 17, g, cm, 3, instead, of, the, present, value, of, around, 1, 25, g, cm, 3, a, sample, tested, by, bernays, in, the, 19th, century, had, a, salinity, of, 19, by, the, year, 1926, the, salinity, had, increased, although, it, was, also, suspected, that, the, salinity, varies, seasonally, and, depends, on, the, distance, from, the, mouth, of, the, jordan, until, the, winter, of, 1978, 79, when, a, major, mixing, event, took, place, the, dead, sea, was, composed, of, two, stratified, layers, of, water, that, differed, in, temperature, density, age, and, salinity, the, topmost, 35, meters, 115, ft, or, so, of, the, dead, sea, had, an, average, salinity, of, about, 30, and, a, temperature, that, swung, between, 19, and, 37, c, 66, and, 99, f, underneath, a, zone, of, transition, the, lowest, level, of, the, dead, sea, had, waters, of, a, consistent, 22, c, 72, f, temperature, salinity, of, over, 34, and, complete, saturation, of, sodium, chloride, nacl, since, the, water, near, the, bottom, is, saturated, with, nacl, that, salt, precipitates, out, of, solution, onto, the, sea, floor, beginning, in, the, 1960s, water, inflow, to, the, dead, sea, from, the, jordan, river, was, reduced, as, a, result, of, large, scale, irrigation, and, generally, low, rainfall, by, 1975, the, upper, water, layer, was, saltier, than, the, lower, layer, nevertheless, the, upper, layer, remained, suspended, above, the, lower, layer, because, its, waters, were, warmer, and, thus, less, dense, when, the, upper, layer, cooled, so, its, density, was, greater, than, the, lower, layer, the, waters, mixed, 1978, 79, for, the, first, time, in, centuries, the, lake, was, a, homogeneous, body, of, water, since, then, stratification, has, begun, to, redevelop, the, mineral, content, of, the, dead, sea, is, very, different, from, that, of, ocean, water, the, exact, composition, of, the, dead, sea, water, varies, mainly, with, season, depth, and, temperature, in, the, early, 1980s, the, concentration, of, ionic, species, in, g, kg, of, dead, sea, surface, water, was, cl, 181, 4, br, 4, 2, so, 4, 2, 0, 4, hco, 3, 0, 2, ca, 2, 14, 1, na, 32, 5, k, 6, 2, and, mg, 2, 35, 2, the, total, salinity, was, 276, g, kg, these, results, show, that, the, composition, of, the, salt, as, anhydrous, chlorides, on, a, weight, percentage, basis, was, calcium, chloride, cacl, 2, 14, 4, potassium, chloride, kcl, 4, 4, magnesium, chloride, mgcl, 2, 50, 8, and, sodium, chloride, nacl, 30, 4, in, comparison, the, salt, in, the, water, of, most, oceans, and, seas, is, approximately, 85, sodium, chloride, the, concentration, of, sulfate, ions, so, 4, 2, is, very, low, and, the, concentration, of, bromide, ions, br, is, the, highest, of, all, waters, on, earth, the, salt, concentration, of, the, dead, sea, fluctuates, around, 31, 5, this, is, unusually, high, and, results, in, a, nominal, density, of, 1, 24, kg, l, anyone, can, easily, float, in, the, dead, sea, because, of, natural, buoyancy, in, this, respect, the, dead, sea, is, similar, to, the, great, salt, lake, in, utah, in, the, united, states, an, unusual, feature, of, the, dead, sea, is, its, discharge, of, asphalt, from, deep, seeps, the, dead, sea, constantly, spits, up, small, pebbles, and, blocks, of, the, black, substance, asphalt, coated, figurines, and, bitumen, coated, neolithic, skulls, from, archaeological, sites, have, been, found, egyptian, mummification, processes, used, asphalt, imported, from, the, dead, sea, region, the, dead, sea, area, has, become, a, location, for, health, research, and, potential, treatment, for, several, reasons, the, mineral, content, of, the, water, the, low, content, of, pollens, and, other, allergens, in, the, atmosphere, the, reduced, ultraviolet, component, of, solar, radiation, and, the, higher, atmospheric, pressure, at, this, great, depth, each, may, have, specific, health, effects, for, example, persons, experiencing, reduced, respiratory, function, from, diseases, such, as, cystic, fibrosis, seem, to, benefit, from, the, increased, atmospheric, pressure, the, region, s, climate, and, low, elevation, have, made, it, a, popular, center, for, assessment, of, putative, therapies, there, is, evidence, that, the, unique, attenuation, and, spectrum, of, uv, rays, near, the, dead, sea, contribute, to, effective, photoclimatherapy, for, psoriasis, in, part, because, the, reduced, exposure, to, solar, radiation, allows, for, longer, periods, of, sunbathing, rhinosinusitis, patients, receiving, dead, sea, saline, nasal, irrigation, exhibited, improved, symptom, relief, compared, to, standard, hypertonic, saline, spray, in, one, study, dead, sea, mud, pack, therapy, has, been, suggested, to, temporarily, relieve, pain, in, patients, with, osteoarthritis, of, the, knees, according, to, researchers, of, the, ben, gurion, university, of, the, negev, treatment, with, mineral, rich, mud, compresses, can, be, used, to, augment, conventional, medical, therapy, the, sea, is, called, dead, because, its, high, salinity, prevents, macroscopic, aquatic, organisms, such, as, fish, and, aquatic, plants, from, living, in, it, though, minuscule, quantities, of, bacteria, and, microbial, fungi, are, present, in, times, of, flood, the, salt, content, of, the, dead, sea, can, drop, from, its, usual, 35, to, 30, or, lower, it, temporarily, comes, to, life, in, the, wake, of, rainy, winters, in, 1980, after, one, such, rainy, winter, the, normally, dark, blue, dead, sea, turned, red, researchers, from, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, found, it, to, be, teeming, with, an, alga, called, dunaliella, dunaliella, in, turn, nourished, carotenoid, containing, red, pigmented, halobacteria, whose, presence, caused, the, color, change, since, 1980, the, basin, has, been, dry, and, the, algae, and, the, bacteria, have, not, returned, in, measurable, numbers, in, 2011, a, group, of, scientists, from, be, er, sheva, israel, and, germany, discovered, fissures, in, the, floor, of, the, dead, sea, by, scuba, diving, and, observing, the, surface, these, fissures, allow, fresh, and, brackish, water, to, enter, they, sampled, biofilms, surrounding, the, fissures, and, discovered, numerous, species, of, bacteria, and, archaea, there, are, several, small, communities, near, the, dead, sea, these, include, ein, gedi, neve, zohar, and, the, israeli, settlements, in, the, megilot, regional, council, kalya, mitzpe, shalem, and, avnat, there, is, a, nature, preserve, at, ein, gedi, and, several, dead, sea, hotels, are, located, on, the, southwest, end, at, ein, bokek, near, neve, zohar, highway, 90, runs, north, south, on, the, israeli, side, for, a, total, distance, of, 565, km, 351, mi, from, metula, on, the, lebanese, border, in, the, north, to, its, southern, terminus, at, the, egyptian, border, near, the, red, sea, port, of, eilat, potash, city, is, a, small, community, on, the, jordanian, side, of, the, dead, sea, and, others, including, suweima, highway, 65, runs, north, south, on, the, jordanian, side, from, near, jordan, s, northern, tip, down, past, the, dead, sea, to, the, port, of, aqaba, dwelling, in, caves, near, the, dead, sea, is, recorded, in, the, hebrew, bible, as, having, taken, place, before, the, israelites, came, to, canaan, and, extensively, at, the, time, of, king, david, just, northwest, of, the, dead, sea, is, jericho, somewhere, perhaps, on, the, southeastern, shore, would, be, the, cities, mentioned, in, the, book, of, genesis, which, were, said, to, have, been, destroyed, in, the, time, of, abraham, sodom, and, gomorrah, genesis, 18, and, the, three, other, cities, of, the, plain, admah, zeboim, and, zoar, deuteronomy, 29, 23, zoar, escaped, destruction, when, abraham, s, nephew, lot, escaped, to, zoar, from, sodom, genesis, 19, 21, 22, before, the, destruction, the, dead, sea, was, a, valley, full, of, natural, tar, pits, which, was, called, the, vale, of, siddim, king, david, was, said, to, have, hidden, from, saul, at, ein, gedi, nearby, in, ezekiel, 47, 8, 9, there, is, a, specific, prophecy, that, the, sea, will, be, healed, and, made, fresh, becoming, a, normal, lake, capable, of, supporting, marine, life, a, similar, prophecy, is, stated, in, zechariah, 14, 8, which, says, that, living, waters, will, go, out, from, jerusalem, half, of, them, to, the, eastern, sea, and, half, to, the, western, sea, greek, and, jewish, writers, report, that, the, nabateans, had, monopolistic, control, over, the, dead, sea, archaeological, evidence, shows, multiple, anchorages, existing, on, both, sides, of, the, sea, including, in, ein, gedi, khirbet, mazin, where, the, ruins, of, a, hasmonean, era, dry, dock, are, located, numeira, and, near, masada, king, herod, the, great, built, or, rebuilt, several, fortresses, and, palaces, on, the, western, bank, of, the, dead, sea, the, most, famous, was, masada, where, in, 70, ce, a, small, group, of, jewish, zealots, fled, after, the, fall, of, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, the, zealots, survived, until, 73, ce, when, a, siege, by, the, x, legion, ended, in, the, deaths, by, suicide, of, its, 960, inhabitants, another, historically, important, fortress, was, machaerus, on, the, eastern, bank, where, according, to, josephus, john, the, baptist, was, imprisoned, by, herod, antipas, and, died, again, if, as, is, fabled, there, is, a, lake, in, palestine, such, that, if, you, bind, a, man, or, beast, and, throw, it, in, it, floats, and, does, not, sink, this, would, bear, out, what, we, have, said, they, say, that, this, lake, is, so, bitter, and, salty, that, no, fish, live, in, it, and, that, if, you, soak, clothes, in, it, and, shake, them, it, cleans, them, aristotle, meteorology, also, in, roman, times, some, essenes, settled, on, the, dead, sea, s, western, shore, pliny, the, elder, identifies, their, location, with, the, words, on, the, west, side, of, the, dead, sea, away, from, the, coast, the, town, of, engeda, natural, history, bk, 5, 73, and, it, is, therefore, a, hugely, popular, but, contested, hypothesis, today, that, same, essenes, are, identical, with, the, settlers, at, qumran, and, that, the, dead, sea, scrolls, discovered, during, the, 20th, century, in, the, nearby, caves, had, been, their, own, library, josephus, identified, the, dead, sea, in, geographic, proximity, to, the, ancient, biblical, city, of, sodom, however, he, referred, to, the,

have, been, unable, to, obtain, construction, permits, for, tourism, related, investments, on, the, dead, sea, according, to, the, world, bank, officials, in, the, palestinian, ministry, of, tourism, and, antiquities, state, that, the, only, way, to, apply, for, such, permits, is, through, the, joint, committees, established, under, the, oslo, agreement, but, the, relevant, committee, has, not, met, with, any, degree, of, regularity, since, 2000, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, the, dead, sea, began, to, attract, interest, from, chemists, who, deduced, the, sea, was, a, natural, deposit, of, potash, potassium, chloride, and, bromine, a, concession, was, granted, by, the, british, mandatory, government, to, the, newly, formed, palestine, potash, company, in, 1929,

dead, sea, has, been, rapidly, shrinking, since, the, 1960s, because, of, diversion, of, incoming, water, from, the, jordan, river, to, the, north, as, part, of, the, national, water, carrier, scheme, completed, in, 1964, the, southern, end, is, fed, by, a, canal, maintained, by, the, dead, sea, works, a, company, that, converts, the, sea, s, raw, materials, from, a, water, surface, of, 395, m, 1, 296, ft, below, sea, level, in, 1970, it, fell, 22, to, 418, m, 72, to, 1, 371, ft, below, sea, level, in, 2006, reaching, a, drop, rate, of, 1, m, 3, ft, per, year, as, the, water, level, decreases, the, characteristics, of, the, sea, and, surrounding, region, may, substantially, change, as, of, 2021, the, surface, of, the, sea, has, shrunk, by, about, 33, percent, since, the, 1960s, which, is, partly, attributed, to, the, much, reduced, flow, of, the, jordan, river, since, the, construction, of, the, national, water, carrier, project, and, the, amount, of, water, from, the, rains, reaching, the, dead, sea, has, diminished, even, further, since, flash, floods, started, pouring, into, the, sinkholes, left, by, its, shrinkage, the, ecopeace, middle, east, a, joint, israeli, palestinian, jordanian, environmental, group, has, estimated, that, the, annual, flow, into, the, dead, sea, from, the, jordan, is, as, of, 2021, less, than, 100, 000, 000, cubic, metres, 3, 5, 10, 9, cu, ft, of, water, compared, with, former, flows, of, between, 1, 200, 000, 000, cubic, metres, 4, 2, 10, 10, cu, ft, and, 1, 300, 000, 000, cubic, metres, 4, 6, 10, 10, cu, ft, sources, israel, oceanographic,

underground, layers, near, the, shoreline, to, be, flushed, out, by, freshwater, this, is, believed, to, be, the, cause, of, the, recent, appearance, of, large, sinkholes, along, the, western, shore, incoming, freshwater, dissolves, salt, layers, rapidly, creating, subsurface, cavities, that, subsequently, collapse, to, form, these, sinkholes, as, of, 2021, ein, gedi, on, the, western, coast, has, been, subject, to, a, large, number, of, sinkholes, appearing, in, the, area, attributed, to, the, decline, in, the, water, level, of, the, dead, sea, as, a, result, of, the, sinkholes, most, beach,

expressed, concern, about, the, declining, water, levels, some, suggested, industrial, activities, around, the, dead, sea, might, need, to, be, reduced, others, advised, environmental, measures, to,

incorporated, into, the, area, and, pollution, sources, should, be, reduced, in, october, 2009, the, jordanians, accelerated, plans, to, extract, around, 300, million, cubic, metres, 11, billion, cubic, feet, of, water, per, year, from, the, red, sea, desalinate, it, for, use, as, fresh, water, and, send, the, waste, water, to, the, dead, sea, by, tunnel, despite, concerns, about, inadequate, time, to, assess, the, potential, environmental, impact, according, to, jordan, s, minister, for, water, general, maysoun, zu, bi, this, project, could, be, considered, as, the, first, phase, of, the, red, sea, dead, sea, water, conveyance, in, december, 2013, israel, jordan, and, the, palestinian, authority, signed, an, agreement, for, laying, a, water, pipeline, to, link, the, red, sea, with, the, dead, sea, the, pipeline, would, be, 180, km, 110, mi, long, and, is, estimated, to, take, up, to, five, years, to, complete, in, january, 2015, it, was, reported, that, the, level, of, water, was, dropping, by, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, a, year, on, 27, november, 2016, the, jordanian, government, shortlisted, five, consortia, to, implement, the, project, jordan, s, ministry, of, water, and, irrigation, said, that, the, 100, million, first, phase, of, the, project, would, begin, construction, in, the, first, quarter, of, 2018, and, would, be, completed, by, 2021, the, project, was,
