the, lack, of, participation, of, women, in, politics, is, due, to, the, idea, that, politics, is, associated, with, men, and, that, women, should, avoid, this, sector, education, is, also, an, area, in, which, boys, dominate, since, it, is, a, better, investment, for, the, parents, as, traditional, values, and, practices, have, contributed, to, gender, inequality, in, mali, conflict, and,

improve, the, lives, of, the, people, mainly, women, and, girls, rights, in, order, to, re, engage, the, development, of, the, country, religion, the, patriarchal, norms, and, gender, based, violence, are, major, negative, factors, shaping, the, life, of, women, in, mali, patriarchal, norms, cause, major, gender, inequalities, and, lead, to, male, domination, within, the, household, girls, learn, household, activities, like, chores, cooking, childcare, etc, at, a, young, age, and, are, expected, to, take, the, main, responsibility, of, household, chores, throughout, their, life, this, hampers, women, s, ability, to, enter, the, formal, workforce, and, leads, to, a, lack, of, education, of, girls, gender, based, violence, in, mali, happens, both, on, a, national, and, a, family, level, at, the, national, level, in, 2012, the, conflict, in, the, northern, part, of, the, country, increased, cases, of, kidnappings, and, rapes, the, conflict, also, reduced, women, s, access, to, resources, economy, and, opportunities, at, the, household, level, malian, women, face, gender, based, violence, through, domestic, violence, forced, marriages, and, marital, rape, the, demographic, health, survey, for, mali, in, 2013, stated, that, 76, of, women, and, 54, of, men, believed, physical, harm, towards, women, was, acceptable, if, the, women, burnt, food, argued, back, went, out, without, notifying, her, husband, or, refused, sexual, relations, with, her, husband, the, lack, of, education, has, increased, gender, inequality, in, mali, because, not, many, women, are, working, outside, the, household, are, even, participating, in, the, public, administration, sector, after, adjusting, the, entrance, requirements, and, access, to, education, girls, still, have, lower, enrollment, rates, and, less, access, to, formal, education, drop, out, rates, for, girls, are, 15, higher, than, that, of, boys, because, they, have, a, higher, responsibility, at, home, and, most, parents, refuse, to, allow, all, their, children, to, go, to, school, so, boys, tend, to, become, educated, similarly, technical, and, vocational, education, has, a, lower, numbers, of, girls, participating, and, are, inadequately, distributed, in, the, country, because, the, training, centers, are, focused, in, the, urban, cities, finally, higher, education, for, girls, consist, of, short, programs, because, early, marriages, prevent, most, girls, from, pursuing, a, longer, term, education, program, like, those, in, science, although, women, do, not, have, the, same, access, of, education, in,
