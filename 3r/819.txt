lusaka, l, u, s, k, loo, sah, k, is, the, capital, and, largest, city, of, zambia, it, is, one, of, the, fastest, developing, cities, in, southern, africa, lusaka, is, in, the, southern, part, of, the, central, plateau, at, an, elevation, of, about, 1, 279, metres, 4, 196, ft, as, of, 2019, the, city, s, population, was, about, 3, 3, million, while, the, urban, population, is, estimated, at, 2, 5, million, in, 2018, lusaka, is, the, centre, of, both, commerce, and, government, in, zambia, and, connects, to, the, country, s, four, main, highways, heading, north, south, east, and, west, english, is, the, official, language, of, the, city, administration, while, bemba, and, nyanja, are, the, commonly, spoken, street, languages, the, earliest, evidence, of, settlement, in, the, area, dates, to, the, 6th, century, ad, with, the, first, known, settlement, in, the, 11th, century, it, was, then, home, to, the, lenje, and, soli, peoples, from, the, 17th, or, 18th, century, the, founding, of, the, modern, city, occurred, in, 1905, when, it, lay, in, the, british, protectorate, of, northern, rhodesia, which, was, controlled, by, the, british, south, african, company, bsac, the, bsac, built, a, railway, linking, their, mines, in, the, copperbelt, to, cape, town, and, lusaka, was, designated, as, a, water, stop, on, that, line, named, after, a, local, lenje, chief, called, lusaaka, white, afrikaner, farmers, then, settled, in, the, area, and, expanded, lusaka, into, a, regional, trading, centre, taking, over, its, administration, in, 1929, five, years, after, taking, over, control, of, northern, rhodesia, from, the, bsac, the, british, colonial, administration, decided, to, move, its, capital, from, livingstone, to, a, more, central, location, and, lusaka, was, chosen, town, planners, including, stanley, adshead, worked, on, the, project, and, the, city, was, built, out, over, the, subsequent, decades, lusaka, lost, some, of, its, status, to, salisbury, now, harare, in, zimbabwe, when, the, latter, became, the, capital, of, the, merged, federation, of, rhodesia, and, nyasaland, in, 1953, but, regained, it, when, it, was, named, the, capital, of, newly, independent, zambia, in, 1964, a, large, scale, building, programme, in, the, city, followed, including, government, buildings, the, university, of, zambia, and, a, new, airport, wealthy, suburbs, in, lusaka, include, woodlands, ibex, hill, and, rhodes, park, large, scale, migration, of, people, from, other, areas, of, zambia, occurred, both, before, and, after, independence, and, a, lack, of, sufficient, formal, housing, led, to, the, emergence, of, numerous, unplanned, shanty, towns, on, the, city, s, western, and, southern, fringes, the, earliest, evidence, of, settlement, in, the, area, around, what, is, now, the, lusaka, area, dates, to, the, 6th, century, the, first, known, village, dates, to, around, the, 11th, century, a, settlement, of, round, huts, close, to, the, modern, suburb, of, olympia, the, subsequent, centuries, saw, considerable, fluctuation, of, people, in, the, area, until, the, arrival, of, the, lenje, and, soli, peoples, in, the, 17th, or, 18th, century, the, soli, are, believed, by, scholars, to, have, arrived, as, part, of, the, luba, migration, along, the, luapula, river, while, the, lenje, are, related, to, the, ila, tonga, modern, lusaka, lies, on, the, boundary, of, the, territories, of, the, two, groups, with, the, lenje, inhabiting, the, region, to, the, north, of, the, city, and, the, soli, to, the, south, in, the, 19th, century, african, and, european, slave, traders, began, arriving, from, the, coastal, regions, of, modern, day, tanzania, mozambique, and, angola, enslaving, members, of, the, soli, and, lenje, communities, for, shipment, to, the, middle, east, europe, and, south, america, the, need, to, evade, these, attacks, as, well, as, their, use, of, a, shifting, cultivation, farming, system, necessitated, frequent, relocation, amongst, the, soli, and, lenje, and, there, were, therefore, no, major, permanent, settlements, in, the, late, 19th, century, british, south, african, mining, entrepreneur, and, politician, cecil, rhodes, founded, the, british, south, african, company, bsac, with, a, charter, from, queen, victoria, to, colonise, and, develop, land, in, sections, of, what, is, now, northern, south, africa, zimbabwe, zambia, malawi, and, botswana, rhodes, was, a, strong, believer, in, the, cape, to, cairo, railway, project, although, with, german, east, africa, blocking, the, route, to, the, north, of, bsac, territory, he, could, not, progress, it, during, his, lifetime, with, little, regard, for, the, prior, rights, of, the, african, populations, rhodes, directed, the, expansion, of, territorial, control, as, far, as, salisbury, now, harare, in, zimbabwe, and, his, company, continued, extending, to, the, north, even, after, his, death, in, 1902, the, bsac, took, formal, control, of, the, region, around, lusaka, through, the, protectorate, of, barotziland, north, western, rhodesia, named, after, rhodes, in, 1899, the, capital, was, initially, at, kalomo, being, switched, to, livingstone, in, 1907, this, was, merged, in, 1911, with, the, territory, of, north, eastern, rhodesia, to, form, northern, rhodesia, predecessor, of, modern, zambia, faced, with, uprisings, by, africans, within, their, territory, as, well, as, an, economic, decline, and, a, desire, to, expand, mining, interests, in, northern, zambia, s, copperbelt, the, bsac, expedited, the, building, of, the, northbound, railway, from, south, africa, into, northern, rhodesia, from, 1896, lusaka, was, founded, in, 1905, as, a, water, stop, on, the, route, and, was, named, after, a, chief, lusaaka, the, leader, of, a, nearby, lenje, village, the, section, of, line, through, lusaka, was, built, by, the, mashonaland, railway, company, extending, the, line, by, 452, kilometres, 281, mi, from, kalomo, through, to, the, mining, town, of, broken, hill, now, kabwe, during, the, subsequent, years, white, afrikaner, farmers, settled, in, the, area, lusaka, becoming, their, regional, centre, and, access, point, to, the, railway, by, 1913, several, stores, and, a, hotel, had, opened, and, they, persuaded, the, bsac, to, declare, lusaka, as, a, recognised, town, and, cede, control, of, local, affairs, to, them, this, early, town, was, governed, by, the, lusaka, village, management, board, elected, by, the, farmers, and, consisted, of, a, tract, of, land, along, the, railway, route, 5, kilometres, 3, mi, in, length, and, 1, 5, kilometres, 0, 9, mi, wide, after, world, war, i, the, united, kingdom, took, control, of, tanganyika, now, tanzania, which, had, been, previously, part, of, german, east, africa, this, created, an, almost, continuous, line, of, british, colonies, from, south, africa, through, to, egypt, and, led, to, the, revival, of, projects, for, the, cape, to, cairo, railway, and, a, similar, road, route, the, british, imperial, government, took, direct, control, of, northern, rhodesia, in, 1924, through, a, governor, and, legislative, council, but, the, bsac, retained, its, rights, over, mining, acquired, in, prior, decades, the, new, administration, favoured, an, indirect, rule, system, with, self, governance, for, the, african, population, although, in, reality, the, rights, of, africans, remained, very, limited, the, mining, corporations, as, well, as, afrikaner, farmers, around, lusaka, did, not, welcome, the, change, favouring, a, south, african, model, the, colonial, administration, favoured, the, establishment, of, planned, towns, as, a, means, of, asserting, its, authority, in, march, 1929, the, uk, s, colonial, office, sent, a, telegram, to, the, northern, rhodesian, government, recommending, that, the, capital, of, the, territory, be, moved, citing, communications, and, also, health, reasons, however, the, medical, rationale, for, the, relocation, was, not, explicitly, published, at, the, time, james, maxwell, a, former, physician, and, the, protectorate, s, governor, since, 1927, brought, his, former, colleague, david, alexander, from, nigeria, to, assist, him, with, this, relocation, project, keen, to, avoid, the, informal, development, of, the, townships, that, were, emerging, close, to, mining, areas, alexander, recommended, that, a, town, planner, be, recruited, to, design, the, capital, maxwell, and, alexander, then, investigated, possible, sites, for, the, new, city, eventually, choosing, lusaka, as, a, result, of, its, situation, on, the, railway, and, at, the, crossroads, of, northern, rhodesia, s, great, north, road, and, great, east, road, maxwell, requested, a, town, planner, from, the, colonial, office, which, sent, university, college, london, professor, stanley, adshead, as, well, as, a, water, engineer, to, the, colony, adshead, examined, several, possible, locations, for, the, capital, eventually, confirming, lusaka, as, a, suitable, location, in, late, 1930, he, had, considered, placing, the, capital, in, the, copperbelt, but, a, mutual, distrust, between, the, mining, corporations, and, the, government, meant, that, both, preferred, to, maintain, some, distance, between, the, capital, and, the, mines, the, water, engineer, s, investigations, concluded, that, there, was, sufficient, groundwater, and, the, report, confirming, lusaka, as, the, planned, capital, was, approved, by, the, legislative, council, in, july, 1931, ronald, storrs, replaced, maxwell, as, governor, in, 1932, but, funds, were, limited, as, a, result, of, the, great, depression, and, there, was, little, progress, on, the, development, of, lusaka, several, thousand, africans, migrated, to, the, city, in, search, of, construction, work, but, none, was, available, leading, to, large, scale, poverty, hunger, and, rioting, storrs, s, greatest, interest, in, the, project, was, the, development, of, the, government, house, echoing, a, similar, project, he, had, initiated, as, governor, of, cyprus, when, his, headquarters, was, burned, down, in, a, revolt, seeking, to, emulate, the, cyprus, building, as, well, as, the, recently, completed, viceroy, s, mansion, in, new, delhi, storrs, commissioned, several, top, architects, to, work, on, the, plan, which, was, presented, at, the, royal, academy, the, 43, 000, projected, cost, of, the, building, was, more, than, 10, per, cent, of, the, total, budget, earmarked, for, the, lusaka, project, and, the, colonial, office, insisted, in, late, 1933, that, it, be, reduced, storrs, left, his, post, as, governor, shortly, afterwards, on, the, grounds, of, ill, health, by, that, point, the, completed, work, consisted, of, a, few, short, stretches, of, road, including, cairo, road, named, for, its, anticipated, place, on, the, proposed, cape, to, cairo, road, and, some, houses, and, flats, for, government, officials, storrs, s, replacement, as, governor, was, hubert, winthrop, young, who, had, been, serving, as, governor, of, neighbouring, nyasaland, now, malawi, early, in, his, tenure, in, april, 1934, young, hosted, a, visit, to, lusaka, by, prince, george, the, fourth, son, of, king, george, v, during, his, visit, george, laid, the, foundation, stone, of, lusaka, s, administrative, buildings, as, well, as, opening, roads, named, after, his, father, and, himself, after, the, royal, visit, young, wrote, to, the, colonial, office, that, he, was, optimistic, about, the, future, of, lusaka, and, he, appointed, administrator, eric, dutton, to, lead, the, project, there, was, some, resistance, from, the, white, population, of, livingstone, which, feared, that, the, capital, would, lead, to, a, loss, of, business, young, refused, their, demand, to, compensate, them, financially, but, he, sought, to, placate, them, by, establishing, livingstone, as, the, protectorate, s, tourism, capital, with, a, new, museum, and, a, game, reserve, lusaka, formally, became, the, capital, in, may, 1935, with, a, lusaka, week, celebration, scheduled, to, coincide, with, celebrations, of, george, v, s, silver, jubilee, the, government, commissioned, a, special, train, which, moved, all, government, officials, from, livingstone, to, lusaka, during, a, single, weekend, under, adshead, s, original, plans, lusaka, was, proposed, as, a, pure, administrative, centre, with, no, industry, or, large, african, population, he, commented, at, one, point, that, it, could, never, become, an, important, city, under, bowling, s, revised, plans, there, were, areas, designated, for, both, light, and, heavy, industry, as, well, as, a, business, area, he, gave, prominence, to, the, airport, as, well, as, to, the, government, house, albeit, under, a, simpler, design, than, that, envisaged, by, storrs, both, men, had, built, racial, segregation, into, their, plans, dividing, the, city, into, native, and, non, native, areas, with, residential, areas, and, services, for, africans, placed, on, the, southern, periphery, of, the, city, despite, producing, these, plans, both, adshead, and, bowling, had, left, rhodesia, before, the, lusaka, week, and, the, remainder, of, the, building, was, left, to, dutton, and, a, small, team, of, white, officials, the, city, s, footprint, covered, a, large, area, even, at, this, early, stage, despite, much, of, it, being, undeveloped, this, was, part, of, a, policy, devised, by, adshead, intended, to, allow, internal, expansion, rather, than, the, usual, central, core, with, suburbs, added, outside, the, building, of, lusaka, continued, through, the, second, half, of, the, 1930s, but, progress, was, slowed, by, a, shortage, of, funds, the, northern, rhodesia, government, had, hoped, to, raise, money, through, taxes, on, the, mining, companies, but, these, were, mostly, registered, in, the, united, kingdom, and, paid, all, the, tax, on, their, revenues, there, the, loan, taken, to, cover, the, project, s, 400, 000, budget, was, guaranteed, by, the, beit, trust, but, there, was, no, scope, for, additional, infrastructure, to, be, built, the, uk, launched, an, investigation, into, a, possible, merger, of, southern, rhodesia, northern, rhodesia, and, nyasaland, in, 1938, a, prospect, which, caused, private, businesses, to, withdraw, investment, fearing, that, lusaka, would, lose, its, capital, status, this, left, the, government, as, the, sole, source, of, funds, also, in, 1938, the, northern, rhodesia, government, commissioned, a, report, by, finance, expert, alan, pim, to, examine, the, territory, s, economy, this, concluded, that, despite, the, relatively, high, taxes, on, mining, in, the, territory, the, administration, which, was, already, heavily, reliant, on, revenue, from, mining, was, not, getting, its, fair, share, pim, also, criticised, the, allocation, of, housing, for, africans, in, lusaka, noting, that, of, 10, 000, living, in, the, city, at, that, time, only, 1, 500, were, in, formal, housing, africans, were, at, that, time, only, permitted, to, live, in, the, city, under, temporary, work, permits, with, family, members, required, to, remain, elsewhere, the, need, for, metals, during, world, war, ii, led, to, a, boom, in, the, copper, industry, which, accompanied, by, a, 1941, excess, profits, tax, ordered, by, the, uk, brought, increased, revenue, to, the, government, the, boom, also, led, to, a, substantial, increase, in, urbanisation, lusaka, s, official, population, which, excluded, much, of, the, african, population, rose, from, around, 2, 000, in, 1931, to, almost, 19, 000, in, 1946, with, a, 15, per, cent, annual, growth, rate, in, 1948, the, government, passed, the, african, housing, ordinance, which, authorised, permanent, residential, suburbs, for, africans, including, married, couples, employers, in, the, city, were, also, required, to, pay, for, their, workers, housing, the, city, authorities, founded, the, african, housing, board, which, built, the, new, suburbs, of, new, chilenje, and, matero, lusaka, s, african, workforce, which, remained, relatively, unskilled, did, not, benefit, as, much, as, that, of, the, copperbelt, where, a, shortage, of, skilled, mining, labour, had, led, to, improved, pay, in, 1952, a, development, plan, for, lusaka, gained, statutory, approval, for, the, first, time, earlier, proposals, such, as, those, by, adshead, and, bowling, had, never, been, legally, sanctioned, this, plan, envisaged, much, more, territory, for, the, african, suburbs, but, only, around, one, third, of, these, were, ever, built, in, 1953, the, british, government, approved, the, pre, war, plan, to, merge, northern, rhodesia, with, its, two, neighbours, forming, the, federation, of, rhodesia, and, nyasaland, authorities, in, london, cited, the, economic, benefits, and, the, belief, that, the, merged, territory, would, form, a, multiracial, state, to, counter, the, rise, of, apartheid, in, south, africa, the, federation, was, popular, with, white, settlers, across, the, region, especially, in, southern, rhodesia, but, was, strongly, opposed, by, the, african, population, lusaka, remained, the, capital, of, northern, rhodesia, but, many, of, the, government, departments, as, well, as, some, private, sector, industries, moved, to, salisbury, which, was, designated, as, the, federal, capital, lusaka, s, economy, suffered, as, a, result, with, reduced, jobs, in, construction, transportation, and, domestic, service, this, economic, decline, coupled, with, a, fall, in, copper, prices, in, the, mid, to, late, 1950s, resulted, in, large, scale, unemployment, among, both, african, and, white, lusakans, the, population, continued, to, grow, however, as, increasing, numbers, moved, from, rural, areas, to, the, city, s, informal, settlements, in, contrast, to, south, africa, where, the, government, regularly, bulldozed, them, the, authorities, in, rhodesia, tolerated, these, squatter, areas, although, they, provided, no, services, and, africans, continued, to, live, under, strict, legal, constraints, as, discontent, with, federation, rose, a, new, group, of, african, leaders, emerged, in, the, late, 1950s, seeking, majority, rule, and, independence, for, northern, rhodesia, as, had, recently, been, attained, in, ghana, after, a, civil, disobedience, in, 1962, led, by, kenneth, kaunda, s, united, national, independence, party, unip, the, uk, government, agreed, to, a, new, constitution, under, which, africans, took, control, of, the, legislature, the, end, of, the, federation, followed, in, 1963, and, in, 1964, northern, rhodesia, became, independent, as, the, republic, of, zambia, lusaka, was, named, as, the, capital, of, zambia, a, large, scale, building, programme, in, the, city, followed, including, government, buildings, the, university, of, zambia, and, a, new, airport, the, employment, opportunities, that, arose, from, this, attracted, further, migration, from, rural, areas, into, lusaka, exacerbating, the, city, s, housing, shortage, the, government, constructed, several, new, housing, estates, during, the, 1960s, including, new, kamwala, and, chilenje, south, this, was, the, first, time, that, good, quality, housing, with, public, utilities, had, been, built, for, the, african, population, although, it, was, largely, limited, to, civil, servants, and, copper, industry, workers, with, the, majority, of, residents, continuing, to, live, in, the, informal, settlements, although, zambia, malawi, and, tanzania, had, achieved, independence, by, the, mid, 1960s, the, other, nearby, territories, of, mozambique, angola, southern, rhodesia, and, south, africa, were, still, under, white, minority, control, many, activists, from, these, territories, moved, to, post, independence, lusaka, and, american, historian, evan, wade, later, described, it, as, the, center, of, anti, colonial, resistance, for, southern, africa, in, 1969, the, city, hosted, the, fifth, summit, conference, of, east, and, central, african, states, attended, by, fourteen, leaders, of, african, countries, the, conference, produced, the, lusaka, manifesto, a, pledge, of, solidarity, by, the, signatories, in, seeking, majority, rule, in, southern, africa, the, manifesto, advocated, a, strategy, of, negotiation, rather, than, violence, and, was, later, endorsed, by, the, united, nations, the, 1965, unilateral, declaration, of, independence, in, southern, rhodesia, and, subsequent, un, embargo, and, eventual, border, closure, impacted, zambia, s, economy, depriving, it, of, its, principal, trade, route, in, the, early, days, of, independence, with, high, revenues, from, copper, exports, economists, described, zambia, as, a, middle, income, country, with, the, potential, to, become, fully, developed, beginning, in, the, 1970s, however, the, zambian, economy, suffered, a, major, decline, as, a, result, of, falling, copper, prices, and, rising, oil, prices, per, capita, income, dropped, by, 50, between, 1974, and, 1994, the, slow, down, also, highlighted, what, american, political, scientist, john, harbeson, described, as, a, massive, and, inefficient, parastatal, sector, as, well, as, the, government, s, prevailing, urban, bias, and, led, to, a, fall, in, formal, employment, in, lusaka, which, continued, for, several, decades, the, lack, of, jobs, decreased, the, level, of, rural, to, urban, migration, in, zambia, but, the, decline, of, the, copper, industry, caused, a, large, movement, of, people, from, the, copperbelt, cities, to, lusaka, this, and, the, natural, population, growth, in, the, city, s, young, population, gave, lusaka, a, population, growth, of, around, 4, in, the, 1990s, exceeding, the, national, average, the, zambian, economy, grew, rapidly, during, the, 2000s, and, the, government, initiated, projects, designed, to, improve, the, quality, of, housing, and, access, to, services, in, lusaka, these, included, a, comprehensive, urban, development, plan, prepared, by, the, zambian, government, and, the, japan, international, cooperation, agency, jica, and, an, urban, and, regional, planning, bill, which, was, enacted, in, 2015, inequality, and, underinvestment, in, housing, remain, high, however, with, 70, of, residents, still, living, in, unplanned, settlements, in, 2015, in, 2018, the, city, council, began, a, programme, of, road, improvements, to, tackle, chronic, traffic, congestion, but, the, lack, of, quality, housing, and, services, remains, an, issue, as, of, 2021, the, zambian, terrain, consists, mainly, of, a, high, altitude, plateau, with, some, hills, and, mountains, lusaka, is, located, on, the, plateau, in, south, central, zambia, at, 15, 25, s, 28, 17, e, with, an, altitude, of, 1, 280, metres, 4, 200, ft, it, is, located, 472, kilometres, 293, mi,
