travellers, or, organisations, since, previous, census, data, usually, covered, wider, areas, such, as, the, jerusalem, district, these, estimates, suggest, that, since, the, end, of, the, crusades, muslims, formed, the, largest, group, in, jerusalem, until, the, mid, nineteenth, century, between, 1838, and, 1876, a, number, of, estimates, exist, which, conflict, as, to, whether, jews, or,

arab, population, is, 42, in, 1967, jews, accounted, for, 74, percent, of, the, population, while, the, figure, for, 2006, is, down, nine, percent, possible, factors, are, the, high, cost, of, housing, fewer, job, opportunities, and, the, increasingly, religious, character, of, the, city, although, proportionally, young, haredim, are, leaving, in, higher, numbers, the, percentage, of,

mecca, the, qibla, direction, of, prayer, for, muslims, was, jerusalem, the, city, s, lasting, place, in, islam, however, is, primarily, due, to, muhammad, s, night, journey, c, 620, ce, muslims, believe, that, muhammad, was, miraculously, transported, one, night, from, the, great, mosque, of, mecca, to, the, temple, mount, in, jerusalem, whereupon, he, ascended, to, heaven, to, meet, previous, prophets, of, islam, the, first, verse, in, the, qur, an, s, surat, al, isra, notes, the, destination, of, muhammad, s, journey, as, al, masjid, al, aq, the, farthest, place, of, prayer, in, the, earliest, days, of, islam, this, was, understood, as, a, reference, to, a, site, in, the, heavens, however, post, rashidun, islamic, scholars, understood, it, as, relating, to, jerusalem, and,
