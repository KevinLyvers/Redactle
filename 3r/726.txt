incorporated, into, the, north, german, confederation, of, 1867, but, the, question, of, german, unity, was, still, alive, when, france, declared, war, on, prussia, in, 1870, all, the, south, german, states, baden, w, rttemberg, hessen, darmstadt, and, bavaria, aside, from, austria, joined, the, prussian, forces, and, ultimately, joined, the, federation, which, was, renamed, deutsches, reich, german, empire, in, 1871, bavaria, continued, as, a, monarchy, and, retained, some, special, rights, within, the, federation, such, as, railways, and, postal, services, and, control, of, its, army, in, peace, times, when, bavaria, became, part, of, the, newly, formed, german, empire, this, action, was, considered, controversial, by, bavarian, nationalists, who, had, wanted, to, retain, independence, from, the, rest, of, germany, as, had, austria, as, bavaria, had, a, heavily, catholic, majority, population, many, people, resented, being, ruled, by, the, mostly, protestant, northerners, in, prussia, as, a, direct, result, of, the, bavarian, prussian, feud, political, parties, formed, to, encourage, bavaria, to, break, away, and, regain, its, independence, in, the, early, 20th, century, wassily, kandinsky, paul, klee, henrik, ibsen, and, other, artists, were, drawn, to, bavaria, especially, to, the, schwabing, district, in, munich, a, center, of, international, artistic, activity, at, the, time, world, war, i, led, to, the, abolition, of, monarchy, all, over, germany, in, 1918, the, bavarian, monarchy, was, the, first, to, fall, when, on, 8, november, 1918, socialist, politician, kurt, eisner, proclaimed, the, free, state, i, e, republic, of, bavaria, eisner, headed, a, new, republican, government, as, minister, president, on, 12, november, king, ludwig, iii, signed, the, anif, declaration, releasing, both, civil, and, military, officers, from, their, oaths, which, the, eisner, government, interpreted, as, an, abdication, after, losing, the, january, 1919, elections, eisner, was, assassinated, in, february, 1919, ultimately, leading, to, a, communist, revolt, and, the, short, lived, bavarian, soviet, republic, being, proclaimed, 6, april, 1919, after, violent, suppression, by, elements, of, the, german, army, and, notably, the, freikorps, the, bavarian, soviet, republic, fell, in, may, 1919, the, bamberg, constitution, bamberger, verfassung, was, enacted, on, 12, or, 14, august, 1919, and, came, into, force, on, 15, september, 1919, placing, bavaria, inside, the, weimar, republic, extremist, activity, further, increased, notably, the, 1923, beer, hall, putsch, led, by, the, nazis, and, munich, and, nuremberg, became, seen, as, strongholds, of, nazism, during, the, weimar, republic, and, nazi, dictatorship, however, in, the, crucial, german, federal, election, march, 1933, the, nazis, received, less, than, 50, of, the, votes, cast, in, bavaria, as, a, manufacturing, centre, munich, was, heavily, bombed, during, world, war, ii, and, was, occupied, by, united, states, armed, forces, becoming, a, major, part, of, the, american, zone, of, allied, occupied, germany, which, lasted, from, 1945, to, 1947, and, then, of, bizone, the, rhenish, palatinate, was, detached, from, bavaria, in, 1946, and, made, part, of, the, new, state, rhineland, palatinate, in, 1949, bavaria, became, part, of, the, federal, republic, of, germany, despite, the, bavarian, parliament, voting, against, adopting, the, basic, law, of, germany, mainly, because, it, was, seen, as, not, granting, sufficient, powers, to, the, individual, states, l, nder, but, at, the, same, time, declared, that, it, would, accept, it, if, two, thirds, of, the, other, l, nder, ratified, it, all, of, the, other, states, ratified, it, so, it, became, law, thus, during, the, cold, war, bavaria, was, part, of, west, germany, bavarians, have, often, emphasized, a, separate, national, identity, and, considered, themselves, as, bavarians, first, germans, second, in, the, 19th, century, sense, an, independent, kingdom, of, bavaria, existed, from, only, 1806, to, 1871, a, separate, bavarian, identity, was, emphasized, more, strongly, when, bavaria, joined, the, prussia, dominated, german, empire, in, 1871, while, the, bavarian, nationalists, wanted, to, keep, bavaria, as, catholic, and, an, independent, state, aside, from, the, minority, bavaria, party, most, bavarians, now, accept, bavaria, as, part, of, germany, another, consideration, is, that, bavaria, is, not, culturally, uniform, while, inhabitants, altbayern, old, bavaria, the, regions, forming, the, historic, bavaria, before, further, acquisitions, in, 1806, 1815, speak, a, bavarian, dialect, of, german, franconia, in, the, north, and, bavarian, swabia, in, the, south, west, have, their, unique, culture, including, different, dialects, of, german, east, franconian, and, swabian, respectively, uniquely, among, german, states, bavaria, has, two, official, flags, of, equal, status, one, with, a, white, and, blue, stripe, the, other, with, white, and, blue, diamond, shaped, lozenges, either, may, be, used, by, civilians, and, government, offices, who, are, free, to, choose, between, them, unofficial, versions, of, the, flag, especially, a, lozenge, style, with, coat, of, arms, are, sometimes, used, by, civilians, the, modern, coat, of, arms, of, bavaria, was, designed, by, eduard, ege, in, 1946, following, heraldic, traditions, bavaria, shares, international, borders, with, austria, salzburg, tyrol, upper, austria, and, vorarlberg, and, the, czech, republic, karlovy, vary, plze, and, south, bohemian, regions, as, well, as, with, switzerland, across, lake, constance, to, the, canton, of, st, gallen, neighboring, states, within, germany,

the, vast, majority, of, the, frontier, with, the, czech, republic, and, bohemia, the, geographic, center, of, the, european, union, is, located, in, the, northwestern, corner, of, bavaria, at, lower, elevations, the, climate, is, classified, according, to, k, ppen, s, guide, as, cfb, or, dfb, at, higher, altitudes, the, climate, becomes, dfc, and, et, the, summer, months, have, been, getting, hotter, in, recent, years, for, example, june, 2019, was, the, warmest, june, in, bavaria, since, weather, observations, have, been, recorded, and, the, winter, 2019, 2020, was, 3, degrees, celsius, warmer, than, the, average, temperature, for, many, years, all, over, bavaria, on, 20, december, 2019, a, record, temperature, of, 20, 2, c, 68, 4, f, was, recorded, in, piding, in, general, winter, months, are, seeing, more, precipitation, which, is, taking, the, form, of, rain, more, often, than, that, of, snow, compared, to, the, past, extreme, weather, like, the, 2013, european, floods, or, the, 2019, european, heavy, snowfalls, is, occurring, more, and, more, often, one, effect, of, the, continuing, warming, is, the, melting, of, almost, all, bavarian, alpine, glaciers, of, the, five,
