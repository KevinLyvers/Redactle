institutions, and, community, commissions, remaining, is, only, the, governor, of, brussels, capital, and, some, aides, analogously, to, provinces, its, status, is, roughly, akin, to, that, of, a, federal, district, the, brussels, capital, region, is, governed, by, a, parliament, of, 89, members, 72, french, speaking, 17, dutch, speaking, parties, are, organised, on, a, linguistic, basis, and, an, eight, member, regional, cabinet, consisting, of, a, minister, president, four, ministers, and, three, state, secretaries, by, law, the, cabinet, must, comprise, two, french, speaking, and, two, dutch, speaking, ministers, one, dutch, speaking, secretary, of, state, and, two, french, speaking, secretaries, of, state, the, minister, president, does, not, count, against, the, language, quota, but, in, practice, every, minister, president, has, been, a, bilingual, francophone, the, regional, parliament, can, enact, ordinances, french, ordonnances, dutch, ordonnanties, which, have, equal, status, as, a, national, legislative, act, nineteen, of, the, 72, french, speaking, members, of, the, brussels, parliament, are, also, members, of, the, parliament, of, the, french, community, of, belgium, and, until, 2004, this, was, also, the, case, for, six, dutch, speaking, members, who, were, at, the, same, time, members, of, the, flemish, parliament, now, people, voting, for, a, flemish, party, have, to, vote, separately, for, 6, directly, elected, members, of, the, flemish, parliament, before, the, creation, of, the, brussels, capital, region, regional, competences, in, the, 19, municipalities, were, performed, by, the, brussels, agglomeration, the, brussels, agglomeration, was, an, administrative, division, established, in, 1971, this, decentralised, administrative, public, body, also, assumed, jurisdiction, over, areas, which, elsewhere, in, belgium, were, exercised, by, municipalities, or, provinces, the, brussels, agglomeration, had, a, separate, legislative, council, but, the, by, laws, enacted, by, it, did, not, have, the, status, of, a, legislative, act, the, only, election, of, the, council, took, place, on, 21, november, 1971, the, working, of, the, council, was, subject, to, many, difficulties, caused, by, the, linguistic, and, socio, economic, tensions, between, the, two, communities, after, the, creation, of, the, brussels, capital, region, the, brussels, agglomeration, was, never, formally, abolished, although, it, no, longer, has, a, purpose, the, french, community, and, the, flemish, community, exercise, their, powers, in, brussels, through, two, community, specific, public, authorities, the, french, community, commission, french, commission, communautaire, fran, aise, or, cocof, and, the, flemish, community, commission, dutch,

the, french, community, commission, for, the, bilingual, language, area, the, flemish, community, however, did, the, opposite, it, merged, the, flemish, region, into, the, flemish, community, this, is, related, to, different, conceptions, in, the, two, communities, one, focusing, more, on, the, communities, and, the, other, more, on, the, regions, causing, an, asymmetrical, federalism, because, of, this, devolution, the, french, community, commission, can, enact, decrees, which, are, legislative, acts, a, bi, communitarian, public, authority, the, common, community, commission, french,

also, enact, ordinances, which, have, equal, status, as, a, national, legislative, act, in, the, field, of, the, welfare, powers, of, the, communities, in, the, brussels, capital, region, both, the, french, community, and, the, flemish, community, can, exercise, powers, in, the, field, of, welfare, but, only, in, regard, to, institutions, that, are, unilingual, for, example, a, private, french,

were, naturalised, following, the, great, 1991, reform, of, the, naturalisation, process, in, 2012, about, 32, of, city, residents, were, of, non, belgian, european, origin, mainly, expatriates, from,

outside, the, eu, a, majority, of, the, permanent, residents, have, acquired, belgian, nationality, brussels, was, historically, dutch, speaking, using, the, brabantian, dialect, but, since, the, 19th, century, french, has, become, the, predominant, language, of, the, city, the, main, cause, of, this, transition, was, the, rapid, assimilation, of, the, local, flemish, population, amplified, by, immigration, from, france, and, wallonia, the, rise, of, french, in, public, life, gradually, began, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, quickly, accelerating, after, belgian, independence, dutch, of, which, standardisation, in, belgium, was, still, very, weak, could, not, compete, with, french, which, was, the, exclusive, language, of, the, judiciary, the, administration, the, army, education, cultural, life, and, the, media, and, thus, necessary, for, social, mobility, the, value, and, prestige, of, the, french, language, was, universally, acknowledged, to, such, an, extent, that, after, 1880, and, more, particularly, after, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, proficiency, in, french, among, dutch, speakers, in, brussels, increased, spectacularly, although, a, majority, of, the, population, remained, bilingual, until, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, family, transmission, of, the, historic, brabantian, dialect, declined, leading, to, an, increase, of, monolingual, french, speakers, from, 1910, onwards, from, the, mid, 20th, century, the, number, of, monolingual, french, speakers, surpassed, the, number, of, mostly, bilingual, flemish, inhabitants, this, process, of, assimilation, weakened, after, the, 1960s, as, the, language, border, was, fixed, the, status, of, dutch, as, an, official, language, of, belgium, was, reinforced, and, the, economic, centre, of, gravity, shifted, northward, to, flanders, however, with, the, continuing, arrival, of, immigrants, and, the, post, war, emergence, of, brussels, as, a, centre, of, international, politics, the, relative, position, of, dutch, continued, to, decline, furthermore, as, brussels, urban, area, expanded, a, further, number, of, dutch, speaking, municipalities, in, the, brussels, periphery, also, became, predominantly, french, speaking, this, phenomenon, of, expanding, francisation, dubbed, oil, slick, by, its, opponents, is, together, with, the, future, of, brussels, one, of, the, most, controversial, topics, in, belgian, politics, nowadays, the, brussels, capital, region, is, legally, bilingual, with, both, french, and, dutch, having, official, status, as, is, the, administration, of, the, 19, municipalities, the, creation, of, this, bilingual, full, fledged, region, with, its, own, competencies, and, jurisdiction, had, long, been, hampered, by, different, visions, of, belgian, federalism, nevertheless, some, communitarian, issues, remain, flemish, political, parties, demanded, for, decades, that, the, flemish, part, of, brussels, halle, vilvoorde, bhv, arrondissement, be, separated, from, the, brussels, region, which, made, halle, vilvoorde, a, monolingual, flemish, electoral, and, judicial, district, bhv, was, divided, mid, 2012, the, french, speaking, population, regards, the, language, border, as, artificial, and, demands, the, extension, of, the, bilingual, region, to, at, least, all, six, municipalities, with, language, facilities, in, the, surroundings, of, brussels, flemish, politicians, have, strongly, rejected, these, proposals, owing, to, migration, and, to, its, international, role, brussels, is, home, to, a, large, number, of, native, speakers, of, languages, other, than, french, or, dutch, currently, about, half, of, the, population, speaks, a, home, language, other, than, these, two, in, 2013, academic, research, showed, that, approximately, 17, of, families, spoke, none, of, the, official, languages, in, the, home, while, in, a, further, 23, a, foreign, language, was, used, alongside, french, the, share, of, unilingual, french, speaking, families, had, fallen, to, 38, and, that, of, dutch, speaking, families, to, 5, while, the, percentage, of, bilingual, dutch, french, families, reached, 17, at, the, same, time, french, remains, widely, spoken, in, 2013, french, was, spoken, well, to, perfectly, by, 88, of, the, population, while, for, dutch, this, percentage, was, only, 23, down, from, 33, in, 2000, the, other, most, commonly, known, languages, were, english, 30, arabic, 18, spanish, 9, german, 7, and, italian, and, turkish, 5, each, despite, the, rise, of, english, as, a, second, language, in, brussels, including, as, an, unofficial, compromise, language, between, french, and, dutch, as, well, as, the, working, language, for, some, of, its, international, businesses, and, institutions, french, remains, the, lingua, franca, and, all, public, services, are, conducted, exclusively, in, french, or, dutch, the, original, dialect, of, brussels, known, as, brusselian, and, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, marols, or, marollien, a, form, of, brabantic, the, variant, of, dutch, spoken, in, the, ancient, duchy, of, brabant, with, a, significant, number, of, loanwords, from, french, still, survives, among, a, small, minority, of, inhabitants, called, brusseleers, or, brusseleirs, many, of, them, quite, bi, and, multilingual, or, educated, in, french, and, not, writing, in, dutch, the, ethnic, and, national, self, identification, of, brussels, inhabitants, is, nonetheless, sometimes, quite, distinct, from, the, french, and, dutch, speaking, communities, for, the, french, speakers, it, can, vary, from, francophone, belgian, bruxellois, french, demonym, for, an, inhabitant, of, brussels, walloon, for, people, who, migrated, from, the, walloon, region, at, an, adult, age, for, flemings, living, in, brussels, it, is, mainly, either, dutch, speaking, belgian, flemish, or, brusselaar, dutch, demonym, for, an, inhabitant, and, often, both, for, the,
