mount, kilimanjaro, k, l, m, n, d, r, o, is, a, dormant, volcano, in, tanzania, with, three, volcanic, cones, kibo, mawenzi, and, shira, it, is, the, highest, mountain, in, africa, and, the, highest, single, free, standing, mountain, above, sea, level, in, the, world, 5, 895, m, 19, 341, ft, above, sea, level, and, 4, 900, m, 16, 100, ft, above, its, plateau, base, it, is, also, the, highest, volcano, in, the, eastern, hemisphere, kilimanjaro, is, the, fourth, most, topographically, prominent, peak, on, earth, it, is, part, of, kilimanjaro, national, park, and, is, a, major, hiking, and, climbing, destination, because, of, its, shrinking, glaciers, and, ice, fields, which, are, projected, to, disappear, between, 2025, and, 2035, it, has, been, the, subject, of, many, scientific, studies, the, origin, of, the, name, kilimanjaro, is, not, known, but, several, theories, exist, european, explorers, had, adopted, the, name, by, 1860, and, reported, that, kilimanjaro, was, the, mountain, s, kiswahili, name, the, 1907, edition, of, the, nuttall, encyclop, dia, also, records, the, name, of, the, mountain, as, kilima, njaro, johann, ludwig, krapf, wrote, in, 1860, that, swahilis, along, the, coast, called, the, mountain, kilimanjaro, although, he, did, not, offer, any, support, he, claimed, that, kilimanjaro, meant, either, mountain, of, greatness, or, mountain, of, caravans, under, the, latter, meaning, kilima, meant, mountain, and, jaro, meant, caravans, jim, thompson, claimed, in, 1885, again, without, support, that, the, term, kilima, njaro, has, generally, been, understood, to, mean, the, mountain, kilima, of, greatness, njaro, he, also, suggested, though, not, improbably, it, may, mean, the, white, mountain, njaro, is, an, ancient, kiswahili, word, for, shining, similarly, krapf, wrote, that, a, chief, of, the, wakamba, people, whom, he, visited, in, 1849, had, been, to, jagga, and, had, seen, the, kima, jajeu, mountain, of, whiteness, the, name, given, by, the, wakamba, to, kilimanjaro, more, correctly, in, the, kikamba, language, this, would, be, kiima, kyeu, and, this, possible, derivation, has, been, popular, with, several, investigators, others, have, assumed, that, kilima, is, swahili, for, mountain, the, problem, with, this, assumption, is, that, kilima, actually, means, hill, and, is, therefore, the, diminutive, of, mlima, the, proper, swahili, word, for, mountain, however, t, is, possible, that, an, early, european, visitor, whose, knowledge, of, was, not, extensive, changed, mlima, to, kilima, by, analogy, with, the, two, wachagga, names, kibo, and, kimawenzi, a, different, approach, is, to, assume, that, the, kileman, part, of, kilimanjaro, comes, from, the, kichagga, kileme, that, which, defeats, or, kilelema, that, which, has, become, difficult, or, impossible, the, jaro, part, would, then, be, derived, from, njaare, a, bird, or, according, to, other, informants, a, leopard, or, possibly, from, jyaro, a, caravan, considering, that, the, name, kilimanjaro, has, never, been, current, among, the, wachagga, people, it, is, possible, that, the, name, was, derived, from, wachagga, saying, that, the, mountain, was, unclimbable, kilemanjaare, or, kilemajyaro, and, porters, misinterpreting, this, as, being, the, name, of, the, mountain, an, alternative, explanation, suggested, by, several, sources, that, jyaro, may, be, referring, to, a, god, or, a, deity, which, protected, the, mountains, from, tresspassers, they, knew, that, birds, did, not, fly, on, the, mountain, and, local, travellers, would, become, sick, if, they, ventured, too, high, we, now, understand, this, to, be, altitude, sickness, in, the, 1880s, the, mountain, became, a, part, of, german, east, africa, and, was, called, kilima, ndscharo, in, german, following, the, kiswahili, name, components, on, 6, october, 1889, hans, meyer, reached, the, highest, summit, on, the, crater, ridge, of, kibo, he, named, it, kaiser, wilhelm, spitze, kaiser, wilhelm, peak, that, name, was, used, until, tanzania, was, formed, in, 1964, when, the, summit, was, renamed, uhuru, peak, meaning, freedom, peak, in, kiswahili, kilimanjaro, is, a, large, dormant, stratovolcano, composed, of, three, distinct, volcanic, cones, kibo, the, highest, mawenzi, at, 5, 149, m, 16, 893, ft, and, shira, the, lowest, at, 4, 005, m, 13, 140, ft, mawenzi, and, shira, are, extinct, while, kibo, is, dormant, and, could, erupt, again, uhuru, peak, is, the, highest, summit, on, kibo, s, crater, rim, the, tanzania, national, parks, authority, a, tanzanian, government, agency, and, the, united, nations, educational, scientific, and, cultural, organization, lists, the, height, of, uhuru, peak, as, 5, 895, m, 19, 341, ft, based, on, a, british, survey, in, 1952, the, height, has, since, been, measured, as, 5, 892, m, 19, 331, ft, in, 1999, 5, 902, m, 19, 364, ft, in, 2008, and, 5, 899, m, 19, 354, ft, in, 2014, a, map, of, the, kibo, cone, on, mount, kilimanjaro, was, published, by, the, british, government, s, directorate, of, overseas, surveys, dos, in, 1964, based, on, aerial, photography, conducted, in, 1962, as,

kilimanjaro, is, poorly, known, because, there, has, not, been, any, significant, erosion, to, expose, the, igneous, strata, that, comprise, the, volcano, s, structure, eruptive, activity, at, the, shira, center, commenced, about, 2, 5, million, years, ago, with, the, last, important, phase, occurring, about, 1, 9, million, years, ago, just, before, the, northern, part, of, the, edifice, collapsed, shira, is, topped, by, a, broad, plateau, at, 3, 800, m, 12, 500, ft, which, may, be, a, filled, caldera, the, remnant, caldera, rim, has, been, degraded, deeply, by, erosion, before, the,

southeast, and, the, lengurumani, plain, in, the, northwest, most, of, these, cones, are, well, preserved, except, the, saddle, plateau, cones, which, were, heavily, affected, by, glacial, action, despite, their, mostly, small, size, lava, from, the, cones, has, obscured, large, portions, of, the, mountain, the, saddle, plateau, cones, are, mostly, cinder, cones, with, terminal, effusion, of, lava, while, the, upper, rombo, zone, cones, mostly, generated, lava, flows, all, saddle, plateau, cones, predate, the, last, glaciation, according, to, reports, gathered, in, the, 19th, century, from, the, maasai, lake, chala, on, kibo, s, eastern, flank, was, the, site, of, a, village, that, was, destroyed, by, an, eruption, kibo, s, diminishing, ice, cap, exists, because, kilimanjaro, is, a, little, dissected, massive, mountain, that, rises, above, the, snow, line, the, cap, is, divergent, and, at, the, edges, splits, into, individual, glaciers, the, central, portion, of, the, ice, cap, is, interrupted, by, the, presence, of, the, kibo, crater, 5, the, summit, glaciers, and, ice, fields, do, not, display, significant, horizontal, movements, because, their, low, thickness, precludes, major, deformation, geological, evidence, shows, five, successive, glacial, episodes, during, the, quaternary, period, namely, first, 500, 000, bp, second, greater, than, 360, 000, years, ago, to, 240, 000, bp, third, 150, 000, to, 120, 000, bp, fourth, also, known, as, main, 20, 000, to, 17, 000, bp, and, little, 16, 000, to, 14, 000, bp, the, third, may, have, been, the, most, extensive, and, the, little, appears, to, be, statistically, indistinguishable, from, the, fourth, a, continuous, ice, cap, covering, approximately, 400, km, 2, 150, sq, mi, down, to, an, elevation, of, 3, 200, m, 10, 500, ft, covered, kilimanjaro, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, in, the, pleistocene, epoch, the, main, glacial, episode, extending, across, the, summits, of, kibo, and, mawenzi, because, of, the, exceptionally, prolonged, dry, conditions, during, the, subsequent, younger, dryas, stadial, the, ice, fields, on, kilimanjaro, may, have, become, extinct, around, 11, 500, years, bp, ice, cores, taken, from, kilimanjaro, s, northern, ice, field, nif, indicates, that, the, glaciers, there, have, a, basal, age, of, about, 11, 700, years, although, an, analysis, of, ice, taken, in, 2011, from, exposed, vertical, cliffs, in, the, nif, supports, an, age, extending, only, to, 800, years, bp, higher, precipitation, rates, at, the, beginning, of, the, holocene, epoch, 11,

summit, of, kibo, was, completely, covered, by, an, ice, cap, about, 20, km, 2, 7, 7, sq, mi, in, extent, with, outlet, glaciers, cascading, down, the, western, and, southern, slopes, and, except, for, the, inner, cone, the, entire, caldera, was, buried, glacier, ice, also, flowed, through, the, western, breach, the, slope, glaciers, retreated, rapidly, between, 1912, and, 1953, in, response, to, a, sudden, shift, in, climate, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, that, made, them, drastically, out, of, equilibrium, and, more, slowly, thereafter, their, continuing, demise, indicates, they, are, still, out, of, equilibrium, in, response, to, a, constant, change, in, climate, over, the, past, century, in, contrast, to, the, persistent, slope, glaciers, the, glaciers, on, kilimanjaro, s, crater, plateau, have, appeared, and, disappeared, repeatedly, during, the, holocene, epoch, with, each, cycle, lasting, a, few, hundred, years, 1088, it, appears, that, decreasing, specific, humidity, instead, of, temperature, changes, has, caused, the, shrinkage, of, the, slope, glaciers, since, the, late, 19th, century, no, clear, warming, trend, at, the, elevation, of, those, glaciers,

there, is, no, pathway, for, the, plateau, glaciers, other, than, to, continuously, retreat, once, their, vertical, margins, are, exposed, to, solar, radiation, the, kilimanjaro, glaciers, have, been, used, for, deriving, ice, core, records, including, two, from, the, southern, icefield, based, on, this, data, this, icefield, formed, between, 1, 250, and, 1, 450, years, bp, almost, 85, percent, of, the, ice, cover, on, kilimanjaro, disappeared, between, october, 1912, and, june, 2011, with, coverage, decreasing, from, 11, 40, km, 2, 4, 40, sq, mi, to, 1, 76, km, 2, 0, 68, sq, mi, 423, between, 1912, and, 1953, there, was, about, a, 1, 1, percent, average, annual, loss, of, ice, coverage, the, average, annual, loss, for, 1953, to, 1989, was, 1, 4, percent, while, the, loss, rate, for, 1989, to, 2007, was, 2, 5, percent, of, the, ice, cover, still, present, in, 2000, almost, 40, percent, had, disappeared, by, 2011, 425, ice, climber, will, gadd, noticed, differences, between, his, 2014,

glacier, mass, is, caused, by, both, melting, and, sublimation, while, the, current, shrinking, and, thinning, of, kilimanjaro, s, ice, fields, appear, to, be, unique, within, its, almost, twelve, millennium, history, it, is, contemporaneous, with, widespread, glacier, retreat, in, mid, to, low, latitudes, across, the, globe, in, 2013, it, was, estimated, that, at, the, current, rate, of, global, warming, most, of, the, ice, on, kilimanjaro, will, disappear, by, 2040, and, it, is, highly, unlikely, that, any, ice, body, will, remain, after, 2060, 430, the, furtwangler, glacier, on, kilimanjaro, is, a, remnant, of, the, ice, cap, that, once, covered, the, mountain, this, has, retreated, dramatically, over, the, last, century, with, over, 80, percent, glacial, retreat, the,

by, the, people, who, live, in, east, africa, the, chagga, who, traditionally, lived, on, the, southern, and, eastern, slopes, of, the, mountain, in, sovereign, chagga, states, tell, how, a, man, named, tone, once, provoked, a, god, ruwa, to, bring, famine, upon, the, land, the, people, became, angry, at, tone, forcing, him, to, flee, nobody, wanted, to, protect, him, but, a, solitary, dweller, who, had, stones, that, turned, miraculously, into, cattle, the, dweller, bid, that, tone, never, open, the, stable, of, the, cattle, when, tone, did, not, heed, the, warning, and, the, cattle, escaped, tone, followed, them, but, the, fleeing, cattle, threw, up, hills, to, run, on, including, mawenzi, and, kibo, tone, finally, collapsed, on, kibo, ending, the, pursuit, another, chagga, legend, tells, of, ivory, filled, graves, of, elephants, on, the, mountain, and, of, a, cow, named, rayli, that, produces, miraculous, fat, from, her, tail, glands, if, a, man, tries, to, steal, such, a, gland, but, is, too, slow, in, his, moves, rayli, will, blast, a, powerful, snort, and, blow, the, thief, down, onto, the, plain, the, mountain, may, have, been, known, to, non, africans, since, antiquity, sailors, reports, recorded, by, ptolemy, mention, a, moon, mountain, and, a, spring, lake, of, the, nile, which, may, indicate, kilimanjaro, although, available, historical, information, does, not, allow, differentiation, among, others, in, east, africa, like, mount, kenya, the, mountains, of, ethiopia, the, virunga, mountains, the, rwenzori, mountains, and, kilimanjaro, before, ptolemy, aeschylus, and, herodotus, referred, to, egypt, nurtured, by, the, snows, and, to, a, spring, between, two, mountains, respectively, one, of, these, mentions, two, tall,

the, interior, from, native, caravans, said, in, his, summa, de, geograf, a, 1519, that, west, of, mombasa, stands, the, ethiopian, mount, olympus, which, is, exceedingly, high, and, beyond, it, are, the, mountains, of, the, moon, in, which, are, the, sources, of, the, nile, 1, 5, 114, the, german, missionaries, johannes, rebmann, of, mombasa, and, johann, krapf, were, the, first, europeans, known, to, have, attempted, to, reach, the, mountain, according, to, english, geographer, halford, mackinder, and, english, explorer, harry, johnston, rebmann, in, 1848, was, the, first, european, to, report, the, existence, of, kilimanjaro, hans, meyer, has, claimed, that, rebmann, first, arrived, in, africa, in, 1846, and, quotes, rebmann, s, diary, entry, of, 11, may, 1848, as, saying, this, morning, at, 10, o, clock, we, obtained, a, clearer, view, of, the, mountains, of, jagga, the, summit, of, one, of, which, was, covered, by, what, looked, like, a, beautiful, white, cloud, when, i, inquired, as, to, the, dazzling, whiteness, the, guide, merely, called, it, cold, and, at, once, i, knew, it, could, be, neither, more, nor, less, than, snow, immediately, i, understood, how, to, interpret, the, marvelous, tales, dr, krapf, and, i, had, heard, at, the, coast, of, a, vast, mountain, of, gold, and, silver, in, the, far, interior, the, approach, to, which, was, guarded, by, evil, spirits, 6, in, august, 1861, the, prussian, officer, baron, karl, klaus, von, der, decken, accompanied, by, english, geologist, richard, thornton, attempted, to, climb, kibo, but, got, no, farther, than, 2, 500, m, 8, 200, ft, owing, to, the, inclemency, of, the, weather, 9, in, december, 1862, von, der, decken, tried, a, second, time, together, with, otto, kersten, reaching, a, height, of, 4, 300, m, 14, 000, ft, in, august, 1871, missionary, charles, new, became, the, first, european, to, reach, the, equatorial, snows, on, kilimanjaro, at, an, elevation, of, slightly, more, than, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, 11, in, june, 1887, the, hungarian, count, s, muel, teleki, and, the, austrian, lieutenant, ludwig, von, h, hnel, made, an, attempt, to, climb, the, mountain, approaching, from, the, saddle, between, mawenzi, and, kibo, h, hnel, stopped, at, 4, 950, m, 16, 240, ft, but, teleki, continued, until, he, reached, the, snow, at, 5, 300, m, 17, 400, ft, later, in, 1887, the, german, geology, professor, hans, meyer, reached, the, lower, edge, of, the, ice, cap, on, kibo, where, he, was, forced, to, turn, back, because, he, lacked, the, equipment, needed, to, progress, across, the, ice, 81, the, following, year, meyer, planned, another, attempt, with, oscar, baumann, a, cartographer, but, the, mission, was, aborted, after, the, pair, were, held, hostage, and, ransomed, during, the, abushiri, revolt, 82, in, the, autumn, of, 1888, the, american, naturalist, abbott, and, the, german, explorer, otto, ehrenfried, ehlers, approached, the, summit, from, the, northwest, while, abbott, turned, back, earlier, ehlers, at, first, claimed, to, have, reached, the, summit, rim, but, after, severe, criticism, of, the, claim, withdrew, it, 17, 19, in, 1889, meyer, returned, to,
