90, n, 0, e, 90, n, 0, e, 90, 0, the, north, pole, also, known, as, the, geographic, north, pole, terrestrial, north, pole, or, 90th, parallel, north, is, the, point, in, the, northern, hemisphere, where, the, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, meets, its, surface, it, is, called, the, true, north, pole, to, distinguish, from, the, magnetic, north, pole, the, north, pole, is, by, definition, the, northernmost, point, on, the, earth, lying, antipodally, to, the, south, pole, it, defines, geodetic, latitude, 90, north, as, well, as, the, direction, of, true, north, at, the, north, pole, all, directions, point, south, all, lines, of, longitude, converge, there, so, its, longitude, can, be, defined, as, any, degree, value, no, time, zone, has, been, assigned, to, the, north, pole, so, any, time, can, be, used, as, the, local, time, along, tight, latitude, circles, counterclockwise, is, east, and, clockwise, is, west, the, north, pole, is, at, the, center, of, the, northern, hemisphere, the, nearest, land, is, usually, said, to, be, kaffeklubben, island, off, the, northern, coast, of, greenland, about, 700, km, 430, mi, away, though, some, perhaps, semi, permanent, gravel, banks, lie, slightly, closer, the, nearest, permanently, inhabited, place, is, alert, on, ellesmere, island, canada, which, is, located, 817, km, 508, mi, from, the, pole, while, the, south, pole, lies, on, a, continental, land, mass, the, north, pole, is, located, in, the, middle, of, the, arctic, ocean, amid, waters, that, are, almost, permanently, covered, with, constantly, shifting, sea, ice, the, sea, depth, at, the, north, pole, has, been, measured, at, 4, 261, m, 13, 980, ft, by, the, russian, mir, submersible, in, 2007, and, at, 4, 087, m, 13, 409, ft, by, uss, nautilus, in, 1958, this, makes, it, impractical, to, construct, a, permanent, station, at, the, north, pole, unlike, the, south, pole, however, the, soviet, union, and, later, russia, constructed, a, number, of, manned, drifting, stations, on, a, generally, annual, basis, since, 1937, some, of, which, have, passed, over, or, very, close, to, the, pole, since, 2002, a, group, of, russians, have, also, annually, established, a, private, base, barneo, close, to, the, pole, this, operates, for, a, few, weeks, during, early, spring, studies, in, the, 2000s, predicted, that, the, north, pole, may, become, seasonally, ice, free, because, of, arctic, ice, shrinkage, with, timescales, varying, from, 2016, to, the, late, 21st, century, or, later, attempts, to, reach, the, north, pole, began, in, the, late, 19th, century, with, the, record, for, farthest, north, being, surpassed, on, numerous, occasions, the, first, undisputed, expedition, to, reach, the, north, pole, was, that, of, the, airship, norge, which, overflew, the, area, in, 1926, with, 16, men, on, board, including, expedition, leader, roald, amundsen, three, prior, expeditions, led, by, frederick, cook, 1908, land, robert, peary, 1909, land, and, richard, e, byrd, 1926, aerial, were, once, also, accepted, as, having, reached, the, pole, however, in, each, case, later, analysis, of, expedition, data, has, cast, doubt, upon, the, accuracy, of, their, claims, the, first, verified, individuals, to, reach, the, north, pole, on, the, ground, was, in, 1948, by, a, 24, man, soviet, party, part, of, aleksandr, kuznetsov, s, sever, 2, expedition, to, the, arctic, who, flew, part, way, to, the, pole, first, before, making, the, final, trek, to, the, pole, on, foot, the, first, complete, land, expedition, to, reach, the, north, pole, was, in, 1968, by, ralph, plaisted, walt, pederson, gerry, pitzl, and, jean, luc, bombardier, using, snowmobiles, and, with, air, support, the, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, and, hence, the, position, of, the, north, pole, was, commonly, believed, to, be, fixed, relative, to, the, surface, of, the, earth, until, in, the, 18th, century, the, mathematician, leonhard, euler, predicted, that, the, axis, might, wobble, slightly, around, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, astronomers, noticed, a, small, apparent, variation, of, latitude, as, determined, for, a, fixed, point, on, earth, from, the, observation, of, stars, part, of, this, variation, could, be, attributed, to, a, wandering, of, the, pole, across, the, earth, s, surface, by, a, range, of, a, few, metres, the, wandering, has, several, periodic, components, and, an, irregular, component, the, component, with, a, period, of, about, 435, days, is, identified, with, the, eight, month, wandering, predicted, by, euler, and, is, now, called, the, chandler, wobble, after, its, discoverer, the, exact, point, of, intersection, of, the, earth, s, axis, and, the, earth, s, surface, at, any, given, moment, is, called, the, instantaneous, pole, but, because, of, the, wobble, this, cannot, be, used, as, a, definition, of, a, fixed, north, pole, or, south, pole, when, metre, scale, precision, is, required, it, is, desirable, to, tie, the, system, of, earth, coordinates, latitude, longitude, and, elevations, or, orography, to, fixed, landforms, however, given, plate, tectonics, and, isostasy, there, is, no, system, in, which, all, geographic, features, are, fixed, yet, the, international, earth, rotation, and, reference, systems, service, and, the, international, astronomical, union, have, defined, a, framework, called, the, international, terrestrial, reference, system, as, early, as, the, 16th, century, many, prominent, people, correctly, believed, that, the, north, pole, was, in, a, sea, which, in, the, 19th, century, was, called, the, polynya, or, open, polar, sea, it, was, therefore, hoped, that, passage, could, be, found, through, ice, floes, at, favorable, times, of, the, year, several, expeditions, set, out, to, find, the, way, generally, with, whaling, ships, already, commonly, used, in, the, cold, northern, latitudes, one, of, the, earliest, expeditions, to, set, out, with, the, explicit, intention, of, reaching, the, north, pole, was, that, of, british, naval, officer, william, edward, parry, who, in, 1827, reached, latitude, 82, 45, north, in, 1871, the, polaris, expedition, a, us, attempt, on, the, pole, led, by, charles, francis, hall, ended, in, disaster, another, british, royal, navy, attempt, to, get, to, the, pole, part, of, the, british, arctic, expedition, by, commander, albert, h, markham, reached, a, then, record, 83, 20, 26, north, in, may, 1876, before, turning, back, an, 1879, 1881, expedition, commanded, by, us, naval, officer, george, w, de, long, ended, tragically, when, their, ship, the, uss, jeannette, was, crushed, by, ice, over, half, the, crew, including, de, long, were, lost, in, april, 1895, the, norwegian, explorers, fridtjof, nansen, and, hjalmar, johansen, struck, out, for, the, pole, on, skis, after, leaving, nansen, s, icebound, ship, fram, the, pair, reached, latitude, 86, 14, north, before, they, abandoned, the, attempt, and, turned, southwards, eventually, reaching, franz, josef, land, in, 1897, swedish, engineer, salomon, august, andr, e, and, two, companions, tried, to, reach, the, north, pole, in, the, hydrogen, balloon, rnen, eagle, but, came, down, 300, km, 190, mi, north, of, kvit, ya, the, northeasternmost, part, of, the, svalbard, archipelago, they, trekked, to, kvit, ya, but, died, there, three, months, after, their, crash, in, 1930, the, remains, of, this, expedition, were, found, by, the, norwegian, bratvaag, expedition, the, italian, explorer, luigi, amedeo, duke, of, the, abruzzi, and, captain, umberto, cagni, of, the, italian, royal, navy, regia, marina, sailed, the, converted, whaler, stella, polare, pole, star, from, norway, in, 1899, on, 11, march, 1900, cagni, led, a, party, over, the, ice, and, reached, latitude, 86, 34, on, 25, april, setting, a, new, record, by, beating, nansen, s, result, of, 1895, by, 35, to, 40, km, 22, to, 25, mi, cagni, barely, managed, to, return, to, the, camp, remaining, there, until, 23, june, on, 16, august, the, stella, polare, left, rudolf, island, heading, south, and, the, expedition, returned, to, norway, the, us, explorer, frederick, cook, claimed, to, have, reached, the, north, pole, on, 21, april, 1908, with, two, inuit, men, ahwelah, and, etukishook, but, he, was, unable, to, produce, convincing, proof, and, his, claim, is, not, widely, accepted, the, conquest, of, the, north, pole, was, for, many, years, credited, to, us, navy, engineer, robert, peary, who, claimed, to, have, reached, the, pole, on, 6, april, 1909, accompanied, by, matthew, henson, and, four, inuit, men, ootah, seeglo, egingwah, and, ooqueah, however, peary, s, claim, remains, highly, disputed, and, controversial, those, who, accompanied, peary, on, the, final, stage, of, the, journey, were, not, trained, in, navigation, and, thus, could, not, independently, confirm, his, navigational, work, which, some, claim, to, have, been, particularly, sloppy, as, he, approached, the, pole, the, distances, and, speeds, that, peary, claimed, to, have, achieved, once, the, last, support, party, turned, back, seem, incredible, to, many, people, almost, three, times, that, which, he, had, accomplished, up, to, that, point, peary, s, account, of, a, journey, to, the, pole, and, back, while, traveling, along, the, direct, line, the, only, strategy, that, is, consistent, with, the, time, constraints, that, he, was, facing, is, contradicted, by, henson, s, account, of, tortuous, detours, to, avoid, pressure, ridges, and, open, leads, the, british, explorer, wally, herbert, initially, a, supporter, of, peary, researched, peary, s, records, in, 1989, and, found, that, there, were, significant, discrepancies, in, the, explorer, s, navigational, records, he, concluded, that, peary, had, not, reached, the, pole, support, for, peary, came, again, in, 2005, however, when, british, explorer, tom, avery, and, four, companions, recreated, the, outward, portion, of, peary, s, journey, with, replica, wooden, sleds, and, canadian, eskimo, dog, teams, reaching, the, north, pole, in, 36, days, 22, hours, nearly, five, hours, faster, than, peary, however, avery, s, fastest, 5, day, march, was, 90, nautical, miles, 170, km, significantly, short, of, the, 135, nautical, miles, 250, km, claimed, by, peary, avery, writes, on, his, web, site, that, the, admiration, and, respect, which, i, hold, for, robert, peary, matthew, henson, and, the, four, inuit, men, who, ventured, north, in, 1909, has, grown, enormously, since, we, set, out, from, cape, columbia, having, now, seen, for, myself, how, he, travelled, across, the, pack, ice, i, am, more, convinced, than, ever, that, peary, did, indeed, discover, the, north, pole, the, first, claimed, flight, over, the, pole, was, made, on, 9, may, 1926, by, us, naval, officer, richard, e, byrd, and, pilot, floyd, bennett, in, a, fokker, tri, motor, aircraft, although, verified, at, the, time, by, a, committee, of, the, national, geographic, society, this, claim, has, since, been, undermined, by, the, 1996, revelation, that, byrd, s, long, hidden, diary, s, solar, sextant, data, which, the, ngs, never, checked, consistently, contradict, his, june, 1926, report, s, parallel, data, by, over, 100, mi, 160, km, the, secret, report, s, alleged, en, route, solar, sextant, data, were, inadvertently, so, impossibly, overprecise, that, he, excised, all, these, alleged, raw, solar, observations, out, of, the, version, of, the, report, finally, sent, to, geographical, societies, five, months, later, while, the, original, version, was, hidden, for, 70, years, a, realization, first, published, in, 2000, by, the, university, of, cambridge, after, scrupulous, refereeing, the, first, consistent, verified, and, scientifically, convincing, attainment, of, the, pole, was, on, 12, may, 1926, by, norwegian, explorer, roald, amundsen, and, his, us, sponsor, lincoln, ellsworth, from, the, airship, norge, norge, though, norwegian, owned, was, designed, and, piloted, by, the, italian, umberto, nobile, the, flight, started, from, svalbard, in, norway, and, crossed, the, arctic, ocean, to, alaska, nobile, with, several, scientists, and, crew, from, the, norge, overflew, the, pole, a, second, time, on, 24, may, 1928, in, the, airship, italia, the, italia, crashed, on, its, return, from, the, pole, with, the, loss, of, half, the, crew, another, transpolar, flight, was, accomplished, in, a, tupolev, ant, 25, airplane, with, a, crew, of, valery, chkalov, georgy, baydukov, and, alexander, belyakov, who, flew, over, the, north, pole, on, 19, june, 1937, during, their, direct, flight, from, the, soviet, union, to, the, usa, without, any, stopover, in, may, 1937, the, world, s, first, north, pole, ice, station, north, pole, 1, was, established, by, soviet, scientists, 20, kilometres, 13, mi, from, the, north, pole, after, the, ever, first, landing, of, four, heavy, and, one, light, aircraft, onto, the, ice, at, the, north, pole, the, expedition, members, oceanographer, pyotr, shirshov, meteorologist, yevgeny, fyodorov, radio, operator, ernst, krenkel, and, the, leader, ivan, papanin, conducted, scientific, research, at, the, station, for, the, next, nine, months, by, 19, february, 1938, when, the, group, was, picked, up, by, the, ice, breakers, taimyr, and, murman, their, station, had, drifted, 2850, km, to, the, eastern, coast, of, greenland, in, may, 1945, an, raf, lancaster, of, the, aries, expedition, became, the, first, commonwealth, aircraft, to, overfly, the, north, geographic, and, north, magnetic, poles, the, plane, was, piloted, by, david, cecil, mckinley, of, the, royal, air, force, it, carried, an, 11, man, crew, with, kenneth, c, maclure, of, the, royal, canadian, air, force, in, charge, of, all, scientific, observations, in, 2006, maclure, was, honoured, with, a, spot, in, canada, s, aviation, hall, of, fame, discounting, peary, s, disputed, claim, the, first, men, to, set, foot, at, the, north, pole, were, a, soviet, party, including, geophysicists, mikhail, ostrekin, and, pavel, senko, oceanographers, mikhail, somov, and, pavel, gordienko, and, other, scientists, and, flight, crew, 24, people, in, total, of, aleksandr, kuznetsov, s, sever, 2, expedition, march, may, 1948, it, was, organized, by, the, chief, directorate, of, the, northern, sea, route, the, party, flew, on, three, planes, pilots, ivan, cherevichnyy, vitaly, maslennikov, and, ilya, kotov, from, kotelny, island, to, the, north, pole, and, landed, there, at, 4, 44pm, moscow, time, utc, 04, 00, on, 23, april, 1948, they, established, a, temporary, camp, and, for, the, next, two, days, conducted, scientific, observations, on, 26, april, the, expedition, flew, back, to, the, continent, next, year, on, 9, may, 1949, two, other, soviet, scientists, vitali, volovich, and, andrei, medvedev, became, the, first, people, to, parachute, onto, the, north, pole, they, jumped, from, a, douglas, c, 47, skytrain, registered, cccp, h, 369, on, 3, may, 1952, u, s, air, force, lieutenant, colonel, joseph, o, fletcher, and, lieutenant, william, pershing, benedict, along, with, scientist, albert, p, crary, landed, a, modified, douglas, c, 47, skytrain, at, the, north, pole, some, western, sources, considered, this, to, be, the, first, landing, at, the, pole, until, the, soviet, landings, became, widely, known, the, united, states, navy, submarine, uss, nautilus, ssn, 571, crossed, the, north, pole, on, 3, august, 1958, on, 17, march, 1959, uss, skate, ssn, 578, surfaced, at, the, pole, breaking, through, the, ice, above, it, becoming, the, first, naval, vessel, to, do, so, the, first, confirmed, surface, conquest, of, the, north, pole, was, accomplished, by, ralph, plaisted, walt, pederson, gerry, pitzl, and, jean, luc, bombardier, who, traveled, over, the, ice, by, snowmobile, and, arrived, on, 19, april, 1968, the, united, states, air, force, independently, confirmed, their, position, on, 6, april, 1969, wally, herbert, and, companions, allan, gill, roy, koerner, and, kenneth, hedges, of, the, british, trans, arctic, expedition, became, the, first, men, to, reach, the, north, pole, on, foot, albeit, with, the, aid, of, dog, teams, and, airdrops, they, continued, on, to, complete, the, first, surface, crossing, of, the, arctic, ocean, and, by, its, longest, axis, barrow, alaska, to, svalbard, a, feat, that, has, never, been, repeated, because, of, suggestions, later, proven, false, of, plaisted, s, use, of, air, transport, some, sources, classify, herbert, s, expedition, as, the, first, confirmed, to, reach, the, north, pole, over, the, ice, surface, by, any, means, in, the, 1980s, plaisted, s, pilots, weldy, phipps, and, ken, lee, signed, affidavits, asserting, that, no, such, airlift, was, provided, it, is, also, said, that, herbert, was, the, first, person, to, reach, the, pole, of, inaccessibility, on, 17, august, 1977, the, soviet, nuclear, powered, icebreaker, arktika, completed, the, first, surface, vessel, journey, to, the, north, pole, in, 1982, ranulph, fiennes, and, charles, r, burton, became, the, first, people, to, cross, the, arctic, ocean, in, a, single, season, they, departed, from, cape, crozier, ellesmere, island, on, 17, february, 1982, and, arrived, at, the, geographic, north, pole, on, 10, april, 1982, they, travelled, on, foot, and, snowmobile, from, the, pole, they, travelled, towards, svalbard, but, due, to, the, unstable, nature, of, the, ice, ended, their, crossing, at, the, ice, edge, after, drifting, south, on, an, ice, floe, for, 99, days, they, were, eventually, able, to, walk, to, their, expedition, ship, mv, benjamin, bowring, and, boarded, it, on, 4, august, 1982, at, position, 80, 31n, 00, 59w, as, a, result, of, this, journey, which, formed, a, section, of, the, three, year, transglobe, expedition, 1979, 1982, fiennes, and, burton, became, the, first, people, to, complete, a, circumnavigation, of, the, world, via, both, north, and, south, poles, by, surface, travel, alone, this, achievement, remains, unchallenged, to, this, day, the, expedition, crew, included, a, jack, russell, terrier, named, bothie, who, became, the, first, dog, to, visit, both, poles, in, 1985, sir, edmund, hillary, the, first, man, to, stand, on, the, summit, of, mount, everest, and, neil, armstrong, the, first, man, to, stand, on, the, moon, landed, at, the, north, pole, in, a, small, twin, engined, ski, plane, hillary, thus, became, the, first, man, to, stand, at, both, poles, and, on, the, summit, of, everest, in, 1986, will, steger, with, seven, teammates, became, the, first, to, be, confirmed, as, reaching, the, pole, by, dogsled, and, without, resupply, uss, gurnard, ssn, 662, operated, in, the, arctic, ocean, under, the, polar, ice, cap, from, september, to, november, 1984, in, company, with, one, of, her, sister, ships, the, attack, submarine, uss, pintado, ssn, 672, on, 12, november, 1984, gurnard, and, pintado, became, the, third, pair, of, submarines, to, surface, together, at, the, north, pole, in, march, 1990, gurnard, deployed, to, the, arctic, region, during, exercise, ice, ex, 90, and, completed, only, the, fourth, winter, submerged, transit, of, the, bering, and, seas, gurnard, surfaced, at, the, north, pole, on, 18, april, in, the, company, of, the, uss, seahorse, ssn, 669, on, 6, may, 1986, uss, archerfish, ssn, 678, uss, ray, ssn, 653, and, uss, hawkbill, ssn, 666, surfaced, at, the, north, pole, the, first, tri, submarine, surfacing, at, the, north, pole, on, 21, april, 1987, shinji, kazama, of, japan, became, the, first, person, to, reach, the, north, pole, on, a, motorcycle, on, 18, may, 1987, uss, billfish, ssn, 676, uss, sea, devil, ssn, 664, and, hms, superb, s, 109, surfaced, at, the, north, pole, the, first, international, surfacing, at, the, north, pole, in, 1988, a, team, of, 13, 9, soviets, 4, canadians, skied, across, the, arctic, from, siberia, to, northern, canada, one, of, the, canadians, richard, weber, became, the, first, person, to, reach, the, pole, from, both, sides, of, the, arctic, ocean, on, april, 16, 1990, a, german, swiss, expedition, led, by, a, team, of, the, university, of, giessen, reached, the, geographic, north, pole, for, studies, on, pollution, of, pack, ice, snow, and, air, samples, taken, were, analyzed, in, cooperation, with, the, geological, survey, of, canada, and, the, alfred, wegener, institute, for, polar, and, marine, research, further, stops, for, sample, collections, were, on, multi, year, sea, ice, at, 86, n, at, cape, columbia, and, ward, hunt, island, on, 4, may, 1990, b, rge, ousland, and, erling, kagge, became, the, first, explorers, ever, to, reach, the, north, pole, unsupported, after, a, 58, day, ski, trek, from, ellesmere, island, in, canada, a, distance, of, 800, km, on, 7, september, 1991, the, german, research, vessel, polarstern, and, the, swedish, icebreaker, oden, reached, the, north, pole, as, the, first, conventional, powered, vessels, both, scientific, parties, and, crew, took, oceanographic, and, geological, samples, and, had, a, common, tug, of, war, and, a, football, game, on, an, ice, floe, polarstern, again, reached, the, pole, exactly, 10, years, later, with, the, healy, in, 1998, 1999, and, 2000, lada, niva, marshs, special, very, large, wheeled, versions, made, by, bronto, lada, vaz, s, experimental, product, division, were, driven, to, the, north, pole, the, 1998, expedition, was, dropped, by, parachute, and, completed, the, track, to, the, north, pole, the, 2000, expedition, departed, from, a, russian, research, base, around, 114, km, from, the, pole, and, claimed, an, average, speed, of, 20, 15, km, h, in, an, average, temperature, of, 30, c, commercial, airliner, flights, on, the, polar, routes, may, pass, within, viewing, distance, of, the, north, pole, for, example, a, flight, from, chicago, to, beijing, may, come, close, as, latitude, 89, n, though, because, of, prevailing, winds, return, journeys, go, over, the, bering, strait, in, recent, years, journeys, to, the, north, pole, by, air, landing, by, helicopter, or, on, a, runway, prepared, on, the, ice, or, by, icebreaker, have, become, relatively, routine, and, are, even, available, to, small, groups, of, tourists, through, adventure, holiday, companies, parachute, jumps, have, frequently, been, made, onto, the, north, pole, in, recent, years, the, temporary, seasonal, russian, camp, of, barneo, has, been, established, by, air, a, short, distance, from, the, pole, annually, since, 2002, and, caters, for, scientific, researchers, as, well, as, tourist, parties, trips, from, the, camp, to, the, pole, itself, may, be, arranged, overland, or, by, helicopter, the, first, attempt, at, underwater, exploration, of, the,

the, next, attempted, dive, at, the, north, pole, was, organized, the, next, year, by, the, same, diving, club, and, ended, in, success, on, 24, april, 1999, the, divers, were, michael, wolff, austria, brett, cormick, uk, and, bob, wass, usa, in, 2005, the, united, states, navy, submarine, uss, charlotte, ssn, 766, surfaced, through, 155, cm, 61, in, of, ice, at, the, north, pole, and, spent, 18, hours, there, in, july, 2007, british, endurance, swimmer, lewis, gordon, pugh, completed, a, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, swim, at, the, north, pole, his, feat, undertaken, to, highlight, the, effects, of, global, warming, took, place, in, clear, water, that, had, opened, up, between, the, ice, floes, his, later, attempt, to, paddle, a, kayak, to, the, north, pole, in, late, 2008, following, the, erroneous, prediction, of, clear, water, to, the, pole, was, stymied, when, his, expedition, found, itself, stuck, in, thick, ice, after, only, three, days, the, expedition, was, then, abandoned, by, september, 2007, the, north, pole, had, been, visited, 66, times, by, different, surface, ships, 54, times, by, soviet, and, russian, icebreakers, 4, times, by, swedish, oden, 3, times, by, german, polarstern, 3, times, by, uscgc, healy, and, uscgc, polar, sea, and, once, by, ccgs, louis, s, st, laurent, and, by, swedish, vidar, viking, on, 2, august, 2007, a, russian, scientific, expedition, arktika, 2007, made, the, first, ever, manned, descent, to, the, ocean, floor, at, the, north, pole, to, a, depth, of, 4, 3, km, 2, 7, mi, as, part, of, the, research, programme, in, support, of, russia, s, 2001, extended, continental, shelf, claim, to, a, large, swathe, of, the, arctic, ocean, floor, the, descent, took, place, in, two, mir, submersibles, and, was, led, by, soviet, and, russian, polar, explorer, artur, chilingarov, in, a, symbolic, act, of, visitation, the, russian, flag, was, placed, on, the, ocean, floor, exactly, at, the, pole, the, expedition, was, the, latest, in, a, series, of, efforts, intended, to, give, russia, a, dominant, influence, in, the, arctic, according, to, the, new, york, times, in, 2009, the, russian, marine, live, ice, automobile, expedition, mlae, 2009, with, vasily, elagin, as, a, leader, and, a, team, of, afanasy, makovnev, vladimir, obikhod, alexey, shkrabkin, sergey, larin, alexey, ushakov, and, nikolay, nikulshin, reached, the, north, pole, on, two, custom, built, 6, x, 6, low, pressure, tire, atvs, the, vehicles, yemelya, 1, and, yemelya, 2, were, designed, by, vasily, elagin, a, russian, mountain, climber, explorer, and, engineer, they, reached, the, north, pole, on, 26, april, 2009, 17, 30, moscow, time, the, expedition, was, partly, supported, by, russian, state, aviation, the, russian, book, of, records, recognized, it, as, the, first, successful, vehicle, trip, from, land, to, the, geographical, north, pole, on, 1, march, 2013, the, russian, marine, live, ice, automobile, expedition, mlae, 2013, with, vasily, elagin, as, a, leader, and, a, team, of, afanasy, makovnev, vladimir, obikhod, alexey, shkrabkin, andrey, vankov, sergey, isayev, and, nikolay, kozlov, on, two, custom, built, 6, x, 6, low, pressure, tire, atvs, yemelya, 3, and, yemelya, 4, started, from, golomyanny, island, the, severnaya, zemlya, archipelago, to, the, north, pole, across, drifting, ice, of, the, arctic, ocean, the, vehicles, reached, the, pole, on, 6, april, and, then, continued, to, the, canadian, coast, the, coast, was, reached, on, 30, april, 2013, 83, 08n, 075, 59w, ward, hunt, island, and, on, 5, may, 2013, the, expedition, finished, in, resolute, bay, nu, the, way, between, the, russian, borderland, machtovyi, island, of, the, severnaya, zemlya, archipelago, 80, 15n, 097, 27e, and, the, canadian, coast, ward, hunt, island, 83, 08n, 075, 59w, took, 55, days, it, was, 2300, km, across, drifting, ice, and, about, 4000, km, in, total, the, expedition, was, totally, self, dependent, and, used, no, external, supplies, the, expedition, was, supported, by, the, russian, geographical, society, the, sun, at, the, north, pole, is, continuously, above, the, horizon, during, the, summer, and, continuously, below, the, horizon, during, the, winter, sunrise, is, just, before, the, march, equinox, around, 20, march, the, sun, then, takes, three, months, to, reach, its, highest, point, of, near, 23, elevation, at, the, summer, solstice, around, 21, june, after, which, time, it, begins, to, sink, reaching, sunset, just, after, the, september, equinox, around, 23, september, when, the, sun, is, visible, in, the, polar, sky, it, appears, to, move, in, a, horizontal, circle, above, the, horizon, this, circle, gradually, rises, from, near, the, horizon, just, after, the, vernal, equinox, to, its, maximum, elevation, in, degrees, above, the, horizon, at, summer, solstice, and, then, sinks, back, toward, the, horizon, before, sinking, below, it, at, the, autumnal, equinox, hence, the, north, and, south, poles, experience, the, slowest, rates, of, sunrise, and, sunset, on, earth, the, twilight, period, that, occurs, before, sunrise, and, after, sunset, has, three, different, definitions, these, effects, are, caused, by, a, combination, of, the, earth, s, axial, tilt, and, its, revolution, around, the, sun, the, direction, of, the, earth, s, axial, tilt, as, well, as, its, angle, relative, to, the, plane, of, the, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, remains, very, nearly, constant, over, the, course, of, a, year, both, change, very, slowly, over, long, time, periods, at, northern, midsummer, the, north, pole, is, facing, towards, the, sun, to, its, maximum, extent, as, the, year, progresses, and, the, earth, moves, around, the, sun, the, north, pole, gradually, turns, away, from, the, sun, until, at, midwinter, it, is, facing, away, from, the, sun, to, its, maximum, extent, a, similar, sequence, is, observed, at, the, south, pole, with, a, six, month, time, difference, since, longitude, is, undefined, at, the, north, pole, the, exact, time, is, a, matter, of, convention, polar, expeditions, use, whatever, time, is, most, convenient, such, as, greenwich, mean, time, or, the, time, zone, of, their, origin, the, north, pole, is, substantially, warmer, than, the, south, pole, because, it, lies, at, sea, level, in, the, middle, of, an, ocean, which, acts, as, a, reservoir, of, heat, rather, than, at, altitude, on, a, continental, land, mass, despite, being, an, ice, cap, the, northernmost, weather, station, in, greenland, has, a, tundra, climate, k, ppen, et, due, to, the, july, and, august, mean, temperatures, peaking, just, above, freezing, winter, temperatures, at, the, northernmost, weather, station, in, greenland, can, range, from, about, 50, to, 13, c, 58, to, 9, f, averaging, around, 31, c, 24, f, with, the, north, pole, being, slightly, colder, however, a, freak, storm, caused, the, temperature, to, reach, 0, 7, c, 33, 3, f, for, a, time, at, a, world, meteorological, organization, buoy, located, at, 87, 45, n, on, 30, december, 2015, it, was, estimated, that, the, temperature, at, the, north, pole, was, between, 1, and, 2, c, 30, and, 35, f, during, the, storm, summer, temperatures, june, july, and, august, average, around, the, freezing, point, 0, c, 32, f, the, highest, temperature, yet, recorded, is, 13, c, 55, f, much, warmer, than, the, south, pole, s, record, high, of, only, 12, 3, c, 9, 9, f, a, similar, spike, in, temperatures, occurred, on, 15, november, 2016, when, temperatures, hit, freezing, yet, again, february, 2018, featured, a, storm, so, powerful, that, temperatures, at, cape, morris, jesup, the, world, s, northernmost, weather, station, in, greenland, reached, 6, 1, c, 43, 0, f, and, spent, 24, straight, hours, above, freezing, meanwhile, the, pole, itself, was, estimated, to, reach, a, high, temperature, of, 1, 6, c, 34, 9, f, this, same, temperature, of, 1, 6, c, 34, 9, f, was, also, recorded, at, the, hollywood, burbank, airport, in, los, angeles, at, the, very, same, time, the, sea, ice, at, the, north, pole, is, typically, around, 2, to, 3, m, 6, ft, 7, in, to, 9, ft, 10, in, thick, although, ice, thickness, its, spatial, extent, and, the, fraction, of, open, water, within, the, ice, pack, can, vary, rapidly, and, profoundly, in, response, to, weather, and, climate, studies, have, shown, that, the, average, ice, thickness, has, decreased, in, recent, years, it, is, likely, that, global, warming, has, contributed, to, this, but, it, is, not, possible, to, attribute, the, recent, abrupt, decrease, in, thickness, entirely, to, the, observed, warming, in, the, arctic, reports, have, also, predicted, that, within, a, few, decades, the, arctic, ocean, will, be, entirely, free, of, ice, in, the, summer, this, may, have, significant, commercial, implications, see, territorial, claims, below, the, retreat, of, the, arctic, sea, ice, will, accelerate, global, warming, as, less, ice, cover, reflects, less, solar, radiation, and, may, have, serious, climate, implications, by, contributing, to, arctic, cyclone, generation, polar, bears, are, believed, to, travel, rarely, beyond, about, 82, north, owing, to, the, scarcity, of, food, though, tracks, have, been, seen, in, the, vicinity, of, the, north, pole, and, a, 2006, expedition, reported, sighting, a, polar, bear, just, 1, mi, 1, 6, km, from, the, pole, the, ringed, seal, has, also, been, seen, at, the, pole, and, arctic, foxes, have, been, observed, less, than, 60, km, 37, mi, away, at, 89, 40, n, birds, seen, at, or, very, near, the, pole, include, the, snow, bunting, northern, fulmar, and, black, legged, kittiwake, though, some, bird, sightings, may, be, distorted, by, the, tendency, of, birds, to, follow, ships, and, expeditions, fish, have, been, seen, in, the, waters, at, the, north, pole, but, these, are, probably, few, in, number, a, member, of, the, russian, team, that, descended, to, the, north, pole, seabed, in, august, 2007, reported, seeing, no, sea, creatures, living, there, however, it, was, later, reported, that, a, sea, anemone, had, been, scooped, up, from, the, seabed, mud, by, the, russian, team, and, that, video, footage, from, the, dive, showed, unidentified, shrimps, and, amphipods, currently, under, international, law, no, country, owns, the, north, pole, or, the, region, of, the, arctic, ocean, surrounding, it, the, five, surrounding, arctic, countries, russia, canada, norway,

extended, continental, shelf, beyond, its, 200, mile, exclusive, economic, zone, if, validated, such, a, claim, gives, the, claimant, state, rights, to, what, may, be, on, or, beneath, the, sea, bottom, within, the, claimed, zone, norway, ratified, the, convention, in, 1996, russia, ratified, in, 1997, canada, ratified, in, 2003, and, denmark, ratified, in, 2004, have, all, launched, projects, to, base, claims, that, certain, areas, of, arctic, continental, shelves, should, be, subject, to, their, sole, sovereign, exploitation, in, 1907, canada, invoked, the, sector, principle, to, claim, sovereignty, over, a, sector, stretching, from, its, coasts, to, the, north, pole, this, claim, has, not, been, relinquished, but, was, not, consistently, pressed, until, 2013, in, some, children, s, christmas, legends, and, western, folklore, the, geographic, north, pole, is, described, as, the, location, of, santa, claus, workshop, and, residence, canada, post, has, assigned, postal, code, h0h, 0h0, to, the, north, pole, referring, to, santa, s, traditional, exclamation, of, ho, ho, ho, this, association, reflects, an, age, old, esoteric, mythology, of, hyperborea, that, posits, the, north, pole, the, otherworldly, world, axis, as, the, abode, of, god, and, superhuman, beings, as, henry, corbin, has, documented, the, north, pole, plays, a, key, part, in, the, cultural, worldview, of, sufism, and, iranian, mysticism, the, orient, sought, by, the, mystic, the, orient, that, cannot, be, located, on, our, maps, is, in, the, direction, of, the, north, beyond, the, north, in, mandaean, cosmology, the, north, pole, and, polaris, are, considered, to, be, auspicious, since, they, are, associated, with, the, world, of, light, mandaeans, face, north, when, praying, and, temples, are, also, oriented, towards, the, north, on, the, contrary, south, is, associated, with, the, world, of, darkness, owing, to, its, remoteness, the, pole, is, sometimes, identified, with, a, mysterious, mountain, of, ancient, iranian, tradition, called, mount, qaf, jabal, qaf, the, farthest, point, of, the, earth, according, to, certain, authors, the, jabal, qaf, of,
