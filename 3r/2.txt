exploration, is, the, process, of, exploring, an, activity, which, has, some, expectation, of, discovery, organised, exploration, is, largely, a, human, activity, but, exploratory, activity, is, common, to, most, organisms, capable, of, directed, locomotion, and, the, ability, to, learn, and, has, been, described, in, amongst, others, social, insects, foraging, behaviour, where, feedback, from, returning, individuals, affects, the, activity, of, other, members, of, the, group, geographical, exploration, sometimes, considered, the, default, meaning, for, the, more, general, term, exploration, is, the, practice, of, discovering, lands, and, regions, of, the, planet, earth, remote, or, relatively, inaccessible, from, the, origin, of, the, explorer, the, surface, of, the, earth, not, covered, by, water, has, been, relatively, comprehensively, explored, as, access, is, generally, relatively, straightforward, but, underwater, and, subterranean, areas, are, far, less, known, and, even, at, the, surface, much, is, still, to, be, discovered, in, detail, in, the, more, remote, and, inaccessible, wilderness, areas, two, major, eras, of, geographical, exploration, occurred, in, human, history, the, first, covering, most, of, human, history, saw, people, moving, out, of, africa, settling, in, new, lands, and, developing, distinct, cultures, in, relative, isolation, early, explorers, settled, in, europe, and, asia, about, 14, 000, years, ago, some, crossed, the, ice, age, land, bridge, from, siberia, to, alaska, and, moved, southwards, to, settle, in, the, americas, for, the, most, part, these, cultures, were, ignorant, of, each, other, s, existence, the, second, period, of, exploration, occurring, over, the, last, 10, 000, years, saw, increased, cross, cultural, exchange, through, trade, and, exploration, and, marked, a, new, era, of, cultural, intermingling, and, more, recently, convergence, early, writings, about, exploration, date, back, to, the, 4th, millennium, b, c, in, ancient, egypt, one, of, the, earliest, and, most, impactful, thinkers, on, exploration, was, ptolemy, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, between, the, 5th, century, and, 15th, century, ad, most, exploration, was, done, by, chinese, and, arab, explorers, this, was, followed, by, the, age, of, discovery, after, european, scholars, rediscovered, the, works, of, early, latin, and, greek, geographers, while, the, age, of, discovery, was, partly, driven, by, land, routes, outside, of, europe, becoming, unsafe, and, a, desire, for, conquest, the, 17th, century, also, saw, exploration, driven, by, nobler, motives, including, scientific, discovery, and, the, expansion, of, knowledge, about, the, world, this, broader, knowledge, of, the, world, s, geography, meant, that, people, were, able, to, make, world, maps, depicting, all, land, known, the, first, modern, atlas, was, the, theatrum, orbis, terrarum, published, by, abraham, ortelius, which, included, a, world, map, that, depicted, all, of, earth, s, continents, 32, underwater, exploration, is, the, exploration, of, any, underwater, environment, either, by, direct, observation, by, the, explorer, or, by, remote, observation, and, measurement, under, the, direction, of, the, investigators, systematic, targeted, exploration, with, simultaneous, survey, and, recording, of, data, followed, by, data, processing, interpretation, and, publication, is, the, most, effective, method, to, increase, understanding, of, the, ocean, and, other, underwater, regions, so, they, can, be, effectively, managed, conserved, regulated, and, their, resources, discovered, accessed, and, used, less, than, 10, of, the, ocean, has, been, mapped, in, any, detail, even, less, has, been, visually, observed, and, the, total, diversity, of, life, and, distribution, of, populations, is, similarly, incompletely, known, space, exploration, is, the, use, of, astronomy, and, space, technology, to, explore, outer, space, while, the, exploration, of, space, is, currently, carried, out, mainly, by, astronomers, with, telescopes, its, physical, exploration, is, conducted, both, by, uncrewed, robotic, space, probes, and, human, spaceflight, space, exploration, like, its, classical, form, astronomy, is, one, of, the, main, sources, for, space, science, while, the, observation, of, objects, in, space, known, as, astronomy, predates, reliable, recorded, history, it, was, the, development, of, large, and, relatively, efficient, rockets, during, the, mid, twentieth, century, that, allowed, physical, extraterrestrial, exploration, to, become, a, reality, common, rationales, for, exploring, space, include, advancing, scientific, research, national, prestige, uniting, different, nations, ensuring, the, future, survival, of, humanity, and, developing, military, and, strategic, advantages, against, other, countries, urban, exploration, is, the, exploration, of, manmade, structures, usually, abandoned, ruins, or, hidden, components, of, the, manmade, environment, photography, and, historical, interest, documentation, are, heavily, featured, in, the, hobby, sometimes, involving, trespassing, onto, private, property, the, activity, presents, various, risks, including, physical, danger, and, if, done, illegally, and, or, without, permission, the, possibility, of, arrest, and, punishment, some, activities, associated, with, urban, exploration, violate, local, or, regional, laws, and, certain, broadly, interpreted, anti, terrorism, laws, or, can, be, considered, trespassing, or, invasion, of, privacy, traditionally, mineral, exploration, relied, on, direct, observation, of, mineralisation, in, rock, outcrops, or, in, sediments, more, recently, however, mineral, exploration, also, includes, the, use, of, geologic, geophysical, and, geochemical, tools, to, search, for, anomalies, which, can, narrow, the, search, area, the, area, to, be, prospected, should, be, covered, sufficiently, to, minimize, the, risk, of, missing, something, important, but, it, can, take, into, account, previous, experience, that, certain, geological, evidence, correlates, with, a, very, low, probability, of, finding, the, desired, minerals, other, evidence, indicates, a, high, probability, making, it, efficient, to, concentrate, on, the, areas, of, high, probability, when, they, are, found, and, for, the, skipping, areas, of, very, low, probability, once, an, anomaly, has, been, identified, and, interpreted, to, be, a, prospect, more, detailed, exploration, of, the, potential, reserve, can, be, done, by, soil, sampling, drilling, seismic, surveys, and, similar, methods, to, assess, the, most, appropriate, method, and, type, of, mining, and, the, economic, potential, in, all, these, definitions, there, is, an, implication, of, novelty, or, unfamiliarity, or, the, expectation, of, discovery, in, the, exploration, whereas, a, survey, implies, directed, examination, but, not, necessarily, discovery, of, any, previously, unknown, or, unexpected, information, the, activities, are, not, mutually, exclusive, and, often, occur, simultaneously, to, a, variable, extent, the, same, field, of, investigation, or, region, may, be, explored, at, different, times, by, different, explorers, with, different, motivations, who, may, make, similar, or, different, discoveries, explorers, general, pre, renaissance, exploration, and, empire, the, continents, the, oceans, the, poles, space
