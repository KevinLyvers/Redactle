america, mexico, and, most, of, the, islands, of, the, caribbean, in, a, narrow, sense, it, refers, to, spanish, america, and, often, it, may, also, include, brazil, portuguese, america, the, term, latin, america, may, be, used, broader, than, hispanic, america, which, specifically, refers, to, spanish, speaking, countries, and, narrower, than, categories, such, as, ibero, america, a, term, that, refers, to, both, spanish, and, portuguese, speaking, countries, from, the, americas, and, sometimes, from, europe, it, could, also, theoretically, encompass, quebec, or, louisiana, where, french, is, still, spoken, and, are, historical, remnants, of, the, french, empire, in, that, region, of, the, globe, the, term, latin, america, was, first, used, in, paris, at, a, conference, in, 1856, called, initiative, of, america, idea, for, a, federal, congress, of, the, republics, iniciativa, de, la, am, rica, idea, de, un, congreso, federal, de, las, rep, blicas, by, the, chilean, politician, francisco, bilbao, the, term, was, further, popularized, by, french, emperor, napoleon, iii, s, government, of, political, strongman, that, in, the, 1860s, as, am, rique, latine, to, justify, france, s, military, involvement, in, the, second, mexican, empire, and, to, include, french, speaking, territories, in, the, americas, such, as, french, canada, haiti, french, louisiana,

trillion, research, has, shown, that, the, idea, that, a, part, of, the, americas, has, a, linguistic, and, cultural, affinity, with, the, romance, cultures, as, a, whole, can, be, traced, back, to, the, 1830s, in, the, writing, of, the, french, saint, simonian, michel, chevalier, who, postulated, that, a, part, of, the, americas, was, inhabited, by, people, of, a, latin, race, and, that, it, could, therefore, ally, itself, with, latin, europe, ultimately, overlapping, the, latin, church, in, a, struggle, with, teutonic, europe, and, anglo, saxon, america, with, its, anglo, saxonism, as, well, as, slavic, europe, with, its, pan, slavism, scholarship, has, political, origins, of, the, term, two, latin, american, historians, uruguayan, arturo, ardao, and, chilean, miguel, rojas, mix, found, evidence, that, the, term, latin, america, was, used, earlier, than, phelan, claimed, and, the, first, use, of, the, term, was, in, fact, in, opposition, to, imperialist, projects, in, the, americas, ardao, wrote, about, this, subject, in, his, book, g, nesis, de, la, idea, y, el, nombre, de, am, rica, latina, genesis, of, the, idea, and, the, name, of, latin, america, 1980, and, miguel, rojas, mix, in, his, article, bilbao, y, el, hallazgo, de, am, rica, latina, uni, n, continental, socialista, y, libertaria, bilbao, and, the, finding, of, latin, america, a, continental, socialist, and, libertarian, union, 1986, as, michel, gobat, points, out, in, his, article, the, invention, of, latin, america, a, transnational, history, of, anti, imperialism, democracy, and, race, arturo, ardao, miguel, rojas, mix, and, aims, mcguinness, have, revealed, the, term, latin, america, had, already, been, used, in, 1856, by, central, americans, and, south, americans, protesting, us, expansion, into, the, southern, hemisphere, edward, shawcross, summarizes, ardao, s, and, rojas, mix, s, findings, in, the, following, way, ardao, identified, the, term, in, a, poem, by, a, colombian, diplomat, and, intellectual, resident, in, france, jos, mar, a, torres, caicedo, published, on, 15, february, 1857, in, a, french, based, spanish, language, newspaper, while, rojas, mix, located, it, in, a, speech, delivered, in, france, by, the, radical, liberal, chilean, politician, francisco, bilbao, in, june, 1856, by, the, late, 1850s, the, term, was, being, used, in, california, which, had, become, a, part, of, the, united, states, in, local, newspapers, such, as, el, clamor, p, blico, by, californios, writing, about, am, rica, latina, and, latinoam, rica, and, identifying, as, latinos, as, the, abbreviated, term, for, their, hemispheric, membership, in, la, raza, latina, the, words, latin, and, america, were, first, found, to, be, combined, in, a, printed, work, to, produce, the, term, latin, america, in, 1856, at, a, conference, by, the, chilean, politician, francisco, bilbao, in, paris, the, conference, had, the, title, initiative, of, the, america, the, idea, for, a, federal, congress, of, republics, the, following, year, colombian, writer, jos, mar, a, torres, caicedo, also, used, the, term, in, his, poem, the, two, americas, two, events, related, with, the, united, states, played, a, central, role, in, both, works, the, first, event, happened, less, than, a, decade, before, the, publication, of, bilbao, s, and, torres, caicedo, s, works, the, invasion, of, mexico, or, in, the, us, the, mexican, american, war, after, which, the, united, states, annexed, more, than, half, of, mexico, s, territory, the, second, event, the, walker, affair, which, happened, the, same, year, that, both, works, were, written, the, decision, by, us, president, franklin, pierce, to, recognize, the, regime, recently, established, in, nicaragua, by, american, william, walker, and, his, band, of, filibusters, who, ruled, nicaragua, for, nearly, a, year, 1856, 57, and, attempted, to, reinstate, slavery, there, where, it, had, been, already, abolished, for, three, decades, in, both, bilbao, s, and, torres, caicedo, s, works, the, mexican, american, war, 1846, 48, and, william, walker, s, expedition, to, nicaragua, are, explicitly, mentioned, as, examples, of, dangers, for, the, region, for, bilbao, latin, america, was, not, a, geographical, concept, as, he, excluded, brazil, paraguay, and, mexico, both, authors, also, asked, for, the, union, of, all, latin, american, countries, as, the, only, way, to, defend, their, territories, against, further, foreign, us, interventions, both, also, rejected, european, imperialism, claiming, that, the, return, of, european, countries, to, non, democratic, forms, of, government, was, another, danger, for, latin, american, countries, and, used, the, same, word, to, describe, the, state, of, european, politics, at, the, time, despotism, several, years, later, during, the, french, invasion, of, mexico, bilbao, wrote, another, work, emancipation, of, the, spirit, in, america, where, he, asked, all, latin, american, countries, to, support, the, mexican, cause, against, france, and, rejected, french, imperialism, in, asia, africa, europe, and, the, americas, he, asked, latin, american, intellectuals, to, search, for, their, intellectual, emancipation, by, abandoning, all, french, ideas, claiming, that, france, was, hypocrite, because, she, calls, herself, protector, of, the, latin, race, just, to, subject, it, to, her, exploitation, regime, treacherous, because, she, speaks, of, freedom, and, nationality, when, unable, to, conquer, freedom, for, herself, she, enslaves, others, instead, therefore, as, michel, gobat, puts, it, the, term, latin, america, itself, had, an, anti, imperial, genesis, and, their, creators, were, far, from, supporting, any, form, of, imperialism, in, the, region, or, in, any, other, place, of, the, globe, the, distinction, between, latin, america, and, anglo, america, is, a, convention, based, on, the, predominant, languages, in, the, americas, by, which, romance, language, and, english, speaking, cultures, are, distinguished, neither, area, is, culturally, or, linguistically, homogeneous, in, substantial, portions, of, latin, america, e, g, highland, peru, bolivia, mexico, guatemala, native, american, cultures, and, to, a, lesser, extent, amerindian, languages, are, predominant, and, in, other, areas, the, influence, of, african, cultures, is, strong, e, g, the, caribbean, basin, including, parts, of, colombia, and, venezuela, the, term, s, meaning, is, contested, and, not, without, controversy, historian, mauricio, tenorio, trillo, explores, at, length, the, allure, and, power, of, the, idea, of, latin, america, he, remarks, at, the, outset, the, idea, of, latin, america, ought, to, have, vanished, with, the, obsolescence, of, racial, theory, but, it, is, not, easy, to, declare, something, dead, when, it, can, hardly, be, said, to, have, existed, going, on, to, say, the, term, is, here, to, stay, and, it, is, important, following, in, the, tradition, of, chilean, writer, francisco, bilbao, who, excluded, brazil, argentina, and, paraguay, from, his, early, conceptualization, of, latin, america, chilean, historian, jaime, eyzaguirre, has, criticized, the, term, latin, america, for, disguising, and, diluting, the, spanish, character, of, a, region, i, e, hispanic, america, with, the, inclusion, of, nations, that, according, to, him, do, not, share, the, same, pattern, of, conquest, and, colonization, the, francophone, part, of, north, america, which, includes, quebec, acadia, and, louisiana, is, generally, excluded, from, the, definition, of, latin, america, latin, america, can, be, subdivided, into, several, subregions, based, on, geography, politics, democracy, demographics, and, culture, the, basic, geographical, subregions, are, north, america, central, america, the, caribbean, and, south, america, the, latter, contains, further, politico, geographical, subdivisions, such, as, the, southern, cone, the, guianas, and, the, andean, states, it, may, be, subdivided, on, linguistic, grounds, into, spanish, america, portuguese, america, and, french, america, the, term, latin, america, is, defined, to, mean, parts, of, americas, south, of, the, mainland, of, the, united, states, of, america, where, a, romance, language, a, language, derived, from, latin, predominates, latin, america, are, the, countries, and, territories, in, the, americas, which, speak, spanish, or, portuguese, with, french, being, sometimes, included, as, is, customary, puerto, rico, is, included, and,

with, strong, presidential, regimes, such, as, brazil, wealth, inequality, in, latin, america, and, the, caribbean, remains, a, serious, issue, despite, strong, economic, growth, and, improved, social, indicators, a, report, released, in, 2013, by, the, un, department, of, economic, and, social, affairs, entitled, inequality, matters, report, of, the, world, social, situation, observed, that, declines, in, the, wage, share, have, been, attributed, to, the, impact, of, labour, saving, technological, change, and, to, a, general, weakening, of, labour, market, regulations, and, institutions, such, declines, are, likely, to, disproportionately, affect, individuals, in, the, middle, and, bottom, of, the, income, distribution, as, they, rely, mostly, on, wages, for, income, in, addition, the, report, noted, that, highly, unequal, land, distribution, has, created, social, and, political, tensions, and, is, a, source, of, economic, inefficiency, as, small, landholders, frequently, lack, access, to, credit, and, other, resources, to, increase, productivity, while, big, owners, may, not, have, had, enough, incentive, to, do, so, according, to, the, united, nations, eclac, latin, america, is, the, most, unequal, region, in, the, world, inequality, in, latin, america, has, deep, historical, roots, in, the, latin, european, racially, based, casta, system, instituted, in, latin, america, during, colonial, times, that, has, been, difficult, to, eradicate, because, of, the, differences, between, initial, endowments, and, opportunities, among, social, groups, have, constrained, the, poorest, s, social, mobility, thus, causing, poverty, to, transmit, from, generation, to, generation, and, become, a, vicious, cycle, inequality, has, been, reproduced, and, transmitted, through, generations, because, latin, american, political, systems, allow, a, differentiated, access, on, the, influence, that, social, groups, have, in, the, decision, making, process, and, it, responds, in, different, ways, to, the, least, favored, groups, that, have, less, political, representation, and, capacity, of, pressure, recent, economic, liberalisation, also, plays, a, role, as, not, everyone, is, equally, capable, of, taking, advantage, of, its, benefits, differences, in, opportunities, and, endowments, tend, to, be, based, on, race, ethnicity, rurality, and, gender, because, inequality, in, gender, and, location, are, near, universal, race, and, ethnicity, play, a, larger, more, integral, role, in, discriminatory, practices, in, latin, america, the, differences, have, a, strong, impact, on, the, distribution, of, income, capital, and, political, standing, one, indicator, of, inequality, is, access, to, and, quality, of, education, during, the, first, phase, of, globalization, in, latin, america, educational, inequality, was, on, the, rise, peaking, around, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, comparison, with, other, developing, regions, latin, america, then, had, the, highest, level, of, educational, inequality, which, is, certainly, a, contributing, factor, for, its, current, general, high, inequality, during, the, 20th, century,
