dynasty, conquered, the, area, in, 1666, and, united, most, of, morocco, under, his, rule, nonetheless, the, alawi, sultans, allowed, the, piracy, to, continue, up, until, the, reign, of, moulay, slimane, in, the, early, 19th, century, this, led, to, the, shelling, of, the, city, by, austria, in, 1829, after, an, austrian, ship, had, been, lost, to, a, pirate, attack, during, the, early, part, of, the, alawi, period, 17th, 18th, centuries, the, sultans, took, some, interest, in, the, city, of, the, south, bank, and, carried, out, constructions, and, repairs, to, the, kasbah, moulay, isma,

mosque, he, also, ordered, the, creation, of, a, jewish, quarter, the, mellah, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, andalusian, medina, in, an, formerly, occupied, by, orchards, it, was, also, towards, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, that, the, city, walls, formerly, limited, to, the, almohad, era, perimeter, were, extended, significantly, to, the, southwest, thus, expanding, the, city, to, cover, around, 840, hectares, the, old, almohad, walls, and, gates, were, still, retained, and, the, almohad, era, enclosure, remained, a, more, privileged, district, containing, the, city, s, major,

in, march, 1907, and, in, the, west, with, the, bombardment, of, casablanca, in, august, 1907, the, treaty, of, fes, established, the, protectorate, in, march, 1912, acting, as, french, administrator, of, morocco, lyautey, decided, to, relocate, the, country, s, capital, from, fes, to, rabat, after, the, riots, of, 1912, following, the, treaty, of, fes, lyautey, appears, to, have, had, a, personal, affinity, for, rabat, he, argued, that, its, coastal, location, was, more, pleasant, and, more, accessible, and, that, its, proximity, to, casablanca, which, he, estimated, would, become, the, major, economic, center, would, be, advantageous, 138, 139, in, 1913, lyautey, hired, henri, prost, to, design, the, ville, nouvelle, rabat, s, modern, quarter, as, an, administrative, sector, as, he, did, in, other, major, moroccan, cities, 145, 146, the, colonial, period, resulted, in, major, economic, changes, as, well, as, accelerated, urbanization, prior, to, this, period, the, major, cities, of,

1912, rabat, and, nearby, sal, can, be, estimated, to, have, had, about, 35, 000, to, 40, 000, inhabitants, at, most, according, to, janet, abu, lughod, 152, one, early, french, survey, based, on, the, number, of, houses, rather, than, a, formal, census, estimated, the, population, of, rabat, to, be, 25, 642, a, formal, census, in, 1921, counted, the, population, as, 33, 714, 152, 153, some, of, this, growth, was, due, to, the, immigration, of, foreigners, in, 1921, 59, of, the, population, were, moroccan, muslims, and, 10, were, moroccan, jews, while, 21, 4, were, french, nationals, and,

continued, unabated, the, most, important, demographic, shift, after, independence, was, the, exodus, of, foreign, nationals, and, their, replacement, by, moroccans, who, gradually, took, over, the, jobs, and, functions, that, the, foreigners, had, occupied, in, the, census, of, 1971, the, population, of, rabat, had, grown, to, around, 368, 000, of, which, only, 3, 5, were, foreigners, 152, 153,
