labelled, as, india, in, its, classical, and, pre, modern, sense, and, greater, india, according, to, robert, m, cutler, a, scholar, of, political, science, at, carleton, university, the, terms, south, asia, southwest, asia, and, central, asia, are, distinct, but, the, confusion, and, disagreements, have, arisen, due, to, the, geopolitical, movement, to, enlarge, these, regions, into, greater, south, asia, greater, southwest, asia, and, greater, central, asia, the, frontier, of, greater, south, asia, states, cutler, between, 2001, and, 2006, has, been, geopolitically, extended, to,

weakened, and, thus, decided, to, grant, independence, to, the, vast, majority, of, south, asians, in, 1947, though, this, coincided, with, the, partition, of, india, into, a, hindu, majority, india, and, a, muslim, majority, pakistan, which, resulted, in, significant, displacement, and, violence, and, harder, religious, divides, in, the, region, in, 1947, the, newly, independent, india, and, pakistan, had, to, decide, how, to, deal, with, the, hundreds, of, princely, states, that, controlled, much, of, the, subcontinent, as, well, as, what, to, do, with, the, remaining, european, non, british, colonies, a, combination, of, referendums, military, action, and, negotiated, accessions, took, place, in, rapid, succession, leading, to, the, political, integration, of, the, vast, majority, of, india, and, pakistan, within, a, few, years, india, and, pakistan, clashed, several, times, in, the, decades, after, independence, with, disputes, over, kashmir, playing, a, significant, role, in, 1971, the, eastern, half, of, pakistan, seceded, with, help, from, india, and, became, the, people, s, republic, of, bangladesh, after, the, traumatic, bangladesh, liberation, war, this, along, with, india, and, pakistan, gaining, nuclear, weapons, soon, afterwards, increased, tensions, between, the, two, countries, the, cold, war, decades, also, contributed, to, the, divide, as, pakistan, aligned, with, the, west, and, india, with, the, soviet, union, other, factors, include, the, time, period, after, the, 1962, sino, indian, war, which, saw, india, and, china, move, apart, while, pakistan, and, china, built, closer, relations, pakistan, has, been, beset, with, terrorism, economic, issues, and, military, dominance, of, its, government, since, independence, with, none, of, its, prime, ministers, having, completed, a, full, 5, year, term, in, office, india, has, grown, significantly, having, slashed, its, rate, of, extreme, poverty, to, below, 20, and, surpassed, pakistan, s, gdp, per, capita, in, the, 2010s, due, to, economic, liberalisation, from, the, 1980s, onward, bangladesh, having, struggled, greatly, for, decades, due, to, conflict, with, and,

invasions, and, islamist, regimes, with, many, of, its, refugees, having, gone, to, pakistan, and, other, parts, of, south, asia, and, bringing, back, cultural, influences, such, as, cricket, religious, nationalism, has, grown, across, the, region, with, persecution, causing, millions, of, hindus, and, christians, to, flee, pakistan, and, bangladesh, and, hindu, nationalism, having, grown, in, india, with, the, election, of, the, bharatiya, janata, party, in, 2014, a, recent, phenomenon, has, been, that, of, india, and, china, fighting, on, their, border, as, well, as, vying, for, dominance, of, south, asia, with, china, partnering, with, pakistan, and, using, its, superior, economy, to, attract, countries, surrounding, india, while, america, and, other, countries, have, strengthened, ties, with, india, to, counter, china, in, the, broader, indo, pacific, according, to, saul, cohen, early, colonial, era, strategists, treated, south, asia, with, east, asia, but, in, reality, the, south, asia, region, excluding, afghanistan, is, a, distinct, geopolitical, region, separated, from, other, nearby, geostrategic, realms, one, that, is, geographically, diverse, the, region, is, home, to, a, variety, of, geographical, features, such, as, glaciers, rainforests, valleys, deserts, and, grasslands, that, are, typical, of, much, larger, continents, it, is, surrounded, by, three, water, bodies, the, bay, of, bengal, the, indian, ocean, and, the, arabian, sea, and, has, acutely, varied, climate, zones, the, tip, of, the, indian, peninsula, had, the, highest, quality,

the, vast, range, of, contextual, difference, across, the, region, complicating, any, attempt, to, compare, between, countries, in, 2018, 11, 3, million, children, at, the, primary, level, and, 20, 6, million, children, at, the, lower, secondary, level, were, out, of, school, in, south, asia, while, millions, of, children, completed, primary, education, without, mastering, the, foundational, skills, of, basic, numeracy, and, literacy, according, to, unesco, 241, million, children, between, six, and, fourteen, years, or, 81, percent, of, the, total, were, not, learning, in, southern, and, central, asia, in, 2017, only, sub, saharan, africa, had, a, higher, rate, of, children, not, learning, two, thirds, of, these, children, were, in, school, sitting, in, classrooms, only, 19, of, children, attending, primary, and, lower, secondary, schools, attain, a, minimum, proficiency, level, in, reading, and, mathematics, according, to, a, citizen, led, assessment, only, 48, in, indian, public, schools, and, 46, of, children, in, pakistan, public, schools, could, read, a, class, two, level, text, by, the, time, they, reached, class, five, this, poor, quality, of, education, in, turn, has, contributed, to, some, of, the, highest, drop, out, rates, in, the, world, while, over, half, of, the, students, complete, secondary, school, with, acquiring, requisite, skills, in, south, asia, classrooms, are, teacher, centred, and, rote, based, while, children, are, often, subjected, to, corporal, punishment, and, discrimination, different, south, asian, countries, have, different, education, structures, while, by, 2018, india, and, pakistan, has, two, of, the, most, developed, and, increasingly, decentralised, education, systems, bangladesh, still, had, a, highly, centralised, system, and, nepal, is, in, a, state, of, transition, from, a, centralized, to, a, decentralized, system, in, most, south, asian, countries, children, s, education, is, theoretically, free, the, exceptions, are, the, maldives, where, there, is, no, constitutionally, guaranteed, free, education, as, well, as, bhutan, and, nepal, where, fees, are, charged, by, primary, schools, but, parents, are, still, faced, with, unmanageable, secondary, financial, demands, including, private, tuition, to, make, up, for, the, inadequacies, of, the, education, system, the, larger, and, poorer, countries, in, the, region, like, india, and, bangladesh, struggle, financially, to, get, sufficient, resources, to, sustain, an, education, system, required, for, their, vast, populations, with, an, added, challenge, of, getting, large, numbers, of, out, of, school, children, enrolled, into, schools, their, capacity, to, deliver, inclusive, and, equitable, quality, education, is, limited, by, low, levels, of, public, finance, for, education, while, the, smaller, emerging, middle, income, countries, like, sri, lanka, maldives, and, bhutan, have, been, able, to, achieve, universal, primary, school, completion, and, are, in, a, better, position, to, focus, on, quality, of, education, children, s, education, in, the, region, is, also, adversely, affected, by, natural, and, human, made, crises, including, natural, hazards, political, instability, rising, extremism, and, civil, strife, that, makes, it, difficult, to, deliver, educational, services, afghanistan, and, india, are, among, the, top, ten, countries, with, the, highest, number, of, reported, disasters, due, to, natural, hazards, and, conflict, the, precarious, security, situation, in, afghanistan, is, a, big, barrier, in,
