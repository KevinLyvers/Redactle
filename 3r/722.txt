eastern, europe, is, a, subregion, of, the, european, continent, as, a, largely, ambiguous, term, it, has, a, wide, range, of, geopolitical, geographical, ethnic, cultural, and, socio, economic, connotations, its, eastern, boundary, is, marked, by, the, ural, mountains, whilst, its, western, boundary, is, defined, in, various, ways, most, definitions, include, the, countries, of, belarus, russia, ukraine, moldova, and, romania, while, less, restrictive, definitions, may, also, include, some, or, all, of, the, balkans, the, baltic, states, the, caucasus, and, the, visegr, d, group, the, region, represents, a, significant, part, of, european, culture, the, main, socio, cultural, characteristics, of, eastern, europe, have, historically, been, defined, by, the, traditions, of, the, east, slavs, and, greeks, as, well, as, by, the, influence, of, eastern, christianity, as, it, developed, through, the, eastern, roman, empire, and, the, ottoman, empire, another, definition, was, created, by, the, cold, war, as, europe, was, ideologically, divided, by, the, iron, curtain, with, eastern, europe, being, synonymous, with, communist, states, constituting, the, eastern, bloc, under, the, influence, of, the, soviet, union, the, term, is, sometimes, considered, to, be, pejorative, through, stereotypes, about, eastern, europe, being, inferior, poorer, less, developed, to, western, europe, the, term, central, and, eastern, europe, is, sometimes, used, for, a, more, neutral, grouping, several, definitions, of, eastern, europe, exist, in, the, early, 21st, century, but, they, often, lack, precision, and, may, be, anachronistic, these, definitions, are, debated, across, cultures, and, among, experts, even, political, scientists, as, the, term, has, a, wide, range, of, geopolitical, geographical, cultural, and, socioeconomic, connotations, it, has, also, been, described, as, a, fuzzy, term, as, the, idea, itself, of, eastern, europe, is, in, constant, redefinition, the, solidification, of, the, idea, of, an, eastern, europe, dates, back, chiefly, to, the, french, enlightenment, there, are, almost, as, many, definitions, of, eastern, europe, as, there, are, scholars, of, the, region, a, related, united, nations, paper, adds, that, every, assessment, of, spatial, identities, is, essentially, a, social, and, cultural, construct, while, the, eastern, geographical, boundaries, of, europe, are, well, defined, the, boundary, between, eastern, and, western, europe, is, not, geographical, but, historical, religious, and, cultural, and, is, harder, to, designate, the, ural, mountains, ural, river, and, the, caucasus, mountains, are, the, geographical, land, border, of, the, eastern, edge, of, europe, e, g, kazakhstan, which, is, mainly, located, in, central, asia, with, the, most, western, parts, of, it, located, west, of, the, ural, river, also, shares, a, part, of, eastern, europe, in, the, west, however, the, historical, and, cultural, boundaries, of, eastern, europe, are, subject, to, some, overlap, and, most, importantly, have, undergone, historical, fluctuations, which, makes, a, precise, definition, of, the, western, geographic, boundaries, of, eastern, europe, and, the, geographical, midpoint, of, europe, somewhat, difficult, after, the, east, west, schism, of, 1054, significant, parts, of, eastern, europe, developed, cultural, unity, and, resistance, to, catholic, western, and, central, europe, within, the, framework, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, church, slavonic, language, and, the, cyrillic, alphabet, the, earliest, concept, of, europe, as, a, cultural, sphere, instead, of, simply, a, geographic, term, was, formed, by, alcuin, of, york, during, the, carolingian, renaissance, of, the, 9th, century, limited, to, the, territories, that, practised, western, christianity, at, the, time, european, as, a, cultural, term, did, not, include, much, of, the, territories, where, the, orthodox, church, represented, the, dominant, religion, until, the, 19th, century, a, large, section, of, eastern, europe, is, formed, by, countries, with, dominant, orthodox, churches, like, belarus, bulgaria, cyprus, georgia, greece, moldova, montenegro, north, macedonia, romania, russia, serbia, and, ukraine, for, instance, as, well, as, armenia, which, is, predominantly, armenian, apostolic, the, eastern, orthodox, church, has, played, a, prominent, role, in, the, history, and, culture, of, eastern, and, southeastern, europe, to, a, lesser, degree, forms, of, eastern, protestantism, and, eastern, catholicism, have, also, been, influential, in, eastern, europe, countries, where, eastern, protestantism, or, eastern, catholicism, hold, historical, significance, include, belarus, croatia, greece, hungary, lithuania, poland, romania, russia, slovakia, slovenia, and, ukraine, the, schism, refers, to, the, historical, break, of, communion, and, theology, between, the, eastern, orthodox, and, western, catholic, churches, later, developments, meant, that, the, divide, was, no, longer, solely, between, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, from, the, 16th, century, both, western, and, eastern, forms, of, protestantism, began, to, emerge, in, europe, additionally, eastern, catholic, churches, began, to, spread, in, europe, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, following, the, establishment, of, the, ukrainian, greek, catholic, church, in, 1596, however, the, concept, of, eastern, catholicism, itself, predates, this, since, the, great, schism, of, 1054, europe, has, been, divided, between, catholic, and, later, additionally, protestant, churches, in, the, west, and, the, eastern, orthodox, christian, often, incorrectly, labelled, greek, orthodox, churches, in, the, east, due, to, this, religious, cleavage, eastern, orthodox, countries, are, often, associated, with, eastern, europe, a, cleavage, of, this, sort, is, however, often, problematic, for, example, greece, is, overwhelmingly, orthodox, but, is, very, rarely, included, in, eastern, europe, for, a, variety, of, reasons, the, most, prominent, being, that, greece, s, history, for, the, most, part, was, more, influenced, by, mediterranean, cultures, and, dynamics, the, fall, of, the, iron, curtain, brought, the, end, of, the, cold, war, east, west, division, in, europe, but, this, geopolitical, concept, is, sometimes, still, used, for, quick, reference, by, the, media, another, definition, was, used, during, the, 40, years, of, cold, war, between, 1947, and, 1989, and, was, more, or, less, synonymous, with, the, terms, eastern, bloc, and, warsaw, pact, a, similar, definition, names, the, formerly, communist, european, states, outside, the, soviet, union, as, eastern, europe, historians, and, social, scientists, generally, view, such, definitions, as, outdated, or, relegated, many, former, communist, states, in, this, region, although, their, formal, alliances, were, severed, by, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, continued, to, feel, a, moral, duty, to, support, states, that, have, not, been, liberated, from, the, tyranny, of, capitalism, this, shared, duty, collapsed, when, most, of, the, former, soviet, satellites, abandoned, socialism, and, adopted, capitalism, eurovoc, a, multilingual, thesaurus, maintained, by, the, publications, office, of, the, european, union, classifies, bulgaria, croatia, czechia, hungary, poland, romania, slovakia, and, slovenia, plus, the, candidate, countries, albania, north, macedonia, and, serbia, as, central, and, eastern, european,

armenia, and, georgia, may, enter, the, eu, in, the, future, however, georgia, is, currently, the, only, south, caucasus, nation, actively, seeking, nato, and, eu, membership, there, are, two, de,

and, rights, of, nations, former, republics, with, limited, recognition, some, european, republics, of, the, former, soviet, union, are, considered, a, part, of, eastern, europe, unrecognized, states, the, term, central, europe, is, often, used, by, historians, to, designate, states, formerly, belonging, to, the, holy, roman, empire, the, habsburg, empire, and, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, in, some, media, central, europe, can, thus, partially, overlap, with, eastern, europe, of, the, cold, war, era, the, following, countries, are, labelled, central, european, by, some, commentators, though, others, still, consider, them, to, be, eastern, european, some, countries, in, southeast, europe, can, be, considered, part, of, eastern, europe, some, of, them, can, sometimes, albeit, rarely, be, characterized, as, belonging, to, southern, europe, and, some, may, also, be, included, in, central, europe, in, some, media, southeast, europe, can, thus, partially, overlap, with, eastern, europe, of, the, cold, war, era, the, following, countries, are, labelled, southeast, european, by, some, commentators, though, others, still, consider, them, to, be, eastern, european, partially, recognized, states, despite, being, frequently, classified, as, a, central, asian, country, about, 4, of, kazakhstan, s, territory, situated, west, of, the, ural, river, geographically, lies, in, eastern, europe, thus, technically, making, it, a, transcontinental, country, ancient, kingdoms, of, the, region, included, orontid, armenia, caucasian, albania, colchis, and, iberia, not, to, be, confused, with, the, iberian, peninsula, in, western, europe, of, which, the, former, two, were, the, predecessor, states, of, armenia, and, azerbaijan, respectively, while, the, latter, two, were, the, predecessor, states, of, modern, day, georgia, these, peripheral, kingdoms, were, either, from, the, start, or, later, on, incorporated, into, various, iranian, empires, including, the, achaemenid, persian, parthian, and, sassanid, persian, empires, parts, of, the, balkans, and, some, more, northern, areas, were, ruled, by, the, achaemenid, persians, as, well, including, thrace, paeonia, macedon, and, most, of, the, black, sea, coastal, regions, of, romania, ukraine, and, russia, owing, to, the, rivalry, between, the, parthian, empire, and, rome, and, later, between, byzantium, and, the, sassanid, persians, the, parthians, would, invade, the, region, several, times, although, it, was, never, able, to, hold, the, area, unlike, the, sassanids, who, controlled, most, of, the, caucasus, during, their, entire, rule, the, earliest, known, distinctions, between, east, and, west, in, europe, originate, in, the, history, of, the, roman, republic, as, the, roman, domain, expanded, a, cultural, and, linguistic, division, appeared, the, mainly, greek, speaking, eastern, provinces, had, formed, the, highly, urbanized, hellenistic, civilization, in, contrast, the, western, territories, largely, adopted, the, latin, language, this, cultural, and, linguistic, division, was, eventually, reinforced, by, the, later, political, east, west, division, of, the, roman, empire, the, division, between, these, two, spheres, deepened, during, late, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, due, to, a, number, of, events, the, western, roman, empire, collapsed, in, the, 5th, century, marking, the, start, of, the, early, middle, ages, by, contrast, the, eastern, roman, empire, the, byzantine, empire, had, a, survival, strategy, that, kept, it, alive, for, another, 1, 000, years, the, rise, of, the, frankish, empire, in, the, west, and, in, particular, the, great, schism, that, formally, divided, eastern, and, western, christianity, in, 1054, heightened, the, cultural, and, religious, distinctiveness, between, eastern, and, western, europe, much, of, eastern, europe, was, invaded, and, occupied, by, the, mongols, during, the, ostsiedlung, towns, founded, under, magdeburg, rights, became, centers, of, economic, development, and, scattered, german, settlements, were, founded, in, parts, of, eastern, europe, introduction, of, german, town, law, is, often, seen, as, a, second, great, step, after, introduction, of, christianity, at, the, turn, of, the, first, and, second, millennia, the, ensuing, modernization, of, society, and, economy, allowed, the, increased, role, played, by, the, rulers, of, bohemia, and, poland, the, conquest, of, the, byzantine, empire, center, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, by, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, 15th, century, and, the, gradual, fragmentation, of, the, holy, roman, empire, which, had, replaced, the, frankish, empire, led, to, a, change, of, the, importance, of, catholic, protestant, vs, eastern, orthodox, concept, in, europe, armour, points, out, that, cyrillic, alphabet, use, is, not, a, strict, determinant, for, eastern, europe, where, from, croatia, to, poland, and, everywhere, in, between, the, latin, alphabet, is, used, greece, s, status, as, the, cradle, of, western, civilization, and, an, integral, part, of, the, western, world, in, the, political, cultural, and, economic, spheres, has, led, to, it, being, nearly, always, classified, as, belonging, not, to, eastern, but, southern, or, western, europe, during, the, late, sixteenth, and, early, seventeenth, centuries, eastern, europe, enjoyed, a, relatively, high, standard, of, living, this, period, is, also, called, the, east, central, european, golden, age, of, around, 1600, at, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, numeracy, levels, in, eastern, europe, were, relatively, low, although, regional, differences, existed, during, the, 18th, century, the, regions, began, to, catch, up, with, western, europe, but, did, not, develop, as, rapidly, areas, with, stronger, female, autonomy, developed, more, quickly, in, terms, of, numeracy, serfdom, was, a, prevalent, status, of, agricultural, workers, until, the, 19th, century, it, resembled, slavery, in, terms, of, lack, of, freedom, with, the, distinction, that, the, landowners, could, not, buy, and, sell, serfs, separately, from, the, specific, plots, of, land, that, they, were, permanently, attached, to, the, system, emerged, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, century, the, same, time, it, was, declining, in, western, europe, the, climax, came, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, the, early, 19th, century, saw, its, decline, marked, especially, by, the, abolition, of, serfdom, in, russia, in, 1861, emancipation, meant, that, the, ex, serfs, paid, for, their, freedom, with, annual, cash, payments, to, their, former, masters, for, decades, the, system, varied, widely, country, by, country, and, was, not, as, standardized, as, in, western, europe, historians, until, the, 20th, century, focused, on, master, serf, economic, and, labor, relations, portraying, the, serfs, as, slave, like, passive, and, isolated, 20th, century, scholars, downplayed, the, evils, and, emphasize, the, complexities, before, 1870, the, industrialization, that, had, started, to, develop, in, northwestern, and, central, europe, and, the, united, states, did, not, extend, in, any, significant, way, to, the, rest, of, the, world, even, in, eastern, europe, industrialization, lagged, far, behind, russia, for, example, remained, largely, rural, and, agricultural, and, its, autocratic, rulers, kept, the, peasants, in, serfdom, a, major, result, of, the, first, world, war, was, the, breakup, of, the, russian, austro, hungarian, and, ottoman, empires, as, well, as, partial, losses, to, the, german, empire, a, surge, of, ethnic, nationalism, created, a, series, of, new, states, in, eastern, europe, validated, by, the, versailles, treaty, of, 1919, poland, was, reconstituted, after, the, partitions, of, the, 1790s, had, divided, it, between, germany, austria, and, russia, new, countries, included, finland, estonia, latvia, lithuania, ukraine, which, was, soon, absorbed, by, the, soviet, union, czechoslovakia, and, yugoslavia, austria, and, hungary, had, much, reduced, boundaries, the, new, states, included, sizeable, ethnic, minorities, which, were, to, be, protected, according, to, the, league, of, nations, minority, protection, regime, throughout, eastern, europe, ethnic, germans, constituted, by, far, the, largest, single, ethnic, minority, in, some, areas, as, in, the, sudetenland, regions, of, poland, and, in, parts, of, slovenia, german, speakers, constituted, the, local, majority, creating, upheaval, regarding, demands, of, self, determination, romania, bulgaria, and, albania, likewise, were, independent, many, of, the, countries, were, still, largely, rural, with, little, industry, and, only, a, few, urban, centres, nationalism, was, the, dominant, force, but, most, of, the, countries, had, ethnic, or, religious, minorities, who, felt, threatened, by, majority, elements, nearly, all, became, democratic, in, the, 1920s, but, all, of, them, except, czechoslovakia, and, finland, gave, up, democracy, during, the, depression, years, of, the, 1930s, in, favor, of, autocratic, strong, man, or, single, party, states, the, new, states, were, unable, to, form, stable, military, alliances, and, one, by, one, were, too, weak, to, stand, up, against, nazi, germany, or, the, soviet, union, which, took, them, over, between, 1938, and, 1945, russia, ended, its, participation, in, the, first, world, war, in, march, 1918, and, lost, territory, as, the, baltic, countries, and, poland, became, independent, the,

nazis, in, the, generalplan, ost, and, millions, of, others, killed, by, disease, starvation, and, military, action, or, executed, after, being, deemed, as, politically, dangerous, during, the, final, stages, of, world, war, ii, the, future, of, eastern, europe, was, decided, by, the, overwhelming, power, of, the, soviet, red, army, as, it, swept, the, germans, aside, it, did, not, reach, yugoslavia, and, albania, however, finland, was, free, but, forced, to, be, neutral, in, the, upcoming, cold, war, throughout, eastern, europe, german, speaking, populations, were, expelled, to, the, reduced, borders, of, germany, in, one, of, the, largest, ethnic, cleansing, operations, in, history, regions, where, germans, had, formed, the, local, population, majority, were, re, settled, with, polish, or, czech, speakers, the, region, fell, to, soviet, control, and, communist, governments, were, imposed, yugoslavia, albania, and, later, romania, had, their, own, communist, regimes, independent, of, moscow, the, eastern, bloc, at, the, onset, of, the, cold, war, in, 1947, was, far, behind, the, western, european, countries, in, economic, rebuilding, and, economic, progress, winston, churchill, in, his, well, known, sinews, of, peace, address, of, 5, march, 1946, at, westminster, college, in, fulton, missouri, stressed, the, geopolitical, impact, of, the, iron, curtain,

the, countries, in, eastern, europe, adopted, communist, modes, of, control, by, 1948, these, countries, were, officially, independent, of, the, soviet, union, but, the, practical, extent, of, this, independence, was, quite, limited, yugoslavia, and, albania, had, communist, control, that, was, independent, of, the, kremlin, the, communists, had, a, natural, reservoir, of, popularity, in, that,

for, mutual, economic, assistance, when, nato, was, created, in, 1949, most, countries, of, eastern, europe, became, members, of, the, opposing, warsaw, pact, forming, a, geopolitical, concept, that, became, known, as, the, eastern, bloc, this, consisted, of, with, the, fall, of, the, iron, curtain, in, 1989, the, political, landscape, of, the, eastern, bloc, and, indeed, the, world, changed, in,
