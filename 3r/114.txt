called, the, highest, navigable, lake, in, the, world, titicaca, is, the, largest, lake, in, south, america, both, in, terms, of, the, volume, of, water, and, surface, area, it, has, a, surface, elevation, of, 3, 812, m, 12, 507, ft, the, lake, is, located, at, the, northern, end, of, the, endorheic, altiplano, basin, high, in, the, andes, on, the, border, of, peru, and, bolivia, the, western, part, of, the, lake, lies, within, the, puno, region, of, peru, and, the, eastern, side, is, located, in, the, bolivian, la, paz, department, the, lake, consists, of, two, nearly, separate, subbasins, connected, by, the, strait, of, tiquina, which, is, 800, m, 2, 620, ft, across, at, the, narrowest, point, the, larger, subbasin, lago, grande, also, called, lago, chucuito, has, a, mean, depth, of, 135, m, 443, ft, and, a, maximum, depth, of, 284, m, 932, ft, the, smaller, subbasin, wi, aymarka, also, called, lago, peque, o, little, lake, has, an, average, depth, of, 9, m, 30, ft, and, a, maximum, depth, of, 40, m, 131, ft, the, overall, average, depth, of, the, lake, is, 107, m, 351, ft, five, major, river, systems, feed, into, lake, titicaca, in, order, of, their, relative, flow, volumes, these, are, ramis, coata, ilave, huancan, and, suchez, more, than, 20, other, smaller, streams, empty, into, titicaca, the, lake, has, 41, islands, some, of, which, are, densely, populated, having, only, a, single, season, of, free, circulation, the, lake, is, monomictic, and, water, passes, through, lago, hui, aimarca, and, flows, out, the, single, outlet, at, the, r, o, desaguadero, which, then, flows, south, through, bolivia, to, lake, poop, this, only, accounts, for, about, 10, of, the, lake, s, water, balance, evapotranspiration, caused, by, strong, winds, and, intense, sunlight, at, high, altitude, balances, the, remaining, 90, of, the, water, loss, it, is, nearly, a, closed, lake, since, 2000, lake, titicaca, has, experienced, constantly, receding, water, levels, between, april, and, november, 2009, alone, the, water, level, dropped, by, 81, cm, 32, in, reaching, the, lowest, level, since, 1949, this, drop, is, caused, by, shortened, rainy, seasons, and, the, melting, of, glaciers, feeding, the, tributaries, of, the, lake, water, pollution, is, also, an, increasing, concern, because, cities, in, the, titicaca, watershed, grow, sometimes, outpacing, solid, waste, and, sewage, treatment, infrastructure, according, to, the, global, nature, fund, gnf, titicaca, s, biodiversity, is, threatened, by, water, pollution, and, the, introduction, of, new, species, by, humans, a, 2011, united, nations, report, found, alarming, concentrations, of, cadmium, arsenic, and, lead, in, various, parts, of, the, lake, in, 2012, the, gnf, nominated, the, lake, threatened, lake, of, the, year, given, the, various, indigenous, groups, that, occupied, the, lake, titicaca, region, it, likely, lacked, a, single, commonly, accepted, name, in, prehistoric, times, and, at, the, time, the, spaniards, arrived, the, terms, titi, and, caca, can, be, translated, in, several, ways, in, aymara, titi, can, be, translated, as, either, puma, lead, or, a, heavy, metal, the, word, caca, kaka, can, be, translated, as, white, or, grey, hairs, of, the, head, and, the, term, k, ak, a, can, be, translated, as, either, crack, or, fissure, or, alternatively, comb, of, a, bird, according, to, weston, la, barre, the, aymara, considered, in, 1948, that, the, proper, name, of, the, lake, is, titiq, aq, a, which, means, gray, discolored, lead, colored, puma, this, phrase, refers, to, the, sacred, carved, rock, found, on, the, isla, del, sol, in, addition, to, names, including, the, term, titi, and, or, caca, lake, titicaca, was, also, known, as, chuquivitu, in, the, 16th, century, this, name, can, be, loosely, translated, as, lance, point, this, name, survives, in, modern, usage, in, which, the, large, lake, is, occasionally, referred, to, as, lago, chucuito, stanish, argues, that, the, logical, explanation, for, the, origin, of, the, name, titicaca, is, a, corruption, of, the, term, thakhsi, cala, which, is, the, 15th, to, the, 16th, century, name, of, the, sacred, rock, on, the, isla, del, sol, given, the, lack, of, a, common, name, for, lake, titicaca, in, the, 16th, century, the, spaniards, are, thought, to, have, used, the, name, of, the, site, of, the, most, important, indigenous, shrine, in, the, region, thakhsi, cala, on, the, isla, del, sol, as, the, name, for, the, lake, in, time, and, with, usage, this, name, developed, into, titicaca, locally, the, lake, goes, by, several, names, the, southeast, quarter, of, the, lake, is, separate, from, the, main, body, connected, only, by, the, strait, of, tiquina, and, the, bolivians, call, it, lago, hui, aymarca, also, wi, ay, marka, which, in, aymara, means, the, eternal, city, and, the, larger, part, lago, chucuito, the, large, lake, also, is, occasionally, referred, to, as, lago, mayor, and, the, small, lake, as, lago, menor, in, peru, these, smaller, and, larger, parts, are, referred, to, as, lago, peque, o, and, lago, grande, respectively, with, a, surface, area, of, 8, 372, km, 2, 3, 232, sq, mi, and, an, elevation, of, 3, 812, m, 12, 507, ft, lake, titicaca, is, often, called, the, highest, navigable, lake, in, the, world, that, claim, is, generally, considered, to, refer, to, commercial, craft, numerous, smaller, lakes, around, the, world, are, at, higher, elevations, such, as, the, 6, 000, square, metres, 65, 000, sq, ft, crater, lake, of, ojos, del, salado, which, at, an, elevation, of, 6, 480, 6, 500, metres, 21, 260, 21, 330, ft, is, the, overall, highest, lake, in, the, world, and, the, 280, km, 2, 110, sq, mi, lake, puma, yumco, which, at, an, elevation, of, 5, 030, m, 16, 500, ft, is, the, highest, large, lake, in, the, world, for, many, years, the, largest, vessel, afloat, on, lake, titicaca, was, the, 2, 200, ton, 2, 425, u, s,

between, 10, and, 11, c, 50, and, 52, f, lake, titicaca, is, home, to, more, than, 530, aquatic, species, the, lake, holds, large, populations, of, water, birds, and, was, designated, as, a, ramsar, site, on, august, 26, 1998, several, threatened, species, such, as, the, huge, titicaca, water, frog, and, the, flightless, titicaca, grebe, are, largely, or, entirely, restricted, to, the, lake, and, the, titicaca, orestias, has, likely, become, extinct, last, seen, in, 1938, due, to, competition, and, predation, by, the, introduced, rainbow, trout, and, the, silverside, odontesthes, bonariensis, in, addition, to, the, titicaca, orestias, native, fish, species, in, the, lake, s, basin, are, other, species, of, orestias, and, the, catfish, trichomycterus, dispar, t, rivulatus, and, astroblepus, stuebeli, the, last, species, not, in, the, lake, itself, but, in, associated, ecosystems, the, many, orestias, species, in, lake, titicaca, differ, significantly, in, both, habitat, preference, and, feeding, behavior, about, 90, of, the, fish, species, in, the, basin, are, endemic, including, 23, species, of, orestias, that, only, are, found, in, the, lake, in, addition, to, the, threatened, titicaca, grebe, some, of, the, birds, associated, with, water, at, titicaca, are, the, white, tufted, grebe, puna, ibis, chilean, flamingo, andean, gull, andean, lapwing, white, backed, stilt,

family, sphaeriidae, but, in, general, these, are, very, poorly, known, and, their, taxonomy, is, in, need, of, a, review, the, lake, also, has, an, endemic, species, flock, of, amphipods, consisting, of, 11, hyalella, an, additional, titicaca, hyalella, species, is, nonendemic, reeds, and, other, aquatic, vegetation, are, widespread, in, lake, titicaca, totora, sedges, grow, in, water, shallower, than, 3, m, 10, ft, less, frequently, to, 5, 5, m, 18, ft, but, macrophytes, notably, chara, and, potamogeton, occur, down, to, 10, m, 33, ft, in, sheltered, shallow, waters, such, as, the, harbour, of, puno, azolla, elodea, lemna, and, myriophyllum, are, common, the, tinajani, basin, in, which, lake, titicaca, lies, is, an, intermontane, basin, this, basin, is, a, pull, apart, basin, created, by, strike, slip, movement, along, regional, faults, starting, in, the, late, oligocene, and, ending, in, the, late, miocene, the, initial, development, of, the, tinajani, basin, is, indicated, by, volcanic, rocks, which, accumulated, between, 27, and, 20, million, years, ago, within, this, basin, they, lie, upon, an, angular, unconformity, which, cuts, across, pre, basin, strata, lacustrine, sediments, of, the, lower, tinajani, formation, which, are, exposed, within, the, tinajani, basin, demonstrate, the, presence, of, a, pre, quaternary, ancestral, lake, titicaca, within, it, between, 18, and, 14, million, years, ago, mya, little, is, known, about, the, prehistory, of, lake, titicaca, between, 14, mya, and, 370, 000, bp, because, the, lake, sediments, dating, to, this, period, lie, buried, beneath, the, bottom, of, lake, titicaca, and, have, not, yet, been, sampled, by, continuous, coring, the, lake, titicaca, drilling, project, recovered, a, 136, m, long, drill, core, of, sediments, from, the, bottom, of, lake, titicaca, at, a, depth, of, 235, m, 771, ft, and, at, a, location, just, east, of, isla, del, sol, this, core, contains, a, continuous, record, of, lake, sedimentation, and, paleoenvironmental, conditions, for, lake, titicaca, back, to, about, 370, 000, bp, for, this, period, of, time, lake, titicaca, was, typically, fresher, and, had, higher, lake, levels, during, periods, of, expanded, regional, glaciation, that, corresponded, to, global, glacial, periods, during, periods, of, reduced, regional, glaciation, that, corresponded, to, global, interglacial, periods, lake, titicaca, had, typically, low, lake, levels, lacustrine, sediments, and, associated, terraces, provide, evidence, for, the, past, existence, of, five, major, prehistoric, lakes, that, occupied, the, tinajani, basin, during, the, pliocene, and, pleistocene, within, the, northern, altiplano, tinajani, basin, these, prehistoric, lakes, were, lake, mataro, at, an, elevation, of, 3, 950, m, 12, 960, ft, lake, cabana, at, an, elevation, of, 3, 900, m, 12, 800, ft, lake, ballivi, n, at, an, elevation, of, 3, 860, m, 12, 660, ft, lake, north, minchin, at, an,

lake, cabana, possibly, dates, to, the, middle, pleistocene, lake, ballivi, n, existed, between, 120, 000, and, 98, 000, bp, two, high, lake, stands, between, 72, 000, and, 68, 000, bp, and, 44, 000, 34, 000, bp, have, been, discerned, for, lake, minchin, within, the, altiplano, another, ancient, lake, in, the, area, is, ouki, the, high, lake, levels, of, lake, tauca, have, been, dated, as, having, occurred, between, 18, 100, and, 14, 100, bp, underwater, excavations, and, surveys, in, and, around, khoa, reef, near, the, island, of, khoa, have, recovered, thousands, of, artifacts, these, artifacts, consist, of, ceramic, feline, incense, burners, carved, juvenile, llamas, and, well, crafted, metal, shell, and, stone, ornaments, during, the, fifteenth, and, sixteenth, centuries, lake, titicaca, was, a, mythical, place, and, the, location, of, a, pilgrimage, complex, for, the, incas, part, of, this, complex, included, khoa, reef, as, a, location, where, offerings, were, dropped,

where, they, were, oppressed, by, the, local, population, and, were, unable, to, secure, land, of, their, own, they, built, the, sedge, islands, which, could, be, moved, into, deep, water, or, to, different, parts, of, the, lake, as, necessary, for, greater, safety, from, their, hostile, neighbors, on, land, golden, in, color, many, of, the, islands, measure, about, 15, by, 15, m, 50, by, 50,

some, of, the, islands, have, watchtowers, and, other, buildings, also, constructed, of, sedges, historically, most, of, the, uros, islands, were, located, near, the, middle, of, the, lake, about, 14, km, 9, mi, from, the, shore, however, in, 1986, after, a, major, storm, devastated, the, islands, many, uros, rebuilt, closer, to, shore, as, of, 2011, about, 1, 200, uros, lived, on, an, archipelago, of, 60, artificial, islands, clustering, in, the, western, corner, of, the, lake, near, puno, titicaca, s, major, peruvian, port, town, the, islands, have, become, one, of, peru, s, tourist,
