https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown
downtown, is, a, term, primarily, used, in, the, usa, by, english, speakers, to, refer, to, a, city, s, sometimes, commercial, cultural, and, often, the, historical, political, and, geographic, heart, it, is, often, synonymous, with, its, central, business, district, cbd, downtowns, typically, contain, a, small, percentage, of, a, city, s, employment, sometimes, smaller, downtowns, are, surrounded, by, lower, population, densities, and, lower, incomes, than, suburbs, it, is, often, distinguished, as, a, hub, of, public, transit, and, culture, the, oxford, english, dictionary, s, first, citation, for, down, town, or, downtown, dates, to, 1770, in, reference, to, the, center, of, boston, some, have, posited, that, the, term, downtown, was, coined, in, new, york, city, where, it, was, in, use, by, the, 1830s, to, refer, to, the, original, settlement, or, town, at, the, southern, tip, of, the, island, of, manhattan, as, the, town, of, new, york, grew, into, a, city, the, only, direction, it, could, grow, on, the, island, was, toward, the, north, proceeding, upriver, from, the, original, settlement, the, up, and, down, terminology, coming, from, the, customary, map, design, in, which, up, was, north, and, down, was, south, thus, anything, north, of, the, original, town, became, known, as, uptown, upper, manhattan, and, was, generally, a, residential, area, while, the, original, town, which, was, also, new, york, s, only, major, center, of, business, at, the, time, became, known, as, downtown, lower, manhattan, during, the, late, 19th, century, the, term, was, gradually, adopted, by, cities, across, the, united, states, to, refer, to, the, historical, core, of, the, city, which, was, most, often, the, same, as, the, commercial, heart, of, the, city, uptown, also, spread, but, to, a, much, lesser, extent, in, both, cases, though, the, directionality, of, both, words, was, lost, so, that, a, bostonian, might, refer, to, going, downtown, even, though, it, was, north, of, where, they, were, downtown, lay, to, the, south, in, detroit, but, to, the, north, in, cleveland, to, the, east, in, st, louis, and, to, the, west, in, pittsburgh, in, boston, a, resident, pointed, out, in, 1880, downtown, was, in, the, center, of, the, city, uptown, was, north, of, downtown, in, cincinnati, but, south, of, downtown, in, new, orleans, and, san, francisco, notably, downtown, was, not, included, in, dictionaries, as, late, as, the, 1880s, but, by, the, early, 1900s, downtown, was, clearly, established, as, the, proper, term, in, american, english, for, a, city, s, central, business, district, although, the, word, was, virtually, unknown, in, britain, and, western, europe, where, expressions, such, as, city, centre, british, english, el, centro, spanish, das, zentrum, german, etc, are, used, even, as, late, as, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, english, travel, writers, felt, it, necessary, to, explain, to, their, readers, what, downtown, meant, although, american, downtowns, lacked, legally, defined, boundaries, and, were, often, parts, of, several, of, the, wards, that, most, cities, used, as, their, basic, functional, district, locating, the, downtown, area, was, not, difficult, as, it, was, the, place, where, all, the, street, railways, and, elevated, railways, converged, and, at, least, in, most, places, where, the, railroad, terminals, were, it, was, the, location, of, the, great, department, stores, and, hotels, as, well, as, that, of, theaters, clubs, cabarets, and, dance, halls, and, where, skyscrapers, were, built, once, that, technology, was, perfected, it, was, also, frequently, at, first, the, only, part, of, a, city, that, was, electrified, it, was, also, the, place, where, street, congestion, was, the, worst, a, problem, for, which, a, solution, was, never, really, found, but, most, of, all, downtown, was, the, place, where, the, city, did, its, business, inside, its, small, precincts, sometimes, as, small, as, several, hundred, acres, the, majority, of, the, trading, selling, and, purchasing, retail, and, wholesale, in, the, entire, area, would, take, place, there, were, hubs, of, business, in, other, places, around, the, city, and, its, environs, but, the, downtown, area, was, the, chief, one, truly, the, central, business, district, and, as, more, and, more, business, was, done, downtown, those, who, had, their, homes, there, were, gradually, pushed, out, selling, their, property, and, moving, to, quieter, residential, areas, uptown, the, skyscraper, would, become, the, hallmark, of, the, downtown, area, prior, to, the, invention, of, the, elevator, and, later, the, high, speed, elevator, buildings, were, limited, in, height, to, about, six, stories, which, was, a, de, facto, limit, set, by, the, amount, of, stairs, it, was, assumed, that, people, would, climb, but, with, the, elevator, that, limit, was, shattered, and, buildings, began, to, be, constructed, up, to, about, sixteen, stories, what, limited, them, then, was, the, thickness, of, the, masonry, needed, at, the, base, to, hold, the, weight, of, the, building, above, it, as, the, buildings, got, taller, the, thickness, of, the, masonry, and, the, space, needed, for, elevators, did, not, allow, for, sufficient, rentable, space, to, make, the, building, profitable, what, shattered, that, restriction, was, the, invention, of, first, the, iron, and, then, the, steel, frame, building, in, which, the, building, s, load, was, carried, by, an, internal, metal, frame, skeleton, which, the, masonry, and, later, glass, simply, hung, off, of, without, carrying, any, weight, although, first, used, in, chicago, the, steel, framed, skyscraper, caught, on, most, quickly, in, new, york, city, in, the, 1880s, and, from, there, spread, to, most, other, american, cities, in, the, 1890s, and, 1900s, the, apparent, lack, of, a, height, limitation, of, this, type, of, building, set, off, a, fervent, debate, over, whether, their, height, should, be, restricted, by, law, with, proponents, and, opponents, of, height, limits, bringing, out, numerous, arguments, in, favor, of, their, position, the, question, of, height, limits, also, had, a, profound, implication, for, the, nature, of, downtown, itself, would, it, continue, to, be, a, concentrated, core, or, as, it, grew, would, height, limits, force, it, to, spread, out, into, a, larger, area, in, the, short, run, the, proponents, of, height, limits, were, successful, in, their, efforts, by, the, 1910s, most, of, the, large, and, medium, sized, cities, had, height, limits, in, effect, although, new, york, philadelphia, detroit, pittsburgh, and, minneapolis, were, notable, holdouts, ultimately, it, was, not, simple, height, limits, that, restricted, skyscrapers, but, they, were, limited, by, comprehensive, zoning, laws, which, set, up, separate, requirements, for, different, parts, of, a, city, zoning, rules, would, regulate, not, only, height, but, also, a, building, s, volume, the, percentage, of, the, lot, used, and, the, amount, of, light, the, building, blocked, zoning, regulations, sometimes, encouraged, setbacks, step, like, recessions, in, the, outer, wall, making, higher, up, segments, of, the, building, progressively, narrower, than, the, base, to, reduce, a, building, s, bulk, by, allowing, additional, height, per, foot, of, setback, the, exact, amount, depending, on, what, zone, the, building, was, in, the, ultimate, effect, of, setbacks, is, to, increase, the, sunlight, and, visible, sky, at, street, level, new, york, city, was, the, first, to, do, this, with, the, 1916, zoning, resolution, which, was, prompted, in, large, part, by, the, construction, of, the, equitable, building, in, 1915, the, equitable, building, was, a, 40, story, building, with, straight, sides, and, no, setbacks, which, raised, fears, of, the, downtown, area, becoming, a, maze, of, dark, streets, that, never, saw, the, sun, worse, yet, at, least, from, a, real, estate, perspective, this, new, building, created, 1, 2, million, square, feet, 111, 000, m, 2, of, office, space, flooding, into, what, was, already, a, sluggish, market, to, many, in, the, real, estate, industry, the, zoning, law, was, an, example, of, a, reasonable, restriction, once, new, york, had, passed, its, law, other, cities, followed, although, proposed, zoning, measures, did, meet, stiff, resistance, in, some, places, often, because, of, the, inclusion, of, overly, restrictive, height, limits, and, sometimes, because, the, entire, concept, of, zoning, was, seen, as, undemocratic, and, bordering, on, socialism, eventually, a, model, law, the, standard, state, zoning, enabling, act, of, 1922, was, drawn, up, for, the, guidance, of, cities, wishing, to, enact, zoning, regulations, which, are, now, part, of, virtually, every, american, city, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, downtown, area, was, the, business, district, of, the, american, city, but, beginning, around, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, as, cities, continued, to, grow, in, size, and, population, rival, business, districts, began, to, appear, outside, of, downtown, in, outlying, districts, this, was, the, time, when, the, term, central, business, district, began, to, appear, as, more, or, less, synonymous, with, the, downtown, area, the, phrase, acknowledged, the, existence, of, other, business, districts, in, the, city, but, allocated, to, downtown, the, primacy, of, being, central, not, only, geographically, in, many, cities, but, also, in, importance, and, in, many, cases, the, downtown, area, or, central, business, district, itself, began, to, grow, such, as, in, manhattan, where, the, business, district, lower, manhattan, and, the, newer, one, in, midtown, began, to, grow, towards, each, other, or, in, chicago, where, downtown, expanded, from, the, loop, across, the, chicago, river, to, michigan, avenue, in, fact, the, instability, of, downtown, was, a, cause, for, concern, for, business, and, real, estate, interests, as, the, business, district, refused, to, stay, where, it, had, been, and, shifted, its, location, in, response, to, numerous, factors, although, it, generally, stayed, fairly, compact, in, the, early, 1930s, even, the, largest, took, up, less, than, 2, of, the, city, s, space, and, most, were, significantly, smaller, and, remained, the, primary, business, district, of, the, city, real, estate, interests, were, particularly, concerned, about, the, tendency, of, downtown, to, move, because, the, downtown, area, had, by, far, the, highest, land, values, in, each, city, one, commentator, said, that, if, chicago, s, land, values, were, shown, as, height, on, a, relief, map, the, loop, would, be, equivalent, to, the, peaks, of, the, himalayas, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, city, in, 1926, chicago, s, central, business, district, which, took, up, less, than, 1, of, the, city, had, 20, of, the, city, s, land, value, the, same, relationship, was, true, in, st, louis, in, the, mid, 20s, 20, and, los, angeles, in, the, early, 1930s, 17, so, when, a, downtown, area, started, to, shift, its, location, some, property, owners, were, bound, to, lose, a, great, deal, of, money, while, others, would, stand, to, gain, one, way, in, which, downtown, changed, from, the, late, 19th, century, to, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, was, that, industrial, concerns, began, to, leave, downtown, and, move, to, the, periphery, of, the, city, which, meant, that, downtown, s, businesses, were, chiefly, part, of, the, burgeoning, service, sector, brand, new, firms, followed, the, older, ones, and, never, came, to, downtown, settling, at, the, edges, of, the, city, or, the, urban, area, industrial, districts, developed, in, these, areas, which, were, sometimes, specifically, zoned, for, manufacturing, there, land, was, considerably, cheaper, than, downtown, property, taxes, were, lower, transportation, of, supplies, and, finished, products, was, much, easier, without, the, constant, congestion, emblematic, of, downtown, and, with, the, improvement, of, the, telephone, system, the, industrial, firms, could, still, keep, in, touch, with, the, companies, they, did, business, with, elsewhere, as, a, result, of, this, migration, manufacturing, was, no, longer, a, significant, part, of, the, downtown, mix, of, businesses, another, sector, which, began, to, move, away, from, downtown, even, before, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, were, the, great, cultural, institutions, museums, symphony, halls, main, libraries, and, so, on, not, only, was, the, high, cost, of, land, downtown, a, factor, but, these, institutions, wanted, larger, plots, of, land, than, were, available, there, so, that, their, buildings, could, themselves, be, easily, perceived, as, works, of, art, organizations, such, as, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, the, new, york, historical, society, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, and, the, museum, of, the, city, of, new, york, all, in, manhattan, moved, out, of, downtown, as, did, the, museum, of, fine, arts, the, boston, public, library, the, boston, symphony, orchestra, and, the, massachusetts, historical, society, in, boston, the, cleveland, museum, of, art, the, baltimore, museum, of, art, the, detroit, public, library, and, the, detroit, institute, of, art, and, most, of, the, cultural, institutions, in, pittsburgh, public, reaction, to, these, moves, was, mixed, with, some, bemoaning, the, loss, of, a, counterbalance, to, the, overall, materialism, of, downtown, while, others, particularly, those, involved, in, real, estate, looked, positively, on, the, availability, of, the, land, which, the, cultural, institutions, left, behind, the, loss, of, the, major, cultural, institutions, left, downtown, as, a, place, primarily, dedicated, to, business, but, the, loss, of, another, sector, retail, shopping, defined, the, type, of, business, that, was, done, there, the, great, retail, outlets, like, the, department, stores, had, always, had, the, tendency, to, move, closer, to, the, residential, districts, to, make, it, easier, for, their, customers, to, get, to, them, but, after, 1920, they, started, to, congregate, in, secondary, business, districts, on, the, periphery, of, the, city, the, growth, of, chain, stores, such, as, j, c, penney, f, w, woolworth, kresge, and, w, t, grant, contributed, to, the, increased, importance, of, the, outlying, shopping, districts, which, began, outselling, those, retail, stores, which, had, remained, in, the, central, business, district, and, provoked, those, stores, to, open, branches, in, the, secondary, districts, in, attempt, to, go, to, where, there, customers, were, instead, of, having, them, come, downtown, to, them, entertainment, venues, also, contributed, to, the, decentralization, of, commerce, which, affected, the, importance, and, influence, of, downtown, and, the, central, business, district, theaters, vaudeville, houses, dance, halls, and, night, clubs, had, been, primarily, located, in, downtown, with, nickelodeons, spread, throughout, the, city, when, film, became, the, dominant, medium, and, exhibitors, started, to, build, movie, theaters, to, show, them, in, they, at, first, built, those, venues, downtown, as, well, but, as, in, retail, shopping, chain, exhibitors, such, as, loews, began, to, construct, them, in, locations, convenient, to, the, mass, audience, they, were, seeking, again, it, was, a, matter, of, bringing, their, product, to, where, the, people, were, by, the, late, 1920s, movie, houses, outside, of, downtown, far, outnumbered, those, in, the, central, district, not, all, the, movie, theaters, in, the, periphery, were, palaces, but, some, were, and, the, net, effect, was, that, downtown, was, no, longer, the, entertainment, center, of, the, city, with, the, loss, of, manufacturing, the, major, cultural, institutions, much, of, the, retail, shopping, in, the, city, and, its, loss, of, status, as, the, entertainment, center, the, nature, of, downtown, had, changed, considerably, it, was, still, the, location, of, banks, stocks, and, commodity, exchanges, law, and, accounting, firms, the, headquarters, of, the, major, industrial, concerns, and, public, utilities, insurance, companies, and, advertising, agencies, and, in, its, confines, continued, to, be, built, new, and, taller, skyscrapers, housing, offices, hotels, and, even, department, stores, but, it, was, still, steadily, losing, ground, as, decentralization, took, its, toll, its, daytime, population, was, not, keeping, pace, with, the, population, growth, of, the, city, around, it, and, property, values, while, continuing, to, rise, were, not, rising, as, fast, as, those, in, the, secondary, business, districts, downtown, was, still, the, central, business, district, and, was, still, the, most, important, area, for, doing, business, and, commerce, but, it, was, no, longer, as, dominant, as, it, once, was, the, causes, of, decentralization, which, decreased, the, importance, of, downtown, in, the, life, of, american, cities, have, been, ascribed, to, many, factors, including, each, city, s, normal, growth, patterns, advances, in, technology, like, the, telephone, which, made, it, easier, for, business, to, business, intercourse, to, take, place, over, a, distance, thus, lessening, the, need, for, a, centralized, commercial, core, the, rise, of, the, private, automobile, which, allowed, shoppers, to, go, to, peripheral, business, districts, more, easily, a, strong, increase, in, streetcar, fares, and, the, continuing, problem, of, congestion, in, the, narrow, streets, of, the, downtown, area, as, much, as, people, disagreed, about, what, caused, decentralization, they, were, even, less, in, agreement, about, how, decentralization, would, affect, the, central, business, district, with, opinions, varying, all, the, way, from, the, belief, that, it, would, diminish, downtown, sufficiently, that, it, would, eventually, consist, of, only, offices, and, the, headquarters, of, corporate, giants, to, the, belief, that, decentralization, would, lead, to, the, perhaps, deserved, death, of, downtown, entirely, as, unnecessary, a, victim, of, its, untameable, traffic, congestion, in, between, were, those, who, saw, a, diminishment, of, the, area, s, influence, but, not, enough, to, prevent, it, from, remaining, the, sun, that, the, outlying, business, districts, revolved, around, others, doubted, whether, decentralization, had, as, strong, an, impact, as, it, was, credited, with, positions, were, taken, that, downtown, was, a, natural, part, of, the, evolution, of, a, city, or, the, unnatural, result, of, a, de, facto, conspiracy, by, merchants, and, property, owners, so, the, question, of, what, decentralization, would, do, to, downtown, became, bound, up, with, the, question, about, the, area, s, legitimacy, decentralization, also, increased, the, incidences, of, rivalry, between, downtown, and, burgeoning, business, districts, in, los, angeles, for, instance, downtown, and, wilshire, boulevard, battled, for, dominance, and, in, cincinnati, the, rivalry, was, between, the, old, downtown, centered, around, fountain, square, and, the, one, on, canal, street, the, diminishment, of, downtown, by, decentralization, caused, these, battles, to, be, between, areas, that, were, now, more, relatively, equal, like, almost, every, other, aspect, of, american, life, the, great, depression, had, a, major, effect, on, the, country, s, downtown, area, downtown, was, just, coming, off, a, major, building, boom, in, which, significant, amounts, of, new, commercial, and, office, space, hotels, and, department, stores, had, been, built, by, 1931, there, were, 89, buildings, of, 30, stories, or, more, in, manhattan, and, between, 1925, and, 1931, office, space, nearly, doubled, in, chicago, it, increased, by, almost, 75, in, philadelphia, by, almost, two, thirds, and, by, more, than, 50, in, new, orleans, and, denver, in, the, 1920s, 500, 000, additional, hotel, rooms, were, built, in, new, york, and, from, 1927, to, 1931, there, were, 84, large, hotels, built, there, an, increase, of, hotel, space, by, two, thirds, when, the, boom, was, over, and, the, depression, had, begun, to, have, its, effect, much, of, this, new, space, became, unneeded, excess, owners, of, smaller, buildings, who, could, not, keep, a, sufficient, number, of, tenants, to, pay, their, overhead, tore, down, their, buildings, but, whereas, in, the, recent, past, they, would, have, been, replaced, with, taller, buildings, now, they, became, one, and, two, story, parking, garages, or, ground, level, parking, lots, these, were, widely, known, as, taxpayers, as, they, generated, enough, revenue, for, the, owner, of, the, lot, to, pay, the, taxes, on, it, rents, fell, sometimes, as, much, as, 30, and, non, payment, of, rent, increased, even, with, the, taxpayers, taking, away, commercial, space, vacancy, rates, rose, precipitously, owners, went, into, default, and, downtown, real, estate, lost, considerable, value, 25, 30, in, the, chicago, loop, although, values, in, other, parts, of, the, city, including, the, outlying, business, districts, fared, even, worse, department, stores, were, hit, hard, most, managed, to, keep, their, doors, open, but, few, made, money, hotels, which, needed, to, have, large, staffs, and, required, high, occupancy, rates, to, make, a, profit, were, also, deeply, affected, in, manhattan, the, hotel, occupancy, rate, fell, from, 1929, s, 70, to, around, 50, in, 1933, room, rates, were, slashed, revenue, dropped, and, many, hotels, closed, or, defaulted, by, 1934, 80, of, hotels, in, manhattan, were, owned, by, their, creditors, the, slow, recovery, from, the, effects, of, the, great, depression, began, in, the, mid, 1930s, decelerated, at, the, end, of, the, 1930s, and, picked, up, speed, with, the, start, of, world, war, ii, so, that, by, the, early, 1940s, the, country, was, for, the, most, part, out, of, the, depression, excess, commercial, space, began, to, be, used, vacancy, rates, dropped, department, store, sales, rose, hotel, occupancy, rates, went, up, and, revenues, increased, despite, this, recovery, the, daytime, population, of, the, country, s, downtowns, did, not, rebound, for, instance, in, chicago, between, 1929, and, 1949, the, population, of, the, city, grew, 7, and, that, of, the, entire, metropolitan, area, by, about, 14, but, the, daytime, population, of, the, loop, only, rose, 1, 3, of, 1, with, a, few, exceptions, such, as, new, york, city, this, pattern, was, typical, across, american, cities, and, was, tied, to, the, slowing, down, of, the, rate, of, growth, of, the, cities, themselves, cities, in, the, us, grew, much, more, slowly, than, during, any, other, period, in, the, history, of, the, country, and, some, even, lost, population, metropolitan, regions, grew, faster, than, the, cities, inside, them, indicating, the, start, of, the, decades, of, urban, sprawl, but, they, too, grew, at, a, slower, pace, than, usual, downtowns, also, had, less, daytime, population, because, people, now, went, to, the, outlying, business, districts, which, were, closer, to, their, homes, by, car, for, their, shopping, and, entertainment, to, do, business, and, to, work, the, increased, use, of, automobiles, over, mass, transit, also, damaged, downtown, since, the, streetcar, lines, converged, on, downtown, while, the, roads, went, everywhere, all, of, these, factors, contributed, to, the, lesser, recovery, of, downtown, relative, to, the, city, as, a, whole, and, the, metropolitan, area, another, sign, that, downtowns, were, no, longer, as, central, to, city, life, as, they, once, were, include, the, decreased, portion, of, retail, trade, that, took, place, there, as, compared, to, the, peripheral, business, areas, which, profited, by, the, growth, of, the, chain, stores, to, the, detriment, of, the, big, downtown, department, stores, furthermore, the, taxpayers, which, many, people, had, expected, to, disappear, once, the, economy, improved, remained, in, place, and, even, increased, in, number, in, the, loop, in, chicago, by, the, early, 1940s, 18, of, the, land, was, vacant, or, was, used, for, parking, in, los, angeles, at, the, same, time, the, figure, was, 25, demand, for, commercial, space, was, so, light, that, it, did, not, make, financial, sense, to, construct, expensive, new, buildings, and, banks, began, to, refuse, to, make, loans, for, that, purpose, redlining, whole, neighborhoods, in, the, central, business, district, the, typical, american, downtown, has, certain, unique, characteristics, during, the, postwar, economic, boom, in, the, 1950s, the, residential, population, of, most, downtowns, crashed, this, has, been, attributed, to, reasons, such, as, slum, clearance, construction, of, the, interstate, highway, system, and, white, flight, from, urban, cores, to, rapidly, expanding, suburbs, due, to, well, intended, but, ineptly, executed, urban, revitalization, projects, downtowns, eventually, came, to, be, dominated, by, high, rise, office, buildings, in, which, commuters, from, the, suburbs, filled, white, collar, jobs, while, the, remaining, residential, populations, sank, further, into, unemployment, poverty, and, homelessness, by, the, 1990s, many, office, oriented, businesses, began, to, abandon, the, tired, old, downtowns, for, the, suburbs, resulting, in, what, are, now, known,
