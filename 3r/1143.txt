importance, since, by, a, papal, bull, of, 1772, and, a, royal, certificate, of, 1773, of, charles, iii, of, spain, it, was, declared, nica, iglesia, inmune, en, esta, ciudad, construida, en, 1855,

the, railroad, in, 1837, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, sugar, and, coffee, production, increased, rapidly, which, became, essential, in, the, development, of, havana, s, most, prominent, architectural, style, many, wealthy, habaneros, took, their, inspiration, from, the, french, this, can, be, seen, within, the, interiors, of, upper, class, houses, such, as, the, aldama, palace, built, in, 1844, this, is, considered, the, most, important, neoclassical, residential, building, in, cuba, and, typifies, the, design, of, many, houses, of, this, period, with, portales, of, neoclassical, columns, facing, open, spaces, or, courtyards, in, 1925, jean, claude, nicolas, forestier, the, head, of, urban, planning, in, paris, moved, to, havana, for, five, years, to, collaborate, with, architects, and, landscape, designers, in, the, master, planning, of, the, city, his, aim, was, to, create, a, harmonic, balance, between, the, classical, built, form, and, the, tropical, landscape, he, embraced, and, connected, the, city, s, road, networks, while, accentuating, prominent, landmarks, his, influence, has, left, a, huge, mark, on, havana, although, many, of, his, ideas, were, cut, short, by, the, great, depression, in, 1929, during, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, havana, expanded, more, rapidly, than, at, any, time, during, its, history, great, wealth, prompted, architectural, styles, to, be, influenced, from, abroad, the, peak, of, neoclassicism, came, with, the, construction, of, the, vedado, district, begun, in, 1859, this, area, features, a, number, of, set, back, well, proportioned, buildings, in, the, neoclassical, style, built, in, 1875, in, the, reparto, de, las, las, murallas, wide, strip, of, land, that, remained, after, the, city, walls, were, demolished, in, 1863, it, was, the, work, of, the, architect, eugenio, rayneri, y, sorrentino, around, 1880, the, mansion, was, owned, by, the, count, of, casa, mor,

were, dedicated, to, housing, on, its, upper, floor, the, spanish, center, and, the, israeli, center, of, cuba, had, their, headquarters, the, palace, of, the, marquesa, de, villalba, and, the, mercado, de, tac, n, were, designed, by, the, eugenio, rayneri, y, sorrentino, at, almost, the, same, time, 1875, and, 1876, respectively, each, in, a, style, that, accommodated, the, particular, typology, residential, and, commercial, thus, conceiving, each, work, with, the, formal, element, accommodating, different, aesthetic, requirements, the, property, is, after, the, aldama, palace, the, strongest, example, of, cuban, neoclassicism, the, palace, of, the, marquesa, de, villalba, is, in, the, neoclassical, style, perhaps, only, comparable, in, havana, according, to, alina, castellanos, to, the, aldama, palace, but, while, the, latter, limits, the, decoration, to, the, natural, slenderness, of, the, colonnade, in, the, most, classical, way, of, the, greek, parthenon, the, former, uses, roman, and, renaissance, elaborations, hence, the, arcade, has, been, projected, on, pillars, the, building, was, crowned, with, a, considerable, cornice, the, neoclassical, decoration, can, also, be, seen, in, the, window, covers, which, take, alternate, forms, of, a, triangular, or, semicircular, pediment, and, glass, over, the, door, similar, to, the, plaza, del, vapor, the, palacio, de, aldama, is, a, neoclassical, mansion, located, diagonally, opposite, to, the, old, plaza, del, vapor, parque, del, curita, and, in, front, of, the, old, campo, de, marte, present, day, parque, de,

sugar, magnate, who, owned, the, building, however, it, was, soon, sold, to, canadian, wilbur, e, todgham, who, turned, it, into, the, famed, royal, palm, hotel, the, commercial, function, of, the, ground, floor, has, been, preserved, to, date, taking, advantage, of, its, excellent, location, on, boulevard, de, san, rafael, taking, into, account, the, architectural, values, of, this, building, and, its, socio, cultural, importance, within, the, urban, landscape, in, which, it, is, located, the, building, received, a, major, restoration, in, 2000, with, the, support, of, the, provincial,
