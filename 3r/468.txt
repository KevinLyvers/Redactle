companies, slumped, private, data, are, bad, too, in, 2019, sales, at, the, biggest, brewer, fell, by, 5, sales, of, cement, by, the, two, biggest, producers, were, almost, flat, none, of, these, things, is, likely, if, growth, is, storming, ahead, the, discrepancies, are, so, large, that, it, is, hard, to, avoid, the, conclusion, that, the, government, is, lying, tim, staermose, a, proponent, of, african, investment, took, issue, with, these, data, some, of, these, statements, by, the, economist, based, on, the, evidence, i, have, gathered, from, primary, sources, namely, the, statutory, financial, reports, that, listed, companies, in, tanzania, are, legally, obligated, to, release, are, simply, not, true, bank, lending, to, companies, as, far, as, i, can, see, has, not, slumped, the, two, biggest, banks, in, tanzania, which, between, them, account, for, approximately, 40, of, the, banking, sector, both, reported, strong, loan, growth, in, 2019, as, for, cement, sales, being, almost, flat, again, this, is, total, nonsense, in, 2019, twiga, sold, 6, more, cement, by, volume, than, it, did, in, 2018, in, the, first, six, months, of, 2020, twiga, already, sold, 8, more, cement, than, it, had, done, by, the, same, stage, in, 2019, again, these, numbers, are, very, consistent, with, an, economy, that, s, reported, to, be, growing, at, around, 7, per, annum, the, 5, fall, in, beer, sales, in, 2019, the, published, 2019, annual, report, by, tanzania, breweries, limited, tbl, will, tell, you, there, were, one, off, circumstances, that, largely, drove, the, decline, resulted, in, sales, falling, but, tbl, s, profits, actually, rose, in, 2019, poor, nutrition, remains, a, persistent, problem, within, tanzania, and, varies, hugely, throughout, the, country, s,

children, under, 5, years, old, falling, from, 46, to, 31, in, 2005, and, 2010, respectively, dodoma, on, the, other, hand, saw, a, 7, increase, in, the, prevalence, of, stunting, in, this, age, group, rising, from, 50, in, 2005, to, 57, in, 2010, overall, availability, of, food, does, not, necessarily, contribute, to, overall, stunting, figures, iringa, mbeya, and, rukwa, regions, where, overall, availability, of, food, is, considered, acceptable, still, experience, stunting, incidents, in, excess, of, 50, in, some, areas, where, food, shortages, are, common, such, as, in, the, tabora, and, singida, regions, stunting, instances, remain, comparatively, less, than, those, seen, in, iringa, mbeya, and, rukwa, the, tanzania, food, and, nutrition, centre, attributes, these, discrepancies, to, variance, in, maternal, malnutrition, poor, infant, feeding, practices, hygiene, practices, and, poor, healthcare, services, periods, of, drought, can, have, significant, impacts, on, the, production, of, crops, in, tanzania, drought, in, east, africa, has, resulted, in, massive, increases, in, the, prices, of, food, staples, such, as, maize, and, sorghum, crops, crucial, to,

compared, to, 64, of, residents, in, cities, this, disparity, between, rural, and, city, nutrition, can, be, attributed, to, various, factors, increased, nutritional, needs, due, to, manual, labour,
