lake, malawi, also, known, as, lake, nyasa, in, tanzania, and, lago, niassa, in, mozambique, swahili, ziwa, nyasa, is, an, african, great, lake, and, the, southernmost, lake, in, the, east, african, rift, system, located, between, malawi, mozambique, and, tanzania, it, is, the, fourth, largest, freshwater, lake, in, the, world, by, volume, the, ninth, largest, lake, in, the, world, by, area, and, the, third, largest, and, second, deepest, lake, in, africa, lake, malawi, is, home, to, more, species, of, fish, than, any, other, lake, in, the, world, including, at, least, 700, species, of, cichlids, the, mozambique, portion, of, the, lake, was, officially, declared, a, reserve, by, the, government, of, mozambique, on, june, 10, 2011, while, in, malawi, a, portion, of, the, lake, is, included, in, lake, malawi, national, park, lake, malawi, is, a, meromictic, lake, meaning, that, its, water, layers, do, not, mix, the, permanent, stratification, of, lake, malawi, s, water, and, the, oxic, anoxic, boundary, are, maintained, by, moderately, small, chemical, and, thermal, gradients, lake, malawi, is, between, 560, kilometres, 350, mi, and, 580, kilometres, 360, mi, long, and, about, 75, kilometres, 47, mi, wide, at, its, widest, point, the, lake, has, a, total, surface, area, of, about, 29, 600, square, kilometres, 11, 400, sq, mi, the, lake, is, 706, m, 2, 316, ft, at, its, deepest, point, located, in, a, major, depression, in, the, north, central, part, another, smaller, depression, in, the, far, north, reaches, a, depth, of, 528, m, 1, 732, ft, the, southern, half, of, the, lake, is, shallower, less, than, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, in, the, south, central, part, and, less, than, 200, m, 660, ft, in, the, far, south, the, lake, has, shorelines, on, western, mozambique, eastern, malawi, and, southern, tanzania, the, largest, river, flowing, into, it, is, the, ruhuhu, river, and, there, is, an, outlet, at, its, southern, end, the, shire, river, a, tributary, that, flows, into, the, zambezi, river, in, mozambique, evaporation, accounts, for, more, than, 80, of, the, water, loss, from, the, lake, considerably, more, than, the, outflowing, shire, river, the, outflows, from, lake, malawi, into, the, shire, river, are, vital, for, the, economy, as, the, water, resources, support, hydropower, irrigation, and, downstream, biodiversity, concerns, have, been, raised, over, the, future, climate, change, impacts, of, lake, malawi, due, to, the, recent, decline, in, lake, levels, and, the, overall, drying, trend, the, climate, in, the, lake, region, is, already, experiencing, changes, with, the, temperatures, predicted, to, increase, throughout, the, country, the, lake, is, about, 350, kilometres, 220, mi, southeast, of, lake, tanganyika, another, of, the, great, lakes, of, the, east, african, rift, the, lake, malawi, national, park, is, located, at, the, southern, end, of, the, lake, malawi, is, one, of, the, major, rift, valley, lakes, and, an, ancient, lake, the, lake, lies, in, a, valley, formed, by, the, opening, of, the, east, african, rift, where, the, african, tectonic, plate, is, being, split, into, two, pieces, this, is, called, a, divergent, plate, tectonics, boundary, malawi, has, typically, been, estimated, to, be, 1, 2, million, years, old, mya, but, more, recent, evidence, points, to, a, considerably, older, lake, with, a, basin, that, started, to, form, about, 8, 6, mya, and, deep, water, condition, first, appeared, 4, 5, mya, the, water, levels, have, varied, dramatically, over, time, ranging, from, almost, 600, m, 2, 000, ft, below, current, level, to, 10, 20, m, 33, 66, ft, above, during, periods, the, lake, dried, out, almost, completely, leaving, only, one, or, two, relatively, small, highly, alkaline, and, saline, lakes, in, what, currently, are, malawi, s, deepest, parts, a, water, chemistry, resembling, the, current, conditions, only, appeared, about, 60, 000, years, ago, major, low, water, periods, are, estimated, to, have, occurred, about, 1, 6, to, 1, 0, 0, 57, million, years, ago, where, it, might, have, dried, out, completely, 420, 000, to, 250, 000, 110, 000, years, ago, about, 25, 000, years, ago, and, 18, 000, 10, 700, years, ago, during, the, peak, of, the, low, water, period, between, 1390, and, 1860, ad, it, may, have, been, 120, 150, m, 390, 490, ft, below, current, water, levels, the, lake, s, water, is, alkaline, ph, 7, 7, 8, 6, and, warm, with, a, typical, surface, temperature, between, 24, and, 29, c, 75, 84, f, while, deep, sections, typically, are, about, 22, c, 72, f, the, thermocline, is, located, at, a, depth, of, 40, 100, m, 130, 330, ft, the, oxygen, limit, is, at, a, depth, of, approximately, 250, m, 820, ft, effectively, restricting, fish, and, other, aerobic, organisms, to, the, upper, part, the, water, is, very, clear, for, a, lake, and, the, visibility, can, be, up, to, 20, m, 66, ft, but, slightly, less, than, half, this, figure, is, more, common, and, it, is, below, 3, m, 10, ft, in, muddy, bays, however, during, the, rainy, season, months, of, january, to, march, the, waters, are, more, muddy, due, to, muddy, river, inflows, the, portuguese, trader, candido, jos, da, costa, cardoso, was, the, first, european, to, visit, the, lake, in, 1846, david, livingstone, reached, the, lake, in, 1859, and, named, it, lake, nyasa, he, also, referred, to, it, by, a, pair, of, nicknames, lake, of, stars, and, lake, of, storms, the, lake, of, stars, nickname, came, after, livingstone, observed, lights, from, the, lanterns, of, the, fishermen, in, malawi, on, their, boats, that, resemble, from, a, distance, stars, in, the, sky, later, after, experiencing, the, unpredictable, and, extremely, violent, gales, that, sweep, through, the, area, he, also, referred, to, it, as, the, lake, of, storms, on, 16, august, 1914, lake, malawi, was, the, scene, of, a, brief, naval, battle, during, world, war, i, the, british, gunboat, ss, gwendolen, commanded, by, a, captain, rhoades, received, orders, from, the, british, empire, s, high, command, to, sink, burn, or, destroy, the, german, empire, s, only, gunboat, on, the, lake, the, hermann, von, wissmann, commanded, by, captain, berndt, rhoades, s, crew, found, the, hermann, von, wissmann, in, a, bay, near, sphinxhaven, in, german, east, african, territorial, waters, gwendolen, disabled, the, german, boat, with, a, single, cannon, shot, from, a, range, of, about, 1, 800, metres, 2, 000, yd, this, brief, conflict, was, hailed, by, the, times, in, england, as, the, british, empire, s, first, naval, victory, of, world, war, i, the, partition, of, the, lake, s, surface, area, between, malawi, and, tanzania, is, under, dispute, tanzania, claims, that, the, international, border, runs, through, the, middle, of, the, lake, on, the, other, hand, malawi, claims, the, whole, of, the, surface, of, this, lake, that, is, not, in, mozambique, including, the, waters, that, are, next, to, the, shoreline, of, tanzania, both, sides, cite, the, heligoland, treaty, of, 1890, between, great, britain, and, germany, concerning, the, border, the, wrangle, in, this, dispute, occurred, when, the, british, colonial, government, just, after, they, had, captured, tanganyika, from, germany, placed, all, of, the, waters, of, the, lake, under, a, single, jurisdiction, that, of, the, territory, of, nyasaland, without, a, separate, administration, for, the, tanganyikan, portion, of, the, surface, later, in, colonial, times, two, jurisdictions, were, established, the, dispute, came, to, a, head, in, 1967, when, tanzania, officially, protested, to, malawi, however, nothing, was, settled, occasional, flare, ups, of, conflict, occurred, during, the, 1990s, and, in, the, 21st, century, in, 2012, malawi, s, oil, exploration, initiative, brought, the, issue, to, the, fore, with, tanzania, demanding, that, exploration, cease, until, the, dispute, was, settled, in, 1954, an, agreement, was, signed, between, the, british, and, the, portuguese, making, the, middle, of, the, lake, their, boundary, with, the, exception, of, chizumulu, island, and, likoma, island, which, were, kept, by, the, british, and, are, now, part, of, malawi, mv, chauncy, maples, began, service, on, the, lake, in, 1901, as, the, ss, chauncy, maples, a, floating, clinic, and, church, for, the, universities, mission, to, central, africa, she, later, served, as, a, ferry, and, is, currently, being, renovated, into, a, mobile, clinic, at, monkey, bay, the, renovation, was, expected, to, be, complete, during, the, first, half, of, 2014, but, was, halted, in, 2017, mv, mpasa, entered, service, in, 1935, the, ferry, mv, ilala, entered, service, in, 1951, in, recent, years, she, has, often, been, out, of, service, but, when, operational, she, runs, between, monkey, bay, at, the, southern, end, of, the, lake, to, karonga, on, the, northern, end, and, occasionally, to, the, iringa, region, of, tanzania, the, ferry, mv, mtendere, entered, service, in, 1980, by, 1982, she, was, carrying, 100, 000, passengers, each, year, but, as, of, 2014, she, was, out, of, service, she, normally, serves, the, southern, part, of, the, lake, but, if, ilala, was, out, of, service, she, operated, the, route, to, karonga, the, tanzanian, ferry, mv, songea, was, built, in, 1988, her, operator, was, the, tanzania, railway, corporation, marine, division, until, 1997, when, it, became, the, marine, services, company, limited, songea, plies, weekly, between, liuli, and, nkhata, bay, via, itungi, and, mbamba, bay, the, worst, lake, disaster, was, the, sinking, of, the, mv, vipya, in, 1946, which, resulted, in, 145, deaths, wildlife, found, in, and, around, lake, malawi, or, nyasa, includes, nile, crocodiles, hippopotamus, monkeys, and, a, significant, population, of, african, fish, eagles, that, feed, off, fish, from, the, lake, lake, malawi, has, for, millennia, provided, a, major, food, source, to, the, residents, of, its, shores, since, its, waters, are, rich, in, fish, among, the, most, popular, are, the, four, species, of, chambo, consisting, of, any, one, of, four, species, in, the, subgenus, nyasalapia, oreochromis, karongae, o, lidole, o, saka, and, o, squamipinnis, as, well, as, the, closely, related, o, shiranus, other, species, that, support, important, fisheries, include, the, lake, malawi, sardine, engraulicypris, sardella, and, the, large, kampango, catfish, bagrus, meridionalis, most, fishing, provides, food, for, the, increasing, human, population, near, the, lake, but, some, are, exported, from, malawi, the, wild, population, of, fish, is, increasingly, threatened, by, overfishing, and, water, pollution, a, drop, in, the, lake, s, water, level, represents, another, threat, and, is, believed, to, be, driven, by, water, extraction, by, the, increasing, human, population, climate, change, and, deforestation, the, chambo, and, kampango, have, been, particularly, overfished, the, kampango, declined, by, about, 90, from, 2006, to, 2016, o, karongae, and, o, squamipinnis, by, about, 94, and, o, lidole, might, already, be, extinct, and, they, are, now, seriously, threatened, the, iucn, recognises, 117, species, of, malawi, cichlids, as, threatened, some, of, these, have, tiny, ranges, and, may, be, restricted, to, rocky, coastlines, only, a, few, hundred, metres, long, 1, diplotaxodon, one, of, the, very, few, cichlid, genera, that, occurs, offshore, in, relatively, deep, water, 2, nimbochromis, livingstonii, is, a, piscivorous, hap, that, is, famous, for, playing, dead, to, lure, prey, close, 3, as, typical, of, utaka, copadichromis, azureus, has, bright, blue, males, shown, and, duller, females, that, are, silvery, with, dark, spots, 4, aulonocara, stuartgranti, is, part, of, a, group, of, relatively, peaceful, species, popularly, known, as, peacock, cichlids, 5, fossorochromis, rostratus, is, an, aberrant, hap, that, often, sifts, mouthfuls, of, sand, to, extract, small, food, organisms, 6, like, many, mbuna, pseudotropheus, saulosi, is, a, small, cichlid, where, both, male, blue, and, black, and, female, yellow, are, colorful, lake, malawi, is, noted, for, being, the, site, of, evolutionary, radiations, among, several, groups, of, animals, most, notably, cichlid, fish, there, are, at, least, 700, cichlid, species, in, lake, malawi, with, some, estimating, that, the, actual, figure, is, as, high, as, 1, 000, species, the, actual, number, is, labelled, with, some, uncertainty, because, of, the, many, undescribed, species, and, the, extreme, variation, among, some, species, making, the, task, of, delimiting, them, very, complex, except, for, four, species, astatotilapia, calliptera, coptodon, rendalli, oreochromis, shiranus, and, serranochromis, robustus, all, cichlids, in, the, lake, are, endemic, to, the, malawi, system, which, also, includes, nearby, smaller, lake, malombe, and, the, upper, shire, river, many, of, these, have, become, popular, among, aquarium, owners, due, to, their, bright, colors, recreating, a, lake, malawi, biotope, to, host, cichlids, became, quite, popular, in, the, aquarium, hobby, most, malawi, cichlids, are, found, in, relatively, shallow, coastal, waters, but, diplotaxodon, has, been, recorded, down, to, depths, of, 200, 220, m, 660, 720, ft, and, several, especially, diplotaxodon, rhamphochromis, and, copadichromis, quadrimaculatus, are, known, from, pelagic, waters, the, cichlids, of, the, lake, are, divided, into, two, groups, and, the, vast, majority, of, the, species, are, haplochromines, the, sister, species, to, the, malawi, haplochromines, is, astatotilapia, sp, ruaha, a, currently, undescribed, species, from, great, ruaha, river, and, these, two, separated, between, 2, 13, and, 6, 76, million, years, ago, mya, the, earliest, divergence, within, the, malawi, haplochromines, occurred, between, 1, 20, and, 4, 06, mya, but, most, radiations, in, this, group, are, far, younger, in, extreme, cases, species, may, have, diverged, only, a, few, hundred, years, ago, the, malawi, haplochromines, are, mouthbrooders, but, otherwise, vary, extensively, in, general, behaviour, and, ecology, within, the, malawi, haplochromines, there, are, two, main, groups, the, haps, and, the, mbuna, the, haps, they, were, formerly, included, in, haplochromis, can, be, further, subdivided, into, three, subgroups, the, relatively, large, often, more, than, 20, cm, 8, in, long, and, aggressive, piscivores, that, roam, various, habitats, in, pursuit, of, prey, the, open, water, although, often, not, far, from, sand, or, rocks, utaka, that, feed, in, schools, on, zooplankton, and, typically, are, of, medium, size, and, finally, a, subgroup, of, aberrant, species, that, essentially, are, defined, by, them, not, fitting, clearly, into, the, other, subgroups, adult, male, haps, generally, display, bright, colors, while, juveniles, of, both, sexes, and, adult, females, typically, show, a, silvery, or, grey, coloration, with, sometimes, irregular, black, bars, or, other, markings, the, second, main, haplochromine, group, are, the, mbuna, a, name, used, both, locally, and, popularly, which, means, rockfish, in, tonga, they, are, found, at, rocky, outcrops, territorially, aggressive, although, commonly, found, in, high, densities, and, often, specialised, aufwuchs, feeders, the, mbuna, species, tend, to, be, relatively, small, mostly, less, than, 13, cm, 5, in, long, and, often, both, sexes, are, brightly, colored, with, males, having, egg, shaped, yellow, spots, on, their, anal, fin, a, feature, particularly, prevalent, in, the, mbuna, but, not, exclusive, to, this, group, the, second, group, the, tilapia, comprises, only, six, species, in, two, genera, in, lake, malawi, the, redbreast, tilapia, coptodon, rendalli, a, widespread, african, species, is, the, only, substrate, spawning, cichlid, in, the, lake, this, large, cichlid, mainly, feeds, on, macrophytes, the, remaining, are, five, mouthbrooding, species, of, oreochromis, four, chambo, in, the, subgenus, nyasalapia, o, karongae, o, lidole, o, saka, and, o, squamipinnis, that, are, endemic, to, the, lake, malawi, system, as, well, as, the, closely, related, o, shiranus, which, also, is, found, in, lake, chilwa, the, malawi, oreochromis, mainly, feed, on, phytoplankton, reach, lengths, up, to, 26, 42, cm, 10, 17, in, depending, on, the, exact, species, and, are, mostly, black, or, silvery, gray, with, relatively, indistinct, dark, bars, male, chambo, have, unique, genital, tassels, when, breeding, which, aid, in, egg, fertilisation, in, a, manner, comparable, to, the, egg, spots, on, the, anal, fin, of, haplochromines, the, vast, majority, of, the, fish, species, in, the, lake, are, cichlids, among, the, non, cichlid, native, fish, are, several, species, of, cyprinids, in, genera, barbus, labeo, and, opsaridium, and, the, lake, malawi, sardine, engraulicypris, sardella, airbreathing, catfish, bathyclarias, and, clarias, and, the, kampango, bagrus, meridionalis, mochokid, catfish, chiloglanis, and, malawi, squeaker, synodontis, njassae, mastacembelus, spiny, eel, mormyrids, marcusenius, mormyrops, and, petrocephalus, the, african, tetra, brycinus, imberi, the, poeciliid, aplocheilichthys, johnstoni, the, spotted, killifish, nothobranchius, orthonotus, and, the, mottled, eel, anguilla, nebulosa, at, a, genus, level, most, of, these, are, widespread, in, africa, but, bathyclarias, is, entirely, restricted, to, the, lake, lake, malawi, is, home, to, 28, species, of, freshwater, snails, including, 16, endemics, and, 9, bivalves, 2, endemics, aspatharia, subreniformis, and, the, unionid, nyassunio, nyassaensis, the, endemic, freshwater, snails, are, all, members, of, the, genera, bellamya, bulinus, gabbiella, lanistes, and, melanoides, lake, malawi, is, home, to, a, total, of, four, snail, species, in, the, genus, bulinus, which, is, a, known, intermediate, host, of, bilharzia, a, survey, in, monkey, bay, in, 1964, found, two, endemic, species, of, snails, of, the, genus, b, nyassanus, and, b, succinoides, in, the, lake, and, two, non, endemic, species, b, globosus, and, b, forskalli, in, lagoons, separated, from, it, the, latter, species, are, known, intermediate, hosts, of, bilharzia, and, larvae, of, the, parasite, were, detected, in, water, containing, these, but, in, experiments, c, wright, of, the, british, museum, of, natural, history, was, unable, to, infect, the, two, species, endemic, to, the, lake, with, the, parasites, the, field, workers, who, spent, many, hours, on, and, in, the, lake, did, not, find, either, b, globosus, or, b, forskalli, in, the, lake, itself, more, recently, the, disease, has, become, a, problem, in, the, lake, itself, as, the, endemic, b, nyassanus, has, become, an, intermediate, host, this, change, first, noticed, in, the, mid, 1980s, is, possibly, related, to, a, decline, in, snail, eating, cichlids, for, example, trematocranus, placodon, due, to, overfishing, and, or, a, new, strain, of, the, bilharzia, parasite, unlike, lake, tanganyika, with, its, many, endemic, freshwater, crabs, and, shrimp, there, are, few, such, species, in, lake, malawi, the, malawi, blue, crab, potamonautes, lirrangensis, syn, p, orbitospinus, is, the, only, crab, in, the, lake, and, it, is, not, endemic, the, atyid, shrimp, caridina, malawensis, is, endemic, to, the, lake, but, it, is, poorly, known, and, has, historically, been, confused, with, c, nilotica, which, is, not, found, in, the, lake, pelagic, zooplanktonic, species, include, two, cladocerans, diaphanosoma, excisum, and, bosmina, longirostris, three, copepods, tropodiaptomus, cunningtoni, thermocyclops, neglectus, and, mesocyclops, aequatorialis, and, several, ostracods, including, both, described, and, undescribed, species, lake, malawi, is, famous, for, the, huge, swarms, of, tiny, harmless, lake, flies, chaoborus, edulis, these, swarms, typically, appearing, far, out, over, water, can, be, mistaken, for, plumes, of, smoke, and, were, also, noticed, by, david, livingstone, when, he, visited, the, lake, the, aquatic, larvae, feed, on, zooplankton, spending, the, day, at, the, bottom, and, the, night, in, the, upper, water, levels, when, they, pupate, they, float, to, the, surface, and, transform, into, adult, flies, the, adults, are, very, short, lived, and, the, swarms, which, can, be, several, hundred, metres, tall, and, often, have, a, spiraling, shape, are, part, of, their, mating, behaviour, they, lay, their, eggs, at, the, water, s, surface, and, the, adults, die, the, larvae, are, an, important, food, source, for, fish, and, the, adult, flies, are, important, both, to, birds, and, local, people, who, collect, them, to, make, kungu, cakes, burgers, a, local, delicacy, with, a, very, high, protein, content, in, january, 2015, a, sediment, control, tank, collapsed, at, the, paladin, energy, owned, uranium, mine, in, northern, malawi, after, a, high, intensity, rain, storm, hit, the, area, it, was, revealed, that, approximately, 50, litres, of, non, radioactive, material, leaked, into, a, local, creek, despite, reports, in, local, media, of, radioactive, contamination, the, government, conducted, independent, scientific, tests, on, the, local, river, system, and, found, that, there, was, no, effect, on, the, environment, the, 25, km, solo, swim, across, lake, malawi,
