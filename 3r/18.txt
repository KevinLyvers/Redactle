borders, are, generally, defined, as, geographical, boundaries, imposed, either, by, features, such, as, oceans, and, terrain, or, by, political, entities, such, as, governments, sovereign, states, federated, states, and, other, subnational, entities, political, borders, can, be, established, through, warfare, colonization, or, mutual, agreements, between, the, political, entities, that, reside, in, those, areas, some, borders, such, as, most, states, internal, administrative, borders, or, inter, state, borders, within, the, schengen, area, are, open, and, completely, unguarded, most, external, political, borders, are, partially, or, fully, controlled, and, may, be, crossed, legally, only, at, designated, border, checkpoints, adjacent, border, zones, may, also, be, controlled, buffer, zones, may, be, set, up, on, borders, between, belligerent, entities, to, lower, the, risk, of, escalation, while, border, refers, to, the, boundary, itself, the, area, around, the, border, is, called, the, frontier, for, the, purposes, of, border, control, airports, and, seaports, are, also, classed, as, borders, most, countries, have, some, form, of, border, control, to, regulate, or, limit, the, movement, of, people, animals, and, goods, into, and, out, of, the, country, under, international, law, each, country, is, generally, permitted, to, legislate, the, conditions, that, have, to, be, met, in, order, to, cross, its, borders, and, to, prevent, people, from, crossing, its, borders, in, violation, of, those, laws, some, borders, require, presentation, of, legal, paperwork, like, passports, and, visas, or, other, identity, documents, for, persons, to, cross, borders, to, stay, or, work, within, a, country, s, borders, aliens, foreign, persons, may, need, special, immigration, documents, or, permits, but, possession, of, such, documents, does, not, guarantee, that, the, person, should, be, allowed, to, cross, the, border, moving, goods, across, a, border, often, requires, the, payment, of, excise, tax, often, collected, by, customs, officials, animals, and, occasionally, humans, moving, across, borders, may, need, to, go, into, quarantine, to, prevent, the, spread, of, exotic, infectious, diseases, most, countries, prohibit, carrying, illegal, drugs, or, endangered, animals, across, their, borders, moving, goods, animals, or, people, illegally, across, a, border, without, declaring, them, or, seeking, permission, or, deliberately, evading, official, inspection, constitutes, smuggling, controls, on, car, liability, insurance, validity, and, other, formalities, may, also, take, place, in, places, where, smuggling, migration, and, infiltration, are, a, problem, many, countries, fortify, borders, with, fences, and, barriers, and, institute, formal, border, control, procedures, these, can, extend, inland, as, in, the, united, states, where, the, u, s, customs, and, border, protection, service, has, jurisdiction, to, operate, up, to, 100, miles, from, any, land, or, sea, boundary, on, the, other, hand, some, borders, are, merely, signposted, this, is, common, in, countries, within, the, european, schengen, area, and, on, rural, sections, of, the, canada, united, states, border, borders, may, even, be, completely, unmarked, typically, in, remote, or, forested, regions, such, borders, are, often, described, as, porous, migration, within, territorial, borders, and, outside, of, them, represented, an, old, and, established, pattern, of, movement, in, african, countries, in, seeking, work, and, food, and, to, maintain, ties, with, kin, who, had, moved, across, the, previously, porous, borders, of, their, homelands, when, the, colonial, frontiers, were, drawn, western, countries, attempted, to, obtain, a, monopoly, on, the, recruitment, of, labor, in, many, african, countries, which, altered, the, practical, and, institutional, context, in, which, the, old, migration, patterns, had, been, followed, and, some, might, argue, are, still, followed, today, the, frontiers, were, particularly, porous, for, the, physical, movement, of, migrants, and, people, living, in, borderlands, easily, maintained, transnational, cultural, and, social, networks, a, border, may, have, been, in, addition, a, border, may, be, a, de, facto, military, ceasefire, line, in, the, pre, modern, world, the, term, border, was, vague, and, could, refer, to, either, side, of, the, boundary, thus, it, was, necessary, to, specify, part, of, it, with, borderline, or, borderland, during, the, medieval, period, the, government, s, control, frequently, diminished, the, further, people, got, from, the, capital, therefore, borderland, especially, impassable, terrain, attracted, many, outlaws, as, they, often, found, sympathizers, in, the, past, many, borders, were, not, clearly, defined, lines, instead, there, were, often, intervening, areas, often, claimed, and, fought, over, by, both, sides, sometimes, called, marchlands, special, cases, in, modern, times, were, the, saudi, arabian, iraqi, neutral, zone, from, 1922, to, 1991, and, the, saudi, arabian, kuwaiti, neutral, zone, from, 1922, until, 1970, in, modern, times, marchlands, have, been, replaced, by, clearly, defined, and, demarcated, borders, political, borders, are, imposed, on, the, world, through, human, agency, that, means, that, although, a, political, border, may, follow, a, river, or, mountain, range, such, a, feature, does, not, automatically, define, the, political, border, even, though, it, may, be, a, major, physical, barrier, to, crossing, political, borders, are, often, classified, by, whether, or, not, they, follow, conspicuous, physical, features, on, the, earth, william, miles, said, that, britain, and, france, traced, close, to, 40, of, the, entire, length, of, the, world, s, international, boundaries, natural, borders, are, geographical, features, that, present, natural, obstacles, to, communication, and, transport, existing, political, borders, are, often, a, formalization, of, such, historical, natural, obstacles, some, geographical, features, that, often, constitute, natural, borders, are, throughout, history, technological, advances, have, reduced, the, costs, of, transport, and, communication, across, the, natural, borders, that, has, reduced, the, significance, of, natural, borders, over, time, as, a, result, political, borders, that, have, been, formalized, more, recently, such, as, those, in, africa, or, americas, typically, conform, less, to, natural, borders, than, very, old, borders, such, as, those, in, europe, or, asia, do, a, landscape, border, is, a, mixture, of, political, and, natural, borders, one, example, is, the, defensive, forest, created, by, china, s, song, dynasty, in, the, eleventh, century, such, a, border, is, political, in, the, sense, that, it, is, human, demarcated, usually, through, a, treaty, however, a, landscape, border, is, not, demarcated, by, fences, and, walls, but, instead, landscape, features, such, as, forests, mountains, and, water, bodies, it, is, different, from, a, natural, border, however, in, the, sense, that, the, border, landscape, is, not, natural, but, human, engineered, such, a, landscape, usually, differs, from, the, borderland, s, natural, geography, and, its, building, requires, tremendous, human, labour, and, financial, investment, geometric, boundaries, are, formed, by, straight, lines, such, as, lines, of, latitude, or, longitude, or, occasionally, arcs, pennsylvania, delaware, regardless, of, the, physical, and, cultural, features, of, the, area, such, political, boundaries, are, often, found, around, the, states, that, developed, out, of, colonial, holdings, such, as, in, north, america, africa, and, the, middle, east, the, canada, united, states, border, follows, the, 49th, parallel, for, roughly, 2, 175, miles, 3, 500, km, from, lake, of, the, woods, ontario, and, minnesota, west, to, the, pacific, ocean, a, generalization, of, the, idea, of, geometric, borders, is, the, idea, of, fiat, boundaries, by, which, is, meant, any, sort, of, boundary, that, does, not, track, an, underlying, bona, fide, physical, discontinuity, fiat, latin, for, let, it, be, done, a, decision, fiat, boundaries, are, typically, the, product, of, human, demarcation, such, as, in, demarcating, electoral, districts, or, postal, districts, a, relic, border, is, a, former, boundary, which, may, no, longer, be, a, legal, boundary, at, all, however, the, former, presence, of, the, boundary, can, still, be, seen, in, the, landscape, for, instance, the, boundary, between, east, and, west, germany, is, no, longer, an, international, boundary, but, it, can, still, be, seen, because, of, historical, markers, on, the, landscape, it, remains, a, cultural, and, economic, demarcation, in, germany, other, examples, include, the, demilitarized, zone, between, north, and, south, vietnam, defunct, since, 1975, and, the, border, between, north, and, south, yemen, defunct, since, 1990, occasionally, a, relic, border, is, reconstituted, in, some, form, for, example, the, border, between, british, somaliland, and, italian, somaliland, ceased, to, exist, when, the, two, colonies, merged, to, form, the, independent, state, of, somalia, in, 1960, however, when, the, former, british, somaliland, declared, independence, in, 1991, it, claimed, the, former, british, italian, line, as, its, eastern, border, a, line, of, control, loc, refers, to, a, militarized, buffer, border, between, two, or, more, nations, that, has, yet, to, achieve, permanent, border, status, loc, borders, are, typically, under, military, control, and, are, not, recognized, as, an, official, international, border, formally, known, as, a, cease, fire, line, an, loc, was, first, created, with, the, simla, agreement, between, india, and, pakistan, similar, to, a, cease, fire, line, an, loc, is, typically, the, result, of, war, military, stalemates, and, unresolved, land, ownership, conflict, a, maritime, border, is, a, division, enclosing, an, area, in, the, ocean, where, a, nation, has, exclusive, rights, over, the, mineral, and, biological, resources, encompassing, maritime, features, limits, and, zones, maritime, borders, represent, the, jurisdictional, borders, of, a, maritime, nation, and, are, recognized, by, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, law, of, the, sea, maritime, borders, exist, in, the, context, of, territorial, waters, contiguous, zones, and, exclusive, economic, zones, however, the, terminology, does, not, encompass, lake, or, river, boundaries, which, are, considered, within, the, context, of, land, boundaries, some, maritime, borders, have, remained, indeterminate, despite, efforts, to, clarify, them, this, is, explained, by, an, array, of, factors, some, of, which, illustrate, regional, problems, airspace, is, the, atmosphere, located, within, a, country, s, controlled, international, and, maritime, borders, all, sovereign, countries, hold, the, right, to, regulate, and, protect, air, space, under, the, international, law, of, air, sovereignty, the, horizontal, boundaries, of, airspace, are, similar, to, the, policies, of, high, seas, in, maritime, law, airspace, extends, 12, nautical, miles, from, the, coast, of, a, country, and, it, holds, responsibility, for, protecting, its, own, airspace, unless, under, nato, peacetime, protection, with, international, agreement, a, country, can, assume, the, responsibility, of, protecting, or, controlling, the, atmosphere, over, international, airspaces, such, as, the, pacific, ocean, the, vertical, boundaries, of, airspace, are, not, officially, set, or, regulated, internationally, however, there, is, a, general, agreement, of, vertical, airspace, ending, at, the, point, of, the, k, rm, n, line, the, k, rm, n, line, is, a, peak, point, at, the, altitude, of, 62, mi, 100, km, above, the, earth, s, surface, setting, a, boundary, between, the, atmosphere, airspace, and, outer, space, which, is, governed, by, space, law, the, frontier, is, a, border, that, is, open, ended, to, one, side, identifying, an, expanding, borderland, to, one, side, this, type, of, border, can, be, fairly, abstract, and, has, been, identified, as, a, particular, state, of, mind, for, human, activity, as, such, frontiers, have, been, applied, to, borderlands, identifying, and, claiming, them, as, terra, nullius, such, as, marie, byrd, land, in, west, antarctica, the, only, territory, in, antarctica, unclaimed, by, any, sovereign, nation, regulated, borders, have, varying, degrees, of, control, on, the, movement, of, persons, and, trade, between, nations, and, jurisdictions, most, industrialized, nations, have, regulations, on, entry, and, require, one, or, more, of, the, following, procedures, visa, check, passport, check, or, customs, checks, most, regulated, borders, have, regulations, on, immigration, types, of, wildlife, and, plants, and, illegal, objects, such, as, drugs, or, weapons, overall, border, regulations, are, placed, by, national, and, local, governments, and, can, vary, depending, on, nation, and, current, political, or, economic, conditions, some, of, the, most, regulated, borders, in, the, world, include, australia, the, united, states, israel, canada, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, arab, emirates, these, nations, have, government, controlled, border, agencies, and, organizations, that, enforce, border, regulation, policies, on, and, within, their, borders, an, open, border, is, the, deregulation, and, or, lack, of, regulation, on, the, movement, of, persons, between, nations, and, jurisdictions, this, definition, does, not, apply, to, trade, or, movement, between, privately, owned, land, areas, most, nations, have, open, borders, for, travel, within, their, nation, of, travel, though, more, authoritarian, states, may, limit, the, freedom, of, internal, movement, of, its, citizens, as, for, example, in, the, former, ussr, however, only, a, handful, of, nations, have, deregulated, open, borders, with, other, nations, an, example, of, this, being, european, countries, under, the, schengen, agreement, or, the, open, belarus, russia, border, open, borders, used, to, be, very, common, amongst, all, nations, however, this, became, less, common, after, the, first, world, war, which, led, to, the, regulation, of, open, borders, making, them, less, common, and, no, longer, feasible, for, most, industrialized, nations, a, demilitarized, zone, dmz, is, a, border, separating, two, or, more, nations, groups, or, militaries, that, have, agreed, to, prohibit, the, use, of, military, activity, or, force, within, the, border, s, bounds, a, dmz, can, act, as, a, war, boundary, ceasefire, line, wildlife, preserve, or, a, de, facto, international, border, an, example, of, a, demilitarized, international, border, is, the, 38th, parallel, between, north, and, south, korea, other, notable, dmz, zones, include, antarctica, and, outer, space, consisting, of, all, space, 100, miles, away, from, the, earth, s, surface, both, are, preserved, for, world, research, and, exploration, the, prohibition, of, control, by, nations, can, make, a, dmz, unexposed, to, human, influence, and, thus, developed, into, a, natural, border, or, wildlife, preserve, such, as, on, the, korean, demilitarized, zone, the, vietnamese, demilitarized, zone, and, the, green, line, in, cyprus, borders, undermine, economic, activity, and, development, by, reducing, trade, activity, the, presence, of, borders, often, fosters, certain, economic, features, or, anomalies, wherever, two, jurisdictions, come, into, contact, special, economic, opportunities, arise, for, border, trade, smuggling, provides, a, classic, case, contrariwise, a, border, region, may, flourish, on, the, provision, of, excise, or, of, import, export, services, legal, or, quasi, legal, corrupt, or, legitimate, different, regulations, on, either, side, of, a, border, may, encourage, services, to, position, themselves, at, or, near, that, border, thus, the, provision, of, pornography, of, prostitution, of, alcohol, fireworks, and, or, of, narcotics, may, cluster, around, borders, city, limits, county, lines, ports, and, airports, in, a, more, planned, and, official, context, special, economic, zones, sezs, often, tend, to, cluster, near, borders, or, ports, even, if, the, goods, are, not, perceived, to, be, undesirable, states, will, still, seek, to, document, and, regulate, the, cross, border, trade, in, order, to, collect, tariffs, and, benefit, from, foreign, currency, exchange, revenues, thus, there, is, the, concept, unofficial, trade, in, goods, otherwise, legal, for, example, the, cross, border, trade, in, livestock, by, pastoralists, in, the, horn, of, africa, ethiopia, sells, an, estimated, 250, to, 300, million, of, livestock, to, somalia, kenya, and, djibouti, every, year, unofficially, over, 100, times, the, official, estimate, human, economic, traffic, across, borders, apart, from, kidnapping, may, involve, mass, commuting, between, workplaces, and, residential, settlements, the, removal, of, internal, barriers, to, commerce, as, in, france, after, the, french, revolution, or, in, europe, since, the, 1940s, de, emphasizes, border, based, economic, activity, and, fosters, free, trade, euroregions, are, similar, official, structures, built, around, commuting, across, boundary, political, borders, have, a, variety, of, meanings, for, those, whom, they, affect, many, borders, in, the, world, have, checkpoints, where, border, control, agents, inspect, persons, and, or, goods, crossing, the, boundary, in, much, of, europe, controls, on, persons, were, abolished, by, the, 1985, schengen, agreement, and, subsequent, european, union, legislation, since, the, treaty, of, amsterdam, the, competence, to, pass, laws, on, crossing, internal, and, external, borders, within, the, european, union, and, the, associated, schengen, area, states, iceland, norway, switzerland, and, liechtenstein, lies, exclusively, within, the, jurisdiction, of, the, european, union, except, where, states, have, used, a, specific, right, to, opt, out, united, kingdom, and, ireland, which, maintain, the, common, travel, area, amongst, themselves, the, united, states, has, notably, increased, measures, taken, in, border, control, on, the, canada, united, states, border, and, the, united, states, mexico, border, during, its, war, on, terrorism, see, shantz, 2010, one, american, writer, has, said, that, the, 3, 600, km, 2, 200, mi, us, mexico, border, is, probably, the, world, s, longest, boundary, between, a, first, world, and, third, world, country, historic, borders, such, as, the, great, wall, of, china, the, maginot, line, and, hadrian, s, wall, have, played, a, great, many, roles, and, been, marked, in, different, ways, while, the, stone, walls, the, great, wall, of, china, and, the, roman, hadrian, s, wall, in, britain, had, military, functions, the, entirety, of, the, roman, borders, were, very, porous, which, encouraged, roman, economic, activity, with, neighbors, on, the, other, hand, a, border, like, the, maginot, line, was, entirely, military, and, was, meant, to, prevent, any, access, in, what, was, to, be, world, war, ii, to, france, by, its, neighbor, germany, germany, ended, up, going, around, the, maginot, line, through, belgium, just, as, it, had, done, in, world, war, i, border, conflicts, or, the, potential, of, such, are, the, reason, why, many, borders, feature, fortifications, and, zoning, like, no, man, s, lands, demilitarized, zones, demarcation, lines, and, buffer, zones, examples, of, border, conflicts, include, skirmishes, and, wars, such, as, 38th, parallel, between, north, and, south, korea, western, sahara, conflict, kashmir, region, between, india, and, pakistan, etc, borders, have, sometimes, been, significantly, shaped, by, physical, border, constructions, and, openings, from, border, crossings, over, border, markers, to, border, barriers, these, constructions, fulfill, many, different, functions, such, as, also, providing, crossover, even, the, most, fortified, borders, reserve, specific, places, to, allow, crossing, the, many, forms, of, borders, have, different, ways, of, enabling, and, controlling, passage, borders, can, have, an, significant, impact, on, and, function, for, movement, it, can, enable, and, stop, movement, across, as, well, as, along, borders, the, permeability, of, borders, depends, on, its, construction, availability, of, crossings, regulation, and, types, or, scope, of, activity, the, permeability, can, vary, borders, can, be, barriers, for, humans, but, also, for, animal, migration, or, types, of, pollution, borders, facilitate, or, block, hybrids, like, border, overlap, and, cooperation, beyond, mere, encounter, and, exchange, macro, regional, integration, initiatives, such, as, the, european, union, and, nafta, have, spurred, the, establishment, of, cross, border, regions, these, are, initiatives, driven, by, local, or, regional, authorities, aimed, at, dealing, with, local, border, transcending, problems, such, as, transport, and, environmental, degradation, many, cross, border, regions, are, also, active, in, encouraging, intercultural, communication, and, dialogue, as, well, as, cross, border, economic, development, strategies, in, europe, the, european, union, provides, financial, support, to, cross, border, regions, via, its, interreg, programme, the, council, of, europe, has, issued, the, outline, convention, on, transfrontier, co, operation, providing, a, legal, framework, for, cross, border, co, operation, even, though, it, is, in, practice, rarely, used, by, euroregions, there, has, been, a, renaissance, in, the, study, of, borders, starting, with, the, end, of, the, 1990s, partially, from, the, creation, of, a, counter, narrative, to, the, discourse, about, the, world, becoming, a, borderless, and, deterritorialized, place, which, has, accompanied, theories, about, globalization, examples, of, recent, initiatives, are, the, border, regions, in, transition, network, of, scholars, the, international, boundaries, research, unit, at, the, university, of, durham, the, association, for, borderlands, studies, based, in, north, america, the, african, borderlands, research, network, and, the, founding, of, smaller, border, research, centres, at, nijmegen, and, queen, s, university, belfast, border, art, is, a, contemporary, art, practice, rooted, in, the, socio, political, experience, s, such, as, of, those, on, the, u, s, mexico, borderlands, or, frontera, since, its, conception, in, the, mid, 80, s, this, artistic, practice, has, assisted, in, the, development, of, questions, surrounding, homeland, borders, surveillance, identity, race, ethnicity, and, national, origin, s, border, art, as, a, conceptual, artistic, practice, however, opens, up, the, possibility, for, artists, to, explore, similar, concerns, of, identity, and, national, origin, s, but, whose, location, is, not, specific, to, the, u, s, mexico, border, a, border, can, be, a, division, dividing, groups, of, people, and, families, borders, can, include, but, are, not, limited, to, language, culture, social, and, economic, class, religion, and, national, identity, in, addition, to, a, division, a, border, can, also, conceive, a, borderland, area, that, can, create, a, cohesive, community, separate, from, the, mainstream, cultures, and, identities, portrayed, in, the, communities, away, from, the, borders, such, as, the, tijuana, san, diego, border, between, mexico, and, the, united, states, border, art, can, be, defined, as, an, art, that, is, created, in, reference, to, any, number, of, physical, or, imagined, boundaries, this, art, can, but, is, not, limited, to, social, political, physical, emotional, and, or, nationalist, issues, border, art, is, not, confined, to, one, particular, medium, border, art, artists, often, address, the, forced, politicization, of, human, bodies, and, physical, land, and, the, arbitrary, yet, incredibly, harmful, separations, that, are, created, by, these, borders, and, boundaries, these, artists, are, often, border, crossers, themselves, they, may, cross, borders, of, traditional, art, making, through, performance, video, or, a, combination, of, mediums, they, may, at, once, be, artists, and, activists, existing, in, multiple, social, roles, at, once, many, border, artists, defy, easy, classifications, in, their, artistic, practice, and, work, the, following, pictures, show, in, how, many, different, ways, international, and, regional, borders, can, be, closed, off, monitored, at, least, marked, as, such, or, simply, unremarkable, media, related, to, borders, at, wikimedia, commons
