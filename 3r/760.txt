typical, village, had, a, pub, or, inn, shops, and, a, blacksmith, but, many, of, these, facilities, are, now, gone, and, many, villages, are, dormitories, for, commuters, the, population, of, such, settlements, ranges, from, a, few, hundred, people, to, around, five, thousand, a, village, is, distinguished, from, a, town, in, that, like, france, villages, in, lebanon, are, usually, located, in, remote, mountainous, areas, the, majority, of, villages, in, lebanon, retain, their, aramaic, names, or, are, derivative, of, the, aramaic, names, and, this, is, because, aramaic, was, still, in, use, in, mount, lebanon, up, to, the, 18th, century, many, of, the, lebanese, villages, are, a, part, of, districts, these, districts, are, known, as, kadaa, which, includes, the, districts, of, baabda,

loula, sednaya, and, brad, mar, maroun, s, time, the, diversity, of, the, syrian, environments, creates, significant, differences, between, the, syrian, villages, in, terms, of, the, economic,

uruguay, village, or, villa, is, one, of, the, three, levels, at, which, the, government, classifies, urbanizations, or, localidades, a, villa, is, highest, rank, than, a, pueblo, which, is, the, lowest, unit, and, lower, than, a, city, or, ciudad, which, is, the, highest, rank, this, organization, is, more, related, with, notability, than, size, since, there, is, no, official, criteria, to, determine, the, level, of, urbanization, every, urbanization, is, a, pueblo, unless, is, elevated, by, decree, to, the, next, category, historically, this, was, a, faculty, of, the, executive, power, but, more, recently, this, faculty, was, transferred, to, the, legislative, however, colloquial, speech, still, refers, as, pueblo, to, most, villas, and, even, cities, and, many, names, preceded, by,

states, today, is, largely, disconnected, from, its, rural, and, communal, origins, the, situation, is, different, in, mexico, because, of, its, large, bulk, of, indigenous, population, living, in, traditional, villages, it, is, believed, that, the, name, canada, may, be, a, transliteration, of, the, iroquoisan, word, for, village, jacques, cartier, was, given, directions, to, the, kanata, of,

incorporated, municipal, government, similar, to, a, city, but, with, less, authority, and, geographic, scope, however, this, is, a, generality, in, many, states, there, are, villages, that, are, an, order, of, magnitude, larger, than, the, smallest, cities, in, the, state, the, distinction, is, not, necessarily, based, on, population, but, on, the, relative, powers, granted, to, the, different, types, of, municipalities, and, correspondingly, different, obligations, to, provide, specific, services, to, residents, in, some, states, such, as, new, york, and, michigan, a, village, is, an, incorporated, municipality, within, a, single, town, or, civil, township, in, some, cases, the, village, may, be, coterminous, with, the, town, or, township, in, which, case, the, two, may, have, a, consolidated, government, there, are, also, villages, that, span, the, boundaries, of, more, than, one, town, or, township, some, villages, may, straddle, county, borders, there, is, no, population, limit, to, villages, in, new, york, hempstead, the, largest, village, has, 55, 000, residents, making, it, more, populous, than, some, of, the, state, s, cities, however, villages, in, the, state, may, not, exceed, five, square, miles, 13, km, 2, in, area, michigan, and, illinois, also, have, no, set, population, limit, for, villages, and, there, are, many, villages, that, are, larger, than, cities, in, those, states, the, village, of, schaumburg, illinois, had, 78, 723, residents, as, of, the, 2020, census, a, village, also, has, no, written, figure, against, how, small, a, population, can, be, with, the, united, states, smallest, incorporated, village, being, dering, harbor, ny, with, a, population, of, just, over, 10, in, michigan, a, village, is, always, legally, part, of, a, township, villages, can, incorporate, land, in, multiple, townships, and, even, multiple, counties, the, largest, village, in, the, state, is, beverly, hills, in, southfield, township, which, had, a,

district, an, example, of, the, latter, is, the, village, of, friendship, heights, in, north, carolina, the, only, difference, between, cities, towns, and, villages, is, the, term, itself, in, many, states, the, term, village, is, used, to, refer, to, a, relatively, small, unincorporated, community, similar, to, a, hamlet, in, new, york, state, this, informal, usage, may, be, found, even, in, states, that, have, villages, as, an, incorporated, municipality, although, such, usage, might, be, considered, incorrect, and, confusing, in, most, new, england, states, a, village, is, a, center, of, population, or, trade, including, the, town, center, in, an, otherwise, sparsely, developed, town, or, city, for, instance, the, village, of, hyannis, in, the, town, of, barnstable, massachusetts, however, in, vermont, and, connecticut, both, incorporated, and, unincorporated, villages, exist, villages, in, nigeria, vary, significantly, because, of, cultural, and, geographical, differences, northern, nigeria, in, the, north, villages, were, under, traditional, rulers, long, before, the, jihad, of, shaikh, uthman, bin, fodio, and, after, the, holy, war, at, that, time, traditional, rulers, used, to, have, absolute, power, in, their, administrative, regions, after, dan, fodio, s, jihad, in, 1804, political, structure, of, the, north, became, islamic, where, emirs, were, the, political, administrative, and, spiritual, leaders, of, their, people, these, emirs, appointed, a, number, of, people, to, assist, them, in, running, the, administration, and, that, included, villages, every, hausa, village, was, reigned, by, magaji, village, head, who, was, answerable, to, his, hakimi, mayor, at, the, town, level, the, magaji, also, had, his, cabinet, who, assisted, him, in, ruling, his, village, efficiently, among, whom, was, mai, unguwa, ward, head, with, the, creation, of, native, authority, in, nigerian, provinces, the, autocratic, power, of, village, heads, along, with, all, other, traditional, rulers, was, subdued, hence, they, ruled, under, the, guidance, of, colonial, officials, even, though, the, constitution, of, the, federal, republic, of, nigeria, has, not, recognised, the, functions, of, traditional, rulers, they, still, command, respect, in, their, villages, and, political, office, holders, liaise, with, them, almost, every, time, to, reach, people, in, hausa, language, village, is, called, auye, and, every, local, government, area, is, made, up, of, several, small, and, large, auyuka, villages, for, instance, girka, is, a, village, in, kaita, town, in, katsina, state, in, nigeria, they, have, mud, houses, with, thatched, roofing, though, like, in, most, of, the, villages, in, the, north, zinc, roofing, has, become, a, common, sight, still, in, many, villages, in, the, north, people, do, not, have, access, to, potable, water, so, they, fetch, water, from, ponds, and, streams, others, are, lucky, to, have, wells, within, a, walking, distance, women, rush, in, the, morning, to, fetch, water, in, their, clay, pots, from, wells, boreholes, and, streams, however, the, government, is, now, providing, them, with, water, bore, holes, electricity, and, gsm, network, are, reaching, more, and, more, villages, in, the, north, almost, every, day, so, bad, feeder, roads, may, lead, to, remote, villages, with, electricity, and, unstable, gsm, network, southern, nigeria, village, dwellers, in, the, southeastern, region, lived, separately, in, clusters, of, huts, belonging, to, the, patrilinage, as, the, rainforest, region,
