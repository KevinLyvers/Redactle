lake, maracaibo, spanish, lago, de, maracaibo, is, a, brackish, lake, located, in, northwestern, venezuela, between, the, states, of, zulia, trujillo, and, m, rida, hydrologically, it, is, a, semi, enclosed, bay, off, the, coast, of, the, gulf, of, venezuela, lake, maracaibo, is, commonly, considered, a, lake, though, due, to, its, current, geological, characteristics, it, should, not, be, considered, as, such, with, a, surface, area, of, 13, 512, km, 2, 5, 217, sq, mi, it, is, the, largest, lake, in, south, america, and, one, of, the, oldest, on, earth, having, formed, disputably, as, a, lake, 36, million, years, ago, in, the, andes, mountains, the, lake, is, connected, to, the, gulf, of, venezuela, to, the, north, by, a, narrow, spit, it, is, fed, by, numerous, rivers, the, biggest, being, the, catatumbo, river, the, fault, in, the, northern, section, has, collapsed, and, is, rich, in, oil, and, gas, resources, it, is, venezuela, s, main, oil, producing, area, and, an, important, fishing, and, agricultural, producing, area, eutrophication, caused, by, oil, pollution, is, a, major, environmental, problem, facing, the, lagoon, the, area, around, the, lagoon, is, inhabited, by, a, quarter, of, the, country, s, population, and, is, also, the, place, with, the, most, frequent, lightning, on, earth, the, famous, catatumbo, lightning, can, illuminate, nighttime, navigation, lake, maracaibo, is, located, within, the, eponymous, basin, and, is, one, of, the, oldest, lakes, on, earth, it, was, formed, 36, million, years, ago, when, the, faults, collapsed, when, the, andes, were, uplifted, in, the, late, eocene, in, the, geological, history, sea, water, and, fresh, water, have, alternated, many, times, and, have, flooded, the, area, at, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, the, sea, level, rose, connecting, lake, maracaibo, directly, with, the, atlantic, ocean, and, the, lighter, fresh, water, floated, on, the, heavier, salt, water, causing, nutrients, to, be, deposited, on, the, bottom, of, the, lake, resulting, in, the, accumulation, of, more, than, a, five, kilometer, thick, deposit, of, sediment, on, the, bedrock, in, the, pliocene, the, depression, of, today, s, lake, maracaibo, reached, what, would, be, practically, its, current, form, the, numerous, rivers, that, flow, into, the, lake, have, been, defining, its, banks, especially, those, that, form, the, southern, delta, of, the, lake, where, the, escalante, catatumbo, and, santa, ana, rivers, converge, lake, maracaibo, is, located, in, the, maracaibo, lowland, in, the, faulted, basin, between, the, perija, mountains, and, the, merida, mountains, of, the, eastern, cordillera, mountains, in, northwestern, venezuela, the, lake, is, in, the, shape, of, a, vase, it, is, 210, kilometers, long, from, north, to, south, 121, kilometers, wide, from, east, to, west, covers, an, area, of, 13, 512, square, kilometers, the, deepest, is, 35, meters, the, shore, length, is, about, 1000, kilometers, and, the, volume, is, about, 280, cubic, kilometers, the, largest, river, entering, the, lake, the, catatumbo, river, enters, the, lake, from, west, to, east, providing, 57, of, the, water, entering, the, lake, in, addition, to, the, influence, of, the, prevailing, wind, the, lake, water, circulates, counterclockwise, there, are, also, the, santa, ana, river, chama, river, motat, n, river, escalante, river, and, about, fifty, other, rivers, which, drain, into, it, lake, maracaibo, is, deep, in, the, south, and, shallow, in, the, north, the, northern, half, of, the, lake, which, looks, like, a, bottleneck, is, 55, kilometers, long, the, southeastern, edge, of, the, lake, basin, with, a, flat, bottom, is, steep, and, the, northwestern, edge, is, gentle, it, is, slightly, salty, due, to, the, influence, of, tides, and, the, overall, salinity, is, between, 1, 5, and, 3, 8, the, catatumbo, river, forms, a, bird, foot, shaped, delta, in, the, southwest, of, the, lake, basin, and, the, surface, lake, water, in, the, delta, has, a, salinity, of, only, 0, 13, however, the, intrusion, of, seawater, from, the, mouth, of, the, lake, makes, the, salinity, of, the, bottom, lake, water, higher, reaching, 0, 2, 0, 3, the, north, is, connected, with, the, gulf, of, venezuela, and, the, spit, at, the, mouth, of, the, lake, extends, for, about, 26, kilometers, the, annual, average, temperature, of, the, lake, area, is, 28, c, the, precipitation, is, more, in, the, south, and, less, in, the, north, and, the, average, annual, rainfall, in, the, south, is, 1400, mm, the, mountain, wind, from, the, andes, at, night, contacts, the, warm, and, humid, air, on, the, lake, surface, forming, an, average, of, 297, mm, per, year, the, meteorological, phenomenon, known, as, catatumbo, lightning, takes, place, in, southern, part, of, the, lake, characterized, by, a, continuous, series, of, lightnings, that, are, almost, continuous, and, silent, this, makes, lake, maracaibo, the, place, with, the, most, frequent, lightning, on, earth, there, are, about, 233, lightning, strikes, per, square, kilometer, in, a, year, on, average, the, nocturnal, thunderstorms, occur, on, average, about, 297, days, per, year, at, its, peak, in, september, the, lake, area, can, experience, up, to, 280, lightning, strikes, per, hour, approximately, 28, lightning, strikes, per, minute, lasting, up, to, 9, hours, and, is, capable, of, illuminating, nighttime, navigation, the, aboriginal, a, people, who, lived, on, the, banks, of, the, lake, refer, to, it, as, coquivacoa, the, tribes, of, wayuu, caquet, os, and, quiriquires, also, lived, in, the, area, when, italian, navigator, amerigo, vespucci, and, spanish, explorer, alonso, de, ojeda, s, fleet, sailed, here, on, august, 24, 1499, the, first, time, europeans, entered, this, area, the, stilt, houses, in, which, the, a, lived, in, reminded, vespucci, of, the, italian, city, of, venice, so, he, named, the, region, veneziola, venezuela, in, spanish, or, little, venice, spain, made, two, attempts, to, establish, settlements, around, the, lake, in, 1529, and, 1569, but, it, was, not, until, 1574, that, the, city, of, maracaibo, was, successfully, established, the, privateer, henry, morgan, raided, settlements, on, the, lake, in, the, spring, of, 1669, and, defeated, a, spanish, squadron, sent, to, intercept, him, on, july, 24, 1823, venezuela, won, the, famous, battle, of, lake, maracaibo, on, the, lake, during, the, venezuelan, war, of, independence, the, original, depth, of, the, lake, mouth, which, was, only, more, than, 4, meters, deep, was, increased, to, 8, meters, after, dredging, in, the, 1930s, and, the, 3, kilometer, long, stone, breakwater, was, further, increased, to, 11, meters, after, its, completion, in, 1957, allowing, ocean, going, tankers, to, enter, the, lake, at, the, same, time, the, northern, part, which, was, originally, fresh, water, became, brackish, the, 8, 678, meter, general, rafael, urdaneta, bridge, over, the, lake, connecting, maracaibo, and, santa, rita, was, completed, in, 1962, lake, maracaibo, is, rich, in, oil, and, gas, resources, and, is, known, as, the, oil, lake, the, first, spaniards, who, arrived, used, tar, seeping, from, the, lake, to, fill, ship, cracks, the, maracaibo, oil, field, was, discovered, in, 1914, the, first, oil, well, was, constructed, in, 1917, and, large, scale, exploitation, began, in, 1922, the, oil, fields, are, concentrated, in, the, northeast, and, northwest, of, the, lake, and, the, oil, producing, layers, are, mainly, tertiary, sandstone, and, cretaceous, limestone, with, a, hydrocarbon, bearing, area, of, 1, 300, square, kilometers, mainly, concentrated, in, the, coastal, waters, 105, kilometers, long, and, 32, kilometers, wide, in, the, east, of, the, lake, maracaibo, on, the, northwest, coast, is, the, capital, of, zulia, state, the, second, largest, city, in, venezuela, and, an, important, oil, export, port, in, the, world, the, lake, area, is, also, an, important, fishing, and, agricultural, production, area, in, venezuela, supporting, more, than, 20, 000, fishermen, many, of, whom, live, in, colorful, traditional, stilt, houses, built, with, iron, sheets, on, the, lake, the, main, crops, on, the, south, bank, of, the, lake, are, bananas, peanuts, cocoa, coconut, sugar, cane, and, coffee, the, western, shore, of, the, lake, developed, dairy, industry, lake, maracaibo, and, the, catatumbo, river, are, the, main, traffic, lines, for, the, transportation, of, commodities, in, the, nearby, area, and, the, city, of, maracaibo, is, the, transshipment, center, of, coffee, produced, in, the, andes, the, waterway, can, pass, through, large, sea, going, ships, and, oil, tankers, exporting, crude, oil, and, agricultural, and, livestock, products, from, the, andean, mountains, and, lakes, the, lake, district, is, home, to, a, quarter, of, venezuela, s, population, and, with, the, influx, of, farmers, from, the, nearby, andes, the, population, of, the, lake, district, increased, from, about, 300, 000, in, 1936, to, over, 3, 62, million, in, 2007, lake, maracaibo, possesses, highly, oxygenated, waters, which, makes, it, rich, in, algae, and, in, turn, fish, making, it, very, biologically, diverse, it, is, home, to, clams, blue, crabs, shrimp, and, other, aquatic, products, and, is, also, home, to, two, endangered, aquatic, mammals, the, west, indian, manatee, and, the, amazon, river, dolphin, about, 145, species, of, fish, inhabit, the, lake, including, many, endemic, species, such, as, the, maracaibo, half, hooked, catfish, hypostomus, maracaiboensis, the, maracaibo, hairy, catfish, trichomycterus, maracaiboensis, the, maracaibo, lake, lamont, catfish, lamontichthys, maracaibero, lake, maracaibo, tetra, bryconamericus, motatanensis, and, maracaibo, wolf, anchovies, lycengraulis, limnichthys, living, in, surface, waters, the, lake, has, been, drilled, about, 14, 000, times, and, more, than, 15, 000, miles, of, oil, and, gas, pipelines, criss, cross, the, lake, floor, but, most, of, these, pipelines, are, half, a, century, old, with, oil, leaking, from, many, aging, underwater, pipes, before, the, 1950s, the, lake, water, could, still, be, used, directly, for, domestic, use, but, then, due, to, the, intrusion, of, tidal, salt, water, caused, by, the, widening, of, the, lake, mouth, channel, the, salinity, of, the, northern, lake, area, increased, by, about, 1, 000, and, the, south, also, increased, by, 300, 500, in, lakeside, towns, such, as, the, city, of, maracaibo, the, lake, water, is, contaminated, with, e, coli, from, feces, oil, pollution, and, eutrophication, caused, by, agricultural, sewage, discharged, into, the, lake, as, well, as, domestic, and, industrial, wastewater, resulting, in, the, blooms, of, duckweed, and, green, algae, the, presence, of, large, amounts, of, duckweed, blocks, the, passage, of, sunlight, significantly, affecting, biological, cycles, preventing, the, development, of, native, algae, and, plant, species, additionally, duckweed, residues, accumulate, at, the, bottom, generating, a, layer, of, organic, elements, that, produces, large, amounts, of, ammonium, methane, and, other, compounds, whose, saturation, causes, eutrophication, of, the, waters, in, the, spring, of, 2004, heavy, rains, fell, in, the, lake, maracaibo, basin, causing, a, large, influx, of, fresh, water, into, the, lake, this, caused, nutrients, originally, deposited, on, the, bottom, of, the, lake, to, float, to, the, surface, of, the, lake, which, in, turn, allowed, the, duckweed, to, rapidly, multiply, and, triggered, a, bloom, that, lasted, for, up, to, eight, months, the, blooms, were, noted, in, june, to, have, covered, 18, of, the, lake, and, the, local, government, had, to, begin, spending, about, 2, million, per, month, on, cleanup, work, numerous, oil, spills, at, least, partly, attributed, to, deficient, maintenance, and, the, indiscriminate, discharge, of, sewage, without, prior, treatment, have, significantly, deteriorated, the, water, quality, to, the, point, that, in, some, parts, of, the, zulia, area, the, water, presents, levels, of, contamination, that, are, very, dangerous, for, health, within, the, existing, polluting, activities, the, mining, of, mineral, coal, has, started, more, recently, which, further, contaminates, the, basin, with, pollutants, likewise, the, so, called, ca, adas, which, are, random, drainage, courses, drag, large, amounts, of, garbage, from, the, human, settlements, that, are, in, their, path, to, the, lake, in, addition, to, this, residential, waste, such, as, plastic, bags, and, bottles, are, also, added, these, pollutants, all, eventually, get, carried, into, the, lake, there, are, many, islands, in, the, lake, some, primarily, consist, of, sedimentary, rock, such, as, the, zapata, pescadores, and, san, carlos, islands, which, is, geographically, a, peninsula, while, others, like, toad, have, tectonic, origins, the, majority, of, the, islands, are, located, in, the, area, of, the, tablazo, bay, and, forms, the, almirante, padilla, municipality, the, islands, of, burro, providencia, hijacal, p, jaros, and, the, artificial, islands, are, located, at, the, neck, of, the, lake, and, belong, to, other, municipalities, natural, islands, of, lake, maracaibo, artificial, islands, of, lake, maracaibo, the, 8, 678, metres, 28, 471, ft, long, general, rafael, urdaneta, bridge, connects, the, western, and, eastern, coast, of, the, lake, together, it, held, the, record, for, being, the, longest, cable, stayed, concrete, bridge, in, the, world, at, the, time, of, its, inauguration, in, 1962, located, in, the, southern, part, of, the, strait, of, maracaibo, it, is, a, vehicles, only, bridge, that, accommodates, both, directions, of, traffic, while, its, height, allows, for, the, passage, of, vessels, up, to, 45, meters, in, height
