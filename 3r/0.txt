geography, from, ancient, greek, ge, graph, a, combining, g, earth, and, gr, ph, write, is, the, study, of, the, lands, features, inhabitants, and, phenomena, of, earth, geography, is, an, all, encompassing, discipline, that, seeks, an, understanding, of, earth, and, its, human, and, natural, complexities, not, merely, where, objects, are, but, also, how, they, have, changed, and, come, to, be, while, geography, is, specific, to, earth, many, concepts, can, be, applied, more, broadly, to, other, celestial, bodies, in, the, field, of, planetary, science, geography, has, been, called, a, bridge, between, natural, science, and, social, science, disciplines, origins, of, many, of, the, concepts, in, geography, can, be, traced, to, greek, eratosthenes, of, cyrene, who, may, have, coined, the, term, geographia, c, 276, bc, c, 195, 194, bc, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, word, was, as, the, title, of, a, book, by, greek, scholar, claudius, ptolemy, 100, 170, ad, this, work, created, the, so, called, ptolemaic, tradition, of, geography, which, included, ptolemaic, cartographic, theory, however, the, concepts, of, geography, such, as, cartography, date, back, to, the, earliest, attempts, to, understand, the, world, spatially, with, the, earliest, example, of, an, attempted, world, map, dating, to, the, 9th, century, bce, in, ancient, babylon, the, history, of, geography, as, a, discipline, spans, cultures, and, millennia, being, independently, developed, by, multiple, groups, and, cross, pollinated, by, trade, between, these, groups, the, core, concepts, of, geography, consistent, between, all, approaches, are, a, focus, on, space, place, time, and, scale, today, geography, is, an, extremely, broad, discipline, with, multiple, approaches, and, modalities, there, have, been, multiple, attempts, to, organize, the, discipline, including, the, four, traditions, of, geography, and, into, branches, techniques, employed, can, generally, be, broken, down, into, quantitative, and, qualitative, approaches, with, many, studies, taking, mixed, methods, approaches, common, techniques, include, cartography, remote, sensing, interviews, and, surveying, geography, is, a, systematic, study, of, the, earth, other, celestial, bodies, are, specified, such, as, geography, of, mars, or, given, another, name, such, as, areography, in, the, case, of, mars, its, features, and, phenomena, that, take, place, on, it, for, something, to, fall, into, the, domain, of, geography, it, generally, needs, some, sort, of, spatial, component, that, can, be, placed, on, a, map, such, as, coordinates, place, names, or, addresses, this, has, led, to, geography, being, associated, with, cartography, and, place, names, although, many, geographers, are, trained, in, toponymy, and, cartology, this, is, not, their, main, preoccupation, geographers, study, the, earth, s, spatial, and, temporal, distribution, of, phenomena, processes, and, features, as, well, as, the, interaction, of, humans, and, their, environment, because, space, and, place, affect, a, variety, of, topics, such, as, economics, health, climate, plants, and, animals, geography, is, highly, interdisciplinary, the, interdisciplinary, nature, of, the, geographical, approach, depends, on, an, attentiveness, to, the, relationship, between, physical, and, human, phenomena, and, their, spatial, patterns, names, of, places, are, not, geography, to, know, by, heart, a, whole, gazetteer, full, of, them, would, not, in, itself, constitute, anyone, a, geographer, geography, has, higher, aims, than, this, it, seeks, to, classify, phenomena, alike, of, the, natural, and, of, the, political, world, in, so, far, as, it, treats, of, the, latter, to, compare, to, generalize, to, ascend, from, effects, to, causes, and, in, doing, so, to, trace, out, the, laws, of, nature, and, to, mark, their, influences, upon, man, this, is, a, description, of, the, world, that, is, geography, in, a, word, geography, is, a, science, a, thing, not, of, mere, names, but, of, argument, and, reason, of, cause, and, effect, geography, as, a, discipline, can, be, split, broadly, into, three, main, branches, human, geography, physical, geography, and, technical, geography, human, geography, largely, focuses, on, the, built, environment, and, how, humans, create, view, manage, and, influence, space, physical, geography, examines, the, natural, environment, and, how, organisms, climate, soil, water, and, landforms, produce, and, interact, the, difference, between, these, approaches, led, to, the, development, of, integrated, geography, which, combines, physical, and, human, geography, and, concerns, the, interactions, between, the, environment, and, humans, technical, geography, involves, studying, and, developing, the, tools, and, techniques, used, by, geographers, such, as, remote, sensing, cartography, and, geographic, information, system, narrowing, down, geography, to, a, few, key, concepts, is, extremely, challenging, and, subject, to, tremendous, debate, within, the, discipline, in, one, attempt, the, 1st, edition, of, the, book, key, concepts, in, geography, broke, down, this, into, chapters, focusing, on, space, place, time, scale, and, landscape, the, 2nd, edition, of, the, book, expanded, on, these, key, concepts, by, adding, environmental, systems, social, systems, nature, globalization, development, and, risk, demonstrating, how, challenging, narrowing, the, field, can, be, another, approach, used, extensively, in, teaching, geography, are, the, five, themes, of, geography, established, by, guidelines, for, geographic, education, elementary, and, secondary, schools, published, jointly, by, the, national, council, for, geographic, education, and, the, association, of, american, geographers, in, 1984, these, themes, are, location, place, relationships, within, places, often, summarized, as, human, environment, interaction, movement, and, regions, the, five, themes, of, geography, have, shaped, how, american, education, approaches, the, topic, in, the, years, since, just, as, all, phenomena, exist, in, time, and, thus, have, a, history, they, also, exist, in, space, and, have, a, geography, for, something, to, exist, in, the, realm, of, geography, it, must, be, able, to, be, described, spatially, thus, space, is, the, most, fundamental, concept, at, the, foundation, of, geography, the, concept, is, so, basic, that, geographers, often, have, difficulty, defining, exactly, what, it, is, absolute, space, is, the, exact, site, or, spatial, coordinates, of, objects, persons, places, or, phenomena, under, investigation, we, exist, in, space, absolute, space, leads, to, the, view, of, the, world, as, a, photograph, with, everything, frozen, in, place, when, the, coordinates, were, recorded, today, geographers, are, trained, to, recognize, the, world, as, a, dynamic, space, where, all, processes, interact, and, take, place, rather, than, a, static, image, on, a, map, place, is, one, of, the, most, complex, and, important, terms, in, geography, in, human, geography, place, is, the, synthesis, of, the, coordinates, on, the, earth, s, surface, the, activity, and, use, that, occurs, has, occurred, and, will, occur, at, the, coordinates, and, the, meaning, ascribed, to, the, space, by, human, individuals, and, groups, this, can, be, extraordinarily, complex, as, different, spaces, may, have, different, uses, at, different, times, and, mean, different, things, to, different, people, in, physical, geography, a, place, includes, all, of, the, physical, phenomena, that, occur, in, space, including, the, lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and, biosphere, places, do, not, exist, in, a, vacuum, and, instead, have, complex, spatial, relationships, with, each, other, and, place, is, concerned, how, a, location, is, situated, in, relation, to, all, other, locations, as, a, discipline, then, the, term, place, in, geography, includes, all, spatial, phenomena, occurring, at, a, location, the, diverse, uses, and, meanings, humans, ascribe, to, that, location, and, how, that, location, impacts, and, is, impacted, by, all, other, locations, on, earth, in, one, of, yi, fu, tuan, s, papers, he, explains, that, in, his, view, geography, is, the, study, of, earth, as, a, home, for, humanity, and, thus, place, and, the, complex, meaning, behind, the, term, is, central, to, the, discipline, of, geography, time, is, usually, thought, to, be, within, the, domain, of, history, however, it, is, of, significant, concern, in, the, discipline, of, geography, in, physics, space, and, time, are, not, separated, and, are, combined, into, the, concept, of, spacetime, geography, is, subject, to, the, laws, of, physics, and, in, studying, things, that, occur, in, space, time, must, be, considered, time, in, geography, is, more, than, just, the, historical, record, of, events, that, occurred, at, various, discrete, coordinates, but, also, includes, modeling, the, dynamic, movement, of, people, organisms, and, things, through, space, time, facilitates, movement, through, space, ultimately, allowing, things, to, flow, through, a, system, the, amount, of, time, an, individual, or, group, of, people, spends, in, a, place, will, often, shape, their, attachment, and, perspective, to, that, place, time, constrains, the, possible, paths, that, can, be, taken, through, space, given, a, starting, point, possible, routes, and, rate, of, travel, visualizing, time, over, space, is, challenging, in, terms, of, cartography, and, includes, space, prism, advanced, 3d, geovisualizations, and, animated, maps, scale, in, the, context, of, a, map, is, the, ratio, between, a, distance, measured, on, the, map, and, the, corresponding, distance, as, measured, on, the, ground, this, concept, is, fundamental, to, the, discipline, of, geography, not, just, cartography, in, that, phenomena, being, investigated, appear, different, depending, on, the, scale, used, scale, is, the, frame, that, geographers, use, to, measure, space, and, ultimately, to, try, and, understand, a, place, during, the, quantitative, revolution, geography, shifted, to, an, empirical, law, making, nomothetic, approach, several, laws, of, geography, have, been, proposed, since, then, most, notably, by, waldo, tobler, and, can, be, viewed, as, a, product, of, the, quantitative, revolution, in, general, some, dispute, the, entire, concept, of, laws, in, geography, and, the, social, sciences, these, criticisms, have, been, addressed, by, tobler, and, others, such, as, michael, frank, goodchild, however, this, is, an, ongoing, source, of, debate, in, geography, and, is, unlikely, to, be, resolved, anytime, soon, several, laws, have, been, proposed, and, tobler, s, first, law, of, geography, is, the, most, generally, accepted, in, geography, some, have, argued, that, geographic, laws, do, not, need, to, be, numbered, the, existence, of, a, first, invites, a, second, and, many, have, proposed, themselves, as, that, it, has, also, been, proposed, that, tobler, s, first, law, of, geography, should, be, moved, to, the, second, and, replaced, with, another, a, few, of, the, proposed, laws, of, geography, are, below, additionally, several, variations, or, amendments, to, these, laws, exist, within, the, literature, although, not, as, well, supported, for, example, one, paper, proposed, an, amended, version, of, tobler, s, first, law, of, geography, referred, to, in, the, text, as, the, tobler, von, th, nen, law, which, states, everything, is, related, to, everything, else, but, near, things, are, more, related, than, distant, things, as, a, consequence, of, accessibility, geography, is, a, branch, of, inquiry, that, focuses, on, spatial, information, on, earth, it, is, an, extremely, broad, topic, and, can, be, broken, down, multiple, ways, there, have, been, several, approaches, to, doing, this, spanning, at, least, several, centuries, including, four, traditions, of, geography, and, into, distinct, branches, the, four, traditions, of, geography, are, often, used, to, divide, the, different, historical, approach, theories, geographers, have, taken, to, the, discipline, in, contrast, geography, s, branches, describe, contemporary, applied, geographical, approaches, geography, is, an, extremely, broad, field, because, of, this, many, view, the, various, definitions, of, geography, proposed, over, the, decades, as, inadequate, to, address, this, william, d, pattison, proposed, the, concept, of, the, four, traditions, of, geography, in, 1964, these, traditions, are, the, spatial, or, locational, tradition, the, man, land, or, human, environment, interaction, tradition, sometimes, referred, to, as, integrated, geography, the, area, studies, or, regional, tradition, and, the, earth, science, tradition, these, concepts, are, broad, sets, of, geography, philosophies, bound, together, within, the, discipline, they, are, one, of, many, ways, geographers, organize, the, major, sets, of, thoughts, and, philosophies, within, the, discipline, in, another, approach, to, the, abovementioned, four, traditions, geography, is, organized, into, applied, branches, the, unesco, encyclopedia, of, life, support, systems, organizes, geography, into, the, three, categories, of, human, geography, physical, geography, and, technical, geography, some, publications, limit, the, number, of, branches, to, physical, and, human, describing, them, as, the, principal, branches, geographers, rarely, focus, on, just, one, of, these, topics, often, using, one, as, their, primary, focus, and, then, incorporating, data, and, methods, from, the, other, branches, often, geographers, are, asked, to, describe, what, they, do, by, individuals, outside, the, discipline, and, are, likely, to, identify, closely, with, a, specific, branch, or, sub, branch, when, describing, themselves, to, lay, people, human, geography, studies, people, and, their, communities, cultures, economies, and, environmental, interactions, by, studying, their, relations, with, and, across, space, and, place, physical, geography, is, concerned, with, the, study, of, processes, and, patterns, in, the, natural, environment, like, the, atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and, geosphere, technical, geography, is, interested, in, studying, and, applying, techniques, and, methods, to, store, process, analyze, visualize, and, use, spatial, data, it, is, the, newest, of, the, branches, the, most, controversial, and, often, other, terms, are, used, in, the, literature, to, describe, the, emerging, category, these, branches, use, similar, geographic, philosophies, concepts, and, tools, and, often, overlap, significantly, physical, geography, or, physiography, focuses, on, geography, as, an, earth, science, it, aims, to, understand, the, physical, problems, and, the, issues, of, lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, pedosphere, and, global, flora, and, fauna, patterns, biosphere, physical, geography, is, the, study, of, earth, s, seasons, climate, atmosphere, soil, streams, landforms, and, oceans, physical, geographers, will, often, work, in, identifying, and, monitoring, the, use, of, natural, resources, human, geography, or, anthropogeography, is, a, branch, of, geography, that, focuses, on, studying, patterns, and, processes, that, shape, human, society, it, encompasses, the, human, political, cultural, social, and, economic, aspects, in, industry, human, geographers, often, work, in, city, planning, public, health, or, business, analysis, various, approaches, to, the, study, of, human, geography, have, also, arisen, through, time, and, include, technical, geography, concerns, studying, and, developing, tools, techniques, and, statistical, methods, employed, to, collect, analyze, use, and, understand, spatial, data, technical, geography, is, the, most, recently, recognized, and, controversial, of, the, branches, its, use, dates, back, to, 1749, when, a, book, published, by, edward, cave, organized, the, discipline, into, a, section, containing, content, such, as, cartographic, techniques, and, globes, there, are, several, other, terms, often, used, interchangeably, with, technical, geography, to, subdivide, the, discipline, including, techniques, of, geographic, analysis, geographic, information, technology, geography, method, s, and, techniques, geographic, information, science, geoinformatics, geomatics, and, information, geography, there, are, subtle, differences, to, each, concept, and, term, however, technical, geography, is, one, of, the, broadest, is, consistent, with, the, naming, convention, of, the, other, two, branches, has, been, in, use, since, the, 1700s, and, has, been, used, by, the, unesco, encyclopedia, of, life, support, systems, to, divide, geography, into, themes, as, academic, fields, increasingly, specialize, in, their, nature, technical, geography, has, emerged, as, a, branch, of, geography, specializing, in, geographic, methods, and, thought, the, emergence, of, technical, geography, has, brought, new, relevance, to, the, broad, discipline, of, geography, by, serving, as, a, set, of, unique, methods, for, managing, the, interdisciplinary, nature, of, the, phenomena, under, investigation, while, human, and, physical, geographers, use, the, techniques, employed, by, technical, geographers, technical, geography, is, more, concerned, with, the, fundamental, spatial, concepts, and, technologies, than, the, nature, of, the, data, it, is, therefore, closely, associated, with, the, spatial, tradition, of, geography, while, being, applied, to, the, other, two, major, branches, a, technical, geographer, might, work, as, a, gis, analyst, a, gis, developer, working, to, make, new, software, tools, or, create, general, reference, maps, incorporating, human, and, natural, features, all, geographic, research, and, analysis, start, with, asking, the, question, where, followed, by, why, there, geographers, start, with, the, fundamental, assumption, set, forth, in, tobler, s, first, law, of, geography, that, everything, is, related, to, everything, else, but, near, things, are, more, related, than, distant, things, as, spatial, interrelationships, are, key, to, this, synoptic, science, maps, are, a, key, tool, classical, cartography, has, been, joined, by, a, more, modern, approach, to, geographical, analysis, computer, based, geographic, information, systems, gis, in, their, study, geographers, use, four, interrelated, approaches, quantitative, methods, in, geography, became, particularly, influential, in, the, discipline, during, the, quantitative, revolution, of, the, 1950s, and, 60s, these, methods, revitalized, the, discipline, in, many, ways, allowing, scientific, testing, of, hypotheses, and, proposing, scientific, geographic, theories, and, laws, the, quantitative, revolution, heavily, influenced, and, revitalized, technical, geography, and, lead, to, the, development, of, the, subfield, of, quantitative, geography, cartography, is, the, art, science, and, technology, of, making, maps, cartographers, study, the, earth, s, surface, representation, with, abstract, symbols, map, making, although, other, subdisciplines, of, geography, rely, on, maps, for, presenting, their, analyses, the, actual, making, of, maps, is, abstract, enough, to, be, regarded, separately, cartography, has, grown, from, a, collection, of, drafting, techniques, into, an, actual, science, cartographers, must, learn, cognitive, psychology, and, ergonomics, to, understand, which, symbols, convey, information, about, the, earth, most, effectively, and, behavioural, psychology, to, induce, the, readers, of, their, maps, to, act, on, the, information, they, must, learn, geodesy, and, fairly, advanced, mathematics, to, understand, how, the, shape, of, the, earth, affects, the, distortion, of, map, symbols, projected, onto, a, flat, surface, for, viewing, it, can, be, said, without, much, controversy, that, cartography, is, the, seed, from, which, the, larger, field, of, geography, grew, geographic, information, systems, gis, deal, with, storing, information, about, the, earth, for, automatic, retrieval, by, a, computer, in, an, accurate, manner, appropriate, to, the, information, s, purpose, in, addition, to, all, of, the, other, subdisciplines, of, geography, gis, specialists, must, understand, computer, science, and, database, systems, gis, has, revolutionized, the, field, of, cartography, nearly, all, mapmaking, is, now, done, with, the, assistance, of, some, form, of, gis, software, the, science, of, using, gis, software, and, gis, techniques, to, represent, analyse, and, predict, the, spatial, relationships, is, called, geographic, information, science, gisc, remote, sensing, is, the, art, science, and, technology, of, obtaining, information, about, earth, s, features, from, measurements, made, at, a, distance, remotely, sensed, data, can, be, either, passive, such, as, traditional, photography, or, active, such, as, lidar, a, variety, of, platforms, can, be, used, for, remote, sensing, including, satellite, imagery, aerial, photography, including, consumer, drones, and, data, obtained, from, hand, held, sensors, products, from, remote, sensing, include, digital, elevation, model, and, cartographic, base, maps, geographers, increasingly, use, remotely, sensed, data, to, obtain, information, about, the, earth, s, land, surface, ocean, and, atmosphere, because, it, a, supplies, objective, information, at, a, variety, of, spatial, scales, local, to, global, b, provides, a, synoptic, view, of, the, area, of, interest, c, allows, access, to, distant, and, inaccessible, sites, d, provides, spectral, information, outside, the, visible, portion, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, and, e, facilitates, studies, of, how, features, areas, change, over, time, remotely, sensed, data, may, be, analyzed, independently, or, in, conjunction, with, other, digital, data, layers, e, g, in, a, geographic, information, system, remote, sensing, aids, in, land, use, land, cover, lulc, mapping, by, helping, to, determine, both, what, is, naturally, occurring, on, a, piece, of, land, and, what, human, activities, are, taking, place, on, it, geostatistics, deal, with, quantitative, data, analysis, specifically, the, application, of, a, statistical, methodology, to, the, exploration, of, geographic, phenomena, geostatistics, is, used, extensively, in, a, variety, of, fields, including, hydrology, geology, petroleum, exploration, weather, analysis, urban, planning, logistics, and, epidemiology, the, mathematical, basis, for, geostatistics, derives, from, cluster, analysis, linear, discriminant, analysis, and, non, parametric, statistical, tests, and, a, variety, of, other, subjects, applications, of, geostatistics, rely, heavily, on, geographic, information, systems, particularly, for, the, interpolation, estimate, of, unmeasured, points, geographers, are, making, notable, contributions, to, the, method, of, quantitative, techniques, qualitative, methods, in, geography, are, descriptive, rather, than, numerical, or, statistical, in, nature, they, add, context, to, concepts, and, explore, human, concepts, like, beliefs, and, perspective, that, are, difficult, or, impossible, to, quantify, human, geography, is, much, more, likely, to, employ, qualitative, methods, than, physical, geography, increasingly, technical, geographers, are, attempting, to, employ, gis, methods, to, qualitative, datasets, qualitative, cartography, employs, many, of, the, same, software, and, techniques, as, quantitative, cartography, it, may, be, employed, to, inform, on, map, practices, or, to, visualize, perspectives, and, ideas, that, are, not, strictly, quantitative, in, nature, an, example, of, a, form, of, qualitative, cartography, is, a, chorochromatic, map, of, nominal, data, such, as, land, cover, or, dominant, language, group, in, an, area, another, example, is, a, deep, map, or, maps, that, combine, geography, and, storytelling, to, produce, a, product, with, greater, information, than, a, two, dimensional, image, of, places, names, and, topography, this, approach, offers, more, inclusive, strategies, than, more, traditional, cartographic, approaches, for, connecting, the, complex, layers, that, makeup, places, ethnographical, research, techniques, are, used, by, human, geographers, in, cultural, geography, there, is, a, tradition, of, employing, qualitative, research, techniques, also, used, in, anthropology, and, sociology, participant, observation, and, in, depth, interviews, provide, human, geographers, with, qualitative, data, geopoetics, is, an, interdisciplinary, approach, that, combines, geography, and, poetry, to, explore, the, interconnectedness, between, humans, space, place, and, the, environment, geopoetics, is, employed, as, a, mixed, methods, tool, to, explain, the, implications, of, geographic, research, it, is, often, employed, to, address, and, communicate, the, implications, of, complex, topics, such, as, the, anthropocene, geographers, employ, interviews, to, gather, data, and, acquire, valuable, understandings, from, individuals, or, groups, regarding, their, encounters, outlooks, and, opinions, concerning, spatial, phenomena, interviews, can, be, carried, out, through, various, mediums, including, face, to, face, interactions, phone, conversations, online, platforms, or, written, exchanges, geographers, typically, adopt, a, structured, or, semi, structured, approach, during, interviews, involving, specific, questions, or, discussion, points, when, utilized, for, research, purposes, these, questions, are, designed, to, extract, focused, information, about, the, research, topic, while, being, flexible, enough, to, allow, participants, to, express, their, experiences, and, viewpoints, such, as, through, open, ended, questions, the, concept, of, geography, is, present, in, all, cultures, and, therefore, the, history, of, the, discipline, is, a, series, of, competing, narratives, with, concepts, emerging, at, various, points, across, space, and, time, the, oldest, known, world, maps, date, back, to, ancient, babylon, from, the, 9th, century, bc, the, best, known, babylonian, world, map, however, is, the, imago, mundi, of, 600, bc, the, map, as, reconstructed, by, eckhard, unger, shows, babylon, on, the, euphrates, surrounded, by, a, circular, landmass, showing, assyria, urartu, and, several, cities, in, turn, surrounded, by, a, bitter, river, oceanus, with, seven, islands, arranged, around, it, so, as, to, form, a, seven, pointed, star, the, accompanying, text, mentions, seven, outer, regions, beyond, the, encircling, ocean, the, descriptions, of, five, of, them, have, survived, in, contrast, to, the, imago, mundi, an, earlier, babylonian, world, map, dating, back, to, the, 9th, century, bc, depicted, babylon, as, being, further, north, from, the, center, of, the, world, though, it, is, not, certain, what, that, center, was, supposed, to, represent, the, ideas, of, anaximander, c, 610, 545, bc, considered, by, later, greek, writers, to, be, the, true, founder, of, geography, come, to, us, through, fragments, quoted, by, his, successors, anaximander, is, credited, with, the, invention, of, the, gnomon, the, simple, yet, efficient, greek, instrument, that, allowed, the, early, measurement, of, latitude, thales, is, also, credited, with, the, prediction, of, eclipses, the, foundations, of, geography, can, be, traced, to, ancient, cultures, such, as, the, ancient, medieval, and, early, modern, chinese, the, greeks, who, were, the, first, to, explore, geography, as, both, art, and, science, achieved, this, through, cartography, philosophy, and, literature, or, through, mathematics, there, is, some, debate, about, who, was, the, first, person, to, assert, that, the, earth, is, spherical, in, shape, with, the, credit, going, either, to, parmenides, or, pythagoras, anaxagoras, was, able, to, demonstrate, that, the, profile, of, the, earth, was, circular, by, explaining, eclipses, however, he, still, believed, that, the, earth, was, a, flat, disk, as, did, many, of, his, contemporaries, one, of, the, first, estimates, of, the, radius, of, the, earth, was, made, by, eratosthenes, the, first, rigorous, system, of, latitude, and, longitude, lines, is, credited, to, hipparchus, he, employed, a, sexagesimal, system, that, was, derived, from, babylonian, mathematics, the, meridians, were, subdivided, into, 360, with, each, degree, further, subdivided, into, 60, minutes, to, measure, the, longitude, at, different, locations, on, earth, he, suggested, using, eclipses, to, determine, the, relative, difference, in, time, the, extensive, mapping, by, the, romans, as, they, explored, new, lands, would, later, provide, a, high, level, of, information, for, ptolemy, to, construct, detailed, atlases, he, extended, the, work, of, hipparchus, using, a, grid, system, on, his, maps, and, adopting, a, length, of, 56, 5, miles, for, a, degree, from, the, 3rd, century, onwards, chinese, methods, of, geographical, study, and, writing, of, geographical, literature, became, much, more, comprehensive, than, what, was, found, in, europe, at, the, time, until, the, 13th, century, chinese, geographers, such, as, liu, an, pei, xiu, jia, dan, shen, kuo, fan, chengda, zhou, daguan, and, xu, xiake, wrote, important, treatises, yet, by, the, 17th, century, advanced, ideas, and, methods, of, western, style, geography, were, adopted, in, china, during, the, middle, ages, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, led, to, a, shift, in, the, evolution, of, geography, from, europe, to, the, islamic, world, muslim, geographers, such, as, muhammad, al, idrisi, produced, detailed, world, maps, such, as, tabula, rogeriana, while, other, geographers, such, as, yaqut, al, hamawi, abu, rayhan, biruni, ibn, battuta, and, ibn, khaldun, provided, detailed, accounts, of, their, journeys, and, the, geography, of, the, regions, they, visited, turkish, geographer, mahmud, al, kashgari, drew, a, world, map, on, a, linguistic, basis, and, later, so, did, piri, reis, piri, reis, map, further, islamic, scholars, translated, and, interpreted, the, earlier, works, of, the, romans, and, the, greeks, and, established, the, house, of, wisdom, in, baghdad, for, this, purpose, ab, zayd, al, balkh, originally, from, balkh, founded, the, balkh, school, of, terrestrial, mapping, in, baghdad, suhr, b, a, late, tenth, century, muslim, geographer, accompanied, a, book, of, geographical, coordinates, with, instructions, for, making, a, rectangular, world, map, with, equirectangular, projection, or, cylindrical, equidistant, projection, abu, rayhan, biruni, 976, 1048, first, described, a, polar, equi, azimuthal, equidistant, projection, of, the, celestial, sphere, he, was, regarded, as, the, most, skilled, when, it, came, to, mapping, cities, and, measuring, the, distances, between, them, which, he, did, for, many, cities, in, the, middle, east, and, the, indian, subcontinent, he, often, combined, astronomical, readings, and, mathematical, equations, to, develop, methods, of, pin, pointing, locations, by, recording, degrees, of, latitude, and, longitude, he, also, developed, similar, techniques, when, it, came, to, measuring, the, heights, of, mountains, depths, of, the, valleys, and, expanse, of, the, horizon, he, also, discussed, human, geography, and, the, planetary, habitability, of, the, earth, he, also, calculated, the, latitude, of, kath, khwarezm, using, the, maximum, altitude, of, the, sun, and, solved, a, complex, geodesic, equation, to, accurately, compute, the, earth, s, circumference, which, was, close, to, modern, values, of, the, earth, s, circumference, his, estimate, of, 6, 339, 9, km, for, the, earth, radius, was, only, 16, 8, km, less, than, the, modern, value, of, 6, 356, 7, km, in, contrast, to, his, predecessors, who, measured, the, earth, s, circumference, by, sighting, the, sun, simultaneously, from, two, different, locations, al, biruni, developed, a, new, method, of, using, trigonometric, calculations, based, on, the, angle, between, a, plain, and, mountain, top, which, yielded, more, accurate, measurements, of, the, earth, s, circumference, and, made, it, possible, for, it, to, be, measured, by, a, single, person, from, a, single, location, the, european, age, of, discovery, during, the, 16th, and, the, 17th, centuries, where, many, new, lands, were, discovered, and, accounts, by, european, explorers, such, as, christopher, columbus, marco, polo, and, james, cook, revived, a, desire, for, both, accurate, geographic, detail, and, more, solid, theoretical, foundations, in, europe, in, 1650, the, first, edition, of, the, geographia, generalis, was, published, by, bernhardus, varenius, which, was, later, edited, and, republished, by, others, including, isaac, newton, this, textbook, sought, to, integrate, new, scientific, discoveries, and, principles, into, classical, geography, and, approach, the, discipline, like, the, other, sciences, emerging, and, is, seen, by, some, as, the, division, between, ancient, and, modern, geography, in, the, west, the, geographia, generalis, contained, both, theoretical, background, and, practical, applications, related, to, ship, navigation, the, remaining, problem, facing, both, explorers, and, geographers, was, finding, the, latitude, and, longitude, of, a, geographic, location, while, the, problem, of, latitude, was, solved, long, ago, but, that, of, longitude, remained, agreeing, on, what, zero, meridians, should, be, was, only, part, of, the, problem, it, was, left, to, john, harrison, to, solve, it, by, inventing, the, chronometer, h, 4, in, 1760, and, later, in, 1884, for, the, international, meridian, conference, to, adopt, by, convention, the, greenwich, meridian, as, zero, meridians, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, were, the, times, when, geography, became, recognized, as, a, discrete, academic, discipline, and, became, part, of, a, typical, university, curriculum, in, europe, especially, paris, and, berlin, the, development, of, many, geographic, societies, also, occurred, during, the, 19th, century, with, the, foundations, of, the, soci, t, de, g, ographie, in, 1821, the, royal, geographical, society, in, 1830, russian, geographical, society, in, 1845, american, geographical, society, in, 1851, and, the, national, geographic, society, in, 1888, the, influence, of, immanuel, kant, alexander, von, humboldt, carl, ritter, and, paul, vidal, de, la, blache, can, be, seen, as, a, major, turning, point, in, geography, from, philosophy, to, an, academic, subject, over, the, past, two, centuries, the, advancements, in, technology, with, computers, have, led, to, the, development, of, geomatics, and, new, practices, such, as, participant, observation, and, geostatistics, being, incorporated, into, geography, s, portfolio, of, tools, in, the, west, during, the, 20th, century, the, discipline, of, geography, went, through, four, major, phases, environmental, determinism, regional, geography, the, quantitative, revolution, and, critical, geography, the, strong, interdisciplinary, links, between, geography, and, the, sciences, of, geology, and, botany, as, well, as, economics, sociology, and, demographics, have, also, grown, greatly, especially, as, a, result, of, earth, system, science, that, seeks, to, understand, the, world, in, a, holistic, view, new, concepts, and, philosophies, have, emerged, from, the, rapid, advancement, of, computers, quantitative, methods, and, interdisciplinary, approaches, in, 1970, waldo, tobler, proposed, the, first, law, of, geography, everything, is, related, to, everything, else, but, near, things, are, more, related, than, distant, things, this, law, summarizes, the, first, assumption, geographers, make, about, the, world, the, discipline, of, geography, especially, physical, geography, and, geology, have, significant, overlap, in, the, past, the, two, have, often, shared, academic, departments, at, universities, a, point, that, has, led, to, conflict, over, resources, both, disciplines, do, seek, to, understand, the, rocks, on, the, earth, s, surface, and, the, processes, that, change, them, over, time, geology, employs, many, of, the, tools, and, techniques, of, technical, geographers, such, as, gis, and, remote, sensing, to, aid, in, geological, mapping, however, geology, includes, research, that, goes, beyond, the, spatial, component, such, as, the, chemical, analysis, of, rocks, and, biogeochemistry, the, discipline, of, history, has, significant, overlap, with, geography, especially, human, geography, like, geology, history, and, geography, have, shared, university, departments, geography, provides, the, spatial, context, within, which, historical, events, unfold, the, physical, geographic, features, of, a, region, such, as, its, landforms, climate, and, resources, shape, human, settlements, trade, routes, and, economic, activities, which, in, turn, influence, the, course, of, historical, events, thus, a, historian, must, have, a, strong, foundation, in, geography, historians, employ, the, techniques, of, technical, geographers, to, create, historical, atlases, and, maps, while, the, discipline, of, geography, is, normally, concerned, with, the, earth, the, term, can, also, be, informally, used, to, describe, the, study, of, other, worlds, such, as, the, planets, of, the, solar, system, and, even, beyond, the, study, of, systems, larger, than, the, earth, itself, usually, forms, part, of, astronomy, or, cosmology, the, study, of, other, planets, is, usually, called, planetary, science, alternative, terms, such, as, areography, geography, of, mars, have, been, employed, to, describe, the, study, of, other, celestial, objects, ultimately, geography, may, be, considered, a, subdiscipline, within, planetary, science
