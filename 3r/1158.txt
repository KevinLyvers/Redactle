joined, the, federation, of, australia, in, 1901, and, became, a, founding, state, of, australia, it, was, the, last, of, the, australian, colonies, to, agree, to, join, the, federation, and, it, did, so, only, after, the, other, colonies, had, offered, several, concessions, including, the, construction, of, a, transcontinental, railway, line, from, port, augusta, in, south, australia, to, kalgoorlie, to, link, perth, with, the, eastern, states, in, 1927, indigenous, people, were, prohibited, from, entering, large, swathes, of, perth, under, penalty, of, imprisonment, a, ban, that, lasted, until, 1954, in, 1933, two, thirds, of, western, australians, voted, in, a, referendum, to, secede, from, the, australian, federation, however, the, state, general, election, held, at, the, same, time, as, the, referendum, had, voted, out, the, incumbent, pro, independence, government, replacing, it, with, a, government, that, did, not, support, the, independence, movement, respecting, the, result, of, the, referendum, the, new, government, nonetheless, petitioned, the, imperial, parliament, at, westminster, the, house, of, commons, established, a, select, committee, to, consider, the, issue, but, after, 18, months, of, negotiations, and, lobbying, finally, refused, to, consider, the, matter, declaring, that, it, could, not, legally, grant, secession, perth, entered, the, post,

the, willcock, labor, government, 1936, 1945, determined, to, change, this, planning, for, post, war, economic, development, was, initially, driven, by, russell, dumas, who, as, director, of, public, works, 1941, 1953, drew, up, plans, for, western, australia, s, major, post, war, public, works, projects, including, the, raising, of, the, mundaring, and, wellington, dams, the, development, of, the, new, perth, airport, and, the, development, of, a, new, industrial, zone, centred, on, kwinana, the, advent, of, the, mclarty, liberal, government, 1947, 1953, saw, the, emergence, of, something, of, a, consensus, on, the, need, for, continuing, economic, development, economic, growth, was, fuelled, by, large, scale, public, works, the, post, war, immigration, program, and, the, success, that, various, state, governments, had, in, attracting, substantial, foreign, investment, into, the, state, beginning, with, the, construction, of, the, anglo, iranian, oil, refinery, at, kwinana, in, 1951, 52, the, result, of, this, economic, activity, was, the, rapid, growth, of, the, population, of, perth, and, a, marked, change, in, its, urban, design, commencing, in, the, 1950s, perth, began, to, expand, along, an, extensive, highway, network, laid, out, in, the, stephenson, hepburn, report, which, noted, that, perth, was, beginning, to, resemble, a, pattern, of, development, less, in, line, with, the, british, experience, and, more, in, line, with, north, america, this, was, encouraged, by, the, opening, of, the, narrows, bridge, and, the, gradual, closure, of, the, perth, fremantle, tramways, the, mining, pastoral, boom, of, the, 1960s, only, accelerated, the, pace, of, urban, growth, in, perth, in, 1962, perth, received, global, media, attention, when, city, residents, lit,
