the, caucasus, mountains, is, a, mountain, range, at, the, intersection, of, asia, and, europe, stretching, between, the, black, sea, and, the, caspian, sea, they, are, surrounded, by, the, caucasus, region, and, are, home, to, mount, elbrus, the, highest, peak, in, europe, at, 5, 642, metres, 18, 510, ft, above, sea, level, the, caucasus, mountains, include, the, greater, caucasus, in, the, north, and, the, lesser, caucasus, in, the, south, the, greater, caucasus, runs, west, northwest, to, east, southeast, from, the, western, caucasus, on, the, northeastern, shore, of, the, black, sea, to, close, to, baku, on, the, caspian, sea, in, azerbaijan, the, lesser, caucasus, runs, parallel, to, the, greater, about, 100, km, 62, mi, south, the, greater, and, lesser, caucasus, ranges, are, connected, by, the, likhi, range, and, to, the, west, and, east, of, the, likhi, range, lie, the, colchis, plain, and, the, kur, araz, lowland, respectively, the, meskheti, range, is, a, part, of, the, lesser, caucasus, system, in, the, southeast, the, aras, river, separates, the, lesser, caucasus, from, the, talysh, mountains, which, runs, through, the, greater, azerbaijan, region, the, lesser, caucasus, and, the, armenian, highland, constitute, the, transcaucasian, highland, which, at, their, western, end, converges, with, the, highland, plateau, of, eastern, anatolia, the, caucasus, mountains, were, part, of, the, silk, road, geologically, the, caucasus, mountains, belong, to, the, alpide, belt, system, that, extends, from, southeastern, europe, into, asia, and, is, considered, a, border, between, the, two, continents, the, greater, caucasus, mountains, are, mainly, composed, of, cretaceous, and, jurassic, rocks, with, the, paleozoic, and, precambrian, rocks, in, the, higher, regions, some, volcanic, formations, are, found, throughout, the, range, on, the, other, hand, the, lesser, caucasus, mountains, are, formed, predominantly, of, the, paleogene, rocks, with, a, much, smaller, portion, of, jurassic, and, cretaceous, rocks, the, evolution, of, the, caucasus, began, from, the, late, triassic, to, the, late, jurassic, during, the, cimmerian, orogeny, at, the, active, margin, of, the, tethys, ocean, while, the, uplift, of, the, greater, caucasus, is, dated, to, the, miocene, during, the, alpine, orogeny, the, caucasus, mountains, formed, largely, as, the, result, of, a, tectonic, plate, collision, between, the, arabian, plate, moving, northwards, with, respect, to, the, eurasian, plate, as, the, tethys, sea, was, closed, and, the, arabian, plate, collided, with, the, iranian, plate, and, was, pushed, against, it, and, with, the, clockwise, movement, of, the, eurasian, plate, towards, the, iranian, plate, and, their, final, collision, the, iranian, plate, was, pressed, against, the, eurasian, plate, as, this, happened, the, rocks, that, had, been, deposited, in, this, basin, from, the, jurassic, to, the, miocene, were, folded, to, form, the, greater, caucasus, mountains, this, collision, also, caused, the, uplift, and, the, cenozoic, volcanic, activity, in, the, lesser, caucasus, mountains, the, entire, region, is, regularly, subjected, to, strong, earthquakes, from, this, activity, while, the, greater, caucasus, mountains, have, a, mainly, folded, sedimentary, structure, the, lesser, caucasus, mountains, are, largely, of, volcanic, origin, the, javakheti, volcanic, plateau, in, georgia, and, the, surrounding, volcanic, ranges, which, extend, well, into, central, armenia, are, some, of, the, youngest, features, of, the, region, only, recently, was, the, caucasus, a, scene, for, intense, volcanic, activity, the, armenian, highland, was, flooded, by, calc, alkaline, basalts, and, andesites, in, the, pliocene, and, the, highest, summits, of, the, caucasus, the, elbrus, and, the, kazbek, formed, as, pleistocene, pliocene, volcanoes, the, kazbek, is, no, longer, active, but, the, elbrus, erupted, in, postglacial, times, and, fumarole, activity, is, registered, near, its, summit, contemporary, seismic, activity, is, a, prominent, feature, of, the, region, reflecting, active, faulting, and, crustal, shortening, clusters, of, seismicity, occur, in, dagestan, and, in, northern, armenia, many, devastating, earthquakes, have, been, documented, in, historical, times, including, the, spitak, earthquake, in, december, 1988, which, destroyed, the, gyumri, vanadzor, region, of, armenia, mount, elbrus, at, 5, 642, m, 18, 510, ft, in, the, caucasus, mountains, is, sometimes, cited, as, the, highest, peak, in, europe, mount, elbrus, is, 832, m, 2, 730, ft, higher, than, mont, blanc, the, highest, peak, in, the, alps, and, western, europe, at, 4, 810, m, 15, 780, ft, however, there, are, some, technical, disagreements, over, whether, mount, elbrus, is, in, europe, the, crest, of, the, greater, caucasus, mountains, is, usually, taken, to, define, the, greater, caucasus, watershed, which, marks, the, continental, boundary, between, asia, and, europe, for, the, region, between, the, black, and, caspian, seas, this, classification, would, place, mount, elbrus, at, the, junction, with, asia, the, table, below, lists, some, of, the, highest, peaks, of, the, caucasus, with, the, exception, of, shkhara, the, heights, are, taken, from, soviet, 1, 50, 000, mapping, the, list, includes, the, ten, ultras, mountains, of, more, than, 1, 500, m, prominence, and, all, mountains, over, 4, 500, m, height, with, 300, m, prominence, mount, a, r, 5, 137, m, in, turkey, is, just, south, of, the, lesser, caucasus, the, climate, of, the, caucasus, varies, both, vertically, according, to, elevation, and, horizontally, by, latitude, and, location, temperature, generally, decreases, as, elevation, rises, average, annual, temperature, in, sukhumi, abkhazia, at, sea, level, is, 15, c, 59, f, while, on, the, slopes, of, mt, kazbek, at, an, elevation, of, 3, 700, metres, 12, 100, ft, average, annual, temperature, falls, to, 6, 1, c, 21, 0, f, the, northern, slopes, of, the, greater, caucasus, mountain, range, are, 3, c, 5, 4, f, colder, than, the, southern, slopes, the, highlands, of, the, lesser, caucasus, mountains, in, armenia, azerbaijan, and, georgia, are, marked, by, sharp, temperature, contrasts, between, the, summer, and, winter, months, due, to, a, more, continental, climate, precipitation, increases, from, east, to, west, in, most, areas, elevation, plays, an, important, role, in, the, caucasus, and, mountains, generally, receive, higher, amounts, of, precipitation, than, low, lying, areas, the, north, eastern, regions, dagestan, and, the, southern, portions, of, the, lesser, caucasus, mountains, are, the, driest, the, absolute, minimum, annual, precipitation, is, 250, mm, 9, 84, in, in, the, northeastern, caspian, depression, western, parts, of, the, caucasus, mountains, are, marked, by, high, amounts, of, precipitation, the, southern, slopes, of, the, greater, caucasus, mountain, range, receive, higher, amounts, of, precipitation, than, the, northern, slopes, annual, precipitation, in, the, western, caucasus, ranges, from, 1, 000, to, 4, 000, mm, 39, 37,

the, lesser, caucasus, mountain, range, southern, georgia, armenia, western, azerbaijan, not, including, the, meskheti, range, varies, from, 300, 800, mm, 31, 50, in, annually, the, caucasus, mountains, are, known, for, the, high, amount, of, snowfall, although, many, regions, which, are, not, located, along, the, windward, slopes, do, not, receive, nearly, as, much, snow, this, is, especially, true, for, the, lesser, caucasus, mountains, which, are, somewhat, isolated, from, the, moist, influences, coming, in, from, the, black, sea, and, receive, considerably, less, precipitation, in, the, form, of, snow, than, the, greater, caucasus, mountains, the, average, winter, snow, cover, of, the, lesser, caucasus, mountains, ranges, from, 10, to, 30, cm, 3, 94, 11, 81, in, the, greater, caucasus, mountains, especially, the, southwestern, slopes, are, marked, by, heavy, snowfall, avalanches, are, common, from, november, to, april, snow, cover, in, several, regions, svaneti, and, northern, abkhazia, may, reach, 5, metres, 16, ft, the, mt, achishkho, region, which, is, the, snowiest, place, in, the, caucasus, often, records, snow, depths, of, 7, m, 23, ft, the, caucasus, mountains, have, a, varied, landscape, which, changes, according, to, elevation, and, distance, from, large, bodies, of, water, the, region, contains, biomes, ranging, from, subtropical, lowland, marshes, and, forests, to, glaciers, western, and, central, caucasus, and, highland, semideserts, steppes, and, alpine, meadows, in, the, south, mainly, in, armenia, and, azerbaijan, the, northern, slopes, of, the, greater, caucasus, mountains, are, covered, by, oak, hornbeam, maple, and, ash, forests, at, lower, elevations, while, birch, and, pine, forests, take, over, at, higher, elevations, some, of, the, lowest, areas, of, the, region, are, covered, by, steppes, and, grasslands, the, slopes, of, the, north, western, greater, caucasus, kabardino, balkaria, cherkessia, etc,
