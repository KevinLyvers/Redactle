the, pacific, coast, ranges, officially, gazetted, as, the, pacific, mountain, system, in, the, united, states, are, the, series, of, mountain, ranges, that, stretch, along, the, west, coast, of, north, america, from, alaska, south, to, northern, and, central, mexico, although, they, are, commonly, thought, to, be, the, westernmost, mountain, range, of, the, continental, united, states, and, canada, the, geologically, distinct, insular, mountains, of, vancouver, island, lie, farther, west, the, pacific, coast, ranges, are, part, of, the, north, american, cordillera, sometimes, known, as, the, western, cordillera, or, in, canada, as, the, pacific, cordillera, and, or, the, canadian, cordillera, which, includes, the, rocky, mountains, the, columbia, mountains, the, interior, mountains, the, interior, plateau, the, sierra, nevada, the, great, basin, mountain, ranges, and, other, ranges, and, various, plateaus, and, basins, the, pacific, coast, ranges, designation, however, only, applies, to, the, western, system, of, the, western, cordillera, which, comprises, the, saint, elias, mountains, coast, mountains, insular, mountains, olympic, mountains, cascade, range, oregon, coast, range, california, coast, ranges, transverse, ranges, peninsular, ranges, and, the, sierra, madre, occidental, the, term, coast, range, is, used, by, the, united, states, geological, survey, to, refer, only, to, the, ranges, south, of, the, strait, of, juan, de, fuca, in, washington, to, the, california, mexico, border, and, to, those, west, of, puget, sound, the, willamette, valley, and, the, sacramento, and, san, joaquin, valleys, the, california, central, valley, that, definition, excludes, the, sierra, nevada, and, cascade, ranges, the, mojave, high, and, sonoran, low, deserts, i, e, the, pacific, border, province, the, same, term, is, used, informally, in, canada, to, refer, to, the, coast, mountains, and, adjoining, inland, ranges, such, as, the, hazelton, mountains, and, sometimes, also, the, saint, elias, mountains, the, character, of, the, ranges, varies, considerably, from, the, record, setting, tidewater, glaciers, in, the, ranges, of, alaska, to, the, rugged, central, and, southern, california, ranges, the, transverse, ranges, and, peninsular, ranges, in, the, chaparral, and, woodlands, eco, region, with, oak, woodland, chaparral, shrub, forest, or, coastal, sage, scrub, covering, them, the, coastline, is, often, seen, dropping, steeply, into, the, sea, with, photogenic, views, along, the, british, columbia, and, alaska, coast, the, mountains, intermix, with, the, sea, in, a, complex, maze, of, fjords, with, thousands, of, islands, off, the, southern, california, coast, the, channel, islands, archipelago, of, the, santa, monica, mountains, extends, for, 160, miles, 260, km, there, are, coastal, plains, at, the, mouths, of, rivers, that, have, punched, through, the, mountains, spreading, sediments, most, notably, at, the, copper, river, in, alaska, the, fraser, river, in, british, columbia, and, the, columbia, river, between, washington, and, oregon, in, california, the, sacramento, and, san, joaquin, rivers, san, francisco, bay, the, santa, clara, river, s, oxnard, plain, the, los, angeles, san, gabriel, and, santa, ana, rivers, los, angeles, basin, a, coastal, sediment, filled, plain, between, the, peninsular, and, transverse, ranges, with, sediment, in, the, basin, up, to, 6, miles, 10, km, deep, and, the, san, diego, river, s, mission, bay, from, the, vicinity, of, san, francisco, bay, north, it, is, common, in, winter, for, cool, unstable, air, masses, from, the, gulf, of, alaska, to, make, landfall, in, one, of, the, coast, ranges, resulting, in, heavy, precipitation, both, as, rain, and, snow, especially, on, their, western, slopes, the, same, winter, weather, occurs, with, less, frequency, and, precipitation, in, southern, california, with, the, mountains, western, faces, and, peaks, causing, an, eastward, rainshadow, that, produces, the, arid, desert, regions, omitted, from, the, list, below, but, often, included, is, the, sierra, nevada, a, major, mountain, range, of, eastern, california, that, is, separated, by, the, central, valley, over, much, of, its, length, from, the, california, coast, ranges, and, the, transverse, ranges, on, the, west, coast, of, north, america, the, coast, ranges, and, the, coastal, plain, form, the, margin, most, of, the, land, is, made, of, terranes, that, have, been, accreted, onto, the, margin, in, the, north, the, insular, belt, is, an, accreted, terrane, forming, the, margin, this, belt, extends, from, the, wrangellia, terrane, in, alaska, to, the, chilliwack, group, of, canada, a, rupture, in, rodinia, 750, million, years, ago, formed, a, passive, margin, in, the, eastern, pacific, northwest, the, breakup, of, pangea, 200, million, years, ago, began, the, westward, movement, of, the, north, american, plate, creating, an, active, margin, on, the, western, continent, as, the, continent, drifted, west, terranes, were, accreted, onto, the, west, coast, the, timing, of, the, accretion, of, the, insular, belt, is, uncertain, although, the, closure, did, not, occur, until, at, least, 115, million, years, ago, other, mesozoic, terranes, that, accreted, onto, the, continent, include, the, klamath, mountains, the, sierra, nevada, and, the, guerrero, super, terrane, of, western, mexico, 90, 80, million, years, ago, the, subducting, farallon, plate, split, and, formed, the, kula, plate, to, the, north, this, formed, an, area, in, what, is, now, northern, california, where, the, plates, converged, forming, a, m, lange, north, of, this, was, the, columbia, embayment, where, the, continental, margin, was, east, of, the, surrounding, areas, many, of, the, major, batholiths, date, from, the, late, cretaceous, as, the, laramide, orogeny, ended, around, 48, million, years, ago, the, accretion, of, the, siletzia, terrane, began, in, the, pacific, northwest, this, began, the, volcanic, activity, in, the, cascadia, subduction, zone, forming, the, modern, cascade, range, and, lasted, into, the, miocene, events, here, may, relate, to, the, ignimbrite, flare, up, of, the, southern, basin, and, range, as, extension, in, the, basin, and, range, province, slowed, by, a, change, in, north, american, plate, movement, circa, 7, to, 8, million, years, ago, rifting, began, on, the, gulf, of, california, although, many, of, the, ranges, do, share, a, common, geologic, history, the, pacific, coast, ranges, province, is, not, defined, by, geology, but, rather, by, geography, many, of, the, various, ranges, are, composed, of, distinct, forms, of, rock, from, many, different, periods, of, geological, time, from, the, precambrian, in, parts, of, the, little, san, bernardino, mountains, to, 10, 000, year, old, rock, in, the, cascade, range, for, one, example, the, peninsular, ranges, composed, of, mesozoic, batholitic, rock, are, geologically, extremely, different, from, the, san, bernardino, mountains, composed, of, a, mix, of, precambrian, metamorphic, rock, and, cenozoic, sedimentary, rock, however, both, are, considered, part, of, the, pacific, coast, ranges, due, to, their, proximity, and, similar, economic, and, social, impact, on, surrounding, communities, these, are, the, members, of, the, pacific, coast, ranges, from, north, to, south, these, are, not, named, as, ranges, but, amount, to, the, same, thing, the, pacific, coast, ranges, are, home, to, the, largest, temperate, latitude, icefields, in, the, world, only, the, largest, icefields, are, listed, above, smaller, icefields, may, be, listed, on, the, various, range, pages, formally, unnamed, icefields, are, not, listed
