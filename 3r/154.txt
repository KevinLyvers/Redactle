the, missouri, river, is, a, river, in, the, central, and, mountain, west, regions, of, the, united, states, the, nation, s, longest, it, rises, in, the, eastern, centennial, mountains, of, the, bitterroot, range, of, the, rocky, mountains, of, southwestern, montana, then, flows, east, and, south, for, 2, 341, miles, 3, 767, km, before, entering, the, mississippi, river, north, of, st, louis, missouri, the, river, drains, semi, arid, watershed, of, more, than, 500, 000, square, miles, 1, 300, 000, km, 2, which, includes, parts, of, ten, u, s, states, and, two, canadian, provinces, although, a, tributary, of, the, mississippi, the, missouri, river, is, slightly, longer, and, carries, a, comparable, volume, of, water, when, combined, with, the, lower, mississippi, river, it, forms, the, world, s, fourth, longest, river, system, for, over, 12, 000, years, people, have, depended, on, the, missouri, river, and, its, tributaries, as, a, source, of, sustenance, and, transportation, more, than, ten, major, groups, of, native, americans, populated, the, watershed, most, leading, a, nomadic, lifestyle, and, dependent, on, enormous, bison, herds, that, roamed, through, the, great, plains, the, first, europeans, encountered, the, river, in, the, late, seventeenth, century, and, the, region, passed, through, spanish, and, french, hands, before, becoming, part, of, the, united, states, through, the, louisiana, purchase, the, missouri, river, was, one, of, the, main, routes, for, the, westward, expansion, of, the, united, states, during, the, 19th, century, the, growth, of, the, fur, trade, in, the, early, 19th, century, laid, much, of, the, groundwork, as, trappers, explored, the, region, and, blazed, trails, pioneers, headed, west, en, masse, beginning, in, the, 1830s, first, by, covered, wagon, then, by, the, growing, numbers, of, steamboats, that, entered, service, on, the, river, conflict, between, settlers, and, native, americans, in, the, watershed, led, to, some, of, the, most, longstanding, and, violent, of, the, american, indian, wars, during, the, 20th, century, the, missouri, river, basin, was, extensively, developed, for, irrigation, flood, control, and, the, generation, of, hydroelectric, power, fifteen, dams, impound, the, main, stem, of, the, river, with, hundreds, more, on, tributaries, meanders, have, been, cut, off, and, the, river, channelized, to, improve, navigation, reducing, its, length, by, almost, 200, miles, 320, km, from, pre, development, times, although, the, lower, missouri, valley, is, now, a, populous, and, highly, productive, agricultural, and, industrial, region, heavy, development, has, taken, its, toll, on, wildlife, and, fish, populations, as, well, as, water, quality, from, the, rocky, mountains, three, streams, rise, to, form, the, headwaters, of, the, missouri, river, the, missouri, river, officially, starts, at, the, confluence, of, the, jefferson, and, madison, in, missouri, headwaters, state, park, near, three, forks, montana, and, is, joined, by, the, gallatin, a, mile, 1, 6, km, downstream, it, then, passes, through, canyon, ferry, lake, a, reservoir, west, of, the, big, belt, mountains, issuing, from, the, mountains, near, cascade, the, river, flows, northeast, to, the, city, of, great, falls, where, it, drops, over, the, great, falls, of, the, missouri, a, series, of, five, substantial, waterfalls, it, then, winds, east, through, a, scenic, region, of, canyons, and, badlands, known, as, the, missouri, breaks, receiving, the, marias, river, from, the, west, then, widening, into, the, fort, peck, lake, reservoir, a, few, miles, above, the, confluence, with, the, musselshell, river, farther, on, the, river, passes, through, the, fort, peck, dam, and, immediately, downstream, the, milk, river, joins, from, the, north, flowing, eastward, through, the, plains, of, eastern, montana, the, missouri, receives, the, poplar, river, from, the, north, before, crossing, into, north, dakota, where, the, yellowstone, river, its, greatest, tributary, by, volume, joins, from, the, southwest, at, the, confluence, the, yellowstone, is, actually, the, larger, river, the, missouri, then, meanders, east, past, williston, and, into, lake, sakakawea, the, reservoir, formed, by, garrison, dam, below, the, dam, the, missouri, receives, the, knife, river, from, the, west, and, flows, south, to, bismarck, the, capital, of, north, dakota, where, the, heart, river, joins, from, the, west, it, slows, into, the, lake, oahe, reservoir, just, before, the, cannonball, river, confluence, while, it, continues, south, eventually, reaching, oahe, dam, in, south, dakota, the, grand, moreau, and, cheyenne, rivers, all, join, the, missouri, from, the, west, the, missouri, makes, a, bend, to, the, southeast, as, it, winds, through, the, great, plains, receiving, the, niobrara, river, and, many, smaller, tributaries, from, the, southwest, it, then, proceeds, to, form, the, boundary, of, south, dakota, and, nebraska, and, is, joined, by, the, james, river, from, the, north, at, sioux, city, the, big, sioux, river, comes, in, from, the, north, after, which, the, missouri, forms, the, iowa, nebraska, boundary, it, flows, south, to, the, city, of, omaha, where, it, receives, its, longest, tributary, the, platte, river, from, the, west, downstream, it, begins, to, define, the, border, between, the, states, of, nebraska, and, missouri, then, flows, between, the, states, of, missouri, and, kansas, the, missouri, swings, east, at, kansas, city, where, the, kansas, river, enters, from, the, west, and, so, on, into, north, central, missouri, to, the, east, of, kansas, city, the, missouri, receives, on, the, left, side, the, grand, river, it, passes, south, of, columbia, and, receives, the, osage, and, gasconade, rivers, from, the, south, downstream, of, jefferson, city, the, river, then, rounds, the, northern, side, of, st, louis, to, join, the, mississippi, river, on, the, border, between, missouri, and, illinois, there, is, only, one, river, with, a, personality, a, sense, of, humor, and, a, woman, s, caprice, a, river, that, goes, traveling, sidewise, that, interferes, in, politics, rearranges, geography, and, dabbles, in, real, estate, a, river, that, plays, hide, and, seek, with, you, today, and, tomorrow, follows, you, around, like, a, pet, dog, with, a, dynamite, cracker, tied, to, his, tail, that, river, is, the, missouri, with, a, drainage, basin, spanning, 529, 350, square, miles, 1, 371, 000, km, 2, the, missouri, river, s, catchment, encompasses, nearly, one, sixth, of, the, area, of, the, united, states, or, just, over, five, percent, of, the, continent, of, north, america, comparable, to, the, size, of, the, canadian, province, of, quebec, the, watershed, encompasses, most, of, the, central, great, plains, stretching, from, the, rocky, mountains, in, the, west, to, the, mississippi, river, valley, in, the, east, and, from, the, southern, extreme, of, western, canada, to, the, border, of, the, arkansas, river, watershed, compared, with, the, mississippi, river, above, their, confluence, the, missouri, is, twice, as, long, and, drains, an, area, three, times, as, large, the, missouri, accounts, for, 45, percent, of, the, annual, flow, of, the, mississippi, past, st, louis, and, as, much, as, 70, percent, in, certain, droughts, in, 1990, the, missouri, river, watershed, was, home, to, about, 12, million, people, this, included, the, entire, population, of, the, u, s, state, of, nebraska, parts, of, the, u, s, states, of, colorado, iowa, kansas, minnesota, missouri, montana, north, dakota, south, dakota, and, wyoming, and, small, southern, portions, of, the, canadian, provinces, of, alberta, and, saskatchewan, the, watershed, s, largest, city, is, denver, colorado, with, a, population, of, more, than, six, hundred, thousand, denver, is, the, main, city, of, the, front, range, urban, corridor, whose, cities, had, a, combined, population, of, over, four, million, in, 2005, making, it, the, largest, metropolitan, area, in, the, missouri, river, basin, other, major, population, centers, mostly, in, the, watershed, s, southeastern, portion, include, omaha, nebraska, north, of, the, confluence, of, the, missouri, and, platte, rivers, kansas, city, missouri, kansas, city, kansas, at, the, confluence, of, the, missouri, with, the, kansas, river, and, the, st, louis, metropolitan, area, south, of, the, missouri, river, just, below, the, latter, s, mouth, on, the, mississippi, in, contrast, the, northwestern, part, of, the, watershed, is, sparsely, populated, however, many, northwestern, cities, such, as, billings, montana, are, among, the, fastest, growing, in, the, missouri, basin, with, more, than, 170, 000, square, miles, 440, 000, km, 2, under, the, plow, the, missouri, river, watershed, includes, roughly, one, fourth, of, all, the, agricultural, land, in, the, united, states, providing, more, than, a, third, of, the, country, s, wheat, flax, barley, and, oats, however, only, 11, 000, square, miles, 28, 000, km, 2, of, farmland, in, the, basin, is, irrigated, a, further, 281, 000, square, miles, 730, 000, km, 2, of, the, basin, is, devoted, to, the, raising, of, livestock, mainly, cattle, forested, areas, of, the, watershed, mostly, second, growth, total, about, 43, 700, square, miles, 113, 000, km, 2, urban, areas, on, the, other, hand, comprise, less, than, 13, 000, square, miles, 34, 000, km, 2, of, land, most, built, up, areas, are, along, the, main, stem, and, a, few, major, tributaries, including, the, platte, and, yellowstone, rivers, elevations, in, the, watershed, vary, widely, ranging, from, just, over, 400, feet, 120, m, at, the, missouri, s, mouth, to, the, 14, 293, foot, 4, 357, m, summit, of, mount, lincoln, in, central, colorado, the, river, drops, 8, 626, feet, 2, 629, m, from, brower, s, spring, the, farthest, source, although, the, plains, of, the, watershed, have, extremely, little, local, vertical, relief, the, land, rises, about, 10, feet, per, mile, 1, 9, m, km, from, east, to, west, the, elevation, is, less, than, 500, feet, 150, m, at, the, eastern, border, of, the, watershed, but, is, over, 3, 000, feet, 910, m, above, sea, level, in, many, places, at, the, base, of, the, rockies, the, missouri, s, drainage, basin, has, highly, variable, weather, and, rainfall, patterns, overall, the, watershed, is, defined, by, a, continental, climate, with, warm, wet, summers, and, harsh, cold, winters, most, of, the, watershed, receives, an, average, of, 8, to, 10, inches, 200, to, 250, mm, of, precipitation, each, year, however, the, westernmost, portions, of, the, basin, in, the, rockies, as, well, as, southeastern, regions, in, missouri, may, receive, as, much, as, 40, inches, 1, 000, mm, the, vast, majority, of, precipitation, occurs, in, summer, in, most, of, the, lower, and, middle, basin, although, the, upper, basin, is, known, for, short, lived, but, intense, summer, thunderstorms, such, as, the, one, which, produced, the, 1972, black, hills, flood, through, rapid, city, south, dakota, winter, temperatures, in, the, northern, and, western, portions, of, the, basin, typically, drop, to, 20, f, 28, 9, c, or, lower, every, winter, with, extremes, as, low, as, 60, f, 51, 1, c, while, summer, highs, occasionally, exceed, 100, f, 37, 8, c, in, all, areas, except, the, higher, elevations, of, montana, wyoming, and, colorado, extreme, maxima, almost, all, prior, to, 1960, have, exceeded, 115, f, 46, 1, c, in, all, us, states, in, the, basin, as, one, of, the, continent, s, most, significant, river, systems, the, missouri, s, drainage, basin, borders,

the, missouri, watershed, the, clark, fork, and, snake, river, both, part, of, the, columbia, river, basin, drain, the, area, west, of, the, rockies, in, montana, idaho, and, western, wyoming, the, columbia, missouri, and, colorado, river, watersheds, meet, at, three, waters, mountain, in, wyoming, s, wind, river, range, south, of, there, the, missouri, basin, is, bordered, on, the, west, by, the, drainage, of, the, green, river, a, tributary, of, the, colorado, then, on, the, south, by, the, mainstem, of, the, colorado, both, the, colorado, and, columbia, rivers, flow, to, the, pacific, ocean, however, a, large, endorheic, drainage, called, the, great, divide, basin, exists, between, the, missouri, and, green, watersheds, in, western, wyoming, this, area, is, sometimes, counted, as, part, of, the, missouri, river, watershed, even, though, its, waters, do, not, flow, to, either, side, of, the, continental, divide, to, the, north, the, much, lower, laurentian, divide, separates, the, missouri, river, watershed, from, those, of, the, oldman, river, a, tributary, of, the, south, saskatchewan, river, as, well, as, the, souris, sheyenne, and, smaller, tributaries, of, the, red, river, of, the, north, all, of, these, streams, are, part, of, canada, s, nelson, river, drainage, basin, which, empties, into, hudson, bay, there, are, also, several, large, endorheic, basins, between, the, missouri, and, nelson, watersheds, in, southern, alberta, and, saskatchewan, the, minnesota, and, des, moines, rivers, tributaries, of, the, upper, mississippi, drain, most, of, the, area, bordering, the, eastern, side, of, the, missouri, river, basin, finally, on, the, south, the, ozark, mountains, and, other, low, divides, through, central, missouri, kansas, and, colorado, separate, the, missouri, watershed, from, those, of, the, white, river, and, arkansas, river, also, tributaries, of, the, mississippi, river, over, 95, significant, tributaries, and, hundreds, of, smaller, ones, feed, the, missouri, river, with, most, of, the, larger, ones, coming, in, as, the, river, draws, close, to, the, mouth, most, rivers, and, streams, in, the, missouri, river, basin, flow, from, west, to, east, following, the, incline, of, the, great, plains, however, some, eastern, tributaries, such, as, the, james, big, sioux, and, grand, river, systems, flow, from, north, to, south, the, missouri, s, largest, tributaries, by, runoff, are, the, yellowstone, in, montana, and, wyoming, the, platte, in, wyoming, colorado, and, nebraska, and, the, kansas, republican, smoky, hill, and, osage, in, kansas, and, missouri, each, of, these, tributaries, drains, an, area, greater, than, 50, 000, square, miles, 130, 000, km, 2, or, has, an, average, discharge, greater, than, 5, 000, cu, ft, s, 140, m, 3, s, the, yellowstone, river, has, the, highest, discharge, even, though, the, platte, is, longer, and, drains, a, larger, area, in, fact, the, yellowstone, s, flow, is, about, 13, 800, cu, ft, s, 390, m, 3, s, accounting, for, sixteen, percent, of, total, runoff, in, the, missouri, basin, and, nearly, double, that, of, the, platte, on, the, other, end, of, the, scale, is, the, tiny, roe, river, in, montana, which, at, 201, feet, 61, m, long, is, one, of, the, world, s, shortest, rivers, the, table, on, the, right, lists, the, ten, longest, tributaries, of, the, missouri, along, with, their, respective, catchment, areas, and, flows, length, is, measured, to, the, hydrologic, source, regardless, of, naming, convention, the, main, stem, of, the, kansas, river, for, example, is, 148, miles, 238, km, long, however, including, the, longest, headwaters, tributaries, the, 453, mile, 729, km, republican, river, and, the, 156, mile, 251, km, arikaree, river, brings, the, total, length, to, 749, miles, 1, 205, km, similar, naming, issues, are, encountered, with, the, platte, river, whose, longest, tributary, the, north, platte, river, is, more, than, twice, as, long, as, its, mainstream, the, missouri, s, headwaters, above, three, forks, extend, much, farther, upstream, than, the, main, stem, measured, to, the, farthest, source, at, brower, s, spring, the, jefferson, river, is, 298, miles, 480, km, long, thus, measured, to, its, highest, headwaters, the, missouri, river, stretches, for, 2, 639, miles, 4, 247, km, when, combined, with, the, lower, mississippi, the, missouri, and, its, headwaters, form, part, of, the, fourth, longest, river, system, in, the, world, at, 3, 745, miles, 6, 027, km, by, discharge, the, missouri, is, the, ninth, largest, river, of, the, united, states, after, the, mississippi, st, lawrence, ohio, columbia, niagara, yukon, detroit, and, st, clair, the, latter, two, however, are, sometimes, considered, part, of, a, strait, between, lake, huron, and, lake, erie, among, rivers, of, north, america, as, a, whole, the, missouri, is, thirteenth, largest, after, the, mississippi, mackenzie, st, lawrence, ohio, columbia, niagara, yukon, detroit, st, clair, fraser, slave, and, koksoak, as, the, missouri, drains, a, predominantly, semi, arid, region, its, discharge, is, much, lower, and, more, variable,

the, regional, slope, as, the, earth, plunged, into, the, ice, age, a, pre, illinoian, or, possibly, the, illinoian, glaciation, diverted, the, missouri, river, southeastward, toward, its, present, confluence, with, the, mississippi, and, caused, it, to, integrate, into, a, single, river, system, that, cuts, across, the, regional, slope, in, western, montana, the, missouri, river, is, thought, to, have, once, flowed, north, then, east, around, the, bear, paw, mountains, sapphires, are, found, in, some, spots, along, the, river, in, western, montana, advances, of, the, continental, ice,

reduced, this, to, 20, to, 25, million, short, tons, 18, to, 23, million, metric, tons, in, the, present, day, much, of, this, sediment, is, derived, from, the, river, s, floodplain, also, called, the, meander, belt, every, time, the, river, changed, course, it, would, erode, tons, of, soil, and, rocks, from, its, banks, however, damming, and, channeling, the, river, has, kept, it, from, reaching, its, natural, sediment, sources, along, most, of, its, course, reservoirs, along, the, missouri, trap, roughly, 36, 4, million, short, tons, 33, 0, million, metric, tons, of, sediment, each, year, despite, this, the, river, still, transports, more, than, half, the, total, silt, that, empties, into, the, gulf, of, mexico, the, mississippi, river, delta, formed, by, sediment, deposits, at, the, mouth, of, the, mississippi, constitutes, a, majority, of, sediments, carried, by, the, missouri, archaeological, evidence, especially, in, missouri, suggests, that, human, beings, first, inhabited, the, watershed, of, the, missouri, river, between, 10, 000, and, 12, 000, years, ago, at, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, during, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, large, migration, of, humans, were, taking, place, such, as, those, via, the, bering, land, bridge, between, the, americas, and, eurasia, over, centuries, the, missouri, river, formed, one, of, these, main, migration, paths, most, migratory, groups, that, passed, through, the, area, eventually, settled, in, the, ohio, valley, and, the, lower, mississippi, river, valley, but, many, including, the, mound, builders, stayed, along, the, missouri, becoming, the, ancestors, of, the, later, indigenous, peoples, of, the, great, plains, indigenous, peoples, of, north, america, who, have, lived, along, the, missouri, have, historically, had, access, to, ample, food, water, and, shelter, many, migratory, animals, naturally, inhabit, the, plains, area, before, they, were, hunted, by, colonists, and, native, americans, these, animals, such, as, the, buffalo, provided, meat, clothing, and, other, everyday, items, there, were, also, great, riparian, areas, in, the, river, s, floodplain, that, provided, habitat, for, herbs, and, other, staple, foods, no, written, records, from, the, tribes, and, peoples, of, the, pre, european, contact, period, exist, because, they, did, not, yet, use, writing, according, to, the, writings, of, early, colonists, some, of, the, major, tribes, along, the, missouri, river, included, the, otoe, missouria, omaha, ponca, brul, lakota, arikara, hidatsa, mandan, assiniboine, gros, ventres, and, blackfeet, in, this, pre, colonial, and, early, colonial, era, the, missouri, river, was, used, as, a, path, of, trade, and, transport, and, the, river, and, its, tributaries, often, formed, territorial, boundaries, most, of, the, indigenous, peoples, in, the, region, at, that, time, had, semi, nomadic, cultures, with, many, tribes, maintaining, different, summer, and, winter, camps, however, the, center, of, native, american, wealth, and, trade, lay, along, the, missouri, river, in, the, dakotas, region, on, its, great, bend, south, a, large, cluster, of, walled, mandan, hidatsa, and, arikara, villages, situated, on, bluffs, and, islands, of, the, river, was, home, to, thousands, and, later, served, as, a, market, and, trading, post, used, by, early, french, and, british, explorers, and, fur, traders, following, the, introduction, of, horses, to, missouri, river, tribes, possibly, from, feral, european, introduced, populations, natives, way, of, life, changed, dramatically, the, use, of, the, horse, allowed, them, to, travel, greater, distances, and, thus, facilitated, hunting, communications, and, trade, once, tens, of, millions, of, american, bison, commonly, called, buffalo, one, of, the, keystone, species, of, the, great, plains, and, the, ohio, valley, roamed, the, plains, of, the, missouri, river, basin, most, native, american, nations, in, the, basin, relied, heavily, on, the, bison, as, a, food, source, and, their, hides, and, bones, served, to, create, other, household, items, in, time, the, species, came, to, benefit, from, the, indigenous, peoples, periodic, controlled, burnings, of, the, grasslands, surrounding, the, missouri, to, clear, out, old, and, dead, growth, the, large, bison, population, of, the, region, gave, rise, to, the, term, great, bison, belt, an, area, of, rich, annual, grasslands, that, extended, from, alaska, to, mexico, along, the, eastern, flank, of, the, continental, divide, however, after, the, arrival, of, europeans, in, north, america, both, the, bison, and, the, native, americans, saw, a, rapid, decline, in, population, massive, over, hunting, for, sport, by, colonists, eliminated, bison, populations, east, of, the, mississippi, river, by, 1833, and, reduced, the, numbers, in, the, missouri, basin, to, a, mere, few, hundred, foreign, diseases, brought, by, settlers, such, as, smallpox, raged, across, the, land, decimating, native, american, populations, left, without, their, primary, source, of, sustenance, many, of, the, remaining, indigenous, people, were, forced, onto, resettlement, areas, and, reservations, often, at, gunpoint, in, may, 1673, the, french, canadian, explorer, louis, jolliet, and, the, french, explorer, jacques, marquette, left, the, settlement, of, st, ignace, on, lake, huron, and, traveled, down, the, wisconsin, and, mississippi, rivers, aiming, to, reach, the, pacific, ocean, in, late, june, jolliet, and, marquette, became, the, first, documented, european, discoverers, of, the, missouri, river, which, according, to, their, journals, was, in, full, flood, i, never, saw, anything, more, terrific, jolliet, wrote, a, tangle, of, entire, trees, from, the, mouth, of, the, pekistanoui, with, such, impetuosity, that, one, could, not, attempt, to, cross, it, without, great, danger, the, commotion, was, such, that, the, water, was, made, muddy, by, it, and, could, not, clear, itself, they, recorded, pekitanoui, or, pekistanoui, as, the, local, name, for, the, missouri, however, the, party, never, explored, the, missouri, beyond, its, mouth, nor, did, they, linger, in, the, area, in, addition, they, later, learned, that, the, mississippi, drained, into, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, not, the, pacific, as, they, had, originally, presumed, the, expedition, turned, back, about, 440, miles, 710, km, short, of, the, gulf, at, the, confluence, of, the, arkansas, river, with, the, mississippi, in, 1682, france, expanded, its, territorial, claims, in, north, america, to, include, land, on, the, western, side, of, the, mississippi, river, which, included, the, lower, portion, of, the, missouri, however, the, missouri, itself, remained, formally, unexplored, until, tienne, de, veniard, sieur, de, bourgmont, commanded, an, expedition, in, 1714, that, reached, at, least, as, far, as, the, mouth, of, the, platte, river, it, is, unclear, exactly, how, far, bourgmont, traveled, beyond, there, he, described, the, blond, haired, mandans, in, his, journals, so, it, is, likely, he, reached, as, far, as, their, villages, in, present, day, north, dakota, later, that, year, bourgmont, published, the, route, to, be, taken, to, ascend, the, missouri, river, the, first, known, document, to, use, the, name, missouri, river, many, of, the, names, he, gave, to, tributaries, mostly, from, the, native, tribes, that, lived, along, them, are, still, in, use, today, the, expedition, s, discoveries, eventually, found, their, way, to, cartographer, guillaume, delisle, who, used, the, information, to, create, a, map, of, the, lower, missouri, in, 1718, jean, baptiste, le, moyne, sieur, de, bienville, requested, that, the, french, government, bestow, upon, bourgmont, the, cross, of, st, louis, because, of, his, outstanding, service, to, france, bourgmont, had, in, fact, been, in, trouble, with, the, french, colonial, authorities, since, 1706, when, he, deserted, his, post, as, commandant, of, fort, detroit, after, poorly, handling, an, attack, by, the, ottawa, that, resulted, in, thirty, one, deaths, however, his, reputation, was, enhanced, in, 1720, when, the, pawnee, who, had, earlier, been, befriended, by, bourgmont, massacred, the, spanish, villasur, expedition, near, present, day, columbus, nebraska, on, the, missouri, river, temporarily, ending, spanish, encroachment, on, french, louisiana, bourgmont, established, fort, orleans, the, first, european, settlement, of, any, kind, on, the, missouri, river, near, present, day, brunswick, missouri, in, 1723, the, following, year, bourgmont, led, an, expedition, to, enlist, comanche, support, against, the, spanish, who, continued, to, show, interest, in, taking, over, the, missouri, in, 1725, bourgmont, brought, the, chiefs, of, several, missouri, river, tribes, to, visit, france, there, he, was, raised, to, the, rank, of, nobility, and, did, not, accompany, the, chiefs, back, to, north, america, fort, orleans, was, either, abandoned, or, its, small, contingent, massacred, by, native, americans, in, 1726, the, french, and, indian, war, erupted, when, territorial, disputes, between, france, and, great, britain, in, north, america, reached, a, head, in, 1754, by, 1763, france, s, army, in, north, america, had, been, defeated, by, a, combined, british, american, force, and, was, forced, to, sue, for, peace, in, the, treaty, of, paris, france, ceded, its, canadian, possessions, to, the, british, gaining, louisiana, from, the, spanish, in, return, initially, the, spanish, did, not, extensively, explore, the, missouri, and, let, french, traders, continue, their, activities, under, license, however, this, ended, after, news, of, incursions, by, trappers, working, for, the, hudson, s, bay, company, in, the, upper, missouri, river, watershed, was, brought, back, following, an, expedition, by, jacques, d, eglise, in, the, early, 1790s, in, 1795, the, spanish, chartered, the, company, of, discoverers, and, explorers, of, the, missouri, popularly, referred, to, as, the, missouri, company, and, offered, a, reward, for, the, first, person, to, reach, the, pacific, ocean, via, the, missouri, in, 1794, and, 1795, expeditions, led, by, jean, baptiste, truteau, and, antoine, simon, lecuyer, de, la, jonch, re, did, not, even, make, it, as, far, north, as, the, mandan, villages, in, central, north, dakota, arguably, the, most, successful, of, the, missouri, company, expeditions, was, that, of, james, mackay, and, john, evans, the, two, set, out, along, the, missouri, and, established, fort, charles, about, 20, miles, 32, km, south, of, present, day, sioux, city, as, a, winter, camp, in, 1795, at, the, mandan, villages, in, north, dakota, they, forcefully, expelled, several, british, traders, and, while, talking, to, the, populace, they, pinpointed, the, location, of, the, yellowstone, river, which, was, called, roche, jaune, yellow, rock, by, the, french, although, mackay, and, evans, failed, to, accomplish, their, original, goal, of, reaching, the, pacific, they, did, create, the, first, accurate, map, of, the, upper, missouri, river, in, 1795, the, young, united, states, and, spain, signed, pinckney, s, treaty, which, recognized, american, rights, to, navigate, the, mississippi, river, and, store, goods, for, export, in, new, orleans, three, years, later, spain, revoked, the, treaty, and, in, 1800, secretly, returned, louisiana, to, napoleonic, france, in, the, third, treaty, of, san, ildefonso, this, transfer, was, so, secret, that, the, spanish, continued, to, administer, the, territory, in, 1801, spain, restored, rights, to, use, the, mississippi, and, new, orleans, to, the, united, states, fearing, that, the, cutoffs, could, occur, again, president, thomas, jefferson, proposed, to, buy, the, port, of, new, orleans, from, france, for, 10, million, instead, faced, with, a, debt, crisis, napoleon, offered, to, sell, the, entirety, of, louisiana, including, the, missouri, river, for, 15, million, amounting, to, less, than, 3, per, acre, the, deal, was, signed, in, 1803, doubling, the, size, of, the, united, states, with, the, acquisition, of, the, louisiana, territory, in, 1803, jefferson, instructed, meriwether, lewis, to, explore, the, missouri, and, search, for, a, water, route, to, the, pacific, ocean, by, then, it, had, been, discovered, that, the, columbia, river, system, which, drains, into, the, pacific, had, a, similar, latitude, as, the, headwaters, of, the, missouri, river, and, it, was, widely, believed, that, a, connection, or, short, portage, existed, between, the, two, however, spain, balked, at, the, takeover, citing, that, they, had, never, formally, returned, louisiana, to, the, french, spanish, authorities, warned, lewis, not, to, take, the, journey, and, forbade, him, from, seeing, the, mackay, and, evans, map, of, the, missouri, although, lewis, eventually, managed, to, gain, access, to, it, meriwether, lewis, and, william, clark, began, their, famed, expedition, in, 1804, with, a, party, of, thirty, three, people, in, three, boats, although, they, became, the, first, europeans, to, travel, the, entire, length, of, the, missouri, and, reach, the, pacific, ocean, via, the, columbia, they, found, no, trace, of, the, northwest, passage, the, maps, made, by, lewis, and, clark, especially, those, of, the, pacific, northwest, region, provided, a, foundation, for, future, explorers, and, emigrants, they, also, negotiated, relations, with, numerous, native, american, tribes, and, wrote, extensive, reports, on, the, climate, ecology, and, geology, of, the, region, many, present, day, names, of, geographic, features, in, the, upper, missouri, basin, originated, from, their, expedition, as, early, as, the, 18th, century, fur, trappers, entered, the, extreme, northern, basin, of, the, missouri, river, in, the, hopes, of, finding, populations, of, beaver, and, river, otter, the, sale, of, whose, pelts, drove, the, thriving, north, american, fur, trade, they, came, from, many, different, places, some, from, the, canadian, fur, corporations, at, hudson, bay, some, from, the, pacific, northwest, see, also, maritime, fur, trade, and, some, from, the, midwestern, united, states, most, did, not, stay, in, the, area, for, long, as, they, failed, to, find, significant, resources, the, first, glowing, reports, of, country, rich, with, thousands, of, game, animals, came, in, 1806, when, meriwether, lewis, and, william, clark, returned, from, their, two, year, expedition, their, journals, described, lands, amply, stocked, with, thousands, of, buffalo, beaver, and, river, otter, and, also, an, abundant, population, of, sea, otters, on, the, pacific, northwest, coast, in, 1807, explorer, manuel, lisa, organized, an, expedition, which, would, lead, to, the, explosive, growth, of, the, fur, trade, in, the, upper, missouri, river, country, lisa, and, his, crew, traveled, up, the, missouri, and, yellowstone, rivers, trading, manufactured, items, in, return, for, furs, from, local, native, american, tribes, and, established, a, fort, at, the, confluence, of, the, yellowstone, and, a, tributary, the, bighorn, in, southern, montana, although, the, business, started, small, it, quickly, grew, into, a, thriving, trade, lisa, s, men, started, construction, of, fort, raymond, which, sat, on, a, bluff, overlooking, the, confluence, of, the, yellowstone, and, bighorn, in, the, fall, of, 1807, the, fort, would, serve, primarily, as, a, trading, post, for, bartering, with, the, native, americans, for, furs, this, method, was, unlike, that, of, the, pacific, northwest, fur, trade, which, involved, trappers, hired, by, the, various, fur, enterprises, namely, hudson, s, bay, fort, raymond, was, later, replaced, by, fort, lisa, at, the, confluence, of, the, missouri, and, yellowstone, in, north, dakota, a, second, fort, also, called, fort, lisa, was, built, downstream, on, the, missouri, river, in, nebraska, in, 1809, the, st, louis, missouri, fur, company, was, founded, by, lisa, in, conjunction, with, william, clark, and, pierre, choteau, among, others, in, 1828, the, american, fur, company, founded, fort, union, at, the, confluence, of, the, missouri, and, yellowstone, rivers, fort, union, gradually, became, the, main, headquarters, for, the, fur, trade, in, the, upper, missouri, basin, fur, trapping, activities, in, the, early, 19th, century, encompassed, nearly, all, of, the, rocky, mountains, on, both, the, eastern, and, western, slopes, trappers, of, the, hudson, s, bay, company, st, louis, missouri, fur, company, american, fur, company, rocky, mountain, fur, company, north, west, company, and, other, outfits, worked, thousands, of, streams, in, the, missouri, watershed, as, well, as, the, neighboring, columbia, colorado, arkansas, and, saskatchewan, river, systems, during, this, period, the, trappers, also, called, mountain, men, blazed, trails, through, the, wilderness, that, would, later, form, the, paths, pioneers, and, settlers, would, travel, by, into, the, west, transport, of, the, thousands, of, beaver, pelts, required, ships, providing, one, of, the, first, large, motives, for, river, transport, on, the, missouri, to, start, as, the, 1830s, drew, to, a, close, the, fur, industry, slowly, began, to, die, as, silk, replaced, beaver, fur, as, a, desirable, clothing, item, by, this, time, also, the, beaver, population, of, streams, in, the, rocky, mountains, had, been, decimated, by, intense, hunting, furthermore, frequent, native, american, attacks, on, trading, posts, made, it, dangerous, for, employees, of, the, fur, companies, in, some, regions, the, industry, continued, well, into, the, 1840s, but, in, others, such, as, the, platte, river, valley, declines, of, the, beaver, population, contributed, to, an, earlier, demise, the, fur, trade, finally, disappeared, in, the, great, plains, around, 1850, with, the, primary, center, of, industry, shifting, to, the, mississippi, valley, and, central, canada, despite, the, demise, of, the, once, prosperous, trade, however, its, legacy, led, to, the, opening, of, the, american, west, and, a, flood, of, settlers, farmers, ranchers, adventurers, hopefuls, financially, bereft, and, entrepreneurs, took, their, place, the, river, roughly, defined, the, american, frontier, in, the, 19th, century, particularly, downstream, from, kansas, city, where, it, takes, a, sharp, eastern, turn, into, the, heart, of, the, state, of, missouri, an, area, known, as, the, boonslick, as, first, area, settled, by, europeans, along, the, river, it, was, largely, populated, by, slave, owning, southerners, following, the, boone, s, lick, road, the, major, trails, for, the, opening, of, the, american, west, all, have, their, starting, points, on, the, river, including, the, california, mormon, oregon, and, santa, fe, trails, the, first, westward, leg, of, the, pony, express, was, a, ferry, across, the, missouri, at, st, joseph, missouri, similarly, most, emigrants, arrived, at, the, eastern, terminus, of, the, first, transcontinental, railroad, via, a, ferry, ride, across, the, missouri, between, council, bluffs, iowa, and, omaha, the, hannibal, bridge, became, the, first, bridge, to, cross, the, missouri, river, in, 1869, and, its, location, was, a, major, reason, why, kansas, city, became, the, largest, city, on, the, river, upstream, from, its, mouth, at, st, louis, true, to, the, then, ideal, of, manifest, destiny, over, 500, 000, people, set, out, from, the, river, town, of, independence, missouri, to, their, various, destinations, in, the, american, west, from, the, 1830s, to, the, 1860s, these, people, had, many, reasons, to, embark, on, this, strenuous, year, long, journey, economic, crisis, and, later, gold, strikes, including, the, california, gold, rush, for, example, for, most, the, route, took, them, up, the, missouri, to, omaha, nebraska, where, they, would, set, out, along, the, platte, river, which, flows, from, the, rocky, mountains, in, wyoming, and, colorado, eastward, through, the, great, plains, an, early, expedition, led, by, robert, stuart, from, 1812, to, 1813, proved, the, platte, impossible, to, navigate, by, the, dugout, canoes, they, used, let, alone, the, large, sidewheelers, and, sternwheelers, that, would, later, ply, the, missouri, in, increasing, numbers, one, explorer, remarked, that, the, platte, was, too, thick, to, drink, too, thin, to, plow, nevertheless, the, platte, provided, an, abundant, and, reliable, source, of, water, for, the, pioneers, as, they, headed, west, covered, wagons, popularly, referred, to, as, prairie, schooners, provided, the, primary, means, of, transport, until, the, beginning, of, regular, boat, service, on, the, river, in, the, 1850s, during, the, 1860s, gold, strikes, in, montana, colorado, wyoming, and, northern, utah, attracted, another, wave, of, hopefuls, to, the, region, although, some, freight, was, hauled, overland, most, transport, to, and, from, the, gold, fields, was, done, through, the, missouri, and, kansas, rivers, as, well, as, the, snake, river, in, western, wyoming, and, the, bear, river, in, utah, idaho, and, wyoming, it, is, estimated, that, of, the, passengers, and, freight, hauled, from, the, midwest, to, montana, over, 80, percent, were, transported, by, boat, a, journey, that, took, 150, days, in, the, upstream, direction, a, route, more, directly, west, into, colorado, lay, along, the, kansas, river, and, its, tributary, the, republican, river, as, well, as, pair, of, smaller, colorado, streams, big, sandy, creek, and, the, south, platte, river, to, near, denver, the, gold, rushes, precipitated, the, decline, of, the, bozeman, trail, as, a, popular, emigration, route, as, it, passed, through, land, held, by, often, hostile, native, americans, safer, paths, were, blazed, to, the, great, salt, lake, near, corinne, utah, during, the, gold, rush, period, which, led, to, the, large, scale, settlement, of, the, rocky, mountains, region, and, eastern, great, basin, as, settlers, expanded, their, holdings, into, the, great, plains, they, ran, into, land, conflicts, with, native, american, tribes, this, resulted, in, frequent, raids, massacres, and, armed, conflicts, leading, to, the, federal, government, creating, multiple, treaties, with, the, plains, tribes, which, generally, involved, establishing, borders, and, reserving, lands, for, the, indigenous, as, with, many, other, treaties, between, the, u, s, and, native, americans, they, were, soon, broken, leading, to, huge, wars, over, 1, 000, battles, big, and, small, were, fought, between, the, u, s, military, and, native, americans, before, the, tribes, were, forced, out, of, their, land, onto, reservations, conflicts, between, natives, and, settlers, over, the, opening, of, the, bozeman, trail, in, the, dakotas, wyoming, and, montana, led, to, red, cloud, s, war, in, which, the, lakota, and, cheyenne, fought, against, the, u, s, army, the, fighting, resulted, in, a, complete, native, american, victory, in, 1868, the, treaty, of, fort, laramie, was, signed, which, guaranteed, the, use, of, the, black, hills, powder, river, country, and, other, regions, surrounding, the, northern, missouri, river, to, native, americans, without, white, intervention, the, missouri, river, was, also, a, significant, landmark, as, it, divides, northeastern, kansas, from, western, missouri, pro, slavery, forces, from, missouri, would, cross, the, river, into, kansas, and, spark, mayhem, during, bleeding, kansas, leading, to, continued, tension, and, hostility, even, today, between, kansas, and, missouri, another, significant, military, engagement, on, the, missouri, river, during, this, period, was, the, 1861, battle, of, boonville, which, did, not, affect, native, americans, but, rather, was, a, turning, point, in, the, american, civil, war, that, allowed, the, union, to, seize, control, of, transport, on, the, river, discouraging, the, state, of, missouri, from, joining, the, confederacy, however, the, peace, and, freedom, of, the, native, americans, did, not, last, for, long, the, great, sioux, war, of, 1876, 77, was, sparked, when, american, miners, discovered, gold, in, the, black, hills, of, western, south, dakota, and, eastern, wyoming, these, lands, were, originally, set, aside, for, native, american, use, by, the, treaty, of, fort, laramie, when, the, settlers, intruded, onto, the, lands, they, were, attacked, by, native, americans, u, s, troops, were, sent, to, the, area, to, protect, the, miners, and, drive, out, the, natives, from, the, new, settlements, during, this, bloody, period, both, the, native, americans, and, the, u, s, military, won, victories, in, major, battles, resulting, in, the, loss, of, nearly, a, thousand, lives, the, war, eventually, ended, in, an, american, victory, and, the, black, hills, were, opened, to, settlement, native, americans, of, that, region, were, relocated, to, reservations, in, wyoming, and, southeastern, montana, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, a, great, number, of, dams, were, built, along, the, course, of, the, missouri, transforming, 35, percent, of, the, river, into, a, chain, of, reservoirs, river, development, was, stimulated, by, a, variety, of, factors, first, by, growing, demand, for, electricity, in, the, rural, northwestern, parts, of, the, basin, and, by, floods, and, droughts, that, plagued, rapidly, growing, agricultural, and, urban, areas, along, the, lower, missouri, river, small, privately, owned, hydroelectric, projects, have, existed, since, the, 1890s, but, the, large, flood, control, and, storage, dams, that, characterize, the, middle, reaches, of, the, river, today, were, not, constructed, until, the, 1950s, between, 1890, and, 1940, five, dams, were, built, in, the, vicinity, of, great, falls, to, generate, power, from, the, great, falls, of, the, missouri, a, chain, of, giant, waterfalls, formed, by, the, river, in, its, path, through, western, montana, black, eagle, dam, built, in, 1891, on, black, eagle, falls, was, the, first, dam, of, the, missouri, replaced, in, 1926, with, a, more, modern, structure, the, dam, was, little, more, than, a, small, weir, atop, black, eagle, falls, diverting, part, of, the, missouri, s, flow, into, the, black, eagle, power, plant, the, largest, of, the, five, dams, ryan, dam, was, built, in, 1913, the, dam, lies, directly, above, the, 87, foot, 27, m, big, falls, the, largest, waterfall, of, the, missouri, in, the, same, period, several, private, establishments, most, notably, the, montana, power, company, began, to, develop, the, missouri, river, above, great, falls, and, below, helena, for, power, generation, a, small, run, of, the, river, structure, completed, in, 1898, near, the, present, site, of, canyon, ferry, dam, became, the, second, dam, built, on, the, missouri, this, rock, filled, timber, crib, dam, generated, seven, and, a, half, megawatts, of, electricity, for, helena, and, the, surrounding, countryside, the, nearby, steel, hauser, dam, was, finished, in, 1907, but, failed, in, 1908, because, of, structural, deficiencies, causing, catastrophic, flooding, all, the, way, downstream, past, craig, at, great, falls, a, section, of, the, black, eagle, dam, was, dynamited, to, save, nearby, factories, from, inundation, hauser, was, rebuilt, in, 1910, as, a, concrete, gravity, structure, and, stands, to, this, day, holter, dam, about, 45, miles, 72, km, downstream, of, helena, was, the, third, hydroelectric, dam, built, on, this, stretch, of, the, missouri, river, when, completed, in, 1918, by, the, montana, power, company, and, the, united, missouri, river, power, company, its, reservoir, flooded, the, gates, of, the, mountains, a, limestone, canyon, which, meriwether, lewis, described, as, the, most, remarkable, clifts, that, we, have, yet, seen, the, tow, ing, and, projecting, rocks, in, many, places, seem, ready, to, tumble, on, us, in, 1949, the, u, s, bureau, of, reclamation, usbr, began, construction, on, the, modern, canyon, ferry, dam, to, provide, flood, control, to, the, great, falls, area, by, 1954, the, rising, waters, of, canyon, ferry, lake, submerged, the, old, 1898, dam, whose, powerhouse, still, stands, underwater, about, 1, 1, 2, miles, 2, 4, km, upstream, of, the, present, day, dam, uncertain, as, the, actions, of, a, jury, or, the, state, of, a, woman, s, mind, the, missouri, basin, suffered, a, series, of, catastrophic, floods, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, most, notably, in, 1844, 1881, and, 1926, 1927, in, 1940, as, part, of, the, great, depression, era, new, deal, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, usace, completed, fort, peck, dam, in, montana, construction, of, this, massive, public, works, project, provided, jobs, for, more, than, 50, 000, laborers, during, the, depression, and, was, a, major, step, in, providing, flood, control, to, the, lower, half, of, the, missouri, river, however, fort, peck, only, controls, runoff, from, 11, percent, of, the, missouri, river, watershed, and, had, little, effect, on, a, severe, snowmelt, flood, that, struck, the, lower, basin, three, years, later, this, event, was, particularly, destructive, as, it, submerged, manufacturing, plants, in, omaha, and, kansas, city, greatly, delaying, shipments, of, military, supplies, in, world, war, ii, flooding, damages, on, the, mississippi, missouri, river, system, were, one, of, the, primary, reasons, for, which, congress, passed, the, flood, control, act, of, 1944, opening, the, way, for, the, usace, to, develop, the, missouri, on, a, massive, scale, the, 1944, act, authorized, the, pick, sloan, missouri, basin, program, pick, sloan, plan, which, was, a, composite, of, two, widely, varying, proposals, the, pick, plan, with, an, emphasis, on, flood, control, and, hydroelectric, power, called, for, the, construction, of, large, storage, dams, along, the, main, stem, of, the, missouri, the, sloan, plan, which, stressed, the, development, of, local, irrigation, included, provisions, for, roughly, 85, smaller, dams, on, tributaries, in, the, early, stages, of, pick, sloan, development, tentative, plans, were, made, to, build, a, low, dam, on, the, missouri, at, riverdale, north, dakota, and, 27, smaller, dams, on, the, yellowstone, river, and, its, tributaries, this, was, met, with, controversy, from, inhabitants, of, the, yellowstone, basin, and, eventually, the, usbr, proposed, a, solution, to, greatly, increase, the, size, of, the, proposed, dam, at, riverdale, today, s, garrison, dam, thus, replacing, the, storage, that, would, have, been, provided, by, the, yellowstone, dams, because, of, this, decision, the, yellowstone, is, now, the, longest, free, flowing, river, in, the, contiguous, united, states, in, the, 1950s, construction, commenced, on, the, five, mainstem, dams, garrison, oahe, big, bend, fort, randall, and, gavins, point, proposed, under, the, pick, sloan, plan, along, with, fort, peck, which, was, integrated, as, a, unit, of, the, pick, sloan, plan, in, the, 1940s, these, dams, now, form, the, missouri, river, mainstem, system, the, flooding, of, lands, along, the, missouri, river, heavily, impacted, native, american, groups, whose, reservations, included, fertile, bottomlands, and, floodplains, especially, in, the, arid, dakotas, where, it, was, some, of, the, only, good, farmland, they, had, these, consequences, were, pronounced, in, north, dakota, s, fort, berthold, indian, reservation, where, 150, 000, acres, 61, 000, ha, of, land, was, taken, by, the, construction, of, garrison, dam, the, mandan, hidatsa, and, arikara, sanish, tribes, sued, the, federal, government, on, the, basis, of, the, 1851, treaty, of, fort, laramie, which, provided, that, reservation, land, could, not, be, taken, without, the, consent, of, both, the, tribes, and, congress, after, a, lengthy, legal, battle, the, tribes, were, coerced, in, 1947, to, accept, a, 5, 1, million, 55, million, today, settlement, for, the, land, just, 33, per, acre, in, 1949, this, was, increased, to, 12, 6, million, the, tribes, were, even, denied, the, right, to, use, the, reservoir, shore, for, grazing, hunting, fishing, and, other, purposes, the, six, dams, of, the, mainstem, system, chiefly, fort, peck, garrison, and, oahe, are, among, the, largest, dams, in, the, world, by, volume, their, sprawling, reservoirs, also, rank, among, the, biggest, of, the, nation, holding, up, to, 74, 1, million, acre, feet, 91, 4, km, 3, in, total, the, six, reservoirs, can, store, more, than, three, years, worth, of, the, river, s, flow, as, measured, below, gavins, point, the, lowermost, dam, this, capacity, makes, it, the, largest, reservoir, system, in, the, united, states, and, one, of, the, largest, in, north, america, in, addition, to, storing, irrigation, water, the, system, also, includes, an, annual, flood, control, reservation, of, 16, 3, million, acre, feet, 20, 1, km, 3, mainstem, power, plants, generate, about, 9, 3, billion, kwh, annually, equal, to, a, constant, output, of, almost, 1, 100, megawatts, along, with, nearly, 100, smaller, dams, on, tributaries, namely, the, bighorn, platte, kansas, and, osage, rivers, the, system, provides, irrigation, water, to, nearly, 7, 500, sq, mi, 19, 000, km, 2, of, land, the, table, at, left, lists, statistics, of, all, fifteen, dams, on, the, missouri, river, ordered, downstream, many, of, the, run, of, the, river, power, generation, dams, on, the, missouri, marked, in, yellow, form, very, small, impoundments, which, may, or, may, not, have, been, given, names, those, unnamed, are, left, blank, all, dams, are, on, the, upper, half, of, the, river, above, sioux, city, the, lower, river, is, uninterrupted, due, to, its, longstanding, use, as, a, shipping, channel, never, achieved, its, expectations, even, under, the, very, best, of, circumstances, it, was, never, a, huge, industry, richard, opper, former, executive, director, missouri, river, basin, association, boat, travel, on, the, missouri, began, with, the, wood, framed, canoes, and, bull, boats, that, native, americans, used, for, thousands, of, years, before, the, colonization, of, the, great, plains, introduced, larger, craft, to, the, river, the, first, steamboat, on, the, missouri, was, the, independence, which, started, running, between, st, louis, and, keytesville, missouri, around, 1819, by, the, 1830s, large, mail, and, freight, carrying, vessels, were, running, regularly, between, kansas, city, and, st, louis, and, many, traveled, even, farther, upstream, a, handful, such, as, the, western, engineer, and, the, yellowstone, could, make, it, up, the, river, as, far, as, eastern, montana, during, the, early, 19th, century, at, the, height, of, the, fur, trade, steamboats, and, keelboats, travelled, nearly, the, whole, length, of, the, missouri, from, montana, s, rugged, missouri, breaks, to, the, mouth, carrying, beaver, and, buffalo, furs, to, and, from, the, areas, the, trappers, frequented, this, resulted, in, the, development, of, the, missouri, river, mackinaw, which, specialized, in, carrying, furs, since, these, boats, could, only, travel, downriver, they, were, dismantled, and, sold, for, lumber, upon, their, arrival, at, st, louis, water, transport, increased, through, the, 1850s, with, multiple, craft, ferrying, pioneers, emigrants, and, miners, many, of, these, runs, were, from, st, louis, or, independence, to, near, omaha, there, most, of, these, people, would, set, out, overland, along, the, large, but, shallow, and, unnavigable, platte, river, which, pioneers, described, as, a, mile, wide, and, an, inch, deep, and, the, most, magnificent, and, useless, of, rivers, steamboat, navigation, peaked, in, 1858, with, over, 130, boats, operating, full, time, on, the, missouri, with, many, more, smaller, vessels, many, of, the, earlier, vessels, were, built, on, the, ohio, river, before, being, transferred, to, the, missouri, side, wheeler, steamboats, were, preferred, over, the, larger, sternwheelers, used, on, the, mississippi, and, ohio, because, of, their, greater, maneuverability, the, industry, s, success, however, did, not, guarantee, safety, in, the, early, decades, before, man, controlled, the, river, s, flow, its, sketchy, rises, and, falls, and, its, massive, amounts, of, sediment, which, prevented, a, clear, view, of, the, bottom, wrecked, some, 300, vessels, because, of, the, dangers, of, navigating, the, missouri, river, the, average, ship, s, lifespan, was, only, about, four, years, the, development, of, the, transcontinental, and, northern, pacific, railroads, marked, the, beginning, of, the, end, of, steamboat, commerce, on, the, missouri, outcompeted, by, trains, the, number, of, boats, slowly, dwindled, until, there, was, almost, nothing, left, by, the, 1890s, transport, of, agricultural, and, mining, products, by, barge, however, saw, a, revival, in, the, early, twentieth, century, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, missouri, river, has, been, extensively, engineered, for, water, transport, purposes, and, about, 32, percent, of, the, river, now, flows, through, artificially, straightened, channels, in, 1912, the, usace, was, authorized, to, maintain, the, missouri, to, a, depth, of, six, feet, 1, 8, meters, from, the, port, of, kansas, city, to, the, mouth, a, distance, of, 368, miles, 592, km, this, was, accomplished, by, constructing, levees, and, wing, dams, to, direct, the, river, s, flow, into, a, straight, narrow, channel, and, prevent, sedimentation, in, 1925, the, usace, began, a, project, to, widen, the, river, s, navigation, channel, to, 200, feet, 61, m, two, years, later, they, began, dredging, a, deep, water, channel, from, kansas, city, to, sioux, city, these, modifications, have, reduced, the, river, s, length, from, some, 2, 540, miles, 4, 090, km, in, the, late, 19th, century, to, 2, 341, miles, 3, 767, km, in, the, present, day, construction, of, dams, on, the, missouri, under, the, pick, sloan, plan, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, was, the, final, step, in, aiding, navigation, the, large, reservoirs, of, the, mainstem, system, help, provide, a, dependable, flow, to, maintain, the, navigation, channel, year, round, and, are, capable, of, halting, most, of, the, river, s, annual, freshets, however, high, and, low, water, cycles, of, the, missouri, notably, the, protracted, early, 21st, century, drought, in, the, missouri, river, basin, and, historic, floods, in, 1993, and, 2011, are, difficult, for, even, the, massive, mainstem, system, reservoirs, to, control, in, 1945, the, usace, began, the, missouri, river, bank, stabilization, and, navigation, project, which, would, permanently, increase, the, river, s, navigation, channel, to, a, width, of, 300, feet, 91, m, and, a, depth, of, nine, feet, 2, 7, meters, during, work, that, continues, to, this, day, the, 735, mile, 1, 183, km, navigation, channel, from, sioux, city, to, st, louis, has, been, controlled, by, building, rock, dikes, to, direct, the, river, s, flow, and, scour, out, sediments, sealing, and, cutting, off, meanders, and, side, channels, and, dredging, the, riverbed, however, the, missouri, has, often, resisted, the, efforts, of, the, usace, to, control, its, depth, in, 2006, the, u, s, coast, guard, stated, that, commercial, barge, tows, ran, aground, in, the, missouri, river, because, the, navigation, channel, had, been, severely, silted, the, usace, was, blamed, for, failing, to, maintain, the, channel, to, the, minimum, depth, in, 1929, the, missouri, river, navigation, commission, estimated, the, amount, of, goods, shipped, on, the, river, annually, at, 15, million, tons, 13, 6, million, metric, tons, providing, widespread, consensus, for, the, creation, of, a, navigation, channel, however, shipping, traffic, has, since, been, far, lower, than, expected, shipments, of, commodities, including, produce, manufactured, items, lumber, and, oil, averaged, only, 683, 000, tons, 616, 000, t, per, year, from, 1994, to, 2006, by, tonnage, of, transported, material, missouri, is, by, far, the, largest, user, of, the, river, accounting, for, 83, percent, of, river, traffic, while, kansas, has, 12, percent, nebraska, three, percent, and, iowa, two, percent, almost, all, of, the, barge, traffic, on, the, missouri, river, ships, sand, and, gravel, dredged, from, the, lower, 500, miles, 800, km, of, the, river, the, remaining, portion, of, the, shipping, channel, now, sees, little, to, no, use, by, commercial, vessels, for, navigation, purposes, the, missouri, river, is, divided, into, two, main, sections, the, upper, missouri, river, is, north, of, gavins, point, dam, the, last, hydroelectric, dam, of, fifteen, on, the, river, just, upstream, from, sioux, city, iowa, the, lower, missouri, river, is, the, 840, miles, 1, 350, km, of, river, below, gavins, point, until, it, meets, the, mississippi, just, above, st, louis, the, lower, missouri, river, has, no, hydroelectric, dams, or, locks, but, it, has, a, plethora, of, wing, dams, that, enable, barge, traffic, by, directing, the, flow, of, the, river, into, a, 200, foot, wide, 61, m, 12, foot, deep, 3, 7, m, channel, these, wing, dams, have, been, put, in, place, by, and, are, maintained, by, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, and, there, are, no, plans, to, construct, any, locks, to, replace, these, wing, dams, on, the, missouri, river, tonnage, of, goods, shipped, by, barges, on, the, missouri, river, has, seen, a, serious, decline, from, the, 1960s, to, the, present, in, the, 1960s, the, usace, predicted, an, increase, to, 12, million, short, tons, 11, mt, per, year, by, 2000, but, instead, the, opposite, has, happened, the, amount, of, goods, plunged, from, 3, 3, million, short, tons, 3, 0, mt, in, 1977, to, just, 1, 3, million, short, tons, 1, 2, mt, in, 2000, one, of, the, largest, drops, has, been, in, agricultural, products, especially, wheat, part, of, the, reason, is, that, irrigated, land, along, the, missouri, has, only, been, developed, to, a, fraction, of, its, potential, in, 2006, barges, on, the, missouri, hauled, only, 200, 000, short, tons, 180, 000, t, of, products, which, is, equal, to, the, daily, freight, traffic, on, the, mississippi, drought, conditions, in, the, early, 21st, century, and, competition, from, other, modes, of, transport, mainly, railroads, are, the, primary, reason, for, decreasing, river, traffic, on, the, missouri, the, usace, s, failure, to, consistently, maintain, the, navigation, channel, has, also, hampered, the, industry, efforts, are, being, made, to, revive, the, shipping, industry, on, the, missouri, river, because, of, the, efficiency, and, cheapness, of, river, transport, to, haul, agricultural, products, and, the, overcrowding, of, alternative, transportation, routes, solutions, such, as, expanding, the, navigation, channel, and, releasing, more, water, from, reservoirs, during, the, peak, of, the, navigation, season, are, under, consideration, drought, conditions, lifted, in, 2010, in, which, about, 334, 000, short, tons, 303, 000, t, were, barged, on, the, missouri, representing, the, first, significant, increase, in, shipments, since, 2000, however, flooding, in, 2011, closed, record, stretches, of, the, river, to, boat, traffic, wash, away, hopes, for, a, bounce, back, year, there, are, no, lock, and, dams, on, the, lower, missouri, river, but, there, are, plenty, of, wing, dams, that, jettie, out, into, the, river, and, make, it, harder, for, barges, to, navigate, in, contrast, the, upper, mississippi, has, 29, locks, and, dams, and, averaged, 61, 3, million, tons, of, cargo, annually, from, 2008, to, 2011, and, its, locks, are, closed, in, the, winter, historically, the, thousands, of, square, miles, that, comprised, the, floodplain, of, the, missouri, river, supported, a, wide, range, of, plant, and, animal, species, biodiversity, generally, increased, proceeding, downstream, from, the, cold, subalpine, headwaters, in, montana, to, the, temperate, moist, climate, of, missouri, today, the, river, s, riparian, zone, consists, primarily, of, cottonwoods, willows, and, sycamores, with, several, other, types, of, trees, such, as, maple, and, ash, average, tree, height, generally, increases, farther, from, the, riverbanks, for, a, limited, distance, as, land, next, to, the, river, is, vulnerable, to, soil, erosion, during, floods, because, of, its, large, sediment, concentrations, the, missouri, does, not, support, many, aquatic, invertebrates, however, the, basin, supports, about, 300, species, of, birds, and, 150, species, of, fish, some, of, which, are, endangered, such, as, the, pallid, sturgeon, the, missouri, s, aquatic, and, riparian, habitats, also, support, several, species, of, mammals, such, as, minks, river, otters, beavers, muskrats, and, raccoons, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, divides, the, missouri, river, watershed, into, three, freshwater, ecoregions, the, upper, missouri, lower, missouri, and, central, prairie, the, upper, missouri, roughly, encompassing, the, area, within, montana, wyoming, southern, alberta, and, saskatchewan, and, north, dakota, comprises, mainly, semiarid, shrub, steppe, grasslands, with, sparse, biodiversity, because, of, ice, age, glaciations, there, are, no, known, endemic, species, within, the, region, except, for, the, headwaters, in, the, rockies, there, is, little, precipitation, in, this, part, of, the, watershed, the, middle, missouri, ecoregion, extending, through, colorado, southwestern, minnesota, northern, kansas, nebraska, and, parts, of, wyoming, and, iowa, has, greater, rainfall, and, is, characterized, by, temperate, forests, and, grasslands, plant, life, is, more, diverse, in, the, middle, missouri, which, is, also, home, to, about, twice, as, many, animal, species, finally, the, central, prairie, ecoregion, is, situated, on, the, lower, part, of, the, missouri, encompassing, all, or, parts, of, missouri, kansas, oklahoma, and, arkansas, despite, large, seasonal, temperature, fluctuations, this, region, has, the, greatest, diversity, of, plants, and, animals, of, the, three, thirteen, species, of, crayfish, are, endemic, to, the, lower, missouri, since, river, commerce, and, industrial, development, began, in, the, 1800s, human, activity, has, severely, polluted, the, missouri, and, degraded, its, water, quality, most, of, the, river, s, floodplain, habitat, is, long, gone, replaced, by, irrigated, agricultural, land, development, of, the, floodplain, has, led, to, increasing, numbers, of, people, and, infrastructure, within, areas, at, high, risk, of, inundation, levees, have, been, constructed, along, more, than, a, third, of, the, river, to, keep, floodwater, within, the, channel, but, with, the, consequences, of, faster, stream, velocity, and, a, resulting, increase, of, peak, flows, in, downstream, areas, fertilizer, runoff, which, causes, elevated, levels, of, nitrogen, and, other, nutrients, is, a, major, problem, along, the, missouri, river, especially, in, iowa, and, missouri, this, form, of, pollution, also, affects, the, upper, mississippi, illinois, and, ohio, rivers, low, oxygen, levels, in, rivers, and, the, vast, gulf, of, mexico, dead, zone, at, the, end, of, the, mississippi, delta, are, both, results, of, high, nutrient, concentrations, in, the, missouri, and, other, tributaries, of, the, mississippi, channelization, of, the, lower, missouri, waters, has, made, the, river, narrower, deeper, and, less, accessible, to, riparian, flora, and, fauna, many, dams, and, bank, stabilization, projects, have, been, built, to, help, convert, 300, 000, acres, 1, 200, km, 2, of, missouri, river, floodplain, to, agricultural, land, channel, control, has, reduced, the, volume, of, sediment, transported, downstream, by, the, river, and, eliminated, critical, habitat, for, fish, birds, and, amphibians, by, the, early, 21st, century, declines, in, populations, of, native, species, prompted, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, to, issue, a, biological, opinion, recommending, restoration, of, river, habitats, for, federally, endangered, bird, and, fish, species, the, usace, began, work, on, ecosystem, restoration, projects, along, the, lower, missouri, river, in, the, early, 21st, century, because, of, the, low, use, of, the, shipping, channel, in, the, lower, missouri, maintained, by, the, usace, it, is, now, considered, feasible, to, remove, some, of, the, levees, dikes, and, wing, dams, that, constrict, the, river, s, flow, thus, allowing, it, to, naturally, restore, its, banks, by, 2001, there, were, 87, 000, acres, 350, km, 2, of, riverside, floodplain, undergoing, active, restoration, restoration, projects, have, re, mobilized, some, of, the, sediments, that, had, been, trapped, behind, bank, stabilization, structures, prompting, concerns, of, exacerbated, nutrient, and, sediment, pollution, locally, and, downstream, in, the, northern, gulf, of, mexico, a, 2010, national, research, council, report, assessed, the, roles, of, sediment, in, the, missouri, river,
