is, believed, to, come, from, mawuti, contraction, of, the, arabic, jaz, rat, al, mawt, meaning, island, of, death, maybe, due, to, the, dangerous, reefs, circling, the, island, and, corrupted, to, mayotta, in, portuguese, later, turned, into, french, however, the, local, name, is, mahore, and, the, arabic, etymology, is, doubtful, the, main, island, grande, terre, or, maore, geologically, the, oldest, of, the, comoro, islands, is, 39, kilometres, 24, mi, long, and, 22, kilometres, 14, mi, wide, and, its, highest, point, is, mount, benara, at, 660, metres, 2, 165, ft, above, sea, level, because, of, the, volcanic, rock, the, soil, is, relatively, rich, in, some, areas, a, coral, reef, encircling, much, of, the, island, ensures, protection, for, ships, and, a, habitat, for, fish, dzaoudzi, was, the, capital, of, mayotte, and, earlier, the, capital, of, all, the, colonial, comoros, until, 1977, when, the, capital, was, relocated, to, mamoudzou, on, the, main, island, of,

behind, the, reef, is, approximately, 1, 500, square, kilometres, 580, sq, mi, reaching, a, maximum, depth, of, about, 80m, it, is, described, as, the, largest, barrier, reef, lagoon, complex, within, the, southwestern, indian, ocean, mayotte, is, the, oldest, of, the, four, large, islands, of, the, comoros, archipelago, a, chain, of, land, emerging, from, a, crescent, shaped, submarine, relief, at, the, entrance, to, the, mozambique, channel, located, 295, km, 183, mi, west, of, madagascar, and, 67, km, 42, mi, southeast, of, anjouan, sometimes, visible, at, sunset, in, the, shade, it, is, composed, of, several, islands, and, islets, covered, with, lush, vegetation, the, two, largest, islands, are, grande, terre, and, petite, terre, backed, by, a, coral, reef, this, 160, km, 99, mi, long, coral, reef, surrounds, a, 1, 100, km, 2, 420, sq, mi, lagoon, one, of, the, largest, and, deepest, in, the, world, part, of, the, barrier, reef, features, a, double, barrier, that, is, rare, on, the, planet, it, protects, almost, all, of, mayotte, from, ocean, currents, and, waves, except, for, a, dozen, passes, including, one, in, the, east, called, the, s, pass, the, lagoon, which, averages, 5, to, 10, km, 3, 1, to, 6, 2, mi, wide, is, up, to, 100, m, 330, ft, deep, it, is, dotted, with, about, a, hundred, coral, islets, such, as, mtsamboro, this, reef, serves, as, a, refuge, for, boats, and, oceanic, fauna, the, volcanic, activity, that, created, the, islands, makes, the, soil, particularly, fertile, the, total, area, of, mayotte, is, about, 374, km, 2, 144, sq, mi, which, makes, it, by, far, the, smallest, french, overseas, department, after, martinique, which, is, three, times, larger, at, 1, 128, km, 2, 436, sq, mi, however, this, area, is, difficult, to, assess, accurately, given, the, number, of, small, uninhabited, islets, some, of, which, are, completely, underwater, at, high, tide, but, may, reveal, significant, areas, at, low, tide, the, main, islands, are, mayotte, is, a, primarily, volcanic, island, rising, steeply, from, the, bed, of, the, ocean, to, a, height, of, 660, metres, 2, 170, ft, on, mont, b, nara, openstreetmap, gives, this, as, 661, metres, 2, 169, ft, two, volcanic, centres, are, reported, a, southern, one, pic, chongui, 594, metres, 1, 949, ft, with, a, breached, crater, to, the, nw, and, a, northern, centre, mont, m,

the, two, structures, volcanic, activity, started, about, 7, 7, million, years, ago, in, the, south, ceasing, about, 2, 7, million, years, ago, in, the, north, activity, started, about, 4, 7, million, years, ago, and, lasted, until, about, 1, 4, million, years, ago, both, centres, had, several, phases, of, activity, the, most, recent, age, reported, for, an, ash, band, is, 7000, year, bp, the, november, 11, 2018, seismic, event, occurred, about, 15, miles, 24, km, off, the, coast, of, mayotte, it, was, recorded, by, seismograms, in, many, places, including, kenya, chile, new, zealand, canada, and, hawaii, located, almost, 11, 000, miles, 18, 000, km, away, the, seismic, waves, lasted, for, more, than, 20, minutes, but, despite, this, no, one, felt, it, subsequently, the, earthquake, swarm, has, been, linked, to, a, newly, discovered, undersea, volcano, located, 50, km, 31, mi, away, from, mayotte, at, a, depth, of, 3, 500, m, 11, 500, ft, mayotte, is, surrounded, by, a, typical, tropical, coral, reef, it, consists, in, a, large, outer, barrier, reef, enclosing, one, of, the, world, s, largest, and, deepest, lagoons, followed, by, a, fringing, reef, interrupted, by, many, mangroves, all, mayotte, waters, are, ruled, by, a, national, marine, park, and, many, places, are, natural, reserves, the, outer, coral, reef, is, 195, km, 121, mi, long, housing, 1, 500, km, 2, 580, sq, mi, of, lagoon, including, 7, 3, km, 2, 2, 8, sq, mi, of, mangrove, there, are, at, least, 250, different, species, of, coral, 760, tropical, fish, species, and, the, national, natural, heritage, inventory, inpn, has, no, fewer, than, 3, 616, marine, species, but, this, is, probably, a, far, cry, from, the, actual, count, as, this, region, of, the, world, is, still, poorly, inventoried, by, scientists, the, waters, of, mayotte, continue, to, harbour, many, species, unknown, to, science, and, allow, important, scientific, discoveries, each, year, mayotte, has, a, great, diversity, in, its, plant, life, more, than, 1, 300, species, are, recorded, half, of, them, being, endemic, making, this, island, one, of, the, richest, in, plant, diversity, in, the, world, compared, to, its, size, 15, of, the, island, is, classified, as, natural, reserve, however, the, primal, forest, now, covers, barely, 5, of, the, island, due, to, illegal, deforestation, just, like, many, volcanic, islands, mayotte, shelters, quite, a, limited, mammal, biodiversity, the, only, native, species, being, flying, foxes, pteropus, seychellensis, comorensis, however, there, are, 18, species, of, reptiles, 23, of, terrestrial, molluscs, 116, butterflies, 38, dragonflies, 50, grasshoppers, and, 150, beetles, by, 2021, there, were, 30, protected, areas, on, mayotte, totaling, 55, km, 2, 21, sq, mi, or, 13, 94, of, mayotte, s, land, area, and, 100, of, mayotte, s, marine, area, protected, areas, on, mayotte, include, mayotte, marine, natural, park, pointes, et, plages, de, saziley, et, charifou, and, il, t, mbouzi, national, nature, reserve, on, 3, may, 2021, the, french, government, created, the, forests, of, mayotte, national, nature, reserve, r, serve, naturelle, nationale, des, for, ts, de, mayotte, the, reserve, consists, of, 2, 801, ha, 6, 920, acres, in, six, mountain, forests, covering, 51, of, mayotte, s, reserve, forests, and, 7, 5, of, mayotte, s, total, land, area, areas, protected, by, the, reserve, include, mount, mtsap, r, mount, combani, mount, benara, and, mount, choungui, the, purpose, of, the, reserve, is, to, protect, the, relict, primary, forests, of, the, island, restore, the, island, s, secondary, forests, and, protect, the, island, s, native, flora, and, fauna, in, 1500, the, maore, sultanate, was, established, on, the, island, in, 1503, mayotte, was, observed, and, named, firstly, espirito, santo, by, portuguese, explorers, but, not, colonized, the, island, has, known, several, eras, of, wealth, especially, during, the, 11th, century, at, acoua, or, between, 9th, and, 12th, centuries, at, demb, ni, being, an, important, part, of, the, swahili, coast, culture, however, its, sister, island, anjouan, was, preferred, by, international, traders, due, to, its, better, suitability, to, large, boats, and, for, a, long, time, mayotte, remained, poorly, developed, compared, to, the, three, other, comoros, islands, often, being, targeted, by, pirates, and, malagasy, or, comorian, raids, in, the, early, 19th, century, mayotte, was, controlled, by, a, mercantile, family, that, claimed, omani, origins, the, sultans, of, mayotte, had, political, ties, with, the, anjouan, sultanate, during, this, period, mayotte, was, sparsely, populated, and, mainly, consisted, of, comorian, speakers, that, were, politically, aligned, with, the, local, sultan, and, the, malagasy, who, were, autonomous, in, 1832, mayotte, was, conquered, by, andriantsoly, former, king, of, iboina, on, madagascar, in, 1833, it, was, conquered, by, the, neighbouring, sultanate, of, mwali, moh, li, in, french, on, 19, november, 1835, mayotte, was, again, conquered, by, the, ndzuwani, sultanate, anjouan, sultanate, in, french, a, governor, was, installed, with, the, unusual, islamic, style, of, qadi, from, the, arabic, meaning, judge, however, in, 1836, it, regained, its, independence, under, a, last, local, sultan, andriantsoly, reconquered, the, island, in, 1836, but, his, depopulated, and, unfortified, island, was, in, a, weak, position, towards, the, sultans, of, comoros, malagasy, kings, and, pirates, looking, for, the, help, of, a, powerful, ally, he, began, to, negotiate, with, the, french, installed, in, the, nearby, malagasy, island, of, nosy, b, in, 1840, mayotte, was, purchased, by, france, in, 1841, and, integrated, to, the, crown, in, the, immediate, aftermath, slavery, was, abolished, and, laborers, were, imported, to, the, area, to, work, in, fields, and, plantations, the, abolition, of, slavery, led, to, several, slave, owning, elites, leaving, mayotte, as, their, authority, was, undermined, however, the, freed, slaves, were, often, subsequently, forced, to, work, under, harsher, conditions, for, the, french, government, or, colonists, in, their, plantations, additionally, many, of, the, imported, laborers, were, victims, of, the, slave, trade, mayotte, therefore, became, a, french, island, but, it, remained, an, island, with, a, sparse, population, due, to, decades, of, wars, as, well, as, by, the, exodus, of, former, elites, and, some, of, their, slaves, most, of, the, cities, were, abandoned, and, nature, regained, its, rights, over, the, old, plantations, the, french, administration, therefore, tried, to, repopulate, the, island, recalling, first, of, all, the, mayotte, exiles, or, refugees, in, the, region, comoros, madagascar, proposing, the, former, exiled, masters, return, in, exchange, for, compensation, then, by, inviting, wealthy, anjouan, families, to, come, and, set, up, trade, france, launched, some, first, major, works, such, as, the, realization, in, 1848, of, the, boulevard, des, crabes, connecting, the, rock, of, dzaoudzi, to, pamandzi, and, the, rest, of, petite, terre, as, it, had, done, in, the, west, indies, and, r, union, the, french, government, planned, to, make, mayotte, a, sugar, island, despite, the, steep, slopes, large, plantations, were, developed, 17, sugar, factories, were, built, and, hundreds, of, foreign, workers, mainly, african, in, particular, mozambic, makwas, hired, from, 1851, onwards, however, production, remained, mediocre, and, the, sugar, crisis, of, 1883, 1885, quickly, led, to, the, end, of, this, crop, in, mayotte, which, had, just, reached, its, peak, of, production, leaving, only, a, few, factory, ruins, some, of, which, are, still, visible, now, the, last, sugar, plant, to, be, closed, was, dzoumogn, in, 1955, the, best, preserved, and, now, heritage, is, soulou, in, the, west, of, the, island, at, the, berlin, conference, in, 1885, france, took, control, over, the, whole, comoros, archipelago, which, was, actually, already, ruled, by, french, traders, the, colony, took, the, name, of, mayotte, and, dependencies, in, 1898, two, cyclones, razed, the, island, to, the, ground, and, a, smallpox, epidemic, decimated, the, survivors, mayotte, had, to, start, from, the, beginning, once, again, and, the, french, government, had, to, repopulate, the, island, with, workers, from, mozambique, comoros, and, madagascar, the, sugar, industry, was, abandoned, replaced, by, vanilla, coffee, copra, sisal, then, fragrant, plants, such, as, vetiver, citronella, sandalwood, and, especially, ylang, ylang, which, later, became, one, of, the, symbols, of, the, island, mayotte, was, the, only, island, in, the, archipelago, that, voted, in, referendums, in, 1974, and, 1976, to, retain, its, link, with, france, and, forgo, independence, with, 63, 8, and, 99, 4, of, votes, respectively, un, general, assembly, resolutions, which, are, legally, non, binding, have, voted, not, to, recognise, france, s, continued, rule, of, mayotte, and, the, independent, comoros, have, never, ceased, to, claim, the, island, a, draft, 1976, united, nations, security, council, resolution, recognising, comorian, sovereignty, over, mayotte, supported, by, 11, of, the, 15, members, of, the, council, was, vetoed, by, france, it, was, the, only, time, as, of, 2020, that, france, cast, a, lone, veto, in, the, council, the, veto, was, criticized, because, france, was, a, party, to, the, dispute, before, the, security, council, and, consequently, should, have, abstained, from, voting, according, to, some, other, council, members, as, mentioned, the, united, nations, general, assembly, adopted, a, series, of, legally, non, binding, resolutions, on, mayotte, under, the, pro, comoros, title, question, of, the, comorian, island, of, mayotte, up, until, 1995, in, the, decades, since, 1995, the, subject, of, mayotte, has, not, been, discussed, by, the, general, assembly, and, all, the, following, referendums, over, mayotte, independence, have, shown, a, strong, will, of, mayotte, people, to, remain, french, mayotte, became, an, overseas, department, of, france, in, march, 2011, in, consequence, of, a, 29, march, 2009, referendum, the, outcome, was, a, 95, 5, percent, vote, in, favour, of, changing, the, island, s, status, from, a, french, overseas, community, to, become, france, s, 101st, d, partement, its, non, official, traditional, islamic, law, applied, in, some, aspects, of, the, day, to, day, life, will, be, gradually, abolished, and, replaced, by, the, uniform, french, civil, code, additionally, french, social, welfare, and, taxes, apply, in, mayotte, though, some, of, each, will, be, brought, in, gradually, comoros, continues, to, claim, the, island, while, criticising, the, french, military, base, there, in, 2018, the, department, experienced, civil, unrest, over, migration, from, the, comoros, the, politics, of, mayotte, takes, place, in, a, framework, of, a, parliamentary, representative, democratic, government, and, of, a, multi, party, system, whereby, the, president, of, the, departmental, council, is, the, head, of, the, local, assembly, executive, power, is, exercised, by, the, french, government, mayotte, also, sends, two, deputies, to, the, french, national, assembly, and, two, senators, to, the, french, senate, the, deputies, represent, mayotte, s, 1st, constituency, and, mayotte, s, 2nd, constituency, the, situation, of, mayotte, proved, to, be, awkward, for, france, while, a, significant, majority, of, the, local, population, did, not, want, to, join, the, comoros, in, becoming, independent, of, france, some, post, colonial, leftist, or, marxist, leninist, governments, voiced, criticism, of, mayotte, s, ongoing, ties, to, france, furthermore, the, peculiar, local, administration, of, mayotte, largely, ruled, by, customary, muslim, law, would, be, difficult, to, integrate, into, the, legal, structures, of, france, not, to, mention, the, costs, of, bringing, the, standards, of, living, to, levels, close, to, those, of, metropolitan, france, for, these, reasons, the, laws, passed, by, the, national, parliament, had, to, state, specifically, that, they, applied, to, mayotte, the, status, of, mayotte, was, changed, in, 2001, towards, one, very, close, to, the, status, of, the, departments, of, france, with, the, particular, designation, of, departmental, collectivity, this, change, was, approved, by, 73, of, voters, in, a, referendum, after, the, constitutional, reform, of, 2003, it, became, an, overseas, collectivity, while, retaining, the, title, departmental, collectivity, of, mayotte, mayotte, became, an, overseas, department, of, france, d, partement, d, outre, mer, dom, on, 31, march, 2011, following, the, result, of, the, march, 2009, mahoran, status, referendum, which, was, overwhelmingly, approved, by, around, 95, of, voters, becoming, an, overseas, department, will, mean, it, will, adopt, the, same, legal, and, social, system, as, used, in, the, rest, of, france, this, will, require, abandoning, some, customary, laws, adopting, the, standard, french, civil, code, and, reforming, the, judiciary, educational, social, and, fiscal, systems, and, will, take, place, over, a, period, of, about, 20, years, since, it, became, an, overseas, department, in, 2011, mayotte, possesses, a, single, local, assembly, officially, called, the, departmental, council, conseil, d, partemental, which, acts, both, as, a, regional, and, departmental, council, or, a, single, territorial, collectivity, this, was, a, unique, arrangement, at, the, time, but, french, guiana, and, martinique, adopted, this, arrangement, in, 2015, despite, its, domestic, constitutional, evolution, from, the, status, of, an, overseas, collectivity, to, that, of, an, overseas, department, effectively, becoming, a, full, constituent, territory, within, the, french, republic, with, regards, to, the, european, union, mayotte, remained, an, overseas, country, and, territory, oct, in, association, with, the, union, as, per, article, 355, 2, tfeu, and, not, a, constituent, territory, of, the, european, union, in, the, same, way, as, the, other, four, overseas, departments, however, following, a, directive, of, the, european, council, in, december, 2013, mayotte, became, an, outermost, region, of, the, european, union, on, 1, january, 2014, this, successful, agreement, between, the, 27, member, states, follows, a, petition, made, by, the, french, government, for, mayotte, to, become, an, integral, territory, of, the, european, union, nonetheless, benefiting, from, the, derogation, clause, applicable, in, existing, outermost, regions, namely, article, 349, tfeu, as, favoured, in, a, june, 2012, european, commission, opinion, on, mayotte, s, european, constitutional, status, in, recent, national, elections, mayotte, has, been, a, stronghold, for, the, right, wing, populist, national, rally, party, and, gave, its, presidential, candidate, marine, le, pen, her, highest, vote, percentage, in, the, 2022, french, presidential, election, first, round, defence, of, the, territory, is, the, responsibility, of, the, french, armed, forces, principally, carried, out,
