resources, africa, is, the, least, wealthy, continent, per, capita, and, second, least, wealthy, by, total, wealth, ahead, of, oceania, scholars, have, attributed, this, to, different, factors, including, geography, climate, corruption, colonialism, the, cold, war, and, neocolonialism, despite, this, low, concentration, of, wealth, recent, economic, expansion, and, the, large, and, young,

africa, is, highly, biodiverse, it, is, the, continent, with, the, largest, number, of, megafauna, species, as, it, was, least, affected, by, the, extinction, of, the, pleistocene, megafauna, however, africa, also, is, heavily, affected, by, a, wide, range, of, environmental, issues, including, desertification, deforestation, water, scarcity, and, pollution, these, entrenched, environmental, concerns, are, expected, to, worsen, as, climate, change, impacts, africa, the, un, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, has, identified, africa, as, the, continent, most, vulnerable, to, climate, change, the, history, of, africa, is, long, complex, and, varied, and, has, often, been, under, appreciated, by, the, global, historical, community, africa, particularly, eastern, africa, is, widely, accepted, to, be, the, place, of, origin, of, humans, and, the, hominidae, clade, also, known, as, the, great, apes, the, earliest, hominids, and, their, ancestors, have, been, dated, to, around, 7, million, years, ago, including, sahelanthropus, australopithecus, africanus, a, afarensis, homo, erectus, h, habilis, and, h, ergaster, the, earliest, homo, sapiens, modern, human, remains,

around, 350, 000, 260, 000, years, ago, africa, is, also, considered, by, anthropologists, to, be, the, most, genetically, diverse, continent, as, a, result, of, being, the, longest, inhabited, civilisations, such, as, ancient, egypt, kerma, punt, and, the, tichitt, tradition, emerged, in, north, east, and, west, africa, during, the, 4th, and, 3rd, millennia, bc, while, the, bantu,

been, connected, with, the, phoenician, word, afar, meaning, dust, but, a, 1981, hypothesis, has, asserted, that, it, stems, from, the, berber, word, ifri, plural, ifran, meaning, cave, in, reference, to, cave, dwellers, the, same, word, may, be, found, in, the, name, of, the, banu, ifran, from, algeria, and, tripolitania, a, berber, tribe, originally, from, yafran, also, known, as, ifrane, in,

of, the, sahara, has, historically, been, extremely, variable, with, its, area, rapidly, fluctuating, and, at, times, disappearing, depending, on, global, climatic, conditions, at, the, end, of, the, ice, ages, estimated, to, have, been, around, 10, 500, bce, the, sahara, had, again, become, a, green, fertile, valley, and, its, african, populations, returned, from, the, interior, and, coastal, highlands, in, sub, saharan, africa, with, rock, art, paintings, depicting, a, fertile, sahara, and, large, populations, discovered, in, tassili, n, ajjer, dating, back, perhaps, 10, millennia, however, the, warming, and, drying, climate, meant, that, by, 5000, bc, the, sahara, region, was, becoming, increasingly, dry, and, hostile, around, 3500, bc, due, to, a, tilt, in, the, earth, s, orbit, the, sahara, experienced, a, period, of, rapid, desertification, the, population, trekked, out, of, the, sahara, region, towards, the, nile, valley, below, the, second, cataract, where, they, made, permanent, or, semi, permanent, settlements, a, major, climatic, recession, occurred, lessening, the, heavy, and, persistent, rains, in, central, and, eastern, africa, since, this, time, dry,

forest, around, 4000, bc, the, saharan, climate, started, to, become, drier, at, an, exceedingly, fast, pace, this, climate, change, caused, lakes, and, rivers, to, shrink, significantly, and, caused, increasing, desertification, this, in, turn, decreased, the, amount, of, land, conducive, to, settlements, and, encouraged, migrations, of, farming, communities, to, the, more, tropical, climate, of, west, africa, during, the, first, millennium, bc, a, reduction, in, wild, grain, populations, related, to, changing, climate, conditions, facilitated, the, expansion, of, farming, communities, and, the, rapid, adoption, of, rice, cultivation, around, the, niger, river, by, the, first, millennium, bc, ironworking, had, been, introduced, in, northern, africa, around, that, time, it, also, became,

having, lasted, approximately, 2, 000, years, and, by, 500, bc, metalworking, began, to, become, commonplace, in, west, africa, ironworking, was, fully, established, by, roughly, 500, bc, in, many, areas, of, east, and, west, africa, although, other, regions, did, not, begin, ironworking, until, the, early, centuries, ce, copper, objects, from, egypt, north, africa, nubia, and, ethiopia, dating, from, around, 500, bc, have, been, excavated, in, west, africa, suggesting, that, trans, saharan, trade, networks, had, been, established, by, this, date, from, 3500, bc, nomes, ruled, by, nomarchs, coalesced, to, form, the, kingdoms, of, lower, egypt, and, upper, egypt, in, northeast, africa, around, 3100, bc, upper, egypt, conquered, lower, egypt, to, unify, egypt, under, the, 1st, dynasty, with, the, process, of, consolidation, and, assimilation, completed, by, the, time, of, the, 3rd, dynasty, who, formed, the, old, kingdom, of, egypt, in, 2686, bc, 62, 63, the, kingdom, of, kerma, emerged, around, this, time, to, become, the, dominant, force, in, nubia, controlling, territory, as, large, as, egypt, between, the, 1st, and, 4th, cataracts, of, the, nile, the, 4th, dynasty, oversaw, the, height, of, the, old, kingdom, and, constructed, many, great, pyramids, under, the, 6th, dynasty, power, gradually, decentralised, to, the, nomarchs, culminating, in, the, disintegration, of, the, kingdom, exacerbated, by, drought, and, famine, thus, commencing, the, first, intermediate, period, in, 2200, bc, this, shattered, state, would, last, until, 2055, bc, when, the, 11th, dynasty, based, in, thebes, conquered, the, others, to, form, the, middle, kingdom, of, egypt, with, the, 12th, dynasty, expanding, into, lower, nubia, at, the, expense, of, kerma, 68, 71, in, 1700, bc, the, middle, kingdom, fractured, in, two, ushering, in, the, second, intermediate, period, the, hyksos, a, militaristic, people, from, palestine, invaded, and, conquered, lower, egypt, while, kerma, coordinated, invasions, deep, into, egypt, to, reach, its, greatest, extent, in, 1550, bc, the, 18th, dynasty, expelled, the, hyksos, and, established, the, new, kingdom, of, egypt, using, the, advanced, military, technology, the, hyksos, had, brought, the, new, kingdom, conquered, the, levant, from, the, canaanites, mittani, amorites, and, hittites, and, extinguished, kerma, incorporating, nubia, into, the, empire, and, sending, the, egyptian, empire, into, its, golden, age, 73, internal, struggles, drought, famine, and, invasions, by, a, confederation, of, seafaring,

in, nubia, who, manoeuvred, into, power, in, upper, egypt, and, conquered, lower, egypt, in, 754, bc, to, form, the, kushite, empire, the, kushites, ruled, for, a, century, and, oversaw, a, revival, in, pyramid, building, until, they, were, driven, out, of, egypt, by, the, assyrians, in, 663, bc, in, reprisal, for, their, expansion, towards, the, assyrian, empire, the, assyrians, installed, a, puppet, dynasty, that, later, gained, independence, and, once, more, unified, egypt, until, they, were, conquered, by, the, achaemenid, empire, in, 525, bc, 77, egypt, regained, independence, under, the, 28th, dynasty, in, 404, bc, but, they, were, reconquered, by, the, achaemenids, in, 343, bc, the, conquest, of, achaemenid, egypt, by, alexander, the, great, in, 332, bc, marked, the, beginning, of, hellenistic, rule, and, the, installation, of, the, macedonian, ptolemaic, dynasty, in, egypt, 119, the, ptolemaics, lost, their, holdings, outside, of, africa, to, the, seleucids, in, the,

until, 1994, today, africa, contains, 54, sovereign, countries, since, independence, african, states, have, frequently, been, hampered, by, instability, corruption, violence, and, authoritarianism, the, vast, majority, of, african, states, are, republics, that, operate, under, some, form, of, the, presidential, system, of, rule, however, few, of, them, have, been, able, to, sustain, democratic, governments, on, a, permanent, basis, per, the, criteria, laid, out, by, l, hrmann, et, al, 2018, only, botswana, and, mauritius, have, been, consistently, democratic, for, the, entirety, of, their, post, colonial, history, most, african, countries, have, experienced, several, coups, or, periods, of, military, dictatorship, between, 1990, and, 2018, though, the, continent, as, a, whole, has, trended, towards, more, democratic, governance, upon, independence, an, overwhelming, majority, of, africans, lived, in, extreme, poverty, the, continent, suffered, from, the, lack, of, infrastructural, or, industrial, development, under, colonial, rule, along, with, political, instability, with, limited, financial, resources, or, access, to, global, markets, relatively, stable, countries, such, as, kenya, still, experienced, only, very, slow, economic, development, only, a, handful, of, african, countries, succeeded, in, obtaining, rapid, economic, growth, prior, to, 1990, exceptions, include, libya, and, equatorial, guinea, both, of, which, possess, large, oil, reserves, instability, throughout, the, continent, after, decolonization, resulted, primarily, from, marginalization, of, ethnic, groups, and, corruption, in, pursuit, of, personal, political, gain, many, leaders, deliberately, promoted, ethnic, conflicts, some, of, which, had, originated, during, the, colonial, period, such, as, from, the, grouping, of, multiple, unrelated, ethnic, groups, into, a, single, colony, the, splitting, of, a, distinct, ethnic, group, between, multiple, colonies, or, existing, conflicts, being, exacerbated, by, colonial, rule, for, instance, the, preferential, treatment, given, to, ethnic, hutus, over, tutsis, in, rwanda, during, german, and, belgian, rule, faced, with, increasingly, frequent, and, severe, violence, military, rule, was, widely, accepted, by, the, population, of, many, countries, as, means, to, maintain, order, and, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, a, majority, of, african, countries, were, controlled, by, military, dictatorships, territorial, disputes, between, nations, and, rebellions, by, groups, seeking, independence, were, also, common, in, independent, african, states, the, most, devastating, of, these, was, the, nigerian, civil, war, fought, between, government, forces, and, an, igbo, separatist, republic, which, resulted, in, a, famine, that, killed, 1, 2, million, people, two, civil, wars, in, sudan, the, first, lasting, from, 1955, to, 1972, and, the, second, from, 1983, to, 2005, collectively, killed, around, 3, million, both, were, fought, primarily, on, ethnic, and, religious, lines, cold, war, conflicts, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, also, contributed, to, instability, both, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, offered, considerable, incentives, to, african, political, and, military, leaders, who, aligned, themselves, with, the, superpowers, foreign, policy, as, an, example, during, the, angolan, civil, war, the, soviet, and, cuban, aligned, mpla, and, the, american, aligned, unita, received, the, vast, majority, of, their, military, and, political, support, from, these, countries, many, african, countries, became, highly, dependent, on, foreign, aid, the, sudden, loss, of, both, soviet, and, american, aid, at, the, end, of, the, cold, war, and, fall, of, the, ussr, resulted, in, severe, economic, and, political, turmoil, in, the, countries, most, dependent, on, foreign, support, there, was, a, major, famine, in, ethiopia, between, 1983, and, 1985, killing, up, to, 1, 2, million, people, which, most, historians, attribute, primarily, to, the, forced, relocation, of, farmworkers, and, seizure, of, grain, by, communist, derg, government, further, exacerbated, by, the, civil, war, in, 1994, a, genocide, in, rwanda, resulted, in, up, to, 800, 000, deaths, added, to, a, severe, refugee, crisis, and, fueled, the, rise, of, militia, groups, in, neighboring, countries, this, contributed, to, the, outbreak, of, the, first, and, second, congo, wars, which, were, the, most, devastating, military, conflicts, in, modern, africa, with, up, to, 5, 5, million, deaths, making, it, by, far, the, deadliest, conflict, in, modern, african, history, and, one, of, the, costliest, wars, in, human, history, various, conflicts, between, various, insurgent, groups, and, governments, continue, since, 2003, there, has, been, an, ongoing, conflict, in, darfur, sudan, which, peaked, in, intensity, from, 2003, to, 2005, with, notable, spikes, in, violence, in, 2007, and, 2013, 15, killing, around, 300, 000, people, total, the, boko, haram, insurgency, primarily, within, nigeria, with, considerable, fighting, in, niger, chad, and, cameroon, as, well, has, killed, around, 350, 000, people, since, 2009, most, african, conflicts, have, been, reduced, to, low, intensity, conflicts, as, of, 2022, however, the, tigray, war, from, 2020, to, 2022, killed, an, estimated, 300, 000, 500, 000, people, primarily, due, to, famine, overall, though, violence, across, africa, has, greatly, declined, in, the, 21st, century, with, the, end, of, civil, wars, in, angola, sierra, leone, and, algeria, in, 2002, liberia, in, 2003, and, sudan, and, burundi, in, 2005, the, second, congo, war, which, involved, 9, countries, and, several, insurgent, groups, ended, in, 2003, this, decline, in, violence, coincided, with, many, countries, abandoning, communist, style, command, economies, and, opening, up, for, market, reforms, which, over, the, course, of, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, promoted, the, establishment, of, permanent, peaceful, trade, between, neighboring, countries, see, capitalist, peace, improved, stability, and, economic, reforms, have, led, to, a, great, increase, in, foreign, investment, into, many, african, nations, mainly, from, china, which, further, spurred, economic, growth, between, 2000, and, 2014, annual, gdp, growth, in, sub, saharan, africa, averaged, 5, 02, doubling, its, total, gdp, from, 811, billion, to, 1, 63, trillion, constant, 2015, usd, north, africa, experienced, comparable, growth, rates, a, significant, part, of, this, growth, can, also, be, attributed, to, the, facilitated, diffusion, of, information, technologies, and, specifically, the, mobile, telephone, while, several, individual, countries, have, maintained, high, growth, rates, since, 2014, overall, growth, has, considerably, slowed, primarily, as, a, result, of, falling, commodity, prices, continued, lack, of, industrialization, and,
