the, southern, united, states, sometimes, dixie, also, referred, to, as, the, southern, states, the, american, south, the, southland, dixieland, or, simply, the, south, is, a, geographic, and, cultural, region, of, the, united, states, it, is, between, the, atlantic, ocean, and, the, western, united, states, with, the, midwestern, and, northeastern, united, states, to, its, north, and, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, mexico, to, its, south, historically, the, south, was, defined, as, all, states, south, of, the, 18th, century, mason, dixon, line, the, ohio, river, and, 36, 30, parallel, within, the, south, are, different, subregions, such, as, the, southeast, south, central, upper, south, and, deep, south, maryland, delaware, washington, d, c, and, northern, virginia, have, become, more, culturally, economically, and, politically, aligned, in, certain, aspects, with, the, northeastern, united, states, and, are, sometimes, identified, as, part, of, the, northeast, or, mid, atlantic, the, united, states, census, bureau, continues, to, define, all, four, places, as, formally, being, in, the, south, due, to, cultural, variations, across, the, region, some, scholars, have, proposed, definitions, of, the, south, that, do, not, coincide, neatly, with, state, boundaries, the, south, does, not, precisely, correspond, to, the, entire, geographic, south, of, the, united, states, but, primarily, includes, the, south, central, and, southeastern, states, for, example, california, which, is, geographically, in, the, southwestern, part, of, the, country, is, not, considered, part, of, the, south, however, the, geographically, southeastern, state, of, georgia, is, the, south, being, home, to, some, of, the, most, racially, diverse, areas, in, the, united, states, is, known, for, having, developed, its, own, distinct, culture, with, different, customs, fashion, architecture, musical, styles, and, cuisines, which, have, distinguished, it, in, many, ways, from, other, areas, of, the, united, states, from, 1860, to, 1861, eleven, southern, states, plus, an, additional, two, southern, states, that, were, claimed, and, partially, controlled, seceded, from, the, union, forming, the, confederate, states, of, america, following, the, american, civil, war, these, states, were, subsequently, added, back, to, the, union, sociological, research, indicates, that, southern, collective, identity, stems, from, political, historical, demographic, and, cultural, distinctiveness, from, the, rest, of, the, united, states, however, this, has, declined, since, around, the, late, 20th, century, with, many, southern, areas, becoming, a, melting, pot, of, cultures, and, people, ethnic, groups, in, the, south, were, the, most, diverse, among, american, regions, and, include, strong, european, especially, english, scots, irish, scottish, irish, french, and, spanish, african, and, native, american, ancestries, the, politics, and, economy, of, the, region, were, historically, dominated, by, a, small, rural, elite, the, historical, and, cultural, development, of, the, south, has, been, profoundly, influenced, by, the, institution, of, slave, labor, especially, in, the, deep, south, and, coastal, plain, areas, from, the, early, 1600s, to, mid, 1800s, this, includes, the, presence, of, a, large, proportion, of, african, americans, within, the, population, support, for, the, doctrine, of, states, rights, and, legacy, of, racism, magnified, by, the, civil, war, and, reconstruction, era, 1865, 1877, following, effects, included, thousands, of, lynchings, mostly, from, 1880, to, 1930, a, segregated, system, of, separate, schools, and, public, facilities, established, from, jim, crow, laws, that, remained, until, the, 1960s, and, the, widespread, use, of, poll, taxes, and, other, methods, to, deny, black, and, poor, people, the, ability, to, vote, or, hold, office, until, the, 1960s, scholars, have, characterized, pockets, of, the, southern, united, states, as, being, authoritarian, enclaves, from, reconstruction, until, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, when, looked, at, broadly, studies, have, shown, that, southerners, tend, to, be, more, conservative, than, most, non, southerners, with, liberalism, being, mostly, predominant, in, places, with, a, black, majority, or, urban, areas, in, the, south, although, historically, a, democratic, stronghold, most, states, in, the, region, have, in, recent, decades, come, to, favor, republicans, although, both, the, republican, and, democratic, party, are, competitive, in, certain, southern, swing, states, the, region, contains, almost, all, of, the, bible, belt, an, area, of, high, protestant, church, attendance, especially, evangelical, churches, such, as, the, southern, baptist, convention, historically, the, south, relied, heavily, on, agriculture, as, its, main, economic, base, and, was, predominantly, rural, until, after, world, war, ii, since, the, 1940s, the, region, has, become, more, economically, diversified, and, metropolitan, helping, attract, both, national, and, international, migrants, in, the, 21st, century, it, is, the, fastest, growing, region, in, the, united, states, with, houston, being, the, region, s, largest, city, the, south, is, a, diverse, meteorological, region, with, numerous, climatic, zones, including, temperate, sub, tropical, tropical, and, arid, though, the, south, generally, has, a, reputation, as, hot, and, humid, with, long, summers, and, short, mild, winters, most, of, the, south, except, for, the, areas, of, higher, elevations, and, areas, near, the, western, southern, and, some, northern, fringes, fall, in, the, humid, subtropical, climate, zone, crops, grow, readily, in, the, south, due, to, its, climate, consistently, providing, growing, seasons, of, at, least, six, months, before, the, first, frost, some, common, environments, include, bayous, and, swamplands, the, southern, pine, forests, the, warm, temperate, montane, forest, of, the, appalachians, the, savannas, of, the, southern, great, plains, and, the, subtropical, jungle, and, maritime, forests, along, the, atlantic, and, gulf, coasts, unique, flora, include, various, species, of, magnolia, rhododendron, cane, palm, and, oak, among, others, fauna, of, the, region, is, also, diverse, encompassing, a, plethora, of, amphibian, species, reptiles, such, as, the, green, anole, the, venomous, cottonmouth, snake, and, the, american, alligator, mammals, like, the, american, black, bear, the, swamp, rabbit, and, the, nine, banded, armadillo, and, birds, such, as, the, roseate, spoonbill, and, the, extinct, but, symbolic, carolina, parakeet, the, question, of, how, to, define, the, boundaries, and, subregions, in, the, south, has, been, the, focus, of, research, and, debate, for, centuries, as, defined, by, the, united, states, census, bureau, the, southern, region, of, the, united, states, includes, sixteen, states, as, of, 2010, an, estimated, 114, 555, 744, people, or, thirty, seven, percent, of, all, u, s, residents, lived, in, the, south, the, nation, s, most, populous, region, the, census, bureau, defined, three, smaller, divisions, the, council, of, state, governments, an, organization, for, communication, and, coordination, between, states, includes, in, its, south, regional, office, the, states, of, alabama, arkansas, florida, georgia, kentucky, louisiana, mississippi, missouri, north, carolina, oklahoma, south, carolina, tennessee, texas, virginia, and, west, virginia, other, terms, related, to, the, south, include, historically, the, south, was, defined, as, all, states, south, of, the, 18th, century, mason, dixon, line, the, ohio, river, and, 36, 30, parallel, newer, definitions, of, the, south, today, are, harder, to, define, due, to, cultural, and, sub, regional, differences, throughout, the, region, however, definitions, usually, refer, to, states, that, are, in, the, southeastern, and, south, central, geographic, region, of, the, united, states, although, not, included, in, the, census, definition, two, u, s, territories, located, southeast, of, florida, puerto, rico, and, the, u, s, virgin, islands, are, sometimes, included, as, part, of, the, southern, united, states, the, federal, aviation, administration, includes, puerto, rico, and, the, u, s, virgin, islands, as, part, of, the, south, as, does, the, agricultural, research, service, and, the, u, s, national, park, service, the, first, well, dated, evidence, of, human, occupation, in, the, south, united, states, occurs, around, 9500, bc, with, the, appearance, of, the, earliest, documented, americans, who, are, now, referred, to, as, paleo, indians, paleoindians, were, hunter, gatherers, that, roamed, in, bands, and, frequently, hunted, megafauna, several, cultural, stages, such, as, archaic, c, 8000, 1000, bc, and, the, woodland, c, 1000, bc, ad, 1000, preceded, what, the, europeans, found, at, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, the, mississippian, culture, the, mississippian, culture, was, a, complex, mound, building, native, american, culture, that, flourished, in, what, is, now, the, southeastern, united, states, from, approximately, 800, ad, to, 1500, ad, natives, had, elaborate, and, lengthy, trading, routes, connecting, their, main, residential, and, ceremonial, centers, extending, through, the, river, valleys, and, from, the, east, coast, to, the, great, lakes, some, noted, explorers, who, encountered, and, described, the, mississippian, culture, by, then, in, decline, included, p, nfilo, de, narv, ez, 1528, hernando, de, soto, 1540, and, pierre, le, moyne, d, iberville, 1699, native, american, descendants, of, the, mound, builders, include, alabama, apalachee, caddo, cherokee, chickasaw, choctaw, creek, guale, hitchiti, houma, and, seminole, peoples, all, of, whom, still, reside, in, the, south, other, peoples, whose, ancestral, links, to, the, mississippian, culture, are, less, clear, but, were, clearly, in, the, region, before, the, european, incursion, include, the, catawba, and, the, powhatan, the, arrival, of, european, settlers, caused, a, massive, population, decline, in, native, americans, due, to, europeans, unknowingly, spreading, diseases, that, the, natives, had, no, immunities, towards, numerous, violent, conflicts, and, forcibly, relocating, them, the, predominant, culture, of, the, original, southern, states, was, english, in, the, 17th, century, most, voluntary, immigrants, were, of, english, origin, and, settled, chiefly, along, the, eastern, coast, but, had, pushed, as, far, inland, as, the, appalachian, mountains, by, the, 18th, century, the, majority, of, early, english, settlers, were, indentured, servants, who, gained, freedom, after, working, off, their, passage, the, wealthier, men, typically, members, of, the, english, landed, gentry, who, paid, their, way, received, land, grants, known, as, headrights, to, encourage, settlement, the, spanish, and, french, established, settlements, in, florida, texas, and, louisiana, the, spanish, settled, florida, in, the, 16th, century, reaching, a, peak, in, the, late, 17th, century, but, the, population, was, small, because, the, spaniards, were, relatively, uninterested, in, agriculture, and, florida, had, no, mineral, resources, there, were, regional, differences, in, the, southern, colonies, with, the, three, main, regions, of, tidewater, the, deep, south, and, appalachia, the, first, region, to, be, settled, was, tidewater, containing, the, low, lying, plains, of, southeast, virginia, northeastern, north, carolina, southern, maryland, and, the, chesapeake, bay, the, next, region, to, be, settled, was, the, deep, south, beginning, in, province, of, carolina, and, later, the, province, of, georgia, the, last, region, to, be, settled, was, appalachia, also, settled, by, the, scotch, irish, king, charles, ii, of, england, granted, the, charter, of, carolina, in, 1663, for, land, south, of, the, british, colony, of, virginia, and, north, of, spanish, florida, he, granted, the, land, to, eight, lords, proprietor, charles, granted, the, land, in, return, for, their, financial, and, political, assistance, in, restoring, him, to, the, throne, in, 1660, the, granted, lands, included, all, or, part, of, the, present, day, u, s, states, of, north, carolina, tennessee, south, carolina, georgia, alabama, mississippi, and, florida, in, the, british, colonies, immigration, began, in, 1607, and, continued, until, the, outbreak, of, the, revolution, in, 1775, settlers, cleared, land, built, houses, and, outbuildings, and, on, their, own, farms, the, southern, rich, owned, large, plantations, that, dominated, export, agriculture, and, used, slaves, many, were, involved, in, the, labor, intensive, cultivation, of, tobacco, the, first, cash, crop, of, virginia, tobacco, exhausted, the, soil, quickly, requiring, that, farmers, regularly, clear, new, fields, they, used, old, fields, as, pasture, and, for, crops, such, as, corn, wheat, or, allowed, them, to, grow, into, woodlots, the, barbados, slave, code, served, as, the, basis, for, the, slave, codes, adopted, in, the, british, american, colonies, including, carolina, georgia, and, antigua, in, other, colonies, where, the, codes, are, not, an, exact, copy, such, as, virginia, and, maryland, the, influence, of, the, barbados, slave, code, can, be, traced, throughout, various, provisions, in, the, mid, to, late, 18th, century, large, groups, of, ulster, scots, later, called, the, scotch, irish, and, people, from, the, anglo, scottish, border, region, immigrated, and, settled, in, the, back, country, of, appalachia, and, the, piedmont, they, were, the, largest, group, of, non, english, immigrants, from, the, british, isles, before, the, american, revolution, in, the, 1980, census, 34, of, southerners, reported, that, they, were, of, english, ancestry, english, was, the, largest, reported, european, ancestry, in, every, southern, state, by, a, large, margin, the, early, colonists, engaged, in, warfare, trade, and, cultural, exchanges, those, living, in, the, backcountry, were, more, likely, to, encounter, creek, indians, cherokee, and, choctaws, and, other, regional, native, groups, the, oldest, university, in, the, south, the, college, of, william, mary, was, founded, in, 1693, in, virginia, it, pioneered, in, the, teaching, of, political, economy, and, educated, future, u, s, presidents, jefferson, monroe, and, tyler, all, from, virginia, indeed, the, entire, region, dominated, politics, in, the, first, party, system, era, for, example, four, of, the, first, five, presidents, washington, jefferson, madison, and, monroe, were, from, virginia, the, two, oldest, public, universities, are, also, in, the, south, the, university, of, north, carolina, 1789, and, the, university, of, georgia, 1785, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, the, southern, colonies, helped, embrace, the, patriot, cause, virginia, would, provide, leaders, such, as, commander, in, chief, george, washington, and, the, author, of, the, declaration, of, independence, thomas, jefferson, in, 1780, and, 1781, the, british, largely, halted, reconquest, of, the, northern, states, and, concentrated, on, the, south, where, they, were, told, there, was, a, large, loyalist, population, ready, to, leap, to, arms, once, the, royal, forces, arrived, the, british, took, control, of, savannah, and, charleston, capturing, a, large, american, army, in, the, process, and, set, up, a, network, of, bases, inland, although, there, were, loyalists, within, the, southern, colonies, they, were, concentrated, in, larger, coastal, cities, and, were, not, great, enough, in, number, to, overcome, the, revolutionaries, the, british, forces, at, the, battle, of, monck, s, corner, and, the, battle, of, lenud, s, ferry, consisted, entirely, of, loyalists, with, the, exception, of, the, commanding, officer, banastre, tarleton, both, white, and, black, loyalists, fought, for, the, british, at, the, battle, of, kemp, s, landing, in, virginia, led, by, nathanael, greene, and, other, generals, the, americans, engaged, in, fabian, tactics, designed, to, wear, down, the, british, invasion, force, and, to, neutralize, its, strong, points, one, by, one, there, were, numerous, battles, large, and, small, with, each, side, claiming, some, victories, by, 1781, however, british, general, cornwallis, moved, north, to, virginia, where, an, approaching, army, forced, him, to, fortify, and, await, rescue, by, the, british, navy, the, british, navy, did, arrive, but, so, did, a, stronger, french, fleet, and, cornwallis, was, trapped, american, and, french, armies, led, by, george, washington, forced, cornwallis, to, surrender, his, entire, army, in, yorktown, virginia, in, october, 1781, effectively, winning, the, north, american, part, of, the, war, the, revolution, provided, a, shock, to, slavery, in, the, south, and, other, regions, of, the, new, country, thousands, of, slaves, took, advantage, of, wartime, disruption, to, find, their, own, freedom, catalyzed, by, the, british, governor, dunmore, of, virginia, s, promise, of, freedom, for, service, many, others, were, removed, by, loyalist, owners, and, became, slaves, elsewhere, in, the, british, empire, between, 1770, and, 1790, there, was, a, sharp, decline, in, the, percentage, of, blacks, from, 61, to, 44, in, south, carolina, and, from, 45, to, 36, in, georgia, in, addition, some, slaveholders, were, inspired, to, free, their, slaves, after, the, revolution, they, were, moved, by, the, principles, of, the, revolution, along, with, quaker, and, methodist, preachers, who, worked, to, encourage, slaveholders, to, free, their, slaves, planters, such, as, george, washington, often, freed, slaves, by, their, wills, in, the, upper, south, more, than, 10, of, all, blacks, were, free, by, 1810, a, significant, expansion, from, pre, war, proportions, of, less, than, 1, free, cotton, became, dominant, in, the, lower, south, after, 1800, after, the, invention, of, the, cotton, gin, short, staple, cotton, could, be, grown, more, widely, this, led, to, an, explosion, of, cotton, cultivation, especially, in, the, frontier, uplands, of, georgia, alabama, and, other, parts, of, the, deep, south, as, well, as, riverfront, areas, of, the, mississippi, delta, migrants, poured, into, those, areas, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 19th, century, when, county, population, figures, rose, and, fell, as, swells, of, people, kept, moving, west, the, expansion, of, cotton, cultivation, required, more, slave, labor, and, the, institution, became, even, more, deeply, an, integral, part, of, the, south, s, economy, with, the, opening, up, of, frontier, lands, after, the, government, forced, most, native, americans, to, move, west, of, the, mississippi, there, was, a, major, migration, of, both, whites, and, blacks, to, those, territories, from, the, 1820s, through, the, 1850s, more, than, one, million, enslaved, africans, were, transported, to, the, deep, south, in, forced, migration, two, thirds, of, them, by, slave, traders, and, the, others, by, masters, who, moved, there, planters, in, the, upper, south, sold, slaves, in, excess, of, their, needs, as, they, shifted, from, tobacco, to, mixed, agriculture, many, enslaved, families, were, broken, up, as, planters, preferred, mostly, strong, males, for, field, work, two, major, political, issues, that, festered, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, caused, political, alignment, along, sectional, lines, strengthened, the, identities, of, north, and, south, as, distinct, regions, with, certain, strongly, opposed, interests, and, fed, the, arguments, over, states, rights, that, culminated, in, secession, and, the, civil, war, one, of, these, issues, concerned, the, protective, tariffs, enacted, to, assist, the, growth, of, the, manufacturing, sector, primarily, in, the, north, in, 1832, in, resistance, to, federal, legislation, increasing, tariffs, south, carolina, passed, an, ordinance, of, nullification, a, procedure, in, which, a, state, would, in, effect, repeal, a, federal, law, soon, a, naval, flotilla, was, sent, to, charleston, harbor, and, the, threat, of, landing, ground, troops, was, used, to, compel, the, collection, of, tariffs, a, compromise, was, reached, by, which, the, tariffs, would, be, gradually, reduced, but, the, underlying, argument, over, states, rights, continued, to, escalate, in, the, following, decades, the, second, issue, concerned, slavery, primarily, the, question, of, whether, slavery, would, be, permitted, in, newly, admitted, states, the, issue, was, initially, finessed, by, political, compromises, designed, to, balance, the, number, of, free, and, slave, states, the, issue, resurfaced, in, a, more, virulent, form, however, around, the, time, of, the, mexican, american, war, which, raised, the, stakes, by, adding, new, territories, primarily, on, the, southern, side, of, the, imaginary, geographic, divide, congress, opposed, allowing, slavery, in, these, territories, before, the, civil, war, the, number, of, immigrants, arriving, at, southern, ports, began, to, increase, although, the, north, continued, to, receive, the, most, immigrants, huguenots, were, among, the, first, settlers, in, charleston, along, with, the, largest, number, of, orthodox, jews, outside, of, new, york, city, numerous, irish, immigrants, settled, in, new, orleans, establishing, a, distinct, ethnic, enclave, now, known, as, the, irish, channel, germans, also, went, to, new, orleans, and, its, environs, resulting, in, a, large, area, north, of, the, city, along, the, mississippi, becoming, known, as, the, german, coast, still, greater, numbers, immigrated, to, texas, especially, after, 1848, where, many, bought, land, and, were, farmers, many, more, german, immigrants, arrived, in, texas, after, the, civil, war, where, they, created, the, brewing, industry, in, houston, and, elsewhere, became, grocers, in, numerous, cities, and, also, established, wide, areas, of, farming, by, 1840, new, orleans, was, the, wealthiest, city, in, the, country, and, the, third, largest, in, population, the, success, of, the, city, was, based, on, the, growth, of, international, trade, associated, with, products, being, shipped, to, and, from, the, interior, of, the, country, down, the, mississippi, river, new, orleans, also, had, the, largest, slave, market, in, the, country, as, traders, brought, slaves, by, ship, and, overland, to, sell, to, planters, across, the, deep, south, the, city, was, a, cosmopolitan, port, with, a, variety, of, jobs, that, attracted, more, immigrants, than, other, areas, of, the, south, because, of, lack, of, investment, however, construction, of, railroads, to, span, the, region, lagged, behind, the, north, people, relied, most, heavily, on, river, traffic, for, getting, their, crops, to, market, and, for, transportation, between, 1830, and, 1850, native, americans, were, removed, from, their, home, states, in, the, south, and, eastern, united, states, and, were, sent, to, oklahoma, by, 1856, the, south, had, lost, control, of, congress, and, was, no, longer, able, to, silence, calls, for, an, end, to, slavery, which, came, mostly, from, the, more, populated, free, states, of, the, north, the, republican, party, founded, in, 1854, pledged, to, stop, the, spread, of, slavery, beyond, those, states, where, it, already, existed, after, abraham, lincoln, was, elected, the, first, republican, president, in, 1860, seven, cotton, states, declared, their, secession, and, formed, the, confederate, states, of, america, before, lincoln, was, inaugurated, the, united, states, government, both, outgoing, and, incoming, refused, to, recognize, the, confederacy, and, when, the, new, confederate, president, jefferson, davis, ordered, his, troops, to, open, fire, on, fort, sumter, in, april, 1861, war, broke, out, only, the, state, of, kentucky, attempted, to, remain, neutral, and, it, could, only, do, so, briefly, when, lincoln, called, for, troops, to, suppress, what, he, referred, to, as, combinations, too, powerful, to, be, suppressed, by, the, ordinary, judicial, or, martial, means, four, more, states, decided, to, secede, and, join, the, confederacy, which, then, moved, its, capital, to, richmond, virginia, although, the, confederacy, had, large, supplies, of, captured, munitions, and, many, volunteers, it, was, slower, than, the, union, in, dealing, with, the, border, states, while, the, upland, south, border, states, of, kentucky, missouri, west, virginia, maryland, and, delaware, as, well, as, the, district, of, columbia, continued, to, permit, slavery, during, the, civil, war, they, remained, with, the, union, though, kentucky, and, missouri, both, had, rival, confederate, governments, that, formed, that, were, admitted, and, recognized, by, the, confederacy, though, early, in, the, war, the, confederacy, controlled, more, than, half, of, kentucky, and, the, southern, portion, of, missouri, by, march, 1862, the, union, largely, controlled, all, the, border, state, areas, had, shut, down, all, commercial, traffic, from, all, confederate, ports, had, prevented, european, recognition, of, the, confederate, government, and, was, poised, to, seize, new, orleans, the, rugged, mountainous, east, tennessee, region, attempted, to, rejoin, the, union, as, a, new, state, having, opposed, secession, and, slavery, compared, to, most, of, tennessee, in, the, four, years, of, war, 1861, 65, the, south, was, the, primary, battleground, with, all, but, two, of, the, major, battles, taking, place, on, southern, soil, union, forces, led, numerous, campaigns, into, the, western, confederacy, controlling, the, border, states, in, 1861, the, tennessee, river, the, cumberland, river, and, new, orleans, in, 1862, and, the, mississippi, river, in, 1863, in, the, east, however, the, confederate, army, under, robert, e, lee, beat, off, attack, after, attack, in, its, defense, of, their, capital, at, richmond, but, when, lee, tried, to, move, north, he, was, repulsed, and, nearly, captured, at, sharpsburg, 1862, and, gettysburg, 1863, the, confederacy, had, the, resources, for, a, short, war, but, was, unable, to, finance, or, supply, a, longer, war, it, reversed, the, traditional, low, tariff, policy, of, the, south, by, imposing, a, new, 15, tax, on, all, imports, from, the, union, the, union, blockade, stopped, most, commerce, from, entering, the, south, and, smugglers, avoided, the, tax, so, the, confederate, tariff, produced, too, little, revenue, to, finance, the, war, inflated, currency, was, the, solution, but, that, created, distrust, of, the, richmond, government, because, of, low, investment, in, railroads, the, southern, transportation, system, depended, primarily, on, river, and, coastal, traffic, by, boat, both, were, shut, down, by, the, union, navy, the, small, railroad, system, virtually, collapsed, so, that, by, 1864, internal, travel, was, so, difficult, that, the, confederate, economy, was, crippled, the, confederate, cause, was, hopeless, by, the, time, atlanta, fell, and, william, t, sherman, marched, through, georgia, in, late, 1864, but, the, rebels, fought, on, until, lee, s, army, surrendered, in, april, 1865, once, the, confederate, forces, surrendered, the, region, moved, into, the, reconstruction, era, 1865, 1877, in, a, partially, successful, attempt, to, rebuild, the, destroyed, region, and, grant, civil, rights, to, freed, slaves, southerners, who, were, against, the, confederate, cause, during, the, civil, war, were, known, as, southern, unionists, they, were, also, known, as, union, loyalists, or, lincoln, s, loyalists, within, the, eleven, confederate, states, states, such, as, tennessee, especially, east, tennessee, virginia, which, included, west, virginia, at, the, time, and, north, carolina, were, home, to, the, largest, populations, of, unionists, many, areas, of, southern, appalachia, harbored, pro, union, sentiment, as, well, as, many, as, 100, 000, men, living, in, states, under, confederate, control, would, serve, in, the, union, army, or, pro, union, guerrilla, groups, although, southern, unionists, came, from, all, classes, most, differed, socially, culturally, and, economically, from, the, regions, dominant, pre, war, planter, class, the, south, suffered, more, than, the, north, overall, as, the, union, strategy, of, attrition, warfare, meant, that, lee, could, not, replace, his, casualties, and, the, total, war, waged, by, sherman, sheridan, and, other, union, armies, devastated, the, infrastructure, and, caused, widespread, poverty, and, distress, the, confederacy, suffered, military, losses, of, 95, 000, soldiers, killed, in, action, and, 165, 000, who, died, of, disease, for, a, total, of, 260, 000, out, of, a, total, white, southern, population, at, the, time, of, around, 5, 5, million, based, on, 1860, census, figures, 8, of, all, white, males, aged, 13, to, 43, died, in, the, war, including, 6, in, the, north, and, about, 18, in, the, south, northern, military, deaths, were, greater, than, southern, military, deaths, in, absolute, numbers, but, were, two, thirds, smaller, in, terms, of, proportion, of, the, population, affected, after, the, civil, war, the, south, was, devastated, in, terms, of, infrastructure, and, economy, because, of, states, reluctance, to, grant, voting, rights, to, freedmen, congress, instituted, reconstruction, governments, it, established, military, districts, and, governors, to, rule, over, the, south, until, new, governments, could, be, established, many, white, southerners, who, had, actively, supported, the, confederacy, were, temporarily, disenfranchised, rebuilding, was, difficult, as, people, grappled, with, the, effects, of, a, new, labor, economy, of, a, free, market, in, the, midst, of, a, widespread, agricultural, depression, in, addition, the, limited, infrastructure, the, south, had, was, mostly, destroyed, by, the, war, at, the, same, time, the, north, was, rapidly, industrializing, to, avoid, the, social, effects, of, the, war, most, of, the, southern, states, initially, passed, black, codes, during, reconstruction, these, were, mostly, legally, nullified, by, federal, law, and, anti, confederate, legislatures, which, existed, for, a, short, time, during, reconstruction, there, were, thousands, of, people, on, the, move, as, african, americans, tried, to, reunite, families, separated, by, slave, sales, and, sometimes, migrated, for, better, opportunities, in, towns, or, other, states, other, freed, people, moved, from, plantation, areas, to, cities, or, towns, for, a, chance, to, get, different, jobs, at, the, same, time, whites, returned, from, refuges, to, reclaim, plantations, or, town, dwellings, in, some, areas, many, whites, returned, to, the, land, to, farm, for, a, while, some, freedpeople, left, the, south, altogether, for, states, such, as, ohio, and, indiana, and, later, kansas, thousands, of, others, joined, the, migration, to, new, opportunities, in, the, mississippi, and, arkansas, delta, bottomlands, and, texas, with, passage, of, the, 13th, amendment, to, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, which, outlawed, slavery, the, 14th, amendment, which, granted, full, u, s, citizenship, to, african, americans, and, the, 15th, amendment, which, extended, the, right, to, vote, to, african, american, males, african, americans, in, the, south, were, made, free, citizens, and, were, given, the, right, to, vote, under, federal, protection, white, and, black, republicans, formed, constitutional, conventions, and, state, governments, among, their, accomplishments, were, creating, the, first, public, education, systems, in, southern, states, and, providing, for, welfare, through, orphanages, hospitals, and, similar, institutions, northerners, came, south, to, participate, in, politics, and, business, some, were, representatives, of, the, freedmen, s, bureau, and, other, agencies, of, reconstruction, some, were, humanitarians, with, the, intent, to, help, black, people, some, were, adventurers, who, hoped, to, benefit, themselves, by, questionable, methods, they, were, all, condemned, with, the, pejorative, term, of, carpetbagger, some, southerners, would, also, take, advantage, of, the, disrupted, environment, and, made, money, off, various, schemes, including, bonds, and, financing, for, railroads, white, southerners, who, supported, reconstruction, policies, and, efforts, became, known, as, scalawags, secret, vigilante, organizations, such, as, the, ku, klux, klan, an, organization, sworn, to, perpetuate, white, supremacy, had, arisen, quickly, after, the, war, s, end, in, the, 1860s, and, used, lynching, physical, attacks, house, burnings, and, other, forms, of, intimidation, to, keep, african, americans, from, exercising, their, political, rights, although, the, first, klan, was, disrupted, by, prosecution, by, the, federal, government, in, the, early, 1870s, other, groups, persisted, by, the, mid, to, late, 1870s, some, upper, class, southerners, created, increasing, resistance, to, the, altered, social, structure, paramilitary, organizations, such, as, the, white, league, in, louisiana, 1874, the, red, shirts, in, mississippi, 1875, and, rifle, clubs, all, white, line, organizations, used, organized, violence, against, republicans, both, black, and, white, to, remove, republicans, from, political, office, repress, and, bar, black, voting, and, restore, the, democratic, party, to, power, in, 1876, white, democrats, regained, power, in, most, of, the, state, legislatures, they, began, to, pass, laws, designed, to, strip, african, americans, and, poor, whites, from, the, voter, registration, rolls, the, success, of, late, 19th, century, interracial, coalitions, in, several, states, inspired, a, reaction, among, some, white, democrats, who, worked, harder, to, prevent, both, groups, from, voting, despite, discrimination, many, blacks, became, property, owners, in, areas, that, were, still, developing, for, instance, 90, of, the, mississippi, s, bottomlands, were, still, frontier, and, undeveloped, after, the, war, by, the, end, of, the, century, two, thirds, of, the, farmers, in, mississippi, s, delta, bottomlands, were, black, they, had, cleared, the, land, themselves, and, often, made, money, in, early, years, by, selling, off, timber, tens, of, thousands, of, migrants, went, to, the, delta, both, to, work, as, laborers, to, clear, timber, for, lumber, companies, and, many, to, develop, their, own, farms, nonetheless, the, long, agricultural, depression, along, with, disenfranchisement, and, lack, of, access, to, credit, led, to, many, blacks, in, the, delta, losing, their, property, by, 1910, and, becoming, sharecroppers, or, landless, workers, over, the, following, decade, more, than, two, generations, of, free, african, americans, lost, their, stake, in, property, nearly, all, southerners, black, and, white, suffered, economically, as, a, result, of, the, civil, war, within, a, few, years, cotton, production, and, harvest, was, back, to, pre, war, levels, but, low, prices, through, much, of, the, 19th, century, hampered, recovery, they, encouraged, immigration, by, chinese, and, italian, laborers, into, the, mississippi, delta, while, the, first, chinese, entered, as, indentured, laborers, from, cuba, the, majority, came, in, the, early, 20th, century, neither, group, stayed, long, at, rural, farm, labor, the, chinese, became, merchants, and, established, stores, in, small, towns, throughout, the, delta, establishing, a, place, between, white, and, black, migrations, continued, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, among, both, blacks, and, whites, in, the, last, two, decades, of, the, 19th, century, about, 141, 000, blacks, left, the, south, and, more, after, 1900, totaling, a, loss, of, 537, 000, after, that, the, movement, increased, in, what, became, known, as, the, great, migration, from, 1910, to, 1940, and, the, second, great, migration, through, 1970, even, more, whites, left, the, south, some, going, to, california, for, opportunities, and, others, heading, to, northern, industrial, cities, after, 1900, between, 1880, and, 1910, the, loss, of, whites, totaled, 1, 243, 000, five, million, more, left, between, 1940, and, 1970, from, 1890, to, 1908, ten, of, the, eleven, former, confederate, states, along, with, oklahoma, upon, statehood, passed, disenfranchising, constitutions, or, amendments, that, introduced, voter, registration, barriers, such, as, poll, taxes, residency, requirements, and, literacy, tests, that, were, hard, for, minorities, to, meet, most, african, americans, most, mexican, americans, and, tens, of, thousands, of, poor, whites, were, disenfranchised, losing, the, vote, for, decades, in, some, states, grandfather, clauses, temporarily, exempted, white, illiterates, from, literacy, tests, the, numbers, of, voters, dropped, drastically, throughout, the, former, confederacy, as, a, result, this, can, be, seen, via, the, feature, turnout, in, presidential, and, midterm, elections, at, the, university, of, texas, politics, barriers, to, voting, alabama, which, had, established, universal, white, suffrage, in, 1819, when, it, became, a, state, also, substantially, reduced, voting, by, poor, whites, democrat, controlled, legislatures, passed, jim, crow, laws, to, segregate, public, facilities, and, services, including, transportation, while, african, americans, poor, whites, and, civil, rights, groups, started, litigation, against, such, provisions, in, the, early, 20th, century, for, decades, supreme, court, decisions, overturning, such, provisions, were, rapidly, followed, by, new, state, laws, with, new, devices, to, restrict, voting, most, blacks, in, the, former, confederacy, and, oklahoma, could, not, vote, until, 1965, after, passage, of, the, voting, rights, act, and, federal, enforcement, to, ensure, people, could, register, despite, increases, in, the, eligible, voting, population, with, the, inclusion, of, women, blacks, and, those, eighteen, and, over, throughout, this, period, turnout, in, ex, confederate, states, remained, below, the, national, average, throughout, the, 20th, century, not, until, the, late, 1960s, did, all, american, citizens, regain, protected, civil, rights, by, passage, of, legislation, following, the, leadership, of, the, american, civil, rights, movement, historian, william, chafe, has, explored, the, defensive, techniques, developed, inside, the, african, american, community, to, avoid, the, worst, features, of, jim, crow, as, expressed, in, the, legal, system, unbalanced, economic, power, and, intimidation, and, psychological, pressure, chafe, says, protective, socialization, by, blacks, themselves, was, created, inside, the, community, to, accommodate, white, imposed, sanctions, while, subtly, encouraging, challenges, to, those, sanctions, known, as, walking, the, tightrope, such, efforts, at, bringing, about, change, were, only, slightly, effective, before, the, 1920s, but, did, build, the, foundation, that, younger, african, americans, deployed, in, their, aggressive, large, scale, activism, during, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, white, democrats, in, the, south, had, created, state, constitutions, that, were, hostile, to, industry, and, business, development, with, anti, industrial, laws, extensive, from, the, time, new, constitutions, were, adopted, in, the, 1890s, banks, were, few, and, small, there, was, little, access, to, credit, traditional, agriculture, persisted, across, the, region, especially, in, alabama, and, florida, rural, minorities, held, control, in, many, state, legislatures, long, after, population, had, shifted, to, industrializing, cities, and, legislators, resisted, business, and, modernizing, interests, alabama, refused, to, redistrict, between, 1901, and, 1972, long, after, major, population, and, economic, shifts, to, cities, for, decades, birmingham, generated, the, majority, of, revenue, for, the, state, for, instance, but, received, little, back, in, services, or, infrastructure, in, the, late, 19th, century, texas, rapidly, expanded, its, railroad, network, creating, a, network, of, cities, connected, on, a, radial, plan, and, linked, to, the, port, of, galveston, strikes, and, labor, unrest, served, as, a, reflection, of, increasing, industry, in, 1885, texas, ranked, ninth, among, forty, states, in, number, of, workers, involved, in, strikes, 4, 000, for, the, six, year, period, it, ranked, fifteenth, seventy, five, of, the, one, hundred, strikes, chiefly, interstate, strikes, of, telegraphers, and, railway, workers, occurred, in, the, year, 1886, by, 1890, dallas, became, the, largest, city, in, texas, and, by, 1900, it, had, a, population, of, more, than, 42, 000, which, more, than, doubled, to, over, 92, 000, a, decade, later, dallas, was, the, harnessmaking, capital, of, the, world, and, a, center, of, other, manufacturing, as, an, example, of, its, ambitions, in, 1907, dallas, built, the, praetorian, building, fifteen, storeys, tall, and, the, first, skyscraper, west, of, the, mississippi, soon, to, be, followed, by, other, skyscrapers, texas, was, transformed, by, a, railroad, network, linking, five, important, cities, among, them, houston, with, its, nearby, port, at, galveston, dallas, fort, worth, san, antonio, and, el, paso, each, exceeded, fifty, thousand, in, population, by, 1920, with, the, major, cities, having, three, times, that, population, business, interests, were, ignored, by, the, southern, democrat, ruling, class, nonetheless, major, new, industries, started, developing, in, cities, such, as, atlanta, georgia, birmingham, alabama, and, dallas, fort, worth, and, houston, texas, growth, began, occurring, at, a, geometric, rate, birmingham, became, a, major, steel, producer, and, mining, town, with, major, population, growth, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 20th, century, the, first, major, oil, well, in, the, south, was, drilled, at, spindletop, near, beaumont, texas, on, the, morning, of, january, 10, 1901, other, oil, fields, were, later, discovered, nearby, in, arkansas, oklahoma, and, under, the, gulf, of, mexico, the, resulting, oil, boom, permanently, transformed, the, economy, of, the, west, south, central, states, and, produced, the, richest, economic, expansion, after, the, civil, war, in, the, early, 20th, century, invasion, of, the, boll, weevil, devastated, cotton, crops, in, the, south, producing, an, additional, catalyst, to, african, americans, decisions, to, leave, the, south, from, 1910, to, 1970, more, than, 6, 5, million, african, americans, left, the, south, in, the, great, migration, to, northern, and, western, cities, defecting, from, persistent, lynching, violence, segregation, poor, education, and, inability, to, vote, black, migration, transformed, many, northern, and, western, cities, creating, new, cultures, and, music, many, african, americans, like, other, groups, became, industrial, workers, others, started, their, own, businesses, within, the, communities, southern, whites, also, migrated, to, industrial, cities, like, chicago, detroit, oakland, and, los, angeles, where, they, took, jobs, in, the, booming, new, auto, and, defense, industry, later, the, southern, economy, was, dealt, additional, blows, by, the, great, depression, and, the, dust, bowl, after, the, wall, street, crash, of, 1929, the, economy, suffered, significant, reversals, and, millions, were, left, unemployed, beginning, in, 1934, and, lasting, until, 1939, an, ecological, disaster, of, severe, wind, and, drought, caused, an, exodus, from, texas, and, arkansas, the, oklahoma, panhandle, region, and, the, surrounding, plains, in, which, over, 500, 000, americans, were, homeless, hungry, and, jobless, thousands, would, leave, the, region, to, seek, economic, opportunities, along, the, west, coast, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, noted, the, south, as, the, number, one, priority, in, terms, of, need, of, assistance, during, the, great, depression, his, administration, created, programs, such, as, the, tennessee, valley, authority, in, 1933, to, provide, rural, electrification, and, stimulate, development, locked, into, low, productivity, agriculture, the, region, s, growth, was, slowed, by, limited, industrial, development, low, levels, of, entrepreneurship, and, the, lack, of, capital, investment, world, war, ii, marked, a, time, of, dramatic, change, within, the, south, from, an, economic, standpoint, as, new, industries, and, military, bases, were, developed, by, the, federal, government, providing, much, needed, capital, and, infrastructure, in, many, regions, people, from, all, parts, of, the, us, came, to, the, south, for, military, training, and, work, in, the, region, s, many, bases, and, new, industries, during, and, after, the, war, millions, of, hard, scrabble, farmers, both, white, and, black, left, agriculture, for, other, occupations, and, urban, jobs, the, united, states, began, mobilizing, for, war, in, a, major, way, in, the, spring, of, 1940, the, warm, weather, of, the, south, proved, ideal, for, building, 60, of, the, army, s, new, training, camps, and, nearly, half, the, new, airfields, in, all, 40, of, spending, on, new, military, installations, went, to, the, south, for, example, in, 1940, the, small, town, of, 1500, people, in, starke, florida, became, the, base, of, camp, blanding, by, march, 1941, 20, 000, men, were, constructing, a, permanent, camp, for, 60, 000, soldiers, money, flowed, freely, for, the, war, effort, as, over, 4, billion, went, into, military, facilities, in, the, south, and, another, 5, billion, into, defense, plants, major, shipyards, were, built, in, virginia, in, charleston, south, carolina, and, along, the, gulf, coast, huge, warplane, plants, were, opened, in, dallas, fort, worth, and, georgia, the, most, secret, and, expensive, operation, was, at, oak, ridge, tennessee, where, unlimited, amounts, of, locally, generated, electricity, were, used, to, prepare, uranium, for, the, atom, bomb, the, number, of, production, workers, doubled, during, the, war, most, training, centers, factories, and, shipyards, were, closed, in, 1945, but, not, all, and, the, families, that, left, hardscrabble, farms, remained, to, find, jobs, in, the, growing, urban, south, the, region, had, finally, reached, the, take, off, stage, into, industrial, and, commercial, growth, although, its, income, and, wage, levels, lagged, well, behind, the, national, average, nevertheless, as, george, b, tindall, notes, the, transformation, was, the, demonstration, of, industrial, potential, new, habits, of, mind, and, a, recognition, that, industrialization, demanded, community, services, per, capita, income, jumped, 140, from, 1940, to, 1945, compared, to, 100, elsewhere, in, the, united, states, southern, income, rose, from, 59, to, 65, dewey, grantham, says, the, war, brought, an, abrupt, departure, from, the, south, s, economic, backwardness, poverty, and, distinctive, rural, life, as, the, region, moved, perceptively, closer, to, the, mainstream, of, national, economic, and, social, life, since, 1970, the, proportion, of, the, african, american, population, living, in, the, south, stabilized, and, began, slightly, increasing, farming, shifted, from, cotton, and, tobacco, to, include, cattle, rice, soybeans, corn, and, other, foods, industrial, growth, increased, in, the, 1960s, and, greatly, accelerated, into, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, several, large, urban, areas, in, texas, georgia, and, florida, grew, to, over, four, million, people, rapid, expansion, in, industries, such, as, autos, telecommunications, textiles, technology, banking, and, aviation, gave, some, states, in, the, south, an, industrial, strength, to, rival, large, states, elsewhere, in, the, country, by, the, 2000, census, the, south, along, with, the, west, was, leading, the, nation, in, population, growth, with, this, growth, however, has, come, long, commute, times, and, air, pollution, problems, in, cities, such, as, dallas, houston, atlanta, austin, charlotte, and, others, that, rely, on, sprawling, development, and, highway, networks, in, the, 21st, century, and, especially, after, the, 2010, midterm, elections, the, republican, party, has, largely, dominated, the, south, both, at, the, state, and, federal, levels, as, of, 2024, republicans, control, both, houses, of, the, state, legislatures, of, 10, out, of, the, eleven, former, confederate, states, the, sole, exception, being, the, virginia, general, assembly, however, there, are, still, some, democratic, statewide, officeholders, in, the, south, such, as, kentucky, governor, andy, beshear, north, carolina, governor, roy, cooper, virginia, s, u, s, senators, mark, warner, and, tim, kaine, georgia, s, u, s, senators, raphael, warnock, and, jon, ossoff, and, west, virginia, s, u, s, senator, joe, manchin, in, 2019, fortune, 500, companies, headquartered, in, southern, states, included, texas, with, 50, virginia, with, 21, florida, with, 18, georgia, with, 17, north, carolina, with, 11, and, tennessee, with, 10, in, 2022, texas, led, the, nation, with, the, most, fortune, 500, company, headquarters, with, 53, this, economic, expansion, has, enabled, parts, of, the, south, to, report, some, of, the, lowest, unemployment, rates, in, the, united, states, even, with, certain, southern, states, and, areas, doing, well, economically, many, southern, states, and, areas, still, have, high, poverty, rates, when, compared, to, the, u, s, nationally, in, 2021, nine, out, of, the, ten, states, with, the, highest, poverty, rates, were, in, the, south, also, in, 2023, all, five, states, with, the, lowest, gdp, per, capita, were, in, the, south, mississippi, west, virginia, arkansas, alabama, and, south, carolina, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, south, changed, dramatically, it, saw, a, boom, in, its, service, economy, manufacturing, base, high, technology, industries, and, the, financial, sector, texas, in, particular, witnessed, dramatic, growth, and, population, change, with, the, dominance, of, the, energy, industry, and, tourism, industries, such, as, the, alamo, mission, in, san, antonio, tourism, in, florida, and, along, the, gulf, coast, also, grew, steadily, throughout, the, last, decades, of, the, 20th, century, numerous, new, automobile, production, plants, have, opened, in, the, region, or, are, soon, to, open, such, as, mercedes, benz, in, tuscaloosa, alabama, hyundai, in, montgomery,

sign, the, declaration, of, independence, and, then, fought, against, the, government, great, britain, along, with, the, middle, and, new, england, colonies, during, the, revolutionary, war, the, basis, for, much, of, southern, culture, derives, from, these, states, being, among, the, original, thirteen, colonies, and, from, much, of, the, population, of, the, colonial, south, having, ancestral, links, to, colonists, who, emigrated, west, southern, manners, and, customs, reflect, the, relationship, with, england, that, was, held, by, the, early, population, overall, the, south, has, had, lower, housing, values, lower, household, incomes, and, lower, cost, of, living, than, the, rest, of, the, united, states, these, factors, combined, with, the, fact, that, southerners, have, continued, to, maintain, strong, loyalty, to, family, ties, has, led, some, sociologists, to, label, white, southerners, an, ethnic, or, quasi, ethnic, group, though, this, interpretation, has, been, subject, to, criticism, on, the, grounds, that, proponents, of, the, view, do, not, satisfactorily, indicate, how, southerners, meet, the, criteria, of, ethnicity, the, predominant, culture, of, the, south, is, english, and, has, its, origins, with, the, settlement, of, the, region, by, large, groups, of, people, particularly, from, parts, of, west, midlands, southwest, england, and, southeast, england, such, as, sussex, shropshire, and, the, west, country, who, moved, to, the, tidewater, and, the, eastern, parts, of, the, deep, south, in, the, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, for,

descendants, identified, as, black, or, african, american, people, compose, the, united, states, second, largest, racial, minority, accounting, for, 12, 1, of, the, total, population, according, to, the, 2000, census, despite, jim, crow, era, outflow, to, the, north, the, majority, of, the, black, population, remains, concentrated, in, southern, states, and, has, heavily, contributed, to, the, cultural, blend, of, religion, food, art, and, music, see, spiritual, blues, jazz, r, b, soul, music, country, music, zydeco, bluegrass, and, rock, and, roll, that, characterizes, southern, culture, today, the, southern, planter, class, originated, from, the, english, landed, gentry, who, were, aristocratic, landowners, but, not, peers, or, titled, nobility, according, to, historian, g, e, mingay, the, gentry, were, landowners, whose, wealth, made, possible, a, certain, kind, of, education, a, standard, of, comfort, and, a, degree, of, leisure, and, a, common, interest, in, ways, of, spending, it, leisure, distinguished, gentry, from, businessmen, who, gained, their, wealth, through, work, the, gentry, did, not, work, their, income, came, largely, from, rents, paid, by, tenant, farmers, living, on, their, estates, the, concept, of, southern, chivalry, in, the, antebellum, south, originated, from, the, gentry, rank, of, gentleman, acting, as, a, chivalric, ideal, of, the, white, planter, class, supposedly, descended, from, the, knights, and, cavaliers, of, the, medieval, and, colonial, eras, in, previous, censuses, the, largest, ancestry, group, identified, by, southerners, was, english, or, mostly, english, with, 19, 618, 370, self, reporting, english, as, an, ancestry, on, the, 1980, census, followed, by, 12, 709, 872, listing, irish, and, 11, 054, 127, afro, american, almost, a, third, of, all, americans, who, claim, english, ancestry, can, be, found, in, the, american, south, and, over, a, quarter, of, all, southerners, claim, english, descent, as, well, the, south, has, had, a, majority, of, its, population, adhering, to, evangelical, protestantism, ever, since, the, second, great, awakening, although, the, upper, classes, often, stayed, anglican, episcopalian, or, presbyterian, the, first, great, awakening, and, the, second, great, awakening, from, about, 1742, to, about, 1850, generated, large, numbers, of, methodists, and, baptists, which, remain, the, two, main, christian, confessions, in, the, south, by, 1900, the, southern, baptist, convention, had, become, the, largest, protestant, denomination, in, the, whole, united, states, with, its, membership, concentrated, in, rural, areas, of, the, south, baptists, are, the, most, common, religious, group, followed, by, methodists, pentecostals, and, other, denominations, roman, catholics, historically, were, concentrated, in, maryland, louisiana, and, hispanic, areas, such, as, south, texas, and, south, florida, and, along, the, gulf, coast, the, great, majority, of, black, southerners, are, either, baptist, or, methodist, statistics, show, that, southern, states, have, the, highest, religious, attendance, figures, of, any, region, in, the, united, states, constituting, the, so, called, bible, belt, pentecostalism, has, been, strong, across, the, south, since, the, late, 19th, century, apart, from, its, climate, the, living, experience, in, the, south, increasingly, resembles, the, rest, of, the, nation, the, arrival, of, millions, of, northerners, and, westerners, mainly, since, the, late, 20th, century, has, reshaped, the, culture, of, major, metropolitan, areas, and, coastal, areas, while, hispanics, have, long, been, a, major, factor, in, texas, millions, more, have, arrived, in, other, southern, states, during, the, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, bringing, values, not, rooted, in, local, traditions, historian, raymond, mohl, emphasizes, the, role, of, nafta, in, lowering, trade, barriers, and, facilitating, large, scale, population, movements, he, adds, other, factors, such, as, ongoing, economic, crisis, in, mexico, new, more, liberal, immigration, policies, in, the, united, states, labor, recruitment, and, smuggling, that, have, produced, a, major, flow, of, mexican, and, hispanic, migration, to, the, southeast, that, region, s, low, wage, low, skill, economy, readily, hired, cheap, reliable, nonunion, labor, without, asking, applicants, too, many, questions, about, legal, status, richard, j, gonzales, argues, that, the, rise, of, la, raza, mexican, american, community, in, terms, of, numbers, and, influence, in, politics, education, and, language, and, cultural, rights, will, grow, rapidly, in, texas, by, 2030, when, demographers, predict, hispanics, will, outnumber, anglos, in, texas, however, thus, far, their, political, participation, and, the, latino, vote, have, been, low, so, the, potential, political, impact, is, much, higher, than, the, actual, one, thus, far, scholars, have, suggested, that, collective, identity, and, southern, distinctiveness, are, thus, declining, in, the, deep, south, particularly, when, defined, against, an, earlier, south, that, was, somehow, more, authentic, real, more, unified, and, distinct, on, the, other, hand, southerners, have, moved, west, in, large, numbers, especially, to, california, and, to, the, midwest, thus, journalist, michael, hirsh, proposed, that, aspects, of, southern, culture, have, spread, throughout, a, greater, portion, of, the, rest, of, the, united, states, in, a, process, termed, southernization, the, south, has, the, largest, african, american, population, by, region, the, south, has, largely, remained, a, black, and, white, region, while, the, other, regions, of, the, us, have, received, larger, amounts, of, hispanic, and, asian, immigrants, however, the, hispanic, population, has, seen, rapid, growth, in, certain, areas, of, the, south, particularly, in, south, florida, and, south, texas, the, upland,

regained, power, in, the, state, legislatures, and, began, to, make, voter, registration, more, complicated, to, reduce, black, voting, with, a, combination, of, intimidation, fraud, and, violence, by, paramilitary, groups, they, suppressed, black, voting, and, turned, republicans, out, of, office, from, 1890, to, 1908, ten, of, eleven, states, ratified, new, constitutions, or, amendments, that, effectively, disenfranchised, most, black, voters, and, many, poor, white, voters, this, disenfranchisement, persisted, for, six, decades, into, the, 20th, century, depriving, blacks, and, poor, whites, of, all, political, representation, because, they, could, not, vote, they, could, not, sit, on, juries, they, had, no, one, to, represent, their, interests, resulting, in, state, legislatures, consistently, underfunding, programs, and, services, such, as, schools, for, blacks, and, poor, whites, scholars, have, characterized, pockets, of, the, southern, united, states, as, being, authoritarian, enclaves, from, reconstruction, to, the, civil, rights, act, with, the, collapse, of, the, republican, party, in, nearly, all, parts, of, the, south, the, region, became, known, as, the, solid, south, and, the, democratic, party, after, 1900, moved, to, a, system, of, primaries, to, select, their, candidates, victory, in, a, primary, was, tantamount, to, election, from, the, late, 1870s, to, the, 1960s, only, rarely, was, a, state, or, national, southern, politician, a, republican, outside, from, southern, republican, strongholds, within, the, appalachian, mountain, districts, southern, republicans, during, this, period, would, continue, to, control, parts, of, the, appalachian, mountain, areas, and, compete, for, power, in, the, former, border, states, apart, from, a, few, states, such, as, the, byrd, machine, in, virginia, the, crump, machine, in, memphis, and, a, few, other, local, organizations, the, democratic, party, itself, was, very, lightly, organized, it, managed, primaries, but, party, officials, had, little, other, role, to, be, successful, a, politician, built, his, own, network, of, friends, neighbors, and, allies, reelection, was, the, norm, and, the, result, from, 1910, to, the, late, 20th, century, was, that, southern, democrats, in, congress, had, accumulated, seniority, and, automatically, took, the, chairmanships, of, all, committees, by, the, 1940s, the, supreme, court, began, to, find, disenfranchisement, measures, like, the, grandfather, clause, and, the, white, primary, unconstitutional, southern, legislatures, quickly, passed, other, measures, to, keep, blacks, disenfranchised, even, after, suffrage, was, extended, more, widely, to, poor, whites, because, white, democrats, controlled, all, the, southern, seats, in, the, u, s, congress, they, had, outsize, power, and, could, sidetrack, or, filibuster, efforts, to, pass, legislation, they, did, not, agree, with, increasing, support, for, civil, rights, legislation, by, the, national, democratic, party, beginning, in, 1948, caused, segregationist, southern, democrats, to, nominate, strom, thurmond, on, a, third, party, dixiecrat, ticket, in, 1948, these, dixiecrats, returned, to, the, party, by, 1950, but, southern, democrats, held, off, republican, inroads, in, the, suburbs, by, arguing, that, only, they, could, defend, the, region, from, the, onslaught, of, northern, liberals, and, the, civil, rights, movement, in, response, to, the, brown, v, board, of, education, ruling, of, 1954, 101, southern, congressmen, 19, senators, 82, house, members, of, which, 99, were, southern, democrats, and, 2, were, republicans, in, 1956, denounced, the, brown, decisions, as, a, clear, abuse, of, judicial, power, climaxes, a, trend, in, the, federal, judiciary, undertaking, to, legislate, in, derogation, of, the, authority, of, congress, and, to, encroach, upon, the, reserved, rights, of, the, states, and, the, people, the, manifesto,

when, democratic, president, lyndon, b, johnson, signed, into, law, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, and, the, voting, rights, act, of, 1965, which, ended, legal, segregation, and, provided,

the, states, of, the, deep, south, where, few, blacks, could, vote, before, the, 1965, voting, rights, act, pockets, of, resistance, to, integration, in, public, places, broke, out, in, violence, during, the, 1960s, by, the, shadowy, ku, klux, klan, which, caused, a, backlash, among, moderates, major, resistance, to, school, busing, extended, into, the, 1970s, national, republicans, such, as,

and, universally, watched, phenomenon, sclc, student, activists, and, smaller, local, organizations, staged, demonstrations, across, the, south, national, attention, focused, on, birmingham, alabama,

connor, unleashed, billy, clubs, police, dogs, and, high, pressure, water, hoses, to, disperse, and, punish, the, young, demonstrators, with, a, brutality, that, horrified, the, nation, it, was, very,

restore, order, in, birmingham, the, result, in, birmingham, was, a, compromise, by, which, the, new, mayor, opened, the, library, golf, courses, and, other, city, facilities, to, both, races,

finally, passed, its, version, on, june, 19, by, a, vote, of, 73, to, 27, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, was, the, most, powerful, affirmation, of, equal, rights, ever, made, by, congress, it,

johnson, on, july, 2, 1964, it, was, widely, accepted, across, the, nation, there, was, only, a, scattering, of, diehard, opposition, typified, by, restaurant, owner, lester, maddox, in, georgia, who, became, governor, but, the, great, majority, of, restaurants, and, hotels, in, georgia, followed, the, new, law, as, the, business, community, realized, that, peaceful, integration, was, the, only,
