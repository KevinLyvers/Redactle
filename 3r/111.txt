intermittent, tipitapa, river, feeds, lake, nicaragua, lake, when, lake, managua, has, high, water, the, lake, drains, via, the, san, juan, river, flowing, east, to, the, caribbean, sea, historically, making, the, city, granada, on, the, northwest, shore, an, atlantic, port, although, granada, as, well, as, the, entire, lake, is, closer, to, the, pacific, ocean, geographically, the, pacific, is, near, enough, to, be, seen, from, the, mountains, of, the, largest, island, in, the, lake, ometepe, the, lake, has, a, history, of, caribbean, pirates, who, assaulted, granada, on, three, occasions, before, construction, of, the, panama, canal, a, stagecoach, line, owned, by, cornelius, vanderbilt, s, accessory, transit, company, connected, the, lake, with, the, pacific, across, the, low, hills, of, the, narrow, isthmus, of, rivas, plans, were, made, to, take, advantage, of, this, route, to, build, an, interoceanic, canal, the, nicaragua, canal, but, the, panama, canal, was, built, instead, in, order, to, quell, competition, with, the, panama, canal, the, u, s, secured, all, rights, to, a, canal, along, this, route, in, the, bryan, chamorro, treaty, of, 1916, however, since, this, treaty, was, mutually, rescinded, by, the, united, states, and, nicaragua, in, 1970, the, idea, of, another, canal, in, nicaragua, still, periodically, resurfaced, such, as, the, ecocanal, proposal, in, 2014, the, government, of, nicaragua, offered, a, 50, year, concession, to, the, hong, kong, nicaragua, canal, development, investment, company, hknd, to, build, a, canal, across, nicaragua, at, a, cost, of, us, 40, billion, with, construction, expected, to, begin, in, december, 2014, and, complete, in, 2019, protests, against, the, ecological, and, social, effects, of, the, canal, as, well, as, questions, about, financing, led, to, doubts, about, the, project, and, in, the, end, construction, never, began, lake, nicaragua, despite, being, a, freshwater, lake, has, sawfish, tarpon, and, sharks, initially, scientists, thought, the, sharks, in, the, lake, were, an, endemic, species, the, lake, nicaragua, shark, carcharhinus, nicaraguensis, in, 1961, following, comparisons, of, specimens, it, was, synonymized, with, the, widespread, bull, shark, c, leucas, a, species, also, known, for, entering, freshwater, elsewhere, around, the, world, it, had, been, presumed, that, the, sharks, were, trapped, within, the, lake, but, this, was, found, to, be, incorrect, in, the, late, 1960s, when, it, was, discovered, that, they, were, able, to, jump, along, the, rapids, of, the, san, juan, river, which, connects, lake, nicaragua, with, the, caribbean, sea, almost, like, salmon, as, evidence, of, these, movements, bull, sharks, tagged, inside, the, lake, have, later, been, caught, in, the, open, ocean, and, vice, versa, with, some, taking, as, little, as, 7, 11, days, to, complete, the, journey, numerous, other, species, of, fish, live, in, the, lake, including, at, least, 16, cichlids, that, are, endemic, to, the, general, region, none, of, these, are, strictly, endemic, to, lake, nicaragua, although, amphilophus, labiatus, is, native, only, to, lake, nicaragua, and, lake, managua, a, non, native, cichlid, a, tilapia, is, used, widely, in, aquaculture, within, the, lake, owing, to, the, large, amount, of, waste, they, produce, and, the, risk, of, introducing, diseases, to, which, the, native, fish, species, have, no, resistance, they, are, potentially, a, serious, threat, to, the, lake, s, ecosystem, the, nation, s, largest, source, of, freshwater, nicaraguans, call, it, lago, cocibolca, or, mar, dulce, literally, sweet, sea, in, spanish, freshwater, is, agua, dulce, the, lake, has, sizeable, waves, driven, by, the, easterly, winds, blowing, west, to, the, pacific, ocean, the, lake, holds, ometepe, and, zapatera, which, are, both, volcanic, islands, as, well, as, the, archipelago, of, the, solentiname, islands, the, lake, has, a, reputation, for, periodically, powerful, storms, in, the, past, 37, years, considerable, concern, has, been, expressed, about, the, ecological, condition, of, lake, nicaragua, in, 1981, the, ministry, of, the, environment, and, natural, resources, marena, conducted, an, environmental, assessment, study, and, found, that, half, of, the, water, sources, sampled, were, seriously, polluted, by, sewage, it, was, found, that, 32, tons, 70, 000, pounds, of, raw, sewage, were, being, released, into, lake, nicaragua, daily, industry, located, along, the, lake, s, shore, had, been, dumping, effluent, for, an, extended, period, of, time, pennwalt, chemical, corporation, was, found, to, be, the, worst, polluter, nicaragua, s, economic, situation, has, hampered, the, building, of, treatment, facilities, nationwide, see, water, supply, and, sanitation, in, nicaragua, the, country, s, worst, drought, in, 32, years, took, its, toll, on, the, lake, in, 2014, the, nicaraguan, government, recommended, citizens, to, raise, and, eat, iguanas, over, chickens, to, reduce, water, consumption, also, plans, for, the, nicaragua, canal, through, the, lake, could, lead, to, saltwater, and, other, contamination, during, construction, and, operation, of, the, canal
