antarctica, n, t, r, k, t, k, is, earth, s, southernmost, and, least, populated, continent, situated, almost, entirely, south, of, the, antarctic, circle, and, surrounded, by, the, southern, ocean, also, known, as, the, antarctic, ocean, it, contains, the, geographic, south, pole, antarctica, is, the, fifth, largest, continent, being, about, 40, larger, than, europe, and, has, an, area, of, 14, 200, 000, km, 2, 5, 500, 000, sq, mi, most, of, antarctica, is, covered, by, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, with, an, average, thickness, of, 1, 9, km, 1, 2, mi, antarctica, is, on, average, the, coldest, driest, and, windiest, of, the, continents, and, it, has, the, highest, average, elevation, it, is, mainly, a, polar, desert, with, annual, precipitation, of, over, 200, mm, 8, in, along, the, coast, and, far, less, inland, about, 70, of, the, world, s, freshwater, reserves, are, frozen, in, antarctica, which, if, melted, would, raise, global, sea, levels, by, almost, 60, metres, 200, ft, antarctica, holds, the, record, for, the, lowest, measured, temperature, on, earth, 89, 2, c, 128, 6, f, the, coastal, regions, can, reach, temperatures, over, 10, c, 50, f, in, the, summer, native, species, of, animals, include, mites, nematodes, penguins, seals, and, tardigrades, where, vegetation, occurs, it, is, mostly, in, the, form, of, lichen, or, moss, the, ice, shelves, of, antarctica, were, probably, first, seen, in, 1820, during, a, russian, expedition, led, by, fabian, gottlieb, von, bellingshausen, and, mikhail, lazarev, the, decades, that, followed, saw, further, exploration, by, french, american, and, british, expeditions, the, first, confirmed, landing, was, by, a, norwegian, team, in, 1895, in, the, early, 20th, century, there, were, a, few, expeditions, into, the, interior, of, the, continent, british, explorers, robert, falcon, scott, and, ernest, shackleton, were, the, first, to, reach, the, magnetic, south, pole, in, 1909, and, the, geographic, south, pole, was, first, reached, in, 1911, by, norwegian, explorer, roald, amundsen, antarctica, is, governed, by, about, 30, countries, all, of, which, are, parties, of, the, 1959, antarctic, treaty, system, according, to, the, terms, of, the, treaty, military, activity, mining, nuclear, explosions, and, nuclear, waste, disposal, are, all, prohibited, in, antarctica, tourism, fishing, and, research, are, the, main, human, activities, in, and, around, antarctica, during, the, summer, months, about, 5, 000, people, reside, at, research, stations, a, figure, that, drops, to, around, 1, 000, in, the, winter, despite, the, continent, s, remoteness, human, activity, has, a, significant, effect, on, it, via, pollution, ozone, depletion, and, climate, change, the, melting, of, the, potentially, unstable, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, causes, the, most, uncertainty, in, century, scale, projections, of, sea, level, rise, and, the, same, melting, also, affects, the, southern, ocean, overturning, circulation, which, can, eventually, lead, to, significant, impacts, on, the, southern, hemisphere, climate, and, southern, ocean, productivity, the, name, given, to, the, continent, originates, from, the, word, antarctic, which, comes, from, middle, french, antartique, or, antarctique, opposite, to, the, arctic, and, in, turn, the, latin, antarcticus, opposite, to, the, north, antarcticus, is, derived, from, the, greek, anti, and, of, the, bear, northern, the, greek, philosopher, aristotle, wrote, in, meteorology, about, an, antarctic, region, in, c, 350, bce, the, greek, geographer, marinus, of, tyre, reportedly, used, the, name, in, his, world, map, from, the, second, century, ce, now, lost, the, roman, authors, gaius, julius, hyginus, and, apuleius, used, for, the, south, pole, the, romanised, greek, name, polus, antarcticus, from, which, derived, the, old, french, pole, antartike, modern, p, le, antarctique, attested, in, 1270, and, from, there, the, middle, english, pol, antartik, found, first, in, a, treatise, written, by, the, english, author, geoffrey, chaucer, belief, by, europeans, in, the, existence, of, a, terra, australis, a, vast, continent, in, the, far, south, of, the, globe, to, balance, the, northern, lands, of, europe, asia, and, north, africa, had, existed, as, an, intellectual, concept, since, classical, antiquity, the, belief, in, such, a, land, lasted, until, the, european, discovery, of, australia, during, the, early, 19th, century, explorer, matthew, flinders, doubted, the, existence, of, a, detached, continent, south, of, australia, then, called, new, holland, and, thus, advocated, for, the, terra, australis, name, to, be, used, for, australia, instead, in, 1824, the, colonial, authorities, in, sydney, officially, renamed, the, continent, of, new, holland, to, australia, leaving, the, term, terra, australis, unavailable, as, a, reference, to, antarctica, over, the, following, decades, geographers, used, phrases, such, as, the, antarctic, continent, they, searched, for, a, more, poetic, replacement, suggesting, names, such, as, ultima, and, antipodea, antarctica, was, adopted, in, the, 1890s, with, the, first, use, of, the, name, being, attributed, to, the, scottish, cartographer, john, george, bartholomew, antarctica, has, also, been, known, by, the, moniker, great, white, south, after, which, british, photographer, herbert, ponting, named, one, of, his, books, on, antarctic, photography, possibly, as, a, counterpart, to, the, epithet, great, white, north, for, canada, positioned, asymmetrically, around, the, south, pole, and, largely, south, of, the, antarctic, circle, one, of, the, five, major, circles, of, latitude, that, mark, maps, of, the, world, antarctica, is, surrounded, by, the, southern, ocean, rivers, exist, in, antarctica, the, longest, is, the, onyx, antarctica, covers, more, than, 14, 2, million, km, 2, 5, 500, 000, sq, mi, almost, double, the, area, of, australia, making, it, the, fifth, largest, continent, and, comparable, to, the, surface, area, of, pluto, its, coastline, is, almost, 18, 000, km, 11, 200, mi, long, as, of, 1983, of, the, four, coastal, types, 44, of, the, coast, is, floating, ice, in, the, form, of, an, ice, shelf, 38, consists, of, ice, walls, that, rest, on, rock, 13, is, ice, streams, or, the, edge, of, glaciers, and, the, remaining, 5, is, exposed, rock, the, lakes, that, lie, at, the, base, of, the, continental, ice, sheet, occur, mainly, in, the, mcmurdo, dry, valleys, or, various, oases, lake, vostok, discovered, beneath, russia, s, vostok, station, is, the, largest, subglacial, lake, globally, and, one, of, the, largest, lakes, in, the, world, it, was, once, believed, that, the, lake, had, been, sealed, off, for, millions, of, years, but, scientists, now, estimate, its, water, is, replaced, by, the, slow, melting, and, freezing, of, ice, caps, every, 13, 000, years, during, the, summer, the, ice, at, the, edges, of, the, lakes, can, melt, and, liquid, moats, temporarily, form, antarctica, has, both, saline, and, freshwater, lakes, antarctica, is, divided, into, west, antarctica, and, east, antarctica, by, the, transantarctic, mountains, which, stretch, from, victoria, land, to, the, ross, sea, the, vast, majority, of, antarctica, is, covered, by, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, which, averages, 1, 9, km, 1, 2, mi, in, thickness, the, ice, sheet, extends, to, all, but, a, few, oases, which, with, the, exception, of, the, mcmurdo, dry, valleys, are, located, in, coastal, areas, several, antarctic, ice, streams, flow, to, one, of, the, many, antarctic, ice, shelves, a, process, described, by, ice, sheet, dynamics, east, antarctica, comprises, coats, land, queen, maud, land, enderby, land, mac, robertson, land, wilkes, land, and, victoria, land, all, but, a, small, portion, of, the, region, lies, within, the, eastern, hemisphere, east, antarctica, is, largely, covered, by, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, there, are, numerous, islands, surrounding, antarctica, most, of, which, are, volcanic, and, very, young, by, geological, standards, the, most, prominent, exceptions, to, this, are, the, islands, of, the, kerguelen, plateau, the, earliest, of, which, formed, around, 40, ma, vinson, massif, in, the, ellsworth, mountains, is, the, highest, peak, in, antarctica, at, 4, 892, m, 16, 050, ft, mount, erebus, on, ross, island, is, the, world, s, southernmost, active, volcano, and, erupts, around, 10, times, each, day, ash, from, eruptions, has, been, found, 300, kilometres, 190, mi, from, the, volcanic, crater, there, is, evidence, of, a, large, number, of, volcanoes, under, the, ice, which, could, pose, a, risk, to, the, ice, sheet, if, activity, levels, were, to, rise, the, ice, dome, known, as, dome, argus, in, east, antarctica, is, the, highest, antarctic, ice, feature, at, 4, 091, metres, 13, 422, ft, it, is, one, of, the, world, s, coldest, and, driest, places, temperatures, there, may, reach, as, low, as, 90, c, 130, f, and, the, annual, precipitation, is, 1, 3, cm, 0, 39, 1, 18, in, from, the, end, of, the, neoproterozoic, era, to, the, cretaceous, antarctica, was, part, of, the, supercontinent, gondwana, modern, antarctica, was, formed, as, gondwana, gradually, broke, apart, beginning, around, 183, ma, for, a, large, proportion, of, the, phanerozoic, antarctica, had, a, tropical, or, temperate, climate, and, it, was, covered, in, forests, during, the, cambrian, period, gondwana, had, a, mild, climate, west, antarctica, was, partially, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, during, the, time, large, amounts, of, sandstones, limestones, and, shales, were, deposited, east, antarctica, was, at, the, equator, where, seafloor, invertebrates, and, trilobites, flourished, in, the, tropical, seas, by, the, start, of, the, devonian, period, 416, ma, gondwana, was, in, more, southern, latitudes, and, the, climate, was, cooler, though, fossils, of, land, plants, are, known, from, then, sand, and, silts, were, laid, down, in, what, is, now, the, ellsworth, horlick, and, pensacola, mountains, antarctica, became, glaciated, during, the, late, paleozoic, icehouse, beginning, at, the, end, of, the, devonian, period, 360, ma, though, glaciation, would, substantially, increase, during, the, late, carboniferous, it, drifted, closer, to, the, south, pole, and, the, climate, cooled, though, flora, remained, after, deglaciation, during, the, latter, half, of, the, early, permian, the, land, became, dominated, by, glossopterids, an, extinct, group, of, seed, plants, with, no, close, living, relatives, most, prominently, glossopteris, a, tree, interpreted, as, growing, in, waterlogged, soils, which, formed, extensive, coal, deposits, other, plants, found, in, antarctica, during, the, permian, include, cordaitales, sphenopsids, ferns, and, lycophytes, at, the, end, of, the, permian, the, climate, became, drier, and, hotter, over, much, of, gondwana, and, the, glossopterid, forest, ecosystems, collapsed, as, part, of, the, end, permian, mass, extinction, there, is, no, evidence, of, any, tetrapods, having, lived, in, antarctica, during, the, paleozoic, the, continued, warming, dried, out, much, of, gondwana, during, the, triassic, antarctica, was, dominated, by, seed, ferns, pteridosperms, belonging, to, the, genus, dicroidium, which, grew, as, trees, other, associated, triassic, flora, included, ginkgophytes, cycadophytes, conifers, and, sphenopsids, tetrapods, first, appeared, in, antarctica, during, the, early, triassic, with, the, earliest, known, fossils, found, in, the, fremouw, formation, of, the, transantarctic, mountains, synapsids, also, known, as, mammal, like, reptiles, included, species, such, as, lystrosaurus, and, were, common, during, the, early, triassic, the, antarctic, peninsula, began, to, form, during, the, jurassic, period, 206, to, 146, million, years, ago, africa, separated, from, antarctica, in, the, jurassic, around, 160, ma, followed, by, the, indian, subcontinent, in, the, early, cretaceous, about, 125, ma, ginkgo, trees, conifers, bennettitales, horsetails, ferns, and, cycads, were, plentiful, during, the, time, in, west, antarctica, coniferous, forests, dominated, throughout, the, cretaceous, period, 146, 66, ma, though, southern, beech, trees, nothofagus, became, prominent, towards, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, ammonites, were, common, in, the, seas, around, antarctica, and, dinosaurs, were, also, present, though, only, a, few, antarctic, dinosaur, genera, cryolophosaurus, and, glacialisaurus, from, the, early, jurassic, hanson, formation, of, the, transantarctic, mountains, and, antarctopelta, trinisaura, morrosaurus, and, imperobator, from, late, cretaceous, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, have, been, described, during, the, early, paleogene, antarctica, remained, connected, to, south, america, as, well, as, to, southeastern, australia, fauna, from, the, la, meseta, formation, in, the, antarctic, peninsula, dating, to, the, eocene, is, very, similar, to, equivalent, south, american, faunas, with, marsupials, xenarthrans, litoptern, and, astrapotherian, ungulates, as, well, as, gondwanatheres, and, possibly, meridiolestidans, marsupials, are, thought, to, have, dispersed, into, australia, via, antarctica, by, the, early, eocene, around, 53, ma, australia, new, guinea, separated, from, antarctica, opening, the, tasmanian, passage, the, drake, passage, opened, between, antarctica, and, south, america, around, 30, ma, resulting, in, the, creation, of, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, that, completely, isolated, the, continent, models, of, antarctic, geography, suggest, that, this, current, as, well, as, a, feedback, loop, caused, by, lowering, co, 2, levels, caused, the, creation, of, small, yet, permanent, polar, ice, caps, as, co, 2, levels, declined, further, the, ice, began, to, spread, rapidly, replacing, the, forests, that, until, then, had, covered, antarctica, tundra, ecosystems, continued, to, exist, on, antarctica, until, around, 14, 10, million, years, ago, when, further, cooling, lead, to, their, extermination, the, geology, of, antarctica, largely, obscured, by, the, continental, ice, sheet, is, being, revealed, by, techniques, such, as, remote, sensing, ground, penetrating, radar, and, satellite, imagery, geologically, west, antarctica, closely, resembles, the, south, american, andes, the, antarctic, peninsula, was, formed, by, geologic, uplift, and, the, transformation, of, sea, bed, sediments, into, metamorphic, rocks, west, antarctica, was, formed, by, the, merging, of, several, continental, plates, which, created, a, number, of, mountain, ranges, in, the, region, the, most, prominent, being, the, ellsworth, mountains, the, presence, of, the, west, antarctic, rift, system, has, resulted, in, volcanism, along, the, border, between, west, and, east, antarctica, as, well, as, the, creation, of, the, transantarctic, mountains, east, antarctica, is, geologically, varied, its, formation, began, during, the, archean, eon, 4, 000, ma, 2, 500, ma, and, stopped, during, the, cambrian, period, it, is, built, on, a, craton, of, rock, which, is, the, basis, of, the, precambrian, shield, on, top, of, the, base, are, coal, and, sandstones, limestones, and, shales, that, were, laid, down, during, the, devonian, and, jurassic, periods, to, form, the, transantarctic, mountains, in, coastal, areas, such, as, the, shackleton, range, and, victoria, land, some, faulting, has, occurred, coal, was, first, recorded, in, antarctica, near, the, beardmore, glacier, by, frank, wild, on, the, nimrod, expedition, in, 1907, and, low, grade, coal, is, known, to, exist, across, many, parts, of, the, transantarctic, mountains, the, prince, charles, mountains, contain, deposits, of, iron, ore, there, are, oil, and, natural, gas, fields, in, the, ross, sea, antarctica, is, the, coldest, windiest, and, driest, of, earth, s, continents, near, the, coast, the, temperature, can, exceed, 10, c, in, summer, and, fall, to, below, 40, c, in, winter, over, the, elevated, inland, it, can, rise, to, about, 30, c, in, summer, but, fall, below, 80, c, in, winter, the, lowest, natural, air, temperature, ever, recorded, on, earth, was, 89, 2, c, 128, 6, f, at, the, russian, vostok, station, in, antarctica, on, 21, july, 1983, a, lower, air, temperature, of, 94, 7, c, 138, 5, f, was, recorded, in, 2010, by, satellite, however, it, may, have, been, influenced, by, ground, temperatures, and, was, not, recorded, at, a, height, of, 2, m, 7, ft, above, the, surface, as, required, for, official, air, temperature, records, antarctica, is, a, polar, desert, with, little, precipitation, the, continent, receives, an, average, equivalent, to, about, 150, mm, 6, in, of, water, per, year, mostly, in, the, form, of, snow, the, interior, is, dryer, and, receives, less, than, 50, mm, 2, in, per, year, whereas, the, coastal, regions, typically, receive, more, than, 200, mm, 8, in, in, a, few, blue, ice, areas, the, wind, and, sublimation, remove, more, snow, than, is, accumulated, by, precipitation, in, the, dry, valleys, the, same, effect, occurs, over, a, rock, base, leading, to, a, barren, and, desiccated, landscape, antarctica, is, colder, than, the, arctic, region, as, much, of, antarctica, is, over, 3, 000, m, 9, 800, ft, above, sea, level, where, air, temperatures, are, colder, the, relative, warmth, of, the, arctic, ocean, is, transferred, through, the, arctic, sea, ice, and, moderates, temperatures, in, the, arctic, region, east, antarctica, is, colder, than, its, western, counterpart, because, of, its, higher, elevation, weather, fronts, rarely, penetrate, far, into, the, continent, leaving, the, centre, cold, and, dry, with, moderate, wind, speeds, heavy, snowfalls, are, common, on, the, coastal, portion, of, antarctica, where, snowfalls, of, up, to, 1, 22, m, 48, in, in, 48, hours, have, been, recorded, at, the, continent, s, edge, strong, katabatic, winds, off, of, the, polar, plateau, often, blow, at, storm, force, during, the, summer, more, solar, radiation, reaches, the, surface, at, the, south, pole, than, at, the, equator, because, of, the, 24, hours, of, sunlight, received, there, each, day, climate, change, caused, by, greenhouse, gas, emissions, from, human, activities, occurs, everywhere, on, earth, and, while, antarctica, is, less, vulnerable, to, it, than, any, other, continent, climate, change, in, antarctica, has, already, been, observed, there, has, been, an, average, temperature, increase, of, 0, 05, c, decade, since, 1957, across, the, continent, although, it, had, been, uneven, while, west, antarctica, warmed, by, over, 0, 1, c, decade, from, the, 1950s, to, the, 2000s, and, the, exposed, antarctic, peninsula, has, warmed, by, 3, c, 5, 4, f, since, the, mid, 20th, century, the, colder, and, more, stable, east, antarctica, had, been, experiencing, cooling, until, the, 2000s, around, antarctica, the, southern, ocean, has, absorbed, more, heat, than, any, other, ocean, with, particularly, strong, warming, at, depths, below, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, 1230, and, around, the, west, antarctic, which, has, warmed, by, 1, c, 1, 8, f, since, 1955, the, warming, of, antarctica, s, territorial, waters, has, caused, the, weakening, or, outright, collapse, of, ice, shelves, which, float, just, offshore, of, glaciers, and, stabilize, them, many, coastal, glaciers, have, been, losing, mass, and, retreating, which, causes, net, annual, ice, loss, across, antarctica, 1264, even, as, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, continues, to, gain, ice, inland, by, 2100, net, ice, loss, from, antarctica, alone, is, expected, to, add, about, 11, cm, 5, in, to, global, sea, level, rise, however, marine, ice, sheet, instability, may, cause, west, antarctica, to, contribute, tens, of, centimeters, more, if, it, is, triggered, before, 2100, 1270, with, higher, warming, instability, would, be, much, more, likely, and, could, double, overall, 21st, century, sea, level, rise, the, fresh, meltwater, from, the, ice, 1100, 1500, billion, tons, gt, per, year, dilutes, the, saline, antarctic, bottom, water, thus, weakening, the, lower, cell, of, the, southern, ocean, overturning, circulation, 1240, some, research, tentatively, suggests, a, full, collapse, of, the, circulation, may, occur, between, 1, 7, c, 3, 1, f, and, 3, c, 5, 4, f, of, global, warming, although, the, full, effects, are, expected, to, unfold, over, multiple, centuries, they, include, less, precipitation, in, the, southern, hemisphere, but, more, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, an, eventual, decline, of, fisheries, in, the, southern, ocean, with, a, potential, collapse, of, certain, marine, ecosystems, furthermore, while, many, antarctic, species, remain, undiscovered, there, are, already, documented, increases, in, flora, and, large, fauna, such, as, penguins, are, already, seen, struggling, to, retain, suitable, habitat, on, ice, free, land, permafrost, thaws, releasing, not, only, greenhouse, gases, but, also, formerly, frozen, pollution, scientists, have, studied, the, ozone, layer, in, the, atmosphere, above, antarctica, since, the, 1970s, in, 1985, british, scientists, working, on, data, they, had, gathered, at, halley, research, station, on, the, brunt, ice, shelf, discovered, a, large, area, of, low, ozone, concentration, over, antarctica, the, ozone, hole, covers, almost, the, whole, continent, and, was, at, its, largest, in, september, 2006, the, longest, lasting, event, occurred, in, 2020, the, depletion, is, caused, by, the, emission, of, chlorofluorocarbons, and, halons, into, the, atmosphere, which, causes, ozone, to, break, down, into, other, gases, the, extreme, cold, conditions, of, antarctica, allow, polar, stratospheric, clouds, to, form, the, clouds, act, as, catalysts, for, chemical, reactions, which, eventually, lead, to, the, destruction, of, ozone, the, 1987, montreal, protocol, has, restricted, the, emissions, of, ozone, depleting, substances, the, ozone, hole, above, antarctica, is, predicted, to, slowly, disappear, by, the, 2060s, levels, of, ozone, are, expected, to, have, returned, to, values, last, recorded, in, the, 1980s, the, ozone, depletion, can, cause, a, cooling, of, around, 6, c, 11, f, in, the, stratosphere, the, cooling, strengthens, the, polar, vortex, and, so, prevents, the, outflow, of, the, cold, air, near, the, south, pole, which, in, turn, cools, the, continental, mass, of, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, the, peripheral, areas, of, antarctica, especially, the, antarctic, peninsula, are, then, subjected, to, higher, temperatures, which, accelerate, the, melting, of, the, ice, models, suggest, that, ozone, depletion, and, the, enhanced, polar, vortex, effect, may, also, account, for, the, period, of, increasing, sea, ice, extent, lasting, from, when, observation, started, in, the, late, 1970s, until, 2014, since, then, the, coverage, of, antarctic, sea, ice, has, decreased, rapidly, most, species, in, antarctica, seem, to, be, the, descendants, of, species, that, lived, there, millions, of, years, ago, as, such, they, must, have, survived, multiple, glacial, cycles, the, species, survived, the, periods, of, extremely, cold, climate, in, isolated, warmer, areas, such, as, those, with, geothermal, heat, or, areas, that, remained, ice, free, throughout, the, colder, climate, invertebrate, life, of, antarctica, includes, species, of, microscopic, mites, such, as, alaskozetes, antarcticus, lice, nematodes, tardigrades, rotifers, krill, and, springtails, the, few, terrestrial, invertebrates, are, limited, to, the, sub, antarctic, islands, the, flightless, midge, belgica, antarctica, the, largest, purely, terrestrial, animal, in, antarctica, reaches, 6, mm, 1, 4, in, in, size, antarctic, krill, which, congregates, in, large, schools, is, the, keystone, species, of, the, ecosystem, of, the, southern, ocean, being, an, important, food, organism, for, whales, seals, leopard, seals, fur, seals, squid, icefish, and, many, bird, species, such, as, penguins, and, albatrosses, some, species, of, marine, animals, exist, and, rely, directly, or, indirectly, on, phytoplankton, antarctic, sea, life, includes, penguins, blue, whales, orcas, colossal, squids, and, fur, seals, the, antarctic, fur, seal, was, very, heavily, hunted, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, for, its, pelt, by, seal, hunters, from, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, leopard, seals, are, apex, predators, in, the, antarctic, ecosystem, and, migrate, across, the, southern, ocean, in, search, of, food, there, are, approximately, 40, bird, species, that, breed, on, or, close, to, antarctica, including, species, of, petrels, penguins, cormorants, and, gulls, various, other, bird, species, visit, the, ocean, around, antarctica, including, some, that, normally, reside, in, the, arctic, the, emperor, penguin, is, the, only, penguin, that, breeds, during, the, winter, in, antarctica, it, and, the, ad, lie, penguin, breed, farther, south, than, any, other, penguin, a, census, of, marine, life, by, some, 500, researchers, during, the, international, polar, year, was, released, in, 2010, the, research, found, that, more, than, 235, marine, organisms, live, in, both, polar, regions, having, bridged, the, gap, of, 12, 000, km, 7, 456, mi, large, animals, such, as, some, cetaceans, and, birds, make, the, round, trip, annually, smaller, forms, of, life, such, as, sea, cucumbers, and, free, swimming, snails, are, also, found, in, both, polar, oceans, factors, that, may, aid, in, their, distribution, include, temperature, differences, between, the, deep, ocean, at, the, poles, and, the, equator, of, no, more, than, 5, c, 9, f, and, the, major, current, systems, or, marine, conveyor, belts, which, are, able, to, transport, eggs, and, larva, about, 1, 150, species, of, fungi, have, been, recorded, in, the, antarctic, region, of, which, about, 750, are, non, lichen, forming, some, of, the, species, having, evolved, under, extreme, conditions, have, colonised, structural, cavities, within, porous, rocks, and, have, contributed, to, shaping, the, rock, formations, of, the, mcmurdo, dry, valleys, and, surrounding, mountain, ridges, the, simplified, morphology, of, such, fungi, along, with, their, similar, biological, structures, metabolism, systems, capable, of, remaining, active, at, very, low, temperatures, and, reduced, life, cycles, make, them, well, suited, to, such, environments, their, thick, walled, and, strongly, melanised, cells, make, them, resistant, to, uv, radiation, an, antarctic, endemic, species, the, crust, like, lichen, buellia, frigida, has, been, used, as, a, model, organism, in, astrobiology, research, the, same, features, can, be, observed, in, algae, and, cyanobacteria, suggesting, that, they, are, adaptations, to, the, conditions, prevailing, in, antarctica, this, has, led, to, speculation, that, life, on, mars, might, have, been, similar, to, antarctic, fungi, such, as, cryomyces, antarcticus, and, cryomyces, minteri, some, of, the, species, of, fungi, which, are, apparently, endemic, to, antarctica, live, in, bird, dung, and, have, evolved, so, they, can, grow, inside, extremely, cold, dung, but, can, also, pass, through, the, intestines, of, warm, blooded, animals, throughout, its, history, antarctica, has, seen, a, wide, variety, of, plant, life, in, the, cretaceous, it, was, dominated, by, a, fern, conifer, ecosystem, which, changed, into, a, temperate, rainforest, by, the, end, of, that, period, during, the, colder, neogene, 17, 2, 5, ma, a, tundra, ecosystem, replaced, the, rainforests, the, climate, of, present, day, antarctica, does, not, allow, extensive, vegetation, to, form, a, combination, of, freezing, temperatures, poor, soil, quality, and, a, lack, of, moisture, and, sunlight, inhibit, plant, growth, causing, low, species, diversity, and, limited, distribution, the, flora, largely, consists, of, bryophytes, 25, species, of, liverworts, and, 100, species, of, mosses, there, are, three, species, of, flowering, plants, all, of, which, are, found, in, the, antarctic, peninsula, deschampsia, antarctica, antarctic, hair, grass, colobanthus, quitensis, antarctic, pearlwort, and, the, non, native, poa, annua, annual, bluegrass, of, the, 700, species, of, algae, in, antarctica, around, half, are, marine, phytoplankton, multicoloured, snow, algae, are, especially, abundant, in, the, coastal, regions, during, the, summer, even, sea, ice, can, harbour, unique, ecological, communities, as, it, expels, all, salt, from, the, water, when, it, freezes, which, accumulates, into, pockets, of, brine, that, also, harbour, dormant, microorganisms, when, the, ice, begins, to, melt, brine, pockets, expand, and, can, combine, to, form, brine, channels, and, the, algae, inside, the, pockets, can, reawaken, and, thrive, until, the, next, freeze, bacteria, have, also, been, found, as, deep, as, 800, m, 0, 50, mi, under, the, ice, it, is, thought, to, be, likely, that, there, exists, a, native, bacterial, community, within, the, subterranean, water, body, of, lake, vostok, the, existence, of, life, there, is, thought, to, strengthen, the, argument, for, the, possibility, of, life, on, jupiter, s, moon, europa, which, may, have, water, beneath, its, water, ice, crust, there, exists, a, community, of, extremophile, bacteria, in, the, highly, alkaline, waters, of, lake, untersee, the, prevalence, of, highly, resilient, creatures, in, such, inhospitable, areas, could, further, bolster, the, argument, for, extraterrestrial, life, in, cold, methane, rich, environments, the, first, international, agreement, to, protect, antarctica, s, biodiversity, was, adopted, in, 1964, the, overfishing, of, krill, an, animal, that, plays, a, large, role, in, the, antarctic, ecosystem, led, officials, to, enact, regulations, on, fishing, the, convention, for, the, conservation, of, antarctic, marine, living, resources, an, international, treaty, that, came, into, force, in, 1980, regulates, fisheries, aiming, to, preserve, ecological, relationships, despite, these, regulations, illegal, fishing, particularly, of, the, highly, prized, patagonian, toothfish, which, is, marketed, as, chilean, sea, bass, in, the, u, s, remains, a, problem, in, analogy, to, the, 1980, treaty, on, sustainable, fishing, countries, led, by, new, zealand, and, the, united, states, negotiated, a, treaty, on, mining, this, convention, on, the, regulation, of, antarctic, mineral, resource, activities, was, adopted, in, 1988, after, a, strong, campaign, from, environmental, organisations, first, australia, and, then, france, decided, not, to, ratify, the, treaty, instead, countries, adopted, the, protocol, on, environmental, protection, to, the, antarctic, treaty, the, madrid, protocol, which, entered, into, force, in, 1998, the, madrid, protocol, bans, all, mining, designating, the, continent, as, a, natural, reserve, devoted, to, peace, and, science, the, pressure, group, greenpeace, established, a, base, on, ross, island, from, 1987, to, 1992, as, part, of, its, attempt, to, establish, the, continent, as, a, world, park, the, southern, ocean, whale, sanctuary, was, established, in, 1994, by, the, international, whaling, commission, it, covers, 50, million, km, 2, 19, million, sq, mi, and, completely, surrounds, the, antarctic, continent, all, commercial, whaling, is, banned, in, the, zone, though, japan, has, continued, to, hunt, whales, in, the, area, ostensibly, for, research, purposes, despite, these, protections, the, biodiversity, in, antarctica, is, still, at, risk, from, human, activities, specially, protected, areas, cover, less, than, 2, of, the, area, and, provide, better, protection, for, animals, with, popular, appeal, than, for, less, visible, animals, there, are, more, terrestrial, protected, areas, than, marine, protected, areas, ecosystems, are, impacted, by, local, and, global, threats, notably, pollution, the, invasion, of, non, native, species, and, the, various, effects, of, climate, change, early, world, maps, like, the, 1513, piri, reis, map, feature, the, hypothetical, continent, terra, australis, much, larger, than, and, unrelated, to, antarctica, terra, australis, was, a, landmass, that, classical, scholars, presumed, necessary, to, balance, the, known, lands, in, the, northern, hemisphere, captain, james, cook, s, ships, hms, resolution, and, adventure, crossed, the, antarctic, circle, on, 17, january, 1773, in, december, 1773, and, again, in, january, 1774, cook, came, within, about, 120, km, 75, mi, of, the, antarctic, coast, before, retreating, in, the, face, of, field, ice, in, january, 1773, in, 1775, he, called, the, existence, of, a, polar, continent, probable, and, in, another, copy, of, his, journal, he, wrote, firmly, believe, it, and, it, s, more, than, probable, that, we, have, seen, a, part, of, it, sealers, were, among, the, earliest, to, go, closer, to, the, antarctic, landmass, perhaps, in, the, earlier, part, of, the, 19th, century, the, oldest, known, human, remains, in, the, antarctic, region, was, a, skull, dated, from, 1819, to, 1825, that, belonged, to, a, young, woman, on, yamana, beach, at, the, south, shetland, islands, the, woman, who, was, likely, to, have, been, part, of, a, sealing, expedition, was, found, in, 1985, the, first, person, to, see, antarctica, or, its, ice, shelf, was, long, thought, to, have, been, the, british, sailor, edward, bransfield, a, captain, in, the, royal, navy, who, discovered, the, tip, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, on, 30, january, 1820, however, a, captain, in, the, imperial, russian, navy, fabian, gottlieb, von, bellingshausen, recorded, seeing, an, ice, shelf, on, 27, january, the, american, sealer, nathaniel, palmer, whose, sealing, ship, was, in, the, region, at, this, time, may, also, have, been, the, first, to, sight, the, antarctic, peninsula, the, first, russian, antarctic, expedition, led, by, bellingshausen, and, mikhail, lazarev, on, the, 985, ton, sloop, of, war, vostok, and, the, 530, ton, support, vessel, mirny, reached, a, point, within, 32, km, 20, mi, of, queen, maud, land, and, recorded, sighting, an, ice, shelf, at, 69, 21, 28, s, 2, 14, 50, w, 69, 35778, s, 2, 24722, w, 69, 35778, 2, 24722, on, 27, january, 1820, the, sighting, happened, three, days, before, bransfield, sighted, the, land, of, the, trinity, peninsula, of, antarctica, as, opposed, to, the, ice, of, an, ice, shelf, and, 10, months, before, palmer, did, so, in, november, 1820, the, first, documented, landing, on, antarctica, was, by, the, english, born, american, sealer, john, davis, apparently, at, hughes, bay, on, 7, february, 1821, although, some, historians, dispute, this, claim, as, there, is, no, evidence, davis, landed, on, the, antarctic, continent, rather, than, an, offshore, island, on, 22, january, 1840, two, days, after, the, discovery, of, the, coast, west, of, the, balleny, islands, some, members, of, the, crew, of, the, 1837, 1840, expedition, of, the, french, explorer, jules, dumont, d, urville, disembarked, on, the, dumoulin, islands, off, the, coast, of, ad, lie, land, where, they, took, some, mineral, algae, and, animal, samples, erected, the, french, flag, and, claimed, french, sovereignty, over, the, territory, the, american, captain, charles, wilkes, led, an, expedition, in, 1838, 1839, and, was, the, first, to, claim, he, had, discovered, the, continent, the, british, naval, officer, james, clark, ross, failed, to, realise, that, what, he, referred, to, as, the, various, patches, of, land, recently, discovered, by, the, american, french, and, english, navigators, on, the, verge, of, the, antarctic, circle, were, connected, to, form, a, single, continent, the, american, explorer, mercator, cooper, landed, on, east, antarctica, on, 26, january, 1853, the, first, confirmed, landing, on, the, continental, mass, of, antarctica, occurred, in, 1895, when, the, norwegian, swedish, whaling, ship, antarctic, reached, cape, adare, during, the, nimrod, expedition, led, by, the, british, explorer, ernest, shackleton, in, 1907, parties, led, by, edgeworth, david, became, the, first, to, climb, mount, erebus, and, to, reach, the, south, magnetic, pole, douglas, mawson, who, assumed, the, leadership, of, the, magnetic, pole, party, on, their, perilous, return, retired, in, 1931, between, december, 1908, and, february, 1909, shackleton, and, three, members, of, his, expedition, became, the, first, humans, to, traverse, the, ross, ice, shelf, the, first, to, cross, the, transantarctic, mountains, via, the, beardmore, glacier, and, the, first, to, set, foot, on, the, south, polar, plateau, on, 14, december, 1911, an, expedition, led, by, norwegian, explorer, roald, amundsen, from, the, ship, fram, became, the, first, to, reach, the, geographic, south, pole, using, a, route, from, the, bay, of, whales, and, up, the, axel, heiberg, glacier, one, month, later, the, doomed, terra, nova, expedition, reached, the, pole, the, american, explorer, richard, e, byrd, led, four, expeditions, to, antarctica, during, the, 1920s, 1930s, and, 1940s, using, the, first, mechanised, tractors, his, expeditions, conducted, extensive, geographical, and, scientific, research, and, he, is, credited, with, surveying, a, larger, region, of, the, continent, than, any, other, explorer, in, 1937, ingrid, christensen, became, the, first, woman, to, step, onto, the, antarctic, mainland, caroline, mikkelsen, had, landed, on, an, island, of, antarctica, earlier, in, 1935, the, south, pole, was, next, reached, on, 31, october, 1956, when, a, u, s, navy, group, led, by, rear, admiral, george, j, dufek, successfully, landed, an, aircraft, there, six, women, were, flown, to, the, south, pole, as, a, publicity, stunt, in, 1969, in, the, summer, of, 1996, 1997, norwegian, explorer, b, rge, ousland, became, the, first, person, to, cross, antarctica, alone, from, coast, to, coast, helped, by, a, kite, on, parts, of, the, journey, ousland, holds, the, record, for, the, fastest, unsupported, journey, to, the, south, pole, taking, 34, days, the, first, semi, permanent, inhabitants, of, regions, near, antarctica, areas, situated, south, of, the, antarctic, convergence, were, british, and, american, sealers, who, used, to, spend, a, year, or, more, on, south, georgia, from, 1786, onward, during, the, whaling, era, which, lasted, until, 1966, the, population, of, the, island, varied, from, over, 1, 000, in, the, summer, over, 2, 000, in, some, years, to, some, 200, in, the, winter, most, of, the, whalers, were, norwegian, with, an, increasing, proportion, from, britain, antarctica, s, population, consists, mostly, of, the, staff, of, research, stations, in, antarctica, which, are, continuously, maintained, despite, the, population, decline, in, the, winter, although, there, are, 2, all, civilian, bases, in, antarctica, the, esperanza, base, and, the, villa, las, estrellas, base, the, number, of, people, conducting, and, supporting, scientific, research, and, other, work, on, the, continent, and, its, nearby, islands, varies, from, about, 1, 200, in, winter, to, about, 4, 800, in, the, summer, with, an, additional, 136, people, in, the, winter, to, 266, people, in, the, summer, from, the, 2, civilian, bases, as, of, 2017, some, of, the, research, stations, are, staffed, year, round, the, winter, over, personnel, typically, arriving, from, their, home, countries, for, a, one, year, assignment, the, russian, orthodox, holy, trinity, church, at, the, bellingshausen, station, on, king, george, island, opened, in, 2004, it, is, staffed, year,

based, on, consensus, instead, of, a, vote, the, treaty, set, aside, antarctica, as, a, scientific, preserve, and, established, freedom, of, scientific, investigation, and, environmental, protection, in, 1539, the, king, of, spain, charles, v, created, the, governorate, of, terra, australis, which, encompassed, lands, south, of, the, strait, of, magellan, and, thus, theoretically, antarctica, the, existence, of, which, was, only, hypothesized, at, the, time, granting, this, governorate, to, pedro, sancho, de, la, hoz, who, in, 1540, transferred, the, title, to, the, conquistador, pedro, de, valdivia, spain, claimed, all, the, territories, to, the, south, of, the, strait, of, magellan, until, the, south, pole, with, eastern, and, western, borders, to, these, claims, specified, in, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, and, zaragoza, respectively, in, 1555, the, claim, was, incorporated, to, chile, in, the, present, sovereignty, over, regions, of, antarctica, is, claimed, by, seven, countries, while, a, few, of, these, countries, have, mutually, recognised, each, other, s, claims, the, validity, of, the, claims, is, not, recognised, universally, new, claims, on, antarctica, have, been, suspended, since, 1959, although, in, 2015, norway, formally, defined, queen, maud, land, as, including, the, unclaimed, area, between, it, and, the, south, pole, the, argentine, british, and, chilean, claims, overlap, and, have, caused, friction, in, 2012, after, the, british, foreign, commonwealth, office, designated, a, previously, unnamed, area, queen, elizabeth, land, in, tribute, to, queen, elizabeth, ii, s, diamond, jubilee, the, argentine, government, protested, against, the, claim, the, uk, passed, some, of, the, areas, it, claimed, to, australia, and, new, zealand, after,

after, the, start, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, some, nature, conservation, groups, have, expressed, concern, over, the, potential, adverse, effects, caused, by, the, influx, of, visitors, and, have, called, for, limits, on, the, size, of, visiting, cruise, ships, and, a, tourism, quota, the, primary, response, by, antarctic, treaty, parties, has, been, to, develop, guidelines, that, set, landing, limits, and, closed, or, restricted, zones, on, the, more, frequently, visited, sites, tourism, in, antarctica, is, in, part, ecologically, focused, with, expeditions, being, offered, for, bird,
