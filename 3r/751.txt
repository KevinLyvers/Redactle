a, city, block, residential, block, urban, block, or, simply, block, is, a, central, element, of, urban, planning, and, urban, design, in, a, city, with, a, grid, system, the, block, is, the, smallest, group, of, buildings, that, is, surrounded, by, streets, city, blocks, are, the, space, for, buildings, within, the, street, pattern, of, a, city, and, form, the, basic, unit, of, a, city, s, urban, fabric, city, blocks, may, be, subdivided, into, any, number, of, smaller, land, lots, usually, in, private, ownership, though, in, some, cases, it, may, be, other, forms, of, tenure, city, blocks, are, usually, built, up, to, varying, degrees, and, thus, form, the, physical, containers, or, streetwalls, of, public, space, most, cities, are, composed, of, a, greater, or, lesser, variety, of, sizes, and, shapes, of, urban, block, for, example, many, pre, industrial, cores, of, cities, in, europe, asia, and, the, middle, east, tend, to, have, irregularly, shaped, street, patterns, and, urban, blocks, while, cities, based, on, grids, have, much, more, regular, arrangements, by, extension, the, word, block, is, an, important, informal, unit, of, length, equal, to, the, distance, between, two, streets, of, a, street, grid, in, most, cities, of, the, new, world, that, were, planned, rather, than, developing, gradually, over, a, long, period, of, time, streets, are, typically, laid, out, on, a, grid, plan, of, square, or, rectangular, city, blocks, using, the, perimeter, block, development, principle, city, blocks, are, developed, so, that, buildings, are, located, along, the, perimeter, of, the, block, with, entrances, facing, the, street, and, semi, private, courtyards, in, the, rear, of, the, buildings, this, historic, arrangement, reflects, organic, development, of, structures, and, land, usage, adapted, to, urban, planning, since, the, spacing, of, streets, in, grid, plans, varies, so, widely, among, cities, or, even, within, cities, it, is, difficult, to, generalize, about, the, size, of, a, city, block, oblong, blocks, range, considerably, in, width, and, length, the, standard, block, in, manhattan, is, about, 264, by, 900, feet, 80, m, 274, m, in, chicago, a, typical, city, block, is, 330, by, 660, feet, 100, m, 200, m, meaning, that, 16, east, west, blocks, or, 8, north, south, blocks, measure, one, mile, which, has, been, adopted, by, other, us, cities, in, much, of, the, united, states, and, canada, the, addresses, follow, a, block, and, lot, number, system, in, which, each, block, of, a, street, is, allotted, 100, building, numbers, the, blocks, in, central, melbourne, australia, are, also, 330, by, 660, feet, 100, m, 200, m, formed, by, splitting, the, square, blocks, in, an, original, grid, with, a, narrow, street, down, the, middle, many, old, world, cities, have, grown, by, accretion, over, time, rather, than, being, planned, making, rectangular, city, blocks, uncommon, in, the, innermost, development, among, most, european, cities, for, example, an, exception, is, represented, by, those, cities, that, were, founded, as, roman, military, settlements, and, that, often, preserve, the, original, grid, layout, around, two, main, orthogonal, axes, such, as, turin, italy, and, cities, heavily, damaged, during, world, war, ii, like, frankfurt, following, the, example, of, philadelphia, new, york, city, adopted, the, commissioners, plan, of, 1811, for, a, more, extensive, grid, plan, some, variations, of, the, interpretation, of, city, blocks, include, superblocks, subblocks, and, perimeter, blocks, a, superblock, or, super, block, is, an, area, of, urban, land, that, is, bounded, by, arterial, roads, and, the, size, of, multiple, typically, sized, city, blocks, within, the, superblock, the, local, road, network, if, any, is, designed, to, serve, only, local, needs, superblocks, can, also, contain, an, orthogonal, internal, road, network, including, those, based, on, a, grid, plan, or, quasi, grid, plan, that, typology, is, prevalent, in, japan, and, china, for, example, chen, defines, the, supergrid, and, superblock, urban, morphology, in, that, context, as, follows, the, supergrid, is, a, large, scale, net, of, wide, roads, that, defines, a, series, of, cells, or, superblocks, each, containing, a, network, of, narrower, streets, superblocks, can, also, be, retroactively, superimposed, on, pre, existing, grid, plan, by, changing, the, traffic, rules, and, streetscape, of, internal, streets, within, the, superblock, as, in, the, case, of, barcelona, s, superilles, catalan, for, superblocks, each, superilla, has, nine, city, blocks, with, speed, limits, on, the, internal, roads, slowed, to, 10, 20, km, h, 6, 2, 12, 4, mph, through, traffic, disallowed, and, through, travel, possible, only, on, the, perimeter, roads, in, a, geoprocessing, perspective, there, are, two, complementary, ways, of, modeling, city, blocks, a, block, without, sidewalks, is, always, within, a, block, with, sidewalks, the, geometric, subtraction, of, a, block, without, sidewalks, from, block, with, sidewalks, contains, the, sidewalk, the, alley, and, any, other, non, lot, sub, structure, a, perimeter, block, is, a, type, of, city, block, which, is, built, up, on, all, sides, surrounding, a, central, space, that, is, semi, private, they, may, contain, a, mixture, of, uses, with, commercial, or, retail, functions, on, the, ground, floor, perimeter, blocks, are, a, key, component, of, many, european, cities, and, are, an, urban, form, that, allows, very, high, urban, densities, to, be, achieved, without, high, rise, buildings, in, north, american, english, and, australian, english, the, word, block, is, used, as, an, informal, unit, of, distance, for, example, someone, giving, directions, might, say, it, s, three, blocks, from, here, meaning, either, literally, three, blocks, distant, in, a, city, grid, or, the, equivalent, of, three, blocks, without, a, grid, since, there, is, no, standard, dimension, for, city, blocks, and, they, are, typically, rectangular, in, shape, meaning, a, block, and, one, direction, is, a, different, length, than, a, block, in, another, colloquial, directions, involving, blocks, as, proxies, for, measurements, in, feet, or, meters, are, obviously, both, imprecise, and, relative
