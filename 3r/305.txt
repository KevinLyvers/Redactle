into, the, pacific, ocean, the, southern, rivers, into, the, arafura, sea, and, the, gulf, of, papua, on, the, north, side, the, largest, rivers, are, the, mamberamo, sepik, and, ramu, mamberamo, was, born, from, the, confluence, of, two, large, inland, rivers, tariku, comes, from, the, west, to, the, east, and, taritatu, from, the, east, these, rivers, meander, through, swamps, with, huge, internal, descents, and, then, merge, the, mamberamo, thus, formed, reaches, the, ocean, by, breaking, through, the, coastal, mountains, mamberamo, river, is, navigable, to, marine, falls, the, sepik, is, a, much, more, important, river, similarly, it, collects, water, from, a, spacious, pool, it, is, 1, 100, kilometers, from, the, victor, emanuel, range, to, the, estuary, making, it, the, longest, river, in, new, guinea, the, winding, muddy, sluggish, river, can, be, navigated, for, 500, km, ramu, is, a, 650, km, long, river, its, lower, section, is, navigable, but, its, upper, flow, is, high, falling, fast, flowing, the, energy, of, the, river, is, used, by, a, power, plant, near, the, city, of, kainantu, on, the, south, side, the, most, significant, rivers, are, pulau, digul, fly, kikori, and, purari, the, largest, river, in, the, western, part, of, the, island, is, digul, it, originates, from, the, star, mountains, which, rise, to, an, altitude, of, 4, 700, m, the, coastal, plain, is, bordered, by, a, swamp, world, hundreds, of, kilometers, wide, digul, is, the, main, transport, route, to, the, fertile, hills, and, mountains, within, the, island, the, river, fly, is, born, near, the, eastern, branches, of, the, digul, it, is, named, after, one, of, the, ships, of, the, english, royal, fleet, which, first, sailed, into, the, mouth, of, the, river, in, 1845, the, total, length, of, the, river, is, 1, 050, km, smaller, boats, can, sail, 900, km, on, the, river, the, estuary, section, which, decomposes, into, islands, is, 70, km, wide, the, tide, of, the, sea, can, have, an,

guinea, the, many, rivers, flowing, into, the, gulf, of, papua, form, a, single, delta, complex, the, rivers, of, the, island, are, extremely, rich, in, water, due, to, the, annual, rainfall, of, 2, 000, 10, 000, mm, according, to, a, modest, calculation, the, new, guinea, river, carries, about, 1, 500, km, 3, a, 48, 000, m, 3, s, of, water, into, the, sea, fly, alone, carries, more, water, 238,

as, part, of, a, greater, indo, australian, archipelago, geologically, it, is, a, part, of, the, same, tectonic, plate, as, australia, when, world, sea, levels, were, low, the, two, shared, shorelines, which, now, lie, 100, to, 140, metres, below, sea, level, and, combined, with, lands, now, inundated, into, the, tectonic, continent, of, sahul, also, known, as, greater, australia, the, two, landmasses, became, separated, when, the, area, now, known, as, the, torres, strait, flooded, after, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, anthropologically, new, guinea, is, considered, part, of, melanesia, new, guinea, is, differentiated, from, its, drier, flatter, and, less, fertile, southern, counterpart, australia, by, its, much, higher, rainfall, and, its, active, volcanic, geology, yet, the, two, land, masses, share, a, similar, animal, fauna, with, marsupials, including, wallabies, and, possums, and, the, egg, laying, monotreme, the, echidna, other, than, bats, and, some, two, dozen, indigenous, rodent, genera, there, are, no, pre, human, indigenous, placental, mammals, pigs, several, additional, species, of, rats, and, the, ancestor, of, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, were, introduced, with, human, colonization, prior, to, the, 1970s, archaeologists, called, the, single, pleistocene, landmass, by, the, name, australasia, although, this, word, is, most, often, used, for, a, wider, region, that, includes, lands, such, as, new, zealand, which, are, not, on, the, same, continental, shelf, in, the, early, 1970s, they, introduced, the, term, greater, australia, for, the, pleistocene, continent, then, at, a, 1975, conference, and, consequent, publication, they, extended, the, name, sahul, from, its, previous, use, for, just, the, sahul, shelf, to, cover, the, continent, the, island, of, new, guinea, is, divided, politically, into, roughly, equal, halves, across, a, north, south, line, the, current, population, of, the, island, of, new, guinea, is, about, fifteen, million, archaeological, evidence, indicates, that, humans, may, have, inhabited, the, island, continuously, since, 50, 000, bce, and, first, settlement, possibly, dating, back, to, 60, 000, years, ago, has, been, proposed, the, island, is, presently, populated, by, almost, a, thousand, different, tribal, groups, and, a, near, equivalent, number, of, separate, languages, which, makes, new, guinea, the, most, linguistically, diverse, area, in, the, world, ethnologue, s, 14th, edition, lists, 826, languages, of, papua, new, guinea, and, 257, languages, of, western, new, guinea, total, 1073, languages, with, 12, languages, overlapping, they, can, be, divided, into, two, groups, the, austronesian, languages, and, all, the, others, placed, in, the, catch, all, category, of, papuan, languages, most, of, which, are, unrelated, the, separation, is, not, merely, linguistic, warfare, among, societies, was, a, factor, in, the, evolution, of, the, men, s, house, separate, housing, for, groups, of, adult, men, away, from, the, single, family, houses, of, women, and, children, pig, based, trade, between, groups, and, pig, based, feasts, form, a, common, tradition, with, the, other, peoples, of, southeast, asia, and, oceania, most, papuan, societies, practice, agriculture, supplemented, by, hunting, and, gathering, current, evidence, indicates, that, the, papuans, who, constitute, the, majority, of, the, island, s, peoples, are, descended, from, the, earliest, human, inhabitants, of, new, guinea, these, original, inhabitants, first, arrived, in, new, guinea, at, a, time, around, the, last, glacial, maximum, c, 21, 000, years, ago, when, the, island, was, connected, to, the, australian, continent, via, a, land, bridge, forming, the, landmass, of, sahul, these, peoples, had, made, the, shortened, sea, crossing, from, the, islands, of, wallacea, and, sundaland, the, present, malay, archipelago, by, at, least, 40, 000, years, ago, the, ancestral, austronesian, peoples, are, believed, to, have, arrived, considerably, later, approximately, 3, 500, years, ago, as, part, of, a, gradual, seafaring, migration, from, southeast, asia, possibly, originating, in, taiwan, austronesian, speaking, peoples, colonized, many, of, the, offshore, islands, to, the, north, and, east, of, new, guinea, such, as, new, ireland, and, new, britain, with, settlements, also, on, the, coastal, fringes, of, the, main, island, in, places, human, habitation, of, new, guinea, over, tens, of, thousands, of, years, has, led, to, a, great, deal, of, diversity, which, was, further, increased, by, the, later, arrival, of, the, austronesians, and, the, more, recent, history, of, european, and, asian, settlement, through, events, like, transmigration, large, areas, of, new, guinea, are, yet, to, be, explored, by, scientists, and, anthropologists, the, indonesian, province, of, west, papua, is, home, to, an, estimated, 44, uncontacted, tribal, groups, with, some, 786, 000, km, 2, of, tropical, land, less, than, one, half, of, one, percent, 0, 5, of, the, earth, s, surface, new, guinea, has, an, immense, biodiversity, containing, between, 5, and, 10, percent, of, the, total, species, on, the, planet, this, percentage, is, about, the, same, amount, as, that, found, in, the, united, states, or, australia, a, high, percentage, of, new, guinea, s, species, are, endemic, and, thousands, are, still, unknown, to, science, probably, well, over, 200, 000, species, of, insect, between, 11, 000, and, 20, 000, plant, species, and, over, 650, resident, bird, species, most, of, these, species, are, shared, at, least, in, their, origin, with, the, continent, of, australia, which, was, until, fairly, recent, geological, times, part, of, the, same, landmass, see, australia, new, guinea, for, an, overview, the, island, is, so, large, that, it, is, considered, nearly, a, continent, in, terms, of, its, biological, distinctiveness, in, the, period, from, 1998, to, 2008, conservationists, identified, 1, 060, new, species, in, new, guinea, including, 218, plants, 43, reptiles, 12, mammals, 580, invertebrates, 134, amphibians, 2, birds, and, 71, fish, between, 2011, and, 2017, researchers, described, 465, previously, undocumented, plant, species, in, new, guinea, as, of, 2019, the,

guinea, the, first, inhabitants, indigenous, people, of, new, guinea, from, whom, the, papuan, people, are, probably, descended, adapted, to, the, range, of, ecologies, and, in, time, developed, one, of, the, earliest, known, agricultures, remains, of, this, agricultural, system, in, the, form, of, ancient, irrigation, systems, in, the, highlands, of, papua, new, guinea, are, being, studied, by, archaeologists, research, indicates, that, the, highlands, were, an, early, and, independent, center, of, agriculture, with, evidence, of, irrigation, going, back, at, least, 10, 000, years, sugarcane, was, cultivated, in, new, guinea, around, 6000, bce, the, gardens, of, the, new, guinea, highlands, are, ancient, intensive, permacultures, adapted, to, high, population, densities, very,

successful, than, most, scientific, farmers, in, raising, certain, crops, there, is, evidence, that, new, guinea, gardeners, invented, crop, rotation, well, before, western, europeans, a, unique, feature, of, new, guinea, permaculture, is, the, silviculture, of, casuarina, oligodon, a, tall, sturdy, native, ironwood, tree, suited, to, use, for, timber, and, fuel, with, root, nodules, that, fix, nitrogen, pollen, studies, show, that, it, was, adopted, during, an, ancient, period, of, extreme, deforestation, in, more, recent, millennia, another, wave, of, people, arrived, on, the, shores, of, new, guinea, these, were, the, austronesian, people, who, had, spread, down, from, taiwan, through, the, south, east, asian, archipelago, colonising, many, of, the, islands, on, the, way, the, austronesian, people, had, technology, and, skills, extremely, well, adapted, to, ocean, voyaging, and, austronesian, language, speaking, people, are, present, along, much, of, the, coastal, areas, and, islands, of, new, guinea, they, also, introduced, pigs, and, dogs, these, austronesian, migrants, are, considered, the, ancestors, of, most, people, in, insular, southeast, asia, from, sumatra, and, java, to, borneo, and, sulawesi, as, well, as, coastal, new, guinea, the, western, part, of, the, island, was, in, contact, with, kingdoms, in, other, parts, of, modern, day, indonesia, the,
