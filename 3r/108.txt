lake, superior, is, the, largest, freshwater, lake, in, the, world, by, surface, area, and, the, third, largest, freshwater, lake, by, volume, holding, 10, of, the, world, s, surface, fresh, water, located, in, central, north, america, it, is, the, northernmost, and, westernmost, of, the, great, lakes, of, north, america, straddling, the, canada, united, states, border, with, the, canadian, province, of, ontario, to, the, north, and, east, and, the, u, s, states, of, minnesota, to, the, west, and, michigan, and, wisconsin, to, the, south, it, drains, into, lake, huron, via, st, marys, river, then, through, the, lower, great, lakes, to, the, st, lawrence, river, and, ultimately, the, atlantic, ocean, the, ojibwe, name, for, the, lake, is, gichi, gami, in, syllabics, pronounced, gitchi, gami, or, kitchi, gami, in, different, dialects, meaning, great, sea, henry, wadsworth, longfellow, wrote, this, name, as, gitche, gumee, in, the, poem, the, song, of, hiawatha, as, did, gordon, lightfoot, in, his, song, the, wreck, of, the, edmund, fitzgerald, according, to, other, sources, the, full, ojibwe, name, is, ojibwe, gichigami, ojibwe, s, great, sea, or, anishinaabe, gichigami, anishinaabe, s, great, sea, the, 1878, dictionary, by, father, frederic, baraga, the, first, one, written, for, the, ojibway, language, gives, the, ojibwe, name, as, otchipwe, kitchi, gami, a, transliteration, of, ojibwe, gichigami, in, the, 17th, century, the, first, french, explorers, approached, the, great, inland, sea, by, way, of, the, ottawa, river, and, lake, huron, they, referred, to, their, discovery, as, le, lac, sup, rieur, the, upper, lake, i, e, above, lake, huron, some, 17th, century, jesuit, missionaries, referred, to, it, as, lac, tracy, for, alexandre, de, prouville, de, tracy, after, taking, control, of, the, region, from, the, french, in, the, 1760s, following, their, defeat, in, the, french, and, indian, war, the, british, anglicized, the, lake, s, name, to, superior, on, account, of, its, being, superior, in, magnitude, to, any, of, the, lakes, on, that, vast, continent, lake, superior, empties, into, lake, huron, via, the, st, marys, river, and, the, soo, locks, sault, ste, marie, locks, lake, superior, is, the, largest, freshwater, lake, in, the, world, by, area, and, the, third, largest, in, volume, behind, lake, baikal, in, siberia, and, lake, tanganyika, in, east, africa, the, caspian, sea, while, larger, than, lake, superior, in, both, surface, area, and, volume, is, brackish, lake, superior, has, a, surface, area, of, 31, 700, square, miles, 82, 103, km, 2, which, is, approximately, the, size, of, south, carolina, or, austria, it, has, a, maximum, length, of, 350, statute, miles, 560, km, 300, nmi, and, maximum, breadth, of, 160, statute, miles, 257, km, 139, nmi, its, average, depth, is, 80, 5, fathoms, 483, ft, 147, m, with, a, maximum, depth, of, 222, 17, fathoms, 1, 333, ft, 406, m, lake, superior, contains, 2, 900, cubic, miles, 12, 100, km, 3, of, water, there, is, enough, water, in, lake, superior, to, cover, the, entire, land, mass, of, north, and, south, america, to, a, depth, of, 30, centimetres, 12, in, the, shoreline, of, the, lake, stretches, 2, 726, miles, 4, 387, km, including, islands, the, lake, boasts, a, very, small, ratio, 1, 55, of, catchment, area, to, surface, area, which, indicates, minimal, terrestrial, influence, american, limnologist, j, val, klump, was, the, first, person, to, reach, the, lowest, depth, of, lake, superior, on, july, 30, 1985, as, part, of, a, scientific, expedition, which, at, 122, fathoms, 1, foot, 733, ft, or, 223, m, below, sea, level, is, the, second, lowest, spot, in, the, continental, interior, of, the, united, states, and, the, third, lowest, spot, in, the, interior, of, the, north, american, continent, after, great, slave, lake, in, the, northwest, territories, of, canada, 1, 503, ft, or, 458, m, below, sea, level, and, iliamna, lake, in, alaska, 942, ft, or, 287, m, though, crater, lake, is, the, deepest, lake, in, the, united, states, and, deeper, than, lake, superior, crater, lake, s, elevation, is, higher, and, consequently, its, deepest, point, is, 4, 229, feet, 1, 289, m, above, sea, level, while, the, temperature, of, the, surface, of, lake, superior, varies, seasonally, the, temperature, below, 110, fathoms, 660, ft, 200, m, is, an, almost, constant, 39, f, 4, c, this, variation, in, temperature, makes, the, lake, seasonally, stratified, twice, per, year, however, the, water, column, reaches, a, uniform, temperature, of, 39, f, 4, c, from, top, to, bottom, and, the, lake, waters, thoroughly, mix, this, feature, makes, the, lake, dimictic, because, of, its, volume, lake, superior, has, a, retention, time, of, 191, years, annual, storms, on, lake, superior, regularly, feature, wave, heights, of, over, 20, feet, 6, m, waves, well, over, 30, feet, 9, m, have, been, recorded, lake, superior, is, fed, by, more, than, 200, rivers, including, the, nipigon, river, the, st, louis, river, the, pigeon, river, the, pic, river, the, white, river, the, michipicoten, river, the, bois, brule, river, and, the, kaministiquia, river, the, lake, s, outlet, at, st, marys, river, has, a, relatively, steep, gradient, with, rapids, the, soo, locks, enable, ships, to, bypass, the, rapids, and, to, overcome, the, 25, foot, 8, m, height, difference, between, lakes, superior, and, huron, the, lake, s, average, surface, elevation, is, 600, feet, 183, m, above, sea, level, until, approximately, 1887, the, natural, hydraulic, conveyance, through, the, st, marys, river, rapids, determined, the, outflow, from, lake, superior, by, 1921, development, in, support, of, transportation, and, hydroelectric, power, resulted, in, gates, locks, power, canals, and, other, control, structures, completely, spanning, st, marys, rapids, the, regulating, structure, is, known, as, the, compensating, works, and, is, operated, according, to, a, regulation, plan, known, as, plan, 1977, a, water, levels, including, diversions, of, water, from, the, hudson, bay, watershed, are, regulated, by, the, international, lake, superior, board, of, control, which, was, established, in, 1914, by, the, international, joint, commission, lake, superior, s, water, level, was, at, a, new, record, low, in, september, 2007, slightly, less, than, the, previous, record, low, in, 1926, water, levels, recovered, within, a, few, days, historic, high, water, the, lake, s, water, level, fluctuates, from, month, to, month, with,

surrounding, area, summer, surface, temperatures, in, the, lake, appeared, to, have, increased, by, about, 4, 5, f, 2, 5, c, between, 1979, and, 2007, compared, with, an, approximately, 2, 7, f, 1, 5, c, increase, in, the, surrounding, average, air, temperature, the, increase, in, the, lake, s, surface, temperature, may, be, related, to, the, decreasing, ice, cover, less, winter, ice, cover, allows, more, solar, radiation, to, penetrate, and, warm, the, water, if, trends, continue, lake, superior, which, freezes, over, completely, once, every, 20, years, could, routinely, be, ice, free,

inhabited, the, lake, superior, region, for, over, five, hundred, years, and, were, preceded, by, the, dakota, meskwaki, fox, menominee, nipigon, noquet, and, gros, ventres, after, the, arrival, of, europeans, the, anishinaabe, made, themselves, middle, men, between, the, french, fur, traders, and, other, native, peoples, they, soon, became, the, dominant, native, american, nation, in, the, region, they, forced, out, the, sioux, and, fox, and, won, a, victory, against, the, iroquois, west, of, sault, ste, marie, in, 1662, by, the, mid, 18th, century, the, ojibwe, occupied, all, of, lake, superior, s, shores, in, the, 18th, century, as, the, booming, fur, trade, supplied, europe, with, beaver, hats, the, hudson, s, bay, company, had, a, virtual, monopoly, in, the, region, until, 1783,

whereas, the, first, steamers, on, the, other, great, lakes, began, sailing, in, 1816, ice, closes, the, lake, shipping, from, mid, january, to, late, march, exact, dates, for, the, shipping, season, vary, each, year, depending, on, weather, conditions, that, form, and, break, the, ice, the, southern, shore, of, lake, superior, between, grand, marais, michigan, and, whitefish, point, is, known, as, the, graveyard, of, the, great, lakes, more, ships, have, been, lost, around, the, whitefish, point, area, than, any, other, part, of, lake, superior, these, shipwrecks, are, now, protected, by, the, whitefish, point, underwater, preserve, storms, that, claimed, multiple, ships, include, the, mataafa, storm, in, november, 1905, and, the, great, lakes, storm, of, 1913, wreckage, of, ss,

november, 10, 1975, the, wreck, was, immortalized, by, gordon, lightfoot, in, his, ballad, the, wreck, of, the, edmund, fitzgerald, all, 29, crew, members, died, and, no, bodies, were, recovered, edmund, fitzgerald, was, battered, so, intensely, by, lake, superior, that, the, 729, foot, 222, m, ship, split, in, half, her, two, pieces, lie, approximately, 170, feet, 52, m, apart, at, a, depth, of, 88, fathoms, 530, ft, or, 160, m, lightfoot, sings, that, superior, they, said, never, gives, up, her, dead, this, is, because, of, the, unusually, cold, water, under, 36, f, 2, c, on, average, around, 1970, normally, bacteria, decaying, a, sunken, body, will, bloat, it, with, gas, causing, it, to, float, to, the, surface, after, a, few, days, but, lake, superior, s, water, is, cold, enough, year, round, to, inhibit, bacterial, growth, and, bodies, tend, to, sink, and, never, resurface, joe, macinnis, reported, that, in, july, 1994, explorer, frederick, shannon, s, expedition, 94, to, the, wreck, of, edmund, fitzgerald, discovered, a, man, s, body, near, the, port, side, of, her, pilothouse, not, far, from, the, open, door, fully, clothed, wearing, an, orange, life, jacket, and, lying, face, down, in, the, sediment, in, february, 2024, it, was, announced, that, wreckage, from, the, arlington, was, discovered, from, a, sinking, in, 1940, more, than, 80, species, of, fish, have, been, found, in, lake, superior, species, native, to, the, lake, include, banded, killifish, bloater, brook, trout, burbot, cisco, lake, sturgeon, lake, trout, lake, whitefish, longnose, sucker, muskellunge, northern, pike, pumpkinseed, rock, bass, round, whitefish, smallmouth, bass, walleye, white, sucker, and, yellow, perch, in, addition, many, fish, species, have, been, either, intentionally, or, accidentally, introduced, to, lake, superior, atlantic, salmon, brown, trout, carp, chinook, salmon, coho, salmon, freshwater, drum, pink, salmon, rainbow, smelt, rainbow, trout, round, goby, ruffe, sea, lamprey, and, white, perch, lake, superior, has, fewer, dissolved, nutrients, relative, to, its, water, volume, than, the, other, great, lakes, and, so, is, less, productive, in, terms, of, fish, populations, and, is, an, oligotrophic, lake, this, is, a, result, of, the, underdeveloped, soils, found, in, its, relatively, small, watershed, it, is, also, a, reflection, of, relatively, small, human, population, and, small, amount, of, agriculture, in, its, watershed, however, nitrate, concentrations, in, the, lake, have, been, continuously, rising, for, more, than, a, century, they, are, still, much, lower, than, levels, considered, dangerous, to, human, health, but, this, steady, long, term, rise, is, an, unusual, record, of, environmental, nitrogen, buildup, it, may, relate, to, anthropogenic, alternations, to, the, regional, nitrogen, cycle, but, researchers, are, still, unsure, of, the, causes, of, this, change, to, the, lake, s, ecology, as, for, other, great, lakes, fish, populations, have, also, been, affected, by, the, accidental, or, intentional, introduction, of, foreign, species, such, as, the, sea, lamprey, and, eurasian, ruffe, accidental, introductions, have, occurred, in, part, by, the, removal, of, natural, barriers, to, navigation, between, the, great, lakes, overfishing, has, also, been, a, factor, in, the, decline, of, fish, populations
