the, nile, also, known, as, the, nile, river, is, a, major, north, flowing, river, in, northeastern, africa, it, flows, into, the, mediterranean, sea, the, nile, is, the, longest, river, in, africa, it, has, historically, been, considered, the, longest, river, in, the, world, though, this, has, been, contested, by, research, suggesting, that, the, amazon, river, is, slightly, longer, of, the, world, s, major, rivers, the, nile, is, one, of, the, smallest, as, measured, by, annual, flow, in, cubic, metres, of, water, about, 6, 650, km, 4, 130, mi, long, its, drainage, basin, covers, eleven, countries, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, tanzania, burundi, rwanda, uganda, kenya, ethiopia, eritrea, south, sudan, sudan, and, egypt, in, particular, the, nile, is, the, primary, water, source, of, egypt, sudan, and, south, sudan, the, nile, is, an, important, economic, driver, supporting, agriculture, and, fishing, the, nile, has, two, major, tributaries, the, white, nile, and, the, blue, nile, the, white, nile, is, traditionally, considered, to, be, the, headwaters, stream, however, the, blue, nile, is, the, source, of, most, of, the, water, of, the, nile, downstream, containing, 80, of, the, water, and, silt, the, white, nile, is, longer, and, rises, in, the, great, lakes, region, it, begins, at, lake, victoria, and, flows, through, uganda, and, south, sudan, the, blue, nile, begins, at, lake, tana, in, ethiopia, and, flows, into, sudan, from, the, southeast, the, two, rivers, meet, at, the, sudanese, capital, of, khartoum, the, northern, section, of, the, river, flows, north, almost, entirely, through, the, nubian, desert, to, cairo, and, its, large, delta, and, the, river, flows, into, the, mediterranean, sea, at, alexandria, egyptian, civilization, and, sudanese, kingdoms, have, depended, on, the, river, and, its, annual, flooding, since, ancient, times, most, of, the, population, and, cities, of, egypt, lie, along, those, parts, of, the, nile, valley, north, of, the, aswan, dam, nearly, all, the, cultural, and, historical, sites, of, ancient, egypt, developed, and, are, found, along, river, banks, the, nile, is, with, the, rh, ne, and, po, one, of, the, three, mediterranean, rivers, with, the, largest, water, discharge, the, standard, english, names, white, nile, and, blue, nile, refer, to, the, river, s, source, derived, from, arabic, names, formerly, applied, to, only, the, sudanese, stretches, that, meet, at, khartoum, in, the, ancient, egyptian, language, the, nile, is, called, py, hapy, or, jtrw, iteru, meaning, river, in, coptic, the, word, pronounced, piaro, sahidic, or, phiaro, bohairic, means, the, river, lit, p, h, iar, o, the, canal, great, and, comes, from, the, same, ancient, name, in, nobiin, the, river, is, called, man, daw, meaning, the, great, water, in, luganda, the, river, is, called, kiira, or, kiyira, in, runyoro, it, is, called, kihiira, in, egyptian, arabic, the, nile, is, called, en, n, l, while, in, standard, arabic, it, is, called, an, n, l, in, biblical, hebrew, it, is, ha, ye, or, or, ha, shi, or, the, english, name, nile, and, the, arabic, names, en, n, l, and, an, n, l, both, derive, from, the, latin, nilus, and, the, ancient, greek, beyond, that, however, the, etymology, is, disputed, homer, called, the, river, aiguptos, but, in, subsequent, periods, greek, authors, referred, to, its, lower, course, as, neilos, this, term, became, generalised, for, the, entire, river, system, thus, the, name, may, derive, from, ancient, egyptian, expression, n, r, w, w, t, lit, the, mouths, of, the, front, parts, which, referred, specifically, to, the, branches, of, the, nile, transversing, the, delta, and, would, have, been, pronounced, ni, lo, he, in, the, area, around, memphis, in, the, 8th, century, bce, hesiod, at, his, theogony, refers, to, nilus, as, one, of, the, potamoi, river, gods, son, of, oceanus, and, tethys, another, derivation, of, nile, might, be, related, to, the, term, nil, sanskrit, romanized, nila, egyptian, arabic, which, refers, to, indigofera, tinctoria, one, of, the, original, sources, of, indigo, dye, another, may, be, nymphaea, caerulea, known, as, the, sacred, blue, lily, of, the, nile, which, was, found, scattered, over, tutankhamun, s, corpse, when, it, was, excavated, in, 1922, another, possible, etymology, derives, from, the, semitic, term, nahal, meaning, river, old, libyan, has, the, term, lilu, meaning, water, in, modern, berber, ilel, means, sea, with, a, total, length, of, about, 6, 650, km, 4, 130, mi, between, the, region, of, lake, victoria, and, the, mediterranean, sea, the, nile, is, among, the, longest, rivers, on, earth, the, drainage, basin, of, the, nile, covers, 3, 254, 555, square, kilometers, 1, 256, 591, sq, mi, about, 10, of, the, area, of, africa, compared, to, other, major, rivers, though, the, nile, carries, little, water, 5, of, that, of, the, congo, river, for, example, the, nile, basin, is, complex, and, because, of, this, the, discharge, at, any, given, point, along, the, main, stem, depends, on, many, factors, including, weather, diversions, evaporation, and, evapotranspiration, and, groundwater, flow, upstream, from, khartoum, to, the, south, the, river, is, known, as, the, white, nile, a, term, also, used, in, a, limited, sense, to, describe, the, section, between, lake, no, and, khartoum, at, khartoum, the, river, is, joined, by, the, blue, nile, the, white, nile, starts, in, equatorial, east, africa, and, the, blue, nile, begins, in, ethiopia, both, branches, are, on, the, western, flanks, of, the, east, african, rift, the, source, of, the, blue, nile, is, lake, tana, in, the, gish, abay, region, in, the, ethiopian, highlands, the, source, of, the, white, nile, even, after, centuries, of, exploration, remains, in, dispute, the, most, remote, source, that, is, indisputably, a, source, for, the, white, nile, is, the, kagera, river, however, the, kagera, has, tributaries, that, are, in, contention, for, the, farthest, source, of, the, white, nile, two, start, in, burundi, the, ruvyironza, river, also, known, as, the, luvironza, and, the, rurubu, river, in, addition, in, 2010, an, exploration, party, in, rwanda, went, to, a, place, described, as, the, source, of, the, rukarara, tributary, and, by, hacking, a, path, up, steep, jungle, choked, mountain, slopes, in, the, nyungwe, forest, found, in, the, dry, season, an, appreciable, incoming, surface, flow, for, many, kilometres, upstream, and, found, a, new, source, giving, the, nile, a, length, of, 6, 758, km, 4, 199, mi, the, white, nile, leaves, lake, victoria, at, ripon, falls, near, jinja, uganda, as, the, victoria, nile, it, flows, north, for, some, 130, kilometers, 81, mi, to, lake, kyoga, the, last, part, of, the, approximately, 200, kilometers, 120, mi, river, section, starts, from, the, western, shores, of, the, lake, and, flows, at, first, to, the, west, until, just, south, of, masindi, port, where, the, river, turns, north, then, makes, a, great, half, circle, to, the, east, and, north, to, karuma, falls, for, the, remaining, part, it, flows, westerly, through, the, murchison, falls, until, it, reaches, the, northern, shores, of, lake, albert, where, it, forms, a, significant, river, delta, lake, albert, is, on, the, border, of, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, but, the, nile, is, not, a, border, river, at, this, point, after, leaving, lake, albert, the, river, continues, north, through, uganda, and, is, known, as, the, albert, nile, the, white, nile, flows, into, south, sudan, just, south, of, nimule, where, it, is, known, as, the, bahr, al, jabal, mountain, river, just, south, of, the, town, is, the, confluence, with, the, achwa, river, the, bahr, al, ghazal, 716, kilometers, 445, mi, long, joins, the, bahr, al, jabal, at, a, small, lagoon, called, lake, no, after, which, the, nile, becomes, known, as, the, bahr, al, abyad, or, the, white, nile, from, the, whitish, clay, suspended, in, its, waters, when, the, nile, floods, it, leaves, a, rich, silty, deposit, which, fertilizes, the, soil, the, nile, no, longer, floods, in, egypt, since, the, completion, of, the, aswan, dam, in, 1970, an, anabranch, river, the, bahr, el, zeraf, flows, out, of, the, nile, s, bahr, al, jabal, section, and, rejoins, the, white, nile, the, flow, rate, of, the, bahr, al, jabal, at, mongalla, is, almost, constant, throughout, the, year, and, averages, 1, 048, m, 3, s, 37, 000, cu, ft, s, after, mongalla, the, bahr, al, jabal, enters, the, enormous, swamps, of, the, sudd, region, more, than, half, of, the, nile, s, water, is, lost, in, this, swamp, to, evaporation, and, transpiration, the, average, flow, rate, of, the, white, nile, at, the, tails, of, the, swamps, is, about, 510, m, 3, s, 18, 000, cu, ft, s, from, here, it, meets, with, the, sobat, river, at, malakal, on, an, annual, basis, the, white, nile, upstream, of, malakal, contributes, about, 15, of, the, total, outflow, of, the, nile, the, average, flow, of, the, white, nile, at, lake, kawaki, malakal, just, below, the, sobat, river, is, 924, m, 3, s, 32, 600, cu, ft, s, the, peak, flow, is, approximately, 1, 218, m, 3, s, 43, 000, cu, ft, s, in, october, and, minimum, flow, is, about, 609, m, 3, s, 21, 500, cu, ft, s, in, april, this, fluctuation, is, caused, by, the, substantial, variation, in, the, flow, of, the, sobat, which, has, a, minimum, flow, of, about, 99, m, 3, s, 3, 500, cu, ft, s, in, march, and, a, peak, flow, of, over, 680, m, 3, s, 24, 000, cu, ft, s, in, october, during, the, dry, season, january, to, june, the, white, nile, contributes, between, 70, and, 90, of, the, total, discharge, from, the, nile, below, renk, the, white, nile, enters, sudan, it, flows, north, to, khartoum, and, meets, the, blue, nile, the, course, of, the, nile, in, sudan, is, distinctive, it, flows, over, six, groups, of, cataracts, from, the, sixth, at, sabaloka, just, north, of, khartoum, northward, to, abu, hamad, the, tectonic, uplift, of, the, nubian, swell, diverts, the, river, south, west, for, over, 300, km, following, the, structure, of, the, central, african, shear, zone, embracing, the, bayuda, desert, at, al, dabbah, it, resumes, its, northward, course, towards, the, first, cataract, at, aswan, forming, the, s, shaped, great, bend, of, the, nile, mentioned, by, eratosthenes, in, the, north, of, sudan, the, river, enters, lake, nasser, known, in, sudan, as, lake, nubia, the, larger, part, of, which, is, in, egypt, below, the, aswan, dam, at, the, northern, limit, of, lake, nasser, the, nile, resumes, its, historic, course, north, of, cairo, the, nile, splits, into, two, branches, or, distributaries, that, feed, the, mediterranean, the, rosetta, branch, to, the, west, and, the, damietta, to, the, east, forming, the, nile, delta, the, annual, sediment, transport, by, the, nile, in, egypt, has, been, quantified, below, the, confluence, with, the, blue, nile, the, only, major, tributary, is, the, atbarah, river, also, known, as, the, red, nile, roughly, halfway, to, the, sea, it, originates, in, ethiopia, north, of, lake, tana, and, is, around, 800, kilometers, 500, mi, long, the, atbarah, flows, only, while, there, is, rain, in, ethiopia, and, dries, very, rapidly, during, the, dry, period, of, january, to, june, it, typically, dries, up, north, of, khartoum, the, blue, nile, amharic, bay, springs, from, lake, tana, in, the, ethiopian, highlands, the, blue, nile, flows, about, 1, 400, kilometres, to, khartoum, where, the, blue, nile, and, white, nile, join, to, form, the, nile, ninety, percent, of, the, water, and, ninety, six, percent, of, the, transported, sediment, carried, by, the, nile, come, from, the, atbarah, and, blue, nile, both, of, which, originate, in, ethiopia, with, fifty, nine, percent, of, the, water, coming, from, the, blue, nile, the, erosion, and, transportation, of, silt, only, occurs, during, the, ethiopian, rainy, season, when, rainfall, is, especially, high, in, the, ethiopian, highlands, the, rest, of, the, year, the, great, rivers, draining, ethiopia, into, the, nile, have, a, weaker, flow, in, harsh, and, arid, seasons, and, droughts, the, blue, nile, dries, out, completely, the, flow, of, the, blue, nile, varies, considerably, over, its, yearly, cycle, and, is, the, main, contribution, to, the, large, natural, variation, of, the, nile, flow, during, the, dry, season, the, natural, discharge, of, the, blue, nile, can, be, as, low, as, 113, m, 3, s, 4, 000, cu, ft, s, although, upstream, dams, regulate, the, flow, of, the, river, during, the, wet, season, the, peak, flow, of, the, blue, nile, often, exceeds, 5, 663, m, 3, s, 200, 000, cu, ft, s, in, late, august, a, difference, of, a, factor, of, 50, before, the, placement, of, dams, on, the, river, the, yearly, discharge, varied, by, a, factor, of, 15, at, aswan, peak, flows, of, over, 8, 212, m, 3, s, 290, 000, cu, ft, s, occurred, during, late, august, and, early, september, and, minimum, flows, of, about, 552, m, 3, s, 19, 500, cu, ft, s, occurred, during, late, april, and, early, may, the, bahr, al, ghazal, and, the, sobat, river, are, the, two, most, important, tributaries, of, the, white, nile, in, terms, of, discharge, the, bahr, al, ghazal, s, drainage, basin, is, the, largest, of, any, of, the, nile, s, sub, basins, measuring, 520, 000, square, kilometers, 200, 000, sq, mi, in, size, but, it, contributes, a, relatively, small, amount, of, water, about, 2, m, 3, s, 71, cu, ft, s, annually, because, tremendous, volumes, of, water, are, lost, in, the, sudd, wetlands, the, sobat, river, which, joins, the, nile, a, short, distance, below, lake, no, drains, about, half, as, much, land, 225, 000, km, 2, 86, 900, sq, mi, but, contributes, 412, cubic, meters, per, second, 14, 500, cu, ft, s, annually, to, the, nile, when, in, flood, the, sobat, carries, a, large, amount, of, sediment, adding, greatly, to, the, white, nile, s, color, the, yellow, nile, is, a, former, tributary, that, connected, the, ouadda, highlands, of, eastern, chad, to, the, nile, river, valley, c, 8000, to, c, 1000, bce, its, remains, are, known, as, the, wadi, howar, the, wadi, passes, through, gharb, darfur, near, the, northern, border, with, chad, and, meets, up, with, the, nile, near, the, southern, point, of, the, great, bend, the, nile, has, been, the, lifeline, of, civilization, in, egypt, since, the, stone, age, with, most, of, the, population, and, all, of, the, cities, of, egypt, developing, along, those, parts, of, the, nile, valley, lying, north, of, aswan, however, the, nile, used, to, run, much, more, westerly, through, what, is, now, wadi, hamim, and, wadi, al, maqar, in, libya, and, flow, into, the, gulf, of, sidra, as, the, sea, level, rose, at, the, end, of, the, most, recent, ice, age, the, stream, which, is, now, the, northern, nile, captured, the, ancestral, nile, near, asyut, this, change, in, climate, also, led, to, the, current, extents, of, the, sahara, desert, around, 3400, bce, the, giza, pyramid, complex, originally, overlooked, a, branch, of, the, nile, that, no, longer, exists, this, branch, was, highest, during, the, african, humid, period, the, existing, nile, has, five, earlier, phases, flowing, north, from, the, ethiopian, highlands, satellite, imagery, was, used, to, identify, dry, watercourses, in, the, desert, to, the, west, of, the, nile, a, canyon, now, filled, by, surface, drift, represents, the, eonile, that, flowed, during, 23, 5, 3, million, years, before, present, the, eonile, transported, clastic, sediments, to, the, mediterranean, several, natural, gas, fields, have, been, discovered, within, these, sediments, during, the, late, miocene, messinian, salinity, crisis, when, the, mediterranean, sea, was, a, closed, basin, and, evaporated, to, the, point, of, being, empty, or, nearly, so, the, nile, cut, its, course, down, to, the, new, base, level, until, it, was, several, hundred, metres, below, world, ocean, level, at, aswan, and, 2, 400, m, 7, 900, ft, below, cairo, this, created, a, very, long, and, deep, canyon, which, was, filled, with, sediment, after, the, mediterranean, was, recreated, at, some, point, the, sediments, raised, the, riverbed, sufficiently, for, the, river, to, overflow, westward, into, a, depression, to, create, lake, moeris, lake, tanganyika, drained, northwards, into, the, nile, until, the, virunga, volcanoes, blocked, its, course, in, rwanda, the, nile, was, much, longer, at, that, time, with, its, furthest, headwaters, in, northern, zambia, the, currently, existing, nile, first, flowed, during, the, former, parts, of, the, w, rm, glaciation, period, affad, 23, is, an, archaeological, site, located, in, alluvial, deposits, formed, by, an, ancient, channel, of, the, nile, in, the, affad, region, of, southern, dongola, reach, sudan, there, are, two, theories, about, the, age, of, the, integrated, nile, one, is, that, the, integrated, drainage, of, the, nile, is, of, young, age, and, that, the, nile, basin, was, formerly, broken, into, series, of, separate, basins, only, the, most, northerly, of, which, fed, a, river, following, the, present, course, of, the, nile, in, egypt, and, sudan, rushdi, said, postulates, that, egypt, supplied, most, of, the, waters, of, the, nile, during, the, early, part, of, its, history, the, other, theory, is, that, the, drainage, from, ethiopia, via, rivers, equivalent, to, the, blue, nile, the, atbara, and, the, takazze, flowed, to, the, mediterranean, via, the, egyptian, nile, since, well, back, into, tertiary, times, salama, suggests, that, during, the, paleogene, and, neogene, periods, 66, million, to, 2, 588, million, years, ago, a, series, of, separate, closed, continental, basins, each, occupied, one, of, the, major, parts, of, the, sudanese, rift, system, mellut, rift, white, nile, rift, blue, nile, rift, atbara, rift, and, sag, el, naam, rift, the, mellut, basin, is, nearly, 12, kilometers, 7, 5, mi, deep, at, its, central, part, this, rift, is, possibly, still, active, with, reported, tectonic, activity, in, its, northern, and, southern, boundaries, the, sudd, swamp, which, forms, the, central, part, of, the, basin, may, still, be, subsiding, the, white, nile, rift, system, although, shallower, than, the, bahr, el, arab, rift, is, about, 9, kilometers, 5, 6, mi, deep, geophysical, exploration, of, the, blue, nile, rift, system, estimated, the, depth, of, the, sediments, to, be, 5, 9, kilometers, 3, 1, 5, 6, mi, these, basins, were, not, interconnected, until, their, subsidence, ceased, and, the, rate, of, sediment, deposition, was, enough, to, fill, and, connect, them, the, egyptian, nile, connected, to, the, sudanese, nile, which, captures, the, ethiopian, and, equatorial, headwaters, during, the, current, stages, of, tectonic, activity, in, the, eastern, central, and, sudanese, rift, systems, the, connection, of, the, different, niles, occurred, during, cyclic, wet, periods, the, atbarah, overflowed, its, closed, basin, during, the, wet, periods, that, occurred, about, 100, 000, to, 120, 000, years, ago, the, blue, nile, connected, to, the, main, nile, during, the, 70, 000, 80, 000, years, b, p, wet, period, the, white, nile, system, in, bahr, el, arab, and, white, nile, rifts, remained, a, closed, lake, until, the, connection, of, the, victoria, nile, to, the, main, system, some, 12, 500, years, ago, during, the, african, humid, period, the, greek, historian, herodotus, wrote, that, egypt, was, the, gift, of, the, nile, an, unending, source, of, sustenance, it, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, development, of, egyptian, civilization, because, the, river, overflowed, its, banks, annually, and, deposited, new, layers, of, silt, the, surrounding, land, was, very, fertile, the, ancient, egyptians, cultivated, and, traded, wheat, flax, papyrus, and, other, crops, around, the, nile, wheat, was, a, crucial, crop, in, the, famine, plagued, middle, east, this, trading, system, secured, egypt, s, diplomatic, relationships, with, other, countries, and, contributed, to, economic, stability, far, reaching, trade, has, been, carried, on, along, the, nile, since, ancient, times, a, tune, hymn, to, the, nile, was, created, and, sung, by, the, ancient, egyptian, peoples, about, the, flooding, of, the, nile, river, and, all, of, the, miracles, it, brought, to, ancient, egyptian, civilization, water, buffalo, were, introduced, from, asia, and, the, assyrians, introduced, camels, in, the, 7th, century, bce, these, animals, were, raised, for, meat, and, were, domesticated, and, used, for, ploughing, or, in, the, camels, case, carriage, water, was, vital, to, both, people, and, livestock, the, nile, was, also, a, convenient, and, efficient, means, of, transportation, for, people, and, goods, the, nile, was, also, an, important, part, of, ancient, egyptian, spiritual, life, hapi, was, the, god, of, the, annual, floods, and, both, he, and, the, pharaoh, were, thought, to, control, the, flooding, the, nile, was, considered, to, be, a, causeway, from, life, to, death, and, the, afterlife, the, east, was, thought, of, as, a, place, of, birth, and, growth, and, the, west, was, considered, the, place, of, death, as, the, god, ra, the, sun, underwent, birth, death, and, resurrection, each, day, as, he, crossed, the, sky, thus, all, tombs, were, west, of, the, nile, because, the, egyptians, believed, that, in, order, to, enter, the, afterlife, they, had, to, be, buried, on, the, side, that, symbolized, death, as, the, nile, was, such, an, important, factor, in, egyptian, life, the, ancient, calendar, was, even, based, on, the, three, cycles, of, the, nile, these, seasons, each, consisting, of, four, months, of, thirty, days, each, were, called, akhet, peret, and, shemu, akhet, which, means, inundation, was, the, time, of, the, year, when, the, nile, flooded, leaving, several, layers, of, fertile, soil, behind, aiding, in, agricultural, growth, peret, was, the, growing, season, and, shemu, the, last, season, was, the, harvest, season, when, there, were, no, rains, owing, to, their, failure, to, penetrate, the, sudd, wetlands, of, south, sudan, the, upper, reaches, of, the, white, nile, remained, largely, unknown, to, the, ancient, greeks, and, romans, vitruvius, thought, that, source, of, the, nile, was, in, mauritania, on, the, other, south, side, of, the, atlas, mountains, various, expeditions, failed, to, determine, the, river, s, source, agatharchides, records, that, in, the, time, of, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, a, military, expedition, had, penetrated, far, enough, along, the, course, of, the, blue, nile, to, determine, that, the, summer, floods, were, caused, by, heavy, seasonal, rainstorms, in, the, ethiopian, highlands, but, no, european, of, antiquity, is, known, to, have, reached, lake, tana, the, tabula, rogeriana, depicted, the, source, as, three, lakes, in, 1154, europeans, began, to, learn, about, the, origins, of, the, nile, in, the, 14th, century, when, the, pope, sent, monks, as, emissaries, to, mongolia, who, passed, india, the, middle, east, and, africa, and, described, being, told, of, the, source, of, the, nile, in, abyssinia, ethiopia, later, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, travelers, to, ethiopia, visited, lake, tana, and, the, source, of, the, blue, nile, in, the, mountains, south, of, the, lake, supposedly, paolo, trevisani, c, 1452, 1483, a, venetian, traveller, in, ethiopia, wrote, a, journal, of, his, travels, to, the, origin, of, the, nile, that, has, since, been, lost, although, james, bruce, claimed, to, be, the, first, european, to, have, visited, the, headwaters, modern, writers, give, the, credit, to, the, jesuit, pedro, p, ez, p, ez, s, account, of, the, source, of, the, nile, is, a, long, and, vivid, account, of, ethiopia, it, was, published, in, full, only, in, the, early, 20th, century, although, it, was, featured, in, works, of, p, ez, s, contemporaries, including, baltazar, t, llez, athanasius, kircher, and, johann, michael, vansleb, europeans, had, been, resident, in, ethiopia, since, the, late, 15th, century, and, one, of, them, may, have, visited, the, headwaters, even, earlier, without, leaving, a, written, trace, the, portuguese, jo, o, bermudes, published, the, first, description, of, the, tis, issat, falls, in, his, 1565, memoirs, compared, them, to, the, nile, falls, alluded, to, in, cicero, s, de, republica, jer, nimo, lobo, describes, the, source, of, the, blue, nile, visiting, shortly, after, pedro, p, ez, telles, also, uses, his, account, the, white, nile, was, even, less, understood, the, ancients, mistakenly, believed, that, the, niger, river, represented, the, upper, reaches, of, the, white, nile, for, example, pliny, the, elder, writes, that, the, nile, had, its, origins, in, a, mountain, of, lower, mauretania, flowed, above, ground, for, many, days, distance, then, went, underground, reappeared, as, a, large, lake, in, the, territories, of, the, masaesyli, then, sank, again, below, the, desert, to, flow, underground, for, a, distance, of, 20, days, journey, till, it, reaches, the, nearest, ethiopians, modern, exploration, of, the, nile, basin, began, with, the, conquest, of, the, northern, and, central, sudan, by, the, ottoman, viceroy, of, egypt, muhammad, ali, and, his, sons, from, 1821, onward, as, a, result, of, this, the, blue, nile, was, known, as, far, as, its, exit, from, the, ethiopian, foothills, and, the, white, nile, as, far, as, the, mouth, of, the, sobat, river, three, expeditions, under, a, turkish, officer, selim, bimbashi, were, made, between, 1839, and, 1842, and, two, got, to, the, point, about, 30, kilometres, 20, miles, beyond, the, present, port, of, juba, where, the, country, rises, and, rapids, make, navigation, very, difficult, lake, victoria, was, first, sighted, by, europeans, in, 1858, when, british, explorer, john, hanning, speke, reached, its, southern, shore, while, traveling, with, richard, francis, burton, to, explore, central, africa, and, locate, the, great, lakes, believing, he, had, found, the, source, of, the, nile, on, seeing, this, vast, expanse, of, open, water, for, the, first, time, speke, named, the, lake, after, queen, victoria, burton, recovering, from, illness, and, resting, further, south, on, the, shores, of, lake, tanganyika, was, outraged, that, speke, claimed, to, have, proven, his, discovery, to, be, the, true, source, of, the, nile, when, burton, regarded, this, as, still, unsettled, a, quarrel, ensued, which, sparked, intense, debate, within, the, scientific, community, and, interest, by, other, explorers, keen, to, either, confirm, or, refute, speke, s, discovery, british, explorer, and, missionary, david, livingstone, pushed, too, far, west, and, entered, the, congo, river, system, instead, it, was, ultimately, welsh, american, explorer, henry, morton, stanley, who, confirmed, speke, s, discovery, circumnavigating, lake, victoria, and, reporting, the, great, outflow, at, ripon, falls, on, the, lake, s, northern, shore, the, nile, has, long, been, used, to, transport, goods, along, its, length, winter, winds, blow, south, up, river, so, ships, could, sail, up, river, using, sails, and, down, river, using, the, flow, of, the, river, while, most, egyptians, still, live, in, the, nile, valley, the, 1970, completion, of, the, aswan, dam, ended, the, summer, floods, and, their, renewal, of, the, fertile, soil, fundamentally, changing, farming, practices, the, nile, supports, much, of, the, population, living, along, its, banks, enabling, egyptians, to, live, in, otherwise, inhospitable, regions, of, the, sahara, the, river, s, flow, is, disturbed, at, several, points, by, the, cataracts, of, the, nile, which, form, an, obstacle, to, navigation, by, boats, the, sudd, also, forms, a, formidable, navigation, obstacle, and, impedes, water, flow, to, the, extent, that, sudan, had, once, attempted, to, build, the, jonglei, canal, to, bypass, the, swamp, nile, cities, include, khartoum, aswan, luxor, thebes, and, the, giza, cairo, conurbation, the, first, cataract, the, closest, to, the, mouth, of, the, river, is, at, aswan, north, of, the, aswan, dam, this, part, of, the, river, is, a, regular, tourist, route, with, cruise, ships, and, traditional, wooden, sailing, boats, known, as, feluccas, many, cruise, ships, ply, the, route, between, luxor, and, aswan, stopping, at, edfu, and, kom, ombo, along, the, way, security, concerns, have, limited, cruising, on, the, northernmost, portion, for, many, years, a, computer, simulation, study, to, plan, the, economic, development, of, the, nile, was, directed, by, h, a, w, morrice, and, w, n, allan, for, the, ministry, of, hydro, power, of, sudan, during, 1955, 57, morrice, was, their, hydrological, adviser, and, allan, his, predecessor, the, calculations, were, enabled, by, accurate, monthly, inflow, data, collected, for, 50, years, the, underlying, principle, was, the, use, of, over, year, storage, to, conserve, water, from, rainy, years, for, use, in, dry, years, irrigation, navigation, and, other, needs, were, considered, each, computer, run, postulated, a, set, of, reservoirs, and, operating, equations, for, the, release, of, water, as, a, function, of, the, month, and, the, levels, upstream, the, behavior, that, would, have, resulted, given, the, inflow, data, was, modeled, over, 600, models, were, run, recommendations, were, made, to, the, sudanese, authorities, the, calculations, were, run, on, an, ibm, 650, computer, simulation, studies, to, design, water, resources, are, discussed, further, in, the, article, on, hydrology, transport, models, which, have, been, used, since, the, 1980s, to, analyze, water, quality, despite, the, development, of, many, reservoirs, drought, during, the, 1980s, led, to, widespread, starvation, in, ethiopia, and, sudan, but, egypt, was, nourished, by, water, impounded, in, lake, nasser, drought, has, proven, to, be, a, major, cause, of, fatality, in, the, nile, river, basin, according, to, a, report, by, the, strategic, foresight, group, droughts, in, the, last, century, have, affected, around, 170, million, people, and, killed, half, a, million, people, from, the, 70, incidents, of, drought, which, took, place, between, 1900, and, 2012, 55, incidents, took, place, in, ethiopia, sudan, south, sudan, kenya, and, tanzania, the, nile, s, water, has, affected, the, politics, of, east, africa, and, the, horn, of, africa, for, many, decades, the, dispute, between, egypt, and, ethiopia, over, the, 4, 5, billion, grand, ethiopian, renaissance, dam, has, become, a, national, preoccupation, in, both, countries, stoking, patriotism, deep, seated, fears, and, even, murmurs, of, war, countries, including, uganda, sudan, ethiopia, and, kenya, have, complained, about, egyptian, domination, of, its, water, resources, the, nile, basin, initiative, promotes, a, peaceful, cooperation, among, those, states, several, attempts, have, been, made, to, establish, agreements, between, the, countries, sharing, the, nile, waters, on, 14, may, 2010, at, entebbe, uganda, ethiopia, rwanda, and, tanzania, signed, a, new, agreement, on, sharing, the, nile, water, even, though, this, agreement, raised, strong, opposition, from, egypt, and, sudan, ideally, such, international, agreements, should, promote, equitable, and, efficient, usage, of, the, nile, basin, s, water, resources, without, a, better, understanding, about, the, availability, of, the, future, water, resources, of, the, nile, it, is, possible, that, conflicts, could, arise, between, these, countries, relying, on, the, nile, for, their, water, supply, economic, and, social, developments, in, 1951, american, john, goddard, together, with, two, french, explorers, became, the, first, to, successfully, navigate, the, entire, nile, from, its, source, in, burundi, at, the, potential, headsprings, of, the, kagera, river, in, burundi, to, its, mouth, on, the, mediterranean, sea, a, journey, of, approximately, 6, 800, km, 4, 200, mi, their, 9, month, journey, is, described, in, the, book, kayaks, down, the, nile, the, white, nile, expedition, led, by, south, african, national, hendrik, coetzee, navigated, the, white, nile, s, entire, length, of, approximately, 3, 700, kilometres, 2, 300, mi, the, expedition, began, at, the, white, nile, s, beginning, at, lake, victoria, in, uganda, on, 17, january, 2004, and, arrived, at, the, mediterranean, in, rosetta, four, and, a, half, months, later, the, blue, nile, expedition, led, by, geologist, pasquale, scaturro, and, his, partner, kayaker, and, documentary, filmmaker, gordon, brown, became, the, first, known, people, to, descend, the, entire, blue, nile, from, lake, tana, in, ethiopia, to, the, beaches, of, alexandria, on, the, mediterranean, their, approximately, 5, 230, kilometre, 3, 250, mi, journey, took, 114, days, from, 25, december, 2003, to, 28, april, 2004, though, their, expedition, included, others, brown, and, scaturro, were, the, only, ones, to, complete, the, entire, journey, although, they, descended, whitewater, manually, the, team, used, outboard, motors, for, much, of, their, journey, on, 29, january, 2005, canadian, les, jickling, and, new, zealander, mark, tanner, completed, the, first, human, powered, transit, of, ethiopia, s, blue, nile, their, journey, of, over, 5, 000, kilometres, 3, 100, mi, took, five, months, they, recount, that, they, paddled, through, two, war, zones, regions, notorious, for, bandits, and, were, arrested, at, gunpoint, the, following, bridges, cross, the, blue, nile, and, connect,
