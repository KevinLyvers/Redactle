who, sailed, far, north, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, used, the, islands, as, a, base, subsequently, the, archipelago, was, abandoned, coal, mining, started, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, and, several, permanent, communities, such, as, pyramiden, or, barentsburg, were, established, the, svalbard, treaty, of, 1920, recognizes, norwegian, sovereignty, and, the, norwegian, svalbard, act, of, 1925, made, svalbard, a, full, part, of, the, kingdom, of, norway, the, svalbard, treaty, established, svalbard, as, a, free, economic, zone, and, restricts, the, military, use, of, the, archipelago, the, norwegian, store, norske, and, the, russian, arktikugol, remain, the, only, mining, companies, in, place, research, and, tourism, have, become, important, supplementary,

include, the, russian, mining, community, of, barentsburg, the, norwegian, research, station, of, ny, lesund, and, the, swedish, norwegian, mining, outpost, of, sveagruva, which, closed, in, 2020, other, settlements, lie, farther, north, but, are, populated, only, by, rotating, groups, of, researchers, no, roads, connect, the, settlements, instead, snowmobiles, aircraft, and, boats, provide, inter, settlement, transport, svalbard, airport, serves, as, the, main, gateway, approximately, 60, of, the, archipelago, is, covered, with, glaciers, and, the, islands, feature, many, mountains, and, fjords, the, archipelago, has, an, arctic, climate, although, with, significantly, higher, temperatures, than, other, areas, at, the, same, latitude, the, flora, has, adapted, to, take, advantage, of, the, long, period, of, midnight, sun, to, compensate, for, the, polar, night, many, seabirds, use, svalbard, as, a, breeding, ground, and, it, is, home, to, polar, bears, reindeer, the, arctic, fox, and, certain, marine, mammals, seven, national, parks, and, 23, nature, reserves, cover, two, thirds, of, the, archipelago, protecting, the, largely, untouched, fragile, environment, norway, announced, new, regulations, regarding, tourism, in, february, 2024, including, a, maximum, of, 200, people, on, a, ship, to, protect, flora, and, fauna, in, svalbard, while, part, of, the, kingdom, of, norway, since, 1925, svalbard, is, not, part, of, geographical, norway, administratively, the, archipelago, is, not, part, of, any, norwegian, county, but, forms, an, unincorporated, area, this, means, that, it, is, administered, directly, by, the, norwegian, government, through, an, appointed, governor, and, is, a, special, jurisdiction, subject, to, the, svalbard, treaty, that, is, outside, of, the, schengen, area, the, nordic, passport, union, and, the, european, economic, area, svalbard, and, jan, mayen, are, collectively, assigned, the, iso, 3166, 1, alpha, 2, country, code, sj, both, areas, are, administered, by, norway, though, they, are, separated, by, a, distance, of, over, 950, kilometres, 510, nautical, miles, and, have, very, different, administrative, structures, the, name, svalbard, was, officially, adopted, for, the, archipelago, by, norway, under, the, 1925, svalbard, act, which, formally, annexed, it, the, former, name, spitsbergen, was, thenceforth, restricted, to, the, main, island, in, 1827, baltazar, keilhau, first, proposed, that, the, old, norse, toponym, svalbar, i, found, in, medieval, icelandic, sources, referred, to, spitsbergen, keilhau, s, theory, was, revived, by, gustav, storm, in, 1890, and, gunnar, isachsen, in, 1907, at, a, time, when, ancient, norse, connection, to, the, land, would, help, modern, norway, s, contested, claim, to, sovereignty, svalbard, is, a, modern, norwegian, analogue, of, svalbar, i, which, in, turn, derives, from, svalr, cold, and, bar, edge, ridge, turf, beard, the, icelandic, annals, record, that, svalbar, i, was, discovered, in, 1194, while, the, landn, mab, k, places, it, four, days, sailing, north, of, langanes, the, word, d, gr, day, might, mean, either, 12, or, 24, hours, isachsen, took, the, latter, interpretation, thus, discounting, jan, mayen, as, svalbar, i, cultural, studies, academic, roald, berg, says, svalbar, i, more, likely, referred, to, part, of, greenland, and, the, 1925, renaming, cemented, norwegian, sovereignty, as, recognised, by, the, 1920, spitsbergen, treaty, now, the, svalbard, treaty, the, name, spitsbergen, originated, with, dutch, navigator, and, explorer, willem, barentsz, who, in, 1596, described, the, pointed, mountains, or, in, dutch, spitse, bergen, that, he, saw, on, the, west, coast, of, the, main, island, barentsz, did, not, recognize, that, he, had, discovered, an, archipelago, and, consequently, the, name, spitsbergen, long, remained, in, use, both, for, the, main, island, and, for, the, archipelago, as, a, whole, later, the, main, island, was, sometimes, distinguished, as, west, spitsbergen, the, spelling, spitzbergen, with, z, instead, of, s, derives, from, german, the, svalbard, treaty, of, 1920, defines, svalbard, as, all, islands,

the, german, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, the, royal, navy, reconnoitered, the, islands, with, a, view, to, using, them, as, a, base, of, operations, to, send, supplies, to, north, russia, but, the, idea, was, rejected, as, impractical, instead, with, the, agreement, of, the, soviets, and, the, norwegian, government, in, exile, in, august, 1941, the, norwegian, and, soviet, settlements, on, svalbard, were, evacuated, and, facilities, there, destroyed, in, operation, gauntlet, however, the, norwegian, government, in, exile, decided, it, would, be, important, politically, to, establish, a, garrison, in, the, islands, which, was, done, in, may, 1942, during, operation, fritham, meanwhile, the, germans, responded, to, the, destruction, of, the, weather, station, by, establishing, a,
