period, 1971, 2000, 7, 922, 3, m, 3, s, 279, 770, cu, ft, s, the, niger, river, n, a, d, r, ny, j, r, french, le, fleuve, niger, is, the, main, river, of, west, africa, extending, about, 4, 180, kilometres, 2, 600, miles, its, drainage, basin, is, 2, 117, 700, km, 2, 817, 600, sq, mi, in, area, its, source, is, in, the, guinea, highlands, in, south, eastern, guinea, near, the, sierra, leone, border, it, runs, in, a, crescent, shape, through, mali, niger, on, the, border, with, benin, and, then, through, nigeria, discharging, through, a, massive, delta, known, as, the, niger, delta, into, the, gulf, of, guinea, in, the, atlantic, ocean, the, niger, is, the, third, longest, river, in, africa, exceeded, by, the, nile, and, the, congo, river, its, main, tributary, is, the, benue, river, the, niger, has, different, names, in, the, different, languages, of, the, region, the, earliest, use, of, the, name, niger, for, the, river, is, by, leo, africanus, in, his, della, descrittione, dell, africa, et, delle, cose, notabili, che, ivi, sono, published, in, italian, in, 1550, nevertheless, nigris, was, already, the, name, of, a, river, in, west, africa, as, mentioned, by, pliny, the, elder, and, solinus, among, others, whether, this, river, was, the, same, as, the, actual, niger, or, rather, the, river, also, known, as, ger, currently, known, as, oued, guir, in, morocco, is, a, matter, of, discussion, this, nigris, was, said, to, divide, africa, proper, from, the, land, of, the, western, ethiopians, to, the, south, and, its, name, as, well, as, that, of, the, river, ger, might, well, come, from, the, berber, phrase, gr, n, grwn, meaning, river, of, rivers, as, the, current, tuareg, name, for, the, river, niger, as, timbuktu, was, the, southern, end, of, the, principal, trans, saharan, trade, route, to, the, western, mediterranean, it, was, the, source, of, most, european, knowledge, of, the, region, medieval, european, maps, applied, the, name, niger, to, the, middle, reaches, of, the, river, in, modern, mali, but, quorra, kworra, to, the, lower, reaches, in, modern, nigeria, as, these, were, not, recognized, at, the, time, as, being, the, same, river, when, european, colonial, powers, began, to, send, ships, along, the, west, coast, of, africa, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, senegal, river, was, often, postulated, to, be, the, seaward, end, of, the, niger, the, niger, delta, pouring, into, the, atlantic, through, mangrove, swamps, and, thousands, of, distributaries, along, more, than, 160, kilometres, 100, mi, was, thought, to, be, coastal, wetlands, it, was, only, with, the, 18th, century, visits, of, mungo, park, who, travelled, down, the, niger, river, and, visited, the, great, sahelian, empires, of, his, day, that, europeans, correctly, identified, the, course, of, the, niger, and, extended, the, name, to, its, entire, course, the, modern, nations, of, nigeria, and, niger, take, their, names, from, the, river, marking, contesting, national, claims, by, colonial, powers, of, the, upper, lower, and, middle, niger, river, basin, during, the, scramble, for, africa, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, as, part, of, the, west, africa, sahel, region, niger, river, has, a, hot, climate, characterized, by, very, high, temperatures, year, round, a, long, intense, dry, season, from, october, may, and, a, brief, irregular, rainy, season, linked, to, the, west, african, monsoon, the, niger, river, is, a, relatively, clear, river, carrying, only, a, tenth, as, much, sediment, as, the, nile, because, the, niger, s, headwaters, lie, in, ancient, rocks, that, provide, little, silt, like, the, nile, the, niger, floods, yearly, this, begins, in, september, peaks, in, november, and, finishes, by, may, an, unusual, feature, of, the, river, is, the, inner, niger, delta, which, forms, where, its, gradient, suddenly, decreases, the, result, is, a, region, of, braided, streams, marshes, and, large, lakes, the, seasonal, floods, make, the, delta, extremely, productive, for, both, fishing, and, agriculture, the, river, loses, nearly, two, thirds, of, its, potential, flow, in, the, inner, delta, between, s, gou, and, timbuktu, to, seepage, and, evaporation, the, water, from, the, bani, river, which, flows, into, the, delta, at, mopti, does, not, compensate, for, the, losses, the, average, loss, is, estimated, at, 31, km, 3, year, but, varies, considerably, between, years, the, river, is, then, joined, by, various, tributaries, but, also, loses, more, water, to, evaporation, the, quantity, of, water, entering, nigeria, was, estimated, at, 25, km, 3, year, before, the, 1980s, and, at, 13, 5, km, 3, year, during, the, 1980s, the, most, important, tributary, is, the, benue, river, which, merges, with, the, niger, at, lokoja, in, nigeria, the, total, volume, of, tributaries, in, nigeria, is, six, times, higher, than, the, inflow, into, nigeria, with, a, flow, near, the, mouth, of, the, river, standing, at, 177, 0, km, 3, year, before, the, 1980s, and, 147, 3, km, 3, year, during, the, 1980s, the, niger, takes, one, of, the, most, unusual, routes, of, any, major, river, a, boomerang, shape, that, baffled, geographers, for, two, centuries, its, source, tembakounda, is, 240, km, 150, mi, inland, from, the, atlantic, ocean, but, the, river, runs, directly, away, from, the, sea, into, the, sahara, desert, then, takes, a, sharp, right, turn, near, the, ancient, city, of, timbuktu, and, heads, southeast, to, the, gulf, of, guinea, this, strange, geography, apparently, came, about, because, the, niger, river, is, two, ancient, rivers, joined, together, the, upper, niger, from, the, source, west, of, timbuktu, to, the, bend, in, the, current, river, near, timbuktu, once, emptied, into, a, now, dry, lake, to, the, east, northeast, of, timbuktu, while, the, lower, niger, started, to, the, south, of, timbuktu, and, flowed, south, into, the, gulf, of, guinea, over, time, upstream, erosion, by, the, lower, niger, resulted, in, stream, capture, of, the, upper, niger, by, the, lower, niger, the, northern, part, of, the, river, known, as, the, niger, bend, is, an, important, area, because, it, is, the, major, river, and, source, of, water, in, that, part, of, the, sahara, this, made, it, the, focal, point, of, trade, across, the, western, sahara, and, the, centre, of, the, sahelian, kingdoms, of, mali, and, gao, the, surrounding, niger, river, basin, is, one, of, the, distinct, physiographic, sections, of, the, sudan, province, which, in, turn, is, part, of, the, larger, african, massive, physiographic, division, the, niger, river, basin, located, in, western, africa, covers, 7, 5, of, the, continent, and, spreads, over, ten, countries, niger, river, basin, areas, and, rainfall, by, country, within, the, basin, rainfall, in, the, basin, mm, hydrometric, stations, on, the, niger, river, kilometer, rkm, m, km, 2, start, average, minimum, and, maximum,

plant, species, sharply, declined, humans, migrated, to, the, fertile, niger, river, bend, region, with, abundant, resources, including, plants, for, grazing, and, fish, like, in, the, fertile, crescent, many, food, crops, were, domesticated, in, the, niger, river, region, including, yams, african, rice, oryza, glaberrima, and, pearl, millet, the, sahara, aridification, may, have, triggered, or, at, least, accelerated, these, domestications, agriculture, as, well, as, fishing, and, animal, husbandry, led, to, the, rise, of, settlements, like, djenn, djenno, in, the, inner, delta, now, a, world, heritage, site, the, region, of, the, niger, bend, in, the, sahel, was, a, key, origin, and, destination, for, trans, saharan, trade, fueling, the, wealth, of, great, empires, such, as, the, ghana, mali, and, songhai, empires, major, trading, ports, along, the, river, including, timbuktu, and, gao, became, centers, of, learning, and, culture, trade, to, the, niger, bend, region, also, brought, islam, to, the, region, in, approximately, the, 14th, century, ce, much, of, the, northern, niger, basin, remains, muslim, today, although, the, southern, reaches, of, the, river, tend, to, be, christian, classical, writings, on, the, interior, of, the, sahara, begin, with, ptolemy, who, mentions, two, rivers, in, the, desert, the, gir, and, farther, south, the, nigir, the, first, has, been, since, identified, as, the, wadi, ghir, on, the, north, western, edge, of, the, tuat, along, the, borders, of, modern, morocco, and, algeria, this, would, likely, have, been, as, far, as, ptolemy, would, have, had, consistent, records, the, ni, ger, was, likely, speculation, although, the, name, stuck, as, that, of, a, river, south, of, the, mediterranean, s, known, world, suetonius, reports, romans, traveling, to, the, ger, although, in, reporting, any, river, s, name, derived, from, a, berber, language, in, which, gher, means, watercourse, confusion, could, easily, arise, pliny, connected, these, two, rivers, as, one, long, watercourse, which, flowed, via, lakes, and, underground, sections, into, the, nile, a, notion, which, persisted, in, the, arab, and, european, worlds, and, further, added, the, senegal, river, as, the, ger, until, the, 19th, century, while, the, true, course, of, the, niger, was, presumably, known, to, locals, it, was, a, mystery, to, the, outside, world, until, the, late, 18th, century, the, connection, to, the, nile, river, was, made, not, simply, because, this, was, then, known, as, the, great, river, of, aethiopia, by, which, all, lands, south, of, the, desert, were, called, by, classical, writers, but, because, the, nile, like, the, niger, flooded, every, summer, through, the, descriptions, of, leo, africanus, and, even, ibn, battuta, despite, his, visit, to, the, river, the, myth, connecting, the, niger, to, the, nile, persisted, many, european, expeditions, to, plot, the, river, were, unsuccessful, in, 1788, the, african, association, was, formed, in, england, to, promote, the, exploration, of, africa, in, the, hopes, of, locating, the, niger, and, in, june, 1796, the, scottish, explorer, mungo, park, was, the, first, european, to, lay, eyes, on, the, middle, portion, of, the, river, since, antiquity, and, perhaps, ever, he, wrote, an, account, in, 1799, travels, in, the, interior, of, africa, park, proposed, a, theory, that, the, niger, and, congo, were, the, same, river, although, the, niger, delta, would, seem, like, an, obvious, candidate, it, was, a, maze, of, streams, and, swamps, that, did, not, look, like, the, head, of, a, great, river, he, died, in, 1806, on, a, second, expedition, attempting, to, prove, the, niger, congo, connection, the, theory, became, the, leading, one, in, europe, several, failed, expeditions, followed, however, the, mystery, of, the, niger, would, not, be, solved, for, another, 25, years, in, 1830, when, richard, lander, and, his, brother, became, the, first, europeans, to, follow, the, course, of, the, niger, to, the, ocean, in, 1946, three, frenchmen, jean, sauvy, pierre, ponty, and, movie, maker, jean, rouch, former, civil, servants, in, the, african, french, colonies, set, out, to, travel, the, entire, length, of, the, river, as, no, one, else, seemed, to, have, done, previously, they, travelled, from, the, beginning, of, the, river, near, kissidougou, in, guinea, walking, at, first, till, a, raft, could, be, used, then, changing, to, various, local, crafts, as, the, river, broadened, and, changed, two, of, them, reached, the, ocean, on, march, 25, 1947, with, ponty, having, left, the, expedition, at, niamey, somewhat, past, the, halfway, mark, they, carried, a, 16mm, movie, camera, the, resulting, footage, giving, rouch, his, first, two, ethnographic, documentaries, au, pays, des, mages, noirs, and, la, chasse, l, hippopotame, a, camera, was, used, to, illustrate, rouch, s, subsequent, book, le, niger, en, pirogue, fernand, nathan, 1954, as, well, as, sauvy, s, descente, du, niger, l, harmattan, 2001, a, typewriter, was, brought, as, well, on, which, ponty, produced, newspaper, articles, he, mailed, out, whenever, possible, the, water, in, the, niger, river, basin, is, partially, regulated, through, dams, in, mali, the, s, lingu, dam, on, the, sankarani, river, is, mainly, used, for, hydropower, but, also, permits, irrigation, two, diversion, dams, one, at, sotuba, just, downstream, of, bamako, and, one, at, markala, just, downstream, of, s, gou, are, used, to, irrigate, about, 54, 000, hectares, in, nigeria, the, kainji, dam, shiroro, dam, zungeru, dam, and, jebba, dam, are, used, to, generate, hydropower, the, water, resources, of, the, niger, river, are, under, pressure, because, of, increased, water, abstraction, for, irrigation, the, construction, of, dams, for, hydropower, generation, is, underway, or, envisaged, in, order, to, alleviate, chronic, power, shortages, in, the, countries, of, the, niger, basin, the, fao, estimates, the, irrigation, potential, of, all, countries, in, the, niger, river, basin, at, 2, 8, million, hectares, only, 0, 93m, hectares, ha, were, under, irrigation, in, the, late, 1980s, the, irrigation, potential, was, estimated, at, 1, 68m, ha, in, nigeria, 0, 56m, ha, in, mali, and, the, actual, irrigated, area, was, 0, 67m, ha, and, 0, 19m,
