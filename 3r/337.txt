feet, slightly, less, than, that, of, the, tibetan, plateau, unlike, conditions, in, tibet, the, altiplano, is, dominated, by, massive, active, volcanoes, of, the, central, volcanic, zone, to, the,

altiplano, is, sometimes, used, to, identify, the, altitude, zone, and, the, type, of, climate, that, prevails, within, it, it, is, colder, than, that, of, the, tierra, fr, a, but, not, as, cold, as, that, of, the, tierra, helada, scientists, classify, the, latter, as, commencing, at, an, elevation, of, approximately, 4, 500, meters, or, about, 15, 000, feet, alternate, names, used, in, place, of,
