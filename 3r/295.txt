administratively, it, is, incorporated, as, novaya, zemlya, district, one, of, the, twenty, one, in, arkhangelsk, oblast, russia, municipally, it, is, incorporated, as, novaya, zemlya, urban, okrug, novaya, zemlya, was, a, sensitive, military, area, during, the, cold, war, and, parts, of, it, are, still, used, for, airfields, today, the, soviet, air, force, maintained, a, presence, at, rogachevo,

interceptor, aircraft, operations, but, also, provided, logistical, support, for, the, nearby, nuclear, test, area, novaya, zemlya, was, one, of, the, two, major, nuclear, test, sites, managed, by, the, ussr, along, with, the, semipalatinsk, test, site, it, was, used, for, air, drops, and, underground, testing, of, the, largest, of, soviet, nuclear, bombs, in, particular, the, october, 30, 1961, air, burst, explosion, of, tsar, bomba, the, largest, most, powerful, nuclear, weapon, ever, detonated, the, russian, people, knew, of, novaya, zemlya, from, the, 11th, century, when, hunters, from, novgorod, visited, the, area, for, western, europeans, the, search, for, the, northern, sea, route, in, the, 16th, century, led, to, its, exploration, the, first, visit, from, a, western, european, was, by, hugh, willoughby, in, 1553, dutch, explorer, willem, barentsz, reached, the, west, coast, of, novaya, zemlya, in, 1594, and, in, a, subsequent, expedition, of, 1596, he, rounded, the,

subsequently, deployed, to, cuba, 1963, saw, the, implementation, of, the, limited, test, ban, treaty, which, banned, most, atmospheric, nuclear, tests, the, largest, underground, test, in, novaya, zemlya, took, place, on, september, 12, 1973, involving, four, nuclear, devices, of, 4, 2, megatons, total, yield, although, far, smaller, in, blast, power, than, the, tsar, bomba, and, other, atmospheric, tests, the, confinement, of, the, blasts, underground, led, to, pressures, rivaling, natural, earthquakes, in, the, case, of, the, september, 12, 1973, test, a, seismic, magnitude, of, 6, 97, on, the, richter, scale, was, reached, setting, off, an, 80, million, ton, avalanche, that, blocked, two, glacial, streams, and, created, a, lake, 2, kilometres, 1, 2, mi, in, length, over, its, history, as, a, nuclear, test, site, novaya, zemlya, hosted, 224, nuclear, detonations, with, a, total, explosive, energy, equivalent, to, 265, megatons, of, tnt, for, comparison, all, explosives, used, in, world, war, ii, including, the, detonations, of, two, us, nuclear, bombs, amounted, to, only, two, megatons, in, 1988, 1989, glasnost, helped, make, the, novaya, zemlya, testing, activities, public, knowledge, and, in, 1990, greenpeace, activists, staged, a, protest, at, the, site, the, last, nuclear, test, explosion, was, in, 1990, also, the, last, for, the, entire, soviet, union, and, russia, the, ministry, for, atomic, energy, has, performed, a, series, of, subcritical, underwater, nuclear, experiments, near, matochkin, shar, each, autumn, since, 1998, these, tests, reportedly, involve, up, to, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, of, weapons, grade, plutonium, in, october, 2012, it, was, reported, that, russia, would, resume, subcritical, nuclear, testing, at, zone, b, in, spring, 2013, construction, of, what, would, become, a, new, tunnel, and, four, buildings, was, initiated, near, the, severny, settlement, 3, kilometres, 1, 9, mi, west, northwest, to, the, mount, lazarev, in, 2023, cnn, reported, that, commercial, satellite, imagery, showed, new, tunneling, activity, and, surface, construction, at, novaya, zemlya, test, sites, including, published, imagery, at, 73, 23, 06,

pierre, martin, de, la, martini, re, gave, a, description, of, the, indigenous, population, of, the, archipelago, whom, he, called, zembliens, from, nova, zembla, or, nouvelle, zemble, for, novaya, zemlya, he, noted, that, the, zembliens, worshipped, the, sun, and, wooden, idols, in, 1870s, several, nenets, families, were, resettled, from, elsewhere, as, part, of, the, colonization, of, the, territory, by, the, russian, empire, which, established, a, settlement, of, malye, karmakuly, the, indigenous, population, from, 1872, to, the, 1950s, consisted, of, about, 50, 300, nenets, who, subsisted, mainly, on, fishing, trapping, reindeer, herding, polar, bear, hunting, and, seal, hunting, natural, resources, include, copper, lead, and, zinc, the, entire, civilian, population, was, transferred, to, the, mainland, in, 1957, before, nuclear, testing, began, the, population, of, novaya, zemlya, as, of, the, 2010, census, was, about, 2, 429, of, whom, 1, 972, resided, in, belushya, guba, an, urban, settlement, that, is, the, administrative, center, of, novaya, zemlya, district, 457, more, persons, resided, in, the, second, largest, settlement, of, rogachevo, rogachevo, the, population, consists, mainly, of, military, and, construction, workers, novaya, zemlya, is, an, extension, of, the, northern, part, of, the, ural, mountains, and, the, interior, is, mountainous, throughout, it, is, separated, from, the, mainland, by, the, kara, strait, novaya, zemlya, consists, of, two, major, islands, separated, by, the, narrow, matochkin, strait, as, well, as, a, number, of, smaller, islands, the, two, main, islands, are, the, coast, of, novaya, zemlya, is, very, indented, and, it, is, the, area, with, the, largest, number, of, fjords, in, the, russian, federation, novaya, zemlya, separates, the, barents, sea, from, the, kara, sea, the, total, area, is, about, 83, 000, square, kilometers, 32, 000, sq, mi, the, highest, mountain, is, located, on, the, northern, island, and, is, 1, 547, meters, 5, 075, ft, high, compared, to, other, regions, that, were, under, large, ice, sheets, during, the, last, glacial, period, novaya, zemlya, shows, relatively, little, isostatic, rebound, possibly, this, is, indebted, to, a, counter, effect, created, by, the, growth, of, glaciers, during, the, last, few, thousand, years, the, geology, of, novaya, zemlya, is, dominated, by, a, large, anticlinal, structure, that, forms, an, extension, of, the, ural, mountains, the, geology, is, primarily, formed, of, paleozoic, sedimentary, rocks, including, both, carbonate, and, siliciclastic, rocks, spanning, the, cambrian, to, permian, ranging, from, deep, marine, turbidites, and, flysch, to, shallow, marine, and, terrestrial, sandstones, and, reef, limestones, small, areas, of, late, neoproterozoic, 600, mya, granite, and, associated, metasedimentary, rocks, are, also, exposed, the, ecology, of, novaya, zemlya, is, influenced, by, its, severe, climate, but, the, region, nevertheless, supports, a, diversity, of, biota, one, of, the, most, notable, species, present, is, the, polar, bear, whose, population, in, the, barents, sea, region, is, genetically, distinct, from, other, polar, bear, subpopulations, novaya, zemlya, has, a, maritime, influenced, variety, of, a, tundra, climate, k, ppen, et, due, to, some, effect, from, the, gulf, stream, and, its, offshore, position, winters, are, a, lot, less, severe, than, in, inland, areas, on, a, lot, lower, latitudes, in, siberia, but, instead, last, up, to, eight, months, a, year, the, milder, waters, to, its, west, delays, the, onset, of, sea, ice, and, causes, vast, seasonal, lag, in, shoulder, seasons, due, to, latitudinal, differences, the, temperatures, and, daylight, varies, quite, a, bit, throughout, the, archipelago, with, the, malye, karmakuly, station, being, located, in, the, southern, part, novaya, zemlya, is, cloudy, in, general, but, snowfall, and, rainfall, is, relatively, scarce, for, being, a, maritime, location, even, so, glaciers, dominate, the, northern, interior, and, there, is, strong, snow, accumulation, each, winter, due, to, the, length, of, the, season, polar, bears, enter, human, inhabited, areas, more, frequently, than, previously, which, has, been, attributed, to, climate, change, global, warming, reduces, sea, ice, forcing, the, bears, to, come, inland, to, find, food, in, february, 2019, a, mass, migration, occurred, in, the, northeastern, portion, of, novaya, zemlya, dozens, of, polar, bears, were, seen, entering, homes, public, buildings, and, inhabited, areas, so, arkhangelsk, region, authorities, declared, a, state, of, emergency, on, saturday, february, 16, 2019
