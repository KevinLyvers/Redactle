the, zagros, mountains, persian, romanized, kuh, h, ye, z, gros, arabic, romanized, jibal, zaghrus, kurdish, romanized, iyakan, zagros, turkish, zagros, da, lar, luri, k, ya, zagrus, or, are, a, long, mountain, range, in, iran, northern, iraq, and, southeastern, turkey, the, mountain, range, has, a, total, length, of, 1, 600, km, 990, mi, the, zagros, range, begins, in, northwestern, iran, and, roughly, follows, iran, s, western, border, while, covering, much, of, southeastern, turkey, and, northeastern, iraq, from, this, border, region, the, range, continues, southeast, to, the, waters, of, the, persian, gulf, it, spans, the, southern, parts, of, the, armenian, highlands, and, the, whole, length, of, the, western, and, southwestern, iranian, plateau, ending, at, the, strait, of, hormuz, the, highest, point, is, mount, dena, at, 4, 409, metres, 14, 465, ft, the, zagros, fold, and, thrust, belt, was, mainly, formed, by, the, collision, of, two, tectonic, plates, the, eurasian, plate, and, the, arabian, plate, this, collision, mainly, happened, during, the, miocene, about, 25, 5, mya, or, million, years, ago, and, folded, the, entirety, of, the, rocks, that, had, been, deposited, from, the, paleozoic, 541, 242, mya, to, the, cenozoic, 66, mya, present, in, the, passive, continental, margin, on, the, arabian, plate, however, the, obduction, of, neotethys, oceanic, crust, during, the, cretaceous, 145, 66, mya, and, the, continental, arc, collision, in, the, eocene, 56, 34, mya, both, had, major, effects, on, uplifts, in, the, northeastern, parts, of, the, belt, the, process, of, collision, continues, to, the, present, and, as, the, arabian, plate, is, being, pushed, against, the, eurasian, plate, the, zagros, mountains, and, the, iranian, plateau, are, getting, higher, and, higher, recent, gps, measurements, in, iran, have, shown, that, this, collision, is, still, active, and, the, resulting, deformation, is, distributed, non, uniformly, in, the, country, mainly, taken, up, in, the, major, mountain, belts, like, alborz, and, zagros, a, relatively, dense, gps, network, which, covered, the, iranian, zagros, also, proves, a, high, rate, of, deformation, within, the, zagros, the, gps, results, show, that, the, current, rate, of, shortening, in, the, southeast, zagros, is, 10, mm, a, 0, 39, in, year, dropping, to, 5, mm, a, 0, 20, in, year, in, the, northwest, zagros, the, north, south, kazerun, strike, slip, fault, divides, the, zagros, into, two, distinct, zones, of, deformation, the, gps, results, also, show, different, shortening, directions, along, the, belt, normal, shortening, in, the, southeast, and, oblique, shortening, in, the, northwest, zagros, the, zagros, mountains, were, created, around, the, time, of, the, second, ice, age, which, caused, the, tectonic, collision, leading, to, its, uniqueness, the, sedimentary, cover, in, the, se, zagros, is, deforming, above, a, layer, of, rock, salt, acting, as, a, ductile, decollement, with, a, low, basal, friction, whereas, in, the, nw, zagros, the, salt, layer, is, missing, or, is, very, thin, this, different, basal, friction, is, partly, responsible, for, the, different, topographies, on, either, side, of, the, kazerun, fault, higher, topography, and, narrower, zone, of, deformation, in, the, nw, zagros, is, observed, whereas, in, the, se, deformation, was, spread, more, and, a, wider, zone, of, deformation, with, lower, topography, was, formed, stresses, induced, in, the, earth, s, crust, by, the, collision, caused, extensive, folding, of, the, preexisting, layered, sedimentary, rocks, subsequent, erosion, removed, softer, rocks, such, as, mudstone, rock, formed, by, consolidated, mud, and, siltstone, a, slightly, coarser, grained, mudstone, while, leaving, harder, rocks, such, as, limestone, calcium, rich, rock, consisting, of, the, remains, of, marine, organisms, and, dolomite, rocks, similar, to, limestone, containing, calcium, and, magnesium, this, differential, erosion, formed, the, linear, ridges, of, the, zagros, mountains, the, depositional, environment, and, tectonic, history, of, the, rocks, were, conducive, to, the, formation, and, trapping, of, petroleum, and, the, zagros, region, is, an, important, area, for, oil, production, salt, domes, and, salt, glaciers, are, a, common, feature, of, the, zagros, mountains, salt, domes, are, an, important, target, for, petroleum, exploration, as, the, impermeable, salt, frequently, traps, petroleum, beneath, other, rock, layers, there, is, also, much, water, soluble, gypsum, in, the, region, the, mountains, are, completely, of, sedimentary, origin, and, are, made, primarily, of, limestone, in, the, elevated, zagros, or, the, higher, zagros, the, paleozoic, rocks, can, be, found, mainly, in, the, upper, and, higher, sections, of, the, peaks, of, the, zagros, mountains, along, the, zagros, main, fault, on, both, sides, of, this, fault, there, are, mesozoic, rocks, a, combination, of, triassic, 252, 201, mya, and, jurassic, 201, 145, mya, rocks, that, are, surrounded, by, cretaceous, rocks, on, both, sides, the, folded, zagros, the, mountains, south, of, the, elevated, zagros, and, almost, parallel, to, the, main, zagros, fault, is, formed, mainly, of, tertiary, rocks, with, the, paleogene, 66, 23, mya, rocks, south, of, the, cretaceous, rocks, and, then, the, neogene, 23, 2, 6, mya, rocks, south, of, the, paleogene, rocks, the, mountains, are, divided, into, many, parallel, sub, ranges, up, to, 10, or, 250, km, 6, 2, or, 155, 3, mi, wide, and, orogenically, have, the, same, age, as, the, alps, iran, s, main, oilfields, lie, in, the, western, central, foothills, of, the, zagros, mountain, range, the, southern, ranges, of, the, fars, province, have, somewhat, lower, summits, reaching, 4, 000, metres, 13, 000, feet, they, contain, some, limestone, rocks, showing, abundant, marine, fossils, the, peaks, that, are, at, least, 3800, meters, high, and, have, a, topographic, prominence, of, at, least, 300, meters, the, zagros, mountains, have, significant, ancient, history, they, were, occupied, by, early, humans, since, the, lower, paleolithic, period, the, earliest, human, fossils, discovered, in, zagros, belongs, to, neanderthals, and, come, from, shanidar, cave, bisitun, cave, and, wezmeh, cave, the, remains, of, ten, neanderthals, dating, from, around, 65, 000, 35, 000, years, ago, have, been, found, in, the, shanidar, cave, the, cave, also, contains, two, later, proto, neolithic, cemeteries, one, of, which, dates, back, about, 10, 600, years, and, contains, 35, individuals, evidence, from, later, upper, paleolithic, and, epipaleolithic, occupations, come, from, yafteh, cave, kaldar, cave, near, khoramabad, and, warwasi, malaverd, near, kermanshah, kenacheh, cave, in, kurdistan, boof, cave, in, fars, and, a, number, of, other, caves, and, rock, shelters, signs, of, early, agriculture, date, back, as, far, as, 9000, bc, in, the, foothills, of, the, mountains, some, settlements, later, grew, into, cities, eventually, named, anshan, and, susa, jarmo, is, one, archaeological, site, in, this, area, some, of, the, earliest, evidence, of, wine, production, has, been, discovered, in, the, mountains, both, the, settlements, of, hajji, firuz, tepe, and, godin, tepe, have, given, evidence, of, wine, storage, dating, between, 3500, and, 5400, bc, a, human, metatarsal, bone, fragment, from, wezmeh, cave, has, been, analyzed, and, dated, to, the, neolithic, period, the, dna, from, this, bone, fragment, shows, that, it, is, from, a, distinct, genetic, group, which, was, not, known, to, scientists, before, he, belongs, to, the, y, dna, haplogroup, g2b, specifically, its, branch, g, y37100, and, mitochondrial, haplogroup, j1d6, he, had, brown, eyes, relatively, dark, skin, and, black, hair, although, neolithic, iranians, carried, reduced, pigmentation, associated, alleles, in, several, genes, and, derived, alleles, at, 7, of, the, 12, loci, showing, the, strongest, signatures, of, selection, in, ancient, eurasians, he, did, not, contribute, to, the, genetic, makeup, of, early, european, farmers, or, modern, europeans, instead, he, was, the, most, genetically, similar, to, modern, iranian, zoroastrians, followed, by, fars, balochi, brahui, kalash, and, georgians, gallego, llorente, et, al, 2016, believes, that, the, zagros, mountain, was, a, plausible, source, of, eurasian, ancestry, in, central, and, south, asia, along, with, kotias, which, was, inhabited, by, caucasu, hunter, gatherers, he, cites, archaeological, evidence, of, eastward, neolithic, expansions, from, the, near, east, during, early, ancient, times, the, zagros, was, the, home, of, peoples, such, as, the, hurrians, guti, kassites, elamites, and, mitanni, who, periodically, invaded, the, sumerian, and, or, akkadian, cities, of, mesopotamia, the, mountains, create, a, geographic, barrier, between, the, mesopotamian, plain, which, is, in, iraq, and, the, iranian, plateau, a, small, archive, of, clay, tablets, detailing, the, complex, interactions, of, these, groups, in, the, early, second, millennium, bc, has, been, found, at, tell, shemshara, along, the, little, zab, tell, bazmusian, near, shemshara, was, occupied, between, 5000, bce, and, 800, ce, although, not, continuously, the, zagros, mountains, have, been, inhabited, by, different, groups, of, pastoralists, and, farmers, for, thousands, of, years, pastoralist, groups, such, as, lurs, bakhtiari, lurs, kurds, or, qashqais, move, from, their, herds, from, the, east, slopes, in, summer, yeyl, gh, to, the, west, slopes, in, winter, gheshl, gh, some, major, cities, are, located, on, the, foothills, of, the, zagros, mountains, including, sulaymaniyah, kermanshah, khorramabad, and, shiraz, the, lurs, are, an, iranic, tribe, primarily, inhabiting, the, central, western, and, southern, zagros, cities, inhibited, by, lurs, include, khorramabad, borujerd, malayer, izeh, shahr, e, kord, yasuj, lurs, speak, luri, and, span, across, many, provinces, in, iran, including, lorestan, khuzestan, chaharmahal,

by, bakhtiaris, include, masjed, soleyman, izeh, and, shahr, e, kord, a, significant, number, of, bakhtiari, still, practice, nomadic, pastoralism, kurds, are, aborigines, from, the, northwestern, and, the, eastern, zagros, taurus, mountain, ranges, which, spans, southeastern, turkey, northwestern, iran, northern, iraq, and, northern, syria, the, high, altitude, of, the, zagros, mountains, produces, a, series, of, choke, points, and, valleys, perfect, for, agriculture, and, human, development, it, has, also, long, defended, the, kurds, in, times, of, war, by, acting, as, a, natural, barrier, qashqai, people, are, a, tribal, confederation, in, iran, mostly, of, turkic, origin, significant, populations, can, be, found, in, central, and, south, zagros, especially, around, the, city, of, shiraz, in, the, fars, province, the, mountains, contain, several, ecosystems, prominent, among, them, are, the, forest, and, forest, steppe, areas, with, a, semi, arid, climate, as, defined, by,
