cape, horn, spanish, cabo, de, hornos, pronounced, is, the, southernmost, headland, of, the, tierra, del, fuego, archipelago, of, southern, chile, and, is, located, on, the, small, hornos, island, although, not, the, most, southerly, point, of, south, america, which, is, guila, islet, cape, horn, marks, the, northern, boundary, of, the, drake, passage, and, marks, where, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, meet, cape, horn, was, identified, by, mariners, and, first, rounded, in, 1616, by, the, dutchmen, willem, schouten, and, jacob, le, maire, who, named, it, kaap, hoorn, after, the, city, of, hoorn, in, the, netherlands, for, decades, cape, horn, was, a, major, milestone, on, the, clipper, route, by, which, sailing, ships, carried, trade, around, the, world, the, waters, around, cape, horn, are, particularly, hazardous, owing, to, strong, winds, large, waves, strong, currents, and, icebergs, the, need, for, boats, and, ships, to, round, cape, horn, was, greatly, reduced, by, the, opening, of, the, panama, canal, in, august, 1914, sailing, around, cape, horn, is, still, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, major, challenges, in, yachting, thus, a, few, recreational, sailors, continue, to, sail, this, route, sometimes, as, part, of, a, circumnavigation, of, the, globe, almost, all, of, these, choose, routes, through, the, channels, to, the, north, of, the, cape, many, take, a, detour, through, the, islands, and, anchor, to, wait, for, fair, weather, to, visit, horn, island, or, sail, around, it, to, replicate, a, rounding, of, this, historic, point, several, prominent, ocean, yacht, races, notably, the, volvo, ocean, race, velux, 5, oceans, race, and, the, solo, vend, e, globe, and, golden, globe, race, sail, around, the, world, via, the, horn, speed, records, for, round, the, world, sailing, are, recognized, for, following, this, route, cape, horn, is, located, on, hornos, island, in, the, hermite, islands, group, at, the, southern, end, of, the, tierra, del, fuego, archipelago, it, marks, the, north, edge, of, the, drake, passage, the, strait, between, south, america, and, antarctica, it, is, located, in, cabo, de, hornos, national, park, the, cape, lies, within, chilean, territorial, waters, and, the, chilean, navy, maintains, a, station, on, hoorn, island, consisting, of, a, residence, utility, building, chapel, and, lighthouse, a, short, distance, from, the, main, station, is, a, memorial, including, a, large, sculpture, made, by, chilean, sculptor, jos, balcells, featuring, the, silhouette, of, an, albatross, in, remembrance, of, the, sailors, who, died, while, attempting, to, round, the, horn, it, was, erected, in, 1992, through, the, initiative, of, the, chilean, section, of, the, cape, horn, captains, brotherhood, due, to, severe, winds, characteristic, of, the, region, the, sculpture, was, blown, over, in, 2014, a, 2019, research, expedition, found, the, world, s, southernmost, tree, growing, a, magellan, s, beech, mostly, bent, to, the, ground, on, a, northeast, facing, slope, at, the, island, s, southeast, corner, cape, horn, is, the, southern, limit, of, the, range, of, the, magellanic, penguin, the, climate, in, the, region, is, generally, cool, owing, to, the, southern, latitude, there, are, no, weather, stations, in, the, group, of, islands, including, cape, horn, but, a, study, in, 1882, 1883, found, an, annual, rainfall, of, 1, 357, millimetres, 53, 4, inches, with, an, average, annual, temperature, of, 5, 2, c, 41, 4, f, winds, were, reported, to, average, 30, kilometres, per, hour, 8, 33, m, s, 18, 64, mph, 5, bf, with, squalls, of, over, 100, kilometres, per, hour, 27, 78, m, s, 62, 14, mph, 10, bf, occurring, in, all, seasons, there, are, 278, days, of, rainfall, 70, days, snow, and, 2, 000, millimetres, 79, inches, of, annual, rainfall, cloud, coverage, is, generally, extensive, with, averages, from, 5, 2, eighths, in, may, and, july, to, 6, 4, eighths, in, december, and, january, precipitation, is, high, throughout, the, year, the, weather, station, on, the, nearby, diego, ram, rez, islands, 109, kilometres, 68, miles, south, west, in, the, sea, of, hoces, shows, the, greatest, rainfall, in, march, averaging, 137, 4, millimetres, 5, 41, in, while, october, which, has, the, least, rainfall, still, averages, 93, 7, millimetres, 3, 69, in, wind, conditions, are, generally, severe, particularly, in, winter, in, summer, the, wind, at, cape, horn, is, gale, force, up, to, 5, percent, of, the, time, with, generally, good, visibility, however, in, winter, gale, force, winds, occur, up, to, 30, percent, of, the, time, often, with, poor, visibility, many, stories, are, told, of, hazardous, journeys, around, the, horn, most, describing, fierce, storms, charles, darwin, wrote, one, sight, of, such, a, coast, is, enough, to, make, a, landsman, dream, for, a, week, about, shipwrecks, peril, and, death, being, the, southernmost, point, of, land, outside, of, antarctica, the, region, experiences, barely, 7, hours, of, daylight, during, the, june, solstice, with, cape, horn, itself, having, 6, hours, and, 57, minutes, the, region, experiences, around, 17, 1, 2, hours, of, daylight, during, the, december, solstice, and, experiences, only, nautical, twilight, from, civil, dusk, to, civil, dawn, white, nights, occur, during, the, week, around, the, december, solstice, cape, horn, yields, a, subpolar, oceanic, climate, cfc, with, abundant, precipitation, much, of, which, falls, as, sleet, and, snow, cape, horn, is, part, of, the, commune, of, cabo, de, hornos, whose, capital, is, puerto, williams, this, in, turn, is, part, of, ant, rtica, chilena, province, whose, capital, is, also, puerto, williams, the, area, is, part, of, the, magallanes, y, la, ant, rtica, chilena, region, of, chile, puerto, toro, a, few, miles, south, of, puerto, williams, is, the, closest, town, to, the, cape, many, modern, tankers, are, too, wide, to, fit, through, the, panama, canal, as, are, a, few, passenger, ships, and, several, aircraft, carriers, but, there, are, no, regular, commercial, routes, around, the, horn, and, modern, ships, carrying, cargo, are, rarely, seen, however, a, number, of, cruise, ships, routinely, round, the, horn, when, traveling, from, one, ocean, to, the, other, these, often, stop, in, ushuaia, or, punta, arenas, as, well, as, port, stanley, some, of, the, small, passenger, vessels, shuttling, between, ushuaia, and, the, antarctic, peninsula, will, pass, the, horn, too, time, and, weather, permitting, a, number, of, potential, sailing, routes, may, be, followed, around, the, tip, of, south, america, the, strait, of, magellan, between, the, mainland, and, tierra, del, fuego, is, a, major, although, narrow, passage, which, was, in, use, for, trade, well, before, the, horn, was, discovered, the, beagle, channel, named, for, the, ship, of, charles, darwin, s, expedition, between, tierra, del, fuego, and, isla, navarino, offers, a, potential, though, difficult, route, other, passages, may, be, taken, around, the, wollaston, and, hermite, islands, to, the, north, of, cape, horn, all, of, these, however, are, notorious, for, treacherous, williwaw, winds, which, can, strike, a, vessel, with, little, or, no, warning, given, the, narrowness, of, these, routes, vessels, have, a, significant, risk, of, being, driven, onto, the, rocks, the, open, waters, of, the, drake, passage, south, of, cape, horn, provide, by, far, the, widest, route, at, about, 800, kilometres, 500, miles, wide, this, passage, offers, ample, sea, room, for, maneuvering, as, winds, change, and, is, the, route, used, by, most, ships, and, sailboats, despite, the, possibility, of, extreme, wave, conditions, rounding, cape, horn, can, be, done, on, a, day, trip, by, helicopter, or, more, arduously, by, charter, power, boat, or, sailboat, or, by, cruise, ship, doubling, the, horn, is, traditionally, understood, to, involve, sailing, from, a, point, above, 50, degrees, south, in, the, pacific, around, the, horn, to, a, point, above, 50, degrees, south, in, the, atlantic, and, then, sailing, back, against, the, prevailing, westerly, winds, to, a, point, above, the, 50th, parallel, south, again, back, in, the, pacific, a, considerably, more, difficult, and, time, consuming, endeavor, having, a, minimum, length, of, 930, miles, 1, 500, km, for, each, leg, the, 50th, parallel, south, on, both, coasts, of, south, america, represent, a, set, of, benchmark, latitudes, of, a, horn, run, and, is, a, region, of, the, ocean, that, according, to, herman, melville, takes, the, conceit, out, of, fresh, water, sailors, and, steeps, in, a, still, saltier, brine, the, saltiest, several, factors, combine, to, make, the, passage, around, cape, horn, one, of, the, most, hazardous, shipping, routes, in, the, world, the, fierce, sailing, conditions, prevalent, in, the, southern, ocean, generally, the, geography, of, the, passage, south, of, the, horn, and, the, extreme, southern, latitude, of, the, horn, at, 56, south, for, comparison, cape, agulhas, at, the, southern, tip, of, africa, is, at, 35, south, stewart, island, rakiura, at, the, south, end, of, new, zealand, is, 47, south, edinburgh, 56, north, the, prevailing, winds, in, latitudes, below, 40, south, can, blow, from, west, to, east, around, the, world, almost, uninterrupted, by, land, giving, rise, to, the, roaring, forties, and, the, even, more, wild, furious, fifties, and, screaming, sixties, these, winds, are, hazardous, enough, that, ships, traveling, east, would, tend, to, stay, in, the, northern, part, of, the, forties, i, e, not, far, below, 40, south, latitude, however, rounding, cape, horn, requires, ships, to, press, south, to, 56, south, latitude, well, into, the, zone, of, fiercest, winds, these, winds, are, exacerbated, at, the, horn, by, the, funneling, effect, of, the, andes, and, the, antarctic, peninsula, which, channel, the, winds, into, the, relatively, narrow, drake, passage, the, strong, winds, of, the, southern, ocean, give, rise, to, correspondingly, large, waves, these, waves, can, attain, great, height, as, they, roll, around, the, southern, ocean, free, of, any, interruption, from, land, south, of, the, horn, however, these, waves, encounter, an, area, of, shallow, water, which, has, the, effect, of, making, the, waves, shorter, and, steeper, greatly, increasing, the, hazard, to, ships, if, the, strong, eastward, current, through, the, drake, passage, encounters, an, opposing, westerly, wind, this, can, have, the, effect, of, further, building, up, the, waves, in, addition, to, these, normal, waves, the, area, west, of, the, horn, is, particularly, notorious, for, rogue, waves, which, can, attain, heights, of, up, to, 30, metres, 98, feet, the, prevailing, winds, and, currents, create, particular, problems, for, vessels, trying, to, round, the, horn, against, them, i, e, from, east, to, west, this, was, a, particularly, serious, problem, for, traditional, sailing, ships, which, could, make, very, little, headway, against, the, wind, at, the, best, of, times, modern, sailing, boats, are, significantly, more, efficient, to, windward, and, can, more, reliably, make, a, westward, passage, of, the, horn, as, they, do, in, the, global, challenge, race, ice, is, a, hazard, to, sailors, venturing, far, below, 40, south, although, the, ice, limit, dips, south, around, the, horn, icebergs, are, a, significant, hazard, for, vessels, in, the, area, in, the, south, pacific, in, february, summer, in, southern, hemisphere, icebergs, are, generally, confined, to, below, 50, south, but, in, august, the, iceberg, hazard, can, extend, north, of, 40, south, even, in, february, the, horn, is, well, below, the, latitude, of, the, iceberg, limit, these, hazards, have, made, the, horn, notorious, as, perhaps, the, most, dangerous, ship, passage, in, the, world, many, ships, have, been, wrecked, and, many, sailors, have, died, attempting, to, round, the, cape, download, coordinates, as, two, lighthouses, are, located, near, or, in, cape, horn, the, one, located, in, the, chilean, navy, station, is, the, more, accessible, and, visited, and, is, commonly, referred, to, as, the, cape, horn, lighthouse, however, the, chilean, navy, station, including, the, lighthouse, arls, chi, 030, 55, 57, 49, s, 67, 13, 14, w, 55, 96361, s, 67, 22056, w, 55, 96361, 67, 22056, chi, 030, and, the, memorial, are, not, located, on, cape, horn, which, is, difficult, to, access, either, by, land, or, sea, but, on, another, land, point, about, one, mile, east, northeast, on, cape, horn, proper, is, a, smaller, 4, metre, 13, foot, fiberglass, light, tower, with, a, focal, plane, of, 40, metres, 130, feet, and, a, range, of, about, 21, kilometres, 13, miles, this, is, the, authentic, cape, horn, lighthouse, arls, chi, 006, 55, 58, 38, s,

farther, south, including, one, in, the, diego, ram, rez, islands, and, several, in, antarctica, despite, the, opening, of, the, suez, and, panama, canals, the, horn, remains, part, of, the, fastest, sailing, route, around, the, world, and, so, the, growth, in, recreational, long, distance, sailing, has, brought, about, a, revival, of, sailing, via, the, horn, owing, to, the, remoteness, of, the, location, and, the, hazards, there, a, rounding, of, cape, horn, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, yachting, equivalent, of, climbing, mount, everest, and, so, many, sailors, seek, it, for, its, own, sake, joshua, slocum, was, the, first, single, handed, yachtsman, to, successfully, pass, this, way, in, 1895, although, in, the, end, extreme, weather, forced, him, to, use, some, of, the, inshore, routes, between, the, channels, and, islands, and, it, is, believed, he, did, not, actually, pass, outside, the, horn, proper, if, one, had, to, go, by, strict, definitions, the, first, small, boat, to, sail, around, outside, cape, horn, was, the, irish, 42, foot, 13, metre, yacht, saoirse, sailed, by, conor, o, brien, with, three, friends, who, rounded, it, during, a, circumnavigation, of, the, world, between, 1923, and, 1925, in, 1934, the, norwegian, al, hansen, was, the, first, to, round, cape, horn, single, handed, from, east, to, west, the, wrong, way, in, his, boat, mary, jane, but, was, subsequently, wrecked, on, the, coast, of, chile, the, first, person, to, successfully, circumnavigate, the, world, single, handed, via, cape, horn, was, argentinian, vito, dumas, who, made, the, voyage, in, 1942, in, his, 33, foot, 10, metre, ketch, lehg, ii, a, number, of, other, sailors, have, since, followed, him, including, webb, chiles, aboard, egregious, who, in, december, 1975, rounded, cape, horn, single, handed, on, march, 31, 2010, 16, year, old, abby, sunderland, became, the, youngest, person, to, single, handedly, sail, around, cape, horn, in, her, attempt, to, circumnavigate, the, globe, in, 1987, the, british, cape, horn, expedition, headed, by, nigel, h, seymour, rounded, cape, horn, in, the, world, s, first, ever, sailing, kayaks, called, kaymaran, two, seagoing, kayaks, which, could, link, together, with, two, sails, mountable, in, any, of, the, four, sailing, positions, between, the, two, kayaks, today, there, are, several, major, yacht, races, held, regularly, along, the, old, clipper, route, via, cape, horn, the, first, of, these, was, the, sunday, times, golden, globe, race, which, was, a, single, handed, race, this, inspired, the, present, day, around, alone, race, which, circumnavigates, with, stops, and, the, vend, e, globe, which, is, non, stop, both, of, these, are, single, handed, races, and, are, held, every, four, years, the, volvo, ocean, race, is, a, crewed, race, with, stops, which, sails, the, clipper, route, every, four, years, its, origins, lie, in, the, whitbread, round, the, world, race, first, competed, in, 1973, 74, the, jules, verne, trophy, is, a, prize, for, the, fastest, circumnavigation, of, the, world, by, any, type, of, yacht, with, no, restrictions, on, the, size, of, the, crew, no, assistance, non, stop, finally, the, global, challenge, race, goes, around, the, world, the, wrong, way, from, east, to, west, which, involves, rounding, cape, horn, against, the, prevailing, winds, and, currents, the, horn, remains, a, major, hazard, for, recreational, sailors, however, a, classic, case, is, that, of, miles, and, beryl, smeeton, who, attempted, to, round, the, horn, in, their, yacht, tzu, hang, hit, by, a, rogue, wave, when, approaching, the, horn, the, boat, pitchpoled, i, e, somersaulted, end, over, end, they, survived, and, were, able, to, make, repairs, in, talcahuano, chile, and, later, attempted, the, passage, again, only, to, be, rolled, over, and, dismasted, for, a, second, time, by, another, rogue, wave, which, again, they, miraculously, survived, in, 1526, the, spanish, vessel, the, san, lesmes, commanded, by, francisco, de, hoces, member, of, the, loa, sa, expedition, was, blown, south, by, a, gale, in, front, of, the, atlantic, end, of, magellan, strait, and, reached, cape, horn, passing, through, 56, s, where, they, thought, to, see, land, s, end, since, the, discovery, the, sea, separating, south, america, from, antarctica, bears, the, name, of, its, discoverer, in, spanish, sources, it, appears, as, mar, de, hoces, sea, of, hoces, in, most, spanish, language, maps, in, english, charts, however, it, is, named, the, drake, passage, in, september, 1578, sir, francis, drake, in, the, course, of, his, circumnavigation, of, the, world, passed, through, the, strait, of, magellan, into, the, pacific, ocean, before, he, could, continue, his, voyage, north, his, ships, encountered, a, storm, and, were, blown, well, to, the, south, of, tierra, del, fuego, the, expanse, of, open, water, they, encountered, led, drake, to, guess, that, far, from, being, another, continent, as, previously, believed, tierra, del, fuego, was, an, island, with, open, sea, to, its, south, this, discovery, went, unused, for, some, time, as, ships, continued, to, use, the, known, passage, through, the, strait, of, magellan, by, the, early, 17th, century, the, dutch, east, india, company, was, given, a, monopoly, on, all, dutch, trade, via, the, straits, of, magellan, and, the, cape, of, good, hope, the, only, known, sea, routes, at, the, time, to, the, far, east, to, search, for, an, alternate, route, and, one, to, the, unknown, terra, australis, isaac, le, maire, a, wealthy, amsterdam, merchant, and, willem, schouten, a, ship, s, master, of, hoorn, contributed, in, equal, shares, to, the, enterprise, with, additional, financial, support, from, merchants, of, hoorn, jacob, le, maire, isaac, s, son, went, on, the, journey, as, chiefe, marchant, and, principall, factor, in, charge, of, trading, aspects, of, the, endeavour, the, two, ships, that, departed, holland, at, the, beginning, of, june, 1615, were, the, eendracht, of, 360, tons, with, schouten, and, le, maire, aboard, and, the, hoorn, of, 110, tons, of, which, schouten, s, brother, johan, was, master, it, was, eendracht, then, with, the, crew, of, the, recently, wrecked, hoorn, aboard, that, passed, through, the, le, maire, strait, and, schouten, and, le, maire, made, their, great, discovery, at, the, time, it, was, discovered, the, horn, was, believed, to, be, the, southernmost, point, of, tierra, del, fuego, the, unpredictable, violence, of, weather, and, sea, conditions, in, the, drake, passage, made, exploration, difficult, and, it, was, only, in, 1624, that, the, horn, was, discovered, to, be, an, island, it, is, a, telling, testament, to, the, difficulty, of, conditions, there, that, antarctica, only, 650, kilometres, 400, miles, away, across, the, drake, passage, was, discovered, only, as, recently, as, 1820, despite, the, passage, having, been, used, as, a, major, shipping, route, for, 200, years, from, the, 18th, to, the, early, 20th, centuries, cape, horn, was, a, part, of, the, clipper, routes, which, carried, much, of, the, world, s, trade, sailing, ships, sailed, round, the, horn, carrying, wool, grain, and, gold, from, australia, back, to, europe, these, included, the, windjammers, in, the, heyday, of, the, great, grain, race, of, the, 1930s, much, trade, was, carried, around, the, horn, between, europe, and, the, far, east, and, trade, and, passenger, ships, travelled, between, the, coasts, of, the, united, states, via, the, horn, the, horn, exacted, a, heavy, toll, from, shipping, however, owing, to, the, extremely, hazardous, combination, of, conditions, there, the, only, facilities, in, the, vicinity, able, to, service, or, supply, a, ship, or, provide, medical, care, were, in, the, falkland, islands, the, businesses, there, were, so, notorious, for, price, gouging, that, damaged, ships, were, sometimes, abandoned, at, port, stanley, while, most, companies, switched, to, steamers, and, later, used, the, panama, canal, german, steel, hulled, sailing, ships, like, the, flying, p, liners, were, designed, since, the, 1890s, to, withstand, the, weather, conditions, around, the, horn, as, they, specialized, in, the, south, american, nitrate, trade, and, later, the, australian, grain, trade, none, of, them, were, lost, travelling, around, the, horn, but, some, like, the, mighty, preu, en, were, victims, of, collisions, in, the, busy, english, channel, traditionally, a, sailor, who, had, rounded, the, horn, was, entitled, to, wear, a, gold, loop, earring, in, the, left, ear, the, one, which, had, faced, the, horn, in, a, typical, eastbound, passage, and, to, dine, with, one, foot, on, the, table, a, sailor, who, had, also, rounded, the, cape, of, good, hope, could, place, both, feet, on, the, table, one, particular, historic, attempt, to, round, the, horn, that, of, hms, bounty, in, 1788, has, been, immortalized, in, history, due, to, the, subsequent, mutiny, on, the, bounty, this, abortive, horn, voyage, has, been, portrayed, with, varying, historical, accuracy, in, three, major, motion, pictures, about, captain, william, bligh, s, mission, to, transport, breadfruit, plants, from, tahiti, to, jamaica, the, bounty, made, only, 85, miles, of, headway, in, 31, days, of, east, to, west, sailing, before, giving, up, by, reversing, course, and, going, around, africa, although, the, 1984, movie, portrayed, another, decision, to, go, round, the, horn, as, a, precipitating, factor, in, the, mutiny, this, time, west, to, east, after, collecting, the, breadfruits, in, the, south, pacific, in, fact, that, was, never, contemplated, out, of, concern, for, the, effect, of, the, low, temperatures, near, the, horn, on, the, plants, the, transcontinental, railroads, in, north, america, as, well, as, the, panama, canal, that, opened, in, 1914, in, central, america, led, to, the, gradual, decrease, in, use, of, the, horn, for, trade, as, steamships, replaced, sailing, ships, flying, p, liner, pamir, became, the, last, commercial, sailing, ship, to, round, cape, horn, laden, with, cargo, carrying, grain, from, port, victoria, australia, to, falmouth, england, in, 1949, cape, horn, has, been, an, icon, of, sailing, culture, for, centuries, it, has, featured, in, sea, shanties, and, in, many, books, about, sailing, one, of, the, classic, accounts, of, a, working, ship, in, the, age, of, sail, is, two, years, before, the, mast, by, richard, henry, dana, jr, in, which, the, author, describes, an, arduous, trip, from, boston, to, california, via, cape, horn, just, before, eight, o, clock, then, about, sundown, in, that,
