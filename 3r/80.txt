the, beaufort, sea, b, o, f, r, t, french, mer, de, beaufort, is, a, marginal, sea, of, the, arctic, ocean, located, north, of, the, northwest, territories, yukon, and, alaska, and, west, of, the, canadian, arctic, archipelago, the, sea, is, named, after, sir, francis, beaufort, a, hydrographer, the, mackenzie, river, the, longest, in, canada, empties, into, the, canadian, part, of, the, beaufort, sea, west, of, tuktoyaktuk, which, is, one, of, the, few, permanent, settlements, on, the, sea, s, shores, the, sea, characterized, by, severe, climate, is, frozen, over, most, of, the, year, historically, only, a, narrow, pass, up, to, 100, km, 62, mi, opened, in, august, september, near, its, shores, but, recently, due, to, climate, change, in, the, arctic, the, ice, free, area, in, late, summer, has, greatly, enlarged, until, recently, the, beaufort, sea, was, known, as, an, important, reservoir, for, the, replenishment, of, arctic, sea, ice, sea, ice, would, often, rotate, for, several, years, in, the, beaufort, gyre, the, dominant, ocean, current, of, the, beaufort, sea, growing, into, sturdy, and, thick, multi, year, ice, claims, that, the, seacoast, was, populated, about, 30, 000, years, ago, have, been, largely, discredited, see, below, present, population, density, is, very, low, the, sea, contains, significant, resources, of, petroleum, and, natural, gas, under, its, shelf, such, as, the, amauligak, field, they, were, discovered, in, the, period, between, the, 1950s, and, 1980s, and, since, the, latter, part, of, that, period, their, exploration, has, become, the, major, human, activity, in, the, area, the, traditional, occupations, of, fishing, and, whale, and, seal, hunting, are, practiced, only, locally, and, have, no, commercial, significance, as, a, result, the, sea, hosts, one, of, the, largest, colonies, of, beluga, whales, and, there, is, no, sign, of, overfishing, as, of, now, to, prevent, overfishing, in, its, waters, the, us, adopted, a, precautionary, commercial, fisheries, management, plan, in, august, 2009, in, april, 2011, the, canadian, government, signed, a, memorandum, of, understanding, with, the, inuvialuit, as, a, first, step, in, developing, a, larger, ocean, management, plan, the, canadian, government, announced, in, october, 2014, that, no, new, commercial, fisheries, in, the, beaufort, sea, will, be, considered, until, research, has, shown, sustainable, stocks, that, would, be, made, available, to, inuvialuit, first, the, canadian, government, designated, blocks, of, the, beaufort, sea, as, marine, protected, areas, mpas, the, anguniaqvia, niqiqyuam, mpa, surrounds, the, parry, peninsula, in, the, amundsen, gulf, and, the, tarium, niryutait, mpa, is, located, at, the, mackenzie, river, delta, and, estuary, the, protected, areas, are, set, to, protect, species, and, habitats, for, the, inuvialuit, community, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, beaufort, sea, as, follows, on, the, north, a, line, from, point, barrow, alaska, to, lands, end, prince, patrick, island, 76, 16, n, 124, 08, w, 76, 267, n, 124, 133, w, 76, 267, 124, 133, on, the, east, from, lands, end, through, the, southwest, coast, of, prince, patrick, island, to, griffiths, point, thence, a, line, to, cape, prince, alfred, the, northwestern, extreme, of, banks, island, through, its, west, coast, to, cape, kellet, the, southwestern, point, and, thence, a, line, to, cape, bathurst, on, the, mainland, 70, 36, n, 127, 32, w, 70, 600, n, 127, 533, w, 70, 600, 127, 533, there, is, an, unresolved, dispute, involving, a, wedge, shaped, slice, on, the, international, boundary, in, the, beaufort, sea, between, the, canadian, territory, of, yukon, and, the, u, s, state, of, alaska, canada, claims, the, maritime, boundary, to, be, along, the, 141st, meridian, west, out, to, a, distance, of, 200, nmi, 370, km, 230, mi, following, the, alaska, yukon, land, border, this, follows, the, natural, prolongation, principle, which, holds, that, a, nation, s, maritime, boundary, should, reflect, the, natural, prolongation, of, where, its, land, territory, reaches, the, coast, the, position, of, the, united, states, is, that, the, boundary, line, should, be, perpendicular, to, the, coast, out, to, a, distance, of, 200, nmi, 370, km, 230, mi, following, a, line, of, equidistance, from, the, coast, the, equidistance, principle, argues, that, a, nation, s, maritime, boundaries, should, conform, to, a, median, line, that, is, equidistant, from, the, shores, of, neighbouring, nations, this, difference, creates, a, wedge, with, an, area, of, about, 21, 000, km, 2, 8, 100, sq, mi, that, is, claimed, by, both, nations, canada, s, position, has, its, roots, in, the, treaty, of, saint, petersburg, 1825, between, the, united, kingdom, and, the, russian, empire, that, set, the, boundary, between, the, two, canada, is, the, successor, state, to, great, britain, in, relation, to, this, treaty, which, stipulates, the, line, of, demarcation, shall, follow, the, summit, of, the, mountains, situated, parallel, to, the, coast, as, far, as, the, point, of, intersection, of, the, 141st, degree, of, west, longitude, and, finally, from, the, said, point, of, intersection, the, said, meridian, line, of, the, 141st, degree, in, its, prolongation, as, far, as, the, frozen, ocean, canada, maintains, that, this, treaty, is, extensible, from, the, land, into, the, beaufort, sea, along, the, meridian, the, united, states, rejects, this, extension, and, instead, asserts, a, boundary, line, based, upon, equidistance, although, its, position, is, somewhat, undermined, by, its, acceptance, in, 1867, of, similar, treaty, wording, and, a, similar, interpretation, under, the, treaty, whereby, it, acquired, alaska, both, the, u, s, and, canada, agree, that, they, are, bound, by, the, 1958, convention, on, the, continental, shelf, and, they, both, agree, that, the, boundary, should, be, equitable, as, determined, by, the, international, court, of, justice, they, differ, on, what, should, be, deemed, equitable, the, u, s, contends, that, equidistance, is, an, appropriate, principle, for, determining, a, maritime, boundary, where, there, are, no, special, circumstances, in, the, area, and, when, equidistance, results, in, a, boundary, in, accordance, with, equitable, principles, canada, contends, that, an, equidistance, principle, does, not, result, in, an, equitable, boundary, because, distortion, would, occur, the, coast, of, yukon, is, concave, whereas, the, coast, of, alaska, is, convex, and, thus, an, equidistance, principle, would, result, in, a, significant, extension, of, the, u, s, possession, this, dispute, has, taken, on, increased, significance, due, to, the, possible, presence, of, natural, reserves, within, the, wedge, which, according, to, canada, s, national, energy, board, may, contain, 1, 700, 000, 000, m, 3, 6, 0, 10, 10, cu, ft, of, gas, which, would, cover, the, national, consumption, for, 20, years, and, more, than, 1, 000, 000, 000, m, 3, 3, 5, 10, 10, cu, ft, of, oil, because, of, this, canada, argues, that, special, circumstances, apply, to, this, border, a, position, that, the, u, s, rejects, this, dispute, is, in, this, respect, a, mirror, image, of, the, dispute, between, the, u, s, and, canada, over, the, gulf, of, maine, where, the, u, s, argued, for, special, circumstances, and, canada, argued, for, the, equidistance, principle, in, that, latter, dispute, both, of, those, arguments, were, rejected, and, the, border, was, drawn, based, upon, geometric, principles, taking, into, account, geographic, factors, neither, the, u, s, nor, canada, has, pressed, for, a, swift, resolution, for, the, matter, or, arbitration, at, the, international, court, of, justice, however, and, the, two, have, in, the, meantime, cooperated, in, several, measures, aimed, at, preserving, the, maritime, environment, before, the, end, of, 2004, the, us, leased, eight, plots, of, land, below, the, water, for, oil, exploration, and, exploitation, provoking, a, diplomatic, protest, from, canada, on, 20, august, 2009, united, states, secretary, of, commerce, gary, locke, announced, a, moratorium, on, commercial, fishing, of, the, beaufort, sea, north, of, alaska, including, the, disputed, waters, in, july, 2010, us, canada, negotiations, have, started, in, ottawa, with, the, next, meeting, planned, in, 2011, a, joint, geological, survey, of, the, area, has, been, initiated, and, the, issue, was, marked, as, settled, by, the, cia, world, factbook, though, no, official, document, has, been, released, by, september, 2010, on, august, 20, 2009, united, states, secretary, of, commerce, gary, locke, announced, a, moratorium, on, fishing, the, beaufort, sea, north, of, alaska, according, to, locke, as, arctic, sea, ice, recedes, due, to, climate, change, there, is, increasing, interest, in, commercial, fishing, in, arctic, waters, we, are, in, a, position, to, plan, for, sustainable, fishing, that, does, not, damage, the, overall, health, of, this, fragile, ecosystem, this, plan, takes, a, precautionary, approach, to, any, development, of, commercial, fishing, in, an, area, where, there, has, been, none, in, the, past, there, is, no, widespread, commercial, fisheries, in, those, waters, now, the, moratorium, was, imposed, in, anticipation, that, global, warming, would, make, those, waters, accessible, to, commercial, fisheries, the, moratorium, stirred, controversy, in, canada, because, the, region, where, the, usa, announced, the, moratorium, included, a, large, wedge, shaped, region, of, disputed, waters, randy, boswell, of, canada, com, wrote, that, the, disputed, area, covered, a, 21, 436, square, kilometres, 8, 276, sq, mi, section, of, the, beaufort, sea, he, wrote, that, canada, had, filed, a, diplomatic, note, with, the, us, in, april, when, the, usa, first, announced, plans, for, the, moratorium, jack, layton, leader, of, the, new, democratic, party, of, canada, called, the, u, s, moratorium, over, the, disputed, waters, in, the, beaufort, sea, the, largest, encroachment, on, canadian, territory, in, our, history, several, rivers, such, as, the, kongakut, river, in, alaska, and, the, firth, river, in, yukon, empty, into, the, beaufort, the, major, river, to, flow, into, the, sea, is, the, mackenzie, canada, s, longest, which, empties, into, the, canadian, part, of, the, sea, west, of, tuktoyaktuk, the, coastal, shelf, area, is, rather, narrow, especially, near, and, east, of, point, barrow, in, the, alaskan, part, of, the, sea, and, contains, numerous, submarine, valleys, it, becomes, wider, near, the, delta, of, the, mackenzie, river, but, nowhere, exceeds, 145, km, 90, mi, near, the, coast, the, depths, are, shallower, than, 60, m, 200, ft, but, they, rapidly, increase, northwards, up, to, a, few, kilometers, transforming, into, a, massive, platform, which, is, geologically, similar, to, that, of, the, oceans, there, are, many, small, islands, in, the, sea, and, in, the, delta, of, the, mackenzie, river, a, few, larger, ones, lie, west, of, the, mackenzie, river, such, as, herschel, island, 4, km, 2, 5, mi, off, the, shore, area, 18, km, 2, 6, 9, sq, mi, and, barter, island, 0, 3, km, 0, 19, mi, from, the, coast, area, 13, km, 2, 5, 0, sq, mi, the, coasts, are, low, with, the, maximum, elevations, between, 250, and, 750, m, 820, and, 2, 460, ft, the, soil, is, frozen, all, year, around, at, the, depth, below, about, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, or, less, forming, permafrost, and, only, the, top, few, tens, of, centimeters, thaws, in, summer, consequently, buildings, have, to, be, elevated, above, ground, on, wooden, piles, that, are, immersed, into, the, permafrost, the, beaufort, sea, is, frozen, over, through, the, year, except, for, august, and, september, when, the, ice, breaks, near, the, coast, and, opens, what, was, once, a, 50, 100, km, 31, 62, mi, wide, strip, of, open, water, during, the, 2000s, due, to, climate, change, in, the, arctic, the, ice, free, area, in, late, summer, greatly, enlarged, during, the, record, minimum, extent, of, arctic, sea, ice, in, september, 2012, the, sea, ice, boundary, had, retreated, northward, much, farther, than, normal, from, the, coast, the, channels, of, the, mackenzie, river, thaw, earlier, in, late, may, early, june, this, thawing, increases, the, average, water, discharge, from, about, 150, 000, to, 250, 000, m, 3, s, 5, 300, 000, to, 8, 800, 000, cu, ft, s, hidden, changes, in, the, ice, cover, of, the, beaufort, sea, were, discovered, in, 2009, whereas, the, ice, area, remain, stable, as, detected, by, the, observation, satellites, so, as, the, associated, water, temperature, and, salinity, the, ice, structure, has, changed, recently, the, new, ice, called, rotten, ice, is, thinner, and, much, weaker, structurally, the, sea, water, has, a, stable, temperature, and, is, separated, into, four, distinct, layers, as, follows, the, top, 100, m, 330, ft, are, surface, water, which, has, a, temperature, of, 1, 4, c, 29, 5, f, in, summer, and, 1, 8, c, 28, 8, f, in, winter, the, next, layer, is, formed, by, the, inflows, from, the, pacific, ocean, and, bering, sea, coming, through, the, bering, strait, it, extends, up, to, the, north, pole, the, warmest, deep, atlantic, layer, has, the, temperatures, between, 0, and, 1, c, 32, and, 34, f, and, water, at, the, bottom, is, a, bit, colder, at, 0, 4, to, 0, 8, c, 31, 3, to, 30, 6, f, the, average, salinity, varies, between, 28, and, 32, parts, per, thousand, from, south, to, north, typical, air, temperatures, at, tuktoyaktuk, are, 27, c, 17, f, in, january, and, 11, c, 52, f, in, july, the, water, currents, form, the, clockwise, directed, beaufort, gyre, that, results, in, south, westerly, and, westerly, currents, near, the, shores, the, mackenzie, river, partly, affects, this, circulation, inducing, minor, eastwards, streams, near, its, mouth, the, river, annually, brings, about, 15, million, tonnes, of, sediments, which, are, rich, in, dolomite, and, calcium, carbonate, those, deposits, are, spread, over, the, sea, and, mixed, with, mud, and, gravel, the, shoreline, of, the, beaufort, sea, is, covered, with, tundra, and, marks, the, northern, limit, of, the, terrestrial, range, of, the, polar, bear, in, north, america, the, mackenzie, river, is, an, important, habitat, for, whales, and, seabirds, and, is, still, relatively, untouched, by, commercial, traffic, the, delta, of, mackenzie, river, contains, numerous, lakes, and, ponds, which, are, inhabited, by, muskrat, the, sea, hosts, about, 80, species, of, zooplankton, more, than, 70, species, of, phytoplankton, and, nearly, 700, species, of, polychaetes, bryozoans, crustaceans, and, mollusks, but, their, total, volume, is, relatively, small, owing, to, the, cold, climate, major, fish, species, include, polar, cod, boreogadus, saida, arctic, cod, arctogadus, glacialis, saffron, cod, eleginus, gracilis, arctic, char, salvelinus, alpinus, chum, salmon, oncorhynchus, keta, arctic, cisco, coregonus, autumnalis, least, cisco, coregonus, sardinella, lake, whitefish, coregonus, clupeaformis, broad, whitefish, coregonus, nasus, pacific, herring, clupea, pallasii, fourhorn, sculpin, myoxocephalus, quadricornis, inconnu, stenodus, leucichthys, and, flatfish, the, eastern, part, of, the, sea, is, a, major, habitat, of, beluga, whales, with, an, estimated, population, of, 39, 000, this, population, is, stable, and, might, even, be, increasing, it, is, not, affected, by, the, offshore, oil, exploration, in, the, area, belugas, spend, summer, in, the, coastal, area, and, mackenzie, river, delta, which, are, free, of, ice, then, and, in, winter, migrate, long, distances, to, the, polynyas, of, the, deep, sea, genetic, analyses, have, confirmed, that, belugas, of, the, beaufort, sea, are, clearly, distinct, from, those, of, other, canadian, and, alaskan, waters, despite, often, sharing, a, common, wintering, habitat, the, food, chain, of, the, beaufort, sea, is, relatively, simple, it, starts, with, phytoplankton, and, epontic, algae, single, cell, algae, associated, with, the, lower, interface, of, sea, ice, which, provide, energy, to, zooplankton, and, epontic, and, coastal, amphipods, the, latter, serve, as, a, food, for, seabirds, and, fish, primarily, as, polar, cod, and, arctic, char, polar, cod, is, a, major, food, of, arctic, char, beluga, narwhal, seabirds, and, seals, which, are, dominated, by, the, bearded, seal, erignatus, barbatus, and, ringed, seal, pusa, hispida, bearded, seal, and, walrus, also, feed, on, benthic, invertebrates, on, top, of, the, food, pyramid, stands, the, polar, bear, which, feeds, primarily, on, seals, but, also, on, any, large, marine, mammals, when, it, has, a, chance, such, as, carcasses, and, whales, trapped, in, ice, fields, there, is, only, one, proposed, early, entry, site, in, eastern, beringia, that, still, has, proponents, bluefish, caves, in, the, porcupine, river, basin, yukon, territory, canada, claims, of, great, antiquity, in, the, area, have, a, convoluted, history, a, caribou, tibia, flesher, the, most, diagnostic, human, implement, from, the, old, crow, basin, had, been, dated, at, near, 28, kya, when, redated, using, accelerator, mass, spectrometry, ams, of, small, amounts, of, remnant, collagen, the, bone, produced, a, 1, 8, kya, date, yesner, 1996b, 255, there, is, no, evidence, for, anomalous, occupation, of, beaufort, coasts, in, the, context, of, arctic, cultures, generally, including, the, arrival, about, 4, 000, years, ago, by, paleo, eskimos, such, as, the, dorset, culture, around, 1, 000, years, ago, by, the, thule, and, finally, by, the, modern, inuit, from, early, ages, they, practiced, fishing, bones, of, arctic, char, were, found, at, the, 4, 000, years, old, settlements, while, originally, they, lived, nomadic, life, later, they, started, to, form, permanent, settlements, their, population, is, increasing, but, the, unemployment, rate, is, relatively, high, bowhead, whales, were, hunted, in, the, sea, between, 1888, and, 1914, this, practice, stopped, first, because, of, the, decline, in, whale, population, and, then, because, of, government, regulations, but, resumed, in, the, 1990s, the, major, settlements, along, the, beaufort, sea, are, tuktoyaktuk, population, 930, in, 2009, in, canada, and, prudhoe, bay, alaska, although, prudhoe, bay, is, permanently, populated, by, only, a, few, people, there, are, thousands, of, contract, workers, in, the, area, employed, on, petroleum, production, at, the, prudhoe, bay, oil, field, which, is, on, the, coastal, lowland, known, as, the, north, slope, artificial, islands, such, as, endicott, and, northstar, have, been, raised, near, the, shores, in, 1987, and, 2001, respectively, the, crude, oil, is, transported, through, the, trans, alaska, pipeline, system, to, the, southern, port, of, valdez, fishing, and, sea, hunting, are, practised, by, the, local, inhabitants, and, have, no, commercial, value, especially, after, a, us, moratorium, on, commercial, fishing, of, the, beaufort, sea, adopted, in, 2009, trapping, of, muskrat, at, the, mackenzie, river, delta, was, the, main, source, of, income, for, the, athabaskan, first, nations, peoples, and, inuit, during, 1920, 1960, but, has, since, declined, the, beaufort, sea, contains, major, gas, and, petroleum, reserves, beneath, the, seabed, a, continuation, of, proven, reserves, in, the, nearby, mackenzie, river, and, north, slope, the, beaufort, sea, was, first, explored, for, sub, shelf, hydrocarbons, in, the, 1950s, and, estimated, to, contain, about, 250, km, 3, 60, cu, mi, of, oil, and, 300, 000, km, 3, 72, 000, cu, mi, of, natural, gas, under, its, coastal, shelf, offshore, drilling, began, in, 1972, about, 70, wells, were, set, up, by, the, 1980s, and, 200, wells, by, 2000, these, activities, resulted, in, dredging, of, about, 46, 5, million, m3, of, sea, bottom, soil, as, well, as, discharge, of, drilling, muds, which, contained, barite, clay, caustic, soda, and, heavy, metals, zinc, copper, lead, chromium, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, and, mercury, about, 50, 400, m, 3, 1, 780, 000, cu, ft, of, oil, was, produced, in, 1986, a, major, gas, field, named, taglu, gas, field, was, discovered, in, the, mackenzie, river, delta, in, 1971, followed, by, the, parson, lake, field, and, niglintgak, field, the, estimated, gas, reserves, of, these, fields, are, 58, 600, km, 3, 14, 100, cu, mi, 35, 400, and, 13, 600, km, 3, 8, 500, and, 3, 300, cu, mi, respectively, moreover, further, into, the, sea, from, the, mackenzie, delta, lies, the, amauligak, field, this, the, largest, known, oil, deposit, of, the, beaufort, sea, was, discovered, in, 1984, and, is, estimated, to, contain, 37, 3, km, 3, 8, 9, cu, mi, of, oil, and, 38, 500, km, 3, 9, 200, cu, mi, of, gas, the, development, of, these, fields, is, hindered, by, their, remote, location, this, problem, was, alleviated, for, prudhoe, bay, by, constructing, the, trans, alaska, pipeline, but, is, limiting, regular, commercial, production, at, mackenzie, river, deposits, for, example, the, amauligak, project, was, started, soon, after, the, discovery, of, the, field, in, september, 1985, the, tanker, gulf, beaufort, has, transported, 50, 300, 000, l, 316, 377, bbl, of, crude, oil, to, japan, which, was, the, first, shipment, of, oil, from, the, arctic, deposits, however, the, project, has, stalled, after, that, in, july, 2017, the, u, s, bureau, of, ocean, energy, management, approved, a, plan, to, allow, eni, an, italian, multinational, oil, and, gas, company, to, drill, four, oil, exploration, wells, on, spy, island, one, of, four, artificial, islands, in, the, beaufort, sea, stan, rogers, references, the, beaufort, sea, in, his, popular, canadian, folk, song, northwest, passage
