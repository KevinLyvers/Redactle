the, portuguese, explorer, fernando, p, seeking, a, path, to, india, is, credited, as, being, the, first, european, to, see, the, island, of, bioko, in, 1472, he, called, it, formosa, beautiful, but, it, quickly, took, on, the, name, of, its, european, discoverer, fernando, p, and, annob, n, were, colonized, by, portugal, in, 1474, the, first, factories, were, established, on, the, islands, around, 1500, as, the, portuguese, quickly, recognized, the, positives, of, the, islands, including, volcanic, soil, and, disease, resistant, highlands, despite, natural, advantages, initial, portuguese, efforts, in, 1507, to, establish, a, sugarcane, plantation, and, town, near, what, is, now, concepci, n, on, fernando, p, failed, due, to, bubi, hostility, and, fever, the, main, island,

1778, queen, maria, i, of, portugal, and, king, charles, iii, of, spain, signed, the, treaty, of, el, pardo, which, ceded, bioko, adjacent, islets, and, commercial, rights, to, the, bight, of, biafra, between, the, niger, and, ogoue, rivers, to, spain, in, exchange, for, large, areas, in, south, america, that, are, now, western, brazil, brigadier, felipe, jos, count, of, arjelejos, formally, took, possession, of, bioko, from, portugal, on, 21, october, 1778, after, sailing, for, annob, n, to, take, possession, the, count, died, of, disease, caught, on, bioko, and, the, fever, ridden, crew, mutinied, the, crew, landed, on, s, o, tom, instead, where, they, were, imprisoned, by, the, portuguese, authorities, after, having, lost, over, 80, of, their, men, to, sickness, as, a, result, of, this, disaster, spain, was, thereafter, hesitant, to, invest, heavily, in, its, new, possession, however, despite, the, setback, spaniards, began, to, use, the, island, as, a, base, for, slave, trading, on, the, nearby, mainland, between, 1778, and, 1810, the, territory, of, what, became, equatorial, guinea, was, administered, by, the, viceroyalty, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, based, in, buenos, aires, unwilling, to, invest, heavily, in, the, development, of, fernando, p, from, 1827, to, 1843, the, spanish, leased, a, base, at, malabo, on, bioko, to, the, united, kingdom, which, it, had, sought, as, part, of, its, efforts, to, suppress, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, without, spanish, permission, the, british, moved, the, headquarters, of, the, mixed, commission, for, the, suppression, of, slave, traffic, to, fernando, p, in, 1827, before, moving, it, back, to, sierra, leone, under, an, agreement, with, spain, in, 1843, spain, s, decision, to, abolish, slavery, in, 1817, at, british, insistence, damaged, the, colony, s, perceived, value, to, the, authorities, and, so, leasing, naval, bases, was, an, effective, revenue, earner, from, an, otherwise, unprofitable, possession, an, agreement, by, spain, to, sell, its, african, colony, to, the, british, was, cancelled, in, 1841, due, to, metropolitan, public, opinion, and, opposition, by, spanish, congress, in, 1844, the, british, returned, the, island, to, spanish, control, and, the, area, became, known, as, the, territorios, espa, oles, del, golfo, de, guinea, due, to, epidemics, spain, did, not, invest, much, in, the, colony, and, in, 1862, an, outbreak, of, yellow, fever, killed, many, of, the, whites, that, had, settled, on, the, island, despite, this, plantations, continued, to, be, established, by, private, citizens, through, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, plantations, of, fernando, p, were, mostly, run, by, a, black, creole, elite, later, known, as, fernandinos, the, british, settled, some, 2, 000, sierra, leoneans, and, freed, slaves, there, during, their, rule, and, a, trickle, of, immigration, from, west, africa, and, the, west, indies, continued, after, the, british, left, a, number, of, freed, angolan, slaves, portuguese, african, creoles, and, immigrants, from, nigeria, and, liberia, also, began, to, be, settled, in, the, colony, where, they, quickly, began, to, join, the, new, group, to, the, local, mix, were, added, cubans, filipinos, jews, and, spaniards, of, various, colours, many, of, whom, had, been, deported, to, africa, for, political, or, other, crimes, as, well, as, some, settlers, backed, by, the, government, by, 1870, the, prognosis, of, whites, that, lived, on, the, island, was, much, improved, after, recommendations, that, they, live, in, the, highlands, and, by, 1884, much, of, the, minimal, administrative, machinery, and, key, plantations, had, moved, to, basile, hundreds, of, meters, above, sea, level, henry, morton, stanley, had, labeled, fernando, p, a, jewel, which, spain, did, not, polish, for, refusing, to, enact, such, a, policy, despite, the, improved, survival, chances, of, europeans, living, on, the, island, mary, kingsley, who, was, staying, on, the, island, still, described, fernando, p, as, a, more, uncomfortable, form, of, execution, for, spaniards, appointed, there, there, was, also, a, trickle, of, immigration, from, the, neighboring, portuguese, islands, escaped, slaves, and, prospective, planters, although, a, few, of, the, fernandinos, were, catholic, and, spanish, speaking, about, nine, tenths, of, them, were, protestant, and, english, speaking, on, the, eve, of, the, first, world, war, and, pidgin, english, was, the, lingua, franca, of, the, island, the, sierra, leoneans, were, particularly, well, placed, as, planters, while, labor, recruitment, on, the, windward, coast, continued, for, they, kept, family, and, other, connections, there, and, could, easily, arrange, a, supply, of, labor, the, fernandinos, proved, to, become, effective, traders, and, middlemen, between, the, natives, and, europeans, a, freed, slave, from, the, west, indies, by, way, of, sierra, leone, named, william, pratt, established, the, cocoa, crop, on, fernando, p, spain, had, not, occupied, the, large, area, in, the, bight, of, biafra, to, which, it, had, right, by, treaty, and, the, french, had, busily, expanded, their, occupation, at, the, expense, of, the, territory, claimed, by, spain, madrid, only, partly, backed, the, explorations, of, men, like, manuel, iradier, who, had, signed, treaties, in, the, interior, as, far, as, gabon, and, cameroon, leaving, much, of, the, land, out, of, effective, occupation, as, demanded, by, the, terms, of, the, 1885, berlin, conference, more, important, events, such, as, the, conflict, in, cuba, and, the, eventual, spanish, american, war, kept, madrid, busy, at, an, inopportune, moment, minimal, government, backing, for, mainland, annexation, came, as, a, result, of, public, opinion, and, a, need, for, labour, on, fernando, p, the, eventual, treaty, of, paris, in, 1900, left, spain, with, the, continental, enclave, of, r, o, muni, a, mere, 26, 000, km, 2, out, of, the, 300, 000, stretching, east, to, the, ubangi, river, which, the, spaniards, had, initially, claimed, the, tiny, enclave, was, far, smaller, than, what, the, spaniards, had, considered, themselves, rightfully, entitled, to, under, their, claims, and, the, treaty, of, el, pardo, the, humiliation, of, the, franco, spanish, negotiations, combined, with, the, disaster, in, cuba, led, to, the, head, of, the, spanish, negotiating, team, pedro, gover, y, tovar, committing, suicide, on, the, voyage, home, on, 21, october, 1901, iradier, himself, died, in, despair, in, 1911, and, it, would, be, decades, before, his, achievements, would, be, recognised, by, spanish, popular, opinion, when, the, port, of, cogo, was, renamed, puerto, iradier, in, his, honour, the, opening, years, of, the, twentieth, century, saw, a, new, generation, of, spanish, immigrants, land, regulations, issued, in, 1904, 1905, favoured, spaniards, and, most, of, the, later, big, planters, arrived, from, spain, after, that, an, agreement, made, with, liberia, in, 1914, to, import, cheap, labor, greatly, favoured, wealthy, men, with, ready, access, to, the, state, and, the, shift, in, labor, supplies, from, liberia, to, r, o, muni, increased, this, advantage, due, to, malpractice, however, the, liberian, government, eventually, ended, the, treaty, after, embarrassing, revelations, about, the, state, of, liberian, workers, on, fernando, p, in, the, christy, report, which, brought, down, the, country, s, president, charles, d, b, king, in, 1930, the, greatest, constraint, to, economic, development, was, a, chronic, shortage, of, labour, pushed, into, the, interior, of, the, island, and, decimated, by, alcohol, addiction, venereal, disease, smallpox, and, sleeping, sickness, the, indigenous, bubi, population, of, bioko, refused, to, work, on, plantations, working, their, own, small, cocoa, farms, gave, them, a, considerable, degree, of, autonomy, by, the, late, nineteenth, century, the, bubi, were, protected, from, the, demands, of, the, planters, by, spanish, claretian, missionaries, who, were, very, influential, in, the, colony, and, eventually, organised, the, bubi, into, little, mission, theocracies, reminiscent, of, the, famous, jesuit, reductions, in, paraguay, catholic, penetration, was, furthered, by, two, small, insurrections, in, 1898, and, 1910, protesting, conscription, of, forced, labour, for, the, plantations, the, bubi, were, disarmed, in, 1917, and, left, dependent, on, the, missionaries, serious, labour, shortages, were, temporarily, solved, by, a, massive, influx, of, refugees, from, german, kamerun, along, with, thousands, of, white, german, soldiers, who, stayed, on, the, island, for, several, years, between, 1926, and, 1959, bioko, and, r, o, muni, were, united, as, the, colony, of, spanish, guinea, the, economy, was, based, on, large, cacao, and, coffee, plantations, and, logging, concessions, and, the, workforce, was, mostly, immigrant, contract, labour, from, liberia, nigeria, and, cameroun, between, 1914, and, 1930, an, estimated, 10, 000, liberians, went, to, fernando, po, under, a, labour, treaty, that, was, stopped, altogether, in, 1930, with, liberian, workers, no, longer, available, planters, of, fernando, po, turned, to, r, o, muni, campaigns, were, mounted, to, subdue, the, fang, people, in, the, 1920s, at, the, time, that, liberia, was, beginning, to, cut, back, on, recruitment, there, were, garrisons, of, the, colonial, guard, throughout, the, enclave, by, 1926, and, the, whole, colony, was, considered, pacified, by, 1929, the, spanish, civil, war, had, a, major, impact, on, the, colony, a, group, of, 150, spanish, whites, including, the, governor, general, and, vice, governor, general, of, r, o, muni, created, a, socialist, party, called, the, popular, front, in, the, enclave, which, served, to, oppose, the, interests, of, the, fernando, p, plantation, owners, when, the, war, broke, out, francisco, franco, ordered, nationalist, forces, based, in, the, canaries, to, ensure, control, over, equatorial, guinea, in, september, 1936, nationalist, forces, backed, by, falangists, from, fernando, p, similarly, to, what, happened, in, spain, proper, took, control, of, r, o, muni, which, under, governor, general, luiz, sanchez, guerra, saez, and, his, deputy, porcel, had, backed, the, republican, government, by, november, the, popular, front, and, its, supporters, had, been, defeated, and, equatorial, guinea, secured, for, franco, the, commander, in, charge, of, the, occupation, juan, font, n, lob, was, appointed, governor, general, by, franco, and, began, to, exert, more, effective, spanish, control, over, the, enclave, interior, r, o, muni, had, a, small, population, officially, a, little, over, 100, 000, in, the, 1930s, and, escape, across, the, frontiers, into, cameroun, or, gabon, was, very, easy, also, the, timber, companies, needed, increasing, numbers, of, workers, and, the, spread, of, coffee, cultivation, offered, an, alternative, means, of, paying, taxes, fernando, p, thus, continued, to, suffer, from, labour, shortages, the, french, only, briefly, permitted, recruitment, in, cameroun, and, the, main, source, of, labour, came, to, be, igbo, smuggled, in, canoes, from, calabar, in, nigeria, this, resolution, to, the, worker, shortage, allowed, fernando, p, to, become, one, of, africa, s, most, productive, agricultural, areas, after, the, second, world, war, politically, post, war, colonial, history, has, three, fairly, distinct, phases, up, to, 1959, when, its, status, was, raised, from, colonial, to, provincial, following, the, approach, of, the, portuguese, empire, between, 1960, and, 1968, when, madrid, attempted, a, partial, decolonisation, aimed, at, keeping, the, territory, as, part, of, the, spanish, system, and, from, 1968, on, after, the, territory, became, an, independent, republic, the, first, phase, consisted, of, little, more, than, a, continuation, of, previous, policies, these, closely, resembled, the, policies, of, portugal, and, france, notably, in, dividing, the, population, into, a, vast, majority, governed, as, natives, or, non, citizens, and, a, very, small, minority, together, with, whites, admitted, to, civic, status, as, emancipados, assimilation, to, the, metropolitan, culture, being, the, only, permissible, means, of, advancement, this, provincial, phase, saw, the, beginnings, of, nationalism, but, chiefly, among, small, groups, who, had, taken, refuge, from, the, caudillo, s, paternal, hand, in, cameroun, and, gabon, they, formed, two, bodies, the, movimiento, nacional, de, liberaci, n, de, la, guinea, monalige, and, the, idea, popular, de, guinea, ecuatorial, ipge, the, pressure, they, could, bring, to, bear, was, weak, but, the, general, trend, in, west, africa, was, not, and, by, the, late, 1960s, much, of, the, african, continent, had, been, granted, independence, aware, of, this, trend, the, spanish, began, to, increase, efforts, to, prepare, the, country, for, independence, and, massively, stepped, up, development, the, gross, national, product, per, capita, in, 1965, was, 466, which, was, the, highest, in, black, africa, and, the, spanish, constructed, an, international, airport, at, santa, isabel, a, television, station, and, increased, the, literacy, rate, to, a, relatively, high, 89, at, the, same, time, measures, were, taken, to, battle, sleeping, sickness, and, leprosy, in, the, enclave, and, by, 1967, the, number, of, hospital, beds, per, capita, in, equatorial, guinea, was, higher, than, spain, itself, with, 1637, beds, in, 16, hospitals, all, the, same, measures, to, improve, education, floundered, and, like, in, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, by, the, end, of, colonial, rule, the, number, of, africans, in, higher, education, was, in, only, the, double, digits, and, political, education, necessary, to, a, functioning, state, was, negligible, a, decision, of, 9, august, 1963, approved, by, a, referendum, of, 15, december, 1963, gave, the, territory, a, measure, of, autonomy, and, the, administrative, promotion, of, a, moderate, group, the, movimiento, de, uni, n, nacional, de, guinea, ecuatorial, munge, this, proved, a, feeble, instrument, and, with, growing, pressure, for, change, from, the, un, madrid, was, gradually, forced, to, give, way, to, the, currents, of, nationalism, two, general, assembly, resolutions, were, passed, in, 1965, ordering, spain, to, grant, independence, to, the, colony, and, in, 1966, a, un, commission, toured, the, country, before, recommending, the, same, thing, in, response, the, spanish, declared, that, they, would, hold, a, constitutional, convention, on, 27, october, 1967, to, negotiate, a, new, constitution, for, an, independent, equatorial, guinea, the, conference, was, attended, by, 41, local, delegates, and, 25, spaniards, the, africans, were, principally, divided, between, fernandinos, and, bubi, on, one, side, who, feared, a, loss, of, privileges, and, swamping, by, the, fang, majority, and, the, r, o, muni, fang, nationalists, on, the, other, at, the, conference, the, leading, fang, figure, the, later, first, president, francisco, mac, as, nguema, gave, a, controversial, speech, in, which, he, claimed, that, adolf, hitler, had, saved, africa, after, nine, sessions, the, conference, was, suspended, due, to, deadlock, between, the, unionists, and, separatists, who, wanted, a, separate, fernando, p, mac, as, resolved, to, travel, to, the, un, to, bolster, international, awareness, of, the, issue, and, his, firebrand, speeches, in, new, york, contributed, to, spain, naming, a, date, for, both, independence, and, general, elections, in, july, 1968, virtually, all, bubi, leaders, went, to, the, un, in, new, york, to, try, and, raise, awareness, for, their, cause, but, the, world, community, was, uninterested, in, quibbling, over, the, specifics, of, colonial, independence, the, 1960s, were, a, time, of, great, optimism, over, the, future, of, the, former, african, colonies, and, groups, that, had, been, close, to, european, rulers, like, the, bubi, were, not, viewed, positively, independence, from, spain, was, gained, on, 12, october, 1968, at, noon, in, the, capital, malabo, the, new, country, became, the, republic, of, equatorial, guinea, the, date, is, celebrated, as, the, country, s, independence, day, mac, as, became, president, in, the, country, s, only, free, and, fair, election, to, date, the, spanish, ruled, by, franco, had, backed, mac, as, in, the, election, due, to, his, perceived, loyalty, however, while, on, the, campaign, trail, he, had, proven, to, be, far, less, easy, to, handle, than, they, had, expected, much, of, his, campaigning, involved, visiting, rural, areas, of, r, o, muni, and, promising, young, fang, that, they, would, have, the, houses, and, wives, of, the, spanish, if, they, voted, for, him, in, the, towns, he, had, instead, presented, himself, as, the, urbane, leader, who, had, bested, the, spanish, at, the, un, and, he, had, won, in, the, second, round, of, voting, the, euphoria, of, independence, became, quickly, overshadowed, by, problems, emanating, from, the, nigerian, civil, war, fernando, p, was, inhabited, by, many, biafra, supporting, ibo, migrant, workers, and, many, refugees, from, the, breakaway, state, fled, to, the, island, straining, it, to, breaking, point, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, began, running, relief, flights, out, of, equatorial, guinea, but, mac, as, quickly, became, spooked, and, shut, the, flights, down, refusing, to, allow, them, to, fly, diesel, fuel, for, their, trucks, nor, oxygen, tanks, for, medical, operations, very, quickly, the, biafran, separatists, were, starved, into, submission, without, international, backing, after, the, public, prosecutor, complained, about, excesses, and, maltreatment, by, government, officials, mac, as, had, 150, alleged, coup, plotters, executed, in, a, purge, on, christmas, eve, 1969, all, of, whom, were, political, opponents, macias, nguema, further, consolidated, his, totalitarian, powers, by, outlawing, opposition, political, parties, in, july, 1970, and, making, himself, president, for, life, in, 1972, he, broke, off, ties, with, spain, and, the, west, in, spite, of, his, condemnation, of, marxism, which, he, deemed, neo, colonialist, equatorial, guinea, maintained, very, special, relations, with, communist, states, notably, china, cuba, east, germany, and, the, ussr, macias, nguema, signed, a, preferential, trade, agreement, and, a, shipping, treaty, with, the, soviet, union, the, soviets, also, made, loans, to, equatorial, guinea, the, shipping, agreement, gave, the, soviets, permission, for, a, pilot, fishery, development, project, and,
