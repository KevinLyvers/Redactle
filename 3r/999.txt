around, ankara, was, very, similar, to, that, being, spoken, in, the, northwest, of, the, roman, world, near, trier, the, city, was, subsequently, passed, under, the, control, of, the, roman, empire, in, 25, bc, emperor, augustus, raised, it, to, the, status, of, a, polis, and, made, it, the, capital, city, of, the, roman, province, of, galatia, ankara, is, famous, for, the, monumentum, ancyranum, temple, of, augustus, and, rome, which, contains, the, official, record, of, the, acts, of, augustus, known, as, the, res, gestae, divi, augusti, an, inscription, cut, in, marble, on, the, walls, of,

and, pessinus, balhisar, to, the, west, near, sivrihisar, continued, to, be, reasonably, important, settlements, in, the, roman, period, but, it, was, ancyra, that, grew, into, a, grand, metropolis, an, estimated, 200, 000, people, lived, in, ancyra, in, good, times, during, the, roman, empire, a, far, greater, number, than, was, to, be, the, case, from, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, until, the, early, 20th, century, the, small, ankara, river, ran, through, the, center, of, the, roman, town, it, has, now, been, covered, and, diverted, but, it, formed, the, northern, boundary, of, the, old, town, during, the, roman, byzantine, and, ottoman, periods, ankaya, the, rim, of, the, majestic, hill, to, the, south, of, the, present, city, center, stood, well, outside, the, roman, city, but, may, have, been, a, summer, resort, in, the, 19th, century, the, remains, of, at, least, one, roman, villa, or, large, house, were, still, standing, not, far, from, where, the, ankaya, presidential, residence, stands, today, to, the, west, the, roman, city, extended, until, the, area, of, the, gen, lik, park, and, railway, station, while, on, the, southern, side, of, the, hill, it, may, have, extended, downward, as, far, as, the, site, presently, occupied, by, hacettepe, university, it, was, thus, a, sizeable, city, by, any, standards, and, much, larger, than, the, roman, towns, of, gaul, or, britannia, ancyra, s, importance, rested, on, the, fact, that, it, was, the, junction, point, where, the, roads, in, northern, anatolia, running, north, south, and, east, west, intersected, giving, it, major, strategic, importance, for, rome, s, eastern, frontier, the, great, imperial, road, running, east, passed, through, ankara, and, a, succession, of, emperors, and, their, armies, came, this, way, they, were, not, the, only, ones, to, use, the, roman, highway, network, which, was, equally, convenient, for, invaders, in, the, second, half, of, the, 3rd, century, ancyra, was, invaded, in, rapid, succession, by, the, goths, coming, from, the, west, who, rode, far, into, the, heart, of, cappadocia, taking, slaves, and, pillaging, and, later, by, the, arabs, for, about, a, decade, the, town, was, one, of, the, western, outposts, of, one, of, palmyrean, empress, zenobia, in, the, syrian, desert, who, took, advantage, of, a, period, of, weakness, and, disorder,

multiple, up, to, four, emperors, introduced, by, diocletian, 284, 305, seems, to, have, engaged, in, a, substantial, program, of, rebuilding, and, of, road, construction, from, ancyra, westwards, to, germe, and, dorylaeum, now, eski, ehir, in, its, heyday, roman, ancyra, was, a, large, market, and, trading, center, but, it, also, functioned, as, a, major, administrative, capital, where, a, high, official, ruled, from, the, city, s, praetorium, a, large, administrative, palace, or, office, during, the, 3rd, century, life, in, ancyra, as, in, other, anatolian, towns, seems, to, have, become,
