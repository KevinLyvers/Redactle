original, nuclei, of, the, city, are, vertical, characterized, by, the, presence, of, commercial, buildings, and, services, and, the, peripheries, are, generally, developed, with, two, to, four, story, buildings, although, such, generalization, certainly, meets, with, exceptions, in, the, fabric, of, the, metropolis, compared, to, other, global, cities, such, as, the, island, cities, of, new, york, city, and, hong, kong, however, s, o, paulo, is, considered, a, low, rise, building, city, its, tallest, buildings, rarely, reach, forty, stories, and, the, average, residential, building, is, twenty, nevertheless, it, is, the, fourth, city, in, the, world, in, quantity, of, buildings, according, to, the, page, specialized, in, research, of, data, on, buildings, emporis, buildings, besides,

floors, such, tissue, heterogeneity, however, is, not, as, predictable, as, the, generic, model, can, make, us, imagine, some, central, regions, of, the, city, began, to, concentrate, indigents, drug, trafficking, street, vending, and, prostitution, which, encouraged, the, creation, of, new, socio, economic, centralities, the, characterization, of, each, region, of, the, city, also, underwent, several, changes, throughout, the, 20th, century, with, the, relocation, of, industries, to, other, cities, or, states, several, areas, that, once, housed, factory, sheds, have, become, commercial, or, even, residential, areas, s, o, paulo, has, a, history, of, actions, projects, and, plans, related, to, urban, planning, that, can, be, traced, to, the, governments, of, antonio, da, silva, prado, baron, duprat, washington, and, luis, francisco, prestes, maia, however, in, general, the, city, was, formed, during, the, 20th, century, growing, from, village, to, metropolis, through, a, series, of, informal, processes, and, irregular, urban, sprawl, urban, growth, in, s, o, paulo, has, followed, three, patterns, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, according, to, urban, historians, since, the, late, 19th, century, and, until, the, 1940s, s, o, paulo, was, a, condensed, city, in, which, different, social, groups, lived, in, a, small, urban, zone, separated, by, type, of, housing, from, the, 1940s, to, the, 1980s, s, o, paulo, followed, a, model, of, center, periphery, social, segregation, in, which, the, upper, and, middle, classes, occupied, central, and, modern, areas, while, the, poor, moved, towards, precarious, self, built, housing, in, the, periphery, and, from, the, 1980s, onward, new, transformations, have, brought, the, social, classes, closer, together, in, spatial, terms, but, separated, by, walls, and, security, technologies, that, seek, to, isolate, the, richer, classes, in, the, name, of, security, thus, s, o, paulo, differs, considerably, from, other, brazilian, cities, such, as, belo, horizonte, and, goi, nia, whose, initial, expansion, followed, determinations, by, a, plan, or, a, city, like, bras, lia, whose, master, plan, had, been, fully, developed, prior, to, construction, the, effectiveness, of, these, plans, has, been, seen, by, some, planners, and, historians, as, questionable, some, of, these, scholars, argue, that, such, plans, were, produced, exclusively, for, the, benefit, of, the, wealthier, strata, of, the, population, while, the, working, classes, would, be, relegated, to, the, traditional, informal, processes, in, s, o, paulo, until, the, mid, 1950s, the, plans, were, based, on, the, idea, of, demolish, and, rebuild, including, former, mayor, francisco, prestes, maia, s, road, plan, for, s, o, paulo, known, as, the, avenues, plan, or, saturnino, de, brito, s, plan, for, the, tiet, river, the, plan, of, the, avenues, was, implemented, during, the, 1920s, and, sought, to, build, large, avenues, connecting, the, city, center, with, the, outskirts, this, plan, included, renewing, the, commercial, city, center, leading, to, real, estate, speculation, and, gentrification, of, several, downtown, neighborhoods, the, plan, also, led, to, the, expansion, of, bus, services, which, would, soon, replace, the, trolley, as, the, preliminary, transportation, system, this, contributed, to, the, outwards, expansion, of, s, o, paulo, and, the, peripherization, of, poorer, residents, peripheral, neighborhoods, were, usually, unregulated, and, consisted, mainly, of, self, built, single, family, houses, in, 1968, the, urban, development, plan, proposed, the, basic, plan, for, integrated, development, of, s, o, paulo, under, the, administration, of, figueiredo, ferraz, the, main, result, was, zoning, laws, it, lasted, until, 2004, when, the, basic, plan, was, replaced, by, the, current, master, plan, that, zoning, adopted, in, 1972, designated, z1, areas, residential, areas, designed, for, elites, and, z3, a, mixed, zone, lacking, clear, definitions, about, their, characteristics, zoning, encouraged, the, growth, of, suburbs, with, minimal, control, and, major, speculation, after, the, 1970s, peripheral, lot, regulation, increased, and, infrastructure, in, the, periphery, improved, driving, land, prices, up, the, poorest, and, the, newcomers, now, could, not, purchase, their, lot, and, build, their, house, and, were, forced, to, look, for, a, housing, alternative, as, a, result, favelas, and, precarious, tenements, corti, os, appeared, these, housing, types, were, often, closer, to, the, city, s, center, favelas, could, sprawl, in, any, unused, terrain, often, dangerous, or, unsanitary, and, decaying, or, abandoned, buildings, for, tenements, were, abundant, inside, the, city, favelas, went, back, into, the, urban, perimeter, occupying, the, small, lots, not, yet, occupied, by, urbanization, alongside, polluted, rivers, railways, or, between, bridges, by, 1993,
