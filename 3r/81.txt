the, greenland, sea, is, a, body, of, water, that, borders, greenland, to, the, west, the, svalbard, archipelago, to, the, east, fram, strait, and, the, arctic, ocean, to, the, north, and, the, norwegian, sea, and, iceland, to, the, south, the, greenland, sea, is, often, defined, as, part, of, the, arctic, ocean, sometimes, as, part, of, the, atlantic, ocean, however, definitions, of, the, arctic, ocean, and, its, seas, tend, to, be, imprecise, or, arbitrary, in, general, usage, the, term, arctic, ocean, would, exclude, the, greenland, sea, in, oceanographic, studies, the, greenland, sea, is, considered, part, of, the, nordic, seas, along, with, the, norwegian, sea, the, nordic, seas, are, the, main, connection, between, the, arctic, and, atlantic, oceans, and, as, such, could, be, of, great, significance, in, a, possible, shutdown, of, thermohaline, circulation, in, oceanography, the, arctic, ocean, and, nordic, seas, are, often, referred, to, collectively, as, the, arctic, mediterranean, sea, a, marginal, sea, of, the, atlantic, the, sea, has, arctic, climate, with, regular, northern, winds, and, temperatures, rarely, rising, above, 0, c, 32, f, it, previously, contained, the, odden, ice, tongue, or, odden, area, which, extended, eastward, from, the, main, east, greenland, ice, edge, in, the, vicinity, of, 72, 74, n, during, the, winter, and, acted, as, a, key, winter, ice, formation, area, in, the, arctic, the, west, ice, forms, in, winter, in, the, greenland, sea, north, of, iceland, between, greenland, and, jan, mayen, island, it, is, a, major, breeding, ground, of, harp, seal, and, hooded, seal, that, has, been, used, for, seal, hunting, for, more, than, 200, years, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, greenland, sea, as, follows, on, the, north, a, line, joining, the, northernmost, point, of, spitzbergen, to, the, northernmost, point, of, greenland, on, the, east, the, west, coast, of, west, spitzbergen, on, the, southeast, a, line, joining, the, southernmost, point, of, west, spitzbergen, to, the, northern, point, of, jan, mayen, island, down, the, west, coast, of, that, island, to, its, southern, extreme, thence, a, line, to, the, eastern, extreme, of, gerpir, 67, 05, n, 13, 30, w, in, iceland, on, the, southwest, a, line, joining, straumnes, nw, extreme, of, iceland, to, cape, nansen, 68, 15, n, 29, 30, w, 68, 250, n, 29, 500, w, 68, 250, 29, 500, in, greenland, on, the, west, the, east, and, northeast, coast, of, greenland, between, cape, nansen, and, the, northernmost, point, while, the, sea, has, been, known, for, millennia, the, first, scientific, investigations, were, carried, out, in, 1876, 1878, as, part, of, the, norwegian, north, atlantic, expedition, since, then, many, countries, mostly, norway, iceland, and, russia, have, sent, scientific, expeditions, to, the, area, the, complex, water, current, system, in, the, greenland, sea, was, described, in, 1909, by, fridtjof, nansen, the, greenland, sea, was, a, popular, hunting, ground, for, the, whaling, industry, for, 300, years, until, 1911, primarily, based, in, spitsbergen, at, that, point, the, formerly, rich, whale, population, here, was, so, depleted, that, the, industry, was, no, longer, profitable, the, remaining, whales, of, the, greenland, sea, has, been, protected, ever, since, but, the, populations, have, not, shown, any, proof, of, significant, regeneration, since, the, late, 1990s, polar, biologists, reports, an, increase, in, the, local, bowhead, whale, population, and, in, 2015, arctic, scientists, discovered, a, surprising, abundance, of, them, in, a, small, area, these, results, may, be, interpreted, as, an, early, sign, of, a, beginning, recovery, for, this, particular, species, that, once, formed, the, largest, bowhead, population, in, the, world, at, an, estimated, 52, 000, whales, the, inuit, hunted, whales, on, a, non, industrial, scale, in, the, greenland, sea, since, the, 15th, century, as, evidenced, by, archaeology, the, first, complete, man, powered, crossing, of, the, greenland, sea, was, achieved, in, 2017, by, rowing, expedition, polar, row, led, by, fiann, paul, the, greenland, sea, is, bounded, to, the, west, by, the, island, of, greenland, and, to, the, south, by, the, denmark, strait, and, iceland, to, the, southeast, behind, the, jan, mayen, island, norway, lies, the, vast, expanse, of, the, norwegian, sea, of, which, greenland, sea, may, be, considered, an, extension, across, the, fram, strait, to, the, northeast, the, sea, is, delimited, by, the, svalbard, archipelago, norway, the, southern, part, of, the, greenland, sea, roughly, the, area, south, of, the, jan, mayen, francture, zone, or, the, line, cape, brewster, jan, mayen, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, iceland, sea, the, bottom, of, the, greenland, sea, is, a, depression, bounded, to, the, south, by, the, underwater, greenland, iceland, ridge, and, to, the, east, by, the, mohns, ridge, and, knipovich, ridge, parts, of, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, to, the, west, the, bottom, rises, first, slowly, but, then, rapidly, toward, the, wide, greenland, coastal, strip, silts, fill, the, submarine, hollows, and, gorges, silty, sands, gravel, boulders, and, other, products, of, erosion, coat, the, shelves, and, ridges, although, the, deepest, point, inside, of, the, sea, is, 4, 846, m, 15, 899, ft, depths, down, to, 5, 570, m, 18, 270, ft, have, been, measured, in, the, molloy, deep, of, the, fram, strait, which, connects, the, sea, to, the, arctic, ocean, on, the, north, the, greenland, ice, sheet, reaches, down, to, the, sea, at, jokel, bay, major, islands, of, the, greenland, sea, include, the, svalbard, archipelago, jan, mayen, as, well, as, coastal, islands, off, the, ne, greenland, shores, such, as, hovgaard, ella, godfred, hansen, le, de, france, lynn, norske, gamma, and, schnauder, islands, of, those, only, the, svalbard, islands, are, inhabited, and, jan, mayen, has, only, temporal, military, staff, after, the, league, of, nations, gave, norway, jurisdiction, over, the, island, in, 1921, norway, opened, the, first, meteorological, station, there, which, was, a, subject, of, contention, between, germany, and, united, kingdom, during, world, war, ii, several, radio, and, meteorological, stations, operate, on, the, island, nowadays, the, climate, is, arctic, and, varies, significantly, across, the, vast, sea, area, air, temperatures, fluctuate, between, 49, c, 56, f, near, spitsbergen, in, winter, and, 25, c, 77, f, off, greenland, in, summer, averages, are, 10, c, 14, f, in, the, south, and, 26, c, 15, f, in, the, north, in, february, which, is, the, coldest, month, the, corresponding, values, for, the, warmest, month, august, are, 5, c, 41, f, in, the, south, and, 0, c, 32, f, in, the, north, the, summer, is, very, short, the, number, of, days, per, year, when, the, temperature, rises, above, 0, c, 32, f, varies, between, 225, in, the, north, to, 334, in, the, south, the, annual, precipitation, is, 250, mm, 10, in, in, the, north, but, 500, mm, 20, in, in, the, south, northern, winds, continue, through, the, whole, year, cooling, the, surface, water, and, bringing, ice, to, the, south, the, average, surface, water, temperature, is, about, 1, c, 30, f, or, lower, in, the, north, and, 1, 2, c, 34, 36, f, in, the, south, the, corresponding, summer, temperatures, are, about, 0, and, 6, c, 32, and, 43, f, respectively, the, bottom, water, temperatures, are, below, 1, c, 30, f, the, surface, water, salinity, is, 3, 30, 3, 45, in, the, eastern, and, below, 3, 20, in, the, western, parts, increasing, to, 3, 49, toward, the, bottom, the, water, is, green, tides, are, semidiurnal, with, the, average, height, of, 4, 4, m, 14, 4, ft, together, with, the, water, currents, they, break, up, the, floating, ice, sheets, and, mix, various, water, layers, both, laterally, and, along, the, depth, the, progressively, colder, waters, of, north, atlantic, current, sink, in, the, arctic, ocean, returning, south, in, the, form, of, cold, east, greenland, current, an, important, part, of, the, atlantic, conveyor, belt, which, flows, along, the, western, part, of, the, sea, along, the, eastern, part, flows, the, warm, spitsbergen, current, a, part, of, gulf, stream, mixtures, of, cold, freshwater, ice, melt, and, the, warm, salty, spitsbergen, current, may, experience, cabbeling, which, might, contribute, to, thermohaline, circulation, the, combination, of, those, currents, creates, a, counter, clockwise, water, flow, in, the, central, part, of, the, sea, because, of, frequent, fogs, winds, and, currents, which, continuously, transport, ice, and, icebergs, through, the, greenland, sea, to, the, south, the, greenland, sea, has, a, narrow, window, for, commercial, navigation, the, ice, season, starts, in, october, and, ends, in, august, three, types, of, floating, ice, are, distinguished, arctic, pack, ice, several, meters, thick, sea, ice, about, a, meter, thick, and, freshwater, icebergs, in, winter, a, large, area, north, of, iceland, between, greenland, and, jan, mayen, called, west, ice, is, covered, by, continuous, ice, it, is, a, major, breeding, ground, for, seals, including, harp, seal, hooded, seal, and, gray, seal, it, was, discovered, in, the, early, 18th, century, by, british, whalers, and, since, late, 1750s, was, used, for, seal, hunting, the, hunting, was, especially, intensive, in, the, 19th, century, but, declined, in, the, 20th, century, because, of, hunting, restrictions, and, lower, market, demand, around, 5, april, 1952, a, major, storm, resulted, in, disappearance, of, ships, with, 79, norwegian, seal, hunters, on, board, seven, other, norwegian, seal, hunting, vessels, shipwrecked, the, same, month, the, odden, ice, tongue, or, simply, the, odden, odden, is, norwegian, word, for, headland, was, a, key, winter, ice, formation, area, in, the, arctic, it, was, known, for, a, long, time, and, was, encountered, by, fridtjof, nansen, but, was, only, fully, understood, with, the, advent, of, satellite, imagery, the, odden, had, a, length, of, about, 1, 300, km, 810, mi, and, covered, an, area, of, up, to, 330, 000, km, 2, 130, 000, sq, mi, in, most, years, it, extended, eastward, from, the, main, east, greenland, ice, edge, in, the, vicinity, of, 72, 74, n, during, the, winter, because, of, the, presence, of, very, cold, polar, surface, water, in, the, jan, mayen, current, which, diverts, some, water, eastward, from, the, east, greenland, current, at, that, latitude, most, of, the, already, formed, ice, continued, floating, south, driven, by, the, wind, so, a, cold, open, water, surface, was, exposed, on, which, new, ice, formed, as, frazil, ice, and, pancake, ice, in, the, rough, seas, producing, a, giant, tongue, shape, the, salt, rejected, back, into, the, ocean, from, this, ice, formation, caused, the, surface, water, to, become, denser, and, sink, sometimes, to, great, depths, 2, 500, m, 8, 200, ft, or, more, making, this, one, of, the, few, regions, of, the, ocean, where, winter, convection, occurred, which, helped, drive, the, entire, worldwide, system, of, surface, and, deep, currents, known, as, the, thermohaline, circulation, since, the, 1990s, the, odden, ice, tongue, rarely, develops, the, greenland, sea, is, densely, inhabited, by, the, organisms, that, form, the, base, of, the, oceanic, food, chain, large, invertebrates, fish, such, as, cod, herring, redfish, halibut, and, plaice, birds, and, mammals, including, various, species, of, seals, whales, and, dolphins, all, feed, on, the, smaller, invertebrates, and, small, organisms, mosses, lichens, and, scanty, bushes, around, the, coasts, serve, as, food, to, the, deer, and, musk, oxen, which, in, turn, are, hunted, by, the, polar, bear, the, greenland, sea, was, formerly, home, to, a, large, population, of, various, whale, species, especially, bowhead, whales, but, the, whaling, industry, decimated, them, greatly, from, the, beginning, of, the, 1600s, till, 1911, in, the, last, few, decades, there, have, been, a, few, signs, indicating, a, beginning, recovery, us, geological, survey, has, estimated, that, at, least, 13, of, the, world, s, undiscovered, oil, deposits, and, 30, of, the, world, s, undiscovered, gas, pockets, are, located, in, the, arctic, with, the, greenland, sea, potentially, holding, large, amounts, of, natural, gas, and, lesser, amounts, of, natural, gas, liquids, and, crude, oil, this, has, led, the, greenland, s, minister, and, provincial, council, to, offer, a, large, number, of, off, shore, concessions, to, potential, hydrocarbon, oil, and, gas, extraction, the, majority, of, the, concessions, are, located, in, seas, west, of, greenland, primarily, the, davis, strait, and, baffin, bay, but, with, 19, concessions, in, the, greenland, sea, in, late, 2013, a, total, of, three, consortia, obtained, hydrocarbon, extraction, rights, to, four, large, areas, of, the, greenland, sea, from, the, greenland, bureau, of, mineral, and, petroleum, the, consortia, are, led, by, the, oil, companies, of, statoil, chevron, and, eni, but, includes, several, other, smaller, companies, such, as, shell, bp, dong, energy, and, nunaoil, since, then, a, fifth, hydrocarbon, concession, has, been, sold, exxonmobil, the, largest, oil, company, in, the, world, and, with, a, lot, of, experience, in, the, arctic, was, also, applying, for, oil, extraction, rights, in, the, greenland, sea, initially, but, pulled, out, in, december, 2013, for, unexplained, reasons, concentrating, efforts, on, shale, gas, and, the, american, market, instead, drilling, for, oil, in, deep, waters, in, an, ice, filled, arctic, environment, is, a, potential, new, undertaking, for, the, oil, industry, and, poses, many, risks, and, dangers, because, of, these, difficulties, the, greenland, minister, council, expects, the, first, exploratory, drills, to, take, place, no, sooner, than, the, mid, 2020s, they, estimate, that, a, full, preliminary, program, with, seismic, surveys, exploratory, drills, and, proper, safety, measures, will, take, about, 16, years, and, an, investment, of, about, us, 500, million, in, each, concession
