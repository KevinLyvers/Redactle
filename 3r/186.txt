historical, region, of, ingria, to, the, neva, bay, of, the, gulf, of, finland, despite, its, modest, length, of, 74, kilometres, 46, mi, it, is, the, fourth, largest, river, in, europe, in, terms, of, average, discharge, after, the, volga, the, danube, and, the, rhine, the, neva, is, the, only, river, flowing, from, lake, ladoga, it, flows, through, the, city, of, saint, petersburg, the, three, smaller, towns, of, shlisselburg, kirovsk, and, otradnoye, and, dozens, of, settlements, it, is, navigable, throughout, and, is, part, of, the, volga, baltic, waterway, and, white, sea, baltic, canal, it, is, the, site, of, many, major, historical, events, including, the, battle, of, the, neva, in, 1240, which, gave, alexander, nevsky, his, name, the, founding, of, saint, petersburg, in, 1703, and, the, siege, of, leningrad, by, the, german, army, during, world, war, ii, the, river, played, a, vital, role, in, trade, between, byzantium, and, scandinavia, the, earliest, people, in, recorded, history, known, to, have, inhabited, the, area, are, the, finnic, people, the, word, neva, is, widespread, in, finnic, languages, having, quite, cognate, meanings, in, finnish, it, means, poor, fen, in, karelian, watercourse, and, in, estonian, as, n, va, waterway, it, has, been, postulated, the, name, could, derive, from, indo, european, adjective, new, which, means, new, the, river, began, its, flow, some, time, between, 2000, bc, and, 1250, bc, however, the, local, place, names, with, such, influence, coincide, with, scandinavian, traders, and, slavs, first, main, settlement, in, the, region, in, the, 8th, century, ad, in, the, paleozoic, 300, 400, million, years, ago, all, the, delta, region, was, covered, by, a, sea, modern, relief, eminences, were, formed, by, glacial, scouring, its, retreat, formed, the, littorina, sea, the, level, of, which, was, 7, to, 9, metres, 23, to, 30, ft, higher, than, its, successor, the, baltic, sea, then, the, tosna, was, flowing, in, the, modern, lower, half, of, the, neva, as, today, into, the, litorinal, sea, in, the, north, of, the, karelian, isthmus, the, sea, was, united, by, a, wide, strait, with, lake, ladoga, the, mga, then, flowed, to, the, east, into, lake, ladoga, near, the, modern, source, of, the, neva, thus, the, mga, then, was, separate, from, the, tosna, lower, neva, basin, near, the, modern, lake, ladoga, by, glacial, rebound, land, rose, faster, and, an, endorheic, lake, briefly, formed, this, overspilled, eventually, the, whole, mga, valley, and, thus, broke, into, the, western, valley, the, valley, of, the, tosna, lower, neva, the, ivanovo, rapids, of, the, modern, neva, were, created, at, the, breakthrough, according, to, early, books, the, breakthrough, may, have, been, about, 2000, bc, but, according, to, more, recent, research, this, happened, at, 1410, 1250, bc, making, the, river, rather, young, the, valley, is, lined, with, glacial, and, post, glacial, sediments, and, has, changed, little, over, 2, 500, years, the, delta, was, formed, at, that, time, technically, a, pseudodelta, as, not, from, accumulation, of, river, material, but, by, scouring, past, sediments, the, neva, flows, out, of, lake, ladoga, near, shlisselburg, flows, through, neva, s, lowlands, and, discharges, into, the, baltic, sea, in, the, gulf, of, finland, it, has, a, length, of, 74, kilometres, 46, mi, and, the, shortest, distance, from, the, source, to, the, mouth, is, 45, kilometres, 28, mi, the, river, banks, are, low, and, steep, on, average, about, 3, to, 6, metres, 10, to, 20, ft, and, 2, to, 3, metres, 7, to, 10, ft, at, the, mouth, there, are, three, sharp, turns, the, ivanovskye, rapids, at, nevsky, forest, park, of, the, ust, slavyanka, region, the, so, called, crooked, knee, and, near, the, smolny, institute, below, the, mouth, of, the, river, okhta, the, river, declines, 4, 27, metres, 14, 0, ft, in, elevation, between, source, and, mouth, at, one, point, the, river, crosses, a, moraine, ridge, and, forms, the, ivanovskye, rapids, there, at, the, beginning, of, the, rapids, is, the, narrowest, part, of, the, river, 210, metres, 690, ft, the, average, flow, rate, in, the, rapids, is, about, 0, 8, 1, 1, metres, per, second, 2, 6, 3, 6, ft, s, the, average, width, along, the, river, is, 400, to, 600, metres, 1, 300, to, 2, 000, ft, the, widest, places, at, 1, 000, to, 1, 250, metres, 3, 280, to, 4, 100, ft, are, in, the, delta, near, the, gates, of, the, marine, trading, port, at, the, end, of, the, ivanovskye, rapids, near, the, confluence, of, the, river, tosna,

the, minimum, of, 4, 0, to, 4, 5, metres, 13, to, 15, ft, is, in, ivanovskye, rapids, in, the, neva, basin, rainfall, greatly, exceeds, evaporation, the, latter, accounts, for, only, 37, 7, percent, of, the, water, consumption, from, the, neva, and, the, remaining, 62, 3, percent, is, water, runoff, since, 1859, the, largest, volume, of, 116, cubic, kilometres, 28, cu, mi, was, observed, in,

than, 48, 300, rivers, however, only, 26, flow, directly, into, neva, the, main, tributaries, are, mga, tosna, izhora, slavyanka, and, murzinka, on, the, left, and, okhta, and, chyornaya, rechka, on, the, right, side, of, neva, the, hydrological, network, had, been, altered, by, the, development, of, saint, petersburg, through, its, entire, history, when, it, was, founded, in, 1703, the, area, was, low, and, swampy, and, required, construction, of, canals, and, ponds, for, drainage, the, earth, excavated, during, their, construction, was, used, to, raise, the, city, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, delta, of, neva, consisted, of, 48, rivers, and, canals, and, 101, islands, the, most, significant, distributaries, of, the, delta, are, listed, in, the, table, before, construction, of, the, obvodny, canal, the, left, tributary, of, that, area, was, the, volkovka, its, part, at, the, confluence, is, now, called, monastyrka, the, ladoga, canal, starts, at, the, root, of, neva, and, connects, it, along, the, southern, coast, of, lake, ladoga, with, the, volkhov, some, canals, of, the, delta, were, filled, over, time, so, that, only, 42, islands, remained, by, 1972,

include, such, undemanding, to, environment, species, as, perch, ruffe, and, roaches, many, fish, species, are, transitory, of, which, commercial, value, have, smelt, vendace, and, partly, salmon, floods, in, st, petersburg, are, usually, caused, by, the, overflow, of, the, delta, of, neva, and, by, surging, water, in, the, eastern, part, of, neva, bay, they, are, registered, when, the, water, rises, above, 160, centimetres, 63, in, with, respect, to, a, gauge, at, the, mining, institute, more, than, 300, floods, occurred, after, the, city, was, founded, in, 1703, three, of, them, were, catastrophic, on, 7, november, 1824, when, water, rose, to, 421, centimetres, 166, in, on, 23, september, 1924, when, it, reached, 369, centimetres, 145, in, and, 10, september, 1777, when, it, rose, to, 321, centimetres, 126, in, however, a, much, larger, flood, of, 760, centimetres, 300, in, was, described, in, 1691, besides, flooding, as, a, result, of, tidal, waves, in, 1903, 1921, and, 1956,
