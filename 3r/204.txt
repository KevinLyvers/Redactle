the, strait, of, gibraltar, is, a, narrow, strait, that, connects, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, mediterranean, sea, and, separates, europe, from, africa, the, two, continents, are, separated, by, 7, 7, nautical, miles, 14, 2, kilometers, 8, 9, miles, at, its, narrowest, point, ferries, cross, between, the, two, continents, every, day, in, as, little, as, 35, minutes, the, strait, s, depth, ranges, between, 300, and, 900, metres, 980, and, 2, 950, feet, 160, and, 490, fathoms, the, strait, lies, in, the, territorial, waters, of, morocco, spain, and, the, british, overseas, territory, of, gibraltar, under, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, law, of, the, sea, foreign, vessels, and, aircraft, have, the, freedom, of, navigation, and, overflight, to, cross, the, strait, of, gibraltar, in, case, of, continuous, transit, the, name, comes, from, the, rock, of, gibraltar, which, in, turn, originates, from, the, arabic, jabal, riq, meaning, tariq, s, mount, named, after, tariq, ibn, ziyad, it, is, also, known, as, the, straits, of, gibraltar, the, gut, of, gibraltar, although, this, is, mostly, archaic, the, strog, strait, of, gibraltar, in, naval, use, another, arabic, name, is, b, b, al, maghrib, arabic, meaning, gate, of, the, west, or, gate, of, the, sunset, and, furthermore, gate, of, the, maghreb, or, gate, of, morocco, in, the, middle, ages, it, was, called, in, arabic, az, zuq, q, the, passage, and, by, the, romans, fretum, gaditanum, strait, of, cadiz, in, latin, it, has, been, called, fretum, herculeum, based, on, the, name, from, antiquity, pillars, of, hercules, ancient, greek, romanized, hai, h, r, kleioi, st, lai, referring, to, the, mountains, as, pillars, such, as, gibraltar, flanking, the, strait, on, the, northern, side, of, the, strait, are, spain, and, gibraltar, a, british, overseas, territory, in, the, iberian, peninsula, on, the, southern, side, are, morocco, and, ceuta, a, spanish, autonomous, city, in, northern, africa, due, to, its, location, the, strait, is, commonly, used, for, illegal, immigration, from, africa, to, europe, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, the, strait, of, gibraltar, as, follows, the, seabed, of, the, strait, is, composed, of, synorogenic, betic, rif, clayey, flysch, covered, by, pliocene, and, or, quaternary, calcareous, sediments, sourced, from, thriving, cold, water, coral, communities, exposed, bedrock, surfaces, coarse, sediments, and, local, sand, dunes, attest, to, the, strong, bottom, current, conditions, at, the, present, time, around, 5, 9, million, years, ago, the, connection, between, the, mediterranean, sea, and, the, atlantic, ocean, along, the, betic, and, rifan, corridor, was, progressively, restricted, until, its, total, closure, effectively, causing, the, salinity, of, the, mediterranean, to, rise, periodically, within, the, gypsum, and, salt, deposition, range, during, what, is, known, as, the, messinian, salinity, crisis, in, this, water, chemistry, environment, dissolved, mineral, concentrations, temperature, and, stilled, water, currents, combined, and, occurred, regularly, to, precipitate, many, mineral, salts, in, layers, on, the, seabed, the, resultant, accumulation, of, various, huge, salt, and, mineral, deposits, about, the, mediterranean, basin, are, directly, linked, to, this, era, it, is, believed, that, this, process, took, a, short, time, by, geological, standards, lasting, between, 500, 000, and, 600, 000, years, it, is, estimated, that, were, the, strait, closed, even, at, today, s, higher, sea, level, most, water, in, the, mediterranean, basin, would, evaporate, within, only, a, thousand, years, as, it, is, believed, to, have, done, then, and, such, an, event, would, lay, down, mineral, deposits, like, the, salt, deposits, now, found, under, the, sea, floor, all, over, the, mediterranean, after, a, lengthy, period, of, restricted, intermittent, or, no, water, exchange, between, the, atlantic, ocean, and, mediterranean, basin, approximately, 5, 33, million, years, ago, the, atlantic, mediterranean, connection, was, completely, reestablished, through, the, strait, of, gibraltar, by, the, zanclean, flood, and, has, remained, open, ever, since, the, erosion, produced, by, the, incoming, waters, seems, to, be, the, main, cause, for, the, present, depth, of, the, strait, 900, m, 3, 000, ft, 490, fathoms, at, the, narrows, 280, m, 920, ft, 150, fathoms, at, the, camarinal, sill, the, strait, is, expected, to, close, again, as, the, african, plate, moves, northward, relative, to, the, eurasian, plate, but, on, geological, rather, than, human, timescales, the, strait, has, been, identified, as, an, important, bird, area, by, birdlife, international, because, of, the, hundreds, of, thousands, of, seabirds, which, use, it, every, year, to, migrate, between, the, mediterranean, and, the, atlantic, including, significant, numbers, of, scopoli, s, and, balearic, shearwaters, audouin, s, and, lesser, black, backed, gulls, razorbills, and, atlantic, puffins, a, resident, orca, pod, of, some, 36, individuals, lives, around, the, strait, one, of, the, few, that, are, left, in, western, european, waters, the, pod, may, be, facing, extinction, in, the, coming, decades, due, to, long, term, effects, of, pcb, pollution, evidence, of, the, first, human, habitation, of, the, area, by, neanderthals, dates, back, to, 125, 000, years, ago, it, is, believed, that, the, rock, of, gibraltar, may, have, been, one, of, the, last, outposts, of, neanderthal, habitation, in, the, world, with, evidence, of, their, presence, there, dating, to, as, recently, as, 24, 000, years, ago, archaeological, evidence, of, homo, sapiens, habitation, of, the, area, dates, back, c, 40, 000, years, the, relatively, short, distance, between, the, two, shores, has, served, as, a, quick, crossing, point, for, various, groups, and, civilizations, throughout, history, including, carthaginians, campaigning, against, rome, romans, travelling, between, the, provinces, of, hispania, and, mauritania, vandals, raiding, south, from, germania, through, western, rome, and, into, north, africa, in, the, 5th, century, moors, and, berbers, in, the, 8th, 11th, centuries, and, spain, and, portugal, in, the, 16th, century, beginning, in, 1492, the, strait, began, to, play, a, certain, cultural, role, in, acting, as, a, barrier, against, cross, channel, conquest, and, the, flow, of, culture, and, language, that, would, naturally, follow, such, a, conquest, in, that, year, the, last, muslim, government, north, of, the, strait, was, overthrown, by, a, spanish, force, since, that, time, the, strait, has, come, to, foster, the, development, of, two, very, distinct, and, varied, cultures, on, either, side, of, it, after, sharing, much, the, same, culture, for, over, 500, years, from, the, 8th, century, to, the, early, 13th, century, on, the, northern, side, christian, european, culture, has, remained, dominant, since, the, expulsion, of, the, last, muslim, kingdom, in, 1492, along, with, the, romance, spanish, language, while, on, the, southern, side, muslim, arabic, mediterranean, has, been, dominant, since, the, spread, of, islam, into, north, africa, in, the, 700s, along, with, the, arabic, language, the, small, british, enclave, of, the, city, of, gibraltar, presents, a, third, cultural, group, found, in, the, strait, this, enclave, was, first, established, in, 1704, and, has, since, been, used, by, the, united, kingdom, to, act, as, a, surety, for, control, of, the, sea, lanes, into, and, out, of, the, mediterranean, following, the, spanish, coup, of, july, 1936, the, spanish, republican, navy, tried, to, blockade, the, strait, of, gibraltar, to, hamper, the, transport, of, army, of, africa, troops, from, spanish, morocco, to, peninsular, spain, on, 5, august, 1936, the, so, called, convoy, de, la, victoria, was, able, to, bring, at, least, 2, 500, men, across, the, strait, breaking, the, republican, blockade, the, strait, is, an, important, shipping, route, from, the, mediterranean, to, the, atlantic, ferries, operate, between, spain, and, morocco, across, the, strait, as, well, as, between, spain, and, ceuta, and, gibraltar, to, tangier, discussion, between, spain, and, morocco, of, a, tunnel, under, the, strait, began, in, the, 1980s, in, december, 2003, both, countries, agreed, to, explore, the, construction, of, an, undersea, rail, tunnel, to, connect, their, rail, systems, across, the, strait, the, gauge, of, the, rail, would, be, 1, 435, mm, 4, ft, 8, 1, 2, in, to, match, the, proposed, construction, and, conversion, of, significant, parts, of, the, existing, broad, gauge, system, to, standard, gauge, while, the, project, remained, in, a, planning, phase, spanish, and, moroccan, officials, met, to, discuss, it, occasionally, including, in, 2012, those, talks, led, to, nothing, constructive, happening, but, in, april, 2021, ministers, from, both, countries, agreed, to, a, joint, intergovernmental, meeting, to, be, held, in, casablanca, in, the, coming, months, this, was, in, order, to, resume, discussions, on, a, tunnel, earlier, in, january, 2021, the, uk, government, had, studied, plans, for, a, tunnel, to, link, gibraltar, with, tangiers, that, would, replace, the, spanish, moroccan, project, that, until, then, had, had, no, tangible, results, after, over, 40, years, of, discussions, the, strait, of, gibraltar, links, the, atlantic, ocean, directly, to, the, mediterranean, sea, this, direct, linkage, creates, certain, unique, flow, and, wave, patterns, these, unique, patterns, are, created, due, to, the, interaction, of, various, regional, and, global, evaporative, forces, water, temperatures, tidal, forces, and, wind, forces, water, flows, through, the, strait, more, or, less, continuously, both, eastwards, and, westwards, a, smaller, amount, of, deeper, saltier, and, therefore, denser, waters, continually, flow, westwards, the, mediterranean, outflow, while, a, larger, amount, of, surface, waters, with, lower, salinity, and, density, continually, flow, eastwards, the, mediterranean, inflow, these, general, flow, tendencies, may, be, occasionally, interrupted, for, brief, periods, by, temporary, tidal, flows, depending, on, various, lunar, and, solar, alignments, the, balance, of, the, water, flow, is, eastwards, since, the, evaporation, rate, within, the, mediterranean, basin, is, higher, than, the, combined, inflow, of, all, the, rivers, that, empty, into, it, plus, the, total, precipitation, of, rain, or, snow, that, falls, on, it, at, the, strait, s, far, western, end, is, the, camarinal, sill, the, strait, s, shallowest, point, which, limits, mixing, between, the, cold, less, saline, atlantic, water, and, the, warmer, more, saline, mediterranean, waters, the, mediterranean, waters, are, so, much, saltier, than, the, atlantic, waters, that, they, sink, below, the, constantly, incoming, water, and, form, a, highly, saline, thermohaline, both, warm, and, salty, layer, of, bottom, water, this, layer, of, bottom, water, constantly, works, its, way, out, into, the, atlantic, as, the, mediterranean, outflow, on, the, atlantic, side, of, the, strait, a, density, boundary, separates, the, mediterranean, outflow, waters, from, the, rest, at, about, 100, m, 330, ft, 55, fathoms, depth, these, waters, flow, out, and, down, the, continental, slope, losing, salinity, until, they, begin, to, mix, and, equilibrate, more, rapidly, much, farther, out, at, a, depth, of, about, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, 550, fathoms, the, mediterranean, outflow, water, layer, can, be, traced, for, thousands, of, kilometres, west, of, the, strait, before, completely, losing, its, identity, during, the, second, world, war, german, u, boats, used, the, currents, to, pass, into, the, mediterranean, sea, without, detection, by, maintaining, silence, with, engines, off, from, september, 1941, to, may, 1944, germany, managed, to, send, 62, u, boats, into, the, mediterranean, all, these, boats, had, to, navigate, the, british, controlled, strait, of, gibraltar, where, nine, u, boats, were, sunk, while, attempting, passage, and, 10, more, had, to, break, off, their, run, due, to, damage, internal, waves, waves, at, the, density, boundary, layer, are, often, produced, by, the, strait, like, traffic, merging, on, a, highway, the, water, flow, is, constricted, in, both, directions, because, it, must, pass, over, the, camarinal, sill, when, large, tidal, flows, enter, the, strait, and, the, high, tide, relaxes, internal, waves, are, generated, at, the, camarinal, sill, and, proceed, eastwards, even, though, the, waves, may, occur, down, to, great, depths, occasionally, the, waves, are, almost, imperceptible, at, the, surface, at, other, times, they, can, be, seen, clearly, in, satellite, imagery, these, internal, waves, continue, to, flow, eastward, and, to, refract, around, coastal, features, they, can, sometimes, be, traced, for, as, much, as, 100, km, 62, mi, 54, nmi, and, sometimes, create, interference, patterns, with, refracted, waves, except, for, its, far, eastern, end, the, strait, lies, within, the, territorial, waters, of, spain, and, morocco, the, united, kingdom, claims, 3, nautical, miles, 5, 6, km, 3, 5, mi, around, gibraltar, on, the, northern, side, of, the, strait, putting, part, of, it, inside, british, territorial, waters, as, this, is, less, than, the, 12, nautical, miles, 22, km, 14, mi, maximum, it, means, according, to, the, british, claim, that, part, of, the, strait, lies, in, international, waters, the, ownership, of, gibraltar, and, its, territorial, waters, is, disputed, by, spain, similarly, morocco, disputes, spanish, sovereignty, over, ceuta, on, the, southern, coast, there, are, several, islets, such, as, the, disputed, isla, perejil, that, are, claimed, by, both, morocco, and, spain, under, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, law, of, the, sea, vessels, passing, through, the, strait, do, so, under, the, regime, of, transit, passage, rather, than, the, more, limited, innocent, passage, allowed, in, most, territorial, waters, therefore, a, vessel, or, aircraft, has, the, freedom, of, navigation, or, overflight, for, the, purpose, of, crossing, the, strait, of, gibraltar, some, studies, have, proposed, the, possibility, of, erecting, tidal, power, generating, stations, within, the, strait, to, be, powered, from, the, predictable, current, at, the, strait, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, the, atlantropa, project, proposed, damming, the, strait, to, generate, large, amounts, of, electricity, and, lower, the, sea, level, of, the, mediterranean, by, several, hundreds, of, meters, to, create, large, new, lands, for, settlement, this, proposal, would, however, have, devastating, effects, on, the, local, climate, and, ecology, and, would, dramatically, change, the, strength, of, the, west, african, monsoon
