suggesting, earlier, european, knowledge, of, the, region, following, sintra, european, traders, established, fortified, posts, engaging, primarily, in, the, slave, trade, which, shaped, the, socio, economic, landscape, significantly, traders, from, europe, such, as, the, dutch, republic, england, and, france, started, to, arrive, in, sierra, leone, and, establish, trading, stations, these, stations, quickly, began, to, primarily, deal, in, slaves, who, were, brought, to, the, coast, by, indigenous, traders, from, interior, areas, undergoing, conflicts, over, territory, the, europeans, made, payments, called, cole, for, rent, tribute, and, trading, rights, to, the, king, of, an, area, local, afro, european, merchants, often, acted, as, middlemen, the, europeans, advancing, them, goods, to, trade, to, indigenous, merchants, most, often, for, slaves, and, ivory, portuguese, traders, were, particularly, drawn, to, the, local, craftsmanship, in, ivory, leading, to, a, notable, trade, in, ivory, artifacts, such, as, horns, sapi, saltceller, and, spoons, the, sapi, people, belonged, to, a, cluster, of, people, who, spoke, west, atlantic, languages, living, in, the, region, of, modern, day, sierra, leone, there, had, already, been, a, carving, culture, established, in, the, area, prior, to, portuguese, contact, and, many, travelers, to, sierra, leone, initially, impressed, with, their, carving, skills, took, local, ivory, horns, back, to, europe, one, notable, description, at, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, by, pacheco, noted, that, in, this, country, they, make, beautiful, mats, of, palm, leaf, and, necklaces, of, ivory, in, this, land, they, make, ivory, necklaces, more, delicately, carved, than, in, any, other, country, also, very, fine, and, beautiful, mats, of, palm, leaf, which, are, call, bicas, very, beautiful, and, good, in, the, late, 18th, century, african, americans, who, had, fought, for, the, british, crown, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, were, resettled, in, sierra, leone, forming, a, community, named, black, loyalists, this, resettlement, scheme, was, partly, motivated, by, social, issues, in, london, with, the, sierra, leone, resettlement, scheme, offering, a, new, beginning, for, the, black, poor, though, it, was, fraught, with, challenges, in, the, late, 18th, century, many, african, americans, claimed, the, protection, of, the, british, crown, there, were, thousands, of, these, black, loyalists, people, of, african, ancestry, who, joined, the, british, military, forces, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, many, had, been, slaves, who, had, escaped, to, join, the, british, lured, by, promises, of, freedom, emancipation, official, documentation, known, as, the, book, of, negroes, lists, thousands, of, freed, slaves, whom, the, british, evacuated, from, the, nascent, united, states, and, resettled, in, colonies, elsewhere, in, british, north, america, pro, slavery, advocates, accused, the, black, poor, of, being, responsible, for, a, large, proportion, of, crime, in, 18th, century, london, while, the, broader, community, included, some, women, the, black, poor, seems, to, have, exclusively, consisted, of, men, some, of, whom, developed, relationships, with, local, women, and, often, married, them, slave, owner, edward, long, criticized, marriage, between, black, men, and, white, women, however, on, the, voyage, between, plymouth, england, and, sierra, leone, 70, european, girlfriends, and, wives, accompanied, the, black, poor, settlers, many, in, london, thought, moving, them, to, sierra, leone, would, lift, them, out, of, poverty, the, sierra, leone, resettlement, scheme, was, proposed, by, entomologist, henry, smeathman, and, drew, interest, from, humanitarians, like, granville, sharp, who, saw, it, as, a, means, of, showing, the, pro, slavery, lobby, that, black, people, could, contribute, towards, the, running, of, the, new, colony, government, officials, soon, became, involved, in, the, scheme, as, well, although, their, interest, was, spurred, by, the, possibility, of, resettling, a, large, group, of, poor, citizens, elsewhere, william, pitt, the, younger, prime, minister, and, leader, of, the, tory, party, had, an, active, interest, in, the, scheme, because, he, saw, it, as, a, means, to, repatriate, the, black, poor, to, africa, since, it, was, necessary, they, should, be, sent, somewhere, and, be, no, longer, suffered, to, infest, the, streets, of, london, in, january, 1787, the, atlantic, and, the, belisarius, set, sail, for, sierra, leone, but, bad, weather, forced, them, to, divert, to, plymouth, during, which, time, about, 50, passengers, died, another, 24, were, discharged, and, 23, ran, away, eventually, with, more, recruitment, 411, passengers, sailed, to, sierra, leone, in, april, 1787, on, the, voyage, between, plymouth, and, sierra, leone, 96, passengers, died, in, 1787, the, british, crown, founded, a, settlement, in, sierra, leone, in, what, was, called, the, province, of, freedom, about, 400, black, and, 60, white, colonists, reached, sierra, leone, on, 15, may, 1787, after, they, established, granville, town, most, of, the, first, group, of, colonists, died, owing, to, disease, and, warfare, with, the, indigenous, african, peoples, temne, who, resisted, their, encroachment, when, the, ships, left, them, in, september, they, had, been, reduced, to, 276, persons, namely, 212, black, men, 30, black, women, 5, white, men, and, 29, white, women, the, settlers, that, remained, forcibly, captured, land, from, a, local, african, chieftain, but, he, retaliated, attacking, the, settlement, which, was, reduced, to, a, mere, 64, settlers, comprising, 39, black, men, 19, black, women, and, six, white, women, black, settlers, were, captured, by, unscrupulous, traders, and, sold, as, slaves, and, the, remaining, colonists, were, forced, to, arm, themselves, for, their, own, protection, the, 64, remaining, colonists, established, a, second, granville, town, following, the, american, revolution, black, loyalists, from, nova, scotia, canada, were, relocated, to, sierra, leone, founding, freetown, and, contributing, significantly, to, the, krio, people, and, krio, language, that, would, come, to, define, the, region, following, the, american, revolution, more, than, 3, 000, black, loyalists, had, also, been, settled, in, nova, scotia, where, they, were, finally, granted, land, they, founded, birchtown, but, faced, harsh, winters, and, racial, discrimination, from, nearby, shelburne, thomas, peters, pressed, british, authorities, for, relief, and, more, aid, together, with, british, abolitionist, john, clarkson, the, sierra, leone, company, was, established, to, relocate, black, loyalists, who, wanted, to, take, their, chances, in, west, africa, in, 1792, nearly, 1, 200, persons, from, nova, scotia, crossed, the, atlantic, to, build, the, second, and, only, permanent, colony, of, sierra, leone, and, the, settlement, of, freetown, on, 11, march, 1792, in, sierra, leone, they, were, called, the, nova, scotian, settlers, the, nova, scotians, or, the, settlers, clarkson, initially, banned, the, survivors, of, granville, town, from, joining, the, new, settlement, blaming, them, for, the, demise, of, granville, town, the, settlers, built, freetown, in, the, styles, they, knew, from, their, lives, in, the, american, south, they, also, continued, american, fashion, and, american, manners, in, addition, many, continued, to, practise, methodism, in, freetown, in, the, 1790s, the, settlers, including, adult, women, voted, for, the, first, time, in, elections, in, 1792, in, a, move, that, foreshadowed, the, women, s, suffrage, movements, in, britain, the, heads, of, all, households, of, which, a, third, were, women, were, given, the, right, to, vote, black, settlers, in, sierra, leone, enjoyed, much, more, autonomy, than, their, white, equivalent, in, european, countries, black, migrants, elected, different, levels, of, political, representatives, tithingmen, who, represented, each, dozen, settlers, and, hundreders, who, represented, larger, amounts, this, sort, of, representation, was, not, available, in, nova, scotia, the, initial, process, of, society, building, in, freetown, was, a, harsh, struggle, the, crown, did, not, supply, enough, basic, supplies, and, provisions, and, the, settlers, were, continually, threatened, by, illegal, slave, trading, and, the, risk, of, re, enslavement, the, sierra, leone, company, controlled, by, london, investors, refused, to, allow, the, settlers, to, take, freehold, of, the, land, in, 1799, some, of, the, settlers, revolted, the, crown, subdued, the, revolt, by, bringing, in, forces, of, more, than, 500, jamaican, maroons, whom, they, transported, from, cudjoe, s, town, trelawny, town, via, nova, scotia, in, 1800, led, by, colonel, montague, james, the, maroons, helped, the, colonial, forces, to, put, down, the, revolt, and, in, the, process, the, jamaican, maroons, in, sierra, leone, secured, the, best, houses, and, farms, on, 1, january, 1808, thomas, ludlam, the, governor, of, the, sierra, leone, company, and, a, leading, abolitionist, surrendered, the, company, s, charter, this, ended, its, 16, years, of, running, the, colony, the, british, crown, reorganised, the, sierra, leone, company, as, the, african, institution, it, was, directed, to, improve, the, local, economy, its, members, represented, both, british, who, hoped, to, inspire, local, entrepreneurs, and, those, with, interest, in, the, macauley, babington, company, which, held, the, british, monopoly, on, sierra, leone, trade, at, about, the, same, time, following, the, slave, trade, act, 1807, which, abolished, the, slave, trade, royal, navy, crews, delivered, thousands, of, formerly, enslaved, africans, to, freetown, after, liberating, them, from, illegal, slave, ships, these, liberated, africans, or, recaptives, were, sold, for, 20, a, head, as, apprentices, to, the, white, settlers, nova, scotian, settlers, and, the, jamaican, maroons, many, liberated, africans, were, treated, poorly, and, even, abused, because, some, of, the, original, settlers, considered, them, their, property, cut, off, from, their, various, homelands, and, traditions, the, liberated, africans, were, forced, to, assimilate, to, the, western, styles, of, settlers, and, maroons, for, example, some, of, the, liberated, africans, were, forced, to, change, their, name, to, a, more, western, sounding, one, though, some, people, happily, embraced, these, changes, because, they, considered, it, as, being, part, of, the, community, some, were, not, happy, with, these, changes, and, wanted, to, keep, their, own, identity, many, liberated, africans, were, so, unhappy, that, they, risked, the, possibility, of, being, sold, back, into, slavery, by, leaving, sierra, leone, and, going, back, to, their, original, villages, the, liberated, africans, eventually, modified, their, customs, to, adopt, those, of, the, nova, scotians, maroons, and, europeans, yet, kept, some, of, their, ethnic, traditions, as, the, liberated, africans, became, successful, traders, and, spread, christianity, throughout, west, africa, they, intermarried, with, the, nova, scotians, and, maroons, and, the, two, groups, eventually, became, a, fusion, of, african, and, western, societies, 3, 4, 223, 255, these, liberated, africans, were, from, many, areas, of, africa, but, principally, the, west, coast, between, the, 18th, and, 19th, century, freed, african, americans, some, americo, liberian, refugees, and, particularly, afro, caribbeans, mainly, jamaican, maroons, also, immigrated, and, settled, in, freetown, together, these, peoples, formed, the, creole, krio, ethnicity, and, an, english, based, creole, language, krio, which, is, the, lingua, franca, and, de, facto, national, language, used, among, many, of, the, ethnicities, in, the, country, the, colonial, era, saw, sierra, leone, evolving, under, british, rule, with, a, unique, settlement, pattern, composed, of, displaced, africans, following, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, sierra, leone, developed, as, an, educational, center, in, west, africa, with, the, establishment, of, fourah, bay, college, in, 1827, attracting, english, speaking, africans, from, across, the, region, the, settlement, of, sierra, leone, in, the, 1800s, was, unique, in, that, the, population, was, composed, of, displaced, africans, brought, to, the, colony, after, the, british, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, in, 1807, upon, arrival, in, sierra, leone, each, recaptive, was, given, a, registration, number, and, information, on, their, physical, qualities, would, be, entered, into, the, register, of, liberated, africans, often, documentation, would, be, subjective, and, result, in, inaccurate, entries, making, them, difficult, to, track, differences, between, the, register, of, liberated, africans, of, 1808, and, the, list, of, captured, negroes, of, 1812, which, emulated, the, 1808, document, revealed, disparities, in, the, entries, specifically, in, the, names, many, recaptives, decided, to, change, their, given, names, to, anglicised, versions, which, contributed, to, the, difficulty, in, tracking, them, after, they, arrived, in, the, early, 19th, century, freetown, served, as, the, residence, of, the, british, colonial, governor, of, the, region, who, also, administered, the, gold, coast, now, ghana, and, the, gambia, settlements, sierra, leone, developed, as, the, educational, centre, of, british, west, africa, the, british, established, fourah, bay, college, in, 1827, which, became, a, magnet, for, english, speaking, africans, on, the, west, coast, for, more, than, a, century, it, was, the, only, european, style, university, in, west, sub, saharan, africa, samuel, ajayi, crowther, was, the, first, student, to, be, enrolled, fourah, bay, college, soon, drew, creoles, krio, people, and, other, africans, seeking, higher, education, in, british, west, africa, these, included, nigerians, ghanaians, ivorians, and, others, especially, in, the, fields, of, theology, and, education, freetown, was, known, as, the, athens, of, africa, due, to, the, number, of, excellent, schools, in, freetown, and, surrounding, areas, the, british, interacted, mostly, with, the, krio, people, in, freetown, who, did, most, of, the, trading, with, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, interior, educated, krio, people, held, numerous, positions, in, the, colonial, government, giving, them, status, and, well, paying, positions, following, the, berlin, conference, of, 1884, 85, the, british, decided, they, needed, to, establish, more, dominion, over, the, inland, areas, to, satisfy, what, was, described, by, the, european, powers, as, effective, occupation, in, 1896, it, annexed, these, areas, declaring, them, the, sierra, leone, protectorate, with, this, change, the, british, began, to, expand, their, administration, in, the, region, recruiting, british, citizens, to, posts, and, pushing, krio, people, out, of, positions, in, government, and, even, the, desirable, residential, areas, in, freetown, during, the, british, annexation, in, sierra, leone, chiefs, in, the, north, and, south, of, the, country, resisted, the, hut, tax, imposed, by, the, colonial, administrators, in, the, north, there, was, a, limba, chief, named, almamy, suluku, fighting, to, protect, his, territory, while, using, diplomacy, to, trick, the, protectorate, administrators, and, sending, fighters, to, assist, bai, bureh, a, prominent, temne, chief, in, kasseh, who, was, fighting, against, the, hut, tax, the, war, was, later, known, as, the, hut, tax, war, of, 1898, madam, yoko, c, 1849, 1906, was, a, woman, of, culture, and, ambition, she, employed, her, capacity, for, friendly, communications, to, persuade, the, british, to, give, her, control, of, the, kpaa, mende, chiefdom, she, used, diplomacy, to, communicate, with, local, chiefs, who, did, not, trust, her, friendship, with, the, british, because, madam, yoko, supported, the, british, some, sub, chiefs, rebelled, causing, yoko, to, take, refuge, in, the, police, barracks, for, her, loyalty, she, was, awarded, a, silver, medal, by, queen, victoria, until, 1906, madam, yoko, ruled, as, a, paramount, chief, in, the, new, british, protectorate, the, british, annexation, of, the, protectorate, interfered, with, the, sovereignty, of, indigenous, chiefs, they, designated, chiefs, as, units, of, local, government, rather, than, dealing, with, them, individually, as, had, been, the, previous, practice, they, did, not, maintain, relationships, even, with, longstanding, allies, such, as, bai, bureh, who, was, later, unfairly, portrayed, as, a, prime, instigator, of, the, hut, tax, war, colonel, frederic, cardew, military, governor, of, the, protectorate, in, 1898, established, a, new, tax, on, dwellings, and, demanded, that, the, chiefs, use, their, people, to, maintain, roads, the, taxes, were, often, higher, than, the, value, of, the, dwellings, and, 24, chiefs, signed, a, petition, to, cardew, stating, how, destructive, this, was, their, people, could, not, afford, to, take, time, off, from, their, subsistence, agriculture, they, resisted, payment, of, taxes, tensions, over, the, new, colonial, requirements, and, the, administration, s, suspicions, towards, the, chiefs, led, to, the, hut, tax, the, british, fired, first, the, northern, front, of, mainly, temne, people, was, led, by, bai, bureh, the, southern, front, consisting, mostly, of, mende, people, entered, the, conflict, somewhat, later, for, other, reasons, for, several, months, bureh, s, fighters, had, the, advantage, over, the, vastly, more, powerful, british, forces, but, both, sides, suffered, hundreds, of, fatalities, bureh, surrendered, on, 11, november, 1898, to, end, the, destruction, of, his, people, s, territory, and, dwellings, although, the, british, government, recommended, leniency, cardew, insisted, on, sending, the, chief, and, two, allies, into, exile, in, the, gold, coast, his, government, hanged, 96, of, the, chief, s, warriors, bureh, was, allowed, to, return, in, 1905, when, he, resumed, his, chieftaincy, of, kasseh, the, defeat, of, the, temne, and, mende, in, the, hut, tax, war, ended, mass, resistance, to, the, protectorate, and, colonial, government, but, intermittent, rioting, and, labour, unrest, continued, throughout, the, colonial, period, riots, in, 1955, and, 1956, involved, tens, of, thousands, of, sierra, leoneans, in, the, protectorate, domestic, slavery, which, continued, to, be, practised, by, local, african, elites, was, abolished, in, 1928, a, notable, event, in, 1935, was, the, granting, of, a, monopoly, on, mineral, mining, to, the, sierra, leone, selection, trust, run, by, de, beers, the, monopoly, was, scheduled, to, last, 98, years, mining, of, diamonds, in, the, east, and, other, minerals, expanded, drawing, labourers, there, from, other, parts, of, the, country, in, 1924, the, uk, government, divided, the, administration, of, sierra, leone, into, colony, and, protectorate, with, different, political, systems, for, each, the, colony, was, freetown, and, its, coastal, area, the, protectorate, was, defined, as, the, hinterland, areas, dominated, by, local, chiefs, antagonism, between, the, two, entities, escalated, to, a, heated, debate, in, 1947, when, proposals, were, introduced, to, provide, for, a, single, political, system, for, both, the, colony, and, the, protectorate, most, proposals, came, from, leaders, of, the, protectorate, whose, population, far, outnumbered, that, in, the, colony, the, krios, led, by, isaac, wallace, johnson, opposed,

provided, energy, to, less, than, 5, of, the, target, population, part, of, the, reason, for, this, was, due, to, the, import, duties, and, taxes, and, the, lack, of, quality, control, to, ensure, that, the, energy, africa, goal, is, met, sierra, leone, has, agreed, to, remove, its, import, duties, and, value, added, tax, vat, on, certified, solar, products, this, change, will, attempt, to,
