bass, strait, b, s, is, a, strait, separating, the, island, state, of, tasmania, from, the, australian, mainland, more, specifically, the, coast, of, victoria, with, the, exception, of, the, land, border, across, boundary, islet, the, strait, provides, the, most, direct, waterway, between, the, great, australian, bight, and, the, tasman, sea, and, is, also, the, only, maritime, route, into, the, economically, prominent, port, phillip, bay, formed, 8, 000, years, ago, by, rising, sea, levels, at, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, the, strait, was, named, after, english, explorer, and, physician, george, bass, 1771, 1803, by, european, colonists, the, international, hydrographic, organization, defines, the, limits, of, bass, strait, as, follows, some, authorities, consider, the, strait, to, be, part, of, the, pacific, ocean, as, in, the, never, approved, 2002, iho, limits, of, oceans, and, seas, draft, in, the, currently, in, force, iho, 1953, draft, it, is, instead, associated, with, the, great, australian, bight, the, bight, is, numbered, 62, while, the, bass, strait, is, designated, 62, a, the, australian, hydrographic, service, does, not, consider, it, to, be, part, of, its, expanded, definition, of, the, southern, ocean, but, rather, states, that, it, lies, with, the, tasman, sea, the, strait, between, the, furneaux, islands, and, tasmania, is, banks, strait, a, subdivision, of, bass, strait, aboriginal, tasmanians, arrived, in, tasmania, approximately, 40, 000, years, ago, during, the, last, glacial, period, across, a, broad, prehistoric, land, bridge, called, the, bassian, plain, between, the, nowaday, southern, victoria, coastline, from, wilsons, promontory, to, cape, otway, and, the, northern, tasmanian, shores, from, cape, portland, to, cape, grim, after, the, glacial, period, ended, sea, levels, rose, and, flooded, the, bassian, plain, to, form, bass, strait, at, around, 8, 000, years, ago, leaving, them, isolated, from, the, australian, mainland, aboriginal, people, lived, on, flinders, island, until, around, 4, 000, years, ago, based, on, the, recorded, language, groups, there, were, at, least, three, successive, waves, of, aboriginal, colonisation, the, strait, was, possibly, detected, by, captain, abel, tasman, when, he, charted, tasmania, s, coast, in, 1642, on, 5, december, tasman, was, following, the, east, coast, northward, to, see, how, far, it, went, when, the, land, veered, to, the, north, west, at, eddystone, point, he, tried, to, keep, in, with, it, but, his, ships, were, suddenly, hit, by, the, roaring, forties, howling, through, bass, strait, tasman, was, on, a, mission, to, find, the, southern, continent, not, more, islands, so, he, abruptly, turned, away, to, the, east, and, continued, his, continent, hunting, the, next, european, to, approach, the, strait, was, captain, james, cook, in, the, endeavour, in, april, 1770, however, after, sailing, for, two, hours, westward, towards, the, strait, against, the, wind, he, turned, back, east, and, noted, in, his, journal, that, he, was, doubtful, whether, they, are, one, land, or, no, the, strait, was, named, after, george, bass, after, he, and, matthew, flinders, sailed, across, it, while, circumnavigating, van, diemen, s, land, now, named, tasmania, in, the, norfolk, in, 1798, 99, at, flinders, recommendation, the, governor, of, new, south, wales, john, hunter, in, 1800, named, the, stretch, of, water, between, the, mainland, and, van, diemen, s, land, bass, s, straits, in, 1798, it, became, known, as, bass, strait, the, existence, of, the, strait, had, been, suggested, in, 1797, by, the, master, of, sydney, cove, when, he, reached, sydney, after, deliberately, grounding, his, foundering, ship, and, being, stranded, on, preservation, island, at, the, eastern, end, of, the, strait, he, reported, that, the, strong, south, westerly, swell, and, the, tides, and, currents, suggested, that, the, island, was, in, a, channel, linking, the, pacific, and, southern, indian, ocean, governor, hunter, thus, wrote, to, joseph, banks, in, august, 1797, that, it, seemed, certain, a, strait, existed, when, news, of, the, 1798, discovery, of, bass, strait, reached, europe, the, french, government, despatched, a, reconnaissance, expedition, commanded, by, nicolas, baudin, this, prompted, governor, king, to, send, two, vessels, from, sydney, to, the, island, to, establish, a, garrison, at, hobart, strong, currents, between, the, antarctic, driven, southeast, portions, of, the, indian, ocean, and, the, tasman, sea, s, pacific, ocean, waters, provide, a, strait, of, powerful, wild, storm, waves, the, shipwrecks, on, the, tasmanian, and, victorian, coastlines, number, in, the, hundreds, although, stronger, metal, ships, and, modern, marine, navigation, have, greatly, reduced, the, danger, many, vessels, some, quite, large, have, disappeared, without, a, trace, or, left, scant, evidence, of, their, passing, despite, myths, and, legends, of, piracy, wrecking, and, alleged, supernatural, phenomena, akin, to, those, of, the, bermuda, triangle, such, disappearances, can, be, invariably, ascribed, to, treacherous, combinations, of, wind, and, sea, conditions, and, the, numerous, semi, submerged, rocks, and, reefs, within, the, straits, despite, the, strait, s, difficult, waters, it, provided, a, safer, and, less, boisterous, passage, for, ships, on, the, route, from, europe, or, india, to, sydney, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, strait, also, saved, 1, 300, km, 700, nmi, on, the, voyage, bass, strait, is, approximately, 250, km, 160, mi, wide, and, 500, km, 310, mi, long, with, an, average, depth, of, 60, m, 200, ft, the, widest, opening, is, about, 350, km, 220, mi, between, cape, portland, on, the, northeastern, tip, of, tasmania, and, point, hicks, on, the, australian, mainland, jennings, study, of, the, submarine, topography, of, bass, strait, described, the, bathymetric, bass, basin, a, shallow, depression, approximately, 120, km, 70, mi, wide, and, 400, km, 250, mi, long, over, 65, 000, km, 2, in, area, in, the, centre, of, bass, strait, a, maximum, depth, is, the, channel, between, inner, sister, island, and, flinders, island, which, navigation, charts, indicate, reaches, 155, m, 510, ft, two, underwater, plateaus, the, bassian, rise, and, king, island, rise, located, on, the, eastern, and, western, margins, of, bass, strait, respectively, are, composed, of, a, basement, of, paleozoic, granite, these, features, form, sills, separating, bass, basin, from, the, adjacent, ocean, basins, associated, with, the, less, than, 50, m, 160, ft, deep, bassian, rise, is, the, furneaux, islands, the, largest, of, which, is, flinders, island, maximum, elevation, 760, m, the, surface, of, the, king, island, rise, also, occurs, in, water, depths, of, less, than, 50, m, 160, ft, and, includes, the, shallow, 40, m, tail, bank, at, its, northern, margin, as, well, as, king, island, itself, subaqueous, dunes, sandwaves, and, tidal, current, ridges, cover, approximately, 6, 000, km, 2, 2, 300, sq, mi, of, the, seabed, in, bass, strait, during, pleistocene, low, sea, level, stands, the, central, basin, of, bass, strait, was, enclosed, by, raised, sills, forming, a, large, shallow, lake, this, occurred, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, 18, 000, bp, when, the, basin, was, completely, isolated, sea, level, rise, during, the, marine, transgression, flooded, the, basin, forming, a, westward, embayment, from, 11, 800, bp, to, 8700, bp, and, the, basin, rim, was, completely, flooded, by, about, 8000, bp, at, which, point, bass, strait, was, formed, and, tasmania, became, an, isolated, island, like, the, rest, of, the, waters, surrounding, tasmania, and, particularly, because, of, its, limited, depth, it, is, notoriously, rough, with, many, ships, lost, there, during, the, 19th, century, a, lighthouse, was, erected, on, deal, island, in, 1848, to, assist, ships, navigating, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, straits, but, there, were, no, guides, to, the, western, entrance, until, the, cape, otway, lighthouse, was, first, lit, in, 1848, followed, by, another, at, cape, wickham, at, the, northern, end, of, king, island, in, 1861, there, are, over, 50, islands, in, bass, strait, major, islands, include, western, section, south, eastern, section, north, eastern, section, within, bass, strait, there, are, several, commonwealth, marine, reserves, which, are, all, part, of, the, south, east, network, the, two, larger, reserves, flinders, and, zeehan, extend, mostly, outside, of, the, bass, strait, area, the, smaller, islands, of, bass, strait, typically, have, some, form, of, protection, status, most, notably, the, kent, group, national, park, covers, the, kent, group, islands, of, tasmania, as, well, as, the, surrounding, state, waters, which, is, a, dedicated, marine, reserve, the, national, park, is, wholly, contained, by, the, beagle, commonwealth, marine, reserve, victoria, has, several, marine, national, parks, in, bass, strait, and, are, all, adjacent, to, the, mainland, coastline, a, number, of, oil, and, gas, fields, exist, in, the, eastern, portion, of, bass, strait, in, what, is, known, as, the, gippsland, basin, most, large, fields, were, discovered, in, the, 1960s, and, are, located, about, 50, to, 65, km, 30, to, 40, mi, off, the, coast, of, gippsland, in, water, depths, of, about, 70, m, 230, ft, 484, these, oil, fields, include, the, halibut, field, discovered, in, 1967, the, cobia, field, discovered, in, 1972, the, kingfish, field, the, mackerel, field, and, the, fortescue, field, discovered, in, 1978, 484, large, gas, fields, include, the, whiptail, field, the, barracouta, field, the, snapper, field, and, the, marlin, field, 484, oil, and, gas, are, produced, from, the, cretaceous, eocene, clastic, rocks, of, the, latrobe, group, deposited, with, the, break, up, of, australia, and, antarctica, 485, in, 2020, activist, group, no, gas, across, the, bass, was, set, up, after, american, company, conocophillips, put, in, an, application, to, seismic, blast, 27km, from, king, island, further, environmental, campaigning, followed, the, australian, government, s, 2020, oil, and, gas, acreage, release, as, this, opened, up, new, areas, of, tasmania, s, oceans, for, exploration, the, western, field, known, as, the, otway, basin, was, discovered, in, the, 1990s, offshore, near, port, campbell, its, exploitation, began, in, 2005, the, oil, and, gas, is, sent, via, pipeline, to, gas, processing, facilities, and, oil, refineries, at, longford, longford, gas, plant, western, port, westernport, refinery, closed, 1985, altona, altona, refinery, scheduled, to, close, in, 2021, and, geelong, geelong, oil, refinery, as, well, as, by, tanker, to, new, south, wales, pipelines, from, the, otway, basin, gas, fields, lead, to, several, processing, facilities, in, the, vicinity, of, port, campbell, iona, gas, plant, and, otway, gas, plant, in, june, 2017, the, government, of, victoria, announced, a, three, year, feasibility, study, for, australia, s, first, offshore, wind, farm, the, project, which, could, have, 250, wind, turbines, within, a, 574, km, 2, 222, sq, mi, area, is, projected, to, deliver, around, 8, 000, gwh, of, electricity, representing, some, 18, per, cent, of, victoria, s, power, usage, and, replacing, a, large, part, of, the, output, of, hazelwood, power, station, which, was, closed, in, early, 2017, the, fastest, and, often, the, cheapest, method, of, travel, across, bass, strait, is, by, air, the, major, airports, in, tasmania, are, hobart, airport, and, launceston, airport, where, the, main, airlines, are, jetstar, and, virgin, australia, qantas, also, operates, services, the, smaller, airports, in, the, north, of, the, state, and, on, the, islands, in, the, strait, are, served, either, by, rex, airlines, qantaslink, or, king, island, airlines, the, domestic, sea, route, is, serviced, by, two, spirit, of, tasmania, passenger, vehicle, ferries, based, in, devonport, tasmania, the, ships, travel, daily, between, devonport, and, spirit, of, tasmania, quay, in, geelong, as, overnight, trips, with, additional, daytime, trips, during, the, peak, summer, season, the, basslink, hvdc, electrical, cable, has, been, in, service, since, 2006, it, has, the, capacity, to, carry, up, to, 630, megawatts, of, electrical, power, across, the, strait, alinta, owns, a, submarine, gas, pipeline, delivering, natural, gas, to, large, industrial, customers, near, george, town, as, well, as, the, powerco, gas, network, in, tasmania, the, first, submarine, communications, cable, across, bass, strait, was, laid, in, 1859, starting, at, cape, otway, victoria, it, went, via, king, island, and, three, hummock, island, made, contact, with, the, tasmanian, mainland, at, stanley, head, and, then, continued, on, to, george, town, however, it, started, failing, within, a, few, weeks, of, completion, and, by, 1861, it, failed, completely, tasmania, is, currently, connected, to, the, mainland, via, two, telstra, operated, fibre, optic, cables, since, 2006, dark, fibre, capacity, has, also, been, available, on, the, basslink, hvdc, cable, other, submarine, cables, include, in, 1978, one, of, the, most, famous, ufo, incidents, in, australian, history, occurred, over, bass, strait, frederick, valentich, was, flying, a, small, aeroplane, over, the, strait, when, he, reported, to, personnel, at, a, local, airport, that, a, strange, object, was, buzzing, his, plane, he, then, claimed, that, the, object, had, moved, directly, in, front, of, his, plane, the, airport, personnel, then, heard, a, metallic, scraping, sound, followed, by, silence, valentich, and, his, plane, subsequently, vanished, and, neither, valentich, nor, his, plane, were, ever, seen, again, the, issue, of, planes, ships, and, people, having, been, lost, in, the, strait, over, time, has, spawned, a, number, of, theories, perhaps, the, most, thorough, list, of, losses, and, disappearances, has, been, the, oft, reprinted, book, of, jack, loney, though, it, is, possible, that, most, losses, can, be, adequately, explained, by, extreme, weather, events, on, the, popular, australian, soap, neighbours, one, of, its, most, dramatic, storylines, unfolded, when, a, 1940s, themed, joy, flight, to, tasmania, was, sabotaged, by, a, bomb, the, plane, crashed, into, bass, strait, in, the, middle, of, the, night, and, many, character, s, lives, were, put, at, risk, with, some, drowning, bass, strait, is, regularly, crossed, by, sailing, vessels, including, during, the, annual, melbourne, to, hobart, yacht, race, the, sydney, to, hobart, yacht, race, passes, generally, east, of, the, strait, but, is, affected, by, its, weather, conditions, the, first, windsurfer, crossing, was, in, 1982, by, mark, paul, and, les, tokolyi, in, 1998, australian, offshore, sailor, nick, moloney, took, on, a, different, challenge, by, being, the, first, person, to, windsurf, unaided, across, the, bass, strait, in, a, time, of, 22, hours, in, terms, of, dinghy, sailing, many, crossings, have, been, made, but, in, march, 2005, australian, olympic, medallist, michael, blackburn, set, a, record, when, he, crossed, the, strait, in, just, over, 13, hours, in, a, laser, sailing, dinghy, in, march, 2009, two, young, dinghy, sailors, sailed, a, b14, dinghy, from, stanley, in, north, west, tasmania, to, walkerville, south, in, victoria, the, purpose, of, the, voyage, was, to, raise, funds, for, the, treatment, of, the, endangered, tasmanian, devil, an, animal, species, suffering, from, a, facial, tumour, disease, and, if, possible, break, the, dinghy, sailing, time, record, for, the, crossing, the, sailors, adrian, beswick, and, josh, philips, accompanied, by, a, support, vessel, successfully, completed, the, crossing, in, 14, hours, 53, minutes, kitesurfers, have, also, completed, the, crossing, with, natalie, clark, in, 2010, become, the, first, female, to, do, the, crossing, in, 1971, lone, rower, david, bowen, from, mount, martha, crossed, bass, strait, in, a, 6, 1, m, 20, ft, dory, leaving, from, devonport, he, landed, on, wilson, s, promontory, the, first, crossing, by, paddleboard, was, made, by, jack, bark, brad, gaul, and, zeb, walsh, leaving, wilsons, promontory, in, victoria, on, 25, february, 2014, and, arriving, at, cape, portland, in, northeastern, tasmania, on, 4, march, 2014, rod, harris, ian, and, peter, richards, are, credited, with, the, first, kayak, crossing, in, 1971, many, sea, kayakers, have, since, made, the, crossing, usually, by, island, hopping, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, strait, fewer, sea, kayak, crossings, have, been, made, via, king, island, due, to, the, 100, km, 60, mi, leg, between, cape, wickam, and, apollo, bay, andrew, mcauley, was, the, first, person, to, cross, bass, strait, non, stop, in, a, sea, kayak, in, 2003, he, made, two, more, crossings, of, bass, strait, before, he, died, attempting, to, cross, the, tasman, sea, in, february, 2007, tammy, van, wisse, swam, part, of, the, strait, in, 1996, from, king, island, to, apollo, bay, in, victoria, a, distance, of, about, 100, km, 60, mi, in, 17, hours, and, 46, minutes
