st, peter, was, built, nearby, remains, of, this, ancient, necropolis, were, brought, to, light, sporadically, during, renovations, by, various, popes, throughout, the, centuries, increasing, in, frequency, during, the, renaissance, until, it, was, systematically, excavated, by, orders, of, pope, pius, xii, from, 1939, to, 1941, the, constantinian, basilica, was, built, in, 326, over, what, was, believed, to, be, the, tomb, of, saint, peter, buried, in, that, cemetery, from, then, on, the, land, mass, became, more, populated, in, connection, with, activity, at, the, basilica, a, palace, was, constructed, nearby, as, early, as, the, 5th, century, during, the, pontificate, of, pope, symmachus, reigned, 498, 514, popes, gradually, came, to, have, a, secular, role, as, governors, of, regions, near, rome, they, ruled, the, papal, states, which, covered, a, large, portion, of, the, italian, peninsula, for, more, than, a, thousand, years, until, the, mid, 19th, century, when, all, the, territory, belonging, to, the, papacy, was, seized, by, the, newly, created, kingdom, of, italy, for, most, of, this, time, the, popes, did, not, live, at, the, vatican, the, lateran, palace, on, the, opposite, side, of, rome, was, their, habitual, residence, for, about, a, thousand, years, from, 1309, to, 1377, they, lived, at, avignon, in, france, on, their, return, to, rome, they, chose, to, live, at, the, vatican, they, moved, to, the, quirinal, palace, in, 1583, after, work, on, it, was, completed, under, pope, paul, v, 1605, 1621, but, on, the, capture, of, rome, in, 1870, retired, to, the, vatican, and, what, had, been, their, residence, became, that, of, the, king, of, italy, in, 1870, the, pope, s, holdings, were, left, in, an, uncertain, situation, when, rome, itself, was, annexed, by, italian, forces, thus, bringing, to, completion, the, italian, unification, after, a, nominal, resistance, by, the, papal, forces, between, 1861, and, 1929, the, status, of, the, pope, was, referred, to, as, the, roman, question, italy, made, no, attempt, to, interfere, with, the, holy, see, within, the, vatican, walls, however, it, confiscated, church, property, in, many, places, in, 1871, the, quirinal, palace, was, confiscated, by, the, king, of, italy, and, became, the, royal, palace, thereafter, the, popes, resided, undisturbed, within, the, vatican, walls, and, certain, papal, prerogatives, were, recognised, by, the, law, of, guarantees, including, the, right, to, send, and, receive, ambassadors, but, the, popes, did, not, recognise, the, italian, king, s, right, to, rule, in, rome, and, they, refused, to, leave, the, vatican, compound, until, the, dispute, was, resolved, in, 1929, pope, pius, ix, 1846, 1878, the, last, ruler, of, the, papal, states, was, referred, to, as, a, prisoner, in, the, vatican, forced, to, give, up, secular, power, the, popes, focused, on, spiritual, issues, this, situation, was, resolved, on, 11, february, 1929, when, the, lateran, treaty, between, the, holy, see, and, the, kingdom, of, italy, was, signed, by, prime, minister, and, head, of, government, benito, mussolini, on, behalf, of, king, victor, emmanuel, iii, and, by, cardinal, secretary, of, state, pietro, gasparri, for, pope, pius, xi, the, treaty, which, became, effective, on, 7, june, 1929, established, the, independent, state, of, vatican, city, and, reaffirmed, the, special, status, of, catholic, christianity, in, italy, the, holy, see, which, governed, the, vatican, city, pursued, a, policy, of, neutrality, during, world, war, ii, under, the, leadership, of, pope, pius, xii, although, german, troops, occupied, rome, after, the, september, 1943, armistice, of, cassibile, with, allied, forces, pushing, them, out, in, 1944, both, sides, respected, the, vatican, city, s, status, as, neutral, territory, one, of, the, main, diplomatic, priorities, of, pius, xii, was, to, prevent, the, bombing, of, the, city, a, high, level, of, sensitivity, led, him, to, protest, even, the, dropping, of, pamphlets, over, rome, by, the, royal, air, force, claiming, that, the, few, which, landed, within, the, vatican, city, violated, its, neutrality, the, british, government, s, policy, towards, the, vatican, as, expressed, in, the, minutes, of, a, cabinet, meeting, was, that, we, should, on, no, account, molest, the, vatican, city, but, that, our, action, as, regards, the, rest, of, rome, would, depend, upon, how, far, the, italian, government, observed, the, rules, of, war, after, the, united, states, entered, into, the, war, us, officials, were, against, bombing, the, vatican, city, fearful, of, offending, catholic, members, of, the, american, military, but, said, that, they, could, not, stop, the, british, from, bombing, rome, if, the, british, so, decided, the, us, military, even, exempted, catholic, servicemembers, from, air, raids, on, rome, and, other, areas, with, a, significant, catholic, presence, unless, they, voluntarily, agreed, to, participate, notably, with, the, exception, of, rome, and, presumably, the, possibility, of, the, vatican, no, catholic, us, servicemember, refused, a, mission, within, german, held, italy, on, the, other, hand, the, british, insisted, they, would, bomb, rome, whenever, the, needs, of, the, war, demanded, in, december, 1942, the, british, envoy, to, the, holy, see, suggested, that, rome, be, declared, an, open, city, a, suggestion, that, the, holy, see, took, more, seriously, than, was, probably, meant, by, the, envoy, who, did, not, want, rome, to, be, an, open, city, but, mussolini, rejected, the, suggestion, when, the, holy, see, put, it, to, him, in, connection, with, the, allied, invasion, of, sicily, 500, united, states, army, air, forces, aircraft, bombed, rome, on, 19, july, 1943, targeting, the, city, s, railway, hub, in, particular, approximately, 1, 500, people, were, killed, and, pius, xii, who, had, been, described, in, the, previous, month, as, worried, sick, about, the, possibility, of, rome, being, bombed, toured, the, affected, areas, another, allied, bombing, raid, took, place, on, 13, august, 1943, after, mussolini, had, been, ousted, from, power, on, the, following, day, the, new, italian, government, declared, rome, an, open, city, after, consulting, the, holy, see, on, the, wording, of, the, declaration, pius, xii, had, refrained, from, creating, cardinals, during, the, war, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, there, were, several, prominent, vacancies, cardinal, secretary, of, state, camerlengo, chancellor, and, prefect, for, the, congregation, for, the, religious, among, them, pius, xii, created, 32, cardinals, in, early, 1946, having, announced, his, intention, to, do, so, in, his, preceding, christmas, message, the, pontifical, military, corps, except, for, the, swiss, guard, was, disbanded, by, the, will, of, paul, vi, as, expressed, in, a, letter, of, 14, september, 1970, the, gendarmerie, corps, was, transformed, into, a, civilian, police, and, security, force, in, 1984, a, new, concordat, between, the, holy, see, and, italy, modified, certain, provisions, of, the, earlier, treaty, including, the, position, of, catholic, christianity, as, the, italian, state, religion, a, position, given, to, it, by, a, statute, of, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, of, 1848, construction, in, 1995, of, a, new, guest, house, domus, sanctae, marthae, adjacent, to, st, peter, s, basilica, was, criticized, by, italian, environmental, groups, backed, by, italian, politicians, they, claimed, the, new, building, would, block, views, of, the, basilica, from, nearby, italian, apartments, for, a, short, while, the, plans, strained, the, relations, between, the, vatican, and, the, italian, government, the, head, of, the, vatican, s, department, of, technical, services, robustly, rejected, challenges, to, the, vatican, state, s, right, to, build, within, its, borders, john, r, morss, writes, in, the, european, journal, of, international, law, that, due, to, the, terms, of, the, lateran, treaty, vatican, city, s, status, as, a, sovereign, state, and, the, pope, s, status, as, a, head, of, state, are, problematic, the, name, vatican, was, already, in, use, in, the, time, of, the, roman, republic, for, the, ager, vaticanus, a, marshy, area, on, the, west, bank, of, the,
