instituted, in, seville, in, 1478, its, primary, charge, was, to, ensure, that, all, nominal, christians, were, really, behaving, like, christians, and, not, practicing, what, judaism, they, could, in, secret, at, first, the, activity, of, the, inquisition, was, limited, to, the, dioceses, of, seville, and, c, rdoba, where, the, dominican, friar, alonso, de, ojeda, had, detected, converso, activity, the, first, auto, de, f, took, place, in, seville, on, 6, february, 1481, when, six, people, were, burned, alive, alonso, de, ojeda, himself, gave, the, sermon, the, inquisition, then, grew,

indies, unlike, other, harbors, reaching, the, port, of, seville, required, sailing, about, 80, kilometres, 50, mi, up, the, river, guadalquivir, the, choice, of, seville, was, made, in, spite, of, the, difficulties, for, navigation, in, the, guadalquivir, stemming, from, the, increasing, tonnage, of, ships, as, a, result, of, the, relentless, drive, to, make, maritime, transport, cheaper, during, the, late, middle, ages, nevertheless, technical, suitability, issues, notwithstanding, the, choice, was, still, reasonable, in, the, sense, that, seville, had, become, the, largest, demographic, economic, and, financial, centre, of, christian, andalusia, in, the, late, middle, ages, in, addition, factors, favouring, the, choice, of, seville, include, the, andalusian, coastline, being, largely, under, the, seigneurial, control, of, the, house, of, medina, sidonia, seville, enjoying, an, important, hinterland, and, administrative, expertise, and, its, inland, location, also, providing, conditions, for, military, security, and, enforcement, of, tax, control, a, golden, age, of, development, commenced, in, seville, due, to, its, being, the, only, port, awarded, the, royal, monopoly, for, trade, with, spanish, americas, and, the, influx, of, riches, from, them, since, only, sailing, ships, leaving, from, and, returning, to, the, inland, port, of, seville, could, engage, in, trade, with, the, spanish, americas, merchants, from, europe, and, other, trade, centers, needed, to, be, in, seville, to, acquire, new, world, trade, goods, the, city, s, population, grew, to, more, than, a, hundred, thousand, people, in, the, early, 17th, c, seville, s, monopoly, on, overseas, trade, was, broken, with, the, port, of, c, diz, now, the, monopoly, port, of, trade, as, silting, of, the, guadalquivir, river, in, the, 1620s, made, seville, s, harbors, harder, to, use, the, great, plague, of, seville, in, 1649, exacerbated, by, excessive, flooding, of, the, guadalquivir, reduced, the, population, by, almost, half, and, it, did, not, recover, until, the, early, 19th, century, by, the, 18th, century, seville, s, international, importance, was, in, steep, decline, after, the, monopoly, port, for, the, trade, to, the, americas, was, relocated, to, c, diz, c, diz, had, gifted, the, bourbon, claimant, to, the, throne, in, the, war, of, the, spanish,

house, of, trade, were, consolidated, in, a, single, repository, one, scholar, argues, that, the, establishment, of, the, archive, of, the, indies, marks, a, decisive, moment, in, spain, s, history, with, the, 18th, c, bourbon, monarchy, conceiving, of, its, overseas, territories, as, colonies, of, the, metropole, rather, than, entities, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, crown, on, an, equal,
