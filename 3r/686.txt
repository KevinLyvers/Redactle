together, with, part, of, south, asia, was, well, known, by, europeans, as, the, east, indies, or, simply, the, indies, until, the, 20th, century, chinese, sources, referred, to, the, region, as, nanyang, which, literally, means, the, southern, ocean, the, mainland, section, of, southeast, asia, was, referred, to, as, indochina, by, european, geographers, due, to, its, location, between,

south, china, sea, administrative, centre, in, putrajaya, southeast, asia, is, geographically, divided, into, two, subregions, namely, mainland, southeast, asia, or, the, indochinese, peninsula, and, maritime, southeast, asia, mainland, southeast, asia, includes, maritime, southeast, asia, includes, while, peninsular, malaysia, is, geographically, situated, in, mainland, southeast, asia, it, shares, many, similar, cultural, and, ecological, affinities, with, surrounding, islands, thus, it, is, often, grouped, with, them, as, part, of, maritime, southeast, asia, geographically, the, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, of, india, is, also, considered, a, part, of, maritime, southeast, asia, eastern, bangladesh, and, northeast, india, have, strong, cultural, ties, with, mainland, southeast, asia, and, are, sometimes, considered, transregional, areas, between, south, asia, and, southeast, asia, to, the, east, hong, kong, is, sometimes, regarded, as, part, of, southeast, asia, similarly, christmas, island, and, the, cocos, keeling, islands, have, strong, cultural, ties, with, maritime, southeast, asia, and, are, sometimes, considered, transregional, areas, between, southeast, asia, and, australia, oceania, on, some, occasions, sri, lanka, has, been, considered, a, part, of, southeast, asia, because, of, its, cultural, and, religious, ties, to, mainland, southeast, asia, the, eastern, half, of, the, island, of, new, guinea, which, is, not, a, part, of, indonesia, namely, papua, new, guinea, is, sometimes, included, as, a, part, of, maritime, southeast, asia, and, so, are, guam, the, northern, mariana, islands, and, palau, which, were, all, parts, of, the, spanish, east, indies, with, strong, cultural, and, linguistic, ties, to, the, region, specifically, the, philippines, east, timor, and, the, eastern, half, of, indonesia, east, of, the, wallace, line, in, the, region, of, wallacea, are, considered, to, be, geographically, associated, with, oceania, due, to, their, distinctive, faunal, features, geologically, the, island, of, new, guinea, and, its, surrounding, islands, are, considered, as, parts, of, the, australian, continent, connected, via, the, sahul, shelf, both, christmas, island, and, the, cocos, keeling, islands, are, located, on, the, australian, plate, south, of, the, sunda, trench, even, though, they, are, geographically, closer, to, maritime, southeast, asia, than, mainland, australia, these, two, australian, external, territories, are, not, geologically, associated, with, asia, as, none, of, them, is, actually, on, the, sunda, plate, the, un, statistics, division, s, geoscheme, which, is, a, un, political, geography, tool, created, specifically, for, statistical, purposes, has, classified, both, island, territories, as, parts, of, oceania, under, the, unsd, subregion, australia, and, new, zealand, australasia, some, definitions, of, southeast, asia, may, include, taiwan, taiwan, has, sometimes, been, included, in, southeast, asia, as, well, as, east, asia, but, is, not, a, member, of, asean, likewise, a, similar, argument, could, be, applied, to, some, southern, parts, of, mainland, china, as, well, as, hong, kong, and, macau, may, also, considered, as, part, of, southeast, asia, as, well, as, east, asia, but, are, not, members, of, asean, the, region, was, already, inhabited, by, homo, erectus, from, approximately, 1, 500, 000, years, ago, during, the, middle, pleistocene, age, distinct, homo, sapiens, groups, ancestral, to, eastern, non, african, related, to, east, asians, as, well, as, papuans, populations, reached, the, region, by, between, 50, 000bc, to, 70, 000bc, with, some, arguing, earlier, rock, art, parietal, art, dating, from, 40, 000, years, ago, which, is, currently, the, world, s, oldest, has, been, discovered, in, the, caves, of, borneo, homo, floresiensis, also, lived, in, the, area, up, until, at, least, 50, 000, years, ago, after, which, they, became, extinct, during, much, of, this, time, the, present, day, islands, of, western, indonesia, were, joined, into, a, single, landmass, known, as, sundaland, due, to, lower, sea, levels, ancient, remains, of, hunter, gatherers, in, maritime, southeast, asia, such, as, one, holocene, hunter, gatherer, from, south, sulawesi, had, ancestry, from, both, the, papuan, related, and, east, asian, related, branches, of, the, eastern, non, african, lineage, the, hunter, gatherer, individual, had, approximately, 50, basal, east, asian, ancestry, and, was, positioned, in, between, modern, east, asians, and, papuans, of, oceania, the, authors, concluded, that, east, asian, related, ancestry, expanded, from, mainland, southeast, asia, into, maritime, southeast, asia, much, earlier, than, previously, suggested, as, early, as, 25, 000bc, long, before, the, expansion, of, austroasiatic, and, austronesian, groups, distinctive, basal, east, asian, east, eurasian, ancestry, was, recently, found, to, have, originated, in, mainland, southeast, asia, at, 50, 000bc, and, expanded, through, multiple, migration, waves, southwards, and, northwards, respectively, geneflow, of, east, asian, related, ancestry, into, maritime, southeast, asia, and, oceania, could, be, estimated, to, 25, 000bc, possibly, also, earlier, the, pre, neolithic, papuan, related, populations, of, maritime, southeast, asia, were, largely, replaced, by, the, expansion, of, various, east, asian, related, populations, beginning, about, 50, 000bc, to, 25, 000bc, years, ago, from, mainland, southeast, asia, the, remainders, known, as, negritos, form, small, minority, groups, in, geographically, isolated, regions, southeast, asia, was, dominated, by, east, asian, related, ancestry, already, in, 15, 000bc, predating, the, expansion, of, austroasiatic, and, austronesian, peoples, in, the, late, neolithic, the, austronesian, peoples, who, form, the, majority, of, the, modern, population, in, brunei, indonesia, east, timor, malaysia, and, the, philippines, migrated, to, southeast, asia, from, taiwan, in, the, first, seaborne, human, migration, known, as, the, austronesian, expansion, they, arrived, in, the, northern, philippines, between, 7, 000, bc, to, 2, 200, bc, and, rapidly, spread, further, into, the, northern, mariana, islands, and, borneo, by, 1500, bc, island, melanesia, by, 1300, bc, and, to, the, rest, of, indonesia, malaysia, southern, vietnam, and, palau, by, 1000, bc, they, often, settled, along, coastal, areas, replacing, and, assimilating, the, diverse, preexisting, peoples, the, austronesian, peoples, of, southeast, asia, have, been, seafarers, for, thousands, of, years, they, spread, eastwards, to, micronesia, and, polynesia, as, well, as, westwards, to, madagascar, becoming, the, ancestors, of, modern, day, malagasy, micronesians, melanesians, and, polynesians, passage, through, the, indian, ocean, aided, the, colonisation, of, madagascar, as, well, as, commerce, between, western, asia, eastern, coast, of, india, and, chinese, southern, coast, gold, from, sumatra, is, thought, to, have, reached, as, far, west, as, rome, pliny, the, elder, wrote, in, his, natural, history, about, chryse, and, argyre, two, legendary, islands, rich, in, gold, and, silver, located, in, the, indian, ocean, their, vessels, such, as, the, vinta, were, capable, to, sail, across, the, ocean, magellan, s, voyage, records, how, much, more, manoeuvrable, their, vessels, were, as, compared, to, the, european, ships, a, slave, from, the, sulu, sea, was, believed, to, have, been, used, in, the, magellan, expedition, as, a, translator, studies, presented, by, the, human, genome, organisation, hugo, through, genetic, studies, of, the, various, peoples, of, asia, show, empirically, that, there, was, a, single, migration, event, from, africa, whereby, the, early, people, travelled, along, the, south, coast, of, asia, first, entered, the, malay, peninsula, 50, 000, 90, 000, years, ago, the, orang, asli, in, particular, the, semang, who, show, negrito, characteristics, are, the, direct, descendants, of, these, earliest, settlers, of, southeast, asia, these, early, people, diversified, and, travelled, slowly, northwards, to, china, and, the, populations, of, southeast, asia, show, greater, genetic, diversity, than, the, younger, population, of, china, solheim, and, others, have, shown, evidence, for, a, nusantao, maritime, trading, network, ranging, from, vietnam, to, the, rest, of, the, archipelago, as, early, as, 5000, bc, to, 1, ad, the, bronze, age, dong, son, culture, flourished, in, northern, vietnam, from, about, 1000, bc, to, 1, bc, its, influence, spread, to, other, parts, southeast, asia, the, region, entered, the, iron, age, era, in, 500, bc, when, iron, was, forged, also, in, northern, vietnam, still, under, dong, son, due, to, its, frequent, interactions, with, neighbouring, china, most, southeast, asian, people, were, originally, animist, engaged, in, ancestors, nature, and, spirits, worship, these, belief, systems, were, later, supplanted, by, hinduism, and, buddhism, after, the, region, especially, coastal, areas, came, under, contact, with, indian, subcontinent, during, the, first, century, indian, brahmins, and, traders, brought, hinduism, to, the, region, and, made, contacts, with, local, courts, local, rulers, converted, to, hinduism, or, buddhism, and, adopted, indian, religious, traditions, to, reinforce, their, legitimacy, elevate, ritual, status, above, their, fellow, chief, counterparts, and, facilitate, trade, with, south, asian, states, they, periodically, invited, indian, brahmins, into, their, realms, and, began, a, gradual, process, of, indianisation, in, the, region, shaivism, was, the, dominant, religious, tradition, of, many, southern, indian, hindu, kingdoms, during, the, first, century, it, then, spread, into, southeast, asia, via, bay, of, bengal, indochina, then, malay, archipelago, leading, to, thousands, of, shiva, temples, on, the, islands, of, indonesia, as, well, as, cambodia, and, vietnam, co, evolving, with, buddhism, in, the, region, theravada, buddhism, entered, the, region, during, the, third, century, via, maritime, trade, routes, between, the, region, and, sri, lanka, buddhism, later, established, a, strong, presence, in, funan, region, in, the, fifth, century, in, present, day, mainland, southeast, asia, theravada, is, still, the, dominant, branch, of, buddhism, practised, by, the, thai, burmese,

its, native, people, were, predominantly, animists, until, the, 15th, century, when, islam, began, to, spread, in, those, areas, while, in, vietnam, buddhism, never, managed, to, develop, strong, institutional, networks, due, to, strong, chinese, influence, in, present, day, southeast, asia, vietnam, is, the, only, country, where, its, folk, religion, makes, up, the, plurality, recently, vietnamese, folk, religion, is, undergoing, a, revival, with, the, support, of, the, government, elsewhere, there, are, ethnic, groups, in, southeast, asia, that, resisted, conversion, and, still, retain, their, original, animist, beliefs, such, as, the, dayaks, in, kalimantan, the, igorots, in, luzon, and, the, shans, in, eastern, myanmar, after, the, region, came, under, contact, with, the, indian, subcontinent, c, 400, bce, it, began, a, gradual, process, of, indianisation, where, indian, ideas, such, as, religions, cultures, architectures, and, political, administrations, were, brought, by, traders, and, religious, figures, and, adopted, by, local, rulers, in, turn, indian, brahmins, and, monks, were, invited, by, local, rulers, to, live, in, their, realms, and, help, transforming, local, polities, to, become, more, indianised, blending, indian, and, indigenous, traditions, sanskrit, and, pali, became, the, elite, language, of, the, region, which, effectively, made, southeast, asia, part, of, the, indosphere, most, of, the, region, had, been, indianised, during, the, first, centuries, while, the, philippines, later, indianised, c, ninth, century, when, kingdom, of, tondo, was, established, in, luzon, vietnam, especially, its, northern, part, was, never, fully, indianised, due, to, the, many, periods, of, chinese, domination, it, experienced, the,

java, circa, second, century, ce, this, hindu, kingdom, was, known, by, the, greeks, as, argyre, land, of, silver, by, the, fifth, century, ce, trade, networking, between, east, and, west, was, concentrated, in, the, maritime, route, foreign, traders, were, starting, to, use, new, routes, such, as, malacca, and, sunda, strait, due, to, the, development, of, maritime, southeast, asia, this, change, resulted, in, the, decline, of, funan, while, new, maritime, powers, such, as, srivijaya, tarumanagara, and, mataram, emerged, srivijaya, especially, became, the, dominant, maritime, power, for, more, than, 5, centuries, controlling, both, strait, of, malacca, and, sunda, strait, this, dominance, started, to, decline, when, srivijaya, were, invaded, by, chola, empire, a, dominant, maritime, power, of, indian, subcontinent, in, 1025, the, invasion, reshaped, power, and, trade, in, the, region, resulted, in, the, rise, of, new, regional, powers, such, as, the, khmer, empire, and,
